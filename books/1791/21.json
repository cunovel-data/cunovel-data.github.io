Sterns would light a fire in the hearth in Caine\u0027s study, and the three of them would read in companionable silence.\n Over the years, Sterns had actually become Caine\u0027s substitute father. Jade learned that the servant had been with Caine\u0027s family from the time of Caine\u0027s birth. When Caine established his own residence, Sterns had followed.\n Sterns did let her know he was aware of the new sleeping arrangements. While she blushed with mortification, he announced that he certainly wasn\u0027t judgmental. He also added that he hadn\u0027t seen\n Caine so carefree in a good long while. Jade, he decreed, had lightened the Marquess\u0027s mood.\n A messenger arrived from Caine\u0027s mother, requesting his aid in pulling his father out of his present dire circumstances.\n Caine immediately went to visit his father, but when he returned some two hours later, he was in a foul mood. His talk with his father had come to little good.\n That night, after Caine had fallen asleep, Jade met with Matthew and Jimbo to give them new orders.\n Matthew was waiting for her just a few feet behind the cover of the trees. The seaman was tall, reed thin, and had skin as dark as a panther\u0027s. He had the personality to match the magnificent beast, but only when he was riled. He also had an easy smile that could be quite dazzling when he was in the mood to give it.\n Matthew wasn\u0027t smiling now. He had his arms crossed in front of his chest and was scowling at her just like a man who\u0027d found a thief rummaging through his drawers.\n \"Why are you frowning so, Matthew?\" she asked in a bare whisper.\n \"I saw Him standing at the window with you the other night, girl,\" Matthew grumbled. \"Has that dandy been touching you?\"\n Jade didn\u0027t want to lie, but she wasn\u0027t about to share the truth with her trusted friend, either. \"I was injured,\" she replied. \"Now don\u0027t give me that look, Matthew. I took a pistol shot in my side. It was a paltry wound. Caine was . . . concerned and he stayed in my chambers that night, watching out for me.\"\n \"Black Harry\u0027s going to feed my arse to the sharks when he hears ...\"\n \"Matthew, you aren\u0027t going to tell Harry anything,\" she interjected.\n The seaman wasn\u0027t at all intimidated by her angry tone. \"You got yourself a sassy mouth,\" he replied.\n \"I seen the fancy man put his arm around you when you were walking to the front door that first day, and I will be telling Harry. That\u0027s a fact you can start cringing over now. Jimbo wanted to put a knife in his back. Only reason he didn\u0027t is because he knew you\u0027d be put out with him.\"\n \"Yes, 1 would be put out,\" she answered. \"No one\u0027s going to touch a hair on Caine\u0027s head or he\u0027ll answer to me. Now quit frowning, Matthew. We have an important issue to discuss.\"\n Matthew didn\u0027t want to let go of their topic. \"But is he giving you real trouble?\"\n \"No, he isn\u0027t giving me any trouble,\" she replied. \"Matthew, you know I can take care of myself. Please have more faith in me.\"\n Matthew was immediately contrite. He didn\u0027t want his mistress to be disappointed in him. \"Of course I know you can take care of yourself,\" he rushed out. \"But you don\u0027t know your own appeal. You\u0027re too pretty for your own good. I\u0027m thinking now Jimbo and Harry were right. We should have cut your face when you was a youngster.\"\n She knew from the sparkle in his handsome brown eyes that he was jesting with her. \"None of you would have dared to harm me,\" she countered. \"We\u0027re family, Matthew, and you love me as much as I love you.\"\n \"You\u0027re nothing but a puny brat,\" came another deep voice. Jade turned toward the sound and watched her friend, Jimbo, silently move to stand directly in front of her. Jimbo\u0027s frown matched his giant\u0027s size. Like Matthew, he was also dressed in drab brown peasant garb, for brighter colors could easily be\n spotted through the branches.\n In the moonlight, Jimbo\u0027s frown looked fierce. \"Matthew told me the dandy touched you. I could kill\n him, just for that. No one\u0027s . . .\"\n \"You\u0027re both underestimating Caine if you think he\u0027ll easily let you put your knives in him,\" she interjected.\n \"I\u0027m betting he\u0027s as puny as Colin,\" Jimbo argued.\n Jade let him see how exasperated she was with him. \"You haven\u0027t seen Colin in quite some time and he was half out of his mind because of his injuries then. He\u0027s probably as fit as ever now. Besides, you\u0027ve made a serious miscalculation if you believe either brother is weak. Remember, Jimbo, I was the one who read Caine\u0027s file. I know what I\u0027m talking about.\"\n \"If the man\u0027s got blood, he can bleed,\" Matthew pronounced.\n Neither seaman seemed affected by her frown. Jade let out a sigh of frustration.\n She turned to Matthew and said, \"I must go and have a little chat with Caine\u0027s father. You must keep Caine occupied with a diversion while I\u0027m away.\"\n \"I don\u0027t see any need for you to talk to Caine\u0027s father,\" Matthew protested. \"Colin and Nathan are bound to show up any time now.\"\n \"The way they\u0027re dawdling? No, I dare not wait any longer. Caine\u0027s father might very well be on his death bed now. He isn\u0027t eating or sleeping. I can\u0027t let him die.\"\n \"I can see you got your mind set,\" Matthew muttered. \"What kind of a diversion are you thinking of?\"\n \"I\u0027ll leave that in your capable hands,\" Jade countered.\n \"When you want it done?\" Jimbo asked.\n \"Tomorrow,\" she answered. \"As early as possible.\"\n Jade finally went back to her bed, content with the knowledge that Matthew and Jimbo wouldn\u0027t let her down.\n The diversion began just bare minutes before dawn the following morning.\n She realized then that she should have been more specific with her instructions. And when this was over, she was going to have Matthew\u0027s hide. His capable hands, indeed. The man had set the stables on fire. Fortunately, he\u0027d had enough sense to let the horses out first.\n Caine was occupied, she\u0027d give Matthew that much credit. The horses were running wild. Three were about ready to drop their foals, and every hand was needed to squelch the spreading fire and chase the animals down.\n She pretended to be asleep until Caine left the room.\n Then she dressed in quick time and slipped out the back way. Caine had posted guards around the perimeter, but in the chaos, she was easily able to sneak past.\n \"Jimbo just left for Shallow\u0027s Wharf,\" Matthew told Jade as he assisted her onto the mount he\u0027d chosen for her. \"He should be back by sunset tomorrow with word for us. If the winds are strong, don\u0027t you suppose Nathan will be here soon? And are you certain you don\u0027t want me riding along with you?\"\n \"I\u0027m certain I want you to keep your guard on Caine\u0027s back,\" she replied. \"He\u0027s the one in danger. I\u0027ll be back in an hour. And Matthew? Don\u0027t set anything else on fire while I\u0027m gone.\"\n Matthew gave her a wide grin. \"It did the trick, didn\u0027t it now?\"\n \"Aye, Matthew,\" she answered, not wishing to injure his pride. \"It did do the trick.\"\n She left Matthew smiling after her and arrived at her destination a half hour later. After leaving her horse in the woods adjacent to the property line, she quickly made her way to the front door. The house was monstrous, but the lock was puny by any thief\u0027s standards. Jade had it unlatched in bare minutes. There was enough light filtering through the windows for her to make her way up the winding staircase. Sounds radiated from the back of the house, indicating that the kitchen staff was already at work.\n Jade was as quiet as a cat as she looked into each of the numerous bedrooms. The Duke of Williamshire couldn\u0027t be found in any of them, however. She had assumed he\u0027d be occupying the largest bedchamber, but that giant\u0027s room was empty. A blond-headed, rather attractive elderly woman who snored like a sailor occupied the adjacent bedchamber. Jade guessed the woman was the Duchess.\n At the end of the long corridor in the south wing, she found the library. It was an out-of-the-way, unusual place to house the study. Caine\u0027s father was inside. He was sound asleep in his chair behind the mahogany desk.\n After locking the door against intruders, Jade studied the handsome man for a long while. He was very distinguished looking with silver-tipped hair, high, patrician cheekbones, and an angular face very similar to Caine\u0027s. There were deep circles under his eyes. The color of his skin was sallow. Even in sleep he looked as though he was in torment.\n Jade couldn\u0027t decide if she should blister him with a stern lecture or apologize for causing him such needless pain.\n Her heart went out to him, though. He reminded her of Caine, of course, though the father certainly wasn\u0027t as muscular. He certainly had the height, however. When she touched his shoulder, he came awake with a start and bounded out of his chair with a quickness that surprised her.\n \"Please don\u0027t be alarmed, sir,\" she whispered. \"I didn\u0027t mean to startle you.\"\n \"You didn\u0027t?\" he asked, imitating her low tone of voice.\n The Duke of Williamshire slowly regained his composure. He ran his fingers through his hair, then shook his head in an attempt to clear his mind.\n \"Who are you?\" he asked.\n \"It doesn\u0027t matter who I am, sir,\" she answered. \"Please sit down, for I have important information to share with you.\"\n She patiently waited until he\u0027d obeyed her request, then leaned against the edge of the desktop close to his side. \"This grieving must stop. You\u0027ve made yourself ill.\"\n \"What?\"\n He still looked confused to her. She noticed, too, that the color of his eyes was the exact shade of gray as Caine\u0027s. His frown was similar as well.\n \"I said that you must stop grieving,\" she stated again. \"Sir Harwick thinks you might well be dying. If you don\u0027t stop this nonsense . . .\"\n \"Now see here, young lady .. .\"\n \"Do not raise your voice to me,\" she interjected.\n \"Who in God\u0027s name are you? And how did you get into . ..\"\n The bluster went out of him and he slowly shook his head.\n Jade thought he seemed more incredulous than angry. She decided that was a good beginning.\n \"Sir, I simply don\u0027t have time for a lengthy discussion. First, you must give me your promise that you\u0027ll never tell anyone about our conversation. Do you give me your word?\"\n \"You have it,\" he replied.\n \"Good. Now, I believe I must apologize to you, though in truth I\u0027m no good at it. I hate apologizing to anyone.\" She shrugged, then added, \"I\u0027m sorry I didn\u0027t come to you sooner. You\u0027ve been caused needless grief, and I really could have spared you. Do you forgive me?\"\n \"I have no idea what you\u0027re talking about, but if it will make you happy, I shall forgive you. Now tell me what it is you want from me.\"\n \"Your bark, sir, is just as irritating as your son\u0027s.\"\n \"And which son is that?\" he asked, a hint of a smile coming into his eyes.\n \"Caine.\"\n \"Is this visitation concerning Caine? Has he done something to offend you? You might as well know\n now that Caine\u0027s his own man. I won\u0027t interfere unless there\u0027s real cause.\"\n \"No,\" Jade answered. \"This isn\u0027t about Caine, though I\u0027m happy to know you have such faith in your eldest son\u0027s ability to make his own decisions. By not interfering, you show your pride in your son.\"\n \"Then who is it you wish to discuss?\" he asked.\n \"I\u0027m a friend of Colin\u0027s.\"\n \"You knew him?\"\n She nodded. \"I know him, yes. You see, he\u0027s . ..\"\n \"Dead,\" he interjected, his tone harsh. \"Pagan killed him.\"\n Jade reached out and put her hand on his shoulder. \"Look at me, please,\" she commanded in a soft whisper when he turned his gaze toward the windows.\n When Caine\u0027s father did as she ordered, she nodded. \"What I am about to tell you will be difficult for you to believe. First, understand this. I have proof.\"\n \"Proof?\"\n She nodded again. \"Pagan didn\u0027t kill Colin.\"\n \"He did.\"\n \"I\u0027m sick of hearing about Pagan\u0027s sins,\" she muttered. \"Colin . . .\"\n \"Did Pagan send you to me?\"\n \"Please lower your voice,\" she returned. \"Pagan didn\u0027t kill your son,\" she repeated. \"He saved him. Colin\u0027s very much alive.\"\n A long minute elapsed before the Duke reacted. His face slowly turned a blotchy shade of red while he stared at her. His eyes turned so cold, she thought he might cause frostbite.\n Before he could shout at her again, she said, \"I told you I had proof. Are you willing to listen to me or\n is your mind so set . . .\"\n \"I will listen,\" he returned. \"Though if this be some sort of cruel jest, I swear I\u0027ll hunt Pagan down\n myself and kill him with my bare hands.\"\n \"That is a fair exchange for such cruelty,\" she agreed. \"Do you remember the time when Colin had climbed up a giant tree and couldn\u0027t get down? He was four or five years old then. Because he was\n crying and feeling very cowardly, you promised him you\u0027d never tell anyone. You also convinced him\n that it was quite all right to be afraid, that fear was not a sin, that. . .\"\n \"I remember,\" the Duke whispered. \"I never did te\u0027 anyone. How did you . . .\"\n \"As I just said, Colin told me that story. Many others, too.\"\n \"He could have told you these stories before he was killed,\" the Duke stated.\n \"Yes, he could have, but he didn\u0027t. Pagan fished Colin out of the ocean. Your son was in sorry shape.\n Do you know the physician, Sir Winters?\"\n \"He\u0027s my personal physician,\" the Duke muttered.\n \"Don\u0027t you think it odd that he disappeared?\"\n The anger was slowly easing away from the elderly man\u0027s expression. \"I do think that odd,\" he admitted.\n \"We took him,\" Jade explained. \"He was needed to tend to Colin. I thought it important that your son have his family physician. He was in terrible pain, sir, and I wanted him to have as many familiar comforts as possible.\"\n Jade nibbled on her lower lip while she contemplated another way to convince him. He still looked disbelieving to her. \"Colin has a birthmark on his backside,\" she suddenly blurted out. \"I know because\n I took care of him until Jimbo and Matthew could take Winters captive. There! Is that proof enough for you?\"\n In answer to that question, the Duke slowly leaned back in his chair. \"Proof was sent of Colin\u0027s death.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/guardian-angel-crown-s-spies-2/page-21.html","bookId":1791,"book":{"id":1791,"title":"Guardian Angel (Crown\u0027s Spies #2)","description":"Storyline: \n The Emerald flew across the seas, carrying the pirate Pagan -- despised by the ton, whose riches he plundered, and beloved by the poor, whose plight was eased by his gifts. \n The Marquess of Cainewood vows to hunt down the pirate wretch in revenge for his brother\u0027s death.
