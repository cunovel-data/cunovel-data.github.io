{"id":18714,"no":18,"title":"Chapter 17: Knighted.","content":"Rain was coming down in torrents, when Oswald and Roger started the next morning. On leaving the town they turned to the left, with the intention of making a considerable detour; keeping well away from the road, as it was near this that the Welsh would be most likely watching. They chose this side because, to the right of the road, the country was more broken, rising swell after swell towards Plinlimmon; and it was likely that the largest portion of the Welsh would be on that side, so that they could, at any time, retire to their fastnesses. They were soon in the woods. The streams they met with were turbid, and full to the brim. \"We shall have trouble with this water, Roger,\" Oswald said, as they waded across one, waist deep. \"This is but a little stream, but if there are larger ones, as is like enough, we shall have to swim before we are done. There is one advantage; in such weather as this, even the Welsh will scarce be active.\" \"They have not got much clothing to wet,\" Roger said. \"Their dress is better suited than ours for such weather.\" The way was a rough one. Hills, although of no great height, had to be crossed, and many streams to be waded. Fortunately, they met with few larger than that they had first crossed; for the water from that side of the hills made its way, for the most part, direct into the Severn; while that which came down from the slopes of Plinlimmon, towards the road, fell into a stream; dry in fine weather, but now a raging torrent, which ran past Llandulas and into the Severn, at Llanidloes. \"Do you think that we are going right, Roger?\" Oswald said, after they had been walking for six or seven hours; \"for, what with these ups and downs, and turnings and windings, there is no saying which is east and which is west. If the sun were shining we should be sure of our direction, but with these dull leaden clouds there is no saying.\" \"I have no idea, master. If we were out on a moor we should be able to judge, and to make a fairly straight course, keeping the wind and rain on one side of us; but in this thick forest, though most of the leaves have fallen, those that remain on the branches break up the rain, and it seems to come straight down upon us.\" Presently they came to another watercourse. \"Why, Roger, the water is going in the other direction!\" \"So it is, master. How can that be?\" \"It is just possible that we have crossed some dividing point, and the water is making its way towards the south, and will fall into some other river; but I am very much afraid that the real explanation is, that we have entirely lost our way, and are going in the opposite direction to that in which we started. The question is, shall we cross it or shall we follow it down?\" \"Just as you like,\" Roger said. \"For myself, I think that the best way would be to find some place where we could shelter. Tomorrow the sun may be out again, and that will tell us which way to go. If we start at daybreak, and keep it to our back, we can\u0027t go far wrong.\" \"Except that we may pass the army altogether, Roger. They told us that the rearmost division was not more than ten miles ahead.\" \"We must have walked double that already, I should say, master.\" \"Not so much as that. We have been a long time over it, but it is slow travelling over this broken ground, and thick wood. I am sure I hope that we have not gone twenty miles, or anything like it; for in that case, if we have been keeping fairly in the right direction, we must have passed the army. If we have been going in the wrong direction, there is no saying where we may be. \"Still, I think that your suggestion is a good one. It is of no use our going on, when we may be getting farther away at every step. It is lucky that we bought these thick cloaks, at Welshpool; for without them we should have been soaked to the skin, hours ago.\" \"Well, as we have been wetted to the waist a score of times, in the streams, I don\u0027t see that it would have mattered much, if the rest of us had been wet through.\" \"Well, now let us look for a shelter.\" After searching for half an hour, they found a spot where a wall of shaly rock barred their way. At one spot some of this had fallen in, forming a sort of shallow cave, some three feet deep. \"This is not a bad beginning, Roger, but we must try and make it a great deal more snug.\" They first cut down some young fir poles, and placed them so as to form a sort of penthouse against the wall. On these they piled a number of branches, of the same trees, until it was over a foot in thickness. \"So far, so good,\" Oswald said. \"Now, Roger, look about for a fallen tree. We have passed scores on our way. You must get a thoroughly rotten one, and cut away a portion of the under side; it will be dry enough, there.\" \"You might get a little of that to start with,\" Roger said; \"but the ground is covered everywhere with fir cones, and there is no better stuff for fires.\" Taking off his cloak he laid it down, and they both piled the fir cones on this, until a great heap was collected. This they carried into their shelter, through an opening they had left in the penthouse. \"We must have something dry to start it with. These cones are a great deal too wet to burn, without a good heat to start them. There is nothing better than the fir needles, master, if we can find some dry ones.\" After some searching, a considerable number of these needles were collected; some lying under fallen trees, and others swept by the wind into rocky corners, where the rain had not reached them. Now, I think we shall do, Roger \"Now I think that we shall do, Roger.\" As soon as they were inside, Roger produced a large lump of dry fungus he had found, on the other side of the Severn; and, by the aid of his flint and steel, soon succeeded in striking sparks upon it. As soon as these began to spread, he put a little pile of fir needles on it; and, blowing gently, bright flames soon darted up. A few more handfuls of fuel were added, and fir cones placed at the top; and in a quarter of an hour, a clear, bright fire was burning. The dripping cloaks were hung up to the fir poles, to dry; and the jerkins, which were also damp, although the water had not penetrated through them, were spread near the fire. \"It was well that I bought this little skin of wine, last night,\" Roger said. \"You thought it was better to be without such a burden, but the weight of a gallon of wine doesn\u0027t count for much, and it makes all the difference in our comfort, here.\" The rain had soaked through their provision bags, but the bread and meat in the centre were dry; and of these they made a hearty meal and, laying the wetted food round the fire to dry, they wound up the repast with a long draught of wine. \"Now, as soon as our breeches are dry, Master Oswald, we shall be thoroughly comfortable.\" \"Yes, one can wish for nothing better. But we must not forget that some Welshmen may come along, and if so, will be sure to want to know what is inside.\" \"Then, unless there happen to be more than a dozen of them, their curiosity may cost them dear,\" Roger said grimly. \"I don\u0027t think there is much fear of it. We have neither seen nor heard of any, since we started; and it would be evil fortune, indeed, if a party happened to come along just at this spot.\" \"The fact that we have heard no one is a bad sign, Roger; for it would seem to show that we must have gone a long way out of our course.\" The rain continued to fall heavily, all that afternoon and throughout the night, and no change of the weather was discernible the next morning. \"We had best stop here for another day, Roger, unless the sky clears; we are not likely to find so good a place for shelter, and it is of no use to wander about, when every step may be taking us farther away. However, we can climb up to the top of this hill, at whose foot we are, and endeavour to get a view over the country.\" Roger shook his head. \"In this heavy mist we should not see a quarter of a mile away. We have got all our clothes dry, now, and it would be a pity to get them wet again, without need or profit. Anyhow, we will find some more of those fir cones. Our supply is nearly gone.\" In half an hour they had got sufficient to last them all day. There was nothing for them then to do but sleep, one or other keeping watch, so as to prevent the chance of their being surprised. Before lying down for the night, Roger looked out. \"Methinks that the rain has stopped, though it would be difficult to say, for the drops keep pattering down from the trees. Well, I mightily hope that it will be a fine morning.\" Oswald was first upon his feet and, on going out, uttered an exclamation of satisfaction. The morning was breaking and, though light clouds were moving across the sky, glimpses of the blue were visible, here and there. Already the light showed where the sun would presently rise. Food was hastily eaten, and they then started on their way again. There could be no mistake, now, as to the general direction; and, keeping the sun on their right hand, they made their way north. From the top of a hill, somewhat higher than the others, they caught a view of Plinlimmon. \"If we make straight for it,\" Oswald said, \"we ought to come down on the road near the camp. We can go on fearlessly for some time, for the Welsh were hardly likely to be moving about, yesterday or the day before; and I have no doubt they sheltered themselves, as best they could, in arbours like ours.\" After walking for another two hours, they heard the distant sound of a trumpet. \"That cannot be more than two or three miles away, Roger. Now, we shall have to be careful.\" They had walked a mile when, as they descended into a glen, they came suddenly on a party of twenty Welshmen, sitting round a fire. These had been concealed from them by the thick undergrowth, and were not twenty yards away, when they first saw them. The Welsh had evidently heard them coming, by the rustle of leaves and the breaking of twigs; and two or three were standing up, looking in their direction, when they caught sight of them. These gave a loud yell, which brought the rest to their feet. \"Run, Roger, run. It is a question of legs, now;\" and, turning, they darted up the hill they had just descended. Looking back for a moment as, after running for about a mile, they reached the crest of a swell; Oswald saw that five of their pursuers had distanced their comrades, but were no nearer than when they started. \"I think we can hold them, Roger. Take it a little more easily now. We are all right as far as speed goes. It is simply a question of bottom.\" Their pursuers, however, still stuck to them and, after running for another half-mile, the five men were still but some thirty yards behind; while their comrades\u0027 shouts could be heard through the forests and, from time to time, the men close behind them joined in a loud quavering cry. \"We must stand and rid ourselves of these fellows, Roger; or we shall have half the Welsh nation down on us.\" \"So I have been thinking, for some time.\" \"Don\u0027t stop suddenly. We will slacken our pace, and they will think that our strength is failing, and will redouble their efforts. Then, when they are close to us, we will turn suddenly.\" They heard a yell of exultation, as their pursuers found that they were gaining upon them. \"Choose a clear space, Roger, with room to swing our weapons.\" The Welsh were running in a close body, but ten yards behind them, when they arrived at a spot clear of trees. \"Now, Roger!\" As he spoke, Oswald drew his sword and swung round, facing his pursuers, while Roger did the same. The Welsh, taken by surprise, endeavoured to check themselves; but before they could do so, Roger\u0027s staff fell upon the head of one of them, while Oswald cleft another to the chin. With the quickness of an adroit player with the quarterstaff, Roger followed up his blow by almost instantaneously driving the other end of the staff, with all his force, against the chest of another, who was at the point of leaping upon him; and the man fell, as if struck with a thunderbolt. So swift had been the movements that the remaining two men were paralysed, by the sudden fall of their companions; but before they could turn to fly, the weapons descended again, with as fatal result as before. \"To the right!\" Oswald exclaimed, and he dashed off into the forest again, at a right angle to the line that they had before taken. A minute later they heard an outburst of yells of fury, from the spot they had quitted. \"I don\u0027t think they will be quite so ready to follow, now,\" Roger said. \"They are like to be some time, before they take up our track again.\" \"We will break into a walk, in a few minutes, Roger; and then go along quietly, and keep our ears open. Their yells will be bringing others down, from all directions, and we might run right into the middle of another party, if we kept on at this rate.\" In another five minutes they dashed down a steep descent, at whose foot a streamlet, swelled now into a rushing stream, five or six feet wide, was running. \"We will follow this down,\" Oswald said, as he stepped into it. It was a little over two feet deep, and they waded along it for a couple of hundred yards, and then stepped out, where some rock cropped out by the side of the stream. It had not yet dried after the rain, and their feet therefore left no marks on it. \"That was a sharp run, Roger,\" Oswald said as, with rapid but stealthy steps, they strode along. \"Ay, it was. My breath was coming short, when you gave the word to stop. Another half mile would have finished me. Those Welshmen run well.\" \"I have no doubt we should have beaten them, easily enough, on the open ground, Roger; but they are more accustomed to this forest work than we are. \"Mind where you tread, and don\u0027t put your foot on fallen sticks. There must be scores of them in the forest behind, yet, though I don\u0027t think that they have struck our track. The nearest must be a quarter of a mile away. I am not afraid of their overtaking us. It is the risk of falling in with other parties that I am afraid of.\" They now bore away to the right again. More than once they heard parties moving near them, and stood quiet until their voices died away; which they quickly did, as all were hurrying towards the spot whence the shouting still continued. For an hour they kept straight onward, and then the trees thinned; and as they stepped out from the edge of the forest they saw, to their delight, a few tents in front of them, and a large number of soldiers scattered about. As they were seen, some of the soldiers caught up their arms; but when they saw that but two men were approaching, they laid them down again, and proceeded with the work on which most of them were engaged; in polishing up their arms and armour, whose brightness had been grievously dimmed by the rain. A sub-officer with four men came up to them, as they reached the line. \"Who are you, sirs?\" he asked. \"I am an esquire of Sir Henry Percy, and have brought hither a letter for the king.\" The man looked doubtfully at him, and Oswald continued, \"I know not whether the Earl of Talbot is in the camp, but if so he will, I think, recognize me.\" \"The earl arrived, with five hundred of his men, yesterday,\" the officer said, with a tone of more respect than he had before used. \"I will take you to his tent;\" and he led the way to a tent, pitched a short distance away from that before which the royal standard waved. Oswald took off his cloak, which was rolled up over his shoulder, and handed it to Roger, and then opened his jerkin. As they came up to the tent the front opened, and the earl himself came out. \"Whom have we here?\" he asked the officer. \"They have just come out of the forest, my lord, and this gentleman asked to be taken to you, saying that you would recognize him.\" The earl looked scrutinizingly at Oswald. \"I seem to know your face, sir,\" he said, \"but I cannot recall where I have seen it.\" \"My name is Oswald Forster, an esquire of Sir Henry Percy. I joined you at Chester, my Lord Talbot, with a band of his men; and some of Sir Edmund Mortimer\u0027s, led by one of his knights.\" \"I remember now,\" the earl said. \"Yes, I see you wear the Percy badge; but how have you got here, and why have you come?\" \"I come as a simple messenger, my lord. A royal courier arrived at Ludlow, with a letter from London for the king. His majesty had laid his commands on Sir Edmund Mortimer, that he was not to weaken his force by a single lance; and as, for aught Sir Edmund knew, the letter might be of great importance, I volunteered to endeavour to carry it through; taking with me only this man-at-arms, on whom I could wholly rely, whatever might happen, he having accompanied me on more than one dangerous expedition. \"Sir Edmund consented. We rode first to Shrewsbury, to obtain information as to the course the king had taken. At Welshpool we left our horses behind us, thinking it easier to make our way through the woods on foot, seeing that the roads were said to be beset by the Welsh. So we reached Llanidloes; and then, hearing where the king was then posted, from a convoy of wounded that had been brought in that day, and who had been attacked and very hardly treated as they came along, we thought to make a detour through the woods, so as to get behind any Welshmen who might be watching the road. \"Unfortunately, in the storm of rain, having no guide, we lost our way; and were so detained, near two days, in the forest. This morning, the weather having changed and the sun come out, we learned the direction that we must take. On the way we fell in with a party of some twenty Welshmen, who pursued us hotly. We outran all but five. As their shouts would have brought large numbers upon us, we stopped and slew them; and though search was hot for us, we succeeded in making our way through, without adventure, until we came out from the forest, close by.\" \"Truly it was an adventure of great peril,\" the earl said, \"for the Welsh are swarming round us; though we see nought of them, when we are once in the saddle. Assuredly you would never have got through, even as far as Llanidloes, if you had followed the road on horseback; for the last party that came along brought word that the Welsh had felled trees across it, in many places, and had broken down the bridges. \"It was a gallant exploit, sir. I will, myself, take you in to the king.\" Oswald took off his jerkin. \"I am but in poor plight to show myself before his majesty,\" he said, as he handed it to Roger. \"Ah! I remember this good fellow,\" the earl said. \"He is not one easily forgotten, for \u0027tis seldom one sees so stout a man-at-arms. \"As to your dress, \u0027tis nought; and indeed, it is in better order than most in camp, for the soldiers have no tents, and have, for the last forty-eight hours, been over their ankles in mud and water. \"Have you been with Mortimer ever since we harried Glendower\u0027s valley?\" \"No, my lord. I returned after that to the north, and was at Alnwick for nine months. Then Sir Henry sent me back again to Ludlow, in order that I might keep him well informed of the extent of this rebellion, concerning which but few tidings came to him.\" They had, by this time, arrived at the entrance of the king\u0027s tent. The two sentries on duty there stood back and saluted, as the earl entered, followed by Oswald. \"This, sire, is a messenger, one Master Oswald Forster, an esquire of Sir Henry Percy\u0027s. He had been sent by his lord to Ludlow, to keep him acquainted with the extent of this rebellion. Some few days since, a royal messenger reached the town, with a letter for you; as doubtless, in London, they cannot have known which way you were marching, and directed it there, so that it might be forwarded to you thence. Sir Edmund, having your royal order not to send any force away, would have been at a loss how to forward it; deeming that it would need a strong body of men-at-arms to penetrate to you, as he knew, from what had happened on the two last expeditions, that the Welsh, being unable to oppose your advance, would swarm behind you, so as to prevent reinforcements or convoys of provisions from reaching you. He was, therefore, doubtful as to what course to adopt, when this gentleman volunteered to carry it to you; and this he has accomplished, attended by but a single follower. Knowing that he could only hope to reach you on foot, he and his man-at-arms left their horses at Welshpool; and have made their way through the woods on foot, not without adventure, having lost their way in the storm, and having slept in the wood for two days, and killed five Welshmen, scarcely escaping a crowd of others as they came in.\" \"A very gallant deed, sir,\" the king said to Oswald, as the latter bent upon one knee and handed the letter to him. \"By Our Lady, it was no slight thing to venture through the woods, swarming with these wild Welshmen. How long have you been an esquire to Percy?\" \"Over three years, sire.\" \"I met Master Forster at Chester,\" the earl said. \"He commanded a score of Percy\u0027s men, and rode with us when we captured Glendower\u0027s house. The knights with him told me that he and his little band had done excellent service, in the fight when the Welsh made their first irruption; and that Sir Henry Percy had written in the warmest terms to Mortimer, saying that the gentleman stood high in his regard, and that he had the most perfect confidence in him, and had selected him for the service since he was able to write well, and could, therefore, communicate freely with him as to the troubles on the Welsh border.\" \"And have you been at Mortimer\u0027s ever since that time?\" the king asked. Oswald noticed that each time Mortimer\u0027s name was mentioned, the king\u0027s brow was somewhat clouded. \"Not so, your majesty. I returned to the north, with Percy\u0027s men, a few days after the capture of Glendower\u0027s house. I came back to Ludlow in the spring.\" \"Why did Sir Henry Percy despatch you there again?\" the king asked, sharply. \"From what he said, sire, it was because he was anxious to know whether the rebellion was growing, fearing that there might be some correspondence between Glendower and the Scots; and that, if it should come to a point when you might have to lead the whole force of the south to put the Welsh down, the Scots might make a great irruption into the northern counties, and it would be needful for him to keep a larger body of men than usual under arms; as the earl, his father, and the Earl of Westmoreland, would have to stand the whole brunt of the matter, for a time, without aid from the south.\" The king\u0027s brow cleared. \"It was a thoughtful act of Sir Henry,\" he said; \"and \u0027tis like enough that the Scots will, as you say, take advantage of our troubles here; and it is well, therefore, that the Lords of the Northern Marches should hold themselves in readiness. \"What think you, Talbot? It seems to me that the bold service this esquire has performed merits reward.\" \"I think so, indeed,\" the earl said. \"It was a singular act of courage.\" The king drew his sword from his scabbard. \"Kneel, sir,\" he said. And, as Oswald knelt, the king laid the sword across his shoulder, and said, \"Rise, Sir Oswald Forster.\" Oswald rose. \"I thank you, my Lord King,\" he said, \"and trust that I may live for many years to do worthy knightly service to my liege, who has so highly honoured me.\" \"My lord,\" the king said to Talbot, \"I leave it to you to see that this young knight is provided with horse and armour. Unfortunately there is more than one suit without an owner, at present. You will do well to wait with me while I open this letter; which, maybe, contains matter of moment.\" Feeling that his audience was over, Oswald bowed deeply, and left the tent to rejoin Roger. \"What said the king, master?\" \"He spoke much more highly of what we had done, Roger, than it deserved; and as a reward for the service, he has just knighted me.\" \"I think that he has done well, master!\" Roger exclaimed, joyously. \"I had hoped that Hotspur would have done it, after that adventure with the Bairds; of which, as Alwyn told me, he spoke to him in tones of wondrous praise.\" \"That was a private business, Roger, and he would know that I would much rather that, when knighthood came, I should receive it for service in the field. The king regards our coming here as a service to himself, and therefore rewarded me; but I would rather that it should have been for service in the field, against the enemy, than for tramping through the forest.\" \"Yes, but a forest full of Welshmen,\" Roger said, \"who are more to be feared, in that way, than when met in open fight.\" \"Earl Talbot spoke very kindly of me, and said that he had heard that, with Percy\u0027s men, I had done good service in that fight with the Welsh, near Knighton.\" \"That was certainly pretty hot work, master--I shall get to say Sir Oswald, in time; but at present my tongue is not used to it. What are we to do now?\" \"The king asked Lord Talbot to provide me with armour, and a horse; so we must wait until he comes this way.\" It was half an hour before the earl came out. \"The letter was of importance,\" he said, \"and it is well that it was brought on. \"Now, Sir Oswald, let us see to your matter. Two days ago Sir William Baxter was killed, by a sudden attack of the Welsh, while he was burning a village. His men rallied, beat off the Welsh, and brought his body in; and methinks his armour will fit you, though he was shorter, by two or three inches, than yourself.\" He accompanied Oswald to one of a small group of tents, standing a quarter of a mile farther down the road. \"Is Sir William Baxter\u0027s squire here?\" A young man at once came up. \"I was his esquire, my lord.\" \"I have the king\u0027s orders,\" the earl said, \"that his arms, armour, and horses are to be handed over, forthwith, to Sir Oswald Forster here, who will take command of his troop. He will take over all the other belongings of the knight.\" The young squire bowed. \"I will hand them over to you, sir.\" \"You will, of course, take possession of the tent also, Sir Oswald. Sir William was one of my knights. He was unwedded, and has no male kin; therefore, you need have no hesitation in taking his belongings; which indeed we should, in any case, have little chance of taking back with us, for our waggons are but few, and will daily become fewer: for on such roads as these, both waggons and horses break down, and it will be as much as we can do to carry even necessities with us. \"Come to my tent at noon, it lacks but an hour of it, and I will present you at dinner to some of my knights; among whom, for the present, I shall rank you.\" So saying, he turned away. The young squire held open the entrance of the tent, for Oswald to enter, and followed him in. \"It seems a strange thing to be thus possessed of another man\u0027s goods,\" he said. \"It is often so,\" the squire said, \"and sometimes even his estates go with them, also. As the earl said, Sir William Baxter had none to whom these things could have been given; seeing that he had, so far as I know, only one sister, to whom armour and horses could be of no use. She is one of the Countess of Talbot\u0027s ladies.\" \"And what are you going to do, yourself?\" \"For the present, I know not,\" the squire said. \"I had been with Sir William Baxter but three years. The knight I served with, before, was thrown from his horse and killed; and Sir William, who had been just knighted, took me into his service.\" \"How long have you been a squire?\" \"Six years, and I hoped that, in this campaign, I might have done something to win my spurs.\" \"I am but a poor knight, Master--\" and he paused. \"Henry Pemberton,\" the squire said. \"And being but knighted today, and having no lands to keep up my knighthood, it may be that the earl will appoint you to another of his knights; but should he not do so, I shall be glad if, for the rest of this campaign, you will ride with me; and trust that you, too, may have an opportunity of gaining knighthood, before it is over. But whether or no, as soon as we cross the border again, I doubt not that you will be able to find some lord under whom you may gain advancement.\" \"I will gladly do so, Sir Oswald. \u0027Tis strange that I should not have seen your face before; for, since we left Worcester, I have come to know the greater part of the esquires here.\" \"I arrived but an hour ago,\" Oswald replied, \"having made my way through the Welsh, on foot, with that tall fellow you saw without.\" \"That was a dangerous deed, truly,\" Pemberton said, in tones of surprise. \"May I ask why you essayed so perilous a feat?\" \"I was the bearer of a despatch for the king. I was an esquire to Sir Henry Percy, but have for some time been staying with his brother-in-law, Sir Edmund Mortimer. \"Had Sir William a man-at-arms, who served as his servant? For I shall make my man-at-arms, who has gone through many adventures with me, has fought by my side, and saved my life, my second squire.\" \"Yes, a very good and trusty fellow.\" \"Then of course I shall keep him on. Now, will you tell my man to come in? \"Roger,\" he said, \"You doubtless heard the earl\u0027s words, and I am now master of this tent, together with the armour, horses, and clothes of Sir William Baxter. Master Henry Pemberton will act as my squire, during the campaign. You will be my second squire.\" \"Well, master, I never looked so high as to become an esquire; and would rather remain a simple man-at-arms, were it not that it will keep me near you.\" \"You will find Roger a good comrade, Master Pemberton. He has been a man-at-arms at his own choice; for, as he can read and write as well as any clerk, he might have done better for himself.\" Pemberton looked, with some surprise, at Roger. He himself had not these accomplishments, and he was surprised at finding a man-at-arms so well endowed. \"As you may tell by his speech,\" Oswald went on, \"he is, like myself, a Northumbrian; and has done good service in the wars with the Scots.\" \"That I can well imagine,\" the squire said, with a smile. \"I would certainly wish for no stouter comrade.\" \"We must see about arms and armour for you, Roger,\" Oswald said. \"There will be no difficulty about that. None whatever, Sir Oswald. We have lost fully three hundred men, since we crossed the border, and a hundred and fifty since we came here, four days since. There is a pile of harness and arms, lying by the roadside; and there, methinks, it is likely it will lie. You have but to go with him, when you have attired yourself and buckled on spurs, and you can pick and choose among it. Assuredly, no one will gainsay you.\" Oswald now changed his attire. The clothes were handsome, and fitted him well. Then he buckled on the golden spurs, put on the knightly armour--for he had observed that the earl, and the knights that he had seen in the camp, all kept on full armour, being ever in expectation of sudden attack. \"Truly you make a handsome figure, Sir Oswald,\" said Roger, who had been assisting him. \"Little did I think, when I used to rail at you at your books, that you would grow into so stalwart a man; and that I should follow you in the field, as your squire. Your armour fits you as if made for you, save that these cuishes scarce meet your body armour. In truth, though bad for him, it was lucky for you that the master of this tent came to his death when he did.\" \"I like a steel cap better than this helmet, though I say not that it looks so well.\" \"Not by a long way,\" Roger said. \"Nought could become you better. What cognizance do you mean to take?\" \"I have not thought about it, yet. There will be time enough for that, after the war is over.\" \"Well, at any rate, master, I will today set about getting Sir William Baxter\u0027s off the shield. Methinks that, with some sand from the river bed, I shall be able to manage it with an hour\u0027s rubbing.\" \"Now, come along, Roger. There is no time to be lost, for I dine at midday with the Earl of Talbot. Master Pemberton will show us where the armour is lying.\" There was, indeed, a large pile. Oswald then said, \"As you are known, Master Pemberton, you had better stop here; for it will take some picking before Roger is suited. As it is but two minutes to twelve, I must hurry back to Lord Talbot\u0027s tent.\" Some seven or eight knights were already there.
