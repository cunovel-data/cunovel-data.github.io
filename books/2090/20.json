{"id":89972,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"\"Uh-oh,\" I murmured, staring at the empty grass where a body used to be. The ground was still dark with blood. Otherwise I might have thought we were in the middle of a shared delusion, and there\u0027d never been any dead sheriff at all. \"Where? What?\" Nic drew his gun and turned in a slow circle, eyes searching the forest. \"Who?\" \"There\u0027s no one,\" I said. \"But - \" He stalked around the body, took a few steps into the woods. \"There aren\u0027t any drag marks. I didn\u0027t hear anything.\" He was still thinking in human terms. I could hardly blame him. \"That\u0027s because no one dragged him away.\" \"They had to - \" \"No, they didn\u0027t.\" My insistence finally penetrated his confusion. He put away his gun. \"What happened?\" \"I have no idea, but I\u0027m thinking supernatural. Can I use your phone?\" He stared at the empty space as if the body might appear as miraculously as it had disappeared. No such luck. \"Nic?\" I pressed. \"The phone?\" He handed it to me, then went back to staring. I dialed Edward, got voice mail, left a message. \"Call me at - \" I frowned, then snapped my fingers in front of Nic\u0027s nose. \"Number?\" He recited it and I did the same, then called Jessie and relayed the news. \"Guess that explains where the dead bodies have gone,\" she said. \"Where?\" Silence met my question. \"Well, maybe it doesn\u0027t explain it, but - Hell, I don\u0027t know.\" \"Are you coming back?\" I asked. \"Can\u0027t. According to the authorities I\u0027ve talked to in Minnesota, they\u0027ve got a major wolf problem only we can solve, if you get my drift.\" \"Leigh and Damien?\" \"Serious shit going on in Washington, too. They\u0027ve got their hands full. I\u0027d swear there was a full moon.\" I glanced at the sky where the silver orb wavered, appearing slightly off balance, not at all full. Weird. \"Did you call Edward?\" she asked. \"Voice mail.\" \"Figures.\" \"What should I do?\" \"Deal with it. You\u0027re a J��ger-Sucher.\" \"Not really. I\u0027ve never had to handle a case.\" \"You do now. Just wing it.\" \"I\u0027m not the winging-it type.\" \"Change.\" Jessie hung up. \"Hell,\" I muttered. \"What did she say?\" \"Wing it?\" \"Hell,\" Nic repeated. \"Yeah.\" \"I\u0027d better contact the ME,\" Nic said, \"tell him to call off the coroner\u0027s wagon. Although how I\u0027m going to explain a missing body I have no idea.\" I handed Nic his phone, then stared at the blood-drenched ground. I hadn\u0027t a clue where to start. A few minutes later, Nic joined me. \"What did you tell him?\" I asked. \"The truth.\" \"What!\" \"Not the whole truth. Take a breath.\" Nic shook his head. \"I said the body was missing. Since that appears to be an epidemic around here, the doctor wasn\u0027t surprised.\" Silence settled over the clearing, broken only by the sounds of the night. \"I guess you can go,\" I said. \"Nothing natural here.\" \"No.\" I glanced at him in surprise. \"Why would you stay?\" \"I don\u0027t leave the scene of a murder, even if the body does. That\u0027s not how we do things in the FBI.\" \"You come across a lot of disappearing bodies in the FBI, do you?\" \"That\u0027s beside the point.\" \"You can\u0027t tell them what\u0027s going on here.\" \"No shit. I\u0027d be on the next transport to a little white room.\" In truth, I wanted Nic to stay. I had no idea what to do. Not that he\u0027d know any better how to figure out why a body - or ten - had disappeared into thin air. But at least he was someone who had dealt with death before. Still, there were other issues we had to get straight before we could work together. \"We can\u0027t - \" \"Sleep together anymore?\" he snapped. \"I figured that out for myself, Elise.\" \"I was going to say \u0027keep sniping at each other,\u0027 but that, too.\" There was no way I would continue an affair with a man who found me disgusting - especially when I still loved him. I might be pathetic, but I wasn\u0027t stupid. \"Fine.\" His jaw tightened. \"We\u0027ll work together.\" I held out my hand. \"But nothing else.\" He stared at my palm for several seconds, then spun on his heel and headed into the trees. \"I\u0027ll take that as a yes,\" I shouted at his retreating back. The ride back to Fairhaven was silent. We reached town about 3 a.m. \"Looks like the deputy\u0027s back,\" Nic murmured, eyes on the sheriff\u0027s office, where every light blazed. \"Guess we should tell him he\u0027s been promoted,\" I said. \"Mmm. He\u0027s not going to be happy.\" \"Why not?\" I let my gaze wander over the quiet, peaceful street. \"Fairhaven seems a decent place to be a sheriff.\" \"It was.\" \"He\u0027s a cop. He\u0027ll do his job.\" \"I don\u0027t doubt he will. But small towns usually hire retired law-enforcement officers - old men who don\u0027t want any more hassles.\" \"Oh,\" I muttered, understanding why Basil might not be thrilled to learn of his sudden promotion to head cop of a town with serious troubles. Nic stopped the car, shut off the motor. \"I don\u0027t think we\u0027re supposed to actually tell him what\u0027s going on,\" I returned. \"We don\u0027t know what\u0027s going on.\" \"Then there shouldn\u0027t be any problem. But werewolves, disappearing bodies. Let\u0027s just keep that to ourselves, shall we?\" \"What if we just tell him what we know? As little as that is.\" \"Rule number one,\" I recited. \"No truth for civilians. They panic, then they call the press. The National Enquirer would be a real pain right now.\" \"I suppose.\" I got out of the car. Nic followed and together we climbed the steps to the sheriff\u0027s office. \"But I don\u0027t like keeping law-enforcement officials in the dark. This guy should know what he\u0027s facing.\" I reached for the door just as it opened, and I nearly fell into the man on the other side. He wasn\u0027t old. Though at least twenty-one, since he was a deputy, Basil Moore appeared much younger. His long, wheat-shaded hair was tied in a ponytail. His cheekbones were high and sharp, his eyes bright green. He could have been a model, except for the scar that bisected his right cheek. What a waste. Then again, the scar gave him the air of a pirate in a modern world. The perfection\u0027s marring only seemed to highlight how perfect he was. \"Deputy.\" I straightened. \"I\u0027m Elise Hanover. This is Dominic Franklin.\" \"FBI,\" Nic said, offering his hand, and in doing so, including me as one of them. I let it pass. If Basil thought I was FBI, that saved a lot of questions as to what I actually was. \"More FBI?\" Basil asked, shaking Nic\u0027s hand, then nodding to me. \"More?\" Nic asked. \"That tall gal and the Injun.\" His lip curled. \"Too damned friendly, if ya ask me. What the hell\u0027s she thinking?\" I recalled Will\u0027s description of Basil - not an Indian lover. I\u0027d heard people like him existed, but I hadn\u0027t really believed it. Basil kept on talking in a striking bass voice that would have been lovely if he hadn\u0027t been such a racist. \"They were FBI, too. Why on earth the government would hire a red man, I have no idea.\" Nic glared at me and I shrugged. I wasn\u0027t surprised Jessie and Will and probably Edward, too, had identified themselves as FBI. We lied all the time so we could do our jobs with the least amount of questions asked. Besides, our usual lies - we were with the DNR, there was rabies, and so on - wouldn\u0027t work in Fairhaven. There weren\u0027t any wolves. \"Yes, well - \" Nic cleared his throat. \"Will and Jessie found Sheriff Stephenson.\" \"I\u0027d hope so since I told them exactly where he was.\" \"You didn\u0027t tell them he\u0027d be dead.\" Basil blinked. \"Dead?\" \"As in \u0027not alive,\u0027\" I offered. Nic threw me a quelling stare, and I shut my mouth. \"I guess that makes you the acting sheriff,\" Nic continued. \"Where have you been? I\u0027ve been calling since the body was discovered.\" \"I was talkin\u0027 to some folks around town. They\u0027re upset. People disappear, and they start whisperin\u0027 about black magic, Devil worship, witches.\" Basil\u0027s eyes narrowed. \"You think something like that is going on in Fairhaven?\" \"Nothing like that,\" I muttered. \"Should I grab Dr. Watchry and head to the crime scene?\" Basil asked. \"The doctor\u0027s been there already. He examined the body. Before - \" Nic broke off and Basil sighed. \"Gone again?\" \"I\u0027m afraid so.\" \"Don\u0027t suppose anyone saw who stole it this time.\" \"One minute it was there,\" I said, \"the next, poof.\" Nic lifted a brow in my direction. I ignored him. People hear what they want to hear, and Basil was no different. \"I wish I knew who this crazy was, and how he managed to steal bodies with no one seein\u0027 him.\" \"Mmm,\" I agreed. \"What was Sheriff Stephenson doing out there?\" Nic asked. \"Report of a grave desecration. Happens sometimes, here and around. Usually kids.\" \"Has it been happening a lot lately?\" \"No more than usual.\" \"And what\u0027s usual for something like that?\" \"Now and again. Few times a year maybe.\" \"Hmm,\" Nic muttered. I understood his concern. Anything odd, especially anything odd that had to do with the dead, was cause for inquiry - both in his world and mine. \"I didn\u0027t see any graves. Did you?\" Nic asked. I shook my head. \"There are graves all over the woods,\" Basil said. \"Folks buried their dead wherever they dropped in the old days.\" \"That\u0027s true,\" I agreed. \"And this grave?\" Nic pressed. \"Whose was it? Who called and said it had been disturbed?\" Basil shrugged. \"I didn\u0027t take the call, but from the location I\u0027d say that was the Anderson homestead. You\u0027d have to look at the plot maps to be sure.\" \"I\u0027d also like to see the paperwork,\" Nic said. \"Paperwork?\" \"On the grave desecrations. Just point me in the right direction.\" \"I can\u0027t think that there\u0027s paperwork on something so simple.\" I understood Basil\u0027s confusion. Though murders were rare, mischief was not. Bored kids did a lot of drinking in the woods, at the end of dead-end roads, on dusty trails, then they got into trouble. Until recently, a little grave-digging was probably the most excitement anyone got in Fairhaven. \"I suppose this means you Feds are going to be taking over the case,\" Basil murmured. Nic and I glanced at each other. \"Yes,\" I said. \"That\u0027s exactly what it means.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-dark-moon-nightcreature-3/page-20.html","bookId":2090,"book":{"id":2090,"title":"Night Creature: Dark Moon (Nightcreature #3)","description":"Storyline: Dark Moon(Night Creature series book 3) Elise Hanover feels the pull of the moon--even in its dark phase.
