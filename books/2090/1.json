{"id":89953,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"I have always loved the dark of the moon, when the night is still and serene, when all that can be seen are the stars. There are those who term the dark moon a new moon, but there is nothing new about the moon. It has been here from time forgotten and will be here long after we are dead. I spend my days, and most of my nights, inside a stone fortress in the wilds of Montana. I\u0027m a doctor by trade, though not the kind who gives out lollipops after dispensing vaccines and pills. Instead I mix a little of this and a little of that, over and over again. My degree reads \"virologist.\" In English, that means I have a Ph.D. in the study of viruses. Don\u0027t worry, I won\u0027t let the excitement kill me. The boredom might, though, if the loneliness doesn\u0027t do it first. Of course, I\u0027m not completely alone. There\u0027s a guard at the door and my test subjects, but none of them are great conversationalists. Lately I\u0027ve started to feel watched, which is pretty funny considering I\u0027m the one in charge of the surveillance cameras. Paranoia is one of the first signs of dementia; except I don\u0027t feel crazy. Does anyone? I\u0027ve come to the conclusion I need to get out more. But where would I go? Most days I don\u0027t mind being locked tight inside the safest place in the West. The world is pretty scary. Scarier than most people realize. You think the monsters aren\u0027t real? That they\u0027re merely the figment of childish imaginations or delusional psychosis? You\u0027re wrong. There are things walking the earth worse than anything in Grimm\u0027s Fairy Tales. Unsolved Mysteries would have a stroke if they got a look at my X-files. But since lycanthropy is a virus, werewolves are my specialty. I\u0027ve devoted my life to finding a cure. I have a personal interest. You see, I\u0027m one of them. The powers that be say a life is formed by changes - decisions made, roads not taken, people we\u0027ve left behind. I\u0027m inclined to agree. On the day my whole world changed - again - a single decision, that fork in the road and the one I left behind walked into my office without warning. I was at my desk updating files, when the scuff of a shoe against concrete made me glance up. The man in the doorway made my heart go ba-boom. He always had. \"Nic,\" I murmured, and in my voice I heard more than I wanted to. The strong nose, full lips, wide forehead were as I remembered. But the lines around his mouth and eyes, the darker shade of his skin, hinted at a life spent exposed to the elements. The flicker of silver in his short hair was as shocking as him being here in first place. He didn\u0027t smile, didn\u0027t return my greeting. I couldn\u0027t blame him. I\u0027d professed love, then disappeared. I hadn\u0027t spoken to him since. Seven years. How had he found me? And why? Concern replaced curiosity, and my hand inched toward the drawer where I kept my gun. The guard hadn\u0027t called to clear a visitor, so I should shoot first, ask questions later. In my world, an enemy could lurk behind every face. But I\u0027d always had a tough time shooting people. One of the many reasons the boss kept me isolated in the forest. I\u0027d learned long ago how to gauge a suit for a shoulder holster. Nic had one. A disturbing change in a man who\u0027d once been both studious and dreamy, in love with the law and me, not necessarily in that order. Why was he carrying a gun? Since he hadn\u0027t drawn his, I drew mine, then pointed the weapon at Nic\u0027s chest. Loaded with silver, I was ready for anything. Except the punch of his deep blue eyes and the familiar timbre of his voice. \"Hey, sweetheart.\" In college that endearment had made me all warm and stupid. I\u0027d promised things I had no right to promise. Now the same word, uttered with cool sarcasm, annoyed me. I\u0027d left for his own good. However, he didn\u0027t know that. I got to my feet, stepped around the desk, came a little too close. \"What are you doing here?\" \"I didn\u0027t think you\u0027d be thrilled to see me, but this isn\u0027t exactly the welcome I expected.\" His gaze lowered to the gun, and I was distracted by the scent of him. Fresh snow, mountain air, my past. He grabbed the weapon, twisted it away, then tucked me against his body with an elbow across my throat. I was no good with firearms. Never had been. I choked, and Nic released the stranglehold on my windpipe, though he didn\u0027t release me. Out of the corner of my eye I caught a glimpse of metal on the desk. He\u0027d put my gun aside. One less thing to worry about. \"What do you want?\" I managed. Instead of answering, he nuzzled my hair and his breath brushed my ear. My knees quivered; my eyes burned. Having Nic so close was making me remember things I\u0027d spent years trying to forget. And the memories hurt. Hell, I still loved him. An uncommon rush of emotion caused my muscles to clench, my stomach to roil. I wasn\u0027t used to feeling anything. I prided myself on being cool, patrician, in charge: Dr. Elise Hanover, ice queen. When I let my anger loose, bad things happened. But no one had ever affected me like Nic. No one had ever made me as happy or as sad. No one could make me more furious. I slammed my spike heel onto his shiny black shoe and ground down with all my weight. Nic flinched, and I jabbed my elbow into his stomach. I forgot to pull my punch, and he flew into the wall. Spinning around, I watched him slide to the floor, eyes closed. Oops. I resisted the urge to run to him, touch his face, kiss his brow. For both our sakes, we couldn\u0027t go back to the way things had been. Nic\u0027s eyelids fluttered, and he mumbled something foul. I let out the breath I\u0027d been holding. He\u0027d be all right. I doubted he was often on the losing end of a fight. Since I\u0027d seen him last he\u0027d bulked up - the combination of age and a few thousand hours with a weight machine. What else had he been doing in the years we\u0027d been apart? He\u0027d planned to become a lawyer, except he didn\u0027t resemble any lawyer I\u0027d ever seen. The suit, yes, but beneath the crisp charcoal material he was something more than a paper-pushing fast talker. Perhaps a soldier decked out in his Sunday best. My gaze wandered over him, catching on the dark sunglasses hooked into his pocket. Suit. Muscles. Men in Black glasses. \"FBI,\" I muttered. Now I was really ticked off. Nic\u0027s eyes snapped open, crossing once before focusing on my face. \"You always were smarter than you looked.\" I\u0027d been the victim of enough dumb-blonde jokes to last me several lifetimes. The moronic jabs and riddles had bothered me, until I realized I could use the speaker\u0027s attitude to my advantage. If people thought I was stupid, they weren\u0027t expecting anything else. So I didn\u0027t rise to Nic\u0027s bait. He\u0027d been sent here by the big boys, without warning, and that meant trouble. \"I suppose you want me to hand over my gun?\" he grumbled. I shrugged. \"Keep it.\" A weapon filled with lead was the least of my worries. He struggled to his feet, and I experienced an instant of concern when he wobbled. I\u0027d hit him way too hard. \"Let me give you some advice,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve always found that the people we least expect to shoot us usually do.\" Funny, I\u0027d found that, too. \"What are you doing here?\" I demanded. His brows lifted. \"No hugs, no kisses? You aren\u0027t glad to see me? If I remember correctly I should be the one who\u0027s angry.\" He sat on a chair without being invited. \"Oh, wait.\" His eyes met mine. \"I am.\" Nic had every reason to be furious. I\u0027d snuck out in the night as if I had something to hide. Oh, wait. I did. Nevertheless, being near him hurt. I couldn\u0027t tell Nic why I\u0027d left. I couldn\u0027t apologize, because I wasn\u0027t really sorry. I couldn\u0027t touch him the way I wanted to. I couldn\u0027t ever touch anyone that way. \"You didn\u0027t come here to talk about our past,\" I snapped. \"What does the FBI want with the J��ger-Suchers?\" I wasn\u0027t the only one fighting monsters. I was merely the geeky member of a select group - \"hunter-searchers\" for those a little rusty on their German. Though financed by the government, the J��ger-Suchers were a secret from all but those who needed to know. If it got out that there were monsters running all over the place, people would panic. Not only that, but heads would roll. Unlimited cash for a Special Forces monster-hunting unit? Someone would definitely lose their job, and we\u0027d lose our funding. So we pretended to be things we weren\u0027t. For instance, I was a research scientist investigating a new form of rabies in the animal population. Most of our field agents carried documentation identifying them as wardens for various natural resource departments. Until today, the precautions had worked. No one had ever come snooping before. The question was: Why now? And why him?","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-dark-moon-nightcreature-3/page-1.html","bookId":2090,"book":{"id":2090,"title":"Night Creature: Dark Moon (Nightcreature #3)","description":"Storyline: Dark Moon(Night Creature series book 3) Elise Hanover feels the pull of the moon--even in its dark phase.
