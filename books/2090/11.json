{"id":89963,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"\"Relax,\" I ordered before Jessie and Leigh could threaten me again. \"I\u0027m not going to flip out and start eating the populace.\"\\n\\n At least for another few days.\\n\\n \"You can make more,\" Damien pressed. \"Can\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"Sure.\"\\n\\n As soon as Edward handed over the formula.\\n\\n I\u0027d planned to send Damien some of the serum before the next full moon. The item had been on my to-do list. Along with a whole bunch of other things I couldn\u0027t quite remember.\\n\\n I stood and crossed to the window, peering at the second floor of the antiques store. A light was on inside, but no shadows moved beyond the curtains.\\n\\n \"Maybe I should see if they\u0027re okay.\"\\n\\n \"Why wouldn\u0027t they be?\"\\n\\n I turned at Jessie\u0027s words. \"You\u0027ve never told me why you came to Fairhaven.\"\\n\\n The four of them exchanged glances. I was getting really sick of being on the outside looking in. I should have been used to it by now, but I wasn\u0027t.\\n\\n \"What?\" I demanded.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re not exactly sure,\" Damien said.\\n\\n Leigh shushed him, and I shot her a glare. \"If the compound wasn\u0027t toast, you\u0027d be sending me a report.\\n\\n You never had a problem with that before.\"\\n\\n \"Before, you weren\u0027t one of them.\"\\n\\n \"I was. You just didn\u0027t know it.\"\\n\\n Leigh\u0027s fingers curled into fists. \"I can\u0027t believe you let your hair down and run naked in the woods once a month.\"\\n\\n \"It isn\u0027t as if I have a choice.\" I didn\u0027t want to talk about my affliction - with her or anyone else. \"Can we move on? What\u0027s happening here?\"\\n\\n Silence reigned for several ticks of the clock before Will spread his hands. \"People are disappearing.\"\\n\\n I wanted to say \"Same old, same old,\" but that wouldn\u0027t be helpful, would it?\\n\\n \"Who called Edward?\" I asked instead.\\n\\n \"The sheriff.\"\\n\\n \"Bodies in the woods? Mangled? Eaten?\"\\n\\n \"Not this time.\"\\n\\n \"What, then, this time?\"\\n\\n \"People go missing,\" Leigh chimed in. \"There\u0027s blood but no bodies.\"\\n\\n \"We thought the victims were shifting more quickly than usual,\" Will said. \"Maybe some new kind of spell.\"\\n\\n \"Instant werewolf.\" Jessie made the motions of a drum roll with her hands. \"Presto changeo.\"\\n\\n My hand went to the talisman in my pocket. Uh-oh. I opened my mouth to explain, and Will jumped in.\\n\\n \"But there hasn\u0027t been an increase in the wolf population to account for the vanishing citizens. Damien says there aren\u0027t any werewolves here at all, except for him.\"\\n\\n \"No werewolves?\" I glanced at Damien.\\n\\n He shook his head. \"No wolves of any kind.\"\\n\\n \"There are wolves all over this part of the state.\"\\n\\n \"Except in Fairhaven,\" he said.\\n\\n \"The only reason for no wolves in a place like this would be werewolves,\" I murmured. \"They don\u0027t like one another.\"\\n\\n \"Exactly,\" Damien agreed. \"So what does it mean if there\u0027s neither one?\"\\n\\n I had no idea, but I doubted it meant anything good.\\n\\n \"No one\u0027s seen any wolves,\" Leigh continued, \"but the forest is full of crows.\"\\n\\n Crows and wolves work together in nature. Wolves tolerated the birds, even let them feed off their kills.\\n\\n In return, many naturalists believe crows fly ahead of the packs, leading them to prey. The behavior transfers to werewolves. Where there\u0027s a lot of one, there\u0027s a lot of the other.\\n\\n My own fascination with the large, black scavengers had begun in childhood. While many people used them for target practice, I\u0027d drawn pictures of crows over and over again. When I got older, I began to collect figurines, paintings, stuffed animals - like the one Nic had found on my desk. Heckle and Jeckle had been my favorite cartoon.\\n\\n No wonder Edward had kept such a close eye on me.\\n\\n \"When I\u0027m out in the woods,\" Damien murmured. \"I sense... I\u0027m not sure. It\u0027s as if something\u0027s coming, or maybe just left. I feel watched even when I\u0027m certain nothing\u0027s there.\"\\n\\n I\u0027d say he was paranoid, except I\u0027d felt something, too.\\n\\n \"What were you shooting at when I got here?\"\\n\\n \"Shadows,\" Jessie muttered. \"We\u0027re all spooked.\"\\n\\n Which wasn\u0027t like them. Werewolf hunters were the least spookable creatures on earth. They had to be.\\n\\n She saw my expression, must have read my mind. \"I can kill anything I see. But what am I supposed to do when I know it\u0027s there, but it isn\u0027t?\"\\n\\n I had no answer for that.\\n\\n \"Axe you sufficiently brought up to speed, Elise?\"\\n\\n Edward\u0027s voice from the doorway made me gasp and spin around. \"I hate when you sneak up on me.\"\\n\\n That he could was amazing in itself. I had the hearing of a wolf.\\n\\n I glanced past Edward, searching for Nic, my mind already scrambling for a way to explain our discussion of disappearing bodies. But my boss was alone, and that made me more nervous.\\n\\n \"What did you do with him?\"\\n\\n \"Who?\"\\n\\n \"You know damn well who!\"\\n\\n His eyes narrowed, and I swallowed the rest of the angry words that threatened to spill off my tongue.\\n\\n They\u0027d get me nowhere.\\n\\n \"Where is Agent Franklin, sir?\"\\n\\n \"Where do you think?\"\\n\\n My heart skipped, then lunged into my throat. \"You didn\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"That depends on what you think I did.\"\\n\\n \"You can\u0027t go around killing FBI agents.\"\\n\\n He frowned. \"Why would I do that?\"\\n\\n \"Because your answer to every problem is to shoot it?\"\\n\\n \"It has always worked well for me.\"\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t just stand around while Nic might be dead or dying. I started for the door, and Edward yanked me back. \"Relax. He is safe.\"\\n\\n He dropped my arm immediately, surreptitiously rubbing his fingers against his black pants. Though I\u0027d been expecting it, Edward\u0027s typical reaction to being anywhere near me hurt more than usual.\\n\\n The only man who had ever touched me gently, willingly, was Nic - and he didn\u0027t know what I was.\\n\\n Seeing him again made me long for what I didn\u0027t, and couldn\u0027t, have.\\n\\n \"By safe you mean - \"\\n\\n \"Alive,\" Edward snapped. \"I am not completely senile. Yet.\"\\n\\n \" Yet being the operative word,\" Jessie muttered.\\n\\n I tensed, anticipating an explosion of German obscenities. Instead, Edward smirked, winked, and the two of them chuckled. I stifled my childish jealousy. He would never care for me the way he cared for Jessie or Leigh, and I\u0027d better get used to it.\\n\\n Edward glanced at the Fitzgeralds. \"I thought I sent you two... elsewhere.\"\\n\\n \"We wanted to hear the story of why your second in command turns furry every month.\"\\n\\n The last flicker of humor fled his eyes as he glanced at me. \"You told them everything?\"\\n\\n Not everything. There were certain secrets only Edward and I could ever know.\\n\\n \"I told them the basics so they wouldn\u0027t shoot me.\"\\n\\n \"They were ordered to leave you alone.\" He fixed the others with a glare. \"Elise is beyond your reach.\\n\\n She answers only to me.\"\\n\\n \"La-di-dah,\" Jessie mumbled. \"There isn\u0027t a scratch on her.\"\\n\\n \"But not for lack of trying,\" Will countered, taking her hand when she would have slugged him.\\n\\n Edward scowled at Jessie, then Leigh. \"You are not to play games with Elise. No physical fighting, do you understand?\"\\n\\n A warm glow began in my chest. Edward was worried about me.\\n\\n \"She could kill you without even trying,\" he continued, and the glow died.\\n\\n He was worried about them. I should have known.\\n\\n \"Can I talk to you?\" Damien jerked his head. \"Outside?\"\\n\\n I looked at the others, but they were studiously avoiding my gaze. Except for Edward, who merely rolled his eyes and shrugged.\\n\\n \"Sure.\"\\n\\n Damien preceded me onto the porch, where he pondered the sky for several moments. I didn\u0027t press. I was just glad to get away from everyone else for a while.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s more to your story than you told them,\" he said at last.\\n\\n \"Isn\u0027t there always?\"\\n\\n Our eyes met and a flash of understanding, a tug of camaraderie, passed between us.\\n\\n \"What is Mandenauer to you?\" he asked.\\n\\n I was surprised by the question. \"My boss.\"\\n\\n Edward was the father I didn\u0027t have, the mother, too. Even if he didn\u0027t love me, more than likely hated me, he was the only constant I\u0027d ever had in my life.\\n\\n \"How close are you, really?\" he murmured.\\n\\n At first I thought he was asking again about me and Edward. Did everyone believe the old man and I were lovers? Hadn\u0027t they seen the way he treated me? Worse than a junior agent. Then I studied Damien\u0027s face and understood he meant something else entirely.\\n\\n \"To an antidote?\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t wait for his answer. This was why he\u0027d asked me outside. He didn\u0027t want Leigh to know if I was further away from a cure than they thought.\\n\\n \"I haven\u0027t discovered anything new,\" I admitted.\\n\\n Dismay filled his eyes, and I touched him before I thought not to. Power blazed - bright, blinding, painful.\\n\\n I snatched my hand away.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re going to have to watch that,\" I said. \"It hurts\"\\n\\n I\u0027d never touched any of my test subjects skin to skin. I couldn\u0027t afford to have them know what I was.\\n\\n But there\u0027d been other times, other places, where I had touched a werewolf in human form. They hadn\u0027t lived to see another moon, or blow my cover, but my secret was safe with Damien.\\n\\n \"I will find a cure,\" I promised. \"Count on it.\"\\n\\n \"I feel better knowing...\" His voice drifted off.\\n\\n \"That I have a personal interest?\"\\n\\n Damien nodded.\\n\\n No one could desire a cure more than me - not even Damien. Leigh loved him despite what he was. I didn\u0027t have that luxury. No one loved me, and while I was like this, no one would.\\n\\n \"I never doubted you weren\u0027t working as hard as you could,\" Damien said.\\n\\n \"But I did.\"\\n\\n Neither one of us jumped at the sound of Leigh\u0027s voice. I\u0027d heard her coming, and so had Damien. She wasn\u0027t as sneaky as Edward. Not yet.\\n\\n \"Leigh - \" Damien began.\\n\\n \"Let me talk.\" She moved onto the porch and stood between us. \"I never trusted you, Doctor, and now I know why. Werewolves murdered my family. I don\u0027t like them.\"\\n\\n \"Yet you\u0027re married to one.\"\\n\\n Her eyes flashed, and her fingers curled into fists. \"We can\u0027t help who we love.\"\\n\\n \"I know.\"\\n\\n Leigh cast me a quick glance, and her fingers relaxed. I understood her dilemma. She both loved Damien and hated his curse. She wanted him cured, needed him to be, and she had to depend on someone she distrusted to do it. Whoever said life was fair?\\n\\n \"She saved you, Leigh. Show a little gratitude.\"\\n\\n \"I thanked her. What do you want?\" Leigh tilted her head in my direction. \"A hug?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll pass.\"\\n\\n I\u0027d never been big on physical contact. Never knew when a simple touch, like Damien\u0027s, could give me a blistering headache.\\n\\n My gaze was drawn to the throbbing pulse at the base of Leigh\u0027s neck - or an intense desire for red meat.\\n\\n I might be able to control my craving for human blood through medication, but that didn\u0027t mean I wasn\u0027t blindsided by a longing for it at the oddest moments.\\n\\n Leigh didn\u0027t trust me? Hell, I didn\u0027t trust myself.\\n\\n \"Just so we\u0027re clear,\" she continued. \"I want you to quit dicking around and fix him. That\u0027s what you\u0027re paid for.\"\\n\\n \"Leigh - \" Damien sounded exasperated.\\n\\n \"I\u0027d get more done if you weren\u0027t bugging me,\" I interrupted. \"Don\u0027t you have someone to kill?\"\\n\\n \"Always.\"\\n\\n \"Have a nice trip.\"\\n\\n A modicum of respect flickered in her eyes before she took Damien\u0027s hand. \"We\u0027ll be in Washington.\"\\n\\n \"D.C.?\"\\n\\n Which reminded me of Nic. The Fury remained parked in front of the tavern. Where was he?\\n\\n \"Washington State,\" Leigh answered.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s there?\"\\n\\n \"Trees. Wolves. Dead people. There\u0027s been a significant increase in werewolf activity pretty much everywhere over the past few days. Edward\u0027s cell phone\u0027s ringing like crazy. Drove him bat shit when he couldn\u0027t get hold of you.\"\\n\\n \"Strange that there\u0027s so much action when the moon isn\u0027t even full,\" I murmured.\\n\\n \"They\u0027re up to something,\" Leigh said, \"but then, they always are.\"\\n\\n With a nod that passed for both agreement and good-bye, Leigh headed for the car, stopping at the bottom of the porch steps when Damien didn\u0027t follow.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll be right there,\" he said.\\n\\n With one more glare for me, Leigh climbed into the passenger seat.\\n\\n \"I was thinking,\" Damien continued. \"Maybe the werewolves are after more than Mandenauer. If they want you or the information you\u0027ve gathered, they\u0027ll be back as soon as they know blowing up the compound didn\u0027t do them any good.\"\\n\\n I considered the silver bullet that had nearly hit me in the head. \"I think they already know.\"\\n\\n \"Where\u0027s your research now?\"\\n\\n \"Edward has it.\"\\n\\n Damien shot a quick, concerned glance at the cabin.\\n\\n Hell.\\n\\n What if someone killed Edward before he could tell me where the information was? The thought sent a shiver from my head down to my toes.\\n\\n I was surprised they hadn\u0027t tried already, though Edward wasn\u0027t easy to eliminate, and the werewolves, despite their pack nature, weren\u0027t exactly organized. Unlike real wolves, they didn\u0027t take orders well.\\n\\n There was always a new alpha fighting to be in charge, if not of a certain pack, then the world.\\n\\n Thus far they\u0027d never joined together with any success. If they did, we might be in serious trouble.\\n\\n And wouldn\u0027t killing my boss, then putting an end to a cure for lycanthropy be a good way for an up-and-coming leader to gain everyone\u0027s loyalty?\\n\\n I didn\u0027t like the direction of my thoughts. I had to find Edward and quick.\\n\\n \"Be careful,\" Damien said.\\n\\n Instead of shaking his hand - we both knew what a mistake that would be - I murmured, \"You, too,\"\\n\\n before slipping into the house.\\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-dark-moon-nightcreature-3/page-11.html","bookId":2090,"book":{"id":2090,"title":"Night Creature: Dark Moon (Nightcreature #3)","description":"Storyline: Dark Moon(Night Creature series book 3) \\n Elise Hanover feels the pull of the moon--even in its dark phase.
