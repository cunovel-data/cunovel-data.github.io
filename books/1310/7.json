{"id":15329,"no":7,"title":"CHAPTER VII. THE LANDING PARTY.","content":"During that night run down the coast the Grampus was driven at full speed. The electric projector was fitted against the lunettes of the conning tower, and threw an eye of light far out over the dark water. It was the hope of those aboard the submarine that they would be able to overhaul and pass the schooner, North Star, which, presumably, was rushing on ahead of them to interfere in some manner with the work cut out for the Grampus. The schooner had about three hours’ start of the submarine, but the latter craft was keeping to the surface and traveling at such a speed that it was thought she would surely overtake the other boat before the mouth of the Izaral was reached. However, in this Bob and Jordan were disappointed. They passed one steamer, creeping up the coast, but not another craft did they see. “The North Star won’t be able to ascend the Izaral, anyhow,” commented Jordan. “If Fingal communicates with the revolutionists, he will have to send a small boat—and perhaps we can overhaul that boat before it reaches the headquarters of the insurgent force.” There was a certain amount of sleep for everybody aboard the Grampus, that night, but Bob Steele. Dick and Carl slept the first half of the night, and, after that, relieved Gaines and Clackett; Speake caught cat naps off and on; Jordan stretched himself out on top of the locker in the periscope room and took his forty winks with nothing to bother him; and Tirzal, when45 the submarine was in a fairly clear stretch of her course, was relieved by Bob and sent down to curl up on the floor and snore to his heart’s content. The tireless motor hummed the song familiar in Bob’s ears, and the excitement of the work in prospect kept him keyed to highest pitch in spite of his loss of rest. In the gray of early morning, an hour after Bob had turned off the electric projector, he sighted the mouth of a river with high, bluffy banks on each side. On one of the banks, peeping out from a covert of royal palms, was a small village. Directly across the stream from the village, commanding both the river and the small harbor in front of the town, was a rude fort. Bob called Tirzal. “She’s de ruvver, all right, you bet,” declared Tirzal, after taking a look at the periscope. “Stop um boat, boss,” he added. “We no want de people in de town to see um.” Bob halted the submarine with the touch of a push button. “We’d better submerge, Bob,” called Jordan. “That’s the way we’ve got to get up the river, and it’s our proper course for dodging around the town. Can you see anything of the schooner?” “There are only a few small native boats in the harbor,” answered Bob. “The schooner isn’t in sight.” “Beats the deuce what’s become of the boat,” growled the consul. “If she sent a launch up the river, the schooner ought to be somewhere around, waiting for the launch to get back.” “She may have pulled off down the coast just to keep clear of us. How’s the water in the river?” “Him planty deep to where we go, boss,” spoke up Tirzal. “Some time him t’irty feet, mos’ly fifty feet. Eberyt’ing go fine if we keep in de channel.” 46 “We’ll be on the safe side,” went on Bob, “and just swing along with the water over our decks and the top of the conning tower. Ten-foot submergence, Clackett,” he added through a speaking tube connecting with the tank room. “Aye, aye, sir,” came back the voice of Clackett. The hiss of escaping air as the water came into the tanks was heard, and Bob secured the hatch and came down the ladder. The hissing ceased suddenly. “We’re ten feet down, Bob,” reported Clackett through the tube. “Take the wheel, Tirzal!” said Bob. With head under the periscope hood and one hand on the wheel, Tirzal rang for slow speed ahead. Bob and Jordan likewise gave their attention to the periscope mirror and watched, with curious wonder, while the tropical river unfolded beneath their eyes like a moving picture. The Izaral was bank-full. As the Grampus rounded the northern bluff and swerved into the river channel, the high, steep banks, covered with dense foliage, resembled a narrow lane with a blank wall at its farther end. When the boat pushed into the stream, however, and fought the current for three or four hundred yards, the seemingly blank wall gave place to an abrupt turn. The submarine took the turn and entered upon another stretch of the lane. This part of the river was as perfect a solitude as though removed thousands of miles from human habitations. At a distance of perhaps two miles from the coast the high banks dwindled to low rises, and on each side was an unbroken forest; the banks were overflowed; the trees seemed to grow out of the water, their branches spreading across so as almost to shut out the47 light of the sun and were reflected in the water as in a mirror. Birds of gaudy plumage fluttered among the trees, and here and there, in a bayou, alligators could be seen stretching their torpid bodies in the black ooze. Tirzal kept his eyes glued to the periscope. The channel was crooked and dangerous, and a moment’s neglect might hurl the submarine into a muddy bank, causing trouble and delay, if not actual peril. For two or three miles farther, Tirzal kept the river channel. Finally they came close to a spot where a deep, narrow stream entered the Izaral on the right. Tirzal turned into this branch and, after ascending it for some fifty yards, had the propeller slowed until it just counteracted the current and held the Grampus stationary. “We got to de place, boss,” said Tirzal, lifting himself erect with a deep breath of relief. “Now we come to de top an’ tie de boat to a couple ob trees on de sho’.” “Where are the revolutionists?” asked Bob. “Dey a good way off, boss. We hab to take to de bank an’ go find um. I know de way. Here’s where de boats come. You see dat pitpan close by de bank? Him rebels’ boat.” “Do you suppose,” queried Bob, turning to the consul, “that the schooner sent word to the rebels by means of the pitpan?” Jordan shook his head perplexedly. “They wouldn’t do that. The pitpan is no more than a mahogany log, hollowed out, and would be a poor sort of craft to row against the current of the Izaral while it’s at the flood. I can’t understand why we don’t see or hear something connected with the schooner. Perhaps”—the consul’s face brightened—“Fingal and Cassidy are on the wrong track, after all.” 48 “You go to de top, boss,” put in Tirzal, “an’ me swim asho’ wid rope; den we warp um boat close to de bank.” As a preparation for his swim, the half-breed began to divest himself of his clothes. Bob gave the order to empty the ballast tanks by compressed air, and the Grampus rose to the surface to the tune of water splashing from the tanks. “A party will have to land for the purpose of reconnoitering the position of the rebels,” said Jordan. “I would suggest, Bob, that the landing party consist of myself, Tirzal, of course, and some other person who you think can be easily spared. A strong force will have to remain with the Grampus, for our situation is encompassed with dangers. Before we can plan our dash successfully, we shall have to know something of the lay of the land and the disposition of the force that is guarding Coleman.” “You are right,” returned Bob. “I ought to remain with the submarine——” “And get a little sleep,” cut in the consul. “You’ve been on duty all night and must rest so as to be ready for the sharp work when it comes.” “I’ll have Speake go with you and Tirzal,” said Bob. “How long will you be gone, Jordan?” “Not more than two or three hours at the outside.” By then the Grampus was at the surface, and Bob climbed the ladder and threw back the hatch. Gaining the dripping iron deck, he looked and listened. The thick forest lay on every side, and the silence was broken only by the flapping of wings, and the lazy splash of alligators in a near-by bayou. Tirzal, a rope around his waist, scrambled clear of the conning tower and slipped from the deck into the water. He swam swiftly and silently to the bank,49 pulled himself up, untied the end of the rope from about his waist, and passed it around a tree. Dick gained the deck, made the boat end of the rope fast to an iron ring in the bow, and watched while Tirzal lay back on the cable with all his strength and hauled the bow shoreward, a foot at a time. “The bank is steep,” announced Dick, “and we can, run the nose of the old craft right into solid ground.” “That will make it easier for Jordan and Speake to land,” said Bob. A few minutes of pulling on Tirzal’s part brought the point of the submarine’s bow against the bank. Speake had come up on deck with one of the rifles. A moment later Jordan followed him, with Carl trailing along in his wake. Jordan carried two rifles, one for himself and one for Tirzal, and also Tirzal’s bundle of clothes. “We’re taking all the rifles, Bob,” said Jordan, “but I have left my cartridge belt and six-shooters in the periscope room. If you should be attacked—which I hardly expect—your best defense will be to sink to the bottom of the river. We’ll be back in three hours. If we’re not, you’ll know something has gone wrong with us. But don’t fret about that. Tirzal knows the country, and he’ll steer us clear of trouble.” Speake and Jordan made their way to the point of the bow and sprang ashore. As soon as Tirzal had slipped into his clothes and grasped the rifle, the three comprising the landing party waved their hands to those on the deck of the boat and vanished into the forest. “Dose fellers vas going to haf all der fun,” grumbled Carl. “I don’t think anybody is going to have a monopoly of ‘fun,’ as you call it, Carl,” said Bob grimly. “You and Dick stay on deck and keep a sharp watch for50 rebels. I’m going to the periscope room to take a nap. In order to be on the safe side, Dick, you’d better let the Grampus slide back toward the middle of the stream. Leave the cable on the tree and pay it off from the bow of the boat.” “All right, Bob.” “Call me if anything happens,” said Bob, climbing into the conning tower. On reaching the periscope room, he signaled Gaines to stop the motor, and told him and Clackett that the submarine was moored, and that they could either sleep or go on deck, as they preferred. Then, thoroughly tired out by his long night vigil, he stretched himself on the locker and was soon sound asleep. How long he slept he did not know, but he was suddenly aroused by a pounding of feet on the steel deck, startled cries, and a tremendous splashing of water. Thinking that Dick and Carl, who had comprised the anchor watch, had been caught napping, and that the revolutionists were making an attack on the boat, he leaped up, caught the first weapon he could lay hold of, and darted for the iron ladder. The weapon happened to be an old harpoon belonging to Speake, who had once had a berth aboard a whaling ship. When Bob lifted his head above the rim of the conning-tower hatch, a strange scene met his eyes.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2782/77069.html","bookId":1310,"book":{"id":1310,"title":"Bob Steele In Strange Waters or, Aboard a Strange Craft","description":"简介： We are in St. Georges Bay, ten miles from the port of Belize, British Honduras.
