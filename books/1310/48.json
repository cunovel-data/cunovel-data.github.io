{"id":15370,"no":48,"title":"CHAPTER XLVIII. A DESPERATE RISK.","content":"“Did you know, Bob Steele,” asked the consul, by way of preface, “that Captain Nemo, junior, right there in Belize, had been approached by an agent of the Japanese government and offered two hundred thousand for something he’s selling to our government for just half that?” “No, sir,” answered Bob. “But I know the captain well enough to feel sure that he wouldn’t sell the Grampus to any other country but the United States, not if he was offered a million. He has invented a submarine that is better than any other craft of its kind that was ever launched, and the captain is patriotic enough to want his own country to reap the benefit.” “Exactly. Captain Nemo, junior, is a man after my own heart, by gad! Well, he refused the offer, and two days later he received a warning signed simply, ‘The Sons of the Rising Sun,’ saying that if he did not reconsider the Grampus would be sunk in the bottom of the ocean. How was that for audacity? But the captain thought it was all bluff—the Japs have learned a lot from us, my lads, and bluff is not the least of their acquirements. “The captain said nothing to you, Bob Steele, about this warning from the Sons of the Rising Sun. He treated it with silent contempt, well knowing that you would do everything possible to safeguard the submarine without any unnecessary talk from him. “Now, from what you lads have told me, we must change our minds about that warning being a bluff.302 If it was a bluff, then the Japs are trying to make good. But the Japanese government knows nothing about this. If the high boys among the Japs in Tokio knew, they would be the first ones to send a warship after these precious Sons of the Rising Sun. The Young Samurai are going it on their own hook; they’re going to help their beloved country whether the country wants them to or not. “The Grampus is a good thing. The Japs are able to tell a good thing when they see it, and that’s what makes the Sons of the Rising Sun so hungry either to buy the submarine or send her to the bottom in such a way that she can’t come up. They’re a lot of hotheads, that’s what they are, and they don’t care a picayune what happens to them just so they can get in some wild stroke that, in their overheated estimation, may benefit Nippon. “I don’t know as we can blame them. It hasn’t been so mighty long since they broke through their chrysalis of heathendom, and they are drunk with their success in their late unpleasantness with Russia—Russia, a country that has been our firm friend ever since the Pilgrims landed on Plymouth Rock. “Well, you have faced desperate risks, and you may be compelled to face more. I wish I could assure you that there were no more troubles in sight, but the Japs are a persistent race, and whenever young firebrands like these Sons of the Rising Sun get started at anything they never know when to let go. But,” and here the consul brought his fist emphatically down on the table, “I don’t think you can possibly meet any greater dangers than you have already met and successfully passed through. Bearing that in mind, I’d be willing to bet every dollar I’ve got that Bob Steele will make good, and deliver this old catamaran at Mare Island, right side up with care, and everybody303 smiling—except, of course, the Sons of the Rising Sun. I’ll back Young America against Young Japan any day. Catch my drift? That’s about all. Come in and eat with me—we have to eat, you know, no matter how hot it is. After dinner we’ll look after Mr. Tolo, and I’ll give Bob a letter to an agent who will supply him with gasoline, or any other old thing that happens to be necessary in order to make a submarine go. There won’t be any water in the gasoline, either. Come on, now, and let’s try and be cheerful. Heaven knows you boys have got enough ahead of you to make your hair stand on end like quills on the fretful porcupine, but what we’re not sure of hadn’t ought to trouble us.” Bob and Glennie had a good dinner, and after it was over the consul went with them to the Grampus and gave the craft a sizing. He was charmed with the boat, and all the useful odds and ends of machinery with which she was packed. Following that, he went to the prison chamber and surveyed Tolo as he lay bound and helpless on the floor. “You’re a nice young patriot, I must say!” exclaimed the consul, as he looked down on the quiet, uncomplaining Japanese, “but you met more than your match when you went up against Bob Steele. Where are the rest of your rascally outfit?” “I speak nothing, honorable sir,” replied Tolo, “not because of any disrespect for you, but out of regard for my dear Nippon.” The consul stared, and then he groaned. “High-handed outrage stalks the seas,” he muttered, “and this poor fool calls it love of country! Well, well! I wonder what Commodore Perry would say if he could hear that? The Japs are our great and good friends, all right, but we don’t count for much when304 there’s a little thing like a patent boat on the program. I’ll take care of you, my lad,” he added to Tolo. “You’ll stay in Para until the first United States warship comes along, and then you’ll travel to the States and give an account of yourself.” A few minutes later the consul left the boat, and, an hour after he was gone, police officers arrived and carried the misguided Tolo to the municipal bastile. That was the last Bob and his friends ever saw of him. Bob and Glennie refused a pressing invitation to stay all night at the consul’s palatial home. They explained to him that, in view of the vague dangers threatening them and the Grampus, they felt as though they ought to stay with the boat. Mr. Brigham commended their zeal, repeated his encouraging auguries for their ultimate success, and warned them again of dangers ahead. “Desperate risks are what you’re to take,” said he. “It may be that you have clipped the claws of the dragon, and that nothing more will be heard of the Sons of the Rising Sun. That’s the bright side of the picture, but please don’t look at it. In a case of this kind it is better to expect the worst; then, if better things come to you, they will be in the nature of a happy surprise.” On the second day of their stay in Para, Dick went ashore and got their supplies. It had been on the schedule that the Grampus was to put in at Rio, but Mr. Brigham advised the boys to give that port a wide berth. “Your itinerary,” he explained, “is probably known to these hotheaded Japs. The way to fool them is by dodging the itinerary and putting in at the places where you are not expected.” 305 “We’ll have to stop somewhere before we round the Horn,” said Bob; “and I believe we’ll call at——” “Don’t tell me!” protested the consul. “Don’t tell any one in Para, or even talk it over among yourselves until you are well away at sea. Then, when you speak the name of your next port of call, go down to the ocean bed and whisper it. Do you think I’m piling it on? Well, perhaps so, but I am only trying to let you understand how necessary it is to keep your own counsel. I’m mightily interested in you, and in your ultimate success, and what advice I give I give earnestly, and trust you will take it so. You’ll get around the Horn, all right, and you’ll get to Mare Island, and the Grampus will become part and parcel of our country’s navy, perhaps with Ensign Glennie in command. That’s a cinch, my lads; but what you’re to go through before you reach Frisco is a horse of another color. Don’t be overconfident. Remember what I say, and keep your eyes on the dark side of the picture. Good-by, and luck go with you.” On the morning of the third day after their arrival at Para the Grampus slipped down the river toward the open sea. She carried confident hearts and determined wills—and, in spite of the fact that all had their eyes on the “dark side of the picture,” there was plenty of hope and also of good cheer in the stout steel hull of the submarine. For Bob Steele was in command. He had brought the Grampus through many perils, and all had faith to believe that he could bring her through many more.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2782/77110.html","bookId":1310,"book":{"id":1310,"title":"Bob Steele In Strange Waters or, Aboard a Strange Craft","description":"简介： We are in St. Georges Bay, ten miles from the port of Belize, British Honduras.
