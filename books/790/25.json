{"id":25476,"no":25,"title":"CHAPTER XV","content":"Three times since that first fruitless summons to lunch had Aspasia come to the door of the attic. Twice, with the engaging practicality of her nature, she had carried up a little tray. She would fain minister to a mind diseased, with soup or with tea, knowing no better medicine. Each time, however, her gentle knocking, her coaxing representations through the keyhole, had produced not the least response. But the girl\u0027s ear had caught the rustling of papers within; and, satisfied that there was nothing worse than one of her aunt\u0027s moods to account for the persistently closed door and the silence, she had withdrawn with her offering, more irritated, perhaps, than anxious. \n \n Now, however, as she knocked and rattled at the handle and implored admittance, there was a double pressure of anxiety upon her; the demands of unexpected events without, and a new, deathlike stillness within. \n \n \"Oh, dear,\" cried Baby, \"what shall I do, what shall I do!\" \n \n She thought of summoning Major Bethune to her aid; but shrank, with the repugnance of some unformed womanly reticence. \n \n \"I must get in,\" she said to herself, desperately; and flung all her young vigour against the door. To her joy, the socket of the bolt yielded with unexpected ease. She fell almost headlong into the room, and then stood aghast. There lay Lady Gerardine, prone on the floor, among the strewn papers, the flickering candle by her side. \n \n For a second the girl\u0027s heart stopped beating. The next moment she could have cried aloud with joy. Rosamond had not even fainted; but, as she raised herself and Baby saw the face that was turned to her, the girl realised that here was hardly an occasion for thanksgiving; and her own lips, trembling upon a tremendous announcement, were struck silent. \n \n \"Oh, my poor darling!\" cried she, catching the stricken woman in her arms, \"what is it?\" \n \n With a moan, as of physical pain, Rosamond\u0027s head dropped on her niece\u0027s shoulder. \n \n \"You\u0027re cold, you\u0027re worn out,\" said the girl. \"Those dreadful letters, and this place like an ice-house! Aunt Rosamond, darling——\" She chafed the cold hands vigorously as she spoke. \"You must be starved, too. Oh, and I don\u0027t know how to tell you! Let me bring you down to your own room—there\u0027s tea waiting for you, and such a fire! Aunt Rosamond, you must rouse yourself. Here, I\u0027ll put these papers by.\" \n \n The one thing that could stir Rosamond from her torpor of misery was this. \n \n \"Don\u0027t touch them,\" she said. Her toneless voice seemed to come from depths far distant. She laid her wasted hands over the scattered sheets, drawing them together to her bosom; and then, on her knees, fell again into the former state of oblivion of all but her absorbing pain. \n \n Frenzied with impatience and the urgency for action, Baby now blurted out the news which the sight of Lady Gerardine\u0027s drawn countenance caused her to withhold: \n \n \"Runkle\u0027s come!\" \n \n The woman kneeling half turned her head. A change passed over her rigid countenance. \n \n \"Yes; Runkle\u0027s here,\" went on Baby, ruthlessly, raising her voice as if speaking to the deaf. \"Uncle Arthur is here; he has come over in a motor—a party of them. Aunt Rosamond, your husband is here.\" \n \n A long shudder shook the kneeling figure. It was as if life returned to its work; and, returning, trembled in nausea from the task before it. A deep sullen colour began to creep into Lady Gerardine\u0027s white cheek. She bent over the gaping box and dropped into it her armful of papers. Then she looked over her shoulder at Aspasia, and drew down the lid. \n \n \"My husband! ... My husband is dead,\" she said. \n \n The girl\u0027s blood ran cold. Had the hidden terror taken shape at last? The words were mad enough; yet it was the fierce light in Rosamond\u0027s eyes that seemed most to signal danger. \n \n But Aspasia was not timid, and she was not imaginative. And Lady Gerardine\u0027s next action, the cry which escaped her lips, at once pierced to every tender helpful instinct of the girl\u0027s heart, and banished the paralysing fear. \n \n \"Oh, Baby,\" cried she, springing to her feet and stretching out her arms in hopeless appeal, \"what have I done? What is to become of me?\" \n \n Once more Baby\u0027s arms were about her. Baby, great in the emergency, was pouring forth consolation, expostulation, counsel. \n \n \"Look here, Aunt Rosamond; it\u0027s really only for a little while; you\u0027ll have to show, you know, but they can\u0027t stay. Their blessed motor broke down, or something, and they ought to have been here hours ago. Now they can only stop for a cup of tea, if they are to get back to-night. You must just pull yourself together for half an hour—just half an hour, Aunt Rosamond! Leave me to manage. All you\u0027ve got to do is to smile a bit, and let Runkle do the talking. They want us all to go to Melbury Towers to-morrow, Major Bethune and everybody. That\u0027s what they\u0027ve come over for.\" \n \n Lady Gerardine put the girl from her roughly. \n \n \"I\u0027m not going there,\" she said. \n \n \"Of course not,\" said wise Baby, soothing. \"But we must put him off somehow. To-morrow you can be ill or something. Do, Aunt Rosamond, darling, be sensible. Don\u0027t make things harder. For Heaven\u0027s sake don\u0027t let us have a row—that would be worse than anything! I know you\u0027re not well enough to stand poor old Runkle just now; it\u0027s your dear nerves. But just for half an hour—for the sake of being free of him. Oh, Aunt, you used to be so patient! Come, they\u0027ll be in upon us in one minute. Luckily they\u0027ve all been busy over that machine, pulling its inside to pieces. Come to your room, now, and have your tea and tidy a bit. And I\u0027ll keep them at bay, till you are ready.\" \n \n She half dragged, half led Lady Gerardine to the warm shelter of her own room. She stood over her till the prescribed tea had been taken; then, hearing the Old Ancient House echo to the footsteps of its unexpected visitors, she announced her intention of running to look after them. \n \n \"I\u0027ve told Runkle already that you\u0027ve a beastly headache,\" she cried, with her cheerful mendacity. \"I won\u0027t let him up here, never fear; but I\u0027ll come and fetch you down, when I\u0027ve started them on Mary\u0027s scones. If you just do your hair a bit—Lord, there goes six o\u0027clock, they can\u0027t stay long, that\u0027s one blessing!\" \n \n Left to herself, with the stimulating comfort of the tea doing its work upon her weary frame, Lady Gerardine viewed her position with some return to calmness. This odious burden that she had laid upon herself, she must lift it awhile once more; and it should be for the last time. She who for years had played the hypocrite placidly would play it now again though the tempest raged within her. For the future she must have time. Before she could act, she must think. For this present sordid moment—the child was right—there must be no scandal; above all not here, in this sacred house of his, where even she, unworthy, had recognised the presence of the dead. \n \n She sat down before the mirror and shook her long hair loose. \n \n The sound of voices, of laughter, rose confusedly from the drawing-room below. She set her teeth as the well-known note of Sir Arthur\u0027s insistent bass distinguished itself from the others. How had she endured it for five years? \n \n Doors were slammed, and then, the light thud of Baby\u0027s footsteps scurrying hither and thither like a rabbit; her calls in the passage brought a vague smile to Lady Gerardine\u0027s lips. \n \n Up to a certain point only is the human organisation capable of pain. After that comes the respite of numbness. Rosamond was numbed now. Mind and heart alike refused to face the point of agony; only the most trivial thoughts could occupy her brain. Idly she pulled the comb through the warm gold of her hair; idly she weighed which would be the least effort to her weary limbs, that of twisting up those tresses herself or rising to ring the bell for Jani. \n \n Presently her eyes wandered to the portrait that hung just over her dressing-table. She shifted both candlesticks to one side to throw their light full upon it. \n \n Baby came in as upon the wings of a gust of wind. \n \n \"The most dreadful thing,\" she panted, in a flurried whisper; arrested herself in her canter across the room, and plunged back to shut the open door; \"my poor, poor darling: they\u0027re going to stay the night!\" \n \n Lady Gerardine flung apart the girl\u0027s arms as if the embrace strangled her. Their eyes met in the mirror. Then the woman shot a glauce round the room, a glance so desperate that the other, child as she was, could not but understand. \n \n \"Oh, you\u0027re safe—safe for the moment anyhow,\" she blurted out; \"I\u0027ve been lying like Old Nick. I said you\u0027d just taken a phenacetin, and that if you were disturbed now you wouldn\u0027t be fit to lift your head all the evening. But you\u0027ll have to come down to dinner; you can get bad again afterwards, can\u0027t you? Runkle\u0027s quite injured already. He\u0027s been having such a jolly time lately; he thinks it harder than ever on him that you should still be ill. And Lady Aspasia——\" \n \n \"Lady Aspasia,\" repeated the other, mechanically. \n \n \"Yes, that abominable woman with the ridiculous name, she\u0027s there! And Dr. Chatelard; you remember, the pudgy Frenchman? We\u0027ve got to house them all somewhere, and to feed them. It\u0027s desperate——\" \n \n Aspasia checked her speech; for Lady Gerardine had risen from her chair with an abrupt movement and stood staring blankly into the mirror. \n \n Poor Aspasia had had sufficient experience already of her aunt\u0027s moods, but this singular attitude affected the girl in so unpleasant a fashion that she felt as if she ought to shake the staring woman, pinch her, shout at her, do anything to call her out of this deadly torpor! \n \n \"Aunt Rosamond,\" she cried, raising her voice sharply in the hope of catching the wandering attention, \"I\u0027ve told Sarah about the rooms, and ordered fires to be lit; and I\u0027ve seen Mary about the dinner. The poor Old Ancient House, Runkle\u0027s crabbing it already like anything! But we\u0027ll show them it can be hospitable, won\u0027t we?\" \n \n \"Yes,\" said Rosamond, \"yes.\" The hectic colour deepened on her cheek. The widened unseeing pupil contracted with a flash of answering light. \"Baby, you\u0027re a good child. It shall give the right hospitality—his house.\" \n \n Aspasia drew a deep sigh of relief. \n \n \"Mary thinks she can have dinner in an hour,\" she said. \"Oh Lord, what a piece of business! And—and you\u0027ll come down, won\u0027t you?\" \n \n She rubbed her coaxing cheek against her aunt\u0027s shoulder. \n \n \"Yes. I\u0027ll come down.\" \n \n \"I\u0027ll dress you,\" said Baby, her light heart rising buoyantly under what seemed such clearing skies. She nodded. \"Oh, dear, I\u0027ve such a desperate lot of things to do! There\u0027s the wine.\" She slapped her forehead. \"I\u0027d forgotten the wine.\" And the door closed violently behind her tempestuous petticoat. As a companion to a neurasthenic patient Miss Cuningham no doubt had her weak points. \n \n * * * * * \n \n Rosamond sank slowly back in her chair; her hand fell inertly before her. \n \n When the girl returned after an hour\u0027s exceeding activity the elder woman\u0027s attitude had not altered by a fraction. But the exigency of time and social requirements left Aspasia no leisure now to linger over doubts and fears. Her own cheeks were pink from rapid ablutions; her crisp hair stood out more vigorously than ever after determined manipulation. She pealed a bell for Jani, and fell herself upon the golden mass covering Lady Gerardine\u0027s shoulders, her chattering tongue in full swing: \n \n \"Of course, the poor wretches are in their motor garments. (You never saw anything like Runkle in a pony skin and goggles. He\u0027s more motist than the chauffeur.) So I\u0027ve only just stuck on a blouse, you see. But I\u0027ve determined you shall be beautiful in a tea-gown. Lord, I\u0027d no idea Lady Aspasia was so tremendous! I want you simply to be beautiful!\" \n \n Deft hands twisted and coiled. \n \n \"It was Runkle, you know, who broke the motor: he insisted on driving and jammed them sideways in a gate. He\u0027s awfully pleased with himself. It\u0027s Lady Aspasia\u0027s motor. She calls Runkle, Arty: what do you think of that? Ah, here\u0027s Jani. Which shall it be—the white and gold? I love the white and gold, Aunt Rosamond.\" \n \n \"Black—black,\" said Rosamond. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1892/54598.html","bookId":790,"book":{"id":790,"title":"Rose of the World","description":"简介： It is our fate as a nation, head and heart of a world empire, that much of our manhood must pursue its career far away from home.
