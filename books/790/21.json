{"id":25472,"no":21,"title":"CHAPTER XI","content":"With hands clasped behind his back, head bent, absorbed in thought, the black fan of his beard spreading over the black broadcloth on his breast, the cross-folds of the turban startlingly exotic on top of the fluttering sable garments—the latter pathetically European in intention—an incongruous figure under these bare placid English fruit-trees, Muhammed Saif-u-din came full upon Raymond Bethune. \\n\\n \\n\\n The sodden grass of the long neglected road had swallowed the sound of their footsteps. For once the Pathan was shaken out of his oriental calm for a brief moment as, suddenly looking up, he found himself within a yard of the officer of Guides. \\n\\n \\n\\n The guest of the Old Ancient House had strolled out by himself to smoke a solitary meditative pipe in the wild avenue. Seeing Muhammed\u0027s flaming headgear, he had deliberately directed his steps towards him; for Bethune would not have been that self that India had made him, had he not felt instinctively lured into the company of the Eastern, all degenerate as he chose to consider him. Moreover, the personality of Sir Arthur\u0027s secretary baffled him, and Bethune resented being baffled. He fixed his eye keenly upon the Pathan, turned babu. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Your soul is in the East, Muhammed,\" said he, addressing him in his own tongue. \\n\\n \\n\\n The dark face opposite relaxed into a smile, the white teeth flashed, Muhammed made the supple Indian salaam. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nay, your honour, my soul is in great England,\" he said, and would have passed on. But the other arrested him somewhat peremptorily. Muhammed wheeled back and brought his hand to the edge of his turban with a gesture that betrayed the soldier, then drew himself up rigidly. \\n\\n \\n\\n Under Bethune\u0027s long scrutinising look the thin face fell into deep lines of gravity; the large dark eyes, somewhat restless as a rule in their brilliancy, gazed back straight and full. The Englishman\u0027s heart kindled as the unconquered spirit of the Pathan seemed to rear itself to meet the cold domination of the conquering race. There was nothing of revolt in the man\u0027s look, yet something untameable, he thought. And it pleased him hugely. His mind leaped back to his own \"devils of boys\" on the mountain sides—eagles and leopards of humanity, as compared with the domestic animals. He ran a loving glance over the Indian\u0027s muscular yet lithe proportions: built for strength—for endurance—for the strenuous side of life. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How comes it, O son of the Mountain,\" cried he, \"that you are not among the Emperor of India\u0027s warriors? How come you to bend those eyes over screed and parchment, to cramp that hand round the quill instead of the talwar?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The florid oriental language came oddly enough in stiff, abrupt British accents from the officer\u0027s tongue. The flowing guttural which replied was in marked contrast: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have heard it said,\" answered the secretary, without moving a muscle of his countenance, \"that the pen is mightier than the sword.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A sneer, aimed at the Lieutenant-Governor\u0027s literary production, trembled on Bethune\u0027s lips, but he prudently suppressed it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You cannot deceive me, friend,\" cried he, abruptly; then: \"You have flown with the birds of battle and heard the cannon roar, and thought the smell of the powder sweet.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Again the Pathan smiled; and Bethune, watching him, was stirred, he knew not why, as by a glimpse of something at once immeasurably fierce and immeasurably sad. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sir,\" said Muhammed, in slow deliberate English, \"I have seen many things; and no man knows where his fate leads him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, no doubt!\" said Bethune, laughing not very pleasantly. He was irritated with the fellow\u0027s impenetrability and his own inability to deal with it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And so fate has brought you to a wealthy master,\" said he, tauntingly; \"and you think that this scribbling business will prove worth your while. \u0027Tis certainly an odd job for a Pathan! ... I trust well paid?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I sought the post, sir,\" said Muhammed. \"My master, since he is to be called my master,\" a sudden fire leaped and died in his eyes, \"will no doubt pay me what he owes me. When I come into my own country again, it may be I shall have found it worth my while.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n To this the officer made no reply. After a second\u0027s pause, Muhammed lifted his hand to his brow once more and moved away on the noiseless turf. Bethune turned to watch the swing of the strange figure through the trees. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Greed for money, and wily determination to get to lucrative posts in life—ambition to play the European—or—what?\" No motive that his sober common sense could accept as a plausible alternative. Yes, his previous impression had been correct; nothing but a desire for self-advancement—nothing but greed and an Eastern cleverness to seek opportunities—animated that splendid bronze, after all! A disappointing specimen to one who loved the warrior race; a specimen of the westernised Eastern—degenerate leopard, with the spirit eliminated and the wiliness twice developed, according to the law of nature that so often strengthens one attribute by the elimination of another. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1892/54594.html","bookId":790,"book":{"id":790,"title":"Rose of the World","description":"简介： It is our fate as a nation, head and heart of a world empire, that much of our manhood must pursue its career far away from home.
