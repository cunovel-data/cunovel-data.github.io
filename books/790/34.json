{"id":25485,"no":34,"title":"CHAPTER III","content":"Monsieur Chatelard, compact in self-possession, precisely attired, as if he had not been called from slumber at the worst hour of the night by a sense of mortal emergency! And yet a very different Chatelard, either from the eager traveller or the genial raconteur and table companion they had known: this was Chatelard the physician—the world-renowned specialist. There was a weighty professional seriousness about him as he advanced into the room, fixing his spectacles with thumb and forefinger; an air of confident responsibility. He wasted not a second upon curiosity at the singular group by the bed, but sent his keen direct gaze straight to the patient. \"She\u0027s killed herself,\" was his first thought. \"Poison,\" he murmured aloud, and his gesture was enough to clear the bedside for his own approach. \"No,\" said a voice close to him. \"Not poison-shock.\" M. Chatelard looked up quickly, and immediately became aware of a stranger\u0027s presence. \"Monsieur?\" he exclaimed. He, too, had instantly concluded that the second man in the room must be Bethune. He was shaken into surprise. \"In the name of Heaven, who are you?\" \"I am her husband, whom she thought dead. I took her by surprise; she fainted.\" M. Chatelard formed his lips for a noiseless whistle. Affairs, at one bound, had complicated themselves with a vengeance. Incredibly interesting! ... But the emergency claimed him. He bent over the bed, and there was silence all through the room. Even Sir Arthur, recalled from his undignified attitude, was stilled; not so much indeed from the sense that a human life was trembling in the balance, but from the demands which the presence of a new witness made upon decorum. The doctor raised himself and held out his hand. \"A candle,\" he said briefly. It was given to him, and again the silence reigned. M. Chatelard, with deft and gentle touch, lifted the heavy eyelid, passed the flame before it, and peered for some seconds into the fixed pupil, abnormally dilated. Then he handed back the light. Harry English took it, and held it aloft while the doctor once more consulted pulse and heart. Muttering that he would never travel without his stethescope again, M. Chatelard laid his cropped head on the fair bosom. Again the seconds ticked by with nightmare slowness. The brown hand that held the candle was shaken with slight tremor. At last M. Chatelard straightened himself with the final air of one who pronounces a verdict. \"This is no mere syncope,\" he said. \"This is brain trouble. Shock, as you said, sir,\" with a grave inclination of his head towards Captain English. Old Mary, back from her errand, here proffered some brandy in a glass. \"What is that?\" cried the physician, sharply. \"Brandy,\" he said, sniffing. \"Heaven preserve us, \u0027tis well I am here! Above all things she must not be roused. Mon cher Monsieur,\" he went on, turning again to Harry English, \"here all our efforts must be to help nature, not to oppose her. Let all those lights be extinguished,\" he added authoritatively. \"We must have darkness and quiet. How come all these people in the room?\" He spoke with the doctor\u0027s immediate irritation at surroundings injurious to his patient. There are situations passing the endurance of human nature, especially when it is the human nature of a person of high political importance. Here was M. Chatelard actually addressing yonder infernal interloper as the leading person! \"I call you to witness, M. Chatelard,\" Sir Arthur cried excitedly, \"that this is some conspiracy that I by no means acknowledge——\" Old Mary interposed, subdued yet urgent. \"Oh, sir, it is indeed my master!\" \"Hush, Arty, come away now!\" whispered Lady Aspasia; and once more clasped his elbow with strong sensible hand. \"There will be plenty of time for all this by-and-by.\" \"Unless you want to kill her altogether, Sir Gerardine,\" said Dr. Chatelard, gravely, \"you will make no scenes here.\" Harry English stood sentinel by his wife\u0027s bed, disdaining speech. \"Unless you want to kill her,\" had said the doctor. As the words had been spoken Sir Arthur looked quickly at her whom he had called wife. \"Better she should die,\" thought he. The whole measure of his love for the woman in whose beauty he had gloried was in that mean thought. Better she should die, since her existence was no longer an honour but a shame to him, Sir Arthur. He had loved her as part of himself; no longer his, what was she to him? Nothing more than the amputated limb to its owner, a thing to hide out of sight with all speed, a thing to bury away. \"I beg of you again,\" resumed Dr. Chatelard, in tones of restrained impatience; \"I can have no one remain.\" A couple of servant girls, who stood huddled whispering in their corner, slid away one after the other. Lady Aspasia, by some moral force and a good deal of muscular pressure, succeeded in dragging the protesting Sir Arthur in their wake. The doctor looked at old Mary—she dropped her curtsey. \"I might be of use, sir.\" He considered her a second in silence. \"You may stay,\" he said. \"And I?\" said Aspasia, her pallid tear-stained face was thrust pleadingly forward. \"You will do better to go, my child,\" said the Frenchman, paternally. \"Doctor ... she will not die?\" \"Assuredly not this night at least,\" he replied, evasive yet consoling. From the door she flung back a piteous look at English, and once again his eyes answered her: \"She will not die.\" Harry English took the last unextinguished candle and laid it on the floor. Outside, the yellow grey dawn was breaking. \"I want hot bottles,\" ordered Dr. Chatelard of Mary; and when she had left the room, he turned to the strange man who had called himself Lady Gerardine\u0027s husband. \"You, too, sir,\" he said. \"You must leave us.\" Harry English started. For the first time, that evening, discomposure laid hold of him. \"I? ... but I cannot go. She will want me.\" \"My dear sir,\" said the other, his tone softening into compassion (here was one who loved as few love, or he knew not how to read countenances), \"this affair is very strange, but I, as doctor, am here to judge of nothing but the good of my patient. She has had a shock, and the shock has been caused by you. I repeat, all I can do here is to aid nature—nature demands repose. She is as one who has had concussion of the brain. That brain must rest. Call her back to thought, you may call her to death.\" \"I would sit in a corner of the room—she would not know.\" \"Ah,\" said the doctor, \"one never can tell. That is a fallacy I have long since seen through. So long as the soul is there, my dear sir, many things take place inside the body that we know naught of.\" Then Harry English submitted. He went forth with bent head.... He who had waited so long! lint, even as Aspasia had done, he halted to question: \"If she comes to consciousness?\" \"She will not come to consciousness, perhaps, for days.\" \"If she wants me——?\" \"My dear sir—immediately, of course.\" \"When she comes to consciousness, will she——\" \"Ah,\" interrupted the doctor, \"who knows? We may have brain trouble—an illness we will surely have.\" Then Harry English, who had so confidently said she would not die, looked at the other mutely inquiring yet further. \"Ah, my dear sir,\" said the Frenchman in his quick apprehension, and shrugged his shoulder. Then he added, compassionately, turning his head towards the bed: \"She is young.\" Harry English closed the door and sat down in the dark passage, cross-legged after the habit that had grown second nature, and there remained. Waiting. Suddenly he rose to his feet again; he had heard the handle of the door click. M. Chatelard stood on the threshold. \"The Indian woman,\" he whispered, \"she makes a noise. She must go.\" Jani, crouching in a hidden corner within, had set up a moaning. The sound of her wail caught Harry English\u0027s ear: a creeping chill passed over him; that Eastern lament that had nothing human in its note, but was as the despair of the animal that mourns without understanding, how familiar it was to his ear! So did the women there, over seas, wail only over death. He, who had held himself in such strength hitherto, was shaken to his soul. He could not form the words that rose to his lips. \"You know how to deal with these persons,\" pursued the Frenchman, absorbed in his thoughts, and in the dusk unable to read the other\u0027s countenance, \"I beg you to remove her at once. But, chut, chut, attention, please, not to disturb my patient!\" English drew his breath sharply. Had he been of those who weep, he might have burst into tears then. It is the instant of relief that catches the strong-fighting soul unawares. He clenched his hands till the nails ran into the palm, and followed the doctor on noiseless feet into the room. One glance at the bed! It was all in shadow; but even in the deliberate dimness there was evidence that a practised hand had already been at work. He could see that his wife had been settled among her pillows with care. The white of a bandage lay across her brow. A screen was set between the bed and the banked-up fire. Old Mary was seated in a high chair, within the glow, composed and watchful, the very picture of what a nurse should be. The light of the shaded candle illumined but one thing—the white hand that hung slightly over the edge of the bed; it scintillated back from the gems of the ring that guarded the narrow wedding circlet. His rings! M. Chatelard pulled him by the sleeve. Harry English turned sharply. He had told Sir Arthur \"that his place was not here,\" and must now realise in his turn that neither was his place here. There was bitterness and anger in his eyes as he bent over the ayah. She looked up at him, terror on her face. He pointed to the passage, and she crawled out, on hands and knees, whimpering to herself like a dog. Without another glance towards Rosamond, Harry retired also, and closed the door behind him. Old Mary followed him with her eyes, and folded her hands; her lips moved as if in prayer. * * * * * In the passage Jani dragged herself towards her old master, and clutching his ankles, laid her head upon his feet. \"Sahib!\" ... Harry looked down at her a moment, without speaking. So intense was the bitterness that welled up within him, even towards this poor wretch, that he was ashamed of it. Thus, when he spoke, it was with an added gentleness. \"Ah, Jani,\" he said, \"you knew me, here, from the beginning.\" ... This miserable pawn on the chess-board of life, had she not worked against him, how different all might now have been! Jani once more lifted her face. In the livid dawn it looked grey with fear. Then she was gone from him with a scarcely perceptible rustle, a whisper of soft garments, like some stealthy-winged thing of the night. Harry English sank back into his squatting attitude; to wait again. Never had fate so completely veiled her countenance from him. Years he had endured. He had clung tenaciously to life, had borne, at the moment of hope renewed, the cruellest and most insulting buffet that could strike a man, and still had fought, still had held to a determined purpose. Had it all been to this hour only?—false servant, failing friend, lost wife! No, not lost. So long as the faintest breath flickered between those silent smiling lips. * * * * * Harry English turned to God, with a great cry of his soul. It was no cry of supplication, but a call upon the Infinity. Because of Power, because of Justice, because of Goodness, she must not die.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1892/54607.html","bookId":790,"book":{"id":790,"title":"Rose of the World","description":"简介： It is our fate as a nation, head and heart of a world empire, that much of our manhood must pursue its career far away from home.
