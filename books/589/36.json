{"id":30718,"no":36,"title":"WHEN LION COULD FLY","content":"Lion, it is said, used once to fly, and at that time nothing could live before him. As he was unwilling that the bones of what he caught should be broken into pieces, he made a pair of White Crows watch the bones, leaving them behind at the kraal whilst he went a-hunting. But one day Great Frog came there, broke the bones in pieces, and said, \"Why can men and animals live no longer?\" And he added these words, \"When he comes, tell him that I live at yonder pool; if he wishes to see me, he must come there.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Lion, lying in wait (for game), wanted to fly up, but found he could not fly. Then he got angry, thinking that at the kraal something was wrong, and returned home. When he arrived he asked, \"What have you done that I cannot fly?\" Then they answered and said, \"Some one came here, broke the bones into pieces, and said, \u0027If he want me, he may look for me at yonder pool!\u0027\" Lion went, and arrived while Frog was sitting at the water\u0027s edge, and he tried to creep stealthily upon him. When he was about to get hold of him, Frog said, \"Ho!\" and, diving, went to the other side of the pool, and sat there. Lion pursued him; but as he could not catch him he returned home. \\n\\n \\n\\n From that day, it is said, Lion walked on his feet, and also began to creep upon (his game); and the White Crows became entirely dumb since the day that they said, \"Nothing can be said of that matter.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2348/65535.html","bookId":589,"book":{"id":589,"title":"South-African Folk-Tales","description":"简介： In presenting these stories, which are of deep interest and value to South Africans, I hope they may prove of some value to those Americans who have either an interest in animals or who appreciate the folklore of other countries....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2348","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM"}}
