{"id":30716,"no":34,"title":"LION AND BABOON","content":"Baboon, it is said, once worked bamboos, sitting on the edge of a precipice, and Lion stole upon him. Baboon, however, had fixed some round, glistening, eye-like plates on the back of his head. When, therefore, Lion crept upon him, he thought, when Baboon was looking at him, that he sat with his back towards him, and crept with all his might upon him. When, however, Baboon turned his back towards him, Lion thought that he was seen, and hid himself. Thus, when Baboon looked at him, he crept upon him.[4] When he was near him Baboon looked up, and Lion continued to creep upon him. Baboon said (aside), \"Whilst I am looking at him he steals upon me, whilst my hollow eyes are on him.\" When at last Lion sprung at him, he lay (quickly) down upon his face, and Lion jumped over him, falling down the precipice, and was dashed to pieces.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2348/65533.html","bookId":589,"book":{"id":589,"title":"South-African Folk-Tales","description":"简介： In presenting these stories, which are of deep interest and value to South Africans, I hope they may prove of some value to those Americans who have either an interest in animals or who appreciate the folklore of other countries....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2348","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM"}}
