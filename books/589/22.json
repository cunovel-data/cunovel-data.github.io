There came also Lion, and wished to go up. Jackal, therefore, asked his little daughter for a thong with which he could pull Lion up; and he began to pull him up; and when his face came near to the cooking-pot, he cut the thong in two, so that Lion tumbled down. Then Jackal upbraided his little daughter with these words: \"Why do you give me such an old thong?\" And he added, \"Give me a fresh thong.\" She gave him a new thong, and he pulled Lion up again, and[93] when his face came near the pot, which stood on the fire, he said, \"open your mouth.\" Then he put into his mouth a hot piece of quartz which had been boiled together with the fat, and the stone went down, burning his throat. Thus died Lion. \\n\\n \\n\\n There came also the ants running after the cow, and when Jackal saw them he fled. Then they beat the bride in her brookaross dress. Hyena, believing that it was Jackal, said: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You tawny rogue! have you not played at beating long enough? Have you no more loving game than this?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But when she had bitten a hole through the cowskin, she saw that they were other people; then she fled, falling here and there, yet made her escape. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2348/65521.html","bookId":589,"book":{"id":589,"title":"South-African Folk-Tales","description":"简介： In presenting these stories, which are of deep interest and value to South Africans, I hope they may prove of some value to those Americans who have either an interest in animals or who appreciate the folklore of other countries....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2348","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM"}}
