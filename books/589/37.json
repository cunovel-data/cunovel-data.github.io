{"id":30719,"no":37,"title":"LION WHO THOUGHT HIMSELF WISER THAN HIS MOTHER","content":"It is said that when Lion and Gurikhoisip (the Only man), together with Baboon, Buffalo, and other friends, were playing one day at a certain game, there was a thunderstorm and rain at Aroxaams. Lion and Gurikhoisip began to quarrel. \"I shall run to the rain-field,\" said Lion. Gurikhoisip said also, \"I shall run to the rain-field.\" As neither would concede this to the other, they separated (angrily). After they had parted, Lion went to tell his Mother those things which they had both said. \\n\\n \\n\\n His Mother said to him, \"My son! that Man whose head is in a line with his shoulders and breast, who has pinching weapons, who keeps white dogs, who goes about wearing the tuft of a tiger\u0027s tail, beware of him!\" Lion,[127] however, said, \"Why need I be on my guard against those whom I know?\" Lioness answered, \"My Son, take care of him who has pinching weapons!\" But Lion would not follow his Mother\u0027s advice, and the same morning, when it was still pitch dark, he went to Aroxaams, and laid himself in ambush. Gurikhoisip went also that morning to the same place. When he had arrived he let his dogs drink, and then bathe. After they had finished they wallowed. Then also Man drank; and, when he had done drinking, Lion came out of the bush. Dogs surrounded him as his Mother had foretold, and he was speared by Gurikhoisip. Just as he became aware that he was speared, the Dogs drew him down again. In this manner he grew faint. While he was in this state, Gurikhoisip said to the Dogs, \"Let him alone now, that he may go and be taught by his Mother.\" So the Dogs let him go. They left him, and went home as he lay there. The same night he walked towards home, but whilst he was on the way his strength failed him, and he lamented:[128] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mother! take me up! \\n\\n Grandmother! take me up! Oh me! Alas!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n At the dawn of day his Mother heard his wailing, and said— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My Son, this is the thing which I have told thee: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Beware of the one who has pinching weapons, \\n\\n Who wears a tuft of tiger\u0027s tail, \\n\\n Of him who has white dogs! \\n\\n Alas! thou son of her who is short-eared, \\n\\n Thou, my short-eared child! \\n\\n Son of her who eats raw flesh, \\n\\n Thou flesh-devourer; \\n\\n Son of her whose nostrils are red from the prey, \\n\\n Thou with blood-stained nostrils! \\n\\n Son of her who drinks pit-water, \\n\\n Thou water-drinker!\u0027\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2348/65536.html","bookId":589,"book":{"id":589,"title":"South-African Folk-Tales","description":"简介： In presenting these stories, which are of deep interest and value to South Africans, I hope they may prove of some value to those Americans who have either an interest in animals or who appreciate the folklore of other countries....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2348","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM"}}
