During this they did not move, but, remaining always in the same places, called each to the other, \"Are you there?\" and each one answered, \"I am here.\" The Ostriches hearing this, ran so tremendously that they quite exhausted their strength, and fell down. Then the Tortoises assembled by-and-by at the place where the Ostriches had fallen, and devoured them. \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2348/65531.html","bookId":589,"book":{"id":589,"title":"South-African Folk-Tales","description":"简介： In presenting these stories, which are of deep interest and value to South Africans, I hope they may prove of some value to those Americans who have either an interest in animals or who appreciate the folklore of other countries....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2348","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM"}}
