{"id":30712,"no":30,"title":"ELEPHANT AND TORTOISE","content":"Two powers, Elephant and Rain, had a dispute. Elephant said, \"If you say that you nourish me, in what way is it that you say so?\" Rain answered, \"If you say that I do not nourish you, when I go away, will you not die?\" And Rain then departed. \\n\\n \\n\\n Elephant said, \"Vulture! cast lots to make rain for me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Vulture said, \"I will not cast lots.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Then Elephant said to Crow, \"Cast lots!\" who answered, \"Give the things with which I may cast lots.\" Crow cast lots and rain fell. It rained at the lagoons, but they dried up, and only one lagoon remained. \\n\\n \\n\\n Elephant went a-hunting. There was, however, Tortoise, to whom Elephant said, \"Tortoise, remain at the water!\" Thus Tortoise was left behind when Elephant went a-hunting.[113] \\n\\n \\n\\n There came Giraffe, and said to Tortoise, \"Give me water!\" Tortoise answered, \"The water belongs to Elephant.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n There came Zebra, who said to Tortoise, \"Give me water!\" Tortoise answered, \"The water belongs to Elephant.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n There came Gemsbok, and said to Tortoise, \"Give me water!\" Tortoise answered, \"The water belongs to Elephant.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n There came Wildebeest, and said, \"Give me water!\" Tortoise said, \"The water belongs to Elephant.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n There came Roodebok, and said to Tortoise, \"Give me water!\" Tortoise answered, \"The water belongs to Elephant.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n There came Springbok, and said to Tortoise, \"Give me water!\" Tortoise said, \"The water belongs to Elephant.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n There came Jackal, and said to Tortoise, \"Give me water!\" Tortoise said, \"The water belongs to Elephant.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n There came Lion, and said, \"Little Tortoise, give me water!\" When little Tortoise was about to say something, Lion got hold of him and beat him; Lion drank of the water, and since then the animals drink water. \\n\\n \\n\\n When Elephant came back from the hunting, he said, \"Little Tortoise, is there water?\" Tortoise answered, \"The animals have drunk the water.\" Elephant asked, \"Little Tortoise, shall I chew you or swallow you down?\" Little Tortoise said, \"Swallow me, if you please!\" and Elephant swallowed him whole. \\n\\n \\n\\n After Elephant had swallowed Little Tortoise, and he had entered his body, he tore off his liver, heart, and kidneys. Elephant said, \"Little Tortoise, you kill me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n So Elephant died; but little Tortoise came out of his dead body, and went wherever he liked. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2348/65529.html","bookId":589,"book":{"id":589,"title":"South-African Folk-Tales","description":"简介： In presenting these stories, which are of deep interest and value to South Africans, I hope they may prove of some value to those Americans who have either an interest in animals or who appreciate the folklore of other countries....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2348","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:59 AM"}}
