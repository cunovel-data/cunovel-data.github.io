Giraffe said to Tortoise, \"At once I could trample you to death.\" Tortoise, being afraid, remained silent. Then Giraffe said, \"At once I could swallow you.\" Tortoise said, in answer to this, \"Well, I just belong to the family of those whom it has always been customary to swallow.\" Then Giraffe swallowed Tortoise; but when the latter was being gulped down, he stuck in Giraffe\u0027s throat, and as the latter could not get it down, he was choked to death. \\n\\n \\n\\n When Giraffe was dead, Tortoise crawled out and went to Crab (who is considered as the mother of Tortoise), and told her what had happened.
