{"id":2346,"no":65,"title":"Chapter 65","content":"1. The ancients who showed their skill in practising the Tao did so, not to enlighten the people, but rather to make them simple and ignorant.\n 2. The difficulty in governing the people arises from their having much knowledge. He who (tries to) govern a state by his wisdom is a scourge to it; while he who does not (try to) do so is a blessing.\n 3. He who knows these two things finds in them also his model and rule.
