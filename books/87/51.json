They receive their forms according to the nature of each, and are completed according to the circumstances of their condition. Therefore all things without exception honour the Tao, and exalt its outflowing operation.\n 2. This honouring of the Tao and exalting of its operation is not the result of any ordination, but always a spontaneous tribute.\n 3. Thus it is that the Tao produces (all things), nourishes them, brings them to their full growth, nurses them, completes them, matures them, maintains them, and overspreads them.\n 4. It produces them and makes no claim to the possession of them; it carries them through their processes and does not vaunt its ability in doing so; it brings them to maturity and exercises no control over them;--this is called its mysterious operation.\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/613/3561.html","bookId":87,"book":{"id":87,"title":"道德经 The Tao-te Ching","description":"简介： 《道德经》，又称《道德真经》《老子》《五千言》《老子五千文》，是中国古代先秦诸子分家前的一部著作，为其时诸子所共仰，传说是春秋时期的老子李耳（似是作者、注释者、传...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/120803/1-120P309250G22.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/613","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:14 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:14 AM"}}
