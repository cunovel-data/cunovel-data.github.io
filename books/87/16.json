{"id":2297,"no":16,"title":"Chapter 16","content":"1. The (state of) vacancy should be brought to the utmost degree, and that of stillness guarded with unwearying vigour. All things alike go through their processes of activity, and (then) we see them return (to their original state). When things (in the vegetable world) have displayed their luxuriant growth, we see each of them return to its root. This returning to their root is what we call the state of stillness; and that stillness may be called a reporting that they have fulfilled their appointed end.\n 2. The report of that fulfilment is the regular, unchanging rule. To know that unchanging rule is to be intelligent; not to know it leads to wild movements and evil issues. The knowledge of that unchanging rule produces a (grand) capacity and forbearance, and that capacity and forbearance lead to a community (of feeling with all things). From this community of feeling comes a kingliness of character; and he who is king-like goes on to be heaven-like. In that likeness to heaven he possesses the Tao. Possessed of the Tao, he endures long; and to the end of his bodily life, is exempt from all danger of decay.\n 懂得恢复“本来”就叫做达成了生存的恒常，懂得达到生存的恒常就叫做有明于道。不懂得达成生存的恒常而胡作非为，就会充满凶险。懂得达成生存的恒常就能雍容裕如。能雍容裕如就能得到众人的拥戴，得到众人的拥戴就可以统摄全局，统摄全局就可以像天一样，像天一样就可以进而像道一样，可以永久存在，终身没有危险。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/613/3526.html","bookId":87,"book":{"id":87,"title":"道德经 The Tao-te Ching","description":"简介： 《道德经》，又称《道德真经》《老子》《五千言》《老子五千文》，是中国古代先秦诸子分家前的一部著作，为其时诸子所共仰，传说是春秋时期的老子李耳（似是作者、注释者、传...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/120803/1-120P309250G22.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/613","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:14 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:14 AM"}}
