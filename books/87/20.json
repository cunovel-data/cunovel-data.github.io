{"id":2301,"no":20,"title":"Chapter 20","content":"2. The multitude of men look satisfied and pleased; as if enjoying a full banquet, as if mounted on a tower in spring. I alone seem listless and still, my desires having as yet given no indication of their presence. I am like an infant which has not yet smiled. I look dejected and forlorn, as if I had no home to go to. The multitude of men all have enough and to spare. I alone seem to have lost everything. My mind is that of a stupid man; I am in a state of chaos. Ordinary men look bright and intelligent, while I alone seem to be benighted. They look full of discrimination, while I alone am dull and confused. I seem to be carried about as on the sea, drifting as if I had nowhere to rest. All men have their spheres of action, while I alone seem dull and incapable, like a rude borderer. (Thus) I alone am different from other men, but I value the nursing-mother (the Tao).\n 那些去应诺附从的与那些去呵斥抗拮的，能有多大差别？那些在欣赏喜慰的与那些在嫌恶厌弃的，又相差多少？他人所畏避的，难道就非畏避不可吗？这种盲从风气久远以来到处蔓延，什么时候都没完没了！\n 人们真是喧闹喜乐、风光满面，就像享用着盛宴的美食，就像春日里奔赴高台。唯独我淡淡漠漠的，找不出任何随潮同流的迹象，就像婴儿还不懂得言笑作态，娴静而慵懒，因不附从于任何潮流而显得无所归属。\n 人们似乎都有充足的装备，而我却显得什么也不足。我真是愚人的心肠呵，混混沌沌的。人们似乎精明而睿智，而我却显得糊里糊涂。人们勤紧而利索，而我却在无可无不可地闲散游荡。摇曳灵活呵，就像大海一样；飘忽散漫呵，无拘无束。人们似乎都有足堪仗恃的本领，而我却总是不轻易出离混沌无名，就像不堪成器的鄙朴一样。我将继续我的特立独行，我崇尚求得于道。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/613/3530.html","bookId":87,"book":{"id":87,"title":"道德经 The Tao-te Ching","description":"简介： 《道德经》，又称《道德真经》《老子》《五千言》《老子五千文》，是中国古代先秦诸子分家前的一部著作，为其时诸子所共仰，传说是春秋时期的老子李耳（似是作者、注释者、传...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/120803/1-120P309250G22.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/613","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:14 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:14 AM"}}
