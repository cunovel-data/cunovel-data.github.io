{"id":2296,"no":15,"title":"Chapter 15","content":"1. The skilful masters (of the Tao) in old times, with a subtle and exquisite penetration, comprehended its mysteries, and were deep (also) so as to elude men\u0027s knowledge. As they were thus beyond men\u0027s knowledge, I will make an effort to describe of what sort they appeared to be.\n 2. Shrinking looked they like those who wade through a stream in winter; irresolute like those who are afraid of all around them; grave like a guest (in awe of his host); evanescent like ice that is melting away; unpretentious like wood that has not been fashioned into anything; vacant like a valley, and dull like muddy water.\n 3. Who can (make) the muddy water (clear)? Let it be still, and it will gradually become clear. Who can secure the condition of rest? Let movement go on, and the condition of rest will gradually arise.\n 4. They who preserve this method of the Tao do not wish to be full (of themselves). It is through their not being full of themselves that they can afford to seem worn and not appear new and complete.\n 哪些人能在混浊中保持本心的澄明？能注意守静就能渐趋本心的澄明；哪些人能使安稳得到长久的维持？懂得灵动权变就能渐得长久的安稳。保持这种生存方式的基本点就是不去追求\"无不具足\"。正因为没有\"无不具足\"，所以能历久而常新。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/613/3525.html","bookId":87,"book":{"id":87,"title":"道德经 The Tao-te Ching","description":"简介： 《道德经》，又称《道德真经》《老子》《五千言》《老子五千文》，是中国古代先秦诸子分家前的一部著作，为其时诸子所共仰，传说是春秋时期的老子李耳（似是作者、注释者、传...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/120803/1-120P309250G22.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/613","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:14 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:14 AM"}}
