Then they went their ways, nor was it long or ever Hamdir stumbled, and thrust down his hand to steady himself, and spake therewith — \n \n “Naught but a true thing spake Erp, for now should I have fallen, had not hand been to steady me.” \n \n A little after Sorli stumbled, but turned about on his feet, and so stood, and spake — \n \n “Yea now had I fallen, but that I steadied myself with both feet.” \n \n And they said they had done evilly with Erp their brother. \n \n But on they fare till they come to the abode of King Jormunrek, and they went up to him and set on him forthwith, and Hamdir cut both hands from him and Sorli both feet. Then spake Hamdir — \n \n “Off were the head if Erp were alive; our brother whom we slew on the way, and found out our deed too late.” Even as the Song says, — \n \n “Off were the head \n \n If Erp were alive yet, \n \n Our brother the bold, \n \n Whom we slew by the way, \n \n The well-famed in warfare.” \n \n Now in this must they turn away from the words of their mother, whereas they had to deal with stones. For now men fell on them, and they defended themselves in good and manly wise, and were the scathe of many a man, nor would iron bite on them. \n \n But there came thereto a certain man, old of aspect and one-eyed,51 and he spake — \n \n “No wise men are ye, whereas ye cannot bring these men to their end.” \n \n Then the king said, “Give us rede thereto, if thou canst.” \n \n He said, “Smite them to the death with stones.” \n \n In such wise was it done, for the stones flew thick and fast from every side, and that was the end of their life-days. \n \n And now has come to an end the whole root and stem of the Giukings. 52 \n \n NOW MAY ALL EARLS \n \n BE BETTERED IN MIND, \n \n MAY THE GRIEF OF ALL MAIDENS \n \n EVER BE MINISHED, \n \n FOR THIS TALE OF TROUBLE \n \n SO TOLD TO ITS ENDING. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1417/43275.html","bookId":1390,"book":{"id":1390,"title":"The Story of the Volsungs","description":"简介： It would seem fitting for a Northern folk, deriving the greater and better part of their speech, laws, and customs from a Northern root, that the North should be to them, if not a holy land, yet at least a place more to be regarded than any part of t...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1417","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:59 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:59 AM"}}
