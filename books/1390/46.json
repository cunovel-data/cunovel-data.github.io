{"id":42715,"no":46,"title":"Appendix","content":"Excerpts from the Poetic Edda. \\n\\n Part of the Second Lay of Helgi Hundings-Bane 53 \\n\\n \\n\\n Helgi wedded Sigrun, and they begate sons together, but Helgi lived not to be old; for Dag, 54 the son of Hogni, sacrificed to Odin, praying that he might avenge his father. So Odin lent Dag his spear, and Dag met Helgi, his brother-inlaw, at a place called Fetter-grove, and thrust him through with that spear, and there fell Helgi dead; but Dag rode to Sevafell, and told Sigrun of the news. \\n\\n \\n\\n DAG: \\n\\n \\n\\n Loth am I, sister \\n\\n \\n\\n Of sorrow to tell the, \\n\\n \\n\\n For by hard need driven \\n\\n \\n\\n Have I drawn on the greeting; \\n\\n \\n\\n This morning fell \\n\\n \\n\\n In Fetter-grove \\n\\n \\n\\n The king well deemed \\n\\n \\n\\n The best in the wide world, \\n\\n \\n\\n Yea, he who stood \\n\\n \\n\\n On the necks of the strong.” \\n\\n \\n\\n SIGRUN: \\n\\n \\n\\n All oaths once sworn \\n\\n \\n\\n Shall bite thee sore, \\n\\n \\n\\n The oaths that to Helgi \\n\\n \\n\\n Once thou swarest \\n\\n \\n\\n At the bright white \\n\\n \\n\\n Water of Lightening, 55 \\n\\n \\n\\n And at the cold rock \\n\\n \\n\\n That the sea runneth over. \\n\\n \\n\\n May the ship sweep not on \\n\\n \\n\\n That should sweep at its swiftest, \\n\\n \\n\\n Though the wind desired \\n\\n \\n\\n Behind thee driveth! \\n\\n \\n\\n May the horse never run \\n\\n \\n\\n That should run at his most might \\n\\n \\n\\n When from thy foe’s face \\n\\n \\n\\n Thou hast most need to flee! \\n\\n \\n\\n May the sword never bite \\n\\n \\n\\n That thou drawest from scabbard \\n\\n \\n\\n But and if round thine head \\n\\n \\n\\n In wrath it singeth! \\n\\n \\n\\n Then should meet price be paid \\n\\n \\n\\n For Helgi’s slaying \\n\\n \\n\\n When a wolf thou wert \\n\\n \\n\\n Out in the wild-wood, \\n\\n \\n\\n Empty of good things \\n\\n \\n\\n Empty of gladness, \\n\\n \\n\\n With no meat for thy mouth \\n\\n \\n\\n But dead men’s corpses! \\n\\n \\n\\n DAG: \\n\\n \\n\\n With mad words thou ravest, \\n\\n \\n\\n Thy wits are gone from thee, \\n\\n \\n\\n When thou for thy brother \\n\\n \\n\\n Such ill fate biddest; \\n\\n \\n\\n Odin alone \\n\\n \\n\\n Let all this bale loose, \\n\\n \\n\\n Casting the strife-runes \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Twixt friends and kindred. \\n\\n \\n\\n Rings of red gold \\n\\n \\n\\n Will thy brother give thee, \\n\\n \\n\\n And the stead of Vandil \\n\\n \\n\\n And the lands of Vigdale; \\n\\n \\n\\n Have half of the land \\n\\n \\n\\n For thy sorrow’s healing, \\n\\n \\n\\n O ring-arrayed sweetling \\n\\n \\n\\n For thee and thy sons! \\n\\n \\n\\n SIGRUN: \\n\\n \\n\\n No more sit I happy \\n\\n \\n\\n At Sevafell; \\n\\n \\n\\n At day-dawn, at night \\n\\n \\n\\n Naught love I my life \\n\\n \\n\\n Till broad o’er the people \\n\\n \\n\\n My lord’s light breaketh; \\n\\n \\n\\n Till his war-horse runneth \\n\\n \\n\\n Beneath him hither, \\n\\n \\n\\n Well wont to the gold bit — \\n\\n \\n\\n Till my king I welcome. \\n\\n \\n\\n In such wise did Helgi \\n\\n \\n\\n Deal fear around \\n\\n \\n\\n To all his foes \\n\\n \\n\\n And all their friends \\n\\n \\n\\n As when the goat runneth \\n\\n \\n\\n Before the wolf’s rage \\n\\n \\n\\n Filled with mad fear \\n\\n \\n\\n Down from the fell. \\n\\n \\n\\n As high above all lords \\n\\n \\n\\n Did Helgi beat him \\n\\n \\n\\n As the ash-tree’s glory \\n\\n \\n\\n From the thorn ariseth, \\n\\n \\n\\n Or as the fawn \\n\\n \\n\\n With the dew-fell sprinkled \\n\\n \\n\\n Is far above \\n\\n \\n\\n All other wild things, \\n\\n \\n\\n As his horns go gleaming \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Gainst the very heavens. \\n\\n \\n\\n A barrow was raised above Helgi, but when he came in Valhall, then Odin bade him be lord of all things there, even as he; so Helgi sang — \\n\\n \\n\\n HELGI: \\n\\n \\n\\n Now shalt thou, Hunding \\n\\n \\n\\n For the help of each man \\n\\n \\n\\n Get ready the foot-bath, \\n\\n \\n\\n And kindle the fire; \\n\\n \\n\\n The hounds shalt thou bind \\n\\n \\n\\n And give heed to the horses, \\n\\n \\n\\n Give wash to the swine \\n\\n \\n\\n Ere to sleep thou goest. \\n\\n \\n\\n A bondmaid of Sigrun went in the evening-tide by Helgi’s mound, and there saw how Helgi rode toward it with a great company; then she sang — \\n\\n \\n\\n BONDMAID: \\n\\n \\n\\n It is vain things’ beguilling \\n\\n \\n\\n That methinks I behold, \\n\\n \\n\\n Or the ending of all things, \\n\\n \\n\\n As ye ride, O ye dead men, \\n\\n \\n\\n Smiting with spurs \\n\\n \\n\\n Your horses’ sides? \\n\\n \\n\\n Or may dead warriors \\n\\n \\n\\n Wend their ways homeward? \\n\\n \\n\\n THE DEAD: \\n\\n \\n\\n No vain things’ beguiling \\n\\n \\n\\n Is that thou beholdest, \\n\\n \\n\\n Nor the ruin of all things; \\n\\n \\n\\n Though thou lookest upon us, \\n\\n \\n\\n Though we smite with spurs \\n\\n \\n\\n Our horses’ sides; \\n\\n \\n\\n Rather dead warriors \\n\\n \\n\\n May wend their ways homeward. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then went the bondmaid home, and told Sigrun, and sang — \\n\\n \\n\\n BONDMAID: \\n\\n \\n\\n Go out, Sigrun \\n\\n \\n\\n From Sevafell, \\n\\n \\n\\n If thou listest to look on \\n\\n \\n\\n The lord of thy people! \\n\\n \\n\\n For the mound is uncovered \\n\\n \\n\\n Thither is Helgi come, \\n\\n \\n\\n And his wounds are bleeding, \\n\\n \\n\\n But the king thee biddeth \\n\\n \\n\\n To come and stay \\n\\n \\n\\n That stream of sorrow. \\n\\n \\n\\n So Sigrun went into the mound to Helgi, and sang — \\n\\n \\n\\n SIGRUN: \\n\\n \\n\\n Now am I as fain \\n\\n \\n\\n Of this fair meeting, \\n\\n \\n\\n As are the hungry \\n\\n \\n\\n Hawks of Odin, \\n\\n \\n\\n When they wot of the slaying \\n\\n \\n\\n Of the yet warm quarry, \\n\\n \\n\\n Or bright with dew \\n\\n \\n\\n See the day a-dawning. \\n\\n \\n\\n Ah, I will kiss \\n\\n \\n\\n My king laid lifeless, \\n\\n \\n\\n Ere thou castest by \\n\\n \\n\\n Thy blood-stained byrny. \\n\\n \\n\\n O Helgi, thy hair \\n\\n \\n\\n Is thick with death’s rime, \\n\\n \\n\\n With the dew of the dead \\n\\n \\n\\n Is my love all dripping; \\n\\n \\n\\n Dead-cold are the hands \\n\\n \\n\\n Of the son of Hogni; \\n\\n \\n\\n How for thee, O my king, \\n\\n \\n\\n May I win healing? \\n\\n \\n\\n HELGI: \\n\\n \\n\\n Thou alone, Sigrun \\n\\n \\n\\n Of Sevafell, \\n\\n \\n\\n Hast so done that Helgi \\n\\n \\n\\n With grief’s dew drippeth; \\n\\n \\n\\n O clad in gold \\n\\n \\n\\n Cruel tears thou weepest, \\n\\n \\n\\n Bright May of the Southlands, \\n\\n \\n\\n Or ever thou sleepest; \\n\\n \\n\\n Each tear in blood falleth \\n\\n \\n\\n On the breast of thy lord, \\n\\n \\n\\n Cold wet and bitter-sharp \\n\\n \\n\\n Swollen with sorrow. \\n\\n \\n\\n Ah, we shall drink \\n\\n \\n\\n Dear draughts and lovely, \\n\\n \\n\\n Though, we have lost \\n\\n \\n\\n Both life and lands; \\n\\n \\n\\n Neither shall any \\n\\n \\n\\n Sing song of sorrow, \\n\\n \\n\\n Though in my breast \\n\\n \\n\\n Be wounds wide to behold: \\n\\n \\n\\n For now are brides \\n\\n \\n\\n In the mound abiding; \\n\\n \\n\\n Kings’ daughters sit \\n\\n \\n\\n By us departed. \\n\\n \\n\\n Bow Sigrun arrayed a bed in the mound, and sang — \\n\\n \\n\\n SIGRUN: \\n\\n \\n\\n Here, Helgi, for thee \\n\\n \\n\\n A bed have I dight, \\n\\n \\n\\n Kind without woe, \\n\\n \\n\\n O kin of the Ylfings! \\n\\n \\n\\n To thy bosom, O king, \\n\\n \\n\\n Will I come and sleep soft, \\n\\n \\n\\n As I was wont \\n\\n \\n\\n When my lord was living. \\n\\n \\n\\n HELGI: \\n\\n \\n\\n Now will I call \\n\\n \\n\\n Naught not to be hoped for \\n\\n \\n\\n Early or late \\n\\n \\n\\n At Sevafell, \\n\\n \\n\\n When thou in the arms \\n\\n \\n\\n Of a dead man art laid, \\n\\n \\n\\n White maiden of Hogni, \\n\\n \\n\\n Here in the mound: \\n\\n \\n\\n And thou yet quick, \\n\\n \\n\\n O King’s daughter! \\n\\n \\n\\n Now needs must I ride \\n\\n \\n\\n On the reddening ways; \\n\\n \\n\\n My pale horse must tread \\n\\n \\n\\n The highway aloft; \\n\\n \\n\\n West must I go \\n\\n \\n\\n To Windhelm’s bridge \\n\\n \\n\\n Ere the war-winning crowd \\n\\n \\n\\n Hall-crower 56 waketh. \\n\\n \\n\\n So Helgi rode his ways: and the others gat them gone home to the house. But the next night Sigrun bade the bondwoman have heed of the mound. So at nightfall, thenas Sigrun came to the mound, she sang: \\n\\n \\n\\n SIGRUN: \\n\\n \\n\\n Here now would he come, \\n\\n \\n\\n If to come he were minded; \\n\\n \\n\\n Sigmund’s offspring \\n\\n \\n\\n From the halls of Odin. \\n\\n \\n\\n O me the hope waneth \\n\\n \\n\\n Of Helgi’s coming; \\n\\n \\n\\n For high on the ash-boughs \\n\\n \\n\\n Are the ernes abiding, \\n\\n \\n\\n And all folk drift \\n\\n \\n\\n Toward the Thing of the dreamland. \\n\\n \\n\\n BONDMAID: \\n\\n \\n\\n Be not foolish of heart, \\n\\n \\n\\n And fare all alone \\n\\n \\n\\n To the house of the dead, \\n\\n \\n\\n O Hero’s daughter! \\n\\n \\n\\n For more strong and dreadful \\n\\n \\n\\n In the night season \\n\\n \\n\\n Are all dead warriors \\n\\n \\n\\n Than in the daylight. \\n\\n \\n\\n But a little while lived Sigrun, because of her sorrow and trouble. But in old time folk trowed that men should be born again, though their troth be now deemed but an old wife’s dotting. And so, as folk say, Helgi and Sigrun were born again, and at that tide was he called Helgi the Scathe of Hadding, and she Kara the daughter of Halfdan; and she was a Valkyrie, even as is said in the Lay of Kara. \\n\\n \\n\\n 53 Only that part of the song is given which completes the episodes of Helgi Hunding’s-bane; the earlier part of the song differs little from the Saga. \\n\\n \\n\\n 54 Hogni, the father of Dar and Sigrun, had been slain by Helgi in battle, and Helgi had given peace to, and taken oaths of Dag. \\n\\n \\n\\n 55 One of the rivers of the under-world. \\n\\n \\n\\n 56 Hall-crower, “Salgofnir”: lit. Hall-gaper, the cock of Valhall. \\n\\n Part of the Lay of Sigrdrifa 57 \\n\\n \\n\\n Now this is my first counsel, \\n\\n \\n\\n That thou with thy kin \\n\\n \\n\\n Be guiltless, guileless ever, \\n\\n \\n\\n Nor hasty of wrath, \\n\\n \\n\\n Despite of wrong done — \\n\\n \\n\\n Unto the dead good that doeth. \\n\\n \\n\\n Lo the second counsel, \\n\\n \\n\\n That oath thou swearest never, \\n\\n \\n\\n But trusty oath and true: \\n\\n \\n\\n Grim tormenting \\n\\n \\n\\n Gripes troth-breakers; \\n\\n \\n\\n Cursed wretch is the wolf of vows. \\n\\n \\n\\n This is my third rede, \\n\\n \\n\\n That thou at the Thing \\n\\n \\n\\n Deal not with the fools of folk; \\n\\n \\n\\n For unwise man \\n\\n \\n\\n From mouth lets fall \\n\\n \\n\\n Worser word than well he wotteth. \\n\\n \\n\\n Yet hard it is \\n\\n \\n\\n That holding of peace \\n\\n \\n\\n When men shall deem thee dastard, \\n\\n \\n\\n Or deem the lie said soothly; \\n\\n \\n\\n But woeful is home-witness, \\n\\n \\n\\n Unless right good thou gettest it. \\n\\n \\n\\n Ah, on another day \\n\\n \\n\\n Drive the life from out him, \\n\\n \\n\\n And pay the liar back for his lying. \\n\\n \\n\\n Now behold the fourth rede: \\n\\n \\n\\n If ill witch thee bideth, \\n\\n \\n\\n Woe-begatting by the way, \\n\\n \\n\\n Good going further \\n\\n \\n\\n Rather than guesting, \\n\\n \\n\\n Though thick night be on thee. \\n\\n \\n\\n Far-seeing eyes \\n\\n \\n\\n Need all sons of men \\n\\n \\n\\n Who wend in wrath to war; \\n\\n \\n\\n For baleful women \\n\\n \\n\\n Bide oft by the highway, \\n\\n \\n\\n Swords and hearts to soften. \\n\\n \\n\\n And now the fifth rede: \\n\\n \\n\\n As fair as thou seest \\n\\n \\n\\n Brides on the bench abiding, \\n\\n \\n\\n Let not love’s silver \\n\\n \\n\\n Rule over thy sleeping; \\n\\n \\n\\n Draw no woman to kind kissing! \\n\\n \\n\\n For the sixth thing, I rede \\n\\n \\n\\n When men sit a-drinking \\n\\n \\n\\n Amid ale-words and ill-words, \\n\\n \\n\\n Dead thou naught \\n\\n \\n\\n With the drunken fight-staves \\n\\n \\n\\n For wine stealeth wit from many. \\n\\n \\n\\n Brawling and drink \\n\\n \\n\\n Have brought unto men \\n\\n \\n\\n Sorrow sore oft enow; \\n\\n \\n\\n Yea, bane unto some, \\n\\n \\n\\n And to some weary bale; \\n\\n \\n\\n Many are the griefs of mankind. \\n\\n \\n\\n For the seventh, I rede thee, \\n\\n \\n\\n If strife thou raisest \\n\\n \\n\\n With a man right high of heart, \\n\\n \\n\\n Better fight a-field \\n\\n \\n\\n Than burn in the fire \\n\\n \\n\\n Within thine hall fair to behold. \\n\\n \\n\\n The eighth rede that I give thee: \\n\\n \\n\\n Unto all ill look thou, \\n\\n \\n\\n And hold thine heart from all beguiling; \\n\\n \\n\\n Draw to thee no maiden, \\n\\n \\n\\n No man’s wife bewray thou, \\n\\n \\n\\n Urge them not unto unmeet pleasure. \\n\\n \\n\\n This is the ninth counsel: \\n\\n \\n\\n That thou have heed of dead folk \\n\\n \\n\\n Whereso thou findest them a-field; \\n\\n \\n\\n Be they sick-dead, \\n\\n \\n\\n Be they sea-dead, \\n\\n \\n\\n Or come to ending by war-weapons. \\n\\n \\n\\n Let bath be made \\n\\n \\n\\n For such men fordone, \\n\\n \\n\\n Wash thou hands and feet thereof, \\n\\n \\n\\n Comb their hair and dry them \\n\\n \\n\\n Ere the coffin has them; \\n\\n \\n\\n Then bid them sleep full sweetly. \\n\\n \\n\\n This for the tenth counsel: \\n\\n \\n\\n That thou give trust never \\n\\n \\n\\n Unto oaths of foeman’s kin, \\n\\n \\n\\n Be’st thou bane of his brother, \\n\\n \\n\\n Or hast thou felled his father; \\n\\n \\n\\n Wolf in young son waxes, \\n\\n \\n\\n Though he with gold be gladdened. \\n\\n \\n\\n For wrong and hatred \\n\\n \\n\\n Shall rest them never, \\n\\n \\n\\n Nay, nor sore sorrow. \\n\\n \\n\\n Both wit and weapons \\n\\n \\n\\n Well must the king have \\n\\n \\n\\n Who is fain to be the foremost. \\n\\n \\n\\n The last rede and eleventh: \\n\\n \\n\\n Until all ill look thou. \\n\\n \\n\\n And watch thy friends’ ways ever \\n\\n \\n\\n Scarce durst I look \\n\\n \\n\\n For long life for thee, king: \\n\\n \\n\\n Strong trouble ariseth now already. \\n\\n \\n\\n 57 This continues the first part of the lay given in Chapter XX of the Saga; and is, in fact, the original verse of Chapter xxi. \\n\\n The Lay Called the Short Lay of Sigurd. \\n\\n \\n\\n Sigurd of yore, \\n\\n \\n\\n Sought the dwelling of Giuki, \\n\\n \\n\\n As he fared, the young Volsung, \\n\\n \\n\\n After fight won; \\n\\n \\n\\n Troth he took \\n\\n \\n\\n From the two brethren; \\n\\n \\n\\n Oath swore they betwixt them, \\n\\n \\n\\n Those bold ones of deed. \\n\\n \\n\\n A may they gave to him \\n\\n \\n\\n And wealth manifold, \\n\\n \\n\\n Gudrun the young, \\n\\n \\n\\n Giuki’s daughter: \\n\\n \\n\\n They drank and gave doom \\n\\n \\n\\n Many days together, \\n\\n \\n\\n Sigurd the young, \\n\\n \\n\\n And the sons of Giuki. \\n\\n \\n\\n Until they wended \\n\\n \\n\\n For Brynhild’s wooing, \\n\\n \\n\\n Sigurd a-riding \\n\\n \\n\\n Amidst their rout; \\n\\n \\n\\n The wise young Volsung \\n\\n \\n\\n Who knew of all ways — \\n\\n \\n\\n Ah! He had wed her, \\n\\n \\n\\n Had fate so willed it. \\n\\n \\n\\n Southlander Sigurd \\n\\n \\n\\n A naked sword, \\n\\n \\n\\n Bright, well grinded, \\n\\n \\n\\n Laid betwixt them; \\n\\n \\n\\n No kiss he won \\n\\n \\n\\n From the fair woman, \\n\\n \\n\\n Nor in arms of his \\n\\n \\n\\n Did the Hun King hold her, \\n\\n \\n\\n Since he gat the young maid \\n\\n \\n\\n For the son of Giuki. \\n\\n \\n\\n No lack in her life \\n\\n \\n\\n She wotted of now, \\n\\n \\n\\n And at her death-day \\n\\n \\n\\n No dreadful thing \\n\\n \\n\\n For a shame indeed \\n\\n \\n\\n Or a shame in seeming; \\n\\n \\n\\n But about and betwixt \\n\\n \\n\\n Went baleful fate. \\n\\n \\n\\n Alone, abroad, \\n\\n \\n\\n She sat of an evening, \\n\\n \\n\\n Of full many things \\n\\n \\n\\n She fall a-talking: \\n\\n \\n\\n “O for my Sigurd! \\n\\n \\n\\n I shall have death, \\n\\n \\n\\n Or my fair, my lovely, \\n\\n \\n\\n Laid in mine arms. \\n\\n \\n\\n “For the word once spoken, \\n\\n \\n\\n I sorrow sorely — \\n\\n \\n\\n His queen is Gudrun, \\n\\n \\n\\n I am wed to Gunnar; \\n\\n \\n\\n The dread Norns wrought for us \\n\\n \\n\\n A long while of woe.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Oft with heart deep \\n\\n \\n\\n In dreadful thoughts, \\n\\n \\n\\n O’er ice-fields and ice-hills \\n\\n \\n\\n She fared a-night time, \\n\\n \\n\\n When he and Gudrun \\n\\n \\n\\n Were gone to their fair bed, \\n\\n \\n\\n And Sigurd wrapped \\n\\n \\n\\n The bed-gear round her. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Ah!

\\n\\n \\n\\n One word Hogni \\n\\n \\n\\n Had for an answer: \\n\\n \\n\\n “Our swords have smitten \\n\\n \\n\\n Sigurd asunder, \\n\\n \\n\\n And the grey horse hangs drooping \\n\\n \\n\\n O’er his lord lying dead.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Then quoth Brynhild, \\n\\n \\n\\n Budli’s daughter; \\n\\n \\n\\n “Good weal shall ye have \\n\\n \\n\\n Of weapons and lands, \\n\\n \\n\\n That Sigurd alone \\n\\n \\n\\n Would surely have ruled \\n\\n \\n\\n If he had lived \\n\\n \\n\\n But a little longer. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Ah, nothing seemly \\n\\n \\n\\n For Sigurd to rule \\n\\n \\n\\n Giuki’s house \\n\\n \\n\\n And the folk of the Goths, \\n\\n \\n\\n When of him five sons \\n\\n \\n\\n For the slaying of men, \\n\\n \\n\\n Eager for battle, \\n\\n \\n\\n Should have been begotten!” \\n\\n \\n\\n Then laughed Brynhild — \\n\\n \\n\\n Loud rang the whole house — \\n\\n \\n\\n One laugh only \\n\\n \\n\\n From out her heart: \\n\\n \\n\\n “Long shall your bliss be \\n\\n \\n\\n Of lands and people, \\n\\n \\n\\n Whereas the famed lord \\n\\n \\n\\n You have felled to the earth!” \\n\\n \\n\\n Then spake Gudrun, \\n\\n \\n\\n Giuki’s daughter; \\n\\n \\n\\n “Much thou speakest, \\n\\n \\n\\n Many things fearful, \\n\\n \\n\\n All grame be on Gunnar \\n\\n \\n\\n The bane of Sigurd! \\n\\n \\n\\n From a heart full of hate \\n\\n \\n\\n Shall come heavy vengeance.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Forth sped the even \\n\\n \\n\\n Enow there was drunken, \\n\\n \\n\\n Full enow was there \\n\\n \\n\\n Of all soft speech; \\n\\n \\n\\n And all men got sleep \\n\\n \\n\\n When to bed they were gotten; \\n\\n \\n\\n Gunnar only lay waking \\n\\n \\n\\n Long after all men. \\n\\n \\n\\n His feet fell he to moving, \\n\\n \\n\\n Fell to speak to himself \\n\\n \\n\\n The waster of men, \\n\\n \\n\\n Still turned in his mind \\n\\n \\n\\n What on the bough \\n\\n \\n\\n Those twain would be saying, \\n\\n \\n\\n The raven and erne, \\n\\n \\n\\n As they rode their ways homeward. \\n\\n \\n\\n But Brynhild awoke, \\n\\n \\n\\n Budli’s daughter, \\n\\n \\n\\n May of the shield-folk, \\n\\n \\n\\n A little ere morning: \\n\\n \\n\\n “Thrust ye on, hold ye back, \\n\\n \\n\\n — Now all harm is wrought, — \\n\\n \\n\\n To tell of my sorrow, \\n\\n \\n\\n Or to let all slip by me?” \\n\\n \\n\\n All kept silence \\n\\n \\n\\n After her speaking, \\n\\n \\n\\n None might know \\n\\n \\n\\n That woman’s mind, \\n\\n \\n\\n Or why she must weep \\n\\n \\n\\n To tell of the work \\n\\n \\n\\n That laughing once \\n\\n \\n\\n Of men she prayed. \\n\\n \\n\\n BRYNHILD SPAKE: \\n\\n \\n\\n “In dreams, O Gunnar, \\n\\n \\n\\n Grim things fell on me; \\n\\n \\n\\n Dead-cold the hall was, \\n\\n \\n\\n And my bed was a-cold, \\n\\n \\n\\n And thou, lord, wert riding \\n\\n \\n\\n Reft of all bliss, \\n\\n \\n\\n Laden with fetters \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Mid the host of thy foemen.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “So now all ye, \\n\\n \\n\\n O House of the Niblungs, \\n\\n \\n\\n Shall be brought to naught, \\n\\n \\n\\n O ye oath-breakers! \\n\\n \\n\\n “Think’st thou not, Gunnar, \\n\\n \\n\\n How that betid, \\n\\n \\n\\n When ye let the blood run \\n\\n \\n\\n Both in one footstep? \\n\\n \\n\\n With ill reward \\n\\n \\n\\n Hast thou rewarded \\n\\n \\n\\n His heart so fain \\n\\n \\n\\n To be the foremost! \\n\\n \\n\\n “As well was seen \\n\\n \\n\\n When he rode his ways, \\n\\n \\n\\n That king of all worth, \\n\\n \\n\\n Unto my wooing; \\n\\n \\n\\n How the host-destroyer \\n\\n \\n\\n Held to the vows \\n\\n \\n\\n Sworn beforetime, \\n\\n \\n\\n Sworn to the young king. \\n\\n \\n\\n “For his wounding-wand \\n\\n \\n\\n All wrought with gold, \\n\\n \\n\\n The king beloved \\n\\n \\n\\n Laid between us; \\n\\n \\n\\n Without were its edges \\n\\n \\n\\n Wrought with fire, \\n\\n \\n\\n But with venom-drops \\n\\n \\n\\n Deep dyed within.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Thus this song telleth of the death of Sigurd, and setteth forth how that they slew him without doors; but some say that they slew him within doors, sleeping in his bed. But the Dutch Folk say that they slew him out in the wood: and so sayeth the ancient song of Gudrun, that Sigurd and the sons of Giuki were riding to the Thing whenas he was slain. But all with one accord say that they bewrayed him in their troth with him, and fell on him as he lay unarrayed and unawares. \\n\\n \\n\\n THE SECOND OR ANCIENT LAY OF GUDRUN. \\n\\n \\n\\n Thiodrek the King was in Atli’s house, and had lost there the more part of his men: so there Thiodrek and Gudrun bewailed their troubles one to the other, and she spake and said:— \\n\\n \\n\\n A may of all mays \\n\\n \\n\\n My mother reared me \\n\\n \\n\\n Bright in bower; \\n\\n \\n\\n Well loved I my brethren, \\n\\n \\n\\n Until that Giuki \\n\\n \\n\\n With gold arrayed me, \\n\\n \\n\\n With gold arrayed me, \\n\\n \\n\\n And gave me to Sigurd. \\n\\n \\n\\n Such was my Sigurd, \\n\\n \\n\\n Among the sons of Giuki \\n\\n \\n\\n As is the green leek \\n\\n \\n\\n O’er the low grass waxen, \\n\\n \\n\\n Or a hart high-limbed \\n\\n \\n\\n Over hurrying deer, \\n\\n \\n\\n Or glede-red gold \\n\\n \\n\\n Over grey silver. \\n\\n \\n\\n Till me they begrudged, \\n\\n \\n\\n Those my brethren, \\n\\n \\n\\n The fate to have him, \\n\\n \\n\\n Who was first of all men; \\n\\n \\n\\n Nor might they sleep, \\n\\n \\n\\n Nor sit a-dooming, \\n\\n \\n\\n Ere they let slay \\n\\n \\n\\n My well-loved Sigurd. \\n\\n \\n\\n Grani ran to the Thing, \\n\\n \\n\\n There was clatter to hear, \\n\\n \\n\\n But never came Sigurd \\n\\n \\n\\n Himself thereunto; \\n\\n \\n\\n All the saddle-girt beasts \\n\\n \\n\\n With blood were besprinkled, \\n\\n \\n\\n As faint with the way \\n\\n \\n\\n Neath the slayers they went. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then greeting I went \\n\\n \\n\\n With Grani to talk, \\n\\n \\n\\n And with tear-furrowed cheeks \\n\\n \\n\\n I bade him tell all; \\n\\n \\n\\n But drooping laid Grani, \\n\\n \\n\\n His head in the grass, \\n\\n \\n\\n For the steed well wotted \\n\\n \\n\\n Of his master’s slaying. \\n\\n \\n\\n A long while I wandered, \\n\\n \\n\\n Long my mind wavered, \\n\\n \\n\\n Ere the kings I might ask \\n\\n \\n\\n Concerning my king. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then Gunnar hung head, \\n\\n \\n\\n But Hogni told \\n\\n \\n\\n Of the cruel slaying \\n\\n \\n\\n Of my Sigurd: \\n\\n \\n\\n “On the water’s far side \\n\\n \\n\\n Lies, smitten to death, \\n\\n \\n\\n The bane of Guttorm \\n\\n \\n\\n To the wolves given over. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Go, look on Sigurd, \\n\\n \\n\\n On the ways that go southward, \\n\\n \\n\\n There shalt thou hear \\n\\n \\n\\n The ernes high screaming, \\n\\n \\n\\n The ravens a-croaking \\n\\n \\n\\n As their meat they crave for; \\n\\n \\n\\n Thou shalt hear the wolves howling \\n\\n \\n\\n Over thine husband. \\n\\n \\n\\n “How hast thou, Hogni, \\n\\n \\n\\n The heart to tell me, \\n\\n \\n\\n Me of joy made empty, \\n\\n \\n\\n Of such misery? \\n\\n \\n\\n Thy wretched heart \\n\\n \\n\\n May the ravens tear \\n\\n \\n\\n Wide over the world, \\n\\n \\n\\n With no men mayst thou wend.” \\n\\n \\n\\n One thing Hogni \\n\\n \\n\\n Had for answer, \\n\\n \\n\\n Fallen from his high heart, \\n\\n \\n\\n Full of all trouble: \\n\\n \\n\\n “More greeting yet, \\n\\n \\n\\n O Gudrun, for thee, \\n\\n \\n\\n If my heart the ravens \\n\\n \\n\\n Should rend asunder!” \\n\\n \\n\\n Thence I turned \\n\\n \\n\\n From the talk and the trouble \\n\\n \\n\\n To go a leasing 59 \\n\\n \\n\\n What the wolves had left me; \\n\\n \\n\\n No sigh I made \\n\\n \\n\\n No smote hands together, \\n\\n \\n\\n Nor did I wail \\n\\n \\n\\n As other women \\n\\n \\n\\n When I sat over \\n\\n \\n\\n My Sigurd slain. \\n\\n \\n\\n Night methought it, \\n\\n \\n\\n And the moonless dark, \\n\\n \\n\\n When I sat in sorrow \\n\\n \\n\\n Over Sigurd; \\n\\n \\n\\n Better than all things \\n\\n \\n\\n I deemed it would be \\n\\n \\n\\n If they would let me \\n\\n \\n\\n Cast my life by, \\n\\n \\n\\n Or burn me up \\n\\n \\n\\n As they burn the birch-wood. \\n\\n \\n\\n From the fell I wandered \\n\\n \\n\\n Five days together, \\n\\n \\n\\n Until the high hall \\n\\n \\n\\n Of Half lay before me; \\n\\n \\n\\n Seven seasons there \\n\\n \\n\\n I sat with Thora, \\n\\n \\n\\n The daughter of Hacon, \\n\\n \\n\\n Up in Denmark. \\n\\n \\n\\n My heart to gladden \\n\\n \\n\\n With gold she wrought \\n\\n \\n\\n Southland halls \\n\\n \\n\\n And swans of the Dane-folk; \\n\\n \\n\\n There had we painted \\n\\n \\n\\n The chiefs a-playing; \\n\\n \\n\\n Fair our hands wrought \\n\\n \\n\\n Folk of the kings. \\n\\n \\n\\n Red shields we did, \\n\\n \\n\\n Doughty knights of the Huns, \\n\\n \\n\\n Hosts spear-dight, hosts helm-dight, \\n\\n \\n\\n All a high king’s fellows; \\n\\n \\n\\n And the ships of Sigmund \\n\\n \\n\\n From the land swift sailing; \\n\\n \\n\\n Heads gilt over \\n\\n \\n\\n And prows fair graven. \\n\\n \\n\\n On the cloth we broidered \\n\\n \\n\\n That tide of their battling, \\n\\n \\n\\n Siggeir and Siggar, \\n\\n \\n\\n South in Fion. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then heard Grimhild, \\n\\n \\n\\n The Queen of Gothland, \\n\\n \\n\\n How I was abiding, \\n\\n \\n\\n Weighed down with woe; \\n\\n \\n\\n And she thrust the cloth from her \\n\\n \\n\\n And called to her sons, \\n\\n \\n\\n And oft and eagerly \\n\\n \\n\\n Asked them thereof, \\n\\n \\n\\n Who for her son \\n\\n \\n\\n Would their sister atone, \\n\\n \\n\\n Who for her lord slain \\n\\n \\n\\n Would lay down weregild. \\n\\n \\n\\n Fain was Gunnar \\n\\n \\n\\n Gold to lay down \\n\\n \\n\\n All wrongs to atone for, \\n\\n \\n\\n And Hogni in likewise; \\n\\n \\n\\n Then she asked who was fain \\n\\n \\n\\n Of faring straightly, \\n\\n \\n\\n The steed to saddle \\n\\n \\n\\n To set forth the wain, \\n\\n \\n\\n The horse to back, \\n\\n \\n\\n And the hawk to fly, \\n\\n \\n\\n To shoot forth the arrow \\n\\n \\n\\n From out the yew-bow. \\n\\n \\n\\n Valdarr the Dane-king \\n\\n \\n\\n Came with Jarisleif \\n\\n \\n\\n Eymod the third went \\n\\n \\n\\n Then went Jarizskar; \\n\\n \\n\\n In kingly wise \\n\\n \\n\\n In they wended, \\n\\n \\n\\n The host of the Longbeards; \\n\\n \\n\\n Red cloaks had they, \\n\\n \\n\\n Byrnies short-cut, \\n\\n \\n\\n Helms strong hammered, \\n\\n \\n\\n Girt with glaives, \\n\\n \\n\\n And hair red-gleaming. \\n\\n \\n\\n Each would give me \\n\\n \\n\\n Gifts desired, \\n\\n \\n\\n Gifts desired, \\n\\n \\n\\n Speech dear to my heart, \\n\\n \\n\\n If they might yet, \\n\\n \\n\\n Despite my sorrow, \\n\\n \\n\\n Win back my trust, \\n\\n \\n\\n But in them nought I trusted. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then brought me Grimhild \\n\\n \\n\\n A beaker to drink of, \\n\\n \\n\\n Cold and bitter, \\n\\n \\n\\n Wrong’s memory to quench; \\n\\n \\n\\n Made great was that drink \\n\\n \\n\\n With the might of the earth, \\n\\n \\n\\n With the death-cold sea \\n\\n \\n\\n And the blood that Son 60 holdeth. \\n\\n \\n\\n On that horn’s face were there \\n\\n \\n\\n All the kin of letters \\n\\n \\n\\n Cut aright and reddened, \\n\\n \\n\\n How should I rede them rightly? \\n\\n \\n\\n The ling-fish long \\n\\n \\n\\n Of the land of Hadding, \\n\\n \\n\\n Wheat-ears unshorn, \\n\\n \\n\\n And wild things’ inwards. \\n\\n \\n\\n In that mead were mingled \\n\\n \\n\\n Many ills together, \\n\\n \\n\\n Blood of all the wood, \\n\\n \\n\\n And brown-burnt acorns; \\n\\n \\n\\n The black dew of the hearth, 61 \\n\\n \\n\\n And god-doomed dead beasts’ inwards \\n\\n \\n\\n And the swine’s liver sodden, \\n\\n \\n\\n For wrongs late done that deadens. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then waned my memory \\n\\n \\n\\n When that was within me, \\n\\n \\n\\n Of my lord ‘mid the hall \\n\\n \\n\\n By the iron laid low. \\n\\n \\n\\n Three kings came \\n\\n \\n\\n Before my knees \\n\\n \\n\\n Ere she herself \\n\\n \\n\\n Fell to speech with me. \\n\\n \\n\\n “I will give to thee, Gudrun, \\n\\n \\n\\n Gold to be glad with, \\n\\n \\n\\n All the great wealth \\n\\n \\n\\n Of thy father gone from us, \\n\\n \\n\\n Rings of red gold \\n\\n \\n\\n And the great hall of Lodver, \\n\\n \\n\\n And all fair hangings left \\n\\n \\n\\n By the king late fallen. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Maids of the Huns \\n\\n \\n\\n Woven pictures to make, \\n\\n \\n\\n And work fair in gold \\n\\n \\n\\n Till thou deem’st thyself glad. \\n\\n \\n\\n Alone shalt thou rule \\n\\n \\n\\n O’er the riches of Budli, \\n\\n \\n\\n Shalt be made great with gold, \\n\\n \\n\\n And be given to Atli.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Never will I \\n\\n \\n\\n Wend to a husband, \\n\\n \\n\\n Or wed the brother \\n\\n \\n\\n Of Queen Brynhild; \\n\\n \\n\\n Naught it beseems me \\n\\n \\n\\n With the son of Budli \\n\\n \\n\\n Kin to bring forth, \\n\\n \\n\\n Or to live and be merry.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Nay, the high chiefs \\n\\n \\n\\n Reward not with hatred, \\n\\n \\n\\n For take heed that I \\n\\n \\n\\n Was the first in this tale! \\n\\n \\n\\n To thy heart shall it be \\n\\n \\n\\n As if both these had life, \\n\\n \\n\\n Sigurd and Sigmund, \\n\\n \\n\\n When thou hast borne sons.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Naught may I, Grimhild, \\n\\n \\n\\n Seek after gladness, \\n\\n \\n\\n Nor deem aught hopeful \\n\\n \\n\\n Of any high warrior, \\n\\n \\n\\n Since wolf and raven \\n\\n \\n\\n Were friends together, \\n\\n \\n\\n The greedy, the cruel, \\n\\n \\n\\n O’er great Sigurd’s heart-blood.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Of all men that can be \\n\\n \\n\\n For the noblest of kin \\n\\n \\n\\n This king have I found, \\n\\n \\n\\n And the foremost of all; \\n\\n \\n\\n Him shalt thou have \\n\\n \\n\\n Till with eld thou art heavy — \\n\\n \\n\\n Be thou ever unwed, \\n\\n \\n\\n If thou wilt naught of him!” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Nay, nay, bid me not \\n\\n \\n\\n With thy words long abiding \\n\\n \\n\\n To take unto me \\n\\n \\n\\n That balefullest kin; \\n\\n \\n\\n This king shall bid Gunnar \\n\\n \\n\\n Be stung to his bane, \\n\\n \\n\\n And shall cut the heart \\n\\n \\n\\n From out of Hogni. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Nor shall I leave life \\n\\n \\n\\n Ere the keen lord, \\n\\n \\n\\n The eager in sword-play, \\n\\n \\n\\n My hand shall make end of.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Grimhild a-weeping \\n\\n \\n\\n Took up the word then, \\n\\n \\n\\n When the sore bale she wotted \\n\\n \\n\\n Awaiting her sons, \\n\\n \\n\\n And the bane hanging over \\n\\n \\n\\n Her offspring beloved. \\n\\n \\n\\n “I will give thee, moreover, \\n\\n \\n\\n Great lands, many men, \\n\\n \\n\\n Wineberg and Valberg, \\n\\n \\n\\n If thou wilt but have them; \\n\\n \\n\\n Hold them lifelong, \\n\\n \\n\\n And live happy, O daughter!” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Then him must I take \\n\\n \\n\\n From among kingly men, \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Gainst my heart’s desire, \\n\\n \\n\\n From the hands of my kinsfolk; \\n\\n \\n\\n But no joy I look \\n\\n \\n\\n To have from that lord: \\n\\n \\n\\n Scarce may my brother’s bane \\n\\n \\n\\n Be a shield to my sons.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Soon was each warrior \\n\\n \\n\\n Seen on his horse, \\n\\n \\n\\n But the Gaulish women \\n\\n \\n\\n Into wains were gotten; \\n\\n \\n\\n Then seven days long \\n\\n \\n\\n O’er a cold land we rode, \\n\\n \\n\\n And for seven other \\n\\n \\n\\n Clove we the sea-waves. \\n\\n \\n\\n But with the third seven \\n\\n \\n\\n O’er dry land we wended. \\n\\n \\n\\n There the gate-wardens \\n\\n \\n\\n Of the burg, high and wide, \\n\\n \\n\\n Unlooked the barriers \\n\\n \\n\\n Ere the burg-garth we rode to — \\n\\n ***** \\n\\n ***** \\n\\n \\n\\n Atli woke me \\n\\n \\n\\n When meseemed I was \\n\\n \\n\\n Full evil of heart \\n\\n \\n\\n For my kin dead slain. \\n\\n \\n\\n “In such wise did the Norns \\n\\n \\n\\n Wake me or now.” — \\n\\n \\n\\n Fain was he to know \\n\\n \\n\\n Of this ill foreshowing — \\n\\n \\n\\n “That methought, O Gudrun, \\n\\n \\n\\n Giuki’s daughter, \\n\\n \\n\\n That thou setst in my heart \\n\\n \\n\\n A sword wrought for guile.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “For fires tokening I deem it \\n\\n \\n\\n That dreaming of iron, \\n\\n \\n\\n But for pride and for lust \\n\\n \\n\\n The wrath of fair women \\n\\n \\n\\n Against some bale \\n\\n \\n\\n Belike, I shall burn thee \\n\\n \\n\\n For thy solace and healing \\n\\n \\n\\n Though hateful thou art.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “In the fair garth methought \\n\\n \\n\\n Had saplings fallen \\n\\n \\n\\n E’en such as I would \\n\\n \\n\\n Should have waxen ever; \\n\\n \\n\\n Uprooted were these, \\n\\n \\n\\n And reddened with blood, \\n\\n \\n\\n And borne to the bench, \\n\\n \\n\\n And folk bade me eat of them. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Methought from my hand then \\n\\n \\n\\n Went hawks a-flying \\n\\n \\n\\n Lacking their meat \\n\\n \\n\\n To the land of all ill; \\n\\n \\n\\n Methought that their hearts \\n\\n \\n\\n Mingled with honey, \\n\\n \\n\\n Swollen with blood \\n\\n \\n\\n I ate amid sorrow. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Lo, next two whelps \\n\\n \\n\\n From my hands I loosened, \\n\\n \\n\\n Joyless were both, \\n\\n \\n\\n And both a-howling; \\n\\n \\n\\n And now their flesh \\n\\n \\n\\n Became naught but corpses, \\n\\n \\n\\n Whereof must I eat \\n\\n \\n\\n But sore against my will.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “O’er the prey of the fishers \\n\\n \\n\\n Will folk give doom; \\n\\n \\n\\n From the bright white fish \\n\\n \\n\\n The heads will they take; \\n\\n \\n\\n Within a few nights, \\n\\n \\n\\n Fey as they are, \\n\\n \\n\\n A little ere day \\n\\n \\n\\n Of that draught will they eat.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Ne’er since lay I down, \\n\\n \\n\\n Ne’er since would I sleep, \\n\\n \\n\\n Hard of heart, in my bed:— \\n\\n \\n\\n That deed have I to do. 62 \\n\\n \\n\\n 59 The original has “a vid lesa”. “Leasing” is the word still used for gleaning in many country sides in England. \\n\\n \\n\\n 60 Son was the vessel into which was poured the blood of Quasir, the God of Poetry. \\n\\n \\n\\n 61 This means soot. \\n\\n \\n\\n 62 The whole of this latter part is fragmentary and obscure; there seems wanting to two of the dreams some trivial interpretation by Gudrun, like those given by Hogni to Kostbera in the Saga, of which nature, of course, the interpretation contained in the last stanza but one is, as we have rendered it: another rendering, from the different reading of the earlier edition of “Edda” (Copenhagen, 1818) would make this refer much more directly to the slaying of her sons by Gudrun. \\n\\n \\n\\n THE SONG OF ATLI. \\n\\n \\n\\n Gudrun, Giuki’s daughter, avenger her brethren, as is told far and wide; first she slew the sons of Atli, and then Atli himself; and she burned the hall thereafter, and all the household with it: and about these matters is this song made:— \\n\\n \\n\\n In days long gone \\n\\n \\n\\n Sent Atli to Gunnar \\n\\n \\n\\n A crafty one riding, \\n\\n \\n\\n Knefrud men called him; \\n\\n \\n\\n To Giuki’s garth came he, \\n\\n \\n\\n To the hall of Gunnar, \\n\\n \\n\\n To the benches gay-dight, \\n\\n \\n\\n And the gladsome drinking. \\n\\n \\n\\n There drank the great folk \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Mid the guileful one’s silence, \\n\\n \\n\\n Drank wine in their fair hall: \\n\\n \\n\\n The Huns’ wrath they feared \\n\\n \\n\\n When Knefrud cried \\n\\n \\n\\n In his cold voice, \\n\\n \\n\\n As he sat on the high seat, \\n\\n \\n\\n That man of the Southland: \\n\\n \\n\\n “Atli has sent me \\n\\n \\n\\n Riding swift on his errands \\n\\n \\n\\n On the bit-griping steed \\n\\n \\n\\n Through dark woodways unbeaten, \\n\\n \\n\\n To bid thee, King Gunnar, \\n\\n \\n\\n Come to his fair bench \\n\\n \\n\\n With helm well-adorned, \\n\\n \\n\\n To the house of King Atli. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Shield shall ye have there \\n\\n \\n\\n And spears ashen-shafted, \\n\\n \\n\\n Helms ruddy with gold, \\n\\n \\n\\n And hosts of the Huns; \\n\\n \\n\\n Saddle-gear silver gilt, \\n\\n \\n\\n Shirts red as blood, \\n\\n \\n\\n The hedge of the warwife, \\n\\n \\n\\n And horses bit-griping. \\n\\n \\n\\n “And he saith he will give you \\n\\n \\n\\n Gnitaheath widespread, \\n\\n \\n\\n And whistling spears \\n\\n \\n\\n And prows well-gilded, \\n\\n \\n\\n Might wealth \\n\\n \\n\\n With the stead of Danpi, \\n\\n \\n\\n And that noble wood \\n\\n \\n\\n Men name the Murkwood.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Then Gunnar turned head \\n\\n \\n\\n And spake unto Hogni: \\n\\n \\n\\n “What rede from thee, high one, \\n\\n \\n\\n Since such things we hear? \\n\\n \\n\\n No gold know I \\n\\n \\n\\n On Gnitaheath, \\n\\n \\n\\n That we for our parts \\n\\n \\n\\n Have not portion as great. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Seven halls we have \\n\\n \\n\\n Fulfilled of swords, \\n\\n \\n\\n And hilts of gold \\n\\n \\n\\n Each sword there has; \\n\\n \\n\\n My horse is the best, \\n\\n \\n\\n My blade is the keenest; \\n\\n \\n\\n Fair my bow o’er the bench is, \\n\\n \\n\\n Gleams my byrny with gold; \\n\\n \\n\\n Brightest helm, brightest shield, \\n\\n \\n\\n From Kiar’s dwelling ere brought — \\n\\n \\n\\n Better all things I have \\n\\n \\n\\n Than all things of the Huns.” \\n\\n \\n\\n HOGNI SAID: \\n\\n \\n\\n “What mind has our sister \\n\\n \\n\\n That a ring she hath sent us \\n\\n \\n\\n In weed of wolves clad? \\n\\n \\n\\n Bids she not to be wary? \\n\\n \\n\\n For a wolf’s hair I found \\n\\n \\n\\n The fair ring wreathed about; \\n\\n \\n\\n Wolf beset shall the way be \\n\\n \\n\\n If we wend on this errand.” \\n\\n \\n\\n No sons whetted Gunnar, \\n\\n \\n\\n Nor none of his kin, \\n\\n \\n\\n Nor learned men nor wise men, \\n\\n \\n\\n Nor such as were mighty. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then spake Gunnar \\n\\n \\n\\n E’en as a king should speak, \\n\\n \\n\\n Glorious in mead-hall \\n\\n \\n\\n From great heart and high: \\n\\n \\n\\n “Rise up now, Fiornir, \\n\\n \\n\\n Forth down the benches \\n\\n \\n\\n Let the gold-cups of great ones \\n\\n \\n\\n Pass in hands of my good-men! \\n\\n \\n\\n Well shall we drink wine, \\n\\n \\n\\n Draughts dear to our hearts, \\n\\n \\n\\n Though the last of all feasts \\n\\n \\n\\n In our fair house this be! \\n\\n \\n\\n “For the wolves shall rule \\n\\n \\n\\n O’er the wealth of the Niblungs, \\n\\n \\n\\n With the pine-woods’ wardens \\n\\n \\n\\n In Gunnar perish: \\n\\n \\n\\n And the black-felled bears \\n\\n \\n\\n With fierce teeth shall bite \\n\\n \\n\\n For the glee of the dog kind, \\n\\n \\n\\n If again comes not Gunnar.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Then good men never shamed, \\n\\n \\n\\n Greeting aloud, \\n\\n \\n\\n Led the great king of men \\n\\n \\n\\n From the garth of his home; \\n\\n \\n\\n And cried the fair son \\n\\n \\n\\n Of Hogni the king: \\n\\n \\n\\n “Fare happy, O Lords, \\n\\n \\n\\n Whereso your hearts lead you!” \\n\\n \\n\\n Then the bold knights \\n\\n \\n\\n Let their bit-griping steeds \\n\\n \\n\\n Wend swift o’er the fells, \\n\\n \\n\\n Tread the murk-wood unknown, \\n\\n \\n\\n All the Hunwood was shaking \\n\\n \\n\\n As the hardy ones fared there; \\n\\n \\n\\n O’er the green meads they urged \\n\\n \\n\\n Their steeds shy of the goad. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then Atli’s land saw they; \\n\\n \\n\\n Great towers and strong, \\n\\n \\n\\n And the bold men of Bikki, \\n\\n \\n\\n Aloft on the burg: \\n\\n \\n\\n The Southland folks’ hall \\n\\n \\n\\n Set with benches about, \\n\\n \\n\\n Dight with bucklers well bounden, \\n\\n \\n\\n And bright white shining shields. \\n\\n \\n\\n There drank Atli, \\n\\n \\n\\n The awful Hun king, \\n\\n \\n\\n Wine in his fair hall; \\n\\n \\n\\n Without were the warders, \\n\\n \\n\\n Gunnar’s folk to have heed of, \\n\\n \\n\\n Lest they had fared thither \\n\\n \\n\\n With the whistling spear \\n\\n \\n\\n War to wake ‘gainst the king. \\n\\n \\n\\n But first came their sister \\n\\n \\n\\n As they came to the hall, \\n\\n \\n\\n Both her brethren she met, \\n\\n \\n\\n With beer little gladdened: \\n\\n \\n\\n “Bewrayed art thou, Gunnar! \\n\\n \\n\\n What dost thou great king \\n\\n \\n\\n To deal war to the Huns? \\n\\n \\n\\n Go thou swift from the hall! \\n\\n \\n\\n Better, brother, hadst thou \\n\\n \\n\\n Fared here in thy byrny \\n\\n \\n\\n Than with helm gaily dight \\n\\n \\n\\n Looked on Atli’s great house: \\n\\n \\n\\n Them hadst sat then in saddle \\n\\n \\n\\n Through days bright with the sun \\n\\n \\n\\n Fight to awaken \\n\\n \\n\\n And fair fields to redden: \\n\\n \\n\\n “O’er the folk fate makes pale \\n\\n \\n\\n Should the Norn’s tears have fallen, \\n\\n \\n\\n The shield mays of the Huns \\n\\n \\n\\n Should have known of all sorrow; \\n\\n \\n\\n And King Atli himself \\n\\n \\n\\n To worm-close should be brought; \\n\\n \\n\\n But now is the worm-close \\n\\n \\n\\n Kept but for thee.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Then spake Gunnar \\n\\n \\n\\n Great ‘mid the people: \\n\\n \\n\\n “Over-late sister \\n\\n \\n\\n The Niblungs to summon; \\n\\n \\n\\n A long way to seek \\n\\n \\n\\n The helping of warriors, \\n\\n \\n\\n The high lord unshamed, \\n\\n \\n\\n From the hills of the Rhine!” \\n\\n ***** \\n\\n ***** \\n\\n \\n\\n Seven Hogni beat down \\n\\n \\n\\n With his sword sharp-grinded, \\n\\n \\n\\n And the eighth man he thrust \\n\\n \\n\\n Amidst of the fire. \\n\\n \\n\\n Ever so shall famed warrior \\n\\n \\n\\n Fight with his foemen, \\n\\n \\n\\n As Hogni fought \\n\\n \\n\\n For the hand of Gunnar. \\n\\n \\n\\n But on Gunnar they fell, \\n\\n \\n\\n And set him in fetters, \\n\\n \\n\\n And bound hard and fast \\n\\n \\n\\n That friend of Burgundians; \\n\\n \\n\\n Then the warrior they asked \\n\\n \\n\\n If he would buy life, \\n\\n \\n\\n But life with gold \\n\\n \\n\\n That king of the Goths. \\n\\n \\n\\n Nobly spake Gunnar, \\n\\n \\n\\n Great lord of the Niblungs; \\n\\n \\n\\n “Hogni’s bleeding heart first \\n\\n \\n\\n Shall lie in mine hand, \\n\\n \\n\\n Cut from the breast \\n\\n \\n\\n Of the bold-riding lord, \\n\\n \\n\\n With bitter-sharp knife \\n\\n \\n\\n From the son of the king.” \\n\\n \\n\\n With guile the great one \\n\\n \\n\\n Would they beguile, \\n\\n \\n\\n On the wailing thrall \\n\\n \\n\\n Laid they hand unwares, \\n\\n \\n\\n And cut the heart \\n\\n \\n\\n From out of Hjalli, \\n\\n \\n\\n Laid it bleeding on trencher \\n\\n \\n\\n And bare it to Gunnar. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Here have I the heart \\n\\n \\n\\n Of Hjalli the trembler, \\n\\n \\n\\n Little like the heart \\n\\n \\n\\n Of Hogni the hardy: \\n\\n \\n\\n As much as it trembleth \\n\\n \\n\\n Laid on the trencher \\n\\n \\n\\n By the half more it trembled \\n\\n \\n\\n In the breast of him hidden.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Then laughed Hogni \\n\\n \\n\\n When they cut the heart from him, \\n\\n \\n\\n From the crest-smith yet quick, \\n\\n \\n\\n Little thought he to quail. \\n\\n \\n\\n The hard acorn of thought \\n\\n \\n\\n From the high king they took, \\n\\n \\n\\n Laid it bleeding on trencher \\n\\n \\n\\n And bare it Gunnar. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Here have I the heart \\n\\n \\n\\n Of Hogni the hardy, \\n\\n \\n\\n Little like to the heart \\n\\n \\n\\n Of Hjalli the trembler. \\n\\n \\n\\n Howso little it quaketh \\n\\n \\n\\n Laid here on the dish, \\n\\n \\n\\n Yet far less it quaked \\n\\n \\n\\n In the breast of him laid. \\n\\n \\n\\n “So far mayst thou bide \\n\\n \\n\\n From men’s eyen, O Atli, \\n\\n \\n\\n As from that treasure \\n\\n \\n\\n Thou shalt abide! \\n\\n \\n\\n “Behold in my heart \\n\\n \\n\\n Is hidden for ever \\n\\n \\n\\n That hoard of the Niblungs, \\n\\n \\n\\n Now Hogni is dead. \\n\\n \\n\\n Doubt threw me two ways \\n\\n \\n\\n While the twain of us lived, \\n\\n \\n\\n But all that is gone \\n\\n \\n\\n Now I live on alone. \\n\\n \\n\\n “The great Rhine shall rule \\n\\n \\n\\n O’er the hate-raising treasure, \\n\\n \\n\\n That gold of the Niblungs, \\n\\n \\n\\n The seed of the gods: \\n\\n \\n\\n In the weltering water \\n\\n \\n\\n Shall that wealth lie a-gleaming, \\n\\n \\n\\n Or it shine on the hands \\n\\n \\n\\n Of the children of Huns!” \\n\\n \\n\\n Then cried Atli, \\n\\n \\n\\n King of the Hun-folk, \\n\\n \\n\\n “Drive forth your wains now \\n\\n \\n\\n The slave is fast bounden.” \\n\\n \\n\\n And straightly thence \\n\\n \\n\\n The bit-shaking steeds \\n\\n \\n\\n Drew the hoard-warden, \\n\\n \\n\\n The war-god to his death. \\n\\n \\n\\n Atli the great king, \\n\\n \\n\\n Rode upon Glaum, \\n\\n \\n\\n With shields set round about, \\n\\n \\n\\n And sharp thorns of battle: \\n\\n \\n\\n Gudrun, bound by wedlock \\n\\n \\n\\n To these, victory made gods of, \\n\\n \\n\\n Held back her tears \\n\\n \\n\\n As the hall she ran into. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Let it fare with thee, Atli, \\n\\n \\n\\n E’en after thine oaths sworn \\n\\n \\n\\n To Gunnar fell often; \\n\\n \\n\\n Yea, oaths sworn of old time, \\n\\n \\n\\n By the sun sloping southward, \\n\\n \\n\\n By the high burg of Sigry, \\n\\n \\n\\n By the fair bed of rest, \\n\\n \\n\\n By the red ring of Ull!” \\n\\n \\n\\n Now a host of men \\n\\n \\n\\n Cast the high king alive \\n\\n \\n\\n Into a close \\n\\n \\n\\n Crept o’er within \\n\\n \\n\\n With most foul worms, \\n\\n \\n\\n Fulfilled of all venom, \\n\\n \\n\\n Ready grave to dig \\n\\n \\n\\n In his doughty heart. \\n\\n \\n\\n Wrathful-hearted he smote \\n\\n \\n\\n The harp with his hand, \\n\\n \\n\\n Gunnar laid there alone; \\n\\n \\n\\n And loud rang the strings. — \\n\\n \\n\\n In such wise ever \\n\\n \\n\\n Should hardy ring-scatterer \\n\\n \\n\\n Keep gold from all folk \\n\\n \\n\\n In the garth of his foeman. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then Atli would wend \\n\\n \\n\\n About his wide land, \\n\\n \\n\\n On his steed brazen shod, \\n\\n \\n\\n Back from the murder. \\n\\n \\n\\n Din there was in the garth, \\n\\n \\n\\n All thronged with the horses; \\n\\n \\n\\n High the weapon-song rose \\n\\n \\n\\n From men come from the heath. \\n\\n \\n\\n Out then went Gudrun, \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Gainst Atli returning, \\n\\n \\n\\n With a cup gilded over, \\n\\n \\n\\n To greet the land’s ruler; \\n\\n \\n\\n “Come, then, and take it, \\n\\n \\n\\n King glad in thine hall, \\n\\n \\n\\n From Gudrun’s hands, \\n\\n \\n\\n For the hell-farers groan not!” \\n\\n \\n\\n Clashed the beakers of Atli, \\n\\n \\n\\n Wine-laden on bench, \\n\\n \\n\\n As in hall there a-gathered, \\n\\n \\n\\n The Huns fell a-talking, \\n\\n \\n\\n And the long-bearded eager ones \\n\\n \\n\\n Entered therein, \\n\\n \\n\\n From a murk den new-come, \\n\\n \\n\\n From the murder of Gunnar. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then hastened the sweet-faced \\n\\n \\n\\n Delight of the shield-folk, \\n\\n \\n\\n Bright in the fair hall, \\n\\n \\n\\n Wine to bear to them: \\n\\n \\n\\n The dreadful woman \\n\\n \\n\\n Gave dainties withal \\n\\n \\n\\n To the lords pale with fate, \\n\\n \\n\\n Laid strange word upon Atli: \\n\\n \\n\\n “The hearts of thy sons \\n\\n \\n\\n Hast thou eaten, sword-dealer, \\n\\n \\n\\n All bloody with death \\n\\n \\n\\n And drenched with honey: \\n\\n \\n\\n In most heavy mood \\n\\n \\n\\n Brood o’er venison of men! \\n\\n \\n\\n Drink rich draughts therewith, \\n\\n \\n\\n Down the high benches send it! \\n\\n \\n\\n “Never callest thou now \\n\\n \\n\\n From henceforth to thy knee \\n\\n \\n\\n Fair Erp or fair Eiril, \\n\\n \\n\\n Bright-faced with the drink;

\\n\\n \\n\\n All saving Gudrun, \\n\\n \\n\\n Who never gat greeting, \\n\\n \\n\\n For her brethren bear-hardy \\n\\n \\n\\n For her sweet sons and bright, \\n\\n \\n\\n The young ones, the simple \\n\\n \\n\\n Once gotten with Atli. \\n\\n ***** \\n\\n ***** \\n\\n \\n\\n The seed of gold \\n\\n \\n\\n Sowed the swan-bright woman, \\n\\n \\n\\n Rings of red gold \\n\\n \\n\\n She gave to the house-carls;

\\n\\n \\n\\n No weapon had he, \\n\\n \\n\\n No heeding of Gudrun — \\n\\n \\n\\n Ah, the pity would be better, \\n\\n \\n\\n When in soft wise they twain \\n\\n \\n\\n Would full often embrace \\n\\n \\n\\n Before the great lords! \\n\\n \\n\\n To the bed with sword-point \\n\\n \\n\\n Blood gave she to drink \\n\\n \\n\\n With a hand fain of death, \\n\\n \\n\\n And she let the dogs loose: \\n\\n \\n\\n Then in from the hall-door — \\n\\n \\n\\n — Up waked the house-carls — \\n\\n \\n\\n Hot brands she cast, \\n\\n \\n\\n Gat revenge for her brethren. \\n\\n \\n\\n To the flame gave she all \\n\\n \\n\\n Who therein might be found; \\n\\n \\n\\n Fell adown the old timbers, \\n\\n \\n\\n Reeked all treasure-houses; \\n\\n \\n\\n There the shield-mays were burnt, \\n\\n \\n\\n Their lives’ span brought to naught; \\n\\n \\n\\n In the fierce fire sank down \\n\\n \\n\\n All the stead of the Budlungs. \\n\\n \\n\\n Wide told of is this — \\n\\n \\n\\n Ne’er sithence in the world, \\n\\n \\n\\n Thus fared bride clad in byrny \\n\\n \\n\\n For her brothers’ avenging; \\n\\n \\n\\n For behold, this fair woman \\n\\n \\n\\n To three kings of the people, \\n\\n \\n\\n Hath brought very death \\n\\n \\n\\n Or ever she died! \\n\\n \\n\\n THE WHETTING OF GUDRUN. \\n\\n \\n\\n Gudrun went down unto the sea whenas she had slain Atli, and she cast herself therein, for she was fain to end her life: but nowise might she drown. She drave over the firths to the land of King Jonakr, and he wedded her, and their sons were Sorli, and Erp, and Hamdir, and there was Swanhild, Sigurd’s daughter, nourished: and she was given to Jormunrek the Mighty. Now Bikki was a man of his, and gave such counsel to Randver, the king’s son, as that he should take her; and with that counsel were the young folk well content. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then Bikki told the king, and the king let hang Randver, but bade Swanhild be trodden under horses’ feet. But when Gudrun heard thereof, she spake to her sons — \\n\\n \\n\\n Words of strife heard I, \\n\\n \\n\\n Huger than any, \\n\\n \\n\\n Woeful words spoken, \\n\\n \\n\\n Sprung from all sorrow, \\n\\n \\n\\n When Gudrun fierce-hearted \\n\\n \\n\\n With the grimmest of words \\n\\n \\n\\n Whetter her sons \\n\\n \\n\\n Unto the slaying. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Why are ye sitting here? \\n\\n \\n\\n Why sleep ye life away? \\n\\n \\n\\n Why doth it grieve you nought? \\n\\n \\n\\n Glad words to speak, \\n\\n \\n\\n Now when your sister — \\n\\n \\n\\n Young of years was she — \\n\\n \\n\\n Has Jormunrek trodden \\n\\n \\n\\n With the treading of horses? — \\n\\n \\n\\n “Black horses and white \\n\\n \\n\\n In the highway of warriors; \\n\\n \\n\\n Grey horses that know \\n\\n \\n\\n The roads of the Goths. — \\n\\n \\n\\n “Little like are ye grown \\n\\n \\n\\n To that Gunnar of old days! \\n\\n \\n\\n Nought are your hearts \\n\\n \\n\\n As the heart of Hogni! \\n\\n \\n\\n Well would ye seek \\n\\n \\n\\n Vengeance to win \\n\\n \\n\\n If your mood were in aught \\n\\n \\n\\n As the mood of my brethren, \\n\\n \\n\\n Or the hardy hearts \\n\\n \\n\\n Of the Kings of the Huns!” \\n\\n \\n\\n Then spake Hamdir, \\n\\n \\n\\n The high-hearted — \\n\\n \\n\\n “Little didst thou \\n\\n \\n\\n Praise Hogni’s doings, \\n\\n \\n\\n When Sigurd woke \\n\\n \\n\\n From out of sleep, \\n\\n \\n\\n And the blue-white bed-gear \\n\\n \\n\\n Upon thy bed \\n\\n \\n\\n Grew red with man’s blood — \\n\\n \\n\\n With the blood of thy mate!

Now she might nowise be made lighter of a child she travailed with, before Oddrun, Atil’s sister, came to her, — she who had been the love of Gunnar, Giuki’s son. But of their speech together has this been sung: \\n\\n \\n\\n I have hear tell \\n\\n \\n\\n In ancient tales \\n\\n \\n\\n How a may there came \\n\\n \\n\\n To Morna-land, \\n\\n \\n\\n Because no man \\n\\n \\n\\n On mould abiding \\n\\n \\n\\n For Heidrik’s daughter \\n\\n \\n\\n Might win healing. \\n\\n \\n\\n All that heard Oddrun, \\n\\n \\n\\n Atil’s sister, \\n\\n \\n\\n How that the damsel \\n\\n \\n\\n Had heavy sickness, \\n\\n \\n\\n So she led from stall \\n\\n \\n\\n Her bridled steed, \\n\\n \\n\\n And on the swart one \\n\\n \\n\\n Laid the saddle. \\n\\n \\n\\n She made her horse wend \\n\\n \\n\\n O’er smooth ways of earth, \\n\\n \\n\\n Until to a high-built \\n\\n \\n\\n Hall she came; \\n\\n \\n\\n Then the saddle she had \\n\\n \\n\\n From the hungry horse, \\n\\n \\n\\n And her ways wended \\n\\n \\n\\n In along the wide hall, \\n\\n \\n\\n And this word first \\n\\n \\n\\n Spake forth therewith: \\n\\n \\n\\n “What is most famed, \\n\\n \\n\\n Afield in Hunland, \\n\\n \\n\\n Or what may be \\n\\n \\n\\n Blithest in Hunland?” \\n\\n \\n\\n QUOTH THE HANDMAID: \\n\\n \\n\\n “Here lieth Borgny, \\n\\n \\n\\n Borne down by trouble, \\n\\n \\n\\n Thy sweet friend, O Oddrun, \\n\\n \\n\\n See to her helping!” \\n\\n \\n\\n ODDRUN SAID: \\n\\n \\n\\n “Who of the lords \\n\\n \\n\\n Hath laid this grief on her, \\n\\n \\n\\n Why is the anguish \\n\\n \\n\\n Of Borgny so weary?” \\n\\n \\n\\n THE HANDMAID SAID: \\n\\n \\n\\n “He is hight Vilmund, \\n\\n \\n\\n Friend of hawk-bearers, \\n\\n \\n\\n He wrapped the damsel \\n\\n \\n\\n In the warm bed-gear \\n\\n \\n\\n Five winters long \\n\\n \\n\\n Without her father’s wotting.” \\n\\n \\n\\n No more than this \\n\\n \\n\\n They spake methinks; \\n\\n \\n\\n Kind sat she down \\n\\n \\n\\n By the damsel’s knee; \\n\\n \\n\\n Mightily sand Oddrun, \\n\\n \\n\\n Sharp piercing songs \\n\\n \\n\\n By Borgny’s side: \\n\\n \\n\\n Till a maid and a boy \\n\\n \\n\\n Might tread on the world’s ways, \\n\\n \\n\\n Blithe babes and sweet \\n\\n \\n\\n Of Hogni’s bane: \\n\\n \\n\\n Then the damsel forewearied \\n\\n \\n\\n The word took up, \\n\\n \\n\\n The first word of all \\n\\n \\n\\n That had won from her: \\n\\n \\n\\n “So may help thee \\n\\n \\n\\n All helpful things, \\n\\n \\n\\n Fey and Freyia, \\n\\n \\n\\n And all the fair Gods, \\n\\n \\n\\n As thou hast thrust \\n\\n \\n\\n This torment from me!” \\n\\n \\n\\n ODDRUN SAID: \\n\\n \\n\\n “Yet no heart had I \\n\\n \\n\\n For thy helping, \\n\\n \\n\\n Since never wert thou \\n\\n \\n\\n Worthy of helping, \\n\\n \\n\\n But my word I held to, \\n\\n \\n\\n That of old was spoken \\n\\n \\n\\n When the high lords \\n\\n \\n\\n Dealt out the heritage, \\n\\n \\n\\n That every soul \\n\\n \\n\\n I would ever help.” \\n\\n \\n\\n BORGNY SAID: \\n\\n \\n\\n “Right mad art thou, Oddrun, \\n\\n \\n\\n And reft of thy wits, \\n\\n \\n\\n Whereas thou speakest \\n\\n \\n\\n Hard words to me \\n\\n \\n\\n Thy fellow ever \\n\\n \\n\\n Upon the earth \\n\\n \\n\\n As of brothers twain, \\n\\n \\n\\n We had been born.” \\n\\n \\n\\n ODDRUN SAID: \\n\\n \\n\\n “Well I mind me yet, \\n\\n \\n\\n What thou saidst that evening, \\n\\n \\n\\n Whenas I bore forth \\n\\n \\n\\n Fair drink for Gunnar; \\n\\n \\n\\n Such a thing, saidst thou, \\n\\n \\n\\n Should fall out never, \\n\\n \\n\\n For any may \\n\\n \\n\\n Save for me alone.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Mind had the damsel \\n\\n \\n\\n Of the weary day \\n\\n \\n\\n Whenas the high lords \\n\\n \\n\\n Dealt out the heritage, \\n\\n \\n\\n And she sat her down, \\n\\n \\n\\n The sorrowful woman, \\n\\n \\n\\n To tell of the bale, \\n\\n \\n\\n And the heavy trouble. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Nourished was I \\n\\n \\n\\n In the hall of kings — \\n\\n \\n\\n Most folk were glad — \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Mid the council of great ones: \\n\\n \\n\\n In fair life lived I, \\n\\n \\n\\n And the wealth of my father \\n\\n \\n\\n For five winters only, \\n\\n \\n\\n While yet he had life. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Such were the last words \\n\\n \\n\\n That ever he spake, \\n\\n \\n\\n The king forewearied, \\n\\n \\n\\n Ere his ways he went; \\n\\n \\n\\n For be bade folk give me \\n\\n \\n\\n The gold red-gleaming, \\n\\n \\n\\n And give me in Southlands \\n\\n \\n\\n To the son of Grimhild. \\n\\n \\n\\n “But Brynhild he bade \\n\\n \\n\\n To the helm to betake her, \\n\\n \\n\\n And said that Death-chooser \\n\\n \\n\\n She should become; \\n\\n \\n\\n And that no better \\n\\n \\n\\n Might ever be born \\n\\n \\n\\n Into the world, \\n\\n \\n\\n If fate would not spoil it. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Brynhild in bower \\n\\n \\n\\n Sewed at her broidery, \\n\\n \\n\\n Folk she had \\n\\n \\n\\n And fair lands about her; \\n\\n \\n\\n Earth lay a-sleeping, \\n\\n \\n\\n Slept the heavens aloft \\n\\n \\n\\n When Fafnir’s-bane \\n\\n \\n\\n The burg first saw. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Then was war waged \\n\\n \\n\\n With the Welsh-wrought sword \\n\\n \\n\\n And the burg all broken \\n\\n \\n\\n That Brynhild owned; \\n\\n \\n\\n Nor wore long space, \\n\\n \\n\\n E’en as well might be, \\n\\n \\n\\n Ere all those wiles \\n\\n \\n\\n Full well she knew. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Hard and dreadful \\n\\n \\n\\n Was the vengeance she drew down, \\n\\n \\n\\n So that all we \\n\\n \\n\\n Have woe enow. \\n\\n \\n\\n Through all lands of the world \\n\\n \\n\\n Shall that story fare forth \\n\\n \\n\\n How she did her to death \\n\\n \\n\\n For the death of Sigurd. \\n\\n \\n\\n “But therewithal Gunnar \\n\\n \\n\\n The gold-scatterer \\n\\n \\n\\n Did I fall to loving \\n\\n \\n\\n And should have loved him. \\n\\n \\n\\n Rings of red gold \\n\\n \\n\\n Would they give to Atli, \\n\\n \\n\\n Would give to my brother \\n\\n \\n\\n Things goodly and great. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Yea, fifteen steads \\n\\n \\n\\n Would they give for me, \\n\\n \\n\\n And the load of Grani \\n\\n \\n\\n To have as a gift; \\n\\n \\n\\n But then spake Atli, \\n\\n \\n\\n That such was his will, \\n\\n \\n\\n Never gift to take \\n\\n \\n\\n From the sons of Giuki. \\n\\n \\n\\n “But we in nowise \\n\\n \\n\\n Might love withstand, \\n\\n \\n\\n And mine head must I lay \\n\\n \\n\\n On my love, the ring-breaker; \\n\\n \\n\\n And many there were \\n\\n \\n\\n Among my kin, \\n\\n \\n\\n Who said that they \\n\\n \\n\\n Had seen us together. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Then Atli said \\n\\n \\n\\n That I surely never \\n\\n \\n\\n Would fall to crime \\n\\n \\n\\n Or shameful folly: \\n\\n \\n\\n But now let no one \\n\\n \\n\\n For any other, \\n\\n \\n\\n That shame deny \\n\\n \\n\\n Where love has dealing. \\n\\n \\n\\n “For Atli sent \\n\\n \\n\\n His serving-folk \\n\\n \\n\\n Wide through the murkwood \\n\\n \\n\\n Proof to win of me, \\n\\n \\n\\n And thither they came \\n\\n \\n\\n Where they ne’er should have come, \\n\\n \\n\\n Where one bed we twain \\n\\n \\n\\n Had dight betwixt us. \\n\\n \\n\\n “To those men had we given \\n\\n \\n\\n Rings of red gold, \\n\\n \\n\\n Naught to tell \\n\\n \\n\\n Thereof to Atli, \\n\\n \\n\\n But straight they hastened \\n\\n \\n\\n Home to the house, \\n\\n \\n\\n And all the tale \\n\\n \\n\\n To Atli told. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Whereas from Gudrun \\n\\n \\n\\n Well they hid it, \\n\\n \\n\\n Though better by half \\n\\n \\n\\n Had she have known it. \\n\\n ***** \\n\\n ***** \\n\\n \\n\\n “Din was there to hear \\n\\n \\n\\n Of the hoofs gold-shod, \\n\\n \\n\\n When into the garth \\n\\n \\n\\n Rode the sons of Giuki. \\n\\n \\n\\n “There from Hogni \\n\\n \\n\\n The heart they cut, \\n\\n \\n\\n But into the worm-close \\n\\n \\n\\n Cast the other. \\n\\n \\n\\n There the king, the wise-hearted, \\n\\n \\n\\n Swept his harp-strings, \\n\\n \\n\\n For the might king \\n\\n \\n\\n Had ever mind \\n\\n \\n\\n That I to his helping \\n\\n \\n\\n Soon should come. \\n\\n \\n\\n “But now was I gone \\n\\n \\n\\n Yet once again \\n\\n \\n\\n Unto Geirmund, \\n\\n \\n\\n Good feast to make;
