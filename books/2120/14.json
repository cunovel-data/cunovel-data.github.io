{"id":93228,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"The Four Hundred Ball, also known as the Patrician Ball, never wavered from the tradition set by its original organizers in the late nineteenth century, when the Blue Bloods first came into prominent position in society. The ten- course meal, with breaks in between for dancing, was set on $75,000-a-piece gold service--solid gold plates, gold flat- ware, and gold-crusted crystal goblets.\n Along the length of the four rectangular tables, with a hundred seats at each, was a pile of sand, and each place setting was set with a golden trowel. Guests were encouraged to \"dig\" for treasure--their parting gifts. The Committee had been able to convince sponsors to provide expensive, eye- popping jewelry set with rubies, sapphires, and diamonds as party favors. The Junior Committee, led by Mimi, had added a modern touch: \"alphabet\" necklaces from Me \u0026 Ro, intricate Peruvian peacock earrings by Zani, and the most coveted piece of the season, Kaviar and Kind\u0027s diamond- encrusted shark-tooth pendant.\n The menu was just the same as it had been on the night of the first Patrician Ball: a first course of Consomm? Olga, then Filet Mignons Lili, Vegetable Marrow Farcie, followed by a roast duckling and sirloin of beef, accompanied by creamed carrots and parmentier potatoes.\n Several towering ice sculptures depicting New York\u0027s greatest monuments and institutions, including the new MOMA building, renovations funded by Blue Blood money, and the proposed Frank Gehry port, championed by none other than Senator Llewellyn himself, were arranged next to the bars that lined the room, and champagne flowed from hidden spigots in the ice.\n Mimi barely touched her food, getting up from her seat to circulate among the glittering crowd. Every prestigious family in New York, all the old names were represented: the Van Horns, the Schlumbergers, the Wagners, the Stewarts, the Howells and the Howlands, the Goulds and the Goelets, the Bancrofts and the Barlows. Members of the clan who had remained in England were represented, as well as several more exotic branches. A vastly rich Blue Blood family who had splintered from the main group centuries ago and settled in what was now modern China had just arrived from Shanghai, a city that they had recently helped rebuild. Their sixteen-year-old twin daughters, two gorgeous long- limbed Chinese socialites, would be among those presented at the ball that evening.\n But there was no family more respected or revered than the Forces. Mimi was a princess among her people, and she walked through them, accepting their admiration, their deference.\n She looked for her brother. He had been by her side all evening but had disappeared between the fish and meat course. By all rights they should be doing this together. Tonight was the night the coven would recognize that they had found each other, and that when the time came, they would be renewing their immortal vows.\n Where was he?\n She cast her mind across the room, looking for his signal. Ah, there he was, by the head table, talking to a friend on the lacrosse team, Bryce Cutting. She saw him stop and look in her direction with a sudden, joyous smile on his face.\n She smiled back and waved at him, but he didn\u0027t return the wave.\n Annoyed, she turned around--maybe he wasn\u0027t looking at her after all?\n And that\u0027s when she noticed who was standing right behind her, at the top of the staircase, commanding the attention of the entire ballroom.\n Schuyler Van Alen.\n In a dress that even Mimi herself would die to wear. Schuyler found her seat next to the dour parents of Aggie Carondolet. It was apparent that the Carondolets had felt slighted by their seating, and they hardly spoke a word to Schuyler except to inform her that they were truly sad about Cordelia. She found Bliss sitting by herself at the front table, and waved to her. Bliss waved back. \"Come over,\" Bliss mouthed.\n She gathered up her gold skirts and walked over to Bliss\u0027s side. The two girls hugged warmly.\n \"Sky, I have to tell you something--about Dylan,\" Bliss said.\n \"Oh?\" Schuyler raised an eyebrow.\n \"I think he\u0027s...\" but before Bliss could finish, a boy walked over and asked her to dance. \"Sure.\" Bliss shrugged. \"I\u0027ll tell you later,\" she said to Schuyler.\n Schuyler nodded. As she dejectedly walked back to her seat, she wondered what Bliss was about to tell her. Bliss was her only friend at the ball. What was Schuyler doing here, anyway? Why had she come? For Cordelia? For the Van Alen name? No. She had to be honest. And this was where the truth hurt. She had wanted to see Jack Force again. But it was agony.\n There he was, attentively at his sister\u0027s side, the two of them gliding through the ballroom, entwined at the hip. Jack keeping a hand on Mimi\u0027s tiny waist. Schuyler had heard whispers from the Elders and the Wardens at the adjoining table...something about a bond...something about the two of them and an immortal vow. The next course was served, roast squab and a cold asparagus vinaigrette. It looked delicious, but the food tasted dry and mealy on her tongue.\n \"Jack,\" Mimi whispered softly in his ear as they made their way around the room. \"It\u0027s time.\" Ever practical, she decided to ignore what she had seen earlier. Mimi was a mas- ter of self-deception. If something bothered her, she refused to even acknowledge its existence. In her mind, Schuyler Van Alen was a temporary, if annoying, infatuation.\n But for Jack, the sight of Schuyler Van Alen had only served to ignite a feeling he had been repressing for months. A disquieting thought nagged at his conscience. Why did Schuyler affect him in such a powerful way? Was it the resemblance to Allegra? Was that all? Or was it something new...something he wasn\u0027t prepared for and didn\u0027t expect? He shook his head, disgusted and ashamed of himself. His rightful place was by his sister\u0027s side. He would just have to act as if Schuyler did not exist.\n \"They are waiting for us to lead the quadrille,\" Mimi said, and Jack dutifully escorted his sister to the dance floor, where three other young couples were waiting. It was part of Four Hundred tradition that the young who were going to be presented would lead in this dance, and the teens in the fore- most quadrille were chosen because of their family\u0027s hierar- chy in The Committee. Aggie Carondolet would have been one of the dancers had she lived.\n Mimi thought the quadrille was just a fancy name for square dancing, but she enjoyed it even so, as Jack led her through the cross-over, the balance, and then the circle eight, ending with the four ladies\u0027 grand chain, which placed her in the front of the group, as it should be.\n After the dance, the Blue Blood teens remained frozen in their position in the middle of the dance floor, waiting to be formally presented to the assembly, called out by their cur- rent and true names by the Regis.\n \"Dehua Chen,\" was called, and one of the imperial Chinese beauties stepped forward.\n \"Known to our people by her true name, Xi Wangmu.\" The Angel of Immortality.\n \"Deming Chen.\" Her sister was called next. The two of them were identical in their serene, otherworldly beauty, with skin the color of toasted milk; silky-straight, ebony- black hair; sexily slanted almond eyes; and an incongruous splattering of freckles across their button noses.\n \"Known to our people by her true name, Kuan Yin.\" The Angel of Mercy.\n Several other Blue Blood teens were called, rounding out the former heavenly pantheon.\n At last, a lone spotlight was shone on the Force twins. Mimi gripped her brother\u0027s hand tightly.\n \"Madeleine Force.\" Mimi stepped forward, her chin held high.\n \"Known to our people by her true name, Azrael.\" The Angel of Death.\n \"Benjamin Force.\" Jack bowed his head.\n \"Known to our people by his true name, Abbadon.\" The Angel of Destruction.\n The twin Angels of the Apocalypse. This was their immortal destiny. This was their place. The clan\u0027s most pow- erful vampires after the Uncorrupted. Lucifer\u0027s former lieu- tenants, who had turned their backs on the Prince of Heaven after the Fall. In Rome, they had hunted and slain the Silver Blood spawn. Only by their strength had the Blue Bloods survived the millennia.\n Jack smiled at Mimi, and they both bowed low to the coven.\n They had their work cut out for them. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/masquerade-blue-bloods-2/page-14.html","bookId":2120,"book":{"id":2120,"title":"Masquerade (Blue Bloods #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Masquerade (Blue Bloods #2) \n Schuyler Van Alen is starting to get more comfortable with her newfound vampire powers, but she still has many unanswered questions.
