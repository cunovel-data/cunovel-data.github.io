{"id":93259,"no":45,"title":"Page 45","content":"Mimi\u0027s condemnation, the formal process for her execution, was coincidentally scheduled during Duchesne\u0027s Ski Week in March, so she allowed herself to pretend the family was just going on vacation to Venice. The whole prospect of what was to come her blood burned, her imminent destruction seemed absolutely ludicrous.\n She believed her father would find some way to rescue her from her fate, and she spent the flight from New York paging through fashion magazines, marking off the clothes she would buy when she returned to the city. But once they arrived in Venice, Mimi\u0027s bravado cracked a little. Especially when members of the Conclave escorted them to their hotel. They had traveled to the ancient prison as well, to witness the final rites.\n It was hard to believe in death and burning in her comfortable bedroom, where she could still watch TiVo\u0027d My Super Sweet Sixteen and Tiara Girls. But stepping foot on the waterlogged sidewalks of Venice seemed to bring the past to life, and her memories screeched with images of the hunt: bringing death to Blue Blood foes, the black robes of the condemnation worn by the corrupted traitors, the screams of the guilty. Mimi shuddered.\n Tradition called for the accused to voluntarily surrender to the jailor, and on the evening of their arrival, Mimi left their hotel and made the historical walk across the Bridge of Sighs, where thousands of Blue Blood prisoners had walked before.\n The bridge was so named because it was the last vantage point from which the condemned could view the city. She walked on it lightly. Jack was at her side, silent and grim. A few paces behind them, Elders and Wardens from the Conclave followed in a procession. Mimi could hear the heavy footsteps from the mens\u0027 boots, and the softer stiletto clack from the ladies\u0027 shoes.\n \"Don\u0027t,\" she said to her brother.\n \"What?\"\n Don\u0027t act like I\u0027m dead already. I, for one, am not giving up.\n She stuck out her chin, defiant and unbowed. \"I\u0027m not worried! They\u0027ll see I\u0027ve been set up!\"\n \"Nothing gets you down, huh?\" Jack asked with a ghost of a smile. He was amused to find his sister as bratty and confident as ever. Her bravery was admirable.\n \"I laugh in the face of death. But then again, I am Death.\"\n They stood in the middle of the bridge, the two of them remembering another walk, another time, in their shared past. A happier memory.\n An idea occurred to Mimi.\n She turned toward her brother. They stood in front of each other, forehead to forehead, as they had all those centuries ago.\n \"I give myself to you,\" she whispered, linking her fingers into his. Those were the sacred words that began the ceremony. That was all the bond entailed. All he would have to do was repeat them back to her, and the bond would be resealed in a new lifetime. In this lifetime.\n Jack held her delicate hands in his. He brought them up to his lips and kissed them passionately, deeply. He closed his eyes and held her trembling fingers, feeling with his mind her love, her desire, her whole soul, waiting on a precipice for his response.\n \"No. Not yet,\" he sighed, keeping their hands linked tightly and opening his eyes so he could look deep into her eyes.\n \"If not now, when?\" she asked, the threat of tears in her voice. She loved him so much. He was hers. She was his. It was the way of their kind. This was their immortal story. \"Time might be running out for me. For us.\"\n \"No,\" Jack promised. \"I would never let that happen.\" He looked away and released his hands from her.\n Mimi crossed her arms, furious, and glanced to see what had distracted him.\n Schuyler Van Alen was walking with her grandfather a few steps behind them. Seriously! Couldn\u0027t the wretched girl leave her in peace? She had won, hadn\u0027t she?\n \"Wait,\" Jack said. \"It\u0027s not what you think. I need to talk to Schuyler.\"\n Mimi watched as Jack walked over to her rival. On the night of her condemnation, couldn\u0027t she even catch a break?\n Schuyler was startled when Jack Force appeared by her side. She had traveled to Venice with Lawrence at her grandfather\u0027s request. The thought of being witness to Mimi Force\u0027s demise wasn\u0027t an experience she was looking forward to, although, like Mimi, she couldn\u0027t quite believe it was truly happening. \"You know about the blood trial,\" Jack said.\n She nodded. \"Yes. My grandfather told me it\u0027s the only way to prove what really happened that night. The only way to overturn a ruling by the Conclave in session.\"\n What Schuyler didn\u0027t say was that Lawrence had told her something else about the blood trial. Her grandfather had briefed her on her mother\u0027s history during their vampire lessons and confided that Gabrielle was the only vampire who was able to do it: as one of the highest-ranking Venators, she could tell blood memory from false.\n \"As Allegra\u0027s daughter, you may have inherited this ability,\" Lawrence had said. \"You may be able to clear Mimi Force.\"\n \"Grandfather,\" Schuyler pleaded, \"I\u0027m not...I can\u0027t...\"\n \"Listen to me closely, the blood trial will mean you will have to drink Mimi\u0027s blood to discover the truth of what happened that night. Only the Uncorrupted have the power to ascertain real memory from false in the blood memory. But it is a great risk: drinking the blood of another vampire means there is a chance you may give in to the temptation that afflicts the Silver Blood, kill Mimi, and become doomed in the process by becoming Abomination yourself. It is a risk only you can decide to take.\"\n \"And if I choose not to?\" Schuyler asked.\n \"Then punishment will be rendered.\"\n The thought that she held Mimi\u0027s life in her hands oppressed Schuyler. To risk her own life to save her enemy\u0027s! How could she volunteer for such a task? She had visited her mother in the hospital for guidance. Allegra slumbered peacefully in her bed.\n \"I don\u0027t know what to do. If I don\u0027t do it, Mimi will die. But If I do, then I could become a monster....Tell me what to do, Mother. Help me.\"\n Yet, as usual, there had been no sign from Allegra.\n And now Jack was studying Schuyler carefully. What did Jack mean by bringing this up now? Shouldn\u0027t he stay by Mimi\u0027s side and help her to accept the inevitable?\n Jack looked over at Lawrence, who was watching the two of them keenly. He returned his gaze to Schuyler. \"You are your mother\u0027s daughter. Only you can perform the blood trial.\"\n She took a step back.\n Lawrence cleared his throat, but held his tongue.\n \"Lawrence, you said so yourself, that Schuyler has powers none of us have. Schuyler, please. I\u0027m begging you.\" Jack said, with tears in his eyes. \"You\u0027re her only chance. They will destroy her.\"\n Suddenly, Schuyler understood what was at stake. This wasn\u0027t a game the Conclave was playing. This wasn\u0027t make-believe or a play put on for their amusement. They had conducted an investigation and pronounced judgment. Punishment had been recorded in the Book of Laws. They had traveled across the ocean to Venice, to the ancient prison, to fulfill the sentence.\n Mimi was going to burn.\n Schuyler looked askance at Jack. Your sister tried to destroy me! She wanted me dead taken by a Silver Blood! How can I...\n But she knew what she had to do. This was the sign she had been seeking all along. She looked deep into Jack\u0027s anxious green eyes.\n \"Okay,\" she said, taking a deep breath. \"I\u0027ll do it.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/masquerade-blue-bloods-2/page-45.html","bookId":2120,"book":{"id":2120,"title":"Masquerade (Blue Bloods #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Masquerade (Blue Bloods #2) \n Schuyler Van Alen is starting to get more comfortable with her newfound vampire powers, but she still has many unanswered questions.
