{"id":93249,"no":35,"title":"Page 35","content":"The Mercer had been Oliver\u0027s idea. He\u0027d nixed Schuyler\u0027s room or his, thinking it would be too weird to do \"it\" in the same place where they had spent so many innocent hours reading magazines and watching television. So he\u0027d booked a suite at the downtown hotel.\n He had convinced her to have a few drinks with him in the library bar before they went up to the room. \"You might not need a drink, but I definitely do,\" he\u0027d said. Schuyler watched patiently as Oliver downed one Manhattan after another. Neither of them said much. The library bar was off-limits to non-hotel guests, and the two of them sat in a private corner. The only other patron was a movie star giving a magazine interview across the room. The movie star had her feet on the couch and she was laughing too loudly, while the reporter looked nervous and starstruck. A small silver recorder sat on the cocktail table between them.\n \"All right, let\u0027s do it,\" Oliver said, pushing away his half- finished third drink.\n \"God, you look like I\u0027ve asked you to go to war,\" Schuyler said, as they walked toward the elevator.\n The one-bedroom suite had a stunning view of downtown, and was decorated with a hip modern edge: dark Makassar ebony furniture, lamb\u0027s wool throw pillows, black epoxy floors polished to a high gloss, an onyx bar that glowed from within, a flat-screen television, and stainless steel walls that looked cold to the touch but actually felt smooth and warm, like butter.\n \"Cool,\" Schuyler said as she sat on one edge of the king- size bed, while Oliver sat on the other.\n \"Are you sure you want to do this?\" Oliver asked, sitting forward and putting his face on his hand.\n \"Ollie, if I don\u0027t, I\u0027ll pass out in a coma and I won\u0027t ever wake up. This morning I couldn\u0027t even get out of bed.\"\n He gulped.\n \"I hate to ask you this--but it\u0027s just, I don\u0027t know, I don\u0027t want my first time to be with someone I don\u0027t even know, you know?\" She\u0027d told him about what had happened to Bliss in Montserrat. \"And you\u0027re my best friend.\"\n \"Sky, you know I\u0027d do anything for you. But this is against the Code. Conduits aren\u0027t allowed to be familiars to their vampires. We are supposed to be objective. It\u0027s not part of the relationship. Things like the Caerimonia, it complicates things, you know,\" Oliver explained. When Schuyler had first asked Oliver a week ago if he would consider becoming her human familiar, he had told her he would think about it. The next day, he hadn\u0027t brought it up, and Schuyler assumed he was too polite to tell her no, so he was just going to act like she\u0027d never asked him at all. Several days went by, and neither of them mentioned it. Schuyler was beginning to think she would have to find an alternate solution. But that morning, she had found an envelope stuffed into her locker. It was from the Mercer Hotel, and held a plastic door key for their suite. \"See you there tonight,\" Oliver had written. \"Chomp! Chomp!\"\n It wasn\u0027t as if Schuyler didn\u0027t have mixed feelings of her own she hated putting Oliver in this position--but she felt she had no choice. If she had to take a familiar, at least she would take one who was, forgive the pun, already familiar to her. And she\u0027d felt drawn to Oliver since Venice. Maybe that was a sign it was going to be all right. That this was something that was supposed to happen.\n \"Just say the word, Ollie, and we won\u0027t do it, okay?\" she offered, her hands gripping the edge of the bed, pulling out the sheets from their corners.\n \"Okay. Let\u0027s not do it,\" he said promptly. He sighed and lay down on the bed, waving his arms over the downy comforter. His long legs dangled from the edge but his torso was totally horizontal. He closed his eyes, as if the prospect was simply too much to bear, and put his hands on his face again, as if to shield himself from something.\n \"Do you mean it?\" Schuyler asked a little fearfully.\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" Oliver groaned behind his hands, which were now folded over his mouth.\n \"It\u0027s just, you know, I\u0027ll be really careful, if you\u0027re scared, I mean. You have to trust me.\" She was still sitting upright so that her words were spoken to the wall of windows, while Oliver seemed to be talking to the ceiling.\n \"I trust you,\" Oliver said in a strained, sad voice. \"I trust you with my life.\"\n \"I know it\u0027ll change our relationship, but we\u0027re best friends. It can\u0027t change that much, can it? I mean, I already love you,\" Schuyler said. Every word she said was true, she was very fond of Oliver. She couldn\u0027t imagine life without him.\n She turned around to look at him. Oliver had removed his hands from his face and opened his eyes. She noticed how his chestnut hair framed his handsome face, and how his neck looked inviting under his stiff Oxford collar. \"Don\u0027t you love me?\" She knew she was being manipulative, but she couldn\u0027t help it. She needed Oliver to say yes. Otherwise...who would she do it with?\n Oliver tried not to blush and couldn\u0027t quite meet Schuyler\u0027s eyes. He lifted himself to a sitting position once again. \"All right,\" he said, almost more to himself than to her.\n Schuyler moved closer to him and leaned against his body, and with a few small movements, she was sitting on his lap. \"Okay?\"\n \"You\u0027re heavy,\" he teased, but he was smiling.\n \"Am not.\"\n \"All right, you\u0027re not.\"\n \"You\u0027re cute, you know? I mean, really cute. Why do you spend all your time with me? You should date,\" she said matter-of- factly as she brushed the hair out of his hazel eyes. They were the kindest eyes she had ever seen, she thought. She would always feel safe with Oliver.\n \"Yeah, me, date.\" Oliver laughed. He put his arms around her waist.\n \"Why not? It\u0027s not unheard of.\"\n \"Yeah?\" Oliver asked.\n \"Uh--\" But Schuyler didn\u0027t finish, because Oliver was putting a warm hand on her chin and drawing her toward him, and soon they were kissing. Soft, tentative kisses that turned more vigorous as they opened their mouths to each other.\n \"Mmm...\" she sighed. So this was what it was like. Kissing Oliver. It wasn\u0027t anything like she\u0027d imagined. It was better. It was as if they were made for each other. Schuyler pressed herself against him, and Oliver put his hand through her hair. This was new. This was a turning point. Then she started kissing his chin and his neck.\n \"Sky...\"\n \"Mmmm?\"\n Suddenly, Oliver pushed her away, took her hands from behind his back, and abruptly shoved her off his lap.\n \"No,\" he said, panting heavily. His cheeks were aflame with embarrassment.\n \"No?\" Schuyler asked, not understanding. It seemed like it was going well--this was what was meant to happen, wasn\u0027t it?\n \"No.\" Oliver stood up and started pacing. \"The Sacred Kiss means something. It did to your mom. And you know what? You\u0027ll have to find another guinea pig. I\u0027m not going to do it out of obligation.\"\n \"Ollie.\"\n \"Don\u0027t, Schuyler.\"\n He never called her Schuyler unless he was really mad. Schuyler shut up.\n \"I\u0027m going. I can\u0027t be with you...You\u0027re not yourself.\"\n Oliver said, putting his coat on and slamming the door of the hotel room as he stormed out into the night. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/masquerade-blue-bloods-2/page-35.html","bookId":2120,"book":{"id":2120,"title":"Masquerade (Blue Bloods #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Masquerade (Blue Bloods #2) \n Schuyler Van Alen is starting to get more comfortable with her newfound vampire powers, but she still has many unanswered questions.
