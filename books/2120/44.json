{"id":93258,"no":44,"title":"Page 44","content":"Allegra Van Alen\u0027s hospital suite was on the top floor of Columbia Presbyterian, in a private wing where the rich and famous convalesced. The room was decorated in a style suited to the city\u0027s best hotels, with white Italian linens on the bed, sumptuous carpeting, and crystal vases filled with fresh flowers. Every day, a team of nurses massaged and manipulated Allegra\u0027s limbs to keep her muscles from the dangers of atrophy. Not that Allegra would ever notice. Once the city\u0027s most celebrated beauty, she slumbered, oblivious to the world around her: a woman with a glorious and tragic past, but no future. The heart monitor next to the bed showed a steady pulse, and for a long time, there was no sound in the room but the steady beeping from the machine. Lawrence Van Alen sat in a chair opposite Allegra\u0027s bed. He had come to visit his daughter for the first time since he had returned. It was a visit he had been postponing due to the emotional weight of seeing his child reduced to such diminished capacity. \"Oh, Gabrielle,\" he said finally. \"How did it come to this?\" \"She can\u0027t hear you,\" Charles Force said as he entered the room, bearing another vase of flowers. He placed it on the sideboard next to her bed. He didn\u0027t seem surprised to find Lawrence there. \"She chooses not to hear,\" Lawrence said. \"You have done this.\" \"I have done nothing. This is her own doing.\" \"Be that as it may, it was still your fault. If you had not--\" \"If I had not saved her, you mean, in Florence? If I had let the beast have her? Then she would not be in a coma? But what was the alternative? To let her die? What was I to do? Tell me, Father.\" \"What you did was against the laws of the universe. It was her time, Michael. It was her time to go.\" \"Do not speak to me of time. You have no idea what happened. You were not there,\" Charles said bitterly. He put a hand on Allegra\u0027s cheek and stroked it gently. \"One day she will awake. She will awake out of love for me.\" \"It is sad that you still do not understand, Michael. She will never love you the way she did before. She herself did not understand the choice you made. You should have let her die. She will never forgive you.\" Charles Force\u0027s shoulders shook. \"Why do you talk to me as if I were still a boy? She only left Heaven out of love for you and Cordelia when you were banished.\" \"Yes. We had been doomed, we who were loyal to Lucifer. But your sister brought us hope. It was her choice to become one of the undead.\" \"Just as it was my choice to follow her.\" Lawrence ruminated on their ancient history. How long ago it seemed now: Lucifer\u0027s ascent to the throne, the Prince of Heaven in all his glory, his bright shining star rising as beautiful as the sun, as powerful as God, or so they had thought, to their own detriment. How they had suffered. The cruel exile from Paradise, and Gabrielle, the Virtuous, who had volunteered to join the ranks of Lucifer\u0027s minions to bring hope and salvation to her kind. She had turned her back on Heaven for love of them, and Michael had followed her out of Paradise because he could not bear to be separated from her. The two of them were called the Uncorrupted because they did not bear the sin of banishment. They had left on their own accord. Out of love and duty. \"So you have won, Lawrence. After all these years, you finally have what you want. The coven.\" The White Vote had been called that morning, and Lawrence had been installed as Regis in an almost unanimous election. Charles had been stripped of his title and responsibilities immediately. His reputation had been badly tainted by Mimi\u0027s conviction. He had tendered his resignation from the Conclave as soon as the news had been announced. \"I never wanted to displace you, Charles. I only wanted us to be safe.\" \"Safe? No one is safe. All you will do is sow fear and weakness. You will have us retreat once again. Back to the shadows. Back to the darkness, where we will hide like animals.\" \"Not a retreat, a tactical exercise in which we will be able to prepare. Because war is coming, and there is nothing you can do to stop it this time. The Silver Bloods are ascendant and the future of this world will be decided once and for all.\" Charles Force remained silent. He walked toward the window and looked out at the Hudson river. A slow barge moved across the surface, and a seagull honked its lonely cry. \"But I have hope. It is said that Allegra\u0027s daughter will defeat the Silver Bloods. I believe Schuyler will bring us the salvation we seek,\" Lawrence said. \"She is almost as powerful as her mother.\" He told Charles of Schuyler\u0027s astonishing abilities. \"And one day she will be even more powerful.\" \"Schuyler Van Alen...the half-blood?\" Charles mused. \"Are you certain that she is the one?\" Lawrence nodded. \"Because Allegra had two daughters,\" Charles said in a light, almost playful tone. \"Surely, even you have not forgotten that.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/masquerade-blue-bloods-2/page-44.html","bookId":2120,"book":{"id":2120,"title":"Masquerade (Blue Bloods #2)","description":"Storyline: Masquerade (Blue Bloods #2) Schuyler Van Alen is starting to get more comfortable with her newfound vampire powers, but she still has many unanswered questions.
