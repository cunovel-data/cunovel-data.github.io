Could everyone please calm down?\n Somehow, in less than twenty-four hours, the news that the fabulous Mimi Force was planning an after-party to the Four Hundred Ball had gone out to the entire New York City teen vampire elite. Of course, Mimi herself had told Piper Crandall, the biggest gossip in the school, and Piper had made sure everyone knew exactly what was going down. There was a secret location. The Force twins were hosting. But no one would know if they were invited until the night of the event. Sheer social torture!\n Just say Y or N!!!\n She deleted the text without replying.\n Mimi walked down the back staircase at Duchesne that led to the cafeteria in the basement. As she passed by, several Blue Blood teens tried to capture her attention.\n \"Mims...heard about the after-party...Great idea, do you need any help? My dad can get Kanye to DJ,\" offered Blair McMillan, whose father headed the largest record label in the world.\n \"Hey, Mimi, I\u0027m invited, right? Can I bring my boyfriend? He\u0027s an RB...Is that cool?\" Soos Kemble wheedled.\n \"Hey, sweetie, just making sure you got my RSVP...\" Lucy Forbes called out, blowing Mimi an exaggerated air kiss.\n Mimi smiled graciously at all of them and put a finger to her lips. \"I can\u0027t say anything about anything. But you\u0027ll all find out soon enough.\"\n Downstairs in the cafeteria, underneath the gold baroque mirror that hung across from the fireplace, Bliss Llewellyn picked listlessly at her sushi roll, as if it were a particularly distasteful specimen. Mimi was supposed to meet her for lunch, and she was late as usual. Bliss was glad of the reprieve, since it gave her a chance to lose herself in the events of the night before.\n Dylan. It had to be him. The stranger in the park who had saved her from drowning. Bliss had to believe he had survived the Silver Blood attack. Perhaps he was now in hiding, and maybe he would be in danger if he revealed his identity. Like a superhero, she thought dreamily. Who else would have sensed her distress? \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/masquerade-blue-bloods-2/page-5.html","bookId":2120,"book":{"id":2120,"title":"Masquerade (Blue Bloods #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Masquerade (Blue Bloods #2) \n Schuyler Van Alen is starting to get more comfortable with her newfound vampire powers, but she still has many unanswered questions.
