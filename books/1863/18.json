{"id":82099,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"Jez heard herself scream, but only faintly.\\n\\n There was a roaring in her ears as if the BART train was coming at her again. And a pain that engulfed\\n\\n her whole body, sending agonized spasms through her limbs. It centered in her chest, though, where\\n\\n something white-hot was lodged inside her, crushing her lung and dislodging her internal organs and\\n\\n burning right beside her heart.\\n\\n She\u0027d been staked.\\n\\n What she had done so often to others had been done to her.\\n\\n She hadn\u0027t realized anything could hurt like this. She was glad none of her victims had lived long to keep\\n\\n suffering.\\n\\n The wood of the stake was poisoning her heart, she knew. Even if it were removed, she would die.\\n\\n No vampire could survive contact between living wood and its undead heart.\\n\\n Still, she would live for a little while-in unimaginable agony as the poison ate through her.\\n\\n A voice was screaming in her mind. Jez-JezJezJez... Over and over, incoherently.\\n\\n Morgead, she thought. And she hoped he wasn\u0027t feeling any of what she was feeling through the silver\\n\\n cord that connected them.\\n\\n Hugh and Claire were sobbing. Jez wished they wouldn\u0027t. They had to stay calm; to think of a way to\\n\\n save themselves.\\n\\n Because she couldn\u0027t help them anymore.\\n\\n Over the sobbing she heard a shrill and angry voice. Lily.\\n\\n \"What is wrong with you?\" Lily was saying. \"Don\u0027t you see what\u0027s happening to her? Don\u0027t you want to save her?\"\\n\\n Through the red haze that filled Jez\u0027s vision, she felt dim approval. They were doing what she\u0027d told\\n\\n them. Whichever of them was the Wild Power was suppressing it\\n\\n Good. That was what mattered. Although she couldn\u0027t really remember why any longer....\\n\\n Suddenly a face broke through the red haze. It was Lily, bending over her.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you understand?\" Lily yelled. \"You can stop this right now. Ill have him kill you cleanly-all the pain\\n\\n will be over. All you have to do is tell me who it is.\"\\n\\n Jez smiled at her faintly. She couldn\u0027t breathe to answer, and she didn\u0027t want to try.\\n\\n Would you believe that I don\u0027t know? she thought. No, I don\u0027t think you would. ...\\n\\n The pain was getting less by itself. It was as if Jez was moving farther and farther away from it.\\n\\n \"How can you be so stupid?\" Lily was screaming. Her face was twisted, and to Jez\u0027s vision, floating in a\\n\\n scarlet mist. She looked like a monster. Then she turned and seemed to be screaming at someone else.\\n\\n \"All right. Get the other vampire down here, too. Morgead.\" She was looking at Jez again. \"We\u0027ll just\\n\\n have to stake your friends one after another until the Wild Power decides to reveal itself.\"\\n\\n No. No...\\n\\n Suddenly everything was much clearer around Jez. She could see the room again, and she could feel her\\n\\n own body. There was still the roaring in her ears, but she could hear Claire\u0027s sobs over it.\\n\\n No. Lily couldn\u0027t mean it. This couldn\u0027t be happening....\\n\\n But it was. They were shoving Morgead down on the floor beside her, and Claire and Hugh beyond\\n\\n him. The thugs with spears were getting into position.\\n\\n No. No. This can\u0027t happen.\\n\\n Jez wanted to scream at them, to tell the Wild Power to do something, because everything was lost now\\n\\n anyway. But she didn\u0027t have air to scream. And she felt so adrift and confused anyway.... Her universe\\n\\n had become disjointed. Her thoughts seemed to be unraveling at all once, past memories combining with\\n\\n flashing sensory impressions from the present, and with strange new ideas....\\n\\n If it was involuntary, why didn\u0027t the Wild Power work magic more often? Unless there was some other\\n\\n requirement....\\n\\n I can\u0027t let this happen.\\n\\n The dampness of blood spreading around her heart. ...\\n\\n Claire\u0027s nails digging into her arms.\\n\\n \"When there\u0027s no physical way to escape ...\"\\n\\n Power in the blood.\\n\\n Claire on the floor there. Screaming and screaming...\\n\\n Something building inside her, hotter than the stake.\\n\\n Morgead beside her whispering, \"Jez, I love you.\"\\n\\n Pierce with the stake over him. Morgead looking up unafraid....\\n\\n Hotter than the heart of a star.\\n\\n Hugh in the distance saying almost quietly, \"Goddess of Life, receive us; guide us to the other world. . .\\n\\n .\"\\n\\n Hotter than the sun and colder and bluer than the moon, like fire that burned and froze and crackled like\\n\\n lightning all at once. Something that filled her with an energy that was past rage and past love and past all\\n\\n controlling and that she recognized in her soul even though she\u0027d never consciously felt it before. It was\\n\\n swelling Jez to bursting, a pure and terrible flame that was never meant to be unleashed like this....\\n\\n \"Do it!\" Lily shouted.\\n\\n And Jez let it free.\\n\\n It came roaring out from her in a silent explosion. Blue fire that streamed from her body and blasted in all\\n\\n directions, but especially up. It came out and out and out, engulfing everything, flowing from her in a\\n\\n never ending torrent. Like a solar flare that didn\u0027t stop.\\n\\n It was all she could see. Blue flames, streaked with blue-white lightning that crackled almost soundlessly.\\n\\n Just like the fire that had cocooned her on the BART tracks.\\n\\n Except that now she could tell where it was coming from, even if she couldn\u0027t direct it. She knew how to\\n\\n let it out, now, but once out it did what it wanted.\\n\\n And it wasn\u0027t meant to be used this way. That was the only thing she knew clearly about it. She\u0027d been\\n\\n letting it slip out when she was desperately upset-when she was worried for someone\u0027s life, and she knew\\n\\n that she couldn\u0027t do anything else to save them. That was forgivable, because it had been unconscious.\\n\\n This wasn\u0027t. She was probably violating some law of the universe or something. The blue fire was only\\n\\n meant to be used in the last battle, when the darkness came and the Four were called to stand against it.\\n\\n I suppose that means I should try to stop now, Jez thought.\\n\\n She wasn\u0027t sure how to do it. She guessed that she needed to call it back, somehow, to draw it down\\n\\n into her body again.\\n\\n Maybe if I sort of tug....\\n\\n She did-something. A gathering-up with her mind. It was harder than letting the fire go had been, but it\\n\\n worked. She could feel it returning, flooding back inside her, as if she were sucking it in. ...\\n\\n And then it was gone, and Jez could see the world again. Could see what it had done.\\n\\n The house had disappeared.\\n\\n Or most of it, anyway. There was about a foot and a half of ragged wall left all around, with charred\\n\\n insulation spilling out. Blue energy like electricity ran along the edges here and there, fizzing.\\n\\n Other than that, no house. Not even chunks of wreckage lying around. There were fine bits of debris\\n\\n floating down, making the sunlight hazy, but that was all.\\n\\n It got... vaporized, Jez thought, searching for the right word.\\n\\n No Lily. No Azarius. No Pierce. And none of the ugly thugs.\\n\\n Goddess, Jez thought. I didn\u0027t mean to do that. I only wanted to stop them from hurting Morgead and\\n\\n Claire and Hugh. ...\\n\\n What about them? she thought in a sudden panic. She turned her head, painfully.\\n\\n They were there. And alive. They were even stirring. The cords they\u0027d been tied with were lying on the\\n\\n carpet, sizzling with that same blue energy.\\n\\n It\u0027s so weird to have a carpet without a house to go with it, Jez thought fuzzily.\\n\\n She was going away again. And that was too bad, but at least it didn\u0027t hurt anymore. The pain was gone\\n\\n completely, replaced by a warm and sleepy feeling-and the sensation of gently floating outward.\\n\\n Her eyelids felt heavy.\\n\\n \"Jez? Jez!\"\\n\\n It was a husky whisper. Jez opened her eyes to see Morgead\u0027s face.\\n\\n He was crying. Oh, dear, that was bad. Jez hadn\u0027t seen him cry since... when was it? Sometime when\\n\\n they\u0027d been little kids....\\n\\n Jez, can you hear me? Now he was talking in her mind.\\n\\n Jez blinked again, and tried to think of something comforting to say to him.\\n\\n \"I feel warm,\" she whispered.\\n\\n \"No, you don\u0027t!\" He said it almost in a growl. Then he looked behind him, and Jez saw Hugh and Claire\\n\\n crawling up. They were all shining with golden light.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re so pretty,\" she told them. \"Like angels.\"\\n\\n \"This isn\u0027t the time for your weird humor!\" Morgead shouted.\\n\\n \"Stop it! Don\u0027t yell at her!\" That was Claire. Claire was crying, too, lovely tears that shone as they fell.\\n\\n She reached out and took Jez\u0027s hand, and that was nice, although Jez couldn\u0027t exactly feel it. She could\\n\\n see it.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s going to be all right,\" Morgead was snarling. \"She\u0027s lost blood, but she\u0027ll be okay.\"\\n\\n Someone was stroking Jez\u0027s hair off her face. She felt that; it was pleasant. She frowned slowly at\\n\\n Morgead, because there was something important to tell him, and talking was difficult.\\n\\n \"Tell Hugh...\" she whispered.\\n\\n \"Tell Hugh your freaking self! He\u0027s right here! And you\u0027re not going anywhere.\"\\n\\n Jez blinked with the difficulty changing focus. Yes, there was Hugh. He was the one stroking her hair.\\n\\n \"Hugh... the prophecy. I figured out what the two eyes watching were. They\u0027re the sun and the\\n\\n moon-get it? Two eyes... for somebody who belongs to both worlds.\"\\n\\n \"The Day World and the Night World,\" Hugh said softly. \"You got it, Jez. That was so smart.\"\\n\\n \"And blood,\" Jez whispered. \u0027\"Power in the blood\u0027-that\u0027s why I couldn\u0027t do it anytime I wanted. Blood\\n\\n has to flow before you can let out the power. The first two times Claire was scratching me. And this time\\n\\n . . .\" Her voice died off, but it wasn\u0027t important. Everybody could see the blood this time, she knew.\\n\\n Hugh\u0027s voice was thick. \"That was smart, too, Jez. You figured it out. And you saved us. You did\\n\\n everything just right.\"\\n\\n \"No... because there\u0027s only going to be three Wild Powers now....\"\\n\\n \"No, there aren\u0027t,\" Morgead raged. \"Listen to me, Jez. There\u0027s no reason for you to die-\"\\n\\n Jez couldn\u0027t manage a smile anymore, or a sentence. But she whispered gently, \"Wood... poison.\"\\n\\n \"No, it isn\u0027t! Not to humans. And you\u0027re half human, Jez. You\u0027re vampire enough to survive something\\n\\n that would kill a human, but you\u0027re human enough not to be poisoned by wood.\"\\n\\n Jez knew better. She couldn\u0027t see much anymore. Only Morgead, and he was getting indistinct. It wasn\u0027t\\n\\n that the world was dimming, though-it was getting brighter. Everything was golden and shining.\\n\\n Four less one and darkness triumphs, Jez thought I\u0027m so sorry about that. I hope they can manage it\\n\\n somehow. It would be so sad for everything human to be lost. There\u0027s so much good in the world, and so\\n\\n much to love....\\n\\n She couldn\u0027t even see Morgead now. Only gold. But she could hear. She could hear Claire whispering\\n\\n to her in a voice broken by tears, and feel wetness dropping on her face.\\n\\n \"I love you, Jez. You\u0027re the best cousin anybody could ever have.\"\\n\\n And Hugh. He was crying, too. \"Jez, I\u0027m so proud to be your friend....\"\\n\\n And then, through the mist and the gold and the warmth and peace, came a voice that wasn\u0027t gentle at\\n\\n all. That was roaring in sheer outrage and fury.\\n\\n \"DONT YOU DARE DIE ON ME, JEZEBEL! DON\u0027T YOU DARE! Or I\u0027ll follow you to the next\\n\\n world and KILL you.\"\\n\\n Suddenly, in the pretty gold mist, she could see something else. The only thing in the universe that wasn\u0027t\\n\\n It was a silver cord.\\n\\n \"You come back and you do it right now,\" Morgead bellowed in her ears and in her mind. \"Right now!\\n\\n Do you hear me?\"\\n\\n The peace was shattered. Nothing seemed quite so warm and wonderful anymore, and she knew that\\n\\n once Morgead got into one of his Excited States, he wouldn\u0027t stop yelling until he got what he wanted.\\n\\n And there was the cord right in front of her. It was strong, and she could feel that the other end was\\n\\n somewhere in. Morgead\u0027s heart, and that he was trying to drag her back to him.\\n\\n All right. Maybe if I just grab on....\\n\\n Somehow, she was holding on to it, and bit by bit, pulling herself back. And then the golden light was\\n\\n fading and she was inside a body that hurt and Morgead was holding her and kissing her and crying all at\\n\\n the same time.\\n\\n Claire\u0027s voice came from beyond him. \"She\u0027s breathing again! She\u0027s breathing!\"\\n\\n \"I love you, you stupid human,\" Morgead gasped against Jez\u0027s cheek. \"I can\u0027t live without you. Don\u0027t you\\n\\n know that?\"\\n\\n Jez whispered, \"I told you never to call me Jezebel.\"\\n\\n Then she fainted.\\n\\n \"Time for a nice bath,\" the nurse said. \"And then we can have a visitor.\"\\n\\n Jez eyed her narrowly. The woman was kind, but she had some mania for sponge baths, and she was\\n\\n always putting strange-smelling ingredients in the water. Which was actually not that surprising since she\\n\\n was a witch.\\n\\n \"Skip the bath,\" Jez said. \"Let the visitor in.\"\\n\\n \"Now, now,\" the witch said, shaking a finger and advancing with the sponge.\\n\\n Jez sighed. Being a Wild Power in a Circle Daybreak sanctuary meant that she could have pretty much\\n\\n anything she wanted-except that everyone was still treating her like a little kid. Especially the nurses, who\\n\\n spoiled her and flattered her, but talked to her as if she were about three.\\n\\n Still, she was glad to let the Circle take care of some things. Keeping her relatives safe, for instance.\\n\\n Although she was almost fully recovered, thanks to a strong constitution and a lot of healing spells from\\n\\n the witches, she wasn\u0027t up to that yet. Uncle Bracken and the entire Goddard family needed constant\\n\\n protection, since Hunter Redfern and the Night World Council were all undoubtedly after them by now.\\n\\n The Circle had imported some experts from back East to take care of it. A rival vampire hunter, of all\\n\\n things, named Rashel something. Plus her soulmate, a vampire-turned-Daybreaker called Quinn.\\n\\n At least they were competent. They\u0027d gotten Jez\u0027s uncle Bracken, as well as the remnants of the gang out\\n\\n of San Francisco, a city that was going to be bad for their health for a while. Morgead was trying to get\\n\\n the gang to join Circle Daybreak for their\\n\\n own good, and he said that Raven, at least, was showing some interest. Val and Thistle were being\\n\\n stubborn, but that was hardly surprising. What was important was that they were alive.\\n\\n Pierce, on the other hand, was simply gone. No one had seen a trace of him or Lily or any of her people\\n\\n since Jez blasted them. Apparently they had truly been vaporized, and Jez couldn\u0027t bring herself to feel\\n\\n too badly.\\n\\n \"All done!\" the nurse said brightly, straightening Jez\u0027s pajama top. Which was just as well because at that\\n\\n moment a black head came poking in the door.\\n\\n \"What is going on in here? You getting ready to go to the opera or something?\"\\n\\n Jez raised her eyebrows at Morgead. \"Maybe. Are you telling me I can\u0027t?\"\\n\\n He snorted and came in as the nurse went out \"I wouldn\u0027t dare tell you that. You\u0027re the princess, right?\\n\\n You can have anything.\u0027\u0027\\n\\n \"Right,\" Jez said, with huge satisfaction. \"So how*re Hugh and Claire?\"\\n\\n \"Claire\u0027s fine; she fits right in with the witches here. I think she\u0027s trying to get them to put up a Web page.\\n\\n And Hugh\u0027s just his same stupid self. He\u0027s off saving chipmunks from toxic waste or something.\"\\n\\n \"And how about the kid?\"\\n\\n \"The kid,\" Morgead said, \"is living it up. The Day-breakers are crazy about her; something about one of\\n\\n the oldest Old Souls ever found:-I dunno. Anyway,\\n\\n they\u0027re trying to talk her mom into letting her live here. She says thanks for saving her life and she\u0027s\\n\\n drawing you a picture.\"\\n\\n Jez nodded, pleased. It would be nice if Iona came to live at the sanctuary; it meant Jez could see her a\\n\\n lot. Not that Jez planned to live here all the time herself-she and Morgead needed their freedom. They\\n\\n couldn\u0027t be penned in; they had to be able to come and go. She just hadn\u0027t gotten around to telling the\\n\\n Daybreakers that yet.\\n\\n With the people she loved taken care of, she could turn her attention to other matters. \"Is that\\n\\n chocolate?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s the only reason you like to see me, isn\u0027t it?\" Morgead said, allowing her to take the box. He sat\\n\\n beside her, looking tragic.\\n\\n \"Nah,\" Jez said with her mouth full. She swallowed. \"Everybody brings \u0027em.\" Then she grinned. \"I like to\\n\\n see you for a different reason.\"\\n\\n He grinned wickedly back. \"I can\u0027t think what that could be.\"\\n\\n \"Hmm... you\u0027re right... maybe there is no other reason.\"\\n\\n \"Watch it, Jezebel,\" he growled and leaned forward menacingly.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t call me that, idiot.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re the idiot, idiot.\"\\n\\n \"And you\u0027re-\" But Jez never got to finish, because he stopped her mouth with a kiss.\\n\\n And then his arms were around her-so gently- and the silver cord was humming and everything was\\n\\n warm and there were only the two of them in the world.\\n\\n One from the land of kings long forgotten; One from the hearth which still holds the spark; One from the\\n\\n Day World where two eyes are watching; One from the twilight to be one with the dark.\\n\\n [The End] \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-huntress-night-world-7/page-18.html","bookId":1863,"book":{"id":1863,"title":"Night World : Huntress (Night World #7)","description":"Storyline: Huntress (Night World Book 7) \\n Jez Redfern is unique.
