Her uncle was sitting there at his desk, surrounded by built-in bookcases. He looked up in surprise. \"Uncle Bracken, who was my mother? How did my parents die?\" It all came out in a single rush of breath. And then Jez wanted to say, \"Tell me the truth,\" but instead she heard herself saving wildly, \"Tell me it\u0027s not true. It\u0027s not possible, is it? Uncle Bracken, I\u0027m so scared.\" Her uncle stared at her for a moment. There was shock and despair in his face. Then he bent his head and shut his eyes. \"But how is it possible?\" Jez whispered. \"How am I here?\" It was hours later. Dawn was tinting the window. She was sitting on the floor, back against a bookcase, where she\u0027d collapsed, staring emptily into the distance. \"You mean, how can a vampire-human halfbreed exist? I don\u0027t know. Your parents never knew. They never expected to have children.\" Uncle Bracken ran both hands through his hair, head down. \"They didn\u0027t even realize you could live as a vampire. Your father brought you to me because he was dying and I was the only person he could trust. He knew I wouldn\u0027t turn you over to the Night World elders.\" \"Maybe you should have,\" Jez whispered. Uncle Bracken went on as if he hadn\u0027t heard her. \"You lived without blood then. You looked like a human child. I don\u0027t know what made me try to see if you could learn how to feed. I brought you a rabbit and bit it for you and let you smell the blood.\" He gave a short laugh of reminiscence. \"And your little teeth sharpened right up and you knew what to do. That was when I knew you were a true Redfern.\" \"But I\u0027m not.\" Jez heard the words as if someone else was speaking them from a distance. \"I\u0027m not even a Night Person. I\u0027m vermin.\" Uncle Bracken let go of his hair and looked at her. His eyes, normally the same silvery-blue as Jez\u0027s, were burning with a pure silver flame. \"Your mother was a good woman,\" he said harshly. \"Your father gave up everything to be with her. She wasn\u0027t vermin.\" Jez looked away, but she wasn\u0027t ashamed. She was numb. She felt nothing except a vast emptiness inside her, stretching infinitely in all directions. And that was good. She never wanted to feel again. Everything she\u0027d felt in her life-everything she could remember-had been a lie. She wasn\u0027t a huntress, a predator fulfilling her place in the scheme of things by chasing down her lawful prey. She was a murderer. She was a monster. \"I can\u0027t stay here anymore,\" she said. Uncle Bracken winced. \"Where will you go?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" He let out his breath and spoke slowly and sadly. \"I have an idea.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-huntress-night-world-7/page-3.html","bookId":1863,"book":{"id":1863,"title":"Night World : Huntress (Night World #7)","description":"Storyline: Huntress (Night World Book 7) Jez Redfern is unique.
