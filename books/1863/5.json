{"id":82086,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"The boy\u0027s light hair was longish, falling over his forehead in disarray. He had a nice face, serious, but\n with an unexpected dimple in his chin that gave him a slightly mischievous look. His body was nicely\n muscled but compact; standing, Jez knew, he\u0027d be no taller than she. There was a large bump coming up\n on his forehead, just under the falling hair. The ghoul had probably slammed him against something.\n Jez jumped up and got a blue plastic cup full of water from her nightstand. She grabbed a clean T-shirt\n from the floor and dipped it into the water, then she gently brushed back the hair from the boy\u0027s\n forehead.\n It was silky under her fingers. Even softer than she would have thought. Jez kept her face expressionless\n and began to wipe his face with the damp cloth.\n He didn\u0027t stir. Jez\u0027s heart, which was already thumping distinctly, speeded up. She took a deep breath\n and kept wiping.\n Finally, although it probably didn\u0027t have anything to do with the water, the boy\u0027s dark eyelashes moved.\n He coughed, breathed, blinked, and looked at her.\n Relief spread through Jez. \"Don\u0027t try to sit up yet.\"\n \"That\u0027s what they all say,\" he agreed, and sat up. He put a hand to his head and groaned. Jez steadied\n him.\n \"I\u0027m fine,\" he said. \"Just tell the room to stop moving.\" He looked around the room, bunked again and\n suddenly seemed to focus. He grabbed her arm, his eyes wide. \"Something followed me-\"\n \"A ghoul. It\u0027s dead.\"\n He let out his breath. Then he smiled wryly. \"You saved my life.\"\n \"And I don\u0027t even charge,\" Jez said, embarrassed.\n \"No, I mean it.\" His smile faded and he looked straight at her. \"Thank you.\"\n Jez could feel heat trying to rise to her face, and she had a hard time holding his gaze. His eyes were\n gray and so intense-fathomless. Her skin was tingling.\n She looked away and said evenly, \"We should get you to a hospital. You might have a concussion.\"\n \"No. I\u0027m okay. Let me just see if I can stand up.\"\n When she opened her mouth to protest, he added, \"Jez, you don\u0027t know why I\u0027m here. It can\u0027t wait.\"\n He was right; Jez had been so intent on getting him conscious that she hadn\u0027t even wondered what he\n was doing here. She looked at him for a moment, then nodded. She helped him up, and let go of his arm\n when she saw he could stand without falling over.\n \"See, I\u0027m fine.\" He took a few steps, then made a circuit of the room, loosening his muscles. Jez watched\n him narrowly, ready to grab him if he fell. But he walked steadily except for a slight limp.\n And that wasn\u0027t from his encounter with the ghoul tonight, Jez knew. He\u0027d had the limp from childhood,\n from when the werewolves took his family.\n How he\u0027d been able to get over that and join Circle Daybreak, Jez would never know.\n He\u0027d lost his parents almost as young as she had. He\u0027d lost his two sisters and his brother, too. His entire\n family had been on a camping trip atLake Tahoe , when in the middle of the night they\u0027d been attacked\n by a pack of werewolves. Renegade \u0027wolves, hunting illegally because Night World law wouldn\u0027t let them\n kill as often as they liked.\n Just like Jez\u0027s old gang.\n The \u0027wolves had ripped through theDavis family\u0027s tents and killed the humans, one, two, three. Easy as\n that. The only one they left alive was seven-year-old Hugh, because he was too little to have much meat\n on his body. They had just settled down to eat the hearts and livers of their victims, when\n suddenly the one too little to be worth eating was dashing at them with a homemade torch constructed of\n kerosene-soaked underwear wrapped around a stick. He was also waving a silver cross on a chain the\n werewolves had torn from his sister\u0027s neck.\n Two things werewolves don\u0027t like: silver and fire. The little boy was attacking with both. The \u0027wolves\n decided to kill him.\n Slowly.\n They almost did it. They managed to chew one of his legs almost off before a park ranger arrived,\n attracted by the spreading fire from the dropped torch.\n The ranger had a gun, and the fire was getting out of control. The \u0027wolves left.\n Hugh almost died of blood loss on the way to the hospital.\n But he was a tough kid. And a very smart one. He didn\u0027t even try to explain to anybody what he\u0027d been\n doing with the silver necklace. He knew they would never believe him if he said he\u0027d suddenly\n remembered a bunch of past lives, including one where he\u0027d seen a werewolf killed.\n Hugh Davis was an Old Soul.\n And a wakened Old Soul, which was even more rare. It scared Jez a little. He was human and she was\n from the Night World, but she didn\u0027t pretend to understand the magic that brought some humans back\n again and again, reincarnating them in new bodies. Letting them remember all their past lifetimes, making\n them smarter and more clearheaded every time they were born.\n In Hugh\u0027s case, also gentler every time. In spite of the attack on his family, when he got out of the\n hospital the first thing he did was try to find some Night People. He knew they weren\u0027t all bad. He knew\n some of them would help him stop the werewolves from hurting anyone else.\n Fortunately, the first people he found were from Circle Daybreak.\n Circles were witch organizations, but Circle Daybreak was for humans and vampires and shapeshifters\n and werewolves, too. It was an underground society, as secret within the Night World as the Night\n World was secret within the human world. It went against the most basic tenets of Night World law: that\n humans were not to be told about the Night World, and that Night People shouldn\u0027t fall in love with\n humans. Circle Daybreak was fighting to unite everybody, to stop the killings, and to bring peace\n between the races.\n Jez wished them luck.\n She suddenly realized that Hugh had stopped walking and was looking at her. She blinked and focused,\n furious with herself for her slip in concentration. As a huntress-of vampires or anything else-you stayed\n alert all the time, or you were dead.\n \"You were miles away,\" Hugh said softly. His gray eyes were calm but intense as always. That look Old\n Souls get when they\u0027re reading you, Jez thought.\n She said, \"Sorry. Um, do you want some ice for that bump?\"\n \"No, I like it. I\u0027m thinking of getting one on the other side, to match.\" He sat on the bed, serious again.\n \"Really, I\u0027ve got some stuff to explain to you, and it\u0027s going to take a while.\"\n Jez didn\u0027t sit. \"Hugh, I think you need it. And I need to take a shower or my aunt will get suspicious\n about what I\u0027m doing in here for so long. Besides, the smell is driving me crazy.\" Although she couldn\u0027t\n use her vampire powers without bringing on the bloodlust, her senses were still much more acute than a\n human\u0027s.\n \"Eau de Ghoul? And I was just starting to enjoy it.\" Hugh nodded at her, switching from gentle humor to\n gentle gravity as always. \"You need to do what will keep your cover here. I shouldn\u0027t be so impatient.\"\n Jez took the fastest shower of her life, then dressed in clean clothes she\u0027d brought to the bathroom. As\n she returned carrying a glassful of ice from the kitchen and a washcloth, she saw that Claire\u0027s bedroom\n door was ajar and Claire was watching her narrowly.\n Jez raised the glass in a mock toast, and slipped into her own bedroom.\n \"Here.\" She made an ice pack and handed it to Hugh. He accepted it docilely. \"Now, what is it that\u0027s so\n urgent? And how come you\u0027re so popular with ghouls all of a sudden?\"\n Instead of answering, Hugh looked into a middle distance. He was bracing himself for something. Finally\n he lowered the ice pack and looked straight at her.\n \"You know I care about you. If anything happened to you, I don\u0027t know what I\u0027d do. And if anything\n happened because of me...\" He shook his head.\n Jez told her heart to get down where it belonged. It was pounding in her throat, choking her. She kept\n her voice flat as she said, \"Thanks.\"\n Something like hurt flashed in his eyes and was gone instantly. \"You don\u0027t think I mean it.\"\n Jez still spoke flatly, in a clipped, hurried voice. She wasn\u0027t good at talking about emotional stuff. \"Hugh,\n look. You were my first human friend. When I came to live here, nobody at Circle Daybreak would have\n anything to do with me. I don\u0027t blame them-not after the things my gang did to humans. But it was hard\n because they wouldn\u0027t even talk to me, much less trust me, and they wouldn\u0027t believe I wanted to help\n them. And then you showed up that day after school. And you did talk to me-\"\n \"And I did trust you,\" Hugh said. \"And I still do.\" He looked distant again. \"I thought you were the\n saddest person I\u0027d ever seen, and the most beautiful-and the bravest. I knew you wouldn\u0027t betray Circle\n Daybreak.\"\n And that\u0027s why I love you, Jez thought before she could stop herself. It was easier to live with if she\n didn\u0027t put it into words.\n Because it was hopeless, of course. You couldn\u0027t hang on to an Old Soul. Nobody could-not unless\n they were one of those tiny fraction of people who were soulmates. Wakened Old Souls were too...\n old. They knew too much, had seen too much to get attached to any one person.\n Much less a person who was tainted with vampire blood.\n So all she said was \"I know. That\u0027s why I work with Circle Daybreak. Because you convinced them I\n wasn\u0027t some kind of spy for the Night World. I owe you, Hugh. And-I believe you care about me.\"\n Because you care about everybody, she added silently.\n Hugh nodded, but he didn\u0027t look any happier. \"It\u0027s about something dangerous. Something I don\u0027t want\n to ask you to do.\" He dug into his jeans pocket and came up with a thick packet of what looked like\n folded newspaper articles. He held it out to her.\n Jez took it, frowned, then paged through the first few articles. Headlines jumped out at her.\n \"\u0027Four-year old dies in coyote attack.\u0027 \u0027Record heatwave in Midwest; hundreds hospitalized.\u0027 \u0027Mother\n confesses: I killed my babies.\u0027 \u0027Mystery virus erupts in eastern U.S.: Scientists baffled.\u0027\"\n There were lots more, but she didn\u0027t look at them. She looked at Hugh, her eyebrows drawn together.\n \"Thanks for sharing this. Am I supposed to fight the coyote or the virus?\"\n His lips smiled, but his eyes were bottomless and frighteningly sad. \"Nobody can fight what\u0027s\n happening-at least not in the ordinary way. And all that\u0027s just the beginning.\"\n \"Of what?\" She loved Hugh, but sometimes she\n wanted to strangle him. Old Souls loved being mysterious.\n \"Have you noticed the weather lately? It\u0027s either floods or droughts. Record cold days in winter, record\n heat in the summer. Record number of hurricanes and tornadoes. Record snowfall and hail. It just gets\n weirder and weirder every year.\"\n \"Well-sure.\" Jez shrugged. \"They talk about it on TV all the time. But it doesn\u0027t mean any-\"\n \"And the earth\u0027s being disturbed, too. Earthquakes. Volcanoes. Last year four dormant volcanoes\n erupted and there were dozens of major quakes.\"\n Jez narrowed her eyes. \"Okay...\"\n \"And there\u0027s another weird thing, even though it\u0027s not as obvious. You have to kind of dig a little to get to\n the statistics. There\u0027s been an increase in animal attacks all over the world. All kinds of animals.\" He\n tapped the pile of newspaper articles. \"This coyote attack-a couple of years ago you never heard about\n coyotes killing kids. Just like you never heard of mountain lions attacking adults. But now it\u0027s happening,\n and it\u0027s happening everywhere.\"\n Prickles of unease were going up Jez\u0027s arms. It was true, what Hugh was saying. Not that she\u0027d paid\n much attention to the human news when she was a vampire-but it did seem as if animal attacks were\n getting more frequent.\n \"A bunch of elephants stomped their trainers last year,\" she said slowly.\n \"Dog attacks are up four hundred percent,\" Hugh said. \"According to the California state police. In\n New Mexico there\u0027s an epidemic of rabid bats. In Florida they\u0027ve had seven tourists killed by alligators\n since last January-and believe me, that information was hard to find. Nobody wanted to report it\"\n \"I bet.\"\n \"Then there are the insects. We\u0027re seeing more and more people get attacked by them. Killer bees. Fire\n ants. Tiger mosquitoes-and, no, I\u0027m not joking. They\u0027re for real, and they carry dengue fever, a really\n nasty disease.\"\n \"Hugh...\"\n \"Which brings me to diseases. You have to have noticed that. There are new diseases popping up all\n over. Ebola. Mad cow disease. That flesh-eating bacteria. Hanta viruses. Lassa. Crimean-Congo\n hemorrhagic fever. You bleed from your ears and nose and mouth and into the whites of your eyes-\"\n Jez opened her mouth to say \"Hugh\" again, but he was racing on, his chest rising and falling quickly, his\n gray eyes almost feverish.\n \"And they\u0027re resistant to antibiotics the same way that the insects are resistant to pesticides. They\u0027re all\n mutating. Changing. Getting stronger and more deadly. And-\"\n \"Hugh.\" She got it in while he took a breath.\n \"-there\u0027s a hole in the ozone.\" He looked at her. \"What?\"\n \"What does it all mean?\"\n It means that things are changing. Spiraling out of control. Heading for...\" He stopped and looked\n at her. \"Jez, it\u0027s not those things themselves that are the problem. It\u0027s what\u0027s behind them.\" \"And what is\n behind them?\" Hugh said simply, \"The Old Powers are rising.\" Chills swept over Jez. The Old Powers.\n The Ancient Magic that had controlled the universe in the old days of the Night World. No one could see\n or know the Old Powers; they were forces of nature, not people. And they had been sleeping like giant\n dragons for thousands of years ever since humans had gained control of the world. If they were waking\n If magic was coming back again, everything would change.\n \"It shows in different weird ways,\" Hugh went on. \"Night People are getting more powerful. Lots of them\n have noticed it. And they say the soulmate principle is back.\"\n The soulmate principle. The idea that for every person there was one destined soulmate, one true love,\n and that the two souls were bound for eternity. Jez lifted her shoulders and dropped them without\n meeting Hugh\u0027s eyes. \"Yeah, I heard. Don\u0027t believe it, though.\"\n \"I\u0027ve seen it,\" Hugh said, and for a moment Jez\u0027s heart stopped. Then it started again as he continued, \"In\n other people, I mean. I\u0027ve seen people our age who found their soulmate, and it\u0027s really true; you can see\n it in their eyes. The Old Powers really are rising, Jez... for good and for evil. That\u0027s what\u0027s behind all\n these other changes.\"\n Jez sat very still. \"And so what happens if they keep rising?\"\n \"What happens is...\" Hugh paused and then looked at her. \"It means a time of darkness is coming,\" he\n said simply.\n \"A time-?\"\n \"Of serious darkness. The worst. We\u0027re talking the end of the world, here.\"\n Jez could feel gooseflesh on the back of her neck, where her wet hair touched her skin. She might have\n been tempted to laugh if it were anybody else telling her this. But it was Hugh, and he wasn\u0027t joking. She\n had no desire to laugh.\n \"But then it\u0027s all over,\" she said. \"There\u0027s nothing we can do. How can anybody stop the end of the\n world?\"\n \"Well.\" He ran a quick hand through his hair, pushing it off his forehead. \"That\u0027s why I\u0027m here. Because\n I\u0027m hoping you can.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-huntress-night-world-7/page-5.html","bookId":1863,"book":{"id":1863,"title":"Night World : Huntress (Night World #7)","description":"Storyline: \n Huntress (Night World Book 7) \n Jez Redfern is unique.
