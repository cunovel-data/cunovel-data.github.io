{"id":82098,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"Morgead\u0027s entire body jerked once and then went absolutely still. As if he\u0027d been turned to stone. The\n only thing alive about him was his eyes, which were staring at Jez with shock and burning disbelief.\n Well, Jez told herself, with a grim humor that was almost like sobbing grief, I startled him, that\u0027s for sure.\n I finally managed to stun Morgead speechless.\n It was only then that she realized some part of her had hoped that he already knew this, too. That he\n would be able to brush it off with exasperation, the way he had the fact that she was a Daybreaker.\n But that hope was shattered now. It had been a stupid hope anyway. Being a Daybreaker was\n something that could change, a matter of confused attitude.\n Being vermin was permanent.\n \"But that\u0027s-that\u0027s not-\" Morgead seemed to be having trouble getting the words out. His eyes were large\n with horror and denial. \"That\u0027s not possible. You\u0027re a vampire.\"\n \"Only half,\" Jez said. She felt as if she were killing something-and she was. She was murdering any hope\n for what was between them.\n Might as well stomp it good, she thought bitterly. She couldn\u0027t understand the wetness that was\n threatening to spill out of her eyes.\n \"The other half is human,\" she said shortly, almost viciously. \"My mother was human. Claire is my cousin,\n and she\u0027s human. I\u0027ve been living with my uncle Jim, my mother s brother, and his family. They\u0027re all\n human.\"\n Morgead shut his eyes. A moment of astonishing weakness for him, Jez thought coldly.\n His voice was still a whisper. \"Vampires and humans can\u0027t have kids. You can\u0027t be half and half.\"\n \"Oh, yeah, I can. My father broke the laws of the Night World. He fell in love with a human, and they\n got married, and here I am. And then, when I was three or so, some other vampires came and tried to\n kill us all.\" In her mind Jez was seeing it again, the woman with red hair who looked like a medieval\n princess, begging for her child\u0027s life. The tall man trying to protect her. \"They knew I was half human.\n They kept yelling \u0027Kill the freak.\u0027 So that\u0027s what I am, you see.\" She turned eyes she knew were\n feverishly bright on him. \"A freak.\"\n He was shaking his head, gulping as if he were\n about to be sick. It made Jez hate him, and feel sorry for him at the same time. She scarcely noticed that\n hot tears were spilling down her cheeks.\n \"I\u0027m vermin, Morgead. One of them. Prey. That\u0027s what I realized a year ago, when I left the gang. Up\n until then I had no idea, but that last night we hunted, I remembered the truth. And I knew that I had to\n go away and try to make up for all the things I\u0027d done to humans.\"\n He put a hand up to press against his eyes.\n \"I didn\u0027t just become a Daybreaker. I became a vampire hunter. I track down vampires who like to kill,\n who enjoy making humans suffer, and I stake them. You know why? Because they deserve to die.\"\n He was looking at her again, but as if he could hardly stand to. \"Jez-\"\n \"It\u0027s weird. I don\u0027t know about our connection\"- she smiled bitterly at him, to let him know she knew all\n that was over now-\"but I felt bad lying to you. I\u0027m almost glad to finally tell you the truth. I kind of\n wanted to tell you a year ago when it happened, but I knew you\u0027d kill me, and that made me a little\n hesitant.\"\n She was laughing now. She realized she was more than a little hysterical. But it didn\u0027t seem to matter.\n Nothing mattered while Morgead was looking at her with that sick disbelief in his eyes.\n \"So, anyway...\" She stretched her muscles, still smiling at him, but ready to defend herself. \"Are you\n going to try and kill me now? Or is the engagement just off?\"\n He simply looked at her. It was as if his entire spirit had gone out of him. He didn\u0027t speak, and all at\n once Jez couldn\u0027t think of anything to say, either. The silence stretched and stretched, like a yawning\n chasm between them.\n They were so far away from each other.\n You knew all along it would come to this, Jez\u0027s mind told her mockingly. How can you presume to be\n upset? He\u0027s actually taking it better than you expected. He hasn\u0027t tried to tear your throat out yet.\n At last Morgead said, in a flat and empty voice, \"That\u0027s why you wouldn\u0027t drink my blood.\"\n \"I haven\u0027t had a blood meal for a year,\" Jez said, feeling equally empty. \"I don\u0027t need to, if I don\u0027t use my\n Powers.\"\n He stared past her at the metal wall. \"Well, maybe you\u0027d better drink some of your human friends\u0027,\" he\n said tiredly. \"Because whoever has\n us-\n He broke off, suddenly alert. Jez knew what it was. The van was slowing down, and the tires were\n crunching on gravel.\n They were pulling into a driveway.\n A long driveway, and a steep one. We\u0027re somewhere out in the country, Jez thought.\n She didn\u0027t have time for any more banter with Morgead. Although she felt drained and numb, she was\n focused on outside issues now.\n \"Look,\" she said tensely as the van braked. \"I know you hate me now, but whoever has us hates us\n both. I\u0027m not asking you to help me. I just want\n to get my cousin away-and I\u0027m asking you not to stop me from doing that. Later, you can fight me or\n whatever. We can take care of that between the two of us. Just don\u0027t stop me from saving Claire.\"\n He just looked at her with dark and hollow eyes. He didn\u0027t agree or disagree. He didn\u0027t move when she\n positioned herself to erupt out of the van as soon as the back door was opened.\n But, as it turned out, she could have saved her breath. Because when the door did open, letting in\n sunlight that blinded Jez, it was to reveal five vicious-looking thugs, completely blocking the entrance.\n Three of them had spears with deadly points leveled right at Jez. The other two had guns.\n \"If anybody tries to fight,\" a voice from around the side of the van said, \"shoot the unconscious ones in\n the kneecaps.\"\n Jez sagged back. She didn\u0027t try to fight as they forced her out of the van.\n Neither, strangely, did Morgead. There were more thugs standing around behind the van, enough to\n surround both Jez and Morgead with a forest of spears as they were led to the house.\n It was a nice house, a small sturdy Queen Anne painted barn red. There were trees all around and no\n other buildings in sight.\n We\u0027re out in the boondocks, Jez thought. Maybe Point Reyes Park. Somewhere remote, anyway,\n where nobody can hear us scream.\n They were shepherded into the living room of the house, and Hugh and Claire were dumped\n unceremoniously on the floor.\n And then they were all tied up.\n Jez kept watching for an opportunity to attack. But one never came. All the time she and Morgead were\n being tied, two of the thugs pointed guns at Claire and Hugh. There was no way Jez could disarm them\n both before they got off a shot.\n Worse, she was being rendered helpless by an expert. The cords were made of bast, the inner bark of\n trees. Equally effective against vampires and humans. When the guy tying her up was through, she had no\n use of her arms or legs.\n Hugh woke up, gasping with pain, when they tied his injured arm. Claire woke up when the werewolf\n thug who\u0027d finished winding cords around her slapped her.\n Jez looked at that particular \u0027wolf carefully. She was too angry to glare at him. But she wanted to\n remember his face.\n Then she looked back at Claire, who was staring around her in bewilderment.\n \u0027I-where are we? What\u0027s going on, Jez?\"\n Hugh was also looking around, but with much less confusion. His gray eyes were simply sad and full of\n \u0027It\u0027s all right, Claire,\" Jez said. \"Just keep quiet, okay? We\u0027re in a little trouble, but don\u0027t tell them\n anything.\" She stared at her cousin, trying to will her to understand.\n \"A little trouble? I don\u0027t think so,\" came a voice from the living room doorway.\n It was the same voice that had given the order\n about shooting kneecaps. A light, cold voice, like an Arctic wind.\n The speaker was a girl.\n A very pretty girl, Jez thought irrelevantly. She had black hair that fell straight down her back like silk,\n and eyes that gleamed like topaz. Porcelain skin. A cruel smile. Lots of Power that surrounded her like a\n dark aura.\n A vampire.\n She looked perhaps a year older than Jez, but that didn\u0027t mean anything. She could be any age.\n And those eyes, Jez thought. They\u0027re vaguely familiar. Like something I\u0027ve seen in a picture....\n \"I should probably introduce myself,\" the girl said, looking at her with cold mockery. \"I\u0027m Lily Redfern.\"\n Jez felt her stomach plummet.\n Hunter Redfern\u0027s daughter.\n Well, that explained a lot.\n She was working for her father, of course. And she was a powerful enemy herself, over four hundred\n years old. There were rumors that last year she\u0027d been working the human slave trade, and making a lot\n of money at it.\n I should laugh, Jez thought. There I was telling Morgead that Hunter wanted to steal a march on the\n Council-and here he really did. Just not through me, of course. He\u0027s sent his only surviving child out to\n take care of us, to get Morgead to turn over the Wild Power.\n And that\u0027s why so many thugs-he can afford to buy as many as he needs. And the smooth\n operation-Lily\u0027s a born strategist. Not to mention absolutely merciless and cold as ice.\n She was right. We\u0027re not in a little trouble. We\u0027re in a whole lot.\n Somebody, Jez thought with a strange, quiet certainty, is going to die here.\n Lily was still talking. \"And now let me introduce my associates, who\u0027ve done so much to make this all\n possible.\" She gestured at someone hidden in the hall to come forward. \"This is Azarius. I think you\u0027ve\n met.\"\n It was the vampire Jez had fought on the platform. He was tall, with dark skin and a look of authority.\n \"And this,\" Lily said, smiling, \"is someone you\u0027ve also met.\" She gestured again, and a second figure\n appeared in the doorway. It was Pierce Holt.\n He was smiling faintly, his aristocratic face drawn in lines of genteel triumph. He waved one slender hand\n at them, his eyes as cold as Lily\u0027s.\n Morgead gave an inarticulate roar and tried to lunge at him.\n He only succeeded in falling on the floor, a struggling body in a cocoon of bast. Lily and Azarius both\n laughed. Pierce just looked scornful.\n \"You really didn\u0027t guess?\" he said. \"You\u0027re so stupid, Morgead. Coming out this morning to meet me, so\n trusting, so naive-I thought you were smarter. I\u0027m disappointed.\"\n \"No, you\u0027re dead,\" Morgead raged from the floor. He was staring at Pierce, black hair falling over his\n forehead and into green eyes that were blazing with rage. \"You are dead when this is over! You\n betrayed the gang. You\u0027re complete scum. You\u0027re-\"\n \"Shut him up,\" Lily said, and one of the thugs kicked Morgead in the head.\n He must really be out of power, Jez thought, wincing. Or he\u0027d have blasted Pierce then.\n \"I\u0027m smart,\" Pierce was saying. \"And I\u0027m going to survive. I knew something was fishy when she\"- he\n nodded toward Jez without looking at her- \"said she had a deal with Hunter Redfern. It didn\u0027t sound\n right-and then the way she was so worried about that vermin kid. So I made a few calls, and I found out\n the truth.\"\n \"You realize that your friend there is working with Circle Daybreak,\" Lily interrupted. She was also\n looking at Morgead and ignoring Jez. \"She lied to you and tricked you. She was trying to get the Wild\n Power for them.\"\n Morgead snarled something inarticulate.\n \"And she\u0027s not just a Daybreaker,\" Pierce said. Finally he looked at Jez, and it was with venomous spite.\n \"She\u0027s a mutant abomination. She\u0027s half vermin. She should have been drowned at birth.\"\n \u0027You should have been drowned at birth,\" Morgead said through locked teeth.\n Lily had been watching in amusement, but now she waved one hand. \"Okay, enough fun and games.\n Down to business.\" Two of the thugs sat Morgead back up, and Lily walked to the middle of the room.\n She looked at each of them in turn, Jez last. \"I\u0027ve only got one question for you,\" she\n said in her cool, quiet voice. \"Which human is the Wild Power?\"\n Jez stared at her.\n She doesn\u0027t know. She knows almost everything else, but not that. And if she can\u0027t find out...\n Jez gave Hugh and Claire one long, intense look, telling them to keep silent. Then she looked back at\n Lily.\n \"I have no idea what you\u0027re talking about.\"\n Lily hit her.\n It was a pretty good blow, but nothing to compare with what Jez got when she was in a fight. Jez\n laughed, a natural laugh of surprise and scorn.\n Lily\u0027s hawklike golden eyes went icy.\n \"You think this is funny?\" she said, still quietly. \"My father sent me to get the Wild Power, and that\u0027s just\n what I\u0027m going to do. Even if it means tearing you and your vampire boyfriend to pieces, mutant.\"\n \"Yeah, well, suppose I don\u0027t know? Did you ever think of that? Then I can\u0027t tell, no matter what you and\n your little...\" Jez glanced at Pierce and Azarius. \"Your little hobgoblins do.\"\n Lily\u0027s porcelain skin was flushing with fury. It brought out faint scars on one side of her face that Jez\n hadn\u0027t noticed before, like mostly-healed burn marks. \"Look, you little freak-\" Then she turned to the\n thugs. \"Teach her a lesson.\"\n Things were exciting for a while. Jez could hear Claire and Hugh yelling and Morgead snarling while the\n hobgoblins beat her up. She hardly felt\n the blows herself. She was in a place where they didn\u0027t matter.\n When they finally got tired and stopped, Lily walked up to her again.\n \"Now,\" she said sweetly, \"has your memory gotten any better.\"\n Jez looked at her from under a swelling eyelid. \"I can\u0027t tell you something I don\u0027t know.\"\n Lily opened her mouth, but before she could speak, a new voice cut in.\n \"She doesn\u0027t have to tell you,\" Hugh said. \"Ill tell you. It\u0027s me.\"\n Lily swiveled slowly to look at him.\n He was sitting up straight inside his cocoon of bonds, his face calm under the dried blood. His gray eyes\n were clear and straightforward. He didn\u0027t look afraid.\n Oh, Hugh, Jez thought. Her heart was beating slow and hard and her eyes prickled.\n Lily glanced at Azarius.\n He shrugged. \"Sure, it could be. I told you, it could be either of them. They were both at the station\n when the flash came and the train stopped.\"\n \"Hmm,\" Lily said, a sound like a cat purring to dinner. She moved toward Hugh. He didn\u0027t look away\n from her, didn\u0027t flinch.\n But beside him, Claire gave a convulsive wiggle.\n She had been watching everything with a desperate, dazed expression. Jez was sure she didn\u0027t\n understand a quarter of what was going on. But now she suddenly lost the muddled look. Her dark eyes\n sparked and she looked like the Claire who\u0027d\n taunted Jez a hundred times in the hallway back home.\n \u0027I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about,\" she said to Hugh. \"You know perfectly well it\u0027s me.\" She\n turned to Lily. Tm the Wild Power.\"\n Lily\u0027s mouth tightened. She put her hands on her hips, looking from Hugh to Claire.\n Then Jez heard the strangest sound of her life.\n It was laughing-a wild and reckless laughing. There was an edge almost like crying to it, but also\n something that was exhilarated, daredevil, free.\n \"If you really want to know who it is,\" Morgead said, \"ifs me.\"\n Lily whirled to glare at him. Jez simply stared, dumbfounded.\n She\u0027d never seen him look so handsome-or so mocking. His smile was brilliant and flashing, his dark hair\n was falling all over his eyes, and his eyes were blazing green emeralds. He was tied up, but he was sitting\n with his head thrown back like a prince.\n Something tore inside Jez.\n She didn\u0027t understand why he would do it. He must know he wasn\u0027t saving her. The only people he\n might possibly save were Hugh and Claire. And why would he care about them?\n Besides, it was a futile gesture. He didn\u0027t realize that he couldn\u0027t be the Wild Power, that he hadn\u0027t been\n around when the train stopped.\n But-it was such a gallant gesture, too. Probably the most gallant thing Jez had ever seen.\n She stared at him, feeling the wetness spill from\n her eyes again, wishing she were telepathic and could ask him why in the worlds he had done it.\n Then his green eyes turned to her, and she heard his mental voice.\n There\u0027s just a chance they\u0027ll let one of them go with a beating. Just maybe-as a warning to Circle\n Daybreak not to mess with Hunter anymore. Especially if I convince Lily I\u0027ll work with her.\n Jez couldn\u0027t answer, but she shook her head very faintly, and looked at him in despair. She knew he\n could read that. Do you know what they\u0027ll do to you? Especially when they find out you\u0027re a fake?\n She saw his faint answering smile. He knew.\n What difference does it make? he said in her mind. You and me-we\u0027re lost anyway. And without you, I\n don\u0027t care what happens.\n Jez couldn\u0027t show any reaction to that at all. Her vision was dimming, and her heart felt as if it were trying\n to claw itself out of her chest.\n Oh, Morgead ...\n Lily was breathing hard, on the verge of losing control. \"If I have to kill all of you-\"\n \"Wait,\" Pierce said, his cool voice a striking contrast to Lily\u0027s strained one. \"There\u0027s a simple way to find\n out.\" He pointed at Jez. \"Stake her.\"\n Lily glared at him. \"What?\"\n \"She\u0027s never going to tell you anything. She\u0027s expendable. And there\u0027s something you have to understand\n about the Wild Power.\" He moved smoothly to Lily\u0027s side. \"I think Morgead was right about one thing. I\n think the Wild Power isn\u0027t operating consciously at this point. It\u0027s only when the\n danger is greatest, when there\u0027s no physical way to escape, that the power comes out.\"\n Lily cast a sideways look at Hugh and Claire, who were sitting tensely, their eyes wide. \"You mean they\n may not know which it is?\"\n \"Maybe not. Maybe it\u0027s completely automatic at this point. But there\u0027s one way to find out. They all\n seem-attached-to the halfbreed. Put her life in danger, and then see which of them can break free and try\n to save her.\"\n Lily\u0027s perfect lips slowly curved in a smile. \"I knew there was a reason I liked you,\" she said. Then she\n gestured at the thugs. \"Go on, do it\" Everything was confused for a bit. Not because Jez was struggling.\n She wasn\u0027t. But Claire was screaming and Hugh and Morgead were shouting, and Lily was laughing.\n When the worst of the noise died down, Jez found herself on her back. Azarius was standing over her,\n and he was holding a hammer and stake.\n \"Isn\u0027t it interesting,\" Lily was saying, \"that a stake through the heart is the one thing that takes care of\n humans and vampires equally efficiently?\"\n \"And halfbreeds, too,\" Pierce said. They were on either side of Azarius, looking down and laughing.\n \"Lily, listen. Listen,\" Morgead said, his voice hoarse and desperate. \"You don\u0027t have to do this. I already\n told you, it\u0027s me. Just wait a minute and talk to me-*\n \"Don\u0027t even bother, human-lover,\" Lily said without glancing at him. \"If you\u0027re the Wild Power, then save\n her.\"\n \"Don\u0027t any of you do anything!\" Jez yelled. \"Not anything, do you understand?\"\n She was yelling it mainly at Claire-or was she?\n Suddenly Jez felt strangely uncertain.\n Her heart was beating very quickly, and her mind was racing even faster. Fragments of thought were\n glittering through her consciousness, like bits of melody almost too faint to catch. It was as if all the\n prophecies she\u0027d heard about the Wild Powers were echoing, ricocheting around her brain at insane\n speed. And there was something about them, something that was bothering her. Something that made her\n wonder...\n Could it be that Claire wasn\u0027t the Wild Power? Jez had assumed she was-but was it possible that she\u0027d\n been wrong?\n Hugh had been on the platform, too, watching the train approach. Hugh had reason to be upset at having\n to watch Jez die. He cared about her. Jez knew that now. And Hugh was seventeen.\n Could Hugh be the Wild Power?\n He hadn\u0027t been in the Marina district-but he lived in the Bay Area; there was no reason he couldn\u0027t have\n been watching the fire just as she and Claire had.\n But there was still something nagging at her. The prophecies... \u0027two eyes are watching\u0027... \u0027Four of\n blue fire, power in their blood....\u0027\n Lily was speaking. Jez heard her as if from a great distance.\n \"Do it. Right beside the heart first.\"\n Azarius positioned the stake. He raised the hammer.\n Morgead screamed, \"Jez!\"\n Jez shouted, \"None of you do anything-\"\n And then the hammer came down and the universe exploded in red agony. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-huntress-night-world-7/page-17.html","bookId":1863,"book":{"id":1863,"title":"Night World : Huntress (Night World #7)","description":"Storyline: \n Huntress (Night World Book 7) \n Jez Redfern is unique.
