{"id":82095,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"Did you have trouble getting away?\" Hugh said It was the next morning, a very different sort of day from yesterday. The sky was overcast and the air was heavy. Everyone Jez had passed at the Concord BART station looked a little depressed. \"Eh, a little,\" she said, and sat down by Hugh on the platform. They were at the far end of the station, beyond the covered area with benches, beside a little concrete security house. It was a safe and private meeting place since the station was almost deserted after the morning commute. \"They chained up my bike with this huge chain. Claire drove me to school-she\u0027s been watching me like a werewolf guarding dinner. And Aunt Nan called the office to make sure I didn\u0027t cut\" Hugh shifted in concern. There was a tiny breath of warm wind, and it stirred his fair hair. \"So what did you do?\" Jez grinned. \"I cut.\" She shrugged and added, \"I got a guy from my auto shop class to drive me here. It wasn\u0027t hard.\" He smiled at her sadly, his gray eyes distant. \"But they\u0027re going to find out. Jez, I\u0027m really sorry for completely messing up your life.\" She shrugged again. \"Yeah, but if I don\u0027t do it, everybody\u0027s life is going to be even more completely messed up. Every human\u0027s.\" \"I know.\" He shivered slightly. Then he drew up his legs, clasping his arms around them. He looked at her with his chin on his knees. \"So what did you find out?\" \"That the girl Morgead thought was the Wild Power isn\u0027t.\" He looks so cute that way, Jez thought helplessly. So-compact. Morgead would never sit like that. Hugh winced. \"Great. You\u0027re sure?\" \"Yeah. It was a little kid, eight years old, and she was something special-but not that. She was...\" Jez tried to think of a way to describe it. Hugh watched her with eyes that were clear and fathomless, sad and wry and gentle all at once. And suddenly Jez got it. She gasped. \"Goddess-I know! She was like you. That kid was an Old Soul.\" Hugh\u0027s eyebrows went up. \"You think?\" \"I\u0027m sure of it. She had that same way of looking at you as if she\u0027s seen all of history and she knows that you\u0027re just a little part. That... trig picture\u0027 look. As if she were beyond stupid human things.\" \"But not a Wild Power,\" Hugh said softly. He looked half discouraged and half relieved. \"So then the Morgead connection is useless.\" \"Actually, no. Because he\u0027s got evidence for the Wild Power on videotape.\" Jez explained about the movie and the fire and the blue flash. \"So somebody around that kid is probably it. I know that area and so does Morgead. We may be able to find out who.\" Hugh chewed his lip. Then he looked directly at her. \"It sounds dangerous. Just how is Morgead taking tins-you coming back and all?\" Jez stared out across the BART tracks. They looked like regular train tracks, except for the big one labeled danger electric third rah.. There was a sound like faraway thunder, and then a train came whizzing up like a sleek futuristic white dragon. It stopped and a few people got on and off in the distance. She waited until it left again to answer. \"He... wasn\u0027t very happy at first. But then he kind of got used to it. I don\u0027t think he\u0027s going to make any trouble-unless he finds out, you know.\" She wasn\u0027t sure what else to say. She didn\u0027t want to talk to Hugh about Morgead-and she certainly didn\u0027t want to explain what had happened. Especially not when she was so confused about it all herself. \"You still think he\u0027d hate you if he found out you were half human?\" Hugh\u0027s voice was quiet. Jez laughed shortly. \"Believe it. He would.\" There was a silence, while Hugh looked at her. Suddenly Jez found her mind posing an odd question. If it were Hugh or Morgead, which would she take? Of course, it was a completely ridiculous question. She couldn\u0027t have either of them. Hugh was an Old Soul, and beyond her reach. Not to mention that he only thought of her as a friend. And Morgead might be her soulmate, but he would murder her if he ever discovered the truth. But still, if she did have a choice... Hugh or Morgead? A day ago she\u0027d have said Hugh without question. How strange that now it came up the other way. Because, impossible as it was, deadly as she knew it to be, it was Morgead she was in love with. And she had only just understood that this moment. What a pity that there was no hope in the world for them. Jez found herself giving another short laugh- and then she realized that Hugh was still looking at her. She could feel color rise to her cheeks. \"You were miles away again.\" Tm just foggy. Not enough sleep, I guess.\" Plus all that fun yesterday. She was still sore from the stick fight and the fall with Iona. But that wasn\u0027t Hugh\u0027s problem. She took a breath, groping for another subject. \"You know, there was something I wanted to ask you. Morgead said the Council had dug up another prophecy-about where each of the Wild Powers is from. Have you heard it?\" When he shook his head, she quoted: \"One from the land of kings long forgotten; One from the hearth which still holds the spark; One from the Day World where two eyes are watching; One from the twilight to be one with the dark.\" \"Interesting.\" Hugh\u0027s gray eyes had lit up. \" \u0027One from the hearth\u0027... that\u0027s got to be the Harman witches. Their last name was originally \u0027Hearth-Woman.\u0027 \" \"Yeah. But the line about the one from the Day World-that one\u0027s a human, right?\" \"It sounds like it.\" \"That\u0027s what Morgead thought-that\u0027s why he thought the little girl might be a Wild Power even though she was human. But what I can\u0027t figure out is what it means by \u0027where two eyes are watching.\u0027\" \"Mmm...\" Hugh gazed into the distance, as if he liked the challenge. \"The only thing I can think of that combines the idea of \u0027Day* and \u0027eyes\u0027 is a poem. It goes something like \u0027The Night has a thousand eyes, and the Day only one.\u0027 The one eye being the sun, you know, and the thousand eyes the stars at night.\" \"Hmpf. What about the moon?\" Hugh grinned. \u0027I don\u0027t know. Maybe the author wasn\u0027t good at astronomy.\" \"Well-that doesn\u0027t help much. I thought it might be a clue. But the truth is that we don\u0027t even know if it\u0027s the human Wild Power we\u0027re after.\" Hugh put his chin on his knees again. \"True. But I\u0027ll let Circle Daybreak know about that prophecy. It might help eventually.\" He was silent a moment, then added, \"You know, they dug up something interesting, too. Apparently the Hopi Tribe predicted the end of the world pretty accurately.\" \"The Hopi?\" \"I should say, the ends of the worlds. They knew that it had happened before their time, and that it would happen again. Their legend says that the first world was destroyed by fire. The second world was destroyed by ice. The third world ended in water- a universal flood. And the fourth world-well, that\u0027s ours. It\u0027s supposed to end in blood and darkness- and end soon.\" Jez murmured, \"The first world-?\" \"Don\u0027t remember your Night World history?\" He tched at her, with a smile that didn\u0027t reach his eyes. \"The first civilization was the shapeshifters\u0027. Back when humans were scared to go out of their caves, the shapeshifters ruled and the humans thought of them as gods. Animal spirits, totems. It was Shapeshifter World. That lasted for about ten thousand years, until a bunch of volcanoes suddenly became active-\" \"Fire.\" \"Yeah. The weather changed, people migrated, and the shapeshifters lost control. After that it was really Witch World. The witches did better than everybody else for ten thousand years, but then there was an Ice Age-\" \"And the Night Wars,\" Jez said, remembering. \"When the vampires fought the witches.\" \"Right. And after all that, the vampires were in control; it was Vampire World. Which lasted about another ten thousand years, until the flood. And after the flood, human civilization really started. It was Human World, and it has been for a long time. The Night People have just been hanging on around the edges, hiding. But. . .\" He paused and straightened. \"That started about eight thousand B.C.\" \"Oh.\" \"Yeah. The millennium marks the end of our ten thousand years.\" He gave his gentle, half-mocking smile. \"We humans are about to lose our lease. Something\u0027s going to happen to bring blood and darkness and then there\u0027ll be a whole new world.\" \"Only if we don\u0027t stop it,\" Jez said. \"And we will- because we have to.\" Hugh\u0027s smiled changed, softening. \"I think we\u0027re lucky to have people like you trying.\" Then he lost the smile completely. He looked uncertain. \"Jez- you know, Old Souls aren\u0027t really beyond \u0027stupid human things.\u0027 We\u0027re as human as anybody. And we ... I mean, and I...\" Jez\u0027s heart was beating uncomfortably fast. The way he was looking at her-she\u0027d never seen Hugh look like that at anything or anyone. Another rumble in the distance, and then a train came rushing in. Hugh blinked, glanced up at the digital clock display above the platform, then checked his watch. He cursed. Tm supposed to be somewhere. I\u0027m late.\" Jez\u0027s heart gave a strange thump. But not of disappointment. Weirdly, it was more like relief. \"Me, too,\" she said. \"I\u0027m supposed to meet Morgead before everybody else gets out of school. I ought to take the next train to San Francisco.\" He still hesitated. \"Jez-\" \"Go on,\" she said, standing up. \"Ill call you if I turn up anything. Wish me luck.\" \"Be careful,\" he said instead, and then he was hurrying away. Jez watched him go. She couldn\u0027t help wondering what he had been about to say. Then she turned to walk back to the central part of the station. She was partway around the concrete guardhouse when she heard a noise on the other side. A stealthy, sneaking noise. Not the kind a security guard would make. Jez didn\u0027t hesitate. Smoothly, completely soundless herself, she changed course, turning back and going around the structure the other way to get behind the sneaker. The instant she had a clear view of the intruder\u0027s back, she jumped. She landed on top of her quarry, with a control hold on the person\u0027s wrist. But she already knew that this wasn\u0027t going to be a fight to the death. \"Jez-ow-it\u0027s me!\" Claire spluttered. \"I know it\u0027s you, Claire.\" \"Let go of my arm!\" \"I don\u0027t think so, Claire. You having an interesting morning? Hear any good jokes?\" \"Jez!\" Claire struggled, hurting herself, then got mad and hurt herself more trying to hit Jez. Jez allowed her to sit up, still keeping hold of her. Claire\u0027s face was flushed and wrathful, her dark hair sticking in strands to her cheeks. Her eyes were shooting sparks. \"Okay, so I\u0027m sorry for eavesdropping. I followed you when Greg Ludlum drove you here. I wanted to know what you were doing. I didn\u0027t know that you were completely freaking insane!\" \"Well, it\u0027s too bad you didn\u0027t figure it out earlier. Because unfortunately I have to kill you now to keep you from talking.\" Claire\u0027s eyes widened and she choked. Jez suddenly realized that underneath all the sparks and the yelling her cousin was terrified. She let go of Claire\u0027s arm and Claire slumped away from her, rubbing it. \"You-you are insane, aren\u0027t you?\" Claire looked at her sideways, through clinging strands of hair. \"I mean, all that stuff about the world ending-it\u0027s some kind of bizarre game you\u0027re playing with your weird friends, isn\u0027t it? Some kind of Dungeons and Dragons stuff...\" \"What do you think, Claire?\" Jez stood up and offered Claire a hand, worried that someone might notice them. She kept that hand on Claire as she herded Claire back behind the guard house. The truth was that this situation wasn\u0027t funny. Claire really was in trouble-because Jez was in trouble. Her entire cover was blown. Everything she\u0027d worked for in the past year-Claire could destroy it all. Claire knew way too much, and Claire hated her enough to use it. \"I think ... I don\u0027t know what to think.\" Claire swallowed. \"Who was that guy?\" \"One of my weird friends. Right?\" \"He didn\u0027t seem so weird. When he said things- I don\u0027t know. They sounded...\" Claire\u0027s voice trailed off. Finally it came back, almost inaudibly. \"Real.\" \"Great.\" I am going to have to kill her. What else can I do? \"It\u0027s not a game, is it?\" Claire said, looking at her. All the anger was gone from the dark eyes now. They were simply bewildered and frightened. Then Claire shook her head. \"But, I mean, it\u0027s impossible. Vampires and shapeshifters and witches-it\u0027s all just...\" Her voice trailed off again. Jez was simply looking at her, with eyes that might be less silvery than a year ago, but that she knew were still pretty strange. And after a few moments Claire\u0027s gaze lost its focus and her whole body seemed to fall in on itself, as if it had lost something vital. Innocence maybe, Jez thought grimly. \"Oh, God, it is true,\" Claire whispered. \u0027I mean, it\u0027s really true. That\u0027s why you\u0027re gone all the time, isn\u0027t it? You\u0027re off-doing something.\" Jez said, \"Yeah.\" Claire sagged against the guardhouse. \"Oh, God. I ... God. I feel so strange. It\u0027s like-nothing is what I thought.\" Yeah, I know the feeling, Jez thought. When the whole world turns around and you have to adjust in two seconds flat. It happened to me, too, a year ago. But none of that was going to help Claire. All she could say was \"I\u0027m sorry.\" Claire didn\u0027t seem to hear her. She was speaking in a voice that was just a breath. \"That\u0027s why... that\u0027s why all that weird stuff with your father. Nobody knowing anything about his family and all. I knew from the beginning that there was something about you; I just couldn\u0027t tell what it was.\" Oh, great, Jez thought. Here it comes. She tried to keep her face impassive as Claire faced her squarely, raising her eyes with a look somewhere between wonder and dread. \"That guy-he said you were only half human. Which means you\u0027re half... something else?\" \"I\u0027m half human and half vampire,\" Jez said quietly. The interesting thing was that it was so easy to get out. She\u0027d only ever spoken the words aloud to one person before: Hugh. Now she looked to see if Claire would actually faint or just fall down. Claire did neither. She just shut her eyes. \"You know the really insane thing? I believe that.\" She opened her eyes again. \"But-I didn\u0027t know you could be. Half and half.\" \"Neither did anybody else, till I was born. I\u0027m the only one.\" Jez examined her cousin, realized that she really wasn\u0027t going to faint. When she spoke again, her voice came out more challenging than she meant it to. \"So now that you know, Claire, what are you going to do about it?\" \"What do you mean, what am I going to do?\" Claire glanced around, then her voice dropped as her eyes glinted with interest. \"Look-do you, like, have to drink blood and everything?\" \"Not anymore,\" Jez said shortly. What was this? Who would have thought that studious, straitlaced Claire would have such an interest in vampires? \"But you mean you used to?\" \"Before I came to live with you guys. I thought I was a full vampire then. But I found out that I could live without it, as long as I didn\u0027t use my powers.\" \"You\u0027ve got powers? Really? What kind?\" \"No kind. Look, enough with the questions. I told you, I\u0027m not a vampire anymore.\" \"And you\u0027re not evil.\" Claire said it flatly. Jez looked at her, startled. \"What makes you say that?\" \"I heard what you were talking about, saving the world and all. I didn\u0027t understand it, but it sounded like you were on the right side. And-\" Claire hesitated, then shrugged. \"And I know you, okay? I mean, you\u0027re arrogant and stubborn and you never explain anything, but you\u0027re not evil. You just aren\u0027t-inside. I can tell.\" Jez laughed. A real laugh. She couldn\u0027t help it. Of all people, Claire. She\u0027d misjudged this girl who was her own age but had nothing else in common with her. Her cousin had unexpected depths. \"Well, thanks,\" she said. \"I try not to be too evil- these days.\" Then she sobered. \"Look, Claire, if you really think that, and if you really believe that the stuff you heard was true-\" \"About the end of the world? I don\u0027t believe it. I mean, I heard it, and I believe you believe it-and when I first heard it I kind of believed it, but-\" \"Just-skip the rest and plain believe it, Claire. It happens to be the truth. And I\u0027m trying to do something about it.\" \"Something about a Wild Power, right?\" Claire wasn\u0027t sagging anymore. She looked almost excited. \"But what\u0027s a-\" \"You don\u0027t need to know. The point is that if you want to, you can help me.\" \"I can? Really?\" \"You can help me by going back to school and forgetting that this ever happened. You can help me by keeping my secret and not ever saying a word about this to anybody. And, incidentally, you\u0027ll be keeping your family safe at the same time.\" Claire looked away, worked her jaw. \"This stuff you\u0027re doing is pretty dangerous.\" It wasn\u0027t a question. \"Very dangerous.\" Jez stepped back. \"And I\u0027m late for it right now. So do we have a deal? Will you help me or not? Can I trust you?\" \"Or otherwise you\u0027re gonna kill me, right?\" Claire looked at her sarcastically. Jez rolled her eyes. \"Don\u0027t tempt me. Seriously, are you going to help?\" \"No.\" Jez froze, looking down at the shorter girl. \"What?\" \"Jez-don\u0027t get mad, but I don\u0027t think I can. Not that way.\" Claire was looking back up steadily, her small face serious and surprisingly determined. \u0027I mean how can I possibly just walk away, after hearing all that? If everything you said is true, how can I forget?\" \"You can because you have to. We all do what we have to do.\" Jez looked around the station. Another train should be coming any minute. She simply didn\u0027t have time to spend convincing a human to stay out of business that would kill her. To properly explain it to Claire would take days. All she could do was ask for something she never would have imagined Claire could give her. \"Claire... there\u0027s no way I can convince you or make you do what I want. But I\u0027m asking you-\" She let out her breath and went on: \"I\u0027m asking you to trust me. I\u0027m asking you to walk away and at least try to forget this. And to believe that I\u0027m trying the best I can to do the right thing.\" Claire kept looking at her steadily for a moment. Then, all at once, the dark eyes filled. They turned away, and Claire\u0027s throat moved once as she swallowed. Then, slowly, she nodded. \"Okay,\" she whispered. \"I mean-it\u0027s okay for now. I mean, I guess I can talk to you later about it.\" Jez let out her breath. \"That\u0027s right.\" Claire stood there for another second, then straightened her shoulders and turned away. But just as suddenly she turned back, looking tense and almost explosive. \"There\u0027s something I have to say to you.\" Jez glanced down the tracks. No train. \"Okay.\" \"It\u0027s-it\u0027s... that I\u0027m sorry. I\u0027m sorry I bugged you and tried to get Mom mad at you and everything. I was just-I was jealous because they let you get away with anything, and...\" She shook her head fiercely and then went on, shrugging grimly as if she hated to admit it. \"And, yeah, because you\u0027re so gorgeous and confident and everything. It made me feel bad and I wanted to hurt you. So. Anyway. There. I\u0027m sorry.\" She started to walk away, wobbling a little. \"Claire.\" Claire paused, then turned around. Jez spoke a little hesitantly around the obstruction in her throat. \"It\u0027s okay. And thank you.\" \"Yeah.\" Claire grinned and gave a little shrug. \"See ya later.\" She turned around and started walking See ya, Jez thought. She felt suddenly tired and strangely emotional. There was too much inside hen sadness and relief and worry and a new feeling for Claire. She crossed her arms and looked around the station, trying to relax, taking deep, even breaths. And saw two werewolves coming straight for Claire.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-huntress-night-world-7/page-14.html","bookId":1863,"book":{"id":1863,"title":"Night World : Huntress (Night World #7)","description":"Storyline: Huntress (Night World Book 7) Jez Redfern is unique.
