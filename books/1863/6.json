How?\"\\n\\n \"First, I ought to tell you that it\u0027s not just me that believes all this about the millennium. It\u0027s not even Circle\\n\\n Daybreak that believes it. It\u0027s the Night World Council, Jez.\"\\n\\n \"The joint Council? Witches and vampires?\"\\n\\n Hugh nodded again. \"They had a big meeting about it this summer. And they dug up some old\\n\\n prophecies about what\u0027s going to happen this time.\"\\n\\n \"Like?\"\\n\\n Hugh looked slightly self-conscious. \"Here\u0027s one. It used to rhyme in the original, I think, but this is the\\n\\n translation.\" He took a breath and quoted slowly:\\n\\n \u0027In blue fire, the final darkness is banished. In blood, the final price is paid.\"\\n\\n Great, Jez thought. Whose blood? But Hugh was going on.\\n\\n \"Four to stand between the light and the\\n\\n shadow,\\n\\n Four of blue fire, power in their blood. Born in the year of the blind Maiden\u0027s vision; Four less one and\\n\\n darkness triumphs.\"\\n\\n Jez blinked slowly. \"What\u0027s blue fire?\"\\n\\n \"Nobody knows.\"\\n\\n \"\u0027Four to stand between the light and the shadow...\u0027 Meaning to hold off the end of the world?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s what the Council thinks. They think it means that four people have been born, four Wild Powers\\n\\n who\u0027re going to be instrumental in whatever\u0027s coming, whatever battle or disaster that\u0027s going to destroy\\n\\n us. Those four can stop the end of the world-but only if all of them fight together.\"\\n\\n \"\u0027Four less one and darkness triumphs,\" Jez said.\\n\\n \"Right. And that\u0027s where you come in.\"\\n\\n \"Sorry, I don\u0027t think I\u0027m one of them.\"\\n\\n Hugh smiled. \"That\u0027s not what I meant. The fact is, somebody around here has already reported\\n\\n finding a Wild Power. Circle Daybreak intercepted a message from him to the Council saying that hell\\n\\n hand the Wild Power over to them if they make it worth his while. Otherwise hell just sit tight until they\u0027re\\n\\n desperate enough to agree to his terms.\"\\n\\n Jez had a sinking feeling. She said one word. \"Who?\"\\n\\n Hugh\u0027s expression was knowing and regretful. It\u0027s one of your old gang, Jez. Morgead Blackthorn.\"\\n\\n Jez shut her eyes.\\n\\n Yeah, that sounded like Morgead, trying to shake down the Night World Council. Only he was crazy\\n\\n and nervy enough to do that. He was stubborn, too-perfectly capable of letting disaster come if he didn\u0027t\\n\\n get his way. But of all the people in the world, why did it have to be him? And how had he found a Wild\\n\\n Power, anyway?\\n\\n Hugh was speaking again softly. \"You can see why we need you. Somebody has to get to him and find\\n\\n out who the Wild Power is-and you\u0027re the only one who stands a chance of doing that.\"\\n\\n Jez pushed hair off her face and breathed slowly, trying to think.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t need to tell you how dangerous it is,\" Hugh said, looking into the distance again. \"And I don\u0027t\\n\\n want to ask you to do it. In fact, if you\u0027re smart, you\u0027ll tell me to get lost right now.\"\\n\\n Jez couldn\u0027t tell him to get lost \"What I don\u0027t understand is why we can\u0027t just let the Council take care of\\n\\n it. They\u0027ll want the Wild Powers bad, and they have a lot more resources.\"\\n\\n Hugh glanced back at her, startled. His gray eyes\\n\\n were wide with an expression that Jez had never seen before. Then he smiled, and it was an incredibly\\n\\n sad smile.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s just what we can\u0027t do. You\u0027re right, the Council wants the Wild Powers. But not so they can fight\\n\\n the end of the world. Jez... they only want them so they can kill them.\"\\n\\n That was when Jez realized what his expression was. It was gentle regret for innocence-her innocence.\\n\\n She couldn\u0027t believe how stupid she had been.\\n\\n \"Oh, Goddess,\" she said slowly.\\n\\n Hugh nodded. \"They want it to happen. At least the vampires do. If the human world ends-well, that\u0027s\\n\\n their chance, isn\u0027t it? For thousands of years the Night People have had to hide, to live in the shadows\\n\\n while the humans spread all over the world. But the Council wants that to change.\"\\n\\n The reason Jez had been so slow was that it was hard for her to imagine anybody actually wanting to\\n\\n bring on the Apocalypse. But of course it made sense. \"They\u0027re willing to risk being destroyed\\n\\n themselves,\" she whispered.\\n\\n \"They figure that whatever happens, it\u0027ll be worse on the humans, since the humans don\u0027t know it\u0027s\\n\\n coming. Hell, some of the Night People think they\u0027re what\u0027s coming. Hunter Redfern is saying that\\n\\n vampires are going to wipe out and enslave the humans and that after that the Night World is going to\\n\\n reign.\"\\n\\n Jez felt a new chill. Hunter Redfern. Her ancestor, who was over five hundred years old but looked\\n\\n about thirty. He was bad, and he practically ran the Council.\\n\\n \"Great,\" she muttered. \"So my family\u0027s going to destroy the world.\"\\n\\n Hugh gave her a bleak smile. \"Hunter says the Old Powers are rising to make vampires stronger so they\\n\\n can take over. And the scary thing is, he\u0027s right. Like I said before, the Night People are getting stronger,\\n\\n developing more powers. Nobody knows why. But most of the vampires on the Council seem to believe\\n\\n Hunter.\"\\n\\n \"So we don\u0027t have much time,\" Jez said. \"We have to get the Wild Power before Morgead makes a deal\\n\\n with the Night World.\"\\n\\n \"Right. Circle Daybreak is fixing up a safe place to keep the Wild Powers until we get all four. And the\\n\\n Council knows we\u0027re doing it-that\u0027s probably why that ghoul was following me. They\u0027re watching us. I\u0027m\\n\\n just sorry I led it here,\" he added absently, with a worried look around the room.\\n\\n \"Doesn\u0027t matter. He\u0027s not telling anybody anything.\"\\n\\n \"No. Thanks to you. But we\u0027ll meet someplace different next time. I can\u0027t endanger your family.\" He\\n\\n looked back at her. \"Jez, if the Night World manages to kill even one of the Wild Powers-well, if you\\n\\n believe the prophecy, it\u0027s all over.\"\\n\\n Jez understood now. She still had questions, but they could wait. One thing was clear in her mind.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll do it. I have to.\"\\n\\n Hugh said very quietly, \"Are you sure?\"\\n\\n \"Well, somebody has to. And you were right; I\u0027m the only one who can handle Morgead.\"\\n\\n The truth was that she thought nobody could handle Morgead-but she certainly had a better chance than\\n\\n any Circle Daybreaker. Of course, she wouldn\u0027t survive the assignment Even if she managed to steal the\\n\\n Wild Power out from under Morgead\u0027s nose, he\u0027d hunt her down and kill her for it\\n\\n That was irrelevant\\n\\n \"He hates me, and I hate him, but at least I know him,\" she said out loud.\\n\\n There was a silence and she realized that Hugh was looking at her oddly. \"You think he hates you?\"\\n\\n \"Of course. All we ever did was fight\"\\n\\n Hugh smiled very faintly-an Old Soul look. I see.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s that supposed to mean?\"\\n\\n \u0027It means-I don\u0027t think he hates you, Jez. Maybe he has strong emotions for you, but from what I\u0027ve\\n\\n heard I don\u0027t think hate is one of them.\"\\n\\n Jez shook her head. \"You don\u0027t understand. He was always gunning for me. And if he found out I\u0027m half\\n\\n human-well, that would be the end. He hates humans worse than anything. But I think I can fool him for\\n\\n as long as it takes to get the Wild Power.\"\\n\\n Hugh nodded, but he didn\u0027t look happy. His eyes were bruised and tired. If you can pull it off, you\u0027ll\\n\\n save a lot of lives.\"\\n\\n He knows, too, Jez thought. That I\u0027ll die doing this.\\n\\n It was some comfort that he cared-and more\\n\\n comfort that he didn\u0027t understand why she was doing it. Sure, she wanted to save lives. But there was\\n\\n something else.\\n\\n The Council had tried to mess with Hugh. They\u0027d sent a stinking ghoul after him. They would probably\\n\\n send something different tomorrow-certainly, they\u0027d keep trying to kill him.\\n\\n And for that, Jez was going to wipe the floor with them. Hugh wasn\u0027t any kind of fighter. He couldn\u0027t\\n\\n defend himself. He shouldn\u0027t be a target.\\n\\n She realized that Hugh was still looking at her, with pain in his eyes. She smiled to show him that she\\n\\n wasn\u0027t afraid of dying.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a family affair,\" she told him-and that was true, too. \"Hunter\u0027s my\\n\\n great-great-great-great-great-grandfather. It\u0027s only right that I stop him. And if anything happens to\\n\\n me-well, one Redfern less is probably a blessing to the world.\"\\n\\n And that was the last part of the truth. She came from a tainted family. No matter what she did, who she\\n\\n saved, or how hard she tried, there would always be vampire blood running in her veins. She was a\\n\\n potential danger to humanity by her very existence.\\n\\n But Hugh was looking horrified. \"Don\u0027t you ever say that\" He stared at her for another moment and then\\n\\n took her by the shoulders, squeezing. \"Jez, you\u0027re one of the best people I know. What you did before\\n\\n last year is-\"\\n\\n \"Is part of me,\" Jez said. She was trying not to feel his warm grip through her T-shirt, trying not to show\\n\\n that his little squeeze sent a shock through\\n\\n her entire body. \"And nothing can change that. I know what I am.\"\\n\\n Hugh shook her slightly. \"Jez-\"\\n\\n \"And right now, I have to get rid of that ghoul. And you\u0027d better be getting home.\"\\n\\n For a moment she thought he was going to shake her again; then he slowly let go of her. \u0027You\u0027re officially\\n\\n accepting the assignment?\" The way he said it sounded as if he were giving her one last chance not to.\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n He nodded. He didn\u0027t ask how she planned on getting back into a gang that she\u0027d abandoned, or getting\\n\\n information from Morgead, who hated her. Jez knew why. He simply trusted that she could do it\\n\\n \"When you know something, call this number.\" He dug in a different pocket and handed her a square of\\n\\n paper like a business card. \"I\u0027ll give you a location where I can meet you-someplace away from here. We\\n\\n shouldn\u0027t talk about anything on the phone.\"\\n\\n Jez took the card. \"Thanks.\"\\n\\n \"Please be careful, Jez.\"\\n\\n \"Yes. Can I keep the articles?\"\\n\\n He snorted. \"Sure.\" Then he gave her one of those sad Old-Soul smiles. \"You probably don\u0027t need\\n\\n them, though. Just look around. Watch the news. You can see it all happening out there.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re going to stop it,\" Jez said. She reconsidered. \"We\u0027re going to try.\"\\n\\n Jez had a problem the next morning. The problem was Claire.\\n\\n They were supposed to drive to school together, to ensure that Jez didn\u0027t cut school. But Jez had to cut\\n\\n school to go find Morgead. She didn\u0027t want to imagine the kind of trouble that was going to get her in\\n\\n with Uncle Jim and Aunt Nanami-but it was crucial to get to Morgead as soon as possible. She couldn\u0027t\\n\\n afford to waste time.\\n\\n At the first major stoplight-and there weren\u0027t a lot of them in Clayton-she smacked her forehead with her\\n\\n palm.\\n\\n \"I forgot my chemistry book!\" She unfastened her seat belt and slid out of the Audi just as the light\\n\\n turned green. \"You go ahead!\" she shouted to Claire, slamming the door and leaning in the open window.\\n\\n \"Ill catch up to you.\"\\n\\n Claire\u0027s expression showed her temperature was reaching the boiling point. \"Are you crazy? Get in; I\u0027ll\\n\\n drive back\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll be late. Go on without me.\" She made a little fluttery encouraging motion with her fingers.\\n\\n One of the three cars behind Claire honked.\\n\\n Claire opened her mouth and shut it again. Her eyes were shooting sparks. \"You did this on purpose! I\\n\\n know you\u0027re up to something, Jez, and I\u0027m going to find out-\"\\n\\n Honk. Honk.\\n\\n Jez stepped back and waved goodbye.\\n\\n And Claire drove off, as Jez had known she would. Claire couldn\u0027t stand the peer pressure of cars telling\\n\\n her to get moving.\\n\\n Jez turned and began to jog for home, in a smooth, steady, ground-eating lope.\\n\\n When she got there, she wasn\u0027t even breathing hard. She opened the garage and picked up a long, slim\\n\\n bundle that had been concealed in a corner. Then she turned to her bike.\\n\\n Besides Hugh, it was the love of her life. A Harley. An 883 Sportster hugger. Just twenty-seven inches\\n\\n tall and eighty-seven inches long, a lean, light, mean machine. She loved its classic simplicity, its cold\\n\\n clean lines, its spare body. She thought of it as her steel and chrome thoroughbred.\\n\\n Now she strapped the long bundle diagonally on her back, where it balanced nicely despite its odd size.\\n\\n She put on a dark full-face helmet and swung a leg over the motorcycle. A moment later she was roaring\\n\\n away, heading out of Clayton toward San Francisco.\\n\\n She enjoyed the ride, even though she knew it might be her last one. Maybe because of that. It was a\\n\\n dazzling end-of-summer day, with a sky of September blue and a pure-white sun. The air that parted for\\n\\n Jez was warm.\\n\\n How can people ride in cages? she thought, twisting the throttle to shoot past a station wagon. What\\n\\n good are cars? You\u0027re completely isolated from your surroundings. You can\u0027t hear or smell anything\\n\\n outside; you can\u0027t feel wind or Power or a slight change in the temperature. You can\u0027t jump out to fight at\\n\\n an instant\u0027s notice. You certainly can\u0027t stake somebody at high speed while leaning out of a car window.\\n\\n You could do it from a bike, though. If you were fast enough, you could skewer somebody as you\\n\\n roared by, like a knight with a lance. She and Morgead had fought that way once.\\n\\n And maybe will again, she thought, and flashed a grim smile into the wind.\\n\\n The sky remained blue as she continued west, instead of clouding up as she approached the ocean. It\\n\\n was so clear that from Oakland she could see the entire bay and the skyline of San Francisco. The tall\\n\\n buildings looked startlingly close.\\n\\n She was leaving her own world and entering Morgead\u0027s.\\n\\n It was something she didn\u0027t do often. San Francisco was an hour and fifteen minutes away from\\n\\n Clayton-assuming there was no traffic. It might as well have been in another state. Clayton was a tiny\\n\\n rural town, mostly cows, with a few decent houses and one pumpkin farm. As far as Jez knew, the Night\\n\\n World didn\u0027t know it existed. It wasn\u0027t the kind of place Night People cared about.\\n\\n Which was why she\u0027d managed to hide there for so long.\\n\\n But now she was heading straight for the heart of the fire. As she crossed the Bay Bridge and reached\\n\\n the city, she was acutely aware of how vulnerable she was. A year ago Jez had broken the laws of the\\n\\n gang by disappearing. If any gang member saw her, they had the right to kill her.\\n\\n Idiot. Nobody can recognize you. That\u0027s why you wear the full-face helmet. That\u0027s why you keep your\\n\\n hair up. That\u0027s why you don\u0027t custom-paint the bike.\\n\\n She was still hyper-alert as she cruised the streets heading for one of the city\u0027s most unsavory districts.\\n\\n There. She felt a jolt at the sight of a familiar building. Tan, blocky, and unlovely, it rose to three stories\\n\\n plus an irregular roof. Jez squinted up at the roof without taking off her helmet.\\n\\n Then she went and stood casually against the rough concrete wall, near the rusty metal intercom. She\\n\\n waited until a couple of girls dressed like artists came up and got buzzed in by one of the tenants. Then\\n\\n she detached herself from the wall and calmly followed them.\\n\\n She couldn\u0027t let Morgead know she was coming.\\n\\n He\u0027d kill her without waiting to ask questions if he got the jump on her. Her only chance was to jump him\\n\\n first, and then make him listen.\\n\\n The building was even uglier inside than it was outside, with empty echoing stairwells and faceless\\n\\n industrial-sized hallways. But Jez found her heart beating faster and something like longing twisting in her\\n\\n chest. This place might be hideous, but it was also freedom. Each one of the giant rooms behind the metal\\n\\n doors was rented by somebody who didn\u0027t care about carpets and windows, but wanted a big empty\\n\\n space where they could be alone and do exactly what they wanted.\\n\\n It was mostly starving artists here, people who needed large studios. Some of the doors were painted in\\n\\n gemlike colors and rough textures. Most had industrial-sized locks on them.\\n\\n I don\u0027t miss it, Jez told herself. But every corner brought a shock of memory. Morgead had lived here\\n\\n for years, ever since his mother ran off with some vampire from Europe. And Jez had practically lived\\n\\n here, too, because it had been gang headquarters.\\n\\n We had some good times....\\n\\n No. She shook her head slightly to break off the thought and continued on her way, slipping silently\\n\\n through the corridors, going deeper and deeper into the building. At last she got to a place where there\\n\\n was no sound except the humming of the naked fluorescent lights on the ceiling. The walls were closer\\n\\n together here. There was a sense of isolation, of being far from the rest of the world.\\n\\n And one narrow staircase going up.\\n\\n Jez paused, listened a moment, then, keeping her eyes on the staircase, removed the long bundle from\\n\\n her back. She unwrapped it carefully, revealing a stick that was a work of art. It was just over four feet\\n\\n long and an inch in diameter. The wood was deep glossy red with irregular black markings that looked a\\n\\n little like tiger stripes or hieroglyphics.\\n\\n Snakewood. One of the hardest woods in the world, dense and strong, but with just the right amount of\\n\\n resilience for a fighting stick. It made a striking and individual weapon.\\n\\n There was one other unusual thing about it. Fighting sticks were usually blunt at either end, to allow the\\n\\n person holding it to get a grip. This one had one blunt end and one that tapered to an\\n\\n angled, narrow tip. Like a spear. The point was hard as iron and extremely sharp.\\n\\n It could punch right through clothing to penetrate a vampire heart.\\n\\n Jez held the stick in both hands for a moment, looking down at it. Then she straightened, and, holding it\\n\\n in a light grip ready for action, she began up the stairs.\\n\\n \"Ready or not, Morgead, here I come.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-huntress-night-world-7/page-6.html","bookId":1863,"book":{"id":1863,"title":"Night World : Huntress (Night World #7)","description":"Storyline: Huntress (Night World Book 7) \\n Jez Redfern is unique.
