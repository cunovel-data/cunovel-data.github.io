{"id":82097,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"I am not,\" Claire said. \"Yeah, you are,\" Jez said, still gently, as if humoring a child. \"I am not.\" \"You don\u0027t even know what it is.\" Jez looked at Hugh. \"You know what? I just realized something. The Wild Powers are all supposed to be \u0027born in the year of the blind Maiden\u0027s vision,\u0027 right?\" \"Yeah...\" \"Well, I was trying to figure that out all yesterday. And now, it just came to me, like that.\" She snapped her fingers. \"I was thinking about visions like prophecies, you know? But I think what it meant was vision, like sight. Eyesight. Aradia only had her eyesight for a year-and that\u0027s the year. Seventeen years ago.\" Hugh looked at Claire. \"And she\u0027s \"Seventeen.\" \"So what?\" Claire yelled. \"So are you! So are lots of people!\" \"So am I,\" Hugh said with a wry smile. \"But not everybody can stop a train with blue fire.\" \"I didn\u0027t stop anything,\" Claire said with passionate intensity. \"I don\u0027t know what a Wild Power is, but I didn\u0027t do anything back there. I was just lying there and I knew we were going to die-\" \"And then the blue light came and the train stopped,\" Jez said. \"You see?\" Claire shook her head. Hugh frowned and looked suddenly doubtful. \"But, Jez-what about the fire at the Marina? Claire wasn\u0027t there, was she?\" \"No. But she was watching it live on TV. And she was very, very upset about it. I\u0027ve still got the scars.\" Hugh drew in a slow breath. His eyes were unfocused. \"And you think it works across that distance?\" \"I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t see why it shouldn\u0027t.\" They were talking around Claire again, Jez gazing into the depths of the garage. \"I think maybe distance is irrelevant to it. I think what happens is that she sees something, and if she\u0027s upset enough about it, if she\u0027s desperate enough and there\u0027s no physical way to do anything, she just-sends out the Power.\" \"It\u0027s completely unconscious, then,\" Hugh said. \"And who knows, maybe she\u0027s done it before.\" Jez straightened, excited. \"If it\u0027s happening far away, and she doesn\u0027t see the flash, and she doesn\u0027t feel anything...\" She turned on Claire. \"You didn\u0027t feel anything when you stopped the train?\" \"I didn\u0027t stop the train,\" Claire said, slowly and with shaky patience. \"And I didn\u0027t do anything about that fire at the Marina, if that\u0027s what you\u0027re talking about.\" \"Claire, why are you in such total denial about this?\" \"Because it\u0027s not the truth. I know I didn\u0027t do anything, Jez. When you know, you know.\" \"Actually, I don\u0027t blame her,\" Hugh said. \"It\u0027s not a great job.\" Jez blinked, and then the truth swept over her. Her entire body went cold. Oh, Goddess... Claire. Claire\u0027s life as a normal person was over. She was going to have to leave everything, her family, her friends, and go into hiding. From this point on, she would be one of the four most important people in the world-the only of the four Wild Powers who was identified. Constantly hunted. Constantly in danger. Sought after by everyone in the Night World, for a hundred different reasons. And Claire had no experience. She was so innocent. How was she supposed to adjust to a life like that? Jez shut her eyes. Her knees were so weak that she had to sit down. \"Oh, Claire ... I\u0027m sorry.\" Claire gulped, staring at her. There was fear in her dark eyes. Hugh knelt. His expression was still and sad. Tm sorry, too,\" he said, speaking directly to Claire. \"I don\u0027t blame you at all for not wanting this. But for right now, I think we\u0027d better think about getting you someplace safe.\" Claire now had the look of somebody after an earthquake. How could this happen to me? Why wasn\u0027t I paying attention before it hit? \"I... have to go home,\" she said. But she said it very slowly, looking at Jez in fear. Jez shook her head. \"Claire-you can\u0027t I-\" She paused to gather herself, then spoke quietly and firmly. \"Home isn\u0027t safe anymore. There are going to be people looking for you-bad people.\" She glanced at Hugh. He nodded. \"A werewolf tried to run me down with a car, then jumped me. I think he must have followed me from the station. I knocked him out, but I didn\u0027t kill him.\" \"And there\u0027s the vampire from the platform,\" Jez said. \"He got away-did he see the flash?\" \"He saw everything. We were both right there, looking down at you. After that, he took off running. I\u0027m sure he\u0027s going back to report to whoever sent him.\" \"And they\u0027ll be putting everything they have on the streets, looking for us.\" Jez looked around the garage. \"We need transportation, Hugh.\" Hugh gave a tiny grin. \"Why do I have the feeling you don\u0027t mean a taxi?\" \"If you\u0027ve got a pocketknife, I can hotwire a car. But we have to make sure nobody\u0027s around. The last thing we need is the police.\" They both stood up, Jez reaching down absent-mindedly to pull Claire to her feet. Claire whispered, \"Wait. I\u0027m not ready for tins-\" Jez braced herself to be merciless. \"You\u0027re never going to be ready, Claire. Nobody is. But you have no idea what these people will do to you if they find you. You... just have no idea.\" She located a Mustang across the garage. \"That\u0027s a good one. Let\u0027s go.\" There was a loose brick in the wall near the car. Jez wrapped it in her jacket and broke the window. It only took a moment to get the door open and another few seconds to start the car. And then everybody was inside and Jez was pulling smoothly out \"Take Yanacio Boulevard to the freeway,\" Hugh said. \"We\u0027ve got to head south. There\u0027s a safe house in Fremont.\" But they never made it out of the garage. Jez saw the Volvo as she turned the first corner toward the exit It had its brights on and it was heading right for them. She twisted the wheel, trying to maneuver, but a Mustang wasn\u0027t a motorcycle. She didn\u0027t have room. She couldn\u0027t slip out and get away. The Volvo never even slowed down. And this time there was no blue light. There was a terrible crashing of metal on metal, and Jez fell into darkness. Everything hurt. Jez woke up slowly. For a long moment she had no idea where she was. Someplace-moving. She was being jolted and jarred, and that wasn\u0027t good, because she seemed to be bruised all over. Now, how had that happened... ? She remembered. And sat up so fast that it made her head spin. She found herself looking around the dim interior of a van. Dim because there were no real windows. The one in back had been covered from the outside with duct tape, and only a little light came through at the top and bottom. No light came from the front. The driver\u0027s compartment was closed off from the back by a metal wall. There were no seats in back, nothing at all to work with. Only three figures lying motionless on the floor. Claire. Hugh. And... Morgead. Jez stared, crawling forward to look at each of them. Claire looked all right. She had been in the backseat with a seat belt on. Her face was very pale, but she didn\u0027t seem to be bleeding and she was breathing evenly. Hugh looked worse. His right arm was twisted oddly under him. Jez touched it gently and determined that it was broken. And I don\u0027t have anything to set it with. And I think sbmething else is wrong with him-his breathing\u0027s raspy. Finally she looked at Morgead. He looked great. He wasn\u0027t scraped or bruised or cut like the rest of them. The only injury she could find was a huge lump on his forehead. Even as she brushed his hair back from it, he stirred. His eyes opened and Jez found herself looking into dark emeralds. \"Jez!\" He sat up, too fast. She pushed him back down. He struggled up again. \"Jez, what happened? Where are we?\" \"I was hoping you might tell me that.\" He was looking around the van, catching up fast Like any vampire, he didn\u0027t stay groggy long. \"I got hit. With wood. Somebody got me when I left my apartment.\" He looked at her sharply. \"Are you okay?\" \"Yeah. I got hit with a car. But it could be worse; it was almost a train.\" They were both looking around now, automatically in synch, searching for clues to their situation and ways to get out They didn\u0027t have to discuss it The first order of business was always escape. \"Do you have any idea who hit you?\" Jez said, running her fingers over the back door. No handles, no way to get out \"No. Pierce called to say he\u0027d come up with something on the Wild Power. I was going to meet him when suddenly I got attacked from behind.\" He was going over the metal barrier that separated them from the driver\u0027s cabin, but now he glanced at her. \"What do you mean, it was almost a train?\" \"Nothing here. Nothing on the sides. This van is stripped.\" \"Nothing here, either. What do you mean, a train?\" Jez wiggled around to face him. \"You really don\u0027t know?\" He stared at her for a moment. Either he was a fantastic actor, or he was both innocent and outraged. \"You think I would do something to hurt you?\" Jez shrugged. \"It\u0027s happened in the past.\" He glared, seemed about to get into one of his Excited States. Then he shook his head. \"I have no idea what\u0027s going on. And I would not try to hurt you.\" \"Then we\u0027re both in trouble.\" He leaned back against the metal wall. \"I believe you there.\" He was silent for a moment, then said in an odd, deliberate tone, \"It\u0027s the Council, isn\u0027t it? They found out about Hunter\u0027s deal with us, and they\u0027re moving in.\" Jez opened her mouth, shut it. Opened it again. \"Probably,\" she said. She needed Morgead. Claire and Hugh weren\u0027t fighters. And whoever had them was a formidable enemy. She didn\u0027t think it was the Council. The Council wouldn\u0027t use hired thugs; it would work through the Elders in San Francisco. And it would have no reason to kidnap Morgead; the deal with Hunter Redfern didn\u0027t really exist. Whoever it really was had a good intelligence system, good enough to discover that Morgead knew something about the Wild Power. And had a lot of money, because it had imported a lot of muscle. And had a sense of strategy, because the kidnappings of Jez and Claire and Hugh and Morgead had been beautifully timed and nicely executed. It might be some rogue vampire or werewolf chieftain who wanted to grab power. It might be some rival vampire gang in California. For all Jez knew, it might even be some insane faction of Circle Daybreak. The only thing that was certain was that she was going to have to fight them whenever this van got where it was going, and that she needed all the help she could get. So it was important to lie to Morgead one last time, and hope that he would fight with her. She had to get Claire away safely. That was all that mattered. The world would survive without her and Morgead, and even without Hugh, although it would be a darker place. But it wouldn\u0027t survive without Claire. \"Whether it\u0027s the Council or not, we\u0027re going to have to fight them,\" she said out loud. \"How\u0027s your energy-blast trick? The one you demonstrated when we were stick-fighting.\" He snorted. \"Not good. I used up all my Power fighting the guys who tackled me. It\u0027ll be a long time before I recharge.\" Jez\u0027s heart sank. \"Too bad,\" she said unemotionally. \"Because those two aren\u0027t going to be able to do much.\" \"Those humans? Who are they, by the way?\" His voice was so carefully careless again. Jez hesitated. If she said they were unimportant, he might not help her save them. But she couldn\u0027t tell the truth, either. \"That\u0027s Claire, and this is Hugh. They\u0027re-acquaintances. They\u0027ve helped me in the past.\" \"Humans?\" \"Even humans can be useful sometimes.\" \u0027I thought maybe one of them might be the Wild Power.\" \"You thought if I found the Wild Power I wouldn\u0027t tell you?\" \u0027It occurred to me.\" \"You\u0027re so cynical, Morgead.\" \u0027I prefer to call it observant,\" he said. \u0027For instance, I can tell you something about your friend Hugh, there. I saw him in the city, just once, but I remember his face. He\u0027s a damned Daybreaker.\" Jez felt a tension in her chest, but she kept her face expressionless. \"So maybe I\u0027m using him for something.\" \"And maybe,\" Morgead said, simply and pleasantly, \"you\u0027re using me.\" Jez lost her breath. She stared at him. His face was shadowed, but she could see its clean tines, the strong but delicate features, the darkness of his eyebrows and the tension in his jaw. And she knew, as he narrowed his eyes, that they were the color of glacier ice. \"You know,\" he said, \"there\u0027s still a connection between us. I can feel it, sort of like a cord between our minds. It pulls. You can\u0027t deny it, Jez. It\u0027s there whether you like it or not. And-\" He considered, as if thinking of the best way to put this. \"It tells me things. Things about you.\" Oh, hell, Jez thought. It\u0027s over. I\u0027m just going to have to protect Hugh and Claire myself. From him and whoever\u0027s got us. Part of her was scared, but part was just furious, the familiar fury of needing to bash Morgead over the head. He was so certain of himself, so ... smug. \"So what\u0027s it telling you now?\" she said sarcastically before she could stop herself. \"That you\u0027re not telling the truth. That there\u0027s something you\u0027re keeping from me, something you\u0027ve been keeping from me. And that it has to do with him.\" He nodded toward Hugh. He knew. The jerk knew and he was just playing with her. Jez could feel self-control slipping away. \"Something to do with why you want the Wild Power,\" Morgead went on, a strange smile playing on his lips. \"And with where you\u0027ve been for the past year, and with why you suddenly want to protect humans. And why you say \u0027Goddess\u0027 when you\u0027re surprised. No vampire says that. It\u0027s a witch thing.\" Goddess, I\u0027m going to kill him, Jez thought, clenching her teeth. \"Anything else?\" she said evenly. \"And with why you\u0027re scared of me reading your thoughts.\" He smirked. \"Told you I was observant.\" Jez lost it. \"Yeah, Morgead, you\u0027re brilliant. So are you smart enough to figure out what it all means? Or just to get suspicious?\" \"It means-\" He looked uncertain suddenly, as if he hadn\u0027t exactly figured out where all this was leading. He frowned. \"It means... that you\u0027re ...\" He looked at her. \"With Circle Daybreak.\" It came out as a statement, but a weak one. Almost a question. And he was staring at her with an I-don\u0027t-believe-it look. \"Very good,\" Jez said nastily. \"Two points. No, one; it took you long enough.\" Morgead stared at her. Then he suddenly erupted out of his side of the van. Jez jumped forward, too, in a crouch that would let her move fluidly and protect Hugh and Claire. But Morgead didn\u0027t attack. He just tried to grab her shoulders and shake her. \"You little idiot!\" he yelled. Jez was startled. \"What?\" \"You\u0027re a Daybreaker?\" \"I thought you had it all figured out.\" What was wrong with him? Instead of looking betrayed and bloodthirsty he looked scared and angry. Like a mother whose kid has just run in front of a bus. \"I did-I guess-but I still can\u0027t believe it. Jez, why? Don\u0027t you know how stupid that is? Don\u0027t you realize what\u0027s going to happen to them?\" \"Look, Morgead-\" \"They\u0027re going to lose, Jez. It\u0027s not just going to be the Council against them now. Everybody in the Night World is going to be gunning for them. They\u0027re going to get wiped out, and anybody who sides with them will be wiped out, too.\" His face was two inches from hers. Jez glared at him, refusing to give ground. \"I\u0027m not just siding with them,\" she hissed. \"I am one of them. I\u0027m a damned Daybreaker.\" \"You\u0027re a dead Daybreaker. I can\u0027t believe this. How am I supposed to protect you from the whole Night World?\" She stared at him. \"What?\" He settled back, glaring, but not at her. He was looking around the van, avoiding her eyes. \"You heard me. I don\u0027t care who your friends are, Jez. I don\u0027t even care that you came back to use me. I\u0027m just glad you came back. We\u0027re soulmates, and nothing can change that.\" Then he shook his head furiously. \"Even if you won\u0027t admit it.\" \"Morgead...\" Suddenly the ache in Jez\u0027s chest was too much to stay inside. It was closing off her throat, making her eyes sting, trying to make her cry. She had misjudged Morgead, too. She\u0027d been so sure that he would hate her, that he could never forgive. But of course, he didn\u0027t know the whole truth yet. He probably thought that her being a Daybreaker was something she would grow out of. That it was just a matter of getting her to see the light and change sides again, and she would become the old Jez Redfern. He didn\u0027t realize that the old Jez Red-fern had been an illusion. Tm sorry,\" she said abruptly, helplessly. \"For all of this, Morgead-I\u0027m sorry. It really wasn\u0027t fair to you for me to come back.\" He looked irritated. \"I told you; I\u0027m glad you did. We can work things out-if you\u0027ll just stop being so stubborn. We\u0027ll get out of this-\" \"Even if we do get out of it, nothing\u0027s going to change.\" She looked up at him. She wasn\u0027t frightened of what he might do anymore. The only thing she was frightened of was seeing disgust in his eyes-but she still had to tell him. \"I can\u0027t be your soulmate, Morgead.\" He hardly seemed to be listening to her. \"Yes, you can. I told you, I don\u0027t care who your friends are. Well keep you alive somehow. The only thing I don\u0027t understand is why you\u0027d want to ally yourself with stupid humans, when you know they\u0027re going to lose.\" Jez looked at him. Morgead, the vampire\u0027s vampire, whose only interest was in seeing the Night World conquer humanity completely. Who was what she had been a year ago, and what she could never be again. Who thought of her as an ally, a descendent of one of the first families of the lamia. Who thought he loved who he thought she was. Jez kept looking at him steadily, and when she spoke, it was very quietly. And it was the truth. \"Because I\u0027m a human,\" she said.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-huntress-night-world-7/page-16.html","bookId":1863,"book":{"id":1863,"title":"Night World : Huntress (Night World #7)","description":"Storyline: Huntress (Night World Book 7) Jez Redfern is unique.
