{"id":82092,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"Hey, Morgead!\" the voice was shouting even as the door went slamming and crashing open, sticking\n every few inches because it was old and warped and didn\u0027t fit the frame anymore.\n Jez had jerked around at the first noise. The connection between her and Morgead was disrupted,\n although she could feel faint echoes of the silver thread, like a guitar string vibrating after it was strummed.\n \"Hey, Morgead-\"\n \"Hey, you still asleep-?\" Several laughing, raucous people were crowding into the room. But the yelling\n stopped abruptly as they caught sight of Jez.\n There was a gasp, and then silence.\n Jez stood up to face them. She couldn\u0027t afford to feel tired anymore; every muscle was lightly tensed,\n every sense alert\n She knew the danger she was in.\n Just like Morgead, they were the flotsam and jetsam of the San Francisco streets. The orphans, the ones\n who lived with indifferent relatives, the ones nobody in the Night World really wanted. The forgotten\n Her gang.\n They were out of school and ready to rumble.\n Jez had always thought, from the day she and Morgead began picking these kids up, that the Night\n World was making a mistake in treating them like garbage. They might be young; they might not have\n families, but they had power. Every one of them had the strength to be a formidable opponent.\n And right now they were looking at her like a group of wolves looking at dinner. If they all decided to go\n for her at once, she would be in trouble. Somebody would end up getting killed.\n She faced them squarely, outwardly calm, as a quiet voice finally broke the silence.\n \"It\u0027s really you, Jez.\"\n And then another voice, from beside Jez. \"Yeah, she came back,\" Morgead said carelessly. \"She joined\n the gang again.\"\n Jez shot him the briefest of sideways glances. She hadn\u0027t expected him to help. He returned the look\n with an unreadable expression.\n \". . . she came back?\" somebody said blankly.\n Jez felt a twinge of amused sympathy. \"That\u0027s right,\" she said, keeping her face grave. \"I had to go away\n for a while, and I can\u0027t tell you where, but\n now I\u0027m back. I just fought my way back in-and I beat Morgead for the leadership.\" She figured she\n might as well get it all over with at once. She had no idea how they were going to react to the idea of her\n as leader.\n There was another long moment of silence, and then a whoop. A sound that resembled a war cry. At the\n same instant there was a violent rush toward Jez-four people all throwing themselves at her. For a\n heartbeat she stood frozen, ready to fend off a four-fold attack.\n Then arms wrapped around her waist.\n \"Jez! I missed you!\"\n Someone slapped her on the back almost hard enough to knock her down. \"You bad girl! You beat him\n again?\"\n People were trying to hug her and punch her and pat her all at once. Jez had to struggle not to show she\n was overwhelmed. She hadn\u0027t expected this of them.\n \"It\u0027s good to see you guys again,\" she said. Her voice was very slightly unsteady. And it was the truth.\n Raven Mandril said, \"You scared us when you disappeared, you know.\" Raven was the tall, willowy one\n with the marble-pale skin. Her black hair was short in back and long in front, falling over one eye and\n obscuring it. The other eye, midnight blue, gleamed at Jez.\n Jez allowed herself to gleam back, just a bit. She had always liked Raven, who was the most mature of\n the group. \"Sorry, girl.\"\n \"I wasn\u0027t scared.\" That was Thistle, still hugging Jez\u0027s waist. Thistle Galena was the delicate one who had\n stopped her aging when she reached ten. She was as old as the others, but tiny and almost weightless.\n She had feathery blond hair, amethyst eyes, and little glistening white teeth. Her specialty was playing the\n lost child and then attacking any humans who tried to help her.\n \"You\u0027re never scared,\" Jez told her, squeezing back.\n \"She means she knew you were all right, wherever you were. I did, too,\" Pierce Holt said. Pierce was\n the slender, cold boy, the one with the aristocratic face and the artist\u0027s hands. He had dark blond hair and\n deep-set eyes and he seemed to carry his own windchill factor with him. But just now he was looking at\n Jez with cool approval.\n \"I\u0027m glad somebody thought so,\" Jez said, with a glance at Morgead, who just looked condescending.\n \"Yeah, well, some people were going crazy. They thought you were dead,\" Valerian Stillman put in,\n following Jez\u0027s look. Val was the big, heroic one, with deep russet hair, gray-flecked eyes, and the build\n of a linebacker. He was usually either laughing or yelling with impatience. \"Morgead had us scouring the\n streets for you from Daly City to the Golden Gate Bridge-\"\n \"Because I was hoping a few of you would fall off,\" Morgead said without emotion. \"But I had no such\n luck. Now shut up, Val. We don\u0027t have time for all this class-reunion stuff. We\u0027ve got something\n important to do.\"\n Thistle\u0027s face lit up as she stepped back from Jez. \"You mean a hunt?\"\n \"He means the Wild Power,\" Raven said. Her one visible eye was fixed on Jez. \"He\u0027s told you already,\n hasn\u0027t he?\"\n \"I didn\u0027t need to tell her,\" Morgead said. \"She already knew. She came back because Hunter Red-fern\n wants to make a deal with us. The Wild Power for a place with him after the millennium.\"\n He got a reaction-the one Jez knew he expected. Thistle squeaked with pleasure, Raven laughed\n huskily, Pierce gave one of his cold smiles, and Val roared.\n \"He knows we\u0027ve got the real thing! He doesn\u0027t wanna mess with us!\" he shouted.\n \"That\u0027s right, Val; I\u0027m sure he\u0027s quaking in his boots,\" Morgead said. He glanced at Jez and rolled his\n Jez couldn\u0027t help but grin. This really was like old times: she and Morgead trading secret looks about\n Val. There was a strange warmth sweeping through her-not the scary tingling heat she\u0027d experienced with\n Morgead alone, but something simpler. A feeling of being with people who liked her and knew her. A\n feeling of belonging.\n She never felt that at her human school. She\u0027d seen things that would drive her human classmates insane\n even to imagine. None of them had any idea of what the real world was like-or what Jez was like, for\n that matter.\n But now she was surrounded by people who understood her. And it felt so good that it was alarming.\n She hadn\u0027t expected this, that she would slip back into the gang like a hand in a glove. Or that something\n inside her would look around and sigh and say, \"We\u0027re home.\"\n Because I am not home, she told herself sternly. These are not my people. They don\u0027t really know me,\n either....\n But they don\u0027t have to, the little sigh returned. You don\u0027t ever need to tell them you\u0027re human. There\u0027s no\n reason for them to find out.\n Jez shoved the thought away, scrunched down hard on the sighing part of her mind. And hoped it would\n stay scrunched. She tried to focus on what the others were saying.\n Thistle was talking to Morgead, showing all her small teeth as she smiled. \"So if you\u0027ve got the terms\n settled, does that mean we get to do it now? We get to pick the little girl up?\"\n \"Today? Yeah, I guess we could.\" Morgead looked at Jez. \"We know her name and everything. It\u0027s\n Iona Skelton, and she\u0027s living just a couple buildings down from where the fire was. Thistle made friends\n with her earlier this week.\"\n Jez was startled, although she kept her expression relaxed. She hadn\u0027t expected things to move this fast.\n But it might all work out for the best, she realized, her mind turning over possibilities quickly. If she could\n snatch the kid and take her back to Hugh, this whole masquerade could be over by tomorrow. She might\n even live through it.\n \"Don\u0027t get too excited,\" she warned Thistle, combing some bits of grass out of the smaller girl\u0027s silk-floss\n hair. \"Hunter wants the Wild Power alive and unharmed. He\u0027s got plans for her.\"\n \"Plus, before we take her, we\u0027ve got to test her,\" Morgead said.\n Jez controlled an urge to swallow, went on combing Thistle\u0027s hair with her fingers. \"What do you mean,\n test her?\"\n Td think that would be obvious. We can\u0027t take the chance of sending Hunter a dud. We have to make\n sure she is the Wild Power.\"\n Jez raised an eyebrow. \"I thought you were sure,\" she said, but of course she knew Morgead was right.\n She herself would have insisted Hugh find a way to test the little girl before doing anything else with her.\n The problem was that Morgead\u0027s testing was likely to be ... unpleasant.\n \"I\u0027m sure, but I still want to test her!\" Morgead snapped. \"Do you have a problem with that?\"\n \"Only if it\u0027s dangerous. For us, I mean. After all, she\u0027s got some kind of power beyond imagining, right?\"\n \"And she\u0027s in elementary school. I hardly think she\u0027s gonna be able to take on six vampires.\"\n The others were looking back and forth between Morgead and Jez like fans at a tennis match.\n \"It\u0027s just as if she never left,\" Raven said dryly, and Val bellowed laughter while Thistle giggled.\n \"They always sound so-married,\" Pierce observed, with just a tinge of spite to his cold voice.\n Jez glared at them, aware that Morgead was doing the same. \"I wouldn\u0027t marry him if every other guy on\n earth was dead,\" she informed Pierce.\n \"If it were a choice between her and a human, I\u0027d pick the human,\" Morgead put in nastily.\n Everyone laughed at that. Even Jez.\n The sun glittered on the water at the Marina. On Jez\u0027s left was a wide strip of green grass, where people\n were flying huge and colorful kites, complicated ones with dozens of rainbow tails. On the sidewalk\n people were Rollerblading and jogging and walking dogs. Everybody was wearing summer clothing;\n everybody was happy.\n It was different on the other side of the street.\n Everything changed over there. A line of pinky-brown concrete stood like a wall to mark the difference.\n There was a high school and then rows of a housing project, all the buildings identically square, flat, and\n ugly. And on the next street beyond them, there was nobody walking at all.\n Jez let Morgead take the lead on his motorcycle as he headed for those buildings. She always found this\n place depressing.\n He pulled into a narrow alley beside a store with a dilapidated sign proclaiming \"Shellfish De Lish.\" Val\n roared in after him, then Jez, then Raven with Thistle riding pillion behind her, and finally Pierce. They all\n turned off their motors.\n \"That\u0027s where she lives now; across the street,\" Morgead said. \"She and her mom are staying with her\n aunt. Nobody plays in the playground; it\u0027s too\n dangerous. But Thistle might be able to get her to come down the stairs.\"\n \"Of course I can,\" Thistle said calmly. She showed her pointed teeth in a grin.\n \"Then we can grab her and be gone before her mom even notices,\" Morgead said. \"We can take her\n back to my place and do the test where it\u0027s private.\"\n Jez breathed once to calm the knot in her stomach. \"Ill grab her,\" she said. At least that way she might\n be able to whisper something comforting to the kid. \"Thistle, you try to get her right out to the sidewalk.\n Everybody else, stay behind me-if she sees a bunch of motorcycles, she\u0027ll probably freak. But be ready\n to gun it when I pull out and grab her. The noise should help cover up any screams. Raven, you pick up\n Thistle as soon as I get the kid, and we all go straight back to Morgead\u0027s.\"\n Everyone was nodding, looking pleased with the plan-except Morgead.\n \"I think we should knock her out when we grab her. That way there won\u0027t be any screams. Not to\n mention any blue fire when she figures out she\u0027s being kidnapped-\"\n \"I already said how we\u0027re going to do it,\" Jez cut in flatly. \"I don\u0027t want her knocked out, and I don\u0027t\n think she\u0027ll be able to hurt us. Now, everybody get ready. Off you go, Thistle.\"\n As Thistle skipped across the street, Morgead let out a sharp breath. His jaw was tight.\n \"You never could take advice, Jez.\"\n \"And you never could take orders.\" She could see him starting to sizzle, but only out of the corner of her\n eye. Most of her attention was focused on the housing building.\n It was such a desolate place. No graffiti-but no grass, either. A couple of dispirited trees in front. And\n that playground with a blue metal slide and a few motorcycles-on-springs to ride ... all looking new and\n untouched.\n \"Imagine growing up in a place like this,\" she said.\n Pierce laughed oddly. \"You sound as if you feel sorry for her.\"\n Jez glanced back. There was no sympathy in his deep-set dark eyes-and none in Raven\u0027s midnight blue\n or Val\u0027s hazel ones, either. Funny, she didn\u0027t remember them being that heartless-but of course she hadn\u0027t\n been sensitive to the issue back in the old days. She would never have stopped to wonder about what\n they felt for human children.\n \"It\u0027s because it\u0027s a kid,\" Morgead said brusquely. \"It\u0027s hard on any kid growing up in a place like this.\"\n Jez glanced at him, surprised. She saw in his emerald green eyes what she\u0027d missed in the others; a kind\n of bleak pity. Then he shrugged, and the expression was gone.\n Partly to change the subject, and partly because she was curious, she said, \"Morgead? Do you know the\n prophecy with the line about the blind Maiden\u0027s vision?\"\n \"What, this one?\" He quoted:\n \"Four to stand between the light and the shadow.\n Four of blue fire, power in their blood. Born in the year of the blind Maiden\u0027s vision; Four less one and\n darkness triumphs.\"\n \"Yeah. What do you think \"born in the year of the blind Maiden\u0027s vision\u0027 means?\"\n He looked impatient. \"Well, the Maiden has to be Aradia, right?\"\n \"Who\u0027s that?\" Val interrupted, his linebacker body quivering with interest.\n Morgead gave Jez one of his humoring-Val looks. \"The Maiden of the Witches,\" he said. \"You know,\n the blind girl? The Maiden part of the Maiden, Mother, and Crone group that rules all the witches? She\u0027s\n only one of the most important people in the Night World-\"\n \"Oh, yeah. I remember.\" Val settled back.\n \"I agree,\" Jez said. \"The blind Maiden has to be Aradia. But what does the \u0027year of her vision\u0027 mean?\n How old is this kid we\u0027re snatching?\"\n \"About eight, I think.\"\n \"Did Aradia have some special vision eight years ago?\"\n Morgead was staring across the street, now, his eyebrows together. \"How should I know? She\u0027s been\n having visions since she went blind, right? Which means, like, seventeen years\u0027 worth of \u0027em. Who\u0027s\n supposed to tell which one the poem means?\"\n \"What you mean is that you haven\u0027t even tried to figure it out,\" Jez said acidly.\n He threw her an evil glance. \"You\u0027re so smart; you do it.\"\n Jez said nothing, but she made up her mind to do just that. For some reason, the poem bothered her.\n Aradia was eighteen now, and had been having visions since she lost her sight at the age of one. Some\n particular vision must have been special. Otherwise, why would it be included in the prophecy?\n It had to be important. And part of Jez\u0027s mind was worried about it.\n Just then she saw movement across the street. A brown metal door was opening and two small figures\n were coming out.\n One with feathery blond hair, the other with tiny dark braids. They were hand in hand.\n Something twisted inside Jez.\n Just stay calm, stay calm, she told herself. It\u0027s no good to think about grabbing her and making a run for\n the East Bay. They\u0027ll just follow you; track you down. Stay cool and you\u0027ll be able to get the kid free\n later.\n Yeah, after Morgead does his little \"test.\"\n But she stayed cool and didn\u0027t move, breathing slowly and evenly as Thistle led the other girl down the\n stairs. When they reached the sidewalk, Jez pressed the starter button.\n She didn\u0027t say \"Now!\" She didn\u0027t need to. She just peeled out, knowing the others would follow like a\n flock of well-trained ducklings. She heard\n their engines roar to life, sensed them behind her in tight formation, and she headed straight for the\n sidewalk.\n The Wild Power kid wasn\u0027t dumb. When she saw Jez\u0027s motorcycle coming at her, she tried to run. Her\n mistake was that she tried to save Thistle, too. She tried to pull the little blond girl with her, but Thistle\n was suddenly strong, grabbing the chain-link fence with a small hand like steel, holding them both in\n place.\n Jez swooped in and caught her target neatly around the waist. She swooped the child onto the saddle\n facing her, felt the small body thud against her, felt hands clutch at her automatically for balance.\n Then she whipped past a parked car, twisted the throttle to get a surge of speed, and flew out of there.\n Behind her, she knew Raven was snagging Thistle and the others were all following. There wasn\u0027t a\n scream or even a sound from the housing project.\n They were roaring down Taylor Street. They were passing the high school. They were making it away\n clean.\n \"Hang on to me or you\u0027ll fall off and get hurt!\" Jez yelled to the child in front of her, making a turn so fast\n that her knee almost scraped the ground. She wanted to stay far enough ahead of the others that she\n could talk.\n \"Take me back home!\" The kid yelled it, but not hysterically. She hadn\u0027t shrieked even once. Jez looked\n down at her.\n And found herself staring into deep, velvety brown eyes. Solemn eyes. They looked reproachful and\n unhappy-but not afraid.\n Jez was startled.\n She\u0027d expected crying, terror, anger. But she had the feeling that this kid wouldn\u0027t even be yelling if it\n hadn\u0027t been the only way to be heard.\n Maybe I should have been more worried about what she\u0027ll do to us. Maybe she can call blue fire down\n to kill people. Otherwise, how can she be so composed when she\u0027s just been kidnapped?\n But those brown eyes-they weren\u0027t the eyes of somebody about to attack. They were-Jez didn\u0027t know\n what they were. But they wrenched her heart.\n \"Look-Iona, right? That\u0027s your name?\"\n The kid nodded.\n \"Look, Iona, I know this seems weird and scary- having somebody just grab you off the street. And I\n can\u0027t explain everything now. But I promise you, you\u0027re not going to get hurt. Nothing\u0027s going to hurt\n you-okay?\"\n \"I want to go home.\"\n Oh, kid, so do I, Jez thought suddenly. She had to blink hard. Tm going to take you home-or at least\n someplace safe,\" she added, as honesty unexpectedly kicked in. There was something about the kid that\n made her not want to lie. \"But first we\u0027ve got to go to a friend of mine\u0027s house. But, look, no matter how\n strange all this seems, I want you to remember something. I won\u0027t let you get hurt. Okay? Can you\n believe that?\"\n \"My mom is going to be scared.\"\n Jez took a deep breath and headed onto the freeway. \"I promise I won\u0027t let you get hurt,\" she said again.\n And that was all she could say.\n She felt like a centaur, some creature that was half person and half steel horse, carrying off a human kid\n at sixty miles an hour. It was pointless to try to make conversation on the freeway, and Iona didn\u0027t speak\n again until they were roaring up to Morgead\u0027s building.\n Then she said simply, \"I don\u0027t want to go in there.\"\n \"It\u0027s not a bad place,\" Jez said, braking front and back. \"We\u0027re going up on the roof. There\u0027s a little\n garden there.\"\n A tiny flicker of interest showed in the solemn brown eyes. Four other bikes pulled in beside Jez.\n \"Yeeehaw! We got her!\" Val yelled, pulling off his helmet.\n \"Yeah, and we\u0027d better take her upstairs before somebody sees us,\" Raven said, tossing her dark hair so\n it fell over one eye again.\n Thistle was climbing off the back of Raven\u0027s motorcycle. Jez felt the small body in front of her stiffen.\n Thistle looked at Iona and smiled her sharp-toothed smile.\n Iona just looked back. She didn\u0027t say a word, but after a minute Thistle flushed and turned away.\n \"So now we\u0027re going to test her, right? It\u0027s time to test her, isn\u0027t it, Morgead?\"\n Jez had never heard Thistle\u0027s voice so shrill-so\n disturbed. She glanced down at the child in front of her, but Morgead was speaking.\n \"Yeah, it\u0027s time to test her,\" he said, sounding unexpectedly tired for somebody who\u0027d just pulled off\n such a triumph. Who\u0027d just caught a Wild Power that was going to make his career. \"Let\u0027s get it over\n with.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-huntress-night-world-7/page-11.html","bookId":1863,"book":{"id":1863,"title":"Night World : Huntress (Night World #7)","description":"Storyline: \n Huntress (Night World Book 7) \n Jez Redfern is unique.
