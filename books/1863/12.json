{"id":82093,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"Jez kept one hand on the kid as they walked up the stairs under the dirty fluorescent bulbs. She could\n only imagine what Iona must be thinking as they shepherded her to the top.\n They came out on the roof into slanting afternoon sunlight. Jez gave Iona\u0027s shoulder a little squeeze.\n \"See-there\u0027s the garden.\" She nodded toward a potted palm and three wooden barrels with\n miscellaneous wilted leaves in them. Iona glanced that way, then gave Jez a sober look.\n \"They\u0027re not getting enough water,\" she said as quietly as she said everything.\n \"Yeah, well, it didn\u0027t rain enough this summer,\" Morgead said. \"You want to fix that?\"\n Iona just looked seriously at him.\n \"Look, what I mean is, you\u0027ve got the Power, right? So if you just want to show us right now, anything\n you want, be my guest. It\u0027ll make things a lot simpler. Make it rain, why don\u0027t you?\"\n Iona looked right at him. \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about.\"\n \"I\u0027m just saying that there\u0027s no reason for you to get hurt here. We just want to see you do something like\n what you did the night of the fire. Anything. Just show us.\"\n Jez watched him. There was something incongruous about the scene: Morgead in his high boots and\n leather jacket, iron-muscled, sleek, sinewy, on one knee in front of this harmless-looking kid in pink\n pants. And the kid just looking back at him with her sad and distant eyes.\n \"I guess you\u0027re crazy,\" Iona said softly. Her pigtails moved as she shook her head. A pink ribbon\n fluttered loosely.\n \"Do you remember the fire?\" Jez said from behind her.\n \"Course.\" The kid turned slowly around. \"I was scared.\"\n \"But you didn\u0027t get hurt. The fire got close to you and then you did something. And then the fire went\n away.\"\n \"I was scared, and then the fire went away. But I didn\u0027t do anything.\"\n \"Okay,\" Morgead said. He stood. \"Maybe if you can\u0027t tell us, you can show us.\"\n Before Jez could say anything, he was picking up the little girl up and carrying her. He had to step\n over a line of debris that stretched like a diagonal wall from one side of the roof to the other. It was\n composed of telephone books, splintery logs, old clothes, and other odds and ends, and it formed a\n barrier, blocking off a corner of the roof from the rest.\n He put Iona in the triangle beyond the debris. Then he stepped back over the wall, leaving her there.\n Iona didn\u0027t say anything, didn\u0027t try to follow him back out of the triangle.\n Jez stood tensely. The kid\u0027s a Wild Power, she told herself. She\u0027s already survived worse than this. And\n no matter what happens, she\u0027s not going to get hurt.\n I promised her that.\n But she would have liked to be telepathic again just for a few minutes, just to tell the kid one more time\n not to be scared. She especially wanted to as Val and Raven poured gasoline on the wall of debris. Iona\n watched them do it with huge sober eyes, still not moving.\n Then Pierce lit a match.\n . The flames leaped up yellow and blue. Not the bright orange they would have been at night.\n But hot. They spread fast and Jez could feel the heat from where she was standing, ten feet away.\n The kid was closer.\n She still didn\u0027t say anything, didn\u0027t try to jump over the flames while they were low. In a few moments\n they were high enough that she couldn\u0027t jump through them without setting herself on fire.\n Okay, Jez thought, knowing the kid couldn\u0027t hear her. Now, do it! Come on, Iona. Put the fire out.\n Iona just looked at it.\n She was standing absolutely still, with her little hands curled into fists at her sides. A small and lonely\n figure, with the late afternoon sun making a soft red halo around her head and the hot wind from the fire\n rippling her pink-trimmed shirt. She faced the flames dead-on, but not aggressively, not as if she were\n planning to fight them.\n Damn; this is wrong, Jez thought. Her own hands were clenched into fists so tightly that her nails were\n biting into her palms.\n \"You know, I\u0027m concerned,\" Pierce said softly from just behind her. \"I have a concern here.\"\n Jez glanced at him quickly. Pierce didn\u0027t talk a lot, and he always seemed the coldest of the group-aside\n from Morgead, of course, who could be colder than anyone. Now Jez wondered. Could he, who never\n seemed to be moved by pity, actually be the most sensitive?\n \"I\u0027m worried about this fire. I know nobody can look down on us, but it\u0027s making a lot of smoke. What if\n one of the other tenants comes up to investigate?\"\n Jez almost hit him.\n This is not my home, she thought, and felt the part of her that had sighed and felt loved and understood\n wither away. These are not my people. I don\u0027t belong with them.\n And Pierce wasn\u0027t worth hitting. She turned her back on him to look at Iona again. She was dimly aware\n of Morgead telling him to shut up, that other tenants were the least of their worries, but most of her\n attention was focused on the kid.\n Come on, kid! she thought. Then she said it out loud.\n \"Come on, Iona! Put out the fire. You can do it! Just do what you did before!\" She tried to catch the\n child\u0027s eye, but Iona was looking at the flames. She seemed to be trembling now.\n \"Yeah, come on!\" Morgead said brusquely. \"Let\u0027s get this over with, kid.\"\n Raven leaned forward, her long front hair ruffling in the wind. \"Do you remember what you did that\n night?\" she shouted seriously. \"Think!\"\n Iona looked at her and spoke for the first time. \"I didn\u0027t do anything!\" Her voice, so composed before,\n was edging on tears.\n The fire was full-blown now, loud as a roaring wind, sending little bits of burning debris into the air. One\n floated down to rest at Iona\u0027s foot and she stepped backward.\n She\u0027s got to be scared, Jez told herself. That\u0027s the whole point of this test. If she\u0027s not scared, she\u0027ll never\n be able to find her Power. And we\u0027re talking about saving the world, here. We\u0027re not just torturing this\n kid for fun.... It\u0027s still wrong.\n The thought burst out from some deep part of her. Jez had seen a lot of horrible things as a vampire and\n a vampire hunter, but suddenly she knew she couldn\u0027t watch any more of this. I\u0027m going to call it off.\n She looked at Morgead. He was standing tensely, arms folded over his chest, green eyes fixed on Iona\n as if he could will her into doing what he wanted. Raven and Val were beside him, Raven expressionless\n under her fall of dark hair; Val frowning with his big hands on his hips. Thistle was a step or so behind\n them.\n \"It\u0027s time to stop,\" Jez said.\n Morgead\u0027s head whipped around to look at her. \"No. We\u0027ve gotten this far; it would be stupid to have\n to start all over again. Would that be any nicer to her?\"\n \"I said, it\u0027s time to stop. What do you have to put out the fire-or did you even think of that?\"\n As they were talking, Thistle stepped forward. She moved right up to the flames, staring at Iona.\n \"You\u0027d better do something fast,\" she shouted. \"Or you\u0027re going to burn right up.\"\n The childish, taunting tone caught Jez\u0027s attention, but Morgead was talking to her.\n \"She\u0027s going to put it out any minute now. She just has to be frightened enough-\"\n \"Morgead, she\u0027s absolutely terrified already! Look at her!\"\n Morgead turned. Iona\u0027s clenched fists were now raised to chest-level; her mouth was slightly open as\n she breathed far too fast. And although she wasn\u0027t screaming or crying like a normal kid, Jez could see\n the tremors running through her little body. She looked like a small trapped animal.\n \"If she\u0027s not doing it now, she\u0027s never going to,\"\n Jez told Morgead flatly. \"It was a stupid idea in the first place, and it\u0027s over!\"\n She saw the change in his green eyes; the flare of anger and then the sudden darkness of defeat. She\n realized that he was going to cave.\n But before he could say anything, Thistle moved forward.\n \"You\u0027re gonna die!\" she shrilled. \"You\u0027re gonna burn up right now!\" And she began kicking flaming\n debris at Iona.\n Everything happened very fast after that.\n The debris came apart in a shower of sparks as it flew toward Iona. Iona\u0027s mouth came open in horror\n as she found fiery garbage swirling around her knees. And then Raven was yelling at Thistle, but Thistle\n was already kicking more.\n A second deluge of sparks hit Iona. Jez saw her put up her hands to protect her face, then fling her arms\n out as a piece of burning cloth settled on her sleeve. She saw the sleeve spurt with a tiny flame. She saw\n Iona cast a frantic look around, searching for a way to escape.\n Morgead was dragging Thistle back by her collar. Thistle was still kicking. Sparks were everywhere and\n Jez felt a hot pain on her cheek.\n And then Iona\u0027s eyes went enormous and blank and fixed and Jez could see that she\u0027d made some\n decision, she\u0027d found some way to get out of this.\n Only not the right one.\n She was going to jump.\n Jez saw Iona turn toward the edge of the roof, and she knew in that same instant that she couldn\u0027t get to\n the child in time to stop her.\n So there was only one thing to do.\n Jez only hoped she would be fast enough.\n She very nearly wasn\u0027t. But there was a two-foot wall at the roof\u0027s perimeter, and it delayed Iona for a\n second as she scrambled onto it. That gave Jez a second to leap through the fire and catch up.\n And then Iona was on the wall, and then she was launching her small body into empty space. She\n jumped like a flying squirrel, arms and legs outspread, looking down at the three-story drop.\n Jez jumped with her.\n Jez! The telepathic shout followed her, but Jez scarcely heard it. She had no idea who had even said it.\n Her entire consciousness was focused on Iona.\n Maybe some part of her was still hoping that the kid had magic and could make the wind hold her up.\n But it didn\u0027t happen and Jez didn\u0027t waste time thinking about it. She hit Iona in midair, grabbing the small\n It was something no human could have done. Jez\u0027s vampire muscles instinctively knew how to handle\n this, though. They twisted her as she fell, putting her underneath the child in her arms, putting her legs\n below her like a cat\u0027s.\n But of course Jez didn\u0027t have a vampire\u0027s resistance to injury. She knew perfectly well that when she hit,\n the fall would break both her legs. In her weakened state it might well kill her.\n It should save the kid, though, she thought unemotionally as the ground rushed up to meet her. The extra\n resiliency of Jez\u0027s flesh would act as a cushion.\n But there was one thing Jez hadn\u0027t thought of.\n The trees.\n There were discouraged-looking redbud trees planted at regular intervals along the cracked and mossy\n sidewalk. None of them had too much in the way of foliage even in late summer, but they certainly had a\n lot of little branches.\n Jez and the kid crashed right into one of them.\n Jez felt pain, but scratching, stabbing pain instead of the slamming agony of hitting the sidewalk. Her legs\n were smashing through things that cracked and snapped and poked her. Twigs and branches. She was\n being flipped around as some of the twigs caught on her jeans and others snagged her leather jacket.\n Every branch she hit decreased her velocity.\n So when she finally crashed out of the tree and hit concrete, it merely knocked the wind out of her.\n Black dots danced in front of her eyes. Then her vision cleared and she realized that she was lying on her\n back with Iona clutched to her stomach. Shiny redbud leaves were floating down all around her.\n Goddess, she thought. We made it. I don\u0027t believe it.\n There was a dark blur and something thudded against the sidewalk beside her.\n Morgead. He landed like a cat, bending his knees, but nice a big cat. A three-story jump was pretty\n steep even for a vampire. Jez could see the shock reverberate through him as his legs hit concrete, and\n then he fell forward.\n That must hurt, she thought with distant sympathy. But the next instant he was up again, he was by her\n side and bending over her.\n \"Are you all right?\" He was yelling it both aloud and telepathically. His dark hair was mussed and flying;\n his green eyes were wild. \"Jez!\"\n Oh. It was you who yelled when I jumped, Jez thought. I should have known.\n She blinked up at him. \"Of course I\u0027m all right,\" she said hazily. She tugged at the kid lying on her. \"Iona!\n Are you all right?\"\n Iona stirred. Both her hands were clutching Jez\u0027s jacket in front, but she sat up a little without letting go.\n There was a burned patch on her sleeve, but no fire.\n Her velvety brown eyes were huge-and misty. She looked sad and confused.\n \"That was really scary,\" she said.\n \"I know.\" Jez gulped. She wasn\u0027t any good at talking about emotional things, but right now the words\n spilled out without conscious effort. Tm sorry, Iona; I\u0027m so sorry, I\u0027m so sorry. We shouldn\u0027t have done\n that. It was a very bad thing to do, and I\u0027m really sorry, and we\u0027re going to take you home now.\n Nobody\u0027s going to hurt you. We\u0027re going to take you back to your mom.\"\n The velvety eyes were still unhappy. Tired and unhappy and reproachful. Jez had never felt like more of\n a monster, not even that night in Muir Woods when she had realized she was hunting her own kind.\n Iona\u0027s gaze remained steady, but her chin quivered.\n Jez looked at Morgead. \"Can you erase her memory? I can\u0027t see any reason why she should have to\n remember all this.\"\n He was still breathing quickly, his face pale and his pupils dilated. But he looked at Iona and nodded.\n \"Yeah, I can wipe her.\"\n \"Because she\u0027s not the Wild Power, you know,\" Jez said levelly, as if making a comment about the\n weather.\n Morgead flinched. Then he shoved his hair back with his knuckles, his eyes shutting briefly.\n \"She\u0027s an extraordinary kid, and I don\u0027t know exactly what she\u0027s going to be-maybe President or some\n great doctor or botanist or something. Something special, because she\u0027s got that inner light- something\n that keeps her from getting mad or mean or hysterical. But that\u0027s got nothing to do with being a Wild\n Power.\"\n \"All right! I know, already!\" Morgead yelled, and Jez realized she was babbling. She shut up.\n Morgead took a breath and put his hand down. \"She\u0027s not it. I was wrong. I made a bad mistake.\n Okay?\"\n \"Okay.\" Jez felt calmer now. \"So can you please wipe her?\"\n \"Yes! I\u0027m doing it!\" Morgead put his hands on Iona\u0027s slender shoulders. \"Look, kid, I\u0027m-sorry. I never\n thought you\u0027d-you know, jump like that.\"\n Iona didn\u0027t say anything. If he wanted forgiveness, he wasn\u0027t getting it.\n He took a deep breath and went on. \"This has been a pretty rotten day, hasn\u0027t it? So why don\u0027t you just\n forget all about it, and before you know it, you\u0027ll be home.\"\n Jez could feel him reach out with his mind, touching the child\u0027s consciousness with his Power. Iona\u0027s eyes\n shifted, she looked at Jez uncertainly.\n \"It\u0027s okay,\" Jez whispered. \"It won\u0027t hurt.\" She hung on to Iona\u0027s gaze, trying to comfort her as\n Morgead\u0027s suggestions took hold.\n \"You don\u0027t ever have to remember this,\" Morgead said, his voice soothing now. Gentle. \"So why don\u0027t\n you just go to sleep? You can have a little nap... and when you wake up, you\u0027ll be home.\"\n Iona\u0027s eyelids were closing. At the last possible second she gave Jez a tiny sleepy smile-just the barest\n change of expression, but it seemed to ease the tightness in Jez\u0027s chest. And then Iona\u0027s lashes were lying\n heavy on her cheeks and her breathing was deep and regular.\n Jez sat up and gently put the sleeping child on the sidewalk. She smoothed back one stray pigtail and\n watched the little chest rise and fall a couple of times. Then she looked up at Morgead.\n \"Thanks.\"\n He shrugged, exhaling sharply. \"It was the least I could do.\" Then he gave her an odd glance.\n Jez thought of it at the same instant. She was the one so concerned about the child-why had she asked\n Morgead to wipe her memory?\n Because I can\u0027t do it, she thought dryly. Out loud she said, \"I\u0027m really kind of tired, after everything that\u0027s\n happened today. I don\u0027t have much Power left.\"\n \"Yeah...\" But his green eyes were slightly narrowed, searching.\n \"Plus, I hurt.\" Jez stretched, gingerly testing her muscles, feeling every part of her protest.\n The searching look vanished instantly. Morgead leaned forward and began to go over her with light,\n expert fingers, his eyes worried.\n \"Can you move everything? What about your legs? Do you feel numb anywhere?\"\n \"I can move everything, and I only wish I felt numb somewhere.\"\n \"Jez-I\u0027m sorry.\" He blurted it out as awkwardly as he had to the child. \u0027I didn\u0027t mean ... I mean, this just\n hasn\u0027t turned out the way I planned. The kid getting hurt-you getting hurt. It just wasn\u0027t what I had in\n mind.\"\n The kid getting hurt? Jez thought. Don\u0027t tell me you care about that.\n But there was no reason for Morgead to lie. And he did look unhappy-probably more unhappy than Jez\n had ever seen him. His eyes were still all pupil, as if he were scared.\n I\u0027m not hurt,\" Jez said. It was all she could think of. She felt dizzy suddenly-uncertain and a little giddy,\n as if she were still tumbling off the roof.\n \"Yes, you are.\" He said it with automatic stubbornness, as if it were one of their arguments. But his hand\n reached out to touch her cheek.\n The one that had been hit by burning debris. It hurt, but Morgead was touching so lightly.... Coolness\n seemed to flow from his fingers, seeping into the burn and making it feel better.\n Jez gasped. \"Morgead-what are you doing?\"\n \"Giving you some Power. You\u0027re low and you need it.\"\n Giving her Power? She\u0027d never heard of such a thing. But he was doing it. She could feel her skin healing\n itself faster, could feel his strength pour into her.\n It was a strange sensation. It made her shiver inwardly.\n \"Morgead...\"\n His eyes were fixed on her face. And suddenly they were all Jez could see; the rest of the world was a\n blur. All she could hear was the soft catch in his breath; all she could feel was the gentleness of his touch.\n \"Jez...\"\n They were leaning toward each other, or falling. It was that silver thread between them, shortening,\n pulling. They had nothing to grab on to but each other. And then Morgead\u0027s arms were around her and\n she felt his warm mouth touch hers. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-huntress-night-world-7/page-12.html","bookId":1863,"book":{"id":1863,"title":"Night World : Huntress (Night World #7)","description":"Storyline: \n Huntress (Night World Book 7) \n Jez Redfern is unique.
