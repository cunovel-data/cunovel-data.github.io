{"id":82094,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"The kiss was warm and sweet. Not frightening. Jez felt herself relax in Morgead\u0027s arms before she knew\n what she was doing. His heart was beating so fast against hers. She felt dizzy, but safe, too; a wonderful\n feeling.\n But the approach of his mind was another thing. It was just like the first time: that terrible, irresistible pull\n trying to suck her soul out and mix it with Morgead\u0027s until they were both one person. Until he knew her\n every secret and she had no place to hide.\n And the worst thing Was that she knew it wasn\u0027t Morgead doing it. It was that outside force doing it to\n both of them, carrying them along helplessly.\n Whether we want it or not. And we don\u0027t want it, Jez told herself desperately. We both hate it. Neither\n of us wants to share our souls....\n But then why was he still holding her, still kissing her? And why was she letting him?\n At that instant she felt his mind touch hers, reaching through the smoke-screen of protection she\u0027d\n thrown around herself to brush her thoughts as lightly as a moth\u0027s wing. She recognized Morgead\u0027s\n essence in it; she could feel his soul, dark and bright and full of fierce emotion for her. He was opening\n himself to her; not trying to fight this or even holding back. He was going farther than the pull forced him\n to, giving himself to her freely....\n It was a gift that sent her reeling. And she couldn\u0027t resist it. Her mind flowed out of its own accord to\n touch his, tendrils of thought wrapping around his gratefully. The shock of pleasure when she let it happen\n was frightening-except that she couldn\u0027t be frightened anymore, not now.\n And then she felt him respond, felt his happiness, felt his thoughts enfolding hers, holding her mind as\n gently as his arms held her body. And white light exploded behind her eyes....\n Jez! Morgead! What\u0027s wrong with you two?\n The thought was foreign, cold, and unwanted. It broke into Jez\u0027s warm little world and rattled around\n annoyingly. Jez tried to push it away.\n Hey, look; I\u0027m just trying to help. If you guys are alive, then, like give us a sign, okay?\n Morgead made a sound like a mental groan. It\u0027s Vol. I have to kill him.\n I\u0027m going to help, Jez told him. Then something occurred to her. Oh-wait. Where are we... ?\n It was a good question. A weird but necessary question. It took them a moment to untangle their\n thoughts from each other and rise back to the real world.\n Where they seemed to be sitting under the ruins of a redbud tree, arms around each other, Jez\u0027s head on\n Morgead\u0027s shoulder, Morgead\u0027s face pressed into Jez\u0027s hair.\n At least we weren\u0027t still kissing, Jez thought abstractedly. She could feel herself flushing scarlet. The rest\n of the gang was standing around them, looking down with worried expressions.\n \"What do you guys want?\" Morgead said brusquely.\n \"What do we want?\" Raven leaned forward, dark hair swinging. Jez actually saw both her midnight blue\n eyes underneath. \"You three jumped off the roof just as the fire got out of control. We put it out and\n came down to see if you were still alive- and then we find you here hanging on to each other and totally\n out of it. And you want to know what we want? We want to know if you\u0027re okay.\"\n \"We\u0027re fine,\" Morgead said. He didn\u0027t say anything more, and Jez understood. Neither of them had any\n desire to talk about it in front of other people. That could wait until they were alone, until it was the right\n time.\n They didn\u0027t need to express this to each other. Jez simply knew, and knew that he knew.\n \"What about her?\" Thistle pointed to Iona, still asleep on the sidewalk.\n Jez was already moving to the child. She checked the little body over, noted the even breathing and the\n peaceful expression.\n \"She\u0027s fine, too,\" she said, settling back. She held Thistle\u0027s gaze. \"No thanks to you.\"\n Thistle\u0027s cheeks were pink. She looked angry, embarrassed, and defensive. \"She\u0027s just a human.\"\n \"She\u0027s a kid!\" Morgead yelled, shooting up to his feet. He towered over Thistle, who suddenly looked\n very small. \"Which you\u0027re not,\" he went on unsym-pathetically. \"You\u0027re just a-a sixteen-year-old Shirley\n Temple-wannabe.\"\n \"All right, both of you!\" Jez said sharply. She waited until they shut up and looked at her before\n continuing. \"You-be quiet and let me take care of things,\" she said to Morgead. \"And you-if you ever try\n to hurt a kid again, I\u0027ll knock your head off.\" This to Thistle, who opened her mouth, but then shut it again\n without speaking.\n Jez nodded. \"Okay, that\u0027s settled. Now we\u0027ve got to get this girl home.\"\n Val stared at her. \"Home?\"\n \"Yeah, Val.\" Jez picked the child up. \"In case you missed something, she\u0027s not the Wild Power.\"\n \"But...\" Val wriggled his broad shoulders uncomfortably and looked at Morgead. \"You mean you\n were wrong?\"\n \"There\u0027s a first time for everything, right?\" Morgead glared at him.\n \"But, then-who is the Wild Power?\" Raven put in quietly.\n \"Who knows?\" It was the first time Pierce had spoken, and his voice was low and distantly amused.\n Jez glanced at him. His blond hair glinted in the red light of the sunset, and his dark eyes were mocking.\n I really don\u0027t think I like you much, she thought.\n But of course he was right \"If this kid isn\u0027t the one-well, I guess it could have been anybody at the\n scene,\" she said slowly. \"Anybody worried enough to want to save her. One of the firefighters, a\n neighbor-anybody.\"\n \"Assuming the blue flash on the tape really was evidence of a Wild Power,\" Pierce said.\n \"I think it was.\" Jez glanced at Morgead. \"It sure looked like blue fire. And it certainly was some kind of\n Power.\"\n \"And Grandma Harman dreamed about the Wild Power being in San Francisco,\" Morgead added. \u0027It all\n fits too well.\" He looked at Jez slyly. \"But it couldn\u0027t have been anybody at the scene, you know.\"\n \"Why not?\"\n \"Because of what you said about that line in the prophecy. \u0027Born in the year of the blind Maiden\u0027s vision.\u0027\n That means it has to be somebody born less than eighteen years ago. Before that, Aradia couldn\u0027t have\n visions because she wasn\u0027t alive.\"\n Goddess, I\u0027m slow today, Jez thought. I should have thought of that. She gave him a wry nod of\n respect and he returned it with a grin. Not maliciously.\n \"It\u0027s still not much to go on,\" Raven said in her pragmatic way. \"But don\u0027t you think we should go back\n inside to discuss it? Somebody\u0027s going to come along eventually and see us with an unconscious kid.\"\n \"Good point,\" Jez said. \"But I\u0027m not going up with you. I\u0027m taking the kid home.\"\n \"Me, too,\" Morgead said. Jez glanced at him; he had his stubborn expression on.\n \"Okay, but just us. Two motorcycles are going to be conspicuous enough.\" She turned to Raven. \"The\n rest of you can do what you want tonight; try to figure out who the Wild Power is or whatever. Well\n meet again tomorrow and see what we\u0027ve come up with.\"\n \"Why wait?\" Val said. \"It\u0027s only dusk. We could meet tonight-\"\n Tm tired,\" Jez cut in. \u0027It\u0027s enough for the day.\" And Goddess knows how I\u0027m going to explain being gone\n this long to Aunt Nan, she thought wearily. Not to mention missing school.\n Pierce was watching her with an odd expression. \"So you\u0027ll have to report to Hunter that we failed,\" he\n said, and there was a probing tone in his voice that Jez didn\u0027t like.\n \"Yeah, I\u0027ll tell him you screwed up,\" she said heavily. \"But that we still have some options. Unless you\u0027d\n rather I just tell him that you\u0027re all idiots and not worth giving a second chance.\" She kept looking at\n Pierce until he looked away.\n When she turned to Morgead he was scowling, but he didn\u0027t say anything. He silently started toward\n their bikes.\n They couldn\u0027t talk while they were riding. Jez was too full of her own thoughts anyway.\n She was finally free to consider those last minutes with Morgead.\n It had been... amazing. Electrifying. But also enlightening.\n She knew now what had happened to them, what was happening. He had been right. It was the\n soul-mate principle.\n So we\u0027re soulmates. Morgead and I. After all our fighting and challenging each other and everything. It\u0027s\n so strange, but in a way it makes sense, too....\n And it\u0027s really a pity that even if we both survive the next week or so, we\u0027re never going to see each\n other again.\n The thought came from some deep part of her that was utterly heartless and practical and saw everything\n in the cold light of truth.\n Because unfortunately the universe had picked the wrong person for Jez to be soulmates with. It had\n picked one that would hate her and want to kill her once he realized what she really was.\n Bad mistake, universe, Jez thought, biting down on a laugh. She realized, dimly, that she was verging on\n being hysterical.\n It had been such a long day, and she was so tired, and so hurt, and she\u0027d failed in her mission, and now\n Morgead was in love with her, but there was just no hope. Small wonder she was punchy and an\n emotional wreck. She was lucky not to be railing off her bike.\n There really was no hope. Even in that last encounter, even when Morgead had been revealing his soul\n to her, Jez had managed to keep her own secrets buried. He didn\u0027t know. He had no idea that the girl he\n was in love with was vermin. Was working with Circle Daybreak. Was lying to him to steal the Wild\n Power out from under his nose and end the hopes of the vampires for a world without humans.\n He was ambitious, she had always known that. All he\u0027d ever cared about was climbing higher and getting\n more power. She\u0027d promised him a position in the new world order-while all the time she was working as\n hard as she could to make sure that the new world order never came.\n He would never forgive that deception. He would never even be able to understand why she had done\n it.\n So you have to forget about him, the cold-and-practical part of her mind said quietly. And there was\n nothing inside Jez that even tried to argue.\n It was dark by the time they reached the Marina district. As they approached the housing project, Jez\n saw flashing lights ahead.\n Police car lights. Well, that wasn\u0027t unexpected. Iona\u0027s mother would have notified them by now. Jez just\n hoped she wasn\u0027t too worried....\n Idiot! her mind said sarcastically. How worried do you expect her to be, with it getting dark and her\n eight-year-old missing?\n She turned into an alley and Morgead followed her.\n \"Well have to do a drive-by,\" she said over the thrum of the engines. \"Drop her by the police cars and\n then shoot out of there. They\u0027ll probably chase us. Are you up for it?\"\n He nodded. \"We should go separate ways. That\u0027ll make it harder for them to catch us.\"\n \"Right. You go on home once you lose them. So will I.\"\n She couldn\u0027t see his features clearly in the dark alley, but she knew he was looking at her. \"So will you?\n Go home?\"\n \"I mean I\u0027ll go to the place where I\u0027m staying.\"\n She expected him to ask about that, try to find out where it was, what she was doing. He didn\u0027t Instead\n he said, \"Do you have to?\"\n She bunked at him, startled. Then she frowned. \"Yes, I have to. I want to. I\u0027m tired, Morgead, and\n anyway I\u0027m not ready to be spending the night with a guy.\"\n \"I didn\u0027t mean that-\"\n Jez waved a hand. \"I know. I\u0027m sorry. But I\u0027m still tired, and-\" And I\u0027ve got other responsibilities that\n you don\u0027t understand. And if I stick around you any longer, while I\u0027m this tired, I\u0027m afraid that you\u0027re\n going to find out what they are.\n \"And you\u0027re still mad,\" he said bleakly.\n Tm not mad-\"\n \"Or disgusted or whatever.\"\n What was he talking about? Tm just tired,\" she\n said firmly. \"Now let\u0027s drop the kid off, and I\u0027ll see you tomorrow.\"\n \"I-\" He let out his breath violently. \"All right.\"\n Jez didn\u0027t waste any more time. She unzipped her jacket, which had been holding Iona firmly against her.\n Then she sped out into the street.\n One block, two blocks. And now she was right beside the dark and deserted playground, and now she\n was almost level with the police cars. There were several officers standing around talking, and several\n other bystanders who might be neighbors.\n Jez targeted one of the neighbors.\n She swooped in toward the woman, who was on the outside edge of the sidewalk. She came up fast,\n then hit the brakes.\n \"Hey,\" she said. \"Here.\"\n The woman turned around and her jaw dropped. Jez didn\u0027t hesitate, just bundled Iona into her arms.\n The woman grabbed the child\u0027s weight automatically.\n \"Give her to her mom, okay?\"\n And then Jez was roaring out and away. She could hear Morgead behind her, and shouts from the\n housing project. Then a police siren.\n She glanced back. Morgead was just turning on a side street. He waved once at her, and then he was\n speeding off.\n Jez could hear more sirens now. She twisted the throttle and headed for the Bay Bridge.\n At least a pursuit was something she could enjoy.\n When she finally shook the police cars tailing her, she turned toward Clayton. She would have\n been worried about what her aunt and uncle were going to say if she hadn\u0027t already been too worried\n about Iona.\n She\u0027ll be all right, she told herself. She shouldn\u0027t remember anything, and her mom will take care of her.\n But Jez couldn\u0027t help but feel guilty... and just plain sad. There was some sort of bond between her\n and the child. She felt-responsible for her, and not just because she\u0027d kidnapped and terrorized her.\n Nobody should have to grow up in that kind of place. I may have run around on the streets when I was\n little, but at least I had Uncle Bracken, and a nice home to go to if I wanted. Iona-she doesn\u0027t even have\n a safe playground.\n I should do something for her, but what can I do that would matter?\n I don\u0027t know; maybe I can visit her sometime. Maybe I can buy her a plant....\n There weren\u0027t any easy answers, and she was drawing up to a neat yellow frame house.\n Home.\n Time, Jez thought, to face the music. Uncle Jim and Aunt Nan and nasty little Claire. She just hoped they\n left enough of her alive so that she could call Hugh afterward.\n She pulled her motorcycle into the garage, climbed off, and went inside.\n \"... at all is bad enough, But to do it the day after you make us a promise-well, what are we supposed to\n think? How are we supposed to trust you again?\"\n Jez was sitting on the blue floral couch in the living room. The Goddard living room didn\u0027t get used much,\n only for very formal occasions.\n This was one of them. It was a court martial.\n And there wasn\u0027t really a thing that Jez could say to the humans she lived with. She certainly couldn\u0027t give\n them any excuse that would make sense.\n \"First, ditching Claire even though you swore to us that you\u0027d let her drive you to school.\" Aunt Nanami\n was ticking items off on her fingers. \"Second, ditching school after you swore to us you weren\u0027t going to\n skip again. Third, going off some place you won\u0027t even tell us about. Fourth, not even calling to let us\n know you were still alive. Fifth, getting home at almost ten o\u0027clock at night-\"\n Uncle Jim cleared his throat. \"Nan, I think we\u0027ve been over this already.\"\n A couple of times, Jez thought. Oh, well, at least Claire is enjoying it. Her cousin was standing at the\n entrance to the living room, openly listening. When she happened to catch Jez\u0027s eye she smiled brilliantly,\n her small face actually glowing with smug satisfaction.\n Aunt Nan was shaking her head. \u0027I just want to make sure she understands, Jim. I thought she\n understood last night, but obviously...\" She threw her hands up.\n \"Well, the thing is-\" Uncle Jim cleared his throat again and looked at Jez. He looked uncomfortable; he\n wasn\u0027t very good at discipline, but Jez\n could see that he\u0027d reached his limit. \"The thing is that we can\u0027t just keep yelling at you. We have to do\n something, Jez. So we\u0027ve decided to lock up your motorcycle. You can\u0027t ride it anymore, not until you\n learn to be more responsible.\"\n Jez sat stunned.\n Not her bike. They couldn\u0027t take her bike from her.\n How would she get anywhere?\n She had to be mobile. She had to get to Morgead tomorrow-she had to get to Hugh sometime. She had\n to be able to track down the Wild Power. And she couldn\u0027t do any of that without transportation.\n But she could see from Uncle Jim\u0027s face that he was serious. He\u0027d finally decided to put his foot down,\n and Jez had gotten caught underneath it.\n She let out her breath. Part of her wanted to yell and storm and rage about this, to lose control and\n make a big noisy fuss.\n But it wouldn\u0027t do any good. Besides, she\u0027d managed to keep her temper for almost a year with these\n people, to live her double life as a student and vampire hunter and make it all work. To blow that now\n would be stupid.\n And another part of her was scared that she was even verging on losing control. That was what even a\n day with Morgead did to her. It cut through all her careful discipline and changed her back into a raving\n barbarian.\n Morgead... she couldn\u0027t think about him now.\n \"Okay, Uncle Jim,\" she said out loud. \"I understand. You do what you have to.\"\n \"If you can just show us that you\u0027re learning to be responsible, then you can have the bike back. You\n have to learn to take life more seriously, Jez.\"\n That forced a tired snort out of her. She was laughing before she knew it, and her aunt and uncle were\n looking shocked and displeased.\n I\u0027m sorry,\" she said. \u0027I\u0027ll try harder.\"\n And I\u0027ll just have to take public transportation tomorrow, she thought when the lecture was over and she\n was free to go to her room. Even though that\u0027s a lot more dangerous. I could get hunted down so easily. .\n \"You messed with the wrong person, you know?\" Claire said as Jez reached her door. \"You shouldn\u0027t\n have dumped me like that. You shouldn\u0027t make me mad.\"\n \"Yeah, Claire; well, now I know better. I\u0027m terrified.\"\n \"You\u0027re still not taking things seriously, are you?\"\n \"Claire-\" Jez rounded on the smaller girl. Then she stopped dead. \"I don\u0027t have time for this,\" she\n muttered. \"I have to make a call. You just run along and harass somebody else.\"\n She shut the bedroom door in Claire\u0027s face.\n Which, she realized later, was a mistake. At the time, though, she was too tired to think about it.\n She was too tired to think properly at all. Tired and distraught, with the feeling that everything was\n closing in and happening too fast.\n And so when she picked up the phone to dial Hugh she hardly noticed the little click on the line, and she\n didn\u0027t stop for even a second to consider what it meant. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-huntress-night-world-7/page-13.html","bookId":1863,"book":{"id":1863,"title":"Night World : Huntress (Night World #7)","description":"Storyline: \n Huntress (Night World Book 7) \n Jez Redfern is unique.
