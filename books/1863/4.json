Always wash the blood off before coming in the house.\n Jez stood at the outdoor faucet, icy-cold water splashing over her hands. She was scrubbing- carefully-a\n long, slim dagger made of split bamboo, with a cutting edge as sharp as glass. When it was clean, she\n slipped it into her right knee-high boot. Then she daubed water over several stains on her T-shirt and\n jeans and scrubbed them with a fingernail. Finally she whipped out a pocket mirror and examined her\n face critically.\n The girl who looked back didn\u0027t much resemble the wild, laughing huntress who had leaped from tree to\n tree in Muir Woods. Oh, the features were the same; the height of cheekbone, the curve of chin. They\n had even fined out a bit because she was a year older. The red flag of hair was the same, too, although\n now it was pulled back in an attempt to tame its fiery disorder. The difference was in the expression,\n which was sadder and wiser than Jez had ever imagined she could be, and in the eyes.\n The eyes weren\u0027t as silvery as they had been, not as dangerously beautiful. But that was only to be\n expected. She had discovered that she didn\u0027t need to drink blood as long as she didn\u0027t use her vampire\n powers. Human food kept her alive-and made her look more human.\n One other thing about the eyes. They were scarily vulnerable, even to Jez. No matter how she tried to\n make them hard and menacing, they had the wounded look of a deer that knows it\u0027s going to die and\n accepts it. Sometimes she wondered if that was an omen.\n Well. No blood on her face. She shoved the mirror back in her pocket. She was mostly presentable, if\n extremely late for dinner. She turned the faucet off and headed for the back door of the low, sweeping\n ranch house.\n Everyone looked up as she came in.\n The family was in the kitchen, eating at the oak table with the white trim, under the bright fluorescent\n light. The TV was blaring cheerfully from the family room. Uncle Jim, her mother\u0027s brother, was munching\n tacos and leafing through the mail. He had red hair darker than Jez\u0027s and a long face that looked almost\n as medieval as Jez\u0027s mother\u0027s had. He was usually off in a gentle, worried dream somewhere. Now he\n waved an envelope at Jez and\n gazed at her reproachfully, but he couldn\u0027t say anything because his mouth was full.\n Aunt Nanami was on the phone, drinking a diet Coke. She was small, with dark shiny hair and eyes that\n turned to crescents when she smiled. She opened her mouth and frowned at Jez, but couldn\u0027t say\n anything, either.\n Ricky, who was ten, had carroty hair and expressive eyebrows. He gave Jez a big smile that showed\n chewed-up taco in his mouth and said, \"Hi!\"\n Jez smiled back. No matter what she did, Ricky was there for her.\n Claire, who was Jez\u0027s age, was sitting primly, eating bits of taco with her fork. She looked like a smaller\n version of Aunt Nan, but with a very sour expression.\n \"Where have you been?\" she said. \"We waited dinner almost an hour for you and you never even\n called.\"\n \"Sorry,\" Jez said, looking at all of them. It was such an incredibly normal family scene, so completely\n typical, and it struck her to the heart.\n It was over a year since she had walked out of the Night World to find these people, her mother\u0027s\n relatives. It was eleven and a half months since Uncle Jim had taken her in, not knowing anything about\n her except that she was his orphaned niece and that her father\u0027s family couldn\u0027t handle her anymore and\n had given up on her. All these months, she had lived with the Goddard family- and she still didn\u0027t fit in.\n She could look human, she could act human, but she couldn\u0027t be human.\n Just as Uncle Jim swallowed and got his mouth clear to speak to her, she said, \"I\u0027m not hungry. I think\n I\u0027ll just go do my homework.\"\n Uncle Jim called, \"Wait a minute,\" after her, but it was Claire who slammed down her napkin and\n actually followed Jez through the hall to the other side of the house.\n \"What do you mean, \u0027Sorry\u0027? You do this every day. You\u0027re always disappearing; half the time you stay\n out until after midnight, and then you don\u0027t even have an explanation.\"\n \"Yeah, I know, Claire.\" Jez answered without looking back. \"Illtry to do better.\"\n \"You say that every time. And every time it\u0027s exactly the same. Don\u0027t you realize that my parents worry\n about you? Don\u0027t you even care?\"\n \"Yes, I care, Claire.\"\n \"You don\u0027t act like it. You act like rules don\u0027t apply to you. And you say sorry, but you\u0027re just going to\n do it again.\"\n Jez had to keep herself from turning around and snapping at her cousin. She liked everyone else in the\n family, but Claire was a royal pain.\n Worse, she was a shrewd royal pain. And she was right; Jez was going to do it again, and there was no\n way she could explain.\n The thing was, vampire hunters have to keep weird hours.\n When you\u0027re on the trail of a vampire-and-shapeshifter killing team, as Jez had been this evening, chasing\n them through the slums ofOakland , trying to get them cornered in some crack house\n where there aren\u0027t little kids to get hurt, you don\u0027t think about missing dinner. You don\u0027t stop in the\n middle of staking the undead to phone home.\n Maybe I shouldn\u0027t have become a vampire hunter, Jez thought. But it\u0027s a little late to change now, and\n somebody\u0027s got to protect these stupid- these innocent humans from the Night World.\n Oh, well.\n She\u0027d reached the door of her bedroom. Instead of yelling at her cousin, she simply half turned and said,\n \"Why don\u0027t you go work on your Web page, Claire?\" Then she opened the door and glanced inside.\n And froze.\n Her room, which she had left in military neatness, was a shambles. The window was wide open. Papers\n and clothes were scattered across the floor. And there was a very large ghoul standing at the foot of the\n The ghoul opened its mouth menacingly at Jez.\n \"Oh, very funny,\" Claire was saying, right behind her. \"Maybe I should help you with your homework. I\n hear you\u0027re not doing so great in chemistry-\"\n Jez moved fast, stepping nimbly inside the door and slamming it in Claire\u0027s face, pressing the little knob in\n the handle to lock it.\n \"Hey!\" Now Claire sounded really mad. \"That\u0027s rude!\"\n \"Uh, sorry, Claire!\" Jez faced the ghoul. What was it doing here? If it had followed her home, she was in\n bad trouble. That meant the Night World\n knew where she was. \"You know, Claire, I think I really need to be alone for a little while-I can\u0027t talk\n and do my homework.\" She took a step toward the creature, watching its reaction.\n Ghouls were semi-vampires. They were what happened to a human who was bled out but didn\u0027t get\n quite enough vampire blood in exchange to become a true vampire. They were undead but rotting. They\n had very little mind, and only one idea in the world: to drink blood, which they usually did by eating as\n much of a human body as possible. They liked hearts.\n This ghoul was a new one, about two weeks dead. It was male and looked as if it had been a\n body-builder, although by now it wasn\u0027t so much buff as puffed. Its body was swollen with the gas of\n decomposition. Its tongue and eyes were protruding, its cheeks were chipmunk-like, and bloody fluid\n was leaking from its nose.\n And of course it didn\u0027t smell good.\n As Jez edged closer, she suddenly realized that the ghoul wasn\u0027t alone. She could now see around the\n foot of the bed, and there was a boy lying on the carpet, apparently unconscious. The boy had light hair\n and rumpled clothes, but Jez couldn\u0027t see his face. The ghoul was stooping over him, reaching for him\n with sausage-shaped fingers.\n \"I don\u0027t think so,\" Jez told it softly. She could feel a dangerous smile settling on her face. She reached\n into her right boot and pulled out the dagger.\n \"What did you say?\" Claire shouted from the other side of the door.\n \"Nothing, Claire. Just getting out my homework.\" Jez jumped onto the bed The ghoul was very big-she\n needed all the height she could get.\n The ghoul turned to face her, its lackluster bugeyes on the dagger. It made a little hissing sound around\n its swollen tongue. Fortunately that was all the noise it could make.\n Claire was rattling the door. \"Did you lock this? What are you doing in there?\"\n \"Just studying, Claire. Go away.\" Jez snapped a foot toward the ghoul, catching it under the chin. She\n needed to stun it and stake it fast Ghouls weren\u0027t smart, but like the Energizer Bunny they kept going and\n going. This one could eat the entire Goddard family tonight and still be hungry at dawn.\n The ghoul hit the wall opposite the bed. Jez jumped down, putting herself between it and the boy on the\n floor.\n \"What was that noise?\" Claire yelled. \"I dropped a book.\"\n The ghoul swung. Jez ducked. There were giant blisters on its arms, the brownish color of old blood.\n It rushed her, trying to slam her against the chest of drawers. Jez flung herself backward, but she didn\u0027t\n have much room to maneuver. It caught her in the stomach with an elbow, a jarring blow.\n Jez wouldn\u0027t let herself double over. She twisted and helped the ghoul in the direction it was already\n going, giving it impetus with her foot. It smacked into the window seat, facedown.\n \"What is going on in there?\"\n \"Just looking for something.\" Jez moved before the ghoul could recover, jumping to straddle its legs. She\n grabbed its hair-not a good idea; it came off in clumps in her hand. Kneeling on it to keep it still, she\n raised the sum bamboo knife high and brought it down hard.\n There was a puncturing sound and a terrible smell. The knife had penetrated just under the shoulder\n blade, six inches into the heart.\n The ghoul convulsed once and stopped moving.\n Claire\u0027s voice came piercingly from behind the closed door. \"Mom! She\u0027s doing something in there!\"\n Then Aunt Nan\u0027s voice: \"Jez, are you all right?\"\n Jez stood, pulling her bamboo dagger out, wiping it on the ghoul\u0027s shirt. \"I\u0027m just having a little trouble\n finding a ruler....\" The ghoul was in a perfect position. She put her arms around its waist, ignoring the\n feeling of skin slipping loose under her fingers, and heaved it up onto the window seat. There weren\u0027t\n many human girls who could have picked up almost two hundred pounds of dead weight, and even Jez\n ended up a little breathless. She gave the ghoul a shove, rolling it over until it reached the open window,\n then she stuffed and maneuvered it out. It fell heavily into a bed of impatiens, squashing the flowers.\n Good. She\u0027d haul it away later tonight and dispose of it.\n Jez caught her breath, brushed off her hands, and closed the window. She drew the curtains shut, then\n turned. The fair-haired boy was lying perfectly still. Jez touched his back gently, saw that he was\n breathing.\n The door rattled and Claire\u0027s voice rose hysterically. \"Mom, do you smell that smell?\"\n Aunt Nan called, \"Jez!\"\n \"Coming!\" Jez glanced around the room. She needed something... there. The bed.\n Grabbing a handful of material near the head of the bed, she flipped comforter, blankets and sheets over\n so they trailed off the foot, completely covering the boy. She tossed a couple of pillows on top of the pile\n for good measure, then grabbed a ruler off the desk. Then she opened the door, leaned against the\n doorframe casually, and summoned her brightest smile.\n \"Sorry about that,\" she said. \"What can I do for you?\"\n Claire and Aunt Nan just stared at her.\n Claire looked like a rumpled, angry kitten. The fine dark hair that framed her face was ruffled; she was\n breathing hard, and her almond-shaped eyes were flashing sparks. Aunt Nan looked more worried and\n dismayed.\n \"Are you okay?\" she said, leaning in slightly to try and get a look at Jez\u0027s room. \"We heard a lot of\n noise.\"\n And you\u0027d have heard more earlier if you hadn\u0027t been watching TV. \"I\u0027m fine. I\u0027m great. You know how\n it is when you can\u0027t find something.\" Jez lifted\n the ruler. Then she stepped back and opened the door farther.\n Aunt Nan\u0027s eyes widened as she took in the mess. \"Jez... this does not happen when you can\u0027t find a\n ruler. This looks like Claire\u0027s room.\"\n Claire made a choked sound of indignation. \"It does not. My room\u0027s never been this bad. And what\u0027s\n that smell?\" She slipped by Aunt Nan and advanced on Jez, who sidestepped to keep her from getting to\n the pile of blankets.\n Claire stopped dead anyway, her face wrinkling. She put a hand to cover her nose and mouth. \"It\u0027s you,\"\n she said, pointing at Jez. \u0027You smell like that.\"\n \"Sorry.\" It was true; what with all the contact she\u0027d had with the ghoul, and the dirty knife in her boot,\n she was pretty ripe. \"I think I stepped in something on the way home.\"\n \"I didn\u0027t smell anything when you came in,\" Claire said suspiciously.\n \"And that\u0027s another thing,\" Aunt Nan said. She had been glancing around the room, but there was\n nothing suspicious to see except the unusual clutter-the curtains hung motionless over the shut window;\n the pile of bedding on the floor was still. Now she turned to face Jez again. \"You didn\u0027t call to say you\n were going to miss dinner again. I need to know where you go after school, Jez. I need to know when\n you\u0027re going to be out late. It\u0027s common courtesy.\"\n \"I know. I\u0027ll remember next time. I really will.\" Jez said it as sincerely as possible, and in a tone she\n hoped would close the subject. She needed to get rid of these people and look at the boy under the\n blankets. He might be seriously hurt.\n Aunt Nan was nodding. \"You\u0027d better. And you\u0027d better take a shower before you do anything else.\n Throw your clothes in the laundry room; I\u0027ll put them in the wash.\" She made as if to kiss Jez on the\n cheek, but stopped, wrinkled her nose, and then just nodded again at her.\n \"And that\u0027s it? That\u0027s all?\" Claire was looking at her mother in disbelief. \"Mom, she\u0027s up to something,\n can\u0027t you see that? She comes in late, smelling like dead skunk and sewage and I don\u0027t know what, and\n then she locks herself in and bangs around and lies, and all you\u0027re going to say is Don\u0027t do it again\u0027? She\n gets away with everything around here-\"\n \"Claire, quit it. She said she was sorry. I\u0027m sure she won\u0027t let it happen again.\"\n \"If I did something like that you\u0027d skin me, but, no, if Jez does it, it must be okay. Well, I\u0027ll tell you\n something else. She cut school today. She left before sixth period.\"\n \"Is that true, Jez?\" a new voice asked. Uncle Jim was standing in the doorway, pulling at his chin with\n long fingers. He looked sad.\n It was true. Jez had left early to set up a trap for the vampire and shapeshifter. She looked at her uncle\n and made a regretful motion with her head and shoulders.\n \"Jez, you just can\u0027t do that. I\u0027m trying to be reasonable, but this is only the second week of school.\n You can\u0027t start this kind of behavior again. It can\u0027t be like last year.\" He thought. \"From now on, you\n leave your motorcycle at home. You drive to school and back with Claire, in the Audi.\"\n Jez nodded. \"Okay, Uncle Jim,\" she said out loud. Now go away, she added silently. Thin curls of\n anxiety were churning in her stomach.\n \"Thank you.\" He smiled at her.\n \"See?\" Claire jumped in, her voice hitting a note to shatter glass. \"This is just what I\u0027m talking about! You\n never yell at her, either! Is it because you\u0027re afraid she\u0027ll run away, like she did from her dad\u0027s relatives?\n So everybody has to walk on eggshells around her because otherwise she\u0027ll just take off-\"\n \"Okay, that\u0027s it. I\u0027m not listening to any more of this.\" Aunt Nan waved a hand at Claire, then turned\n around to shoo Uncle Jim out of her path. Tm going to clean up the dinner table. If you two want to fight,\n do it quietly.\"\n \"No, it\u0027s better if they do their homework,\" Uncle Jim said, moving slowly. \"Both of you, do your\n homework, okay?\" He looked at Jez in a way that was probably meant to be commanding, but came out\n wistful. \"And tomorrow come home on time.\"\n Jez nodded. Then both adults were gone, but Claire was staring after them. Jez couldn\u0027t be sure, but she\n thought there were tears in her eyes.\n Jez felt a pang. Of course, Claire was dead on about the leeway Aunt Nan and Uncle Jim gave her. And\n of course, it wasn\u0027t fair to Claire.\n I should say something to her. Poor little thing. She really feels bad....\n But before she could open her mouth, Claire whirled around. The eyes that had been wet a moment ago\n were flashing.\n \"You just wait,\" she said. \"They don\u0027t see through you, but I do. You\u0027re up to something, and I\u0027m going\n to find out what it is. And don\u0027t think I can\u0027t do it.\"\n She turned and stalked out the door.\n Jez stood for an instant, speechless, then she blinked and closed the door. She locked it. And then for\n the first time since she\u0027d seen the ghoul, she allowed herself to let out a long breath.\n That had been close. And Claire was serious, which was going to be a problem. But Jez didn\u0027t have time\n to think about it now.\n She turned the clock radio on her nightstand to a rock station. A loud one. Then she flipped the covers\n off the foot of the bed and knelt.\n The boy was lying facedown, with one arm stretched over his head. Jez couldn\u0027t see any blood. She\n took his shoulder and carefully rolled him over.\n And stopped breathing.\n \"Hugh.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-huntress-night-world-7/page-4.html","bookId":1863,"book":{"id":1863,"title":"Night World : Huntress (Night World #7)","description":"Storyline: \n Huntress (Night World Book 7) \n Jez Redfern is unique.
