{"id":7989,"no":2,"title":"CHAPTER II. THE EVENTS OF AN EVENING.","content":"AT this moment the outer door opened, and Timothy Crump entered, not with the quick elastic step of one who brings good tidings, but slowly and deliberately, with a quiet gravity of demeanor, in which his wife could read only too well that he had failed in his efforts to procure work. His wife, reading all these things in his manner, had the delicacy to forbear intruding upon him questions to which she saw that he could give no satisfactory answers. Not so Aunt Rachel. “I needn\u0027t ask,” she began, “whether you got work, Timothy. I knew beforehand you wouldn\u0027t. There ain\u0027t no use in tryin\u0027. The times is awful dull, and, mark my words, they\u0027ll be wuss before they\u0027re better. We mayn\u0027t live to see \u0027em. I don\u0027t expect we shall. Folks can\u0027t live without money, and when that\u0027s gone we shall have to starve.” “Not so bad as that, Rachel,” said the cooper, trying to look cheerful; “don\u0027t talk about starving till the time comes. Anyhow,” glancing at the table on which was spread a good plain meal, “we needn\u0027t talk about starving till to-morrow, with that before us. Where\u0027s Jack?” “Gone after some flour,” replied his wife. “On credit?” asked the cooper. “No, he\u0027s got the money to pay for a few pounds,” said Mrs. Crump, smiling, with an air of mystery. “Where did it come from?” asked Timothy, who was puzzled, as his wife anticipated. “I didn\u0027t know you had any money in the house.” “No more we had, but he earned it himself, holding horses, this afternoon.” “Come, that\u0027s good,” said the cooper, cheerfully, “We ain\u0027t so bad off as we might be, you see, Rachel.” The latter shook her head with the air of a martyr. At this moment Jack returned, and the family sat down to supper. “You haven\u0027t told us,” said Mrs. Crump, seeing her husband\u0027s cheerfulness in a measure restored, “what Mr. Blodgett said about the chances for employment.” “Not much that was encouraging,” answered Timothy. “He isn\u0027t at all sure how soon it will be best to commence work; perhaps not before spring.” “Didn\u0027t I tell you so?” commented Rachel, with sepulchral sadness. Even Mr. Crump could not help looking sober. “I suppose, Timothy, you haven\u0027t formed any plans,” she said. “No, I haven\u0027t had time. I must try to get something else to do.” “What, for instance?” “Anything by which I can earn a little, I don\u0027t care if it\u0027s only sawing wood. We shall have to get along as economically as we can; cut our coat according to our cloth.” “Oh, you\u0027ll be able to earn something, and we can live very plain,” said Mrs. Crump, affecting a cheerfulness greater than she felt. “Pity you hadn\u0027t done it sooner,” was the comforting suggestion of Rachel. “Mustn\u0027t cry over spilt milk,” said the cooper, good-humoredly. “Perhaps we might have lived a leetle more economically, but I don\u0027t think we\u0027ve been extravagant.” “Besides, I can earn something, father,” said Jack, hopefully. “You know I did this afternoon.” “So you can,” said Mrs. Crump, brightly. “There ain\u0027t horses to hold every day,” said Rachel, apparently fearing that the family might become too cheerful, when, like herself, it was their duty to become profoundly gloomy. “You\u0027re always trying\u0027 to discourage people,” said Jack, discontentedly. Rachel took instant umbrage at these words. “I\u0027m sure,” said she; mournfully, “I don\u0027t want to make you unhappy. If you can find anything to be cheerful about when you\u0027re on the verge of starvation, I hope you\u0027ll enjoy yourselves, and not mind me. I\u0027m a poor dependent creetur, and I feel to know I\u0027m a burden.” “Now, Rachel, that\u0027s all foolishness,” said Uncle Tim. “You don\u0027t feel anything of the kind.” “Perhaps others can tell how I feel, better than I can myself,” answered his sister, knitting rapidly. “If it hadn\u0027t been for me, I know you\u0027d have been able to lay up money, and have something to carry you through the winter. It\u0027s hard to be a burden upon your relations, and bring a brother\u0027s family to poverty.” “Don\u0027t talk of being a burden, Rachel,” said Mrs. Crump. “You\u0027ve been a great help to me in many ways. That pair of stockings now you\u0027re knitting for Jack—that\u0027s a help, for I couldn\u0027t have got time for them myself.” “I don\u0027t expect,” said Aunt Rachel, in the same sunny manner, “that I shall be able to do it long. From the pains I have in my hands sometimes, I expect I\u0027m going to lose the use of \u0027em soon, and be as useless as old Mrs. Sprague, who for the last ten years of her life had to sit with her hands folded in her lap. But I wouldn\u0027t stay to be a burden. I\u0027d go to the poor-house first, but perhaps,” with the look of a martyr, “they wouldn\u0027t want me there, because I should be discouragin\u0027 \u0027em too much.” Poor Jack, who had so unwittingly raised this storm, winced under the words, which he knew were directed at him. “Then why,” said he, half in extenuation, “why don\u0027t you try to look pleasant and cheerful? Why won\u0027t you be jolly, as Tom Piper\u0027s aunt is?” “I dare say I ain\u0027t pleasant,” said Aunt Rachel, “as my own nephew tells me so. There is some folks that can be cheerful when their house is a burnin\u0027 down before their eyes, and I\u0027ve heard of one young man that laughed at his aunt\u0027s funeral,” directing a severe glance at Jack; “but I\u0027m not one of that kind. I think, with the Scriptures, that there\u0027s a time to weep.” “Doesn\u0027t it say there\u0027s a time to laugh, also?” asked Mrs. Crump. “When I see anything to laugh about, I\u0027m ready to laugh,” said Aunt Rachel; “but human nature ain\u0027t to be forced. I can\u0027t see anything to laugh at now, and perhaps you won\u0027t by and by.” It was evidently of no use to attempt a confutation of this, and the subject dropped. The tea-things were cleared away by Mrs. Crump, who afterwards sat down to her sewing. Aunt Rachel continued to knit in grim silence, while Jack seated himself on a three-legged stool near his aunt, and began to whittle out a boat after a model lent him by Tom Piper, a young gentleman whose aunt has already been referred to. The cooper took out his spectacles, wiped them carefully with his handkerchief, and as carefully adjusted them to his nose. He then took down from the mantel-piece one of the few books belonging to his library,—“Captain Cook\u0027s Travels,”—and began to read, for the tenth time it might be, the record of the gallant sailor\u0027s circumnavigations. The plain little room presented a picture of peaceful tranquillity, but it proved to be only the calm which precedes a storm. The storm in question, I regret to say, was brought about by the luckless Jack. As has been said, he was engaged in constructing a boat, the particular operation he was now intent upon being the excavation or hollowing out. Now three-legged stools are not the most secure seats in the world. That, I think, no one can doubt who has any practical acquaintance with them. Jack was working quite vigorously, the block from which the boat was to be fashioned being held firmly between his knees. His knife having got wedged in the wood, he made an unusual effort to draw it out, in which he lost his balance, and disturbed the equilibrium of his stool, which, with his load, tumbled over backwards. Now it very unfortunately happened that Aunt Rachel sat close behind, and the treacherous stool came down with considerable force upon her foot. A piercing shriek was heard, and Aunt Rachel, lifting her foot, clung to it convulsively, while an expression of pain distorted her features. At the sound, the cooper hastily removed his spectacles, and letting “Captain Cook” fall to the floor, started up in great dismay—Mrs. Crump likewise dropped her sewing, and jumped to her feet in alarm. It did not take long to see how matters stood. “Hurt ye much, Rachel?” inquired Timothy. “It\u0027s about killed me,” groaned the afflicted maiden. “Oh, I shall have to have my foot cut off, or be a cripple anyway.” Then turning upon Jack, fiercely, “you careless, wicked, ungrateful boy, that I\u0027ve been wearin\u0027 myself out knittin\u0027 for. I\u0027m almost sure you did it a purpose. You won\u0027t be satisfied till you\u0027ve got me out of the world, and then—then, perhaps——” here Rachel began to whimper, “perhaps you\u0027ll get Tom Piper\u0027s aunt to knit your stockings.” “I didn\u0027t mean to, Aunt Rachel,” said Jack, penitently, eyeing his aunt, who was rocking to and fro in her chair. “Besides, I hurt myself like thunder,” rubbing vigorously the lower part of the dorsal-region. “Served you right,” said his aunt, still clasping her foot. “Sha\u0027n\u0027t I get something for you to put on it?” asked Mrs. Crump of (sic) her-sister-in-law. This Rachel steadily refused, and after a few more postures, (sic) indicating a great amount of anguish, limped out of the room, and ascended the stairs to her own apartment. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3017/83398.html","bookId":264,"book":{"id":264,"title":"Timothy Crump\u0027s Ward A Story of American Life","description":"简介： IT was drawing towards the close of the last day of the year.
