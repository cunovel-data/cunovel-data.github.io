{"id":7988,"no":1,"title":"CHAPTER I. INTRODUCES THE CRUMPS.","content":"IT was drawing towards the close of the last day of the year. A few hours more, and 1836 would be no more. It was a cold day. There was no snow on the ground, but it was frozen into stiff ridges, making it uncomfortable to walk upon. The sun had been out all day, but there was little heat or comfort in its bright, but frosty beams. The winter is a hard season for the poor. It multiplies their necessities, while, in general, it limits their means and opportunities of earning. The winter of 1836-37 was far from being an exception to this rule. It was worse than usual, on account of the general stagnation of business. In an humble tenement, located on what was then the outskirts of New York, though to-day a granite warehouse stands on the spot, lived Timothy Crump, an industrious cooper. His family consisted of a wife and one child, a boy of twelve, whose baptismal name was John, though invariably addressed, by his companions, as Jack. There was another member of the household who would be highly offended if she were not introduced, in due form, to the reader. This was Miss Rachel Crump, maiden sister of Uncle Tim, as he was usually designated. Miss Rachel was not much like her brother, for while the latter was a good-hearted, cheerful easy man, who was inclined to view the world in its sunniest aspect, Rachel was cynical, and given to misanthropy. Poor Rachel, let us not be too hard upon thy infirmities. Could we lift the veil that hides the secrets of that virgin heart, it might be, perchance, that we should find a hidden cause, far back in the days when thy cheeks were rounder and thine eyes brighter, and thine aspect not quite so frosty. Ah, faithless Harry Fletcher! thou hadst some hand in that peevishness and repining which make Rachel Crump, and all about her, uncomfortable. Lured away by a prettier face, you left her to pass through life, unblessed by that love which every female heart craves, and for which no kindred love will compensate. It was your faithlessness that left her to walk, with repining spirit, the flinty path of the old maid. Yes; it must be said—Rachel Crump was an old maid; not from choice, but hard necessity. And so, one by one, she closed up the avenues of her heart, and clothed herself with complaining, as with a garment. Being unblessed with earthly means, she had accepted the hearty invitation of her brother, and become an inmate of his family, where she paid her board by little services about the house, and obtained sufficient needle-work to replenish her wardrobe as often as there was occasion. Forty-five years had now rolled over her head, leaving clearer traces of their presence, doubtless, than if her spirit had been more cheerful; so that Rachel, whose strongly marked features never could have been handsome, was now undeniably homely. Mrs. Crump, fortunately for her husband\u0027s peace, did not in the least resemble her sister-in-law. Her disposition was cheerful, and she had frequent occasion to remonstrate with her upon the dark view she took of life. Had her temper been different, it is very easy to see that she would have been continually quarrelling with Rachel; but, happily, she was one of those women with whom it is impossible to quarrel. With her broad mantle of charity, she was always seeking to cover up and extenuate the defects of her sister-in-law, though she could not help acknowledging their existence. It had been a hard winter for the cooper. For a month he had been unable to obtain work of any kind, and for the two months previous he had worked scarcely more than half the time. Unfortunately for him, his expenses for a few years back had kept such even pace with his income, that he had no reserved fund to fall back upon in such a time as this. That was no fault of his. Both he and his wife had been economical enough, but there are a great many things included in family expenses—rent, fuel, provisions, food, clothing, and a long list of sundries, besides; and all these had cost money, of which desirable article Uncle Tim\u0027s trade furnished not a very large supply. So it happened that, as tradesmen were slow to trust, they had been obliged to part with a sofa to defray the expenses of the month of December. This article was selected because it was best convertible into cash,—being wanted by a neighbor,—besides being about the only article of luxury, if it could be called such, in possession of the family. As such it had been hardly used, being reserved for state occasions; yet hardly had it left (sic) the the house, when Aunt Rachel began to show signs of extreme lowness of spirits, and bewailed its loss as a privation of a personal comfort. “Life\u0027s full of disappointments,” she groaned. “Our paths is continually beset by \u0027em. There\u0027s that sofa! It\u0027s so pleasant to have one in the house when a body\u0027s sick. But there, it\u0027s gone, and if I happen to get down, as most likely I shall, for I\u0027ve got a bad feeling in my stummick this very minute, I shall have to go up-stairs, and most likely catch my death of cold, and that will be the end of me.” “Not so bad as that, I hope,” said Mrs. Crump, cheerfully. “You know, when you was sick last, you didn\u0027t want to use the sofa—you said it didn\u0027t lay comfortable. Besides, I hope, before you are sick again we may be able to buy it back again.” Aunt Rachel shook her head despondingly. “There ain\u0027t any use in hoping that,” said she. “Timothy\u0027s got so much behindhand that he won\u0027t be able to get up again; I know he won\u0027t.” “But if he manages to get steady work soon, he will.” “No, he won\u0027t. I\u0027m sure he won\u0027t. There won\u0027t be any work before spring, and most likely not then.” “You are too desponding, Aunt Rachel.” “Enough to make me so. If you had only taken my advice, we shouldn\u0027t have come to this.” “I don\u0027t know what advice you refer to, Rachel.” “No, I don\u0027t expect you do. You didn\u0027t pay no attention to it. That\u0027s the reason.” “But if you\u0027ll repeat it, perhaps we can profit by it yet,” said Mrs. Crump, with imperturbable good humor. “I told you you ought to be layin\u0027 up something ag\u0027in a rainy day. But that\u0027s always the way. Folks think when times is good it\u0027s always a goin\u0027 to be so, but I knew better.” “I don\u0027t see how we could have been more economical,” said Mrs. Crump, mildly. “There\u0027s a hundred ways. Poor folks like us ought not to expect to have meat so often. It\u0027s frightful to think what the butcher\u0027s bill must have been the last six months.” Inconsistent Rachel! Only the day before she had made herself very uncomfortable because there was no meat for dinner, and said she couldn\u0027t live without it. Mrs. Crump might have reminded her of this, but the good woman was too kind to make the retort. She contented herself with saying that they must try to do better in future. “That\u0027s always the way,” muttered Rachel. “Shut the stable door when the horse is stolen. Folks never learn from experience till it\u0027s too late to be of any use. I don\u0027t see what the world was made for, for my part. Everything goes topsy-turvy, and all sorts of ways except the right way. I sometimes think \u0027taint much use livin\u0027.” “Oh, you\u0027ll feel better by and by, Rachel. Hark, there\u0027s Jack, isn\u0027t it?” “Anybody might know by the noise who it is,” pursued Rachel, in the same general tone that had marked her conversation hitherto. “He always comes stomping along as if he was paid for makin\u0027 a noise. Anybody ought to have a cast-iron head that lives anywhere in his hearing.” Her cheerful remarks were here broken in upon by the sudden entrance of Jack, who, in his eagerness, slammed the door behind him, unheeding his mother\u0027s quiet admonition not to make a noise. “Look there!” said he, displaying a quarter of a dollar. “How did you get it?” asked his mother. “Holding horses,” answered Jack. “Here, take it, mother. I warrant you\u0027ll find a use for it.” “It comes in good time,” said Mrs. Crump. “We\u0027re out of flour, and I had no money to buy any. Before you take off your boots, Jack, why can\u0027t you run over to the store, and get half a dozen pounds?” “You see the Lord hasn\u0027t quite forgotten us,” remarked his mother, as Jack started on his errand. “What\u0027s a quarter of a dollar?” said Rachel, gloomily. “Will it carry us through the winter?” “It will carry us through to-night, and perhaps Timothy will have work to-morrow. Hark, that\u0027s his step.” \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3017/83397.html","bookId":264,"book":{"id":264,"title":"Timothy Crump\u0027s Ward A Story of American Life","description":"简介： IT was drawing towards the close of the last day of the year.
