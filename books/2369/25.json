{"id":69496,"no":25,"title":"Page 25","content":"DANA\u0027S CELL PHONE RANG.\n \"Jeff!\"\n \"Hello, darling.\" And the sound of his voice was a blanket wrapped around her, warming her.\n \"Oh, Jeff!\" She found that she was trembling.\n \"How are you?\"\n How am I? I\u0027m running for my life. But she could not tell him that. There was no way he could help her, not now. It was too late. \"I\u0027m - I\u0027m fine, darling.\"\n \"Where are you now, world traveler?\"\n \"I\u0027m in Chicago. I\u0027ll be back in Washington tomorrow.\"When are you going to be with me? \"How - how is Rachel?\"\n \"She seems to be doing okay.\"\n \"I miss you.\"\n Rachel\u0027s bedroom door opened, and she stepped into the living room. She started to call Jeff\u0027s name and stopped when she saw that he was on the phone.\n \"I miss you more than you can ever imagine,\" Jeff said.\n \"Oh, I love you so much.\" A man nearby seemed to be staring at her. Dana\u0027s heart began pounding. \"Darling, if - if anything happens to me...always remember that I - \"\n Jeff was instantly alarmed. \"What do you mean if anything happens to you?\"\n \"Nothing. I - I can\u0027t go into it now, but - I\u0027m sure everything will be fine.\"\n \"Dana, you can\u0027t let anything happen to you! I need you. I love you more than anyone I\u0027ve ever loved in my life. I couldn\u0027t bear to lose you.\"\n Rachel listened a moment longer, then quietly went back into her bedroom and closed the door.\n Dana and Jeff spoke for ten minutes more. When Dana finally hung up, she felt better. I\u0027m glad I had a chance to say good-bye. She looked up and saw the man still staring at her. There\u0027s no way one of Jack Stone\u0027s men could have arrived so quickly. I need to get out of here. She felt a rising panic.\n Dana\u0027s next-door neighbor knocked on Dana\u0027s door. Mrs. Daley opened it.\n \"Hello.\"\n \"Keep Kemal home. We\u0027re going to need him.\"\n \"I\u0027ll take care of it.\" Mrs. Daley closed the door and called to Kemal. \"Your oatmeal is almost ready, darling.\"\n Mrs. Daley went into the kitchen, took the oatmeal off the stove, and opened a bottom cabinet drawer filled with packets of drugs labeledBuSpar. Dozens of empty packets were at the bottom of the drawer. Mrs. Daley opened two new packets, hesitated, then added a third. She mixed the powder in with the oatmeal, poured sugar on top, and carried the cereal into the dining room. Kemal came in from the study.\n \"Here you are, love. Nice, hot oatmeal.\"\n \"I\u0027m not very hungry.\"\n \"You must eat, Kemal.\" Her voice was sharp in the way that frightened him. \"We don\u0027t want Miss Dana to be disappointed in us, do we?\"\n \"No.\"\n \"Good. I\u0027ll bet you can finish every bit of that for Miss Dana.\"\n Kemal sat down and began to eat.\n He should sleep for about six hours, Mrs. Daley calculated. Then I\u0027ll see what they want me to do with him.\n Dana raced through the airport until she passed a large dress shop.\n I need to hide my identity. She went inside and looked around. Everything seemed normal. Customers were busily buying merchandise and clerks were taking care of them. And then Dana looked out the shop door and she could feel her flesh crawl. Two menacing-looking men were standing there at each side of the entrance. One of them held a walkie-talkie.\n How had they found her in Chicago? Dana tried to control her panic. She turned to the clerk. \"Is there another way out of here?\"\n The clerk shook her head. \"I\u0027m sorry, miss. That\u0027s only for the staff.\"\n Dana\u0027s throat was dry. She looked out at the men again. I have to escape, Dana thought desperately. There has to be a way.\n Suddenly, she grabbed a dress off the rack and started to walk to the entrance.\n \"Wait a minute!\" the clerk called. \"You can\u0027t - \"\n Dana was approaching the door, and the two men started to move toward her. As Dana stepped through the door, the sensor on the dress tag triggered an alarm. A store guard came rushing out. The two men looked at each other and stepped back.\n \"Just a minute, miss,\" the guard said. \"You\u0027ll have to come back inside the store with me.\"\n \"Why should I?\" Dana protested.\n \"Why? Because shoplifting is against the law.\" The guard took Dana\u0027s arm and pulled her back inside. The men stood there, frustrated.\n Dana smiled at the guard. \"Okay. I admit it. I was shoplifting. Take me to jail.\"\n Shoppers began to stop to see what was happening. The manager came hurrying over. \"What\u0027s the problem here?\"\n \"I caught this woman trying to steal this dress.\"\n \"Well, I\u0027m afraid we\u0027ll have to call the pol - \" He turned and recognized Dana. \"My God! It\u0027s Dana Evans.\"\n Whispers rippled through the growing crowd.\n \"It\u0027s Dana Evans...\"\n \"We watch her on the news every night...\"\n \"Do you remember her broadcasts from the war...?\"\n The manager said, \"I\u0027m so sorry, Miss Evans. Obviously there\u0027s been a mistake.\"\n \"No, no,\" Dana said quickly. \"I was shoplifting.\" She held out her hands. \"You can arrest me.\"\n The manager smiled. \"I wouldn\u0027t dream of it. You can keep the dress, Miss Evans, with our compliments. We\u0027re flattered that you like it.\"\n Dana stared at him unbelievingly. \"You\u0027re not going to arrest me?\"\n His smile widened. \"I\u0027ll tell you what. I\u0027ll trade you the dress for an autograph. We\u0027re big fans of yours.\"\n One of the women gathered around exclaimed, \"Me, too!\"\n \"Can I have an autograph?\"\n More people were approaching.\n \"Look! It\u0027s Dana Evans.\"\n \"Can I have your autograph, Miss Evans?\"\n \"My husband and I watched you every night when you were in Sarajevo.\"\n \"You really made the war come alive.\"\n \"I\u0027d like an autograph, too.\"\n Dana stood there, growing more desperate by the second. She glanced outside. The two men were still there, waiting.\n Dana\u0027s mind was racing. She turned to the crowd and smiled. \"I\u0027ll tell you what I\u0027ll do. Let\u0027s go outside in the fresh air, and I\u0027ll give each of you an autograph.\"\n There were cries of excitement.\n Dana handed the dress to the manager. \"You can keep this. Thank you.\" She started toward the door, followed by her fans. The two men outside backed off, confused, as the crowd descended on them.\n Dana turned to her fans. \"Who\u0027s first?\" They were pressing around her, holding out pens and pieces of paper.\n The two men stood there, uneasy. As Dana signed autographs, she kept moving toward the terminal exit. The crowd followed her outside. A taxi pulled up at the curb, discharging a passenger.\n Dana turned to the crowd. \"Thank you. I have to go now.\" She jumped into the cab and a moment later it disappeared into the traffic.\n Jack Stone was on the phone with Roger Hudson. \"Mr. Hudson, she got away from us, but - \"\n \"Goddammit! I don\u0027t want to hear that. I want her taken out of the picture - now.\"\n \"Don\u0027t worry, sir. We\u0027ve got the license number of the taxi. She can\u0027t get far.\"\n \"Don\u0027t fail me again.\" Roger Hudson slammed the receiver down.\n Carson Pirie Scott \u0026 Company, in the heart of Chicago\u0027s Loop, was crowded with shoppers. At the scarf counter, a clerk was finishing wrapping a package for Dana.\n \"Will that be cash or charge?\"\n \"Cash.\"No sense leaving a paper trail.\n Dana took her package and had almost reached the exit when she suddenly stopped, filled with fear. Two different men were standing outside the door with walkie-talkies. Dana looked at them, her mouth suddenly dry. She turned and hurried back to the counter.\n The clerk asked, \"Was there something else, miss?\"\n \"No. I - \" Dana looked around in desperation. \"Is there another door leading out of here?\"\n \"Oh, yes, we have several entrances.\"\n It\u0027s no use, Dana thought. They\u0027ll have them all covered. This time there would be no escape.\n Dana noticed a woman shopper in a shabby old green coat looking at a scarf in a glass case. Dana studied her a moment, then walked over.\n \"Beautiful, aren\u0027t they?\" Dana said.\n The woman smiled. \"They certainly are.\"\n The men outside were watching the two women in conversation. They looked at each other and shrugged. They had every exit covered.\n Inside Dana was saying, \"I like that coat you\u0027re wearing. It\u0027s exactly my color.\"\n \"I\u0027m afraid this old thing is about worn out. Yours is very pretty.\"\n The two men outside watched as the conversation continued.\n \"It\u0027s damned cold,\" one of the men complained. \"I wish she\u0027d get the hell out here and let us get this over with.\"\n His companion nodded. \"There\u0027s no way she can get - \" He broke off as he saw the two women in the store start to exchange coats. He grinned. \"Jesus, look what she\u0027s trying to get away with. They\u0027re swapping coats. What a dumb broad.\"\n The two women disappeared for a moment behind a clothes rack. One of the men spoke into the walkie-talkie. \"The subject is switching from her red coat into a green coat...Hold it. She\u0027s heading for exit four. Pick her up there.\"\n At exit four, two men were waiting. A moment later one of them said into his cellular phone, \"We\u0027ve got her. Get the car.\"\n They watched as she came out the door into the cold air. She wrapped her green coat tightly around her and started down the street. They closed in on her. As she reached the corner and started hailing a cab, the men grabbed her arms. \"You don\u0027t need a cab. We have a nice car for you.\"\n She looked at them in astonishment. \"Who are you? What are you talking about?\"\n One of the men was staring at her. \"You\u0027re not Dana Evans!\"\n \"Well, of course I\u0027m not.\"\n The men looked at each other, let go of her, and raced back to the store. One of the men clicked on his walkie-talkie. \"Wrong target. Wrong target. Do you read me?\"\n By the time the others piled into the store, Dana had disappeared.\n She was caught in a living nightmare, trapped in a hostile world with unknown enemies trying to kill her. She was enmeshed in a web of terror, almost paralyzed with fear. When Dana got out of the taxi, she started walking fast, trying not to run and call attention to herself, having no idea where she was going. She passed a store with a sign that saidFANTASY HEADQUARTERS :FANCY DRESS FOR ALL OCCASIONS . On an impulse, Dana went inside. It was filled with costumes, wigs, and makeup.\n \"Can I help you?\"\n Yes. Call the police. Tell them someone is trying to kill me.\n \"Miss?\"\n \"Er - yes. I would like to try on a blond wig.\"\n \"This way, please.\"\n A minute later Dana was looking at her blond image in the mirror.\n \"It\u0027s amazing how much it changes your appearance.\"\n I hope so.\n Outside the store, Dana flagged down a taxi. \"O\u0027Hare airport.\"I must get to Kemal.\n When the telephone rang, Rachel picked it up. \"Hello...Dr. Young?...The final results of the test?\"\n Jeff saw the sudden tension in her face.\n \"You can tell me over the phone. Just a minute.\" Rachel looked at Jeff, took a deep breath, and took the phone into the bedroom.\n He could hear her voice, faintly.\n \"Go ahead, Doctor.\"\n There was a silence that lasted a full three minutes, and as Jeff, concerned, was about to go into the bedroom, Rachel came out, and she had a glow on her face that he had never seen before.\n \"It worked!\" She was almost breathless with excitement. \"Jeff, I\u0027m in remission. The new therapy worked!\"\n Jeff said, \"Thank God! That\u0027s wonderful, Rachel.\"\n \"He wants me to stay here for another few weeks, but the crisis is over.\" Her voice was filled with elation.\n \"We\u0027ll go out and celebrate,\" Jeff said. \"I\u0027ll stay with you until - \"\n \"No.\"\n \"No, what?\"\n \"I don\u0027t need you anymore, Jeff.\"\n \"I know, and I\u0027m glad we - \"\n \"You don\u0027t understand. I want you to leave.\"\n He looked at Rachel, surprised. \"Why?\"\n \"Dear, sweet Jeff. I don\u0027t want to hurt your feelings, but now that I\u0027m in remission, it means I can go back to work. It\u0027s my life. It\u0027s what I am. I\u0027m going to call and see what jobs are available. I\u0027ve felt trapped here with you. Thanks for helping me, Jeff. I really do appreciate it. But it\u0027s time to say good-bye. I\u0027m sure Dana misses you. So please, why don\u0027t you just leave, darling?\"\n Jeff looked at her a moment and nodded. \"Right.\"\n Rachel watched him go into the bedroom and start to pack. Twenty minutes later, when Jeff came out with his suitcase, Rachel was on the phone.\n \"...and I\u0027ve come back to the real world, Betty. I\u0027ll be able to go back to work in a few weeks...I know. Isn\u0027t it wonderful?\"\n Jeff was standing there, waiting to say good-bye. Rachel waved to him and turned back to the telephone. \"I\u0027ll tell you what I want...get me a shoot on a nice tropical...\"\n Rachel watched Jeff walk out the door. Slowly, she let the phone drop. She walked over to the window and stood there, watching the only man she had ever loved walk out of her life.\n Dr. Young\u0027s words were still ringing in her ears. \"Miss Stevens, I\u0027m sorry, but I have bad news. The treatment didn\u0027t work...The cancer has metastasized...It has spread too far. I\u0027m afraid that it\u0027s terminal...maybe another month or two...\"\n Rachel remembered the Hollywood director Roderick Marshall saying to her, \"I\u0027m glad you came. I\u0027m going to make you a big star.\" And as the excruciating red river of pain began to wrack Rachel\u0027s body again, she thought:Roderick Marshall would have been proud of me.\n When Dana\u0027s plane landed, Washington\u0027s Dulles airport was crowded with passengers waiting for their luggage. Dana walked past the carousels out into the street and climbed into one of the waiting taxis. There were no suspicious-looking men around, but her nerves were screaming. Dana took out her purse and looked in the small mirror for reassurance. Her blond wig did give her a completely different look. It will have to do for now, Dana thought. I\u0027ve got to get to Kemal.\n Kemal opened his eyes slowly, awakened by the sounds of voices coming through the closed study door. He felt groggy.\n \"The boy\u0027s still asleep,\" he heard Mrs. Daley say. \"I drugged him.\"\n A man replied, \"We\u0027ll have to wake him up.\"\n A second man\u0027s voice said, \"Maybe it would be better if we carried him there while he\u0027s asleep.\"\n \"You could do it to him here,\" Mrs. Daley said. \"And then get rid of his body.\"\n Kemal was suddenly wide awake.\n \"We have to keep him alive for a while. They\u0027re going to use him as bait to catch the Evans woman.\"\n Kemal sat up, listening, his heart pounding.\n \"Where is she?\"\n \"We\u0027re not sure. But we know she\u0027ll be coming here for the kid.\"\n Kemal jumped out of bed. He stood there for a moment, rigid with fear. The woman he had trusted wanted to kill him. Pizda! It won\u0027t be that easy, Kemal swore to himself. They couldn\u0027t kill me in Sarajevo. They\u0027re not going to kill me here. He began frantically throwing on his clothes. When he reached for his artificial arm on the chair, it slipped out of his hand and fell to the floor with what sounded to Kemal like a thunderous crash. He froze. The men outside were still talking. They had not heard it. Kemal attached his arm and finished dressing quickly.\n He opened the window and was hit by a blast of frigid air. His overcoat was in the other room. Kemal moved out onto the window ledge in his thin jacket, his teeth chattering. There was a fire escape leading to the ground, and he climbed onto it, careful to duck out of sight of the living-room window.\n As Kemal reached the ground, he looked at his watch. It was 2:45. Somehow he had slept half the day away. He began to run.\n \"Let\u0027s tie the kid down, just in case.\"\n One of the men opened the study door and looked around the room in surprise. \"Hey, he\u0027s gone!\"\n The two men and Mrs. Daley rushed to the open window in time to see Kemal racing down the street.\n \"Get him!\"\n Kemal ran as if in a nightmare; his legs growing weaker and more rubbery with every step. Each breath was a knife in his chest. If I can get to the school before they close the gates at three o\u0027clock, he thought, I\u0027ll be safe. They won\u0027t dare hurt me with all the other kids around.\n There was a red traffic light ahead. Kemal ignored it and darted across the avenue, dodging cars, oblivious to the outraged sounds of automobile horns and screaming brakes. He reached the other side of the street and kept running.\n Miss Kelly will call the police, and they\u0027ll protect Dana.\n Kemal was beginning to get short of breath and he felt a tightness in his chest. He glanced at his watch again: 2:55. He looked up. The school was just ahead. Two more blocks to go.\n I\u0027m safe, Kemal thought. They haven\u0027t dismissed classes yet. A minute later he reached the front gate. He stopped in front of it and stared at it, unbelievingly. It was locked. Suddenly, from behind, Kemal felt an iron grip on his shoulder.\n \"It\u0027s Saturday, stupid.\"\n \"Stop here,\" Dana said. The taxi was two blocks from her apartment. Dana watched the cab drive away. She walked slowly, her body tense, every sense alert, scanning the streets, looking for anything out of the ordinary. She was sure that Kemal was safe. Jack Stone would be protecting him.\n When Dana reached the apartment-house corner, she avoided the front entrance and stepped into the alley that led to the back of the building. It was deserted. Dana went inside the service door and quietly walked up the stairs. She reached the second floor and started down the hall and suddenly stopped. The door to her apartment was wide open. Dana was instantly flooded with fear. She ran toward the door and raced inside. \"Kemal!\"\n No one was there. Dana dashed through the apartment, frantic, wondering what could have happened. Where was Jack Stone? Where was Kemal? In the kitchen, a cabinet drawer had fallen to the floor and its contents had spilled out. There were dozens of small packets, some full, some empty. Curious, Dana picked one up and looked at it. The label said, BuSpar 15 mg tablets marked NDC D087 D822-32.\n What were they? Was Mrs. Daley on drugs, or had she been giving these to Kemal? Could it have anything to do with the change in his behavior? Dana put one of the packets in her coat pocket.\n Filled with dread, Dana slipped out of the apartment. She went out the back way, into the alley, and headed for the street. As Dana turned the corner, a man hidden behind a tree spoke into a walkie-talkie to his confederate standing on the opposite corner.\n Ahead of Dana was the Washington Pharmacy. Dana went inside.\n The pharmacist said, \"Ah, Miss Evans. Can I help you?\"\n \"Yes, Coquina. I\u0027m curious about this.\" She took out the small packet. The pharmacist glanced at it. \"BuSpar. It\u0027s an anti-anxiety agent. White crystal, water soluble.\"\n \"What does it do?\" Dana asked.\n \"It\u0027s a relaxant. It has a calming effect. Of course, if you overdose, it can cause drowsiness and fatigue.\"\n He\u0027s asleep. Shall I wake him up?\n When he came home from school, he felt tired, so I thought a nap would be good for him...\n So that explained what had been going on. And it had been Pamela Hudson who had sent Mrs. Daley.\n And I put Kemal in that bitch\u0027s hands, Dana thought. She felt sick to her stomach.\n She looked at the pharmacist. \"Thank you, Coquina.\"\n \"My pleasure, Miss Evans.\"\n Dana went out the door back into the street. The two men were approaching her. \"Miss Evans, could we talk to you for a min - \" Dana turned and ran. The men were at her heels. Dana reached the corner. A policeman in the middle of the intersection was directing the heavy traffic.\n Dana ran out into the street toward him.\n \"Hey! Go back, miss.\"\n Dana kept coming.\n \"You\u0027re moving against the light! Did you hear me? Get back!\"\n The two men were waiting at the corner, watching.\n \"Are you deaf?\" the policeman yelled.\n \"Shut up!\" She slapped the policeman hard across the face. The furious officer grabbed Dana\u0027s arm.\n \"You\u0027re under arrest, ma\u0027am.\"\n He pulled Dana back to the sidewalk and held on to her while he talked into his radio. \"I need a black-and-white.\"\n The two men stood there looking at each other, uncertain what to do.\n Dana looked across at them and smiled. There was the sound of an approaching siren and a few seconds later a police car came to a stop in front of them.\n The two men watched helplessly as Dana was put into the backseat of the patrol car and driven away.\n At the police station, Dana said, \"I\u0027m entitled to one phone call, right?\"\n The sergeant said, \"Right.\"\n He handed Dana a phone. She made her call.\n A dozen blocks away the man holding Kemal by his shirt collar was pulling him toward a limousine waiting at the curb, its motor running.\n \"Please! Please let me go,\" Kemal pleaded.\n \"Shut up, kid.\"\n Four uniformed marines were passing by.\n \"I don\u0027t want to go in the alley with you,\" Kemal yelled.\n The man looked at Kemal puzzled. \"What?\"\n \"Please don\u0027t make me go in the alley.\" Kemal turned to the marines. \"He wants to pay me five dollars to go in the alley with him. I don\u0027t want to.\"\n The marines stopped, staring at the man. \"Why, you dirty pervert...\"\n The man backed away. \"No, no. Wait a minute. You don\u0027t understand...\"\n One of the marines said grimly, \"Yes, we do, buddy. Get your hands off the kid.\" They surrounded the man. He put his hands up to defend himself, and Kemal quickly slipped away.\n A delivery boy with a package was getting off a bicycle and starting toward a house. Kemal jumped onto the bicycle and pedaled furiously away. The man watched, frustrated, as Kemal rounded the corner and disappeared. The marines were closing in on him.\n At the police station, Dana\u0027s cell door clanged open.\n \"You\u0027re free to go, Miss Evans. You\u0027re out on bail.\"\n Matt! The phone call worked, Dana thought happily. He didn\u0027t lose any time.\n As Dana started toward the exit, she stopped in shock. One of the men was standing there, waiting for her.\n He smiled at Dana and said, \"You\u0027re free, sis. Let\u0027s go.\" He gripped Dana\u0027s arm tightly and started herding her out to the street. As they stepped outside, the man stopped in astonishment. A full television crew from WTN was waiting in front.\n \"Look this way, Dana...\"\n \"Dana, is it true that you slapped a policeman?\"\n \"Can you tell us what happened?\"\n \"Did he harass you?\"\n \"Are you going to press charges?\"\n The man was shying away, covering his face.\n \"What\u0027s the matter?\" Dana called. \"Don\u0027t you want your picture taken?\"\n He fled.\n Matt Baker appeared at Dana\u0027s side. \"Let\u0027s get the hell out of here.\"\n They were in Matt Baker\u0027s office at the WTE building. Elliot Cromwell, Matt Baker, and Abbe Lasmann had been listening to Dana for the last half hour in shocked silence.\n \"...and the FRA is involved, too. That\u0027s why General Booster tried to stop me from investigating.\"\n Elliot Cromwell said, \"I\u0027m stunned. How could we all have been so wrong about Taylor Winthrop? I think we should inform the White House about what\u0027s happening. Let them call in the attorney general and the FBI.\"\n Dana said, \"Elliot, so far we only have my word against Roger Hudson\u0027s. Who do you think they\u0027re going to believe?\"\n Abbe Lasmann said, \"Don\u0027t we have any proof?\"\n \"Sasha Shdanoff\u0027s brother is alive. I\u0027m sure he\u0027ll talk. Once we pull a single thread, the whole story is going to unravel.\"\n Matt Baker took a deep breath and looked at Dana admiringly. \"When you go after a story, you go after a story.\"\n Dana said, \"Matt, what are we going to do about Kemal? I don\u0027t know where to look.\"\n Matt said firmly, \"Don\u0027t worry. We\u0027ll find him. Meanwhile, we have to get a place for you to hide where no one can findyou. \"\n Abbe Lasmann spoke up. \"You can use my apartment. No one will think of looking for you there.\"\n \"Thank you.\" Dana turned to Matt. \"About Kemal...\"\n \"We\u0027ll get the FBI on it right away. I\u0027ll have a driver take you to Abbe\u0027s apartment. It\u0027s in our hands now, Dana. Everything\u0027s going to be fine. I\u0027ll call you the minute I hear something.\"\n Kemal pedaled along the icy streets, anxiously looking behind him every few moments. There was no sign of the man who had grabbed him. I\u0027ve got to get to Dana, Kemal thought, desperately. I can\u0027t let them hurt her. The problem was that the WTN studio was at the other end of downtown Washington.\n When Kemal came to a bus stop, he got off the bicycle and pushed it onto the grass. As a bus approached, Kemal felt in his pockets and realized he had no money.\n Kemal turned to a passerby. \"Excuse me, could I have a - \"\n \"Get lost, kid.\"\n Kemal tried a woman who was approaching. \"Excuse me, I need bus fare to - \" The woman hurried by.\n Kemal stood in the cold, without a coat, shivering. No one seemed to care. I\u0027ve got to get bus fare, Kemal thought.\n He yanked off his artificial arm and laid it on the grass. When the next man passed by, Kemal held out his stump and said, \"Excuse me, sir. Could you give me enough money for bus fare?\"\n The man stopped. \"Of course, son,\" he said, and handed Kemal a dollar.\n \"Thank you.\"\n When the man walked away, Kemal quickly put his arm back on. A bus was approaching, just a block away. I\u0027ve made it, Kemal thought jubilantly. And at that moment, he felt a sting in the back of his neck. As he started to turn, everything grew faint. Inside his head a voice was screaming, No! No! Kemal slumped to the ground, unconscious. Passersby began to gather.\n \"What happened?\"\n \"Did he faint?\"\n \"Is he all right?\"\n \"My son is diabetic,\" a man said. \"I\u0027ll take care of him.\" He lifted Kemal up and carried him into a waiting limousine.\n Abbe Lasmann\u0027s apartment was in northwest Washington. It was large and comfortably decorated with contemporary furniture and white rugs. Dana was in the apartment alone, pacing back and forth, panicky, waiting for the phone to ring. Kemal must be all right. They have no reason to harm him. He\u0027ll be fine. Where is he? Why can\u0027t they find him?\n When the phone rang, it startled Dana. She snatched it up. \"Hello.\" The line was dead. It rang again, and Dana realized it was her cell phone. She felt a sudden sense of relief. She pressed the button. \"Jeff?\"\n Roger Hudson\u0027s voice said quietly, \"We\u0027ve been looking for you, Dana. I have Kemal here.\"\n Dana stood there, unable to move, unable to talk. She whispered at last, \"Roger - \"\n \"I\u0027m afraid I can\u0027t control the men here much more. They want to cut off Kemal\u0027s good arm. Shall I let them?\"\n \"No!\" It was a scream. \"What - what do you want?\"\n \"I just want to talk to you,\" Roger Hudson said reasonably. \"I want you to come to the house, and I want you to come alone. If you bring anyone, I won\u0027t be responsible for what happens to Kemal.\"\n \"Roger - \"\n \"I\u0027ll expect you in thirty minutes.\" The line went dead.\n Dana stood there, numb with fear. Nothing must happen to Kemal. Nothing must happen to Kemal. With trembling fingers, Dana punched in Matt Baker\u0027s phone number. Matt\u0027s recorded voice came on.\n \"You have reached the office of Matt Baker. I\u0027m not in right now, but leave a message and your call will be returned as soon as possible.\"\n There was the sound of a beep. Dana took a deep breath and spoke into the phone. \"Matt, I - I just got a call from Roger Hudson. He\u0027s holding Kemal at his house. I\u0027m going there now. Please hurry before something happens to Kemal. Bring the police. Hurry! \"\n Dana turned off her cell phone and headed for the door.\n Abbe Lasmann was putting some letters on Matt Baker\u0027s desk when she saw the message display flashing on Matt\u0027s telephone. She dialed Matt\u0027s password and played Dana\u0027s recording. She stood there a moment, listening to it. Then she smiled and pressed the erase button.\n The moment Jeff\u0027s plane landed at Dulles airport, he called Dana. All through the flight, he had thought of that strange note in her voice, that disturbing \"If anything should happen to me.\" Her cell phone kept ringing. Next Jeff tried her apartment. There was no answer. He got into a taxi and gave the address of WTN.\n When Jeff walked into Matt\u0027s reception office, Abbe said, \"Well, Jeff! It\u0027s good to see you.\"\n \"Thanks, Abbe.\" He walked into Matt Baker\u0027s office.\n Matt said, \"So, you\u0027re back. How\u0027s Rachel?\"\n The question threw Jeff for an instant. \"She\u0027s fine,\" he said tonelessly. \"Where\u0027s Dana? She\u0027s not answering her phone.\"\n Matt said, \"My God, you don\u0027t know what\u0027s been going on, do you?\"\n \"Tell me,\" Jeff said tightly.\n In the reception office, Abbe pressed her ear against the closed door. She could only hear snatches of the conversation. \"...attempts on her life...Sasha Shdanoff...Krasnoyarsk-26...Kemal...Roger Hudson...\"\n Abbe had heard enough. She hurried to her desk and picked up the telephone. A minute later she was talking to Roger Hudson.\n Inside the office, Jeff was listening to Matt, stunned. \"I can\u0027t believe it.\"\n \"It\u0027s all true,\" Matt Baker assured him. \"Dana\u0027s at Abbe\u0027s. I\u0027ll have Abbe try her apartment again.\" He pressed down the intercom, but before he could speak, he heard Abbe\u0027s voice.\n \"...and Jeff Connors is here. He\u0027s looking for Dana. I think you\u0027d better get her out of there. They\u0027re going to be coming over there...Right. I\u0027ll take care of it, Mr. Hudson. If - \"\n Abbe heard a sound and turned. Jeff Connors and Matt Baker were standing in the doorway, staring at her.\n Matt said, \"You bitch.\"\n Jeff turned to Matt, frantic. \"I have to get to the Hudson house. I need a car.\"\n Matt Baker glanced out the window. \"You\u0027ll never get there in time. The traffic is bumper-to-bumper.\"\n From the heliport on the roof, they heard the sound of the WTN helicopter landing. The two men looked at each other. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-sky-is-falling/page-25.html","bookId":2369,"book":{"id":2369,"title":"The Sky Is Falling","description":"Storyline: \n Washington TV anchorwoman Dana Evans (from Best Laid Plans) suspects the accidents befalling the rich Winthrop family, killing all five members, were murders.
