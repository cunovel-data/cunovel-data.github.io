{"id":69485,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"THAT EVENING WHEN Dana returned to her room, she stopped in sudden alarm. Everything looked the same, and yet...she had a feeling something was different. Had her things been moved? It\u0027s Chicken Little time, Dana thought wryly. She picked up the telephone and called home.\\n\\n Mrs. Daley answered the phone. \"The Evans residence.\"\\n\\n Thank God she was still there. \"Mrs. Daley?\"\\n\\n \"Miss Evans!\"\\n\\n \"Good evening. How is Kemal?\"\\n\\n \"Well, he can be a bit of a devil, but I can handle him. My boys were like that.\"\\n\\n \"Then everything is...all right?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, yes.\"\\n\\n Dana\u0027s sigh was of pure relief. \"Could I speak to him?\"\\n\\n \"Certainly.\" Dana heard her call, \"Kemal, it\u0027s your mother.\"\\n\\n A moment later Kemal was on the phone. \"Hi, Dana.\"\\n\\n \"Hi, Kemal. How are you doing, pal?\"\\n\\n \"Cool.\"\\n\\n \"How was school?\"\\n\\n \"It was okay.\"\\n\\n \"And are you getting along all right with Mrs. Daley?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, she\u0027s rad.\"\\n\\n She\u0027s more than rad, Dana thought. She\u0027s a miracle.\\n\\n \"When are you coming home, Dana?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll be home tomorrow. Have you had your dinner?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. It wasn\u0027t too bad, actually.\"\\n\\n Dana was almost tempted to say, Is that you, Kemal? She was thrilled at the change in him.\\n\\n \"All right, darling. I\u0027ll see you tomorrow. Good night.\"\\n\\n \"Good night, Dana.\"\\n\\n As Dana was getting ready for bed, her cell phone rang. She picked it up. \"Hello.\"\\n\\n \"Dana?\"\\n\\n She felt a surge of joy. \"Jeff! Oh, Jeff!\" She blessed the day she had purchased the international cell phone.\\n\\n \"I had to call you to tell you I miss you like bloody hell.\"\\n\\n \"I miss you, too. Are you in Florida?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"How are things there?\"\\n\\n \"Not good.\" She heard the hesitation in his voice. \"In fact, it\u0027s pretty bad. Tomorrow Rachel is scheduled to have a mastectomy.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, no!\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s not handling it well.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m so sorry.\"\\n\\n \"I know. It\u0027s rotten luck. Darling, I can\u0027t wait to get back to you. Did I ever tell you I\u0027m mad about you?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m mad about you, darling.\"\\n\\n \"Is there anything you need, Dana?\"\\n\\n You. \"No.\"\\n\\n \"How\u0027s Kemal?\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s getting along fine. I have a new housekeeper he likes.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s good news. I can\u0027t wait until we\u0027re all together again.\"\\n\\n \"Neither can I.\"\\n\\n \"You take care of yourself.\"\\n\\n \"I will. And I can\u0027t tell you how sorry I am about Rachel.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll tell her. Good night, baby.\"\\n\\n \"Good night.\"\\n\\n Dana opened her suitcase and took out a shirt of Jeff\u0027s that she had taken from the apartment. She put it on under her nightgown and hugged it to her. Good night, darling.\\n\\n Early the following morning Dana flew back to Washington. She stopped at the apartment before going to the office and was greeted by a cheerful Mrs. Daley.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s grand to see you back, Miss Evans. That boy of yours is wearing me out.\" But it was said with a twinkle.\\n\\n \"I hope he isn\u0027t giving you too much trouble.\"\\n\\n \"Trouble? Not one bit. I\u0027m pleased at how well he\u0027s doing with his new arm.\"\\n\\n Dana looked at her in surprise. \"He\u0027swearing it?\"\\n\\n \"Of course. He wears it to school.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s wonderful. I\u0027m very pleased.\" She looked at her watch. \"I have to get to the studio. I\u0027ll be back this afternoon to see Kemal.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027ll be so glad to see you. He misses you, you know. You go on ahead. I\u0027ll unpack your bags for you.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you, Mrs. Daley.\"\\n\\n Dana was in Matt\u0027s office telling him what she had learned in Aspen.\\n\\n He was looking at her incredulously. \"The day after the fire, the electrician just goddamndisappeared ?\"\\n\\n \"Without collecting his paycheck.\"\\n\\n \"And he was at the Winthrop house the day before the fire happened.\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n Matt shook his head. \"It\u0027s likeAlice in Wonderland. This gets curiouser and curiouser.\"\\n\\n \"Matt, Paul Winthrop was the next one in the family to die. He was killed in France not long after the fire. I\u0027d like to go there. I want to see if there were any witnesses to his automobile accident.\"\\n\\n \"Right.\" Then Matt added, \"Elliot Cromwell has been asking about you. He wants you to take care of yourself.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s two of us,\" Dana replied.\\n\\n When Kemal arrived home from school, Dana was waiting for him. Kemal was wearing his new arm, and it seemed to Dana that he appeared to be much calmer.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re back.\" He gave her a hug.\\n\\n \"Hello, darling. I\u0027ve missed you. How was school?\"\\n\\n \"Not bad. How was your trip?\"\\n\\n \"It was fine. I brought something back for you.\" She handed Kemal a Native American handwoven satchel and a pair of leather moccasins she had picked up in Aspen. The next part was difficult. \"Kemal, I\u0027m afraid I\u0027m going to have to go away again for a few days.\"\\n\\n Dana braced herself for his reaction, but all Kemal said was \"Okay.\"\\n\\n No sign of an outburst.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll bring you back a nice present.\"\\n\\n \"One for every day you\u0027re away?\"\\n\\n Dana smiled. \"You\u0027re supposed to be in seventh grade, not law school.\"\\n\\n He was comfortably settled in an armchair, with the television set on and a scotch in his hand. On the screen, Dana and Kemal were at the dinner table and Mrs. Daley was serving what looked like an Irish stew.\\n\\n \"This is delicious,\" Dana said.\\n\\n \"Thank you. I\u0027m glad you like it.\"\\n\\n \"I told you she was a good cook,\" Kemal said.\\n\\n It was like being in the same room with them, he thought, instead of watching them from the apartment next door.\\n\\n \"Tell me about school,\" Dana said.\\n\\n \"I like my new teachers. My math teacher is tight...\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s great.\"\\n\\n \"The boys are a lot nicer at this school. They think my new arm is rad.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll bet they do.\"\\n\\n \"One of the girls in my class is really pretty. I think she likes me. Her name is Lizzy.\"\\n\\n \"Do you like her, darling?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah. She\u0027s phat.\"\\n\\n He\u0027s growing up, Dana thought with an unexpected pang. When it was time, Kemal went to bed and Dana walked into the kitchen to see Mrs. Daley.\\n\\n \"Kemal seems so...so peaceful. I can\u0027t tell you how appreciative I am,\" Dana said.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re doingme a favor.\" Mrs. Daley smiled. \"It\u0027s like having one of my own children back. They\u0027re all grown now, you know. Kemal and I are having a grand time.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m glad.\"\\n\\n Dana waited up until midnight, and when Jeff still had not called, she went to bed. She lay there wondering what Jeff was doing, whether he was making love to Rachel, and she was ashamed of herself for her thoughts.\\n\\n The man in the next apartment reported in. \"All quiet.\"\\n\\n Her cell phone rang.\\n\\n \"Jeff, darling. Where are you?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m at Doctors Hospital in Florida. The mastectomy is over. The oncologist is still running tests.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, Jeff! I hope it hasn\u0027t spread.\"\\n\\n \"I hope so, too. Rachel wants me to stay with her for a few days. I wanted to ask you if - \"\\n\\n \"Of course. You must.\"\\n\\n \"It will only be for a little while. I\u0027ll call Matt and tell him. Anything exciting going on there?\"\\n\\n For an instant Dana was tempted to tell Jeff about Aspen and that she was going ahead with the investigation. He has enough on his mind. \"No,\" Dana said. \"All quiet.\"\\n\\n \"Give my love to Kemal. The rest is for you.\"\\n\\n Jeff replaced the receiver. A nurse came up to him.\\n\\n \"Mr. Connors? Dr. Young would like to see you.\"\\n\\n \"The operation went well,\" Dr. Young told Jeff, \"but she will need a lot of emotional support. She is going to feel less of a woman. When she wakes up, she\u0027ll be panicky. You have to let her know that it\u0027s all right to be afraid.\"\\n\\n \"I understand,\" Jeff said.\\n\\n \"And her fear and depression are going to start all over again when we begin radiation treatments to try to stop the spread of the cancer. That can be very traumatic.\"\\n\\n Jeff sat there, thinking about what lay ahead.\\n\\n \"Does she have someone to take care of her?\"\\n\\n \"Me.\" And as Jeff said it, he realized he was the only one Rachel had.\\n\\n The Air France flight to Nice was uneventful. Dana turned on her laptop computer to reexamine the information she had collected so far. Provocative, but certainly not conclusive. Proof, Dana thought. There is no story without proof. If I can -\\n\\n \"Nice flight, isn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n Dana turned to the man seated next to her. He was tall and attractive and had a French accent.\\n\\n \"Yes, it is.\"\\n\\n \"Have you been to France before?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Dana said. \"This is my first time.\"\\n\\n He smiled. \"Ah, you are in for a treat. It is a magical country.\" He smiled soulfully and leaned close to her. \"Do you have friends to show you around?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m meeting my husband and three children,\" Dana said.\\n\\n \"Dommage.\"He nodded, turned away, and picked up his copy ofFrance-Soir.\\n\\n Dana went back to her computer. An article caught her eye. Paul Winthrop, who had died in an automobile accident, had had a hobby.\\n\\n Racing cars.\\n\\n When the Air France plane landed at the Nice airport, Dana went into the busy terminal to the car-rental office. \"My name is Dana Evans. I have a - \"\\n\\n The clerk looked up. \"Ah! Miss Evans. Your car is ready.\" He handed her a form. \"Just sign this.\"\\n\\n Now that\u0027s real service, Dana thought. \"I\u0027ll need a map of the south of France. Would you happen to - ?\"\\n\\n \"Of course, mademoiselle. \" He reached behind the counter and selected a map. \"Voila.\" He stood there watching Dana leave.\\n\\n In the executive tower of WTN, Elliot Cromwell was saying, \"Where is Dana now, Matt?\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s in France.\"\\n\\n \"Is she making any progress?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s too early.\"\\n\\n \"I worry about her. I think maybe she\u0027s traveling too much. Today travel can be dangerous.\" He hesitated. \"Very dangerous.\"\\n\\n The air in Nice was cold and crisp, and Dana wondered what the weather had been like on the day Paul Winthrop was killed. She got into the Citroen waiting for her and started driving up the Grande Corniche, passing picturesque little villages along the way.\\n\\n The accident had happened just north of Beau-soleil, on the highway at Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, a resort that overlooked the Mediterranean Sea.\\n\\n As Dana approached the village, she slowed down, observing the sharp, precipitous curves, wondering which one Paul Winthrop had gone over. What had Paul Winthrop been doing here? Was he meeting someone? Was he taking part in a race? Was he on vacation? Business?\\n\\n Roquebrune-Cap-Martin is a medieval village with an ancient castle, church, historic caves, and luxurious villas that dot the landscape. Dana drove to the center, parked the car, and went to look for the police station. She stopped a man coming out of a shop.\\n\\n \"Excuse me, can you tell me where the police station is?\"\\n\\n \"Je ne parle pas anglais, j\u0027ai peur de ne pouvoir vous aider, mais - \"\\n\\n \"Police. Police.\"\\n\\n \"Ah, oui.\"He pointed. \"La deuxi��me rue a gauche.\"\\n\\n \"Merci.\"\\n\\n \"De rien.\"\\n\\n The police station was in an old, crumbling, white-walled building. Inside a middle-aged, uniformed policeman sat behind a desk. He looked up as Dana walked in.\\n\\n \"Bonjour, madame.\"\\n\\n \"Bonjour.\"\\n\\n \"Comment puis-je vous aider?\"\\n\\n \"Do you speak English?\"\\n\\n He thought about it. \"Yes,\" he said reluctantly.\\n\\n \"I would like to speak to whoever is in charge here.\"\\n\\n He looked at her a moment, a puzzled expression on his face. Then he suddenly smiled. \"Ah, Commandant Frasier. Oui. One moment.\" He picked up a telephone and spoke into it. He nodded and turned to Dana. He pointed down the corridor. \"La premi��re porte.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you.\" Dana walked down the corridor until she reached the first door. Commandant Frasier\u0027s office was small and neat. The commandant was a dapper man with a little mustache and inquisitive brown eyes. He stood up as Dana entered.\\n\\n \"Good afternoon, Commandant.\"\\n\\n \"Bonjour, mademoiselle. In what manner can I be of assistance?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m Dana Evans. I\u0027m doing a story for station WTN in Washington, D. C., about the Winthrop family. I understand that Paul Winthrop was killed in an accident around here?\"\\n\\n \"Oui. Terrible! Terrible. One must be so careful driving the Grande Corniche. It can betres dangereux. \"\\n\\n \"I heard that Paul Winthrop was killed during a race and - \"\\n\\n \"Non. There was no race that day.\"\\n\\n \"There wasn\u0027t?\"\\n\\n \"Non, mademoiselle. I myself was personally on duty when the accident occurred.\"\\n\\n \"I see. Was Mr. Winthrop in his car alone?\"\\n\\n \"Oui.\"\\n\\n \"Commandant Frasier, did they do an autopsy?\"\\n\\n \"Oui. Of course.\"\\n\\n \"Was there any alcohol in Paul Winthrop\u0027s blood?\"\\n\\n Commandant Frasier shook his head. \"Non.\"\\n\\n \"Drugs?\"\\n\\n \"Non.\"\\n\\n \"Do you remember what the weather was like that day?\"\\n\\n \"Oui. Il pleuvait. It made rain.\"\\n\\n Dana had one last question, but she asked it without any hope. \"I don\u0027t suppose there were any witnesses?\"\\n\\n \"Mais oui, il y en avait.\"\\n\\n Dana was staring at him, her pulse quickening. \"There were?\"\\n\\n \"One witness. He was driving behind Winthrop\u0027s car and saw the accident happen.\"\\n\\n Dana felt a quick sense of excitement. \"I would appreciate it very much if you would give me the witness\u0027s name,\" Dana said. \"I want to talk to him.\"\\n\\n He nodded. \"I see no harm.\" He called out, \"Alexandre!\" and a moment later his assistant came hurrying in.\\n\\n \"Oui, Commandant?\"\\n\\n \"Apportez-moi le dossier de l\u0027accident Winthrop.\"\\n\\n \"Tout de suite.\"He hurried out of the room.\\n\\n Commandant Frasier turned to Dana. \"Such an unfortunate family. Life istres fragile. \" He looked at Dana and smiled. \"One must take one\u0027s pleasure when he can.\" He added subtly, \"Or whenshe can. Are you alone here, mademoiselle ?\"\\n\\n \"No, my husband and children are waiting for me.\"\\n\\n \"Dommage.\"\\n\\n Commandant Frasier\u0027s assistant returned with a sheaf of papers and the commandant scanned the papers, nodded, and looked up at Dana.\\n\\n \"The witness to the accident was an American tourist, Ralph Benjamin. According to his statement, he was driving behind Paul Winthrop when he saw achien - a dog - run in front of Winthrop\u0027s car. Winthrop turned the wheel to not hit him, went into a big skid, and plunged off the cliff and crashed into the sea. According to the coroner\u0027s report, Winthrop died instantly.\"\\n\\n \"Do you have Mr. Benjamin\u0027s address?\" Dana asked hopefully.\\n\\n \"Oui.\"He glanced at the paper again. \"He lives in America. Richfield, Utah. Four-twenty Turk Street.\" Commandant Frasier wrote the address down and handed it to Dana.\\n\\n She tried hard to control her excitement. \"Thank you so much.\"\\n\\n \"Avec plaisir.\"He looked at Dana\u0027s bare ring finger. \"And, madame ?\"\\n\\n \"Yes?\"\\n\\n \"Say hello to your husband and children for me.\"\\n\\n Dana telephoned Matt.\\n\\n \"Matt,\" she said excitedly. \"I found a witness to Paul Winthrop\u0027s accident. I\u0027m going to interview him.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s great. Where is he?\"\\n\\n \"In Utah. Richfield. I should be back in Washington right after that.\"\\n\\n \"All right. By the way, Jeff called.\"\\n\\n \"Yes?\"\\n\\n \"You know he\u0027s in Florida with his ex-wife.\" He sounded disapproving.\\n\\n \"I know. She\u0027s very ill.\"\\n\\n \"If Jeff stays away much longer, I\u0027m going to have to ask him to take a leave of absence.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure he\u0027ll be back very soon.\" She wished she believed it.\\n\\n \"Right. Good luck with the witness.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks, Matt.\"\\n\\n Dana\u0027s next call was to Kemal. Mrs. Daley answered the phone.\\n\\n \"Miss Evans\u0027s residence.\"\\n\\n \"Good evening, Mrs. Daley. Is everything all right there?\" Dana was holding her breath.\\n\\n \"Well, your son almost burned down the kitchen helping me cook dinner last night.\" She laughed. \"But other than that, he\u0027s fine.\"\\n\\n Dana said a silent prayer of thanks. \"That\u0027s great.\"The woman really is a miracle worker, Dana thought.\\n\\n \"Will you be coming home now? I can prepare dinner and - \"\\n\\n \"I have to make one more stop,\" Dana said. \"I\u0027ll be home in two days. May I talk to Kemal?\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s asleep. Shall I wake him up?\"\\n\\n \"No, no.\" Dana looked at her watch. It was only four o\u0027clock in Washington. \"He\u0027s taking a nap?\"\\n\\n She heard Mrs. Daley\u0027s warm laugh. \"Yes. The lad has had a long day. He\u0027s working hard, and he\u0027s playing hard.\"\\n\\n \"You give him my love. I\u0027ll see him soon.\"\\n\\n I have to make one more stop. I\u0027ll be home in two days. May I talk to Kemal?\\n\\n He\u0027s asleep. Shall I wake him up?\\n\\n No, no. He\u0027s taking a nap?\\n\\n Yes. The lad has had a long day. He\u0027s working hard, and he\u0027s playing hard.\\n\\n You give him my love. I\u0027ll see him soon.\\n\\n Tape ends.\\n\\n Richfield, Utah, is a comfortable, residential town set in a bowl in the middle of the Monroe mountain range. Dana stopped at a filling station and got directions to the address Commandant Frasier had given her.\\n\\n Ralph Benjamin\u0027s home was a weatherbeaten one-story house that stood in the middle of a block of identical houses.\\n\\n Dana parked the rental car, walked up to the front door, and rang the doorbell. The door opened and a middle-aged white-haired woman in an apron stood there. \"Can I help you?\"\\n\\n \"I would like to see Ralph Benjamin,\" Dana said.\\n\\n The woman studied Dana curiously. \"Is he expecting you?\"\\n\\n \"No. I - I just happened to be passing by, and I thought I\u0027d drop in for a moment. Is he here?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. Come in.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you.\" Dana stepped inside and followed the woman into the living room.\\n\\n \"Ralph, you have a visitor.\"\\n\\n Ralph Benjamin rose from a rocking chair and moved toward Dana. \"Hello? Do I know you?\"\\n\\n Dana stood there, frozen. Ralph Benjamin was blind. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-sky-is-falling/page-14.html","bookId":2369,"book":{"id":2369,"title":"The Sky Is Falling","description":"Storyline: Washington TV anchorwoman Dana Evans (from Best Laid Plans) suspects the accidents befalling the rich Winthrop family, killing all five members, were murders.
