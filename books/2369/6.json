I have the most exciting news for you!\" \"Yes, Mother?\" \"I\u0027m getting married.\" Dana was stunned. \"What?\" \"Yes. I went up to Westport, Connecticut, to visit a friend, and she introduced me to this lovely, lovely man.\" \"I\u0027m - I\u0027m thrilled for you, Mother. That\u0027s wonderful.\" \"He\u0027s - he\u0027s so - \" She giggled. \"I can\u0027t describe him, but he\u0027s adorable. You\u0027ll love him.\" Dana said cautiously, \"How long have you known him?\" \"Long enough, darling. We\u0027re perfect for each other. I\u0027m so lucky.\" \"Does he have a job?\" Dana asked. \"Stop acting like my father. Of course he has a job. He\u0027s a very successful insurance salesman. His name is Peter Tomkins. He has a beautiful home in Westport, and I\u0027m dying for you and Kimbal to come up here and meet him. Will you come?\" \"Of course we will.\" \"Peter is so anxious to meet you. He\u0027s told everyone about how famous you are. Are you sure you can make it?\" \"Yes.\" Dana was off the air weekends, so there would be no problem. \"Kemal and I are looking forward to it.\" When Dana picked Kemal up at school, she said, \"You\u0027re going to meet your grandmother. We\u0027re going to be a real family, darling.\" \"Dope.\" Dana smiled. \"Dope is right.\" Early Saturday morning Dana and Kemal drove to Connecticut. Dana looked forward to the trip to Westport with great anticipation. \"This is going to be wonderful for everyone,\" Dana assured Kemal. \"All grandparents need grandchildren to spoil. That\u0027s the best part of having children. And you\u0027ll be able to stay with them some of the time.\" Kemal said nervously, \"Will you be there, too?\" Dana squeezed his hand. \"I\u0027ll be there.\" Peter Tomkins\u0027s home was a charming old cottage on Blind Brook Road, with a small stream running alongside it. \"Hey, this is cool,\" Kemal said. Dana ruffled Kemal\u0027s hair. \"I\u0027m glad you like it. We\u0027ll come here often.\" The front door of the cottage opened, and Eileen Evans stood there. There were still vague traces of beauty left, like clues to what once was, but bitterness had overlaid the past with a harsh brush. It was a Dorian Gray situation. Her beauty had gone into Dana. Standing beside Eileen was a middle-aged, pleasant-faced man wearing a broad smile. Eileen rushed forward and took Dana in her arms. \"Dana, darling! And there\u0027s Kimbal!\" \"Mother...\" Peter Tomkins said, \"So this is the famous Dana Evans, eh? I\u0027ve told all my clients about you.\" He turned to Kemal. \"And this is the boy.\" He noticed Kemal\u0027s missing arm. \"Hey, you didn\u0027t tell me he was a cripple.\" Dana\u0027s blood froze. She saw the shock on Kemal\u0027s face. Peter Tomkins shook his head. \"If he had had insurance with our company before that happened, he\u0027d be a rich kid.\" He turned toward the door. \"Come on in. You must be hungry.\" \"Not anymore,\" Dana said tightly. She turned to Eileen. \"I\u0027m sorry, Mother. Kemal and I are going back to Washington.\" \"I\u0027m sorry, Dana. I - \" \"So am I. I hope you\u0027re not making a big mistake. Have a nice wedding.\" \"Dana - \" Dana\u0027s mother watched in dismay as Dana and Kemal got into the car and drove away. Peter Tomkins looked after them in astonishment. \"Hey, what did I say?\" Eileen Evans sighed. \"Nothing, Peter. Nothing.\" Kemal was silent on the ride home. Dana glanced at him from time to time. \"I\u0027m so sorry, darling. Some people are just ignorant.\" \"He\u0027s right,\" Kemal said bitterly. \"I am a cripple.\" \"You\u0027renot a cripple,\" Dana said fiercely. \"You don\u0027t judge people by how many arms or legs they have. You judge them by what they are.\" \"Yeah? And what am I?\" \"You\u0027re a survivor. And I\u0027m proud of you. You know, Mr. Charming was right about one thing - I\u0027m hungry. I guess it wouldn\u0027t interest you, but I see a McDonald\u0027s ahead.\" Kemal smiled. \"Awesome.\" After Kemal went to bed, Dana walked into the living room and sat down to think. She turned on the television set and started surfing the news channels. They were all doing follow-up stories on the Gary Winthrop murder. \"...hoping that the stolen van might offer some clues to the identity of the murderers...\" \"...two bullets from a Beretta. Police are checking all gun shops to...\" \"...and the brutal murder of Gary Winthrop in the exclusive northwest area proved that no one is...\" There was something at the back of Dana\u0027s mind, teasing her. It took her hours to get to sleep. In the morning, when Dana awakened, she suddenly realized what had been bothering her. Money and jewels were lying in the open. Why hadn\u0027t the killers taken them? Dana got up and made a pot of coffee while she reviewed what Chief Burnett had said. Do you have a list of the stolen paintings? We do. They\u0027re all well known. The list is being circulated to museums, art dealers, and collectors. The minute one of those paintings appears, the case will be solved. The burglars must have known that the paintings couldn\u0027t be sold easily, Dana thought, which could mean that the theft was arranged by a wealthy collector who intends to keep the paintings for himself. But why would a man like that put himself in the hands of two murderous hoodlums? On Monday morning when Kemal got up, Dana fixed breakfast and dropped him off at school. \"Have a good day, darling.\" \"See you, Dana.\" Dana watched Kemal walk into the front door of the school, and then she headed for the police station on Indiana Avenue. It was snowing again and there was a sadistic wind tearing at everything in its path. Detective Phoenix Wilson, in charge of the Gary Winthrop murder, was a street-smart misanthrope, with a few scars to show how he had gotten that way. He looked up as Dana walked into his office. \"No interviews,\" he growled. \"When there\u0027s any new information on the Winthrop murder, you\u0027ll hear it at the press conference with everybody else.\" \"I didn\u0027t come to ask you about that,\" Dana said. He eyed her skeptically. \"Oh, really?\" \"Really. I\u0027m interested in the paintings that were stolen. You have a list of them, I assume?\" \"So?\" \"Could you give me a copy?\" Detective Wilson asked suspiciously, \"Why? What did you have in mind?\" \"I\u0027d like to see what the killers took. I might do a segment on the air.\" Detective Wilson studied Dana a moment. \"That\u0027s not a bad idea. The more publicity these paintings get, the less chance the killers will have to sell them.\" He rose. \"They took twelve paintings and left a lot more. I guess they were too lazy to carry them all. Good help is hard to find these days. I\u0027ll get you a copy of that report.\" He was back in a few minutes with two photocopies. He handed them to Dana. \"Here\u0027s a list of the ones taken. Here\u0027s the other list.\" Dana looked at him, puzzled. \"What other list?\" \"All the paintings Gary Winthrop owned, including the paintings the killers left behind.\" \"Oh. Thank you. I appreciate it.\" Out in the corridor, Dana examined the two lists. What she was seeing was confusing. Dana walked out into the frigid air and headed for Christie\u0027s, the world-famous auction house. It was snowing harder, and the crowds were hurrying to finish their Christmas shopping and get back to their warm homes and offices. When Dana arrived at Christie\u0027s, the manager recognized her immediately. \"Well! This is an honor, Miss Evans. What can we do for you?\" Dana explained, \"I have two lists of paintings here. I would appreciate it if someone could tell me what these paintings are worth.\" \"But of course. It would be our pleasure. Come this way, please...\" Two hours later Dana was in Matt Baker\u0027s office. \"There\u0027s something very strange going on,\" Dana began. \"We\u0027re not back to the Chicken Little conspiracy theory again, are we?\" \"You tell me.\" Dana handed Matt the longer of the two lists. \"This hasall the artworks Gary Winthrop owned. I just had these paintings appraised at Christie\u0027s.\" Matt Baker scanned the list. \"Hey, I see some heavy hitters here. Vincent van Gogh, Hals, Matisse, Monet, Picasso, Manet.\" He looked up. \"So?\" \"Now look atthis list,\" Dana said. She handed Matt the shorter list, which had the stolen art on it. Matt read them aloud. \"Camille Pissarro, Marie Laurencin, Paul Klee, Maurice Utrillo, Henry Lebasque. So what\u0027s your point?\" Dana said slowly, \"A lot of the paintings on the complete list are worth more than ten million apiece.\" She paused. \"Most of the paintings on the shorter list, which were stolen, are worth two hundred thousand apiece or less.\" Matt Baker blinked. \"The burglars took the less valuable paintings?\" \"That\u0027s right.\" Dana leaned forward. \"Matt, if they were professional burglars, they would also have taken the cash and jewelry lying around. We were meant to assume that someone hired them to steal only the more valuable paintings. But according to these lists, they didn\u0027t know a thing about art. So why were they really hired? Gary Winthrop wasn\u0027t armed. Why did they kill him?\" \"Are you saying that the robbery was a cover-up, and the real motive for the break-in was murder?\" \"That\u0027s the only explanation I can think of.\" Matt swallowed. \"Let\u0027s examine this. Suppose that Taylor Winthropdid make an enemy and was murdered - why would anyone want to wipe out his entire family?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" Dana said. \"That\u0027s what I want to find out.\" Dr. Armand Deutsch was one of Washington\u0027s most respected psychiatrists, an imposing-looking man in his seventies, with a broad forehead and appropriately probing blue eyes. He glanced up as Dana entered. \"Miss Evans?\" \"Yes. I appreciate your seeing me, Doctor. What I need to see you about is really very important.\" \"And what is it that\u0027s so very important?\" \"You\u0027ve read about the deaths in the Winthrop family?\" \"Of course. Terrible tragedies. So many accidents.\" Dana said, \"What if they weren\u0027t accidents?\" \"What? What are you saying?\" \"That there\u0027s a possibility they were all murdered.\" \"The Winthropsmurdered ? That seems very far-fetched, Miss Evans. Very far-fetched.\" \"But possible.\" \"What makes you think they might have been murdered?\" \"It\u0027s - it\u0027s just a hunch,\" Dana admitted. \"I see. A hunch.\" Dr. Deutsch sat there, studying her. \"I watched your broadcasts from Sarajevo. You are an excellent reporter.\" \"Thank you.\" Dr. Deutsch leaned forward on his elbows, his blue eyes fixed on hers. \"So, not long ago, you were in the middle of a terrible war. Yes?\" \"Yes.\" \"Reporting about people being raped, killed, babies murdered...\" Dana was listening, wary. \"You were obviously under great stress.\" Dana said, \"Yes.\" \"How long have you been back - five, six months?\" \"Three months,\" Dana said. He nodded, satisfied. \"Not much time to get adjusted to civilian life again, is it? You must have nightmares about all the terrible murders you witnessed, and now your subconscious mind imagines - \" Dana interrupted him. \"Doctor, I\u0027m not paranoid. I have no proof, but I have reason to believe the Winthrop deaths were not accidental. I came to see you because I was hoping you could help me.\" \"Help you? In what way?\" \"I need a motive. What motive could anyone have for wiping out an entire family?\" Dr. Deutsch looked at Dana and steepled his fingers. \"There are precedents, of course, for such violent aggression. A vendetta...vengeance. In Italy, the Mafia has been known to kill entire families. Or it could possibly involve drugs. It might be revenge for some terrible tragedy that the family caused. Or it could be a maniac who might not have any rational motive to - \" \"I don\u0027t think that\u0027s the case here,\" Dana said. \"Then, of course, there\u0027s one of the oldest motives in the world - money.\" Money. Dana had already thought of that. Walter Calkin, head of the firm of Calkin, Taylor \u0026 Anderson, had been the Winthrops\u0027 family lawyer for more than twenty-five years. He was an elderly man, crippled with arthritis, but while his body was frail, his mind was still keen. He studied Dana a moment. \"You told my secretary that you wanted to talk to me about the Winthrop estate?\" \"Yes.\" He sighed. \"It\u0027s incredible to me what happened to that wonderful family. Incredible.\" \"I understand that you handled their legal and financial affairs,\" Dana said. \"Yes.\" \"Mr. Calkin, in the last year, was there anything unusual about those affairs?\" He was looking at Dana curiously. \"Unusual in what sense?\" Dana said carefully, \"This is awkward, but - would you be aware of it if any member of the family was...being blackmailed?\" There was a momentary silence. \"You mean, would I know if they were regularly paying out large sums of money to somebody?\" \"Yes.\" \"I suppose I would, yes.\" \"Andwas there anything like that?\" Dana pursued. \"Nothing. I assume you\u0027re suggesting some sort of foul play? I must tell you I find that utterly ridiculous.\" \"But they are all dead,\" Dana said. \"The estate must be worth many billions of dollars. I would very much appreciate it if you could tell me who stands to receive that money.\" She watched the lawyer open a bottle of pills, take one out, and swallow it with a sip of water. \"Miss Evans, we never discuss our clients\u0027 affairs.\" He hesitated. \"In this instance, however, I see no harm in it, because a press announcement is going to be made tomorrow.\" And then there\u0027s always one of the oldest motives in the world - money. Walter Calkin looked at Dana. \"With the death of Gary Winthrop, the last surviving member of the family - \" \"Yes?\" Dana was holding her breath. \"The entire Winthrop fortune goes to charity.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-sky-is-falling/page-6.html","bookId":2369,"book":{"id":2369,"title":"The Sky Is Falling","description":"Storyline: Washington TV anchorwoman Dana Evans (from Best Laid Plans) suspects the accidents befalling the rich Winthrop family, killing all five members, were murders.
