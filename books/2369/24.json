{"id":69495,"no":24,"title":"Page 24","content":"INRAVENHILL, a red NO TRESPASSING sign and high iron fence excluded the world from the wooded acres of the headquarters the FRA had established in England. Behind the closely guarded base, a series of satellite-tracking dishes monitored international cable and microwave communications passing through Britain. In a concrete house in the center of the compound, four men were watching a large screen.\n \"Beam her up, Scotty.\"\n They watched the television picture shift away from a flat in Brighton as the satellite moved. A moment later an image of Dana came up on the large screen as she entered her room at the Soyuz Hotel.\n \"She\u0027s back.\" They watched as Dana hurriedly washed the blood off her hands and started to undress.\n \"Hey, here we go again.\" One of the men grinned.\n They watched as Dana stripped.\n \"Man, I\u0027d sure like to bonk that.\"\n Another man hurried into the room. \"Not unless you\u0027re into necrophilia, Charlie.\"\n \"What are you talking about?\"\n \"We just got orders to see that she has a fatal accident.\"\n Dana finished dressing and looked at her watch. There was still plenty of time to catch the Metropol bus to the airport. With growing anxiety, she hurried downstairs to the lobby. The fat woman was nowhere in sight.\n Dana walked out onto the street. Impossibly, it had gotten colder. The wind was a relentless, howling banshee. A taxi stopped in front of Dana.\n \"Taksi?\"\n Don\u0027t take a taxi. Go directly to the Hotel Metropol. The hotel has airport buses leaving regularly.\n \"Nyet.\"\n Dana started walking along the icy street. Crowds were pushing past her, hurrying to the warmth of homes or offices. As Dana reached a busy corner, waiting to cross, she felt a violent shove from behind and she went flying into the street in front of an oncoming truck. She slipped on a patch of ice and fell on her back, looking up in horror as the huge truck sped toward her.\n At the last second, the white-faced driver managed to turn his wheel so that the truck passed directly over Dana. For a moment, she lay in darkness, her ears filled with the roar of the engine and the clanking chains flapping against the huge tires.\n Suddenly she could see the sky again. The truck was gone. Dana groggily sat up. People were helping her to her feet. She looked around for the person who had pushed her, but it could have been anyone in the crowd. Dana took several deep breaths and tried to regain her composure. The people surrounding her were shouting at her in Russian. The crowd was beginning to press in on Dana, making her panicky.\n \"Hotel Metropol?\" Dana said hopefully.\n A group of young boys had approached. \"Sure. We take you.\"\n The lobby of the Hotel Metropol was blessedly warm, crowded with tourists and businessmen. Mingle with the crowds. I\u0027ll be waiting for you in Washington when you arrive.\n Dana said to a bellman, \"What time does the next bus leave for the airport?\"\n \"In thirty minutes, gaspazha. \"\n \"Thank you.\"\n She sat in a chair, breathing hard, trying to wipe the unspeakable horror from her mind. She was filled with dread. Who was trying to kill her and why? And was Kemal safe?\n The bellman came up to Dana. \"The airport bus is here.\"\n Dana was the first one on the bus. She took a seat at the rear and studied the faces of the passengers. There were tourists from half a dozen countries: Europeans, Asians, Africans, and a few Americans. A man across the aisle was staring at her.\n He looks familiar, Dana thought. Has he been following me? She found herself hyperventilating.\n One hour later, when the bus stopped at Sheremetyevo II airport, Dana was the last one to disembark. She hurried into the terminal building and over to the Air France desk.\n \"May I help you?\"\n \"Do you have a reservation for Dana Evans?\" Dana was holding her breath. Say yes, say yes, say yes ...\n The clerk sorted through some papers. \"Yes. Here\u0027s your ticket. It\u0027s paid for.\"\n Bless Roger. \"Thank you.\"\n \"The plane is on schedule. That\u0027s flight two-twenty. It will be leaving in one hour and ten minutes.\"\n \"Is there a lounge\" - Dana almost said, with a lot of people - \"where I can rest?\"\n \"Down the end of this corridor and to the right.\"\n \"Thank you.\"\n The lounge was crowded. Nothing in there seemed unusual or threatening. Dana took a seat. In a little while, she would be on her way to America and safety.\n \"Air France flight two-twenty is now boarding at gate three for Washington, D. C. Will all passengers please have their passports and boarding passes ready?\"\n Dana rose and started toward gate 3. A man who had been watching her from an Aeroflot counter spoke into his cell phone.\n \"The subject is heading for the boarding gate.\"\n Roger Hudson picked up the phone and called a number. \"She\u0027s on Air France flight two-twenty. I want her picked up at the airport.\"\n \"What do you want done with her, sir?\"\n \"I would suggest a hit-and-run accident.\"\n They were flying at a smooth forty-five thousand feet in a cloudless sky. There was not an empty seat on the plane. An American was in the seat next to Dana.\n \"Gregory Price,\" he said. \"I\u0027m in lumber.\" He was in his forties, with a long aquiline face, bright gray eyes, and a mustache. \"That\u0027s some kind of country we\u0027re leaving, huh?\"\n Krasnoyarsk-26\u0027s sole purpose for existing is to make plutonium, the key ingredient in nuclear weapons.\n \"The Russians are sure different from us, but you get used to them after a while.\"\n One hundred thousand scientists and technicians live and work here.\n \"They sure don\u0027t cook like the French. When I come here on business, I bring my own care package.\"\n They cannot go outside. They cannot have visitors. They must cut themselves off completely from the outside world.\n \"Were you in Russia on business?\"\n Dana brought herself back to the present. \"Vacation.\"\n He looked at her in surprise. \"It\u0027s a hell of a time to take a vacation in Russia.\"\n When the flight attendant came down the aisle with a food cart, Dana started to decline, then realized she was famished. She could not remember when she had eaten last.\n Gregory Price said, \"If you\u0027d like a shot of bourbon, I\u0027ve got the real stuff here, little lady.\"\n \"No thanks.\" She looked at her watch. They would be landing in a few hours.\n When Air France flight 220 landed at Dulles airport, four men were watching as the passengers began to come through the exit ramp from the plane. The men stood there, confident, knowing there was no way she could escape.\n One of them said, \"Do you have the hypodermic?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"Take her out to Rock Creek Park. The boss wants a hit-and-run.\"\n \"Right.\"\n Their eyes turned back to the door. Passengers were streaming out, dressed in heavy woolen clothes, parkas, earmuffs, scarves, and gloves. Finally the flow of passengers stopped.\n One of the men frowned. \"I\u0027ll go and see what\u0027s keeping her.\"\n He made his way down the ramp into the plane. A cleaning crew was busily at work. The man walked through the aisle. There were no signs of any passengers. He opened the lavatory doors. They were empty. He hurried forward and said to a flight attendant who was just leaving, \"Where was Dana Evans sitting?\"\n The flight attendant looked surprised. \"Dana Evans? You mean the TV anchorwoman?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"She wasn\u0027t on this flight. I wish she had been. I would haveloved to have met her.\"\n Gregory Price was saying to Dana, \"Do you know what\u0027s great about the lumber business, little lady? Your product grows all by itself. Yes, sir, you just sit around and watch Mother Nature make money for you.\"\n A voice came over the loudspeaker.\n \"We\u0027ll be landing in Chicago\u0027s O\u0027Hare Airport in a few minutes. Please fasten your seat belt and return your seat back to the upright position.\"\n The woman seated across the aisle said cynically, \"Yeah, put your seat back upright. I wouldn\u0027t want to be leaning back when I die.\"\n The word \"die\" gave Dana a jolt. She could hear the sound of the bullets ricocheting into the wall of the apartment building and she could feel the strong hand shoving her into the path of the oncoming truck. She shuddered when she thought of the two narrow escapes she had had.\n Hours earlier, seated in the waiting lounge at Sheremetyevo II airport, Dana had told herself that everything was going to be fine. The good guys are going to win. But there was something bothering her about a conversation she had had with someone. The person had said something disturbing, but it had slipped by. Had it been in a conversation with Matt? Commissar Shdanoff? Tim Drew? The more Dana tried to recall it, the more it eluded her.\n A flight attendant announced over the loudspeaker, \"Air France flight 220 is ready to depart for Washington, D. C. Please have your passports and boarding passes in hand.\"\n Dana rose and headed for the gate. As she started to show her ticket to the guard, she suddenly remembered what it was. It was her last conversation with Sasha Shdanoff.\n No one knows I am there. It is what you call a \"safe house.\"\n The only person to whom she revealed Sasha Shdanoff\u0027s hideout was Roger Hudson. And immediately after that, Shdanoff had been murdered. From the very beginning, Roger Hudson had been subtly alluding to some dark connection between Taylor Winthrop and Russia.\n When I was in Moscow, there was a rumor that Winthrop was involved in some type of private deal with the Russians....\n Shortly before Taylor Winthrop became our ambassador to Russia, he told close friends that he had definitely retired from public life....\n It was Winthrop who pressured the president into appointing him ambassador....\n She had told Roger and Pamela her every move. They had been spying on her all the time. And there could have been only one reason:\n Roger Hudson was Taylor Winthrop\u0027s mysterious partner.\n When the American Airlines flight landed at O\u0027Hare airport in Chicago, Dana peered out the window looking for anything suspicious. Nothing. It was quiet. Dana took a deep breath and started to deplane. Her nerves were on fire. She managed to keep as many passengers around her as possible as she walked into the terminal, staying with the chattering crowd. She had an urgent call to make. During the flight, something so terrible had occurred to her that it made her own danger seem unimportant. Kemal. What if he were in danger because of her? She could not bear the thought of anything happening to him. She had to find someone to protect Kemal. Immediately, she thought of Jack Stone. He was with an organization powerful enough to give her the kind of protection she and Kemal needed, and she was sure that he would arrange it for her. He had been sympathetic to her from the beginning. He\u0027s not really one of them.\n I\u0027m trying to stay outside the loop. I can best help you that way, if you know what I mean.\n Dana walked over to a deserted corner of the terminal, reached in her purse, and took out the private number Jack Stone had given her. She called it. He answered immediately.\n \"Jack Stone.\"\n \"It\u0027s Dana Evans. I\u0027m in trouble. I need help.\"\n \"What\u0027s going on?\"\n Dana could hear the concern in his voice. \"I can\u0027t go into it all now, but some people are after me, trying to kill me.\"\n \"Who?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know. But it\u0027s my young son, Kemal, I\u0027m worried about. Can you help me get someone to protect him?\"\n He responded instantly. \"I\u0027ll see to it. Is he at home now?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"I\u0027ll send someone over. Now what about you? You say someone is trying to kill you?\"\n \"Yes. They\u0027ve - they\u0027ve tried twice.\"\n There was a momentary silence. \"I\u0027ll look into that and see what I can do. Where are you?\"\n \"I\u0027m at American Airlines at O\u0027Hare, and I don\u0027t know when I can get out of here.\"\n \"Stay right where you are. I\u0027ll get someone there to protect you. Meanwhile, you can stop worrying about Kemal.\"\n Dana felt a sense of deep relief. \"Thank you. Thank you.\" She hung up.\n In his office at the FRA, Jack Stone replaced the receiver. He pressed down the intercom button. \"The target just called. She\u0027s in an American Airlines terminal at O\u0027Hare. Take her.\"\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n Jack Stone turned to an aide. \"When is General Booster returning from the Far East?\"\n \"He\u0027ll be back this afternoon.\"\n \"Well, let\u0027s get the hell out of here before he finds out what\u0027s been going on.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-sky-is-falling/page-24.html","bookId":2369,"book":{"id":2369,"title":"The Sky Is Falling","description":"Storyline: \n Washington TV anchorwoman Dana Evans (from Best Laid Plans) suspects the accidents befalling the rich Winthrop family, killing all five members, were murders.
