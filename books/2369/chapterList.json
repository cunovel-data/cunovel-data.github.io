Like Chicken Little and the sky falling, she chases clues across the world to unravel an international conspiracy. The inheritance goes to charity, so money is not the motive. Her Sarajevo ward Kemal gets expelled, a prosthetic arm, then often naps afternoons under care of kindly new housekeeper.

Witnesses and informants die before, and after meetings. Friends become foes, nobody can be trusted.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-sky-is-falling.jpg","author":"Sidney Sheldon","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-sky-is-falling.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:39 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:12:54 AM"}}]
