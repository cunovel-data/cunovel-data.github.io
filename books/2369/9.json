She looked out the window and was surprised to see a moving van in front of the apartment building, with men loading furniture onto it.\n Who could be moving out? Dana wondered. Every apartment was occupied, and they were all on long-term leases.\n Dana was putting the cereal on the table when there was a knock at the door. It was Dorothy Wharton.\n \"Dana, I have some news for you,\" she said excitedly. \"Howard and I are moving to Rome today.\"\n Dana stared at her in astonishment. \"Rome? Today?\"\n \"Isn\u0027t itincredible ? Last week a man came to see Howard. It was very hush-hush. Howard told me I couldn\u0027t say anything. Well, last night the man called and offered Howard a job with his company in Italy at three times Howard\u0027s present salary.\" Dorothy was beaming.\n \"Well, that\u0027s - that\u0027s wonderful,\" Dana said. \"We\u0027re going to miss you.\"\n \"We\u0027re going to miss you, too.\"\n Howard came to the door. \"I guess Dorothy told you the news?\"\n \"Yes. I\u0027m delighted for you. But I thought you were set here for life? And suddenly - \"\n Howard just kept on talking. \"I can\u0027t believe it. Right out of the blue. It\u0027s a great company, too. Italiano Ripristino. They\u0027re one of the biggest conglomerates in Italy. They have a subsidiary that\u0027s into restoration of ruins. I don\u0027t know how they heard about me, but they flew a man all the way here just to make a deal with me. There are lots of monuments in Rome that need repairs. They\u0027re even paying the rest of our rent here for the year and we get back our deposit. The only thing is, we have to be in Rome by tomorrow. That means we have to be out of the apartment today.\"\n Dana said tentatively, \"That\u0027s very unusual, isn\u0027t it?\"\n \"I guess they\u0027re in a big hurry.\"\n \"Do you need help packing?\"\n Dorothy shook her head. \"No. We\u0027ve been up all night. Most of the stuff\u0027s going to Goodwill. On Howard\u0027s new salary, we can afford much better.\"\n Dana laughed. \"Keep in touch, Dorothy.\"\n One hour later the Whartons had left their apartment and were on their way to Rome.\n When Dana got to her office, she said to Olivia, \"Would you check out a company for me?\"\n \"Certainly.\"\n \"It\u0027s called Italiano Ripristino. I believe its headquarters are in Rome.\"\n \"Right.\"\n Thirty minutes later Olivia handed a paper to Dana. \"Here it is. It\u0027s one of the largest companies in Europe.\"\n Dana felt a sense of deep relief. \"Good. I\u0027m glad to hear that.\"\n \"By the way,\" Olivia said, \"it\u0027s not a private company.\"\n \"Oh?\"\n \"No. It\u0027s owned by the Italian government.\"\n When Dana brought Kemal home from school that afternoon, a bespectacled middle-aged man was moving into the Wharton apartment.\n Thursday, the day of Dana\u0027s appointment with Roger Hudson, started out hellishly.\n At the first television meeting, Robert Fenwick said, \"It looks like we\u0027re in trouble on tonight\u0027s broadcast.\"\n \"Give it to me,\" Dana said.\n \"You know the crew that we sent to Ireland? We were going to use their film tonight?\"\n \"Yes?\"\n \"They\u0027ve been arrested. All their equipment has been confiscated.\"\n \"Are you serious?\"\n \"I never joke about the Irish.\" He handed Dana a sheet of paper. \"Here\u0027s our lead story about the Washington banker who\u0027s being charged with fraud.\"\n \"It\u0027s a good story,\" Dana said. \"And it\u0027s our exclusive.\"\n \"Our legal department just killed it.\"\n \"What?\"\n \"They\u0027re afraid of being sued.\"\n \"Wonderful,\" Dana said bitterly.\n \"I\u0027m not through. The witness in the murder case that we scheduled for a live interview tonight - \"\n \"Yes...\"\n \"He\u0027s changed his mind. He\u0027s a no-show.\"\n Dana groaned. It was not even ten o\u0027clock in the morning. The only thing Dana had to look forward to on this day was her meeting with Roger Hudson.\n When Dana returned from the news meeting, Olivia said, \"It\u0027s eleven o\u0027clock, Miss Evans. With this weather, you probably ought to be leaving now for your appointment with Mr. Hudson.\"\n \"Thanks, Olivia. I should be back in two or three hours.\" Dana looked out the window. It was beginning to snow again. She put on her coat and scarf and started for the door. The phone rang.\n \"Miss Evans...\"\n Dana turned.\n \"There\u0027s a call for you on line three.\"\n \"Not now,\" Dana said. \"I have to go.\"\n \"It\u0027s someone from Kemal\u0027s school.\"\n \"What?\" Dana hurried back to her desk. \"Hello?\"\n \"Miss Evans?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"This is Thomas Henry.\"\n \"Yes, Mr. Henry. Is Kemal all right?\"\n \"I really don\u0027t know how to answer that. I\u0027m very sorry to tell you this, but Kemal is being expelled.\"\n Dana stood there in shock. \"Expelled. Why? What has he done?\"\n \"Perhaps we should discuss it in person. I would appreciate it if you would come and pick him up.\"\n \"Mr. Henry - \"\n \"I\u0027ll explain when you get here, Miss Evans. Thank you.\"\n Dana replaced the receiver, stunned. What could have happened?\n Olivia asked, \"Is everything all right?\"\n \"Great.\" Dana groaned. \"This makes the morning just about perfect.\"\n \"Can I do anything?\"\n \"Say an extra prayer for me.\"\n Earlier in the morning, when Dana had dropped Kemal off at school, waved good-bye, and driven away, Ricky Underwood was watching.\n As Kemal started to walk past him, Ricky said, \"Hey, it\u0027s the war hero. Your mom must be real frustrated. You only have one arm, so now when you play stinky finger with her - \"\n Kemal\u0027s movements were almost too swift to be seen. His foot slammed hard into Ricky\u0027s groin, and as Ricky screamed and started to double over, Kemal\u0027s left knee shot up and broke his nose. Blood spurted into the air.\n Kemal leaned over the moaning figure on the ground. \"Next time I\u0027ll kill you.\"\n Dana drove as fast as she could to Theodore Roosevelt Middle School, wondering what could have happened. Whatever it is, I have to talk Henry into keeping Kemal in school.\n Thomas Henry was waiting for Dana in his office. Kemal was seated in a chair opposite him. As Dana walked in, she had a sense of deja vu.\n \"Miss Evans.\"\n Dana said, \"What happened?\"\n \"Your son broke a boy\u0027s nose and cheekbone. An ambulance had to take him to the emergency room.\"\n Dana looked at him in disbelief. \"How - how could that have happened? Kemal has only one arm.\"\n \"Yes,\" Thomas Henry said tightly. \"But he has two legs. He broke the boy\u0027s nose with his knee.\"\n Kemal was studying the ceiling.\n Dana turned to him. \"Kemal, how could you do that?\"\n He looked down. \"It was easy.\"\n \"You see what I mean, Miss Evans,\" Thomas Henry said. \"His whole attitude is - I - I don\u0027t know how to describe it. I\u0027m afraid we can no longer put up with Kemal\u0027s behavior. I suggest you find a more suitable school for him.\"\n Dana said earnestly, \"Mr. Henry, Kemal doesn\u0027t pick fights. I\u0027m sure that if he got into a fight, he had a good reason for it. You can\u0027t - \"\n Mr. Henry said firmly, \"We\u0027ve made our decision, Miss Evans.\" There was finality in his tone.\n Dana took a deep breath. \"All right. We\u0027ll look for a school that\u0027s more understanding. Come on, Kemal.\"\n Kemal got up, glared at Mr. Henry, and followed Dana out of the office. They walked toward the curb in silence. Dana looked at her watch. She was now late for her appointment, and she had no place to put Kemal. I\u0027ll have to take him with me.\n When they got into the car, Dana said, \"All right, Kemal. What happened?\"\n There was no way he would ever tell her what Ricky Underwood had said. \"I\u0027m very sorry, Dana. It was my fault.\"\n Rad, Dana thought.\n The Hudson estate was nestled on five acres of ground in an exclusive area of Georgetown. The house, invisible from the street, was a three-story Georgian-style mansion on a hill. It had a white exterior and a long, sweeping driveway leading up to the front entrance.\n Dana stopped the car in front of the house. She looked at Kemal. \"You\u0027re coming in with me.\"\n \"Why?\"\n \"Because it\u0027s cold out here. Come on.\"\n Dana went to the front door and Kemal reluctantly followed her.\n Dana turned to him. \"Kemal, I\u0027m here to do a very important interview. I want you to be quiet and polite. Okay?\"\n \"Okay.\"\n Dana rang the bell. The door was opened by a pleasant-faced giant of a man in the uniform of a butler. \"Miss Evans?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"I am Cesar. Mr. Hudson is expecting you.\" He looked at Kemal, then back at Dana. \"May I have your coats?\" A moment later he was hanging them up in the front hall guest closet. Kemal kept staring up at Cesar, who towered above him.\n \"How tall are you?\"\n Dana said, \"Kemal! Don\u0027t be rude.\"\n \"Oh, it\u0027s all right, Miss Evans. I\u0027m quite used to it.\"\n \"Are you bigger than Michael Jordan?\" Kemal asked.\n \"I\u0027m afraid so.\" The butler smiled. \"I\u0027m seven feet one. Come this way, please.\"\n The entry was enormous, a long hall with a hard-wood floor, antique mirrors, and marble tables. Along the walls were shelves of precious Ming Dynasty figurines and Chihuly blown-glass statues.\n Dana and Kemal followed Cesar down the long hallway to a step-down living room, with pale yellow walls and white woodwork. The room was furnished with comfortable sofas, Queen Anne end tables, and Sheraton wing chairs covered in pale yellow silk.\n Senator Roger Hudson and his wife, Pamela, were seated at a backgammon table. They rose as Dana and Kemal were announced by Cesar.\n Roger Hudson was a stern-looking man in his late fifties, with cold gray eyes and a wary smile. There was a cautious aloofness about him.\n Pamela Hudson was a beauty, slightly younger than her husband. She seemed warm and open and down to earth. She had ash-blond hair and a trace of gray that she had not bothered to disguise.\n \"I\u0027m so sorry I\u0027m late,\" Dana apologized. \"I\u0027m Dana Evans. This is my son, Kemal.\"\n \"I\u0027m Roger Hudson. This is my wife, Pamela.\"\n Dana had looked up Roger Hudson on the Internet. His father had owned a small steel company, Hudson Industries, and Roger Hudson had built it into a worldwide conglomerate. He was a billionaire, had been the Senate majority leader, and at one time had headed the Armed Services Committee. He had retired from business and was now a political adviser to the White House. Twenty-five years earlier he had married a society beauty, Pamela Donnelly. The two of them were prominent in Washington society and influential in politics.\n Dana said, \"Kemal, this is Mr. and Mrs. Hudson.\" She looked at Roger. \"I apologize for bringing him with me, but - \"\n \"That\u0027s perfectly all right,\" Pamela Hudson said. \"We know all about Kemal.\"\n Dana looked at her in surprise. \"You do?\"\n \"Yes. A great deal has been written about you, Miss Evans. You rescued Kemal from Sarajevo. It was a wonderful thing to do.\"\n Roger Hudson stood there, silent.\n \"What can we get you?\" Pamela Hudson asked.\n \"Nothing for me, thank you,\" Dana said.\n They looked at Kemal. He shook his head.\n \"Sit down, please.\" Roger Hudson and his wife took seats on the couch. Dana and Kemal sat in the two easy chairs across from them.\n Roger Hudson said curtly, \"I\u0027m not sure why you\u0027re here, Miss Evans. Matt Baker asked me to see you. What is it I can do for you?\"\n \"I wanted to talk to you about Taylor Winthrop.\"\n Roger Hudson frowned. \"What about him?\"\n \"I understand that you knew him?\"\n \"Yes. I met Taylor when he was our ambassador to Russia. At the time, I was head of the Armed Services Committee. I went to Russia to evaluate their weapon capabilities. Taylor spent two or three days with our committee.\"\n \"What did you think of him, Mr. Hudson?\"\n There was a thoughtful pause. \"To be quite candid, Miss Evans, I was not overly impressed by all that charm. But I must say, I thought the man was very capable.\"\n Kemal, bored, looked around, got up, and wandered into the next room.\n \"Do you know if Ambassador Winthrop got in any trouble when he was in Russia?\"\n Roger Hudson gave her a puzzled look. \"I\u0027m not sure I understand. What kind of trouble?\"\n \"Something...something where he would have made enemies. I mean, really deadly enemies.\"\n Roger Hudson shook his head slowly. \"Miss Evans, if anything like that had happened, not only would I have known about it, the whole world would have known. Taylor Winthrop lived a very public life. May I ask where these questions are leading?\"\n Dana said awkwardly, \"I thought possibly Taylor Winthrop might have done something to someone that was bad enough to be a motive to want to kill him and his family.\"\n The Hudsons were both staring at her.\n Dana went on quickly. \"I know it sounds far-fetched, but so is their all dying violent deaths in less than a year.\"\n Roger Hudson said brusquely, \"Miss Evans, I\u0027ve lived long enough to know thatanything is possible, but this - what do you base it on?\"\n \"If you mean hard evidence, I have none.\"\n \"I\u0027m not surprised.\" He hesitated. \"I did hear that...\" His voice trailed off. \"Never mind.\"\n The two women were looking at him.\n Pamela said gently, \"That\u0027s not fair to Miss Evans, darling. What were you going to say?\"\n He shrugged. \"It is not important.\" He turned to Dana. \"When I was in Moscow, there was a rumor that Winthrop was involved in some type of private deal with the Russians. But I don\u0027t deal in rumors, and I\u0027m sure that you don\u0027t, Miss Evans.\" His tone was almost a reproach.\n Before Dana could respond, there was a loud crash from the adjoining library.\n Pamela Hudson rose and hurried toward the sound. Roger and Dana followed. They stopped at the door. In the library, a blue Ming vase had fallen to the floor and shattered. Kemal stood next to it.\n \"Oh, my God,\" Dana said, horrified. \"I\u0027mso sorry. Kemal, how could you - ?\"\n \"It was an accident.\"\n Dana turned to the Hudsons, her face flushed with embarrassment. \"I\u0027m terribly sorry. I\u0027ll pay for it, of course. I - \"\n \"Please don\u0027t worry about it,\" Pamela Hudson said with a nice smile. \"Our dogs do much worse.\"\n Roger Hudson\u0027s face was grim. He started to say something, but a look from his wife stopped him.\n Dana looked down at the remains of the vase. It was probably worth about ten years of my salary, she thought.\n \"Why don\u0027t we go back to the living room,\" Pamela Hudson suggested.\n Dana followed the Hudsons with Kemal at her side. \"Stay with me,\" she muttered, furious. They sat down again.\n Roger Hudson looked at Kemal. \"How did you lose your arm, son?\"\n Dana was surprised at the bluntness of the question, but Kemal answered readily.\n \"A bomb.\"\n \"I see. What about your parents, Kemal?\"\n \"They were both killed in an air raid along with my sister.\"\n Roger Hudson grunted. \"Goddamn wars.\"\n At that moment, Cesar came into the room. \"Luncheon is served.\"\n The luncheon was delicious. Dana found Pamela warm and charming and Roger Hudson withdrawn.\n \"What are you working on now?\" Pamela Hudson asked Dana.\n \"We\u0027re talking about a new show to be calledCrime Line. We\u0027re going to expose some of the people who have gotten away with committing crimes, and we\u0027ll try to help people in prison who are innocent.\"\n Roger Hudson said, \"Washington is a great place to start. It\u0027s full of holier-than-thou phonies in high places who have gotten away with every crime you can think of.\"\n \"Roger\u0027s on several government-reform committees,\" Pamela Hudson said proudly.\n \"And a lot of good it does,\" her husband grumbled. \"The difference between right and wrong seems to have gotten blurred. It should be taught at home. Our schools certainly don\u0027t teach it.\"\n Pamela Hudson looked at Dana. \"By the way, Roger and I are giving a little dinner party Saturday night. Would you be free to join us?\"\n Dana smiled. \"Why, thank you. I\u0027d love to.\"\n \"Do you have a young man?\"\n \"Yes. Jeff Connors.\"\n Roger Hudson said, \"The sports reporter on your station?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"He\u0027s not bad. I watch him sometimes,\" he said. \"I\u0027d like to meet him.\"\n Dana smiled. \"I\u0027m sure Jeff would love to come.\"\n As Dana and Kemal were leaving, Roger Hudson took Dana aside.\n \"In all candor, Miss Evans, I find your conspiracy theory about the Winthrops in the realm of fantasy. But for Matt Baker\u0027s sake, I\u0027m willing to check around and see if I can find anything that could possibly substantiate it.\"\n \"Thank you.\"\n In all candor, Miss Evans, I find your conspiracy theory about the Winthrops in the realm of fantasy. But for Matt Baker\u0027s sake, I\u0027m willing to check around and see if I can find anything that could possibly substantiate it.\n Thank you.\n Tape ends. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-sky-is-falling/page-9.html","bookId":2369,"book":{"id":2369,"title":"The Sky Is Falling","description":"Storyline: \n Washington TV anchorwoman Dana Evans (from Best Laid Plans) suspects the accidents befalling the rich Winthrop family, killing all five members, were murders.
