{"id":17389,"no":12,"title":"Chapter XII The Meeting","content":"Whenever in London my practice for years had been to put up at my friend Dixon Hubbard\u0027s rooms in Bruton Street. We had been schoolfellows. He was one of the most fortunate and unfortunate creatures in the world. Born with a silver spoon in his mouth, he had inherited from some cross-grained ancestor a biting tongue and a gloomy disposition. He was an incurable misanthrope and unpopular beyond words. At college he had been detested. Being a sickly lad, his tongue had earned him many a thrashing which he had had to endure without other reprisal than sarcasm. Yet he had never spared that. His spirit was unconquerable. I believe that he would have taunted his executioners while they burned him at the stake. I used to hate him myself once. But one day after giving him a fairly good hammering I fell so in love with the manly way in which he immediately thereafter gave me a sound excuse for wringing his neck that I begged his pardon for being a hulking bully in having lifted hand against a weaker body but a keener brain and more[Pg 112] untamable spirit than my own. That conquered him. From that moment we were inseparable chums, and on an average the privilege cost me at least two hard fights a week, for my code was—hit my chum and you hit me. His gratitude lay in jibing at me if I lost the fight, and if I won informing me that I was a fool for my pains. But we understood each other, and our friendship bravely withstood the test of time and circumstance. I found him nursing an attack of splenitic rheumatism before a fire in his study, and we were still only in the middle of July. His man, Miller, had just broken a Sévres vase, and Hubbard was telling Miller in a gentle, measured way his views of clumsiness in serving-men. Miller—a meek, dog-like creature usually—stood before his master glowing but inarticulate with rage. His fists were clenched and his lips were drawn back from his teeth. Hubbard was evidently enjoying himself. He watched the effect of his placid exhortation with a sweet smile—and he applied his mordant softly uttered gibes with the pride of a sculptor at work upon an image. Each one produced some trifling but significant change in Miller\u0027s expression. Probably Hubbard was experimenting—seeking to discover either how far he could go with safety or exactly what it would be necessary to say in order to make Miller spring at his throat. They were both so engrossed that I entered without disturbing them. I listened for a moment and then created a [Pg 113]diversion. Miller\u0027s tension was positively dangerous. I walked over, took him by the collar and propelled him from the room. \"You\u0027ll find my bag downstairs,\" I said. \"I\u0027ve come to stay.\" Miller gave me the look of a dog that wants but does not dare to lick your hand. His gratitude was pathetic. I shut the door in his face. Hubbard did not rise. He did not even offer to shake hands. He half closed his eyes and murmured in a tired voice: \"The bad penny is back again, and uglier than ever.\" I crossed the room and threw open a window. Then I marched into his bedroom, seized a water jug, returned and put out the fire. \"You\u0027ve been coddling yourself too long,\" I remarked. \"Get up and put on your hat. It\u0027s almost one. You are going to lunch with me at Verrey\u0027s.\" \"I have a stiff leg,\" he remonstrated. \"Fancy! Mere fancy,\" I returned. The room was full of steam and smoke. Hubbard said a wicked thing and got afoot, coughing. I found his hat, crammed it on his skull and crooked my arm in his. He declined to budge and wagged a blistering tongue, but I laughed and, picking him up, I carried him bodily downstairs to a cab. He called me forty sorts of cowardly bully in his gentle sweetly courteous tones, but before two blocks were passed his ill-humour had evaporated. He remembered he had news to give me. We had not met[Pg 114] for eighteen months. Of a sudden he stopped beshrewing me and leaned back in the cushions. I knew his ways and talked about the weather. He endured it until we were seated within the grill-room. Then he begged me very civilly to let God manage His own affairs. \"I am very willing,\" I said. He impaled an oyster on a fork and sniffed at it with brutal indifference to the waiter\u0027s feelings. Satisfied it was a good oyster, he swallowed it. \"I am no longer a bachelor,\" said he. \"I have taken unto myself a wife.\" \"The deuce!\" I cried. \"Exactly,\" he said. \"But the prettiest imp imaginable.\" \"My dear Hubbard, I assure you——\" \"My dear Pinsent, you have blundered on the truth.\" \"But——\" He held up a warning finger. \"It occurred a year ago. We lived together for six weeks. Then we compromised. I gave her my house in Park Lane and returned myself to Bruton Street. Pish! man, don\u0027t look so shocked. Helen and I are friends—I see her once a week now at least, sometimes more often. I assure you I enjoy her conversation. She has a natural genius for gossip and uses all her opportunities. She has already become a fixed star in the firmament of society\u0027s smartest set and aspires to found a new solar system. I allow her fifteen[Pg 115] thousand pounds a year. She spends twenty. My compensation is that I am never at a loss for a subject of reflection. We shall call on her this afternoon. A devil, but diverting. You will be amused.\" \"Do I know her, Hubbard?\" \"No; you are merely acquainted. Her maiden name was Arbuthnot.\" \"Lady Helen Arbuthnot!\" I cried. He smiled and shrugged his shoulders. \"You will find her changed. Marriage has developed her. I remember before you went away—was it to Egypt?—she tried her blandishments on you. But then she was a mere apprentice. Heaven help you now—if she marks you for her victim.\" \"Poor wretch!\" I commented. \"I suppose you can\u0027t help it. But you ought to make an effort, Hubbard, really.\" \"An effort. What for?\" \"To conceal how crudely in love with your wife you are.\" He bit his lips and frowned. \"Children and fools speak the truth,\" he murmured. Then he set to work on the champagne and drank much more than was good for him. The wine, however, only affected his appearance. It brought a flush to his pallid cheeks and made his dull eyes sparkle. He deluged me with politics till three o\u0027clock. Then we drove to Park Lane. Lady Helen kept us waiting for twenty minutes. In the meantime, two other[Pg 116] callers joined us. Men. In order to show himself at home Hubbard smoked a cigarette. The men looked pensively appalled. They were poets. They wore long hair and exotic gardens in their buttonholes. And they rolled their eyes. They must have been poets. Also they carried bouquets. Certainly they were poets. When Lady Helen entered they surged up to her, uttering little artistic foreign cries. And they kissed her hand. She gave their bouquets to the footman with an air of fascinating disdain. Their dejection was delightful. But she consoled them with a smile and advanced to us. Certainly she had changed. I had known her as a somewhat unconventional and piquant débutante. She was now a brilliant siren, an accomplished coquette and a woman of the world. Her tiny stature made her attractive, for she was perfectly proportioned and her costume ravishingly emphasised the petite and dainty grace of her figure. Her face was reminiscent of one of those wild flowers of torrid regions which resemble nothing grown in an English garden, but which, nevertheless, arrest attention and charm by their bizarrerie. It was full of eerie wisdom, subtle wilfulness and quaint, half-humorous diablerie. In one word, she was a sprite. She greeted her husband with an unctuous affectation of interest which would have made me, in his place, wish to box her ears. Hubbard, however, was as good an actor as herself. He protested he was grateful for the audience and claimed credit for [Pg 117]introducing me. Lady Helen looked me up and down and remembered that I had owed her a letter for nearly thirty-seven months. She gave me the tips of her fingers and then rushed away to kiss on both cheeks a lady who had just entered. \"Oh, you darling!\" she twittered. \"This is just too lovely of you. I have longed for you to come.\" It was May Ottley. She did not see me at once. Lady Helen utterly engrossed her. I had, therefore, time to recover from the unexpected shock of her appearance. I was ridiculously agitated. I slipped into an alcove and picked up a book of plates. At first my hands shook so that I could hardly turn the pages. Hubbard glided to my side. I felt his smile without seeing it. \"I smell a brother idiot,\" he whispered. I met his eyes and nodded. \"In Egypt, of course?\" \"Yes.\" \"She marries a guardsman next month, I hear.\" \"Indeed.\" \"The poor man,\" murmured Hubbard. \"Come out and let us drink his health.\" \"No, thank you.\" \"You\u0027d rather stay and singe your wings, poor moth.\" \"And you?\" \"Mine,\" said he, \"were amputated in St. James Church. She is a lovely creature, Pinsent.\" \"Which?\" He chuckled without replying. A footman pompously announced: \"Mrs. Carr—Lord Edward Dutton.\" \"Bring the tea, please,\" said Lady Helen\u0027s voice. \"She is staring this way at you,\" murmured Hubbard. \"She recognises your back. No, not quite, she is puzzled.\" \"She has never seen me in civilised apparel,\" I explained. \"Are you afraid of her, my boy?\" \"Yes.\" \"Well, you are honest.\" I began to listen for her voice. The air was filled with scraps of conversation. \"Three thousand, I tell you. He cannot go on like that. Shouldn\u0027t wonder if he went abroad. Like father, like son. Old Ranger had the same passion for bridge.\" \"You can say what you like, names tell one nothing. In my opinion the man is a Jew. What if he does call himself Fortescue? Consider his nose. I am tired of these rich colonials. I have no time for them. Heaven knows what they are after.\" \"She will spoil her lower register completely if she keeps on. Her voice is a mezzo and nothing else. You should have seen the way old Delman sneered when he listened to her last night.\" \"My test of a really fine soprano is the creepy feeling the high C gives one in the small of the back. Delicious. She never thrills me at all.\" \"Oh! Lord Edward, how malicious. What has the poor man done to you?\" \"He plays billiards too well to have been anything but a marker in his youth. I believe he kept a saloon somewhere in the States.\" \"They say it will end in the divorce court. That is what comes of marrying a milkmaid. And, after all, she did not present him with a son. Ah, well, it\u0027s an ill wind that blows nobody any good. Young Carnarvon is his heir still, and his chances of succeeding grow rosier every day.\" \"My dear Mrs. Belvigne, if it was not for her red hair, she would be as commonplace as—as my dear friend Mrs. Sorenson. What you men see in red hair——\" \"Conscience, Lady Helen, is a composition of indulgences. It is a marriage de convenance between the conventional instinct and the appetite.\" \"Dr. Pinsent,\" said Miss Ottley, \"is it really you?\" I turned and looked into her eyes. They were all aglow and her cheeks were suffused with colour. She gave me both her hands. The room was already crowded. People entered every minute. Hubbard pointed significantly at the tea-cups. Miss Ottley and I drifted to the divan. We watched the crowd through the parted curtains, sipping our tea. We might as well have been in a box at the theatre watching the play. \"I knew you would escape,\" she murmured,[Pg 120] presently. \"The others believe you to have perished in the desert.\" \"They consoled themselves, no doubt?\" \"My father especially.\" \"Did he recover his Arab?\" \"What Arab?\" \"The creature he had imprisoned in the sarcophagus.\" \"The mummy, you mean. The body of Pthames? Oh, yes, that was safe enough, but he was in a fearful state until we found the punt. He feared that you would either steal or destroy the mummy, I believe.\" \"Miss Ottley!\" I cried. \"You must not blame him too much,\" she murmured; \"you know how he had set heart——\" \"Look here!\" I interrupted. \"Do you mean to tell me that you found the mummy in the sarcophagus?\" \"Certainly. Why?\" \"Did you see it?\" \"Yes.\" \"The mummy?\" \"Why, of course.\" \"A dead body, a mummy?\" \"Dr. Pinsent, how strangely you insist.\" \"I\u0027ll tell you the reason. When I opened the sarcophagus——\" \"Yes.\" \"It contained not a mummy, but a living man.\" \"Impossible.\" \"You think so? The Arab was the very man who frightened you so often in the temple at the Hill of Rakh.\" \"Dr. Pinsent!\" \"When I removed the lid he leaped out of the sarcophagus, sprang ashore and fled to the desert. I followed him for several miles. But I could not catch him. I was compelled to give up the chase. And now you tell me that you afterwards found a mummy in the coffin which I had left empty.\" \"One of us is dreaming,\" said the girl. \"What was this mummy like?\" \"A tall man—with a curious conical-shaped head—and eyes set hideously far apart in its skull—but you have seen the Arab who frightened me—and indeed he attacked you at your camp. His mummified counterpart.\" \"And some of his ribs were broken?\" \"I do not know.\" \"But his body was bandaged. Otherwise he was almost nude.\" \"Good heavens!\" she exclaimed. She put down her cup. \"You make me very unhappy. You force me to recall my horror—in the cave temple. The wretched uncanny sense of the supernatural that oppressed me there. You make me remember that I was tortured into a fancy that the mummy was a ghost—that we were haunted—that—oh! oh! And father has been so kind to me lately, kinder than ever before.\" \"He is in London?\" \"Yes.\" \"And the mummy?\" \"Yes.\" \"And Dr. Belleville?\" \"He is staying with us.\" \"Captain Weldon?\" She turned aside her head. \"He is in London, too.\" \"You are shortly to be married, I am informed.\" She stood up. \"I must really be going,\" she observed constrainedly; then she held out her hand. I watched her pick her way through the crowd to our hostess. It was a well-bred crowd, but it stared at her. She was worth looking at. She walked just as a woman should and she bore herself with the proper touch of pride that is at the same time a personal protection and a provocative of curiosity. Some people call it dignity. Hubbard materialised from the shadow of a neighbouring curtain. \"My wife has invited me to dinner,\" he announced. \"You, too. I have made her your excuses because I have a money matter to discuss that should not be postponed.\" \"You have my deepest sympathy,\" I answered, and left him as puzzled to know what I meant as I was. Something was whispering over and over in my ear—\"Work! work! work!\" and whispering in the imperative mood. I determined to call upon Captain Weldon and procure from him my manuscript, at once. I remembered he lived in Jermyn Street. I walked thither as fast as I was able. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2942/80841.html","bookId":1087,"book":{"id":1087,"title":"The Living Mummy","description":"简介： I was hard at work in my tent.
