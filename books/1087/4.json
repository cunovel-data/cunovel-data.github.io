{"id":17381,"no":4,"title":"Chapter IV The Sarcophagus\u0027s Perfume","content":"Towards morning my mind grew much easier. Sir Robert awoke and took a few mouthfuls of liquid nourishment. But although too weak to speak, he was sensible and the fever had left him. He fell asleep again immediately. Soon afterwards my eyes fell on the sarcophagus. Its great size affected me with wonder—and its construction. Why should imperishable treasures, gold, silver, and precious stones be enclosed in lead? Why not in stone? And the sarcophagus had been hermetically sealed too, witness the chisel and saw marks on the lid, of Ottley\u0027s making. I examined them attentively, then sat down and stared at the sarcophagus again. It was coffin shaped. Why? If it had been intended for a mere treasure chest surely—I was struck suddenly by a fact and a remembrance. The sarcophagus manifestly measured four feet high at least. And I remembered that in filling it with water for Sir Robert\u0027s bath I had only had to fill eighteen inches in depth. What if underneath the treasure it contained another chamber overlaid with lead? There was room. I got[Pg 30] afoot and measured the depth of water on my arm. Eighteen, well, certainly not more than nineteen inches. I seized a bucket and began to bail the water out, having need to be noiseless for the sleepers\u0027 sake. The task occupied the better part of half an hour. By then morning had begun to pale the lamplight, and I was weary. But I kept on, and finally mopped the interior of the huge basin dry with a towel. Thereupon I examined the bottom with the lamp. It did not show a single crevice. The lead was in a solid and impervious sheet. Curious. But the difference between the eighteen inches and the four feet remained to be accounted for. Was the interspace filled with lead? If so—why such uneconomic expenditure of a valuable mineral? The mystery interested me so much that my weariness was forgotten. I felt that at any cost it must be solved forthwith. Casting about, I found a fine-pointed and razor-sharp chisel in the drawer of Sir Robert Ottley\u0027s camp table. With this, I set to work. Climbing into the sarcophagus, I selected a spot, and using the weight of my body in place of a hammer, I forced the chisel into the lead. It bit into the metal slowly but surely. One inch. One inch and a half. Suddenly it slipped. I fell forward and was brought up by the handle. The mystery was solved. I recovered my position and wiped my forehead. Instantly a thin but strangely overpowering perfume filled my nostrils. It resembled camphor, and violets, and lavender, and[Pg 31] oil of almonds, and a hundred other scents, but was truly like none of them. It created and compelled, however, a confused train of untranslatable reflections which might have been memories. But God knows what they were. I experienced a mysterious sensation of immeasurable antiquity. And wildly absurd as the idea appears set forth in sober language, something assured me that I was thousands of years old or had lived before—so long—so very long ago. I saw lights—the sound of chanting voices and of rushing waters filled my ears. I seemed to be assisting at a solemn ritual. Ghostly forces and dim spirit figures filled the cave. The air was thick with incense fumes. My reason rocked and swung. Just in time I realised that I was becoming mysteriously an?sthetised. I held my breath and with a powerful effort leaped to the floor. Then I carefully blocked up the chisel hole with my kerchief and staggered into the open air. Very soon I was my own man again. Returning filled with apprehension for the patient, I found nothing to alarm me. The perfume had absolutely disappeared. Sir Robert was sleeping like a babe. I took a nip of brandy and sitting down, gave myself to dreams watching the sarcophagus. What was its secret? And what the secret of Sir Robert Ottley\u0027s passionate interest in the corpse of Ptahmes that had been potent enough to call him back to life from the very brink of dissolution? But plainly I must wait to learn. For it would not do to trifle[Pg 32] with the perfume in the cavern. In that confined space it might bring about the destruction of us all. Already it had affected me. My head ached fearfully, and I knew that my blood vessels were distended, and that my heart was still violently excited. My agitation was not all painful. There was an insidious pleasure mingled with it, an intangible titillation of the nerves; but that only alarmed me the more. The poisons that are most to be feared are those which captivate the senses; they convey no warning to the body, and betray the mind, however watchful, by effecting a paralysis of will. Perhaps—unwittingly—I had been very near death. The notion was disturbing. I began to regard the sarcophagus much in the light of an infernal machine possessing dangerous potentialities for ill. I determined as soon as possible—that is to say, as soon as help arrived—to have it removed from the sick room to the pylon. There at least it would be less manifestly perilous; having the play of the whole wide desert atmosphere in which to dissipate its noxious energies. A rustling sound dissolved my meditations. I glanced up and saw Miss Ottley bending over her father. I slipped out and sought the Arab\u0027s quarters. Soon I had a good fire alight and water on to boil. I rather spread myself that morning. I cooked some tinned asparagus, boiled a tinned chicken, and opened a jar of prunes. Breakfast spread on the lid of a brandy box looked and smelled[Pg 33] very good. I carried it up to the pylon and whistled \"Come into the garden, Maude.\" Miss Ottley appeared at once, round eyed with surprise. \"Your father has already eaten,\" I observed. \"In all likelihood he will sleep for hours yet. Kindly sit down. You\u0027ll excuse my novel breakfast call. It is the only invitational air I am acquainted with.\" She stared at me. \"May one not be lighthearted when all goes well?\" I asked. \"One may,\" she answered. Then her eyes fell and she coloured painfully. \"But not two. I slept at my post. Oh! how could I?\" Her voice was quite despairing and bitterly contemptuous. I bit at the leg of a chicken which I held in my fingers. \"After all, you are a woman, you know,\" I commented, with my mouth full. \"This chick\u0027s prime—done to a turn.\" \"How tired you must be!\" \"I\u0027m not complaining. Nor do I grudge you the extra rest. You look better. Hungry?\" \"Y-yes,\" she admitted. \"Then don\u0027t be a ninny spending time in vain regrets. Fall to and repair your waste tissues. In plain English—eat.\" She sat down on a ruined column and I handed her a plate. \"You look—positively merry!\" she said. \"You[Pg 34] are nursing some—pleasant—or profitable reflection.\" She considered the words with care. \"I have discovered that I may have—told the truth to your father last night after all. By accident.\" \"I beg your pardon.\" \"I believe I have found your friend Ptahmes, Miss Ottley.\" The plate slid off her lap and broke. Chicken and gravy littered the pavement. But she had no idea of it. \"Impossible!\" she cried. I explained my examination of the sarcophagus and the result in detail. She sat gazing at me like a graven image. When she had finished she arose and vanished—without a word. I followed and found her standing beside the great lead coffin, my kerchief in her hand. She had reopened the chisel hole, and the cavern was already saturated with the infernal gas. I snatched my handkerchief away and once more blocked the vent. Then I exerted all my strength and with a prodigious effort placed the lid on the sarcophagus. With a woman\u0027s curiosity to reckon with, such a precaution seemed a vital safeguard. I found her standing in the pylon, breathing like a spent runner. \"You might have taken my word,\" I said coldly. \"You\u0027d have saved yourself an ugly headache at the least.\" Her face was crimson; her eyes burned like stars. The fumes of that uncanny perfume had made her[Pg 35] drunk. She swayed and leaned dizzily against a pillar. I went up and took her hand. The pulse was beating like a miniature steam hammer. \"Sit down,\" I said. She laughed and sank at my feet in a heap. \"Oh! Oh!\" she cried and fell to sobbing half hysterically though tearlessly. \"Lord!\" I said aloud. \"What a bundle of hysterical humours it is, and how plain to look on when its resolution takes a holiday.\" That is the way to treat hysteria. Miss Ottley sat up and withered me with a glance. \"I—I am. It—it\u0027s not hysteria,\" she stammered, between gasps. \"Besides—you—confessed—it—overcame—you, too.\" Then she fainted. I sprang up, but even as I moved I heard a loud sigh in the cavern. \"The sick man first,\" I muttered, and let the girl lie. But at the door of the cavern chamber I stood transfixed. A dark shape bent over the patient\u0027s cot, hiding Sir Robert Ottley\u0027s face from view. It seemed to be a man, but its back was presented to my gaze. \"What the deuce are you doing here, whoever you are?\" I cried out, and started forward. The shape melted on the instant into thinnest air. \"Nothing but a shadow,\" I said to myself. It was necessary to say something. I was shocked to my soul. I stood for a moment shaking and dismayed. The shadow had been so thick and bodily and had fled so like a spirit that I had work[Pg 36] to do to readjust my scattered faculties. Of course a shadow—and my eyes, dazzled by the sunlight without, had momentarily failed to pierce it. A reasonable and quite ample scientific explanation. But what had cast the shadow? Pish—what but myself? And yet: and yet: I was shivering like a blancmange. Never had my nerves used me so ill. Perhaps, however, that accursed perfume had affected them. Ah! there was a reassuring solution of the puzzle. Reassuring to my reason, be it understood, for the fleshy part of me was taken with an ague and refused for many seconds to return to its subjection to my will. Sometimes now I doubt but that the flesh has an intelligence apart from the brain cells and nerve structures that usually control it. Indeed, I have never met a man of intellect whose memory does not register experience of some occasion in which his flesh took independent fright—like a startled hare—at some bogie which made his sober reason subsequently smile; nay, contemptuously at times. \"Well, well,\" I said at length and pushed forward—to receive another shock. Sir Robert Ottley was almost nude. The bed clothes had been pushed down past his waist. His fingers convulsively gripped the paillasse. His face was livid. His eyes were open and upturned. His whole form was stiff and rigid. A fit? It seemed so. His pulse was still. He did not breathe. But a cataleptic fit then, for at a lance prick the blood flowed. I forced him to his right[Pg 37] side and tried massage. No use. Strychnine and nitro-glycerine equally refused to act. Finally I saturated a cloth with amyl nitrate, placed it over his open mouth and tried artificial respiration. A whole hour had passed already, but I refused to give in. It was well. In another twenty minutes my efforts were rewarded with a sigh. I kept on and the man began to breathe. When it seemed safe to leave off, I disposed him easily and watched events. First his normal colouring returned. Then his mouth closed. Finally his eyes revolved. The lids closed and opened several times, then rested closed. His pulse beat feverishly, but in spite of that he slept. I walked to the door. Miss Ottley—whom I had completely forgotten—still lay insensible where she had fallen. I picked her up and brought her into the cavern. She awoke to consciousness in transit. I forced her to drink a stiff nobbler of brandy, and very soon she was in her old, cold, bright, proud, self-reliant state—armed cap-a-pie with insolence and egotism. \"Is your father subject to fits?\" I asked. \"He has never had, till this, a day\u0027s illness in his life,\" she responded—with a touch of indignation. I nodded. \"Well, his period of disease indemnity has passed. While you swooned he had a fit. I use the expression colloquially. You would probably have so described his condition had you seen him. As for me I don\u0027t know. The symptoms were unique. I restored him by treating him as[Pg 38] a drowned man. He was in a sort of trance. From this moment he must never be left, even for a second.\" \"He was insensible?\" \"He was inanimate.\" \"That perfume!\" she cried. I shrugged my shoulders. \"No doubt.\" We glanced at the sarcophagus, then at each other. \"Was there need?\" she asked, colouring. Then her eyes sparkled. \"Oh, for such strength!\" she cried. \"It took six Arabs to lift that coffin lid. You must be a Samson.\" \"Fortunately,\" I observed. Her brows drew together and her lips. \"You treat me in a way that I resent,\" she said. \"I am as reasonable a being as yourself.\" I retired to a corner and stretched myself upon the floor without replying. \"When do you wish to be aroused?\" she asked. \"An hour before sunset. We must eat—that is I. You appear to thrive on air.\" She bit her lips and I stared at the ceiling. I was dog-tired, but could not sleep. I counted a thousand and then glanced at Miss Ottley. Her gaze was fixed on me. \"You are overtired,\" she said, and her tone was pure womanly. It irritated and amused me to find she could so unaffectedly assume it. I smiled. [Pg 39] She interpreted the smile aloud. \"What sound reason have you for despising me?\" she asked. \"You pretend to be a scientist. Answer me as such, rejecting bias.\" \"I don\u0027t,\" said I. \"Then you dislike me; why?\" \"I don\u0027t.\" Her lip curled. \"Oh, indeed.\" She arose and brought me a cushion. I took it and our hands touched. \"I must conclude, then, that you like me?\" She drew her hand swiftly away and returned to her seat. I smiled again. \"Undoubtedly, Miss Ottley.\" \"Thank you.\" The tone was instinct with sarcasm. \"Confess that you are craving for a little human sympathy.\" \"I!\" she exclaimed and started haughtily. \"Being a woman and in a simply damnable position.\" \"Ah!\" she cried, \"you admit that.\" \"My dear girl, whenever I think of it your pluck amazes me.\" To my astonishment her eyes closed and her bosom heaved. Then I saw such a struggle as I do not wish ever to witness again. Pride prevented her from raising her hand to hide her face. And pride put up a superhuman fight with human weakness. Her features were distorted. One could see that soul and body were engaged in mortal[Pg 40] combat. That spectacle was poignantly fascinating. I thrilled to see it and yet hated myself for not being able to look away. Why—who knows? But at length I could stand it no longer. I got up and shook her gently. She stiffened into marble, but did not offer to resist me. \"Peace, peace,\" I said. \"You foolish, foolish child, you are wasting forces that were given you for quite another purpose.\" Suddenly her eyes opened and looked straight in mine. \"What?\" she questioned, and two great tears rolled down her cheeks. \"Why do you hate your sex?\" I asked. \"God knows it is more valuable than mine.\" \"Man,\" she muttered—and shuddered from me—bitterly defiant. \"Woman,\" I retorted. \"And each of us with a fateful mission to fulfil, not to fight against.\" \"Yours to sting, to hurt, to crush.\" \"And yours to foster and create a better, finer-natured breed.\" \"Generous?\" she sneered. \"Is it possible?\" \"My dear girl,\" said I, \"I haven\u0027t a temper to lose; I am a sober, cold-blooded man of the world. Of thirty.\" I laughed out heartily, then stopped, remembering the patient. He stirred and we both hurried to his side. But he did not wake. I looked up and offered Miss Ottley my right hand. \"We started badly,\" I whispered, \"but still we may be friends.\" Her eyes darkened with anger. She stood like a statue regarding me, her expression sphinx-like and brooding. \"Instinct says one thing and pride another!\" I hazarded. She coloured to her chin, but her firm glance did not falter. \"Ah, well,\" said I, and made off to my stone couch, convinced that a man who argues with a woman is a fool. And I was punished properly. She haunted my dreams. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2942/80833.html","bookId":1087,"book":{"id":1087,"title":"The Living Mummy","description":"简介： I was hard at work in my tent.
