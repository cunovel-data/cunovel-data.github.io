{"id":16711,"no":11,"title":"Chapter 11 Interrogations","content":"CNN broke the story first.\n 　　I was glad it hit the news before I had to leave for school, anxious to hear how thehumans would phrase the account, and what amount of attention it would garner.\n 　　Luckily, it was a heavy news day. There was an earthquake in South America and apolitical kidnapping in the Middle East. So it ended up only earning a few seconds, \n a fewsentences, and one grainy picture.\n 　　“Alonzo Calderas Wallace, suspected serial rapist and murderer wanted in thestates of Texas and Oklahoma, was apprehended last night in Portland, Oregon thanks \n toan anonymous tip. Wallace was found unconscious in an alley early this morning, just afew yards from a police station. Officials are unable to tell us at this time \n whether he willbe extradited to Houston or Oklahoma City to stand trial.”\n 　　The picture was unclear, a mug shot, and he’d had a thick beard at the time of thephotograph. Even if Bella saw it, she would probably not recognize him. I hoped \n shewouldn’t; it would make her afraid needlessly.\n 　　“The coverage here in town will be light. It’s too far away to be considered oflocal interest,” Alice told me. “It was a good call to have Carlisle take him out \n of state.”\n 　　I nodded. Bella didn’t watch much TV regardless, and I’d never seen her fatherwatching anything besides sports channels.\n 　　I’d done what I could. This monster no longer hunted, and I was not a murderer.\n 　　Not recently, anyway. I’d been right to trust Carlisle, as much as I still wished themonster had not gotten off quite so easily. I caught myself hoping he would be \n extraditedto Texas, where the death penalty was so popular…No. That didn’t matter. I would put this behind me, and concentrate on what wasmost important.\n 　　I’d left Bella’s room less than an hour ago. I was already aching to see her again.\n 　　“Alice, do you mind—”\n 　　She cut me off. “Rosalie will drive. She’ll act pissed, but you know she’ll enjoythe excuse to show off her car.” Alice trilled a laugh.\n 　　 I grinned at her. “See you at school.”\n 　　Alice sighed, and my grin became a grimace.\n 　　I know, I know, she thought. Not yet. I’ll wait until you’re ready for Bella toknow me. You should know, though, this isn’t just me being selfish. Bella’s going \n to likeme, too.\n 　　I didn’t answer her as I hurried out the door. That was a different way of viewingthe situation. Would Bella want to know Alice? To have a vampire for a \n girlfriend?\n 　　Knowing Bella…that idea probably wouldn’t bother her in the slightest.\n 　　I frowned to myself. What Bella wanted and what was best for Bella were twovery separate things.\n 　　I started to feel uneasy as I parked my car in Bella’s driveway. The human adagesaid that things looked different in the morning—that things changed when you \n slept onthem. Would I look different to Bella in the weak light of a foggy day? More sinister orless sinister than I had in the blackness of night? Had the truth sunk \n in while she slept?\n 　　Would she finally be afraid?\n 　　Her dreams had been peaceful, though, last night. When she’d spoken my name,time and time again, she’d smiled. More than once she’d murmured a plea for me to \n stay.\n 　　Would that mean nothing today?\n 　　I waited nervously, listening to the sounds of her inside the house—the fast,stumbling footsteps on the stairs, the sharp rip of a foil wrapper, the contents of \n therefrigerator crashing against each other when the door slammed. It sounded like she wasin a hurry. Anxious to get to school? The thought made me smile, hopeful \n again.\n 　　I looked at the clock. I supposed that—taking in account the velocity her decrepittruck must limit her to—she was running a little late.\n 　　Bella rushed out of the house, her book bag sliding off her shoulder, her haircoiled into a messy twist that was already coming apart on the nape of her neck. \n Thethick green sweater she wore was not enough to keep her thin shoulders from hunchingagainst the cold fog.\n 　　The long sweater was too big for her, unflattering. It masked her slender figure,turning all her delicate curves and soft lines into a shapeless jumble. I \n appreciated thisalmost as much as I wished that she had worn something more like the soft blue blouse she’d worn last night…the fabric had clung to her skin in such \n an appealing way, cut lowenough to reveal the mesmerizing way her collar bones curled away from the hollowbeneath her throat. The blue had flowed like water along the \n subtle shape of her body…It was better—essential—that I kept my thoughts far, far away from that shape, soI was grateful to the unbecoming sweater she wore. I couldn\n ’t afford to make mistakes,and it would be a monumental mistake to dwell on the strange hungers that thoughts ofher lips…her skin…her body…were shaking loose inside \n of me. Hungers that hadevaded me for a hundred years. But I could not allow myself to think of touching her,because that was impossible.\n 　　I would break her.\n 　　Bella turned away from the door, in such a hurry that she nearly ran right by mycar without noticing it.\n 　　Then she skidded to a stop, her knees locking like a startled colt’s. Her bag slidfurther down her arm, and her eyes flew wide as they focused on the car.\n 　　I got out, taking no care to move at human speed, and opened the passenger doorfor her. I would not try to deceive her anymore—when we were alone, at least, I \n wouldbe myself.\n 　　She looked up at me, startled again as I seemingly materialized out of the fog.\n 　　And then the surprise in her eyes changed to something else, and I was no longer afraid—or hopeful—that her feelings for me had changed in the course of the \n night. Warmth,wonder, fascination, all swimming in the melted chocolate of her eyes.\n 　　“Do you want to ride with me today?” I asked. Unlike dinner last night, I wouldlet her choose. From now on, it must always be her choice.\n 　　“Yes, thank you,” she murmured, climbing into my car without hesitation.\n 　　Would it ever cease to thrill me, that I was the one she was saying yes to? Idoubted it.\n 　　I flashed around the car, eager to join her. She showed no sign of being shockedby my sudden reappearance.\n 　　The happiness I felt when she sat beside me this way had no precedent. As muchas I enjoyed the love and companionship of my family, despite the various \n entertainmentsand distractions the world had to offer, I had never been happy like this. Even knowing that it was wrong, that this couldn’t possibly end well, could \n not keep the smile from myface for long.\n 　　My jacket was folded over the headrest of her seat. I saw her eyeing it.\n 　　“I brought the jacket for you,” I told her. This was my excuse, had I needed toprovide one, for showing up uninvited this morning. It was cold. She had no jacket.\n 　　Surely this was an acceptable form of chivalry. “I didn’t want you to get sick orsomething.”\n 　　“I’m not quite that delicate,” she said, staring at my chest rather than my face, asif she were hesitant to meet my eyes. But she put the coat on before I had to \n resort tocommanding or coaxing.\n 　　“Aren’t you?” I muttered to myself.\n 　　She stared out at the road as I accelerated toward the school. I could only standthe silence for a few seconds. I had to know what her thoughts were this morning. \n Somuch had changed between us since the last time the sun was up.\n 　　“What, no twenty questions today?” I asked, keeping it light again.\n 　　She smiled, seeming glad that I’d broached the subject. “Do my questions botheryou?”\n 　　“Not as much as your reactions do,” I told her honestly, smiling in response to hersmile.\n 　　Her mouth turned down. “Do I react badly?”\n 　　“No, that’s the problem. You take everything so coolly—it’s unnatural.” Not onescream so far. How could that be? “It makes me wonder what you’re really \n thinking.”\n 　　Of course, everything she did or didn’t do made me wonder that.\n 　　“I always tell you what I’m really thinking.”\n 　　“You edit.”\n 　　Her teeth pressed into her lip again. She didn’t seem to notice when she didthis—it was an unconscious response to tension. “Not very much.”\n 　　Just those words were enough to have my curiosity raging. What did shepurposefully keep from me?\n 　　“Enough to drive me insane,” I said.\n 　　She hesitated, and then whispered, “You don’t want to hear it.”\n 　　 I had to think for a moment, run through our entire conversation last night, wordfor word, before I made the connection. Perhaps it took so much concentration \n because Icouldn’t imagine anything that I wouldn’t want her to say to me. And then—because thetone of her voice was the same as last night; there was suddenly pain \n there again—Iremembered. Once, I had asked her not to speak her thoughts. Never say that, I’d all butsnarled at her. I had made her cry…Was this what she kept from \n me? The depth of her feelings about me? That mybeing a monster didn’t matter to her, and that she thought it was too late for her to changeher mind?\n 　　I was unable to speak, because the joy and pain were too strong for words, theconflict between them too wild to allow for a coherent response. It was silent in the \n carexcept for the steady rhythms of her heart and lungs.\n 　　“Where’s the rest of your family?” she asked suddenly.\n 　　I took a deep breath—registering the scent in the car with true pain for the firsttime; I was getting used to this, I realized with satisfaction—and forced myself \n to becasual again.\n 　　“They took Rosalie’s car.” I parked in the open spot next to the car in question. Ihid my smile as I watched her eyes widen. “Ostentatious, isn’t it?”\n 　　“Um, wow. If she has that, why does she ride with you?”\n 　　Rosalie would have enjoyed Bella’s reaction…if she were being objective aboutBella, which probably wouldn’t happen.\n 　　“Like I said, it’s ostentatious. We try to blend in.”\n 　　“You don’t succeed,” she told me, and then she laughed a carefree laugh.\n 　　The blithe, wholly untroubled sound of her laughter warmed my hollow chesteven as it made my head swim with doubt.\n 　　“So why did Rosalie drive today if it’s more conspicuous?” she wondered.\n 　　“Hadn’t you noticed? I’m breaking all the rules now.”\n 　　My answer should have been mildly frightening—so, of course, Bella smiled at it.\n 　　She didn’t wait for me to open her door, just like last night. I had to feignnormality here at school—so I couldn’t move fast enough to prevent this—but she \n wasjust going to have to get used to being treated with more courtesy, and get used to it soon.\n 　　 I walked as close to her as I dared, watching carefully for any sign that myproximity upset her. Twice her hand twitched toward me and then she would snatch \n itback. It looked like she wanted to touch me… My breath sped.\n 　　“Why do you have cars like that at all? If you’re looking for privacy?” she askedas we walked.\n 　　“An indulgence,” I admitted. “We all like to drive fast.”\n 　　“Figures,” she mumbled, her tone sour.\n 　　She didn’t look up to see my answering grin.\n 　　Nuh-uh! I don’t believe this! How the hell did Bella pull this off? I don’t get it!\n 　　Why?\n 　　Jessica’s mental boggling interrupted my thoughts. She was waiting for Bella,taking refuge from the rain under the edge of the cafeteria’s roof, with Bella’s \n winterjacket over her arm. Her eyes were wide with disbelief.\n 　　Bella noticed her, too, in the next moment. A faint pink touched her cheek whenBella registered Jessica’s expression. The thoughts in Jessica’s head were fairly \n clear onher face.\n 　　“Hey, Jessica. Thanks for remembering,” Bella greeted her. She reached out forthe jacket and Jessica handed it to her wordlessly.\n 　　I should be polite to Bella’s friends, whether they were good friends or not.\n 　　“Good morning, Jessica.”\n 　　Whoa…Jessica’s eyes popped even wider. It was strange and amusing…and, honestly, abit embarrassing…to realize how much being near Bella had softened me. It \n seemed likeno one was afraid of me any more. If Emmett found out about this, he would be laughingfor the next century.\n 　　“Er…hi,” Jessica mumbled, and her eyes flashed to Bella’s face, full ofsignificance. “I guess I’ll see you in Trig.”\n 　　You are so going to spill. I’m not taking no for an answer. Details. I have tohave details! Edward freaking CULLEN!! Life is so unfair.\n 　　Bella’s mouth twitched. “Yeah, I’ll see you then.”\n 　　 Jessica’s thoughts ran wild as she hurried to her first class, peeking back at usnow and then.\n 　　The whole story. I’m not accepting anything less. Did they plan to meet up lastnight? Are they dating? How long? How could she keep this a secret? Why would \n shewant to? It can’t be a casual thing—she has to be seriously into him. Is there any otheroption? I will find out. I can’t stand not knowing. I wonder if she’s \n made out with him?\n 　　Oh, swoon… Jessica’s thoughts were suddenly disjointed, and she let wordless fantasiesswirl through her head. I winced at her speculations, and not just because \n she’d replacedBella with herself in the mental pictures.\n 　　It couldn’t be like that. And yet I…I wanted…I resisted making the admission, even to myself. How many wrong ways would Iwant Bella in? Which one would end up \n killing her?\n 　　I shook my head, and tried to lighten up.\n 　　“What are you going to tell her?” I asked Bella.\n 　　“Hey!” she whispered fiercely. “I thought you couldn’t read my mind!”\n 　　“I can’t.” I stared at her, surprised, trying to make sense of her words. Ah—wemust have been thinking the same thing at the same time. Hmm…I rather liked \n that.\n 　　“However,” I told her, “I can read hers—she’ll be waiting to ambush you in class.”\n 　　Bella groaned, and then let the jacket slide off her shoulders. I didn’t realize thatshe was giving it back at first—I wouldn’t have asked for it; I would rather \n she kept it…atoken—so I was too slow to offer her my help. She handed me the jacket, and put herarms through her own, without looking up to see that my hands were \n extended to assist. Ifrowned at that, and then controlled my expression before she noticed it.\n 　　“So, what are you going to tell her?” I pressed.\n 　　“A little help? What does she want to know?”\n 　　I smiled, and shook my head. I wanted to hear what she was thinking without aprompt. “That’s not fair.”\n 　　Her eyes tightened. “No, you not sharing what you know—now that’s unfair.”\n 　　Right—she didn’t like double standards.\n 　　 We got to the door of her class—where I would have to leave her; I wondered idlyif Ms. Cope would be more accommodating about a switch in the schedule of my \n Englishclass… I made myself focus. I could be fair.\n 　　“She wants to know if we’re secretly dating,” I said slowly. “And she wants toknow how you feel about me.”\n 　　Her eyes were wide—not startled, but ingenious now. They were open to me,readable. She was playing innocent.\n 　　“Yikes,” she murmured. “What should I say?”\n 　　“Hmmm.” She always tried to make me give away more than she did. I ponderedhow to respond.\n 　　A wayward strand of her hair, slightly damp from the fog, draped across hershoulder and curled around where her collar bone was hidden by the ridiculous sweater.\n 　　It drew my eyes…pulled them across the other hidden lines…I reached for it carefully, not touching her skin—the morning was chill enoughwithout my touch—and \n twisted it back into place in her untidy bun so that it wouldn’tdistract me again. I remembered when Mike Newton had touched her hair, and my jawflexed at the memory. \n She had flinched away from him then. Her reaction now wasnothing the same; instead, there was a slight widening of her eyes, a rush of blood underher skin, and a \n sudden, uneven thumping of her heart.\n 　　I tried to hide my smile as I answered her question.\n 　　“I suppose you could say yes to the first…if you don’t mind—,” her choice,always her choice, “—it’s easier than any other explanation.”\n 　　“I don’t mind,” she whispered. Her heart had not found its normal rhythm yet.\n 　　“And as for her other question…” I couldn’t hide my smile now. “Well, I’ll belistening to hear the answer to that one myself.”\n 　　Let Bella consider that. I held back my laugh as shock crossed her face.\n 　　I turned quickly, before she could ask for any more answers. I had a difficult timenot giving her whatever she asked for. And I wanted to hear her thoughts, not \n mine.\n 　　“I’ll see you at lunch,” I called back to her over my shoulder, an excuse to checkthat she was still staring after me, wide-eyed. Her mouth was hanging open. I \n turnedaway again, and laughed.\n 　　 As I paced away, I was vaguely aware of the shocked and speculative thoughtsthat swirled around me—eyes bouncing back and forth between Bella’s face and \n myretreating figure. I paid them little attention. I couldn’t concentrate. It was hard enoughto keep my feet moving at an acceptable speed as I crossed the soggy grass \n to my nextclass. I wanted to run—really run, so fast that I would disappear, so fast that it wouldfeel like I was flying. Part of me was flying already.\n 　　I put the jacket on when I got to class, letting her fragrance swim thick around me.\n 　　I would burn now—let the scent desensitize me—and then it would be easier to ignore itlater, when I was with her again at lunch…It was a good thing that my \n teachers no longer bothered to call on me. Todaymight have been the day that they would have caught me out, unprepared and answerless.\n 　　My mind was in so many places this morning; only my body was in the classroom.\n 　　Of course I was watching Bella. That was becoming natural—as automatic asbreathing. I heard her conversation with a demoralized Mike Newton. She quicklydirected \n the conversation to Jessica, and I grinned so wide that Rob Sawyer, who sat atthe desk to my right, flinched visibly and slid deeper into his seat, away from me.\n 　　Ugh. Creepy.\n 　　Well, I hadn’t lost it entirely.\n 　　I was also monitoring Jessica loosely, watching her refine her questions for Bella.\n 　　I could barely wait for fourth period, ten times as eager and anxious as the curious humangirl who wanted fresh gossip.\n 　　And I was also listening to Angela Weber.\n 　　I had not forgotten the gratitude I felt to her—for thinking nothing but kind thingstoward Bella in the first place, and then for her help last night. So I waited \n through themorning, looking for something that she wanted. I assumed it would be an easy; like anyother human, there must be some bauble or toy she wanted particularly. \n Several,probably. I would deliver something anonymously and call us even.\n 　　But Angela proved almost as unaccommodating as Bella with her thoughts. Shewas oddly content for a teenager. Happy. Perhaps this was the reason for her \n unusualkindness—she was one of those rare people who had what they wanted and wanted whatthey had. If she wasn’t paying attention to her teachers and her notes, she \n was thinking of the twin little brothers she was taking to the beach this weekend—anticipating theirexcitement with an almost maternal pleasure. She cared for them \n often, but was notresentful of this fact… It was very sweet.\n 　　But not really helpful to me.\n 　　There had to be something she wanted. I would just have to keep looking. Butlater. It was time for Bella’s trig class with Jessica.\n 　　I wasn’t watching where I was going as I made my way to English. Jessica wasalready in her seat, both her feet tapping impatiently against the floor as she waited \n forBella to arrive.\n 　　Conversely, once I settled into my assigned seat in the classroom, I becameutterly still. I had to remind myself to fidget now and then. To keep up the charade. \n Itwas difficult, my thoughts were so focused on Jessica’s. I hoped she would pay attention,really try to read Bella’s face for me.\n 　　Jessica’s tapping intensified when Bella walked into the room.\n 　　She looks…glum. Why? Maybe there’s nothing going on with Edward Cullen.\n 　　That would be a disappointment. Except…then he’s still available… If he’s suddenlyinterested in dating, I don’t mind helping out with that…Bella’s face didn\n ’t look glum, it looked reluctant. She was worried—she knew Iwould hear all of this. I smiled to myself.\n 　　“Tell me everything!” Jess demanded while Bella was still removing her jacket tohang it on the back of her seat. She was moving with deliberation, unwilling.\n 　　Ugh, she’s so slow. Let’s get to the juicy stuff!\n 　　“What do you want to know?” Bella stalled as she took her seat.\n 　　“What happened last night?”\n 　　“He bought me dinner, and then he drove me home.”\n 　　And then? C’mon, there has to be more than that! She’s lying anyway, I knowthat. I’m going to call her on it.\n 　　“How did you get home so fast?”\n 　　I watched Bella roll her eyes at the suspicious Jessica.\n 　　“He drives like a maniac. It was terrifying.”\n 　　 She smiled a tiny smile, and I laughed out loud, interrupting Mr. Mason’sannouncements. I tried to turn the laugh into a cough, but no one was fooled. Mr. \n Masonshot me an irritated look, but I didn’t even bother to listen to the thought behind it. I washearing Jessica.\n 　　Huh. She sounds like she’s telling the truth. Why is she making me pull this outof her, word by word? I would be bragging at the top of my lungs if it were me.\n 　　“Was it like a date—did you tell him to meet you there?”\n 　　Jessica watched surprise cross Bella’s expression, and was disappointed at howgenuine it seemed.\n 　　“No—I was very surprised to see him there,” Bella told her.\n 　　What is going on?? “But he picked you up for school today?” There has to bemore to the story.\n 　　“Yes—that was a surprise, too. He noticed I didn’t have a jacket last night.”\n 　　That’s not very much fun, Jessica thought, disappointed again.\n 　　I was tired of her line of questioning—I wanted to hear something I didn’t alreadyknow. I hoped she wasn’t so dissatisfied that she would skip the questions I \n was waitingfor.\n 　　“So are you going out again?” Jessica demanded.\n 　　“He offered to drive me to Seattle Saturday because he thinks my truck isn’t up toit—does that count?”\n 　　Hmm. He sure is going out of his way to…well, take care of her, sort of. Theremust be something there on his side, if not on hers. How could THAT be? Bella’s \n crazy.\n 　　“Yes,” Jessica answered Bella’s question.\n 　　“Well, then,” Bella concluded. “Yes.”\n 　　“Wow…Edward Cullen.” Whether she likes him or not, this is major.\n 　　“I know,” Bella sighed.\n 　　The tone of her voice encouraged Jessica. Finally—she sounds like she gets it!\n 　　She must realize…“Wait!” Jessica said, suddenly remembering her most vital question. “Has hekissed you?” Please say yes. And then describe every second!\n 　　 “No,” Bella mumbled, and then she looked down at her hands, her face falling.\n 　　“It’s not like that.”\n 　　Damn. I wish… Ha. Looks like she does to.\n 　　I frowned. Bella did look upset about something, but it couldn’t bedisappointment like Jessica assumed. She couldn’t want that. Not knowing what sheknew. She \n couldn’t want to be that close to my teeth. For all she knew, I had fangs.\n 　　I shuddered.\n 　　“Do you think Saturday…?” Jessica prodded.\n 　　Bella looked even more frustrated as she said, “I really doubt it.”\n 　　Yeah, she does wish. That sucks for her.\n 　　Was it because I was watching all this through the filter of Jessica’s perceptionsthat it seemed like Jessica was right?\n 　　For a half-second I was distracted by the idea, the impossibility, of what it wouldbe like to try to kiss her. My lips to her lips, cold stone to warm, yielding \n silk…And then she dies.\n 　　I shook my head, wincing, and made myself pay attention.\n 　　“What did you talk about?” Did you talk to him, or did you make him drag everyounce of information out of you like this?\n 　　I smiled ruefully. Jessica wasn’t far off.\n 　　“I don’t know, Jess, lots of stuff. We talked about the English essay a little.”\n 　　A very little. I smiled wider.\n 　　Oh, c’MON. “Please, Bella! Give me some details.”\n 　　Bella deliberated for a moment.\n 　　“Well…okay, I’ve got one. You should have seen the waitress flirting with him—it was over the top. But he didn’t pay any attention to her at all.”\n 　　What a strange detail to share. I was surprised Bella had even noticed. It seemeda very inconsequential thing.\n 　　Interesting… “That’s a good sign. Was she pretty?”\n 　　Hmm. Jessica thought more of it that I did. Must be a female thing.\n 　　“Very,” Bella told her. “And probably nineteen or twenty.”\n 　　 Jessica was momentarily distracted by a memory of Mike on her date Mondaynight—Mike being a little too friendly with a waitress who Jessica did not consider \n prettyat all. She shoved the memory away and returned, stifling her irritation, to her quest fordetails.\n 　　“Even better. He must like you.”\n 　　“I think so,” Bella said slowly, and I was on the edge of my seat, my body rigidlystill. “But it’s hard to tell. He’s always so cryptic.”\n 　　I must not have been as transparently obvious and out of control as I’d thought.\n 　　Still…observant as she was… How could she not realize that I was in love with her? Isifted through our conversation, almost surprised that I hadn’t said the \n words out loud. Ithad felt like that knowledge had been the subtext of every word between us.\n 　　Wow. How do you sit there across from a male model and make conversation?\n 　　“I don’t know how you’re brave enough to be alone with him,” Jessica said.\n 　　Shock flashed across Bella’s face. “Why?”\n 　　Weird reaction. What does she think I meant? “He’s so…” What’s the rightword? “Intimidating. I wouldn’t know what to say to him.” I couldn’t even \n speakEnglish to him today, and all he said was good morning. I must have sounded like suchan idiot.\n 　　Bella smiled. “I do have some trouble with incoherency when I’m around him.”\n 　　She must be trying to make Jessica feel better. She was almost unnaturally self-possessed when we were together.\n 　　“Oh well,” Jessica sighed. “He is unbelievably gorgeous.”\n 　　Bella’s face was suddenly colder. Her eyes flashed the same way they did whenshe resented some injustice. Jessica didn’t process the change in her expression.\n 　　“There’s a lot more to him than that,” Bella snapped.\n 　　Oooh. Now we’re getting somewhere. “Really? Like what?”\n 　　Bella gnawed her lip for a moment. “I can’t explain it right,” she finally said.\n 　　“But he’s even more unbelievable behind the face.” She looked away from Jessica, hereyes slightly unfocused as if she was staring at something very far away.\n 　　The feeling I felt now was loosely similar to how it felt when Carlisle or Esmepraised me beyond what I deserved. Similar, but more intense, more consuming.\n 　　 Sell stupid somewhere else—there’s nothing better than that face! Unless it’s hisbody. Swoon. “Is that possible?” Jessica giggled.\n 　　Bella didn’t turn. She continued to stare into the distance, ignoring Jessica.\n 　　A normal person would be gloating. Maybe if I keep the questions simple. Ha ha.\n 　　Like I’m talking to a kindergartener. “So you like him, then?”\n 　　I was rigid again.\n 　　Bella didn’t look at Jessica. “Yes.”\n 　　“I mean, do you really like him?”\n 　　“Yes.”\n 　　Look at that blush!\n 　　I was.\n 　　“How much do you like him?” Jessica demanded.\n 　　The English room could have gone up in flames and I wouldn’t have noticed.\n 　　Bella’s face was bright red now—I could almost feel the heat from the mentalpicture.\n 　　“Too much,” she whispered. “More than he likes me. But I don’t see how I canhelp that.”\n 　　Shoot! What did Mr. Varner just ask? “Um—which number, Mr. Varner?”\n 　　It was good that Jessica could no longer quiz Bella. I needed a minute.\n 　　What on earth was that girl thinking now? More than he likes me? How did shecome up with that? But I don’t see how I can help that? What was that supposed tomean? \n I couldn’t fit a rational explanation to the words. They were practically senseless.\n 　　It seemed I couldn’t take anything for granted. Obvious things, things that madeperfect sense, somehow got twisted up and turned backwards in that bizarre brain of \n hers.\n 　　More than he likes me? Maybe I shouldn’t rule out the institution just yet.\n 　　I glared at the clock, gritting my teeth. How could mere minutes feel soimpossibly long to an immortal? Where was my perspective?\n 　　My jaw was tight throughout Mr. Varner’s entire trigonometry lesson. I heardmore of that than the lecture in my own class. Bella and Jessica didn’t speak again, \n butJessica peeked at Bella several times, and once her face was brilliant scarlet again for noapparent reason.\n 　　 Lunch couldn’t come fast enough.\n 　　I wasn’t sure if Jessica would get some of the answers I was waiting for when theclass was over, but Bella was quicker than she was.\n 　　As soon as the bell sounded, Bella turned to Jessica.\n 　　“In English, Mike asked me if you said anything about Monday night,” Bella said,a smile pulling at the corners of her lips. I understood this for what is was—\n offence asthe best defense.\n 　　Mike asked about me? Joy made Jessica’s mind suddenly unguarded, softer,without its usual snide edge. “You’re kidding! What did you say?”\n 　　“I told him you said you had a lot of fun—and he looked pleased.”\n 　　“Tell me exactly what he said, and your exact answer!”\n 　　That was all I was going to get from Jessica today, clearly. Bella was smiling likeshe was thinking the same thing. Like she’d won the round.\n 　　Well, lunch would be another story. I would have better success with gettinganswers out of her than Jessica, I would make sure of that.\n 　　I could hardly bear to check in occasionally with Jessica through the fourth hour.\n 　　I had no patience for her obsessive thoughts of Mike Newton. I’d had more than enoughof him in the last two weeks. He was lucky to be alive.\n 　　I moved apathetically through gym class with Alice, the way we always movedwhen it came to physical activity with humans. She was my teammate, naturally. It wasthe \n first day of badminton. I sighed with boredom, swinging the racket in slow motion totap the birdie back to the other side. Lauren Mallory was on the other team; she \n missed.\n 　　Alice was twirling her racket like a baton, staring at the ceiling.\n 　　We all hated gym, Emmett especially. Throwing games was an affront to hispersonal philosophy. Gym seemed worse today than usual—I felt just as irritated asEmmett \n always did.\n 　　Before my head could explode with impatience, Coach Clapp called the gamesand sent us out early. I was ridiculously grateful that he’d skipped breakfast—a \n freshattempt to diet—and the consequent hunger had him in a hurry to leave campus to find agreasy lunch somewhere. He promised himself he would start over tomorrow...\n 　　This gave me enough time to get to the math building before Bella’s class ended.\n 　　 Enjoy yourself, Alice thought as she headed off to meet Jasper. Just a few daysmore to be patient. I suppose you won’t say hi to Bella for me, will you?\n 　　I shook my head, exasperated. Were all psychics so smug?\n 　　FYI, it’s going to be sunny on both sides of the sound this weekend. You mightwant to rearrange your plans.\n 　　I sighed as I continued in the opposite direction. Smug, but definitely useful.\n 　　I leaned against the wall by the door, waiting. I was close enough that I couldhear Jessica’s voice through the bricks as well as her thoughts.\n 　　“You’re not sitting with us today, are you?” She looks all…lit up. I bet there’stons she didn’t tell me.\n 　　“I don’t think so,” Bella answered, oddly unsure.\n 　　Hadn’t I promised to spend lunch with her? What was she thinking?\n 　　They came out of the class together, and both girls’ eyes widened when they sawme. But I could only hear Jessica.\n 　　Nice. Wow. Oh, yeah, there’s more going on here than she’s telling me. MaybeI’ll call her tonight… Or maybe I shouldn’t encourage her. Huh. I hope he moves \n pasther in a hurry. Mike is cute but…wow.\n 　　“See you later, Bella.”\n 　　Bella walked toward me, pausing a step away, still unsure. Her skin was pinkacross her cheekbones.\n 　　I knew her well enough now to be sure that there was no fear behind herhesitation. Apparently, this was about some gulf she imagined between her feelings andmine. \n More than he likes me. Absurd!\n 　　“Hello,” I said, my voice a tad curt.\n 　　Her face got brighter. “Hi.”\n 　　She didn’t seem inclined to say anything else, so I led the way to the cafeteria andshe walked silently beside me.\n 　　The jacket had worked—her scent was not the blow it usually was. It was just anintensification of the pain I already felt. I could ignore it more easily than I \n once wouldhave believed possible.\n 　　 Bella was restless as we waited in line, toying absently with the zipper on herjacket and shifting nervously from foot to foot. She glanced at me often, but \n whenevershe met my gaze, she looked down as if she were embarrassed. Was this because somany people were staring at us? Maybe she could hear the loud whispers—the \n gossipwas verbal as well as mental today.\n 　　Or maybe she realized, from my expression, that she was in trouble.\n 　　She didn’t say anything until I was assembling her lunch. I didn’t know what sheliked—not yet—so I grabbed one of everything.\n 　　“What are you doing?” she hissed in a low voice. “You’re not getting all that forme?”\n 　　I shook my head, and shoved the tray up to the register. “Half is for me, ofcourse.”\n 　　She raised one eyebrow skeptically, but said nothing more as I paid for the foodand escorted her to the table we’d sat at last week before her disastrous \n experience withblood typing. It seemed like much more than a few days. Everything was different now.\n 　　She sat across from me again. I pushed the tray toward her.\n 　　“Take whatever you want,” I encouraged.\n 　　She picked up an apple and twisted it in her hands, a speculative look on her face.\n 　　“I’m curious.”\n 　　What a surprise.\n 　　“What would you do if someone dared you to eat food?” she continued in a lowvoice that wouldn’t carry to human ears. Immortal ears were another matter, if those \n earswere paying attention. I probably should have mentioned something to them earlier…“You’re always curious,” I complained. Oh well. It wasn’t like I hadn’t had \n toeat before. It was part of the charade. An unpleasant part.\n 　　I reached for the closest thing, and held her eyes while I bite off a small bite ofwhatever it was. Without looking, I couldn’t tell. It was as slimy and chunky \n andrepulsive as any other human food. I chewed swiftly and swallowed, trying to keep thegrimace off my face. The gob of food moved slowly and uncomfortably down my \n throat.\n 　　I sighed as I thought of how I would have to choke it back up later. Disgusting.\n 　　Bella’s expression was shocked. Impressed.\n 　　 I wanted to roll my eyes. Of course we would have perfected such deceptions.\n 　　“If someone dared you to eat dirt, you could, couldn’t you?”\n 　　Her nose wrinkled and she smiled. “I did once…on a dare. It wasn’t so bad.”\n 　　I laughed. “I suppose I’m not surprised.”\n 　　They look cozy, don’t they? Good body language. I’ll give Bella my take later.\n 　　He’s leaning toward her just the way he should, if he’s interested. He looks interested.\n 　　He looks…perfect. Jessica sighed. Yum.\n 　　I met Jessica’s curious eyes, and she looked away nervously, giggling to the girlnext to her.\n 　　Hmmm. Probably better to stick to Mike. Reality, not fantasy…“Jessica’s analyzing everything I do,” I informed Bella. “She’ll break it down foryou later.”\n 　　I pushed the plate of food back towards her—pizza, I realized—wondering howbest to begin. My former frustration flared as the words repeated in my head: More \n thanhe likes me. But I don’t see how I can help that.\n 　　She took a bite from the same slice of pizza. It amazed me how trusting she was.\n 　　Of course, she didn’t know I was poisonous—not that sharing food would hurt her. Still,I expected her to treat me differently. As something other. She never did—\n at least, notin a negative way…I would start off gently.\n 　　“So the waitress was pretty, was she?”\n 　　She raised the eyebrow again. “You really didn’t notice?”\n 　　As if any woman could hope to capture my attention from Bella. Absurd, again.\n 　　“No. I wasn’t paying attention. I had a lot on my mind.” Not the least of whichhad been the soft cling of her thin blouse…Good thing she’d worn that ugly \n sweater today.\n 　　“Poor girl,” Bella said, smiling.\n 　　She liked that I hadn’t found the waitress interesting in any way. I couldunderstand that. How many times had I imagined crippling Mike Newton in the biologyroom?\n 　　 She couldn’t honestly believe that her human feelings, the fruition of seventeenshort mortal years, could be stronger than the immortal passions that had been \n buildingup in me for a century.\n 　　“Something you said to Jessica…” I couldn’t keep my voice casual. “Well, itbothers me.”\n 　　She was immediately on the defensive. “I’m not surprised you heard somethingyou didn’t like. You know what they say about eavesdroppers.”\n 　　Eavesdroppers never hear good of themselves, that was the saying.\n 　　“I warned you I would be listening,” I reminded her.\n 　　“And I warned you that you didn’t want to know everything I was thinking.”\n 　　Ah, she was thinking of when I’d made her cry. Remorse made my voice thicker.\n 　　“You did. You aren’t precisely right, though. I do want to know what you’re thinking—everything. I just wish…that you wouldn’t be thinking some things.”\n 　　More half-lies. I knew I shouldn’t want her to care about me. But I did. Ofcourse I did.\n 　　“That’s quite a distinction,” she grumbled, scowling at me.\n 　　“But that’s not really the point at the moment.”\n 　　“Then what is?”\n 　　She leaned toward me, her hand cupped lightly around her throat. It drew myeye—distracted me. How soft that skin must feel…Focus, I commanded myself.\n 　　“Do you truly believe that you care more for me than I do for you?” I asked. Thequestion sounded ridiculous to me, like the words were scrambled.\n 　　Her eyes were wide, her breathing stopped. Then she looked away, blinkingquickly. Her breath came in a low gasp.\n 　　“You’re doing it again,” she murmured.\n 　　“What?”\n 　　“Dazzling me,” she admitted, meeting my eyes warily.\n 　　“Oh.” Hmm. I wasn’t quite sure what to do about that. Nor was I sure that Ididn’t want to dazzle her. I was still thrilled that I could. But it wasn’t helping \n theprogression of the conversation.\n 　　 “It’s not your fault.” She sighed. “You can’t help it.”\n 　　“Are you going to answer my question?” I demanded.\n 　　She stared at the table. “Yes.”\n 　　That was all she said.\n 　　“Yes, you are going to answer, or yes, you really think that?” I asked impatiently.\n 　　“Yes, I really think that,” she said without looking up. There was a faintundertone of sadness in her voice. She blushed again, and her teeth moved \n unconsciouslyto worry her lip.\n 　　Abruptly, I realized that this was very hard for her to admit, because she trulybelieved it. And I was no better than that coward, Mike, asking for her to confirm \n herfeelings before I’d confirmed my own. It didn’t matter that I felt I’d make my sideabundantly clear. It hadn’t gotten through to her, and so I had no excuse.\n 　　“You’re wrong,” I promised. She must hear the tenderness in my voice.\n 　　Bella looked up to me, her eyes opaque, giving nothing away. “You can’t knowthat,” she whispered.\n 　　She thought that I was underestimating her feelings because I couldn’t hear herthoughts. But, in truth, the problem was that she was underestimating mine.\n 　　“What makes you think so?” I wondered.\n 　　She stared back at me, the furrow between her brows, biting her lips. For themillionth time, I wished desperately that I could just hear her.\n 　　I was about to beg her to tell me what thought she was struggling with, but sheheld up a finger to keep me from speaking.\n 　　“Let me think,” she requested.\n 　　As long as she was simply organizing her thoughts, I could be patient.\n 　　Or I could pretend to be.\n 　　She pressed her hands together, twining and untwining her slender fingers. Shewas watching her hands as if they belonged to someone else while she spoke.\n 　　“Well, aside from the obvious,” she murmured. “Sometimes… I can’t be sure—Idon’t know how to read minds—but sometimes it seems like you’re trying to \n saygoodbye when you’re saying something else.” She didn’t look up.\n 　　 She’d caught that, had she? Did she realize that it was only weakness andselfishness that kept me here? Did she think less of me for that?\n 　　“Perceptive,” I breathed, and then watched in horror as pain twisted herexpression. I hurried to contradict her assumption. “That’s exactly why you’re \n wrong,though—” I began, and then I paused, remembering the first words of her explanation.\n 　　They bothered me, though I wasn’t sure I understood exactly. “What do you mean, ‘theobvious’?”\n 　　“Well, look at me,” she said.\n 　　I was looking. All I ever did was look at her. What did she mean?\n 　　“I’m absolutely ordinary,” she explained. “Well, except for the bad things like allthe near death experiences and being so clumsy that I’m almost disabled. And \n look atyou.” She fanned the air toward me, like she was making some point so obvious itwasn’t worth spelling out.\n 　　She thought she was ordinary? She thought that I was somehow preferable toher? In whose estimation? Silly, narrow-minded, blind humans like Jessica or Ms.\n 　　Cope? How could she not realize that she was the most beautiful…most exquisite…Those words weren’t even enough.\n 　　And she had no idea.\n 　　“You don’t see yourself very clearly, you know,” I told her. “I’ll admit you’redead-on about the bad things…” I laughed humorlessly. I did not find the evil \n fate whohaunted her comical. The clumsiness, however, was sort of funny. Endearing. Wouldshe believe me if I told her she was beautiful, inside and out? Perhaps she \n would findcorroboration more persuasive. “But you didn’t hear what every human male wasthinking on your first day.”\n 　　Ah, the hope, the thrill, the eagerness of those thoughts. The speed with whichthey’d turned to impossible fantasies. Impossible, because she wanted none of them.\n 　　I was the one she said yes to.\n 　　My smile must have been smug.\n 　　Her face was blank with surprise. “I don’t believe it,” she mumbled.\n 　　“Trust me just this once—you are the opposite of ordinary.”\n 　　Her existence alone was excuse enough to justify the creation of the entire world.\n 　　 She wasn’t used to compliments, I could see that. Another thing she would justhave to get used to. She flushed, and changed the subject. “But I’m not \n sayinggoodbye.”\n 　　“Don’t you see? That’s what proves me right. I care the most, because if I can doit…” Would I ever be unselfish enough to do the right thing? I shook my head \n indespair. I would have to find the strength. She deserved a life. Not what Alice had seencoming for her. “If leaving is the right thing to do…” And it had to be the \n right thing,didn’t it? There was no reckless angel. Bella didn’t belong with me. “Then I’ll hurtmyself to keep from hurting you, to keep you safe.”\n 　　As I said the words, I willed them to be true.\n 　　She glared at me. Somehow, my words had angered her. “And you don’t think Iwould do the same?” she demanded furiously.\n 　　So furious—so soft and so fragile. How could she ever hurt anyone? “You’dnever have to make the choice,” I told her, depressed anew by the wide \n differencebetween us.\n 　　She stared at me, concern replacing the anger in her eyes and bringing out thelittle pucker between them.\n 　　There was something truly wrong with the order of the universe if someone sogood and so breakable did not merit a guardian angel to keep her out of trouble.\n 　　Well, I thought with dark humor, at least she has a guardian vampire.\n 　　I smiled. How I loved my excuse to stay. “Of course, keeping you safe isbeginning to feel like a full-time occupation that requires my constant presence.”\n 　　She smiled, too. “No one has tried to do away with me today,” she said lightly,and then her face turned speculative for half a second before her eyes went opaque \n again.\n 　　“Yet,” I added dryly.\n 　　“Yet,” she agreed to my surprise. I’d expected her to deny any need forprotection.\n 　　How could he? That selfish jackass! How could he do this to us? Rosalie’spiercing mental shriek broke through my concentration.\n 　　“Easy, Rose,” I heard Emmett whisper from across the cafeteria. His arm wasaround her shoulders, holding her tight into his side—restraining her.\n 　　 Sorry, Edward, Alice thought guiltily. She could tell Bella knew too much fromyour conversation…and, well, it would have been worse if I hadn’t told her the \n truth rightaway. Trust me on that.\n 　　I winced at the mental picture that followed, at what would have happened if I’dtold Rosalie that Bella knew I was a vampire at home, where Rosalie didn’t have a \n fa.adeto keep up. I’d have to hide my Aston Martin somewhere out of state if she didn’t calmdown by the time school was over. The sight of my favorite car, mangled \n and burning,was upsetting—though I knew I’d earned the retribution.\n 　　Jasper was not much happier.\n 　　I’d deal with the others later. I only had so much time allotted to be to be withBella, and I wasn’t going to waste it. And hearing Alice had reminded me that I \n hadsome business to attend to.\n 　　“I have another question for you,” I said, tuning out Rosalie’s mental hysterics.\n 　　“Shoot,” Bella said, smiling.\n 　　“Do you really need to go to Seattle this Saturday, or was that just an excuse toget out of saying no to all your admirers?”\n 　　She grimaced at me. “You know, I haven’t forgiven you for the Tyler thing yet.\n 　　It’s your fault that he’s deluded himself into thinking I’m going to prom with him.”\n 　　“Oh, he would have found a chance to ask you without me—I just really wantedto watch your face.”\n 　　I laughed now, remembering her aghast expression. Nothing I’d ever told herabout my own dark story had ever made her look so horrified. The truth didn’t \n frightenher. She wanted to be with me. Mind-boggling.\n 　　“If I’d asked you, would you have turned me down?”\n 　　“Probably not,” she said. “But I would have cancelled later—faked an illness or asprained ankle.”\n 　　How strange. “Why would you do that?”\n 　　She shook her head, as if she was disappointed that I did not understand at once.\n 　　“You’ve never seen me in gym, I guess, but I would have thought that you wouldunderstand.”\n 　　 Ah. “Are you referring to the fact that you can’t walk across a flat, stable surfacewithout finding something to trip over?”\n 　　“Obviously.”\n 　　“That wouldn’t be a problem. It’s all in the leading.”\n 　　For a brief fraction of a second, I was overwhelmed by the idea of holding her inmy arms at a dance—where she would surely wear something pretty and delicate \n ratherthan this hideous sweater.\n 　　With perfect clarity, I remembered how her body had felt under mine after I’dthrown her out of the way of the oncoming van. Stronger than the panic or \n thedesperation or the chagrin, I could remember that sensation. She’d been so warm and sosoft, fitting easily into my own stone shape…I wrenched myself back from the \n memory.\n 　　“But you never told me—” I said quickly, preventing her from arguing with meabout her clumsiness, as she clearly intended to do. “Are you resolved on going \n toSeattle, or do you mind if we do something different?”\n 　　Devious—giving her a choice without giving her the option of getting away fromme for the day. Hardly fair of me. But I had made her a promise last night…and I \n likedthe idea of fulfilling it—almost as much as that idea terrified me.\n 　　The sun would be shining Saturday. I could show her the real me, if I was braveenough to endure her horror and disgust. I knew just the place to take such a risk…\n “I’m open to alternatives,” Bella said. “But I do have a favor to ask.”\n 　　A qualified yes. What would she want from me?\n 　　“What?”\n 　　“Can I drive?”\n 　　Was this her idea of humor? “Why?”\n 　　“Well, mostly because when I told Charlie I was going to Seattle, he specificallyasked if I was going alone and, at the time, I was. If he asked again, I probably \n wouldn’tlie, but I don’t think he will ask again, and leaving my truck at home would just bring upthe subject unnecessarily. And also, because your driving frightens \n me.”\n 　　 I rolled my eyes at her. “Of all the things about me that could frighten you, youworry about my driving.” Truly, her brain worked backwards. I shook my \n head,disgusted.\n 　　Edward, Alice called urgently.\n 　　Suddenly I was staring into a bright circle of sunlight, caught up in one of Alice’svisions.\n 　　It was a place I knew well, the place I’d just considered taking Bella—a littlemeadow where no one ever went beside myself. A quiet, pretty place where I \n couldcount on being alone—far enough from any trail or human habitation that even my mindcould have peace and quiet.\n 　　Alice recognized it, too, because she had seen me there not so long ago in anothervision—one of those flickering, indistinct visions that Alice had shown me the \n morningI’d saved Bella from the van.\n 　　In that flickering vision, I hadn’t been alone. And now it was clear—Bella waswith me there. So I was brave enough. She stared at me, rainbows dancing across \n herface, her eyes fathomless.\n 　　It’s the same place, Alice thought, her mind full of a horror that did not match thevision. Tension, perhaps, but horror? What did she mean, the same place?\n 　　And then I saw it.\n 　　Edward! Alice protested shrilly. I love her, Edward!\n 　　I shut her out viciously.\n 　　She didn’t love Bella the way I did. Her vision was impossible. Wrong. She wasblinded somehow, seeing impossibilities.\n 　　Not even a half a second had passed. Bella was looking curiously at my face,waiting for me to approve her request. Had she seen the flash of dread, or had it been \n tooquick for her?\n 　　I focused on her, on our unfinished conversation, pushing Alice and her flawed,lying visions far from my thoughts. They didn’t deserve my attention.\n 　　I wasn’t able to keep up the playful tone of our banter, though.\n 　　“Won’t you want to tell your father that you’re spending the day with me?” Iasked, darkness seeping into my voice.\n 　　 I shoved at the visions again, trying to push them farther away, to keep them fromflickering through my head.\n 　　“With Charlie, less is always more,” Bella said, certain of this fact. “Where arewe going, anyway?”\n 　　Alice was wrong. Dead wrong. There was no chance of that. And it was just anold vision, invalid now. Things had changed.\n 　　“The weather will be nice,” I told her slowly, fighting the panic and indecision.\n 　　Alice was wrong. I would continue as if I hadn’t heard or seen anything. “So I’ll bestaying out of the public eye…and you can stay with me, if you’d like to.”\n 　　Bella caught the significance at once; her eyes were bright and eager. “Andyou’ll show me what you meant, about the sun?”\n 　　Maybe, like so many times before, her reaction would be the opposite of what Iexpected. I smiled at that possibility, struggling to return to the lighter moment. “\n Yes.\n 　　But…” She hadn’t said yes. “If you don’t want to be…alone with me, I’d still rather youdidn’t go to Seattle by yourself. I shudder to think of the trouble \n you could find in a citythat size.”\n 　　Her lips pressed together; she was offended.\n 　　“Phoenix is three times bigger than Seattle—just in population. In physicalsize—”\n 　　“But apparently your number wasn’t up in Phoenix,” I said, cutting off herjustifications. “So I’d rather you stayed with me.”\n 　　She could stay forever and it would not be long enough.\n 　　I shouldn’t think that way. We didn’t have forever. The passing seconds countedmore than they ever had before; each second changed her while I remained untouched.\n 　　“As it happens, I don’t mind being alone with you,” she said.\n 　　No—because her instincts were backwards.\n 　　“I know.” I sighed. “You should tell Charlie, though.”\n 　　“Why in the world would I do that?” she asked, sounding horrified.\n 　　I glared at her, the visions I couldn’t quite manage to repress swirling sickeninglythrough my head.\n 　　 “To give me some small incentive to bring you back,” I hissed. She should giveme that much—one witness to compel me to be cautious.\n 　　Why had Alice forced this knowledge on me now?\n 　　Bella swallowed loudly, and stared at me for a long moment. What did she see?\n 　　“I think I’ll take my chances,” she said.\n 　　Ugh! Did she get some thrill out of risking her life? Some shot of adrenaline shecraved?\n 　　I scowled at Alice, who met my glare with a warning glance. Beside her, Rosaliewas glowering furiously, but I couldn’t have cared less. Let her destroy the car. It \n wasjust a toy.\n 　　“Let’s talk about something else,” Bella suggested suddenly.\n 　　I looked back at her, wondering how she could be so oblivious to what reallymattered. Why wouldn’t she see me for the monster I was?\n 　　“What do you want to talk about?”\n 　　Her eyes darted to the left and then the right, as if checking to make sure therewere no eavesdroppers. She must be planning to introduce another myth-related \n topic.\n 　　Her eyes froze for a second and her body stiffened, and then she looked back to me.\n 　　“Why did you go to that Goat Rocks place last weekend…to hunt? Charlie said itwasn’t a good place to hike, because of bears.”\n 　　So oblivious. I stared at her, raising one eyebrow.\n 　　“Bears?” she gasped.\n 　　I smiled wryly, watching that sink in. Would this make her take me seriously?\n 　　Would anything?\n 　　She pulled her expression together. “You know, bears are not in season,” she saidseverely, narrowing her eyes.\n 　　“If you read carefully, the laws only cover hunting with weapons.”\n 　　She lost control over her face again for a moment. Her lips fell open.\n 　　“Bears?” she said again, a tentative question this time rather than a gasp of shock.\n 　　“Grizzly is Emmett’s favorite.”\n 　　I watched her eyes, seeing this settle in.\n 　　 “Hmm,” she murmured. She took a bite of the pizza, looking down. She chewedthoughtfully, and then took a drink.\n 　　“So,” she said, finally looking up. “What’s your favorite?”\n 　　I supposed I should have expected something like that, but I hadn’t. Bella wasalways interesting, at the very least.\n 　　“Mountain lion,” I answered brusquely.\n 　　“Ah,” she said in a neutral tone. Her heartbeat continued steady and even, as ifwe were discussing a favorite restaurant.\n 　　Fine, then. If she wanted to act like this was nothing unusual…“Of course, we have to be careful not to impact the environment with injudicioushunting,” I told \n her, my voice detached and clinical. “We try to focus on areas with anoverpopulation of predators—ranging as far away as we need. There’s always plenty ofdeer and \n elk here, and they’ll do, but where’s the fun in that?”\n 　　She listened with a politely interested expression, as if I were a teacher giving alecture. I had to smile.\n 　　“Where indeed,” she murmured calmly, taking another bite of pizza.\n 　　“Early spring is Emmett’s favorite bear season,” I said, continuing with thelecture. “They’re just coming out of hibernation, so they’re more irritable.”\n 　　Seventy years later, and he still hadn’t gotten over losing that first match.\n 　　“Nothing more fun than an irritated grizzly bear,” Bella agreed, noddingsolemnly.\n 　　I couldn’t hold back a chuckle as I shook my head at her illogical calm. It had tobe put on. “Tell me what you’re really thinking, please.”\n 　　“I’m trying to picture it—but I can’t,” she said, the crease appearing between hereyes. “How to you hunt a bear without weapons?”\n 　　“Oh, we have weapons,” I told her, and then flashed her a wide smile. I expectedher to recoil, but she was very still, watching me. “Just not the kind they \n consider whenwriting hunting laws. If you’ve ever seen a bear attack on television, you should be ableto visualize Emmett hunting.”\n 　　She glanced toward the table where the others sat, and shuddered.\n 　　 Finally. And then I laughed at myself, because I knew part of me was wishingshe would stay oblivious.\n 　　Her dark eyes were wide and deep as she stared at me now. “Are you like a bear,too?” she asked in an almost-whisper.\n 　　“More like the lion, or so they tell me,” I told her, striving to sound detachedagain. “Perhaps our preferences are indicative.”\n 　　Her lips pulled up a tiny bit at the corners. “Perhaps,” she repeated. And then herhead leaned to the side, and curiosity was suddenly clear in her eyes. “Is \n that something Imight get to see?”\n 　　I didn’t need pictures from Alice to illustrate this horror—my imagination wasquite enough.\n 　　“Absolutely not,” I snarled at her.\n 　　She jerked away from me, her eyes bewildered and frightened.\n 　　I leaned back, too, wanting to put space between us. She was never going to see,was she? She wouldn’t do one thing to help me keep her alive.\n 　　“Too scary for me?” she asked, her voice even. Her heart, however, was stillmoving in double time.\n 　　“If that were it, I would take you out tonight,” I retorted through my teeth. “Youneed a healthy dose of fear. Nothing could be more beneficial for you.”\n 　　“Then why?” she demanded, undeterred.\n 　　I glared at her blackly, waiting for her to be afraid. I was afraid. I could imagineonly too clearly having Bella near when I hunted…Her eyes remained curious, \n impatient, nothing more. She waited for her answer,not giving in.\n 　　But our hour was up.\n 　　“Later,” I snapped, and I rose to my feet. “We’re going to be late.”\n 　　She looked around herself, disoriented, like she’d forgotten we were at lunch.\n 　　Like she’d forgotten we were even at school—surprised that we were not alone i\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/160/6112.html","bookId":316,"book":{"id":316,"title":"暮光之城：午夜阳光 Midnight Sun","description":"简介： Midnight Sun is an unreleased companion novel to the book Twilight by author Stephenie Meyer.
