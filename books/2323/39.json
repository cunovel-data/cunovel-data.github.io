{"id":62983,"no":39,"title":"Page 39","content":"\"Figure he had sex with her?\" \"Hard to tell unless there\u0027s traces on the sheets. He doesn\u0027t figure as her first trick of the evening.\" \"He took a shower?\" Garfein shrugged, showed his hands palms up. \"Go know,\" he said. \"The manager says there\u0027s towels missing. When they make up the room they put out two bath towels and two hand towels, and both of the bath towels are missing.\" \"He took towels from the Galaxy.\" \"Then he probably took \u0027em here, but who knows in a dump like this? I mean who knows if they always remember to make up the room right. Same with the shower. I don\u0027t figure they gave it a scrub after the last party left.\" \"Maybe you\u0027ll find something.\" \"Maybe.\" \"Fingerprints, something. You see any skin under her nails?\" \"No. But that\u0027s not to say the lab boys won\u0027t.\" A muscle worked in his jaw. \"I\u0027ll say one thing. Thank God I\u0027m not a medical examiner or a technician. It\u0027s bad enough being a cop.\" \"Amen to that,\" Durkin said. I said, \"If he picked her up on the street, somebody might have seen her get into the car.\" \"A couple of guys are out there now trying to take statements. We might get something. If anybody saw anything, and if they remember, and if they feel like talking.\" \"Lots of ifs,\" Durkin said. \"The manager here must have seen him,\" I said. \"What does he remember?\" \"Not a whole lot. Let\u0027s go talk to him some more.\" The manager had a night worker\u0027s sallow complexion and a pair of red-rimmed eyes. There was alcohol on his breath but he didn\u0027t have a drinker\u0027s way about him, and I guessed he\u0027d tried to fortify himself with liquor after discovering the body. It only made him vague and ineffectual. \"This is a decent place,\" he insisted, and the statement was so palpably absurd no one responded to it. I suppose he meant murder wasn\u0027t a daily occurrence. He never saw Cookie. The man who had presumably killed her had come in alone, filled out the card, paid cash. This was not unusual. It was common practice for the woman to wait in the car while the man checked in. The car had not stopped directly in front of the office, so he hadn\u0027t seen it while the man was checking in. In fact he hadn\u0027t really seen the car at all. \"You saw it was missing,\" Garfein reminded him. \"That\u0027s how you knew the room was empty.\" \"Except it wasn\u0027t. I opened the door and-\" \"You thought it was empty because the car was gone. How\u0027d you know it was gone if you never saw it?\" \"The parking space was empty. There\u0027s a space in front of each unit, the spaces are numbered same as the units. I looked out, that space was empty, that meant his car was gone.\" \"They always park in the proper spaces?\" \"They\u0027re supposed to.\" \"Lots of things people are supposed to do. Pay their taxes, don\u0027t spit on the sidewalk, cross only at corners. A guy\u0027s in a hurry to dip his wick, what does he care about a number on a parking space? You got a look at the car.\" \"I-\" \"You looked once, maybe twice, and the car was parked in the space. Then you looked later and it wasn\u0027t and that\u0027s when you decided they were gone. Isn\u0027t that what happened?\" \"I guess so.\" \"Describe the car.\" \"I didn\u0027t really look at it. I looked to see that it was there, that\u0027s all.\" \"What color was it?\" \"Dark.\" \"Terrific. Two door? Four door?\" \"I didn\u0027t notice.\" \"New? Old? What make?\" \"It was a late-model car,\" he said. \"American. Not a foreign car. As far as the make, when I was a kid they all looked different. Now every car\u0027s the same.\" \"He\u0027s right,\" Durkin said. \"Except American Motors,\" he said. \"A Gremlin, a Pacer, those you can tell. The rest all look the same.\" \"And this wasn\u0027t a Gremlin or a Pacer.\" \"No.\" \"Was it a sedan? A hatchback?\" \"I\u0027ll tell you the truth,\" the man said. \"All I noticed is it was a car. It says on the card, the make and model, the plate number.\" \"You\u0027re talking about the registration card?\" \"Yeah. They have to fill all that in.\" The card was on the desk, a sheet of clear acetate over it to preserve prints until the lab boys had their shot at it. Name: Martin Albert Ricone. Address: 211 Gilford Way. City: Fort Smith, Arkansas. Make of Auto: Chevrolet. Year: 1980. Model: Sedan. Color: Black. License No.: LJK-914. Signature: M. A. RICONE. \"Looks like the same hand,\" I told Durkin. \"But who can tell with printing?\" \"The experts can say. Same as they can tell you if he had the same light touch with the machete. Guy likes forts, you notice? Fort Wayne, Indiana and Fort Smith, Arkansas.\" \"A subtle pattern begins to emerge,\" Garfein said. \"Ricone,\" Durkin said. \"Must be Italian.\" \"M. A. Ricone sounds like the guy who invented the radio.\" \"That\u0027s Marconi,\" Durkin said. \"Well, that\u0027s close. This guy\u0027s Macaroni. Stuck a feather in his hat and called it Macaroni.\" \"Stuck a feather up his ass,\" Durkin said. \"Maybe he stuck it up Cookie\u0027s ass and maybe it wasn\u0027t a feather. Martin Albert Ricone, that\u0027s a fancy alias. What did he use last time?\" \"Charles Owen Jones,\" I said. \"Oh, he likes middle names. He\u0027s a cute fucker, isn\u0027t he?\" \"Very cute,\" Durkin said. \"The cute ones, the really cute ones, usually everything means something. Like Jones is slang, it means a habit. You know, like a heroin jones. Like a junkie says he\u0027s got a hundred-dollar jones, that\u0027s what his habit costs him per day.\" \"I\u0027m really glad you explained that for me,\" Durkin said. \"Just trying to be helpful.\" \" \u0027Cause I only got fourteen years in, I never had any contact yet with smack addicts.\" \"So be a smart fuck,\" Garfein said. \"The license plate go anywhere?\" \"It\u0027s gonna go the same place as the name and address. I got a call in to Arkansas Motor Vehicles but it\u0027s a waste of time. A place like this, even the legitimate guests make up the plate number. They don\u0027t park in front of the window when they sign in so our guy here can\u0027t check. Not that he would anyway, would you?\" \"There\u0027s no law says I have to check,\" the man said. \"They use false names, too. Funny our boy used Jones at the Galaxy and Ricone here. They must get a lot of Joneses here, along with the usual run of Smiths and Browns. You get a lot of Smiths?\" \"There\u0027s no law says I\u0027m supposed to check ID,\" the man said. \"Or wedding rings, huh?\" \"Or wedding rings or marriage licenses or anything. Consenting adults, the hell, it\u0027s none of my business.\" \"Maybe Ricone means something in Italian,\" Garfein suggested. \"Now you\u0027re thinking,\" Durkin said. He asked the manager if he had an Italian dictionary. The man stared at him, baffled. \"And they call this place a motel,\" he said, shaking his head. \"There\u0027s probably no Gideon Bibles, either.\" \"Most of the rooms have them.\" \"Jesus, really? Right next to the television with the X-rated movies, right? Conveniently located near the waterbed.\" \"Only two of the units have waterbeds,\" the poor bastard said. \"There\u0027s an extra charge for a waterbed.\" \"Good thing our Mr. Ricone\u0027s a cheap prick,\" Garfein said. \"Cookie\u0027da wound up underwater.\" \"Tell me about this guy,\" Durkin said. \"Describe him again.\" \"I told you-\" \"You\u0027re gonna get to tell this again and again. How tall was he?\" \"Tall.\" \"My height? Shorter? Taller?\" \"I-\" \"What was he wearing? He have a hat on? He wearing a tie?\" \"It\u0027s hard to remember.\" \"He walks in the door, asks you for a room. Now he\u0027s filling out the card. Pays you in cash. What do you get for a room like that, incidentally?\" \"Twenty-eight dollars.\" \"That\u0027s not such a bad deal. I suppose the porn movies are extra.\" \"It\u0027s coin-operated.\" \"Handy. Twenty-eight\u0027s fair, and it\u0027s a good deal for you if you can flip the room a few times a night. How\u0027d he pay you?\" \"I told you. Cash.\" \"I mean what kind of bills? What\u0027d he give you, a pair of fifteens?\" \"A pair of-\" \"He give you a twenty and a ten?\" \"I think it was two twenties.\" \"And you gave him twelve bucks back? Wait, there must have been tax, right?\" \"It\u0027s twenty-nine forty with the tax.\" \"And he gave you forty bucks and you gave him the change.\" Something registered. \"He gave me two twenties and forty cents in change,\" the man said. \"And I gave him a ten and a one.\" \"See? You remember the transaction.\" \"Yeah, I do. Sort of.\" \"Now tell me what he looked like. He white?\" \"Yeah, sure. White.\" \"Heavy? Thin?\" \"Thin but not too thin. On the thin side.\" \"Beard?\" \"No.\" \"Moustache?\" \"Maybe. I don\u0027t know.\" \"There was something about him, though, something that stuck in your memory.\" \"What?\" \"That\u0027s what we\u0027re trying to get, John. That what they call you? John?\" \"Mostly it\u0027s Jack.\" \"Okay, Jack. You\u0027re doin\u0027 fine now. What about his hair?\" \"I didn\u0027t pay attention to his hair.\" \"Sure you did. He bent over to sign in and you saw the top of his head, remember?\" \"I don\u0027t-\" \"Full head of hair?\" \"I don\u0027t-\" \"They\u0027ll sit him down with one of our artists,\" Durkin said, \"and he\u0027ll come up with something. And when this fucking psycho ripper steps on his cock one of these days, when we catch him in the act or on his way out the door, he\u0027ll look as much like the police artist\u0027s sketch as I look like Sara fucking Blaustein. She looked like a woman, didn\u0027t she?\" \"Mostly she looked dead.\" \"I know. Meat in a butcher\u0027s window.\" We were in his car, driving over the bumpy surface of the Queensboro Bridge. The sky was starting to lighten up already. I was beyond tiredness by now, with the ragged edges of my emotions perilously close to the surface. I could feel my own vulnerability; the smallest thing could nudge me to tears or laughter. \"You gotta wonder what it would be like,\" he said. \"What?\" \"Picking up somebody who looked like that. On the street or in a bar, whatever. Then you get her someplace and she takes her clothes off and surprise. I mean, how do you react?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" \" \u0027Course if she already had the operation, you could go with her and never know. Her hands didn\u0027t look so big to me. There\u0027s women with big hands and men with little hands, far as that goes.\" \"Uh-huh.\" \"She had a couple rings on, speaking of her hands. You happen to notice?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/eight-million-ways-to-die-matthew-scudder-5/page-39.html","bookId":2323,"book":{"id":2323,"title":"Eight Million Ways to Die (Matthew Scudder #5)","description":"Storyline: Eight Million Ways to Die (Matthew Scudder #5) Nobody knows better than Matthew Scudder how far down a person can sink in this city.
