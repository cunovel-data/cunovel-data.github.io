{"id":62950,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"He hadn\u0027t. Chance and his girl were in the first row and a good deal closer to the center. They took their seats and he tipped the usher, acknowledged greetings from some of the other spectators, then approached Kid Bascomb\u0027s corner and said something to the fighter and his handlers. They huddled together for a moment. Then Chance returned to his seat.\\n\\n \"I think I\u0027ll leave now,\" Danny Boy said. \"I don\u0027t really want to watch these two fools pummel each other. I hope you don\u0027t need me to introduce you?\" I shook my head. \"Then I\u0027ll slip out before the mayhem commences. In the ring, that is. Will he have to know I fingered him, Matt?\"\\n\\n \"He won\u0027t hear it from me.\"\\n\\n \"Good. If I can be of further service-\"\\n\\n He made his way up the aisle. He probably wanted a drink and the bars in Madison Square Garden don\u0027t stock ice-cold Stolichnaya.\\n\\n The announcer was introducing the fighters, calling out their ages and weights and hometowns. Bascomb was twenty-two and undefeated. Canelli didn\u0027t figure to change his status tonight.\\n\\n There were two seats empty next to Chance. I thought about taking one but stayed where I was. The warning buzzer sounded, then the bell for round one. It was a slow, thoughtful round, with neither fighter anxious to commit himself. Bascomb jabbed nicely but Canelli managed to be out of range most of the time. Nobody landed anything solid.\\n\\n The pair next to Chance were still empty at the round\u0027s end. I walked over there and sat next to him. He was looking very intently at the ring. He must have been aware of my presence but didn\u0027t indicate it if he was.\\n\\n I said, \"Chance? My name is Scudder.\"\\n\\n He turned, looked at me. His eyes were brown flecked with gold. I thought of my client\u0027s eyes, that unreal blue. He\u0027d been at her apartment last night while I was barhopping, dropped in unannounced to pick up some money. She\u0027d told me about it earlier, called me at the hotel around noon. \"I was afraid,\" she\u0027d said. \"I thought, suppose he asks about you, asks me some kind of questions. But it was cool.\"\\n\\n Now he said, \"Matthew Scudder. You left some messages with my service.\"\\n\\n \"You didn\u0027t return my calls.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know you. I don\u0027t call people I don\u0027t know. And you\u0027ve been asking around town for me.\" His voice was deep and resonant. It sounded trained, as if he\u0027d gone to broadcasting school. \"I want to watch this fight,\" he said.\\n\\n \"All I want is a few minutes conversation.\"\\n\\n \"Not during the fight and not between rounds.\" A frown came and went. \"I want to be able to concentrate. I bought that seat you\u0027re sitting in, you see, so I\u0027d have some privacy.\"\\n\\n The warning buzzer sounded. Chance turned, focused his eyes on the ring. Kid Bascomb was standing and his seconds were hauling the stool out of the ring. \"Go back to your seat,\" Chance said, \"and I\u0027ll talk to you after the fight ends.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a ten-rounder?\"\\n\\n \"It won\u0027t go ten.\"\\n\\n It didn\u0027t. In the third or fourth round Kid Bascomb started getting to Canelli, punishing him with the jab, putting a couple of combinations together. Canelli was smart but the Kid was young and fast and strong, with a way of moving that reminded me a little of Sugar Ray. Robinson, not Leonard. In the fifth round he staggered Canelli with a short right hand to the heart and if I\u0027d had a bet on the Italian I\u0027d have written it off then and there.\\n\\n Canelli looked strong by the end of the round but I\u0027d seen the expression on his face when the blow landed, and I wasn\u0027t surprised a round later when Kid Bascomb dropped him with a looping left hook. He was up at three and took an eight-count, and then the Kid was all over him, hitting him with everything but the ring posts. Canelli went down again and got right up and the ref jumped between the two of them and looked in Canelli\u0027s eyes and stopped it.\\n\\n There was some halfhearted booing from the diehards who never want a fight stopped, and one of Canelli\u0027s cornermen was insisting his fighter could have gone on, but Canelli himself seemed just as happy the show was over. Kid Bascomb did a little war dance and took his bows, then climbed nimbly over the ropes and left the ring.\\n\\n On his way out he stopped to talk to Chance. The girl with the auburn hair sat forward and rested a hand on the fighter\u0027s glossy black arm. Chance and the Kid talked for a moment or two, and then the Kid headed for his dressing room.\\n\\n I left my seat, walked over to Chance and the girl. They were standing by the time I got there. He said, \"We\u0027re not staying for the main bout. If you\u0027d planned on watching it-\"\\n\\n The top of the card matched two middleweights, a Panamanian contender and a black boy from South Philadelphia with a reputation as a spoiler. It would probably be a good bout, but that wasn\u0027t what I\u0027d come for. I told him I was ready to leave.\\n\\n \"Then why don\u0027t you come with us,\" he suggested. \"I have a car nearby.\" He headed up the aisle with the girl at his side. A few people said hello to him and some of them told him that the Kid had looked good in there. Chance didn\u0027t say much in reply. I tagged along, and when we got outside and hit the fresh air I realized for the first time how stale and smoky it had been inside the Garden.\\n\\n On the street he said, \"Sonya, this is Matthew Scudder. Mr. Scudder, Sonya Hendryx.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s nice to meet you,\" she said, but I didn\u0027t believe her. Her eyes told me she was withholding judgment until Chance cued her in one way or the other. I wondered if she was the Sunny that Kim had mentioned, the sports fan Chance took to ball games. I wondered, too, if I would have pegged her for a hooker if I\u0027d met her in other circumstances. I couldn\u0027t see anything unmistakably whorish about her, and yet she didn\u0027t look at all out of place hanging on a pimp\u0027s arm.\\n\\n We walked a block south and half a block east to a parking lot where Chance collected his car and tipped the attendant enough to get thanked with more than the usual degree of enthusiasm. The car surprised me, just as the clothes and manner had surprised me earlier. I was expecting a pimpmobile, complete with custom paint and interior and the usual wretched excess, and what showed up was a Seville, the small Cadillac, silver on the outside with a black leather interior. The girl got in back, Chance sat behind the wheel, and I sat in front next to him.\\n\\n The ride was smooth, silent. The car\u0027s interior smelled of wood polish and leather. Chance said, \"There\u0027s a victory party for Kid Bascomb. I\u0027ll drop Sonya there now and join her after we\u0027ve concluded our business. What did you think of the fight?\"\\n\\n \"I thought it was hard to figure.\"\\n\\n \"Oh?\"\\n\\n \"It looked fixed but the knockout looked real.\"\\n\\n He glanced at me, and I saw interest in his gold-flecked eyes for the first time. \"What makes you say that?\"\\n\\n \"Canelli had an opening twice in the fourth round and he didn\u0027t follow it up either time. He\u0027s too smart a fighter for that. But he was trying to get through the sixth and he couldn\u0027t. At least that\u0027s how it looked from my seat.\"\\n\\n \"You ever box, Scudder?\"\\n\\n \"Two fights at the Y when I was twelve or thirteen years old. Balloon gloves, protective headgear, two-minute rounds. I was too low and clumsy for it, I could never manage to land a punch.\"\\n\\n \"You have an eye for the sport.\"\\n\\n \"Well, I guess I\u0027ve seen a lot of fights.\"\\n\\n He was silent for a moment. A cab cut us off and he braked smoothly, avoiding a collision. He didn\u0027t swear or hit the horn. He said, \"Canelli was set to go in the eighth. He was supposed to give the Kid his best fight until then, but not to get out in front or the knockout might not look right. That\u0027s why he held back in round four.\"\\n\\n \"But the Kid didn\u0027t know it was set up.\"\\n\\n \"Of course not. Most of his fights have been straight until tonight, but a fighter like Canelli could be dangerous to him, and why chance a bad mark on his record at this stage? He gains experience fighting Canelli and he gains confidence by beating him.\" We were on Central Park West now, heading uptown. \"The knockout was real. Canelli would have gone in the tank in the eighth, but we hoped the Kid might get us home early, and you saw him do that. What do you think of him?\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s a comer.\"\\n\\n \"I agree.\"\\n\\n \"Sometimes he telegraphs the right. In the fourth round-\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" he said. \"They\u0027ve worked with him on that. The problem is that he generally manages to get away with it.\"\\n\\n \"Well, he wouldn\u0027t have gotten by with it tonight. Not if Canelli had been looking to win.\"\\n\\n \"Yes. Well, perhaps it\u0027s as well that he wasn\u0027t.\"\\n\\n We talked boxing until we got to 104th Street, where Chance turned the car around in a careful U-turn and pulled up next to a fire hydrant. He killed the motor but left the keys. \"I\u0027ll be right down,\" he said, \"after I\u0027ve seen Sonya upstairs.\"\\n\\n She hadn\u0027t said a word since she told me it was nice to meet me. He walked around the car and opened the door for her, and they strolled to the entrance of one of the two large apartment buildings that fronted on that block. I wrote the address in my notebook. In no more than five minutes he was back behind the wheel and we were heading downtown again.\\n\\n Neither of us spoke for half a dozen blocks. Then he said, \"You wanted to talk to me. It doesn\u0027t have anything to do with Kid Bascomb, does it?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t really think so. What does it have to do with?\"\\n\\n \"Kim Dakkinen.\"\\n\\n His eyes were on the road and I couldn\u0027t see any change in his expression. He said, \"Oh? What about her?\"\\n\\n \"She wants out.\"\\n\\n \"Out? Out of what?\"\\n\\n \"The life,\" I said. \"The relationship she has with you. She wants you to agree to… break things off.\"\\n\\n We stopped for a light. He didn\u0027t say anything. The light changed and we went another block or two and he said, \"What\u0027s she to you?\"\\n\\n \"A friend.\"\\n\\n \"What does that mean? You\u0027re sleeping with her? You want to marry her? Friend\u0027s a big word, it covers a lot of ground.\"\\n\\n \"This time it\u0027s a small word. She\u0027s a friend, she asked me to do her a favor.\"\\n\\n \"By talking to me.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right.\"\\n\\n \"Why couldn\u0027t she talk to me herself? I see her frequently, you know. She wouldn\u0027t have had to run around the city asking after me. Why, I saw her just last night.\"\\n\\n \"I know.\"\\n\\n \"Do you? Why didn\u0027t she say anything when she saw me?\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s afraid.\"\\n\\n \"Afraid of me?\"\\n\\n \"Afraid you might not want her to leave.\"\\n\\n \"And so I might beat her? Disfigure her? Stub out cigarettes on her breasts?\"\\n\\n \"Something like that.\"\\n\\n He fell silent again. The car\u0027s ride was hypnotically smooth. He said, \"She can go.\"\\n\\n \"Just like that?\"\\n\\n \"How else? I\u0027m not a white slaver, you know.\" His tone put an ironic stress on the term. \"My women stay with me out of their own will, such will as they possess. They\u0027re under no duress. You know Nietzsche? \u0027Women are like dogs, the more you beat them the more they love you.\u0027 But I don\u0027t beat them, Scudder. It never seems to be necessary. How does Kim come to have you for a friend?\"\\n\\n \"We have an acquaintance in common.\"\\n\\n He glanced at me. \"You were a policeman. A detective, I believe. You left the force several years ago. You killed a child and resigned out of guilt.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/eight-million-ways-to-die-matthew-scudder-5/page-6.html","bookId":2323,"book":{"id":2323,"title":"Eight Million Ways to Die (Matthew Scudder #5)","description":"Storyline: Eight Million Ways to Die (Matthew Scudder #5) \\n Nobody knows better than Matthew Scudder how far down a person can sink in this city.
