{"id":62958,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"It struck me later that I could have stayed for the end. St. Paul\u0027s was only five minutes from my hotel. Chance would have waited. Maybe I wanted an excuse to leave before it was my turn to talk. I was in the lobby at ten o\u0027clock. I saw his car pull up and I went out the door and crossed the sidewalk to the curb. I opened the door, got in, swung it shut. He looked at me. \"That job still open?\" He nodded. \"If you want it.\" \"I want it.\" He nodded again, put the car in gear, and pulled away from the curb. Chapter 11 The circular drive in Central Park is almost exactly six miles around. We were on our fourth counterclockwise lap, the Cadillac cruising effortlessly. Chance did most of the talking. I had my notebook out, and now and then I wrote something in it. At first he talked about Kim. Her parents were Finnish immigrants who had settled on a farm in western Wisconsin. The nearest city of any size was Eau Claire. Kim had been named Kiraa and grew up milking cows and weeding the vegetable garden. When she was nine years old her older brother began abusing her sexually, coming into her room every night, doing things to her, making her do things to him. \"Except one time she told the story and it was her uncle on her mother\u0027s side, and another time it was her father, so maybe it never happened at all outside of her mind. Or maybe it did and she changed it to keep it from being so real.\" During her junior year in high school she had an affair with a middle-aged realtor. He told her he was going to leave his wife for her. She packed a suitcase and they drove to Chicago, where they stayed for three days at the Palmer House, ordering all their meals from room service. The realtor got maudlin drunk the second day and kept telling her he was ruining her life. He was in better spirits the third day, but the following morning she awoke to find him gone. A note explained that he had returned to his wife, that the room was paid for four more days, and that he would never forget Kim. Along with the note he left six hundred dollars in a hotel envelope. She stayed out the week, had a look at Chicago, and slept with several men. Two of them gave her money without being asked. She\u0027d intended to ask the others but couldn\u0027t bring herself to do so. She thought about going back to the farm. Then, on her final night at the Palmer House, she picked up a fellow hotel guest, a Nigerian delegate to some sort of trade conference. \"That burned her bridges,\" Chance said. \"Sleeping with a black man meant she couldn\u0027t go back to the farm. First thing the next morning she went and caught a bus for New York.\" She\u0027d been all wrong for the life until he took her away from Duffy and put her in her own apartment. She had the looks and the bearing for the carriage trade, and that was good because she hadn\u0027t had the hustle to make it on the street. \"She was lazy,\" he said, and thought for a moment. \"Whores are lazy.\" He\u0027d had six women working for him. Now, with Kim dead, he had five. He talked about them for a few moments in general terms, then got down to cases, supplying names and addresses and phone numbers and personal data. I made a lot of notes. We finished our fourth circuit of the park and he pulled off to the right, exited at West Seventy-second Street, drove two blocks and pulled over to the curb. \"Be a minute,\" he said. I stayed where I was while he made a call from a booth on the corner. He\u0027d left the motor idling. I looked at my notes and tried to see a pattern in the wisps and fragments I\u0027d been given. Chance returned to the car, checked the mirror, swung us around in a deft if illegal U-turn. \"Just checking with my service,\" he said. \"Just keeping in touch.\" \"You ought to have a phone in the car.\" \"Too complicated.\" He drove downtown and east, pulling up next to a fire hydrant in front of a white brick apartment house on Seventeenth between Second and Third. \"Collection time,\" he told me. Once again he left the motor idling, but this time fifteen minutes elapsed before he reappeared, striding jauntily past the liveried doorman, sliding nimbly behind the wheel. \"That\u0027s Donna\u0027s place,\" he said. \"I told you about Donna.\" \"The poet.\" \"She\u0027s all excited. She got two poems accepted by this magazine in San Francisco. She\u0027ll get six free copies of the issue the poems appear in. That\u0027s as much pay as she\u0027ll get, just copies of the magazine.\" A light turned red in front of us. He braked for it, looked left and right, then coasted through the light. \"Couple times,\" he said, \"she\u0027s had poems in magazines that pay you for them. Once she got twenty-five dollars. That\u0027s the best she ever did.\" \"It sounds like a hard way to make a living.\" \"A poet can\u0027t make any money. Whores are lazy but this one\u0027s not lazy when it comes to her poems. She\u0027ll sit for six or eight hours to get the words right, and she\u0027s always got a dozen batches of poems in the mail. They come back from one place and she sends \u0027em out someplace else. She spends more on postage than they\u0027ll ever pay her for the poems.\" He fell silent for a moment, then laughed softly. \"You know how much money I just took off of Donna? Eight hundred dollars, and that\u0027s just for the past two days. Of course there\u0027s days when her phone won\u0027t ring once.\" \"But it averages out pretty well.\" \"Pays better than poems.\" He looked at me. \"Want to go for a ride?\" \"Isn\u0027t that what we\u0027ve been doing?\" \"We been going around in circles,\" he said. \"Now I\u0027m gonna take you to a whole nother world.\" We drove down Second Avenue, through the Lower East Side, and over the Williamsburg Bridge into Brooklyn. Coming off the bridge we took enough turns to throw off my sense of direction, and the street signs didn\u0027t help much. I didn\u0027t recognize the names. But I watched the neighborhood change from Jewish to Italian to Polish and had a fair idea of where we were. On a dark, silent street of two-family frame houses, Chance slowed in front of a three-story brick structure with a garage door in the middle. He used a remote-control unit to raise the door, then closed it after we had driven in. I followed him up a flight of stairs and into a spacious high-ceilinged room. He asked if I knew where we were. I guessed Greenpoint. \"Very good,\" he said. \"I guess you know Brooklyn.\" \"I don\u0027t know this part of it very well. The meat market signs advertising kielbasa were a tip-off.\" \"I guess. Know whose house we\u0027re in? Ever hear of a Dr. Casimir Levandowski?\" \"No.\" \"No reason why you should have. He\u0027s an old fellow. Retired, confined to a wheelchair. Eccentric, too. Keeps himself to himself. This place used to be a firehouse.\" \"I thought it must have been something like that.\" \"Two architects bought it some years ago and converted it. They pretty much gutted the interior and started from scratch. They must have had a few dollars to play with because they didn\u0027t cut many corners. Look at the floors. Look at the window moldings.\" He pointed out details, commented on them. \"Then they got tired of the place or each other, I don\u0027t know what, and they sold out to old Dr. Levandowski.\" \"And he lives here?\" \"He don\u0027t exist,\" he said. His speech patterns kept shifting, from ghetto to university and back again. \"The neighbors never see the old doc. They just see his faithful black servant and all they see him do is drive in and drive out. This is my house, Matthew. Can I give you the ten-cent tour?\" It was quite a place. There was a gym on the top floor, fully equipped with weights and exercise machines and furnished with sauna and Jacuzzi. His bedroom was on the same floor, and the bed, covered with a fur spread, was centered beneath a skylight. A library on the second floor contained one whole wall of books and an eight-foot pool table. There were African masks all over the place, and occasional groups of free-standing African sculpture. Chance pointed out a piece from time to time, naming the tribe that had produced it. I mentioned having seen African masks at Kim\u0027s apartment. \"Poro Society masks,\" he said. \"From the Dan tribe. I keep one or two African things in all my girls\u0027 apartments. Not the most valuable things, of course, but not junk, either. I don\u0027t own any junk.\" He took a rather crudely fashioned mask from the wall and presented it for my inspection. The eye openings were square, the features all geometrically precise, the overall effect powerful in its primitiveness. \"This is Dogon,\" he said. \"Take hold of it. You can\u0027t appreciate sculpture with your eyes alone. The hands have to participate. Go ahead, handle it.\" I took the mask from him. Its weight was greater than I anticipated. The wood that composed it must have been very dense. He lifted a telephone from a low teakwood table and dialed a number. He said, \"Hey, darlin\u0027. Any messages?\" He listened for a moment, then put the phone down. \"Peace and quiet,\" he said, \"Shall I make some coffee?\" \"Not if it\u0027s any trouble.\" He assured me it wasn\u0027t. While the coffee brewed he told me about his African sculpture, how the craftsmen who produced it did not think of their work as art. \"Everything they make has a specific function,\" he explained. \"It\u0027s to guard your house or keep off spirits or to use in a particular tribal rite. If a mask doesn\u0027t have the power in it anymore they\u0027ll throw it away and somebody\u0027ll carve a new one. The old one\u0027s trash, you burn it up or toss it away cause it\u0027s no good.\" He laughed. \"Then the Europeans came and discovered African art. Some of those French painters got their inspiration from tribal masks. Now you\u0027ve got a situation where there are carvers in Africa spending all their time making masks and statues for export to Europe and America. They follow the old forms because that\u0027s what their customers want, but it\u0027s a funny thing. Their work\u0027s no good. It doesn\u0027t have any feeling in it. It\u0027s not real. You look at it and you take it in your hand, and you do the same with the real thing, and you can tell the difference right away. If you have any feeling at all for the stuff. Funny, isn\u0027t it?\" \"It\u0027s interesting.\" \"If I had any of the junk around I\u0027d show you, but I don\u0027t own any. I bought some when I was starting out. You have to make mistakes to develop a feel for it. But I got rid of that stuff, burned it in the fireplace there.\" He smiled. \"The very first piece I bought, I still have it. It\u0027s hanging in the bedroom. A Dan mask. Poro Society. I didn\u0027t know shit about African art but I saw it in an antique shop and I responded to the mask\u0027s artistic integrity.\" He stopped, shook his head. \"Hell I did. What happened was I looked at that piece of smooth black wood and I was looking in a mirror. I saw myself, I saw my father, I was looking back through the damned ages. You know what I\u0027m talking about?\" \"I\u0027m not sure.\" \"Hell. Maybe I don\u0027t know either.\" He gave his head a shake. \"What do you figure one of those old carvers\u0027d make of this? He\u0027d say, \u0027Shit, what\u0027s this crazy nigger want with all these old masks? Why\u0027d he go and hang \u0027em all over the damn wall?\u0027 That coffee\u0027s ready. You take yours black, right?\" He said, \"How\u0027s a detective go about detecting, anyway? Where do you start?\" \"By going around and talking to people. Unless Kim got killed coincidentally by a maniac, her death grew out of her life.\" I tapped my notebook. \"There\u0027s a lot you don\u0027t know about her life.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/eight-million-ways-to-die-matthew-scudder-5/page-14.html","bookId":2323,"book":{"id":2323,"title":"Eight Million Ways to Die (Matthew Scudder #5)","description":"Storyline: Eight Million Ways to Die (Matthew Scudder #5) Nobody knows better than Matthew Scudder how far down a person can sink in this city.
