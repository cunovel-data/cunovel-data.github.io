He walked right past them, picked up his key at the desk and went to his room.\"\\n\\n \"How could he do that?\"\\n\\n \"Easiest thing in the world,\" I said. \"He checked in the day before, just in case. He was setting things up. When he got the word that I was looking for him, he went back to my hotel, went up to his room, then went to my room and let himself in. The locks in my hotel aren\u0027t much of a challenge. He took off his clothes and sharpened his machete and waited for me to come home.\"\\n\\n \"And it almost worked.\"\\n\\n \"It should have worked. He could have waited behind the door and killed me before I knew what was happening. Or he could have stayed in the bathroom a few more minutes and given me time to get into bed. But he got too much of a kick out of killing and that\u0027s what screwed him up. He wanted us both naked when he took me out, so he waited in the bathroom, and he couldn\u0027t wait for me to get into bed because he was too keyed up, too excited. Of course if I hadn\u0027t had the gun handy he\u0027d have killed me anyway.\"\\n\\n \"He couldn\u0027t have been all alone.\"\\n\\n \"He was alone as far as the killings were concerned. He probably had partners in the emerald operation. The cops may get somewhere looking for them and they may not. Even if they do, there\u0027s no real way to make a case against anybody.\"\\n\\n He nodded. \"What happened to the brother? Kim\u0027s boyfriend, the one who started everything.\"\\n\\n \"He hasn\u0027t turned up. He\u0027s probably dead. Or he\u0027s still running, and he\u0027ll live until his Colombian friends catch up with him.\"\\n\\n \"Will they do that?\"\\n\\n \"Probably. They\u0027re supposed to be relentless.\"\\n\\n \"And that room clerk? What\u0027s his name, Calderуn?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right. Well, if he\u0027s holed up somewhere in Queens, he can read about it in the paper and ask for his old job back.\"\\n\\n He started to say something, then changed his mind and took both our cups back to the kitchen to refill them. He came back with them and gave me mine.\\n\\n \"You were up late,\" he said.\\n\\n \"All night.\"\\n\\n \"You been to sleep at all?\"\\n\\n \"Not yet.\"\\n\\n \"Myself, I doze off in a chair now and then. But when I get in bed I can\u0027t sleep, I can\u0027t even lie there. I go work out and take a sauna and a shower and drink some more coffee and sit around some more. Over and over.\"\\n\\n \"You stopped calling your service.\"\\n\\n \"I stopped calling my service. I stopped leaving the house. I guess I been eating. I take something from the refrigerator and eat it without paying attention. Kim\u0027s dead and Sunny\u0027s dead and this Cookie\u0027s dead, and maybe the brother\u0027s dead, the boyfriend, and what\u0027s-his-name is dead. The one you shot, I disremember his name.\"\\n\\n \"Marquez.\"\\n\\n \"Marquez is dead, and Calderуn disappeared, and Ruby\u0027s in San Francisco. And the question is where\u0027s Chance, and the answer is I don\u0027t know. Where I think I am is out of business.\"\\n\\n \"The girls are all right.\"\\n\\n \"So you said.\"\\n\\n \"Mary Lou isn\u0027t going to be turning tricks anymore. She\u0027s glad she did it, she learned a lot from it, but she\u0027s ready for a new stage in her life.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, well, I called that one. Didn\u0027t I tell you after the funeral?\"\\n\\n I nodded. \"And Donna thinks she can get a foundation grant, and she can earn money through readings and workshops. She says she\u0027s reached a point where selling herself is starting to undermine her poetry.\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s pretty talented, Donna. Be good if she could make it on her poetry. You say she\u0027s getting a grant?\"\\n\\n \"She thinks she\u0027s got a shot at it.\"\\n\\n He grinned. \"Aren\u0027t you gonna tell me the rest of it? Little Fran just got a Hollywood contract and she\u0027s gonna be the next Goldie Hawn.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe tomorrow,\" I said. \"For now she just wants to live in the Village and stay stoned and entertain nice men from Wall Street.\"\\n\\n \"So I still got Fran.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right.\"\\n\\n He\u0027d been pacing the floor. Now he dropped onto the hassock again. \"Be a cinch to get five, six more of them,\" he said. \"You don\u0027t know how easy it is. Easiest thing in the world.\"\\n\\n \"You told me that once before.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s the truth, man. So many women just waiting to be told what to do with their damn lives. I could walk out of here and have me a full string in no more than a week\u0027s time.\" He shook his head ruefully. \"Except for one thing.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s that?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think I can do that anymore.\" He stood up again. \"Damn, I been a good pimp! And I liked it. I tailored a life for myself and it fit me like my own skin. And you know what I went and did?\"\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"I outgrew it.\"\\n\\n \"It happens.\"\\n\\n \"Some spic goes crazy with a blade and I\u0027m out of business. You know something? It would have happened anyway, wouldn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n \"Sooner or later.\" Just as I\u0027d have left the police force even if a bullet of mine hadn\u0027t killed Estrellita Rivera. \"Lives change,\" I said. \"It doesn\u0027t seem to do much good to fight it.\"\\n\\n \"What am I gonna do?\"\\n\\n \"Whatever you want.\"\\n\\n \"Like what?\"\\n\\n \"You could go back to school.\"\\n\\n He laughed. \"And study art history? Shit, I don\u0027t want to do that. Sit in classrooms again? It was bullshit then, I went into the fuckin\u0027 army to get away from it. You know what I thought about the other night?\"\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"I was gonna build a fire. Pile all the masks in the middle of the floor, spill a little gas on \u0027em, put a match to \u0027em. Go out like one of those Vikings and take all my treasures with me. I can\u0027t say I thought about it for long. What I could do, I could sell all this shit. The house, the art, the car. I guess the money\u0027d last me a time.\"\\n\\n \"Probably.\"\\n\\n \"But then what\u0027d I do?\"\\n\\n \"Suppose you set up as a dealer?\"\\n\\n \"Are you crazy, man? Me deal drugs? I can\u0027t even pimp no more, and pimping\u0027s cleaner\u0027n dealing.\"\\n\\n \"Not drugs.\"\\n\\n \"What, then?\"\\n\\n \"The African stuff. You seem to own a lot of it and I gather the quality\u0027s high.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t own any garbage.\"\\n\\n \"So you told me. Could you use that as your stock to get you started? And do you know enough about the field to go into the business?\"\\n\\n He frowned, thinking. \"I was thinking about this earlier,\" he said.\\n\\n \"And?\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s a lot I don\u0027t know. But there\u0027s a lot I do know, plus I got a feel for it and that\u0027s something you can\u0027t get in a classroom or out of a book. But shit, you need more\u0027n that to be a dealer. You need a whole manner, a personality to go with it.\"\\n\\n \"You invented Chance, didn\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"So? Oh, I dig. I could invent some nigger art dealer same way I invented myself as a pimp.\"\\n\\n \"Couldn\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \" \u0027Course I could.\" He thought once more. \"It might work,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll have to study it.\"\\n\\n \"You got time.\"\\n\\n \"Plenty of time.\" He looked intently at me, the gold flecks glinting in his brown eyes. \"I don\u0027t know what made me hire you,\" he said. \"I swear to God I don\u0027t. If I wanted to look good or what, the superpimp avenging his dead whore. If I knew where it was going to lead-\"\\n\\n \"It probably saved a few lives,\" I said. \"If that\u0027s any consolation.\"\\n\\n \"Didn\u0027t save Kim or Sunny or Cookie.\"\\n\\n \"Kim was already dead. And Sunny killed herself and that was her choice, and Cookie was going to be killed as soon as Marquez tracked her down. But he\u0027d have gone on killing if I hadn\u0027t stopped him. The cops would have landed on him sooner or later but there\u0027d have been more dead women by then. He never would have stopped. It was too much of a turn-on for him. When he came out of the bathroom with the machete, he had an erection.\"\\n\\n \"You serious?\"\\n\\n \"Absolutely.\"\\n\\n \"He came at you with a hard-on?\"\\n\\n \"Well, I was more afraid of the machete.\"\\n\\n \"Well, yeah,\" he said. \"I could see where you would be.\"\\n\\n He wanted to give me a bonus. I told him it wasn\u0027t necessary, that I\u0027d been adequately paid for my time, but he insisted, and when people insist on giving me money I don\u0027t generally argue. I told him I\u0027d taken the ivory bracelet from Kim\u0027s apartment. He laughed and said he\u0027d forgotten all about it, that I was welcome to it and he hoped my lady would like it. It would be part of my bonus, he said, along with the cash and two pounds of his specially blended coffee.\\n\\n \"And if you like the coffee,\" he said, \"I can tell you where to get more of it.\"\\n\\n He drove me back into the city. I\u0027d have taken the subway but he insisted he had to go to Manhattan anyway to talk to Mary Lou and Donna and Fran and get things smoothed out. \"Might as well enjoy the Seville while I can,\" he said. \"Might wind up selling it to raise cash for operating expenses. Might sell the house, too.\" He shook his head. \"I swear it suits me, though. Living here.\"\\n\\n \"Get the business started with a government loan.\"\\n\\n \"You jiving?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re a minority group member. There\u0027s agencies just waiting to lend you money.\"\\n\\n \"What a notion,\" he said.\\n\\n In front of my hotel he said, \"That Colombian asshole, I still can\u0027t remember his name.\"\\n\\n \"Pedro Marquez.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s him. When he registered at your hotel, is that the name he used?\"\\n\\n \"No, it was on his ID.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s what I thought. Like he was C. O. Jones and M. A. Ricone, and I wondered what dirty word he used for you.\"\\n\\n \"He was Mr. Starudo,\" I said. \"Thomas Edward Starudo.\"\\n\\n \"T. E. Starudo? Testarudo? That a curse in Spanish?\"\\n\\n \"Not a curse. But it\u0027s a word.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s it mean?\"\\n\\n \"Stubborn,\" I said. \"Stubborn or pig-headed.\"\\n\\n \"Well,\" he said, laughing. \"Well, hell, you can\u0027t blame him for that one, can you?\"\\n\\n Chapter 34\\n\\n In my room I put the two pounds of coffee on the dresser, then went and made sure nobody was in the bathroom. I felt silly, like an old maid looking under the bed, but I figured it would be a while before I got over it. And I wasn\u0027t carrying a gun anymore. The.32 had been impounded, of course, and the official story was that Durkin had issued it to me for my protection. He hadn\u0027t even asked how I\u0027d really come by it. I don\u0027t suppose he cared.\\n\\n I sat in my chair and looked at the place on the floor where Marquez had fallen. Some of his bloodstains remained in the rug, along with traces of the chalk marks they place around dead bodies.\\n\\n I wondered if I\u0027d be able to sleep in the room. I could always get them to change it, but I\u0027d been here a few years now and I\u0027d grown accustomed to it. Chance had said it suited me, and I suppose it did.\\n\\n How did I feel about having killed him?\\n\\n I thought it over and decided I felt fine. I didn\u0027t really know anything about the son of a bitch. To understand all is to forgive all, they say, and maybe if I knew his whole story I\u0027d understand where the blood lust came from. But I didn\u0027t have to forgive him. That was God\u0027s job not mine.\\n\\n And I\u0027d been able to squeeze the trigger. And there\u0027d been no ricochets, no bad bounces, no bullets that went wide. Four shots, all in the chest. Good detective work, good decoy work, and good shooting at the end. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/eight-million-ways-to-die-matthew-scudder-5/page-48.html","bookId":2323,"book":{"id":2323,"title":"Eight Million Ways to Die (Matthew Scudder #5)","description":"Storyline: Eight Million Ways to Die (Matthew Scudder #5) \\n Nobody knows better than Matthew Scudder how far down a person can sink in this city.
