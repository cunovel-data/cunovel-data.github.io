Kim got killed and the guy who did it is still out there. Suppose he repeats?\"\\n\\n \"Kills another prostitute?\"\\n\\n \"Kills another of mine,\" he said levelly. \"Scudder, that killer\u0027s a loaded gun and I don\u0027t know who he\u0027s pointed at. Maybe killing Kim\u0027s a way for somebody to get at me. Maybe another girl of mine is next on his list. I know one thing. My business is hurting already. I told my girls not to take any hotel tricks, that\u0027s for starters, and not to take any new johns if there\u0027s anything funny about them. That\u0027s like telling them to leave the phone off the hook.\"\\n\\n The waiter drifted over with a pot of coffee and refilled our cups. I still hadn\u0027t touched my English muffin and the melted butter was starting to congeal. I got him to take it away. Chance added milk to his coffee. I remembered sitting with Kim while she drank hers heavily diluted with cream and sugar.\\n\\n I said, \"Why me, Chance?\"\\n\\n \"I told you. The cops aren\u0027t going to kill themselves. The only way somebody\u0027s going to give this his best shot is if he\u0027s earning my money for it.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s other people who work private. You could hire a whole firm, get \u0027em working around the clock.\"\\n\\n \"I never did like team sports. Rather see somebody go one on one. \u0027Sides, you got an inside track. You knew the woman.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know how much of an edge that gives me.\"\\n\\n \"And I know you.\"\\n\\n \"Because you met me once?\"\\n\\n \"And liked your style. That counts some.\"\\n\\n \"Does it? The only thing you know about me is I know how to look at a boxing match. That\u0027s not a whole lot.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s something. But I know more than that. I know how you handle yourself. And I\u0027ve asked around, you know. A lot of folks know you and most of \u0027em said good things about you.\"\\n\\n I was silent for a minute or two. Then I said, \"It could have been a psycho that killed her. That\u0027s what he made it look like so maybe that\u0027s what it was.\"\\n\\n \"Friday I learn she wants out of my string of girls. Saturday I tell her it\u0027s cool. Sunday some crazy man flies in from Indiana and chops her up, just by coincidence. You figure?\"\\n\\n \"Coincidences happen all the time,\" I said, \"but no, I don\u0027t think it was coincidence.\" God, I felt tired. I said, \"I don\u0027t much want the case.\"\\n\\n \"Why not?\"\\n\\n I thought, Because I don\u0027t want to have to do anything. I want to sit in a dark corner and turn the world off. I want a drink, damn it.\\n\\n \"You could use the money,\" he said.\\n\\n That was true enough. I hadn\u0027t gotten all that much mileage out of my last fee. And my son Mickey needed braces on his teeth, and after that there\u0027d be something else.\\n\\n I said, \"I\u0027ve got to think it over.\"\\n\\n \"All right.\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t concentrate right now. I need a little time to sort out my thoughts.\"\\n\\n \"How much time?\"\\n\\n Months, I thought. \"A couple of hours. I\u0027ll call you sometime tonight. Is there a number where I can reach you or do I just call the service?\"\\n\\n \"Pick a time,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll meet you in front of your hotel.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t have to do that.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s too easy to say no over the phone. I figure the odds are better face to face. Besides, if the answer\u0027s yes we\u0027ll want to talk some. And you\u0027ll want some money from me.\"\\n\\n I shrugged.\\n\\n \"Pick a time.\"\\n\\n \"Ten?\"\\n\\n \"In front of your hotel.\"\\n\\n \"All right,\" I said. \"If I had to answer now, it\u0027d be no.\"\\n\\n \"Then it\u0027s good you got until ten.\"\\n\\n He paid for the coffee. I didn\u0027t put up a fight.\\n\\n I went back to the hotel and up to the room. I tried to think straight and couldn\u0027t. I couldn\u0027t seem to sit still, either. I kept moving from the bed to the chair and back again, wondering why I hadn\u0027t given him a final no right away. Now I had the aggravation of getting through the hours until ten o\u0027clock and then finding the resolve to turn down what he was offering.\\n\\n Without thinking too much about what I was doing I put on my hat and coat and went around the corner to Armstrong\u0027s. I walked in the door not knowing what I was going to order. I went up to the bar and Billie started shaking his head when he saw me coming. He said, \"I can\u0027t serve you, Matt. I\u0027m sorry as hell.\"\\n\\n I felt the color mounting in my face. I was embarrassed and I was angry. I said, \"What are you talking about? Do I look drunk to you?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Then how the hell did I get to be eighty-six around here?\"\\n\\n His eyes avoided mine. \"I don\u0027t make the rules,\" he said. \"I\u0027m not saying you\u0027re not welcome here. Coffee or a Coke or a meal, hell, you\u0027re a valued longtime customer. But I\u0027m not allowed to sell you booze.\"\\n\\n \"Who says?\"\\n\\n \"The boss says. When you were in here the other night-\"\\n\\n Oh, God. I said, \"I\u0027m sorry about that, Billie. I\u0027ll tell you the truth, I had a couple of bad nights. I didn\u0027t even know I came in here.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t worry about it.\"\\n\\n Christ, I wanted to hide behind something. \"Was I very bad, Billie? Did I make trouble?\"\\n\\n \"Aw, shit,\" he said. \"You were drunk, you know? It happens, right? I used to have this Irish landlady, I came in bagged one night and apologized the next day, and she would say, \u0027Jaysus, son, it could happen to a bishop.\u0027 You didn\u0027t make any trouble, Matt.\"\\n\\n \"Then-\"\\n\\n \"Look,\" he said, and leaned forward. \"I\u0027ll just repeat what I was told. He told me, he said, if the guy wants to drink himself to death I can\u0027t stop him, and if he wants to come in here he\u0027s welcome, but I\u0027m not selling him the booze. This isn\u0027t me talking, Matt. I\u0027m just saying what was said.\"\\n\\n \"I understand.\"\\n\\n \"If it was up to me-\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t come in for a drink anyway,\" I said. \"I came in for coffee.\"\\n\\n \"In that case-\"\\n\\n \"In that case the hell with it,\" I said. \"In that case I think what I want is a drink and it shouldn\u0027t be all that hard to find somebody willing to sell it to me.\"\\n\\n \"Matt, don\u0027t take it that way.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t tell me how to take it,\" I said. \"Don\u0027t give me that shit.\"\\n\\n There was something clean and satisfying about the rage I felt. I stalked out of there, my anger burning with a pure flame, and stood on the sidewalk trying to decide where to go for a drink.\\n\\n Then someone was calling my name.\\n\\n I turned. A fellow in an army jacket was smiling gently at me. I couldn\u0027t place him at first. He said it was good to see me and asked how I was doing, and then of course I knew who it was.\\n\\n I said, \"Oh, hi, Jim. I\u0027m okay, I guess.\"\\n\\n \"Going to the meeting? I\u0027ll walk with you.\"\\n\\n \"Oh,\" I said. \"Gee, I don\u0027t think I\u0027m going to be able to make it tonight. I have to see a guy.\"\\n\\n He just smiled. Something clicked, and I asked him if his last name was Faber.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right,\" he said.\\n\\n \"You called me at the hotel.\"\\n\\n \"Just wanted to say hello. Nothing important.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t recognize the name. Otherwise I would have called you back.\"\\n\\n \"Sure. You sure you don\u0027t want to tag along to the meeting, Matt?\"\\n\\n \"I wish I could. Oh, Jesus.\"\\n\\n He waited.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve been having a little trouble, Jim.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not so unusual, you know.\"\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t look at him. I said, \"I started drinking again. I went, I don\u0027t know, seven or eight days. Then I started again, and I was doing okay, you know, controlling it, and then one night I got into trouble.\"\\n\\n \"You got in trouble when you picked up the first one.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. Maybe.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s why I called,\" he said gently. \"I figured maybe you could use a little help.\"\\n\\n \"You knew?\"\\n\\n \"Well, you were in pretty rocky shape at the meeting Monday night.\"\\n\\n \"I was at the meeting?\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t remember, do you? I had a feeling you were in a blackout.\"\\n\\n \"Oh my God.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s the matter?\"\\n\\n \"I went there drunk? I showed up drunk at an AA meeting?\"\\n\\n He laughed. \"You make it sound like a mortal sin. You think you\u0027re the first person who ever did that?\"\\n\\n I wanted to die. \"But it\u0027s terrible,\" I said.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s so terrible?\"\\n\\n \"I can never go back. I can never walk into that room.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re ashamed of yourself, aren\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"Of course.\"\\n\\n He nodded. \"I was always ashamed of my blackouts. I didn\u0027t want to know about them and I was always afraid of what I might have done. Just for the record, you weren\u0027t so bad. You didn\u0027t make trouble. You didn\u0027t talk out of turn. You spilled a cup of coffee-\"\\n\\n \"Oh, God.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not as if you spilled it on anybody. You were just drunk, that\u0027s all. In case you were wondering, you didn\u0027t look to be having a very good time. Matter of fact, you looked pretty miserable.\"\\n\\n I found the courage to say, \"I wound up in the hospital.\"\\n\\n \"And you\u0027re out already?\"\\n\\n \"I signed myself out this afternoon. I had a convulsion, that\u0027s how I got there.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027ll do it.\"\\n\\n We walked a little ways in silence. I said, \"I wouldn\u0027t be able to stay for the whole meeting. I have to meet a guy at ten o\u0027clock.\"\\n\\n \"You could stay for most of the meeting.\"\\n\\n \"I guess so.\"\\n\\n It seemed to me as though everybody was staring at me. Some people said hello to me and I found myself reading implications into their greetings. Others didn\u0027t say anything and I decided they were avoiding me because my drunkenness had offended them. I was so maddeningly self-conscious I wanted to jump out of my own skin.\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t stay in my seat during the qualification. I kept going back to the coffee urn. I was sure my constant visits to the urn were drawing disapproval but I seemed irresistibly drawn to it.\\n\\n My mind kept going off on tangents of its own. The speaker was a Brooklyn fireman and he had a very lively story but I couldn\u0027t keep my mind on it. He told how everyone in his firehouse had been a heavy drinker and how anyone who didn\u0027t drink that way got transferred out. \"The captain was an alcoholic and he wanted to surround himself with other alcoholics,\" he explained. \"He used to say, \u0027Give me enough drunken firemen and I\u0027ll put out any fire there is.\u0027 And he was right. Man, we would do anything, we would go in anywhere, take any crazy goddamned chances. Because we were too drunk to know better.\"\\n\\n It was such a goddamned puzzle. I\u0027d been controlling my drinking and it had worked fine. Except when it didn\u0027t.\\n\\n On the break I put a buck in the basket and went to the urn for still another cup of coffee. This time I managed to make myself eat an oatmeal cookie. I was back in my seat when the discussion started.\\n\\n I kept losing the thread but it didn\u0027t seem to matter. I listened as well as I could and I stayed there as long as I could. At a quarter of ten I got up and slipped out the door as unobtrusively as possible. I had the feeling every eye in the place was on me and I wanted to assure them all that I wasn\u0027t going for a drink, that I had to meet somebody, that it was a business matter. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/eight-million-ways-to-die-matthew-scudder-5/page-13.html","bookId":2323,"book":{"id":2323,"title":"Eight Million Ways to Die (Matthew Scudder #5)","description":"Storyline: Eight Million Ways to Die (Matthew Scudder #5) \\n Nobody knows better than Matthew Scudder how far down a person can sink in this city.
