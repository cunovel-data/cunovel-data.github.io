I got a desk full of shit I haven\u0027t got time for and you\u0027ve got me pulling my chain with this one.\"\n \"Think how good you\u0027ll look if it breaks.\"\n \"I get the glory, huh?\"\n \"Somebody might as well.\"\n I had three more hookers to call, Sunny and Ruby and Mary Lou. Their numbers were in my notebook. But I\u0027d talked to enough whores for one day. I called Chance\u0027s service, left word for him to call me. It was Friday night. Maybe he was at the Garden, watching a couple of boys hit each other. Or did he just go when Kid Bascomb was fighting?\n I took out Donna Campion\u0027s poem and read it. In my mind\u0027s eye all the poem\u0027s colors were overlaid with blood, bright arterial blood that faded from scarlet to rust. I reminded myself that Kim had been alive when the poem was written. Why, then, did I sense a note of doom in Donna\u0027s lines? Had she picked up on something? Or was I seeing things that weren\u0027t really there?\n She\u0027d left out the gold of Kim\u0027s hair. Unless the sun was supposed to cover that base. I saw those gold braids wrapped around her head and thought of Jan Keane\u0027s Medusa. Without giving it too much thought I picked up the phone and placed a call. I hadn\u0027t dialed the number in a long time but memory supplied it, pushing it at me as a magician forces a card on one.\n It rang four times. I was going to hang up when I heard her voice, low pitched, out of breath.\n I said, \"Jan, it\u0027s Matt Scuddder.\"\n \"Matt! I was just thinking of you not an hour ago. Give me a minute, I just walked in the door, let me get my coat offâ€¦ There. How\u0027ve you been? It\u0027s so good to hear from you.\"\n \"I\u0027ve been all right. And you?\"\n \"Oh, things are going well. A day at a time.\"\n The little catchphrases. \"Still going to those meetings?\"\n \"Uh-huh. I just came from one, as a matter of fact. How are you doing?\"\n \"Not so bad.\"\n \"That\u0027s good.\"\n What was it, Friday? Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. \"I\u0027ve got three days,\" I said.\n \"Matt, that\u0027s wonderful!\"\n What was so wonderful about it? \"I suppose,\" I said.\n \"Have you been going to meetings?\"\n \"Sort of. I\u0027m not sure I\u0027m ready for all that.\"\n We talked a little. She said maybe we\u0027d run into each other at a meeting one of these days. I allowed that it was possible. She\u0027d been sober almost six months, she\u0027d qualified a couple of times already. I said it would be interesting sometime to hear her story. She said, \"Hear it? God, you\u0027re in it.\"\n She was just getting back to sculpture. She\u0027d put it all on hold when she got sober, and it was hard to make the clay do what she wanted it to do. But she was working at it, trying to keep it all in perspective, putting her sobriety first and letting the rest of her life fall into shape at its own pace.\n And what about me? Well, I said, I had a case, I was looking into a matter for an acquaintance. I didn\u0027t go into detail and she didn\u0027t press. The conversation slowed, and there were a few pauses in it, and I said, \"Well, I just thought I\u0027d call and say hello.\"\n \"I\u0027m glad you did, Matthew.\"\n \"Maybe we\u0027ll run into each other one of these days.\"\n \"I\u0027d like that.\"\n I hung up and remembered drinking in her loft on Lispenard Street, warming and mellowing as the booze worked its magic in our veins. What a fine sweet evening that had been.\n At meetings you\u0027ll hear people say, \"My worst day sober is better than my best day drunk.\" And everybody nods like a plastic dog on a Puerto Rican\u0027s dashboard. I thought about that night with Jan and looked around my little cell of a room and tried to figure out why this night was better than the other had been.\n I looked at my watch. The liquor stores were closed. The bars, though, would be open for hours yet.\n I stayed where I was. Outside, a squad car went by with its siren open. The sound died down, the minutes slipped by, and my phone rang.\n It was Chance. \"You been working,\" he said with approval. \"I\u0027ve been getting reports. The girls cooperate okay?\"\n \"They\u0027ve been fine.\"\n \"You getting anywhere?\"\n \"It\u0027s hard to tell. You pick up a piece here and a piece there and you never know if they\u0027re going to fit together. What did you take from Kim\u0027s apartment?\"\n \"Just some money. Why?\"\n \"How much?\"\n \"Couple hundred. She kept cash in the top dresser drawer. It was no secret hiding place, just where she kept it. I looked around some to see if she had any holdout money stashed anywhere, but I couldn\u0027t find any. Didn\u0027t turn up any bank-books, safe-deposit keys. Did you?\"\n \"No.\"\n \"Or any money? S\u0027pose it\u0027s finders keepers if you did, but I\u0027m just asking.\"\n \"No money. That\u0027s all you took?\"\n \"And a picture a nightclub photographer took of her and me. Couldn\u0027t see any rightful reason to leave that for the police. Why?\"\n \"I just wondered. You went there before the police picked you up?\"\n \"They didn\u0027t pick me up. I walked in voluntarily. And yes, I went there first, and it was before they got there, far as that goes. Or the couple hundred would have been gone.\"\n Maybe, maybe not. I said, \"Did you take the cat?\"\n \"The cat?\"\n \"She had a little black kitten.\"\n \"Right, she did. I never thought about the kitten. No, I didn\u0027t take it. I would have put out food for it if I thought. Why? Is it gone?\"\n I said it was, and its litter box too. I asked if the kitten had been around when he went to the apartment but he didn\u0027t know. He hadn\u0027t noticed a kitten, but then he hadn\u0027t been looking for one.\n \"And I was moving quickly, you know. I was in and out in five minutes. Kitten could have brushed against my ankles and I might not have paid it any mind. What\u0027s it matter? Kitten didn\u0027t kill her.\"\n \"No.\"\n \"You don\u0027t think she took the kitten to the hotel, do you?\"\n \"Why would she do that?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know, man. I don\u0027t know why we\u0027re talking about the kitten.\"\n \"Somebody must have taken it. Somebody besides you must have gone to her apartment after she died and took the kitten out of there.\"\n \"You sure the kitten wasn\u0027t there today? Animals get scared when a stranger comes around. They hide.\"\n \"The kitten wasn\u0027t there.\"\n \"Could have walked out when the cops came. Doors open, kitten runs out, goodbye kitty.\"\n \"I never heard of a cat taking its litter pan along.\"\n \"Maybe some neighbor took it. Heard it meowing, like they do, and didn\u0027t want it to go hungry.\"\n \"Some neighbor with a key?\"\n \"Some people exchange keys with a neighbor. In case they get locked out. Or the neighbor could have got the key from the doorman.\"\n \"That\u0027s probably what happened.\"\n \"Must be.\"\n \"I\u0027ll check with the neighbors tomorrow.\"\n He whistled softly. \"You chase down everything, don\u0027t you? Little thing like a kitten, you\u0027re at it like a dog at a bone.\"\n \"That\u0027s the way it\u0027s done. Goyakod.\"\n \"How\u0027s that?\"\n \"Goyakod,\" I said, and spelled it out. \"It stands for Get Off Your Ass and Knock On Doors.\"\n \"Oh, I like that. Say it again?\"\n I said it again.\n \" \u0027Get off your ass and knock on doors.\u0027 I like that.\"\n Chapter 18\n Saturday was a good day for knocking on doors. It usually is because more people are at home than during the week. This Saturday the weather didn\u0027t invite them out. A fine rain was falling out of a dark sky and there was a stiff wind blowing, whipping the rain around.\n Wind sometimes behaves curiously in New York. The tall buildings seem to break it up and put a spin on it, like English on a billiard ball, so that it takes odd bounces and blows in different directions on different blocks. That morning and afternoon it seemed to be always in my face. I would turn a corner and it would turn with me, always coming at me, always driving the spray of rain at me. There were moments when I found it invigorating, others when I hunched my shoulders and lowered my head and cursed the wind and the rain and myself for being out in them.\n My first stop was Kim\u0027s building, where I nodded and walked past the doorman, key in hand. I hadn\u0027t seen him before and I doubt that I was any more familiar to him than he was to me, but he didn\u0027t challenge my right to be there. I rode upstairs and let myself into Kim\u0027s apartment.\n Maybe I was making sure the cat was still missing. I had no other reason to go in. The apartment was as I had left it, as far as I could tell, and I couldn\u0027t find a kitten or a litter pan anywhere. While I thought of it I checked the kitchen. There were no cans or boxes of cat food in the cupboards, no bag of kitty litter, no nonspill bowl for a cat to eat out of. I couldn\u0027t detect any cat odor in the apartment, and I was beginning to wonder if my memory of the animal might have been a false one. Then, in the refrigerator, I found a half-full can of Puss \u0027n Boots topped with a plastic lid.\n How about that, I thought. The great detective found a clue.\n Not long after that the great detective found a cat. I walked up and down the hallway and knocked on doors. Not everyone was home, rainy Saturday or no, and the first three people who were had no idea that Kim had ever owned a cat, let alone any information on its present whereabouts.\n The fourth door that opened to my knock belonged to an Alice Simkins, a small woman in her fifties whose conversation was guarded until I mentioned Kim\u0027s cat.\n \"Oh, Panther,\" she said. \"You\u0027ve come for Panther. You know, I was afraid someone would. Come in, won\u0027t you?\"\n She led me to an upholstered chair, brought me a cup of coffee, and apologized for the excess of furniture in the room. She was a widow, she told me, and had moved to this small apartment from a suburban house, and while she\u0027d rid herself of a great many things she\u0027d made the mistake of keeping too much furniture.\n \"It\u0027s like an obstacle course in here,\" she said, \"and it\u0027s not as if I just moved in yesterday. I\u0027ve been here almost two years. But because there\u0027s no real urgency I seem to find it all too easy to put it off and put it off.\"\n She had heard about Kim\u0027s death from someone in the building. The following morning she was at her desk at the office when she thought of Kim\u0027s cat. Who would feed it? Who would take care of it?\n \"I made myself wait until lunch hour,\" she said, \"because I decided I just wasn\u0027t crazy enough to run out of the office lest a kitten go an extra hour without food. I fed the kitten and cleaned out the litter pan and freshened its water, and I checked on it that evening when I came home from the office, and it was evident that no one had been in to care for it. I thought about the poor little thing that night, and the next morning when I went to feed it I decided it might as well live with me for the time being.\" She smiled. \"It seems to have adjusted. Do you suppose it misses her?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know.\"\n \"I don\u0027t suppose it\u0027ll miss me, either, but I\u0027ll miss it. I never kept a cat before. We had dogs years ago. I don\u0027t think I\u0027d want to keep a dog, not in the city, but a cat doesn\u0027t seem to be any trouble. Panther was declawed so there\u0027s no problem of furniture scratching, although I almost wish he\u0027d scratched some of this furniture, it might move me to get rid of it.\" She laughed softly. \"I\u0027m afraid I took all his food from her apartment. I can get all of that together for you. And Panther\u0027s hiding somewhere, but I\u0027m sure I can find him.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/eight-million-ways-to-die-matthew-scudder-5/page-24.html","bookId":2323,"book":{"id":2323,"title":"Eight Million Ways to Die (Matthew Scudder #5)","description":"Storyline: \n Eight Million Ways to Die (Matthew Scudder #5) \n Nobody knows better than Matthew Scudder how far down a person can sink in this city.
