{"id":62965,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"\"I guessed that.\" \"Why? Do I seem stoned?\" \"The smell.\" \"Oh, right. I don\u0027t smell it because I\u0027m here, but when I go out and then I come back in, whew! It\u0027s like a friend of mine has four cats and she swears they don\u0027t smell, but the smell could knock you down. It\u0027s just that she\u0027s used to it.\" She shifted in her seat. \"Do you ever smoke, Matt?\" \"No.\" \"You don\u0027t drink and you don\u0027t smoke, that\u0027s terrific. Can I get you another diet soda?\" \"No thanks.\" \"Are you sure? Look, would it bother you if I smoked a quick joint? Just to unwind a little.\" \"Go ahead.\" \"Because I\u0027ve got this fellow coming over and it\u0027ll help me be in the mood.\" I told her it was fine with me. She fetched a plastic baggie of marijuana from a shelf over the stove and hand-rolled a cigarette with evident expertise. \"He\u0027ll probably want to smoke,\" she said, and manufactured two more cigarettes. She lit one, put everything else away, and returned to the sling chair. She smoked the joint all the way down, chattering about her life between drags, finally stubbing the tiny roach and setting it aside for later. Her manner didn\u0027t change visibly for having smoked the thing. Perhaps she\u0027d been smoking throughout the day and had been stoned when I arrived. Perhaps she just didn\u0027t show the effects of the drug, as some drinkers don\u0027t show their drinks. I asked if Chance smoked when he came to see her and she laughed at the idea. \"He never drinks, never smokes. Same as you. Hey, is that where you know him from? Do you both hang out in a nonbar together? Or maybe you both have the same undealer.\" I managed to get the conversation back to Kim. If Chance didn\u0027t care for Kim, did Fran think she might have been seeing someone else?\" \"He didn\u0027t care for her,\" she said. \"You know something? I\u0027m the only one he loves.\" I could taste the grass in her speech now. Her voice was the same, but her mind made different connections, switching along paths of smoke. \"Do you think Kim had a boyfriend?\" \"I have boyfriends. Kim had tricks. All of the others have tricks.\" \"If Kim had someone special-\" \"Sure, I can dig it. Somebody who wasn\u0027t a john, and that\u0027s why she wanted to split with Chance. That what you mean?\" \"It\u0027s possible.\" \"And then he killed her.\" \"Chance?\" \"Are you crazy? Chance never cared enough about her to kill her. You know how long it\u0027d take to replace her? Shit.\" \"You mean the boyfriend killed her.\" \"Sure.\" \"Why?\" \" \u0027Cause he\u0027s on the spot. She leaves Chance, there she is, all ready for happily ever after, and what does he want with that? I mean he\u0027s got a wife, he\u0027s got a job, he\u0027s got a family, he\u0027s got a house in Scarsdale-\" \"How do you know all this?\" She sighed. \"I\u0027m just speedballing, baby. I\u0027m just throwing chalk at the blackboard. Can you dig it? He\u0027s a married guy, he digs Kim, it\u0027s kicky being in love with a hooker and having her in love with you, and that way you get it for free, but you don\u0027t want anybody turning your life around. She says, Hey, I\u0027m free now, time to ditch your wife and we\u0027ll run into the sunset, and the sunset\u0027s something he watches from the terrace at the country club and he wants to keep it that way. Next thing you know, zip, she\u0027s dead and he\u0027s back in Larchmont.\" \"It was Scarsdale a minute ago.\" \"Whatever.\" \"Who would he be, Fran?\" \"The boyfriend? I don\u0027t know. Anybody.\" \"A john?\" \"You don\u0027t fall in love with a john.\" \"Where would she meet a guy? And what kind of guy would she meet?\" She struggled with the notion, shrugged and gave up. The conversation never got any further than that. I used her phone, talked for a moment, then wrote my name and number on a pad next to the phone. \"In case you think of anything,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll call you if I do. You going? You sure you don\u0027t want another soda?\" \"No thanks.\" \"Well,\" she said. She came over to me, stifled a lazy yawn with the back of her hand, looked up at me through the long lashes. \"Hey, I\u0027m really glad you could come over,\" she said. \"Anytime you feel like company, you know, give me a call, okay? Just to hang out and talk.\" \"Sure.\" \"I\u0027d like that,\" she said softly, coming up onto her toes, planting an astonishing kiss on my cheek. \"I\u0027d really like that, Matt,\" she said. Halfway down the stairs I started laughing. How automatically she\u0027d slipped into her whore\u0027s manner, warm and earnest at parting, and how good she was at it. No wonder those stockbrokers didn\u0027t mind climbing all those stairs. No wonder they turned out to watch her try to be an actress. The hell, she was an actress, and not a bad one, either. Two blocks away I could still feel the imprint of her kiss on my cheek. Chapter 16 Donna Campion\u0027s apartment was on the tenth floor of the white brick building on East Seventeenth Street. The living-room window faced west, and the sun was making one of its intermittent appearances when I got there. Sunlight flooded the room. There were plants everywhere, all of them vividly green and thriving, plants on the floor and the windowsills, plants hanging in the window, plants on ledges and tables throughout the room. The sunlight streamed through the curtain of plants and cast intricate patterns on the dark parquet flooring. I sat in a wicker armchair and sipped a cup of black coffee. Donna was perched sideways on a backed oak bench about four feet wide. It had been a church pew, she\u0027d told me, and it was English oak, Jacobite or possibly Elizabethan, dark with the passing years and worn smooth by three or four centuries of pious bottoms. Some vicar in rural Devon had decided to redecorate and in due course she\u0027d bought the little pew at a University Place auction gallery. She had the face to go with it, a long face that tapered from a high broad forehead to a pointed chin. Her skin was very pale, as if the only sunlight she ever got was what passed through the screen of plants. She was wearing a crisp white blouse with a Peter Pan collar and a short pleated skirt of gray flannel over a pair of black tights. Her slippers were doeskin, with pointed toes. A long narrow nose, a small thin-lipped mouth. Dark brown hair, shoulder length, combed straight back from a well-defined widow\u0027s peak. Circles under her eyes, tobacco stains on two fingers of her right hand. No nail polish, no jewelry, no visible makeup. No prettiness, certainly, but a medieval quality that came quite close to beauty. She didn\u0027t look like any whore I\u0027d ever met. She did look like a poet, though, or what I thought a poet ought to look like. She said, \"Chance said to give you my complete cooperation. He said you\u0027re trying to find out who killed the Dairy Queen.\" \"The Dairy Queen?\" \"She looked like a beauty queen, and then I learned she was from Wisconsin, and I thought of all that robust milk-fed innocence. She was a sort of regal milkmaid.\" She smiled softly. \"That\u0027s my imagination talking. I didn\u0027t really know her.\" \"Did you ever meet her boyfriend?\" \"I didn\u0027t know she had one.\" Nor had she known that Kim had been planning to leave Chance, and she seemed to find the information interesting. \"I wonder,\" she said. \"Was she an emigrant or an immigrant?\" \"What do you mean?\" \"Was she going from or to? It\u0027s a matter of emphasis. When I first came to New York I was coming to. I\u0027d also just made a break with my family and the town I grew up in, but that was secondary. Later on, when I split with my husband, I was running from. The act of leaving was more important than the destination.\" \"You were married?\" \"For three years. Well, together for three years. Lived together for one year, married for two.\" \"How long ago was that?\" \"Four years?\" She worked it out. \"Five years this coming spring. Although I\u0027m still married, technically. I never bothered to get a divorce. Do you think I should?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"I probably ought to. Just to tie off a loose end.\" \"How long have you been with Chance?\" \"Going on three years. Why?\" \"You don\u0027t seem the type.\" \"Is there a type? I don\u0027t suppose I\u0027m much like Kim. Neither regal nor a milkmaid.\" She laughed. \"I don\u0027t know which is which, but we\u0027re like the colonel\u0027s lady and Judy O\u0027Grady.\" \"Sisters under the skin?\" She looked surprised that I\u0027d recognized the quotation. She said, \"After I left my husband I was living on the Lower East Side. Do you know Norfolk Street? Between Stanton and Rivington?\" \"Not specifically.\" \"I knew it very specifically. I lived there and I had these little jobs in the neighborhood. I worked in a Laundromat, I waited tables. I clerked in shops. I would quit the jobs or the jobs would quit me and there was never enough money and I hated where I was living and I was starting to hate my life. I was going to call my husband and ask him to take me back just so he would take care of me. I kept thinking about it. One time I dialed his number but the line was busy.\" And so she\u0027d drifted almost accidentally into selling herself. There was a store owner down the block who kept coming on to her. One day without preplanning it she heard herself say, \"Look, if you really want to ball me, would you give me twenty dollars?\" He\u0027d been flustered, blurting that he hadn\u0027t known she was a hooker. \"I\u0027m not,\" she told him, \"but I need the money. And I\u0027m supposed to be a pretty good fuck.\" She started turning a few tricks a week. She moved from Norfolk Street to a better block in the same neighborhood, then moved again to Ninth Street just east of Tompkins Square. She didn\u0027t have to work now but there were other hassles to contend with. She was beaten up once, robbed several times. Again she found herself thinking of calling her ex-husband. Then she met a girl in the neighborhood who worked in a midtown massage parlor. Donna tried out there and liked the security of it. There was a man in front to deal with anyone who tried to cause trouble, and the work itself was mechanical, almost clinical in its detachment. Virtually all her tricks were manual or oral. Her own flesh was uninvaded, and there was no illusion of intimacy beyond the pure fact of physical intimacy. At first she welcomed this. She saw herself as a sexual technician, a kind of physiotherapist. Then it turned on her. \"The place had Mafia vibes,\" she said, \"and you could smell death in the drapes and carpets. And it got like a job, I worked regular hours, I took the subway back and forth. It sucked- I love that word- it sucked the poetry right out of me.\" And so she\u0027d quit and resumed freelancing, and somewhere along the way Chance found her and everything fell into place. He\u0027d installed her in this apartment, the first decent place she ever had in New York, and he got her phone number circulating and took all the hassles away. Her bills got paid, her apartment got cleaned, everything got done for her, and all she had to do was work on her poems and mail them off to magazines and be nice and charming whenever the telephone rang. \"Chance takes all the money you earn,\" I said. \"Doesn\u0027t that bother you?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/eight-million-ways-to-die-matthew-scudder-5/page-21.html","bookId":2323,"book":{"id":2323,"title":"Eight Million Ways to Die (Matthew Scudder #5)","description":"Storyline: Eight Million Ways to Die (Matthew Scudder #5) Nobody knows better than Matthew Scudder how far down a person can sink in this city.
