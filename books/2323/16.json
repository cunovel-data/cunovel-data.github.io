{"id":62960,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"\"Matt, he wanted to see me in the city. We weren\u0027t telling each other it was love, nothing like that, but there was this sense that we might have something that might go somewhere, and he wanted to follow it up and see where it led. He lives in Merrick. You know where that is?\"\n \"Sure, out on the Island. It\u0027s not that far from where I used to live.\"\n \"Is it nice out there?\"\n \"Parts of it are very nice.\"\n \"I gave him a phony number. He knows my name but the phone here is unlisted. I haven\u0027t heard from him and I don\u0027t expect to. I wanted a week in the sun and a nice little romance, and that\u0027s what I had, but once in a while I think I could call him and make up something about the wrong number. I could lie my way out of that one.\"\n \"Probably.\"\n \"But for what? I could even lie my way into being his wife or girlfriend or something. And I could give up this apartment and drop my john book in the incinerator. But for what?\" She looked at me. \"I\u0027ve got a good life. I save my money. I always saved my money.\"\n \"And invested it,\" I remembered. \"Real estate, isn\u0027t it? Apartment houses in Queens?\"\n \"Not just Queens. I could retire now if I had to and I\u0027d get by all right. But why would I want to retire and what do I need with a boyfriend?\"\n \"Why did Kim Dakkinen want to retire?\"\n \"Is that what she wanted?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know. Why did she want to leave Chance?\"\n She thought it over, shook her head. \"I never asked.\"\n \"Neither did I.\"\n \"I\u0027ve never been able to understand why a girl would have a pimp in the first place, so I don\u0027t need an explanation when somebody tells me she wants to get rid of one.\"\n \"Was she in love with anybody?\"\n \"Kim? Could be. She didn\u0027t mention it if she was.\"\n \"Was she planning to leave the city?\"\n \"I didn\u0027t get that impression. But she wouldn\u0027t tell me if she was, would she?\"\n \"Hell,\" I said. I put my empty cup on the end table. \"She was involved someway with someone. I just wish I knew who.\"\n \"Why?\"\n \"Because that\u0027s the only way I\u0027m going to find out who killed her.\"\n \"You think that\u0027s how it works?\"\n \"That\u0027s usually how it works.\"\n \"Suppose I got killed tomorrow. What would you do?\"\n \"I guess I\u0027d send flowers.\"\n \"Seriously.\"\n \"Seriously? I\u0027d check tax lawyers from Merrick.\"\n \"There\u0027s probably a few of them, don\u0027t you think?\"\n \"Could be. I don\u0027t suppose there\u0027s too many who spent a week in Barbados this month. You said he stayed at the next hotel down the beach from you? I don\u0027t think he\u0027d be hard to find, or that I\u0027d have much trouble tying him to you.\"\n \"Would you actually do all that?\"\n \"Why not?\"\n \"No one would be paying you.\"\n I laughed. \"Well, you and I, we go back a ways, Elaine.\"\n And we did. When I was on the force we\u0027d had an arrangement. I helped her out when she needed the kind of hand a cop could provide, whether with the law or with an unruly john. She, in turn, had been available to me when I wanted her. What, I wondered suddenly, had that made me? Neither pimp nor boyfriend, but what?\n \"Matt? Why did Chance hire you?\"\n \"To find out who killed her.\"\n \"Why?\"\n I thought of the reasons he\u0027d given. \"I don\u0027t know,\" I said.\n \"Why\u0027d you take the job?\"\n \"I can use the money, Elaine.\"\n \"You don\u0027t care that much about money.\"\n \"Sure I do. It\u0027s time I started providing for my old age. I\u0027ve got an eye on these apartment houses in Queens.\"\n \"Very funny.\"\n \"I\u0027ll bet you\u0027re some landlady. I\u0027ll bet they love it when you come around to collect the rent.\"\n \"There\u0027s a management firm that takes care of all that. I never see my tenants.\"\n \"I wish you hadn\u0027t told me that. You just ruined a great fantasy.\"\n \"I\u0027ll bet.\"\n I said, \"Kim took me to bed after I finished the job for her. I went over there and she paid me and then afterward we went to bed.\"\n \"And?\"\n \"It was like a tip, almost. A friendly way of saying thank you.\"\n \"Beats ten dollars at Christmas time.\"\n \"But would she do that? If she was involved with somebody, I mean. Would she just go to bed with me for the hell of it?\"\n \"Matt, you\u0027re forgetting something.\"\n She looked, for just a moment, like somebody\u0027s wise old aunt. I asked what I was forgetting.\n \"Matt, she was a hooker.\"\n \"Were you a hooker in Barbados?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" she said. \"Maybe I was and maybe I wasn\u0027t. But I can tell you this much. I was damn glad when the mating dance was over and we were in bed together because for a change I knew what I was doing. And going to bed with guys is what I do.\"\n I thought a moment. Then I said, \"When I called earlier you said to give you an hour. Not to come over right away.\"\n \"So?\"\n \"Because you had a john booked?\"\n \"Well, it wasn\u0027t the meter reader.\"\n \"Did you need the money?\"\n \"Did I need the money? What kind of question is that? I took the money.\"\n \"But you would have made the rent without it.\"\n \"And I wouldn\u0027t have missed any meals, or had to wear the panty hose with the runs in it. What\u0027s this all about?\"\n \"So you saw the guy today because that\u0027s what you do.\"\n \"I suppose.\"\n \"Well, you\u0027re the one who asked why I took the job.\"\n \"It\u0027s what you do,\" she said.\n \"Something like that.\"\n She thought of something and laughed. She said, \"When Heinrich Heine was dying- the German poet?\"\n \"Yeah?\"\n \"When he was dying he said, \u0027God will pardon me. It\u0027s His profession.\u0027 \"\n \"That\u0027s not bad.\"\n \"It\u0027s probably even better in German. I shtup and you detect and God pardons.\" She lowered her eyes. \"I just hope He does,\" she said. \"When it\u0027s my turn in the barrel, I hope He\u0027s not down in Barbados for the weekend.\"\n Chapter 13\n When I left Elaine\u0027s the sky was growing dark and the streets were thick with rush-hour traffic. It was raining again, a nagging drizzle that slowed the commuters to a crawl. I looked at the swollen river of cars and wondered if one of them held Elaine\u0027s tax lawyer. I thought about him and tried to guess how he might have reacted when the number she gave him turned out to be a fake.\n He could find her if he wanted to. He knew her name. The phone company wouldn\u0027t give out her unlisted number, but he wouldn\u0027t have to be too well connected to find somebody who could pry it out of them for him. Failing that, he could trace her without too much trouble through her hotel. They could tell him her travel agent and somewhere along the line he could pick up her address. I\u0027d been a cop, I automatically thought of this sort of thing, but couldn\u0027t anybody make this sort of connection? It didn\u0027t seem terribly complicated to me.\n Perhaps he\u0027d been hurt when her number proved phony. Perhaps knowing she didn\u0027t want to see him would keep him from wanting to see her. But wouldn\u0027t his first thought be that the mistake might have been an accident? Then he\u0027d try Information, and might guess that the unobtainable number differed from what she\u0027d given him by no more than a transposed couple of digits. So why wouldn\u0027t he pursue it?\n Maybe he never called her in the first place, never even learned that the number was phony. Maybe he\u0027d discarded her number in the airplane washroom on the way home to his wife and kids.\n Maybe he had a few guilt-ridden moments now and then, thinking of the art restorer waiting by her telephone for his call. Maybe he would find himself regretting his haste. No need, after all, to have thrown her number away. He might have been able to fit in a date with her from time to time. No reason she had to learn about the wife and kids. The hell, she\u0027d probably be grateful for someone to take her away from her paint tubes and turpentine.\n Halfway home I stopped at a deli and had soup and a sandwich and coffee. There was a bizarre story in the Post. Two neighbors in Queens had been arguing for months because of a dog that barked in its owner\u0027s absence. The previous night, the owner was walking the dog when the animal relieved itself on a tree in front of the neighbor\u0027s house. The neighbor happened to be watching and shot at the dog from an upstairs window with a bow and arrow. The dog\u0027s owner ran back into his house and came out with a Walther P-38, a World War II souvenir. The neighbor also ran outside with his bow and arrow, and the dog\u0027s owner shot him dead. The neighbor was eighty-one, the dog\u0027s owner was sixty-two, and the two men had lived side by side in Little Neck for over twenty years. The dog\u0027s age wasn\u0027t given, but there was a picture of him in the paper, straining against a leash in the hands of a uniformed police officer.\n Midtown North was a few blocks from my hotel. It was still raining in the same halfhearted fashion when I went over there a little after nine that night. I stopped at the front desk and a young fellow with a moustache and blow-dry hair pointed me to the staircase. I went up a flight and found the detective squad room. There were four plainclothes cops sitting at desks, a couple more down at the far end watching something on television. Three young black males in a holding pen paid some attention when I entered, then lost interest when they saw I wasn\u0027t their lawyer.\n I approached the nearest desk. A balding cop looked up from the report he was typing. I told him I had an appointment with Detective Durkin.\n A cop at another desk looked up and caught my eye. \"You must be Scudder,\" he said. \"I\u0027m Joe Durkin.\"\n His handshake was overly firm, almost a test of masculinity. He waved me into a chair and took his own seat, stubbed out a cigarette in an overflowing ashtray, lit a fresh one, leaned back and looked at me. His eyes were that pale shade of gray that doesn\u0027t show you a thing.\n He said, \"Still raining out there?\"\n \"Off and on.\"\n \"Miserable weather. You want some coffee?\"\n \"No thanks.\"\n \"What can I do for you?\"\n I told him I\u0027d like to see whatever he could show me on the Kim Dakkinen killing.\n \"Why?\"\n \"I told somebody I\u0027d look into it.\"\n \"You told somebody you\u0027d look into it? You mean you got a client?\"\n \"You could say that.\"\n \"Who?\"\n \"I can\u0027t tell you that.\"\n A muscle worked along the side of his jaw. He was around thirty-five and a few pounds overweight, enough to make him look a little older than his years. He hadn\u0027t lost any hair yet and it was all dark brown, almost black. He wore it combed flat down on his head. He should have borrowed a blow dryer from the guy downstairs.\n He said, \"You can\u0027t hold that out. You don\u0027t have a license and it wouldn\u0027t be privileged information even if you did.\"\n \"I didn\u0027t know we were in court.\"\n \"We\u0027re not. But you come in here asking a favor-\"\n I shrugged. \"I can\u0027t tell you my client\u0027s name. He has an interest in seeing her killer caught. That\u0027s all.\"\n \"And he thinks that\u0027ll happen faster if he hires you.\"\n \"Evidently.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/eight-million-ways-to-die-matthew-scudder-5/page-16.html","bookId":2323,"book":{"id":2323,"title":"Eight Million Ways to Die (Matthew Scudder #5)","description":"Storyline: \n Eight Million Ways to Die (Matthew Scudder #5) \n Nobody knows better than Matthew Scudder how far down a person can sink in this city.
