Mr.-\" \"Scudder.\" \"Mr. Scudder. That\u0027s over eighteen thousand cards a month.\" \"Only if all your guests leave after one night.\" \"The average stay is three nights. Even so, that\u0027s over six thousand registration cards a month, twelve thousand cards in two months. Do you realize how long it would take to look at twelve thousand cards?\" \"A person could probably do a couple thousand an hour,\" I said, \"since all he\u0027d be doing is scanning the signature to see if it\u0027s in script or in block caps. We\u0027re just talking about a couple of hours. I could do it or you could have some of your people do it.\" He shook his head. \"I couldn\u0027t authorize that,\" he said. \"I really couldn\u0027t. You\u0027re a private citizen, not a policeman, and while I did want to cooperate there\u0027s a limit to my authority here. If the police should make an official request-\" \"I realize I\u0027m asking a favor.\" \"If it were the sort of favor I could grant-\" \"It\u0027s an imposition,\" I went on, \"and I\u0027d certainly expect to pay for the time involved, the time and inconvenience.\" It would have worked at a smaller hotel, but here I was wasting my time. I don\u0027t think he even realized I was offering him a bribe. He said again that he\u0027d be glad to go along if the police made the request for me, and this time I let it lie. I asked instead if I could borrow the Jones registration card long enough to have a photocopy made. \"Oh, we have a machine right here,\" he said, grateful to be able to help. \"Just wait one moment.\" He came back with a copy. I thanked him and he asked if there was anything else, his tone suggesting he was confident there wouldn\u0027t be. I said I\u0027d like a look at the room she died in. \"But the police have quite finished there,\" he said. \"The room\u0027s in a transitional state now. The carpet had to be replaced, you see, and the walls painted.\" \"I\u0027d still like to see it.\" \"There\u0027s really nothing to see. I think there are workmen in there today. The painters are gone, I believe, but I think the carpet installers-\" \"I won\u0027t get in their way.\" He gave me a key and let me go up myself. I found the room and congratulated myself on my ability as a detective. The door was locked. The carpet installers looked to be on their lunch break. The old carpet had been removed, and new carpet covered about a third of the floor, with more of it rolled up awaiting installation. I spent a few minutes there. As the man had assured me, there was really nothing to see. The room was as empty of traces of Kim as it was of furniture. The walls were bright with fresh paint and the bathroom fairly sparkled. I walked around like some psychic practitioner, trying to pick up vibrations through the tips of my fingers. If there were any vibrations present, they eluded me. The window faced downtown, the view chopped up by the facades of other tall buildings. Through a gap between two of them I could catch a glimpse of the World Trade Center all the way downtown. Had she had time to look out the window? Had Mr. Jones looked out the window, before or afterward? I took the subway downtown. The train was one of the new ones, its interior a pleasing pattern of yellow and orange and tan. The inscribers of graffiti had already scarred it badly, scrawling their indecipherable messages over every available space. I didn\u0027t notice anyone smoking. I got off at West Fourth and walked south and west to Morton Street, where Fran Schecter had a small apartment on the top floor of a four-story brownstone. I rang her bell, announced myself over the intercom, and was buzzed through the vestibule door. The stairwell was full of smells- baking smells on the first floor, cat odor halfway up, and the unmistakable scent of marijuana at the top. I thought that you could draw a building\u0027s profile from the aromas in its stairwell. Fran was waiting for me in her doorway. Short curly hair, light brown in color, framed a round baby face. She had a button nose, a pouty mouth, and cheeks a chipmunk would have been proud of. She said, \"Hi, I\u0027m Fran. And you\u0027re Matt. Can I call you Matt?\" I assured her that she could, and her hand settled on my arm as she steered me inside. The marijuana reek was much stronger inside. The apartment was a studio. One fairly large room with a pullman kitchen on one wall. The furniture consisted of a canvas sling chair, a pillow sofa, some plastic milk crates assembled as shelves for books and clothes, and a large waterbed covered with a fake-fur spread. A framed poster on one wall over the waterbed showed a room interior, with a railway locomotive emerging from the fireplace. I turned down a drink, accepted a can of diet soda. I sat with it on the pillow sofa, which turned out to be more comfortable than it looked. She took the sling chair, which must have been more comfortable than it looked. \"Chance said you\u0027re investigating what happened to Kim,\" she said. \"He said to tell you whatever you want to know.\" There was a breathless little-girl quality to her voice and I couldn\u0027t tell how much of it was deliberate. I asked her what she knew about Kim. \"Not much. I met her a few times. Sometimes Chance\u0027ll take two girls at once out to dinner or a show. I guess I met everyone at one time or another. I just met Donna once, she\u0027s on her own trip, it\u0027s like she\u0027s lost in space. Have you met Donna?\" I shook my head. \"I like Sunny. I don\u0027t know if we\u0027re friends exactly, but she\u0027s the only one I\u0027d call up to talk to. I\u0027ll call her once, twice a week, or she\u0027ll call me, you know, and we\u0027ll talk.\" \"But you never called Kim?\" \"Oh, no. I never had her number, even.\" She thought for a moment. \"She had beautiful eyes. I can close my eyes and picture the color of them.\" Her own eyes were large, somewhere between brown and green. Her eyelashes were unusually long, and it struck me that they were probably false. She was a short girl of the body type they call a pony in Las Vegas chorus lines. She was wearing faded Levi\u0027s with the cuffs turned up and a hot pink sweater that was stretched tight over her full breasts. She hadn\u0027t known that Kim had planned to leave Chance, and she found the information interesting. \"Well, I can understand that,\" she said after some thought. \"He didn\u0027t really care for her, you know, and you don\u0027t want to stay forever with a man who doesn\u0027t care for you.\" \"What makes you say he didn\u0027t care for her?\" \"You pick these things up. I suppose he was glad to have her around, like she didn\u0027t make trouble and she brought in the bread, but he didn\u0027t have a feeling for her.\" \"Does he have a feeling for the others?\" \"He has a feeling for me,\" she said. \"And anybody else?\" \"He likes Sunny. Everybody likes Sunny, she\u0027s fun to be with. I don\u0027t know if he cares for her. Or Donna, I\u0027m sure he doesn\u0027t care for Donna, but I don\u0027t think she cares for him either. I think that\u0027s strictly business on both sides. Donna, I don\u0027t think Donna cares for anybody. I don\u0027t think she knows there are people in the world.\" \"How about Ruby?\" \"Have you met her?\" I hadn\u0027t. \"Well, she\u0027s like, you know, exotic. So he\u0027d like that. And Mary Lou\u0027s very intelligent and they go to concerts and shit, like Lincoln Center, classical music, but that doesn\u0027t mean he has a feeling for her.\" She started to giggle. I asked her what was so funny. \"Oh, I just flashed that I\u0027m the typical dumb hooker, thinks she\u0027s the only one the pimp loves. But you know what it is? I\u0027m the only one he can relax with. He can come up here and take his shoes off and let his mind roll out. Do you know what a karmic tie is?\" \"No.\" \"Well, it has something to do with reincarnation. I don\u0027t know if you believe in that.\" \"I never thought about it much.\" \"Well, I don\u0027t know if I believe in it either, but sometimes I think Chance and I knew each other in another life. Not necessarily as lovers or man and wife or anything like that. Like we could have been brother and sister, or maybe he was my father or I was his mother. Or we could even have both been the same sex because that can change from one lifetime to another. I mean we could have been sisters or something. Anything, really.\" The telephone cut into her speculations. She crossed the room to answer it, standing with her back to me, one hand propped against her hip. I couldn\u0027t hear her conversation. She talked for a moment or two, then covered the mouthpiece and turned to me. \"Matt,\" she said, \"I don\u0027t want to hassle you, but do you have any idea how long we\u0027re gonna be?\" \"Not long.\" \"Like could I tell somebody it would be cool to come over in an hour?\" \"No problem.\" She turned again, finished the conversation quietly, hung up. \"That was one of my regulars,\" she said. \"He\u0027s a real nice guy. I told him an hour.\" She sat down again. I asked her if she\u0027d had the apartment before she hooked up with Chance. She said she\u0027d been with Chance for two years and eight months and no, before that she shared a bigger place in Chelsea with three other girls. Chance had had this apartment all ready for her. All she\u0027d had to do was move into it. \"I just moved my furniture in,\" she said. \"Except the waterbed. That was already here. I had a single bed that I got rid of. And I bought the Magritte poster, and the masks were here.\" I hadn\u0027t noticed the masks and had to turn in my seat to see them, a grouping of three solemn ebony carvings on the wall behind me. \"He knows about them,\" she said. \"What tribe made them and everything. He knows things like that.\" I said that the apartment was an unlikely one for the use being made of it. She frowned, puzzled. \"Most girls in the game live in doorman buildings,\" I said. \"With elevators and all.\" \"Oh, right. I didn\u0027t know what you meant. Yes, that\u0027s true.\" She grinned brightly. \"This is something different,\" she said. \"The johns who come here, they don\u0027t think they\u0027re johns.\" \"How do you mean?\" \"They think they\u0027re friends of mine,\" she explained. \"They think I\u0027m this spacey Village chick, which I am, and that they\u0027re my friends, which they are. I mean, they come here to get laid, let\u0027s face it, but they could get laid quicker and easier in a massage parlor, no muss no fuss no bother, dig? But they can come up here and take off their shoes and smoke a joint, and it\u0027s a sort of a raunchy Village pad, I mean you have to climb three flights of stairs and then you roll around in a waterbed. I mean, I\u0027m not a hooker. I\u0027m a girlfriend. I don\u0027t get paid. They give me money because I got rent to pay and, you know, I\u0027m a poor little Village chick who wants to make it as an actress and she\u0027s never going to. Which I\u0027m not, and I don\u0027t care much, but I still take dancing lessons a couple mornings a week and I have an acting class with Ed Kovens every Thursday night, and I was in a showcase last May for three weekends in Tribeca. We did Ibsen, When We Dead Awake, and do you believe that three of my johns came?\" She chatted about the play, then began telling me how her clients brought her presents in addition to the money they gave her. \"I never have to buy any booze. In fact I have it to give away because I don\u0027t drink myself. And I haven\u0027t bought any grass in ages. You know who gets the best grass? Wall Street guys. They\u0027ll buy an ounce and we\u0027ll smoke a little and they\u0027ll leave me the ounce.\" She batted her long lashes at me. \"I kind of like to smoke,\" she said.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/eight-million-ways-to-die-matthew-scudder-5/page-20.html","bookId":2323,"book":{"id":2323,"title":"Eight Million Ways to Die (Matthew Scudder #5)","description":"Storyline: Eight Million Ways to Die (Matthew Scudder #5) Nobody knows better than Matthew Scudder how far down a person can sink in this city.
