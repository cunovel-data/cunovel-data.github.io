Maybe not.\"\\n\\n \"My girls\u0027ll know it\u0027s cool to talk to you.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027ll help.\"\\n\\n \"Not that they necessarily know anything, but if they do.\"\\n\\n \"Sometimes people know things without knowing they know them.\"\\n\\n \"And sometimes they tell without knowing they told.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s true, too.\"\\n\\n He stood up, put his hands on his hips. \"You know,\" he said, \"I didn\u0027t figure to bring you here. I didn\u0027t figure you needed to know about this house. And I brought you without you even asking.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s quite a house.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you.\"\\n\\n \"Was Kim impressed with it?\"\\n\\n \"She never saw it. None of \u0027em ever did. There\u0027s an old German woman comes here once a week to clean. Makes the whole place shine. She\u0027s the only woman\u0027s ever been inside of this house. Since I owned it, anyway, and the architects who used to live here didn\u0027t have much use for women. Here\u0027s the last of the coffee.\"\\n\\n It was awfully good coffee. I\u0027d had too much of it already but it was too good to pass up. When I complimented it earlier he\u0027d told me it was a mixture of Jamaica Blue Mountain and a dark roast Colombian bean. He\u0027d offered me a pound of it, and I\u0027d told him it wouldn\u0027t be much use to me in a hotel room.\\n\\n I sipped the coffee while he made yet another call to his service. When he hung up I said, \"You want to give me the number here? Or is that one secret you want to keep?\"\\n\\n He laughed. \"I\u0027m not here that much. It\u0027s easier if you just call the service.\"\\n\\n \"All right.\"\\n\\n \"And this number wouldn\u0027t do you much. I don\u0027t know it myself. I\u0027d have to look at an old phone bill to make sure I got it right. And if you dialed it, nothing would happen.\"\\n\\n \"Why\u0027s that?\"\\n\\n \"Because the bells won\u0027t ring. The phones are to make calls out. When I set this place up I got telephone service and I put in extensions so I\u0027d never be far from a phone, but I never gave the number to anybody. Not even my service, not anybody.\"\\n\\n \"And?\"\\n\\n \"And I was here one night, I think I was playing pool, and the damn phone rang. I like to jumped. It was somebody wanted to know did I want a subscription to the New York Times. Then two days later I got another call and it was a wrong number, and I realized the only calls I was ever going to get were wrong numbers and somebody selling something, and I took a screwdriver and went around and opened up each of the phones, and there\u0027s this little clapper that rings the bell when a current passes through a particular wire, and I just took the little clapper off each of the phones. I dialed the number once from another phone, and you think it rings because there\u0027s no telling the clapper\u0027s gone, but there\u0027s no bell going off in this house.\"\\n\\n \"Clever.\"\\n\\n \"No doorbell, either. There\u0027s a thing you ring by the door outside, but it\u0027s not connected to anything. That door\u0027s never been opened since I moved in, and you can\u0027t see in the windows, and there\u0027s burglar alarms on everything. Not that you get much burglary in Greenpoint, a nice settled Polish neighborhood like this, but old Dr. Levandowski, he likes his security and he likes his privacy.\"\\n\\n \"I guess he does.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not here much, Matthew, but when that garage door closes behind me it keeps the whole world out. Nothing touches me here. Nothing.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m surprised you brought me here.\"\\n\\n \"So am I.\"\\n\\n We saved the money for last. He asked how much I wanted. I told him I wanted twenty-five hundred dollars.\\n\\n He asked what that bought.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" I said. \"I don\u0027t charge by the hour and I don\u0027t keep track of my expenses. If I wind up laying out a lot of money or if the thing goes on too long, I might wind up asking you for more money. But I\u0027m not going to send you a bill and I\u0027m not going to sue you if you don\u0027t pay.\"\\n\\n \"You keep it all very informal.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right.\"\\n\\n \"I like that. Cash on the line and no receipts. I don\u0027t mind paying a price. The women bring in a lot of money, but there\u0027s a lot that has to go out, too. Rent. Operating costs. Payoffs. You got a whore installed in a building, you pay off the building. You can\u0027t give the doorman twenty dollars for Christmas and let it go at that, same as any other tenant. It\u0027s more like twenty a month and a hundred for Christmas, and it\u0027s the same for all the building employees. It adds up.\"\\n\\n \"It must.\"\\n\\n \"But there\u0027s a lot left. And I don\u0027t blow it on coke or waste it gambling. You said what? Twenty-five hundred? I paid more than twice that for the Dogon mask I gave you to hold. I paid $6,200, plus the auction galleries charge buyers a 10 percent commission these days. Comes to what? $6,820. And then there\u0027s sales tax.\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t say anything. He said, \"Shit, I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m proving. That I\u0027m nigger-rich, I guess. Wait here a minute.\" He came back with a sheaf of hundreds and counted out twenty-five of them. Used bills, out of sequence. I wondered how much cash he kept around the house, how much he habitually carried on his person. Years ago I\u0027d known a loan shark who made it a rule never to walk out his door with less than ten thousand dollars in his pocket. He didn\u0027t keep it a secret, and everybody who knew him knew about the roll he carried.\\n\\n Nobody ever tried to take it off him, either.\\n\\n He drove me home. We took a different route back, over the Pulaski Bridge into Queens and through the tunnel to Manhattan. Neither of us talked much, and somewhere along the way I must have dozed off because he had to put a hand on my shoulder to waken me.\\n\\n I blinked, straightened up in my seat. We were at the curb in front of my hotel.\\n\\n \"Door-to-door delivery service,\" he said.\\n\\n I got out and stood on the curb. He waited for a couple of cabs to pass, then made his U-turn. I watched until the Cadillac was out of sight.\\n\\n Thoughts struggled in my brain like exhausted swimmers. I was far too tired to think. I went up to bed.\\n\\n Chapter 12\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t know her all that well. I met her a year or so ago at the beauty parlor and we had a cup of coffee together, and reading between the lines of her conversation I figured out she wasn\u0027t the Avon lady. We exchanged numbers and we would talk now and then over the phone, but we never got close. Then whenever it was, a couple weeks ago, she called and wanted to get together. I was surprised. We\u0027d been out of touch for months.\"\\n\\n We were in Elaine Mardell\u0027s apartment on Fifty-first between First and Second. White shag carpet on the floor, bold abstract oils on the walls, something inoffensive on the stereo. I had a cup of coffee. Elaine was drinking a diet soda.\\n\\n \"What did she want?\"\\n\\n \"She told me she was leaving her pimp. She wanted to make the break without getting hurt. Which is where you came in, remember?\"\\n\\n I nodded. \"Why\u0027d she come to you?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. I had the feeling she didn\u0027t have too many friends. It wasn\u0027t the sort of thing she could talk over with one of Chance\u0027s other girls, and she probably wouldn\u0027t have wanted to discuss it with someone who was out of the life altogether. And she was young, you know, compared to me. She may have seen me as a sort of wise old aunt.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s you, all right.\"\\n\\n \"Isn\u0027t it just? What was she, about twenty-five?\"\\n\\n \"She said twenty-three. I think it said twenty-four in the papers.\"\\n\\n \"Jesus, that\u0027s young.\"\\n\\n \"I know.\"\\n\\n \"More coffee, Matt?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m fine.\"\\n\\n \"You know why I think she picked me to have that little conversation with? I think it\u0027s because I don\u0027t have a pimp.\" She settled herself in her seat, uncrossed and recrossed her legs. I remembered other times in this apartment, one of us on the couch, the other on the Eames chair, the same sort of unobtrusive music softening the room\u0027s hard edges.\\n\\n I said, \"You never had one, did you?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Do most girls?\"\\n\\n \"The ones she knew did. I think you pretty much have to on the street. Somebody\u0027s got to defend your right to a particular corner and bail you out when you get arrested. When you work out of an apartment like this, well, that\u0027s different. But even so, most of the hookers I know have boyfriends.\"\\n\\n \"Is that the same thing as a pimp?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, no. A boyfriend isn\u0027t running a batch of girls. He just happens to be your boyfriend. And you don\u0027t turn your money over to him. But you buy him a lot of things, just because you want to, and you help out with cash when he hits a rough spot in life, or if there\u0027s some business opportunity he wants to take advantage of, or because he needs a little loan and, gee, it\u0027s not like you were giving him the money. That\u0027s what a boyfriend is.\"\\n\\n \"Sort of a one-woman pimp.\"\\n\\n \"Sort of, except every girl swears her boyfriend\u0027s different, her relationship\u0027s different, and what never changes is who earns the money and who spends it.\"\\n\\n \"And you never had a pimp, did you? Or a boyfriend?\"\\n\\n \"Never. I had my palm read once and the woman who did it was impressed. \u0027You have a double head line, dear,\u0027 she told me. \u0027Your head rules your heart.\u0027 \" She came over, showed me her hand. \"It\u0027s this line right here. See?\"\\n\\n \"Looks good to me.\"\\n\\n \"Damn straight.\" She went back for her glass of soda, then came and sat on the couch beside me. She said, \"When I learned what happened to Kim, the first thing I did was call you. But you weren\u0027t in.\"\\n\\n \"I never got the message.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t leave one. I hung up and called a travel agent I know. A couple hours later I was on a plane for Barbados.\"\\n\\n \"Were you afraid you were on somebody\u0027s list?\"\\n\\n \"Hardly that. I just figured Chance killed her. I didn\u0027t think he\u0027d start knocking off all her friends and relations. No, I just knew it was time for a break. A week at a beachfront hotel. A little sun in the afternoon, a little roulette at night, and enough steel-drum music and limbo dancing to hold me for a long time.\"\\n\\n \"Sounds good.\"\\n\\n \"Second night out I met a fellow at the poolside cocktail party. He was staying at the next hotel over. Very nice fellow, tax lawyer, got divorced a year and a half ago and then went through a tough little affair with someone too young for him, and he\u0027s over that now, and who does he meet but me.\"\\n\\n \"And?\"\\n\\n \"And we had a nice little romance for the rest of the week. Long walks on the beach. Snorkeling, tennis. Romantic dinners. Drinks on my terrace. I had a terrace looking out at the sea.\"\\n\\n \"Here you\u0027ve got one looking at the East River.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not the same. We had a great time, Matt. Good sex, too. I thought I\u0027d have my work cut out for me, you know, acting shy. But I didn\u0027t have to act. I was shy, and then I got over my shyness.\"\\n\\n \"You didn\u0027t tell him-\"\\n\\n \"Are you kidding? Of course not. I told him I work for art galleries. I restore paintings. I\u0027m a freelance art restoration expert. He thought that was really fascinating and he had a lot of questions. It would have been easier if I\u0027d had the sense to pick something a little more humdrum, but, see, I wanted to be fascinating.\"\\n\\n \"Sure.\"\\n\\n She had her hands in her lap and she was looking at them. Her face was unlined but her years were beginning to show themselves on the back of her hands. I wondered how old she was. Thirty-six? Thirty-eight? \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/eight-million-ways-to-die-matthew-scudder-5/page-15.html","bookId":2323,"book":{"id":2323,"title":"Eight Million Ways to Die (Matthew Scudder #5)","description":"Storyline: Eight Million Ways to Die (Matthew Scudder #5) \\n Nobody knows better than Matthew Scudder how far down a person can sink in this city.
