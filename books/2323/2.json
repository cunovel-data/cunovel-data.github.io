{"id":62946,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"\"I don\u0027t know. Maybe you can do it yourself. Haven\u0027t you said anything to him? Hinted at it, talked about it, something like that?\" \"I\u0027m afraid.\" \"Of what?\" \"That he\u0027d kill me or mark me or something. Or that he\u0027d talk me out of it.\" She leaned forward, put her port-tipped fingers on my wrist. The gesture was clearly calculated but nonetheless effective for it. I breathed in her spicy scent and felt her sexual impact. I wasn\u0027t aroused and didn\u0027t want her but I could not be unaware of her sexual strength. She said, \"Can\u0027t you help me, Matt?\" And, immediately, \"Do you mind if I call you Matt?\" I had to laugh. \"No,\" I said. \"I don\u0027t mind.\" \"I make money but I don\u0027t get to keep it. And I don\u0027t really make more money than I did on the street. But I have a little money.\" \"Oh?\" \"I have a thousand dollars.\" I didn\u0027t say anything. She opened her purse, found a plain white envelope, got a finger under the flap and tore it open. She took a sheaf of bills from it and placed them on the table between us. \"You could see him for me,\" she said. I picked up the money, held it in my hand. I was being offered the opportunity to serve as intermediary between a blonde whore and a black pimp. It was not a role I\u0027d ever hungered for. I wanted to hand the money back. But I was nine or ten days out of Roosevelt Hospital and I owed money there, and on the first of the month my rent would be due, and I hadn\u0027t sent anything to Anita and the boys in longer than I cared to remember. I had money in my wallet and more money in the bank but it didn\u0027t add up to much, and Kim Dakkinen\u0027s money was as good as anybody else\u0027s and easier to come by, and what difference did it make what she\u0027d done to earn it? I counted the bills. They were used hundreds and there were ten of them. I left five on the table in front of me and handed the other five to her. Her eyes widened a little and I decided she had to be wearing contacts. Nobody had eyes that color. I said, \"Five now and five later. If I get you off the hook.\" \"Deal,\" she said, and grinned suddenly. \"You could have had the whole thousand in front.\" \"Maybe I\u0027ll work better with an incentive. You want some more coffee?\" \"If you\u0027re having some. And I think I\u0027d like something sweet. Do they have desserts here?\" \"The pecan pie\u0027s good. So\u0027s the cheesecake.\" \"I love pecan pie,\" she said. \"I have a terrible sweet tooth but I never gain an ounce. Isn\u0027t that lucky?\" Chapter 2 There was a problem. In order for me to talk to Chance I had to find him, and she couldn\u0027t tell me how to do it. \"I don\u0027t know where he lives,\" she said. \"Nobody does.\" \"Nobody?\" \"None of his girls. That\u0027s the big guessing game if a couple of us should happen to be together and he\u0027s not in the room. Trying to guess where Chance lives. One night I remember this girl Sunny and I were together and we were just goofing, coming up with one outrageous idea after another. Like he lives in this tenement in Harlem with his crippled mother, or he has this mansion in Sugar Hill, or he has a ranch house in the suburbs and commutes. Or he keeps a couple of suitcases in his car and lives out of them, just sleeping a couple hours a night at one of our apartments.\" She thought a moment. \"Except he never sleeps when he\u0027s with me. If we do go to bed he\u0027ll just lie there afterward for a little while and then he\u0027s up and dressed and out. He said once he can\u0027t sleep if there\u0027s another person in the room.\" \"Suppose you have to get in touch with him?\" \"There\u0027s a number to call. But it\u0027s an answering service. You can call the number any time, twenty-four hours a day, and there\u0027s always an operator that answers. He always checks in with his service. If we\u0027re out or something, he\u0027ll check in with them every thirty minutes, every hour.\" She gave me the number and I wrote it in my notebook. I asked her where he garaged his car. She didn\u0027t know. Did she remember the car\u0027s license number? She shook her head. \"I never notice things like that. His car is a Cadillac.\" \"There\u0027s a surprise. Where does he hang out?\" \"I don\u0027t know. If I want to reach him I leave a message. I don\u0027t go out looking for him. You mean is there a regular bar he drinks in? There\u0027s a lot of places he\u0027ll go sometimes, but nothing regular.\" \"What kind of things does he do?\" \"What do you mean?\" \"Does he go to ball games? Does he gamble? What does he do with himself?\" She considered the question. \"He does different things,\" she said. \"What do you mean?\" \"Depending who he\u0027s with. I like to go to jazz clubs so if he\u0027s with me that\u0027s where we\u0027ll go. I\u0027m the one he calls if he\u0027s looking for that kind of an evening. There\u0027s another girl, I don\u0027t even know her, but they go to concerts. You know, classical music. Carnegie Hall and stuff. Another girl, Sunny, digs sports, and he\u0027ll take her to ball games.\" \"How many girls has he got?\" \"I don\u0027t know. There\u0027s Sunny and Nan and the girl who likes classical music. Maybe there\u0027s one or two others. Maybe more. Chance is very private, you know? He keeps things to himself.\" \"The only name you\u0027ve got for him is Chance?\" \"That\u0027s right.\" \"You\u0027ve been with him, what, three years? And you\u0027ve got half a name and no address and the number of his answering service.\" She looked down at her hands. \"How does he pick up the money?\" \"From me, you mean? Sometimes he\u0027ll come by for it.\" \"Does he call first?\" \"Not necessarily. Sometimes. Or he\u0027ll call and tell me to bring it to him. At a coffee shop or a bar or something, or to be on a certain corner and he\u0027ll pick me up.\" \"You give him everything you make?\" A nod. \"He found me my apartment, he pays the rent, the phone, all the bills. We\u0027ll shop for my clothes and he\u0027ll pay. He likes picking out my clothes. I give him what I make and he gives me back some, you know, for walking-around money.\" \"You don\u0027t hold anything out?\" \"Sure I do. How do you think I got the thousand dollars? But it\u0027s funny, I don\u0027t hold out much.\" The place was filling up with office workers by the time she left. By then she\u0027d had enough coffee and switched to white wine. She had one glass of the wine and left half of it. I stayed with black coffee. I had her address and phone in my notebook along with Chance\u0027s answering service, but I didn\u0027t have a whole lot more than that. On the other hand, how much did I need? Sooner or later I would get hold of him, and when I did I would talk to him, and if it broke right I\u0027d throw a bigger scare into him than he\u0027d managed to throw into Kim. And if not, well, I still had five hundred dollars more than I had when I woke up that morning. After she left I finished my coffee and cracked one of her hundreds to pay my tab. Armstrong\u0027s is on Ninth Avenue between Fifty-seventh and Fifty-eighth, and my hotel is around the corner on Fifty-seventh Street. I went to it, checked the desk for mail and messages, then called Chance\u0027s service from the pay phone in the lobby. A woman answered on the third ring, repeating the four final digits of the number and asking if she could help me. \"I want to speak to Mr. Chance,\" I said. \"I expect to speak with him soon,\" she said. She sounded middle-aged, with a chain smoker\u0027s rasp to her voice. \"May I take a message for him?\" I gave her my name and my phone number at the hotel. She asked what my call was in reference to. I told her it was personal. When I hung up the phone I felt shaky, maybe from all the coffee I\u0027d been sipping all day. I wanted a drink. I thought about going across the street to Polly\u0027s Cage for a quick one, or hitting the liquor store two doors down from Polly\u0027s and picking up a pint of bourbon. I could envision the booze, Jim Beam or J. W. Dant, some no-nonsense brown whiskey in a flat pint bottle. I thought, C\u0027mon, it\u0027s raining out there, you don\u0027t want to go out in the rain. I left the phone booth and turned toward the elevator instead of the front door and went up to my room. I locked myself in and pulled the chair over to the window and watched the rain. The urge to drink went away after a few minutes. Then it came back and then it went away again. It came and went for the next hour, winking on and off like a neon sign. I stayed where I was and watched the rain. Around seven I picked up the phone in my room and called Elaine Mardell. Her machine answered, and when the beep sounded I said, \"This is Matt. I saw your friend and I wanted to thank you for the referral. Maybe one of these days I can return the favor.\" I hung up and waited another half hour. Chance didn\u0027t return my call. I wasn\u0027t especially hungry but I made myself go downstairs for something to eat. It had quit raining. I went over to the Blue Jay and ordered a hamburger and fries. A guy two tables over was having a beer with his sandwich and I decided to order one when the waiter brought my burger, but by the time that happened I\u0027d changed my mind. I ate most of the hamburger and about half of the fries and drank two cups of coffee, then ordered cherry pie for dessert and ate most of it. It was almost eight-thirty when I left there. I stopped at my hotel- no messages- and then walked the rest of the way to Ninth Avenue. There used to be a Greek bar on the corner, Antares and Spiro\u0027s, but it\u0027s a fruit and vegetable market now. I turned uptown and walked past Armstrong\u0027s and across Fifty-eighth Street, and when the light changed I crossed the avenue and walked on up past the hospital to St. Paul \u0027s. I walked around the side and down a narrow flight of stairs to the basement. A cardboard sign hung from the doorknob, but you\u0027d have to be looking for it to see it. A.A., it said. They were just getting started when I walked in. There were three tables set up in a U, with people seated on either sides of the tables and perhaps a dozen other chairs arranged at the back. Another table off to the side held refreshments. I got a Styrofoam cup and drew coffee from the urn, then took a chair at the rear. A couple of people nodded to me and I nodded back. The speaker was a fellow about my age. He was wearing a herringbone tweed jacket over a plaid flannel shirt. He told the story of his life from his first drink in his early teens until he came into the program and got sober four years ago. He was married and divorced a few times, cracked up several cars, lost jobs, hit a few hospitals. Then he stopped drinking and started going to meetings and things got better. \"Things didn\u0027t get better,\" he said, correcting himself. \"I got better.\" They say that a lot. They say a lot of things a lot and you get to hear the same phrases over and over. The stories are pretty interesting, though. People sit up there in front of God and everybody and tell you the goddamnedest things. He spoke for half an hour. Then they took a ten-minute break and passed the basket for expenses. I put in a dollar, then helped myself to another cup of coffee and a couple of oatmeal cookies. A fellow in an old army jacket greeted me by name. I remembered his name was Jim and returned the greeting. He asked me how things were going and I told him they were going all right. \"You\u0027re here and you\u0027re sober,\" he said. \"That\u0027s the important thing.\" \"I suppose.\" \"Any day I don\u0027t take a drink is a good day. You\u0027re staying sober a day at a time. The hardest thing in the world is for an alcoholic to not drink and you\u0027re doing it.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/eight-million-ways-to-die-matthew-scudder-5/page-2.html","bookId":2323,"book":{"id":2323,"title":"Eight Million Ways to Die (Matthew Scudder #5)","description":"Storyline: Eight Million Ways to Die (Matthew Scudder #5) Nobody knows better than Matthew Scudder how far down a person can sink in this city.
