{"id":62947,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"Except I wasn\u0027t. I\u0027d been out of the hospital for nine or ten days. I would stay sober for two or three days and then I would pick up a drink. Mostly it was a drink or two drinks or three drinks and it stayed under control, but Sunday night I\u0027d been bad drunk, drinking bourbon at a Blarney Stone on Sixth Avenue where I didn\u0027t figure to run into anybody I knew. I couldn\u0027t remember leaving the bar and didn\u0027t know how I got home, and Monday morning I had the shakes and a dry mouth and felt like walking death.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t tell him any of this.\\n\\n After ten minutes they started the meeting again and went around the room. People would say their names and say they were alcoholics and thank the speaker for his qualification, which is what they call the life story that he told. Then they would go on to talk about how they\u0027d identified with the speaker, or recall some memory from their drinking days, or speak about some difficulty they were dealing with in the course of trying to lead a sober life. A girl not much older than Kim Dakkinen talked about problems with her lover, and a gay man in his thirties described a hassle he\u0027d had that day with a customer at his travel agency. It made a funny story and got a lot of laughs.\\n\\n One woman said, \"Staying sober is the easiest thing in the world. All you have to do is don\u0027t drink, go to meetings, and be willing to change your whole fucking life.\"\\n\\n When it got to me I said, \"My name is Matt. I\u0027ll pass.\"\\n\\n The meeting ended at ten. I stopped at Armstrong\u0027s on my way home and took a seat at the bar. They tell you to stay out of bars if you\u0027re trying not to drink but I\u0027m comfortable there and the coffee\u0027s good. If I\u0027m going to drink I\u0027ll drink and it doesn\u0027t matter where I am.\\n\\n By the time I left there the early edition of the News was on the street. I picked it up and went back to my room. There was still no message from Kim Dakkinen\u0027s pimp. I called his service again, which established that he had received my message. I left another message and said that it was important I hear from him as soon as possible.\\n\\n I showered and put on a robe and read the paper. I read the national and international stories but I can never really focus on them. Things have to be on a smaller scale and happen closer to home before I can relate to them.\\n\\n There was plenty to relate to. Two kids in the Bronx threw a young woman in front of the D train. She\u0027d lain flat and, although six cars passed over her before the motorman got the train stopped, she\u0027d escaped without injury.\\n\\n Down on West Street, near the Hudson docks, a prostitute had been murdered. Stabbed, the story said.\\n\\n A housing authority cop in Corona was still in critical condition. Two days ago I\u0027d read how he\u0027d been attacked by two men who hit him with lengths of pipe and stole his gun. He had a wife and four children under ten.\\n\\n The telephone didn\u0027t ring. I didn\u0027t really expect it to. I couldn\u0027t think of any reason for Chance to return my call outside of curiosity, and perhaps he remembered what that had done to the cat. I could have identified myself as a cop- Mr. Scudder was easier to ignore than Police Officer Scudder, or Detective Scudder- but I didn\u0027t like to run that kind of game if I didn\u0027t have to. I was willing to let people jump to conclusions but reluctant to give them a push.\\n\\n So I\u0027d have to find him. That was just as well. It would give me something to do. In the meantime the messages I left with his service would fix my name in his head.\\n\\n The elusive Mr. Chance. You\u0027d think he\u0027d have a mobile phone unit in his pimpmobile, along with the bar and the fur upholstery and the pink velvet sun visor. All those touches of class.\\n\\n I read the sports pages and then went back to the hooker stabbing in the Village. The story was very sketchy. They didn\u0027t have a name or any description beyond identifying the victim as being about twenty-five years old.\\n\\n I called the News to see if they had a name for the victim and was told they weren\u0027t giving out that information. Pending notification of kin, I suppose. I called the Sixth Precinct but Eddie Koehler wasn\u0027t on duty and I couldn\u0027t think of anyone else at the Sixth who might know me. I got out my notebook and decided it was too late to call her, that half the women in the city were hookers and there was no reason to suppose she\u0027d been the one to get sliced up underneath the West Side Highway. I put the notebook away, and ten minutes later I dug it out again and dialed her number.\\n\\n I said, \"It\u0027s Matt Scudder, Kim. I just wondered if you happened to speak to your friend since I saw you.\"\\n\\n \"No, I haven\u0027t. Why?\"\\n\\n \"I thought I might reach him through his service. I don\u0027t think he\u0027s going to get back to me, so tomorrow I\u0027ll have to go out and look for him. You haven\u0027t said anything to him about wanting out?\"\\n\\n \"Not a word.\"\\n\\n \"Good. If you see him before I do, just act as though nothing\u0027s changed. And if he calls and wants you to meet him somewhere, call me right away.\"\\n\\n \"At the number you gave me?\"\\n\\n \"Right. If you reach me I\u0027ll be able to keep the appointment in your place. If not, just go ahead and play it straight.\"\\n\\n I talked a little while longer, calming her down some after having alarmed her with the call in the first place. At least I knew she hadn\u0027t died on West Street. At least I could sleep easy.\\n\\n Sure. I killed the light and got into bed and just lay there for a long time, and then I gave up and got up and read the paper again. The thought came to me that a couple of drinks would take the edge off and let me sleep. I couldn\u0027t banish the thought but I could make myself stay where I was, and when four o\u0027clock came I told myself to forget it because the bars were closed now. There was an after-hours on Eleventh Avenue but I conveniently forgot about it.\\n\\n I turned off the light and got in bed again and thought about the dead hooker and the housing cop and the woman who\u0027d been run over by the subway train, and I wondered why anyone would think it a good idea to stay sober in this city, and I held onto that thought and fell asleep with it.\\n\\n Chapter 3\\n\\n I got up around ten-thirty, surprisingly well rested after six hours of skimming the surface of sleep. I showered and shaved, had coffee and a roll for breakfast, and went over to St. Paul \u0027s. Not to the basement this time but to the church proper, where I sat in a pew for ten minutes or so before lighting a couple of candles and slipping fifty dollars into the poor box. At the post office on Sixtieth Street I bought a two-hundred-dollar money order and an envelope with the stamp embossed. I mailed the money order to my ex-wife in Syosset. I tried to write a note to enclose but it came out apologetic. The money was too little and too late but she would know that without my having to tell her. I wrapped the money order in a blank sheet of paper and mailed it that way.\\n\\n It was a gray day, on the cool side, with the threat of more rain. There was a raw wind blowing and it cut around corners like a scatback. In front of the Coliseum a man was chasing his hat and cursing, and I reached up reflexively and gave a tug to the brim of mine.\\n\\n I walked most of the way to my bank before deciding I didn\u0027t have enough of Kim\u0027s advance left to necessitate formal financial transactions. I went to my hotel instead and paid half of the coming month\u0027s rent on account. By then I had only one of the hundreds intact and I cracked that into tens and twenties while I was at it.\\n\\n Why hadn\u0027t I taken the full thousand in front? I remembered what I\u0027d said about an incentive. Well, I had one.\\n\\n My mail was routine- a couple of circulars, a letter from my congressman. Nothing I had to read.\\n\\n No message from Chance. Not that I\u0027d expected one.\\n\\n I called his service and left another message just for the hell of it.\\n\\n I got out of there and stayed out all afternoon. I took the subway a couple of times but mostly walked. It kept threatening to rain but it kept not raining, and the wind got even more of an edge to it but never did get my hat. I hit two police precinct houses and a few coffee shops and half a dozen gin mills. I drank coffee in the coffee shops and Coca-Cola in the bars, and I talked to a few people and made a couple of notes. I called my hotel desk a few times. I wasn\u0027t expecting a call from Chance but I wanted to be in touch in case Kim called. But no one had called me. I tried Kim\u0027s number twice and both times her machine answered. Everybody\u0027s got one of those machines and someday all the machines will start dialing and talk to each other. I didn\u0027t leave any messages.\\n\\n Toward the end of the afternoon I ducked into a Times Square theater. They had two Clint Eastwood movies paired, ones where he\u0027s a rogue cop who settles things by shooting the bad guys. The audience looked to be composed almost entirely of the sort of people he was shooting. They cheered wildly every time he blew somebody away.\\n\\n I had pork fried rice and vegetables at a Cuban Chinese place on Eighth Avenue, checked my hotel desk again, stopped at Armstrong\u0027s and had a cup of coffee. I got into a conversation at the bar and thought I\u0027d stay there awhile, but by eight-thirty I\u0027d managed to get out the door and across the street and down the stairs to the meeting.\\n\\n The speaker was a housewife who used to drink herself into a stupor while her husband was at his office and the kids were at school. She told how her kid would find her passed out on the kitchen floor and she convinced him it was a yoga exercise to help her back. Everybody laughed.\\n\\n When it was my turn I said, \"My name is Matt. I\u0027ll just listen tonight.\"\\n\\n Kelvin Small\u0027s is on Lenox Avenue at 127th Street. It\u0027s a long narrow room with a bar running the length of it and a row of banquette tables opposite the bar. There\u0027s a small bandstand all the way at the back, and on it two dark-skinned blacks with close-cropped hair and horn-rimmed sunglasses and Brooks Brothers suits played quiet jazz, one on a small upright piano, the other using brushes on cymbals. They looked and sounded like half of the old Modern Jazz Quartet.\\n\\n It was easy for me to hear them because the rest of the room went silent when I cleared the threshold. I was the only white man in the room and everybody stopped for a long look at me. There were a couple of white women, seated with black men at the banquette tables, and there were two black women sharing a table, and there must have been two dozen men in every shade but mine.\\n\\n I walked the length of the room and went into the men\u0027s room. A man almost tall enough for pro basketball was combing his straightened hair. The scent of his pomade vied with the sharp reek of marijuana. I washed my hands and rubbed them together under one of those hot-air dryers. The tall man was still working on his hair when I left.\\n\\n Conversation died again when I emerged from the men\u0027s room. I walked toward the front again, walked slowly and let my shoulders roll. I couldn\u0027t be sure about the musicians, but aside from them I figured there wasn\u0027t a man in the room who hadn\u0027t taken at least one felony bust. Pimps, drug dealers, gamblers, policy men. Nature\u0027s noblemen.\\n\\n A man on the fifth stool from the front caught my eye. It took a second to place him because when I knew him years ago he had straight hair, but now he was wearing it in a modified Afro. His suit was lime green and his shoes were the skin of some reptile, probably an endangered species.\\n\\n I moved my head toward the door and walked on past him and out. I walked two doors south on Lenox and stood next to a streetlamp. Two or three minutes went by and he came on out, walking loose-limbed and easy. \"Hey, Matthew,\" he said, and extended his hand for a slap. \"How\u0027s my man?\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t slap his hand. He looked down at it, up at me, rolled his eyes, gave his head an exaggerated shake, clapped his hands together, dusted them against his trouser legs, then placed them on his slim hips. \"Been some time,\" he said. \"They run out of your brand downtown? Or do you just come to Harlem to use the little boy\u0027s room?\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/eight-million-ways-to-die-matthew-scudder-5/page-3.html","bookId":2323,"book":{"id":2323,"title":"Eight Million Ways to Die (Matthew Scudder #5)","description":"Storyline: Eight Million Ways to Die (Matthew Scudder #5) \\n Nobody knows better than Matthew Scudder how far down a person can sink in this city.
