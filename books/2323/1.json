It would have been hard to miss. She had blonde hair that was close to white, the sort that\u0027s called towhead when it belongs to a child. Hers was plaited in heavy braids that she\u0027d wrapped around her head and secured with pins. She had a high smooth forehead and prominent cheekbones and a mouth that was just a little too wide. In her western-style boots she must have run to six feet, most of her length in her legs. She was wearing designer jeans the color of burgundy and a short fur jacket the color of champagne. It had been raining on and off all day, and she wasn\u0027t carrying an umbrella or wearing anything on her head. Beads of water glinted like diamonds on her plaited hair.\n She stood for a moment in the doorway getting her bearings. It was around three-thirty on a Wednesday afternoon, which is about as slow as it gets at Armstrong\u0027s. The lunch crowd was long gone and it was too early for the after-work people. In another fifteen minutes a couple of schoolteachers would stop in for a quick one, and then some nurses from Roosevelt Hospital whose shift ended at four, but for the moment there were three or four people at the bar and one couple finishing a carafe of wine at a front table and that was it. Except for me, of course, at my usual table in the rear.\n She made me right away, and I caught the blue of her eyes all the way across the room. But she stopped at the bar to make sure before making her way between the tables to where I was sitting.\n She said, \"Mr. Scudder? I\u0027m Kim Dakkinen. I\u0027m a friend of Elaine Mardell\u0027s.\"\n \"She called me. Have a seat.\"\n \"Thank you.\"\n She sat down opposite me, placed her handbag on the table between us, took out a pack of cigarettes and a disposable lighter, then paused with the cigarette unlit to ask if it was all right if she smoked. I assured her that it was.\n Her voice wasn\u0027t what I\u0027d expected. It was quite soft, and the only accent it held was Midwestern. After the boots and the fur and the severe facial planes and the exotic name, I\u0027d been anticipating something more out of a masochist\u0027s fantasy: harsh and stern and European. She was younger, too, than I\u0027d have guessed at first glance. No more than twenty-five.\n She lit her cigarette and positioned the lighter on top of the cigarette pack. The waitress, Evelyn, had been working days for the past two weeks because she\u0027d landed a small part in an off-Broadway showcase. She always looked on the verge of a yawn. She came to the table while Kim Dakkinen was playing with her lighter. Kim ordered a glass of white wine. Evelyn asked me if I wanted more coffee, and when I said yes Kim said, \"Oh, are you having coffee? I think I\u0027d like that instead of wine. Would that be all right?\"\n When the coffee arrived she added cream and sugar, stirred, sipped, and told me she wasn\u0027t much of a drinker, especially early in the day. But she couldn\u0027t drink it black the way I did, she\u0027d never been able to drink black coffee, she had to have it sweet and rich, almost like dessert, and she supposed she was just lucky but she\u0027d never had a weight problem, she could eat anything and never gain an ounce, and wasn\u0027t that lucky?\n I agreed that it was.\n Had I known Elaine long? For years, I said. Well, she hadn\u0027t really known her that long herself, in fact she hadn\u0027t even been in New York too terribly long, and she didn\u0027t know her that well either, but she thought Elaine was awfully nice. Didn\u0027t I agree? I agreed. Elaine was very levelheaded, too, very sensible, and that was something, wasn\u0027t it? I agreed it was something.\n I let her take her time. She had acres of small talk, she smiled and held your eyes with hers when she talked, and she could probably have walked off with the Miss Congeniality award in any beauty contest she didn\u0027t win outright, and if it took her awhile to get to the point that was fine with me. I had no place else to go and nothing better to do.\n She said, \"You used to be a policeman.\"\n \"A few years back.\"\n \"And now you\u0027re a private detective.\"\n \"Not exactly.\" The eyes widened. They were a very vivid blue, an unusual shade, and I wondered if she were wearing contact lenses. The soft lenses sometimes do curious things to eye color, altering some shades, intensifying others.\n \"I don\u0027t have a license,\" I explained. \"When I decided I didn\u0027t want to carry a badge anymore I didn\u0027t figure I wanted to carry a license, either.\" Or fill out forms or keep records or check in with the tax collector. \"Anything I do is very unofficial.\"\n \"But it\u0027s what you do? It\u0027s how you make your living?\"\n \"That\u0027s right.\"\n \"What do you call it? What you do.\"\n You could call it hustling a buck, except that I don\u0027t hustle a whole lot. The work finds me. I turn down more than I handle, and the jobs I accept are ones I can\u0027t think of a way to turn down. Right now I was wondering what this woman wanted from me, and what excuse I\u0027d find to say no.\n \"I don\u0027t know what to call it,\" I told her. \"You could say that I do favors for friends.\"\n Her face lit up. She\u0027d been doing a lot of smiling ever since she walked in the door but this was the first smile that got as far as her eyes. \"Well, hell, that\u0027s perfect,\" she said. \"I could use a favor. As far as that goes, I could use a friend.\"\n \"What\u0027s the problem?\"\n She bought some thinking time by lighting another cigarette, then lowered her eyes to watch her hands as she centered the lighter on top of the pack. Her nails were well manicured, long but not awkward, lacquered the color of tawny port. She wore a gold ring set with a large square-cut green stone on the third finger of her left hand. She said, \"You know what I do. Same as Elaine.\"\n \"So I gathered.\"\n \"I\u0027m a hooker.\"\n I nodded. She straightened in her seat, squared her shoulders, adjusted the fur jacket, opened the clasp at her throat. I caught a trace of her perfume. I\u0027d smelled that spicy scent before but couldn\u0027t recall the occasion. I picked up my cup, finished my coffee.\n \"I want out.\"\n \"Of the life?\"\n She nodded. \"I\u0027ve been doing this for four years. I came here four years ago in July. August, September, October, November. Four years and four months. I\u0027m twenty-three years old. That\u0027s young, isn\u0027t it?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"It doesn\u0027t feel so young.\" She adjusted the jacket again, refastened the clasp. Light glinted off her ring. \"When I got off the bus four years ago I had a suitcase in one hand and a denim jacket over my arm. Now I\u0027ve got this. It\u0027s ranch mink.\"\n \"It\u0027s very becoming.\"\n \"I\u0027d trade it for the old denim jacket,\" she said, \"if I could have the years back. No, I wouldn\u0027t. Because if I had them back I\u0027d just do the same thing with them, wouldn\u0027t I? Oh to be nineteen again and know what I know now, but the only way that could be is if I started tricking at fifteen, and then I\u0027d be dead by now. I\u0027m just rambling. I\u0027m sorry.\"\n \"No need.\"\n \"I want to get out of the life.\"\n \"And do what? Go back to Minnesota?\"\n \" Wisconsin. No, I won\u0027t be going back. There\u0027s nothing there for me. Just because I want out doesn\u0027t mean I have to go back.\"\n \"Okay.\"\n \"I can make lots of trouble for myself that way. I reduce things to two alternatives, so if A is no good that means I\u0027m stuck with B. But that\u0027s not right. There\u0027s the whole rest of the alphabet.\"\n She could always teach philosophy. I said, \"Where do I come in, Kim?\"\n \"Oh. Right.\"\n I waited.\n \"I have this pimp.\"\n \"And he won\u0027t let you leave?\"\n \"I haven\u0027t said anything to him. I think maybe he knows, but I haven\u0027t said anything and he hasn\u0027t said anything and-\" Her whole upper body trembled for a moment, and small beads of perspiration glistened on her upper lip.\n \"You\u0027re afraid of him.\"\n \"How\u0027d you guess?\"\n \"Has he threatened you?\"\n \"Not really.\"\n \"What does that mean?\"\n \"He never threatened me. But I feel threatened.\"\n \"Have other girls tried to leave?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t know much about his other girls. He\u0027s very different from other pimps. At least from the ones I know about.\"\n They\u0027re all different. Just ask their girls. \"How?\" I asked her.\n \"He\u0027s more refined. Subdued.\"\n Sure. \"What\u0027s his name?\"\n \"Chance.\"\n \"First name or last name?\"\n \"It\u0027s all anybody ever calls him. I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s a first name or a last name. Maybe it\u0027s neither, maybe it\u0027s a nickname. People in the life, they\u0027ll have different names for different occasions.\"\n \"Is Kim your real name?\"\n She nodded. \"But I had a street name. I had a pimp before Chance, his name was Duffy. Duffy Green, he called himself, but he was also Eugene Duffy and he had another name he used sometimes that I forget.\" She smiled at a memory. \"I was so green when he turned me out. He didn\u0027t pick me up right off the bus but he might as well.\"\n \"He a black man?\"\n \"Duffy? Sure. So is Chance. Duffy put me on the street. The Lexington Avenue stroll, and sometimes when it was hot there we\u0027d go across the river to Long Island City.\" She closed her eyes for a moment. When she opened them she said, \"I just got this rush of memory, what it was like on the street. My street name was Bambi. In Long Island City we did the johns in their cars. They would drive in from all over Long Island. On Lexington we had a hotel we could use. I can\u0027t believe I used to do that, I used to live like that. God, I was green! I wasn\u0027t innocent. I knew what I came to New York for, but I was green all right.\"\n \"How long were you on the street?\"\n \"It must have been five, six months. I wasn\u0027t very good. I had the looks and I could, you know, perform, but I didn\u0027t have street smarts. And a couple of times I had anxiety attacks and I couldn\u0027t function. Duffy gave me stuff but all it ever did was make me sick.\"\n \"Stuff?\"\n \"You know. Drugs.\"\n \"Right.\"\n \"Then he put me in this house, and that was better, but he didn\u0027t like it because he had less control that way. There was this big apartment near Columbus Circle and I went to work there like you would go to an office. I was in the house, I don\u0027t know, maybe another six months. Just about that. And then I went with Chance.\"\n \"How did that happen?\"\n \"I was with Duffy. We were at this bar. Not a pimp bar, a jazz club, and Chance came and sat at our table. We all three sat and talked, and then they left me at the table and went off and talked some more, and Duffy came back alone and said I was to go with Chance. I thought he meant I should do him, you know, like a trick, and I was pissed because this was supposed to be our evening together and why should I be working. See, I didn\u0027t take Chance for a pimp. Then he explained that I was going to be Chance\u0027s girl from now on. I felt like a car he just sold.\"\n \"Is that what he did? Did he sell you to Chance?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know what he did. But I went with Chance and it was all right. It was better than with Duffy. He took me out of that house and put me on a phone and it\u0027s been, oh, three years now.\"\n \"And you want me to get you off the hook.\"\n \"Can you do it?\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/eight-million-ways-to-die-matthew-scudder-5/page-1.html","bookId":2323,"book":{"id":2323,"title":"Eight Million Ways to Die (Matthew Scudder #5)","description":"Storyline: \n Eight Million Ways to Die (Matthew Scudder #5) \n Nobody knows better than Matthew Scudder how far down a person can sink in this city.
