{"id":62951,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"That was close enough for me to let it pass. A stray bullet of mine had killed a young girl named Estrellita Rivera, but I don\u0027t know that it was guilt over the incident that propelled me out of the police department. What it had done, really, was change the way the world looked to me, so that being a cop was no longer something I wanted to do. Neither was being a husband and a father and living on Long Island, and in due course I was out of work and out of the marriage and living on Fifty-seventh Street and putting in the hours at Armstrong\u0027s. The shooting unquestionably set those currents in motion, but I think I was pointed in those directions anyway and would have gotten there sooner or later. \"Now you\u0027re a sort of half-assed detective,\" he went on \"She hire you?\" \"More or less.\" \"What\u0027s that mean?\" He didn\u0027t wait for clarification. \"Nothing against you, but she wasted her money. Or my money, according to how you look at it. If she wants to end our arrangement all she has to do is tell me so. She doesn\u0027t need anyone to do her talking for her. What\u0027s she plan to do? I hope she\u0027s not going back home.\" I didn\u0027t say anything. \"I suspect she\u0027ll stay in New York. But will she stay in the life? I\u0027m afraid it\u0027s the only trade she knows. What else will she do? And where will she live? I provide their apartments, you know, and pay their rent and pick out their clothes. Well, I don\u0027t suppose anyone asked Ibsen where Nora would find an apartment. I believe this is where you live, if I\u0027m not mistaken.\" I looked out the window. We were in front of my hotel. I hadn\u0027t been paying attention. \"I assume you\u0027ll be in touch with Kim,\" he said. \"If you want, you can tell her you intimidated me and sent me slinking off into the night.\" \"Why would I do that?\" \"So she\u0027ll think she got her money\u0027s worth from you.\" \"She got her money\u0027s worth,\" I said, \"and I don\u0027t care whether she knows it or not. All I\u0027ll tell her is what you\u0027ve told me.\" \"Really? While you\u0027re at it, you can let her know that I\u0027ll be coming to see her. Just to satisfy myself that all of this is really her idea.\" \"I\u0027ll mention it.\" \"And tell her she has no reason to fear me.\" He sighed. \"They think they\u0027re irreplaceable. If she had any notion how easily she can be replaced she\u0027d most likely hang herself. The buses bring them, Scudder. Every hour of every day they stream into Port Authority ready to sell themselves. And every day a whole slew of others decide there must be a better way than waiting tables or punching a cash register. I could open an office, Scudder, and take applications, and there\u0027d be a line halfway around the block.\" I opened the door. He said, \"I enjoyed this. Especially earlier. You have a good eye for boxing. Please tell that silly blonde whore that nobody\u0027s going to kill her.\" \"I\u0027ll do that.\" \"And if you need to talk to me, just call my service. I\u0027ll return your calls now that I know you.\" I got out, closed the door. He waited for an opening, made a U-turn, turned again at Eighth Avenue and headed uptown. The U-turn was illegal and he ran the light making his left turn on Eighth, but I don\u0027t suppose it worried him much. I couldn\u0027t recall the last time I\u0027d seen a cop ticket anyone for a moving violation in the city of New York. Sometimes you\u0027ll see five cars go on through after a light turns red. Even the buses do it these days. After he made his turn I took out my notebook, made an entry. Across the street, near Polly\u0027s Cage, a man and woman were having a loud argument. \"You call yourself a man?\" she demanded. He slapped her. She cursed him and he slapped her again. Maybe he\u0027d beat her senseless. Maybe this was a game they played five nights out of seven. Try to break up that sort of thing and as likely as not they\u0027ll both turn on you. When I was a rookie cop, my first partner would do anything to avoid interfering in a domestic argument. Once, facing down a drunken husband, he\u0027d been assaulted from behind by the wife. The husband had knocked out four of her teeth but she leaped to his defense, breaking a bottle over her savior\u0027s head. He wound up with fifteen stitches and a concussion, and he used to run his forefinger over the scar when he told me the story. You couldn\u0027t see the scar, his hair covered it, but his finger went right to the spot. \"I say let \u0027em kill each other,\" he used to say. \"It don\u0027t matter if she phoned in the complaint herself, she\u0027ll still turn on you. Let \u0027em fucking kill each other.\" Across the street, the woman said something I didn\u0027t catch and the man hit her low with his closed fist. She cried out in what sounded like real pain. I put my notebook away and went into my hotel. I called Kim from the lobby. Her machine answered and I had started to leave a message when she picked up the receiver and interrupted me. \"I leave the machine on sometimes when I\u0027m home,\" she explained, \"so I can see who it is before I answer. I haven\u0027t heard from Chance since I spoke to you earlier.\" \"I just left him a few minutes ago.\" \"You saw him?\" \"We rode around in his car.\" \"What did you think?\" \"I think he\u0027s a good driver.\" \"I meant-\" \"I know what you meant. He didn\u0027t seem terribly upset to hear that you want to leave him. He assured me that you\u0027ve got nothing to fear from him. According to him, you didn\u0027t need me as your champion. All you had to do was tell him.\" \"Yes, well, he\u0027d say that.\" \"You don\u0027t think it\u0027s true?\" \"Maybe it is.\" \"He said he wants to hear it from you, and I gather he also wants to make some arrangements about your leaving the apartment. I don\u0027t know if you\u0027re afraid to be alone with him or not.\" \"I don\u0027t know either.\" \"You can keep the door locked and talk to him through it.\" \"He has keys.\" \"Don\u0027t you have a chain lock?\" \"Yes.\" \"You can use that.\" \"I suppose.\" \"Shall I come over?\" \"No, you don\u0027t have to do that. Oh, I suppose you want the rest of the money, don\u0027t you?\" \"Not until you\u0027ve talked to him and everything\u0027s settled. But I\u0027ll come over there if you want somebody on your side when he turns up.\" \"Is he coming tonight?\" \"I don\u0027t know when he\u0027s coming. Maybe he\u0027ll handle the whole thing over the phone.\" \"He might not come until tomorrow.\" \"Well, I could hole up on the couch if you wanted.\" \"Do you think it\u0027s necessary?\" \"Well, it is if you think it is, Kim. If you\u0027re uncomfortable-\" \"Do you think I have anything to be afraid of?\" I thought for a moment, replayed the scene with Chance, assessed my own reactions after the fact. \"No,\" I said. \"I don\u0027t think so. But I don\u0027t really know the man.\" \"Neither do I.\" \"If you\u0027re nervous-\" \"No, it\u0027s silly. Anyway it\u0027s late. I\u0027m watching a movie on cable, but when it ends I\u0027m going to sleep. I\u0027ll put the chain lock on. That\u0027s a good idea.\" \"You\u0027ve got my number.\" \"Yes.\" \"Call me if anything happens, or if you just want to call me. All right?\" \"Sure.\" \"Just to put your mind at rest, I think you spent some money you didn\u0027t have to spend, but it was money you held out so maybe it doesn\u0027t matter.\" \"Absolutely.\" \"The point is I think you\u0027re off the hook. He\u0027s not going to hurt you.\" \"I think you\u0027re right. I\u0027ll probably call you tomorrow. And Matt? Thanks.\" \"Get some sleep,\" I said. I went upstairs and tried to take my own advice but I was wired. I gave up and got dressed and went around the corner to Armstrong\u0027s. I would have had something to eat but the kitchen was closed. Trina told me she could get me a piece of pie if I wanted. I didn\u0027t want a piece of pie. I wanted two ounces of bourbon, neat, and another two ounces in my coffee, and I couldn\u0027t think of a single goddamned reason not to have it. It wouldn\u0027t get me drunk. It wouldn\u0027t put me back in the hospital. That had been the result of a bout of uncontrolled round-the-clock drinking, and I\u0027d learned my lesson. I couldn\u0027t drink that way anymore, not safely, and I didn\u0027t intend to. But there was a fairly substantial difference between a nightcap and going out on a toot, wasn\u0027t there? They tell you not to drink for ninety days. You\u0027re supposed to go to ninety meetings in ninety days and stay away from the first drink one day at a time, and after ninety days you can decide what you want to do next. I\u0027d had my last drink Sunday night. I\u0027d been to four meetings since then, and if I went to bed without a drink I\u0027d have five days. So? I had one cup of coffee, and on the way back to the hotel I stopped at the Greek deli and picked up a cheese danish and a half pint of milk. I ate the pastry and drank a little of the milk in my room. I turned out the light, got into bed. Now I had five days. So? Chapter 5 I read the paper while I ate breakfast. The housing cop in Corona was still in critical condition but his doctors now said they expected him to live. They said there might be some paralysis, which in turn might be permanent. It was too early to tell. In Grand Central Station, someone had mugged a shopping-bag lady and had stolen two of her three bags. And, in the Gravesend section of Brooklyn, a father and son with arrest records for pornography and what the paper described as links to organized crime bolted from a car and sought sanctuary in the first house they could run to. Their pursuers opened up on them with pistols and a shotgun. The father was wounded, the son was shot dead, and the young wife and mother who\u0027d just recently moved into the house was hanging something in a hall closet when enough of the shotgun blast came through the door to take most of her head off. They have noon meetings six days a week at the YMCA on Sixty-third Street. The speaker said, \"Just let me tell you how I got here. I woke up one morning and I said to myself, \u0027Hey, it\u0027s a beautiful day and I never felt better in my life. My health\u0027s tiptop, my marriage is in great shape, my career\u0027s going beautifully, and my state of mind has never been better. I think I\u0027ll go join AA.\u0027 \" The room rocked with laughter. After his talk they didn\u0027t go around the room. You raised your hand and the speaker called on you. One young fellow said shyly that he\u0027d just reached ninety days. He got a lot of applause. I thought about raising my hand and tried to figure out what I might say. All I could think to talk about was the woman in Gravesend, or perhaps Lou Rudenko\u0027s mother, slain by a salvaged television set. But what did either of those deaths have to do with me? I was still looking for something to say when time ran out and we all stood up and said the Lord\u0027s Prayer. It was just as well. I probably wouldn\u0027t have gotten around to raising my hand anyway. After the meeting I walked for awhile in Central Park. The sun was out for a change and it was the first good day all week. I took a good long walk and watched the kids and the runners and the cyclists and the roller skaters and tried to reconcile all that wholesome innocent energy with the dark face of the city that showed itself every morning in the newspaper. The two worlds overlap. Some of these riders would be robbed of their bicycles. Some of these strolling lovers would return home to burglarized apartments. Some of these laughing kids would pull holdups, and shoot or stab, and some would be held up or shot or stabbed, and a person could give himself a headache trying to make sense out of it.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/eight-million-ways-to-die-matthew-scudder-5/page-7.html","bookId":2323,"book":{"id":2323,"title":"Eight Million Ways to Die (Matthew Scudder #5)","description":"Storyline: Eight Million Ways to Die (Matthew Scudder #5) Nobody knows better than Matthew Scudder how far down a person can sink in this city.
