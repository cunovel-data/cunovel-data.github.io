But I\u0027ve never tried that sort of thing, and I\u0027ve somehow always known I never will. I\u0027m either too scared or too stubborn, or perhaps my particular despair is never as unequivocal as I think it is. Something seems to keep me going.\\n\\n Of course all bets were off if I drank. I\u0027d heard a man at a meeting who told of coming out of a blackout on the Brooklyn Bridge. He was over the railing and he had one foot in space when he came to. He retrieved the foot, climbed back over the railing, and got the hell out of there.\\n\\n Suppose he\u0027d come to a second later, with both feet in the air.\\n\\n If I drank I\u0027d feel better.\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t get the thought out of my head. The worst of it was that I knew it was true. I felt horrible, and if I had a drink the feeling would go away. I\u0027d regret it in the long run, I\u0027d feel as bad and worse again in the long run, but so what? In the long run we\u0027re all dead.\\n\\n I remembered something I\u0027d heard at a meeting. Mary, one of the regulars at St. Paul\u0027s, had said it. She was a birdlike woman with a tiny voice, always well dressed and well groomed and soft-spoken. I\u0027d heard her qualify once, and evidently she\u0027d been the next thing to a shopping-bag lady before she hit bottom.\\n\\n One night, speaking from the floor, she\u0027d said, \"You know, it was a revelation to me to learn that I don\u0027t have to be comfortable. Nowhere is it written that I must be comfortable. I always thought if I felt nervous or anxious or unhappy I had to do something about it. But I learned that\u0027s not true. Bad feelings won\u0027t kill me. Alcohol will kill me, but my feelings won\u0027t.\"\\n\\n The train plunged into the tunnel. As it dropped below ground level all the lights went out for a moment. Then they came back on again. I could hear Mary, pronouncing each word very precisely. I could see her, her fine-boned hands resting one on top of the other in her lap as she spoke.\\n\\n Funny what comes to mind.\\n\\n When I emerged from the subway station at Columbus Circle I still wanted a drink. I walked past a couple of bars and went to my meeting.\\n\\n The speaker was a big beefy Irishman from Bay Ridge. He looked like a cop, and it turned out he\u0027d been one, retiring after twenty years and currently supplementing his city pension as a security guard. Alcohol never interfered with his job or his marriage, but after a certain number of years it began to get to him physically. His capacity decreased, his hangovers worsened, and a doctor told him his liver was enlarged.\\n\\n \"He told me the booze was threatening my life,\" he said. \"Well, I wasn\u0027t some derelict, I wasn\u0027t some degenerate drunk, I wasn\u0027t some guy who had to drink to get rid of the blues. I was just your normal happy-go-lucky guy who liked a shot an\u0027 a beer after work and a six-pack in front of the television set. So if it\u0027s gonna kill me, the hell with it, right? I walked out of that doctor\u0027s office and resolved to stop drinking. And eight years later that\u0027s just what I did.\"\\n\\n A drunk kept interrupting the qualification. He was a well-dressed man and he didn\u0027t seem to want to make trouble. He just seemed incapable of listening quietly, and after his fifth or sixth outburst a couple of members escorted him out and the meeting went on.\\n\\n I thought how I\u0027d come to the meeting myself in blackout. God, had I been like that?\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t keep my mind on what I was hearing. I thought about Octavio Calderуn and I thought about Sunny Hendryx and I thought how little I\u0027d accomplished. I\u0027d been just a little bit out of synch from the very beginning. I could have seen Sunny before she killed herself. She might have done it anyway, I wasn\u0027t going to carry the weight for her self-destruction, but I could have learned something from her first.\\n\\n And I could have talked to Calderуn before he did his disappearing act. I\u0027d asked for him on my first visit to the hotel, then forgot about him when he proved temporarily unavailable. Maybe I couldn\u0027t have gotten anything out of him, but at least I might have sensed that he was holding something back. But it didn\u0027t occur to me to pursue him until he\u0027d already checked out and headed for the woods.\\n\\n My timing was terrible. I was always a day late and a dollar short, and it struck me that it wasn\u0027t just this one case. It was the story of my life.\\n\\n Poor me, poor me, pour me a drink.\\n\\n During the discussion, a woman named Grace got a round of applause when she said it was her second anniversary. I clapped for her, and when the applause died down I counted up and realized today was my seventh day. If I went to bed sober, I\u0027d have seven days.\\n\\n How far did I get before my last drink? Eight days?\\n\\n Maybe I could break that record. Or maybe I couldn\u0027t, maybe I\u0027d drink tomorrow.\\n\\n Not tonight, though. I was all right for tonight. I didn\u0027t feel any better than I\u0027d felt before the meeting. My opinion of myself was certainly no higher. All the numbers on the scorecard were the same, but earlier they\u0027d added up to a drink and now they didn\u0027t.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t know why that was. But I knew I was safe.\\n\\n Chapter 26\\n\\n There was a message at the desk to call Danny Boy Bell. I dialed the number on the slip and the man who answered said, \"Poogan\u0027s Pub.\" I asked for Danny Boy and waited until he came on the line.\\n\\n He said, \"Matt, I think you should come up and let me buy you a ginger ale. That\u0027s what I think you should do.\"\\n\\n \"Now?\"\\n\\n \"What better time?\"\\n\\n I was almost out of the door when I turned, went upstairs, and got the.32 out of my dresser. I didn\u0027t really think Danny Boy would set me up but I didn\u0027t want to bet my life that he wouldn\u0027t. Either way, you never knew who might be drinking in Poogan\u0027s.\\n\\n I\u0027d received a warning last night and I\u0027d spent the intervening hours disregarding it. And the clerk who gave me Danny Boy\u0027s message had volunteered that I\u0027d had a couple of other calls from people who\u0027d declined to leave their names. They might have been friends of the chap in the lumber jacket, calling to offer a word to the wise.\\n\\n I dropped the gun into a pocket, went out and hailed a cab.\\n\\n Danny Boy insisted on buying the drinks, vodka for himself, ginger ale for me. He looked as natty as ever, and he\u0027d been to the barber since I last saw him. His cap of tight white curls was closer to his scalp, and his manicured nails showed a coating of clear polish.\\n\\n He said, \"I\u0027ve got two things for you. A message and an opinion.\"\\n\\n \"Oh?\"\\n\\n \"The message first. It\u0027s a warning.\"\\n\\n \"I thought it might be.\"\\n\\n \"You should forget about the Dakkinen girl.\"\\n\\n \"Or what?\"\\n\\n \"Or what? Or else, I suppose. Or you get what she got, something like that. You want a specific warning so you can decide whether it\u0027s worth it or not?\"\\n\\n \"Who\u0027s the warning come from, Danny?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know.\"\\n\\n \"What spoke to you? A burning bush?\"\\n\\n He drank off some of his vodka. \"Somebody talked to somebody who talked to somebody who talked to me.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s pretty roundabout.\"\\n\\n \"Isn\u0027t it? I could give you the person who talked to me, but I won\u0027t, because I don\u0027t do that. And even if I did it wouldn\u0027t do you any good, because you probably couldn\u0027t find him, and if you did he still wouldn\u0027t talk to you, and meanwhile somebody\u0027s probably going to whack you out. You want another ginger ale?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve still got most of this one.\"\\n\\n \"So you do. I don\u0027t know who the warning\u0027s from, Matt, but from the messenger they used I\u0027d guess it\u0027s some very heavy types. And what\u0027s interesting is I get absolutely nowhere trying to find anybody who saw Dakkinen on the town with anybody but our friend Chance. Now if she\u0027s going with somebody with all this firepower, you\u0027d think he\u0027d show her around, wouldn\u0027t you? Why not?\"\\n\\n I nodded. For that matter, why would she need me to ease her out of Chance\u0027s string?\\n\\n \"Anyway,\" he was saying, \"that\u0027s the message. You want the opinion?\"\\n\\n \"Sure.\"\\n\\n \"The opinion is I think you should heed the message. Either I\u0027m getting old in a hurry or this town\u0027s gotten nastier in the past couple of years. People seem to pull the trigger a lot quicker than they used to. They used to need more of a reason to kill. You know what I mean?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"Now they\u0027ll do it unless they\u0027ve got a reason not to. They\u0027ll sooner kill than not. It\u0027s an automatic response. I\u0027ll tell you, it scares me.\"\\n\\n \"It scares everybody.\"\\n\\n \"You had a little scene uptown a few nights back, didn\u0027t you? Or was somebody making up stories?\"\\n\\n \"What did you hear?\"\\n\\n \"Just that a brother jumped you in the alley and wound up with multiple fractures.\"\\n\\n \"News travels.\"\\n\\n \"It does for a fact. Of course there\u0027s more dangerous things in this city than a young punk on angel dust.\"\\n\\n \"Is that what he was on?\"\\n\\n \"Aren\u0027t they all? I don\u0027t know. I stick to basics, myself.\" He underscored the line with a sip of his vodka. \"About Dakkinen,\" he said. \"I could pass a message back up the line.\"\\n\\n \"What kind of message?\"\\n\\n \"That you\u0027re letting it lay.\"\\n\\n \"That might not be true, Danny Boy.\"\\n\\n \"Matt-\"\\n\\n \"You remember Jack Benny?\"\\n\\n \"Do I remember Jack Benny? Of course I remember Jack Benny.\"\\n\\n \"Remember that bit with the stickup man? The guy says, \u0027Your money or your life,\u0027 and there\u0027s a long pause, a really long pause, and Benny says, \u0027I\u0027m thinking it over.\u0027 \"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the answer? You\u0027re thinking it over?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the answer.\"\\n\\n Outside on Seventy-second Street I stood in the shadows in the doorway of a stationery store, waiting to see if anyone would follow me out of Poogan\u0027s. I stood there for a full five minutes and thought about what Danny Boy had said. A couple of people left Poogan\u0027s while I was standing there but they didn\u0027t look like anything I had to worry about.\\n\\n I went to the curb to hail a cab, then decided I might as well walk half a block to Columbus and get one going in the right direction. By the time I got to the corner I decided it was a nice night and I was in no hurry, and an easy stroll fifteen blocks down Columbus Avenue would probably do me good, make sleep come that much easier. I crossed the street and headed downtown and before I\u0027d covered a block I noticed that my hand was in my coat pocket and I was holding onto the little gun.\\n\\n Funny. No one had followed me. What the hell was I afraid of?\\n\\n Just something in the air.\\n\\n I kept walking, displaying all the street smarts I hadn\u0027t shown Saturday night. I stayed at the edge of the sidewalk near the curb, keeping my distance from buildings and doorways. I looked left and right, and now and then I turned to see if anyone was moving up behind me. And I went on clutching the gun, my finger resting lightly alongside the trigger.\\n\\n I crossed Broadway, walked on past Lincoln Center and O\u0027Neal\u0027s. I was on the dark block between Sixtieth and Sixty-first, across the street from Fordham, when I heard the car behind me and spun around. It was slanting across the wide avenue toward me and had cut off a cab. Maybe it was his brakes I heard, maybe that\u0027s what made me turn.\\n\\n I threw myself down on the pavement, rolled away from the street toward the buildings, came up with the.32 in my hand. The car was even with me now, its wheels straightened out. I\u0027d thought it was going to vault the curb but it wasn\u0027t. And the windows were open and someone was leaning out the rear window, looking my way, and he had something in his hand- \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/eight-million-ways-to-die-matthew-scudder-5/page-36.html","bookId":2323,"book":{"id":2323,"title":"Eight Million Ways to Die (Matthew Scudder #5)","description":"Storyline: Eight Million Ways to Die (Matthew Scudder #5) \\n Nobody knows better than Matthew Scudder how far down a person can sink in this city.
