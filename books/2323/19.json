Any compunctions he had about having a pimp\u0027s money pay for his booze seemed to have been dissolved by the same alcohol that had given rise to them. He was visibly drunk now, but only if you knew where to look. The eyes had a glaze on them, and there was a matching glaze on his whole manner. He was holding up his end of a typical alcoholic conversation, wherein two drunks take polite turns talking aloud to their own selves.\n I wouldn\u0027t have noticed this if I\u0027d been matching him drink for drink. But I was sober, and as the booze got to him I felt the gulf widening between us.\n I tried to keep the conversation on the subject of Kim Dakkinen but it wouldn\u0027t stay there. He wanted to talk about everything that was wrong with New York.\n \"You know what it is,\" he said, leaning forward, lowering his voice, as if we weren\u0027t the only two customers in the bar by now, just us and the bartender. \"I\u0027ll tell you what it is. It\u0027s niggers.\"\n I didn\u0027t say anything.\n \"And spics. The blacks and the Hispanics.\"\n I said something about black and Puerto Rican cops. He rode right over it. \"Listen, don\u0027t tell me,\" he said. \"I got a guy I been partnered with a lot, Larry Haynes his name is, maybe you know him-\" I didn\u0027t \"- and he\u0027s as good as they come. I\u0027d trust the man with my life. Shit, I have trusted him with my life. He\u0027s black as coal and I never met a better man in or out of the department. But that\u0027s got nothing to do with what I\u0027m talking about.\" He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. \"Look,\" he said, \"you ever ride the subway?\"\n \"When I have to.\"\n \"Well, shit, nobody rides it by choice. It\u0027s the whole city in a nutshell, the equipment breaks down all the time, the cars are filthy with spray paint and they stink of piss and the transit cops can\u0027t make a dent in the crime down there, but what I\u0027m talking about, shit, I get on a subway and I look around and you know where I am? I\u0027m in a fucking foreign country.\"\n \"What do you mean?\"\n \"I mean everybody\u0027s black or Spanish. Or oriental, we got all these new Chinese immigrants coming in, plus there\u0027s the Koreans. Now the Koreans are perfect citizens, they open up all these great vegetable markets all over the city, they work twenty hours a day and send their kids to college, but it\u0027s all part of something.\"\n \"Part of what?\"\n \"Oh, shit, it sounds ignorant and bigoted but I can\u0027t help it. This used to be a white city and now there\u0027s days when I feel like I\u0027m the only white man left in it.\"\n The silence stretched. Then he said, \"They smoke on the subway now. You ever notice?\"\n \"I\u0027ve noticed.\"\n \"Never used to happen. A guy might murder both his parents with a fire axe but he wouldn\u0027t dare light up a cigarette on the subway. Now you got middle-class people lighting their cigarettes, puffing away. Just in the last few months. You know how it started?\"\n \"How?\"\n \"Remember about a year ago? A guy was smoking on the PATH train and a PATH cop asked him to put it out, and the guy drew a gun and shot the cop dead? Remember?\"\n \"I remember.\"\n \"That\u0027s what started it. You read about that and whoever you are, a cop or a private citizen, you\u0027re not in a rush to tell the guy across the aisle to put out his fucking cigarette. So a few people light up and nobody does anything about it, and more people do it, and who\u0027s gonna give a shit about smoking in the subway when it\u0027s a waste of time to report a major crime like burglary? Stop enforcing a law and people stop respecting it.\" He frowned. \"But think about that PATH cop. You like that for a way to die? Ask a guy to put out a cigarette and bang, you\u0027re dead.\"\n I found myself telling him about Rudenko\u0027s mother, dead of a bomb blast because her friend had brought home the wrong television set. And so we traded horror stories. He told of a social worker, lured onto a tenement roof, raped repeatedly and thrown off the building to her death. I recalled something I\u0027d read about a fourteen-year-old shot by another boy the same age, both of them strangers to each other, the killer insisted that his victim had laughed at him. Durkin told me about some child-abuse cases that had ended in death, and about a man who had smothered his girlfriend\u0027s infant daughter because he was sick of paying for a baby-sitter everytime the two of them went to the movies. I mentioned the woman in Gravesend, dead of a shotgun blast while she hung clothes in her closet. There was an air of Can You Top This? to our dialogue.\n He said, \"The mayor thinks he\u0027s got the answer. The death penalty. Bring back the big black chair.\"\n \"Think it\u0027ll happen?\"\n \"No question the public wants it. And there\u0027s one way it works and you can\u0027t tell me it doesn\u0027t. You fry one of these bastards and at least you know he\u0027s not gonna do it again. The hell, I\u0027d vote for it. Bring back the chair and televise the fucking executions, run commercials, make a few dollars and hire a few more cops. You want to know something?\"\n \"What?\"\n \"We got the death penalty. Not for murderers. For ordinary citizens. Everybody out there runs a better chance of getting killed than a killer does of getting the chair. We get the death penalty five, six, seven times a day.\"\n He had raised his voice and the bartender was auditing our conversation now. We\u0027d lured him away from his program.\n Durkin said, \"I like the one about the exploding television set. I don\u0027t know how I missed that one. You think you heard \u0027em all but there\u0027s always something new, isn\u0027t there?\"\n \"I guess.\"\n \"There are eight million stories in the naked city,\" he intoned. \"You remember that program? Used to be on television some years back.\"\n \"I remember.\"\n \"They had that line at the end of every show. \u0027There are eight million stories in the naked city. This has been one of them.\u0027 \"\n \"I remember it.\"\n \"Eight million stories,\" he said. \"You know what you got in this city, this fucked-up toilet of a naked fucking city? You know what you got? You got eight million ways to die.\"\n I got him out of there. Outside in the cool night air he fell silent. We circled a couple of blocks, wound up down the street from the station house. His car was a Mercury a few years old. It had been beaten up a little around the corners. The license plate had a prefix which would indicate to other cops that this was a vehicle used for police business and not to be ticketed. Some of the more knowledgeable crooks could also recognize it as a cop\u0027s car.\n I asked if he was okay to drive. He didn\u0027t much care for the question. He said, \"What are you, a cop?\" and then the absurdity of the remark struck him and he started to laugh. He clung to the car\u0027s open door for support, helpless with laughter, and swung back and forth on the car door. \"What are you, a cop?\" he said, giggling. \"What are you, a cop?\"\n That mood passed like a fast cut in a film. In an instant he was serious and apparently sober, eyes narrowed, jaw thrust forward like a bulldog\u0027s. \"Listen,\" he said, voice low and hard. \"Don\u0027t be so goddamn superior, you understand?\"\n I didn\u0027t know what he was talking about.\n \"You sanctimonious bastard. You\u0027re no better than I am, you son of a bitch.\"\n He pulled out and drove off. He seemed to be driving all right for as far as I was able to track him. I hoped he didn\u0027t have too far to go.\n Chapter 15\n I walked straight back to my hotel. The liquor stores were closed but the bars were still open. I passed them without much effort, resisted too the call of street whores on Fifty-seventh Street on either side of the Holiday Inn. I gave Jacob a nod, confirmed that I\u0027d had no calls, and went upstairs.\n Sanctimonious bastard. No better than I am. He\u0027d been ugly drunk, with that defensive belligerence of the drinker who had exposed too much of himself. His words didn\u0027t mean anything. He\u0027d have addressed them to any companion, or to the night itself.\n Still, they echoed in my head.\n I got into bed but couldn\u0027t sleep, got up and put the light on and sat on the edge of the bed with my notebook. I looked over some of the notes I made, then jotted down a point or two from our conversation in the bar on Tenth Avenue. I made a few further notes to myself, playing with ideas like a kitten with a yarn ball. I put the notebook down when the process reached a point of diminishing returns, with the same thoughts turning over and over upon themselves. I picked up a paperback I\u0027d bought earlier but couldn\u0027t get into it. I kept reading the same paragraph without getting the sense of it.\n For the first time in hours I really wanted a drink. I was anxious and edgy and wanted to change it. There was a deli with a cooler full of beer just three doors from the hotel, and when had beer ever led me into a blackout?\n I stayed where I was.\n Chance hadn\u0027t asked my reason for working for him. Durkin had accepted money as a valid motive. Elaine was willing to believe I was doing it because it was what I did, even as she turned tricks and God pardoned sinners. And it was all true, I could indeed use the money and detecting was what I did insofar as I did anything, it was as much of a profession as I had.\n But I had another motive, and perhaps it was a deeper one. Searching for Kim\u0027s killer was something I could do instead of drinking.\n For awhile, anyway.\n When I woke up the sun was shining. By the time I showered and shaved and hit the street it was gone, tucked away behind a bank of clouds. It came and went all day, as if whoever was in charge didn\u0027t want to commit himself.\n I ate a light breakfast, made some phone calls, then walked over to the Galaxy Downtowner. The clerk who\u0027d checked in Charles Jones wasn\u0027t on duty. I\u0027d read his interrogation report in the file and didn\u0027t really expect I could get more out of him than the cops could.\n An assistant manager let me look at Jones\u0027s registration card. He\u0027d printed \"Charles Owen Jones\" on the line marked \"Name,\" and on the \"Signature\" line he\u0027d printed \"C. O. JONES\" in block capitals. I pointed this out to the assistant manager, who told me the discrepancy was common. \"People will put their full name on one line and a shorter version on the other,\" he said. \"Either way is legal.\"\n \"But this isn\u0027t a signature.\"\n \"Why not?\"\n \"He printed it.\"\n He shrugged. \"Some people print everything,\" he said. \"The fellow made a telephone reservation and paid cash in advance. I wouldn\u0027t expect my people to question a signature under such circumstances.\"\n That wasn\u0027t my point. What had struck me was that Jones had managed to avoid leaving a specimen of his handwriting, and I found that interesting. I looked at the name where he\u0027d printed it in full. The first three letters of Charles, I found myself thinking, were also the first three letters of Chance. And what, pray tell, did that signify? And why look for ways to hang my own client?\n I asked if there\u0027d been any previous visits by our Mr. Jones in the past few months. \"Nothing in the past year,\" he assured me. \"We carry previous registrations alphabetically in our computer and one of the detectives had that information checked. If that\u0027s all-\"\n \"How many other guests signed their names in block caps?\"\n \"I\u0027ve no idea.\"\n \"Suppose you let me look through the registration cards for the past two, three months.\"\n \"To look for what?\"\n \"People who print like this guy.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/eight-million-ways-to-die-matthew-scudder-5/page-19.html","bookId":2323,"book":{"id":2323,"title":"Eight Million Ways to Die (Matthew Scudder #5)","description":"Storyline: \n Eight Million Ways to Die (Matthew Scudder #5) \n Nobody knows better than Matthew Scudder how far down a person can sink in this city.
