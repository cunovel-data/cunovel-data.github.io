A young prostitute named Kim knew it also—and she wanted out. Maybe Kim didn\u0027t deserve the life fate had dealt her. She surely didn\u0027t deserve her death. The alcoholic ex-cop turned p.i. was supposed to protect her, but someone slashed her to ribbons on a crumbling New York City waterfront pier. Now finding Kim\u0027s killer will be Scudder\u0027s penance. But there are lethal secrets hiding in the slain hooker\u0027s past that are far dirtier than her trade. And there are many ways of dying in this cruel and dangerous town—some quick and brutal ... and some agonizingly slow.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/eight-million-ways-to-die-matthew-scudder-5.jpg","author":"Lawrence Block","type":"Mystery","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":49,"category":{"id":19,"name":"Mystery","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
