He must have told Kim something because on the strength of it she told Chance she wanted out. She wasn\u0027t going to be turning tricks anymore. If I were going to guess, I\u0027d say he did a switch and went out of the country to unload the good stuff. Kim got herself free of Chance while he was gone, and when he got back it was going to be Happily Ever After time. But he never came back.\"\n \"If he never came back, who killed her?\"\n \"The people he crossed. They decoyed her to that room at the Galaxy Downtowner. She probably thought she was going to be meeting him there. She wasn\u0027t hooking anymore, she wouldn\u0027t have gone to a hotel room to meet a john. In fact she\u0027d never been much on hotel tricks. But suppose she gets a call from somebody who says he\u0027s a friend and the boyfriend\u0027s afraid to come to her place because he thinks he\u0027s being followed, so would she please meet him at the hotel?\"\n \"And she went.\"\n \"Sure she went. She got all dressed up, she wore the presents he gave her, the mink jacket and the emerald ring. The jacket wasn\u0027t worth a fortune because the guy wasn\u0027t rich, he didn\u0027t have money to burn, but he could give her a terrific emerald because the emeralds didn\u0027t cost him anything. He was in the business, he could take one of those smuggled stones and have it set in a ring for her.\"\n \"So she went over and got killed.\"\n \"Right.\"\n Danny Boy drank some vodka. \"Why? You figure they killed her to get the ring back?\"\n \"No. They killed her to kill her.\"\n \"Why?\"\n \"Because they were Colombians,\" I said, \"and that\u0027s how they do it. When they have a reason to hit somebody they go for the whole family.\"\n \"Jesus.\"\n \"Maybe they figure it\u0027s a deterrent,\" I said. \"I could see where it might be. The cases make the papers pretty regularly, especially in Miami. A whole family gets waxed because somebody burned somebody else in a coke deal. Colombia\u0027s a rich little country. They\u0027ve got the best coffee, the best marijuana, the best cocaine.\"\n \"And the best emeralds?\"\n \"That\u0027s right. Kim\u0027s jeweler wasn\u0027t a married guy. I figured he was, that\u0027s why he was so hard to get a line on, but he never married. Maybe he never fell in love until he fell in love with Kim, and maybe that\u0027s why he was ready to kick his life over. Anyway, he was a bachelor. No wife, no kids, no living parents. You want to rub out his family, what do you do? You kill his girlfriend.\"\n Bryna\u0027s face was as white as her hair now. She didn\u0027t like stories where they killed the girlfriend.\n \"The killing was pretty professional,\" I went on, \"in that the killer was careful about evidence. He covered his tracks pretty well. But something made him do a butcher job instead of a couple of quick bullets from a silenced handgun. Maybe he had a thing about prostitutes, or maybe it was women in general. One way or another, he went and did a number on Kim.\n \"Then he cleaned up, packed the dirty towels along with the machete, and got out of there. He left the fur jacket and he left the money in the purse but he took her ring.\"\n \"Because it was worth so much money?\"\n \"Possibly. There\u0027s no hard evidence on the ring, and for all I know it was cut glass and she bought it for herself. But it might have been an emerald, and even if it wasn\u0027t the killer might have thought it was. It\u0027s one thing to leave a few hundred dollars on a dead body to show you don\u0027t rob the dead. It\u0027s something else to leave an emerald that might be worth fifty thousand dollars, especially if it\u0027s your emerald in the first place.\"\n \"I follow you.\"\n \"The room clerk at the Galaxy Downtowner was a Colombian, a young kid named Octavio Calderуn. Maybe that was a coincidence. There are a lot of Colombians in town these days. Maybe the killer picked the Galaxy because he knew somebody who worked there. It doesn\u0027t matter. Calderуn probably recognized the killer, or at least knew enough about him to keep his mouth shut. When a cop came back to have another talk with him, Calderуn disappeared. Either the killer\u0027s friends told him to disappear or Calderуn decided he\u0027d be safer somewhere else. Back home in Cartagena, say, or another rooming house in another part of Queens.\"\n Or maybe he got killed, I thought. That was possible, too. But I didn\u0027t think so. When these people killed, they liked to leave the corpses in plain sight.\n \"There was another whore that got killed.\"\n \"Sunny Hendryx,\" I said. \"That was a suicide. Maybe Kim\u0027s death triggered that, so maybe the man who killed Kim has some moral responsibility for Sunny\u0027s death. But she killed herself.\"\n \"I\u0027m talking about the street hustler. The TV.\"\n \"Cookie Blue.\"\n \"That\u0027s the one. Why did she get killed? To throw you off the track? Except you weren\u0027t on the track to begin with.\"\n \"No.\"\n \"Then why? You think the first killing turned the killer nuts? Triggered something in him that made him want to do it again?\"\n \"I think that\u0027s part of it,\" I said. \"Nobody would do a second butcher job like that unless he enjoyed the first one. I don\u0027t know if he had sex with either of his victims, but the kick he got out of the killings had to be sexual.\"\n \"So he just picked up Cookie for the hell of it?\"\n Bryna blanched again. It was bad enough hearing about someone who got killed for being the wrong person\u0027s girl- friend. It was even worse hearing about a girl getting killed at random.\n \"No,\" I said, \"Cookie was killed for a specific reason. The killer went looking for her and passed up a batch of other streetwalkers until he found her. Cookie was family.\"\n \"Family? Whose family?\"\n \"The boyfriend\u0027s.\"\n \"He had two sweeties, this jeweler? A call girl and a transvestite hustler?\"\n \"Cookie wasn\u0027t his sweetie. Cookie was his brother.\"\n \"Cookie-\"\n \"Cookie Blue started life as Mark Blaustein. Mark had an older brother named Adrian who went into the jewelry business. Adrian Blaustein had a girlfriend named Kim and some business associates from Colombia.\"\n \"So Cookie and Kim were connected.\"\n \"They had to be connected. I\u0027m sure they never met each other. I don\u0027t think Mark and Adrian had any contact in recent years. That may explain why it took the killer so long to find Cookie. But I knew there had to be some kind of link. I told someone earlier that they were sisters under the skin. That wasn\u0027t far off. They were almost sisters-in-law.\"\n He thought about this, then told Bryna to give us a few moments alone. This time I didn\u0027t interfere. She left the table and Danny Boy motioned to the waitress. He ordered vodka for himself and asked me what I wanted.\n \"Nothing right now,\" I said.\n When she brought back the vodka he took a careful little sip and set the glass down. \"You\u0027ve been to the cops,\" he said.\n \"No cops.\"\n \"Why not?\"\n \"Just didn\u0027t get around to it yet.\"\n \"You had to come here instead.\"\n \"That\u0027s right.\"\n \"I can keep my mouth shut, Matt, but Bryna the Vagina wouldn\u0027t know how. She thinks unexpressed thoughts build up inside your head and explode your skull, and she\u0027s not taking any chances. Anyway, you were talking loud enough for half the room to pick up on what you were saying.\"\n \"I know that.\"\n \"I figured you did. What do you want?\"\n \"I want the killer to know what I know.\"\n \"That shouldn\u0027t take long.\"\n \"I want you to pass it on, Danny Boy. I\u0027m leaving here, I\u0027m walking back to my neighborhood. I\u0027ll probably spend a couple of hours in Armstrong\u0027s. Then I\u0027ll walk around the corner to my room.\"\n \"You\u0027re gonna get killed, Matt.\"\n \"This fucker only kills girls,\" I said.\n \"Cookie was only half a girl. Maybe he\u0027s working his way up to men.\"\n \"Maybe.\"\n \"You want him to make a move on you.\"\n \"Looks that way, doesn\u0027t it?\"\n \"Looks to me as though you\u0027re crazy, Matt. I tried to head you off the minute you came over here. Tried to cool you down some.\"\n \"I know.\"\n \"It\u0027s probably too late now. Whether I pass it on or not.\"\n \"It was too late before then. I was uptown before I came down here. You know a man named Royal Waldron?\"\n \"Sure, I know Royal.\"\n \"He and I talked some. Royal\u0027s been known to do a little business with some fellows from Colombia.\"\n \"He would,\" Danny Boy said. \"The business he\u0027s in.\"\n \"So they probably already know. But you could pass it on anyway, just for insurance.\"\n \"Insurance,\" he said. \"What\u0027s the opposite of life insurance?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know.\"\n \"Death insurance. They may be waiting outside for you right now, Matt.\"\n \"It\u0027s possible.\"\n \"Why don\u0027t you go pick up the phone and call the cops? They could send a car and you go somewhere and make a statement. Let the bastards earn their money.\"\n \"I want the killer,\" I said. \"I want him one-on-one.\"\n \"You\u0027re not Latin. Where\u0027d you get this macho hangup?\"\n \"Just pass the word, Danny Boy.\"\n \"Sit down a minute.\" He leaned forward, dropped his voice. \"You don\u0027t want to walk out of here without a piece. Just sit here a minute and I\u0027ll get you something.\"\n \"I don\u0027t need a gun.\"\n \"No, of course not. Who needs one? You can take his machete away from him and make him eat it. Then break both his legs and leave him in an alley.\"\n \"Something like that.\"\n \"Will you let me get you a gun?\" His eyes searched mine. \"You\u0027ve already got one,\" he said. \"On you, right now. Haven\u0027t you?\"\n \"I don\u0027t need a gun,\" I said.\n And I didn\u0027t. On the way out of the Top Knot I put my hand in my pocket and felt the butt and barrel of the little.32. Who needed it? A little gun like that doesn\u0027t have a whole lot of stopping power anyway.\n Especially when you can\u0027t make yourself squeeze the trigger.\n I went outside. It was still raining but no harder than before. I tugged the brim of my hat and took a good look around.\n The Mercury sedan was parked on the other side of the street. I recognized it by its crimped fenders. While I was standing there the driver started the engine.\n I walked over to Columbus Avenue. While I waited for the light to change I saw that the Mercury had come around in a U-turn and was approaching. The light changed and I walked across the street.\n I had the gun in my hand and my hand in my pocket. My index finger was on the trigger. I remembered how the trigger had trembled beneath my finger not too long ago.\n I\u0027d been on this same street then.\n I walked on downtown. A couple of times I looked over my shoulder. The Mercury stayed a little less than a block behind me all the way.\n I never relaxed, but I was especially tense when I got to the block where I\u0027d drawn the gun once before. I couldn\u0027t help looking back, expecting to see a car careening toward me. I spun around involuntarily once at the sound of brakes screeching, then realized the sound was a good two blocks away.\n Nerves.\n I passed the spot where I\u0027d dropped to the pavement and rolled. I checked the place where the bottle had broken. There was still some broken glass there, though I couldn\u0027t be sure it was the same broken glass. A lot of bottles get broken every day. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/eight-million-ways-to-die-matthew-scudder-5/page-46.html","bookId":2323,"book":{"id":2323,"title":"Eight Million Ways to Die (Matthew Scudder #5)","description":"Storyline: \n Eight Million Ways to Die (Matthew Scudder #5) \n Nobody knows better than Matthew Scudder how far down a person can sink in this city.
