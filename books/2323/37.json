{"id":62981,"no":37,"title":"Page 37","content":"I had the gun pointed at him. I was prone, elbows braced in front of me, holding the gun in both hands. I had my finger on the trigger.\\n\\n The man leaning out the window threw something, tossed it underhand. I thought, Jesus, a bomb, and I aimed at him and felt the trigger beneath my finger, felt it tremble like some little live thing, and I froze, I froze, I couldn\u0027t pull the fucking trigger.\\n\\n Time froze, too, like a stop-frame sequence in a film. Eight or ten yards from me a bottle struck the brick wall of a building and smashed. There was no explosion beyond the shattering of the glass. It was just an empty bottle.\\n\\n And the car was just a car. I watched now as it went on careening south on Ninth Avenue, six kids in it, six drunken kids, and they might well kill somebody, they were drunk enough to do it, but when they did it would be an accident. They weren\u0027t professional killers, hitmen dispatched to murder me. They were just a bunch of kids who\u0027d had more to drink than they could handle. Maybe they\u0027d cripple someone, maybe they\u0027d total their car, maybe they\u0027d make it home without bending a fender.\\n\\n I got up slowly, looked at the gun in my hand. Thank God I hadn\u0027t fired it. I could have shot them, I could have killed them.\\n\\n God knows I\u0027d wanted to. I\u0027d tried to, thinking logically enough that they were trying to kill me.\\n\\n But I\u0027d been unable to do it. And if it had been pros, if the object I\u0027d seen had been not a whiskey bottle but the gun or bomb I\u0027d thought it was, I\u0027d have been no more able to pull the trigger. They\u0027d have killed me and I\u0027d have died with an unfired revolver in my hands.\\n\\n Jesus.\\n\\n I dropped the useless gun in my pocket. I held out my hand, surprised that it wasn\u0027t shaking. I didn\u0027t even feel particularly shaky inside, and I was damned if I could figure out why not.\\n\\n I went over to examine the broken bottle, if only to make sure it was just that and not a Molotov cocktail that had providentially failed to ignite. But there was no puddle, no reek of gasoline. There was a slight whiskey smell, unless I imagined it, and a label attached to one chunk of glass indicated that the bottle had contained J \u0026 B Scotch. Other fragments of green glass sparkled like jewels in the light of the streetlamp.\\n\\n I bent over and picked up a little cube of glass. I placed it in the palm of my hand and stared at it like a gypsy at a crystal. I thought of Donna\u0027s poem and Sunny\u0027s note and my own slip of the tongue.\\n\\n I started walking. It was all I could do to keep from running.\\n\\n Chapter 27\\n\\n \"Jesus, I need a shave,\" Durkin said. He\u0027d just dropped what was left of his cigarette into what was left of his coffee, and he was running one hand over his cheek, feeling the stubble. \"I need a shave, I need a shower, I need a drink. Not necessarily in that order. I put out an APB on your little Colombian friend. Octavio Ignacio Calderуn y La Barra. Name\u0027s longer\u0027n he is. I checked the morgue. They haven\u0027t got him down there in a drawer. Not yet, anyway.\"\\n\\n He opened his top desk drawer, withdrew a metal shaving mirror and a cordless electric shaver. He leaned the mirror against his empty coffee cup, positioned his face in front of it and began shaving. Over the whirr of the shaver he said, \"I don\u0027t see anything in her file about a ring.\"\\n\\n \"Mind if I look?\"\\n\\n \"Be my guest.\"\\n\\n I studied the inventory sheet, knowing the ring wouldn\u0027t be on it. Then I went over the photographs of the death scene. I tried to look only at her hands. I looked at every picture, and in none of them could I spot anything that suggested she was wearing a ring.\\n\\n I said as much to Durkin. He switched off the shaver, reached for the photographs, went through them carefully and deliberately. \"It\u0027s hard to see her hands in some of these,\" he complained. \"All right, there\u0027s definitely no ring on that hand. What\u0027s that, the left hand? No ring on the left hand. Now in this shot, okay, definitely no ring on that hand. Wait a minute. Shit, that\u0027s the left hand again. It\u0027s not clear in this one. Okay, here we go. That\u0027s definitely her right hand and there\u0027s no ring on it.\" He gathered the photos together like cards to be shuffled and dealt. \"No ring,\" he said. \"What\u0027s that prove?\"\\n\\n \"She had a ring when I saw her. Both times I saw her.\"\\n\\n \"And?\"\\n\\n \"And it disappeared. It\u0027s not at her apartment. There\u0027s a ring in her jewelry box, a high school class ring, but that\u0027s not what I remember seeing on her hand.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe your memory\u0027s false.\"\\n\\n I shook my head. \"The class ring doesn\u0027t even have a stone. I went over there before I came here, just to check my memory. It\u0027s one of those klutzy school rings with too much lettering on it. It\u0027s not what she was wearing. She wouldn\u0027t have worn it, not with this mink and the wine-colored nails.\"\\n\\n I wasn\u0027t the only one who\u0027d said so. After my little epiphany with the bit of broken glass, I\u0027d gone straight to Kim\u0027s apartment, then used her phone to call Donna Campion. \"It\u0027s Matt Scudder,\" I said. \"I know it\u0027s late, but I wanted to ask you about a line in your poem.\"\\n\\n She\u0027d said, \"What line? What poem?\"\\n\\n \"Your poem about Kim. You gave me a copy.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, yes. Just give me a moment, will you? I\u0027m not completely awake.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry to call so late, but-\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s all right. What was the line?\"\\n\\n \"Shatter / Wine bottles at her feet, let green glass / Sparkle upon her hand.\"\\n\\n \"Sparkle\u0027s wrong.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got the poem right here, it says-\"\\n\\n \"Oh, I know that\u0027s what I wrote,\" she said, \"but it\u0027s wrong. I\u0027ll have to change it. I think. What about the line?\"\\n\\n \"Where did you get the green glass from?\"\\n\\n \"From the shattered wine bottles.\"\\n\\n \"Why green glass on her hand? What\u0027s it a reference to?\"\\n\\n \"Oh,\" she said. \"Oh, I see what you mean. Her ring.\"\\n\\n \"She had a ring with a green stone, didn\u0027t she?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right.\"\\n\\n \"How long did she have it?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know.\" She thought it over. \"The first time I saw it was just before I wrote the poem.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re sure of that?\"\\n\\n \"At least that\u0027s the first time I noticed it. It gave me a handle on the poem, as a matter of fact. The contrast of the blue of her eyes and the green of the ring, but then I lost the blue when I got working on the poem.\"\\n\\n She\u0027d told me something along those lines when she first showed me the poem. I hadn\u0027t known then what she was talking about.\\n\\n She wasn\u0027t sure when that might have been. How long had she been working on one or another version of the poem? Since a month before Kim\u0027s murder? Two months?\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" she said. \"I have trouble placing events in time. I don\u0027t tend to keep track.\"\\n\\n \"But it was a ring with a green stone.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, yes. I can picture it now.\"\\n\\n \"Do you know where she got it? Who gave it to her?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know anything about it,\" she said. \"Maybe-\"\\n\\n \"Yes?\"\\n\\n \"Maybe she shattered a wine bottle.\"\\n\\n To Durkin I said, \"A friend of Kim\u0027s wrote a poem and mentioned the ring. And there\u0027s Sunny Hendryx\u0027s suicide note.\" I got out my notebook, flipped it open. I read, \" \u0027There\u0027s no way off the merry-go-round. She grabbed the brass ring and it turned her finger green. Nobody\u0027s going to buy me emeralds.\u0027 \"\\n\\n He took the book from me. \"She meaning Dakkinen, I suppose,\" he said. \"There\u0027s more here. \u0027Nobody\u0027s going to give me babies. Nobody\u0027s going to save my life.\u0027 Dakkinen wasn\u0027t pregnant and neither was Hendryx, so what\u0027s this shit about babies? And neither one of them had her life saved.\" He closed the book with a snap, handed it across the desk to me. \"I don\u0027t know where you can go with this,\" he said. \"It doesn\u0027t look to me like something you can take to the bank. Who knows when Hendryx wrote this? Maybe after the booze and the pills started working, and who can say where she was coming from?\"\\n\\n Behind us, two men in plainclothes were putting a young white kid in the holding cage. A desk away, a sullen black woman was answering questions. I picked up the top photo on the stack and looked at Kim Dakkinen\u0027s butchered body. Durkin switched on the razor and finished shaving.\\n\\n \"What I don\u0027t understand,\" he said, \"is what you think you got. You think she had a boyfriend and the boyfriend gave her the ring. Okay. You also figured she had a boyfriend and he gave her the fur jacket, and you traced that and it looks as though you were right, but the jacket won\u0027t lead to the boyfriend because he kept his name out of it. If you can\u0027t trace him with a jacket that we\u0027ve got, how can you trace him with a ring that all we know about it is it\u0027s missing? You see what I mean?\"\\n\\n \"I see what you mean.\"\\n\\n \"That Sherlock Holmes thing, the dog that didn\u0027t bark, well what you got is a ring that isn\u0027t there, and what does it prove?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s gone.\"\\n\\n \"Right.\"\\n\\n \"Where\u0027d it go?\"\\n\\n \"Same place a bathtub ring goes. Down the fucking drain. How do I know where it went?\"\\n\\n \"It disappeared.\"\\n\\n \"So? Either it walked away or someone took it.\"\\n\\n \"Who?\"\\n\\n \"How do I know who?\"\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s say she wore it to the hotel where she was killed.\"\\n\\n \"You can\u0027t know that.\"\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s just say so, all right?\"\\n\\n \"Okay, run with it.\"\\n\\n \"Who took it? Some cop yank it off her finger?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" he said. \"Nobody\u0027d do that. There\u0027s people who\u0027ll take cash if it\u0027s loose, we both know that, but a ring off a murder victim\u0027s finger?\" He shook his head. \"Besides, nobody was alone with her. It\u0027s something nobody\u0027d do with somebody else watching.\"\\n\\n \"How about the maid? The one who discovered the body?\"\\n\\n \"Jesus, no way. I questioned the poor woman. She took one look at the body and started screaming and she\u0027d still be screaming now if she had the breath left. You couldn\u0027ta got her close enough to Dakkinen to touch her with a mop handle.\"\\n\\n \"Who took the ring?\"\\n\\n \"Assuming she wore it there-\"\\n\\n \"Right.\"\\n\\n \"So the killer took it.\"\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"Maybe he\u0027s queer for jewelry. Maybe green\u0027s his favorite color.\"\\n\\n \"Keep going.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe it\u0027s valuable. You got a guy who goes around killing people, his morals aren\u0027t the best. He might not draw the line at stealing.\"\\n\\n \"He left a few hundred dollars in her purse, Joe.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe he didn\u0027t have time to go through her bag.\"\\n\\n \"He had time to take a shower, for Christ\u0027s sake. He had time to go through her bag. In fact, we don\u0027t know that he didn\u0027t go through her bag. We just know he didn\u0027t take the money.\"\\n\\n \"So?\"\\n\\n \"But he took the ring. He had time to take hold of her bloody hand and tug it off her finger.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe it came off easy. Maybe it wasn\u0027t a snug fit.\"\\n\\n \"Why\u0027d he take it?\"\\n\\n \"He wanted it for his sister.\"\\n\\n \"Got any better reasons?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" he said. \"No, goddamn it, I don\u0027t have any better reasons. What are you getting at? He took it because it could be traced to him?\"\\n\\n \"Why not?\"\\n\\n \"Then why didn\u0027t he take the fur? We fucking know a boyfriend bought her the fur. Maybe he didn\u0027t use his name, but how can he be sure of what he let slip and what the salesman remembers? He took towels, for Christ\u0027s sake, so he wouldn\u0027t leave a fucking pubic hair behind, but he left the fur. And now you say he took the ring. Where did this ring come from besides left field? Why have I got to hear about this ring tonight when I never heard of it once in the past two and a half weeks?\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/eight-million-ways-to-die-matthew-scudder-5/page-37.html","bookId":2323,"book":{"id":2323,"title":"Eight Million Ways to Die (Matthew Scudder #5)","description":"Storyline: Eight Million Ways to Die (Matthew Scudder #5) \\n Nobody knows better than Matthew Scudder how far down a person can sink in this city.
