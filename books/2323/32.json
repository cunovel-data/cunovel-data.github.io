I don\u0027t need a whole lot of sleep, but I got what I needed.\" \"Uh-huh.\" \"And I was just there, you know?\" He walked over to the wall, took a staring mask from the nail where it hung. He started telling me about it, the tribe, their geographical location, the purpose of the mask. I didn\u0027t pay much attention. \"Now I got fingerprints on it,\" he said. \"Well, that\u0027s okay. You can tell \u0027em while we were waiting for them I took the mask off the wall and told you its history. I might as well tell the truth. Wouldn\u0027t want to get caught in some nasty old little white lie.\" He smiled at the last phrase. \"Little black lie,\" he said. \"Whyn\u0027t you make that call?\" Chapter 23 It wasn\u0027t half the hassle it might have been. I didn\u0027t know either of the cops who came out from the Twentieth, but it couldn\u0027t have gone much smoother if I had. We answered questions on the scene and went back to the station house on West Eighty-second to give our statements. The on-scene medical evidence all seemed to be consistent with what we\u0027d reported. The cops were quick to point out that Chance should have called in as soon as he found the dead girl, but they didn\u0027t really jump on him for taking his time. Walking in on an unexpected corpse is a shock, even if you\u0027re a pimp and she\u0027s a whore, and this, after all, was New York, the city of the uninvolved, and what was remarkable was not that he\u0027d called it in late but that he\u0027d called it in at all. I was at ease by the time we got to the station house. I\u0027d only been anxious early on when it occurred to me that it might occur to them to frisk us. My coat was a small-time arsenal, still holding the gun and the two knives I\u0027d taken from the kid in the alley. The knives were both illegal weapons. The gun was that and possibly more; God only knew what kind of a provenance it had. But we\u0027d done nothing to rate a frisk, and, happily, we didn\u0027t get one. \"Whores\u0027ll kill themselves,\" Joe Durkin said. \"It\u0027s something they do, and this one had a history. You saw the wrist scars? Those were a few years old, according to the report. What you might not know is she tried the pill route a little less than a year ago. A girlfriend took her over to St. Clare\u0027s to get her stomach pumped.\" \"There was something in the note. She hoped she had enough this time, something like that.\" \"Well, she got her wish.\" We were at the Slate, a Tenth Avenue steak house that draws a lot of cops from John Jay College and Midtown North. I\u0027d been back at my hotel, changing my clothes, finding places to stow the weapons and some of the money I\u0027d been carrying, when he called to suggest I buy him a dinner. \"I thought I\u0027d hit you up for a meal now,\" he said, \"before all your client\u0027s girls are dead and your expense account gets trimmed.\" He had the mixed grill and drank a couple of Carlsbergs with it. I ordered the chopped sirloin and drank black coffee with my meal. We talked a little about Sunny\u0027s suicide but it didn\u0027t carry us very far. He said, \"If it wasn\u0027t for the other one, the blonde, you wouldn\u0027t even think to look at it twice. All the medical evidence fits in with suicide. The bruises, that\u0027s easy. She was groggy, she didn\u0027t know what she was doing, she fell and bumped into things. Same reason she was on the floor instead of the bed. There was nothing special about the bruises. Her prints were where they belonged- the bottle, the glass, the pill bottles. The note matches other samples of her handwriting. If we buy your guy\u0027s story, she was even in a locked room when he found her. Locked from inside, the chain on. You figure that for the truth?\" \"His whole story sounded true to me.\" \"So she killed herself. It even fits with the Dakkinen death two weeks ago. They were friends and she was depressed by what happened to her friend. You see any way it was anything but suicide?\" I shook my head. \"It\u0027s the hardest kind of suicide to stage. What do you do, stuff the pills down her throat with a funnel? Make her take them at gunpoint?\" \"You can dissolve the contents, let her take them without knowing it. But they found traces of the Seconal capsules in the stomach contents. So forget that. It\u0027s suicide.\" I tried to remember the annual suicide rate in the city. I couldn\u0027t even come up with an educated guess, and Durkin was no help. I wondered what the rate was, and if it was on the rise like everything else. Over coffee he said, \"I had a couple of clerks go through the registration cards at the Galaxy Downtowner since the first of the year. Pulling the block-printed ones. Nothing ties into the Jones registration.\" \"And the other hotels?\" \"Nothing that fits. A batch of people called Jones, it\u0027s a common enough name, but they\u0027re all signatures and credit cards and they look bona fide. Waste of time.\" \"Sorry.\" \"Why? Ninety percent of what I do is a waste of time. You were right, it was worth checking. If this had been a big case, front-page stuff, top brass putting pressure on, you can believe I\u0027d have thought of it myself and we\u0027d be checking every hotel in the five boroughs. How about you?\" \"What about me?\" \"You getting anywhere with Dakkinen?\" I had to think. \"No,\" I said, finally. \"It\u0027s aggravating. I went over the file again and you know what got stuck in my throat? That desk clerk.\" \"The one I talked to?\" \"That was a manager, assistant manager, something like that. No, the one who checked the killer in. Now here\u0027s a guy comes in, prints his name instead of writing it, and pays cash. Those are two unusual things for a person to do, right? I mean, who pays cash in front for a hotel nowadays? I don\u0027t mean in a hot-pillow joint, I mean a decent hotel where you\u0027re going to spend sixty or eighty dollars for a room. Everything\u0027s plastic nowadays, credit cards, that\u0027s the whole business. But this guy paid cash and the desk clerk doesn\u0027t remember shit about him.\" \"Did you check him out?\" He nodded. \"I went and talked to him last night. Well, he\u0027s this South American kid, up from one of those countries. He was in a fog when I talked to him. He was probably in a fog when the killer checked in. He probably lives his life in a fog. I don\u0027t know where his fog comes from, whether he smokes it or snorts it or what he does, but I think he probably comes by it honestly. You know the percentage of this city that\u0027s stoned all the time?\" \"I know what you mean.\" \"You see \u0027em at lunch hour. Office workers, midtown, Wall Street, I don\u0027t care what neighborhood you\u0027re talking about. They buy the fucking joints in the street and spend their lunch hour smoking \u0027em in the park. How does anybody get any work done?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"And there\u0027s all these pillheads. Like this woman who killed herself. Taking all those pills all the time, and she wasn\u0027t even breaking the law. Drugs.\" He sighed, shook his head, smoothed his dark hair. \"Well, what I\u0027m gonna have is a brandy,\" he said, \"if you think your client can afford it.\" I got over to St. Paul\u0027s in time for the last ten minutes of the meeting. I had coffee and a cookie and barely listened to what was being said. I didn\u0027t even have to say my name, and I ducked out during the prayer. I went back to the hotel. There were no messages. I\u0027d had a couple of calls, the desk man told me, but nobody\u0027d left a name. I went upstairs and tried to sort out how I felt about Sunny\u0027s suicide, but all I seemed to feel so far was numb. It was tempting to beat myself up with the thought that I might have learned something if I hadn\u0027t saved her interrogation for last, might even have said or done something to forestall her suicide, but I couldn\u0027t get much mileage out of that one. I\u0027d talked to her on the phone. She could have said something and she hadn\u0027t. And suicide, after all, was something she\u0027d tried at least twice in the past, and very likely a time or two of which there\u0027d been no record. Try something long enough, sooner or later you get it right. In the morning I had a light breakfast and went over to the bank, where I deposited some cash and bought a money order. I went to the post office and mailed it to Anita. I hadn\u0027t given a whole lot of thought to my son\u0027s orthodontia and now I could forget it altogether. I walked on to St. Paul\u0027s and lit a candle for Sonya Hendryx. I sat in a pew, giving myself a few minutes to remember Sunny. There wasn\u0027t much to remember. We\u0027d barely met. I couldn\u0027t even recall very clearly what she looked like because her image in death pushed my dim memory of the living Sunny to the side. It occurred to me that I owed the church money. Ten percent of Chance\u0027s fee came to $250, and they were further entitled to a tithe of the three hundred bucks and change I\u0027d taken off the kid who\u0027d tried mugging me. I didn\u0027t have an exact count but $350 struck me as a fair estimate, so I could give them $285 and call it even. But I\u0027d put most of my money in the bank. I had a few hundred dollars in my wallet but if I gave the church $285 I\u0027d be strapped for walk-around money. I weighed the nuisance of another trip to the bank, and then the fundamental insanity of my little game struck me like a kidney punch. What was I doing anyway? Why did I figure I owed anybody money? And who did I owe it to? Not the church, I didn\u0027t belong to any church. I gave my tithes to whatever house of worship came along at the right time. To whom, then, was I in debt? To God? Where was the sense in that? And what was the nature of this debt? How did I owe it? Was I repaying borrowed funds? Or had I invented some sort of bribe scheme, some celestial protection racket? I\u0027d never had trouble rationalizing it before. It was just a custom, a minor eccentricity. I didn\u0027t file a tax return so I paid a tithe instead. I\u0027d never really let myself ask myself why. I wasn\u0027t sure I liked the answer. I remembered, too, a thought that had crossed my mind momentarily in that alley off St. Nicholas Avenue- that I was going to get killed by this boy because I hadn\u0027t paid my tithe. Not that I\u0027d really believed it, not that I thought the world worked that way, but how remarkable that I\u0027d had such a thought at all. After awhile I took out my wallet, counted out the $285. I sat there with the money in my hand. Then I put it all back in my wallet, all but a dollar. At least I could pay for the candle. That afternoon I walked all the way to Kim\u0027s building. The weather wasn\u0027t bad and I didn\u0027t have anything better to do. I walked past the doorman and let myself into her apartment. The first thing I did was pour the bottle of Wild Turkey down the sink. I don\u0027t know how much sense that made. There was plenty of other booze there and I didn\u0027t feel like doing my Carrie Nation imitation. But the Wild Turkey had taken on the status of a symbol. I pictured the bottle every time I thought of going to that apartment, and the picture was accompanied more often than not by a vivid memory of the taste and smell. When the last of it went down the sink I was able to relax. Then I went back to the front closet and checked out the fur coat hanging there. A label sewn to the lining identified the garment as consisting of dyed lapin. I used the Yellow Pages, called a furrier at random and learned that lapin was the French word for \"rabbit.\" \"You could find it in a dictionary,\" I was told. \"A regular American dictionary. It\u0027s an English word now, it came into the language from the fur business. Plain old rabbit.\" Just as Chance had said. On the way home something triggered the thought of having a beer. I don\u0027t even recall what the stimulus was, but the response was a picture of myself with a shoulder pressed against a bar and one foot up on the brass rail, bell-shaped glass in hand, sawdust on the floor, my nostrils full of the smell of a musty old tavern.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/eight-million-ways-to-die-matthew-scudder-5/page-32.html","bookId":2323,"book":{"id":2323,"title":"Eight Million Ways to Die (Matthew Scudder #5)","description":"Storyline: Eight Million Ways to Die (Matthew Scudder #5) Nobody knows better than Matthew Scudder how far down a person can sink in this city.
