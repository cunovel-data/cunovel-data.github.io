Making that phone call.\" \"Oh, well,\" he said. \"No, that was terrific,\" I said. \"I really appreciate it.\" I went upstairs and got ready for bed. I was tired and felt out of breath. For a moment, just before sleep came, I experienced again that odd sensation of having lost something. But what could I have lost? I thought, Seven days. You had seven sober days and most of an eighth, and you lost them. They\u0027re gone. Chapter 8 I bought the News the next morning. A new atrocity had already driven Kim Dakkinen off the front page. Up in Washington Heights a young surgeon, a resident at Columbia Presbyterian, had been shot dead in a robbery attempt on Riverside Drive. He hadn\u0027t resisted his assailant, who had shot him for no apparent reason. The victim\u0027s widow was expecting their first child in early February. The call-girl slashing was on an inside page. I didn\u0027t learn anything I hadn\u0027t heard the previous night from Durkin. I walked around a lot. At noon I dropped over to the Y but got restless and left during the qualification. I had a pastrami sandwich at a Broadway deli and drank a bottle of Prior Dark with it. I had another beer around dinnertime. At eight-thirty I went over to St. Paul\u0027s, walked once around the block and returned to my hotel without entering the basement meeting room. I made myself stay in my room. I felt like a drink, but I\u0027d had two beers and I decided that two drinks a day would be my ration. As long as I didn\u0027t exceed that quota I didn\u0027t see how I could get in trouble. It didn\u0027t matter whether I had them first thing in the morning or last thing at night, in my room or at a bar, alone or in company. The following day, Wednesday, I slept late and ate a late breakfast at Armstrong\u0027s. I walked to the main library and spent a couple hours there, then sat in Bryant Park until the drug dealers got on my nerves. They\u0027ve so completely taken over the parks that they assume only a potential customer would bother coming there, so you can\u0027t read a paper without being constantly offered uppers and downers and pot and acid and God knows what else. I went to the eight-thirty meeting that night. Mildred, one of the regulars, got a round of applause when she announced that it was her anniversary, eleven years since her last drink. She said she didn\u0027t have any secret, she just did it a day at a time. I thought that if I went to bed sober I\u0027d have one day. I decided, what the hell, I\u0027d do that. After the meeting I went over to Polly\u0027s Cage instead and had my two drinks. I got into a discussion with a guy and he wanted to buy me a third drink, but I told the bartender to make it Coke instead. I was quietly pleased with myself, knowing my limit and sticking to it. Thursday I had a beer with dinner, went to the meeting and left on the break. I stopped in at Armstrong\u0027s but something kept me from ordering a drink there and I didn\u0027t stay long. I was restless, I walked in and out of Farrell\u0027s and Polly\u0027s without ordering a drink in either place. The liquor store down the block from Polly\u0027s was still open. I bought a fifth of J. W. Dant and took it back to my room. I took a shower first and got ready for bed. Then I broke the seal on the bottle, poured about two ounces of bourbon in a water glass, drank it down and went to sleep. Friday I had another two ounces first thing when I got out of bed. I really felt the drink and it was a good feeling. I went all day without having another. Then around bedtime I had one more and fell asleep. Saturday I awoke clearheaded with no desire for a morning drink. I couldn\u0027t get over how well I was controlling my drinking. I almost felt like going to a meeting and sharing my secret with them, but I could imagine the reaction I\u0027d get. Knowing looks, knowing laughter. Holier-than-thou sobriety. Besides, just because I could control my drinking didn\u0027t mean I was justified in recommending it to other people. I had two drinks before bed. I barely felt them, but Sunday morning I woke up a little rocky and poured myself a generous eye-opener to start the day. It did the job. I read the paper, then checked the meeting book and found an afternoon meeting in the Village. I went down there on the subway. The crowd was almost entirely gay. I left at the break. I went back to the hotel and took a nap. After dinner I finished reading the paper and decided to have my second drink. I poured two or three ounces of bourbon into my glass and drank it off. I sat down and read some more but I couldn\u0027t concentrate very well on what I was reading. I thought of having another drink but I reminded myself I\u0027d already had two that day. Then I realized something. I\u0027d had my morning drink more than twelve hours ago. More time had elapsed since then than had separated it from my last drink the night before. So that drink had long since left my system, and shouldn\u0027t properly be counted as part of today\u0027s drinks. Which meant I was entitled to another drink before I went to bed. I was pleased with having figured that out, and decided to reward myself for my insight by making the drink a respectable one. I filled the water glass to within a half inch of the top and took my time drinking it, sitting in my chair with it like a model in one of those Man of Distinction ads. I had the sense to realize that it was the number of drinks that was significant, not their size, and then it struck me that I\u0027d cheated myself. My first drink, if you could call it that, had been a short measure. In a sense, I owed myself about four ounces of bourbon. I poured what I judged to be four ounces and drained the glass. I was pleased to note that the drinks hadn\u0027t had any discernible effect on me. I certainly wasn\u0027t drunk. As a matter of fact, I felt better than I\u0027d felt in a long time. Too good, in fact, to sit around the room. I\u0027d go out, find a congenial spot, have a Coke or a cup of coffee. Not a drink, because in the first place I didn\u0027t want any more and, just as important, I\u0027d already had my two drinks for the day. I had a Coke at Polly\u0027s. On Ninth Avenue I had a glass of ginger ale at a gay bar called Kid Gloves. Some of the other drinkers looked faintly familiar, and I wondered if any of them had been at the meeting that afternoon in the Village. A block further downtown I realized something. I\u0027d been controlling my drinking for days now, and before that I\u0027d been off the sauce entirely for over a week, and that proved something. Hell, if I could limit myself to two drinks a day, that was fairly strong evidence that I didn\u0027t need to limit myself to two drinks a day. I\u0027d had my problems with alcohol in the past, I couldn\u0027t very well deny it, but evidently I had outgrown that stage in my life. So, although I certainly didn\u0027t need another drink, I could just as certainly have one if I wanted one. And I did want one, as a matter of fact, so why not have it? I went into the saloon and ordered a double bourbon with water back. I remember the bartender had a shiny bald head, and I remember him pouring the drink, and I remember picking it up. That\u0027s the last thing I remember. Chapter 9 I woke up suddenly, consciousness coming on abruptly and at top volume. I was in a hospital bed. That was the first shock. The second came a little later when I found out it was Wednesday. I couldn\u0027t remember anything after I picked up that third drink Sunday night. I\u0027d had occasional blackouts for years. Sometimes I\u0027d lose the last half hour of the night. Sometimes I\u0027d lose a few hours. I\u0027d never lost two whole days before. They didn\u0027t want to let me go. I\u0027d been admitted late the previous night and they wanted to keep me in detox for a full five days. An intern said, \"The booze isn\u0027t even out of your system yet. You\u0027ll walk around the corner and pick up a drink five minutes after you get out of here.\" \"No I won\u0027t.\" \"You just went through detox here a couple of weeks ago. It\u0027s on your chart. We cleaned you up and how long did you last?\" I didn\u0027t say anything. \"You know how you got here last night? You had a convulsion, a full-scale grand mal seizure. Ever have one of those before?\" \"No.\" \"Well, you\u0027ll have them again. If you keep on drinking you can pretty much count on it. Not every time, but sooner or later. And sooner or later you\u0027ll die of it. If you don\u0027t die of something else first.\" \"Stop it.\" He grabbed me by the shoulder. \"No, I won\u0027t stop it,\" he said. \"Why the hell should I stop it? I can\u0027t be polite and considerate of your feelings and expect to cut through all your bullshit at the same time. Look at me. Listen to me. You\u0027re an alcoholic. If you drink you\u0027ll die.\" I didn\u0027t say anything. He had it all figured out. I would spend ten days in detox. Then I\u0027d go to Smithers for twenty-eight days of alcoholic rehabilitation. He let up on that part when he found out I didn\u0027t have medical insurance or the couple of thousand dollars rehab would cost, but he was still holding out for a five-day stay in the detox ward. \"I don\u0027t have to stay,\" I said. \"I\u0027m not going to drink.\" \"Everybody says that.\" \"In my case it\u0027s true. And you can\u0027t keep me here if I don\u0027t agree to stay. You have to let me sign out.\" \"If you do you\u0027ll be signing out AMA. Against Medical Advice.\" \"Than that\u0027s what I\u0027ll do.\" He looked angry for a moment. Then he shrugged. \"Suit yourself,\" he said cheerfully. \"Next time maybe you\u0027ll listen to advice.\" \"There won\u0027t be a next time.\" \"Oh, there\u0027ll be a next time, all right,\" he said. \"Unless you fall on your face closer to some other hospital. Or die before you get here.\" The clothes they brought me were a mess, dirty from rolling in the street, the shirt and jacket stained with blood. I\u0027d been bleeding from a scalp wound when they brought me in and they\u0027d stitched it up for me. I had evidently sustained the wound during the seizure, unless I\u0027d acquired it earlier in my adventures. I had enough cash on me for the hospital bill. A minor miracle, that. It had rained during the morning and the streets were still wet. I stood on the sidewalk and felt the confidence drain out of me. There was a bar right across the street. I had money in my pocket for a drink and I knew it would make me feel better. I went back to my hotel instead. I had to get up the nerve to approach the desk and collect my mail and messages, as if I\u0027d done something shameful and owed some profound apology to the desk clerk. The worst of it was not knowing what I might have done during the time I was in blackout. Nothing showed in the clerk\u0027s expression. Maybe I\u0027d spent most of the lost time in my room, drinking in isolation. Maybe I\u0027d never returned to the hotel since I left it Sunday night. I went upstairs and ruled out the latter hypothesis. I\u0027d evidently returned sometime either Monday or Tuesday, because I\u0027d finished the bottle of J. W. Dant and there was a half-full quart of Jim Beam on the bureau beside the empty Dant bottle. The dealer\u0027s label indicated it was from a store on Eighth Avenue. I thought, Well, here\u0027s the first test. Either you drink or you don\u0027t. I poured the bourbon down the sink, rinsed out both bottles and put them in the trash. The mail was all junk. I got rid of it and looked at my messages. Anita had called Monday morning. Someone named Jim Faber had called Tuesday night and left a number. And Chance had called once last night and once this morning. I took a long hot shower and a careful shave and put on clean clothes. I threw out the shirt and socks and underwear I\u0027d worn home from the hospital and put the suit aside. Maybe the dry cleaner would be able to do something with it. I picked up my messages and went through them again.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/eight-million-ways-to-die-matthew-scudder-5/page-11.html","bookId":2323,"book":{"id":2323,"title":"Eight Million Ways to Die (Matthew Scudder #5)","description":"Storyline: Eight Million Ways to Die (Matthew Scudder #5) Nobody knows better than Matthew Scudder how far down a person can sink in this city.
