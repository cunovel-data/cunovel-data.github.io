Like with a shrink, I suppose. You took my money and now you have to listen.\"\\n\\n \"All part of the service. How did you decide to be a pimp?\"\\n\\n \"How did a nice boy like me get into a business like this?\" He chuckled, then stopped and thought for a moment. \"I had this friend,\" he said. \"A white boy from Oak Park, Illinois. That\u0027s outside of Chicago.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve heard of it.\"\\n\\n \"I had this act for him, that I was from the ghetto, that I\u0027d done it all, you know? Then he got killed. It was stupid, we weren\u0027t near the line, he got drunk and a jeep ran over him. But he was dead and I wasn\u0027t telling those stories anymore, and my mama was dead and I knew when I got home I wasn\u0027t going back to college.\"\\n\\n He walked over to the window. \"And I had this girl over there,\" he said, his back to me. \"Little bit of a thing, and I\u0027d go over to her place and smoke skag and lay around. I\u0027d give her money, and, you know, I found out she was taking my money and giving it to her boyfriend, and here I was having fantasies of marrying this woman, bringing her back Stateside. I wouldn\u0027t have done it, but I was thinking about it, and then I found out she wasn\u0027t but a whore. I don\u0027t know why I ever thought she was anything else, but a man\u0027ll do that, you know.\\n\\n \"I thought about killing her, but shit, I didn\u0027t want to do that. I wasn\u0027t even that angry. What I did, I stopped smoking, I stopped drinking, I stopped all kinds of getting high.\"\\n\\n \"Just like that?\"\\n\\n \"Just like that. And I asked myself, Okay, what do you want to be? And the picture filled in, you know, a few lines here and a few lines there. I was a good little soldier for the rest of my hitch. Then I came back and went into business.\"\\n\\n \"You just taught yourself?\"\\n\\n \"Shit, I invented myself. Gave myself the name Chance. I started out in life with a first name and a middle name and a last name, and wasn\u0027t any of them Chance. I gave myself a name and created a style and the rest just fell into place. Pimping\u0027s easy to learn. The whole thing is power. You just act like you already got it and the women come and give it to you. That\u0027s all it really is.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you have to have a purple hat?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s probably easiest if you look and dress the part. But if you go and play against the stereotype they think you\u0027re something special.\"\\n\\n \"Were you?\"\\n\\n \"I was always fair with them. Never knocked them around, never threatened them. Kim wanted to quit me and what did I do? Told her to go ahead and God bless.\"\\n\\n \"The pimp with the heart of gold.\"\\n\\n \"You think you\u0027re joking. But I cared for them. And I had a heavenly dream for a life, man. I really did.\"\\n\\n \"You still do.\"\\n\\n He shook his head. \"No,\" he said. \"It\u0027s slipping away. Whole thing\u0027s slipping away and I can\u0027t hold onto it.\"\\n\\n Chapter 31\\n\\n We left the converted firehouse with me in the back seat and Chance wearing a chauffeur\u0027s cap. A few blocks away he pulled over and returned the cap to the glove compartment while I joined him in front. The commuter traffic had pretty much thinned out by then and we made the trip into Manhattan quickly and in relative silence. We were a little aloof with each other, as if we\u0027d already shared more than either of us had anticipated.\\n\\n No messages at the desk. I went upstairs, changed my clothes, paused on the way out the door and got the.32 from my dresser drawer. Was there any point in carrying a gun I seemed unable to fire? I couldn\u0027t see any, but I put it in my pocket anyway.\\n\\n I went downstairs and bought a paper, and without thinking too much about it I walked around the corner and took a table in Armstrong\u0027s. My usual corner table. Trina came over, said it had been a long time, and took my order for a cheeseburger and a small salad and coffee.\\n\\n After she headed for the kitchen I got a sudden flash of a martini, straight up and bone dry and ice cold in a stemmed glass. I could see it, I could smell the odor of juniper and the tang of a lemon twist. I could feel the bite as it hit bottom.\\n\\n Jesus, I thought.\\n\\n The urge for a drink passed as suddenly as it had come on me. I decided it was a reflex, a reaction to the atmosphere of Armstrong\u0027s. I\u0027d done so much drinking here for so long, I\u0027d been eighty-sixed here after my last bender, and I hadn\u0027t crossed the threshold since. It was only natural that I\u0027d think of a drink. It didn\u0027t mean I had to have one.\\n\\n I ate my meal, drank a second cup of coffee afterward. I read my newspaper, paid my check, left a tip. Then it was time to go over to St. Paul\u0027s.\\n\\n The qualification was an alcoholic version of the American Dream. The speaker was a poor boy from Worcester, Mass. who worked his way through college, rose to a vice-presidency at one of the television networks, then lost it all drinking. He went all the way down, wound up in Los Angeles drinking Sterno in Pershing Square, then found AA and got it all back.\\n\\n It would have been inspiring if I could have kept my mind on it. But my attention kept straying. I thought about Sunny\u0027s funeral, I thought about what Chance had told me, and I found my thoughts wandering all over the whole case, trying to make sense out of it.\\n\\n Damnit, it was all there. I just wasn\u0027t looking at it right.\\n\\n I left during the discussion, before it was my turn to speak. I didn\u0027t even feel like saying my name tonight. I walked back to my hotel, fighting the urge to stop in at Armstrong\u0027s for a minute or two.\\n\\n I called Durkin. He was out. I hung up without leaving a message and called Jan.\\n\\n No answer. Well, she was probably still at her meeting. And she\u0027d go out for coffee afterward, probably wouldn\u0027t get home until after eleven.\\n\\n I could have stayed at my own meeting until it ended, then gone to coffee with some of the others. I could join them now, as far as that went. The Cobb\u0027s Corner where they hung out wasn\u0027t all that far away.\\n\\n I thought about it. And decided I didn\u0027t really want to go there.\\n\\n I picked up a book but couldn\u0027t make sense out of it. I tossed it down, got undressed, went into the bathroom and ran the shower. But I didn\u0027t need a shower, for Christ\u0027s sake, I just had a shower that morning, and the most strenuous activity I\u0027d had all day was watching Chance working out with weights. What the hell did I need with a shower?\\n\\n I turned the water off and got dressed again.\\n\\n Jesus, I felt like a caged lion. I picked up the phone. I might have called Chance but you couldn\u0027t just call the son of a bitch, you had to call his service and wait for him to call back, and I didn\u0027t feel like doing that. I called Jan, who was still out, and I called Durkin. He wasn\u0027t there either, and once again I decided against leaving a message.\\n\\n Maybe he was at that place on Tenth Avenue, unwinding with a couple of belts. I thought about going over there and looking for him, and it struck me that it wasn\u0027t Durkin I\u0027d be looking for, that all I wanted was an excuse to walk through the door of that bucket of blood and put my foot upon the brass rail.\\n\\n Did they even have a brass rail? I closed my eyes and tried to picture the place, and in an instant I was recalling everything about it, the smells of spilled booze and stale beer and urine, that dank tavern smell that welcomes you home.\\n\\n I thought, You\u0027ve got nine days and you went to two meetings today, a noon meeting and an evening meeting, and you\u0027ve never been closer to a drink. What the hell\u0027s the matter with you?\\n\\n If I went to Durkin\u0027s boozer I\u0027d drink. If I went to Farrell\u0027s or Polly\u0027s or Armstrong\u0027s I would drink. If I stayed in my room I\u0027d go crazy, and when I went crazy enough I\u0027d get away from those four walls and what would I do? I\u0027d go out, to one bar or another, and I\u0027d drink.\\n\\n I made myself stay there. I\u0027d gotten through the eighth day and there was no reason why I couldn\u0027t get through the ninth. I sat there and every now and then I looked at my watch and sometimes a whole minute went by between looks. Finally it got to be eleven o\u0027clock and I went downstairs and hailed a taxi.\\n\\n There\u0027s a midnight meeting seven nights a week at the Moravian Church on the corner of Thirtieth and Lexington. The doors open about an hour before meeting time. I got there and took a seat, and when the coffee was ready I got myself a cup.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t pay attention to the qualification or the discussion. I just sat there and let myself feel safe. There were a lot of newly sober people in the room, a lot of people who were having a hard time. Why else would they be there at that hour?\\n\\n There were some people who hadn\u0027t stopped drinking yet, too. They had to put one of them out, but the others didn\u0027t make any trouble. Just a roomful of people getting through one more hour.\\n\\n When the hour was up I helped fold the chairs and empty the ashtrays. Another chair folder introduced himself as Kevin and asked me how long I\u0027d been sober. I told him it was my ninth day.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s great,\" he said. \"Keep coming back.\"\\n\\n They always say that.\\n\\n I went outside and signaled a passing cab, but when he cut over and started to brake I changed my mind and waved him off. He gunned his engine as he drove away.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t want to go back to the room.\\n\\n So instead I walked seven blocks north to Kim\u0027s building, bluffed my way past her doorman, let myself into her apartment. I knew there was a closetful of booze there but it didn\u0027t bother me. I didn\u0027t even feel the need to pour it down the sink, as I\u0027d done with the bottle of Wild Turkey earlier.\\n\\n In her bedroom, I went through her jewelry. I wasn\u0027t really looking for the green ring. I picked up the ivory bracelet, unfastened the clasp, tried it for size on my own wrist. It was too small. I got some paper towels from the kitchen and wrapped the bracelet carefully, put it in my pocket.\\n\\n Maybe Jan would like it. I\u0027d pictured it on her wrist a few times- at her loft, during the funeral service.\\n\\n If she didn\u0027t like it she didn\u0027t have to wear it.\\n\\n I went over, picked up the phone. The service hadn\u0027t been disconnected yet. I supposed it would be sooner or later, just as sooner or later the apartment would be cleaned and Kim\u0027s things removed from it. But for now it was still as if she\u0027d just stepped out for a moment.\\n\\n I hung up the phone without calling anyone. Somewhere around three o\u0027clock I got undressed and went to sleep in her bed. I didn\u0027t change the linen, and it seemed to me that her scent, still faintly discernible, constituted a presence in the room.\\n\\n If so, it didn\u0027t keep me awake. I went right off to sleep.\\n\\n I woke up bathed in perspiration, convinced that I\u0027d solved the case in a dream and then forgot the solution. I showered and dressed and got out of there.\\n\\n There were several messages at my hotel, all of them from Mary Lou Barcker. She\u0027d called just after I left the night before and a couple of times that morning.\\n\\n When I called her she said, \"I\u0027ve been trying to reach you. I would have called you at your girlfriend\u0027s but I couldn\u0027t remember her last name.\"\\n\\n \"Her number\u0027s unlisted.\" And I wasn\u0027t there, I thought, but left it unsaid.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m trying to reach Chance,\" she went on. \"I thought you might have talked to him.\"\\n\\n \"Not since around seven last night. Why?\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t get hold of him. The only way I know is to call his service-\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the only way I know.\"\\n\\n \"Oh. I thought you might have a special number.\"\\n\\n \"Only the service.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve called there. He always returns his calls. I\u0027ve left, God, I don\u0027t know how many messages and he hasn\u0027t called me back.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/eight-million-ways-to-die-matthew-scudder-5/page-44.html","bookId":2323,"book":{"id":2323,"title":"Eight Million Ways to Die (Matthew Scudder #5)","description":"Storyline: Eight Million Ways to Die (Matthew Scudder #5) \\n Nobody knows better than Matthew Scudder how far down a person can sink in this city.
