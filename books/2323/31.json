That gets to me, Matt. You read that note?\" The note was on the vanity, anchored with a bottle of Norell cologne. I nudged the bottle aside with the back of my hand and carried the note over to the window. She\u0027d written it in brown ink on beige notepaper and I wanted to read it in decent light. I read: Kim, you were lucky. You found someone to do it for you, I have to do it myself. If I had the guts I would use the window. I could change my mind halfway down and laugh the rest of the way. But I haven\u0027t got the guts and the razor blade didn\u0027t work. I hope I took enough this time. It\u0027s no use. The good times are all used up. Chance, I\u0027m sorry. You showed me good times but they\u0027re gone. The crowds went home in the eighth inning. All the cheering stopped. Nobody\u0027s even keeping score anymore. There\u0027s no way off the merry-go-round. She grabbed the brass ring and it turned her finger green. Nobody\u0027s going to buy me emeralds. Nobody\u0027s going to give me babies. Nobody\u0027s going to save my life. I\u0027m sick of smiling. I\u0027m tired of trying to catch up and catch on. All the good times are gone. I looked out the window across the Hudson at the Jersey skyline. Sunny had lived and died on the thirty-second floor of a high-rise apartment complex called Lincoln View Gardens, though I hadn\u0027t seen any trace of garden beyond the potted palms in the lobby. \"That\u0027s Lincoln Center down there,\" Chance said. I nodded. \"I should have put Mary Lou here. She likes concerts, she could just walk over. Thing is, she used to live on the West Side. So I wanted to move her to the East Side. You want to do that, you know. Make a big change in their lives right away.\" I didn\u0027t much care about the philosophy of pimping. I said, \"She do this before?\" \"Kill herself?\" \"Try to. She wrote \u0027I hope I took enough this time.\u0027 Was there a time she didn\u0027t take enough?\" \"Not since I\u0027ve known her. And that\u0027s a couple years.\" \"What does she mean when she says the razor blade didn\u0027t work?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" I went to her, examined the wrist of the arm stretched out above her head. There was a clearly perceptible horizontal scar. I found an identical scar on her other wrist. I stood up, read the note again. \"What happens now, man?\" I got out my notebook and copied what she\u0027d written word for word. I used a Kleenex to remove what prints I\u0027d left on it, then put it back where I\u0027d found it and anchored it again with the cologne bottle. I said, \"Tell me again what you did last night.\" \"Just what I already told you. I called her and I got a feeling, I don\u0027t know why, and I came here.\" \"What time?\" \"After two. I didn\u0027t notice the exact time.\" \"You came right upstairs?\" \"That\u0027s right.\" \"The doorman see you?\" \"We sort of nodded at each other. He knows me, thinks I live here.\" \"Will he remember you?\" \"Man, I don\u0027t know what he remembers and what he forgets.\" \"He just work weekends or was he on Friday as well?\" \"I don\u0027t know. What\u0027s the difference?\" \"If he\u0027s been on every night he might remember he saw you but not remember when. If he just works Saturdays-\" \"I get you.\" In the small kitchen a bottle of Georgi vodka stood on the sink board with an inch\u0027s depth of liquor left in it. Beside it was an empty cardboard quart of orange juice. A glass in the sink held a residue of what looked like a mixture of the two, and there\u0027d been a faint trace of orange in the reek of her vomit. You didn\u0027t need to be much of a detective to put those pieces together. Pills, washed down with a batch of strong screwdrivers, their sedative effect boosted by the alcohol. I hope I took enough this time. I had to fight the impulse to pour the last of the vodka down the drain. \"How long were you here, Chance?\" \"I don\u0027t know. Didn\u0027t pay attention to the time.\" \"Talk to the doorman on the way out?\" He shook his head. \"I went down to the basement and out through the garage.\" \"So he wouldn\u0027t have seen you.\" \"Nobody saw me.\" \"And while you were here-\" \"Like I said. I looked in the drawers and closets. I didn\u0027t touch many things and I didn\u0027t move anything.\" \"You read the note?\" \"Yeah. But I didn\u0027t pick it up to do it.\" \"Make any phone calls?\" \"My service, to check in. And I called you. But you weren\u0027t there.\" No, I hadn\u0027t been there. I\u0027d been breaking a boy\u0027s legs in an alley three miles to the north. I said, \"No long-distance calls.\" \"Just those two calls, man. That ain\u0027t a long distance. You can just about throw a rock from here to your hotel.\" And I could have walked over last night, after my meeting, when her number failed to answer. Would she still have been alive by then? I imagined her, lying on the bed, waiting for the pills and vodka to do their work, letting the phone ring and ring and ring. Would she have ignored the doorbell the same way? Maybe. Or maybe she\u0027d have been unconscious by then. But I might have sensed that something was wrong, might have summoned the super or kicked the door in, might have gotten to her in time- Oh, sure. And I could have saved Cleopatra from the fucking asp, too, if I hadn\u0027t been born too late. I said, \"You had a key to this place?\" \"I have keys to all their places.\" \"So you just let yourself in.\" He shook his head. \"She had the chain lock on. That\u0027s when I knew something was wrong. I used the key and the door opened two, three inches and stopped on account of the chain, and I knew there was trouble. I busted the chain and came on in and just knew I was gonna find something I didn\u0027t want to see.\" \"You could have gone right out. Left the chain on, gone home.\" \"I thought of that.\" He looked full at me and I was seeing his face less armored than I\u0027d seen it before. \"You know something? When that chain was on, the thought came to me right away that she killed herself. First thing I thought of, only thing I thought of. Reason I broke that chain, I figured maybe she was still alive, maybe I could save her. But it was too late.\" I went to the door, examined the chain lock. The chain itself had not broken; rather, the assembly had ripped loose from its moorings on the doorjamb and hung from the door itself. I hadn\u0027t noticed it when we let ourselves into the apartment. \"You broke this when you came in?\" \"Like I said.\" \"The chain could have been unfastened when you let yourself in. Then you could have locked it and broken it from inside.\" \"Why would I do that?\" \"To make it look as though the apartment was locked from the inside when you got here.\" \"Well, it was. I didn\u0027t have to. I don\u0027t get where you\u0027re comin\u0027 from, man.\" \"I\u0027m just making sure she was locked in when you got here.\" \"Didn\u0027t I say she was?\" \"And you checked the apartment? There wasn\u0027t anybody else here?\" \"Not unless they was hiding in the toaster.\" It was a pretty clear suicide. The only thing problematic was his earlier visit. He\u0027d sat on the knowledge of her death for over twelve hours without reporting it. I thought for a moment. We were north of Sixtieth Street, so that put us in the Twentieth Precinct and out of Durkin\u0027s bailiwick. They\u0027d close it as a suicide unless the medical evidence didn\u0027t match, in which case his earlier visit would come to light later on. I said, \"There\u0027s a few ways we could do it. We could say that you couldn\u0027t reach her all night and you got worried. You talked to me this afternoon and we came over here together. You had a key. You opened the door and we found her and called it in.\" \"All right.\" \"But the chain lock gets in the way. If you weren\u0027t here before, how did it get broken? If somebody else broke it, who was he and what was he doing here?\" \"What if we say we broke it getting in?\" I shook my head. \"That doesn\u0027t work. Suppose they come up with solid evidence that you were here last night. Then I\u0027m caught swearing to a lie. I could lie for you to the extent of treating something you told me as confidential, but I\u0027m not going to get nailed to a lie that cuts across the grain of the facts. No, I have to say the chain lock was broken when we got here.\" \"So it\u0027s been broken for weeks.\" \"Except the break\u0027s fresh. You can see where the screws came out of the wood. The one thing you don\u0027t want to do is get caught in that kind of a lie, where your story and the evidence wind up pointing in different directions. I\u0027ll tell you what I think you have to do.\" \"What\u0027s that?\" \"Tell the truth. You came here, you kicked the door in, she was dead and you split. You drove around, tried to sort things out in your mind. And you wanted to reach me before you did anything, and I was hard to reach. Then you called me and we came here and called it in.\" \"That\u0027s the best way?\" \"It looks like it to me.\" \"All because of that chain thing?\" \"That\u0027s the most obvious loose end. But even without the chain lock you\u0027re better off telling the truth. Look, Chance, you didn\u0027t kill her. She killed herself.\" \"So?\" \"If you didn\u0027t kill her, the best thing you can do is tell the truth. If you\u0027re guilty, the best thing to do is say nothing, not a word. Call a lawyer and keep your mouth shut. But anytime you\u0027re innocent, just tell the truth. It\u0027s easier, it\u0027s simpler, and it saves trying to remember what you said before. Because I\u0027ll tell you one thing. Crooks lie all the time and cops know it and they hate it. And once they get hold of a lie they pull on it until something comes loose. You\u0027re looking to lie to save yourself a hassle, and it might work, it\u0027s an obvious suicide, you might get by with it, but if it doesn\u0027t work you\u0027re going to get ten times the hassle you\u0027re trying to avoid.\" He thought about it, then sighed. \"They\u0027re gonna ask why I didn\u0027t call right away.\" \"Why didn\u0027t you?\" \" \u0027Cause I didn\u0027t know what to do, man. I didn\u0027t know whether to shit or go blind.\" \"Tell them that.\" \"Yeah, I guess.\" \"What did you do after you got out of here?\" \"Last night? Like you said, I drove around some. Drove around the park a few times. Drove over the George Washington Bridge, up the Palisades Parkway. Like a Sunday drive, only a little early.\" He shook his head at the memory. \"Came back, drove over to see Mary Lou. Let myself in, didn\u0027t have to bust no chain lock. She was sleepin\u0027. I got in bed with her, woke her up, stayed with her a little. Then I went on home.\" \"To your house?\" \"To my house. I\u0027m not gonna tell \u0027em about my house.\" \"No need to. You got a little sleep at Mary Lou\u0027s.\" \"I never sleep when someone else is around. I can\u0027t. But they don\u0027t have to know that.\" \"No.\" \"I was at my house for awhile. Then I came on into town, lookin\u0027 for you.\" \"What did you do at your house?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/eight-million-ways-to-die-matthew-scudder-5/page-31.html","bookId":2323,"book":{"id":2323,"title":"Eight Million Ways to Die (Matthew Scudder #5)","description":"Storyline: Eight Million Ways to Die (Matthew Scudder #5) Nobody knows better than Matthew Scudder how far down a person can sink in this city.
