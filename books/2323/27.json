You tired?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"Knockin\u0027 on too many doors. Wha\u0027d this boyfriend of hers do besides buy her all these presents that don\u0027t exist?\"\\n\\n \"He was going to take care of her.\"\\n\\n \"Well, shit,\" he said. \"That\u0027s what I did, man. What else did I do for that girl but take care of her?\"\\n\\n I stretched out on the bed and fell asleep with my clothes on. I\u0027d knocked on too many doors and talked to too many people. I was supposed to see Sunny Hendryx, I\u0027d called and told her I would be coming over, but I took a nap instead. I dreamed of blood and a woman screaming, and I woke up bathed in sweat and with a metallic taste in the back of my mouth.\\n\\n I showered and changed my clothes. I checked Sunny\u0027s number in my notebook, dialed it from the lobby. No answer.\\n\\n I was relieved. I looked at my watch, headed over to St. Paul\u0027s.\\n\\n The speaker was a soft-spoken fellow with receding light brown hair and a boyish face. At first I thought he might be a clergyman.\\n\\n He turned out to be a murderer. He was homosexual, and one night in a blackout he had stabbed his lover thirty or forty times with a kitchen knife. He had, he said quietly, faint memories of the incident, because he\u0027d kept going in and out of blackout, coming to with the knife in his hand, being struck by the horror of it, and then slipping back into the darkness. He\u0027d served seven years at Attica and had been sober three years now on the outside.\\n\\n It was disturbing, listening to him. I couldn\u0027t decide how I felt about him. I didn\u0027t know whether to be glad or sorry that he was alive, that he was out of prison.\\n\\n On the break I got to talking with Jim. Maybe I was reacting to the qualification, maybe I was carrying Kim\u0027s death around with me, but I started talking about all the violence, all the crime, all the killings. \"It gets to me,\" I said. \"I pick up the paper and I read some damn thing or other and it gets to me.\"\\n\\n \"You know that vaudeville routine? \u0027Doctor, it hurts when I do this.\u0027 \u0027So don\u0027t do this!\u0027 \"\\n\\n \"So?\"\\n\\n \"So maybe you should stop picking up the paper.\" I gave him a look. \"I\u0027m serious,\" he said. \"Those stories bother me, too. So do the stories about the world situation. If the news was good they wouldn\u0027t put it in the paper. But one day it struck me, or maybe I got the idea from somebody else, but it came to me that there was no law saying I had to read that crap.\"\\n\\n \"Just ignore it.\"\\n\\n \"Why not?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the ostrich approach, isn\u0027t it? What I don\u0027t look at can\u0027t hurt me?\"\\n\\n \"Maybe, but I see it a little differently. I figure I don\u0027t have to make myself crazy with things I can\u0027t do anything about anyway.\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t see myself overlooking that sort of thing.\"\\n\\n \"Why not?\"\\n\\n I thought of Donna. \"Maybe I\u0027m involved with mankind.\"\\n\\n \"Me too,\" he said. \"I come here, I listen, I talk. I stay sober. That\u0027s how I\u0027m involved in mankind.\"\\n\\n I got some more coffee and a couple of cookies. During the discussion people kept telling the speaker how much they appreciated his honesty.\\n\\n I thought, Jesus, I never did anything like that. And my eyes went to the wall. They hang these slogans on the wall, gems of wisdom like Keep It Simple and Easy Does It, and the sign my eyes went to as if magnetized read There But For The Grace Of God.\\n\\n I thought, no, screw that. I don\u0027t turn murderous in blackouts. Don\u0027t tell me about the grace of God.\\n\\n When it was my turn I passed.\\n\\n Chapter 20\\n\\n Danny Boy held his glass of Russian vodka aloft so that he could look at the light shine through it. \"Purity. Clarity. Precision,\" he said, rolling the words, pronouncing them with elaborate care, \"The best vodka is a razor, Matthew. A sharp scalpel in the hand of a skilled surgeon. It leaves no ragged edges.\"\\n\\n He tipped back the glass and swallowed an ounce or so of purity and clarity. We were at Poogan\u0027s and he was wearing a navy suit with a red stripe that barely showed in the bar\u0027s halflight. I was drinking club soda with lime. At another stop along the way a freckled-faced waitress had informed me that my drink was called a Lime Rickey. I had a feeling I\u0027d never ask for it by that name.\\n\\n Danny Boy said, \"Just to recapitulate. Her name was Kim Dakkinen. She was a big blonde, early twenties, lived in Murray Hill, got killed two weeks ago in the Galaxy Downtowner.\"\\n\\n \"Not quite two weeks ago.\"\\n\\n \"Right. She was one of Chance\u0027s girls. And she had a boyfriend, and that\u0027s what you want. The boyfriend.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right.\"\\n\\n \"And you\u0027re paying for whoever can give you the skinny on this. How much?\"\\n\\n I shrugged. \"A couple of dollars.\"\\n\\n \"Like a bill? Like a half a K? How many dollars?\"\\n\\n I shrugged again. \"I don\u0027t know, Danny. It depends on the information and where it comes from and where it goes. I haven\u0027t got a million dollars to play with but I\u0027m not strapped either.\"\\n\\n \"You said she was one of Chance\u0027s girls.\"\\n\\n \"Right.\"\\n\\n \"You were looking for Chance a little over two weeks ago, Matthew. And then you took me to the boxing matches just so I could point him out to you.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right.\"\\n\\n \"And a couple of days after that, your big blonde had her picture in the papers. You were looking for her pimp, and now she\u0027s dead, and here you are looking for her boyfriend.\"\\n\\n \"So?\"\\n\\n He drank the rest of his vodka. \"Chance know what you\u0027re doing?\"\\n\\n \"He knows.\"\\n\\n \"You talk to him about it?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve talked to him.\"\\n\\n \"Interesting.\" He raised his empty glass to the light, squinted through it. Checking it, no doubt, for purity and clarity and precision. He said, \"Who\u0027s your client?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s confidential.\"\\n\\n \"Funny how people looking for information are never looking to furnish it. No problem. I can ask around, put the word out in certain quarters. That\u0027s what you want?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s what I want.\"\\n\\n \"Do you know anything about this boyfriend?\"\\n\\n \"Like what?\"\\n\\n \"Like is he old or young, wise or straight, married or single? Does he walk to school or take his lunch?\"\\n\\n \"He may have given her presents.\"\\n\\n \"That narrows the field.\"\\n\\n \"I know.\"\\n\\n \"Well,\" he said, \"all we can do is try.\"\\n\\n It was certainly all I could do. I\u0027d gone back to the hotel after the meeting and found a message waiting for me. Call Sunny, it said, and included the number which I\u0027d called earlier. I rang her from the booth in the lobby and got no answer. Didn\u0027t she have a machine? Didn\u0027t they all have machines nowadays?\\n\\n I went to my room but I couldn\u0027t stay in it. I wasn\u0027t tired, the nap had taken the edge off my tiredness, and all the coffee I\u0027d drunk at the meeting had me restless and edgy. I went through my notebook and reread Donna\u0027s poem and it struck me that I was very likely looking for an answer someone else already knew.\\n\\n That\u0027s very often the case in police work. The easiest way to find out something is to ask someone who knows. The hard part is figuring out who that person is, the one with the answer.\\n\\n Who might Kim have confided in? Not the girls I\u0027d talked to so far. Not her neighbor on Thirty-seventh Street. Who, then?\\n\\n Sunny? Maybe. But Sunny wasn\u0027t answering her phone. I tried her again, placing the call through the hotel switchboard.\\n\\n No answer. Just as well. I didn\u0027t much feel like spending the next hour drinking ginger ale with yet another hooker.\\n\\n What had they done, Kim and her faceless friend? If they\u0027d spent all their time behind closed doors, rolling together on a mattress and swearing eternal love, never saying a word to anyone else, then I might be up against it. But maybe they\u0027d gone out, maybe he\u0027d shown her off in some circle or other. Maybe he talked to somebody who talked to somebody else, maybe-\\n\\n I wouldn\u0027t learn the answers in my hotel room. The hell, it wasn\u0027t such a bad night. The rain had quit sometime during the meeting and the wind had died down some. Time to get off my ass, time to take a few taxis and spend a little money. I didn\u0027t seem to be putting it in the bank or stuffing it into poor boxes or shipping it home to Syosset. Might as well spread it around.\\n\\n And so I\u0027d been doing that. Poogan\u0027s Pub was perhaps the ninth place I\u0027d hit and Danny Boy Bell perhaps the fifteenth person I\u0027d talked to. Some of the places were ones I\u0027d visited while looking for Chance, but others were not. I tried saloons in the Village, gin joints in Murray Hill and Turtle Bay, singles bars on First Avenue. I kept doing this after I left Poogan\u0027s, spending frequent small sums on cabs and drink orders, having the same conversation over and over again.\\n\\n No one knew anything. You live in hope when you run that sort of fool\u0027s errand. There\u0027s always the chance that you\u0027ll deliver your spiel and the person you\u0027re talking to will turn and point and say, \"That\u0027s him, that\u0027s her boyfriend, that big guy in the corner over there.\"\\n\\n It almost never happens that way. What does happen, if you\u0027re lucky, is that the word gets around. There may be eight million people in the goddamned city but it\u0027s amazing how they all talk to each other. If I did this right, it wouldn\u0027t be long before a fair share of those eight million knew that a dead whore had a boyfriend and a guy named Scudder was looking for him.\\n\\n Two cabbies in a row refused to go to Harlem. There\u0027s a law that says they have to. If an orderly fare requests a destination anywhere in the five boroughs of New York City, the driver has to take him there. I didn\u0027t bother citing the relevant statute. It was easier to walk a block and catch a subway.\\n\\n The station was a local stop, the platform deserted. The attendant sat in the bulletproof token booth, locked in. I wondered if she felt secure in there. New York taxis have thick Plexiglas partitions to protect the drivers, but the cabbies I\u0027d hailed weren\u0027t willing to go uptown, partition or no.\\n\\n Not long ago an attendant had had a heart attack in one of those token booths. The CPR team couldn\u0027t get into the locked booth to revive him and so the poor bastard had died in there. Still, I suppose they protect more people than they kill.\\n\\n Of course they hadn\u0027t protected the two women at the Broad Channel stop on the A train. A couple of kids had a grudge against an attendant who\u0027d reported them for turnstile jumping, so they\u0027d filled a fire extinguisher with gasoline, pumped it into the booth, and lit a match. The whole booth exploded, incinerated both women. One more way to die.\\n\\n That had been in the paper a year ago. Of course there was no law saying I had to read the papers.\\n\\n I bought tokens. When my train came I rode it uptown. I worked Kelvin Small\u0027s and a few other places on Lenox Avenue. I ran into Royal Waldron at a rib joint, had the same conversation with him I\u0027d been having with everybody else. I drank a cop of coffee on 125th Street, walked the rest of the way to St. Nicholas, had a glass of ginger ale at the bar of Club Cameroon.\\n\\n The statue in Mary Lou\u0027s apartment was from Cameroun. An ancestor statue, encrusted with cowry shells.\\n\\n I found no one at the bar I knew well enough to talk to. I looked at my watch. It was getting late. On Saturday night the bars in New York close an hour early, at three instead of four. I\u0027ve never understood why. Perhaps so that the heavy hitters can sober up in time for church.\\n\\n I motioned to the bartender, asked about after-hours joints. He just looked at me, his face impassive. I found myself laying my rap on him, telling him I was looking for information about Kim\u0027s boyfriend. I knew I wasn\u0027t going to get an answer from him, knew I wouldn\u0027t get the time of day from him, but I was getting the message across all the same. He\u0027d hear me and so would the men on either side of me, and they\u0027d all talk to people, and that was how it worked. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/eight-million-ways-to-die-matthew-scudder-5/page-27.html","bookId":2323,"book":{"id":2323,"title":"Eight Million Ways to Die (Matthew Scudder #5)","description":"Storyline: Eight Million Ways to Die (Matthew Scudder #5) \\n Nobody knows better than Matthew Scudder how far down a person can sink in this city.
