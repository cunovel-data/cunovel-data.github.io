{"id":62972,"no":28,"title":"Page 28","content":"\" \u0027Fraid I can\u0027t help you,\" he said. \"Whatever you lookin\u0027 for, you lookin\u0027 awful far uptown for it.\"\\n\\n I suppose the boy followed me out of the bar. I didn\u0027t notice, and I should have. You have to pay attention to that sort of thing.\\n\\n I was walking along the street, my mind jumping all over the place, from Kim\u0027s mysterious boyfriend to the speaker who\u0027d stabbed his lover. By the time I sensed movement alongside of me there was no time left to react. I was just starting to turn when his hand fastened on my shoulder and propelled me into the mouth of the alley.\\n\\n He came right in after me. He was an inch or so shorter than me but his bushy Afro made up those two inches and more. He was eighteen or twenty or twenty-two, with a drooping moustache and a burn scar on one cheek. He was wearing a flight jacket with zippered pockets and a pair of tight black jeans, and he had a little gun in his hand and it was pointed right at me.\\n\\n He said, \"Motherfucker, fucking motherfucker. Gimme your money, you motherfucker. Gimme it, gimme all of it, gimme it or you dead, you motherfucker.\"\\n\\n I thought, Why didn\u0027t I get to the bank? Why didn\u0027t I leave some of it at my hotel? I thought, Jesus, Mickey could forget getting his teeth straightened, St. Paul\u0027s could forget about their ten percent.\\n\\n And I could forget about tomorrow.\\n\\n \"Motherfucking honky bastard, dirty motherfucker-\"\\n\\n Because he was going to kill me. I reached in my pocket for my wallet and I looked at his eyes and at his finger on the trigger and I knew it. He was working himself up, he was primed, and whatever money I had wasn\u0027t going to be enough for him. He\u0027d be scoring big, better than two grand, but I\u0027d be dead whatever money I had.\\n\\n We were in an alley about five feet wide, just a gap between two brick tenements. Light from a streetlamp spilled into the alley, illuminating the passage for another ten or fifteen yards beyond where we stood. There was rain-soaked litter on the ground, scraps of paper, beer cans, broken bottles.\\n\\n Fine place to die. Fine way to die, not even a very original one. Shot dead by a mugger, crime in the streets, a terse paragraph on a back page.\\n\\n I drew the wallet out of my pocket. I said, \"You can have it, everything I\u0027ve got, you\u0027re welcome to it,\" knowing it wasn\u0027t enough, knowing he\u0027d resolved to shoot me for five dollars or five thousand. I extended the wallet, hand shaking, and I dropped it.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" I said, \"very sorry, I\u0027ll get it,\" and bent to retrieve it, hoping he\u0027d bend forward also, figuring he had to. I bent at the knees and I gathered my feet under me and I thought Now! and I straightened up hard and fast, slapping at the gun as I drove my head full force into his chin.\\n\\n The gun went off, deafening in that enclosed space. I thought I must have been hit but I didn\u0027t feel anything. I grabbed and butted him again, then shoved hard and he stumbled back against the wall behind him, eyes glazed, the gun held loose in his hand. I kicked his wrist and the gun went flying.\\n\\n He came off the wall, his eyes full of murder. I feinted with a left and hit him with my right in the pit of the stomach. He made a retching sound and doubled up, and I grabbed that son of a bitch, one hand gripping the nylon flight jacket, the other tangled up in his mop of hair, and I ran him right into the wall, three quick steps that ended with his face smacking into the bricks. Three, four times I drew him back by the hair and smashed his face into the wall. When I let go of him he dropped like a marionette with the strings cut, sprawling on the floor of the alley.\\n\\n My heart was pounding as if I\u0027d run at top speed up ten flights of stairs. I couldn\u0027t catch my breath. I leaned against the brick wall, panting for breath, waiting for the cops to come.\\n\\n Nobody came. There had been a noisy scuffle, hell, there had been a gunshot, but nobody came and nobody was going to come. I looked down at the young man who would have killed me if he could. He lay with his mouth open, showing teeth broken off at the gumline. His nose was smashed flat against his face and blood flowed from it in a stream.\\n\\n I checked, made sure I wasn\u0027t shot. Sometimes, I understand, you can take a bullet and not feel it at the time. Shock and adrenaline anesthetize the pain. But he\u0027d missed me. I examined the wall behind where I was standing, found a fresh indentation in the brick where the bullet had dug out a chip before ricocheting. I figured out where I\u0027d been standing and calculated that he hadn\u0027t missed me by much.\\n\\n Now what?\\n\\n I found my wallet, put it back in my pocket. I rooted around until I located the gun, a.32-caliber revolver with a spent cartridge in one of its chambers and live rounds in the other five. Had he killed anyone else with it? He\u0027d seemed nervous, so maybe I\u0027d been scheduled to be his first. Then again, maybe some people always get nervous before they pull the trigger, just as some actors always feel anxious before they step onstage.\\n\\n I knelt down and frisked him. He had a switch knife in one pocket, another knife tucked into his sock. No wallet, no ID, but he had a thick roll of bills on his hip. I slipped off the rubber band and gave the roll a fast count. He had over three hundred dollars, the bastard. He hadn\u0027t been looking to make the rent money or score a bag of dope.\\n\\n And what the hell was I going to do with him?\\n\\n Call the cops? And hand them what? No evidence, no witnesses, and the guy on the ground was the one who\u0027d sustained the damages. There was nothing good enough for a courtroom, not even anything to hold him on. They\u0027d rush him to the hospital, fix him up, even give him his money back. No way to prove it was stolen. No way to prove it wasn\u0027t rightfully his.\\n\\n They wouldn\u0027t give him the gun back. But they couldn\u0027t hang a weapons charge on him, either, because I couldn\u0027t prove he\u0027d been carrying it.\\n\\n I put his roll of bills in my own pocket, took out the gun that I\u0027d placed there earlier. I turned the gun over and over in my hand, trying to recall the last time I\u0027d handled one. It had been a while.\\n\\n He lay there, his breath bubbling through the blood in his nose and throat, and I crouched at his side. After a moment or two I stuck the gun into his ruined mouth and let my finger curl around the trigger.\\n\\n Why not?\\n\\n Something stopped me, and it wasn\u0027t fear of punishment, not in this world or the next. I\u0027m not sure what it was, but after what seemed like a long time I sighed and withdrew the gun from his mouth. There were traces of blood on the barrel, glowing like brass in the soft light of the alley. I wiped the gun on his jacket front, put it back in my pocket.\\n\\n I thought, Damn you, goddamn you, what am I going to do with you?\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t kill him and I couldn\u0027t hand him to the cops. What could I do? Leave him there?\\n\\n What else?\\n\\n I stood up. A wave of dizziness came over me and I stumbled, reached out, caught onto the wall for support. After a moment the dizziness passed and I was all right.\\n\\n I took a deep breath, let it out. I bent down again and grabbed him by the feet, dragged him some yards back into the alley to a ledge about a foot high, the top frame of a barred basement window. I stretched him out across the alley on his back with his feet up on the ledge and his head wedged against the opposite wall.\\n\\n I stamped full force on one of his knees, but that didn\u0027t do it. I had to jump into the air and come down with both feet. His left leg snapped like a matchstick on my first attempt, but it took me four times to break the right one. He remained unconscious throughout, moaning a bit, then crying out when the right leg broke.\\n\\n I stumbled, fell, landed on one knee, got up again. Another wave of dizziness hit me, this one accompanied by nausea, and I clung to the wall and gave myself up to dry heaves. The dizziness passed, and the nausea, but I still couldn\u0027t catch my breath and I was shaking like a leaf. I held my hand out in front of me and watched my fingers tremble. I\u0027d never seen anything like that before. I\u0027d faked the shaking when I took out my wallet and dropped it, but this shaking was perfectly real, and I couldn\u0027t control it by force of will. My hands had a will of their own and they wanted to shake.\\n\\n The shakes were even worse on the inside.\\n\\n I turned, took a last look at him. I turned again and made my way over the littered pavement to the street. I was still shaking and it wasn\u0027t getting any better.\\n\\n Well, there was a way to stop the shakes, the ones on the outside and the inner ones as well. There was a specific remedy for that specific disease.\\n\\n Red neon winked at me from the other side of the street. bar, it said.\\n\\n Chapter 21\\n\\n I didn\u0027t cross the street. The kid with the smashed face and broken legs was not the only mugger in the neighborhood, and it struck me that I wouldn\u0027t want to meet another one with drink in me.\\n\\n No, I had to get to my home ground. I was only going to have one drink, maybe two, but I couldn\u0027t guarantee that was all I would have, nor could I say with assurance what one or two drinks would do to me.\\n\\n The safe thing would be to get back to my neighborhood, have one or at the most two shots in a bar, then take a couple of beers back to my room.\\n\\n Except that there was no safe way to drink. Not for me, not anymore. Hadn\u0027t I proved that? How many times did I have to go on proving it?\\n\\n So what was I supposed to do? Shake until I fell apart? I wasn\u0027t going to be able to sleep without a drink. I wasn\u0027t going to be able to sit still without a drink, for Christ\u0027s sake.\\n\\n Well, fuck it. I had to have one. It was medicinal. Any doctor who looked at me would prescribe it.\\n\\n Any doctor? How about that intern at Roosevelt? I could feel his hand on my shoulder, right where the mugger had grabbed me to shove me into the alley. \"Look at me. Listen to me. You\u0027re an alcoholic. If you drink you\u0027ll die.\"\\n\\n I\u0027d die anyway, in one of eight million ways. But if I had the choice, at least I could die closer to home.\\n\\n I walked over to the curb. A gypsy cab, the only kind that cruises Harlem, slowed as it approached. The driver, a middle-aged Hispanic woman wearing a brimmed cap over kinky red hair, decided I looked all right. I got in the back seat, closed the door, told her to take me to Fifty-eighth and Ninth.\\n\\n On the way there my mind was all over the place. My hands were still trembling, though not so violently as before, but the internal shakes were as bad as ever. The ride seemed to take forever, and then before I knew it the woman was asking me which corner I wanted. I told her to pull up in front of Armstrong\u0027s. When the light changed she nosed the cab across the intersection and stopped where I\u0027d told her. When I made no move she turned around to see what was wrong.\\n\\n I\u0027d just remembered that I couldn\u0027t get a drink at Armstrong\u0027s. Of course they might have forgotten by now that Jimmy had eighty-sixed me, but maybe they hadn\u0027t, and I felt myself burning with resentment already at the thought of walking in there and being refused service. No, fuck them, I wouldn\u0027t walk through their goddamned door.\\n\\n Where, then? Polly\u0027s would be closed, they never ran all the way to closing hour. Farrell\u0027s?\\n\\n That was where I\u0027d had the first drink after Kim\u0027s death. I\u0027d had eight sober days before I picked up that drink. I remembered that drink. Early Times, it was.\\n\\n Funny how I always remember what brand I was drinking. It\u0027s all the same crap, but that\u0027s the sort of detail that sticks in your mind.\\n\\n I\u0027d heard someone make that very observation at a meeting a while back.\\n\\n What did I have now? Four days? I could go up to my room and just make myself stay there and when I woke up I\u0027d be starting my fifth day.\\n\\n Except that I\u0027d never fall asleep. I wouldn\u0027t even stay in the room. I\u0027d try, but I couldn\u0027t stay anywhere, not the way I felt right now, not with only my own whirling mind to keep me company. If I didn\u0027t drink now I\u0027d drink an hour from now. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/eight-million-ways-to-die-matthew-scudder-5/page-28.html","bookId":2323,"book":{"id":2323,"title":"Eight Million Ways to Die (Matthew Scudder #5)","description":"Storyline: Eight Million Ways to Die (Matthew Scudder #5) \\n Nobody knows better than Matthew Scudder how far down a person can sink in this city.
