{"id":62973,"no":29,"title":"Page 29","content":"\"Mister? You okay?\" I blinked at the woman, then dug my wallet out of my pocket and found a twenty. \"I want to make a phone call,\" I said. \"From the booth right there on the corner. You take this and wait for me. All right?\" Maybe she\u0027d drive off with the twenty. I didn\u0027t really care. I walked to the corner, dropped a dime, stood there listening to the dial tone. It was too late to call. What time was it? After two, much too late for a social call. Hell, I could go to my room. All I had to do was stay put for an hour and I\u0027d be in the clear. At three the bars would close. So? There was a deli that would sell me beer, legally or not. There was an after-hours on Fifty-first, way west between Eleventh and Twelfth. Unless it had closed by now; I hadn\u0027t been there in a long time. There was a bottle of Wild Turkey in Kim Dakkinen\u0027s front closet. And I had her key in my pocket. That scared me. The booze was right there, accessible to me at any hour, and if I went there I\u0027d never stop after one or two drinks. I\u0027d finish the bottle, and when I did there were a lot of other bottles to keep it company. I made my call. She\u0027d been sleeping. I heard that in her voice when she answered the phone. I said, \"It\u0027s Matt. I\u0027m sorry to call you so late.\" \"That\u0027s all right. What time is it? God, it\u0027s after two.\" \"I\u0027m sorry. \"It\u0027s all right. Are you okay, Matthew? \"No.\" \"Have you been drinking?\" \"No.\" \"Then you\u0027re okay.\" \"I\u0027m falling apart,\" I said. \"I called you because it was the only way I could think of to keep from drinking.\" \"You did the right thing.\" \"Can I come over?\" There was a pause. Never mind, I thought. Forget it. One quick drink at Farrell\u0027s before they closed, then back to the hotel. Never should have called her in the first place. \"Matthew, I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s a good idea. Just take it an hour at a time, a minute at a time if you have to, and call me as much as you want. I don\u0027t mind if you wake me, but-\" I said, \"I almost got killed half an hour ago. I beat a kid up and broke his legs for him. I\u0027m shaking like I never shook before in my life. The only thing that\u0027s going to make me feel right is a drink and I\u0027m afraid to take one and scared I\u0027ll do it anyway. I thought being with someone and talking with someone might get me through it but it probably wouldn\u0027t anyway, and I\u0027m sorry, I shouldn\u0027t have called. I\u0027m not your responsibility. I\u0027m sorry.\" \"Wait!\" \"I\u0027m here.\" \"There\u0027s a clubhouse on St. Marks Place where they have meetings all night long on the weekends. It\u0027s in the book, I can look it up for you.\" \"Sure.\" \"You won\u0027t go, will you?\" \"I can\u0027t talk up at meetings. Forget it, Jan. I\u0027ll be all right.\" \"Where are you?\" \"Fifty-eighth and Ninth.\" \"How long will it take you to get here?\" I glanced over at Armstrong\u0027s. My gypsy cab was still parked there. \"I\u0027ve got a cab waiting,\" I said. \"You remember how to get here?\" \"I remember.\" The cab dropped me in front of Jan\u0027s six-story loft building on Lispenard. The meter had eaten up most of the original twenty dollars. I gave her another twenty to go with it. It was too much but I was feeling grateful, and could afford to be generous. I rang Jan\u0027s bell, two long and three short, and went out in front so that she could toss the key down to me. I rode the industrial elevator to the fifth floor and stepped out into her loft. \"That was quick,\" she said. \"You really did have a cab waiting.\" She\u0027d had time to dress. She was wearing old Lee jeans and a flannel shirt with a red-and-black checkerboard pattern. She\u0027s an attractive woman, medium height, well fleshed, built more for comfort than for speed. A heart-shaped face, her hair dark brown salted with gray and hanging to her shoulders. Large well-spaced gray eyes. No makeup. She said, \"I made coffee. You don\u0027t take anything in it, do you?\" \"Just bourbon.\" \"We\u0027re fresh out. Go sit down, I\u0027ll get the coffee.\" When she came back with it I was standing by her Medusa, tracing a hair-snake with my fingertip. \"Her hair reminded me of your girl here,\" I said. \"She had blonde braids but she wrapped them around her head in a way that made me think of your Medusa.\" \"Who?\" \"A woman who got killed. I don\u0027t know where to start.\" \"Anywhere,\" she said. I talked for a long time and I skipped all over the place, from the beginning to that night\u0027s events and back and forth again. She got up now and then to get us more coffee, and when she came back I\u0027d start in where I left off. Or I\u0027d start somewhere else. It didn\u0027t seem to matter. I said, \"I didn\u0027t know what the hell to do with him. After I\u0027d knocked him out, after I\u0027d searched him. I couldn\u0027t have him arrested and I couldn\u0027t stand the thought of letting him go. I was going to shoot him but I couldn\u0027t do it. I don\u0027t know why. If I\u0027d just smacked his head against the wall a couple more times it might have killed him, and I\u0027ll tell you, I\u0027d have been glad of it. But I couldn\u0027t shoot him while he was lying there unconscious.\" \"Of course not.\" \"But I couldn\u0027t leave him there, I didn\u0027t want him walking the streets. He\u0027d just get another gun and do it again. So I broke his legs. Eventually the bones\u0027ll knit and he\u0027ll be able to resume his career, but in the meantime he\u0027s off the streets.\" I shrugged. \"It doesn\u0027t make any sense. But I couldn\u0027t think of anything else to do.\" \"The important thing is you didn\u0027t drink.\" \"Is that the important thing?\" \"I think so.\" \"I almost drank. If I\u0027d been in my own neighborhood, or if I hadn\u0027t reached you. God knows I wanted to drink. I still want to drink.\" \"But you\u0027re not going to.\" \"No.\" \"Do you have a sponsor, Matthew?\" \"No.\" \"You should. It\u0027s a big help.\" \"How?\" \"Well, a sponsor\u0027s someone you can call anytime, someone you can tell anything to.\" \"You have one?\" She nodded. \"I called her after I spoke to you.\" \"Why?\" \"Because I was nervous. Because it calms me down to talk to her. Because I wanted to see what she would say.\" \"What did she say?\" \"That I shouldn\u0027t have told you to come over.\" She laughed. \"Fortunately, you were already on your way.\" \"What else did she say?\" The big gray eyes avoided mine. \"That I shouldn\u0027t sleep with you.\" \"Why\u0027d she say that?\" \"Because it\u0027s not a good idea to have relationships during the first year. And because it\u0027s a terrible idea to get involved with anybody who\u0027s newly sober.\" \"Christ,\" I said. \"I came over because I was jumping out of my skin, not because I was horny.\" \"I know that.\" \"Do you do everything your sponsor says?\" \"I try to.\" \"Who is this woman that she\u0027s the voice of God on earth?\" \"Just a woman. She\u0027s my age, actually she\u0027s a year and a half younger. But she\u0027s been sober almost six years.\" \"Long time.\" \"It seems like a long time to me.\" She picked up her cup, saw it was empty, put it down again. \"Isn\u0027t there someone you could ask to be your sponsor?\" \"Is that how it works? You have to ask somebody?\" \"That\u0027s right.\" \"Suppose I asked you?\" She shook her head. \"In the first place, you should get a male sponsor. In the second place, I haven\u0027t been sober long enough. In the third place we\u0027re friends.\" \"A sponsor shouldn\u0027t be a friend?\" \"Not that kind of friend. An AA friend. In the fourth place, it ought to be somebody in your home group so you have frequent contact.\" I thought unwillingly of Jim. \"There\u0027s a guy I talk to sometimes.\" \"It\u0027s important to pick someone you can talk to.\" \"I don\u0027t know if I can talk to him. I suppose I could.\" \"Do you respect his sobriety?\" \"I don\u0027t know what that means.\" \"Well, do you-\" \"This evening I told him I got upset by the stories in the newspapers. All the crime in the streets, the things people keep doing to each other. It gets to me, Jan.\" \"I know it does.\" \"He told me to quit reading the papers. Why are you laughing?\" \"It\u0027s just such a program thing to say.\" \"People talk the damnedest crap. \u0027I lost my job and my mother\u0027s dying of cancer and I\u0027m going to have to have my nose amputated but I didn\u0027t drink today so that makes me a winner.\u0027 \" \"They really sound like that, don\u0027t they?\" \"Sometimes. What\u0027s so funny?\" \" \u0027I\u0027m going to have my nose amputated.\u0027 A nose amputated?\" \"Don\u0027t laugh,\" I said. \"It\u0027s a serious problem.\" A little later she was telling me about a member of her home group whose son had been killed by a hit-and-run driver. The man had gone to a meeting and talked about it, drawing strength from the group, and evidently it had been an inspirational experience all around. He\u0027d stayed sober, and his sobriety had enabled him to deal with the situation and bolster the other members of his family while fully experiencing his own grief. I wondered what was so wonderful about being able to experience your grief. Then I found myself speculating what would have happened some years ago if I\u0027d stayed sober after an errant bullet of mine ricocheted and fatally wounded a six-year-old girl named Estrellita Rivera. I\u0027d dealt with the resultant feelings by pouring bourbon on them. It had certainly seemed like a good idea at the time. Maybe it hadn\u0027t been. Maybe there were no shortcuts, no detours. Maybe you had to go through things. I said, \"You don\u0027t worry about getting hit by a car in New York. But it happens here, the same as anywhere else. Did they ever catch the driver?\" \"No.\" \"He was probably drunk. They usually are.\" \"Maybe he was in a blackout. Maybe he came to the next day and never knew what he\u0027d done.\" \"Jesus,\" I said, and thought of that night\u0027s speaker, the man who stabbed his lover. \"Eight million stories in the Emerald City. And eight million ways to die.\" \"The naked city.\" \"Isn\u0027t that what I said?\" \"You said the Emerald City.\" \"I did? Where did I get that from?\" \"The Wizard of Oz. Remember? Dorothy and Toto in Kansas? Judy Garland going over the rainbow?\" \"Of course I remember.\" \" \u0027Follow the Yellow Brick Road.\u0027 It led to the Emerald City, where the wonderful wizard lived.\" \"I remember. The Scarecrow, the Tin Man, the Cowardly Lion, I remember the whole thing. But where\u0027d I get emeralds from?\" \"You\u0027re an alcoholic,\" she suggested. \"You\u0027re missing a couple of brain cells, that\u0027s all.\" I nodded. \"Must be it,\" I said. The sky was turning light when we went to sleep. I slept on the couch wrapped up in a couple of spare blankets. At first I thought I wouldn\u0027t be able to sleep, but the tiredness came over me like a towering wave. I gave up and let it take me wherever it wanted.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/eight-million-ways-to-die-matthew-scudder-5/page-29.html","bookId":2323,"book":{"id":2323,"title":"Eight Million Ways to Die (Matthew Scudder #5)","description":"Storyline: Eight Million Ways to Die (Matthew Scudder #5) Nobody knows better than Matthew Scudder how far down a person can sink in this city.
