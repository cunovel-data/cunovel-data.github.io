He had been horrible enough to Christiana during their short marriage, and she was not going to allow the traditional period of mourning to ruin her sisters\u0027 debuts as well. So she decides to put him on ice and go on as if nothing\u0027s happened ... \\n Until the real earl appears. Richard Fairgrave had every intention of confronting his villainous twin who had robbed him of his name and title ... only to discover that he had died. Quietly assuming his identity, Richard must now deal with a maddening desire for his ravishing inherited wife --- certainly a gold digger and possibly a murderess. And Christiana must deal with an unwanted new husband ... and they both must figure out what to do before the ice melts.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-countess-madison-sisters-1.jpg","author":"Lynsay Sands","type":"Historical","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","category":{"id":20,"name":"Historical","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
