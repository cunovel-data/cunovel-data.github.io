{"id":16385,"no":5,"title":"Chapter 5","content":"Perhaps the best way to pursue the next episodes in the quest is in the words of Johnny Blair, the Rhodes Scholar, who jotted down some notes in a journal he kept: We got to Wolverhampton 12:25, Ingersoll time. Had a jolly trip on the train, all the Scorps laying bets as to who would be first to meet Kathleen. I lay low, but did some planning. Didn\u0027t want to let these English blighters get ahead of me, especially after all the ragging Indiana Joe got in the story. Train stopped at Birmingham at noon. My tobacco pouch had run empty, and I hopped out to buy some Murray\u0027s at the newsstand. Saw the prettiest flapper of my life on the platform—the real English type; tweed suit, dark hair, gray eyes, and cheeks like almond blossoms. She had on a blue tam-o\u0027 shanter. Loveliest figure I ever saw, perfect ankle, but the usual heavy brogues on her feet. Why do English girls always wear woollen stockings? Was so taken with her I almost missed the train. She got into a third-class compartment farther up the train. The others were all bickering in the smoking carriage, so they didn\u0027t see her. I scored over the rest of the crowd when we got to Wolvers. They had all brought heavy portmanteaus, containing all their vacation baggage. My idea was, go light when chasing the Grail. Had only my rucksack, left rest of my stuff at coll., to be forwarded later. While the other chaps were getting their stuff out of the goods van I spotted Miss Flapper getting off the train. She got into a hansom. Just by dumb luck I was standing near. I heard her say to cabby: “318, Bancroft Road!” Lord, was I tickled? I kept mum. Most of the fellows took cabs, on account of their luggage, but Goblin and I hoofed it. Wolverhampton seems a dingy place for Kathleen to live! Fine old church, though, and lovely market place. We kept our eyes open for Bancroft Road, but saw no sign. When we got to the Blue Boar, lunch was all ready for us in the coffee room. Landlord tickled to death at our arrival. Wonderful cheddar cheese, and archdeacon ale. We made quite a ceremony of it—all drank Kathleen\u0027s health, and on the stroke of two we got up from the table. All the others beat it off immediately in different directions—looking for Bancroft Road, I expect. I had an idea that more finesse would be needed. I started off with the others, then pretended I had left my pipe, and came back to the Boar. I was going to look up the town directory, to find Kathleen\u0027s name—knowing the address, that would be easy. But there was Goblin doing the same thing! We both laughed and looked it up together. The name at 318, Bancroft Road was Kent, Philip Kent, F.S.A., Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, I suppose: the book put him down as an “antiquarian.” Kathleen\u0027s father, evidently. Goblin disappeared in that noiseless way of his, and I lit a pipe and pondered. The fellows had been full of wild suggestions as to what they would do when they got to 318, Bancroft Road. One was going to be a book agent and get into the house that way. Another said he would be the grocer\u0027s man and make friends with the cook. Someone else suggested dressing up as a plumber or gas-man, and going there to fix some imaginary leak. Knowing that the Kents were not fools, I imagined it wouldn\u0027t be long before they\u0027d get wise to the fact that that bunch of dreadnoughts was picketing the house. Probably they\u0027d put the police on them. Also, there\u0027s nobody harder to disguise than an English \u0027varsity man. He gives himself away at every turn. If “Fred” was around he\u0027d be sure to smell a rat. One of those chaps would be likely to fake himself up as a plumber, and get in the house on some pretext or other—still wearing his wrist-watch! I thought it wouldn\u0027t be a bad idea to stay away from Bancroft Road for a while and try to pull wires from a distance: The Blue Boar Inn—a very nice old house, by the way—looks out over the old Wolverhampton market place. In one corner of the square I had noticed a little post office. You can send a telegram from any post office in England, and I thought that would be my best entering wedge. The word “antiquarian” in the directory had given me a notion. On a blank I composed the following message, after some revisions: MISS KATHLEEN KENT, 318, Bancroft Road, WOLVERHAMPTON. My friend John Blair of Trinity now in Wolverhampton for historical study staying at Blue Boar nice chap American may he call on you if so send him a line sorry can\u0027t write hurt hand playing soccer love to all. JOE. This was taking a long chance, but was the best move I could think of. I asked the lady behind the counter to mark the telegram as though it came from Oxford. She said she could not do so, but I happened to have a five-bob piece in my pocket and that persuaded her. I convinced her that it was a harmless joke. I didn\u0027t see that there was anything further to be done immediately. If the telegram brought no word I should have to think up something else. In the meantime, if I was to pose as an antiquarian investigator I had better get up some dope on the history of Wolverhampton. I poked about until I found a bookshop, where I bought a little pamphlet about the town, and studied a map. Bancroft Road was out toward the northern suburbs. A little talk with the bookseller brought me the information that Mr. Kent was one of his best customers, a pleasant and simple-minded gentleman of sixty whose only hobby was the history of the region. He had written a book called “Memorials of Old Staffordshire,” but unfortunately I couldn\u0027t get a copy. The bookseller said it was out of print. Then I went to have a look at St. Philip\u0027s Church, a fine old Norman pile with some lovely brasses and crusaders\u0027 tombs. Here I had a piece of luck—fell in with the vicar. One of the jolly old port-wine and knicker-bocker sort: an old Oxford man, as it happened. I pumped him a little about the history of the church, and in his delight at finding an American who cared for such matters he talked freely. “Why,” he kept on saying, with a kind of pathetic enthusiasm, “I thought all you Americans were interested in was Standard Oil and tinned beef.” Finally he invited me over to the vicarage for tea. As I sat by his fire and ate toasted muffins I couldn\u0027t help chuckling to think how different this was from the other Scorpions\u0027 plan of attack. They were probably all biting their nails up and down Bancroft Road trying to carry the fort by direct assault. It\u0027s amazing how things turn out: just as I was wondering how to give the conversation a twist in the right direction, the vicar said: “If you\u0027re really interested in the history of this region you should certainly have a talk with old Mr. Kent. He\u0027s our leading antiquarian, and knows more about the Stour Valley than any one else. He says there was a skirmish fought here in 1645 that all the books have overlooked. The Battle of Wolverhampton, he calls it. He wrote a little pamphlet about it once.” I assured the good parson that my eagerness to know more about the Battle of Wolverhampton was unbounded. I nearly spilled my tea in my excitement. “Is that Mr. Kent of 318, Bancroft Road?” I asked. “Yes,” answered the vicar. “How did you know?” “They told me about him at the bookshop.” I explained that I was in Wolverhampton for a day or so only, and finally the excellent man came across with the suggestion I was panting for. “Well,” he said, “as it happens, I have one or two calls to make in that direction this evening. If you care to have me do so, I\u0027ll speak to Mr. Kent about you, and he can make an appointment. You said you were stopping at the Blue Boar?” I thanked him with such warmth that his eyes twinkled. “My dear fellow,” he said, “your enthusiasm does you great credit. I wish you all success in your thesis.” I got back to the Boar feeling that I had done a very good afternoon\u0027s work indeed. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3213/87707.html","bookId":723,"book":{"id":723,"title":"Kathleen","description":"简介： The Scorpions were to meet at eight o\u0027clock and before that hour Kenneth Forbes had to finish the first chapter of a serial story.
