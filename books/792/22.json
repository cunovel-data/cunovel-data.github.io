{"id":38354,"no":22,"title":"XXII WOLVES","content":"The pastime of draw poker was engaging the energies of Sykes, McClure, Foyle, Snoopy Bill and their gang of familiars. The hour ran long past the closing time of eleven P.M. \\n\\n \\n\\n Though stakes had flown high the game had failed to catch the interest of Rob McClure. He played his hand with a detachment that threw him open to heavy losses. So far he had escaped. His mind was the battle ground of a struggle he had not calculated on. Sykes watched him covertly all evening, striving to pierce the mask of his unsmiling face. It delighted him to trace the ruthless lines about the mouth. On the other hand it perturbed him not a little to see distinct evidences of indecision. With the deliberate purpose of fostering the reckless mood Sykes kept up a perpetual toasting. He toasted the pot, the queens and the aces all in turn, drinking lightly himself while McClure took copious draughts. With all his apathy McClure won regularly while Sykes lost as steadily. The double-plying of the farmer with the frequently recurring toast and an unswerving success in the game was fast realizing Sykes\u0027 purpose. He was growing reckless in his sullen vindictiveness while the inner struggle was evident in strange moments of aberration. A gloominess was gathering in his befuddled brain. This greatly puzzled Sykes and alarmed him as well. He watched like a spider in his lair. \\n\\n \\n\\n Suddenly he leaned forward. A change had come over the farmer. McClure sat in his place, his head resting heavily upon his left hand. His cards lay upon the table before him face up. The game was forgotten. His eyes were reading the contents of a half-emptied glass with a stare repellent in its fierce amazement. Holding the glass tightly in his right hand he trained bulging eyes on some sight within. \\n\\n \\n\\n At that moment Rob McClure was a physical wreck rolling helplessly on a rough sea. At best the conscience of the man was atrophied. Now it was incapable as well. The countenance, spacious with a native bigness, was marred by the double bestiality of bibber and rogue. The rudderless mind was mighty with unleashed desire. Amid the wreck of faculties sat the will, an ominous thing living, uncontrolled, with strength unimpaired, ready to strike adder-like in any direction. \\n\\n \\n\\n Oblivious of the commotion of the game he beheld the figment of his drugged brain rising to view in the glass of drink. His face grew black with an anger horrible to behold. Amid the gleam of the liquor two faces took nebulous shape, growing in definition the longer he watched. At length they rose into view through the bubbles and froth. They vanished magically only to reappear with a tripled vividness of shape. They were living faces, of beautiful women sorrowful with a gentle reproach that stirred some tender, sleeping thing within him, while at the same instant it bated the savage beast glaring out of his eyes. As he looked, one instant fearful, the next enraged, the tender thing was suddenly crushed and the beast sprang from his lair. A wild vengefulness gleamed in his eyes as he sprang to his feet with a weird cry. Swinging his arm aloft he hurled the glass crashing upon the table before him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ha!\" he cried laughing horribly. \"That will shut your blankety eyes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Cunningly he searched the ring of startled faces. As he looked something clicked in the brain and the hallucination passed. His face resumed its normal expression, though an inkling of what he had just done remained dimly with him. \\n\\n \\n\\n The others sprang to their feet in alarm, striking sudden attitudes of defense. An instant\u0027s contemplation disclosed to all his drunken state. His eyes were fixed curiously upon the shivered glass. A chorus of raillery broke out. But McClure did not smile. His face was dark. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What the ——?\" jollied Snoopy Bill. \\n\\n \\n\\n Stepping to the door he stooped down and yelled through the keyhole: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hi you, Louie! No more strong stuff for McClure. He\u0027s seeing \u0027em. Bring a tray of lemonade.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n McClure was in an unfortunate mood for the jibe. Stung by the roar of applause he leaped at Snoopy Bill in swift reprisal. Gripping him savagely by the throat he applied a strangle clutch. Snoopy\u0027s head bobbed back and he sank to the floor with blackening face. With shouts of alarm the others sprang toward the two men. Tearing away McClure\u0027s deadly grasp they pinned him to the floor. The struggle aided him to recover his mental poise. Looking up at them with a sane glance he said quietly: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m through. Let me up.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Released, he regained his feet and resumed his chair. \\n\\n \\n\\n Snoopy Bill\u0027s face was livid as he sank panting into his place. Into his eyes crept a vengeful light. He glanced sullenly about. He, too, had imbibed over freely. As he recovered the sense of outrage deepened and he proceeded to wreak immediate revenge. With the slyness of the inebriate he reached out and seized his glass. Fixing direful eyes on McClure he drew back his hand. But the murderous throw was interrupted. His wrist was suddenly caught in the vise-like grip of Sykes\u0027 long fingers. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Better not, Bill,\" he admonished in a low voice. \"Rob is dead drunk. Don\u0027t even know he fouled you. If you let him have that you\u0027ll be up against murder.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He\u0027s a blankety coward,\" was the angry retort. \"I\u0027ll get him yet. Watch me bust up this gang. By the blankety blank I\u0027ll tip Pullar himself.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Above the growls this threat produced rose the voice of Sykes roaring blasphemously at Swale who stood in the open door with mouth agape. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You bottle washing smuggler!\" he cried. \"Fill up a tray of your dummest swill and hand it out on the double quick. No more poison or we\u0027ll blow you up.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Satisfied that the brawl was over Swale disappeared with the desired alacrity. \\n\\n \\n\\n McClure\u0027s assault had tapped a smoldering mine. Though the game was resumed neither McClure nor Snoopy Bill evinced any interest, while the latter continued to breathe vengeance. Beside him sat Ford who too was showing little interest in the cards. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Come, Ford!\" challenged Snoopy Bill in a stage whisper. \"I\u0027ll stump you to split on the hounds. I\u0027m quitting.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Cut the ragging!\" called Sykes appeasingly. \"This bad stuff all comes from drinking Swale\u0027s rotten whiskey. Here comes the best ever.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Swale appeared with a loaded tray. The glasses were passed around. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Keep it!\" said Snoopy Bill. \"I tell you I\u0027m quitting.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Me too,\" said Nick Ford, pushing his glass away. \"I reckon I\u0027m with Bill,\" said he rising. \"This gang\u0027s never been right. But it hit the rocks good and hard about the time Hank Foyle blew in. I know I ain\u0027t a Sunday-school teacher but I\u0027ve felt like a skunk since that steal of Pullar\u0027s farm. I\u0027ve a sneaking idea there\u0027s some scurvy game on right now. Rolling an old man is bad enough but I draw the line at fouling a woman. I\u0027m through.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Nick\u0027s words had a startling effect. The drinkers paused in their act of tossing the glass. There was a passage of swift glances between Sykes and McClure. The hush of a deep calm fell on the room, broken by a wild laugh from Snoopy Bill. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Keep it up, old top!\" he shouted, slapping Ford on the back. \"Cough it out. Spit up the facts. We\u0027ll enjoy \u0027em.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Ford gave a knowing smirk. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, Bill,\" was his insinuating reply. \"I ain\u0027t telling all I know. I\u0027ll let it off at the regular time.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n For McClure and Sykes his words had a disquieting significance. How much did Ford know? Beyond all doubt he had an inkling of the facts. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"None of this little party know what Nick is raving about,\" said Sykes. \"Nick\u0027s had a peculiar dream. Louie\u0027s poison got him a little differently from Rob. Let us forget the gab and every man hit the bottom of his glass. There\u0027s a tankful left. Watch us touch the high spots in this little game.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He pointed to the cards. \\n\\n \\n\\n There was a roar of applause. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No you don\u0027t,\" said Nick determinedly. \"It\u0027s bye, bye, boys, for me. I\u0027m taking a walk to myself.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Take me along,\" cried Snoopy Bill, rising and joining him. \\n\\n \\n\\n The gang watched the two delinquents lock arms and pass out into the barroom. No man made a move to obstruct them. Any such attempt would have been organized by either McClure or Sykes and for some reason they were silent. \\n\\n \\n\\n With the game broken up the party went out. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Come over to the office,\" whispered Sykes to McClure and Foyle. \"Ford\u0027s next our game. We\u0027ll have to finish with a spurt if we are to pull off a win.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The interview lasted a long time. They had barely entered upon it when a shadow crept up and hung low near the window. With surprising temerity the stealthy visitant lighted a cigarette. In the light of the match appeared the dark visage of Nick Ford. He had sprung a bluff on the plotters, basing his charge on a phrase or two he had overheard. His guess had been shrewd. Satisfied that some conspiracy was afoot he decided to shadow the three men with the result that he now sat at the window listening with alert ears to the conversation going on within. He caught significant parts of their talk, enough to discover that some scheme was being concocted against the little school-teacher. He listened breathlessly in effort to learn complete details, but without success. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hang my ears!\" was his impatient whisper. \"Why can\u0027t I get it all?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He had learned enough, however, to present him with a serious challenge. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They\u0027ve got me!\" he whispered half fearfully. \"Sykes has piles of money. If I chuck him he\u0027ll break me sure.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Hearing signs of a break-up of the party he stole away to his home debating the momentous demand the facts he had learned now suddenly made upon his conscience. It was easier to threaten to split on the gang than to come through with the threat, for Nick Ford was no squealer. It was dawn before he arrived at a conclusion. Finally he decided. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah, Brubbie!\" he breathed softly. \"For her sake I\u0027ll do it. She saved you from the wolves. Yes, I\u0027ll do it. I\u0027ll let Ned Pullar know all.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1890/54561.html","bookId":792,"book":{"id":792,"title":"The Valley of Gold","description":"简介： The east wind blew furiously, beating gray sheets down the streaming panes.
