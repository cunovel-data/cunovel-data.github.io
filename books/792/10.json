{"id":38342,"no":10,"title":"X THE DREAMER","content":"The watcher stepped back into the shelter of the maples. She had emerged from them but a moment before and had been on the point of addressing the worker when her capricious will deterred her. She was looking upon the great figure of a man. He was aged, nearing the fullness of the allotted span. His shoulders, however, were square and his back straight. His form rose to a towering height, retaining its lines of strength and was crowned by a shapely head with its resplendent glory of long white hair. The face was noble with a touch of gentleness. The intelligent eyes had a masterful light mingling with the dreaminess of them, while his cheeks had the soft rotundity of a child\u0027s and the roses of a girl. Before her stood the father of Ned Pullar. Often had she heard of him. This was the first time she had really beheld him. She was very surprised, agreeably so. \n \n The old man was busy flailing a bag of chaff. So absorbed was he in his employment that he was rudely startled when a woman\u0027s voice accosted him gently. \n \n \"Mr. Pullar, I believe!\" \n \n Looking up suddenly he detected a small girlish figure in white. Her face was attractive with a bright friendliness that set him instantly at ease. \n \n \"I am highly honoured,\" was his reply as he set down his stick and bowed with courtly stateliness. \"Is it the little teacher I have the pleasure of greeting?\" \n \n \"I am Mary McClure!\" \n \n The old man walked over and held out his hand with Western hospitality. \n \n \"Welcome to The Craggs, lassie. The lad, Ned, has been telling me much about you. Will you not sit down?\" \n \n He placed a rustic chair before her. \n \n \"I have been waiting for you to call on your new neighbour,\" said Mary with a smile as she accepted the proffered chair. \"But you have not favoured us yet. I am afraid you will find me a very impatient and exacting neighbour, Mr. Pullar.\" \n \n His eyes twinkled at her speech. \n \n \"Well now, that is a pretty rub,\" said he amusedly. \"I shall have to hunt up my visiting cards and call around.\" \n \n \"Now, see that you do,\" was the girl\u0027s reply as she shook an accusing finger at him. \"But you must not entertain now, Mr. Pullar. I came over to watch you at work. I am curious to know why you were belabouring that poor sack so roundly.\" \n \n The old man laughed delightedly. \n \n \"I will tell you all about it,\" was the reply. \"I am threshing the wheat that is in it.\" \n \n \"But why do you have to do that with a stick? Is Ned not the best thresher along the Valley?\" \n \n A proud look came into the old man\u0027s eyes. \n \n \"Do you think so, lass?\" \n \n \"Indeed I do. And so does the whole settlement.\" \n \n \"It is so, I believe,\" was the frank agreement. \"But Ned does not thresh this. Those bags are filled with rare wheat heads selected from our head-row plots. For them I use the flail.\" \n \n He had pointed to where a line of a dozen bulging grain sacks swung on a stout rope between posts. \n \n Mary\u0027s eyes opened. \n \n \"Mr. Pullar,\" said she engagingly, \"I have heard most interesting rumours of what a wizard you are with seeds. One man told me solemnly that he believed you could grow a good crop in a field of dry dust. Is it true that you have developed a new variety of wheat?\" \n \n For a moment the old man did not answer. Instead he read earnestly the beautiful, vivacious face of the girl and the eyes deep in their intelligence. \n \n \"I believe, lassie, you would understand,\" was his satisfied reflection. \"Would you like to hear the truth about The Red Knight?\" \n \n Mary looked steadily into the eyes above her. She did not comprehend the meaning of his question but she was fascinated by the noble enthusiasm that swept over the fine old face. \n \n \"Tell me. Will you?\" was her soft voiced reply. \n \n \"Come with me,\" said he. \"I will show you something.\" \n \n The tone of his voice deeply impressed her. She knew that she was about to venture into the sacred recesses of a life. She followed him to the porch where rested a tub. Seizing the handle he pulled it out into the sunlight. Lifting a covering he disclosed to her eyes a mass of grain—beautiful wheat, brown-gold in colour, with the wealthy red tinge that tints the peerless milling kernel. The plump, red berries suggested to her heaps of tiny, golden pebbles. She was astonished and silent. \n \n \"It is The Red Knight,\" said he simply, stooping and dipping up a handful. She observed how fondly he held it in the palm of his great hand. \n \n \"It is very dear to you,\" was her gentle remark. \n \n Once again he studied her eyes. They looked up at him with a clear-eyed rapture that provoked his grateful confidence. \n \n \"Come, lassie! Rest while I tell you the tale of the finding of The Red Knight. \n \n \"It will be forty years, come Maytime again, since I brought Kitty Belaire from the old East over the Valley of The Qu\u0027Appelle to The Craggs. Here we set up a home in the little log hut you can see at the end of the lane. In the log hut was born the first wee bairn. He did not stay with us long and we laid him away in the dip beyond the bluffs. There, too, Ned came to us, filling the sore spot in our hearts left by his little brother. We were happy, the three of us, though we had little to do with, and the work was hard. The years were years of struggle. We fought the winds and the drought, rust, smut, hail and the frost with little success to boast about. One year we had a bumper crop with prices low. Then followed one or two without a harvest. Ned was growing to be a husky little chap when a crop grew on the place that promised us a forty-bushel yield. But one day a black cloud swept over the homestead and in ten minutes it was gone. We had no seed. On the heels of the hail came a drought year. Following it appeared a crop that filled the settlement with hope. We were getting ready to cut when a blight appeared. The rust reduced the yield from forty bushels to five. So passed the years and the battle went against us, with the frost the worst enemy of all. One terrible harvest it came to me that the seed was wrong. It matured too slowly. What we needed was a seed that would come along fast enough to harden before the blight of the rust or the nip of frost. The following harvest I set out on a quest. One day I discovered a patch of ripe heads among the filling grain. Upon shelling them I found a plump kernel fully matured. I plucked the strange heads and carefully preserved the wheat. When seeding time came round again I sowed them on a bit of new ground in the garden. They came up strong and far outstripped the other grain. I had great hopes. Filling time arrived and I watched developments. It was now plain to me that the new variety would ripen fully two weeks ahead of the old type. Then, in the depths of night, a crashing hailstorm and—my precious plot smashed into the earth. \n \n \"I had made the fatal mistake of not preserving a few kernels against accident. But that was the beginning. Henceforth I was alert to discover any quickly maturing plants among my fields of grain. By hand selection I began to improve the standard varieties. By use of head-row plots I was able to provide myself with a purer seed. But it took a great deal of time. My neighbours began to surpass me in quantity of yield. Eventually they regarded me as luny. At last only Kitty and Ned believed in me. They never failed me. They became experts in seed selection. They helped me with their sympathy. Together we made thousands of tests. Gradually we caught our feet. One year we started cutting a full week ahead of the settlement. We had escaped the rust and showed a plump sample. We were alone in our good fortune. From that time we were the first into the binding, our yield was at the top, and under Ned\u0027s wise management our quantity began to pull ahead, always showing a consistently high sample. \n \n \"It is four years this harvest that Kitty and the lad went out on a \u0027roguing\u0027 stalk. Perhaps you do not know that a \u0027rogue\u0027 is a foreign variety of grain that has appeared for some reason in your field. The task of plucking these \u0027rogues\u0027 is called \u0027roguing.\u0027 Upon their return the mother handed to me a headed plant of wheat carefully lifted from the ground. How well I remember it! She gave it into my hands with a smile. \n \n \"\u0027Here, Edward!\u0027 she said brightly. \u0027Here is your Red Knight at last. I found him growing in the twenty acre field on the little knoll.\u0027 \n \n \"I took the plant and carefully examined it. The straw was strong and erect, the roots the most perfect I had ever looked upon. But it was the head that caught my eye, as it had caught Kitty\u0027s and Ned\u0027s. It was not exceptionally large but well compacted and heavy, its spikelets packed with wonderful kernels. We were not led into fond hopes by the remarkable heads, as we had tested many another apparently as perfect.\" \n \n Here the old man paused, lost a moment in reverie. \n \n \"That winter the Mother died,\" resumed he softly. \"But she left a legacy that will forever bless mankind. We carried out our tests. We have put The Red Knight through every conceivable trial and it remains pure, repeating its superior qualities each harvest. It is of the highest milling grade, grows a strong straw and erect, compact head, maturing three full weeks before any other wheat. This tub is filled from our head-row plots with the very purest Red Knight. In addition Ned has already cut and threshed a five acre field. The yield has been true to promise and will astonish the world. Red Knight, the gift to the world of Kitty Belaire, has averaged this year over one hundred bushels to the acre.\" \n \n As the old man finished a deep silence fell on them, broken at length by Mary. At the first accents of her voice her companion looked up. He was surprised to see tears in her eyes. \n \n \"Mr. Pullar!\" she said hesitantly, her voice touched with awe. \"You and Ned and—his mother are—gracious benefactors. You are bringing a wonderful boon to the West—to the whole world.\" \n \n Leaning forward the old man looked eagerly into the earnest eyes before him. \n \n \"Ah, lassie,\" he said kindly, \"you are a wonderful little soul. You are seeing deep into this thing, God bless you. \u0027Tis a vision the three of us have had. The Red Knight will mean a steady and reliable living for the farmers round about us and a sure crop for the struggling pioneer in the new places of the world. It will mean that a million homesteads will spring up in the great Northern plains where men could scarcely live because of the rust and frost. It will fill up the bread-basket of the world and make cheaper food for the hard-pressed masses, for The Red Knight will push the grain belt three hundred miles nearer to the poles the whole world round.\" \n \n \"Just a moment, Mr. Pullar!\" exclaimed Mary, seized by a brilliant idea. \"I\u0027ve got it! I believe every word you say. It is true. Gloriously true! But the world will have to hear about it. It will take time to marshall the forces of The Red Knight and start him on his great crusade. You will have to declare him to the world. The discovery and mission of this wonderful new wheat must be placed before the public, and at once.\" \n \n \"Ah,\" said he, \"you speak the truth. Ned and I have thought it over, but we have no gift of the pen whatever.\" \n \n Another deep silence fell over them. It was Mary who broke it once more. \n \n \"Do you think, Mr. Pullar,\" she said diffidently, \"that—that I could help you? I have done a little writing. We could get the facts into shape and some editor could put them in form for presentation to the public.\" \n \n The old man looked at her with eyes in which glowed a grateful wonder. \n \n \"You believe my story enough to do that, lassie?\" \n \n \"Why, of course! It is simply wonderful! Come over to the school each day at noon and we can work at the tale of The Red Knight while the children are playing. An hour a day will accomplish a great deal in a month. Will you come?\" \n \n Her companion reflected deeply before replying. \n \n \"It is a noble offer,\" he said gratefully. \"But I will think it over. If I decide it is best I will come to-morrow.\" \n \n \"Thank you, Mr. Pullar!\" was the pleased reply. \"This has been an amazing hour. But I must be going. You will be sure and come?\" \n \n Waving good-bye she vanished through the trees. \n \n For a long time the man reflected on the happy interview. At length he returned to the sack of unthreshed wheat. Picking up the flail he held it poised ready while his gaze grew pathetically reminiscent. \n \n \"Ah, Kitty,\" he whispered. \"\u0027Tis an angel she is. Our dreams will come true after all, dear heart.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1890/54549.html","bookId":792,"book":{"id":792,"title":"The Valley of Gold","description":"简介： The east wind blew furiously, beating gray sheets down the streaming panes.
