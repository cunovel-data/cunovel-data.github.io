{"id":38337,"no":5,"title":"V AT THE WATER-HOLE","content":"Easy Murphy shaded his eyes from the sun as he gazed eagerly over the prairie. After a prolonged look he remarked: \n \n \"Begobs, I belave he\u0027s coming!\" \n \n A further scanning of the landscape elicited a cry of satisfaction. \n \n \"Nick\u0027s headin\u0027 fer the howl all right,\" said he elatedly. \n \n The Irishman was standing on the tank, his hand on the pump-handle. He had backed the grays into a pool fed by a small creek that here expanded into a miniature pond some dozen yards across. In Western threshing the tankman draws his water from the nearest hole or stream. For some days both Easy and Nick Ford, the McClure tankman, had been filling their tanks at the same pool. \n \n Nick Ford was known familiarly as Boozey Ford, a self-explanatory sobriquet. Whiskey aside, he was one of the most reliable tankers along the Valley. With whiskey by his side his water-wagon was apt to receive a diluted attention. \n \n As the days sped by the struggle between the two outfits became intense. The two tankmen were nearing the point of interpersonal complications in their heated conversations on the issue. Easy Murphy was feeling irrepressibly loquacious on this occasion, for he had not met Boozey since the affair of the R-M wrench. However, as Nick drove up he began a foxy approach, greeting him in a friendly manner. \n \n \"Nick! How is the wur-r-rld using you?\" was his opening. \n \n \"So, so!\" was Nick\u0027s no less friendly response. \n \n \"Ye\u0027ll be afthurr faylin\u0027 a demi-semi-quaver in yer boots, Nick, since till-night\u0027s the night the Valley Outfit take the candy from the kid.\" \n \n \"There\u0027s sure going to be a lark to-night,\" agreed Nick. \"We\u0027ll have a howling time putting the kibosh on your little, old Outfit. You mark my words, Murphy, when Jack Butte hands out his estimates you\u0027ll freeze stiff. I\u0027ll bet you even money we lick you by a thousand.\" \n \n \"Just cover that wee trifle,\" said Easy, revealing a ten-dollar bill. \n \n \"Sorry to rob you, Murphy,\" said Nick, \"but it\u0027s awfully decent of you to accommodate me. We\u0027ll hand it to Butte just before the curtain goes up.\" \n \n \"\u0027Tis a great pleasure till contribute,\" agreed Easy light-heartedly. Then he added slyly, \"By the way, Nick, did ye miss anny tools from yer tool-chist lately?\" \n \n \"Not that I know of,\" was the frank reply. \n \n \"Shure we found wan uv Rob McClure\u0027s wrenches in our separator yisturr-day.\" \n \n Nick\u0027s interest perceptibly increased. \n \n \"\u0027Tis not the act uv a gintleman, but a dirty trick uv Snoopy Bill Baird, and \u0027tis achin\u0027 I am till spile the impudint jaw of the Snoopy wan fer the same foul act.\" \n \n Nick\u0027s blood began to sweep into his animated face. But the other continued: \n \n \"Howld yer timper, lad. I\u0027m not afthurr blamin\u0027 you, Nick. Yer as innocent as the lambs in the spring.\" \n \n His voice grew sweet as honey and he made a suspicious motion to his breast pocket. \n \n \"We\u0027ll just have a wee dthrop as gintlemen together on the head uv the divilmint, and part—frinds.\" \n \n He drew an amber-coloured flask from his pocket. \n \n \"\u0027Tis the rale Irish, Nick. Be afthurr washin\u0027 down a swate swallow.\" \n \n He extended the bottle convivially. \n \n Nick took in the sight with fascinated and thirsty eyes. All hostility magically vanished and a supreme joy capered shamelessly into his face. \n \n \"Don\u0027t care if I do,\" said he, with a too casual unconcern. \"Dad, that\u0027s prime stuff!\" was his genuine approval as he handed back the flask. \n \n \"Shure I\u0027m afthurr sayin\u0027 the same mesilf. Yer over modest, lad. Take a sip that wull tingle the toes uv ye.\" \n \n So gracious a pressure was not to be resisted, and Nick responded with a ready acquiescence that left nothing to be desired. Easy emulated in pantomime, tipping the flask adroitly but permitting no drop to pass his lips. Taking another \"sensation,\" Nick scurried off to his own tank and began pumping vigorously. Soon, however, he felt the desire for still another touch and was back at the flask. Easy Murphy kept the bottle supplied from some mysterious source about his person. So the best part of an hour passed and signs began to appear that Nick was rivalling the tanks in the quantity of liquid he was carrying. In the meantime Easy had leisurely filled his own tank. Suddenly The Mogul, McClure\u0027s giant engine, sounded the water call. Nick recognized the signal and, dropping the pump-handle, seized the lines and started off, urging his amazed horses in a line of patter that was new to them. As he drove away Easy slipped down off his own wagon and, stealing craftily after, tapped the bung of Nick\u0027s tank with a stone. One or two skillful knocks and the peg fell out, letting the water away in a heavy gush. Throwing the bung into the grass, Easy climbed up on his tank and followed. \n \n Ahead drove Nick, supremely unconscious of the fact that his tank was fast emptying. When they reached the road-allowance he became suddenly confused. His trail lay directly across the road and into a field. His horses would have taken the right way, but Nick pulled them up sharply. His eyesight was temporarily impaired. He could see only the good road running east and west. Pulling on the left line, he turned into the east. Yet he was not sure, and drew up his horses once more. His tongue was thick as he called back: \n \n \"Hello, Eashy! (hic) Ish the trail (hic) all right?\" \n \n \"Shure and indade it is that,\" came the wily response. \"Go right ahead to yer outfit, Nick, man. It\u0027s a foine road, the smoothest in the howl counthry.\" \n \n With a flourish of his whip Nick sent the unwilling team on down the road. Crossing the road-allowance, Easy entered the oat-field through the wire fence and made straight for his own machine. As he hit the stubble trail he heard the Mogul whistle impatiently for water. A moment later she called again. Turning around, he looked at Nick. He, too, had heard the urgent calls and was standing up driving like Jehu. The tank was now empty and the horses responded by breaking into a smart trot. The sight was hugely entertaining to the watcher. He slapped his thigh, shouting in unholy glee. \n \n \"Be the wake uv me grandmother!\" he cried exultingly, \"it\u0027s now we get back the swate and precious minutes they filched by their rascalities uv yisterday.\" \n \n Away in the distance Nick was driving like mad while the Mogul tattooed her calls for water with an angry insistence that drove him from her at accelerated speed. The circumstance was too much for the delighted Irishman. Laughing till the tears rolled down his cheeks he called after the disappearing Nick: \n \n \"Go it, me hearty! Kape it up, bye, and ye\u0027ll soon reach the broad Atlantic. Begobs! Call in at Winnipeg. They\u0027re shy on water-wagons in the Gateway uv the Gowlden Wist.\" \n \n Never a word of the matter did he give to his young boss as he emptied his tank in preparation for the next trip. His wickedly radiant face attracted Ned, however, stirring his curiosity. \n \n \"What\u0027s tickling you, Easy? Been filling your boiler at Louie\u0027s tank?\" \n \n \"Niver the dthrop, Ned. Not wanct since the twilfth uv July have I shined up till the dementin\u0027 crathur. \u0027Tis the whistle uv the Mogul that\u0027s drivin\u0027 me tipsy. Somehow the thirsty screamin\u0027 uv it tickles me since uv the rediculous.\" \n \n \"Rob\u0027s engine is out of water. She\u0027s been callin\u0027 for over half an hour,\" observed Ned, looking over the stubble at the rival outfit. \"Indeed, Easy, she\u0027s hung up. Their blower is stopped.\" \n \n At an unusual hearty chuckle from the tankman, Ned eyed him sharply, a suspicion leaping into his mind. \n \n \"Shtopped\u0027s the wurrd!\" exclaimed Easy in feigned surprise, shading his eyes the better to study the Mogul. \"Rob wull be afthurr havin\u0027 a brathin\u0027 spell. May it last a wake.\" \n \n Ned\u0027s eyes detected an unusual excitement on his companion\u0027s averted face. His suspicion took a sudden definite form. \n \n \"Easy,\" said he seriously, \"you are mighty pleased about something and yet not at all surprised. Let me into the secret.\" \n \n \"Shure \u0027tis plazed I am this minute, Ned, and the most astonished critter on the Valley Gang.\" \n \n \"Steady, lad,\" cautioned Ned. \"You can\u0027t fool me. You know more about the water shortage at Rob\u0027s outfit than Rob himself. What\u0027s keeping Nick?\" \n \n Easy found a matter for precipitate occupation in the barrel he was filling and did not reply at once. He was seized with sudden panic, for he had caught sight of Ned\u0027s face. The unsmiling eyes filled him with trepidation. When he at length looked up Ned\u0027s clear eyes looked through him. For once the garrulous Irishman was speechless while a blush flamed slowly over his brown face. \n \n \"Tell me,\" said Ned simply. \n \n Hitching his overalls nervously and somewhat forcefully, Easy let a broad, sheepish grin play on his ample face. He attempted jocularity. \n \n \"\u0027Tis a lugoobrius confession ye\u0027ll be draggin\u0027 out uv me wid the third degree uv yer blazin\u0027 eye.\" \n \n \"Tell me,\" repeated Ned. \n \n \"Wull,\" said Easy, scratching his head with obvious regret, \"since \u0027tis implacabul ye are, I\u0027ll make it short and swate. Nick and yer humble sarvint meets at the mud puddle. We pass the complimints uv the sayson, git intill a small fracas uv the tongue and out uv it by the bottle. We had a wee dthrop. That is, Nick had. Thin he took another and another, et cetra and so on. Nick was oncommon thirsty. In a wurrd, I filled Nick till the neck and pulled the bung uv his tank. The one is impty and the other full. \u0027Tis the Mogul and mesilf knows which and,—yersilf, begobs, since ye tapped me wires. To sum up fer ye, me inquisitive frind, Rob\u0027s tank is impty and his tankman full, and the pair uv thim is headin\u0027 fer salt water at a spankin\u0027 trot. \u0027Tis comin\u0027 till the blackgards if ye ask Easy Murphy.\" \n \n Easy stood before his boss with hanging head. His confession had not stimulated any risible emotions in Ned. Ned, on his part, said nothing, but stood looking for a little at the culprit, a kindly light mingling with the flash of his eyes. Then he stepped over to his engine and, seizing the whistle-cord, gave it a jerk, blowing the one sharp shriek that signals stop. Instantly the work ceased and the outfit slowed to rest. Amid the shouts of the men demanding the cause of the stop, Easy Murphy ran swiftly to Ned. \n \n \"Ye\u0027re not afthurr killin\u0027 the outfit,\" cried he, a peculiar pleading in his voice. \n \n \"Easy,\" said Ned quietly, \"the Valley Outfit is running this little jig on the square. Not a wheel turns on this mill until McClure makes up every minute we\u0027ve killed for him.\" \n \n The Irishman looked into Ned\u0027s face. There had been the glimmer of an accusing look but it was gone. In its place was something big and honest that hushed the angry protest about to leap forth. Their eyes held for a moment, then the tankman\u0027s fell while the flush swept his face once again. \n \n \"I\u0027ll explain to the boys,\" said Ned, moving away toward the separator. \n \n \"No, lad,\" cried Easy, impulsively seizing his arm. \"\u0027Tis the hot curse I was nearly givin\u0027 ye. Ye\u0027re too white, Ned, fer a divil the loikes uv wan Easy Murphy. Shure \u0027tis right ye are, though I\u0027m hatin\u0027 the idea. I\u0027ll hike till the mill and make me diplomatical defince before the gang. Sind me carcas till Belfast whin the boys git through wid ut.\" \n \n Making a comical grimace, he set off to the separator to do the hardest thing he had ever attempted. \n \n The men listened silently while Easy made his brief and self-accusative explanation. At the abrupt conclusion there resulted a most awkward pause. The gang were dumb at the unexpectedness of it. Each man was torn by several desires. He wanted to laugh, to howl, in fact. But something fine in him rendered him mute. There was a great admiration for their game boss and an even greater admiration for their game and artful culprit. The embarrassment had about reached the explosive point when Jean Benoit let out a scream. \n \n \"Ze res\u0027 do moche good, I tink,\" said he, shaking with laughter. \"Wan, two, tree cheer on de boss an\u0027 dees ver bad Irish fellow.\" \n \n At his words there broke out a jolly shout while the gang lay back on the straw and laughed to their heart\u0027s content. \n \n Through the long wait there was not a murmur. \n \n Meanwhile in McClure\u0027s gang consternation reigned. The last drop of water had been sucked up by the inspirator and the water was sinking in the glass. The men were perched on all vantage points on the lookout for the delinquent. No sign of him could they discover. \n \n \"Get Smithers to haul these barrels filled at the slough,\" directed McClure to Snoopy Bill, pointing to the barrels about the engine. \"They\u0027ll keep her going until I can find that blankety Nick.\" \n \n McClure had barely set off on his quest when one of the teamsters called the attention of the gang to the sudden \"hang-up\" of the Valley machine. As an hour passed and there was no sign of the Valley men resuming work, Snoopy Bill and his companions grew jubilant to a degree. \n \n Nearly two hours later McClure appeared riding the tank and towing his buggy, in which lay the inebriate tanker. \n \n A few minutes after, the Mogul was driving ahead under full pressure, joined shortly by the distant hum of the Valley Gang. Into the dark they raged, fighting ahead until eight, when the defiant whistles of the rival engines told that the great run was over. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1890/54544.html","bookId":792,"book":{"id":792,"title":"The Valley of Gold","description":"简介： The east wind blew furiously, beating gray sheets down the streaming panes.
