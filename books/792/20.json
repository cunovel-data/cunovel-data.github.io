{"id":38352,"no":20,"title":"XX A FAWN AT BAY","content":"The following afternoon Mary McClure sat pensively at her piano, her spirit awander in the dulcet shadowlands of an improviso. She was pondering a remarkable thing. At that moment her parents were out for a jaunt in the Valley, the first in years. She recalled the pleasure lighting her mother\u0027s face as she accepted the unique proposal. Hope of happier relations had stirred in her breast. For all the bright little circumstance there was a query in Mary\u0027s mind that drew minor strains from the plaintive piano. \n \n It was some weeks since she had seen Ned Pullar. They had then agreed to terminate their covert meetings, hoping for a turn in the wheel of fate that would be auspicious. She was deeply troubled over rumours that hinted embarrassment for Ned and his father. She had not learned the true facts but had drawn shrewd deductions from the reports of Mrs. Grundy. Lately a fear had obsessed her. She tried to banish the thought in view of the glad incident of the afternoon, but those minor vagaries would persist in stealing from her fingers. \n \n A chat with Margaret Grant had informed her of the presence of the stranger Foyle as inimical to Ned. The old homestead was in some way involved. Shortly after her chat with Margaret she had observed her father in friendly conversation with Foyle before the office of Chesley Sykes. At the sight a shadow had flitted through her mind. Was her father involved in Ned\u0027s trouble? \n \n She had abandoned herself to a sombre brooding upon this disquieting theme when a knock sounded upon the door. It startled her, for she was alone. Lifting her hands from the keys, she went to the door. On opening she was confronted with the great figure of Chesley Sykes. A smile lit his handsome face. Touching his hat with graceful courtesy, he greeted her respectfully. \n \n \"Good-day, Miss McClure!\" was his quiet salute. \n \n At the sound of his voice the episode at the door flashed into her mind. She regretted the absence of her parents. \n \n Hospitality forbade rudeness and she invited him within. \n \n \"I have come to see you, yourself,\" said he, smiling at her formality. \"I am heartily glad there is nobody else about. I have been anxious to crave your pardon for my part in the incident at the door. It was inexcusable and foolish, I acknowledge. I am sorry.\" \n \n The girl looked away with serious face. Instinct warned her against the man, but his tone and manner were agreeably penitent. She believed him. \n \n \"I do not hold grudges, Mr. Sykes,\" was her reply. \"I remember the matter well and I am glad to forget it, since you desire it.\" \n \n \"That relieves me,\" was the pleased reply. \"I promise to observe the good old conventions in the future. There was something extenuating, had you known it. Have you no suspicion of what a real fact lay behind that silly act? Of that fact I am not ashamed.\" \n \n Mary offered no surmise and moved to the window, where she became absorbed in the world without. \n \n \"I want to talk some things over to-day,\" said he frankly, moving to her side. \"This is probably the last time I shall solicit your forbearance. I am leaving Pellawa. \n \n \"You know of the college years and the unswerving interest a certain student at law took in a certain small co-ed. That interest had deepened during these days in Pellawa. You and you alone, Mary McClure, are the reason for my presence here. I have been chasing the gleam. I have been bitterly disappointed. The rustic life has not drawn us any nearer. And yet—I—I have not thrown up the sponge. I am not resigning you, Mary. That is my purpose here to-day. I want to let you know this. I have only one objective, only one dream in the alluring puzzle called life, and that is, Mary McClure. My single ambition is to win you for my wife. Some day, Mary, will you marry me?\" \n \n The girl turned toward him, astounded at his impudence, a flush rising in her cheeks. At sight of him she could not doubt his sincerity. \n \n \"Mr. Sykes,\" she said quickly, \"you have no right to make such an approach to me.\" \n \n \"Only the right of a mighty big regard that keeps on growing without any especial attention from the most desirable quarter.\" \n \n She remained silent a moment, suddenly reflective. \n \n \"Perhaps you are right,\" she said thoughtfully. \"If you are, you already know my answer. I can never become the wife of Chesley Sykes. Never.\" \n \n Her manner was so emphatic, so deliberate, that the confidence of the man received a jolt. He heard the ring of steel on steel and looked in wonder at the dainty antagonist. \n \n \"I am sure you will not approach me again,\" said she in a manner he realized was imperative. Then she smiled. \"You are Daddy\u0027s friend,\" said she, with a pleasant courtesy. \"I will not forget that.\" \n \n There followed a long silence. At length she looked up. His face was a surprise to her. There was no vexation, no displeasure. Instead, the passion of the man expressed itself in a great friendliness. There was something else that disturbed her. It was a confidence, an assurance, a determination not to be denied. \n \n With a shrug of his shoulders he seemed to throw off the gloom that attended his defeat and, smiling ingenuously, said: \n \n \"Play for me that sweet thing you were dreaming over when I broke up your paradise.\" \n \n She shook her head. \n \n \"No,\" was her quiet refusal. \"I cannot. My mood is not musical any longer. I hear Father\u0027s bells. He will be better able to entertain you.\" \n \n \"Sorry you cannot draw to me to-day,\" said he regretfully, taking up his hat. \"But your mood will change. Some day you will take a delight in delighting me. I, myself, am not now in a frame of mind to be companionable. It is better that I return to Pellawa. Give my regards to your parents. And remember,\" enjoined he with peculiar emphasis, \"remember that I am still on the trail of my distracting little Will-o\u0027-the-wisp.\" \n \n Sykes had gone but a few minutes when Helen McClure entered. Her face was flushed and unhappy. Gathering Mary into her arms, she kissed her with impulsive tenderness. \n \n \"Whatever happens, darling,\" she whispered hurriedly, \"follow your heart. The happiness of us all depends upon it, though it may seem otherwise.\" \n \n \"Mother!\" said the girl, excitement welling up in her eyes. \"How troubled you are! What is it?\" \n \n \"I am a little anxious for you,\" said the mother, disengaging herself gently from Mary\u0027s clasp. \"Your father has been talking to me of your prospects. He wishes to see you in the office. He is coming now. If you follow your heart all will some day be well.\" \n \n With the words she bestowed upon Mary a clinging caress. \n \n The girl walked hesitantly to the office and stood looking out of the window as she awaited her father. She was threatened with panic but grew composed as she heard his footsteps in the hall. She turned as he entered and lifted her head, meeting his great eyes with the clear gaze of her own. He, too, was steeling himself to the interview. His unsmiling face distressed her. Passing by her, he seated himself in his office chair and whirled about. Before he could look up to where she stood he was surprised to feel the touch of her hands upon his head. Enfolding him in her arms, she kissed his brow. A thrill swept over him. For an instant he looked with the inner eye upon his own soul. He knew it to be unnatural, brutal. \n \n \"Daddy!\" she whispered. \"Let me tell you all before you speak.\" \n \n Gently, but with a steady, rigid motion of his hands, he pressed her back. The tenderness that had betrayed him for but an instant vanished. \n \n \"We\u0027ll see about that in a moment,\" was the cold reply. \"I want to ask you a few questions before you tell your story. Sykes tells me he had a talk with you this afternoon.\" \n \n \"A diplomatic conversation,\" corrected Mary, with a faint smile. \n \n \"What did he say?\" \n \n \"A great deal. It was not, after all, very much of a conversation. It was a declaration. I almost fancied he was issuing a veiled ultimatum. He did, however, ask me a pointed question and I gave him a blunt reply.\" \n \n \"You refused him?\" \n \n \"Yes.\" \n \n \"Do you know Sykes?\" \n \n \"Too wisely and too well. His father is a wealthy broker; his mother a delightful aristocrat and a very fashionable lady. They live in a dreamland on The Crescent shut in with exclusive hedges amid the bloom of wonderful flowers. Their well-trimmed terraces run down to the water\u0027s edge. Sykes is a fellow-student of some years\u0027 duration. He has seemed to take rather more than a mild interest in the lone hope of the McClures. But I do not like him, Dad. I like Ned.\" \n \n \"So they tell me.\" \n \n \"I love Ned, Dad,\" was the gentle confession. \n \n \"But Sykes is a gentleman,\" said McClure testily. \n \n \"Ned is a man. I love a man, a real man, Dad.\" \n \n McClure rose to his feet, the old passion rising afresh. \n \n \"I cannot agree with you. A man would not sneak into the bluffs to be alone with the girl he respects.\" \n \n The stroke drew blood. A flush swept over the sensitive face. \n \n \"I did meet Ned once alone by accident,\" was the admission. \"At all other times Margaret Grant joined us. We have not had even these interviews for weeks.\" \n \n \"How long have you been encouraging Pullar?\" \n \n \"Ned and I became intimate in our first year at the University.\" \n \n \"Why did you not tell me?\" \n \n The girl looked pleadingly into the eyes that grew each moment more chill. She halted in her reply, irresolute and deeply troubled. Had she the courage to drag the family skeleton into the light? She dropped her eyes and pondered. When she lifted them they were wet with tears. \n \n \"Come!\" was the brusque command. \"Tell me why you and Pullar skulk about the ravines like a pair of coyotes.\" \n \n \"The reason I have not confided in you, Father,\" said the girl slowly, \"is because of your strange enmity for Ned. That, however, would not have been a sufficient reason had it not been for the cruel thing that has robbed Mother and me of our husband and Daddy. You have become a stranger to us. We do not tell these dear tales to—strangers. I could love you, Father, if you did not trample our hearts with your cruel heels.\" \n \n At her words McClure shrank back. He scarcely believed his ears. Yet it was little Mary who stood before him self-possessed and unafraid, smiting his conscience with her gentle voice. Her eyes were imploring and beautiful, with a yearning he could not face. With an impatient shrug he turned away. \n \n \"What would we have gained,\" continued the girl, \"had I told you of my intimacy with the man you hate? It would have resulted in only deeper misery for our home. It is cruel of me to talk like this, but it is the truth. Mother suffers continuous anguish, hiding it from us as only her wonderful love can devise. This is my only reason for loving Ned in secret. We are not afraid to let the world know of it. It already knows. As you well know, Ned fears nothing, not even the anger of Rob McClure.\" \n \n The sight of the girl with her earnest eyes and tremulous lips touched the buried ruth of the man. At her frank arraignment he felt the stirrings of a compunction that was new. Her piteous helplessness held off from him by his own chill unrelenting pierced him to a depth she little dreamed. The memory of her suppliant figure haunted him through the after years. \n \n But he resisted. A sudden bracing of the unyielding will stiffened his wavering resolution. As is usual when a man stifles the inner voice, Rob McClure swung instantly to the opposite extreme. \"Here,\" he mused, \"is this daughter of mine, browbeating me rather than giving me dutiful obedience.\" He was about to lash her with scandalous insinuation when the ulterior object recurred to him. He forthwith tempered his rage with a wise craftiness. \n \n \"You have given a strange reason,\" said he judicially. \"I will not give my consent to your friendship with such a hound. Why not consider a red-blooded man like Chesley Sykes? He is intelligent, educated, wealthy and delightfully congenial. In addition, he is your father\u0027s close friend. Never before have I used my authority. But now I forbid you to have anything to do with Pullar. Turn your attention to something that offers you a future.\" \n \n \"You mean that I must break my engagement with Ned?\" \n \n \"I do,\" was the adamant response. \n \n At the brutal tone a swift change came over the girl. While an infinite suffering looked out of her eyes she stood erect and proud. \n \n \"Do you also command that I shall accept Chesley Sykes in Ned\u0027s place?\" \n \n Her voice had the ring that had shaken the confidence of Sykes but a short time before. He felt the danger in it and tempered his reply. \n \n \"No, Mary! I don\u0027t command. I urge you.\" \n \n \"But you have as much right to command me to marry Chesley Sykes as you have to forbid my friendship with Ned Pullar. Why not, then?\" \n \n McClure paused a moment, calculating her intention. \n \n \"I have the right to do either,\" was the triumphant reply. There was a threat in his voice. \n \n The girl looked at him a moment, her face aquiver with pain. The anguish of her emotion blanched cheeks and lips. She addressed him in a voice strange for its quality of renunciation. \n \n \"Father,\" said she, \"your words are terrible to me. They mean that you would deprive me of your affection—of my home. You have not the right to command me to do a wrong. That is not the prerogative of even a parent. As for Chesley Sykes, I abhor him as unscrupulous and cruel. The more I know of him the less I can discover to admire. I will never marry him. On the other hand, some day I shall marry Ned. You misunderstand him. He is not your enemy. He would be a real friend. I shall be forced to disobey you, Father.\" \n \n Reluctantly the girl turned away and walked to the door. \n \n McClure was the victim of an overwhelming rage. Never had he been so stoutly withstood. It galled him to know that his daughter was right. In logic of brain and ethics she had worsted him. He was eager for savage retort, but the offer of Sykes dangled before him like golden fruit. The venom of his rage would destroy it. So he was cunning and remained silent. \n \n \"Just a moment, Mary,\" said he in a conciliatory voice. \n \n She turned eagerly toward him. \n \n \"I would not force you to do anything you do not wish to do,\" said he. \"But do not be rash. Think it all over carefully. Your home is here. It will always be so. Perhaps after a time you will be able to meet my wishes.\" \n \n Bitterly disappointed, the girl turned away. She was also surprised. Her father, though beyond doubt in a violent rage, had acquiesced to her will. Amid all the turmoil of her distress she recalled the nonchalance of Chesley Sykes as she refused his proposal. As with him, her father seemed not so greatly disappointed. As she pondered the enigma a thought flitted into her mind that caused a cold chill to clutch at her heart. \n \n Without a reply she passed through the door. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1890/54559.html","bookId":792,"book":{"id":792,"title":"The Valley of Gold","description":"简介： The east wind blew furiously, beating gray sheets down the streaming panes.
