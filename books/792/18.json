{"id":38350,"no":18,"title":"XVIII THE BIRD OF THE COULEE","content":"There is life on the road—a rush into the April shine; muffled clatter of galloping hoofs; the rhythmic sway of a girlish form to the drum and flute of flying feet and carolling lips. Youth and beauty in the saddle of spring! Mary McClure was enjoying the leisure of the open trail and halted Bobs on the floor of a coulee, a narrow, stream-like depression with abrupt banks. It was a pretty green dip zigzagging out of sight into east and west, and lined on either bank with rounded clumps of willow. There were gleams of a tiny creek. From the willows near her came the soft twitter of nesting birds. Restraining the impatient Bobs, she strove to discern the sweet singers. The cries were familiar—all but one. It was a strange little call with a plaintive, human-like wail and a ventriloquistic quality that led one to think it came from far away. She was positive it was the cry of some rare bird hidden in the leaves. Swinging Bobs she trotted close to the trees. The birds, alarmed, took flight down the coulee. She followed cautiously and listened again, delighted at length to distinguish the voice of the feathered stranger. A sudden impulsive advance of Bobs, who essayed to crop a mouthful of leaves, put the birds to flight once more. They doubled back in a cloud of whirring wings. She was about to follow when the cry of the strange bird came again out of the tree before her. It alone had remained. She searched the tree, but no sign could she discover of the mysterious creature. Concluding at length that the sound came from a more distant clump, she rode further into the east. The sound now seemed much nearer. Tree after tree was passed, with the strangely recurring result of a growing clearness. She was deeply puzzled and intensely curious as to the enigma. Finally she reached the end of the bluff and still she could hear the call coming with an undoubted increase of volume. Pondering the circumstance she suddenly concluded that her bird was a weird illusion. \"Bobs!\" she cried perplexedly, \"our bird is not a bird. It is a disembodied voice.\" Then as the cry broke clearly from a distance, she said in alarm: \"It is a human voice, Bobs. Somebody is in distress far down the coulee. Let us listen carefully. No champing of that bit, please.\" The voice came again. It was indeed a human cry, smothered in some inexplicable way. The tone was one of plaintive terror. Urging the horse ahead, she cantered along the creek. Rounding a bend, she realized that the sound came from some point very near. Rising in her stirrups, she searched the coulee. The only unusual object that met her eye was the carcass of a horse. It lay in a sharp curve of the north bank close in. The noise was emanating from the vicinity of the dead animal. Riding toward it, she was thrilled to catch sight of a bit of red clothing. \"Bobs, Bobs! What a terrible thing!\" was her horrified cry as she leaped to the ground beside the horse. Crowded into a hole between the horse and the bank lay the figure of a little boy, scarcely five years of age. He was stretched upon the ground with his small body half twisted into the bank. His bare limbs, right arm and left leg, were clutched in the steel fangs of a brace of great wolf traps. The dead horse had been used as a bait by some trapper who had set his traps between the horse and bank, at head and feet, in order to catch his wolf as it sought the entrails. Instead they had caught the curious child. Both limbs were torn and bloody from the grip of the biting steel as the boy twisted under the torture. His cry for help had been muffled by the encroaching bank. The little fellow moaned for release as he caught sight of the girl. Looking up with wild, dazed eyes he cried: \"Take me, Mummie! Take me away!\" \"You poor laddie!\" comforted the girl. \"I will help you, darling. You will be out in a minute. Do just what I say.\" The sight of the small unfortunate made a powerful appeal to the sympathies. The little face was streaked with the pitiable wash of tears. The child could scarcely see. At a glance she saw that he was near collapse. She acted swiftly. Placing her foot upon the spring of the trap imprisoning the leg, she rested her whole weight upon it and it sank. With a quick motion of her deft fingers she opened the jaws and took out the limb. A moment later the arm, too, was free. Released, the little form rolled upon its back and lay helpless. Stooping she picked him up gently and carried him to the bank of the creek, laying him upon the grass. \"Lie here quiet, laddie,\" she enjoined in a soothing voice, \"and I\u0027ll ride back to the village for a carriage. I\u0027ll be back in a few minutes.\" But the child clung to her crying fearfully: \"Take me! Take me! Brubbie afraid!\" Kneeling beside him she gathered the small bundle into her arms. \"I will not leave you, darling,\" she soothed, hushing his fears. \"I will take you with me. Bobs will have to be a very gentle stretcher bearer. You must trust me, little one, and be careful to obey me. Bobs will carry us back. But first I must cover these poor torn limbs.\" Producing clean bandages, with the resource of a former occasion, she wrapped the wounds securely from air and dirt. Then she placed the boy upon Bobs\u0027 neck while the intelligent brute stood motionless, obedient to her low voiced commands. Climbing carefully into the saddle she took the child in her arms and guiding Bobs by voice and knee, rode back along the coulee. The child slept almost instantly, lulled by the gentle pace of the horse and endearing cooings of the girl. Aware that the surgeon\u0027s skill was urgently needed, she made her way to the doctor\u0027s office. He discovered her approach and running out to the curb relieved her of her burden. In a few words she informed him of her discovery of the boy and his misfortune. \"Will you come in?\" said he. \"You have done wonderfully and can help me with this operation. There is no nurse in the village just now.\" \"Gladly, if I can be of service,\" was the quick reply. \"Rest assured you can. With your assistance I shall be able to avoid the an?sthetic, though these wounds are a ragged mess. The poor little kid must have lain in those traps for hours. Pierre Leduc set them out for wolves. These curious little busybodies fall into surprising adventures. Brubbie will not forget this day for the rest of his life.\" Swiftly the doctor performed his work, cleaning the frayed lacerations and stitching with nimble address, while Mary beguiled the boy from his pain by the charm of her caress and the soothing touch of her woman\u0027s hand. \"There now, Brubbie!\" said the doctor at length. \"You are fit. Come, we\u0027ll take you to your mother. Miss McClure had better come along and take charge of this most difficult phase of the operation. Will you, Miss McClure?\" \"Still at your service, Doctor. But who is Brubbie, as you call him?\" \"Brubbie? Why, Brubbie is the young scamp of Pellawa, general town favourite and Nick Ford\u0027s baby. Brubbie is an incorrigible little vagrant. I\u0027ll warrant his mother hasn\u0027t even missed him. This will be some shock to her.\" It was a very startled and white-faced woman who gathered the small form to her breast. \"Mummie, Mummie!\" was the penitent cry. \"Brubbie run away. He step on traps and dey bite him. Brubbie think he will die and cry, cry, cry. But the leddy come and take Brubbie out of the traps and bring him home on the nice horse. Oo, oo!\" He encircled the woman\u0027s neck with a strangling hug. Mary smiled, relieved that the explanation had been made. \"Brubbie has given you all the facts, Mrs. Ford,\" corroborated she. \"I heard the cry of a strange bird in the coulee and followed it. The bird turned out to be Brubbie. Bobs carried him to the doctor here, who has fixed him up splendidly. He will soon be around again.\" The mother was dumb. For some minutes she could only nestle the child to her breast. Suddenly, as she thought upon the circumstance, a shudder swept her. A gruesome possibility had occurred to her. \"What would have happened to my baby if you had not heard him crying, Miss McClure? To-night the wolves would have come. God bless you for this.\" The woman\u0027s eyes filled with tears. Under the impulse of her natural gratitude she seized the girl\u0027s hand and kissed it reverently. \"You saved Brubbie! You saved him! You saved him!\" she cried again and again, in a quiet, grateful voice. \"Nick will thank you with all his heart. Cod bless you!\" As Mary passed through the coulee on her way home, she pulled Bobs again and listened to the birds afresh. This time the strange call was missing and a serious look crept into the girl\u0027s eyes as she thought upon it. \"Little birds!\" she whispered. \"Happy little birds! Your sweet singing saved a dear little life to-day.\" The happiest musings attended her as she let Bobs follow the trail of his own sweet will. The mission of the birds was not yet ended.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1890/54557.html","bookId":792,"book":{"id":792,"title":"The Valley of Gold","description":"简介： The east wind blew furiously, beating gray sheets down the streaming panes.
