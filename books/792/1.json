{"id":38333,"no":1,"title":"I HEAVY ODDS","content":"The east wind blew furiously, beating gray sheets down the streaming panes. Along the village street flowed a turbid torrent, the squalid wash of an \"old-timer-three-days\u0027-blow\" from the Great Lakes. Threshing was hung up. Every wheel was stopped for a thousand miles across the prairies. \n \n Sparrow\u0027s pool-room was a cavern of smoke. Through the blue-ringed mists of tobacco moved the unkempt silhouettes of boisterous threshermen. Suddenly over the hubbub rose a jeering cry. \n \n Ned Pullar leaned down and knocked the ashes out of his briar. His immobile face gave no sign that the cry was an insulting challenge. Opening his knife he slowly scooped out the bowl of his pipe. Tapping the inverted briar on the palm of his hand, he proceeded leisurely to fill in the tobacco. This act duly completed, he turned about and looked McClure in the face. In his eyes was a faint twinkle, but he elected to hold his tongue. His deliberate silence provoked his tormentor. Hitherto McClure had addressed him in a low tone. Now his great voice rose above the chatter of the players and the noise of the crashing balls. \n \n \"Come, Pullar!\" he sneered. \"You\u0027re yellow. How about odds?\" \n \n Play ceased and all eyes turned on the two men. \n \n \"Pull easy, Rob!\" adjured some partisan of McClure\u0027s. \"He\u0027s soft in the mouth.\" \n \n The crowd raised applauding guffaws. \n \n \"Naw, it\u0027s the blind staggers, pards,\" cried a smooth voice. \"Watch his blinkers.\" \n \n The immoderate laugh of the crowd had a curiously menacing note. \n \n Pullar\u0027s blinkers were not blinking, however. He held McClure\u0027s eyes with a level glance. \n \n Thrusting hands to hips akimbo McClure cried insolently: \n \n \"S-s-stumped! You quitter!\" \n \n Pullar was still silent. His clear eye was taking in the situation. McClure was plainly bent on baiting him and his purpose was beginning to dawn on the Valley boss. A quick survey of the room discovered to him the presence of nine of McClure\u0027s men. He could see them moving about into position to cut off all egress from the one door. Not a man of his own gang was in sight and the two or three outsiders were not promising allies. The stench of liquor and the savage flashing of wild eyes warned him of their fell intention. In the swift process of his thought he realized that they were about to pull him down and \"jump\" him with the unspeakable savagery of drunken fools. He was trapped. With every sense alert he went ahead imperturbably preparing to light up. \n \n Drawing a wad of bills from his pocket McClure thrust them under Pullar\u0027s nose. \n \n \"Five hundred bucks!\" he challenged. \"Five hundred little bucks to lay against you two to one that we can lick the Valley Outfit in a thirty day run any old time you want to take it on. No time like the present, Pullar!\" \n \n Ned Pullar stood straight and immense, a muscular figure in overalls and smock. His fresh, youthful face looked almost innocently from under the peak of his cap. His eyes were serious for an instant, then released an amused smile. \n \n \"Rob McClure!\" he said quietly. \"You are developing an interesting humour. Three times to-day you have flaunted this trifling wager in my face. It means nothing to me—nothing more than do you yourself, Robbie, mon, or your engaging gang.\" \n \n The mocking tone provoked a swift change in McClure. His eyes narrowed to slits that gleamed evilly. The rush of passion rendered him impotently mute. Backing their boss with yells of rage the gang moved menacingly toward the speaker. Suddenly above the foul oaths rang out a voice. It was one of the outsiders who had slipped unnoticed to the door. With his hand on the knob he called out: \n \n \"Hold \u0027em, Ned. I\u0027ll fetch the Valley Outfit mighty quick.\" \n \n There was a rush toward him, but he dashed out of the door and away. \n \n Then followed an instant move toward the solitary and defiant figure of the Valley boss. \n \n \"Halt! You drunken dogs!\" cried Pullar in a voice that effected his purpose. \n \n Pausing, the crowd eyed their quarry cautiously, warned by the terrible flame leaping from the eyes where but a moment before glimmered a whimsical smile. Holding his pipe to his lips with a match ready to light, he addressed them quietly. \n \n \"I was getting ready,\" said he, \"to hit the trail for The Craggs when McClure worked himself up over this bet. I\u0027m not interested in his little gamble. But I am tolerable anxious over the important matter of hiking along home to milk the cows. I\u0027m going to pass out that door and I\u0027d hate to hustle any of you fellows unnecessarily.\" \n \n He took a step toward them. There was an involuntary movement to retreat. Pullar laughed and the threshers, with wild yells, rushed at their prey. Above the clamour rose the bull-like roar of McClure. \n \n \"Throw the big stiff!\" he shouted. \"Mush him under your boots before his gang get here. Put him out and we\u0027ll handle them.\" \n \n With answering shouts they leaped to the attack. Pullar stepped back lightly, feigning retreat. Drawn by the ruse two sprang after him. Suddenly they felt a clutch like steel. Separating the two assailants he brought them together with a trap-like shutting of his muscular arms. Their heads met with a muffled shock and he sent them reeling to the wall. Hands were grasping for him as he shot out his right fist and his left and two more of his demented foes sank to their knees. Making a lightning side step he sprang away, freeing himself from the gripping tentacles of the gang. \n \n In a flashing glimpse he found that he had dodged the attack en masse only to throw himself in the path of Snoopy Bill Baird. The huge slouching form was charging him wickedly. He twisted aside to elude the onset but was unable to avoid the kick of the heavy boot. It caught him along the cheek-bone, ripping the flesh. He closed, clinching his assailant. The big fellows were well matched, but with a confusing speed Pullar had pinned Baird\u0027s arms in a girdling grip. Tripping his great, writhing captive over his hip he flung him clean away above his head. Like a flying missile the man shot through the air, crashing down sprawlingly upon a pool table. \n \n Pullar was not aware that his huge antagonist lay on the table a groaning heap, for they were dragging him down on all sides. Two of his assailants clung to his arms, robbing him of any means of defense, while a third belaboured him fiercely about the head. Still another fastened on his throat. This latter clutched Pullar\u0027s neck with both hands, gouging his thumbs into the windpipe with vicious design to strangle. The vital grip began to tell and slowly at first, then with a chuck, they went to the floor. \n \n \"Hold him! Hold him!\" shouted McClure gleefully as he danced about seeking a chance to strike. But a sudden change came over the battle. The fall had shaken the bulldog clutch. By a prodigious effort Pullar wrenched his right arm free. There was a series of quick, jabbing motions and the four assailants fell magically away. With a bound Pullar was on his feet facing McClure. The latter struck furiously for the face but his blow was swept aside by something rigid. Pullar stood inside his enemy\u0027s guard. He had but to strike and it would be over. He did not strike. Instead he smiled through the blood and stepped lightly back. \n \n \"No, McClure!\" said he with a grim smile. \"I don\u0027t need to.\" \n \n The other looked at him a moment then breathed a low oath of surprise. At that instant there was a great shout and the Valley Gang charged through the door. Turning to the gang Ned Pullar lifted his hands and shouted out above the tumult: \n \n \"Back, men! This fracas is over!\" \n \n \"Not on yer life!\" cried Easy Murphy, angered to fighting-mad pitch by the sight of the bloody face of his boss. \n \n \"The fight is over!\" cried Ned, holding back his men. \n \n \"Begobs! Ye don\u0027t know this wan Irish divil, Ned?\" screamed Murphy. \"I wull be afthurr pluggin\u0027 the lights uv me frind McClure.\" \n \n At the words he stepped toward McClure, followed by the others. But he was intercepted by a swift motion of Pullar. \n \n \"No, Easy!\" cried the young boss firmly. \"Stick with me, lad. This is my powwow. We are about to smoke the pipe of peace.\" \n \n For a fleeting instant he caught the Irishman\u0027s eye. The flash of intelligence that passed between them checked the belligerent passion in Murphy\u0027s wild heart. With a significant and rueful nod the thresher agreed to Pullar\u0027s wish. \n \n \"Ah, Ned, darlint!\" said he affectionately, taking in the room at a sweeping glance. \"For why have ye bin mussin\u0027 up Rob\u0027s bowld byes? \u0027Tis a cyclone blower ye are, me hearty. Go ahead wid the show. The Valley Gang\u0027s occupyin\u0027 the front sates.\" \n \n With a very bad grace the Valley Outfit followed their spokesman\u0027s lead. The eyes of the two gangs turned to Ned. \n \n Aside from the gash along his cheek he was unhurt. Walking in among McClure\u0027s men he picked up his pipe. Repacking the tobacco carefully he lit up. Throwing a series of blue circles to the ceiling he indulged in a moment\u0027s reminiscence. Finally he spoke, addressing Easy Murphy in his usual quiet tone. \n \n \"A few minutes ago,\" said he, \"Rob McClure was eating his head off over a certain little proposition when—we had a slight interruption. In fact, I was anxious to get home to the milking. I have changed my mind. Rob\u0027s proposal will interest you. He wants to stack his huskies up against the Valley Gang on a thirty-day run. He contends laying down a trifle of five hundred dollars that he can lick my gang——\" \n \n Here arose a sudden commotion, savage threats and a sinister movement of the Valley Gang. Ned waved his men back with a laugh. \n \n \"Just a minute, lads,\" said he. \"Let me have my say. McClure pretends that he can lick the Valley Outfit in a thirty day out-put. Strange as it may seem I cannot agree with him. If he will make a real bet, make it cash and approve Jack Butte as holder of stakes, we\u0027ll be able to start something right off the bat.\" \n \n On the heels of his words rose a chorus of defies from his men. Hands flew to pockets and wads appeared. Snoopy Bill caught his feet groggily scenting a gamble. In Rob McClure\u0027s eyes shone the gleam of the shark. \n \n \"Now you\u0027re spunking up!\" said he with a sneer. \"Butte\u0027s our man.\" \n \n Turning to one of his gang, he said: \n \n \"Scoot out, Ford, and get him.\" \n \n While the man started off to carry out his bidding he whipped out his check book and filled in a form. As Snoopy Bill spied the amount he let out a low whistle. \n \n \"Two thousand!\" he exclaimed. \"Rob, you\u0027re a la-la.\" \n \n McClure handed the book to Pullar. Ned read it with immobile face. Amid a deep silence the crowd pressed around the bosses. Would Pullar call the bluff? \n \n The year of which we write was the fall of nineteen hundred. The smoke of the tractor was rarely seen in the land. Of the gas-power machine there was no sign whatever. For five years Ned had swung steadily along the Valley\u0027s brow with his twenty-horse, thirty-six inch portable mill, threshing the line of farmers rimming the northern bank of The Qu\u0027Appelle. If a farmer got Pullar\u0027s mill it assured him a straight crew, a quick, clean job and all his grain. The Valley Gang was thoroughly workmanlike, the crack outfit of the Pellawa stretches. \n \n This supremacy was now disputed. Some ten years before McClure had come from the East with bags of money and bushels of confidence, not to mention a stock of real ability. He was keen to get and heady and aggressive in the getting. Three years before he had entered the threshing game and pitched in with his usual gusto. One of his first moves was to cross the Valley and make a bold raid on Pullar\u0027s run. But his effort failed. Pullar\u0027s line of jobs remained intact. He managed to pick up a few farmers thrown on the threshing market through the defunct condition of their syndicate machine. Since Pullar\u0027s outfit was full up for a big season the cluster of jobs fell to McClure. The farmers of the Pullar run threw out some banter and an occasional jab resenting the attempt of McClure to cut in. This nettled McClure and was the small beginning of a bitter rivalry. Smothering his chagrin McClure set to work to build up a gang that would lower the colours of the Valley Outfit. At the end of the season it was found that Pullar\u0027s bushelage had far exceeded that of the rival machine. The following year repeated their fortunes. Then McClure startled Pellawa by exchanging his portable outfit for an immense forty-inch separator driven by a thirty-horse tractor steam power, of course. The new machine was equipped with self-feeder, self-bagger and cyclone blower. Adding extensively to his run he put on a large gang and began the season with everything in his favour. \n \n Though facing alarming odds, Pullar took up the gauge in his quiet way. Rumours of record days by both machines drifted about the settlement with the result that the annual threshing derby began to show a tendency toward even money. The interested public pricked up its ears, enjoying the come-back of Ned. This popularity, with the complication of a three-day boose fest, was responsible for McClure\u0027s insulting challenge. \n \n Ned was still scanning the check when Jack Butte appeared in the doorway. \n \n \"Just in time, Jack!\" greeted Ned with a grin. \"Hold this money for McClure. We are hooking up for a two-hand game, gang for gang.\" \n \n There was a roar of applause from the Valley threshers. Above the noise rose the voice of Easy Murphy. He was performing the sailor\u0027s hornpipe before the shifty form of Snoopy Bill. \n \n \"Come across wid yer dust,\" challenged Murphy. \"Fifty till fifty we skin ye aloive!\" \n \n \"Taken!\" was the eager acceptance. \"Here, Butte\u0027s the dough. You can hand it back when the cows come home.\" \n \n Butte was deluged with wagers. \n \n \"Hold your horses!\" cried he, lifting protesting hands. \"Two at a time. Come along quietly and we\u0027ll fix it all snug.\" \n \n Taking out his note-book he made punctilious entry of all stakes. His task completed he took the trouble to plainly restate conditions. \n \n \"I\u0027ll bank this bunch of grass,\" he concluded. \"The game winds up at eight P.M. on the last day of October. We\u0027ll meet in Louie Swale\u0027s Emporium and cash in. Meet me there at ten o\u0027clock. And, gentlemen——\" \n \n He paused, reading the faces of the bosses and their men with keen eyes. \n \n \"This game\u0027s to be run on the square. Do you get me?\" \n \n \"Right-o!\" agreed McClure. \"We\u0027ll shear these lambs on Hallowe\u0027en.\" \n \n Ignoring the jibe Ned Pullar pointed to the checks wedged in the pile of bills. They were McClure\u0027s and his own. Speaking quietly to Butte he said: \n \n \"You\u0027ll cash those papers and re-bank the whole amount in your own name?\" \n \n \"Exactly!\" replied Butte, flashing sharp eyes at the young boss. \n \n \"Good!\" was the low response. \n \n Taking a step nearer McClure, Pullar fastened his eyes on the face of his enemy. The lips of the older man were parted about to make some insulting fling when he bit his tongue. Ned\u0027s eyes were smiling but behind the smile glittered an ominous light that made McClure strike an attitude of defense. He retreated a step, watching the other. In an instant the air was electric. There was a shout from the Valley men and they leaped up beside their boss. \n \n \"Since this little deal is satisfactorily arranged, McClure,\" said Ned casually, \"it may occur to you that your cows need milking. At any rate, the Valley Gang have taken a sudden whim to be alone. Think it over. We\u0027ll give you exactly one minute to get out. If you are here sixty seconds hence we\u0027ll maul you a little and—throw you out.\" \n \n Ned took his watch from his pocket while the Valley Gang let out a defiant and joyful shout. \n \n There was a malignant growl from the belligerent gang across the room at the sudden challenge. Rage swept over them but they made no move to close with their taunting enemies. The Valley men flung jeer and jibe in wild effort to provoke a charge. Hissing a terrible oath McClure turned to his men. What he saw decided him. Pointing to the door he addressed them. \n \n \"Cowards!\" he snarled. \"Get out!\" \n \n With a slouching alacrity they obeyed, vanishing through the door in swift and ignominious retreat. McClure passed after them without a word. \n \n \"Tin seconds till spare, the lucky divils!\" cried Easy Murphy regretfully. \n \n At his rueful words the Valley Outfit lifted a victorious roar, following McClure and his men with shouts of derision. \n \n Ten minutes later as Ned Pullar stood in the pool-room door a white horse dashed by, cantering along the slushy street. Astride swayed the form of a girl clothed in a slicker. Beneath her quaint hood flashed the light of brown eyes. Their quick glance caught his salute. She acknowledged the greeting by a dainty tip of her head and the faintest of smiles. \n \n The slight recognition sent his blood atingle. In a moment she disappeared about a building. The vision of the girl remained with him and a shadow contended with the pleasure the sudden meeting had brought into his face. Finally the shadow triumphed and a deeply troubled look came into his eyes. \n \n \"Ah, Mary!\" he reflected. \"Where will this day\u0027s work lead us?\" \n \n The girl was Mary McClure, only child of his avowed enemy. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1890/54540.html","bookId":792,"book":{"id":792,"title":"The Valley of Gold","description":"简介： The east wind blew furiously, beating gray sheets down the streaming panes.
