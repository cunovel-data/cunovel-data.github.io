{"id":38343,"no":11,"title":"XI THE THIRD RIDER","content":"Margaret Grant paced the terrace, her black hair flowing in the wind. The sun flooded the Valley with a prodigal outpouring of his golden tanks. The girl\u0027s eyes snapped with the vivacity of life, for the world was streaming with light and the birds were carolling in joyous abandon. Something in the bubbling wildness of the morning lent a nimbleness to her feet, and she would change her sedate walk for a tripping scurry across the lawn. She cast frequent glances over the gorge to the Peak of the Buffalo Trails in evident anticipation of some appearance there. While she waited she let her eyes sweep down the Valley, her heart and ofttimes her feet dancing with the sun. Margaret was a child of The Qu\u0027Appelle. The gleaming valley had nursed her through childhood, writing the beauty of hill and stream and wind and sun into the little girl, making her skin as brown as that of the metis maiden, her blood warm and red and her soul free with the purity of the flashing light. She loved the cottonwoods and the poplars and the clustering, glistening birch, while the oak and willow folk cast a spell over her. She knew the berry and cherry trees and the sun-steeped slopes where browned the sweetest hazelnuts. Ask her where coquettes the wine-black saskatoon or the wonder berry—and she can tell. As for the flowers, the bees and Margaret were twin possessors. Equally dear were the people of feather and fur. The lake was a fascinating, joyous mystery, whether it lay under her eyes a thing of shimmering light or frowning shadows. Its magic swept her most powerfully. In the moments of its hush, when it became a great calm silence, rippleless and infinitely deep, a new vastness with its own blue sky and clouds and shapely hills. Far out in the lake lay a tiny island tufted with cottonwood shrubs and one ragged scrub oak. This tree had grown out of a crevice in the rock. The island was nothing more than a huge boulder and the bower of cottonwoods and bit of turf held precariously to the smoothed surface. Here the girl enjoyed the dulcet music of the waves and the solitude, reaching the island easily by aid of her birch canoe. From its behaviour in time of tempest this lonely spot had received the name of The Storm Rock. Long before the waves had worked into rollers an angry cloud of white spray above the rock portended the fury of the storm. Suddenly the girl paused in her walk and fastened her eyes on the Peak of the Buffalo Trails. A glimmer of white crowned the Peak. She gave an exclamation of delight as she defined the form of Bobs. Astride was Mary McClure. A signal passed between the girls. Turning slightly, Margaret swept the north bank with a keen glance, emitting another ejaculation as she saw a rider cantering along the shoulder of the hill making his way down into the valley. \"Ned!\" she observed, with a droll tip of her head. \"You are remarkably punctual, my fine fellow. You need not push Darkey so fast, however, for Flash and I are going to take a very considerable time to saddle up.\" Turning about, she glanced up at the Peak again. Bobs and his rider had disappeared. As she continued to look at the empty summit she was surprised to see another rider trot out on the hill. It was a man, and he halted his horse in the identical place where Mary had sat Bobs but a moment before. He looked over the valley toward the Grant homestead, then turning, vanished hurriedly down the hill. The watcher was at a loss to account for the appearance of the strange rider. She pondered a moment. \"One of Blythes\u0027 cow-punchers!\" was her conclusion. \"He is probably beating up strays.\" Satisfied and relieved at her surmise she ran into the house to prepare for the ride to Willow Glade. Ned rode swiftly along, skirting the lake about the Pellawa end. He had an hour of fast riding before he at length disappeared into the groves near the brook. As he broke into the Glade he saw Bobs tied to a tree and his mistress seated on the log beside the stream. \"Ho, ho! Darkey!\" he cried softly. \"High fortune is ours!\" Bobs tossed his head in equine friendliness, but the figure on the log was absorbed in a study of the tree-tops. Tying his horse, Ned stole up on the silent one. \"Room for another on the observation car?\" called Ned in her ear. With a casual \"Good-day, Ned!\" she glanced into his eyes. Her face was so irresistibly teasing that he seized her hands. \"I am welcome, Mary?\" said he. Her reply was smothered by his lips. When conditions had become normal once more she announced importantly: \"I came here to-day, Ned, with the deliberate purpose of having an interview with you.\" \"That is delightfully gratifying,\" was the reply. \"But since I know the lady so well I fear there is another reason forthcoming.\" \"We are to have a chaperon,\" resumed Mary. \"I signalled Margaret from the Peak of the Buffalo Trails. She will be here—within—an hour or two. Flash has taken to loitering, I fear.\" \"Yes, we know what a sleepy nag Flash can be when Margaret has so made up her mind.\" \"You speak as though there is a little plot on foot.\" \"Rather on four feet, Mary.\" Catching his eye Mary laughed. \"But there is another reason?\" was his serious question. \"Are you in trouble, Mary?\" \"No,\" was her reply. \"I am deeply interested in some one other than Mr. Pullar, Jr. And also in a number of things—the Red Knight, for example. Why have you not come over to the school sometimes with your father?\" He looked into her eyes with a frankness that satisfied her. She nodded comprehendingly. \"You did right,\" said she gently. \"We agree that it was best. But I have wanted to consult you about the Red Knight. I think it is such a big, wonderful thing, and it means so much to your father. Do you——\" Further speech was suddenly interrupted by a commotion in the woods. Bobs gave a vigorous whinny to which Darkey responded in a half-frightened way while both horses moved restively about their trees, nostrils distended and ears pricked forward. \"What can be troubling the horses?\" said Mary looking about. A careful scrutiny of the trees and underbrush failed to discover anything unusual. \"Probably a fox or a wolf,\" surmised Ned. \"The brute was bold to come so near. The horses have become aware of some marauder.\" They let it go at that, little thinking that the horses had a surprising reason for their unrest. For five minutes past a shadow had been slipping through the dense growth running toward the lake and had chanced a flit of a half dozen yards in the open to a clump of willows within a rod of the log on which they sat. Screened in the low trees lurked the crouching figure of Reddy Sykes. It was a fox, indeed, a human fox that had agitated Bobs and his companion. The face of the agent was uncouth in its strange determination and jealousy. Waiting until quiet was restored he parted the leaves and took a glance at the objects of his bold espionage. At sight of the lovers his face went white and a wave of passion swept over him. As Mary resumed the conversation he listened with an eagerness wild and intense. \"I was saying,\" said Mary, \"that The Red Knight has a powerful interest for your father.\" \"I am sure you discovered that easily,\" returned Ned. \"Yes. It is as dear to him as life itself. No mother could lavish more fondness upon her babe than your father does upon this marvellous new wheat.\" \"And because it means so much to Dad,\" said Ned gently, \"it means even more to me. Yet I, too, am foolish over The Red Knight. I wonder can any one understand how it is that the roots of this plant go back so deep into the lives of Dad and me? It has grown out of the hard, glorious years. It is the one living thing linking our dear dead to us. Mary! It is my little mother\u0027s forget-me-not. The tenderest sentiment gathers about The Red Knight.\" Mary laid her hand gently on his arm. \"Ned,\" she said, looking at him with the shine of dew in her eyes, \"you will always foster this dear foolishness, will you not?\" Drawing her to him he kissed lips and cheeks and hair. \"I know you will,\" was her glad cry. \"But there is the other side,\" said Ned in a little. \"The Red Knight is as astonishing a discovery for the good of the world as was steam in its application to transportation and industry. This is how Dad views it. Like the discovery of a new element it should be retained for the common human good. If controlled by the commercial interests and monopolists it will be lost. The Red Knight needs the care of the keenest and surest cultural science as well as the protection of a wise government. This new variety of wheat is very precious now or will be when the great experts have repeated the tests put through by Dad and myself. By spring, should our own experiments satisfy the competent judges, every bushel of Red Knight would be worth one hundred dollars. Forty thousand dollars! It sounds fabulous to farmers who have spent a lifetime in the fight to catch their feet. Dad, however, will not sell it in that way. He intends to distribute his unique seed in such a way as to insure its preservation and reproduction. Each bushel will go to a source that meets with his entire approval. Some will pay the hundred dollars per bushel, not that a monopolist\u0027s price may be realized but that the recipient may be impressed with the rare pricelessness of The Red Knight. Others will pay but a pittance. The great national farms will not be overlooked. It is Dad\u0027s purpose that when harvest rolls round again there will be from thirty to forty thousand bushels of Red Knight in the hands of the National Government and a corps of splendid farmers. They will agree to keep Red Knight pure and further improve his singular qualities by faithful selection and experiment.\" As Ned finished speaking a deep silence fell on them, broken at length by Mary. \"That four hundred bushels of Red Knight is precious in many ways, Ned,\" said she. \"You have taken precaution to protect it from harm?\" \"We are doing our best to avoid misfortune. We have broken the bin up into three. There are two hundred bushels in the house; we have one hundred in the big granary and the balance is isolated in one of our galvanized-iron, portable bins set in the centre of a large ploughed field. This should provide for the preservation of The Red Knight.\" They had fully discussed the scheme of launching the astounding fact of the discovered variety when Margaret Grant dashed into the glade with a shout and a clatter of hoofs. \"Greetings, kind friends!\" she announced with a swagger. \"Permit Flash, four-footed gentleman of the highroad, to join your sweet company with Gooseberry up.\" \"To horse!\" cried Ned, catching the conceit of the girl. \"To horse! We ride with the gallant Goose!\" \"The very thing!\" laughed Mary. Riding close Margaret struck vengefully. But Ned dodged and assisting Mary into the saddle swung up on Darkey and the laughing cavalcade rode out of the glade. From his covert Reddy Sykes saw them depart. Waiting until he was sure they were safely away he returned to his horse and mounting rode hastily back to Pellawa.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1890/54550.html","bookId":792,"book":{"id":792,"title":"The Valley of Gold","description":"简介： The east wind blew furiously, beating gray sheets down the streaming panes.
