{"id":38357,"no":25,"title":"XXV THE EMPTY SADDLE","content":"After tearing free from Sykes, Bobs galloped through the woods till with true broncho instinct he circled to the trail and shot post haste for home. After a time his terror passed and he reduced his speed to a comfortable canter, then to a trot and finally to a walk. Loitering leisurely along the way he nibbled choice tufts of grass. \\n\\n \\n\\n When the hour of Mary\u0027s home-coming arrived and there was no sight of her along the Valley trail, Helen McClure grew mildly anxious. With the passage of an hour and still no sign she became alarmed and consulted McClure. He betrayed no evidences of anxiety and endeavoured to calm the agitated woman. It was during the furious outbreak of the storm that she saw the riderless horse trot swiftly down the lane. A dread seized her and she called to Rob. \\n\\n \\n\\n He was seated in his office, his eye fixed in remarkable tenderness upon the two faces that for the last few days had haunted him. The anguished tone of his wife smote him and a wave of shame passed over his face. He dropped his head upon his hand. A curious enervation sapped his strength. That cry with its tender distress broke something hard within him. He could not lift up his head. The fact of the bribe and its mighty lure were forgotten. In the space of one marvellous instant he became humane. In upon him surged an overwhelming solicitude for Mary\u0027s safety. Endearing memories rushed upon him. His dishonour and the pathos of Mary\u0027s betrayal cried out in the smitten cry of his wife. Remorse and contrition were strangely confused in the mind that refused to work with its accustomed celerity. Grimly he reflected that the office of the blue automatic was desirable. Opening the drawer he thrust his hand within. The gun was gone. Who could take it? His wife? Mary? Ah, it was Mary. He brushed his brow in a troubled gesture. In upon the deepening gloom burst a disquieting fear. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Rob!\" came the cry again in a low frightened tone. \"Bobs has come home without Mary. He must have thrown her. Perhaps she is injured or—killed.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Tut, tut, Helen!\" was his answer. \"She is not hurt. Have no fear for Mary. She is too good a rider. She is walking along the trail.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But it is so late,\" objected the mother anxiously. \\n\\n \\n\\n Together they went out to where Bobs was refreshing himself at the trough. A quick examination of the horse aroused in McClure a new uneasiness. The bridle was torn and the rein gone. Suddenly Helen discovered something Rob hoped she would not see. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Here are marks of the spurs,\" called his wife. \"Mary never uses these terrible things.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She pointed to red dabs along the flank. \\n\\n \\n\\n Passing about the horse Rob discovered a bloody mark on Bobs\u0027 white hip that aroused a panic in his own breast. Beneath the smear of blood there was no wound. His wife detected what he was looking at. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That cannot be from the spurs,\" she cried in a stricken voice. \"Mary has met with an accident, that she made a wild effort to escape.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She sought his eye. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Listen, Helen!\" said he in a low tone, transfixed by her compelling glance. \"Do not jump to wild conclusions and believe all I say. You may never forgive me. You must believe me. Mary is not hurt. She has gone with Chesley Sykes. They will come back again. He was to intercept her on her way from school. It was all arranged. I gave my consent and Hank Foyle was to help him out. He will marry our girl.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n His confession had come in a slow, passionless voice. As the truth dawned upon her the blood receded from her face, leaving her white and haggard. Old age seemed to have fallen magically upon her. Her lips moved as if to speak, but no sound issued forth. She reeled as if struck. Rob threw his arms about her. At his touch she stood erect and rigid. Thrusting him gently from her, she turned away with a low moan. \\n\\n \\n\\n With bowed head he led Bobs to the stable and went slowly, dazedly into the house. All within was quiet. The stillness troubled him. His wife had secluded herself. He called her name but no answer came back. Making a swift search he found her at length in Mary\u0027s room. She knelt before the bed fondling some trinkets she had spread out upon the counterpane. Her eyes were fixed upon a tiny photograph. It was a likeness of Mary when a babe. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah, poor little baby!\" she whispered. \"They have broken your dear little heart.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n As Rob watched the stricken creature an exquisite pain stabbed his own soul. Walking over to her he threw his great arms about her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Listen, Helen,\" said he brokenly. \"Before God Almighty I\u0027ll bring Mary back to you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She seemed not to hear him. \\n\\n \\n\\n Rising he walked out. \\n\\n \\n\\n Hitching up his team he pushed them at a terrific pace for Magee\u0027s Cove. He arrived at the Cove thankful to find that the bloods were still there. He was ahead of the boat. He soon discovered it out in the lake and in grave peril. Before he could fully realize the situation the boat crashed upon the Storm Rock. In the closing dusk he fancied he saw a gleam of white upon the rock. Obsessed with a wild hope that it was Mary he sent his horses at a gallop to Magee\u0027s and got out his big steam launch just as Andy and his party came up, bent on the same purpose. Supplementing the engine with oars they drove for the rock, picking Foyle up near shore. The tale he gave them impelled them to heroic effort and they fought their way steadily toward the rock. When near they discovered two figures, taking them for Mary and Sykes. Their astonishment knew no bounds when they found out that Mary\u0027s companion was Ned. \\n\\n \\n\\n The return was effected easily and speedily. The boat was cutting through the breakers not far from shore when Lawrie, who was in the prow, gave a peculiar cry and signalled the reversal of the engine. It was called forth by an object rocking amid the flotsam. Instantly the boat was halted and backed to where the object lay in the water. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My God!\" cried Easy Murphy, as they rode alongside. \"It\u0027s Sykes, poor divil!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n At the words a moan came from somebody. Through McClure passed a shudder and he drew Mary close to him. Producing a rope they attached it to the gruesome thing out in the waves and started shoreward once more. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mary was taken direct to her home. Mrs. Grant insisted on warmth and refreshment, but Rob would hear of no delay. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Her mother is waiting,\" said he, with the saddest of smiles. \\n\\n \\n\\n The drive was accomplished at a speed that brought the bays to rest at the McClure threshold in a reek of sweat. \\n\\n \\n\\n On that home-coming no eyes must peer. Upon Helen McClure\u0027s face lay the ineffaceable scars of her dark vigil. But her heart was healed by the miracle of the storm. \\n\\n \\n\\n And Ned? The tonic of love and youth more than pulled him through. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1890/54564.html","bookId":792,"book":{"id":792,"title":"The Valley of Gold","description":"简介： The east wind blew furiously, beating gray sheets down the streaming panes.
