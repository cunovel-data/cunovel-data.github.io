{"id":38334,"no":2,"title":"II THE VALLEY OF GOLD","content":"The wind drifted along the valley crisp with the breath of the harvest dawn. It blew gently over the prairies flowing in from the west. Speeding valleyward a horse and rider zigzagged in easy canter through the shrublands. They clung to the deep paths of the buffaloes, dug long years ago by countless droves threading their way to the stream in the great ravine. \n \n It was the girl\u0027s delight to \"trail\" these grass-grown ruts through the dense groves hanging shaggily to the south banks. In a little they ran out on a high shoulder of The Qu\u0027Appelle. Here the bare hill was ribbed with the parallel paths to the number of seven or eight that slipped over the ravine crest, disappearing a few paces below into a thick grove of stunted oak. Halting the eager broncho, the girl let her eyes rest on the valley. \n \n It was a pretty gulf cleaving the prairie for a width of two or three miles and winding out of sight into the blue distance. There was visible the shine of lakes and their linking streams. Under the amber light of the autumnal sunrise the valley was pricked out into a landscape of gold. The bank upon which they stood swept away to the southeast in a forest crescent wonderful with the variegated leafage of the searing year. Paling greens, bright yellows, faint oranges mingled with browns and buffs and the brilliant wines and reds. Falling away from their feet the colourful forest was a charming Joseph\u0027s coat, but in the spacious distance its mottled glory blent into the russet-yellow of the prairie autumn. \n \n The north bank rose beyond, walling the ravine in a billowy rank of great, rounded hills bald as the skull of the golden eagle and seamed with dark lines of wooded gulches. Here and there along the crests hung over the edges of the great, harvest blanket, strips of wheat fields studded with their nuggets of brown stooks. In the blue radiance above drifted a fleet of soft clouds with creamy breasts and fringes of amber fire. On the floor of the valley lay a lake spread out in a broad silver ribbon that rose to the skyline for miles into the west. \n \n \"You beautiful Qu\u0027Appelle!\" cried the girl softly. \"We love you—Bobs and I.\" \n \n For many minutes she revelled in the ecstasy of gleaming morning and golden valley, her cheeks bitten to roses by the tanging wind-drift. At length she granted release to her impatient horse and let him dash down into the trees. Under their branches she drew him to a walk and, leaving the selection of their trail to the petulant Bobs, abandoned herself to the alchemy of the harvest woods. \n \n Passing slowly through the depths of a grove of white-stemmed poplars they ran out into a tiny glade. Here The Willow, a pretty brook, dammed by industrious beavers, gathered itself into a little pond before its last wild rush to the lake. As they cleared the trees Bobs pricked up his ears and quickened his step, giving a low whinny. His rider glanced curiously ahead, surprised to see a horseman in the pool. Her face changed suddenly from surprise to pleasure. The horse was sipping the cool water. The rider was Ned Pullar. \n \n \"Mary!\" he cried delightedly, sending his horse through the stream. \"This is my lucky day. Darkey and I have been haunting Willow Glade for an hour past hoping just this, but never dreaming that you and Bobs would really show up.\" \n \n \"How did you know I was coming?\" demanded the girl happily. \n \n \"I did not know,\" was the reply. \"I only knew this to be one of your favourite haunts on a Sunday morning and conceived a long chance of meeting you here. It was necessary to have a personal talk with you. This morning I determined to see you before the day was gone.\" \n \n \"Are you in trouble, Ned?\" cried the girl suddenly, a soberness driving the pleasure from her face. \n \n \"Very great trouble, Mary,\" said Ned. \"Do you not know?\" \n \n Deeply he searched the eyes looking into his. He could tell by the innocence, the solicitude of them that they had not learned the thing he feared. He was greatly relieved. \n \n \"What is it, Ned?\" was her anxious query. \"I have heard of no trouble.\" \n \n \"Perhaps it is only a cloud over the sun,\" was the reply. \"It may pass by. Indeed you have brightened things a lot for me already. Let us breathe our broncs while we talk it all over.\" \n \n Slipping from his saddle he assisted her to dismount. Taking charge of the horses he secured them to adjacent trees and followed to where she had seated herself on a gnarled log at the foot of the little falls. \n \n \"I have a little surprise for you,\" said he, throwing himself on the leaves at her feet. \"I am not returning to college this fall.\" \n \n Her eyes opened wide, expressing a mystified incredulity. \n \n \"Sad but true!\" was his reiteration. \n \n \"But your year, Ned! It is your final. You must finish.\" \n \n \"Sheer foolishness, eh? This smashing of a final year? So it seemed to me for a little. Only a little. I cannot leave Dad.\" \n \n At the words he averted his eyes. \n \n She studied the downcast face, an expression of pride growing in her eyes. \n \n \"You understand, I am sure,\" said he softly. \"It has been worse this vacation than ever before. Dad\u0027s at a great disadvantage now and I have to watch him like a lynx. Swale\u0027s bar is a powerful lodestone. But he is bracing gamely. He has not touched the stuff for three weeks and if I stay with him now I believe he\u0027ll win out. Then I\u0027ll not lose the year after all. A steady grind at the homestead should work out an extra-mural pass, and I could pull down my degree with the rest of you.\" \n \n \"You will be missed, Ned.\" \n \n He looked up quickly into her eyes. They were a peculiar mixture of sympathy and fun. \n \n \"Undoubtedly!\" agreed Ned disconsolately, though his eyes twinkled. \"How the Registrar will grieve at the non-appearance of my hitherto regular fee. And Grimes, sweet janitor! He will drop not a tear, but a diabolic wink at my sudden demise.\" \n \n \"Mercenary Registrar!\" sighed Mary. \"And unspeakably happy Grimes! Doubtful mourners, I admit. But others will follow the two chiefs. I see the Rugby Team pacing after slowly and aghast. They mourn Captain and star punter at one fell stroke or rather in the unavailable person of one fellow, Pullar. Methinks there was to have been a great International Debate. But now?—How can I go on down the long line? Behold the Winged Seven, favourites for the Hockey Cup, now, alas, the Wingless Six! And the Eight-oared Crew?—Can you not see that you will be missed ever so little?\" \n \n Ned looked up with a rueful grin. \n \n \"Grave losses all,\" replied Ned. \"The ironic heartlessness of the small Co-ed notwithstanding. Varsity will gradually recover from her terrible handicap. Infinitely more terrible is it for me. Calculate the unmaterialized wisdom of four hundred priceless lectures. But, after all—it is nothing.\" \n \n \"No-o?\" commented Mary slyly in sceptical demur. \n \n Ned glanced into the brown eyes in time to surprise a smile uniquely pleasing in its whimsical delight. Instantly they became mockingly sober. \n \n \"Mary!\" said he seriously, holding her gaze. \"Will you miss me?\" \n \n The girl\u0027s eyes wandered suddenly to tree, sky, brook, finally resting on a log at their feet. \n \n \"What a sudden switch from general to particular,\" said she, absorbed apparently in the task of pecking a hole in the bark with the dainty toe of her riding-boot. \n \n Laughing quietly Ned proceeded. \n \n \"If you could peep into my mind, Mary, you would find a seething resentment there. And all because of you. Soon you will be rejoining the old class. There\u0027s the rub. I cannot conceive of Pellawa without you.\" \n \n \"Indeed?\" \n \n \"And a very big \u0027indeed,\u0027\" aggrieved Ned. \"To think that Rooter Combes and his rah-rahs will be in clover. This obsession has been actively depressing since last Thursday. Perhaps you remember riding by Sparrow\u0027s. You looked quaintly desirable in that chic, brown slicker——\" \n \n \"With my face all spattered and Bobs a mud tramp!\" \n \n \"I did not see Bobs at all, just a chicily hooded girl with peeping curls of brown hair, flashing eyes and a nod adorably imperious but very welcome.\" \n \n \"I should not have recognized you.\" \n \n \"But you did and at that particular moment the act was doubly precious to me. How can I resign you, Mary, to the too tender solicitude of Combes and those dear fellows?\" \n \n Mary tipped her head reflectively while she read his half-serious eyes. \n \n \"Is this your trouble, Ned?\" said she smiling frankly down at him. \"Do you mean that you will miss me—quite a little?\" \n \n \"Just so. Since you comprise the population of Pellawa—for me. But——\" \n \n \"You may not be called upon to forego the society of this so immensely necessary person.\" \n \n Now it was his eyes that opened wide. \n \n \"I have a piece of big news for you,\" continued Mary, shaking her head wisely while she enjoyed his surprise. \"I, too, am dropping out. No Varsity for me this term. You see me to-day, Ned, a specially permitted schoolma\u0027am. Last Thursday as I rode by Sparrow\u0027s I was on my way to sign the entangling documents. Bridges are all burned. To-morrow I begin teaching—where do you think?\" \n \n He shook his head. \n \n \"In the school of—The Craggs. I shall be your very close neighbour. Mary McClure is not flitting away from you. Combes and his tender-hearted fellows should worry very considerably, I fancy.\" \n \n \"Mary, Mary!\" was the elated cry. \"I am sorry for you but riotously happy for myself.\" \n \n She looked down upon him a moment with eyes brimmingly glad, then a shadow crept into them. \n \n \"I am spending this year with Mother and Dad,\" she said simply. \n \n Looking earnestly at her he caught the shine of tears. Stifling the gay words leaping to his lips he rose and stepping to her drew her head to his breast. \n \n \"Mary,\" said he gently, \"our work is planned for a year ahead. Home is the only place for us just now.\" \n \n \"We\u0027ll make it a great year, Ned,\" was the hopeful reply. \"When I was a little girl, everything good for Mother and Dad was described as \u0027bestest.\u0027 This is to be the \u0027bestest\u0027 year for our loved ones that they have ever known. Can we make it so?\" \n \n \"You are only a little girl yet,\" said Ned, kissing the face turned up to him. \"And this is to be their \u0027bestest\u0027 year. We shall see to that. Now for my trouble, the thing that drove me out to find you. These last moments have made it deepen rather than vanish. On Thursday afternoon, a short time before I saw you, I had an adventure. Have you heard of it?\" \n \n \"Not even a rumour, Ned. Mother and I are not as intimate with Pellawa life as we should be.\" \n \n \"I am glad you have not heard,\" said Ned earnestly. \"There was an encounter in the pool-room. Your father was involved.\" \n \n At Ned\u0027s words a fear flashed into the girl\u0027s eyes. \n \n \"Your father and I have made rather slow progress in our mutual acquaintanceship. We got to know each other much better at Sparrow\u0027s. I cannot say the event has helped any. We are now enemies publicly acknowledged. At least your father so considers me. The clash was sharp and promises serious trouble ahead for us. It will hamper us not a little in our plans of the last few minutes.\" \n \n \"Ned!\" she cried with lips a-tremble. \"You did not fight? Not that?\" \n \n He looked at her, deeply troubled by the white face and the pain in her glance. She was looking at the scar on his cheek. He thought of the wager. A staggering regret swept over him. He was about to tell her the whole story, but now? No. She should not know all—just yet. Forcing a reassuring smile he replied: \n \n \"No. We did not fight. It was a touch and go but resulted in nothing more than a sharp brush with your father\u0027s gang. That scratch is from the boot of Bill Baird. I was able to restrain the Valley Gang, thanks to Easy Murphy\u0027s loyalty. Otherwise the worst would have happened. We did not fight and I am confident I can give you my promise that we never shall.\" \n \n Immense relief filled the girl\u0027s eyes. \n \n \"You were in a hard place,\" said she, her look of strange comprehension searching his face. \"You held your hand because—because of our love. I know it.\" \n \n Her sure intuition astonished him, but before he could speak she continued: \n \n \"There is startling cause for cheer in all this, Ned. If you can prevent the terrible possibility I am thinking of, you can win Dad.\" \n \n \"How would you have me do it, Mary?\" was his abrupt appeal. \n \n She pondered deeply, her eyes growing in solicitude as the moments passed. At length she looked at him with troubled face, shaking her head. \n \n \"I do not know,\" was her helpless confession. \"How would you win him?\" \n \n \"The only way is to play the man with him,\" was the slow answer. \"He would turn over heaven or hell to break me. Obviously I must break him.\" \n \n The girl shuddered at the words. Watching the quivering face he was surprised to hear her say: \n \n \"I know there is no other way. One of you must conquer. But there is a condition I want to make. You will be right, always, Ned, as well as irresistible. I know you will.\" \n \n \"I shall always have the right with me. I have it now,\" was the quick reply. \"I expect to butt into stone walls at times, but we shall win out. There is only one great, lurking dread. Sometimes I fear your father may strike at me through you, we mean so much to each other.\" \n \n As he spoke he fancied he saw in her eyes the glimmer of a haunting fear. But it vanished so swiftly he doubted he had ever glimpsed it. The big eyes reading his were heavy with grief. With sudden impulse he crushed her in the shelter of his great arms. \n \n \"I should not have breathed the thought,\" said he penitently. \"Nothing conceivable can ever strike our love, Mary. You are not afraid?\" \n \n \"Not of that,\" was the reply as she nestled contentedly within the strength of him. \"Many things may happen, but not that. Just now Father is obsessed with his new friendship. It is a thousand pities that the friend should be Chesley Sykes. His presence in Pellawa is an ominous mystery to me. So far he has deported himself with desirable aloofness. May he continue to do so. He is completely outside of this beautiful moment. Let us forget him.\" \n \n \"And ride away together,\" suggested Ned. \n \n \"I have an hour yet,\" calculated Mary. \n \n \"We\u0027ll spend it riding No-trail Gulch,\" tempted Ned. \n \n \"Let us away,\" laughed the girl gaily. \"For the trail——\" \n \n \"Is luring,\" completed Ned, leading her to the horses. \n \n A moment later they clattered over the gravel bed of the brook and into the trees. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1890/54541.html","bookId":792,"book":{"id":792,"title":"The Valley of Gold","description":"简介： The east wind blew furiously, beating gray sheets down the streaming panes.
