{"id":19364,"no":7,"title":"THE VICOMTESSE DE CAMBES.VII.","content":"\"My dear Monsieur Lenet,\" said the duke, \"as the women seem to have taken charge of the war, I think it would be a good plan for the men to do a little intriguing. I have heard of a certain Captain Cauvignac, whom you commissioned to raise a company, and who is represented to me as an exceedingly clever sort of fellow. I sent for him; is there any way for me to see him?\" \"He is waiting, monseigneur,\" said Lenet. \"Let him come in, then.\" Lenet pulled a bell-cord, and a servant appeared. \"Send Captain Cauvignac hither,\" said Lenet. An instant after, our old acquaintance appeared in the doorway; but, prudent as always, there he halted. \"Come hither, captain,\" said the duke; \"I am Monsieur le Duc de La Rochefoucauld.\" \"I know you perfectly well, monseigneur,\" said Cauvignac. \"Ah! so much the better, then. You received a commission to raise a company?\" \"It is raised.\" \"How many men have you at your disposal?\" \"A hundred and fifty.\" \"Well armed and equipped?\" \"Well armed, poorly equipped. I looked out for the weapons first of all, as the most essential thing. As to their equipment, as I am a very disinterested youth, and as I am moved principally by my affection for Messieurs les Princes, I came rather short of money, Monsieur Lenet having given me but ten thousand livres.\" \"You have enrolled a hundred and fifty men with ten thousand livres?\" \"Yes, monseigneur.\" \"That\u0027s a marvellous achievement.\" \"I have methods known to myself alone, monseigneur, to which I have resorted.\" \"Where are your men?\" \"They are here; you will see a fine company, monseigneur, especially in respect to their morals,—all men of rank; not a single nobody among them.\" Monsieur de La Rochefoucauld walked to the window, and saw in the street a hundred and fifty individuals of all ages, sizes, and conditions, drawn up in two lines, and kept in place by Ferguzon, Barrabas, Carrotel, and their two colleagues, arrayed in their most magnificent attire. The rank and file resembled a party of bandits much more nearly than a company of soldiers. As Cauvignac had said, they were very much out at elbows, but remarkably well armed. \"Have you received any orders concerning the place where your men are to be stationed?\" the duke inquired. \"I have been ordered to lead them to Vayres, and I am simply awaiting the ratification of that order by Monsieur le Duc to turn over my company to Monsieur Richon, who is expecting its arrival.\" \"But do not you remain at Vayres with them?\" \"My principles, monseigneur, forbid my ever doing such a foolish thing as to shut myself up within four walls, when I am at liberty to go where I please. I was born to lead the life of the patriarchs.\" \"Very good; go where you choose; but despatch your men to Vayres as soon as possible.\" \"Then they are really to form part of the garrison of that place?\" \"Yes.\" \"Under Monsieur Richon\u0027s orders?\" \"Yes.\" \"But, monseigneur, what are my men to do in the fort, where there are already about three hundred men?\" \"You are very inquisitive.\" \"Oh! it\u0027s not mere curiosity that makes me ask, monseigneur; it is fear.\" \"What are you afraid of?\" \"That they will be condemned to inaction, which would be a great pity; any man makes a mistake who allows a good weapon to rust.\" \"Don\u0027t be alarmed, captain, they won\u0027t rust; in a week they will have a chance to fight.\" \"In that case they may be killed!\" \"It\u0027s very likely,—unless, in addition to your secret method of recruiting soldiers, you have a secret method of making them invulnerable.\" \"Oh! it\u0027s not that; but before they are killed I would like to have them paid for.\" \"Didn\u0027t you tell me that you had received ten thousand livres?\" \"Yes, on account. Ask Monsieur Lenet; he is a man of method, and I am sure he will remember our agreement.\" The duke turned to Lenet. \"It is true, Monsieur le Duc,\" said the straightforward counsellor; \"we gave Monsieur Cauvignac ten thousand livres by way of advance for the first outlay; but we promised him a hundred crowns per man.\" \"In that case,\" said the duke, \"we owe the captain thirty-five thousand francs?\" \"Just so, monseigneur.\" \"They will be given you.\" \"Might it not be done now, Monsieur le Duc?\" \"No, impossible.\" \"Why so?\" \"Because you are one of us, and strangers must be settled with first of all. You understand that only those people we fear have to be coaxed.\" \"An excellent maxim!\" said Cauvignac; \"in all bargains, however, it is customary to fix a time for payment.\" \"Very well, let us say a week,\" said the duke. \"A week it is,\" said Cauvignac. \"But suppose that when the week has elapsed we have not paid?\" suggested Lenet. \"In that case I resume control of my men.\" \"That is no more than fair,\" the duke agreed. \"And I can do what I choose with them?\" \"Of course, as they belong to you.\" \"But—\" Lenet began. \"Nonsense!\" said the duke in a low tone,—\"when we have them safely shut up in Vayres!\" \"I don\u0027t like this sort of bargain,\" said Lenet, shaking his head. \"They are very common in Normandy,\" said Cauvignac; \"they are called conditional sales.\" \"Is it agreed?\" asked the duke. \"It is,\" Cauvignac replied. \"When will your men start?\" \"At once, if you so order.\" \"I do so order.\" \"Then they are off, monseigneur.\" The captain went down into the street and said two words in Ferguzon\u0027s ear, and the Cauvignac company, followed by all the idlers whom its strange appearance had attracted, marched away toward the harbor, where the three boats were waiting which were to transport it up the Dordogne to Vayres, while its commander, faithful to the principle of freedom of action just enunciated by him to Monsieur de La Rochefoucauld, stood watching his men affectionately as they moved away. Meanwhile the viscountess in her own apartments was sobbing and praying. \"Alas!\" she moaned, \"I could not save his honor unimpaired, but I will at least save the appearance of honor. He must not be conquered by force; for I know him so well that I know that he would die in defence of the place; it must be made to seem to him that he is overcome by treason. Then, when he knows what I have done for him, and, above all, my object in doing it, beaten as he is, he will bless me still.\" Consoled by this hope, she rose, wrote a few words which she hid in her breast, and returned to Madame la Princesse, who had sent to ask her to go with her to look to the needs of the wounded and carry consolation and material assistance to the widows and orphans. Madame la Princesse called together all who had taken part in the expedition. In her own name and that of the Dc d\u0027Enghien, she praised the exploits of those who had distinguished themselves; talked a long time with Ravailly, who, although he carried his arm in a sling, declared his readiness to begin again the next morning; laid her hand upon Espagnet\u0027s shoulder, and told him that she looked upon him and his gallant Bordelais as the firmest supporters of her party; in fine, she succeeded so well in inflaming their minds that the most disheartened swore that they would have their revenge, and would have started for ?le Saint-Georges on the instant. \"No, not at this moment,\" said the princess; \"take to-day and to-night for rest, and day after to-morrow you shall be in possession there forever.\" This assurance was welcomed by noisy demonstrations of warlike ardor. Every shout sank deep into the heart of the viscountess, for they were like so many daggers threatening her lover\u0027s existence. \"You hear what I have agreed, Claire,\" said the princess; \"it is for you to see that I do not break my word to these good people.\" \"Never fear, madame,\" was the reply. \"I will perform what I have promised.\" That same evening a messenger set out in hot haste for Saint-Georges.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1647/48668.html","bookId":1205,"book":{"id":1205,"title":"The War of Women Volume 2","description":"简介： Two days later they came in sight of Bordeaux, and it became necessary to decide at once how they should enter the city.
