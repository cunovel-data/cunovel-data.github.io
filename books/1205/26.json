{"id":19383,"no":26,"title":"THE ABBEY OF PEYSSAC.III.","content":"As soon as the viscountess had disappeared, and her voice had died away in the distance, the gate having been closed behind her, the circle of officers drew closer around Canolles, and two men of sinister mien, suddenly appearing as if they had sprung from the ground, approached the duke and humbly awaited his commands. \\n\\n \\n\\n The duke simply pointed to the prisoner. He himself drew near to him, and said, with his customary glacial courtesy:— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Monsieur, you doubtless understand that the departure of your companion in misfortune renders you liable to the penalty which was to be inflicted upon him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, monsieur,\" replied Canolles, \"I suspected as much; but there is one thing of which I am perfectly certain, that Madame la Princesse granted a pardon to me by name. I saw, and you yourself might have seen just now, the order for my release in the hands of Madame la Vicomtesse de Cambes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is true, monsieur,\" said the duke, \"but Madame la Princesse could not have anticipated the present state of affairs.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am to understand, then, that Madame la Princesse recalls her signature?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes,\" replied the duke. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A princess of the blood is false to her word?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The duke maintained his impassive demeanor. \\n\\n \\n\\n Canolles looked about him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Has the time arrived?\" he asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, monsieur.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I thought that you would await the return of Madame la Vicomtesse de Cambes; you promised her that nothing should be done in her absence. It seems that nobody has any regard for his word to-day.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And the prisoner gazed reproachfully, not at the Duc de La Rochefoucauld, but at Lenet. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Alas! monsieur,\" cried the latter, with tears in his eyes, \"forgive us. Madame la Princesse positively refused to show mercy to you. I begged very earnestly none the less; Monsieur le Duc will bear witness to that, and God as well. But she deems it imperative that Richon\u0027s death should be paid for in kind, and she was as immovable as stone. Now do you yourself pass judgment on my conduct, Monsieur le Baron; instead of allowing the burden of your horrible situation to fall partly upon the viscountess, I ventured,—pray forgive me, for I feel that I stand in great need of your forgiveness,—I ventured to cause it to fall upon you alone, for you are a soldier and of gentle birth.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"In that case,\" faltered Canolles, whose voice was choked with emotion, \"in that case I shall not see her again! When you bade me embrace her, it was for the last time!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A sob stronger than stoicism or pride shook Lenet\u0027s frame. He stepped back and wept bitterly. Canolles thereupon fixed his piercing gaze upon the men who stood about him, but could see on every side none but faces rendered stern and pitiless by Richon\u0027s cruel death, and among them a very few timid creatures, who were stiffening their muscles to conceal their emotion and help them to swallow their tears and sighs. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh! it is terrible to think upon,\" murmured the youth, in a moment of superhuman clearness of vision which opens before the soul a boundless field of view over what men call life,—that is to say, a few brief instants of happiness scattered here and there like islands in the midst of an ocean of tears and suffering,—\"terrible to think upon! I had in my arms the woman I adore, who had just told me for the first time that she loved me; I had before me a long and blissful life, the realization of my fondest dream; and lo! in a moment, in a second, death takes the place of it all!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He felt a tightness at his heart, and a pricking sensation in his eyes as if he were going to weep; but he remembered in time that he was, as Lenet said, a soldier and a gentleman. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"O pride,\" he said to himself, \"the only form of courage that has any real existence, come to my aid! Should I bewail the loss of so vain and futile a thing as life? How they would laugh if they could say: \u0027On learning that he was to die, Canolles wept!\u0027 How did I bear myself on the day I was besieged at Saint-Georges, when the Bordelais showed the same eagerness for my death as to-day? I fought, I jested, I laughed. Very good! by the heaven above, which hears my words and is mayhap dealing wrongfully with me; by the devil who is struggling at this moment with my good angel, I will bear myself to-day as I bore myself on that day, and if I no longer fight, I will at least continue to jest, and will laugh on to the end.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n At once his face became calm, as if all emotion had vanished from his heart; he passed his hand through his beautiful black hair, and walked up to Monsieur de La Rochefoucauld and Lenet with a smile upon his lips. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Messieurs,\" said he, \"as you know, one requires time to become accustomed to everything in this world, which is so filled with strange and unexpected events; I have taken, and I did wrong not to ask your leave to take, a moment to accustom myself to the thought of death; if it was too long a time, I ask your pardon for compelling you to wait.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Profound astonishment was depicted on the faces of all the bystanders, and the prisoner was aware that that feeling soon gave place to admiration; his strength was increased tenfold by his consciousness of that sentiment, so honorable to him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Whenever you are ready, messieurs,\" said he; \"I am waiting for you now.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The duke, dumbfounded for an instant, at once resumed his usual phlegmatic demeanor, and gave the signal. Thereupon the gates were opened and the procession made ready to set out. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"One moment,\" cried Lenet, to gain time; \"one moment, Monsieur le Duc! We are escorting Monsieur de Canolles to his death, are we not?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The duke made a gesture of surprise, and Canolles looked wonderingly at Lenet. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, yes,\" said the duke. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Very good!\" rejoined Lenet, \"in that case the gallant gentleman cannot do without a confessor.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Pardon me, pardon me, monsieur,\" interposed Canolles; \"I can do without one perfectly well.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How so?\" Lenet asked, making signs to the prisoner which he would not understand. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Because I am a Huguenot,\" replied Canolles, \"and a zealous Huguenot, too, I promise you. If you wish to confer one last favor upon me, I pray you let me die as I am.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Even as he repelled the suggestion, the young man made a gesture of gratitude, which proved that he perfectly understood Lenet\u0027s purpose. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If there is no further cause for delay, let us be off,\" said the duke. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Make him confess! make him confess!\" cried a few of the more vindictive bystanders. \\n\\n \\n\\n Canolles drew himself up to his full height, looked about him on all sides with a calm and confident glance, and said sternly to the duke:— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Are we going to act like cowards, monsieur? Me-thinks that if any person has the right to follow out his desires, I, who am the hero of the fête, have that right, I refuse to see a confessor, but I demand the scaffold, and that at the earliest possible moment; \u0027tis my turn to be weary of waiting.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Silence!\" cried the duke, turning to the crowd. When silence was restored in obedience to his potent voice and glance, he said to Canolles:— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Monsieur you may do as you choose.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Thanks, monsieur. In that case, let us go, and quickly; may we not?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Lenet took Canolles\u0027 arm. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"On the contrary, let us go slowly,\" said he. \"Who knows? A reprieve, an occurrence that we cannot fore-see, are among the possibilities. Go slowly, I implore you in the name of her who loves you, and who will weep so bitterly if we go too fast.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh! do not speak to me of her, I entreat; all my courage vanishes at the thought that I am to be parted forever from her. But what am I saying? On the other hand, Monsieur Lenet, do speak of her, tell me again and again that she loves me, and will always love me, and above all, that she will weep for me!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Come, come, my dear, unfortunate child,\" said Lenet, \"do not give way to your feelings; remember that these men are looking at you, and that they know not of whom we are speaking.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Canolles proudly raised his head, and his hair fell in wavy black curls about his neck. By this time they were in the street; the light of many torches shone upon his calm and smiling face. \\n\\n \\n\\n He could hear women weeping, and there were some who said:— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Poor baron, so young and so fair!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n They marched along for some time in silence; suddenly he exclaimed:— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh! Monsieur Lenet, I would that I might see her once more!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do you wish me to go in search of her, and bring her to you?\" asked Lenet, who had no longer any will of his own. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh! yes,\" whispered Canolles. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Very well! I will go; but you will kill her.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"So much the better!\" whispered selfishness to the young man\u0027s heart; \"if you kill her, she will never belong to another.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But he overcame this last weakness as suddenly as it assailed him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, no,\" said he, seizing Lenet\u0027s hand; \"you promised to remain with me, so remain.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What does he say?\" the duke inquired of the captain of the guards. \\n\\n \\n\\n Canolles overheard the question. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I was saying, Monsieur le Duc,\" said he, \"that I thought it was not so far from the prison to the Esplanade.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Alas!\" interposed Lenet, \"do not complain of the distance, my poor boy, for we have arrived.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n As he spoke the torch-bearers and the head of the procession disappeared around a street-corner. \\n\\n \\n\\n Lenet pressed the young man\u0027s hand, then went up to the duke, determined to make one last effort before they actually reached the place of execution. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Monsieur,\" said he, \"once more I implore you for mercy! you will ruin our cause by executing Monsieur de Canolles.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"On the contrary,\" retorted the duke, \"we prove that we deem it a just cause, as we do not fear to make reprisals.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But reprisals can only be made between equals, Monsieur le Duc, and whatever you may say, the queen will still be queen, and we her subjects.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Let us not discuss such matters before Monsieur de Canolles,\" rejoined the duke aloud; \"surely you can see the impropriety.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do not speak of mercy before Monsieur le Duc;\" retorted Canolles; \"surely you can see that his coup d\u0027état is in process of accomplishment; do not annoy him for so small a matter.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The duke made no reply; but his compressed lips and his ironical glance showed that the blow had struck home. Meanwhile they had not ceased to go forward, and Canolles now found himself at the entrance to the Esplanade. In the distance, that is, at the other side of the square, could be seen the crowd, in a vast circle formed by the glittering musket-barrels. In the centre arose a shapeless black something, which Canolles could not clearly distinguish in the shadow, and he thought that it was an ordinary scaffold. But when the torches reached the centre of the square, their light fell full upon that black object, at first unrecognizable, and revealed the hideous silhouette of a gibbet. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A gibbet!\" cried Canolles, halting, and pointing to the structure. \"Is not that a gibbet that I see yonder, Monsieur le Duc?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is; you are not mistaken,\" he replied, coldly. \\n\\n \\n\\n A wrathful flush reddened the young man\u0027s brow; he threw aside the two soldiers who were marching on either hand, and at one bound found himself face to face with Monsieur de La Rochefoucauld. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Monsieur,\" he cried, \"do you forget that I am of gentle blood? All the world knows, even the executioner himself, that a nobleman is entitled to be beheaded.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Monsieur, there are circumstances—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is not in my own name that I speak,\" Canolles interrupted, \"but in the name of all the nobility, in which you hold so high a place, who have been prince and are now duke; it will be a lasting shame, not for me, who am innocent, but for one and all of you, that one of your caste should die upon the gallows.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Monsieur, Richon was hanged by order of the king.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Richon, monsieur, was a gallant soldier, and at heart as noble as any man in this wide world, but he was not of noble birth; I am.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You forget,\" said the duke, \"that this is a matter of reprisals; were you a prince of the blood, we would hang you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Canolles instinctively put his hand to his side for his sword, but when he failed to find it there, the realization of his situation came over him once more in all its force; his wrath vanished, and he remembered that his real superiority lay in his very weakness. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Monsieur philosopher,\" said he, \"woe to those who resort to reprisals, and woe thrice over to those who, when they resort to them, lay aside all humanity! I did not plead for mercy, but justice. There are those who love me, monsieur; I emphasize the word, because I am aware that you yourself do not appreciate how one can love. Upon the hearts of those who love me you are about to impress forever, with the memory of my death, the dishonoring image of the gibbet. A sword-thrust, I beseech you, or a musket-ball! Give me your dagger that I may kill myself, and then you may hang my dead body if it will give you any pleasure.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Richon was hanged alive, monsieur,\" was the cold reply. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Be it so! Now, listen to what I say. Some day some frightful misfortune will overtake you; when that day comes, you will remember that it is punishment from on high: for my own part, I die with the firm conviction that my death is your work.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Thereupon Canolles, shuddering and pale, but filled with exalted courage, approached the gallows and stood, proud and disdainful, facing the populace, with his foot upon the first step of the ladder. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now, executioner,\" said he, \"do your duty.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There is only one!\" cried the crowd in amazement; \"the other! where is the other? we were promised two!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah! that is one thing that consoles me in a measure,\" said Canolles, with a smile; \"this amiable populace is not content with what you are doing for it; do you hear what it says, Monsieur le Duc?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Death! death! vengeance for Richon!\" roared ten thousand voices. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If I irritate them,\" thought Canolles, \"they are quite capable of tearing me in pieces; in that case I shall not be hanged, and Monsieur le Duc will go insane with rage. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You are cowards!\" he cried; \"I see some among you who took part in the attack on Saint-Georges, when I made you all run away! You are venting your spite on me to-day because I whipped you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A roar of rage was the only reply. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You are cowards!\" he repeated; \"rebels, villains!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A thousand knives gleamed in the air, and stones began to fall at the gallows foot. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Good!\" muttered Canolles. \"The king hanged Richon,\" he added aloud, \"and he did well; when he takes Bordeaux, he will hang many another—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n At these words the crowd rushed like a torrent toward the gallows, broke through the guards, overturned the palisades, and threw themselves, roaring like wild beasts, upon the prisoner. \\n\\n \\n\\n At a gesture from the duke, one of the executioners raised Canolles by taking him under the arms, while the other adjusted a noose around his neck. \\n\\n \\n\\n Canolles felt the cord and redoubled his taunts and insults; if he wished to be killed in time he had not a moment to lose. \\n\\n \\n\\n At that supreme moment he looked around for the last time; he could see naught but naming eyes and threatening arms. One man, however, a mounted soldier, pointed to his musket. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Cauvignac! \u0027tis Cauvignac!\" cried Canolles, clinging to the ladder with both his hands, which were not bound. \\n\\n \\n\\n Cauvignac made a motion indicating that he had been unable to save him, and levelled his weapon at him. Canolles understood him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, yes!\" he cried, emphasizing his words with his head. \\n\\n \\n\\n Now let us see how Cauvignac happened to be at hand. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1647/48687.html","bookId":1205,"book":{"id":1205,"title":"The War of Women Volume 2","description":"简介： Two days later they came in sight of Bordeaux, and it became necessary to decide at once how they should enter the city.
