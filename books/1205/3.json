{"id":19360,"no":3,"title":"THE VICOMTESSE DE CAMBES. III.","content":"The dining-hall was left untenanted, save by Canolles and the officer who announced the flag of truce, and who was still standing beside the door. \"What are Monsieur le Gouverneur\u0027s orders?\" he said, after a brief pause. Canolles, who was deep in thought, started at the voice, raised his head, and shook off his preoccupation. \"Where is the flag of truce?\" he asked. \"In the armory, monsieur.\" \"By whom is he accompanied?\" \"By two of the Bordeaux militia.\" \"What is he?\" \"A young man, so far as I can judge; he wears a broad-brimmed hat, and is wrapped in a great cloak.\" \"In what terms did he announce himself?\" \"As the bearer of letters from Madame la Princesse and the Parliament of Bordeaux.\" \"Request him to wait a moment,\" said Canolles, \"and I will be at his service.\" The officer left the room to perform his errand, and Canolles was preparing to follow him, when a door opened, and Nanon, pale and trembling, but with an affectionate smile upon her lips, made her appearance. \"A flag of truce, my dear,\" she said, grasping the young man\u0027s hand. \"What does it mean?\" \"It means, dear Nanon, that the good people of Bordeaux propose either to frighten me or seduce me.\" \"What have you decided?\" \"To receive him.\" \"Is there no way to avoid it?\" \"Impossible. It is one of the customs which must be followed.\" \"Oh! mon Dieu!\" \"What\u0027s the matter, Nanon?\" \"I\u0027m afraid—\" \"Of what?\" \"Didn\u0027t you say that the mission of this flag of truce was to frighten you or seduce you?\" \"Of course; a flag of truce is good for nothing else. Are you afraid he\u0027ll frighten me?\" \"Oh, no! but he may perhaps seduce you—\" \"You insult me, Nanon.\" \"Alas! my dear, I only say what I am afraid of—\" \"You distrust me to that extent? For what do you take me, pray?\" \"For what you are, Canolles; a noble heart, but easily moved.\" \"Well, well!\" laughed Canolles; \"in God\u0027s name, who is this flag of truce? Can it be Dan Cupid in person?\" \"Perhaps.\" \"Why, have you seen him?\" \"I haven\u0027t seen him, but I heard his voice. It\u0027s a very soft voice for a flag of truce.\" \"You are mad, Nanon! let me do my duty. It was you who made me governor.\" \"To defend me, my dear.\" \"Well, do you think me dastard enough to betray you? Really, Nanon, you insult me by placing so little confidence in me!\" \"You are determined, then, to see this young man?\" \"I must, and I shall take it very ill of you if you make any further objection to my fulfilling my duty in that respect.\" \"You are free to do as you please, my dear,\" said Nanon, sadly. \"One other word—\" \"Say it.\" \"Where shall you receive him?\" \"In my cabinet.\" \"Canolles, one favor—\" \"What is it?\" \"Receive him in your bedroom instead of your cabinet.\" \"What have you in your head?\" \"Don\u0027t you understand?\" \"No.\" \"My room opens into yours.\" \"And you will listen?\" \"Behind your bed-curtains, if you will allow me.\" \"Nanon!\" \"Let me be near you, dear. I have faith in my star; I shall bring you luck.\" \"But, Nanon, suppose this flag of truce—\" \"Well?\" \"Should have some State secret to tell me?\" \"Can you not intrust a State secret to her who has intrusted her life and her fortune to you?\" \"Very well! listen to us, Nanon, if you insist upon it; but don\u0027t detain me any longer; the messenger is waiting for me.\" \"Go, Canolles, go; but, first, accept my loving thanks for your kindness to me!\" And the young woman would have kissed her lover\u0027s hand. \"Foolish girl!\" said Canolles, pressing her to his heart and kissing her on the forehead; \"so you will be—\" \"Behind the curtains of your bed. There I can see and hear.\" \"Whatever else you do, don\u0027t laugh, Nanon, for these are serious matters.\" \"Have no fear,\" said Nanon. \"I won\u0027t laugh.\" Canolles ordered the messenger to be introduced, and passed into his own apartment, a room of great size, furnished under Charles IX. in a style of severe simplicity. Two candelabra were burning upon the chimney-piece, but their feeble glimmer was quite inadequate to light the immense apartment; the alcove at the farther end was entirely in shadow. \"Are you there, Nanon?\" Canolles asked. A stifled \"Yes\" reached his ears. At that moment he heard steps in the corridor. The sentinel presented arms; the messenger entered and followed his introducer with his eyes, until he was, or thought he was, alone with Canolles. Then he removed his hat and threw back his cloak; immediately a mass of blond locks fell down over a pair of shapely shoulders, the graceful, willowy form of a woman appeared under the gold baldric, and Canolles, by the sad, sweet expression of her face, recognized the Vicomtesse de Cambes. \"I told you that I would seek you,\" she said, \"and I keep my word; here I am.\" Canolles clasped his hands and fell upon a chair in speechless amazement, and an agony of fear. \"You! you!\" he muttered. \"Mon Dieu! why are you here; what seek you here?\" \"I have come to ask you, monsieur, if you still remember me.\" Canolles heaved a heart-breaking sigh, and put his hands before his eyes, seeking to banish the ravishing but fatal apparition. Everything was made clear to him in an instant; Nanon\u0027s alarm, her pallor, her trembling, and, above all, her desire to be present at the interview. Nanon, with the keen eyes of jealousy, had detected a woman in the flag of truce. \"I have come to ask you,\" continued Claire, \"if you are ready to carry out the engagement you entered into with me in the little room at Jaulnay,—to send your resignation to the queen, and enter the service of the princes.\" \"Oh! silence! silence!\" cried Canolles. Claire shuddered at the accent of utter dismay in the commandant\u0027s voice, and glanced uneasily about the room. \"Are we not alone here?\" she asked. \"We are, madame; but may not some one hear us through the walls?\" \"I thought that the walls of Fort Saint-Georges were more solid than that,\" said Claire with a smile. Canolles made no reply. \"I have come to ask you,\" Claire resumed, \"how it happens that I have heard nothing of you during the eight or ten days you have been here,—so that I should still know nothing as to who is governor of ?le Saint-Georges, had not chance, or public rumor, informed me that it is the man who swore to me, barely twelve days since, that his disgrace was the best of good fortune, since it enabled him to devote his arm, his courage, his life, to the party to which I belong.\" Nanon could not repress a movement, which made Canolles jump and Madame de Cambes turn her head. \"Pray, what was that?\" she demanded. \"Nothing,\" Canolles replied; \"one of the regular noises of this old room. There is no end to the dismal creaking and groaning here.\" \"If it is anything else,\" said Claire, laying her hand upon Canolles\u0027 arm, \"be frank with me, baron, for you must realize the importance of this interview between us, when I decided to come myself to seek you.\" Canolles wiped the perspiration from his brow, and tried to smile. \"Say on,\" said he. \"I reminded you a moment since of your promise, and asked you if you were ready to keep it.\" \"Alas, madame,\" said Canolles, \"it has become impossible.\" \"Why so?\" \"Because since that time many unforeseen events have happened, many ties which I thought broken forever have been formed anew; for the punishment which I knew I had merited, the queen has substituted a recompense of which I am unworthy; to-day I am united to her Majesty\u0027s party by—gratitude.\" A sigh floated out upon the air. Poor Nanon doubtless was expecting a different word from the one that ended the sentence. \"Say by ambition, Monsieur de Canolles, and I can understand it. You are nobly born; at twenty-eight you are made lieutenant-colonel, and governor of a fortress; it\u0027s all very fine, I know; but it is no more than the fitting reward of your merit, and Monsieur de Mazarin is not the only one who appreciates it.\" \"Madame,\" said Canolles, \"not another word, I beg.\" \"Pardon, monsieur,\" returned Claire, \"but on this occasion it is not the Vicomtesse de Cambes who speaks to you, but the envoy of Madame la Princesse, who is intrusted with a mission to you,—a mission which she must now fulfil.\" \"Speak, madame,\" said Canolles, with a sigh which was much like a groan. \"Very well! Madame la Princesse, being aware of the sentiments which you expressed, in the first place at Chantilly, and afterwards at Jaulnay, and being anxious to know to what party you really belong, determined to send you a flag of truce to make an attempt to secure the fortress; this attempt, which another messenger might have made with much less ceremony, perhaps, I undertook to make, thinking that I should have more chance of success, knowing, as I do, your secret thoughts on the subject.\" \"Thanks, madame,\" said Canolles, tearing his hair; for, during the short pauses in the dialogue, he could hear Nanon\u0027s heavy breathing. \"This is what I have to propose to you, monsieur, in the name of Madame la Princesse, let me add; for if it had been in my own name,\" continued Claire, with her charming smile, \"I should have reversed the order of the propositions.\" \"I am listening,\" said Canolles, in a dull voice. \"I propose that you surrender ?le Saint-Georges on one of the three conditions which I submit to your choice. The first is this,—and pray remember that it does not come from me: the sum of two hundred thousand livres—\" \"Oh, madame, go no further,\" said Canolles, trying to break off the interview at that point. \"I have been intrusted by the queen with the post of commandant at ?le Saint-Georges, and I will defend it to the death.\" \"Remember the past, monsieur,\" said Claire, sadly; \"that is not what you said to me at our last interview, when you proposed to abandon everything to follow me, when you had the pen already in your hand to offer your resignation to the persons for whom you propose to sacrifice your life to-day.\" \"I might have had that purpose, madame, when I was free to choose my own road; but to-day I am no longer free—\" \"You are no longer free!\" cried Claire, turning pale as death; \"how am I to understand that? What do you mean?\" \"I mean that I am in honor bound.\" \"Very well! then listen to my second proposition.\" \"To what end?\" said Canolles; \"have I not told you often enough, madame, that my resolution is immovable? So do not tempt me; you would do so to no purpose.\" \"Forgive me, monsieur,\" said Claire, \"but I, too, am intrusted with a mission, and I must go through with it to the end.\" \"Go on,\" murmured Canolles; \"but you are very cruel.\" \"Resign your command, and we will work upon your successor more effectively than upon you. In a year, in two years, you can take service under Monsieur le Prince with the rank of brigadier.\" Canolles sadly shook his head. \"Alas! madame,\" said he, \"why do you ask nothing of me but impossibilities?\" \"Do you make that answer to me?\" said Claire. \"Upon my soul, monsieur, I do not understand you. Weren\u0027t you on the point of signing your resignation once? Did you not say to her who was beside you at that time, listening to you with such delight, that you did it freely and from the bottom of your heart? Why, I pray to know, will you not do here, when I ask you, when I beg you to do it, the very thing that you proposed to do at Jaulnay?\" Every word entered poor Nanon\u0027s heart like a dagger-thrust, and Canolles seemed to share her agony. \"That which at that time was an act of trifling importance would to-day be treachery, infamous treachery!\" said Canolles, gloomily. \"I will never surrender ?le Saint-Georges, I will never resign my post!\" \"Stay, stay,\" said Claire in her sweetest voice, but looking about uneasily all the while; for Canolles\u0027 resistance, and, above all, the constraint under which he was evidently laboring seemed very strange to her. \"Listen now to my last proposition, with which I would have liked to begin, for I knew, and I said beforehand, that you would refuse the first two. Material advantages, and I am very happy to have divined it, are not the things which tempt a heart like yours. You must needs have other hopes than those of ambition and of fortune; noble instincts require noble rewards. Listen—\" \"In Heaven\u0027s name, madame,\" Canolles broke in, \"have pity on me!\" And he made as if he would withdraw. Claire thought that his resolution was shaken, and, confident that what she was about to say would complete her victory, she detained him, and continued:— \"If, instead of a mere mercenary recompense, you were offered a pure and honorable recompense; if your resignation were to be purchased,—and you can resign without blame, for, as hostilities have not begun, it would be neither defection nor treachery, but a matter of choice, pure and simple,—if, I say, your resignation were to be purchased by an alliance; if a woman, to whom you have said that you loved her, whom you have sworn always to love, and who, notwithstanding your oaths, has never responded directly to your passion, if that woman should come to you and say: \u0027Monsieur de Canolles, I am free, I am wealthy, I love you; be my husband, let us go hence together,—go wherever you choose, away from all these civil commotions, away from France,\u0027—tell me, monsieur, would you not then accept?\" Canolles, despite Claire\u0027s blushes, despite her fascinating hesitation, despite the memory of the lovely little chateau de Cambes, which he could have seen from his window, had not the darkness come down from heaven during the scene we have been describing,—Canolles remained firm and immovable in his determination; for he could see in the distance, a white spot in the deep shadow, the pale, tear-stained face of Nanon, trembling with agony, peering out from behind the Gothic curtains. \"Answer me, in Heaven\u0027s name!\" exclaimed the viscountess, \"for I am at a loss to understand your silence. Am I mistaken? Are you not Monsieur le Baron de Canolles? Are you not the same man who told me at Chantilly that you loved me, and who repeated it at Jaulnay,—who swore that you loved me alone in all the world, and that you were ready to sacrifice every other love to me? Answer! answer! in Heaven\u0027s name, answer!\" A moan came from behind the curtains, this time so distinct and unmistakable that Madame de Cambes could no longer doubt that a third person was present at the interview; her frightened eyes followed the direction taken by Canolles\u0027 eyes, and he could not look away so quickly that the viscountess did not catch a glimpse of that pale, immovable face, that form like the form of a ghost, which followed, with breathless interest, every word that was uttered. The two women exchanged a glance of flame through the darkness, and each of them uttered a shriek. Nanon disappeared. Madame de Cambes hastily seized her hat and cloak, and said, turning to Canolles:— \"Monsieur, I understand now what you mean by duty and gratitude. I understand what duty it is that you refuse to abandon or betray; I understand, in short, that there are affections utterly impervious to all seduction, and I leave you to those affections and to that duty and gratitude. Adieu, monsieur, adieu!\" She started toward the door, nor did Canolles, attempt to detain her; but a painful memory stopped her. \"Once more, monsieur,\" said she, \"in the name of the friendship that I owe you for the service you were pleased to render me, in the name of the friendship that you owe me for the service I rendered you, in the name of all those who love you and whom you love—and I except not one—do not engage in this struggle; to-morrow, day after to-morrow, perhaps, you will be attacked at Saint-Georges; do not cause me the bitter pain of knowing that you are either conquered or dead.\" At the words the young man started and came to himself. \"Madame,\" said he, \"I thank you on my knees for the assurance you give me of your friendship, which is more precious to me than I can tell you. Oh! let them come and attack me! Mon Dieu! let them come on! I look for the enemy with more ardor than will ever impel him to come to me. I feel the need of fighting, I feel the need of danger to raise me in my own esteem; let the struggle come, and the danger that attends it, aye, death itself! death will be welcome since I know that I shall die rich in your friendship, strong in your compassion, and honored by your esteem.\" \"Adieu, monsieur,\" said Claire, walking toward the door. Canolles followed her. In the middle of the dark corridor he seized her hand, and said, in so low a tone that he himself could hardly hear the words he uttered:— \"Claire, I love you more than I have ever loved you; but it is my misfortune that I can prove my love only by dying far away from you.\" A little ironical laugh was Claire\u0027s only reply; but no sooner was she out of the chateau than a pitiful sob burst from her throat, and she wrung her hands, crying:— \"Ah! my God, he doesn\u0027t love me! he doesn\u0027t love me! And I, poor miserable wretch that I am, do love him!\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1647/48664.html","bookId":1205,"book":{"id":1205,"title":"The War of Women Volume 2","description":"简介： Two days later they came in sight of Bordeaux, and it became necessary to decide at once how they should enter the city.
