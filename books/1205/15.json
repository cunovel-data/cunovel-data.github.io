{"id":19372,"no":15,"title":"THE VICOMTESSE DE CAMBES.XV.","content":"About a hundred men of the king\u0027s household crossed the Dordogne with their Majesties; the others remained with Monsieur de La Meilleraie, who, having decided to besiege Vayres, was awaiting the arrival of the army. \\n\\n \\n\\n The queen was no sooner installed in the little house—which, thanks to Nanon\u0027s luxurious tastes, she found infinitely more habitable than she anticipated—than Guitaut waited upon her to say that an officer, who claimed to have important matters to discuss with her, requested the honor of an audience. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Who is the man?\" demanded the queen. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Captain Cauvignac, madame.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is he of my army?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I do not think it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ascertain that fact, and if he is not of my army, say that I cannot receive him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I crave your Majesty\u0027s pardon for venturing to differ with you on that point,\" said Mazarin, \"but it seems to me that if he is not of your army, that is the very best of reasons for receiving him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why so?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Because, if he is of your Majesty\u0027s army, and seeks an audience, he cannot be other than a faithful subject; whereas, if he belongs to the enemy\u0027s army, he may be a traitor. At this moment, madame, traitors are not to be despised, for they may be extremely useful.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Admit him,\" said the queen, \"since Monsieur le Cardinal so advises.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The captain was at once introduced, and presented himself with an easy and assured demeanor which amazed the queen, accustomed as she was to produce a far different effect upon all who approached her. \\n\\n \\n\\n She eyed Cauvignac from head to foot, but he sustained the royal scrutiny with marvellous self-possession. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Who are you, monsieur?\" said she. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Captain Cauvignac,\" was the reply. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"In whose service are you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am in your Majesty\u0027s service, if such be your pleasure.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If such be my pleasure? Surely! Indeed, is there any other service in the kingdom? Are there two queens in France?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Assuredly not, madame; there is but one queen in France, and she it is at whose feet I have the honor to lay my most humble respect; but there are two contrary opinions in France,—at least, I thought as much just now.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What mean you, sirrah?\" demanded the queen, with a frown. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I mean, madame, that I was riding about in this vicinity, and as I happened to be upon the summit of a slight eminence which overlooks the whole country-side, admiring the landscape, which, as your Majesty must have noticed, is surpassingly beautiful, I thought I saw that Monsieur Richon did not receive your Majesty with all the respect to which you are entitled; that fact confirmed a suspicion I had previously entertained, namely, that there are two ways of thinking in France, the royalist way and another, and that Monsieur Richon is of that other way of thinking.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Anne of Austria\u0027s brow grew darker and darker. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah! you thought you saw that?\" said she. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, madame,\" Cauvignac replied with the most innocent candor. \"I even thought that I saw that a cannon was fired from the fort, and that the ball with which it was loaded had something to say to your Majesty\u0027s carriage.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Enough. Did you seek audience of me, monsieur, only to indulge in such absurd remarks as these?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah! you are discourteous,\" was Cauvignac\u0027s mental reflection; \"you shall pay the dearer for that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, madame, I sought an audience to say to you that you are a very great queen, and that my admiration for you knows no bounds.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Indeed!\" said the queen, dryly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Because of your grandeur, and my admiration, which is its natural consequence, I resolved to devote myself heart and soul to your Majesty\u0027s cause.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Thanks,\" said the queen, ironically. \"Guitaut,\" she added, turning to the captain of the guards, \"show this prating fool the door.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Pardon, madame,\" said Cauvignac, \"I will go without being driven out; but if I go you will not have Vayres.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Whereupon he saluted her Majesty with perfect grace, and turned upon his heel. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Madame,\" said Mazarin, in an undertone, \"I think that you are ill-advised to send this man away.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Stay a moment,\" said the queen, \"and say what you have to say; after all, you are a strange fellow, and most amusing.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Your Majesty is very kind,\" said Cauvignac, bowing low. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What were you saying about obtaining possession of Vayres?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I was saying that if your Majesty still entertains the purpose, which I fancied I detected this morning, of gaining admission to Vayres, I will make it my duty to show you the way in.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How so?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have a hundred and fifty men of my own at Vayres.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of your own?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, of my own.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Even so?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I turn over those one hundred and fifty men to your Majesty.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What then?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What then?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, then, it seems to me that the devil\u0027s in it if with a hundred and fifty doorkeepers your Majesty cannot cause a door to be opened.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027T is a witty knave,\" said the queen, with a smile. \\n\\n \\n\\n Cauvignac evidently guessed that a compliment was intended, for he bowed a second time. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What is your price, monsieur?\" she asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh! mon Dieu, madame!—five hundred livres for each doorkeeper; those are the wages I pay my men.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You shall have them.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And for myself?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah! you must have something for yourself also?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I should be proud to hold a commission by virtue of your Majesty\u0027s munificence.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What rank do you demand?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I should love to be governor of Braune. I have always longed to be a governor.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Granted.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"In that case, save for a trifling formality, the bargain is concluded.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What is that formality?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Will your Majesty deign to sign this bit of paper, which I prepared in advance, hoping that my services would be acceptable to my magnanimous sovereign?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What is the paper?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Read it, madame.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n With a graceful movement of his arm, and bending his knee with the utmost deference, Cauvignac presented a paper to the queen, who read as follows:— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027On the day that I enter Vayres, without striking a blow, I will pay to Captain Cauvignac the sum of seventy-five thousand livres, and will make him governor of Braune.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And so,\" the queen continued, restraining her indignation, \"Captain Cauvignac has not sufficient confidence in our royal word, but demands a written promise!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"In matters of importance, madame, a written promise seems to me most desirable,\" rejoined Cauvignac, with a bow. \u0027Verba volant,\u0027 says an old proverb; \u0027words fly away,\u0027 and, saving your Majesty\u0027s presence, I have been robbed.\"[1] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Insolent knave!\" exclaimed the queen, \"begone!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I go,\" said Cauvignac, \"but you will not have Vayres.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Again the captain turned upon his heel and walked toward the door; and Anne of Austria, whose irritation was far deeper than before, did not recall him. \\n\\n \\n\\n Cauvignac left the room. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"See to it that that man is secured,\" said the queen. \\n\\n \\n\\n Guitaut started to execute the order. \\n\\n \\n\\n [1] There is a play upon words here which cannot be reproduced in a translation,—the same French word, voler, meaning to fly, and to steal or rob. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Pardon, madame,\" said Mazarin, \"but I think that your Majesty is wrong to yield to an angry impulse.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why so?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But I fear that we may need this man later, and that, if your Majesty molests him in any way, you will then have to pay double for his services.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Very well,\" said the queen, \"we will pay him what we must; but meanwhile let him be kept in sight.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh! that\u0027s another matter, and I am the first to approve that precaution.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Guitaut, see what becomes of him,\" said the queen. \\n\\n \\n\\n Guitaut went out, and returned half an hour later. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well! what has become of him?\" the queen demanded. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Your Majesty may be perfectly easy in your mind, for your man shows not the least inclination to leave the neighborhood. I made inquiries, and found that he is domiciled at the inn of one Biscarros, within three hundred yards of this house.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And has he gone thither?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, madame; he had gone to the top of a hill near by, and is watching Monsieur de La Meilleraie\u0027s preparations for forcing the intrenchments. That spectacle seems to possess great interest for him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What of the rest of the army?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is coming up, madame, and drawing up in line of battle as fast as it arrives.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"In that case the marshal proposes to attack at once?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"In my opinion, madame, it would be much better to give the troops a night\u0027s rest before risking an attack.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A night\u0027s rest!\" cried the queen; \"the royal army to be delayed a night and day by such a paltry affair as this! Impossible! Guitaut, go and order the marshal to attack the fort at once. The king proposes to lie tonight at Vayres.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But, madame,\" murmured Mazarin, \"it seems to me that the marshal\u0027s precaution—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And it seems to me,\" retorted Anne of Austria, \"that when the royal authority has been outraged, it cannot be avenged too swiftly. Go, Guitaut, and say to Monsieur de La Meilleraie that the queen\u0027s eye is upon him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Dismissing Guitaut with a majestic gesture, the queen took her son by the hand and left the room; and, without looking to see if she was followed, ascended a staircase leading to a terrace. This terrace commanded a view of the surrounding country by means of vistas most artfully designed. \\n\\n \\n\\n The queen cast a rapid glance in every direction. Two hundred yards behind her was the Libourne road, with the hostelry of our friend Biscarros gleaming white in the sunlight. At her feet flowed the Dordogne, calm, swift, and majestic. At her right arose the fort of Vayres, silent as a ruin; the redoubts newly thrown up formed a circle around it. A few sentinels were pacing back and forth upon the gallery; five pieces of cannon showed their bronze necks and yawning mouths through the embrasures. At her left Monsieur de La Meilleraie was making his dispositions to camp for the night. The main body of the army had arrived and was drawn up in close order around the marshal\u0027s position. \\n\\n \\n\\n Upon a hillock stood a man following attentively with his eyes every movement of besiegers and besieged; it was Cauvignac. \\n\\n \\n\\n Guitaut crossed the river on the ferry-boat. \\n\\n \\n\\n The queen stood like a statue upon the terrace, with contracted brow, holding the hand of little Louis XIV., who gazed on the scene before him with an interest beyond his years, and from time to time said to his mother: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Madame, please let me mount my battle-horse, and go with Monsieur de La Meilleraie to punish these insolent fellows.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n At the queen\u0027s side was Mazarin, whose crafty, mocking features had assumed for the moment that cast of serious thought which they wore on great occasions only; and behind the queen and the minister were the maids of honor, who took pattern by their mistress\u0027s silence, and hardly dared exchange a few hurried words in undertones. \\n\\n \\n\\n In all this there was an appearance of peace and tranquillity; but it was the tranquillity of the mine, which a spark is soon to change into a destructive tempest. \\n\\n \\n\\n The eyes of all were fixed with special intentness upon Guitaut, for from him was to come the explosion which was awaited with such diverse emotions. \\n\\n \\n\\n The army likewise was in a state of painful suspense; and the messenger had no sooner stepped ashore upon the left bank of the Dordogne and been recognized than every eye was turned upon him. Monsieur de La Meilleraie, as soon as he caught sight of him, left the group of officers in the centre of which he was standing, and went to meet him. \\n\\n \\n\\n Guitaut and the marshal talked together for a few seconds. Although the river was quite wide at that point, and although the distance was considerable between the royal party and the two officers, it was not so great that the surprised expression upon the marshal\u0027s face could not be detected. It was evident that the order conveyed to him seemed ill-advised and unseasonable, and he looked doubtfully toward the group in which the queen could be distinguished. But Anne of Austria, who understood his thought, made so imperative a gesture with both head and hand that the marshal, who knew his imperious sovereign of old, bent his head in token of acquiescence, if not of approbation. \\n\\n \\n\\n Instantly, at a word from him, three or four captains, who exercised the functions of aides-de-camp of the present day, leaped into the saddle and galloped away in three or four different directions. Wherever they went the work of pitching the camp, which had just been begun, was at once broken off, and at the beat of the drums and the shrill call of the bugles, the soldiers let fall the armfuls of straw they were carrying, and the hammers with which they were driving in the tent-stakes. All ran to their weapons, which were stacked in due order; the grenadiers seized their muskets, the common soldiers their pikes, the artillerymen their various instruments; for a moment there was incredible confusion, caused by all these men running in all directions; but gradually order succeeded chaos, and every man was in his proper place,—the grenadiers in the centre, the king\u0027s household on the right, the artillery on the left; the drums and trumpets were silent. \\n\\n \\n\\n A single drum was heard behind the intrenchments; then it too ceased and deathlike silence prevailed. \\n\\n \\n\\n Suddenly an order was given in a clear, sharp tone. The queen was too far away to hear the words, but she saw the troops form instantly in columns; she drew her handkerchief and waved it, while the young king cried excitedly, stamping upon the ground: \"Forward! forward!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The army replied with a shout of \"Vive le roi!\" The artillery set off at a gallop, and took up its position upon a slight elevation, and the columns moved forward as the drums beat the charge. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was not a siege in regular form, but a simple escalade. The intrenchments thrown up in haste by Richon were earthworks; there were no trenches to be opened therefore,—it was a matter of carrying them by assault. Every precaution had been taken by the energetic commandant of Vayres, and he had availed himself of every possible advantage in the lay of the land, with unusual science. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was clear that Richon had determined not to fire first under any circumstances, for again he waited for the provocation to come from the king\u0027s troops; but again, as on the former occasion, that terrible row of muskets, which had done such execution upon the king\u0027s household, was seen to be pointing down at them. \\n\\n \\n\\n As the forward movement began, the six guns drawn up on the little hill were discharged, and the cannon-balls threw up showers of dirt on the crown of the ramparts. \\n\\n \\n\\n The response was not long delayed; the artillery within the intrenchments roared forth in its turn, ploughing broad furrows in the ranks of the royal army; but at the voice of the officers, these bleeding gaps disappeared; the lips of the wound opened for an instant, then closed again; the main column, which was momentarily shaken, moved forward once more. \\n\\n \\n\\n While the cannon were being reloaded it was the turn of the musketry. \\n\\n \\n\\n Five minutes later, the great guns on both sides discharged their volleys again, with but a single report, like two tempests in fierce combat with each other, like two peals of thunder coming at the same instant. \\n\\n \\n\\n As it was perfectly calm, and a dense smoke hung over the battle-field, besiegers and besieged soon disappeared in a cloud, which was rent from time to time by the vivid flash of the artillery. \\n\\n \\n\\n From time to time men could be seen coming out from the cloud in the rear of the royal army, dragging themselves along with difficulty, and leaving a bloody track behind them, until they fell exhausted. \\n\\n \\n\\n The number of wounded rapidly increased, and the roar of the musketry and artillery continued. The royal artillery, however, were firing irregularly and at random; for amid the dense smoke the gunners could not distinguish friends from foes. The gunners in the fort on the other hand had none but foes in front of them, and their fire was more constant and more deadly than ever. \\n\\n \\n\\n At last the royal artillery ceased firing altogether; it was evident that the assault had begun in good earnest, and that a hand-to-hand combat was in progress. \\n\\n \\n\\n There was a moment of keenest anxiety on the part of the spectators, during which the smoke, the firing having greatly slackened, rose slowly into the air. The royal army was then seen to be falling back in disorder, leaving heaps of dead at the foot of the ramparts. A sort of breach had been made; a few palisades were torn away, leaving an opening; but that opening bristled with men and pikes and muskets, and amid those men, covered with blood, and yet as calm and cool as if he were a disinterested spectator of the tragedy in which he was playing so terrible a part, stood Richon, holding in his hand an axe all notched by the blows he had struck with it. \\n\\n \\n\\n Some invisible power seemed to protect him, for he was constantly in the thickest of the firing, always in the front rank, always standing erect and with uncovered head, and yet no bullet had struck him, no pike had touched him; he was as invulnerable as he was impassive. \\n\\n \\n\\n Thrice Maréchal de La Meilleraie in person led the royal troops to the assault; thrice the royal troops were beaten back before the eyes of the king and queen. \\n\\n \\n\\n Great tears rolled silently down the pale cheeks of the boy king; Anne of Austria wrung her hands and muttered:— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh! that man! that man! If he ever falls into my hands I will make a terrible example of him!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Luckily flight was close at hand, and spread a veil, so to speak, over the royal blushes. Maréchal de La Meilleraie ordered the bugles to blow the recall. \\n\\n \\n\\n Cauvignac left his post, descended the hill, and sauntered across the field toward the hostelry of Master Biscarros, with his hands in his pockets. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Madame,\" said Mazarin, waving his hand in Cauvignac\u0027s direction, \"there\u0027s a man who for a little gold would have spared you all this bloodshed.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nonsense!\" said the queen. \"Monsieur le Cardinal, that is strange language for an economical man like yourself.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"True, madame,\" rejoined the cardinal: \"I know the value of gold, but I know the value of blood also; and at this moment blood is more valuable to us than gold.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Be assured,\" said the queen, \"that the blood that has been shed shall be avenged. Comminges,\" she added, addressing the lieutenant of her guards, \"seek out Monsieur de La Meilleraie and bring him to me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Bernouin,\" said the Cardinal to his valet, pointing to Cauvignac, who was within a few steps of the Golden Calf, \"do you see that man?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, monseigneur.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Very good! go to him from me, and bring him secretly to my room to-night.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1647/48676.html","bookId":1205,"book":{"id":1205,"title":"The War of Women Volume 2","description":"简介： Two days later they came in sight of Bordeaux, and it became necessary to decide at once how they should enter the city.
