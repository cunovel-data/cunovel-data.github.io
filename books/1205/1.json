The dukes, with their army, were no more than ten leagues away, so that they were at liberty to choose between a peaceable and a forcible entry. The important question to be decided was whether it was better to have immediate possession of Bordeaux at all hazards, or to comply with the wishes of the Parliament. Madame la Princesse summoned her council of war, which consisted of Madame de Tourville, Claire, Lenet, and her maids of honor. Madame de Tourville knew her arch antagonist so well that she had persistently opposed his admission to the council, upon the ground that the war was a war of women, in which men were to be used only to do the fighting. But Madame la Princesse declared that as Lenet was saddled upon her by her husband, she could not exclude him from the deliberative chamber, where, after all, his presence would amount to nothing, as it was agreed beforehand that he might talk all he chose, but that they would not listen to him. \n \n Madame de Tourville\u0027s precautions were by no means uncalled-for; she had employed the two days that had just passed in bringing Madame la Princesse around to the bellicose ideas which she was only too anxious to adopt, and she feared that Lenet would destroy the whole structure that she had erected with such infinite pains. \n \n When the council was assembled, Madame de Tourville set forth her plan. She proposed that the dukes should come up secretly with their army, that they should procure, by force or by persuasion, a goodly number of boats, and go down the river into Bordeaux, shouting: \"Vive Condé! Down with Mazarin!\" \n \n In this way Madame la Princesse\u0027s entry would assume the proportions of a veritable triumph, and Madame de Tourville, by a détour, would accomplish her famous project of taking forcible possession of Bordeaux, and thus inspiring the queen with a wholesome terror of an army whose opening move resulted so brilliantly. \n \n Lenet nodded approval of everything, interrupting Madame de Tourville with admiring exclamations. When she had completed the exposition of her plan, he said:— \n \n \"Magnificent, madame! be good enough now to sum up your conclusions.\" \n \n \"That I can do very easily, in two words,\" said the good woman, triumphantly, warming up at the sound of her own voice. \"Amid the hail-storm of bullets, the clanging of bells, and the cries, whether of rage or affection, of the people, a handful of weak women will be seen, intrepidly fulfilling their noble mission; a child in its mother\u0027s arms will appeal to the Parliament for protection. This touching spectacle cannot fail to move the most savage hearts. Thus we shall conquer, partly by force, partly by the justice of our cause; and that, I think, is Madame la Princesse\u0027s object.\" \n \n The summing up aroused even more enthusiasm than the original speech. Madame la Princesse applauded; Claire, whose desire to be sent with a flag of truce to ?le Saint-Georges became more and more earnest, applauded; the captain of the guards, whose business it was to thirst for battle, applauded; and Lenet did more than applaud; he took Madame de Tourville\u0027s hand, and pressed it with no less respect than emotion. \n \n \"Madame,\" he cried, \"even if I had not known how great is your prudence, and how thoroughly you are acquainted, both by intuition and study, with the great civil and military question which engages our attention, I should assuredly be convinced of it now, and should prostrate myself before the most useful adviser that her Highness could hope to find.\" \n \n \"Is she not?\" said the princess; \"isn\u0027t it a fine scheme, Lenet? I agree with her entirely. Come, Vialas, give Monsieur le Duc d\u0027Enghien the little sword I had made for him, and his helmet and coat of mail.\" \n \n \"Yes! do so, Vialas. But a single word first, by your leave, madame,\" said Lenet; while Madame de Tourville, who was all swollen up with pride, began to lose confidence, in view of her vivid remembrance of the subtle arguments with which Lenet was accustomed to combat her plans. \n \n \"Well,\" said the princess, \"what is it now?\" \n \n \"Nothing, madame, nothing at all; for no plan could be proposed more in harmony with the character of an august princess like yourself, and it could only emanate from your household.\" \n \n These words caused Madame de Tourville to puff out anew, and brought back the smile to the lips of Madame la Princesse, who was beginning to frown. \n \n \"But, madame,\" pursued Lenet, watching the effect of this terrible but upon the face of his sworn foe, \"while I adopt, I will not say simply without repugnance, but with enthusiasm, this plan, which seems to me the only available one, I will venture to propose a slight modification.\" \n \n Madame de Tourville stiffened up, and prepared for defence. Madame la Princesse\u0027s smile disappeared. \n \n Lenet bowed and made a motion with his hand as if asking permission to continue. \n \n \"My heart is filled with a joy I cannot express,\" he said, \"in anticipation of the clanging of the bells, and the joyous acclamations of the people. But I haven\u0027t the confidence I would like to have in the hail-storm of bullets to which Madame has referred.\" \n \n Madame de Tourville assumed a martial air. Lenet bowed even lower than before, and continued, lowering his voice a half-tone:— \n \n \"Assuredly it would be a grand spectacle to see a woman and her child walking calmly along in the midst of a tempest which would terrify most men. But I should fear that one of those same bullets, following a blind impulse, as brutal, unintelligent things are wont to do, might give Monsieur de Mazarin the advantage over us, and spoil our plan, which is so magnificent in other respects. I am of the opinion, expressed so eloquently by Madame de Tourville, that the young prince and his august mother should open up the way to the Parliament-house for us,—but by petition, not by arms. I think, in short, that it will be much better to move in that way the most savage hearts, than to conquer by other means the most valiant. I think that the former of these methods presents infinitely more chances of success, and that the object of Madame la Princesse is, before all else, to gain admission to Bordeaux. Now, I say that nothing is less sure than our success in gaining admission to Bordeaux, if we take the chances of a battle.\" \n \n \"You see,\" said Madame de Tourville, sourly, \"that monsieur proposes, as usual, to demolish my plan, bit by bit, and quietly substitute a plan of his own therefor.\" \n \n \"I!\" cried Lenet, while the princess reassured Madame de Tourville with a smile and a glance,—\"I, the most enthusiastic of your admirers! no, a thousand times no! But I say that an officer in his Majesty\u0027s service named Dalvimar has arrived in the city from Blaye, whose mission is to arouse the officials and the people against her Highness. And I say that if Monsieur de Mazarin can put an end to the war at a single blow he will do it; that is why I fear Madame de Tourville\u0027s hail-storm of bullets, the more intelligent ones even more perhaps than the brutal, unreasoning ones.\" \n \n This last argument seemed to make Madame la Princesse reflect. \n \n \"You always know everything, Monsieur Lenet,\" retorted Madame de Tourville, in a voice trembling with wrath. \n \n \"A good hot action would be a fine thing, however,\" said the captain of the guards, drawing himself up and marking time with his foot as if he were on the parade ground; he was an old soldier, whose sole reliance was upon force, and who would have shone in action. \n \n Lenet trod upon his foot, looking at him the while with a most amiable smile. \n \n \"Yes, captain,\" said he; \"but do you not think also that Monsieur le Duc d\u0027Enghien is necessary to our cause, and that with him dead or a prisoner we are deprived of the real generalissimo of our armies?\" \n \n The captain of the guards, who knew that to bestow this pompous title of generalissimo upon a prince of seven years made himself, in reality, the commander-in-chief of the army, realized what a fool he had made of himself, and warmly supported Lenet\u0027s opinion. \n \n Meanwhile Madame de Tourville had gone to the princess\u0027s side and was talking with her in an undertone. Lenet saw that the battle was not yet won; indeed, the next moment her Highness turned to him and said, testily:— \n \n \"It is very strange that you should be so bent upon demolishing what was so well constructed.\" \n \n \"Your Highness is in error,\" said Lenet. \"I have never been persistent in offering such advice as I have had the honor to give you, and, if I demolish, it is with the intention of rebuilding. If, notwithstanding the arguments I have had the honor to submit to you, your Highness still desires to seek death with your son, you are at liberty to do so, and we will face death at your side; that is a very simple thing to do, and the first footman in your retinue, or the meanest scoundrel in the city will do as much. But if we wish to succeed, despite Mazarin, despite the queen, despite the Parliament, despite Mademoiselle Nanon de Lartigues, despite all the disadvantages inseparable from the feeble state to which we are reduced, this, in my opinion, is what we must do.\" \n \n \"Monsieur,\" cried Madame de Tourville, impetuously, catching Lenet\u0027s last sentence on the rebound, \"there is no such thing as weakness, where we have on the one hand the name of Condé, and on the other two thousand of the men of Rocroy, Nordlingen, and Lens; and if we are weak under such circumstances, why, we are lost in any event, and no plan of yours, however magnificent it may be, will save us.\" \n \n \"I have read, madame,\" rejoined Lenet, calmly, enjoying in anticipation the effect of what he was about to say upon the princess, who was listening attentively in spite of herself,—\"I have read that, in the reign of Tiberius, the widow of one of the most illustrious Romans, the noble-hearted Agrippina, who had been bereft of her husband Germanicus by persecution, a princess who could at will arouse to frenzy a whole army devoted to the memory of their dead general, preferred to enter Brundisium alone, to traverse Puglia and Campania clad in mourning, holding a child by each hand, pale-cheeked, eyes red with tears and bent upon the ground, while the children sobbed and gazed imploringly around; whereat all who saw—and from Brundisium to Rome there were above two million people—burst into tears, broke forth in threats and imprecations, and her cause was won, not at Rome alone, but before all Italy; not only in the judgment of her contemporaries, but in that of posterity; for she met with no shadow of resistance to her tears and lamentations, while lances would have been met with pikes, and swords with swords. To my mind there is a very strong resemblance between her Highness and Agrippina, between Monsieur le Prince and Germanicus, between Piso, the persecuting minister and poisoner, and Monsieur de Mazarin. With this strong resemblance between the personages concerned, the situation being almost identical, I ask that the same line of conduct be adopted; for, in my opinion, it is impossible that what succeeded so perfectly at one time could fail at another.\" \n \n An approving smile played about Madame la Princesse\u0027s lips, and assured Lenet that his discourse had turned the tide of battle in his favor. Madame de Tourville took refuge in a corner of the room, veiling herself like an antique statue. Madame de Cambes, who had found a friend in Lenet, repaid him for his support in another matter, by nodding her head approvingly; the captain of the guards wept like a military tribune, and the little Duc d\u0027Enghien cried:— \n \n \"Mamma, will you hold my hand, and dress me in mourning?\" \n \n \"Yes, my son,\" the princess replied. \"You know, Lenet, that it has always been my intention to present myself to the people of Bordeaux dressed in black.\" \n \n \"Especially,\" said Madame de Cambes, \"as black is so wondrously becoming to your Highness,\" \n \n \"Hush! little one,\" said the princess; \"Madame de Tourville will cry it loud enough, without your saying it, even in a whisper.\" \n \n The programme for the entry into Bordeaux was arranged according to Lenet\u0027s suggestions. The ladies of the escort were ordered to make their preparations. The young prince was dressed in a suit of white, trimmed with black and silver lace, and wore a hat with black and white plumes. \n \n The princess herself was arrayed with an affectation of the greatest simplicity. In order to resemble Agrippina, by whom she was determined to take pattern in every respect, she wore plain black with no jewels of any sort. \n \n Lenet, as the architect of the fête, exerted himself to the utmost to make it magnificent. The house in which he lived, in a small town some two leagues from Bordeaux, was constantly filled with partisans of Madame la Princesse, who were anxious to know, before she entered the city, what sort of entry would be most agreeable to her. Lenet, like a modern theatrical manager, suggested flowers, acclamations, and the ringing of bells; and, wishing to afford some satisfaction to the bellicose Madame de Tourville, he proposed that the princess should receive an artillery salute. \n \n On the following day, May 31st, at the invitation of the Parliament, the princess set out for the city. One Lavie, avocat-général of Parliament, and a zealous partisan of Monsieur de Mazarin, had ordered the gates closed the night before, to prevent the entrance of the princess if she should present herself. But, on the other hand, the partisans of the Condés were not idle, and early in the morning the people, at their instigation, assembled in crowds amid shouts of, \"Vive Madame la Princesse! Vive Monsieur le Duc d\u0027Enghien!\" and cut down the gates with axes; so that there was, finally, no opposition to this famous entry, which assumed the character of a triumph. Interested observers could estimate from these two occurrences the relative power of the leaders of the two factions which divided the city, for Lavie was acting directly under the advice of the Duc d\u0027épernon, while the leaders of the people were advised by Lenet. \n \n The princess had no sooner passed through the gate than the scene which had been long in preparation was enacted upon a gigantic scale. A salute was fired by the vessels in the harbor, and the guns of the city replied. Plowers fell in showers from the windows, and were stretched in festoons across the street, so that the pavements were strewn with them and the air laden with their perfume. Loud acclamations arose from the lips of thirty thousand zealots of all ages and both sexes, whose enthusiasm increased with the interest inspired by Madame la Princesse and her son, and with their hatred for Mazarin. \n \n However, the Duc d\u0027Enghien was the cleverest actor in all the cast. Madame la Princesse gave up leading him by the hand, either because she feared to weary him, or so that he might not be buried under the roses; he was carried by his gentleman-in-waiting, so that his hands were free, and he sent kisses to right and left, and waved his plumed hat gracefully to the spectators. \n \n The good people of Bordeaux are easily excited; the women soon reached a condition of frenzied adoration for the lovely child who wept so charmingly, and the old magistrates were moved to tears by the words of the little orator, who said: \"Messieurs, take my father\u0027s place, for Monsieur le Cardinal has taken him away from me.\" \n \n In vain did the partisans of the minister attempt to make some opposition; fists, stones, and even halberds enjoined discretion upon them, and they had no choice but to leave the triumphant rebels a clear field. \n \n Meanwhile Madame de Cambes, with pale and serious face, drew the attention of many in the crowd as she walked along behind Madame la Princesse. As she reflected upon the glorious success of the day, she could not avoid the fear that it might bring forgetfulness of the resolution of the preceding day. She was walking along, as we have said, hustled and crowded by the adoring people, inundated with flowers and respectful caresses, shuddering with the fear of being taken up and carried in triumph, a fate with which some voices began to threaten Madame la Princesse, the Duc d\u0027Enghien, and their suite, when Lenet noticed her embarrassment, and gave her his hand to assist her in reaching a carriage. \n \n \"Ah! Monsieur Lenet, you are very fortunate,\" she said to him, replying to her own thought. \"You succeed always in enforcing your opinion, and your advice is always followed. To be sure,\" she added, \"it is always good, and the best results—\" \n \n \"It seems to me, madame,\" rejoined Lenet, \"that you have no reason to complain, as the only suggestion you have made has been adopted.\" \n \n \"How so?\" \n \n \"Wasn\u0027t it agreed that you should try to take ?le Saint-Georges?\" \n \n \"Yes, but when shall I be allowed to open my campaign?\" \n \n \"To-morrow, if you promise to fail.\" \n \n \"Never fear; I am only too likely to fulfil your wishes in that regard.\" \n \n \"So much the better.\" \n \n \"I do not fully understand you.\" \n \n \"We need to have ?le Saint-Georges make a stubborn resistance, in order to induce the Bordelais to call for our two dukes and their army, who, I am free to say, although my opinion on that point comes dangerously near coinciding with Madame de Tourville\u0027s, seem to me eminently necessary under present circumstances.\" \n \n \"Unquestionably,\" said Claire; \"but although I am not as learned in the art of war as Madame de Tourville, I had the impression that a place is not usually attacked until it has been summoned to surrender.\" \n \n \"What you say is perfectly true.\" \n \n \"Then you will send a flag of truce to ?le Saint-Georges?\" \n \n \"Most certainly!\" \n \n \"Very well! I ask leave to carry the flag of truce.\" \n \n Lenet\u0027s eyes dilated in surprise. \n \n \"You!\" he said; \"you! Why, have all our ladies become Amazons?\" \n \n \"Gratify my whim, dear Monsieur Lenet.\" \n \n \"To be sure. The worst that can happen to us would be your taking Saint-Georges.\" \n \n \"It\u0027s agreed, then?\" \n \n \"Yes.\" \n \n \"But promise me one thing.\" \n \n \"What is that?\" \n \n \"That no one shall know the name or sex or rank of the flag of truce, unless her mission is successful.\" \n \n \"Agreed,\" said Lenet, giving Madame de Cambes his hand. \n \n \"When shall I start?\" \n \n \"When you choose.\" \n \n \"To-morrow.\" \n \n \"To-morrow let it be.\" \n \n \"Good. See, Madame la Princesse and her son are just about going up on Monsieur le Président Lalasne\u0027s terrace. I leave my part in the triumph to Madame de Tourville. Pray excuse my absence to her Highness on the ground of indisposition. Bid the coachman drive me to the apartments assigned me. I will make my preparations, and reflect upon how I can best accomplish my mission, which naturally causes me some uneasiness, as it is the first of the kind I have ever undertaken, and everything in this world, they say, depends on one\u0027s beginning.\" \n \n \"Peste!\" said Lenet. \"I no longer wonder that Monsieur de La Rochefoucauld was upon the point of deserting Madame de Longueville for you; you are certainly her equal in many respects, and her superior in others.\" \n \n \"Possibly,\" said Claire. \"I do not put the compliment aside altogether; but if you have any influence over Monsieur de La Rochefoucauld, dear Monsieur Lenet, I beg you to exert it to strengthen his devotion to his first flame, for his love terrifies me.\" \n \n \"We will do our best,\" said Lenet, with a smile. \"This evening I will give you your instructions.\" \n \n \"You consent, then, to let me take Saint-Georges for you?\" \n \n \"I must, since you wish it.\" \n \n \"And what about the dukes and the army?\" \n \n \"I have in my pocket another means of bringing them hither.\" \n \n Having given the address of Madame de Cambes to the coachman, Lenet smilingly took leave of her and returned to the princess. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1647/48662.html","bookId":1205,"book":{"id":1205,"title":"The War of Women Volume 2","description":"简介： Two days later they came in sight of Bordeaux, and it became necessary to decide at once how they should enter the city.
