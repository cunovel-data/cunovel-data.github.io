{"id":19373,"no":16,"title":"THE VICOMTESSE DE CAMBES.XVI.","content":"On the day following the interview with her lover in the Carmelite church, Madame de Cambes waited upon the princess with the intention of performing the promise she had given Canolles. \\n\\n \\n\\n The whole city was in commotion; news had just come to hand of the king\u0027s arrival before Vayres, and of the admirable defence of Richon, who, with five hundred men, had twice repulsed the royal army of twelve thousand. Madame la Princesse was among the first to learn the news, and, in her transports of joy she cried, clapping her hands:— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh! had I a hundred captains like my gallant Richon!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Madame de Cambes swelled the chorus of admiration, doubly happy to be able to applaud openly the glorious conduct of a man she esteemed, and to find an opportunity ready made to put forward a request, of which the news of a defeat might have rendered doubtful the success, while on the other hand its success was well-nigh made certain by the news of a victory. \\n\\n \\n\\n But even in her joy the princess had so much upon her mind that Claire dared not risk her request. The question under consideration was the sending Richon a reinforcement of men, of which it was not hard to realize his pressing need, in view of the approaching junction of Monsieur d\u0027épernon\u0027s army with the king\u0027s. The method of despatching this reinforcement was being discussed in council. Claire, seeing that politics had precedence for the moment over affairs of the heart, assumed the dignified demeanor of a councillor of State, and for that day the name of Canolles was not mentioned. \\n\\n \\n\\n A very brief but very loving note advised the prisoner of this delay. It was less cruel to him than one might suppose, for the anticipation of that which we ardently desire is almost as pleasant as the reality. Canolles had too much of the true lover\u0027s delicacy in his heart not to take pleasure in what he called the antechamber of happiness. Claire asked him to wait patiently; he waited almost joyfully. \\n\\n \\n\\n The next day the reinforcement was organized, and at eleven in the morning it started up the river; but, as mud and current were both adverse, they did not expect to arrive until the day following, being obliged to rely entirely upon their oars. Captain Ravailly, who was in command of the expedition was instructed to reconnoitre at the same time the fort of Braune, which belonged to the queen, and was known to be without a governor. \\n\\n \\n\\n Madame la Princesse passed the morning superintending the preliminaries and the details of the embarkation. The afternoon was to be devoted to holding a grand council of war, the purpose being to devise means, if possible, to prevent the junction between Monsieur d\u0027épernon and the Maréchal de La Meilleraie, or at least to delay it until the reinforcement sent to Richon should have made its way into the fort. \\n\\n \\n\\n Claire had no choice then but to wait another twenty-four hours; about four o\u0027clock, however, she had an opportunity to wave her hand and nod to Canolles as he passed under her window, and those gestures were so eloquent of regret and affection that Canolles was almost happy that he was compelled to wait. \\n\\n \\n\\n During the evening, in order to make sure that the delay would be prolonged no farther, and to leave herself no other alternative than to confide to the princess a secret as to which she felt some embarrassment, Claire requested a private audience for the next day,—a request which was, of course, granted without demur. \\n\\n \\n\\n At the hour named, Claire waited upon the princess, who received her with her most charming smile. She was alone, as Claire had requested. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, little one,\" she said, \"what is the grave matter that leads you to ask me specially for a private audience, when you know that I am at my friends\u0027 service at all hours of the day?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Madame,\" the viscountess replied, \"amid the felicity which is your Highness\u0027s due, I beg you to cast your eyes upon your faithful servant, who also feels the need of a little happiness.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"With great pleasure, my dear Claire, and all the happiness God could send you would not equal that which I desire for you. Say on, pray; what favor do you desire? If it is in my power to grant, look upon it as granted before it is asked.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Widow as I am, and free,—too free, indeed, for my liberty is more burdensome to me than slavery would be,—I desire to exchange my loneliness for a happier lot.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That is to say that you wish to marry, eh, little one?\" queried Madame de Condé, with a smile. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think so,\" replied Claire, blushing. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Very well! That is our affair.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Claire made a deprecatory gesture. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Have no fear; we will be tender of your pride; you must have a duke and peer, viscountess. I will look up one for you among our faithful adherents.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Your Highness is too kind; I did not propose to give you that trouble.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That may be, but I propose to take it, for I am bound to repay in happiness what you have given me in devotion; you will wait till the end of the war, won\u0027t you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I will wait the shortest possible time, madame,\" replied the viscountess, with a smile. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You speak as if your choice were already made, as if you had in hand the husband you ask me to give you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Indeed, the fact is as your Highness suggests.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Upon my word! Who is the lucky mortal, pray? Speak, have no fear.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, madame,\" said Claire; \"I know not why, but I am trembling all over.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The princess smiled, took Claire\u0027s hand, and drew her to her side. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Child!\" said she, and added, with a look which redoubled Claire\u0027s embarrassment, \"Do I know him?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think that your Highness has seen him several times.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I need not ask if he is young?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Twenty-eight.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And nobly born?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He is of good family.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And brave?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"His reputation is established.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And rich?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, little one, yes, and we have not forgotten it. You are one of the wealthiest nobles in our dominion, and we are happy to remember, that in the present war, the louis d\u0027or of Monsieur de Cambes, and the crowns of your peasants have relieved our embarrassment more than once.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Your Highness honors me by recalling my devotion.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Very good. We will make him a colonel in our army if he is only a captain, and a brigadier-general if he is only a colonel; for he is faithful to us, I presume?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He was at Lens, madame,\" Claire replied with a craft in which she had lately become proficient by virtue of her diplomatic experiences. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Excellent! Now there is but one thing left for me to learn,\" said the princess. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What is that, madame?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The name of the very fortunate gentleman who already possesses the heart, and will soon possess the hand, of the loveliest warrior in my whole army.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Claire, driven into her last intrenchments, was summoning all her courage to pronounce the name of Canolles, when suddenly they heard a horse gallop into the court-yard, and in another moment the confused murmur of many voices, indicating the arrival of important news. \\n\\n \\n\\n The princess ran to the window. A courier, begrimed with dust and reeking with perspiration, had just leaped from his horse, and was surrounded by a number of persons, to whom he seemed to be giving the details of some occurrence; and as the words fell from his lips, his listeners were overwhelmed with grief and consternation. The princess could not contain her curiosity, but opened the window and called: \"Let him come up!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The messenger looked up, recognized the princess, and darted to the stairway. In a few moments he was ushered into her apartment, covered with mud as he was, with disordered hair, and a hoarse, parched voice. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Pray pardon me, your Highness,\" said he, \"for appearing before you in my present condition! But I am the bearer of news at the mere utterance of which doors give way; Vayres has capitulated!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The princess started back; Claire let her arms fall despairingly; Lenet, who entered behind the messenger, turned pale. \\n\\n \\n\\n Five or six other persons, who had so far forgotten the respect due the princess as to invade her chamber, were stricken dumb with dismay. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Monsieur Ravailly,\" said Lenet,—for the messenger was no other than our captain of Navailles,—\"repeat what you said, for I find it hard to credit.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I say again, monsieur: Vayres has capitulated!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Capitulated!\" echoed the princess; \"what of the reinforcements you led thither?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We arrived too late, madame! Richon was in the act of surrendering at the very moment of our arrival.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Richon surrendered!\" cried Madame la Princesse; \"the coward!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n This exclamation sent a shiver down the back of everybody who heard it; but all remained mute, save Lenet. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Madame,\" said he, sternly, heedless of wounding Madame de Condé\u0027s pride, \"do not forget that the honor of men is at the mercy of princes, as their lives are in the hands of God. Do not brand with the name of coward the bravest of your servants, unless you would see all the most faithful abandon you to-morrow, when they see how you treat their fellows, leaving you alone, accursed and lost.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Monsieur!\" exclaimed the princess. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Madame,\" rejoined Lenet, \"I say again to your Highness that Richon is not a coward,—that I will answer for him with my head; and if he capitulated, it was certainly because he could not do otherwise.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The princess, pale with rage, was about to hurl at Lenet one of the aristocratic invectives which she deemed a sufficient substitute for good sense; but when she saw the averted faces, and eyes that avoided her own, Lenet with head erect, and Ravailly looking down at the floor, she realized that her cause would indeed be lost if she persevered in that fatal system; so she resorted to her usual argument. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Unfortunate princess that I am,\" said she; \"every one abandons me, fortune as well as men! Ah! my child, my poor child, you will undergo the same fate as your father!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n This wail of womanly weakness, this burst of maternal grief, found, as always, an echo in the hearts of those who stood by. The comedy, which the princess had so often enacted with success, once more accomplished its purpose. \\n\\n \\n\\n Meanwhile Lenet made Ravailly repeat all that he could tell him concerning the capitulation of Vayres. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah! I knew it must be so!\" he suddenly ejaculated. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What did you know?\" the princess asked him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That Richon was no coward, madame.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What has confirmed you in that opinion?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The fact that he held out two days and two nights; that he would have been buried beneath the ruins of his fort had not a company of recruits rebelled and forced him to capitulate.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He should have died, monsieur, rather than surrender,\" said the princess. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah! madame, can one die when one chooses?\" said Lenet. \"I trust,\" he added, turning to Ravailly, \"that he obtained honorable terms.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No terms at all, I fear,\" Ravailly replied. \"I was told that the negotiations were conducted by a lieutenant, so that there may have been some treachery, and instead of having an opportunity to make terms Richon was betrayed.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, yes,\" cried Lenet, \"he must have been betrayed! I know Richon, and I know that he is incapable, I will not insult him by saying of a cowardly act, but of an act of weakness. Oh, madame!\" continued Lenet, \"betrayed, do you understand? Let us look to his safety at once. Surrender negotiated by a lieutenant, Monsieur Ravailly? There is some great misfortune hovering over poor Richon\u0027s head. Write quickly, madame; write, I entreat you!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Write?\" said the princess, sourly; \"why should I write, pray?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, to save him, madame.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nonsense! when a man surrenders a fortress, he takes measures to ensure his own safety.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But do you not understand that he didn\u0027t surrender it, madame? Do you not hear what the captain says, that he was betrayed, sold perhaps,—that it was a lieutenant who signed the capitulation, and not he?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What would you have me do for your Richon?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What would I have you do for him? Do you forget, madame, the subterfuge to which we resorted to put him in command at Vayres?—that we made use of a paper, signed in blank by Monsieur d\u0027épernon, and that he has resisted a royal army commanded by the queen and king in person?—that Richon is the first man to raise the standard of rebellion, and that they will surely make an example of him? Ah! madame, in Heaven\u0027s name, write to Monsieur de La Meilleraie; send a messenger, a flag of truce.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Upon what errand should the messenger, or flag of truce, be sent?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"To prevent at all hazards the death of a gallant officer; for if you do not make haste—Oh! I know the queen, madame, and perhaps the messenger will arrive too late as it is!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Too late?\" said the princess; \"pray, have we no hostages? Have we not some officers of the king as prisoners at Chantilly, at Montrond, and here?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Claire rose from her chair in terror. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, madame! madame!\" she cried, \"do what Monsieur Lenet says: reprisals will not restore Monsieur Richon\u0027s liberty.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s not a question of his liberty, but of his life,\" said Lenet, with gloomy persistence. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Very well,\" said the princess, \"what they do, we will do; prison for prison, scaffold for scaffold.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Claire cried out and fell upon her knees. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah! madame,\" said she, \"Monsieur Richon is one of my friends. I have just asked you to grant me a favor, and you promised to do so. I ask you to put forth all your influence to save Monsieur Richon.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Claire was kneeling. The princess seized the opportunity to grant at her entreaty what she declined to grant in obedience to the somewhat harsh advice of Lenet. She walked to a table, seized a pen, and wrote to Monsieur de La Meilleraie a request for the exchange of Richon for such one of the officers whom she held as prisoners as the queen might select. Having written the letter she looked about for a messenger. Thereupon, suffering as he still was from his wound, and worn out by his recent expedition, Ravailly offered his services, on the single condition that he should have a fresh horse. The princess authorized him to take whatever horse he chose from her stables, and the captain left the room, animated by the cries of the crowd, the exhortations of Lenet, and the entreaties of Claire. \\n\\n \\n\\n An instant after, they heard the murmuring of the people outside as Ravailly explained his errand to them; in their joy, they shouted at the top of their voices:— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Madame la Princesse! Monsieur le Duc d\u0027Enghien!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Worn out by these daily exhibitions of herself, which she had been making in obedience to what resembled commands much more than invitations, the princess for an instant thought of refusing to comply with the popular desire; but, as commonly happens under such circumstances, the crowd was obstinate, and the shouts soon became roars. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"So be it,\" said Madame la Princesse, taking her son by the hand; \"slaves that we are, let us obey!\" and, affecting her most gracious smile, she appeared upon the balcony and saluted the people, whose slave she was and queen at the same time. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1647/48677.html","bookId":1205,"book":{"id":1205,"title":"The War of Women Volume 2","description":"简介： Two days later they came in sight of Bordeaux, and it became necessary to decide at once how they should enter the city.
