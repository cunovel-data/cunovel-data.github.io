{"id":109767,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"CHAPTER ONE\n Burbank, California\n G abrielle watched Rider sleep beside her in the late afternoon sun, her hand gently stroking his bare chest. Filaments of light added flecks of gold and red to his blond hair and coated his damp skin in warm hues. Jack Rider was a good man... a human like she was, who hadn\u0027t judged her, hadn\u0027t lied to her, but who had become her friend and lover over time, even though he couldn\u0027t bring himself to commit to loving her fully.\n But he\u0027d also been honest about that. They both knew the reason why. Tara. Oddly, she owed Tara for sparing her, when it would have been so easy for that female vampire to take her blood to survive the Level-Seven Hell onslaught visited upon Master Yonnie, Tara\u0027s new mate. Yet Tara had shown honor, and had bled out only her demon brothels to heal him. Gabrielle let out a quiet sigh. The complexity of it all was profound.\n Life as she once knew it was peeling away from her; New Orleans was gone, the French Quarter and her establishments were now shambles and mud hovels. Hundreds of people had died, graves were overturned, and the spirits were restless.\n It was time. Her bargain with the dark side would be a debt called in soon. Gabrielle brushed a stray lock of mussed hair away from Rider\u0027s forehead and kissed him there softly so not to wake him. He looked so peaceful when his haunted eyes were closed and his breaths came deep and slow. But she also enjoyed his ribald humor; a slight smile tugged at her mouth. Yes, she loved Jack Rider.\n Ever so gently, she nestled her head in the crook of his shoulder and felt him stir to protectively pull her in beside him, and wondered what her life might have been like had she met him before she made a dark bargain. As she listened to him breathe and his heart quietly thud within his chest, she knew the answer. There would have been no coven brothels, no death, Hell, and destruction in her life. She would have stayed within the safety of this semi-jaded Guardian\u0027s arms and never let him go.\n Tears of remorse wet her lashes, but she refused to cry. The forces of darkness were realigning; she\u0027d felt it in her bones. The dark covens had surged up, briefly siphoning power from all, and then it went still in the underworld. An event had been set in motion. Something had happened, and now the aftermath would have to play itself out. It was a strange knowing, like something was gloating and watching an evil strategy take form, and it could now just confidently sit back and watch the pawns move on an unseen chessboard, but she couldn\u0027t put her finger on the source.\n For a moment she\u0027d thought this was the final hour, that she\u0027d been called to deliver what she\u0027d promised so long ago to the Dark Lord, but then an eerie stillness had claimed her. Temporary reprieve had been granted, a more powerful female had taken the brunt of the unseen fury. However, one day or night her turn would come due, and she wanted Jack Rider and the Guardians nowhere near that awful conclusion. She also had to protect her two young coven initiates... they, like her, had come into this life out of desperation, not knowing how long a dark eternity could be.\n Gabrielle leaned up and brushed Rider\u0027s lips with a soft kiss to wake him, watching his eyes slowly open. \"You should go home,\" she said quietly.\n He smiled and cupped her face with his palm and glimpsed the bright sunlight. \"Don\u0027t tell me I\u0027m losing my touch, darlin\u0027. You putting me out already?\"\n She forced a smile and allowed her finger to trail along the edge of Rider\u0027s jaw. \"Never,\" she whispered. \"I just have a funny feeling they\u0027re gonna need you there.\"\n For a moment he didn\u0027t move, his smile fading into a sober expression. \"Gabby, what\u0027s wrong?\"\n She sat up slowly in bed; he followed suit, staring at her. The hotel room felt like it was closing in on her.\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" she said quietly, \"I just want you safe. Even in the daytime.\" \"Now you\u0027re making me nervous.\"\n Too many thoughts crowded into her mind at once, and it took her a moment to sort them out before she could reply. Dark power was realigning, and he didn\u0027t need to be anywhere near a lightning rod--her. If the surge she\u0027d felt was accurate, then he also needed to go back to the new Guardian compound to help protect her sister and niece and nephew. The senior members of the team couldn\u0027t be distracted during this fragile space and time.\n Gabrielle gazed at Rider for a moment without speaking. Krissy, her young niece, had the potential, like her mother, Marjorie, to be a significant white lighter. Her sister, Marj, was going to need all the guidance possible to take over her role, once Hell demanded full payment. Bobby, her nephew, stood on the precipice between becoming either a wizard or warlock. Their decisions needed to be clear--go toward the Light. Bobby needed to lean wizard, Krissy and Marj toward Druid white-lighter Celtic ancestry that ran through their collective bloodlines. None of them needed to do what she\u0027d done.\n Gabrielle\u0027s eyes searched Rider\u0027s. Her family being with a Neteru Guardian team was the only thing that allowed her to sleep at night; her family had a choice that would be heavily weighted by the powerful influence of the Light. They didn\u0027t have to go out like she had, making the dark and irreversible decision of black magic.\n \"I love you, Jack Rider.\" It was the first of many thoughts that leapt to the front of her mind.\n He lowered his forehead to hers and stroked her hair, but didn\u0027t answer.\n \"No commitments, remember?\" she whispered, her fingers trembling as they grazed his jaw. \"I\u0027m a big girl, and I understand.\"\n \"It\u0027s not like that,\" he said quietly. \"It\u0027s just . . .\"\n \"I know I\u0027m not Tara.\"\n He let his breath out hard in a sad sigh. \"You don\u0027t have to wear lavender for me.\"\n \"I know,\" she murmured. \"You tell me that every time. But I do it because I know you need that, even if you\u0027d never expect it and would touch me without it. Just knowing the sacrifice you\u0027d make to lie with me without that scent, is enough.... You respect me by not requiring it. That\u0027s also enough.\"\n \"It\u0027s not a sacrifice to touch you, Gabrielle. You\u0027re a beautiful woman in your own right. Gorgeous auburn hair,\" he said quietly, allowing his fingers to become tangled in her long, silky tresses. \"Pretty face, smoky, green eyes, wonderful mouth... fantastic body that can stop traffic on Sunset Boulevard. Go shower and get the lavender off you and I\u0027ll call housekeeping to get the sheets changed, and then I\u0027ll show you it doesn\u0027t have anything to do with the lavender you wear. Afterward, you tell me if you still think it\u0027s a sacrifice for me to be with you.\" He shook his head in disbelief. \"Is that why you want me to leave? Because if I did that to you, made you feel like that, then I\u0027m sorry.\"\n His hazel eyes held such gentle sadness that she almost turned away from him.\n \"No,\" she said, and swallowed unshed tears. \"You didn\u0027t make me feel that... you never do. But you do have a way of making a woman feel cherished for a few hours in a way that I never knew was possible. I\u0027m getting too attached to you, because of that.\" She forced a smile. \"That\u0027s why you have to go.\"\n \"You\u0027re real easy to grow attached to, yourself, kiddo.\" He offered her a half-smile and took her mouth slowly.\n She shivered as his rough palm slid down her shoulder and cupped her breast, feeling a renewed heat begin to warm her. But she had to remember more important things. \"I\u0027m glad you only brought Bobby to the New Orleans house once. Don\u0027t bring him to the one in Los Angeles. Promise me. He\u0027s in training and doesn\u0027t need to indulge and get his head all screwed up. As it is, my initiate, Jasmine, hasn\u0027t been able to concentrate on anything but him since he deflowered her.\" Gabrielle forced a chuckle. \"You Guardians have a way of making a girl crazy, did you know that?\"\n Rider chuckled and sighed, allowing his hand to glide over the swell of her naked hip. \"I don\u0027t know if that was a good thing or a bad thing, giving Bobby a onetime taste of female affection. Now that he\u0027s no longer a virgin, the poor kid is really bouncing off the walls. But, Dan, God bless him, is gonna have an aneurysm if I don\u0027t bring him to see one of your girls again soon.\" So much was changing, just like his beloved New Orleans. He just prayed Gabrielle would be a constant for a little longer.\n She shook her head, her eyes holding a warning. \"Don\u0027t. He\u0027s young, doesn\u0027t need to be corrupted, and my establishments are too dangerous--and I can\u0027t afford to lose another initiate right now.\" She tried to soften her warning with a smile. \"If I let him have Heather, then where would this witch be? No virgin initiates to appease the beast. I don\u0027t want Dan or any of you guys fooling around with anything in my establishment that might bear fangs... or a human female that\u0027s got a negative aura, especially not your young guys. Not now.\"\n Rider looked at her and stopped the lazy caress up and down her hip. \"Okay... but he\u0027s also male, young, and a Guardian, and the Light doesn\u0027t exactly move at the speed of light. That kid could be left hanging for a very long time, Gabby. I won\u0027t let anything happen to him.\"\n \"I know,\" she said, gathering the sheet around herself and standing. Rider watched her cross the room.\n \"Okay, at the risk of divulging sensitive client information, er, uh, did one of my guys upset one of your ladies or something? Bobby being banned from your houses I can understand. Can\u0027t have your nephew thinking a certain way about his aunt--some things are just not done, and I\u0027m glad he still hasn\u0027t put it together that where I took him that one time was under your management. But Dan... jeez. For crying out loud, he\u0027ll be a basket case if several years go by before he gets laid again.\"\n Rider pushed back with his spine pressed to the headboard and a wry smile tugging on his face. \"Give the kid a break, Gabby. I had to get Dan out of the house when your niece turned eighteen a few weeks back. After the little fracas the brothers had in Arizona over her, Dan\u0027s frame of mind was damned near suicidal when J.L. gave her his little jade Buddha amulet and her dad finally let the two of them supposedly go have a private lunch after we cut the cake.\"\n \"But--\"\n \"You shoulda seen it,\" Rider said, grinning wide and cutting her off. \"The girl clutched the amulet to her chest like J.L. had given her a diamond ring, and then the two of \u0027em went all googly-eyed to the point where her own father gave up the battle. So, if Dan came into your L.A. joint on his own and momentarily lost his mind--\"\n \"No, no, no, it wasn\u0027t like that,\" she said, smiling despite the circumstances. \"He didn\u0027t offend, even though from what I hear, he definitely lost his mind for a few hours.\"\n Rider closed his eyes laughing and slapped his forehead. \"My nose is never wrong. Jose and Carlos told me the same thing--the three of us got bloodhound in us, hon. That kid was so torn up by your niece, he still has to do his own laundry. Don\u0027t banish him right now,\" Rider pleaded with a mischievous grin as he opened his eyes. \"He\u0027s a tactical, and suffering... your niece is flitting around the house wide-open, new sexual experience flushed on her pretty face, looking like the blond cheerleader of Dan\u0027s wet dreams and getting laid by a Kung Fu master, who just so happens to room down the hall from him. Gabrielle, you just don\u0027t know the house dynamics we have to cope with!\"\n She shook her head and fought a smile. \"But I just feel that it\u0027s too dangerous. He\u0027s still impressionable, like Bobby. I allowed him to visit once after New Orleans, and then I told him that was it.\" She threw up her hands when Rider laughed harder. \"The girls in L.A. are... oh, I don\u0027t know.\"\n \"\u0027Spectacular\u0027 comes to mind,\" he said with a droll wink. \"That\u0027s why I took the puppy out and let him get a good hard run on. At his age, realistically, he could go three times a day, seven days a week. It was only once after New Orleans. But you know what they say, Gabby, once is never enough.\"\n \"That\u0027s the last time, Rider,\" she warned, still smiling and folding her arms over her breasts. \"I\u0027m glad you left him at the house today. And I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re gonna do about Bobby.\"\n \"Don\u0027t tell me, you want him to find a nice wholesome girl and settle down?\" Rider slapped his forehead. \"Jesus, you sound like Marj.\" Gabrielle laughed. \"Yes, I do, Jack Rider. I want that for both Dan and Bobby.\"\n \"All right, all right, all right.\" Rider stood with a grunt and crossed the room to pin her against the dresser with his body. \"But for those of us already corrupted and no longer impressionable, please don\u0027t put us on newbie rations,\" he said, delivering a burning kiss to her neck. \"Been there. Did my time. We Guardian brothers don\u0027t get out much. Just tell me we\u0027re not banned and cut off from the most basic pleasures in life?\"\n \"Because I love you, after today, you are,\" she said, stroking his shoulders.\n He pulled back from Her to look at her. \"You\u0027re serious, aren\u0027t you?\"\n She nodded as sudden tears filled her eyes. \"I love you, Rider. I\u0027m not supposed to fall in love with a client, much less a Guardian.\"\n \"So, now I\u0027m just a client, huh?\" There was no anger in his tone as his thumbs caught the tears that spilled down her cheeks. \"I thought we were friends with a very definite understanding.\"\n \"No, you\u0027ve become more than that, that\u0027s the problem,\" she whispered. \"You were never a client, and are my friend. You just became something beyond that, is all.\"\n He nodded and kissed her softly. \"I know... same here. When did that happen?\"\n They both laughed sadly.\n \"That first time,\" she said in a far-off voice.\n \"Yep,\" he murmured against her forehead. \"It\u0027s always the first time that gets you, isn\u0027t it?\"\n \"Go home, Rider. Keep the family safe. Keep yourself safe by staying away from me until things settle down.\"\n \"The Chairman is dead, hon, last I checked. So is his replacement. Rivera took his head off with Damali\u0027s Isis. Lilith bought it on the side of a mountain in Tibet--saw it with my own eyes. Cold-seeking missiles got her and started an avalanche that I\u0027m lucky to be here to tell you about. Our two Neterus are in union bliss, probably off somewhere as we speak knocking boots. So, what\u0027s to settle down?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know... call it female intuition. Just go with me on it for now. Maybe it\u0027s nothing, but if it is, I\u0027d rest easier knowing you and especially the younger males on your team aren\u0027t anywhere near a place that has... different energy. All right?\" She stared up at his handsome face and set her mouth hard, resolute.\n He gathered her in his arms and released a long, soulful breath. \"And how am I supposed to rest easy knowing that someone very important to me is out there all by herself, dealing with the unknown? Like you said, we\u0027re friends.\"\n She held this man who\u0027d recently stopped drinking and smoking... this man who\u0027d begun to heal in her care. His tall, muscular frame made her feel safe against everything deadly in the world. The last thing she\u0027d do is put him at risk, yet she wondered how she\u0027d ever get him out of her system when the time came that she\u0027d have to.\n \"If it will make you feel any better,\" she finally said, trying to make him laugh, \"I\u0027ll be on rations, too.\"\n He smiled; she could feel his face move into the expression against the crown of her head.\n \"Oh, that makes me feel just peachy knowing you\u0027re somewhere as horny as me, but that I can\u0027t get to you to cure what ails ya. I\u0027ll develop a nervous tic knowing something like that.\"\n \"Call me. I do great, phone sex.\"\n They both laughed. \"Yeah, right, with seers in the house? Be serious. It\u0027s bad enough that the tacticals bristle and take a walk when the young bucks have to get the monkey off their backs solo. Now you wanna add me into their TMI schematic?\"\n She laughed harder and covered her mouth. \"Go home, Rider!\"\n \"I\u0027m being serious,\" he said, nipping her neck and making her shudder. He pushed her hand down his abdomen. \"Feel this wood, woman, and tell me you are not sending me home like that.\"\n She let her hand lazily stroke him, glad that he was smiling and that merriment had crept back into his eyes. \"All right. One more go \u0027round, and I\u0027ll send you home tired. But then you get your incorrigible self home before dark, and you stay there until my jitters pass. Is that fair?\"\n His eyes slid shut as he moved against her slow caress. \"Oh, yeah, dar-lin\u0027. That\u0027s more than fair. Just lemme return the favor in spades before I leave.\"\n \"Then definitely come back to bed, Jack Rider, so we can wear each other out.\"\n Beverly Hills, California Dan sat quietly on the edge of his bed in the newly retrofitted mansion, staring out the window. Seal\u0027s CD had been set on repeat, cut six, Kiss from a Rose, a mantra by now, something filled with hope to enter his tactical field and drown out the vibrations emanating from J.L.\u0027s room every time Krissy was there... now that she was in bloom.\n Yeah, it was true, just like Seal sang it--she could be compared to a kiss from a rose on a grave, and there was indeed so much a man could tell her, so much he could say. She remained his power, his pleasure, his pain. He was dying, the new mansion was his tomb, but he had to let all that go.\n Celtic and Gaelic chords took him so far back into his mind that for a while he was no longer in the room. Stonehenge appeared in the mist as the strands from the song entered his daydream.... He was a knight, his white charger rearing, refusing to enter the circle of standing stones. She was there wearing a crimson cloak, her hood spilling forward to hide her face.... Then she reached for him. A sense of desperation swept through him as he tried to dismount the frightened horse, and as always, she began to fade into the mist just as he\u0027d accomplished the task. All he could see was a wash of her blond hair transforming into a thicket of auburn ringlets and a flash of blue eyes becoming gray as she turned to leave him. Pain.\n A silent prayer constricted his chest. Don\u0027t go. I love you. No words escaped his mouth before she vanished. The loss made Dan slowly hug himself and begin to rock slightly in agony where he sat. It was always the same sensation when J.L. loved Krissy hard. Dan dragged in a shuddering breath and closed his eyes. \"Just get it over with soon,\" he whispered into the empty room. \"Just finish, for God\u0027s sake.\"\n He missed the old compound, the former team life when they were touring, the music was happening, and demon-hunting was a sideline venture. All the working out in the world didn\u0027t change what was, couldn\u0027t banish the dim reality from his mind as the sun began to set. He was alone.\n \"Not for long,\" a strange female voice whispered.\n Dan was on his feet in seconds, had crossed the room, grabbed his nine-millimeter and a vial of holy water off the dresser, and spun to meet the threat. The moment the phantom materialized, he dashed it with the anointed water and held his gun steady with both hands. But it didn\u0027t smolder, didn\u0027t combust. The faceless female form remained placid, the water glistening silver to make her aura brighter. \"Two seconds and you\u0027re history,\" he said, panting from the adrenaline roiling through him.\n \"I\u0027m already history and mean you no harm,\" she said in a gentle voice. \"Daniel, please put down the gun and don\u0027t alarm the house.\"\n \"Show yourself.\"\n \"Promise not to fire. I came out in the Light, during the day before sunset. I am not a demon.\"\n \"Show yourself,\" he repeated, his finger trembling over the trigger in readiness to squeeze off rounds.\n \"If you fire, the bullets will go through the wall and could hurt one of your brethren. Disarm and I will comply.\"\n He didn\u0027t lower the weapon, but extended his trigger finger as a compromise. Slowly a deep toffee hue filled in the glowing places where the entity\u0027s white robe revealed skin. Thick, long dark hair washed over her shoulders. Her face became recognizable, and he backed up farther, stunned, knocking over colognes and deodorant on his dresser. \"Raven . . .\" he whispered.\n She shook her head. \"Christine. Raven is dead, and I am who I had been before I was ever turned.\" \"Oh, shit! Marlene--\"\n \"It will hurt her to see me. Don\u0027t.\" A sad expression filled the entity\u0027s beautiful eyes. \"Please.\"\n Dan slowly lowered the weapon, but didn\u0027t abandon it. \"I cannot go to my mother without stirring up her old pain. I cannot go to Damali now, even though I owe her for the gift of release into the Light. She is in a very bad place within her mind.... And I cannot go to Carlos for a number of reasons. I do not know that he will ever forgive what I did to his brother and cousin or his human friends from his old life... or forget that I was his first sexual conquest when he first turned vampire. Too much pain.\" Her voice drifted around the room in a soft echo that seemed to be everywhere at once. \"Sense me, Daniel. You\u0027re a tactical Guardian. Do I feel like a threat?\"\n Dan now held the weapon at his side. What she\u0027d said was logical, and he felt no pending attack. Still, this was Raven. \"Why me? I\u0027m no seer. If you\u0027ve got a message from the other side, then one of the older seniors--\"\n She placed her finger to his lips to still his argument. \"I chased you when I was that which shall not be named. If I hadn\u0027t, who knows? Maybe then you might never have been inducted into the Guardian life. I owe you, and I\u0027m trying to earn my wings, trying to clean up the life disasters my poor choices created. So, I came to you.\"\n Dan could feel adrenaline-induced perspiration making his T-shirt cling to him. \"Yeah, well, I guess it was fate. I\u0027m here, woulda been brought in one way or another.\"\n Her tone was so sad and her gaze so gentle that a sudden calmness filled him. The gun dangled in his loose grip by his side.\n \"Dan, tell me, is the Guardian life so bad?\"\n He looked away from her out the window, unable to immediately respond. \"What\u0027s not to love? My parents think I\u0027m in Israel on a kibbutz,\" he said, laughing sadly. \"Rabbi Zeitloff handles the correspondence between us, and has people check on them to bring me word, sends them pictures.... It\u0027s all a bizarre ruse, but for their own good. They\u0027re happy, with parental bragging rights.\" He glanced away from the window and nervously ran his fingers through his hair. \"So, how about you? How\u0027s the Light treating you?\" Then he stopped and stared at her hard. \"Seriously, all jokes aside, what\u0027s it like where you are?\"\n \"Free,\" she whispered. \"There is no way to describe the peace.\"\n He nodded. \"That\u0027s very cool and real good to know--especially since on any given day or night, any of us on this team might find ourselves over there with you. Glad you got somewhere safe. I know Mar rests better knowing that you did.\"\n Dan\u0027s eyes held Christine\u0027s, compassion wafting through her body and covering his skin from where she drifted across the room. \"She\u0027s real good people, Rav--I mean, Christine. Is like a Mom to me, too. Really, she\u0027s like that for all of us, except maybe Shabazz.... You know what I\u0027m saying, since she sleeps with him, how can she be his mom? But, I\u0027m... oh, shit, I\u0027ve never talked to an angel before, so I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m supposed to say or not.\"\n Christine nodded and her expression remained serene. Then she smiled. \"I\u0027m not an angel, just a very lucky spirit that wound up on the first ring of Light. I have so much to learn, so many things to correct, and who knows how many incarnations to go through before I get it right. But thanks for the compliment.\"\n \"Oh, well... that\u0027s cool, too, I guess. Reincarnation is like a do-over,\" Dan said, slowly setting his gun on the dresser. \"Beats me why you\u0027d wanna come back down here to check on any of us, after you got a get-out-of-jail-free card, though.\"\n \"It\u0027s because I did get one of those,\" she murmured, her large, luminous brown eyes pouring empathy into his. \"I felt your pain, followed you here. Something happened and allowed me to come onto this side of the veil. Lopez almost followed me, but they\u0027ve pulled him so high up, I don\u0027t think he can slip out without them knowing. He has a message for Carlos and Jose, but it\u0027s not time yet to deliver it. Padre has work to do, some other mission, but sends his love. You have to let Carlos know there\u0027s no hard feelings, just love here.\"\n \"Whoa... you saw Lopez?\"\n She nodded and looked away. \"He\u0027s in our old line from that old existence.... They let you remember all so that you gain wisdom, but it doesn\u0027t hurt once you\u0027ve faced it and admitted it. I\u0027m in an atonement phase, I guess. That\u0027s why I\u0027m here to help.\"\n Dan shrugged and jammed his weapon-free hand into his sweatpants pocket. \"Well, we did pretty good on our own in Tibet, unless you guys from the unseen side of things were in the equation, which I don\u0027t doubt.\"\n \"We were.\"\n \"Thanks,\" he said, smiling. He carefully put the safety on his gun before sliding it further away on his dresser. \"Glad you\u0027re on our side... but we\u0027re cool now.\"\n She tilted her head and glanced away. \"I used to be a master vamp\u0027s lair mate... and, uhmmm... for a while, I bottomed out in the succubae realms. So can we speak freely?\"\n Sudden heat flushed Dan\u0027s face and he walked away from the smiling entity that glowed to brace his hands on the window frame.\n \"Tell me you guys don\u0027t see everything.\"\n \"We don\u0027t spy on personal things, no. That\u0027s unnecessary. We can feel things... sense the vibrations. Although we don\u0027t sashay into dreams uninvited, if that\u0027s what you\u0027re worried about. We only come when we\u0027re called, or if the person is really in trouble or upset and has a prayer for guidance in their hearts. You had one of those just now, so I came.\"\n He let out an audible breath; her tone still nagged him. There was too much amusement in it.\n \"You\u0027re not trapped down here, or anything?\"\n \"No,\" she said, giggling softly, \"and I\u0027ll go away, if I\u0027m upsetting you.\"\n \"It\u0027s not that I don\u0027t appreciate your looking out for me, but... just some things are really personal, and I\u0027m working through it on my own, and it\u0027ll really wig me out if you just blow through my room when I don\u0027t know you\u0027re there.\" He glanced over his shoulder and saw her swallow away a broad smile. That was the last thing he needed anybody to see, those times when it was so bad he had to relieve himself just to get through another day.\n \"I won\u0027t do that to you. I promise. I just followed your pain trail and heard the prayer and thought you might want to talk to someone who knows how you feel.\" Her voice had become gentle as she glided closer to him. She was truly beautiful and not the least bit threatening. But the things that had been on his mind weren\u0027t the sort of topic one discussed with a heavenly body.\n \"The truth is the Light, you know,\" she said with a wide grin. \"I can take some of that pain away. Just take the edge off.\"\n He backed up, rendered near speechless. \"How?\"\n She laughed, sending the sound of tinkling bells around the room. \"Not like that,\" she said, and then covered her mouth with her hand. \"Oh, Daniel, it\u0027s really bad, isn\u0027t it?\"\n \"I don\u0027t wanna discuss it, and I think you should leave before you get stuck here or something.\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry. I didn\u0027t mean to laugh.\"\n She came closer and touched his face. This time he didn\u0027t draw away from her. A quiet peace filled him, and the need to hug her to feel more of her calming sensation made him jam both his hands into his pockets. To his surprise, she opened her arms and embraced him. He\u0027d expected the touch to be ghostly cold and to pass right through him. Instead serene warmth radiated against his skin like a humid summer breeze.\n \"Don\u0027t covet what J.L. has.... They\u0027re making one especially for you--and right now, we need you to be one of the voices of reason. I don\u0027t know exactly what\u0027s going on, since I\u0027m new. But I know something is about to happen, and it\u0027s big. Just be careful, Dan, and don\u0027t worry about having a mate. One is on the way.\" Christine smiled. \"Would you like to see her?\"\n He gazed into Christine\u0027s beautiful brown eyes, seeing through her translucent irises into what seemed like infinity. He\u0027d heard the part about something major going down, but at the moment, his focus was on the last part of what she\u0027d said. Then he saw her, just like in his daydream. Gorgeous gray eyes and a lush spill of auburn curls. That was all he could make out in the mist blanketing standing stones.\n \"Wow... you mean you know that they\u0027re sending another female Guardian?\" His voice had come out on a choked murmur of anticipation.\n \"I heard them whispering that two more will be coming. The team needs that for balance. Daniel, I know you\u0027re lonely, and I know what that feels like. Just trust and know you\u0027ve been heard. Yours will be exactly the right fit for you. I overheard that she\u0027s really sweet and really pretty.... You\u0027ll know hereby her eyes... gray, I think?\"\n \"Is that what you came to tell me?\" he asked quietly, still gazing into the depths of Christine\u0027s limitless eyes. \"It\u0027s hard to believe that they\u0027d send a special envoy just to tell me, a new senior Guardian, anything so personal.\"\n \"They don\u0027t even know I\u0027m here,\" she whispered. \"I came, like I said, because I owe you, and I caught the prayer first. I\u0027ve heard murmurs,\n plans, but I don\u0027t know the details. But if it\u0027s coming from above, it\u0027s all good. I sorta slipped out while there was a bit of chaos, but have to go back soon. Everybody was all up in arms about something, and I figured now was as good a time as any to let you know I\u0027m available.\"\n He paused and didn\u0027t immediately respond. It was the emphasis that she\u0027d placed on the word available.\n \"You have to stay out of Gabrielle\u0027s establishments, though. There\u0027s dark energy passing through her houses, not that it\u0027s my business. Just a warning.\"\n Total embarrassment made him look away with a scowl. \"So, are you now like my Guardian angel? I thought you didn\u0027t spy on the living.\"\n She smiled shyly and glanced away. \"I just saw you go in, that\u0027s all. What happened inside, I can only imagine, but I didn\u0027t peek. But common sense is common sense, Dan.... If you need a friend until they send you a soul mate, then ...\" He let out a sigh of frustration. \"I can\u0027t have an angel for a friend, Christine. Not that type of friend, anyway. That much is common sense, too.\"\n \"I told you, I\u0027m not an angel,\" she argued in an upbeat tone. \"But I do care... and you\u0027re sorta cute.\" Christine\u0027s smiled widened. \"No, let me be honest. Actually, you\u0027re really cute. Handsome. That\u0027s why I chased you into the garage before.\"\n \"You were gonna bite me, then.\" His smile widened to match hers. It all seemed like so long ago, and strangely the memory didn\u0027t dredge up fear like it once did.\n \"I know. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I was gonna bite you--so sue me. But that wasn\u0027t all. Some of it you might have enjoyed.\" She blushed and glanced away again, glimpsing him from the corner of her eye with a sly smile. \"I said I was sorry.\"\n He chuckled, very flattered, and that made her giggle, sending the bell sensation through his limbs again.\n \"You\u0027re blushing,\" she whispered.\n \"Yeah, well, so are you.\"\n \"Oh.\" She tucked away her grin, but it kept escaping. \"Are you flirting with me?\"\n She giggled again. He loved the sound of her voice and how it sent tingles through him.\n \"I can visit in dreams if you call me by name,\" she said, avoiding his\n question and glancing over her shoulder nervously. \"I knew how to do that really well from... before. But you have to say it like a prayer now is the only real difference--really want me with all your heart to visit.\"\n He just stared at her. The proposition was outrageous. \"I don\u0027t think a heavenly entity is supposed to trip over the edge of my dreams,\" he said, feeling his face get warm as he laughed. \"Especially not the ones I\u0027ve had lately.\"\n She shrugged, but still couldn\u0027t seem to contain her smile. \"Can I tell you a secret?\" \"Yeah.\"\n \"Promise not to tell?\"\n \"Like anyone would believe me. If I told my brothers, they\u0027d say I was hallucinating. Maybe I am. But, yeah.\"\n She leaned in close to whisper in his ear, sending a warm, sensual breath into it. \"It\u0027s soooo boring. I\u0027m not complaining. Believe me, I\u0027m glad that the pain and horror are gone, but I liked being alive, when I could feel things.\"\n \"Whoa,\" he whispered. \"You shouldn\u0027t even think that, let alone whisper it. Words have power,\" he added, glancing around. \"You could get in trouble, couldn\u0027t you?\"\n She nodded quickly. \"I think so,\" she whispered, \"but I don\u0027t know. I\u0027m not sure what all the rules are yet, and I don\u0027t wanna get put out.\"\n \"Well, then, you definitely don\u0027t wanna step into my dreams,\" he whispered, leaning into her and making her giggle again. A light rose scent filled his nose, and he had to pull back to remember that he was talking to a ghost. \"You\u0027re really pretty, and anything could happen in my mind. Not to be disrespectful. But it\u0027s been a very long time since, you know.\"\n \"If you think about me instead of Krissy, it might make it easier to be around her and easier to not be so mad at J.L., that\u0027s all I\u0027m suggesting. I\u0027d be bringing, uhmmnm team harmony. That\u0027s good, right? We could just talk, if you feel uncomfortable about... thinking beyond that. It could really, really cheer you up.\"\n They stared at each other for a moment. \"How about if I call you when I need somebody to talk to? I really like talking to you, Christine. You make me laugh and are already beginning to make me feel like I\u0027ve got somebody of my own to hang out with.\"\n \"You do. I\u0027ll be your spirit friend. Besides, anything important that I hear from the other side, I\u0027ll bring it to you--and you can tell the others, if you need to,\" she whispered, cupping his cheek. \"If something bad is about to happen, Dan, I promise, I\u0027ll come to you first, like I did now, if I can. Okay?\"\n Impulse drove him, and he quickly kissed her cheek. \"Okay.\"\n She covered the place where his kiss landed with her palm, and then just as abruptly, kissed the bridge of his nose. \"Okay.\"\n \"Your aura is becoming lighter,\" she murmured sadly. \"You don\u0027t seem as down anymore. So I did what I was supposed to do, which was cheer you up, and since you\u0027re not in danger... I suppose I have to leave. If they find out I visited you, at least I can say I did a good thing, brought a little joy to your spirit and made it brighter again. You have such a wonderful light inside, Daniel.\"\n \"Wait. Hang on,\" he said, trying to hold her ethereal body in the loose hug they\u0027d been in, but she\u0027d begun to dissolve. \"If I\u0027m really down in the dumps or in peril, you\u0027re allowed to come--but if I\u0027m happy and safe, you have to stay away and not interfere with the living?\"\n She nodded and pouted, moving out of his embrace. \"Unless you reach out in a dream... and I so want to be on this Guardian squad with you. On the astral plane is where your spirit and mine can dance and play. There\u0027d be no distortion because you were in the flesh and I\u0027m not. It\u0027s different there.\"\n \"But what if something, you know, risque happens in the dream?\"\n Her bright smile caught the waning sun. \"What if it does? Wouldn\u0027t be my fault. You called me. Prayed for the physical agony to stop. Plus, I\u0027d just be cheering you up in your fantasy.\"\n He could see furniture that was across the room through her body now, and knew she was quickly leaving. Oddly, he didn\u0027t want her to go. Moreover, he was trying to adjust to the fact he\u0027d just been thoroughly turned on by a very sexy ghost. If she kept this up, he\u0027d sleep all day and all night, trying to hold on to her in his dreams.\n \"I don\u0027t know how To astral travel like a seer.... I\u0027m a tactical Guardian. Before you go, you\u0027ve gotta tell me how to call you, if I have to, uh, see ya again. It\u0027s been really bad, Christine, I\u0027m not gonna he.\"\n \"Just dream me, and I\u0027ll do the rest. Put on the music to raise your vibrations to the love level, say a prayer for the pain to stop, call my name, and I\u0027ll be there.\" Her gaze held his for a moment. \"The more information I get about the new Guardian who\u0027s coming, the more I can... sort of take on her shape for you when I visit, if you want.\"\n Dan slowly shook his head and stared at her, imprinting her into his soul. \"If you come to me like that, Christine, come as yourself. You\u0027re beautiful. Your spirit... your eyes, your face, your gorgeous, ethereal body, and your vibration is more than enough for me.\" His voice became a deep murmur of awed appreciation. \"And if you\u0027re my secret friend, then... I\u0027d wanna know you, not someone who\u0027s not here for me yet. I don\u0027t know her. I know you. I\u0027ll remember your energy tracer, always. Thank you for being there for me.\"\n Christine covered her mouth with her translucent hand and briefly closed her eyes as tears brimmed in them. She let her shimmering palm fall away as she backed up farther, dissolving as she glided. \"That\u0027s the kindest thing any man has ever said to me, dead or alive,\" she whispered. \"The next time you go to sleep, call me, Daniel. I will most assuredly cheer you up.\"\n \"Would you feel it, though?\" he asked, his tone urgent as she became harder to see. \"Would you feel whatever my mind came up with? And, would? I mean, like you and I just felt that kiss?\"\n She waved and disappeared, leaving him her soft giggle to feel with her whispered answer. \"Yes. Better. Just like it was real.\"\n Yonnie opened his eyes the moment the sun went down. Tara\u0027s body instantly covered his. \"Good evening,\" he said with a slow smile, somewhat confused by her passionate outburst. This was not the reserved Tara he knew, their new connection notwithstanding.\n Her response was a hard, punishing kiss, and then she pulled away, breathless, her eyes wild and glowing red. \"I have to feed.\"\n \"No problem,\" he said, growing concerned as he offered her his throat. \"Take what you need, baby.\"\n She scored his throat with such wanton pleasure that it made him arch. This was no mere feeding, and that Tara had initiated it was blowing his mind.\n \"Oh... shit. . .\" he groaned, presenting fangs. \"Had I known you were feeling like this all day, I would have stayed awake in lair and rocked your world.\"\n \"I need a body,\" she murmured hotly against his bleeding jugular. \"Human.\"\n \"Whoa, hold up, sis.\" Yonnie sat up and held her away from him by her upper arms. He stared into her eyes, reading thoughts, gaining impressions, even though her ardor had made him pant. \"I thought you said we weren\u0027t supposed to go there--no human deaths so we had a chance at Light conversion--\"\n Her fervent kiss stopped his words, and she pushed him against the jumble of red silk sheets then covered him in a hot swath of skin against skin.\n \"Yonnie, I need human blood,\" she whispered against his throat in a hiss. \"I\u0027m losing my mind... I need that now--can\u0027t you feel it? The power surge from below.\"\n Tara\u0027s caresses against him were aggressive and soon she\u0027d lit every pulse point he owned with fevered want. He could barely keep his eyes open as she mounted him and writhed against him. The moment he\u0027d entered her, he\u0027d felt it. Something stronger than he\u0027d ever known tore through him and made him flip her onto her back. His arms trembled as he stared down into her eyes, and then they both watched a black arc of energy crackle through his aura. Yonnie threw his head back and groaned.\n \"You want a body? I\u0027ll bring you fresh kill in a minute.\"\n Tara wrapped her legs tightly around his waist and reached up to hold his hair in her fist. \"Take me to V-Point and then feed me,\" she said between her teeth, digging the crown of her head into the profusion of pillows.\n The feel of her was exquisite, her passion genuine, and it was something that he\u0027d longed for and had been denied. The deep moan that traveled up from her insides created near madness. Only a flicker of sanity made him ask himself why as he moved against her in hard thrusts.\n \"If I take a body for you then there\u0027s no going back,\" he said between agonized breaths. \"Is that what you want?\"\n Her nails dug into his shoulders as she began to convulse with pleasure beneath him, nodding. Tears streamed down her cheeks, her eyes were shut tight. He dropped down to his elbows and held the sides of her skull, his fingers splayed in her hair, needing to know. Had it been any other vamp female, he would have gladly obliged, but after all they\u0027d been through and knowing Tara as he did, something had to be wrong.\n \"Baby, talk to me,\" he said, kissing her face, her mouth, and her throat in a fast spill. Her wails of ecstasy were slicing at his libido, and even he wasn\u0027t sure how he was able to hold on without fracturing into cellular bliss.\n \"You\u0027re a councilman---just do it!\" she shrieked.\n Yonnie stopped moving for a moment and stared down at her. \"What did you say?\" he whispered very carefully.\n Tara came out of the pleasure haze with him still lodged deep within her. \"I don\u0027t know . . .\" she sobbed, her voice catching in her throat. \"Why are you torturing me?\" He grabbed her jaw roughly between his fingers and turned her head to expose her throat. \"No humans, ever,\" he whispered, feeling a new level of control simmering inside him. Something had definitely gone down.\n \"But why?\" she moaned, arching her back to take more of him in.\n \"My Chairman\u0027s edict... unless I hear it directly from Rivera that he\u0027s changed his mind.\"\n \"He\u0027s no longer a vampire, Yonnie. He\u0027s no longer one of us.\" Her eyes were wild and desperate as they searched his for answers.\n \"He\u0027ll always be the one who elevated me--that\u0027s enough, no matter what he is now. My brother never lied to me... whatever\u0027s messin\u0027 with your mind I don\u0027t trust.\" He kissed her forehead, sensing a powerful darkness there that had been strong enough to compromise Tara\u0027s iron will. If it got to her, then whatever it was had to be serious.\n \"Then just do me,\" she said breathlessly, not sounding herself. \"Forget the human.\"\n Yonnie lowered his mouth to Tara\u0027s throat, siphoning a gasp from her as his fangs raked the fevered skin of her neck. \"I won\u0027t go against our brother, or fuck up a chance to get out of Hell. But, V-Point, baby... any night of the week.\"\n Lilith sat down very slowly on Dante\u0027s old battered throne, feeling it come alive at the armrests under her caress. As the red velvet fabric knitted itself together beneath her she closed her eyes, leaned her head back, and released a slow, burning breath of satisfaction. She would miss Dante sorely, no matter how insidious her treachery had been. He was special.\n But that was then and this was now. She watched without emotion as the Vampire Council Chamber on Level Six began to reorganize itself and the abandoned, pentagram-shaped table slowly gurgled to life with black blood now pulsing in the veins of the marble. So much waste, so much strain on the empire... she well understood her husband\u0027s rage. She would not incur his wrath again with failure.\n Concentrating on Carlos Rivera\u0027s essence, Lilith waited. The dark side of him that had been born from her machinations put tears of pride in her eyes---the entity had been so foul. Then the good one had killed it... just like the female Neteru had slain her Dante. The loss of her would-be heir, a dark Rivera, was profound, leaving a visceral hole in the evil empire--one of no less magnitude than Dante\u0027s demise.\n Lilith glanced up toward the cavernous ceiling, enraged that even vampires in the new male Neteru\u0027s old family still would not submit to the lure of human blood or the temptation of an elevation, and were still loyal to the Neteru team. Guardians hadn\u0027t even been fully compromised!\n Revenge gripped her and her nails grew to talons that penetrated the armrests. The Neterus would pay.\n Slowly, through the haze of sudden fury, she felt it. The sensation came into her spine like a lightning strike and made her throw her head back and screech with laughter.\n \"Oh, Carlos . . .\" she whispered, clucking her tongue. \"Now I know your dirty little secret--the one thing that will fell you and will make you lose your mind. I own your greatest fear... and now I can turn the blade in your side, thus hers, just like she gored my womb. Wait until Damali sees this.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-forsaken-vampire-huntress-legend-7/page-2.html","bookId":2531,"book":{"id":2531,"title":"The Forsaken (Vampire Huntress Legend #7)","description":"Storyline: \n The Forsaken (Vampire Huntress Legend #7) \n The Chairman of the Vampire Council is dead, and Lilith, the consort of the Unnamed One, and the Unnamed One himself are out for revenge against Damali Richards, the Vampire Huntress, and her lover, Carlos Rivera.
