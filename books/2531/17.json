He had to get away from the house. Space. Distance. Anywhere but here. The small colonial town of La Paz had his name on it. He\u0027d wade into the human pool of two hundred and sixty thousand people and disappear for a while. The City of Pearls.\\n\\n Carlos headed straight for his room to grab his gear. His mind was so besieged that he couldn\u0027t materialize anything but a normal, physical escape. That\u0027s when he heard it, the distinctive click of a Glock nine hammer going back. A woman\u0027s wails---Juanita!\\n\\n He skidded into the living room. Guardians had made a semicircle around her as she kept her shuddering body pressed against the fireplace mantle, a nine to her temple and her eyes closed. He stood helplessly watching as Jose\u0027s voice crooned to her in a steady, pleading tone.\\n\\n \" \u0027Nita, baby, listen,\" Jose said in a calm voice singed with hysteria. \"I don\u0027t care what happened. I didn\u0027t see anything. I\u0027m not blaming you. Let\u0027s talk about it. Just put the gun down, sweetheart. Do that for me, all right?\"\\n\\n Juanita released a piteous wail as her arm shook, sweat covering her body. Her eyes snapped open, tears streaming down her face. \"But I\u0027ll know, forever,\" she whispered. \"I can\u0027t live with that.\"\\n\\n \"Tell her something, man,\" Jose said through his teeth, his furious gaze briefly going to Carlos, and then becoming gentle when it went back to Juanita.\\n\\n Sunlight danced off the gleaming silver. Carlos\u0027s line of vision sought it, then found Juanita\u0027s eyes. \"I am so sorry, \u0027Nita. Please put the gun down.\"\\n\\n Suddenly Juanita yanked the gun away from her head and trained it dead aim on Carlos, holding the weapon with both hands, just like Rider had shown her. \"You bastard,\" she whispered. \"I, of all people, didn\u0027t deserve that.\"\\n\\n \"No, you didn\u0027t,\" Carlos said calmly. \"Of all the people in the world, you didn\u0027t deserve any of it.\"\\n\\n Her arms shook as she lowered the gun. But as Jose took a step forward, she instantly returned the nine to her temple. \"That\u0027s all I wanted to hear,\" she said quietly.\\n\\n \"Baby, listen,\" Jose said, slowly going to his knees. \"I love you. There isn\u0027t anything else in the world that\u0027s important.\" Huge tears rose in his eyes. \"Do you love me?\"\\n\\n She nodded as a fresh torrent raced down her face. \"That\u0027s why... I don\u0027t deserve you,\" she said thickly, her hand shaking as she fingered the trigger. \"You\u0027ve been through so much. I betrayed you. You\u0027re such a good man. The whole family... I--\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll kill me,\" Jose said quickly. \"Pull the trigger, and you\u0027ll kill me. I swear to you I\u0027ll die without you.\"\\n\\n The team held its breath as Juanita slowly pulled the gun back and lowered the weapon. Bitter sobs rang out through the house as she dissolved into a puddle of humanity on the floor. Jose went to her on his hands and knees, pried the weapon from her grip, put the safety on it, and slid it to Rider, and then gathered her into his arms to rock her as she wept.\\n\\n Transfixed, every muscle in Carlos\u0027s body had been temporarily paralyzed by what he\u0027d just witnessed. Profound agony; profound forgiveness. What had he done when he hadn\u0027t been in his right mind?\\n\\n His younger Guardian brother had just shown him life-saving magic. Jose had demonstrated selfless healing, a power stronger than any he\u0027d witnessed to date. Love that went beyond pride... a stronger contender had taken Jose\u0027s woman, yet he\u0027d still possessed a quiet dignity that didn\u0027t fear the public humiliation, could care less what others thought or said. It wasn\u0027t about them, it was about salvaging what he had, saving a soul, repairing a broken spirit, letting the past rest, forgiving the weaknesses of the flesh, putting balm on a tortured mind, mending a shattered heart, and bringing all of it back into the Light with love. That was strength.\\n\\n But the destroyed woman Jose rocked had also shown him something very deep in those sweat-tense moments. Emotional pain from being betrayed, the way that ripped through a woman\u0027s soul, shredded it, courier delivered it right to Hell\u0027s doorstep, then tipped it over the edge of the abyss and let it plummet with a mind, a beautiful body, and a gentle heart and spirit. Life, and all the generations of potential it contained, could have splattered against the stone fireplace wall just like that. From bullshit.\\n\\n The huge living room was too small. He couldn\u0027t breathe. All eyes slowly turned to him. He knew the attack was coming, the emotional lunge eminent.\\n\\n \"That was your brother, man,\" Shabazz said quietly. His expression had gone to a serene place beyond rage to contain total disbelief. \"Now I understand why Damali did what she did.\"\\n\\n Accusation glittered in all eyes. He was out. They didn\u0027t understand shit.\\n\\n \"How could you?\" Marjorie whispered, her eyes holding so much hurt that it scored his mind and opened it.\\n\\n \"How could I?\" Carlos shouted as the faces around him became blurry. Something fragile within him frayed and snapped. It happened so fast that it burned past his internal filter.\\n\\n Everything that had happened to him ripped to the forefront of his mind. The angels\u0027 commands. His accidental fall into the Chairman\u0027s throne... and oh, did he let them see the transformation in living color. A shriek pierced his ears. He didn\u0027t know if it was Krissy\u0027s or Inez\u0027s, but he didn\u0027t care. They wanted to know why he would have done anything to get out of Nod. They wanted to know why he\u0027d die, first, before ever being incarcerated in a foreign realm again? They wanted to know why he feared being weak and at the mercy of another more powerful entity?\\n\\n He gave them Hell on the silver platter of his mind. His mind spit out the horrid slurry it contained. The Chairman\u0027s torture wall, the burning sun. Every entity on every level that he\u0027d seen when he\u0027d tripped into the pit. Then he let them see his prayers on the Arizona plains in Damali\u0027s backyard. Let them feel the battle to get something so terrifying out of his system and the white-knuckle- producing fear of knowing that he was a virus, an agent of destruction, a carrier of demonic possession, a disease he feared more than cancer.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t care that their bodies had sunk to the floor. He didn\u0027t care that the team was breathing hard, panting through the fantastic images that not even their worst nightmares could have produced. He didn\u0027t care that Bobby vomited, or that Rider was clutching his chest. Fuck it, they wanted to know. Fuck it, they\u0027d already judged him. Fuck it, they could walk a mile in his shoes!\\n\\n \"That\u0027s what happened!\" Carlos shouted, his gaze a laser on each Guardian in the room. \"No, it wasn\u0027t her fault. Yes, it was wrong and fucked up. Am I sorry, oh... you have no idea.\"\\n\\n Glassy-eyed stares met him. But the only person who had not dropped to the floor was Marlene. She stood straight, not a tear in her eyes. Her arms were folded over her chest, and her voice was scary calm.\\n\\n \"Now that you have blown our minds and stolen our peace forever,\" she quietly said, \"we have a better understanding of what went down.\"\\n\\n Carlos nodded. \"Good. Then we\u0027re clear.\"\\n\\n Marlene nodded. \"Clarity works both ways, darlin\u0027. Let me show you something, all right?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Carlos said. \"I don\u0027t need to see--\"\\n\\n \"Oh, yes you do,\" Marlene said, her voice so slow, so deadly that he instantly raised a shield to his mind.\\n\\n \"Lock with me,\" she whispered. \"Just me and you, one-on-one.\"\\n\\n Carlos shook his head no. He\u0027d never been afraid of any human in his life, but as he looked at Marlene, something told him she was about to mentally kick his ass. As soon as the thought crossed his mind, she smiled a tight, angry smile of knowing.\\n\\n \"Drop that fucking mental shield,\" she said, sweeping toward him at a velocity he didn\u0027t know she owned.\\n\\n It freaked him out so badly that he actually raised the golden shield of Heru to keep her back, and to his complete horror, a purple arc deflected it. Marlene drew his energy into her palm and sent it crashing to the floor. Guardians started, but didn\u0027t get up off the floor. Everyone seemed rooted where they sat.\\n\\n \"I have had enough,\" Marlene said, never raising her voice. \"This family is on the brink of collapse. A house divided can never stand, and we must stand united against the unimaginable, or all will be lost. What would have been our purpose?\" She cocked her head to the side and folded her arms again. \"Generations are to be built on your Neteru shoulders. The family is the cornerstone of communities yet to come.\\n\\n Decimate that because of lusts and passions and rages and foolishness, and there is no family--no foundation, therefore, no future.\"\\n\\n She got up in his face, unafraid. There was something in her eyes so old, so wise, that the strength of ancestral knowledge wafted from her in molten energy bands to surround him.\\n\\n \"So, today, you are going to mind lock with me, or we\u0027ll fight all over this hacienda until I tackle your young, stupid ass to the floor, sit on your chest, and force-feed the knowledge to you!\" She walked away from him and stood across the room like a Western gunfighter. \"Open your mind. Don\u0027t make me go in there by force.\"\\n\\n The challenge bristled within Carlos. Fucking Harpies hadn\u0027t been able to go into his mind by force, and Marlene wasn\u0027t gonna stand there and threaten him, not today! Not after all the drama he\u0027d been through. \"You can try, but I\u0027d advise you to back off. You\u0027ve seen what\u0027s in there, and that was just a peek.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want what\u0027s in your brain,\" she replied coolly, \"I\u0027m gonna give you what\u0027s in mine.\"\\n\\n Carlos set his jaw hard and looked out the window toward the vacant beach. \"There ain\u0027t nothing you can tell me, Mar, that I don\u0027t already know.\"\\n\\n \"How did I break your shield, then?\" Now she had his attention.\\n\\n \"Because what I\u0027ve got can go through any substance in the universe.\" Carlos just stared at her. Now he really wasn\u0027t letting Marlene get all up in his head. Uh-uh. He folded his arms. \"I said, back off.\" \"I told your ass no, boy. Come here!\"\\n\\n \"What?\" he said, so indignant that he almost couldn\u0027t get the words out. \"I ain\u0027t no boy.\"\\n\\n Marlene shook her head. Shabazz stood up.\\n\\n \"Mar. Don\u0027t do it,\" Shabazz said. \"You\u0027re tired, baby, and he doesn\u0027t know how--\"\\n\\n \" \u0027Bazz,\" she said quickly. \"I got this. Don\u0027t step in between me and this kid. I\u0027ma spank his ass today, so help me. It\u0027s bigger than him and Damali. The rest of my family got put at risk. He has to get this lesson down, now, once and for all!\" Her voice escalated as she began pacing. \"I will not tolerate dissention in the house to this degree! I\u0027m not having it! I\u0027m not going to have my family splinter and fall apart while he learns!\\n\\n Enough, \u0027Bazz. Sit down.\" She spun on Carlos. \"I\u0027ma ask you one last time.\"\\n\\n Carlos had backed up to a far wall. The fact that Marlene was slightly scaring him made him worry. He didn\u0027t want to be in a position to have to fight her. If she got hurt, then they\u0027d really never forgive him. \"Mar, I\u0027m warning you--\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t make me snatch you across this room. I said, come here.\" Her eyes blazed with righteous indignation.\\n\\n The sight of her challenge with the threat embedded in it did something crazy to him. She\u0027d called him a boy in front of onlookers. What was left of his pride had already flattened on the beach. He just couldn\u0027t take it anymore. Not another indignity. He battle bulked, dropped fang, and glared at her, feeling the hot scorch of silver enter his irises. \"I said no. What part of that didn\u0027t you hear, Marlene?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s it!\" A violet current ejected from her outstretched hand and seized Carlos\u0027s chest. \"Nothing I feed, nothing I hold to my heart, nothing I care for and let into my home to be with my daughter will ever threaten me or this family! Ever!\"\\n\\n Jose was up with a gun in his hand, but to Carlos\u0027s surprise, Marlene slapped it away with an arc, yet could still hold him.\\n\\n \"This is between him and me,\" Marlene said coolly. \"Nary a Guardian move, hear! I\u0027m not afraid of him, never was.\"\\n\\n Carlos battled Marlene\u0027s hold, trying to send a silver arc through it to break it, but her hold was too strong. \"Lemme go, Mar!\" he shouted, twisting in her violet light and trying to get it off of him.\\n\\n But Marlene\u0027s eyes remained steady. \"You wanna blow me away? Do it. You wanna punch me or knock me down? Do it. Want to rip out my throat? You already tore out my heart, so do it. I can take it. Hit me with your best shot.\"\\n\\n Fury and frustration collided within him as he grappled with this old woman\u0027s superior mental hold. She\u0027d found the black box, hit the invisible seam of it with what felt like a crowbar and was lifting it.\\n\\n \"Get off me, Mar!\" he screamed. \"Get out of my head!\"\\n\\n Marlene didn\u0027t speak as his conscience began to slowly leak out of the black box in his mind. It oozed onto the floor of his psyche like sepia-hued blood. Suddenly he was on his knees sobbing, and she\u0027d pissed him off so badly that he hurled an energy ball at her, but to his surprise she caught it and cast it away. \"Put that down, boy,\" she said softly, \"and come to me without a fight.\"\\n\\n The tone of her voice lifted the lid off the box and everything came out, just poured it all on the floor until he was mentally standing in it waist deep.\\n\\n \"Stop, Mar,\" he begged, sobbing harder than he ever had in his life. He could feel her warm body come down to kneel beside him. A pair of aging arms surrounded him, even as he tried to shrug them away. Healing hands petted his back. A gentle rock made more liquid sludge pour out of the black box. He was drowning, couldn\u0027t breathe. Marlene breathed for him.\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t mean to hurt anybody,\" he said into a strong, bony shoulder.\\n\\n \"I know, baby,\" Marlene whispered. \"Get all the poison out. Give it to me, I know what to do with it, but I\u0027ma hafta show you what it feels like to carry it on the other side.\"\\n\\n Emotional pain so severe stabbed his conscience until he wailed.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s what she\u0027s feeling,\" Marlene whispered. \"Because that\u0027s how much she loves you.\" Marlene allowed everything that Damali had been through to pass from her heart into his.\\n\\n \"Oh, God, stop, Mar.\"\\n\\n Marlene just shook her head. \"You know how much that girl loves you, baby? You know how conflicted she is? You know what she felt each time you did some man-crazy drama and twisted her heart into knots? Feel it. Embrace it. Know it, up close and personal.\"\\n\\n His fist went to his chest. His heart stopped beating and seized, and then restarted. He turned and vomited, but Marlene didn\u0027t move or let him go as his body slumped.\\n\\n \"She carried your baby... feel her womb contract and ignite with life. Feel that joy and the fear--the cold sweat of it,\" Marlene whispered through her teeth. \"Now feel it clawed out of her, and her heart along with it.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, shit, oh shit... Marlene, for the love of God . . .\" His sobs had turned to hiccupping wails.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Marlene said calmly. \"For the love of God.\"\\n\\n He sobbed so hard and long that other Guardians stood and came to circle the twosome on the floor. He could feel fangs in his mouth, yet Marlene still held him.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s enough, Marlene,\" Shabazz said in a tender voice. \"Let the boy go before he has a nervous breakdown.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Marlene whispered. \"I\u0027m taking him to the rock.\"\\n\\n \"Mar, darlin\u0027, please listen to Shabazz,\" Rider said, going down on his knees beside her. \"Can\u0027t no man endure going to the rock like that. C\u0027mon, baby, I know you\u0027re angry . . .\"\\n\\n Marlene kept her eyes tightly shut. \"Rider, back off, before I take you there too, for Tara. There\u0027s not a man in this room that I can\u0027t take here, to you go find a place of peace and rest while I work--but do not interrupt me again. We clear?\"\\n\\n Rider stood quickly and paced away to the wall. Berkfield backed up, glanced at his wife, and lowered his gaze. Big Mike began to walk in a circle as Carlos\u0027s wails escalated to the point where it made him cry. Jose squeezed his eyes shut and clung to Juanita. Dan, J.L., and Bobby were leaning on furniture, the walls, anything that would hold them up while they sucked in hard breaths. But the women in the group remained steadfast, standing in a ring around Marlene as she worked.\\n\\n \"Bring it all up, Marlene,\" Inez whispered. \"I remember my girl... how she loved him when we was kids.\" \"Uhmmm, hmmm . . .\" Marlene muttered and then sent a whisper into Carlos\u0027s ear. \"When she held out hope that you would leave the streets.\"\\n\\n His head dropped back as a new wave of nausea claimed him.\\n\\n Juanita had left Jose\u0027s arms and moved forward on her hands and knees. \"When she had to leave you, and I took her place,\" she said quietly. \"She was devastated.\"\\n\\n \"For every woman you burned. Every heart you played with. Every hope you dashed. Every man you left feeling some type of way, because his woman was marked by you, feel it,\" Marlene whispered harshly against his temple. \"A woman\u0027s mind is not a playground, Carlos, whether you love her or not. Her body is not a jungle gym... her heart not a roller-coaster to take on spiking highs and plunging lows. Noooo... baby, you gonna get this straight today. You took Damali and Juanita on the tilt-a-wheel, honey. Let\u0027s go there now.\"\\n\\n A new wave of sobs invisibly split Carlos\u0027s chest wide open, carving at the soft tissue from the inside out. \"I know . . .\" he choked. \"I know.\"\\n\\n \"The look on her face,\" Marjorie whispered, her eyes distant as the vision entered her mind. \"When you came back from the ashes . . .\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t tell me, don\u0027t tell me,\" Carlos pleaded, but Krissy was now touching his shoulder.\\n\\n \"The way she would look at you every time you entered the room... oh, Carlos, she loves you so much. Why would you think otherwise?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know . . .\" he wailed, finding Marlene\u0027s shoulder to bury his face into it.\\n\\n \"Now do you understand what\u0027s at stake? What\u0027s at risk? What you were about to throw away?\"\\n\\n He fervently nodded against the older woman\u0027s shoulder, so completely exhausted all he could do was breathe.\\n\\n \"Do you understand,\" Marlene said, \"how your actions, no matter how justified you think they were, still hurt her... still sent her to a place no lover should go?\"\\n\\n Again, all he did was fervently nod.\\n\\n \"She could forgive your transgressions. But what continually ate at her until it broke her down was that you wouldn\u0027t take part ownership, wouldn\u0027t validate how she felt. You could only see your side of it, how you felt. But in all these changes you\u0027ve gone through, she was the injured party. She was the one holding the line while you learned and bumped your head against life. But you never acknowledged her sacrifice to regally hold the line on behalf of something greater than her--your relationship, and you never called her a queen--which is what she is! That was the crux of it. She instinctively knew that the whole was greater than the sum of the parts... old mathematics, ancient wisdom of synergy. Women invented it. It comes from beyond Kemet. We gave it to them.\"\\n\\n A sheen of sweat had formed on Marlene\u0027s brow, but she wouldn\u0027t relent or release Carlos from her tight grip as she spoke slowly, with purpose and definition in every word. \"It\u0027s not that she couldn\u0027t forgive what happened several times for various reasons, but your acknowledgment that she had a right to feel the way she did about it never came from a true place of contrition within your soul--and she felt that, too.\"\\n\\n Marlene\u0027s warm hands continued to pet his back, rubbing the purification salt of truth into the freshly opened wound, making him wince with every stroke across his sweat-drenched shirt. \" That is how another man got into your household, baby. It wasn\u0027t because of anything she hurled at you on the beach.\"\\n\\n When new sobs overtook him, Marlene\u0027s voice became gentler, but also more firm. \"If your fortification was strong... you could be blind, crippled, poverty stricken, disease ridden, and no knight in shining armor could have ever breached your barriers. He didn\u0027t seduce her. You abandoned her heart. He didn\u0027t pull her, you pushed her away. He didn\u0027t have more power, you relinquished yours. It is just that simple, honey.\"\\n\\n \"Marlene, I didn\u0027t know... I didn\u0027t understand,\" Carlos whispered harshly, unable to even lift his head. His body went limp against hers. His size normalized and his fangs retracted. All the energy within him felt like it had spilled out onto the terra-cotta stone floor.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s how a woman\u0027s mind works,\" Marlene murmured, now stroking his hair. \"And she would have had your babies, fangs and all. Would have raised her Isis against any encroachment of disrespect to your kingdom. And would have died fighting to protect your dignity, your ego, and your honor... but you didn\u0027t validate how she felt--you did that. Not Cain. He didn\u0027t pull her away because he was the better man. He\u0027s strong, yes, but no man can go up against a pure love like that and win. That\u0027s a wall of pure white Light. That\u0027s how I was able to cast aside your shield--with pure love... because I love you like a mother, Carlos. Ain\u0027t no shield for that. 1 want you two kids to work it out. Heal this family. Get yourselves together. Stop hurting each other and therefore hurting the rest of us. You muddied the waters, not just by your actions, but by what you didn\u0027t validate within her. That\u0027s where the first, critical brick fell away from the wall... the tower began to lean, and then you both kept chipping at it until it came down. Now you\u0027ve gotta rebuild from the rubble, brick by heavy brick.\" She sighed. \"It didn\u0027t have to be all of this.\" He could hear his mother\u0027s words, his grandmother\u0027s entreaties, could see every pair of hurt female eyes looking at him. His brothers\u0027 women, wishing their men weren\u0027t in the drug life. Mothers from the neighborhood standing over caskets so bereft that no more tears would fall. Mothers with young sons sending prayers up to God on their knees to spare theirs from the same fate. Women pacing the floors at night waiting on some errant male that was connected to his energy to return home. Damali\u0027s worried eyes, that time she\u0027d come to his club, decimated him. Moreover he could feel the vastness of their multiple feminine disappointment, their broken spirits, their unrequited hopes... the magnitude of it nearly sprawled him out on the floor.\\n\\n \"How do I make it right?\" Carlos whispered. There was no resistance, no game, no fraud, or false pride left within him. He\u0027d been taken to the rock so hard and body slammed against it that the Chairman\u0027s wall now seemed like it had been made of foam rubber.\\n\\n Marlene gently held him back and wiped his face with her hands. Love seeped from her palms as he stared down at the floor, too ashamed to meet her tender gaze.\\n\\n \"Baby, look at me,\" she murmured.\\n\\n He shook his head. \"I can\u0027t.\"\\n\\n She lifted his chin with an easy, slow placement of her palm beneath his chin until their gazes locked. \"You are a good man. Just young. This lesson you just learned in fifteen agonizing minutes, some men take thirty years to get. Some never learn it at all. You\u0027re blessed, even if you don\u0027t feel like it at the moment.\" Marlene sighed and smoothed his disheveled hair. \"This was a hard gift, but I had to give it to you.\" She smiled. \"You saved my life, so it was my debt to save yours. Like you always say, fair exchange is no robbery, Carlos.\"\\n\\n He smiled weakly and closed his eyes, too fatigued to reply.\\n\\n \"Do you understand that I did this from a place in my heart that is held especially for you?\" Her tender gaze made him open his weary eyes and stare at her. Marlene nodded. \"That\u0027s right. I\u0027ve claimed you as one of my own, baby. That\u0027s why I called you \u0027boy\u0027 Not because you aren\u0027t a man. But because you\u0027re mine. Hear?\"\\n\\n He nodded and looked down as new tears streamed down his face. \"I\u0027m sorry, Mom.\"\\n\\n \"I know you are,\" she whispered. \"That\u0027s why I\u0027m willing to go through all of this with you.\"\\n\\n \"How did you get so wise?\" he asked, his voice raw and thick. He wiped his nose with the back of his hand and stared at her.\\n\\n \"Because I\u0027ve had the privilege to lie under the wings of angels,\" she said, closing her eyes as the group simply looked at her. A serene expression came over Marlene\u0027s tired face, adding a surreal glow to it that was lit from an inner, unknown source. \"I crossed over, too,\" she murmured without opening her eyes. \"My body was burning. I was in so much pain that I couldn\u0027t even scream, then this magnificently caring being dropped over me and shielded me from predators. He sent healing white Light of pure love into the very marrow of my bones. The pain receded, even as someone slit my throat. He didn\u0027t know me from a can of paint, but he loved me, cared that I survived, and hoped if I died I\u0027d go out in the white light of blissful surrender.\"\\n\\n Tears rolled down Marlene\u0027s cheeks as she spoke. She stood with effort and clasped her arms about herself. \"He made me see the wrongs\\n\\n I\u0027ve done, too. Made me purge my secrets, rethink my actions, feel the effects they had on others. I had to face my own shit for the pain to stop.\" She glanced down at Carlos and offered him her hand to help him stand. \"I\u0027m not perfect. None of us in this room are. We don\u0027t judge you, because you\u0027re right, we\u0027ve never taken a walk in your shoes. But now that you know how we feel, that should temper your behavior from this point forward. This gift that was given to me, I pass it to you.\" She glanced at Shabazz. \"I owe you a serious apology. But we\u0027ll talk about that later, privately.\"\\n\\n Shabazz nodded and swallowed hard. \"You got all that over in Nod?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" she whispered.\\n\\n Carlos\u0027s gaze sought the window, hoping he\u0027d see Damali down at the beach. \"I just wish I could fix this, Marlene. I don\u0027t even know where to begin.\"\\n\\n She came to him and gently cradled his face with both palms. For some unknown reason, every time that she touched him, new tears fell. It was as though her hands contained a siphon, finding deeply hidden reservoirs of unspent emotion tucked away in wells he was unaware of until now.\\n\\n \"First, let me tell you... I know my daughter. She loves you.\"\\n\\n \"After all I\u0027ve done, she has a right not to, and I can\u0027t blame her.\"\\n\\n \"She has a right to, but her heart made a choice not to follow that advice.\" Marlene offered him a tender smile and kissed his third eye in the center of his forehead. \"Open that up. She still loves you.\" Marlene pressed her forefinger where her lips had swept. \"May I go in and tell you something?\"\\n\\n Carlos gave Marlene a half-smile. \"Do I have a choice?\"\\n\\n She chuckled and shook her head no.\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t think so,\" he said, yielding to her.\\n\\n Marlene hugged him and rested her head on his shoulder. You are her king. There will never be another one that can ever take your throne. Another man might sit in it, but you own it. She stands behind you, before you, beside you... as a queen, she moves, her role shifts, depending on the circumstances to guard the kingdom--which is what you two build together. If she ever stands before you, it is not because she doesn\u0027t respect you, it\u0027s because duty calls.You must understand that. Wlien she stands by your side, it is because she is your equal partner. When she stands behind you, it is not because she\u0027s to be your submissive mate; she is choosing to stand aside because it is your time to reign.You must learn to be what you are, a king. Your queen has been waiting for you to accept the responsibility with dignity... because she\u0027d tired and wants to stand down for a while... all you have to do is be ready to stand up--without taking her dignity in the process.\\n\\n But, Marlene, there\u0027s no denying he\u0027s better--\\n\\n Hush, boy, and listen to your mother, hear what this old woman\u0027s got to say. Carlos nodded and relaxed again.\\n\\n You\u0027ve been bitten by another, now she\u0027s been bitten by another. That was a breach of flesh. It is done. Inconsequential, given all you two have endured as one. But Cain never entered her royal chamber--not what\u0027s between her legs, I can\u0027t speak to that. That\u0027s simply her court. Yes, there were thieves in the castle. Regrettable, but not-- Marlene petted his back when he bristled. \"Shush,\" she whispered. \"Hear me out, baby, what I\u0027ma tell you is profound.\"\\n\\n She waited until Carlos settled against her again, even though his hug was tense. Her royal chamber where her deepest secrets are held, the blueprints to an empire, the keys to all that matters, is her heart. You are in there. He couldn\u0027t pry that open with a crowbar. She held her Isis high, stood before it, and fought him off valiantly. She didn\u0027t even allow him to nick her throat over the first bite you gave her... think, man, think.\\n\\n Carlos pulled back and looked at Marlene, his hug slowly easing to a gentle embrace as he quieted his spirit and laid his cheek against the crown of her head. Oh, Mar . . .\\n\\n Yeah, baby, now you listen to old Marlene. She reserved an ounce of hope that her king\u0027s cavalry would come. You\u0027re her kin. I keep trying to tell you. She\u0027s standing at the door, guarding her heart, exhausted, bone weary, nearly defeated, but would rather die than allow another to take your throne... and she\u0027s weeping down at the beach, spent. She knows she went too far with her words, I know my child, if I don\u0027t know nothing else... but her king, you, her lover, her friend accused her of treason, and she lost her mind, drew on you, because all she could think of was how loyal she\u0027d been. Go to her, after you contemplate all that I\u0027ve told you. Take back your throne, majestic child of mine... filled with potential, and start you a world. Never look back.\\n\\n Carlos nodded and slowly withdrew from Marlene\u0027s embrace.\\n\\n She patted his cheek and folded her arms. \"Now, was that so bad?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" he said quietly, his gaze slipping beyond the window. \"Thank you.\\n\\n \"I want you to do something for me,\" Marlene said, bringing Carlos\u0027s attention back to her.\\n\\n \"Yeah, Mar. Anything.\" His gaze searched hers. After this, Marlene Stone had his utmost respect and loyalty.\\n\\n \"I want you to use that exquisitely analytical mind of yours to work out a puzzle for me.\"\\n\\n Somewhat taken aback, for a moment he could only stare at her. The other Guardians did, too.\\n\\n \"All right,\" he said slowly, not sure where she was headed.\\n\\n \"Let me say this straight. I don\u0027t like him. Too smooth. Something\u0027s shaky.\"\\n\\n Nervous chuckles passed around the team, and a half-smile tugged at Carlos\u0027s face.\\n\\n \"Like I said, Mar. Anything.\"\\n\\n She walked to the window, leaned on the sill, and gave them all her back to watch as she spoke. \"Number one,\" she said, her voice no longer mellow. There was battle strategy in it. \"I want you to step past the pain and insecurity, Carlos, and dissect everything that older, smoother Neteru male showed you how to do.\"\\n\\n Her words stung, and he didn\u0027t immediately answer. She turned and looked at him hard, like a mother sending her child out to fight a bigger kid in the neighborhood to squash the bullying once and for all.\\n\\n \"You listen to me, Carlos Rivera. You have the best mind that I have ever sensed on the planet. That guy is older, so suck his brain dry. I want you to go back over everything you saw him do, and master it. You got that? Learn from your enemy. That is your charge. You saw him heal in a new way, use the Caduceus. You saw him materialize raw ether. Saw whatever, but learn it. Don\u0027t let him beat you because you don\u0027t feel like you measure up. You\u0027re a Neteru, too. Both have a little vamp in your DNA. He\u0027s a king, but dammit, you\u0027re one, too, and this is your yard!\" She walked a hot path between the window and him.\\n\\n As Marlene railed he could feel new vertebrae being added to his spine, making him taller, making his head lift higher. Sho\u0027, she was right.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right, man,\" Shabazz said, pointing at him. \"You learn quick. He developed his shit over several thousand years, but on this side of the rip, you got him. You just have to sidestep the rage.\"\\n\\n Big Mike pounded Shabazz\u0027s fist. \"That\u0027s a slick bastard. Shit, you one, too. Sooo... feel me?\"\\n\\n \"Right,\" Rider said, nodding and coming to Carlos to shake his hand. \"Listen, young buck, he ain\u0027t coming into this family without a fight.\"\\n\\n \"One team,\" J.L. said.\\n\\n \"One cause,\" Dan echoed.\\n\\n \"You family, he ain\u0027t,\" Jose said with a nod. \"Peace.\" \"Peace,\" Carlos murmured. \"And many apologies.\" \"I don\u0027t even know whatchu talking about, man,\" Jose said. Both Carlos and Jose nodded.\\n\\n \"I done tol\u0027 y\u0027all I ain\u0027t like him,\" Inez said, her hands on her hips. \"If I have to feed him, I\u0027ll poison his ass first. And, if he gets in my girl\u0027s face, I\u0027ll work on her mind and talk about him like a dawg until she screams, hear? Oh, I know how to break \u0027em up, if it goes there, puh-lease.\" Inez sucked her teeth and made everyone laugh.\\n\\n The release that went through the room was so torrid that one by one, people sat down to rest not only weary bodies, but spirits.\\n\\n \"Carlos, we\u0027re not supposed to be in it to this degree,\" Marjorie said, her soothing, motherly tone breaking through the mirth, but also adding to it. \"But we moms know how to mount a campaign to... sort of... derail things, if we must. You\u0027re our favorite... sooo . . .\"\\n\\n \"My mother can derail anything,\" Bobby said, laughing and giving her a hug.\\n\\n \"My aunt Gabby ain\u0027t no slouch, either,\" Krissy offered. \"If you need an extra ace up your sleeve... uh, we know some people who know some people, like Shabazz always says, right, Mom?\"\\n\\n Heather and Jasmine shared a glance.\\n\\n \"With me and Jasmine and Krissy on it, we could probably make him have all sorts of problems,\" Heather said with a shrug. \"Warts... lesions?\"\\n\\n Jasmine smiled. \"I could draw him very, very small.\" She winked and then covered her mouth to laugh behind her hand.\\n\\n \"Not allowed, ladies,\" Rider said, raising an eyebrow with a smirk. \"That\u0027s cold. I\u0027m gonna have to talk to Gabby, and you two are gonna have to do a round with the Covenant before we turn you loose on anybody. Sheesh!\"\\n\\n \"Okay, Rider, maybe not warts, but I could zap him,\" Krissy said, glancing at her mother. \"What? He\u0027d never know it was me.\"\\n\\n \"Well, maybe just a bee sting zap... aimed just so,\" Marjorie said, pointing low on her body.\\n\\n \"Aw, Lawd,\" Marlene said, chuckling. \"The Berkfield girls are ready to work juju for you, son, and put roots on Damali for ya, so you\u0027d better handle your bizness.\"\\n\\n \"I got this,\" Carlos said, chuckling. \"Aw\u0027ight, aw\u0027ight, nobody do nothing crazy. I\u0027ve done enough of that myself.\"\\n\\n Juanita\u0027s quiet move to the sofa made everyone go still. She looked up, her face red and puffy. But her eyes glittered with a level of strength that no one had ever seen. \"All this was supposed to happen,\" she said in soft, faraway voice. \"Sometimes you have to burn down a whole house to get to one rat.\" She looked at Carlos tenderly. \"You aren\u0027t that rat. Cain is.\"\\n\\n All eyes were on Juanita as she twisted her hands in her lap and kept her gaze lowered. \"It\u0027s not Yonnie that Lilith is gonna put on the Chairman\u0027s old throne... it\u0027s Cain.\" She peered up at Carlos. \"I felt it as I was ready to die. I had some of the other Carlos inside my head--that\u0027s who hurt me, not you.\"\\n\\n Marlene and Marjorie were at Juanita\u0027s side in an instant, each holding one of her hands. Jose was at her back, both hands on her shoulders, his forehead resting on the crown of her head with his eyes closed. Carlos went to her and knelt to be eye level with her.\\n\\n \"Oh, my God, Juanita,\" Carlos whispered. \"I\u0027m so--\"\\n\\n \"I saw it,\" Juanita said quietly. Her voice was so peaceful and so far away that it almost echoed. \"Padre Lopez held my hand. He said not to let Cain learn more about the advances and weapons on this side.\" She glanced at Carlos and then Jose. \"He\u0027s not supposed to learn this realm.\"\\n\\n The rest of the team gathered near her as she stared at Carlos. Suddenly her body convulsed, sending panic through the group as her eyes rolled back in her head, showing only the whites. Carlos was on his feet as the two seers held her tightly. Jose began to rock her against him in horror.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s burning up,\" Jose said, rushing around the couch to better hold her. \"Do something!\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t touch her,\" Marlene said. \"She\u0027s in a trance. I got her.\" Marlene moved around and waved to stand Carlos closer. \"Let her pull from you.\"\\n\\n \"I was the only one on this team who had ever slept with you before you went vamp,\" Juanita said in garbled voice. \"I was the one who knew your weak spots... your entire family, from mother, to grandmother, to brothers. They couldn\u0027t get to Damali, but they got to me to break this family down. I was the weak link, and when they thought I was about to commit suicide that darkness went down to the last place they\u0027d had you--my essence linked with yours on the throne of Dante. For a split second, I saw it. Cain doesn\u0027t even know he\u0027s being manipulated. Lilith must have a Neteru with Dante\u0027s line in him to appease her husband. Without that, she cannot appease the Beast. I\u0027m female, she\u0027s female, Damali is female; Lilith\u0027s fear of her husband is also resonating from that throne. She cannot fail.\"\\n\\n \"Mar, she\u0027s going over the edge,\" Jose said, terror gripping his every word as Juanita\u0027s voice became more gravelly. \"She\u0027s not an experienced seer, and she\u0027s going in too deep! Pull her out!\"\\n\\n \"Pull her out, Mar,\" Carlos warned. \"Fuck a Level Seven extraction--we\u0027ll figure out another way, but shut \u0027Nita down before something happens to her.\"\\n\\n Marlene just shook her head. \"Let her work, this is what we do. It\u0027s scary... talk, \u0027Nita. What does the Beast want?\"\\n\\n \"Lilith has worked on this family night and day... worked on Damali to get her to break the walls of Nod. To break you, Carlos. If Cain sits on Dante\u0027s throne, he\u0027ll be the only ruling-level vampire, other than you, that has ever tasted Damali\u0027s blood... in the woods at the old house, they worked on them both, drove you insane... will break Eve\u0027s heart... will fracture the Neteru Queen Council... will come for your old line... Yonnie, Tarajose... will release the forsaken. The Beast is waiting for this to occur. They think all have been positioned for the fall... but they didn\u0027t know how much I loved you all, my family, more than heartbreak. They didn\u0027t know the priest angel held my hand... or was in the line to know, to remember.\"\\n\\n Just as suddenly as the trance began, Juanita lurched forward, shaking, sweating, and threw up a black mass of tadpole-like creatures, then slumped against Marlene, panting. \"That\u0027s all I got,\" she said through heaving breaths. \"Did I do okay, Mar?\"\\n\\n \"Douse it, Mike!\" Marlene said quickly, scattering Guardians to bring whatever purifiers they had in their arsenals. \"Get my black bag--baby, it\u0027s gonna be all right, you did good, real good, for a first vision out.\"\\n\\n Guardians bombed the black slurry on the floor with every salt, holy water, anointing oil, and garlic concoction they could find. Marlene rummaged in her black bag as Shabazz held it open, and extracted crystallized frankincense to hurl at the dark puddle, her lips moving in a fervent murmur. Hands clasped, prayers filled the air, and they watched the abomination sizzle and burn away in a sulfur plume, then disappear. \"All this time . . .\" Carlos stood staring at the floor, remembering exactly where the dark fluid filled with black, maggoty parasites came from. He almost vomited himself as he turned away, disgusted. And that it had been deep within Juanita from the breach shamed him to no end.\\n\\n \"It wasn\u0027t you, bro,\" Shabazz said, shaking his head. \"Now all this shit makes sense... from the contagion on--from Philly really, they\u0027ve been jacking with us from Level Seven, sending bullshit our way day and night. Damn!\" He looked at Carlos and walked over to him to land a hand on his shoulder. \"You all broken up and emotional, me, Damali all out of sorts, Kamal flipping, this scene in here, think about it, my brother, even vamps tripping, Rider, no one was exempt in the house... everybody was all fucked around, man... it wasn\u0027t just you.\"\\n\\n \"Cain\u0027s gotta stay in Nod,\" Carlos said, his tone serious and even. \"Not just for personal reasons, the brother is being set up. His queen mother\u0027s spirit will die of heartbreak, if Lilith pulls this off... then Adam will turn over the Roundtable and wig. This is way bigger than some bastard in Damali\u0027s face.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, but like you say, Carlos--knowledge is power.\" Marlene\u0027s arms enfolded Juanita as she smoothed her hair back. Marlene looked up at Jose and then Carlos. \"Didn\u0027t I tell you, love conquers all? They were banking on jealousy, team dissent, but our girl Juanita here came through like a champ--forgiving Carlos, loving him and this family hard, and loving Jose harder... enough to wanna live. Plus, they never banked on a young cleric they\u0027d killed, one still connected as a brother to this team, still bound by love to three souls: Juanita, Carlos, and Jose. Have mercy! Bless this chile; her spirit followed the thin white line up and out of the darkness holding information in her.\"\\n\\n Marlene closed her eyes, crooning to Juanita to calm her. \"Bet the bastards never counted on that, though, and now we\u0027ve got their asses.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-forsaken-vampire-huntress-legend-7/page-17.html","bookId":2531,"book":{"id":2531,"title":"The Forsaken (Vampire Huntress Legend #7)","description":"Storyline: The Forsaken (Vampire Huntress Legend #7) \\n The Chairman of the Vampire Council is dead, and Lilith, the consort of the Unnamed One, and the Unnamed One himself are out for revenge against Damali Richards, the Vampire Huntress, and her lover, Carlos Rivera.
