A ruthless and carefully planned strategy---one that not even Damali will anticipate---has been developed. There is only one entity who can best Damali, send Carlos packing, and put the Guardian team at mortal risk. This powerful being was once banished into a forsaken land and possesses everything that would bring a Neteru to his or her knees. This time the fight is not so clear-cut, and it is not only Damali\u0027s soul in the balance but her body and heart as well.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-forsaken-vampire-huntress-legend-7.jpg","author":"L.A.
