You da man, you cool. You told him he could nick her to get his energy right so he could jet.\" \"He fucking bit her,\" Carlos said, shaking his head, eyes wild, walking back and forth on the porch. Then he stood still and looked at Yonnie, incredulous. \"He bit her. In the throat. And she let him.\" Carlos\u0027s voice was a whisper of numb disbelief.\\n\\n \"Well, yeah, man. That\u0027s generally how it\u0027s done, right?\" Yonnie raked his hair but kept his stance readied for Carlos to bolt.\\n\\n \"In the wrist... yeah, maybe,\" Carlos said, his stunned gaze set on the horizon.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s a king, man. He ain\u0027t going for the wrist,\" Yonnie said, trying in vain to make what he was saying sound logical. \"It\u0027s cool. That don\u0027t mean nothing.\"\\n\\n Carlos brought his gaze down slowly from the moon and held Yonnie\u0027s. \"I\u0027m done.\"\\n\\n Yonnie began pacing. \"You ain\u0027t done, man. Be serious.\"\\n\\n Carlos shook his head slowly, turned, and headed for the screen door, leaving Yonnie to stare behind him. Damali\u0027s desire-filled whisper carved sections of his heart into slivers. \"No, man,\" he said quietly, I\u0027m done.\"\\n\\n The way she\u0027d breathed, \"Oh... my... God . . .\" followed him into the house and repeatedly planted her Isis squarely in the middle of his chest.\\n\\n She walked up the front steps in a daze, dragging the golden staff behind her. When she opened the door, the team looked up. No one said a word for a moment.\\n\\n \"You okay, kiddo?\" Rider finally asked. \"We, uh, got some newbies-- incoming while you were sending Cain back, and uh... you okay, D?\"\\n\\n Damali just nodded, and then glanced around the room to find Carlos. His vibration was coming from the kitchen, but she didn\u0027t move toward it.\\n\\n \"The energy transfer work?\" Shabazz asked carefully, visually and tactically scanning her.\\n\\n Damali shook her head. \"Where\u0027s the rest of the team?\" Damali asked in a monotone voice.\\n\\n \"Krissy, Juanita, and Marj went into one of the bedrooms to stay with Marlene while she gets some rest.\" J.L. glanced around. \"Bobby and Dan are on point in the back rooms in deep discussions... well, uh, that\u0027s the thing--Gabby sent us two new females, Heather and Jasmine and--\"\\n\\n Too spent to even cope, Damali just help up her hand. \"Where\u0027s Yonnie and Tara? We all have to move out.\"\\n\\n \"Yonnie\u0027s got the windows from the roof, just to be sure nothing bothers Marlene while she tries to rest and while Mike is working out the weapons list in the shed with Berkfield, trying to gather up whatever they can salvage from before,\" J.L. said, sheepishly glancing toward the door then over to Shabazz.\\n\\n \"Good,\" Damali said, too weary to say more. Fine by her. No more drama.\\n\\n \"I gotta say this,\" Berkfield said, coming into the house from the back. His gaze held Damali and then the others in the room. \"She don\u0027t look so okay. Where\u0027s Cain?\"\\n\\n \"Outside meditating,\" Damali finally murmured without elaborating. It was a struggle to use her voice for more than one-word statements.\\n\\n \"Okaaaay,\" Rider said, worry adding tension lines to his brow. \"So, if the exchange didn\u0027t work, and he can\u0027t propel himself back through the rip, where does that leave us?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, D,\" Jose said, adding to the bombardment of questions. \"Is he coming with us or what? I don\u0027t think we can just leave him here, but him going with us is a little shaky as a plan.\" He stared at her hard. \"You okay, D? For real.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t like him,\" Inez said, serving much attitude with her comment. \"I for one think you need to leave his ass here, but who am I?\" She sucked her teeth and rolled her eyes. \"I\u0027m just your girl. What do I know?\"\\n\\n Big Mike nodded, coming into the living room and dropping and ax with an armload of wooden stakes on the coffee table. \"I don\u0027t like how you looking, D.\"\\n\\n \"You do seem a bit pale, honey,\" Marjorie said, entering the fray from the hall and trying to keep the peace, but clearly concerned.\\n\\n \"You sure you ain\u0027t nicked, kid?\" Berkfield said, beginning to stand to go inspect Damali.\\n\\n \"She tried to do the energy transfer on limited reserves,\" Tara said quietly, parting her form from a shadow in the room and going to Damali\u0027s side to stop Berkfield\u0027s advance. \"But after all that she\u0027d already expended to bring her mother-seer back, she\u0027s simply tapped out. You are simply witnessing severe disappointment and nothing more. Her defenses are lowered, and she\u0027s completely exhausted. Just tapped out.\"\\n\\n Tara\u0027s hand landed on Damali\u0027s shoulder as both women\u0027s eyes met. \"Don\u0027t forget, she also traveled far to acquire the Caduceus, then entered Cain\u0027s world in search of Carlos, and then battled hard to survive over in Cain\u0027s land and return home. She may be a Neteru, but she is also only human.\"\\n\\n Damali\u0027s gaze transferred a silent thanks, which Tara\u0027s accepted. She noted that Tara had also spoken loudly enough to be heard in the kitchen. A double thank you was definitely in her eyes. Tara had her back.\\n\\n \"All right, then cool,\" Rider finally said, pushing himself away from the wall. \"Ten minutes, we saddle up?\" Damali nodded, calmly left the group, and walked toward an empty bedroom with Tara quietly gliding behind her. No words were necessary. Both women knew that a private moment to confer was in order. A woman-to-woman soul purge was required before the whole team was swept via vamp transport to La Paz.\\n\\n \"Can you please sound seal the room,\" Damali asked, looking at Tara and willing tears not to fall.\\n\\n Tara nodded and complied.\\n\\n \"What is happening to me?\" Damali whispered.\\n\\n Tara gazed at her intensely, slowly touched her throat, and quickly drew her hand away as though burned. \"I have been here. This is deep, white hot, raw, and very new. There is no cure.\"\\n\\n \"There has to be. I\u0027m not making sense.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, you are,\" Tara said quietly \"That\u0027s what\u0027s frightening you.\" \"I think Carlos heard me,\" Damali said, not ready to address Tara\u0027s evenly delivered wisdom.\\n\\n Tara calmly nodded. Damali closed her eyes. \"And?\" Tara said with a bite to her tone.\\n\\n \"And? What do you mean, and?\" Damali\u0027s gaze shot toward the door, fighting against the bubbling hysteria within her. \"One of \u0027em is sitting out in the woods horny and pouting, the other one is in the kitchen fuming and ready to flip, and--\"\\n\\n \"Let. Them. Twist.\" Tara folded her arms, her words succinct and sharp enough to draw blood. \"Do not be held hostage in the male power-play game. Right now, what\u0027s between your legs is for ransom, along with your mind. Your heart will be collateral damage in the fallout. Pull yourself together. That\u0027s what\u0027s draining your energy. You\u0027re stronger than both of them and don\u0027t even know it. I saw it with my own eyes when you healed Marlene. That\u0027s why I\u0027m shaking my head.\"\\n\\n Tara\u0027s forthright assessment splashed her face with much-appreciated cold water. Damali couldn\u0027t immediately reply. The charge stung, but also strengthened her, and snapped her right out of Cain\u0027s daze.\\n\\n \"So what that Carlos heard you? Haven\u0027t you heard or seen things that have nearly stopped your heart?\"\\n\\n Damali folded her arms over her chest. \"No lie.\"\\n\\n Tara tilted her head. \"I am going to tell you something I swore I would never disclose... because he\u0027s your brother.\"\\n\\n Damali braced herself. As the words had come out of Tara\u0027s mouth, the part about telling her something she\u0027d vowed not to ever disclose had caused a mild heart seize--not being sure if Tara was about to launch into another Carlos misadventure or something else. She was selfishly glad that it was something else, this time.\\n\\n \"I am old, you are not,\" Tara said flatly. \"I\u0027ve wasted years in this predicament. My hope is that you don\u0027t.\" Her pretty brown eyes held a strange combination of deeply wounded rage, yet mellow understanding. \"Rider was my first. I loved him with my all. Parts of me still do. Each time he was with another woman, each occurrence had plausible excuses... reasons... layers of circumstances that were always supposedly beyond his control.\" She let her breath out hard. \"The man has done the world for me. There has never been a doubt that he loves me. or that I love him. That is not the issue.\"\\n\\n Tara paced across the room and held on to the dresser as though it might offer her immoveable support. \"But he and I were connected, just like you and Carlos are. Like you, I have heightened sensory perception. My ears are tuned to the night. My nose is able to pick up the nuance of any tracer. My eyes can see far beyond the normal human range. So the blond hairs ground into, and woven within the fabric at his shoulder, I saw. The residue of perfume and other things I shudder to mention, I smelled--even after he showered... the heart-shattering sound of his... voice.\" Tara turned away. \"Or hers echoing behind it in the distance, I heard.\" \"Oh, Tara,\" Damali whispered, not sure if she should go to her, or bolt out of the room to kick Rider\u0027s ass. She stared at the vacant mirror that Tara stood before, watching the eerie confluence of the woman\u0027s body in front of her without a reflection.\\n\\n \"These are the things that carve out a woman\u0027s heart, rob her of respect,\" Tara said, pointing at Damali without turning. \"There is no excuse, after the first incidence. Not from Rider, or your young, hot, impulsive lover, or this new but seasoned king who speaks to you in sensual decibels and never uses foul language. Hold the line and refuse to be swayed by their antics.\"\\n\\n After the few moments she seemed to need to collect herself, Tara turned and spoke through her teeth. \"The commitment is what gets violated, as well as your heart in the process.\" She stared at Damali hard. \"You don\u0027t owe either of the men competing for your commitment anything, until they are ready to give to you what you have given... total .. . complete... unwavering resolve. Carlos never had to compete for your affection--let him work for it, after all the heartbreak that man has made you endure.\"\\n\\n Damali rubbed her chin and glanced at the door. This information coming from a female vampire was a bizarre contrast, but sound. Truth was truth, whatever the source. But she was still unsure, not wanting to get caught up in Tara\u0027s reality, which had a slightly different set of circumstances than hers.\\n\\n \"Then what do you suggest?\" Damali finally asked, fatigued from thinking about all of the variables too hard. \"Since it seems Cain will be with us for a few and Carlos ain\u0027t going nowhere until he does, what can I do to keep the peace and get a little breathing room just to get my head together and figure out what I want?\"\\n\\n \"Do what a man would do,\" Tara spat. \"In every other aspect of your life, you are clear, but in this?\" She began to pace as though holy water had been sprayed in the room. \"Outside, during the healing, you heard the she-dragon\u0027s voice, correct?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, I did,\" Damali admitted, renewed fury beginning to crest, \"but I had to let that ride, had to focus, Marlene was more important.\"\\n\\n \"Exactly.\" Tara stopped moving about the room and stared at her, red beginning to flicker in her eyes. \"A man would say, \u0027I haven\u0027t made up my mind,\u0027 and would keep both aggressively competing females at bay, doing whatever he chose with either of them until he was sure-- because he hadn\u0027t fully committed. Men are also quick to tell a woman, \u0027But you knew that going in, baby,\u0027 like that matters, like that makes it all okay, like that stops your heart from being broken--even when you know, how do you keep your emotions from closing the distance the male created? If you sleep with them and your heart is involved, you\u0027re wide open.\" Damali nodded, suddenly feeling too vulnerable to respond.\\n\\n \"If a man were in your shoes, my Neteru girlfriend,\" Tara added with a sad smile, \"he\u0027d eventually pick one or the other when he finally decided, or maybe find an entirely different woman without history altogether--but he damned sure wouldn\u0027t allow himself to be backed into a corner by childish games, or allow his focus on his primary mission, his job, whatever, to be fractured by tail. Ask me how I\u0027ve learned this?\" She folded her arms. \"What do they always say?\"\\n\\n \" \u0027Later,\u0027 \" Damali snapped. \" \u0027Baby I\u0027ve gotta focus on what I\u0027m trying to do.\u0027\"\\n\\n \"Exactly. And it has to be later, or you, as a female, can step. And they do not freak out if that\u0027s ultimately what you do--why?\" Tara asked with a tight smile. \"Because\" in their minds, the universe is bountiful.\" \"Girl. . .\"\\n\\n \"They cry in their beer for a few, and then become philosophical, recover, and move on.\" Tara shook her head and gazed at the door. \"Right now, they are holding you hostage. In the middle you stand with an entire team\u0027s safety on your shoulders, weighed down, literally, by the fate of the world, and they are pulling you in opposite directions, trying to run the ultimate seduction.\"\\n\\n \"You know whaaaat . . .\" Damali sucked her teeth and let her hands fall to her hips.\\n\\n Tara snapped her fingers and pointed hard at the closed bedroom door. \"Tell that arrogant king of old to take a cold shower! Tell that foolish young prince in the kitchen to back off, keep his dick in his pants, and get out of your face until he can respect your job. And if either one of them moves on you and arouses you too much by his sensual floor display of seduction, do him.\"\\n\\n \"Kill him?\" Damali rubbed her palms down her face. \"A little drastic, Tara, but I feel you.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Tara chuckled. \"Do him.\"\\n\\n \"Ooohhh . . .\" Damali said, laughing and feeling a lot better. \"But, girl, uh... what do I tell the other one?\"\\n\\n \"What did they tell you? Do them both, if you\u0027re concerned about equity and fairness.\"\\n\\n Both women stared at each other and then laughed softly, but very hard.\\n\\n \"Are you married to either of them?\" Tara asked with a sly smile. \"Nope,\" Damali replied, with a mischievous grin. \"Are you engaged to either of them?\" Tara prodded. \"Nope,\" Damali said, her smile broadening. \"Well... maybe, kinda sorta to Carlos, but--\"\\n\\n \"Have they been good boys?\" Tara arched an eyebrow. \"Not.\"\\n\\n \"So, if Carlos steps to you, look him dead in the eye and tell him the truth. \u0027I heard all your shit. It broke my heart. This new brother turned me on, and I\u0027m only human.\u0027 \"\\n\\n Damali paced away from her. \"Whew. Just like that?\"\\n\\n \"You carry the sharpest blade on the planet, darliri\u0027, and I take it you know how to back someone up off of you with a direct slice. You\u0027d better learn to use your tongue that way, too. Gore them if they pressure you.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, shit, girl, you\u0027re lethal.\"\\n\\n Tara shrugged. \"Deadly when provoked.\" She smiled a wicked smile. \"Tell that other panting bastard in the woods that he\u0027s been no angel.\\n\\n You\u0027re flesh and blood, and aren\u0027t an angel, either. Make sure he understands, just like his male mind has probably told several entities in Nod, \u0027Baby you knew what this was going in.\u0027 \" \"Chile . . .\"\\n\\n \"No, you\u0027d better hear me. I know you\u0027re saying, \u0027Oh, but he hasn\u0027t been with anyone and is so lonely\u0027 Right?\" \"Yeah, I kinda feel bad, and he\u0027s--\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s male. There are female entities over there. Get real. As wise and sexy and passionate as he is, he has not been celibate for centuries, trust me. Yonnie ran the same game on me, but ultimately pacified himself at Gabrielle\u0027s establishment until I made up my mind. He didn\u0027t die because he didn\u0027t get any from me. Cain will live. Puhlease. So will Carlos.\"\\n\\n Damali stared at Tara for a moment, truly dumbfounded. \"But he said ...\"\\n\\n \"All right,\" Tara replied, her tone impatient. \"So he hasn\u0027t had a woman in the flesh in a while, but I\u0027d dare say that he\u0027s learned how to fine tune his mental capacities to a point whereby he has a string of quivering, etheric concubines that are so-called friends. I hate to break it to you, sis, but you\u0027re just new--and that\u0027s what is blowing his mind. New always does that for a man.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, shit,\" Damali whispered. \"He played me!\"\\n\\n \"No. You played yourself. That\u0027s different,\" Tara said coolly, now studying her nails. \"He told you what you wanted to hear. You decided to believe him without thorough investigation. You were highly flattered. He seemed lost, trapped, intense, hot, in need of salvation, and came at you during a moment when you were worn down and emotionally exhausted by Carlos\u0027s drama, and therefore vulnerable. Old game. Executed very professionally.\"\\n\\n \"How could I be so--\" \"Don\u0027t be too hard on yourself and definitely don\u0027t beat yourself up. Happens to the best of us, and that\u0027s what they bank on.\" Tara\u0027s tone grew peevish, as though revisiting her old hurts as she spoke. \"You\u0027re not stupid, just green, and that\u0027s not a crime. It\u0027s an understandable oversight for a loving, honest, trusting woman to make. If Cain came seeking me, Yonnie would just have to get over it.\"\\n\\n Tara looked up and Damali burst out laughing.\\n\\n \"Girl, you wouldn\u0027t!\"\\n\\n Tara scoffed. \"Like Hell.\"\\n\\n They both laughed, now unconcerned about the volume of their mirth. Let \u0027em twist.\\n\\n \"You only become totally committed once they\u0027ve become totally committed,\" Tara said calmly, holding Damali\u0027s gaze. \"Once they cease playing games, you cease playing the field. The universe is very large. You are very young and very eligible and extremely attractive. You have fabulous gifts and an awesome career. Are you ready for babies and ready to hang up your blade?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Damali said without hesitation.\\n\\n \"Why do you think they keep trying to get you pregnant?\" For a moment, Damali couldn\u0027t answer. \"First it was daywalkers, then--\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, yeah, yeah,\" Tara said with a wave of her hand, dismissing Damali\u0027s answer. \"They want what you sire just as much as having you on permanent lockdown, your focus always on them and what they\u0027re doing, which keeps you under control.\"\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n Tara smiled, vindicated. \"No different than a mate bite in my world, new life in yours is pure Light that links and binds forever.\"\\n\\n \"That is too wild, Tara,\" Damali said, now pacing. \"Like a territory marker? Oh, girl. . .\"\\n\\n \"The core issue is,\" Tara continued calmly, \"once that happens, a woman\u0027s career changes, because her focus changes--I don\u0027t care what they tell you, ask your mother-seer or Marjorie. The woman takes the weight.\"\\n\\n Tara paused to allow her words to implode with impact. \"The man-- married or not, is still relatively free, more or less; the woman is not, if she has children. We are conditioned to marry to have children or to simply have children--but the procreation imperative is real. So take your time deciding, and only do it when you\u0027re ready to take the weight. Always be prepared to do that, because at any given time, you might have to do that solo. Don\u0027t go into that marriage or relationship equation blinded by love, promises, and passion, then on a gorgeous moonlit night, slip up and ooops. Vampire or not, if it\u0027s male, you must be at the ready to take the weight--that\u0027s why the choice must always be yours, and you never surrender control of that. Guard it like your blade, girl.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t even know what to say to you, Tara,\" Damali admitted. \"The queens were telling me this, Marlene... but up until now, it wasn\u0027t sinking in--because I was in love! Oh, shit, I\u0027m so mad... so pissed off, I can\u0027t believe--\"\\n\\n \"Well, believe it, because it\u0027s innate, in female DNA, something at the cellular level that seeks peace and harmony. I may not be a mother, but from my observation, the female\u0027s focus becomes the one thing in the world that she values more than anything else, her child. She will try to home to that biological father, no matter how crazy he is, how ridiculous he behaves, or how off the wall his family may be, she\u0027ll give it a good try before walking away. During the interim, while she figures it all out, he has control. She will suffer many indignities, just to keep the unit intact. Reasonable women have nearly lost their minds trying to do that while the baby\u0027s daddy did whatever.\"\\n\\n Tara shuddered. \"The only thing that makes me feel better is you used the past tense, \u0027was,\u0027 when you referred to being in love.\"\\n\\n \"I did?\" Damali said quiedy. \"Damn... I did, didn\u0027t I?\" Tara nodded slowly. \"Yeah, because now your head is getting twisted back on straight. But think about this, how many women have had their bright star of potential prematurely eclipsed because of this sort of crap? It\u0027s not that having children is a bad thing; in fact, it\u0027s one of the most profound gifts that I\u0027m bitterly sorry that I can\u0027t share in. So, I\u0027m not blaming the children,\" she added in a huff. \"But with this gift comes responsibility, so nobody but the one who has the responsibility for dealing with it should be in your face rushing your choice. Got it? How many years have talented women wasted embroiled in domestic struggles, rather than focusing on their gifts or even their children?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s why the queens took my blade . . .\" Damali stood gaping at Tara with her hand slowly going to her mouth. \"The whole blade ordeal was really them sending me a double message. The blade represented all of that. Wow . . .\"\\n\\n \"Doesn\u0027t your Isis cut both ways? The blade was simply an example, a harsh one ,a metaphor, but not as hard as the real lesson they were trying to tech. Don\u0027t all relationships have a double-edged blade to them-passion that cuts so good but also cuts so badly and deeply when misused?\"\\n\\n Tara tucked a stray wisp of her hair behind her ear. \"Damali, I\u0027ve had years to ponder these things, and the moment you ran it down to us ladies in this very house, I knew exactly what the old girls were trying to tell ya. But for the same reasons Marlene and Marj wouldn\u0027t just spit it out, I kept my mouth shut, too. Some lessons are so personal they can only be learned from experience. If we would have tried to tell you, you would have told us that Carlos wasn\u0027t like that, blah, blah, blah, so we zipped our hps. So, yeah, I would have slapped your face to get you to wake up and taken your Isis, too, were I on the Queens Council, to save you from yourself, if I could,\" Tara said, her tone firm. \"At twenty-one, had I known what I know now... Rider wouldn\u0027t have had to merely worry about Yonnie. Believe that.\" Tara chuckled. \"Before you slaughtered them all, there were several very eligible masters available.\" Both women laughed again hard.\\n\\n \"The mission first; this yang later.\" Damali shook her head. \"Basic.\"\\n\\n \"And... if you happen to experience a lapse along the way,\" Tara said with a grin, \"your answer will be?\"\\n\\n \"Aw... Baaaby... C\u0027mon, now... don\u0027t be like that. I\u0027m only human.\"\\n\\n \"Good,\" Tara said, coming to Damali to hug her. \"Now sit your butt down on this bed and let me tell you what is really going on.\" Damali sat slowly. Tara flopped beside her.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m a wreck,\" Tara said flatly. She covered her ears and squeezed her eyes shut. \"Put me in a prayer seal so I can speak.\"\\n\\n Damali murmured a quick prayer, and touched Tara\u0027s arm when she was done. Tara wiped the sweat away from her brow.\\n\\n \"See,\" Tara said weakly. \"It\u0027s getting worse. Even I can\u0027t deal with a prayer seal for long. I\u0027m out of this room in a moment.\"\\n\\n \"What happened?\"\\n\\n \"While you were getting the best siphon of your life, Gabby sent us two initiates. One is a virgin, slated for Dan, one was with Bobby, and the two young bucks went ga-ga and added them to the team.\" Damali was on her feet. \"What? Carlos did it while--\" \"Relax. They check out, and come with powers. The problem is Lilith is reconstituting the Vampire Council.\" Tara looked down at her hands and her voice became quiet. \"She\u0027ll make Yonnie an offer he can\u0027t refuse... and if she does, I don\u0027t know if I can pull away from him.\" She glanced up at Damali and cupped her cheek. \"That\u0027s why, while I\u0027m still able to help you and can be in your corner, I\u0027m saying all these things to you.\" Her hand fell away and her sad gaze drifted toward the door. \"I love you, Damali. But you know what a councilman\u0027s wife must do, right?\"\\n\\n Damali held both of Tara\u0027s hands and then brought them to her lips. \"I know. You have to ensure his power is never challenged.\"\\n\\n Tara closed her eyes. \"I will also have to feed properly to do that... as will he.\" She shuddered. \"In all these years, I was able to avoid it, and I held out hope that one night, we\u0027d be free.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t give up--not yet. Not now. Just--\"\\n\\n \"Damali... your heart is as big as Rider\u0027s. If Yonnie descends, you have to let me go. I will feed that first night, and it won\u0027t be deer.\" Tara\u0027s fingers traced the side of Damali\u0027s face and she pushed a lock behind her ear. \"The other night, I felt Lilith\u0027s rise. I could feel new energy hit the throne level of Level Six, and . . .\"\\n\\n Tara\u0027s words trailed off as she stood and walked across the room. \"It was female energy, Level Seven that slammed a throne. The energy went to me, first, as she pulled at the dark filaments in Carlos\u0027s line.\" She looked at Damali, who was now sitting, and held her gaze with solid red eyes glowing. \"I was out of my skull with need for a body, and begged him, sobbing at V-point to bring me one. That\u0027s when I knew something was wrong and so much stronger than me.\"\\n\\n Damali got up from the bed slowly and went to Tara to embrace her. \"I love you,\" was all she could say as her heart crumbled into a hundred pieces.\\n\\n \"Make it quick, is all I ask. I have no idea where my soul will bottom out.\" Tara\u0027s cool embrace rubbed pain into Damali\u0027s spine as she laid her head on Damali\u0027s shoulder. \"I don\u0027t know where Yonnie\u0027s will go, and mercy be unto him if he bottoms out in the were- demon realms. Carlos will have to make it a surgical strike.\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t think of you as anything else but a member of this team,\" Damali whispered with her eyes closed.\\n\\n \"The Light sent you two new female initiates from Gabrielle\u0027s and they will replace--\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Damali said quickly, holding Tara\u0027s arms and looking at her hard. \"They may add to the family, but will never take your places.\" She dropped her hold on Tara and began pacing. \"I so owe that bitch, Lilith... if she comes for either of you, I swear ...\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s coming,\" Tara said, her tone weary and resigned. \"Soon, there will be new master vampires, a new Chairman... the night is darker, denser.\"\\n\\n Damali nodded, hating that Tara was right. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-forsaken-vampire-huntress-legend-7/page-15.html","bookId":2531,"book":{"id":2531,"title":"The Forsaken (Vampire Huntress Legend #7)","description":"Storyline: The Forsaken (Vampire Huntress Legend #7) \\n The Chairman of the Vampire Council is dead, and Lilith, the consort of the Unnamed One, and the Unnamed One himself are out for revenge against Damali Richards, the Vampire Huntress, and her lover, Carlos Rivera.

There is only one entity who can best Damali, send Carlos packing, and put the Guardian team at mortal risk. This powerful being was once banished into a forsaken land and possesses everything that would bring a Neteru to his or her knees.
