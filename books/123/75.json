{"id":3271,"no":75,"title":"ACKNOWLEDGMENTS","content":"The last one was a bitch. This one was three bitches and a bastard. Once again, my thanks to my long-suffering editors and publishers: to Jane Johnson and Joy Chamberlain at Voyager, and Scott Shannon, Nita Taublib, and Anne Groell from Bantam. Their understanding, good humor, and sage advice helped through the tough bits, and I will never cease to be grateful for their patience. \n \n Thanks as well to my equally patient and endlessly supportive agents, Chris Lotts, Vince Gerardis, the fabulous Kay McCauley, and the late Ralph Vicinanza. Ralph, I wish you were here to share this day. \n \n And thanks to Stephen Boucher, the wandering Aussie who helps keep my computer greased and humming whenever he drops by Santa Fe for a breakfast burrito (Xmas) and a side of jalape?o bacon. \n \n Back here on the home front, thanks are also due to my dear friends Melinda Snodgrass and Daniel Abraham for their encouragement and support, to my webmaster Pati Nagle for maintaining my corner of the Internet, and to the amazing Raya Golden for the meals, the art, the unfailing good cheer that helped to brighten even the darkest days around Terrapin Station. Even if she did try to steal my cat. \n \n As long as it has taken me to dance this dance, it would surely have taken twice as long without the assistance of my faithful (and acerbic) minion and sometime traveling companion Ty Franck, who tends to my computer when Stephen’s not around, keeps the ravening virtual mobs from my virtual doorstep, runs my errands, does my filing, makes the coffee, walks the walk, and charges ten thousand dollars to change a light bulb—all while writing his own kick-ass books on Wednesdays. \n \n Last, but far from my least, all my love and gratitude to my wife, Parris, who has danced every step of this beside me. Love ya, Phipps. \n \n George R. R. Martin May 13, 2011 \n The End \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1635/48413.html","bookId":123,"book":{"id":123,"title":"冰与火之歌:魔龙的狂舞 A Dance with Dragons","description":"简介： 第五卷《魔龙的狂舞》（A Dance with Dragons）于2011年出版，故事与卷四《群鸦的盛宴》同步进行，主要讲述在火龙重新现世的同时众人的经历。史坦尼斯拜拉席恩开始在北境和波顿家族进行对抗，假意臣服铁王座的北境封臣则开始了暗下运作，而受尽折辱的席恩葛雷乔伊则在自...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201609/01/14-37-11-90-1.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1635","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM"}}
