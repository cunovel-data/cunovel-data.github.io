{"id":83028,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"~MARI~\n When I\u0027m done pulling on my jeans and tee shirt, I bend over to find my boots. I kicked them under my desk the other night. When I pull them out, I see a piece of paper caught between the desk and the wall. I reach for it, instantly knowing what it is - Trystan\u0027s song. How\u0027d it get on the floor? I go to pin it back in place, but decide that it shouldn\u0027t be where anyone could get it. If my parents took the song or Brie managed to get her hands on it, that\u0027d be bad. So I take it with me, stuffing it into my jeans pocket.\n I get to school early and head to find Trystan. The halls are empty. I pull open the basement door and run down the stairs. After that kiss this morning, I have a kiss of my own to give him. But when I reach the bottom of the landing, I freeze. He\u0027s singing softly. His back is turned to me, like he doesn\u0027t know I\u0027m there. After a moment, he glances back at me and startles.\n \"Hey, ninja. Fancy meeting you here.\" Trystan\u0027s eyes sweep over me in a way that makes me feel beautiful.\n \"I heard there was a rock star living in the school basement. I had to see it for myself.\" I smile at him and drop my bag on the couch. Walking over to him slowly, I swing my leg over his lap and sit. We nearly fall off the little stool. He laughs and holds onto me with the guitar between us. \"This was more romantic in my head.\"\n He grins. Hard. \"Kiss me, Mari.\"\n The way he says it makes my heart jump. My stomach twists and that empty space inside my chest fills with warmth. I\u0027m beaming at him, moving in slowly, crushing the guitar between us. My lips brush against his and then he\u0027s kissing me back. Trystan\u0027s hands find my face and he holds onto me, encouraging me, wanting me. My heart pounds harder and harder. I wish there was nothing but this moment now. I can understand this. I can deal with this. Everything else can fade away and I\u0027d be happy. When we come up for air, I slip off his lap.\n Trystan moans and puts the guitar back. \"I wasn\u0027t done with you.\"\n I\u0027m still flushed. My lips are too sensitive. I can still feel his lips on my mouth. I smile and shake my head. I know how much it will devastate him if anyone saw the marks on his neck. \"You need make-up first. Kisses later.\"\n He gives me a funny look. \"I never thought I\u0027d hear that sentence.\"\n I laugh. He tugs a loop on the waistband of my jeans and pulls me close. His hands lace through my hair and he kisses me again. I don\u0027t want to pull away. I moan and say, \"We\u0027re running out of time.\"\n He sighs and gives me a serious look. \"What if we just said you gave me some really wicked hickeys?\" That makes me laugh even louder. The smile that stretches across his face when I laugh is beautiful. It\u0027s Trystan without anything hindering him or weighing him down.\n I shove him back down to the stool. \"Sit. Let me do this before the bell rings.\"\n \"Fine, but you\u0027re going to have to talk about something else. A guy only has so much self-control, and your chest is right in front of my face. Honestly, I\u0027m having a lot of trouble not jumping on you and covering you in kisses.\" He smirks, his eyes still way below my neckline.\n The way he says it is so casual, like he might actually do it. Part of me wants him to. My pulse is racing, making it so I only hear the steady, swift, beating and my breaths. I reach toward him and take his chin in my hand and tilt it up to my face. His blue gaze is dazzling. It\u0027s like someone\u0027s lit a flame inside of him and it\u0027s shining through his eyes. Trystan grins at me.\n \"You are impossible. You do know that, right?\" I\u0027m breathing too hard, flustered beyond belief. Trystan loves it. I can see it in his eyes.\n I dab and blend until the ugly marks around his neck are gone. They fading fast, but the colors are worse. Now there\u0027s an ample amount of green and yellow mixed with the blues and blacks. I finish his make-up and he stands and turns toward me. \"I can\u0027t wait for tonight, for that scene that includes kissing you senseless on stage in front of dozens of people. I\u0027m really looking forward to it.\"\n I can\u0027t help it. The way he\u0027s looking at me makes me feel giddy. I slap his chest lightly. Trystan grabs my wrist and pulls me toward him, careful not to squeeze me too tight. \"You would be - \"\n \"So are you. I can see it in your eyes.\" I tear my gaze away from him, suddenly feeling very nervous. Trystan takes my chin and turns me back. \"No one knows, love.\" He kisses my bottom lip. \"They think we\u0027re acting.\" He kisses my top lip. \"Only we know it\u0027s real.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shattered-the-secret-life-of-trystan-scott-4/page-13.html","bookId":1875,"book":{"id":1875,"title":"Shattered (The Secret Life of Trystan Scott #4)","description":"Storyline: \n I run.
