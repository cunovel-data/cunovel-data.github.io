{"id":83020,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"~MARI~ When Trystan pulls away, it feels like my lungs have been ripped out of my throat. I don\u0027t understand why he does it. My heart races frantically, and won\u0027t calm down. Trystan bends forward and lowers his head like he\u0027s praying. He doesn\u0027t look up right away. I want to take him in my arms and fix this, but I know I can\u0027t. There are too many things bottled up inside of him, too many thoughts that I don\u0027t know. So, I do the only thing that I know to do. I stand up and smooth my shirt back into place. My middle is still sore as hell, but I\u0027d rather die than pass up the chance to have Trystan\u0027s hands on me. \"Come on, Scott,\" I say, grabbing a pillow off the couch. The thing is old, huge, and heavy. Trystan glances at me from the corner of his eye. I waive the pillow at him. It nearly knocks me off balance. \"I\u0027m serious, Scott. We both have shitty lives. Mine is covered in glitz so people don\u0027t bother to notice, but I\u0027m not stupid. And I\u0027m not letting you give in to it. Get up.\" When Trystan doesn\u0027t move, I swing the pillow at him. I try to do it gently, but there is no gently with these things. It\u0027s too big. The pillow hits him in the side of the face and makes a smacking sound. Trystan actually sways sideways. He glances at me with a shocked look on his face. The corners of my lips curl up. \"You know you liked it.\" I waggle my eyebrows at him and he laughs. Trystan stands and plucks a pillow from the couch, but not before I have the chance to whack him again. The pillow is too heavy. It pulls me forward every time I swing. When it smacks Trystan, it sounds like I hit him with a ream of paper. He rounds on me with that boyish grin on his face, and then nearly falls over. I laugh, but Trystan already has his footing back. He taps me lightly with his pillow, like I might break. \"What the hell was that, Scott?\" I tease him and bounce on the balls of my feet. I taunt him and say, \"Play like you mean it.\" \"You like it rough?\" The corner of his mouth twitches. \"No holding back. Not now. Not ever.\" I say the words and know that I\u0027m not talking about a pillow fight. I\u0027m talking about us, about what\u0027s happening between us and to us. I don\u0027t want to give up and I don\u0027t want to lose him. I swipe my pillow at his arm. It took a mega-swing to get momentum, but I manage. When the pillow collides with Trystan, he staggers to the side before dropping his pillow. His blue eyes are crystal clear. Trystan steps toward me, pulls the pillow from my hands, and slides his palms up my cheeks and then tangles his fingers in my hair. A rush of tingles shoots through my middle. I can\u0027t breathe. Trystan looks at me like I\u0027m air and that he can\u0027t breathe without me. He brings our faces closer, so slowly that it feels like I\u0027m going to die, but then our lips touch and everything changes. Butterflies fill my stomach. They swoop inside of me, making me giddy. The spots on my face where his palms touch my skin are electrified. A current shoots through me and makes me tingle. And his lips, oh God, his lips - they press lightly at first. His mouth is so soft, his lips are so full. It\u0027s like that kiss when we were rehearsing, and then suddenly it\u0027s not. Trystan stops holding back. His desperation hits me hard. The tension in his arms flows into his hands and onto my cheeks as he tightens his grip. The heat from his body encompasses me and I\u0027m lost, falling through space. My eyes close and little white spots flicker behind my eyes. His hands slip over my skin and carefully move down my back and under my shirt. I gasp and press my mouth harder to his. The kiss is urgent, demanding. It\u0027s like we both know our time together is limited and everything is going to change. I can\u0027t stop and I don\u0027t want to. Heat seers under my skin as Trystan\u0027s hands slip over me. His tongue licks the seam of my lips, teasing me. My heart beats harder, and drowns out every other sound. When I open my mouth and let him, I feel my body going limp in his arms. Trystan holds me to his chest and kisses me harder, deeper. His tongue moves in my mouth and I\u0027m floating and falling at the same time. I don\u0027t come up for air. I\u0027m afraid he\u0027ll stop. I\u0027m afraid of what will happen next. I\u0027m afraid... Trystan barely breathes as the kiss endures. It\u0027s seeking, giving, and hoping. It\u0027s everything that I though a kiss should be, but he pulls away too soon. Trystan\u0027s face is flushed. Heat fills his cheeks and he breathes like he\u0027s run too far, too fast. His fingers brush my cheek and rest on my shoulder. \"I love you, Mari.\" His sapphire gaze locks with mine. We hold each other. We say nothing. The moment remains perfect, as if it\u0027s suspended in time. We cling to each other, hoping to God that there\u0027s more for us, that there\u0027s a way I can hold onto him. But, Trystan is like a snowflake. I\u0027m afraid that if I try to close my hand around him, he\u0027ll disappear from my life. Trystan can\u0027t accept who he is, that it stems from where he came from. He won\u0027t forgive himself for this. Somehow I know it, but I can\u0027t let it go. I can\u0027t let him go. I love him with every ounce of my being, and I know that I always will.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shattered-the-secret-life-of-trystan-scott-4/page-5.html","bookId":1875,"book":{"id":1875,"title":"Shattered (The Secret Life of Trystan Scott #4)","description":"Storyline: I run.

When Trystan pulls the door open, it seems like he is going to walk out, which is strange since he\u0027s not wearing a shirt and his hair is damp. I glance at his face - his blue eyes are wild.
