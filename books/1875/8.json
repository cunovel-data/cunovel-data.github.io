As soon as Mari disappears from sight he hisses, \"I thought you were over her?\"\\n\\n Trystan keeps that distant look in his eye. He never tells Seth much of anything. The guy panics. He wants Trystan\u0027s life to make sense to him, but it doesn\u0027t. Hell, it doesn\u0027t even make sense to Trystan. How is he supposed to explain anything to the guy?\\n\\n \"Maybe I\u0027m just friends with her,\" Trystan says, \"and maybe I don\u0027t want to rehash this whole thing with you tonight. Do me a favor, okay? If you still can\u0027t stand her on Monday, tell me and we can discuss it then.\" Trystan says, pushing his hair out of his eyes. \"From the way your acting, it seems like you liked Brie better.\"\\n\\n Seth\u0027s eyes get a little too big for his head. \"You\u0027re into her, too? Damn man.\" He grins. \"You think you can get \u0027em both at once?\"\\n\\n Trystan\u0027s fingers flinch. Instead of slugging his friend, he smiles and nods. Trystan says things he doesn\u0027t mean, wishing for things he doesn\u0027t want. Mari and Brie. As if that was something to hope for. Trystan shakes off the skeeved layer sticking to his skin and changes the subject. \"I heard you were talking about enlisting?\"\\n\\n Trystan couldn\u0027t believe it. When they were in lab, he heard a teacher mentioning Seth\u0027s lack of teacher recommendation forms. The teacher from across the hall said Seth was enlisting. It was weird to find out that way.\\n\\n Seth doesn\u0027t look a Trystan. Instead, he nods and says, \"Yeah, I mean, it\u0027s not like I\u0027m a nerd and can get into a good college. Besides, I haven\u0027t got cash for that kind of shit.\"\\n\\n \"I know what you mean.\" Trystan and Seth weave their way through the school as they talk, and then exit the front of the building. The air is crisp, like it might snow. There are about two hours until he has to be at Mari\u0027s house. Two hours to kill with Seth. He breathes in deeply and runs his fingers through his hair. \"I was going to enlist, but I don\u0027t know anymore...\"\\n\\n Seth gives him a look. \"Dude, you\u0027re seriously going to let me enlist by myself? Why do you think I went to the recruiter?\"\\n\\n Trystan gives his friend an awkward smile, \"Thanks, but there is no way you should enlist to hang out with me. I\u0027m headed nowhere too fast.\"\\n\\n Seth laughs, \"Well, it\u0027s better to have company along the way. I mean, who else is going to be your wing man when they send you to China or some shit?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think we have troops in China.\" Trystan glances at Seth and tries not to smile. The guy is about to sign on the dotted line and has no idea about anything, which sounds about right for Seth. \"Besides, I might not enlist anyway. I\u0027ve been thinking about doing something else.\"\\n\\n \"Like...?\" Seth asks, knowing as well as Trystan does that there aren\u0027t many options. Neither of them is exceptionally anything.\\n\\n Trystan shrugs. \"The hell if I know. I\u0027m just saying, don\u0027t enlist because of me. There\u0027s a chance I\u0027m not going to do it.\"\\n\\n Seth is staring at a car full of girls in track uniforms. Seth and the girls are hollering at each other. The man isn\u0027t even listening anymore. The girls pull over to the side of the road. \"Hey hotties! Want a ride?\" One girl asks and they all start giggling. Seth\u0027s eyes go wide, like he\u0027s being called to the mother-ship.\\n\\n Trystan grabs Seth\u0027s arm and waves them off, \"Not tonight, ladies.\" The car full of girls takes off, leaving behind streamers of white smoke and giggles.\\n\\n \"What the hell was that for? What\u0027d I ever do to you?\" Seth whines.\\n\\n \"I want to eat dinner. Plus I gotta be somewhere in an hour, so get your ass moving or I\u0027ll have to eat without you.\" Trystan starts walking again. Seth waits a beat, and then follows. Trystan has eight bucks in his pocket. It\u0027s the last of his money from Sam. He\u0027ll have to go bust his ass after school next week and earn more.\\n\\n \"You have something set up?\" Seth asks, his voice filled with innuendo.\\n\\n Trystan shoves his hands in his pockets and stares straight ahead, wishing the diner would materialize and suck them through the front doors so he wouldn\u0027t have to take part in this conversation. \"Something.\"\\n\\n \"Way to be vague, Scott. Come on, man, who\u0027s the lucky girl? You think she\u0027ll put out?\"\\n\\n Trystan smirks and laughs. That\u0027s the last thing that he expects to happen. The night will probably be filled with Mari\u0027s voice and lips, and maybe if he\u0027s lucky, her dad won\u0027t come home early and beat the shit out of him. Repeating last night is the last thing he wants to do. But still, it\u0027s worth the risk. Deciding to go to Mari\u0027s is one of the stupider things he\u0027s done.\\n\\n \"Come on, Trystan. Give names, man. Who are you gonna nail?\" Seth yips like a dog, begging for scraps. He\u0027s relentless and doesn\u0027t stop until they walk into the diner. He scans the booths for girls they know. \"Nicole\u0027s over there.\" Seth says, hopeful.\\n\\n \"So go sit with her if you want. I\u0027ll be over here.\" Trystan points, and follows the waitress. Seth seems to be stuck. You could see the guy getting pulled in two directions.\\n\\n Seth finally follows Trystan to the booth and sits down. He grabs a menu and then something weird happens.\\n\\n The girl sitting across from them says, \"If it\u0027s not my two favorite idiots.\" Katie sweeps her long hair over her shoulder, tosses a tip on the table and walks over. \"How\u0027s it hanging, Trystan?\" She places her fingers on their table and cocks her head to the side. \"Cuz if you mess with my girl Mari, I\u0027m gonna make you wish - \"\\n\\n \"Mari\u0027s at home, and I didn\u0027t do anything to her.\" Trystan says, tightly. He wonders what Katie knows, if anything. She\u0027s Mari\u0027s best friend. They\u0027re always together.\\n\\n Seth is watching Katie a little too closely. \"Hey kitten, you want me to make you purr?\" Seth grins at her and sweeps his eyes over her body, lingering way too long on her breasts.\\n\\n Katie\u0027s mouth falls open. When she snaps back to life, Katie swings her purse and pegs Seth in the side of the head. He makes a noise like a pig bouncing out of the back of a pickup truck, and then clutches his head between his hands. \"What. The. Fuck.\" He glares at Katie.\\n\\n Katie\u0027s pissed. Her jaw is locked and when she talks, she sounds like she\u0027ll rip his face off. \"Don\u0027t talk to me, Seth. So help me God - \"\\n\\n Katie is interrupted by the waiter. \"Is there a problem over here?\" the waiter asks, looking at each of them in turn.\\n\\n Trystan beams and shakes his head. \"Nope. We\u0027re ready to order though.\" He goes ahead, ordering three plates of food, fries, and shakes. When the waiter leaves, Trystan points at Katie and then the booth. \"Sit down, Katie Scarlett,\" he says with a thick Irish brogue.\\n\\n She lifts a dark brow at him. The girl could eat them alive. She\u0027d spit out their bones and ask for seconds. There\u0027s a fierce thing going on with her, that\u0027s for certain. \"You think I\u0027m that vapid skank from Gone with the Wind? Seriously?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Trystan replies with a smirk on his face. \"I just thought you liked big hats. Besides, that\u0027s the only famous Katie I know.\"\\n\\n Seth offers, \"Katie Couric.\"\\n\\n Trystan inclines his head toward Katie. They lock gazes. Katie\u0027s expression is telling Trystan to piss off, but that look tells him that he\u0027s right. She\u0027d happily slaughter them both with her purse. Seth got off easy. God help the poor bastard who dates this girl. \"Katie Couric doesn\u0027t have the same spunk as Katie Scarlett.\"\\n\\n \"Who the fuck is Katie Scarlett?\" Seth blurts out way too loud. That pretty much sums up dinner. Seth and Katie bicker for an hour and Trystan tries to derail everything by throwing them off their game. It works, but not for long. It\u0027s as though they like fighting with each other. Eventually, he just sits back and watches and develops a deep respect for Katie in the process. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shattered-the-secret-life-of-trystan-scott-4/page-8.html","bookId":1875,"book":{"id":1875,"title":"Shattered (The Secret Life of Trystan Scott #4)","description":"Storyline: I run.
