When Trystan saw Mari fall and his father\u0027s foot connect with her stomach, his brain broke. Red hot rage ran behind his eyes, blinding him. Before Trystan knew what happened, his father was on the floor. He remembers the steps toward his dad. He remembers the way it felt when his fist collided with the old man\u0027s jaw. Maybe dad deserved it. Maybe, but that isn\u0027t the emotion rolling over his skin. Trystan looks at his hand, still clenched tight. That fist. Oh god. He didn\u0027t want to fight back. Fighting back makes it worse. Fighting back makes him like his father. Trystan\u0027s stomach twists as he stares at nothing.\\n\\n After a moment, he sees her - Mari. She moves toward him. Shame covers him like a thick blanket. He didn\u0027t defend her fast enough. He didn\u0027t prevent this. He should have. When Mari falls against him, Trystan pulls her to him, touching her back and lacing his fingers through her hair. He saw the kick and knows how much she hurts. Trystan is careful not to make it worse, but he doesn\u0027t want to let go. Closing his eyes, he buries his face in her hair and breathes. It seems like hours pass this way.\\n\\n His life is so fucked up, so far beyond repair - and Mari walked straight into it. She saw him when he opened the door, but she didn\u0027t run. Mari came inside. She must have done something after he blacked out. The last thing Trystan remembers is his father\u0027s fingers around his throat and the liquid fire filling his lungs.\\n\\n Then, Trystan opened his eyes and the world was on its side. Mari was on the floor. It was too much. Trystan was too late. He didn\u0027t save her. He walked her into this mess, led her straight into it.\\n\\n Mari\u0027s hands are warm and hold onto him tightly. She doesn\u0027t hold back. It isn\u0027t until the cops arrive that they part, and it isn\u0027t willingly. Before Trystan knows what\u0027s happening, he\u0027s forced to the floor with a knee in his back. They say things to him, but the pain is making it hard to focus. He can\u0027t swallow. His entire throat burns and aches at the same time. It\u0027s like his neck was in a vice, but it wasn\u0027t. It was in his father\u0027s hands.\\n\\n They pull Trystan up and drag him into the kitchen. The wall blocks his view of Mari. Anger is coursing so wildly through his body that he can barely control it. The cops ask him questions, but he can\u0027t really speak. Each word is like a nail through his throat. The only things he can manage is, \"It\u0027s not her fault. I did this.\" They shove paper at him. Trystan knows better than to write anything down. He shakes his head.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be a dumbass kid. Write down what happened.\" The cop pushes the paper back at Trystan, but he doesn\u0027t take it. \"You\u0027re old man beat you one too many times. We know this story kid. The girl showed up and tried to help. Things got out of hand. I know how this goes. Tell us something.\" But Trystan is quiet.\\n\\n The cop glances through the doorway to the cops in the other room. He shakes his head once, and turns his attention back to Trystan. Another cop comes into the room. He\u0027s shaking his head, like he can\u0027t believe Trystan\u0027s so stupid.\\n\\n \"Are you a minor, kid?\" the new cop asks. Trystan shakes his head and wishes he didn\u0027t. It makes his head throb more. He mutters curse words under his breathe and looks back at Trystan\u0027s dad who is still lying on the floor.\\n\\n A few minutes later the paramedics arrive. Trystan doesn\u0027t want them to look at him, but the cops insist. There\u0027s no way to pay for this, but they look him over anyway.\\n\\n They tell Trystan that he\u0027ll be all right. They tell him that his father is awake and unharmed, but they are taking him in anyway. They repeat a question, \"You sure you didn\u0027t pass out? Not even for a second?\"\\n\\n Trystan mouths no. He lies. He isn\u0027t going to the damn emergency room. Trystan knows exactly where he\u0027s going as soon as the paramedics leave.\\n\\n \"Kid, we\u0027re going to have to bring you to the jail if you don\u0027t go with them. Blacking out would be normal. It\u0027s nothing to do with how much of a man you are.\" The cop looks at him. He doesn\u0027t understand. It isn\u0027t blacking out. It\u0027s that his private life is suddenly exposed. All those years of misery are out in the open. The only thing Trystan wanted was to get through the next couple of months and then go out on his own. This wasn\u0027t part of the plan.\\n\\n Mari appears in the doorway. \"I\u0027m not pressing charges.\" Trystan perks up in his chair, but the cop places a hand on his shoulder to keep him in place. There are two officers with Mari, walking her out to the car. She screamed the words as she passed by.\\n\\n Trystan says, \"But her father will.\"\\n\\n \"Smart boy. Come on. Let\u0027s get going. You\u0027re going to have a long night.\" The cop gestures for Trystan to stand and hold out his wrists. Cold metal bites into Trystan\u0027s skin when the handcuffs tighten. He blinks slowly, wondering how he ended up with this life. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shattered-the-secret-life-of-trystan-scott-4/page-2.html","bookId":1875,"book":{"id":1875,"title":"Shattered (The Secret Life of Trystan Scott #4)","description":"Storyline: I run.
