The cops don\u0027t want to throw him in jail, but they haven\u0027t released him yet, either. Trystan sits in the police station after questioning that took too long. He didn\u0027t say much. There wasn\u0027t much to say.\\n\\n The police station is busy even though it\u0027s getting late. It seems like the later it gets, the more stupid people become. Trystan is sitting in an old beat up wooden chair by the detective\u0027s desk. The cop sits next to him filling out paperwork, not saying much. Trystan\u0027s gaze is carefully placed on the floor where it can\u0027t attract trouble. His arms are folded over his chest and he\u0027s slumped back in his seat. There isn\u0027t anything that he wouldn\u0027t give to be somewhere else. This trip, this whole damn night, is going to ruin his shot at the army. Trystan stares at his toe, the once-white part of his Converse, as he thinks that plan was shot to hell anyway. Mari loves him. Mari wants to be with him.\\n\\n And now this.\\n\\n Trystan rubs his hands over his face and back through his hair. He stretches and looks over at the cop. \"Can I go?\" He\u0027s polite. It\u0027s a stupid question. After everything that happened, Trystan\u0027s sure they won\u0027t release him.\\n\\n \"Not yet, kid. Let me finish this and you can sign it. If the girl\u0027s family presses charges, we\u0027ll deal with it then. I don\u0027t want to throw you in a cell with the guys that are in there tonight. Too much shit has happened. They\u0027ll rip you apart before you even get a chance to turn around.\" The cop has a wrinkled dress shirt on. His tie is loosened around his neck. His face is covered in wrinkles and his skin weathered like old leather. There are too many creases and he has that smoky smell that comes from lighting up too many times each day. The cop doesn\u0027t look up at Trystan.\\n\\n This is the first time anyone told him what was going on. Since they dragged him into the station, no one said anything to him. Trystan doesn\u0027t want to ask, but he can\u0027t help it. \"Did they say if they\u0027re going to press charges?\"\\n\\n The cop nods, not looking up from his paperwork. \"Not yet, but she\u0027s a minor. They\u0027ll probably talk to their lawyer in the morning and we\u0027ll hear back then.\" He glances up at Trystan and points a pen at the string of bruises blossoming around Trystan\u0027s neck. \"From the look of things, it could have been a lot worse. You\u0027re lucky.\"\\n\\n Trystan laughs. The sound is so bitter that he can taste it. \"If that was lucky - \"\\n\\n The cop cuts him off. He looks straight at Trystan and narrows his eyes. \"Damn right, it was lucky. Lucky she showed up. Lucky your old man didn\u0027t break her ribs. Lucky you\u0027re still breathing. You were lucky, Trystan. No one else stepped in. That parking lot was filled with people. They all minded their own business and let your dad strangle you. That girl saved your ass.\" His old eyes hold Trystan\u0027s for a moment and his expression softens. \"If you\u0027ve got some family you can stay with until you graduate, do it. These things don\u0027t end well. Once you pass that point, once you fight back, there\u0027s just going to be more of it.\" Trystan holds the cop\u0027s gaze for a second and nods.\\n\\n Trystan gets what the detective is saying. Don\u0027t go home.\\n\\n Trystan slides down further in the seat. His arms are flexed tightly across his chest with his head lowered. It\u0027s the only way to hide the marks on his neck. He swallows hard and waits, thinking. Too many thoughts, too many images flood his mind. Everything in his life sucks, everything expect Mari.\\n\\n When Trystan thinks about what she did, how she raced in like she wasn\u0027t the least bit afraid - oh God. If there was a rewind button on life, Trystan would press it. He would go back and delete the whole thing. If he\u0027d never went home, this wouldn\u0027t have happened. As it is, it kills him that Mari was hurt and he couldn\u0027t stop it.\\n\\n There are too many things wrong with his life, too many things that he can\u0027t fix.\\n\\n A noise startles Trystan awake. He rolls over on the old couch and flinches. His shirt is on the floor and he\u0027s wearing nothing but his jeans and a tattered blanket from the prop bin. When Trystan had nowhere to go, he decided to break into the school and sleep in the prop room. No one comes down there early in the morning, which is confusing him now.\\n\\n Trystan blinks again and yawns. A pair of brown eyes and soft dark hair comes into focus. \"Mari?\" he asks, still half asleep. He wonders if he\u0027s dreaming. Trystan blinks again, but his throat is still aching. It feels like his body was ripped apart last night and reassembled. Add to that the shame he\u0027s feeling and Trystan can barely breathe.\\n\\n Mari reaches for him and smoothes her hand across his cheek. Her touch is warm, gentle. \"Did you sleep here?\" Her eyes slide over his chest and then back up to his face.\\n\\n Trystan stretches and sits up, letting the blanket fall from his body. He really doesn\u0027t want to answer. It isn\u0027t that he doesn\u0027t trust Mari, it\u0027s that he wishes that part of his life didn\u0027t exist. But, after last night he owes her. Trystan rubs the sleep from his eyes and says, \"Yeah. I had to. I couldn\u0027t go home.\"\\n\\n \"What happened last night after I left? I tried to stay, but they wouldn\u0027t let me do anything. The police treated me like a child. It...\" her gaze is on the side of his face. She lets out a sigh and closes her eyes for a second. When she reopens them again, Mari looks at the same spot on the floor as Trystan. They both have that vacant gaze.\\n\\n \"I was worried about you.\" She bumps his knees with hers.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m fine,\" Trystan says, but deep inside he\u0027s not fine. Somehow Mari got sucked into his private hell, and that makes it worse. Trystan couldn\u0027t stop it. When he finally passed out on the couch last night, the whole nightmare unfolded again and again as he dreamed. That\u0027s the problem with his life, there is no escaping it, not even in sleep. Trystan glances past Mari, looking for his shirt. \"What about you? Did your Dad...\"\\n\\n Mari stirs and sees his shirt. She reaches for it and hands it to him. Trystan pulls the fabric over his head as she speaks, but her eyes lift to his neck and lock there. She can\u0027t tear her gaze away. \"Dad doesn\u0027t listen to me. He doesn\u0027t hit me, but sometimes I think he will. Oh God, Trystan. Why didn\u0027t you tell me? I had no idea - \"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s a reason why you had no idea. I love you, Mari, I really do - but I can\u0027t talk about this. It isn\u0027t something that I want to share. I\u0027m completely horrified that you walked into it. I\u0027m horrified that he hurt you. I...\" Trystan\u0027s jaw drops open and for the first time since it happened, he really looks at Mari. He meets her gaze and holds it. She\u0027s his refuge. Mari is his glue, his balm, his other half. Her brown eyes are wide. Her narrow fingers are gripped tightly in front of her waist, like she thinks she did something wrong. \"I just want to get past it and now I can\u0027t even hide it. Everyone is going to see my neck and know.\"\\n\\n Mari is wearing an oversized flannel shirt. Without a word, she unbuttons it, revealing the cami beneath. Trystan doesn\u0027t realize what she\u0027s doing until she holds out the flannel to him. \"Take it. It has a collar. And I have access to the stage make-up. That will cover up the marks in front. No one will know. Everything will be okay.\" Even as she says it, Trystan knows Mari doesn\u0027t believe it. There\u0027s a look in her eye, but he doesn\u0027t press her about it. Instead he nods and takes the shirt, grateful.\\n\\n Mari changes the subject and talks about other things while she dabs thick, cold, goopy, foundation on his neck. This will work. It covers everything. Her fingers are so soft and work so fast. Trystan waits until she stops talking and asks, \"What made you come here this morning? School doesn\u0027t start for another hour or more.\" Part of him thinks that she was looking for him. The other part thinks something happened, something with her dad.\\n\\n Mari\u0027s shoulders tense. She stands taller and her eyes dart away. He\u0027s right. Fuck, he didn\u0027t want to be right. She licks her lips and finishes covering up his mangled neck. \"I had to get out of my house. You know how it is.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, I know.\" He\u0027s quiet for a moment.\\n\\n Mari is wearing one of those cami\u0027s with the lace at the top. It hugs her body, closely fitting to every curve. His eyes drink her in. In the back of Trystan\u0027s mind, he knows that he\u0027s going to lose her. Life isn\u0027t fair and he knows that, but losing her so soon is unbearable.\\n\\n Mari\u0027s dark hair falls down her back in a cascade of thick curls. They sway and fall over her shoulder as she works. Mari moves around him, not feeling his eyes on her skin as she picks up the make-up and puts it back in the kit. Trystan feels so torn. He needs her, but she\u0027d be so much better off without him. Trystan has nothing to offer her. He only brings pain and shame. He swallows hard, trying to ignore the guilt that\u0027s choking him.\\n\\n When Mari turns around, she has a soft smile on her lips. She isn\u0027t afraid of him. She doesn\u0027t pity him. Mari acts like Trystan is the same guy he was yesterday, before she learned his secret. She sits down next to him and helps him pull her shirt on. It was too big on her, but it\u0027s about the right size for him. She buttons it up, a few of the top buttons she leaves open, and smiles at him.\\n\\n Mari places her hand over his heart and says, \"No one will know.\"\\n\\n Their eyes lock. A rush of emotion floods through him. Trystan feels too much. After everything that happened, he just wants to hold onto her and never let go. Acting on the urge, Trystan leans in and gathers Mari in his arms and holds her tight. She winces as he does it, which makes him let go. \"You\u0027re hurt.\"\\n\\n Trystan\u0027s blue gaze slips over the cami. He doesn\u0027t see anything. Slowly, he inches his hand toward the hem of her shirt. Mari is very still, her dark eyes tracking his hands as he takes the bottom of her cami and slowly slides it up. An angry purple mark mars her perfectly pale skin. He can\u0027t breathe. Things can\u0027t be like this. She\u0027s hurt because of him. He shouldn\u0027t do this. He shouldn\u0027t be here with her and he sure as hell shouldn\u0027t be touching her, but he can\u0027t stop. It\u0027s still early. No one is here. Trystan could slide his fingers along her soft skin and press his lips to hers. She could take him away from here with a taste of those lips. Trystan could be higher than high in a heartbeat if he just leaned in and kissed her.\\n\\n Mari\u0027s eyes drift to his lips. His hands are still on her shirt, his fingers are so close to her skin that it aches not to touch her. Mari takes a jagged breath and looks up at him. Her eyes are molten chocolate. They shimmer with golden heat. The way she looks at him makes Trystan\u0027s heart beat harder. Suddenly, he\u0027s hot all over. His body is responding to her. He wants to lean in. Trystan wants to be with her, but he doesn\u0027t move.\\n\\n Trystan\u0027s lips are a breath from Mari\u0027s. The stay like that too long, impossibly long. Lingering thoughts tease him, telling him to take what he needs - that she\u0027ll let him - that Mari needs him just as much. But he can\u0027t. He can\u0027t drag her into this more than he already has. Guilt juts up between them like a wall.\\n\\n Trystan blinks and breaks their gaze. He turns his face away from Mari without explanation. He sucks in air and runs his hands through his hair and down the back of his neck.\\n\\n She deserves so much more. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shattered-the-secret-life-of-trystan-scott-4/page-4.html","bookId":1875,"book":{"id":1875,"title":"Shattered (The Secret Life of Trystan Scott #4)","description":"Storyline: I run.
