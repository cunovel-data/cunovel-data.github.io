{"id":40488,"no":12,"title":"Chapter 12 The Return to the Ship.","content":"At this moment a man, almost dead, dragged himself out of the hut and along the ice. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was Louis Cornbutte. \\n\\n \\n\\n “My son!” \\n\\n \\n\\n “My beloved!” \\n\\n \\n\\n These two cries were uttered at the same time, and Louis Cornbutte fell fainting into the arms of his father and Marie, who drew him towards the hut, where their tender care soon revived him. \\n\\n \\n\\n “My father! Marie!” cried Louis; “I shall not die without having seen you!” \\n\\n \\n\\n “You will not die!” replied Penellan, “for all your friends are near you.” \\n\\n \\n\\n André Vasling must have hated Louis Cornbutte bitterly not to extend his hand to him, but he did not. \\n\\n \\n\\n Pierre Nouquet was wild with joy. He embraced every body; then he threw some wood into the stove, and soon a comfortable temperature was felt in the cabin. \\n\\n \\n\\n There were two men there whom neither Jean Cornbutte nor Penellan recognized. \\n\\n \\n\\n They were Jocki and Herming, the only two sailors of the crew of the Norwegian schooner who were left. \\n\\n \\n\\n “My friends, we are saved!” said Louis. “My father! Marie! You have exposed yourselves to so many perils!” \\n\\n \\n\\n “We do not regret it, my Louis,” replied the father. “Your brig, the ‘Jeune–Hardie,’ is securely anchored in the ice sixty leagues from here. We will rejoin her all together.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “When Courtois comes back he’ll be mightily pleased,” said Pierre Nouquet. \\n\\n \\n\\n A mournful silence followed this, and Penellan apprised Pierre and Louis of their comrade’s death by cold. \\n\\n \\n\\n “My friends,” said Penellan, “we will wait here until the cold decreases. Have you provisions and wood?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Yes; and we will burn what is left of the ‘Fro?ern.’” \\n\\n \\n\\n The “Fro?ern” had indeed been driven to a place forty miles from where Louis Cornbutte had taken up his winter quarters. There she was broken up by the icebergs floated by the thaw, and the castaways were carried, with a part of the débris of their cabin, on the southern shores of Shannon Island. \\n\\n \\n\\n They were then five in number — Louis Cornbutte, Courtois, Pierre Nouquet, Jocki, and Herming. As for the rest of the Norwegian crew, they had been submerged with the long-boat at the moment of the wreck. \\n\\n \\n\\n When Louis Cornbutte, shut in among the ice, realized what must happen, he took every precaution for passing the winter. He was an energetic man, very active and courageous; but, despite his firmness, he had been subdued by this horrible climate, and when his father found him he had given up all hope of life. He had not only had to contend with the elements, but with the ugly temper of the two Norwegian sailors, who owed him their existence. They were like savages, almost inaccessible to the most natural emotions. When Louis had the opportunity to talk to Penellan, he advised him to watch them carefully. In return, Penellan told him of André Vasling’s conduct. Louis could not believe it, but Penellan convinced him that after his disappearance Vasling had always acted so as to secure Marie’s hand. \\n\\n \\n\\n The whole day was employed in rest and the pleasures of reunion. Misonne and Pierre Nouquet killed some sea-birds near the hut, whence it was not prudent to stray far. These fresh provisions and the replenished fire raised the spirits of the weakest. Louis Cornbutte got visibly better. It was the first moment of happiness these brave people had experienced. They celebrated it with enthusiasm in this wretched hut, six hundred leagues from the North Sea, in a temperature of thirty degrees below zero! \\n\\n \\n\\n This temperature lasted till the end of the moon, and it was not until about the 17th of November, a week after their meeting, that Jean Cornbutte and his party could think of setting out. They only had the light of the stars to guide them; but the cold was less extreme, and even some snow fell. \\n\\n \\n\\n Before quitting this place a grave was dug for poor Courtois. It was a sad ceremony, which deeply affected his comrades. He was the first of them who would not again see his native land. \\n\\n \\n\\n Misonne had constructed, with the planks of the cabin, a sort of sledge for carrying the provisions, and the sailors drew it by turns. Jean Cornbutte led the expedition by the ways already traversed. Camps were established with great promptness when the times for repose came. Jean Cornbutte hoped to find his deposits of provisions again, as they had become well-nigh indispensable by the addition of four persons to the party. He was therefore very careful not to diverge from the route by which he had come. \\n\\n \\n\\n By good fortune he recovered his sledge, which had stranded near the promontory where they had all run so many dangers. The dogs, after eating their straps to satisfy their hunger, had attacked the provisions in the sledge. These had sustained them, and they served to guide the party to the sledge, where there was a considerable quantity of provisions left. The little band resumed its march towards the bay. The dogs were harnessed to the sleigh, and no event of interest attended the return. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was observed that Aupic, André Vasling, and the Norwegians kept aloof, and did not mingle with the others; but, unbeknown to themselves, they were narrowly watched. This germ of dissension more than once aroused the fears of Louis Cornbutte and Penellan. \\n\\n \\n\\n About the 7th of December, twenty days after the discovery of the castaways, they perceived the bay where the “Jeune–Hardie” was lying. What was their astonishment to see the brig perched four yards in the air on blocks of ice! They hurried forward, much alarmed for their companions, and were received with joyous cries by Gervique, Turquiette, and Gradlin. All of them were in good health, though they too had been subjected to formidable dangers. \\n\\n \\n\\n The tempest had made itself felt throughout the polar sea. The ice had been broken and displaced, crushed one piece against another, and had seized the bed on which the ship rested. Though its specific weight tended to carry it under water, the ice had acquired an incalculable force, and the brig had been suddenly raised up out of the sea. \\n\\n \\n\\n The first moments were given up to the happiness inspired by the safe return. The exploring party were rejoiced to find everything in good condition, which assured them a supportable though it might be a rough winter. The ship had not been shaken by her sudden elevation, and was perfectly tight. When the season of thawing came, they would only have to slide her down an inclined plane, to launch her, in a word, in the once more open sea. \\n\\n \\n\\n But a bad piece of news spread gloom on the faces of Jean Cornbutte and his comrades. During the terrible gale the snow storehouse on the coast had been quite demolished; the provisions which it contained were scattered, and it had not been possible to save a morsel of them. When Jean and Louis Cornbutte learnt this, they visited the hold and steward’s room, to ascertain the quantity of provisions which still remained. \\n\\n \\n\\n The thaw would not come until May, and the brig could not leave the bay before that period. They had therefore five winter months before them to pass amid the ice, during which fourteen persons were to be fed. Having made his calculations, Jean Cornbutte found that he would at most be able to keep them alive till the time for departure, by putting each and all on half rations. Hunting for game became compulsory to procure food in larger quantity. \\n\\n \\n\\n For fear that they might again run short of provisions, it was decided to deposit them no longer in the ground. All of them were kept on board, and beds were disposed for the new comers in the common lodging. Turquiette, Gervique, and Gradlin, during the absence of the others, had hollowed out a flight of steps in the ice, which enabled them easily to reach the ship’s deck. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1475/44234.html","bookId":1357,"book":{"id":1357,"title":"A Winter Amid the Ice","description":"简介： The cur of the ancient church of Dunkirk rose at five oclock on the 12th of May, 18to perform, according to his custom, low mass for the benefit of a few pious sinners....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1475","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:54 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:54 AM"}}
