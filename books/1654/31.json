{"id":100407,"no":31,"title":"Page 31","content":"“I didn’t think it was possible for those monsters to learn,” she said, almost to herself.\\n\\n I spoke for the first time. “They’re definitely changing.”\\n\\n It wasn’t clear to me what our role was in Soldier’s Pond. We didn’t report to her, but it seemed polite to offer what knowledge we’d gathered in exchange for supplies and shelter. So I picked up where Morrow’s tale left off, and I filled in details, mostly related to altered Freak behavior, but also about towns we’d visited and the deal the Freaks had offered Otterburn.\\n\\n Her normally detached expression faltered, revealing a trace of pure horror. She mastered it swiftly, but not before I saw the truth. The colonel averted her eyes, directing them to her maps. With a pencil she outlined the territory we had secured.\\n\\n “So this is promised to be Mutie-free?”\\n\\n I nodded. “We weren’t fighting the horde, just hunting parties, but it should help. If the larger group decides to attack, however, the truce means nothing.”\\n\\n “It’s more than I thought you’d achieve when you set out,” she admitted.\\n\\n “Just think what we could do if your men weren’t all such cowards,” Stalker said flatly.\\n\\n Things went downhill from there. Shortly afterward, I left HQ, longing for a bath and to see my family, definitely in that order. I shrugged deeper into the coat Edmund had made for me—it was soft leather lined in fleece shorn from the sheep they kept in the animal pens. That part of town was noisy and smelly, unavoidable when space was limited. In Soldier’s Pond they addressed that by making people sleep in narrow cots stacked one atop another; there was little focus on private space like there had been in Salvation. In some ways, this town was more like down below with its focus on duty to the collective, the dearth of amenities, and savorless food. On the plus side, they didn’t seem to mind who did the killing or wore pants. From what I could see, everybody here worked as a Hunter. They just had to turn their hands to other jobs too. That probably explained why the clothes were poorly sewn and the food was terrible. Anyone with a grain of sense knew you needed Builders like Edmund too.\\n\\n “I’ll meet you in the mess for dinner,” I said to Fade, who kissed the top of my head.\\n\\n I lifted a hand in farewell and hurried to the bathhouse, empty at this time of day. The scarcity of the sun meant the water was only a little better than ice cold; I bore it, though the soft soap didn’t lather much and it took me twice as long to scrape the wilderness out of my hair. After, I dug out the clean traveling clothes I kept aside for special occasions. As I tugged on the dun brown trousers with a tie at the waist, I knew a moment’s regret for the loss of the dresses I hadn’t even wanted at first. But by the time I had my shirt on, my lovely, polished boots, and the lined jacket, I didn’t care so much. It was better to be warm than pretty.\\n\\n My hair went into neat plaits, and I hoped they didn’t freeze as I stepped out into the biting air. The snow had followed us from the forest, white stars now slanting downward from a gray sky. I ran all the way to the house where I’d find my parents waiting; it was late enough that Edmund might even be done at the workshop. To my delight, I found all of them there, just gathering for dinner.\\n\\n “Deuce!” Momma Oaks had her arms around me before I was halfway in the door.\\n\\n “I don’t think I ever said it, but I love you all … very much.”\\n\\n Edmund and Rex both grabbed me close until I was squashed on all sides. It was pretty close to the best I ever felt. I tried to hug my whole family at the same time but my arms weren’t long enough. My mother kissed me all over my cold cheeks. Her eyes were sparkling when she stepped back to look at me.\\n\\n “Well, you’re not bleeding, so I take it your mission was a success?”\\n\\n “In a manner of speaking. I’ll tell you all about it over dinner.”\\n\\n “Are you home for a while?” Edmund asked.\\n\\n They got their own coats and stepped out. My father stared up anxiously at the sky, and I could tell without him saying it that he was worried about us traveling in this weather. “I think so. There isn’t a whole lot we can do during the snowy months.”\\n\\n Momma Oaks nodded in satisfaction. “It’s odd here, but we’re pulling our weight, and the men seem to like Edmund’s work awfully well.”\\n\\n “I imagine.” I’d seen what they wore before; Edmund’s shoes were magical by comparison.\\n\\n “They’ve got us making leather grips for weapons,” Rex put in.\\n\\n “I suspect they’ll make a permanent exception for you,” I said. “If you want to stay.”\\n\\n “Where would we go?” Momma Oaks asked.\\n\\n It was an excellent question. So far, in my travels, I hadn’t found a place I thought would suit them better. Considering all the soldiers, the metal defenses, and cache of weapons, plus the extra breathing room I’d won from the Freaks, I couldn’t fathom a safer place. Whether they were happy and comfortable, if they actually felt at home, those were questions I didn’t dare ask.\\n\\n To my astonishment, when I strode into the mess hall, applause broke out. Some of the men rose to their feet and saluted me, just like they did the colonel or some other important person who ran around barking orders. I glanced over my shoulder in reflex, thinking they must mean somebody else, and Edmund nudged me.\\n\\n “You have to acknowledge them somehow, so they can go back to their meals.”\\n\\n This was all completely new to me, so I racked my brain for what would serve, then I touched my brow with two fingers as Longshot had when he was being respectful of some good idea. The soldiers loved it; some stomped their feet, and others banged cutlery on the table until the cook yelled at them to pipe down.\\n\\n “My goodness,” Momma Oaks said. “What in the world did you do out there?”\\n\\n “Let’s get our food, then I’ll tell you.”\\n\\n The story was half over, though not as exciting as Morrow made it sound, when Fade arrived. Since the rest of us had barely touched our meals, he had plenty of time to catch up. Rex and Edmund offered their hands to shake and Momma Oaks contented herself with a warm smile, though she wanted to squeeze him. But she was an observant woman, and she’d doubtless noticed the way he pulled his body in when surrounded by people.\\n\\n “You missed the hero’s welcome,” I teased.\\n\\n Fade shrugged. “That was for you anyway.”\\n\\n “We all earned it.”\\n\\n “I’m just so proud of you,” Momma Oaks said.\\n\\n Once, that kind of remark would’ve puzzled me. She’d had nothing to do with my training, so why would she feel anything about my accomplishments? But now I knew that love made her care about all things related to me—and I felt the same way. I would never tell them, because it would worry them more, but I might be more interested in waiting out the time until I was old enough to enlist, and then just quietly joining the soldiers here, if it wasn’t for them. But I wanted them to be happy; I wanted to give them a home as snug and safe as the one they’d freely offered me. Accomplishing that required more than mere patience.\\n\\n My family asked us questions others didn’t think to pose, like what kind of shoes and clothes they wore in other towns. Did I think they could master the patterns? Dinner passed in an agreeable fashion, and as we left, Fade whispered, “I could really use some time alone with you.”\\n\\n There was no privacy in the bunks where we all slept, and I didn’t know of any conveniently empty houses here. I must’ve looked conflicted because he added, low, “Just meet me out back after everyone’s asleep.”\\n\\n Then Edmund dragged him off to see some improvements he’d made to the workshop and Rex went along. That left me to walk back to the house with Momma Oaks. She put an arm around my shoulders, which took some doing as I was a little taller than she was. I hunched a little to make it easier, and she gave me that glowing look, the one that said all kinds of happy things, like, I love you and I’m proud and I’m thrilled you’re here. Before I met the Oakses, nobody much cared about my comings-and-goings, so long as I followed orders.\\n\\n “I’ve been wondering about something,” I said, as we stepped into the house.\\n\\n This time, I got a better look at the place, and I saw she’d made it homier. The beds had been moved to a less rigid arrangement, and she’d found some chairs—or maybe Rex or Edmund had built them. There were other small touches as well: wall hangings that I was sure she’d made from scraps of cloth, most of which were green. It seemed to be the only color this settlement knew how to produce.\\n\\n “What’s that?”\\n\\n “Some people have two names, like you and John Kelley, the trapper we met. Why?”\\n\\n “The first is the name my parents gave me, the last a family one.” She fixed a stern look on me. “And you do have a second name, missy. You’re Deuce Oaks. We claimed you as ours, and I’ll tell Edmund if I hear any nonsense about you rejecting our surname.”\\n\\n I was astonished. “Nobody told me that joining a family meant taking their name.”\\n\\n “I suppose not.” Her gaze softened.\\n\\n “But what about Fade? Is he a Jensen now?” I curled one hand into a fist, ready to fight at the idea that he had to carry a permanent reminder of the man who’d hurt him.\\n\\n She shook her head. “He’s one of ours too.”\\n\\n “So we’re both Oakses?” I asked.\\n\\n “To my mind, you are. I love that boy like a son.”\\n\\n “But if I’m your daughter and he’s your son—”\\n\\n She cut me off with a harried wave of one hand. “Don’t make things complicated, Deuce. There’s no blood relation.”\\n\\n That wasn’t even what I was about to say. I knew I wasn’t related to Fade on the bloodline tree, so that we could breed, should I want that down the line. “No, you told me once that when people join up and make their promises, they take the same name. Does that mean Fade and I already did that?” I was a little confused by this point.\\n\\n She sighed. “No. But you’re all set for when you do.”\\n\\n I liked how she had no doubt that we belonged together—like the day boy and the night girl, we’d end up together forever. That was good enough for me … but much as I was enjoying this reunion, I couldn’t wait until my family fell asleep.\\n\\n Interlude\\n\\n The moon was a silver crescent brightening the gauzy veil of the midnight sky. With the snow still coming down in lazy flutters, I saw the cold in the smoky whorls of my breath. I gazed up as I followed Fade silently. My feet crunched on the layer of snow, untouched apart from the watchmen who patrolled the town at night. There wasn’t a curfew, but if they caught us wandering at this hour, there would be questions. I didn’t imagine they would look kindly on “we missed sparking” as an answer.\\n\\n Fade’s hand was warm when he wrapped it around mine. He tugged. “Come on.”\\n\\n “Where are we going?” I asked.\\n\\n He shushed me with such obvious delight that I didn’t have the heart to ask again. He wanted to surprise me, so I let him. Our destination was a medium-size building with smoke wafting up. That meant there was a fire lit inside, and considering how cold it had become and how much snow had accumulated during the day, I was glad to see it. After jiggling the door just so, he popped it open. Within lay some kind of meeting place, but more comfortable than HQ. Instead of tables there were padded chairs and sofas scattered throughout. Shelving contained a few old books, most in worse condition than The Day Boy and the Night Girl. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/horde-razorland-3/page-31.html","bookId":1654,"book":{"id":1654,"title":"Horde (Razorland #3)","description":"Storyline: Horde (Razorland #3) \\n The horde is coming. \\n Salvation is surrounded, monsters at the gates, and this time, they\u0027re not going away.
