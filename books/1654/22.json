It’s only advice for next time.”\\n\\n “Then what do you want?”\\n\\n “There will be no gentle words between us. No more of me begging for a scrap of your affection.”\\n\\n “I never asked you to,” I protested.\\n\\n “Fair enough. This is what I propose—and you should be aware I have another offer on the table. You give me command of the scouts and accept that I’m not answerable to you. I lead my own men. I’ll fight with your group, but we’re free to come and go, pick our own battles.”\\n\\n “If I don’t agree?”\\n\\n “Then I’m staying in Soldier’s Pond. I don’t expect you care. But they appreciate my skills. I won’t be in charge of the scouts, but I can work my way up. And it’ll get me away from you.” He said it like distance was a necessary cure for a disease against which he’d been fighting a losing battle.\\n\\n “Maybe it will be better if you do stay here. I don’t want to hurt you, Stalker. I never wanted that. Except when you first took us. Then I intended to kill you.”\\n\\n A reluctant laugh escaped him. “And I intended for you to lead the Wolves alongside me. I figured you’d see the advantages soon enough.”\\n\\n “No,” I said gently. “I’d have died fighting you. I don’t have it in me to bend. For me, it’s always been Fade. It always will be.”\\n\\n He nodded, his eyes cold. “I understand that. And I can live with it. Do we have a deal?”\\n\\n Part of me didn’t think it was a good idea to take him along, but he was an excellent scout. Only the fact that he wanted to lead his own men had driven him to offer this agreement. He had been in power in the Wolves, and he didn’t much like following orders, which he’d have to do if he stayed in Soldier’s Pond and formally joined their ranks. While the scouts might have more freedom, there was still a chain of command, and Stalker wanted to be at the top.\\n\\n “Right now, there’s nobody for you to lead, but I accept.”\\n\\n He nodded. “That’s enough. I’ve seen what you can accomplish.”\\n\\n That sounded an awful lot like a vote of confidence. Before I could thank him for it, he turned and strode away. In time, I hoped he would get over his hurt feelings. I missed training with him. Fade stepped out of the house when I approached the door.\\n\\n “What was that about?” But his tone wasn’t sharp or fearful; and that, too, was a relief. I didn’t need to deal with jealousy on top of everything else.\\n\\n Quickly I summarized the offer Stalker had made.\\n\\n “He’ll do well with that, provided we can find him some scouts.”\\n\\n I sighed. “That’s far from sure, at this point.”\\n\\n “At least you’re taking action. Every big thing starts small.”\\n\\n Maybe I was just tired, but that seemed profound. Fade took a breath, then framed my face in his hands, contact initiated wholly by him. I gazed up at him, enjoying the warmth of his palms against my cheeks. Then he brushed a kiss against my brow, amusement in his dark eyes.\\n\\n “Tegan got you good.”\\n\\n “She did.” I ducked my head. “But I had it coming.”\\n\\n He kissed my temple next, and I closed my eyes with a shiver of pleasure. “Thanks, Deuce.”\\n\\n “What for?”\\n\\n “Being patient. I don’t know why, but it’s better and easier when I’m in control. When you just let me—I don’t know.” Fade’s hand curled into a fist because he was obviously frustrated at not being able to explain. “It’s just better.”\\n\\n “That’s all I care about. If it means I have to wait for you to hold my hand or to kiss me, that’s fine. I fully believe there will come a time when you don’t even think about it anymore.”\\n\\n “It might be a while,” he warned me.\\n\\n I smiled. “Then I’ll just have to depend on your urge to touch me.”\\n\\n “You can count on that.” His dark eyes held a hungry light, like he wanted to eat me up. I rather wanted to let him.\\n\\n That night, we all slept in the same room, the small barrack house my folks had been assigned. Edmund snored a little; so did Rex. At some point, Fade climbed down from his bunk and into mine. Since he was warm, I didn’t protest … and since he wanted to be close to me, I took it as a personal victory. His arms went around me, so natural that I drifted back to sleep at once. When I woke, he was gone, probably down at the workshop with the other two men.\\n\\n Momma Oaks was listlessly sweeping the floor, which didn’t need it, when I rolled out of my bed and bundled up some clean clothes, intending to head to the washhouse. Impulsively, I went over and hugged her. She squeezed me back, patting my shoulders as if I were the one who needed comfort. And maybe I did. Yesterday sure hadn’t gone as I’d hoped.\\n\\n “I’ll find us a better place,” I promised her. “Just hold on, and when the war’s over, I’ll look for a town that will suit us all better.”\\n\\n She smiled. “It’d be impossible to have a better daughter or for me to love you more.”\\n\\n Stepping back, I took her hands in mine, feeling so many things that I just didn’t even have the words for them. “I’m sorry about Salvation. I wish I could’ve done more, if I had stopped that Freak who stole the fire—”\\n\\n “Oh, honey, no. Put that burden down. It’s not yours to carry. The Lord sends trials as he sees fit. In my heart, I thought you could try harder to fit in Salvation. I love you but I didn’t always understand. Perhaps this is His way of making me see.”\\n\\n “You think he took away your home in order to teach you something?” That sounded like a mean, petty thing to do for someone who supposedly had all the power.\\n\\n “Could be. But speculating is pointless. His ways are beyond our understanding.”\\n\\n Nodding, I stepped back and collected my things. I would have to rush to get cleaned up and make the breakfast service in the mess hall. I ran to the bathhouse, past the center of town, where a number of houses had been demolished, and that was where they planted their crops. In addition, there were gardens just inside the metal fencing. Soldier’s Pond made excellent use of the space they defended. It was efficient, certainly. There was also a pen full of livestock, but they used the meat sparingly from what I’d seen. I hurried through my shower and arrived as the last latecomers joined the line. I didn’t like this part of our new life; I preferred Salvation’s way of eating meals at home. Cooked in such quantities, the food was bland and savorless.\\n\\n You won’t be eating it much longer.\\n\\n Skimming the crowd, I saw no one I knew until Morrow beckoned me over. He was sitting alone with a sheaf of papers, his fingers ink-stained. As I approached, he nudged them aside, making room for my plate. I sat down on the bench opposite him.\\n\\n “You weren’t kidding,” I said, surprised.\\n\\n “When people stop writing down their stories, the soul of the world is lost.”\\n\\n “So what was it like, growing up here? Did you have a choice about becoming a soldier?” I wasn’t clear how that worked.\\n\\n “I’m not from here, and I’m not one, really. I come and go like the wind.” Though his tone was light, he definitely meant it.\\n\\n “But the colonel sent you with us to Salvation, among her best men.”\\n\\n “You saw my work with the foil. Would you not agree that I have skill?” I couldn’t argue that. He went on, “And she didn’t send me. I chose to go. Big difference.”\\n\\n I raised a brow. “Because you thought it would make a good story?”\\n\\n Morrow indicated the scattered papers. “What do you think I’m writing?”\\n\\n I didn’t know how I felt about that. On some level it seemed disrespectful to make an entertainment out of what the folks of Salvation had suffered. But another part of me said it was good and fitting that they would be remembered. Mulling the two conflicting thoughts, I downed the rest of my food without much enjoyment.\\n\\n “Thanks for the company,” I said, rising. “I’ll be in touch in a few days, once I see how many men are coming from Winterville.”\\n\\n “Not many, I expect. It’s why Dr. Wilson was working on a peaceful solution to the Mutie problem.”\\n\\n I wondered how he knew about the pheromones or if he knew anything at all. Morrow might be testing me to see what he could learn for his blasted stories. While I needed his blade, I didn’t fully trust him or his motives; he had his own reasons for joining me. Still, it was better to have men who could think for themselves instead of those who followed blindly.\\n\\n Three days later, four men arrived from Winterville. They were exhausted and two of them were wounded from a skirmish with the Freaks. Tegan treated their wounds, which weren’t serious. They were all angry when they realized the message hadn’t come from the colonel, but they’d all lost their families to the madness Dr. Wilson created when he sprayed the town. So they had nothing to go home for and a strong reason to fight.\\n\\n The next day, as we assembled in the training yard, I did a head count. Four from Soldier’s Pond. Four men from Winterville. When Tegan presented herself without a word, angry eyes daring me to protest, that gave us four from the ruins of Gotham. That made twelve—such a small number to set out toward such a big goal. My family came out to watch us go. There was no fanfare; the soldiers never paused in their work or their drills. They probably figured we were going to die.\\n\\n It was up to us to prove them wrong.\\n\\n Otterburn\\n\\n I had never been in charge of anything before.\\n\\n So when Stalker stepped in and interrogated all the new men from Winterville, then claimed two of them for the scouts, I let it happen, partly because we needed skilled sentries, and partly because I felt guilty that I didn’t care about him the way he wanted. That was an illogical reaction and I had to banish it. But it would help the rest of the squad, small as it was, to have good intel. The scouts would still fight when it came down to it. Before we left, I had checked the maps and memorized the route to Otterburn. It wasn’t far from Soldier’s Pond, only a day up the river via hard march. Wagons would take much longer. I didn’t anticipate trouble, but it was best to be prepared.\\n\\n “Stalker, would you mind—”\\n\\n “We’ll scout,” he said.\\n\\n His team hurried off to check the path ahead. I understood why he didn’t let me finish. He was making it clear this mission resulted from his choice, not because I asked.\\n\\n I turned to the rest. “Let’s go. We’ll make Otterburn by nightfall if we push.”\\n\\n Tegan fell into step, looking sheepish. “I’m sorry I hit you.”\\n\\n “You were mad. I understand why.”\\n\\n “I figured you’d stop me.”\\n\\n “I scared you and hurt your feelings. That deserved a smack in the face.” I smiled at her, wincing a little at the way it pulled my sore nose. “I’m just glad you came with us anyway. We’ll need a medic something fierce before this is through.” \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/horde-razorland-3/page-22.html","bookId":1654,"book":{"id":1654,"title":"Horde (Razorland #3)","description":"Storyline: Horde (Razorland #3) \\n The horde is coming. \\n Salvation is surrounded, monsters at the gates, and this time, they\u0027re not going away.
