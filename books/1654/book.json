{"id":1654,"title":"Horde (Razorland #3)","description":"Storyline: Horde (Razorland #3) The horde is coming. Salvation is surrounded, monsters at the gates, and this time, they\u0027re not going away. When Deuce, Fade, Stalker and Tegan set out, the odds are against them. But the odds have been stacked against Deuce from the moment she was born. She might not be a Huntress anymore, but she doesn\u0027t run. With her knives in hand and her companions at her side, she will not falter, whether fighting for her life or Fade\u0027s love. Ahead, the battle of a lifetime awaits. Freaks are everywhere, attacking settlements, setting up scouts, perimeters, and patrols. There hasn\u0027t been a war like this in centuries, and humans have forgotten how to stand and fight. Unless Deuce can lead them. This time, however, more than the fate of a single enclave or outpost hangs in the balance. This time, Deuce carries the banner for the survival of all humanity.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/horde-razorland-3.jpg","author":"Ann Aguirre","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":61,"category":{"id":7,"name":"Science Fiction","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
