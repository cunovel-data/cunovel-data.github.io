{"id":32292,"no":19,"title":"CHAPTER XIX.","content":"Would day-light never come was a speculation that lay upon my mind until it seemed to gather mold, like a rag in a damp cellar. But why should I long for the sun to rise to pour light upon the blood in the lane? And to myself I said that it would be better for me if darkness should remain forever upon the earth. But the hours were so tiresome and the world was so reproachfully still. I had thought that my reading had led me away from the superstitions of my negro ancestors; long ago I had thrown away the lucky bone taken from the head of a cat-fish; I had ceased to make a cross mark in the road and spit in it whenever I found that I had forgotten something and was forced to turn back; I did not believe that the hanging of a dead snake across the fence, belly up, would make it rain; I had laughed at old Steve when he told me that a horse\u0027s tooth, ground to powder and carried sewed up in a sack, would prevail against the tricks of the conjurer. But now I believed in it all and trembled at the awful consequences that a renegade scorn might[Pg 184] call upon me. With a cold sweat I remembered the words of a black hag who lived in a hovel at the edge of the town. On an occasion, not more than a month gone-by, she had taken offense at what she termed my uppishness; she crossed her crutches in front of me, cut a mysterious diagram in the air and swore that before the moon changed twice I should fall a victim to a blighting calamity. The moon had not changed twice and the calamity had fallen. I got up to look at the moon, to search for a confirming mark upon it, but through the windless night, dark clouds had floated and the sky was black. At the window I sat and gazed into the darkness toward the lane. A wind sprang up and was hoarse in the tree-tops. Rain would come and wash the blood away, but the body and the crying wound would be there at the coming of day. I wondered whither my Young Master could have gone and why he should have left me. Was it that he had gone thus early to the authorities to beg for my life? That were useless. Law and society must have my blood. On my side a ton of justice would be but a thistledown, blown by a baby\u0027s breath. And I gazed from the window toward the lane. Day-light could not be far away; it had already fallen upon the hilltops, I thought. Yes, the far-off sky was turning gray;[Pg 185] but nearer it was black with clouds. Strange that a storm should be gathering just at this time. The lighter it grew the nearer the clouds came. They split, one in the form of a great bird, sailing away; the other was a horse galloping madly, with a ribbon, a bridle-rein of lightning, flashing at its throat. The household was stirring. I heard Old Master go down the stairs; I heard old Steve calling the hogs. There was not to be a storm. The clouds were gone and the air was sultry. The horn was blown to call the negroes to breakfast. I heard horses galloping over the turn-pike. But the body in the lane had not been found. God, I could see it, lying near the fence! I heard someone coming and I crept back to bed and covered myself. Mr. Clem entered the room. \"You boys going to sleep all day?\" he asked. \"But Bob\u0027s gone; where is he? Why, he hasn\u0027t been to bed. Didn\u0027t he stay here last night?\" \"No, sir; he went away early on business.\" \"But what\u0027s the matter with you this morning? You look sick.\" \"I am, sir. I don\u0027t believe I am able to get up.\" \"I\u0027d better send for a doctor. Why, you\u0027ve got a chill.\" [Pg 186] \"Don\u0027t send for a doctor,\" I pleaded. \"Don\u0027t send for anyone; let me lie here alone.\" \"Well, I\u0027m sorry you\u0027re sick,\" he said, turning about. \"Want anything to eat?\" \"No, sir. I just want to lie here until Young Master comes.\" For a time he stood looking hard at me, with his hand on the door. \"Hear of the row last night?\" he asked. I feigned surprise and said that I had not, whereupon he continued: \"The Old General finally summoned the requisite nerve and drove the doctor off. I wasn\u0027t very close, but I heard all that passed. The doctor pleaded and started to threaten and then the old man roared. \u0027If you are anywhere in this neighborhood by morning,\u0027 said he, \u0027I will take a shot gun to you, I don\u0027t care what the public says or how close its investigation may be.\u0027 The doctor moved on off and I followed along, to see what he intended to do when the old man\u0027s back was turned, and once I got close enough to hear his mutterings and to understand him to say, \u0027I\u0027ll let the old fool go, but somebody will die before morning.\u0027 Just then the General called me and I went back. I don\u0027t know who the doctor intended to kill, didn\u0027t know but it might be Bob, and[Pg 187] I would have come in last night to tell him—saw him going up the stairs—but Bill Mason came over and said that he wanted to beat me out of a horse or two, and so I went over to his place and haggled with him nearly all night. Man of considerable worth, Mason is. Has kept his eyes pretty well open while other people have been dreaming, but he napped a trifle and I came off some time before day with two better horses than I took with me and a pretty fair roll of money. I told Bob, you remember, that I never would say anything more to you about running away, and I won\u0027t. But somehow I think that justice ought to be stronger than friendship or even blood relationship. Still, I\u0027ll keep my word with him and not advise you to run away. I tell you what I\u0027m going to do, though. I\u0027m going to throw this roll of money over there on the bed, and if it\u0027s not there when I come back, and if you are gone by to-night—but I promised Bob.\" He threw a roll of bank notes on the bed and almost trotted in his haste to get down the stairs. I got up and walked about the room, not daring to look at the money, but my mind was not so obedient as my eyes. The means of possible escape lay there within my reach. Could any human being blame me for struggling to save my life? I went to the window and[Pg 188] looked out and drew back with a shudder. The body had been found. Several persons were standing about it, and along the lane there walked a number of men, my young master in the midst of them and among them I recognized the coroner of the county. They were going to hold the inquest. I saw Old Master and Mr. Clem walking hard to overtake them. Now was my time. I jumped into my clothes, wondering that no one had called me to see the dead man; I clapped my hat upon my head—and seized the money. I ran to the door, but to save my life I could not cross the threshold. I stood there gasping, with that old woman\u0027s crutches crossed before me. I threw the money upon the bed and my love for my master arose strong and overpowering in my heart, and with the tears streaming from my eyes I bounded down the stairs, out into the yard, over the fence, and tore down the lane toward the spot where the body lay under the stern eye of the law. I caught up with Old Master and Mr. Clem just as they reached the place—I ran to Young Master, and he turned upon me with a frown. \"Don\u0027t interrupt me,\" he cried, waving his hand. \"I know your devotion to me, but I demand silence. Gentlemen,\" he said, addressing the coroner and the jury, \"I don\u0027t intend to make myself out altogether[Pg 189] blameless, but I was forced to kill him. I was unarmed and it was his own knife that shed his blood.\" And then, while I stood there gaping, he gave in minutest detail an account of the strike, the struggle and the fall. I looked at Old Master as he stood there bent forward, staring; at Mr. Clem as he gazed upon the young man who had stepped in between me and the hangman, but my jaws were locked wide open and I could not speak. \"Gentlemen,\" said Mr. Clem, \"I demand to be sworn.\" He held up his hand, muttered the oath and then proceeded with his testimony. \"Last night I heard the doctor say he would kill him. He said that he would let the old man go, meaning my brother, but that someone would die before day, and I know that he meant Bob. It has been well known among us that bad blood existed between them. I—\" Suddenly I leaped forward, struck upon the head, I fancied, by the crutches of the old woman, and with a cry I fell upon my knees. \"My master did not kill him;\" I groaned in agony. \"I killed him. Listen to me and then you may hang me. I—\" Bob sprang at me and clapped his hand over my mouth. \"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"this poor, devoted boy[Pg 190] would save my life—it\u0027s his way of repaying a life-long kindness. Pay no attention to him, but let us attend to the demands of justice. I killed this man, I have told you why and how. And I am ready to take the consequences. Come here, Dan.\" He jerked me to my feet and led me off. \"Dispute me another time,\" he said, \"and before God I will cut your throat. Now go to the house or I\u0027ll take a stick and beat you every step of the way.\" I was almost bereft of my senses as I walked toward the house. I met Old Miss with a troop of negroes behind her. She was wringing her hands and the negroes were crooning a low chant. Some one bade me stop, but I hastened on, through the yard, up to the room; and the sight of the money lying there on the bed, the thought that I had clutched it to run away from the noblest man that ever breathed, drove me mad; and I fell upon the lounge and the world was black. When I opened my eyes to the light, I was undressed between the sheets and a cloth was bound about my head. Someone was talking. I looked up and saw a physician just taking his leave. Bob stood at the window. I raised myself up and he hastened to me. \"Don\u0027t get up, Dan,\" he said. [Pg 191] \"Yes, I am all right now.\" But I was not all right. I was so weak that I could scarcely sit up in bed. \"What time is it?\" I asked. \"Oh, about ten,\" he answered, smiling. \"And I\u0027m devilish glad to see that you\u0027ve come out all right. We thought at one time that you were gone. You raved all day yesterday.\" \"Yesterday! No, we were deep in our books yesterday.\" \"Dan, you have been in bed a week.\" \"Is it possible?\" I cried, and then I looked at him. He read the inquiry that was in my mind. \"The coroner\u0027s jury discharged me,\" he said. \"And not a vestige of blame clings to me. The neighbors all have come to give me their hands. Now if you are going to cry like a fool, I won\u0027t tell you about it. There, I didn\u0027t mean to be harsh. It\u0027s all right. They said that I couldn\u0027t have done otherwise, and no regret is expressed. Why, it has made quite a hero out of you. Fame whirls her cloak in the air and we never know how soon it is going to fall. Don\u0027t look at me that way. Oh, yes, you may take my hand if you want to. There, now, don\u0027t blubber. Why, don\u0027t you know they would have hanged you long before this time? But we won\u0027t talk about that. We didn\u0027t bury[Pg 192] him in the garden,\" he went on after a slight pause, \"but in the grave-yard on the other side of town. We agreed, mother with the rest of us, that he must not lie beside my sister. It may seem strange to you, but the household appears happier. Father\u0027s mind has thrown off a load. And Uncle Clem has been so stimulated that he has filled the stable with horses. He\u0027s preparing to drive them to market. Don\u0027t be in a hurry about getting up. Just take your time. And I\u0027ll go down and have them send you something to eat.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3303/90317.html","bookId":423,"book":{"id":423,"title":"My Young Master","description":"简介： This is the story of a master, told by his slave.
