{"id":32281,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER VIII.","content":"How hallowed and sun-glinted that school life now seems to me. Many a grave has been opened and closed, the roots of many a greenbriar is embedded in the ashes of a heart that was once alive with fire, the fierce passion of life. The sun is still shining, and the arch of God\u0027s many-hued lithograph is still seen in the sky, and hearts have fire shut within them, but I wonder if the sun is as bright as it was in the long ago, if the rain-bow is as purple, if the fire in the heart is as glowing. Ah, and I know that my grand-children, in the far-away years to come, will lean feebly upon the gate and wonder if the world is as full of light as it was. Every emotion you have felt you may know has been felt by other men. It is this that makes nearly all poetry seem old; it is this that sends true poetry to the human heart. I will not linger over those days at school. I have sought thus far to picture my early life, not that it held incident, but that it revealed a condition. Time has been so sweeping, the hot blast that blew from the North[Pg 60] was so scorching, and left such dried and brittle stems where green memories grew, that the youth of to-day can scarcely bring himself to comprehend that strange democratic absolutism which once existed in the South. And I wonder now that it could have lasted so long, though for years the wonder was that it could so soon have been broken up. How odd now it would seem to point out a man and say, \"He once owned, in this land of freedom, a hundred human beings—owned them in body, but Christian-like yielded to God the direction of their souls.\" During the regular sessions, until he had reached his eighteenth year, my young master attended the Layfield Academy, and then he was entered at Center College. I had kept well up with him, a dead secret between us, for Old Mistress had more than once made him promise that I should be kept down upon the servants\u0027 proper level. But the secret was discovered and once it was held threateningly over me. Bob and I were home to spend the Christmas holidays. On the plantation was an Ethiopian Lothario, named Steve, and one evening in his cabin he asked me if I would write for him a letter to a mulatto girl who lived on a distant farm. \"I want you,\" said he, \"ter fling in jest ez much sweet pizen ez you kin, caze[Pg 61] I lubs dat lady an\u0027 her head is monstus high. I yered de white preacher say sumfin dat he \u0027lowed wuz frum de dead language. An\u0027 kain\u0027t you lash in er little o\u0027 dat dead talk? I know it\u0027ll fetch her caze dat preacher\u0027s dead talk fotch me.\" \"How do you know I can write?\" I asked, for I had curbed the pedantic instinct of the negro blood within me and except to a few trusted friends had dropped no hint that I could even read. \"Oh, I \u0027lowed dat ez smart er boy ez you gwine off ter school an\u0027 college wid his young marster oughter larn how ter do dat. Will you write de letter fur me?\" I wrote him a screed that made his eyes snap when I read it to him. It was a mixture of cold Latin grammar and warm persuasion. \"Ah, Lawd,\" he said as he sat, tallowing his Sunday shoes, \"ef dat doan fetch her she ain\u0027t ter be fotch.\" He folded the letter, and when he had put it into his pocket he turned upon me. \"Oh, yas, you goes off ter school an\u0027 l\u0027arns dead talk an\u0027 de rest o\u0027 us hatter sweat in de fiel\u0027. An\u0027 de fust thing we knows you\u0027ll be crossin\u0027 de Ohio riber ter make speeches \u0027mong dem \u0027litionists. I\u0027m gwine tell Ole Miss.\" \"What!\" I cried, \"after I have written a letter for you?\" [Pg 62] \"Oh, I kain\u0027t hep de letter. Dat wuz er—wuz er matter o\u0027 fack. But it ain\u0027t er matter o\u0027 fack dat you\u0027se been trying ter put yo-se\u0027f up \u0027mong de white fo\u0027ks, er turnin\u0027 up yo\u0027 nose at us caze you\u0027se whiter an\u0027 got mo\u0027 dead talk den we has.\" \"Steve,\" I pleaded, \"please don\u0027t tell her. I couldn\u0027t help learning something, and I pledge you my word that I don\u0027t know much. Why, there are hundreds of negroes all about here that can read as well as I can and their masters think nothing of it.\" \"Doan you fool yo\u0027se\u0027f \u0027bout dat, honey. Dar\u0027s er heap said erbout it. Da reads dem little flat books ter de uder niggers an\u0027 da gits whupped fur it, too. And de fust thing we knows you\u0027ll be readin\u0027 trouble on dis plan\u0027ation. I\u0027m gwine ter de house in de mornin\u0027 an\u0027 tell Ole Miss.\" \"Yes, and if you do, I\u0027ll have you whipped. Young Master won\u0027t put up with such an interference with his affairs. I belong to him and not to Old Miss.\" \"Ah, hah, but whut Ole Miss say comes mighty nigh bein\u0027 law sometimes. I\u0027se had my eye on you fur er laung time, an\u0027 I\u0027d like might\u0027ly ter see you out yander in de fiel\u0027 er brilin\u0027 er laung side o\u0027 me.\" I argued with him, threatened him, but it was of no use. He shook his head and declared that he would[Pg 63] tell Old Miss. And the next day he proved his mean nature. I kept a close watch on him and saw him start toward the house just as Old Miss stepped out upon the veranda. I can see him now, wool hat under arm, bowing to her. I knew that he expected a reward and I wondered what it would be. She listened and greatly to my surprise replied: \"Well, I hope he\u0027ll learn enough to behave himself.\" \"But goodness me, Ole Miss, ain\u0027t you gwine gib me suthin\u0027 fur all dis?\" the rascally tell-tale pleaded. She took out a small piece of money, tossed it to him and said: \"There. And now I want you to remember one thing—don\u0027t come to me with any more stories.\" She saw me as I dodged behind a corner of the dairy, and called me to her. \"Dan,\" she said as I came up the steps, \"I thought you had more sense than to create jealousies by exhibiting the crumbs of knowledge your master has permitted you to pick from under his table?\" I looked at her in surprise; surely the idea was not her own, but in her expression of it there was almost a majestic rebuke. I can see her now as she stood, her gray eyes fixed upon me, her silver-streaked hair parted flat, a bunch of authoritative keys hanging from her girdle. I gave her the all effective knee-bend of[Pg 64] submission, and recounted briefly the manner in which the black rascal had snared me. This amused her and she laughed with a cold cackle, but she did not strike me with her keys, as I had feared she would, though the memory of that feelingless laugh lived with me longer than the ache of a blow would have lasted on my head. Old Master came walking slowly out of the hall, with his spectacles on and with a letter in his hand. \"Madam,\" he said, \"Doctor Bates is coming back. Dan, saddle the sorrel horse and bring him round to the front gate.\" I hastened to the stable, musing upon the return of that trouble-brewing man. He had been home a number of times while Bob and I were off at school, but I had not seen him. More than once I had half suspected that he sought to marry Miss May, to fasten another grip upon the estate, but it did not seem possible that so gentle a woman could marry so hard a man. Yet, I was wise enough to know that we can never tell. A woman\u0027s heart is like a bird, beating upon the window at night, dazzled by the promise of a warmth within a glowing room, and seeing not an icy cruelty sitting beside the fire, lying in wait for a tender victim. While I was holding the horse, waiting for Master to mount, he paused, with his hand on the horn of the[Pg 65] saddle and said: \"Dan, when your Mars. George gets here, I want you to treat him with the greatest respect. Do you hear?\" \"Master,\" I replied grandiloquently, \"I might fail to hear it thunder, but I cannot fail to hear what you say.\" He looked at me and remarked: \"Look here, you are getting to be a good deal of a d—d fool.\" But I saw him chuckling as he turned his head away, and I knew that he was pleased. Masters liked the flattery of their slaves, and this is the reason that there is so much cozenage, even in the negro of to-day. \"Do you know why he is coming back?\" I ventured to ask. \"Coming back because this is his home, sir. And I don\u0027t want you to presume to ask such questions, sir. Well,\" he said, noticing that I was still holding the bridle, \"are you going to let me go, or must I stand here until you are ready to release me?\" \"I beg your pardon,\" I replied, stepping back. \"All right,\" he said as he rode away, and looking back he added: \"Remember that I want you to treat him with the greatest of respect.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3303/90306.html","bookId":423,"book":{"id":423,"title":"My Young Master","description":"简介： This is the story of a master, told by his slave.
