{"id":32279,"no":6,"title":"CHAPTER VI.","content":"I hid about the place during the day, sometimes peeping at the doctor from the hay-loft, sometimes dodging behind a cabin to keep out of his way, constantly wishing that Old Master might come; and late in the afternoon I saw him walking in the garden with his hands behind him. The doctor was not far away, and I knew that he would discover me if I should dart out from my hiding place, but I did finally and he yelled at me, but I ran to Old Master, looking back in fright as I approached him. \"Tut, tut, there!\" he cried. \"What are you running about this way for, tramping down everything? First thing you know I\u0027ll give you another whipping within an inch of your life!\" \"Marster!\" I cried, clinging to him, \"the doctor is after me!\" \"Well, he won\u0027t get you. Turn me loose. Hang about near me, but don\u0027t let your mistress see you. The doctor\u0027s going away to-morrow to be gone some time. Here he comes now. Go on to the house.\" [Pg 43] I passed the doctor, skirting far into a flower bed to give him plenty of room; he glowered at me and said nothing. But I knew that he would let slip no opportunity to harm me, and that night Bob and I barricaded our door. He had an old horse pistol that wouldn\u0027t shoot, and I had a broken saber, and we took turn about standing guard behind our breast-works. \"You\u0027ve been there long enough. Come on and lie down and let me stay there awhile?\" he would say; and he never failed to add: \"And you must pretend like you\u0027re asleep.\" At morning I awoke in bed and found Bob asleep behind the barricade. I aroused him, and he jumped up and declared that he had stood guard all night, and hadn\u0027t slept a wink. I pretended to believe him, and he rewarded me with a crock marble and a biscuit covered with sugar. Early that morning I had the satisfaction of seeing my enemy, the doctor, leave the plantation, and then followed a day of happiness, playing up and down the creek. At the house one other enemy was left, Old Miss, but I did not hate her, for her dislike of me could be none other than a divine right, something which I would not permit myself to question. She was cold and proud, and rarely did she give way to[Pg 44] the affection which she must have felt for her own children. It was said that she could trace her origin back to great warriors, and this gave a reason for her pride and her coldness; but Old Master\u0027s forefathers also were great fighters and statesmen, and yet he was warm-hearted and sympathetic. Aunt Mag told me that Old Miss had refused to marry Henry Clay because he was poor, and had always regretted it, but I could not see why, for surely my master was as great as Clay. The evening after the doctor left us, I was lying on the ground near the stone steps leading to the broad hall, when I heard Master and Old Miss talking. They were sitting on the portico and did not see me. \"I told him,\" said Master, \"that he might draw on me for what money he actually needs, but that I would put up with no extravagance. Of course, he has a sort of a claim, but I don\u0027t intend that he shall embarrass me in any way.\" She cleared her throat with a rasp that always made me shudder. \"He surely has a claim,\" she replied. \"Well, that\u0027s what I said, didn\u0027t I?\" \"Yes, but you seem to think that it is not much of a claim.\" \"I don\u0027t seem to think anything of the sort. He[Pg 45] shall have everything that is due him. But, madam, the truth of it is, he is of no account.\" \"He is a gentleman.\" \"In what way?\" I peeped up and saw him look hard at her. \"In what way has he shown himself a gentleman?\" \"He was born a gentleman,\" Old Miss replied. \"Born one, yes. His father and mother may have been good stock, but I tell you that he\u0027s a scrub. Still I will give him what\u0027s due him.\" \"Oh, I know that.\" \"Then there needn\u0027t be any further discussion about it.\" \"No,\" she said, \"not so far as I am concerned.\" And after a pause she asked: \"What\u0027s your object in sending Bob over to school at Layfield?\" \"To learn something, of course.\" \"But why can\u0027t he go to school at home? Can\u0027t he learn something here?\" \"We have had a teacher for him here and he has done no good.\" \"Yes, but can\u0027t you send him to school at the Academy in town?\" \"I could do it, of course, but I would rather have him go away. It will make him more important in[Pg 46] his own estimation—will give him more confidence in himself.\" \"Is Dan going with him?\" \"Oh, I knew what you were driving at. Yes,\" he almost shouted, \"Dan is going with him.\" \"I don\u0027t see why. Why not send Sam with him?\u0027\" \"Madam, is it necessary to explain to you that Dan is the property—property—\" \"I know all about that. But they are too much like companions, and will study together.\" He looked hard at her. \"Study together? And what of that?\" \"I don\u0027t want a child of mine studying with a negro. He has no business to study. He knows enough already! Educate him and he will be of no account on the face of the earth. I never knew it to fail. Mason had an educated negro, and what became of him? He ran away and went north and told a pack of lies about the people in this State, about the cruelties he had suffered, and the abolition papers are still harping on it.\" \"Yes, that\u0027s all true enough,\" said Old Master, \"but in Dan\u0027s case it will be different. He is not likely to pick up much learning, and besides he\u0027s grateful. He\u0027ll never run away.\" [Pg 47] \"I have been thinking,\" she said, \"that we might—\" \"Might do what?\" Master snapped before she had finished. \"Well, you know how much the doctor desires that boy. Why not let him—\" \"Madam!\" Master thundered, \"don\u0027t you know that the boy belongs to Bob? How long will it take you to learn that? Must I keep forever dinging it into your ears?\" \"Well, you needn\u0027t get mad about it.\" \"That\u0027s true, and I beg your pardon. But just let me manage it, if you please. I believe you said yesterday that our carriage is getting too old for you to ride about in?\" \"Yesterday? I have talked about it for the past year!\" \"Yes, so you have. Well, you may go to Louisville yourself and select one to suit you.\" That night I told Bob that we were going off to school together, and we grabbed each other in our glee. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3303/90304.html","bookId":423,"book":{"id":423,"title":"My Young Master","description":"简介： This is the story of a master, told by his slave.
