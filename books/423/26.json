{"id":32299,"no":26,"title":"CHAPTER XXVI.","content":"My Master\u0027s troop was composed for the most part of young men who had struggled with principle and with family opposition and who regarded it wise to meet in secret to prepare themselves for battle. In many families the dividing line ran as in our house, across the dinner table. Sometimes a \"Confederate\" and a \"Federal\" company would go through with their maneuvers in the same wood pasture; and on such occasions the strictest dignity and decorum were maintained, with never a jeer or idle word passing from one side to the other. The quarreling was indulged by older men and irresolute persons who had great bitterness, but not enough nerve to impel them into the ranks. From the moment when Young Master was forced openly to take his stand, his spirits seemed to rise, though my accustomed eye could sometimes see a sadness striving to pull his gayety down, as when he heard Old Master\u0027s voice or met him unexpectedly. Sometimes they saluted each other coldly as they passed, but often they appeared[Pg 271] almost to forget the difference lying like a shrouded corpse between them. One cool morning they met in the yard. By a silent agreement they no longer sat together at the table. \"A crisp and beautiful day,\" said the old man, bowing. \"By such a day I am always reminded of a shaggy dog we used to own—we called him Wolf. Do you remember him?\" \"Yes,\" Young Master answered, his countenance illumined with a sudden light. \"One of his eyes was brown and the other blue. He must have died long ago, for he seems now to trot around the outer rim of my recollection.\" At this figure the old man was so much pleased that he laughed. \"You were very young,\" he said, \"but little taller than old Wolf\u0027s back;\" and here he fell into a meditation, leaning against a locust tree. The dog was still in his mind when he spoke again. \"On a frosty day he was always frisky. He believed that the chill in the air foretold a rabbit hunt; and frequently it did. He used to come to my door early at morning and scratch to awake me. And I think he treed the first \u0027possum you ever saw. Old Simon brought the \u0027possum to the house, and you asked him why there was no hair on his tail. This gave him an [Pg 272]opportunity to tell a story that I heard when I was a boy and which has been told in every negro cabin. The Lord made a raccoon and the devil was so taken with the work that he was resolved to imitate it. Well, he made a thing as near like a coon as he could, but was so disgusted at the appearance of the result that he seized the animal by the tail and swung him round to dash his brains out against the jamb, but the hair slipped off, the animal escaped with his life but with a hairless tail. Yes, sir, and I believed the story until I was nearly grown.\" \"I remember the story,\" said Bob, \"though I don\u0027t recall the one particular \u0027possum used by Simon as an illustration. But I remember that Simon took me on his back one night, out into the woods where the dogs had treed one. It must have been long after Simon told the \u0027possum story, for I don\u0027t think that old Wolf went with us. He must have been dead.\" \"Yes, he was,\" the old man agreed. \"I recollect the night. A coon was treed in an enormous oak, and the boys were a long time in cutting it down. Do you remember, Dan?\" \"Yes, sir,\" I spoke up. \"It was the night that Mr. Bill Putney was killed in town by Mr. Tom Ellis Gray.\" [Pg 273] \"That\u0027s a fact,\" said the old man. \"But how do you happen to associate the two events?\" \"Why, when we came back to the house, a boy was waiting for you. They wanted you to come to town and go on a bond.\" \"But that couldn\u0027t have fastened it on your mind. What else was there? Out with it, sir.\" \"Why, Old Miss got mad at me for coming through the hall and slapped me off the front steps.\" \"Ah, that was it,\" he said, musing. \"And it seems long ago, even to me, much longer than happenings thirty years before.\" \"Dan,\" said Young Master, \"get my horse. But wait a moment. You may hitch up the buggy if you want to go over to Potter\u0027s with me.\" \"I don\u0027t care to go unless you would much rather have me,\" I replied. \"All right, then; saddle the horse.\" \"He has a love affair of his own, I am inclined to think,\" the old gentleman said, talking to Bob, but winking at me. \"How about it, Dan?\" I had turned to go, but had halted and faced about. \"A very empty love affair I am afraid, Master.\" \"Tut, sir, tut. There is no such thing as an empty[Pg 274] love affair if it\u0027s managed rightly. You are too faint-hearted. Do you remember what the poet said?\" This was the first time that he had addressed himself to what I conceived to be my learning, and I was flattered. \"You mean Pope\u0027s master, sir.\" \"Hang the scoundrel, to talk about Pope\u0027s master. He had no master, or if he had, he bought his freedom with his genius.\" I was still flattered and I made bold to venture upon a criticism. \"Not with his genius, but with his pains and his polish.\" \"Confound you, sir, go on and get that horse, you yellow scoundrel.\" When I had led the horse round to the gate, Bob and the old man came out talking in easy good-humor. \"Your mother is mightily tickled,\" said Old Master. \"She thinks you have drawn a prize. And so do I. She\u0027s a charming young woman, sir. But you have said nothing as to when the wedding is to take place.\" Bob had put his foot in the stirrup to mount, but he took it out and stood there irresolute, as if he knew not what to do or say. \"You haven\u0027t said a word as to the time set for the marriage,\" Old Master repeated. [Pg 275] \"No, sir. She is to wait—wait until I come home.\" A dark shadow fell upon the old man\u0027s face, and without another word, he wheeled about and strode into the yard. Old Miss came to the door and commanded me to bring a stick of wood to mend the parlor fire. When I went in with a log on my shoulder, I found Titine sitting by the fire, trying to amuse the little girl. \"Get out of the way, Jessie,\" she cried. \"Dan, let me help you ease it down.\" I was strong enough to have tossed the log in the air but I told her yes, and I caught at her hand as she stood close to lend her aid. She laughed and stepping back declared that I might help myself. I put the log into the fire-place and stood on the hearth to brush my coat. \"You ought to be proud of your strength,\" she said. \"That may be, and I ought to deplore my weakness.\" \"Yes, you ought. Jessie, don\u0027t go near the fire.\" \"And I do.\" \"Then you are climbing toward firmer ground. Put down the tongs, Jessie.\" \"The ground may be firm and yet slippery.\" \"If salt were given in exchange for words, you[Pg 276] might have enough to sell. Jessie, put down the cat; you\u0027ll get all covered with fleas.\" \"Titine, I believe that hateful and unjust remark made by Old Miss has set you against me. You cleave to it as if it were a piece of wisdom inspired of the Lord.\" \"But wasn\u0027t it the truth? And isn\u0027t there wisdom in all truth?\" \"No, it was not the truth. It was spite. She hates me and you ought to have sense enough to see it. But if truth were a diamond and sparkled in my favor, you would shut your eyes to it. I came to you with the devotion of a strong man. I showed you my heart. I threw it at your feet and let it flutter there, and so far from taking it up out of the dirt, you did not even look down upon it. You have no heart. An old woman killed it and left a senseless whim to vibrate in your breast. You could have made of me—\" \"Nothing,\" she broke in. \"How could I make anything of a thing that could never belong to me? Jessie, you\u0027ll fall out of that rocking chair if you don\u0027t mind. I once told you that I have the instincts of a lady, and I have, and I will not turn upon those instincts and mock them.\" \"But if you would only acknowledge that you care[Pg 277] for me,\" I pleaded; \"if you would only light a candle, call it hope and hold it aloft, no matter how far down the road, I could keep my eyes fastened upon it and live on faith.\" She looked at me, whether in pity or in scorn I could not tell. But I could gather no comfort from her words. \"Flies scorch their wings in the candle lighted down the road,\" she said. At this moment Old Miss came into the room. \"Why, gracious alive, why do you let that fire smoke so?\" she cried. \"Shove that log further back. I never saw as worthless a negro as you are. To bring a log in and throw it down right in front of the fire where it can do nothing but smoke! Go out. It makes me weary to look at you.\" She had not the opportunity much longer to look at me, for on the morrow, Young Master\u0027s troop, now but a play-thing, was to become a part of the great machinery of war. It was known that we were going, but at the supper table not a word bearing upon that subject was uttered by Old Miss, Mr. Clem or Miss May. We heard Old Master walking up and down the hall. At night Mr. Clem came to the room. \"Well, you march to-morrow, I suppose,\" said he. \"Yes,\" Young Master replied, \"we go, rain or shine.\" [Pg 278] \"And I go very soon. I am waiting for my commission. Having once been a soldier gives me some little importance.\" \"Uncle Clem, do you think we can get through within ninety days?\" \"Get through what?\" \"Do you think that the war will be over within that time?\" \"Yes, if the South lays down her arms.\" \"She won\u0027t do that.\" \"Then the war will last until she does. You people have a peculiar idea of this government. Do you think we are going to suffer it to go to pieces, that we will submit to disruption as long as there is an arm to strike? Why, the women in this community, your mother included, look upon it as a pic-nic excursion. Dan?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Are you going to shoot at the men who would free you?\" \"I am going with Young Master, sir, to do as he bids me.\" \"He is not going as a soldier, but as a servant, Uncle Clem.\" \"Same thing, Bob. The teamster is as much of a[Pg 279] soldier, when results are estimated, as the man who carries a gun. But it is all right, Dan. No one can hold you responsible. Bob, old Potter is a hot rebel, isn\u0027t he?\" \"Rampageous; and his daughter is making a Confederate flag—for me. We\u0027ll stop there and get it as we pass to-morrow.\" Early the next morning our troop was marshalled on the turn-pike about a mile from the house. From the rear veranda Old Master could see the flashing of their steel. He stood there gazing until Bob came out from breakfast. \"One moment,\" said the old man, stepping into the hall. \"You do not go with my curse, but with my wounded love. There, sir, not a word from you.\" They shook hands, but did not look into each other\u0027s eyes. Old Miss, Miss May and Mr. Clem walked with him to the gate. The parting was not sad, for no one of us, except Mr. Clem, attached much importance to the war cry, the bugle and the drum. Young Master mounted first, and then, turning to me, said: \"Dan, I have forgotten something. Run up stairs and get my Horace. You can overtake me.\" When I came down, Titine was standing alone at[Pg 280] the gate. \"They are about to leave you,\" she said, laughing. \"It would delight me to be left if I thought you—\" \"Too late for nonsense, now, Dan.\" \"You have made it too late for sense, Titine.\" \"Of course you blame me with everything.\" \"No, but I blame you with one thing, which, after all, is nearly everything—the death of my heart. But why talk of heart to a heartless creature—Titine, let me kiss you.\" \"Go away!\" she cried, waving me off. But I seized her in my arms, kissed her and sprang upon my horse. And she threw a stone at me as I galloped away. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3303/90324.html","bookId":423,"book":{"id":423,"title":"My Young Master","description":"简介： This is the story of a master, told by his slave.
