{"id":32277,"no":4,"title":"CHAPTER IV.","content":"The days grew hotter, the green corn waved on the hill-side, the wheat was ripening, but the deep mystery of death was over it all. The boy goes about his play, he shouts and has his daily contentions, his quarrels and fights, but darkness comes, and as he goes to his bed, his mind reverts to a soul that has recently taken its flight. Older people have the consoling prop of religion or the forceful brace of philosophy, but in the boy\u0027s nostrils lives the scent of the roses that lay upon the breast of mystic death; a fear possesses him as he peeps in at the parlor door. Ah, many days must fall upon a sad memory before it is sweetened. They told me that my young mistress was in Heaven. I asked Aunt Mag if she would be my mistress there, and she said no, that there was no mistresses in Heaven, no slaves, but all white and the angels of God. And with the flash of iconoclastic reason that comes to youth, I asked her why God made black people belong to white people on the earth and afterward made them all equal in Heaven. The old woman turned from her spinning[Pg 26] wheel and held up her hands in fright. \"Chile,\" she said, \"you musn\u0027t talk like dat. Whut de Lawd do it ain\u0027t fur us ter question, an\u0027 ef you wan\u0027t so young you mout git struck wid lightenin\u0027 fur sayin\u0027 dem words. Run off ober yander in de yard an\u0027 play. I\u0027se er feered de lightenin\u0027 mought strike at you anyhow.\" That night as Bob and I lay in our room, he in his high canopied bed, and I on my low lounge, I asked him if he knew that all the black people would be white in Heaven. \"Yes, of course,\" he answered. \"It would be a funny Heaven with a lot of niggers standing about, grinning.\" \"But they wouldn\u0027t have to grin.\" \"No, but they would.\" \"And you won\u0027t own me there, will you?\" I said, after a moment\u0027s silence. \"No, you\u0027ll belong to God.\" \"But don\u0027t I belong to God now?\" I heard him turn over. \"Yes, but you belong to me, too. And when I get through with you God may have you. Get over in my bed and I\u0027ll bet I can throw you out.\" \"No, Old Miss might hear us. But do you think,\" I asked after musing for a time, \"that we\u0027ll know each[Pg 27] other up there and talk about the time when we were down here?\" \"Yes; why not?\" \"But you\u0027d tell me that I used to belong to you and God wouldn\u0027t like that.\" \"Well, then, we won\u0027t say anything about it, but we\u0027ll think about it all the same.\" \"Yes, we\u0027d keep it to ourselves. But if a nigger angel beats a white angel flying, there\u0027ll be trouble, won\u0027t there?\" \"There won\u0027t be anything of that. God won\u0027t let the nigger angels out-fly the white ones.\" There came a tap at the door—a house-maid come to tell us that if we did not stop talking Old Miss would come in and whip us. We whispered and giggled a long time, and then Bob fell asleep, and I lay there thinking of the white roses that had scented the parlor. It must have been very late for the lights were out everywhere, when I heard voices on the walk just below my window. I looked out cautiously and in the moonlight I saw Old Master and Dr. George Bates. Master was walking up and down, but the doctor stood still. \"I want you to understand this,\" said the old man. \"You are at perfect liberty to stay here as long as you[Pg 28] choose—and I will feed you and clothe you, but you must have nothing whatever to say about the running of my affairs. You are constantly meddling with things that don\u0027t concern you.\" \"General, it is not my intention to interfere, I assure you.\" \"But you do,\" said Old Master, making an emphatic motion. \"You seem to think that I ought to divide my property with you. Get that out of your head as soon as you can.\" \"It has never been in my head, General. I merely suggested that if you would give me Dan I would take him and go South.\" \"Give you Dan! Confound it, haven\u0027t I told you that he belongs to Bob?\" \"Yes, but I didn\u0027t know but you gave him away just as a man sometimes gives a colt to a boy—merely to claim.\" \"I don\u0027t give things that way, sir.\" \"I know, but your wife—\" \"There, that will do.\" \"She said that she thought that you might be induced—\" \"Didn\u0027t I say that would do?\" \"Yes, sir, but let me finish, if you please. Of course[Pg 29] you know that my wife\u0027s share, whatever it may amount to, will fall to me?\" \"Yes, if I so desire it, sir.\" \"But I know you well enough to feel that you won\u0027t refuse me.\" \"Now you are presuming upon my kindness, sir.\" \"No, sir; I am paying a tribute to your sense of justice. And now this is what I have agreed to do: to take Dan and wait until you are ready—\" \"You have agreed with whom, sir?\" Old Master broke in. \"Oh, I don\u0027t know that it was exactly an agreement. I had a talk with your wife, and—\" \"Infamous puppy!\" Old Master cried, shaking his fist in the doctor\u0027s face. \"Didn\u0027t I tell you that you\u0027d gone far enough in that direction?\" \"General,\" said the doctor, stepping back, \"you have insulted me.\" Old Master snorted. \"Oh, I have insulted you, have I? Then I have done something that I thought must be impossible. Listen to me. You came here a beggar, with a doctor\u0027s sheep-skin under your arm; you are of a good family—that I will not deny. But I say you came a beggar, and you won my child—how, God only knows. You told me that you would [Pg 30]practice medicine on the plantation after you were married, but did you?\" \"Why, yes, sir; I have attended many a case. You know one very well.\" \"Oh, you have? Did you get out of bed when they sent for you one night to see old Aunt Mag? Didn\u0027t you complain that you were too sick to get up? And that very night, sir, didn\u0027t you slip away and play poker over the creek?\" \"Somebody has lied about me,\" the doctor declared. \"I admit, sir, that lying has been done, but you did it.\" \"General, I insist that you must not talk to me this way. I\u0027m no dog.\" \"If you were, sir, I would be more considerate of you.\" \"Keep on and you\u0027ll say something that you may regret.\" Just at that moment Old Master had turned to walk down the path, but he wheeled about. \"What\u0027s that? Say something that I may regret? I don\u0027t know about that, sir, but I may say something that you\u0027ll regret. I may tell you to get off this place, and I won\u0027t regret it, but you will.\" \"That would be a scandal, General.\" [Pg 31] \"Yes, a disgrace—to you.\" The old man walked down the path, tall and gaunt in the moon-light. He turned, and coming back, stepping slowly, he said: \"But it is our duty to avoid anything in the nature of a rupture. So now, I\u0027ll tell you what I\u0027ll agree to do. I will give you Sam and money enough to go South, and when the time comes to divide the estate, you shall have your share. Now, I ask you if that is not fair?\" \"Yes, General, it is perfectly fair, but—\" \"But what, sir?\" Master snapped impatiently. \"But I don\u0027t want Sam. I want Dan—want to make a race rider of him.\" \"What good will a race rider do you? You\u0027ve got no horses.\" \"I can get the horses.\" \"But you can\u0027t get Dan, sir, so let the matter rest. Bates, I don\u0027t want to get mad, and I should think, sir, that in the light of our recent affliction—\" \"I understand, General, and we\u0027ll let the subject drop, but if Bob should agree—\" \"Stop, there, sir. Bob is not old enough to entertain a business proposition.\" For a time the old man walked up and down, with his hands behind him and then turned upon the doctor. \"I believe, sir, that you are an evil-minded man. For a long time I thought[Pg 32] that your laziness was an indication of good nature—the lazy dog is rarely vicious—but now I am of the opinion that you have an active quality, that of rascality, sir.\" \"General,\" said the doctor, \"I can\u0027t stand everything. You forget, sir, that I am a gentleman.\" \"Oh, do I forget it?\" the old man spoke up. \"There is a difference between forgetting a thing and never having known it. Bates, I have endeavored to like you, I have striven to crush what I hoped was merely a prejudice, but I can\u0027t. I don\u0027t think that we have ever held an agreeable conversation. There is something about you that antagonizes me. When you are away I am determined to like you, but when you come back, I find that my resolve is weak. I don\u0027t want to drive you off—I would stand most anything rather than face a neighborhood scandal, but don\u0027t you think that it would be a good idea for you to go away and stay away for a long time? I say, don\u0027t you?\" \"You can drive me off, sir.\" \"Ah, the very thing you want me to do—you want to put my name into the mouths of the gossipers.\" \"General, you have called me a scoundrel and now you are trying to prove it. I can stand a great deal, but I can\u0027t put up with everything—even from you. I[Pg 33] have told you that I am a gentleman, and while a gentleman respects age, he cannot permit age to humiliate him. I know that you\u0027ve got nerve enough to shoot a man who rides into your room—\" \"Another word of that, Bates, and I will knock you down.\" \"You have gone too far,\" Bates replied in a tone that made me shiver. The moon shone upon his half upturned face and I fancied that I saw the glitter of his evil eyes. Master, who was now standing some distance from him said something which I did not catch and Bates, with his hand upraised, made a stride toward him. At my elbow, on a stand near the window, was a heavy glass tumbler. Indeed, I had long held it in my hand, and when Bates strode forward, I threw the tumbler with all my might. I heard it strike, and leaning out, I saw the doctor lying on the ground. I heard Old Master shout for a light, and now thoroughly frightened. I ran to my lounge and lay there with the cover drawn over my head. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3303/90302.html","bookId":423,"book":{"id":423,"title":"My Young Master","description":"简介： This is the story of a master, told by his slave.
