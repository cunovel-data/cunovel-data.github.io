She careful y drew the nail-polish brush over Meredith\u0027s toenail, painting it a tannish pink.\\n\\n They\u0027d spent the evening at freshman orientation with the rest of their dormmates, and now al they wanted to do was relax. \"Are you sure this is the color it\u0027s supposed to be?\" Elena asked Meredith. \"It doesn\u0027t look like a summer sunset to me.\"\\n\\n \"I like it,\" Meredith said, wiggling her toes.\\n\\n \"Careful! I don\u0027t want polish on my new bedspread,\" Elena warned.\\n\\n \"Zander is just gorgeous,\" Bonnie said, stretching out luxuriously on her own bed on the other side of the room.\\n\\n \"Wait til you meet him.\"\\n\\n Meredith smiled at Bonnie. \"Isn\u0027t it an amazing feeling?\\n\\n When you\u0027ve just met somebody and you feel like there\u0027s something between you, but you\u0027re not quite sure what\u0027s going to happen?\" She gave an exaggerated sigh, rol ing her eyes up in a mock swoon. \"It\u0027s al about the anticipation, and you get a thril just seeing him. I love that first part.\" Her tone was light, but there was something lonely in her face.\\n\\n Elena was sure that, as composed and calm as Meredith was, she was already missing Alaric.\\n\\n \"Sure,\" Bonnie said amiably. \"It\u0027s awesome, but I\u0027d like to get to the next stage for once. I want to have a relationship where we know each other real y Well, a serious boyfriend instead of just a crush. Like you guys have. That\u0027s even better, isn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n \"I think so,\" said Meredith. \"But you shouldn\u0027t try to hurry through the we-just-met stuff, because you\u0027ve only got a limited time to enjoy it. Right, Elena?\" Elena dabbed a cotton bal around the edges of Meredith\u0027s polished toenails and thought about when she had first met Stefan. With al that had happened since then, it was hard to believe it was only a year ago.\\n\\n What she remembered most was her own determination to have Stefan. No matter what had gotten in her way, she had known with a clear, firm purpose that he would be hers. And then, in those early days, once he was hers, it was glorious. It felt as if the missing piece of herself had slotted into place.\\n\\n \"Right,\" she said final y, answering Meredith. \"Afterward, things get more complicated.\"\\n\\n At first, Stefan had been a prize that Elena wanted to win: sophisticated and mysterious. He was a prize Caroline wanted, too, and Elena would never let Caroline beat her.\\n\\n But then Stefan had let Elena see the pain and passion, the integrity and nobility, he held inside him and she had forgotten the competition and loved Stefan with her whole heart.\\n\\n And now? She stil loved Stefan with everything she had, and he loved her. But she loved Damon, too, and sometimes she understood him - plotting, manipulative, dangerous Damon - better than she did Stefan. Damon was like her in some ways: he, too, would be relentless in pursuing what he wanted. She and Damon connected, she thought, on some deep core instinctive level that Stefan was too good, too honorable to understand. How could you love two people at the same time?\\n\\n \"Complicated,\" Bonnie scoffed. \"More complicated than never being sure if somebody likes you or not? More complicated than having to wait by the phone to see if you have a date for Saturday night or not? I\u0027m ready for complicated. Did you know that forty-nine percent of col ege-educated women meet their future husbands on campus?\"\\n\\n \"You made that statistic up,\" Meredith said, rising and picking her way toward her own bed, careful not to smudge her polish.\\n\\n Bonnie shrugged. \"Okay, maybe I did. But I bet it\u0027s a real y high percentage, anyway. Didn\u0027t your parents meet right here, Elena?\"\\n\\n \"They did,\" Elena said. \"I think they had a class together sophomore year.\"\\n\\n \"How romantic,\" Bonnie said happily.\\n\\n \"Well, if you get married, you have to meet your future spouse somewhere,\" Meredith said. \"And there are a lot of possible future spouses at col ege.\" She frowned at the silky cover on her bed. \"Do you think I can dry my nails faster if I use the hair dryer, or wil it mess up the polish? I want to go to sleep.\"\\n\\n She examined the hair dryer as if it were the focal point of some science experiment, her face intent. Bonnie was watching her upside down, her head tipped back off the end of the bed and her red curls brushing the floor, tapping her feet energetical y against the wal . Elena felt a great sWellof love for both of them. She remembered the countless sleepovers they\u0027d had al through school, back before their lives had gotten ... complicated.\\n\\n \"I love having the three of us together,\" she said. \"I hope the whole year is going to be just like this.\" That was when they first heard the sirens.\\n\\n Meredith peered through the blinds, col ecting facts, trying to analyze what was going on outside Pruitt House. An ambulance and several police cars were parked across the street, their lights silently blinking red and blue. Floodlights lit the quad a ghastly white, and it was crawling with police officers.\\n\\n \"I think we should go out there,\" she said.\\n\\n \"Are you kidding me?\" Bonnie asked from behind her.\\n\\n \"Why would we want to do that? I\u0027m in my pajamas.\" Meredith glanced back. Bonnie was standing, hands on hips, brown eyes indignant. She was indeed wearing cute ice-cream-cone-printed pajamas.\\n\\n \"Well, quick, put on some jeans,\" Meredith said.\\n\\n \"But why?\" asked Bonnie plaintively.\\n\\n Meredith\u0027s eyes met Elena\u0027s across the room, and they nodded briskly to each other.\\n\\n \"Bonnie,\" Elena said patiently, \"we have a responsibility to check out everything that\u0027s going on around here. We might just want to be normal col ege students, but we know the truth about the world - the truth other people don\u0027t realize, about vampires and werewolves and monsters - and we need to make sure that what\u0027s going on out there isn\u0027t part of that truth. If it\u0027s a human problem, the police wil deal with it. But if it\u0027s something else, it\u0027s our responsibility.\"\\n\\n \"Honestly,\" grumbled Bonnie, already reaching for her clothes, \"you two have a - a saving-people complex or something. After I take psychology, I\u0027m going to diagnose you.\"\\n\\n \"And then we\u0027l be sorry,\" Meredith said agreeably.\\n\\n On their way out the door, Meredith grabbed the long velvet case that held her fighting stave. The stave was special, designed to fight both human and supernatural adversaries, and was made to specifications handed down through her family for generations. Only a Sulez could have a staff like this. She caressed it through the case, feeling the sharp spikes of different materials that dotted its ends: silver for werewolves, wood for vampires, white ash for Old Ones, iron for al eldritch creatures, tiny hypodermics to fil with poisons. She knew she couldn\u0027t take the stave out of its case on the quad, not surrounded by police officers and innocent bystanders, but she felt stronger when she could feel the weight of it in her hand.\\n\\n Outside, the mugginess of the Virginia September day had given way to a chil y night, and the girls walked quickly toward the crowd around the quad.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t look like we\u0027re heading straight over there,\" Meredith whispered. \"Pretend we\u0027re going to one of the buildings. Like the student center.\" She angled off slightly, as if she was heading past the quad, and then led them closer, glancing over at the police tape surrounding the grass, pretending to be surprised by the activity next to them. Elena and Bonnie fol owed her lead, looking around wide-eyed.\\n\\n \"Can I help you ladies?\" one of the campus security men asked, stepping forward to block their progress.\\n\\n Elena smiled at him appealingly. \"We were just on our way to the student center, and we saw everyone out here.\\n\\n What\u0027s going on?\"\\n\\n Meredith craned her head to look past him. Al she could see were groups of police officers talking to one another and more campus security. Some officers were on their hands and knees, searching careful y through the grass. Crime scene analysts, she thought vaguely, wishing she knew more about police procedure than what she\u0027d seen on TV.\\n\\n The security officer stepped sideways to block her view.\\n\\n \"Nothing serious, just a girl who ran into a bit of trouble walking out here alone.\" He smiled reassuringly.\\n\\n \"What kind of trouble?\" Meredith asked, trying to see for herself.\\n\\n He shifted, blocking her line of sight again. \"Nothing to worry about. Everyone\u0027s going to be okay this time.\"\\n\\n \"This time?\" Bonnie asked, frowning.\\n\\n He cleared his throat. \"You girls just stick together at night, okay? Make sure to walk in pairs or groups when you\u0027re out around campus, and you\u0027l be fine. Basic safety stuff, right?\"\\n\\n \"But what happened to the girl? Where is she?\" Meredith asked.\\n\\n \"Nothing to worry about,\" he said, more firmly this time.\\n\\n His eyes were on the black velvet case in Meredith\u0027s hand.\\n\\n \"What have you got in there?\"\\n\\n \"Pool cue,\" she lied. \"We\u0027re going to play pool in the student center.\"\\n\\n \"Have a good time,\" he said, in a tone of voice that was clearly a dismissal.\\n\\n \"We wil ,\" Elena said sweetly, her hand on Meredith\u0027s arm. Meredith opened her mouth to ask another question, but Elena was pul ing her away from the officer and toward the student center.\\n\\n \"Hey,\" Meredith objected quietly, when they were out of earshot. \"I wasn\u0027t done asking questions.\"\\n\\n \"He wasn\u0027t going to tel us anything,\" Elena said. Her mouth was a grim straight line. \"I bet a lot more happened than someone getting into a little trouble. Did you see the ambulances?\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re not real y going to the student center, are we?\" Bonnie asked plaintively. \"I\u0027m too tired.\" Meredith shook her head. \"We\u0027d better loop back behind the buildings to our dorm, though. It\u0027l look suspicious if we head right back where we came from.\"\\n\\n \"That was creepy, right?\" Bonnie said. \"Do you think\" - she paused, and Meredith could see her swal ow - \"do you think something real y bad happened?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" Meredith said. \"He said a girl ran into a little bit of trouble. That could mean anything.\"\\n\\n \"Do you think someone attacked her?\" Elena asked.\\n\\n Meredith shot her a significant look. \"Maybe,\" she said.\\n\\n \"Or maybe something did.\"\\n\\n \"I hope not,\" Bonnie said, shivering. \"I\u0027ve had enough somethings to last me forever.\" They\u0027d crossed behind the science building, down a darker, lonelier path, and circled back toward their dorm, its brightly lit entryway like a beacon before them. Al three sped up, heading for the light.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got my key,\" Bonnie said, feeling in her jeans pocket. She opened the door, and she and Elena hurried into the dorm.\\n\\n Meredith paused and glanced back toward the busy quad, then, past it, at the dark sky above campus.\\n\\n Whatever \"trouble\" had happened, and whether the cause was human or something else, she knew she needed to be in top condition, ready to fight.\\n\\n She could almost hear her father\u0027s voice saying, \"Fun time is over, Meredith.\" It was time to focus on her training again, time to work toward her destiny as a protector, as a Sulez, to keep innocent people safe from the darkness. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hunters-moonsong-the-vampire-diaries-2/page-4.html","bookId":2067,"book":{"id":2067,"title":"The Hunters: Moonsong (The Vampire Diaries #2)","description":"Storyline: Moonsong (The Vampire Diaries: The Hunters, #2) \\n After escaping the horrors of the Dark Dimension, Elena and her friends can\u0027t wait to attend Dalcrest College, the beautiful ivy-covered campus where Elena\u0027s parents met.
