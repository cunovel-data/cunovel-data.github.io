He felt empty inside, an automaton making perfect identical shots.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t real y love basketbal . For him, it lacked both the satisfying contact of footbal and the mathematical precision of pool. But it was something to do. He\u0027d been up al night and al morning, and he couldn\u0027t stand the endless pacing of his own feet around the campus, or the sight of the four wal s of his room.\\n\\n What was he going to do now? There didn\u0027t seem to be much point to going to school without Elena beside him. He tried to block out his memories of the centuries of wandering the world alone, without her, without Damon, that preceded his coming to Fel \u0027s Church. He was shutting down his emotions as hard as he could, forcing himself numb, but he couldn\u0027t help dimly wondering if centuries of loneliness were in store for him again.\\n\\n \"Quite a talent you got there,\" a shadow said, stepping away from the bleachers. \"We should have recruited you for the basketbal team, too.\"\\n\\n \"Matt,\" Stefan acknowledged, making another basket, then tossing the bal to him.\\n\\n Matt lined up careful y to the basket and shot, and it circled the rim before dropping through.\\n\\n Stefan waited while Matt ran to get the bal , then turned to him. \"Were you looking for me?\" he asked, careful y not asking if Elena had sent him.\\n\\n Looking surprised, Matt shook his head. \"Nah. I like to shoot baskets when I\u0027ve got some thinking to do. You know.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s going on?\" Stefan asked.\\n\\n Matt rubbed the back of his neck, embarrassed. \"There was this girl who I kind of liked, who I\u0027ve been thinking about for a while, wanting to ask out. And, uh, it turns out she already has a boyfriend.\"\\n\\n \"Oh.\" After a few minutes, Stefan realized he ought to respond with something more. \"I\u0027m sorry to hear that.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah.\" Matt sighed. \"She\u0027s real y special. I thought - I don\u0027t know, it would be nice to have something like what you and Elena have. Someone to love.\"\\n\\n Stefan winced. It felt like Matt had twisted a knife in his gut. He flung the bal at the basket, not aiming this time, and it bounced back at them hard off the backboard. Matt jumped to catch it, then moved toward him, holding out a hand. \"Hey, hey, Stefan. Take it easy. What is it?\"\\n\\n \"Elena and I aren\u0027t seeing each other anymore,\" Stefan said flatly, trying to ignore the stab of pain from saying the words. \"She - I saw her kissing Damon.\"\\n\\n Matt looked at Stefan silently for what felt like a long time, his pale blue eyes steady and compassionate. Stefan was struck sharply by the memory that Matt had loved Elena, too, and that they had been together before Stefan came into the picture.\\n\\n \"Look,\" Matt said final y. \"You can\u0027t control Elena. If there\u0027s one thing I know about her - and I\u0027ve known her for our whole lives - it\u0027s that she\u0027s always going to do what she wants to do, no matter what gets in her way. You can\u0027t stop her.\" Stefan began to nod, hot tears burning behind his eyes. \"But,\" Matt added, \"I also know that, in the end, you\u0027re the one for her. She\u0027s never felt the way she does about you for anyone else. And, y\u0027know, I\u0027m starting to discover that there are other girls out there, but I don\u0027t think you\u0027re going to. Whatever\u0027s going on with Damon, Elena wil come back to you. And you\u0027d be an idiot not to let her, because she\u0027s the only one for you.\"\\n\\n Stefan rubbed the bridge of his nose. He felt breakable, like his bones were made of glass. \"I don\u0027t know, Matt,\" he said tiredly.\\n\\n Matt grinned sympathetical y. \"Yeah, but I do.\" He tossed Stefan the bal and Stefan caught it automatical y.\\n\\n \"Want to play Horse?\"\\n\\n He was tired and heartsick, but, as he dribbled the bal , thinking that he\u0027d have to take it a tiny bit easy to give Matt a chance, Stefan felt a stirring of hope. Maybe Matt was right.\\n\\n \"Are you crazy?\" Bonnie shouted. She had always thought that \"seeing red\" was just a metaphor, but she was so angry that she actual y was seeing the faintest scarlet touch on everything, as if the whole room had been dipped in blood-tinged water.\\n\\n Meredith and Elena exchanged glances. \"We\u0027re not saying there is anything wrong with Zander,\" Meredith said gently. \"It\u0027s just that we want you to be careful.\"\\n\\n \"Careful?\" Bonnie gave a mean, bitter little laugh and shoved past them to grab a duffel bag out of her closet.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re just jealous,\" she said without looking at them. She unzipped the bag and started to dump in some clothes.\\n\\n \"Jealous of what, Bonnie?\" Elena asked. \"I don\u0027t want Zander.\"\\n\\n \"Jealous because I\u0027m final y the one who has a boyfriend,\" Bonnie retorted. \"Alaric is back in Fel \u0027s Church, and you broke up with both your boyfriends, and you don\u0027t like seeing me happy when you\u0027re miserable.\" Elena shut her mouth tightly, white spots showing on her cheekbones, and turned away. Eyeing Bonnie careful y, Meredith said, \"I told you what I saw, Bonnie. It\u0027s nothing definite, but I\u0027m afraid that the person who attacked that girl might have been Zander. Can you tel me where he was after you two left the party last night?\" Focusing on stuffing her favorite jeans into what was already starting to seem like an overcrowded bag, Bonnie didn\u0027t answer. She could feel an annoying tel tale flush spreading up her neck and over her face. Fine, this was probably enough clothes. She could grab her toothbrush and moisturizer from the bathroom on her way down the hal .\\n\\n Meredith came toward her, hands open and outstretched placatingly. \"Bonnie,\" she said gently, \"we do want you to be happy. We real y do. But we want you to be safe, too, and we\u0027re worried that Zander might not be everything you think he is. Maybe you could stay away from him, just for a little while? While we check things out?\" Bonnie zipped up her bag, threw it over her shoulder, and headed for the door, brushing past Meredith without a glance. She was planning to just walk out but, at the last minute, wheeled around in the doorway to face them again, unable to bite back what she was thinking.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s kil ing me here,\" she said, \"is what hypocrites you two are. Don\u0027t you remember when Mr. Tanner was murdered? Or the tramp who was almost kil ed under Wickery Bridge?\" She was actual y shaking with fury.\\n\\n \"Everyone in the whole town thought Stefan was responsible. Al the evidence pointed at him. But Meredith and I didn\u0027t think so, because Elena told us she knew Stefan couldn\u0027t have done it, that he wouldn\u0027t have done it.\\n\\n And we believed you, even though you didn\u0027t have any proof to give us,\" she said, staring at Elena, who dropped her eyes to the floor. \"I would have thought you could trust me the same way.\" She looked back and forth between them. \"The fact that you\u0027re suspecting Zander even though I\u0027m standing here, tel ing you he would never hurt anybody, makes it clear that you don\u0027t respect me,\" she said coldly.\\n\\n \"Maybe you never did.\"\\n\\n Bonnie stomped out of the room, hitching the strap of the duffel bag higher on her shoulder.\\n\\n \"Bonnie\" she heard behind her and turned to look back one more time. Meredith and Elena were both reaching after her, identical expressions of frustration on their faces.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to Zander\u0027s,\" Bonnie told them curtly. That would show them what she thought about their suspicions of him.\\n\\n She slammed the door behind her. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hunters-moonsong-the-vampire-diaries-2/page-27.html","bookId":2067,"book":{"id":2067,"title":"The Hunters: Moonsong (The Vampire Diaries #2)","description":"Storyline: Moonsong (The Vampire Diaries: The Hunters, #2) \\n After escaping the horrors of the Dark Dimension, Elena and her friends can\u0027t wait to attend Dalcrest College, the beautiful ivy-covered campus where Elena\u0027s parents met.
