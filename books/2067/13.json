She just could not bring herself to knock on Matt\u0027s door. Instead, she turned big pleading brown eyes on Meredith and Elena.\n \"Oh, Bonnie,\" Meredith muttered, reaching past her, shifting the pile of bagels and the carton of orange juice she was carrying, and rapping loudly on the door.\n \"I don\u0027t know what to say,\" Bonnie whispered back, agonized.\n Then the door opened, and Matt appeared, red-eyed and pale. He seemed somehow smal er and more hunched into himself than Bonnie had ever seen him. Overwhelmed with pity, she forgot al about being nervous and launched herself into his arms, dropping the muffin in the process.\n \"I\u0027m so sorry,\" she choked out, tears running down her face. Matt held on to her tightly, bending over and burying his head in her shoulder. \"It\u0027s okay,\" she said final y, desperately, patting the back of his head. \"I mean, no, it\u0027s not ... of course it\u0027s not ... but we love you, we\u0027re here.\"\n \"I couldn\u0027t help him,\" Matt said dul y, his face stil pressed against Bonnie\u0027s neck. \"I tried my best, but he died anyway.\"\n Elena and Meredith joined them, wrapping their arms around Matt from either side.\n \"We know,\" Elena said, rubbing his back. \"You did everything you could for him.\"\n Matt pul ed out of their arms eventual y and gestured around the room. \"Al this stuff is his,\" he said. \"His parents don\u0027t feel like they\u0027re ready to clear out his things yet, they told the police. It\u0027s kil ing me to see it al stil here when he\u0027s not. I thought about packing it up for his parents, but there\u0027s a possibility that the police might want to look through his stuff.\"\n Bonnie shuddered at the thought of what Christopher\u0027s parents must be going through.\n \"Have something to eat,\" Meredith said. \"I bet you haven\u0027t eaten for ages. Maybe it\u0027l help you feel better.\" Al three girls fussed around, fixing the breakfast they\u0027d brought for Matt, then convincing him to taste something, anything. He drank some juice and picked at a bagel, his head lowered. \"I was at the police station al night,\" he said.\n \"I had to keep going over and over what happened.\"\n \"What did happen?\" Bonnie asked tentatively.\n Matt sighed. \"I real y wish I knew. I just saw somebody dressed in black running away from Christopher. I wanted to chase him, but Chris needed my help. And then he died. I tried, but I couldn\u0027t do anything.\" His forehead creased into a frown. \"The real y weird thing, though,\" he said slowly, \"is that, even though I saw a person running away, the police think Christopher was attacked by some kind of animal. He was ... pretty ripped up.\"\n Elena and Meredith exchanged an alert glance. \"A vampire?\" said Meredith. \"Or a werewolf, maybe?\"\n \"I was wondering about that,\" Matt admitted. \"It makes sense.\" Without seeming to notice, he finished his bagel, and Elena took advantage of his distraction to slip some fruit onto his plate.\n Bonnie wrapped her arms around herself. \"Why?\" she asked. \"Why is it that, wherever we go, weird, scary things happen around us? I thought that once we left Fel \u0027s Church things would be different.\"\n No one argued with her. For a little while, they al sat quietly, and Bonnie felt as if they were huddling together, trying to protect themselves from something cold and horrible.\n Final y, Meredith reached out and took an orange slice off Matt\u0027s plate. \"The first thing we need to do, then, is to investigate and try to figure out if these attacks and disappearances are supernatural.\" She chewed thoughtful y. \"As much as I hate to say it, we should probably get Damon on this. He\u0027s good at this kind of thing. And Stefan should know what\u0027s going on, too.\" She looked at Elena, her voice gentle. \"I\u0027l talk to them, okay, Elena?\" Elena shrugged. Bonnie could tel she was trying to keep her expression blank, but her lips were trembling. \"Of course,\" she said after a minute. \"I\u0027m sure they\u0027re both checking things out anyway. You know how paranoid they are.\"\n \"Not without reason,\" Meredith said dryly.\n Matt\u0027s eyes were wet. \"Whatever happens, I need you to promise me something,\" he said. \"Please, be careful. I can\u0027t - let\u0027s not lose anyone else, okay?\" Bonnie snuggled closer to him, putting her hand on his.\n Meredith reached over and placed her hand over both of theirs, and Elena added hers to the pile. \"We\u0027l take care of one another,\" Elena said.\n \"A vow,\" said Bonnie, trying to smile. \"We\u0027l always watch out for one another. We\u0027l make sure everyone is safe.\"\n At that moment, as they murmured in agreement, she was sure they could do it.\n Meredith pivoted and stepped forward, swinging her staff down to strike at Samantha\u0027s heavily padded knees.\n Samantha dodged the blow, then jabbed her own staff straight toward Meredith\u0027s head. Meredith blocked the blow, then thrust her staff at Samantha\u0027s chest.\n Samantha staggered backward and lost her footing.\n \"Wow,\" she said, rubbing her col arbone and looking at Meredith with a mixture of resentment and appreciation.\n \"That hurt, even with the padding. I\u0027ve never trained with anyone so strong before.\"\n \"Oh, Well,\" Meredith said modestly, feeling absurdly pleased, \"I practice a lot.\"\n \"Uh-huh,\" Samantha said, eyeing her. \"Let\u0027s take a break.\" She flopped down on the mat, and Meredith, her staff balanced lightly in one hand, sat beside her.\n It wasn\u0027t her staff, of course, not her special hunting one.\n She couldn\u0027t bring her heirloom slayer staff to the gym - it was too clearly a customized deadly weapon. But she\u0027d been delighted to learn that Samantha could fight with a four-foot-long jo staff and that she had an extra.\n Samantha was quick and smart and fierce, one of the best sparring partners she\u0027d ever had. Fighting, Meredith was able to block out the helpless feeling she\u0027d had in Matt\u0027s room this morning. There was something so pathetic about seeing al Christopher\u0027s things sitting there ready for him, when he was never coming back. He had one of those weird little fake Zen gardens on his desk, the sand neatly groomed. Maybe just the day before, Christopher had picked up the tiny rake in his hand and smoothed the sand, and now he\u0027d never touch anything again.\n And it was her fault. Meredith squeezed her staff, her knuckles whitening. She had to accept that. If she had the power of being a potent force against darkness, a hunter and slayer of monsters, she had the responsibility, too.\n Anything that got through and kil ed someone in her territory was Meredith\u0027s failure and her shame.\n She had to work harder. Practice more, go out patrol ing the campus, keep people safe.\n \"Are you al right?\" Samantha\u0027s voice broke through Meredith\u0027s thoughts. Startled, Meredith saw Samantha staring at her with wide, solemn dark eyes, taking in Meredith\u0027s gritted teeth and clenched fists.\n \"Not entirely,\" said Meredith dryly. \"Um.\" She felt like she had to explain her grimness. \"Did you hear about what happened last night, the guy who was kil ed?\" Samantha nodded slowly, her expression unreadable. \"Well, he was the roommate of a real y good friend of mine. And I was with my friend today, trying to help him. It was ... upsetting.\" Samantha\u0027s face seemed to harden, and she scrambled up on her knees. \"Listen, Meredith,\" she said, \"I promise you this isn\u0027t going to happen again. Not on my watch.\"\n \"On your watch?\" Meredith asked mildly. Suddenly, it felt hard to breathe.\n \"I have responsibilities,\" Samantha said. She dropped her eyes to her hands. \"I\u0027m going to catch this kil er.\"\n \"It\u0027s a big job,\" Meredith said. It wasn\u0027t possible, was it?\n But Samantha was such a good fighter, and what she was saying ... why would she think she was responsible for stopping the kil er? \"What makes you think you can do it?\" she asked.\n \"I know this is difficult to believe, and I shouldn\u0027t even be tel ing you, but I need your help.\" Samantha was looking straight into her eyes, practical y vibrating with earnestness.\n \"I\u0027m a hunter. I was raised to... I have a sacred trust. Al my family for generations, we\u0027ve fought against evil. I\u0027m the last of us. My parents were kil ed when I was thirteen.\" Meredith gasped, shocked, but Samantha shook her head fiercely, pushing Meredith\u0027s sympathy away. \"They hadn\u0027t finished training me,\" she continued, \"and I need you to help me get better, get faster. I\u0027m not strong enough yet.\" Meredith stared at her.\n \"Please, Meredith,\" Samantha said. \"I know it sounds crazy, but it\u0027s true. People are depending on me.\" Unable to stop herself, Meredith started to laugh.\n \"It\u0027s not a joke,\" Samantha said, jumping to her feet, her fists clenched. \"This is... I shouldn\u0027t have said anything.\" She stalked toward the door, her back as straight as a soldier\u0027s.\n \"Samantha, wait,\" Meredith cal ed. Samantha whirled back toward her with a face ful of fury. Meredith took a quick breath and tried desperately to remember something she\u0027d learned as a child but never had occasion to use.\n Crooking her pinkies together, she drew up her thumbs to make a triangle, the secret sign of greeting between two hunters.\n Samantha just stared at her, face perfectly blank.\n Meredith wondered if she remembered the sign correctly.\n Had Samantha\u0027s family even taught it to her? Meredith knew there were other families out there, but she had never met any of them before. Her parents had left the hunter community before she was born.\n Then Samantha, moving as quickly as she ever had when they\u0027d sparred, was before her, gripping her arms.\n \"For real?\" Samantha said. \"Are you serious?\" Meredith nodded, and Samantha threw her arms around her and clutched her tightly. Her heart was beating so hard that Meredith could feel it. Meredith stiffened at first - she wasn\u0027t the touchy-feely type, despite being best friends with wildly affectionate Bonnie for years - but then relaxed into the hug, feeling Samantha\u0027s slim, muscular body under her arms, so like her own.\n She had the strangest feeling of familiarity, as if she had been lost and had now found her true family at last.\n Meredith knew she could never say any of that, and part of her felt like she was betraying Elena and Bonnie just by thinking that way, but she couldn\u0027t help it. Samantha pul ed away, smiling and weepy, wiping at her eyes and nose.\n \"I\u0027m acting stupid,\" she said. \"But this is the best thing that ever happened to me. Together, we can fight this.\" She gave a half-hysterical sniff and gazed at Meredith with huge shining eyes. \"I feel like I\u0027ve made a new best friend,\" she said.\n \"Yes,\" Meredith said - not weeping, not laughing, cool as ever on the outside but, inside, feeling like she was breaking into happy pieces - \"yes, I think you\u0027re right.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hunters-moonsong-the-vampire-diaries-2/page-13.html","bookId":2067,"book":{"id":2067,"title":"The Hunters: Moonsong (The Vampire Diaries #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Moonsong (The Vampire Diaries: The Hunters, #2) \n After escaping the horrors of the Dark Dimension, Elena and her friends can\u0027t wait to attend Dalcrest College, the beautiful ivy-covered campus where Elena\u0027s parents met.
