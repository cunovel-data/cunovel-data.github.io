He wasn\u0027t eating. Human food didn\u0027t have much taste for him now, and he\u0027d used his Power to cal down a dove to his balcony that morning. That had provided enough blood to hold him until the evening, when he would need to hunt again. Once Elena final y made herself a salad, he led her to the empty table he\u0027d spotted. She kissed him before she sat down and a shiver of delight ran through him as their minds touched. The familiar link between them slid into place, and he felt Elena\u0027s joy, her contentment at being with him and at their new, nearly normal, lives. Below this, a touch of excitement fizzed through her, and Stefan sent a questioning thought between them, wondering what had happened since they\u0027d seen each other that morning. Elena broke the kiss and answered his unspoken question. \"Professor Campbel , my history professor, knew my parents when they were in col ege,\" she said. Her voice was calm, but her eyes were bright, and Stefan could sense how big this was for her. \"He was a real y good friend of theirs. He can tel me stories about them, parts of their lives I never knew before.\" \"That\u0027s great,\" Stefan said, pleased for her. \"How was the class?\" \"It was al right,\" Elena said, beginning to eat her salad. \"We\u0027re talking about the colonial days for the first couple of weeks.\" She looked up, her fork poised in midair. \"How about you? What was your philosophy class like?\" \"Fine.\" Stefan paused. Fine wasn\u0027t real y what he meant. It had been strange to be sitting in a col ege classroom again. He\u0027d attended col ege a few times during his long history, seen the changing fads in education. At first, his classmates had been a select number of wealthy young men, and now there was a more diverse mix of boys and girls. But there was an essential sameness to al those experiences. The professor lecturing, the students either bored or eager. A certain shal owness of thought, a shy ducking away from exposing deeper feelings. Damon was right. Stefan didn\u0027t belong here; he was just playing a role, again. Kil ing some of his limitless time. But Elena - he looked at her, her shining blue eyes fixed on him - she did belong here. She deserved the chance at a normal life, and he knew she wouldn\u0027t have come to col ege without him. Could he say any of this to her? He didn\u0027t want to dim the excitement in those lapis lazuli eyes, but he had sworn to himself that he would always be honest with her, would treat her as an equal. He opened his mouth, hoping to explain some of what he felt. \"Did you hear about Daniel Greenwater?\" a girl asked nearby, her voice high with curiosity as she and her friends slid into the empty chairs on the other end of the table. Stefan closed his mouth and turned his head to listen. \"Who\u0027s Daniel Greenwater?\" someone else asked. \"Look,\" the first girl said, unfolding a newspaper she held. Glancing over, Stefan saw it was the campus paper. \"He\u0027s a freshman, and he just vanished. He left the student center when it closed last night, and his roommate says he never came back to the room. It\u0027s real y creepy.\" Stefan\u0027s eyes met Elena\u0027s across the table, and she raised an eyebrow thoughtful y. Could this be something they should look into? Another girl at the other end of the table shrugged. \"He probably just got stressed out and went home. Or maybe his roommate kil ed him. You know you get automatic As if your roommate dies.\" \"That\u0027s a myth,\" Stefan said absently, and the girls looked up at him in surprise. \"Could I see the paper for a moment, please?\" They passed it over, and Stefan studied the picture on the front. A high school yearbook photo smiled up at him, a skinny floppy-haired guy with a slight overbite and friendly eyes. A face he recognized. He had thought the name sounded familiar. \"He lives in our dorm,\" he said softly to Elena. \"Remember him from orientation? He seemed happy to be here. I don\u0027t think he would have left, not of his own free wil .\" Elena stared at him, her wide eyes apprehensive now. \"Do you think something bad happened to him? There was something weird going on in the quad the first night we were here.\" She swal owed. \"They said a girl had gotten into some trouble, but the cops wouldn\u0027t real y tel us anything. Do you think it might be related to Daniel Greenwater\u0027s disappearance?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" Stefan said tightly, \"but I\u0027m worried. I don\u0027t like anything out of the ordinary.\" He stood up. \"Are you ready to go?\" Elena nodded, although half her lunch was stil on her tray. Stefan handed the paper politely back to the girls and fol owed Elena outside. \"Maybe we\u0027re paranoid because we\u0027re used to terrible things happening,\" Elena said, once they were on the path heading back up the hil toward their dorm. \"But people disappear al the time. Girls get harassed or attacked sometimes. It\u0027s unfortunate, but it doesn\u0027t mean there\u0027s a sinister plot behind it al .\" Stefan paused, staring at a flyer stuck to a tree by the cafeteria. Missing Student, the caption said, with a picture of a girl beneath it. \"Promise me you\u0027l be careful, Elena,\" he said. \"Tel Meredith and Bonnie, too. And Matt. None of you should be wandering around campus by yourselves. Not at night, anyway.\" Elena nodded, her face pale, staring at the picture on the flyer. Stefan felt a sharp pang of regret even through his anxiety. She had been so excited when they met for lunch, and now that enthusiasm had drained away. He wrapped his arm around her waist, wanting to hold her, to keep her safe. \"Why don\u0027t we go out tonight?\" he said. \"I\u0027ve got a study group to go to, but it shouldn\u0027t last too long. We could go off campus for dinner. Maybe you could stay over tonight? I\u0027d feel better if I knew you were safe.\" Elena looked at him, her eyes suddenly sparkling with laughter. \"Oh, as long as that\u0027s the only reason you\u0027d want me in your room,\" she said, smiling. \"I\u0027d hate to think you had designs on my virtue.\" Stefan thought of Elena\u0027s creamy skin and silky golden hair, of her warmth, the rich wine of her blood. The idea of her in his arms again, without her aunt Judith or his landlady, Mrs. Flowers, down the hal , was intoxicating. \"Of course not,\" he murmured, bowing his head toward hers. \"I have no designs. I live only to serve you.\" He kissed Elena again, sending al his love and longing to her. Above their heads, Stefan heard a strident cawing and the flapping of wings, and, his lips stil against Elena\u0027s, he frowned. Elena seemed to sense his sudden tension and pul ed away from him, fol owing his gaze toward the black crow wheeling above them. Damon. Watching them, watching Elena, as always. \"Excel ence.\" Ethan\u0027s voice rang out across the outdoor basketbal court where the pledges were gathered. Dawn was breaking, and there was no one around except for Ethan and the sleepy-faced pledges. \"As you know from our first meeting, each of you here exemplifies the peak of one or more types of achievement. But that\u0027s not enough.\" He paused, looking from face to face. \"It\u0027s not enough for each of you to have a piece of the best. You can encompass al these attributes in yourself. Over the course of the pledge period, you wil discover worlds inside yourselves that you\u0027ve never imagined.\" Matt shuffled his sneakers against the asphalt and tried to keep the skeptical expression off his face. Expecting him to achieve the heights of academic or artistic success, he knew, was a long shot. He wasn\u0027t particularly modest, but he was realistic, and he could list his best qualities: athlete, good friend, honorable guy. He wasn\u0027t stupid, either, but if excel ing in intel ect and creativity were prerequisites for being part of the Vitale Society, he might as Wellgive up now. Rubbing the back of his neck, he glanced around at his fel ow pledges. It was reassuring to see that most of them were wearing expressions of barely restrained panic: apparently \"encompassing al these attributes\" wasn\u0027t something they\u0027d reckoned on either. Chloe, the cute round-faced girl he\u0027d noticed at the first gathering, caught his eye and winked, just a quick brush of her lashes, and he smiled back, feeling oddly happy. \"Today,\" Ethan announced, \"we wil work on athleticism.\" Matt sighed with relief. Athleticism he could do. Al around him, he saw faces fal . The intel ectuals, the leaders, the budding creative geniuses - they weren\u0027t looking forward to testing their athletic prowess. A low rebel ious murmur sWelled among them. \"Don\u0027t sulk,\" said Ethan, laughing. \"I promise you, by the time you become ful members of the society, each of you wil have reached your peak of physical perfection. For the first time, you wil feel what it is to be truly alive.\" His eyes glittered with possibility. Ethan went on to outline the pledges\u0027 task. They were about to embark on a fifteen-mile run, with several obstacles along the way. \"Be prepared to get dirty,\" he said cheerful y. \"But it wil be wonderful. When you finish, you\u0027l have achieved something new. You are welcome to assist one another. But be aware: if you do not complete the run in three hours, you wil not be invited to continue to the next step in the pledging process.\" He smiled. \"Only the best can become members of the Vitale Society.\" Matt looked around and saw that the pledges, even those who looked like they had never left the science lab or the library, were retying their sneakers and stretching, wearing determined expressions. \"Holy cow,\" a voice beside him said. It was a nice voice, with a real twang to it, a voice that came from somewhere deeper in the South than Virginia, and Matt was smiling even before he looked around and saw that it was Chloe. \"I figure you\u0027re about the only person here who isn\u0027t going to have a lot of trouble with this,\" she said. She was so cute. Little dimples showed in her cheeks when she smiled, and her short dark hair fel in curls behind her ears. \"Hey, I\u0027m Matt,\" Matt said, grinning back at her. \"I knew that,\" she said cheerful y. \"You\u0027re our footbal star.\" \"And you\u0027re Chloe, the amazing artist,\" he said. \"Oh.\" She blushed. \"I don\u0027t know about that.\" \"I\u0027d love to see your work sometime,\" he told her, and her smile widened. \"Any tips for today?\" she asked. \"I never run unless I\u0027m about to miss the bus, and I think I\u0027m about to regret that.\" Her face was so appealing that Matt momentarily felt like hugging her. Instead, he frowned thoughtful y up at the sky. \"Under these kinds of conditions,\" he said, \"the best thing to do is incline your arms at a fifty-degree angle to the ground and run with a light bounding step.\" Chloe stared at him for a minute and then giggled. \"You\u0027re teasing me,\" she said. \"That\u0027s not fair. I have no idea about this stuff.\" \"I\u0027l help you,\" Matt said, feeling good. \"We can do it together.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hunters-moonsong-the-vampire-diaries-2/page-8.html","bookId":2067,"book":{"id":2067,"title":"The Hunters: Moonsong (The Vampire Diaries #2)","description":"Storyline: Moonsong (The Vampire Diaries: The Hunters, #2) After escaping the horrors of the Dark Dimension, Elena and her friends can\u0027t wait to attend Dalcrest College, the beautiful ivy-covered campus where Elena\u0027s parents met.
