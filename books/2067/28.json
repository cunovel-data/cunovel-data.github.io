She\u0027l come back to you, and she\u0027l listen to you, once she gets a chance to cool down.\" His voice was deep and loving, and Meredith squeezed her eyes shut and held the phone more tightly to her ear, picturing his grad-student apartment with the cozy brown couch and the milk-crate bookshelves. She had never wished so hard that she was there.\n \"What if something happens to her, though?\" Meredith said. \"I can\u0027t wait around for Bonnie to get over being mad at me if she\u0027s in danger.\"\n Alaric made a thinking noise into the phone, and Meredith could picture his forehead scrunching in that cute way it did when he was analyzing a problem from different angles.\n \"Well,\" he said at last, \"Bonnie\u0027s been spending a lot of time with Zander, right? A lot of time alone? And she\u0027s been fine thus far. I think we can conclude that, even if Zander is the one behind the attacks on campus, he\u0027s not planning to hurt Bonnie.\"\n \"I think your reasoning is sort of specious there,\" Meredith said, feeling oddly comforted by his words nevertheless.\n Alaric gave a smal huff of surprised laughter. \"Don\u0027t cal my bluff,\" he said. \"I have a reputation for being logical.\" Meredith heard the creak of Alaric\u0027s desk chair on the other end of the line and imagined him leaning back, phone tucked into his shoulder, hands behind his head. \"I\u0027m so sorry about Samantha,\" he said, voice sobering.\n Meredith nestled farther into her bed, pressing her face against the pil ow. \"I can\u0027t talk about it yet,\" she said, closing her eyes. \"I just have to figure out who kil ed her.\"\n \"I don\u0027t know if this is going to be useful,\" Alaric said,\n \"but I\u0027ve been doing some research on the history of Dalcrest.\"\n \"Like the ghosts and weird mysteries around campus Elena\u0027s professor was talking about in class?\"\n \"Well, there\u0027s even more to the history of the col ege than he told them about,\" Alaric said. Meredith could hear him shuffling papers, probably flicking through the pages of one of his research notebooks. \"Dalcrest appears to be something of a paranormal hotspot. There have been incidents that sound like vampire and werewolf attacks throughout its history, and this isn\u0027t the first time there\u0027s been a string of mysterious disappearances on campus.\"\n \"Real y?\" Meredith sat up. \"How can the col ege stay open if people disappear al the time?\"\n \"It\u0027s not al the time,\" Alaric replied. \"The last major wave of disappearances was during the Second World War.\n There was a lot of population mobility at the time, and, although the missing students left worried friends and family behind, the police assumed that the young men who disappeared had run off to enlist and the young women to marry soldiers or to work in munitions factories. The fact that the students never turned up again seems to have been disregarded, and the cases weren\u0027t viewed as related.\"\n \"Super work on the police department\u0027s part,\" Meredith said acidly.\n \"There\u0027s a lot of weird behavior on campus, too,\" Alaric said. \"Sororities in the seventies practicing black magic, that kind of thing.\"\n \"Any of those sororities stil around?\" Meredith asked.\n \"Not those specific ones,\" Alaric said, \"but it\u0027s something to keep in mind. There might be something about the campus that makes people more likely to experiment with the supernatural.\"\n \"And what is that?\" Meredith asked, flopping down on her back again. \"What\u0027s your theory, Professor?\"\n \"Well, it\u0027s not my theory,\" Alaric said, \"but I found someone online who suggested that Dalcrest may be somewhere with a huge concentration of crossing ley lines, the same way that Fel \u0027s Church is. This whole part of Virginia has a lot of supernatural power, but some parts even more than others.\"\n Meredith frowned. Ley lines, the strong lines of Power running beneath the surface of the earth, shone like beacons to the supernatural world.\n \"And some people theorize that, where there are ley lines, the barriers between our world and the Dark Dimensions are thinner,\" Alaric continued. Wincing, Meredith remembered the creatures she, Bonnie, and Elena had faced in the Dark Dimension. If they were able to cross over, to come to Dalcrest as the kitsune had come to Fel \u0027s Church, everyone was in danger.\n \"We don\u0027t have any proof of that, though,\" Alaric said reassuringly, hurrying to fil up the silence between them.\n \"Al we know is that Dalcrest has a history of supernatural activity. We don\u0027t even know for sure if that\u0027s what we\u0027re facing now.\"\n An image of Samantha\u0027s blank dead eyes fil ed Meredith\u0027s mind. There had been a smear of blood across her cheek below her right eye. The murder scene had been so gruesome, and Samantha had been kil ed so horrifical y.\n Meredith believed in her heart of hearts that Alaric\u0027s theories must be correct: there was no way Samantha had been murdered by a human being. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hunters-moonsong-the-vampire-diaries-2/page-28.html","bookId":2067,"book":{"id":2067,"title":"The Hunters: Moonsong (The Vampire Diaries #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Moonsong (The Vampire Diaries: The Hunters, #2) \n After escaping the horrors of the Dark Dimension, Elena and her friends can\u0027t wait to attend Dalcrest College, the beautiful ivy-covered campus where Elena\u0027s parents met.
