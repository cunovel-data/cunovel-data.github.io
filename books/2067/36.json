{"id":111163,"no":36,"title":"Page 36","content":"When he opened his door and saw Elena, James\u0027s face crumpled, just for a fraction of a second, and he stepped backward, as if he was considering closing the door in her face. Then he seemed to think better of it, and he opened it wider, his face creasing into its familiar smile. \"Why, Elena,\" he said, \"My dear, I hardly expected a visitor at this hour. I\u0027m afraid this isn\u0027t the best time.\" He cleared his throat. \"I\u0027d be delighted to see you at school, during office hours. Mondays and Fridays, remember? Now, if you\u0027l excuse me.\" And, stil smiling gently, he shuffled forward and did try to close the door in her face. But Elena swung her hand up and stopped him. \"Wait,\" she said. \"James, I know you didn\u0027t want to talk to me about the pins, but it\u0027s important. I need to find out more about the Vitale Society.\" His bright black eyes glanced toward her and away, as if embarrassed. \"Yes, Well,\" he said, \"the problem is of course that unchaperoned solo visits from a student - any student, you understand, my dear, no reflection on you personal y - to a professor\u0027s home are, er, frowned upon. The wicked world we live in, you know,\" and, with a soft chuckle, he pushed firmly against the door. \"There are times and places.\" Elena pushed back. \"I don\u0027t believe for a minute that you\u0027re trying to make me go away because my visit is inappropriate,\" she said flatly. \"You can\u0027t get rid of me that easily. People are in danger, James. \"I know you and my parents were part of the Vitale Society,\" Elena continued doggedly. \"I need you to tel me whatever it is that you\u0027ve been hiding about those days. I think the Vitale is tied to the murders and disappearances on campus, and we have to stop it. You\u0027re my only lead at this point, James.\" He hesitated, his eyes watering with emotion, and Elena fixed him with her gaze. \"More people are going to die,\" she said harshly, \"but you might be able to save them. Wil you?\" James visibly wavered and then seemed to give in al at once, his shoulders dropping. \"I don\u0027t know if anything I can tel you wil help. I don\u0027t know anything about the murders. But you\u0027d better come in,\" he said, and led the way down the hal and through his house. The kitchen was shining clean, with spotless white surfaces. Copper pots, woven baskets, and cheery red dishcloths and towels hung from hooks and were arranged on top of cupboards. Framed prints of fruits and vegetables hung on the wal s at intervals. James sat her down at the table, then busied himself with making her a cup of tea. Elena waited patiently until he final y settled across from her, with cups of tea in front of them both. \"Milk?\" he asked fussily, handing her the jug, without meeting her eyes. \"Sugar?\" \"Thank you,\" Elena said. Then she leaned across the table and placed her hand on his, keeping it there until he raised his eyes to look at her. \"Tel me,\" she said simply. \"I don\u0027t know anything about the murders,\" James said again. \"Believe me, I wouldn\u0027t have kept this secret if I thought anyone was in danger from it.\" Elena nodded. \"I know you wouldn\u0027t,\" she said. \"Even if there isn\u0027t a connection, if the secret is about my parents, I deserve to know,\" she told him. James sighed, a long breathy sound. \"This was al a long time ago, you understand,\" he said. \"We were young and a bit naive. The Vitale Society was a force for good, back then. We worshipped natural spirits and drew our energy from the sacred Earth. We were a positive force in the community, interested principal y in love and peace and creativity. We served others. I hear that the Vitale Society has changed since those days, that darker elements have taken it over. But I don\u0027t know much about them now. I haven\u0027t been involved with the Vitale for years, not since the events I am about to recount to you.\" Elena sipped her tea and waited. James\u0027s eyes flew to her face, almost shyly, then fixed back on the table. \"One day,\" he said slowly, \"a strange man came to one of our secret meetings. He was - \" James closed his eyes and shivered. \"I had never seen a being of such pure power, or one who radiated such a feeling of peace and love. We, al of us, had no doubt that we were in the presence of an angel. He cal ed himself a Guardian.\" Involuntarily, Elena sucked a breath through her teeth, hissing. James\u0027s eyes snapped open, and he gave her a long look. \"You know them?\" At her nod, he shrugged a little. \"Well, you can imagine how he affected us.\" \"What did the Guardian want?\" Elena asked, her stomach dropping. She had met Guardians, and she hadn\u0027t liked them. It was Guardians who had, coldly and efficiently, refused to bring Damon back to life when he had died in the Dark Dimension. And it was Guardians who had caused the car accident that kil ed her parents in an attempt to kil Elena so that they could recruit her to their ranks. Al the Guardians she\u0027d met were female, though; she hadn\u0027t even known there were male Guardians as Well. Elena knew that, lovely as the Guardians appeared to be, they were not angels, were not on the side of Good or, for that matter, the side of Evil. They just believed in Order. They could be very dangerous. James looked at her briefly, then fiddled with the tea cup and napkin in front of him. \"Would you like a scone?\" he asked. She shook her head and stared at him, and he sighed again. \"You have to understand that your parents were very young. Idealistic.\" Elena had the sinking feeling that she was going to find out something deeply unpleasant. \"Go on,\" she said. Instead of continuing, though, James folded his napkin into tiny, precise squares, smal er and smal er, until Elena cleared her throat. Then he began again. \"The Guardian told us that there was a need for a new kind of Guardian. One who would be a mortal, on Earth, and who would possess special powers that she would need to maintain the balance between good and evil supernatural forces on Earth. Over the course of his visit, Elizabeth and Thomas, who were young and bril iant and good and deeply in love, and who had bright futures ahead of them, were chosen to be the parents of this mortal Guardian.\" He let the napkin unfold itself in his hands and looked at Elena meaningful y. It took her a moment to catch on. \"Me? Are you kidding? I\u0027m not - \" She shut her mouth. \"I have enough problems,\" she said flatly. She paused as something he said sank in. \"Wait, why do you think my parents were being naive?\" she asked sharply. \"What did they do?\" James drank a swal ow of tea. \"Frankly, I think I need a little something in this before I continue,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve kept this secret for a long time, and I stil have to tel you the worst part.\" He got up and rummaged around in one of the cupboards, eventual y pul ing out a smal bottle ful of amber liquid. He held it out to Elena questioningly, but she shook her head. She was pretty certain she would need her head clear for the rest of this conversation. He poured a generous amount into his own cup. \"So,\" he said, sitting down again. Elena could tel that he was stil anxious, but also that he was beginning to enjoy tel ing the story. He was a natural gossip - the way he taught history was as gossip about the past - and this was even more familiar for him, because it was gossip about Elena\u0027s parents, people they both had known. \"Thomas and Elizabeth were both terrifical y flattered, of course.\" \"And...\" Elena prompted. James laced his fingers across his stomach and watched her, his eyes shadowed. \"They agreed that, when the child was twelve years old, they would give her up. The Guardians would take her away, and they would never see her again.\" Elena was suddenly very cold. Her parents had raised her intending to give her away? She felt like al her childhood memories were shattering. In an instant, James was at her side. \"Breathe,\" he said gently. Gasping, Elena shut her eyes and concentrated on inhaling and exhaling deep breaths. That her parents, her beloved parents, had taken her on as some kind of temporary project, was devastating. She had never doubted their love until now. She had to know the whole truth. \"Go on.\" \"Honestly, that was the end of my friendship with your parents, and the end of my involvement with the Vitale Society,\" James said, taking another long drink of his whiskey-laced tea. \"I couldn\u0027t believe that no one else in the Society saw the problem with raising a child to the cusp of adolescence and then giving her up forever, and I couldn\u0027t believe that your parents - who I knew to be loving, intel igent people - would agree to such a plan. We graduated and went our separate ways, and I didn\u0027t hear from your parents again for more than twelve years.\" \"You heard from them then?\" Elena asked quietly. \"Your father cal ed me. The Guardians had contacted them, ready to take you away. But Thomas and Elizabeth wouldn\u0027t let you go.\" James smiled sadly. \"They loved you too much. They didn\u0027t think you were ready to leave home - you were only a child. They realized that they had agreed too quickly to the Guardians\u0027 plan, that they didn\u0027t real y know what was in store for you, and that they couldn\u0027t let their daughter go without knowing for certain that it was the best thing for her. So Thomas asked for my help protecting you. They knew I had dabbled in sorcery when I was in col ege\" - he waved his hand modestly when Elena looked up at him - \"only smal magics, and I had mostly given them up by then. But he and Elizabeth were desperate. So I gathered what knowledge I could, intending to help them.\" He paused, and a gloom settled over his face. \"Unfortunately, I was too late. A few days after our conversation, before I even set out for Fel \u0027s Church, your parents were both kil ed in a car accident. I checked up on you over the years, but it didn\u0027t seem like the Guardians had gotten their hands on you. And now, here you are. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a coincidence.\" \"The Guardians kil ed my parents,\" Elena said dul y. \"I knew it, but I didn\u0027t know... I thought it was an accident.\" She was struggling to wrap her mind around the secrets of her childhood. At least in the end her parents hadn\u0027t been able to give her away. They had loved her, as she had thought. \"They tend to get what they want,\" James said. \"Why didn\u0027t they take me then?\" Elena asked. James shook his head. \"I don\u0027t know. But I think there\u0027s a reason you\u0027re at Dalcrest now, where it began for you and for your parents. I think that some kind of task wil arise here, and you\u0027l come into your Powers.\" \"A task?\" Elena asked. \"But I had Powers once, and the Guardians took them away.\" They had mercilessly stripped her of her Wings and al her abilities. Were they going to return them when the time was right? James sighed and shrugged helplessly. \"Plans sometimes have curious ways of presenting themselves, even those that are fated from the start,\" he said. \"Maybe these disappearances are the first sign of it. I don\u0027t know, though. As I told the class, Dalcrest is the hub of a lot of paranormal activity. I tend to think that, when your task presents itself, you\u0027l know.\" \"But I\u0027m not...\" Elena gulped. \"I don\u0027t understand what this al means. I just want to be a normal girl. I thought I could now. Here.\" James reached across the table and patted her hand, his eyes deep Wells of sympathy. \"I\u0027m so sorry, my dear,\" he said. \"I didn\u0027t want to be the one to burden you with this. But I wil give you any help I can. Thomas and Elizabeth would have wanted that.\" Elena felt like she couldn\u0027t breathe. She had to get out of this cozy kitchen, away from James\u0027s avid, concerned eyes. \"Thank you,\" she said, hurriedly pushing her chair away from the table and getting up. \"I have to go now, though. I do appreciate your tel ing me al this, but I need to think.\" He fussed around her al the way to the front door, clearly unsure of whether to let her go, and Elena was almost ready to scream by the time she reached the porch. \"Thank you,\" she said again. \"Good-bye.\" She walked quickly away without looking back, her shoes clacking against the cement of the sidewalk. When she was out of sight of James\u0027s house, Damon slipped from the shadows to join her. Elena held her head high, blinking away the tears that had pooled in her eyes. For now, this secret would be hers.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hunters-moonsong-the-vampire-diaries-2/page-36.html","bookId":2067,"book":{"id":2067,"title":"The Hunters: Moonsong (The Vampire Diaries #2)","description":"Storyline: Moonsong (The Vampire Diaries: The Hunters, #2) After escaping the horrors of the Dark Dimension, Elena and her friends can\u0027t wait to attend Dalcrest College, the beautiful ivy-covered campus where Elena\u0027s parents met.
