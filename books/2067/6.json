{"id":111135,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"Cautiously, Matt felt along the path with his foot until he found grass, then inched his way onto it, holding his hands out in front of him until he was touching the rough bark of a tree. There probably weren\u0027t too many people hanging around outside the main campus gate, but he\u0027d just as soon have no one see him, blindfolded, dressed in his weddings-and-funerals suit and tie, and looking, he was sure, like an idiot. On the other hand, he did want whoever was coming to get him to be able to spot him. It would be better to look like an idiot out in the open now and become part of the Vitale Society than to hide and spend the rest of the night blindfolded in the bushes. Matt inched his way back toward where he thought the gate must be and stumbled. Waving his hands, he managed to catch his balance again. He suddenly wished he had told someone where he was going. What if somebody other than the Vitale Society had left him the note? What if this was a plan to get him on his own, some kind of trap? Matt ran his finger beneath his sweaty too-tight col ar. After al the weird things that had happened to him in the last year, he couldn\u0027t help being paranoid. If he vanished now, his friends would never know what had happened to him. He thought of Elena\u0027s laughing blue eyes, her clear, searching gaze. She would miss him if he disappeared, he knew, even if she had never loved him the way he wanted her to. Bonnie\u0027s laugh would lose its carefree note if Matt were gone, and Meredith would become more tense and fierce, push herself harder. He mattered to them. The Vitale Society\u0027s invitation was clear, though: tel no one. If he wanted to get in the game, he had to play by their rules. Matt understood rules. Without warning, someone - two someones - grabbed his arms, one on each side. Instinctively, Matt struggled, and he heard a grunt of exasperation from the person on his right. \"Fortis aeturnus,\" hissed the person on his left like a password, his breath warm on Matt\u0027s ear. Matt stopped fighting. That was the slogan on the letter from the Vitale Society, wasn\u0027t it? It was Latin, he was pretty sure. He wished he\u0027d taken the time to find out what it meant. He let the people holding his arms guide him across the grass and onto the road. \"Step up,\" the one on his left whispered, and Matt moved forward careful y, climbing into what seemed to be the back of a van. Firm hands pushed his head down to keep him from banging it on the van\u0027s roof, and Matt was reminded of that terrible time this past summer when he\u0027d been arrested, accused of attacking Caroline. The cops had pushed his head down just like that when they put him handcuffed into the back of the squad car. His stomach sank with remembered dread, but he shook it off. The Guardians had erased everyone\u0027s memories of Caroline\u0027s false accusations, just as they\u0027d changed everything else. The hands guided him to a seat and strapped a seat belt around him. There seemed to be people sitting on each side of him, and Matt opened his mouth to speak - to say what, he didn\u0027t know. \"Be stil ,\" the mysterious voice whispered, and Matt closed his mouth obediently. He strained his eyes to see something past the blindfold, even a hint of light and shadow, but everything was dark. Footsteps clattered across the floor of the van; then the doors slammed, and the engine started up. Matt sat back. He tried to keep track of the turns the van took but lost count of the rights and lefts after a few minutes and instead just sat quietly, waiting to see what would happen next. After about fifteen minutes, the van came to a halt. The people on either side of Matt sat up straighter, and he tensed, too. He heard the front doors open and close and then footsteps come around the van before the back doors opened. \"Remain silent,\" the voice that spoke to him earlier ordered. \"You wil be guided toward the next stage of your journey.\" The person next to Matt brushed against him as he rose, and Matt heard him stumble on what sounded like gravel underfoot as he was led away. He listened alertly, but, once that person had left, Matt heard only the nervous shifting of the other people seated in the van. He jumped when hands took his arms once more. Somehow they\u0027d snuck up on him again; he hadn\u0027t heard a thing. The hands helped him out of the van, then guided him across what felt like a sidewalk or courtyard, where his shoes thudded against first gravel, then pavement. His guides continued to lead him up a series of stairs, through some kind of hal way, then back down again. Matt counted three flights down before he was stopped again. \"Wait here,\" the voice said, and then his guides stepped away. Matt tried to figure out where he was. He could hear people, probably his companions from the van, shifting quietly, but no one spoke. Judging by the echoes their little motions produced, they were in a large space: a gym? a basement? Probably a basement, after al those stairs down. From behind him came the quiet click of a door closing. \"You may now remove your blindfolds,\" a new voice, deep and confident, said. Matt untied his blindfold and looked around, blinking as his eyes adjusted to the light. It was a faint, indirect light, which supported his basement theory, but if this was a basement, it was the fanciest one he\u0027d ever seen. The room was huge, stretching into dimness at its other end, and the floor and wal s were paneled in a dark, heavy wood. Arches and pil ars supported the ceiling at intervals, and there were some kinds of carvings on them: the clever, twisted face of what might be a sprite leered at him from a pil ar; the figure of a running deer spanned one archway. Red-velvet-seated chairs and heavy wooden tables lined the wal s. Matt and the others were facing a great central archway, topped by a large ornate letter V made of different kinds of glittering, highly polished metals elaborately welded together. Below the V ran the same motto that had appeared on the letter: fortis aeturnus. Glancing at the people near him, Matt saw that he wasn\u0027t the only one feeling confused and apprehensive. There were maybe fifteen other people standing there, and they seemed like they came from different classes: there was no way that tal , stooping guy with the ful beard was a freshman. A smal , round-faced girl with short ringlets of brown hair caught Matt\u0027s eye. She raised her eyebrows at him, widening her mouth in an exaggerated expression of bewilderment. Matt grinned back at her, his spirits lightening. He shifted closer to her and had just opened his mouth to whisper an introduction when he was interrupted. \"Welcome,\" said the deep, authoritative voice that had instructed them to take off their blindfolds, and a young man stepped up to the central archway, directly below the huge V. Behind him came a circle of others, seemingly a mix of guys and girls, al clothed in black and wearing masks. The effect ought to have been over the top, Matt thought, but instead the masked figures seemed mysterious and aloof, and he suppressed a shiver. The guy beneath the arch was the only one not wearing a mask. He was a bit shorter than the silent figures around him, with curly dark hair, and he smiled warmly as he stretched out his hands toward Matt and the others. \"Welcome,\" he said again, \"to a secret. You may have heard rumors of the Vitale Society, the oldest and most il ustrious organization of Dalcrest. This is a society often spoken of in whispers, but about which no one knows the truth. No one except its members. I am Ethan Crane, the current president of the Vitale Society, and I\u0027m delighted that you have accepted our invitation.\" He paused and looked around. \"You have been invited to pledge because you are the best of the best. Each of you has different strengths.\" He gestured to the tal , bearded guy Matt had noticed. \"Stuart Covington here is the most bril iant scientific mind of the senior class, perhaps one of the most promising ones in the country. His articles on biogenetics have already been published in numerous journals.\" Ethan walked into the crowd and stopped next to Matt. This close up, Matt could see that Ethan\u0027s eyes were an almost golden hazel, ful of warmth. \"Matt Honeycutt enters Dalcrest as a starting player on the footbal team after leading his high school to the state championship last year. He could have had his choice of col ege footbal programs, and he chose to come to Dalcrest.\" Matt ducked his head modestly, and Ethan squeezed his shoulder before walking on to stop next to the cute round-faced girl. \"Junior Chloe Pascal is, as those of you who attended last year\u0027s campus art show know, the most talented artist on campus. Her dynamic, exciting sculptures have won her the Gershner Award for two years running.\" He patted Chloe on the arm as she blushed. Ethan went on, passing from one member of their little group to another, listing accomplishments. Matt was only half listening as he looked around at the rapt expressions on the faces of the other candidates, but he got the impression of a wide range of talents, and that this was indeed a gathering of the best of the best, an assembly of campus achievers. He seemed to be the only freshman. He felt like Ethan had lit a glowing candle inside him: he, Matt, who had been the least special of his group of friends, was being singled out. \"As you can see,\" Ethan said, circling back to the front of the group, \"each of you has different skil s. Brains, creativity, athleticism, the ability to lead others. These qualities, when brought together, can make you the most elite and powerful group, not only on campus, but throughout life. The Vitale Society is an organization with a long history, and once you are a member of the society, you are one for life. Forever.\" He held up one finger in caution, his face serious. \"However, this meeting is but the first step on the road to becoming a Vitale. And it is a difficult road.\" He smiled at them again. \"I believe - we believe - that al of you have what it takes to become a Vitale. You would not have been invited to pledge if we did not think you were worthy.\" Matt straightened his shoulders and held his head high. Least remarkable member of his group of friends or not, he\u0027d saved the world - or at least his hometown - more than once. Even if he\u0027d just been one of a team then, he was pretty sure he could handle whatever the Vitale Society could throw at him. Ethan smiled directly at him. \"If you are prepared to pledge the Vitale Society, to keep our secrets and earn our trust, step forward now.\" Without hesitating, Matt stepped forward. Chloe and the bearded guy - Stuart - stepped with him and, looking around, Matt saw that every one of the pledges had moved forward together. Ethan came toward Matt and took hold of the lapel of his suit. \"There,\" he said, quickly pinning something on it and letting Matt go. \"Wear this at al times, but discreetly. You must keep your involvement with the society secret. You wil be contacted. Congratulations.\" He gave Matt a brief, genuine smile, and moved on to Chloe, saying the same thing to her. Matt turned his lapel up and looked at the tiny dark blue V that Ethan had pinned to it. He\u0027d never thought much before about fraternities, or secret societies, or any kind of organization that wasn\u0027t a sports team. But this, being the only freshman the legendary Vitale Society wanted, was different. They saw something in him, something special.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hunters-moonsong-the-vampire-diaries-2/page-6.html","bookId":2067,"book":{"id":2067,"title":"The Hunters: Moonsong (The Vampire Diaries #2)","description":"Storyline: Moonsong (The Vampire Diaries: The Hunters, #2) After escaping the horrors of the Dark Dimension, Elena and her friends can\u0027t wait to attend Dalcrest College, the beautiful ivy-covered campus where Elena\u0027s parents met.
