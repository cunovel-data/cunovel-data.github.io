{"id":111164,"no":37,"title":"Page 37","content":"Ethan had Chloe, was holding her tightly in his arms like a parody of a lover\u0027s embrace. Matt moaned deep in his throat and strained toward her, but he couldn\u0027t move, couldn\u0027t even open his mouth to shout. Chloe\u0027s large brown eyes were fixed on his, and they were fil ed with terror. As Ethan bent his head to her neck, Matt held her gaze and tried to send Chloe a comforting message with his eyes.\\n\\n It\u0027s okay, Chloe, he thought. Please, it won\u0027t hurt for long. Be strong. Chloe whimpered, frozen, her eyes on Matt\u0027s as if his steady gaze was the only thing keeping her from fal ing to pieces.\\n\\n Keeping his eyes on hers and his breathing slow, Matt tried to emanate calmness, tried to soothe Chloe, as his mind worked frantical y. Including Ethan, there were fifteen Vitales. Al of them vampires. The other Vitales were watching quietly from behind the altar, letting Ethan take the lead and sire the pledges.\\n\\n The bodies of four of the pledges lay at Ethan\u0027s feet now. They\u0027d be out of the picture for several hours at least, their bodies going through the transition that would take them from corpses to vampires. Including Matt and Chloe, there were six pledges left. The longer Matt waited to fight back, the worse the odds would get.\\n\\n But what could Matt do? If only he could break this involuntary stil ness, if only he weren\u0027t a helpless prisoner.\\n\\n He tried again to move, this time focusing al his strength on lifting his right arm. His muscles tensed with effort, but after about thirty seconds of trying, he stopped in disgust. He was exhausting himself, and he wasn\u0027t moving an inch.\\n\\n Whatever held him was strong.\\n\\n But if he could figure out a way to get free, then he\u0027d be able to grab a torch from the wal , maybe. Beneath his robe, his pocket knife weighed heavily in his pants pocket.\\n\\n Vampires burned. Cutting off their heads would kil them. If he could just hold the vampires off long enough to pul Chloe and whichever other pledges he could grab out of the room, then he could come back later with reinforcements and fight them with a chance at winning.\\n\\n But if he couldn\u0027t break this spel or compulsion that was holding him in place, any plan he came up with would be useless.\\n\\n Ethan raised his head from Chloe\u0027s neck, his long sharp teeth pul ing out of her throat, and licked gently at the red blood trickling from the wound in her neck. \"I know, sweetheart,\" he murmured, \"but it\u0027s only for a moment. And then we\u0027l live forever.\" Chloe\u0027s eyes glazed over and fluttered shut, but she was stil breathing, stil alive. There was stil a chance for her.\\n\\n At Ethan\u0027s feet, Anna stirred and moaned. As Matt watched in horror, her eyes snapped open, and she looked up at Ethan, her expression confused but adoring.\\n\\n No! Matt thought. It\u0027s too soon!\\n\\n As if he had caught the thought, Ethan turned to Matt and winked. \"The herbs in the mixture you al drank worked to thin your blood and speed up your metabolism,\" he said, his voice as casual and friendly as if they were chatting in the cafeteria. \"I wasn\u0027t sure if it would work, but it looks like it does. Makes the transition go a lot faster.\" His smile widened. \"I\u0027m a biochem major, you know.\" Ethan\u0027s mouth was smeared with blood, and Matt shuddered but couldn\u0027t look away from the golden eyes that held his.\\n\\n It\u0027s possible, Matt thought for the first time, that I might not survive this. His stomach rol ed with nausea. He real y didn\u0027t want to become a vampire.\\n\\n If the newly transformed pledges were waking up so soon, the already slim odds would quickly become impossible. New vampires, he remembered from Elena\u0027s transformation back in the winter, awoke vicious, unreasoning, hungry, and fanatical y committed to the vampire who had changed them.\\n\\n Ethan lowered his head to bite at Chloe\u0027s neck again, as Anna climbed to her feet with a fluid, inhuman grace. On the other side of the altar, Stuart was now beginning to stir, one long leg shifting restlessly against the dark wood of the floor.\\n\\n His throat burning with unvoiced sobs of frustration, Matt felt his last flame of hope begin to flicker and die. There was no escape.\\n\\n Suddenly, the door at the far end of the chamber burst inward, and Stefan swept in.\\n\\n Ethan looked up in surprise, but before he or the other vampires could move, Stefan flew across the chamber and ripped Chloe from Ethan\u0027s arms. She fel flat in front of the altar, blood running down her neck. Matt couldn\u0027t tel if she was stil breathing, stil clinging to life as a human, or not.\\n\\n Stefan grabbed Ethan by his long robe and slammed him against the wal . He shook the curly-haired vampire as easily as a dog might shake a rat.\\n\\n For a moment, the terrible fear that held Matt in its grip loosened. Stefan knew what was happening, Stefan had found him. Stefan would save them al .\\n\\n The other Vitales were racing toward Stefan now as he struggled with Ethan, their long robes flowing behind them as they smoothly came forward, moving as one.\\n\\n Stefan was without a doubt much stronger than any of them. He flung a black-clad female vampire - the one who had handed him the goblet, Matt thought - away from him easily, and she sailed across the chamber as if she was no heavier than a rag dol , landing in a crumpled heap against the opposite wal . Smiling viciously, Stefan tore at the throat of another with his teeth, and she fel to the ground and lay stil .\\n\\n But there were so many of them, and only one of Stefan.\\n\\n After just a few minutes of watching the fight, Matt could see that it was hopeless, and his heart sank. Stefan was much older, and much stronger, than any other vampire in the room, but together they outweighed him. The tide of the battle was turning, and they were overwhelming him through the sheer strength of their numbers. Ethan was free of him now, straightening his robes, and four of the Vitale vampires, working together, pinned Stefan\u0027s arms behind him. Anna, her eyes shining, snapped at him viciously.\\n\\n Ethan grabbed a torch from the wal behind him and eyed Stefan speculatively, absently licking at the blood on the back of his hand. \"You had your chance, Stefan,\" he said, smiling.\\n\\n Stefan stopped struggling and hung limp between the vampires holding his arms. \"Wait,\" he said, looking up at Ethan. \"You wanted me to join you. You begged me to join you. Do you stil want me?\"\\n\\n Ethan tilted his head thoughtful y, his golden eyes bright.\\n\\n \"I do,\" he said. \"But what can you tel me that\u0027l make me believe you want to join us?\"\\n\\n Stefan licked his lips. \"Let Matt go. If you let him leave safely, I\u0027l stay in his place.\" He paused. \"On my honor.\"\\n\\n \"Done,\" Ethan said immediately. He flicked his fingers in the air without taking his eyes from Stefan, and Matt staggered, suddenly released from the compulsion that had held him in place.\\n\\n Matt sucked in one long breath and then ran straight for the altar and Chloe. Maybe it wasn\u0027t too late. He could stil save her.\\n\\n \"Stop.\" Ethan\u0027s voice cracked commandingly across the room. Matt froze in place, once again unable to move.\\n\\n Ethan glared at him. \"You do not help. You do not fight,\" he said coldly. \"You go.\"\\n\\n Matt looked imploringly at Stefan. Surely he wasn\u0027t just supposed to leave, to abandon Chloe and Stefan and the others to the Vitale vampires. Stefan gazed back at him, his features rigid. \"Sorry, Matt,\" he said flatly. \"The one thing I\u0027ve learned over the years is that sometimes you have to surrender. The best thing you can do now is just leave. I\u0027l be okay.\"\\n\\n And then, jarringly intrusive and sudden in Matt\u0027s head was Stefan\u0027s voice. Damon, he said fiercely. Get Damon.\\n\\n Matt gulped and, as Ethan\u0027s compulsion released him once more, nodded slowly, trying to look defeated while stil signaling to Stefan with his eyes that his message had been received.\\n\\n He couldn\u0027t look at the other pledges. No matter how much he hurried, some or al of them would die before he returned. Maybe Stefan would be able to save some of them. Maybe. Maybe he would be able to save Chloe.\\n\\n His heart pounding with terror, his head spinning with fear, Matt ran for the exit and for help. He didn\u0027t look back. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hunters-moonsong-the-vampire-diaries-2/page-37.html","bookId":2067,"book":{"id":2067,"title":"The Hunters: Moonsong (The Vampire Diaries #2)","description":"Storyline: Moonsong (The Vampire Diaries: The Hunters, #2) \\n After escaping the horrors of the Dark Dimension, Elena and her friends can\u0027t wait to attend Dalcrest College, the beautiful ivy-covered campus where Elena\u0027s parents met.
