{"id":111165,"no":38,"title":"Page 38","content":"Bonnie didn\u0027t have her keys. She knew exactly where they were, but that didn\u0027t do her much good: they were lying on the bedside table next to Zander\u0027s neat plain single bed. She cursed and kicked at the door, tears running down her face. How was she going to get any of her stuff back? Some guy opened the front door of the building for her. \"Jeez, relax,\" he said, but Bonnie had already pushed past him and was running up the stairs to her room. Please let them be here, she thought, clinging to the banister, please. She had no doubt that Elena and Meredith would comfort her, would help her, no matter what she had said to them during their fight. They would help Bonnie figure out what to do. But they might be out. And she\u0027d have no idea where to find Meredith and Elena, no idea where they spent their free time these days. How had she grown so far apart from her best friends? Bonnie wondered, wiping her hands across her cheeks, smearing away her tears and snot. Why had she treated them so badly? They were just trying to protect her. And they were right about Zander; they were so right. She snuffled miserably. When she reached the top of the stairs, Bonnie banged on their room door with her fist, hearing quick movement inside. They were home. Thank God. \"Bonnie?\" Meredith said, startled, when she opened the door, and then, \"Oh, Bonnie,\" as Bonnie threw herself, sobbing, into Meredith\u0027s arms. Meredith hugged her, tight and fierce, and, for the first time since she had jumped away from Zander and run for the fire escape, Bonnie felt safe. \"What\u0027s the matter, Bonnie? What happened?\" Elena was behind Meredith, peering at her anxiously, and part of Bonnie noticed that Elena\u0027s own white and startled face was marked with tears. She was interrupting something, but Bonnie couldn\u0027t focus on that now. Past Elena, she caught sight of herself in the mirror. Her hair stood out around her face in a wild red cloud, her eyes were glassy, and her pale face was smeared with dirt and tears. I look, Bonnie thought with a semihysterical silent laugh, like I was chased by werewolves. \"Werewolves,\" she wailed as Meredith pul ed her into the room. \"They\u0027re al werewolves.\" \"What are you - \" Meredith broke off. \"Bonnie, do you mean Zander and his friends? They\u0027re werewolves?\" Bonnie nodded furiously, burying her face against Meredith\u0027s shoulder. Meredith pushed her back and looked careful y into her eyes. \"Are you sure, Bonnie?\" she asked gently. She looked to Elena, and they both turned and glanced out the window at the sky. \"Did you see them change? It\u0027s not the ful moon yet.\" \"No,\" Bonnie said. She tried to catch her breath, taking harsh sobbing gulps of air. \"Zander told me. And then - oh, Meredith, it was so scary - I ran, and they chased me.\" She explained what happened, on the roof and on the lawns of the col ege. Meredith and Elena looked at each other quizzical y, then back at Bonnie. \"Why did he tel you?\" Elena asked. \"He couldn\u0027t have thought you would have a good reaction to the news; it would have been easier to keep hiding it.\" Bonnie shook her head helplessly. Meredith arched an ironic eyebrow at her. \"Even monsters can fal in love,\" she said. \"I thought you knew that, Elena.\" She glanced at her hunting stave, leaning against the foot of her bed. \"When the ful moon comes, now I\u0027l know what to look for.\" Bonnie stared at her in horror. \"You\u0027re not going to hunt them, are you?\" It was a stupid question, she knew. If Zander and his friends real y were behind the murders and disappearances on campus, Meredith had to hunt them. It was her responsibility. Al of their responsibilities, real y, because if they were the only ones who knew the truth, they were the only ones who could keep everyone else safe. But Zander, something inside her howled in pain. Not Zander... \"None of the attacks occurred during a ful moon,\" Elena said thoughtful y, and Meredith and Bonnie both blinked at her. \"That\u0027s true,\" Meredith agreed, frowning as she thought back. \"I don\u0027t know how we didn\u0027t realize that before. Bonnie,\" she said. \"Think careful y before you answer this question. You\u0027ve been spending a lot of time with Zander and his friends. Did anything about them make you think they might hurt someone, real y hurt them, when they\u0027re not in wolf form?\" \"No!\" Bonnie said automatical y. Then she stopped and thought and said, more slowly, \"No, I don\u0027t think so. Zander\u0027s real y kind, I don\u0027t think he could fake that. Not al the time. They play rough, but I\u0027ve never seen them fight with anyone except one another. And even with one another, they\u0027re not real y fighting, just more sort of messing around.\" \"We know what you mean,\" Meredith said dryly. \"We\u0027ve seen it.\" Elena tucked a lock of hair behind her ear. \"The disappearances weren\u0027t during the ful moon, either,\" she said thoughtful y. \"Although I guess they could have been taking people and holding them prisoner, planning to kil them when they were in wolf form later, but that doesn\u0027t - I mean, I don\u0027t have much werewolf experience besides Tyler, but - it doesn\u0027t sound very wolfy to me. Too sterile, sort of.\" \"But...\" Bonnie sank down on her bed. \"You think there\u0027s a chance Zander and his friends might not be the kil ers? Then who are the kil ers?\" She felt bewildered. Meredith and Elena exchanged a grim glance. \"You wouldn\u0027t believe some of the stuff that happens on this campus,\" Elena said. \"We\u0027l fil you in.\" Bonnie rubbed her face with her hands. \"Zander told me he was a good werewolf,\" she said. \"That he didn\u0027t hurt people. Is that possible? Is there even such a thing as a good werewolf?\" Meredith and Elena sat down next to her, one on each side, and wrapped their arms around her. \"Maybe?\" Elena said. \"I real y hope so, Bonnie. For your sake.\" Bonnie sighed and cuddled closer to them, resting her head on Meredith\u0027s shoulder. \"I need to think about al this,\" she said. \"At least I\u0027m not alone. I\u0027m so glad I have you guys. I\u0027m sorry we fought.\" Elena and Meredith both hugged her more tightly. \"You\u0027ve always got us,\" Elena promised. A wild hammering came at the door. Elena glanced at Bonnie, who tensed visibly on her bed but kept her hands over her face, and then at Meredith, who nodded firmly to her and climbed to her feet, reaching for her stave. It had occurred to both of them that, if Zander wanted to talk to Bonnie, he knew exactly where she lived. Elena flung open the door, and Matt tumbled in. He was wearing a long black hooded robe, and his eyes were frantic as he gasped for breath. \"Matt?\" she said in surprise, and looked to Meredith, who gave a tiny shrug and put her stave back down. \"What\u0027s the matter? And what are you wearing?\" He grabbed Elena by the shoulders, holding her too tightly. \"Stefan\u0027s in danger,\" he said, and she froze. \"The Vitale Society - they\u0027re vampires. Stefan saved me, but he can\u0027t fight them al .\" He quickly explained what happened in the secret chamber below the library, how Stefan came to his rescue, then sent him to get help. \"We don\u0027t have much time,\" he finished. \"They\u0027re kil ing - they\u0027re changing al the pledges into vampires. I don\u0027t even know what Ethan\u0027s got planned for Stefan. We have to go back. And we need Damon.\" Meredith picked up her stave again and, grim faced, was taking her satchel of weapons from her closet. Bonnie was on her feet, too, fists clenched, jaw firm. \"I\u0027l cal Damon,\" Elena said, picking up her phone. Damon had dropped her off at the dorm after walking her back from James\u0027s house, but he was probably stil nearby. Stefan in danger. If he ... if anything happened to him, if something happened while they were apart, while he was stil hurt and it was her fault, Elena would never forgive herself. She wouldn\u0027t deserve to be forgiven. Guilt was like a knife in her stomach. How could she have hurt Stefan like that? She was attracted to Damon, sure, even loved him, but she\u0027d never had any question that Stefan was her true love. And she had broken his heart. She\u0027d do anything to save Stefan. She\u0027d die for him if she had to. And, as she listened to the ringing on the other end of the line and waited for Damon to pick up, she realized that there was no question in her mind that Damon would do anything to save Stefan, too.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hunters-moonsong-the-vampire-diaries-2/page-38.html","bookId":2067,"book":{"id":2067,"title":"The Hunters: Moonsong (The Vampire Diaries #2)","description":"Storyline: Moonsong (The Vampire Diaries: The Hunters, #2) After escaping the horrors of the Dark Dimension, Elena and her friends can\u0027t wait to attend Dalcrest College, the beautiful ivy-covered campus where Elena\u0027s parents met.
