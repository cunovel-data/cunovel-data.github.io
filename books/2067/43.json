Gingerly, he patted himself down, finding that he was sticky with half-dried blood, covered with a score of smal injuries. Reaching up, he felt the already healing indentation in his back with delicate fingers. The stave the girl had thrust into him had brushed his heart, but it hadn\u0027t pierced it. A half centimeter to one side, and he would have been dead. Real y dead, this time, not undead. Grabbing hold of a velvet-covered chair with one hand, Ethan pul ed himself to his feet and looked around. His lieutenants in the Vitale Society, his friends, lay dead on the floor. The Salvatore brothers, and the girls who were with them, had escaped. Nervously, he felt in one pocket and sighed in relief as his hand closed on a smal vial. Pul ing it out, he looked at the thick red liquid within. Stefan Salvatore\u0027s blood. He fished in the same pocket and drew out a cloth bearing a long reddish-brown stain. Damon Salvatore\u0027s blood. He had what he needed. Klaus would rise again.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hunters-moonsong-the-vampire-diaries-2/page-43.html","bookId":2067,"book":{"id":2067,"title":"The Hunters: Moonsong (The Vampire Diaries #2)","description":"Storyline: Moonsong (The Vampire Diaries: The Hunters, #2) After escaping the horrors of the Dark Dimension, Elena and her friends can\u0027t wait to attend Dalcrest College, the beautiful ivy-covered campus where Elena\u0027s parents met.
