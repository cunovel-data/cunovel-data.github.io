{"id":97620,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"Lanquin, Guatemala As seemed to be true wherever the faithful gathered, there was a small church in Coban with a legend surrounding it. El Calvario church had been founded upon a hillside, in a place where a hunter had seen a pair of jaguars resting in the sun on one day, and an image of Christ the next. Tour guides never attempted to explain the connection between jungle cats and the son of God, nor did they give much credence to the legend that Saint Simon had been buried in the foundations of the church. Their disbelief could not alter the truth, however. The grave existed and would never be discovered until the church was torn down. But the head of Maximon had not been buried with his body. Less than an hour\u0027s drive away, a mile outside the small village of Lanquin, there lay another remote tourist destination, an extensive system of limestone caves that had never been properly explored. Lights were strung along a half mile or so of the main cave and visitors braved the guano-slicked surfaces every day during welcome hours, but there were signs everywhere that warned spelunkers not to go far on their own, as no maps had ever been made of the system\u0027s furthest and deepest reaches. Had local authorities ever been bold enough to attempt it, they would have found that the vast underground hollows went far longer and deeper than anyone imagined, and that the furthest and deepest of them ended abruptly in a wall that geologists would have at first mistaken for hardened volcanic lava due to the way the stone seemed to have flowed in to close off a segment of tunnel that lay deeper still. At the base of that strange wall lay a small cairn of three black stones, each etched with symbols whose meaning had been lost with the death of the last Mayan sorcerer centuries before. Beneath that cairn lay a flat, unremarkable stone obelisk, the lid of a stone box that had been sunken into the floor of the dead-ended cave. And beneath the obelisk lay the severed head of the demon monk the locals had first called Brother Simon and later Maximon. A river flowed out from the main Lanquin cave entrance, creating a place of beauty and serenity that drew tourists even beyond those who wished to explore the subterranean mystery. On this night, the sun had set shortly after six p.m. and now, several hours later, the only people in the vicinity were a group of eight British university students who had set up a trio of tents in the camping area not far from the river and the cave mouth. Two of the students were in their tent making love while the other five sat around a small fire they had built to heat their coffee. They talked of the beauty of Guatemala and argued over whether it was possible to be homesick while also being tempted to stay forever. Of them all, only Meg heard the sound that issued from the mouth of the cave and carried over the burble of the river onto the wind. \u0027What is it?\u0027 one of the others asked when she frowned and turned toward the water. \u0027Not sure,\u0027 Meg replied. \u0027An animal, y\u0027think?\u0027 Screaming, she thought. Something is screaming. But the screams did not come from an animal. They rose from beneath the obelisk lid of a stone box set into the floor of the furthest, deepest part of the cave . . . from the severed head of Maximon. The caves began to tremble and the black rock atop the cairn slid to the stone floor. The strange wall blocking the tunnel began to bubble and then to drip, and soon the rock started to flow like molten lava, melting and spreading along the cave floor. With a hiss, an opening appeared at the top of the wall, growing quickly wider. Air rushed through from the cave into the darkness beyond, but only for a moment before the depths behind the melting wall seemed to exhale a sulfurous steam. The caves quaked and the earth groaned. Above ground, the British campers fled, clutching at one another. Meg called back to her mates, the two who had been making love inside their tent. When the entire cave system cracked open, releasing a blast of heat and the steam of an underground river evaporating, the entire campsite tumbled down into the rocky maw. Like the jagged mouth of the planet itself, the huge break in the earth went on for miles, but Meg could only stare at the spot where her two closest friends had been swallowed up by the stretching, roaring fissure. The unexplored depths of the Languin Caves had been laid open to the sky. She could only watch as gigantic, impossible things began to emerge from the stink and steam and stone. Meg fell to her knees in prayer, though whether she prayed to her own God to protect her or to these ancient, terrible gods to spare her, even she could not be certain. Airborne Octavian stared out the window of the airplane into the night, its blue-black hue a shade of darkness only found above the clouds. After a moment, he turned to Commander Metzger. \u0027You\u0027re sure about this? The legend says the entrance to Xibalba is in Coban.\u0027 Metzger still clutched his phone. He\u0027d received a call moments before and now he held the object out as if it were evidence. \u0027I\u0027m only telling you the reports that are coming in,\u0027 Metzger said. He glanced at Allison and Charlotte, then back at Sergeant Galleti. \u0027Twenty-seven minutes ago - more like thirty, now - massive seismic activity was recorded in the Alta Verapaz region of Guatemala. An earthquake, yes, but impossibly localized, very much like what happened in Saint-Denis.\u0027 Octavian nodded. \u0027All right. So it\u0027s not Coban. Where did you say-\u0027 \u0027A place called Languin,\u0027 Metzger replied. \u0027There\u0027s an unmapped cave system that draws tourists to the area. I\u0027m told it\u0027s only an hour or so from Coban.\u0027 \u0027It does make sense,\u0027 Allison said. \u0027You said yourself that the entrance to Xibalba was supposed to be underground.\u0027 Octavian took a deep breath and turned to look at the people on the plane - two Shadows and a handful of soldiers who spent most of their time hunting vampires. If there were demons pouring out of a hole in the ground, they\u0027d be as good as dead unless he could take the brunt of the battle upon himself. It would take hours for the local military to get troops to such a remote location, and even longer for any UN forces to arrive. The UN security forces were already stretched thin, and Octavian realized that Cortez had been counting on that as well. This unseen enemy, unknown to him until so recently, had been planning for a very long time, but Octavian still did not understand the end game. Did Cortez really think he could make himself some kind of modern death god? \u0027I knew there would be a breach,\u0027 he said, addressing everyone on the small plane. \u0027But I\u0027d hoped we had figured out what Cortez had in mind in time to get here before it happened. Well, now it\u0027s happening. We\u0027re going to land as close as possible to the location of these caves and then we\u0027ll be right in the thick of it. We will be the First Responders here. I guess I don\u0027t have to tell you all how ridiculously outnumbered we\u0027re going to be.\u0027 He let that sink in for a moment and then he looked at Metzger. \u0027Some of us have been here before,\u0027 Octavian said. \u0027Not literally here, but in situations as large and as grave as this one. Allison and I, and to a lesser extent, Charlotte-\u0027 \u0027We\u0027ve all been here before,\u0027 Commander Metzger said. Octavian frowned and studied the faces of the soldiers who sat silent and grim. \u0027You were there for the Tatterdemalion, Commander. I\u0027ll give you that one. But for the rest of you, unless you were also in that battle, or in Salzburg when Liam Mulkerrin came back, you can\u0027t know what you\u0027re walking into. I won\u0027t ask you to stay back, because I know that\u0027s not what good soldiers do. But I will ask you to fight smart, to rely on Allison, Charlotte and myself, to use us well. The three of us will be very difficult to kill.\u0027 He let the second half of that sentence go unsaid, knowing they would all hear it regardless. They were fragile. Mortal. Ordinary. \u0027I insisted on finding Cortez before I worried about these breaches,\u0027 he went on. \u0027I never figured the two could possibly be connected.\u0027 \u0027Nobody did,\u0027 Charlotte said, more tenderly than Octavian believed he deserved. He tipped a slight nod toward her in silent thanks, and went on. \u0027It\u0027s my belief that Cortez is here somewhere. He wasn\u0027t at Bannerman\u0027s Arsenal or in Seattle and we can assume he wasn\u0027t in Saint-Denis or Siena or Oriyur, either. But if our theories about Maximon are right - and I think they are - then whatever\u0027s going on here has been his purpose all along. I don\u0027t know him-\u0027 \u0027I do,\u0027 Charlotte said, her eyes dull and reptilian. \u0027He\u0027s a cunning, ruthless son of a bitch. And he\u0027s proud. If whatever he\u0027s doing is coming to a head, he wouldn\u0027t miss it.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m counting on it,\u0027 Octavian said. \u0027You keep your eyes open. You spot any vampires you think might be giving orders, you give me a shout out on your comm unit. I will take him out.\u0027 Commander Metzger sat up straighter. \u0027We talked about this. If you kill him before we can find out what he was planning-\u0027 \u0027Then he can\u0027t finish whatever he\u0027s starting,\u0027 Allison put in. Octavian dropped his gaze, logic fighting his hunger for vengeance. At last he nodded. \u0027The commander is right,\u0027 he said, glancing at Allison and then at Charlotte. \u0027Peter-\u0027 Charlotte began, a warning in her voice. He didn\u0027t blame her. After all Cortez had done to her, she had as much reason to want him dead as Octavian himself. \u0027If he\u0027s set something in motion that only he knows how to stop, we\u0027ll have to hold off killing him until the crisis has passed,\u0027 Metzger said. \u0027And then he dies?\u0027 Charlotte asked, fixing her gaze on Octavian rather the commander. \u0027Screaming,\u0027 Octavian promised. Charlotte said nothing, but the hard edge of her gaze said that she would hold him to that. \u0027How much longer?\u0027 Allison asked, breaking the moment. Sergeant Galleti asked the same question, this time on her comm. \u0027Less than thirty minutes to touch down,\u0027 she said. \u0027They\u0027re just confirming that there\u0027s room enough on the road for us to land.\u0027 \u0027On the road?\u0027 Allison asked. Octavian felt the plane begin to bank and descend, and as it did - and they moved closer to Cortez - he let the grief and fury that he had held in abeyance begin to flow back into his heart. The flesh of his hands prickled with the dark, murderous magic that simmered inside him. Almost time, Nikki, he thought. Almost time. Coban, Guatemala Charlotte felt herself caught in the current of fate, as if it were a deep river carrying her over rocks and hurtling her downstream without any hope of her making it to shore. She knew that was foolishness; at any moment she could step back from this and simply walk away, not engage in any further conflict. She could leave war and vengeance to Octavian. But when the explosion at Bannerman\u0027s Arsenal had scattered her atoms and she had spent so long drawing her consciousness back together again, she had also surrendered herself to destiny. She had no experience with war, but she knew how to fight and how to reach deep into her heart to muster the strength to go on. Her heart felt like cold black stone in her chest, now. And yet the hollowness she felt was an illusion, for she was not entirely devoid of emotion. Hate remained, as did - if she allowed herself to admit it - just the tiniest sliver of hope. If she survived this crisis and saw Cortez dead by her own hand, or by Octavian\u0027s if fate decreed it must be so, then perhaps she would find a spark of light still remaining in her, and a way to live without the revulsion and rage that now ate at her. \u0027You all right?\u0027 Allison asked. Charlotte flinched, startled from her reverie. She glanced at the other woman - the other Shadow - and gave a small shrug. \u0027What does that even mean?\u0027 she asked. Allison frowned. \u0027What it always means. Is there something wrong?\u0027 Charlotte arched an eyebrow. \u0027I appreciate the concern. Really, I do. But are you fucking kidding?\u0027 For a moment Allison looked worried, but then she gave a small laugh. \u0027Yeah, I guess it\u0027s a pretty stupid question. Just do me a favor?\u0027 \u0027What\u0027s that?\u0027 \u0027Whatever you\u0027ve got stewing inside you, keep it reined in,\u0027 Allison said. \u0027When the fighting starts, we\u0027ve got to be able to rely on you. Peter\u0027s put his faith in you. Try not to be so distracted by whatever\u0027s haunting you that you get somebody killed.\u0027 Charlotte\u0027s first instinct was to utter some kind of cutting reply, but she thought better of it. Allison\u0027s eyes revealed her tenderness and understanding and Charlotte knew her words were genuine. \u0027Don\u0027t worry, okay?\u0027 she asked. \u0027I\u0027m focused, that\u0027s all.\u0027 Allison nodded and the two Shadows fell silent. Not far off, Octavian and Metzger were talking while Sergeant Galleti seemed to be having difficulty with her comm unit. They were on the tarmac at Coban Airport and they were not alone. Metzger had been in touch with the Guatemalan government moments before they had taken off from Philadelphia and though they had been just over four hours in the air, there had been four companies of Guatemalan soldiers awaiting them when they landed. There were Jeeps and other rough terrain vehicles, as well as four army helicopters which stood black and silent on the broken tarmac. Considering the condition of the airport, Charlotte liked the idea of helicopters. They could take off and land without having to roll down the rutted runway. Metzger\u0027s pilot had done his best but their landing in Guatemala had been rough and frightening. At one point the plane had shaken so badly that Charlotte thought the landing gear might be about to tear right off of the undercarriage. They\u0027d made it without that kind of damage, but she wasn\u0027t sure how easy it would be for the plane to take off again. Instead, she was about to have yet another helicopter ride. A few days ago she had never been on a helicopter, but suddenly climbing into one of the machines felt almost ordinary. \u0027Uh-oh,\u0027 Allison said. \u0027This doesn\u0027t look good.\u0027 Charlotte glanced up just in time to see Octavian and Metzger glaring at each other, practically nose to nose. They were arguing about something, but kept their voices low. Whatever Octavian had to say, he finished saying it and spun on his heel, marching over to Charlotte and Allison. \u0027Let\u0027s get aboard a chopper,\u0027 he said. \u0027What\u0027s wrong?\u0027 Allison asked. At first, Charlotte thought he wouldn\u0027t answer. He strode grimly toward the nearest of the black, unmarked helicopters and she and Allison followed him, wearing equally grave expressions. But when he had slid open the door in the side of the helicopter and stepped back to let them board before him, he shook his head in frustration and glanced at them. \u0027I wanted him to let us go in alone,\u0027 he said. Charlotte\u0027s mouth hung open. \u0027Why the hell would we want to do that?\u0027 \u0027We wouldn\u0027t want to,\u0027 Octavian said, gesturing at the soldiers who were even now responding to barked commands from their superiors, racing to their vehicles and to the other three helicopters. \u0027But these guys are cannon fodder and there are more on the way. For the moment, we should have the element of surprise. I\u0027d go in by myself if-\u0027 \u0027Not gonna happen,\u0027 Allison snapped. \u0027If not for that,\u0027 Octavian said, his anger abating for the first time. \u0027But if the three of us go in quickly and quietly, I could cast the spell to erect the same kind of barrier they\u0027re using at the other incursion sites and get whatever\u0027s coming through the breach contained. A lot of these guys wouldn\u0027t need to die.\u0027 \u0027Why wouldn\u0027t Metzger agree to that?\u0027 Allison asked. Octavian gave her a hard look. \u0027He wants Cortez. If I throw up that barrier and Cortez is there, odds are he\u0027s going to be on the inside. It\u0027s not a solution, just a temporary measure.\u0027 \u0027I get it,\u0027 Charlotte said, feeling her heart darken again. \u0027And I agree. We don\u0027t need a temporary solution. We need to get Cortez and kill him. If he\u0027s really running the show it\u0027ll all fall apart and we\u0027ll worry about picking up the pieces after he\u0027s dead.\u0027 \u0027And if we don\u0027t find him right away?\u0027 Octavian said, turning his ire upon her. \u0027If we don\u0027t find him by sunrise? Or tomorrow? Or the next day? How many men and women will die because we wanted Cortez dead more than we wanted them alive?\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s not fair-\u0027 Charlotte began. \u0027Charlotte,\u0027 Allison put in, \u0027nobody wants Cortez dead more than Peter.\u0027 The pit of Charlotte\u0027s stomach turned to ice and she glared at Allison. \u0027He raped me. Killed me. Nearly killed me again,\u0027 she said. Allison reached for her hand but Charlotte pulled back as if scalded. \u0027I\u0027ve been there,\u0027 Allison said. \u0027Exactly where you are. Tortured. All of it, thanks to Hannibal.\u0027 \u0027Hannibal\u0027s dead, right?\u0027 Charlotte asked. Allison nodded. \u0027Well Cortez is still walking around.\u0027 Octavian had fallen silent, but now she saw that he was looking around the tarmac at the soldiers rushing into action and he had a darkly thoughtful look in his eyes. Abruptly he climbed into the back of the chopper and turned to face them from within. \u0027Move it,\u0027 he said. \u0027Quickly. And turn your commlinks off.\u0027 Allison and Charlotte were aboard in seconds and Octavian slid the door closed. The helicopter pilots had all been sitting in the cockpits of their aircraft waiting for orders, so he greeted them but said nothing more. Octavian rapped the ceiling twice. \u0027Take us up!\u0027 The pilot gave him a dubious look, which didn\u0027t go away when Octavian repeated the order in Spanish. Allison darted forward between the seats, her flesh rippling and fur bursting through her skin as she shapeshifted into a tiger. Showing the pilot her teeth, she gave a low growl, more menacing than a roar because it was laden with purpose. \u0027Take us up,\u0027 Octavian repeated. Rigid with fear, the pilot complied, watching the tiger out of the corner of his eye. The radio crackled and voices cut through, first with inquiries and then with angry shouting, but the presence of the tiger caused him to ignore anything but Allison\u0027s jaws and growled threats. Octavian told him their destination and then they were on their way, Allison remaining up front with the man, just in case his fear eased up enough to cause him to do something foolish. \u0027What changed your mind?\u0027 Charlotte asked as they sped through the night sky, the whump of the rotors loud and brutal. Octavian glanced at her and then at the Allison-tiger in the front. \u0027I realized there was a way to keep the troops safe and still go after Cortez now instead of trapping him inside a barrier.\u0027 \u0027How?\u0027 Charlotte asked. His eyes were narrowed, but she felt sure she saw golden sparks dancing across them. \u0027Simple enough,\u0027 he said. \u0027When I put up the barrier . . . we\u0027ll be inside.\u0027 Lanquin, Guatemala Allison thought Octavian\u0027s plan more than insane - it was suicidal. Or it would have been, had any of them been ordinary. Even with his magic and their shapeshifting, she thought it was still foolish, the kind of risk only a lunatic would take. But she didn\u0027t share these observations with him. After all, it hadn\u0027t been her partner that Cortez had murdered. And if Octavian was going to trap himself behind a wall with a bunch of demons and an open gate to Hell, then she was going to be there to back him up. I guess that makes me a lunatic, too, she thought. But the knowledge didn\u0027t change her mind. Fortunately for her, Octavian\u0027s plan began to unravel moments before they reached their destination. New voices had crackled to life on the helicopter\u0027s radio. The pilot continued to glance at her in fear and she had begun to grow very comfortable with the shape of a tiger, with the muscles corded across her back and the feel of her lip curling back to reveal her teeth when she growled at him. Then she noticed that the sound of the helicopter\u0027s rotors had changed. They had an echo, now, or a parallel. Shifting at the speed of thought, she transformed into her usual guise and turned in the seat to glance out the window. Octavian caught her eye and must have seen the alarm there, because he turned as well. \u0027We have company,\u0027 Allison said, spotting a pair of helicopters that were buzzing after them, quickly gaining. She glanced at the pilot. \u0027Our friend here must have been taking his time.\u0027 \u0027Maybe you\u0027re not as terrifying as you think,\u0027 Octavian said. \u0027He wet himself,\u0027 she replied. \u0027I\u0027m pretty terrifying.\u0027 In truth, she felt badly about the pilot wetting his pants. The poor guy would carry that humiliation his whole life. \u0027What now?\u0027 Charlotte asked. \u0027Doesn\u0027t matter,\u0027 Octavian replied. \u0027We\u0027re here.\u0027 Allison twisted around again and peered out the windshield. He was right. What had been the Lanquin caves was now a deep canyon, a scar on the flesh of the world. It had to go on for at least a mile, but they were descending and with only the moonlight she could not get a good view of what awaited them. Then the lights began to go on, huge banks of them popping on at once as generators fired up. \u0027What the fuck?\u0027 Charlotte said, scrambling to the side window. Long trucks were illuminated, lining the narrow way that led off of the main road, along with a dozen military transports and two enormous artillery guns on flatbeds. \u0027The army\u0027s been busy,\u0027 Octavian said. \u0027They couldn\u0027t have beaten us here,\u0027 Charlotte muttered. \u0027They didn\u0027t. These are reinforcements, coming from elsewhere, and they\u0027ve just rolled up,\u0027 Allison said. She turned to look at Octavian. \u0027Our timing sucks.\u0027 But by then he wasn\u0027t looking at her. He had slid over to peer out the port window. \u0027He\u0027s down there,\u0027 Octavian said. Allison looked as well, but how he could see a single vampire amidst the horrors rising from the newly splintered earth she had no idea. The caves were a chasm and in the light, monsters were rising. Some had already emerged, massive devil-bat creatures larger than any winged animal known to man. They swept in and out of the field of illumination, casting long and jagged shadows. Huge serpents swayed in the depths as if summoned by music, and she saw one slither out of the gash in the earth and vanish into the shadows. But other things were rising from that chasm as well. She could see huge shapes moving in the constant play of shadow and light. At first their size made it impossible for her to accept what it was she saw, but then she realized that these enormous shapes were the heads of giants, just beginning to emerge as if being born from the womb of some ancient Hell. One head gleamed in the light, the yellow of long-buried bone, and the other was adorned with a forest of sprawling antlers. \u0027Oh, my God,\u0027 Allison whispered, and though they were words she had not spoken in a very long time, she meant them as a kind of prayer. \u0027They\u0027re not your gods,\u0027 Octavian said, as if he\u0027d never indicated that Cortez might be below. And how could he have known such a thing with all of the horrors at play down there? Yet even as Allison wondered, the helicopter banked slightly left and she saw what he had seen. Not far from the chasm, whose fetid odors now began to invade the interior of the chopper, she spotted a large gathering of small figures that might have been human beings if she didn\u0027t know better. Dozens of them - perhaps more than a hundred - had arranged themselves in three concentric circles with a single figure at the center. As the chopper dropped lower she saw the gleam of light on their flesh and realized that the vampires, what remained of Cortez\u0027s enormous coven, were all naked and in motion, engaged in a strange, shuffling dance. A ritual. And look what they have summoned, she thought. With a flash and a ripple of color, something huge burst from the trench, escaping the reach of the army\u0027s lights almost immediately. Octavian swore under his breath. While Charlotte was asking what he\u0027d seen, Allison watched it spear upward through the darkness. Moonlight and the glow from below glinted off of its undulating body as the huge thing slithered through the air in a serpentine ribbon, trailing feathers of gold and green and red. It arced toward them, and Allison cried out for the pilot to bank left, but it didn\u0027t matter. The thing veered off, driving straight into the windscreen of the nearest of the choppers behind them. It coiled around the craft, rotors snapping off as they struck unyielding flesh, and then together the helicopter and the feathered serpent plummeted to the ground. \u0027What the fuck was that?\u0027 Charlotte demanded. \u0027My signal to get the hell out of here,\u0027 the pilot said in heavily accented English. Nobody called him on his facility with the language; they were too preoccupied with not dying. \u0027Not yet,\u0027 Octavian said. \u0027Get us lower.\u0027 The pilot scoffed. \u0027Or what, you kill me? I die if I stay.\u0027 The chopper continued veering left for another moment and then straightened its course, heading due south, away from the trench and the evils issuing from it. Octavian started arguing with the pilot but Allison\u0027s focus was elsewhere. She craned her neck to see behind them and to the right, where three of the devil-bats - horned, leathery things with fifteen-foot wingspans - were attacking the sides and front of another chopper, staying well away from its rotors. \u0027What about Metzger and Galleti and the others?\u0027 she asked. \u0027They\u0027ve got to be on one of those. Maybe the one that just went down.\u0027 Charlotte stared at her. \u0027Why do you care? I mean, after all Task Force Victor did to you?\u0027 Allison would have explained to her, would have said that Leon Metzger was a good man and that his unit was doing important work, that he didn\u0027t deserve to die because he had followed orders and kept Allison on the TFV\u0027s most wanted list. But then the chopper already on the ground exploded and the blast shook them, even this far away. \u0027The second one\u0027s going down,\u0027 Octavian said, his voice cold and grim. \u0027Shit,\u0027 Allison whispered. They watched quietly as the helicopter under siege by devil-bats lost altitude. One of the creatures had laid itself across the windshield, and the other must have gotten in the way of the rotors after all, because they were tangled with strands of its slippery viscera. They still spun, but slowly, and as Allison watched it descend she prayed that some of those aboard would survive the landing. What then? she wondered. What would become of them on the ground? \u0027Tell the last chopper to land or turn back!\u0027 Octavian snapped. Then he reached up and grasped Allison\u0027s arm, tugging her toward the rear of the chopper. \u0027Come on. Enough of this.\u0027 He grabbed the latch and hauled it back, then dragged the port gunnery door open. The chopper swayed with the change in air pressure and the pilot shouted at him, but Octavian was past listening. Allison understood. They\u0027d passed the point of no return a long, long time ago. \u0027Go!\u0027 Octavian shouted. Charlotte needed no further urging. She leaped out of the helicopter, shapeshifting as she hit the open air and began to plummet. Allison expected an eagle or hawk but instead the girl became a sparrow, perhaps thinking herself small enough to reach the ground unnoticed. Octavian took two running steps and dived, his hands seeming to ignite with emerald flame as he did. A shimmering disc of magic took shape beneath him and a moment later he was standing atop it, lowering himself to the ground as if riding an elevator to the ground floor. Allison turned to mist and drifted after them, spun away in the wake of the helicopter for a short time before she could descend swiftly to the ground, where they could all greet the horrors close up. As she restored her flesh, she heard chanting, the voices of dozens of vampires raised in either worship or incantation. Or both, she thought with a shiver. Shrieks of devil-bats joined the chanting and the sound of retreating helicopters, but above the cacophony she heard her name and turned to see Charlotte running toward her, red hair flying in the breeze. \u0027The second chopper didn\u0027t explode,\u0027 Charlotte said, coming to a halt and immediately gesturing back the way she\u0027d come. \u0027If there are survivors, they\u0027re not going to last long without help.\u0027 Allison started rushing back in that direction with her. They hurried across sharp grass and past copses of trees. \u0027I don\u0027t get it,\u0027 Allison said. \u0027You were the one who didn\u0027t think I should care what \u0027-\u0027 \u0027Medusa!\u0027 Charlotte said, shooting her a sidelong glance as they ran. \u0027In vampires alone we\u0027re outnumbered about fifty to one. If any of Metzger\u0027s people were on that chopper, their guns are loaded with Medusa bullets. We need those guns, need the toxin.\u0027 Shouts came from up ahead, punctuated by gunshots that echoed through the night. The wreckage of the helicopter loomed and Allison heard rending metal and breaking glass as the pair of devil-bats that had survived their encounter with the machine continued to beat and tear at it to try to get to the human meat at its core. \u0027You think they have enough bullets to even the odds? Did you see the size of Cortez\u0027s coven?\u0027 Allison asked. Charlotte replied but over the chaotic noises around them, Allison didn\u0027t hear the words. \u0027What\u0027s that?\u0027 she shouted, racing toward the helicopter and its attackers. She glanced at Charlotte, saw the outline of the girl\u0027s tattoos gleaming in the moonlight and the grim set of her jaw. \u0027I said, as long as Cortez dies before me, I don\u0027t care about the odds.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s a cheerful thought.\u0027 Charlotte scowled. \u0027It is to me.\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-graves-of-saints-shadow-saga-6/page-15.html","bookId":2601,"book":{"id":2601,"title":"The Graves of Saints (Shadow Saga #6)","description":"Storyline: The Graves of Saints (Shadow Saga #6) For centuries, Vatican sorcerers kept demons and monsters out of our world with the magic found in a grimoire called The Gospel of Shadows. Years ago, to save his people from madmen, Peter Octavian defeated those sorcerers and the Gospel of Shadows itself was banished from the Earth. Ever since, the evils and monstrosities lurking in parallel worlds have been waking to the realization that our magical defences are down - the barriers keeping them out of our world are crumbling. With massive demonic incursions in locations around the world, Octavian should be focused on using his own sorcery to drive the evil out and rebuild our defences. But a renegade vampire named Cortez has murdered the person Octavian loves the most and, even with his friends and allies around him, he is so lost in grief that he can think of nothing but revenge. There are others who can fight the darkness - mages and Shadows, witches and Reapers and vampire samurai - but only the warrior-mage, Peter Octavian, can defeat it. If he will answer the call.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-graves-of-saints-shadow-saga-6.jpg","author":"Christopher Golden","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-graves-of-saints-shadow-saga-6.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:55 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:28:06 PM"}}
