{"id":97611,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\\n\\n The morning passed in slow motion. Octavian had made the necessary phone calls the night before and then slept for several hours, plagued by dark dreams he could not recall upon waking, but which nevertheless seemed to haunt him from the corners of the room. He\u0027d risen before five a.m., showered and dressed, and then spent hours sitting in a chair by the window, looking out at the gray skies and the rain that pattered the glass. Allison had brought him a bouquet of yellow roses, though he had no idea where she had gotten them in the middle of the night. From time to time he stared at the flowers, reaching out to feel the softness of their petals and to marvel at the fragility of the world.\\n\\n Nikki had grown up in Philadelphia. Most of their friends didn\u0027t know that, or had learned it once and promptly forgotten. His love had been a troubadour from the moment her mother, Etta, had died. Etta had taught her daughter to love the blues and to sing from her soul, as if she had known that Nikki would need an outlet for her grief. Nikki had been sixteen when her mother died. She had never met her father and though her mother had a sister in Baltimore, the women were estranged. When Etta had passed away, Nikki had been on her own, and she had hit the road with her guitar and a few changes of clothes.\\n\\n When Nikki left Philadelphia behind, she had truly left it behind. There were a few childhood friends she still heard from now and again, but with Keomany dead, the only people she had been close to had been friends she and Octavian shared and those who came from her life as a musician. Word of her death had already hit the media, and this troubled him. Nikki hadn\u0027t been a huge celebrity, but she had achieved a modicum of fame - certainly enough that strangers and past acquaintances and photographers would show up at any public funeral service, and he didn\u0027t want that.\\n\\n He\u0027d called her manager and asked him to spread the word to Nikki\u0027s old bandmates, and he suspected some of them would show up for the funeral. The details of the service were being kept secret, but anyone willing to do a little digging would be able to figure out that Nikki would be laid to rest with her mother. She would have wanted that, Octavian knew - to share eternity with the woman who had taught her about love and compassion and music.\\n\\n Eternity, he thought, staring out at the rain. He didn\u0027t know how long he would live. Once he had evolved beyond vampirism and become human again, he ought to have lived out the balance of an ordinary lifespan, but with the magic that coursed through him, he had suspected for some time that he was not aging. Nikki had broached the subject more than once, wondering whether they would be able to grow old together, and Octavian had insisted that he didn\u0027t know.\\n\\n Now he had the answer.\\n\\n Numb and hollow except for the hot ember of fury in his gut that helped to burn away the grief, he sat in the chair and let hours tick past. Metzger and his team were doing their jobs, hunting down leads and trying to locate Cortez, mostly thanks to information they\u0027d gleaned from the interview with Charlotte last night.\\n\\n Sergeant Omondi had taken Charlotte back to New York with him this morning to trace one of her contacts. Octavian wanted to join them, wanted the cathartic passion of the hunt to ease his sorrow. In the time he\u0027d spent working as a private detective, trying to get to know the modern human mind better and to help where he could, he had taught himself to be perceptive and to make leaps of deductive logic. He wanted to put those skills to use tracking down Nikki\u0027s killer, but not until after the funeral. He wouldn\u0027t leave her until she was finally at rest.\\n\\n Afterward, there\u0027d be hell to pay.\\n\\n A knock at the door interrupted his ruminations. Octavian frowned, this visitation unwelcome. Reluctantly, he raised a hand, contorted his fingers - which crackled momentarily with an icy blue light - and the door unlocked and swung inward.\\n\\n \u0027Hello?\u0027 Commander Metzger said, with as close to uncertainty in his voice as there might ever be. He was not a man prone to self-doubt or uneasiness.\\n\\n \u0027Come in, Commander,\u0027 Octavian said, not rising from the chair.\\n\\n Metzger stepped into the room, frowning and wary as he glanced around to figure out who had opened the door. But the mystery didn\u0027t hold the man\u0027s attention for long. Octavian could see by the set of his shoulders and the grim steel in his eyes that this was no mere condolence call.\\n\\n \u0027The press is looking for you,\u0027 Metzger said. \u0027The hotel is under strict orders not to reveal that you\u0027ve taken a room here, but don\u0027t be surprised if one of them finds you sooner or later.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They\u0027ll find me only if I want to be found. But you didn\u0027t come here to warn me about the media, Commander. Tell me you\u0027ve located Cortez.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not yet, but we\u0027ve identified the San Diego safe house that Charlotte described and the FBI have the building under surveillance right now. They\u0027re cooperating fully, searching for emergency exits that might not be on the architect\u0027s original plans. I\u0027ve got a squad on the way there. We\u0027re searching Los Angeles for the home base Charlotte claims Cortez and his coven were using, but no luck so far.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All right,\u0027 Octavian said, already moving beyond the conversation, drifting back into the darkness of his ruminations, thinking about eternity and vengeance. \u0027Keep me posted.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s what I\u0027m doing,\u0027 Metzger said. Then, instead of retreating, the commander came further into the room, taking up a position five feet from Octavian, standing over him expectantly. \u0027But we have other problems, now. Trouble that requires your attention.\u0027\\n\\n Octavian tore his focus away from the rain on the windowpane to study Metzger\u0027s features.\\n\\n \u0027Whatever it is can wait.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Tell that to the people who are dying,\u0027 Metzger said.\\n\\n Octavian shot Metzger a withering look.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve been fighting to keep the wolves from the door for years,\u0027 he said. \u0027And I\u0027ll do it again. But this is my time - mine and Nikki\u0027s - and I\u0027m not letting anything tear me away from that. If I\u0027d known my days with her were numbered, there are a lot of things I\u0027d have done differently, but I can\u0027t get those days back.\u0027\\n\\n Metzger regarded him carefully. He seemed about to leave, but then came nearer instead and sat on the end of the bed, barely out of arm\u0027s reach. Not that Octavian needed to touch the man to hurt him; they both knew that.\\n\\n \u0027All our days are numbered,\u0027 Metzger said, with a combination of steel and sympathy. \u0027But these people who are dying in France . . . they\u0027re down to minutes, or maybe seconds. They\u0027re dying right now, and every single one of them has people who are going to wish they could have back the days they squandered on less important things.\u0027\\n\\n Octavian tried to ignore the words, but he could not prevent them from echoing in his head. Nikki was dead and no amount of mourning would bring her back, so what good could he do here in Philadelphia? If a crisis had broken out in Europe, could he simply ignore it?\\n\\n He ran his hands over his face, chin stubble rough on his palms.\\n\\n \u0027Tell me,\u0027 he said, without looking up.\\n\\n \u0027There was a localized earthquake just north of Paris. The Cathedral of Saint-Denis was damaged and there are-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s for the Red Cross to-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027-things coming out of it. Demons. No one\u0027s seen anything like them since the thing with the Tatterdemalion years ago. They\u0027re not wraiths, though. Serpentine bodies covered in some kind of exoskeleton, arms on an upper torso, and lots of teeth. We should have images shortly, but I\u0027m told they\u0027re not clear. Power is disrupted, along with all satellite and broadcast signals. Not gone, but rife with interference.\u0027\\n\\n Metzger leaned forward, making sure Octavian met his gaze.\\n\\n \u0027The French are marshalling a military response, but you and I both know that when an incursion like this takes place, it\u0027s usually more than conventional weapons can handle.\u0027\\n\\n Octavian looked out the window again. The rain seemed to be coming down harder, battering the window so hard that the glass vibrated with its punishment. He thought of Keomany, who had felt the chaos growing in Massachusetts early enough to warn him, to make sure he was there to help set things right. Without Keomany to sense it, he had not seen this coming at all, and he couldn\u0027t help but wonder what other horrors were even now stirring beyond the barriers between worlds.\\n\\n He studied the vase of yellow roses, brow knitting. Rather than wilting, they had blossomed further, growing and blooming with remarkable health, though they had surely been cut many hours before. And had the thorns been so prominent before? He wasn\u0027t certain, but the vigor of cut flowers seemed a poor thing to focus on at the moment, a way for him to distract himself from the truth. Every death in France left a little more blood on his hands. He had acted from pure motives, but he shared responsibility for the dreadful state of the world\u0027s magical defenses. With the fall of the Roman church and the loss of the Gospel of Shadows - the spellbook that contained all of the magic accumulated by Vatican sorcerers since the founding of the church - the safeguards had vanished. Whatever happened now would be partly his fault, and he couldn\u0027t live with himself if he pretended to ignore that. Still . . .\\n\\n Exhaling sharply, he glanced at Metzger.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll advise you,\u0027 he said. \u0027There are mystics and occultists who can help, at least temporarily, to try to contain the demons. But until the funeral tomorrow morning, I\u0027m not going anywhere.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Octavian,\u0027 Metzger prodded.\\n\\n \u0027She loved me. I\u0027m staying with her until the last shovelful of dirt is thrown over her coffin. By then, we\u0027ll have more than enough help on hand to deal with whatever these demons are.\u0027\\n\\n Metzger sighed, but he nodded. \u0027All right. I\u0027ll be back with an update in an hour or two.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027If you confirm Cortez\u0027s location-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ll be the first to know, as agreed,\u0027 Metzger said. \u0027You get the kill.\u0027\\n\\n Octavian nodded and turned again to study the uncannily healthy roses. With a gesture, he caused the hotel room door to unlock and swing inward. If Metzger felt intimidated by this display of magic, he left the room without commenting.\\n\\n \u0027I know I should go,\u0027 he said, whispering to the rain against the glass. \u0027But I can\u0027t leave you. Not yet.\u0027\\n\\n I\u0027d never forgive myself, he thought.\\n\\n A ripple of nausea went through him as he realized that he had already passed that point. On the night when Nikki had needed him most, he had not been here for her. He hadn\u0027t been able to protect her.\\n\\n Some things could simply never be forgiven.\\n\\n Brattleboro, Vermont\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s so wonderful to see you.\u0027\\n\\n Cat smiled. \u0027You too, Heather.\u0027\\n\\n The pretty young earthwitch, who had driven all the way from South Carolina, gave her a firm hug, smiling warmly. With her big blue eyes and fairy-smile, Heather had an almost ethereal presence that Cat had always found very soothing. Of all their friends, Heather was the only one Tori ever seemed to be jealous of, which was funny because the younger witch hadn\u0027t the slightest interest in women. Not that Tori would have had anything to worry about, regardless. Cat adored Heather, but she loved Tori with all her heart.\\n\\n Heather sighed, her expression turning sad.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m sorry I couldn\u0027t make it here in time for Keomany\u0027s memorial.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I know you\u0027d have been here if you could,\u0027 Cat assured her. \u0027And we\u0027ll say goodbye to her again tonight, say a prayer, and raise a glass.\u0027\\n\\n Heather smiled, satisfied with this reply.\\n\\n \u0027You heard about Nikki Wydra, I assume?\u0027 she asked.\\n\\n Cat nodded, a dark weight settling on her heart. \u0027How could I not? With all the media coverage, she\u0027s going to be more famous for having died than she ever was for her music. It\u0027s a sin.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Did you hear from Octavian? You guys are close, right? Are you going to the funeral?\u0027\\n\\n Cat frowned. \u0027Keomany was close to them. We haven\u0027t heard from him. I feel for the guy, but I also can\u0027t help thinking he\u0027s to blame.\u0027\\n\\n Heather\u0027s big blue eyes grew even bigger. \u0027You think he killed her?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, no,\u0027 Cat said quickly. \u0027But look at what happened to Keomany. Octavian\u0027s reckless. So many of his friends have been killed as collateral damage in these battles he\u0027s had. I know he\u0027s doing the right thing, saving lives, all of that . . . but I can\u0027t help thinking that he isn\u0027t careful enough, that people like Keomany and Nikki die because they love him.\u0027\\n\\n Heather nodded gravely. \u0027I never thought about it that way.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Anyway, it doesn\u0027t matter. Tonight, we celebrate,\u0027 Cat said. \u0027Go on into the house. You\u0027re sharing the attic room on the left with Jaleesa. She\u0027s down at the barn getting cider and donuts, I think. You can head on down there or just rest a bit. I know it\u0027s been a long journey for you. I have to check on some things in the orchard and then I\u0027ll be back and we can catch up.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Excellent,\u0027 Heather said. \u0027I am tired, but . . . donuts!\u0027\\n\\n She picked up her duffel bag, gave Cat a kiss on the cheek, and then headed into the house. Watching her go, Cat couldn\u0027t help feeling guilty. She didn\u0027t like to deceive anyone, even if she had only committed sins of omission, but she couldn\u0027t very well tell the other witches what was going on in the orchard - at least not until they knew for certain themselves.\\n\\n Cat set off on foot. It was a ten-minute walk from her house on the property to the clearing in the orchard, but she relished the time she spent amongst the trees, the air sweet with the scent of apples and rich with the smell of earth and growing things. She felt cradled in the embrace of the goddess here, and never wanted to be anywhere else for very long.\\n\\n When she arrived at the clearing, she saw that Ed, the orchard foreman, had put a mesh covering over the enclosure he\u0027d cobbled together around what Cat and Tori and Ed himself had been hopefully referring to as \u0027the new growth\u0027. There were customers wandering through the rows, picking apples, and as Cat approached the clearing she saw a couple with two precious little boys pause to try to look over the enclosure, through the mesh. The father had one son on his shoulders.\\n\\n \u0027What do you see, Kyle?\u0027 the father asked.\\n\\n \u0027A tree, I think,\u0027 the little boy said. \u0027But it\u0027s moving.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Dad, come on!\u0027 the older son whined, and then the family headed off into the rows. The mother and father exchanged a smile and Cat thought she heard the mother say \u0027moving trees\u0027, with the amused indulgence particular to mothers.\\n\\n Cat turned right and worked her way around the enclosure. She heard Tori and Ed speaking before she saw them emerging from a gate that the foreman had included as part of the enclosure. It was a crude thing, just hinges and plywood, but it did its job and had a hoop for a padlock.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s going on in there?\u0027 Cat asked.\\n\\n Tori looked up, a bit startled, but her troubled expression relaxed and she went to give her wife a quick hug and kiss. Ed had been uneasy with their displays of affection once upon a time, but he\u0027d grown used to it.\\n\\n \u0027Everything under control for tonight?\u0027 Tori asked.\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, yeah. We\u0027re good,\u0027 Cat said, waving the question away. \u0027Except, y\u0027know, for this incredible, impossible thing that we have no idea how to address with our guests. So . . . talk to me.\u0027\\n\\n Tori exhaled and smiled at Ed before turning back to Cat. She shrugged.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s growing. Gotta be two and a half feet high by now,\u0027 she said.\\n\\n Cat nodded. \u0027That little boy said it was moving.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Nah,\u0027 Ed put in. \u0027Just the breeze in her hair.\u0027\\n\\n Tori and Cat both shifted awkwardly. They had been trying to avoid calling the new growth she or her. It seemed too hopeful, somehow, particularly since they were not at all certain what they were dealing with. The new growth might have a human shape, but it also had bark in some places and skin like an apple in others, and its features were stiff and unmoving. Roots thrust deeply into the ground, long thin branches that gave the illusion of hair, there was no doubt that this thing was a plant of some kind.\\n\\n Yet, loath as they were to say it out loud, the new growth was also somehow Keomany.\\n\\n \u0027All right,\u0027 Cat said. \u0027What do we do tonight? Do we tell them all what\u0027s going on, and if not, how do we hide this from them?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We can\u0027t tell them. Not yet,\u0027 Tori said. \u0027Anything could happen. The new growth could be damaged. We have to protect it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s that space at the end of row forty-six, on the west side of the hill,\u0027 Ed suggested. \u0027It ain\u0027t as big as this clearing, but it\u0027d be big enough if you wanted to do your ceremony there.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I hate hiding this from them,\u0027 Cat said, sighing as she went to the enclosure and peered over the top, looking down through the mesh thanks to her great height. \u0027They\u0027re our sisters, after all . . . tonight more than any other. It just seems wrong.\u0027\\n\\n Tori edged up beside her and took her hand, squeezing it. \u0027I love them, too. Well, most of them. Heather, Vicky, Ella, Jaleesa . . . I want to share this with them. It\u0027s a miracle, Cat. But I just don\u0027t want to take any risks yet.\u0027\\n\\n Cat nodded. \u0027I know. Me neither.\u0027 She turned to Ed. \u0027Row forty-six it is. Can you get the staff to set up some chairs there? Tori and I are going to have to start preparing the ground for the ceremony.\u0027\\n\\n She hesitated, then turned to her wife, taking both of Tori\u0027s hands in her own. \u0027But we\u0027re going to check in an hour before sunset. It could be that by then she . . . it . . . will have grown enough that there will be no question about the miracle that\u0027s happening here, and then we can share it with all of them.\u0027\\n\\n Tori smiled. \u0027Deal.\u0027\\n\\n They started back down the hill together, hand in hand, both of them wearing enormous grins. The earth magic that had blossomed in their orchard was unlike anything either of them had ever encountered or even heard about.\\n\\n If - no, when! - the new growth reached maturity, would it open its eyes and speak? And if it did, would it speak with Keomany\u0027s voice, or was the thing rooted in their orchard some new creature entirely, given life by the goddess?\\n\\n Cat couldn\u0027t wait to find out.\\n\\n Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\\n\\n Kuromaku stood in the hotel lobby, letting the ebb and flow of human life wash over him. The colors of their garments might be vivid or drab, but he saw beyond such outward expressions, felt the heat of their blood and the vibrancy of their aspirations. There were times he thought he could even see the ties that bound them to one another. Octavian had undergone a metamorphosis years ago that had split his Shadow nature into three parts. Kuromaku had not lived long enough yet for that transition, but he did believe himself to have undergone a slow evolution over the years, a series of small epiphanies that led to what he considered the beginning of wisdom.\\n\\n He was still a warrior, of course, and he had always had honor, even when others would have called him a monster. But he had lived long enough first to grow to disdain human fragility and whimsy, and then to cherish it.\\n\\n The lobby of the hotel where Nikki Wydra had been murdered held interest for Kuromaku. There had been dozens of so-called journalists outside, along with more than one hundred spectators, many of whom he surmised were fans of Nikki\u0027s music. The local police were keeping them out, allying themselves with hotel security to determine who were legitimate guests and visitors. Kuromaku presumed it must be creating havoc for hotel guests, who would undoubtedly want some sort of compensation for the inconvenience.\\n\\n Nikki\u0027s death, an inconvenience. He closed his eyes a moment. As much as he had come to find humanity beautiful, he was far from immune to frustration, and other emotions.\\n\\n When he opened his eyes he saw the police officer who had let him in to the lobby coming toward him, moving around a furious-looking woman who tugged a tow-headed little boy by the hand, even as a bellhop followed with her luggage. She headed for the front desk, having begun her tirade even before she reached the counter, preparing to check out.\\n\\n \u0027Mom? Mom? Mom?\u0027 the boy intoned, yanking her arm to try to get her attention. \u0027Are there really vampires in the hotel?\u0027\\n\\n The boy glanced around, eyes wide with a combination of fear and fascination, as if a vampire might pop out from behind the giant potted fern he had just passed. Kuromaku smiled at the boy\u0027s expression. If you only knew. The mother, however, only hushed him.\\n\\n \u0027Excuse me, sir,\u0027 the young cop said, approaching Kuromaku. \u0027Can you come this way, please?\u0027\\n\\n Kuromaku glanced once more at the boy and his angry mother and then nodded to the officer, gesturing for him to lead the way. In the chaos of noise and confusion in the lobby, a more polite reply would have been lost. Even now, as he followed the officer past two dark-suited security guards, a man near the concierge desk began to shout about the rights of the press, clutching a camera as he was hustled toward the doors.\\n\\n \u0027This is a total mess,\u0027 the cop said, glancing back at Kuromaku. \u0027Bad enough you got a celebrity murder case, but throw vamps in and everybody goes bugfuck crazy. It\u0027s only gonna get worse as word spreads about how she died.\u0027\\n\\n Kuromaku silently agreed as the officer led him past the entrance to the hotel\u0027s restaurant and toward the opening into a grotto of elevator banks.\\n\\n Concerned, the officer slowed and looked at him. \u0027I didn\u0027t mean any disrespect, y\u0027know? About the victim?\u0027\\n\\n Now that they were away from the epicenter of the chaos and it was quieter, Kuromaku nodded.\\n\\n \u0027Of course. A day like today, I imagine your job becomes difficult.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Exactly!\u0027 the cop said, nodding grimly. \u0027It\u0027s a nuthouse in here.\u0027\\n\\n They entered the elevator grotto to find two people seemingly awaiting their arrival. One was a Chinese man who carried himself like a soldier, while the other was an old friend.\\n\\n Kuromaku smiled and opened his arms as he went to her. \u0027Allison. I\u0027m very happy to see you.\u0027\\n\\n Allison Vigeant embraced him firmly. \u0027And I\u0027m glad you\u0027re here, \u0027Maku. I just wish it were under different circumstances.\u0027\\n\\n With a sigh, he released her and stepped back, though he kept one hand on her arm as he met her gaze. In that moment, they had forgotten the other people standing in the grotto with them.\\n\\n \u0027So do I. How is he?\u0027\\n\\n Eyes haunted, Allison lowered her gaze for just a moment before looking up at him again. \u0027About how you\u0027d expect. But he\u0027ll be glad you\u0027re here. There\u0027s all kinds of nasty shit hitting the fan. He\u0027s going to need us, and more besides.\u0027\\n\\n Kuromaku nodded once, unsmiling, and stood a little straighter. \u0027Take me to him.\u0027\\n\\n When the knock came at his hotel room door, Octavian tore his gaze away from the window. He had been watching the silent tumult of the clouds, his thoughts everywhere and nowhere, his grief lying in wait for him to begin to think again.\\n\\n \u0027Who is it?\u0027 he called from the sturdy, cushioned chair.\\n\\n \u0027An old friend.\u0027\\n\\n Octavian froze halfway through a deep breath, then rose and strode purposefully across the room to open the door.\\n\\n One of Metzger\u0027s people was there with Allison - Song, Octavian reminded himself - but his focus was on the third visitor, the one who had spoken, although now he stood behind the others. It had been months since they had seen one another, perhaps more than a year, but most days that seemed like no time at all for men such as they were. Today, it seemed far too long.\\n\\n \u0027My brother,\u0027 Octavian said.\\n\\n Kuromaku smiled. Allison did as well, as she stood aside so that the old friends might be reunited. Kuromaku might not truly be Octavian\u0027s brother - they didn\u0027t share the same father or mother or the same vampiric progenitor - but they were comrades in arms and had been friends for centuries, and to Octavian\u0027s mind, they were closer than any brothers who shared the same blood. Their bond had been forged in blood and in bloodshed, their own and that of their enemies.\\n\\n Octavian pulled him close and clapped him on the back.\\n\\n \u0027Thank you for coming,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027It is where I belong today,\u0027 Kuromaku said.\\n\\n They shared a quiet moment of understanding. Octavian could have said more, but they would have been words he had spoken too many times before. They stood together today and all days, whatever might come.\\n\\n He nodded and turned to Allison. \u0027Come with me, both of you. Now that Kuromaku\u0027s here, there\u0027s something we all need to see.\u0027\\n\\n Octavian pulled his door shut behind him and started down the corridor. All three of them made to follow him, but he paused and glanced at Song.\\n\\n \u0027Not you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Commander Metzger instructed me to-\u0027\\n\\n Octavian held up a hand. \u0027Stop. This isn\u0027t an argument, kid. And no offense meant. But these people here? They\u0027re my family, and what happens next is family business. You go and explain that to Metzger if you want, but if you try to force your way into family business, there\u0027ll be blood, and none of it ours.\u0027\\n\\n He said it as kindly as he could, though he watched Song\u0027s eyes to make sure the soldier understood he meant it. From Song\u0027s irritation, and the sliver of fear in his gaze, it was clear he had gotten the message.\\n\\n \u0027As you say,\u0027 Song replied, his words clipped, and colored by his accent. \u0027I will deliver the message.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You do that,\u0027 Allison said, and she gave him a little wave. \u0027Buh-bye.\u0027\\n\\n Octavian led the way down the corridor, past hotel rooms that were either empty or were occupied by members of Task Force Victor. Metzger had turned this level into a temporary command center for his team and for the investigation into Nikki\u0027s murder. Allison had a room and there was one waiting for Kuromaku as well. Given the killing that had taken place here, the hotel had willingly accommodated the request to clear the floor of guests and reinstall them in other rooms. They might not have been happy about it, but Octavian suspected most of the guests were only too pleased to be away from the police, FBI, and TFV foot traffic.\\n\\n \u0027You don\u0027t seem to like Corporal Song,\u0027 Kuromaku said.\\n\\n Allison sniffed. \u0027He\u0027s Task Force Victor. Our disdain is mutual.\u0027\\n\\n Octavian knew that Kuromaku would want a longer conversation with him. His old friend would want to offer his condolences more formally. But they had stood side by side or back to back in enough battles and lost enough loved ones down through the years that Kuromaku\u0027s sympathy was understood. To soldiers such as they were, the aftermath of tragedy was nearly always the time for action.\\n\\n \u0027Here,\u0027 Octavian said, stopping in front of Nikki\u0027s hotel room. He was surprised no guard was on duty.\\n\\n A rap on the door brought a swift reply. With a click, the door swung inward to reveal a thin, fortyish woman in an FBI jacket. The room was a mini-suite, with a little sitting room sort of foyer and the main bedroom area beyond. Beyond the FBI agent, Octavian could see Barbieri - the TFV forensics specialist - along with a couple of FBI crime scene techs.\\n\\n \u0027Can I help you?\u0027 the woman asked, frowning as she gazed at the three of them.\\n\\n Octavian ignored her, looking at Barbieri. \u0027I need the room.\u0027\\n\\n The FBI woman scowled. \u0027Who the hell are you?\u0027\\n\\n Barbieri had the good sense to look uncomfortable. \u0027Agent Kline, this is Peter Octavian.\u0027\\n\\n The woman\u0027s face went blank and she drew back slightly. \u0027I see.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I need-\u0027 Octavian began again.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m sorry for your loss, Mr Octavian,\u0027 Agent Kline said, \u0027but I\u0027m sure you understand that the crime scene is still being processed.\u0027\\n\\n Octavian felt a flare of anger that caused him to clench his fist and make his hand crackle with the dark purple light of deadly spellcraft. It was happening more and more, his emotions stirring the magic within him, and he knew he had to be cautious. There was danger here.\\n\\n \u0027Bullshit,\u0027 he said evenly. \u0027Philadelphia PD was in here. Barbieri and his UN vampire hunters have been over the room, top to bottom. Your own people have been in here for hours. You\u0027re done. It\u0027s my turn, now.\u0027\\n\\n Agent Kline glanced beyond him at Allison and Kuromaku, then focused on Octavian again.\\n\\n \u0027For what?\u0027 she asked.\\n\\n Octavian stared at her, then shifted his gaze purposefully back to Barbieri.\\n\\n \u0027To do it my way. Get them out of here, Barbieri. I won\u0027t ask again.\u0027\\n\\n He didn\u0027t need to. Agent Kline continued to protest, but mostly in muttered asides. Octavian was certain that Barbieri - like Song - would report back to Metzger, but none of that mattered. Metzger needed him far more than he needed Task Force Victor.\\n\\n \u0027This is the place, then?\u0027 Kuromaku asked, when the others were all gone.\\n\\n Octavian glanced around the bedroom, his eyes lingering on the bed where he had found Nikki displayed in a macabre tableau. Kuromaku knew the answer. He had asked only to give Octavian a chance to speak, to explain.\\n\\n \u0027This . . . yes,\u0027 Octavian replied. He gestured to the bed and then around at the markings and little numbered plastic tents that the forensics people had left behind. \u0027Most of it you can imagine for yourself. I\u0027ve tried not to imagine it, but I\u0027ve failed. It\u0027s in me, now . . . this thing. Every breath I take, it haunts me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027re going to kill him and his whole coven,\u0027 Allison said.\\n\\n \u0027We will,\u0027 Kuromaku agreed, but he reached out and put a strong hand on the back of Octavian\u0027s neck. \u0027But it won\u0027t help the pain.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Maybe not,\u0027 Octavian said, \u0027but we\u0027ll kill them just the same.\u0027\\n\\n He took a deep breath, steadying his heartbeat and narrowing his eyes. Reaching down within himself, he summoned up the magic there and extended his hands. During the millennium he had spent in Hell, he had learned thousands upon thousands of spells and hexes and enchantments and glamours, but at a certain point his understanding of magic had outstripped what could be studied and entered the world of intuition. Sorcery was a combination of elements that included the extant supernatural energies woven into the fabric of reality, as well as a facility to wield and weave those energies. Nikki had once compared his abilities to a nuclear scientist being able to manipulate atoms merely by thinking of them. She hadn\u0027t been far off, though magic was more involved than that.\\n\\n It took focus and discipline, knowledge and purpose . . . And it took passion. Love worked, as did anger. Or grief.\\n\\n \u0027I could have done this before you arrived, but I wanted you both to see it,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027What are we seeing?\u0027 Allison asked warily, her usual bravado gone.\\n\\n Octavian contorted his hands and dragged them through the air, which had become warm and malleable around him. It flowed sluggishly around his fingers like paint and slow ripples spread outward, reality shuddering and changing.\\n\\n The room grew darker, and the curtains that had been open a moment before were now closed. The time here in Philadelphia, on the twelfth floor of the Loews Hotel, was late afternoon, but a sliver of early morning sunlight shone in through the gap in the curtains.\\n\\n \u0027Just in case,\u0027 Octavian said softly. \u0027I\u0027m worried that I\u0027ll miss something important . . . some detail that we\u0027ll need.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Peter?\u0027 Kuromaku said warily.\\n\\n \u0027Hush,\u0027 Octavian said. \u0027Just watch.\u0027\\n\\n He kept his back to them. He didn\u0027t want to see their expressions, or his own reflected in their eyes.\\n\\n Out in the foyer of the mini-suite, there came two clicks, one soft and one slightly louder. The door swung inward and Nikki entered the room. Octavian felt a surge of love and longing that quickly turned to ice inside him. He could smell a citrus odor that he realized came from the maid\u0027s cleaning products, a scent that had been lacking when the crime scene people had finished their work.\\n\\n \u0027Peter, you don\u0027t have to do this,\u0027 Allison said. \u0027We know what happened.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Just in case,\u0027 he said again, steeling himself.\\n\\n Octavian, Allison, and Kuromaku stood like ghosts in the room as Nikki put the key card for her room on the small coffee table by the loveseat out in the mini-suite\u0027s foyer. She walked into the bedroom and stripped off her black shirt, glancing around until she spotted the discarded pajamas laid across a chair by the heavily draped windows. Looking tired and grateful to be able to exhale, she unhooked her bra and removed it.\\n\\n Shadows swirled like liquid blackness in the corner of the room, coalescing into a lean, sculpted figure.\\n\\n \u0027You are lovely,\u0027 the figure rasped.\\n\\n Cortez had arrived to murder her, to tear out her throat and nail her to the wall, and Octavian could only watch, for these events had already unfolded.\\n\\n Revenge seemed such a small thing to him, now.\\n\\n But it was all he had. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-graves-of-saints-shadow-saga-6/page-6.html","bookId":2601,"book":{"id":2601,"title":"The Graves of Saints (Shadow Saga #6)","description":"Storyline: The Graves of Saints (Shadow Saga #6) \\n For centuries, Vatican sorcerers kept demons and monsters out of our world with the magic found in a grimoire called The Gospel of Shadows. Years ago, to save his people from madmen, Peter Octavian defeated those sorcerers and the Gospel of Shadows itself was banished from the Earth. Ever since, the evils and monstrosities lurking in parallel worlds have been waking to the realization that our magical defences are down - the barriers keeping them out of our world are crumbling. \\n With massive demonic incursions in locations around the world, Octavian should be focused on using his own sorcery to drive the evil out and rebuild our defences. But a renegade vampire named Cortez has murdered the person Octavian loves the most and, even with his friends and allies around him, he is so lost in grief that he can think of nothing but revenge. There are others who can fight the darkness - mages and Shadows, witches and Reapers and vampire samurai - but only the warrior-mage, Peter Octavian, can defeat it. If he will answer the call.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-graves-of-saints-shadow-saga-6.jpg","author":"Christopher Golden","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-graves-of-saints-shadow-saga-6.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:55 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:28:06 PM"}}
