She almost called for Cat to see who it was, but then she recalled that her wife was in the shower. It had been a long day, full of tears and hard work, of grief and hopeful preparation. Tori found it difficult to look forward to the equinox with the pain of Keomany\u0027s death so fresh. She had become like a sister both to her and to Cat, a constant reassuring presence, and her absence would leave a dreadful void.\\n\\n \u0027Damn it,\u0027 she whispered, wiping the back of her hand across her eyes.\\n\\n It had been like this ever since Octavian had shown up with the news, and with Keomany\u0027s ashes . . . in a damned wine bottle. She\u0027d be fine, and then the tears would start.\\n\\n Frustrated with herself, even though she knew that her grief was entirely to be expected, she rinsed her hands and shut off the tap. The doorbell rang again as she dried her hands with a dishtowel and she tossed it onto the counter as she hurried out of the kitchen. She and Cat had an agreement; at dinner time, one of them cooked and the other one cleaned up afterward. Since Cat\u0027s culinary achievements rarely went further than sauteed vegetables or tofu stir fry, Tori tended to be the one making the meals. Tonight, one of their sisters in the craft had brought fresh swordfish, and Cat had gleefully prepared it blackened Cajun style, with dirty rice on the side, the one dish she really felt confident in making. If they\u0027d had time, Tori would have made a light gumbo to go along with it, but today hadn\u0027t been the day for such things. A quiet night of reflection with the woman she loved, a nice meal, a glass of wine . . . these were all she required to find contentment tonight.\\n\\n And perhaps there would be more to look forward to, tonight. Cat had a strange reaction to death, and always had. It made her angry and it made her want to seize life with both hands and squeeze. It made her want to scream and to laugh, but especially it made her want to lose herself in love and in mind-shattering orgasms - both giving and receiving. This had gone unspoken between them, but Tori knew her pattern. For herself, she would rather have mourned quietly, shared memories of Keomany, and left it until the equinox to make love, as they always did at the turns of the year. But she knew what Cat needed, and she would open her heart and her body to provide that solace.\\n\\n That plan, however, did not allow for unexpected visitors.\\n\\n It was strange, getting a knock on the door. Most of the employees had gone home by now, and the earthwitches who had arrived from out of town for the equinox had all pursued their own plans for the evening. Several of them, those Cat and Tori knew best, had originally been invited to stay here at the orchard house, but as if by mutual agreement - and perhaps that was the case - they had all retreated to hotels upon learning of Keomany\u0027s death, giving their hosts time to mourn.\\n\\n Tori cocked her head, trying to see through the tempered glass panels in the front door. She flicked on the outside light, turned the lock, and pulled the door open.\\n\\n \u0027Ed? What\u0027s wrong?\u0027\\n\\n The orchard foreman stood on the front steps, breathing hard and looking at her with wide eyes. Ed Rushton had been with them for three years, overseeing all of the harvesting at Summerfields. Fifty-one years old, tall and powerfully built, he always wore a baseball cap to protect his balding pate from the sun. Night had fallen, and now he clutched his cap tightly in both hands.\\n\\n \u0027Best you just see for yourself,\u0027 he said, nodding, and he started down the steps. The ATV he used to motor around the orchard sat on the dirt road, fifty feet from the front door.\\n\\n Tori moved out onto the stoop. A strong breeze blew past her, bringing the rich smells of earth and plants and apples.\\n\\n \u0027Ed?\u0027\\n\\n He shot her a look that spoke of fear and wonder in equal measure. \u0027Tori, please. I\u0027ve seen a lot of things since coming to work here, and I can\u0027t complain. You and Cat gave me the rundown before I started. Elemental magic, naked witchy rituals, loving the earth . . . to be honest, I like it. And not just the naked part. I don\u0027t understand witchcraft - earthcraft, or whatever - but I know you\u0027re good people and that there\u0027s only love in what you do. But this is . . . Hell, I don\u0027t know what.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What is going on?\u0027\\n\\n Despite his farmer\u0027s tan, the foreman looked pale.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ve gotta just come with me,\u0027 he said. \u0027If I try to explain, it\u0027ll sound crazy or stupid or both.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All right.\u0027 She glanced back into the house, thought of Cat in the shower, and then pulled the door shut behind her. Whatever this was, she\u0027d be back soon. And she had her cell phone; Cat would call or text her if she was worried.\\n\\n Ed climbed onto the ATV and Tori got on behind him, holding tightly to him as she straddled the machine. Growing up, she\u0027d always ridden like this on the back of her brother Johnny\u0027s dirtbike, and the memory rose up and lingered in her head as Ed drove her down the road and turned up into the orchard. Johnny had died when she was fifteen, and memories of him were always bittersweet. She loved her life, loved Cat and what they\u0027d built here at Summerfields, but she\u0027d have given almost anything to have another day with Johnny. Unfortunately, there were some things even magic could not do.\\n\\n The ATV jounced through a pothole in the path leading up into the orchard. They passed pumpkin beds and entered the thick of the orchard, with rows of apple trees stretching across the hill for acres in either direction.\\n\\n When she realized where Ed must be taking her, she clutched him even tighter.\\n\\n \u0027What the hell is this?\u0027 she called over the guttural growl of the ATV\u0027s motor.\\n\\n He turned his head and raised his voice to be heard. \u0027You\u0027re going to have to tell me.\u0027\\n\\n Then they were pulling into the clearing where they had said their goodbyes to Keomany that morning, and where they would be conducting their equinox ceremony. In the center of the clearing stood the new tree that Keomany had nurtured from seed to maturity in moments. It was the most robust tree in the orchard, now, with the finest apples.\\n\\n Something else had grown in the clearing.\\n\\n Ed killed the ATV\u0027s engine, its growl echoing in Tori\u0027s ears for several seconds. The silence that followed, broken only by the rustle of the breeze in the trees, felt like the world holding its breath.\\n\\n She climbed off the back of the ATV. Ed stayed where he was, staring at the new thing that had sprouted from the soil. He had obviously come across it while traversing the orchard and now, having seen it once, had no interest in getting near to it again.\\n\\n \u0027Goddess,\u0027 Tori whispered as she walked toward it, unsure even as she spoke if it was a prayer or a cry for help. The smell of earth and apples filled the air, swirling on the breeze.\\n\\n Her heart thrummed in her chest, a captive hummingbird. Her face felt flushed and her breath came in short, shallow sips as she knelt in the dirt and stared at the new growth, which looked like no tree or bush she had ever seen. Perhaps fourteen inches high, it had skin like an apple, and thick roots that went deep into the ground, covered in bark. It had the shape - the figure - of a woman, though it did not move except for the stirring caused by the wind, and though it had no expression, it did indeed have a face.\\n\\n Keomany\u0027s face.\\n\\n Goddess.\\n\\n Tori began to weep. Though she felt a shiver of fear, most of what she felt - what made her hands shake and caused the grin that broke out on her face - was the joy of miracles.\\n\\n \u0027Ed,\u0027 she said, her voice cracking with emotion. \u0027Get a fence up around this right away. Tonight.\u0027 She stood and looked at him. \u0027And don\u0027t breathe a word.\u0027\\n\\n Airborne\\n\\n The deep, bass chop of the helicopter\u0027s rotors felt like an assault on Charlotte\u0027s ears, a thumping on her chest, as if she sat inside a quickening heart that beat from without instead of within. Normally she would not have been quite as nervous. A vampire could easily survive a helicopter crash - even an explosion. But she still had traces of the Medusa toxin in her blood and she didn\u0027t like her chances if the chopper went down.\\n\\n Five people shared the rear compartment of the helicopter with her. Three of them were rank-and-file members of Task Force Victor, soldiers-turned-vampire-hunters who clearly had a very dim view of her. The youngest, a buzzcut Chinese guy named Song, no more than twenty, kept stealing glances at her that seemed to say he thought it was a shame that a cute girl who looked near his own age was a bloodsucking freak. Song kept getting disgusted scowls from the only other woman on the chopper, a Brazilian named Galleti who had a quartet of scars on the left side of her throat that could only have been clawmarks. The two of them took orders from Sergeant Omondi, a New Yorker by way of Kenya. He was maybe thirty, six and a half feet tall and built like a tank, though the intellect sparkling in his eyes belied that great size. Omondi was no brute.\\n\\n As much as they intrigued her, these armed soldiers who had dedicated their lives to exterminating her kind, she was far more interested in the other two people riding in the back of the chopper. The rumpled, goateed Barbieri carried a few too many pounds, especially as he looked to be nearing fifty, but he had kind eyes. He certainly didn\u0027t match any image her mind would have conjured of a forensics expert specializing in tracking vampires.\\n\\n Of all of them, it was Commander Leon Metzger who scared her the most. When she\u0027d been taken into custody in front of the Shadow Registry building, it had been Metzger\u0027s order that kept her from being burned alive with the assassins Cortez had sent. Charlotte had been bustled indoors and into a room that was the equivalent of an iron box and seated in a steel chair bolted to the floor, where she had waited alone for hours while someone - she was sure - tried to persuade Leon Metzger to burn her and be done with it.\\n\\n Peter Octavian was the only reason they hadn\u0027t killed her on the spot, and the reason that instead of burning her, Metzger had come into the iron box with two cups of coffee and sat down across from her.\\n\\n \u0027I know, it\u0027s a TV show cop cliche. But it\u0027s here if you want it. Actually, the coffee around here\u0027s pretty good,\u0027 he said, taking a sip as he slouched back in his chair.\\n\\n Charlotte hadn\u0027t hesitated. She\u0027d taken the coffee and swigged it, wishing for more sugar but relishing it just the same. A little bit of civilization in the midst of madness. And she hadn\u0027t spent a moment worrying about what kind of signal it might send that she was so willing to drink . . . to accept what he offered. Either he was playing some kind of head game with her or he wasn\u0027t; she couldn\u0027t bring herself to care.\\n\\n \u0027Thank you,\u0027 she had said, and she thought he\u0027d known she\u0027d meant it as gratitude for both the coffee and her life.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m not going to drag this out,\u0027 Metzger had said. \u0027Octavian says you can be trusted, and that\u0027s good enough for me. Whatever issues my predecessor had with him, I don\u0027t share them. So in a few minutes I\u0027m going to have someone come in and explain the Covenant to you and then you\u0027re going to sign it, both because you say you want to and also because if you don\u0027t, you won\u0027t leave here alive.\u0027\\n\\n The strangest part of that bit of interaction had been that when he\u0027d said it, Metzger had smiled in such an amiable way that Charlotte had smiled in return. She\u0027d found herself somewhat charmed by a man who had just threatened to kill her, and so she had told him that she had come there specifically to sign the Covenant and nearly been killed already by assassins who wanted to make sure that never happened. Metzger had turned thoughtful, then.\\n\\n Two soldiers - Song and Galleti, though she hadn\u0027t known their names at the time - had come in with a pen and a copy of the Covenant. Charlotte had only skimmed it, but she got enough of the gist. It wasn\u0027t hard to imagine what humans would want by way of promises from vampires. I won\u0027t hunt humans. I won\u0027t take blood without permission. I\u0027ll be a good little Shadow.\\n\\n Then the interrogation had begun, about Cortez and the killers who had been hunting her, about Octavian and how she\u0027d come to meet him, about what she\u0027d done while she\u0027d been answering to Cortez, and after. It had gone on for so long that she\u0027d lost track of time, until Sergeant Omondi had come in to interrupt his commander with news that he was needed on the phone. Metzger had been irritated, right up until Omondi told him it was Peter Octavian calling and that he\u0027d said it was urgent.\\n\\n Less than thirty minutes later, they\u0027d been boarding a helicopter, Charlotte and a handful of people who made their living hunting down vampires. Now here she was riding in the back of a chopper with them like she was somehow part of the team, and it felt like one of those dreams about going to school in your underwear. Charlotte had been vulnerable most of her life, and she didn\u0027t like it. She had been drugged and raped and murdered and transformed into a monster, and the only upside of all that horror was that people couldn\u0027t physically hurt her anymore. Medusa had taken that away and now Charlotte felt haunted and uneasy, acutely aware of every possible threat to her well-being.\\n\\n The thrum of the chopper pounding at her ears, she glanced out the small window beside her. The pilot had said the trip would take about forty minutes, so she figured the sprawling lights below must be the city of Philadelphia. That was good; it meant they would be landing soon. Thus far today her luck had been for shit - sort of par for the course of her life - but if it turned in her favor at all, she would never have to get on a helicopter again.\\n\\n \u0027You don\u0027t look good,\u0027 a voice called.\\n\\n Charlotte glanced up to see Metzger watching her with ice blue eyes. He arched a wiry gray eyebrow as if punctuating the comment, turning it into a query.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m fine,\u0027 she said.\\n\\n Metzger cocked his head to indicate he hadn\u0027t heard. With the roar of the rotors it was necessary for her to speak up.\\n\\n \u0027I said I\u0027m fine!\u0027\\n\\n He nodded, though he looked doubtful. \u0027Not hungry? When was the last time you fed?\u0027\\n\\n Charlotte winced at the question. Fed, not ate. Like an animal. A beast on the prowl. It shouldn\u0027t have surprised her to get this peek into the way Metzger saw her kind, but thus far he had treated her fairly humanely, so it did shock her a little. And how was she supposed to answer that, anyway? Yes, it had been a while since the last time she had had human blood to drink, but she would survive. She figured the most fundamental difference between the Shadows who lived in peace with humanity and those who chose to embrace the word \u0027vampire\u0027 was self-control. She chose to ignore Metzger\u0027s question, turning again to look out the window.\\n\\n She didn\u0027t hear him unsnap the rig that belted him into his seat, but she caught sight of the motion in the corner of her eye and turned back just as he grabbed hold of her wrist and crouched beside her seat. Charlotte glanced at the others. Barbieri had nodded off, but the three soldiers were alert with tension, watching their CO closely.\\n\\n \u0027Let\u0027s be clear,\u0027 Metzger said, squeezing her wrist for emphasis, gazing at her with those ice blue eyes. \u0027I\u0027m not just being hospitable. If you need blood, I will see that you get it, not because I\u0027m just that nice a guy but because I don\u0027t want you losing control and trying to drain one of my people. You might hurt somebody, and then we\u0027d have to kill you. Octavian would be pissed and nobody wants that. I don\u0027t want the guy turning me into a newt, right?\u0027\\n\\n He grinned as if this was a joke, but Charlotte could hear the truth in it.\\n\\n \u0027You still haven\u0027t told me why we\u0027re doing this,\u0027 she said. \u0027Octavian sent me to you and now you\u0027re bringing me back to him?\u0027\\n\\n Metzger gave a small shrug. \u0027It\u0027s Octavian\u0027s business. You\u0027ll learn soon enough. But I brought you along because he asked for you, and because I trust him. If I didn\u0027t trust him, I\u0027d have to kill him, and I\u0027m not quite sure how to go about it. So I don\u0027t really have a choice - I have to trust him. Don\u0027t get to thinking that extends to you, though. The last time the commander of Task Force Victor trusted a vampire, it didn\u0027t turn out too well.\u0027\\n\\n Charlotte scowled. Allison Vigeant had been a Bloodhound for Task Force Victor until its previous commander, Ray Henning, had gone kill-crazy and tried to take down every Shadow he saw, ally or enemy. Allison had put him down like a rabid dog, which was fairly close to the truth.\\n\\n \u0027What was it you were saying about blood?\u0027 she asked, raising her voice over the chopper noise. She smiled and her fangs slid out.\\n\\n Metzger hesitated, staring at her teeth. \u0027I see the Medusa toxin is starting to wear off.\u0027\\n\\n Charlotte ran her tongue over the sharp tips of her fangs. \u0027Sure looks like it.\u0027\\n\\n Metzger nodded slowly. \u0027When we\u0027re on the ground, I\u0027ll make a call to local law enforcement and set up a volunteer. There\u0027s always some freak who\u0027s willing to share.\u0027\\n\\n She didn\u0027t rise to the bait of his disdain. After a second, Metzger slid back into his seat and buckled himself into his restraints. The chopper began to yaw and pitch a little, in addition to the usual shuddering, and she glanced out the window to see the lights of the airport below, with trucks darting to and fro and the large H of a helipad looming closer.\\n\\n They were landing. Octavian would be waiting with answers, but for the first time, Charlotte wasn\u0027t sure she wanted them.\\n\\n There were cops in the hotel lobby, keeping an eye on everyone who came and went. Two uniformed officers stood near the elevator bank and checked the identification of everyone who went up or came down, keeping a log. Charlotte saw a pair of men in dark suits talking to a cop who looked like he must be a captain or a lieutenant or something, and figured the suits for FBI. Whatever had happened here, Octavian was right in the middle of it, and it had been significant enough to warrant this kind of attention. The nineteen-year-old girl in her wanted to make a run for it, but all of these grim-faced investigators with their guns and handcuffs weren\u0027t there looking for her. Besides that, she could feel the Medusa toxin wearing off, her ability to alter her flesh returning almost like an injured muscle regaining its limberness.\\n\\n Soon, if she wanted to get away from Metzger and his team, she\u0027d at least have a shot at making it before they hit her with another dose of the toxin. But before she took any action, she wanted to see Octavian and find out what this was all about.\\n\\n \u0027She has no ID,\u0027 Sergeant Omondi told the cops barring access to the elevators.\\n\\n \u0027Then she stays down here,\u0027 the older of the two cops said, lifting his chin in pride and defiance, wanting to make sure they knew who had jurisdiction.\\n\\n Galleti smirked, closing her eyes a moment.\\n\\n \u0027Something funny, Miss?\u0027 the older cop asked.\\n\\n Metzger shot Galleti a dark look. She stood up a bit straighter, no smile on her face now, chocolate brown eyes very serious. Omondi and Song followed suit, perfectly grim, but Barbieri shook his head in open pity for the uniformed policeman.\\n\\n \u0027This should be -\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Barbieri,\u0027 Metzger said, the warning clear in his tone.\\n\\n Then he turned back to the cops, who had already seen the identification of each member of the team from Task Force Victor.\\n\\n \u0027Officer, maybe you\u0027re not aware that Task Force Victor is charged with its duties under the United Nations amended charter, and has been given jurisdictional authority over all vampire-related incidents,\u0027 Metzger explained, feigning patience.\\n\\n The cop sniffed, shot a can-you-believe-this glance at his partner, and then cocked his head to look at Metzger as if he were an unusual animal on display at the zoo.\\n\\n \u0027Given I haven\u0027t been in a coma or on the moon, yeah, I\u0027m aware. But let me tell you what we\u0027ve got upstairs. A murder victim and a magic-man,\u0027 the cop said, waggling his fingers at the end, mocking the idea of magic. \u0027There\u0027s no vampire here.\u0027\\n\\n A chill went through Charlotte. Octavian had come to Philadelphia to reconnect with his girlfriend, now he was in a swanky hotel room with a corpse.\\n\\n \u0027Shit,\u0027 she whispered, \u0027it\u0027s not Nikki, is it?\u0027\\n\\n The cops both glanced at her, as did Barbieri. The soldiers did not.\\n\\n \u0027Your victim was killed by a vampire. The investigation is yours; that\u0027s not what we do. But you\u0027re bound by your own government\u0027s laws to cooperate with us. If you impede us - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Didn\u0027t say you couldn\u0027t go through, Van Helsing,\u0027 the cop said, then pointed at Charlotte. \u0027But she\u0027s got no ID, and my orders are clear. You want to cross swords over jurisdiction, that\u0027s fine, but until someone changes my orders-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027She\u0027s our new Bloodhound, you idiot,\u0027 Barbieri growled. \u0027She\u0027s a vampire!\u0027\\n\\n The cop laughed. \u0027Hell, that\u0027s not going to win you any points. You want her with you, go through channels. Get my lieutenant on the line and have him order me to let her pass. Until then, no go.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Points?\u0027 Metzger said, his patience frayed.\\n\\n His nostrils flared with anger. He cast a sidelong glance at Sergeant Omondi and gave a curt nod. With a clatter, Omondi, Song, and Galleti put their hands on the butts of their weapons but did not draw them. The younger cop, who looked like he might piss his pants, started to reach for his gun, but the older one shouted at him and grabbed his wrist to keep him from doing so.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re wasting my time,\u0027 Metzger said. \u0027Both of you step aside. One of you call your lieutenant. If he has a problem with us being here, he can damn well come up and tell us himself. He can tell Octavian. I have a feeling he won\u0027t want to do that. Now, cooperate or I take you into custody and we let the city of Philadelphia fight it out with the UN, if you think they\u0027ll even bother.\u0027\\n\\n Charlotte shuddered in disgust. \u0027Enough with the dick-waving contest,\u0027 she said, turning to the cop. \u0027You lose. Right now you\u0027re just trying to find a way to save face. Well there isn\u0027t one. Fucking get over it.\u0027\\n\\n The cop glared at her for a second, and then laughed. It wasn\u0027t a derisive laugh, more an appreciative chuckle. He put his hands up in surrender.\\n\\n \u0027All right, Commander. You and your team can take your ferocious vampire upstairs.\u0027\\n\\n The cops made way, letting them through, and aside from a cold bit of courtesy from Metzger, they were all silent as they waited for the elevator. Charlotte kept glancing around at their faces, but none of them looked back at her until they were on board, ascending toward the seventh floor.\\n\\n \u0027What the hell was that?\u0027 she said.\\n\\n Metzger watched the numbers light up. The others ignored her as the elevator passed the fifth floor with a ding. Finally she turned to Barbieri.\\n\\n \u0027They didn\u0027t believe you were a vampire,\u0027 he said. \u0027Young, pretty, mouth like a street kid.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I should eat his face,\u0027 Charlotte said, knitting her brow.\\n\\n \u0027You should,\u0027 Galleti muttered.\\n\\n Metzger shot her a withering glance that caused Galleti to stare straight ahead at the elevator doors.\\n\\n \u0027Sorry, sir,\u0027 Galleti said. \u0027I didn\u0027t mean literally.\u0027\\n\\n Charlotte threw up her hands. \u0027For fuck\u0027s sake, neither did I!\u0027\\n\\n Both Song and Galleti smiled at that. Sergeant Omondi remained stoic as ever. When the elevator dinged to a stop on Seven and the doors slid open, Metzger was the first one off and the others all followed in his wake. Barbieri made a flourishing bow and gestured for Charlotte to precede him.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s going to be an interesting day,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n Half a dozen other cops were in the corridor, either carrying crime scene equipment, taking statements at the doors of other guests\u0027 rooms, or standing guard at the entrance of one room. When Metzger and his team approached, the sentries just muttered a greeting and waved him through, and Charlotte figured the asshole downstairs had radioed up with a warning.\\n\\n The minute she walked into the hotel room, all of the trivial politics and posturing of the authorities was forgotten. She had smelled the blood as soon as they got off the elevator, but now the smell filled up her head, rich and powerful. Metzger had called ahead for a volunteer - someone to give her blood - but nobody had shown up for the job as yet. The Philadelphia police would have some on hand, as would any hospital, but she didn\u0027t think she was going to get any handouts here in the City of Brotherly Love. The hungry animal inside of her stirred in its sleep and she licked her lips and swallowed drily. This was a problem that needed solving, but not yet.\\n\\n A couple of plainclothes detectives stood inside the hotel room, which seemed crowded to Charlotte even before she heard Barbieri start bitching.\\n\\n \u0027What the hell is this?\u0027 the forensics expert asked, pushing ahead so he was just behind Metzger. \u0027You\u0027ve had the Macy\u0027s parade in here. How am I supposed to -\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Whoa, hold up,\u0027 one of the detectives said. \u0027The job is done, pal. CSU has been here and gone already. They just took away the last of their equipment. The scene\u0027s already been processed. Only thing still here that shouldn\u0027t be is the . . .\u0027\\n\\n He was about to say \u0027victim\u0027. They all knew it, could feel it, but he faltered and just let the sentence hang there unfinished. When the detectives turned to glance awkwardly back into the room, they could all see why.\\n\\n Peter Octavian lay on the bed, fully clothed, beside the body of Nikki Wydra, the woman he loved. He had stripped the sheet from the bed and swaddled her in it, wrapped her as if he\u0027d been preparing some Egyptian pharaoh for burial. He lay there beside her cocoon, studying her face with a longing that broke Charlotte\u0027s heart, unconcerned by the knowledge that there were witnesses to his anguish. Charlotte studied Nikki\u0027s face, the only part of her that was exposed. Even her lips were so pale they seemed made from alabaster.\\n\\n The awkwardness of the moment expanded until it filled the room. Charlotte lowered her gaze and half-turned away, wishing they would all have given Octavian his privacy. The mage looked terrible, his eyes rimmed with red, his hair mussed and his clothes rumpled.\\n\\n \u0027Goodbye, love,\u0027 Charlotte heard him say, and she glanced back in time to glimpse him brushing his lips against her forehead.\\n\\n Octavian climbed to his feet, cast a final look at Nikki\u0027s corpse, and then turned to the detectives. \u0027Finish your work. Let me know if you have any further questions and I\u0027ll do the same. Task Force Victor will need to be kept informed of your progress.\u0027\\n\\n These detectives weren\u0027t likely to appreciate being told what to do any more than the uniformed cops downstairs, but they weren\u0027t going to argue with this man.\\n\\n Octavian slid past the detectives, glanced once at Metzger, and then went to Charlotte. He took her hands and kissed her cheek, peering at her with those dark eyes.\\n\\n \u0027Thank you for coming,\u0027 he said, as if she\u0027d had a choice.\\n\\n Then he looked at the other members of Task Force Victor gathered there and nodded once in greeting before turning again to Metzger.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve secured us a room down the hall where we can talk,\u0027 Octavian said. \u0027Do what you need to do and let\u0027s get to it. The balance of things is shifting, and we need to act before it\u0027s shifted so far that it can\u0027t be righted again.\u0027\\n\\n Metzger ordered Barbieri to examine the crime scene, regardless of the fact that the Crime Scene Unit had already been and gone and many people had trampled through the room since then. The forensics man got to work immediately, putting the detectives on notice that he\u0027d want someone to take him to the police labs as soon as he was done there. Song stayed behind to assist him and to look out for him in the event that something went violently wrong. Where Shadows and the supernatural were concerned, it was always best to be careful.\\n\\n Octavian gestured for Charlotte to walk with him and she complied, the two of them leading Metzger, Sergeant Omondi, and Galleti down the corridor to the second to last door on the seventh floor. Charlotte expected him to produce a key card but instead he rapped lightly on the door in a certain rhythm, a signal knock, letting whoever was inside know it was him. She glanced at Metzger and saw him frowning in confusion.\\n\\n They heard the deadbolt click open and the chain on the door slide back, and then the door swung inward.\\n\\n The woman who stood there holding the door open looked incredibly familiar. Something was different about her, though, and it took Charlotte a second to realize that it was her hair. Once upon a time it had been a dark red and now it was a light brown, long and lush and veiling part of her face. But she knew the face.\\n\\n So, after a moment, did the soldiers from Task Force Victor.\\n\\n \u0027Holy -\u0027 Galleti began, drawing her gun.\\n\\n Metzger snatched up his own weapon, quick as a gunslinger, and in his eyes Charlotte saw death. She understood it, too. The woman was Allison Vigeant, who had murdered his predecessor - torn his throat out with her teeth. She had been Task Force Victor\u0027s most wanted for years.\\n\\n With a flick of his wrist, Octavian froze them where they stood. Their hands and weapons crackled with a silver, electric mist. He looked at them with a ferocity that would brook no argument.\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027re going to talk. All of us,\u0027 he said. \u0027Which means you\u0027re going to put your weapons away and you\u0027re going to listen. Do not make the mistake of thinking you have a choice.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Fine,\u0027 Metzger said, staring at Allison before he flicked his gaze toward Octavian. \u0027But whatever you\u0027ve got to say, it better be good.\u0027 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-graves-of-saints-shadow-saga-6/page-3.html","bookId":2601,"book":{"id":2601,"title":"The Graves of Saints (Shadow Saga #6)","description":"Storyline: The Graves of Saints (Shadow Saga #6) \\n For centuries, Vatican sorcerers kept demons and monsters out of our world with the magic found in a grimoire called The Gospel of Shadows. Years ago, to save his people from madmen, Peter Octavian defeated those sorcerers and the Gospel of Shadows itself was banished from the Earth. Ever since, the evils and monstrosities lurking in parallel worlds have been waking to the realization that our magical defences are down - the barriers keeping them out of our world are crumbling. \\n With massive demonic incursions in locations around the world, Octavian should be focused on using his own sorcery to drive the evil out and rebuild our defences. But a renegade vampire named Cortez has murdered the person Octavian loves the most and, even with his friends and allies around him, he is so lost in grief that he can think of nothing but revenge. There are others who can fight the darkness - mages and Shadows, witches and Reapers and vampire samurai - but only the warrior-mage, Peter Octavian, can defeat it. If he will answer the call.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-graves-of-saints-shadow-saga-6.jpg","author":"Christopher Golden","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-graves-of-saints-shadow-saga-6.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:55 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:28:06 PM"}}
