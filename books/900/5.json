{"id":13304,"no":5,"title":"CHAPTER IV. BACK AT SCHOOL.","content":"It was a long time after they had, with many breaks, read Edgar\u0027s letter to the end before Rupert and Madge could compose themselves sufficiently to accompany their father into the drawing-room. They again broke down when they met[Pg 66] their mother; and it was not until Captain Clinton said, \"Come, we must all pull ourselves together and see what is to be done, and talk the whole matter over calmly,\" that by a great effort they recovered their composure. \"Now, in the first place, we must try to find Edgar. He has got twenty-four hours\u0027 start of us, but that is not very much. I suppose you think, Rupert, that there is no doubt that he went up to town by the night train.\" \"I have no doubt that he got away in time to do so, father; but of course he might have gone by the down train, which passes through Gloucester somewhere about the same time.\" \"I do not think it likely that he did that, Rupert. I should say he was sure to go to London; that is almost always the goal people make for, unless it is in the case of boys who want to go to sea, when they would make for Liverpool or some other port. But I don\u0027t think Edgar was likely to do that. I don\u0027t think he had any special fancy for the sea; so we may assume that he has gone to London. What money had he?\" \"He had that five-pound note you sent three days ago, father, to clear off any ticks we had, and to pay our journey home. That is what he meant when he said, \u0027I have taken the note, but I know you won\u0027t grudge it me.\u0027 I think he had about a pound left—that is about what I had—and I know when the note came he said that the money he had was enough to last him to the end of the term. So he would have the five-pound note untouched when he got to London, and if driven to it he could get, I should think, six or seven pounds for his watch and chain.\" \"That would give him enough to keep him some little time. If he had been a couple of years older I should say that he would probably enlist at once, as you had both made up your minds to go into the army. But although lads do enlist under the proper age, no recruiting officer or doctor would pass him as being eighteen. The first thing to do will be to advertise for him—in the first place to advertise offering[Pg 67] a reward for information as to his whereabouts, and in the second place advertising to him direct, begging him to come home.\" \"But he would never come, father,\" Rupert said, looking at the letter, which Captain Clinton still held in his hand. \"It would depend how we advertised. Suppose I were to say, \u0027Statement of woman not believed; we are in as much doubt as before.\u0027\" The others looked up in intense surprise. \"Oh, father, how could you say that?\" Rupert exclaimed. \"Oh, if we could but say so! I should be quite, quite content to know that either of us might be her son—that would not matter so much if we felt that you loved us both equally; but how could you say so?\" \"Because, Rupert,\" Captain Clinton said gravely, \"I still think there is great ground for doubt.\" \"Do you really, father? Oh, I am pleased! I think—yes, I am sure that I could bear now to know that Edgar is your real son, and not I. It would be so different to learn it from your lips, to know that you all love me still, instead of hearing it in the dreadful way Edgar did. But how do you doubt, father? It seemed to me from reading the letter so certain.\" \"Do you really doubt, Percy?\" Mrs. Clinton asked. \"I do indeed, Lucy; and I will give you my reasons. In the first place, this woman left India a few weeks after the affair. She certainly could not have seen the children until we returned to England, and, so far as we know, has never seen them since. If she has seen them, she never can have spoken to them or come in any sort of contact with them, therefore she cannot possibly have known which is which. When she saw them at Cheltenham, and Rupert says that she was there more than a week, she met them upon every possible occasion and stared hard at them. It is evident, therefore, that she was for all that time doubtful. No doubt she was doing what we used to do, trying to detect a resemblance. Now, if we in all these years[Pg 68] with the boys, constantly watching their ways and listening to their voices, could detect no resemblance, it is extremely improbable that she was able to do so from merely seeing them a score of times walking in the streets. I do not say that it is impossible she could have done so; I only say it is extremely improbable; and I think it much more likely that, finding she could see no resemblance whatever, she determined to speak to the first whom she might happen to find alone.\" \"But there is the mark, father,\" Rupert said. \"Yes, there is the mark,\" Mrs. Clinton repeated. \"I did not know you had a mark, Rupert. I wonder we never noticed it, Lucy.\" \"It is a very tiny one, father. I never noticed it myself—indeed I can hardly see it before a glass, for it is rather at the back of the shoulder—until Edgar noticed it one day. It is not larger than the head of a good-sized pin. It is a little dark-brown mole. Perhaps it was smaller and lighter when I was a baby; but it must have been there then, or she would not have known about it.\" \"That is so, Rupert; but the mere fact that it is there does not in any way prove that you are our son. Just see what Edgar says about it in his letter. Remember the woman could not have known which of you boys had the mark; and that she did not know, that is to say, that she had not recognized the likeness, appears from Edgar\u0027s letter. This is what he says: \u0027She said that one of us had a small mole on the shoulder. I knew that Rupert had a tiny mole there; and she said that was the mark by which she knew your son from hers.\u0027 Suppose Edgar had replied, \u0027Yes, I have such a mark on my shoulder,\u0027 might she not have said, that is the mark by which I can distinguish my son from that of Captain Clinton?\" The others were silent. Then Mrs. Clinton said, \"You know, Percy, I do not wish to prove that one more than the other of the boys is ours; but naturally the woman would wish to benefit her own boy, and if it had been her own boy[Pg 69] who had the mark, why should she not have told Edgar that she had made a mistake, and that it was Rupert who was her son?\" \"I do not suppose, Lucy, that she cared in the slightest which was her son; her main object, of course, was to extort money. Edgar does not say anything at all about that; and of course at first she would try and make out that she was ready to sacrifice herself for him, and would scarcely say that she expected him to make her a handsome allowance when he came into the property, but I have no doubt that was her motive. Well, you see, she had already begun with Edgar. Suppose she said that she had made a mistake, and Rupert was her son. Edgar would have gone in and told him, and would probably have telegraphed to me, so that I could get to Rupert before this woman saw him, and she would have known then that her story would have been upset altogether. No court of law would attach any weight to what she might say. She would have to stand confessed as having been concerned in a gross fraud, and with having lied at first; and unless she was in a position to produce corroborative evidence to prove that her child had this mark, her word would go for nothing. \"Now, I feel sure that she could produce no such evidence. The mark was almost an invisible one, for it was never afterwards noticed. Had she shown it to any of the women of her acquaintance, they would have come forward when the change of children took place, and have pointed out that the children could be easily distinguished, inasmuch as my child had a peculiar mark. I feel sure that even her husband knew nothing about this mark, for I don\u0027t believe he was a party to the fraud. He was terribly upset by the whole business, and took to drink afterwards. There were continual quarrels between his wife and himself, and she left him and went to England. I believe if he could have pointed out which was my child and which was his own, he would have done so. \"Certainly, I myself should have attached little or no weight[Pg 70] to this woman\u0027s story if she had come here with it. I should have turned her out of the house, and have told her to go to a court if she dare and claim the custody of her son. She must have known the weakness of her own position, and as I say, having once opened the matter to Edgar, she determined to stick to it, knowing that a boy taken thus on a sudden would be likely to believe her, whereas if she said that you were her son she would find you already prepared and probably have to confront me too. So you see, Rupert, I can truthfully advertise—\u0027Woman\u0027s story not believed; we are in as much doubt as before; both are regarded by us as our sons.\u0027\" \"I am glad, father!\" Rupert exclaimed excitedly. \"Oh! if Edgar had but written to you first, instead of going straight away.\" \"It would have been better,\" Captain Clinton said, \"but I cannot blame him. I think it was natural that he should go as he did. He would have thought that had he written to me it would have seemed as if he wanted something from me, and anything would have seemed better to him than that. However, we must set about doing something at once. I shall go by the nine o\u0027clock local to Swindon, and on by the night mail to town. Then I shall set a detective at work. He may find out from the porters if anyone noticed a lad arrive by the night mail this morning, and shall draw up carefully-worded advertisements. I shall write to Mr. River-Smith before I start. What would you like, Rupert—to go back to-morrow, or to stay away until the end of the term? If you take my advice, you will go back; it would be a pity for you to miss your examinations.\" \"I don\u0027t think I could get through the examinations, father, with this on my mind; besides, what should I say to the fellows about Edgar\u0027s going away? You see, if we find him before next term begins, we need say nothing about it.\" \"You would have to account for his having run away, Rupert, anyhow. I think you had better go back, my boy,[Pg 71] and tell the facts of the story. There is not the slightest discredit in it, and it would be better for Edgar himself that it should be known that he went under the influence of a mistake than that all sorts of reasons should be assigned for his absence. There will, of course, be no occasion to go into full details. You would tell the story of the confusion that arose as to the children, and say that Edgar had received some information which led him erroneously to conclude that the problem was solved, and that he was not my son, and that therefore he had run away so as to avoid receiving any further benefits from the mistake that had been made.\" \"Perhaps that would be best, father. Indeed I don\u0027t know what I should do if I were to stop here now with nothing to do but to worry about him.\" \"I am sure it will be best, Rupert. I will tell your master you will return to-morrow afternoon.\" Captain Clinton went up to town by the night mail, and in the morning went to a private detective\u0027s office. After giving particulars of Edgar\u0027s age and appearance he went on: \"As he had no luggage with him, and there was nothing particular about his personal appearance, I consider it altogether useless to search for him in London; but I think it possible that he may try to enlist.\" \"Sixteen is too young for them to take him, unless he looks a good deal older than he is.\" \"Yes, I quite see that. At the same time that is the only thing that occurs to us as likely for him to try.\" \"Not likely to take to the sea, sir?\" \"Not at all likely from what we know of his fancies. Still he might do that for a couple of years with a view to enlisting afterwards.\" \"How about going to the States or Canada?\" \"That again is quite possible.\" \"Had he money with him, sir?\" \"He had about five pounds in his pocket, and a gold watch[Pg 72] and chain that he had only had a few months, and could, I should think, get seven or eight pounds for; but I do not see what he could do to get his living if he went abroad.\" \"No, sir; but then young gents always have a sort of fancy that they can get on well out there, and if they do not mind what they turn to I fancy that most of them can. Is he in any trouble, sir? You will excuse my asking, but a young chap who gets into trouble generally acts in a different sort of way to one who has gone out what we may call venturesome.\" \"No, he has got into no trouble,\" Captain Clinton said. \"He has gone away under a misunderstanding, but there is nothing whatever to make him wish to conceal himself beyond the fact that he will do all he can to prevent my tracing him at present. Here are half a dozen of his photos. If you want more I can get them struck off.\" \"I could do with another half-dozen,\" the man said. \"I will send them down to men who act with me at Southampton, Hull, Liverpool, Glasgow, and Plymouth, and will send two or three abroad. He might cross over to Bremen or Hamburg, a good many go that way now. I will look after the recruiting offices here myself; but as he is only sixteen, and as you say does not look older, I do not think there is a chance of his trying that. No recruiting sergeant would take him up. No, sir; I should say that if he has no friends he can go to, the chances are he will try to ship for the States or Canada. But what are we to do if we find him?\" Captain Clinton had not thought of this. \"Of course,\" the man went on, \"if you gave an authority for me to send down to each of my agents, they could take steps to stop him.\" \"No,\" Captain Clinton said after a pause, during which he had been thinking that as he could not swear that Edgar was his son, he was in fact powerless in the matter. \"No, I do not wish that done. I have no idea whatever of coercing him. I[Pg 73] want, if possible, to see him and converse with him before he goes. If that is not possible, and if he is not found until just as the ship is sailing, then I want your agent to wire to me the name of the steamer in which he goes and the port to which it sails. Then if there is a faster steamer going, I might be there as soon as he is; if not, I should wish you to telegraph to a private detective firm across the water, which I suppose you could do, to have somebody to meet the steamer as she came in, and without his knowing it to keep him under his eye until I arrive.\" \"I could manage all that, sir, easily enough. I will send off four of the photographs at once to the ports and the others as soon as I get them, and will go down with the other photograph to the recruiting office and arrange with one of the sergeants engaged there to let me know if he turns up, and will send a man down to the docks to watch the ships there. I will send off the other photos directly I get them.\" There was nothing else for Captain Clinton to do, but before he returned home he wrote out a series of advertisements and left them at the offices of the principal papers. They ran as follows:—\"If E.C., who left Cheltenham suddenly, will return home he will find that he has acted under a misapprehension. The woman\u0027s story was untrustworthy. He is still regarded as a son by P.C. and L.C.\" Having done this he drove to Paddington, and went down by an afternoon train. Rupert arrived at Cheltenham just as the others had sat down to tea. \"Hullo, Clinton! Back again, eh? Glad to see you.\" Rupert nodded a reply to the greeting. His heart was too full to speak, and he dropped into the seat he was accustomed to use, the others moving up closely to make room for him. A significant glance passed between the boys. They saw that Edgar was not with him, and guessed that there was something wrong. There had been a good deal of wonder among them at the Clintons\u0027 sudden disappearance, and although several of[Pg 74] the boys had seen Rupert go into his brother\u0027s dormitory none had seen Edgar, and somehow or other it leaked out that Rupert had started in a cab to the station alone. There had been a good deal of quiet talk among the seniors about it. All agreed that there was something strange about the matter, especially as Robert, when questioned on the subject, had replied that Mr. River-Smith\u0027s orders were that he was to say nothing about it. As a precautionary measure orders were given to the juniors that no word about the Clintons\u0027 absence was to be said outside the house. After tea was over Rupert went up to Pinkerton. \"Pinkerton, I should like to have a talk with you and Easton and two or three others—Skinner, and Mossop, and Templer—yes, and Scudamore.\" \"Just as you like, Clinton. Of course if you like to tell us anything we shall be glad to hear it, but we all know that your brother was not the sort of fellow to get into any dishonourable sort of scrape, and I can promise you we shall ask no questions if you would rather keep the matter altogether to yourself.\" \"No, I would rather tell you,\" Rupert said. \"I know none of you would think that Edgar would have done anything wrong, but all sorts of stories are certain to go about, and I would rather that the truth of the matter were known. You are the six head fellows of the house, and when I have told you the story you can do as you like about its going further.\" \"Well, if you go up to my study,\" Pinkerton said, \"I will bring the others up.\" In three or four minutes the party were gathered there. \"Look here, Clinton,\" Easton said, \"Pinkerton says he has told you that we are all sure that, whatever this is all about, your brother has done nothing he or you need be ashamed about. I should like to say the same thing, and if it is painful for you to tell it do not say anything about it. We shall be quite content to know that he has left, if he has left—although[Pg 75] I hope we shall see him again next term for some good reason or other.\" \"No, I would rather tell it,\" Rupert said. \"It is a curious story, and a very unpleasant one for us, but there is nothing at all for us to be ashamed about.\" And he went on to tell them the whole story, ending with \"You see, whether Edgar or I am the son of Captain Clinton, or of this sergeant and his scheming wife, is more than we can say.\" \"It does not matter a bit to us,\" Easton said, breaking the silence of surprise with which they had listened to the story. \"We like you and your brother for yourselves, and it does not matter a rap to us, nor as far as I can see to anyone else, who your fathers and mothers were.\" \"I call it horribly hard lines for you both,\" Skinner put in; \"deuced hard lines, especially for your brother.\" Pinkerton said: \"By what you say Captain Clinton and his wife don\u0027t care now which is their real son; one is real and the other adopted, and as they regard you in the same light they don\u0027t even want to know which is which. Well, now you know that, it seems to me you are all right anyhow. You see your brother didn\u0027t know that, and when this woman told him she was his mother, and that the whole thing had been a preconcerted plot on her part, I can quite understand his going straight away. I think we should all have done the same if we had had the same story told to us, and had seen we were intended to be parties to a fraud of that sort. Well, I am glad you told us, but I do not think there is any occasion for the story to go further.\" \"Certainly not,\" Easton agreed, \"it would do no good whatever; and of course it would never be kept in the house, but would come to be the talk of the whole school. All that need be said is that Clinton has told us the reason of his brother leaving so suddenly, that we are all of opinion that he acted perfectly rightly in doing so, and that nothing more is to be said about the matter. We will each give Clinton our word[Pg 76] of honour not to give the slightest hint to anyone about it, or to say that it is a curious story or anything of that sort, but just to stick to it that we have heard all about it and are perfectly satisfied.\" \"That will certainly be the best plan,\" Pinkerton agreed; \"but I think it would be as well for us to say he has left for family reasons, and that it is nothing in any way connected with himself, and that we hope that he will be back again next term.\" \"Yes, we might say that,\" Easton agreed; \"family reasons mean all sorts of things, and anyone can take their choice out of them. Well, Clinton, I shouldn\u0027t worry over this more than you can help. I daresay Edgar will be found in a day or two. At any rate you may be sure that no harm has come to him, or is likely to come to him. If he emigrates, or anything of that sort, he is pretty safe to make his way, and I am sure that whatever he is doing he will always be a gentleman and a good fellow.\" \"That he will,\" Mossop said cordially. \"I hope we should all have done as he has under the same circumstances, but it would be a big temptation to some fellows to have the alternative of a good fortune and a nice estate on one side, and of going out into the world and making your own living how you can on the other.\" There was a chorus of assent. \"Yes,\" Easton said, \"it is very easy to say \u0027Do what is right and never mind what comes of it;\u0027 but we should all find it very hard to follow it in practice if we had a choice like that before us. Well, you tell your brother when you hear of him, Clinton, that we all think better of him than before, and that whether he is a sergeant\u0027s son or a captain\u0027s we shall welcome him heartily back, and be proud to shake his hand.\" And so it was settled, and to the great disappointment of the rest of the house no clue was forthcoming as to the cause of Edgar Clinton leaving so suddenly; but as the monitors and[Pg 77] seniors all seemed perfectly satisfied with what they had heard, it was evident to the others that whatever the cause might be he was not to blame in the matter. During the short time that remained of the term Rupert got on better than he had expected. While the examination was going on Easton invited him to do his work in his private study, gave him his advice as to the passages likely to be set, and coached him up in difficult points, and he came out higher in his form than he had expected to do. Three days before the school broke up Easton said: \"Clinton, I have had a letter from my father this morning, and he will be very glad if you will come down to spend the holidays at our place. And so shall I. There is very good hunting round us. My father has plenty of horses in his stables, and I expect we shall be rather gay, for my brother comes of age in the week after Christmas, and there is going to be a ball and so on. I don\u0027t know how you feel about it, but I should say that it would be better for you than being at home where everything will call your brother to your mind, and your being there will make it worse for the others.\" \"I am very much obliged to you, Easton; I should like it very much. I will write off to the governor at once and hear what he says. They might like to have me home, and possibly I might be useful in the search for Edgar. As I have told you, I feel sure that he has enlisted. He would be certain to change his name, and it would be no use anyone who did not know him going to look at the recruits.\" \"But we agreed, Clinton, that no one would enlist him at his age, and he is altogether too old to go as a band-boy.\" \"Yes, I know that; and that is what worries me more than anything. Still I cannot help thinking that he will try some how to get into the army. If he can\u0027t, I believe he will do anything he can to get a living until they enlist him.\" \"I don\u0027t think he can anyhow pass as eighteen, Clinton. If it was for anything else he might get up with false moustache or[Pg 78] something; but you see he has got to pass a strict examination by a surgeon. I have heard that lots of fellows do enlist under age, but then some fellows look a good bit older than they are. I don\u0027t believe any doctor would be humbugged into believing that Edgar is anything like eighteen.\" \"Well, I will write to my father this afternoon and hear what he says. If he thinks I cannot do any good and they don\u0027t want me at home, I shall be very pleased to come to you.\" Captain Clinton\u0027s letter came by return of post. He said that he was very pleased Rupert had had an invitation that would keep him away. \"We have received no news whatever of Edgar, and I don\u0027t think that it would be of any use for you to join in the search for him. There is no saying where he may have gone or what he may be doing. I agree with you that he will most likely take any job that offers to keep him until he can enlist. Arrangements have been made with one of the staff sergeants at the head-quarters of recruiting in London to let us know if any young fellow answering to Edgar\u0027s description comes up to be medically examined. So we shall catch him if he presents himself there. Unfortunately there are such a number of recruiting dep?ts all over the country, that there is no saying where he may try to enlist—that is, if he does try. However, at present there is certainly nothing you can do. I should like to have you home, and your mother says she should like you too, but I do think that for her sake it is better you should not come. As long as you are away there is nothing to recall at every moment the fact that Edgar has gone, whereas if you were here his absence would be constantly be before her. She is quite ill with anxiety, and Dr. Wilkinson agrees with me that change is most desirable. I am sure she would not hear of going away if you were at home; it would give her a good excuse for staying here; but when she hears that you are not coming I think I may be able to persuade her to listen to Wilkinson\u0027s opinion, and in[Pg 79] that case I shall take her and Madge down to Nice at once. If I can get her there by Christmas so much the better, for Christmas at home would be terribly trying to us all. Once we are there, we can wander about for two or three months in Italy or Spain, or across to Algeria or Egypt—anything to distract her mind.\" Accordingly Rupert accepted Easton\u0027s invitation, and went with him to his father\u0027s in Leicestershire. Had it not been for the uncertainty about Edgar he would have enjoyed his holidays greatly. Although he had always joined to a certain extent in the chaff of his school-fellows at Easton\u0027s care about his dress and little peculiarities of manner, he had never shared in Skinner\u0027s prejudices against him, and always said that he could do anything well that he chose to turn his hand to, and had appreciated his readiness to do a kindness to anyone who really needed it. It had been his turn now, and the friendly companionship of the elder boy had been of the greatest value to him. Easton had never said much in the way of sympathy, which indeed would have jarred Rupert\u0027s feelings, but his kindness had said more than words could do; and Rupert, as he looked back, felt ashamed at the thought that he had often joined in a laugh about him. At home the points that had seemed peculiar at school were unnoticeable. The scrupulous attention to dress that had there been in strong contrast to the general carelessness of the others in that respect, seemed but natural in his own house, where there were a good many guests staying. Rupert and Edgar had always been more particular at home than at school; but Easton was the same, indeed Rupert thought that he was if anything less particular now than he had been at River-Smith\u0027s. A week after Christmas Rupert received a letter from his father, written at Nice, saying that a letter from Edgar had been forwarded on from home, and giving the brief words in which the lad said that he was well, and that they might be[Pg 80] under no uneasiness respecting him. \"This does not tell us much,\" Captain Clinton went on, \"but we are very pleased, inasmuch as it seems that Edgar does not mean altogether to drop out of our sight, but will, we hope, write from time to time to let us know that at any rate he is well. The letter has the London post-mark, but of course that shows nothing; it may have been written anywhere and sent to anyone—perhaps to a waiter at an hotel at which he stopped in London, and with whom he had arranged to post any letters that he might inclose to him. The letter has greatly cheered your mother, who, in spite of all I could say, has hitherto had a dread that Edgar in his distress might have done something rash. I have never thought so for an instant. I trust that my two boys are not only too well principled, but too brave to act a coward\u0027s part, whatever might befall them. Your mother, of course, agreed with me in theory; but while she admitted that Edgar would never if in his senses do such a thing, urged that his distress might be so great that he would not be responsible for what he was doing. Happily this morbid idea has been dissipated by the arrival of the letter, and I have great hopes now that she will rouse herself, and will shake off the state of silent brooding which has been causing me so much anxiety. It was but this morning that we received the letter, and already she looks brighter and more like herself than she has done since you brought us the news of Edgar\u0027s disappearance.\" This news enabled Rupert to enjoy the remainder of the holidays much more than he had done the first fortnight. He and Edgar had both been accustomed to ride since they had been children, and had in their Christmas holidays for years accompanied their father to the hunting field, at first upon ponies, but the previous winter on two light-weight carrying horses he had bought specially for them. Mr. Easton had several hunters, and Rupert, who was well mounted, thoroughly enjoyed the hunting, and returned to school with his nerves braced up, ready for work.[Pg 81] \"I won\u0027t say anything against Easton again,\" Skinner said when he heard from Rupert how pleasant his holidays had been made for him. \"I noticed how he took to you and made things smooth for you the last ten days of the term, and I fully meant to tell him that I was sorry I had not understood him better before; only, in the first place, I never happened to have a good opportunity, and in the second place I don\u0027t know that I ever tried to make one. However, I shall tell him now. It is not a pleasant thing to be obliged to own that you have behaved badly, but it is a good deal more unpleasant to feel it and not have the pluck to say so.\" Accordingly the next time Easton came into the senior study, Skinner went up to him and said: \"Easton, I want to tell you that I am uncommonly sorry that I have set myself against you because you have been more particular about your dress and things than the rest of us, and because you did not seem as keen as we were about football and things. I know that I have behaved like an ass, and I should like to be friends now if you will let me.\" \"Certainly I will, Skinner,\" Easton said, taking the hand he held out. \"I don\u0027t know that it was altogether your fault. My people at home are rather particular about our being tidy and that sort of thing, and when I came here and some of you rather made fun of me about it, I think that I stuck to it all the more because it annoyed you. I shall be going up for Sandhurst this term, and I am very glad to be on good terms with all you fellows before I leave; so don\u0027t let us say anything more about it.\" And with another shake of the hands their agreement to be friends was ratified. The term between Christmas and Easter was always the dullest of the year. The house matches at football were over. Although a game was sometimes played, there was but a languid interest in it. Paper-chases were the leading incident in the term, and there was a general looking forward to spring[Pg 82] weather, when cricket could begin and the teams commence practice for the matches of the following term. Easton was going up in the summer for the examination for the line. He was not troubling himself specially about it; and indeed his getting in was regarded as a certainty, for Mr. Southley had said that he would be safe for the Indian Civil if he chose to try, and considered it a great pity that he was going up for so comparatively an easy competition as that for the line. He occasionally went for a walk with Rupert, and while chatting with him frequently about Edgar, was continually urging him not to let his thoughts dwell too much upon it, but to stick to his work. The watch at the various ports had long since been given up, for had Edgar intended to emigrate he would certainly have done so very shortly after his arrival in London, as his means would not have permitted him to make any stay there. \"I think it is very thoughtful of Edgar,\" Easton said one day when Rupert told him that he had heard from his father that another letter had arrived. \"So many fellows when they run away or emigrate, or anything of that sort, drop writing altogether, and do not seem to give a thought to the anxiety those at home are feeling for them. He is evidently determined that he will go his own way and accept no help from your people, and under the circumstances I can quite enter into his feelings; but, you see, he does not wish them to be anxious or troubled about him, and I don\u0027t think there is anything for you to worry about, Clinton. He may be having a hardish time of it; still he is no doubt getting his living somehow or other, and I don\u0027t know that it will do him any harm. \"I think he is the sort of fellow to make his way in whatever line he takes up, and though what he has learnt here may not be of much use to him at the start, his having had a good education is sure to be of advantage to him afterwards. A fellow who could hold his own in a tussle such as we had with the Greenites last term can be trusted to make a good fight in[Pg 83] anything. At any rate it is of no use your worrying yourself about him. You see, you will be going up in a year\u0027s time for your examination for the line, and you will have to stick to it pretty steadily if you are to get through at the first trial. It won\u0027t help matters your worrying about him, and wherever he is and whatever he is doing he is sure to keep his eye on the lists, and he will feel just as much pleasure in seeing your name there as he would have done if he had been here with you. So I should say, work steadily and play steadily. You have a good chance of being in the college boat next term; that and shooting will give you enough to do. \"It is no use sticking to it too hard. I was telling Skinner yesterday he will regularly addle his brain if he keeps on grinding as he is doing now. But it is of no use talking to Skinner; when his mind is set on a thing he can think of nothing else. Last term it was football, now it is reading. It must be an awful nuisance to be as energetic as he is. I cannot see why he should not take life comfortably.\" \"He would say,\" Rupert laughed, \"he cannot see why he should do things by fits and starts as you do, Easton.\" \"Ah! but I do not do it on principle,\" Easton argued. \"I am all for taking it quietly, only sometimes one gets stirred up and has to throw one\u0027s self into a thing. One does it, you know, but one feels it a nuisance—an unfair wear and tear of the system.\" \"Your system does not seem to suffer seriously, Easton.\" \"No; but it might if one were called upon to do these things often. But it is time for us to turn back, or we shall be late for tea.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3124/85917.html","bookId":900,"book":{"id":900,"title":"The Dash for Khartoum","description":"简介： The story of the Nile Expedition is so recent that no word of introduction is necessary to the historical portion of the tale.
