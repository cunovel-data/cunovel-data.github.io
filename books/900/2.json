{"id":13301,"no":2,"title":"CHAPTER I MIXED!","content":"I n a room in the married non-commissioned officers\u0027 quarters in the cantonments at Agra, a young woman was sitting looking thoughtfully at two infants, who lay sleeping together on the outside of a bed with a shawl thrown lightly over them. Jane Humphreys had been married about a year. She was the daughter of the regimental sergeant-major, and had been a spoilt child. She was good looking, and had, so the wives and daughters of the other non-commissioned officers said, laid herself out to catch one of the young officers of the regiment, and was bitterly disappointed at the failure of her efforts. The report may have been untrue, for Jane Farran was by no means popular with the other women, taking far too much upon herself, as they considered, upon the strength of her father\u0027s rank, and giving herself airs as if she were better than those around her. There were girls in the regiment just as good looking as she was without any of her airs and tempers. Why should she set herself up above the rest? When, however, Sergeant-major Farran died suddenly of[Pg 12] sunstroke after a heavy field-day, whatever plans and hopes his daughter may have entertained came to an end. Her name and that of her mother were put down among the women to be sent, with the next batch of invalids, home to England, and she suddenly accepted the offer of marriage of young Sergeant Humphreys, whose advances she had previously treated with scorn. They were married six weeks later, on the day before her mother was to go down by train with a party of invalids to Calcutta. The universal opinion of the women in the regiment was that the sergeant had got a bad bargain. \"No man of spirit,\" one of them said, \"would have taken up with a girl who only accepted him because she could not do any better. She has got her temper written in her face, and a nice time of it he is likely to have.\" It may have been true that Jane Humphreys had during her father\u0027s lifetime had her ambitions, but she was a clever woman and adapted herself to her circumstances. If, as the sergeant-major\u0027s daughter, she had given herself airs, and had thrown herself in the way of the young officers, and had been light and flighty in her manner, all this was changed as soon as she was married, and even the most censorious were obliged to admit that she made Sergeant Humphreys a better wife than they had expected. His home was admirably kept, the gay dresses that had been somewhat beyond her station were cut up and altered, and she dressed neatly and quietly. She was handy with her fingers, her things always fitted her well, and she gained the approbation of the officers\u0027 wives, who had previously looked upon her with some disfavour as a forward young person. She made every effort to get on good terms with the wives of the other non-commissioned officers, and succeeded at last in overcoming the prejudice which, as Jane Farran, she had excited. There was no doubt that she was a clever woman, and it was equally beyond doubt that she completely managed her husband. She was much his superior in education, and possessing far greater abilities could twist[Pg 13] him round her little finger, although she did it so cleverly that he never suspected that he was the victim of such an operation. A month previous to the opening of the story she had been confined of a boy, and two days later Mrs. Clinton, the wife of the captain of her husband\u0027s company, also became a mother. Before the week was over Mrs. Clinton was taken dangerously ill, and as it was impossible for her to nurse her child, the surgeon of the regiment recommended that it should be given into the charge of the sergeant\u0027s wife, as she, being a strong and healthy young woman, could very well nurse it as well as her own. It was a month after this that Sergeant Humphreys, returning to his quarters, found his wife sitting by the side of the bed on which the two infants were asleep. \"They are as alike as two peas,\" he said as he looked at them. \"I am sure I wonder, Jane, that you know which is which!\" Mrs. Humphreys\u0027 answer did not seem to the point. \"Captain Clinton is a rich man, is he not, John?\" \"Yes; they say he came into a grand estate two years ago when his father died, and that like enough he will leave the regiment when it goes home next year.\" \"Then one of those babies will be a rich man, and the other—\" and she stopped. \"The other will, I hope, be a non-commissioned officer in the 30th Foot one of these days,\" the sergeant said. Jane looked up at her husband. There was no touch of envy or discontent in his voice. She was about to speak but checked herself. \"Which is yours, John?\" she asked a moment later, returning to his first remark. \"I am sure I could not tell,\" he said with a laugh. \"Babies are mostly pretty much alike, and as these two are just the same age, and just the same size, and have both got gray eyes and light coloured hair—if you can call it hair,—and no noses to speak of, I don\u0027t see a pin\u0027s point of difference.\" A month later a small party were assembled in Captain[Pg 14] Clinton\u0027s bungalow. Mrs. Humphreys was standing with a baby in each arm. Mrs. Clinton was lying upon a sofa crying bitterly. Captain Clinton was walking up and down the room, hot and angry. The surgeon of the regiment was standing grave and sympathetic by Mrs. Clinton. Sergeant Humphreys was in the attitude of attention by the door, with an anxious troubled expression on his face. \"What in the world is to be done, doctor?\" Captain Clinton asked. \"I never heard of such a thing, it is a most serious business.\" \"I can quite see that,\" the doctor replied. \"When Mrs. Humphreys came to me and asked me to break the news to you, I told her at once that it was a terrible business. I own that I do not see that she is altogether to blame, but it is a most unfortunate occurrence. As I have just told you, she had, when she put the children to bed, put your child in one of her baby\u0027s night-gowns, as it happened there were none of your child\u0027s clean. In the morning she took them out and laid them on a rug on the ground before beginning to wash and dress them. She went out to the canteen to get something for her husband\u0027s breakfast, and when she returned she could not remember the order in which she had taken them out of bed and laid them down, and could not distinguish her own child from yours.\" \"You must remember, Mrs. Humphreys,\" Captain Clinton broke in; \"think it over, woman. You must remember how you laid them down.\" \"Indeed, I do not, sir; I have been thinking all the morning. I had nursed them two or three times during the night, and of course had changed their position then. I never thought about their having the same night-gowns on. If I had, of course I should have been more careful, for I have said to my husband over and over again that it was only by their clothes that I should know them apart, for if they had been twins they could not be more alike.[Pg 15] \"This is downright maddening!\" Captain Clinton exclaimed, pacing up and down the room. \"And is there no mark nor anything by which they can be recognized? Why, bless me, woman, surely you as a mother ought to know your own child!\" Mrs. Humphreys shook her head. \"I have nursed them both, sir, and which is mine and which is yours I could not say to save my life.\" \"Well, put the children down on that sofa,\" Captain Clinton said, \"and take yourself off for the present; you have done mischief enough for a lifetime. I will let you know what we decide upon later on.\" \"Well, doctor, what on earth is to be done?\" he asked after the door had closed upon the sergeant and his wife. \"What do you think had best be done, Lucy?\" But Mrs. Clinton, who was but just recovering from her illness, was too prostrated by this terrible blow to be able to offer any suggestion. \"It is a terrible business indeed, Clinton,\" the doctor said, \"and I feel for you most deeply. Of course the possibility of such a thing never entered my mind when I recommended you to let Mrs. Humphreys act as its foster-mother. It seemed at the time quite a providential circumstance that she too should be just confined, and in a position to take to your baby. The only possible suggestion I can offer is that you should for a time bring up both boys as your own. At present they are certainly wonderfully alike, but it is probable that as they grow up you will see in one or other of them a likeness to yourself or your wife, and that the other will take after its own parents. Of course these likenesses do not always exist, but in nine cases out of ten some resemblance can be traced between a boy and one or other of his parents.\" \"That certainly seems feasible,\" Captain Clinton said in a tone of relief. \"What do you say, dear? It is only bringing up the two children for a time till we are able to be certain[Pg 16] which is our own. The other will have had the advantage of a good education and so on, and of course it will be our business to give him a good start in life.\" \"It will be awful having the two children, and not knowing which is our own.\" \"It will be very unpleasant,\" Captain Clinton said soothingly; \"but, you see, in time you will come to care for them both just as if they had been twins.\" \"That will be almost as bad,\" Mrs. Clinton cried feebly. \"And suppose one gets to love the wrong one best?\" \"We won\u0027t suppose that, dear; but if we love them both equally, we will, when we find out which is ours, treat the other as an adopted child and complete his education, and start him in life as if he were so. Fortunately the expense will be nothing to us.\" \"But this woman has a right to one of them.\" \"She does not deserve to have one,\" Captain Clinton said angrily; \"but of course we must make some arrangement with her. She is bound to do her best to repair the terrible mischief her carelessness has caused. Well, doctor, we will think it over for an hour or two, but certainly your suggestion seems by far the best for us to adopt.\" \"The hussy!\" the doctor said as he walked away to his quarters. \"I am more than half inclined to believe that she has done it on purpose. I never liked the jade before she married, though I own that she has turned out better than I expected. But I always thought her a designing and artful young woman, and gave her credit for plenty of brains, and what could suit her purpose better than this change of children? She would see that in the first place she would get her own boy well brought up, and perhaps provided for, with all sorts of chances of making money out of the affair. It may have been an accident, of course, but if so, it was a wonderfully fortunate one for her.\" Such was the opinion among the women of the regiment[Pg 17] when the news became known, and Jane Humphreys was speedily made aware of the fact by the change in their manner towards her. They had, however, but small opportunity for demonstrating their opinion, for Mrs. Humphreys remained shut up as much as possible in her room, and the one or two women who were inclined to take a favourable view of the matter and so called upon her, reported that she was completely prostrated by the occurrence. Among the officers and their families the greatest commiseration was felt for Captain Clinton and his wife, and the matter was discussed at tiffin that day with great animation. \"Don\u0027t you think, doctor, that a woman must know her own child?\" a young ensign asked. \"Not at all, Arbuthnot; that is to say, not if you mean that she would know it by any sort of maternal instinct. There is no such thing. She has no more means of telling her own infant out of a dozen others of similar complexion, age, and appearance, than she would have of picking out her own pocket-handkerchief out of a dozen others of similar pattern if they were all unmarked.\" \"But a sheep can pick out his own lamb among a hundred, doctor, and I am sure they are alike as so many peas. Surely that must be maternal instinct?\" \"Not in the smallest degree, Arbuthnot. The sheep and other animals possess in a very high degree a sense which is comparatively rudimentary in human beings. I mean, of course, the sense of smell. A sheep knows her lamb, and a cow knows her calf, neither by the sense of hearing or by that of sight. She recognizes it solely and wholly by her sense of smell, just as a dog can track its master\u0027s footsteps out of a thousand by the same sense. The two babies are as alike as twins; and I am not surprised that, if they really got mixed, this woman should not be able to detect one from the other.\" \"It is an awful thing for Clinton,\" the major said. \"Here he has got a splendid estate, and he will never be certain[Pg 18] whether his own son or a stranger is going to inherit it after him. It is enough to make a man go out of his mind.\" \"I don\u0027t see that that would be likely to mend matters,\" the doctor said dryly; \"in fact it would lessen the one chance that exists of ever setting the matter straight. As I have told him, though these children are very much alike at present—and indeed most babies are—it is probable that as they grow up there will no longer be any resemblance whatever, and that his own child will develop a likeness either to him or Mrs. Clinton, while the other child will resemble the sergeant or his wife.\" \"We must hope it will be so,\" the major said, \"though there are lots of fellows who don\u0027t resemble in the least either of their parents. But what is Clinton going to do about it?\" \"He has not settled yet. His wife was in no condition to discuss the matter, poor lady! My suggestion was that he should bring up both the children as if they were his own, until one or other of them develops this likeness that I was speaking of.\" \"I suppose that is the best thing they can do, doctor; but it will be an awful business if, as they grow up, no likeness to anybody can be detected in either of them.\" \"Well, major, although at present it does seem an awful thing, it won\u0027t seem so bad at the end, say, of twenty years. They will naturally by that time be as fond of one as the other. The boys, in fact, will be like twins; and I suppose the property can be divided in some such way as it would be were they really in that relation to each other.\" \"But, you see, doctor,\" one of the captains said, \"Mrs. Humphreys has to be considered to a certain extent too. It is hard on Mrs. Clinton; but if she gets both boys she is certain at any rate that one of them is her son, and Mrs. Humphreys will, by that arrangement, have to lose her child altogether. That seems to me pretty rough on her.\"[Pg 19] \"Well, she brought it on herself,\" the doctor replied. \"The whole thing has arisen from her carelessness.\" \"Do you think it was carelessness, doctor?\" the major asked. \"That is a matter on which I will give no opinion, major. It is one upon which one man can form a judgment as well as another. The thing may very well have happened in the way she describes; and again it may be a very cunningly devised plot on her part. It is evident she had everything to gain by such an accident. She would get her child taken off her hands, educated, and provided for. She would calculate no doubt that she would be their nurse, and would expect, in return for giving up her claim to one or other of them, some very distinct monetary advantages. I do not at all say that the affair was not an accident. Upon the contrary, I admit that it was an accident which might very well happen under the circumstances. What I do say is, nothing could have turned out better for her.\" Just as tiffin was finished, Captain Clinton\u0027s soldier-servant came into the mess-room with the request that Dr. Parker should go across to his master\u0027s bungalow. \"Well, doctor,\" Captain Clinton said as he entered, \"in the first place I want you to go up and see my wife, and give her a sedative or something, for she is terribly upset over this affair; and in the next place I want to tell you that we have agreed to take your advice in the matter, and to bring up the two children as our own until we can make out which of the two is our child; then I want your advice as to whether they can be weaned without any damage to their health. My wife is determined upon that point. They shall not be brought up by Mrs. Humphreys. There is no other woman, is there, in the regiment with a young baby?\" The doctor shook his head. \"There are one or two with babies, but not with babies young enough for her to take to these. It would certainly be far better that they should have[Pg 20] the natural nourishment, but I do not say that they would necessarily suffer from being weaned. Still, you see, Clinton, there is a question whether this woman will consent to part with both the children.\" \"I quite see that, doctor, and of course I shall be ready to make any money arrangements that will content her.\" \"I would see the husband, if I were you,\" the doctor said. \"He is a steady, well-conducted young fellow, and however this matter has come about, I quite acquit him of having any share in it. I think you will find it more easy to deal with him than his wife. Unfortunately, you see, there is always a difficulty with adopted children. A father cannot sell away his rights; he may agree to do so, but if he changes his mind afterwards he can back out of his agreement. However he may bind himself never to interfere with it, the fact remains that he has a legal right to the custody of his child. And though Sergeant Humphreys might keep any agreement he might make, the mother might give you no end of trouble afterwards.\" \"I see all that, doctor, but of the two evils I think the one we propose is the least. My wife says she could not bear to see this woman about the children, and I have a good deal of the same feeling myself. At any rate in her present state of health I wish to spare her all trouble and anxiety as much as I can, and therefore it is better to buy this woman off for the present, even though we may have to run the risk of trouble with her afterwards. Anyhow, something must be done at once. The children have both been squalling for the last hour, though I believe that they have had some milk or something given to them. So I had better send across for Humphreys, the sooner the matter is got over the better.\" The young sergeant presently appeared. \"Sit down, sergeant. I want to have a talk with you over this terribly painful business. In one respect I quite understand that it is as painful for you and Mrs. Humphreys as it is for us, but in other respects you are much better off than I[Pg 21] am. Not only do I not know which is my child, but I do not know which is heir to my estate; which is, as you will understand, a most serious matter.\" \"I can quite understand that, sir,\" the sergeant said quietly. \"The only plan that I can see,\" Captain Clinton went on, \"is that for the present I shall adopt both children, and shall bring them up as my own. Probably in time one of them will grow up with some resemblance to myself or Mrs. Clinton, and the other will show a likeness to you or your wife. In that case I should propose to finish the education of your boy, and then to provide for him by putting him into the army, or such other profession as he may choose; for it would be very unfair after bringing him up and educating him as my own to turn him adrift. Thus, you see, in any case my adoption of him would be greatly to his benefit. I can, of course, thoroughly understand that it will be very hard for you and Mrs. Humphreys to give up your child. Very hard. And I am quite ready to make any pecuniary arrangement with you and her that you may think right. I may say that I do not think that it would be desirable that Mrs. Humphreys should continue as their nurse. I want to consider the boys as my own, and her presence would be constantly bringing up unpleasant remembrances. In the second place I think that it would be better for her that she should not act as their nurse. She would know that one of them is her own, and the separation when it came would be very much more painful than it would be at present. Of course I do not expect an answer from you just at this moment. You will naturally wish to talk it over with her, but I shall be glad if you will let us have an answer as soon as you can, as it is necessary that we should obtain another nurse without loss of time.\" \"What you say seems to me very fair, Captain Clinton,\" the sergeant said. \"I would give anything, sir, that this shouldn\u0027t have happened. I would rather have shot myself first. I can answer for myself, sir, that I accept your offer.[Pg 22] Of course, I am sorry to lose the child; but a baby is not much to a man till it gets to know him and begins to talk, and it will be a satisfaction to know that he is in good hands, with a far better look-out than I could have given him. I will see my wife, sir, and let you know in half an hour.\" \"Do you think that she will consent, Humphreys?\" \"I am sure she will,\" the sergeant said briefly, and then added, \"There is nothing else she could do,\" and saluting he went out of the room. \"He suspects his wife of having done it on purpose,\" Dr. Parker said, speaking for the first time since the sergeant had entered the room. \"I don\u0027t say he knows it, but he suspects it. Did you notice how decidedly he said that she would consent? And I fancy up to now she has had her own way in everything.\" \"Well, what do they say?\" Mrs. Humphreys asked as her husband entered the door. He told her shortly the offer that had been made. She laughed scornfully. \"A likely thing that! So they are to have both children, and I am not to be allowed even to see them; and they are to pick and choose as to which they like to say is theirs, and we are to be shouldered out of it altogether! It is just as bad for me not to know which is my boy as it is for that woman; but they are to take the whole settlement of things in their hands, my feelings to go for nothing. Of course you told them that you would not let them do such a thing?\" \"I did not tell them anything of the sort. I told them that I accepted their proposal, and that I could answer for your accepting it too.\" \"Then you were never more wrong in your life, John Humphreys!\" she said angrily; \"I won\u0027t consent to anything of the sort. Luck has thrown a good thing in our hands, and I mean to make the most of it. We ought to get enough out of this to make us comfortable for life if we work it well. I did not think that you were such a soft!\" \"Soft or not soft, it is going to be done as they propose,\"[Pg 23] her husband said doggedly. \"It is burden enough as it is—we have lost our child. Not that I care so very much about that; there will be time enough for more, and children do not add to the comfort of close little quarters like these. But whether we like it or not, we have lost the child. In the next place we shall never hear the end of it in the regiment, and I shall see if I cannot manage to get transferred to another. There will be no standing the talk there will be.\" \"Let them talk!\" his wife said scornfully. \"What do we care about their talk!\" \"I care a great deal,\" he said. \"And I tell you why, because I know what they will say is true.\" \"What do you mean?\" she asked quickly. \"I mean, Jane, that I know you mixed up those children on purpose.\" \"How dare you say so!\" she exclaimed making a step forward as if she would strike him. \"I will tell you why I say so. Because I went to the drawer this morning before going to parade, and I saw some of Mrs. Clinton\u0027s baby\u0027s night-gowns in it. Yes, I see they are all in the wash-tub now; but they were there this morning, and when I heard you say you had put the child into one of our baby\u0027s night-gowns because it had no clean ones of its own, I knew that you were lying, and that you had done this on purpose.\" The woman was silent a moment and then burst out, \"You are a greater fool than ever I thought you! I did tell a lie when I gave that reason for putting the child into our baby\u0027s gown. When I took the two clean ones out of the drawer I did not notice until I put them on that they were both ours, and then I thought it was not worth while changing again just as the child had got quiet and comfortable. Then when I found what had happened in the morning, I had to make some excuse or other, and that occurred to me as the best. When I came back I did put them all into the wash-tub, clean[Pg 24] and dirty, in case any one should come here to see about them. What harm was there in that, I should like to know?\" \"You have acknowledged you have told one lie over it; after that you may say what you like, but you need not expect me to believe you.\" \"Well, why don\u0027t you go at once and tell them that you believe that I changed the children on purpose?\" \"Because in the first place I cannot prove it, and because in the second case you are my wife, Jane. I took you for better or worse, and whatever you have done it is not for me to round on you. Anyhow, I will do all I can to set this matter straight, and the only way that I see it can be set straight is by doing as Captain Clinton says—by letting him have the two children until they grow up, and then see which of the two is like them and which is like us. What do you want done? I suppose you don\u0027t want to have the care of them both. I suppose you don\u0027t want to get paid for letting them keep them both, and to have every man and woman in the regiment asking the question, Who sold their child? What is it you do want?\" \"I want to go as their nurse.\" \"Well, then, you cannot do it. It is evident that Mrs. Clinton hates the sight of you, and no wonder; and she won\u0027t have you at any price. You had best be contented with what you have got.\" \"What have I got?\" she asked sullenly. \"Well, you have got the trouble of the child off your hands, you have got the knowledge that it will be well taken care of and provided for and made a gentleman of. That ought to be a satisfaction to you anyhow.\" \"What is that when we might make a nice little fortune out of it?\" \"I can see no way of making a fortune,\" he said, \"unless you do know which is which, and offer to tell them if they will pay you for it. In which case, instead of making a fortune[Pg 25] you would be likely to find yourself inside a prison for years—and serve you right.\" The woman was silent for some time, then she said, \"Very well, then, I will agree to their terms; but mind you, I will make money out of it yet.\" And so Sergeant Humphreys went across to Captain Clinton\u0027s bungalow and told him that his wife agreed to give up both children. \"It is by far the best thing for the little chap whichever he may be, and you will be able to do a deal more for him than I ever could. My wife did not quite see the matter at first, but she has come round to my way of thinking. No, sir, we do not want to be paid,\" as Captain Clinton was about to speak; \"as long as I am fit for service we want nothing. Some day, perhaps, when I get past service I may ask you to give me a job as a lodge-keeper or some such post, where I can earn my living.\" And so the matter was settled. One of the other officers\u0027 wives had already lent her ayah to take care of the children until one could be found for them. The ready manner in which Sergeant Humphreys had done the only thing in his power to obviate the effects of his wife\u0027s carelessness restored him at once to the good opinion of his fellow sergeants and the men, as it was generally allowed that he had done the right thing, and that no one could do more. Opinion, however, was less favourable as to his wife. It was soon evident to all who lived in the non-commissioned officers\u0027 quarters that things were not going on well between Sergeant Humphreys and his wife. There were frequent and violent quarrels. The sergeant was often down at the canteen drinking more than was good for him. One day Captain Clinton sent for him. \"Sergeant, I am sorry to say that I hear from the sergeant-major that you were drunk last night, and that you have several times been the worse for liquor. It is not a formal complaint, but I thought it better to talk to you. You have always been a[Pg 26] very steady man, and I should be sorry in the extreme if any thing should happen which would cause you to be brought before the colonel. I have no doubt this affair has troubled you greatly, and that it is entirely owing to that that you have become unsettled. Try to pull yourself round, man. You know that nobody attributes the slightest shadow of blame to you in the matter.\" \"Thank you, sir. I was coming to see you if you hadn\u0027t sent for me, to say that I wished to give up my stripes and return to the ranks. I know I shall be degraded if I don\u0027t do it of my own free-will, and I would rather go down than be sent down.\" \"But what will your wife do? It would be a great change to her, Humphreys.\" \"My wife has made up her mind to go home, sir, and I think it is the best thing she can do. She will never be comfortable in the regiment, and to say the truth we are not comfortable together. She says that she has friends in England she will go and stay with, and I think it is best to let her go. I would rather cut my hand off than ask for any thing for myself, but as I am sure that it is for the best that she should go, and as I don\u0027t hear of any invalids or women going home at present, I should be very much obliged if you would lend me twenty pounds. I have got thirty laid by, and fifty will be enough to send her across by rail to Bombay, pay her passage home, and leave her twenty pounds in hand when she gets there. I will pay it off so much a month.\" \"You are welcome to twenty pounds without any talk of repayment, Humphreys. But I wouldn\u0027t take any hasty step if I were you. If your wife and you have had a quarrel she may change her mind in a day or two, and think better of it.\" \"No, sir; I think we are pretty well agreed on the point that she had best go home. People make mistakes sometimes, and I think we both made a mistake when we got married.[Pg 27] Anyhow, we have both agreed that it is best to part for a time.\" Accordingly three or four days later Mrs. Humphreys left Agra for Bombay, and was seen no more in the regiment. Sergeant Humphreys gave up his stripes and returned to the ranks, and for two years remained there. After his wife had left him he gradually gave up the habit into which he had fallen, and at the end of the two years again became a non-commissioned officer. He was never heard to speak of his wife after she left him, nor so far as his comrades knew did he ever receive a letter from her. Soon after he had again got his stripes the regiment returned to England, and a month later Captain Clinton sent in his papers and retired from the service. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3124/85914.html","bookId":900,"book":{"id":900,"title":"The Dash for Khartoum","description":"简介： The story of the Nile Expedition is so recent that no word of introduction is necessary to the historical portion of the tale.
