{"id":13303,"no":4,"title":"CHAPTER III. GONE.","content":"\"Bravo, Clinton! Well done, indeed!\" so shouted one of the big boys, and a score of others joined in in chorus. \"Which is Clinton?\" a woman who was standing looking on at the game asked one of the younger boys. The boy looked up at the questioner. She was a woman of about forty years old, quietly dressed in black with a gloss of newness on it. \"I will point him out to you directly. They are all mixed up again now.\" \"There are two of them, are there not?\" the woman asked. \"Yes, that\u0027s the other; there—that one who has just picked up the ball and is running with it; there, that\u0027s the other, the one who is just charging the fellow who is trying to stop his brother.\" \"Well done!\" he shouted, as Edgar\u0027s opponent rolled over. The woman asked no more questions until the match was over, but stood looking on intently as the players came off the ground. Rupert and Edgar were together, laughing and talking in high spirits; for each had kicked a goal, and the town boys had been beaten by four goals to one. The boy to whom she had been speaking had long before strolled away to another part of the field, but she turned to another as the Clintons approached. \"Those are the Clintons, are they not?\" she asked.[Pg 48] \"Yes, and a good sort they are,\" the boy said heartily. She stood looking at them intently until they had passed her, then walked away with her eyes bent on the ground, and made her way to a small lodging she had taken in the town. For several days she placed herself so that she could see the boys on their way to and fro between River-Smith\u0027s and the college, and watched them at football. \"I wonder who that woman is,\" Rupert said one day to his brother. \"I constantly see her about, and she always seems to be staring at me.\" \"I thought she stared at me too,\" Edgar said. \"I am sure I do not know her. I don\u0027t think I have ever seen her face before.\" \"She asked me whether you were Clinton the other day when you were playing football. It was just after you had made a run with the ball, and some one shouted, \u0027Well done, Clinton!\u0027 And she asked me which was Clinton, and whether there were not two of them. And of course I pointed you both out,\" a youngster said who was walking with them. \"That is rum, too,\" Rupert said. \"I wonder who the woman is, Edgar, and what interest she can have in us.\" \"If she has any interest, Rupert, I suppose she will stop staring some day and speak. Perhaps it is some old servant, though I don\u0027t remember her. Well, it is no odds any way.\" Jane Humphreys was much puzzled as to what step she should take first. During all these years she had waited she had always expected that she should have known which was her own child as soon as she set eyes on the boys, and was surprised and disappointed to find that even after a week\u0027s stay at Cheltenham, and examining their faces as closely as she could, she had not the slightest idea which was which. She had imagined that she should not only know, but feel an affection for the boy who was her own, and she had fully intended to place him in the position of Captain Clinton\u0027s heir, trusting[Pg 49] to receive the promise of a large sum from him when he should come into possession. Now it seemed to her that she cared no more for one than for the other, and that her best plan therefore was to place in the position of heir whichever of them was most likely to suit her purpose. But here, again, she was in a difficulty. If they resembled each other in no other point, they both looked thoroughly manly, straightforward, and honest lads, neither of whom would be likely to entertain any dishonourable proposition. Her intention had been to say to her son, \"You are not really the twin brother, as you suppose, of the other. Captain and Mrs. Clinton do not know which of you two is their child.\" She wondered whether they already knew as much as that. Probably they did. So many people had known of that affair at Agra, that Captain Clinton had probably told them himself. She would tell the boy, \"I am the only person in the world who can clear up the mystery. I have the key to it in my hand, and can place either you or the other in the position of sole heir to the estate. I shall expect to be paid a handsome sum from the one I put into possession. Remember, on one hand I can give you a splendid property, on the other I can show you to have been from the first a usurper of things you had no right to—an interloper and a fraud.\" It had seemed to her a simple matter before she came down to Cheltenham. Surely no boy in his senses would hesitate a moment in accepting her offer. It had always been a fixed thing in her mind that this would be so, but now she felt that it was not so certain as she before imagined. She hesitated whether she should not defer it until the boys came of age, and the one she chose could sign a legal document; but she was anxious to leave England, and go right away to America or Australia. Besides, if she had the promise she could enforce its fulfilment. Which boy should she select? She changed her mind several times, and at last determined that she would leave it to chance, and would choose the one whom she next met.[Pg 50] It chanced that Edgar was the first she encountered after having taken this resolution, and it happened that he was walking by himself, having remained in the class-room a few minutes after the rest of the boys had left, to speak to the master respecting a difficult passage in a lesson. The woman placed herself in his way. \"Well, what is it?\" he said. \"You have been hanging about for the last week. What is it you want?\" \"I want to speak to you about something very important.\" \"Oh, nonsense!\" he said. \"There is nothing important you can have to tell me.\" \"Yes, there is; something of the greatest importance. You do not suppose that I should have been here for a week waiting to tell it to you, if it was not.\" \"Well, I suppose you think it important,\" he said; \"so fire away.\" \"I cannot tell you now,\" she said; \"it is too long a story. Could you spare me half an hour, young sir? You will not be sorry for it afterwards, I promise you.\" Edgar looked impatiently at his watch. He had nothing particular to do at the moment, and his curiosity was excited. \"I can spare it you now,\" he said. \"I am staying at this address,\" she said, handing him a piece of paper. \"It is not five minutes\u0027 walk from here. I will go on, if you will follow me.\" \"All right,\" Edgar said, looking at the paper; \"though I expect it is some fooling or other.\" She walked away rapidly, and he sauntered after her. She was standing with the door open when he arrived, and he followed her into a small parlour. He threw himself down into a chair. \"Now, fire away,\" he said; \"and be as quick as you can.\" \"Before I begin,\" she said quietly, \"will you tell me if you know anything relating to the circumstances of your birth?\" THE WOMAN PLACED HERSELF IN HIS WAY. \"THE WOMAN PLACED HERSELF IN HIS WAY.\" He looked at her in astonishment. \"No,\" he said. \"What[Pg 51] in the world should I know about the circumstances of my birth?\" \"You know that you were born at Agra in India?\" \"Of course I know that.\" \"And your father, Captain Clinton, has never spoken to you about the circumstances?\" Edgar shook his head. \"No; I only know that I was born there.\" \"I should have thought that he would have told you the story,\" she said; \"for there were many knew of it, and you would be sure to hear it sooner or later.\" \"I do not want to hear of it,\" he said, leaping to his feet. \"If there was anything my father wanted me to know he would tell it to me at once. You do not suppose I want to hear it from anyone else?\" He was making for the door, when she said, \"Then you do not know that you are not his son?\" He stopped abruptly. \"Don\u0027t know I am not his son!\" he repeated. \"You must be mad.\" \"I am not mad at all,\" she said. \"You are not his son. Not any relation in the world to him. Sit down again and I will tell you the story.\" He mechanically obeyed, feeling overwhelmed with the news he had heard. Then as she told him how the children had become mixed, and how Captain Clinton had decided to bring them up together until he should be able to discover by some likeness to himself or wife which was his son, Edgar listened to the story with a terrible feeling of oppression stealing over him. He could not doubt that she was speaking the truth, for if it were false it could be contradicted at once. There were circumstances too which seemed to confirm it. He recalled now, that often in their younger days his father and mother had asked casual visitors if they saw any likeness between either of the children to them; and he specially remembered how closely Colonel Winterbottom,[Pg 52] who had been major in his father\u0027s regiment, had scrutinized them both, and how he had said, \"No, Clinton, for the life of me I cannot see that one is more like you and your wife than the other.\" And now this woman had told him that he was not their son; and he understood that she must be this sergeant\u0027s wife, and that if he was not Captain Clinton\u0027s son she must be his mother. \"You are Mrs. Humphreys, I suppose?\" he said in a hard, dry voice when she had ceased speaking. \"I am your mother,\" she said. He moved as if struck with sudden pain as she spoke, but said nothing. \"I sacrificed myself for your sake,\" she went on after a pause. \"I had them both, and it seemed to me hard that my boy should grow up to be a boy of the regiment, with nothing better to look forward to than to enlist in it some day, while the other, no better in any respect than him, should grow up to be a rich man, with everything the heart could desire, and I determined that he should have an equal chance with the other. I knew that perhaps some day they might find out which was which by a likeness, but that was not certain, and at any rate you would get a good education and be well brought up, and you were sure to be provided for, and when the time should come, if there was still doubt, I could give you the chance of either having the half or all just as you chose. It was terrible for me to give you up altogether, but I did it for your good. I suffered horribly, and the women of the regiment turned against me. Your father treated me badly, and I had to leave him and come home to England. But my comfort has all along been that I had succeeded; that you were being brought up as a gentleman, and were happy and well cared for.\" Edgar sat silent for some time. \"How do you know,\" he asked suddenly, \"that it is Rupert and not I who is the real son?\" \"One of the infants,\" she said, \"had a tiny mole no bigger[Pg 53] than a pin\u0027s head on his shoulder, and I was sure that I would always know them apart from that.\" \"Yes, Rupert has a mark like that,\" Edgar admitted, for he had noticed it only a short time before. \"Yes,\" the woman said quietly. \"Mrs. Clinton\u0027s child had that mark. It was very, very small and scarcely noticeable, but as I washed and dressed them when babies, I noticed it.\" \"Well, what next?\" Edgar asked roughly. \"As I said, my boy,\"—Edgar winced as she spoke—\"it is for you to choose whether you will have half or all the property. If I hold my tongue you will go on as you are now, and they will never know which is their son. If you like to have it all, to be the heir of that grand place and everything else, I have only to go and say that my boy had a mole on his shoulder. There is nothing I would not do to make you happy.\" \"And I suppose,\" Edgar said quietly, \"you will want some money for yourself?\" \"I do not wish to make any bargain, if that is what you mean,\" she said in an indignant tone. \"I know, of course, that you can give me no money now. I suppose that in either case you would wish to help a mother who has done so much for you. I don\u0027t expect gratitude at present. Naturally you are upset about what I have told you. Some day when you grow to be a man you will appreciate better than you can now what I have done for you, and what you have gained by it.\" Edgar sat silent for a minute or two, and then he rose quietly and said, \"I will think it all over. You shall have my answer in a day or two,\" and without another word left the room and sauntered off. \"What is the matter, Edgar?\" Rupert asked two hours later. \"I have been looking for you everywhere, and young Johnson has only just said that you told him to tell me you were feeling very seedy, and were going to lie down for a bit.\" \"I have got a frightful headache, Rupert,\" Edgar, who was[Pg 54] lying with his face to the wall, said. \"I am too bad to talk, old fellow; let me alone. I daresay I shall be all right when I have had a night\u0027s sleep. Tell River-Smith, will you, that I am seedy, and cannot come down to tea. I do not want the doctor or anything of that sort, but if I am not all right in the morning, I will see him.\" Rupert went out quietly. It was something new Edgar\u0027s being like this, he never remembered him having a bad headache before. \"I expect,\" he said to himself, \"he got hurt in one of those scrimmages yesterday, although he did not say anything about it. I do hope that he is not going to be ill. The examinations are on next week, it will be a frightful nuisance for him to miss them.\" He went into Edgar\u0027s dormitory again the last thing. He opened the door very quietly in case he should be asleep. \"I am not asleep,\" Edgar said; \"I am rather better now. Good-night, Rupert,\" and he held out his hand. Rupert was surprised at the action, but took his hand and pressed it. \"Good-night, Edgar. I do hope that you will be all right in the morning.\" \"Good-night, old fellow. God bless you!\" and there was almost a sob in the lad\u0027s voice. Rupert went out surprised and uneasy. \"Edgar must be worse than he says,\" he thought to himself. \"It is rum of him saying good-night in that way. I have never known him do such a thing before. I wish now that I had asked River-Smith to send round for the doctor. I daresay Edgar would not have liked it, but it would have been best; but he seemed so anxious to be quiet and get off to sleep, that I did not think of it.\" The first thing in the morning Rupert went to his brother\u0027s dormitory to see how he was. He tapped at the door, but there was no answer. Thinking that his brother was asleep, he turned the handle and went in. An exclamation of surprise broke from him. Edgar was not there and the bed had[Pg 55] not been slept in, but was just as he had seen it when Edgar was lying on the outside. On the table was a letter directed to himself. He tore it open. \"My dear Rupert,\" it began, \"a horrible thing has happened, and I shall be off to-night. I have learned that I am not your brother at all, but that I was fraudulently put in that position. I have been writing this afternoon to father and mother. Oh! Rupert, to think that it is the last time I can call them so. They will tell you the whole business. I am writing this by the light of the lamp in the passage, and you will all be up in a few minutes, so I have no time to say more. I shall post the other letter to-night. Good-bye, Rupert! Good-bye, dear old fellow! We have been happy together, haven\u0027t we? and I hope you will always be so. Perhaps some day when I have made myself a name—for I have no right to call myself Clinton, and I won\u0027t call myself by my real name—I may see you again. I have taken the note, but I know that you won\u0027t grudge it me.\" Rupert read the letter through two or three times, then ran down as he was, in his night-shirt and trousers, and passed in to the master\u0027s part of the private house. \"Robert,\" he said to the man-servant whom he met in the passage, \"is Mr. River-Smith dressed yet?\" \"He is not finished dressing yet, Master Clinton; at least he has not come out of his room. But I expect he is pretty near dressed.\" \"Will you ask him to come out to me at once, please?\" Rupert said. \"It is a most serious business, or you may be sure I should not ask.\" The man asked no questions, for he saw by Rupert\u0027s face that this must be something quite out of the ordinary way. \"Just step into this room and I will fetch him,\" he said. In a minute the master came in. \"What is it, Clinton,—nothing serious the matter, I hope?\" \"Yes, sir, I am afraid it is something very serious. My[Pg 56] brother was not well yesterday evening. He said that he had a frightful headache, but he thought it would be all right in the morning, and he went and lay down on his bed. I thought that he was strange in his manner when I went in to say good-night to him; and when I went in this morning, sir, the bed hadn\u0027t been slept in and he was gone, and he has left me this note, and it is evident, as you will see, that he is altogether off his head. You see, he fancies that he is not my brother.\" The master had listened with the gravest concern, and now glanced hastily through the letter. \"\u0027Tis strange indeed,\" he said. \"There is no possibility, of course, that there is anything in this idea of his?\" \"No, sir, of course not. How could there be?\" \"That I cannot say, Clinton. Anyhow the matter is most serious. Of course he could not have taken any clothes with him?\" \"No, sir; at least he cannot have got any beyond what he stands in. I should think the matron would not have given him any out, especially as he must have told her that he was ill, or he could not have got into the dormitory.\" \"I had better see her first, Clinton; it is always well to be quite sure of one\u0027s ground. You go up and dress while I make the inquiries.\" Rupert returned to the dormitory, finished dressing, and then ran down again. \"He has taken no clothes with him, Clinton. The matron says that he went to her in the afternoon and said that he had a splitting headache, and wanted to be quite quiet and undisturbed. She offered to send for the doctor, but he said that he expected that he should be all right in the morning, but that if he wasn\u0027t of course the doctor could see him then. So she unlocked the door of the dormitory and let him in. I asked her if he had his boots on. She said no; he was going up in them, contrary to rule, when she reminded him of it, and he took them off and put them in[Pg 57] the rack in the wood-closet. I have seen the boot-boy, and he says he noticed when he went there this morning early to clean them, No. 6 rack was empty. So your brother must have come down, after he had gone up to the dormitory, and got his boots. \"Now let us ask a few questions of the servants.\" He rang the bell, and sent for some of the servants. \"Which of you were down first this morning?\" he asked. \"I was down first, sir,\" one of the girls said. \"Did you find anything unusual?\" \"Yes, sir. One of the windows downstairs, looking into the yard, was open, though I know I closed it and put up the shutters last night; and John says the door of the yard has been unbolted too, and that the lock had been forced.\" The master went out, walked across the yard, and examined the lock. \"There would be no difficulty in opening that on this side,\" he said to Rupert; \"it could be done with a strong pocket-knife easily enough.\" \"What is to be done, sir?\" Rupert asked anxiously. \"Shall I telegraph to my father?\" \"I think you had better go and see him, Clinton. Your brother probably did not leave the house until twelve o\u0027clock, though he may have gone at eleven. But whether eleven or twelve it makes no difference. No doubt he posted the letter he speaks of the first thing on leaving; but, you see, it is a cross post to your place, and the letter could not anyhow have got there for delivery this morning. You can hardly explain it all by telegram; and I think, as I said, it is better that you should go yourself. I will have breakfast put for you in my study, and I will have a fly at the door. You will be able to catch the eight-o\u0027clock train into Gloucester, and you should be home by eleven.\" \"You do not think anything could have happened to him?\" Rupert asked anxiously.[Pg 58] \"No, I do not think that there is any fear of that, Clinton. You see, he has got a fixed idea in his head; he has evidently acted with deliberation. Besides, you see in his letter to you he says he shall not see you until he has made a name for himself. I tell you frankly, Clinton, that my own impression is that your brother is not mad, but that he has—of course I do not know how, or attempt to explain it—but that he has in some way got the idea that he is not your brother. Has he been quite himself lately?\" \"Quite, sir; I have seen nothing unusual about him at all.\" \"Did he seem bright and well yesterday morning?\" \"Just the same as usual, sir. I was quite surprised when, just at tea-time, I found that he had gone to lie down with the headache.\" \"Did he get any letter yesterday?\" \"No, sir; we neither of us had any letter, in the morning anyhow. He may have received one in the afternoon, for anything I know.\" \"I will go and ask Robert,\" the master said; \"he always takes the letters from the letter-bag.\" \"No, Clinton,\" he went on when he returned; \"there were only three letters for the boys in the afternoon mail, and neither of them was for him. He cannot have seen anyone, can he, who could have told him any story that would serve as a foundation for this idea?\" Then an idea flashed across Rupert. \"Well, sir, a rather curious thing has happened in the last few days. There has been a woman about here, and it appears she asked one of the boys which were the Clintons; and we have seen her every time we have been out, and we both noticed that she has stared at us in a very strange way. I don\u0027t know that that can possibly have anything to do with it. She may have spoken to Edgar yesterday. Of course I cannot say.\" \"Well, I must be going now. I have told Robert to put your breakfast in my study, and to send the boy for a fly.\"[Pg 59] \"What will you say to the boys, sir?\" Rupert asked anxiously. \"There will be no occasion to say anything for a day or two beyond the fact that you are obliged to go home suddenly. I shall only say Clinton, but it will naturally be supposed that I mean both of you. If it gets out that you have gone alone, which it may do, although I shall give strict orders to the contrary, I shall of course mention that we fear that your brother got his head hurt in that football match, and that he has taken up some strange ideas and has gone off. But it is hardly likely that the matter will leak out in any way until you return, or I hear from you. I think you can make yourself quite easy on that score.\" It was half-past eleven when Rupert Clinton reached home. On the way he had thought over how he had best break the news quietly to his father, and he got out of the trap that had driven him from the station at the lodge, and made a long circuit so as to reach the stable without being seen from the front windows of the house. He went at once to the old coachman, who was a great ally of the boys. The man uttered an exclamation of astonishment at seeing him. \"Why, Master Rupert, I thought that you were not coming home for another fortnight. Well, you have given me a start!\" \"Look here, Fellows, I have come to see my father about a serious matter, and I want to see him before I see my mother.\" \"Nothing the matter with Master Edgar, I hope, sir?\" \"Yes, it is about him; but I will tell you presently, Fellows, I don\u0027t want to lose a minute now. Please go into the house and get my father to come out at once to the stables. Make any excuse you like to bring him out, and as you come along you can tell him I am here.\" In five minutes Captain Clinton hurried into the saddle-room, where Rupert was standing. He was pale and agitated. \"What is the matter, Rupert,—has anything happened to Edgar? I know that it must be something very serious or you would never come like this.\"[Pg 60] \"It is serious, father, very serious;\" and he told him what had happened, and handed him the letter that Edgar had left. \"You see he has evidently gone out of his mind, father.\" Captain Clinton ran his eye over the letter and gave an exclamation of surprise and grief, then he stood for a minute covering his face with his hand. When he removed it Rupert saw that his eyes were filled with tears. \"Poor boy!\" he murmured, \"I see that we have made a terrible mistake, although we did it for the best.\" \"A mistake, father! Why, is it possible, can it be true that—\" \"That Edgar is not your brother, my boy? Yes, it is certain that he is not your brother, though whether he or you is our son we know not.\" Rupert stood speechless with astonishment. \"One of us not your son!\" he said at last in a broken voice. \"Oh, father, how can that be?\" \"It happened thus, Rupert,\" Captain Clinton said, and then told him the story of the confusion that had arisen between the children. He then went on: \"You see, Rupert, we hoped, your mother and I, at first that we should find out as you grew up, by the likeness one of you might develop to your mother or myself, which was our child; but for some years now, my boy, I have feared rather than hoped to discover a likeness, and have been glad that neither of you took after either of us, as far as we could see. We loved you equally, and could not bear the thought of losing either of you. We had two sons instead of one, that was all; and had one been proved to be ours, we should have lost the other. We intended to tell you in a short time how the matter stood, and that while one was our adopted son and the other our own, we neither knew nor cared which was which, loving you both equally and regarding you both as our own. Indeed we should never have told you about it, had it not been that as the story of the confusion at your birth was known to a great many men who were at that time in India, it was almost sure to come to your ears sooner or later. Had we[Pg 61] ever dreamt that it would come like this, of course we should have told you long ago. But how can Edgar have learnt it? Still more, how can anyone have been able to tell him—what even we do not know—that he is not our son?\" \"You will know when the letter arrives by the next post, father. But now I have heard the story, I think it must have been told him by a woman;\" and he related how they had been watched by a woman who was a stranger to them. \"What was she like, Rupert?\" Rupert described her as well as he was able. \"I have no doubt that it was Mrs. Humphreys, Rupert; she would be about the age you describe, and, allowing for the seventeen years that have passed since I have seen her, like her in appearance. But we had better go in to your mother now, she must be told. I will go in first and break it to her. Of course there is nothing else that can be done until we get Edgar\u0027s letter. I will send a man off on horseback to the post-office, we shall get it an hour earlier than if we wait for the postman to bring it.\" It was half an hour before Captain Clinton came out from the drawing-room and called Rupert in. The boy had been telling the news to Madge, having asked his father if he should do so. She had been terribly distressed, and Rupert himself had completely broken down. \"You can come in now, both of you,\" Captain Clinton said. \"Of course, your mother is dreadfully upset, so try and keep up for her sake.\" Mrs. Clinton embraced Rupert in silence, she was too affected for speech. \"Do you think,\" she said after a time in broken tones, \"Edgar can have gone with this woman?\" \"I don\u0027t know, mother; I have not been able to think about it. I should not think he could. I know if it had been me I should have hated her even if she was my mother, for coming after all this time to rob me of your love and father\u0027s. I[Pg 62] should run away as he has done, I daresay, though I don\u0027t know about that; but I would not have gone with her.\" \"I cannot make out how she could have known which was which,\" Captain Clinton said, walking up and down the room; \"we have never seen any likeness in either of you to ourselves, but it is possible she may have seen a likeness in Edgar to her husband. By the way,\" he said suddenly, \"I must send off a telegram to River-Smith; he, of course, will be most anxious.\" He took a telegram form from his desk, and after a minute\u0027s hesitation wrote: \"No anxiety as to Edgar\u0027s mind can account for his conduct—will write fully to-morrow after I have received his letter—shall keep Rupert here some days.\" Then putting it in an envelope, he rang the bell and directed the servant to give it to one of the grooms with orders to ride with it at once to the nearest telegraph station. \"Now, Rupert, the best thing you and Madge can do is to go out for a walk. You can know nothing more until the letter arrives, and it will be better for you to be moving about than to be sitting here quietly. Your mother had best lie down until the letter comes; it cannot be here until five o\u0027clock.\" Madge and Rupert as they walked talked the matter over in every possible light, the only conclusion at which they arrived being that whoever might be Edgar\u0027s father and mother they would always regard him as their brother, and should love him just the same as before. \"I cannot think why he ran away!\" Madge exclaimed over and over again. \"I am sure I should not run away if I found that I wasn\u0027t father and mother\u0027s real daughter. They have been everything to me, and I could not love them a bit less if I did know that I was their adopted child instead of being their real one.\" \"No, certainly not,\" Rupert agreed; \"but then, you see, Madge, Edgar may have thought that he had been adopted, not as childless people sometimes adopt children, but because they could not help adopting him.\"[Pg 63] \"But that wasn\u0027t his fault, Rupert.\" \"No, that wasn\u0027t his fault; but I can understand him feeling that it made a great difference. Oh, I wonder what he is doing! I expect he went up to London by the night mail; he would have caught that at Glo\u0027ster. But what could he do when he got there?\" \"Oh, I am not thinking about that!\" the girl said. \"I am thinking what he must feel when he knows father and mother are not his father and mother, and that you and I are not his brother and sister. It must be awful, Rupert.\" \"It must be awful,\" Rupert agreed. \"I do not know what I should have done had it been me, and you know it might just as well have been me as Edgar. I wish it were five o\u0027clock!\" The afternoon seemed indeed endless to them all. For the last half-hour Rupert and Madge sat at the window gazing across the park for the first sight of the horseman, and at last they exclaimed simultaneously, \"There he comes!\" Captain Clinton, who had been sitting by the sofa holding his wife\u0027s hand in his, rose. \"I will go and meet him,\" he said. \"Rupert and Madge, you had better go into the library until I call you. I must read it over first to your mother.\" Without a word they went into the other room, and from the window watched Captain Clinton as he walked quickly down the drive to meet the groom. They saw him take the letter, and, as the man rode on towards the stables, open it and stand reading it. \"It is very bad,\" Madge said almost in a whisper, as she saw her father drop his hand despondently to his side, and then with bent head walk towards the house. Not another word was spoken until Captain Clinton opened the door and called them. Madge had been crying silently, and the tears were running fast down Rupert\u0027s cheeks as he sat looking out on to the park. \"You had better read the letter here,\" Captain Clinton said. \"I may tell you what I did not mention before, that there was[Pg 64] a strong opinion among many at the time, that the confusion between the children arose, not from accident, as was said, but was deliberate, and this letter confirms that view. This is what has hit Edgar so hard.\" The letter was as follows:— \"My dearest father, for I cannot call you anything else, I have just heard about my birth from a woman who calls herself my mother, and who, I suppose, has a right to do so, though certainly I shall never call her or think of her so. She has told me about her child and yours getting mixed, and how you brought both up in hopes of finding out some day which was which. \"Rupert and I had noticed for some days a woman looking at us, and she met me this afternoon and said she had some thing of extreme importance to tell me. I went with her and she told me the story, and said that I was her son and not yours. I asked her how she knew me from Rupert, and she said that one of us had a small mole on the shoulder. I knew that Rupert had a tiny mole there, and she said that that was the mark by which she knew your son from hers. \"Then, father, she told me that she had done it all on purpose, and had sacrificed herself in order that I might benefit from it. This was all horrible! And then she actually proposed that I should not only keep silent about this, but offered to come forward and declare that it was her son who had the mole on his shoulder, so that I might get the whole and Rupert none. I don\u0027t want to say what I felt. I only told her I would think it over. I have been thinking it over, and I am going away. My dear father and mother, for I shall always think of you so, I thank you for all your love and kindness, which I have received through a horrible fraud. If it had all been an accident, and you had found out for yourselves by the likeness that Rupert was your son, I do not think that I should have minded, at least nothing like so much. I should, of course, have been very grieved that you were not my father and mother,[Pg 65] and that Rupert and Madge were not my brother and sister; but it would have been nobody\u0027s fault, and I am sure that you would all still have loved me. But to know that it has been a wicked fraud, that I have been an impostor palmed upon you, that there has been a plot and conspiracy to rob you, and that I have a mother who not only did this, but who could propose to me to go on deceiving you, and even to join in a fresh fraud and to swindle Rupert, is so awful that there is nothing for me to do but to go away. \"I feel sure you will all be sorry, and that though I am not your son you would go on treating me as if I were a younger brother of Rupert\u0027s. But I could not bear it, father. I could not accept anything from you, for I should feel that it was the result of this wicked fraud, that it was what this woman, I cannot call her mother, had schemed for me to get. Some day when I have made my way, and when all this may not hurt me so horribly as it seems to do now, I will come and see you all if you will let me, to thank you all for the love and kindness that should never have been mine. But that will not be till I am in a position when I can want nothing, for I feel now that were I dying of hunger I could not accept a crust from your hands, for if I did so I should feel I was a party to this abominable fraud. God bless you, dearest father and mother and Rupert and Madge!—Your unhappy Edgar.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3124/85916.html","bookId":900,"book":{"id":900,"title":"The Dash for Khartoum","description":"简介： The story of the Nile Expedition is so recent that no word of introduction is necessary to the historical portion of the tale.
