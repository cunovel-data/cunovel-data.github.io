{"id":13316,"no":17,"title":"CHAPTER XVI. IN DISGUISE.","content":"As long as there was a chance that the expedition might again advance Rupert did nothing farther, and indeed was unable to come to any decision as to his course. He had long since received an answer from Captain Clinton to his letter written as soon as he was well enough to sit up after arriving at Korti, with the news that Edgar had been present with the expedition, and was now a prisoner in the hands of the Arabs. Captain Clinton wrote in great distress himself, and said that his wife was completely prostrated with the news. He said: \"I[Pg 271] know I need not urge you, Rupert, to use every means to obtain some news of Edgar. Draw upon me for any amount, however large, that may be necessary for bribing natives to find, and if possible rescue, him. I fear that the latter is hopeless. Still, if you see even the most remote chance of it, let no question of expense stand in the way.\" But even the promises of rewards that seemed to them to be fabulous failed in eliciting from the spies any information as to Edgar\u0027s whereabouts. He certainly was neither at Berber nor at Khartoum, nor had the people he was with returned to Metemmeh; but beyond this negative information Rupert could learn nothing. He continued to work assiduously with his interpreter, and by the middle of May he had, after three months\u0027 work, made such progress that he was able to converse in simple phrases and to understand what was being said by the natives around him. In the third week in May, on his arrival at Korti, he learned that orders had that day been received that the whole force was to at once retire, that even Dongola was to be abandoned, and that Wady Halfa was to be the highest point on the river occupied. That evening he went up to General Buller\u0027s tent. The general was still at mess, and Rupert waited outside his tent until he returned. He had several times spoken to the general on matters of duty. \"Who is that?\" General Buller asked as he saw a figure standing in front of his tent. \"Clinton, sir. I am particularly anxious to speak to you if you can spare me a short time.\" \"Come in,\" the general said. \"What can I do for you? Take a seat there.\" \"You have perhaps heard, sir, that I made the discovery at Metemmeh that a brother of mine who had two years and a half ago run away from school and enlisted, was the trumpeter of the Heavies who was carried off by the Arabs close to Metemmeh.\"[Pg 272] \"Yes, I heard that, Clinton, and was very sorry for you. I cannot imagine a more distressing affair.\" \"It was really no fault of his that he ran away, general; he was under a misconception altogether, and neither my father nor mother blamed him in the slightest. I only say this to show that he did not run away from wildness. No one could have been steadier than he was. It was a frightful mistake connected with his birth which I need not trouble you about. We were greatly attached to each other, and my father and mother are completely broken down at the thought of his being a slave for life in the hands of the Arabs. Now, sir, for the last three months I have been working almost day and night at the language, and can get on fairly in it.\" \"Yes?\" General Buller put in, wondering what was coming next. \"I have come to ask you if you would be good enough to ask Lord Wolseley to let me have six months\u0027 leave. My intention is to disguise myself, and to go up the country with one or two friendly natives. I should pass as being dumb; as although I can make myself understood in simple matters I should, of course, be detected were any native to enter into a long conversation with me. I have seen Major Kitchener to-day, and he says that he has no doubt he could arrange with one of the sheiks for me to go with him, and to travel about the country with him until we found my brother. My father has authorized me to spend any money that may be required, and I could pay high enough to make it well worth the while of any of these natives to be faithful. I do not see any reasons why I should not succeed. I have been speaking to one of the surgeons, and he says that if at any time it is suspected that I am not really dumb, I can in half a minute burn my tongue so with caustic that if I open my mouth anyone would think I have got some disease of the tongue which prevents my speaking. As to the disguise, I got Captain Hunter, who sketches capitally, to make sketches of the heads of some of these Arabs. I sent these[Pg 273] down to a man at Cairo, and I have got up from him a wig that will, I think, deceive anyone.\" \"It is a tremendous risk, Clinton,\" General Buller said when he concluded; \"a tremendous risk, and I don\u0027t know that Lord Wolseley would consider himself justified in allowing you to attempt it. The idea does you honour, but upon my word I do not know what to say to it. It seems a mad scheme, and yet I cannot say that it might not succeed. You seem to have worked it all out in your own mind. To carry it through will require not only pluck but unfailing watchfulness and presence of mind. A simple word or a gesture might betray you.\" \"I have thought of all that, sir; but I don\u0027t see any reason why it shouldn\u0027t be done. I am quite sure, general, that if you had a brother a slave among the Arabs you would not hesitate a moment about attempting it.\" General Buller did not reply, but rising put on his helmet. \"I will go to the chief and ask him,\" he said; \"but I don\u0027t think he will feel authorized in letting you go.\" \"I don\u0027t ask him to authorize it officially, sir. I only ask for six months\u0027 leave of absence, or even for a month\u0027s leave of absence. At the end of that time of course my name would be removed from the Army List, but I think, if I ever return, I should be reinstated, or if not, I might get a fresh commission granted me.\" \"Oh, that would be all right! the general would see to that. Wait here until I come back.\" In a quarter of a hour General Buller returned. \"Come with me to the chief\u0027s tent,\" he said. \"I think that if you can convince him that you have thought the matter out thoroughly, and are prepared at all points, he will give you three months\u0027 leave, and will get it renewed as long as there is a chance of your turning up alive.\" Rupert was most kindly received by Lord Wolseley, who asked him many questions as to his plans. After he had again[Pg 274] explained them Rupert said: \"Major Kitchener has kindly promised that if you give me leave he will buy for me two of the fast camels. He said there was a party came in yesterday with two exceptionally good ones, and that no doubt they would sell if a sufficient price were offered. Of course I should not think of riding on either of these unless I had to run for my life, or until I found my brother, for they would at once attract attention. The natives could ride on them, and I should have an ordinary camel until the time came to use the fleet ones. I have a letter from my father authorizing me to draw to any extent; therefore no question of money would interfere with my carrying out the plan thoroughly.\" \"I do not know what your father would say to me on my return to England should you never get back, Clinton.\" \"I am sure that if my father were here he would approve, sir. Of course I shall write him a long letter explaining the whole circumstances, and I am as sure as if he stood here that he would say that I was perfectly right in making an effort to rescue Edgar. I should never be happy again were I to turn my face down the river now and leave him to slavery for life among the Arabs.\" \"Well, I will strain a point and let you go,\" Lord Wolseley said. \"I don\u0027t know whether I am right in doing so, but I cannot resist your desire to carry out your scheme for your brother\u0027s rescue. It is a noble attempt, Clinton, and I honour you for undertaking it. When your preparations are complete let me see you again. Consider yourself relieved of all duty at once.\" Thanking Lord Wolseley and General Buller for their kindness Rupert left the tent and returned to his quarters. The next morning he went the first thing to Major Kitchener\u0027s camp and told him that the question of his leave was settled, and that he should start as soon as the camels were procured and an arrangement could be made with one of the sheiks. \"Very well, Clinton, I will manage that for you. I expect[Pg 275] a sheik down in three days who has worked faithfully with us since the beginning of the campaign. He is the man I had in my eye; he has made journeys to Wady Halfa and to points on the Red Sea, and will know that our promises as to payments will be kept, and that whatever sum is agreed upon would be handed him over at any place to which he may take you. In order to prevent any difficulty on that score, I will, before you start, give you letters to merchants at Wady Halfa and all the ports requesting them to pay the sum we may agree upon, upon the presentation of my letter with your signature attached. I put it in that way because it is possible that you may have to make your way alone into Abyssinia, and in that case if you are satisfied with your guide you will put your name to the letter and he may then obtain the money at whichever port he may go to. All this of course I will explain to him. I will get the two camels this morning. They are exceptionally good beasts, and the owner will want a very long price for them. Camels like these are very rare, but they may be the means of saving your life.\" \"I will pay whatever he wants me to, sir; I quite see the importance of getting them. I am off duty now, and as the sheik is not to arrive for three days I will go down to Dongola. There is one of the transport boats starting in half an hour. I shall want to lay in a stock of dye. Fortunately, the exact colour is not material, for the natives are any shade between yellow and black.\" When Skinner and Easton came in from an evening ride they got off their ponies, and Skinner entered his hut. He was astonished at seeing a native calmly sitting there with the usual wild tangled hair and a dirty cotton cloth wrapped round him. For a moment Skinner stood astonished. \"Well, this is cheek!\" he exclaimed. \"Easton, look here; here is a beast of a native squatting in my hut. Sentry, what the deuce do you mean by letting a nigger come into my hut? Now, then, who are you? What do you want? What[Pg 276] do you mean by it? Out you go sharp, or I will break your neck!\" The two young officers, for Easton had joined his friend, stood astounded when the native broke into a yell of laughter. \"He is mad, Easton; he is a mad nigger who has escaped from a lunatic asylum!\" Skinner exclaimed. \"Don\u0027t go near him; perhaps he bites, and you might get hydrophobia. How is this, sentry?\" he asked, turning to the soldier, who had come up to the door. \"How is it you let this mad nigger come in here?\" \"I did not see him come in, sir,\" the sentry said; \"he must have slipped in when my back was turned. I saw an officer come in half an hour ago, but I haven\u0027t seen anyone else.\" \"Well, move him out, sentry; prod him up with your bayonet if he won\u0027t go.\" The sentry was about to enter the tent when Rupert gasped, \"That is enough, Skinner; order him out. You will kill me with laughing.\" \"Clinton!\" The word broke from the lips of Easton and Skinner simultaneously, while the sentry almost dropped his rifle in surprise at hearing his officer thus addressed in pure English by the native. \"It is all right, sentry, you can go,\" Easton said, recovering himself first from his astonishment; and then saying as soon as they were alone: \"What on earth does this masquerade mean, Clinton? have you gone out of your mind?\" \"Then you think I shall do, Easton?\" \"Do!\" Easton repeated, the truth dawning upon him. \"You don\u0027t mean to say that you are going to carry out that scheme you talked about a month since?\" \"Indeed I do, Easton. I have obtained the chief\u0027s permission. Major Kitchener is making the arrangements for me, and I hope in another three days to be out on the desert again. At any rate you will allow that as far as appearances go I can pass fairly as a native.\"[Pg 277] Skinner had not yet spoken. He now walked round and round Rupert two or three times, and at last gave vent to his feelings: \"Well, I am jiggered! There is no doubt about your disguise, Clinton, at least if you are Clinton and not a nigger who has stolen his voice. Did you ever see such a head of hair, Easton?\" \"Never mind that,\" Easton said impatiently; \"don\u0027t you understand, man, that Clinton is going away among those Arabs to search for his brother?\" \"No, I did not understand; in fact I did not hear a word that was said. I was too much stunned to do anything but stare. And you are really going, Clinton, old fellow?\" \"Yes, I am off to-morrow at daybreak for Korti. There is a good strong breeze blowing, and I shall go up as quickly as I came down. There was a delay of three or four days before we could get hold of the man I am to go with, if he will take me, so I ran down here partly to get some dyes for my skin in the bazaar here, but principally to say good-bye to you both. My wig, that so astonishes you, Skinner, I had made at Cairo and sent up.\" \"Well, there is no fear, Clinton, of anyone recognizing you as an Englishman. You may ride in the middle of them from here to Khartoum, and they would never suspect you as far as looks go. You have abandoned that idea about your tongue, I hope?\" \"Yes. I have got a bottle of caustic from one of the surgeons. He put me up to it. He says if I see that I am suspected, if I slip aside and rub one of these little sticks of caustic over my tongue it will make such a sight of it that I have only to open my mouth and let them look at it, and they will believe readily enough that I have got some frightful disease in my tongue and cannot use it. In case of necessity I can mumble out a few words, and the state of my mouth will quite account for any difficulty they may have in understanding me.\"[Pg 278] \"Will that stuff you have got on your skin wash off?\" Easton asked. \"Yes, this will with a little difficulty; but I have got some other stuff that my interpreter tells me will only want renewing once a week or ten days.\" \"Then for goodness\u0027 sake set to and get it off, Clinton, and put on your own clothes and let us see you again as you are. I don\u0027t seem to be able to talk to you naturally in that disguise, and it will be a long time before we get another talk together.\" Rupert at once set to work with soap, water, and a nail-brush, and in a quarter of an hour got his face and hands tolerably white. Then he put on his uniform. \"Now you are yourself again, Clinton. Sit down and tell us all about it. What are your plans?\" Rupert told him the arrangements that Major Kitchener was making for him, and both his companions greatly approved of the purchase of the fast camels. \"That is a capital idea, and if you can get a good start with them you may laugh at Arabs who are mounted on ordinary camels or on foot; but you must mind that there are no fellows with horses about when you make your bolt. You see, all these fellows who led the attacks were mounted, and I suppose you will find that a few of the principal men in every large village have horses. Now a horse will go faster than the fastest camel for a bit, although the camel will beat him in a long-distance race. What are you going to do about arms?\" \"I cannot take any arms, Easton; they would betray me at once.\" \"You cannot show any, I grant, but there is no reason in the world why you shouldn\u0027t take a brace of revolvers. They could be stowed away easily enough, with a couple of boxes of cartridges, somewhere in the saddle. There is room to hide anything in one of these great clumsy contrivances. Of course pistols would be of no use to you if you are discovered in the middle of a tribe or a big town; but if you find your brother,[Pg 279] and you make a bolt for it together on these camels and are pursued, you could make a pretty good fight against half a dozen mounted men, and the betting is against more than that getting together, if you had a revolver apiece. I should advise you most strongly to take them.\" \"I think you are right, Easton: I will certainly do so.\" \"Have you got a brace?\" \"No, I have only one.\" \"Then you shall have mine, old fellow. What calibre is yours?\" \"·45.\" \"Ah! that is the same as mine. I have got a couple of boxes of cartridges, and as they are done up in india-rubber they are sure to be all right. By the way, is it true that we are all going down? There was a rumour last night that orders had come.\" \"Yes, we are to retire to Wady Halfa.\" \"What! and abandon Dongola?\" Rupert nodded. \"Then I call it a beastly shame. More than that, I call it a downright dishonourable action!\" Easton said hotly. \"Here we are going to abandon a town of some twenty thousand inhabitants to these fanatics. Not only that, but to give up to their vengeance all the tribes between Wady Halfa and Metemmeh who have trusted in our promises, have thrown in their lot with us, and have for the last four months been doing all our transport. Our fathers used to be proud to call themselves Englishmen, but, by Jove, there is very little reason for us to be. That Boer business was shameful and humiliating enough, but this is worse still. I don\u0027t say that we are bound to go on to Khartoum, although it would be the best and cheapest and most satisfactory mode in every way of settling this Mahdi and ensuring order in the Soudan; but I do think that we are bound to hold the river from Korti downwards to protect the tribes that have been friendly to us, and to save this town from[Pg 280] ruin and desolation. Not only this town, but all the peaceful villages down the river. Besides, so long as we are here the Arabs will see that the Mahdi is not all-powerful, and may sooner or later rise against his tyranny. Well, I never thought this campaign was going to end in the disgraceful abandonment of the Nile Valley from Korti to Wady Halfa. However,\" he went on, checking himself suddenly, \"it is of no use talking of that now; we have got to think about your expedition, which to us three is a far more important business. How does your Arabic get on?\" \"Fairly well. I don\u0027t say that I can talk a great deal, but as I have learnt it by ear I speak with a fair accent, at least so Ibrahim says. I have taken particular pains with what you may call salutations, such as one man gives another as they pass each other on a journey, or what one says on entering a house or a village. I can ask for food all right, return thanks for hospitality, ask the way, and all that sort of thing; and Ibrahim said that in all these things I could pass very well as a native, especially as there are slight distinctions and differences between the language of the various tribes. They are a very mixed people, of Arab, Egyptian, and Negro blood. So that as far as it goes my language will pass, and of course every day I travel I shall improve. I intend, as I have said, to pretend to be dumb whenever we come across strong parties of strangers, and my sheik will shield me as much as possible by sending me out to look after the camels and to gather wood and to fetch water, or on other business, whenever we are with strangers. I really think, Easton, I have a very fair chance of getting through it without being found out. Major Kitchener tells me that the sheik only has two or three of his tribesmen with him, and that he has no doubt picked men he can trust to hold their tongues, otherwise he would get into a mess when he went back again among his people. Of course the men will be promised a reward also if I get safely through. The trouble on my mind is more the difficulty there will be in finding[Pg 281] Edgar and getting him off than about myself. In the first place there is no saying as to the direction in which the men who have got him have gone. They have probably gone to some out-of-the-way place, so as to be out of the way of the Mahdi\u0027s people. \"Ibrahim tells me that there are no people more pig-headed than these Arabs, and if they once make up their mind to a thing nothing will turn them. That is all the better, as far as the risk of Edgar falling into the hands of the Mahdi is concerned, only it makes it all the more difficult to find him. There is no saying where he may have moved to; he may have gone far south of Khartoum, he may have pushed away near the borders of Abyssinia, he may be within a few miles of Suakim, he may be in the desert we crossed. I don\u0027t disguise from myself that it is likely to be a long search; but that is nothing if I am but successful at last. Of course the great thing will be to endeavour to pick up a clue near Metemmeh. \"The tribe is a very scattered one, and is to be found dispersed among other tribes all the way from Berber to Khartoum on the eastern side of the river, and I hear that there is a branch of it who live in the desert to the west. Well, it is likely that Edgar\u0027s master will have stopped in some of these villages among his own people, if only for a few hours, and it is from them I hope to get some clue as to the general direction at least in which they were travelling. Unless they disguised Edgar, and wrapped him up as a woman, or something of that sort, the fact of a white prisoner passing through is certain to have caused talk. However, it is impossible to say where or how I may find a clue. \"At any rate I shall stick to it. I shall tell my father, that as it may take me a year to find Edgar he need not even begin to feel anxious until the end of that time, and that as I shall be continually improving in my knowledge of the language, the risk of detection will become less and less every month, and that I anticipate no difficulty whatever when the[Pg 282] time comes in passing down to Suakim or Massowah, or should any difficulty arise in that direction, in either working down to Wady Halfa or through Abyssinia.\" They sat and talked until far into the night, and then lay down for a few hours\u0027 sleep, and at daybreak Rupert said good-bye to his friends and took his place in the boat, which, spreading its sails, rapidly made its way up stream. The two friends stood for a long time looking after it. \"By Jove, Clinton has turned out a fine fellow,\" Skinner said; \"a grand fellow! I hardly thought he had it in him. Of course I knew he was plucky, and all that sort of thing; but this is a tremendous undertaking.\" \"It is,\" Easton said. \"Of course now the die is cast I would not say a word last night to discourage him; but the risk is tremendous. However he is going about it in the right spirit, and somehow I feel almost confident that he will pull through it, and that we shall shake his hand in England again. May God protect him on his journey!\" Skinner responded with an earnest Amen, and then they walked slowly back to the camp. As soon as he arrived at Korti Rupert made his way to Major Kitchener\u0027s, and was greeted with a cheery welcome by that officer. \"Things are going well, Clinton. I have bought the two riding camels. I was a whole day haggling over the price with the chief. I had to pay a stiff price after all, but that I expected. But it won\u0027t come quite so heavy, because he wanted to take it out in goods, and as we don\u0027t mean to take all the things back to the coast again, I got an order from the chief for our quarter-master\u0027s department to sell me a lot of rugs, cooking pots, and tin goods, and also some powder and ball and a dozen muskets. As I get them cheap the camels won\u0027t cost you more than half what they would if you had had to pay in silver for them. In the next place, the sheik arrived yesterday afternoon and I had a long talk with him.[Pg 283] He is willing enough to undertake the business and to wander about with you for as many months as you may choose, and to assist you in getting off your brother if you find him, if he thinks that you can disguise yourself well enough to pass as a native, but of that he is to be the judge. He won\u0027t take you at any price unless you satisfy him in that respect.\" \"I think I can do that, major,\" Rupert said. \"I will go back to my tent and dress now. I took in my two friends of the Guards, and I think I can pass inspection even by a native.\" In half an hour Rupert returned in his native get-up, carrying as usual a spear and a sword and two or three knives stuck into his girdle. Major Kitchener was inside his tent, and Rupert squatted down outside and awaited his coming out. When the major issued from his tent his eye fell upon him. \"Hullo!\" he said in Arabic, \"what do you want? Where do you come from?\" \"I am my lord\u0027s servant,\" Rupert replied in the same language. \"Yes, that is all very well, but I suppose you want some thing.\" \"I am ready to go for my lord to Khartoum, and to bring him news.\" Major Kitchener shook his head. \"I don\u0027t want to send anyone up at present,\" he said; \"we know all about it.\" \"Then you think I shall do, major?\" Rupert said in English. \"Bless me!\" the officer exclaimed; \"is it you, Clinton? I did not suspect you for a moment. You will do, lad, you will do. The sheik himself won\u0027t know you to be white with that wonderful head of hair of yours. It is a splendid imitation. One would think you had scalped one of these natives and put his hair on. Come along with me. You will see how we shall take in the sheik.\" He went across to a small group of camels by the side of which a sheik and two natives were seated talking and gesticulating violently. The sheik rose to his feet as they came up[Pg 284] and began to talk volubly; he was evidently in a rage with his followers, for he pointed to them with open hand and was complaining of their conduct. Presently they began to interject angry denials, and then sprang to their feet and excitedly poured out their view of the question. Rupert could not catch a word, and had no idea of the subject of the dispute, although he saw that Major Kitchener was listening with some amusement. The combat rose higher and higher. At last, with a sudden gesture, the sheik, who had looked furtively at this disguised stranger several times, seized the two men by the arm and whirled them round until they faced Rupert, who was leaning on his spear. \"There!\" he shouted. \"Where are the eyes you boast of? You say that anyone could in a moment detect a white man through his disguises. What! are you then blind or idiots that you do not see that this is a white man standing here?\" The Arabs stood motionless, wondering and incredulous, while the chief broke into a triumphant laugh at his own superior sagacity. \"Is he white?\" one of the men asked, turning to the major. \"Yes, this is the officer who is to travel with you.\" \"What is it all about, major?\" Rupert asked as the three natives proceeded to walk round him and examine him from every point. \"The sheik was declaiming against the obstinacy of his followers. He really wants to take you, and was in vain trying to persuade his men that such clever people as the whites could disguise themselves so that they would not be known. The two men protested against the risk, and maintained that anyone could tell a white from a native a mile off. Really the sheik did not suspect you in the slightest, but I thought it was well to let him have a triumph over his followers, and so as he was going on I gave a little nod towards you and he caught it at once; but I could see at first he thought he was mistaken, and while the others were having their say I nodded to him and said, \u0027Yes it is he.\u0027\"[Pg 285] With many interjections: \"It is wonderful! Can such things be! Eyes have never seen it!\" the three Arabs had continued to gaze at Rupert while the officer was speaking. \"It is a white man,\" the sheik said at last; \"there is more flesh on his limbs than on those of a young Arab. But who ever saw such hair on a white man; by what miracle did it grow thus?\" \"It is what is called a wig,\" Major Kitchener explained. \"It was made for him at Cairo; he can take it off and on. Take it off, Clinton.\" Rupert pulled off his wig and stood before them in his closely-cropped head. The natives made a step or two backwards in astonishment and awe. \"The whites are great people,\" the sheik said; \"they can turn a white man into a black. They can put an Arab\u0027s hair on to their heads, so that they can take it on and off like a turban. It is well, my lord, we will take the young officer with us; but he must remember that though when he is standing still he may look so like an Arab that no eyes could detect him, it is the movements and the ways and the tongue, and not the skin and hair only, that make a man. He will have to keep a watch always over himself and be ever careful and prudent, for were he discovered it would cost him his life, and would go hard with us also for bringing him as a spy into the land.\" \"We know that, sheik,\" Major Kitchener said; \"and all that has, you know, been considered in the handsome terms we have offered you.\" \"If he spoke the language as you do, my lord, it would be easy.\" \"It will not be long before he does so, sheik; you will see that he speaks with a fair accent already. Just suppose that you are the sheik of a village and that he has come in to get something. Now, Clinton, begin with the usual Arabic salutations.\" Rupert at once addressed the sheik, and the usual ceremonial[Pg 286] salutations which precede all conversation were exchanged between them. \"I have wandered from my camp,\" Rupert went on; \"my camel has travelled far, and I am hungry and athirst. I would buy meal and dates for my further journey, and a feed of grain for the camel,\" he continued, with a dozen other sentences that he had committed to heart and gone over scores of times with Ibrahim. The sheik nodded his approval. \"It is good,\" he said. \"For a time, as you have said, he will not talk, but will go as an afflicted one who has lost his speech, but even now he could pass through a village with us without exciting suspicion. We will take him. What say you?\" he asked his followers, who replied together, \"We will take him.\" Then there was a long discussion in Arabic between the sheik and Major Kitchener. \"He has seen your camels,\" the major said turning to Rupert, \"and wants them thrown into the bargain when it is all over. I have told him that this is quite out of the question. The terms I have already agreed upon are ten times as high as he could earn with his camels in any other way; besides it is, as I pointed out to him, probable that you and your brother may have to ride away alone on the camels. But I have said that if you should arrive together at any port or place where the sum agreed upon can be paid to him, and if you are thoroughly satisfied with the way in which you have been treated, you will let him have them, deducting from the amount to be paid half the sum that you have just given for them, and as you paid for them in goods that will really be about the price they cost you.\" \"That will be an excellent arrangement,\" Rupert said; \"the hope of getting the camels at the end of the journey will certainly be a great inducement to him to be faithful. I know that the Arabs think as much of these fast camels as we do of race-horses at home. And will you tell him too that if we have to leave him and take the camels, I will see that[Pg 287] they are left, to be given up to him on his arrival, at some place he may name. I think that it would be as well that he should feel that he will get the camels anyhow in addition to payment; otherwise the temptation to seize them might be so great that he might get rid of me on the first opportunity.\" \"Yes, that would be as well, Clinton. A pair of such camels as these are certainly a great temptation to an Arab. I have great faith in this man, for he was very highly recommended to me by some Egyptian merchants at Cairo who had travelled with him right down to the great lakes. At the same time it is always better to throw no temptation in people\u0027s way. He wanted a portion of the money down, but I would not hear of this. I said that he knew he was certain of it when the duty was performed, and that therefore there was no reason whatever for his making any demand beforehand, except that he should have a sum just sufficient and no more to enable him to pay any expenses he might incur for his own food and that of the camels. That is little enough: dates, meal, a kid sometimes for the men, and an occasional feed of grain for the camels, who as a rule pick up their own living except when engaged on hard work.\" What Rupert had said was explained to the sheik, who, although he showed little outward satisfaction, was evidently pleased with the prospect of some day owning the two fast camels. There was now a long discussion between Major Kitchener and the sheik as to the best route to be pursued, and the probabilities as to the course that Edgar\u0027s captors had followed, and then the conference broke up, the sheik saying his camels required another two days\u0027 rest, and that on the third day at daybreak he should be ready to start. At the last moment Rupert suggested, that as the Arabs had, they said, two spare camels before, and would now have three, he should present them with a sufficient load of rugs, powder, and other things they valued to form light loads for the three spare animals. There would be nothing suspicious in their possess[Pg 288]ing such goods, as many of the loaded camels had, especially on the night march to Metemmeh, strayed away or fallen, and their loads had been plundered by the Arabs. For twenty pounds he could get from the quarter-master\u0027s stores plenty of goods for the purpose, and as these could be used for barter it would obviate the necessity of carrying silver. The offer added to the good temper of the sheik and his followers, and as Rupert walked back to Major Kitchener\u0027s tent with him the latter said, \"I think, Clinton, you have won your fellows fairly over. I could see by the way they discussed the routes to be followed, that they have got thoroughly interested in the matter themselves, and will throw themselves heartily into it. I really think you have a very fair chance of getting through this business safely. I did not think so when you first proposed it to me, but the difficulties seem to have disappeared as we have gone on; and now that I have seen you in disguise, I think that, unless from some unforeseen accident, or some forgetfulness on your own part, there is no reason why you should not travel with those Arabs from end to end of the Soudan.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3124/85929.html","bookId":900,"book":{"id":900,"title":"The Dash for Khartoum","description":"简介： The story of the Nile Expedition is so recent that no word of introduction is necessary to the historical portion of the tale.
