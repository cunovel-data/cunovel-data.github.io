{"id":13320,"no":21,"title":"CHAPTER XX. FOUND!","content":"Before starting upon their journey the sheik said to Edgar, \"On our journey here we travelled by unfrequented tracks, and it was sufficient to cover you up so that none who passed us should notice you; but it will be different now, therefore we must dress you in our own fashion. Your hair can never be made to look like ours and must be bound in a turban. With that and a burnoose your face and hands only will be visible. These are now so darkened by the sun that their fairness will scarce be noticed, but the women will prepare a dye which will darken you to our shade. I wish you to dress like us for another reason. You have done us great service, and though you will not change your religion I regard you almost as one of the tribe, and do not wish you henceforth to consider yourself as a slave. You are improving fast in our language, and if you speak but little you will pass unnoticed. Some men are more silent than others, and you need speak but little when strangers are with us. As one of ourselves you will attract less notice than as a slave. None will say, \u0027Where did you get that fellow? To what part did he belong? Was he brought from the Great Lakes? Are you inclined to sell him? He is a likely youth. What will you take for him?\u0027\" \"I am ready to do what you think best, sheik,\" Edgar said, \"and indeed there can be no doubt that I am far less likely to be noticed if wrapped up in your fashion than if I went half clothed as a slave.\"[Pg 341] Accordingly a low close-fitting turban was wound round Edgar\u0027s head, and he was wrapped up in loose cotton garments covered with a burnoose, the hood of which came over his head. His face, hands, and neck were slightly stained, and when this was done the Arabs admitted that they would not for a moment have suspected him of being other than he seemed. Most of the women, children, and old men were left behind at the wady; the goats and sheep would supply them with milk and cheese; there was a sufficient supply of grain for their use until the crops that had been sown as soon as they arrived should come into bearing; and when all preparations were complete the party started on its way. It consisted of twelve men mounted on camels, while two other animals followed behind each of these. The sheik rode at the head of the party upon the horse that had been captured from the Mahdists. Amina also had a camel to herself, while the four other women who accompanied the party rode two on a camel. Yussuf and five or six lads of from fifteen to seventeen years old walked by the side of the camels. The led camels were but lightly loaded, carrying only the tents, cooking utensils, provender for the journey, and food and water for the party; and Edgar could see no reason why Yussuf and the boys should not have ridden, except that it was the custom for slaves and lads to walk. It was a six days\u0027 journey to the point they aimed at, and the marches were long ones. The supply of water carried was ample for the wants of the party, and the camels were given a good drink before starting on the fourth day\u0027s journey. They were turned loose each evening on arriving at a halting-place, and left to pick up what subsistence they could from the bushes, a good feed being given to them each morning from the provender they carried. As they could have carried much more, Edgar inquired why enough had not been brought to give them a feed at night as well; but the Arab of whom he had asked the question said that it was better for them to browse[Pg 342] at night, as the moisture in the herbage enabled them to do with much less water than if they had been fed entirely upon grain. Edgar was very glad when the desert journey was over. The glare of the sun from the sand and the rocks was almost blinding, and the wraps in which he was muffled up greatly added to his discomfort. On arriving at the cultivated land the same picture presented itself that he had seen near Khartoum. Everywhere the villages were almost entirely deserted and the fields lay waste; the blighting influence of the Mahdi seemed to weigh upon the whole country. The few natives that remained fled in fear at the sight of the strangers, and the old people they met with in the villages were crushed with grief and despondency. Of what use to cultivate the land when the Mahdists might at any moment sweep off the crops? Even should they gather the grain, where could they sell it? There were markets indeed still open, but the Mahdi\u0027s tax-gatherers would demand a proportion of the proceeds, which would sweep away all their profits. What was to become of them Allah alone knew. Edgar was filled with pity for these poor creatures, and over and over again thought with astonishment of the policy which, after sending a force to within a short distance of Khartoum amply sufficient to have crushed the Mahdi and to have restored peace and comfort to the population of the Soudan, had withdrawn them when the goal was all but reached, and left the unhappy people to their fate. After journeying for some days they passed a plain strewn with skeletons. \"You see these,\" the sheik said; \"they are the remains of the army of Hicks Pasha. Here they were attacked by the Mahdi\u0027s army. They defended themselves bravely, but they could neither advance nor retreat, and at last they were vanquished by thirst and fatigue. They were slaughtered as they stood. Hicks Pasha and a band of officers rode right into the[Pg 344][Pg 343] midst of the Mahdists, and died fighting there. There were, I heard, two or three Kaffirs with him, besides many Egyptian officers. The black troops fought splendidly, but the Egyptians made a poor stand; but it came to the same in the end. What could they do against the followers of Allah!\" THE ARMY OF HICKS PASHA ON THE MARCH. THE ARMY OF HICKS PASHA ON THE MARCH. \"But the Egyptians are followers of Allah too,\" Edgar said, \"and yet, as you say, they are but poor fighters. No, no, sheik; I admit the extraordinary bravery of the tribesmen. I fought against them at Suakim and saw them charge down upon our square at Abu Klea. They had no fear of death, and no men ever fought more bravely. But it was a matter of race rather than religion. Your people have always been free, for the rule of Egypt was after all a nominal one. The Egyptians have been slaves for centuries and have lost their fighting power. In the old, old days, thousands of years ago, of which we have records in our sacred book, and which we have learned from other sources, the Egyptians were among the most war-like of people and carried their arms far and wide, but for many hundreds of years now they have been ruled by strangers. It was not very long ago that our people fought a great tribe in the south of Africa—a tribe who knew nothing of Allah, who had in fact no religion at all, and yet they fought as stoutly and as well as your people have done here. It is a matter of race. They were just as ready to die as were your tribesmen, and that not because they believed, as you do, that death in battle would open the gates of paradise to them, but simply because it was the will of their king.\" \"Mashallah!\" the sheik said, stroking his beard, \"they must have been brave indeed to throw away their lives if they knew nothing of paradise, merely at the will of one man. That was folly indeed. A man has but one life, it is his all; why should he part with it? Did they love this king of theirs?\" \"I do not know that they loved him,\" Edgar said, \"but they feared him. Their laws were very cruel ones, and it was death to turn back in battle.\" \"They had better have cut his throat and have gone about their own business,\" the sheik said. \"Why should one man be master of the lives of all his people. Is this so among the whites?\" \"It is so in some countries, but not in others,\" Edgar said. \"Some countries are ruled over by men chosen by the people themselves, and the power of peace and war and of making laws of all kinds is in the hands of these men, and the king has very little power. In other countries the king is absolute; if he says it is war, it is war.\" The sheik was silent. \"But why should people fight and die because one man tells them?\" he said after a pause; \"it is astonishing.\" \"But it is just the same thing with the people here and the Mahdi,\" Edgar said; \"he tells them to fight, and they fight; if he told them to scatter to their homes they would do so.\" The sheik made no further remark, but it was evident to Edgar that he was thinking out the problems that had presented themselves to him, for some hours afterwards he suddenly remarked, \"We who live in tents and wander where we will are the only free men; it is more clear to me than ever.\" When they were within a day\u0027s journey of El-Obeid they met one of the sheik\u0027s followers who had left the wady four days before the rest with instructions to go to the city and find out whether it would be safe to enter. He halted his camel when he reached that of the sheik. \"You must go no nearer the city, my father,\" he said. \"I have learned that orders have been received by the Mahdi\u0027s governor to arrest you and all with you should you present yourselves there. There is much talk about a party of soldiers who went into the desert to arrest you having disappeared altogether; others have been sent to find them, but have discovered no traces of them, so there are orders that any of our tribe from the desert are to be closely questioned. Any who[Pg 345] admit a knowledge of you are to be sent to Khartoum. I was questioned at the gates, but as I said that I had come straight from Khartoum and knew nought of what was passing in the desert I was passed in without further inquiry. I took up my abode with the people you told me of, and they have found out for me what I have told you. It is but three days since the orders concerning you were received.\" \"I thought there might be danger at El Obeid,\" the sheik said calmly. \"We will turn off so as to avoid the city, and will make south to join the white pasha. For a while it would not be safe anywhere here.\" Without further words he turned his camel from the track they had been following, and bore away more to the south. \"Think you that the white pasha will be able to maintain his position?\" The sheik shook his head. \"For a time he may, but in the end he must either surrender or try to strike down to the sea. His troops will weary at last even if they are not beaten by the army the Mahdi will send against them. They will say, \u0027Why should we go on fighting? What good can come of our holding out when no aid can possibly reach us from Egypt?\u0027 The Mahdi will be glad to come to terms with them and allow them to live there in quiet with their wives and families and their possessions, if they will acknowledge him and hand over the white pasha with the two or three white officers he has with him. But that will make no difference to me. I know all the country by the Great Lakes. There are Arab traders there in plenty who buy slaves and ivory and take them down to the coast. I can find employment with them for my camels, and can stay with them until it is safe to return. This cannot go on for ever. Besides, in times of trouble events pass quickly out of men\u0027s minds, and in a year the Mahdists will have forgotten my name. As to the loss of their forty men, what is it? They have lost thousands since the war began.\"[Pg 346] \"When we get to the white pasha, sheik, would you hand me over to him if he offered you a ransom for me?\" \"No,\" the sheik said decidedly, \"I should not take you near him. Why should I part with you? You have brought us good fortune. Thanks to you we defeated the Mahdists and captured their camels and all that they had. Besides, I like you. Why should I part with you? What good would it do you? With me you are no longer treated as a slave, but as one of my own people. What would you be with the white pasha? An officer of his troops, getting no pay, and running the risk of being one day seized and sent with the others a prisoner to Khartoum.\" \"I have no desire to stay with the white pasha,\" Edgar said; \"I would rather be with you than in so hopeless a position as he is; but I might make my way down to the coast?\" \"Never,\" the sheik said; \"at least never alone. There are fierce tribes between the lakes and the sea. No white man could get through alone. He could only do it by going with a great band of fighting men and carriers, and by buying his way by presents through the great tribes and fighting his way through the small ones. You may travel down to the sea some day with me if I join the caravans of the Arabs, and then if there are countrymen of yours on the coast, as I have heard, and they would pay me a good ransom for you, we may see about it. You are ungrateful to wish to leave me.\" \"Not ungrateful, sheik, for you and your wife have treated me with great kindness; but it is natural that one should wish to go to one\u0027s own people. Had you been taken a prisoner and carried to England, however well you were treated you would sigh for your free life in the desert, for your people and friends, and would escape if you saw a chance. It is human nature to love the land where one was born, whatever that land may be.\" \"That is true,\" El Bakhat admitted; \"but you cannot escape now; there is nowhere for you to go to.\"[Pg 347] \"That is true, sheik; and I should be well content did I know that you were travelling straight either for Suakim or Zanzibar, for at either place I know that I could obtain from my countrymen money to pay any ransom you might set upon me, even a sum that would buy you fast camels and much goods, and make you a wealthy man in your tribe; but I am not content to wait for years.\" \"You are not thinking of making your escape now?\" El Bakhat asked, looking scrutinizingly at Edgar under his heavy eyebrows. \"No, sheik,\" Edgar answered. \"From the day that you captured me I made up my mind that I would escape sooner or later, whatever the risk; but I knew well that I could never traverse the country until I could speak the language like a native. I have made great progress, and can now understand all that is said and can talk freely and easily, but not so that I could travel alone as a native. It will be months yet before I can do that. Nor, after the kindness with which you have treated me, would I leave you suddenly without warning. When I feel that I can safely travel alone I shall give you fair warning. I shall say to you, Sheik, if you will now travel with me to Suakim or some other port where I can obtain money for paying you a fair ransom I will remain with you until such ransom is paid into your hands; if you will not do so I shall consider myself free to escape when I can. Of course it will be open to you to treat me again as a slave, and to use all vigilance to prevent my leaving you, but I shall consider that by giving you fair warning I shall be free to use my best endeavours to get away.\" \"You speak boldly,\" the sheik said, \"but you speak fairly. Do you give me your promise not to attempt to escape until after warning me?\" \"Yes, I give you that promise, sheik.\" \"It is well,\" El Bakhat said gravely. \"I know that you would not lie to me. After you have given me warning I shall[Pg 348] know what to do.\" So saying he got up and walked away to his tent. Three days later, as the caravan was halting at a well, Yussuf, who had gone out with the camels, ran in. \"There is a large body of men, some on foot and some on horses, approaching from the south.\" \"How far are they off?\" the sheik asked as he leapt to his feet. \"Scarce half a mile,\" the negro replied. \"Then it is too late for flight,\" the sheik said, reseating himself; \"they would be here long before we could saddle our camels. It is doubtless a body of the Mahdi\u0027s troops, but if they come from the south they will have heard nothing against us.\" When the Mahdists rode up the sheik rose and saluted their commander. \"Who are you?\" the officer asked. \"I am an humble person, one El Bakhat of the Jahrin tribe, travelling with my camels and some little merchandise.\" \"Have you the permit of one of the Mahdi\u0027s officers to trade?\" \"No, my lord, I did not know that it was needful.\" \"Assuredly it is needful,\" the officer said. \"Your camels and goods are forfeited, and you yourself and your people must travel with us to El-Obeid, where inquiries will be made about you.\" \"My lord,\" the sheik said, \"I am a poor man and have done no harm. After fighting against the infidels I went back to my people with such spoil as we had taken and have dwelt there quietly, and was ignorant that it needed a permission for me to journey with my camels.\" \"Well, if you can prove that when you get to the city,\" the officer said, \"the governor may take a lenient view of the case, and may content himself by taking a portion only of your camels as a fine; but if you are lying it will be worse for you.[Pg 349] Remember now that you are prisoners, and will be shot down if one of you attempts to escape.\" The sheik bowed submissively. The officer ordered some of his men to keep a rigid watch over the prisoners, and then paid no further attention to them. The sheik re-entered his tent and sat down stern and silent without speaking. Amina, who had heard what had passed, was in the greatest state of alarm, but saw that her husband was not to be spoken to at present. She went to the door of her tent and beckoned to Edgar, in whom she felt the most implicit confidence. \"You heard what has passed, Muley?\" \"I heard, lady; the position is full of danger.\" \"You are fertile in expedients. Can you not suggest some thing? You see if we are taken to El-Obeid, where they have had news of the expedition sent from Khartoum, and its disappearance in the desert, my husband would be sent in chains to the Mahdi, and you know what his fate would then be, while the least that will befall us all will be to be sold into slavery. What then do you advise?\" \"With your permission I will think it over,\" Edgar replied. \"The position is a difficult one; the danger is, as you say, great.\" \"Go, then, and think it over, Muley.\" Edgar went out of the tent and squatted down (a position which had at first been very fatiguing, but to which he was now accustomed) by the embers of the fire before it, and thought over what had best be done. For himself, he felt sure that he could make his escape, for though a general watch might be kept, one man could doubtless crawl away in the darkness; but he felt that he could not abandon the sheik in a moment of danger. It was, in fact, owing to himself that the sheik was now in his present position. It was true that the Arab had refused to give him up to the Mahdi\u0027s people at Metemmeh, not from any love towards him, but of[Pg 350] his own obstinate and headstrong disposition. However, that refusal, whatever its motive, had undoubtedly saved his life; and, moreover, the sheik had behaved with great kindness to him since, and he felt that it was clearly his duty to do all in his power to assist him now; but how? It was upwards of an hour before he rose from the fire and again entered the sheik\u0027s tent. The sheik was sitting smoking gravely. Amina was baking some bread over the embers in the middle of the tent. \"What is your counsel, Muley?\" she asked. \"I see no plan,\" he said, \"by which my lord can get away with all his followers and camels. One or two might steal out from the camp, and I thought at first that if Yussuf and myself—who would not be so closely watched as he will be, for there are two sentries outside the tent—could manage to steal out with our guns and to open fire in the darkness upon the camp, the Mahdists, thinking they were attacked, would seize their arms and run out, and in the confusion my lord and you and some of the others might make their escape. But this plan is full of danger, and it might not succeed, for they might suspect that those who attacked them were of your party, and a portion would remain to keep guard over you. This, then, should be the last resource, for if the attempt was made and failed, escape would be more difficult than ever. \"It appears to me that the first thing to do is to try and bribe the chief. At present he only suspects you of trading without a license, and were my lord to see him and to offer him half the camels and the burdens, to let him go free with the remainder, he might accept it. If that failed, we can still try my plan. I would take my gun and crawl out with Yussuf. I would go two or three hundred yards away to the right, and would then fire as quickly as I could, moving while I did so; so that they might think that there were many attacking them. Then, my lord, in the confusion you and your wife with the child should try to make your escape. As soon as the camp is[Pg 351] aroused and they are advancing against us we would move round to the left of the camp, and you would join us there and make straight across the country and be far away by daylight.\" \"But how could we travel without camels?\" the sheik broke in impatiently; \"they would surely overtake us before long.\" \"There are deserted villages in which we might hide until the pursuit is over,\" Edgar said. \"As they would gain all the camels and goods it would matter little to them that three or four persons had escaped.\" \"Not until they reached El-Obeid,\" the sheik said. \"Then they would learn who we were, and would scour the country for us. Camels we must have if we are to escape. Besides, I should be a ruined man, and might as well be killed at once.\" \"Not altogether ruined, sheik,\" Edgar said. \"You remember that we buried many of your valuables and arms at the wady.\" \"We could never get there without camels,\" the sheik said gloomily. \"It might be done, sheik. Several men accompanied the camels on foot, and we could perform the journey so on our way back; but I should not counsel that. My idea was that we should get as far away from here as possible, and should then leave your wife and child in some village. We could take with us goods which would be quite sufficient to ensure a welcome for her until you return. Then I should propose that you and I with Yussuf, who is certainly faithful, should make our way down on foot as Arab fighting men to Berber, and then on to Osman Digma, who is, we know, close to Suakim. Thence we might readily find means of escaping him and entering the town, and then, as I told you, I can promise you a ransom that would enable you to buy more camels and goods than you have lost here, to return to your wife and child and take them with you to your wady. As to camels, I do not altogether despair of getting some. They are, as usual, grazing outside the camp, they know Yussuf\u0027s voice and mine, and when we first escape[Pg 352] we might lead four of them away and take them to the left of the camp, where you are afterwards to meet us. Before morning we could be very many miles away.\" \"Ah! if you could do that!\" the chief said, showing for the first time a lively interest in the matter, \"it might be possible. However, I will try first of all if the officer will accept a bribe. If he will do so it will give us two days\u0027 start, and we can then arrange matters as you say.\" Without another word he rose and went to the door of the tent. The two sentries placed there stepped forward and told him that their orders were that he was not to leave it. \"I wish not to leave it,\" he said; \"I desire only to speak to your commander. I have something of importance to say to him. Will you pray him to come to me?\" One of the sentries at once went across to the commander\u0027s tent and shortly returned with him. \"Master,\" the sheik said, \"I have done wrong in journeying without a license, but I came from the desert and did not know the law. I must pay for my fault, though I cannot think that the commander at El-Obeid would be hard upon one who has erred from ignorance. However, as it is urgent for me to press on my journey, I will relinquish to you one-third of my camels and their burdens if you will let us travel on with the others, and give us a permit from yourself so that none may molest us in future.\" As the officer had no suspicion that the Arab\u0027s first story was untrue he hesitated; then he said, \"Not so; all your camels are forfeited for breaking the laws of the Mahdi.\" \"But those who err in ignorance are surely not punished like those who err wilfully,\" the sheik urged. \"But I am pressed for time. I am journeying south to the tents of my wife\u0027s father, who has sent to say that he is sick unto death and wishes to see her before he dies. Be content, my lord, and take half the camels.\" The officer thought that the offer was a good one. It was probable that the governor of El-Obeid[Pg 353] would not fine the Arab more than half his camels, seeing that he had broken the law inadvertently, and in that case he himself would have but a small share in the spoil; whereas if he consented to the proposal, the camels would all fall to himself, saving one or two he might give to his officers to induce them to keep silence as to the affair. \"I will be more merciful than you deserve, Arab,\" he said; \"I will take half your camels with their loads; but see that you cheat me not; if you do, it will be worse for you. Divide the animals and goods to-morrow morning in two equal parts. I will take that which pleases me most. I have spoken;\" and turning upon his heel he went back to his tent. Edgar, standing within, heard the conversation. \"You have heard,\" the sheik said when he had entered; \"half my property is gone, but I have freedom and the other half. I have had worse misfortunes than this. So far your counsel has turned out well, Muley. Now about the future. We shall have but four days\u0027 start. He will reach El-Obeid by evening the day after to-morrow. There he will hear that he has let slip through his fingers the man for whom all the country is in search, and horsemen will be despatched instantly in pursuit; probably they will be here the next evening; it is but a reprieve. Journey as fast as we will they will soon overtake us.\" \"Yes, if we pursue our course in the same direction, sheik, but this we must not do. I should say that as soon as the division is made we should start south; it is as well that they should see the direction in which we are travelling. Then as soon as we are well out of sight of the camp I should say let us break up the party into six or eight parts and bid them travel in different directions east and west, and then make to the point where we arrived from the desert, and strike across to the wady. A party like ours would be noticed at once, but two or three persons each with a camel carrying their belongings would be scarce observed; and the Mahdi\u0027s horsemen, asking if a caravan of ten camels had passed, would be[Pg 354] told that no such party had been seen. At any rate most of your men would be able to regain the wady and there to await your return. Then I should propose that you on one camel and your wife and child on another, with such goods as you require to pay your way, with myself on foot dressed as formerly as a slave, should strike in the direction of Khartoum, but keeping this side of the river until we reach Berber. Of course you could take Yussuf with you or not as you might choose; but I think that you would find him useful.\" \"You would like him to go?\" the sheik asked in a tone of suspicion, for it flashed across him that if Edgar and Yussuf made common cause he would be at their mercy. \"I should like him to go, sheik. The negro has always been civil and obliging to me from the day when I thrashed his companion, and if when we arrive at a port on the Red Sea you are willing to part with him I will gladly arrange to buy him of you at any reasonable price that you might name.\" \"So be it,\" the sheik said; \"the matter is settled.\" Next morning the sheik and his followers were on foot early. They divided the camels with the greatest care into two portions, debating earnestly on the merits of each animal; then the goods, which were of but trifling value, were also divided. When all was done the Mahdi\u0027s officer came down and closely inspected both lots of animals. \"There is nothing to choose between them,\" he said; \"you have made a just division. I will take the right-hand lot, and the horse is of course mine;\" and to the disgust of the sheik he ordered one of the followers to take it to his tent. \"Here is a permit for you to journey and trade as you will.\" The soldiers were already under arms, the Arabs hastily packed their tents and cooking-pots on the camels that remained to them, and the two parties set off almost at the same instant in two opposite directions. When they had travelled for an hour the sheik halted his caravan and explained the situation to his followers.[Pg 355] \"As soon as the Mahdists reach the town they will hear of us, and hot pursuit will be instantly set on foot; therefore it is necessary for the present to abandon our plans and for you to return at once to the wady from which we started. But if our pursuers obtain news of a caravan of our size they will be sure to overtake us; therefore it is also necessary that we should separate at once. Let each man, therefore, take his camel, his wife, and his belongings, and journey singly. Let some go east and some west, and making a circuit to avoid El-Obeid reach the edge of the desert as best you may. Do not wait there for each other, but let each as he reaches it strike across to the wells. When you reach the wady wait there for me. I go with my wife and Muley and Yussuf. We shall take two camels and journey north. There I hope to obtain a sum for the surrender of Muley, which will more than repay us the loss we have suffered to-day.\" The Arabs at once obeyed the orders of the sheik and in a few minutes were speeding across the country. \"We will go on for another three or four hours\u0027 march,\" the sheik said, \"before we turn to the east. Our pursuers will be sure to inquire for us at every place they pass, and if they hear that solitary camel men have been seen making their way across the country they will turn off at once in pursuit. It is therefore better that they should move off some distance before we turn off.\" The sheik had chosen two camels which, though not remarkable for their looks, were of better blood than the rest, and more capable of performing long journeys. He and his wife and child rode on one of the animals, Edgar with Yussuf behind him on the other. At noon they turned off from the southern course they had before been pursuing. They continued their journey until long after sunset, and then halted for a few hours to rest the camels. The moon rose at eight o\u0027clock, and as soon as it was up they started again, travelling now in a north-easterly direction in order to throw their pursuers off their track. At daybreak[Pg 356] they halted again, this time in a grove. A fire was lit and Yussuf cooked some meal cakes, and a bountiful feed of grain was given to each animal. As speed was less an object than secrecy no move was made until nightfall, in order that they might pass through the villages unobserved. The journey was continued until the following morning, when they again halted. They were now following a track which would, the sheik said, lead them after a few miles into the main road between El-Obeid and Khartoum. This time the halt was of but a few hours\u0027 duration, as they hoped that they had baffled their pursuers and could now travel without attracting any special attention. They had reached the road and were proceeding along it when Yussuf saw dust rising in the distance. He called the attention of the sheik to it, and the camels were pressed forward to their utmost speed. But camels will seldom go far beyond their accustomed walk; and it soon became apparent that they were being rapidly overtaken by the strangers who were pressing on behind. By this time it could be seen that the party following them were also mounted on camels. Two riders had detached themselves from the main body and were coming on at a rapid pace. \"They must be mounted on heiries,\" the sheik said; \"see how they come along! There is no avoiding them.\" \"They are not the Mahdi\u0027s men,\" Yussuf said presently; \"I can see by their dress that they are in Arab robes.\" \"They are riding for a purpose,\" the sheik said, \"or they would not travel so fast, and yet if their purpose were hostile they would hardly leave their followers so far behind. If they know aught of El Bakhat they will know that he is not a man to surrender without resistance. Prepare your gun, Muley. Methinks there are but two men with the four camels behind, and if we slay these first we shall have no difficulty with them.\" IT IS RUPERT\u0027S VOICE, BUT IT CANNOT BE RUPERT! \"IT IS RUPERT\u0027S VOICE, BUT IT CANNOT BE RUPERT!\" The strangers came rapidly up, and as they approached the sheik saw that they were an Arab trader and a wild-looking[Pg 357] native. As they came up they reined in their camels and the trader gave the usual Arab salutation, which was responded to by the sheik. Two or three of the usual ceremonial sentences were repeated on both sides. \"My brother\u0027s name is El Bakhat?\" the new-comer said. \"My name is my own,\" the sheik replied, \"and is no concern of strangers.\" \"I come as a friend,\" the Arab said. \"I arrived at El-Obeid yesterday and heard that a body of horsemen had set out in pursuit of you. Yesterday evening some returned with a prisoner, who said that your party had separated and that you were travelling north. Two parties of horsemen were ordered to start at daybreak. Thinking that you might make for Khartoum, I set out at once to warn you.\" By this time the wild-looking young native had slipped from his camel and walked up to Edgar, staring fixedly at him. Edgar, not knowing what to make of the movement, shifted his rifle forward, when the native gave a wild cry, \"Edgar!\" Edgar gazed at him with stupefaction. It was Rupert\u0027s voice; but how could this wild figure be Rupert? how could he be here? \"Edgar, do you not know me? I am Rupert!\" Edgar could doubt no longer. He flung himself from his camel and rushed into his brother\u0027s arms. \"Am I mad or dreaming?\" he exclaimed, as he still failed altogether to recognize Rupert in his disguise. \"It is Rupert\u0027s voice surely, but it cannot be Rupert.\" \"It is me, sure enough, Edgar; and you are neither mad nor dreaming.\" \"But this hair?\" Edgar said, still bewildered, gazing at the wild, unkempt locks. \"It is a wig, neither more nor less, Edgar, made for me at Cairo; and a first-rate job too.\" Edgar could doubt no longer, but with the certainty and joy[Pg 358] a strange weakness seemed to come over him, and he would have fallen had not Rupert seized him. \"Stand up, old boy; it is all right, and natural enough. We heard at Metemmeh of your having been carried away, and as of course I wasn\u0027t going to let you remain a slave among these fellows, I got leave of absence from Wolseley, got a disguise and a first-rate guide, and, thank God, I have come to you at last.\" The surprise of El Bakhat at seeing this meeting between Muley and this young native was much greater than that of the other Arab, who had heard at El-Obeid the evening before that the white slave was journeying in disguise with his captor. \"This is my brother, sheik,\" Edgar said to him. \"He has come all this way in disguise to look for and rescue me.\" \"He has done well,\" the sheik said warmly, while Amina clapped her hands in pleasure. \"Is the story about the pursuit after us true?\" Edgar asked. \"Yes, quite true. The horsemen will not be many hours before they overtake us.\" A hurried consultation was held between the two sheiks, and it was decided to strike off to the south-east again, and as soon as the followers arrived with the camels the united parties left the road and made across the country, Edgar taking his place on the camel behind Rupert. He still felt like one in a dream, and even now could scarce believe that it was really Rupert who was riding before him. The latter, who had been looking forward to the meeting, was yet scarcely less surprised at what had taken place. It had seemed such a hopeless task looking for Edgar over so wide an expanse of country that he could scarcely credit that he had succeeded in finding him, and for a time the feelings were so deep on both sides that hardly a word was spoken. It was not, indeed, until the camels came to a halt late in the evening that they began to talk naturally.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3124/85933.html","bookId":900,"book":{"id":900,"title":"The Dash for Khartoum","description":"简介： The story of the Nile Expedition is so recent that no word of introduction is necessary to the historical portion of the tale.
