{"id":23677,"no":49,"title":"CHAPTER XLVIII","content":"Of what else was done by the General Pero Alvarez Holguin, and how he departed from Cuzco. \\n\\n \\n\\n IN previous chapters we related how Pero Alvarez Holguin was received in the city of Cuzco as General, and how Don Alonso de Montemayor had arrived there with despatches from Don Diego. Although he had written word of his coming, and that he had been sent by Don Diego, confidence was not felt in Don Alonso. The Adelantado Almagro had always thought highly of him, and he went with the Adelantado to Chile; moreover, he was on his side at the battle of Las Salinas, so it was feared that he might try to gain men over to Don Diego\u0027s party. He tried, indeed, to slip away from Cuzco, because he was told, before Pedro Anzures arrived, that some men who were not on very good terms with himself, were coming from the town of Plata in that leader\u0027s company, and he feared, in those troublous times, they might seek to kill him. Hence he tried to escape. But Pero Alvarez presently took measures to keep him in hand, and ordered his arrest, treating him liberally as his position deserved. \\n\\n \\n\\n Pedro Anzures having arrived, and the captains having been appointed, it was found that the force numbered 300 men—including mounted pikemen, arquebusiers, and musketeers. News had come that his Majesty had appointed[164] the licentiate Vaca de Castro to be Judge, and that he had actually arrived at Buenaventura, and must by now be at Quito. So leaving a sufficient force behind to uphold Justice in the King\u0027s name, it was decided to set out from Cuzco with the intention of giving battle to Almagro and his followers if they should cross their path; while, if not, they would march on until they could join Vaca de Castro wherever they might meet him. They began the march to Guamanga in good order, always throwing out scouts to reconnoitre in case there should be signs of an enemy\u0027s approach. \\n\\n \\n\\n Were one ordered to enumerate the great evils, injuries, robberies, oppression and ill-treatment inflicted on the natives during these operations, without exaggeration, there would never be an end of it, for they took no more thought about killing Indians than as if they were useless beasts, nor stopped to consider that Christ, our God, was placed on the Cross for them as well as for us. If the captains wished to place some check on such great evils they were powerless to do so; for in past disturbances and civil wars soldiers have always held to robbery and profit. If a remedy was attempted they mutinied, and passed over from one camp to the other; or they stayed away in the villages, if they were not allowed to follow their own devices. In very truth we may in some measure acquit them of blame, for the country is so rough and so devoid of beasts of burden that many must travel afoot, through having nothing to ride. There are also uninhabited wilds where it is necessary, owing to the great cold, to carry tents and means of subsistence, so that where it is done with moderation, I would not condemn the employment of Indian carriers. But since my readers know what I can vouch for, I do not wish to say more on this subject than that if a man had need of one pig he killed twenty, if four Indians were wanted he took a dozen. To speak quite plainly, there[165] were many who made the poor Indians carry their public women in hammocks borne on their shoulders. \\n\\n \\n\\n After leaving Cuzco the General Pero Alvarez Holguin travelled until he reached Guamanga, where Don Diego\u0027s deputy was one Vasco de Guevara. He, fearing that he might receive some ill-treatment, absented himself from the city, and concealed himself among the mountains. But some soldiers sent out by Pero Alvarez to search for him, found him, and brought him back. Then Pero Alvarez got himself accepted as General in Guamanga, and after he had established order and settled the city in the service of His Majesty he departed, accompanied by some citizens and others who were soldiers from that city. General Pero Alvarez followed the royal road of the Incas, marching always with scouts in advance, until he arrived within half a league of Parcos. He then desired all the captains, cavaliers, gentlemen, and soldiers gathered under his banner to acknowledge him afresh as their General and swear him in as such. This public solemnity was there celebrated. They then discussed what should next be done. Some said that they should go and give battle to Don Diego, who had already left Lima, as we shall presently tell. Others disagreed, saying that it would be better to continue their march to Caxamarca, where they would obtain news of the Judge, and, in conjunction with his men, they would be strong enough to resist the enemy, who had been busying themselves only with increasing their forces, and renewing their arms. Finally they agreed to continue their journey, and join forces with Vaca de Castro and with the captain Alonso de Alvarado. \\n\\n \\n\\n Alonso de Toro, the citizen of Cuzco, pretending that he was going back in search of some Indian girls, left the camp. They say that the citizens of Cuzco were dissatisfied with the nomination of Holguin as their General, and that this person had some quarrels here with Don Pedro Puerto[166]carrero; and things came to such a pass that Holguin took his horses and arms away and would have turned him out of the camp. The other captains intervening, however, peace was restored; and Alonso de Toro came back into camp, and they continued their journey. We will now leave them, and speak of the departure of Don Diego from Lima. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971/56462.html","bookId":729,"book":{"id":729,"title":"The War of Chupas","description":"简介： Pedro de Cieza de Len was, on the whole, the most important historian, and is now the best authority, on ancient Peru, so far as his work has reached us; for he was a great traveller, and an eye-witness of much that he described....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM"}}
