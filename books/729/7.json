{"id":23635,"no":7,"title":"CHAPTER VI","content":"How the captain Jorge Robledo sent Gómez Hernández to explore the province of The Choco, and also how Ruy Vanegas went to the village of Pirsa. AFTER the captain Jorge Robledo had ordered the spoils that were taken in the house I mentioned to be restored to the Indians, and established a peace with the Chiefs of the valley of Apia, which was the largest and most populous of the districts subject to the city that had[15] been founded, he received news that Ocuzca and Umbruza, with other Chiefs, had sworn to destroy the new city and kill all the Spaniards. So he decided to proceed to Santa Ana de los Caballeros, for so the city was named, as we stated when we recorded its foundation. He arrived there after a few days, and despatched messengers in all directions urging the native Chiefs not to be mad, nor to act without considering the consequences, but to render obedience to his Majesty and be friendly to the Spaniards, and in such event he would secure to them their lives and possessions, and would see that they were not ill treated. Some of them thought it best to comply, and came, bringing materials for building the houses of the Spaniards. Robledo now wanted to divide the villages among the Spaniards who had come with him. He had news that, beyond the cordillera of Cima, which lies to the north of Anzerma, there was a thickly peopled region and much wealth. So, to ascertain the truth, he resolved to send and explore. He ordered Gómez Hernández to set out with fifty Spaniards, cross-bow men and shield bearers, and explore this region of El Choco. When they were ready the captain Robledo went with them as far as the valley of Santa María. Here an Indian came in friendly guise, alleging that he was the Chief, Umbruza. As he was known not to be that Chief he was ordered to be burnt, which was an excessively cruel punishment. Gómez Hernández left this valley with the Spaniards, but took no horses with him because of the rugged character of the country, and proceeded until he reached the forest of Cima, which is very wild, with a dense growth of trees, and where it rains during the greater part of the year. It contains many noxious animals and night birds. The monkeys are numerous, and the natives go naked and are very savage. The Indians have their houses very strongly built in trees, and they make war upon each other owing to[16] the scarcity of food. The Spaniards with their cross-bows came to one of those barbacoas, or fortified places, and one of them named Alonso Pérez caught an Indian girl. She was so overcome with grief and abhorrence at finding herself a prisoner to a Christian, that she threw herself down a precipice and was dashed to pieces, her soul going to hell. Gómez Hernández advanced for some days through these forests, than which there are none more rugged and impassable in the world, until he came to a river which flowed into the Ocean Sea and which, according to the most general opinion, must be the river of Darien.[21] They found some edible palms, and on them that singular fruit called pixibays, which they liked. There also were many turkeys and pheasants,[22] and many tapirs which are the size of a mule, and would seem to be like those they call zebras. Proceeding with his discoveries, Gómez Hernández advanced until he arrived at the crest of a rise whence they saw that the country everywhere appeared level and much less mountainous. No open plain was visible, but undulating country with many and much larger barbacoas or fortified houses than had been found in Cima. When the natives perceived the Christians they sounded many drums and flutes, making a great noise and preparing to come out and give battle. These Indians also go naked but they are well disposed, their women beautiful, and they all have gold. It is believed that there are great riches in these regions, but until now they are unexplored. Gómez Hernández, and all his followers, being unmounted, were in some danger of falling into the hands of the Indians who, seeing that they had come without horses, which are what they so greatly fear, held the intruders cheap, and rose up in arms to oppose an entrance into their country. The Spaniards had reached[17] one of those strongholds, and in it they found plenty of food, and wanted to take some of it. But the Indians came against them, thinking to lay hold of them. When the Spaniards saw their approach, they commended themselves to God, and prepared for battle. Then came a great disaster, which was that the cords of several cross-bows were broken. The Indians shot off arrows and darts and the battle was joined. The Spaniards fought well, though some did better than others, and many were wounded by the Indians. The affair reached such a point that the Indians, after having mortally wounded a Frenchman who was there, seized Antonio Pimentel, a veteran in these Indies, who was near, gave a tremendous shout, and transfixed his body with a dart. This Pimentel, and another named Vera, were saved miraculously. For being desperately wounded they commended themselves to our Lady and, though many Indians passed by, it was her pleasure that they should not be perceived by them, and so, strengthened by her aid, they were able to rejoin their comrades. The Spaniards, being without horses, seeing the number of Indians increasing, and most of themselves wounded, thought it best to retreat with their faces to the foe. They were followed for a whole day when the Indians, satisfied at having driven the enemy out of their country and wounded most of them, returned. The Indians had captured the wounded Frenchman, and put him to a most horrible death by cruel tortures. The Spaniards made speed to return to Anzerma, and report to the captain what had happened. Robledo then ordered Ruy Vanegas to proceed to the village of Pirso and try to arrange for terms of peace with the Chiefs. Ruy Vanegas set out with those that were necessary, and with horses, and I went with him. When we arrived at the place we found the natives in arms. They had deep holes dug in the approaches, and in them were many spikes.[18] These holes were covered over with grass, so that the horses and Christians might fall into them. As we entered the village the Indians fled into the ravines and among the rocks behind the village. Because a horse fell into one of the holes and was killed on the stakes, the Spaniards threw into two of them over fifty Indian men and women, to teach them not to try another deceit like that, as it would be to their own hurt in the end. After having been some days in this district, Ruy Vanegas had sent messages to the Chiefs to come as friends, and we went on to the province of Sopia. Here, though the barbarians were proud, yet, knowing the power of the Spaniards, they came in peaceably and gave obedience to his Majesty, which they have observed ever since. After Ruy Vanegas had settled those provinces he returned to Anzerma, and reported to the captain what he had done.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971/56420.html","bookId":729,"book":{"id":729,"title":"The War of Chupas","description":"简介： Pedro de Cieza de Len was, on the whole, the most important historian, and is now the best authority, on ancient Peru, so far as his work has reached us; for he was a great traveller, and an eye-witness of much that he described....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM"}}
