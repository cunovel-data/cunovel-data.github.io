{"id":23719,"no":91,"title":"CHAPTER XC","content":"How the General, Felipe Gutiérrez, and the Camp-master set out from Cuzco, and how Diego de Rojas went to explore in the direction indicated by the Indians. THE General Felipe Gutiérrez and the Camp-master Nicolás de Heredia had remained in the city of Cuzco, and, as soon as Diego de Rojas departed, they sent the Spaniards outside, because, being in small parties, they would gain supplies more easily, and the Indians would suffer less hardship. When everyone else had gone, the captains departed likewise. It is very commonly the case[318] that the men who roam about this country are ill disposed, friends to turmoil and enemies of concord, without having any reason for breeding strife; and thus, some of those who had arrived at the place where Diego de Rojas was waiting told him that Felipe de Gutiérrez was coming with some of his friends, and harboured an intention of murdering him, when they arrived, so as to gain the sole command. Diego Rojas did not fail to be disturbed on hearing what we have said, but, being a prudent man, he did not believe it to be altogether true, nor did he put all suspicion aside, but took warning to look out for himself. As those who were with him were eager to go forward with the expedition, he ordered forty Spaniards to get ready to go with him, at the same time writing to Felipe Gutiérrez to make haste and join him. He left Diego Pérez Becerra in charge of the camp, and secretly instructed Pero López de Ayala to go back and meet Felipe Gutiérrez, ascertain his intention and proceedings, and report the result to Diego himself. Pero López de Ayala went, with three mounted companions. As soon as these messengers had departed, Diego de Rojas left Chiquana and, guided by what the Indians had told him, made his way over pretty difficult country until he reached a province called Tucumá,[152] which lies beyond the cordillera of the Andes, and at the foot of very rugged hills, which, however, are not more than four leagues across. To reach this province they followed down the course of a stream. The distance from there to Chiquana, where the camp was left, is fifty leagues. In some parts of this province there are dense forests; the rest is open plain, and there the Indians have built round houses of heavy timber framing, thatched with straw.[319] The natives knew of the coming of the Spaniards, rumours of it having spread far and wide, but they had not the courage to oppose them. On the contrary, they fled from their homes like cowards, through fear of the invaders. When Diego de Rojas arrived at Tucumá and found that the natives did not come out to him, having intelligence of a more populous district farther on, he decided to continue his march to another village called Capayán. The Chief of that place, when he heard that the Christians were coming, ordered 1,500 of his vassals to assemble, all loaded with straw, besides carrying their ordinary weapons. When they came near to where Diego de Rojas and his comrades were advancing, the Chief ordered the straw to be laid down as a mark beyond which the Spaniards must not advance, and warned them that if they passed it they would all be killed, for that they had no right to invade the land which belonged to the Indians and had been in their occupation without let or hindrance for many ages. The captain Diego de Rojas, seeing what the Indians did and said, told his companions to be mounted and ready for whatever might happen, as he wanted to speak to the natives, and to explain to them the cause of his coming. After the Chief had made his speech, all the Indians took up their bows and arrows, while Diego de Rojas, moving to where the Chief stood, explained that he and those other Christians were subjects of the Emperor Don Carlos, and that they came from other places where he also was lord. If the Indians would believe in our God, and have the Emperor for their natural lord and king, there would be peace and true friendship between them; if not, war could not be avoided until, forced by necessity, they themselves should pray for peace. Diego de Rojas made them understand this through the interpreters present. The Chief, and those who had come with him, answered by repeating what they had said before, being astonished[320] at seeing the horses and their swiftness of foot, and at the appearance of the Spaniards and their being so silent. After spending a short time in contemplating them, the Indians made up their minds to approach Diego de Rojas, and presently, by gathering round him, tried to cut him off. He was by no means off his guard, but, understanding the Indians\u0027 cunning, he chided them for what they had done, and told the interpreter to repeat what he said, to the Chief. The Chief replied that his Indians were so ill-behaved that even when he gave an order they would not obey, nor give up doing what they were about. When Diego de Rojas heard this, he put spurs to his horse, and began capering about in all directions. The natives were astounded at seeing the swiftness of the horse and the fury with which it galloped. The Spaniards, when they saw that their captain no longer held discourse with the Indians, pointed their lances, and charged among the Indians, and began to drive them into their naked bodies. When the latter saw that the game was up, they began to run away in great terror. Diego de Rojas ordered the Spaniards to cease the slaughter, because the Chief had been sorry for the impudence of his people. When the Spaniards heard the order, they desisted from wounding those who had fallen, and the Indians also refrained and gave heed by command of their Chief.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971/56512.html","bookId":729,"book":{"id":729,"title":"The War of Chupas","description":"简介： Pedro de Cieza de Len was, on the whole, the most important historian, and is now the best authority, on ancient Peru, so far as his work has reached us; for he was a great traveller, and an eye-witness of much that he described....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM"}}
