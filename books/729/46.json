{"id":23674,"no":46,"title":"CHAPTER XLV","content":"Of the things that were done by Captain Alonso de Alvarado after he had raised the banner of the King. \n \n IT has already been related how the captain Alonso de Alvarado held it to be a great injury to the service of the King that the Marquis Don Francisco Pizarro should have been put to death; and here he had raised the banner in the royal name, and collected troops to strengthen his position in the highlands where he was awaiting the arrival of the President Vaca de Castro, who, it was now publicly known, was coming as Judge of residencia in the affairs of Almagro and Pizarro. As the news spread, Don Diego de Almagro and Juan de Herrada wrote to persuade Alvarado to espouse their side, to which he answered as already stated. When it became known in the cities of Trujillo and San Miguel that Alonso de Alvarado had raised the banner in the name of the King, some joined him who, holding the deed done by Don Diego in abhorrence, did not wish to be on a side which would support his party or agree in its views, but were unanimous in the service of the King. When Alonso de Alvarado knew that García de Alvarado had gone to Piura, he wished to rout him before he could return to Lima; for if this could be achieved it would be a great disaster for the men of Chile, who had such confidence in his prowess. With this determination Alvarado ordered a soldier named Carrillo, who had gone to Trujillo for arms, as we have related, to proceed to Caxamarca, where Melchor Verdugo, and to Guamachuco, where Aguibera, were proprietors, and had some parties of Indians who knew the country well, to get them to help him, as he wished to defeat[156] and kill García de Alvarado and those who were with him. Verdugo wished to be neutral, by what they say, and answered Carrillo equivocally. They also say that when García de Alvarado passed by there, he brought him one or two very good horses and some arquebuses, and that it was by Verdugo\u0027s advice that García de Alvarado hurried his departure. And furthermore, that although Verdugo received letters from Alonso de Alvarado calling upon him to join, he would not do so. \n \n When Alonso de Alvarado found that he had not managed to entrap García de Alvarado, knowing that a great force was being assembled at Lima to march against him and to find the Judge Vaca de Castro, he decided to depart from the city where he was, to join the Judge, who was believed to be now in Quito. He marched as far as Cotabamba, where he halted because he deemed the place strong, and one which could not be attacked by his enemies, and whence, should they come in force, he could retreat further inland. He then sent other messengers to Vaca de Castro, reporting that he, Alvarado, and his followers were well, and urging the Judge to come quickly, because as soon as the masses knew of his arrival in the Realm many would come forward to join him and serve the King. \n \n Let us now leave Alonso de Alvarado, and say that after the captain Pero Alvarez Holguin had arrived at the city of Cuzco, and been publicly received there as General and proclaimed by the sound of trumpets in the great square, he devoted himself to preparing arms and getting men together. When Pedro Anzures arrived he did the same. Don Alonso de Montemayor then arrived in that city. He had come by order of Don Diego de Almagro to speak to Holguin on his behalf. He was to say that he was aware of the movements which were taking place; that, putting other things aside, Holguin should conform to his party; and that as he had always shown himself a[157] friend of the Adelantado Almagro and his supporters he should now be one of the avengers of his death. If Pero Alvarez had not entered Cuzco he should take the city for him (Don Diego); and, collecting all the arms and men possible, he should then return to Lima. Don Alonso did not put forward any of these arguments, for when he arrived at Cuzco he found Pero Alvarez within, and although he spoke some things to him on Don Diego\u0027s part, he, like a prudent cavalier, was very guarded in what he said, and evinced a desire to serve the King. But Pero Alvarez arrested him for the time being, and had a secret watch kept on him to prevent him from returning to Lima. \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971/56459.html","bookId":729,"book":{"id":729,"title":"The War of Chupas","description":"简介： Pedro de Cieza de Len was, on the whole, the most important historian, and is now the best authority, on ancient Peru, so far as his work has reached us; for he was a great traveller, and an eye-witness of much that he described....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM"}}
