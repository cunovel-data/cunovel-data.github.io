{"id":23709,"no":81,"title":"CHAPTER LXXX","content":"Of things that were done by the Governor Vaca de Castro, and how he despatched some captains to undertake conquests in the Realm. \\n\\n \\n\\n THE Governor Vaca de Castro was in the city of Guamanga, quite complacent at seeing the ditch under the gallows full of dead bodies, and the fine blood of Spaniards being shed in that square. This was no little pleasure for the natives to see also, though they were amazed on reflecting that many of the victims had been captains and men holding posts of honour. They carried the news of all this to the King Inca Manco Yupangue at[288] Viticos, where he was staying; and although he was glad that so many Spaniards had been killed, he regretted that Vaca de Castro was the conqueror and Don Diego was defeated, whilst pleased that it was left for himself to protect the young Almagro from the cruelty of Vaca de Castro. Having sent Garcilaso de la Vega to the city of Cuzco, as we have related, it occurred to Vaca de Castro that there were a great many people collected in Guamanga, that the provisions were being consumed, and that the citizens and other inhabitants were being unduly put to straits. So he decided to order some of those of his army to leave it. Presently he instructed Pedro de Vergara to go, with such followers as he required, to the province of Bracamoros, of his own conquering, where he had already done good service for his Majesty. He granted warrants and encomiendas there to Vergara and many others, desiring them to set out as soon as they could get ready. Vergara desired nothing better and, as soon as the wounds he had received in the battle were healed, he made his preparations to depart. Orders were also sent to Juan Pérez de Guevara, who was then at Lima, to proceed to the province of Moyobamba and settle it. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Governor also wrote to all the cities of the Realm directing that if any of the men of the Chile party should seek refuge in them, they were to be arrested and put to death. He ordered the bodies of all who fell in battle on his side to be interred in the churches at Guamanga, and arranged that a hermitage should be set up on the battle field, for the invocation of our Lady of Victory, where the rest of the dead had been buried. The captain Pedro Anzures, and the others who were wounded, recovered. The municipality of Guamanga made a request to Vaca de Castro that he would confirm certain things in his Majesty\u0027s name, and that the city be thenceforward called \"of the Victory,\" instead of, as heretofore \"of the Frontier,\" a[289] request which the Governor was pleased to grant, and so it is called at the present day. Notwithstanding that several vessels were detained in the port of Lima by order of Vaca de Castro, and that leave was asked for permission to depart for Tierra Firme, he would not grant it, which was felt to be no small grievance. After he had made various arrangements, and given permission to those who wished it to return to their houses, Vaca de Castro set out for Cuzco, leaving the licentiate De la Gama in the city to complete his judicial work. He had not gone more than two leagues when he turned back again, so as to reach Guamanga at break of day, without letting those who were with him be aware of it. When he appeared again in the great square the people were astonished. This return was because many of those who escaped from the battle had hidden in some houses, and he wished to secure their arrest. This was soon effected, and they were delivered over to the licentiate De la Gama, who passed judgment on them. This being concluded Vaca de Castro continued his journey with those who were to accompany him to Cuzco. But as we must treat of the return of Gonzalo Pizarro to Peru, we will now tell how he got out of the Canela. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971/56502.html","bookId":729,"book":{"id":729,"title":"The War of Chupas","description":"简介： Pedro de Cieza de Len was, on the whole, the most important historian, and is now the best authority, on ancient Peru, so far as his work has reached us; for he was a great traveller, and an eye-witness of much that he described....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM"}}
