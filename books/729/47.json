{"id":23675,"no":47,"title":"CHAPTER XLVI","content":"How the President Vaca de Castro quitted Popayán, to go to the city of Quito. \n \n WE recounted in former chapters how, while the Licentiate Vaca de Castro was in the city of Popayán, Lorenzo de Aldana brought news of the death of the Marquis Pizarro in the city of Lima at the hands of the men of Chile, and how, when this was known to Vaca de Castro, he wrote to the Adelantado Don Sebastián de Belalcázar, who was then at Cali, desiring him not to go to the city of Cartago, nor to Anzerma for the present. Vaca de Castro was very anxious to know for certain if the news was true. At this juncture one Ordas, and Juan de Valdivieso, citizens of Cuzco, arrived, who, jointly with Diego Maldonado and other settlers in Peru, had embarked at Panamá for that Realm. When they had reached the coast of Peru they received the news of the Marquis\u0027s death; and, as the Judge had landed at the port of Buenaventura, they gave up their voyage further southwards, and went inland to[158] Quito to find him. Thence they went on to Pasto, and, together with Villalba, they proceeded to Popayán, where they found Vaca de Castro, and related to him what was going on; how Don Diego had assumed the r?le of governor of the realm; how he had sent one of his captains, named García de Alvarado, to range the coast, and even to get the Judge himself into his clutches in order to detain or kill him; how he had taken and killed Alonso de Cabrera and others, and had captured and carried back the Licentiate García de León a prisoner. When Vaca de Castro heard this news he became quite convinced that the Marquis had been murdered, and that Don Diego was set up as Governor. He wrote again to Belalcázar therefore, explaining that the Marquis had been murdered, and that Don Diego had shamelessly and insolently got himself installed as Governor, and had been so received at Lima. Vaca de Castro called upon Belalcázar, who had always been a faithful servant of his Majesty and was the King\u0027s Governor and Captain-General, to collect as many men and arms as possible and march to Popayán, where the Judge awaited him. \n \n People allege that when Belalcázar read this letter from Vaca de Castro, he was much worried, and that it was more from fear than from goodwill that he obeyed the summons. This seems likely, because he always showed himself lukewarm in whatever things occurred, and in the letters he sent to the cities nearest the coast he wrote that he was going back because he could not do otherwise, but would soon return. He had another reason for wishing to go down stream but not up, which was that according to positive news received at Cali, Captain Jorge Robledo, the founder of those towns and cities, with all those who had been his followers before, had espoused the royalist cause, and the Adelantado was anxious to arrest him. However, Belalcázar replied to the Licentiate that he would be happy[159] to come to Popayán at once and do what might be required of him, and that he would bring as many men as he could, although he then had very few in the city. He got ready as best he was able, and set out for the city of Popayán, accompanied by some of his servants and friends, and other inhabitants of Cali. At Popayán he was received by the President Vaca de Castro. \n \n Having assembled the principal people who were there, the Licentiate Vaca de Castro displayed a Royal Cedula of his Majesty, whereby it was decreed that if the Marquis Pizarro should die during Vaca de Castro\u0027s voyage to Peru, or after his arrival there, he, Vaca de Castro, was empowered to take over the government of the provinces and be his Majesty\u0027s Governor there, with the same full powers as those granted to the Marquis. When they had seen the Cedula there was some argument as to what had best be done to take the control from Don Diego, who held it against the royal will. There were some who advised that Vaca de Castro should go back to Buenaventura and thence to Panamá, where he might assemble a fleet and a large force with which to go in strength against the men of Chile and punish them for the crime they had committed in putting the Marquis to death and seizing the country. Lorenzo de Aldana was not of this opinion. He maintained that Vaca de Castro should take the road and enter Peru with all possible despatch; for although Don Diego had assumed the name of Governor, there were in Peru so many loyal subjects of his Majesty that they would not fail for any reason to enlist themselves in his service. To go to Panamá would cause much mischief, and would be of no use. After they had argued about what should be done, Vaca de Castro decided to go on to Quito, and ordered Belalcázar to go with him to Peru. While preparations were being made for the journey many copies were made of the royal Cedula of his Majesty, and despatched by[160] messengers to all parts that the President\u0027s coming might be known, as well as the will of his Majesty to the effect that in the event of the death of the Marquis, Vaca de Castro was to be Governor. Then, with the following he had, Vaca de Castro set out for Quito, taking with him Lorenzo de Aldana, who he expected would be very useful. Continuing the journey they came to Villaviciosa de Pasto, where they found several persons willing to go with the President to serve his Majesty. \n \n Then, when the messengers sent by Vaca de Castro from Popayán arrived at Quito, and the royal Cedula of the King our master was seen there, the Captain Pedro de Puelles, who was lieutenant there, and the alcaldes assembled in council; and they acknowledged Vaca de Castro as Governor, sending messengers to inform him, and offering to go with him until he should have carried out all that his Majesty had ordered. When the Governor Vaca de Castro learnt that he had been acknowledged at Quito he rejoiced at this good beginning, and pressed on with all speed to arrive there. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971/56460.html","bookId":729,"book":{"id":729,"title":"The War of Chupas","description":"简介： Pedro de Cieza de Len was, on the whole, the most important historian, and is now the best authority, on ancient Peru, so far as his work has reached us; for he was a great traveller, and an eye-witness of much that he described....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM"}}
