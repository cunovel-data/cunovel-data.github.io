{"id":23724,"no":96,"title":"CHAPTER XCV","content":"How the bachelor, Juan Vélez de Guevara arrived at Lima, where the municipality would not receive him; and of the departure of the accountant Juan de Cáceres for Panamá. \\n\\n \\n\\n THE reader will remember how, in previous chapters, we related that when Vaca de Castro heard of the arrival of Gonzalo Pizarro in Lima, and of how things were freely talked about between him and his followers, in a way that could not be overlooked, the Governor despatched the captain Juan Vélez de Guevara to that city (who had been in the battle at Chupas) to act there as his Lieutenant, and to remedy what had been said. Having quitted Cuzco the bachelor Juan Vélez arrived at Lima after Gonzalo Pizarro had already left that city. He presented to the municipality the commission he brought from the Governor Vaca de Castro by which the latter appointed him his deputy, and Captain over the city. The treasurer Alonso Riquelme, the accountant Juan de Cáceres, the factor Illán Suárez, and the councillors who were present, valuing highly the credit of their city, complained openly of Vaca de Castro in that, having amongst themselves persons of high quality who were known to be anxious for the King\u0027s service, he should send a stranger to be over them; and they agreed among themselves not to receive him. On this subject there were discussions in the Municipal[331] Chamber, and things came to such a pass that the bachelor was expelled from office and turned out of the Council. As he refused to submit to their ruling they laid hands upon him, with the approval of the Municipality, and broke the verge of office which he had brought. Thus insulted Guevara quitted the scene; but, as the councillors knew that Vaca de Castro was irascible and vindictive, they began to fear that some harm might come to them on account of what they had done. The accountant, Juan de Cáceres, not daring to remain until Vaca de Castro should arrive, departed in a ship for Tierra Firme. The other councillors and officers remained in great fear lest some evil should befall them, for having declined to receive Guevara. We will now resume the narrative about Felipe Gutiérrez and his companions. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971/56517.html","bookId":729,"book":{"id":729,"title":"The War of Chupas","description":"简介： Pedro de Cieza de Len was, on the whole, the most important historian, and is now the best authority, on ancient Peru, so far as his work has reached us; for he was a great traveller, and an eye-witness of much that he described....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM"}}
