{"id":23701,"no":73,"title":"CHAPTER LXXII","content":"How the Governor Vaca de Castro quitted the province of Jauja for the city of Guamanga, where the captain Diego de Rojas then was. \\n\\n \\n\\n AFTER the Governor, Vaca de Castro, had adroitly restored friendship between the captains Alonso de Alvarado and Pero Alvarez Holguin, and had distributed among the soldiers all the arms that were there, he addressed them, urging them to prove themselves strong men, and so firm that, by chastising the insurgents, the country might be free from oppression and his Majesty absolute lord of the land. For the despatch of business he brought with him as his secretary Pero López, a native of Llerena, as we have already said, and he ordered him to keep the letters which the licentiate de La Gama and the assessor Gonzalo Hernández had brought. And as the infantry had already begun to march out, an order was given to the cavalry to do the same, and the Guancas were requested, in friendly words, to provide Indians for carrying the munitions and camp baggage, which they did. When all was in order, the[255] Governor set out, with the royal standard of the eagle carried by Rodrigo de Campo. They marched in good order until they reached the village of Picoy, where they had a short rest, being anxious to get on to Guamanga, where Diego de Rojas had taken up a position and prudently built a fortress for his garrison to remain entrenched in if he should be attacked by the enemy. As it was thought certain throughout the Realm that there would be a battle between the factions of Pachacama and Chile,[119] public prayers were offered up, especially in the city of Lima, where they made great sacrifices to our God, the monks of all the orders going forth in processions, and praying for Divine aid, and that the victory might be given to Vaca de Castro, because he was waging war in the name of the king. The Spanish women, on their part, did the same, and fearing lest victory might fall to the Chile party, they put their goods and chattels on board the ships, intending, if the news should prove bad, to embark also themselves. \\n\\n \\n\\n Diego de Rojas received word that Don Diego was at Vilcas, and sent messengers to Vaca de Castro, urging him to come to Guamanga with all possible speed, to forestall the enemy\u0027s approach. When this news reached the Governor at Parcos it caused great excitement, as if the enemy were already charging lance in hand, and the alarm was given at once. The Governor, in a state of perturbation, went from place to place, ordering his troops to march off in haste and occupy Guamanga. He ordered Captain Pedro Anzures to rush back and call up Alonso de Alvarado, who had dropped behind with his company of lancers, as well as the rest of the people who were still on the road. Pedro Anzures went back and gave the news to Alonso de Alvarado, who presently arrived at Parcos. The Governor then advanced, going down by[256] the way where Juan Chico was killed, when the ill-fated de Morgobejo retired to die on the heights of Lunahuana. From there Vaca de Castro ordered Lope Martín to push forward on horseback to Guamanga and find out whether Diego de Rojas had any further news. He came back with the same news they had before. As some of the companies of foot had gone far ahead, the Governor gave orders for them to be halted until the whole force was together. At Vinaque he pitched the camp with them all united. From the scouts sent out by Diego de Rojas, the news came that Don Diego was marching down from Vilcas to occupy Guamanga. This report caused more excitement than the former one, and Vaca de Castro held a consultation with his captains, whereat it was decided to push briskly forwards so as to reach Guamanga before Don Diego could enter it. They began their march in great disorder, so that, if the enemy had been near, they would easily have been routed. On arriving at Guamanga, the various sections entered the plaza, and mounted the culverins they had brought with them, at the ingress to the streets. They remained there that night, and next day the truth was learned, which was that Don Diego was still at Vilcas, and had not started nor moved his men the distance of an arquebus shot. The Governor passed out from the city on the side towards Vilcas, the tents were pitched, and the captain Pedro Anzures arrived with the laggers behind and the baggage train, so that all were united. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971/56494.html","bookId":729,"book":{"id":729,"title":"The War of Chupas","description":"简介： Pedro de Cieza de Len was, on the whole, the most important historian, and is now the best authority, on ancient Peru, so far as his work has reached us; for he was a great traveller, and an eye-witness of much that he described....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM"}}
