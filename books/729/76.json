{"id":23704,"no":76,"title":"CHAPTER LXXV","content":"How the messengers returned to the camp at Vilcas, no way being found that could lead to peace, so that they had to trust to arms for the defence of their cause. WHEN the letters were given to Alonso García, neither Lope de Idiáquez nor the factor Mercado observed it, because the others took care that they should not know or understand. They left Guamanga with the letters and despatches they were given, and travelled until they reached Vilcas. The terms demanded by Vaca de Castro were then made known. He required the Almagro camp to be broken up, and that Martín de Bilbao, San Millán, Diego de Hoces, Juan Rodríguez Barragán, Martín Cote and the others who had been concerned in the death of the Marquis, should be given up to him; and promised that the fullest mercy would be shown to Don Diego in the name of his Majesty. To effect this settlement Juan Balsá was to go to Guamanga, and the captain Alonso de Alvarado was to come to Vilcas, so as to avoid by this plan the vast evils that would result if the war continued. The captains resolved to meet and consider what should be done, Don Diego and the messengers being also present at the consultation. After some discussion they decided to send Juan Balsa to offer that if Vaca de Castro would pardon the murderers, they would abide by his terms as regards everything else. While affairs were in a fair way to reach this conclusion, a letter came on the scene, which[263] Agamenon had written to Pedro de Candía, his father-in-law, inciting him to tamper with the artillery, for he saw that he had gone astray and was acting against the service of his royal Majesty, and warning him that, such was the strength of the Governor\u0027s forces, the Almagro party could not fail to be conquered, and that then they would be looked upon as traitors: and other things in like strain. This letter was brought from the aforesaid Agamenon by an Indian, and at the time when he delivered it, this Indian was asked whether any other Spaniard had seen the letter: he replied that the messengers had read it. Pedro de Candía, on reflection, then guessed that this was a snare laid to entrap him;[122] so without reading the letter he went straight to the consultation of officers which was just then in progress, where he showed the letter and read it openly. At this, the lives of the messengers came near being forfeited there and then: so monstrously indignant were Don Diego and the others on seeing that while in one hand they brought an appeal for peace, they craftily waged war with the other. In a raging passion all swore that they would conquer or die, ordering the messengers to go back with that for an answer, and tell the enemy to hurry up, and that neither they nor any other messengers were to return again with overtures, if they valued their lives. Thus was every way towards peace closed. The messengers did not dally, but promptly got their horses and were hustled out of the camp. Don Diego de Almagro, mounted on a powerful steed, ordered a general muster of all his men in the plaza, which occupied a triangular space between the ruined palaces and the temple of the sun. As they were all so fond of the youth there was little slackness in obeying his command, and stationing himself in the midst of them all, Don Diego thus addressed them: [264] \"Oh my companions and loyal friends!—I well believe that none of you are ignorant of the great merits, valour and liberality of the Adelantado Don Diego de Almagro, my father, or unaware that his was the first sword to reclaim from their savagery the multitude of barbarians in this region and in those which extend as far as the river Maule, thus bringing many of them under the Spanish yoke and into the royal service. He was the ladder by which the Pizarros rose, in recompense for which he was most cruelly deprived of his life. Afterwards, through lack of attention in Spain in providing for the administration of justice for which we waited, and finding, as was publicly known, that the Judge who was coming would be disposed only to add to our troubles and forlorn condition, and would not afford us justice (as he had been appointed through the influence of that warm befriender of the Pachacama party, Cardinal Loaysa) and seeing that we were denied on all sides the justice we had so long been expecting, it pleased God to lift the veil from his hidden judgments and, that they might be known now and for ever, to let the Marquis pay with his life for the death which through his cruelty and that of his traitor brother had been inflicted on my father. Well! since our Lord put such fortitude and spirit into your hearts that without difficulty you became indomitable men ready for any deed of strength, willing to suffer great hardships, hunger, cold and heat, I entreat you, in all earnestness, not to fail now, when fortune calls upon us to defend our lives and honour, which are poised but on the points of our lances and in the bullets of our arquebuses. Therefore I bid ye sally forth from this fort with willing heroism to seek out our enemies, and to let them understand the gallantry and courage with which our persons are endowed. And should it not please God to give us the glory of victory, we shall at least sell our lives at such a price that no one else will care to[265] purchase them, whilst winning perpetual fame by our deeds. Upon that soldier who shall bring me an enemy\u0027s head, from that moment I will bestow the lordship of his victim\u0027s repartimiento, and, if he should have been a married man, the victor shall step into his place in the marriage chamber, and enjoy the society of the widow.\" Young Don Diego had scarcely finished his speech when the soldiers, raising their right hands, shouted clamourously to be led to battle. So the camp was at once broken up and next day they marched to Pomacocha, a strong position, where they proposed to halt, and even to wait until they could know whether the enemy had quitted Chupas to offer battle at Sachabamba, a suitable, open plain where artillery could be effectively used. But as Death was now hovering over their heads, in their eagerness and impetuosity they had the tents struck again, and insisted on moving forward to pass the night at Sachabamba, intending next day either to come face to face with the enemy, or march into Guamanga.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971/56497.html","bookId":729,"book":{"id":729,"title":"The War of Chupas","description":"简介： Pedro de Cieza de Len was, on the whole, the most important historian, and is now the best authority, on ancient Peru, so far as his work has reached us; for he was a great traveller, and an eye-witness of much that he described....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM"}}
