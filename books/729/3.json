{"id":23631,"no":3,"title":"CHAPTER II","content":"How the General Lorenzo de Aldana determined to send an expedition to settle in Anzerma, a place discovered by the captain Belalcazar, and how he chose Jorge Robledo to be captain of this new settlement. \n \n THERE was such order in the government of the cities that, although Aldana had been but a short time in charge,[15] it seemed quite a different state of affairs from what had preceded it. Being in the city of Cali, Pedro de A?asco went as captain and lieutenant-governor at Timaná. Aldana charged him to treat the Indians fairly,[5] and not to allow the Spaniards shamelessly to rob, or seize their lands, and to punish any one so offending with the utmost rigour. He wrote to Juan de Ampudia at Popayán to the same effect. After he had attended to these affairs, seeing that there were still many men left in Cali, including veterans well versed in the service of conquest, he resolved to form a settlement in the provinces of Anzerma, which lie further west than the city of Cali, and border on the very rich and forceful river of Santa Marta. They had been discovered by the captain Sebastian de Belalcázar. And although Aldana understood that much profit might result from such an expedition to any captain who should undertake it, he cast avarice aside; for he cared more about the good government of the territory entrusted to him, and considered very carefully what captain he should send on this enterprise. Though, among those who came from Cartagena, were Melchor Suer de Nava, Alonso de Montemayor, the Comendador Hernán Rodríguez de Sosa, and other men of ability who might have performed the service, Aldana did not see fit to give it to any of these who had recently come from another government, and had not fought under any banner in Peru. Among those present in the city of Cali there were few who complied with that condition. He finally selected Jorge Robledo. Certainly he did not err, for Robledo was such a man as would serve the King well, and might well be employed on such a service. \n \n I have seen the power which Aldana received from the Marquis for making this appointment, and though some asserted that it was frivolous and without proper authority, they deceive themselves. It was approved in Spain; and in Panamá Dr. Villalobos, a Judge who was there at the time, told me that Aldana had a full right to appoint Robledo. The document of the Marquis states: \"That as he had been informed that there were some provinces discovered but yet to be settled, if Aldana were occupied in[6] the government and reformation of the cities, he might nominate such a person as should seem good to him, to go in his place to make a settlement, and that he himself gave requisite powers to the person so appointed.\" As Aldana held this commission he determined to send Jorge Robledo. First he made a repartimiento of the Indians subject to the city of Cali, among fewer citizens than were then at Cali. The rest, and those of us among the men who had come from Cartagena with Vadillo who most desired to go, enlisted with Robledo: all being well contented. Lorenzo de Aldana ordered that the new city that was to be founded, should be called the city of \"St. Anne of the Knights.\"[16] He appointed Melchor Suer de Nava and Martin de Amoroto as Alcaldes, and Ruy Vanegas as Alguacil Mayor. Having made these appointments, and given the captain Robledo his orders, he instructed them to leave Cali, taking as few native servants as possible, and he dismissed many of those they had engaged. He himself went with them as far as a village called Meacanoa, seven leagues from Cali, and then returned. The captain Jorge Robledo continued his journey, having started on the 8th of July 1549.[17] In this expedition I served. After he had arranged these matters, Aldana departed for the city of Popayán, leaving Miguel Mu?oz as Governor\u0027s lieutenant at Cali, and having given the citizens lists of the Indians they held in repartimiento. When he arrived at Popayán he did the same as at Cali, where, having left Juan de Ampudia as Governor\u0027s lieutenant, he set out for Quito. \n \n At this time Gonzalo Díaz de Pineda obtained a commission from the Marquis Pizarro to found a town in Pasto, but it was not to derogate from the powers of Aldana; only that if the latter were absent Pineda might act. When at Quito Pineda heard that Aldana was coming, he set out[7] with some Spaniards to found the town; but Aldana had already arrived at the valley of Guapuanquer where he then founded Villa Viciosa de Pasto, afterwards moved to the valley of Atris, where it now is. At the time of the founding an act was ordered to be recorded, which said that \"Lorenzo de Aldana desired to consider Gonzalo Díaz de Pineda as his colleague in that foundation.\" Although this is so, in my first book I did not mention any founder but Lorenzo de Aldana, for it is clear that he alone had the necessary power for the affair of those cities. As for saying so of Gonzalo Díaz enough has been written. \n \n When Aldana had founded Villa Viciosa de Pasto he left as Governor\u0027s lieutenant one Rodrigo de Ocampo, a man who well understood a war with Indians, and he divided the Chiefs and villages among the settlers who were to remain there. We have written all that relates to the foundation and site of that town and customs of the natives, in the Book of Foundations. After he had seen to the good order of this town, Aldana proceeded to the city of Quito, where he remained until Gonzalo Pizarro arrived; and at present we have nothing more to say about Aldana. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971/56416.html","bookId":729,"book":{"id":729,"title":"The War of Chupas","description":"简介： Pedro de Cieza de Len was, on the whole, the most important historian, and is now the best authority, on ancient Peru, so far as his work has reached us; for he was a great traveller, and an eye-witness of much that he described....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM"}}
