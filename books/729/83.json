{"id":23711,"no":83,"title":"CHAPTER LXXXII","content":"How Garcilaso de la Vega arrived in Cuzco; of the imprisonment of Don Diego, and how Vaca de Castro travelled to that city. \n \n AFTER the rout at the battle of Chupas, Don Diego de Almagro and Diego Méndez rode away together, with the intention of seeking refuge with the Inca Manco. They could have done this easily, if Diego Méndez had not caused delay by going to see a woman he kept as his mistress at Cuzco. To induce Don Diego to go to that city, he said that without fresh shoeing the horses could not take them anywhere, and that they must go to Cuzco to provide themselves with what they required, and that, after that, they could go to where the Inca was staying. Don Diego had to consent, although it was against his will, and they arrived in the city. Diego Méndez went off to the arms of his mistress, just as if he had come home victorious, but at that time the news of what had happened[293] had not reached Cuzco. Don Diego made haste to start; but, when at last they did, the result of the war was public knowledge. When Don Diego and Diego Méndez had got clear of Cuzco, they took the road to the valley of Yucay, intending to make their way thence into the mountains, in search of the Inca. Barragán, who had been left as Lieutenant at Cuzco, had by this time been made a prisoner; and when they heard that Don Diego was gone, Rodrigo Salazar, Juan Gutiérrez Malaver, and some others went in chase. After some exigencies he was captured, with Diego Méndez, in the valley of Yucay, brought back to Cuzco, and lodged in custody. \n \n Garcilaso de la Vega, and those who left Chupas with him, proceeded to Cuzco and at once took possession of the city in the name of the King, to keep order there until the Governor should arrive. Vaca de Castro left Guamanga as we have related, and travelled until he arrived at the ruined edifices of Vilcas. He remained there a few days to provide for the despatch of Pedro de Puelles as his Lieutenant to install settlers in the city of León. He selected those who were to go, gave them warrants for encomiendas, and ordered Pedro de Puelles to proceed on this duty. News arrived that Juan de Vargas, a veteran conquistador in those parts, had, after much trouble, cleverly captured Illa Tupac, one of the Inca\u0027s captains who had risen in rebellion and done much mischief. This was, indeed, a notable service that Juan de Vargas, who was a native of La Higuera, near Fregenal de la Sierra, performed; and the Governor approved of it. Having received his warrants, Pedro de Puelles set out from Vilcas with the Spaniards who had been told off to accompany him, and travelled until he reached the province of Huanuco, where, in the name of his Majesty, he founded the city of León. \n \n While the Governor Vaca de Castro was still at Vilcas, news came to him that one of young Almagro\u0027s captains[294] was near by. In a former chapter we made mention of all who were put to death, and among them was included this one, named Juan Pérez. The Governor ordered that he should be sought for by the Indians, and that when he was captured he should be quartered. After giving this order, Vaca de Castro left Vilcas, and proceeded to the province of Andahuaylas. There he received word that there was scope for founding a city near the Bracamoros and Pedro de Vergara\u0027s territory, and, as it was desirable to arrange about the disposal of the people, he appointed Juan Porcel to be captain there. So Porcel started off with the Spaniards of his following for the place we have said. Vaca de Castro continued his journey until he arrived at the buildings of Limatambo, whence he sent off despatches to his Majesty informing him of the victory God had granted him, of how the Realm had been brought back to the royal allegiance, that Don Diego was a prisoner, that sentence had been duly executed on his captains, and other matters relating to the administration. Before he left Limatambo, there came certain captains from the province of Chile, where the captain Pedro de Valdivia was in charge, requesting the aid of more Spaniards for the subjugation of those parts. After Vaca de Castro had taken note of what those captains had to report, he set out for the great city of Cuzco, where a solemn reception was accorded him, and he was welcomed by all the people with great joy. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971/56504.html","bookId":729,"book":{"id":729,"title":"The War of Chupas","description":"简介： Pedro de Cieza de Len was, on the whole, the most important historian, and is now the best authority, on ancient Peru, so far as his work has reached us; for he was a great traveller, and an eye-witness of much that he described....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM"}}
