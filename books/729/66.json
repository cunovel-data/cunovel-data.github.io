{"id":23694,"no":66,"title":"CHAPTER LXV","content":"Of the concern shown by Don Diego and many of the Chile party at the death of the captain Cristóbal de Sotelo; and of how García de Alvarado and others fortified themselves in his quarters, and Don Diego wanted to attack them there. THE news of the murder of Captain Cristóbal de Sotelo soon spread throughout the city, and great was the excitement, for he was beloved by many soldiers for his valour, by the veterans who had served under the old Adelantado, and by those others who had recently chosen to follow the banners of Don Diego. They were so affected that it did not fail to be evident from their sad countenances and from the tears that flowed from their eyes. With sorrowful lamentations they girded on their arms and repaired to the quarters of Don Diego, abandoning García de Alvarado, and calling him vile and cowardly for murdering Sotelo when he was disabled by sickness. They desired to have the traitor delivered into their hands that they might put him to death for daring to take the life of the captain they so greatly adored. Presently Juan Balsa went to young Don Diego\u0027s quarters and apprised him of what had happened, though he was out at the time. Don Diego was much concerned, because some told him that García de Alvarado wanted to deal with him in the same way, and revolt against him with the whole camp. Although Don Diego showed no weakness, but was anxious to go and seize or kill the murderer there and then, they advised him to enter the house of Pedro de O?ate, who was afterwards Camp Master, whence he ordered the alarm to be given through the city. He went to the great square, with those who rallied round him, whence it was his intention to go and attack the house[221] where García de Alvarado was ensconced. The captain Felipe Gutiérrez and other prudent cavaliers urged him not to do this, because it was not a time for expending men\u0027s lives, they said, and it might give rise to a mutiny against Don Diego himself, for it was known that some captains and many soldiers had a true friendship for García de Alvarado, and that if things came to blows, all their fury would be against Don Diego. He was thus persuaded not to attack the house in which García de Alvarado had shut himself up with the others who stood by him. Martín Carrillo, although he no longer enjoyed the post of Camp Master, but was only a private person, went out and about the city, without any authority whatever, forbidding everyone, on pain of death, to quit their houses. Don Diego, observing the luke-warmness and lack of will to carry out his wishes in those who were with him, returned very sadly to his house. When the quarrelsome García de Alvarado saw how prosperously, and favourably to his wishes, the affair of the murder of Sotelo had turned out, he sent some of his friends to induce as many as they could to side with him; and since the Spaniards in Peru are so changeable and fickle, and hold to no faith but their own private interests, seeing that García de Alvarado had more power than he whom they had chosen and appointed as their Governor, they joined him who seemed the stronger in greater numbers than he expected, offering their arms and their persons as far as he might wish to avail himself of them. Don Diego was now in his house, as we said, feeling very deeply the death of Cristóbal de Sotelo, and the fact that he was not strong enough to punish the author of so foul a deed. Taking counsel with his captains and principal persons as to what it would be best to do, they agreed that it was not expedient, nor was it a time to form themselves into cliques and parties, for the enemy was at their gates. So[222] a truce was arranged between Don Diego and García de Alvarado. Don Diego covertly sent to say that García de Alvarado had better stay in his house and not come out of it, because no other course was convenient. García de Alvarado was so haughty and presumptuous that he cared very little for any words or commands of Don Diego; but he answered, in bad faith, that he would do as he was ordered, and would not leave his house until it should be Don Diego\u0027s pleasure.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971/56487.html","bookId":729,"book":{"id":729,"title":"The War of Chupas","description":"简介： Pedro de Cieza de Len was, on the whole, the most important historian, and is now the best authority, on ancient Peru, so far as his work has reached us; for he was a great traveller, and an eye-witness of much that he described....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM"}}
