{"id":23680,"no":52,"title":"CHAPTER LI","content":"How Don Diego de Almagro, with his General García de Alvarado, went in pursuit of Pero Alvarez Holguin, and how, after getting near to Bombon, they turned back: also of the death of Juan de Herrada, and how Pero Alvarez continued his march. THE men of Chile having decided to go in pursuit of Pero Alvarez Holguin in the hope of defeating him, they set out, as related, from Jauja. Juan de Herrada was greatly weakened by his illness, and, being unable to go on with Don Diego, he stayed behind in that valley. But after leaving there and marching with great speed in expectation of overtaking their enemies, as explained before, they were unable, owing to the great difficulties of the road, to come up with the troops of Pero Alvarez, although they overtook his baggage and did some mischief to it. The general opinion now was that they would do well to go back to Jauja, and continue their march from thence direct to Guamanga and the great city of Cuzco. The object was to increase their army with the men they might find in those cities, make artillery, and wait to see how Vaca de Castro would enter the Realm, and whether he would join hands with the partisans of the Pizarros. And then, according to his policy, they would decide what they had best do. The enmity and hatred they felt against Gómez de Tordoya was very great, because they said he was the principal cause of Pero Alvarez having abandoned his expedition to the Chunchos and returned to Cuzco. They wanted to take revenge on him for that.[95] So when they resolved to give up the chase after Pero[175] Alvarez, they returned to Jauja, and there found that Juan de Herrada[96] had died of his infirmity; at which all were deeply sorrowful. Here they rested awhile and begged supplies of food from the Indians. Pero Alvarez Holguin continued his march at this point with great labour. The ground was very steep and rugged, the mountain passes were snow-covered and excessively cold, the rivers much swollen, and in many places without bridges. He heard how near the enemy had been, and kept his men in good order, animating them to show a bold front to those who were in pursuit. But all the captain\u0027s soldiers were so resolved to die in maintaining their cause that exhortations were hardly necessary. They were constantly on the alert, and never tired of keeping their arms by them, to see if those men of Chile would join issue with them. When those in the rear guard knew that the enemy had turned back, the march was continued in splendid order, with scouts always in advance to keep them in[176]formed. The Indians being so addicted to lying, and caring so little for speaking the truth, spread reports that parties were coming against them from in front, and that the men of Chile were still pressing forward in their rear. This caused some trouble and disquiet, for they received many false alarms. The ensigns went forward with the banners and the royal standard. The way, as we have said, was very difficult and the rivers swollen and many without bridges, so that, in the hurry of crossing, some Spaniards, horses, and Indians were drowned. They marched on until they came to an ancient fortress of the Incas, former kings of these regions. The name of it is Tambo, and it stands half way between Jauja and Caxamarca. The position where the fortress and its barracks stood, was a strong one, and Pero Alvarez resolved to rest there, both Spaniards and horses being much fatigued. While they were there the General, his captains, and head men consulted together as to what should be done, and it was agreed that messengers should be sent from thence to the licentiate Vaca de Castro, to let him know what had been done in the service of his Majesty, and that they were then in search of him, and to ask also for his commands as to what they should further do in the king\u0027s interests. They chose Luis de León as their messenger, a citizen of Arequipa; Juan Alonso Palomino and Diego de Torres were ordered to go to Guaraz and ascertain where the captain Alonso de Alvarado was, for they now knew from the men they had captured at Jauja, and from the Indians, that he had raised the banner in the service of the King and was awaiting, with a strong force of Spaniards, the arrival of Vaca de Castro. The messengers took letters from Pero Alvarez and his captains to persuade Alonso de Alvarado to come and join forces with them, the one wish and desire of all being to serve the king. And then they could move forward with all despatch,[177] that Vaca de Castro might know what had happened. The messengers, taking the letters and their credentials, eagerly set out to find Vaca de Castro. They passed through very great danger, for the natives, at a village called Taca, seeing them so few in number, came out to kill them. Scarcely had they got there with their despatches when the Indians attacked them with great boldness; but in the end, as they were valiant soldiers, they passed on and arrived at the camp of Alonso de Alvarado. When that captain heard that Pero Alvarez was coming with such a brilliant company, and whole-hearted readiness to serve the King, he rejoiced. But for them to suppose that he would place himself under the command of Pero Alvarez and be his subordinate, when he had formerly been his superior, he looked upon as folly, and determined that it should not be. Instead, he answered the messengers equivocally, and furthermore offered excuses in his letters, which appeared fair, in order that no discord should arise. As soon as Pero Alvarez Holguin had despatched the messengers, he departed from that fortress and took the same road they went by, always maintaining good order among his troops. The Indians came out to attack the rear-guard and see if they could plunder any part of the baggage. In this manner, and with very great labour owing to the rugged nature of the track, they arrived at a village named Guaraz in the province of Guaylas, where they found plenty of food. They then consulted about what should be done next, and decided upon waiting there for the reply of Vaca de Castro, to see whether he would come quickly to that part. For with the enemy in rear, nothing was to be gained in despoiling the country and consuming supplies, since they must perforce go back the way they came. And so with the approval of all, Pero Alvarez established his camp there, fixed the standard in the midst of the officers\u0027 quarters, and the banners in their order, leaving an[178] open space for any needs that might arise. Pero Alvarez ordered that there was to be no ill-treatment of the Indians, on pain of severe punishment, but that they were to be treated fairly and their food supplies taken only in moderation; but this order was of little avail. The flocks and other things that were robbed and taken from the Indians cannot lightly be told; yet there is no other way for it in such times.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971/56473.html","bookId":729,"book":{"id":729,"title":"The War of Chupas","description":"简介： Pedro de Cieza de Len was, on the whole, the most important historian, and is now the best authority, on ancient Peru, so far as his work has reached us; for he was a great traveller, and an eye-witness of much that he described....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM"}}
