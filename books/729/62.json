{"id":23690,"no":62,"title":"CHAPTER LXI","content":"How the captain Pero Alvarez Holguin felt somewhat aggrieved because the standard he had presented was not displayed, and there was even some commotion; and how Vaca de Castro again made public the decree of His Majesty that he held, and requested, by virtue of it, that he be acknowledged as Governor. \\n\\n \\n\\n AS soon as Vaca de Castro ordered the standard which Pero Alvarez presented to him to be taken over they all moved off towards the place where the camp was pitched, which was not far away, and, as there were many tents, it looked like a great town. When they were starting Pero Alvarez observed that the standard the Governor had brought with him was displayed, but not so the one he himself had presented. This hurt his feelings very deeply. Some of his friends saw it also, and began to make a disturbance, but not so as to reveal the cause of their annoyance. Pero Alvarez, prudently dissembling his feelings, rode side by side with Vaca de Castro, who had clearly discerned the other\u0027s pique. When they arrived at the[206] camp they found it all decorated with sedges and green boughs. Before entering the quarters which had been arranged for him, he ordered that all should remain where they were, without moving or going to rest, because he had something to say to them. When the Spaniards heard this, none of them went away: on the contrary, all the captains and other principal people wanted to hear why Vaca de Castro directed them to stay. A high stage was set up covered with a cloth of black velvet, and on it was placed a blue velvet chair. Then, without seating himself, he addressed them with a countenance and mien of great authority, and spoke thus: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Loyal Cavaliers, Renowned Captains, Subjects of Caesar our Emperor and great King:— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am not unaware, for I well know, of the great loyalty and generous valour which have moved you to serve his Majesty, and to undo the rebellious tyranny which has been set up by Don Diego and those who subserve his nefarious aims. Be assured that the value which his Majesty, and I in his royal name, will put upon such loyalty cannot be overrated. It has pleased God to at length bring me here, after having suffered many perils by the way and endured such illnesses and unrest as you all now know. I do not think lightly of telling you these things; but rather do I rejoice and feel it a great happiness, and congratulate myself that, with your favour, I may now perform whatsoever is fitting in the king\u0027s interest. My desire will be to reward and gratify each according to his service. That my coming might be known in this illustrious army, I sent forward a copy of his Majesty\u0027s decree commissioning me to govern these Realms to Captain Pero Alvarez, and to the other officers belonging to it; and now it is proper, having seen the original document, that you should receive and acknowledge me anew as Governor and Captain-General.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [207] \\n\\n \\n\\n When he had said this he took out the commission and ordered the secretary to read it aloud, and all, holding up their right hands, began to shout out: \"Long live the King!\" and that they took and held Vaca de Castro to be their Governor. He then turned to them and said that he had to apportion the land among them all. Having finished his speech, the Governor stepped down and went to his lodging, where the captains Alonso de Alvarado, Pero Alvarez Holguin, Garcilaso de la Vega, Lorenzo de Aldana, Diego de Rojas, Pedro Anzures, and Don Pedro Puertocarrero, with many other captains, remained with him. He observed to them that since there are citizens and councillors in all the cities of the Realm, those of each place should meet together and elect municipal officers, to acknowledge him as Governor, just as the army had recognized him as Captain-General: and this they presently did. Then Vaca de Castro retired to rest, and the captains and cavaliers did the same; where we will leave them for the present, in order to say a little about Don Diego de Almagro. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971/56483.html","bookId":729,"book":{"id":729,"title":"The War of Chupas","description":"简介： Pedro de Cieza de Len was, on the whole, the most important historian, and is now the best authority, on ancient Peru, so far as his work has reached us; for he was a great traveller, and an eye-witness of much that he described....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM"}}
