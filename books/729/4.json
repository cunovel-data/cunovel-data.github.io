{"id":23632,"no":4,"title":"CHAPTER III","content":"How his Majesty nominated Don Pascual de Andagoya to be Governor and Adelantado of the river of San Juan; and how Robledo proceeded to establish the town of Anzerma. \\n\\n \\n\\n THE Licentiate Caspar de Espinosa, he whom we mentioned, some way back,[18] as having died in the city of Cuzco, was a citizen of Panamá in Tierra Firme. He received great accounts of the valley of Baeza and the river of San Juan, so he sent to his Majesty to petition for the[8] government of that territory; but just when a grant of the government was sent to him he died. It was then granted to Don Pascual de Andagoya, with the condition that he was not to trench on any part that had been discovered or settled by the Marquis Pizarro, or any of his captains. After Andagoya\u0027s business was settled at Court he went to Seville and embarked, landing afterwards at Nombre de Dios, and going thence to Panamá. Although he there got news that the captain Belalcazar, with the title of the Marquis\u0027s Captain-General, had marked off and settled three or four cities, not on that account did he cease to covet, and soon he began to collect men and fit out ships for the voyage. Some people urged him to devote himself to the exploration and settlement of the territory that was granted to him and leave the rest, for to do otherwise would be an error. His Majesty would not deprive the Marquis of what was within his government. Taking little heed of this advice Andagoya pushed forward his preparations for departing from the city of Panamá.[19] \\n\\n \\n\\n Returning to the proceedings of Robledo. After leaving Meacanoa he made all possible haste to arrive at the region which was his destination. He made Ruy Vanegas his ensign, and, as in the valley below there flowed the great river of Santa Marta, the baggage was got across on a raft, and in a very large canoe. They marched on until they came to a village which was named Pescado, situated on the banks of that river. Nothing had happened worthy of record, except that a Portuguese named Roque Martín killed a negress he cohabited with, by stabbing her. He fled from justice to Timaná, but was killed by the Indians and eaten. It was a judgment of God, which was clearly seen in[9] this punishment, for this Roque Martín, without fear of God, had fed his dogs upon Indians\u0027 limbs, which dogs were used by him to hunt down native men and women. At last, albeit his delight was to kill so many Indians, yet his end was to die at their hands, and to find a tomb in their bellies. \\n\\n \\n\\n From this village Robledo continued his march. His followers numbered a hundred Spaniards, horse and foot. He went on until he came to the borders of the province. The natives, having had notice of the approach of the invaders, had hidden their supplies, and had concealed themselves in ravines, and in the most secret places of their land. The captain, after having sent up the baggage from the river to the heights where they were, and having got all the Spaniards together, ordered the swiftest among them to make ready, and then sent them out to search for the natives. Although the latter were well concealed the runners took more than 200 persons. The captain spoke very kindly to them, through the interpreters he had brought with him. These were three Indian women named Barbola, Antona, and Catalina. As the captain knew that I was curious to learn the secrets of the Indians he gave Catalina to me, that I might more easily acquire the knowledge I sought. He told the Indians that they should render obedience to the King and be friends with the Christians, and that it was desirable there should be conferences on the subject. In order that they might understand that faith would be kept with them, he ordered them all to be set free, telling them to ask their Chiefs to come and confer with him. \\n\\n \\n\\n When the people throughout the province understood that the Spaniards had set their prisoners free, and that they had come to form a new settlement, several Chiefs and principal men came and were well received by the captain, who began to treat with them, hoping that it would please God to bring all the natives of the province to an attitude[10] of peace. From these Indians it was ascertained that Spaniards like themselves were coming from the Ocean Sea, that they had many horses, and were capturing and killing the Indians. Robledo, on hearing this, consulted with his principal officers, and it was decided to seek out a site and found a city; for, peradventure, it might not be people of Cartagena who were coming, and it would be well to anticipate them, and be first to form a settlement. So the captain Ruy Vanegas, with twenty Spaniards, horse and foot, set out to find a site, followed by Robledo and the rest. Before we go on any farther, it will be well to relate what people those were who were coming. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971/56417.html","bookId":729,"book":{"id":729,"title":"The War of Chupas","description":"简介： Pedro de Cieza de Len was, on the whole, the most important historian, and is now the best authority, on ancient Peru, so far as his work has reached us; for he was a great traveller, and an eye-witness of much that he described....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM"}}
