{"id":23667,"no":39,"title":"CHAPTER XXXVIII","content":"How Gómez de Tordoya and other citizens of Cuzco agreed to send messengers to the captain Pero Alvarez Holguin that, on knowing of the death of the Marquis, he should raise the banner for the King. \\n\\n \\n\\n I AM weary of trying to comprehend the events which happened in the Realm at this time, because it was proper to narrate what passed in Lima, and the steps taken by Vaca de Castro. God is my witness to the vigils I have kept and the little ease I have enjoyed. I only want one reward, and that is that the reader will look upon me as a friend, and bear in mind the many journeys I have made to investigate the notable events in these Realms. And as the labour of composing these writings is so great, I am already tired and sincerely wish to get to the end of it. But there! we must return to our story. Pero Alvarez Holguin had come with a commission from the Marquis to invade the country of the Chunchos from which Pero[131] Anzures had returned unsuccessful. Some say that, before he started from Lima, he had spoken to the men of Chile and advised them to kill the Marquis and avenge the death of Don Diego de Almagro the elder, and that, when he arrived at Cuzco, several people heard him say that the Marquis was going to be killed. This is not known for certain, being merely what was rumoured. I do not believe that Holguin stated anything like that. But they say that he did not seem to go off very well pleased with the Marquis. \\n\\n \\n\\n Gómez de Tordoya, Gonzalo de los Nidos, Villacastin, and the other citizens and knights who had gathered together, considered what they should do that the result might turn out prosperous, and that his Majesty might be duly served. The licentiate de La Gama and Captain Castro, with others who had started with Pero Alvarez Holguin, said that as he had not yet entered the region he was making for, they determined, as good and loyal vassals and servants of his Majesty, to take a very decisive step. This was to write to Pero Alvarez that, as the Marquis was dead, and the murderers had got possession of the Realm and held it, he, being so good a servant of the king, should abandon the enterprise he had undertaken and join them with the men he had with him; and that they would recognize him as Captain-General, and raise the banner of his Majesty. He could then prevent the Chile party from doing any harm, and march to join the licentiate Vaca de Castro who, as they all knew, was coming as Judge of residencia. They urged Pero Alvarez not to refuse what they now proposed, because fortune appeared favourable, and in addition to honour and everlasting fame, he would acquire a great reward in the Realm. They added that he should know the city of Cuzco favoured Don Diego, and that Gabriel de Rojas was there as his Lieutenant. \\n\\n \\n\\n [132] \\n\\n \\n\\n Having written this, and while they were all in a village of the Collao called Ayavire, Martín de Almendras arrived there, on his way from the town of La Plata. They agreed to send him to Pero Alvarez with the news, and Almendras promised to go with all diligence. He started in a litter, accompanied by many Indians, and travelled so fast that in one day and one night he covered 37 leagues. For Indians came in relays from all parts to carry the litter or hammock in which he made the journey. Travelling at this speed Almendras arrived at a village called Chuquito where he found some soldiers of Pero Alvarez, left there to await news of whether the Marquis had dismissed him from the command or made any other provision to his detriment. His suspicion must have arisen from having had some conversations with the men of Chile at Lima, and he thought that if this came to the ears of the Marquis he would deprive him of his command. Those who were thus left were a knight, native of Cáceres, named Sancho Perero, a veteran in these Realms who had served his Majesty, and Hernando de Rivera, with two or three others. When Almendras arrived where they were, they asked him what was the news, and why he came in such a hurry. He answered very sadly that they would soon know, and then went to rest, to be ready to start again. Sancho Perero, and the others when they heard those words that \"they would soon know what was coming,\" believed that the Marquis was sending a new order to Pero Alvarez countermanding the enterprise. So they determined to seize the despatch or letters that Almendras was carrying. They went straight to where he was, held a dagger at his breast, and said that if he did not give up the letters they would kill him. Seeing himself in this difficulty, Almendras said that there was no reason in what they were doing, for that they might know that what he came for was to advise Captain Pero Alvarez of the death[133] of the Marquis. Having said this he related to them all that was happening, and how he had been slain by the men of Chile; and they were very deeply affected. \\n\\n \\n\\n Sancho Perero told Almendras to stay there, as he must be tired by his journey, and that he would go to Pero Alvarez with the news. Martín de Almendras replied that he was content with that arrangement; but presently he started in his hammock and travelled until he came to the province of Chuqui_apu, where he caught up the captain Pero Alvarez. When that officer heard the news he was moved by it, but gladly accepted the appointment that was offered him, and declared that he would either avenge the murder of the Marquis or die in the attempt. Gómez de Tordoya came along with those who were flocking to where Pero Alvarez was, and when he arrived at Chuquito he had got together twenty-five Spaniards. There it was agreed amongst them to send another messenger to Pero Alvarez, and that Captain Castro should be the man; for celerity, in times like these, was a great help towards a prosperous ending. So Castro went off at once and proceeded until he met Pero Alvarez, who at the first news had raised the banner of the King against the tyranny of Almagro. He entrusted the banner to Martín de Robles, and went on in advance with such as were mounted to form a junction with Gómez de Tordoya and the others who were at Chuquito. They all showed great joy at the meeting. Don Pedro Puertocarrero and Pedro de los Ríos had left Cuzco with the idea of reaching the town of La Plata, and there joining Pero Anzures. But when they heard of the assembling of troops in the Collao they repaired thither and joined Pero Alvarez and the citizens of Cuzco. It was then decided to return to that city, and have Pero Alvarez declared Captain-General in the name of his Majesty, to punish the tyranny of the men of Chile and their usurpation of the Realm. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971/56452.html","bookId":729,"book":{"id":729,"title":"The War of Chupas","description":"简介： Pedro de Cieza de Len was, on the whole, the most important historian, and is now the best authority, on ancient Peru, so far as his work has reached us; for he was a great traveller, and an eye-witness of much that he described....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM"}}
