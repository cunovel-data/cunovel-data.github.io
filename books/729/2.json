{"id":23630,"no":2,"title":"CHAPTER I","content":"How the Marquis Don Francisco Pizarro went to the province of Arequipa, to found a city there, and divided the natives among the persons who would remain there as citizens. \n \n THE Governor, Don Francisco Pizarro, determined to go and found the city of Arequipa. The affairs of the town of Plata were in good order, the captain Pero Anzures having made arrangements for the maintenance of the settlers, and for the orderly service of the Indians. Having visited the province of Collao the Governor set out with the Spaniards who were in attendance on him. He travelled so well that he arrived at the district where the city was to be founded. Then messengers arrived with news that the Inca Manco wished to make peace. This was not true. The captain Gonzalo Pizarro having departed from Cuzco in search of the Inca, some events happened between them. Gonzalo occupied a rocky eminence, destroyed two bridges, and pursued the Inca so closely that he was on the point of falling into his hands. The Inca was so pressed that he sent messengers to the Governor. Don Francisco[2] Pizarro was anxious to bring the Inca into obedience to his Majesty, so he determined to return to Cuzco to secure that end. While he was on the journey from Chuqui_apu[12] to Arequipa, he reflected that the affairs of Quito were very important, that three or four cities were already founded there, while there were reports of provinces where as many more might be founded. So he resolved to send Gonzalo Pizarro there in accordance with a commission from his Majesty authorizing him to send one of his brothers as Governor of those parts if he should think it desirable. Having come to this decision the Marquis wrote to his brother with orders presently to set out for Quito. Gonzalo Pizarro, on receiving the command of the Marquis, set out for Quito with some followers, by the royal road. He intended to penetrate into the land of cinnamon, where great riches were reported. \n \n As the Marquis had resolved to return to Cuzco, he directed the batchelor Garci Díaz Arias, who is now Bishop of Quito, to look out for the best site on which to found a city. He then, with a small company, set out for the valley of Yucay, when he sent messengers to the King Manco Inca Yupanqui, proposing that he should come and treat with him, as he was waiting for him in that valley. \n \n Manco Inca received the news, and showed a desire for peace on his part. He, likewise, sent messengers to the Marquis that he should make peace and depart. The Marquis, believing in what the barbarian had no intention of doing, tried to increase his good will by sending him a very handsome pillow[13] and clothes of silk. When the Inca heard of this, he came out on the road, and in place of rewarding the two messengers, he killed them both and returned to Viticos. They were two Christian servants of the Marquis.[3] The Inca placed no value on the friendship of the Spaniards nor on their promise. When the Marquis was informed of this, he was enraged to find that the barbarian would yield no obedience to the King, and that he was in such a position that submission could not be enforced. For this an expedition against the Inca was not then undertaken. \n \n In this valley of Yucay the Marquis put the principal wife of the Inca to death. This was looked upon as a great cruelty. The Marquis had taken her prisoner, and some even say that he, or else Gonzalo Pizarro, had had more than friendship with her. They even say the same of Antonio Picado, the secretary. As the Inca would not make peace, the greatest insult that could be put upon him would be to kill the wife he loved most. So she was put to a cruel death. She was terrified and asked why they were going to kill her, when she had done nothing deserving of death. Finding herself in this extremity she distributed all her jewels among the principal women who were with her, without keeping any at all. Then she begged of them that, when she should be dead, they would put her remains in a basket and let it float down the Yucay river, that the current might take it to her husband the Inca. When he learnt this, great was his sorrow. This done, the Marquis returned to Cuzco. \n \n Soon afterwards the news came that the batchelor Garci Díaz Arias and those who had remained with him had gone down towards the sea coast, seeking for a site on which to found the new city; but every place was difficult and with many defects. All came to the conclusion that Arequipa was the best place, and so they wrote to the Marquis. He approved; and he made a distribution, indicating those who were to become citizens, also naming the magistrates and municipal officers. He gave the appointment of Lieutenant Governor to Garci Manuel de Caravajal, a native of Truxillo. After the Marquis had made this distribution,[4] provisionally until the general distribution could be made at Lima in concert with the Bishop, he sent orders to Pedro Anzures at Plata, to take great care about the conversion of the Indians, and to explore the mines which were reported to exist near that town. He then set out for the city of San Juan de la Vitoria,[14] where the inhabitants welcomed his arrival with much content, and he stayed with them for some days. After he had made arrangements conducive to good government there, he proceeded to Lima, where the citizens came out to receive him, and he was very honourably welcomed by all. \n \n At this time fresh despatches arrived for the Marquis from his Majesty and from several Grandees of Spain. Their date was previous to the arrival of news of the death of the Adelantado. Among them there was a commission, with the seal, in which his Majesty, being informed of the holy life of Garcí Díaz Arias, appointed him Bishop-elect of Quito. All were rejoiced, for he was much beloved, and they made great festivities in the city in his honour. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971/56415.html","bookId":729,"book":{"id":729,"title":"The War of Chupas","description":"简介： Pedro de Cieza de Len was, on the whole, the most important historian, and is now the best authority, on ancient Peru, so far as his work has reached us; for he was a great traveller, and an eye-witness of much that he described....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM"}}
