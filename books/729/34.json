{"id":23662,"no":34,"title":"CHAPTER XXXIII","content":"Of the things that were done by the Chile party, and how they accepted Don Diego as Governor, also of the arrest of Antonio Picado, and how the Licentiate Rodrigo Ni?o and Orihuela came from Spain. \n \n HAVING imprisoned the principal citizens of Lima, got possession of the city, and seized all the arms and horses, the party resolved that Don Diego should be recognized as Governor. The news of the death of the Marquis was soon spread over all the districts, and reached the ears of the Indians. When it became generally known it was deeply mourned. The Indians said that the Christians had been very cruel to kill their captain, and that his death would give rise to grave evils. Never again would there be any one to shelter and protect them like him who was the first to discover and conquer them. They say that the battle of Chupas and its result was then foretold by the Indians. \n \n It appeared to Juan de Herrada and his friends that it was a certain thing that the municipality must receive Don Diego[75] as its Governor; in order that justice might[115] be maintained in the Realm until the rightful vengeance he had taken for the death of his father should be known to his Majesty, when the government would be granted to him. Fearing that the prisoners were not secure in the church, more guards were placed over them. The conspirators ordered the magistrates and municipal officers to assemble and elect Don Diego as Governor. The authorities, when they knew the intention of Don Diego and Juan de Herrada, considered that, although it was a great fault, still the lesser evil would be to accept the lad as Governor. It is said that among themselves they resented the force that was put upon them, and that Rodrigo de Mazuelos spoke very openly, at a meeting, against Don Diego. They proposed, however, to accept him in association with the treasurer Alonso de Riquelme. While the men of Chile were thinking that over, Antonio de Garay said that he did not hold that Don Diego was so ignorant as to need another to help him in governing. Finally Don Diego was accepted as Governor, and they took the wands from the ordinary magistrates, and gave them to Peces and Martín Carrillo. Cristóbal de Sotelo was made Lieutenant Governor; but Juan de Herrada was the man who governed Don Diego, and directed him in what he had to do. \n \n Up to this time the secretary Antonio Picado had not been captured; but now the conspirators went to the house of the treasurer Alonso de Riquelme, where they already knew he was. Searching the house, it is said that the treasurer told them, when they asked him where the[116] secretary was, that he did not know and had not seen him. At the same time he cast his glance in a certain direction, telling them by that sign that they would find him under the bed; where they took him. As he might know where the treasure of the Marquis was, and the documents, they agreed to treat him well, so that, thinking they were not going to kill him, he would divulge. They took him to the house of Don Diego, who was now called Governor. \n \n At this time a gentleman named the licentiate Rodrigo Ni?o, a native of Toledo, arrived from Spain. He and one Francisco de Orihuela came to find the Marquis, Orihuela bringing despatches and the licentiate to be an advocate in the residencia. Just then, too, a trumpeter who had been in the service of the Marquis was killed. They also arrested Hurtado, whom they found in the house of the Bishop Don Garcí Díaz. They gave the officials, to be inventoried, certain gold and jewels found in a closet of the Marquis\u0027s house. A man left Lima and went to inform Alonso de Cabrera, Chamberlain of the Marquis, of what had occurred. Don Diego ordered all the papers and documents of the Marquis to be collected. Among other things they found a will he had made before he died. Among the papers there were letters from the Comendador Mayor, Don Francisco de los Cobos, and from Dr. Beltrán, and the Cardinal, and other Grandees of Spain favourable to the Marquis. \n \n It seemed well that news of the death of the Marquis should be sent to Cuzco, to Gabriel de Rojas and other friends of Don Diego\u0027s father, that they might be aware of it, and it is said that an appointment as Lieutenant was sent to Gabriel de Rojas. There was a very diligent man in Lima named Juan Diente, who was ordered to go to Cuzco with the news. He went all that way on foot in five days, a thing that seems almost incredible. But many witnesses are yet alive who know to be true what I here[117] affirm, that Juan Diente travelled the 120 leagues from Lima to Cuzco in five days,[76] over a road so rough and wearisome, and in parts snow-covered as we have described elsewhere. Some say, however, that Indians carried him on their shoulders over the greater part in a hammock. \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971/56447.html","bookId":729,"book":{"id":729,"title":"The War of Chupas","description":"简介： Pedro de Cieza de Len was, on the whole, the most important historian, and is now the best authority, on ancient Peru, so far as his work has reached us; for he was a great traveller, and an eye-witness of much that he described....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM"}}
