{"id":23653,"no":25,"title":"CHAPTER XXIV","content":"How the alcalde Diego Nú?ez de Mercado arrived in Spain with news of the death of Almagro; how his Majesty deemed that event to be an ill service, and how he appointed the licentiate Cristóbal Vaca de Castro as Judge. \\n\\n \\n\\n THE alcalde Diego Nú?ez de Mercado, ever the faithful adherent of the Adelantado Don Diego de Almagro, left Peru as quickly as possible after his friend was beheaded, and embarked in a ship for Tierra Firme. Thence he travelled and sailed until he reached the Court of his Majesty with the news of the battle of Las Salinas and the death of Almagro, and all the other events that had happened in Peru. His knowledge was complete, for he was a third party in all the negotiations and agreements between the two Governors. When the Emperor heard of[80] the death of Almagro he was much grieved, and held that what had taken place in Peru was detrimental to his service. His Majesty was angry that such a loyal servant and vassal should have been put to death with such cruelty, and ordered the members of his Council to see justice done in the case. Soon afterwards Diego de Alvarado, and also Diego Gutiérrez de los Rios, arrived in Spain. They too related the execution of Almagro, and prayed for justice. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then Don Alonso Enríquez arrived in Spain with others, who told the story differently; so that the Council of the Indies, in order to get at the truth, nominated the licentiate Cristóbal Vaca de Castro as Judge of Commission, to go out and collect evidence. Some say that Hernando Pizarro obtained this appointment, through the Cardinal Loaysa, that he might have charge of the affairs of the Marquis Pizarro, because he would show himself favourable in that interest. However that may have been, this licentiate was ordered to proceed to Peru to investigate what we have said, and if perchance the Marquis Don Francisco Pizarro should die before the Judge\u0027s arrival or while he was there, he was to assume the government in the place of the said Marquis. And as some complaints against Dr. Robles, a judge of the Panamá Audience, had reached Spain, it was ordered that the Judge Vaca de Castro should be President of the Panamá Audience so long as he was there, and take steps to call Judge Robles and Dr. Villalobos to account. On leaving that Audience in good order, he was to set out for Peru. Having arrived there, he was to take evidence and make a thorough inquiry into the course of recent events there, and send home a report. \\n\\n \\n\\n Vaca de Castro accepted the appointment, and had great hopes that, with diligence, he would be able to perform the duties and do good service to his Majesty. As soon as the[81] appointment of Vaca de Castro was announced in Spain, Diego de Alvarado and others wrote to Diego de Almagro and Juan de Herrada, saying that Dr. Beltrán and other members of the Council had received large presents from the Marquis, whence it must be inferred that Vaca de Castro would not do strict justice there. These letters caused some perturbation in the minds of the men of Chile. Vaca de Castro, as soon as he had received his sailing orders, took leave of the Court and proceeded to San Lucar, where he embarked, with the title of President of the Audience of Panamá. Correspondents were not wanting who informed the Marquis of the appointment of Vaca de Castro, and of the very limited powers he brought with him, telling Pizarro that he need have no mistrust, as the Judge was going out rather to show him a favour, and that he would suffer no dishonour in consequence. \\n\\n \\n\\n Vaca de Castro sailed across the ocean until he came to Nombre de Dios, whence he proceeded to Panamá, arriving in the middle of January, 1542. It was given out that he came with wide powers and commissions. Arrived at Panamá, he was received as President in the Audience and Royal Chancellery. In the Audience Dr. Robles and Dr. Villalobos were judges. As soon as Vaca de Castro had been received by them as President, he produced a royal commission by which his Majesty ordered him to investigate the judges\u0027 proceedings, especially those of Dr. Francisco Robles, who had held office for a long time, and respecting whose acts several complaints had reached Spain. Presently this officer was suspended from duty, and his case was investigated. As Vaca de Castro was anxious to get on to Peru, he handed over the completion of the case to Dr. Villalobos, against whom there was nothing, and to the licentiate Páez de Laserna, who had lately arrived from Spain as a judge. He then arranged for his own departure, and quitted the harbour of Panamá in a galleon belonging[82] to Dr. Sepúlveda. There went with him Don Pedro Luis Cabrera, and Hernán Mejía, an alderman of the city of Seville. There were also with him Juan de Cáceres, Accountant of Peru, and Sebastián de Merlo, who had been the secretary of that Audience. He sailed for Peru, accompanied by several other ships, on the 18th of March in the year 1542. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971/56438.html","bookId":729,"book":{"id":729,"title":"The War of Chupas","description":"简介： Pedro de Cieza de Len was, on the whole, the most important historian, and is now the best authority, on ancient Peru, so far as his work has reached us; for he was a great traveller, and an eye-witness of much that he described....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM"}}
