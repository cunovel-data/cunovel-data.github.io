{"id":23639,"no":11,"title":"CHAPTER X","content":"How the captain Robledo discovered the province of Paucura, how the ensign Suer de Nava returned to Pozo, and how he perpetrated other cruelties worse than the former ones, and how Robledo left Paucura to explore the great and very rich province of Arma. WHAT I have related in the last chapter having taken place, and the captain having recovered from his wounds, we departed for the province of Paucura, where the principal Chief was one named Pimaná, who was also an enemy of the people of Pozo, but allied by lineage, speech, and customs to those of Picara, a populous and very fertile province. As they had heard what the Christians had done in Pozo, and were friends of Pimaná\u0027s relations in Picara, they agreed to submit peaceably and to bring in plenty of provisions, and so it was done. We arrived at Paucura in the afternoon of a Wednesday, and they showed much joy at our coming. So we lodged there as friends. When all our force had arrived, a soldier named Miranda said that certain pigs, which had gone amissing from the men who were bringing them, had been stolen by the Indians of Pozo. It was no great crime, nor ought it to have been punished with the cruelty which we must now describe. When Robledo was told of the loss of the pigs he was very angry, saying that the Pozo Indians had not kept the peace to which they had agreed, and that he would punish them for being false friends. He then[28] ordered his ensign to go with fifty Spaniards, horse and foot, to Pozo and punish the theft of the pigs. When the people of Paucura heard of the return of the Spaniards to Pozo they rejoiced at the good opportunity of doing all the injury they could to the people of Pozo, who were their enemies, so when Suer de Nava left the camp he was joined by over 3,000 Paucura?os. All united marched rapidly and, arriving in Pozo, they began to do great harm to the unfortunate people, burning their houses, ruining their villages, and robbing what they contained. That the sin might be greater, more than two hundred souls were murdered by the Paucura?os, who cut the bodies in pieces as if they had been saddles of mutton or legs of beef, and carried them off to their homes. It was surely a strange thing to see rational beings so very fond of human flesh, so that to obtain it there was no peace between fathers and their sons and brothers. As soon as Suer de Nava had recovered the pigs, and settled some terms of peace with the Pozo people, he returned to the province of Paucura where the captain had remained. Robledo had received tidings that at no great distance to the westward [sic] was situated the great and very rich province of Arma, which is the largest and most populous in all Peru, and where, if the natives could be domesticated, such a supply of gold might be obtained that the Spaniards settling there would become the richest in all those parts. Desirous of exploring these regions in order to form a new settlement, Robledo made his preparations and left Paucura accompanied by some of the Chiefs and many Indians; and we went on until we reached the crests of some mountains. By this time the arrival of the Spaniards was known in all the villages of that great province. Our deeds were exaggerated. It was said that with one blow of a sword we could cut open an Indian, and with one thrust of a lance we could run him through, but what terrified them most was[29] to hear the way a bolt was shot from a cross-bow, and the furious velocity with which it flew; while they also wondered at the speed of the horses. Finally they had debated among themselves as to whether they should keep the peace with us or come out to make war on us, and they had consulted their devils in regard to this. One may believe that the reply and counsel savoured of the oracle who gave them, and all watched for the part where the Spaniards would approach, to decide on what they would do. We set out from where, as I have said, we passed the previous night, and marched to the borders of the province. When we came in sight of a summit we heard a great noise, many drums beating and horns being blown. It was so in truth, for when the natives saw us coming that way they concealed their property and their women and children, and of one accord came out in warlike array to face us. When the captain heard the noise, he ordered all his men to form in order with their arms, and march to the summit. This was done. The shouts of the natives increased, while we advanced in leisurely fashion towards them. And although they tried to dismay us with their clamour, and by means of huge stones sent rolling down the hill, it availed them nought, because the daring of the Spaniards is so great that nothing in the world can daunt them; and so, in spite of all, they reached the summit and put the Indians to flight.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971/56424.html","bookId":729,"book":{"id":729,"title":"The War of Chupas","description":"简介： Pedro de Cieza de Len was, on the whole, the most important historian, and is now the best authority, on ancient Peru, so far as his work has reached us; for he was a great traveller, and an eye-witness of much that he described....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM"}}
