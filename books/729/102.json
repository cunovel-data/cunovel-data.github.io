{"id":23730,"no":102,"title":"CHAPTER CI","content":"Of what further took place between the captains, Felipe Gutiérrez and Francisco de Mendoza, and how, after having explored some provinces down the river, Felipe Gutiérrez was arrested by Francisco de Mendoza. THE reader will remember how, in previous chapters, we said that the general Felipe Gutiérrez went exploring down the Soconcho river, taking Francisco de Mendoza with him. Having formed his camp among people there, well supplied with provisions, Felipe Gutiérrez turned his attention to his plan of depriving Mendoza of the command he held. He sent to ask him for his papers, representing that he did so of a purpose, and because he wished him well, in order that the soldiers should not influence him to any step that might give rise to a renewal of mischief in the camp which would cause them all to be lost, for in no way was it possible for two leaders to govern the same force. Francisco de Mendoza was in no mind to resign the post that had been given to him, and replied to Felipe Gutiérrez that he would not consider any such proposal, because he would rather lose his life than his command. After this exchange of views the friends of Francisco de Mendoza warned him to look out for himself, because Felipe Gutiérrez wanted to kill him. He was astonished to hear such things and always kept men in his tent to help him if they should see him in any pass. The general Felipe Gutiérrez moved from there to another large province; and, leaving Sotomayor on guard over the camp, set out in quest of discoveries, taking Francisco de Mendoza with him and such men as he thought fit. He followed the river towards the west,[168] and they found the land flat and covered with trees[364] and explored it for fifty leagues, where he came to a well-peopled country. They had great battles with the barbarians in which, although a few Christians and horses were wounded, many of the natives were left dead upon the field. After having advanced the distance stated, they found no more inhabitants, and Felipe Gutiérrez wanted to go in search of some, either in one direction or another. The soldiers murmured against him, saying that if they had gone to explore in the direction of sunrise they would have found rich settlements where all might gain advantage, and that he had neither the sagacity nor the prudence requisite for undertaking this conquest. Francisco de Mendoza, glad to hear these things, cunningly began to give out that it was not Felipe Gutiérrez who was to blame, but the soldiers themselves for having him as their general, since he had not the ability to command them. In fine he said such things that he moved their minds to do a very disgraceful deed, and one deserving of severe punishment, for, revealing himself as the author of the stroke, this infatuated youth Francisco de Mendoza, accompanied by those who were his accomplices, went to the tent of his courageous though careless leader Felipe Gutiérrez and, raising the flap of his tent, shouted at him: \"Why, Felipe Gutiérrez, do you wish to kill me?\" Aroused from a deep sleep by the loud voice, Felipe Gutiérrez said, \"I kill you, Se?or Captain Francisco de Mendoza? I have never thought of such a thing.\" Without more words they all rushed in upon him, seized him, and put him in chains, robbing him of all he possessed, which was no small quantity. Not content with his capture they cried out that he should be killed. Francisco de Mendoza answered that there was no cause to kill him, and that it would be enough to turn him out of the country. Felipe Gutiérrez, finding himself thus treated, and seeing the disgraceful conduct of the people, fearing they would kill him, begged Francisco[365] de Mendoza to spare his life, and this he promised to do. From thence Francisco de Mendoza turned back towards the place where Sotomayor had remained with the camp, carrying Felipe de Gutiérrez, and four others who were suspected, as prisoners. These were Diego Alvarez, Juan Gutiérrez Valderrama and another. When they were near the camp, Mendoza left Ruy Sánchez de Hinojosa in charge of the prisoners, and went to the camp himself at night. On entering it he gave orders that no person was to go outside of his house on pain of death, and then Francisco de Mendoza managed his affair with such adroitness, that he got all the people over to his side. In the morning Mass was said, and when it was finished all took the oath to him as Lieutenant for the Governor, just as Felipe Gutiérrez had ordered when Diego de Rojas died. He then ordered Hinojosa to come in with the prisoners, and a close watch was kept over them.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971/56523.html","bookId":729,"book":{"id":729,"title":"The War of Chupas","description":"简介： Pedro de Cieza de Len was, on the whole, the most important historian, and is now the best authority, on ancient Peru, so far as his work has reached us; for he was a great traveller, and an eye-witness of much that he described....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM"}}
