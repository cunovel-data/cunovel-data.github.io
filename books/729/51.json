{"id":23679,"no":51,"title":"CHAPTER L","content":"How the General Pero Alvarez Holguin, after he had been accepted and sworn as General near Parcos, continued his march in the direction of Jauja; and how Gaspar Rodríguez de Camporedondo, while reconnoitring the country, captured the men who were in that province on behalf of Don Diego. \n \n IN the preceding chapters we mentioned how Captain Pero Alvarez Holguin, after he had been sworn in as Captain General, moved from the place where he was, with the intention of approaching the province of Jauja to obtain fuller knowledge of the proceedings of the men of Chile. Those twelve men sent by Don Diego from Lima, had arrived at Jauja to attend to the things we have said they were sent to do. They endeavoured to cement their friendship with the Guancas. But those Indians are very knowing, and were already aware of the arrival of Vaca de Castro, and of how Alonso de Alvarado had declared in Chachapoyas, and Pero Alvarez in Cuzco against the insurgents. So they concluded that it would be prudent to keep in with the Pachacama party. They were asked whether they had received word or knew anything of whether the Christians of Cuzco were coming. They replied that they knew nothing. And though they were well aware that Pero Alvarez was near their valley, they would not tell. Indeed certain Indians went to Pero Alvarez to report the state of affairs, and on this knowledge he sent Gaspar Rodríguez de Camporedondo to Jauja, to reconnoitre and see if any agents of Don Diego were there; and if so to arrest them. Gaspar Rodríguez, keen to serve the King, set out for Jauja, and surprised the Spaniards there at night and made them prisoners. He returned with them to Pero Alvarez, who ordered two to be hanged. He then[171] took counsel with his officers, and they resolved to deceive the enemy by telling the truth. It was in this way. As they would pass a place quite near the city of Lima, it would be natural to believe that they intended to march in and occupy the city and take possession of it. But if they should give out that they were going on by the mountain road, they would not be believed; and the enemy would come out the more readily to seek them. And thus they would be able to edge off on the road to Caxamarca without danger. So Pero Alvarez released the aforesaid Chile men, and told them to say to Don Diego and his followers that they ought to content themselves with the wrong they had already done, and not lay themselves out to commit more misdeeds; for punishment would surely overtake them. He was marching to Caxamarca because he did not wish to contend with them or give battle—not from any fear of them, but to see whether, having fallen into the error they had, they would turn to seek pardon from the King. Then, as I said, he sent them away and, entering the province of Jauja, he spoke to the Guancas, admonishing them that they should be his loyal friends, and not those of the men of Chile, who were going about opposing the King\u0027s interest. After saying some other things to them Pero Alvarez presently departed from Jauja. \n \n Well, let us return to Don Diego and his people, who were marching towards Jauja in good order, for they had now received news that their agents had been made prisoners. They wanted to learn the facts from one who met them and, thinking that he spoke with some reserve, Cristóbal de Sotelo put him to the torture. He then admitted that Pero Alvarez was coming with three hundred Spaniards, that he was bringing with him Don Alonso de Montemayor and Vasco de Guevara,[94] and that they were[172] on the road near to Bombon. Juan de Herrada was ill; but from a soldier named Zamarrilla, a swift goer who was wont to make his journeys in the dress of an Indian so as not to be known, he got word that Pero Alvarez was certainly marching straight to Bombon and that, being desirous to avoid a battle, he had ordered Zamarrilla, on pain of severe punishment, to say nothing to Don Diego or to the captains. When the others whom Pero Alvarez had sent arrived and confirmed the truth of that general\u0027s march, the captains and foremost men of them assembled to decide upon what should be done. Cristóbal de Sotelo understood the wiliness of his enemies very well. He said \"They want to deceive us with the truth, and what they really intend is to effect a junction with Alvarado. In my opinion we ought to intercept them, for we are quite able to do so.\" Saying this, he ordered that they should move to encounter the enemy by a shortcut leading to the main road. Juan de Herrada, since he did not want to have a battle, would not consent; but made various excuses, saying that they should go to Jauja, and that there was time enough to follow them, if they really had taken the road to Bombon. So, as they would not follow the opinion and advice of Cristóbal de Sotelo, they moved on in good order towards Jauja, and marched until they reached the valley. As they were under the dual command of Cristóbal de Sotelo and García de Alvarado there could not be good management, because if one gave an order it seemed inexpedient to the other, and he ordered the contrary. We have said in other places that Sotelo was judicious. He saw that if he and García de Alvarado were both to be in command, the cause must be lost. He therefore said that, in view of this evil, he desired no other authority than his personality, apart from a military rank, secured to him. He added that García de Alvarado was a cavalier of such high standing that he was well able to[173] undertake the office of General alone and, with the advice of his captains, he could conduct any war as might be necessary. What Sotelo said appeared good to all, and García de Alvarado remained sole General, although most of the soldiers, and even most of the captains, regretted that Sotelo was not their leader. For Sotelo knew well how to treat soldiers, and while keeping strict discipline he was nevertheless beloved. \n \n Pero Alvarez, with his people, continued the march to Bombon, much pleased at having passed through the valley of Jauja. He always sent on his scouts in advance of the main body, and a captain and some light, active men were always with the rear guard, so that if the enemy should follow in pursuit they could not take him by surprise and rob the baggage. They marched in good order, always keeping a bright look-out. \n \n When the men of Chile arrived at Jauja, Cristóbal de Sotelo having resigned, and García de Alvarado being in sole command, the captains again met to consult over what should be done. There was great regret that Pero Alvarez had not been pursued, for from Pariacaca they could have turned his front and cut him off. They decided to follow him in very light order, leaving their baggage behind. They set out briskly after the Cuzco party; but the country was very rough, and the fury of the winter was not yet over, the heavens discharging such heavy rains as to swell the rivers, and render progress very laborious for the wayfarers. The Indians, seeing the movements that were being attempted, carried off the food supplies and absented themselves, so as not to have the road covered with the bodies of those whom the Christians, in witness of their cruelty, would work to death and leave behind. All these things made the march so difficult that it was by no means easy for the one camp to overtake the other. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971/56472.html","bookId":729,"book":{"id":729,"title":"The War of Chupas","description":"简介： Pedro de Cieza de Len was, on the whole, the most important historian, and is now the best authority, on ancient Peru, so far as his work has reached us; for he was a great traveller, and an eye-witness of much that he described....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM"}}
