{"id":23697,"no":69,"title":"CHAPTER LXVIII","content":"How the Governor Vaca de Castro decided to send his army to the province of Jauja, while he himself went to Lima. \n \n THE reader will remember that, farther back, we told how Vaca de Castro arrived in the province of Guaraz, and how he was acknowledged as Governor and Captain-General in the name of the King: and other things. A few days later an assembly of captains and principal cavaliers was summoned, to consider what ought to be done for the pacification of the Realm. It was agreed that the captains should be posted to the command of the several companies, and that they and the sergeants and other officers were to understand that the war was undertaken by the Governor Vaca de Castro\u0027s orders. He appointed the captains to their former companies, and issued commissions to them without making any change except in the case of Pero Alvarez Holguin, who still looked to be General. But Vaca de Castro wanted that office and dignity for himself, which Pero Alvarez begrudged him. These things having been arranged by the Governor, he asked the captains and principal cavaliers to rejoice and make merry, seeing that the mercy of God our Lord in uniting their forces together had been very great. On hearing this, they arranged tournaments with canes and rings;[112] and the Governor entertained them at his tent. After their festivities he named the licentiate León as chief magistrate of the camp; and because Pero Alvarez learnt that his authority as Camp Master was not to extend beyond military affairs, and not to touch the administration of justice, he began[233] to complain, and to say that that was how his services were being requited. Vaca de Castro desired to establish complete concord among his people; so without withdrawing the duty given to the licentiate León, he sent to tell Pero Alvarez that, since he was a gentleman, he should give his attention to serving God and the King, and that, in the exercise of the office he held, he might take over certain pikemen over whom to be captain; for the Governor desired that, except himself, no person there should rank before Pero Alvarez. With this order all questions ended between the Governor and his officers and all were content, unless it were the captain Gómez de Tordoya, who entertained enmity towards Pero Alvarez. Although he was given a company of mounted men, he would not take charge of them, but wanted to be merely a private soldier entering into the battle. He was a very close friend and kinsman of the captain Garcilaso de la Vega, and tried to persuade him by means of words to take the same course as himself. Garcilaso wishing to see the realm at peace and to do just what might be his Majesty\u0027s pleasure, would not, in all loyalty, do anything but what the Governor ordered him. \n \n These things having passed, and the companies having become known to their respective captains, it was found that they had no good pikes, which caused them great concern. But there happened to be one Cervantes there, a resident of Lima, and this man knew where there was wood suitable for making pikes, in the province of Jauja, where he held some Indians in encomienda. He offered to go and see to the matter. He went to Jauja and arranged with the Indians to cut wood in the forests, for making pikes sufficient for the war, and many very good ones were turned out. The captains then again entered into consultation with the Governor, and they agreed that it would be well to send scouts into the province of Jauja to learn the[234] state of affairs beyond and gain that region for the King. It having been decided that this should be done, they told off Captain Diego de Rojas, with troops sufficient for the purpose, to undertake this duty. Diego de Rojas thereupon set out with those who were to go with him. After further consultation between the Governor and the captains it was their opinion that the Governor should go down to the coast valleys and proceed to Lima, where his lieutenant Aliaga was in charge, in order to obtain money for the payment of the soldiers, and to enlist men wherewith to increase his forces. They also agreed that the captain Pedro Anzures should go to the city of San Miguel and arrest a certain Santiago, a rich man who lived there, and had plenty of money, and who had shown himself to be a friend of Don Diego. His goods were to be sequestrated, and any money of his that they might find was to be brought to Lima by way of the coast road. So Pedro Anzures presently set out. Then the Governor ordered the captains Pero Alvarez and Alonso de Alvarado to lead the troops into the province of Jauja without halting, and form the camp there pending the Governor\u0027s arrival from Lima to join them. Having ordered these things, Vaca de Castro proceeded to Lima, sending messengers before him to announce his approach. As all those who were left in Lima were friends of the Marquis, they were very glad when they heard that the Governor was coming, and they gave him a grand reception. He made his entry on the eve of Corpus Christi. \n \n The licentiate Benito Suárez de Caravajal, who was then in Lima, came out to welcome him, as well as his brother Illán Suárez de Caravajal the factor, the captain Diego de Agüero, the treasurer Alonso de Riquelme, the lieutenant Jerónimo de Aliaga and the magistrates, and with them the Governor Barrionuevo. After they had kissed hands and the ceremonies usual at similar functions had been[235] gone through, Vaca de Castro was lodged, and very well regaled by the inhabitants. As he was entering the city the Factor addressed him in the name of all the rest, saying that he was as welcome as the Gran Capitán had been in Italy, as to all that would conduce to the service of his Majesty, and that he and all the gentlemen of that city were ready to serve him and do all things in his Majesty\u0027s interests, like loyal subjects. The Governor thanked him and showed pleasure at what the Factor had said. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971/56490.html","bookId":729,"book":{"id":729,"title":"The War of Chupas","description":"简介： Pedro de Cieza de Len was, on the whole, the most important historian, and is now the best authority, on ancient Peru, so far as his work has reached us; for he was a great traveller, and an eye-witness of much that he described....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM"}}
