{"id":23686,"no":58,"title":"CHAPTER LVII","content":"How the captain Pedro de Vergara spoke to the Governor Vaca de Castro about providing some relief for the soldiers who had come with him, and how the Governor arrived at Truxillo. AS the captain Pedro de Vergara had been engaged for a long time in the subjugation of the Bracamoros, indeed, ever since the battle of Las Salinas, those who came with him had worn out all their clothing. Their need was so great, that they spoke to Pedro de Vergara, their leader, to ask the Governor Vaca de Castro to afford them some relief, by reason of their great desire to serve the king. Vaca de Castro heard from the captain of their condition, and ordered equipment and things they were in want of, to the value of 10,000 pesos de oro, to be provided for them. With this help they were much pleased and contented. Vaca de Castro did nothing without consulting Lorenzo de Aldana, and he intended to nominate him Camp Master of the army which was mustering where the captains were encamped. After having rested a sufficient time they started for the city of Truxillo, and when the citizens and dwellers in that place learnt that Vaca de Castro had come they received him with great willingness, and showed a desire to serve his Majesty in all that the Governor might direct. So he was personally acknowledged as Governor in the presence of the assembled regidores and alcaldes, as commanded by his Majesty\u0027s royal authority. Since leaving Spain, the Governor Vaca de Castro had passed through great hardships, and had made long journeys. He was a man of refined habits and had only been accustomed to work in his study, so that he now found himself much broken down and needing rest. But[194] to think of stopping still in any place until Don Diego should return to his Majesty\u0027s service or be obliged, by force of arms, to give up calling himself Governor (to which he had no title whatever) and surrender the province he had occupied, seemed to him a mistake. So he was anxious to leave Truxillo promptly, and during the days he was there he busied himself with disposing affairs as seemed best for the task in hand. At Truxillo he found Gómez de Tordoya and Garcilaso de la Vega, with whom he spent much of his time. On learning the reason of their coming he spoke to them most amicably, saying that among gentlemen there should be no discord nor cause for enmity. He added that his Majesty would be informed of their services, and that they should be well rewarded. Some say that Gómez de Tordoya spoke well of the affairs of Pero Alvarez; others say that he did not, but rather gave the Governor to understand that the greater part of the honour of having raised the banner in Cuzco in the name of his Majesty belonged to himself alone, and that Pero Alvarez already knew at Lima, before he came to Cuzco to invade the Chunchos, that the Marquis was doomed to suffer death at the hands of the men of Chile—and that if Pero Alvarez had been chosen General, \u0027twas in order that he and those with him should not declare for Don Diego against the loyalists, who were so few that they would not have been able to obtain their desire (which was to serve the King) if he had wanted to prevent it. And further, that Pero Alvarez was so ambitious to have charge and command, that if the present holder should wish to deprive him of it, it would not take much for him to become an enemy, or to refuse obedience. They also say that when Vaca de Castro heard those things, he was much chagrined, but concealed his emotion that it might not be thought he feared lest Pero Alvarez, feeling his own power, would not pursue the war under his[195] authority. Presently he ordered all those who were going with him to get ready to start at once, because letters from both camps had arrived, urging him not to delay joining the other forces, but rather to hurry on their union in the interests of his Majesty\u0027s service. When those in the city of Truxillo saw that the Governor wanted to depart, they entered into consultation to discuss which would be the best route for him to take. Some thought that he ought to go to Lima, assemble all the men he could collect there, and go up with them to Jauja, where the other captains should be ordered to join him with their respective forces. Others thought that unsuitable, and that he should first go to Guaraz and be acknowledged by officers and men as Governor and Captain-General. It was finally decided that he should go first to Guaraz; and this opinion being assented to by all, he departed from the city of Truxillo, leaving Diego de Mora as Lieutenant and Justice, in the King\u0027s name. He marched, with those who had mustered to accompany him, until they reached the valley known as Santa, where he took the road up into the mountains.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971/56479.html","bookId":729,"book":{"id":729,"title":"The War of Chupas","description":"简介： Pedro de Cieza de Len was, on the whole, the most important historian, and is now the best authority, on ancient Peru, so far as his work has reached us; for he was a great traveller, and an eye-witness of much that he described....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM"}}
