{"id":23693,"no":65,"title":"CHAPTER LXIV","content":"How the captains García de Alvarado and Saucedo went to ask Cristóbal de Sotelo to pardon the soldiers he had in prison, and of their fate; and of what else happened until García de Alvarado killed the good knight Cristóbal de Sotelo. \n \n AS the soldiers in Cuzco were not well under control, their feeling was that, provided it were not against military discipline or matters relating to the war, there ought to be no punishment for any crime they might commit. They therefore became very riotous when they heard of the imprisonment of the Machines. Don Diego presently knew of the arrest, but took no steps. García de Alvarado and Saucedo determined each to go to Sotelo, and ask him to pardon those men that he had under arrest. Saucedo being the first to call at the prison, admission was refused him, nor would Sotelo do anything in response to the request made to him. Then Saucedo shouted at him that he had better take care what he was about, for the prisoners were his friends and he was going to demand justice. Cristóbal de Sotelo was much enraged at these words, and answered by telling Saucedo to go to his lodging; if not, he would put him where he was soon going to put the prisoners. Saucedo then went away and joined García de Alvarado, who, by this time, was also near; but although he too knocked at the door, they would not open it nor answer him. Sotelo, after holding an enquiry into[216] the affair for which the men had been arrested, sentenced one of them to be hanged. \n \n Now that the day was approaching when the field of Chupas and its slopes would absorb much noble Spanish blood, and the party of the Almagros would come to an end, it was meet, and necessary for its destruction, and for the due commemoration of the Marquis\u0027s obsequies, that envy and malice should bring about the death and removal of the principal captains among the men of Chile, so that those of the Pachacama party might encounter less resistance in completing the triumph that was to be theirs. For Francisco de Chaves being already dead, and Juan de Herrada having been poisoned (as they say) by Juan Balsa, the only captains left to them were Cristóbal de Sotelo and García de Alvarado. And so, that these should come to an end like the others, it fell out in this wise.[106] \n \n García de Alvarado, being a spirited youth, and having come from Arequipa very proud of bringing in so much stolen treasure, began to feel aggrieved because Sotelo was more considered than himself and always first and foremost above the rest. He set about to making friendships, feigned or true, with many who had been soldiers under Francisco de Chaves, and were on bad terms with Sotelo because they said their old captain\u0027s death was due to him. García de Alvarado now wormed himself into their[217] favour so as to make use of them when necessity should arise; though he thought little of Don Diego de Almagro himself. He next began to distribute the money he had brought among those who were his friends and who appeared to him to be on his side, glad always to asperse Sotelo and to belittle his affairs. The accomplices with García de Alvarado in this business, and those who went among the soldiers for him, probing their dispositions, were Rodrigo Nú?ez, who had been the old Adelantado\u0027s Camp Master, a man of little knowledge and less judgment, Martín Carrillo, Juan Rodríguez Barragán, and many others. \n \n Cristóbal de Sotelo did not fail to perceive García de Alvarado\u0027s design against him, but as he was prudent he pretended to treat it with unconcern and not pay much attention to it. Nevertheless they say that he spoke to Don Diego on the subject. But since García de Alvarado had won over many of the soldiers who were in the city, and some of the veterans who had followed the banners of the old Adelantado, he covertly and of set purpose raised the question as to who was to be General of the camp, himself or Cristóbal de Sotelo, so that they should declare that he and no other should be the one. In those days Sotelo was laid up with a calenture, owing to which he passed a serpent or worm from below, a fathom in length, and he rather suspected that he had been given poisonous herbs. Don Diego and all the captains and citizens went to visit him, and so did many of the soldiers who were his friends. He said before some of them that he cared nothing for any Alvarados, past or present, the which being overheard, it was not long before García de Alvarado got to know of it. He was offended, nursed evil intentions against Sotelo, and resolved to kill him. Riding one day through the city with some of his friends, García de Alvarado met Juan Balsa, who was also mounted; and[218] proposed to him that they should go and visit the captain Cristóbal de Sotelo, as he was ill. Juan Balsa said he was willing, and, taking leave of Alvarado\u0027s other companions, they went. There went with them one Juan García, of Guadalcanal, and Diego Pérez Becerra, great friends of García de Alvarado. When they reached Sotelo\u0027s lodging they entered his bedroom, and after a few words had passed, García de Alvarado said: \"Why did you say that you held the Alvarados as nought, and other things which have been reported to me, and are to my detriment or against my honour? You must give me satisfaction.\" At the time when this happened, Sotelo, besides being ill, had no friend or servant present with him, although there were usually plenty in the house. As his illness had not diminished, but indeed was rather worse, he replied that he was not in a condition to answer him or give satisfaction; for that he was not himself, and indeed so ill that he was passing devils and serpents from his body. Juan Balsa showed himself, in his words, to be favourable to Sotelo. He said to García de Alvarado that it was not a time for settling such affairs, and he got up as if about to go. García de Alvarado, seeing him rise, did the same and took leave of Sotelo. Cristóbal de Sotelo, being a man of spirit, and one who held his honour very dear, after thinking over for a little in his own mind what had passed between him and García de Alvarado, loudly called him back, and said: \"I do not remember having said of you nor of any Alvarados what you allege, but if I did say anything heretofore I repeat that, being who I am, I do not concern myself much about Alvarados.\" When García de Alvarado heard that he exclaimed in a great rage, \"I swear to God that I shall have to kill you, Sir Traitor.\" Sotelo, jumping out of bed, cried out \"I will kill you.\" \n \n García de Alvarado, clapping his hand upon his sword, made towards the infirm Sotelo to wound him, but Juan[219] Balsa, with great promptitude, made a spring at the assailant, and threw his arms round him. Sotelo went into an inner chamber, where there was one of his servants, named Lizcano, and looking round for arms, saw only a sword and a cloak. With these he came out to where García de Alvarado and Juan Balsa were talking. By this time some of García de Alvarado\u0027s friends had come along, and had surrounded the house. Alvarado had freed himself from Juan Balsa and now came in alone, with his sword raised, looking for Sotelo. But when Sotelo\u0027s servant saw him advancing he assailed him from behind, and gripped him tightly in his arms. Sotelo, seeing his enemy so near, came forward to kill him; but Juan Balsa stayed his hands, saying that he must not do such a thing. Meanwhile Alvarado, although the servant Lizcano bore him down, managed to get clear and wounded him on the head, and then made at Sotelo to kill him, and gave him several stabs and cuts. Hearing the noise, Juan García, whom we mentioned above, came in and wounded Sotelo so seriously that, in a short time, he lay dead on the floor, clasped by Juan Balsa, either to rescue him from death or in his eagerness to see him dead—which latter is my belief and I hold to be the more certain of what they say. In this manner died the foremost and most upright leader among the party of the \"men of Chile.\" In his death may be clearly seen the fall and destruction of them all, for had he remained alive, he would by his prudence have guided subsequent affairs in a different way from that in which they came about. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971/56486.html","bookId":729,"book":{"id":729,"title":"The War of Chupas","description":"简介： Pedro de Cieza de Len was, on the whole, the most important historian, and is now the best authority, on ancient Peru, so far as his work has reached us; for he was a great traveller, and an eye-witness of much that he described....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM"}}
