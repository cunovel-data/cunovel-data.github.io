{"id":23685,"no":57,"title":"CHAPTER LVI","content":"How the Governor Vaca de Castro ordered the Adelantado Belalcázar to return to his government, and how he was informed of Pero Alvarez having entered into Guaraz; and how, being at Motupe, Don Alonso de Montemayor and the captain Vasco de Guevara came to him there. \\n\\n \\n\\n AFTER the arquebusiers who were sent by Captain Pedro de Vergara arrived, a messenger named Francisco de las Balsas, also sent by Vergara, came with the news that Pero Alvarez had taken the field in the service of the King against Don Diego, and that he and Gómez de Tordoya were at Guaraz with a strong force, waiting for the Governor\u0027s arrival. The Governor was heartily pleased with this news, and rendered devout thanks to our Lord. And there was great satisfaction among all those who were with him, looking forward to the hour that would see them united with the men under the captains Pero Alvarez and Alonso de Alvarado, for there were upwards of 400 Spaniards, very brilliant men, and many of them cavaliers of high birth. He learnt too that the captains Pedro Anzures and Garcilaso de la Vega and the people of the town of Plata had united with Pero Alvarez, and that Don Diego had followed them to near Bombon, and everything else that had happened. When the Governor Vaca de Castro had received such joyful news, than which none other could afford him greater happiness, he considered, since he was still feeling dissatisfied at having the Adelantado Belalcázar in his company that this gave him a pretext for ordering him to return. He, therefore, spoke to Lorenzo de Aldana, and instructed him to tell Belalcázar that the time had now come for him to return to his own government, where the natives were in revolt and required to be brought into subjection;[189] and that now that Alonso de Alvarado and Pero Alvarez, with so many cavaliers, had declared themselves servants of the king, his services could be dispensed with. The Adelantado replied, to what Lorenzo de Aldana had said to him on the part of the Governor, that he was there to serve his Majesty, that he ought not to be ordered to return, because it would be a very great disgrace for him to go back in that manner, and it would be said that it had been for another reason. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Governor ordered his secretary, Sebastián de Merlo, to go to the lodgings of the Adelantado and to notify him by command on the part of his Majesty, that he was required to return at once to his own government to place it in order, because this was desirable for the service of the King our Lord; and that, if he did not do so, he could not be looked upon as doing the king\u0027s service, nor be regarded as possessing the loyalty that was expected from him as a subject and Governor of the king. The Governor ordered that this should be notified to the Adelantado Belalcázar apart, where no other person could overhear. Merlo went immediately to do this, and arrived in the presence of Adelantado. On reading the order of Vaca de Castro, Belalcázar was very much disturbed, and directed the people who were with him, and who had come from his government, to accompany him to the Governor Vaca de Castro. Merlo went before him, to apprise Vaca de Castro of the coming of Belalcázar with his followers. Without making any fuss, Vaca de Castro ordered the cavaliers who were with him to be watchful lest Belalcázar should attempt anything [in the nature of violence], and directed the arquebusiers to be ready, with arquebuses in their hands. Belalcázar came, accompanied by his followers, to where Vaca de Castro was, and when their arrival was announced the latter ordered that he be allowed to enter. Belalcázar entered alone, with a rueful countenance,[190] and said that he was astonished at what had been communicated to him with reference to returning to his government. His departure from it, as the Governor knew, was to serve his Majesty in this campaign, and not to return until Don Diego had been punished for his insurrection in the Realm of Peru. If he returned, some people would think that there was some sufficient cause for it, or that he had shown himself an approver and favourer of Don Diego. Having heard what Belalcázar said, and his arguments to clear himself of the impression the Governor had of him, Vaca de Castro replied with very serious words. He said that he did not doubt that Belalcázar had always shown himself to be a very loyal servant of his Majesty, who had entrusted him as such with the government of a distant province. He, Vaca de Castro, would not have thought any other thing of Belalcázar if it had not come to his certain knowledge that he, and his people, had favoured Francisco Nú?ez de Pedroso, so that he might escape without hindrance or punishment, and had supplied him with a horse and guides to conduct him by a route where he could not be found; also in Quito, and other places, he had not only tried to show, but had given to understand by his words, that Don Diego had acted very properly in putting the Marquis to death. For these reasons, and because the captains up beyond had upheld the king\u0027s word with great energy, he had sent to order Belalcázar to return to his government. He now again admonished the Adelantado to do so, for he had not yet secured tranquillity among the natives of his government nor had they ceased to be rebellious. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Adelantado would gladly have gone onwards, and not returned to his government, as he felt that it would bring disgrace upon him; but though he protested much, it did not avail with Vaca de Castro. Seeing that he would have to return, he said it would appear to his followers as[191] if he had committed some fault, and he asked that an order might be given to obviate this. Vaca de Castro, to content him, wrote from there to his Majesty the king, saying that the Adelantado returned to do his duties in the government to which he had been appointed, because, in Peru, Pero Alvarez and Alvarado had declared for the king\u0027s service, and the Adelantado\u0027s help was no longer necessary. This was written that his Majesty might not consider he had always been ill served by the Adelantado. And to satisfy those who were with him it was agreed that he returned because he was an old man and had so much to attend to in his own government. Next day, the Adelantado took his leave, and all that we have related was done, and it was believed that the Governor had no feeling against him. He was attended by the men from Cali and others who were in his company, until they arrived at Quito, whence they proceeded to the government of Popayán. \\n\\n \\n\\n While at the same place Vaca de Castro received news that the messengers from the captains were near at hand, at which he rejoiced. Presently he continued the journey until he arrived at the buildings of Cayambe, where the messengers reached him, and delivered the letters from the captains. From them Vaca de Castro was glad to gain full particulars of all they had done. He made the messengers very welcome, and he sent back very gracious letters, giving the captains to understand that his Majesty would grant them substantial rewards, as they had proved themselves loyal servants. He added that he would use all possible despatch to join them, admonishing them to preserve concord in the meanwhile among themselves, and to treat the Indians in such wise that they would have no grievance, and would not absent themselves on account of any ill usage. He wrote in like strain to the captain Alonso de Alvarado, and to the cavaliers and soldiers who were with him. \\n\\n \\n\\n [192] \\n\\n \\n\\n At this time, Vaca de Castro\u0027s commission having arrived, he had been acknowledged as Governor throughout the Realm, excepting the part where Don Diego and his captains held sway. In the rest, the Justices were for the king and in his name. Gómez de Tordoya, when he left the camp at Guaraz to seek Vaca de Castro, came as far as Truxillo, where the latter was expected, it being known that he was on the way. Don Alonso de Montemayor and the captain Vasco de Guevara went on to join Vaca de Castro, leaving the camp of Pero Alvarez, with his permission, before he halted at Guaraz. Although at Truxillo they heard that Vaca de Castro had left Quito, they did not wait there, but pushed on to meet him. Vaca de Castro marched until he reached the valley of Jayanque, where Don Alonso de Montemayor, Vasco de Guevara, and Pedro de Vergara, with the men brought from Bracamoros, happened to be awaiting him. Vaca de Castro was much pleased when he met them there, and especially so at the arrival of Vergara, praising the zeal he had shown in coming forward to serve his Majesty. He then asked Don Alonso and Vasco de Guevara several questions about what happened in Lima at the time the Marquis was killed, and was informed by them. Some of those who came with the Governor counselled him not to trust Guevara nor Don Alonso either, as they had been very close friends of the Adelantado Don Diego de Almagro. Though he did not show that he felt any suspicion of them, he took care that their arrival should cause no mischief. But they were both resolved to serve his Majesty. Don Alonso de Montemayor was always very loyal, as he appeared afterwards at the time when the Viceroy came to Peru, for he was one of those who followed and served him most diligently. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971/56478.html","bookId":729,"book":{"id":729,"title":"The War of Chupas","description":"简介： Pedro de Cieza de Len was, on the whole, the most important historian, and is now the best authority, on ancient Peru, so far as his work has reached us; for he was a great traveller, and an eye-witness of much that he described....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM"}}
