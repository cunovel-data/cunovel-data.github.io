AFTER the events we have related had passed in the city of Cuzco, there did not cease to be some tumult in the city following the death of Cristóbal de Sotelo. Don Diego, who felt most keenly the insolence of García de Alvarado, reflected within himself what scheme would lead to the satisfaction of his desire, which was that no one else, with the example of García de Alvarado before him, should attempt another treason such as that person had perpetrated. He also wanted to get rid of García de Alvarado as a companion, in order to advance his desire and give effect to his plans. Summoning to a consultation the captains and old soldiers who were entirely faithful to him, through having followed the banners of the Adelantado his father, Juan Balsa was with the assent of them all nominated Captain-General—a man unworthy of such a charge; and the troop lately Cristóbal de Sotelo\u0027s was entrusted to Diego Méndez, because he was known to cherish enmity against García de Alvarado, who was still[223] esconced in the fortified house with his supporters. As the soldiers in Cuzco had now received news of the entry of Vaca de Castro into the Realm, they felt the necessity for peace among themselves in order to be in a position to resist attack, come whence it might; and they therefore approached their captains, with a view to mediation between Don Diego and García de Alvarado. But as the latter knew he was to blame in reference to past transactions, he asked that Don Diego would make him his Captain-General and give him sufficient power to govern the camp in Don Diego\u0027s name. Failing that, Alvarado would not trust to promises, but in that way his person would be secure and he would serve Don Diego loyally. The latter desired to punish Alvarado, but, seeing there was no other course open, he agreed to give him the power that was requested and to appoint him his General, first arranging with Juan Balsa and others to concert crafty and cautious plans to kill him. So Alvarado was presently sent a commission naming him General and Deputy-Governor. When they delivered it to him he tore it up in front of the officer who had brought it, and spoke ugly words against Don Diego because it did not include power to displace and appoint captains, declaring that he was not the man to be contented with limited power. And as he had heard it said that Juan Balsa had previously been named for General, he conceived that Balsa must have intrigued with Don Diego not to give the full powers he claimed. So he talked with some friends about a way to kill Balsa, by sending to call him up and then stabbing him. His friends replied they would execute his command. So Alvarado sent one of his henchmen to Juan Balsa, requesting him to be so particularly kind as to come to his house, as he wished to talk some things over with him. When the messenger arrived and Juan Balsa, who was not a little wary and cunning, learnt the nature of his errand,[224] he immediately guessed it was to complain about the commission Don Diego had sent to Alvarado; and he thought that he might soothe him by means of smooth words and lure him to the house of Don Diego, where he could be killed. So he went with the messenger to García de Alvarado\u0027s house, where he was courteously received with outward goodwill, though with the real object and intention we have mentioned. When he had come in, García de Alvarado said to him: \"I am astonished, Juan Balsa, that Don Diego should have wished every one to know that he does not show me the friendship due for the splendid things I have done in his service and the loyalty with which I have followed him. Ingratitude is a sin which is not easily forgiven. The leaders who take part in wars like this, and whom Don Diego treats as if they were his vassals, endure much at the hands of his friends, and put up with many things to avoid coming to a rupture with them and losing his favour. He has chosen to show as much anger with me for the death of Sotelo, as if his happiness depended wholly upon that captain\u0027s life, and his troubles and misfortunes arose solely from his death. He does not consider the good reason I had for killing Sotelo, and the little cause he had to oust me from his service. But after all, neither does my honour nor my personal existence require that I should change my fortunes or deny him my friendship. If Don Diego will consider the times, and how profitable it is to have friends, and will send me the commission with adequate power, as I asked for it to be, he shall keep me as devoted to his service as I have been from after the death of the old Marquis until now.\" García de Alvarado believed that Juan Balsa would answer peevishly, which would afford an occasion for killing him. But Juan Balsa, who well knew what he was about, replied very blandly, saying that if Don Diego had not sent Alvarado power in the commission to appoint[225] and discharge captains, it was owing to an omission by the scrivener, and that he himself should draw the commission and have it written out for him, Balsa, to then bring back signed by Don Diego. As for himself, added Balsa, he wished it so, knowing that it would be advantageous for them all to have Don García as General. It was true that Don Diego had nominated him, Balsa, as General some few days previously, but he had voluntarily declined the charge, desiring that Alvarado should be the lord and chief over them all, because he was so much looked up to by the people. These things, and others of like plausibility, said Juan Balsa—resourceful man that he was in such contingencies—to García de Alvarado, under an artful veil of great caution. Alvarado, believing what Balsa told him, replied very graciously, giving him to know that he had sent for him to kill him, but now that he understood his views and good wishes he would always look upon him as a true friend. He asked him to procure the commission he desired from Don Diego, and let him know how truly he was his servant and friend. Juan Balsa, after promising that he would do this, departed for the house of Don Diego, where he gave him an account of all that had passed between him and Alvarado. He and others then advised that the commission should be sent to García de Alvarado in the form he wanted, and that, when time and place should subserve, he should be killed. Don Diego did not like it, feeling that the scheme betrayed a lack of courage, and that he was losing his authority; but, seeing that it was advisable, he ordered the commission to be made out in the form García de Alvarado wanted and, after he had signed it, he sent it to him. With this García de Alvarado felt himself secure, and was content. He went forth from his quarters well escorted, and was proclaimed in the public square of the city, to the sound of many[226] trumpets, and was acknowledged by all the soldiers. Meanwhile Don Diego bided his time for a chance to kill Alvarado, fearing lest this person might want to do the same with him as he had done to Cristóbal de Sotelo.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971/56488.html","bookId":729,"book":{"id":729,"title":"The War of Chupas","description":"简介： Pedro de Cieza de Len was, on the whole, the most important historian, and is now the best authority, on ancient Peru, so far as his work has reached us; for he was a great traveller, and an eye-witness of much that he described....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM"}}
