{"id":23707,"no":79,"title":"CHAPTER LXXVIII","content":"Of the cruel battle between Vaca de Castro and Don Diego de Almagro, and how the men of Chile were routed and defeated with the loss of many lives, and their party for ever undone. \\n\\n \\n\\n THE night having passed with great fears and hopes, each party thinking that they had justice on their side, the captains ordered the ensigns to muster their companies, and to give the signal by beat of drum that the soldiers, on hearing it, might know that the time for giving battle was so near that it only needed one side to strike the first blow. So the men of Chile went forth full of ardour, and raising their shouts to heaven, advanced with their hearts animated against their foes, and with minds longing to satisfy their hatred of their enemies. Their artillery, consisting of sixteen pieces, was placed in a good position, so that, from whatever point the enemy might try to assail it, it would overcome all attacks. The cavalry was formed into two squadrons, one under Don Diego himself and Juan Balsa, the other led by the captains Saucedo and Diego Méndez. One of these squadrons was larger than the other, and its flanks were held by Diego de Hoces and the same Diego Méndez. The infantry, stationed in rear of the artillery, was under Martín de Bilbao; and Martín Cote, a most valiant captain, led the arquebusiers, having detailed those necessary for the front of the squadron and either flank. The standard was planted[276] near the squadron led by Don Diego, and Pedro de Candía was with the artillery, ready to fire whenever the order should be given. The Sergeant-Major, Pedro Suárez, went about from one part to another, giving necessary orders. He was relied upon for his knowledge of war, having served in several countries, and being well versed in the art. In the forefront of the squadron there were men at arms posted, and the whole force numbered 550 Spaniards, a very brilliant array, for in truth there were cavaliers of good family, as we have pointed out in several places.[133] \\n\\n \\n\\n While Don Diego and his followers were marshalling their forces, Vaca de Castro ordered Lope Martín, a bold man, to mount his horse and go forward to reconnoitre the enemy\u0027s position. He did so, and returned after he had seen them, telling the Camp-Master Francisco de Caravajal how the artillery was placed. As soon as he knew this, he ordered his men to march more to the right, and led the way himself, saying many witty things. Then they saw that it was time to marshal the squadrons, and placed them in the positions assigned to them, with their banners. The captains Pero Alvarez Holguin, Gómez de Alvarado, Garcilaso de la Vega, and Pedro Anzures, with their companies of horsemen, formed one squadron. In the other[277] was the captain Alonso de Alvarado, with his cavalry, and the royal standard. The infantry were formed up between the cavalry squadrons, with the captains Pedro de Vergara and Juan Vélez de Guevara at their head, and the captain Castro with the vanguard. They had 160 arquebusiers, and they mustered in all more than 700 Spaniards. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Governor Vaca de Castro did not enter into the battle. He remained apart from the actual fray, giving it to be understood by his words that he wanted to fight, but, as the captains represented to him that this was not desirable, he retired. He sent to the squadron of Alonso de Alvarado, where the royal standard, then borne by Cristóbal de Barrientos was, saying that he desired twenty-seven of the principal persons to accompany him as an escort and bodyguard. When Alonso de Alvarado heard this, he sent to say that such a thing was not permissible; that, in an army of 20,000 men, the withdrawal or retention of even twenty men might turn the scale of victory. Although Vaca de Castro saw that there was reason in this, he again ordered his captain of the guard, Rodrigo de Ocampo, to come to him with Lorenzo de Aldana, Diego de Agüero, Francisco de Godoy, Diego Maldonado, the licentiate León, Antonio Navarro, Sebastián de Merlo, Cristóbal de Burgos, Nicolás de Ribera, and others up to twenty-seven; and these, whilst wishing to remain at the front, turned to obey the order of Vaca de Castro. \\n\\n \\n\\n At this juncture, both sides discharged their arquebuses; and Francisco de Caravajal said: \"Forward! good cavaliers, forward! advance without fear, and care nought for the arquebuses. Look at me, how fat I am, yet I go forward without feeling any fear of them.\" As they approached each other, the noise and the shouting were very great. Both parties advanced courageously, those of Don Diego shouting \"Long live the King and Almagro,\" and the others \"Long live the King and Vaca de Castro,\" all[278] calling upon the name of the apostle Saint James, while the bullets from the arquebuses filled the air. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Camp-Master Pero Alvarez Holguin, after having passed through and shown some excitement during the day, charged his horse against the enemy, wishing to show his contempt for his opponents. Though men of great valour are often not recognized in the smoke of battle, Holguin was known by the device he wore. The enemy\u0027s arquebuses were pointed against him, and he was hit by two bullets before he could break his lance. He fell to the ground in the throes of death, and never spoke again—just able to make a sign to his men to dash at the enemy. Gómez de Tordoya was also wounded so badly that he died a few days afterwards. And now the two sides encountered each other, both infuriated one against the other. A great disaster to the men of Chile then happened. It was that, when the captain Saucedo saw that the sharpshooters were employing their arquebuses with effect, and had caused some deaths, he thought it would be well to move the artillery to another position, where one of the enemy\u0027s flanks was exposed—not noticing that it was already so placed as to rout them all the moment they should advance a little farther. He therefore ordered Pedro de Candía to move it, upon seeing which Sergeant-Major Suárez called out loudly to him not to budge, for if it did not remain where it was posted they were lost. But his words were disregarded and Candía transferred the guns to the position Saucedo had directed. Then the enemies mingled in the open with the soldiers of Almagro, and, though many cannon shots were fired off, only one took effect, which did much damage, tearing heads from bodies, and breaking the legs and arms of others. The other shots were fired, as some say, too high, or missed their mark owing to the artillery being so badly placed. \\n\\n \\n\\n By this time great damage had been done and there were many dead. But were I to set forth in detail each[279] one who, when about to discharge a bolt, was shot through the heart by a bullet and so instantly fell dead,—or whose arms were shot away just as he was placing the match to fire,—or others killed suddenly by a bullet just as they were couching the lance or drawing the sword, the tale would never end. The squadrons of horse clashed, brother breaking lance against brother, but in that desperate peril no man would have hesitated to wound even his father, if he had seen him. One Garcia de Mala, having lost an arm, went forth out of the battle to where Vaca de Castro waited, and asked him why he was not helping his people. On hearing this Diego de Agüero rushed excitedly into the fray, and confronted the enemy. A bullet passed through the mouth of Antonio de Loaysa, and knocked out several of his back teeth, causing him to swoon. The cavalry fought with desperate valour and with a fervour so inflamed by anger, that no one cared to be wanting in ability to wound. Antonio de Robles, having been thrown from his horse, without losing his intrepidity, and he had not a little, turned with much agility towards the artillery and wounded one of the gunners, also getting wounded himself. Pedro de Candía did not discharge any more shots. The noise made by all was very great. \\n\\n \\n\\n The lad Don Diego whilst fighting away, was told that there had been treason in the artillery firing. It is said that he went to Pedro de Candía and exclaimed: \"Traitor! why have you sold me?\" and thrusting at him with his lance, killed him. Others will have it that Candía used deceit with Don Diego and was disloyal in the matter of the artillery, but that he was killed by some soldiers of Vaca de Castro who penetrated to where he was stationed. Don Diego, seeing that his life depended on gaining the victory, went about in all parts of the battle animating his men. \\n\\n \\n\\n The captain Alonso de Alvarado, on this day, gave proofs of his valour, and fought with great intrepidity.[280] Diego de Rojas, Pedro Anzures, Garcilaso de la Vega, and Pedro de Vergara did likewise. The same is said of Juan Vélez de Guevara. The captain Martín de Bilbao fought with Pedro de Castro. The battalions of infantry had now driven home the pikes, and had penetrated their several quarries with the iron points until they reached the entrails. All were now turning back. Night showed signs of approach while yet the strife of battle was at its highest pitch; and at last, both sides being worn out with fatigue, they separated for a moment to gather breath for a renewal of the conflict. In the part where the captain Alonso de Alvarado was fighting, were Diego de Hoces and Saucedo with all the leading men of the Chile party. Some of these they killed, and whilst shouting \"Victory!\" they tried to capture others. Pedro de Vergara, with some infantry, bore a hand in that part, and Alonso de Alvarado being thus strengthened, ordered a renewed attack to disable the men of Chile, seeing how few there were. Against the grain they fell back for a short rest, still face to face, and then renewed the obstinate contest. Swords clashed down on helmets, stunning their wearers, and cut through coats of mail: then, pausing for a short space, apart, men glared at each other like bulls in the rutting season. Then the Sergeant-Major Francisco de Caravajal called out, in a loud voice: \"Shame! shame! gentlemen of Cuzco! this is not a time for letting these traitors remain in the field against us,\" and so saying he rushed into the midst of the enemy. The horse of the licentiate Benito Suárez de Caravajal was killed, and he boldly took his place among the infantry, still fighting. There were many killed; and the wounded uttered mournful groans, yet encouraging those who fought, some with the battle cry of Almagro, others of Pizarro. The artillery was of no use and did no damage, because Pedro de Candía and his men being killed, there was no one to put a match to the guns. \\n\\n \\n\\n [281] \\n\\n \\n\\n As the battle was most fiercely contested in the part where Captain Alvarado was, Don Diego, either to encourage his men, or because he thought that his side was winning, began to call out loudly, \"Victory! Take prisoners, but kill not!\" Then it was that a thing happened from which it may well be said that death does not flee from a coward. The captain Pedro Anzures had a servant of whom he asked, many times, if he would not join in the battle. The man was not only unwilling, but, to be more remote from danger, he got under some rocks where he could have a clear view of what was going on, having by his side a small skin of wine. When the artillery was in action a shot struck the rocks where we have said this man was. It knocked off a boulder which fell and smashed the head and body of the man to pieces, so that he died, although he had been taking such care of himself. \\n\\n \\n\\n The battle was at the critical point, and those who were standing with Vaca de Castro went forward to reinforce their friends. They went towards the place where the captain Diego Méndez was, thinking he was one of their party because victory was already certain for Vaca de Castro. As they went along singing a song of triumph, the men of Chile saw they were enemies, and they killed Montalvo with some others, cut off an arm of Cristóval de Burgos, a citizen of Lima, and wounded Merlo in the face. Thus they succeeded in doing more damage; but the Pachacama party, being the more numerous, though not surpassing their opponents in bravery, it began to be seen which side must win. Don Diego, and those of his captains who were still alive, continued to encourage the survivors wherever they went. The sun had now set, and after the men of Chile had done all that was possible to the utmost of their ability, they were defeated, and it became clear that Vaca de Castro\u0027s side were the conquerors. \\n\\n \\n\\n A youth, named Jerónimo de Almagro, valuing his life[282] very little, and hating to be conquered, rushed in amongst the enemy shouting, \"Hi! strike your blows at me! at me! and wreak your vengeance. \u0027Twas I who slew the Marquis.\" Saying thus he charged recklessly into the host, and received so many blows that he fell dead headlong. Martín de Bilbao did the same, saying that he had murdered the Marquis; and he met the same death as Jerónimo de Almagro.[134] Those who survived began to flee, with loose rein and no little anguish. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Indians and negroes who took any men alive, killed them.[135] The Spaniards did uglier things, for they slashed the faces and bodies of those who had surrendered, and reviled them with words. Diego de Almagro fled towards Cuzco[136] with Diego Méndez, and the camp was pillaged. The Almagro party was routed and broken up for ever. This battle was fought late on Saturday afternoon the 16th of September, in the year of our redemption 1542. \\n\\n \\n\\n There were present on the side of Vaca de Castro the captains already named and many other gentlemen, among whom were: Lorenzo de Aldana, Diego de Agüero, Francisco de Godoy, Pedro de los Ríos, Gómez de Tordoya, Diego Maldonado, Lope de Mendieta, D. Pedro Puertocarrero, Pedro de Portugal, Pedro de Hinojosa, D. Alonso[283] de Montemayor, Lope Martín, Alonso de Mendoza, Diego Cénteno, Felipe Gutiérrez, D. Martín de Guzmán, Pero López (secretary), Juan de Mora, Vasco de Guevara, and others. With Don Diego there were the captains, and many valiant gentlemen and men, among whom were D. Baltasar de Castilla, Jerónimo de Almagro, Martín Carillo, Juan Tello, Juan Ortíz de Zárate, Pantoja, Juan de la Rinega, Pedro de O?ate, and others. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Licentiate Vaca de Castro was delighted at the good success and the victory that God had given him. He ordered certain priests and friars to attend on the wounded and to confess the dying. He also directed a very careful search to be made for those who were concerned in the murder of the Marquis Pizarro, that they might be punished. But as the night was already quite dark, the orders of Vaca de Castro could not be very completely carried into effect. Most of his soldiers thought of nothing but plunder, and of appropriating horses from among those that were straying about loose, and also of the Indian girls, who were what the soldiers were most eager about in those times. \\n\\n \\n\\n Other Officers in the army of Vaca de Castro at the battle of Chupas.
