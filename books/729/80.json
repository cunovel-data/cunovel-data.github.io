{"id":23708,"no":80,"title":"CHAPTER LXXIX","content":"How, after the battle, the Governor ordered the wounded to be tended, and had Gómez de Tordoya carried to Guamanga; how retribution was inflicted on the conquered, and how Gómez de Alvarado, being ill, died at Vilcas, and was taken to be buried at Guamanga. ON the night after the battle it was very sad to hear the groans of the wounded, and the complaints they gave utterance to. But they received very little pity or help; on the contrary, the barbarians slaughtered them and stripped them of their clothes and left them naked. The captain Gómez de Alvarado was attacked by an illness of which he died at Vilcas. His body was conveyed to Guamanga for interment. They had also taken Gómez de Tordoya to Guamanga, sorely wounded, and after he had received the last offices of the Church he also died. Every one mourned for the deaths of these gentlemen and of Pero Alvarez Holguin, and the others who fell in the battle. They were very honourably interred, as men of such mettle deserved.[137] There were killed on the field in[285] that battle, counting both sides, 240 men. Some make the number higher, but I do not care to affirm anything that I do not know for certain. On the morning after the battle, Vaca de Castro, taking with him his secretary and the chief magistrate of the camp, visited the tents to see whether there were any of the murderers of the Marquis Pizarro among the prisoners. As he did not see Martín Carrillo, but heard that the captain Alonso de Cáceres was keeping him concealed, giving out that he was dead, he ordered that he should be brought to his presence dead or alive, and this was done. Carrillo was a native of Ciudad Real. He and Pedro de San Millán of Segovia, and Francisco Coronado[138] of Jerez by Bádajoz, and two others, were executed, and their quarters stuck on poles. Knowing that many fugitives had made for Guamanga, Vaca de Castro ordered the captain Diego de Rojas to take some mounted men and return to that city and arrest all who might be found there belonging to the enemy. While this was being arranged there was an alarm in the camp, owing to a report that a large body of men was in sight, who might be enemies. The Governor ordered the troops to stand to their arms until it was known to whom the men who were in sight belonged. Some horsemen rode out and found that they were their own people returning with plunder they had taken from the enemy\u0027s camp. Then Vaca de Castro ordered a start to be made for Guamanga, which was done, and on arrival he was received[286] with much joy. He entrusted the business of retributive justice to the licentiate De la Gama, the licentiate León, and the bachelor Guevara. Diego de Rojas had already executed judgment on some,[139] but we will put down here together in one list all who were executed at Guamanga as well as those who met their fate between that city and Cuzco. They were— Captain Cárdenas, of Toledo Pedro de O?ate Captain Diego de Hoces,[140] of Zaragoza Capt. Juan Tello, of Sevilla Bartolomé de Arbolancha[140] Francisco Pérez[140] Antonio Noguero, of Puerto de Sta María Basilio (an Italian) Martel, of Sevilla[140] Francisco de Mendibar, of Torrejón de Velasco Captain Martín Cote (a Guipuzcoan) Captain Juan Mu?oz Barragán (the younger),[140] of los Santos Martín Carrillo[140] Juanes de Santiago, of Santander Juanes (a Biscayan) Captain Juan Pérez, captain of cross-bowmen Juan Gómez de Salvatierra, of the Almendral Baltasar Gómez,[140] of Valladolid Juan de Guzmán[140] de Acu?a, son of Vasco de Guzmán Juan Sánchez,[140] of Estremadura Bartolomé Cabezas,[140] of Jerez Ramírez, of León Losa,[140] of Zamora Carre?o, of Sevilla Juan Diente,[140] of Gibraltar[141] Vaca de Castro was guilty of great remissness in not sending the news forthwith to the King our Lord and those of his Royal Council. Nay rather, several vessels were detained many days in the port of Lima, and many merchants and traders were put to serious loss through his[287] action in not allowing them to leave the ports where they were anchored. The captain Francisco de Herencia and some others were banished, and a shipmaster was ordered to convey them to New Spain. When they were far from the coast of Peru they mutinied and went to Panamá. At that time I had come thither to negotiate certain business with the Audience which then sat at that city. The mutineers presented themselves before the members of the Audience, who set them free. To return to Vaca de Castro. He remained for eight days in Guamanga, reforming various things for the good of the Realm, and despatching letters to the various cities in it to announce the victory that God, our Lord, had given him. Hearing that Don Diego had fled towards Cuzco, he ordered the captain Garcilaso de la Vega to set out at once for that city, with some cavalry, and occupy it in the name of his Majesty the King, our Lord. Should Don Diego be found in the city, he was to be arrested, as well as any of his followers who were there. So Garcilaso de la Vega departed, with some lancers, to carry out what the Governor Vaca de Castro had ordered him.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971/56501.html","bookId":729,"book":{"id":729,"title":"The War of Chupas","description":"简介： Pedro de Cieza de Len was, on the whole, the most important historian, and is now the best authority, on ancient Peru, so far as his work has reached us; for he was a great traveller, and an eye-witness of much that he described....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM"}}
