{"id":23688,"no":60,"title":"CHAPTER LIX","content":"How the Governor Vaca de Castro held a review of the Spaniards who were with him, and how he sent the captain Lorenzo de Aldana, and also Diego Maldonado, to the camp of Pero Alvarez. \n \n AS the Governor had arrived so near to Guaraz, where the Captain-General Pero Alvarez Holguin was encamped, many came from thence to see him and offer their services for the king, some remaining and others returning. And as in these parts of the Indies there is much craft, and men put so little faith in each other, it was not long before they began to sow discord between the Governor and Pero Alvarez: in this way. To Vaca de Castro they said that Pero Alvarez was suspicious, and that it was his intention, if he were not retained in the rank of General, not to furnish the troops he had raised, nor acknowledge Vaca de Castro as Governor. To Pero Alvarez they said that, owing to what Gómez de Tordoya and Garcilaso de la Vega had said to Vaca de Castro, he and others who had come from his camp showed no inclination to recognize the great service Pero Alvarez had rendered to his Majesty, and advised him not to hand over the banners. While these things that we are relating were going on Vaca de Castro consulted with the Provincial about what they told him. His intention was not to leave the command with Pero Alvarez as General, for it would not be proper that he himself, as Governor for the king, and having to be on the battle-field in person, should share the title of General with any other officer if the enemy attacked them. He also intended to bestow the position of Camp-master on Lorenzo de Aldana. The Provincial gave him his opinion as to what would be best for his Majesty\u0027s[200] service, and advised the Governor to send some trustworthy persons to explain matters privately to Pero Alvarez and persuade him to conform. \n \n The advice of the Provincial appeared to Vaca de Castro to be good, and, seeing that Lorenzo de Aldana, who was an intimate friend and relative of Pero Alvarez, was there, he arranged to send him to speak with Pero Alvarez on his behalf. He was to say that the Governor had the greatest pleasure in recognizing all the service that Pero Alvarez had done his Majesty, but he was to persuade him to deliver the banners to Vaca de Castro, because, the Marquis being deceased, he was now the Governor of the Realm by commission from his Majesty as Pero Alvarez was already aware. As to what had been heard of him, that he desired to retain the command, the Governor would promise that, after himself, no one who was with him or elsewhere in the Realm should have precedence of Pero Alvarez in honour, nor rank above him in the camp. And since Aldana had always been such a loyal servant of his Majesty, and was such a close friend and relative of Pero Alvarez, it was to be expected that he would put his hand to this business in such a way that the king\u0027s service would not suffer in any respect. The Governor moreover wished that Diego Maldonado, a citizen of Cuzco, should go with Aldana, as he was a person of importance and well known to all. Lorenzo de Aldana replied cheerfully, expressing a confident hope that the king would be well served by the mission of Diego Maldonado and himself, inasmuch as there could be no reasonable doubt of the loyalty of Pero Alvarez. So they presently set out and arrived at Guaraz in a few days. After having been handsomely welcomed some discussions took place between the parties. Aldana and Maldonado explained to Pero Alvarez the suspicions that had been raised against him, and said that having done such splendid service to[201] the king\u0027s cause he should not tarnish it by not conforming to the Governor\u0027s plans. In the end they persuaded him to act with all friendship and loyalty, assuring him that Vaca de Castro would look upon him as the second person in all the camp, and would give him the position of Camp-master. So Pero Alvarez delivered the banners to be given to Vaca de Castro and wrote him a polite letter; and the same was done by the other captains and cavaliers who were there with him. \n \n Meanwhile the Governor Vaca de Castro had set out from where he had halted and was approaching the place where Alonso de Alvarado\u0027s camp was pitched, on learning which that officer prepared to receive him in the most honourable way possible, with many festoons of sedges and sweet-smelling flowers round about the tent. As the Governor approached, Alvarado and his officers mounted their steeds and rode out to meet him, in their armour, while the footmen came with pikes, cross-bows, and arquebuses, in squadron formation and in fine order, as if ready to fight, that the Governor might see how dexterous they were in military drill. When Alonso de Alvarado came to the Governor, he dismounted to make obeisance, and Vaca de Castro received him very well, commending him for the great service he had done to his Majesty in raising the banner in his royal name, and for the honour he had acquired in having been the first to declare against the party of the men of Chile. Alvarado replied that he had done what he would never cease to do, which was to serve the king. Presently Gómez de Alvarado and the other gentlemen and soldiers composing the cavalry and the squadron came up to kiss hands, and the Governor embraced them all affectionately and gave them sure hopes that they would be rewarded for what they had done in his Majesty\u0027s interests. After saying this and other things they all remounted and went into the camp, where[202] Vaca de Castro was lodged in quarters that had been prepared for him. He was so happy and contented at seeing himself in command of the troops assembled there, and at finding that Alonso de Alvarado was loyal to him, that he could not conceal his pleasure. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971/56481.html","bookId":729,"book":{"id":729,"title":"The War of Chupas","description":"简介： Pedro de Cieza de Len was, on the whole, the most important historian, and is now the best authority, on ancient Peru, so far as his work has reached us; for he was a great traveller, and an eye-witness of much that he described....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM"}}
