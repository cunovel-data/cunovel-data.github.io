{"id":23683,"no":55,"title":"CHAPTER LIV","content":"How, after he had despatched messengers to many parts, the Governor Vaca de Castro resolved to leave Quito and go to join the captain Alonso de Alvarado. \\n\\n \\n\\n IT has been related how letters from Alonso de Alvarado were given to Vaca de Castro at Carangue, informing him that he, Alvarado, had ranged himself on the side of the King, against the Chile party, and of other matters, and how Vaca de Castro received the news with great satisfaction and sent messengers to the Bracamoros and other parts, calling upon the people to join him in procuring punishment of Don Diego for having murdered the Marquis and usurped the government. When it was known in the coast towns that Vaca de Castro was at Quito several came to join him and, with those brought by himself and by Belalcázar, they made up the force there assembled to 120 men. And as he got word that Pedro de Vergara was coming very willingly to join, with all the Spaniards he had with him, Vaca de Castro determined, since his affairs were having so good a beginning, to set out from Quito; leaving Hernando Sarmiento there as his Lieutenant-Governor. But he first ordered the Adelantado[183] Belalcázar to go on ahead with twenty horsemen and scour the country; for having subdued the natives of that region himself, he was so well known to them, that he could ensure a supply of provisions at all the halting places along the route they would take. Belalcázar said that he would do as he was ordered, and leaving Quito by the royal road, he called at Pansaleo and La Tacunga, and went on until he came to the royal lodgments at Tomebamba. Here he met the captain Diego de Mora, and one Barrientos and others who, with a desire to serve the King, were coming to join Vaca de Castro. Among them came the captain Francisco Nú?ez, the same who was banished from Lima when they put Francisco de Chaves to death. To escape being punished for having been present at the murder of the Marquis, he pretended that he had come to join Vaca de Castro, and when he knew that the Adelantado Belalcázar was there, he spoke to him requesting that he would so far favour him as to see that he was not hardly dealt with. Although Belalcázar knew that he was one of the most culpable in the murder of the old Marquis, and that Vaca de Castro was anxious to capture the authors of that misdeed, and to inflict punishment commensurate with the greatness of the crime they had committed, he was not only content to let him escape, but, that he might get away without being seen by Vaca de Castro, he gave him a horse, telling him to ride until he was within his (Belalcázar\u0027s) government, where he would have nothing to fear. \\n\\n \\n\\n When Vaca de Castro knew that Diego de Mora and the others were coming to join him, he rejoiced greatly and advanced as far as Tomebamba, still accompanied by Aldana, Maldonado, Valdivieso, and other friends; while to those he found at Tomebamba he showed great regard, and spoke very gratefully. But when he learnt that Belalcázar, without his knowledge or consent, had lent a friendly[184] hand to Francisco Nú?ez de Pedroso, he resented it deeply, and sending for Belalcázar immediately, rebuked him with some asperity; and from that time forth he did not trust the Adelantado as before. He wrote at once to Sarmiento, his lieutenant at Quito, urging him to use diligence in finding out by what road the captain Francisco Nú?ez had travelled, and to arrest him, that he might be punished. But although Sarmiento did his best, he was unable to catch the fugitive, because the guide given him by Belalcázar well knew how to elude pursuit and get within the Adelantado\u0027s government, where Nú?ez joined the captain Juan Cabrera, and they went together to Antioquía. \\n\\n \\n\\n At this royal seat of Tomebamba they told the Governor Vaca de Castro certain things which I will not affirm to be positively true, because I have not met with an informant who states that he heard them himself, and also because Belalcázar was a friend of the Pachacama party, and had been one of the Marquis\u0027 captains. What they alleged was that he said he approved of the murder of the Marquis, that Don Diego had done well in killing him to avenge the death of his father, and that he showed himself a friend of Don Diego; besides other things which were not proper to be said at such a time. When Vaca de Castro was made aware of this, he was very seriously annoyed, and regretted that he had brought Belalcázar with him. He would have ordered him to return, had he not feared that many of those who had come with him would not themselves care to remain on seeing him go back. The anger and worry he felt on learning that Belalcázar had said such things brought on a fever, of which Vaca de Castro became ill. He said nothing to Belalcázar then, but continued his journey to San Miguel, people joining him day by day from all parts to serve his Majesty. He reached the city of Piura and, after having been welcomed as Governor, he departed, having a strong[185] desire the while to find some pretext for dismissing Belalcázar. Presently they arrived at the village of Carrochamba, where Vaca de Castro found the children of the Marquis who, since they heard of his coming, had been waiting for him there, as well as the widow of Francisco Martín de Alcántara. Vaca de Castro went to visit them before he entered his own lodging, and consoled them by saying that now that it had pleased God that the Marquis should be slain, they need not be anxious, for he would punish the authors of the deed, and the heirs should be restored to their estates. \\n\\n \\n\\n After Vaca de Castro had been four or five days in Carrochamba, certain arquebusiers arrived, who had been sent by the captain Vergara; for when Sandoval and all those who were with him arrived, Vergara determined to set out to serve his Majesty. To avoid any difficulty about provisions, he would not come to where Vaca de Castro then was, but awaited him farther on, though in the meanwhile he sent the arquebusiers as a bodyguard for the Governor. The Governor was pleased at their arrival. Before this he had directed one Carre?o by name, a very swift runner, to go to Lima dressed as an Indian, with a copy of his commission, in order that he should be acknowledged as Governor. This Carre?o bound himself to perform, and he went with the despatch and letters to Lima, arriving there at a time when Don Diego was very near the city, so he smuggled himself into the monastery of Santo Domingo. When the Provincial, Friar San Martín, learnt the contents of the documents he was much relieved and told the news to the aldermen, who thereupon assembled in the church, where they agreed to accept Jerónimo de Aliaga as lieutenant, though it is said that they at first chose Francisco de Barrionuevo. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971/56476.html","bookId":729,"book":{"id":729,"title":"The War of Chupas","description":"简介： Pedro de Cieza de Len was, on the whole, the most important historian, and is now the best authority, on ancient Peru, so far as his work has reached us; for he was a great traveller, and an eye-witness of much that he described....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM"}}
