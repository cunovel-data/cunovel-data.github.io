{"id":23696,"no":68,"title":"CHAPTER LXVII","content":"In which the preceding chapter is concluded, down to the death of García de Alvarado. \\n\\n \\n\\n WITH the passing of the events we have narrated, there did not cease to be deep mistrust between the one party and the other. Some soldiers insisted to García de Alvarado that he should kill Don Diego, and march with the remains of his army against Vaca de Castro, wherever he might appear, for they did not deem it safe to trust Don Diego any longer, nor others who had shown themselves to be their enemies. Alvarado, who was very inconstant, but a bold youth to boot, did not hesitate about doing what his friends advised, or killing Don Diego. At this time there was, in Juan Balsa\u0027s troop, a cavalier named San Millán,[107] a native of Segovia belonging to the family of the Bocudos, very rich merchants. He had been one of the conquistadores in various parts of this Realm, and was present at the murder of the Marquis. He was very liberal and a great spendthrift, having lavished upwards of 80,000 pesos de oro upon the soldiers in camp. When García de Alvarado was nominated General, San Millán wished to offer him his friendship and service; and as San Millán was prodigal of his means, he pressed Alvarado, after having made him many offers, to accept the hospitality of[227] his house and friends, at a social reception he wished to give him. García de Alvarado, knowing that San Millán\u0027s words to him were spoken with good intention, without any afterthought or admixture of malice, thanked him for the invitation, and replied that he would be happy to do what San Millán had asked of him, especially as they might bring together at the reception or banquet many who were disaffected towards each other, and so promote friendship among all; and he told San Millán that he might get ready for any day he wished, as he would like to invite Don Diego. They say that, after this, García de Alvarado conferred with his friends about murdering Diego Méndez,[108] Alonso de Sayavedra, Diego de Hoces,[108] Juan Gutiérrez Malaver,[109] and other captains and soldiers who were deemed to have been friends of Sotelo. They even resolved to kill Don Diego de Almagro himself, and after these murders, to send messengers to Vaca de Castro, offering to deliver up the camp and render him obedience, upon which Alvarado was to be made captain, so that he might go forth to explore some remote and unknown portions of these Realms. After having formed this conspiracy, its authors and conspirants, who were not few, set about preparing to carry it out, and García de Alvarado, when he had arranged it, went to Don Diego and announced that San Millán wished to give an entertainment and had invited him. He begged that Don Diego would be present and allow the captains to come too, as it was right that all should enjoy themselves. \\n\\n \\n\\n Don Diego quite understood that García de Alvarado did not say this in good faith or of his own choice exactly; but as it seemed that this might open a way in which to get Alvarado killed, he accepted the invitation courteously, and observed that he thought it would be good for them to[228] have some diversion and enjoy themselves. This being arranged, García de Alvarado took his leave, and returned home to complete his arrangements, while San Millán went about collecting all manner of things for the banquet, buying wine at 300 pesos the arroba, for the guests to drink. Don Diego conferred with his friends, and those he most trusted, and concerted plans for them to be prepared to take García de Alvarado\u0027s life at this reception that he wanted to take place. Juan Balsa, Diego de Hoces,[109] and Juan Gutiérrez Malaver, Diego Méndez and others, agreed to comply with the mandate in this affair and leagued themselves against Alvarado. Being all imbued with this good purpose, the afternoon arrived. Don Diego had retired to his chamber a little after vespers, and with him those who were to kill García de Alvarado. Stretched on his bed Don Diego pretended to be ill, in order that Alvarado should come and want to take him to the reception or supper, for all had dined already and there was to be a second repast, at which each party expected to achieve its deed. Don Diego ordered Martín Cote[110] to take the guard that night, and see that the soldiers were well supplied with bullets, for what might happen. Martín Cote sent his ensign with fifty arquebusiers to carry out the orders given by Don Diego. When they arrived at the gate of Don Diego\u0027s house they were secretly ordered to fire the salute without bullets, but at the second round to fire with bullets and to be in readiness to obey further orders. By this time the supper was ready, and García de Alvarado sent a request, couched in submissive terms, that Don Diego would come to it, intending to put into practice what had been preconcerted. Don Diego, who was not rash where nothing less than his life was concerned, pretended of set purpose that his illness was worse, so that[229] García de Alvarado should come to him and there would be a chance to kill him. When the messenger came, Don Diego answered—\"Tell the Captain-General that I am feeling so unwell that I do not want any supper; but that out of regard for him I will go presently to where he wishes me to be present.\" On the messenger\u0027s return, it seemed to García de Alvarado that it would be bad manners not to go to Don Diego, since it was plain that he was unwell, and therefore, so that they should get him to where they wished without arousing suspicion, he said to those who were with him—\"Hi! Gentlemen, let us go to the Governor, for they tell me he is not well.\" Thereupon he left his house and went to where the entertainment was to be, with many men well armed, and shielded by every precaution. He himself wore his sword and a short coat of mail, thick and of a fine mesh. On the way he met Martín Carrillo, a fast friend of his and an enemy to Don Diego. Learning whither Alvarado was going, Carrillo urged him to go back, for that, if he went on, he was lost, and if Don Diego should find him in his house it would certainly be his death. \\n\\n \\n\\n García de Alvarado, with his usual audacity, turned and said \"Who is man enough to kill me? Let us go. Don\u0027t you be afraid; for I am not.\" Martín Carrillo, divining the just death that awaited Alvarado, again warned him not to go, declaring that he would never return from thence. Alvarado, not heeding these remonstrances, arrived before the entrance to Xapana, which was where Don Diego had his quarters. On seeing so many arquebusiers he was troubled. They gave him the salute without bullets, which reassured him, and he passed and entered the house. He had no sooner gone in than the arquebusiers reloaded with bullets. He entered through the sala accompanied by all his friends, and went on to the room where Don Diego was. The captain of the guard, Juan de Guzmán,[230] stood at the door. Alvarado pushed abruptly into the room, asking where was the Governor. As soon as he was inside, with three or four of his friends, the captain Juan de Guzmán shut the door and secured it well with a halberd, to prevent the others who had come with him from entering. Don Diego was much elated that Alvarado had come to him. He got off the bed where he was reclining, and called out to those who were with him, \"Hi! Gentlemen, let us go to supper.\" García de Alvarado said, \"What has been your lordship\u0027s illness? I am much troubled to hear that you have not been well.\" Don Diego answered that it was nothing now, and that they might well go to supper. As he said this, Juan Balsa as Lieutenant-general, stepped forward and threw himself upon García de Alvarado and closed with him saying, \"You are arrested in the King\u0027s name.\" Don Diego, drawing his sword, cried out, \"Arrested, no; but dead—yes!\" and so saying he gave Alvarado a bad wound on the head, while those who were present struck blows at him, and pierced his body with many wounds. He only exclaimed \"God protect me! where are my friends?\" Saying this he fell dead on the floor, and paid for what he did to Cristóbal de Sotelo. His friends, when they knew what had occurred, were scared at such a strange proceeding, and went away, some in one direction and some in another, to hide in various buildings of the city. Don Diego desired nothing more than to punish García de Alvarado; and now that he had him dead the Governor pardoned all those who had figured as Alvarado\u0027s friends. Many came accordingly to kiss hands and to renew their offers of service to him. \\n\\n \\n\\n On the death of Alvarado there was great relief among the rest of the Almagro party, for owing to his arrogance and presumption all wished him ill. He ended by dying a death in conformity with the life he had led, and paid for his complicity in the murder of the Marquis,[231] the robberies and outrages he committed, and the death he inflicted on Sotelo—above all, for his treachery in wanting to gain renown, and obtain pardon at the expense of the youth Don Diego and the others. García de Alvarado was a cavalier aged twenty-nine years, of handsome mien and comely form, ambitious, proud, highly presumptuous, and very vain. He was very spirited and brave, but fond of low company, and prone to listen to their advice. They robbed his house, where he kept a deal of plate, and other articles of value. \\n\\n \\n\\n By this time the members of the Almagro party had fallen not far short of effacing each other, and their tyranny had almost triumphed over themselves, so that it seemed as if it had pleased God our Lord that the posthumous honours of the Marquis should be celebrated with the blood of the very men who were foremost in his murder, and in committing so great an atrocity as that of which they were guilty. Considering in my own mind the ill-starred deaths of Francisco de Chaves, Juan de Herrada, Cristóbal de Sotelo, and García de Alvarado, who were the principal leaders of the Almagro band, and the bad ends they all came to, I am astonished that the promoters of seditions and tyrannies which have arisen did not take warning from them, to estrange themselves from such a hateful and iniquitous thing as the usurpation of the kingdom from its natural Lord.[111] But the people in Peru do not know how to take warning from the example of others. Let us leave this, however, and say a little about the Governor Vaca de Castro. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971/56489.html","bookId":729,"book":{"id":729,"title":"The War of Chupas","description":"简介： Pedro de Cieza de Len was, on the whole, the most important historian, and is now the best authority, on ancient Peru, so far as his work has reached us; for he was a great traveller, and an eye-witness of much that he described....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM"}}
