{"id":23717,"no":89,"title":"CHAPTER LXXXVIII","content":"How the captain Gonzalo Pizarro arrived at the city of Cuzco, accompanied by some followers, but had not laid aside his rebellious design of occupying the Realm; and of what else happened. \n \n THE captain Gonzalo Pizarro travelled to Cuzco accompanied by a few comrades who had come out of the Canela country with him, and others who now joined him, who, by always talking of things of the past without considering the serious trouble that must overtake them in the future, incited him to no good purpose, but to a course which might do much harm. This is the great sorrow I feel—that many princes and great lords, if vain words had not been poured into their ears by the voices of youths and flatterers, would not have involved themselves and their neighbours in so many calamities and disasters. It has been the same in these Indies, where the men living in them are alike astute and malicious, as well as so much addicted to uproars that the governors and captains who wish to live peaceably get no chance of doing so. Some to avenge themselves on others, some to obtain commands and dignities, some to secure favours and riches, incite the poorer sort to live at enmity with their equals. They rise for certain objects, and, forced by necessity, have to carry their opinions forward, while those who thus commit them slip out of the mess when they see a time for it. So it was with the ill-fated captain Gonzalo Pizarro who, besides being ambitious to command, was so stirred up by his followers that, after having served his Majesty loyally and well, he entered upon bad and ugly courses,[149] as we are[312] told on a stone memorial which is set up in the city of Cuzco, forever branding him as a traitor. \n \n When Gonzalo Pizarro had arrived within a short distance of Cuzco, his companions urged that, having been acknowledged as Governor at Quito on the strength of his appointment and nomination by his brother, he ought now to be Governor of the whole kingdom just as his brother the Marquis was before his death. Should he not take this step, they said, he would be looked upon by all as a weak man wanting in resolution, and he would be held in poor esteem for not daring to take what was rightfully his. With this specious talk matters reached such a pass that he came to an understanding with them, and they with him, to kill Vaca de Castro and seize the Realm: at least so it is said. Villalba was present amidst these intrigues, but disapproved of their upshot and pressed on in advance to Cuzco, where he warned Vaca de Castro of what was in the wind. The Governor, when he was told about it, gave orders to the guard to be very watchful; and, on collecting as many more as he was able to, he found himself with 400 men. The principal captains were acting in concert, and agreed that if, when Gonzalo Pizarro should come, he did anything that was not lawful nor proper for the King\u0027s service, they would cut off his head. By that time Gonzalo Pizarro had arrived close to the city and, as there is never any lack of some one to give information, letters were sent along to meet him, advising him to be careful of his person, because Vaca de Castro intended to kill him. When he knew this Gonzalo Pizarro spoke to Juan de Acosta and others, warning them to be ready to kill Vaca de Castro when they would meet, and that he himself would give the signal. When Gonzalo reached the city, some persons came out to receive him. It was now publicly known that Villalba had disclosed the plot, so Gonzalo Pizarro declared with an oath that he had no such thought,[313] and that Villalba had spoken lies. Villalba maintained what he had said, and retorted by declaring the names of those concerned in it. As they now saw and understood that they were found out, some of them fled, but Vaca de Castro ordered them to be searched for and, if discovered, to be put to death. \n \n When Gonzalo Pizarro came to the street where the Governor\u0027s house was situated, there were numerous arquebusiers posted along the walls, and a bodyguard within. Martín de Guzmán was at the door, with orders not to let anyone enter except Gonzalo Pizarro himself, and this was obeyed. Vaca de Castro received him very well, and conversed with him on his expedition into the Canela country, and the great hardships he had endured. After he had advised Pizarro to now give himself rest, the latter took leave of him. But the men around Pizarro did not discontinue their intrigues. They told Gonzalo Pizarro that Vaca de Castro wanted to kill him while others told Vaca de Castro that Pizarro wanted to kill him and seize upon the government. Then Vaca de Castro sent for Gonzalo Pizarro and, by a writ under the hand of the secretary Pero López, required him to proceed to Charcas, where he had estates, and to stay there, without maintaining any body of men which might give rise to a renewal of the scandal, on pain of being declared a traitor and forfeiting all his property. He was to live there as a private person. \n \n They say that, after this, Gonzalo Pizarro continued to entertain damaging intentions against the Governor, and that one day, when Vaca de Castro was out with his guards, Pizarro came up to speak to him. The arquebusiers, seeing him approach, stepped forward to intercept him; but on observing this Vaca de Castro said, \"Stay where you are, for where Don Gonzalo Pizarro is, I deem myself safe and need no other guard.\" When Pizarro heard these confident words he abandoned the design he had been nursing,[314] and set out, accompanied only by his servants, for the town of Plata, where he had Indians who yielded more income than is possessed in Spain by the Archbishop of Toledo and the Count of Benavente. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971/56510.html","bookId":729,"book":{"id":729,"title":"The War of Chupas","description":"简介： Pedro de Cieza de Len was, on the whole, the most important historian, and is now the best authority, on ancient Peru, so far as his work has reached us; for he was a great traveller, and an eye-witness of much that he described....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM"}}
