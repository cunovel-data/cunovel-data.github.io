{"id":23698,"no":70,"title":"CHAPTER LXIX","content":"Of what Vaca de Castro did in Lima, of the arrival of the captains at Jauja, and how Pedro Anzures went to San Miguel. AFTER the Governor Vaca de Castro arrived in Lima, and was welcomed and acknowledged as related in the preceding chapter, he was informed by the factor Illán Suárez, his brother the licentiate, and Francisco de Godoy, of all the events that had happened there. He put before them and the other officials and magistrates how the captains Alonso de Alvarado and Pero Alvarez Holguin had collected a brilliant array of troops, all desirous of serving His Majesty, and determined not to rest until the tyranny of Don Diego should be put down. He found in them all a true and earnest readiness to do the same. In Lima he also found Gómez de Alvarado,[113] brother of the Adelantado Don Pedro, with whom he was much pleased. Exertions were made to raise money, and to collect men[236] to augment his force. They were called up at the sound of the drum, and when they had all been mustered, Gómez de Alvarado was made captain of the mounted men, and Juan Vélez de Guevara of those on foot. At this time Alonso de Alvarado and Pero Alvarez, with Garcilaso and the rest, had gone forward from Guaraz and marched by stages until they arrived in the province of Jauja, where they found Diego de Rojas. They ordered him to advance to the city of Guamanga[114] and make a fort there, where he was to wait until the rest of the division should arrive, pending the receipt of news of what Don Diego was doing, and whether he had departed from Cuzco. The camp was pitched in Jauja, and the captains and men-at-arms were well supplied by the Guancas, natives of that valley. Vaca de Castro was at Lima procuring necessaries, where the captain Juan de Sayavedra, the licentiate Benito Suárez de Caravajal, the captains Diego de Agüero and Francisco de Godoy, with the secretary Jerónimo de Aliaga, had attached themselves to him, whilst Montenegro and other inhabitants of Lima offered to go with him. Diego Gavilán the conquistador,[115] a native of Guadalcanal, did the same, and they prepared to leave Lima. The captain Pedro Anzures made such good speed that he soon reached the city of San Miguel, and arrested Diego de Santiago, from whom he took 18,000 pesos de oro. With this he proceeded to Lima, and was welcomed by the Governor. The money brought by Anzures supplied pay and outfits for the soldiers. In the port of Callao there lay anchored the great galleon, with four other ships. Not knowing what might be the result of the war, Vaca de Castro thought it well to hold the sea secure, so as to be able to escape by it if they should find them[237]selves closely pressed. After having taken the advice of the senior persons there he appointed Juan Pérez de Guevara, the same who had gone to settle Moyobamba, to command the ships. He promised that he would do what he was ordered, in all loyalty. When Vaca de Castro had put things in order at Lima, he set out on his journey, and travelled until he arrived in the valley of Jauja, where he was welcomed by the captains. Diego de Rojas had marched as far as Guamanga, and ascertained from the Indians that Don Diego was still at Cuzco, where all the inhabitants were favouring the King\u0027s service. Vaca de Castro now thought it well to set out from Jauja, and they made preparations, when a thing happened which presently bid fair to cause much harm. It arose about certain Indians who were wanted to carry loads for the company of Alonso de Alvarado, but whom Pero Alvarez, in his capacity as Camp-master, would not supply. Alvarado was so angry that he sent Pero Alvarez a challenge. When Pero Alvarez received it he became exceedingly enraged, and was about to meet his adversary when Vaca de Castro heard of it. In a great hurry, before the friends of either could take sides, he sent for Alonso de Alvarado, and ordering him not to go from where he was, the Governor began to expostulate with him. He appealed to him as the oldest captain, and one who had always served the king, not to show enmity for so slight a cause and in such difficult times towards Pero Alvarez, nor any other captain. Having said these things, Vaca de Castro then ordered his secretary Pero López to go to Pero Alvarez and ask him for the letter containing the challenge. Pero Alvarez answered that he did not treat such things seriously, and that he had already torn up the letter. The Governor then directed Pero López, Lorenzo de Aldana, and Francisco de Godoy to go and get the letter; and Pero Alvarez sent the torn pieces to Vaca de Castro.[238] Francisco de Godoy, Lorenzo de Aldana, Garcilaso de la Vega and other gentlemen then intervening, Alonso de Alvarado and Pero Alvarez were induced to make friends, and they remained on good terms as before. Vaca de Castro recompensed the native dwellers in Jauja for the supplies they had given, and distributed the new pikes among the soldiers; and they prepared to leave Jauja at once.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971/56491.html","bookId":729,"book":{"id":729,"title":"The War of Chupas","description":"简介： Pedro de Cieza de Len was, on the whole, the most important historian, and is now the best authority, on ancient Peru, so far as his work has reached us; for he was a great traveller, and an eye-witness of much that he described....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM"}}
