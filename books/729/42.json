{"id":23670,"no":42,"title":"CHAPTER XLI","content":"How the President Cristóbal Vaca de Castro left the city of Cali for that of Popayán, and how he there heard of the death of the Marquis, from Lorenzo de Aldana who came in search of him. AS soon as Vaca de Castro had recovered sufficiently to be able to travel, he was desirous of continuing his journey to Lima, where he expected to find the Marquis and make arrangements for carrying out his Majesty\u0027s instructions. He, therefore, spoke to the Adelantado Don Sebastián de Belalcázar saying that he wished to set out for Popayán, and asking that the necessary things might be provided by the way. Belalcázar complied with this request, and the Licentiate Vaca de Castro set out for the city of Popayán, which is twenty-two leagues from Cali, accompanied by his staff. On his arrival there he was made very welcome by the inhabitants and municipal authorities. At the time when the Marquis was killed, Lorenzo de Aldana was at Quito, and the news was not long in reaching that city, as news will fly. Nevertheless Aldana had already set out to join Vaca de Castro. For there had been a delay of four months between the Judge\u0027s landing at Buenaventura and his arrival at Popayán, so that the news of his arrival reached Quito before that of the death of the Marquis. But the latter news came to Quito very soon after Aldana\u0027s departure. One of Aldana\u0027s servants named Almaraz, who had charge of his Indians and estate, made great haste to overtake him, and brought[141] him word of it. When Aldana heard it he was deeply affected, and made still greater haste to reach the city of Popayán where Vaca de Castro then was. He arrived on a Sunday morning when the people had just gone to mass. He made his way into the church and at once reported himself to Vaca de Castro, who welcomed him, having been apprised of his good and meritorious services. But when Vaca de Castro heard that the Marquis was dead he could scarcely believe it true, yet he did not fail to consider that the Chile party, as conquered men who desired to avenge the death of their Adelantado, might have committed the murder. He was very glad that he carried a commission from his Majesty to govern the province and administer justice himself, in the event of the Marquis\u0027s death. Certainly he did not show much feeling on hearing of the event, although some believed this was his policy. On the same day he despatched messengers to the Adelantado Belalcázar, asking him not to go to Cartago or any where else, but to remain in the city until it was definitely known whether the news he had received of the death of the Marquis was true or false. Belalcázar replied that he would do what was ordered and not depart, however much it might seem desirable. We will now leave off writing of Vaca de Castro, and relate what was happening at Lima.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971/56455.html","bookId":729,"book":{"id":729,"title":"The War of Chupas","description":"简介： Pedro de Cieza de Len was, on the whole, the most important historian, and is now the best authority, on ancient Peru, so far as his work has reached us; for he was a great traveller, and an eye-witness of much that he described....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM"}}
