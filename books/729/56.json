{"id":23684,"no":56,"title":"CHAPTER LV","content":"Of what passed in the camp of Pero Alvarez Holguin, and how the Camp Master Gómez de Tordoya and the captain Garcilaso de la Vega set out from thence and went to meet the Governor Vaca de Castro. \n \n WE related, in previous chapters, how the General Pero Alvarez Holguin arrived in the province of Guaraz with his people, and how Gómez de Tordoya was Camp Master and second in command. When they got there and learnt for certain that Vaca de Castro was coming nearer to Quito they sent messengers to him, and also to Captain Alonso de Alvarado. Now Carre?o, who went with the Governor\u0027s commission to the city of Lima, had passed that way and spread the report that Vaca de Castro and all who were coming with him said publicly that the credit of all that had been done in Cuzco and the Charcas was due to Gómez de Tordoya, and to no other. Although Tordoya heard this, he was prudent and desirous to serve the King, so he did not pay any heed to it. Pero Alvarez felt differently, and appeared much annoyed on hearing of such gossip; and to excite him the more, his friends made trouble between him and Gómez de Tordoya by saying that the latter ought to be turned out of the camp and not be allowed in it, that it might be learnt and understood whether he was a party to the statement, or had given countenance to it, that it might work his own ends. Pero Alvarez inconsiderately sent Captain Castro to arrest Gómez de Tordoya, and this was done. Castro went one morning to the lodging of Gómez de Tordoya, with some soldiers, and carried out his orders, whereby Tordoya was caused great hardship. Without letting his intention be known Tordoya left Guaraz, armed and mounted, to go and[187] join Vaca de Castro. As the captain Garcilaso de la Vega was a first cousin of Tordoya,[98] and so highly esteemed by all present there, Pero Alvarez consented that he also should leave the camp. Garcilaso did so, giving the banner of his company to his ensign Pedro de Fuentes. The two knights having met together, took the road towards Truxillo, where they believed Vaca de Castro was. \n \n After they had gone, the General Pero Alvarez Holguin made an explanation in presence of the soldiers, in order that they might not blame him for his treatment of Tordoya. He also wrote a letter to the latter, inviting him very earnestly to come back, for that it was by the speeches of prejudiced men that he had been induced to act as he did, for which he now felt regret. Tordoya, when he had seen the letter, replied that he would go to meet Vaca de Castro, and he would be a good friend to him, and of that he might be assured. So he went on until he found Vaca de Castro. The captain Alonso de Alvarado came several times from his camp to that of Pero Alvarez to enjoy friendly intercourse with those who were there, and they remained more than four months collecting supplies in the neighbourhood whilst waiting for the arrival of the Governor Vaca de Castro, with a strong desire to start at once in search of their enemies. So we will quit speaking of them, and say a little about the Governor Vaca de Castro. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971/56477.html","bookId":729,"book":{"id":729,"title":"The War of Chupas","description":"简介： Pedro de Cieza de Len was, on the whole, the most important historian, and is now the best authority, on ancient Peru, so far as his work has reached us; for he was a great traveller, and an eye-witness of much that he described....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM"}}
