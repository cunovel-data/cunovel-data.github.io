{"id":23647,"no":19,"title":"CHAPTER XVIII","content":"How, after Gonzalo Pizarro was received as Governor of Quito, he determined to undertake the conquest of El Dorado; and of his departure from Quito. \\n\\n \\n\\n WE have already related, in a former chapter, how the Marquis Pizarro ordered the captain Gonzalo Pizarro, his brother, to depart for the city of Quito, where, by virtue of an authority from his Majesty, he would be received as Governor. In reality the authority was not to the effect that the Marquis could divide the government; still less did it empower him, if it should seem to him fit, to grant the whole to one of his brothers or to any one he chose. The aim of the Marquis was to establish his brother in that province, that his Majesty might not grant the government of it to Belalcázar, whose setting out by the Rio Grande was now known.[31] Although this was so, they say that the Marquis wrote to His Majesty that, if it were decided to divide the government, Belalcázar deserved whatever favour might be shown him. News also came to Lima that[55] Pascual de Andagoya was coming as Governor of the province of the river of San Juan. This caused the Marquis great annoyance, and he appointed one Isidro de Tapia to be his lieutenant at Cali, nay, also at Anzerma, in consequence, it is said, of heavy bribes given to the Secretary Antonio Picado. Although this was done, they would not accept him nor give up Robledo in his stead. \\n\\n \\n\\n To return to Gonzalo Pizarro. He arrived at the city of Quito, where he found Lorenzo de Aldana, and by virtue of the authority we have mentioned, they received him as Governor of Quito, San Miguel, Puerto Viejo, Guayaquil and Pasto. Soon afterwards Pedro de Puelles, who had been the Governor\u0027s lieutenant at Quito, arrived on the sea coast. \\n\\n \\n\\n Now Gonzalo Pizarro was desirous of undertaking some expedition, and observing in that city of Quito many men, all either youths or veterans, he became eager for the discovery of the valley of El Dorado, based on the same story which the captains Pedro de A?asco and Belalcázar had brought, and on what was said of the land of Cinnamon which, a short time before, had been invaded by the captain Gonzalo Díaz de Pineda. This Pineda, with a party of Spaniards, penetrated as far as some very lofty mountains, but many Indians came from their lower slopes to prevent the Spaniards from advancing further. These Indians killed some of the Spaniards, and amongst them a cleric. They had made many trenches and ditches. Pineda\u0027s party advanced for some days until they came to the Quijos, and the Cinnamon valley. They returned to Quito without having been able to fully explore the region of which they had heard such great things. The Indians said that further on, if they advanced, they would come to a widespreading flat country, teeming with Indians who possess great riches, for they all wear gold ornaments, and where are no forests nor mountain[56] ranges.[32] When this news was spread in Quito, every one who was there wanted to take part in the expedition. The Governor Gonzalo Pizarro began to make preparations and collect men and horses. In a few days he got together 220 Spaniards, horse and foot,[33] naming Don Antonio de Rivera to be Camp-master, and Juan de Acosta Ensign-general. As soon as the men of the expedition had been mustered Gonzalo Pizarro ordered Don Antonio de Rivera to go forward with the vanguard. Don Antonio replied that he would do so gladly, and all got ready to start. In the city of Quito, Pedro de Puelles remained as Lieutenant and Chief Justice. They started well equipped, and with plenty of provisions.[34] The natives of Quito, on seeing them pass beyond their domains, declared that they would find great riches, and praised the land of which news had been brought; while the Spaniards already imagined the plunder before their eyes, and believed it theirs. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971/56432.html","bookId":729,"book":{"id":729,"title":"The War of Chupas","description":"简介： Pedro de Cieza de Len was, on the whole, the most important historian, and is now the best authority, on ancient Peru, so far as his work has reached us; for he was a great traveller, and an eye-witness of much that he described....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM"}}
