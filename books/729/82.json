{"id":23710,"no":82,"title":"CHAPTER LXXXI","content":"Of the things that happened to Gonzalo Pizarro until he came safely out of the Canela expedition and arrived at the city of Cuzco. \n \n THE reader will remember that in previous chapters we mentioned the great labours and dire want of Gonzalo Pizarro and those who survived in the valley of the Canela, and the great desire they felt that God, our Lord, would show them some way by which they might return[290] to a Christian land. Having heard the account of the two Spaniards who had gone up the river in a canoe, and how they had seen that great mountain range or cordillera, Gonzalo Pizarro resolved to ascend the river with the remnant of his men as speedily as possible. So all the people got ready, some Spaniards going ahead to clear the way with axes and bush knives. Passing not a few swamps, they arrived after ten days\u0027 travel at the mark left by the men who had gone up the river before. Here Gonzalo Pizarro ordered Juan de Acosta to go with a small party, as quickly as possible, to where the Indians said there was a village. Juan de Acosta thereupon set out with eighteen Spaniards, armed with their swords and bucklers, and after walking for a good long time, they came to the village they were in quest of, on a high hill and very strong. But the Indians had no mind to admit them if they could help it, and with their usual dash they came out armed to oppose them. Juan de Acosta and his companions, though exhausted by hunger, entered like true Spaniards upon the encounter. After Juan de Acosta and two others had been wounded, the Indians fled, as usual. The Spaniards then ascended the hill and rushed the village, where they found plenty of food, to the no small delight of those sorry starvelings. They saw that the country they were in was a vast uninhabited wilderness, which must be traversed to reach Quito. Gonzalo Pizarro followed Juan de Acosta with the rest of the party, and in passing those swamps eight Spaniards died. When the worn-out survivors knew that they must cross that great wilderness, they were much afflicted, having all passed through so many hardships and sufferings. They cursed their luck which had been so adverse to them. But in the end, making the best of their misfortunes, those who remained alive prepared to face that infernal journey, taking the sick along on the few horses left to them as best they could. \n \n [291] \n \n So they toiled over the uninhabited waste, eating of all sorts, without leaving a dog, nor saddle leather, nor anything else that they could tear with their teeth. After having passed through infinite labour and fatigue they arrived at the village of Coca (where they had originally entered the Canela country) on foot, shoeless, and so transfigured that they could scarcely recognize each other. The natives received them as friends, and gave them what supplies they had; and, to get themselves into some sort of order, it was settled that they should stay there for ten days. In talking to the Indians it was found that there was a shorter way to Quito by another track, not the one they had followed, so they determined to take it. But on this track they met with several broad and very deep rivers, so that they were obliged to make bridges over some of them. Journeying in this way they came to a river which was so rapid that it took them four days to make a bridge; and whilst keeping watch at night, lest the Indians should come and attack them by surprise, they saw a great comet traversing the heavens. In the morning Gonzalo Pizarro said that, in his dreams, a dragon came and plucked out his heart, and tore it to pieces with his cruel teeth. He then sent for one Jerónimo de Villegas, who was held to be something of an astrologer, to ask him what he thought of it. He is said to have answered that Pizarro would find that the object he most prized was dead. After other things had occurred, which may be counted as trifles rather than as history, Gonzalo Pizarro and the remnant of his followers finally reached the confines of Quito. Those who survived from that expedition say that 240 Spaniards started on it, and that most of them died of hunger, though they took with them from Quito 6,000 pigs, 300 horses and pack animals, 900 dogs, and many sheep, all of which were eaten or lost. \n \n We cannot lightly describe the deep sorrow Gonzalo[292] Pizarro showed when he heard of the disastrous death of his brother. Although Sarmiento, his Lieutenant, sent horses for him and some of his companions, they would not mount them, but preferred to enter Quito on foot, in such sort that it was grievous to see them. When Gonzalo Pizarro heard that Vaca de Castro had been accepted as Governor by the whole Realm, he felt it keenly. He said that he ought to govern, and that the King had been very ungrateful in not ordering that he was to succeed, on the death of the Marquis. He began to prepare to go in search of Vaca de Castro, wherever he might be; for it was not then known that the war was ended, nor that the victory had fallen to him in the battle. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971/56503.html","bookId":729,"book":{"id":729,"title":"The War of Chupas","description":"简介： Pedro de Cieza de Len was, on the whole, the most important historian, and is now the best authority, on ancient Peru, so far as his work has reached us; for he was a great traveller, and an eye-witness of much that he described....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM"}}
