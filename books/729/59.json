{"id":23687,"no":59,"title":"CHAPTER LVIII","content":"How the Governor Vaca de Castro, leaving the plains, ascended from Santa by the mountain road, and how he met Gómez de Alvarado, and was annoyed on learning that he came without permission from Alonso de Alvarado; and how the Provincial, Fr. Tomás de San Martín, also arrived. \\n\\n \\n\\n THE Governor Vaca de Castro arrived at a coast valley they call Santa, where there is a large river, and where great edifices and houses, now in ruins, formerly stood. The plains and meadow lands along the banks of the river were covered with brambles and cane-brakes and dense[196] bush, where great quantities of mosquitos are bred; and at the time when Vaca de Castro was there these were by no means few. It was a great plague, and tormented the Governor and those who were with him to such an extent that, without tarrying long amidst such malign company, hasty preparations were made for ascending the heights. They followed the road to the right of the provinces of Moro and Quizquiz,[99] taking a supply of provisions with them, and some Indians who carried the baggage. The captain Pedro Vergara had remained in Truxillo, to gather in some men who had stayed behind, but in a short time he overtook the Governor, who was travelling by stages. As they ascended to the high elevations in the mountains, that common ailment of the head which overtakes everybody attacked him and most of the others, and used them so ill that they felt like being on the sea. At the end of some days the Governor arrived at a village called Tozal, where he was told by a Spaniard he found there that in the camp of the captain Alonso de Alvarado, some words had passed between the latter and a youth named Gómez de Alvarado \"the lad.\"[100] When he heard of the approach of Vaca de Castro, this young man had quitted the camp without his captain\u0027s permission, and was coming to join the Governor.[197] Vaca de Castro was displeased on hearing this and the more so in that he should be coming without leave from his captain, Alonso de Alvarado. Calling his secretary, the Governor instructed him to draft an order and go and notify it to Gómez de Alvarado, requiring him, under severe penalties in case of default, to return and place himself under his captain\u0027s banner. And he directed Merlo to then go with Gómez, until he had seen him safely under his captain\u0027s orders. Presently Merlo started off with the order to do what was commanded by the Governor, and went on until he came to where Gómez de Alvarado was quartered. With him he found the Provincial, Fr. Tomás de San Martín, who, when at Lima, had heard of the coming of Vaca de Castro; and, wishing to further the king\u0027s service, had presently set out to meet him, and had now come by way of Guaraz and the place where Alonso de Alvarado had formed his camp, and also by that of Pero Alvarez Holguin. All the officers of both camps enjoyed his company, and he theirs. One day when Alonso de Alvarado was in his own camp a coolness took place over some contention, and high words passed between that captain and Gómez de Alvarado. The Provincial intervened and made peace between them. Gómez de Alvarado then asked leave of the captain to go and seek for the Governor Vaca de Castro, which leave was refused. So he went out from the camp without leave, and when this became known to the Governor he sent Merlo with the order already mentioned. Arrived at the quarters at Guaylas, Merlo found Friar Tomás and Gómez de Alvarado lodging there, having travelled together from the camp. As Gómez was a cavalier of such high rank, Merlo thought it advisable to inform the Provincial what the Governor had sent him to do. The Provincial listened, and counselled Gómez de Alvarado to set out at once to meet Vaca de Castro, as he was so near. Holding this to be good advice, Gómez ordered his[198] horse to be saddled and, without letting Merlo know it, promptly rode away to where he thought he would find the Governor. He was ushered before Vaca de Castro and explained his great desire to serve him, and that he had left the camp of Alonso de Alvarado in order to find him the sooner. \\n\\n \\n\\n Vaca de Castro was much annoyed that Gómez de Alvarado should have come in this way, instead of obeying his order to return to the camp of Alonso de Alvarado; but, as there was now no remedy for it, he dissembled his anger before the young man. Presently they set out for the station at Guaylas where the Governor and all who were with him suffered in their heads from mountain sickness, and felt as if they were on the high seas. Here the Provincial spoke to Vaca de Castro and freely offered his services, and the Governor welcomed him very cordially. From this place Vaca de Castro ordered Gómez de Alvarado to go to the camp of Alonso de Alvarado, as he was informed that he had quitted it without leave or assent. He would not allow any one to withdraw from the ranks of captains who had done such good service to the king, without their assent. Gómez de Alvarado felt aggrieved that the Governor should order him to return to where the captain Alonso de Alvarado was. He tried by means of words to excuse himself from going, but this availed him nothing. So he went, and the Provincial, Fr. Tomás, went with him; and when they arrived, he put himself between the two, and prevailed upon them to make friends. Having arrived at the quarters at Guaylas on Easter eve, the Governor resolved to halt there for two days, with the assent of all who came with him. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971/56480.html","bookId":729,"book":{"id":729,"title":"The War of Chupas","description":"简介： Pedro de Cieza de Len was, on the whole, the most important historian, and is now the best authority, on ancient Peru, so far as his work has reached us; for he was a great traveller, and an eye-witness of much that he described....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1971","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:13 AM"}}
