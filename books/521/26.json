{"id":27835,"no":26,"title":"Chapter 26 Beth","content":"On Wednesday, Beth stared out her classroom window at lunchtime. She had never seen anything like it—hurricanes and nor\u0027easters had nothing on the series of storms that had recently pounded Hampton County as well as every county from Raleigh to the coast. The problem was that unlike most tropical storms, these weren\u0027t passing quickly out to sea. Instead, they had lingered day after thunderous day, bringing nearly every river in the eastern part of the state to flood levels. Small towns along the Pamlico, Neuse, and Cape Fear rivers were already knee-deep in water, and Hampton was getting close. Another day or two of rain would mean that most of the businesses downtown would be reachable only by canoe. The county had already decided to close the schools for the rest of the week, since the school buses could no longer make their routes and only a little more than half the teachers had been able to make it in. Ben, of course, was thrilled by the idea of staying home and playing in the puddles with Zeus, but Beth was a little more leery. Both the newspapers and the local news had reported that while the South River had already risen to dangerous levels, it was going to get far worse before it got better as the creeks and tributaries fed the rise. The two creeks that surrounded the kennel, usually a quarter mile away, could now be seen from the windows of the house, and Logan was even keeping Zeus away because of the debris washed out with the deluge. Being trapped indoors was hard on the kids, which was one of the reasons she\u0027d stayed in her classroom. After lunch, they\u0027d return to their classrooms, where in theory they\u0027d happily color or draw or read quietly in lieu of playing kick ball or basketball or tag outside. In reality, kids needed to get their energy out, and she knew it. For years, she\u0027d been asking that on days like this, they simply fold up the cafeteria lunch tables and allow the kids to run or play for twenty minutes, so they could concentrate when they returned to class after lunch. Not a chance, she was told, because of regulatory issues, liability issues, janitorial union issues, and health and safety issues. When asked what that meant, she was given a long explanation, but to her, it all came down to French fries. As in, We shouldn\u0027t allow kids to slip on French fries, or, If they do slip on French fries, the school district will get sued, or, The janitors would have to renegotiate their contract if they didn\u0027t clean the French fries from the cafeteria at the time they were scheduled to do so, and finally, If someone slipped on a French fry that had fallen on the floor, the children might be exposed to harmful pathogens. Welcome to the world of lawyers, she thought. Lawyers, after all, didn\u0027t have to teach the kids after keeping them cooped up inside the classroom all day with no recess. Usually, she would have retreated to the teacher\u0027s lounge for lunch, but with so little time to set up the classroom for activities, she\u0027d decided to stay and get things ready. In the corner, she was setting up a beanbag-tossing game—stored in the closet for just such emergencies—when she noted movement from the doorway. She turned that way, and it took her an instant to register who it was. The shoulders of his uniform were wet, and a few water droplets dripped from the belt where he stored his gun. In his hand was a manila file. \"Hi, Beth,\" he said. His voice was quiet, \"Do you have a minute?\" She stood. \"What is it, Keith?\" \"I came to apologize,\" he said. He clasped his hands in front of him, the picture of contrition. \"I know you don\u0027t have a lot of time, but I wanted to talk to you when you were alone. I took a chance that you\u0027d be here, but if it\u0027s not a good time, maybe we could set up another time that\u0027s better for you.\" She glanced at the clock. \"I\u0027ve got five minutes,\" she said. Keith stepped into the classroom and started to close the door. Midway, he paused, seeking her permission. She nodded, wanting to get whatever he had to say over with. He moved toward her, stopping at a respectful distance. \"Like I said, I came here to tell you I was sorry.\" \"About what?\" \"About the rumors you heard,\" he said. \"I wasn\u0027t completely truthful with you.\" She crossed her arms. \"In other words, you lied,\" she stated. \"Yes.\" \"You lied to my face.\" \"Yes.\" \"About what?\" \"You asked if I ever ran off some of the guys you\u0027ve dated in the past. I don\u0027t think I did, but I didn\u0027t tell you that I did talk to some of them.\" \"You talked to them.\" \"Yes.\" She did her best to keep her anger in check. \"And … what? You\u0027re sorry you did it, or sorry you lied?\" \"Both. I\u0027m sorry I did it, I\u0027m sorry I lied. I shouldn\u0027t have done those things.\" He paused. \"I know we haven\u0027t had the greatest relationship since the divorce, and I also know that you think marrying me was a mistake. You\u0027re right about that. We weren\u0027t meant to be married, and I accept that. But between the two of us—and i\u0027ll be honest, you\u0027ve had a lot more to do with this than me—we have a great son. You might not think I\u0027m the best father in the world, but I\u0027ve never once regretted having Ben, or having Ben live with you most of the time. He\u0027s a great kid, and you\u0027ve done a great job with him.\" She wasn\u0027t sure what to say. In the silence, he went on. \"But I still worry, and I always have. Like I told you, I worry about who comes into Ben\u0027s life, whether it be friends, or acquaintances, or even people that you might introduce to him. I know that\u0027s not fair and that you probably consider it an intrusion into your personal life, but that\u0027s the way I am. And to be honest, I don\u0027t know if I\u0027m ever going to change.\" \"So you\u0027re saying that you\u0027ll keep following me forever?\" \"No,\" he said quickly. \"I won\u0027t do it again. I was just explaining why I did it before. And trust me—I didn\u0027t threaten those guys or try to intimidate them. I talked to them. I explained that Ben meant a lot to me and that being his father was the most important thing in my life. You may not always agree with the way I parent him, but if you think back a couple of years, it wasn\u0027t always like this. He used to enjoy coming over to my place. Now he doesn\u0027t. But I haven\u0027t changed. He\u0027s changed. Not in a bad way—growing up is normal, and that\u0027s all he\u0027s been doing. And maybe I need to realize and accept the tact that he\u0027s getting older.\" She said nothing. As Keith watched her, he drew a long breath. \"I also told those men that I didn\u0027t want you to get hurt. I know that might sound like I was being possessive, but I wasn\u0027t. I said it like a brother would have said it. Like Drake would have said it. As in, if you like her, if you respect her, just make sure you treat her that way. That\u0027s all I said to them.\" He shrugged. \"I don\u0027t know. Maybe some of them took it the wrong way because I\u0027m a deputy or because of my last name, but I can\u0027t help those things. Believe me, the last thing I want is for you to be unhappy. It might not have worked out between us, but you\u0027re the mother of my son and you always will be.\" Keith\u0027s gaze fell as he shuffled his feet. \"You have every reason to be angry with me-I was wrong.\" \"Yes, you were.\" Beth remained where she stood, arms crossed. \"Like I said, I\u0027m sorry and it\u0027s never going to happen again.\" She didn\u0027t respond right away. \"Okay,\" she finally said. \"I\u0027m going to hold you to that.\" He flashed a quick, almost defeated smile. \"Fair enough.\" \"Is that it?\" She bent to retrieve three beanbags from the closet floor. \"Actually, I also wanted to talk to you about Logan Thibault. There\u0027s something you should know about him.\" She held up her hands to stop him. \"Don\u0027t even go there.\" He wasn\u0027t dissuaded. Instead, he took a step forward, kneading the brim of his hat. \"I\u0027m not going to talk to him unless you want me to talk to him. I want to make that clear. Believe me, Beth. This is serious. I wouldn\u0027t be here if it wasn\u0027t. I\u0027m here because I care about you.\" His chutzpah nearly took her breath away. \"Do you honestly expect me to believe you have my best interests at heart after admitting that you\u0027ve been spying on me for years? And that you were responsible for ruining any chance I had of finding a relationship?\" \"This has nothing to do with those things.\" \"Let me guess … you think he\u0027s using drugs, right?\" \"I have no idea. But I should warn you that he hasn\u0027t been honest with you.\" \"You have no idea whether he\u0027s been honest with me. Now get out. I don\u0027t want to talk to you, I don\u0027t want to hear what you have to say—\" \"Then ask him yourself,\" Clayton interrupted. \"Ask him whether he came to Hampton to find you.\" \"I\u0027m done,\" she declared, moving toward the door so much as touch me on the way out, I\u0027m going to scream for help.\" She walked past him, and as she was about to cross the threshold, Keith sighed audibly. \"Ask him about the photograph,\" he said. His comment brought her to a halt. \"What?\" Keith\u0027s expression was as serious as she\u0027d ever seen it, \"The photograph he got from Drake.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2101/59650.html","bookId":521,"book":{"id":521,"title":"The Lucky One 幸运符","description":"简介： 《幸运符》是《纽约时报》畅销书排行榜榜首作家爱情小说圣手尼古拉斯斯帕克思最斯帕克思味的真爱之篇，一个男人与死亡擦身而过，命运的力量却引领他找到一生的挚爱。在战火纷飞的伊拉克，前美国海军陆战队队员蒂伯在废墟里捡到一张照片，照片上一个年轻女人微笑着。自此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201804/25/10-42-16-95-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2101","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
