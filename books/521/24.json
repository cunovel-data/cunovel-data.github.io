{"id":27833,"no":24,"title":"Chapter 24 Clayton","content":"Clayton didn\u0027t want to believe it, but there was Gramps actually complimenting Thigh-bolt after church. Shaking his hand, acting like he was some sort of hero while Ben stared up at Thigh-bolt with big puppy-dog eyes. It was all he could do to make it through brunch without cracking open a beer, and since dropping Ben at his mother\u0027s, he\u0027d already gone through four. He was pretty sure he\u0027d finish off the twelve-pack before turning in. In the past two weeks, he\u0027d had a lot of beer. He knew he was overdoing it, but it was the only thing that kept him from dwelling on the latest run-in with Thigh-bolt. Behind him, the phone rang. Again. Fourth time in the last couple of hours, but he wasn\u0027t in the mood to answer it. Okay, he admitted it. He had underestimated the guy. Thigh-bolt had been one step ahead of him from the very beginning. He used to think Ben knew how to press his buttons; this guy dropped bombs. No, Clayton thought suddenly, he didn\u0027t drop bombs. He directed cruise missiles with pinpoint accuracy, all geared toward the destruction of Clayton\u0027s life. Even worse, Clayton hadn\u0027t seen it corning. Not once. It was beyond frustrating, especially since the situation seemed to be getting worse. Now, Thigh-bolt was telling him what to do. Ordering him around, like he was some flunkie on payroll, and for the life of him, Clayton couldn\u0027t figure a way out. He wanted to believe that Thigh-bolt had been bluffing about videotaping the break-in. He had to be bluffing—no one was that smart. He had to be. But what if he wasn\u0027t? Clayton went to the refrigerator and opened another beer, knowing he couldn\u0027t risk it. Who knew what the guy was planning next? He took a long pull, praying for the numbing effect to kick in soon. This should have been easier to handle. He was a deputy sheriff, and the guy was new in town. Clayton should have had the power all along, but instead he found himself sitting in a messy kitchen because he hadn\u0027t wanted to ask Ben to clean it for fear the kid would tell Thigh-bolt, which just might spell the end of Clayton\u0027s life as he knew it. What did the guy have against him? That\u0027s what Clayton wanted to know. Clayton wasn\u0027t the one causing problems, Thigh-bolt was the one making things difficult—and to rub salt in the wound, the guy was sleeping with Beth as well. He took another drink, wondering how his life could have turned to crap so quickly. Sunk in misery, he barely registered the sound of someone knocking at the front door. He pushed back from the table and stumbled through the living room. When he opened the door, he saw Tony standing on the porch, looking like a drowned rat. As if everything else weren\u0027t bad enough, the worm was here. Tony took a slight step back. \"Whoa, dude. You okay ? You smell like you\u0027ve been drinking.\" \"What do you want, Tony?\" He wasn\u0027t in the mood for this. \"I\u0027ve been trying to call you, but you didn\u0027t pick up.\" \"Get to the point.\" \"I haven\u0027t seen you around much lately.\" \"I\u0027ve been busy. And I\u0027m busy now, so go away.\" He started to close the door, and Tony raised his hand. \"Wait! I have something to tell you,\" he whined. \"It\u0027s important.\" \"What is it?\" \"Do you remember when I called you? I don\u0027t know, it must have been a couple of months ago?\" \"No.\" \"You remember. I called you from Decker\u0027s about this guy showing Beth\u0027s picture around?\" \"And?\" \"That\u0027s what I wanted to tell you.\" He pushed a clump of greasy hair out of his eyes. \"I saw him again today. And I saw him talking to Beth.\" \"What are you talking about?\" \"After church. He was talking to Beth and your grandfather. He was the dude on the piano today.\" Despite the buzz, Clayton felt his head begin to clear. It came back to him vaguely at first, then sharper. That was the weekend Thigh-bolt had taken the camera and disk. \"You sure?\" \"Yeah, I\u0027m sure. I\u0027d remember that dude anywhere.\" \"He had Beth\u0027s picture?\" \"I already told you that. I saw it. I just thought it was weird, you know? And then I see them together today? I thought you\u0027d want to know.\" Clayton processed Tony\u0027s news. \"I want you to tell me everything you can remember about the picture.\" Tony the worm had a surprisingly good memory, and it didn\u0027t take long for Clayton to get the full story. That the picture was a few years old and had been taken at the fair. That Thigh-bolt didn\u0027t know her name. That Thigh-bolt was looking for her. After Tony left, Clayton continued to ponder what he\u0027d learned. No way had Thigh-bolt been here five years ago and forgotten her name- So where did he get the picture? Had he walked across ￡e country to find her? And if so, what did that mean\u0027 That he\u0027d stalked her? He wasn\u0027t sure yet, but something wasn\u0027t right. And Beth, naive as usual, had allowed him not only into her bed, but into Ben\u0027s life as well. He frowned. He didn\u0027t like it. He didn\u0027t like it at all and he was pretty sure Beth wouldn\u0027t like it, either. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2101/59648.html","bookId":521,"book":{"id":521,"title":"The Lucky One 幸运符","description":"简介： 《幸运符》是《纽约时报》畅销书排行榜榜首作家爱情小说圣手尼古拉斯斯帕克思最斯帕克思味的真爱之篇，一个男人与死亡擦身而过，命运的力量却引领他找到一生的挚爱。在战火纷飞的伊拉克，前美国海军陆战队队员蒂伯在废墟里捡到一张照片，照片上一个年轻女人微笑着。自此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201804/25/10-42-16-95-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2101","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
