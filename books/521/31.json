{"id":27840,"no":31,"title":"Chapter 31 Clayton","content":"Clayton tried and failed to negotiate the lake that had formed in front of Beth\u0027s house, his boots disappearing into the mud. He stifled the urge to issue a string of profanities. He could see the windows open near the front door, and he knew that Nana would hear him. Despite her age, the woman had the hearing of an owl, and the last thing he wanted to do was make a poor impression. The woman already disliked him enough. He climbed the steps and knocked on the door. He thought he heard someone moving inside, saw Beth\u0027s face in the window, and finally watched as the door swung open. \"Keith? What are you doing here?\" \"I was worried,\" he said. \"I wanted to make sure everything was okay.\" \"It\u0027s fine,\" she said. \"Is he still here? Do you want me to talk to him?\" \"No. He\u0027s gone. I don\u0027t know where he is.\" Clayton shuffled his feet, trying to look contrite, i\u0027m sorry about this, and I hate that I had to be the one to tell you. I know you really liked him.\" Beth nodded, her lips pursed… \"I also wanted to tell you not to be so hard on yourself. Like I mentioned earlier, people like that… they\u0027ve learned to hide it. They\u0027re sociopaths, and there\u0027s no way you could have known.\" Beth crossed her arms. \"I don\u0027t want to talk about it.\" Clayton held up his hands, knowing he\u0027d pushed too hard, knowing he had to backtrack. \"I figured. And you\u0027re right. It\u0027s not my place, especially given the crappy way I\u0027ve treated you in the past.\" He tucked his thumb into his belt and forced a smile. \"I just wanted to make sure you were doing okay.\" \"I\u0027m fine. And thanks.\" Clayton turned to leave, then stopped. \"I want you to know that from what Ben said, Thibault seemed like a nice guy.\" She looked up in surprise. \"I just wanted to tell you that, because had it been different— had anything happened to Ben— Thibault would have regretted the day he was born. I would die before I let anything happen to our son. And I know you feel the same way. That\u0027s why you\u0027re such a great mom. In a life where I\u0027ve made a ton of mistakes, one of the best things I\u0027ve done is to let you raise him.\" She nodded, trying to stop the tears, and turned away. When she swiped at her eyes, Clayton took a step toward her. \"Hey,\" he said, his voice soft. \"I know you don\u0027t want to hear this now, but trust me, you did the right thing. And in time, you\u0027re going to find someone, and I\u0027m sure he\u0027s going to be the best guy ever. You deserve that.\" Her breath hiccuped, and Clayton reached out for her. Instinctively, she leaned into him. \"It\u0027s okay,\" he whispered, and for a long moment, they stood on the porch, their bodies close together as he held her. Clayton didn\u0027t stay long. There was no need, he thought: He\u0027d accomplished what he\u0027d set out to do. Beth now saw him as the kind, caring, and compassionate friend, someone who\u0027d atoned for his sins. The hug was just the icing on the cake—nothing he\u0027d planned, but a nice conclusion to their encounter. He wouldn\u0027t press her. That would be a mistake. She needed some time to get over Thigh-bolt. Even if he was a sociopath, even if the guy left town, feelings aren\u0027t turned on and off like a switch. But they would pass as surely as the rain would continue to fell. Next step: to make sure that Thigh-bolt was on his way back to Colorado. And then? Be the nice guy. Maybe invite Beth over while he and Ben were doing something, ask her to stay for a barbecue. Keep it casual at first, so she didn\u0027t suspect anything, and then suggest doing something with Ben on another night of the week. It was essential that he keep the whole thing far from Nana\u0027s prying eyes, which meant staying away from here. Though he knew Beth wouldn\u0027t be thinking straight for at least a few weeks, Nana would be, and the last thing he wanted was for Nana to get in Beth\u0027s ear about what he was likely up to. After that, as they got used to each other again, maybe they\u0027d have a few beers together while Ben was sacked out, sort of a spur-of-the-moment thing. Maybe spike her beer with a bit of vodka so she couldn\u0027t drive home. Then offer to let her sleep in the bed while he took the couch. Be the perfect gentleman, but keep the beer flowing. Talk about the old times—the good ones— and let her cry about Thigh-bolt. Let the emotions flow and slip a comforting arm around her. He smiled as he started the car, pretty sure he knew what would happen after that.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2101/59655.html","bookId":521,"book":{"id":521,"title":"The Lucky One 幸运符","description":"简介： 《幸运符》是《纽约时报》畅销书排行榜榜首作家爱情小说圣手尼古拉斯斯帕克思最斯帕克思味的真爱之篇，一个男人与死亡擦身而过，命运的力量却引领他找到一生的挚爱。在战火纷飞的伊拉克，前美国海军陆战队队员蒂伯在废墟里捡到一张照片，照片上一个年轻女人微笑着。自此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201804/25/10-42-16-95-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2101","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
