{"id":27828,"no":19,"title":"Chapter 19 Thibault","content":"Late Saturday evening, after Elizabeth had left, Thibault found Victor sitting in his living room, still dressed in the shorts and cabana-style shirt he\u0027d been wearing on the day he died. The sight of him stopped Thibault in his tracks. All he could do was stare. It wasn\u0027t possible, nor was it really happening. Thibault knew that Victor was gone, buried in a small plot near Bakersfield. He knew Zeus would have reacted had anyone real been in the house, but Zeus simply wandered to his water bowl. In the silence, Victor smiled. \"There is more,\" he said, his voice a hoarse promise. When Thibault blinked, Victor was gone, and it was obvious he\u0027d never been there at all. It was the third time Thibault had seen Victor since he had passed away. The first time had been at the funeral, when Thibault had rounded a corner near the back of the church and seen Victor staring at him from the end of the hallway. \"It\u0027s not your fault,\" Victor had said before dissolving away. Thibault\u0027s throat had closed up, forcing him to rush to catch his breath. The second appearance occurred three weeks before he set out on his walk. That time, it had happened in the grocery store, as Thibault was rummaging through his wallet, trying to figure out how much beer he could purchase. He\u0027d been drinking heavily in those days, and as he counted the bills, he saw an image from the corner of his eye. Victor shook his head but said nothing. He didn\u0027t have to. Thibault knew that he was being told that it was time to end the drinking. Now, this. Thibault didn\u0027t believe in ghosts, and he knew that the image of Victor hadn\u0027t been real. There was no specter haunting him, no visits from beyond, no restless spirit with a message to deliver. Victor was a figment of his imagination, and Thibault knew that his subconscious had conjured up the image. After all, Victor had been the one person Thibault had always listened to. He knew the boating accident had been just that: an accident. The kids who\u0027d been driving the boat had been traumatized, and their horror at what had happened was genuine. As for the drinking, he\u0027d known deep down that the booze was doing more harm than good. Somehow, though, it was easier to listen to Victor. The last thing he\u0027d expected was to see his friend once more. He considered Victor\u0027s words—there is more—and wondered whether they related to his conversation with Elizabeth. Somehow he didn\u0027t think so, but he couldn\u0027t figure it out, and it nagged at him. He suspected that the harder he pressed himself for an answer, the less likely it was that the answer would come. The subconscious was funny like that. He wandered to the small kitchen to pour himself a glass of milk, put some food in the bowl for Zeus, and went to his room. Lying in bed, he brooded on the things he\u0027d told Elizabeth. He\u0027d thought long and hard about saying anything at all. He wasn\u0027t even certain what he\u0027d hoped to accomplish by doing so, other than to open her eyes to the possibility that Keith Clayton might just be controlling her life in ways she couldn\u0027t imagine. Which was exactly what the man was doing. Thibault had become sure of it when he\u0027d first noticed the break-in. Of course, it could have been anyone—someone wanting to make a quick buck grabbing items that could be sold in pawnshops—but the way it had been done suggested otherwise. It was too neat. Nothing had been strewn about. Nothing was even out of place. Nearly everything had, however, been adjusted. The blanket on the bed was the first giveaway. There was a tiny ridge in the blanket, caused by someone who didn\u0027t know how to tuck in the covers military fashion—something few, if anyone, would have noticed. He noticed. The clothes in his drawers showed similar disturbances: a rumple here, a sleeve folded the wrong way there. Not only had someone entered the home while he\u0027d been at work, but he\u0027d searched the house thoroughly. But why? Thibault had nothing of value to steal. A quick peek through the windows beforehand made it plain there was nothing valuable in the place. Not only was the living room devoid of electronics, but the second bedroom stood completely empty, and the room where he slept contained only a bed, end table, and lamp. Aside from dishes and utensils and an ancient electric can opener on the counter, the kitchen was empty, too. The pantry contained dog food, a loaf of bread, and a jar of peanut butter. But someone had taken the time to search the house anyway from top to bottom, including under his mattress. Someone had diligently gone through his drawers and cleaned up afterward. No outrage at finding nothing of value. No evident frustration that the break-in had been a waste. Instead, the burglar had attempted to cover his tracks. Whoever had broken in had come to the house not to steal, but to look for something. Something specific. It hadn\u0027t taken long to figure out what it was and who had been responsible. Keith Clayton wanted his camera. Or, more likely, he wanted the disk. Probably because the photographs on the disk could get him in trouble. No great leap of logic, considering what Clayton had been doing the first time they\u0027d bumped into each other. All right, so Clayton wanted to cover his tracks. But there was still more to this than met the eye. And it had to do with Elizabeth. It didn\u0027t make sense that she hadn\u0027t had any relationships in the past ten years. But it did jibe with something he\u0027d heard while standing around the pool table, showing her picture to the group of locals. What had one of them said? It had taken a while to recall the exact words, and he wished he had paid more attention to the comment. He\u0027d been so focused on learning Elizabeth\u0027s name, he\u0027d ignored it at the time—a mistake. In hindsight, there was something menacing about the comment\u0027s implication. … let\u0027s just say she doesn\u0027t date. Her ex wouldn\u0027t like it, and trust me, you don\u0027t want to mess with him. He reviewed what he knew about Keith Clayton. Part of a powerful family. A bully. Quick to anger. In a position to abuse his power. Someone who thought he deserved whatever he wanted whenever he wanted it? Thibault couldn\u0027t be certain about the last one, but it all fit the picture. Clayton didn\u0027t want Elizabeth to see other men. Elizabeth hadn\u0027t had any meaningful relationships in years. Elizabeth occasionally wondered why but hadn\u0027t even considered the possible connection between her ex-husband and failed relationships. To Thibault, it seemed entirely plausible that Clayton was manipulating people and events and—at least in one way— still controlling her life. For Clayton to know that Elizabeth was dating someone in the past meant that Clayton had been watching over her for years. Just as he was watching over her now. It wasn\u0027t hard to imagine how Clayton had ended her previous relationships, but so far, he\u0027d kept his distance when it came to Thibault and Elizabeth. So far, Thibault hadn\u0027t seen him spying from afar, hadn\u0027t noticed anything out of the ordinary. Instead, Clayton had broken into his house in search of the disk when he knew Thibault would be at work. Getting his ducks in a row? Probably. But the question was, to what end? To run Thibault out of town, at the very least. Still, Thibault couldn\u0027t shake the feeling that this wouldn\u0027t be the end. As Victor had said, there is more. He\u0027d wanted to share with Elizabeth what he knew about her ex, but he couldn\u0027t come right out and tell her about the comment he\u0027d overheard at the pool hall. That would mean telling her about the photograph, and he couldn\u0027t do that yet. Instead, he wanted to point her in the right direction, hoping she would begin to make the connections herself. Together, once they both knew the extent to which Clayton was willing to sabotage her relationships, they would be able to handle whatever he chose to do. They loved each other. They would know what to expect. It would all work out. Was this the reason he\u0027d come? To fall in love with Elizabeth and make a life together? Was this his destiny? For some reason, it didn\u0027t feel right. Victor\u0027s words seemed to confirm that. There was another reason that he\u0027d come here. Falling in love with Elizabeth may have been part of it. But that wasn\u0027t all. Something else was coming. There is more. Thibault slept the rest of the night without waking, just as he had since arriving in North Carolina. A military thing—or, more accurately, a combat thing, something he\u0027d learned out of necessity. Tired soldiers made mistakes. His father had said that. Every officer he\u0027d ever known had said that. His wartime experience confirmed the truth of their statements. He\u0027d learned to sleep when it was time to sleep, no matter how chaotic things were, trusting he\u0027d be better for it the following day. Aside from the brief period after Victor\u0027s death, sleep had never been a problem. He liked sleep, and he liked the way his thoughts seemed to coalesce while he was dreaming. On Sunday, when he woke, he found himself visualizing a wheel with spokes extending from the center. He wasn\u0027t sure why, but a few minutes later, when he was walking Zeus outside, he was suddenly struck by the notion that Elizabeth wasn’t the center of the wheel, as he’d unconsciously assumed. Instead, he realized, everything that had happened since he’d arrived in Hampton seemed to revolve around Keith Clayton. Clayton, after all, had been the first person he’d met in town. He’d taken Clayton’s camera. Clayton and Elizabeth had been married. Clayton was Ben’s father. Clayton had sabotaged Elizabeth’s relationships. Clayton had seen them spending an evening together on the night he’d brought Ben home with the black eye, in other words, he’d been the first to know about them. Clayton had broken into his house. Clayton – not Elizabeth – was the reason he’d come to Hampton. In the distance, thunder sounded, low and ominous. There was a storm on the way, and the heaviness in the air portended a big one. Aside from what Elizabeth had told him about Clayton, he realized he knew very little about Elizabeth\u0027s former husband. As the first drops began to tall, Thibault went back inside. Later, he would visit the library. He had a little research ahead of him if he hoped to get a better feel for Hampton and the role the Claytons played in it. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2101/59643.html","bookId":521,"book":{"id":521,"title":"The Lucky One 幸运符","description":"简介： 《幸运符》是《纽约时报》畅销书排行榜榜首作家爱情小说圣手尼古拉斯斯帕克思最斯帕克思味的真爱之篇，一个男人与死亡擦身而过，命运的力量却引领他找到一生的挚爱。在战火纷飞的伊拉克，前美国海军陆战队队员蒂伯在废墟里捡到一张照片，照片上一个年轻女人微笑着。自此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201804/25/10-42-16-95-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2101","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
