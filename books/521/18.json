{"id":27827,"no":18,"title":"Chapter 18 Beth","content":"I take it you had a good time,\" Nana drawled. It was Sunday morning, and Beth had just stumbled down to the kitchen table. Ben was still sleeping upstairs. \"We did,\" she said, yawning. \"And?\" \"And … nothing.\" \"You got in kind of late, considering you did nothing.\" \"It wasn\u0027t that late. See? I\u0027m up bright and early.\" She poked her head into the refrigerator, then closed the door without removing anything. \"That would be impossible if I got in too late. And why are you so curious?\" \"I just want to know if I\u0027ll still have an employee on Monday.\" Nana poured herself a cup of coffee and collapsed into a chair at the table. \"I don\u0027t see why you wouldn\u0027t.\" \"So it went well?\" This time, Beth let the question hang for a moment as she remembered the evening. Stirring her coffee, she felt happier than she had in a long time. \"Yeah,\" she offered. \"It went well.\" * * * During the next few days, Beth spent as much time with Logan as she could, without making it seem too obvious to Ben. She wasn\u0027t sure why that felt important. It did seem consistent with the kind of advice family counselors would offer about the realities of dating when children were involved. But deep down, she knew that wasn\u0027t the entire reason. There was just something exciting about maintaining the pretense that nothing had changed between them; it gave the relationship an illicit feeling, almost like an affair. It didn\u0027t fool Nana, of course. Every now and then while Beth and Logan were engaged in keeping up their elaborate facade, Nana would mutter something nonsensical like \"camels in the Sahara\" or \"it\u0027s like hair and slippers.\" Later, with Logan, Beth would try to make sense of her mutterings. The first seemed to imply they were meant to be together; the second took a little longer to figure out, and she was stumped until Logan shrugged and suggested, \"Maybe it has something to do with \u0027Rapunzel\u0027 and \u0027Cinderella\u0027?\" Fairy tales. But good ones, with happily-ever-after endings. Nana being sweet without revealing herself as a softie. Those stolen moments when they were alone had an almost dreamlike intensity. Beth was hyperattuned to his every movement and gesture, tantalized by the quiet way he\u0027d take her hand as they trailed behind Ben on their evening walks, then release it as soon as Ben rounded into view again. Logan had a sixth sense about how far away Ben had wandered—a skill developed, she guessed, in the military—and she was grateful that her desire to fly under the radar for now didn\u0027t bother him in the slightest. To her relief, Logan continued to treat Ben exactly as he had before. On Monday, he showed up with a small bow-and-arrow set he\u0027d picked up at the sporting goods store. He and Ben spent an hour shooting at targets, time that was mainly used searching for wayward shots that ended up in prickly holly bushes or snagged in tree branches, leaving them both with scratches up to their elbows. After dinner, they ended up playing chess in the living room while she and Nana cleaned up the kitchen. As she dried the dishes, she concluded that if for no other reason, she could love Logan forever simply because of the way he treated her son. Despite maintaining a low profile, they still found excuses to be alone together. On Tuesday, when she got home from school, she noticed that with Nana\u0027s permission, he\u0027d installed a porch swing so \"we don\u0027t have to sit on the steps.\" While Ben was at his music lesson, she reveled in the slow, steady motion of the swing as she sat beside him. On Wednesday, she rode with him to town to pick up another load of dog food. Everyday activities, but simply being alone with him was enough. Sometimes when they were in the truck together, he\u0027d put his arm around her and she\u0027d lean into him, savoring how good it felt. She thought about him while she worked, imagining what he was doing or wondering what he and Nana were talking about. She pictured the way his shirt would tack against his skin with perspiration or his forearms would flex as he trained the dogs. On Thursday morning, as Logan and Zeus walked up the drive to begin work, she turned from the window in the kitchen. Nana was at the table, slowly working her way into her rubber boots, a challenge made more difficult by the weakness in her arm. Beth cleared her throat. \"Is it okay if Logan takes the day off?\" she asked. Nana didn\u0027t bother to hide the smirk on her face. \"Why?\" \"I want to get away with him today. Just the two of us.\" \"What about school?\" She was already dressed, her own lunch packed. \"I\u0027m thinking about calling in sick.\" \"Ah,\" Nana said. \"I love him, Nana,\" she blurted. Nana shook her head, but her eyes glittered. \"I was wondering when you\u0027d just come right out and say it, instead of making me come up with those silly riddles.\" \"Sorry.\" Nana stood and stomped a couple of times, making sure the boots were snug. A thin layer of dirt collected on the floor. \"I suppose I could handle things today. Probably be good for me. I\u0027ve been watching too much television anyway.\" Beth tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. \"Thank you.\" \"My pleasure. Just don\u0027t make a habit of it. He\u0027s the best employee we\u0027ve ever had.\" They spent the afternoon wrapped in each other\u0027s arms, making love over and over, and when it was finally time for her to return home—she wanted to be around when Ben got home from school-she was certain that Logan loved her as much as she loved him and that he, too, was beginning to imagine spending the rest of their lives together. The only thing that marred her perfect happiness was the sense she had that something was bothering him. It wasn\u0027t her—she was sure of that. Nor was it the state of their relationship; the way he acted when they were together made that obvious. It was something else, something she couldn\u0027t put her finger on, but in thinking back, she realized she\u0027d first noticed it on Tuesday afternoon, just after she\u0027d gotten home with Ben. Ben, as usual, had darted from the car to play with Zeus, anxious to burn off energy before his music lesson. As she stood visiting with Nana in the kennel office, she spied Logan standing in the yard, his hands in his pockets, seemingly lost in concentration. Even in the truck, as he\u0027d slipped his arm around her, she could tell he\u0027d remained preoccupied. And tonight after his game of chess with Ben, he\u0027d wandered out onto the porch alone. Beth joined him a few minutes later and took a seat beside him on the swing. \"Is something bothering you?\" she finally asked. He didn\u0027t answer right away. \"I\u0027m not sure,\" he said. \"Are you upset with me?\" He shook his head and smiled. \"Not at all.\" \"What\u0027s going on?\" He hesitated. \"I\u0027m not sure,\" he said again. She stared at him from beneath her lashes. \"Do you want to talk about it?\" \"Yeah,\" he said. \"But not yet.\" On Saturday, with Ben at his father\u0027s, they drove to Sunset Beach near Wilmington. By that point, the summer crowds had disappeared, and aside from a few people strolling the beach, they had the place to them.\u0027 selves. The ocean, fed by the Gulf, was still warm enough to enjoy, and they waded knee-deep in the surf as Logan lobbed a tennis ball beyond the breakers. Zeus was having the time of his life, paddling furiously and occasionally barking as if trying to intimidate the ball into staying in one place. She\u0027d packed a picnic along with some towels, and when Zeus grew tired, they retreated farther up the beach and settled down for lunch. Methodically, she pulled out the makings for sandwiches and cut up fresh fruit. As they ate, a shrimp trawler rode the horizon, and for a long time, Logan focused on it with the preoccupied gaze she\u0027d noticed on and off for most of the week. \"You\u0027re getting that look again,\" she finally said. \"What look?\" \"Spill it,\" she said, ignoring his question. \"What\u0027s bothering you? And no vague answers this time.\" \"I\u0027m fine,\" he said, turning to meet her gaze. \"I know I\u0027ve seemed a little off for the last few days, but I\u0027m just trying to figure something out.\" \"What, exactly?\" \"Why we\u0027re going out.\" Her heart skipped a beat. It wasn\u0027t what she\u0027d expected to hear, and she could feel her expression freeze. \"That came out wrong,\" he said, shaking his head quickly. \"I didn\u0027t mean it the way you think. I was thinking more about why this opportunity even existed. It doesn\u0027t make sense.\" She frowned. \"I\u0027m still not following you.\" Zeus, who\u0027d been lying beside them, lifted his head to watch a flock of seagulls that landed nearby. Beyond them, at the water\u0027s edge, were pipers darting about for tiny sand crabs. Logan studied them before going on. When he spoke, his voice was steady, like a professor elaborating on a subject he taught. \"If you look at this from my perspective, this is what I see: an intelligent, charming, beautiful woman, not yet thirty, witty, and passionate. Also, when she wishes, extremely seductive.\" He gave her a knowing smile before continuing. \"In other words, a catch, by pretty much anyone\u0027s definition.\" He paused. \"Stop me if I\u0027m making you uncomfortable.\" She reached over and tapped his knee. \"You\u0027re doing just fine,\" she said. \"Go on.\" He ran a restless hand through his hair. \"That\u0027s what I\u0027ve been trying to understand. I\u0027ve been thinking about it the last few days.\" She tried without success to follow his train of thought. This time instead of tapping his knee, she squeezed it. \"You need to learn to be more clear. I\u0027m still not following you.\" For the first time since she\u0027d known him, she saw a flash of impatience cross his features. Almost immediately it was gone, and she sensed somehow that it was directed more at himself than at her. \"I\u0027m saying that it doesn\u0027t make sense that you haven\u0027t had a relationship since your ex.\" He paused, as if searching for the right phrase. \"Yes, you have a son, and for some men, that might make a relationship with you a nonstarter. But then, you don\u0027t generally hide the fact that you\u0027re a mother, and I assume most people in this small town know your situation. Am I right?\" She hesitated. \"Yes.\" \"And the men who asked you out. They all knew you had a son in advance?\" \"Yes.\" He fixed her with a speculative expression. \"Then where are they?\" Zeus rotated his head into her lap. and she began to stroke him behind the ears, feeling her defensiveness rise, \"What does it matter?\" she asked. \"And to be honest, I\u0027m not sure I\u0027m all that thrilled with these kinds of questions. What happened in the past is my business, and I can\u0027t undo it, and I\u0027ll be damned if you\u0027re going to sit here and question me about who I dated and when I dated them and what happened on those dates. I am who I am, and I\u0027d think you of all people would understand that, Mr. I-walked-from-Colorado-but-don\u0027t-ask-me-why.\" He was quiet, and she knew he was reflecting on what she\u0027d said. When he spoke again, his voice brimmed with unexpected tenderness. \"I\u0027m not saying this to make you angry. I\u0027m saying this because I think you\u0027re the most remarkable woman I\u0027ve ever met.\" Again, he paused before going on, making sure his words had penetrated. \"The thing is, I\u0027m pretty sure that almost every man would feel the same way I do. And since you have gone out with other men, especially in this small town where there are only so many available women in your age group, I\u0027m sure they would have recognized the terrific person that you are. Okay, maybe some of them weren\u0027t your cup of tea, so you ended it. But what about the others? The ones you liked? There had to have been someone, somewhere along the line with whom you seemed to click.\" He scooped up a handful of sand and slowly spread his fingers, allowing the grains to slip through his fingers. \"That\u0027s what I\u0027ve been thinking about. Because it\u0027s just not plausible that you wouldn\u0027t have clicked with someone, and yet you told me yourself that you haven\u0027t had a lot of luck in the dating world.\" He wiped his hand on the towel. \"Am I wrong so far?\" She stared at him, wondering how he knew so much. \"No,\" she said. \"And you\u0027ve wondered about it, haven\u0027t you?\" \"Sometimes,\" she confessed. \"But don\u0027t you think you\u0027re reading way too much into this? Even if I were as perfect as you say, you have to remember that times have changed. There are probably thousands, if not tens of thousands, of women that you could describe in the same way.\" \"Perhaps.\" He shrugged. \"But you\u0027re not convinced.\" \"No.\" His clear blue eyes held her in their unwavering scrutiny. \"What? You think there\u0027s some sort of conspiracy?\" Instead of answering directly, he reached for another handful of sand. \"What can you tell me about your ex?\" he asked. \"Why does that matter?\" \"I\u0027m curious as to how he feels about you dating.\" \"I\u0027m sure he doesn\u0027t care in the slightest. And I can\u0027t imagine why you think that even matters.\" He released the sand all at once. \"Because,\" he said, his voice low. He turned toward her. \"I\u0027m pretty sure he was the one who broke into my house the other day.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2101/59642.html","bookId":521,"book":{"id":521,"title":"The Lucky One 幸运符","description":"简介： 《幸运符》是《纽约时报》畅销书排行榜榜首作家爱情小说圣手尼古拉斯斯帕克思最斯帕克思味的真爱之篇，一个男人与死亡擦身而过，命运的力量却引领他找到一生的挚爱。在战火纷飞的伊拉克，前美国海军陆战队队员蒂伯在废墟里捡到一张照片，照片上一个年轻女人微笑着。自此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201804/25/10-42-16-95-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2101","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
