{"id":27839,"no":30,"title":"Chapter 30 Beth","content":"Freshly showered, Beth was standing in her bedroom in an oversize T-shirt when Nana peeked her head in. \"Do you want to talk about it?\" Nana said. She jerked her thumb toward the window. \"The school called to tell me you were on your way home. The principal seemed a little worried about you, and later I saw you pull up to the office. I figured the two of you were having a spat.\" \"It\u0027s more than a spat, Nana,\" Beth said, her tone weary. \"That I gathered from the fact that he left. And that you stayed on the porch so long afterwards.\" Beth nodded. \"Was it about Ben? He didn\u0027t hurt him, did he? Or you?\" \"No, nothing like that,\" Beth said. \"Good. Because that\u0027s the one thing that can\u0027t be fixed.\" \"I\u0027m not sure this can, either.\" Nana stared out the window before heaving a great sigh. \"I take it I\u0027ll have to feed the dogs tonight, huh?\" Beth shot her a look of annoyance. \"Thanks for being so understanding\" \"Kitty cats and maple trees,\" she said with a wave of her hand. Beth thought about it before finally grunting in frustration. \"What does that mean?\" \"It means nothing, but for a second there, you were too exasperated to feel sorry for yourself.\" \"You don\u0027t understand…\" \"Try me,\" she said. Beth looked up. \"He stalked me, Nana. For five years, and then he trekked across the country to search for me. He was obsessed.\" Nana was uncharacteristically silent. \"Why don\u0027t you start from the beginning,\" she suggested, taking a seat on Beth\u0027s bed. Beth wasn\u0027t sure she wanted to talk about it, but she figured it was better to get it over with. She began by recounting Keith\u0027s visit to her classroom, and over the next twenty minutes, she told Nana about her abrupt departure from school, her agonizing un-certainty, and ended with her confrontation with Logan. When she finished, Nana folded her hands together in her lap. \"So Thibault admitted he had the picture? And—in your words—babbled about it being a lucky charm and claimed that he came here because he felt that he owed you something?\" Beth nodded. \"Pretty much.\" \"What did he mean by it being a lucky charm?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"You didn\u0027t ask?\" \"I didn\u0027t care, Nana. The whole thing is … creepy and weird. Who would do something like that?\" Nana\u0027s eyebrows knit together. \"I\u0027ll admit it sounds strange, but I think I would have wanted to know why he believed it was a lucky charm.\" \"Why does that matter?\" \"Because you weren\u0027t there,\" she emphasized. \"You didn\u0027t go through the things he did. Maybe he was telling the truth.\" Beth winced. \"The picture isn\u0027t a lucky charm. That\u0027s crazy.\" \"Maybe,\" Nana responded, \"but I\u0027ve been around long enough to know that strange things happen in war. Soldiers come to believe all sorts of things, and if they think something keeps the safe, what\u0027s the harm?\" Beth exhaled. \"It\u0027s one thing to believe it. It\u0027s entirely different to become obsessed with a photograph and stalk the subject.\" \u0027 Nana put a hand on Beth\u0027s knee. \"Everyone acts crazy at times.\" \"Not like this,\" Beth insisted. There\u0027s something scary about this.\" - Nana was quiet before letting out a sigh.\u0027 You might be right.\" She shrugged; Beth studied Nana\u0027s face, suddenly overcome with exhaustion. \"Will you do me a favor?\" \"What is it?\" \"Will you call the principal and ask him to bring Ben home after school? I don\u0027t want you driving in this weather, but I\u0027m not really up to doing it myself.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2101/59654.html","bookId":521,"book":{"id":521,"title":"The Lucky One 幸运符","description":"简介： 《幸运符》是《纽约时报》畅销书排行榜榜首作家爱情小说圣手尼古拉斯斯帕克思最斯帕克思味的真爱之篇，一个男人与死亡擦身而过，命运的力量却引领他找到一生的挚爱。在战火纷飞的伊拉克，前美国海军陆战队队员蒂伯在废墟里捡到一张照片，照片上一个年轻女人微笑着。自此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201804/25/10-42-16-95-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2101","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
