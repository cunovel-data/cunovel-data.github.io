{"id":27814,"no":5,"title":"Chapter 5 Clayton","content":"It was nine o\u0027clock on Saturday night, and he was stuck at home babysitting. Great. Just great. How else could a day like today end, though? First, one of the girls almost catches him taking pictures, then the department\u0027s camera gets stolen, and then Logan Thigh-bolt flattens his tires. Worse, he\u0027d had to explain both the loss of the camera and the tires to his dad, Mr. County Sheriff. Predictably, his dad was spit\u0027 ting mad and somehow didn\u0027t buy the story he\u0027d concocted. Instead he just kept peppering him with questions. By the end, Clayton had wanted to pop the old man. Dad might be a bigwig to a lot of the folks around here, but the man had no business talking to him like he was an idiot. But Clayton had kept to his story—he\u0027d thought he\u0027d seen someone, gone to investigate, and somehow run over a couple of nails. And the camera? Don\u0027t ask him. He had no idea if it had even been in the cruiser in the first place. Not great, he knew, but good enough. \"That looks more like a hole made by a buck-knife,\" said his dad, bending down, examining the tires. \"I told you it was nails.\" \"There\u0027s no construction out there.\" \"I don\u0027t know how it happened, either! I\u0027m just telling you what happened.\" \"Where are they?\" \"How the hell should I know? I pitched them in the woods.\" The old man wasn\u0027t convinced, but Clayton knew enough to stick to his story. Always stick to the story. It was when you started backtracking that people got in trouble. Interrogation 101. Eventually the old man left, and Clayton put on the spares and drove to the garage, where they patched the original tires. By then a couple of hours had passed, and he was late for an appointment with one Mr. Logan Thigh-bolt. Nobody, but nobody, messed with Keith Clayton, especially not some hippie drifter who thought he could put one over on him. He spent the rest of the afternoon driving the streets of Arden, asking whether anyone had seen him. Dude like that was impossible to miss if only because of Cujo by his side. His search yielded zippo, which only infuriated him further, since he realized that it meant Thigh-bolt had lied to his face and Clayton hadn\u0027t picked up on it. But he\u0027d find the guy. Without a doubt he\u0027d find the guy, if only because of the camera. Or, more accurately, the pictures. Especially the other pictures. Last thing he wanted was for Thigh-bolt to stroll into the sheriffs department and drop that baby on the counter—or even worse, head straight to the newspaper. Of the two, the department would be the lesser of two evils, since his dad could keep a lid on it. While his dad would blow a gasket and most likely put him on some crap detail for the next few weeks, he\u0027d keep it quiet. His dad wasn\u0027t good for much, but he was good for things like that. But the newspaper… now that was a different story. Sure, Gramps would pull some strings and do his best to keep it quiet there, too, but there was no way that sort of information could be kept in check. It was just too juicy, and the news would spread like wildfire through this town, with or without an article. Clay-ton was already regarded as the black sheep of the family, and the last thing he needed was another reason for Gramps to come down on him. Gramps had a way of dwelling on the negative. Even now, years later, Gramps was still bent that he and Beth had divorced, not that it was even his business. And at family gatherings, he could usually be counted on to bring up the fact that Clayton hadn\u0027t gone to college. With his grades, Clayton could easily have handled it, but he simply couldn\u0027t imagine spending another four years in the classroom, so he\u0027d joined his father at the sheriffs department. That was enough to placate Gramps. It seemed like he\u0027d spent half his life placating Gramps. But he had no choice in the matter. Even though he didn\u0027t particularly like Gramps—Gramps was a devout Southern Baptist who went to church every Sunday and thought that drinking and dancing were sins, which always struck Clayton as ridiculous—he knew what Gramps expected of him, and let\u0027s just say that taking nudie pictures of coeds was not on the \"to do\" list. Nor were some of the other photos on the disk, especially of him and a few other ladies in compromising positions. That sort of thing would definitely lead to serious disappointment, and Gramps wasn\u0027t very patient with those who disappointed him, even if they were family. Especially if they were family. Claytons had lived in Hampton County since 1753; in many ways, they were Hampton County. Family members included judges, lawyers, doctors, and landowners; even the mayor had married into the family, but everyone knew Gramps was the one who sat at the head of the table. Gramps ruled the place like an old-fashioned Mafia don, and most people in town sang his praises and went on and on about what a quality man he was. Gramps liked to believe it was because he supported everything from the library to the theater to the local elementary school, but Clayton knew the real reason was that Gramps owned pretty much every commercial building in the downtown area, as well as the lumberyard, both marinas, three automobile dealerships, three storage complexes, the only apartment complex in town, and vast tracts of farmland. All of it made for an immensely wealthy—and powerful—family, and since Clayton got most of his money from the family trusts, the last thing he needed was some stranger in town making trouble for him. Thank God he\u0027d had Ben in the short time he\u0027d been with Beth. Gramps had this weird thing about lineage, and since Ben had been named after Gramps—a pretty slick idea, if he did say so himself—Gramps adored him. Most of the time, Clayton had the sense that Gramps liked Ben, his great-grandson, a lot more than he liked his grandson. Oh, Clayton knew Ben was a good kid. It wasn\u0027t just Gramps— everyone said so. And he did love the kid, even if he was a pain in the ass sometimes. From his perch on the front porch, he looked through the window and saw that Ben had finished with the kitchen and was back on the couch. He knew he should join him inside, but he wasn\u0027t ready just yet. He didn\u0027t want to fly off the handle or say something he\u0027d regret. He\u0027d been working at being better about things like that; a couple of months back, Gramps had had a little talk with him about how important it was to be a steady influence. Peckerhead. What he should have done was talk to Ben about doing what his dad asked when he asked, Clayton thought. Would have done a lot more good. The kid had already pissed him off once tonight, but instead of exploding, he\u0027d remembered Gramps and pressed his lips together before stalking outside. Seemed like he was always getting pissed off at Ben these days. But it wasn\u0027t his fault; he honestly tried to get along with the kid! And they\u0027d started out okay. Talked about school, had some burgers, tuned in to SportsCenter on ESPN. All good. But then, honor of horrors, he\u0027d asked Ben to clean the kitchen. Like that was too much to ask, right? Clayton hadn\u0027t had the chance to get to it for the last few days, and he knew the kid would do a good job. So Ben promised he\u0027d clean it, but instead of doing it, he\u0027d just sat there. And sat. And the clock ticked by. And then he\u0027d sat some more. So Clayton had asked again—he was sure he\u0027d said it nicely—and though he couldn\u0027t be certain, he was pretty sure that Ben had rolled his eyes as he\u0027d finally trudged off. That was all it took. He hated when Ben rolled his eyes at him, and Ben knew he hated it. It was like the kid knew exactly which buttons to push, and he spent all his spare time trying to figure out new buttons to hit the next time he saw him. Hence, Clayton had found himself on the porch. Behaviors like that were his mom\u0027s doing; of that, Clayton had no doubt. She was one hell of a good-looking lady, but she didn\u0027t know the first thing about turning a young boy into a man. He had nothing against the kid getting good grades, but he couldn\u0027t play soccer this year because he wanted to play the violin? What kind of crap was that? Violin? Might as well start dressing the boy in pink and teaching him to ride sidesaddle. Clayton did his best to keep that sort of pansy stuff in check, but the fact was, he had the kid only a day and a half every other weekend. Not his fault the kid swung a bat like a girl. Kid was too busy playing chess. And just so everyone was clear, there was no way on God\u0027s green earth that he\u0027d be caught dead at a violin recital. Violin recital. Good Lord. What was this world coming to? His thoughts circled back to Thigh-bolt again, and though he wanted to believe the guy had simply left the county, he knew better. The guy was walking, and there was no way he could reach the far side of the county by nightfall. And what else? Something had been gnawing at him most of the day, and it wasn\u0027t until he\u0027d come to cool off on the porch that he\u0027d figured it out. If Thigh-bolt had been telling the truth about living in Colorado—and granted, he might not have been, but let\u0027s say he was—it meant he\u0027d been traveling from west to east. And the next town east? Not Arden. That\u0027s for sure. That was southwest from where they\u0027d met. Instead, heading east would have brought the guy to good old Hampton. Right here, his hometown. Which meant, of course, the guy might be less than fifteen minutes from where he was sitting now. But where Was Clayton? Out searching for the guy? No, he was babysitting.\u0027 He squinted through the window again at his son. He was reading on the couch, which was the only thing the kid ever seemed to want to do. Oh yeah, except for the violin. He shook his head, wondering if the kid had gotten any of his genes at all. Not likely. He was a mama\u0027s boy through and through. Beth\u0027s son. Beth… Yeah, the marriage didn\u0027t work. But there was still something between them. There always would be. She may have been preachy and opinionated, but he\u0027d always watch out for her, not only because of Ben, but because she was surely the best-looking woman he\u0027d ever slept with. Great-looking back then and somehow even better-looking now. Even better-looking than the coeds he\u0027d seen today. Weird. Like she had reached an age that suited her perfectly and somehow stopped aging after that. He knew it wouldn\u0027t last. Gravity would take its toll, but still, he couldn\u0027t stop thinking about having a quick roll in the sack with her. One for old times\u0027 sake, and to help him … unwind. He supposed he could call Angie. Or Kate, for that matter. One was twenty and worked in the pet store; the other was a year older and cleaned toilets at the Stratford Inn. They both had nice little figures and were always dynamite when it came time for a little bit of… unwinding. He knew Ben wouldn\u0027t care if he brought one of them over, but even so, he\u0027d probably have to talk to them first. They\u0027d been pretty angry at him the last time he\u0027d seen either of them. He\u0027d have to apologize and turn on the charm, and he wasn\u0027t sure he was up to listening to them smack their chewing gum and chatter away about what they\u0027d seen on MTV or read in the National Enquirer. Sometimes they were too much work. So that was out. Searching for Thigh-bolt tonight was out. Looking for Thigh-bolt tomorrow was out, too, since Gramps wanted everyone over for brunch after church. Still, Thigh-bolt was walking, and with the dog and the backpack, it meant catching a ride was unlikely. How far could he get by tomorrow afternoon ? Twenty miles? Thirty at the most? No more than that, which meant he was still in the vicinity. He\u0027d make some calls to a couple of other departments in the surrounding counties,, ask them to keep an eye out. There weren\u0027t that many roads leading out of the county, and he figured that if he spent a few hours making phone calls to some of the businesses along those routes, someone would spot the guy. When that happened, he\u0027d be on his way. Thigh-bolt never should have messed with Keith Clayton. Lost in thought, Clayton barely heard the front door squeak open. \"Hey, Dad?\" \"Yeah?\" \"Someone\u0027s on the phone.\" \"Who is it?\" \"Tony.\" \"Of course it is.\" He rose from his seat, wondering what Tony wanted. Talk about a loser. Scrawny and pimpled, he was one of those hangers-on who sat near the deputies, trying to worm his way into pretending he was one of them. He was probably wondering where Clayton was and what he was doing later because he didn\u0027t want to be left out. Lame. He finished his beer on the way in and tossed it in the can, listening to it rattle. He grabbed the receiver from the counter. \"Yeah?\" In the background, he could hear the distorted chords of a country-western song playing on a jukebox and the dull roar of loud conversation. He wondered where the loser was calling from. \"Hey, I\u0027m at Decker\u0027s Pool Hall, and there\u0027s this strange dude here that I think you should know about.\" His antenna went up. \"Does he have a dog with him? Backpack? Kind of scruffy, like he\u0027s been out in the woods for a while?\" \"No.\" \"You sure ?\" \"Yeah, I\u0027m sure. He\u0027s shooting pool in the back. But listen. I wanted to tell you he\u0027s got a picture of your ex-wife.\" Caught off guard, Clayton tried to sound nonchalant. \"So?\" he said. \"I just thought you\u0027d want to know.\" \"Why would I give a holy crap about that?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"Of course you don\u0027t. Holler.\" He hung up the phone, thinking the guy must have potato salad where his brains should be, and ran an appraising gaze over the kitchen. Clean as could be. Kid did a great job, as usual. He almost shouted that out from where he stood, but instead, as he caught sight of Ben, he couldn\u0027t help but notice again how small his son was. Granted, a big chunk of that might be genetics, early or late growth spurts, and all that, but another part came from general health. It was common sense. Eat right, exercise, get plenty of rest. The basics; things everyone\u0027s mother told their kids. And mothers were right. If you didn\u0027t eat enough, you couldn\u0027t grow. If you didn\u0027t exercise enough, your muscles stagnated. And when do you think a person grew? Night. When the body regenerated. When people dreamed. He often wondered whether Ben got enough sleep at his mom\u0027s. Clayton knew Ben ate—he\u0027d finished his burger and fries—and he knew the kid was active, so maybe lack of sleep was keeping him small. Kid didn\u0027t want to end up short, did he? Of course not. And besides, Clayton wanted a bit of alone time. Wanted to fantasize about what he was going to do to Thigh-bolt the next time he saw him. He cleared his throat. \"Hey, Ben. It\u0027s getting kind of late, don\u0027t you think?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2101/59629.html","bookId":521,"book":{"id":521,"title":"The Lucky One 幸运符","description":"简介： 《幸运符》是《纽约时报》畅销书排行榜榜首作家爱情小说圣手尼古拉斯斯帕克思最斯帕克思味的真爱之篇，一个男人与死亡擦身而过，命运的力量却引领他找到一生的挚爱。在战火纷飞的伊拉克，前美国海军陆战队队员蒂伯在废墟里捡到一张照片，照片上一个年轻女人微笑着。自此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201804/25/10-42-16-95-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2101","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
