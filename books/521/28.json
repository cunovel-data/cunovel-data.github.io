{"id":27837,"no":28,"title":"Chapter 28 Beth","content":"She could barely see through the windshield, but this time it had less to do with the rain than her inability to concentrate. After Keith had left, she kept blinking in confusion as she stated at the file, trying to make sense of the things her ex had told her. Logan had Drake\u0027s photograph… Logan had become obsessed with her… Logan had decided to seek her out… Logan had hunted her down. She found it hard to breathe, and it had been all she could do to go to the office and tell the principal that she had to go home. The principal had taken one look at her face and agreed, offering to cover her class the rest of the afternoon. Nana would pick up Ben after school, Beth informed him. On the drive home, her mind flashed from one image to the next a kaleidoscope of sight and sound and smell. She tried to convince herself that Keith was lying, grasping for a way to rationalize his news. It was possible, especially considering the way he\u0027d lied in the past, and yet… Keith had been serious. More professional than personal, and J told her something she could easily check. He knew she u d ask Logan about it… he wanted her to ask Logan… which meant.. She squeezed the wheel, possessed by a feverish need to talk to Logan. He would clear this up. He had to be able to clear this up. Water from the river now stretched across the road, but in her preoccupied state, she didn\u0027t realize it until she plowed into the water. She jerked forward as the car almost came to a stop. The river flowed around her, and she thought the water would stall the engine, but the car continued to roll forward into ever deeper water, before finally emerging in a shallower patch. By the time Beth reached the house, she wasn\u0027t even sure what to feel, other than confused. One instant she felt angry and betrayed and manipulated; in the next, she was able to convince herself that it couldn\u0027t be true, that Keith had lied to her again. As she came up the drive, she found herself scanning the rain swept grounds for Logan. Up ahead, through low-hanging mist, she could see lights on in the house. She considered going in to talk to Nana, longing for Nana\u0027s clarity and common sense to straighten everything out. But when she saw the lights on in the office and noted the propped-open door, she felt something catch in her throat. She turned the wheel in the direction of the office, telling herself that Logan didn\u0027t have the picture, that the whole thing had been a mistake. She bounced through muddy puddles, the rain coming so hard now that the wipers couldn\u0027t keep up. On the office porch, she saw Zeus lying near the door, his head raised. She pulled to a stop out front and ran for the porch, rain stinging her face. Zeus approached her, nosing at her hand. She ignored him as she walked inside, expecting to find Logan at the desk. He wasn\u0027t there. The door that led from the office to the kennel stood open. She steeled herself, pausing in the middle of the office, as shadows moved in the darkened corridor. She waited as Logan emerged into the light. \"Hey, Elizabeth,\" he said. \"I didn\u0027t expect to see you …\" He trailed off. \"What happened?\" Staring at him, she felt her emotions threaten to boil over. Her mouth suddenly felt papery dry, and she didn\u0027t know how to start or what to say. Logan said nothing, sensing her volatile state. She closed her eyes, feeling on the verge of tears, then drew a careful breath. \"Why did you come to Hampton?\" she finally asked. \"I want the truth this time.\" He didn\u0027t move. \"I told you the truth,\" he said. \"Did you tell me everything?\" He hesitated for a fraction of a second before answering. \"I\u0027ve never lied to you,\" he said, his voice quiet. \"That\u0027s not what I asked!\" she snapped. \"I asked if you\u0027ve been hiding anything!\" He appraised her carefully. \"Where\u0027s this coming from?\" \"That doesn\u0027t matter!\" This time, she heard the anger in her tone. \"I just want to know why you came to Hampton!\" \"I told you—\" \"Do you have a picture of me?\" Logan said nothing. \"Answer the question!\" She took a step toward him, biting out the words. \"Do you have a picture of me?\" She wasn\u0027t sure how she expected him to react, but other than a soft exhale, he didn\u0027t flinch. \"Yes,\" he said. \"The one I gave Drake?\" \"Yes,\" he said again. With his answer, she felt her whole world begin to topple like a row of dominoes. All at once, everything made sense—the way he\u0027d stared at her when they first met, the reason he was willing to work for such a low wage, why he\u0027d befriended Nana and Ben, and all his talk about destiny… He had the photo. He\u0027d come to Hampton to find her. He\u0027d tracked her down like prey. All at once, it was difficult to breathe. \"Oh, my God.\" \"It\u0027s not what you think——\" He stretched his hand toward her, and she absently watched it draw closer before she finally realized what was happening. With a start, she reeled back, desperate to put more space between them. All of it had been a lie… \"Don\u0027t touch me!\" \"Elizabeth…\" \"My name is Beth!\" She stared at him as if he were a stranger until he lowered his arm. His voice was a whisper when he tried again. \"I can explain—-\" \"Explain what?\" she demanded. \"That you stole the picture from my brother? That you walked across the country to find me? That you fell in love with an image…\" \"It wasn\u0027t like that,\" he said, shaking his head. She didn\u0027t hear him. All she could do was stare at him, wondering if anything he\u0027d said was true. \"You stalked me …\" she said, almost as if talking to herself. \"You lied to me. You used me.\" \"You don\u0027t understand…\" \"Understand? You want me to understand\" \"I didn\u0027t steal the photo,\" he said. His voice remained steady and even. \"I found the photo in Kuwait, and I posted it on a bulletin board where I thought it would be claimed. But no one ever claimed it.\" \"And so… you took it back?\" She shook her head in disbelief. \"Why? Because you had some sick and twisted idea about me?\" \"No,\" he said, his voice rising for the first time. The sound startled her, slowing her thoughts, if only for an instant. \"I came here because I owed you.\" \"You owed me?\" She blinked. \"What does that even mean?\" \"The photo… it saved me.\" Though she heard him plainly, she couldn\u0027t comprehend the words. She waited for more, and in the steady silence that followed, she realized she found them… chilling somehow. The hairs on her arms prickled, and she took another step back. \"Who are you?\" she hissed. \"What do you want from me?\" \"I don\u0027t want anything. And you know who I am.\" \"No, I don\u0027t! I don\u0027t know anything about you!\" \"Let me explain …\" \"Then explain why if this was all so pure and true that you didn\u0027t tell me about the photograph when you first came here!\" she shouted, her voice echoing in the room. In her mind\u0027s eye, she saw Drake and all the details of the night the photo was taken. She pointed a finger at him. \"Why didn\u0027t you say, \u0027I found this in Iraq and I figured you might want it back\u0027? Why didn\u0027t you tell me when we were talking about Drake ?\" \"I don\u0027t know…\" \"It wasn\u0027t your photo to keep! Don\u0027t you get that? It wasn\u0027t meant for you! It was for my brother, not for you! It was his and you had no right to keep it from me!\" Logan\u0027s voice was almost a whisper. \"I didn\u0027t mean to hurt you.\" Her eyes bored into him, piercing him with the force of her rage. \"This whole thing is a sham, isn\u0027t it? You found this photo and came up with some… twisted fantasy in which you could play the starring role. You played me from the moment we met! You took your time to find out what you could do to make it seem like you were the perfect guy for me. And you thought that because you were obsessed with me, you could trick me into falling in love with you.\" She saw Logan flinch at her words, and she went on. \"You planned all this from the very beginning! It\u0027s sick and it\u0027s wrong and I can\u0027t believe I fell for it.\" He rocked back slightly on his heels, stunned by her words. \"I admit that I wanted to meet you,\" he said, \"but you\u0027re wrong about the reason. I didn\u0027t come here to trick you into falling in love with me. I know it sounds crazy, but I came to believe that the photograph kept me safe from harm and that… I owed you somehow, even if I didn\u0027t know what that meant or what would come of it. But I didn\u0027t plan anything after I got here. I took the job, and then I fell in love with you.\" Her expression didn\u0027t soften as he spoke. Instead, she slowly began to shake her head. \"Can you even hear what you\u0027re saying?\" \"I knew you wouldn\u0027t believe it. That\u0027s why I didn\u0027t tell you—\" \"Don\u0027t try to justify your lies! You got caught up in some sick fantasy and you won\u0027t even admit it.\" \"Stop calling it that!\" he shouted back. \"You\u0027re the one who\u0027s not listening. You\u0027re not even trying to understand what I\u0027m saying!\" \"Why should I try to understand? You\u0027ve been lying to me since the beginning. You\u0027ve been using me since the beginning.\" \"I haven\u0027t used you,\" he said, forcing his back straight, regaining his composure. \"And I didn\u0027t lie about the photo. I just didn\u0027t tell you about it because I didn\u0027t know how to tell you in a way that wouldn\u0027t make you think I was crazy.\" She raised her hands. \"Don\u0027t even think of blaming this on me. You\u0027re the one who lied! You\u0027re the one who kept secrets! I told you everything! I gave my heart to you! I let my son become attached to you!\" she shouted. As she went on, her voice broke and she could feel the tears beginning to form. \"I went to bed with you because I thought you were someone I could trust. But now I know that I can\u0027t. Can you imagine how that makes me feel? To know this whole thing was some sort of charade?\" His voice was soft. \"Please, Elizabeth … Beth .;. just listen.\" \"I don\u0027t want to listen! I\u0027ve already been lied to enough.\" \"Don\u0027t be like this.\" \"You want me to listen?\" she screamed. \"Listen to what? That you obsessed over a picture and came to find me because you believe it kept you safe? That\u0027s insane, and the most disturbing thing is, you don\u0027t even recognize that your explanation only makes you sound psychotic!\" He stared at her, and she saw his jaw clench shut. She felt a shudder run through her. She was done with this. Done with him. \"I want it back,\" she gritted out. \"I want the photo that I gave to Drake.\" When he didn\u0027t respond, she reached over to the window ledge and grabbed a small flower pot. She threw it at him, shouting, \"Where is it? I want it!\" Logan ducked as the pot whizzed overhead and crashed into the wall behind him. For the first time, Zeus barked in confusion. \"It\u0027s not yours!\" she shouted. Logan stood straight again. \"I don\u0027t have it.\" \"Where is it?\" she demanded Logan paused before answering. \"I gave it to Ben,\" he admitted. Her eyes narrowed. \"Get out.\" Logan paused before finally moving toward the door. Beth stepped away, keeping her distance from him. Zeus swiveled his gaze from Logan to Beth and back again before padding slowly after Logan. At the door, Logan stopped and turned toward her. \"I swear on my life I didn\u0027t come here to fall in love with you, or try to make you fall in love with me. But I did.\" She stared at him. \"I told you to go and I meant it.\" With that, he turned and strode out into the storm. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2101/59652.html","bookId":521,"book":{"id":521,"title":"The Lucky One 幸运符","description":"简介： 《幸运符》是《纽约时报》畅销书排行榜榜首作家爱情小说圣手尼古拉斯斯帕克思最斯帕克思味的真爱之篇，一个男人与死亡擦身而过，命运的力量却引领他找到一生的挚爱。在战火纷飞的伊拉克，前美国海军陆战队队员蒂伯在废墟里捡到一张照片，照片上一个年轻女人微笑着。自此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201804/25/10-42-16-95-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2101","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
