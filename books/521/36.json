{"id":27845,"no":36,"title":"Chapter 36 Beth","content":"As fate would have it, Nana was in the kennel office when Keith stormed into the house and closed the door behind him, acting as if he owned the place. Even from the kitchen, Beth could see the veins on his neck protruding. His hands balled into fists when his eyes locked on hers. When he marched through the living room, Beth felt some\u0027 thing give way inside her; fear filled its place. Never once had she seen him like this, and she backed away, following the angles of the cabinets. Keith surprised her by stopping at the entrance to the kitchen. He smiled, but his expression was off somehow, a grotesque and demented caricature of what it was supposed to be. \"Sorry for barging in like this,\" he said with exaggerated courtesy, \"but we need to talk.\" \"What are you doing here? You can\u0027t just walk in here—\" \"Cooking dinner, huh?\" he said. \"I remember when you used to cook dinner for me.\" \"Get out, Keith,\" she said, her voice hoarse. \"I\u0027m not going anywhere,\" he said, looking at her as if she didn\u0027t know what she was talking about. He motioned toward the chair. \"Why don\u0027t you sit down?\" \"I don\u0027t want to sit down,\" she whispered, hating how frightened she sounded. \"I want you to leave.\" \"That\u0027s not going to happen,\" he said. He smiled again, but It was no better than his first attempt. There was a vacancy in his gaze she\u0027d never seen before. She felt her heartbeat speed up. \"Would you get me a beer, please?\" he asked. \"It\u0027s been a long day at the office, if you know what I mean.\" She swallowed, afraid to look away. \"I don\u0027t have any more.\" He nodded, glancing around the kitchen before fixing his gaze on her again. He pointed. \"I see one right there, by the stove. There\u0027s got to be another one somewhere. You mind if I check the fridge?\" He didn\u0027t wait for an answer. He walked to the fridge and opened it before reaching for the bottom shelf. He came out with a bottle. \"Found one,\" he crowed. He looked at her as he opened it. \"Guess you were mistaken, huh?\" He took a long pull and winked. She forced herself to stay calm. \"What do you want, Keith?\" \"Oh, you know. Just wanted to catch up. See if there\u0027s anything I should know.\" \"Know about what?\" she asked, her stomach clenching. \"About Thigh-bolt,\" he said. She ignored the mangling of the name. \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about.\" He took another drink, swishing the beer in his mouth as he nodded. He swallowed, the sound loud. \"Driving over here, that\u0027s what I thought you might say,\" he said, sounding almost conversational. \"But I know you better than you think I do.\" He gestured at her with his beer bottle. \"There was a time there when I wasn\u0027t sure I knew you at all, but that\u0027s changed in the past few years. Raising a son together really bonds a couple, don\u0027t you think?\" She didn\u0027t respond. \"That\u0027s why I\u0027m here, you know. Because of Ben. Because I want the best for him, and right now, I\u0027m not sure you\u0027re thinking all that clearly about things.\" He stepped toward her and took another long pull of his beer. The bottle was already nearly empty. He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand before going on. \"See, I\u0027ve been thinking that you and I haven\u0027t always had the best relationship. That\u0027s not good for Ben. He needs to know that we still get along. That we\u0027re still close friends. Don\u0027t you think that\u0027s an important lesson to teach him? That even if your parents get divorced, they can still be friends?\" She didn\u0027t like the sound of his rambling monologue, but she was afraid to cut him off. This was a different Keith Clayton… a dangerous one. \"I think it\u0027s important,\" he continued. He took another step toward her. \"In fact, I can\u0027t think of anything more important.\" \"Just stay back,\" she said. \"I don\u0027t think so,\" he scolded her. \"You haven\u0027t been thinking all that clearly in the last couple of days.\" As he neared, she slid farther down the bank of counters, trying to keep him in front of her. \"Don\u0027t come any closer. I\u0027m warning you.\" He kept closing the distance, staring at her with those vacant eyes. \"See what I mean? You\u0027re acting like you think I\u0027m going to hurt you. I\u0027d never, ever hurt you. You should know that about me.\" \"You\u0027re crazy.\" \"No, I\u0027m not. A little angry, maybe, but not crazy.\" When he smiled again, the vacancy in his eyes vanished and her stomach did a flip-flop. He went on. \"Do you know that even after all you\u0027ve put me through, I still think you\u0027re beautiful?\" She didn\u0027t like where this was going. Not at all. By then, she\u0027d reached the corner, with no place left to go. \"Just leave, okay! Ben\u0027s upstairs and Nana will be back in a minute—\" \"All I want is a kiss. Is that such a big deal?\" She wasn\u0027t sure she\u0027d heard him right. \"A kiss?\" she parroted. \"For now,\" he said. \"That\u0027s all. Just for old times\u0027 sake. Then I\u0027ll go. I\u0027ll walk right out of here. I promise.\" \"I\u0027m not going to kiss you,\" she said, stunned. By then, he was standing before her. \"You will,\" he said. \"And you\u0027ll do more, later. But for now, a kiss is fine.\" She arched her back, trying to keep away. \"Please, Keith. I don\u0027t want this. I don\u0027t want to kiss you.\" \u0027You\u0027ll get over it,\" he said. When he leaned in, she turned away. He took hold of her upper arms. As he moved his lips toward her ear, Beth could feel her heart begin to hammer. \"You\u0027re hurting me!\" she gasped. \"Here\u0027s the thing, Beth,\" he whispered. She could feel the warmth of his breath on her neck. \"If you don\u0027t want to kiss me, that\u0027s fine. I\u0027ll accept that. But I\u0027ve decided that I want to be a little more than friends.\" \"Get out!\" she hissed, and with a laugh, Keith let her go. \"Sure,\" he said. He took a step back. \"No problem. I\u0027ll leave. But I should let you know what\u0027s going to happen if we don\u0027t work something out.\" \"Just leave!\" she shouted. \"I think we should go on a… date every now and then. And I\u0027m not going to take no for an answer.\" The way he said \"date\" made her skin crawl. Beth couldn\u0027t believe what she was hearing. \"After all, I warned you about Thigh-bolt,\" he added, \"but where were you today? At his place.\" He shook his head. \"That was a big mistake. You see, it\u0027s pretty easy for me to make a case that he stalked you and that he\u0027s obsessive. Both of those things make him dangerous, but you\u0027re obviously ignoring it. And that makes it dangerous for Ben to be forced to live with you.\" His expression was neutral. Beth was paralyzed by his words. \"I\u0027d hate to have to go to the courts and tell them what you\u0027re doing, but I will. And I\u0027m sure they\u0027ll grant me full Custody this time.” \"You wouldn\u0027t,\" she whispered. \"I will Unless.\" His obvious enjoyment as he spoke made it, much more horrifying. He paused, letting it sink in, before speaking like a professor again. \"Let me make sure you understand. First, you tell Thigh-bolt that you never want to see him again. Then you ask him to leave town. And after that, we\u0027ll go out. For old times\u0027 sake. It\u0027s either that, or Ben\u0027s going to live with me.\" \"I\u0027m not going to live with you!\" a small voice shouted from the kitchen doorway. Beth looked past Keith to see Ben, his expression horrified. Ben started to back away. \"I\u0027m not going to do it!\" Ben turned and ran, slamming the front door behind htm as he raced into the storm. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2101/59660.html","bookId":521,"book":{"id":521,"title":"The Lucky One 幸运符","description":"简介： 《幸运符》是《纽约时报》畅销书排行榜榜首作家爱情小说圣手尼古拉斯斯帕克思最斯帕克思味的真爱之篇，一个男人与死亡擦身而过，命运的力量却引领他找到一生的挚爱。在战火纷飞的伊拉克，前美国海军陆战队队员蒂伯在废墟里捡到一张照片，照片上一个年轻女人微笑着。自此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201804/25/10-42-16-95-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2101","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
