{"id":27823,"no":14,"title":"Chapter 14 Clayton","content":"Of all the places in all the world, he had to find the guy at Beth\u0027s place. What were the odds on that? Pretty damn small, that\u0027s for sure. He hated that guy. No, scratch that. He wanted to destroy the guy. Not only because of the whole stealing-the-camera-and-flattening-his-tires thing, though that was definitely worthy of a little time locked in the jail alongside a couple of violent meth-amphetamine addicts. And it wasn\u0027t because Thigh-bolt had him over a barrel with the camera disk. It was because the guy, the same guy who\u0027d played him once, had made him look like a quivering jellyfish in front of Beth. If I were you, I\u0027d let go of her arm had been bad enough. But after that? Oh, that\u0027s where the guy went seriously wrong. Right now. … I think you\u0027d better go… All spoken in that serious, steady, don\u0027t-piss-me-off tone of voice that Clayton himself used °n criminals. And he\u0027d actually done it, slinking away like some stray dog with his tail between his legs, which made the whole thing worse. Normally, he wouldn\u0027t have put up with that for a second, even with Beth and Ben around. No one gave him orders and got away with it, and he would have made it perfectly clear that the guy had just made the biggest mistake of his life. But he couldn\u0027t! That was the thing. He couldn\u0027t. Not with Cujo around, eyeballing his crotch like it was an appetizer at the Sunday buffet. In the dark, the thing actually looked like a rabid wolf, and all he could do was remember the stories Kenny Moore told him about Panther. What the hell was he doing with Beth, anyway? How did that come about? It was like some sort of evil cosmic plan to ruin what had been for the most part a pretty crappy day—starting with mopey, moody Ben showing up at noon and complaining straight off about having to take out the garbage. He was a patient guy, but he was tired of the kid\u0027s attitude. Real tired of it, which was why he hadn\u0027t let Ben stop at just the garbage. He\u0027d had the kid clean the kitchen and the bathrooms, too, thinking it would show him how the real world worked, where having a halfway decent attitude actually mattered. Power of positive thinking and all that. And besides, everyone knew that while mamas did the spoiling, dads were supposed to teach kids that nothing in life was free, right? And the kid did real well with the cleaning, like he always did, so for Clayton the whole thing was over and done with. It was time for a break, so he took Ben outside to play catch. What kid wouldn\u0027t want to play catch with his dad on a beautiful Saturday afternoon? Ben. That\u0027s who. I\u0027m tired. It\u0027s realty hot, Dad. Do we have to? One stupid complaint after the other until they finally get outside, and then the kid shuts up tighter than a clam and won\u0027t say a thing. Worse, no matter how many times Clayton told him to watch the damn ball, the kid kept missing it because he wasn\u0027t even trying. Doing it on purpose, no doubt. But would he run to the ball after he missed it? Of course not. Not his kid. His kid is too busy sulking about the unfairness of it all while playing catch like a blind man. In the end, it pissed him off. He was trying to have a good time with his son, but his son was working against him, and yeah, okay, maybe he did throw the ball a little hard that last time. But what happened next wasn\u0027t his fault. If the kid had been paying attention, the ball wouldn\u0027t have ricocheted off his glove and Ben wouldn\u0027t have ended up screaming like a baby, like he was dying or something. Like he was the only kid in the history of the world to get a shiner playing ball. But all that was beside the point. The kid got hurt. It wasn\u0027t serious, and the bruises would be gone in a couple of weeks. In a year, Ben would either forget it completely or brag to his friends about the time he got a shiner playing ball. Beth, on the other hand, would never forget. She\u0027d carry that grudge around inside her for a long, long time, even if it had been mote Ben\u0027s fault than his. She didn\u0027t understand the simple fact that all boys remembered their sports injuries with pride. He\u0027d known Beth would overreact tonight, but he didn\u0027t necessarily blame her for it. That\u0027s what mothers did, and Clayton had been prepared for that. He thought he\u0027d handled the whole thing pretty well, right up until the end, when he\u0027d seen the guy with the dog sitting on the porch like he owned the place. Logan Thigh-bolt. He remembered the name right off, of course. He\u0027d searched for the guy for a few days without luck and had pretty much put it behind him when he figured the guy had left town. No way some dude and his dog couldn\u0027t be noticed, right? Which was why he\u0027d eventually stopped asking folks whether they\u0027d seen him. Stupid. But what to do now? What was he going to do about this … new turn of events? He\u0027d deal with Logan Thigh-bolt, that much was certain, and he wasn\u0027t about to be caught off guard again. Which meant that before he did anything, he needed information. Where the guy lived, where the guy worked, where he liked to hang out. Where he could find the guy alone. Harder than it sounded, especially with the dog. He had the funny feeling Thigh-bolt and the dog were seldom, if ever, separated. But he\u0027d figure out what to do about that, too. Obviously, he needed to know what was going on with Beth and Thigh-bolt. He hadn\u0027t heard about her seeing anyone since Adam the dork. It was hard to believe that Beth could be seeing Thigh-bolt, considering the fact that he always heard what Beth was up to. Frankly, he couldn\u0027t imagine what she\u0027d see in some-one like Thigh-bolt in the first place. She\u0027d gone to college; the last thing she wanted in her life was some drifter who rolled into town. The guy didn\u0027t even have a car. But Thigh-bolt had been with her on a Saturday night, and that obviously counted for something. Somewhere, something didn\u0027t make sense. He pondered it, wondering if the guy worked there… Either way, he\u0027d figure it out, and when he did, he\u0027d deal with it, and Mr. Logan Thigh-bolt would find himself hating the day he\u0027d ever showed up in Clayton\u0027s town.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2101/59638.html","bookId":521,"book":{"id":521,"title":"The Lucky One 幸运符","description":"简介： 《幸运符》是《纽约时报》畅销书排行榜榜首作家爱情小说圣手尼古拉斯斯帕克思最斯帕克思味的真爱之篇，一个男人与死亡擦身而过，命运的力量却引领他找到一生的挚爱。在战火纷飞的伊拉克，前美国海军陆战队队员蒂伯在废墟里捡到一张照片，照片上一个年轻女人微笑着。自此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201804/25/10-42-16-95-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2101","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
