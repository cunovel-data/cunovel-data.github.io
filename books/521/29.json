{"id":27838,"no":29,"title":"Chapter 29 Thibault","content":"Despite the rain, Thibault couldn\u0027t imagine going back to his house. He wanted to be outside; it didn\u0027t feel right to be warm and dry. He wanted to purge himself of what he had done, of all the lies he had told. She\u0027d been right: He hadn\u0027t been honest with her. Despite the hurt he felt at some of the things she\u0027d said and her unwillingness to listen, she had been justified in feeling betrayed. But how to explain? He didn\u0027t fully understand why he\u0027d come, even when he tried to put it into words. He could see why she interpreted his actions as those of an obsessed madman. And, yes, he was obsessed, just not in the way she imagined. He should have told her about the photograph as soon as he\u0027d arrived, and he struggled to remember why he hadn\u0027t done so. Odds were, she would have been surprised and asked a few questions, but it would have ended at that. He suspected that Nana would have hired him anyway, and then none of this would have happened. More than anything, he wanted to turn around and go back to her. He wanted to explain, to tell his whole story from the beginning. He wouldn\u0027t, though. She needed time alone-or at least time from him- Time to recover and maybe, just maybe, understand that the Thibault she\u0027d come to care for was the only Thibault there was. He wondered whether time alone would bring forgiveness. Thibault sank in the mud; he noted as a car passed slowly that the water reached its axles. Up ahead, he saw the river stretching across the road. He decided to cut through the woods. Perhaps this would be the last time he would make this walk. Perhaps it t was time to return to Colorado. Thibault moved forward. The autumn foliage, still hanging on provided partial cover from the rain, and as he walked deeper into the woods, he felt the distance between them grow with each step he took.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2101/59653.html","bookId":521,"book":{"id":521,"title":"The Lucky One 幸运符","description":"简介： 《幸运符》是《纽约时报》畅销书排行榜榜首作家爱情小说圣手尼古拉斯斯帕克思最斯帕克思味的真爱之篇，一个男人与死亡擦身而过，命运的力量却引领他找到一生的挚爱。在战火纷飞的伊拉克，前美国海军陆战队队员蒂伯在废墟里捡到一张照片，照片上一个年轻女人微笑着。自此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201804/25/10-42-16-95-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2101","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
