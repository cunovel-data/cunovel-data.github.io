{"id":27822,"no":13,"title":"Chapter 13 Thibault","content":"Thibault watched as Victor cast his line into the cool Minnesota water. It was a cloudless Saturday morning. The air was still, the lake mirroring the pristine skies. They had set out on the lake early, wanting to fish before it became crowded with Jet Skis and speedboats. It was their last day of vacation; tomorrow, both were scheduled to fly out. For their final evening, they planned to eat at a local steak house they\u0027d heard was the best in town. \"I think you\u0027ll be able to find this woman,\" Victor announced without preamble. Thibault was reeling in his own line. \"Who?\" \"The woman in the photo who brings you luck.\" Thibault squinted at his friend. \"What are you talking about?\" \"When you look for her. I think you\u0027ll be able to find her.\" Thibault inspected his hook carefully and cast again. \"I\u0027m not going to look for her.\" \"So you say now. But you will.\" Thibault shook his head. \"No, I won\u0027t. And even if I wanted too, there\u0027s no way I could.\" \"you\u0027ll find a way.\" Victor sounded smug in his certainty. Thibault stared at his friend. \"Why are we even talking about this?\" \"Because,\" Victor pronounced, \"it\u0027s not over yet.\" \"Believe me, it\u0027s over.\" \"I know you think so. But it isn\u0027t.\" Thibault had learned long ago that once Victor started on a topic, he would continue to expound on it until he was satisfied he\u0027d made his point. Because it wasn\u0027t the way Thibault wanted to spend their last day, he figured he might as well get it over with once and for all. \"Okay,\" he said, sighing. \"Why isn\u0027t it over?\" Victor shrugged. \"Because there is no balance.\" \"No balance,\" Thibault repeated, his tone flat. \"Yes,\" Victor said. \"Exactly. You see?\" \"No.\" Victor groaned at Thibault\u0027s denseness. \"Say someone comes to put a roof on your house. The man works hard, and at the end, he is paid. Only then is it over. But in this case, with the photograph, it is as if the roof has been put on, but the owner has not paid. Until payment is made, everything is out of balance.\" \"Are you saying that I owe this woman something?\" Thibault\u0027s voice was skeptical. \"Yes. The photo kept you safe and brought you luck. But until payment is made, it is not over.\" Thibault reached for a soda in the cooler. He handed one to Victor. \"You do realize you sound insane.\" Victor accepted the can with a nod. \"To some, maybe. But eventually, you will look for her. There is a greater purpose to all this. It is your destiny.\" \"My destiny.\" \"Yes.\" \"What does that mean?\" \"I don\u0027t know. But you will know it when you get there.\" Thibault stayed quiet, wishing Victor had never brought up the subject. In the silence, Victor studied his friend. \"Maybe,\" he speculated, \"you\u0027re meant to be together.\" \"I\u0027m not in love with her, Victor.\" \"No?\" \"No,\" he said. \"And yet,\" Victor observed, \"you think about her often.\" to this, Thibault said nothing, for there was nothing he could say. On Saturday morning, Thibault arrived early and went straight to work at the kennels, feeding, cleaning, and training as usual. While he worked, Ben played with Zeus until Elizabeth called him inside to get ready to go. She waved from her spot on the porch, but even from a distance, he could see she was distracted. She had gone back inside by the time he took the dogs out; he usually walked them in groups of three, with Zeus trailing behind him. Away from the house, he would let the dogs off the leash, but they tended to follow behind him no matter what direction he headed. He liked to vary the route he took; the variety kept the dogs from wandering too far away. Like people, dogs got bored if they did the same thing every day. Usually, the walks lasted about thirty minutes per group. After the third group, he noticed that Elizabeth\u0027s car was gone, and he assumed she\u0027d gone to drop Ben off at his father\u0027s. He didn\u0027t like Ben\u0027s father, mostly because Ben and Elizabeth didn\u0027t. The guy sounded like a piece of work, but it wasn\u0027t his place to do much more than listen when she talked about him. He didn\u0027t bow enough to offer any advice, and even if he did, she wasn\u0027t asking for any. In any event, it wasn\u0027t his business. But what was his business, then? Why was he here? Despite himself, his thoughts drifted back to his conversation with Victor, and he knew he was here because of what Victor had said to him that morning at the lake. And, of course, because of what happened later. He forced the memory away. He wasn\u0027t going to go there. Not again. Calling to the dogs, Thibault turned and made for the kennels. After putting the dogs away, he went to explore the storage shed, When he turned on die light in the shed, he stared at the walls and shelves in amazement. Elizabeth\u0027s grandfather didn\u0027t have just a few tools—the place resembled a cluttered hardware store. He wandered inside, scanning the racks and sorting through the Snap-on tool cabinets and piles of items on the workbench. He eventually picked out a socket wrench set, a couple of adjustable and Allen wrenches, and a jack and carried them out to the truck. As Elizabeth had promised, the keys were under the mat. Thibault drove down the driveway, heading for the auto supply store he vaguely remembered seeing near downtown. The parts were in stock—replacement pads, C-clamp, and some high-temp grease—and he was back at the house in less than half an hour. He put the jack in place and raised the car, then removed the first wheel. He retracted the piston with the C-clamp, removed the old pad, checked the rotors for damage, and reinstalled a new pad before replacing the wheel and repeating the process with the other wheels. He was finishing the third brake pad when he heard Elizabeth pull up, rolling to a stop next to the old truck. He glanced over his shoulder just as she got out, realizing she\u0027d been gone for hours. \"How\u0027s it going?\" she asked. \"Just about done.\" \"Really?\" She sounded amazed. \"It\u0027s just brake pads. It\u0027s not a big deal.\" \"I\u0027m sure that\u0027s the same thing a surgeon would say. It\u0027s just an appendix.\" \"You want to learn?\" Thibault asked, staring up at her figure silhouetted against the sky. \"How long does it take?\" \"Not long.\" He shrugged. \"Ten minutes?\" \"Really?\" she repeated. \"Okay. Just let me get the groceries inside.\" \"Need help?\" \"No, it\u0027s just a couple of bags.\" He slipped the third wheel back on and finished tightening the lug nuts before moving to the final wheel. He loosened the nuts just as Elizabeth reached his side. When she squatted beside him, he could smell a hint of the coconut lotion she\u0027d applied earlier that morning. \"First, you take the wheel off…he began, and methodically walked her through the process, making sure she understood each step. When he lowered the jack and started to collect the tools, she shook her head. \"That seemed almost too easy. I think even I could do it.\" \"Probably.\" \"Then why do they charge so much?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"I\u0027m in the wrong line of work,\" she said, rising and gathering her hair into a loose ponytail. \"But thank you for taking care of it. I\u0027ve wanted those fixed for a while now.\" \"No problem.\" \"Are you hungry? I picked up some fresh turkey for sandwiches. And some pickles.\" \"That sounds delicious,\" he said. They had lunch on the back porch, overlooking the garden. Elizabeth still seemed distracted, but they chatted a little about what it was like to grow up in a small southern town, where everyone knew everything about everybody else. Some of the stories were amusing, but Thibault admitted that he preferred a more anonymous existence. \"Why am I not surprised?\" she asked. Afterward, Thibault went back to work while Elizabeth spent the afternoon cleaning the house. Unlike her grandfather, Thibault was able to pry open the office window that had been painted shut, though it turned out to be more difficult than fixing the brakes. Nor was it easy to open or close afterward, no matter how much sanding he did to smooth it. Then, he painted the trim. After that, it was a normal workday. By the time he finished up his duties at the kennel, it was coming up on five, and though he could have easily left for the day, he didn\u0027t. Instead, he began work on the files again, wanting to get a head start on what he knew would be a long day tomorrow. He settled in for the next couple of hours, making what he thought was headway— who could tell, though?—and didn\u0027t hear Elizabeth approach. Instead, he noticed Zeus get to his feet and start toward the door. \"I\u0027m surprised you\u0027re still here,\" she said from the doorway. \"I saw the light on and thought you\u0027d forgotten to turn it off.\" \"I wouldn\u0027t forget.\" She pointed to the stacks of files on the desk. \"I can\u0027t tell you how glad I am that you\u0027re doing that. Nana tried to talk me into organizing the files this summer, but I was extremely adept at put\u0027 ting her off.\" \"Lucky me,\" he drawled. \"No, lucky me. I almost feel guilty about it.\" \"I\u0027d almost believe you, except for that smirk. Have you heard from Ben or Nana?\" \"Both,\" she said. \"Nana\u0027s great, Ben is miserable. Not that he said as much. I could hear it in his voice.\" \"I\u0027m sorry,\" he said, meaning it. She offered a tense shrug before reaching for the door handle. She rotated it in both directions, seemingly interested in the mechanism. Finally, she let out a sigh. \"Do you want to help me make some ice cream?\" \"Excuse me?\" He set down the file he\u0027d been labeling. \"I love homemade ice cream. There\u0027s nothing better when it\u0027s hot, but it\u0027s no fun to make if you can\u0027t share it with someone.\" \"I don\u0027t know if I\u0027ve ever had homemade ice cream…\" \"Then you don\u0027t know what you\u0027re missing. You in?\" Her childlike enthusiasm was contagious. \"Yeah, okay,\" he agreed. \"That sounds fun.\" \"Let me run to the store and get what we need. I\u0027ll be back in a few minutes.\" \"Wouldn\u0027t it be easier just to buy some ice cream?\" Her eyes shone with delight. \"But it\u0027s not the same. You\u0027ll see. I\u0027ll be back in a few minutes, okay?\" She was as good as her word. Thibault just had time to straighten up the desk and check on the dogs one last time before he heard her coming up the drive on her way back from the store. He met her as she was getting out of the car. \"Would you mind bringing in the bag of crushed ice?\" she asked. \"It\u0027s in the backseat.\" He followed her into the kitchen with the bag of ice, and she motioned to the freezer as she set a quart of half-and-half on the counter. \"Can you get the ice-cream maker? It\u0027s in the pantry. Top shelf on the left.\" Thibault emerged from the pantry with a crank-handled icecream maker that looked to be at least fifty years old. \"Is this the one?\" \"Yeah, that\u0027s it.\" \"Does it still work?\" he wondered aloud. \"Perfectly. Amazing, isn\u0027t it? Nana got that as a gift for her wedding, but we still use it all the time. It makes delicious ice cream.\" He brought it over to the counter and stood beside her. \"What can I do?\" \"If you agree to crank, I\u0027ll do the mixing.\" \"Fair enough,\" he said. She dug out an electric mixer and a bowl, along with a measuring cup. From the spice cabinet, she chose sugar, flour, and vanilla extract. She added three cups of sugar and a cup of flour to the bowl and mixed it by hand, then put the bowl on the mixer. Next, she beat in three eggs, all the half-and-half, and three teaspoons of vanilla extract before turning on the mixer. Finally, she splashed in a bit of milk and poured the entire mixture into the cream can, put the can in the ice-cream maker, and surrounded it with crushed ice and rock salt. \"We\u0027re ready,\" she announced, handing it to him. She picked up the rest of the ice and the rock salt. \"To the porch we go. You have to make it on the porch, or it isn\u0027t the same.\" \"Ah,\"h e said. She took a seat beside him on the porch steps, sitting fraction\u0027 ally closer than she had the day before. Wedging the can between his feet, Thibault began to rotate the crank, surprised at how easily it turned. \"Thanks for doing this,\" she said. \"I really need the ice cream. It\u0027s been one of those days.\" \"Yeah?\" She turned toward him, a sly smile playing on her lips. \"You\u0027re very good at that.\" \"What?\" \"Saying, \u0027Yeah?\u0027 when someone makes a comment. It\u0027s just enough to make someone keep talking without being too personal or prying.\" \"Yeah?\" She giggled. \"Yeah,\" she mimicked. \"But most people would have said something like, \u0027What happened?\u0027 Or, \u0027Why?\u0027\" \"All right. What happened? Why was it one of those days?\" She gave a disgusted snort. \"Oh, it\u0027s just that Ben was really grumpy this morning while he was packing, and I ended up snap-ping at him to hurry up because he was taking so long. His dad usually doesn\u0027t like it when he\u0027s late, but today? Well, today, it was as if he\u0027d forgotten that Ben was even coming. I must have knocked on the door for a couple of minutes before he eventually opened it, and I could tell he\u0027d just gotten out of bed. Had I known he was sleeping in, I wouldn\u0027t have been so hard on Ben, and I still feel guilty about it. And, of course, as I\u0027m pulling away, see Ben already hauling out the garbage because dear old Dad was too lazy to do it. And then, of course, I spent the whole day cleaning, which wasn\u0027t so bad the first couple of hours. But by the end, I really needed ice cream.\" \"Doesn\u0027t sound like a relaxing Saturday.\" \"It wasn\u0027t,\" she muttered, and he could tell she was debating whether to say more. There was something more, something else bothering her, and she drew a long breath before sighing. \"It\u0027s my brother\u0027s birthday today,\" she said, the faintest tremor in her voice. \"That\u0027s where I went today, after dropping Ben off. I brought flowers to the cemetery.\" Thibault felt a thickness in his throat as he remembered the photograph on the mantel. Though he\u0027d suspected that her brother had been killed, it was the first time that either Nana or Elizabeth had confirmed it. He immediately understood why she hadn\u0027t wanted to be alone tonight. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" he said, meaning it. \"So am I,\" she said. \"You would have liked him. Everyone liked him.\" \"I\u0027m sure.\" She twisted her hands in her lap. \"It slipped Nana\u0027s mind. Of course, she remembered this afternoon and called to tell me how sorry she was that she couldn\u0027t be here. She was practically in tears, but I told her it was okay. That it wasn\u0027t a big deal.\" \"It is a big deal. He was your brother and you miss him.\" A wistful smile flickered across her face, then faded away. \"You remind me of him,\" she offered, her voice soft \"Not so much in your appearance, but in your mannerisms. I noticed that the first time you walked in the office to apply for the job. It\u0027s like you two were stamped out of the same mold. I guess it\u0027s a marine thing, huh?\" \"Maybe,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve met all types.\" \"I\u0027ll bet.\" She paused, drawing her knees to her chest and wrapping her arms around them. \"Did you like it? Being in the marines?\" \"Sometimes.\" \"But not all the time?\" \"No.\" \"Drake loved it. Loved everything about it, in fact.\" Though she seemed mesmerized by the movement of the crank, Thibault could tell she was lost in her memories. \"I remember when the invasion began. With Camp Lejeune less than an hour away, it was big news. I was scared for him, especially when I heard talk about chemical weapons and suicide stands, but do you want to know what he was worried about? Before the invasion, I mean?\" \"What?\" \"A picture. A dumb old photograph. Can you believe that?\" The unexpected words made Thibault\u0027s heart suddenly hammer in his chest, but he forced himself to appear calm. \"He took this picture of me when we first arrived at the fair that year,\" she said, going on. \"It was the last weekend we spent together before he joined, and after we made the usual rounds, we just kind of wandered off to be alone. I remember sitting with him near this giant pine tree and talking for hours as we watched the Ferris wheel. It was one of the big ones, all lit up, and we could hear kids oohing and aahing as it went round and round under this perfect summer sky. We talked about our mom and dad, and we wondered what they would have been like or whether they\u0027d have gray hair or whether we would have stayed in Hampton or moved away, and I remember looking up at the sky. All of a sudden, this shooting star went by, and all I could think was that they were listening to us somehow.\" She paused, lost in the memory, before going on. \"He had the picture laminated and kept it with him all through basic training. After he got to Iraq, he e-mailed me and told me that he\u0027d lost it, and asked if I could send him another one. It seemed kind of crazy to me, but I wasn\u0027t there, and I didn\u0027t know what he was going through, so I said I\u0027d send another one. But I didn\u0027t get around to sending it right away. Don\u0027t ask me why. It was like I had some sort of mental block against doing it. I mean, I\u0027d put the disk Into my purse, but every time I was near the drugstore, I\u0027d just forget to get the photograph developed. And before I knew it, the invasion had started. I finally got around to sending it, but the letter was eventually returned to me unopened. Drake died in the first week of the invasion.\" She stared at him over the tops of her knees. \"Five days. That was how long he lasted. And I never got him the one thing he wanted from me. You know how that makes me feel?\" Thibault felt sick to his stomach. \"I don\u0027t know what to say.\" \"There\u0027s nothing you can say,\" she said. \"It\u0027s just one of those terrible, impossibly sad things. And now … today, I kept thinking that he\u0027s just slipping away. Nana didn\u0027t remember, Ben didn\u0027t remember. At least with Ben, I can sort of understand it. He wasn\u0027t even five when Drake was killed, and you know how memories are at that age. Only a little bit sticks. But Drake was so good with him because he actually enjoyed being around him.\" She shrugged. \"Kind of like you.\" Thibault wished she hadn\u0027t said it. He didn\u0027t belong here____ \"I didn\u0027t want to hire you,\" she continued, oblivious to Thibault\u0027s turmoil. \"Did you know that?\" \"Yes.\" \"But not because you walked here from Colorado. That was part of it, but it was mainly because you\u0027d been in the marines.\" He nodded, and in the silence she reached for the ice-cream maker. \"It probably needs some more ice,\" she said. She opened the lid, added more ice, and then handed it back to him. \"Why are you here?\" she finally asked. Though he knew what she really meant, he pretended he didn\u0027t. \"Because you asked me to stay.\" \"I mean, why are you here in Hampton? And I want the truth this time.\" He grasped for the right explanation. \"It seemed like a nice place, and so far, it has been.\" He could tell by her expression that she knew there was more, and she waited. When he didn\u0027t add anything else, she frowned. \"It has something to do with your time in Iraq, doesn\u0027t it? His silence gave him away. \"How long were you there?\" she asked. He shifted in his seat, not wanting to talk about it but knowing he had no choice. \"Which time?\" \"How many times did you go?\" \"Three.\" \"Did you see a lot of combat?\" \"Yes.\" \"But you made it out.\" Yes. Her lips tightened, and she suddenly looked on the verge of tears. \"Why you and not my brother?\" He turned the crank four times before answering with what he knew was a lie. \"I don\u0027t know.\" When Elizabeth got up to get bowls and spoons for the ice cream, Thibault fought the urge to call Zeus and simply leave, right then, before he changed his mind, and go back home to Colorado. He couldn\u0027t stop thinking about the photograph in his pocket, the photograph that Drake had lost. Thibault had found it, Drake had died, and now he was here, in the home where Drake had been raised, spending time with the sister he\u0027d left behind. On the surface, it was all so improbable, but as he fought the sudden dryness in his mouth, he concentrated on those things he knew to be true. The photograph was simply that: a picture of Elizabeth that her brother had taken. There were no such things as lucky charms. Thibault had survived his time in Iraq, but so had the vast majority of marines who\u0027d been posted there. So, in fact, had most of his platoon, including Victor. But some marines had died, Drake among them, and though it was tragic, it had nothing to do with the photograph. It was war. As for him, he was here because he\u0027d made a decision to search for the woman in the picture. It had nothing to do with destiny or magic. But he\u0027d! searched because of Victor… He blinked and reminded himself that he didn\u0027t believe anything Victor had told him. What Victor believed was just superstition. It couldn\u0027t be true. At least not all of it. Zeus seemed to sense his struggle and lifted his head to stare. With his ears raised, he gave a soft whine and wandered up the stairs to lick Thibault\u0027s hand. Thibault raised Zeus\u0027s head, and the dog nuzzled his face. \"What am I doing here?\" Thibault whispered. \"Why did I come?\" As he waited for an answer that would never come, he heard the screen door slam behind him. \"Are you talking to yourself or to your dog?\" Elizabeth asked. \"Both,\" he said. She sat next to him and handed him his spoon. \"What were you saying?\" \"Nothing important,\" he said. He motioned for Zeus to lie down, and the dog squished himself onto the step in an attempt to remain close to both of them. Elizabeth opened the ice-cream maker and scooped some ice cream into each of the bowls. \"I hope you like it,\" she said, handing him a bowl. She dipped her spoon in and had a taste before turning toward him, her expression earnest. \"I want to apologize,\" she said. \"For what?\" \"For what I said before … When I asked why you made it and my brother didn\u0027t.\" \"It\u0027s a fair question.\" He nodded, uncomfortable under her scrutiny. \"No, it isn\u0027t,\" she said. \"And it was wrong to ask you. So I\u0027m sorry.\" \"It\u0027s okay,\" he said. She ate another spoonful, hesitating before going on. \"Do you remember when I told you that I didn\u0027t want to hire you because you were in the marines?\" He nodded. \"It\u0027s not what you probably think. It wasn\u0027t because you reminded me of Drake. It\u0027s because of the way Drake died.\" She tapped her spoon against the bowl. \"Drake was killed by friendly fire.\" Thibault turned away as she went on. \"Of course, I didn\u0027t know that at first. We kept getting the runaround. \u0027The investigation is continuing\u0027 or \u0027We\u0027re looking into the matter,* things like that. It took months to find out how he was killed, and even then, we never really learned who was responsible.\" She groped for the right words. \"It just… didn\u0027t seem right, you know? I mean, I know it was an accident, I know whoever did it didn\u0027t mean to kill him, but if something like that happened here in the States, someone would be charged with manslaughter. But if it happens in Iraq, no one wants the truth to come out. And it never will.\" \"Why are you telling me this?\" Thibault said, his voice quiet. \"Because,\" she said, \"that\u0027s the real reason I didn\u0027t want to hire you. After I found out what happened, it seemed like every time I saw a marine, I\u0027d be asking myself, Was he the one who killed Drake? Or is he covering up for someone who killed him? I knew it wasn\u0027t fair, I knew it was wrong, but I couldn\u0027t help it. And after a while, the anger I felt just sort of became part of me, like it was the only way I knew how to handle the grief. I didn\u0027t like who I\u0027d become, but I was stuck in this horrible cycle of questions and blame. And then, out of the blue, you walked into the office and applied for a job. And Nana, even though she knew exactly how I was feeling—maybe because of the way I was feeling—decided to hire you.\" She set her bowl aside. \"That\u0027s why I didn\u0027t have much to say to you the first couple of weeks. I didn\u0027t know what I could say. I figured I wouldn\u0027t have to say anything, since more than likely you\u0027d quit within a few days like everyone else. But you didn\u0027t. Instead, you work hard and stay late, you\u0027re wonderful to Nana and my son … and all of a sudden, you\u0027re not so much a marine as you are just a man.\" She paused as if lost in thought, then finally nudged him with her knee. \"And not only that, you\u0027re a man who allows emotional women to ramble on without telling them to stop.\" He nudged her back to show her it was okay. \"It\u0027s Drake\u0027s birthday.\" \"Yes, it is.\" She raised her bowl. \"To my little brother, Drake,\" she said. Thibault tapped his bowl against hers. \"To Drake,\" he echoed. Zeus whined and stared up at them anxiously. Despite the tension, she reached out and ruffled his fur. \"You don\u0027t need a toast. This is Drake\u0027s moment.\" He tilted his head in puzzlement, and she laughed. \"Blah, blah, blah. He doesn\u0027t understand a word I\u0027m saying.\" \"True, but he can tell you were upset. That\u0027s why he stayed close.\" \"He\u0027s really amazing. I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever seen a dog so intuitive and well trained. Nana said the same thing, and believe me, that\u0027s saying a lot.\" \"Thanks,\" he said. \"Good bloodlines.\" \"Okay,\" she said. \"Your turn to talk. You pretty much know everything there is to know about me.\" \"What do you want to know?\" She picked up her bowl and spooned more ice cream into her mouth before asking, \"Have you ever been in love?\" When he raised his eyebrows at the nonchalant way she\u0027d said it, she waved him off. \"Don\u0027t even think I\u0027m being too personal. Not after everything I\u0027ve told you. \u0027Fess up.\" \"Once,\" he admitted. \"Recently?\" \"No. Years ago. When I was in college.\" \"What was she like?\" He seemed to search for the right word. \"Earthy,\" he offered. She said nothing, but her expression told him she wanted more. \"Okay,\" he continued. \"She was a women\u0027s studies major, and she favored Birkenstocks and peasant skirts. She despised makeup. She wrote opinions for the student newspaper and championed the causes of pretty much every sociological group in the world except white males and the rich. Oh, and she was a vegetarian, too.\" She studied him. \"For some reason, I can\u0027t see you with someone like that.\" \"Neither could I. And neither could she. Not in the long run, anyway. But for a while, it was surprisingly easy to overlook out obvious differences. And we did.\" \"How long did it last?\" \"A little more than a year.\" \"Do you ever hear from her anymore?\" He shook his head. \"Never.\" \"And that\u0027s it?\" \"Aside from a couple of high school crushes, that\u0027s it. But bear in mind that the last five years haven\u0027t exactly been conducive to starting new relationships.\" \"No, I don\u0027t suppose so.\" Zeus got up and stared down the drive, his ears twitching. Alert. It took a moment, but Thibault heard the faint sound of a car engine, and in the distance, a broad, dispersed light flashed in the trees before it began to narrow. Someone pulling up the drive. Elizabeth frowned in confusion before a sedan slowly rounded the corner and came toward the house. Even though the lights from the porch didn\u0027t illuminate the drive, Thibault recognized the car and sat up straighter. It was either the sheriff or one of his deputies. Elizabeth recognized it as well. \"This can\u0027t be good,\" she muttered. \"What do you think they want?\" She stood from her spot on the porch. \"It\u0027s not a they. It\u0027s a him. My ex-husband.\" She started down the steps and motioned toward him. \"Just wait here. I\u0027ll handle this.\" Thibault motioned for Zeus to sit and stay as the car pulled to a stop beside Elizabeth\u0027s car at the far end of the house. Through the bushes, he saw the passenger door open and watched as Ben got out, dragging his backpack behind him. He started toward his mother, keeping his head down. When the driver\u0027s-side door opened, Deputy Keith Clayton stepped out. Zeus let out a low growl, alert and ready, waiting for Thibault\u0027s command to go after the guy. Elizabeth glanced at Zeus in surprise until Ben stepped into the light. Thibault noticed the absence of Ben\u0027s glasses and the black-and’ blue bruises around Ben\u0027s eye at the same moment Elizabeth did. \"What happened!\" she cried, hurrying toward her son. She squatted to get a better look. \"What did you do?\" \"It\u0027s nothing,\" Clayton responded, approaching them. \"It\u0027s just a bruise.\" Ben turned away, not wanting her to see. \"What about his glasses?\" Elizabeth said, still trying to make sense of it. \"Did you hit him?\" \"No, I didn\u0027t hit him. Christ! I wouldn\u0027t hit him. Who do you think I am?\" Elizabeth didn\u0027t seem to hear him and focused her attention on her son. \"Are you all right? Oh, that looks bad! What happened, sweetie? Are your glasses broken?\" She knew he wouldn\u0027t say anything until after Clayton left. Tilting his face up to hers, she could see the vessels had burst in his eye, leaving it bloody. \"How hard did you throw it?\" she demanded, her expression horrified. \"Not too hard. And it\u0027s just a bruise. His eye is fine, and we managed to tape his glasses back together.\" \"It\u0027s more than a bruise!\" Elizabeth\u0027s voice rose, barely controlled. \"Stop acting like this is my fault!\" Clayton barked. \"It is your fault!\" \"He\u0027s the one who missed it! We were just playing catch. It was an accident, for God\u0027s sake! Wasn\u0027t it, Ben? We were having fun, right?\" Ben stared at the ground. \"Yeah,\" he mumbled. \"Tell her what happened. Tell her it wasn\u0027t my fault. Go ahead.\" Ben shifted from one foot to the other. \"We were playing catch. I missed the ball and it hit me in the eye.\" He held up his glasses, crudely taped at the bridge and the top of one lens with duct tape. \"Dad fixed my glasses.\" Clayton held up his palms. \"See? No big deal. Happens all the time. It\u0027s part of the game.\" \"When did this happen?\" Elizabeth demanded. \"A few hours ago.\" \"And you didn\u0027t call me?\" \"No. I took him to the emergency room.\" \"The emergency room?\" \"Where else was I supposed to take him? I knew I couldn\u0027t bring him back here without having him checked out, so I did. I did what any responsible parent would do, just like you did when he fell off the swing and broke his arm. And if you remember, I didn\u0027t get all crazy on you, just like I don\u0027t get crazy about you letting him play in the tree house. The thing is a death trap.\" She seemed too shocked to speak, and he shook his head in disgust. \"Anyway, he wanted to go home.\" \"Okay,\" she said, still struggling with her words. A muscle clenched and unclenched in her jaw. She waved Clayton off. \"Whatever. Just go. I\u0027ll take it from here.\" With her arm around Ben, she started to lead him away, and it was in that instant that Clayton spotted Thibault sitting on the porch, staring directly at him. Clayton\u0027s eyes widened before they flashed in anger. He started for the porch. \"What are you doing here?\" he demanded. Thibault simply stared at him without moving. Zeus\u0027s growls grew more ominous. \"What\u0027s he doing here, Beth?\" \"Just go, Keith. We\u0027ll talk about this tomorrow.\" She turned away. \"Don\u0027t walk away from me,\" he spat, reaching for her arm. \"I\u0027m just asking you a question.\" At that moment, Zeus snarled and his rear legs began to quiver. For the first time, Clayton seemed to notice the dog, his teeth bared, the fur on his back standing straight up. \"If I were you, I\u0027d let go of her arm,\" Thibault said. His voice was flat and calm, more a suggestion than an order. \"Right now.\" Clayton, eyeing the dog, let go immediately. As Elizabeth and Ben hurried to the porch, Clayton glared at Thibault. Zeus took a single step forward, continuing to snarl. \"I think you\u0027d better go,\" Thibault said, his voice quiet. Clayton debated for an instant, then took a step backward and turned away. Thibault heard him cursing under his breath as he stalked back to the car, opened the door, and slammed it shut behind him. Thibault reached out to pet Zeus. \"Good boy,\" he whispered. Clayton backed out of his spot, made a sloppy three-point turn, and took off up the drive, spewing gravel. His taillights receded from view, and only then did the fur on Zeus\u0027s back finally lower. His tail wagged as Ben approached. \"Hi, Zeus,\" Ben said. Zeus glanced at Thibault for permission. \"It\u0027s okay,\" Thibault said, releasing him. Zeus pranced toward Ben as if to say, I\u0027m so happy you\u0027re home! He nosed at Ben, who started to pet him. -You missed me, huh?\" Ben said, sounding pleased. \"I missed “Here, sweetie,\" Elizabeth urged, moving him forward again. \"Let\u0027s go inside and put some ice on your eye. And I Want to see it in the light\" \u0027 As they opened the screen door, Thibault stood. \"Hey, Thibault,\" Ben said, waving. \"Hi, Ben.\" \"Can I play with Zeus tomorrow?\" Tf it\u0027s okay with your mom, it\u0027s okay with me.\" Thibault could tell by looking at Elizabeth that she wanted to be alone with her son. \"I should probably go,\" he said, rising from his spot. \"It\u0027s getting late, and I\u0027ve got an early morning.\" \"Thanks,\" she said. \"I appreciate it. And sorry for all this.\" \"There\u0027s nothing to be sorry for.\" He walked a ways down the drive, then turned toward the house. He could just make out movement behind the curtains of the living room window. Staring at the shadows of the two figures in the window, he felt for the first time that he was finally beginning to understand the reason he\u0027d come. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2101/59637.html","bookId":521,"book":{"id":521,"title":"The Lucky One 幸运符","description":"简介： 《幸运符》是《纽约时报》畅销书排行榜榜首作家爱情小说圣手尼古拉斯斯帕克思最斯帕克思味的真爱之篇，一个男人与死亡擦身而过，命运的力量却引领他找到一生的挚爱。在战火纷飞的伊拉克，前美国海军陆战队队员蒂伯在废墟里捡到一张照片，照片上一个年轻女人微笑着。自此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201804/25/10-42-16-95-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2101","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
