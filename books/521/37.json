{"id":27846,"no":37,"title":"Chapter 37 Clayton","content":"Beth tried to force her way past Clayton, but he reached for her arm again. \"We\u0027re not done yet,\" he growled. He wasn\u0027t going to let her leave without making sure she understood. \"He ran outside!\" \"He\u0027ll be fine. I want to make sure you\u0027re clear on how things are going to go with us.\" Beth didn\u0027t hesitate, slapping him across the face with her free hand, and he recoiled. When he let go, she pushed him backward with all her might, sensing that he was still off balance. \"Get the hell out!\" she screamed. As soon as he steadied his feet, she slammed him in the chest again. \"I am so sick of you and your family telling me what I can and can\u0027t do, and I\u0027m not going to put up with it anymore!\" \"Too bad,\" he shot back, the words coming naturally. \"You don\u0027t have a choice. I\u0027m not going to let Ben anywhere near that friend of yours.\" Instead of answering, as if tired of listening to him, she pushed away and strode past him. Where are you going?\" he demanded. \"We\u0027re not finished.\" Pounded through the living room. \"I\u0027m going to find Ben.\" \"It\u0027s just rain!\" \"It\u0027s flooding, in case you haven\u0027t noticed.\" He watched her run out onto the porch, expecting her to find Ben there, but for some reason, she looked both ways and vanished from view. Lightning flashed, thunder echoing a moment later. Close. Too close. Clayton moved to the door and noticed that.she\u0027d headed to the far edge and was scanning the yard. Just then, he saw Nana approaching with an umbrella. \"Have you seen Ben?\" Beth suddenly called out. \"No,\" Nana answered, looking confused, rain pouring around her. \"I just got here. What\u0027s going on?\" She stopped short at the sight of Clayton. \"What\u0027s he doing here?\" she demanded. \"He didn\u0027t go past you?\" Beth asked, suddenly jogging toward the steps. \"It\u0027s no big deal,\" Clayton said, knowing he had to finish things with Beth. \"He\u0027ll be back…\" Beth stopped suddenly and faced him. All at once, Clayton noticed her anger had been replaced by something close to terror. The noise of the storm seemed to be suddenly very far away. \"What is it?\" he asked. \"The tree house …\" It took only a moment to process the words, and then Clayton felt his chest constrict. A moment later, they were both charging for the woods. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2101/59661.html","bookId":521,"book":{"id":521,"title":"The Lucky One 幸运符","description":"简介： 《幸运符》是《纽约时报》畅销书排行榜榜首作家爱情小说圣手尼古拉斯斯帕克思最斯帕克思味的真爱之篇，一个男人与死亡擦身而过，命运的力量却引领他找到一生的挚爱。在战火纷飞的伊拉克，前美国海军陆战队队员蒂伯在废墟里捡到一张照片，照片上一个年轻女人微笑着。自此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201804/25/10-42-16-95-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2101","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
