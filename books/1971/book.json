{"id":1971,"title":"The Temptation of Lila and Ethan (The Secret #3)","description":"Storyline: The Temptation of Lila and Ethan (The Secret #3) On the surface, Lila Summers is flawless: good looks, expensive clothes, and a big, beautiful smile. But a dark past and even darker secrets are threatening to bubble over her perfect fa√ßade. She\u0027ll do anything to keep the emptiness inside hidden-which leads her into situations that always end badly. Whenever she hits bottom, there\u0027s only one person who\u0027s there to pull her out: Ethan Gregory. Ethan set the rules a long time ago: he and Lila are just friends. He doesn\u0027t do relationships. Although his tattooed, bad boy exterior is a far cry from Lila\u0027s pretty princess image, Ethan can\u0027t deny they have a deeper connection than he\u0027s used to. If he\u0027s not careful, he could be in serious danger of becoming attached-and he\u0027s learned the hard way that attachment only leads to heartbreak. When Lila falls farther than she ever has before, can Ethan continue to help as a friend? Or is he also getting close to falling . . . for her?","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-temptation-of-lila-and-ethan-the-secret-3.jpg","author":"Jessica Sorensen","type":"Young Adult","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":53,"category":{"id":9,"name":"Young Adult","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
