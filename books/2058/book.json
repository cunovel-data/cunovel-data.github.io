{"id":2058,"title":"Succubus Shadows (Georgina Kincaid #5)","description":"Storyline: Georgina Kincaid Book 5: Succubus Shadows Something ominous is tracking reluctant succubus Georgina Kincaid through her effervescent fifth urban fantasy adventure (after 2009\u0027s Succubus Heat). An elusive entity that Georgina can\u0027t name or fight invades her thoughts and nearly persuades her to kill herself. Georgina\u0027s boss, archdemon Jerome, and her angel friend Carter can\u0027t even detect the phenomenon, much less figure out how to stop it. Georgina\u0027s ex-boyfriend, Seth, is about to marry her friend Maddie, and what with pining after Seth, trying to protect him from another succubus, and being one of Maddie\u0027s bridesmaids, Georgia finds that suicide is starting to sound very tempting. Mead\u0027s lighthearted romp is plenty of fun on the surface; Georgina\u0027s struggles with the gray areas between good and evil provide a powerful undercurrent.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/succubus-shadows-georgina-kincaid-5.jpg","author":"Richelle Mead","type":"Fantasy","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":25,"category":{"id":18,"name":"Fantasy","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
