{"id":110416,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"\"You\u0027re right,\" said Roman the next morning, ruminating over what had happened with Gavin. \"I didn\u0027t like that.\" I was standing in the bathroom, going over my hair with a flat iron. It was a pain in the ass compared to shape-shifting, but I liked the challenge. Plus, I could always fine-tune the frizziness away afterward. \"Not like it\u0027s the first time it\u0027s happened,\" I pointed out, my eyes on the mirror rather than where he leaned in the doorway. \"You used to never mind.\" \"Didn\u0027t I?\" he asked dryly. \"Well, being with him distracted me from wallowing in self-pity. Not that it made me feel that great either,\" I admitted. \"But it kept my...whatever...away. And hey, it couldn\u0027t have been as nasty as what you saw Simone do.\" \"True, but now that guy\u0027s just going to come trolling around all the time. He\u0027ll be showing up to borrow cups of sugar in the hopes he can score some more action.\" \"I\u0027ll deal with him. I\u0027ve got a little practice in pushing guys away.\" \"Don\u0027t I know it.\" I paused to shoot him a glare. \"Will you lay off the attitude this morning? You\u0027re starting to sound like you\u0027re jealous or something.\" Roman snorted. \"Hardly. Why in God\u0027s name would I be jealous over the woman who got my sister killed and tried to unleash the forces of Heaven and Hell to destroy me?\" Fair point. \"It\u0027s a little more complicated than that.\" \"Oh, yes, I\u0027m sure.\" He crossed his arms and stared down at the floor. \"But maybe the next time you\u0027re looking for distraction, we could rent a movie and microwave some popcorn instead of fucking the neighbors.\" \"You have horrible taste in movies,\" I mumbled. But that closed the conversation, and Roman wandered off. A few moments later, I heard the TV turn on. I had to work today, but it was an afternoon shift. I was up and ready to go early because I wanted to visit Erik. I should have felt secure in Jerome\u0027s ability to figure out what was going on, as well as Roman\u0027s protection. But I\u0027d had too much shit happen to me in the past to ever fully trust anyone. Erik had always proven a valuable resource. Roman went with me, covertly, but it took a while for me to actually get some quality time with Erik. He had customers in the store - which was great for him, but I could hardly discuss immortal affairs with others around. When the people finally thinned out, Erik turned his attention to me, ready with his typical friendly smile. His color looked better, and his movements weren\u0027t as jerky. He was still weak, just not as weak. \"Your cold\u0027s cleared up,\" I said. His smile grew. \"Yes, I told you it was nothing. A mere cold isn\u0027t going to kill me off.\" His voice was light, but I couldn\u0027t help a small frown. There had been something in his words - something I couldn\u0027t quite put my finger on - that made it sound like he did know what was going to kill him. A chill ran down my spine. I didn\u0027t like to think of those sorts of things. I sat down at his little table with him but declined tea. \"I just wanted to see if you\u0027d learned anything else.\" It was a nervous impulse on my part. I knew he would have contacted me if he had discovered something. \"No, but as I said, the information we have is vague enough for it to be any number of things.\" \"That\u0027s what Jerome said.\" Erik looked pleased. \"I\u0027m glad he knows. I\u0027ve always said that your own people are more likely to know better than me.\" I couldn\u0027t help a small laugh. \"Debatable. I might have something to make it a little less vague.\" Briefly, I explained my recent encounter and how it had occurred to me that this force only visited when I was troubled and depressed. \"It\u0027s like...it\u0027s like it\u0027s preying on my weakness. Trying to lure me in with promises of comfort.\" \"Then you must be careful not to give in.\" If Roman had said that, I would have snapped at him for stating the obvious. \"It\u0027s easy to say that now, in the cold light of logic, but when it happens...I don\u0027t know. I lose my grip on the world. Reason\u0027s gone. Hell, half the time I don\u0027t even know what\u0027s happening until afterward. It\u0027s like...sleeping. Sleepwalking. Whatever.\" \"And it always appears as a type of doorway?\" I pondered this for several seconds. \"I don\u0027t know...kind of. I don\u0027t know how to describe it - and I know I keep saying that. And how useless it sounds. I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s a door, exactly, but it\u0027s definitely trying to pull me into something.\" Erik had made himself tea and sat for almost a minute sipping it, his brow knit in thought. \"I\u0027ll think about all of this. In the meantime, I\u0027d just advise...\" He hesitated. \"Well, let me put it this way. You are a delight, Miss Kincaid, and I always enjoy my time with you. However, you are also - how can I say this - someone frequently given to darker moods.\" \"Is that your polite way of saying I\u0027m always down?\" I teased. \"No...not exactly. But if this thing is seeking out those in emotionally depressed states, then I\u0027d say you are particularly susceptible. If it\u0027s at all possible, you should try to stay away from those moods.\" I thought about it. One of my best friends was marrying my ex - an ex whom I was starting to fall for all over again. An ex whose soul I had inadvertently damned to Hell and who was now being stalked by another succubus. My own soul had long since been Hell-bound, and I was committed to an eternity of sleeping with men whom I often didn\u0027t like. Oh, yeah. Let\u0027s not forget that my roommate was given to sociopathic tendencies and had me on his hit list. \"That might be easier said than done,\" I told Erik. \"I can imagine,\" he said ruefully. \"But it may be the only way to protect yourself. That and your own willpower - the strength of which I firmly believe in.\" Erik\u0027s faith in me warmed up a piece of my heart, even though the rest of today\u0027s insight hadn\u0027t been all that insightful. I thanked him for his time and headed off to work, grateful Roman offered no \"witty\" commentary during our drive. At the bookstore, Seth worked alone in the caf¨¦. Simone was nowhere in sight, which was one bonus. The fact that it was Maddie\u0027s day off also improved my mood. Maybe staying away from my usual glum state wouldn\u0027t be as hard as I thought. \"Yo, Kincaid.\" Doug found me putting stickers on our rack of clearance books. They mostly consisted of out-of-print coffee-table books, things like Stone Arches of Tuscany and The Complete Book of Bridal Cross-stitch. I wasn\u0027t entirely sure what that last one was, but maybe it\u0027d make a good wedding present for Seth and Maddie. The price was certainly a bargain. We\u0027d reduced it three times now, and still no one wanted to buy it. \"What\u0027s up?\" I asked. \"I\u0027ve got news that\u0027s going to rock your world. And make you think I\u0027m even awesomer than you already do.\" \"That\u0027s a bold statement.\" He paused, apparently trying to decide if he\u0027d been complimented or insulted. \"I just found out that Gabrielle\u0027s a fan of Blue Satin Bra.\" \"She never struck me as that type. I figured all of her lingerie would be black.\" Doug gave me a withering look. \"No, Kincaid. I don\u0027t mean that she wears one. I mean that she likes the group. Haven\u0027t you heard of them?\" \"There\u0027s a group called Blue Satin Bra?\" I shook my head. \"Sorry. I can\u0027t keep up with every new garage band in Seattle.\" \"They aren\u0027t a garage band! They\u0027re the hottest thing to hit the metal scene. They\u0027re going to make it big.\" I tried to hide my skepticism. Doug himself was in a band called Nocturnal Admission, and whenever he spoke about local bands, it seemed like everyone was on the verge of making it big. \"What\u0027s this got to do with Gabrielle again?\" Doug was clearly growing frustrated with me. \"She\u0027s a huge fan - and they\u0027ve got a concert tomorrow night. Unfortunately, it\u0027s all sold out. She was pretty bummed about it.\" Despite his annoyance with me, I could sense the smugness within him. \"Here it comes....\" Pride lit his features. \"I\u0027m friends with the bass player and managed to score some tickets. If your pal Cody approaches her with them...\" I paused in my stickering. \"You\u0027re right. You did just get awesomer.\" \"You\u0027ve got to go too, you know.\" \"I - what?\" Me trailing along didn\u0027t sound romantic in the least. Doug shrugged. \"He can\u0027t just ask her out for an actual date. Not yet. He\u0027ll spook her.\" \"Then what exactly is he supposed to ask her out for?\" \"I do the asking. I\u0027ll just be all like, \u0027Hey, Gabby, I got some extra tickets to the show. You want to go along with me and my friends?\u0027 Then she\u0027s off guard. She comes along, Cody\u0027s there, magic happens....\" \"Wow,\" I said. \"Looks like you\u0027ve got it all figured out. And I don\u0027t think she likes to be called Gabby.\" \"This is a good plan.\" He was clearly very pleased with himself. \"I\u0027ve been around, Kincaid. When you get mad romantic skills like me, you\u0027ll understand.\" I rolled my eyes. \"We can only hope. So how many friends are going along exactly?\" \"I scored four tickets. So: you, me, Cody, and Gabrielle.\" \"Sounds suspiciously like a double date. You trying your mad romantic skills on me?\" It wouldn\u0027t be the first time. \"Hell no. Do I look suicidal? You\u0027re already claimed.\" For a minute, Seth came to mind, then Doug added: \"I\u0027m not getting on the bad side of that guy you\u0027re shacked up with. I mean, I can hold my own in a fight, but he looks like he could seriously fuck someone up.\" \"You have no idea,\" I muttered. No doubt Roman - lingering nearby invisibly - was loving this. \"But we aren\u0027t involved. He\u0027s just my roommate.\" \"For now,\" said Doug ominously. He began a retreat. \"I\u0027ll go invite Gabs. You tell Cody the deal and that you\u0027re going to be his wing-woman.\" I shook my head after Doug left, wondering what I\u0027d gotten myself into. His absurd comments about mad skills and wing-women aside, the whole casual group thing might be a gateway outing to get Gabrielle closer to Cody. I just hoped word of his Goth getup the other day hadn\u0027t gotten around to her. I also wondered what kind of experience I was getting myself into with Blue Satin Bra. Doug\u0027s bizarre industrial alternative music had grown on me over the years, but I had a feeling this concert would be a very different experience. About an hour later, I was in my office when some unexpected guests popped their heads in. Well, one wasn\u0027t entirely unexpected. I\u0027d found that even when Maddie wasn\u0027t working, there was never any real security. You couldn\u0027t count on her absence, not when her boyfriend and brother were often in the store. I could feel some safety when we didn\u0027t have the same shift, but I\u0027d long accepted that Maddie could really show up at any moment. No, the real surprise was that Maddie was in my office with Brandy Mortensen, Seth\u0027s niece. He had five of them, and she was the oldest. When Seth and I had dated, I\u0027d grown pretty attached to that brood. My longing for children and the girls\u0027 total adorableness made it easy for me to love them. They\u0027d grown close to me too. Of course, at fourteen, I suspected Brandy wouldn\u0027t appreciate being called \"adorable.\" She stood with Maddie, who was holding a garment bag on a hanger. Brandy wore a surprisingly sullen teen expression. She seemed taller to me than when I\u0027d last seen her. Just like with Erik, time was passing quickly for these humans. \"Hey, guys,\" I said, setting my paperwork aside. \"What\u0027s up?\" \"More wedding errands,\" said Maddie cheerfully. \"We just came by to pick up Seth. We went back to that shop and got a dress for Brandy. She\u0027s a bridesmaid too.\" Maddie lifted the edge of the bag, revealing the same dress Maddie had bought me the other day. \"How embarrassing,\" I told Brandy. \"We\u0027re going to show up in the same outfit.\" She gave me the ghost of a smile but stayed silent. \"We also went and talked to some florists but didn\u0027t really come up with any ideas on what to get. If I get something purple, will it be too monochromatic? And if I get a different color, will it look weird?\" \"Hard questions,\" I said solemnly. Ones I didn\u0027t want to answer. \"Maybe you can come back with me and take a look at some of their books?\" Maddie was giving me that hopeful, cheery smile that was so good at inspiring guilt in me. \"I don\u0027t know,\" I said vaguely. \"Depends on my schedule.\" \"Well, let me know. Let me go grab Seth - maybe he has some ideas.\" Good luck with that, I thought. Seth was notoriously awful at offering opinions, and he\u0027d seemed particularly non-committal about this wedding stuff, no pun intended. Maddie left Brandy with me, and I gave her a genuine smile. \"So how\u0027s it been going?\" I asked. \"Did you have fun shopping?\" Brandy crossed her arms over her chest and tossed her blond hair over one shoulder. She was wearing a formfitting Rocky Horror Picture Show T-shirt. Really, I thought. She was one step away from turning into her uncle. \"No,\" she said bluntly. I arched an eyebrow in surprise. Last I\u0027d known, shopping and having people buy you clothes was pretty sweet when you were a teenage girl. Maybe I was out of touch. \"Why not?\" \"Because,\" she said dramatically. \"This wedding is a joke.\" I cast an uneasy glance at the doorway. \"Better not let them hear you say that.\" Brandy looked unconcerned. She wasn\u0027t exactly scowling, but it was pretty close. \"Uncle Seth isn\u0027t supposed to be marrying her.\" \"Why not? They\u0027ve been dating for...well, a while.\" That was kind of true, guilt-induced engagement or no. \"He proposed. She accepted. Easy as that.\" \"She\u0027s not the one,\" said Brandy stoutly. \"He\u0027s supposed to be marrying you.\" Yeah, I really wished the door was closed. \"Brandy,\" I said, pitching my voice as low as I could. \"Your uncle and I broke up. That\u0027s how it is. People move on.\" \"You two weren\u0027t supposed to. You guys were in love.\" \"He loves her too.\" \"It\u0027s not the same.\" This was not a discussion I\u0027d ever expected to have. I\u0027d known Seth\u0027s nieces still liked me, but I\u0027d hardly thought I\u0027d left this sort of impression. \"Do you not like Maddie or something?\" Brandy gave a half-hearted shrug and averted her eyes. \"She\u0027s okay. But she\u0027s not you.\" I didn\u0027t say anything for several moments. I wondered if Brandy\u0027s resentment toward the wedding was because she had greater devotion to me than Maddie - or if it was part of some romantic ideal girls her age often had about love and soul mates. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" I said. \"Love in the real world doesn\u0027t usually work out the way stories make us think it should. We don\u0027t always get fairy-tale endings. People split up and move on. Just because you love someone doesn\u0027t mean you can\u0027t love someone else.\" I shivered. This was remarkably similar to a conversation Carter and I had once had, shortly after the (first) break-up with Seth. \"It\u0027s still not right,\" said Brandy obstinately. Seth and Maddie retrieved her shortly thereafter, for which I was grateful. I really didn\u0027t want to have to play devil\u0027s advocate and defend a marriage that I was hardly thrilled about myself. I felt that sorrow that always seemed to plague me when I thought about them surface...and then remembered Erik\u0027s comments. Don\u0027t give in to it. Stay away from it - that was what kept leading me into trouble. Easier said than done, just as I\u0027d told him. Distraction seemed to be the key to it all, and I just didn\u0027t feel up to another liaison tonight. I certainly didn\u0027t need the energy. \"Distract me,\" I murmured when I was seated in my car. \"Annoy me with your \u0027wit,\u0027 or just make me outright mad.\" No physical evidence of Roman appeared - no signature, no physical appearance - but his voice answered me back just as softly. \"Go see your friends. Aren\u0027t they going to that bar tonight? You need to tell Cody he\u0027s going on a double date.\" \"It\u0027s not a double date,\" I growled back. But Roman had a point. I probably should let the young vampire know what was in store tomorrow. I was also kind of curious how Roman even knew about the bar outing. I\u0027d received a voice mail message earlier today that one would think would have been out of Roman\u0027s hearing range. He\u0027d either been standing really close, or nephilim just had superhuman hearing. And, well, seeing as they were superhuman, I supposed that wasn\u0027t too far off. Another idea suddenly came to mind about tonight\u0027s social gathering, one that would most definitely provide a distraction - and possibly take care of a nuisance. \"The bar it is,\" I declared. I drove down to Pioneer Square, Seattle\u0027s historic district, and sought out the Cellar, a dive of a bar located in a basement akin to its name. It was a favorite place for immortals - well, hellish immortals. Since most angels didn\u0027t drink - Carter being the exception - you didn\u0027t usually find them hanging out in bars. They were more likely to be found at upscale coffee shops. For inexplicable reasons, a number of them also liked to hang out at the restaurant on top of the Space Needle. Maybe they thought it was bringing them closer to Heaven. And, indeed, as I walked down the stairs into the Cellar, I felt Carter\u0027s signature, along with those of my usual clique. Best of all, there was an additional signature I\u0027d been hoping to find. \"Hot damn,\" I said, striding toward the table where Simone sat with my friends. She burned with the glow of energy that succubi stole from their victims. I hated to admit it, but hers was brighter than the one I still sported. I assured myself that it was just because she\u0027d probably bagged someone today, rather than last night. Hugh scooted to make room for me, and I pulled up a chair from a neighboring table. \"Didn\u0027t think you\u0027d show tonight.\" I waved a waiter over and ordered a vodka gimlet. \"You know I can\u0027t stay away from you guys.\" \"You\u0027re just in time,\" said Carter. His face was neutral, but I caught a mischievous glint in his eyes as he sipped his bourbon. \"Simone was just regaling us with tales of the Underground Tour. Did you hear that Seattle burned to the ground and was rebuilt a century ago?\" \"Only every time I take the tour,\" I replied. Which had been about a dozen times. It was a tourist hotbed, and I\u0027d taken friends and out-of-town victims on it often. I gave Simone a curious look. \"Did you do that today?\" She nodded. \"Figured I should take in the city while I\u0027m here.\" She was still using that librarian voice, but I had to admit she looked more like a succubus than the last time I\u0027d seen her. Her neckline was cut so low, it was a wonder her nipples didn\u0027t show. Her lips were fuck-me red, and unless I was mistaken, her hair was longer and more voluminous than before. I couldn\u0027t decide if she looked like an angel or a beach bunny. And speaking of angels...Simone had her chair pushed right next to Carter\u0027s, so close that she couldn\u0027t help but brush her arm against his each time she reached for her drink. I suspected her leg was pressed up to his as well. He glanced over, giving her a look that wasn\u0027t exactly romantic but filled with deep interest I felt certain was feigned. \"I find Seattle\u0027s history fascinating. I haven\u0027t been here that long, so it\u0027s great to keep learning new things.\" Simone beamed. Across the table, Hugh choked a little on his drink. Carter had been in Seattle for a couple hundred years. True - not that long for an immortal like him, but he\u0027d most certainly been here for the Seattle fire. Hell, considering how he\u0027d once accidentally burned down my Christmas tree, he might have been the one who set the city ablaze, for all I knew. My gimlet appeared, and I took a long drink of liquid courage. \"From what I hear, you\u0027ve been checking out some of our local celebrities too,\" I said sweetly. Simone dragged her adoring gaze from Carter and fixed me with a frown. \"I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve run into many celebrities.\" \"Well,\" I said, still smiling like a fool. \"I guess it depends on how you define \u0027celebrity.\u0027 I certainly consider best-selling authors celebrities. You\u0027ve been chatting up one quite a bit.\" Immediately, Cody, Hugh, and Peter eagerly snapped to attention. They could sniff female conflict a mile away and were undoubtedly bracing themselves for a cat fight. \"Oh, that,\" she said dismissively. \"I thought you meant like an actor or something. Yeah, he\u0027s just someone on my radar. One of many. Pretty cute. Nice enough.\" \"And a friend of mine,\" I said. My voice was still cheerful, but I could see in her eyes that she was well aware of the escalating tension. \"Still, fair game,\" she replied with a shrug. \"And what do you care? His soul\u0027s already tainted. He\u0027s not that good a catch. Not like I can do much more damage.\" That wasn\u0027t true. Seth might currently be Hell-bound, but he wasn\u0027t beyond redemption - even though the odds of that were allegedly slim. If by some crazy chance Simone got him to cheat on Maddie again, his soul would grow darker and kill any lingering chances to save him. Plus, sin aside, Simone would shorten his life - which was something I was definitely against. \"So, he\u0027s just a random guy you scoped out?\" I asked. The politeness was fading from me. It was disappearing from her too. So. Bland Simone wasn\u0027t quite as oblivious as she played. \"The fact that he\u0027s a friend of mine and someone I used to date makes no difference?\" \"You make it sound like I\u0027m trying to get you back for something. I don\u0027t even know you. I\u0027m just here on vacation. Getting guys is part of our life - and you don\u0027t have any territorial control like them.\" She nodded toward the vampires, who had very well-defined hunting grounds. \"Unless,\" she added smugly, \"you\u0027ve got some kind of arrangement with Jerome.\" I certainly didn\u0027t. In fact, my boss had made it extremely clear that he didn\u0027t care about what happened to Seth. \"No, but I\u0027d think you\u0027d do it as a courtesy when you\u0027re visiting someone else\u0027s city. It\u0027s the nice thing to do.\" My smile returned, filled with ice this time. \"And it ensures that your visit stays nice too.\" Maybe using her favorite adjective would drive home my message. Simone stiffened, attention totally on me now. \"What is this, some kind of warning that you\u0027ll come after me if I don\u0027t back off?\" I shrugged and finished my drink. \"Just friendly advice.\" She stood up and slung her purse over her shoulder with such force that it nearly hit Carter in the head. Apparently, he wasn\u0027t on the radar anymore. Well, at least for now. \"I\u0027m not going to stay and listen to thinly veiled threats. Especially ones over inconsequential men. If I want him, I\u0027ll get him.\" \"You\u0027ll be missed,\" I muttered as she stalked away. \"Oh,\" said Hugh brightly. \"There is nothing I like better than when succubi fight. Puts Dynasty to shame. You could have cleaned the floor with Tawny, but Simone might give you a match.\" \"Hardly,\" I said. \"And she\u0027ll have about as much luck with Seth as Carter.\" Carter raised an eyebrow, apparently not agreeing with my statement. \"She\u0027s really hitting on Seth?\" asked Cody. \"Yup. In a shy, starry-eyed fan girl kind of way.\" \"Isn\u0027t that how you won him over way back when?\" asked Peter. I shot him a glare. \"It\u0027s irrelevant. It won\u0027t work.\" \"Then why worry?\" asked Hugh slyly. \"Because an ounce of prevention - oh, never mind,\" I groaned. \"I need another drink.\" Hugh and the vampires were clearly amused by all this and weren\u0027t particularly concerned. I think they too believed Seth would prove immovable; they just liked the idea of me making another succubus irate. The sad part was that I\u0027d probably just encouraged Simone to try even harder. Two drinks later, I decided to head home. I was sufficiently angry that I didn\u0027t fear the siren song\u0027s comfort. Before leaving, I informed Cody about his impending date. Unsurprisingly, he freaked out. \"What? I...I can\u0027t. What will I say? What will I do?\" \"Frankly, my dear...\" began Hugh in an undertone. \"You\u0027ll be fine,\" I said. \"Just stop stressing and be yourself.\" \"Sounds like a double date,\" said Peter. \"I can get more black hair dye.\" \"No,\" I warned. \"Do not even think about it.\" I could still see faint streaks that hadn\u0027t entirely washed out from Cody\u0027s blond mane. \"Just dress like you are now. I\u0027ll meet you at the club.\" I started to turn, and then a thought came to me. \"Carter, can I talk to you?\" His lips twitched slightly. If that was his sign of surprise, I couldn\u0027t say. \"Anything for you, Daughter of Lilith.\" He followed me outside the bar, where we stood amid all the Pioneer Square partygoers. Once clear of the building\u0027s non-smoking interior, he promptly lit a cigarette. \"If you\u0027re jealous of my relationship with Simone,\" he said, \"I can assure you, we\u0027re just friends.\" \"Oh, be quiet. You know that\u0027s not what this is about. Look, she was lying, right? About Seth being a coincidence?\" Carter took a long drag before answering. Angels could tell when others were lying. \"Yep. But she seemed pretty sincere in the last comment about going after him regardless.\" I grimaced. \"Why? Why would she target Seth? Is it some kind of way to assert dominance over the local succubus?\" \"Not sure. The ways of succubi - and all women - are a mystery to me.\" \"Jerome originally thought she\u0027d come to spy. He had Roman follow her, but nothing came of it. She never reported in or anything. He pulled Roman from her - \" I paused, suddenly turning over the events and analyzing them in a way I hadn\u0027t considered before. \"But it wasn\u0027t until I told him Simone was hitting on Seth. It seemed like that was the moment Jerome pulled Roman. He seemed pretty adamant about leaving her alone.\" \"Did he now?\" Carter inhaled on the cigarette again, but I could see thoughts churning behind his eyes. \"What?\" I asked. \"Just a musing,\" he said. A half-truth, typical of angels. \"Did Jerome do anything else after that?\" \"Yeah, he put Roman on me.\" This elicited surprise. \"Why?\" Apparently, Jerome and Carter hadn\u0027t been hanging out recently. I gave Carter the rundown on my latest bizarre situation. \"That is weird,\" he admitted. \"Do you know what it could be?\" \"Any number of things.\" He spoke flippantly, but I knew I\u0027d piqued his curiosity - maybe even his concern. I sighed. \"I wish people would stop saying that. No one\u0027s really helping.\" \"I\u0027ll help you,\" he said, dropping the cigarette and stamping it out. \"I\u0027ll follow Simone.\" That was not at all what I had expected. \"Why would you do that? Are you going to stop her from making the moves on Seth?\" This earned his amusement. \"You know I can\u0027t interfere with that kind of thing. But I am curious about Simone\u0027s activities.\" An uneasy feeling bubbled within me, one that had troubled me since I\u0027d first met Seth, and Carter had begun taking an active role in my life. \"Why? Why do you care so much about Seth? You\u0027ve always been curious about what he does - and how we interact.\" \"I\u0027m interested in the creative process of a great artist. It\u0027s fun to watch.\" \"Another half-truth.\" Like always, he answered the question without really answering it. I was astonished at the desperation in my voice when I spoke next. \"I\u0027m serious. Why, Carter? How does Seth - and me being with Seth - concern you?\" He chucked me on the chin. \"You\u0027ve got better things to do than worry about the goings-on of a curious angel.

An elusive entity that Georgina can\u0027t name or fight invades her thoughts and nearly persuades her to kill herself. Georgina\u0027s boss, archdemon Jerome, and her angel friend Carter can\u0027t even detect the phenomenon, much less figure out how to stop it. Georgina\u0027s ex-boyfriend, Seth, is about to marry her friend Maddie, and what with pining after Seth, trying to protect him from another succubus, and being one of Maddie\u0027s bridesmaids, Georgia finds that suicide is starting to sound very tempting. Mead\u0027s lighthearted romp is plenty of fun on the surface; Georgina\u0027s struggles with the gray areas between good and evil provide a powerful undercurrent.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/succubus-shadows-georgina-kincaid-5.jpg","author":"Richelle Mead","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/succubus-shadows-georgina-kincaid-5.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:18 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:58:01 PM"}}
