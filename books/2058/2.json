Besides, I had never fully recovered from the time an ¨¹ber-powerful entity of chaos had merged with me in my sleep and sucked away my energy. Her name was Nyx, and last I\u0027d heard, she was imprisoned. Still, what she\u0027d done to me - and what she\u0027d shown me - had left a lasting impression. The fact that Roman couldn\u0027t identify what had happened tonight was a little unnerving.\\n\\n So, I woke up bleary-eyed, sporting a massive headache that was probably equal parts hangover and sleep deprivation. Succubi had the rapid healing that all immortals possessed, which meant I must have seriously screwed myself up to have these lingering effects. I knew the headache would pass soon, but I took some ibuprofen to help the process.\\n\\n The condo was quiet when I shuffled into the kitchen, and despite my efforts to clean up the food last night, I was still surrounded in the tattered and worn-out feel that followed most parties. Godiva, curled up on the back of the couch, lifted her head at my arrival, but Aubrey continued sleeping undisturbed in her spot on an armchair. I started some coffee and then wandered over to my patio, staring out at the sunny day and the Seattle skyline on the other side of the gray-blue water stretching off before me.\\n\\n A familiar sensation suddenly swept me, like brimstone and red-hot needles. I sighed.\\n\\n \"Kind of early for you, isn\u0027t it?\" I asked, not needing to turn around to know Jerome, archdemon of the greater Seattle area and my hellish boss, stood behind me.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s noon, Georgie,\" he replied dryly. \"The rest of the world is up and around.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s Saturday. The laws of time and space are different today. Noon qualifies as early.\"\\n\\n I turned around at last, largely because I\u0027d heard the coffee-maker finish. Jerome was leaning against my kitchen wall, immaculately dressed as always in a black designer suit. Also, like always, the demon looked exactly like a circa 1990s version of John Cusack. He could appear as anything or anyone he wanted in this world, but for reasons he kept vague, Mr. Cusack was his preferred shape. I\u0027d gotten so used to it that whenever Say Anything or Grosse Pointe Blank came on TV, I always had to pause and ask myself, \"What\u0027s Jerome doing in this movie?\"\\n\\n I poured a cup of coffee and held up the pot by way of invitation. Jerome shook his head. \"I suppose,\" he said, \"your roommate is also being a sloth and isn\u0027t actually out running errands?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027d be my guess.\" I doused my coffee liberally with vanilla creamer. \"I used to kind of hope that when he wasn\u0027t around, it meant he was out looking for a job. Turns out I was just setting myself up for disappointment.\"\\n\\n Honestly, I was glad it was Roman that Jerome had come to see. When Jerome was looking for me, no good ever came of it. It always tended to result in some traumatic, world-threatening event in the immortal underground.\\n\\n I trudged back across the living room, noting that the cats had disappeared upon Jerome\u0027s arrival. Coffee still in hand, I headed to Roman\u0027s room, knocking once before opening the door. I figured as landlady, I had that right. Also, I\u0027d found Roman had a remarkable ability to ignore knocking for large amounts of time.\\n\\n He was sprawled across his bed, wearing only a pair of navy blue boxers that gave me pause. As I\u0027d noted before, he was terribly good-looking, despite the prickly attitude he\u0027d had since moving in. Seeing him half-dressed always gave me a weird flashback to the one time we\u0027d slept together. Then, I\u0027d have to remind myself that he was probably plotting how to kill me. It went a long way to stifle any residual lust.\\n\\n Roman\u0027s arm covered his eyes against the sunlight streaming through his window. He shifted, moving the arm slightly, and peered at me with one eye. \"It\u0027s early,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Not according to your exalted sire.\"\\n\\n A few seconds passed, and then he grimaced as he too sensed Jerome\u0027s immortal signature. With a sigh, Roman sat up, pausing to rub his eyes. He looked about as exhausted as I felt, but if there was one force in this world that could drag him out of bed after a late night, it was my boss - no matter Roman\u0027s bold claims from last night. He staggered to his feet and moved past me in the doorway.\\n\\n \"Aren\u0027t you going to get dressed?\" I exclaimed.\\n\\n Roman\u0027s only answer was a disinterested wave of his hand as he headed down the hall. I followed him back and discovered Jerome pouring himself a mug of some vodka leftover from last night. Well, it was five o\u0027clock somewhere. He arched an eyebrow when he saw Roman\u0027s scantily clad state.\\n\\n \"Nice of you to dress up.\"\\n\\n Roman made a beeline for the coffee. \"Only the best for you, Pop. Besides, Georgina likes it.\"\\n\\n A moment of heavy silence followed as Jerome\u0027s dark eyes studied Roman. I knew nothing about Roman\u0027s mother, but Jerome was the demon who had fathered him thousands of years ago. Technically, Jerome had been an angel at the time, but making the moves on a human had got him fired from Heaven and sent off to work for those down below. No severance package.\\n\\n Roman occasionally made snide comments about their familial relationship, but Jerome never acknowledged it. In fact, according to both Heaven and Hell\u0027s rules, Jerome should have blasted Roman from the earth ages ago. Angels and demons considered nephilim unnatural and wrong and continually attempted to hunt them to extinction. It was kind of harsh, even with the sociopathic tendencies nephilim tended to have. Roman had been instrumental in saving Jerome recently, however, and the two had struck a deal that allowed Roman to live peacefully in Seattle - for now. If any of Jerome\u0027s colleagues found out about this illicit arrangement, there would literally be hell to pay - for all of us. A good succubus would have told on her rule-breaking boss.\\n\\n \"So what brings you here?\" asked Roman, pulling up a chair. \"Want to toss the old football around?\"\\n\\n Jerome\u0027s face remained impassive. \"I have a job for you.\"\\n\\n \"Like one that pays the rent?\" I asked hopefully.\\n\\n \"Like one that ensures I\u0027ll continue to allow him to live in the lifestyle he\u0027s accustomed to,\" replied Jerome.\\n\\n Roman had an amused, devil-may-care smile on his face that was typical of him, but I wasn\u0027t fooled. He knew the threat Jerome represented and also knew that part of their deal involved Roman doing errands for his father. Still, Roman made a good show of acting like he was the one doing Jerome a favor. The nephilim gave an unconcerned shrug.\\n\\n \"Sure. I\u0027ve got nothing else going on today. What\u0027s up?\"\\n\\n \"We have a new immortal visitor in town,\" said Jerome. If Roman\u0027s attitude annoyed him, the demon was just as good at masking his feelings. \"A succubus.\"\\n\\n My removed, psychological study of father and son dynamics came to a screeching halt. \"What?\" I exclaimed, straightening up so quickly that I nearly spilled my coffee. \"I thought we were set after Tawny.\"\\n\\n I\u0027d worked the succubus scene solo around here for years until Jerome had acquired another one several months ago. Her name was Tawny, and while she was annoying and pretty inept as succubi went, there was still something rather endearing about her. Fortunately, Jerome had sent her off to Bellingham, keeping her a comfortable hour-and-a-half drive from me.\\n\\n \"Not that it\u0027s any of your business, Georgie, but this one\u0027s not here to work. She\u0027s here...as a visitor. On vacation.\" Jerome\u0027s lips twisted with bitter amusement.\\n\\n Roman and I exchanged looks. Immortals could certainly take personal vacations, but clearly, there was more to this.\\n\\n \"And?\" asked Roman. \"She\u0027s really here because...?\"\\n\\n \"Because I\u0027m sure my superiors want to check up on me after the recent...incident.\"\\n\\n His words were delicate, with a very subtle warning not to elaborate on said incident. It was the one Roman and I had rescued him from - a summoning that had imprisoned Jerome as part of a demonic power play. Letting yourself get summoned was embarrassing for a demon and could call his territorial control into question. Hell sending someone to survey the situation wasn\u0027t that crazy.\\n\\n \"You think she\u0027s spying to see if you can still run things?\" asked Roman.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m certain of it. I want you to follow her around and see who she reports back to. I\u0027d do it myself, but it\u0027s better if I don\u0027t appear suspicious. So I need to stay visible.\"\\n\\n \"Lovely,\" said Roman, voice as dry as his father\u0027s. \"There\u0027s nothing I want to do more than trail a succubus around.\"\\n\\n \"From what I hear, you\u0027re pretty good at it,\" I piped in. It was true. Roman had stalked me invisibly a number of times. Lesser immortals like me couldn\u0027t hide the telltale signature that wreathed all of us, but Roman had inherited that ability from Jerome, making him the perfect spy.\\n\\n Roman shot me a wry look, then turned back to Jerome. \"When do I start?\"\\n\\n \"Immediately. Her name is Simone, and she\u0027s staying down at the Four Seasons. Go there and see what she does. Mei will relieve you off and on.\" Mei was Jerome\u0027s second-in-command demon.\\n\\n \"The Four Seasons?\" I asked. \"Is Hell paying for that? I mean, we\u0027re in a recession.\"\\n\\n Jerome sighed. \"Hell\u0027s never in a recession. And I didn\u0027t think your droll commentary started until after you\u0027d finished your coffee.\"\\n\\n I showed him my cup. It was empty.\\n\\n Jerome sighed again and then vanished without warning. He apparently had no doubts that Roman would follow his orders.\\n\\n Roman and I stood there for several quiet seconds, during which both cats resurfaced. Aubrey rubbed against Roman\u0027s bare leg, and he scratched her head.\\n\\n \"Guess I should shower and get dressed,\" he said at last, rising to his feet.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t trouble yourself,\" I said. \"And won\u0027t you be invisible anyway?\"\\n\\n He turned his back to me and walked off down the hallway. \"I was thinking of dropping off some job applications when Mei gives me a break.\"\\n\\n \"Liar,\" I said. I don\u0027t think he heard.\\n\\n It wasn\u0027t until the shower kicked on that I realized I should have asked Jerome about that weird sensation last night. It was so odd; I didn\u0027t even know how to describe it. The more I pondered it, the more I wondered if it had been alcohol-induced. Admittedly, Roman claimed he\u0027d sensed something, but he\u0027d drank as much as me.\\n\\n And speaking of jobs...my kitchen clock was telling me I needed to head off to mine. One thing about this condo was that the skyline view had come at the cost of work convenience. My old apartment had been in Queen Anne, the same neighborhood that Emerald City Books and Caf¨¦ resided in. I used to be able to walk to work, but that was impossible from West Seattle, meaning I had to allow commuting time.\\n\\n Unlike Roman, I had no need to physically shower and change - not that I wouldn\u0027t have liked to. I found human routines comforting. A brief burst of succubus shape-shifting cleaned me up, putting me in a work-appropriate peach sundress and arranging my light brown hair into a loose bun. Roman didn\u0027t surface before I had to leave, so I grabbed another cup of coffee and left him a note asking if it would kill him to take out the garbage before he went off to play secret agent.\\n\\n My headache and the last effects of the hangover were gone by the time I walked into the store. It was abuzz with late afternoon shoppers, people out running Saturday errands and tourists who had wandered over from the Space Needle and Seattle Center down the street. I dropped my purse off in my office and then did a managerial sweep of the store, satisfied that everything was running smoothly - until I noticed we had a line of eight people and only one cashier.\\n\\n \"Why are you alone?\" I asked Beth. She was a long-time employee and a good one, answering my question without even looking up from her customer\u0027s order.\\n\\n \"Gabrielle\u0027s on break, and Doug isn\u0027t...feeling well.\"\\n\\n Memories of the vodka competition came back to me. I grimaced, feeling both guilty and smug. \"Where is he?\"\\n\\n \"Over in erotica.\"\\n\\n I felt my eyebrows rise but said nothing as I turned away and walked across the store. Our small erotica section was bizarrely stuffed in between automotive and animals (amphibians, to be precise). And crammed in between the two shelves of the erotica section was Doug, sitting on the floor with his head resting facedown on his knees. I knelt beside him.\\n\\n \"Hair of the dog time?\" I asked.\\n\\n He lifted his head and brushed black hair out of his face. His expression was miserable. \"You cheated. You\u0027re like half my size. How are you not in a coma?\"\\n\\n \"Older and wiser,\" I said. If only he knew just how old. I took hold of his arm and tugged it. \"Come on. Let\u0027s go to the caf¨¦ and get you some water.\"\\n\\n For a moment, he looked like he\u0027d resist, but a valiant effort soon followed. He even managed not to stagger too much as I led him to the store\u0027s second floor, which was half books and half coffee shop.\\n\\n I grabbed a bottle of water, told the barista I\u0027d pay for it later, and started to drag Doug to a chair. As I scanned around, I nearly came to a halt, causing poor Doug to stumble. Seth was sitting at a table, laptop spread open in front of him. This was his favorite place to write, which had been nice when we dated and now was...awkward. Maddie sat with him, purse in hand and light coat on. I recalled that we started at the same time today. She must have just arrived.\\n\\n They waved us over, and she gave her brother a chastising look. \"Serves you right.\"\\n\\n Doug took a long gulp of water. \"Whatever happened to sisterly love?\"\\n\\n \"I still haven\u0027t forgiven you for the time you shaved my dachshund.\"\\n\\n \"That was like twenty years ago. And that little bastard had it coming.\"\\n\\n I smiled out of habit. Doug and Maddie\u0027s bantering was usually must-see TV for me. Today, Seth held my attention. It had been easier to ignore him last night while in the throes of alcohol, easy to pretend I\u0027d grudgingly accepted him moving on to Maddie. But now, in the cold light of sobriety, I felt that old ache stir within my chest. I swore I could smell the scent of his skin, his sweat mingled with the woodsy apple soap he used. Sunlight from the caf¨¦\u0027s large windows infused his messy brown hair with copper, and I could perfectly recall what it had been like to stroke the lines of his face, the smooth skin of his upper cheek and stubble on his chin.\\n\\n Looking up to his eyes, I was surprised to see his attention on me as the siblings continued their playful bickering. I\u0027d almost convinced myself last night that he only thought of me as a friend, but now...now I wasn\u0027t so sure. There was something warm there, something considering. Something I knew shouldn\u0027t be there. I suddenly had a sneaking suspicion that he might be remembering the handful of times we\u0027d had sex. I was thinking of it too. My powers had been shut off when Jerome disappeared, and Seth and I had been able to have \"safe\" - by which I meant, no succubus side effects - sex.\\n\\n Except for one. He\u0027d still been dating Maddie at the time, and cheating on her had tainted his soul with sin. That was worse than if I\u0027d sucked his energy away. As of this moment, Seth was a Hell-bound soul. He didn\u0027t realize that, but regret for betraying her was part of what had spurred him to a hasty engagement. He felt he owed her.\\n\\n The guilt forced me to look away from him, and I noticed then that Maddie and Doug had stopped their arguing. Maddie was glancing over at the coffee counter, but Doug\u0027s eyes were on me. They were bloodshot and weary, with heavy dark circles. But in the midst of that miserable, hungover look...there was a glint of something puzzled and surprised.\\n\\n \"Work time,\" said Maddie cheerfully, standing up. She poked her brother\u0027s shoulder, making him wince and turn his attention from me. I was glad. \"You going to survive your last couple hours?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" he muttered, drinking more water.\\n\\n \"Go count inventory in the back,\" I told him, standing as well. \"I don\u0027t want customers thinking our staff can\u0027t hold their liquor. They\u0027d be over at the chain stores so fast, it wouldn\u0027t even be funny.\"\\n\\n Maddie\u0027s lips quirked into a smile as her brother wearily rose to his feet. \"Hey, Georgina. Do you mind if Doug and I switch shifts on Tuesday? I need to go run some wedding errands during business hours.\"\\n\\n Doug cut her a look. \"When were you going to ask if I minded?\"\\n\\n \"Sure,\" I said, trying not to wince at the word \"wedding.\" \"You can work the night shift with me.\"\\n\\n \"You want to come along?\" she asked. \"You said you would.\"\\n\\n \"I did?\"\\n\\n \"Last night.\"\\n\\n I frowned. God only knew how many promises I\u0027d made and had now forgotten, thanks to vodka and weird magical forces. Vaguely, I recalled her showing me wedding pictures. \"I think I have some errands of my own to run.\"\\n\\n \"One of the places is right around the corner from you,\" she urged.\\n\\n \"Maddie,\" said Seth hastily, clearly as uncomfortable with this change of topic as I was. \"If she\u0027s busy - \"\\n\\n \"You can\u0027t be busy all day,\" Maddie begged. \"Please?\"\\n\\n I knew it was disastrous, knew it would be courting heart-ache and trouble. But Maddie was my friend, and the pleading look in her eyes did something to my insides. It was guilt, I realized. Guilt over how Seth and I had betrayed her. Her expression now was full of such faith and hope in me - me, the best friend she had in Seattle and the only one she believed could help her plan this wedding.\\n\\n Which is why I found myself agreeing, just as I had last night. Only this time, I had no alcohol to blame. \"Okay.\"\\n\\n Guilt was probably the worst culprit of all when it came to stupid behavior. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/succubus-shadows-georgina-kincaid-5/page-2.html","bookId":2058,"book":{"id":2058,"title":"Succubus Shadows (Georgina Kincaid #5)","description":"Storyline: Georgina Kincaid Book 5: Succubus Shadows \\n Something ominous is tracking reluctant succubus Georgina Kincaid through her effervescent fifth urban fantasy adventure (after 2009\u0027s Succubus Heat).
