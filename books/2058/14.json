{"id":110423,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"I was never entirely sure how much of that dream was true and how much was a lie. That it was a mix, I felt certain. I couldn\u0027t think of any reason the Oneroi would show me Kayla noticing my absence when no one else did. That had to be true. Yet, I also couldn\u0027t imagine Seth and Maddie slandering me so much. I especially couldn\u0027t imagine him breaking a confidence. Surely that was a lie...right? And as for the rest of the dream...well, it didn\u0027t matter.\n The Oneroi offered no answers. And as more and more dreams came to me, the fate they\u0027d foretold began to come true: I could no longer tell what was real and what wasn\u0027t. Often, I tried to tell myself that it was all a lie. That was easier than living with the doubt. No matter how hard I tried, though, I couldn\u0027t shake the feel of truth that some had. So, I was always questioning everything, and it grew maddening after a while. It was made worse by the fact that the Oneroi were always feeding off of those dreams, which consequently sucked up my energy. A succubus needed that energy to function. It gave me the ability to move in the world, to think clearly, to shape-shift. Draining me of it wouldn\u0027t kill me - I was still immortal, after all - but it made me useless. Not that it mattered in my prison. I still had the sensation of being crammed inside a box in the dark, and what little awareness of my body I had left was simply showing me pain and weakness. Had I been released, I would have had trouble walking. I would also likely be in my true shape.\n Since I was mostly suspended consciousness now, the physical aspects became irrelevant. My mind became the true liability, as both the lack of energy and torture from the dreams began to rip me apart. I was more coherent and analytical during the dreams themselves, but when they ended and the emotions hit me, my rational thought began fracturing. My banter with the Oneroi became primal insults and screams. Most of the time I couldn\u0027t think at all. I was just pain and despair. And rage. It seemed impossible, yet underneath the agony that smothered me, a small spark of anger just barely managed to stay alive, fueled every time I saw the Oneroi. I think holding on to that fury was the only thing that kept my shattered mind from completely giving in to insanity.\n I lost all sense of time, but that had more to do with the strange nature of dreams and not so much my brain. I actually think little time passed in the real world because every time the Oneroi showed me a glimpse of it, no progress seemed to have been made in finding me - something I believed the Oneroi hoped would break me further.\n \"Why do you keep asking us?\"\n The question came from Cody. I was now watching him, Peter, and Hugh being interrogated by Jerome. Carter sat in a far corner, smoking in spite of Peter\u0027s no-cigarettes-in-the-apartment rule. Roman was there too, invisible in body and aura. That meant I shouldn\u0027t have been able to see him, yet something - maybe because he was my target in this dream - allowed me to know he was there, despite what my senses told me. My friends knew about him. He had no need to hide his physical appearance, unless Jerome feared there might be demonic eyes watching Seattle - which wasn\u0027t that unreasonable. My disappearance had probably made him extra suspicious.\n Cody\u0027s question had been directed toward Jerome, and I had never in my life seen such fury on the young vampire\u0027s face. He was the mildest of us all, newest to Seattle\u0027s immortal circle. He still jumped when Jerome said jump and spent more time watching and learning than taking an active role. Seeing him like this was a shock.\n \"We don\u0027t know anything!\" Cody continued. \"Our powers are limited. You\u0027re the one who\u0027s supposed to be almighty and powerful. Doesn\u0027t Hell control half the universe?\"\n \"\u0027There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy,\u0027\" quoted Carter solemnly.\n \"Shut up, both of you,\" snapped Jerome. He glared at the angel. \"I\u0027ve already heard you use that one before.\"\n Carter shrugged. \"You\u0027ve heard me use all of them before. Many, many times.\"\n Jerome turned back to my three friends. \"Nothing. You\u0027re absolutely certain you noticed nothing about her before this happened?\"\n \"She was down,\" said Peter.\n \"She\u0027s always down,\" said Hugh.\n \"She didn\u0027t tell any of us about this thing she kept feeling,\" growled Cody. \"She only told Roman. Why aren\u0027t you questioning him?\"\n \"I have,\" said Jerome. He took a step near the young vampire and leaned his face in close. \"And watch your tone. You\u0027re lucky I\u0027m feeling kindly right now.\"\n \"What\u0027s Mei doing?\" asked Peter. His tone was proper and polite as he cast an uneasy glance at Cody. Half of Peter\u0027s question was probably a ploy to save his prot¨¦g¨¦ from being smote then and there.\n Jerome sighed and stepped back. \"Questioning others. Finding any trace - any at all - of another of our immortals who might have felt something.\"\n Hugh, who was sitting on the couch and keeping his distance from our angry boss, cleared his throat nervously. \"I don\u0027t want to bring this up...but, you\u0027re already kind of on probation after the, um, summoning.\"\n Jerome\u0027s smoldering gaze fell on the imp, who flinched. \"Don\u0027t you think I know that? Why is everyone here giving me useless information?\"\n \"All I\u0027m saying,\" said Hugh, \"is that if someone wanted to take advantage of the situation, making you lose one of your immortals would be a good way. Someone who, say, maybe wanted a job promotion.\"\n \"Mei couldn\u0027t do this,\" said Jerome, catching on. He\u0027d already had one lieutenant demoness turn, so Hugh\u0027s hypothesis wasn\u0027t that bad. \"She couldn\u0027t hide Georgina like this...even if she was working with someone who could, she\u0027d find a better way to get to me.\" There was almost a proud note in his voice.\n \"What about Simone?\" demanded Cody. \"She\u0027s out there impersonating Georgina, you know.\"\n Both Peter and Hugh stared in astonishment. \"She\u0027s what?\" exclaimed the imp.\n The attention from his friends seemed to fluster Cody more than Jerome\u0027s wrath. \"Yeah, I was, um, visiting Gabrielle at the bookstore, and I saw Simone. She had Georgina\u0027s shape, but I could feel it was her.\"\n \"You saw Gabrielle?\" asked Carter with interest, like my disappearance from the universe had now lessened in comparison to Cody\u0027s romance.\n Cody flushed. \"We...had a date. But I canceled it when I heard about Georgina. It\u0027s no big deal.\"\n No big deal? My kidnapping was now ruining Cody\u0027s chances with the woman of his dreams.\n \"This is more useless information,\" growled Jerome. \"And, yes, I know about Simone.\"\n \"Maybe you should be talking to her,\" said Cody.\n \"She didn\u0027t do it,\" said Jerome. The way he spoke implied that it was a closed case.\n Peter was still treading cautiously around Jerome. \"If you say she didn\u0027t...then she didn\u0027t. But why is she impersonating Georgina if she\u0027s innocent in all this?\"\n \"She has her reasons,\" said Jerome vaguely.\n Cody was outraged. \"And you\u0027re just going to let her do it! How can you?\"\n \"Because I don\u0027t care!\" roared Jerome. A wave of power flared out from him like a shock wave. Everyone except Carter was blown back by it. The china in Peter\u0027s cabinet rattled. \"I don\u0027t care what that other succubus does. I don\u0027t care about Georgina\u0027s human friends or what they think. If anything, you should be grateful. Simone\u0027s act is keeping the others from noticing what happened.\"\n None of my friends had anything to say to that. With an exasperated snarl, Jerome turned toward the door. \"I\u0027ve had enough of this. I need real answers.\"\n He stormed out into the hall, leaving the door open. Presumably, he did it as an act of angry defiance, but I knew it was so Roman could follow him. Normally, the demon would have simply teleported out, but for whatever reason, father and son were investigating together today. Once alone on the stairwell, Jerome muttered, \"Hold on.\"\n Roman must have because Jerome disappeared. He reappeared - and me along with him - in a new setting: Erik\u0027s store. It was evening, and Erik had shut down for the night. The fountains were off. The music had stopped playing. Yet, near the back of the store, a few notes of humming could be heard. They cut off almost immediately, and footsteps sounded as someone approached.\n Jerome stayed where he was, not deigning to move. He knew his presence would have been promptly felt. He knew Erik would come to him.\n And sure enough, gait still unsteady from being sick recently, Erik made his way to the store\u0027s front. He radiated wariness as he moved. For me, he always had a kindly smile and cup of tea. Even Carter, the most powerful immortal in Seattle, would earn a respectful smile. But Erik was on his guard now - which really wasn\u0027t that weird, considering who stood in his store.\n Erik came to a stop a few feet from Jerome and straightened himself up as well as he could to his full height. He gave Jerome the smallest nod of greeting.\n \"Mr. Hanan\u0027el,\" said Erik. \"An unexpected visit.\"\n Jerome had just taken a cigarette out of his coat, and it fell from his fingers. The look he gave Erik was a hundred times more terrifying than anything I\u0027d ever seen. I expected another flare-up of power, one that would blow the entire building apart.\n \"Do not,\" said Jerome, \"ever let that name cross your lips again, or I will rip them off.\" His voice was low and even, simmering with the rage and power he was holding back.\n Had I been there, I would have gasped. Jerome\u0027s true name. Erik knew Jerome\u0027s true name. I used fake names to blend in and forget my identity. But for angels and demons, names were power. In the right hands, a name could be used to summon or control a greater immortal. In fact, for Dante to have summoned Jerome in the spring, Grace must have revealed that name.\n Erik didn\u0027t flinch at Jerome being in smite mode. \"I assume,\" said Erik, \"you are seeking something.\"\n \"Yes,\" said Jerome, slightly mimicking Erik\u0027s tone. \"I am \u0027seeking\u0027 my succubus.\"\n Erik\u0027s eyebrows rose slightly. \"Miss Kincaid?\"\n \"Of course! Who else?\" Jerome did technically have another succubus, Tawny. But maybe he wouldn\u0027t have gone hunting for her if she disappeared. He took out another cigarette and lit it without a lighter. \"Do you know where she is? And don\u0027t lie to me. If you\u0027re keeping her from me, I will rip you apart, leaving your tongue for last.\"\n \"Ripping body parts appears to be a theme tonight,\" replied Erik, clasping his hands behind his back. \"But no, I don\u0027t know where Miss Kincaid is. I didn\u0027t know she was missing.\"\n Jerome took a step forward, eyes narrowed. \"I told you, do not lie to me.\"\n \"I have no reason to lie. I like Miss Kincaid. I would never wish her harm. If I can help her, I will.\" Erik\u0027s wording was careful. It was me he was offering to help - not Jerome.\n \"She spoke to you about some force - some \u0027siren song\u0027 that kept coming to her,\" said Jerome. He gave a curt report of what Roman had observed when I disappeared. \"What do you know about this thing? What kind of creature was it? It was feeding off her depression.\"\n From the moment this dream had started, Jerome had displayed nothing but rage and terror. Yet...as he shot off questions, it was almost like he was rambling. There was desperation under all that anger. Desperation and frustration because he was in a situation with no answers and felt powerless. Demons, as a general rule, do not like feeling powerless. Resorting to human help - a human who knew his name, no less - must have been excruciatingly painful for my boss.\n Erik, classy as always, remained calm and formal. \"There are creatures who do that, yes, but I don\u0027t believe it was one of those. I believe it chose those times because she was weakest. It was simply a lure - probably not the creature or culprit itself.\"\n \"Then what creature is it?\"\n Erik spread his hands wide. \"It could be any number of things.\"\n \"God-fucking-damn-it,\" said Jerome, dropping his cigarette onto Erik\u0027s floor and stomping on it hard.\n \"You\u0027re no longer connected to her?\"\n \"Correct.\"\n \"You have no awareness of her - one of your kind isn\u0027t masking her?\"\n \"Correct.\"\n \"And you know she\u0027s not dead?\"\n \"Correct.\"\n Erik\u0027s brown eyes were thoughtful. \"Then the creature is likely one outside of your scope.\"\n \"Why,\" asked Jerome wearily, \"does everyone keep telling me things I already know?\" The question could have been directed to Erik, Roman, or the air. The demon took out another cigarette.\n \"You need to figure out who would take her and why. She has enemies. Nyx was not pleased with the resolution of her last visit.\"\n \"Nyx is locked up.\" Jerome spoke as though he had stated that a hundred times. I was pretty sure he\u0027d been asked all those questions about me a hundred times too.\n \"Your summoner, Mr. Moriarty, was not overly pleased with her either.\" Although Erik remained professional, his lips twisted ever so slightly, like he\u0027d tasted something bitter. Regardless of his feelings for the demon, both Erik and Jerome shared a mutual hatred of Dante.\n This gave Jerome pause. \"I doubt this was human magic, though I suppose he could have had help - he\u0027s sought allies before. I\u0027ll look into it.\" He dropped this new cigarette and stepped on it too. \"Regardless, I still can\u0027t believe I\u0027d have no sense of her in the world.\"\n \"Maybe she\u0027s not in this world.\"\n Erik\u0027s words hung between them for several seconds.\n \"No,\" said Jerome at last. \"Many have interest in her - but none who would do that.\"\n I saw in Erik\u0027s face that the words \"Many have interest in her\" had caught his notice. He stayed silent, however, and waited for Jerome\u0027s next profound statement. Which wasn\u0027t that profound.\n \"Time to go,\" said the demon, probably so Roman could grab hold again.\n Jerome teleported, off to wherever it was he had to go.\n And me? I returned to my prison. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/succubus-shadows-georgina-kincaid-5/page-14.html","bookId":2058,"book":{"id":2058,"title":"Succubus Shadows (Georgina Kincaid #5)","description":"Storyline: \n Georgina Kincaid Book 5: Succubus Shadows \n Something ominous is tracking reluctant succubus Georgina Kincaid through her effervescent fifth urban fantasy adventure (after 2009\u0027s Succubus Heat).
