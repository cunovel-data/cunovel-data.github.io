{"id":110418,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"\"She couldn\u0027t have!\" I exclaimed. \"He was with me all night.\"\n \"Not after the concert ended,\" pointed out Roman. \"You know, I think that band might really be going somewhere.\" Whatever trace of sentiment he\u0027d shown earlier with me had vanished in Carter\u0027s presence.\n \"Simone was hanging out in that twenty-four-hour coffee shop,\" Carter said. \"Seth went there to work after - what was it you said? You were at a concert?\"\n \"Yeah,\" I said. \"Blue Satin Bra.\"\n The angel gave Roman a nod of agreement. \"Those guys are great.\"\n \"Hey, can we stick to the issue here?\" I gave both of them glares. \"What happened with Seth and Simone?\"\n Carter shrugged. \"Same as usual. He came in and noticed her first, though. She had her head in a book - didn\u0027t even look up until he walked over.\"\n \"Well played,\" I said. \"Forces him into the aggressive role.\"\n \"I don\u0027t think Seth\u0027s ever really in an aggressive role,\" mused Carter. \"It just put him in a position to make the first move, if he wanted to be polite.\"\n During our brief affair, Seth and I had made love so tenderly and so sweetly that poets would have wept at its beauty. Other times, things had been downright dirty, and I think Carter might have reconsidered his comment about Seth being aggressive, had the angel known.\n \"Then what?\" I demanded.\n \"Like I said, the same. They talked about different things - a lot of topics interesting to Seth, really. I think she might have done some research on him.\"\n \"Fucking lovely.\" I collapsed onto the couch, and then I promptly shot back up. \"I\u0027m going over there - \"\n \"Gone,\" interrupted Carter. \"They went separate ways, and then she bagged some guy, and I decided it was time for me to fly away.\"\n \"Lucky bastard,\" grumbled Roman. \"You have no idea what kind of shit I had to sit through.\"\n The hint of a smile flickered on Carter\u0027s face before he turned back to me. I sighed and sat back down. \"Confronting her\u0027s no good anyway. You already did it, and nothing came of it. I\u0027m guessing this would just be a repeat.\"\n Probably a good point. Being in a conflict with a succubus kind of sucked. I could punch Hugh or the vampires, and even with immortal healing, they\u0027d still sport a black eye for a few hours - longer if I was really good. But with a succubus? I could smack her around, and she\u0027d shape-shift the damage. And as for verbal fighting? Well, seeing as I had no real leverage, I\u0027d probably just fuel her further and provide more cat fight entertainment for my friends.\n \"Well,\" I said to Roman. \"I think I\u0027m pissed off enough now that you don\u0027t have to go to bed with me.\"\n Carter\u0027s eyebrow rose again.\n \"I mean, he doesn\u0027t have to watch me sleep,\" I explained. \"I was kind of glum earlier, and we were worried my mystery...thing...might show up again.\"\n \"Why glum?\" asked Carter. He attempted innocence, but I wasn\u0027t fooled. Even without being at the concert, he could easily figure out what had me down.\n \"Long story.\"\n Those silvery gray eyes bored into me, and I shifted and looked away. I hated when he did that. It was like he could see into my soul. That was a place I didn\u0027t even want to look at - let alone have others do it. I attempted a change in subject.\n \"You know, I was thinking about this thing that\u0027s going on...this force or siren song or whatever. It\u0027s not like what happened with Nyx, but there\u0027s still a dreamlike quality to it, you know? I mean, it certainly seems like I\u0027m sleepwalking. Do you think she could be back?\"\n \"Nope,\" said Carter. \"She\u0027s definitely still locked up. I checked myself.\"\n \"Really?\"\n \"Really.\"\n I didn\u0027t follow up with the obvious question. Had Carter done it for me? I mean, checking up on Nyx probably wasn\u0027t too hard for him. He probably just asked some angel buddy who asked another angel...etc. It still made me wonder about Carter\u0027s endgame. Why go to such trouble for me? Why look into this? Why track Simone?\n His expression made me think he guessed my thoughts, something I hated. \"Thanks,\" I said. \"But I think I\u0027m heading to bed now.\"\n \"And I,\" said Carter, \"am going to get a drink.\"\n \"Done with Simone for good?\" asked Roman.\n Carter made a dismissive gesture. \"At least for tonight. I\u0027ll find her in the morning.\"\n \"You\u0027re kind of a slacker spy,\" I pointed out, though I definitely understood his reasons for avoiding the other succubus\u0027 liaisons.\n His only response was another smile before he vanished.\n \"Now what?\" I wondered aloud.\n \"Now,\" said Roman, \"you get your beauty sleep so that I can have another captivating day of listening to you give recommendations for people who enjoyed The Da Vinci Code.\"\n \"You know you love it,\" I said, walking off toward my bedroom.\n \"Sure you don\u0027t want company?\"\n I glanced back at him and studied his face, the lovely lines of it and blue-green eyes like the Mediterranean of my youth. His expression was speculative, wry humor twisting his lips. I couldn\u0027t entirely tell if he was joking. Or what his exact meaning was.\n \"Positive.\"\n My words were a little bolder than I felt, but the night passed uneventfully, again furthering the idea that my blue moods were the target. Consequently, this put me in a good mood when I went to work the next day. I even wore yellow in an attempt at further cheeriness and greeted my coworkers with such enthusiasm that Doug wanted to know what drugs I was taking - and if he could have some.\n All of that changed when, while headed for the science fiction section, I felt something totally unwelcome: an immortal signature. A succubus immortal signature. And I knew exactly which succubus it belonged to. I did a 180, took a few steps, and tried to pinpoint its direction. Fiction.\n I headed straight over there, and sure enough, there was Simone - with Seth. She wore that guise I\u0027d heard reports of, the bookish - yet sexy - brunette. They were standing by Seth\u0027s section, and she was holding up one of his paperbacks, Idiosyncraso. I knew she could feel my signature as I approached, but her eyes stayed on Seth, her conversation not missing a beat.\n \"You really wrote this in college?\"\n \"Yup,\" he said. \"It wasn\u0027t the first I had published, though. I shelved it for years before digging it out and revising it.\"\n \"Cool,\" she said, flipping through the pages. \"I can\u0027t wait to read it. It\u0027ll give me something to do before your next one.\"\n \"Well, don\u0027t get your - oh, hey.\"\n Seth had spotted me. I came to a stop beside them, and Simone turned toward me politely.\n \"How\u0027s it going?\" I asked, voice harsher than I intended.\n Seth, always sensitive to me, looked a little surprised at my tone but didn\u0027t acknowledge it. \"Fine. Georgina, this is Kelly. Kelly, Georgina. Georgina\u0027s the manager here.\"\n \"Hi, Kelly.\"\n I shook her hand with a hardness she matched, and we both continued grinning at each other like Stepford Wives.\n \"I met Kelly at a coffee shop,\" said Seth mildly, not aware he was in succubus crossfire. \"Told her she should see the store sometime.\"\n \"It\u0027s great,\" said Simone, all adorable innocence. \"I\u0027m a big reader. I love all things books. And meeting one of my favorite authors has given me great insight.\"\n \"Well,\" said Seth, a little embarrassed at the attention. \"I don\u0027t know how much insight I\u0027m really offering.\"\n Simone laughed. \"Lots. I feel like I\u0027m getting something from you each time I see you.\"\n \"Have you seen each other a lot?\" I asked.\n \"Kelly moved to Queen Anne,\" said Seth. \"So we keep running into each other.\"\n \"It\u0027s a great area,\" I said. \"Where do you live?\"\n Simone faltered. \"Um, on Queen Anne.\"\n \"Street, Avenue, or Drive?\"\n Seth seemed surprised at the interrogative style of the question. Simone turned nervous. \"Eh, Avenue.\"\n Damn. Lucky guess. Queen Anne Street didn\u0027t exist.\n \"Nice place.\" Turning my back on her, I looked at Seth. \"I came over because I heard someone say Maddie was looking for you.\" That wasn\u0027t true at all. Maddie wasn\u0027t even in for another hour. I gave Simone a casual glance. \"Maddie\u0027s his fianc¨¦e.\"\n \"I didn\u0027t think she was in yet,\" said Seth.\n Why, of all days, would his memory be up and running today? \"Maybe I misheard,\" I said with a shrug. \"But I figured you\u0027d want to check.\"\n \"I will,\" he said, still a little puzzled. \"I need to show Kelly one more book.\"\n She shot me a triumphant look, but I knew she\u0027d accomplished nothing with Seth. He had that expression he got when he was so focused on something - in this case, the history of books - that he was distracted from the world. \"Kelly\" was a pleasant coincidence. Simone was too overconfident to notice.\n Seth turned back to the shelves, and me staying would have seemed awkward. With his attention elsewhere, I shot Simone a warning look. \"Well, I\u0027m sure I\u0027ll see you around.\"\n \"Oh,\" she said with a serene smile, \"you will.\"\n When I got home later that day, I was ready to break some furniture. \"Did you see - \"\n \"Yes, yes, I saw,\" said Roman, materializing beside me. \"Calm down.\"\n I let out a small cry of frustration, something primal with no real form. \"I can\u0027t believe that bitch! Can\u0027t believe she\u0027d actually do it right in front of me! She did it on purpose. She did it on purpose to taunt me.\"\n Roman was the picture of tranquility as he leaned against the wall, a far cry from my frazzled, pacing state. \"Of course she did. It\u0027s like mobsters who threaten their victims in a crowd - there\u0027s absolutely no way you could have fought back, not with that many witnesses.\"\n \"Nice analogy,\" I muttered. \"Maybe there\u0027ll be a horse head in my bed next.\"\n \"I could leave one in hers, if it would help,\" he offered.\n That almost made me smile. Almost. Except I wasn\u0027t entirely sure he was joking. \"The really comical part is that Seth brought it about, you know? He was trying to stay away from me and walked right into this.\"\n \"The road to Hell is paved with good intentions.\"\n I didn\u0027t dignify that with an answer.\n \"Look,\" he said in all seriousness, taking a few steps toward me. \"It sucks that she\u0027s doing this, and we can definitely rule out coincidence. But if Seth\u0027s with Maddie while she\u0027s there, you know nothing\u0027s going to happen. And Carter will report back to us. No point in getting worked up over it.\"\n \"Easier said than done. Nothing\u0027s going to distract me from this.\"\n He moved closer still and rested his hands on my upper arms. \"Oh? When was the last time you went dancing?\"\n I blinked in surprise. The last time I\u0027d been dancing? It had been a salsa lesson at the bookstore earlier this year, after which Seth and I had ripped each other\u0027s clothes off in my office.\n \"A while ago,\" I said evasively, thrown off by both the question and his fingertips on my skin. \"Why?\"\n \"Let\u0027s go out,\" he said. \"There are a million places we can go. Any kind of dance you want. If memory serves, you\u0027re an okay dancer.\"\n I narrowed my eyes. \"I\u0027m an excellent dancer, and you know it.\"\n He leaned his face closer. \"Then prove it.\"\n \"Irrelevant. I don\u0027t feel like going out.\"\n Roman sighed and stepped away. I found I was a little disappointed to have him let go. \"Man,\" he said. \"I remember when you used to be fun. I\u0027m glad I left town when I did.\" He walked over to my entertainment center and knelt down. \"Well, if Muhammed won\u0027t come to the mountain...\"\n \"Good grief. You\u0027re a wealth of religious proverbs tonight, aren\u0027t you?\"\n \"Hey, just trying to - Jesus Christ. CDs? You do know the Dark Ages ended a long time ago.\" He pointed at my collection with disdain. \"Everyone\u0027s gone digital now. You know, those little magical devices that store music? Or do you consider them some kind of witchcraft?\"\n \"Technology changes every year. Jump on a fad, and you\u0027re obsolete before you know it.\"\n \"Honestly, it\u0027s a wonder you aren\u0027t cooking over a fire in the middle of your living room.\"\n \"You forget - I don\u0027t cook.\"\n \"I live here. I haven\u0027t forgotten.\"\n By then, he\u0027d put one of my \"archaic\" CDs in the player. I laughed. \"You\u0027re one to talk about ancient history. This is old school.\"\n \"Nah.\" He rose and offered me his hands. \"This is classic. Never goes out of style.\"\n \"Yeah,\" I said, as the music began playing. \"All the kids are doing foxtrot nowadays. Geez, it\u0027s even the slow style.\" But I still let him take hold of my hands.\n \"Hey, you\u0027re the one who owns that CD.\"\n We both fell into the steps effortlessly, gliding around the living room and managing to dodge the furniture with some grace. Roman had a long list of flaws, but one of his better traits was that he was almost as good a dancer as me.\n \"Why do you dance so well?\" I asked, stepping over Aubrey. She didn\u0027t seem concerned at all about getting squashed and had shown no signs of moving when we began to dance.\n \"What kind of a question is that? Why do you dance so well?\"\n \"Natural instinct, I guess. That\u0027s what I\u0027m wondering. Was it something you were born with? Or is it something you can\u0027t help but perfect over the years? I mean, you\u0027ve been around for a while. I suppose if you put your mind to something that long, you can\u0027t help but master it.\"\n He laughed. \"To tell you the truth, I don\u0027t know. Maybe it\u0027s in the blood.\"\n \"Oh, come on. I cannot picture Jerome out on the dance floor.\"\n \"Not him. My mother. She was a dancer. A slave girl for this king a long, long time ago...\" Roman\u0027s gaze turned inward. He didn\u0027t seem angry, so much as nostalgic. \"Of course, he was pretty pissed off when she got pregnant. That kind of thing tends to ruin the chorus line.\"\n \"What happened to her?\" I hadn\u0027t been around that long ago, but certain things stayed the same through time. Slaves who angered their masters got beaten or sold to someone else. Or worse.\n \"I don\u0027t know. Jerome took her away, off to some village where she could be a free woman.\"\n I frowned. I still had trouble wrapping my mind around the idea of my boss falling - romantically and divinely - for a mortal. \"Did he stay with her? He would have been a demon by then....\"\n \"He never came back. First time I saw him was last year. My mother didn\u0027t hold a grudge, though. She would talk about him all the time...said he was beautiful. I don\u0027t know if she meant as an angel or a demon, though. Probably he looked the same, seeing as they\u0027re the same beings, really.\"\n \"I\u0027m guessing he didn\u0027t look like John Cusack though.\"\n \"No.\" This made Roman laugh again. \"Probably not. My mother took on mundane jobs whenever we moved villages - washing woman, field worker. But at least she was free. And she still danced sometimes. I saw her once, when I was really young...just before she was killed. There was a festival, and I remember her dancing in front of the fire, wearing this red dress.\" All mirth disappeared from him. \"That image is burned into my mind. I can see how an angel would have fallen for her.\"\n I didn\u0027t ask any questions about how she was killed. In those days, it could have been as simple as a raid or attack. They were commonplace. Or, more likely, she\u0027d been killed in an attempt on Roman and his sister. He\u0027d once mentioned that they were always on the run from angels and demons.\n \"So maybe you learned to dance as a subconscious tribute to her,\" I said, shifting to something lighter.\n That half-smile returned. \"Or maybe I just inherited my father\u0027s attraction to graceful, sensual women.\"\n The song ended, and we stood there, frozen in time with our hands still entwined. Foxtrot was hardly the bumping and grinding seen in modern clubs, but our bodies were close, and I felt like I could sense the heat from his. Whether it was real or imagined, I couldn\u0027t say. But I did know there was something very seductive about dancing, about mirroring another\u0027s body, and somehow, I wasn\u0027t surprised when he leaned down and kissed me.\n I was a little surprised that I kissed him back. But not for long. Because as our lips met, I realized how much I\u0027d come to regard Roman as a comforting fixture in my life. We\u0027d grown from adversaries to friends to...what? I didn\u0027t entirely know. I did know that I liked having him around and that I\u0027d never really shaken the attraction that had drawn me to him long ago. I also knew that I was lonely for the touch of someone I liked and that I had an automatic instinct to respond to this sort of thing.\n His mouth pressed harder against mine, as hot and demanding as I recalled. His hands quickly moved from the formal orientation of foxtrot to something more intimate and eager, sliding down to my hips and somehow managing to push me against the wall while also shoving my shirt up. My own hands were around his neck, my lower body pressing against his as I felt all my nerves set on fire and lust coursing through me.\n He managed to break away enough to pull my shirt off, and then his hands moved to my breasts, which were wrapped in a white lace bra. He glanced down and made a face as he pulled from our kiss. \"Can\u0027t you make it a front hook?\"\n A small bit of shape-shifting made the bra disappear altogether. \"Don\u0027t trouble yourself,\" I said.\n He smiled and moved his lips to my neck while his hands cupped the curves of my breasts. It made it impossible for me to take his shirt off, but I slid my hands under it, loving the feel of his warm skin and taut muscles. I tipped my head back, letting him taste me and increase the intensity of his kissing.\n And through it all, there were no voices in my head. I heard none of his thoughts, sensed none of his feelings. I was alone - alone with my own reactions, simply enjoying the way my body felt with no other interruptions. It was glorious.\n I at last managed a break that let me pull his shirt off, and then my hands moved to his pants, putting us in a brief deadlock as he tried to move his lips to my nipples. I won and watched his pants fall to the floor. With that concession, he pulled me down as well and continued his efforts to kiss my breasts, almost kneeling before me as he did so. I ran my hands through his hair, gripping his head while his mouth sucked and teased. As he did, his eyes glanced up and met mine. I saw the desire in them and - something more.\n Something I hadn\u0027t expected to see. There was...what? Love? Adoration? Affection? I couldn\u0027t quite pin it down, but I recognized the general category. It was a slap to the face. I hadn\u0027t anticipated it. Lust, I\u0027d expected. A primitive instinct to throw me down and fuck me, in order to relieve his body\u0027s need. For so long, I\u0027d operated on the assumption that he kind of liked me and kind of wanted to hate me. Yet, now, I realized those nice moments we\u0027d had recently weren\u0027t coincidence. His sharp attitude had been a facade, meant to hide his feelings.\n Roman still loved me.\n I identified it for what it was. He wasn\u0027t doing this just because he wanted my body. He wanted me. This was more than just fulfilling a physical instinct for him, and suddenly...suddenly, I didn\u0027t know what to do. Because I realized then, I didn\u0027t know why I was doing this. There was a fair amount of lust on my part, and I\u0027d grown closer to him since his return to Seattle. But the rest...? I wasn\u0027t sure. There was so much going on right now: Maddie, Simone, Seth...Always Seth. Seth, who even now made my heart ache while I was wrapped in the arms of another man. My emotions were a tangle of confusion and hurt and desperation. I was with Roman as some sort of reaction, some attempt to fill the hole in my heart and seek false comfort. My feelings didn\u0027t match his. I couldn\u0027t do this with him. I didn\u0027t deserve to do this with him.\n I pushed him away and jumped to my feet, backing off toward the hallway.\n \"No...\" I said. \"I can\u0027t...I can\u0027t. I\u0027m sorry.\"\n He stared up at me, understandably confused and a little hurt after the ardor I\u0027d displayed seconds ago. \"What are you talking about? What\u0027s wrong?\"\n I didn\u0027t know how to explain it, didn\u0027t know how I could even begin to articulate what I felt inside of me. I just shook my head and continued backing. \"I\u0027m sorry...I\u0027m so sorry...I\u0027m just not ready.\"\n Roman sprang to his feet in one graceful motion. He took a step toward me. \"Georgina...\"\n But I was already moving away, off to the safety of my bedroom. I slammed the door behind me - not from anger, but from a desperate need to stay away from him. From the hall, I heard him call my name and feared he\u0027d come in anyway, despite my refusal to answer. I had no lock, and even if I did, it wouldn\u0027t stop him. He said my name a few more times, and then silence fell. I think he returned to the living room, backing off and giving me my space.\n I flung myself onto the bed, gripping the sheets tightly and trying not to cry. That horrible despair that plagued me so often filled me now. It was an old friend, one that I would never be able to leave. All my relationships - friends and lovers - were a mess. I was either hurting them, or they were hurting me. There was no peace for me. There never would be, not for this servant of Hell.\n And then, through that horrible, clenching pain inside me, I felt the lightest of touches. A whisper. A breath of music, of color, of light. I lifted my head up from where I\u0027d buried it in my pillow and stared around. There was nothing tangible, not exactly, but I could sense it all around me: that warm, comforting siren song. It had no words, yet in my despair, I could hear it perfectly. It was telling me I was wrong, that I could have peace. And not just that - I could have comfort and love and so much more. It was like arms beckoning to me, a mother welcoming home a long-lost child.\n I slowly rose from my bed, moving toward that which had no form. Come, come.\n Outside my door, I heard Roman shout my name, but the tone was different from before. This wasn\u0027t confusion or pleading. It was frantic and concerned. The sound was grating to my ears as I stepped closer to that beautiful warmth. It was home. It was an invitation. All I had to do was accept.\n \"Georgina!\" The door blew apart, and Roman stood there, blazing with power. \"Georgina, stop - \"\n But it was too late. I had accepted.\n All that joy and protection wrapped around me, taking me into its arms.\n The world dissolved. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/succubus-shadows-georgina-kincaid-5/page-9.html","bookId":2058,"book":{"id":2058,"title":"Succubus Shadows (Georgina Kincaid #5)","description":"Storyline: \n Georgina Kincaid Book 5: Succubus Shadows \n Something ominous is tracking reluctant succubus Georgina Kincaid through her effervescent fifth urban fantasy adventure (after 2009\u0027s Succubus Heat).
