{"id":108787,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"Damon had to wait some hours for another opportunity to feed - there were too many girls in deep sleep - and he was furious. The hunger that the manipulative creature had roused in him was real, even if it hadn\u0027t succeeded in making him its puppet. He needed blood; and he needed itsoon . Only then would he think over the implications of Caroline\u0027s strange mirror-guest: that trulydemonic demon lover who had handed her over to Damon to be killed, even while pretending to make a deal with her. NineA.M . saw him driving down the main street of the town, past an antique store, eateries, a shop for greeting cards. Wait. There it was. A new store that sold sunglasses. He parked and got out of the car with an elegance of motion born of centuries of careless movement that wasted not an erg of energy. Once again, Damon flashed the instantaneous smile, and then he turned it off, admiring himself in the dark glass of the window. Yes, no matter how you look at it, I am gorgeous, he thought absently. The door had a bell that made a tinkling sound as he entered. Inside was a plump and very pretty girl with brown hair tied back and large blue eyes. She had seen Damon and she was smiling shyly. \"Hi.\" And though he hadn\u0027t asked, she added, in a voice that quavered, \"I\u0027m Page.\" Damon gave her a long, unhurried look that ended in a smile, slow and brilliant and complicit. \"Hello, Page,\" he said, drawing it out. Page swallowed. \"Can I help you?\" \"Oh, yes,\" Damon said, holding her with his eyes, \"I think so.\" He turned serious. \"Did you know,\" he said, \"that you really belong as a chatelaine in a castle in the Middle Ages?\" Page went white, then blushed furiously - and looked all the better for it. \"I - I always wished that I\u0027d been born back then. But how could you know that?\" Damon just smiled. Elena looked at Stefan with wide eyes that were the dark blue of lapis lazuli with a scattering of gold. He\u0027d just told her that she was going to have Visitors! In all the seven days of her life, since she had returned from the afterlife, she had never - ever - had a Visitor. First thing, right away, was to find out what a Visitor was. Fifteen minutes after entering the sunglasses shop, Damon was walking down the sidewalk, wearing a brand-new pair of Ray-Bans and whistling. Page was taking a little nap on the floor. Later, her boss would threaten to make her pay for the Ray-Bans herself. But right now she felt warm and deliriously happy - and she had a memory of ecstasy that she would never entirely forget. Damon window-shopped, although not exactly the way a human would. A sweet old woman behind the counter of the greeting cards shop...no. A guy at the electronics shop...no. But...something drew him back to the electronics shop. Such clever devices they were inventing these days. He had a strong urge to acquire a palm-sized video camera. Damon was used to following his urges and was not picky about donors in an emergency. Blood was blood, whatever vessel it came in. A few minutes after he\u0027d been shown how to work the little toy, he was walking down the sidewalk with it in his pocket. He was enjoying just walking, although his fangs were aching again. Strange, he should be sated - but then, he\u0027d had almost nothing yesterday. That must be why he still felt hungry; that and the Power he\u0027d used on the damnable parasite in Caroline\u0027s room. But meanwhile he took pleasure in the way his muscles were working together smoothly and without effort, like a well-oiled machine, making every movement a delight. He stretched once, for the pure animal enjoyment of it, and then stopped again to examine himself in the window of the antiques store. Slightly more disheveled, but otherwise as beautiful as ever. And he\u0027d been right; the Ray-Bans looked wicked on him. The antiques store was owned, he knew, by a widow with a very pretty, very young niece. It was dim and air-conditioned inside. \"Do you know,\" he asked the niece when she came to wait on him, \"that you strike me as someone who would like to see a lot of foreign countries?\" Some time after Stefan explained to Elena that Visitors were her friends, hergood friends, he wanted her to get dressed. Elena didn\u0027t understand why. It was hot. She had given in to wearing a Night Gown (for at least most of the night), but the daytime was even warmer, and she didn\u0027t have a Day Gown. Besides, the clothes he was offering her - a pair of his jeans rolled up at the hems and a polo shirt that would be much too big - were...wrong somehow. When she touched the shirt she got pictures of hundreds of women in small rooms, all using sewing machines in bad light, all working frantically. \"From a sweat shop?\" Stefan said, startled, when she showed him the picture in her mind.\"These?\" He dropped the clothes on the floor of the closet hastily. \"What about this one?\" Stefan handed her a different shirt. Elena studied it soberly, held it to her cheek. No sweating, frantically sewing women. \"Okay?\" Stefan said. But Elena had frozen. She went to the window and peered out. \"What\u0027s wrong?\" This time, she sent him only one picture. He recognized it immediately. Damon. Stefan felt a tightening in his chest. His older brother had been making Stefan\u0027s existence as miserable as possible for nearly half a millennium. Every time that Stefan had managed to get away from him, Damon had tracked him down, looking for...what? Revenge? Some final satisfaction? They had killed each other at the same instant, back in Renaissance Italy. Their fencing swords had pierced each other\u0027s hearts almost simultaneously, in a duel over a vampire girl. Things had only gone downhill from there. But he\u0027s saved your life a few times, too, Stefan thought, suddenly discomfited. And you promised you\u0027d watch out for each other, take care of each other.... Stefan looked sharply at Elena.She was the one who\u0027d made both of them take the same oath - when she was dying. Elena looked back with eyes that were limpid, deep blue pools of innocence. In any case, he had to deal with Damon, who was now parking his Ferrari beside Stefan\u0027s Porsche in front of the boardinghouse. \"Stay in here and - and keep away from the window.Please ,\" Stefan hastily told Elena. He dashed out of the room, shut the door, and almost ran down the steps. He found Damon standing by the Ferrari, examining the dilapidated boardinghouse\u0027s exterior - first with sunglasses on, then with them off. Damon\u0027s expression said that it didn\u0027t make a great deal of difference whichever way you looked at it. But that wasn\u0027t Stefan\u0027s first concern. It was Damon\u0027s aura and the variety of different scents lingering on him - which no human nose would ever be able to detect, much less untangle. \"What have you beendoing ?\" Stefan said, too shocked for even a perfunctory greeting. Damon gave him a 250-watt smile. \"Antiquing,\" he said, and sighed. \"Oh, and I did some shopping.\" He fingered a new leather belt, touched the pocket with the video camera, and pushed back his Ray-Bans. \"Would you believe it, this little dust speck of a town has some pretty decent shopping. I like shopping.\" \"You like stealing, you mean. And that doesn\u0027t account for half of what I can smell on you. Are you dying or have you just gone crazy?\" Sometimes, when a vampire had been poisoned or had succumbed to one of the few mysterious curses or illnesses that afflict their kind, they would feed feverishly, uncontrollably, on whatever - whomever - was at hand. \"Just hungry,\" Damon replied urbanely, still surveying the boardinghouse. \"And what happened to basic civility, by the way? I drive all the way out here and do I get a \u0026iexcl;\u0026reg;Hello, Damon,\u0027 or \u0026iexcl;\u0026reg;Nice to see you, Damon\u0027? No. Instead I hear \u0026iexcl;\u0026reg;What have you been doing, Damon?\u0027\" He gave the imitation a whining, mocking twist. \"I wonder what Signore Marino would think of that, little brother?\" \"Signore Marino,\" Stefan said through his teeth, wondering how Damon was able to get under his skin every time - today with a reference to their old tutor of etiquette and dancing - \"has been dust for hundreds of years by now - as we should be, too. Which has nothing to do with this conversation, brother . I asked you what you were doing, and you know what I meant by it - you must have bled half the girls in town.\" \"Girls and women,\" Damon reproved, holding up a finger facetiously. \"We must be politically correct, after all. And maybe you should be taking a closer look at your own diet. If you drank more, you might begin to fill out. Who knows?\" \"If I drank more - ?\" There were a number of ways to finish this sentence, but no good ones. \"What a pity,\" he said instead to the short, slim, and compact Damon, \"thatyou\u0027ll never grow another millimeter taller however long you live. And now, why don\u0027t you tell me what you\u0027re doing here, after leaving so many messes in town for me to clean up - if I know you.\" \"I\u0027m here because I want my leather jacket back,\" Damon said flatly. \"Why not just steal anoth - ?\" Stefan broke off as he suddenly found himself flying briefly backward and then pinned against the groaning boards of the boardinghouse wall, with Damon right in his face. \"I didn\u0027t steal these things,boy . I paid for them - in my own coin. Dreams, fantasies, and pleasure from beyond this world.\" Damon said the last words with emphasis, since he knew they would infuriate Stefan the most. Stefanwas infuriated - and in a dilemma. He knew Damon was curious about Elena. That was bad enough. But right now he could also see a strange gleam in Damon\u0027s eyes. As if the pupils had, for a moment, reflected a flame. And whatever Damon had been doing today was abnormal. Stefan didn\u0027t know what was going on, but he knew just how Damon was going to finish this off. \"But a real vampire shouldn\u0027t pay,\" Damon was saying in his most taunting tones. \"After all, we\u0027re so wicked that we ought to be dust. Isn\u0027t that right, little brother?\" He held up the hand with the finger on which he wore the lapis lazuli ring that kept him from crumbling to dust in the golden afternoon sunlight. And then, as Stefan made a movement, Damon used that hand to pin Stefan\u0027s wrist to the wall. Stefan feinted to the left and then lunged right to break Damon\u0027s hold on him. But Damon was fast as a snake - no, faster. Much faster than usual. Fast and strong with all the energy of the life force he\u0027d absorbed. \"Damon, you...\" Stefan was so angry that he briefly lost his hold on rational thought and tried to swipe Damon\u0027s legs out from under him. \"Yes, it\u0027s me, Damon,\" Damon said with jubilant venom. \"And I don\u0027t pay if I don\u0027t feel like it; I just take. Itake what I want, and I give nothing in return.\" Stefan stared into those heated black-on-black eyes and again saw the tiny flicker of flame. He tried to think. Damon was always quick to attack, to take offense. Butnot like this . Stefan had known him long enough to know something was off; something was wrong. Damon seemed almost feverish. Stefan sent a small surge of Power toward his brother, like a radar sweep, trying to put his finger on what was different. \"Yes, I see you\u0027ve got the idea, but you\u0027ll never get anywhere that way,\" Damon said wryly, and then suddenly Stefan\u0027s insides, his entire body was on fire, was in agony, as Damon lashed out with a violent whip of his own Power. And now, however bad the pain was, Stefan had to be coldly rational; he had to keepthinking , not just reacting. He made a small movement, twisting his neck to the side, looking toward the door of the boardinghouse. If only Elena would stay inside... But it was hard to think with Damon still whiplashing him. He was breathing fast and hard. \"That\u0027s right,\" Damon said. \"We vampirestake - a lesson you need to learn.\" \"Damon, we\u0027re supposed to take care of each other - we promised - \" \"Yes, and I\u0027m going to take care ofyou right now.\" And Damon bled him. It was even more painful than the lashings of Power, and Stefan held himself carefully still for it, refusing to put up a struggle. The razor-sharp teeth shouldn\u0027t have hurt as they plunged into his carotid, but Damon was holding him at an angle - now by his hair - deliberately so that they did. Then came the real pain. The agony of having blood drawn out against your will, against your resistance. That was a torture that humans compared with having their souls ripped out from their living bodies. They would do anything to avoid it. All Stefan knew was that it was one of the greatestphysical anguishes that he had ever had to endure, and that at last tears formed in his eyes and rolled down his temples and down into his wavy dark hair. Worse, for a vampire, was the humiliation of having another vampire treat you like a human, treat you likemeat . Stefan\u0027s heart was pounding in his ears as he writhed under the double carving knives of Damon\u0027s canines, trying to bear the mortification of being used this way. At least - thank God - Elena had listened to him and stayed in his room. He was beginning to wonder if Damon had truly gone insane and meant to kill him when - at last - with a shove that sent him off balance, Damon released him. Stefan tripped and fell, rolled, and looked up, only to find Damon standing over him again. He pressed his fingers to the torn flesh on his neck. \"And now,\" Damon said coldly, \"you will go up and get me my jacket.\" Stefan got up slowly. He knew Damon must be savoring this: Stefan\u0027s humiliation, Stefan\u0027s neat clothes wrinkled and covered with torn blades of grass and mud from Mrs. Flowers\u0027 scraggly flower bed. He did his best to brush them off with one hand, the other still pressed to his neck. \"You\u0027re quiet,\" Damon remarked, standing by his Ferrari, running his tongue over his lips and gums, his eyes narrow with pleasure. \"No snappy back talk? Not even a word? I think this is a lesson I should teach you more often.\" Stefan was having trouble making his legs move. Well, that went about as well as could be expected, he thought as he turned back toward the boardinghouse. Then he stopped. Elena was leaning out of the unshuttered window in his room, holding Damon\u0027s jacket. Her expression was very sober, suggesting she\u0027d seen everything. It was a shock for Stefan, but he suspected it was an even greater shock for Damon. And then Elena whirled the jacket around once and threw it so that it made a direct landing at Damon\u0027s feet, wrapping around them. To Stefan\u0027s astonishment, Damon went pale. He picked up the jacket as if he didn\u0027t really want to touch it. His eyes were on Elena the whole time. He got in his car. \"Good-bye, Damon. I can\u0027t say it\u0027s been a pleasure - \" Without a word, looking for all the world like a naughty child who\u0027d been whipped, Damon turned on the ignition. \"Just leave me alone,\" he said expressionlessly in a low voice. He drove off in a cloud of dust and gravel. Elena\u0027s eyes were not serene when Stefan shut the door to his room behind him. They were shining with a light that nearly stopped him in the doorway. Hehurtyou. \"He hurts everyone. He doesn\u0027t seem to be able to help it. But there was something weird about him today. I don\u0027t know what. Right now, I don\u0027t care. But look at you, making sentences!\" He\u0027s...Elena paused, and for the first time since she\u0027d first opened her eyes back in the glade where she had been resurrected, there was a frown-wrinkle on her forehead. She couldn\u0027t make a picture. She didn\u0027t know the right words.Something inside him. Growing inside him. Like...cold fire, dark light, she said finally.But hidden. Fire that burns from the inside out. Stefan tried to match this up with anything he\u0027d heard of and came up blank. He was still humiliated that Elena had seen what had happened. \"AllI know that\u0027s inside him is my blood. Along with that of half the girls in town.\" Elena shut her eyes and shook her head slowly. Then, as if deciding not to go any further down that path, she patted the bed beside her. Come,she ordered confidently, looking up. The gold in her eyes seemed especially lustrous.Let me...unhurt...the pain. When Stefan didn\u0027t come immediately, she held out her arms. Stefan knew he shouldn\u0027t go to them, but hewas hurt - especially in his pride. He went to her and bent down to kiss her hair.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-return-nightfall-the-vampire-diaries-5/page-3.html","bookId":2035,"book":{"id":2035,"title":"The Return: Nightfall (The Vampire Diaries #5)","description":"Storyline: One week after Elena Gilbert has come back from the dead, she is in a childlike state, unable to read and almost completely unable to speak.
