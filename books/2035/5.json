{"id":108789,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"With the signed contract safely tucked in Bonnie\u0027s purse, they pulled up to the boardinghouse in which Stefan had taken up residence again. They looked for Mrs. Flowers but couldn\u0027t find her, as usual. So they walked up the narrowing steps with the worn carpet and splintering balustrade, hallooing as they came. \"Stefan! Elena! It\u0027s us!\" The door at the very top opened and Stefan\u0027s head came out. He looked - different somehow. \"Happier,\" Bonnie whispered wisely to Meredith. \"Is he?\" \"Of course.\"Bonnie was shocked. \"He\u0027s got Elena back.\" \"Yes, he does. Just the way she was when they met, I bet. You saw her in the woods.\" Meredith\u0027s voice was heavy with significance. \"But...that\u0027s...oh, no! She\u0027shuman again!\" Matt looked down the stairs and hissed, \"Will you two quit it? They\u0027re gonna hear us.\" Bonnie was confused. Of course Stefan could hear them, but if you were going to worry about what Stefan heard you\u0027d have to worry about what youthought , too - Stefan could always catch the shape of what you were thinking, if not the actual words. \"Boys!\" hissed Bonnie. \"I mean I know they\u0027re totally necessary and all, but sometimes they Just Don\u0027t Get It.\" \"Just wait till you try men,\" whispered Meredith, and Bonnie thought of Alaric Saltzman, the college student that Meredith was more or less engaged to. \"I could tell you a thing or two,\" Caroline added, examining her long, manicured nails with a world-weary look. \"But Bonnie doesn\u0027t need to know even one yet. She has plenty of time to learn,\" Meredith said, firmly in mothering mode. \"Let\u0027s go inside.\" \"Sit down, sit down,\" Stefan was encouraging them as they entered, the perfect host. But nobody could sit down. All eyes were fixed on Elena. She was sitting in lotus position in front of the room\u0027s only open window, with the fresh wind making her white nightgown billow. Her hair was true gold again, not the perilous white-gold it had become when Stefan had unintentionally turned into a vampire. She looked exactly the way Bonnie remembered her. Except that she was floating three feet off the floor. Stefan saw them all gawking. \"It\u0027s just something she does,\" he said almost apologetically. \"She woke up the day after our fight with Klaus and started floating. I think gravity hasn\u0027t quite got a hold on her yet.\" He turned back to Elena. \"Look who\u0027s come to see you,\" he said enticingly. Elena was looking. Her gold-flecked blue eyes were curious, and she was smiling, but there was no recognition as she looked from one visitor to another. Bonnie had been holding her arms out. \"Elena?\" she said. \"It\u0027sme , Bonnie, remember? I was there when you came back.I\u0027m sure glad to see you .\" Stefan tried again. \"Elena, remember? These are your friends, your good friends. This tall, dark-haired beauty is Meredith, and this fiery little pixie is Bonnie, and this guy with the all-American looks is Matt.\" Something flickered in Elena\u0027s face, and Stefan repeated, \"Matt.\" \"And what about me? Or am I invisible?\" Caroline said from the doorway. She sounded good-humored enough, but Bonnie knew that it made Caroline grind her teeth just to see Stefan and Elena together and out of danger. \"You\u0027re right. I\u0027m sorry,\" Stefan said, and he did something that no ordinary eighteen-year-old could have pulled off without looking like an idiot. He took Caroline\u0027s hand and kissed it as gracefully and unthinkingly as if he were some count from nearly half a millennium ago. Which, of course, was pretty much what he was, Bonnie thought. Caroline looked slightly smug - Stefan had taken his time with the hand kiss. Now he said, \"And last but not least, this tanned beauty here is Caroline.\" Then, very gently, in a voice that Bonnie had heard him use only a few times since she\u0027d known him, he said, \"Don\u0027t you remember them, love? They nearly died for you - and for me.\" Elena was floating easily, in a standing position now, bobbing like a swimmer trying to keep still. \"We did it because we care,\" Bonnie said, and she put her arms out again for a hug. \"But we never expected to get you back, Elena.\" Her eyes filled. \"You came back to us. Don\u0027t youknow us?\" Elena floated down until she was directly in front of Bonnie. There was still no sign of recognition on her face, but there was something else. There was a kind of limitless benediction and tranquility. Elena radiated a calming peace and an unconditional love that made Bonnie breathe in deeply and shut her eyes. She could feel it like sunshine on her face, like the ocean in her ears. After a moment Bonnie realized she was in danger of crying at the sheer feeling ofgoodness - a word that was almost never used these days. Some things still could be simply, untouchablygood . Elenawas good. And then, with a gentle touch on Bonnie\u0027s shoulder, Elena floated toward Caroline. She held out her arms. Caroline looked flustered. A wave of scarlet swept up her neck. Bonnie saw it, but didn\u0027t understand it. They\u0027d all had a chance to pick up on Elena\u0027s vibes. And Caroline and Elenahad been close friends - until Stefan, their rivalry had been friendly. It wasgood of Elena to pick Caroline to hug first. And then Elena went into the circle of Caroline\u0027s hastily raised arms and just as Caroline began to say \"I\u0027ve - \" she kissed her full on the mouth. It wasn\u0027t just a peck, either. Elena wrapped her arms around Caroline\u0027s neck and hung on. For long moments Caroline stood deathly still as if in shock. Then she reared back and struggled, at first feebly, and then so violently that Elena was catapulted backward in the air, her eyes wide. Stefan caught her like an infielder going for a pop fly. \"What thehell - ?\" Caroline was scrubbing at her mouth. \"Caroline!\" Stefan\u0027s voice was filled with fierce protectiveness. \"It doesn\u0027t mean anything like what you\u0027re thinking. It\u0027s got nothing to do with sex at all. She\u0027s just identifying you, learning who you are. She can do that now that she\u0027s come back to us.\" \"Prairie dogs,\" Meredith said in the cool, slightly distant voice she often used to bring down the temperature of a room. \"Prairie dogs kiss when they meet. It does exactly what you said, Stefan, helps them identify specific individuals....\" Caroline was far beyond Meredith\u0027s abilities to cool down, however. Scrubbing her mouth had been a bad idea; she had smeared scarlet lipstick all around it, so that she looked like something out of aBride of Dracula movie. \"Are you crazy? What do you think I am? Because some hamsters do it, that makes it okay?\" She had flushed a mottled red, from her throat to the roots of her hair. \"Prairie dogs. Not hamsters.\" \"Oh, who gives a - \" Caroline broke off, frantically fumbling in her purse until Stefan offered her a box of tissues. He had already dabbed the scarlet smears off Elena\u0027s mouth. Caroline rushed into the small bathroom attached to Stefan\u0027s attic bedroom and slammed the door hard. Bonnie and Meredith caught each other\u0027s eye and let out their breaths simultaneously, convulsing with laughter. Bonnie did a lightning-quick imitation of Caroline\u0027s expression and frantic scrubbing, miming someone using handful after handful of tissues. Meredith gave a reproving shake of her head, but she and Stefan and Matt all had a case of themustn\u0027t-laugh snickers. A lot of it was simply the release of tension - they had seen Elena alive again, after six long months without her - but they couldn\u0027t stop laughing. Or at least they couldn\u0027t until a tissue box sailed out of the bathroom, nearly hitting Bonnie in the head - and they all realized that the slammed door had rebounded - and that there was a mirror in the bathroom. Bonnie caught Caroline\u0027s expression in the mirror and then met her full-on glare. Yep, she\u0027d seen them laughing at her. The door closed again - this time, as if it had been kicked. Bonnie ducked her head and clutched at her short strawberry curls, wishing the floor would open up and swallow her. \"I\u0027ll apologize,\" she said after a gulp, trying to be adult about the situation. Then she looked up and realized that everyone else was more concerned about Elena, who was clearly upset by this rejection. It\u0027s a good thing we made Caroline sign that oath in blood, Bonnie thought. And it\u0027s a good thing that you-know-who signed it, too. If there was one thing Damon would know about, it was consequences. Even as she was thinking this, she joined the huddle around Elena. Stefan was trying to hold Elena; Elena was trying to go after Caroline; and Matt and Meredith were helping Stefan and telling Elena that it was okay. When Bonnie joined them, Elena gave up trying to get to the bathroom. Her face was distressed, her blue eyes swimming with tears. Elena\u0027s serenity had been broken by hurt and regret - and underneath that, a surprisingly deep apprehension. Bonnie\u0027s intuition gave a twinge. But she patted Elena\u0027s elbow, the only part of her that she could reach, and added her voice to the chorus: \"You didn\u0027t know she\u0027d get so upset. You didn\u0027t hurt her.\" Crystal tears spilled down Elena\u0027s cheeks, and Stefan caught them with a tissue as if each one was priceless. \"She thinks that Carolineis hurt,\" Stefan said, \"and she\u0027s worried about her - for some reason I don\u0027t get.\" Bonnie realized that Elena could communicate after all - by mind-link. \"I felt that, too,\" she said. \"The hurt. But tell her - I mean - Elena, Ipromise I\u0027ll apologize. I\u0027ll grovel.\" \"It may take some groveling from all of us,\" Meredith said. \"But meanwhile I want to make sure that this \u0026iexcl;\u0026reg;angel unaware\u0027 recognizesme .\" With an expression of tranquil sophistication, she took Elena out of Stefan\u0027s arms and into her own, and then she kissed her. Unfortunately, this coincided with Caroline stalking out of the bathroom. The bottom of her face was paler than the top, having been denuded of all makeup: lipstick, bronzer, blush, the works. She stopped dead and stared. \"I don\u0027t believe it,\" she said in scathing tones. \"You\u0027restill doing it! It\u0027s dis - \" \"Caroline.\" Stefan\u0027s voice was a warning. \"I came here to see Elena.\" Caroline - beautiful, lithe, bronze-limbed Caroline - was twisting her hands together as if in terrible conflict. \"Theold Elena. And what do I see? She\u0027s like a baby - she can\u0027t talk. She\u0027s like some smirking guru floating in the air. And now she\u0027s like some kind of perverted - \" \"Don\u0027t finish that,\" Stefan said quietly but firmly. \"I told you, she ought to be over the first symptoms in just a few days, to judge by her progress so far,\" he added. And hewas different, somehow, Bonnie thought. Not just happier to have gotten Elena back. He was...stronger somehow at the core of himself. Stefan had always been quiet inside; her powers sensed him as a pool of clear water. Now she saw that same clear water built up like a tsunami. What could have changed Stefan so much? The answer came to her immediately, although in the form of a wondering question. Elena was still part spirit - Bonnie\u0027s intuition told her that. What did it do if you drank the blood of someone who was in that state? \"Caroline, let\u0027s just drop it,\" she said. \"I\u0027m sorry, I\u0027m really, really sorry for - you know. I was wrong, and I\u0027m sorry.\" \"Oh, you\u0027resorry . Oh, that makes everything all right then, doesn\u0027t it?\" Caroline\u0027s voice was pure acid, and she turned her back on Bonnie with finality. Bonnie was surprised to feel the sting of tears behind her eyes. Elena and Meredith still had their arms around each other, their cheeks wet with the other\u0027s tears. They were looking at each other and Elena was beaming. \"Now she\u0027ll know you anywhere,\" Stefan told Meredith. \"Not just your face, but - well, the inside of you, too, or the shape of it, at least. I should have mentioned that before this started, but I\u0027m the only one she\u0027s \u0026iexcl;\u0026reg;met,\u0027 and I didn\u0027t realize - \" \"You should have realized!\" Caroline was pacing like a tiger. \"So you kissed a girl, sowhat ?\" Bonnie exploded. \"What do you think, you\u0027re going to grow a beard now?\" As if powered by the conflict around her, Elena suddenly took off. All at once she was zipping around the room as if she\u0027d been shot from a cannon; her hair crackled with electricity when she made sudden stops or turns. She soared around the room twice, and as she was silhouetted against the dusty old window, Bonnie thought,Oh, my God! We\u0027ve got to get her some clothes! She looked at Meredith and saw that Meredith had shared her realization. Yes, they had to get Elena clothes - and most especially underclothes. As Bonnie moved toward Elena, as shyly as if she\u0027d never been kissed before, Caroline exploded. \"You just keep doing it and doing it and doing it!\" She was practically screeching by now, Bonnie thought. \"What\u0027swrong with you? Don\u0027t you have any morals at all?\" This, unfortunately, caused another case of thedon\u0027t-laugh-don\u0027t-laugh choked giggles in Bonnie and Meredith. Even Stefan turned away sharply, his gallantry toward a guest clearly fighting a losing battle. Not just a guest, Bonnie thought, but a girl he\u0027d gonepret-ty darn far with, as Caroline hadn\u0027t been shy about letting people know when she\u0027d gotten her hands on him. About as far as vampirescould go, Bonnie remembered, which was not the whole way. Something about the blood-sharing substituting for - well, for Doing It. But he wasn\u0027t the only one Caroline had bragged about. Caroline was infamous. Bonnie glanced at Elena, saw that Elena was watching Caroline with a strange expression. Not as if Elena were afraid of her, but rather as if Elena were deeply worriedabout her. \"Are you all right?\" Bonnie whispered. To her surprise, Elena nodded, then looked at Caroline and shook her head. She carefully looked Caroline up and down and her expression was that of a puzzled doctor examining a very sick patient. Then she floated toward Caroline, one hand extended. Caroline shied away, as if she were disgusted to have Elena touch her. No, not disgusted, Bonnie thought, butfrightened. \"How do I know what she\u0027ll do next?\" Caroline snapped, but Bonnie knew that wasn\u0027t the real reason for her fear. What do we have going on here? she wondered. Elena afraidfor Caroline, and Caroline afraidof Elena. What does that equal? Bonnie\u0027s psychic senses were giving her gooseflesh. There was somethingwrong with Caroline, she felt, something she\u0027d never encountered before. And the air...it was thickening somehow, as if it were building up to a thunderstorm. Caroline made a sharp turn to keep her face averted from Elena\u0027s. She moved behind a chair. \"Just keep her freakin\u0027away from me, all right? I won\u0027t let her touch me again - \" she began, when Meredith changed the whole situation with two quiet words. \"Whatdid you say to me?\" Caroline said, staring.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-return-nightfall-the-vampire-diaries-5/page-5.html","bookId":2035,"book":{"id":2035,"title":"The Return: Nightfall (The Vampire Diaries #5)","description":"Storyline: One week after Elena Gilbert has come back from the dead, she is in a childlike state, unable to read and almost completely unable to speak.
