{"id":108806,"no":24,"title":"Page 24","content":"Bonnie was disturbed and confused. It was dark. \"All right,\" a voice that was brusque and calming at once was saying. \"That\u0027s two possible concussions, one puncture wound in need of a tetanus shot - and - well, I\u0027m afraid I\u0027ve got to sedate your girl, Jim. And I\u0027m going to need help, but you\u0027re not allowed to move at all. You just lie back and keep your eyes shut.\" Bonnie opened her own eyes. She had a vague memory of falling forward onto her bed. But she wasn\u0027t at home; she was still at the Saitou house, lying on a couch. As always, when in confusion or fear, she looked for Meredith. Meredith was just returning from the kitchen with a makeshift ice pack. She put it on Bonnie\u0027s already wet forehead. \"I just fainted,\" Bonnie explained, as she herself figured it out. \"That\u0027s all.\" \"I know you fainted. You cracked your head pretty hard on the floor,\" Meredith replied, and for once her face was perfectly readable: worry and sympathy and relief were all visible. She actually had tears pooling in her eyes. \"Oh, Bonnie, I couldn\u0027t get to you in time. Isobel was in the way, and those tatami mats don\u0027t cushion the floor much - and you\u0027ve been out for almost half an hour! Youscared me.\" \"I\u0027m sorry.\" Bonnie fumbled a hand out a blanket she seemed to be wrapped in and gave Meredith\u0027s hand a squeeze. It meantvelociraptor sisterhood is still in action . It also meantthank you for caring . Jim was sprawled on another couch holding an ice pack to the back of his head. His face was greenish-white. He tried to stand up but Dr. Alpert - it was her voice that was both crusty and kind - pushed him back onto the couch. \"You don\u0027t need any more exertion,\" she said. \"But I do need an assistant. Meredith, can you help me with Isobel? It sounds as if she\u0027s going to be quite a handful.\" \"She hit me in the back of the head with a lamp,\" Jim warned them. \"Don\u0027t ever turn your back on her.\" \"We\u0027ll be careful,\" Dr. Alpert said. \"You two stayhere ,\" Meredith added firmly. Bonnie was watching Meredith\u0027s eyes. She wanted to get up to help them with Isobel. But Meredith had that special look of determination that meant it was better not to argue. As soon as they left, Bonnie tried to stand up. But immediately she began to see the pulsating gray nothingness that meant she was going to pass out again. She lay back down, teeth gritted. For a long time there were crashes and shouts from Isobel\u0027s room. Bonnie would hear Dr. Alpert\u0027s voice raised, and then Isobel\u0027s, and then a third voice - not Meredith, who never shouted if she could help it, but what sounded like Isobel\u0027s voice, only slowed down and distorted. Then, finally, there was silence, and Meredith and Dr. Alpert came back carrying a limp Isobel between them. Meredith had a bloody nose and Dr. Alpert\u0027s short pepper-and-salt hair was standing on end, but they had somehow gotten a T-shirt onto Isobel\u0027s abused body and Dr. Alpert had managed to hang on to her black bag as well. \"Walking wounded, stay where you are. We\u0027ll be back to lend you a hand,\" the doctor said in her terse way. Next Dr. Albert and Meredith made another trip to take Isobel\u0027s grandmother with them. \"I don\u0027t like her color,\" Dr. Albert said briefly. \"Or the tick of her tocker. We might as well all go get checked up.\" A minute later they returned to help Jim and Bonnie to Dr. Albert\u0027s SUV. The sky had clouded over, and the sun was a red ball not far from the horizon. \"Do you want me to give you something for the pain?\" the doctor asked, seeing Bonnie eyeing the black bag. Isobel was in the very back of the SUV, where the seats had been folded down. Meredith and Jim were in the two seats in front of her, with Grandma Saitou between them, and Bonnie - at Meredith\u0027s insistence - was in the front with the doctor. \"Um, no, it\u0027s okay,\" Bonnie said. Actually, she had been wondering whether the hospital actually could cure Isobel of infection any better than Mrs. Flowers\u0027 herbal compresses could. But although her head throbbed and ached and she was developing a lump the size of a hard-boiled egg on her forehead, she didn\u0027t want to cloud her thinking. There was something nagging at her, some dream or something she\u0027d had while Meredith said she\u0027d been unconscious. Whatwas it? \"All right then. Seat belts on? Here we go.\" The SUV pulled away from the Saitou house. \"Jim, you said Isobel has a three-year-old sister asleep upstairs, so I called my granddaughter Jayneela to come over here. At least it will be somebody in the house.\" Bonnie twisted around to look at Meredith. They both spoke at once. \"Oh, no! She can\u0027t go in!Especially not into Isobel\u0027s room! Look, please, you have to - \" Bonnie babbled. \"I\u0027m really not sure if that\u0027s a good idea, Dr. Alpert,\" Meredith said, no less urgently but much more coherently. \"Unless she does stay away from that room and maybe has someone with her - a boy would be good.\" \"A boy?\" Dr. Alpert seemed bewildered, but the combination of Bonnie\u0027s distress and Meredith\u0027s sincerity seemed to convince her. \"Well, Tyrone, my grandson, was watching TV when I left. I\u0027ll try to get him.\" \"Wow!\" Bonnie said involuntarily. \"That\u0027s the Tyrone who\u0027s offensive tackle on the football team next year, huh? I heard that they call him the Tyre-minator.\" \"Well, let\u0027s say I think he\u0027ll be able to protect Jayneela,\" Dr. Alpert said after making the call. \"But we\u0027re the ones with the, ah,overexcited girl in the vehicle with us. From the way she fought the sedative, I\u0027d say she\u0027s quite a \u0026iexcl;\u0026reg;terminator\u0027 herself.\" Meredith\u0027s mobile phone beeped out the tune it used for numbers not in its memory, and then announced, \"Mrs. T. Flowers is calling you. Will you take the - \" In a moment Meredith had hit thetalk button. \"Mrs. Flowers?\" she said. The hum of the SUV kept anything Mrs. Flowers might be saying from Bonnie and the others, so Bonnie went back to concentrating on two things: what she knew about the \"victims\" of the Salem \"witches,\" and what that elusive thought while she was unconscious had been. All of which promptly flew away when Meredith put down her mobile phone. \"What was it? What?What? \" Bonnie couldn\u0027t get a clear view of Meredith\u0027s face in the dusk, but it looked pale, and when she spoke shesounded pale, too. \"Mrs. Flowers was doing some gardening and she was about to go inside when she noticed that there was something in her begonia bushes. She said it looked as if someone had tried to stuff something down between the bush and a wall, but a bit of fabric stuck up.\" Bonnie felt as if the wind had been knocked out of her.\"What was it?\" \"It was a duffel bag, full of shoes and clothes. Boots. Shirts. Pants. All Stefan\u0027s.\" Bonnie gave a shriek that caused Dr. Alpert to swerve and then recover, the SUV fishtailing. \"Oh, my God; oh, my God - he didn\u0027t go!\" \"Oh, I think he went all right. Just not of his own free will,\" Meredith said grimly. \"Damon,\" Bonnie gasped, and slumped back into her own seat, tears welling up in her eyes and overflowing. \"I couldn\u0027t help wanting to believe...\" \"Head getting worse?\" Dr. Alpert asked, tactfully ignoring the conversation that had not included her. \"No - well, yes, it is,\" Bonnie admitted. \"Here, open the bag and give me a look inside. I\u0027ve got samples of this and that...all right, here you go. Anybody see a water bottle back there?\" Jim listlessly handed one over. \"Thanks,\" Bonnie said, taking the small pill and a deep gulp. She had to get her head right. If Damon had kidnapped Stefan, then she should be Calling for him, shouldn\u0027t she? God only knew where he would end up this time. Why hadn\u0027t any of them even thought of it as a possibility? Well, first, because the new Stefan was supposed to be so strong, and second, because of the note in Elena\u0027s diary. \"That\u0027s it!\" she said, startling even herself. It had all come flooding back, everything that she and Matt had shared.... \"Meredith!\" she said, oblivious to the side look which Dr. Alpert gave her, \"while I was unconscious I talked withMatt . He was unconscious, too - \" \"Was he hurt?\" \"God, yes. Damon must have been doing something awful. But he said to ignore it, that something had been bothering him about the note Stefan left for Elena ever since he saw it. Something about Stefan talking to the English teacher about how to spelljudgment last year. And he just kept saying,Look for the backup file. Look for the backup...before Damon does .\" She stared at Meredith\u0027s dim face, aware as they cruised slowly to stop at an intersection that Dr. Alpert and Jim were both staring at her. Tact had its limits. Meredith\u0027s voice broke the silence. \"Doctor,\" she said, \"I\u0027m going to have to ask you something. If you take a left here and another one at Laurel Street and then just drive for about five minutes to Old Wood, it won\u0027t be too far out of your way. But it\u0027ll let me get to the boardinghouse where the computer Bonnie\u0027s talking about is. You may think I\u0027m crazy, but Ineed to get to that computer.\" \"I know you\u0027re not crazy; I\u0027d have noticed it by now.\" The doctor laughed mirthlessly. \"And I have heard some things about young Bonnie here...nothing bad, I promise, but a little difficult to believe. After seeing what I saw today, I think I\u0027m beginning to change my opinion about them.\" The doctor abruptly took a left turn, muttering, \"Somebody\u0027s taken the stop sign from this road, too.\" Then she continued, to Meredith, \"I can do what you ask. I\u0027d drive you all the way to the old boardinghouse - \" \"No! That would be much too dangerous!\" \" - but I\u0027ve got to get Isobel to a hospital as soon as possible. Not to mention Jim. I think he really does have a concussion. And Bonnie - \" \"Bonnie,\" Bonnie said, enunciating distinctly, \"is going to the boardinghouse, too.\" \"No, Bonnie! I\u0027m going torun , Bonnie, do you understand that? I\u0027m going torun as fast as I can - and I can\u0027t let you hold me up.\" Meredith\u0027s voice was grim. \"I won\u0027t hold you up, I swear it. You go ahead and run. I\u0027ll run, too. My head feels fine, now. If you have to leave me behind, youkeep on running. I\u0027ll be coming after you.\" Meredith opened her mouth and then closed it again. There must have been something in Bonnie\u0027s face that told her any kind of argument would be useless, Bonnie thought. Because that was the truth of the matter. \"Here we are,\" Dr. Alpert said a few minutes later. \"Corner of Laurel and Old Wood.\" She pulled a small flashlight out of her black bag and shone it in each of Bonnie\u0027s eyes, one after another. \"Well, it still doesn\u0027t look as if you have concussion. But you know, Bonnie, that my medical opinion is that you shouldn\u0027t be running anywhere. I just can\u0027t force you to accept to take treatment if you don\u0027t want it. But I can make you take this.\" She handed Bonnie the small flashlight. \"Good luck.\" \"Thank you for everything,\" Bonnie said, for an instant laying her pale hand on Dr. Alpert\u0027s long-fingered, dark brown one. \"You be careful, too - of fallen trees and of Isobel, and of something red in the road.\" \"Bonnie, I\u0027m leaving.\" Meredith was already outside the SUV. \"And lock your doors! And don\u0027t get out until you\u0027re away from the woods!\" Bonnie said, as she tumbled down from the vehicle beside Meredith. And then they ran. Of course, all that Bonnie had said about Meredith running in front of her, leaving her behind, was nonsense, and they both knew it. Meredith seized Bonnie\u0027s hand as soon as Bonnie\u0027s feet had touched the road and began running like a greyhound, dragging Bonnie along with her, at times seeming to whirl her over dips in the road. Bonnie didn\u0027t need to be told how important speed was. She wished desperately that they had a car. She wished a lot of things, primarily that Mrs. Flowers lived in the middle of town and not way out here on the wild side. At last, as Meredith had foreseen, she was winded, and her hand so slick with sweat that it slipped out of Meredith\u0027s hand. She bent almost double, hands on her knees, trying to get her breath. \"Bonnie! Wipe your hand! We have to run!\" \"Just - give me - a minute - \" \"We don\u0027t have a minute! Can\u0027t youhear it?Come on! \" \"I justneed - to get - my breath.\" \"Bonnie, look behind you. And don\u0027t scream!\" Bonnie looked behind her, screamed, and then discovered that she wasn\u0027t winded after all. She took off, grabbing Meredith\u0027s hand. She could hear it, now, even above her own wheezing breath and the pounding in her ears. It was an insect sound, not a buzzing but still a sound that her brain filed underbug . It sounded like the whipwhipwhip of a helicopter, only much higher in pitch, as if a helicopter could have insect-like tentacles instead of blades. With that one glance, she had made out an entire gray mass of those tentacles, with heads in front - and all the heads were open to show mouths full of white sharp teeth. She struggled to turn on the flashlight. Night was falling, and she had no idea how long it would be until moonrise. All she knew was that the trees seemed to make everything darker, and thatthey were after her and Meredith. The malach. The whipping sound of tentacles beating the air was much louder now. Much closer. Bonnie didn\u0027t want to turn around and see the source of it. The sound was pushing her body beyond all sane limits. She couldn\u0027t help hearing over and over Matt\u0027s words:like putting my hand in a garbage disposal and turning it on. Like putting my hand in a garbage disposal... Her hand and Meredith\u0027s were covered with sweat again. And the gray mass was definitely overtaking them. It was only half as far away as it had been at first, and the whipping noise was getting higher-pitched. At the same time her legs felt like rubber. Literally. She couldn\u0027t feel her knees. And now they felt like rubber dissolving into gelatin. Vipvipvipvipveeee... It was the sound of one of them, closer than the rest. Closer, closer, and then it was in front of them, its mouth open in an oval shape with teeth all around the perimeter. Just like Matt had said. Bonnie had no breath to scream with. But she needed to scream. The headless thing with no eyes or features - just that horrible mouth - had turned ahead of them and was coming right for her. And her automatic response - to beat at it with her hands - could cost her an arm. Oh God, it was coming for her face.... \"There\u0027s the boardinghouse,\" gasped Meredith, giving her a jerk that lifted her off her feet.\"Run!\" Bonnie ducked, just as the malach tried to collide with her. Instantly, she felt tentacleswhipwhipwhip into her curly hair. She was abruptly yanked backward to a painful stumble and Meredith\u0027s hand was torn out of hers. Her legs wanted to collapse. Her guts wanted her to scream. \"Oh, God, Meredith, it\u0027s got me! Run!Don\u0027t let one get you!\" In front of her, the boardinghouse was lit up like a hotel. Usually it was dark except for maybe Stefan\u0027s window and one other. But now it shone like a jewel, just beyond her reach. \"Bonnie, shut your eyes!\" Meredith hadn\u0027t left her. She was still here. Bonnie could feel vine-like tentacles gently brushing her ear, lightly tasting her sweaty forehead, working toward her face, her throat...She sobbed. And then there was a sharp, loud crack mixed with a sound like a ripe melon bursting, and something damp scattered all over her back. She opened her eyes. Meredith was dropping a thick branch she had been holding like a baseball bat. The tentacles were already sliding out of Bonnie\u0027s hair. Bonnie didn\u0027t want to look at the mess behind her. \"Meredith, you - \" \"Come on - run!\" And she was running again. All the way up the gravel boardinghouse driveway, all the way up the path to the door. And there, in the doorway, Mrs. Flowers was standing with an old-fashioned kerosene lamp. \"Get in, get in,\" she said, and as Meredith and Bonnie skittered to a stop, sobbing for air, she slammed the door shut behind them. They all heard the sound that came next. It was like the sound the branch had made - a sharp crack plus a bursting, only much louder, and repeated many times over, like popcorn popping. Bonnie was shaking as she took her hands away from her ears and slid down to sit on the entry-hall rug. \"What in heaven\u0027s name have you girls been doing to yourselves?\" Mrs. Flowers said, eyeing Bonnie\u0027s forehead, Meredith\u0027s swollen nose, and their general state of sweaty exhaustion. \"It takes too - long to explain,\" Meredith got out. \"Bonnie! You can sit down - upstairs.\" Somehow or other Bonnie made it upstairs. Meredith went at once to the computer and turned it on, collapsing on the desk chair in front of it. Bonnie used the last of her energy to pull off her top. The back was stained with nameless insect juices. She crumpled it into a ball and threw it into a corner. Then she fell down on Stefan\u0027s bed. \"What exactly did Matt say?\" Meredith was getting her breath back. \"He saidLook in the backup - orLook for the backup file or something. Meredith, my head...it isn\u0027t good.\" \"Okay. Just relax. You did great out there.\" \"I made it because you saved me. Thanks...again....\" \"Don\u0027t worry about it. But I don\u0027t understand,\" Meredith added in her talking-to-herself murmur. \"There\u0027s a backup file of this note in the same directory, but it\u0027s no different. I don\u0027t see what Matt meant.\" \"Maybe he was confused,\" Bonnie said reluctantly. \"Maybe he was just in a lot of pain and sort of off his head.\" \"Backup file, backup file...wait a minute! Doesn\u0027t Word automatically save a backup in some weird place, like under the administrator directory or somewhere?\" Meredith was clicking rapidly through directories. Then she said, in a disappointed voice, \"No, nothing there.\" She sat back, letting her breath out sharply. Bonnie knew what she must be thinking. Their long and desperate run through danger couldn\u0027t all be for nothing. Itcouldn\u0027t . Then, slowly, Meredith said, \"There are a lot of temp files in here for one little note.\" \"What\u0027s a temp file?\" \"It\u0027s just a temporary storage of your file while you\u0027re working on it. Usually it just looks like gibberish, though.\" The clicking started again. \"But I must as well be thorough - oh!\" She interrupted herself. The clicking stopped. And then there was dead silence. \"What is it?\" Bonnie said anxiously. More silence. \"Meredith! Talk to me!Did you find a backup file? \" Meredith said nothing. She seemed not even to hear. She was reading with what looked like horrified fascination.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-return-nightfall-the-vampire-diaries-5/page-24.html","bookId":2035,"book":{"id":2035,"title":"The Return: Nightfall (The Vampire Diaries #5)","description":"Storyline: One week after Elena Gilbert has come back from the dead, she is in a childlike state, unable to read and almost completely unable to speak.
