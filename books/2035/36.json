{"id":108818,"no":36,"title":"Page 36","content":"Aprison, with filthy rushes on the floor and bars between her and the sleeping Stefan. Between her andStefan! It was really him. Elena didn\u0027t know how she could know. Undoubtedly they could twist and change your perceptions here. But just now, perhaps because nobody had been expecting her to drop into a dungeon, no one was prepared with anything to make her doubt her senses. Itwas Stefan. He was thinner than before, and his cheekbones stuck out. He was beautiful. And his mind felt just right, just the right mixture of honor and love and darkness and light and hope and grim understanding of the world he lived in. \"Stefan! Oh,hold me! \" He woke and half sat up. \"At least leave me my sleep. And meanwhile go away and put on another face, bitch!\" \"Stefan! Language!\" She saw muscles in Stefan\u0027s shoulders freeze. \"What...did you...say?\" \"Stefan...it\u0027s really me.I don\u0027t blame you for cursing. I curse this whole place and the two who put you here....\" \"Three,\" he said wearily, and bent his head. \"You\u0027d know that if you were real. Go and let them teach you about my traitor brother and his friends who sneak up on people with kekkai crowns...\" Elena couldn\u0027t wait to debate about Damon now. \"Won\u0027t youlook at me, at least?\" She saw him turn slowly, look slowly, then saw him leap up from a pallet made of sickly-looking hay, and saw him stare at her as if she were an angel dropped down from the sky. Then he turned his back on her and put his hands over his ears. \"No bargains,\" he said flatly. \"Don\u0027t even mention them to me. Go away. You\u0027ve gotten better but you\u0027re still a dream.\" \"Stefan!\" \"I said, go away!\" Time was wasting. And this was too cruel, after what she had been through just to speak to him. \"You first saw me just outside the principal\u0027s office the day you brought your papers into school and influenced the secretary. You didn\u0027t need to look at me to know what I looked like. Once I told you that I felt like a murderer because I said, \u0026iexcl;\u0026reg;Daddy, look\u0027 and pointed to - something outside - just before the car accident that killed my parents. I\u0027ve never been able to remember what the something was. The first word I learned when I came back from the afterlife wasStefan . Once, you looked at me in the rearview mirror of the car and said that I was your soul....\" \"Can\u0027t you stop torturing me for one hour? Elena - the real Elena - would be too smart to risk her life by coming here.\" \"Where\u0027s \u0026iexcl;\u0026reg;here\u0027?\" Elena said sharply, frightened. \"I need to know if I\u0027m supposed to get you out.\" Slowly Stefan uncovered his ears. Even more slowly he turned around again. \"Elena?\" he said, like a dying boy who has seen a gentle ghost in his bed. \"You\u0027re not real. You can\u0027t be here.\" \"I don\u0027t think I am. Shinichi made a magic house and it takes you wherever you want if you name it and open the door with this key. I said, \u0026iexcl;\u0026reg;Somewhere I can hear and see and touch Stefan.\u0027 But\" - she looked down - \"you say Ican\u0027t be here. Maybe it\u0027s all an illusion anyway.\" \"Hush.\" Now Stefan was clenching the bars on his side of the cell. \"Is this where you\u0027ve been? Is this theShi no Shi ?\" He gave a little laugh - not a real one. \"Not exactly what either of us expected, is it? And yet, they didn\u0027t lie in anything they said, Elena. Elena! I said \u0026iexcl;\u0026reg;Elena.\u0027 Elena, you\u0027re really here!\" Elena couldn\u0027t bear to waste any time. She took the few steps through damp, crackly straw and scampering creatures to the bars that separated her from Stefan. Then she tilted up her face, clutching bars in either hand, and shut her eyes. I will touch him. I will, I will. I\u0027m real, he\u0027s real - I\u0027ll touch him! Stefan leaned down - to humor her, she thought - and then warm lips touched hers. She put her arms through the bars because they were both weak at the knees: Stefan in astonishment that she could touch him, and Elena in relief and sobbing joy. But - there was no time. \"Stefan, take my bloodnow - take it!\" She looked desperately for something to cut herself with. Stefan might need her strength, and no matter what Damon had taken from her, she would always have enough for Stefan. If it killed her, she would have enough. She was glad, now, that in the tomb, Damon had persuaded her to take his. \"Easy. Easy, little love. If you mean it, I can bite your wrist, but...\" \"Do itnow !\" Elena Gilbert, the princess of Fell\u0027s Church, ordered. She had even gotten the strength to pull herself off her knees. Stefan gave her half a guilty glance. \"NOW!\"Elena insisted. Stefan bit her wrist. It was an odd sensation. It hurt a little more than when he pierced the side of her neck as usual. But there were good veins down there, she knew; she trusted Stefan to find the largest so that this would take the least amount of time. Her urgency had become his. But when he tried to pull back, she clutched a handful of his wavy dark hair and said, \"More, Stefan. You need it - oh, I can tell, and we don\u0027t have time to argue.\" The voice of command. Meredith had told her once that she had it, that she could lead armies. Well, she might need to lead armies to get into this place to save him. I\u0027ll get an army somewhere, she thought fuzzily. The starving bloodfever that Stefan had been in - they obviously hadn\u0027t fed him since she had last seen him - was dying into the more normal blood-taking that she knew. His mind melted into hers.When you say you\u0027ll get an army, I believe you. But it\u0027s impossible. No one\u0027s ever come back. Well, you will. I\u0027m bringing you back. Elena, Elena... Drink,she said, feeling like an Italian mother.As much as you can without being sick. But how did - no, you told me how you got here. That was the truth? The truth. I always tell you the truth. But Stefan, how do I getyouout? Shinichi and Misao - you know them? Enough. They each have half a ring. Together it makes a key. Each half is shaped like a running fox. But who knows where they may have hidden the pieces? And as I said, just to get into this place, it takes an army.... I\u0027ll find the pieces of the fox ring. I\u0027ll put them together. I\u0027ll get an army. I\u0027ll get you out. Elena, I can\u0027t keep drinking. You\u0027ll collapse. I\u0027m good at not collapsing. Please go on. I can hardly believe it\u0027s you - \"No kissing! Take my blood!\" Ma\u0027am! But Elena, truly, I\u0027m full now. Overfull. And tomorrow? \"I\u0027ll still be overfull.\" Stefan pulled away, a thumb on the places where he had pierced veins. \"Truly, I can\u0027t , love.\" \"And the next day?\" \"I\u0027ll manage.\" \"You will - because I broughtthis . Hold me, Stefan,\" she said, several decibels softer. \"Hold me through the bars.\" He did, looking bewildered, and she hissed in his ear, \"Act like you love me. Stroke my hair. Say nice things.\" \"Elena, lovely little love...\" He was still close enough mentally to say telepathically: Actlike I love you? But while his hands were stroking and squeezing and tangling in her hair, Elena\u0027s own hands were busy. She was transferring from under her clothes to under his a flask full of Black Magic wine. \"But where did you get it?\" Stefan whispered, seeming thunderstruck. \"The magic house has everything. I\u0027ve been waiting for my chance to give it to you if you needed it.\" \"Elena - \" \"What?\" Stefan seemed to be struggling with something. At last, eyes on the ground, he whispered, \"It\u0027s no good. I can\u0027t risk you getting killed for the sake of an impossibility. Forget me.\" \"Put your face to the bars.\" He looked at her but didn\u0027t ask any questions, obeying. She slapped him across the face. It wasn\u0027t a very hard slap...although Elena\u0027s hand hurt from colliding with the iron on either side. \"Now,be ashamed !\" she said. And before he could say anything else,\"Listen!\" It was the baying of hounds - far away, but getting closer. \"It\u0027syou they\u0027re after,\" Stefan said, suddenly frantic. \"You have to go!\" She just looked at him steadily. \"I love you, Stefan.\" \"I love you, Elena. Forever.\" \"I - oh, I\u0027msorry .\" Shecouldn\u0027t go; that was the thing. Like Caroline talking and talking and never leaving Stefan\u0027s apartment, she could stand here and speak about it, but she couldn\u0027t do it. \"Elena! Youhave to. I don\u0027t want you to see what they do - \" \"I\u0027ll kill them!\" \"You\u0027re no killer. You\u0027re not a fighter, Elena - and you shouldn\u0027t see this. Please? Remember once you asked me if I\u0027d like to see how many times you could make me say \u0026iexcl;\u0026reg;please?\u0027 Well, each counts for a thousand now. Please? For me? Will you go?\" \"One more kiss...\" Her heart was beating like a frantic bird inside her. \"Please!\" Blind with tears, Elena turned around and grasped hold of the cell door. \"Anywhere outside the ceremony where no one will see me!\" she gasped and wrenched the door to the corridor open and stepped through. At least she\u0027d seen Stefan, but for how long that would last to keep her heart from shattering again - - oh, my God, I\u0027mfalling - - she didn\u0027t know. Elena realized that shewas outside the boardinghouse somewhere - at least some eighty feet high - and plummeting rapidly. Her first, panicked conclusion was that she was going to die, and then instinct kicked in and she reached out with arms and hands and kicked in with legs and feet and managed to arrest her fall after twenty agonizing feet. I\u0027ve lost my flying wings forever, haven\u0027t I? she thought, concentrating on a single spot between her shoulder blades. She knew just where they should be - and nothing happened. Then, carefully, she inched her way closer to the trunk, pausing only to move to a higher twig a caterpillar that was sharing the branch with her. And she managed to find a sort of place where she could sit by sidling and then pushing backward. It was far too high a branch for her personal taste. As it was, she found that she could look down and see the widow\u0027s walk quite clearly, and that the longer she looked at any particular thing the clearer her vision got. Vampire vision plus, she thought. It showed her that she was Changing. Or else - yes, somehow here the sky was getting lighter. What it showed her was a dark and empty boardinghouse, which was disturbing because of what Caroline\u0027s father had said about \"the meeting\" and what she had learned telepathically from Damon about Shinichi\u0027s plans for this Moonspire night. Could this be not the real boardinghouse at all, but another trap? \"We made it!\" Bonnie cried as they approached the house. She knew her voice was shrill, was over-shrill, but somehow the sight of that brightly lit boardinghouse, like a Christmas tree with a star on top, comforted her, even if she knew that it was all wrong. She felt she could cry in relief. \"Yes, we did,\" Dr. Alpert\u0027s deep voice said. \"All of us. Isobel\u0027s the one who needs the most treatment, the fastest. Theophilia, get your nostrums ready, and somebody else take Isobel and run her a bath.\" \"I\u0027ll do it,\" Bonnie quavered, after a brief hesitation. \"She\u0027s going to stay tranquilized like she is now, right? Right?\" \"I\u0027llgo with Isobel,\" Matt said. \"Bonnie, you go with Mrs. Flowers and help her. And before we go inside, I want to make one thing clear: nobody goes anywhere alone. We all travel in twos or threes.\" There was the ring of authority in his voice. \"Makes sense,\" Meredith said crisply and took up a place by the doctor. \"You\u0027d better be careful, Matt; Isobel is the most dangerous.\" That was when the high, thin voices began outside the house. It sounded like two or three little girls singing. \"Isa-chan, Isa-chan, Drank her tea and ate her gran.\" \"Tami? Tami Bryce?\" Meredith demanded, opening the door as the tune began again. She darted forward, then she grabbed the doctor by the hand, and dragged her along beside her as she darted forward again. And, yes, Bonnie saw, there were three little figures, one in pajamas and two in nightgowns, and they were Tami Bryce and Kristin Dunstan and Ava Zarinski. Ava was only about eleven, Bonnie thought, and she didn\u0027t live near either Tami or Kristin. The three of them all giggled shrilly. Then they started singing again and Matt went after Kristin. \"Help me!\" Bonnie cried. She was suddenly hanging on to a bucking, kicking bronco that lashed out in every direction. Isobel seemed to have gone crazy, and she went crazier every time that tune was repeated. \"I\u0027ve got her,\" Matt said, closing in on her with a bear hug, but even the two of them couldn\u0027t hold Isobel still. \"I\u0027m getting her another sedative,\" Dr. Alpert said, and Bonnie saw the glances between Matt and Meredith - glances of suspicion. \"No - no, let Mrs. Flowers make her something,\" Bonnie said desperately, but the hypodermic needle was already almost at Isobel\u0027s arm. \"You\u0027re not giving her anything,\" Meredith said flatly, dropping the charade, and with one chorus-girl kick, she sent the hypodermic flying. \"Meredith! What\u0027s wrong with you?\" the doctor cried, wringing her wrist. \"It\u0027s what\u0027s wrong withyou that\u0027s the matter. Who are you? Where are we? This can\u0027t be the real boardinghouse.\" \"Obaasan! Mrs. Flowers! Can\u0027t you help us?\" Bonnie gasped, still trying to hold on to Isobel. \"I\u0027ll try,\" Mrs. Flowers said determinedly, heading toward her. \"No, I meant with Dr. Alpert - and maybe Jim. Don\u0027t you - know any spells - to make people take on their true forms?\" \"Oh!\" Obaasan said. \"I can help with that. Just let me down, Jim dear. We\u0027ll have everyone in their true forms in no time.\" Jayneela was a sophomore with large, dreamy, dark eyes that were generally lost in a book. But now, as it neared midnight and Gramma still hadn\u0027t called, she shut her book and looked at Ty. Tyrone seemed big and fierce and mean on the playing field, but off it he was the nicest, kindest, gentlest big brother a girl could want. \"You think Gramma\u0027s okay?\" \"Hm?\" Tyrone had his nose in a book, too, but it was one of those help-you-get-into-the-college-of-your-dreams books. As a senior-to-be, he was having to make some serious decisions. \"Of course she is.\" \"Well, I\u0027m going to check on the little girl, at least.\" \"You know what, Jay?\" He poked her teasingly with one toe. \"You worry too much.\" In moments he was lost again in Chapter Six, \"How to Make the Most of Your Community Service.\" But then the screams started coming from above him. Long, loud, high screams - his sister\u0027s voice. He dropped the book and ran. \"Obaasan?\" Bonnie said. \"Just a moment, dear,\" Grandma Saitou said. Jim had put her down and now she was facing him squarely: she looking up, and he looking down. And there was something...very wrong about it. Bonnie felt a wave of pure terror. Could Jim have done something evil to Obaasan as he carried her? Of course he could. Why hadn\u0027t she thought of that? And there was the doctor with her syringe, ready to tranquilize anyone who got too \"hysterical.\" Bonnie looked at Meredith, but Meredith was trying to deal with two squirming little girls, and could only glance helplessly back. All right, then, Bonnie thought. I\u0027ll kick him where it hurts most and get the old lady away from him. She turned back to Obaasan and felt herself freeze. \"Just one thing I have to do...,\" Obaasan had said. And she was doing it. Jim was bent at the waist, folded in half toward Obaasan, who was on her tiptoes. They were locked in a deep, intimate kiss. Oh, God! They had met four people in a wood - and assumed that two were sane and two insane. How could they tell which were the insane ones? Well, if two of them see things that aren\u0027t there... But the housewas there; Bonnie could see it, too. Wasshe insane? \"Meredith, come on!\" she screamed. Her nerve breaking completely, she began to run away from the house toward the forest. Something from the skies plucked her up as easily as an owl picks up a mouse and held her in an unrelenting iron grip. \"Going somewhere?\" Damon\u0027s voice asked from above her as he glided in the last few yards to a stop, with her neatly tucked under one steely arm. \"Damon!\" Damon\u0027s eyes were slightly narrowed, as though at a joke only he could see. \"Yes, the evil one himself. Tell me something, my fiery little fury.\" Bonnie had already exhausted herself trying to make him let go. She hadn\u0027t even succeeded in tearing his clothes. \"What?\" she snapped. Possessed or not, Damon had last seen her when she had Called him to save her from Caroline\u0027s insanity. But according to Matt\u0027s reports, he had done something awful to Elena. \"Why do girls love to convert a sinner? Why can you feed them almost any line if they feel that they\u0027ve reformed you?\" Bonnie didn\u0027t know what he was talking about, but she could guess. \"What did you do with Elena?\" she said ferociously. \"Gave her what she wanted, that\u0027s all,\" Damon said, his black eyes twinkling. \"Is there anything so awful about that?\" Bonnie, frightened by that twinkle, didn\u0027t even try to run again. She knew it was no use. He was faster and stronger, and he could fly. Anyway, she had seen it in his face: a sort of distant remorselessness. They were not just Damon and Bonnie here together. They were natural predator and natural prey. And now here she was back with Jim and Obaasan - no, with a boy and girl she\u0027d never seen before. Bonnie was in time to watch the transformation. She saw Jim\u0027s body shrink and his hair turn black, but that wasn\u0027t the striking thing about it. The striking thing was that all around the edges, his hair was not black but crimson. It was as if flames were licking up from the tips into darkness. His eyes were golden and smiling. She saw Obaasan\u0027s doll-like old body grow younger and stronger and taller. This girl was a beauty; Bonnie had to admit it. She had gorgeous sloe-black eyes and silky hair that fell almost to her waist. And her hair was just like her brother\u0027s - only the red was even brighter, scarlet instead of crimson. She was wearing a barely-there laced black halter that showed how delicately built she was on top. And, of course, low-rise black leather pants to show the same thing on the bottom. She was wearing expensive-looking black high-heeled sandals, and her toenails were enameled the same brilliant red as the tips of her hair. At her belt, in a sinuous circle, was a curled-up whip with a scaly black handle. Dr. Alpert said slowly, \"My grandchildren...?\" \"They don\u0027t have anything to do with this,\" the boy with the strange hair said charmingly, smiling. \"As long as they mind their own business, you don\u0027t have to worry about them a bit.\" \"It\u0027s suicide or an attempted suicide - or something,\" Tyrone told the police dispatcher, almost weeping. \"I think it was a guy named Jim who went to my high school last year. No, this is nothing to do with any drugs - I came here to watch my little sister Jayneela. She was baby-sitting - look, just come over, will you? This guy\u0027s chewed off most of his fingers, and as I came in, he said, \u0026iexcl;\u0026reg;I\u0027ll always love you, Elena,\u0027 and he took a pencil and - no, I can\u0027t tell if he\u0027s alive or dead. But there\u0027s an old lady upstairs and I\u0027m sureshe\u0027s dead. Because she\u0027s not breathing.\" \"Who the hell are you?\" Matt was saying, eyeing the strange boy belligerently. \"I\u0027m the - \" \" - and what the hell are you doing here?\" \"I\u0027m the hell Shinichi,\" the boy said in a much louder voice, looking annoyed to be interrupted. When Matt just stared at him, he added in an annoyed voice, \"I\u0027m the kitsune - the were-fox, you could say - who\u0027s been messing with your town, idiot. I came halfway around the world to do it, and I\u0027d think you\u0027d at least have heard of me by now. And this is my lovely sister, Misao. We\u0027re twins.\" \"I don\u0027t care if you\u0027re triplets. Elena said somebody besides Damon was behind this. And so did Stefan before he - hey, what did you do to Stefan?What did you do to Elena? \" While the two strange males were bristling at each other - quite literally in Shinichi\u0027s case, since his hair was almost standing on end - Meredith was picking out Bonnie, Dr. Alpert, and Mrs. Flowers by eye. Then she glanced at Matt and touched herself lightly on the chest. She was the only one strong enough to womanhandle him, although Dr. Alpert gave a quick nod that said she would be helping. And then, while the boys were working up to shouting volume, Misao was giggling at the ground, and Damon was leaning against a door with his eyes shut, they moved. With no signal at all to unite them, they were running, instinctively, as one group. Meredith and Dr. Alpert grabbed Matt from either side and simply lifted him off his feet, just as Isobel quite unexpectedly jumped on Shinichi with a guttural scream. They hadn\u0027t expected anything from her, but it was certainly convenient, Bonnie thought as she hurtled over obstacles without even seeing them. Matt was still shouting and trying to run the other way and take out some primitive frustration on Shinichi, but he couldn\u0027t quite manage to get free to do it. Bonnie could scarcely believe it when they made it into the Wood again. Even Mrs. Flowers had kept up and most of them still had their flashlights. It was a miracle. They had even escaped Damon. The thing now was to be very quiet and to try to get through the Old Wood without disturbing anything. Maybe they could find their way back to the real boardinghouse, they decided. Then they could figure out how to save Elena from Damon and his two friends. Even Matt finally had to admit that it was unlikely that they would be able to overcome the three supernatural creatures by force. Bonnie just wished they\u0027d been able to take Isobel with them. \"Well, we have to go to the real boardinghouse anyway,\" Damon said, as Misao finally got Isobel subdued and semi-conscious. \"That\u0027s where Caroline will be.\" Misao stopped glaring at Isobel and seemed to start slightly. \"Caroline? Why do we want Caroline?\" \"It\u0027s all part of the fun, isn\u0027t it?\" Damon said in his most charming, flirtatious voice. Shinichi immediately stopped looking martyred and smiled. \"That girl - she\u0027s the one you\u0027ve been using as a carrier, right?\" He looked mischievously at his sister, whose smile seemed slightly strained. \"Yes, but - \" \"The more the merrier,\" Damon said, more cheerful with every minute. He didn\u0027t seem to notice Shinichi smirking at Misao behind his back. \"Don\u0027t sulk, darling,\" he said to her, tickling her under the chin while his golden eyes gleamed. \"I\u0027ve never set eyes on the girl. But of course, if Damon says it\u0027ll be fun, itwill be.\" The smirk became a full-fledged gloating smile. \"And there\u0027s no chance of any of them actually getting away at all?\" Damon said, almost absently, staring into the darkness of the Old Wood. \"Give me a little credit, please,\" the kitsune snapped. \"You\u0027re a damned - a vampire, aren\u0027t you?You\u0027re not supposed to hang out in the woods at all.\" \"It\u0027s my territory, along with the cemetery - \" Damon was beginning mildly, but Shinichi was determined to finish first this time. \"Ilive in the woods,\" he said. \"I control the bushes, the trees - and I\u0027ve brought a few of my own little experiments along with me. You\u0027ll all see them soon enough. So, to answer your question, no, not one of them is going to escape.\" \"That was all I asked,\" Damon said, still mildly, but locking gazes with the golden eyes for another long moment. Then he shrugged and turned away, eyeing the moon that could be seen between swirling clouds on the horizon. \"We\u0027ve got hours before the ceremony yet,\" Shinichi said, behind him. \"We\u0027re hardly going to be late.\" \"We\u0027d better not,\" Damon murmured. \"Caroline can do an awfully good impression of that pierced girl in hysterics when people are late.\" As a matter of fact, the moon was riding high in the sky as Caroline drove her mother\u0027s car to the porch of the boardinghouse. She was wearing an evening dress that looked as if it had been painted on her, in her favorite colors of bronze and green. Shinichi looked at Misao, who giggled with one hand covering her mouth and looked down. Damon walked Caroline up the porch steps to the front door and said, \"This way to the good seats.\" There was some bewilderment as people got themselves sorted out. Damon spoke cheerfully to Kristin and Tami and Ava: \"The peanut gallery for you three, I\u0027m afraid. That means you sit on the ground. But if you\u0027re good, I\u0027ll let you come sit up with us the next time.\" The others followed him with more or less exclamation, but it was Caroline who looked annoyed, saying, \"Why do we want to goinside ? I thought they were supposed to beoutside .\" \"Closest seats not in danger,\" Damon said briefly. \"We can get the best view from up there. Royal box seats, come on, now.\" The fox twins and the human girl followed him, switching on lights in the darkened house all the way up to the widow\u0027s walk on the roof. \"And now where are they?\" Caroline said, peering down. \"They\u0027ll be here any minute,\" Shinichi said, with a glance that was both puzzled and reproving. It said: Who does this girl think she is? He didn\u0027t spout any poetry. \"And Elena? She\u0027ll be here, too?\" Shinichi didn\u0027t answer that at all, and Misao just giggled. But Damon put his lips close to Caroline\u0027s ear and whispered. After that, Caroline\u0027s eyes shone green as a cat\u0027s. And the smile on her lips was the one of a cat who has just put its paw on the canary.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-return-nightfall-the-vampire-diaries-5/page-36.html","bookId":2035,"book":{"id":2035,"title":"The Return: Nightfall (The Vampire Diaries #5)","description":"Storyline: One week after Elena Gilbert has come back from the dead, she is in a childlike state, unable to read and almost completely unable to speak.
