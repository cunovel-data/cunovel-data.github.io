{"id":108786,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"Damon Salvatore was lounging in midair, nominally supported by one branch of a...who knew the names of trees anyway? Who gave a damn? It was tall, it allowed him to peep into Caroline Forbes\u0027s third-story bedroom, and it made a comfy backrest. He lay back in the convenient tree fork, hands clasped together behind his head, one neatly booted leg dangling over thirty feet of empty space. He was comfortable as a cat, eyes half-closed as he watched.\n He was waiting for the magic moment of 4:44A.M . to arrive, when Caroline would perform her bizarre ritual. He\u0027d already seen it twice and he was enthralled.\n Then he got a mosquito bite.\n Which was ridiculous because mosquitoes didn\u0027t prey on vampires. Their blood wasn\u0027t nutritious like human blood. But it certainly felt like a tiny mosquito bite on the back of his neck.\n He swiveled to see behind him, feeling the balmy summer night all around him - and saw nothing.\n The needles of some conifer. Nothing flying about. Nothing crawling on them.\n All right then. It must have been a conifer needle. But it certainly did hurt. And the pain got worse with time, not better.\n A suicidal bee? Damon felt the back of his neck carefully. No venom sack, no stinger. Just a tiny squishy lump that hurt.\n A moment later his attention was called back to the window.\n He wasn\u0027t sure exactly what was going on but he could feel the sudden buzzing of Power around the sleeping Caroline, like a high-tension wire. Several days ago, it had drawn him to this place, but once\n he\u0027d arrived he couldn\u0027t seem to find the source.\n The clock ticked 4:40 and beeped an alarm. Caroline woke and swatted it across the room.\n Lucky girl, Damon thought, with wicked appreciation. If I were a rogue human instead of a vampire, then your virtue - presuming you\u0027ve any left - might be in danger. Fortunately for you, I had to give up all that sort of thing nearly half a millennium ago.\n Damon flashed a smile at nothing in particular, held it for a twentieth of a second, and then turned it off, his black eyes going cold. He looked back into the open window.\n Yes...he\u0027d always felt that his idiot younger brother Stefan didn\u0027t appreciate Caroline Forbes enough. There was no doubt that the girl was worth looking at: long, golden-brown limbs, a shapely body, and bronze-colored hair that fell around her face in waves. And then there was her mind. Naturally skewed, vengeful, spiteful. Delicious. For instance, if he wasn\u0027t mistaken, she was working with little voodoo dolls on her desk in there.\n Terrific.\n Damon liked to see the creative arts at work.\n The alien Power still buzzed, and still he couldn\u0027t get a fix on it. Was it inside - in thegirl ? Surely not.\n Caroline was hastily grabbing for what looked like a handful of silken green cobwebs. She stripped her T-shirt off and - almost too fast for the vampire eye to see - had herself dressed in lingerie that made her look like a jungle princess. She stared intently at her own reflection in a stand-alone full-length mirror.\n Now, whatcan you be waiting for, little girl? Damon wondered.\n Well - he might as well keep a low profile. There was a dark flutter, one ebony feather fell to the ground, and then there was nothing but an exceptionally large crow sitting in the tree.\n Damon watched intently from one bright bird-eye as Caroline moved forward suddenly as if she\u0027d gotten an electric jolt, lips parted, her gaze on what seemed to be her own reflection.\n Then she smiled at it in greeting.\n Damon could pinpoint the source of Power now. It was inside the mirror. Not in the samedimension as the mirror, certainly, but contained inside it.\n Caroline was behaving - oddly. She tossed back her long bronze hair so that it fell in magnificent disarray down her back; she wet her lips and smiled as if at a lover. When she spoke, Damon could hear her quite clearly.\n \"Thank you. But you\u0027re late today.\"\n There was still no one but her in the bedroom, and Damon could hear no answer. But the lips of the Caroline in the mirror were not moving in synch with the real girl\u0027s lips.\n Bravo! he thought, always willing to appreciate a new trick on humans. Well done, whoever you are!\n Lip-reading the mirror girl\u0027s words, he caught something aboutsorry . Andlovely .\n Damon cocked his head.\n Caroline\u0027s reflection was saying, \"...you don\u0027thave to...after today.\"\n The real Caroline answered huskily. \"But what if I can\u0027t fool them?\"\n And the reflection: \"...have help. Don\u0027t worry, rest easy...\"\n \"Okay. And nobody will get, like,fatally hurt, right? I mean, we\u0027re not talking about death - forhumans .\"\n The reflection: \"Why should we...?\"\n Damon smiled inwardly. How many times had he heard exchanges likethat before? As a spider himself, he knew: First you got your fly into the parlor; then you reassured her; and before she knew it, you could have anything from her, until you didn\u0027tneed her any longer.\n And then - his black eyes glittered - it was time for a new fly.\n Now Caroline\u0027s hands were writhing in her lap. \"Just as long as you really - you know. What you promised. You really mean it about loving me?\"\n \"...trust me. I\u0027ll take care of you - and your enemies, too. I\u0027ve already begun...\"\n Suddenly Caroline stretched, and it was a stretch that boys at Robert E. Lee High School would have paid to watch. \"That\u0027s what I want to see,\" she said. \"I\u0027m justso sick of hearing about Elena this, Stefan that...and now it\u0027s going to start all over.\"\n Caroline broke off abruptly, as if someone had hung up on her on the phone and she\u0027d only just realized it. For a moment her eyes narrowed and her lips thinned. Then, slowly, she relaxed. Her eyes remained on the mirror, and one hand lifted until it was resting lightly on her stomach. She stared at it and slowly her features seemed to soften, to melt into an expression of apprehension and anxiety.\n But Damon hadn\u0027t taken his eyes off the mirror for an instant. Normal mirror, normal mirror, normal mirror - l���� era! Just at the last moment, as Caroline turned away, a flash of red.\n Flames?\n Now, whatcould be going on? he thought lazily, fluttering as he transformed from a sleek crow back into a drop-dead gorgeous young man lounging in a high branch of the tree. Certainly the mirror-creature wasn\u0027t from around Fell\u0027s Church. But it sounded as if it meant to make trouble for his brother, and a fragile, beautiful smile touched Damon\u0027s lips for a second.\n There was nothing he loved more than to watch self-righteous, sanctimonious, I\u0027m-better-than-you-cos-I-don\u0027t-drink-human-blood Stefan get in trouble.\n The teenagers of Fell\u0027s Church - and some of the adults - regarded the tale of Stefan Salvatore and their local beauty Elena Gilbert as a modern Romeo-and-Juliet story. She had given her life to save his when they\u0027d both been captured by a maniac, and afterward he had died of a broken heart. There were even whispers that Stefan had been notquite human...but something else. A demon lover that Elena had died to redeem.\n Damon knew the truth. Stefan was dead all right - but he had been dead for hundreds of years. And it was true that he was a vampire, but calling him a demon was like calling Tinkerbell armed and dangerous.\n Meanwhile Caroline couldn\u0027t seem to stop talking to an empty room.\n \"Just you wait,\" she whispered, walking over to the piles of untidy papers and books that littered her desk.\n She rummaged through the papers until she found a miniature video camera that had a green light shining at her like a single unblinking eye. Delicately, she connected the camera to her computer and began typing a password.\n Damon\u0027s eyesight was much better than a human\u0027s, and he could clearly see the tanned fingers with the long shining bronze nails:CFRULES . Caroline Forbes rules, he thought. Pitiful.\n Then she turned around, and Damon saw tears well up in her eyes. The next moment, unexpectedly, she was sobbing.\n She sat heavily on the bed, weeping and rocking herself back and forth, occasionally striking the mattress with a clenched fist. But mainly she just sobbed and sobbed.\n Damon was startled. But then custom took over and he murmured, \"Caroline? Caroline, may I come in?\"\n \"What? Who?\" She looked around frantically.\n \"It\u0027s Damon. May I come in?\" he asked, his voice dripping with mock sympathy, simultaneously using mind control on her.\n All vampires had such powers of control over mortals. How great the Power was depended on many things: the vampire\u0027s diet (human blood was by far the most potent), the strength of the victim\u0027s will, the relationship between the vampire and the victim, the fluctuation of day and night - and so many other things that even Damon didn\u0027t begin to understand. He only knew when he felt his own Power quicken, as it was quickening now.\n And Caroline was waiting.\n \"I can come in?\" he said in his most musical, most beguiling voice, at the same time crushing Caroline\u0027s strong will under one much stronger.\n \"Yes,\" she answered, wiping her eyes quickly, apparently seeing nothing unusual in his entrance by a third-story window. Their eyes locked. \"Come in, Damon.\"\n She had issued the necessary invitation for a vampire. With one graceful motion he swung himself over the sill. The interior of her room smelled like perfumes - and not subtle ones. He felt really quite savage now - it was surprising the way the bloodfever had come on so suddenly, so irresistibly. His upper canines had extended to about half again their size, and their edges were razor-sharp.\n This was no time for conversation, for loitering around as he usually did. For a gourmet, half the pleasure was in the anticipation, sure, but right now he was inneed . He drew strongly on his Power to control the human brain and gave Caroline a dazzling smile.\n That was all it took.\n Caroline had been moving toward him; now she stopped. Her lips, partly open to ask a question, remained parted; and her pupils suddenly widened as if she were in a dark room, and then contracted and remained contracted.\n \"I...I...\" she managed. \"Ohhh...\"\n There. She was his. And so easily, too.\n His fangs were throbbing with a kind of pleasurable pain, a tender soreness beckoning him to strike as quickly as the lunge of a cobra, to sink his teeth to the hilt in an artery. He was hungry - no,starving - and his whole body was burning with the urge to drink as deeply as he liked. After all, there were others to choose from if he drained this vessel dry.\n Carefully, never taking his eyes from hers, he lifted Caroline\u0027s head to expose her throat, with the sweet pulse throbbing in its hollow. It filled all his senses: the beating of her heart, the smell of the exotic blood just under the surface, dense and ripe and sweet. His head was spinning. He\u0027d never been so excited, so eager -\n So eager that it gave him pause. After all, one girl was as good as another, right? What was different about this time? What waswrong with him?\n And then he knew.\n I\u0027ll have my own mind back, thank you.\n Suddenly Damon\u0027s intellect was icy cold; the sensual aura in which he\u0027d been trapped frozen over instantly. He dropped Caroline\u0027s chin and stood very still.\n Hehad almost fallen under the influence of the thing that was using Caroline. It had been trying to snare him into breaking his word to Elena.\n And again, he could just barely sense a whisk of red in the mirror.\n It was one of those creatures drawn to the nova of Power that Fell\u0027s Church had become - he knew that. It had been using him, spurring him on, trying to get him to drain Caroline dry. To take all her blood, to kill a human, something he hadn\u0027t done since meeting Elena.\n Why?\n Coldly furious, he centered himself, and then probed in all directions with his mind to find the parasite. It should still be here; the mirror was only a portal for it to travel small distances. And it had been controlling him - him, Damon Salvatore - so it had to be very close indeed.\n Still, he could find nothing. That made him even angrier than before. Absently fingering the back of his neck, he sent a dark message:\n I will warn you once, and once only. Stay away from ME!\n He sent the thought out with a blast of Power that flashed like sheet lightning in his own senses. It ought to have knocked something dead nearby - from the roof, from the air, from a branch...maybe even from next door. Fromsomewhere , a creature should have plummeted to the ground, and he should have been able to sense it.\n But although Damon could feel clouds darkening above him in response to his mood, and the wind rubbing branches together outside, there was no falling body, no attempt at dying retaliation.\n He could find nothing close enough to have entered his thoughts, and nothing at a distance could be that strong. Damon might amuse himself sometimes by pretending to be vain, but underneath he had a cool and logical ability to analyze himself. He was strong. He knew that. As long as he kept himself well nourished and free of weakening sentiment, there were few creatures that could stand against him - at least in this plane.\n Two were right here in Fell\u0027s Church,a little mocking counterpoint in his mind said, but Damon shrugged that off disdainfully. Surely there could be no other vampire Elders nearby, or he would sense them. Ordinary vampires, yes, they were already flocking. But they were all too weak to enterhis mind.\n He was equally certain there was no creature within range that could challenge him. He would have sensed it as he sensed the blazing ley lines of uncanny magical power that formed a nexus under Fell\u0027s Church.\n He looked at Caroline again, still held motionless by the trance he\u0027d put on her. She would come out of it gradually, none the worse for the experience - for whathe\u0027d done to her, at least.\n He turned and, as gracefully as a panther, swung out of the window, onto the tree - and then dropped easily thirty feet to the ground. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-return-nightfall-the-vampire-diaries-5/page-2.html","bookId":2035,"book":{"id":2035,"title":"The Return: Nightfall (The Vampire Diaries #5)","description":"Storyline: \n One week after Elena Gilbert has come back from the dead, she is in a childlike state, unable to read and almost completely unable to speak.
