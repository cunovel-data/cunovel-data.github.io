{"id":108808,"no":26,"title":"Page 26","content":"Matt lunged at Damon in a rush that clearly demonstrated the skills that had gotten him a college football scholarship. He accelerated from utter stillness to a blur of motion, trying to tackle Damon, to bring him down.\n \"Run,\" he shouted, at the same instant.\"Run!\"\n Elena stood still, trying to come up with Plan A after this disaster. She had been forced to watch Stefan\u0027s humiliation at Damon\u0027s hands at the boardinghouse, but she didn\u0027t think she could stand to see this.\n But when she looked again, Matt was standing about a dozen yards from Damon, white-faced and grim, but alive and on his feet. He was preparing to rush Damon again.\n And Elena...couldn\u0027t run. She knew that it would probably be the best thing - Damon might punish Matt briefly but most of his attention would be turned to hunting her down.\n But she couldn\u0027t be sure. And she couldn\u0027t be sure that the punishment wouldn\u0027t kill Matt, or that he would be able to get away before Damon found her and had leisure time to think of him again.\n No, notthis Damon, pitiless and remorseless as he was.\n There must be some way - she could almost feel wheels spinning in her own head.\n And then she saw it.\n No, not that...\n But what else was there to do?\n Matt was, indeed, rushing Damon again, and this time as he went for him, lithe and unstoppable and fast as a darting snake, she saw what Damon did. He simply sidestepped at the last moment, just when Matt was about to ram him with a shoulder. Matt\u0027s momentum kept him going, but Damon simply turned in place and faced him again. Then he picked up his damned pine branch. It was broken at the end where Matt had trampled it.\n Damon frowned at the stick, then shrugged, lifting it - and then both he and Matt stopped frozen. Something came sailing in from the sidelines to settle on the ground between them. It lay there, stirring in the breeze.\n It was a maroon and navy Pendleton shirt.\n Both of the boys turned slowly toward Elena, who was wearing a white lacy camisole. She shivered slightly and wrapped her arms around herself. It seemed unusually cold for this time of evening.\n Very slowly, Damon lowered the pine branch.\n \"Saved by yourinamorata ,\" he said to Matt.\n \"I know what that means and it\u0027s not true,\" Matt said. \"She\u0027s my friend, not my girlfriend.\"\n Damon just smiled distantly. Elena could feel his eyes on her bare arms. \"So...on to the next step,\" he said.\n Elena wasn\u0027t surprised. Heartsick but not surprised. Neither was she surprised to see, when Damon turned to look from her to Matt and back, a flash of red. It seemed to be reflected on the inside of his sunglasses.\n \"Now,\" he said to Elena. \"I think we\u0027ll put you over there on that rock, sort of half reclining. But first - another kiss.\" He looked back at Matt. \"Get with the program, Matt; you\u0027re wasting time. First, maybe you kiss her hair, then she throws her head back and you kiss her neck, while she puts her arms around your shoulders....\"\n Matt,thought Elena. Damon had saidMatt . It had slipped out so easily, so innocently. Suddenly her entire brain, and her body, too, seemed to be vibrating as if to a single note of music, seemed to be flooded by an icy shower-bath. And what the note was saying was not shocking, because it was something that somehow, at a subliminal level, she already knew....\n That\u0027s not Damon.\n This wasn\u0027t the person she had known for - was it really only nine or ten months? She had seen him when she was a human girl, and she had defied him and desired him in equal measure - and he had seemed to love her best when she was defying him.\n She had seen him when she was a vampire and had been drawn to him with all her being, and he had cared for her as if she were a child.\n She had seen him when she was a spirit, and from the afterlife she had learned a great deal.\n He was a womanizer, he could be callous, he drifted through his victims\u0027 lives like a chimera, like a catalyst, changing other people while he himself remained unchanging and unchanged. He mystified humans, confused them, used them - leaving them bewildered, because he had the charm of the devil.\n And never once had she seen him break his word. She had a rock-bottom feeling that this wasn\u0027t something that was a decision, it was so much a part of Damon, lodged so deep in his subconscious, that even he couldn\u0027t do anything to change it. He couldn\u0027t break his word. He\u0027d starve first.\n Damon was still talking to Matt, giving him orders. \"...and then take off her...\"\n So what about his word to be her bodyguard, to keep her from harm?\n He was talking to her now. \"So you know when to throw your head back? After he - \"\n \"Who are you?\"\n \"What?\"\n \"You heard me.Who are you? If you had really seen Stefan off and promised him to take care of me, none of this would have happened. Oh, you might be messing with Matt, but not in front of me. You\u0027re not - Damon\u0027s not stupid. He knows what a bodyguard is. He knows that watching Matt in pain hurts me as well. You\u0027re not Damon. Who...are...you?\"\n Matt\u0027s strength and fast-as-a-rattlesnake speed hadn\u0027t done any good. Maybe a different approach would work. As Elena spoke, she had been very slowly reaching up to Damon\u0027s face. Now, with one motion, she pulled his sunglasses off.\n Eyes red as fresh new blood shone out at her.\n \"What have you done?\"she whispered. \"What have you done to Damon?\"\n Matt was out of the range of her voice but had been inching around, trying to get her attention. She wished fervently that Matt would just make a run for it himself. Here, he was just another way for this creature to blackmail her.\n Without seeming to move quickly, the Damon-thing reached down and snatched the sunglasses from her hand. It was too fast for her to resist.\n Then he seized her wrist in a painful grip.\n \"This would be a lot easier on both of you if you\u0027d cooperate,\" he said casually. \"You don\u0027t seem to realize what might happen if you make me angry.\"\n His grip was forcing her down, forcing her to kneel. Elena decided not to let it. But unfortunately her body didn\u0027t want to cooperate; it sent urgent messages of pain to her mind, of agony, of burning, searing agony. She had thought that she could ignore it, could stand to let him break her wrist. She was wrong. At some point something in her brain blacked out completely, and the next thing she knew she was on her knees with a wrist that felt three times the right size and burned fiercely.\n \"Human weakness,\" Damon said scornfully. \"It will get you every time.... You should know better than to disobey me, by now.\"\n Not Damon,Elena thought, so vehemently that she was surprised the imposter didn\u0027t hear her.\n \"All right,\" Damon\u0027s voice continued above her as cheerfully as if he\u0027d simply given her a suggestion. \"You go sit on that rock, leaning backward, and Matt, if you\u0027ll just come over here, facing her.\" The tone was of polite command, but Matt ignored it and was beside her already, looking at the finger marks on Elena\u0027s wrist as if he didn\u0027t believe them.\n \"Matt stands up, Elena sits, or the opposite one gets the full treatment. Have fun, kiddies.\" Damon had the palm-camera out again.\n Matt consulted Elena with his eyes. She looked at the imposter and said, enunciating carefully, \"Go to hell, whoever you are.\"\n \"Been there, done that, bought the brimstone,\" the not-Damon creature rattled off. He gave Matt a smile that was both luminescent and terrifying. Then he waggled the pine branch.\n Matt ignored it. He waited, his face stoic, for the pain to hit.\n Elena struggled up to stand by him. Side by side, they could defy Damon.\n Who seemed for a moment to be out of his mind. \"You\u0027re trying to pretend you\u0027re not afraid of me. But you will be. If you had any sense, you would be now.\"\n Belligerently, he took a step toward Elena.\"Why aren\u0027t you afraid of me?\"\n \"Whoever you are, you\u0027re just an oversized bully. You\u0027ve hurt Matt. You\u0027ve hurt me. I\u0027m sure you can kill us. But we\u0027re not afraid of bullies.\"\n \"You will be afraid.\" Now Damon\u0027s voice had dropped to a menacing whisper. \"Just wait.\"\n Even as something was ringing in Elena\u0027s ears, telling her to listen to those last words, to make a connection - who did that sound like? - the pain hit.\n Her knees were knocked out by it. But she wasn\u0027t just kneeling now. She was trying to roll into a ball, trying to curl around the agony. All rational thought was swept from her head. She sensed Matt beside her, trying to hold her, but she could no more communicate with him than she could fly. She shuddered and fell to her side, as if having a seizure. Her entire universe was pain, and she only heard voices as if they came from far away.\n \"Stop it!\" Matt sounded frantic.\"Stop it! Are you crazy? That\u0027sElena , for God\u0027s sake! Do you want to kill her ?\"\n And then the not-Damon-thing advising him mildly, \"I wouldn\u0027t try that again,\" but the only sound Matt made was a scream of primal rage.\n \"Caroline!\" Bonnie was raging, pacing back and forth in Stefan\u0027s room while Meredith did something else with the computer. \"Howdare she?\"\n \"She doesn\u0027t dare try to attack Stefan or Elena outright - there\u0027s the oath,\" Meredith said. \"So she\u0027s thought this up to get at all of us.\"\n \"But Matt - \"\n \"Oh, Matt\u0027s handy,\" Meredith said grimly. \"And unfortunately there\u0027s the matter of the physical evidence on both of them.\"\n \"What do you mean? Matt doesn\u0027t - \"\n \"The scratches, my dear,\" put in Mrs. Flowers, looking sad, \"from your razor-toothed bug. The poultice I put on will have healed them so that they\u0027ll look like a girl\u0027s fingernail scratches - about now. And the mark it left on your neck...\" Mrs. Flowers coughed delicately. \"It looks like what in my day was called a \u0026iexcl;\u0026reg;love bite.\u0027 Perhaps a sign of a tryst that ended in force? Not that your friend would ever do anything like that.\"\n \"And remember how Caroline looked when we saw her, Bonnie?\" Meredith said dryly. \"Not the crawling around - I\u0027ll bet anything she\u0027s walking just fine now. But her face. She had a black eye coming in and a swollen cheek. Perfect for the time frame.\"\n Bonnie felt as if everyone was two steps ahead of her. \"Whattime frame?\"\n \"The night the bug attacked Matt. It was the morning after that that the sheriff called and talked to him. Matt admitted that his mother hadn\u0027t seen him all night, and that Neighborhood Watch guy saw Matt drive up to his house and, basically, pass out.\"\n \"That was from the bug poison. He\u0027d just been fighting the malach!\"\n \"We know that. But they\u0027ll say he\u0027d just come back from attacking Caroline. Caroline\u0027s mother will hardly be fit to testify - you saw how she was. So who\u0027s to say that Matt wasn\u0027t over at Caroline\u0027s? Especially if he was planning assault.\"\n \"We are! We can vouch for him - \" Bonnie suddenly stumbled to a halt. \"No, I guess it was after he left that this was supposed to have happened. But, no, this is all wrong!\" She took up pacing again. \"I saw one of those bugs up close and it was exactly the way Matt described....\"\n \"And what\u0027s left of it now? Nothing. Besides, they\u0027ll say that you would sayanything for him.\"\n Bonnie couldn\u0027t stand just walking aimlessly around anymore. She had to get to Matt, had to warn him - if they could even find him or Elena. \"I thoughtyou were the one who couldn\u0027t wait a minute to find them,\" she said accusingly to Meredith.\n \"I know; I was. But I had to look something up - and besides I wanted one more try at that page only vampires are supposed to read. TheShi no Shi one. But I\u0027ve tweaked the screen in all the ways I can think of, and if there\u0027s something written here, I certainly can\u0027t find it.\"\n \"Best not to waste more time on it, then,\" Mrs. Flowers said. \"Come get into your jacket, my dear. Shall we take the Yellow Wheeler or not?\"\n For just a moment Bonnie had a wild vision of a horse-drawn vehicle, a sort of Cinderella carriage but not pumpkin-shaped. Then she remembered seeing Mrs. Flowers\u0027 ancient Model T - painted yellow - parked inside what must be the old stables that belonged to the boardinghouse.\n \"We did better when we were on foot than weor Matt did in a car,\" said Meredith, giving the computer monitor controls a final vicious click. \"We\u0027re more mobile than - oh, my God!I did it! \"\n \"Did what?\"\n \"The website. Come look at this.\"\n Both Bonnie and Mrs. Flowers came over to the computer. The screen was bright green with thin, faint, dark green writing.\n \"Howdid you do it?\" Bonnie demanded as Meredith bent to get a notebook and pen to copy down what they saw.\n \"I don\u0027t know. I just tweaked the color settings one last time - I\u0027d already tried it for Power Saver, Low Battery, High Resolution, High Contrast, and every combination I could think of.\"\n They stared at the words.\n Tired of that lapis lazuli?\n Want to take a vacation in Hawaii?\n Sick of that same old liquid cuisine?\n Come and visit Shi no Shi.\n After that came an ad for the \"Death of Death,\" a place where vampires could be cured of their cursed state and become human again. And then there was an address. Just a city road, no mention of what state, or, for that matter, what city. But it was a Clue.\n \"Stefan didn\u0027t mention a road address,\" Bonnie said.\n \"Maybe he didn\u0027t want to scare Elena,\" Meredith said grimly. \"Or maybe, when he looked at the page, the address wasn\u0027t there.\"\n Bonnie shivered. \"Shi no Shi - I don\u0027t like the sound of it. And don\u0027t laugh at me,\" she added to Meredith defensively. \"Remember what Stefan said about trusting my intuition?\"\n \"Nobody\u0027s laughing, Bonnie. We need to get to Elena and Matt. What does your intuition tell you about that?\"\n \"It says that we\u0027re going to get into trouble, and that Matt and Elena are in trouble already.\"\n \"Funny, because that\u0027s just what my judgment tells me.\"\n \"Are we ready, now?\" Mrs. Flowers handed out flashlights.\n Meredith tried hers and found it had a strong, steady beam.\n \"Let\u0027s do it,\" she said, automatically flipping off Stefan\u0027s lamp again.\n Bonnie and Mrs. Flowers followed her down the stairs, out of the house, and onto the street they had run from not so long ago. Bonnie\u0027s pulse was racing, her ears ready for the slightestwhipwhip sound. But except for the beams of their flashlights, the Old Wood was completely dark and eerily silent. Not even the sound of birdsong broke the moonless night.\n They plunged in, and in minutes they were lost.\n Matt woke up on his side and for a moment didn\u0027t know where he was. Outdoors. Ground. Picnic? Hiking? Fell asleep?\n And then he tried to move and agony flared like a geyser of flame, and he remembered everything. That bastard , torturing Elena, he thought.\n Torturing Elena.\n It didn\u0027t go together, not withDamon . What was it Elena had been saying to him at the end that had made him so angry?\n The thought nagged at him, but it was just another unanswered question, like Stefan\u0027s note in Elena\u0027s diary.\n Matt realized that he could move, if very slowly. He looked around, moving his head by careful increments until he saw Elena, lying near him like a broken doll. He hurt and he was desperately thirsty. She would feel the same way. The first thing was to get her to a hospital; the kind of muscular contractions brought on by that degree of pain could break an arm or even a leg. They were certainly strong enough to cause a sprain or dislocation. Not to mention Damon spraining her wrist.\n That was what the practical, sensible part of him was thinking. But the question that kept going around in his mind still made him reel in complete astonishment.\n Hehurt Elena? The way he hurt me? I don\u0027t believe it. I knew he was sick, twisted, but I never heard of him hurting the girls. And never, never Elena.Never . But me - if he treats me the way he treats Stefan, he\u0027ll kill me. I don\u0027t have a vampire\u0027s resilience.\n I have to get Elena out of this before he kills me. I can\u0027t leave her alone with him.\n Instinctively, somehow, he knew that Damon was still around. This was confirmed when he heard some little noise, turned his head too fast, and found himself staring at a blurred and wobbling black boot. The blur and wobble were the result of turning too quickly, but as quickly as he\u0027d turned, he\u0027d suddenly felt his face pressed into the dirt and pine needles on the ground of the clearing.\n By The Boot. It was on his neck, grinding his face into the dirt now. Matt made a wordless sound of pure fury and grabbed at the leg above the boot with both hands, trying to get a purchase and throw Damon off. But while he could grasp the smooth leather of the boot, moving it in any direction was impossible. It was as if the vampire in the boot could turn himself to iron. Matt could feel the tendons in his throat stand out, his face turn red, and his muscles bunch under his shirt as he made a violent effort to heave Damon off. At last, exhausted, chest heaving, he lay still.\n In that very same instant, The Boot was lifted. Exactly, he realized, at the moment when he was too tired to lift his head himself. He made a supreme effort and lifted it a few inches.\n And The Boot caught him under the chin and lifted his face a little higher.\n \"What a pity,\" Damon said with infuriating contempt. \"You humans are so weak. It\u0027s no fun to play with you at all.\"\n \"Stefan...will come back,\" Matt got out, looking up at Damon from where he was unintentionally groveling on the ground. \"Stefan will kill you.\"\n \"Guess what?\" Damon said conversationally. \"Your face is all messed up on one side - scratches, you know. You\u0027ve got sort of a Phantom of the Opera thing going on.\"\n \"If he doesn\u0027t, I will. I don\u0027t know how, but I will. I swear it.\"\n \"Careful what you promise.\"\n Just as Matt got his arm working enough to prop him up - exactly then, to the millisecond - Damon reached out and grabbed him painfully by a handful of hair, yanking his head up.\n \"Stefan,\" Damon said, looking straight down into Matt\u0027s face and forcing Matt to look up at him, no matter how Matt tried to turn his face away, \"was only powerful for a few days because he was drinking the blood of a very powerful spirit who hadn\u0027t yet adapted to Earth yet. But look at her now.\" He twisted his grip on Matt\u0027s hair again, more painfully. \"Some spirit. Lying there in the dirt. Now the Power is back where it should be. Do you understand?Do you - boy?\"\n Matt just stared at Elena. \"How could you do that?\" he whispered finally.\n \"An object lesson in what it means to defy me. And surely you wouldn\u0027t want me to be sexist and leave her out?\" Damontched . \"You have to keep up with the times.\"\n Matt said nothing. He had to get Elena out of this.\n \"Worrying about the girl? She\u0027s just playing possum now. Hoping I\u0027ll ignore her and concentrate on you.\"\n \"You\u0027re a liar.\"\n \"So I\u0027ll concentrate on you. Speaking of keeping up with the times, you know - except for the scratches and things, you\u0027re a fine-looking young man.\"\n At first the words meant nothing to Matt. When he understood them, Matt could feel his blood freeze in his body.\n \"As a vampire, I can give you an informed and honest opinion. And as a vampire, I\u0027m getting very thirsty. There\u0027s you. And then there\u0027s the girl who\u0027s still pretending to be asleep. I\u0027m sure you can see what I\u0027m getting at.\"\n I believe in you, Elena, Matt thought. He\u0027s a liar, and he\u0027ll always be a liar. \"Take my blood,\" he said wearily.\n \"Are you sure?\" Now Damon sounded solicitous. \"If you resist, the pain is horrible.\"\n \"Just get it over with.\"\n \"Whatever you like.\" Damon knelt fluidly on one knee, at the same time twisting his grip on Matt\u0027s hair, making Matt wince. The new grip dragged Matt\u0027s upper body across Damon\u0027s knee, so that his head was thrown back, his neck arched and exposed. In fact Matt had never felt so exposed, so helpless, so vulnerable in his life.\n \"You can always change your mind,\" Damon taunted him.\n Matt shut his eyes, stubbornly saying nothing.\n At the last moment, though, as Damon bent with fangs exposed, Matt\u0027s fingers almost involuntarily, almost as if it were something his body was doingapart from his mind, clenched themselves into a fist and he suddenly, unpredictably, brought the fist swinging up to deal a violent blow to Damon\u0027s temple. But - serpent-quick - Damon reached up and caught the blow almost nonchalantly in an open hand, and held Matt\u0027s fingers in a crushing grip - just as razor-sharp fangs opened a vein in Matt\u0027s throat and an open mouth fastened on his exposed throat, sucking and drinking the blood that sprayed upward.\n Elena - awake but unable to move from where she had fallen, unable to make a sound or turn her head - was forced to listen to the entire exchange, forced to hear Matt\u0027s groan as his blood was taken against his will, as he resisted to the last.\n And then she thought of something that, as dizzy and frightened as she was, almost made her pass out in fear.\n \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-return-nightfall-the-vampire-diaries-5/page-26.html","bookId":2035,"book":{"id":2035,"title":"The Return: Nightfall (The Vampire Diaries #5)","description":"Storyline: \n One week after Elena Gilbert has come back from the dead, she is in a childlike state, unable to read and almost completely unable to speak.
