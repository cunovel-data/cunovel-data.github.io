Ice-cold outside, manic inside - or was it the other way around? Still numb from the death of her parents so long ago. Jaded by the world and by anything to do with boys...A princess in an icy tower...with a lust only for conquest, for power...until she\u0027d seenhim .\n Believe.\n Then the world of the vampires...and Damon. And all the wicked wildness she\u0027d found inside herself, all the passion. Stefan was her lynchpin, but Damon was the fiery breath beneath her wings. However far she went, Damon seemed to lure her on just a little farther. And she knew that one day it would be too far...for both of them. But for now, all she had to do was simple.\n Believe.\n And Meredith, and Bonnie, and Matt. She had changed relations with them, oh, most definitely. At first, not knowing what she had done to deserve friends like these three, she hadn\u0027t even bothered to treat them as they deserved. Yet they had all stuck by her. And now shedid know how to appreciate them - knew that if it came to that, she would die for them.\n Below, Bonnie\u0027s eyes had followed her dive. The audience on the widow\u0027s walk looked, too, but it was Bonnie\u0027s face that she stared into: Bonnie startled and terrified and disbelieving and about to scream and realizing at the same time that no screaming would save Elena from a headlong dive to her death.\n Bonnie, believe in me. I\u0027ll save you.\n I remember how to fly.\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-return-nightfall-the-vampire-diaries-5/page-38.html","bookId":2035,"book":{"id":2035,"title":"The Return: Nightfall (The Vampire Diaries #5)","description":"Storyline: \n One week after Elena Gilbert has come back from the dead, she is in a childlike state, unable to read and almost completely unable to speak.
