Postwar quiet.\\n\\n Later, we’ll try to make sense of this. Eventually, the bruises will fade.\\n\\n But for now, he reaches over and puts his hand on top of my hand, curling his fingers into the spaces between mine, closing them around my palm until they’re laced tightly, locked together, school behind us, and I realize Anna is right.\\n\\n A whole world exists outside of that hellhole.\\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/some-girls-are/page-36.html","bookId":1896,"book":{"id":1896,"title":"Some Girls Are","description":"Storyline: Climbing to the top of the social ladder is hard—falling from it is even harder. Regina Afton used to be a member of the Fearsome Fivesome, an all-girl clique both feared and revered by the students at Hallowell High... until vicious rumors about her and her best friend\u0027s boyfriend start going around. Now Regina\u0027s been \"frozen out\" and her ex-best friends are out for revenge. If Regina was guilty, it would be one thing, but the rumors are far from the terrifying truth and the bullying is getting more intense by the day. She takes solace in the company of Michael Hayden, a misfit with a tragic past who she herself used to bully. Friendship doesn\u0027t come easily for these onetime enemies, and as Regina works hard to make amends for her past, she realizes Michael could be more than just a friend... if threats from the Fearsome Foursome don\u0027t break them both first.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/some-girls-are.jpg","author":"Courtney Summers","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/some-girls-are.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:57 PM"}}
