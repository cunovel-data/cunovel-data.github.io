That\u0027s all they\u0027re talking about in the chat rooms.\" \"That figures,\" David said. \"But what\u0027s the - ?\" \"It\u0027s all negative, David. They\u0027re saying that Ashley is guilty and that she should be executed. And they\u0027re saying it in very colorful ways. You can\u0027t believe how vicious they are.\" David, suddenly realizing, said, \"Oh, my God! If any of the jurors are on the Internet - \" \"The odds are pretty good that some of them are, and they\u0027ll be influenced. I would ask for a mistrial, or at the very least, to have the jurors sequestered.\" \"Thanks, Jesse. Will do.\" David replaced the receiver. When he returned to the restaurant where Sandra was waiting, she asked, \"Bad?\" \"Bad.\" Before court convened the following morning, David asked to see Judge Williams. He was ushered into her chambers, along with Mickey Brennan. \"You asked to see me?\" \"Yes, Your Honor. I learned last night that this trial is the number one subject on the Internet. It\u0027s what all the chat rooms are discussing, and they\u0027ve already convicted the defendant. It\u0027s very prejudicial. And since I\u0027m sure that some of the jurors have computers with on-line access, or talk to friends who have on-line access, it could seriously damage the defense. Therefore, I\u0027m making a motion for a mistrial.\" She was thoughtful for a moment. \"Motion denied.\" David sat there, fighting to control himself. \"Then I make a motion to immediately sequester the jury so that - \" \"Mr. Singer, every day the press is at this courtroom in full force. This trial is the number one topic on television, on radio and in the newspapers all over the world. I waned you that this was going to turn into a circus, and you wouldn\u0027t listen.\" She leaned forward. \"Well, it\u0027s your circus, if you wanted the jury sequestered, you should have made that motion before the trial. And I probably would not have granted it. Is there anything else?\" David sat there, his stomach churning. \"No, Your Honor.\" \"Then let\u0027s get into the courtroom.\" Mickey Brennan was questioning Sheriff Dowling. \"Deputy Sam Blake called to tell you that he was going to spend the night at the defendant\u0027s apartment in order to protect her? She told him that someone was threatening her life?\" \"That is correct.\" \"When did you hear from deputy Blake again?\" \"I - I didn\u0027t. I got a call in the morning that his - his body had been found in the alley in back of Miss Patterson\u0027s apartment building.\" \"And of course you went there immediately?\" \"Of course.\" \"And what did you find?\" He swallowed. \"Sam\u0027s body was wrapped in a bloody sheet. He had been stabbed to death and castrated like the other two victims.\" \"Like the other two victims. So all those murders were carried out in a similar fashion?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"As though they were killed by the same person?\" David was on his feet. \"Objection!\" \"Sustained.\" \"I\u0027ll withdraw that. What did you do next. Sheriff?\" \"Well, up until that time, Ashley Patterson wasn\u0027t a suspect. But after this happened, we took her in and had her fingerprints taken.\" \"And then?\" \"We sent them to the FBI, and we got a positive make on her.\" \"Would you explain to the jury what you mean by a positive make?\" Sheriff Dowling turned to the jury. \"Her fingerprints matched other fingerprints on file that they were trying to identify from the previous murders.\" \"Thank you. Sheriff.\" Brennan turned to David. \"Your witness.\" David got up and walked over to the witness box. \"Sheriff, we\u0027ve heard testimony in this courtroom that a bloody knife was found in Miss Patterson\u0027s kitchen.\" \"That\u0027s right.\" \"How was it hidden? Wrapped up in something? Stashed away where it couldn\u0027t be found?\" \"No. It was right out in the open.\" \"Right out in the open. Left there by someone who had nothing to hide. Someone who was innocent because - \" \"Objection!\" \"Sustained.\" \"No more questions.\" \"The witness is dismissed.\" Brennan said, \"If it pleases the court...\" He signaled someone at the back of the courtroom, and a man in overalls came in, carrying the mirror from Ashley Patterson\u0027s medicine cabinet. On it, in red lipstick, was written YOU WILL DIE. David rose. \"What is this?\" Judge Williams turned to Mickey Brennan. \"Mr. Brennan?\" \"This is the bait the defendant used to get deputy Blake to come to her apartment so she could murder him. I would like this marked as exhibit D. It came from the medicine chest of the defendant.\" \"Objection, Your Honor. It has no relevance.\" \"I will prove that there is a relevance.\" \"We\u0027ll see. In the meantime, you may proceed.\" Brennan placed the mirror in full view of the jury. \"This minor was taken from the defendant\u0027s bathroom.\" He looked at the jurors. \"As you can see, scrawled across it is \u0027You Will Die.\u0027 This was the defendant\u0027s pretext for having deputy Blake come to her apartment that night to protect her.\" He turned to Judge Williams. \"I would like to call my next witness. Miss Laura Niven.\" A middle-aged woman walking with a cane approached the witness box and was sworn in. \"Where do you work. Miss Niven?\" \"I\u0027m a consultant for the County of San Jose.\" \"And what do you do?\" \"I\u0027m a handwriting expert.\" \"How long have you worked for the county. Miss Niven?\" \"Twenty-two years.\" Brennan nodded toward the mirror. \"You have been shown this mirror before?\" \"Yes.\" \"And you\u0027ve examined it?\" \"I have.\" \"And you\u0027ve been shown an example of the defendant\u0027s handwriting?\" \"Yes.\" \"And had a chance to examine that?\" \"Yes.\" \"And you\u0027ve compared the two?\" \"I have.\" \"And what is your conclusion?\" \"They were written by the same person.\" There was a collective gasp from the courtroom. \"So what you\u0027re saying is that Ashley Patterson wrote this threat to herself?\" \"That is correct.\" Mickey Brennan looked over at David. \"Your witness.\" David hesitated. He glanced at Ashley. She was staring down at the table, shaking her head. \"No questions.\" Judge Williams was studying David. \"No questions, Mr. Singer?\" David rose to his feet. \"No. All this testimony is meaningless.\" He turned to the jury. \"The prosecution will have to prove that Ashley Patterson knew the victims and had a motive to - \" Judge Williams said angrily, \"I\u0027ve warned you before. It is not your place to instruct the jury on the law. If - \" \"Someone has to,\" David exploded. \"You\u0027re letting him get away with - \" \"That\u0027s enough, Mr. Singer. Approach the bench.\" David walked to the bench. \"I\u0027m citing you for contempt of court and sentencing you to a night here in our nice jail the day this trial is over.\" \"Wait, Your Honor. You can\u0027t - \" She said grimly, \"I\u0027ve sentenced you to one night. Would you like to try for two?\" David stood there, glaring at her, taking deep breaths. \"For the sake of my client, I\u0027ll - I\u0027ll keep my feelings to myself.\" \"A wise decision,\" Judge Williams said curtly. \"Court is adjourned.\" She turned to a bailiff. \"When this trial is ended, I want Mr. Singer taken into custody.\" \"Yes, Your Honor.\" Ashley turned to Sandra. \"Oh, my God! What\u0027s happening?\" Sandra squeezed her arm. \"Don\u0027t worry. You have to trust David.\" Sandra telephoned Jesse Quiller. \"I heard,\" he said. \"It\u0027s all over the news, Sandra. I don\u0027t blame David for losing his temper. She\u0027s been goading him from the beginning. What did David do to get her so down on him?\" \"I don\u0027t know, Jesse. It\u0027s been horrible. You should see the faces of the jurors. They hate Ashley. They can\u0027t wait to convict her. Well, it\u0027s the defense\u0027s turn next. David will change their minds.\" \"Hold the thought.\" \"Judge Williams hates me, Sandra, and it\u0027s banning Ashley. If I don\u0027t do something about this, Ashley is going to die. I can\u0027t let that happen.\" \"What can you do?\" Sandra asked. David took a deep breath. \"Resign from the case.\" Both of them knew what that meant. The media would be full of his failure. \"I never should have agreed to take on the trial,\" David said bitterly. \"Dr. Patterson trusted me to save his daughter\u0027s life, and I\u0027ve - \" He could not go on. Sandra put her arms around him and held him close. \"Don\u0027t worry, darling. Everything\u0027s going to turn out fine.\" I\u0027ve let everyone down, David thought. Ashley, Sandra... I\u0027m going to be kicked out of the firm, I won\u0027t have a job and the baby is due soon. \"Everything\u0027s going to turn out fine.\" Right. In the morning, David asked to see Judge Williams in her chambers. Mickey Brenman was there. Judge Williams said, \"You asked to see me, Mr. Singer?\" \"Yes, Your Honor. I want to resign from the case.\" Judge Williams said, \"On what grounds?\" David spoke carefully. \"I don\u0027t believe I\u0027m the right lawyer for this trial. I think I\u0027m hurting my client I would like to be replaced.\" Judge Williams said quietly, \"Mr. Singer, if you think I\u0027m going to let you walk away from this and then have to start this trial all over again and waste even more time and money, you\u0027re quite mistaken. The answer is no. Do you understand me?\" David closed his eyes for an instant, forcing himself to stay calm. He looked up and said, \"Yes, Your Honor. I understand you.\" He was trapped.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tell-me-your-dreams/page-17.html","bookId":2368,"book":{"id":2368,"title":"Tell Me Your Dreams","description":"Storyline: Computer whiz Ashley Patterson is convinced she is being stalked.
