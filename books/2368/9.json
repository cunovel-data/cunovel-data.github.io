She took a deep breath and tried again. Two... nine... nine... two... one... zero... one...\n The phone began to ring.\n \"Sheriff\u0027s Office.\"\n \"Deputy Blake, please. Hurry!\"\n \"Deputy Blake has gone home. Can someone else - ?\u0027\n \"No! I - Would you ask him to call me? This is Ashley Patterson. I need to talk to him right away.\"\n \"Let me put you on hold, miss, and I\u0027ll see if I reach him.\"\n Deputy Sam Blake was patiently listening to his wife Serena, screaming at him. \"My brother works you a horse, day and night, and he doesn\u0027t give you enough money to support me decently. Why don\u0027t you demand a raise? Why?\"\n They were at the dinner table. \"Would you pass the potatoes, dear?\"\n Serena reached over and slammed the dish of potatoes in front of her husband. \"The trouble is that they don\u0027t appreciate you.\"\n \"You\u0027re right, dear. May I have some gravy?\"\n \"Aren\u0027t you listening to what I\u0027m saying?\" she yelled.\n \"Every word, my love. This dinner is delicious. You\u0027re a great cook.\"\n \"How can I fight you, you bastard, if you won\u0027t fight back?\"\n He took a mouthful of veal. \"It\u0027s because I love you, darling.\"\n The telephone rang. \"Excuse me.\" He got up and picked up the receiver. \"Hello... Yes... Put her trough.... Miss Patterson?\" He could hear her sobbing.\n \"Something - something terrible has happened. You\u0027ve got to come over here right away.\"\n \"I\u0027m on my way.\"\n Serena got to her feet. \"What? You\u0027re going out? We are in the middle of dinner!\"\n \"It\u0027s an emergency, darling. I\u0027ll be back as soon as I can.\" She watched him strap on his gun. He leaned over kissed her. \"Wonderful dinner.\"\n * * *\n Ashley opened the door for him the instant he arrived. Her cheeks were tear stained. She was shivering.\n Sam Blake stepped into the apartment, looking around warily.\n \"Is anyone else here?\"\n \"S-someone was here.\" She was fighting for self-control. \"L-look....\" She led him to the bathroom.\n Deputy Blake read the words on the mirror out loud: \"You will die.\"\n He turned to Ashley. \"Do you have any idea who could have written that?\"\n \"No,\" Ashley said. \"This is my apartment. No one else has a key.... And someone has been coming in here.... Someone\u0027s been following me. Someone\u0027s planning to kill me.\" She burst into tears. \"I can\u0027t s-stand this any longer.\"\n She was sobbing uncontrollably. Deputy Blake put his arm around her and patted her shoulder. \"Come on. It\u0027s going to be all right. We\u0027ll give you protection, and we\u0027ll find out who\u0027s behind this.\"\n Ashley took a deep breath. \"I\u0027m sorry. I - I don\u0027t usually carry on like this. It\u0027s - it\u0027s just been horrible.\"\n \"Let\u0027s talk,\" Sam Blake said.\n She managed to force a smile. \"All right.\"\n \"How about a nice cup of tea?\"\n They sat talking over cups of hot tea.\n \"When did all this start, Miss Patterson?\"\n \"About - about six months ago. I felt I was being followed. At first it was just a vague feeling, but then it began to grow. I knew I was being followed, but I couldn\u0027t see anyone. Then at work, someone got into my computer and drew a picture of a hand with a knife in it trying to - to stab me.\"\n \"And do you have any idea who it could have been?\"\n \"No.\"\n \"You said someone has gotten into this apartment before today?\"\n \"Yes. Once, someone turned on all the lights when I was gone. Another time I found a cigarette butt on my dressing table. I don\u0027t smoke. And someone opened a drawer and went through my... my underwear.\" She took a deep breath. \"And now... this.\"\n \"Do you have any boyfriends who might feel rejected?\"\n Ashley shook her head. \"No.\"\n \"Have you had any business dealings where somebody\u0027s lost money because of you?\"\n \"No.\"\n \"No threats from anyone?\"\n \"No.\" She thought of telling him about the lost weekend in Chicago, but that might involve mentioning her father. She decided to say nothing.\n \"I don\u0027t want to be alone here tonight,\" Ashley said.\n \"All right. I\u0027ll call the station and have them send someone here to - \"\n \"No! Please! I\u0027m afraid to trust anyone else. Could you stay here with me, just until morning?\"\n \"I don\u0027t think I - \"\n \"Oh, please.\" She was trembling.\n He looked into her eyes and thought he had never seen anyone so terrified.\n \"Isn\u0027t there someplace you could stay tonight? Don\u0027t you have any friends who - ?\"\n \"What if it\u0027s one of my friends who\u0027s doing this?\"\n He nodded. \"Right. I\u0027ll stay. In the morning, I\u0027ll arrange for twenty-four-hour protection for you.\"\n \"Thank you.\" Her voice was filled with relief.\n He patted Ashley\u0027s hand. \"And don\u0027t worry. I promise you that we\u0027ll get to the bottom of this. Let me call Sheriff Dowling and tell him what\u0027s going on.\"\n He spoke on the phone for five minutes, and when he bung up, he said, \"I\u0027d better call my wife.\"\n \"Of course.\"\n Deputy Blake picked up the telephone again and dialed. \"Hello, darling. I won\u0027t be home tonight, so why don\u0027t you watch some tel - ?\"\n \"You won\u0027t what? Where are you, with one of your cheap whores?\"\n Ashley could hear her screaming over the phone.\n \"Serena - \"\n \"You\u0027re not fooling me.\"\n \"Serena - \"\n \"That\u0027s all you men think about - getting laid.\"\n \"Serena - \"\n \"Well, I won\u0027t put up with it any longer.\"\n \"Serena - \"\n \"That\u0027s the thanks I get for being such a go wife....\"\n The one-sided conversation went on for another ten minutes. Finally, Deputy Blake replaced the receiver a turned to Ashley, embarrassed.\n \"I\u0027m sorry about that. She\u0027s not like that.\"\n Ashley looked at him and said, \"I understand.\"\n \"No - I mean it. Serena acts that way because she\u0027s scared.\"\n \"Ashley looked at him curiously. \"Scared?\"\n He was silent for a moment. \"Serena is dying. She has cancer. It was in remission for a while. It first started about seven years ago. We\u0027ve been married for five years.\"\n \"So you knew...?\"\n \"Yes. It didn\u0027t matter. I love her.\" He stopped. \"It\u0027s gotten worse lately. She\u0027s scared because she\u0027s afraid to die and she\u0027s afraid I\u0027ll leave her. All the yelling is a cover-up to hide that fear.\"\n \"I\u0027m - I\u0027m so sorry.\"\n \"She\u0027s a wonderful person. Inside, she\u0027s gentle and caring and loving. That\u0027s the Serena I know.\"\n Ashley said, \"I\u0027m sorry if I caused any - \"\n \"Not at all.\" He looked around.\n Ashley said, \"There\u0027s just the one bedroom. You can take it, and I\u0027ll sleep on the couch.\"\n Deputy Blake shook his head. \"The couch will be fine for me.\"\n Ashley said, \"I can\u0027t tell you how grateful I am.\"\n \"No problem. Miss Patterson.\" He watched her go into a linen closet and take out sheets and blankets.\n She walked over to the couch and spread the linen out. \"I hope that you\u0027ll - \"\n \"Perfect. I don\u0027t plan on doing much sleeping, anyway.\" He checked the windows to make sure they were locked and then walked over to the door and double-bolted it. \"All right.\" He placed his gun on the table next to the couch. \"You get a good night\u0027s sleep. In the morning, we\u0027ll get everything organized.\"\n Ashley nodded. She walked over to him and kissed him on the cheek. \"Thank you.\"\n Deputy Blake watched her walk into the bedroom and close the door. He walked back to the windows and checked them again. It was going to be a long night.\n At FBI headquarters in Washington, Special Agent Ra-mirez was talking to Roland Kingsley, the chief of his section.\n \"We have the fingerprints and DNA reports found at the murder scenes in Bedford, Cupertino, Quebec, and San Francisco. We just got in the final DNA report. The fingerprints from the scenes all match, and the DNA traces match.\"\n Kingsley nodded. \"So it\u0027s definitely a serial killer.\"\n \"No question.\"\n \"Let\u0027s find the bastard.\"\n At six o\u0027clock in the morning, deputy Sam Blake\u0027s naked body was found by the wife of the building superintendent in the alley that ran behind Ashley Patterson\u0027s apartment building.\n He had been stabbed to death and castrated. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tell-me-your-dreams/page-9.html","bookId":2368,"book":{"id":2368,"title":"Tell Me Your Dreams","description":"Storyline: \n Computer whiz Ashley Patterson is convinced she is being stalked.
