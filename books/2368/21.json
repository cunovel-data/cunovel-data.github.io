{"id":69145,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"HE rewrote the scenes in his mind, over and over again, endlessly.\n I saw the news this morning. Dr. Patterson. I can\u0027t tell you how very sorry I am.\n Yes. It\u0027s been quite a blow. I need your help, David.\n Of course. Anything I can do.\n I want you to represent Ashley.\n I can\u0027t do that. I\u0027m not a criminal defense lawyer. But I can recommend a great attorney, Jesse Quitter.\n That will be fine. Thank you, David....\n You\u0027re an anxious young fellow, aren\u0027t you? Our meeting wasn\u0027t supposed to be until five o\u0027clock. Well, I have good news for you. We\u0027re making you a partner.\n * * *\n You asked to see me?\n Yes, Your Honor. They\u0027re talking about this trial on the Internet, and they\u0027ve already convicted the defendant. This could seriously damage the defense. Therefore, I\u0027m making a motion for a mistrial.\n I think those are excellent grounds for a mistrial, Mr. Singer. I\u0027m going to grant it....\n The bitter-tasting game of \"what if.\"...\n The following morning, the court was in session.\n \"Is the prosecution ready to make its closing argument?\" Brennan stood up. He walked over to the jury box and looked at the jurors one by one.\n \"You\u0027re in a position to make history here. If you believe that the defendant is really a lot of different people and she\u0027s not responsible for what she\u0027s done, for the terrible crimes she committed, and you let her go, then you\u0027re saying that anybody can get away with murder by simply claiming that they didn\u0027t do it, that some mysterious alter ego did it. They can rob, rape and kill, and are they guilty? No. I didn\u0027t do it. My alter ego did it.\u0027 Ken or Joe or Suzy or whatever they want to call themselves. Well, I think you\u0027re all too intelligent to fall for that fantasy. The reality is in those photographs you looked at. Those people weren\u0027t murdered by any alter egos. They were all deliberately, calculatedly, cruelly murdered by the defendant sitting at that table, Ashley Patterson. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, what the defense has tried to do in this court has been tried before. In Mann Versus Teller, the decision was that a finding of MPD does not, per se, require a finding of acquittal. In United States Versus Whirley, a nurse who murdered a baby pleaded that she had MPD. The court found her guilty.\n \"You know, I almost feel sorry for the defendant.. All those characters living in that poor girl. I\u0027m sure none of us would want a bunch of crazy strangers moving around inside us, would we? Going around murdering and castrating men. I\u0027d be scared.\"\n He turned to look at Ashley. \"The defendant doesn\u0027t seem scared, does she? Not too scared to put on a pretty dress and comb her hair nicely and apply makeup. Six doesn\u0027t seem scared at all. She thinks you\u0027re going to believe her story and let her go. No one can prove whether this multiple personality disorder really exists at all, so we\u0027re going to have to make our own judgments.\n \"The defense claims that these characters come out and take over. Let\u0027s see - there\u0027s Toni; she was born ii England. And Alette; she was born in Italy. They\u0027re al the same person. They were just born in different countries at different times. Does that confuse you? I know it confuses me. I offered the defendant a chance to let us see her alters, but she didn\u0027t take me up on it. I wonder why? Could it be because they don\u0027t exist...? Does California law recognize MPD as a mental condition? No. Colorado law? No. Mississippi? No. Federal law? No. As a matter of fact, no state has a law confirming MPD as a legal defense. And why? Because it isn\u0027t a defense. Ladies and gentlemen, it\u0027s a fictitious alibi to punishment....\"\n \"What the defense is asking you to believe is that are two people inside the defendant, so no one bears any responsibility for her criminal actions. But there is only one defendant sitting in this courtroom - Ashley Patterson. We have proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that she is a murderer. But she claims she didn\u0027t commit the crimes. That was done by someone else, someone who borrowed her body to kill innocent people - her alters. Wouldn\u0027t it be wonderful if we all had alters, someone to carry out anything we secretly wanted done that society doesn\u0027t permit? Or maybe not. Would you like to live in a world where people could go around murdering others and say, \u0027You can\u0027t touch me, my alter did it\u0027 and \u0027You can\u0027t punish my alter because my alter is really me\u0027?\n \"But this trial is not about some mythical characters who don\u0027t exist. The defendant, Ashley Patterson, is on trial for three vicious, cold-blooded murders, and the state is asking the death penalty. Thank you.\"\n Mickey Brennan returned to his seat.\n \"Is the defense ready to present its closing argument?\"\n David rose. He walked to the jury box and looked into the faces of the jurors, and what he saw there was disheartening. \"I know that this has been a very difficult case for all of us. You\u0027ve heard experts testify that they\u0027ve treated multiple personality disorder, and you\u0027ve heard other experts testify that there is no such thing. You\u0027re not doctors, so no one expects you to make your judgment based on medical knowledge. I want to apologize to all of you if my behavior yesterday seemed boorish. I yelled at Ashley Patterson only because I wanted to force her alters to come out. I\u0027ve talked to those alters. I know they exist. There really is an Alette and a Toni, and they can control Ashley anytime they want to. She has no knowledge of committing any murders.\n \"I told you at the beginning of this trial that for someone to be convicted of first-degree murder, there has to be physical evidence and a motive. There is no motive here, ladies and gentlemen. None. And the law says that the prosecution must prove a defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll agree that in this case, there is a reasonable doubt.\n \"As far as proof is concerned, the defense does not question it. There are Ashley Patterson\u0027s fingerprints and traces of DNA at each of the crime scenes. But the very fact that they are there should give us pause. Ashley Patterson is an intelligent young woman. If she committed a murder and did not want to be caught, would she have been stupid enough to leave her fingerprints at each one of the scenes? The answer is no.\"\n David went on for another thirty minutes. At the end, he looked at their faces and was not reassured. He sat down.\n Judge Williams turned to the jurors. \"I want to instruct you now on the applicable law to this case. I want you to listen carefully.\" She talked for the next twenty minutes, detailing what was admissible and allowable by law.\n \"If you have any questions, or want any part of the testimony read back to you, the court reporter will do so. The jury is excused to go deliberate. Court is adjourned until they return with their verdict.\"\n David watched the jury file out of the box and into the jury room. The longer the jurors take, the better our chances, David thought. The jurors returned forty-five minutes later.\n David and Ashley watched as the jurors filed in and took their seats in the jury box. Ashley was stone-faced. David found that he was perspiring.\n Judge Williams turned to the jury foreman. \"Have the jurors reached a verdict?\"\n \"We have. Your Honor.\"\n \"Would you please hand it to the bailiff.\"\n The bailiff carried the piece of paper to the judge. Judge Williams unfolded it. There was not a sound in the courtroom.\n The bailiff returned the paper to the jury foreman. \"Would you read the verdict, please?\"\n In a slow, measured tone, he read, \"In the case of The People of the State of California Versus Ashley Patterson, we, the jury, in the above entitled action, find the defendant, Ashley Patterson, guilty of the murder of Dennis Tibble, a violation of Penal Code Section 187.\"\n There was a gasp in the courtroom. Ashley shut her eyes tightly.\n \"In the case of The People of the State of California Versus Ashley Patterson, we, the jury, in the above entitled action, find the defendant, Ashley Patterson, guilty of the murder of deputy Samuel Blake, a violation of Penal Code Section 187.\n \"In the case of The People of the State of California Versus Ashley Patterson, we, the jury, in the above entitled action, find the defendant, Ashley Patterson, guilty of the murder of Richard Melton, a violation of Penal Code Section 187. We, the jury, in all the verdicts, further fix the degree at first degree.\"\n David was finding it difficult to breathe. He turned to Ashley, but he had no words. He leaned over and put his arms around her.\n Judge Williams said, \"I would like to have the jury polled.\" One by one, each juror stood up.\n \"Was the verdict read, your verdict?\"\n And when each one had affirmed it, Judge Williams said, \"The verdict will be recorded and entered into the record.\" She went on. \"I want to thank the jury for their time and service in this case. You\u0027re dismissed. Tomorrow the court will take up the issue of sanity.\"\n David sat there, numb, watching Ashley being led away.\n Judge Williams got up and walked to her chambers without looking at David. Her attitude told David more clearly than words what her decision was going to be in the morning. Ashley was going to be sentenced to die.\n Sandra called from San Francisco. \"Are you all right, David?\"\n He tried to sound cheerful. \"Yes, I\u0027m great. How are you feeling?\"\n \"I\u0027m fine. I\u0027ve been watching the news on television. The judge wasn\u0027t fair to you. She can\u0027t have you disbarred. You were only trying to help your client.\"\n He had no answer.\n \"I\u0027m so sorry, David. I wish were with you. I could drive down and - \"\n \"No,\" David said. \"We can\u0027t take any chances. Did you see the doctor today?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"What did he say?\"\n \"Very soon now. Any day.\" Happy birthday, Jeffrey.\n Jesse Quiller called. \"I bungled it,\" David said.\n \"Like hell you did. You got the wrong judge. What did you ever do to get ho: so down on you?\"\n David said, \"She wanted me to plea-bargain. She didn\u0027t want this to go to trial. Maybe I should have listened to her.\"\n All the television channels were full of the news of his disgrace. He watched one of the network\u0027s legal experts discussing the case.\n \"I\u0027ve never heard of a defending attorney screaming at his own client before. I must tell you, the courtroom was stunned. It was one of the most outrageous - \"\n David switched off the station. Where did it all go wrong? Life is supposed to have a happy ending. Because I\u0027ve bungled everything, Ashley\u0027s going to die. I\u0027m going to be disbarred, the baby\u0027s going to be born any minute and I don\u0027t even have a job.\n He sat in his hotel room in the middle of the night, staring into the darkness. It was the lowest moment of his life. Playing over and over again in his mind was the final courtroom scene. \"You can\u0027t hypnotize her in my courtroom. The answer is no. \"\n If only she had let me hypnotize Ashley on the stand, I know she would have convinced the jury. Too late. It\u0027s all over now.\n And a small, nagging voice in his mind said. Who says it\u0027s over? I don\u0027t hear the fat lady singing.\n There\u0027s nothing more I can do.\n Your client is innocent. Are you going to let her die?\n Leave me alone.\n Judge Williams\u0027s words kept echoing in his mind.\n \"You can\u0027t hypnotize her in my courtroom.\"\n And three words kept repeating themselves - \"in my courtroom.\"\n At five o\u0027clock in the morning, David made two excited, urgent phone calls. As he finished, the sun was just beginning to appear over the horizon. It\u0027s an omen, David thought. We\u0027re going to win.\n A little later, David hurried into an antiques store.\n The clerk approached him. \"May I help you, sir?\" He recognized David. \"Mr. Singer.\"\n \"I\u0027m looking for a folding Chinese screen. Do you have something like that?\"\n \"Yes, we do. We don\u0027t have any real antique screens, but-\"\n \"Let\u0027s see what you have.\"\n \"Certainly.\" He led David over to the section where there were several Chinese folding screens. The clerk pointed to the first one. \"Now, this one - \"\n \"That\u0027s fine,\" David said.\n \"Yes, sir. Where shall I send it?\"\n \"I\u0027ll take it with me.\"\n David\u0027s next stop was at a hardware store, where he bought a Swiss Army knife. Fifteen minutes later, he was walking into the lobby of the courthouse carrying the screen. He said to the guard at the desk, \"I made arrangements to interview Ashley Patterson. I have permission to use Judge Goldberg\u0027s chambers. He\u0027s not here today.\"\n The guard said, \"Yes, sir. It\u0027s all set. I\u0027ll have the defendant brought up. Dr. Salem and another man are already up there, waiting.\"\n \"Thank you.\"\n The guard watched David carry the Chinese screen into the elevator. Crazy as a loon, he thought.\n Judge Goldberg\u0027s chamber was a comfortable-looking room with a desk facing the window, a swivel chair, and near one wall a couch and several chars. Dr. Salem and another man were standing in the room when David entered.\n \"Sorry I\u0027m late,\" David said.\n Dr. Salem said, \"This is Hugh Iverson. He\u0027s the expert you asked for.\"\n The two men shook hands. \"Let\u0027s get set up fast,\" David said. \"Ashley\u0027s on her way here.\"\n He turned to Hugh Iverson and pointed to a corner of the room. \"How\u0027s that for you?\"\n \"Fine.\"\n He watched Iverson go to work. A few minutes later, the door opened and Ashley entered with a guard. \"I\u0027ll have to stay in the room,\" the guard said.\n David nodded. \"That\u0027s all right.\" He turned to Ashley. \"Sit down, please.\"\n He watched her take a seat. \"First of all, I want to tell you how terribly sorry I am about the way things went.\"\n She nodded, almost dazed.\n \"But it\u0027s not over yet. We still have a chance.\"\n She looked at him with disbelieving eyes.\n \"Ashley, I would like Dr. Salem to hypnotize you again.\"\n \"No. What\u0027s the point in - \"\n \"Do it for me. Will you?\"\n She shrugged.\n David nodded to Dr. Salem.\n Dr. Salem said to Ashley, \"We\u0027ve done this before, so you know that all you have to do is close your eyes and relax. Just relax. Feel all the muscles in your body letting go of all the tension. All you want to do is sleep. You\u0027re getting very drowsy....\"\n Ten minutes later. Dr. Salem looked at David and said, \"She\u0027s completely under.\"\n David moved toward Ashley, and his heart was pounding.\n \"I want to talk to Toni.\"\n There was no reaction.\n David raised his voice. \"Toni, I want you to come out. Do you hear me? Alette...want you both to talk tome.\"\n Silence.\n David was yelling now. \"What\u0027s the matter with you? Are you too frightened? That\u0027s what happened in the courtroom, isn\u0027t it? Did you hear what the jury said? Ashley\u0027s guilty. You were afraid to come out. You\u0027re a coward, Toni!\"\n They looked at Ashley. There was no reaction. David looked at Dr. Salem in despair. It was not going to work.\n \"Court is now in session. The Honorable Judge Tessa Williams presiding.\"\n Ashley was seated at the defendant\u0027s table next to David. David\u0027s hand was wrapped in a large bandage.\n David rose. \"May I approach the bench? Your Honor?\"\n \"You may.\"\n David walked toward the bench. Brennan followed him.\n David said, \"I would like to present new evidence to this case.\"\n \"Absolutely not,\" Brennan objected.\n Judge Williams turned to him and said, \"Let me make that decision, Mr. Brennan.\" She turned back to David.\n \"The trial is over. Your client has been convicted and-\"\n \"This concerns the insanity plea,\" David said. \"All I\u0027m asking for is ten minutes of your time.\"\n Judge Williams said angrily, \"Time doesn\u0027t mean much to you, does it, Mr. Singer? You have already wasted a great deal of everyone\u0027s time.\" She made her decision. \"All right. I hope this is the last request you\u0027ll ever be able to make in a court of law. The court is recessed for ten minutes.\"\n David and Brennan followed the judge to her chambers.\n She turned to David. \"I\u0027m giving you your ten minutes. What is it, Counselor?\"\n \"I want to show you a piece of film. Your Honor.\" Brennan said, I don\u0027t see what this has to do with - \"\n Judge Williams said to Brennan, \"I don\u0027t, either.\" She turned to David. \"You now have nine minutes.\"\n David hurried over to the door leading to the hallway and opened it. \"Come in.\"\n Hugh Iverson walked in, carrying a sixteen-millimeter projector and a portable screen. \"Where should I set it up?\"\n David pointed to a corner of the room. \"Over there.\"\n They watched as the man set up the equipment and plugged in the projector.\n \"May I pull down the shades?\" David asked.\n It was all Judge Williams could do to hold back her anger. \"Yes, you go right ahead, Mr. Singer.\" She looked at her watch. \"You have seven minutes.\"\n The projector was turned on. Judge Goldberg\u0027s chambers flickered onto the screen. David and Dr. Salem were watching Ashley, who was seated in a chair.\n On the screen, Dr. Salem said, \"She\u0027s completely under.\"\n David walked up to Ashley. \"I want to talk to Toni.... Toni, want you to come out. Do you hear me? Alette...want you both to talk to me.\"\n Silence.\n Judge Williams sat there, her face tight, watching the film.\n David was yelling now. \"What\u0027s the matter with you? Are you too frightened? That\u0027s what happened in the courtroom, isn\u0027t it? Did you hear what the jury said? Ashley\u0027s guilty. You were afraid to come out. You\u0027re a coward, Toni!\"\n Judge Williams got to her feet. \"I\u0027ve had enough of this! I\u0027ve seen this disgusting performance before. Your time is up, Mr. Singer.\"\n \"Wait,\" David said. \"You haven\u0027t - \"\n \"It\u0027s finished,\" Judge Williams told him and started for the door. Suddenly, a song began to fill the room.\n \"A penny for a spool of thread.\n A penny for a needle.\n That\u0027s the way the money goes,\n Pop! goes the weasel.\"\n Puzzled, Judge Williams turned around. She looked at the picture on the screen.\n Ashley\u0027s face had completely changed. It was Toni. Toni said angrily, \"Too frightened to come out in court? Did you really think I would come out just because you ordered me to? What do you think I am, a trained pony?\"\n Judge Williams slowly moved back into the room, staring at the film.\n \"I listened to all those bloody gits making fools of themselves.\" She mimicked one of their voices. \" \u0027I don\u0027t think that multiple personality disorder exists.\u0027 What idiots. I\u0027ve never seen such - \"\n As they watched, Ashley\u0027s face changed again. She seemed to relax in her chair, and her face took on a shy look. In her Italian accent, Alette said, \"Mr. Singer, know you did the best you could. I wanted to appear in court and help you, but Toni wouldn\u0027t let me.\" Judge Williams was watching, her face blank. The face and voice changed again. \"You\u0027re bleeding right wouldn\u0027t,\" Toni said.\n David said, \"Toni, what do you think is going to happen to you if the judge gives Ashley the death sentence?\"\n \"She\u0027s not going to give her the death sentence. Ashley didn\u0027t even know one of the men. Remember?\"\n David said, \"But Alette knew them all. You committed those murders, Alette. You had sex with those men and then you stabbed them to death and castrated them....\"\n Toni said, \"You bloody idiot! You don\u0027t know anything, do you? Alette would never have had the nerve to do that. I did it. They deserved to die. All they wanted to do was have sex.\" She was breathing hard. \"But I made them all pay for it, didn\u0027t I? And no one can ever prove I did it. Let little Miss Goody Two-shoes take the blame. We\u0027ll all go to a nice cozy asylum and - \"\n In the background, behind the Chinese screen in the corner, there was a loud click.\n Toni turned. \"What was that?\"\n \"Nothing,\" David said quickly. \"It was just - \"\n Toni rose and started running toward the camera until her face filled the screen. She pushed against something, and the scene tilled; part of the folding Chinese screen fell into the picture. A small hole had been cut in the center.\n \"You\u0027ve got a fucking camera behind here,\" Toni screamed. She turned to David. \"You son of a bitch, what are you trying to do? You tricked me!\"\n On the desk was a letter opener. Toni grabbed it and lunged at David, screaming, \"I\u0027m going to kill you. I\u0027m going to kill you!\"\n David tried to hold her, but he was no match for her. The letter opener sliced into his hand.\n Toni raised her arm to strike again, and the guard ran to her and tried to grab her. Toni knocked him to the floor. The door opened and a uniformed officer ran in. When he saw what was happening, he lunged at Toni. She kicked him in the groin, and he went down. Two more officers came running in. It took three of them to pin Toni to the chair, and all the time she was yelling and screaming at them.\n Blood was pouring from David\u0027s hand. He said to Dr. Salem, \"For God\u0027s sake, wake her up.\"\n Dr. Salem said, \"Ashley... Ashley... listen to me. You\u0027re going to come out now. Toni is gone. It\u0027s safe to come out now, Ashley. I\u0027m going to count to three.\"\n And as the group watched, Ashley\u0027s body became quiet and relaxed.\n \"Can you hear me?\"\n \"Yes.\" It was Ashley\u0027s voice, sounding far away.\n \"You\u0027ll awaken at the count of three. One... two... three... How do you feel?\"\n Her eyes opened. \"I feel so tired. Did I say anything?\"\n The screen in Judge Williams\u0027 s office went blank. David walked over to the wall and turned on the lights.\n Brennan said, \"Well! What a performance. If they were giving out Oscars for the best - \"\n Judge Williams turned to him. \"Shut up.\" Brennan looked at her, in shock. There was a momentary silence. Judge Williams turned to David. \"Counselor.\"\n \"Yes?\" There was a pause. \"I owe you an apology.\"\n Seated on the bench, Judge Tessa Williams said, \"Both counsels have agreed that they will accept the opinion of a psychiatrist who has already examined the defendant, Dr. Salem. The decision of this court is that the defendant is not guilty by reason of insanity. She will be ordered to a mental health facility, where she can be treated. The court is now adjourned.\u0027\n David stood up, drained. It\u0027s over, he thought. It\u0027s finally over. He and Sandra could start living their lives again.\n He looked at Judge Williams and said happily, \"We\u0027re having a baby.\"\n Dr. Salem said to David, \"I would like to make a suggestion. I\u0027m not sure it can be done, but if you can arrange it, I think it would be helpful to Ashley.\"\n \"What is it?\"\n \"The Connecticut Psychiatric Hospital back east has handled more cases of MPD than any other place in the country. A friend of mine, Dr. Otto Lewison, is in charge of it. If you could arrange for the court to have Ashley sent there, I think it would be very beneficial.\"\n \"Thanks,\" David said. \"I\u0027ll see what I can do.\"\n Dr. Steven Patterson said to David, \"I - I don\u0027t know how to thank you.\"\n David smiled. \"You don\u0027t have to. It was quid pro quo. Remember?\"\n \"You did a brilliant job. For a while I was afraid - \"\n \"So was I.\"\n \"But justice has been served. My daughter\u0027s going to be cured.\"\n \"I\u0027m sure of it,\" David said. \"Dr. Salem suggested a psychiatric hospital in Connecticut. Their doctors are trained in MPD.\"\n Dr. Patterson was silent for a moment. \"You know, Ashley didn\u0027t deserve any of this. She\u0027s such a beautiful person.\"\n \"I agree. I\u0027ll talk to Judge Williams and try to get the transfer.\"\n Judge Williams was in her chambers. \"What can I do for you, Mr. Singer?\"\n \"I\u0027d like to ask a favor.\" She smiled. \"I hope I can grant it. What is it?\" David explained to the judge what Dr. Salem had told him.\n \"Well, that\u0027s a rather unusual request. We have some fine psychiatric facilities right here in California.\"\n David said, \"All right. Thank you. Your Honor.\" He turned to leave, disappointed.\n \"I haven\u0027t said no, Mr. Singer.\" David stopped. \"It\u0027s an unusual request, but this has been an unusual case.\" David waited.\n \"I think I can arrange for her to be transferred.\"\n \"Thank you. Your Honor. I appreciate it.\"\n In her cell, Ashley thought. They\u0027ve sentenced me to death. A long death in an asylum filled with crazy people. It would have been kinder to kill me now. She thought of the endless, hopeless years ahead of her, and she began to sob.\n The cell door opened, and her father came in. He stood there a moment, looking at her, his face filled with anguish.\n \"Honey...\" He sat down opposite her. \"You\u0027re going to live,\" he said.\n She shook her head. \"I don\u0027t want to live.\"\n \"Don\u0027t say that. You have a medical problem, but it can be cured. And it\u0027s going to be. When you\u0027re better, you\u0027re going to come and live with me, and I\u0027ll take care of you. No matter what happens, we\u0027ll always have each other. They can\u0027t take that away from us.\"\n Ashley sat there, saying nothing.\n \"I know how you\u0027re feeling right now, but believe me, that\u0027s going to change. My girl is going to come home to me, cured.\" He slowly got to his feet \"I\u0027m afraid I have to get back to San Francisco.\" He waited for Ashley to say something.\n She was silent.\n \"David told me that he thinks you\u0027re going to be sent to one of the best psychiatric centers in the world. I\u0027ll come and visit you. Would you like that?\"\n She nodded, dully. \"Yes.\"\n \"All right, honey.\" He kissed her on the cheek and gave her a hug. \"I\u0027m going to see to it that you have the best care in the world. I want my little girl back.\"\n Ashley watched her father leave, and she thought, Why can\u0027t I die now? Why won\u0027t they let me die? One hour later, David came to see her. \"Well, we did it,\" he said. He looked at her in concern. \"Are you all right?\"\n \"I don\u0027t want to go to an insane asylum. I want to die. I can\u0027t stand living like this. Help me, David. Please help me.\"\n \"Ashley, you\u0027re going to get help. The past is over. You have a future now. The nightmare is going to be finished.\" He took her hand. \"Look, you\u0027ve trusted me this far. Keep trusting me. You\u0027re going to live a normal life again.\"\n She sat there, silent.\n \"Say \u0027I believe you, David.\u0027 \"\n She took a deep breath. \"I - I believe you, David.\"\n He grinned. \"Good girl. This is a new beginning for you.\"\n The moment the ruling was made public, the media went crazy. Overnight, David was a hero. He had taken an impossible case and won it. He called Sandra. \"Honey, I - \"\n \"I know, darling. I know. I just saw it on television. Isn\u0027t it wonderful? I\u0027m so proud of you.\"\n \"I can\u0027t tell you how glad I am that it\u0027s over. I\u0027ll be coming back tonight. I can\u0027t wait to see - \"\n \"David...?\"\n \"Yes?\"\n \"David... oooh...\"\n \"Yes? What\u0027s wrong, honey?\"\n \"... Oooh... We\u0027re having a baby....\"\n \"Wait for me!\" David shouted.\n Jeffrey Singer weighed eight pounds, ten ounces, and was the most beautiful baby David had ever seen.\n \"He looks just like you, David,\" Sandra said.\n \"He does, doesn\u0027t he?\" David beamed.\n \"I\u0027m glad everything turned out so well,\" Sandra said.\n David sighed. \"There were times when I wasn\u0027t so sure\".\n \"I never doubted you.\"\n David bugged Sandra and said, \"I\u0027ll be back, honey. I have to clean out my things at the office.\"\n When David arrived at the offices of Kincaid, Turner, Rose \u0026 Ripley, he was greeted warmly.\n \"Congratulations, David...\"\n \"Good job...\"\n \"You really showed them....\"\n David walked into his office. Holly was gone. David started cleaning out his desk.\n \"David - \"\n David turned around. It was Joseph Kincaid.\n Kincaid walked up to him and said, \"What are you doing?\"\n \"I\u0027m cleaning out my office. I was fired.\"\n Kincaid smiled. \"Fired? Of course not No, no, no. There was some kind of a misunderstanding.\" He beamed. \"We\u0027re making you a partner, my boy. In fact, I\u0027ve set up a press conference for you here this afternoon at three o\u0027clock.\"\n David looked at him. \"Really?\"\n Kincaid nodded. \"Absolutely.\"\n David said, \"You\u0027d better cancel it. I\u0027ve decided to go back into criminal law. I\u0027ve been offered a partnership by Jesse Quiller. At least when you\u0027re dealing with that part of the law, you know who the criminals really are. So, Joey, baby, you take your partnership and shove it where the sun don\u0027t shine.\"\n And David walked out of the office.\n * * *\n Jesse Quiller looked around the penthouse and said, \"This is great. It really becomes you two.\"\n \"Thank you,\" Sandra said. She heard a sound from the nursery. \"I\u0027d better check on Jeffrey.\" She hurried off to the next room.\n Jesse Quiller walked over to admire a beautiful sterling silver picture frame with Jeffrey\u0027s first photograph already in it. \"This is lovely. Where did it come from?\"\n \"Judge Williams sent it\"\n Jesse said, \"I\u0027m glad to have you back, partner.\"\n \"I\u0027m glad to be back, Jesse.\"\n \"You\u0027ll probably want a little time to relax now. Rest up a little....\"\n \"Yes. We thought we\u0027d take Jeffrey and drive up Oregon to visit Sandra\u0027s parents and - \"\n \"By the way, an interesting case came into the of this morning, David. This woman is accused of murdering her two children. I have a feeling she\u0027s innocent.
