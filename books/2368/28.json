I\u0027m Dr. Montfort, and I need to ask you some questions. How do you feel about yourself?\" \"I feel wonderful, Doctor. It\u0027s as though I\u0027ve just gotten over a long illness.\" \"Do you think you\u0027re a bad person?\" \"No. I know some bad things have happened, but I don\u0027t believe I\u0027m responsible for them.\" \"Do you hate anyone?\" \"No.\" \"What about your father? Do you hate him?\" \"I did. I don\u0027t hate him anymore. I don\u0027t think he could help what he did. I just hope he\u0027s all right now.\" \"Would you like to see him again?\" \"I think it would be better if I didn\u0027t. He has his life. I want to start a new life for myself.\" \"Ashley?\" \"Yes.\" \"I\u0027m Dr. Vaughn. I\u0027d like to have a little chat with you.\" \"All right.\" \"Do you remember Toni and Alette?\" \"Of course. But they\u0027re gone.\" \"How do you feel about them?\" \"In the beginning, I was terrified, but now I know I needed them. I\u0027m grateful to them.\" \"Do you sleep well at night?\" \"Now I do, yes.\" \"Tell Me Your Dreams.\" \"I used to have terrible dreams; something was always chasing me. I thought I was going to be murdered.\" \"Do you still have those dreams?\" \"Not anymore. My dreams are very peaceful. I see bright colors and smiling people. Last night, I dreamed I was at a ski resort, flying down the slopes. It was wonderful. I don\u0027t mind cold weather at all anymore.\" \"How do you feel about your father?\" \"I want him to be happy, and I want to be happy.\" \"Ashley?\" \"Yes.\" \"I\u0027m Dr. Hoelterhoff.\" \"How do you do, Doctor?\" \"They didn\u0027t tell me how beautiful you were. Do you think you\u0027re beautiful?\" \"I think I\u0027m attractive....\" \"I hear that you have a lovely voice. Do you think you do?\" \"It\u0027s not a trained voice, but, yes\" - she laughed - \"I do manage to sing on key.\" \"And they tell me you paint. Are you good?\" \"For an amateur, I think I\u0027m quite good. Yes.\" He was studying her thoughtfully. \"Do you have any problems that you would like to discuss with me?\" \"I can\u0027t think of any. I\u0027m treated very well here.\" \"How do you feel about leaving here and getting out into the world?\" \"I\u0027ve thought a lot about it. It\u0027s scary, but at the same time it\u0027s exciting.\" \"Do you think you would be afraid out there?\" \"No. I want to build a new life. I\u0027m good with computers. I can\u0027t go back to the company I worked for, but I\u0027m sure I can get a job at another company.\" Dr. Hoelterhoff nodded. \"Thank you, Ashley. It was a pleasure talking to you.\" Dr. Montfort, Dr. Vaughn, Dr. Hoelterhoff and Dr. Keller were gathered in Otto Lewison\u0027s office. He was studying their reports. When he finished, he looked up at Dr. Keller and smiled. \"Congratulations,\" he said. \"These reports are all positive. You\u0027ve done a wonderful job.\" \"She\u0027s a wonderful woman. Very special, Otto. I\u0027m glad she\u0027s going to have her life back again.\" \"Has she agreed to outpatient treatment when she leaves here?\" \"Absolutely.\" Otto Lewison nodded. \"Very well. I\u0027ll have the release papers drawn up.\" He turned to the other doctors. \"Thank you, gentlemen. I appreciate your help.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tell-me-your-dreams/page-28.html","bookId":2368,"book":{"id":2368,"title":"Tell Me Your Dreams","description":"Storyline: Computer whiz Ashley Patterson is convinced she is being stalked.
