Though haunted by the recent deaths of two teammates, Jackson Crow knows that the living commit the most heinous crimes. A police officer utilizing her paranormal intuition, Angela Hawkins already has her hands full of mystery and bloodshed. But one assignment calls to them too strongly to resist. In a historic mansion in New Orleans\u0027s French Quarter, a senator\u0027s wife falls to her death. Most think she jumped; some say she was pushed. And yet others believe she was beckoned by the ghostly spirits inhabiting the house â€” once the site of a serial killer\u0027s grisly work. In this seemingly unsolvable case, only one thing is certain: whether supernatural or all too human, crimes of passion will cast Jackson and Angela into danger of losing their lives... and their immortal souls.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/phantom-evil-krewe-of-hunters-1.jpg","author":"Heather Graham","type":"Mystery","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":55,"category":{"id":19,"name":"Mystery","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
