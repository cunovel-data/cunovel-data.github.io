Now,” she replied, keeping her voice low, breathy and urgent.\\n\\n DuPre backed away farther. Jackson rose, catching her hand and drawing her up against him. “What’s he doing now?” he whispered, nuzzling his forehead against hers while they stood in the body crunch.\\n\\n “Still staring,” Angela whispered.\\n\\n “I knew you would love this place. Beauty is beauty, and movement, well…” Jackson purred. “Yes.”\\n\\n “I’m burning up,” Jackson said.\\n\\n She kept her voice low, and very dry. “Yep. I’m just a hunk, a hunk of burning love.”\\n\\n His smile then was real, even as he asked again, “He’s still watching?”\\n\\n “Yes?”\\n\\n He nuzzled her impossibly close, and kissed her. It wasn’t a stage kiss. It was a full, passionate, filled-with-tongue kiss, and despite herself, she was swept away by it, forgetting their real mission, and simply luxuriating in the rampant wall of heat provided by the muscled hardness of his chest and the lava-flow sweetness of his kiss. She closed her eyes, stunned and seduced in one, and feeling a tidal wave of arousal sweep over her, something that the eroticism of the most accomplished dancer couldn’t begin to create.\\n\\n He broke the kiss, his lips a bare half inch away.\\n\\n “Is he still there?”\\n\\n “What?”\\n\\n “DuPre.”\\n\\n “Oh!” She almost jerked away, but she held her ground. She brushed her lips against his teasingly, whispering all the while. “No. He’s gone back to his chair. I think he’s still looking.”\\n\\n “All right, then. I think we’ll notice him.”\\n\\n He pulled around to his side; they were ready to leave. But as he did so, he looked out to the tables closer to the stage.\\n\\n “DuPre,” he said, not loudly. He lifted a hand to wave.\\n\\n DuPre lifted a hand as well. He stood, walking away from the group to join them. Onstage, a new girl—Angela was pretty sure she had been announced as Cherry Candy—was winding lithely around the pole.\\n\\n Martin DuPre looked at the two of them as if seeing them for the first time. He grinned wryly. “Wow. Imagine the two of you here. I didn’t even know you were a couple.”\\n\\n Jackson laughed, pulling her close. “There’s nothing against fraternizing on our team, we’re really kind of a special unit.”\\n\\n “Yeah, ghost busters,” DuPre snorted.\\n\\n “Imagine you here,” Angela said.\\n\\n “Part of the job, I’m afraid,” he said. “David Holloway is kind of a loner, a family man, but to most people, this is good clean fun. Oil guys,” he said, indicating the three men at his table. “They don’t get out that much… They’re just having fun.” He looked at the two of them, with another smile. He was convinced his story was totally plausible, but then he seemed to think that theirs was, too.\\n\\n “Sorry, still can’t imagine the two of you here,” DuPre said.\\n\\n Jackson pulled her closer. “Well, this one, she’s a wicked little hellion when she wants to be. It just increases all the good stuff when you get home, huh, honey?”\\n\\n She kept her smile in place, staring at DuPre, and feeling like a fool.\\n\\n “It helps Jackson along a lot, you know—keeping things going, and sometimes, you know, a working guy can be just a little worn-out,” she said sweetly. She felt Jackson tense, though there wasn’t a single change in his face.\\n\\n “What can I say?” he asked. “She’s insatiable.”\\n\\n “Wow,” DuPre said, looking at her. Her arm was around Jackson’s waist, his was around her shoulder. She gave his midriff a solid pinch. He flinched, but again gave no sign.\\n\\n “I have to take her to the S and M clubs sometimes, you know?” Jackson said.\\n\\n “Wow,” DuPre repeated, looking at her with new appreciation.\\n\\n “And we’ve just got to get home now—honey,” she said to Jackson.\\n\\n “Yes, we do,” Jackson agreed. “Seize the moment,” he told DuPre.\\n\\n “Well, good to see you two out and about and enjoying the city. Good night,” DuPre said.\\n\\n “Good night!” Angela said cheerfully. Jackson waved.\\n\\n And finally, they were out, and back on Bourbon Street where the bars remained crowded, the music was cacophony and life seemed to scream out loud.\\n\\n Angela pulled away from Jackson and glared at him. “An S and M club?” she demanded.\\n\\n “Hey! You implied that I was impotent!”\\n\\n “You made me out to be an animal,” she said.\\n\\n “Technically, we’re all animals,” he reminded her.\\n\\n “Oh!” She stared at him with aggravation and started walking. “Hey, I think it’s better to be a wildcat than a limp rag!” he said, humor in his voice as he walked after her.\\n\\n She turned back, not sure what she was going to say, but it was going to be fierce. But she saw the amusement in his eyes. He lifted his hands. “Hey, it’s all in a day’s work,” he said lightly.\\n\\n She burst out laughing. His smile deepened; she waited and he stepped forward to start walking with her again.\\n\\n “And quite a day’s work,” Angela said. “You know, I’m worried. There has to be a reason that Gabby was so terrified of me saying anything to anyone. She didn’t want me to tell anyone at all that I met her. But she’s going home. What if she is in danger? I doubt if her parents are prepared to protect her if someone really lethal is out there.”\\n\\n “You have her full name and address?” he asked.\\n\\n “Yes, I made sure I gave the cabdriver the money and her address,” Angela assured him.\\n\\n “Let’s get back to the house. I’ll put a call through to Andy Devereaux and see if he can, at the very least, make sure that a patrol car keeps a close watch on the place.”\\n\\n She nodded. They kept walking. Close. When a staggering group would walk by, Jackson either caught her by the shoulders or slipped an arm around her, drawing her close—and away from a potential human gridlock.\\n\\n When they reached the house, Whitney was there to open the front door. “You’re not going to believe what happened tonight!” she said excitedly.\\n\\n “What?” Jackson asked tersely. “Was there something that happened at the Church of Christ Arisen?”\\n\\n “No,” Whitney said.\\n\\n “Not unless you count Whitney singing every Beatles song known to man as something happening,” Will said, coming up behind her. “Nothing. Door didn’t open or close for three hours. We came on back.”\\n\\n “Then what?” Angela asked.\\n\\n Jake and Jenna had been seated in front of the screens, all rolling real time in the house. They were twisted around now, watching the others at the door.\\n\\n “Guess who was at the Aryans meeting?” Jake asked.\\n\\n “Blake Conroy,” Jackson replied.\\n\\n “Wow, how did he know that?” Jake asked, staring at Jenna.\\n\\n “Process of elimination,” Jackson said dryly. “We were watching Martin DuPre. I saw Grable Haines lounging by the car about a block down from the restaurant. He didn’t look like a happy camper, but bored as he might have been, I don’t think he went anywhere else.”\\n\\n “Was the car still there when we left?” Angela asked him. She felt absurdly guilty; she hadn’t even looked.\\n\\n Jackson nodded. “I’m imagining that Haines had orders to stay put until Martin DuPre called him. So, our friend Blake Conroy was at the Aryans meeting. Interesting. Did he see you? Did you speak with him?”\\n\\n “We did,” Jenna said.\\n\\n “Jenna nearly caused us to be lynched first,” Jake supplied.\\n\\n “I did not!”\\n\\n “If comments like ‘these are the most racist assholes I’ve ever seen’ aren’t inflammatory at such a gathering, I’m not sure what would be,” Jake said.\\n\\n “No one heard me but you,” Jenna dismissed his remark with a shrug.\\n\\n “So what did Blake Conroy have to say for himself?” Jackson asked.\\n\\n “He said that he had come to see what was going on so that he could warn the senator,” Jake said.\\n\\n “And what did you think about that?” Jackson asked.\\n\\n “It was hard to tell if he was lying or not,” Jenna said.\\n\\n “Come on—you can read people. What did you feel?” Jackson asked.\\n\\n “I honestly didn’t know,” Jenna said. “He walked right up to us, and it looked as if he was feeling the same way. As if he’d read my mind.”\\n\\n “Do you mean that you think he has some kind of telepathic ability?” Jake asked.\\n\\n “I’d say he can really read people, and because of it, he’s probably really good at manipulating them,” Jenna said.\\n\\n Jackson nodded. “Excuse me, I have to make a call to Andy Devereaux. Angela, why don’t you fill them in on our evening. I think we have the trump card tonight,” he said casually, and left them, pulling his phone out as he bounded up the stairs.\\n\\n They all stared at Angela, waiting. “Well, it was…interesting,” she said. And she told them about Martin DuPre and his group at dinner, and how she went after Gabby Taylor, what she learned from the girl, and that Martin DuPre had taken his business pals down to the strip club for lap dances. Both Jenna and Whitney found the latter amusing, and wanted to know if she had enjoyed a lap dance, too.\\n\\n “Hey, hey. Business here,” she said. “I’m worried about Gabby, but Jackson is calling Andy now to see to it that a patrol car drives around her house.”\\n\\n “I don’t understand—shouldn’t someone let the senator know right away that his right-hand man is practically a pedophile?” Jake asked.\\n\\n “Jackson wants to lie low for a while.”\\n\\n “Because none of them are what they seem—and they all have the wool totally pulled over the eye of the public—the voters!” Jake said. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/phantom-evil-krewe-of-hunters-1/page-35.html","bookId":2275,"book":{"id":2275,"title":"Phantom Evil (Krewe of Hunters #1)","description":"Storyline: Phantom Evil (Krewe of Hunters #1) \\n A secret government unit, a group of renegade paranormal investigators... and a murder no one else can crack. \\n Though haunted by the recent deaths of two teammates, Jackson Crow knows that the living commit the most heinous crimes. \\n A police officer utilizing her paranormal intuition, Angela Hawkins already has her hands full of mystery and bloodshed. \\n But one assignment calls to them too strongly to resist.
