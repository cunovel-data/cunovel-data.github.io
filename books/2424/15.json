{"id":77359,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"Le Chiffre nodded to the thin man who quietly left the room and closed the door.\\n\\n There was a packet of Gauloises on the table and a lighter. Le Chiffre lit a cigarette and swallowed a mouthful of coffee from the glass. Then he picked up the cane carpet-beater and, resting the handle comfortably on his knee, allowed the flat trefoil base to lie on the floor directly under Bond\u0027s chair.\\n\\n He looked Bond carefully, almost caressingly, in the eyes. Then his wrists sprang suddenly upwards on his knee.\\n\\n The result was startling.\\n\\n Bond\u0027s whole body arched in an involuntary spasm. His face contracted in a soundless scream and his lips drew right away from his teeth. At the same time his head flew back with a jerk showing the taut sinews of his neck. For an instant, muscles stood out in knots all over his body and his toes and fingers clenched until they were quite white. Then his body sagged and perspiration started to bead all over his body. He uttered a deep groan.\\n\\n Le Chiffre waited for his eyes to open.\\n\\n \u0027You see, dear boy?\u0027 He smiled a soft, fat smile. \u0027Is the position quite clear now?\u0027\\n\\n A drop of sweat fell off Bond\u0027s chin on to his naked chest.\\n\\n \u0027Now let us get down to business and see how soon we can be finished with this unfortunate mess you have got yourself into.\u0027 He puffed cheerfully at his cigarette and gave an admonitory tap on the floor beneath Bond\u0027s chair with his horrible and incongruous instrument.\\n\\n \u0027My dear boy,\u0027 Le Chiffre spoke like a father, \u0027the game of Red Indians is over, quite over. You have stumbled by mischance into a game for grown-ups and you have already found it a painful experience. You are not equipped, my dear boy, to play games with adults and it was very foolish of your nanny in London to have sent you out here with your spade and bucket. Very foolish indeed and most unfortunate for you.\\n\\n \u0027But we must stop joking, my dear fellow, although I am sure you would like to follow me in developing this amusing little cautionary tale.\u0027\\n\\n He suddenly dropped his bantering tone and looked at Bond sharply and venomously.\\n\\n \u0027Where is the money?\u0027\\n\\n Bond\u0027s bloodshot eyes looked emptily back at him.\\n\\n Again the upward jerk of the wrist and again Bond\u0027s whole body writhed and contorted.\\n\\n Le Chiffre waited until the tortured heart eased down its laboured pumping and until Bond\u0027s eyes dully opened again.\\n\\n \u0027Perhaps I should explain,\u0027 said Le Chiffre. \u0027I intend to continue attacking the sensitive parts of your body until you answer my question. I am without mercy and there will be no relenting. There is no one to stage a last-minute rescue and there is no possibility of escape for you. This is not a romantic adventure story in which the villain is finally routed and the hero is given a medal and marries the girl. Unfortunately these things don\u0027t happen in real life. If you continue to be obstinate, you will be tortured to the edge of madness and then the girl will be brought in and we will set about her in front of you. If that is still not enough, you will both be painfully killed and I shall reluctantly leave your bodies and make my way abroad to a comfortable house which is waiting for me. There I shall take up a useful and profitable career and live to a ripe and peaceful old age in the bosom of the family I shall doubtless create. So you see, my dear boy, that I stand to lose nothing. If you hand the money over, so much the better. If not, I shall shrug my shoulders and be on my way.\u0027\\n\\n He paused, and his wrist lifted slightly on his knee. Bond\u0027s flesh cringed as the cane surface just touched him.\\n\\n \u0027But you, my dear fellow, can only hope that I shall spare you further pain and spare your life. There is no other hope for you but that. Absolutely none.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well?\u0027\\n\\n Bond closed his eyes and waited for the pain. He knew that the beginning of torture is the worst. There is a parabola of agony. A crescendo leading up to a peak and then the nerves are blunted and react progressively less until unconsciousness and death. All he could do was to pray for the peak, pray that his spirit would hold out so long and then accept the long free-wheel down to the final black-out.\\n\\n He had been told by colleagues who had survived torture by the Germans and the Japanese that towards the end there came a wonderful period of warmth and languor leading into a sort of sexual twilight where pain turned to pleasure and where hatred and fear of the torturers turned to a masochistic infatuation. It was the supreme test of will, he had learnt, to avoid showing this form of punch-drunkenness. Directly it was suspected they would either kill you at once and save themselves further useless effort, or let you recover sufficiently your nerves had crept back to the other side of the parabola. Then they would start again.\\n\\n He opened his eyes a fraction.\\n\\n Le Chiffre had been waiting for this and like a rattlesnake the cane instrument leapt from the floor. It struck again and again so that Bond screamed and his body jangled in the chair like a marionette.\\n\\n Le Chiffre desisted only when Bond\u0027s tortured spasms showed a trace of sluggishness. He sat for a while sipping his coffee and frowning slightly like a surgeon watching a cardiograph during a difficult operation.\\n\\n When Bond\u0027s eyes flickered and opened he addressed him again, but now with a trace of impatience.\\n\\n \u0027We know that the money is somewhere in your room,\u0027 he said. \u0027You drew a cheque to cash for forty million francs and I know that you went back to the hotel to hide it.\u0027\\n\\n For a moment Bond wondered how he had been so certain.\\n\\n \u0027Directly you left for the night club,\u0027 continued Le Chiffre, \u0027your room was searched by four of my people.\u0027\\n\\n The Muntzes must have helped, reflected Bond.\\n\\n \u0027We found a good deal in childish hiding-places. The ball-cock in the lavatory yielded an interesting little code-book and we found some more of your papers taped to the back of a drawer. All the furniture has been taken to pieces and your clothes and the curtains and bedclothes have been cut up. Every inch of the room has been searched and all the fittings removed. It is most unfortunate for you that we didn\u0027t find the cheque. If we had, you would now be comfortably in bed, perhaps with the beautiful Miss Lynd, instead of this.\u0027 He lashed upwards.\\n\\n Through the red mist of pain, Bond thought of Vesper. He could imagine how she was being used by the two gunmen. They would be making the most of her before she was sent for by Le Chiffre. He thought of the fat wet lips of the Corsican and the slow cruelty of the thin man. Poor wretch to have been dragged into this. Poor little beast.\\n\\n Le Chiffre was talking again.\\n\\n \u0027Torture is a terrible thing,\u0027 he was saying as he puffed at a fresh cigarette, \u0027but it is a simple matter for the torturer, particularly when the patient,\u0027 he smiled at the word, \u0027is a man. You see, my dear Bond, with a man it is quite unnecessary to indulge in refinements. With this simple instrument, or with almost any other object, one can cause a man as much pain as is possible or necessary. Do not believe what you read in novels or books about the war. There is nothing worse. It is not only the immediate agony, but also the thought that your manhood is being gradually destroyed and that at the end, if you will not yield, you will no longer be a man.\\n\\n \u0027That, my dear Bond, is a sad and terrible thought - a long chain of agony for the body and also for the mind, and then the final screaming moment when you will beg me to kill you. All that is inevitable unless you tell me where you hid the money.\u0027\\n\\n He poured some more coffee into the glass and drank it down leaving brown corners to his mouth.\\n\\n Bond\u0027s lips were writhing. He was trying to say something. At last he got the word out in a harsh croak: \u0027Drink,\u0027 he said and his tongue came out and swilled across his dry lips.\\n\\n \u0027Of course, my dear boy, how thoughtless of me.\u0027 Le Chiffre poured some coffee into the other glass. There was a ring of sweat drops on the floor round Bond\u0027s chair.\\n\\n \u0027We must certainly keep your tongue lubricated.\u0027\\n\\n He laid the handle of the carpet-beater down on the floor between his thick legs and rose from his chair. He went behind Bond and taking a handful of his soaking hair in one hand, he wrenched Bond\u0027s head sharply back. He poured the coffee down Bond\u0027s throat in small mouthfuls so that he would not choke. Then he released his head so that it fell forward again on his chest. He went back to his chair and picked up the carpet-beater.\\n\\n Bond raised his head and spoke thickly.\\n\\n \u0027Money no good to you.\u0027 His voice was a laborious croak. \u0027Police trace it to you.\u0027\\n\\n Exhausted by the effort, his head sank forward again. He was a little, but only a little, exaggerating the extent of his physical collapse. Anything to gain time and anything to defer the next searing pain.\\n\\n \u0027Ah, my dear fellow, I had forgotten to tell you.\u0027 Le Chiffre smiled wolfishly. \u0027We met after our little game at the Casino and you were such a sportsman that you agreed we would have one more run through the pack between the two of us. It was a gallant gesture. Typical of an English gentleman.\\n\\n \u0027Unfortunately you lost and this upset you so much that you decided to leave Royale immediately for an unknown destination. Like the gentleman you are, you very kindly gave me a note explaining the circumstances so that I would have no difficulty in cashing your cheque. You see, dear boy, everything has been thought of and you need have no fears on my account.\u0027 He chuckled fatly.\\n\\n \u0027Now shall we continue? I have all the time in the world and truth to tell I am rather interested to see how long a man can stand this particular form of . . . er . . . encouragement.\u0027 He rattled the harsh cane on the floor.\\n\\n So that was the score, thought Bond, with a final sinking of the heart. The \u0027unknown destination\u0027 would be under the ground or under the sea, or perhaps, more simply, under the crashed Bentley. Well, if he had to die anyway, he might as well try it the hard way. He had no hope that Mathis or Leiter would get to him in time, but at least there was a chance that they would catch up with Le Chiffre before he could get away. It must be getting on for seven. The car might have been found by now. It was a choice of evils, but the longer Le Chiffre continued the torture the more likely he would be revenged.\\n\\n Bond lifted his head and looked Le Chiffre in the eyes.\\n\\n The china of the whites was now veined with red. It was like looking at two blackcurrants poached in blood. The rest of the wide face was yellowish except where a thick black stubble covered the moist skin. The upward edges of black coffee at the corners of the mouth gave his expression a false smile and the whole face was faintly striped by the light through the Venetian blinds.\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 he said flatly, \u0027. . . you . . .\u0027\\n\\n Le Chiffre grunted and set to work again with savage fury. Occasionally he snarled like a wild beast.\\n\\n After ten minutes Bond had fainted, blessedly.\\n\\n Le Chiffre at once stopped. He wiped some sweat from his face with a circular motion of his disengaged hand. Then he looked at his watch and seemed to make up his mind.\\n\\n He got up and stood behind the inert, dripping body. There was no colour in Bond\u0027s face or anywhere on his body above the waist. There was a faint flutter of his skin above the heart. Otherwise he might have been dead.\\n\\n Le Chiffre seized Bond\u0027s ears and harshly twisted them. Then he leant forward and slapped his cheeks hard several times. Bond\u0027s head rolled from side to side with each blow. Slowly his breathing became deeper. An animal groan came from his lolling mouth.\\n\\n Le Chiffre took a glass of coffee and poured some into Bond\u0027s mouth and threw the rest in his face. Bond\u0027s eyes slowly opened.\\n\\n Le Chiffre returned to his chair and waited. He lit a cigarette and contemplated the spattered pool of blood on the floor beneath the inert body opposite. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/casino-royale-james-bond-1/page-15.html","bookId":2424,"book":{"id":2424,"title":"Casino Royale (James Bond #1)","description":"Storyline: Casino Royale (James Bond (Original Series) #1) \\n In the first of Ian Fleming\u0027s James Bond novels, 007 declares war on Le Chiffre, French communist and paymaster of the Soviet murder organization SMERSH. \\n The battle begins with a fifty-million-franc game of baccarat, gains momentum during Bond\u0027s fiery love affair with a sensuous lady spy, and reaches a chilling climax with fiendish torture at the hands of a master sadist.
