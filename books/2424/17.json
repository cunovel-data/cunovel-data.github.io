{"id":77361,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"\u0027About an hour,\u0027 said Bond.\n \u0027Then it is remarkable that you are alive and I congratulate you. Few men could have supported what you have been through. Perhaps that is some consolation. As Monsieur Mathis can tell you, I have had in my time to treat a number of patients who have suffered similar and not one has come through it as you have done.\u0027\n The doctor looked at Bond for a moment and then turned brusquely to Mathis.\n \u0027You may have ten minutes and then you will be forcibly elected. If you put the patient\u0027s temperature up, you will answer for it.\u0027\n He gave them both a broad smile and left the room.\n Mathis came over and took the doctor\u0027s chair.\n \u0027That\u0027s a good man,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027I like him.\u0027\n \u0027He\u0027s attached to the Bureau,\u0027 said Mathis. \u0027He is a very good man and I will tell you about him one of these days. He thinks you are a prodigy - and so do I.\n \u0027However, that can wait. As you can imagine, there is much to clear up and I am being pestered by Paris and, of course, London, and even by Washington via our good friend Leiter. Incidentally,\u0027 he broke off, \u0027I have a personal message from M. He spoke to me himself on the telephone. He simply said to tell you that he is much impressed. I asked if that was all and he said: “Well, tell him that the Treasury is greatly relieved.” Then he rang off.\u0027\n Bond grinned with pleasure. What most warmed him was that M himself should have rung up Mathis. This was quite unheard of. The very existence of M, let alone his identity, was never admitted. He could imagine the flutter this must have caused in the ultra-security-minded organization in London.\n \u0027A tall thin man with one arm came over from London the same day we found you,\u0027 continued Mathis, knowing from his own experience that these shop details would interest Bond more than anything else and give him most pleasure, \u0027and he fixed up the nurses and looked after everything. Even your car\u0027s being repaired for you. He seemed to be Vesper\u0027s boss. He spent a lot of time with her and gave her strict instructions to look after you.\u0027\n Head of S, thought Bond. They\u0027re certainly giving me the red carpet treatment.\n \u0027Now,\u0027 said Mathis, \u0027to business. Who killed Le Chiffre?\u0027\n \u0027SMERSH,\u0027 said Bond.\n Mathis gave a low whistle.\n \u0027My God,\u0027 he said respectfully. \u0027So they were on to him. What did he look like?\u0027\n Bond explained briefly what had happened up to the moment of Le Chiffre\u0027s death, omitting all but the most essential details. It cost him an effort and he was glad when it was done. Casting his mind back to the scene awoke the whole nightmare and the sweat began to pour off his forehead and a deep throb of pain started up in his body.\n Mathis realized that he was going too far. Bond\u0027s voice was getting feebler and his eyes were clouding. Mathis snapped shut his shorthand book and laid a hand on Bond\u0027s shoulder.\n \u0027Forgive me, my friend,\u0027 he said. \u0027It is all over now and you are in safe hands. All is well and the whole plan has gone splendidly. We have announced that Le Chiffre shot his two accomplices and then committed suicide because he could not face an inquiry into the union funds. Strasbourg and the north are in an uproar. He was considered a great hero there and a pillar of the Communist Party in France. This story of brothels and casinos has absolutely knocked the bottom out of his organization and they\u0027re all running around like scalded cats. At the moment the Communist Party is giving out that he was off his head. But that hasn\u0027t helped much after Thorez\u0027s breakdown not long ago. They\u0027re just making it look as if all their big shots were gaga. God knows how they\u0027re going to unscramble the whole business.\u0027\n Mathis saw that his enthusiasm had had the desired effect. Bond\u0027s eyes were brighter.\n \u0027One last mystery,\u0027 Mathis said, \u0027and then I promise I will go.\u0027 He looked at his watch. \u0027The doctor will be after my skin in a moment. Now, what about the money? Where is it? Where did you hide it? We too have been over your room with a toothcomb. It isn\u0027t there.\u0027\n Bond grinned.\n \u0027It is,\u0027 he said, \u0027more or less. On the door of each room there is a small square of black plastic with the number of the room on it. On the corridor side, of course. When Leiter left me that night, I simply opened the door and unscrewed my number plate and put the folded cheque underneath it and screwed the plate back. It\u0027ll still be there.\u0027 He smiled. \u0027I\u0027m glad there\u0027s something the stupid English can teach the clever French.\u0027\n Mathis laughed delightedly.\n \u0027I suppose you think that\u0027s paid me back for knowing what the Muntzes were up to. Well, I\u0027ll call it quits. Incidentally, we\u0027ve got them in the bag. They were just some minor fry hired for the occasion. We\u0027ll see they get a few years.\u0027\n He rose hastily as the doctor stormed into the room and took one look at Bond.\n \u0027Out,\u0027 he said to Mathis. \u0027Out and don\u0027t come back.\u0027\n Mathis just had time to wave cheerfully to Bond and call some hasty words of farewell before he was hustled through the door. Bond heard a torrent of heated French diminishing; down the corridor. He lay back exhausted, but heartened by all he had heard. He found himself thinking of Vesper as he quickly drifted off into a troubled sleep.\n There were still questions to be answered, but they could wait.\n CHAPTER 20 - THE NATURE OF EVIL\n Bond made good progress. When Mathis came to see him three days later he was propped up in bed and his arms were free. The lower half of his body was still shrouded in the oblong tent, but he looked cheerful and it was only occasionally that a twinge of pain narrowed his eyes.\n Mathis looked crestfallen.\n \u0027Here\u0027s your cheque,\u0027 he said to Bond. \u0027I\u0027ve rather enjoyed walking around with forty million francs in my pocket, but I suppose you\u0027d better sign it and I\u0027ll put it to your account with the Cr‚dit Lyonnais. There\u0027s no sign of our friend from SMERSH. Not a damn trace. He must have got to the villa on foot or on a bicycle because you heard nothing of his arrival and the two gunmen obviously didn\u0027t. It\u0027s pretty exasperating. We\u0027ve got precious little on this SMERSH organization and neither has London. Washington said they had, but it turned out to be the usual waffle from refugee interrogation, and you know that\u0027s about as much good as interrogating an English man-in-the street about his own Secret Service, or a Frenchman about the DeuxiŠme.\u0027\n \u0027He probably came from Leningrad to Berlin via Warsaw,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027From Berlin they\u0027ve got plenty of routes open to the rest of Europe. He\u0027s back home by now being told off for not shooting me too. I fancy they\u0027ve got quite a file on me in view of one or two of the jobs M\u0027s given me since the war. He obviously thought he was being smart enough cutting his initial in my hand.\u0027\n \u0027What\u0027s that?\u0027 asked Mathis. \u0027The doctor said the cuts looked like a square M with a tail to the top. He said they didn\u0027t mean anything.\u0027\n \u0027Well, I only got a glimpse before I passed out, but I\u0027ve seen the cuts several times while they were being dressed and I\u0027m pretty certain they are the Russian letter for SH. It\u0027s rather like an inverted M with a tail. That would make sense; SMERSH is short for SMYERT SHPIONAM - Death to Spies - and he thinks he\u0027s labelled me as a SHPION. It\u0027s a nuisance because M will probably say I\u0027ve got to go to hospital again when I get back to London and have new skin grafted over the whole of the back of my hand. It doesn\u0027t matter much. I\u0027ve decided to resign.\u0027\n Mathis looked at him with his mouth open.\n \u0027Resign?\u0027 he asked incredulously. \u0027What the hell for?\u0027\n Bond looked away from Mathis. He studied his bandaged hands.\n \u0027When I was being beaten up,\u0027 he said, \u0027I suddenly liked the idea of being alive. Before Le Chiffre began, he used a phrase which stuck in my mind . . . “playing Red Indians”. He said that\u0027s what I had been doing. Well, I suddenly thought he might be right.\n \u0027You see,\u0027 he said, still looking down at his bandages, \u0027when one\u0027s young, it seems very easy to distinguish between right and wrong, but as one gets older it becomes more difficult. At school it\u0027s easy to pick out one\u0027s own villains and heroes and one grows up wanting to be a hero and kill the villains.\u0027\n He looked obstinately at Mathis.\n \u0027Well, in the last few years I\u0027ve killed two villains. The first was in New York - a Japanese cipher expert cracking our codes on the thirty-sixth floor of the RCA building in the Rockefeller centre, where the Japs had their consulate. I took a room on the fortieth floor of the next-door skyscraper and I could look across the street into his room and see him working. Then I got a colleague from our organization in New York and a couple of Remington thirty-thirty\u0027s with telescopic sights and silencers. We smuggled them up to my room and sat for days waiting for our chance. He shot at the man a second before me. His job was only to blast a hole through the windows so that I could shoot the Jap through it. They have tough windows at the Rockefeller centre to keep the noise out. It worked very well. As I expected, his bullet got deflected by the glass and went God knows where. But I shot immediately after him, through the hole he had made. I got the Jap in the mouth as he turned to gape at the broken window.\u0027\n Bond smoked for a minute.\n \u0027It was a pretty sound job. Nice and clean too. Three hundred yards away. No personal contact. The next time in Stockholm wasn\u0027t so pretty. I had to kill a Norwegian who was doubling against us for the Germans. He\u0027d managed to get two of our men captured - probably bumped off for all I know. For various reasons it had to be an absolutely silent job. I chose the bedroom of his flat and a knife. And, well, he just didn\u0027t die very quickly.\n \u0027For those two jobs I was awarded a Double O number in the Service. Felt pretty clever and got a reputation for being good and tough. A double O number in our Service means you\u0027ve had to kill a chap in cold blood in the course of some job.\n \u0027Now,\u0027 he looked up again at Mathis, \u0027that\u0027s all very fine. The hero kills two villains, but when the hero Le Chiffre starts to kill the villain Bond and the villain Bond knows he isn\u0027t a villain at all, you see the other side of the medal. The villains and heroes get all mixed up.\n \u0027Of course,\u0027 he added, as Mathis started to expostulate, \u0027patriotism comes along and makes it seem fairly all right, but this country-right-or-wrong business is getting a little out-of-date. Today we are fighting Communism. Okay. If I\u0027d been alive fifty years ago, the brand of Conservatism we have today would have been damn near called Communism and we should have been told to go and fight that. History is moving pretty quickly these days and the heroes and villains keep on changing parts.\u0027\n Mathis stared at him aghast. Then he tapped his head and put a calming hand on Bond\u0027s arm.\n \u0027You mean to say that this precious Le Chiffre who did his best to turn you into a eunuch doesn\u0027t qualify as a villain?\u0027 he asked. \u0027Anyone would think from the rot you talk that he had been battering your head instead of your . . .\u0027 He gestured down the bed. \u0027You wait till M tells you to get after another Le Chiffre. I bet you\u0027ll go after him all right. And what about SMERSH? I can tell you I don\u0027t like the idea of these chaps running around France killing anyone they feel has been a traitor to their precious political system. You\u0027re a bloody anarchist.\u0027\n He threw his arms in the air and let them fall helplessly to his sides.\n Bond laughed.\n \u0027All right,\u0027 he said. \u0027Take our friend Le Chiffre. It\u0027s simple enough to say he was an evil man, at least it\u0027s simple enough for me because he did evil things to me. If he was here now, I wouldn\u0027t hesitate to kill him, but out of personal revenge and not, I\u0027m afraid, for some high moral reason or for the sake of my country.\u0027\n He looked up at Mathis to see how bored he was getting with these introspective refinements of what, to Mathis, was a simple question of duty. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/casino-royale-james-bond-1/page-17.html","bookId":2424,"book":{"id":2424,"title":"Casino Royale (James Bond #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Casino Royale (James Bond (Original Series) #1) \n In the first of Ian Fleming\u0027s James Bond novels, 007 declares war on Le Chiffre, French communist and paymaster of the Soviet murder organization SMERSH. \n The battle begins with a fifty-million-franc game of baccarat, gains momentum during Bond\u0027s fiery love affair with a sensuous lady spy, and reaches a chilling climax with fiendish torture at the hands of a master sadist.
