{"id":77349,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"Bond felt her presence strongly. While he and Mathis talked, he turned from time to time towards her, politely including her in the conversation, but adding up the impressions recorded by each glance.\n Her hair was very black and she wore it cut square and low on the nape of the neck, framing her face to below the clear and beautiful line of her jaw. Although it was heavy and moved with the movements of her head, she did not constantly pat it back into place, but let it alone. Her eyes were wide apart and deep blue and they gazed candidly back at Bond with a touch of ironical disinterest which, to his annoyance, he found he would like to shatter, roughly. Her skin was lightly sun-tanned and bore no trace of makeup except on her mouth which was wide and sensual. Her bare arms and hands had a quality of repose and the general impression of restraint in her appearance and movements was carried even to her fingernails which were unpainted and cut short. Round her neck she wore a plain gold chain of wide flat links and on the fourth finger of the right hand a broad topaz ring. Her medium-length dress was of grey soie sauvage with a square-cut bodice, lasciviously tight across her fine breasts. The skirt was closely pleated and flowered down from a narrow, but not a thin, waist. She wore a three-inch, handstitched black belt. A handstitched black sabretache rested on the chair beside her, together with a wide cart-wheel hat of gold straw, its crown encircled by a thin black velvet ribbon which tied at the back in a short bow. Her shoes were square-toed of plain black leather.\n Bond was excited by her beauty and intrigued by her composure. The prospect of working with her stimulated him. At the same time he felt a vague disquiet. On an impulse he touched wood.\n Mathis had noticed Bond\u0027s preoccupation. After a time he rose.\n \u0027Forgive me,\u0027 he said to the girl, \u0027while I telephone to the Dubernes. I must arrange my rendezvous for dinner tonight. Are you sure you won\u0027t mind being left to your own devices this evening?\u0027\n She shook her head.\n Bond took the cue and, as Mathis crossed the room to the telephone booth beside the bar, he said: \u0027If you are going to be alone tonight, would you care to have dinner with me?\u0027\n She smiled with the first hint of conspiracy she had shown. \u0027I would like to very much,\u0027 she said, \u0027and then perhaps you would chaperon me to the Casino where Monsieur Mathis tells me you are very much at home. Perhaps I will bring you luck.\u0027\n With Mathis gone, her attitude towards him showed a sudden warmth. She seemed to acknowledge that they were a team and, as they discussed the time and place of their meeting, Bond realized that it would be quite easy after all to plan the details of his project with her. He felt that after all she was interested and excited by her role and that she would work willingly with him. He had imagined many hurdles before establishing a rapport, but now he felt he could get straight down to professional details. He was quite honest to himself about the hypocrisy of his attitude towards her. As a woman, he wanted to sleep with her but only when the job had been done.\n When Mathis came back to the table Bond called for his bill. He explained that he was expected back at his hotel to have lunch with friends. When for a moment he held her hand in his he felt a warmth of affection and understanding pass between them that would have seemed impossible half an hour earlier.\n The girl\u0027s eyes followed him out on to the boulevard.\n Mathis moved his chair close to hers and said softly: \u0027That is a very good friend of mine. I am glad you have met each other. I can already feel the ice-floes on the two rivers breaking up.\u0027 He smiled, \u0027I don\u0027t think Bond has ever been melted. It will be a new experience for him. And for you.\u0027\n She did not answer him directly.\n \u0027He is very good-looking. He reminds me rather of Hoagy Carmichael, but there is something cold and ruthless in his . . .\u0027\n The sentence was never finished. Suddenly a few feet away the entire plate-glass window shivered into confetti. The blast of a terrific explosion, very near, hit them so that they were rocked back in their chairs. There was an instant of silence. Some objects pattered down on to the pavement outside. Bottles slowly toppled off the shelves behind the bar. Then there were screams and a stampede for the door.\n \u0027Stay there,\u0027 said Mathis.\n He kicked back his chair and hurtled through the empty window-frame on to the pavement.\n CHAPTER 6 - TWO MEN IN STRAW HATS\n When Bond left the bar he walked purposefully along the pavement flanking the tree-lined boulevard towards his hotel a few hundred yards away. He was hungry.\n The day was still beautiful, but by now the sun was very hot and the plane-trees, spaced about twenty feet apart on the grass verge between the pavement and the broad tarmac, gave a cool shade.\n There were few people abroad and the two men standing quietly under a tree on the opposite side of the boulevard looked out of place.\n Bond noticed them when he was still a hundred yards away and when the same distance separated them from the ornamental porte cochŠre of the Splendide.\n There was something rather disquieting about their appearance. They were both small and they were dressed alike in dark and, Bond reflected, rather hot-looking suits. They had the appearance of a variety turn waiting for a bus on the way to the theatre. Each wore a straw hat with a thick black ribbon as a concession, perhaps, to the holiday atmosphere of the resort, and the brims of these and the shadow from the tree under which they stood obscured their faces. Incongruously, each dark, squat little figure was illuminated by a touch of bright colour. They were both carrying; square camera-cases slung from the shoulder.\n And one case was bright red and the other case bright blue.\n By the time Bond had taken in these details, he had come to within fifty yards of the two men. He was reflecting on the ranges of various types of weapon and the possibilities of cover when an extraordinary and terrible scene was enacted.\n Red-man seemed to give a short nod to Blue-man. With a quick movement Blue-man unslung his blue camera-case. Blue-man, and Bond could not see exactly as the trunk of a plane-tree beside him just then intervened to obscure his vision, bent forward and seemed to fiddle with the case. Then with a blinding flash of white light there was the ear-splitting crack of a monstrous explosion and Bond, despite the protection of the tree-trunk, was slammed down to the pavement by a bolt of hot air which dented his cheeks and stomach as if they had been made of paper. He lay, gazing up at the sun, while the air (or so it seemed to him) went on twanging with the explosion as if someone had hit the bass register of a piano with a sledgehammer.\n When, dazed and half-conscious, he raised himself on one knee, a ghastly rain of pieces of flesh and shreds of blood-soaked clothing fell on him and around him, mingled with branches and gravel. Then a shower of small twigs and leaves. From all sides came the sharp tinkle of falling glass. Above in the sky hung a mushroom of black smoke which rose and dissolved as he drunkenly watched it. There was an obscene smell of high explosive, of burning wood, and of, yes, that was it - roast mutton. For fifty yards down the boulevard the trees were leafless and charred. Opposite, two of them had snapped off near the base and lay drunkenly across the road. Between them there was a still smoking crater. Of the two men in straw hats, there remained absolutely nothing. But there were red traces on the road, and on the pavements and against the trunks of the trees, and there were glittering shreds high up in the branches.\n Bond felt himself starting to vomit.\n It was Mathis who got to him first, and by that time Bond was standing with his arm round the tree which had saved his life.\n Stupefied, but unharmed, he allowed Mathis to lead him off towards the Splendide from which guests and servants were pouring in chattering fright. As the distant clang of bells heralded the arrival of ambulances and fire-engines, they managed to push through the throng and up the short stairs and along the corridor to Bond\u0027s room.\n Mathis paused only to turn on the radio in front of the fireplace, then, while Bond stripped off his blood-flecked clothes, Mathis sprayed him with questions.\n When it came to the description of the two men, Mathis tore the telephone off its hook beside Bond\u0027s bed.\n \u0027... and tell the police,\u0027 he concluded, \u0027tell them that the Englishman from Jamaica who was knocked over by the blast is my affair. He is unhurt and they are not to worry him. I will explain to them in half an hour. They should tell the Press that it was apparently a vendetta between two Bulgarian Communists and that one killed the other with a bomb. They need say nothing of the third Bulgar who must have been hanging about somewhere, lout they must get him at all costs. He will certainly head for Paris. Road-blocks everywhere. Understand? Alors, bonne chance.\u0027\n Mathis turned back to Bond and heard him to the end.\n \u0027Merde, but you were lucky,\u0027 he said when Bond had finished. \u0027Clearly the bomb was intended for you. It must have been faulty. They intended to throw it and then dodge behind their tree. But it all came out the other way round. Never mind. We will discover the facts.\u0027 He paused. \u0027But certainly it is a curious affair. And these people appear to be taking you seriously.\u0027 Mathis looked affronted. \u0027But how did these sacr‚ Bulgars intend to escape capture? And what was the significance of the red and the blue cases? We must try and find some fragments of the red one.\u0027\n Mathis bit his nails. He was excited and his eyes glittered. This was becoming a formidable and dramatic affair, in many aspects of which he was now involved personally. Certainly it was no longer just a case of holding Bond\u0027s coat while he had his private battle with Le Chiffre in the Casino. Mathis jumped up.\n \u0027Now get a drink and some lunch and a rest,\u0027 he ordered Bond. \u0027For me, I must get my nose quickly into this affair before the police have muddied the trail with their big black boots.\u0027\n Mathis turned off the radio and waved an affectionate farewell. The door slammed and silence settled on the room. Bond sat for a while by the window and enjoyed being alive.\n Later, as Bond was finishing his first straight whisky \u0027on the rocks\u0027 and was contemplating the pat‚ de foie gras and cold langouste which the waiter had just laid out for him, the telephone rang.\n \u0027This is Mademoiselle Lynd.\u0027\n The voice was low and anxious.\n \u0027Are you all right?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, quite.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m glad. Please take care of yourself.\u0027\n She rang off.\n Bond shook himself, then he picked up his knife and selected the thickest of the pieces of hot toast.\n He suddenly thought: two of them are dead, and I have got one more on my side. It\u0027s a start.\n He dipped the knife into the glass of very hot water which stood beside the pot of Strasbourg porcelain and reminded himself to tip the waiter doubly for this particular meal.\n CHAPTER 7 - ROUGE ET NOIR\n Bond was determined to be completely fit and relaxed for a gambling session which might last most of the night. He ordered a masseur for three o\u0027clock. After the remains of his luncheon had been removed, he sat at his window gazing out to sea until there came a knock on the door as the masseur, a Swede, presented himself\n Silently he got to work on Bond from his feet to his neck, melting the tensions in his body and calming his still twanging nerves. Even the long purpling bruises down Bond\u0027s left shoulder and side ceased to throb, and when the Swede had gone Bond fell into a dreamless sleep.\n He awoke in the evening completely refreshed.\n After a cold shower, Bond walked over to the Casino. Since the night before he had lost the mood of the tables. He needed to re-establish that focus which is half mathematical and half intuitive and which, with a slow pulse and a sanguine temperament, Bond knew to be the essential equipment of any gambler who was set on winning. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/casino-royale-james-bond-1/page-5.html","bookId":2424,"book":{"id":2424,"title":"Casino Royale (James Bond #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Casino Royale (James Bond (Original Series) #1) \n In the first of Ian Fleming\u0027s James Bond novels, 007 declares war on Le Chiffre, French communist and paymaster of the Soviet murder organization SMERSH. \n The battle begins with a fifty-million-franc game of baccarat, gains momentum during Bond\u0027s fiery love affair with a sensuous lady spy, and reaches a chilling climax with fiendish torture at the hands of a master sadist.
