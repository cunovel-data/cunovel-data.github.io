{"id":77354,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"\u0027I shouldn\u0027t have let it come to you,\u0027 she said. \u0027Directly the cards were dealt I kicked myself.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s only the beginning of the game,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027You may be right the next time you pass it.\u0027\\n\\n Mr Du Pont leant forward from the other side of his wife: \u0027If one could be right every hand, none of us would be here,\u0027 he said philosophically.\\n\\n \u0027I would be,\u0027 his wife laughed. \u0027You don\u0027t think I do this for pleasure.\u0027\\n\\n As the game went on, Bond looked over the spectators leaning on the high brass rail round the table. He soon saw Le Chiffre\u0027s two gunmen. They stood behind and to either side of the banker. They looked respectable enough, but not sufficiently a part of the game to be unobtrusive.\\n\\n The one more or less behind Le Chiffre\u0027s right arm was tall and funereal in his dinner-jacket. His face was wooden and grey, but his eyes flickered and gleamed like a conjurer\u0027s. His whole long body was restless and his hands shifted often on the brass rail. Bond guessed that he would kill without interest or concern for what he killed and that he would prefer strangling. He had something of Lennie in Of Mice and Men, but his inhumanity would not come from infantilism but from drugs. Marihuana, decided Bond.\\n\\n The other man looked like a Corsican shopkeeper. He was short and very dark with a flat head covered with thickly greased hair. He seemed to be a cripple. A chunky malacca cane with a rubber tip hung on the rail beside him. He must have had permission to bring the cane into the Casino with him, reflected Bond, who knew that neither sticks nor any other objects were allowed in the rooms as a precaution against acts of violence. He looked sleek and well fed. His mouth hung vacantly half-open and revealed very bad teeth. He wore a heavy black moustache and the backs of his hands on the rail were matted with black hair. Bond guessed that hair covered most of his squat body. Naked, Bond supposed, he would be an obscene object.\\n\\n The game continued uneventfully, but with a slight bias against the bank.\\n\\n The third coup is the \u0027sound barrier\u0027 at chemin-de-fer and baccarat. Your luck can defeat the first and second tests, but when the third deal comes along it most often spells disaster. Again and again at this point you find yourself being bounced back to earth. It was like that now. Neither the bank nor any of the players seemed to be able to get hot. But there was a steady and inexorable seepage against the bank, amounting after about two hours\u0027 play to ten million francs. Bond had no idea what profits Le Chiffre had made over the past two days. He estimated them at five million and guessed that now the banker\u0027s capital could not be more than twenty million.\\n\\n In fact, Le Chiffre had lost heavily all that afternoon. At this moment he only had ten million left.\\n\\n Bond, on the other hand, by one o\u0027clock in the morning, had won four million, bringing his resources up to twenty-eight million.\\n\\n Bond was cautiously pleased. Le Chiffre showed no trace of emotion. He continued to play like an automaton, never speaking except when he gave instructions in a low aside to the croupier at the opening of each new bank.\\n\\n Outside the pool of silence round the high table, there was the constant hum of the other tables, chemin-de-fer, roulette and trente-et-quarante, interspersed with the clear calls of the croupiers and occasional bursts of laughter or gasps of excitement from different corners of the huge salle.\\n\\n In the background there thudded always the hidden metronome of the Casino, ticking up its little treasure of one-per-cents with each spin of a wheel and each turn of a card - a pulsing fat-cat with a zero for a heart.\\n\\n It was at ten minutes past one by Bond\u0027s watch when, at the high table, the whole pattern of play suddenly altered.\\n\\n The Greek at Number 1 was still having a bad time. He had lost the first coup of half a million francs and the second. He passed the third time, leaving a bank of two millions. Carmel Delane at Number 2 refused it. So did Lady Danvers at Number 3.\\n\\n The Du Ponts looked at each other.\\n\\n \u0027Banco,\u0027 said Mrs Du Pont, and promptly lost to the banker\u0027s natural eight.\\n\\n \u0027Un banco de quatre millions,\u0027 said the croupier.\\n\\n \u0027Banco,\u0027 said Bond, pushing out a wad of notes.\\n\\n Again he fixed Le Chiffre with his eye. Again he gave only a cursory look at his two cards.\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 he said. He held a marginal five. The position was dangerous.\\n\\n Le Chiffre turned up a knave and a four. He gave the shoe another slap. He drew a three.\\n\\n \u0027Sept â€¦ la banque,\u0027 said the croupier, \u0027et cinq,\u0027 he added as he tipped Bond\u0027s losing cards face upwards. He raked over Bond\u0027s money, extracted four million francs and returned the remainder to Bond.\\n\\n \u0027Un banco de huit millions.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Suivi,\u0027 said Bond.\\n\\n And lost again, to a natural nine.\\n\\n In two coups he had lost twelve million francs. By scraping the barrel, he had just sixteen million francs left, exactly the amount of the next banco.\\n\\n Suddenly Bond felt the sweat on his palms. Like snow in sunshine his capital had melted. With the covetous deliberation of the winning gambler, Le Chiffre was tapping a light tattoo on the table with his right hand. Bond looked across into the eyes of murky basalt. They held an ironical question. \u0027Do you want the full treatment?\u0027 they seemed to ask.\\n\\n \u0027Suivi,\u0027 Bond said softly.\\n\\n He took some notes and plaques out of his right hand pocket and the entire stack of notes out of his left and pushed them forward. There was no hint in his movements that this would be his last stake.\\n\\n His mouth felt suddenly as dry as flock wall-paper. He looked up and saw Vesper and Felix Leiter standing where the gunman with the stick had stood. He did not know how long they had been standing there. Leiter looked faintly worried, but Vesper smiled encouragement at him.\\n\\n He heard a faint rattle on the rail behind him and turned his head. The battery of bad teeth under the black moustache gaped vacantly back at him.\\n\\n \u0027Le jeu est fait,\u0027 said the croupier, and the two cards came slithering towards him over the green baize - a green baize which was no longer smooth, but thick now, and furry and almost choking, its colour as livid as the grass on a fresh tomb.\\n\\n The light from the broad satin-lined shades which had seemed so welcoming now seemed to take the colour out of his hand as he glanced at the cards. Then he looked again.\\n\\n It was nearly as bad as it could have been - the king of hearts and an ace, the ace of spades. It squinted up at him like a black widow spider.\\n\\n \u0027A card.\u0027 He still kept all emotion out of his voice.\\n\\n Le Chiffre faced his own two cards. He had a queen and a black five. He looked at Bond and pressed out another card with a wide forefinger. The table was absolutely silent. He faced it and flicked it away. The croupier lifted it delicately with his spatula and slipped it over to Bond. It was a good card, the five of hearts, but to Bond it was a difficult fingerprint in dried blood. He now had a count of six and Le Chiffre a count of five, but the banker having a five and giving a five, would and must draw another card and try and improve with a one, two, three or four. Drawing any other card he would be defeated.\\n\\n The odds were on Bond\u0027s side, but now it was Le Chiffre who looked across into Bond\u0027s eyes and hardly glanced at the card as he flicked it face upwards on the table.\\n\\n It was, unnecessarily, the best, a four, giving the bank a count of nine. He had won, almost slowing up.\\n\\n Bond was beaten and cleaned out.\\n\\n CHAPTER 12 - THE DEADLY TUBE\\n\\n Bond sat silent, frozen with defeat. He opened his wide black case and took out a cigarette. He snapped open the tiny jaws of the Ronson and lit the cigarette and put the lighter back on the table. He took a deep lungful of smoke and expelled it between his teeth with a faint hiss.\\n\\n What now? Back to the hotel and bed, avoiding the commiserating eyes of Mathis and Leiter and Vesper. Back to the telephone call to London, and then tomorrow the plane home, the taxi up to Regent\u0027s Park, the walk up the stairs and along the corridor, and M\u0027s cold face across the table, his forced sympathy, his \u0027better luck next time\u0027 and, of course, there couldn\u0027t be one, not another chance like this.\\n\\n He looked round the table and up at the spectators. Few were looking at him. They were waiting while the croupier counted the money and piled up the chips in a neat stack in front of the banker, waiting to see if anyone would conceivably challenge this huge bank of thirty-two million Francs, this wonderful run of banker\u0027s luck.\\n\\n Leiter had vanished, not wishing to look Bond in the eye after the knock-out, he supposed. Yet Vesper looked curiously unmoved, she gave him a smile of encouragement. But then, Bond reflected, she knew nothing of the game. Had no notion, probably, of the bitterness of his defeat.\\n\\n The huissier was coming towards Bond inside the rail. He stopped beside him. Bent over him. Placed a squat envelope beside Bond on the table. It was as thick as a dictionary. Said something about the caisse. Moved away again.\\n\\n Bond\u0027s heart thumped. He took the heavy anonymous envelope below the level of the table and slit it open with his thumbnail, noticing that the gum was still wet on the flap.\\n\\n Unbelieving and yet knowing it was true, he felt the broad wads of notes. He slipped them into his pockets, retaining the half-sheet of note-paper which was pinned to the topmost of them. He glanced at it in the shadow below the table. There was one line of writing in ink: \u0027Marshall Aid. Thirty-two million francs. With the compliments of the USA.\u0027\\n\\n Bond swallowed. He looked over towards Vesper. Felix Leiter was again standing beside her. He grinned slightly and Bond smiled back and raised his hand from the table in a small gesture of benediction. Then he set his mind to sweeping away all traces of the sense of complete defeat which had swamped him a few minutes before. This was a reprieve, but only a reprieve. There could be no more miracles. This time he had to win - if Le Chiffre had not already made his fifty million - if he was going to go on!\\n\\n The croupier had completed his task of computing the cagnotte, changing Bond\u0027s notes into plaques and making a pile of the giant stake in the middle of the table.\\n\\n There lay thirty-two thousand pounds. Perhaps, thought Bond, Le Chiffre needed just one more coup, even a minor one of a few million francs, to achieve his object. Then he would have made his fifty million francs and would leave the table. By tomorrow his deficits would be covered and his position secure.\\n\\n He showed no signs of moving and Bond guessed with relief that somehow he must have overestimated Le Chiffre\u0027s resources.\\n\\n The then only hope, thought Bond, was to stamp on him now. Not to share the bank with the table, or to take some minor part of it, but to go the whole hog. This would really jolt Le Chiffre. He would hate to see more than ten or fifteen million of the stake covered, and he could not possibly expect anyone to banco the entire thirty-two millions. He might not know that Bond had been cleaned out, but he must imagine that Bond had by now only small reserves. He could not know of the contents of the envelope if he did, he would probably withdraw the bank and start all over again on the wearisome journey up from the five hundred thousand franc opening bet.\\n\\n The analysis was right.\\n\\n Le Chiffre needed another eight million.\\n\\n At last he nodded.\\n\\n \u0027Un banco de trente-deux millions.\u0027\\n\\n The croupier\u0027s voice rang out. A silence built itself up round the table.\\n\\n \u0027Un banco de trente-deux millions.\u0027\\n\\n In a louder, prouder voice the chef de partie took up the cry, hoping to draw big money away from the neighbouring chemin-de-fer tables. Besides, this was wonderful publicity. The stake had only once been reached in the history of baccarat - at Deauville in 1950. The rival Casino de la ForË†t at Le Touquet had never got near it. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/casino-royale-james-bond-1/page-10.html","bookId":2424,"book":{"id":2424,"title":"Casino Royale (James Bond #1)","description":"Storyline: Casino Royale (James Bond (Original Series) #1) \\n In the first of Ian Fleming\u0027s James Bond novels, 007 declares war on Le Chiffre, French communist and paymaster of the Soviet murder organization SMERSH. \\n The battle begins with a fifty-million-franc game of baccarat, gains momentum during Bond\u0027s fiery love affair with a sensuous lady spy, and reaches a chilling climax with fiendish torture at the hands of a master sadist.
