Perhaps her nerves had been more shaken by the events at the villa than he had imagined.\n The bath had been filled for him and there was a new flask of some expensive pine bath-essence on a chair beside it with his towel.\n \u0027Vesper,\u0027 he called.\n \u0027Yes?\u0027\n \u0027You really are the limit. You make me feel like an expensive gigolo.\u0027\n \u0027I was told to look after you. I\u0027m only doing what I was told.\u0027\n \u0027Darling, the bath\u0027s absolutely right. Will you marry me?\u0027\n She snorted. \u0027You need a slave, not a wife.\u0027\n \u0027I want you.\u0027\n \u0027Well, I want my lobster and champagne, so hurry up.\u0027\n \u0027All right, all right,\u0027 said Bond.\n He dried himself and dressed in a white shirt and dark blue slacks. He hoped that she would be dressed as simply and he was pleased when, without knocking, she appeared in the doorway wearing a blue linen shirt which had faded to the colour of her eyes and a dark red skirt in pleated cotton.\n \u0027I couldn\u0027t wait. I was famished. My room\u0027s over the kitchen and I\u0027ve been tortured by the wonderful smells.\u0027\n He came over and put his arm round her.\n She took his hand and together they went downstairs out on to the terrace where their table had been laid in the light cast by the empty dining-room.\n The champagne which Bond had ordered on their arrival stood on a plated wine-cooler beside their table and Bond poured out two full glasses. Vesper busied herself with a delicious home-made liver patâ€š and helped them both to the crisp French bread and the thick square of deep yellow butter set in chips of ice.\n They looked at each other and drank deeply and Bond filled their glasses again to the rim.\n While they ate Bond told her of his bathe and they talked of what they would do in the morning. All through the meal they left unspoken their feelings for each other, but in Vesper\u0027s eyes as much as in Bond\u0027s there was excited anticipation of the night. They let their hands and their feet touch from time to time as if to ease the tension in their bodies.\n When the lobster had come and gone and the second bottle of champagne was half-empty and they had just ladled thick cream over their fraises des bois, Vesper gave a deep sigh of contentment.\n \u0027I\u0027m behaving like a pig,\u0027 she said happily. \u0027You always give me all the things I like best. I\u0027ve never been so spoiled before.\u0027 She gazed across the terrace at the moonlit bay. \u0027I wish I deserved it.\u0027 Her voice had a wry undertone.\n \u0027What do you mean?\u0027 asked Bond surprised.\n \u0027Oh, I don\u0027t know. I suppose people get what they deserve, so perhaps I do deserve it.\u0027\n She looked at him and smiled. Her eyes narrowed quizzically.\n \u0027You really don\u0027t know much about me,\u0027 she said suddenly.\n Bond was surprised by the undertone of seriousness in her voice.\n \u0027Quite enough,\u0027 he said laughing. \u0027All I need until tomorrow and the next day and the next. You don\u0027t know much about me for the matter of that.\u0027 He poured out more champagne.\n Vesper looked at him thoughtfully.\n \u0027People are islands,\u0027 she said. \u0027They don\u0027t really touch. However close they are, they\u0027re really quite separate. Even if they\u0027ve been married for fifty years.\u0027\n Bond thought with dismay that she must be going into a vin triste. Too much champagne had made her melancholy. But suddenly she gave a happy laugh. \u0027Don\u0027t look so worried.\u0027 She leaned forward and put her hand over his. \u0027I was only being sentimental. Anyway, my island feels very close to your island tonight.\u0027 She took a sip of champagne.\n Bond laughed, relieved. \u0027Let\u0027s join up and make a peninsula,\u0027 he said. \u0027Now, directly we\u0027ve finished the strawberries.\u0027\n \u0027No,\u0027 she said, flirting. \u0027I must have coffee.\u0027\n \u0027And brandy,\u0027 countered Bond.\n The small shadow had passed. The second small shadow. This too left a tiny question-mark hanging in the air. It quickly dissolved as warmth and intimacy enclosed them again.\n When they had had their coffee and Bond was sipping his brandy, Vesper picked up her bag and came and stood behind him.\n \u0027I\u0027m tired,\u0027 she said, resting a hand on his shoulder.\n He reached up and held it there and they stayed motionless for a moment. She bent down and lightly brushed his hair with her lips. Then she was gone and a few seconds later the light came on in her room.\n Bond smoked and waited until it had gone out. Then he followed her, pausing only to say good night to the proprietor and his wife and thank them for the dinner. They exchanged compliments and he went upstairs.\n It was only half past nine when he stepped into her room from the bathroom and closed the door behind him.\n The moonlight shone through the half-closed shutters and lapped at the secret shadows in the snow of her body on the broad bed.\n Bond awoke in his own room at dawn and for a time he lay and stroked his memories.\n Then he got quietly out of bed and in his pyjama-coat he crept past Vesper\u0027s door and out of the house to the beach.\n The sea was smooth and quiet in the sunrise. The small pink waves idly licked the sand. It was cold, but he took off his jacket and wandered naked along the edge of the sea to the point where he had bathed the evening before, then he walked slowly and deliberately into the water until it was just below his chin. He took his feet off the bottom and sank, holding his nose with one hand and shutting his eyes, feeling the cold water comb his body and his hair.\n The mirror of the bay was unbroken except where it seemed a fish had jumped. Under the water he imagined the tranquil scene and wished that Vesper could just then come through the pines and be astonished to see him suddenly erupt from the empty seascape.\n When after a full minute he came to the surface in a froth of spray, he was disappointed. There was no one in sight. For a time he swam and drifted and then when the sun seemed hot enough, he came in to the beach and lay on his back and revelled in the body which the night had given back to him.\n As on the evening before, he stared up into the empty sky and saw the same answer there.\n After a while he rose and walked back slowly along the beach to his pyjama-coat.\n That day he would ask Vesper to marry him. He was quite certain. It was only a question of choosing the right moment.\n CHAPTER 25 - \u0027BLACK-PATCH\u0027\n As he walked quietly from the terrace into the half-darkness of the still shuttered dining-room, he was surprised to see Vesper emerge from the glass-fronted telephone booth near the front door and softly turn up the stairs towards their rooms.\n \u0027Vesper,\u0027 he called, thinking she must have had some urgent message which might concern them both.\n She turned quickly, a hand up to her mouth.\n For a moment longer than necessary she stared at him, her eyes wide.\n \u0027What is it, darling?\u0027 he asked, vaguely troubled and fearing some crisis in their lives.\n \u0027Oh,\u0027 she said breathlessly, \u0027you made me jump. It was only . . . I was just telephoning to Mathis. To Mathis,\u0027 she repeated. \u0027I wondered if he could get me another frock. You know, from that girl-friend I told you about. The vendeuse. You see,\u0027 she talked quickly, her words coming out in a persuasive jumble, \u0027I\u0027ve really got nothing to wear. I thought I\u0027d catch him at home before he went to the office. I don\u0027t know my friend\u0027s telephone number and I thought it would be a surprise for you. I didn\u0027t want you to hear me moving and wake you up. Is the water nice? Have you bathed? You ought to have waited for me.\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s wonderful,\u0027 said Bond, deciding to relieve her mind, though irritated with her obvious guilt over this childish mystery. \u0027You must go in and we\u0027ll have breakfast on the terrace. I\u0027m ravenous. I\u0027m sorry I made you jump. I was just startled to see anyone about at this hour of the morning.\u0027\n He put his arm round her, but she disengaged herself, and moved quickly on up the stairs.\n \u0027It was such a surprise to see you,\u0027 she said, trying to cover the incident up with a light touch. \u0027You looked like a ghost, a drowned man, with the hair down over your eyes like that.\u0027 She laughed harshly. Hearing the harshness, she turned the laugh into a cough.\n \u0027I hope I haven\u0027t caught cold,\u0027 she said.\n She kept on patching up the edifice of her deceit until Bond wanted to spank her and tell her to relax and tell the truth. Instead he just gave her a reassuring pat on the back outside her room and told her to hurry up and have her bathe.\n Then he went on to his room.\n That was the end of the integrity of their love. The succeeding days were a shambles of falseness and hypocrisy, mingled with her tears and moments of animal passion to which she abandoned herself with a greed made indecent by the hollowness of their days.\n Several times Bond tried to break down the dreadful walls of mistrust. Again and again he brought up the subject of the telephone call, but she obstinately bolstered up her story with embellishments which Bond knew she had thought out afterwards. She even accused Bond of thinking she had another lover.\n These scenes always ended in her bitter tears and in moments almost of hysteria.\n Each day the atmosphere became more hateful.\n It seemed fantastic to Bond that human relationships could collapse into dust overnight and he searched his mind again and again for a reason.\n He felt that Vesper was just as horrified as he was and, if anything, her misery seemed greater than his. But the mystery of the telephone conversation which Vesper angrily, almost fearfully it seemed to Bond, refused to explain was a shadow which grew darker with other small mysteries and reticences.\n Already at luncheon on that day things got worse.\n After a breakfast which was an effort for both of them, Vesper said she had a headache and would stay in her room out of the sun. Bond took a book and walked for miles down the beach. By the time he returned he had argued to himself that they would be able to sort the problem out over lunch.\n Directly they sat down, he apologized gaily for having startled her at the telephone booth and then he dismissed the subject and went on to describe what he had seen on his walk. But Vesper was distrait and commented only in monosyllables. She toyed with her food and she avoided Bond\u0027s eyes and gazed past him with an air of preoccupation.\n When she had failed once or twice to respond to some conversational gambit or other, Bond also relapsed into silence and occupied himself with his own gloomy thoughts.\n All of a sudden she stiffened. Her fork fell with a clatter on to the edge of her plate and then noisily off the table on to the terrace.\n Bond looked up. She had gone as white as a sheet and she was looking over his shoulder with terror in her face.\n Bond turned his head and saw that a man had just taken his place at a table on the opposite side of the terrace, well away from them. He seemed ordinary enough, perhaps rather sombrely dressed, but in his first quick glance Bond put him down as some business-man on his way along the coast who had just happened on the inn or had picked it out of the Michelin.\n \u0027What is it, darling?\u0027 he asked anxiously.\n Vesper\u0027s eyes never moved from the distant figure.\n \u0027It\u0027s the man in the car,\u0027 she said in a stifled voice. \u0027The man who was following us. I know it is.\u0027\n Bond looked again over his shoulder. The patron was discussing the menu with the new customer. It was a perfectly normal scene. They exchanged smiles over some item on the menu and apparently agreed that it would suit for the patron took the card and with, Bond guessed, a final exchange about the wine, he withdrew.\n The man seemed to realize that he was being watched. He looked up and gazed incuriously at them for a moment. Then he reached for a brief-case on the chair beside him, extracted a newspaper and started to read it his elbows propped up on the table. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/casino-royale-james-bond-1/page-21.html","bookId":2424,"book":{"id":2424,"title":"Casino Royale (James Bond #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Casino Royale (James Bond (Original Series) #1) \n In the first of Ian Fleming\u0027s James Bond novels, 007 declares war on Le Chiffre, French communist and paymaster of the Soviet murder organization SMERSH. \n The battle begins with a fifty-million-franc game of baccarat, gains momentum during Bond\u0027s fiery love affair with a sensuous lady spy, and reaches a chilling climax with fiendish torture at the hands of a master sadist.
