{"id":77362,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"Mathis smiled back at him.\\n\\n \u0027Continue, my dear friend. It is interesting for me to see this new Bond. Englishmen are so odd. They are like a nest of Chinese boxes. It takes a very long time to get to the centre of them. When one gets there the result is unrewarding, but the process is instructive and entertaining. Continue. Develop your arguments. There may be something I can use to my own chief the next time I want to get out of an unpleasant job.\u0027 He grinned maliciously.\\n\\n Bond ignored him.\\n\\n \u0027Now in order to tell the difference between good and evil, we have manufactured two images representing the extremes - representing the deepest black and the purest white - and we call them God and the Devil. But in doing so we have cheated a bit. God is a clear image, you can see every hair on His beard. But the Devil. What does he look like?\u0027 Bond looked triumphantly at Mathis.\\n\\n Mathis laughed ironically.\\n\\n \u0027A woman.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s all very fine,\u0027 said Bond, \u0027but I\u0027ve been thinking about these things and I\u0027m wondering whose side I ought to be on. I\u0027m getting very sorry for the Devil and his disciples such as the good Le Chiffre. The Devil has a rotten time and I always like to be on the side of the underdog. We don\u0027t give the poor chap a chance. There\u0027s a Good Book about goodness and how to be good and so forth, but there\u0027s no Evil Book about evil and how to be bad. The Devil has no prophets to write his Ten Commandments and no team of authors to write his biography. His case has gone completely by default. We know nothing about him but a lot of fairy stories from our parents and schoolmasters. He has no book from which we can learn the nature of evil in all its forms, with parables about evil people, proverbs about evil people, folk-lore about evil people. All we have is the living example of the people who are least good, or our own intuition.\\n\\n \u0027So,\u0027 continued Bond, warming to his argument, \u0027Le Chiffre was serving a wonderful purpose, a really vital purpose, perhaps the best and highest purpose of all. By his evil existence, which foolishly I have helped to destroy, he was creating a norm of badness by which, and by which alone, an opposite norm of goodness could exist. We were privileged, in our short knowledge of him, to see and estimate his wickedness and we emerge from the acquaintanceship better and more virtuous men.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Bravo,\u0027 said Mathis. \u0027I\u0027m proud of you. You ought to be tortured every day. I really must remember to do something evil this evening. I must start at once. I have a few marks in my favour - only small ones, alas,\u0027 he added ruefully - \u0027but I shall work fast now that I have seen the light. What a splendid time I\u0027m going to have. Now, let\u0027s see, where shall I start, murder, arson, rape? But no, these are peccadilloes. I must really consult the good Marquis de Sade. I am a child, an absolute child in these matters.\u0027\\n\\n His face fell.\\n\\n \u0027Ah, but our conscience, my dear Bond. What shall we do with him while we are committing some juicy sin? That is a problem. He is a crafty person this conscience and very old, as old as the first family of apes which gave birth to him. We must give that problem really careful thought or we shall spoil our enjoyment. Of course, we should murder him first, but he is a tough bird. It will be difficult, but if we succeed, we could be worse even than Le Chiffre.\\n\\n \u0027For you, dear James, it is easy. You can start off by resigning. That was a brilliant thought of yours, a splendid start to your new career. And so simple. Everyone has the revolver of resignation in his pocket. All you\u0027ve got to do is pull the trigger and you will have made a big hole in your country and your conscience at the same time. A murder and a suicide with one bullet! Splendid! What a difficult and glorious profession. As for me, I must start embracing the new cause at once.\u0027\\n\\n He looked at his watch.\\n\\n \u0027Good. I\u0027ve started already. I\u0027m half an hour late for a meeting with the chief of police.\u0027\\n\\n He rose to his feet laughing.\\n\\n \u0027That was most enjoyable, my dear James. You really ought to go on the halls. Now about that little problem of yours, this business of not knowing good men from bad men and villains from heroes, and so forth. It is, of course, a difficult problem in the abstract. The secret lies in personal experience, whether you\u0027re a Chinaman or an Englishman.\u0027\\n\\n He paused at the door.\\n\\n \u0027You admit that Le Chiffre did you personal evil and that you would kill him if he appeared in front of you now?\\n\\n \u0027Well, when you get back to London you will find there are other Le Chiffres seeking to destroy you and your friends and your country. M will tell you about them. And now that you have seen a really evil man, you will know how evil they can be and you will go after them to destroy them in order to protect yourself and the people you love. You won\u0027t wait to argue about it. You know what they look like now and what they can do to people. You may be a bit more choosy about the jobs you take on. You may want to be certain that the target really is black, but there are plenty of really black targets around. There\u0027s still plenty for you to do. And you\u0027ll do it. And when you fall in love and have a mistress or a wife and children to look after, it will seem all the easier.\u0027\\n\\n Mathis opened the door and stopped on the threshold.\\n\\n \u0027Surround yourself with human beings, my dear James. They are easier to fight for than principles.\u0027\\n\\n He laughed. \u0027But don\u0027t let me down and become human, yourself. We would lose such a wonderful machine.\u0027\\n\\n With a wave of the hand he shut the door.\\n\\n \u0027Hey,\u0027 shouted Bond.\\n\\n But the footsteps went quickly off down the passage.\\n\\n CHAPTER 21 - VESPER\\n\\n It was on the next day that Bond asked to see Vesper.\\n\\n He had not wanted to see her before. He was told that every day she came to the nursing home and asked after him. Flowers had arrived from her. Bond didn\u0027t like flowers and he told the nurse to give them to another patient. After this had happened twice, no more flowers came. Bond had not meant to offend her. He disliked having feminine things around him. Flowers seemed to ask for recognition of the person who had sent them, to be constantly transmitting a message of sympathy and affection. Bond found this irksome. He disliked being cosseted. It gave him claustrophobia.\\n\\n Bond was bored at the idea of having to explain some of this to Vesper. And he was embarrassed at having to ask one or two questions which mystified him, questions about Vesper\u0027s behaviour. The answers would almost certainly make her out to be a fool. Then he had his full report to M to think about. In this he didn\u0027t want to have to criticize Vesper. It might easily cost her her job.\\n\\n But above all, he admitted to himself, he shirked the answer to a more painful question.\\n\\n The doctor had talked often to Bond about his injuries. He had always told him that there would be no evil effects from the terrible battering his body had received. He had said that Bond\u0027s full health would return and that none of his powers had been taken from him. But the evidence of Bond\u0027s eyes and his nerves refused these comforting assurances. He was still painfully swollen and bruised and whenever the injections wore off he was in agony. Above all, his imagination had suffered. For an hour in that room with Le Chiffre the certainty of impotence had been beaten into him and a scar had been left on his mind that could only be healed by experience.\\n\\n From that day when Bond first met Vesper in the Hermitage bar, he had found her desirable and he knew that if things had been different in the night-club, if Vesper had responded in any way and if there had been no kidnapping he would have tried to sleep with her that night. Even later, in the car and outside the villa when God knows he had had other things to think about, his eroticism had been hotly aroused by the sight of her indecent nakedness.\\n\\n And now when he could see her again, he was afraid. Afraid that his senses and his body would not respond to her sensual beauty. Afraid that he would feel no stir of desire and that his blood would stay cool. In his mind he had made this first meeting into a test and he was shirking the answer. That was the real reason, he admitted, why he had waited to give his body a chance to respond, why he had put off their first meeting for over a week. He would like to have put off the meeting still further, but he explained to himself that his report must be written, that any day an emissary from London would come over and want to hear the full story, that today was as good as tomorrow, that anyway he might as well know the worst.\\n\\n So on the eighth day he asked for her, for the early morning when he was feeling refreshed and strong after the night\u0027s rest.\\n\\n For no reason at all, he had expected that she would show some sign of her experiences, that she would look pale and even ill. He was not prepared for the tall bronzed girl in a cream tussore frock with a black belt who came happily through the door and stood smiling at him.\\n\\n \u0027Good heavens, Vesper,\u0027 he said with a wry gesture of welcome, \u0027you look absolutely splendid. You must thrive on disaster. How have you managed to get such a wonderful sunburn?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I feel very guilty,\u0027 she said sitting down beside him. \u0027But I\u0027ve been bathing every day while you\u0027ve been lying here. The doctor said I was to and Head of S said I was to, so, well, I just thought it wouldn\u0027t help you for me to be moping away all day long in my room. I\u0027ve found a wonderful stretch of sand down the coast and I take my lunch and go there every day with a book and I don\u0027t come back till the evening. There\u0027s a bus that takes me there and back with only a short walk over the dunes, and I\u0027ve managed to get over the fact that it\u0027s on the way down that road to the villa.\u0027\\n\\n Her voice faltered.\\n\\n The mention of the villa had made Bond\u0027s eyes flicker.\\n\\n She continued bravely, refusing to be defeated by Bond\u0027s lack of response.\\n\\n \u0027The doctor says it won\u0027t be long before you\u0027re allowed up. I thought perhaps . . . I thought perhaps I could take you down to this beach later on. The doctor says that bathing would be very good for you.\u0027\\n\\n Bond grunted.\\n\\n \u0027God knows when I\u0027ll be able to bathe,\u0027 he said. \u0027The doctor\u0027s talking through his hat. And when I can bathe it would probably be better for me to bathe alone for a bit. I don\u0027t want to frighten anybody. Apart from anything else,\u0027 he glanced pointedly down the bed, \u0027my body\u0027s a mass of scars and bruises. But you enjoy yourself. There\u0027s no reason why you shouldn\u0027t enjoy yourself.\u0027\\n\\n Vesper was stung by the bitterness and injustice in his voice.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m sorry,\u0027 she said, \u0027I just thought . . . I was just trying . . .\u0027\\n\\n Suddenly her eyes filled with tears. She swallowed.\\n\\n \u0027I wanted . . . I wanted to help you get well.\u0027\\n\\n Her voice strangled. She looked piteously at him, facing the accusation in his eyes and in his manner.\\n\\n Then she broke down and buried her face in her hands and sobbed.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m sorry,\u0027 she said in a muffled voice. \u0027I\u0027m really sorry.\u0027 With one hand she searched for a handkerchief in her bag. \u0027It\u0027s all my fault,\u0027 she dabbed at her eyes. \u0027I know it\u0027s all my fault.\u0027\\n\\n Bond at once relented. He put out a bandaged hand and laid it on her knee.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s all right, Vesper. I\u0027m sorry I was so rough. It\u0027s just that I was jealous of you in the sunshine while I\u0027m stuck here. Directly I\u0027m well enough I\u0027ll come with you and you must show me your beach. Of course it\u0027s just what I want. It\u0027ll be wonderful to get out again.\u0027\\n\\n She pressed his hand and stood up and walked over to the window. After a moment she busied herself with her make-up. Then she came back to the bed.\\n\\n Bond looked at her tenderly. Like all harsh, cold men, he was easily tipped over into sentiment. She was very beautiful and he felt warm towards her. He decided to make his questions as easy as possible.\\n\\n He gave her a cigarette and for a time they talked of the visit of Head of S and of the reactions in London to the rout of Le Chiffre. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/casino-royale-james-bond-1/page-18.html","bookId":2424,"book":{"id":2424,"title":"Casino Royale (James Bond #1)","description":"Storyline: Casino Royale (James Bond (Original Series) #1) \\n In the first of Ian Fleming\u0027s James Bond novels, 007 declares war on Le Chiffre, French communist and paymaster of the Soviet murder organization SMERSH. \\n The battle begins with a fifty-million-franc game of baccarat, gains momentum during Bond\u0027s fiery love affair with a sensuous lady spy, and reaches a chilling climax with fiendish torture at the hands of a master sadist.
