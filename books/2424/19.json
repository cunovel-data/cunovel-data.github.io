{"id":77363,"no":19,"title":"Page 19","content":"From what she said it was clear that the final object of the plan had been more than fulfilled. The story was still being splashed all over the world and correspondents of most of the English and American papers had been at Royale trying to trace the Jamaican millionaire who had defeated Le Chiffre at the tables. They had got on to Vesper, but she had covered up well. Her story was that Bond had told her he was going on to Cannes and Monte Carlo to gamble with his winnings. The hunt had moved down to the South of France. Mathis and the police had obliterated all other traces and the papers were forced to concentrate on the Strasbourg angles and the chaos in the ranks of the French Communists.\\n\\n \u0027By the way, Vesper,\u0027 said Bond after a time. \u0027What really happened to you after you left me in the night club? All I saw was the actual kidnapping.\u0027 He told her briefly of the scene outside the Casino.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m afraid I must have lost my head,\u0027 said Vesper, avoiding Bond\u0027s eyes. \u0027When I couldn\u0027t see Mathis anywhere in the entrance hall I went outside and the commissionaire asked me if I was Miss Lynd, and then told me the man who had sent in the note was waiting in a car down on the right of the steps. Somehow I wasn\u0027t particularly surprised. I\u0027d only known Mathis for a day or two and I didn\u0027t know how he worked, so I just walked down towards the car. It was away on the right and more or less in the shadows. Just as I was coming up to it, Le Chiffre\u0027s two men jumped out from behind one of the other cars in the row and simply scooped my skirt over my head.\u0027\\n\\n Vesper blushed.\\n\\n \u0027It sounds a childish trick,\u0027 she looked penitently at Bond, \u0027but it\u0027s really frightfully effective. One\u0027s a complete prisoner and although I screamed I don\u0027t expect any sound came out from under my skirt. I kicked out as hard as I could, but that was no use as I couldn\u0027t see and my arms were absolutely helpless. I was just a trussed chicken.\\n\\n They picked me up between them and shoved me into the back of the car. I went on struggling, of course, and when the car started and while they were trying to tie a rope or something round the top of my skirt over my head, I managed to get an arm free and throw my bag through the window. I hope it was some use.\u0027\\n\\n Bond nodded.\\n\\n \u0027It was rather instinctive. I just thought you\u0027d have no idea what had happened to me and I was terrified. I did the first thing I could think of.\u0027\\n\\n Bond knew that it was him they had been after and that if Vesper hadn\u0027t thrown her bag out, they would probably have thrown it out themselves directly they saw him appear on the steps.\\n\\n \u0027It certainly helped,\u0027 said Bond, \u0027but why didn\u0027t you make any sign when they finally got me after the car smash, when I spoke to you? I was dreadfully worried. I thought they might have knocked you out or something.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m afraid I must have been unconscious,\u0027 said Vesper. \u0027I fainted once from lack of air and when I came to they had cut a hole in front of my face. I must have fainted again. I don\u0027t remember much until we got to the villa. I really only gathered you had been captured when I heard you try and come after me in the passage.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And they didn\u0027t touch you?\u0027 asked Bond. \u0027They didn\u0027t try and mess about with you while I was being beaten up?\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 said Vesper. \u0027They just left me in an arm-chair. They drank and played cards - “belotte” I think it was from what I heard - and then they went to sleep. I suppose that was how SMERSH got them. They bound my legs and put me on a chair in a corner facing the wall and I saw nothing of SMERSH. I heard some odd noises. I expect they woke me up. And then what sounded like one of them falling off his chair. Then there were some soft footsteps and a door closed and then nothing happened until Mathis and the police burst in hours later. I slept most of the time. I had no idea what had happened to you, but,\u0027 she faltered, \u0027I did once hear a terrible scream. It sounded very far away. At least, I think it must have been a scream. At the time I thought it might have been a nightmare.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m afraid that must have been me,\u0027 said Bond.\\n\\n Vesper put out a hand and touched one of his. Her eyes filled with tears.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s horrible,\u0027 she said. \u0027The things they did to you. And it was all my fault. If only . . .\u0027\\n\\n She buried her face in her hands.\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s all right,\u0027 said Bond comfortingly. \u0027It\u0027s no good crying over spilt milk. It\u0027s all over now and thank heavens they let you alone.\u0027 He patted her knee. \u0027They were going to start on you when they\u0027d got me really softened up,\u0027 (softened up is good, he thought to himself). \u0027We\u0027ve got a lot to thank SMERSH for. Now, come on, let\u0027s forget about it. It certainly wasn\u0027t anything to do with you. Anybody could have fallen for that note. Anyway, it\u0027s all water over the dam,\u0027 he added cheerfully.\\n\\n Vesper looked at him gratefully through her tears. \u0027You really promise?\u0027 she asked. \u0027I thought you would never forgive me. I . . . I\u0027ll try and make it up to you. Somehow.\u0027 She looked at him.\\n\\n Somehow? thought Bond to himself. He looked at her. She was smiling at him. He smiled back.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027d better look out,\u0027 he said. \u0027I may hold you to that.\u0027\\n\\n She looked into his eyes and said nothing, but the enigmatic challenge was back. She pressed his hand and rose. \u0027A promise is a promise,\u0027 she said.\\n\\n This time they both knew what the promise was.\\n\\n She picked up her bag from the bed and walked to the door.\\n\\n \u0027Shall I come tomorrow?\u0027 She looked at Bond gravely.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, please, Vesper,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027I\u0027d like that. Please do some more exploring. It will be fun to think of what we can do when I get up. Will you think of some things?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Vesper. \u0027Please get well quickly.\u0027\\n\\n They gazed at each other for a second. Then she went out and closed the door and Bond listened until the sound of her footsteps had disappeared.\\n\\n CHAPTER 22 - THE HASTENING SALOON\\n\\n From that day Bond\u0027s recovery was rapid.\\n\\n He sat up in bed and wrote his report to M. He made light of what he still considered amateurish behaviour on the part of Vesper. By juggling with the emphasis, he made the kidnapping sound much more Machiavellian than it had been. He praised Vesper\u0027s coolness and composure throughout the whole episode without saying that he had found some of her actions unaccountable.\\n\\n Every day Vesper came to see him and he looked forward to these visits with excitement. She talked happily of her adventures of the day before, her explorations down the coast and the restaurants where she had eaten. She had made friends with the chief of police and with one of the directors of the Casino and it was they who took her out in the evening and occasionally lent her a car during the day. She kept an eye on the repairs to the Bentley which had been towed down to coachbuilders at Rouen, and she even arranged for some new clothes to be sent out from Bond\u0027s London flat. Nothing survived from his original wardrobe. Every stitch had been cut to ribbons in the search for the forty million francs.\\n\\n The Le Chiffre affair was never mentioned between them. She occasionally told Bond amusing stories of Head of S\u0027s office. She had apparently transferred there from the WRNS. And he told her of some of his adventures in the Service.\\n\\n He found he could speak to her easily and he was surprised.\\n\\n With most women his manner was a mixture of taciturnity and passion. The lengthy approaches to a seduction bored him almost as much as the subsequent mess of disentanglement. He found something grisly in the inevitability of the pattern of each affair. The conventional parabola - sentiment, the touch of the hand, the kiss, the passionate kiss, the feel of the body, the climax in the bed, then more bed, then less bed, then the boredom, the tears and the final bitterness - was to him shameful and hypocritical. Even more he shunned the mise en scŠne for each of these acts in the play - the meeting at a party, the restaurant, the taxi, his flat, her flat, then the week-end by the sea, then the flats again, then the furtive alibis and the final angry farewell on some doorstep in the rain.\\n\\n But with Vesper there could be none of this.\\n\\n In the dull room and the boredom of his treatment her presence was each day an oasis of pleasure, something to look forward to. In their talk there was nothing but companionship with a distant undertone of passion. In the background there was the unspoken zest of the promise which, in due course and in their own time, would be met. Over all there brooded the shadow of his injuries and the tantalus of their slow healing.\\n\\n Whether Bond liked it or not, the branch had already escaped his knife and was ready to burst into flower.\\n\\n With enjoyable steps Bond recovered. He was allowed up. Then he was allowed to sit in the garden. Then he could go for a short walk, then for a long drive. And then the afternoon came when the doctor appeared on a flying visit from Paris and pronounced him well again. His clothes were brought round by Vesper, farewells were exchanged with the nurses, and a hired car drove them away.\\n\\n It was three weeks from the day when he had been on the edge of death, and now it was July and the hot summer shimmered down the coast and out to sea. Bond clasped the moment to him.\\n\\n Their destination was to be a surprise for him. He had not wanted to go back to one of the big hotels in Royale and Vesper said she would find somewhere away from the town. But she insisted on being mysterious about it and only said that she had found a place he would like. He was happy to be in her hands, but he covered up his surrender by referring to their destination as \u0027Trou sur Mer\u0027 (she admitted it was by the sea), and lauding the rustic delights of outside lavatories, bed-bugs, and cockroaches.\\n\\n Their drive was spoiled by a curious incident.\\n\\n While they followed the coast road in the direction of Les Noctambules, Bond described to her his wild chase in the Bentley, finally pointing out the curve he had taken before the crash and the exact place where the vicious carpet of spikes had been laid. He slowed the car down and leant out to show her the deep cuts in the tarmac made by the rims of the wheels and the broken branches in the hedge and the patch of oil where the car had come to rest.\\n\\n But all the time she was distrait and fidgety and commented only in monosyllables. Once or twice he caught her glancing in the driving-mirror, but when he had a chance to look back through the rear window, they had just rounded a bend and he could see nothing.\\n\\n Finally he took her hand.\\n\\n \u0027Something\u0027s on your mind, Vesper,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n She gave him a taut, bright smile. \u0027It\u0027s nothing. Absolutely nothing. I had a silly idea we were being followed. It\u0027s just nerves, I suppose. This road is full of ghosts.\u0027\\n\\n Under cover of a short laugh she looked back again.\\n\\n \u0027Look.\u0027 There was an edge of panic in her voice.\\n\\n Obediently Bond turned his head. Sure enough, a quarter of a mile away, a black saloon was coming after them at a good pace.\\n\\n Bond laughed.\\n\\n \u0027We can\u0027t be the only people using this road,\u0027 he said. \u0027Anyway, who wants to follow us? We\u0027ve done nothing wrong.\u0027 He patted her hand. \u0027It\u0027s a middle-aged commercial traveller in car-polish on his way to Le Havre. He\u0027s probably thinking of his lunch and his mistress in Paris. Really, Vesper, you mustn\u0027t think evil of the innocent.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I expect you\u0027re right,\u0027 she said nervously. \u0027Anyway, we\u0027re nearly there.\u0027\\n\\n She relapsed into silence and gazed out of the window.\\n\\n Bond could still feel her tenseness. He smiled to himself at what he took to be simply a hangover from their recent adventures. But he decided to humour her and when they came to a small lane leading towards the sea and slowed to turn down it, he told the driver to stop directly they were off the main road.\\n\\n Hidden by the tall hedge, they watched together through the rear window.\\n\\n Through the quiet hum of summer noises they could hear the car approaching. Vesper dug her fingers into his arm. The pace of the car did not alter as it approached their hiding-place and they had only a brief glimpse of a man\u0027s profile as a black saloon tore by. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/casino-royale-james-bond-1/page-19.html","bookId":2424,"book":{"id":2424,"title":"Casino Royale (James Bond #1)","description":"Storyline: Casino Royale (James Bond (Original Series) #1) \\n In the first of Ian Fleming\u0027s James Bond novels, 007 declares war on Le Chiffre, French communist and paymaster of the Soviet murder organization SMERSH. \\n The battle begins with a fifty-million-franc game of baccarat, gains momentum during Bond\u0027s fiery love affair with a sensuous lady spy, and reaches a chilling climax with fiendish torture at the hands of a master sadist.
