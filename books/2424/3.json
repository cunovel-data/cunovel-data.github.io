(For details see Morgue: Section Q.) Conclusion: Every effort should be made to improve our knowledge of this very powerful organization and destroy its operatives. CHAPTER 3 - NUMBER 007 Head of S (the section of the Secret Service concerned with the Soviet Union) was so keen on his plan for the destruction of Le Chiffre, and it was basically his own plan, that he took the memorandum himself and went up to the top floor of the gloomy building overlooking Regent\u0027s Park and through the green baize door and along the corridor to the end room. He walked belligerently up to M\u0027s Chief of Staff, a young sapper who had earned his spurs as one of the secretariat to the Chiefs of Staff committee after having been wounded during a sabotage operation in 1944, and had kept his sense of humour in spite of both experiences. \u0027Now look here, Bill. I want to sell something to the Chief. Is this a good moment?\u0027 \u0027What do you think, Penny?\u0027 The Chief of Staff turned to M\u0027s private secretary who shared the room with him. Miss Moneypenny would have been desirable but for eyes which were cool and direct and quizzical. \u0027Should be all right. He won a bit of a victory at the FO this morning and he\u0027s not got anyone for the next half an hour.\u0027 She smiled encouragingly at Head of S whom she liked for himself and for the importance of his section. \u0027Well, here\u0027s the dope, Bill.\u0027 He handed over the black folder with the red star which stood for Top Secret. \u0027And for God\u0027s sake look enthusiastic when you give it him. And tell him I\u0027ll wait here and read a good code-book while he\u0027s considering it. He may want some more details, and anyway I want to see you two don\u0027t pester him with anything else until he\u0027s finished.\u0027 \u0027All right, sir.\u0027 The Chief of Staff pressed a switch leant towards the intercom on his desk. \u0027Yes?\u0027 asked a quiet, flat voice. \u0027Head of S has an urgent docket for you, sir.\u0027 There was a pause. \u0027Bring it in,\u0027 said a voice. The Chief of Staff released the switch and stood up. \u0027Thanks, Bill. I\u0027ll be next door,\u0027 said Head of S. The Chief of Staff crossed his office and went through the double doors leading into M\u0027s room. In a moment he came out and over the entrance a small blue light burned the warning that M was not to be disturbed. Later, a triumphant Head of S said to his Number Two: \u0027We nearly cooked ourselves with that last paragraph. He said it was subversion and blackmail. He got pretty sharp about it. Anyway, he approves. Says the idea\u0027s crazy, but worth trying if the Treasury will play and he thinks they will. He\u0027s going to tell them it\u0027s a better gamble than the money we\u0027re putting into deserting Russian colonels who turn double after a few months\u0027 “asylum” here. And he\u0027s longing to get at Le Chiffre, and anyway he\u0027s got the right man and wants to try him out on the job.\u0027 \u0027Who is it?\u0027 asked Number Two. \u0027One of the Double O\u0027s - I guess 007. He\u0027s tough and M thinks there may be trouble with those gunmen of Le Chiffre\u0027s. He must be pretty good with the cards or he wouldn\u0027t have sat in the Casino in Monte Carlo for two months before the war watching that Roumanian team work their stuff with the invisible ink and the dark glasses. He and the DeuxiŠme bowled them out in the end and 007 turned in a million francs he had won at shemmy. Good money in those days.\u0027 James Bond\u0027s interview with M had been short. \u0027What about it, Bond?\u0027 asked M when Bond came back into his room after reading Head of S\u0027s memorandum and after gazing for ten minutes out of the waiting-room window at the distant trees in the park. Bond looked across the desk into the shrewd, clear eyes. \u0027It\u0027s very kind of you, sir, I\u0027d like to do it. But I can\u0027t promise to win. The odds at baccarat are the best after trente-et-quarante - evens except for the tiny cagnotte - but I might get a bad run against me and get cleaned out. Play\u0027s going to he pretty high - opening\u0027ll go up to half a million, I should think.\u0027 Bond was stopped by the cold eyes. M knew all this already, knew the odds at baccarat as well as Bond. That was his job - knowing the odds at everything, and knowing men, his own and the opposition\u0027s. Bond wished he had kept quiet about his misgivings. \u0027He can have a bad run too,\u0027 said M. \u0027You\u0027ll have plenty of capital. Up to twenty-five million, the same as him. We\u0027ll start you on ten and send you another ten when you\u0027ve had a look round. You can make the extra five yourself.\u0027 He smiled. \u0027Go over a few days before the big game starts and get your hand in. Have a talk to Q about rooms and trains, and any equipment you want. The Paymaster will fix the funds. I\u0027m going to ask the DeuxiŠme to stand by. It\u0027s their territory and as it is we shall be lucky if they don\u0027t kick up rough. I\u0027ll try and persuade them to send Mathis. You seemed to get on well with him in Monte Carlo on that other Casino job. And I\u0027m going to tell Washington because of the NATO angle. CIA have got one or two good men at Fontainebleau with the joint intelligence chaps there. Anything else?\u0027 Bond shook his head. \u0027I\u0027d certainly like to have Mathis, sir.\u0027 \u0027Well, we\u0027ll see. Try and bring it off. We\u0027re going to look pretty foolish if you don\u0027t. And watch out. This sounds an amusing job, but I don\u0027t think it\u0027s going to be. Le Chiffre is a good man. Well, best of luck.\u0027 \u0027Thank you, sir,\u0027 said Bond and went to the door. \u0027Just a minute.\u0027 Bond turned. I think I\u0027ll keep you covered, Bond. Two heads are better than one and you\u0027ll need someone to run your communications. I\u0027ll think it over. They\u0027ll get in touch with you at Royale. You needn\u0027t worry. It\u0027ll be someone good.\u0027 Bond would have preferred to work alone, but one didn\u0027t argue with M. He left the room hoping that the man they sent would be loyal to him and neither stupid, nor, worse still, ambitious. CHAPTER 4 - L\u0027ENNEMI ?COUTE As two weeks later, James Bond awoke in his room at the H“tel Splendide, some of this history passed through his mind. He had arrived at Royale-les-Eaux in time for luncheon two days before. There had been no attempt to contact him and there had been no flicker of curiosity when he had signed the register \u0027James Bond, Port Maria, Jamaica\u0027. M had expressed no interest in his cover. \u0027Once you start to make a set at Le Chiffre at the tables, you\u0027ll have had it,\u0027 he said. \u0027But wear a cover that will stick with the general public.\u0027 Bond knew Jamaica well, so he asked to be controlled from there and to pass as a Jamaican plantocrat whose father had made his pile in tobacco and sugar and whose son chose to play it away on the stock markets and in casinos. If inquiries were made, he would quote Charles DaSilva of Chaffery\u0027s, Kingston, as his attorney. Charles would make the story stick. Bond had spent the last two afternoons and most of the nights at the Casino, playing complicated progression systems on the even chances at roulette. He made a high banco at chemin-de-fer whenever he heard one offered. If he lost, he would suivi once and not chase it further if he lost the second time. In this way he had made some three million francs and had given his nerves and card-sense a thorough work-out. He had got the geography of the Casino clear in his mind. Above all, he had been able to observe Le Chiffre at the tables and to note ruefully that he was a faultless and lucky gambler. Bond liked to make a good breakfast. After a cold shower, he sat at the writing-table in front of the window. He looked out at the beautiful day and consumed half a pint of iced orange juice, three scrambled eggs and bacon and a double portion of coffee without sugar. He lit his first cigarette, a Balkan and Turkish mixture made for him by Morlands of Grosvenor Street, and watched the small waves lick the long seashore and the fishing-fleet from Dieppe string out towards the June heat-haze followed by a paper-chase of herring-gulls. He was lost in his thoughts when the telephone rang. It was the concierge announcing that a Director of Radio Stentor was waiting below with the wireless set he had ordered from Paris. \u0027Of course,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027Send him up.\u0027 This was the cover fixed by the DeuxiŠme Bureau for their liaison man with Bond. Bond watched the door, hoping that it would be Mathis. When Mathis came in, a respectable business-man carrying a large square parcel by its leather handle, Bond smiled broadly and would have greeted him with warmth if Mathis had not frowned and held up his free hand after carefully closing the door. \u0027I have just arrived from Paris, monsieur, and here is the set you asked to have on approval - five valves, superhet, I think you call it in England, and you should be able to get most of the capitals of Europe from Royale. There are no mountains for forty miles in any direction.\u0027 \u0027It sounds all right,\u0027 said Bond, lifting his eyebrows at this mystery-making. Mathis paid no attention. He placed the set, which he had unwrapped, on the floor beside the unlit panel electric fire below the mantelpiece. \u0027It is just past eleven,\u0027 he said, \u0027and I see that the Compagnons de la Chanson should now be on the medium wave from Rome. They are touring Europe. Let us see what the reception is like. It should be a fair test.\u0027 He winked. Bond noticed that he had turned the volume on to full and that the red light indicating the long waveband was illuminated, though the set was still silent. Mathis fiddled at the back of the set. Suddenly an appalling roar of static filled the small room. Mathis gazed at the set for a few seconds with benevolence and then turned it off and his voice was full of dismay. \u0027My dear monsieur - forgive me please - badly tuned,\u0027 and he again bent to the dials. After a few adjustments the close harmony of the French came over the air and Mathis walked up and clapped Bond very hard on the back and wrang his hand until Bond\u0027s fingers ached. Bond smiled back at him. \u0027Now, what the hell?\u0027 he asked. \u0027My dear friend,\u0027 Mathis was delighted, \u0027you are blown, blown, blown. Up there,\u0027 he pointed at the ceiling, \u0027at this moment, either Monsieur Muntz or his alleged wife, allegedly bedridden with the grippe, is deafened, absolutely deafened, and I hope in agony.\u0027 He grinned with pleasure at Bond\u0027s frown of disbelief. Mathis sat down on the bed and ripped open a packet of Caporal with his thumbnail. Bond waited. Mathis was satisfied with the sensation his words had caused. He became serious. \u0027How it has happened I don\u0027t know. They must have been on to you for several days before you arrived. The opposition is here in real strength. Above you is the Muntz family. He is German. She is from somewhere in Central Europe, perhaps a Czech. This is an old-fashioned hotel. There are disused chimneys behind these electric fires. Just here,\u0027 he pointed a few inches above the panel fire, \u0027is suspended a very powerful radio pick-up. The wires run up the chimney to behind the Muntzes\u0027 electric fire where there is an amplifier. In their room is a wire-recorder and a pair of earphones on which the Muntzes listen in turn. That is why Madame Muntz has the grippe and takes all her meals in bed and why Monsieur Muntz has to be constantly at her side instead of enjoying the sunshine and the gambling of this delightful resort. \u0027Some of this we knew because in France we are very clever. The rest we confirmed by unscrewing your electric fire a few hours before you got here.\u0027 Suspiciously Bond walked over and examined the screws which secured the panel to the wall. Their grooves showed minute scratches. \u0027Now it is time for a little more play-acting,\u0027 said Mathis. He walked over to the radio, which was still transmitting close harmony to its audience of three, and switched it off.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/casino-royale-james-bond-1/page-3.html","bookId":2424,"book":{"id":2424,"title":"Casino Royale (James Bond #1)","description":"Storyline: Casino Royale (James Bond (Original Series) #1) In the first of Ian Fleming\u0027s James Bond novels, 007 declares war on Le Chiffre, French communist and paymaster of the Soviet murder organization SMERSH.
