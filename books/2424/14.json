He had had to take too much in the past twenty-four hours and now this last stroke by the enemy seemed almost too final. This time there could be no miracles. No one knew where he was and no one would miss him until well on into the morning. The wreck of his car would be found before very long, but it would take hours to trace the ownership to him.\n And Vesper. He looked to the right, past the thin man who was lying back with his eyes closed. His first reaction was one of scorn. Damn fool girl getting herself trussed up like a chicken, having her skirt pulled over her head as if the whole of this business was some kind of dormitory rag. But then he felt sorry for her. Her naked legs looked so childlike and defenseless.\n \u0027Vesper,\u0027 he said softly.\n There was no answer from the bundle in the corner and Bond suddenly had a chill feeling, but then she stirred slightly.\n At the same time the thin man caught him a hard backhanded blow over the heart.\n \u0027Silence.\u0027\n Bond doubled over with the pain and to shield himself from another blow, only to get a rabbit punch on the back of the neck which made him arch back again, the breath whistling through his teeth.\n The thin man had hit him a hard professional cutting blow with the edge of the hand. There was something rather deadly about his accuracy and lack of effort. He was now again lying back, his eyes closed. He was a man to make you afraid, an evil man. Bond hoped he might get a chance of killing him.\n Suddenly the boot of the car was thrown open and there was a clanking crash. Bond guessed that they had been waiting for the third man to retrieve the carpet of spiked chain-mail. He assumed it must be an adaptation of the nail-studded devices used by the Resistance against German staff-cars.\n Again he reflected on the efficiency of these people and the ingenuity of the equipment they used. Had M underestimated their resourcefulness? He stifled a desire to place the blame on London. It was he who should have known; he who should have been warned by small signs and taken infinitely more precautions. He squirmed as he thought of himself washing down champagne in the Roi Galant while the enemy was busy preparing his counter-stroke. He cursed himself and cursed the hubris which had made him so sure the battle was won and the enemy in flight.\n All this time Le Chiffre had said nothing. Directly the boot was shut, the third man, whom Bond at once recognized, climbed in beside him and Le Chiffre reversed furiously back on to the main road. Then he banged the gear lever through the gate and was soon doing seventy on down the coast.\n By now it was dawn - about five o\u0027clock, Bond guessed - and he reflected that a mile or two on was the turning to Le Chiffre\u0027s villa. He had not thought that they would take Vesper there. Now that he realized that Vesper had only been a sprat to catch a mackerel the whole picture became clear.\n It was an extremely unpleasant picture. For the first time since his capture, fear came to Bond and crawled up his spine.\n Ten minutes later the Citroâ€°n lurched to the left, ran on a hundred yards up a small side-road partly overgrown with grass and then between a pair of dilapidated stucco pillars into an unkempt forecourt surrounded by a high wall. They drew up in front of a peeling white door. Above a rusty bell-push in the door-frame, small zinc letters on a wooden base spelled out \u0027Les Noctambules\u0027 and, underneath, \u0027Sonnez SVP\u0027.\n From what Bond could see of the cement frontage, the villa was typical of the French seaside style. He could imagine the dead blue-bottles being hastily swept out for the summer let and the stale rooms briefly aired by a cleaning woman sent by the estate agent in Royale. Every five years one coat of whitewash would be slapped over the rooms and the outside woodwork, and for a few weeks the villa would present a smiling front to the world. Then the winter rains would get to work, and the imprisoned flies, and quickly the villa would take on again its abandoned look.\n But, Bond reflected, it would admirably serve Le Chiffre\u0027s purpose this morning, if he was right in assuming what that was to be. They had passed no other house since his capture and from his reconnaissance of the day before he knew there was only an occasional farm for several miles to the south.\n As he was urged out of the car with a sharp crack in the ribs from the thin man\u0027s elbow, he knew that Le Chiffre could have them both to himself, undisturbed, for several hours. Again his skin crawled.\n Le Chiffre opened the door with a key and disappeared inside. Vesper, looking incredibly indecent in the early light of day, was pushed in after him with a torrent of lewd French from the man whom Bond knew to himself as \u0027the Corsican\u0027. Bond followed without giving the thin man a chance to urge him.\n The key of the front door turned in the lock.\n Le Chiffre was standing in the doorway of a room on the right. He crooked a finger at Bond in a silent, spidery summons.\n Vesper was being led down a passage towards the back of the house. Bond suddenly decided.\n With a wild backward kick which connected with the thin man\u0027s shins and brought a whistle of pain from him he hurled himself down the passage after her. With only his feet as weapons, there was no plan in his mind except to do as much damage as possible to the two gunmen and be able to exchange a few hurried words with the girl. No other plan was possible. He just wanted to tell her not to give in.\n As the Corsican turned at the commotion Bond was on him and his right shoe was launched in a flying kick at the other man\u0027s groin.\n Like lightning the Corsican slammed himself back against the wall of the passage and, as Bond\u0027s foot whistled past his hip, he very quickly, but somehow delicately, shot out his left hand, caught Bond\u0027s shoe at the top of its arch and twisted it sharply.\n Completely off balance, Bond\u0027s other foot left the ground. In the air his whole body turned and with the momentum of his rush behind it crashed sideways and down on to the floor.\n For a moment he lay there, all the breath knocked out of him. Then the thin man came and hauled him up against the wall by his collar. He had a gun in his hand. He looked Bond inquisitively in the eyes. Then unhurriedly he bent down and swiped the barrel viciously across Bond\u0027s shins. Bond grunted and caved at the knees.\n \u0027If there is a next time, it will be across your teeth,\u0027 said the thin man in bad French.\n A door slammed. Vesper and the Corsican had disappeared. Bond turned his head to the right. Le Chiffre had moved a few feet out into the passage. He lifted his finger and crooked it again. Then for the first time he spoke.\n \u0027Come, my dear friend. We are wasting our time.\u0027\n He spoke in English with no accent. His voice was low and soft and unhurried. He showed no emotion. He might have been a doctor summoning the next patient from the waiting-room, a hysterical patient who had been expostulating feebly with a nurse.\n Bond again felt puny and impotent. Nobody but an expert in ju-jitsu could have handled him with the Corsican\u0027s economy and lack of fuss. The cold precision with which the thin man had paid him back in his own coin had been equally unhurried, even artistic.\n Almost docilely Bond walked back down the passage.\n He had nothing but a few more bruises to show for his clumsy gesture of resistance to these people.\n As he preceded the thin man over the threshold he knew that was utterly and absolutely in their power.\n CHAPTER 17 - \u0027MY DEAR BOY\u0027\n It was a large bare room, sparsely furnished in cheap French art nouveau style. It was difficult to say whether it was intended as a living- or dining-room for a flimsy-looking mirrored sideboard, sporting an orange crackle-ware fruit dish and two painted wooden candlesticks, took up most of the wall opposite the door and contradicted the faded pink sofa ranged against the other side of the room.\n There was no table in the centre under the alabasterine ceiling light, only a small square of stained carpet with a futurist design in contrasting browns.\n Over by the window was an incongruous-looking throne-like chair in carved oak with a red velvet seat, a low table on which stood an empty water carafe and two glasses, and a light arm-chair with a round cane seat and no cushion.\n Half-closed Venetian blinds obscured the view from the window, but cast bars of early sunlight over the few pieces of furniture and over part of the brightly papered wall and the brown stained floorboards.\n Le Chiffre pointed at the cane chair.\n \u0027That will do excellently,\u0027 he said to the thin man. \u0027Prepare him quickly. If he resists, damage him only a little.\u0027\n He turned to Bond. There was no expression on his large face and his round eyes were uninterested. \u0027Take off your clothes. For every effort to resist, Basil will break one of your fingers. We are serious people and your good health is of no interest to us. Whether you live or die depends on the outcome of the talk we are about to have.\u0027\n He made a gesture towards the thin man and left the room.\n The thin man\u0027s first action was a curious one. He opened the clasp-knife he had used on the hood of Bond\u0027s car, took the small arm-chair and with a swift motion he cut out its cane seat.\n Then he came back to Bond, sticking the still open knife, like a fountain-pen, in the vest pocket of his coat. He turned Bond round to the light and unwound the flex from his wrists. Then he stood quickly aside and the knife was back in his right hand.\n \u0027Vite.\u0027\n Bond stood chafing his swollen wrists and debating with himself how much time he could waste by resisting. He only delayed an instant. With a swift step and a downward sweep of his free hand, the thin man seized the collar of his dinner-jacket and dragged it down, pinning Bond\u0027s arms back. Bond made the traditional counter to this old policeman\u0027s hold by dropping down on one knee, but as he dropped the thin man dropped with him and at the same time brought his knife round and down behind Bond\u0027s back. Bond felt the back of the blade pass down his spine. There was the hiss of a sharp knife through cloth and his arms were suddenly free as the two halves of his coat fell forward.\n He cursed and stood up. The thin man was back in his previous position, his knife again at the ready in his relaxed hand. Bond let the two halves of his dinner-jacket fall off his arms on to the floor.\n \u0027Allez,\u0027 said the thin man with a faint trace of impatience. Bond looked him in the eye and then slowly started to take off his shirt.\n Le Chiffre came quietly back into the room. He carried a pot of what smelt like coffee. He put it on the small table near the window. He also placed beside it on the table two other homely objects, a three-foot-long carpet-beater in twisted cane and a carving knife.\n He settled himself comfortably on the throne-like chair and poured some of the coffee into one of the glasses. With one foot he hooked forward the small arm-chair, whose seat was now an empty circular frame of wood, until it was directly opposite him.\n Bond stood stark naked in the middle of the room, bruises showing livid on his white body, his face a grey mask of exhaustion and knowledge of what was to come.\n \u0027Sit down there.\u0027 Le Chiffre nodded at the chair in front of him.\n Bond walked over and sat down.\n The thin man produced some flex. With this he bound Bond\u0027s wrists to the arms of the chair and his ankles to the front legs. He passed a double strand across his chest, under the arm-pits and through the chair-back. He made no mistakes with the knots and left no play in any of the bindings. All of them bit sharply into Bond\u0027s flesh. The legs of the chair were broadly spaced and Bond could not even rock it.\n He was utterly a prisoner, naked and defenceless.\n His buttocks and the underpart of his body protruded through the seat of the chair towards the floor. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/casino-royale-james-bond-1/page-14.html","bookId":2424,"book":{"id":2424,"title":"Casino Royale (James Bond #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Casino Royale (James Bond (Original Series) #1) \n In the first of Ian Fleming\u0027s James Bond novels, 007 declares war on Le Chiffre, French communist and paymaster of the Soviet murder organization SMERSH. \n The battle begins with a fifty-million-franc game of baccarat, gains momentum during Bond\u0027s fiery love affair with a sensuous lady spy, and reaches a chilling climax with fiendish torture at the hands of a master sadist.
