{"id":77360,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"Bond groaned again pitifully. It was an inhuman sound. His eyes opened and he gazed dully at his torturer. Le Chiffre spoke. \u0027That is all, Bond. We will now finish with you. You understand? Not kill you, but finish with you. And then we will have in the girl and see if something can be got out of the remains of the two of you.\u0027 He reached towards the table. \u0027Say good-bye to it, Bond.\u0027 CHAPTER 18 - A CRAG-LIKE FACE It was extraordinary to hear the third voice. The hour\u0027s ritual had only demanded a duologue against the horrible noise of the torture. Bond\u0027s dimmed senses hardly took it in. Then suddenly he was half-way back to consciousness. He found he could see and hear again. He could hear the dead silence after the one quiet word from the doorway. He could see Le Chiffre\u0027s head slowly come up and the expression of blank astonishment, of innocent amazement, slowly give way to fear. \u0027Shtop,\u0027 had said the voice, quietly. Bond heard slow steps approaching behind his chair. \u0027Dhrop it,\u0027 said the voice. Bond saw Le Chiffre\u0027s hand open obediently and the knife fall with a clatter to the floor. He tried desperately to read into Le Chiffre\u0027s face what was happening behind him, but all he saw was blind incomprehension and terror. Le Chiffre\u0027s mouth worked, but only a high-pitched \u0027eek\u0027 came from it. His heavy cheeks trembled as he tried to collect enough saliva in his mouth to say something, ask something. His hands fluttered vaguely in his lap. One of them made a slight movement towards his pocket, but instantly fell back. His round staring eyes had lowered for a split second and Bond guessed there was a gun trained on him. There was a moment\u0027s silence. \u0027SMERSH.\u0027 The word came almost with a sigh. It came with a downward cadence as if nothing else had to be said. It was the final explanation. The last word of all. \u0027No,\u0027 said Le Chiffre. \u0027No. I . . .\u0027 His voice tailed off. Perhaps he was going to explain, to apologize, but what he must have seen in the other\u0027s face made it all useless. \u0027Your two men. Both dead. You are a fool and a thief and a traitor. I have been sent from the Soviet Union to eliminate you. You are fortunate that I have only time to shoot you. If it was possible, I was instructed that you should die most painfully. We cannot see the end of the trouble you have caused.\u0027 The thick voice stopped. There was silence in the room save for the rasping breath of Le Chiffre. Somewhere outside a bird began to sing and there were other small noises from the awakening countryside. The bands of sunlight were stronger and the sweat on Le Chiffre\u0027s face glistened brightly. \u0027Do you plead guilty?\u0027 Bond wrestled with his consciousness. He screwed up his eyes and tried to shake his head to clear it, but his whole nervous system was numbed and no message was transmitted to his muscles. He could just keep his focus on the great pale face in front of him and on its bulging eyes. A thin string of saliva crept from the open mouth and hung down from the chin. \u0027Yes,\u0027 said the mouth. There was a sharp \u0027phut\u0027, no louder than a bubble of air escaping from a tube of toothpaste. No other noise at all, and suddenly Le Chiffre had grown another eye, a third eye on a level with the other two, right where the thick nose started to jut out below the forehead. It was a small black eye, without eyelashes or eyebrows. For a second the three eyes looked out across the room and then the whole face seemed to slip and go down on one knee. The two outer eyes turned trembling up towards the ceiling. Then the heavy head fell sideways and the right shoulder and finally the whole upper part of the body lurched over the arm of the chair as if Le Chiffre were going to be sick. But there was only a short rattle of his heels on the ground and then no other movement. The tall back of the chair looked impassively out across the dead body in its arms. There was a faint movement behind Bond. A hand came from behind and grasped his chin and pulled it back. For a moment Bond looked up into two glittering eyes behind a narrow black mask. There was the impression of a crag-like face under a hat-brim, the collar of a fawn mackintosh. He could take in nothing more before his head was pushed down again. \u0027You are fortunate,\u0027 said the voice. \u0027I have no orders to kill you. Your life has been saved twice in one day. But you can tell your organization that SMERSH is only merciful by chance or by mistake. In your case you were saved first by chance and now by mistake, for I should have had orders to kill any foreign spies who were hanging round this traitor like flies round a dog\u0027s mess. \u0027But I shall leave you my visiting-card. You are a gambler. You play at cards. One day perhaps you will play against one of us. It would be well that you should be known as a spy.\u0027 Steps moved round to behind Bond\u0027s right shoulder. There was the click of a knife opening. An arm in some grey material came into Bond\u0027s line of vision. A broad hairy hand emerging from a dirty white shirt-cuff was holding a thin stiletto like a fountain-pen. It poised for a moment above the back of Bond\u0027s right hand, immovably bound with flex to the arm of the chair. The point of the stiletto executed three quick straight slashes. A fourth slash crossed them where they ended, just short of the knuckles. Blood in the shape of an inverted \u0027M\u0027 welled out and slowly started to drip on to the floor. The pain was nothing to what Bond was already suffering, but it was enough to plunge him again into unconsciousness. The steps moved quietly away across the room. The door was softly closed. In the silence, the cheerful small sounds of the summer\u0027s day crept through the closed window. High on the left-hand wall hung two small patches of pink light. They were reflections cast upwards from the floor by the zebra stripes of June sunshine, cast upwards from two separate pools of blood a few feet apart. As the day progressed the pink patches marched slowly along the wall. And slowly they grew larger. CHAPTER 19 - THE WHITE TENT You are about to awake when you dream that you are dreaming. During the next two days James Bond was permanently in this state without regaining consciousness. He watched the procession of his dreams go by without any effort to disturb their sequence, although many of them were terrifying and all were painful. He knew that he was in a bed and that he was lying on his back and could not move and in one of his twilight moments he thought there were people round him, but he made no effort to open his eyes and re-enter the world. He felt safer in the darkness and he hugged it to him. On the morning of the third day a bloody nightmare shook him awake, trembling and sweating. There was a hand on his forehead which he associated with his dream. He tried to lift an arm and smash it sideways into the owner of the hand, but his arms were immovable, secured to the sides of his bed. His whole body was strapped down and something like a large white coffin covered him from chest to feet and obscured his view of the end of the bed. He shouted a string of obscenities, but the effort took all his strength and the words tailed off into a sob. Tears of forlornness and self-pity welled out of his eyes. A woman\u0027s voice was speaking and the words gradually penetrated to him. It seemed to be a kind voice and it slowly came to him that he was being comforted and that this was a friend and not an enemy. He could hardly believe it. He had been so certain that he was still a captive and that the torture was about to begin again. He felt his face being softly wiped with a cool cloth which smelt of lavender and then he sank back into his dreams. When he awoke again some hours later all his terrors had gone and he felt warm and languorous. Sun was streaming into the bright room and garden sounds came through the window. In the background there was the noise of small waves on a beach. As he moved his head he heard a rustle, and a nurse who had been sitting beside his pillow rose and came into his line of vision. She was pretty and she smiled as she put her hand on his pulse. \u0027Well, I\u0027m certainly glad you\u0027ve woken up at last. I\u0027ve never heard such dreadful language in my life.\u0027 Bond smiled back at her. \u0027Where am I?\u0027 he asked and was surprised that his voice sounded firm and clear. \u0027You\u0027re in a nursing home at Royale and I\u0027ve been sent over from England to look after you. There are two of us and I\u0027m Nurse Gibson. Now just lie quiet and I\u0027ll go and tell the doctor you\u0027re awake. You\u0027ve been unconscious since they brought you in and we\u0027ve been quite worried.\u0027 Bond closed his eyes and mentally explored his body. The worst pain was in his wrists and ankles and in his right hand where the Russian had cut him. In the centre of the body there was no feeling. He assumed that he had been given a local anaesthetic. The rest of his body ached dully as if he had been beaten all over. He could feel the pressure of bandages everywhere and his unshaven neck and chin prickled against the sheets. From the feel of the bristles he knew that he must have been at least three days without shaving. That meant two since the morning of the torture. He was preparing a short list of questions in his mind when the door opened and the doctor came in followed by the nurse and in the background the dear figure of Mathis, a Mathis looking anxious behind his broad smile, who put a finger to his lips and walked on tiptoe to the window and sat down. The doctor, a Frenchman with a young and intelligent face, had been detached from his duties with the Deuxi≈†me Bureau to look after Bond\u0027s case. He came and stood beside Bond and put his hand on Bond\u0027s forehead while he looked at the temperature chart behind the bed. When he spoke he was forthright. \u0027You have a lot of questions to ask, my dear Mr Bond,\u0027 he said in excellent English, \u0027and I can tell you most of the answers. I do not want you to waste your strength, so I will give you the salient facts and then you may have a few minutes with Monsieur Mathis who wishes to obtain one or two details from you. It is really too early for this talk, but I wish to set your mind at rest so that we can proceed with the task of repairing your body without bothering too much about your mind.\u0027 Nurse Gibson pulled up a chair for the doctor and left the room. \u0027You have been here about two days,\u0027 continued the doctor. \u0027Your car was found by a farmer on the way to market in Royale and he informed the police. After some delay Monsieur Mathis heard that it was your car and he immediately went to Les Noctambules with his men. You and Le Chiffre were found and also your friend, Miss Lynd, who was unharmed and according to her account suffered no molestation. She was prostrated with shock, but is now fully recovered and is at her hotel. She has been instructed by her superiors in London to stay at Royale under your orders until you are sufficiently recovered to go back to England. \u0027Le Chiffre\u0027s two gunmen are dead, each killed by a single .35 bullet in the back of the skull. From the lack of expression on their faces, they evidently never saw or heard their assailant. They were found in the same room as Miss Lynd. Le Chiffre is dead, shot with a similar weapon between the eyes. Did you witness his death?\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027Your own injuries are serious, but your life is not in danger though you have lost a lot of blood. If all goes well, you will recover completely and none of the functions of your body will be impaired.\u0027 The doctor smiled grimly. \u0027But I fear that you will continue to be in pain for several days and it will be my endeavour to give you as much comfort as possible. Now that you have regained consciousness your arms will be freed, but you must not move your body and when you sleep the nurse has orders to secure your arms again. Above all, it is important that you rest and regain your strength. At the moment you are suffering from a grave condition of mental and physical shock.\u0027 The doctor paused. \u0027For how long were you maltreated?\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/casino-royale-james-bond-1/page-16.html","bookId":2424,"book":{"id":2424,"title":"Casino Royale (James Bond #1)","description":"Storyline: Casino Royale (James Bond (Original Series) #1) In the first of Ian Fleming\u0027s James Bond novels, 007 declares war on Le Chiffre, French communist and paymaster of the Soviet murder organization SMERSH.
