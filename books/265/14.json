{"id":8028,"no":14,"title":"CHAPTER XIII. — ROBBED IN HIS SLEEP.","content":"Arrived at his destination Mr. Brown opened a door, and bade Sam enter. It was rather dark, and it was not until his host lighted a candle, that Sam could obtain an idea of the appearance of the room. The ceiling was low, and the furniture scanty. A couple of chairs, a small table, of which the paint was worn off in spots, and a bed in the corner, were the complete outfit of Mr. Brown\u0027s home. He set the candle on the table, and remarked apologetically: \"I don\u0027t live in much style, as you see. The fact is, I am at present in straitened circumstances. When my uncle dies I shall inherit a fortune. Then, when you come to see me, I will entertain you handsomely.\" \"Is your uncle rich?\" asked Sam. \"I should say he was. He\u0027s a millionnaire.\" \"Why don\u0027t he do something for you now?\" Mr. Clarence Brown shrugged his shoulders. \"He\u0027s a very peculiar man—wants to keep every cent as long as he lives. When he\u0027s dead it\u0027s got to go to his heirs. That\u0027s why he lives in a palatial mansion on Madison Avenue, while I, his nephew, occupy a shabby apartment like this.\" Sam looked about him, and mentally admitted the justice of the term. It was a shabby apartment, without question. Still, he was to lodge there gratis, and it was not for him to complain. \"By the way,\" said Mr. Brown, casually, after exploring his pockets apparently without success, \"you haven\u0027t got a quarter, have you?\" \"Yes, I guess so.\" \"All right; I\u0027ll borrow it till to-morrow, if you don\u0027t mind.\" \"Certainly,\" said Sam, handing over the sum desired. \"I\u0027ll go out and get some whiskey. My system requires it. You won\u0027t mind being left alone for five minutes.\" \"Oh, no.\" \"Very good. I won\u0027t stay long.\" Mr. Brown went out, and our hero sat down on the bed to wait for him. \"So this is my first night in the city,\" he thought. \"I expected they had better houses. This room isn\u0027t half so nice as I had at the deacon\u0027s. But then I haven\u0027t got to hoe potatoes. I guess I\u0027ll like it when I get used to it. There isn\u0027t anybody to order me round here.\" Presently Mr. Brown came back. He had a bottle partially full of whiskey with him. \"Sorry to keep you waiting,\" he said. \"Were you lonely?\" \"Oh, no.\" \"I\u0027ve got a couple of glasses here somewhere. Oh, here they are. Now we\u0027ll see how it tastes.\" \"Not much for me,\" said Sam. \"I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll like it.\" \"It\u0027ll be good for your stomach. However, I won\u0027t give you much.\" He poured out a little in one tumbler for Sam and a considerably larger amount for himself. \"Your health,\" he said, nodding. \"Thank you,\" said Sam, Sam tasted the whiskey, but the taste did not please him. He set down the glass, but his host drained his at a draught. \"Don\u0027t you like it?\" asked Brown. \"Not very much.\" \"Don\u0027t you care to drink it?\" \"I guess not.\" \"It\u0027s a pity it should be wasted.\" To prevent this, Mr. Brown emptied Sam\u0027s glass also. \"Now, if you are not sleepy, we might have a game of cards,\" suggested Brown. \"I think I\u0027d rather go to bed,\" said Sam, yawning. \"All right! Go to bed any time. I dare say you are tired. Do you go to sleep easily?\" \"In a jiffy.\" \"Then you won\u0027t mind my absence. I\u0027ve got to make a call on a sick friend, but I shan\u0027t be out late. Just make yourself at home, go to sleep, and you\u0027ll see me in the morning.\" \"Thank you, sir.\" \"Don\u0027t bolt the door, as I don\u0027t want to wake you up when I come in.\" \"All right.\" Again Mr. Brown went out, and Sam undressed and got into bed. It was not very comfortable, and the solitary sheet looked as if it had not been changed for three months or more. However, Sam was not fastidious, and he was sleepy. So he closed his eyes, and was soon in the land of dreams. It was about two hours afterward that Clarence Brown entered the room. He walked on tiptoe to the bed, and looked at Sam. \"He\u0027s fast asleep,\" he said to himself. \"Did he undress? Oh, yes, here are his clothes. I\u0027ll take the liberty of examining his pockets, to see whether my trouble is likely to be rewarded.\" Brown explored one pocket after the other. He found no pocket-book, for Sam did not possess any. In fact he had never felt the need of one until he appropriated the deacon\u0027s money. The balance of this was tucked away in his vest-pocket. \"Six dollars and ten cents,\" said Brown, after counting it. \"It isn\u0027t much of a haul, that\u0027s a fact. I thought he had twice as much, at the least. Still,\" he added philosophically, \"it\u0027s better than nothing. I shall find a use for it without doubt.\" He tucked the money away in his own pocket, and sat on the edge of the bedstead in meditation. \"I may as well go to bed,\" he reflected. \"He won\u0027t find out his loss in the night, and in the morning I can be off before he is up. Even if I oversleep myself, I can brazen it out. He\u0027s only a green country boy. Probably he won\u0027t suspect me, and if he does he can prove nothing.\" He did not undress, but lay down on the bed dressed as he was. He, too, was soon asleep, and Sam, unconscious of his loss, slept on. So the money was doubly stolen, and the first thief suffered at the hands of a more experienced thief. The sun had been up nearly three hours the next morning before Clarence Brown awoke. As he opened his eyes, his glance fell on Sam still asleep, and the events of the evening previous came to his mind. \"I must be up, and out of this,\" he thought, \"before the young greenhorn wakes up.\" Being already dressed, with the exception of his coat, he had little to do beyond rising. He crept out of the room on tiptoe, and, making his way to a restaurant at a safe distance, sat down and ordered a good breakfast at Sam\u0027s expense. Meanwhile Sam slept on for half an hour more. Finally he opened his eyes, and, oblivious of his changed circumstances, was surprised that he had not been called earlier. But a single glance about the shabby room recalled to his memory that he was now beyond the deacon\u0027s jurisdiction. \"I am in New York,\" he reflected, with a thrill of joy. \"But where is Mr. Brown?\" He looked in vain for his companion, but no suspicion was excited in his mind. \"He didn\u0027t want to wake me up,\" he thought. \"I suppose he has gone to his business.\" He stretched himself, and lay a little longer. It was a pleasant thought that there was no stern taskmaster to force him up. He might lie as long as he wanted to, till noon, if he chose. Perhaps he might have chosen, but the claims of a healthy appetite asserted themselves, and Sam sprang out of bed. \"I\u0027ll have a good breakfast,\" he said to himself, \"and then I must look around and see if I can\u0027t find something to do; my money will soon be out.\" It was natural that he should have felt for his money, at that moment, but he did not. No suspicion of Mr. Brown\u0027s integrity had entered his mind. You see Sam was very unsophisticated at that time, and, though he had himself committed a theft, he did not suspect the honesty of others. \"I suppose I shall have to go without thanking Mr. Brown, as he don\u0027t seem to be here,\" he reflected. \"Perhaps I shall see him somewhere about the streets. I\u0027ve saved a dollar anyway, or at least seventy-five cents,\" he added, thinking of the quarter he had lent his hospitable entertainer the evening before. \"Perhaps he\u0027ll let me sleep here again to-night. It\u0027ll be a help to me, as long as I haven\u0027t got anything to do yet.\" Still Sam did not feel for his money, and was happily unconscious of his loss. He opened his door, and found his way downstairs into the street without difficulty. The halls and staircases looked even more dingy and shabby in the daytime than they had done in the evening. \"It isn\u0027t a very nice place to live,\" thought Sam. \"However, I suppose Mr. Brown will be rich when his uncle dies. I wish he was rich now; he might give me a place.\" \"Shine yer boots?\" asked a small knight of the brush. \"No,\" said Sam, who had grown economical; \"they don\u0027t need it.\" He walked on for five minutes or more. Presently he came to an eating-house. He knew it by the printed bills of fare which were placarded outside. \"Now, I\u0027ll have some breakfast,\" he thought, with satisfaction, and he entered confidently. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3016/83382.html","bookId":265,"book":{"id":265,"title":"The Young Outlaw or, Adrift in the Streets","description":"简介： The Young Outlaw is the sixth volume of the Tattered Tom Series, and the twelfth of the stories which are wholly or mainly devoted to street-life in New York.
