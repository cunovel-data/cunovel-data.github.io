{"id":8026,"no":12,"title":"CHAPTER XI. — FIRST EXPERIENCES IN THE CITY.","content":"There are few boys who do not enjoy a trip on the railroad, especially for the first time. The five hours which Sam spent on his journey gave him unqualified delight. Occasionally his attention was called off from the scenery by an exclamation from the old lady, who at every jolt thought the cars were off the track. Sam liberally patronized the apple and peanut merchant, who about once an hour walked through the cars. The crackers which he had purchased at the grocery store had not spoiled his appetite, but rather appeared to sharpen it. The old lady apparently became hungry also, for she called the apple vender to her. \"What do you ask for them apples?\" she inquired. \"The largest are three cents apiece, the smallest, two cents.\" \"That\u0027s an awful price. They aint worth half that.\" \"We can\u0027t sell \u0027em for less, and make any profit.\" \"I\u0027ll give you a cent for that one,\" she continued, pointing to the largest in the basket. \"That! Why, that\u0027s a three-center. Can\u0027t take it nohow.\" \"I\u0027ll give you three cents for them two.\" \"No, ma\u0027am, you may have \u0027em for five cents.\" \"Then I won\u0027t buy \u0027em. My darter will give me plenty for nothin\u0027.\" \"She may, but I can\u0027t.\" So the old lady heroically put away the temptation, and refused to purchase. All things must have an end, and Sam\u0027s journey was at length over. The cars entered the great depot. Sam hurried out of the cars, never giving a thought to the old lady, who expected his help in carrying out her bandboxes. He was eager to make his first acquaintance with the streets of New York. There was a crowd of hackmen in waiting, all of whom appeared to Sam to be seeing which could talk fastest. \"Have a carriage, sir? Take you to any hotel.\" One of them got hold of Sam by the arms, and attempted to lead him to his carriage. \"Hold on a minute, mister,\" said Sam, drawing back. \"Where are you goin\u0027 to take me?\" \"Anywhere you say. Astor House, St. Nicholas, or any other.\" \"Is it far?\" \"About five miles,\" said the hackman, glibly. \"How much are you goin to charge?\" \"Only three dollars.\" \"Three dollars!\" repeated Sam, in amazement. He had less than seven dollars now, and, though he was not particularly provident, he knew that it would never do to spend almost half his slender stock of money for cab-hire. \"Never mind,\" said he. \"I\u0027ll walk.\" \"You can\u0027t; it\u0027s too far,\" said the hackman, eager for a fare. \"I\u0027ll try.\" So Sam walked out of the depot, and walked away. He didn\u0027t know exactly where to go, and thought he would follow a man with a carpet-bag who appeared to know his way. This man unconsciously guided him to Broadway. Sam realized, from the stately character of the buildings, that he was in an important street, and, cutting loose from his guide, walked down towards the City Hall Park. It seemed to him like a dream; these beautiful warehouses, showy stores, and the moving throng, which never seemed to grow less, surprised him also. Though he knew in advance that New York must be very different from the little country town which, until now, had been his home, he was not prepared for so great a difference, and wandered on, his mouth and eyes wide open. At last he reached the City Hall Park, and, catching sight of a bench on which one or two persons were already sitting, Sam, feeling tired with his walk, entered the Park, and sat down too. \"Black yer boots?\" inquired a dirty-faced boy, with a box slung over his shoulders. Sam looked at his shoes, begrimed with a long country walk, and hesitated. \"What do you ask?\" he said. \"It\u0027s worth a quarter to black them shoes,\" said the boy, swinging them critically. \"Then I can\u0027t afford it,\" \"Twenty cents.\" \"No,\" said Sam. \"I\u0027ve got to earn my own living, and I can\u0027t afford it. Is blackin\u0027 boots a good business?\" \"Some days it is, but if it comes rainy, it isn\u0027t. I\u0027ll give you a bully shine for ten cents.\" \"Will you show me afterwards where I can get some dinner cheap?\" asked Sam, who was still hungry. \"Yes,\" said the boot-black. \"I know a tip-top place.\" \"Is it far off?\" \"Right round in Chatham street—only a minute\u0027s walk.\" \"All right. Go ahead. I\u0027ll give you ten cents.\" Sam felt that he was paying his money not only for the actual service done, but for valuable information besides. On the whole, though he knew he must be economical, it seemed to him a paying investment. \"Did you come from the country?\" asked the young knight of the blacking-brush, while he was vigorously brushing the first shoe. \"Yes,\" said Sam. \"I only got here just now.\" \"That\u0027s what I thought.\" \"Why?\" \"Because you look like a greenhorn.\" \"Do you mean to insult me?\" asked Sam, nettled. \"No,\" said the other; \"only if you\u0027ve never been here before of course you\u0027re green.\" \"I won\u0027t be long,\" said Sam, hastily. \"Course you won\u0027t, \u0027specially if you have me to show you round.\" \"Have you lived long in New York?\" inquired Sam. \"I was born here,\" said the boy. \"Have you been long blackin\u0027 boots?\" \"Ever since I was knee-high to a door-step.\" \"Then you make a living at it?\" \"I don\u0027t starve. What made you leave the country?\" \"I got tired of working on a farm.\" \"Did you have enough to eat?\" \"Yes.\" \"And a good bed to sleep in?\" \"Yes.\" \"Then you\u0027d ought to have stayed there,\" said the boot-black. \"I think I shall like the city better,\" said Sam. \"There\u0027s a good deal more goin\u0027 on.\" \"I\u0027d like to try the country. You don\u0027t live at the West, do you?\" \"No.\" \"Lots of boys goes West. Maybe I\u0027ll go there, some time.\" \"Is it a good place?\" \"That\u0027s what they say. The boys gets good homes out there on farms.\" \"Then I don\u0027t want to go,\" said Sam. \"I\u0027m tired of farmin\u0027.\" By this time the shoes were polished. \"Aint that a bully shine?\" asked the boot-black, surveying his work with satisfaction. \"Yes,\" said Sam. \"You know how to do it.\" \"Course I do. Now where\u0027s the stamps?\" Sam drew out ten cents, and handed to the boy. \"Now show me where I can get some dinner.\" \"All right. Come along!\" and the boy, slinging his box over his shoulder, led the way to a small place on Chatham street. It was in a basement, and did not look over-neat; but Sam was too hungry to be particular, and the odor of the cooking was very grateful to him. \"I guess I\u0027ll get a plate o\u0027 meat, too,\" said the boot-black. \"I aint had anything since breakfast.\" They sat down side by side at a table, and Sam looked over the bill of fare. He finally ordered a plate of roast beef, for ten cents, and his companion followed his example. The plates were brought, accompanied by a triangular wedge of bread, and a small amount of mashed potato. It was not a feast for an epicure, but both Sam and his companion appeared to enjoy it. Sam was still hungry. \"They didn\u0027t bring much,\" he said. \"I guess I\u0027ll have another plate.\" \"I aint got stamps enough,\" said his companion. \"If you want another plate, I\u0027ll pay for it,\" said Sam, with a sudden impulse of generosity. \"Will you? You\u0027re a brick!\" said the boot-black heartily. \"Then I don\u0027t mind. I\u0027ll have another.\" \"Do they have any pie?\" asked Sam. \"Course they do.\" \"Then I\u0027ll have a piece afterwards.\" He did not offer to treat his companion to pie, for he realized that his stock of money was not inexhaustible. This did not appear to be expected, however, and the two parted on very good terms, when the dinner was over. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3016/83380.html","bookId":265,"book":{"id":265,"title":"The Young Outlaw or, Adrift in the Streets","description":"简介： The Young Outlaw is the sixth volume of the Tattered Tom Series, and the twelfth of the stories which are wholly or mainly devoted to street-life in New York.
