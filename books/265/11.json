{"id":8025,"no":11,"title":"CHAPTER X. — SAM\u0027S ADVENTURES AT THE DEPOT.","content":"It was six miles to the station at Wendell, where Sam proposed to take the cars for New York. He had to travel on an empty stomach, and naturally got ravenously hungry before he reached his destination. About half a mile this side of the depot he passed a grocery-store, and it occurred to him that he might get something to eat there. Entering he saw a young man in his shirt-sleeves engaged in sweeping. \"Have you got anything good to eat?\" asked Sam. \"This aint a hotel,\" said the young man, taking Sam for a penniless adventurer. \"I knew that before,\" said Sam, \"but haven\u0027t you got some crackers or something, to stay a feller\u0027s stomach?\" \"Haven\u0027t you had any breakfast?\" asked the clerk, curiously. \"No.\" \"Don\u0027t they give you breakfast where you live?\" \"Not so early in the morning. You see I had to take an early start, \u0027cause I\u0027m goin\u0027 to attend my grandmother\u0027s funeral.\" This of course was a story trumped up for the occasion. \"We\u0027ve got some raw potatoes,\" said the clerk, grinning. \"I\u0027ve had enough to do with potatoes,\" said Sam. \"Haven\u0027t you got some crackers?\" \"Come to think of it, we have. How many will you have?\" \"About a dozen.\" While they were being put up in a paper bag, the clerk inquired, \"How far off does your grandmother live?\" \"About twenty miles from here, on the railroad,\" answered Sam, who didn\u0027t care to mention that he was bound for New York. \"Warwick, I suppose.\" \"Yes,\" said Sam, at a venture. \"How soon does the train start?\" \"In about half an hour. Hold on, though; that\u0027s the New York train, and don\u0027t stop at Warwick.\" \"I guess I\u0027ll be goin,\" said Sam, hurriedly. \"Where\u0027s the depot?\" \"Half a mile straight ahead, but you needn\u0027t hurry. The train for Warwick don\u0027t go till ten.\" \"Never mind. I want to see the New York train start;\" and Sam hurried off eating crackers as he walked. \"I\u0027m glad the train starts so quick,\" thought Sam. \"I don\u0027t want to wait round here long. I might meet somebody that knows me.\" He had no difficulty in finding the depot. It was a plain building, about twenty by thirty feet, with a piazza on the side towards the track. He entered, and going up to the ticket-office asked for a ticket to New York. \"For yourself?\" asked the station-master. \"Yes,\" said Sam. \"How old are you?\" \"Twelve.\" \"Then you\u0027ll have to pay for a whole ticket. Three dollars.\" \"All right,\" said Sam, promptly, and he drew out a five-dollar bill, receiving in return two dollars and a ticket. \"Do you live in New York, sonny?\" asked the station-master. \"No, I\u0027m only goin to see my aunt,\" answered Sam, with another impromptu falsehood. \"I know something about New York. In what street does your aunt live?\" Sam was posed, for he did not know the name of even one street in the city he was going to. \"I don\u0027t exactly remember,\" he was forced to admit. \"Then how do you expect to find her if you don\u0027t know where she lives?\" \"Oh, she\u0027ll meet me at the depot,\" said Sam, readily. \"Suppose she don\u0027t?\" \"I\u0027ll find her somehow. But she\u0027s sure to meet me.\" \"Going to stay long in the city?\" \"I hope so. Perhaps my aunt\u0027ll adopt me. How soon will the train be along?\" \"In about fifteen minutes.\" Here an old lady came up, and asked for a ticket to New York. \"Three dollars, ma\u0027am.\" \"Three dollars! Can\u0027t you take less?\" asked the old lady, fumbling in her pocket for her purse. \"No ma\u0027am, the price is fixed.\" \"It\u0027s a sight of money. Seems throwed away, too, jest for travellin\u0027. You haint got anything to show for it. I never was to York in my life.\" \"Please hurry, ma\u0027am, there are others waiting.\" \"Massy sakes, don\u0027t be so hasty! There\u0027s the money.\" \"And there\u0027s your ticket.\" \"I wish I know\u0027d somebody goin to New York. I\u0027m afeared to travel alone.\" \"There\u0027s a boy going,\" said the station-master, pointing to Sam. \"Are you goin to York?\" asked the old lady, peering over her spectacles at Sam. \"Yes, ma\u0027am.\" \"Was you ever there afore?\" \"No, ma\u0027am.\" \"Aint your folks afeared to have you go alone?\" \"Oh, no, they don\u0027t mind.\" \"I wish you was older, so\u0027s you could look after me.\" Sam was rather flattered by the idea of having a lady under his charge, and said, \"I\u0027ll take care of you, if you want me to.\" \"Will you? That\u0027s a good boy. What\u0027s your name?\" \"Sam Barker,\" answered our hero, with some hesitation, not feeling sure whether it was politic to mention his real name. \"Do you live in New York?\" \"No, ma\u0027am; but I\u0027m goin to.\" \"When will the cars git along?\" \"In about ten minutes.\" \"You\u0027ll help me get in, won\u0027t you? I\u0027ve got two bandboxes, and I don\u0027t know how to manage.\" \"Yes, ma\u0027am, I\u0027ll help you. I\u0027m goin out on the platform, but I\u0027ll come in when the cars come along.\" Sam went out on the platform, and watched eagerly for the approach of the cars. Up they came, thundering along the track, and Sam rushed into the depot in excitement. \"Come along, ma\u0027am,\" he said. \"The cars are here.\" The old lady was in a flutter of excitement also. She seized one bandbox, and Sam the other, and they hurried out on the platform. They were just climbing up the steps, when the conductor asked, \"Where are you going?\" \"To York, of course.\" \"Then this isn\u0027t the train. It is going in the opposite direction.\" \"Lawful suz!\" ejaculated the old lady in dismay. \"What made you tell me wrong, you bad boy?\" and she glared at him reproachfully over her glasses. \"How should I know?\" said Sam, rather abashed. \"I didn\u0027t know about no other train.\" \"You come near makin\u0027 me go wrong.\" \"I can\u0027t help it. It would be just as bad for me.\" \"When does the train go to York, somebody?\" asked the old lady, looking about her in a general way. \"Next train; comes round in about five minutes.\" Sam helped the old lady back into the depot, rather ashamed of the mistake he had made. He saw that she had lost some of her confidence in him, and it mortified him somewhat. It was nearly ten minutes afterwards,—for the train was late, before the right cars came up. Sam dashed into the depot again, and seized a bandboX. — \"Here\u0027s the cars. Come along,\" he said. \"I won\u0027t stir a step till I know if it\u0027s the right cars,\" said the old lady firmly. \"Then you may stay here,\" said Sam. \"I\u0027m goin\u0027.\" \"Don\u0027t leave your grandmother,\" said a gentleman, standing by. \"She isn\u0027t my grandmother. Isn\u0027t this the train to New York?\" \"Yes.\" Sam seized the bandbox once more, and this time the old lady followed him. They got into the cars without difficulty, and the old lady breathed a sigh of relief. Sam took a seat at the window just behind her, and his heart bounded with exultation as he reflected that in a few hours he would be in the great city, of which he had such vague and wonderful ideas. The only drawback to his enjoyment was the loss of his usual morning meal. The crackers helped to fill him up, but they were a poor substitute for the warm breakfast to which he had been accustomed at the deacon\u0027s. Still Sam did not wish himself back. Indeed, as he thought of the deacon\u0027s bewilderment on discovering his disappearance, he broke into an involuntary laugh. \"What are you laffin\u0027 at?\" asked the old lady, suspiciously. Sam answered, \"I was thinkin\u0027 how near we came to bein\u0027 carried off to the wrong place.\" \"That aint anything to laff at,\" said the old lady, grimly. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3016/83379.html","bookId":265,"book":{"id":265,"title":"The Young Outlaw or, Adrift in the Streets","description":"简介： The Young Outlaw is the sixth volume of the Tattered Tom Series, and the twelfth of the stories which are wholly or mainly devoted to street-life in New York.
