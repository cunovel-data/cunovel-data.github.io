{"id":8017,"no":3,"title":"CHAPTER II. — SAM\u0027S EARLY LIFE.","content":"Three years before the meeting described in the previous chapter Sam Barker became an orphan, by the death of his father. The father was an intemperate man, and no one grieved much for his death. Sam felt rather relieved than otherwise. He had received many a beating from his father, in his fits of drunken fury, and had been obliged to forage for himself for the most part, getting a meal from one neighbor, a basket of provision from another, and so managed to eke out a precarious subsistence in the tumble-down shanty which he and his father occupied. Mr. Barker left no will, for the good and sufficient reason that he had no property to dispose of. So, on the day after the funeral, Sam found himself a candidate for the poorhouse. He was a stout boy of twelve, strong and sturdy in spite of insufficient food, and certainly had suffered nothing from luxurious living. It was a country town in Connecticut, near the Rhode Island border. We will call it Dudley. The selectmen deliberated what should be done with Sam. \"There isn\u0027t much for a lad like him to do at the poorhouse,\" said Major Stebbins. \"He\u0027d ought to be set to work. Why don\u0027t you take him, Deacon Hopkins?\" \"I do need a boy,\" said the deacon, \"but I\u0027m most afeard to take Sam. He\u0027s a dreadful mischievous boy, I\u0027ve heerd.\" \"He\u0027s had a bad example in his father,\" said the major. \"You could train him up the way he\u0027d ought to go.\" \"Mebbe I could,\" said the deacon, flattered by this tribute, and reflecting, moreover, that he could get a good deal of work out of Sam without being obliged to pay him wages. \"You could train him up to be a respectable man,\" said the major. \"They wouldn\u0027t know what to do with him at the poorhouse.\" So the deacon was prevailed upon to take Sam to bring up. \"You\u0027re goin to live with me, Samuel,\" said the deacon, calling the boy to his side. \"Am I?\" asked Sam, surveying the old man attentively. \"Yes; I shall try to make a man of you.\" \"I\u0027ll get to be a man anyway, if I live long enough,\" said Sam. \"I mean I will make a man of you in a moral sense,\" explained the deacon. This, however, was above Sam\u0027s comprehension. \"What would you like to do when you\u0027re a man?\" asked the deacon. \"Smoke a pipe,\" answered Sam, after some reflection. The deacon held up his hands in horror. \"What a misguided youth!\" he exclaimed. \"Can you think of nothing better than to smoke a pipe?\" \"Dad liked it,\" said Sam; \"but I guess he liked rum better.\" \"Your father was a misguided man,\" said the deacon. \"He wasted his substance in riotous living.\" \"You\u0027d ought to have seen him when he was tight,\" said Sam, confidentially. \"Didn\u0027t he tear round then? He\u0027d fling sticks of wood at my head. O jolly! Didn\u0027t I run? I used to hide under the bed when I couldn\u0027t run out of doors.\" \"Your father\u0027s dead and gone. I don\u0027t want to talk against him, but I hope you\u0027ll grow up a very different man. Do you think you will like to live with me?\" \"I guess so,\" said Sam. \"You live in a good house, where the rain don\u0027t leak through the roof on your head. You\u0027ll give me lots to eat, too; won\u0027t you?\" \"You shall have enough,\" said the deacon, cautiously, \"but it is bad to over-eat. Boys ought to be moderate.\" \"I didn\u0027t over-eat to home,\" said Sam. \"I went one day without eatin\u0027 a crumb.\" \"You shall have enough to eat at my house, but you must render a return.\" \"What\u0027s that?\" \"You must pay me for it.\" \"I can\u0027t; I aint got a cent.\" \"You shall pay me in work. He that does not work shall not eat.\" \"Have I got to work very hard?\" asked Sam, anxiously. \"I will not task you beyond your strength, but I shall expect you to work faithfully. I work myself. Everybody works in my house.\" Sam was occupied for a brief space in considering the great problem that connects labor and eating. Somehow it didn\u0027t seem quite satisfactory. \"I wish I was a pig!\" he burst out, rather unexpectedly. \"Why?\" demanded the deacon, amazed. \"Pigs have a better time than men and boys. They have all they can eat, and don\u0027t have to work for it nuther.\" \"I\u0027m surprised at you,\" said the deacon, shocked. \"Pigs are only brute animals. They have no souls. Would you be willing to give up your immortal soul for the sake of bein\u0027 idle, and doin\u0027 no work?\" \"I don\u0027t know anything bout my immortal soul. What good does it do me?\" inquired Sam. \"I declare! the boy\u0027s actilly gropin\u0027 in heathen darkness,\" said the deacon, beginning to think he had undertaken a tough job. \"What\u0027s that?\" asked Sam, mystified. \"I haven\u0027t time to tell you now, but I must have a long talk with you some day. You aint had no sort of bringing up. Do you ever read the Bible?\" \"No, but I\u0027ve read the life of Cap\u0027n Kidd. He was a smart man, though.\" \"Captain Kidd, the pirate?\" asked the deacon, horrified. \"Yes. Wa\u0027n\u0027t he a great man?\" \"He calls a pirate a great man!\" groaned the deacon. \"I think I\u0027d like to be a pirate,\" said Sam, admiringly. \"Then you\u0027d die on the gallus!\" exclaimed the deacon with energy. \"No, I wouldn\u0027t. I wouldn\u0027t let \u0027em catch me,\" said Sam, confidently. \"I never heerd a boy talk so,\" said the deacon. \"He\u0027s as bad as a—a Hottentot.\" Deacon Hopkins had no very clear ideas as to the moral or physical condition of Hottentots, or where they lived, but had a general notion that they were in a benighted state, and the comparison seemed to him a good one. Not so to Sam. \"You\u0027re calling me names,\" he said, discontentedly. \"You called me a Hottentot.\" \"I fear you are very much like those poor, benighted creatures, Samuel,\" said his new guardian; \"but it isn\u0027t wholly your fault. You have never had any religious or moral instruction. This must be rectified. I shall buy you a catechism this very day.\" \"Will you?\" asked Sam, eagerly, who, it must be explained, had an idea that a catechism was something good to eat. \"Yes, I\u0027ll stop at the store and get one.\" They went into Pendleton\u0027s store,—a general country variety store, in which the most dissimilar articles were kept for sale. \"Have you got a catechism?\" asked the deacon, entering with Sam at his side. \"We\u0027ve got just one left.\" \"How much is it?\" \"Ten cents.\" \"I\u0027ll take it.\" Sam looked on with interest till the clerk produced the article; then his countenance underwent a change. \"Why, it\u0027s a book,\" he said. \"Of course it is. It is a very good book, from which you will learn all about your duty, and your religious obligations.\" \"You needn\u0027t buy it. I don\u0027t want it,\" said Sam. \"Don\u0027t want the catechism!\" said the deacon, not without anger. \"No, it aint any good.\" \"My boy, I know better what is good for you than you do. I shall buy you the catechism.\" \"I\u0027d rather you\u0027d get me that book,\" said Sam, pointing to a thin pamphlet copy of \"Jack, the Giant-Killer.\" But Deacon Hopkins persisted in making the purchase proposed. \"Are there any pictures in it?\" asked Sam. \"No.\" \"Then I shan\u0027t like it.\" \"You don\u0027t know what is for your good. I hope you will be wiser in time. But here we are at the house. Come right in, and mind you wipe your feet.\" This was Sam\u0027s first introduction into the Hopkins\u0027 household. He proved a disturbing element, as we shall presently see. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3016/83371.html","bookId":265,"book":{"id":265,"title":"The Young Outlaw or, Adrift in the Streets","description":"简介： The Young Outlaw is the sixth volume of the Tattered Tom Series, and the twelfth of the stories which are wholly or mainly devoted to street-life in New York.
