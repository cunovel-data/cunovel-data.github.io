{"id":8020,"no":6,"title":"CHAPTER V. — SAM COMBINES BUSINESS WITH PLEASURE.","content":"\"You came down after that pie,\" she said, turning upon Sam.. \"What pie?\" asked Sam, looking guilty, however. \"Don\u0027t ask me. You know well enough. You couldn\u0027t find it in the dark, and that\u0027s the way you came to make such a noise. Ten of my nice plates broken, too! What do you say to that, Deacon Hopkins?\" \"Samuel,\" said the deacon, \"did you do this wicked thing?\" A moment\u0027s reflection convinced Sam that it would be idle to deny it longer. The proofs of his guilt were too strong. He might have plead in his defence \"emotional insanity,\" but he was not familiar with the course of justice in New York. He was, however, fertile in expedients, and thought of the next best thing. \"Mebbe I walked in my sleep,\" he admitted. \"Did you ever walk in your sleep?\" asked the deacon, hastily. \"Lots of times,\" said Sam. \"It is rather strange you should go to the closet in your sleep,\" said Mrs. Hopkins, suspiciously. \"I suppose, if you\u0027d found it, you\u0027d have eaten it in your sleep.\" \"Likely I should,\" said Sam. \"I was dreamin\u0027 of the pie. You know how to make pie, Mrs. Hopkins; I never tasted so good before.\" Mrs. Hopkins was not a soft woman, but she was proud of her cooking, and accessible to flattery on that subject. Sam could not have defended himself better. \"That may be,\" she said, \"about your walking in your sleep; but once is enough. Hereafter I\u0027ll lock your door on the outside. I can\u0027t be waked up every night, nor I can\u0027t have my plates broken.\" \"S\u0027pose the house should catch fire,\" suggested Sam, who didn\u0027t fancy being locked up in his room. \"If it does, I\u0027ll come and let you out. The house is safer when you\u0027re safe in bed.\" \"My wife is right, Samuel,\" said the deacon, recovering his dignity now that his fears were removed. \"You must be locked in after to-night.\" Sam did not reply. On the whole, he felt glad to get off so well, after alarming the house so seriously. \"Do you mean to stay downstairs all night, Deacon Hopkins?\" demanded his wife, with uncalled-for asperity. \"If so, I shall leave you to yourself.\" \"I\u0027m ready to go up when you are,\" said her husband. \"I thought you mightn\u0027t feel like stayin\u0027 down here alone.\" \"Much protection you\u0027d be in time of danger, Mr. Hopkins,—you that locked the door on your wife, because you was afraid!\" \"I wasn\u0027t thinkin\u0027,\" stammered the deacon. \"Probably not,\" said his wife, in an incredulous tone. \"Now go up. It\u0027s high time we were all in bed again.\" Sam was not called at as early an hour as the deacon intended. The worthy man, in consequence of his slumbers being interrupted, overslept himself, and it was seven o\u0027clock when he called Sam. \"Get up, Samuel,\" he said; \"it\u0027s dreadful late, and you must be spry, or you won\u0027t catch up with the work.\" Work, however, was not prominent in Sam\u0027s mind, as his answer showed. \"Is breakfast ready?\" he asked, rubbing his eyes. \"It\u0027s most ready. Get right up, for it\u0027s time to go to work.\" \"I \u0027spose we\u0027ll have breakfast first,\" said Sam. \"If it\u0027s ready.\" Under these circumstances, Sam did not hurry. He did not care to work before breakfast, nor, for that matter, afterwards, if he could help it. So he made a leisurely, though not an elaborate toilet, and did not come down till Mrs. Hopkins called sharply up the attic stairs, \"Come down, you Sam!\" \"All right, ma\u0027am, I\u0027m comin\u0027,\" said Sam, who judged rightly that breakfast was ready. \"We shan\u0027t often let you sleep so late,\" said Mrs. Hopkins, who sat behind the waiter. \"We were broken of our rest through your cutting up last night, and so we overslept ourselves.\" \"It\u0027s pretty early,\" said Sam. \"We\u0027d ought to have been at work in the field an hour ago,\" said the deacon. At the table Sam found work that suited him better. \"You\u0027ve got a good appetite,\" said Mrs. Hopkins, as Sam took the seventh slice of bread. \"I most generally have,\" said Sam, with his mouth full. \"That\u0027s encouraging, I\u0027m sure,\" said Mrs. Hopkins, drily. There was no pie on the table, as Sam noticed, to his regret. However, he was pretty full when he rose from the table. \"Now, Samuel, you may come along with me,\" said the deacon, putting on his hat. Sam followed him out to the barn, where, in one corner, were kept the hoes, rakes, and other farming implements in use. \"Here\u0027s a hoe for you,\" said the deacon. \"What are we going to do?\" asked Sam. \"The potatoes need hoeing. Did you ever hoe potatoes?\" \"No.\" \"You\u0027ll l\u0027arn. It aint hard.\" The field was some, little distance from the house,—a two-acre lot wholly devoted to potatoes. \"I guess we\u0027ll begin at the further corner,\" said the deacon. \"Come along.\" When they had reached the part of the field specified, the deacon stopped. \"Now,\" said he, \"just see how I do it;\" and he carefully hoed around one of the hills. \"There, you see it\u0027s easy.\" \"I guess I can do it. Are you goin to stay here?\" \"No, I\u0027ve got to go to the village, to the blacksmith\u0027s. I\u0027ll be back in about two hours. Jest hoe right along that row, and then come back again on the next. Do you understand?\" \"Yes,\" said Sam. \"I want you to work as spry as you can, so\u0027s to make up for lost time.\" \"What time do you have dinner?\" asked our hero. \"You aint hungry so quick, be you?\" \"No, but I shall be bimeby. I thought I\u0027d like to know when to quit work, and go to dinner.\" \"I\u0027ll be back before that. You needn\u0027t worry about that.\" The deacon turned, and directed his steps homeward. As long as he was in sight Sam worked with tolerable speed. But when the tall and stooping figure had disappeared from view he rested, and looked around him. \"It\u0027ll be a sight of work to hoe all them potatoes,\" he said to himself. \"I wonder if the old man expects me to do the whole. It\u0027ll be a tough job.\" Sam leisurely hoed another hill. \"It\u0027s gettin\u0027 hot,\" he said. \"Why don\u0027t they have trees to give shade? Then it would be more comfortable.\" He hoed another hill, taking a little longer time. \"I guess there must be a million hills,\" he reflected, looking around him thoughtfully. \"It\u0027ll take me from now till next winter to hoe \u0027em all.\" At the rate Sam was working, his calculation of the time it would take him was not far out probably. He finished another hill. Just then a cat, out on a morning walk, chanced to pass through the field a few rods away. Now Sam could never see a cat without wanting to chase it,—a fact which would have led the cat, had she been aware of it, to give him a wide berth. But, unluckily, Sam saw her. \"Scat!\" he exclaimed, and, grasping his hoe, he ran after puss. The cat took alarm, and, climbing the wall which separated the potato-field from the next, sped over it in terror. Sam followed with whoops and yells, which served to accelerate her speed. Occasionally he picked up a stone, and threw at her, and once he threw the hoe in the excitement of his chase. But four legs proved more than a match for two, and finally he was obliged to give it up, but not till he had run more than quarter of a mile. He sat down to rest on a rock, and soon another boy came up, with a fishing-pole over his shoulder. \"What are you doing, Sam?\" he asked. \"I\u0027ve been chasin\u0027 a cat,\" said Sam. \"Didn\u0027t catch her, did you?\" \"No, hang it.\" \"Where\u0027d you get that hoe?\" \"I\u0027m to work for Deacon Hopkins. He\u0027s took me. Where are you goin?\" \"A-fishing.\" \"I wish I could go.\" \"So do I. I\u0027d like company.\" \"Where are you goin to fish?\" \"In a brook close by, down at the bottom of this field.\" \"I\u0027ll go and look on a minute or two. I guess there isn\u0027t any hurry about them potatoes.\" The minute or two lengthened to an hour and a half, when Sam roused himself from his idle mood, and shouldering his hoe started for the field where he had been set to work. It was full time. The deacon was there before him, surveying with angry look the half-dozen hills, which were all that his young assistant had thus far hoed. \"Now there\u0027ll be a fuss,\" thought Sam, and he was not far out in that calculation.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3016/83374.html","bookId":265,"book":{"id":265,"title":"The Young Outlaw or, Adrift in the Streets","description":"简介： The Young Outlaw is the sixth volume of the Tattered Tom Series, and the twelfth of the stories which are wholly or mainly devoted to street-life in New York.
