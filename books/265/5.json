{"id":8019,"no":5,"title":"CHAPTER IV. — SAM FRIGHTENS THE HOUSEHOLD.","content":"Sam usually slept the whole night through; but to-night was an exception. It might have been because he was in a strange bed, and in a strange house. At any rate, he woke in time to hear the clock on the church, of which his guardian was deacon, strike two. \"Where am I?\" was his first thought. He remembered almost immediately, and the thought made him broad awake. He ought not to have been hungry at that hour, and in fact he was not, but the thought of the pie forced itself upon his mind, and he felt a longing for the slice that was left over from supper. Quick upon this thought came another, \"Why couldn\u0027t he creep downstairs softly, and get it? The deacon and his wife were fast asleep, Who would find him out?\" A boy better brought up than Sam might have reflected that it was wrong; but, as the deacon said, Sam had no \"conceptions of duty,\" or, more properly, his conscience was not very active. He got out of bed, slipped on his stockings, and crept softly downstairs, feeling his way. It was very dark, for the entries were unlighted, but finally he reached the kitchen without creating any alarm. Now for the closet. It was not locked, and Sam opened the door without difficulty. \"I wish I had a match, so\u0027s to see where the pie is,\" he thought. He felt around, but the pie must have been placed elsewhere, for he could not find it. It had really been placed on the highest shelf, which Sam had not as yet explored. But there are dangers in feeling around in the dark. Our hero managed to dislodge a pile of plates, which fell with a crash upon his feet. There was a loud crash of broken crockery, and the noise was increased by the howls of Sam, who danced up and down with pain. The noise reached the chamber where the deacon and his wife were calmly reposing. Mrs. Hopkins was a light sleeper, and was awakened at once. She was startled and terrified, and, sitting up in bed, shook her husband violently by the shoulder. \"Deacon—Deacon Hopkins!\" she exclaimed. \"What\u0027s the matter?\" asked the deacon, drowsily. \"Matter enough. There\u0027s robbers downstairs.\" Now the deacon was broad awake. \"Robbers!\" he exclaimed. \"Pooh! Nonsense! You\u0027re dreamin\u0027, wife.\" Just then there was another racket. Sam, in trying to effect his escape, tumbled over a chair, and there was a yell of pain. \"Am I dreaming now, deacon?\" demanded his wife, triumphantly. \"You\u0027re right, wife,\" said the deacon, turning pale, and trembling. \"It\u0027s an awful situation. What shall we do?\" \"Do? Go downstairs, and confront the villains!\" returned his wife, energetically. \"They might shoot me,\" said her husband, panic-stricken. \"They\u0027re—they\u0027re said to be very desperate fellows.\" \"Are you a man, and won\u0027t defend your property?\" exclaimed his wife, taunting him, \"Do you want me to go down?\" \"Perhaps you\u0027d better,\" said the deacon, accepting the suggestion with alacrity. \"What!\" shrieked Mrs. Hopkins. \"You are willing they should shoot me?\" \"They wouldn\u0027t shoot a woman,\" said the deacon. But his wife was not appeased. Just then the unlucky Sam trod on the tail of the cat, who was quietly asleep on the hearth. With the instinct of self-defence, she scratched his leg, which was undefended by the customary clothing, and our hero, who did not feel at all heroic in the dark, not knowing what had got hold of him, roared with pain and fright. \"This is terrible!\" gasped the deacon. \"Martha, is the door locked?\" \"No.\" \"Then I\u0027ll get up and lock it. O Lord, what will become of us?\" Sam was now ascending the stairs, and, though he tried to walk softly, the stairs creaked beneath his weight. \"They\u0027re comin\u0027 upstairs,\" exclaimed Mrs. Hopkins. \"Lock the door quick, deacon, or we shall be murdered in our bed.\" The deacon reached the door in less time than he would have accomplished the same feat in the daytime, and hurriedly locked it. \"It\u0027s locked, Martha,\" he said, \"but they may break it down.\" \"Or fire through the door—\" \"Let\u0027s hide under the bed,\" suggested the heroic deacon. \"Don\u0027t speak so loud. They\u0027ll hear. I wish it was mornin\u0027.\" The deacon stood at the door listening, and made a discovery. \"They\u0027re goin up into the garret,\" he announced. \"That\u0027s strange—\" \"What do they want up there, I wonder?\" \"They can\u0027t think we\u0027ve got anything valuable up there.\" \"Deacon,\" burst out Mrs. Hopkins, with a sudden idea, \"I believe we\u0027ve been fooled.\" \"Fooled! What do you mean?\" \"I believe it isn\u0027t robbers.\" \"Not robbers? Why, you told me it was,\" said her husband, bewildered. \"I believe it\u0027s that boy.\" \"What,—Sam?\" \"Yes.\" \"What would he want downstairs?\" \"I don\u0027t know, but it\u0027s him, I\u0027ll be bound. Light the lamp, deacon, and go up and see.\" \"But it might be robbers,\" objected the deacon, in alarm. \"They might get hold of me, and kill me.\" \"I didn\u0027t think you were such a coward, Mr. Hopkins,\" said his wife, contemptuously. When she indulged in severe sarcasm, she was accustomed to omit her husband\u0027s title. \"I aint a coward, but I don\u0027t want to risk my life. It\u0027s a clear flyin\u0027 in the face of Providence. You\u0027d ought to see that it is, Martha,\" said the deacon, reproachfully. \"I don\u0027t see it. I see that you are frightened, that\u0027s what I see. Light the lamp, and I\u0027ll go up myself.\" \"Well, Martha, it\u0027s better for you to go. They won\u0027t touch a woman.\" He lighted the lamp, and his wife departed on her errand. It might have been an unconscious action on the part of the deacon, but he locked the door after his wife. Mrs. Hopkins proceeded to the door of Sam\u0027s bed-chamber, and, as the door was unfastened, she entered. Of course he was still awake, but he pretended to be asleep. \"Sam,\" said Mrs. Hopkins. There was a counterfeited snore. \"Sam—say!\" Sam took no notice. The lady took him by the shoulder, and shook him with no gentle hand, so that our hero was compelled to rouse himself. \"What\u0027s up?\" he asked, rubbing his eyes in apparent surprise. \"I am,\" said Mrs. Hopkins, shortly, \"and you have been.\" \"I!\" protested Sam, innocently. \"Why, I was sound asleep when you came in. I don\u0027t know what\u0027s been goin on. Is it time to get up?\" \"What have you been doing downstairs?\" demanded Mrs. Hopkins, sternly. \"Who says I\u0027ve been downstairs?\" asked Sam. \"I\u0027m sure you have. I heard you.\" \"It must have been somebody else.\" \"There is no one else to go down. Neither the deacon nor myself has been down.\" \"Likely it\u0027s thieves.\" But Mrs. Hopkins felt convinced, from Sam\u0027s manner, that he was the offender, and she determined to make him confess it. \"Get up,\" she said, \"and go down with me.\" \"I\u0027m sleepy,\" objected Sam. \"So am I, but I mean to find out all about this matter.\" Sam jumped out of bed, and unwillingly accompanied Mrs. Hopkins downstairs. The latter stopped at her own chamber-door, and tried to open it. \"Who\u0027s there?\" asked the deacon, tremulously. \"I am,\" said his wife, emphatically. \"So you locked the door on your wife, did you, because you thought there was danger. It does you great credit, upon my word.\" \"What have you found out?\" asked her husband, evading the reproach. \"Was it Sam that made all the noise?\" \"How could I,\" said Sam, \"when I was fast asleep?\" \"I\u0027m goin to take him down with me to see what mischief\u0027s done,\" said Mrs. Hopkins. \"Do you want to go too?\" The deacon, after a little hesitation, followed his more courageous spouse, at a safe distance, however,—and the three entered the kitchen, which had been the scene of Sam\u0027s noisy exploits. It showed traces of his presence in an overturned chair. Moreover, the closet-door was wide open, and broken pieces of crockery were scattered over the floor. A light dawned upon Mrs. Hopkins. She had solved the mystery! \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3016/83373.html","bookId":265,"book":{"id":265,"title":"The Young Outlaw or, Adrift in the Streets","description":"简介： The Young Outlaw is the sixth volume of the Tattered Tom Series, and the twelfth of the stories which are wholly or mainly devoted to street-life in New York.
