{"id":8039,"no":25,"title":"CHAPTER XXIV. — SAM\u0027S EXCUSES.","content":"Sam was not used to liquor, and was more easily affected than most. When he got out into the street his head spun round, and he staggered. His companion observed it. \"Why, you don\u0027t mean ter say yer tight, Sam?\" he said, pausing and looking at him. \"I don\u0027t know what it is,\" said Sam, \"but I feel queer.\" \"Kinder light in the head, and shaky in the legs?\" \"Yes, that\u0027s the way I feel.\" \"Then you\u0027re drunk.\" \"Drunk!\" ejaculated Sam, rather frightened, for he was still unsophisticated compared with his companion. \"Just so. I say, you must be a chicken to get tight on one whiskey-punch,\" added Jim, rather contemptuously. \"It was strong,\" said Sam, by way of apology, leaning against a lamp-post for support. \"It was stiffish,\" said Jim. \"I always take \u0027em so.\" \"And don\u0027t you feel it at all?\" queried Sam. \"Not a bit,\" said Jim, decidedly. \"I aint a baby.\" \"Nor I either,\" said Sam, with a spark of his accustomed spirit. \"Only I aint used to it.\" \"Why, I could take three glasses, one after the other, without gettin\u0027 tight,\" said Jim, proudly. \"I tell you, I\u0027ve got a strong stomach.\" \"I wish I hadn\u0027t taken the drink,\" said Sam. \"When will I feel better?\" \"In an hour or two.\" \"I can\u0027t go back to the doctor this way. He\u0027ll know I\u0027ve been drinkin\u0027. I wish I could lie down somewhere.\" \"I\u0027ll tell you what. Come round to the ferry-room. You can sit down there till you feel better.\" \"Give me your arm, Jim. I\u0027m light-headed.\" With Jim\u0027s assistance Sam made his way to Fulton Ferry, but instead of going over in the next boat he leaned back in his seat in the waiting-room, and rested. Jim walked about on the pier, his hands in his pocket, with an independent air. He felt happy and prosperous. Never before in his life, probably, had he had so much money in his possession. Some men with a hundred thousand dollars would have felt poorer than Jim with nine dollars and a half. By and by Sam felt enough better to start on his homeward journey. Jim agreed to accompany him as far as the New York side. \"I don\u0027t know what the doctor will say when he finds out the money is gone,\" said Sam, soberly. \"You just tell him it was stolen from you by a pickpocket.\" \"Suppose he don\u0027t believe it?\" \"He can\u0027t prove nothin\u0027.\" \"He might search me.\" \"So he might,\" said Jim. \"I\u0027ll tell you what you\u0027d better do.\" \"What?\" \"Just give me the money to keep for you. Then if he searches you, he won\u0027t find it.\" If Jim expected this suggestion to be adopted, he undervalued Sam\u0027s shrewdness. That young man had not knocked about the streets eight months for nothing. \"I guess not,\" said Sam, significantly. \"Maybe I wouldn\u0027t find it any easier if you took it.\" \"You don\u0027t call me a thief, do you?\" demanded Jim, offended. \"It looks as if we was both thieves,\" said Sam, candidly. \"You needn\u0027t talk so loud,\" said Jim, hurriedly. \"There\u0027s no use in tellin\u0027 everybody that I see. I don\u0027t want the money, only, if the old man finds it, don\u0027t blame me.\" \"You needn\u0027t be mad, Jim,\" said Sam. \"I\u0027ll need the money myself. I guess I\u0027ll have to hide it.\" \"Do you wear stockin\u0027s?\" asked Jim. \"Yes; don\u0027t you?\" \"Not in warm weather. They aint no good. They only get dirty. But if you wear \u0027em, that\u0027s the place to hide the money.\" \"I guess you\u0027re right,\" said Sam. \"I wouldn\u0027t have thought of it. Where can I do it?\" \"Wait till we\u0027re on the New York side. You can sit down on one of the piers and do it. Nobody\u0027ll see you.\" Sam thought this good advice, and decided to follow it. \"There is some use in stockin\u0027s,\" said Jim, reflectively. \"If I was in your place, I wouldn\u0027t know where to stow away the money. Where are you goin\u0027 now?\" \"I\u0027ll have to go back,\" said Sam. \"I\u0027ve been a long time already.\" \"I\u0027m goin to get some dinner,\" said Jim. \"I haven\u0027t got time,\" said Sam. \"Besides, I don\u0027t feel so hungry as usual. I guess it\u0027s the drink I took.\" \"It don\u0027t take away my appetite,\" said his companion, with an air of superiority. Sam took the cars home. Knowing what he did, it was with an uncomfortable feeling that he ascended the stairs and entered the presence of Dr. Graham. The doctor looked angry. \"What made you so long?\" he demanded abruptly. \"Did you find the house?\" \"No,\" answered Sam, wishing that his embarrassing explanations were fully over. \"No, I didn\u0027t.\" \"You didn\u0027t find the house!\" exclaimed the doctor, in angry surprise. \"Why didn\u0027t you?\" \"I thought it wasn\u0027t any use,\" stammered Sam. \"Wasn\u0027t any use!\" repeated the chiropodist. \"Explain yourself, sir, at once.\" \"As long as I hadn\u0027t got the letter,\" proceeded Sam. Now the secret was out. \"What did you do with the letter?\" demanded Dr. Graham, suspiciously. \"I lost it.\" \"Lost it! How could you lose it? Did you know there was money in it?\" said his employer, looking angry and disturbed. \"Yes, sir; you said so.\" \"Then why were you not careful of it, you young rascal?\" \"I was, sir; that is, I tried to be. But it was stolen.\" \"Who would steal the letter unless he knew that it contained money?\" \"That\u0027s it, sir. I ought not to have told anybody.\" \"Sit down, and tell me all about it, or it will be the worse for you,\" said the doctor. \"Now for it!\" thought Sam. \"You see, sir,\" he commenced, \"I was in the horse-cars in Brooklyn, when I saw a boy I knew. We got to talking, and, before I knew it, I told him that I was carryin\u0027 a letter with money in it. I took it out of my coat-pocket, and showed it to him.\" \"You had no business to do it,\" said Dr. Graham. \"No one but a fool would show a money-letter. So the boy stole it, did he?\" \"Oh, no,\" said Sam, hastily. \"It wasn\u0027t he.\" \"Who was it, then? Don\u0027t be all day telling your story,\" said the doctor, irritably. \"There was a young man sitting on the other side of me,\" said Sam. \"He was well-dressed, and I didn\u0027t think he\u0027d do such a thing; but he must have stole the letter.\" \"What makes you think so?\" \"He got out only two or three minutes afterwards, and it wasn\u0027t long after that that I missed the letter.\" \"What did you do?\" \"I stopped the car, and went back. Jim went back along with me. We looked all round, tryin\u0027 to find the man, but we couldn\u0027t.\" \"Of course you couldn\u0027t,\" growled the doctor. \"Did you think he would stay till you came up?\" \"No, sir. That is, I didn\u0027t know what to think. I felt so bad about losing the money,\" said Sam, artfully. Now this story was on the whole very well got up. It did not do credit to Sam\u0027s principles, but it did do credit to his powers of invention. It might be true. There are such men as pickpockets to be found riding in our city horse-cars, as possibly some of my readers may have occasion to know. As yet Dr. Graham did not doubt the story of his young assistant. Sam came very near getting off scot-free. \"But for your carelessness this money would not have been lost,\" said his employer. \"You ought to make up the loss to me.\" \"I haven\u0027t got any money,\" said Sam. A sudden thought came to Dr. Graham. \"Empty your pockets,\" he said. \"How lucky I put the bills in my stocking!\" thought Sam. He turned out his pockets, disclosing fifty cents. It was Friday, and to-morrow his weekly wages would come due. \"That\u0027s all I\u0027ve got,\" he said. \"Twenty dollars is five weeks salary,\" said Dr. Graham. \"You ought to work for me five weeks without pay.\" \"I\u0027d starve to death,\" said Sam, in alarm. \"I wouldn\u0027t be able to buy anything to eat.\" \"I can keep back part of your salary, then,\" said his employer. \"It is only proper that you should suffer for your negligence.\" At this moment a friend of the doctor\u0027s entered the office. \"What is the matter?\" he asked. Dr. Graham explained briefly. \"Perhaps,\" said the visitor, \"I can throw some light upon your loss.\" \"You! How?\" \"I happened to be coming over from Brooklyn an hour since on the same boat with that young man there,\" he said, quietly. Sam turned pale. There was something in the speaker\u0027s tone that frightened him. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3016/83393.html","bookId":265,"book":{"id":265,"title":"The Young Outlaw or, Adrift in the Streets","description":"简介： The Young Outlaw is the sixth volume of the Tattered Tom Series, and the twelfth of the stories which are wholly or mainly devoted to street-life in New York.
