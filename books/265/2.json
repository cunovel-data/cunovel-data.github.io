{"id":8016,"no":2,"title":"CHAPTER I. — THE YOUNG OUTLAW.","content":"\"Boy, is this Canal Street?\" The speaker was evidently from the country. He was a tall man, with prominent features, and a face seamed and wrinkled by the passage of nearly seventy years. He wore a rusty cloak, in the style of thirty years gone by, and his clothing generally was of a fashion seldom seen on Broadway. The boy addressed was leaning against a lamppost, with both hands in his pockets. His clothes were soiled and ragged, a soft hat, which looked as if it had served in its varied career as a foot-ball, was thrust carelessly on his head. He looked like a genuine representative of the \"street Arab,\" with no thought for to-morrow and its needs, and contented if he could only make sure of a square meal to-day. His face was dirty, and marked by a mingled expression of fun and impudence; but the features were not unpleasing, and, had he been clean and neatly dressed, he would undoubtedly have been considered good-looking. He turned quickly on being addressed, and started perceptibly, as his glance met the inquiring look of the tall, stranger. He seemed at first disposed to run away, but this intention was succeeded by a desire to have some fun with the old man. \"Canal Street\u0027s about a mile off. I\u0027ll show yer the way for ten cents.\" \"A mile off? That\u0027s strange,\" said the old man, puzzled. \"They told me at the Astor House it was only about ten minutes walk, straight up.\" \"That\u0027s where you got sold, gov\u0027nor. Give me ten cents, and you won\u0027t have no more trouble.\" \"Are you sure you know Canal Street, yourself?\" said the old man, perplexed. \"They\u0027d ought to know at the hotel.\" \"I\u0027d ought to know too. That\u0027s where my store is.\" \"Your store!\" ejaculated the old man, fixing his eyes upon his ragged companion, who certainly looked very little like a New York merchant. \"In course. Don\u0027t I keep a cigar store at No. 95?\" \"I hope you don\u0027t smoke yourself,\" said the deacon (for he was a deacon), solemnly. \"Yes, I do. My constitushun requires it.\" \"My boy, you are doing a lasting injury to your health,\" said the old man, impressively. \"Oh, I\u0027m tough. I kin stand it. Better give me a dime, and let me show yer the way.\" The deacon was in a hurry to get to Canal Street, and after some hesitation, for he was fond of money, he drew out ten cents, and handed it to his ragged companion. \"There, my boy, show me the way. I should think you might have done it for nothing.\" \"That aint the way we do business in the city, gov\u0027nor.\" \"Well, go ahead, I\u0027m in a hurry.\" \"You needn\u0027t be, for this is Canal Street,\" said the boy, edging off a little. \"Then you\u0027ve swindled me,\" said the deacon, wrathfully. \"Give me back that ten cents.\" \"Not if I know it,\" said the boy, mockingly. \"That aint the way we do business in the city. I\u0027m goin to buy two five-cent cigars with that money.\" \"You said you kept a cigar-store yourself,\" said the deacon, with sudden recollection. \"You mustn\u0027t believe all you hear, gov\u0027nor,\" said the boy, laughing saucily. \"Well now, if you aint a bad boy,\" said the old man. \"What\u0027s the odds as long as you\u0027re happy?\" said the young Arab, carelessly. Here was a good chance for a moral lesson, and the deacon felt that it was his duty to point out to the young reprobate the error of his ways. \"My young friend,\" he said, \"how can you expect to be happy when you lie and cheat? Such men are never happy.\" \"Aint they though? You bet I\u0027ll be happy when I\u0027m smokin\u0027 the two cigars I\u0027m goin to buy.\" \"Keep the money, but don\u0027t buy the cigars,\" said the deacon, religion getting the better of his love of money. \"Buy yourself some clothes. You appear to need them.\" \"Buy clo\u0027es with ten cents!\" repeated the boy, humorously. \"At any rate, devote the money to a useful purpose, and I shall not mind being cheated out of it. If you keep on this way, you\u0027ll end in the gallus.\" \"That\u0027s comin\u0027 it rather strong, gov\u0027nor. Hangin\u0027s played out in New York. I guess I\u0027m all right.\" \"I\u0027m afraid you\u0027re all wrong, my boy. You\u0027re travellin\u0027 to destruction.\" \"Let\u0027s change the subject,\" said the street boy. \"You\u0027re gittin\u0027 personal, and I don\u0027t like personal remarks. What\u0027ll you bet I can\u0027t tell your name?\" \"Bet!\" ejaculated the deacon, horrified. \"Yes, gov\u0027nor. I\u0027ll bet you a quarter I kin tell your name.\" \"I never bet. It\u0027s wicked,\" said the old man, with emphasis. \"Well, we won\u0027t bet, then,\" said the boy. \"Only, if I tell your name right, you give me ten cents. If I don\u0027t get it right, I\u0027ll give back this dime you gave me. Aint that fair?\" The deacon might have been led to suspect that there was not much difference between the boy\u0027s proposal, and the iniquity of a bet, but his mind was rather possessed by the thought that here was a good chance to recover the money out of which he had been so adroitly cheated. Surely there was no wrong in recovering that, as of course he would do, for how could a ragged street boy tell the name of one who lived a hundred and fifty miles distant, in a small country town? \"I\u0027ll do it,\" said the deacon. \"You\u0027ll give me ten cents if I tell your name?\" \"Yes, and you\u0027ll give me back the money I give you if you can\u0027t tell.\" \"That\u0027s it, gov\u0027nor.\" \"Then what\u0027s my name, my boy?\" and the deacon extended his hand in readiness to receive the forfeit of a wrong answer. \"Deacon John Hopkins,\" answered the boy, confidently. The effect on the old man was startling. He was never more surprised in his life. He stared at the boy open-mouthed, in bewilderment and wonder. \"Well, I declare!\" he ejaculated. \"I never heard of such a thing.\" \"Aint I right, gov\u0027nor?\" \"Yes, my boy, you\u0027re right; but how on earth did you find out?\" \"Give me the money, and I\u0027ll tell you;\" and the boy extended his hand. The deacon drew the money from his vest-pocket, and handed it to the young Arab, without remonstrance. \"Now tell me, my boy, how you know\u0027d me.\" The boy edged off a few feet, then lifted his venerable hat so as to display the whole of his face. \"I\u0027d ought to know you, deacon,\" he said; \"I\u0027m Sam Barker.\" \"By gracious, if it aint Sam!\" ejaculated the old man. \"Hallo! stop, I say!\" But Sam was half-way across the street. The deacon hesitated an instant, and then dashed after him, his long cloak floating in the wind, and his hat unconsciously pushed back on the top of his head. \"Stop, you Sam!\" he shouted. But Sam, with his head over his shoulder, already three rods in advance, grinned provokingly, but appeared to have no intention of stopping. The deacon was not used to running, nor did he make due allowance for the difficulty of navigating the crowded streets of the metropolis. He dashed headlong into an apple-stand, and suffered disastrous shipwreck. The apple-stand was overturned, the deacon\u0027s hat flew off, and he found himself sprawling on the sidewalk, with apples rolling in all directions around him, and an angry dame showering maledictions upon him, and demanding compensation for damages. The deacon picked himself up, bruised and ashamed, recovered his hat, which had rolled into a mud-puddle, and was forced to pay the woman a dollar before he could get away. When this matter was settled, he looked for Sam, but the boy was out of sight. In fact, he was just around the corner, laughing as if he would split. He had seen his pursuer\u0027s discomfiture, and regarded it as a huge practical joke. \"I never had such fun in all my life,\" he ejaculated, with difficulty, and he went off into a fresh convulsion. \"The old feller won\u0027t forget me in a hurry.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3016/83370.html","bookId":265,"book":{"id":265,"title":"The Young Outlaw or, Adrift in the Streets","description":"简介： The Young Outlaw is the sixth volume of the Tattered Tom Series, and the twelfth of the stories which are wholly or mainly devoted to street-life in New York.
