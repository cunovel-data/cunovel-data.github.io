{"id":8023,"no":9,"title":"CHAPTER VIII. — SAM\u0027S TEMPTATION.","content":"A month passed, a month which it is safe to say was neither satisfactory to Sam nor his employer. The deacon discovered that the boy needed constant watching. When he was left to himself, he was sure to shirk his work, and indulge his natural love of living at ease. His appetite showed no signs of decrease, and the deacon was led to remark that \"Samuel had the stiddyest appetite of any boy he ever knew. He never seemed to know when he had eaten enough.\" As for Mrs. Hopkins, Sam failed to produce a favorable impression upon her. He was by no means her ideal of a boy, though it must be added that this ideal was so high that few living boys could expect to attain it. He must have an old head on young shoulders, and in fact be an angel in all respects except the wings. On these Mrs. Hopkins probably would not insist. Being only a boy, and considerably lazier and more mischievous than the average, there was not much prospect of Sam\u0027s satisfying her requirements. \"You\u0027d better send him to the poorhouse, deacon.\" she said more than once. \"He\u0027s the most shif\u0027less boy I ever see, and it\u0027s awful the amount he eats.\" \"I guess I\u0027ll try him a leetle longer,\" said the deacon. \"He aint had no sort of bringin\u0027 up, you know.\" So at the end of four weeks Sam still continued a member of the deacon\u0027s household. As for Sam, things were not wholly satisfactory to him. In spite of all his adroit evasions of duty, he found himself obliged to work more than he found agreeable. He didn\u0027t see the fun of trudging after the deacon up and down the fields in the warm summer days. Even his meals did not yield unmingled satisfaction, as he had learned from experience that Mrs. Hopkins did not approve of giving him a second slice of pie, and in other cases interfered to check the complete gratification of his appetite, alleging that it wasn\u0027t good for boys to eat too much. Sam took a different view of the matter, and felt that if he was willing to take the consequences, he ought to be allowed to eat as much as he pleased. He was not troubled with the catechism any more. The deacon found him so stolid and unteachable that he was forced to give up in despair, and Sam became master of his own time in the evening. He usually strayed into the village, where he found company at the village store. Here it was that he met a youth who was destined to exercise an important influence upon his career. This was Ben Barker, who had for a few months filled a position in a small retail store in New York city. Coming home, he found himself a great man. Country boys have generally a great curiosity about life in the great cities, and are eager to interview any one who can give them authentic details concerning it. For this reason Ben found himself much sought after by the village boys, and gave dazzling descriptions of life in the metropolis, about which he professed to be fully informed. Among his interested listeners was Sam, whose travels had been limited by a very narrow circle, but who, like the majority of boys, was possessed by a strong desire to see the world. \"I suppose there as many as a thousand houses in New York,\" he said to Ben. \"A thousand!\" repeated Ben, in derision. \"There\u0027s a million!\" \"Honest?\" \"Yes, they reach for miles and miles. There\u0027s about twenty thousand streets.\" \"It must be awfully big. I\u0027d like to go there.\" \"Oh, you!\" said Ben, contemptuously. \"It wouldn\u0027t do for you to go there.\" \"Why not?\" \"You couldn\u0027t get along nohow.\" \"I\u0027d like to know why not?\" said Sam, rather nettled at this depreciation. \"Oh, you\u0027re a country greenhorn. You\u0027d get taken in right and left.\" \"I don\u0027t believe I would,\" said Sam. \"I aint as green as you think.\" \"You\u0027d better stay with the deacon, and hoe potatoes,\" said Ben, disparagingly. \"It takes a smart fellow to succeed in New York.\" \"Is that the reason you had to come home?\" retorted Sam. \"I\u0027m going back pretty soon,\" said Ben. \"I shan\u0027t stay long in such a one-horse place as this.\" \"Is it far to New York?\" asked Sam, thoughtfully. \"Over a hundred miles.\" \"Does it cost much to go there?\" \"Three dollars by the cars.\" \"That isn\u0027t so very much.\" \"No, but you\u0027ve got to pay your expenses when you get there.\" \"I could work.\" \"What could you do? You might, perhaps, black boots in the City Hall Park.\" \"What pay do boys get for doing that?\" asked Sam, seriously. \"Sometimes five cents, sometimes ten.\" \"I\u0027d like it better than farmin\u0027!\" \"It might do for you,\" said Ben, turning up his nose. \"What were you doing when you were in New York, Ben?\" \"I was chief salesman in a dry goods store,\" said Ben, with an air of importance. \"Was it a good place?\" \"Of course it was, or I wouldn\u0027t have stayed there.\" \"What made you leave it?\" \"I had so much care and responsibility that the doctor told me I must have rest. When the boss was away, I run the store all alone.\" There was no one to contradict Ben\u0027s confident assertions, and though some doubt was entertained by his listener none was expressed. Considering Ben\u0027s large claims, it was surprising that his services were not sought by leading New York firms, but, then, merit is not always appreciated at once. That was Ben\u0027s way of accounting for it. Sam was never tired of asking Ben fresh questions about New York. His imagination had been inflamed by the glowing descriptions of the latter, and he was anxious to pass through a similar experience. In fact, he was slowly making up his mind to leave the deacon, and set out for the brilliant Paradise which so dazzled his youthful fancy. There was one drawback, however, and that a serious one,—the lack of funds. Though the deacon supplied him with board, and would doubtless keep him in wearing apparel, there was no hint or intimation of any further compensation for his services, and Sam\u0027s whole available money capital at this moment amounted to only three cents. Now three cents would purchase three sticks of candy, and Sam intended to appropriate them in this way, but they formed a slender fund for travelling expenses; and the worst of it was that Sam knew of no possible way of increasing them. If his journey depended upon that, it would be indefinitely postponed. But circumstances favored his bold design, as we shall see. One evening as Sam was returning from the store, a man from a neighboring town, who was driving by, reined up his horse, and said, \"You live with Deacon Hopkins, don\u0027t you?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Are you going home now?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Then I\u0027ll hand you a note for him. Will you think to give it to him?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"I would stop myself, but I haven\u0027t time this evening.\" \"All right. I\u0027ll give it to him.\" \"Take good care of it, for there\u0027s money in it,\" said the man, as he passed it to the boy. Money in it! This attracted Sam\u0027s attention, and excited his curiosity. \"I wonder how much there is in it,\" he thought to himself. \"I wish it was mine. I could go to New York to-morrow if I only had it.\" With this thought prominent in his mind, Sam entered the house. Mrs. Hopkins was at the table knitting, but the deacon was not to be seen. \"Where is the deacon?\" asked Sam. \"He\u0027s gone to bed,\" said Mrs. Hopkins. \"Did you want to see him?\" \"No,\" said Sam, slowly. \"It\u0027s time you were abed too, Sam,\" said the lady. \"You\u0027re out too late, as I was tellin\u0027 the deacon to-night. Boys like you ought to be abed at eight o\u0027clock instead of settin\u0027 up half the night.\" \"I guess I\u0027ll go to bed now,\" said Sam, taking a lamp from the table. \"You\u0027d better, and mind you get up early in the mornin\u0027.\" Sam did not answer, for he was busy thinking. He went upstairs, fastened his door inside, and taking out the letter surveyed the outside critically. The envelope was not very securely fastened and came open. Sam could not resist the temptation presented, and drew out the inclosure. His face flushed with excitement, as he spread out two five-dollar bills on the table before him. \"Ten dollars!\" ejaculated Sam. \"What a lot of money! If it was only mine, I\u0027d have enough to go to New York.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3016/83377.html","bookId":265,"book":{"id":265,"title":"The Young Outlaw or, Adrift in the Streets","description":"简介： The Young Outlaw is the sixth volume of the Tattered Tom Series, and the twelfth of the stories which are wholly or mainly devoted to street-life in New York.
