{"id":8033,"no":19,"title":"CHAPTER XVIII. — SAM TURNS IMPOSTOR.","content":"Tim conducted our hero to an alley-way, not far from the North river, in which an old wagon had come to temporary anchor. \"This is my hotel,\" he said. \"I like it cause it\u0027s cheap. They don\u0027t trouble you with no bills here. Tumble in.\" Tim, without further ceremony, laid himself down on the floor of the wagon, and Sam followed his example. There is everything in getting used to things, and that is where Tim had the advantage. He did not mind the hardness of his couch, while Sam, who had always been accustomed to a regular bed, did. He moved from one side to another, and then lay on his back, seeking sleep in vain. \"What\u0027s up?\" muttered Tim, sleepily. \"Why don\u0027t you shut your peepers?\" \"The boards are awful hard,\" Sam complained. \"It aint nothin\u0027 when you\u0027re used to it,\" said Tim. \"You go to sleep, and you won\u0027t mind it.\" \"I wish I could,\" said Sam, turning again. Finally he succeeded in getting to sleep, but not till some time after his companion. He slept pretty well, however, and did not awaken till, at six o\u0027clock, he was shaken by his companion. \"What\u0027s the matter? Where am I?\" asked Sam, feeling bewildered at first. \"Why, here you are, in course,\" said the matter-of-fact Tim. \"Did you think you was in the station-house?\" \"No, I hope not,\" answered Sam. \"What time is it?\" \"I don\u0027t know. A chap stole my watch in the night. I guess it\u0027s after six. Have you got any stamps?\" \"No.\" \"Nor I. We\u0027ve got to stir round, and earn some breakfast.\" \"How\u0027ll we do it?\" \"We\u0027ll go down to the pier, and wait for the Boston boat. Maybe we\u0027ll get a chance to smash some baggage.\" \"I hope so,\" said Sam, \"for I\u0027m hungry.\" \"I\u0027m troubled that way myself,\" said Tim. \"Come along.\" When they reached the pier, they found a number of boys, men, and hack-drivers already in waiting. They had to wait about half an hour, when they saw the great steamer slowly approaching the wharf. Instantly Tim was on the alert. \"When they begin to come ashore, you must go in and try your luck. Just do as I do.\" This Sam resolved to do. A tall man emerged from the steamer, bearing a heavy carpet-bag. \"Smash yer baggage?\" said Tim. \"No, I think not. I can carry it myself.\" \"I haven\u0027t had any breakfast,\" said Tim, screwing up his freckled features into an expression of patient suffering. \"Nor I either,\" said the stranger, smiling. \"You\u0027ve got money to buy some, and I haven\u0027t,\" said Tim, keeping at his side. \"Well, you may carry it,\" said the gentleman, good-naturedly. Tim turned half round, and winked at Sam, as much as to say, \"Did you see how I did it?\" Sam was quick enough to take the hint. \"Smash your carpet-bag?\" he asked of a middle-aged lady, imitating as closely as possible Tim\u0027s professional accent. \"What?\" asked the lady, startled. \"She don\u0027t understand,\" thought Sam. \"Let me carry it for you, ma\u0027am.\" \"I do not need it. I am going to take a cab.\" \"Let me take it to the cab,\" persisted Sam; but he was forestalled by a hack-driver who had heard the lady\u0027s remark. \"Let me take it, ma\u0027am,\" he said, thrusting Sam aside. \"I\u0027ve got a nice carriage just outside. Take you anywhere you want to go.\" So the lady was carried away, and Sam had to make a second application. This time he addressed himself to a gentleman whose little daughter walked by his side. \"No,\" said the gentleman; \"the carpet-bag is small. I don\u0027t need help.\" The smallness of the bag, by the way, was one reason why Sam, who did not like heavy bundles, wanted to carry it. He felt that it was time to practise on the stranger\u0027s feelings. \"I want to earn some money to buy bread for my mother,\" he whined, in a very creditable manner, considering how inexperienced he was. This attracted the attention of the little girl, who, like most little girls, had a tender and compassionate heart. \"Is your mother poor?\" she asked. \"Very poor,\" said Sam. \"She hasn\u0027t got a cent to buy bread for the children.\" \"Have you got many brothers and sisters?\" asked the little girl, her voice full of sympathy. \"Five,\" answered Sam, piteously. \"O papa,\" said the little girl, \"let him take your carpet-bag. Think of it, his mother hasn\u0027t got anything to eat.\" \"Well, Clara,\" said her father, indulgently, \"I suppose I must gratify you. Here, boy, take the bag, and carry it carefully.\" \"All right, sir,\" said Sam, cheerfully. \"I guess I can get along,\" he thought, complacently. \"That\u0027s a good dodge.\" \"When we get to Broadway, we\u0027ll take the stage,\" said the gentleman. \"Take hold of my hand, tight, Clara, while we cross the street.\" Clara seemed disposed to be sociable, and entered into conversation with the young baggage-smasher. \"Are your brothers and sisters younger than you?\" she inquired. \"Yes,\" said Sam. \"How many of them are boys?\" \"There\u0027s two boys besides me, and three girls,\" said Sam, readily. \"What are their names?\" asked Clara. \"Why,\" answered Sam, hesitating a little, \"there\u0027s Tom and Jim and John, and Sam and Maggie.\" \"I don\u0027t see how that can be,\" said Clara, puzzled. \"Just now; you said there were three girls and only two boys.\" \"Did I?\" said Sam, rather abashed. \"I didn\u0027t think what I was saying.\" \"Isn\u0027t your father alive?\" asked the little girl. \"No; he\u0027s dead.\" \"And do you have to support the family?\" \"Yes; except what mother does.\" \"What does she do?\" \"Oh, she goes out washing.\" \"Poor boy, I suppose you have a hard time.\" \"Yes,\" said Sam; \"some days we don\u0027t get anything to eat.\" \"O papa, isn\u0027t it dreadful?\" said Clara, her warm little heart throbbing with sympathy. Her father was less credulous, and he was struck by Sam\u0027s hearty appearance. Certainly he looked very unlike a boy who did not have enough to eat. \"You don\u0027t look as if you suffered much from hunger, my boy,\" said he, with a penetrating look. \"I had a good dinner yesterday,\" said Sam. \"A gentleman gave me some money for showing him the way to the \u0027Tribune\u0027 office.\" \"One dinner seems to have done you a great deal of good,\" said the man. \"It always does me good,\" said Sam, and here he had no occasion to tell a falsehood. \"I hope you carried some of the money home to your mother, and brothers and sisters.\" \"Yes, I did; I bought some meat, and mother cooked it. We don\u0027t often have meat.\" \"Perhaps I am doing the boy injustice,\" thought Mr. Glenham, for this was his name. As for Clara, her childish sympathies were fully aroused. \"Papa,\" she said, \"may I give this poor boy the half dollar Aunt Lucy gave me?\" \"I thought you had arranged some way of spending it, Clara.\" \"So I had, papa; but I\u0027d rather give it to this poor boy,\" \"You may do as you like, my darling,\" said her father, tenderly. \"Here, poor boy, take this home to your mother,\" said Clara. My readers have probably inferred already that Sam was not a boy of very high principles, but I must do him the justice to say that he felt ashamed to take the money tendered him by the little girl upon whom he had imposed by his false story. \"I don\u0027t like to take your money,\" he said, hanging back. \"But I want you to,\" said Clara, eagerly. \"I\u0027d a great deal rather your mother would have it.\" \"You may take it,\" said Mr. Glenham, who was disposed to regard Sam with greater favor, on account of the reluctance he exhibited to profit by Clara\u0027s compassion. \"Thank you,\" said Sam, no longer withholding his hand. \"You are very kind.\" By this time they had reached Broadway, and Sam delivered up the bag. Mr. Glenham handed him a quarter. \"That is for your trouble,\" he said. \"Thank you, sir,\" said Sam. A Broadway stage came up, and they both were lost to view. Sam was in good spirits over his good fortune. \"Seventy-five cents!\" he said to himself. \"That\u0027s what I call luck. I don\u0027t believe Tim\u0027s done so well. It aint so hard to make your living in New York, after all. I guess I\u0027ll go and get some breakfast.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3016/83387.html","bookId":265,"book":{"id":265,"title":"The Young Outlaw or, Adrift in the Streets","description":"简介： The Young Outlaw is the sixth volume of the Tattered Tom Series, and the twelfth of the stories which are wholly or mainly devoted to street-life in New York.
