{"id":8022,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER VII. — SAM MEETS HIS MATCH.","content":"Sam went upstairs with alacrity, and lay down on the bed,—not that he was particularly tired, but because he found it more agreeable to lie down than to work in the field. \"I wish I had something to read,\" he thought,—\"some nice dime novel like \u0027The Demon of the Danube.\u0027 That was splendid. I like it a good deal better than Dickens. It\u0027s more excitin\u0027.\" But there was no library in Sam\u0027s room, and it was very doubtful whether there were any dime novels in the house. The deacon belonged to the old school of moralists, and looked with suspicion upon all works of fiction, with a very few exceptions, such as Pilgrim\u0027s Progress, and Robinson Crusoe, which, however, he supposed to be true stories. Soon Sam heard the step of Mrs. Hopkins on the stairs. He immediately began to twist his features in such a way as to express pain. Mrs. Hopkins entered the room with a cup of hot liquid in her hand. \"How do you feel?\" she asked. \"I feel bad,\" said Sam. \"Are you in pain?\" \"Yes, I\u0027ve got a good deal of pain.\" \"Whereabouts?\" Sam placed his hand on his stomach, and looked sad. \"Yes, I know exactly what is the matter with you,\" said the deacon\u0027s wife. \"Then you know a good deal,\" thought Sam, \"for I don\u0027t know of anything at all myself.\" This was what he thought, but he said, \"Do you?\" \"Oh, yes; I\u0027ve had a good deal of experience. I know what is good for you.\" Sam looked curiously at the cup. \"What is it?\" he asked. \"It\u0027s hot tea; it\u0027s very healin\u0027.\" Sam supposed it to be ordinary tea, and he had no objection to take it. But when he put it to his lips there was something about the odor that did not please him. \"It doesn\u0027t smell good,\" he said, looking up in the face of Mrs. Hopkins. \"Medicine generally doesn\u0027t,\" she said, quietly. \"I thought it was tea,\" said Sam. \"So it is; it is wormwood-tea.\" \"I don\u0027t think I shall like it,\" hesitated Sam. \"No matter if you don\u0027t, it will do you good,\" said Mrs. Hopkins. Sam tasted it, and his face assumed an expression of disgust. \"I can\u0027t drink it,\" he said. \"You must,\" said Mrs. Hopkins, firmly. \"I guess I\u0027ll get well without,\" said our hero, feeling that he was in a scrape. \"No, you won\u0027t. You\u0027re quite unwell. I can see it by your face.\" \"Can you?\" said Sam, beginning to be alarmed about his health. \"You must take this tea,\" said the lady, firmly. \"I\u0027d rather not.\" \"That\u0027s neither here nor there. The deacon needs you well, so you can go to work, and this will cure you as quick as anything.\" \"Suppose it doesn\u0027t?\" said Sam. \"Then I shall bring you up some castor-oil in two hours.\" Castor-oil! This was even worse than wormwood-tea, and Sam\u0027s heart sank within him. \"The old woman\u0027s too much for me,\" he thought, with a sigh. \"Come, take the tea,\" said Mrs. Hopkins. \"I can\u0027t wait here all day.\" Thus adjured, Sam made a virtue of necessity, and, shutting his eyes, gulped down the wormwood. He shuddered slightly when it was all done, and his face was a study. \"Well done!\" said Mrs. Hopkins. \"It\u0027s sure to do you good.\" \"I think I\u0027d have got well without,\" said Sam. \"I\u0027m afraid it won\u0027t agree with me.\" \"If it don\u0027t,\" said Mrs. Hopkins, cheerfully, \"I\u0027ll try some castor-oil.\" \"I guess I won\u0027t need it,\" said Sam, hastily. \"It was awful,\" said Sam to himself, as his nurse left him alone. \"I\u0027d rather hoe potatoes than take it again. I never see such a terrible old woman. She would make me do it, when I wasn\u0027t no more sick than she is.\" Mrs. Hopkins smiled to herself as she went downstairs. \"Served him right,\" she said to herself. \"I\u0027ll l\u0027arn him to be sick. Guess he won\u0027t try it again very soon.\" Two hours later Mrs. Hopkins presented herself at Sam\u0027s door. He had been looking out of the window; but he bundled into bed as soon as he heard her. Appearances must be kept up. \"How do you feel now, Sam?\" asked Mrs. Hopkins. \"A good deal better,\" said Sam, surveying in alarm a cup of some awful decoction in her hand. \"Do you feel ready to go to work again?\" \"Almost,\" said Sam, hesitating. \"The wormwood-tea did you good, it seems; but you\u0027re not quite well yet.\" \"I\u0027ll soon be well,\" said Sam, hastily. \"I mean you shall be,\" said his visitor. \"I\u0027ve brought you some more medicine.\" \"Is it tea?\" \"No, castor-oil.\" \"I don\u0027t need it,\" said Sam, getting up quickly. \"I\u0027m well.\" \"If you are not well enough to go to work, you must take some oil.\" \"Yes, I am,\" said Sam. \"I\u0027ll go right out into the field.\" \"I don\u0027t want you to go unless you are quite recovered. I\u0027m sure the oil will bring you \u0027round.\" \"I\u0027m all right, now,\" said Sam, hastily. \"Very well; if you think so, you can go to work.\" Rather ruefully Sam made his way to the potato-field, with his hoe on his shoulder. \"Tea and castor-oil are worse than work,\" he thought. \"The old woman\u0027s got the best of me, after all. I wonder whether she knew I was makin\u0027 believe.\" On this point Sam could not make up his mind. She certainly seemed in earnest, and never expressed a doubt about his being really sick. But all the same, she made sickness very disagreeable to him, and he felt that in future he should not pretend sickness when she was at home. It made him almost sick to think of the bitter tea he had already drunk, and the oil would have been even worse. The deacon looked up as he caught sight of Sam. \"Have you got well?\" he asked innocently, for he had not been as clear-sighted as his wife in regard to the character of Sam\u0027s malady. \"Yes,\" said Sam, \"I\u0027m a good deal better, but I don\u0027t feel quite so strong as I did.\" \"Mebbe it would be well for you to fast a little,\" said the deacon, in all sincerity, for fasting was one of his specifics in case of sickness. \"No, I don\u0027t think it would,\" said Sam, quickly. \"I\u0027ll feel better by supper-time.\" \"I hope you will,\" said the deacon. \"I wish I had a piece of pie or somethin\u0027 to take the awful taste out of my mouth,\" thought Sam. \"I can taste that wormwood jist as plain! I wonder why such things are allowed to grow.\" For the rest of the afternoon Sam worked unusually well. He was under the the deacon\u0027s eye, and unable to get away, though he tried at least once. After they had been at work for about an hour, Sam said suddenly, \"Don\u0027t you feel thirsty, Deacon Hopkins?\" \"What makes you ask?\" said the deacon; \"Because I\u0027d jist as lieves go to the house and get some water,\" said Sam, with a very obliging air. \"You\u0027re very considerate, Samuel; but I don\u0027t think it\u0027s healthy to drink between meals.\" \"Supposin\u0027 you\u0027re thirsty,\" suggested Sam, disappointed. \"It\u0027s only fancy. You don\u0027t need drink railly. You only think you do,\" said the deacon, and he made some further remarks on the subject to which Sam listened discontentedly. He began to think his situation a very hard one. \"It\u0027s work—work all the time,\" he said to himself. \"What\u0027s the good of workin\u0027 yourself to death? When I\u0027m a man I\u0027ll work only when I want to.\" Sam did not consider that there might be some difficulty in earning a living unless he were willing to work for it. The present discomfort was all he thought of. At last, much to Sam\u0027s joy, the deacon gave the signal to return to the house. \"If you hadn\u0027t been sick, we\u0027d have got through more,\" he said; \"but to-morrow we must make up for lost time.\" \"I hope it\u0027ll rain to-morrow,\" thought Sam. \"We can\u0027t work in the rain.\" At supper the wormwood seemed to give him additional appetite. \"I\u0027m afraid you\u0027ll make yourself sick again, Samuel,\" said the deacon. \"There aint no danger,\" said Sam, looking alarmed at the suggestion. \"I feel all right now.\" \"The wormwood did you good,\" said Mrs. Hopkins, drily. \"I wonder if she means anything,\" thought Sam \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3016/83376.html","bookId":265,"book":{"id":265,"title":"The Young Outlaw or, Adrift in the Streets","description":"简介： The Young Outlaw is the sixth volume of the Tattered Tom Series, and the twelfth of the stories which are wholly or mainly devoted to street-life in New York.
