{"id":68802,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"Lara told Paul Martin about her decision to fast-track the hotel and the discussion she had had with the committee.\n \"They may have been right,\" Paul said. \"What you\u0027re doing could be dangerous.\"\n \"Trump does it. Uris does it.\"\n Paul said gently, \"Baby, you\u0027re not Trump or Uris.\"\n \"I\u0027m going to be bigger than they are, Paul. I\u0027m going to put up more buildings in New York than anyone ever has before. It\u0027s going to be my city.\"\n He looked at her for a long moment. \"I believe you.\"\n Lara had an unlisted telephone installed in her office. Only Paul Martin had the number. He installed a telephone in his office for Lara\u0027s calls. They spoke to each other several times a day.\n Whenever they could get away in the afternoon, they went to Lara\u0027s apartment. Paul Martin looked forward to those trysts more than he had ever believed possible. Lara had become an obsession with him.\n When Keller became aware of what was happening, he was concerned.\n \"Lara,\" he said, \"I think you\u0027re making a mistake. He\u0027s dangerous.\"\n \"You don\u0027t know him. He\u0027s wonderful.\"\n \"Are you in love with him?\"\n Lara thought about it. Paul Martin fulfilled a need in her life. But was she in love with him?\n \"No.\"\n \"Is he in love with you?\"\n \"I think so.\"\n \"Be careful. Be very careful.\"\n Lara smiled. Impulsively, she kissed Keller\u0027s cheek. \"I love the way you take care of me, Howard.\"\n Lara was at the construction site, studying a report.\n \"I notice we\u0027re paying for an awful lot of lumber,\" Lara said. She was talking to Pete Reese, the new project manager.\n \"I didn\u0027t want to mention it before, Miss Cameron, because I wasn\u0027t sure - but you\u0027re right. A lot of our lumber\u0027s missing. We\u0027ve had to double order it.\"\n She looked up at him. \"You mean, someone is stealing it?\"\n \"It looks that way.\"\n \"Do you have any idea who?\"\n \"No.\"\n \"We have night watchmen here, don\u0027t we?\"\n \"One watchman.\"\n \"And he hasn\u0027t seen anything?\"\n \"No. But with all this activity going on, it could be happening during the day. It could be anybody.\"\n Lara was thoughtful. \"I see. Thanks for letting me know, Pete. I\u0027ll take care of it.\"\n That afternoon Lara hired a private detective, Steve Kane. \"How does anyone walk away in broad daylight with a load of lumber?\" Kane asked.\n \"You tell me.\"\n \"You say there\u0027s a night watchman at the site?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"Maybe he\u0027s in on it.\"\n \"I\u0027m not interested in maybes,\" Lara said. \"Find out who\u0027s behind it and get back to me.\"\n \"Can you get me hired as a member of the construction crew?\"\n \"I\u0027ll take care of it.\"\n Steve Kane went to work at the site the next day.\n When Lara told Keller what was happening, he said, \"You didn\u0027t have to get involved in this. I could have handled it for you.\"\n \"I like handling things myself,\" Lara said.\n That was the end of the conversation.\n Five days later Kane appeared at Lara\u0027s office.\n \"Have you found out anything?\"\n \"Everything,\" he said.\n \"Was it the watchman?\"\n \"No. The lumber wasn\u0027t stolen from the building site.\"\n \"What do you mean?\"\n \"I mean it never reached there. It was sent to another construction site in Jersey and double-billed. The invoices were doctored.\"\n \"Who\u0027s behind it?\" Lara asked.\n Kane told her.\n The following afternoon there was a meeting of the committee. Terry Hill, Lara\u0027s lawyer, was there, Howard Keller, Jim Belon, the project manager, and Pete Reese. There was also a stranger at the conference table. Lara introduced him as Mr. Conroy.\n \"Let\u0027s have a report,\" Lara said.\n Pete Reese said, \"We\u0027re right on schedule. We estimate four more months. You were right about going fast track. It\u0027s all going smooth as silk. We\u0027ve already started on the electrical and plumbing.\"\n \"Good,\" Lara said.\n \"What about the stolen lumber?\" Keller asked.\n \"Nothing new on it yet,\" Pete Reese said. \"We\u0027re keeping an eye open.\"\n \"I don\u0027t think we have to worry about that anymore,\" Lara announced. \"We found out who\u0027s stealing it.\" She nodded toward the stranger. \"Mr. Conroy is with the Special Fraud Squad. It\u0027s actually Detective Conroy.\"\n \"What\u0027s he doing here?\" Pete Reese asked.\n \"He\u0027s come to take you away.\"\n Reese looked up, startled. \"What?\"\n Lara turned to the group. \"Mr. Reese has been selling our lumber to another construction job. When he found out that I was checking the reports, he decided to tell me there was a problem.\"\n \"Wait a minute,\" Pete Reese said. \"I...I...You have it wrong.\"\n She turned to Conroy. \"Would you please get him out of here?\"\n She turned to the others. \"Now, let\u0027s discuss the opening of the hotel.\"\n As the hotel grew nearer completion, the pressure became more intense. Lara was becoming impossible. She badgered everyone constantly. She made phone calls in the middle of the night.\n \"Howard, did you know the shipment of wallpaper hasn\u0027t arrived yet?\"\n \"For God\u0027s sake, Lara, it\u0027s four o\u0027clock in the morning.\"\n \"It\u0027s ninety days to the opening of the hotel. We can\u0027t open a hotel without wallpaper.\"\n \"I\u0027ll check it out in the morning.\"\n \"This is morning. Check it out now.\"\n Lara\u0027s nervousness increased as the deadline grew closer. She met with Tom Scott, head of the advertising agency.\n \"Do you have small children, Mr. Scott?\"\n He looked at her in surprise. \"No. Why?\"\n \"Because I just went over the new advertising campaign and it seems to have been devised by a small retarded child. I can\u0027t believe that grown men sat down and thought up this junk.\"\n Scott frowned. \"If there\u0027s something about it that displeases you...\"\n \"Everything about it displeases me,\" Lara said. \"It lacks excitement. It\u0027s bland. It could be about any hotel anywhere. This isn\u0027t any hotel, Mr. Scott. This is the most beautiful, most modern hotel in New York. You make it sound like a cold, faceless building. It\u0027s a warm, exciting home. Let\u0027s spread the word. Do you think you can handle that?\"\n \"I assure you we can handle it. We\u0027ll revise the campaign and in two weeks...\"\n \"Monday,\" Lara said flatly. \"I want to see the new campaign Monday.\"\n The new ads went out in newspapers and magazines and billboards all over the country.\n \"I think the campaign turned out great,\" Tom Scott said. \"You were right.\"\n Lara looked at him and said quietly, \"I don\u0027t want to be right. I want you to be right. That\u0027s what I pay you for.\"\n She turned to Jerry Townsend, in charge of publicity.\n \"Have the invitations all been sent out?\"\n \"Yes. We\u0027ve gotten most of our replies already. Everybody\u0027s coming to the opening. It\u0027s going to be quite a party.\"\n \"It should be,\" Keller grumbled, \"it\u0027s costing enough.\"\n Lara grinned. \"Stop being a banker. We \u0027ll get a million dollars\u0027 worth of publicity. We\u0027re going to have dozens of celebrities there and...\"\n He held up his hand. \"All right, all right.\"\n Two weeks before the opening, everything seemed to be happening at once. The wallpaper had arrived and carpets were being installed; halls were being painted and pictures were being hung. Lara inspected every suite, accompanied by a staff of five.\n She walked into one suite and said, \"The drapes are wrong. Switch them with the suite next door.\"\n In another suite, she tried the piano. \"It\u0027s out of tune. Take care of it.\"\n In a third suite the electric fireplace didn\u0027t work. \"Fix it.\"\n It seemed to the harried staff that Lara was trying to do everything herself. She was in the kitchen and in the laundry room and in the utility closets. She was everywhere, demanding, complaining, fixing.\n The man whom she had hired to manage the hotel said, \"Don\u0027t get so excited, Miss Cameron. At the opening of any hotel, little things always go wrong.\"\n \"Not in my hotels,\" Lara said. \"Not in my hotels.\"\n The day of the opening, Lara was up at 4:00 A.M., too nervous to sleep. She wanted desperately to talk to Paul Martin, but there was no way she could call him at that hour. She dressed and went for a walk.\n Everything is going to be fine, she told herself. The reservation computer is going to be fixed. They\u0027ll get the third oven working. The lock on Suite Seven will be repaired. We\u0027ll find a replacement for the maids who quit yesterday. The air-conditioning unit in the penthouse will work...\n At six o\u0027clock that evening the invited guests began to arrive. A uniformed guard at each entrance to the hotel examined their invitations before admitting them. There was a mix of celebrities, famous athletes, and corporation executives. Lara had gone over the list carefully, eliminating the names of the freeloaders and the hangers-on.\n She stood in the spacious lobby greeting the newcomers as they arrived. \"I\u0027m Lara Cameron. So nice of you to come...Please feel free to look around.\"\n Lara took Keller aside. \"Why isn\u0027t the mayor coming?\"\n \"He\u0027s pretty busy, you know, and...\"\n \"You mean he thinks I\u0027m not important enough.\"\n \"One day he\u0027ll change his mind.\"\n One of the mayor\u0027s assistants arrived.\n \"Thank you for coming,\" Lara said. \"This is an honor for the hotel.\"\n Lara kept looking nervously for Todd Grayson, the architectural critic for The New York Times, who had been invited. If he likes it, Lara thought, we have a winner.\n Paul Martin arrived with his wife. It was the first time Lara had seen Mrs. Martin. She was an attractive, elegant-looking woman. Lara felt an unexpected pang of guilt.\n Paul walked up to Lara. \"Miss Cameron, I\u0027m Paul Martin. This is my wife, Nina. Thank you for inviting us.\"\n Lara gripped his hand a second longer than necessary. \"I\u0027m delighted that you\u0027re here. Please make yourself at home.\"\n Paul looked around the lobby. He had seen it half a dozen times before. \"It\u0027s beautiful,\" he exclaimed. \"I think you\u0027re going to be very successful.\"\n Nina Martin was staring at Lara. \"I\u0027m sure she will be.\"\n And Lara wondered if she knew.\n The guests began to stream in.\n An hour later Lara was standing in the lobby when Keller rushed up to her. \"For God\u0027s sakes,\" he said, \"everyone\u0027s looking for you. They\u0027re all in the ballroom, eating. Why aren\u0027t you in there?\"\n \"Todd Grayson hasn\u0027t arrived. I\u0027m waiting for him.\"\n \"The Times\u0027 architectural critic? I saw him an hour ago.\"\n \"What?\"\n \"Yes. He went on a tour of the hotel with the others.\"\n \"Why didn\u0027t you tell me?\"\n \"I thought you knew.\"\n \"What did he say?\" Lara asked eagerly. \"How did he look? Did he seem impressed?\"\n \"He didn\u0027t say anything. He looked fine. And I don\u0027t know whether he was impressed or not.\"\n \"Didn\u0027t he say anything?\"\n \"No.\"\n Lara frowned. \"He would have said something if he had liked it. It\u0027s a bad sign, Howard.\"\n The party was a huge success. The guests ate and drank and toasted the hotel. When the evening was over, Lara was showered with compliments.\n \"It\u0027s such a lovely hotel, Miss Cameron...\"\n \"I\u0027ll certainly stay here when I come back to New York...\"\n \"What a great idea, having a piano in every living room...\"\n \"I love the fireplaces...\"\n \"I\u0027ll certainly recommend this to all my friends...\"\n Well, Lara thought, even if The New York Times hates it, it\u0027s going to be a success.\n Lara saw Paul Martin and his wife as they were leaving.\n \"I think you really have a winner here, Miss Cameron. It\u0027s going to be the talk of New York.\"\n \"You\u0027re very kind, Mr. Martin,\" Lara said. \"Thank you for coming.\"\n Nina Martin said quietly, \"Good night, Miss Cameron.\"\n \"Good night.\"\n As they were walking out the lobby door, Lara heard her say, \"She\u0027s very beautiful, isn\u0027t she, Paul?\"\n The following Thursday when the first edition of The New York Times came out, Lara was at the newsstand at Fortysecond Street and Broadway at four o\u0027clock in the morning, to pick up a copy. She hurriedly turned to the Home Section. Todd Grayson\u0027s article began:\n Manhattan has long needed a hotel that does not remind travelers that they\u0027re staying in a hotel. The suites at the Cameron Plaza are large and gracious, and done in beautiful taste. Lara Cameron has finally given New York...\n She yelled aloud with joy. She telephoned Keller and woke him up.\n \"We\u0027re in!\" she said. \"The Times loves us.\"\n He sat up in bed, groggy. \"That\u0027s great. What did they say?\"\n Lara read the article to him. \"All right,\" Keller said, \"Now you can get some sleep.\"\n \"Sleep? Are you joking? I have a new site picked out. As soon as the banks open, I want you to start negotiating a loan....\"\n The New York Cameron Plaza was a triumph. It was completely booked, and there was a waiting list.\n \"It\u0027s only the beginning,\" Lara told Keller. \"There are ten thousand builders in the metropolitan area - but only a handful of the big boys - the Tisches, the Rudins, the Rockefellers, the Sterns. Well, whether they like it or not, we\u0027re going to play in their sandbox. We\u0027re going to change the skyline. We\u0027re going to invent the future.\"\n Lara began to get calls from banks offering her loans. She cultivated the important real estate brokers, taking them to dinner and the theater. She had power breakfasts at the Regency and was told about properties that were about to come on the market. She acquired two more downtown sites and began construction.\n Paul Martin telephoned Lara at the office. \"Have you seen Business Week? You\u0027re a hot ticket,\" he said. \"The word\u0027s out that you\u0027re a shaker. You get things done.\"\n \"I try.\"\n \"Are you free for dinner?\"\n \"I\u0027ll make myself free.\"\n Lara was in a meeting with the partner of a top architectural firm. She was examining the blueprints and drawings they had brought.\n \"You\u0027re going to like this,\" the chief architect said. \"It has grace and symmetry and the scope that you asked for. Let me explain some of the details...\"\n \"That won\u0027t be necessary,\" Lara said. \"I understand them.\" She looked up. \"I want you to turn these plans over to an artist.\"\n \"What?\"\n \"I want large color drawings of the building. I want drawings of the lobby, the corridors, and the offices. Bankers have no imagination. I\u0027m going to show them what the building is going to look like.\"\n \"That\u0027s a great idea.\"\n Lara\u0027s secretary appeared. \"I\u0027m sorry I\u0027m late.\"\n \"This meeting was called for nine o\u0027clock, Kathy. It\u0027s nine-fifteen.\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry, Miss Cameron, my alarm didn\u0027t go off and...\"\n \"We\u0027ll discuss it later.\"\n She turned to the architects. \"I want a few changes made...\"\n Two hours later Lara had finished discussing the changes she wanted. When the meeting was over, she said to Kathy, \"Don\u0027t leave. Sit down.\"\n Kathy sat.\n \"Do you like your job?\"\n \"Yes, Miss Cameron.\"\n \"This is the third time you\u0027ve been late this week. I won\u0027t put up with that again.\"\n \"I\u0027m terribly sorry, I...I haven\u0027t been feeling well.\"\n \"What\u0027s your problem?\"\n \"It\u0027s nothing, really.\"\n \"It\u0027s obviously enough to keep you from coming in on time. What is it?\"\n \"I haven\u0027t been sleeping very well lately. To tell you the truth, I...I\u0027m scared.\"\n \"Scared of what?\" Lara asked impatiently.\n \"I...I have a lump.\"\n \"Oh.\" Lara was silent for a moment. \"Well, what did the doctor say?\"\n Kathy swallowed. \"I haven\u0027t seen a doctor.\"\n \"Not seen one!\" Lara exploded. \"For God\u0027s sakes, do you come from a family of ostriches? Of course you\u0027ve got to see a doctor.\"\n Lara picked up the phone. \"Get me Dr. Peters.\"\n She replaced the receiver. \"It\u0027s probably nothing, but you can\u0027t let it go.\"\n \"I have a mother and brother who died of cancer,\" Kathy said miserably. \"I don\u0027t want a doctor to tell me I have it.\"\n The telephone rang. Lara picked it up. \"Hello? he what?...I don\u0027t care if he is. You tell him I want to talk to him now.\"\n She replaced the receiver.\n A few moments later the phone rang again. Lara picked it up. \"Hello, Alan...no, I\u0027m fine. I\u0027m sending my secretary over to see you. Her name is Kathy Turner. She\u0027ll be there in half an hour. I want her examined this morning, and I want you to stay on top of it...I know you are...I appreciate it...thanks.\"\n She replaced the receiver. \"Get over to Sloan-Kettering Hospital. Dr. Peters will be waiting for you.\"\n \"I don\u0027t know what to say, Miss Cameron.\"\n \"Say that you\u0027ll be on time tomorrow.\"\n Howard Keller came into the office. \"We have a problem, boss.\"\n \"Go.\"\n \"It\u0027s the property on Fourteenth Street. We\u0027ve cleared the tenants out of the whole block except for one apartment house. The Dorchester Apartments. Six of the tenants refuse to leave, and the city won\u0027t let us force them out.\"\n \"Offer them more money.\"\n \"It\u0027s not a question of money. Those people have lived there a long time. They don\u0027t want to leave. They\u0027re comfortable there.\"\n \"Then let\u0027s make them uncomfortable.\"\n \"What do you mean?\"\n Lara got up. \"Let\u0027s go take a look at the building.\"\n On the drive down, they passed bag ladies and homeless people roaming the streets, asking for handouts.\n \"In a country as wealthy as this,\" Lara said, \"that\u0027s a disgrace.\"\n The Dorchester Apartments was a six-story brick building in the middle of a block filled with old structures waiting for the bulldozers.\n Lara stood in front of it, examining it. \"How many tenants are in there?\"\n \"We got sixteen out of the apartment. Six are still hanging on.\"\n \"That means we have sixteen apartments available.\"\n He looked at her, puzzled. \"That\u0027s right. Why?\"\n \"Let\u0027s fill those apartments.\"\n \"You mean, lease them? What\u0027s the point...\"\n \"We\u0027re not going to lease them. We\u0027re going to donate them to the homeless. There are thousands of homeless people in New York. We\u0027re going to take care of some of them. Crowd in as many as you can. See that they\u0027re given some food.\"\n Keller frowned. \"What makes me think this isn\u0027t one of your better ideas?\"\n \"Howard, we\u0027re going to become benefactors. We\u0027re going to do something the city can\u0027t do - shelter the homeless.\"\n Lara was studying the building more closely, looking at the windows. \"And I want those windows boarded up.\"\n \"What?\"\n \"We\u0027re going to make the building look like an old derelict. Is the top floor apartment still occupied, the one with the roof garden?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"Put up a big billboard on the roof to block the view.\"\n \"But...\"\n \"Get to work on it.\"\n When Lara returned to the office, there was a message for her. \"Dr. Peters would like you to call him,\" Tricia said.\n \"Get him for me.\"\n He came on the phone almost immediately.\n \"Lara, I examined your secretary.\"\n \"Yes?\"\n \"She has a tumor. I\u0027m afraid it\u0027s malignant. I recommend an immediate mastectomy.\"\n \"I want a second opinion,\" Lara said.\n \"Of course, if you wish, but I am head of the department and...\"\n \"I still want a second opinion. Have someone else examine her. Get back to me as soon as possible. Where is Kathy now?\"\n \"She\u0027s on her way back to your office.\"\n \"Thanks, Alan.\"\n Lara replaced the receiver. She pressed down the intercom button. \"When Kathy returns, send her in to me.\"\n Lara studied the calendar on her desk. She had only thirty days left to clear out the Dorchester Apartments before construction was scheduled to start.\n Six stubborn tenants. All right, Lara thought, let\u0027s see how long they can hold out.\n Kathy walked into Lara\u0027s office. Her face was puffy and her eyes were red.\n \"I heard the news,\" Lara told her. \"I\u0027m so sorry, Kathy.\"\n \"I\u0027m going to die,\" Kathy said.\n Lara rose and put her arms around her, holding her close. \"You\u0027re not going to do anything of the kind. They\u0027ve made a lot of progress with cancer. You\u0027re going to have the operation, and you\u0027re going to be all right.\"\n \"Miss Cameron, I can\u0027t afford...\"\n \"Everything will be taken care of. Dr. Peters is going to see that you have one more examination. If it verifies his diagnosis, you should have the operation right away. Now go home and get some rest.\"\n Kathy\u0027s eyes filled with tears again. \"I...thank you.\"\n As Kathy walked out of the office, she thought, No one really knows that lady. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-stars-shine-down/page-15.html","bookId":2364,"book":{"id":2364,"title":"The Stars Shine Down","description":"Storyline: \n Lara Cameron is a famous powerful wealthy New York building developer who struggled from brutal poverty in Glace Bay, a banker who took her body as part of her first deal, to Chicago, banker Keller whose love she takes lightly for granted.
