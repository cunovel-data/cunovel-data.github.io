{"id":68805,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"On Christmas Day Lara stayed home. She had been invited to a dozen parties, but Paul Martin was going to drop by. \"I have to be with Nina and the kids today,\" he had explained, \"but I want to come by and see you.\"\n She wondered what Philip Adler was doing on this Christmas Day.\n It was a Currier \u0026 Ives postcard kind of day. New York was blanketed in a beautiful white snowfall, wrapped in silence. When Paul Martin arrived, he had a shopping bag full of gifts for Lara.\n \"I had to stop at the office to pick these up,\" he said. So his wife wouldn\u0027t know.\n \"You give me so much, Paul. You don\u0027t have to bring anything.\"\n \"I wanted to. Open them up now.\"\n Lara was touched by his eagerness to see her reaction.\n The gifts were thoughtful and expensive. A necklace from Cartier\u0027s, scarves from Hermes, books from Rizzoli, an antique carriage clock, and a small white envelope. Lara opened it. It read: \"Cameron Reno Hotel \u0026 Casino\" in large block letters. She looked up at him, in surprise. \"I have the hotel?\"\n He nodded confidently. \"You will have. The bidding starts next week. You\u0027re going to have fun with it,\" Paul Martin predicted.\n \"I don\u0027t know anything about running a casino.\"\n \"Don\u0027t worry. I\u0027ll put some professionals in to manage it for you. The hotel, you can handle yourself.\"\n \"I don\u0027t know how to thank you. You do so much for me.\"\n He took her hands in his. \"There isn\u0027t anything in the world that I wouldn\u0027t do for you. Remember that.\"\n \"I will,\" she said solemnly.\n He was looking at his watch. \"I have to get back home. I wish...\"He hesitated.\n \"Yes?\"\n \"Never mind. Merry Christmas, Lara.\"\n \"Merry Christmas, Paul.\"\n She went to the window and looked out. The sky had become a delicate curtain of dancing snowflakes. Restless, Lara walked to the radio and turned it on. An announcer was saying, \"...and now, for its holiday program, the Boston Symphony Orchestra presents Beethoven\u0027s Piano Concerto No. Five in E flat, with Philip Adler, soloist.\"\n Lara listened with her eyes, seeing him at the piano, handsome and elegant. When the music ended, she thought, I\u0027ve got to see him again.\n Bill Whitman was one of the best construction supervisors in the business. He had risen through the ranks and was in great demand. He worked steadily and earned good money, but he was dissatisfied. For years he had watched builders reaping enormous fortunes while he got nothing but a salary. In a way, he thought, they\u0027re making their money off of me. The owner gets the cake; I get the crumbs. But the day Lara Cameron had gone before the community board, everything changed. She had lied to get the board\u0027s approval, and that lie could destroy her. If I went to the board and told them the truth, she\u0027d be out of business.\n But Bill Whitman had no intention of doing that. He had a better plan. He intended to use what had happened as lever-age. The boss lady was going to give him anything he asked for. He could sense from their first meeting at which he had asked for a promotion and raise that she was going to give in. She had no choice. I\u0027ll start small, Bill Whitman thought happily, and then I\u0027ll begin squeezing.\n Two days after Christmas, work began again on the Eastside Plaza project. Whitman looked around at the huge site and thought, This one\u0027s going to be a real moneymaker. Only this time, I\u0027m going to cash in on it, too.\n The site was crowded with heavy equipment. Cranes were digging into the earth and lifting tons of it into waiting trucks. A crane wielding a giant saw-toothed scoop bucket seemed to be stuck. The huge arm hung suspended high in midair. Whitman strode toward the cab, under the huge metal bucket.\n \"Hey, Jesse,\" he called. \"What\u0027s the matter up there?\"\n The man in the cab mumbled something that Whitman could not hear.\n Whitman moved closer. \"What?\"\n Everything happened in a split second. A chain slipped, and the huge metal bucket came crashing down on Whitman, smashing him to the ground. Men came running toward the body, but there was nothing to be done.\n \"The safety brake slipped,\" the operator explained later. \"Gee, I feel really awful. I liked Bill a lot.\"\n When she heard the news, Lara immediately telephoned Paul Martin. \"Did you hear about Bill Whitman?\"\n \"Yes. It was on television.\"\n \"Paul, you didn\u0027t...?\"\n He laughed. \"Don\u0027t go getting any crazy ideas. You\u0027ve been seeing too many movies. Remember, the good guys always win in the end.\"\n And Lara wondered, Am I one of the good guys?\n There were more than a dozen bidders for the Reno hotel.\n \"When do I bid?\" Lara asked Paul.\n \"You don\u0027t. Not until I tell you. Let the others jump in first.\"\n The bidding was secret, and the bids were sealed, to be opened on the following Friday. By Wednesday Lara still had not made a bid. She telephoned Paul Martin.\n \"Sit tight,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll tell you when.\"\n They stayed in touch by phone several times a day.\n At 5:00 P.M. , one hour before the bidding was to close, Lara received a phone call.\n \"Now! The high bid is a hundred and twenty million. I want you to go five million over it.\"\n Lara gasped. \"But if I do that, I\u0027ll lose money on the deal.\"\n \"Trust me,\" Paul said. \"After you get the hotel and start redoing it, you can cut corners on the changes. They\u0027ll all be endorsed by the supervising engineer. You\u0027ll make up the five million and then some.\"\n The following day Lara was notified that hers was the winning bid.\n Now Lara and Keller were on their way to Reno.\n The hotel was called the Reno Palace. It was large and sumptuous, with fifteen hundred rooms and a huge, glittering casino that was empty. Lara and Howard Keller were being escorted through the casino by a man named Tony Wilkie.\n \"The people who owned this got a bum deal,\" Wilkie said.\n \"What kind of bum deal?\" Keller asked.\n \"Well, it seems that a couple of the boys were pocketing a little money from the cash cage...\"\n \"Skimming,\" Keller interjected.\n \"Yeah. Of course, the owners didn\u0027t know anything about it.\"\n \"Of course not.\"\n \"But someone blew the whistle, and the Gaming Commission pulled out the rug. It\u0027s too bad. It was a very profitable operation.\"\n \"I know.\" Keller had already studied the books.\n When the tour of inspection was completed, and Lara and Howard were alone, she said, \"Paul was right. This is a gold mine.\" She saw the expression on Howard\u0027s face. \"What\u0027s the matter?\"\n He shrugged. \"I don\u0027t know. I just don\u0027t like us getting involved in anything like this.\"\n \"What\u0027s \u0027anything like this\u0027? It\u0027s a cash cow, Howard.\"\n \"Who\u0027s going to run the casino?\"\n \"We\u0027ll find people,\" Lara said evasively.\n \"Where from? The Girl Scouts? It takes gamblers to run an operation like this. I don\u0027t know any, do you?\"\n Lara was silent.\n \"I\u0027ll bet Paul Martin does.\"\n \"Leave him out of this,\" Lara said.\n \"I\u0027d like to, and I\u0027d like to leave you out of it. I don\u0027t think this is such a great idea.\"\n \"You didn\u0027t think the Queens project was a great idea either, did you? Or the shopping center on Houston Street. But they\u0027re making money, aren\u0027t they?\"\n \"Lara, I never said they weren\u0027t good deals. All I said was that I think we\u0027re moving too fast. You\u0027re swallowing up everything in sight, but you haven\u0027t digested anything yet.\"\n Lara patted his cheek. \"Relax.\"\n The members of the Gaming Commission received Lara with elaborate courtesy.\n \"We don\u0027t often meet a beautiful young woman in here,\" the chairman said. \"It brightens up our day.\"\n Lara did look beautiful. She was wearing a Donna Karan beige wool suit, with a cream-colored silk blouse and, for good luck, one of the scarves Paul had given her for Christmas. She smiled. \"Thank you.\"\n \"What can we do for you?\" one of the gaming commissioners asked. They all knew perfectly well what they could do for her.\n \"I\u0027m here because I would like to do something for Reno,\" Lara said earnestly. \"I would like to give it the biggest, most beautiful hotel in Nevada. I\u0027d like to add five stories to the Reno Palace, and put up a large convention center to attract more tourists here to gamble.\"\n The members of the board glanced at one another. The chairman said, \"I think something like that would have a very beneficial effect on the city. Of course, our job is to make sure that an operation like this would be run completely aboveboard.\"\n \"I\u0027m not exactly an escaped convict,\" Lara smiled.\n They chuckled at her little joke. \"We know your record, Miss Cameron, and it is admirable. However, you\u0027ve had no experience in running a casino.\"\n \"That\u0027s true,\" Lara admitted. \"On the other hand, I\u0027m sure it will be easy to find fine, qualified employees who will meet the approval of this commission. I would certainly welcome your guidance.\"\n One of the members of the commission spoke up. \"As far as the financing is concerned, can you guarantee...?\"\n The chairman interrupted. \"That\u0027s all right, Tom, Miss Cameron has submitted the financials on it. I\u0027ll see that you each get a copy.\"\n Lara sat there, waiting.\n The chairman said, \"I can\u0027t promise anything at this moment, Miss Cameron, but I think I\u0027m safe in saying that I don\u0027t see any obstacles to your being granted a license.\"\n Lara beamed. \"That\u0027s wonderful. I\u0027d like to get moving as quickly as possible.\"\n \"I\u0027m afraid things don\u0027t move quite that fast here. There will be a one-month waiting period before we can give you a definite answer.\"\n Lara was dismayed. \"A month?\"\n \"Yes. We have a bit of checking to do.\"\n \"I understand,\" Lara said. \"That will be fine.\"\n There was a music store in the hotel\u0027s shopping complex. In the window was a large poster of Philip Adler, advertising his new compact disc.\n Lara was not interested in the music. She bought the CD for Philip\u0027s photograph on the back of the case.\n On their way back to New York, Lara said, \"Howard, what do you know about Philip Adler?\"\n \"Just what everybody else knows. He\u0027s probably the top concert pianist in the world today. He plays with the finest symphony orchestras. I read somewhere that he just set up a foundation for scholarships for minority musicians in inner cities.\"\n \"What\u0027s it called?\"\n \"The Philip Adler Foundation, I think.\"\n \"I\u0027d like to make a contribution,\" Lara said. \"Send them a check for ten thousand dollars in my name.\"\n Keller looked at her in surprise. \"I thought you didn\u0027t care for classical music.\"\n \"I\u0027m starting to get interested in it,\" Lara said.\n The headline read:\n DISTRICT ATTORNEY PROBE OF PAUL MARTIN - ATTORNEY REPUTED TO HAVE MAFIA TIES\n Lara read the story with dismay and telephoned Paul immediately.\n \"What\u0027s going on?\" Lara asked.\n He chuckled. \"The DA is on another fishing expedition. They\u0027ve been trying to tie me in with the boys for years, and they haven\u0027t had any luck. Every time an election comes up, they try to use me as their whipping boy. Don\u0027t worry about it. What about dinner tonight?\"\n \"Fine,\" Lara said.\n \"I know a little place on Mulberry Street where no one will bother us.\"\n Over dinner Paul Martin said, \"I hear that the meeting with the Gaming Commission went well.\"\n \"I think it did. They seemed friendly, but I\u0027ve never done anything like this before.\"\n \"I don\u0027t think you\u0027ll have any problem. I\u0027ll get you some good boys for the casino. The man who owned the license got greedy.\" He changed the subject. \"How are all the construction jobs going?\"\n \"Fine. I have three projects in the works, Paul.\"\n \"You\u0027re not getting in over your head, are you, Lara?\"\n He sounded like Howard Keller. \"No. Every job is on budget and on schedule.\"\n \"That\u0027s good, baby. I wouldn\u0027t want anything to ever go wrong for you.\"\n \"Nothing will.\" She put her hand on his. \"You\u0027re my safety net.\"\n \"I\u0027ll always be there.\" He squeezed her hand.\n Two weeks went by, and Lara had not heard from Philip Adler. She sent for Keller. \"Did you make that ten-thousand dollar contribution to the Adler Foundation?\"\n \"Yes, the day you mentioned it.\"\n \"Strange. I would have thought he would have called me.\"\n Keller shrugged. \"He\u0027s probably traveling somewhere.\"\n \"Probably.\" She tried to conceal her disappointment. \"Let\u0027s talk about the building in Queens.\"\n \"That\u0027s going to take a big financial bite out of us,\" Keller said.\n \"I know how to protect us. I\u0027d like to lock the deal in with one tenant.\"\n \"Do you have anyone in mind?\"\n \"Yes. Mutual Security Insurance. The president is a man named Horace Guttman. I\u0027ve heard they\u0027re looking for a new location. I\u0027d like it to be our building.\"\n \"I\u0027ll check it out,\" Keller said.\n Lara noticed that he made no notes. \"You constantly amaze me. You remember everything, don\u0027t you?\"\n Keller grinned. \"I have a photographic memory. It used to be for baseball statistics.\" It all seems so long ago, Howard thought. The kid with the magic arm, the star of the Chicago Cubs minor league. Someone else and another time. \"Sometimes it\u0027s a curse. There are a few things in my life I\u0027d like to forget.\"\n \"Howard, have the architect go ahead and draw up the plans for the Queens building. Find out how many floors Mutual Security will need, and how much floor space.\"\n Two days later Keller walked into Lara\u0027s office. \"I\u0027m afraid I have some bad news.\"\n \"What\u0027s the problem?\"\n \"I did a little snooping around. You were right about Mutual Security Insurance. They are looking for a new headquarters, but Guttman is thinking about a building in Union Square. It\u0027s your old friend Steve Murchison\u0027s building.\"\n Murchison again! She was sure that the box of dirt had been sent by him. I\u0027m not going to let him bluff me.\n \"Has Guttman committed to it?\" Lara asked.\n \"Not yet.\"\n \"All right. I\u0027ll handle it.\"\n That afternoon Lara made a dozen phone calls. She hit the jackpot on the last call. Barbara Roswell.\n \"Horace Guttman? Sure, I know him, Lara. What\u0027s your interest in him?\"\n \"I\u0027d like to meet him. I\u0027m a big fan of his. I want you to do me a favor. Could you please invite him to dinner next Saturday night, Barbara?\"\n \"You\u0027ve got it.\"\n The dinner party was simple but elegant. There were fourteen people at the Roswell residence. Alice Guttman wasn\u0027t feeling well that evening, so Horace Guttman had come to the party alone. Lara had been seated next to him. He was in his sixties, but he seemed much older. He had a stern, worn face and a stubborn chin. Lara looked enchanting, provocative. She was wearing a low-cut black Halston gown and simple but stunning jewelry. They had had their cocktails and were seated at the dining table.\n \"I\u0027ve been wanting to meet you,\" Lara confessed. \"I\u0027ve heard so much about you.\"\n \"I\u0027ve heard a lot about you, young lady. You\u0027ve made quite a splash in this town.\"\n \"I hope I\u0027m making a contribution,\" Lara said modestly. \"It\u0027s such a wonderful town.\"\n \"Where are you from?\"\n \"Gary, Indiana.\"\n \"Really?\" He looked at her in surprise. \"That\u0027s where I was born. So, you\u0027re a Hoosier, eh?\"\n Lara smiled. \"That\u0027s right. I have such fond memories of Gary. My father worked for the Post-Tribune. I went to Roosevelt High. On weekends we\u0027d go to Gleason Park for picnics and outdoor concerts, or we\u0027d go bowling at the Twelve and Twenty. I hated having to leave.\"\n \"You\u0027ve done well for yourself, Miss Cameron.\"\n \"Lara.\"\n \"Lara. What are you up to these days?\"\n \"The project I\u0027m most excited about,\" Lara told him, \"is a new building I\u0027m putting up in Queens. It\u0027s going to have thirty stories and two hundred thousand square feet of floor space.\"\n \"That\u0027s interesting,\" Guttman said, thoughtfully.\n \"Oh,\" Lara said innocently. \"Why?\"\n \"It happens that we\u0027re looking for a building just about that size for our new headquarters.\"\n \"Really? Have you chosen one yet?\"\n \"Not exactly, but...\"\n \"If you\u0027d like, I can show you the plans for our new building. They\u0027ve already been drawn up.\"\n He studied her a moment. \"Yes, I\u0027d like to see them.\"\n \"I can bring them to your office Monday morning.\"\n \"I\u0027ll look forward to it.\"\n The rest of the evening went well.\n When Horace Guttman reached home that night, he walked into his wife\u0027s bedroom.\n \"How are you feeling?\" he asked.\n \"Better, darling. How was the party?\"\n He sat down on the bed. \"Well, they all missed you, but I had an interesting time. Have you ever heard of Lara Cameron?\"\n \"Certainly. Everyone has heard of Lara Cameron.\"\n \"She\u0027s quite a woman. A little strange. Says she was born in Gary, Indiana, same as me. Knew all about Gary - Gleason Park and the Twelve and Twenty.\"\n \"What\u0027s strange about that?\"\n Guttman looked at his wife and grinned. \"The little lady comes from Nova Scotia.\"\n Early Monday morning Lara appeared at Horace Guttman\u0027s office, carrying the blueprints for the Queens project. She was ushered in immediately.\n \"Nice to see you, Lara. Sit down.\"\n She laid the blueprints on his desk and sat across from him.\n \"Before you look at these,\" Lara said, \"I have something to confess, Horace.\"\n Guttman leaned back in his chair. \"Yes?\"\n \"That story I told on Saturday about Gary, Indiana...\"\n \"What about it?\"\n \"I\u0027ve never even been to Gary, Indiana. I was trying to impress you.\"\n He laughed. \"Now you\u0027ve succeeded in confusing me. I\u0027m not sure I\u0027m going to be able to keep up with you, young lady. Let\u0027s look at these blueprints.\"\n Half an hour later he was through examining them.\n \"You know,\" he said reflectively,\" I was pretty well set on another location.\"\n \"Were you?\"\n \"Why should I change my mind and move into your building?\"\n \"Because you\u0027re going to be happier there. I\u0027ll see that you have everything you need.\" She smiled. \"Besides, it\u0027s going to cost your company ten percent less.\"\n \"Really? You don\u0027t know what my deal is for the other building.\"\n \"It doesn\u0027t matter. I\u0027ll take your word for it.\"\n \"You could have come from Gary, Indiana,\" Guttman said. \"You\u0027ve got a deal.\"\n When Lara returned to her office, there was a message that Philip Adler had telephoned. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-stars-shine-down/page-18.html","bookId":2364,"book":{"id":2364,"title":"The Stars Shine Down","description":"Storyline: \n Lara Cameron is a famous powerful wealthy New York building developer who struggled from brutal poverty in Glace Bay, a banker who took her body as part of her first deal, to Chicago, banker Keller whose love she takes lightly for granted.
