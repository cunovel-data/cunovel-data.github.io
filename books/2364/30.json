{"id":68817,"no":30,"title":"Page 30","content":"BOOK FOUR Chapter Thirty Lara received the news about Philip in Reno. Marian Bell was on the phone, near hysteria. \"Is he badly hurt?\" Lara demanded. \"We don\u0027t have any details yet. He\u0027s at Roosevelt Hospital in the emergency room.\" \"I\u0027ll come back immediately.\" When Lara arrived at the hospital six hours later, Howard Keller was waiting there for her. He looked shaken. \"What happened?\" Lara asked. \"Apparently, Philip was mugged after he left Carnegie Hall. They found him in the street, unconscious.\" \"How bad is it?\" \"His wrist was slashed. He\u0027s heavily sedated, but he\u0027s conscious.\" They went into the hospital room. Philip was lying on a bed with IV tubes feeding liquid into his body. \"Philip...Philip.\" It was Lara\u0027s voice calling to him from a long way off. He opened his eyes. Lara and Howard Keller were there. There seemed to be two of each. His mouth was dry, and he felt groggy. \"What happened?\" Philip mumbled. \"You were hurt,\" Lara said. \"But you\u0027re going to be all right.\" Philip looked down and saw that his left wrist was heavily bandaged. Memory came flooding back. \"I was...how bad is it?\" \"I don\u0027t know, darling,\" Lara said. \"I\u0027m sure it will be fine. The doctor is coming in to see you.\" Keller said reassuringly, \"Doctors can do anything these days.\" Philip was drifting back to sleep. \"I told him to take what he wanted. He shouldn\u0027t have hurt my wrist,\" he mumbled. \"He shouldn\u0027t have hurt my wrist...\" Two hours later Dr. Dennis Stanton walked into Philip\u0027s room, and the moment Philip saw the expression on his face he knew what he was going to say. Philip took a deep breath. \"Tell me.\" Dr. Stanton sighed. \"I\u0027m afraid I don\u0027t have very good news for you, Mr. Adler.\" \"How bad is it?\" \"The flexor tendons have been severed, so you\u0027ll have no motion in your hand, and there will be a permanent numbness. In addition to that, there\u0027s median and ulnar nerve damage.\" He illustrated on his hand. \"The median nerve affects the thumb and first three fingers. The ulnar nerve goes to all the fingers.\" Philip closed his eyes tightly against the wave of sudden despair that engulfed him. After a moment he spoke. \"Are you saying that I\u0027ll...I\u0027ll never have the use of my left hand again?\" \"That\u0027s right. The fact is that you\u0027re lucky to be alive. Whoever did this cut the artery. It\u0027s a wonder you didn\u0027t bleed to death. It took sixty stitches to sew your wrist together again.\" Philip said in desperation, \"My God, isn\u0027t there anything you can do?\" \"Yes. We could put in an implant in your left hand so you would have some motion, but it would be very limited.\" He might as well have killed me, Philip thought despairingly. \"As your hand starts to heal, there\u0027s going to be a great deal of pain. We\u0027ll give you medication to control it, but I can assure you that in time the pain will go away.\" Not the real pain, Philip thought. Not the real pain. He was caught up in a nightmare. And there was no escape. A detective came to see Philip at the hospital. He stood by the side of Philip\u0027s bed. He was one of the old breed, in his sixties and tired, with eyes that had already seen it all twice. \"I\u0027m Lieutenant Mancini. I\u0027m sorry about what happened, Mr. Adler,\" he said. \"It\u0027s too bad they couldn\u0027t have broken your leg instead. I mean...if it had to happen...\" \"I know what you mean,\" Philip said curtly. Howard Keller came into the room. \"I was looking for Lara.\" He saw the stranger. \"Oh, sorry.\" \"She\u0027s around here somewhere,\" Philip said. \"This is Lieutenant Mancini. Howard Keller.\" Mancini was staring at him. \"You look familiar. Have we met before?\" \"I don\u0027t think so.\" Mancini\u0027s face lit up. \"Keller! My God, you used to play baseball in Chicago.\" \"That\u0027s right. How do you...?\" \"I was a scout for the Cubs one summer. I still remember your sliders and your change-ups. You could have had a big career.\" \"Yeah. Well, if you\u0027ll excuse me...\" He looked at Philip. \"I\u0027ll wait for Lara outside.\" He left. Mancini turned to Philip. \"Did you get a look at the man who attacked you?\" \"He was a male Caucasian. A large man. About six foot two. Maybe fifty or so.\" \"Could you identify him if you saw him again?\" \"Yes.\" It was a face he would never forget. \"Mr. Adler, I could ask you to look through a lot of mug shots, but frankly, I think it would be a waste of your time. I mean, this isn\u0027t exactly a high-tech crime. There are hundreds of muggers all over the city. Unless someone nabs them on the spot, they usually get away with it.\" He took out his notebook. \"What was taken from you?\" \"My wallet and my wristwatch.\" \"What kind of watch was it?\" \"A Piaget.\" \"Was there anything distinctive about it? Did it have an inscription, for example?\" It was the watch Lara had given him. \"Yes. On the back of the case, it read \u0027To Philip with Love from Lara.\u0027 \" He made a note. \"Mr. Adler...I have to ask you this. Had you ever seen this man before?\" Philip looked up at him in surprise. \"Seen him before? No. Why?\" \"I just wondered.\" Mancini put the notebook away. \"Well, we\u0027ll see what we can do. You\u0027re a lucky man, Mr. Adler.\" \"Really?\" Philip\u0027s voice was filled with bitterness. \"Yeah. We have thousands of muggings a year in this city, and we can\u0027t afford to spend much time on them, but our captain happens to be a fan of yours. He collects all your records. He\u0027s going to do everything he can to catch the SOB who did this to you. We\u0027ll send out a description of your watch to pawnshops around the country.\" \"If you catch him, do you think he can give me my hand back?\" Philip asked bitterly. \"What?\" \"Nothing.\" \"You\u0027ll be hearing from us. Have a nice day.\" Lara and Keller were waiting in the corridor for the detective. \"You said you wanted to see me?\" Lara asked. \"Yes. I\u0027d like to ask you a couple of questions,\" Lieutenant Mancini said. \"Mrs. Adler, does your husband have any enemies that you know of?\" Lara frowned. \"Enemies? No. Why?\" \"No one who might be jealous of him? Another musician maybe? Someone who wants to hurt him?\" \"What are you getting at? It was a simple street mugging, wasn\u0027t it?\" \"To be perfectly frank, this doesn\u0027t fit the pattern of an ordinary mugging. He slashed your husband\u0027s wrist after he took his wallet and watch.\" \"I don\u0027t see what difference...\" \"That was a pretty senseless thing to do, unless it was deliberate. Your husband didn\u0027t put up any resistance. Now, a kid on dope might do a thing like that, but...\" He shrugged. \"I\u0027ll be in touch.\" They watched him walk away. \"Jesus!\" Keller said. \"He thinks it was a setup.\" Lara had turned pale. Keller looked at her and said slowly, \"My God! One of Paul Martin\u0027s hoods! But why would he do this?\" Lara found it difficult to speak. \"He...he might have thought he was doing it for me. Philip has...has been away a lot, and Paul kept saying that it...it wasn\u0027t right, that someone should have a talk with him. Oh, Howard!\" She buried her head in his shoulder, fighting back the tears. \"That son of a bitch! I warned you to stay away from that man.\" Lara took a deep breath. \"Philip is going to be all right. He has to be.\" Three days later Lara brought Philip home from the hospital. He looked pale and shaken. Marian Bell was at the door, waiting for them. She had gone to the hospital every day to see Philip and to bring him his messages. There had been an outpouring of sympathy from all around the world - cards and letters and telephone calls from distraught fans. The newspapers had played the story up, condemning the violence on the streets of New York. Lara was in the library when the telephone rang. \"It\u0027s for you,\" Marian Bell said. \"A Mr. Paul Martin.\" \"I...I can\u0027t talk to him,\" Lara told her. And she stood there, fighting to keep her body from trembling.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-stars-shine-down/page-30.html","bookId":2364,"book":{"id":2364,"title":"The Stars Shine Down","description":"Storyline: Lara Cameron is a famous powerful wealthy New York building developer who struggled from brutal poverty in Glace Bay, a banker who took her body as part of her first deal, to Chicago, banker Keller whose love she takes lightly for granted.
