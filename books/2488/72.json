You got the son of a bitch. I owe you a twelve-pack, detective.”\n “It’s not over yet. The bombs are coming and this asshole won’t call them off.”\n Owen spoke up and said, “Why don’t we start feeding his feet into the fuckin’ wood chipper, see if that changes his mind.”\n Tennet said, “All right, all right. Give me the mic.”\n Falconer handed it to him. Tennet yanked, ripping the wire out of the console, and tossed the mic onto the ground.\n Falconer growled, smashed the butt of his gun into Tennet’s face and threw the man to the ground. Falconer followed him down, straddling his chest, punching him over and over.\n I said, “Should we, uh, stop him?”\n John said, “Nope.”\n 9 Minutes Until the Aerial Bombing of Undisclosed\n Marconi walked up and said, “Why do I have the feeling I am not going to receive my consultant’s fee for this project?”\n I said, “Everybody is so freaking droll today. Jesus.”\n John said, “Well, what the hell do we do now?”\n To Amy, Marconi said, “You have one of those fancy cell phones, correct? One that can capture video?”\n She said, “Yep,” and pulled it out.\n “You have a signal, correct? And access to the Internet?”\n “Sure, sure.”\n Somebody in the crowd said, “Look! There’s a plane! To the north! They’re coming!”\n I turned. There was a speck in the sky, that even from this far away I could tell was not our friendly Predator drone coming back to rescue us somehow. Not sure what it would have done anyway. This was a big bastard, with propellers on the wings, one of the big cargo planes you always saw on the news hauling troops back and forth to the Middle East.\n Marconi asked, “And you can stream video? Meaning you can capture video and upload it live?”\n “Yeah. What am I recording?”\n Marconi sighed and said, “Our deaths.”\n 8 Minutes Until the Aerial Bombing of Undisclosed\n I said, “What? That’s your plan?”\n He stuffed his hands in his pockets and gave me a sad look through the rain.\n “What’s that around your lady friend’s neck?”\n I didn’t have to look at her to answer. It was always there.\n “What, her necklace? The crucifix?”\n “Think about it. What I said before, back at quarantine. The—”\n “The Babylonian Bureau. Yes. Goddamnit we don’t have time—”\n “The sacrifice, David. That is how mankind overcomes the Babel Threshold. Our little tribal circles, bound by social contracts and selfish mutual need. Everyone working in their own greedy self-interests and huddling together with their tribe, at war with all those outside who they regard as barely human. What breaks a human mind out of that iron cage of mistrust, is a sacrifice. The martyr who gives up everything, who abandons all personal gain, who lays down his very life for the good of those outside his group. He becomes a symbol all can rally around. So instead of trying to make a selfish, violent primate somehow empathize with the whole world, which is impossible, you only need to get him to remember and love the martyr. As one is forgotten, another must replace it. Unfortunately, as I feared, today that is to be us.”\n The plane grew on the horizon. Two more appeared in the distance behind it. I could hear the ever-so-faint buzz of its engines. Appropriately enough, they sounded like bees. Just like Tennet had said. A swarm of bees, attacking a … hamburger I guess.\n Amy was staring at me, eyes wide. Owen and Cowboy looked befuddled. Falconer was standing over an unconscious Tennet, his fists bloody, eyes defiant.\n 7 Minutes Until the Aerial Bombing of Undisclosed\n John said, “Fuck that bullshit. Everybody in the truck, we’re heading out.”\n Marconi said, “So we ride to safety, while the tens of thousands who remain in the city behind us burn? And then what? We drive out across the buffer zone outside those barricades, and a few miles later you will meet another, larger barricade, manned by the U.S. military. Martyrdom isn’t something you choose. It is thrust upon you.”\n Amy said, “Oh! Wait! Ohmygod it’s so simple. We just—okay, we just have to get to an open area. Between us and the plane, so he sees it—the cornfield! Everybody go to the cornfield!”\n To John, she said, “Get on the, uh, the speaker thing in the truck! Tell everybody to go to the cornfield!”\n We didn’t need to tell anybody anything. Hundreds of people were flowing past us, through the ruined barricades, the city draining out through the highway like water.\n We piled into the truck, managed to get it turned around without running over a dozen people, and rumbled off toward the cornfield.\n On the way, Amy said, “The plane! Oh God I can’t believe I didn’t think of this! It’s flying low, under the clouds! We can see it! So it can see us!”\n “I don’t understand how that—”\n “The pilot thinks we’re zombies. We just have to show him we’re not.”\n 5 Minutes Until the Aerial Bombing of Undisclosed\n We rumbled to a stop in the field, refugees of Undisclosed scattering past us, on foot and in trucks and on bicycles, heading off toward the second military cordon that I was pretty sure most of them didn’t realize was there. What did they think they would find out there? Their out-of-town loved ones, waiting for them with a six-pack? The president, with an apology bouquet?\n John took to the loudspeaker and said, “WE GOT ABOUT FIVE MINUTES TO PULL THIS SHIT OFF, SO LISTEN UP. GATHER AROUND. WE ARE GOING TO SPELL OUT A MESSAGE FOR THE PILOT OF THAT PLANE UP THERE. HE DOESN’T KNOW WHAT HE’S ABOUT TO BOMB. WE ARE GONNA SHOW HIS DUMB ASS.”\n We all bailed out of the truck. The pickup carrying Owen, the Cowboy and Marconi, which upon further reflection is totally a cop show I would watch, pulled up alongside.\n I glanced nervously up at the plane and said, “Son of a bitch. We don’t have time, we don’t have time—”\n John said, “It has to be something simple! Like ‘HELP’ or something!”\n “WE DON’T HAVE TIME TO FORM FOUR FUCKING LETTERS, JOHN!”\n Marconi said, “You don’t need letters, David. You need a symbol. One that man up there is sure to recognize.” Marconi nodded toward Amy.\n John said, “Right! He’s right!” John ran off, stopped a group of women and said, “Stand in a line! Right here! Hurry! You! Over there! Stand here! COME ON, GODDAMNIT, WE NEED AT LEAST A HUNDRED PEOPLE! MOVE!”\n * TRANSCRIPT OF AN EXCHANGE BETWEEN CAPTAIN PABLO VASQUEZ (SPEARHEAD), PILOT OF AN MC-130 H TALON II, LEAD AIRCRAFT IN OPERATION LEPPARD, AND COPILOT CAPTAIN LAWRENCE MCDONNEL (STALLION) AT 11:59, NOVEMBER 15TH *\n Spearhead: Loadmaster, we are six-zero seconds from primary payload release. Prepare to open bay doors, on my mark—\n Stallion: Hey, uh, take a look at the barricade area. On the road, the uh, highway—\n Spearhead: I see it.\n Stallion: We have a, uh, crowd forming, are those REPER?\n Spearhead: Negative.\n Stallion: Friendlies Evac should have been completed by—\n Spearhead: Negative, those are not REPER.\n Stallion: Jesus, are we looking at Zulus here?\n Spearhead: Affirmative, I’m seeing overturned vehicles and debris, it looks like the barricade has been overrun.\n Spearhead: Will the blast get them out there?\n Spearhead: Affirmative. Loadmaster, we are now three-zero seconds from primary payload release. Opening bay doors now.\n Stallion: Look. Down at the uh, that area to the east of the highway. In that field.\n Spearhead: Copy that, there is a crowd forming in the field—\n Stallion: Look. Look how they’re standing.\n Spearhead: Is that—\n Stallion: Look at the rows, they’re perfect rows—\n Spearhead: They’re almost forming the shape of—\n Stallion: It’s not almost. It’s perfect, it’s too perfect a shape—\n Spearhead: All right. This is—Uh, Command, this is Spearhead, do you read me? We, uh, I don’t believe what I’m seeing here, but we are observing a crowd of Zulus less than a kilometer outside of the target area and they are standing, uh, they are standing in the shape of a human penis. I repeat, the Zulus have organized themselves into a perfect shape of a human penis in an open field below us. We are looking at this with our own eyes.\n Stallion: They are not Zulus.\n 30 Seconds Until the Aerial Bombing of Undisclosed\n We stood there, in the field, shivering in the rain, in the shape of the dick John had formed us into. Dr. Marconi was to one side of me, looking disapproving. Amy was in my arms, her eyes turned upward, rain bouncing off her glasses. She was praying.\n The cargo plane growled toward us, swooping lower, so low that I wondered how the thing expected to escape its own explosion.\n Amy closed her eyes and buried her face in my chest and said, “I love you.”\n “I love you, too.”\n “It’s turning! Look!”\n The hulking plane banked, making a gentle turn in the sky and veering away from the town. We nervously watched it humming off into the distance, making a wide circle to head back the way it came.\n A cheer went up in the crowd around us. There were five planes in the formation, and we watched as one after another they peeled off and circled back.\n Falconer walked up and said, “I just want to say right now that this is the stupidest shit I’ve ever been involved in.”\n John said, “Hey, you don’t have to like our methods, but you can’t argue with the result. Everything turned out okay, right?”\n 10 Seconds Until the Aerial Bombing of Undisclosed\n Amy said, “Why isn’t that plane turning back?”\n The trailing plane in the formation was not, in fact, changing its course. It growled straight through the air, swooping right over us. The crowd all watched it glide into the distance, heading toward the part of town that had become home to the quarantine. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/this-book-is-full-of-spiders-john-dies-at-the-end-2/page-72.html","bookId":2488,"book":{"id":2488,"title":"This Book Is Full of Spiders (John Dies at the End #2)","description":"Storyline: \n This Book Is Full of Spiders: Seriously, Dude, Don\u0027t Touch It (John Dies at the End #2) \n You will dismiss this as ridiculous fearmongering. Dismissing things as ridiculous fearmongering is, in fact, the first symptom of parasitic spider infection-the creature secretes a chemical into the brain to stimulate skepticism, in order to prevent you from seeking a cure. That\u0027s just as well, since the \"cure\" involves learning what a chain saw tastes like. \n You can\u0027t feel the spider, because it controls your nerve endings. You can\u0027t see it, because it decides what you see. You won\u0027t even feel it when it breeds. And it will breed. So what happens when your family, friends, and neighbors get mind-controlling skull spiders? We\u0027re all about to find out. \n Just stay calm, and remember that telling you about the spider situation is not the same as having caused it. I\u0027m just the messenger. Even if I did sort of cause it. \n Either way, I won\u0027t hold it against you if you\u0027re upset.
