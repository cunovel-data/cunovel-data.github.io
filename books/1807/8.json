Weren’t you dispatched to off one out there earlier this season?” Nick asked. “I was. This one was its mate,” Rune said. Nick tisked. “Shame on you, little brother. And here I thought we raised you better than to miss monsters. That’s sloppy work. Aren’t you disappointed too, Mikk?” Mikk, the older, more serious, and less talkative of the twins, ignored Nick. “Will you return after killing it?” “I plan to stay at Carabas for a few days. I mean to make sure there were no hatchinglings. Is there something you want me to look into?” Rune asked. “No,” Mikk said. “Have you two talked to Father recently?” Nick asked, folding his arms across his massive chest. “Yes,” Elise said. “Did he seem a little odd?” Nick asked. “What do you mean by odd?” Rune asked. “Acting out of character, staring blankly into space, being easily distracted, things like that. Right, Mikk?” Nick said. “Yes,” Mikk said, a stony frown etched on his lips as he stared Elise down. Elise resisted the urge to squirm under Mikk’s rocky stare. She never felt that Mikk disliked her, as Falk and Gerhart seemed to, but she suspected she did not measure up to his expectations, and he seemed to vaguely disapprove of her. Whenever she was with him, there was an extra layer of pressure in the air. “Perhaps, yes,” Elise said. “The past few times I have spoken to him, he has been distracted. I usually have to make a loud noise to get his attention.” “You think something is wrong?” Rune asked. “We’re not certain. Our line of business tends to breed paranoia, but it’s always best to be on your toes,” Nick said, tapping his broken nose. Elise and the royal siblings grimly stared at each other, but the seriousness of the moment was broken by a peal of tittering laughter that echoed up the stairwell. “You wound me, My Lady, with your laughter. I am serious!” “But you cannot be.” “But I am. I would positively perish if not for seeing your bright smile every day, Lady Meinhilde.” “Prince Gerhart, you are too charming!” “Please, call me Hart.” The male flirt was the youngest of the royal siblings, Prince Gerhart. He was an angel-faced teenager with curly hair and deceptively innocent eyes. He pushed and peddled his charms as part of his training for his future with the Foreign Affairs Department. “Prince Gerhart, I could never take such liberties.” “Even when I beg you to? I would be delighted to hear my nickname uttered by such sweet lips.” Elise shook her head as Mikk’s lips flattened in great disapproval. Nick, however, took action. He leaned over the banister and called in a loud yodel, “Gerhie! There you are, you naughty boy. Come up and wish your big brother Rune goodbye. He’s leaving, you know. Gerhie! Why won’t you look at me?” Elise and Rune stifled laughter as they watched their younger brother’s expression change from sophistication to mortification. Gerhart bowed and made an excuse to his female companion before bounding up the stairs, taking them two at a time. “Was that necessary?” he snarled. “Of course it was, Gerhie. You wouldn’t want to miss saying farewell to your dashing, heroic brother. Would you?” Nick asked, batting his eyelashes—a ridiculous gesture given his girth and size. “Don’t call me Gerhie!” Gerhart said. “Temper, temper. If you don’t learn to control your emotions, you’ll never be as popular with the ladies as Rune is,” Nick said. Gerhart plunged his hands into his thick hair as if he wanted to pull it out of his scalp. He jumped when Rune placed a hand on his shoulder. “Take care, Gerhart.” “You’re really leaving then?” Gerhart asked. “I am.” “Good. I’ll return to being number one in the social scene,” Gerhart nodded. “Only if the black horse doesn’t rear his head,” Nick said. “Falk is antisocial. He has admirers, but I am liked by all,” Gerhart said, puffing up his chest. “True, you and the Perfect Princess are the court darlings,” Nick said, ruffling Gerhart’s hair. “Get off! And I am certainly above Elise’s level of popularity,” Gerhart said, disdain dripping from his words. “Spoiled brat,” Mikk said. “Am not,” Gerhart said, folding his arms. “I’m off. I need to leave or I won’t make it to Carabas by dark. Brothers, take care. Elise, don’t overwork yourself,” Rune said, hugging Elise. “Goodbye, Rune,” Elise and her foster brothers chorused as Rune trotted down the stairs, heading for the entrance of Castle Brandis where his horse waited. “That was touching. So, who is up for a round of cards?” Nick asked.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-wild-swans-timeless-fairy-tales-2/page-8.html","bookId":1807,"book":{"id":1807,"title":"The Wild Swans (Timeless Fairy Tales #2)","description":"Storyline: Elise is the foster-daughter of the King of Arcainia, a mathematician, and the country’s treasurer.
