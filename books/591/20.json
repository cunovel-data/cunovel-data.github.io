{"id":9227,"no":20,"title":"THE LITTLE CREATURES OF THE WOODS ARE HAPPY AGAIN","content":"When the little creatures of the Big Green Woods looked toward Farmer Roe’s house, they saw Doctor Rabbit behind a fence post, watching. \\n\\n \\n\\n Yes, it was true: Ki-yi Coyote was in that box! They knew it because several times they heard Farmer Roe’s boy say, “We got him! I was sure he would come out in the night!” \\n\\n \\n\\n Then the little creatures of the Big Green Woods wondered what Farmer Roe was doing. He went into the barn several times and brought out some boards, a hammer, and a saw. First he sawed the boards, and then he hammered and nailed ever so long. \\n\\n \\n\\n After a while all the little creatures[Pg 104] of the Big Green Woods could see what Farmer Roe was doing. He was making a kind of wood and wire cage for Ki-yi Coyote. When it was all ready, Farmer Roe and his son put the cage against the box that Ki-yi Coyote was in. Then Farmer Roe’s boy poked Ki-yi with a long stick and drove him into the cage. Then as the farmer and his boy stood looking at dusty Ki-yi in the cage, they talked for quite a long time; but the little creatures of the Big Green Woods could not hear what was said. At last Farmer Roe and his boy went into the house. Then wise Doctor Rabbit came running back to the woods and said it was mighty fine the way things were turning out. \\n\\n \\n\\n “They are going to load Ki-yi Coyote into a wagon, take him to the city, and sell him to the men who have charge of[Pg 105] a big park there,” said Doctor Rabbit excitedly. \\n\\n \\n\\n “That’s fine! Splendid!” shouted all the little creatures of the Big Green Woods. “Hurrah for Doctor Rabbit and his scheme for getting rid of Ki-yi Coyote!” \\n\\n \\n\\n “And now,” shouted Cheepy Chipmunk, mounting a stump and speaking so that all could hear, “I want you all to come right down to my house for dinner. Mother Chipmunk wants all of you!” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Fine!” shouted Jimmy Chipmunk. “I’ll get something good to eat, because company’s coming!” His mother frowned at him, but no one thought anything about what Jimmy had said, they were so delighted to get the invitation; because Mother Chipmunk was about the best cook in the whole woods. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 106]Then away they all went toward Cheepy Chipmunk’s house, talking and laughing and shouting. And Billy Rabbit and Jimmy Chipmunk and Johnny Woodchuck kicked up their heels and ran after each other all the way, they were so happy. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was a fine thing, they all said, to be going to such a good dinner, and to know that Ki-yi Coyote would not trouble them any more. They declared that they had never been so happy in all their lives before. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2325/65042.html","bookId":591,"book":{"id":591,"title":"Doctor Rabbit and Ki-Yi Coyote","description":"简介： Doctor Rabbit lived in the very biggest tree in the Big Green Woods.
