{"id":9228,"no":21,"title":"WHAT UNCLE OWL WHISPERED","content":"Didn’t you ever wish and wish and wish that you could know what the squirrel is chattering about, and what the cricket is saying when he sings his chirpy little song, and what the big owl really means when he says “Whoo-whoo-oo”? Lucky Peter Patter does know, for all the animals tell him funny things; and the best part of it is that Peter isn’t selfish! He has told all his charming little rimes to Leroy F. Jackson, who has let Rand McNally \u0026 Company print them in a beautiful big book, with pictures by Blanche Fisher Wright. You can find it in any bookstore for $1.50. Its name is The Peter Patter Book. Don’t you like Peter’s picture? \\n\\n \\n\\n IN THE CIRCUS TENT \\n\\n \\n\\n “If I was a bear,” boasted Jack, as they walked past the animal cages in the circus tent, “and strong as strong, I wouldn’t stay in a cage and go round with a circus. I’d live in the woods.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “If I was a tiger,” echoed Nancy, “and could creepy-crawl like a big cat, I’d never let ’em put me in a circus.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “If you’d like to know why they’re all here,” said Mother, with a smile, “we’ll stop on the way home and buy Elizabeth Gale’s stories about How the Animals Came to the Circus. Warner Carr drew the pictures and Rand McNally \u0026 Company made the book, and we can get it at any shop for 50 cents.” \\n\\n \\n\\n THE CAT THAT FIDDLED \\n\\n \\n\\n You’ve known Tom, the Piper’s son, for a long, long time, but did you ever know that he had a pet cat which fiddled so merrily that even the King just couldn’t keep his feet still? And did you know that Little Miss Muffet had a Mother who had an Aunt who could be cured of a sick-a-bed illness only by eating hot buttered muffins? And did you know—O, ever so many more things about your Mother Goose friends? If you didn’t, let Louise A. Garnett and James McCracken tell you in The Merrymakers. Rand McNally \u0026 Company have made their rimes and pictures into a book which you may buy in the shops for $1.00. \\n\\n \\n\\n OPEN YOUR EYES! \\n\\n \\n\\n Perhaps you didn’t know it, but the Little People who are so busy making the seed babies lie straight in their beds and driving off Jack Frost when he wants to nip the snowball blossoms love to talk to all children. But many children—would you believe it?—shut their ears and eyes and never hear them or even see them. Loraine was different, and they told her the most delightful things. Maybe it will help you to see and hear these Little People if you read about them in a book called Loraine and the Little People of Spring. Elizabeth Gordon and Rand McNally \u0026 Company made the book, which you may buy in any bookstore for 50 cents. \\n\\n \\n\\n The End \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2325/65043.html","bookId":591,"book":{"id":591,"title":"Doctor Rabbit and Ki-Yi Coyote","description":"简介： Doctor Rabbit lived in the very biggest tree in the Big Green Woods.
