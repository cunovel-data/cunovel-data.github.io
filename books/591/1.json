{"id":9208,"no":1,"title":"DOCTOR RABBIT GETS A CALL","content":"Doctor Rabbit lived in the very biggest tree in the Big Green Woods. He looked after all the other rabbits when they were ill and he doctored quite a number of the other little creatures of the Big Woods too, when they did not feel well. He was so jolly and cheerful, always trying so hard to help others, that he had a great many friends. \\n\\n \\n\\n Doctor Rabbit said when he came to live in the Big Green Woods he didn’t have the least idea that he would have so many adventures. “But then,” he said one day as he curled his mustache, “it’s[Pg 2] a good thing I have so many adventures. They make me take plenty of exercise, and that’s fine for my constitution.” What he meant by this was that exercise kept him in good health. \\n\\n \\n\\n I said Doctor Rabbit looked after some of the other creatures when they were ill. But there were some he did not dare go near. Well, I should say not! For instance, there was Ki-yi Coyote, who lived out on the Wide Prairie just outside the Big Green Woods. No, Doctor Rabbit never went near Ki-yi Coyote. And if old Ki-yi had been ill and if all his relatives had been so ill they never again would be able to get out of bed, Doctor Rabbit would not have cared at all. No indeed, he would have been glad of it, because Ki-yi Coyote and all his relatives, who lived far away, were ready any time to gobble up Doctor Rabbit. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 3]Now, one fine morning in spring Doctor Rabbit began to have trouble with Ki-yi. On this morning Doctor Rabbit arose from his bed very early and prepared a fine breakfast for himself. He cooked some nice new potatoes and green peas he had found in Farmer Roe’s garden. After he had eaten his breakfast he had to wash the dishes because there wasn’t anybody else to do it. You see, he lived all alone in the big tree. He didn’t like to wash dishes but he did it anyway. Then he put on his second best pair of glasses and went out in his front yard to get some fresh air and see if his neighbor, Blue Jay, was up. \\n\\n \\n\\n There was a very good reason why he wanted to know whether Blue Jay was up. Just now Doctor Rabbit was greatly troubled. Now, what do you suppose he was troubled about? Why, word had[Pg 4] been brought the night before that Billy Rabbit, the small son of Jack and Mrs. Jack Rabbit, who lived far out on the Wide Prairie, was ill. Blue Jay had come flying in to tell the news. He said Mrs. Jack Rabbit told him if Billy was not better by morning Doctor Rabbit would simply have to cross the Wide Prairie even if it was dangerous. \\n\\n \\n\\n Now Doctor Rabbit was a cottontail rabbit, so of course he couldn’t run faster than any other cottontail. He could not run anything like so fast nor so far as could Jack Rabbit. So Doctor Rabbit was greatly troubled this morning. He could not sit still, but kept walking slowly round and round in his front yard. As he walked round and round he said to himself, “I’ve never been so far out on the open Wide Prairie as Jack Rabbit’s. Suppose I should go away out[Pg 5] there to see little sick Billy and Ki-yi Coyote should get after me! Goodness gracious! He would be almost sure to catch me.” Doctor Rabbit trembled a little and looked all around even though he was right in his own dooryard. He very much hoped he would not be called to go so far out on the Wide Prairie. \\n\\n \\n\\n But what he feared happened. Very soon Jack Rabbit came running fast, and flying right along with him came Blue Jay. Busy Blue Jay generally knows everything that is happening. \\n\\n \\n\\n Jack Rabbit walked straight up to Doctor Rabbit and, bowing politely, said: \\n\\n \\n\\n “I’m so glad I found you at home, Doctor. My son Billy is no better. In fact, he is much worse, and we are troubled about him. Can’t you run over and see him right now?” \\n\\n \\n\\n For a moment Doctor Rabbit did not[Pg 6] know what to say. He feared Ki-yi Coyote, but at the same time he hated to think of Billy Rabbit’s being so ill with no one there to make him well. He thought and thought. Finally he said: \\n\\n \\n\\n “Of course, Friend Jack Rabbit, I shall try to get over to see your son. But as you know, it’s very dangerous for me because I can’t run more than half as fast as you can. Now what could we do if old Ki-yi Coyote should happen to get after us?” \\n\\n \\n\\n Friend Jack Rabbit scratched his head and said he hadn’t thought about that. It was a very serious matter, too. For suppose Ki-yi Coyote should gobble up good Doctor Rabbit! Then what would the woods creatures do? They must certainly plan some means of going in safety. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Say!” said Doctor Rabbit suddenly, “I’ve thought of a plan. I’ll just ride on your back and we’ll get there in no time!” \\n\\n \\n\\n But Friend Jack Rabbit scratched his head again. He wasn’t sure he could carry Doctor Rabbit, because the Doctor was very portly—that is, he was pretty fat and heavy. But anyway he agreed to try the plan. So Doctor Rabbit hurried into his house and put on his best pair of gold glasses and his best clothes. He always liked, he said, to look his best before his patients. Then with his medicine case in hand he sprang upon Jack Rabbit’s back. \\n\\n \\n\\n “See how fast you can run to the edge of the Big Green Woods. That will be a good test!” shouted Doctor Rabbit, and Jack Rabbit answered, “Very well. If you’re ready I’ll try!” \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2325/65023.html","bookId":591,"book":{"id":591,"title":"Doctor Rabbit and Ki-Yi Coyote","description":"简介： Doctor Rabbit lived in the very biggest tree in the Big Green Woods.
