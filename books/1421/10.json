{"id":20438,"no":10,"title":"CHAPTER X. THE SCARLET HOUSE OF SIN.","content":"The sinner stands with tearless eye And looks on virtue\u0027s lovely grace:— Too late, her soul\u0027s repentant cry The brand of sin is on her face At the very hour in the morning when Mrs. Sinclair and her servants were searching every nook and corner of the elegant residence, away over on the Surrey side of the great bridge, in a large brick house, standing far back from the street, two people, a man and a woman, were bending over a delicate form, clad in an evening dress of pure white satin that looked strangely out of place in this scarlet hued Harem of unchastity. The very hangings blushed in rose red symphonies for the sins and impurities of the inmates. The heavy carpet was one unbroken stain of blood red coloring. The daylight peered through the[Pg 66] rich window drapings and crimsoned the entire apartment with its guilty glances within. The exterior of the house was dull, dark and uninviting, but within, the glare of crimson, of dull red and deeper garnet, blended in every article of furniture and garnished walls, ceilings and windows in bewildering and feverish arrangement. Even the glasses on the small jasper table by the couch were red with the evil light of their intoxicating contents. The woman\u0027s dress was opened low at the throat and her jet black hair and clear olive skin were in sombre contrast to the clinging, reddish garment. That the man had carefully disguised both voice and raiment was plainly evident, but that he was no stranger to the house or its extraordinary mistress, was also a self evident fact. There were few who knew of this curious habitation, whose only furnishings were draperies and divans, small jasper tables and luxuriant couches, but the few who did were well content to contribute most generously for its maintenance, and more for the occupants of its numerous apartments, whose only glimpse of daylight was that which fell through the shamefaced windows and rested, like[Pg 67] the hands of a bashful lover, upon charms, half strange and half familiar to his touch. Julia Webber the mistress of this peculiar mansion, bent for a moment over the silent form, then she raised her eyes and looked with a strange, unseeing expression, into the wall beyond, as was her habit when addressing any one. The voice was low and distinct, but as cold and unsympathetic as steel, as she said with hardly a movement of the lips, \"Well what are your orders, Monsieur?\" The man at her side turned his eyes from the quiet face upon the couch and looked haughtily down upon her as he answered sharply, \"The same as usual. Why do you ask?\" For an instant he caught the gleam of fire through her half closed, panther like eyes as she gave him a searching side glance to note the effect of her brief question. \"You decline my offer, then,\" she asked, even more coldly, more distinctly than before. \"What do I want with you?\" the man exclaimed fiercely in excellent English. \"Have I not told you, Julia, that my brief infatuation ended the hour[Pg 68] that it began? Ah, she awakes!\" he exclaimed suddenly, and bent lower over the prostrate girl. Over Julia Webber\u0027s face there crept an ominous, ashen pallor. Her eyes blazed with the fury of a woman scorned, while her slender, jeweled fingers clutched the folds of her lurid garments with the grasp of a dying agony. Another moment and her emotions were controlled. The vindictive gleam in her eyes was unnoticed by the man, for at that moment his whole thought and attention was given to the white robed figure. Stella, for it was she, opened her eyes and looked around the unfamiliar room in utter bewilderment. Then her gaze rested upon the young man\u0027s face, but without a shadow of recognition in the face. With a smile of astonishing sweetness he bent gently over her and whispered softly, \"Do not be frightened, Stella. You are safe with me. Rest a little and I will explain all.\" Then, as her eyes closed once more in response to the powerful drug which he had administered, he turned roughly upon the woman at his side and bade her watch and wait upon this girl, then[Pg 69] adding with a significant expression, \"I make you responsible for her; I shall be back this evening;\" he abruptly left the house. When the door closed upon her companion, Julia Webber stood beside the couch, immovable as marble. Her flowing garments slipped from her sloping shoulders until one half her bosom was exposed. The lines of her face were rigid, but the swelling bosom rose and fell in gasps that were almost convulsive. Hatred, envy and revenge gleamed in her scintillating eye balls while she gazed upon the pure and beautiful features of Stella. At last, through her tightly closed teeth she muttered, hoarsely, \"So this is why he scorns me! For this girl of twenty. It is not her pretty face or perfect form in which lies her attraction for Monsieur, for I am equally beautiful, but it is her very virtue, her purity, that draws his passions like a powerful magnet and holds him her slave until the smirch of his own contamination is branded on her brow. Pah! These inconstant fiends; They mold us to their own ideals, then[Pg 70] scorn the creature of their own admiring handiwork. But enough of this! My revenge must be as sweet as my disappointment is bitter. I am mistress here, and perhaps my gallant Monsieur, some other more agreeable connoisseur may sip the dew from your budding rose before you again enhale its fragrance. \"Ah, Captain, you here,\" she exclaimed as a stranger unceremoniously entered the apartment. \"How could I remain from your presence, my beautiful Julia?\" responded the newcomer gallantly, then catching sight of the couch and its occupant he added, hastily, \"My God! how beautiful! who is she and where did you get her?\" \"Not so fast, Captain,\" said Julia, laughing quietly. Curiously enough the handsome Captain\u0027s evident admiration for Stella evoked no jealousy in her heart, but was a source of satisfaction on the contrary. Here was the opportunity for revenge on the man she loved, and she was not the woman to lose it, through any such foolish sentiment as that of jealousy. Revenge and love go hand in hand in[Pg 71] such natures as Julia Webber\u0027s. Her life had been one long succession of conquests, but to one man only had she offered constancy. Only those who are caught in the whirlpool of lascivious temptations can realize or appreciate the difficulty in fulfiling such a promise, but, Julia Webber, in spite of her evil life, was truer to a given word than many of her more righteous sisters. Her love had been accepted with alacrity, and spurned with contempt and loathing almost from the hour of consummation. Now, as this thought again flitted through her mind, she turned to the destingue individual by her side, and answered playfully, \"you know we tell no secrets here, Captain; she is here, and here to stay, that should be sufficient. She is slightly indisposed just now,\" she added, with a meaning smile, \"but if you wish to see her—\" \"I certainly do, Julia,\" and he also smiled significantly, as he eagerly awaited her reply. The woman hesitated a moment, and then, apparently changing the subject, said archly, \"By the way, Captain, there is a lovely crimson, velvet robe in Robinson\u0027s window—\" \"You shall have it to-morrow, and then?\" asked the Captain, anxiously— \"Ah, thank you, and, come in again to-morrow, Captain, I think I can arrange this little matter for you.\" Then she closed the door upon him, and again the panther-like gleam of her eye balls crept stealthily out between her half closed lids, but the smile that parted the thin red lips melted away in a heavy sigh, as she turned once more to look long and earnestly upon Stella\u0027s sleeping face.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2720/74769.html","bookId":1421,"book":{"id":1421,"title":"Death to the Inquisitive","description":"简介： A piercing shriek echoed throughout the entire length and breadth of the gloomy passage, hushed as it was in the brief hour of repose that usually intervened between the vice-rampant hour of midnight and the ever reluctant dawn....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2720","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:25:03 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:25:03 AM"}}
