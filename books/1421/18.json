{"id":20446,"no":18,"title":"CHAPTER XVIII. STELLA IS RESTORED TO HER LOVER.","content":"When love illumines all the day \\n\\n In which we changeful mortals live— \\n\\n How swift our rancors pass away— \\n\\n How doubly easy to forgive. \\n\\n \\n\\n During the brief moment that the sturdy English driver succeeded in holding back that span of frightened horses, Sir Frederic Atherton sprang from the carriage and by almost superhuman strength, drew from under the threatening hoofs, one of the prostrate women. \\n\\n \\n\\n A stalwart pedestrian ran to his assistance, but before the rescued woman could be placed out of harm\u0027s way, the other motionless form had been stamped upon and trodden into the earth by the infuriated brutes. \\n\\n \\n\\n As soon as they could be controlled, Sir Frederic and the unknown man raised the slender form, but one glance into her quiet face showed plainly that her life was ended, and that death, even in so horrible a manner, had brought her peace and rest. \\n\\n \\n\\n By this time, Lady Laura Trevor, Sir Frederic\u0027s sister, had alighted from the carriage, and learning the terrible circumstances, assisted her brother as best she could to place the two apparently lifeless forms within the carriage. \\n\\n \\n\\n Not until Sir Frederic had taken the delicate form of Stella into his arms, did he receive any intimation of her identity. But as he laid her head carefully upon his shoulder, an indescribable feeling of fear and trembling passed over his manly form. It seemed as if the pain, the horror, and even the unconsciousness of the helpless girl was shared, by him. Her misfortune, for the instant racked his nerves with agony, and subsiding, dulled his senses almost to complete oblivion, and it was only with a vague feeling of amazement that he heard his sister\u0027s sudden exclamation. \\n\\n \\n\\n The light of the carriage lamp had fallen on Stella\u0027s face, and although worn and pale from months of anxiety and imprisonment, it was readily recognized by Lady Trevor. \\n\\n \\n\\n Her voice sounded afar off in Sir Frederic\u0027s ears, but pulling himself together with a great effort, he looked eagerly down into the pallid face. For a moment happiness overcame him and he held her to his heart in a perfect ecstasy of joy and gratitude, but in another instant, fear for the result of her injuries, usurped the place of joy and leaning from the window he ordered his man to drive directly to the home of his sister, which was near at hand. \\n\\n \\n\\n The glow from the burning house reddened their way for some distance and fell with fitful glare upon the still, cold face that rested so heavily against Lady Trevor\u0027s arm. \\n\\n \\n\\n Never was the sterling sense and philosophy of Mrs. Sinclair\u0027s nature put to severer test than when Sir Frederic led her, some hours later, into Lady Trevor\u0027s magnificent parlors, and she beheld, stretched upon ready sofas, the lifeless form of Julia Webber, and the apparently lifeless form of her long lost darling, Stella. \\n\\n \\n\\n Controlling herself by a mighty will, Mrs. Sinclair watched and waited for the verdict of the famous physician, which should bring to her sorrowing heart renewed distress or unspeakable rejoicing. At last it came. Stella had raised her lustrous eyes to the physician\u0027s face, and then smiling faintly at Mrs. Sinclair, called her name, she nestled her hand in hers and fell back upon the pillow in a calm, recuperating sleep. \\n\\n \\n\\n Meanwhile the dead girl had been laid with tender care in an adjoining room. In removing her tasteful garments Mrs. Sinclair unfastened the silver girdle and examined the contents of the leather bag to find, if possible, some clue to her identity. \\n\\n \\n\\n The folded paper proved to be a memorandum of little consequence, but a brief statement of money deposited in a certain bank, gave them their only grain of information. This clue was acted upon at once, and both the body and the handwriting authentically identified thereby. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was further ascertained that in this same bank the sum of one hundred thousand pounds, had been placed by her, and here also was found a will, drawn up and signed in perfectly valid form, bequeathing her entire property, in case of sudden death, to a prominent home for fallen women in the city. \\n\\n \\n\\n With reverent hands they laid her in a velvet casket, and both Sir Frederic and Lady Trevor followed her to the tomb, while Mrs. Sinclair bent with joyful heart over the bedside of her cherished daughter. \\n\\n \\n\\n Nothing was known at the bank of the character of Julia Webber\u0027s business. \\n\\n \\n\\n The money had been deposited, little by little, for ten years, and left undisturbed until it reached a goodly figure, but during the ten years of her depositing they had never, in a single instance, cashed her check, and the eccentricity of their fair depositor, had caused much comment among the usually silent clerks. \\n\\n \\n\\n It remained for Stella to reveal the evil of this woman\u0027s life and the source of her illgotten revenue. But woman\u0027s fame can never suffer in the hands of the innocent: only from evil thoughts, come evil speech, and in Stella\u0027s loving heart none but the kindest thoughts were ever entertained, and the sad death of Julia Webber, erased from her mind the last dark shadow of suspicion, and kept her memory forever faithful. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2720/74777.html","bookId":1421,"book":{"id":1421,"title":"Death to the Inquisitive","description":"简介： A piercing shriek echoed throughout the entire length and breadth of the gloomy passage, hushed as it was in the brief hour of repose that usually intervened between the vice-rampant hour of midnight and the ever reluctant dawn....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2720","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:25:03 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:25:03 AM"}}
