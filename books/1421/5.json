{"id":20433,"no":5,"title":"CHAPTER V. MAURICE SINCLAIR.","content":"The storm that tears the human heart \\n\\n With deepest furrows, leaves its trace \\n\\n Like shadows from a passing cloud \\n\\n Upon the mirror of the face. \\n\\n \\n\\n Passing through Portland Place, at about the hour of eleven, on that damp, foggy night, it would have been impossible not to notice the most attractive of the many beautiful houses, for there emanated from its windows such a blaze of light that even the dense vapor that obscured all objects in its near vicinity was penetrated by the brilliancy for some distance. \\n\\n \\n\\n The carriages that stopped before its portals loomed up through the mist like phantoms, while the guests that entered the spacious door only lost their ghastliness as they emerged into the full glare of the inner hall during the brief moment of transit. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was very evident that a ball of more than ordinary magnificence was in progress, and one glance at the face of the hostess, Mrs. Archibald Sinclair, would have shown any intelligent observer that, to Mrs. Sinclair, at least, the necessity for making this particular entertainment a glorious success was so urgent that it destroyed, in a measure, her own enjoyment. Yet, with the innate tact of a woman born to receive, to entertain, and to genuinely please her guests, all trace of anxiety was carefully concealed, all nervousness overcome, and only affability and satisfaction were allowed reflection upon her expressive countenance. \\n\\n \\n\\n However, in spite of her complacent demeanor, there were few mothers present at that reception but could readily appreciate her feelings and who did not, in their inmost hearts, admire her diplomatic tact during so trying an ordeal. \\n\\n \\n\\n Not a few carefully modulated voices signified to each other their opinion and approval of her manner, for the gossips were out in full force that evening. They knew by long anticipation that food for their insatiable appetites would be furnished on this occasion in the person, manner and[Pg 35] language of Maurice Sinclair, their hostess\u0027 enigmatical son, who had so lately returned from the Great Desert of Gobi or some other equally undesirable quarter of the earth\u0027s surface. \\n\\n \\n\\n True, rumor had it that this eccentric young man had been seen in and about the City at intervals during the past year, but as any allusion made to the widow, his mother, on this subject, met with unapproachable silence, the matter was prudently dropped, and the information derived from newspapers and casual observers accepted or rejected according to the minds of the hearers, in the absence of better authority. \\n\\n \\n\\n Many of the matrons present this evening recalled, only too accurately, the days when Maurice Sinclair\u0027s boyish pranks refused for him admission to one school after another. His wrong doings were always of a nature too delicate for public mention and, after a more than usually disgraceful affair while he was only fifteen years of age, he suddenly vanished, and, but a month later, Archibald Sinclair, his disappointed father, was laid to rest in the family plot, leaving behind a sorrowing wife and a nearly heart-broken mother. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n At last, after five years had elapsed, Mrs. Sinclair, tired of the great house, and the wealth and splendor which she could never enjoy in solitude, adopted a distant relative, a beautiful girl of sixteen, and upon her she lavished the love of her true womanly heart and the wealth that flowed so abundantly into her coffers from many sources. \\n\\n \\n\\n Stella Ives, or Stella Sinclair as she was afterwards called, was one of those peculiarly beautiful women, combining that which is most rarely seen, beauty of face and form, with great depth of character and unusual mental precocity. Now, at the age of twenty-one, Stella stood peerless among her companions. Her wavy yellow hair fell low over a broad white forehead. Her hazel eyes shone with the clear light of a brilliant intellect. Her mouth was large, but shapely and sweet, and, in laughing, disclosed a set of faultless teeth that were at once the envy and admiration of all. Stella was a little above medium height, plump and graceful, and withal a girl whom all could admire, but whose natural reserve held aloof from her shrine the many lovers who would gladly pay their homage to so fair a divinity. \\n\\n \\n\\n Ten years had passed since Maurice disappeared and now, like one risen from the dead, he had returned and, in a brief but affectionate note, stated his intention to assist in entertaining her guests on this particular evening. He explained his non-appearance since reaching London as due to sensitiveness about meeting the mother whom he had so deeply grieved, but having heard of his adopted sister\u0027s \"coming out\" reception, he could control himself no longer and would throw himself humbly and unreservedly upon her mercy. \\n\\n \\n\\n Only an hour before the time for her guests to arrive Mrs. Sinclair called Stella to her luxurious dressing-room and, passing her arm around the young girl\u0027s form, said fondly: \"Stella dear, look your best to-night. You know we expect a large contingent of lords and baronets, and nothing fills my old heart with more exquisite pleasure than to witness the admiration which they bestow upon my beautiful daughter.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Stella laughed softly, but no blush of foolish vanity rose in her face at her foster-mother\u0027s tender words. She only pressed the matronly arm affectionately and replied, \"All right, mamma, I[Pg 38] will do my best. But you are sure it is because of the \u0027lords and baronets\u0027 that you wish me to look my best? Confess now,\" she continued archly, \"is it not because you wish the first glimpse of his adopted sister to be a satisfactory one to Maurice that you take this violent interest?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A little disconcerted by the young girl\u0027s reading of her secret, Mrs. Sinclair could only laugh and push her gently from the room. \\n\\n \\n\\n After Stella had gone, Mrs. Sinclair sank down on the sofa by the heavily draped window to hold brief communion with herself as was her wont when questions or thoughts of more than usual importance arose in her mind. There was only a few moments in which to thus commune, but Mrs. Sinclair possessed that distinctly feminine ability to evolve various extraordinary theories on a given subject and yet deduct therefrom a logical conclusion in about half the time it would take a less intuitive brain to lose itself completely in an inextricable tangle of reasons and vagaries. \"The past is past,\" was her conclusion. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My son will to-night be under my roof; I must begin at the beginning; there shall be no[Pg 39] reproaches. I shall offer him love, money, home, influence and a fair chance of winning a beautiful wife. If he refuses these, there is nothing more.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n So saying, she rose, and with a hopeful look in her eyes, passed, in her own stately and gracious manner, down the wide staircase and on into the spacious parlors of her beautiful home, now doubly attractive to her by the anticipated happiness of her son\u0027s return. \\n\\n \\n\\n For, although there was little doubt but that the erratic Maurice had been in London for many months, yet he had not seen fit to gladden his mother\u0027s heart with the sight of his almost forgotten face until just in time to give Stella\u0027s birthday reception a double significance. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2720/74764.html","bookId":1421,"book":{"id":1421,"title":"Death to the Inquisitive","description":"简介： A piercing shriek echoed throughout the entire length and breadth of the gloomy passage, hushed as it was in the brief hour of repose that usually intervened between the vice-rampant hour of midnight and the ever reluctant dawn....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2720","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:25:03 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:25:03 AM"}}
