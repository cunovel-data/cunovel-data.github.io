{"id":20457,"no":29,"title":"CHAPTER XXIX. THE HOME IN NEW YORK.","content":"\u0027Tis woman\u0027s best and sweetest claim To bear the honored name of Wife— But oh, how often is that name Her bitterest trial throughout life. It was evening, and the cosy parlor was bathed in rosy light, the curtains were drawn, and true to their old time customs Mrs. Sinclair and Stella were seated in easy chairs before a glowing fire. Stella did not sit at Mrs. Sinclair\u0027s feet as she did a few months ago; oh, no, now she sat in the matronly dignity of her months of wifehood in the rocker by Mrs. Sinclair\u0027s side, while her husband, quite forgetful of his newly acquired position, was well content to lie at her feet on the heavy rug and look admiringly up at her lovely face, while[Pg 182] little Elsa romped and tumbled about the room and turned things generally topsy-turvy in the exuberance of her spirits. Mrs. Morris, little Elsa\u0027s sweet faced mother, seldom sat with the family during these peaceful evenings, although both Stella and Mrs. Sinclair had frequently urged her to do so. She had insisted on performing the lighter duties of the house, and Mrs. Sinclair, appreciating her sensitiveness on the subject, persuaded Stella to allow her this as the surest means of keeping her beneath their care and influence. Not a question had been asked her regarding the past, as in Mrs. Sinclair\u0027s just opinions, the sin of inquisitiveness overbalances in nearly every instance the blessing of charity. With tears in her eyes she had requested them to call her Mrs. Morris, admitting that it was not her name, but before she could say more, Stella had placed her arm about her and whispered encouragingly, \"You need tell us nothing; trust in us as we shall in you, and try and feel happy in our home and I know there will be better days to come. I, too, have suffered, but you see how[Pg 183] radiantly happy I am now,\" and laughing from the very overflowing of her joyous heart, Stella kissed her tenderly and bade her speak no more on the subject. Dr. Seward\u0027s arrival surprised them greatly, and now, as they sat around the blazing fire they listened eagerly for the news which he hastened to relate. He told them of his visit to G—— St. and his examination of the powder, describing his feelings as nearly as possible while under the control of that peculiar drug; and now that Stella had so thoroughly overcome her horror of the subject, she also described her experience and corroborated the physician\u0027s vivid description in every particular. Not until he told them of Lawrence Maynard\u0027s secret marriage, did they relate in turn, the details of Maurice Sinclair\u0027s death as revealed to them by the story of the old Commander. The physician was completely overwhelmed for a moment at this seeming verification of his own suspicions. He had felt instinctively from the first that the man who so completely upset the Lady Van Tyne\u0027s composure on the evening of his first appearance, was not the son of Mrs. Archibald[Pg 184] Sinclair, yet now, in the presence of the unsuspecting woman, the bewildered Doctor was speechless and disturbed. At last he felt it necessary to continue the recital, and rallying his wits he congratulated them sincerely on their fortunate information and the proof that had so stubbornly denied all possibility of error. With sorrow for the misguided girl, they glanced curiously over the certificate and Stella, rising a moment later to adjust the shade, laid the paper carefully upon the nearest table. While they were still talking, the portieres dividing the double parlors were pulled gently aside and Mrs. Morris entered in search of the little one, as it was long after her usual hour for retiring. Stella immediately introduced them, but for a moment Dr. Stewart nearly forgot his manners in the piercing scrutiny of his glance. Somewhere he had seen that face before, or one resembling it closely, but ransack his memory as he would, he could not recall the circumstances. Turning quickly from the physician\u0027s searching gaze, Mrs. Morris said softly, \"come Elsa, come[Pg 185] to mamma; it is high time little girls were safely in bed!\" But Elsa was hiding beside Mrs. Sinclair\u0027s chair, and that good lady, with a face as demure as possible, was aiding the little culprit in her mischief by holding a fold of her gown about the tiny figure. Mrs. Morris saw the playful ruse and stepped across the room to pull the little one from her hiding place, but in doing so she had to pass the table and quite accidentally her glance fell upon the paper which Stella had just laid down. For a moment she stood and stared as if she could hardly believe her senses, then with a sudden bound, she seized the paper, crying, \"Oh, my certificate, my certificate! Where did you find it?\" It was several seconds before any one spoke. The little one crept from her hiding place and looked with wondering eyes upon her mother, while the woman, realizing that now all secrecy was over, turned pale and looked from one to the other with an expression of piteous pleading in her eyes. It was Mrs. Sinclair who was first to recover from the painful surprise. Rising hastily, she placed her arm about the trembling woman, saying[Pg 186] in tones of sympathy and tenderness,—\"My dear child, is it possible that you are Lawrence Maynard\u0027s wife?\" \"No, no,\" almost screamed the woman, as she shrank from Mrs. Sinclair\u0027s gentle touch. \"I was not his wife, but do pray believe me, I honestly thought I was!\" and she fell upon the floor, cowering at Mrs. Sinclair\u0027s feet in the humiliation of her shame. Not till her words of self immolation reached their ears, did any one present dream of the possibility of her ignorance regarding the validity of her marriage, but now Dr. Seward sprang to his feet and lifted her tenderly from the carpet to a sofa, while he explained as clearly as possible, the result of his investigations. \"My poor girl,\" he said gently, \"why are you so distressed? Is it possible that you have been deceived in this matter? You are indeed the lawful wife of Lawrence Maynard. I have proven the validity of that marriage by the clergyman himself. There is no reason why you should not look us all in the face, and with your help we shall soon be able to probe this matter to the bottom.\" For a few moments Elizabeth could hardly believe the welcome words. She looked eagerly from one to the other for confirmation of the blessed fact, then, as her eyes rested finally upon her baby\u0027s face, she fell upon her knees at Mrs. Sinclair\u0027s feet and sobbed for very happiness. As quietly as possible, Stella rose, and taking little Elsa in her arms, carried her gently from the room and out of the sound of her mother\u0027s hysterical weeping.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2720/74788.html","bookId":1421,"book":{"id":1421,"title":"Death to the Inquisitive","description":"简介： A piercing shriek echoed throughout the entire length and breadth of the gloomy passage, hushed as it was in the brief hour of repose that usually intervened between the vice-rampant hour of midnight and the ever reluctant dawn....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2720","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:25:03 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:25:03 AM"}}
