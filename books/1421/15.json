The two men recognized each other instantly, for Maurice, in his fancied security, had neglected the habitual disguise. Quick as flash he snatched the lines from his companion\u0027s hands and struck the spirited pony a sharp blow with the slender whip. Moments elapsed, however, before Sir Frederic could explain the situation to his friend and their stupid driver. Vehicles were constantly passing and when they were finally in readiness to pursue, the pony phaeton had vanished. The necessary papers were secured after much trouble and expense and a description of Maurice Sinclair, as he now appeared, furnished the Detective Bureau, but all to no purpose. Maurice had again evaded capture. The lady was readily found in one of the most fashionable homes on Fifth Avenue, but her information was limited. She denied that her companion was Maurice Sinclair, but that was of little consequence as it was more than probable he had adhered to the precaution of an assumed name, if nothing more. For fear of further publicity, the parents of the young lady removed her promptly from the city, and another two months passed while Chicago, St. Louis and even the Pacific slope were thoroughly searched for the missing man. At the end of that time Sir Frederic was forced to return to London by family matters and the search for his loved one was extended at every spare moment of his time. Meanwhile, Stella was still a prisoner in that quiet house with its scarlet furnishings. In the entire time of her confinement she had never passed the threshold of her door or seen the faces of the other inmates whose voices reached her so indistinctly through the heavy hangings. Julia Webber gave her every care and attention, but every entreaty for liberty was met with the same gentle but decided answer, \"Wait, Miss Sinclair,—You and I will leave this place together, but my house must be empty, first.\" Tired of questions that received no answers and prayers that were unavailing, Stella waited patiently and sadly for the hour of her release. At last it came. Julia Webber entered her room just at dusk one cold, foggy day and seating herself by her side, said seriously, \"Miss Sinclair, I shall take you home to-night. We are alone now and I can close the house forever. Do not be surprised at my change in costume when I leave this place for it will never do for you to be seen in public with such as I. Your honor has been saved, now you must let me guard appearances as well.\" Leaving Stella overcome with gratitude and happiness she left the room and going at once to her own boudoir, selected the poorest and plainest of her clothing and dressed herself modestly in a quiet grey gown, laying out at the same time another unassuming but far more costly robe for Stella\u0027s use. This she took to Stella\u0027s room. After Stella was dressed for her long anticipated journey, she waited quietly in the spacious parlor while Julia Webber passed, for the last time, through the apartments of this magnificent, but extraordinary abode. Everything was in perfect order. Opening a secret drawer in her dressing-case, she took therefrom a folded paper and thrust it carelessly into a small leather bag that was suspended from her waist by a delicate silver chain. Her money and jewels had been safely placed in the Bank some days before, and now she opened the wardrobe door and glanced curiously at the row of silken and velvet gowns, all costly and elaborately made, but each of some startling shade of lurid red. For a moment only, she hesitated, then she closed and locked the door, turning her back resolutely upon it while she muttered bitterly, \"I am done forever with that cursed color. What care I for man\u0027s homage, while my heart is breaking with the shame of unrequited love?\" Then, as her eyes roved restlessly about the rooms, old associations arose within her, and obeying a sudden impulse of her reckless nature, she again had recourse to the waxen matches. This time it was the heavy hangings that she touched with the blazing tapers, and when she felt confident that the deed was safely done, she closed the door behind her and returning to Stella with a curious smile upon her lips, led her hastily from the house without a backward glance. \"Let us walk a little,\" she said to Stella. \"It will do you good and we can take a hansom at the square,\" and so saying the two women walked rapidly along the foggy street while Stella\u0027s heart beat joyfully with this long desired accession to liberty and friends. They had only gone a few blocks when an engine dashed wildly past them, its bell clanging frightfully, while the cry of \"fire\" was echoed frantically from every side. Julia Webber smiled sadly and hurried on, almost dragging Stella in her haste to leave the excitement of whose origin she alone was cognizant, but[Pg 103] as they rushed thus heedlessly, across the slippery street, a span of powerful black horses, frenzied by the clanging bell, rushed upon them in the darkness, and before the sturdy driver could control their maddened fury, both women were lying prostrate beneath the heavy hoofs.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2720/74774.html","bookId":1421,"book":{"id":1421,"title":"Death to the Inquisitive","description":"简介： A piercing shriek echoed throughout the entire length and breadth of the gloomy passage, hushed as it was in the brief hour of repose that usually intervened between the vice-rampant hour of midnight and the ever reluctant dawn....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2720","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:25:03 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:25:03 AM"}}
