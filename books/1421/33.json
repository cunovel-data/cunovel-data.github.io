{"id":20461,"no":33,"title":"CHAPTER XXXIII. \"I HAVE NO NAME.\"","content":"What possession more awful that mortal can name Than the stigma of passion—the birthright of shame— The cloud of abasement grows deep and more dense Till the soul is deformed in its darkness, intense. It was only for a moment that Elizabeth crouched thus on the floor, for before Sir Frederic could reach her side she had staggered to her feet and confronting the trembling man with eyes grown suddenly haggard like his own, she exclaimed brokenly:— \"Oh, Lawrie! Lawrie! You won my love when my heart was innocent of sin; you deceived me and denied our marriage; you left your child to be born in dishonor and your lawful wife without protection,—but I will gladly forgive it all if you will only right the wrong that you have done[Pg 206] our little one by giving her, even at this late hour, her rightful name!\" Throughout her tearful, passionate appeal, the man she called her husband shrank back with lowered lids and hands upraised before his face as if to avert the torrent of reproaches that fell from her long silent lips; but now as she forgot her wrongs and only begged the rightful heritage of her child, the blood rushed violently to his face and rising, he bent unsteadily toward her as with blazing eyes and husky tones he exclaimed excitedly:— \"Name? My God! How can I give that which I never had?\" Then turning almost savagely to the wondering witnesses, he said bitterly, \"Coward and cur I may be, but that is my only legacy,—my only inheritance from the parents who brought me into a world of sin and left me, nameless and alone,—an outcast upon society and a leper among those who boast their proud morality.\" Then as his gaze rested once more upon his grief stricken wife, he lowered his tones to almost gentleness as he added: \"I saved your honor by[Pg 207] a legal marriage, but shame for the one honorable act of my life made me deny it:— \"I tried to kill you,\" he continued recklessly, but Elizabeth, realizing the awful consequences of the dreadful admission, sprang forward, crying sharply, \"No! No! Lawrie,—not that! Do not say that!\" but he thrust her wildly aside and went on as if no interruption had occurred: \"That was the second honorable impulse of my life. I knew the misery and shame of your surroundings was worse than death and as I had no name to offer you I tried to end your wretchedness\"— Before he could say more the hand of the law was upon him, and a stern but kindly intentioned voice, said briefly, \"Hush, man,—you are closing the door of a prison cell upon yourself by your talking; come, answer me and be brief,—are you or are you not Maurice Sinclair?\" \"I am not,\" was the husky answer. \"Are you or are you not, Lawrence Maynard?\" At this question Elizabeth leaned heavily forward on Mrs. Sinclair\u0027s arm, straining every nerve in her eagerness to catch his answer. [Pg 208] \"I am not,\" was again the faint reply. Then the officer turned to the excited group before him and with an attempt to shorten the trying scene, said curtly, \"Do any of you know this man, and if so, by what name do you know him?\" There was a moment\u0027s silence, then a stranger stepped forward from behind the others and almost simultaneously the two men looked into each other\u0027s eyes and exclaimed: \"Dr. Seward!\" \"Jack Fenton!\" Then the younger of the two, forgetful of his weaker frame, sprang angrily forward and grasping the physician\u0027s shoulder, hissed fiercely between his teeth, \"You called me Jack Fenton, but you know that name is false. You, and you only, can tell my father\u0027s name; speak, man, and clear the mystery of my birth, or by the God above—\" But the effort was too much for his feeble strength and he sank helplessly to the floor. Worn out by months and years of intense excitement and threatened danger; dependent upon the uncertain issues of chance and speculation for his maintenance[Pg 209] and haunted by a morbid thirst for the avenging of that shame and secrecy that dwelt upon his birth, it was little wonder that the shock of present circumstances benumbed his senses. When at last the room was cleared, Dr. Seward bent above the prostrate man and deep in his own heart the pain of a life\u0027s remorse sprang up and nearly overcame him. How much the young man knew of his part in the awful tragedy, he did not know, but deep in his own heart he felt that the responsibility of this wretched mortal\u0027s sins and miseries rested in great measure upon his shrinking shoulders, and satisfied now, beyond a doubt, that this was the child whose parentage he had so long concealed, he turned over and over in his mind the possibilities of yet undoing the wrong which he assisted, so materially, to do, thereby removing from his own accusing conscience the secret that so long had been its burden. But for Mrs. Sinclair\u0027s sake the words must yet remain unspoken. The prisoner would be speedily returned to London, and upon Lady Van Tyne he depended for aid in securing for her son, not only all that could possibly be done to make his trial speedy and his condemnation light, but the deathless silence which should save one noble woman from the knowledge of a loved one\u0027s treachery. Would Lady Van Tyne do this? Dr. Seward hardly knew, but he trusted that a mother\u0027s love would brave the scorn of public censure, and that human sympathy for a suffering sister would raise a shield of silence for the trusting wife\u0027s defence. The Lady Van Tyne was vain and worldly, still it was his only hope, and win or fail, it was for him to put it to the test. To Sir Frederic, only, he told his plans, then acting upon their mutual decision, he returned at once to England, leaving the unhappy young man safe in the custody of American law and justice.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2720/74792.html","bookId":1421,"book":{"id":1421,"title":"Death to the Inquisitive","description":"简介： A piercing shriek echoed throughout the entire length and breadth of the gloomy passage, hushed as it was in the brief hour of repose that usually intervened between the vice-rampant hour of midnight and the ever reluctant dawn....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2720","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:25:03 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:25:03 AM"}}
