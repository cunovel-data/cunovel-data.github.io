RESCUED BY THIEVES.","content":"And these are men,—these creatures bold, \n Who live to plunder and to kill; \n Formed in the Great Creator\u0027s mold \n But subject to the Devil\u0027s will. \n \n If all committers of this deed of questionable cowardice would choose so opportune a moment for their rashness as did Elizabeth, they would probably live to see the error of their ways and to realize that the things we know are better than the things we know not of, but it is rarely that one so determined as she to terminate a wretched existence is thwarted in that desire by the presence of rescuers, but such was the case in this instance. \n \n Two men of the type commonly known in London as wharf \"rats\" or dock and river thieves, were slowly sculling along under cover of the intense fog on the lookout for plunder of any and every sort. \n \n Naturally, when Elizabeth\u0027s body struck the water not ten feet from their craft, they stopped sculling and quickly investigated the nature of the prey that had so literally fallen into their hands. \n \n Elizabeth was pulled into the boat apparently lifeless, and in less time than it takes to chronicle the event, was shorn of her pretty rings, purse and outer garments. \n \n A folded paper pinned securely to the lining of her waist was also promptly removed by the thief and thrust carelessly into the outer pocket of his coat as he doubtless thought it of little consequence, and only confiscated it through a natural impulse of greed and robbery. \n \n Then the younger of the two proceeded to fasten a heavy lead around her waist, and lifting her carefully in his arms was about to lower the body once more into the silent river whose waters had already swallowed up and forever concealed innumerable secrets of like nature, when a flash from his partner\u0027s lantern falling upon Elizabeth\u0027s upturned face revealed to him her exceeding loveliness and awoke within him an instinct, whether brutal or humane, we shall shortly determine. \n \n [Pg 22] \n \n \"Oh, Oiy soiy, Bill, this \u0027ere lass is too bloomin\u0027 \u0027ansome tew feed de fishes wid,\" he said, \"and she ben\u0027t derd, nurther,\" he added, as he noticed Elizabeth\u0027s breath returning in short, faint gasps. \"Ben\u0027t hoften we picks hup such fine goods as dese,\" he continued, while a fiendish expression passed over his swarthy face. \"Blowed if Oiy doesn\u0027t think Oiy\u0027ll confiscate dis fer m\u0027 hown use,\" and he drew Elizabeth\u0027s still senseless form across his knee. \n \n \"Put\u0027er down, Jemmy! Cawn\u0027t you wait till you gets to de dock or does yer want ter stay hout \u0027n dis \u0027ere fog hall night?\" said the older man gruffly, adding authoritatively: \"Cover de gal hup in de bottom, she\u0027ll keep! Oiy\u0027m wet tew de\u0027 ide. Come, scull along hor we wont get \u0027ome till midnight.\" \n \n Whether it was the fragments of original humanity that made him refuse to witness the desecration of helplessness, or whether he possessed sufficient of the brute instinct to enjoy with keener relish the struggles of a frenzied woman in the hands of an unprincipled and determined villain, we can not tell;— \n \n [Pg 23] \n \n At any rate Elizabeth was allowed to lie quietly under an old sail in the bottom of the boat, returning slowly, but with such perfect control to acute consciousness that she allowed no sound of either fear or suffering to escape her lips. \n \n She overheard enough of their conversation, during the row down the river to show her who her rescuers were and what her ultimate fate would be unless she could escape from their clutches. She realized that even her unfortunate condition would give her no mercy in their hands and might rather be a source of more intense gratification to their fiendish and inhuman desires. Reason told her to remain perfectly passive, as it was evident they only awaited her return to consciousness for the furtherance of their diabolical plans. \n \n Even when the boat bumped heavily against the wharf, turned back and veered about in a most extraordinary manner and the damp fog of the river was exchanged for the foul stench of sewer gas and garbage floats, and she realized, with a feeling of horror, that they were gliding, not by, but under the dock, still she made no sound. \n \n At last they stopped by a rotten ladder; the[Pg 24] boat was tied and the younger man sprang hastily up the slippery steps and thrust open, with his shoulder, a heavy trap door. \n \n Then the older of the two raised Elizabeth from the boat and passed her up through the narrow opening to the man above. He then followed and after a hasty consultation between the two she was left, as the young \"rat\" expressed it, \"soif fer de present,\" on a pile of rags in the corner of the cellar. \n \n Then, apparently regardless whether she lived or died, they ascended another rickety ladder and the sullen gleam of their lantern was soon lost to sight in the darkness above. \n \n Elizabeth waited until the sound of their footsteps had passed away, then rising hastily, she began groping about in the darkness for the ladder which she had so dimly discerned by the light of the smoking lantern. \n \n Now every thing was dark, and the knowledge of that yawning trap-door and perhaps more just like it under her very feet, made her almost insane with fear. All desire for a watery death had vanished from her mind. Her lungs were so filled[Pg 25] with nauseous gases that it was with a feeling of almost frantic joy she touched the rungs of the worm-eaten ladder and prepared to climb to the landing above. \n \n The upper Hall was narrow, dirty and perfectly dark. Elizabeth groped her way carefully along, holding firmly to the wall, but could see no outlet or glimmer of light either before her or above, but knowing that to turn back would be but rushing to a fate far worse than death, she pressed eagerly forward, peering into the impenetrable darkness, while occasionally a great, slimy rat scampered across her foot, or a loathsome bat, with a sudden rush, passed so near her face that she turned sick with horror and held to the heavy walls with all her strength. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2720/74762.html","bookId":1421,"book":{"id":1421,"title":"Death to the Inquisitive","description":"简介： A piercing shriek echoed throughout the entire length and breadth of the gloomy passage, hushed as it was in the brief hour of repose that usually intervened between the vice-rampant hour of midnight and the ever reluctant dawn....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2720","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:25:03 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:25:03 AM"}}
