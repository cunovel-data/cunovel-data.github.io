{"id":20441,"no":13,"title":"CHAPTER XIII. THE CONTRACT BROKEN.","content":"The weapon tempts her—see—she feels its edge— Then breaks the contract—and returns the pledge. The man whom Julia Webber addressed by the French appellation, Monsieur, returned that evening, true to his word. He was received with smiles by the mistress of the house, who told him, in all sincerity, of Stella\u0027s still unconscious condition, and urged him to wait a little before presenting himself to the bewildered girl. Steeped in the ways of evil and deceit as he was, still he discovered no treachery in Julia Webber\u0027s words, and departed somewhat reluctantly, but in perfect faith as to his ultimate success. Julia Webber\u0027s desire for revenge was being fulfilled almost upon the hour of its conception. It was now nearly noon of the day following Stella\u0027s entrance to her house, and yet the fascination of her new guest\u0027s presence was still strong upon her. She had decided upon her course of action during that period of outward calm and inward perturbation, while she stood beside the sleeper\u0027s unconscious form. The silver clock in her private dressing-room was still tinkling the hour of noon when a maid entered and handed her a large parcel which had just arrived. \"Wait a moment, Jennie,\" her mistress said, and the extremely attractive maid, nothing loth to view the contents of the box, waited while the wrappings were removed and the magnificent robe of crimson velvet held admiringly to the light. \"Ask the young ladies to come in,\" was the next extraordinary command, and while she donned the exquisite garment, some seven or eight young women, strikingly beautiful in face and figure, filed noisily into the room, and threw themselves in graceful, negligent positions, upon the numerous couches and divans. The robe was beautiful, and fitted her [Pg 87]voluptuous form to perfection. After it had been duly admired and removed, the enthusiastic young women were horrified to see Julia Webber hold it from her at arms length while she lighted in succession a half dozen waxen matches and applied them in spots to the costly fabric. The velvet writhed and twisted, beneath the flame-like human flesh, whilst almost suffocating fumes pervaded every inch of the apartment. She held it thus in her hands, until it was completely ruined, leaving only enough uninjured, to show the original shape and beauty, then refolding it as best she could, she tied the wrappings again with her own hands and writing in large, clear letters across the package, \"The Pledge of a Broken Contract,\" ordered her maid to return it at once, to Captain Carlisle, Hotel Victoria. Then she dismissed the wondering women and went once more to the room that had become so strangely interesting. A moment later she stood beside the couch holding in her hand a cluster of delicious grapes, while Stella listened and ate with the expression of bewilderment gradually fading from her features. \"I wish you would tell me of yourself, freely[Pg 88] and unreservedly,\" Julia Webber said, and Stella, realizing at last some degree of truth regarding this woman and her surroundings, was clever enough to know that innocence and helplessness were by far the best weapons with which to fight her cause. In treachery and deceit, Stella was little versed, but as an intelligent and observing member of society, she knew only too well that they existed, and feeling altogether unequal to such a combat, she chose ignorance as the surest safeguard from further trouble. It was Julia Webber\u0027s request, that she would not ask to leave this particular apartment, that first opened her eyes to the nature of her surroundings. She shuddered involuntarily as the knowledge forced itself upon her, but she noted, sadly, that in spite of that promise, the key was softly turned on the outside whenever her hostess left the room. After a little thought, Stella concluded to tell her name, and the circumstances of her abduction as nearly as she could recall them, but it was only when she identified her abductor as Maurice [Pg 89]Sinclair, and mentioned her relations towards himself and his lovely mother, that Julia Webber\u0027s face in any way betrayed her interest in the narrative. \"You say that you reside in this Maurice Sinclair\u0027s home,\" she repeated, excitedly. \"Yes,\" Stella answered. \"And he will inherit great wealth, unless you stand between him and his mother\u0027s affection, I infer,\" she continued more quietly. \"Ah, I had not thought of that,\" exclaimed Stella suddenly. \"You must be right, that only could have been his motive for this awful deed. But I fear, so great is her love for me, that his plans will fail, unless I am safely restored to her.\" \"You shall return in safety,\" was the decided answer, while her listener\u0027s eyes blazed with the excitement of a new ambition. Here was her chance, and almost instantly her mode of action was decided. She had become sick and weary of her sinful life ever since that strange infatuation sprang up within her heart, and for one man\u0027s honest love, she would gladly have forsworn the admiration and homage of the world, but too late, she realized that man would never credit such as[Pg 90] she, with honest love, and the scorn her tender sentiments evoked, filled her whole soul with bitterness and longing for revenge. Now, through Stella\u0027s innocent and unsuspecting friendship, she felt the way was open for a more subtle and satisfying vengeance, and subduing her excitement with marvelous control, she continued seriously, \"Miss Sinclair, the subject of my life and surroundings is not one that I should broach to you, but you have given me your confidence in a measure, and, believe me, you shall never regret it. Now it may be a bold thing for me to do, but I am going to ask you a question, and upon your answer will depend much more than you imagine. Have I your permission?\" \"Certainly,\" was Stella\u0027s wondering reply. \"I wish to ask, Miss Sinclair, if I were to leave this place; abandon the life that I have led for ten years past and obey in future every regulation and restriction of respectable society, would you call me your friend and allow me to visit you at your home?\" For a moment only, Stella hesitated, then holding out her hand to this extraordinary woman, she[Pg 91] responded sincerely, \"forgive me for thinking of myself, but come with me from this terrible place and so long as your conscience can honestly claim my sisterly regard, it shall be yours.\" The tears trembled on her long, dark lashes as she raised her eyes to Julia\u0027s face, but at that instant a rap sounded on the outer door and without replying, her companion rose and passed swiftly out into the hall. The man whom she had known for several months only as \"Monsieur\" was standing in the wide, crimson draped hall, but the hangings were so thick that it was impossible to have overheard the conversation that had been carried on in low tones between the two. Placing her hand upon his arm, Julia Webber led him without a word into the spacious parlor which was also draped, even more luxuriously than the other apartments, in costly fabrics of vivid scarlet. Here she paused before him, looking into his eyes with orbs that blazed with anger, and through her tight drawn lips she fairly hissed the words, \"Maurice Sinclair, your adopted sister has told[Pg 92] me all. This is my house and beneath its roof you and she will never meet again.\" Then, while he stood apparently amused at this new freak of a peculiar woman, she moved to a dainty desk, and filling out a check for many thousand pounds, signed it, and once more stepping before him, thrust it into his hand, saying calmly, \"there is the amount which I have received from you. Now, go! and believe me, if you escape punishment at all other hands for your cowardly sins, the revenge of a woman\u0027s scorned devotion will at some time find you out.\" Then, before he could utter a word of protest or amazement, he was left alone in the fiery glow of the blood-red parlor. He looked mechanically at the paper in his hand, tore it in half, and dropping it upon the rug at his feet, turned like one in a trance, and slowly left the house.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2720/74772.html","bookId":1421,"book":{"id":1421,"title":"Death to the Inquisitive","description":"简介： A piercing shriek echoed throughout the entire length and breadth of the gloomy passage, hushed as it was in the brief hour of repose that usually intervened between the vice-rampant hour of midnight and the ever reluctant dawn....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2720","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:25:03 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:25:03 AM"}}
