{"id":20456,"no":28,"title":"CHAPTER XXVIII. TOO LATE.","content":"Too late—their sorrow now is o\u0027er— \\n\\n Their trusting hearts have ceased to beat; \\n\\n Beyond the clouds their spirits soar \\n\\n To Heaven\u0027s beautiful retreat. \\n\\n \\n\\n The clergyman was gray and bent with age, and it was some time before his feeble sight could discover a corresponding entry in his private memorandum book of marriages. At last he found it, and Dr. Seward stooped and read, in the old rector\u0027s handwriting, the brief statement of a marriage contract between one Lawrence Maynard and Elizabeth Louisa Merril, the date corresponding to the one on the wrinkled certificate. \\n\\n \\n\\n To make matters even surer, the two walked slowly across the street and entering the gloomy[Pg 177] doorway of a small, stone paved Chapel, passed on into the vestry and carefully examined the record of events occurring within its walls. \\n\\n \\n\\n Again their search was successful. \\n\\n \\n\\n Elizabeth Merril had been a lawful, wedded wife for nearly three years, and deep in thought as to what course it was best to pursue, Dr. Seward took leave of the venerable churchman and proceeded slowly on his way to the home of the aged couple in G—— St. \\n\\n \\n\\n He was as undecided how to act when he at last stood before the quiet house as he had been when he left the Chapel, but as he ascended the steps an exclamation of dismay escaped his lips. \\n\\n \\n\\n From the old fashioned brass knocker on the door there fell an ominous fold of black crepe, and before he could fairly recover from the shock of its appearance, the door was opened from the inside and a prominent lawyer of his acquaintance extended his hand and drew him into the narrow hall. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Just in time, Dr. Seward,\" said the lawyer in a subdued voice. \"I was about to send for you; Mrs. Merril has passed away and her husband is[Pg 178] fast following her. I have just drawn up his will and appointed you joint administrator with myself in the settlement of his small estate. He begged me to suggest some one and you were the first to enter my mind. Don\u0027t refuse, old fellow, for the man is dying and there is no time to look further if the matter is to be arranged before his death.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Confused, regarding his duty in the matter, Dr. Seward entered the chamber of death, but his practiced eye saw plainly that the information regarding Elizabeth came too late to be understood by the suffering man. \\n\\n \\n\\n The will was rapidly signed and sealed, and as if only waiting to complete this final act, the grey haired man turned feebly on his pillow and closing his eyes, passed painlessly from life to death, as had his devoted companion a few short hours before. \\n\\n \\n\\n The funeral service was ended, and with uncovered heads, both Dr. Seward and the friendly lawyer stood beside the new made graves in the little cemetery. \\n\\n \\n\\n Their duty to the dead was over, and now, as[Pg 179] arm in arm they retraced their steps to the silent house, Dr. Seward again related the particulars of Elizabeth Merril\u0027s disappearance and his subsequent discoveries, while the astute lawyer, bristling with legal eagerness, listened and drew silent conclusions from the physician\u0027s limited stock of information. \\n\\n \\n\\n The purport of the simple will was as follows:— \\n\\n \\n\\n The sum of five thousand pounds, together with the house in G—— St., with its furnishings, were to be kept in trust for their missing granddaughter, Elizabeth Merril, in case the reports of her death should prove unfounded, but if at the end of ten years no trace of her could be discovered, both house and money were subject to the wills and dispositions of the worthy lawyer and physician who were made joint administrators by this last will and testament of the deceased. \\n\\n \\n\\n Almost certain that Elizabeth Merril or Maynard still lived, the lawyer promptly undertook the difficult matter of finding and restoring her, as rightful heir, to the modest possessions of her lamented grandparents. \\n\\n \\n\\n Meanwhile, Dr. Seward, acting upon a much[Pg 180] desired plan, made prompt arrangements for an extended vacation, and great was the surprise in his mechanical household when he announced his intention of visiting America. \\n\\n \\n\\n He felt that Sir Frederic and Mrs. Sinclair should be consulted at once regarding the secret marriage, so placing the valuable paper in his steamer trunk, he boarded the fleetest greyhound and was soon far away upon his long anticipated journey across the Atlantic. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2720/74787.html","bookId":1421,"book":{"id":1421,"title":"Death to the Inquisitive","description":"简介： A piercing shriek echoed throughout the entire length and breadth of the gloomy passage, hushed as it was in the brief hour of repose that usually intervened between the vice-rampant hour of midnight and the ever reluctant dawn....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2720","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:25:03 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:25:03 AM"}}
