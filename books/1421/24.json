{"id":20452,"no":24,"title":"CHAPTER XXIV. STELLA CONFIDES IN HER HUSBAND.","content":"The sky is dark with storm and cloud— \\n\\n The ocean\u0027s face is cold and drear— \\n\\n But deep within two loving hearts \\n\\n The light of faith burns ever clear. \\n\\n \\n\\n The steamer was now about half way across the Atlantic, and this was the first disagreeable weather she had encountered. To-night the wind blew heavily; the waves rolled high and few of the many passengers remained on deck after the \"dog watch\" was set. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Sinclair felt a slight sensation of that much dreaded and truly awful malady which bears the mild, delusive name of sea-sickness, and remained quietly in her berth, but Stella, clinging to her husband\u0027s arm, reached a somewhat sheltered spot on deck, and there, with his arm about her, Sir[Pg 154] Frederic sat and looked about over the fast darkening ocean. \\n\\n \\n\\n Clouds, black and threatening, were rolling heavily across the sky, while the winds howled angrily through the rigging, and the white capped waves threw themselves against the steamer\u0027s sides as though enraged at her stubborn resistance of their destroying wills. Truly, sky and ocean, air and space, seemed joining powers in a mighty effort to overthrow the universe, and were only lashed into greater fury at the defiance cast in their very teeth by the handiwork of man. Yet the steamer advanced steadily forward, coquetting with the gentler waves and breasting the more determined ones with dogged persistence. \\n\\n \\n\\n But to Stella, the confusion of the elements brought only a feeling of greater security in her husband\u0027s love. She looked to him and trusted; she clung to him and was safe,—for come weal or woe, they were together, and death by whatever manner could bring no terror, so that it found her in his arms. After a few moments of silent contemplation, Stella raised her eyes and whispered softly, \"Dearest, there is something I would like[Pg 155] to tell you, in fact, I should have done so before but I was so happy I dreaded to revive old memories,—but now, I feel that I would like to tell you, of that night—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, Darling,\" Sir Frederic interrupted, quickly. \"Do not speak of it Stella. Try and forget all that is past, and live only in the joys of the present and future,\" and he pressed her closer to his side as if the joy of his present was sufficient to eradicate all memories of unpleasant nature. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But I think I would feel easier if I could tell you, dear,\" she pleaded. \"It was all so strange, but neither you or mamma ever asked me and some way I have never felt like mentioning it myself until to-night. Do let me tell you, Frederic,\" she entreated. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Stella, dear, if you wish to, certainly my love, only do not let your memory dwell upon so painful a subject.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is about that night,\" Stella said softly. \"I had gone to my room to retire, after telling Maurice plainly which room I was to occupy. I closed my door and threw open the window for a moment while I stood, injudiciously you will say,[Pg 156] and let the damp mists cool my face. I did not hear my door open, neither did I hear his step, but suddenly a most peculiar odor stifled me. I turned quickly to see from whence it came, and there was Maurice standing by my side. The expression on his face was horrible. I opened my lips, involuntarily, to scream, but no sound came. Instead, my throat and lungs seemed instantly filled to suffocating with the stifling odor. I grew dizzy and would have fallen but he caught me in his arms. Then he wrapped my cloak about me,—put my traveling cap on my head, and, Frederic, I walked out of the room with his aid, through the hall to the side door and actually entered a cab, knowing all the time exactly as well what I was doing as I know now, but it was impossible for me to speak or think connectedly. I could not move without his aid. So it was throughout that long and dreadful ride; I could neither speak or move but I heard and understood every word that he addressed to me. He evidently knew the exact nature of the drug that he had employed for he talked to me all the way, telling me his plans, and the awful fate that[Pg 157] awaited me if I did not yield to his wishes. But this I must say to his credit, that in no way did he molest me and I was as free from the pollution of his touch when I left the carriage as when I entered it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Here Stella\u0027s voice died away as a specially vindictive gust swept by their sheltered nook, and Sir Frederic, after pressing a tender kiss upon her lips, sprang to his feet and wrapping her closer in his ample rug, almost carried her across the deck and down to the comfortable stateroom, then leaving her with Mrs. Sinclair, he climbed the stairs once more, and walked back and forth across the slippery planks, trying to calm, if possible, the tumult of indignation and sorrow, that Stella\u0027s recital aroused within his breast. \\n\\n \\n\\n Soon two other passengers joined him in his solitary walk, and it was evident to him by the peculiar roll of the body, that one of the newcomers at least, was well accustomed to pacing slippery decks and encountering heavy seas. Sure enough, he was the old \"sea dog\" whose genial, brown face had won the hearts of all at the Captain\u0027s table. He was Commander of some ship now on dry dock, and was taking this opportunity to try a voyage with his friend, the Captain of the Cunarder. \\n\\n \\n\\n To-night, he had succeeded in enticing a particularly timid young man on deck to \"try the weather and brace him up a bit,\" as he good-naturedly explained it. But now that he was once more walking the deck in the teeth of a \"rattling breeze,\" \u0027his cup of pleasure overflowed and he proceeded to terrify the young man nearly out of his wits by a thrilling sea yarn of earlier days. \\n\\n \\n\\n Sir Frederic, realizing that a story told on deck is common property, linked his arm in the young man\u0027s unoccupied one and catching step as best he could, walked on, while he listened somewhat absently to the Captain\u0027s narrative. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2720/74783.html","bookId":1421,"book":{"id":1421,"title":"Death to the Inquisitive","description":"简介： A piercing shriek echoed throughout the entire length and breadth of the gloomy passage, hushed as it was in the brief hour of repose that usually intervened between the vice-rampant hour of midnight and the ever reluctant dawn....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2720","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:25:03 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:25:03 AM"}}
