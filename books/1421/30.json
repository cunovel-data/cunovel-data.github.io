{"id":20458,"no":30,"title":"CHAPTER XXX. SAM LEE DISCOVERS A FARO GAME.","content":"A hard thing it is to recall to another \n The seeds of wrong doing our brother has sown \n But harder it is, our proud spirits to smother \n And confess to a harvest so largely our own. \n \n It was long past midnight before the ladies thought of retiring, so great was the excitement consequent upon the evening\u0027s revelations. But at last the Doctor and Sir Frederic were left alone. The fire was growing dim, but neither of the gentlemen thought to have it replenished. The physician\u0027s mind was so intent upon the identity of Lawrence Maynard that it seemed at last to react with unconscious cerebration upon the thoughts of Sir Frederic, for he paced the room thoughtfully a few moments, then pausing directly[Pg 189] before his companion, said anxiously, \"Dr. Seward, have you any theory whatever regarding this man,—this imposter?\" \n \n Like one confronted by the utterance of his own private thoughts Dr. Seward started and was for a moment embarrassed, but controlling himself, he said briefly, \"Yes, Sir Frederic, I have a theory, but it is so vague and so intensely disagreeable that I dread to give it utterance.\" \n \n Then, as Sir Frederic turned away without further questioning, he too, rose excitedly and began pacing the floor. \n \n \"Sir Frederic I will tell you my suspicion,\" he said suddenly, after a short silence. \"It may be but a foolish fancy, yet I cannot shake it off.\" Then he told him fully, but with deep remorse, of the episode in his early life in which the Lady Van Tyne figured so conspicuously, but with the determination to shield his patient to the last, he told the entire story without mentioning a name, still to make his theory well founded, he was obliged to state that the two boys were as alike as brothers, and Sir Frederic, with a sinking heart, gave a shrewd guess as to the children\u0027s parentage. \n \n [Pg 190] \n \n He was only a few years younger than the Lady Van Tyne and he now recalled many instances of her imprudent demeanor when a girl, but the reflection cast upon Archibald Sinclair\u0027s morality by the Doctor\u0027s story, was a source of deep regret when he thought of the patient, still worshiping, wife. \n \n In another moment his mode of action was decided, and placing his hand upon Dr. Seward\u0027s shoulder, he said sadly, \"Doctor, I will respect your story as I have no doubt as to the truth of the facts you have stated, but unless this matter can be handled without one word of her husband\u0027s treachery coming to Mrs. Sinclair\u0027s ears, I shall quietly withdraw from the search and allow that masquerading rascal to go \u0027scot free,\u0027 so far as I am personally concerned.\" \n \n \"And I will gladly close my lips,\" answered Dr. Seward, \"if you so advise, but find him, we must, for it is more than possible that my suspicions are unfounded and I can never rest until the matter is settled.\" \n \n Sir Frederic had no time to reply, for after a hurried rap upon the door, the portly butler, red[Pg 191] with excitement, entered, and beckoning Sir Frederic aside, said apologetically: \n \n \"There\u0027s a Chinaman down at the basement door that says \u0027e must see you hat once, Sir! I hordered \u0027im away, but \u0027twas no use. \u0027E says \u0027e\u0027s bound and determined to see you!\" \n \n Sir Frederic had not seen Sam Lee since the day of his arrival in the city, but he recalled him instantly, and feeling sure that his was an errand of importance, he dismissed the indignant butler and listened with great eagerness for what the Mongolian had to say. \n \n Sam Lee had improved his time while in New York and could now communicate quite fluently in his funny, broken English, but now, in the intensity of his emotions, his newly acquired learning forsook him and for at least five minutes he poured forth a succession of abbreviated words and sentences that were positively maddening to a man so seriously interested as was Sir Frederic. \n \n But at last he seemed to comprehend the situation, and ceasing his voluble chatter, repeated, over and over again the words, \"Me find him![Pg 192] Me find him! Melican man come klick,—Chinaman show way!\" \n \n Sir Frederic, sure that the words were true, motioned for Sam Lee to wait and then ran back to the parlor where he hurriedly explained the news to the physician and requested him to act his pleasure about accompanying him on so disagreeable an errand. \n \n Dr. Seward was eager to go, and in a few seconds both men were ready for the street. \n \n Thinking Stella might be alarmed at his protracted absence, Sir Frederic mounted the stairs and turned the latch of her sleeping room as softly as possible. \n \n The light was burning dimly, and as he surmised, his wife was far in the land of dreams. Her fair hair fell upon the pillow, while the coverlid, slipping from her shoulders, exposed her tender loveliness, and almost with tears in his eyes, Sir Frederic bent and touched his lips to a wandering curl while he covered the dimpled shoulders, and then with another look at the beautiful, childish face, turned and passed noiselessly from the room. The thought that his fair and innocent darling[Pg 193] had once been held within the power of this unprincipled villain, sent his blood tingling through his veins, and with a sudden thirst for vengeance in his soul, he quickly rejoined the others, and following closely upon the heels of the excited Chinaman, was, an hour later, in the actual presence of the man who for nearly three years had succeeded in evading justice and escaping the penalty of his guilty deeds. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2720/74789.html","bookId":1421,"book":{"id":1421,"title":"Death to the Inquisitive","description":"简介： A piercing shriek echoed throughout the entire length and breadth of the gloomy passage, hushed as it was in the brief hour of repose that usually intervened between the vice-rampant hour of midnight and the ever reluctant dawn....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2720","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:25:03 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:25:03 AM"}}
