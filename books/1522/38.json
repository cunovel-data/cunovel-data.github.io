{"id":62628,"no":38,"title":"Page 38","content":"Ordinarily, after midnight, pressures in air traffic control relented slightly. Tonight they hadn\u0027t. Because of the storm, airlines at Lincoln International were continuing to dispatch and receive flights which were hours late. More often than not, their lateness was added to by the general runway and taxiway congestion still prevailing. Most members of the earlier eight-hour watch in air traffic control had ended their shift at midnight and gone wearily home. Newcomers on duty had taken their place. A few controllers, because of staff shortage and illness of others, had been assigned a spread-over shift which would end at 2 A.M. They included the tower watch chief; Wayne Tevis, the radar supervisor; and Keith Bakersfeld. Since the emotion-charged session with his brother, which ended abruptly and abortively an hour and a half ago, Keith had sought relief of mind by concentrating intensely on the radar screen in front of him. If he could maintain his concentration, he thought, the remaining time---the last he would ever have to fill---would pass quickly. Keith had continued handling east arrivals, working with a young assistant---a radar handoff man---seated on his left. Wayne Tevis was still supervising, riding his castor-equipped stool around the control room, propelled by his Texan boots, though less energetically, as Tevis\u0027s own duty shift neared an end. In one sense, Keith had succeeded in his concentration; yet in a strange way he bad not. It seemed almost as if his mind had split into two levels, like a duplex, and he was able to be in both at once. On one level he was directing east arrivals traffic---at the moment, without problems. On the other, his thoughts were personal and introspective. It was not a condition which could last, but perhaps, Keith thought, his mind was like a light bulb about to fail and, for its last few minutes, burning brightest. The personal side of his thoughts was dispassionate now, and calmer than before; perhaps the session with Mel had achieved that, if nothing more. All things seemed ordained and settled. Keith\u0027s duty shift would end; he would leave this place; soon after, all waiting and all anguish would be over. He had the conviction that his own life and others\u0027 were already severed; he no longer belonged to Natalie or Mel, or Brian and Theo... or they to him. He belonged to the already dead---to the Redfems who had died together in the wreck of their Beech Bonanza; to little Valerie... her family. That was it! Why had he never thought of it that way before; realized that his own death was a debt he owed the Redferns? With continued dispassion, Keith wondered if he were insane; people who chose suicide were said to be, but either way it made no difference. His choice was between torment and peace; and before the light of morning, peace would come. Once more, as it had intermittently in the past few hours, his hand went into his pocket, fingering the key to room 224 of the O\u0027Hagan Inn. All the while, on the other mental level, and with traces of his old flair, he coped with east arrivals. Awareness of the crisis with Trans America Flight Two came to Keith gradually. Lincoln air traffic control had been advised of Flight Two\u0027s intention to return there---almost an hour ago, and seconds after Captain Anson Harris\u0027s decision was made known. Word had come by \"hot line\" telephone directly from Chicago Center supervisor to the tower watch chief, after similar notification through Cleveland and Toronto centers. Initially there had been little to do at Lincoln beyond advising the airport management, through the Snow Desk, of the flight\u0027s request for runway three zero. Later, when Flight Two had been taken over from Cleveland, by Chicago Center, more specific preparations were begun. Wayne Tevis, the radar supervisor, was alerted by the tower chief, who went personally to the radar room to inform Tevis of Flight Two\u0027s condition, its estimated arrival time, and the doubt about which runway---two five or three zero---was to be used for landing. At the same time, ground control was notifying airport emergency services to stand by and, shortly after, to move with their vehicles onto the airfield. A ground controller talked by radio telephone with Joe Patroni to check that Patroni had been advised of the urgent need for runway three zero. He had. Contact was then established, on a reserve radio frequency, between the control tower and the flight deck of the Aereo-Mexican jet which blocked the runway. The setup was to ensure that when Patroni was at the aircraft\u0027s controls, there could be instant two-way communication, if needed. In the radar room, when he had listened to the tower chief\u0027s news, Wayne Tevis\u0027s initial reaction was to glance at Keith. Unless duties were changed around, it would be Keith, in charge of east arrivals, who would accept Flight Two from Chicago Center, and monitor the flight in. Tevis asked the tower chief quietly, \"Should we take Keith off; put someone else on?\" The older man hesitated. He remembered the earlier emergency tonight involving the Air Force KC-135. He had removed Keith from duty then, on a pretext, and afterward wondered if he had been too hasty. When a man was teeter-tottering between self-assurance and the loss of it, it was easy to send the scales the wrong way without intending to. The tower chief had an uneasy feeling, too, of having blundered into something private between Keith and Mel Bakersfeld when the two of them were talking earlier in the corridor outside. He could have left them alone for a few minutes longer, but hadn\u0027t. The tower watch chief was tired himself, not only from the trying shift tonight, but from others which preceded it. He remembered reading somewhere recently that new air traffic systems, being readied for the mid-1970s, would halve controllers\u0027 work loads, thereby reducing occupational fatigue and nervous breakdowns. The tower chief remained skeptical. He doubted if, in air traffic control, pressures would ever lighten; if they eased in one way, he thought, they would increase in another. It made him sympathize with those who, like Keith---still gaunt, pate, strained---had proved victims of the system. Still in an undertone, Wayne Tevis repeated, \"Do I take him off, or not?\" The tower chief shook his head. Low-voiced, he answered, \"Let\u0027s not push it. Keep Keith on, but stay close.\" It was then that Keith, observing the two with heads together, guessed that something critical was coming up. He was, after all, an old hand, familiar with signals of impending trouble. Instinct told him, too, that the supervisors\u0027 conversation was in part, about himself. He could understand why. Keith had no doubt he would be relieved from duty in a few minutes from now, or shifted to a less vital radar position. He found himself not caring. It was a surprise when Tevis---without shuffling duties---began warning all watch positions of the expected arrival of Trans America Two, in distress, and its priority handling. Departure control was cautioned: Route all departures well clear of the flight\u0027s anticipated route in. To Keith, Tevis expounded the runway problem---the uncertainty as to which runway was to be used, and the need to postpone a decision until the last possible moment. \"You work out your own plan, buddy boy,\" Tevis instructed in his nasal Texas drawl. \"And after the handover, stay with it. We\u0027ll take everything else off your hands.\" At first, Keith nodded agreement, no more perturbed than he had been before. Automatically, he began to calculate the flight pattern he would use. Such plans were always worked out mentally. There was never time to commit them to paper; besides, the need for improvisation usually turned up. As soon as he received the flight from Chicago Center, Keith reasoned, he would head it generally toward runway three zero, but with sufficient leeway to swing the aircraft left---though without drastic turns at low altitude---if runway two five was forced on them as the final choice. He calculated: He would have the aircraft under approach control for approximately ten minutes. Tevis had already advised him that not until the last five, probably, would they know for sure about the runway. It was slicing things fine, and there would be sweating in the radar room, as well as in the air. But it could be managed---just. Once more, in his mind, Keith went over the planned flight path and compass headings. By then, more definite reports had begun to filter, unofficially, through the tower. Controllers passed information to each other as work gaps permitted... The flight had had a mid-air explosion. It was limping in with structural damage and injured people... Control of the airplane was in doubt. The pilots needed the longest runway---which might or might not be available... Captain Demerest\u0027s warning was repeated: ...on two five a broken airplane and dead people... The captain had sent a savage message to the airport manager. Now, the manager was out on three zero, trying to get the runway cleared... The time available was shortening. Even among the controllers, to whom tension was as commonplace as traffic, there was now a shared nervous anxiety. Keith\u0027s radar handoff man, seated alongside, passed on the news which came to him in snatches. As he did, Keith\u0027s awareness and apprehension grew. He didn\u0027t want this, or any part of it! There was nothing he sought to prove, or could; nothing he might retrieve, even if he handled the situation well. And if he didn\u0027t, if he mishandled it, he might send a planeload of people to their deaths,as he had done once before already. Across the radar room, on a direct line, Wayne Tevis took a telephone call from the tower watch chief. A few minutes ago the chief had gone one floor above, into the tower cab, to remain beside the ground controller. Hanging up, Tevis propelled his chair alongside Keith. \"The old man just had word from center. Trans America Two---three minutes from handoff.\" The supervisor moved on to departure control, checking that outward traffic was being routed clear of the approaching flight. The man on Keith\u0027s left reported that out on the airfield they were still trying frantically to shift the stranded jet blocking runway three zero. They had the engines running, but the airplane wouldn\u0027t move. Keith\u0027s brother (tbe handoff man said) had taken charge, and if the airplane wouldn\u0027t move on its own, was going to smash it to pieces to clear the runway. But everybody was asking: was there time? If Mel thought so, Keith reasoned, there probably was. Mel coped, he managed things; he always had. Keith couldn\u0027t cope---at least not always, and never in the same way as Mel. It was the difference between them. Almost two minutes had gone by. Alongside Keith, the handoff man said quietly, \"They\u0027re coming on the scope.\" On the edge of the radarscope Keith could see the double blossom radar distress signal---unmistakably Trans America Two. Keith wanted out! He couldn\u0027t do it! Someone else must take over; Wayne Tevis could himself. There was still time. Keith swung away from the scope looking for Tevis. The supervisor was at departure control, his back toward Keith. Keith opened his mouth to call. To his horror, no words came. He tried again... the same. He realized: It was as in the dream, his nightmare; his voice had failed him... But this was no dream; this was reality! Wasn\u0027t it?... Still struggling to articulate, panic gripped him. On a panel above the scope, a flashing white light indicated that Chicago Center was calling. The handoff man picked up a direct line phone and instructed, \"Go ahead, center.\" He turned a selector, cutting in a speaker overhead so that Keith could hear. \"Lincoln, Trans America Two is thirty miles southeast of the airport. He\u0027s on a heading of two five zero.\" \"Roger, center. We have him in radar contact. Change him to our frequency.\" The handoff man replaced the phone. Center, they knew, would now be instructing the flight to change radio frequency, and probably wishing them good luck. It usually happened that way when an aircraft was in trouble; it seemed the least that anyone could do from the secure comfort of the ground. In this isolated, comfortably warm room of low-key sounds, it was difficult to accept that somewhere outside, high in the night and darkness, buffeted by wind and storm, its survival in doubt, a crippled airliner was battling home. The east arrivals radio frequency came alive. A harsh voice, unmistakably Vernon Demerest\u0027s; Keith hadn\u0027t thought about that until this moment. \"Lincoln approach control, this is Trans America Two, maintaining six thousand feet, heading two five zero.\" The handoff man was waiting expectantly. It was Keith\u0027s moment to acknowledge, to take over. But he wanted out! Wayne Tevis was still turned away! Keith\u0027s speech wouldn\u0027t come. \"Lincoln approach control,\" the voice from Trans America Two grated again, \"where in hell are you?\" Where in hell... Why wouldn\u0027t Tevis turn? Keith seethed with sudden rage. Damn Tevis! Damn air traffic control! Damn his dead father, Wild Blue Bakersfeld, who led his sons into a vocation Keith hadn\u0027t wanted to begin with! Damn Mel, with his infuriating self-sufficient competence! Damn here and now! Damn everything!... The handoff man was looking at Keith curiously. At any moment Trans America Two would call again. Keith knew that he was trapped. Wondering if his voice would work, he keyed his mike. \"Trans America Two,\" Keith said, \"this is Lincoln approach control. Sorry about the delay. We\u0027re still hoping for runway three zero; we shall know in three to five minutes.\" A growled acknowledgment, \"Roger, Lincoln. Keep us informed.\" Keith was concentrating now; the extra level of his mind had closed. He forgot Tevis, his father, Mel, himself. All else was excluded but the problem of Flight Two. He radioed clearly and quietly, \"Trans America Two, you are now twenty-five miles east of the outer marker. Begin descent at your discretion. Start a right turn to heading two six zero...\" ONE FLOOR above Keith, in the glass-walled tower cab, the ground controller had advised Mel Bakersfeld that handoff from Chicago Center had occurred. Mel radioed back, \"Snowplows and graders have been ordered to move, and clear the Aereo-Mexican aircraft from the runway. Instruct Patroni to shut down all engines immediately. Tell him---if he can, get clear himself; if not, hold on tight. Stand by for advice when runway is clear.\" On a second frequency, the tower chief was already informing Joe Patroni.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/airport/page-38.html","bookId":1522,"book":{"id":1522,"title":"Airport","description":"Storyline: The story takes place mainly over the course of one evening and night, as a massive snowstorm plays havoc with airport operations. The storyline centers on Bakersfeld\u0027s struggles to keep the airport open during the storm. His chief problem is the unexpected closure of primary Runway three zero, caused when a landing airliner turns off past the wrong side of a runway marker light, burying the plane\u0027s landing gear in the snow, and blocking the runway. This becomes a major problem as another airplane, Trans America Flight Two, experiences an midair emergency and returns to Lincoln. This requires that the runway become quickly available. The runway numbers in the novel differed from those in the later movie, as did numerous other details. The closing of runway three zero requires the use of shorter runway 25, which has the unfortunate consequence of causing planes to take off over a noise-sensitive suburb, whose residents picket the airport in protest.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/airport.jpg","author":"Arthur Hailey","type":"Adventure","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/airport.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:40 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:43:47 AM"}}
