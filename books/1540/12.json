{"id":106443,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"Strider\\n\\n Frodo, Pippin, and Sam made their way back to the parlour. There was no light. Merry was not there, and the fire had burned low. It was not until they had puffed up the embers into a blaze and thrown on a couple of faggots that they discovered Strider had come with them. There he was calmly sitting in a chair by the door!\\n\\n \u0027Hallo!\u0027 said Pippin. \u0027Who are you, and what do you want?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I am called Strider,\u0027 he answered: \u0027and though he may have forgotten it, your friend promised to have a quiet talk with me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You said I might hear something to my advantage, I believe,\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027What have you to say?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Several things,\u0027 answered Strider. \u0027But, of course, I have my price.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What do you mean?\u0027 asked Frodo sharply.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t be alarmed! I mean just this: I will tell you what I know, and give you some good advice �C but I shall want a reward.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And what will that be, pray?\u0027 said Frodo. He suspected now that he had fallen in with a rascal, and he thought uncomfortably that he had brought only a little money with him. All of it would hardly satisfy a rogue, and he could not spare any of it.\\n\\n \u0027No more than you can afford,\u0027 answered Strider with a slow smile, as if he guessed Frodo\u0027s thoughts. \u0027Just this: you must take me along with you, until I wish to leave you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, indeed!\u0027 replied Frodo, surprised, but not much relieved. \u0027Even if I wanted another companion, I should not agree to any such thing, until I knew a good deal more about you, and your business.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Excellent!\u0027 exclaimed Strider, crossing his legs and sitting back comfortably. \u0027You seem to be coming to your senses again, and that is all to the good. You have been much too careless so far. Very well! I will tell you what I know, and leave the reward to you. You may be glad to grant it, when you have heard me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Go on then!\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027What do you know?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Too much; too many dark things,\u0027 said Strider grimly. \u0027But as for your business -\u0027 He got up and went to the door, opened it quickly and looked out. Then he shut it quietly and sat down again. \u0027I have quick ears,\u0027 he went on, lowering his voice, \u0027and though I cannot disappear, I have hunted many wild and wary things and I can usually avoid being seen, if I wish. Now, I was behind the hedge this evening on the Road west of Bree, when four hobbits came out of the Downlands. I need not repeat all that they said to old Bombadil or to one another, but one thing interested me. Please remember, said one of them, that the name Baggins must not be mentioned. I am Mr. Underhill, if any name must be given. That interested me so much that I followed them here. I slipped over the gate just behind them. Maybe Mr. Baggins has an honest reason for leaving his name behind; but if so, I should advise him and his friends to be more careful.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t see what interest my name has for any one in Bree,\u0027 said Frodo angrily, \u0027and I have still to learn why it interests you. Mr. Strider may have an honest reason for spying and eavesdropping; but if so, I should advise him to explain it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well answered!\u0027 said Strider laughing. \u0027But the explanation is simple: I was looking for a Hobbit called Frodo Baggins. I wanted to find him quickly. I had learned that he was carrying out of the Shire, well, a secret that concerned me and my friends.\\n\\n \u0027Now, don\u0027t mistake me!\u0027 he cried, as Frodo rose from his seat, and Sam jumped up with a scowl. \u0027I shall take more care of the secret than you do. And care is needed!\u0027 He leaned forward and looked at them. \u0027Watch every shadow!\u0027 he said in a low voice. \u0027Black horsemen have passed through Bree. On Monday one came down the Greenway, they say; and another appeared later, coming up the Greenway from the south.\u0027\\n\\n There was a silence. At last Frodo spoke to Pippin and Sam: \u0027I ought to have guessed it from the way the gatekeeper greeted us,\u0027 he said. \u0027And the landlord seems to have heard something. Why did he press us to join the company? And why on earth did we behave so foolishly: we ought to have stayed quiet in here.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It would have been better,\u0027 said Strider. \u0027I would have stopped your going into the common-room, if I could; but the innkeeper would not let me in to see you, or take a message.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Do you think he�C\u0027 began Frodo.\\n\\n \u0027No, I don\u0027t think any harm of old Butterbur. Only he does not altogether like mysterious vagabonds of my sort.\u0027 Frodo gave him a puzzled look. \u0027Well, I have rather a rascally look, have I not?\u0027 said Strider with a curl of his lip and a queer gleam in his eye. \u0027But I hope we shall get to know one another better. When we do, I hope you will explain what happened at the end of your song. For that little prank�C\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It was sheer accident!\u0027 interrupted Frodo.\\n\\n \u0027I wonder,\u0027 said Strider. \u0027Accident, then. That accident has made your position dangerous.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hardly more than it was already,\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027I knew these horsemen were pursuing me; but now at any rate they seem to have missed me and to have gone away.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You must not count on that!\u0027 said Strider sharply. \u0027They will return. And more are coming. There are others. I know their number. I know these Riders.\u0027 He paused, and his eyes were cold and hard. \u0027And there are some folk in Bree who are not to be trusted,\u0027 he went on. \u0027Bill Ferny, for instance. He has an evil name in the Bree-land, and queer folk call at his house. You must have noticed him among the company: a swarthy sneering fellow. He was very close with one of the Southern strangers, and they slipped out together just after your \"accident\". Not all of those Southerners mean well; and as for Ferny, he would sell anything to anybody; or make mischief for amusement.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What will Ferny sell, and what has my accident got to do with him?\u0027 said Frodo, still determined not to understand Strider\u0027s hints.\\n\\n \u0027News of you, of course,\u0027 answered Strider. \u0027An account of your performance would be very interesting to certain people. After that they would hardly need to be told your real name. It seems to me only too likely that they will hear of it before this night is over. Is that enough? You can do as you like about my reward: take me as a guide or not. But I may say that I know all the lands between the Shire and the Misty Mountains, for I have wandered over them for many years. I am older than I look. I might prove useful. You will have to leave the open road after tonight; for the horsemen will watch it night and day. You may escape from Bree, and be allowed to go forward while the Sun is up; but you won\u0027t go far. They will come on you in the wild, in some dark place where there is no help. Do you wish them to find you? They are terrible!\u0027\\n\\n The hobbits looked at him, and saw with surprise that his face was drawn as if with pain, and his hands clenched the arms of his chair. The room was very quiet and still, and the light seemed to have grown dim. For a while he sat with unseeing eyes as if walking in distant memory or listening to sounds in the Night far away.\\n\\n \u0027There!\u0027 he cried after a moment, drawing his hand across his brow. \u0027Perhaps I know more about these pursuers than you do. You fear them, but you do not fear them enough, yet. Tomorrow you will have to escape, if you can. Strider can take you by paths that are seldom trodden. Will you have him?\u0027\\n\\n There was a heavy silence. Frodo made no answer, his mind was confused with doubt and fear. Sam frowned, and looked at his master; and at last he broke out:\\n\\n \u0027With your leave, Mr. Frodo, I\u0027d say no! This Strider here, he warns and he says take care; and I say yes to that, and let\u0027s begin with him. He comes out of the Wild, and I never heard no good of such folk. He knows something, that\u0027s plain, and more than I like; but it\u0027s no reason why we should let him go leading us out into some dark place far from help, as he puts it.\u0027\\n\\n Pippin fidgeted and looked uncomfortable. Strider did not reply to Sam, but turned his keen eyes on Frodo. Frodo caught his glance and looked away. \u0027No,\u0027 he said slowly. \u0027I don\u0027t agree. I think, I think you are not really as you choose to look. You began to talk to me like the Bree-folk, but your voice has changed. Still Sam seems right in this: I don\u0027t see why you should warn us to take care, and yet ask us to take you on trust. Why the disguise? Who are you? What do you really know about �C about my business; and how do you know it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The lesson in caution has been well learned,\u0027 said Strider with a grim smile. \u0027But caution is one thing and wavering is another. You will never get to Rivendell now on your own, and to trust me is your only chance. You must make up your mind. I will answer some of your questions, if that will help you to do so. But why should you believe my story, if you do not trust me already? Still here it is�C\u0027\\n\\n At that moment there came a knock at the door. Mr. Butterbur had arrived with candles, and behind him was Nob with cans of hot water. Strider withdrew into a dark corner.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve come to bid you good night,\u0027 said the landlord, putting the candles on the table. \u0027Nob! Take the water to the rooms!\u0027 He came in and shut the door.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s like this,\u0027 he began, hesitating and looking troubled. \u0027If I\u0027ve done any harm, I\u0027m sorry indeed. But one thing drives out another, as you\u0027ll admit; and I\u0027m a busy man. But first one thing and then another this week have jogged my memory, as the saying goes; and not too late I hope. You see, I was asked to look out for hobbits of the Shire, and for one by the name of Baggins in particular.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And what has that got to do with me?\u0027 asked Frodo.\\n\\n \u0027Ah! you know best,\u0027 said the landlord, knowingly. \u0027I won\u0027t give you away; but I was told that this Baggins would be going by the name of Underhill, and I was given a description that fits you well enough, if I may say so.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Indeed! Let\u0027s have it then!\u0027 said Frodo, unwisely interrupting.\\n\\n \u0027A stout little fellow with red cheeks,\u0027 said Mr. Butterbur solemnly. Pippin chuckled, but Sam looked indignant. \u0027That won\u0027t help you much; it goes for most hobbits, Barley, he says to me,\u0027 continued Mr. Butterbur with a glance at Pippin. \u0027But this one is taller than some and fairer than most, and he has a cleft in his chin: perky chap with a bright eye. Begging your pardon, but he said it, not me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He said it? And who was he?\u0027 asked Frodo eagerly.\\n\\n \u0027Ah! That was Gandalf, if you know who I mean. A wizard they say he is, but he\u0027s a good friend of mine, whether or no. But now I don\u0027t know what he\u0027ll have to say to me, if I see him again: turn all my ale sour or me into a block of wood, I shouldn\u0027t wonder. He\u0027s a bit hasty. Still what\u0027s done can\u0027t be undone.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, what have you done?\u0027 said Frodo, getting impatient with the slow unravelling of Butterbur\u0027s thoughts.\\n\\n \u0027Where was I?\u0027 said the landlord, pausing and snapping his fingers. \u0027Ah, yes! Old Gandalf. Three months back he walked right into my room without a knock. Barley, he says, I\u0027m off in the morning. Will you do something for me? You\u0027ve only to name it, I said. I\u0027m in a hurry, said he, and I\u0027ve no time myself, but I want a message took to the Shire. Have you anyone you can send, and trust to go? I can find someone, I said, tomorrow, maybe, or the day after. Make it tomorrow, he says, and then he gave me a letter.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s addressed plain enough,\u0027 said Mr. Butterbur, producing a letter from his pocket, and reading out the address slowly and proudly (he valued his reputation as a lettered man):\\n\\n Mr FRODO BAGGINS, BAG END, HOBBITON in the SHIRE.\\n\\n \u0027A letter for me from Gandalf!\u0027 cried Frodo.\\n\\n \u0027Ah!\u0027 said Mr. Butterbur. \u0027Then your right name is Baggins?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It is,\u0027 said Frodo, \u0027and you had better give me that letter at once, and explain why you never sent it. That\u0027s what you came to tell me, I suppose, though you\u0027ve taken a long time to come to the point.\u0027\\n\\n Poor Mr. Butterbur looked troubled. \u0027You\u0027re right, master,\u0027 he said, \u0027and I beg your pardon. And I\u0027m mortal afraid of what Gandalf will say, if harm comes of it. But I didn\u0027t keep it back a-purpose. I put it by safe. Then I couldn\u0027t find nobody willing to go to the Shire next day, nor the day after, and none of my own folk were to spare; and then one thing after another drove it out of my mind. I\u0027m a busy man. I\u0027ll do what I can to set matters right, and if there\u0027s any help I can give, you\u0027ve only to name it.\\n\\n \u0027Leaving the letter aside, I promised Gandalf no less. Barley, he says to me, this friend of mine from the Shire, he may be coming out this way before long, him and another. He\u0027ll be calling himself Underhill. Mind that! But you need ask no questions. And if I\u0027m not with him, he may be in trouble, and he may need help. Do whatever you can for him, and I\u0027ll be grateful, he says. And here you are, and trouble is not far off, seemingly.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What do you mean?\u0027 asked Frodo.\\n\\n \u0027These black men,\u0027 said the landlord lowering his voice. \u0027They\u0027re looking for Baggins, and if they mean well, then I\u0027m a hobbit. It was on Monday, and all the dogs were yammering and the geese screaming. Uncanny, I called it. Nob, he came and told me that two black men were at the door asking for a hobbit called Baggins. Nob\u0027s hair was all stood on end. I bid the black fellows be off, and slammed the door on them; but they\u0027ve been asking the same question all the way to Archet, I hear. And that Ranger, Strider, he\u0027s been asking questions, too. Tried to get in here to see you, before you\u0027d had bite or sup, he did.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He did!\u0027 said Strider suddenly, coming forward into the light. \u0027And much trouble would have been saved, if you had let him in, Barliman.\u0027\\n\\n The landlord jumped with surprise. \u0027You!\u0027 he cried. \u0027You\u0027re always popping up. What do you want now?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027s here with my leave,\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027He came to offer me his help.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, you know your own business, maybe,\u0027 said Mr. Butterbur, looking suspiciously at Strider. \u0027But if I was in your plight, I wouldn\u0027t take up with a Ranger.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then who would you take up with?\u0027 asked Strider. \u0027A fat innkeeper who only remembers his own name because people shout it at him all day? They cannot stay in The Pony for ever, and they cannot go home. They have a long road before them. Will you go with them and keep the black men off?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Me? Leave Bree! I wouldn\u0027t do that for any money,\u0027 said Mr. Butterbur, looking really scared. \u0027But why can\u0027t you stay here quiet for a bit, Mr. Underhill? What are all these queer goings on? What are these black men after, and where do they come from, I\u0027d like to know?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m sorry I can\u0027t explain it all,\u0027 answered Frodo. \u0027I am tired and very worried, and it\u0027s a long tale. But if you mean to help me, I ought to warn you that you will be in danger as long as I am in your house. These Black Riders: I am not sure, but I think, I fear they come from�C\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They come from Mordor,\u0027 said Strider in a low voice. \u0027From Mordor, Barliman, if that means anything to you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Save us!\u0027 cried Mr. Butterbur turning pale; the name evidently was known to him. \u0027That is the worst news that has come to Bree in my time.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It is,\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027Are you still willing to help me?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I am,\u0027 said Mr. Butterbur. \u0027More than ever. Though I don\u0027t know what the likes of me can do against, against�C\u0027 he faltered.\\n\\n \u0027Against the Shadow in the East,\u0027 said Strider quietly. \u0027Not much, Barliman, but every little helps. You can let Mr. Underhill stay here tonight, as Mr. Underhill, and you can forget the name of Baggins, till he is far away.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll do that,\u0027 said Butterbur. \u0027But they\u0027ll find out he\u0027s here without help from me, I\u0027m afraid. It\u0027s a pity Mr. Baggins drew attention to himself this evening, to say no more. The story of that Mr. Bilbo\u0027s going off has been heard before tonight in Bree. Even our Nob has been doing some guessing in his slow pate: and there are others in Bree quicker in the uptake than he is.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, we can only hope the Riders won\u0027t come back yet,\u0027 said Frodo.\\n\\n \u0027I hope not, indeed,\u0027 said Butterbur. \u0027But spooks or no spooks, they won\u0027t get in The Pony so easy. Don\u0027t you worry till the morning. Nob\u0027ll say no word. No black man shall pass my doors, while I can stand on my legs. Me and my folk\u0027ll keep watch tonight; but you had best get some sleep, if you can.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027In any case we must be called at dawn,\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027We must get off as early as possible. Breakfast at six-thirty, please.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Right! I\u0027ll see to the orders,\u0027 said the landlord. \u0027Good night, Mr. Baggins �C Underhill, I should say! Good night �C now, bless me! Where\u0027s your Mr. Brandybuck?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 said Frodo with sudden anxiety. They had forgotten all about Merry, and it was getting late. \u0027I am afraid he is out. He said something about going for a breath of air.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, you do want looking after and no mistake: your party might be on a holiday!\u0027 said Butterbur. \u0027I must go and bar the doors quick, but I\u0027ll see your friend is let in when he comes. I\u0027d better send Nob to look for him. Good night to you all!\u0027 At last Mr. Butterbur went out, with another doubtful look at Strider and a shake of his head. His footsteps retreated down the passage.\\n\\n \u0027Well?\u0027 said Strider. \u0027When are you going to open that letter?\u0027 Frodo looked carefully at the seal before he broke it. It seemed certainly to be Gandalf\u0027s. Inside, written in the wizard\u0027s strong but graceful script, was the following message:\\n\\n THE PRANCING PONY, BREE. Midyear\u0027s Day, Shire Year, 1418.\\n\\n Dear Frodo,\\n\\n Bad news has reached me here. I must go off at once. You had better leave Bag End soon, and get out of the Shire before the end of July at latest. I will return as soon as I can; and I will follow you, if I find that you are gone. Leave a message for me here, if you pass through Bree. You can trust the landlord (Butterbur). You may meet a friend of mine on the Road: a Man, lean, dark, tall, by some called Strider. He knows our business and will help you. Make for Rivendell. There I hope we may meet again. If I do not come, Elrond will advise you.\\n\\n Yours in haste\\n\\n GANDALF.\\n\\n PS. Do NOT use It again, not far any reason whatever! Do not travel by night!\\n\\n PPS. Make sure that it is the real Strider. There are many strange men on the roads. His true name is Aragorn.\\n\\n All that is gold does not glitter,\\n\\n Not all those who wander are lost;\\n\\n The old that is strong does not wither,\\n\\n Deep roots are not reached by the frost.\\n\\n From the ashes a fire shall be woken,\\n\\n A light from the shadows shall spring;\\n\\n Renewed shall be blade that was broken,\\n\\n The crownless again shall be king.\\n\\n PPPS. I hope Butterbur sends this promptly. A worthy man, but his memory is like a lumber-roam: thing wanted always buried. If he forgets, I shall roast him.\\n\\n Fare Well!\\n\\n Frodo read the letter to himself, and then passed it to Pippin and Sam. \u0027Really old Butterbur has made a mess of things!\u0027 he said. \u0027He deserves roasting. If I had got this at once, we might all have been safe in Rivendell by now. But what can have happened to Gandalf? He writes as if he was going into great danger.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He has been doing that for many years,\u0027 said Strider.\\n\\n Frodo turned and looked at him thoughtfully, wondering about Gandalf\u0027s second postscript. \u0027Why didn\u0027t you tell me that you were Gandalf\u0027s friend at once?\u0027 he asked. \u0027It would have saved time.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Would it? Would any of you have believed me till now?\u0027 said Strider. \u0027I knew nothing of this letter. For all I knew I had to persuade you to trust me without proofs, if I was to help you. In any case, I did not intend to tell you all about myself at once. I had to study you first, and make sure of you. The Enemy has set traps for me before now. As soon as I had made up my mind, I was ready to tell you whatever you asked. But I must admit,\u0027 he added with a queer laugh, \u0027that I hoped you would take to me for my own sake. A hunted man sometimes wearies of distrust and longs for friendship. But there, I believe my looks are against me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They are �C at first sight at any rate,\u0027 laughed Pippin with sudden relief after reading Gandalf\u0027s letter. \u0027But handsome is as handsome does, as we say in the Shire; and I daresay we shall all look much the same after lying for days in hedges and ditches.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It would take more than a few days, or weeks, or years, of wandering in the Wild to make you look like Strider,\u0027 he answered. \u0027And you would die first, unless you are made of sterner stuff than you look to be.\u0027\\n\\n Pippin subsided; but Sam was not daunted, and he still eyed Strider dubiously. \u0027How do we know you are the Strider that Gandalf speaks about?\u0027 he demanded. \u0027You never mentioned Gandalf, till this letter came out. You might be a play-acting spy, for all I can see, trying to get us to go with you. You might have done in the real Strider and took his clothes. What have you to say to that?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That you are a stout fellow,\u0027 answered Strider; \u0027but I am afraid my only answer to you, Sam Gamgee, is this. If I had killed the real Strider, I could kill you. And I should have killed you already without so much talk. If I was after the Ring, I could have it �C NOW!\u0027\\n\\n He stood up, and seemed suddenly to grow taller. In his eyes gleamed a light, keen and commanding. Throwing back his cloak, he laid his hand on the hilt of a sword that had hung concealed by his side. They did not dare to move. Sam sat wide-mouthed staring at him dumbly.\\n\\n \u0027But I am the real Strider, fortunately,\u0027 he said, looking down at them with his face softened by a sudden smile. \u0027I am Aragorn son of Arathorn; and if by life or death I can save you, I will.\u0027\\n\\n There was a long silence. At last Frodo spoke with hesitation. \u0027I believed that you were a friend before the letter came,\u0027 he said, \u0027or at least I wished to. You have frightened me several times tonight, but never in the way that servants of the Enemy would, or so I imagine. I think one of his spies would �C well, seem fairer and feel fouler, if you understand.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I see,\u0027 laughed Strider. \u0027I look foul and feel fair. Is that it? All that is gold does not glitter, not all those who wanderare lost.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Did the verses apply to you then?\u0027 asked Frodo. \u0027I could not make out what they were about. But how did you know that they were in Gandalf\u0027s letter, if you have never seen it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I did not know,\u0027 he answered. \u0027But I am Aragorn, and those verses go with that name.\u0027 He drew out his sword, and they saw that the blade was indeed broken a foot below the hilt. \u0027Not much use is it, Sam?\u0027 said Strider. \u0027But the time is near when it shall be forged anew.\u0027\\n\\n Sam said nothing.\\n\\n \u0027Well,\u0027 said Strider, \u0027with Sam\u0027s permission we will call that settled. Strider shall be your guide. We shall have a rough road tomorrow. Even if we are allowed to leave Bree unhindered, we can hardly hope now to leave it unnoticed. But I shall try to get lost as soon as possible. I know one or two ways out of Bree-land other than the main road. If once we shake off the pursuit, I shall make for Weathertop.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Weathertop?\u0027 said Sam. \u0027What\u0027s that?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It is a hill, just to the north of the Road, about half way from here to Rivendell. It commands a wide view all round; and there we shall have a chance to look about us. Gandalf will make for that point, if he follows us. After Weathertop our journey will become more difficult, and we shall have to choose between various dangers.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027When did you last see Gandalf?\u0027 asked Frodo. \u0027Do you know where he is, or what he is doing?\u0027\\n\\n Strider looked grave. \u0027I do not know,\u0027 he said. \u0027I came west with him in the spring. I have often kept watch on the borders of the Shire in the last few years, when he was busy elsewhere. He seldom left it unguarded. We last met on the first of May: at Sarn Ford down the Brandywine. He told me that his business with you had gone well, and that you would be starting for Rivendell in the last week of September. As I knew he was at your side, I went away on a journey of my own. And that has proved ill; for plainly some news reached him, and I was not at hand to help.\\n\\n \u0027I am troubled, for the first time since I have known him. We should have had messages, even if he could not come himself. When I returned, many days ago, I heard the ill news. The tidings had gone far and wide that Gandalf was missing and the horsemen had been seen. It was the Elven-folk of Gildor that told me this; and later they told me that you had left your home; but there was no news of your leaving Buckland. I have been watching the East Road anxiously.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Do you think the Black Riders have anything to do with it �C with Gandalf\u0027s absence, I mean?\u0027 asked Frodo.\\n\\n \u0027I do not know of anything else that could have hindered him, except the Enemy himself,\u0027 said Strider. \u0027But do not give up hope! Gandalf is greater than you Shire-folk know �C as a rule you can only see his jokes and toys. But this business of ours will be his greatest task.\u0027\\n\\n Pippin yawned. \u0027I am sorry,\u0027 he said, \u0027but I am dead tired. In spite of all the danger and worry I must go to bed, or sleep where I sit. Where is that silly fellow, Merry? It would be the last straw, if we had to go out in the dark to look for him.\u0027\\n\\n At that moment they heard a door slam; then feet came running along the passage. Merry came in with a rush followed by Nob. He shut the door hastily, and leaned against it. He was out of breath. They stared at him in alarm for a moment before he gasped: \u0027I have seen them, Frodo! I have seen them! Black Riders!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Black Riders!\u0027 cried Frodo. \u0027Where?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Here. In the village. I stayed indoors for an hour. Then as you did not come back, I went out for a stroll. I had come back again and was standing just outside the light of the lamp looking at the stars. Suddenly I shivered and felt that something horrible was creeping near: there was a sort of deeper shade among the shadows across the road, just beyond the edge of the lamplight. It slid away at once into the dark without a sound. There was no horse.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Which way did it go?\u0027 asked Strider, suddenly and sharply. Merry started, noticing the stranger for the first time. \u0027Go on!\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027This is a friend of Gandalf\u0027s. I will explain later.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It seemed to make off up the Road, eastward,\u0027 continued Merry. \u0027I tried to follow. Of course, it vanished almost at once; but I went round the corner and on as far as the last house on the Road.\u0027\\n\\n Strider looked at Merry with wonder. \u0027You have a stout heart,\u0027 he said; \u0027but it was foolish.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 said Merry. \u0027Neither brave nor silly, I think. I could hardly help myself. I seemed to be drawn somehow. Anyway, I went, and suddenly I heard voices by the hedge. One was muttering; and the other was whispering, or hissing. I couldn\u0027t hear a word that was said. I did not creep any closer, because I began to tremble all over. Then I felt terrified, and I turned back, and was just going to bolt home, when something came behind me and I... I fell over.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I found him, sir,\u0027 put in Nob. \u0027Mr. Butterbur sent me out with a lantern. I went down to West-gate, and then back up towards South-gate. Just nigh Bill Ferny\u0027s house I thought I could see something in the Road. I couldn\u0027t swear to it, but it looked to me as if two men was stooping over something, lilting it. I gave a shout, but where I got up to the spot there was no signs of them, and only Mr. Brandybuck lying by the roadside. He seemed to be asleep. \"I thought I had fallen into deep water,\" he says to me, when I shook him. Very queer he was, and as soon as I had roused him, he got up and ran back here like a hare.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I am afraid that\u0027s true,\u0027 said Merry, \u0027though I don\u0027t know what I said. I had an ugly dream, which I can\u0027t remember. I went to pieces. I don\u0027t know what came over me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I do,\u0027 said Strider. \u0027The Black Breath. The Riders must have left their horses outside, and passed back through the South-gate in secret. They will know all the news now, for they have visited Bill Ferny; and probably that Southerner was a spy as well. Something may happen in the night, before we leave Bree.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What will happen?\u0027 said Merry. \u0027Will they attack the inn?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, I think not,\u0027 said Strider. \u0027They are not all here yet. And in any case that is not their way. In dark and loneliness they are strongest; they will not openly attack a house where there are lights and many people �C not until they are desperate, not while all the long leagues of Eriador still lie before us. But their power is in terror, and already some in Bree are in their clutch. They will drive these wretches to some evil work: Ferny, and some of the strangers, and, maybe, the gatekeeper too. They had words with Harry at West-gate on Monday. I was watching them. He was white and shaking when they left him.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We seem to have enemies all round,\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027What are we to do?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Stay here, and do not go to your rooms! They are sure to have found out which those are. The hobbit-rooms have windows looking north and close to the ground. We will all remain together and bar this window and the door. But first Nob and I will fetch your luggage.\u0027\\n\\n While Strider was gone, Frodo gave Merry a rapid account of all that had happened since supper. Merry was still reading and pondering Gandalf\u0027s letter when Strider and Nob returned.\\n\\n \u0027Well Masters,\u0027 said Nob, \u0027I\u0027ve ruffled up the clothes and put in a bolster down the middle of each bed. And I made a nice imitation of your head with a brown woollen mat, Mr. Bag �C Underhill, sir,\u0027 he added with a grin.\\n\\n Pippin laughed. \u0027Very life-like!\u0027 he said. \u0027But what will happen when they have penetrated the disguise?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We shall see,\u0027 said Strider. \u0027Let us hope to hold the fort till morning.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Good night to you,\u0027 said Nob, and went off to take his part in the watch on the doors.\\n\\n Their bags and gear they piled on the parlour-floor. They pushed a low chair against the door and shut the window. Peering out, Frodo saw that the night was still clear. The Sickle was swinging bright above the shoulders of Bree-hill. He then closed and barred the heavy inside shutters and drew the curtains together. Strider built up the fire and blew out all the candles.\\n\\n The hobbits lay down on their blankets with their feet towards the hearth; but Strider settled himself in the chair against the door. They talked for a little, for Merry still had several questions to ask.\\n\\n \u0027Jumped over the Moon!\u0027 chuckled Merry as he rolled himself in his blanket. \u0027Very ridiculous of you, Frodo! But I wish I had been there to see. The worthies of Bree will be discussing it a hundred years hence.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I hope so,\u0027 said Strider. Then they all fell silent, and one by one the hobbits dropped off to sleep. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-fellowship-of-the-ring-the-lord-of-the-rings-1/page-12.html","bookId":1540,"book":{"id":1540,"title":"The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings #1)","description":"Storyline: The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings #1) \\n Frodo Baggins knew the Ringwraiths were searching for him - and the Ring of Power he bore that would enable Sauron to destroy all that was good in Middle-earth.
