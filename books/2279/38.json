You look like you need a cool one.”\\n\\n “Thanks, but I’m looking for Kelsey.”\\n\\n “She’s in her room.”\\n\\n He started to leave, then hesitated. “Where’s Corey Simmons? Doesn’t he usually hang out here around this time?”\\n\\n “He was going to pass out,” Ricky said. “I convinced him to go to bed.”\\n\\n Logan dashed up the stairs. As he reached the gallery, his heart quickened when he heard a sharp cry from the area of Kelsey’s room.\\n\\n Room 207.\\n\\n And Corey Simmons was up here, too.\\n\\n He ran the rest of the way to her room and tried the door. It was locked. He stepped back to slam his shoulder against it to break in. As he did, Kelsey opened the door. She was covered with white dust, but she stepped back quickly, letting him in.\\n\\n He looked around the room. Plaster dust was everywhere; part of the wall had been torn out.\\n\\n Logan turned back to Kelsey. She gave him a wistful smile of both triumph and sadness. “I’ve found Sierra Monte,” she said quietly, and pointed to the gaping hole in the wall.\\n\\n Chapter Fourteen\\n\\n Kelsey took Logan over to the wall she’d begun to dismantle and the corpse that had been lodged there.\\n\\n Tearing the wall apart hadn’t been easy.\\n\\n Using only her pocketknife, she’d systematically cut through the drywall and old lathing. She’d done her best to keep the damage down, knowing that this was her friend’s place of business, and yet she’d been absolutely convinced the woman’s ghost clung to that area for a reason.\\n\\n Logan closed the door and locked it.\\n\\n “Did you just cry out?” he asked.\\n\\n “Yes, I didn’t mean to, but when I found the body…”\\n\\n He leaned against the door, giving her a chance to explain.\\n\\n “I know it looks crazy, but the logic is really simple. Think about it. The blood had been all over the room, nowhere else. Sierra Monte was definitely killed here, but the team working the case believed the body had been taken elsewhere because she wasn’t here. The inn was being renovated at the time. Most of the rooms had just been redone, so no one would notice this particular section of wall… . And while Sandy would’ve repainted, there was no reason for her to dig into walls that had recently been repaired when she had so much else to work on. It’s all logical,” Kelsey insisted.\\n\\n He was watching her, his expression skeptical.\\n\\n She sighed. “Okay, screw logic. The shadow on the film was in this area, and today I saw them, Logan. I saw them both. Sierra and Rose. They were hovering in this corner.”\\n\\n Logan walked toward her, still silent. He came to stand directly in front of her, and then he reached down, planting an enormous kiss on her lips.\\n\\n “You’re brilliant!” he told her.\\n\\n She smiled. “And now you’re covered in plaster, too. I’ve got a disaster going here, but I didn’t want to make too much noise and I didn’t want to ask Sandy’s permission… . We have to call in forensics, though. I’m not sure of my sanity in this—Sandy has so much to deal with right now—but this is a murdered woman, someone who was flesh and blood.”\\n\\n Logan pulled out his phone. “I’m calling Jackson. He’ll do this from the FBI end, and he can bring in Kat and he’ll let me call the shots on the crime scene, though God knows we never seem to get anything from the bodies. Still, there’s always that one time a killer makes a mistake, and we could get a hair or a fiber or something. Maybe even DNA that matches DNA in the system.”\\n\\n As he spoke to Jackson Crow, he inspected the wall she’d dug out, using nothing but that small knife. She’d ripped through drywall and lathe, slowly and methodically. It had been worth it.\\n\\n Within twenty minutes, Jackson Crow had arrived with Kat Sokolov. He inspected Kelsey’s finding, as well, and stood silently for a few minutes, considering the situation. “We need crime-scene people here,” he said flatly.\\n\\n “I need her out of the wall,” Kat told them.\\n\\n “But Ted Murphy is down there, not to mention the fact that the place is jumping,” Kelsey said.\\n\\n “Murphy is going to be a sensationalist no matter what we do.” Logan shrugged. “Nothing’s going to change that. Kelsey, do you want to tell Sandy what you found? We don’t have to clear the bar—there’s no point. But we have to have our people in here. We can rope off the upstairs, and only overnight guests can have access to the gallery.”\\n\\n “What do we tell the customers down there?” Kelsey asked.\\n\\n “Nothing,” Logan said wearily, wiping plaster dust from his cheek. “We’ll get a spokesperson on it. Other than that, they can guess all they want.”\\n\\n Kelsey walked over to the door.\\n\\n “Kelsey.” Logan stopped her.\\n\\n He sent her a wry grin. “If you go downstairs looking like that, people are going to think you’re the ghost of Room 207.”\\n\\n “Oh. Yes.” Kelsey nodded, and headed into the bathroom. She tried washing her face and shaking out her hair. Kat came in behind her and began patting at her clothes.\\n\\n Kelsey studied herself in the mirror. She and Kat seemed to have gotten off most of the paint chips and plaster dust, and she looked more or less presentable. She brushed her hair and put on some fresh makeup, then squared her shoulders.\\n\\n “Ready.”\\n\\n It was with an almost unbearable pain in her heart that she went down and sought out Sandy. She was going to tell the friend who’d given her hospitality that she might be about to destroy not just her business but her dream. However, the Longhorn had survived before. It would do so again.\\n\\n She saw Ted Murphy, ostensibly chatting with friends at one of the tables. He’d stay away from Logan, she was sure.\\n\\n But he watched. He watched all the time.\\n\\n She saw Bernie Firestone and Earl Candy at the bar, and they both hailed her with friendly waves. She waved back, but kept searching the crowd for Sandy.\\n\\n She found her sitting, enthralled, with Jeff Chasson.\\n\\n Kelsey wondered why she felt so protective of her. Sandy was very pretty, and there was no reason she couldn’t attract the sexiest man in any crowd. But Kelsey didn’t believe that anything about Jeff Chasson was real. Why he would want more information on the grisly doings at the Longhorn, she didn’t know. But she felt he was a worm, trying to wriggle his way into something.\\n\\n And now, of course, he was there when she needed to speak with Sandy alone. As she walked over to the table, Chasson looked up at her and stood, offering her a strange smile. She had the feeling that he was always on the lookout for whatever he might be able to use. Or another conquest, perhaps…\\n\\n “Marshal O’Brien. Have a drink with us?”\\n\\n “I’m so sorry,” Kelsey replied. “But I’ve come to steal Sandy away from you for a few minutes. Sandy, please?”\\n\\n Sandy frowned at her. “Kelsey, Jeff and I were sharing some experiences. Can’t you just talk to us both?”\\n\\n “I really need to speak with you alone,” Kelsey said.\\n\\n Sandy got to her feet, giving Kelsey a look of confused anger.\\n\\n “Please,” Kelsey murmured.\\n\\n As she gripped Sandy’s arm to lead her toward the stairs, Sandy pulled back. “What are you doing to me? He’s the best possibility I’ve had of sex with anything decent in, like, forever!”\\n\\n “Sandy, you have to give me a minute.”\\n\\n But Sandy wrenched her arm away. “What? What? I know your work’s all-important, and that you’re big-shot law stuff but, Kelsey, come on! We lower mortals need lives, too!”\\n\\n That startled Kelsey and angered her. “Sandy, I found Sierra Monte!” she snapped.\\n\\n “What?” Sandy’s cry and the white look of pure horror on her face made Kelsey feel instantly sorry and apologetic that she’d blurted out the words.\\n\\n “She was in the wall,” Kelsey said.\\n\\n “You…you…found her? In the wall? My wall?” Sandy asked. “No, oh, no. No, no, no. Not all this again. Oh, my God. Oh, Lord.”\\n\\n Kelsey was afraid Sandy was going to faint. But when she tried to help her, Sandy shook her off and stood on her own. “Why?” she asked, and it sounded as if she was going to cry. “Why were you digging in my wall?”\\n\\n “It was logical, Sandy, and she was there.”\\n\\n “I didn’t know for sure she was dead…and if I didn’t know, I didn’t have to care. Oh, Kelsey!”\\n\\n “Sandy, please! The girl was brutally murdered.”\\n\\n “I know, and I’m sorry, and…and now—”\\n\\n “We’re going to handle it as carefully as possible. All we have to do is block off the gallery, so our crime-scene people can make it through. We have to get her out of the wall, Sandy.”\\n\\n Sandy stared at her blankly.\\n\\n “You don’t have to clear out the bar, and you don’t have to do anything tonight. I’ll bring them in discreetly. Overnight guests will still be able to get to their rooms,” Kelsey said quickly.\\n\\n Sandy seemed to be letting it all sink in. “No. No. I’ll take care of this. You go ahead and call the people you have to call.”\\n\\n Sandy escaped her and headed for the bar. She crawled up on one of the stools with the help of the surprised cowboy she’d rather rudely unseated.\\n\\n “Everyone, please!” she shouted.\\n\\n The piano player stopped playing. People were still talking, but Sandy raised her voice and shouted again. “Please! I have a very important announcement!”\\n\\n At last, the room went silent.\\n\\n Sandy pointed toward Kelsey. “My very good friend Marshal Kelsey O’Brien has done the Longhorn, and the city of San Antonio, a great service. God knows how she figured it out, but Kelsey has just solved a mystery that’s plagued our city’s finest—she’s discovered the remains of Sierra Monte, the young lady who disappeared from Room 207 about a year ago. And she found her right in Room 207.” \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-unseen-krewe-of-hunters-5/page-38.html","bookId":2279,"book":{"id":2279,"title":"The Unseen (Krewe of Hunters #5)","description":"Storyline: The Unseen (Krewe of Hunters #5) \\n 1800s.
