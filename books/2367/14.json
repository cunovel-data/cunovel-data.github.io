{"id":69082,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"Oliver stared at the paper unbelievingly. How could she have done that? He thought about how passionate she had been in bed. And he had completely misread it. It was a passion filled with hate, not love. There\u0027s no way I can ever stop her, Oliver thought despairingly.\\n\\n Senator Todd Davis looked at the front-page story and was aghast. He understood the power of the press, and he knew how much this vendetta could cost him. I\u0027ll have to stop her myself, Senator Davis decided.\\n\\n When he got to his Senate office, he telephoned Leslie. \"It\u0027s been a long time,\" Senator Davis said warmly. \"Too long. I think about you a lot, Miss Stewart.\"\\n\\n \"I think about you, too, Senator Davis. In a way, everything I have I owe to you.\"\\n\\n He chuckled. \"Not at all. When you had a problem, I was happy to be able to assist you.\"\\n\\n \"Is there something I can do for you, Senator?\"\\n\\n \"No, Miss Stewart. But there\u0027s something I\u0027d like to do for you. I\u0027m one of your faithful readers, you know, and I think the Tribune is a truly fine paper. I just realized that we haven\u0027t been doing any advertising in it, and I want to correct that. I\u0027m involved in several large companies, and they do a lot of advertising. I mean a lot of advertising. I think that a good portion of that should go to a fine paper like the Tribune.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m delighted to hear that, Senator. We can always use more advertising. Whom shall I have my advertising manager talk to?\"\\n\\n \"Well, before he talks to anyone, I think you and I should settle a little problem between us.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s that?\" Leslie asked.\\n\\n \"It concerns President Russell.\"\\n\\n \"Yes?\"\\n\\n \"This is a rather delicate matter, Miss Stewart. You said a few moments ago that you owed everything you have to me. Now I\u0027m asking you to do me a little favor.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll be happy to, if I can.\"\\n\\n \"In my own small way, I helped the president get elected to office.\"\\n\\n \"I know.\"\\n\\n \"And he\u0027s doing a fine job. Of course, it makes it more difficult for him when he\u0027s attacked by a powerful newspaper like the Tribune every time he turns around.\"\\n\\n \"What are you asking me to do, Senator?\"\\n\\n \"Well, I would greatly appreciate it if those attacks would stop.\"\\n\\n \"And in exchange for that, I can count on getting advertising from some of your companies.\"\\n\\n \"A great deal of advertising, Miss Stewart.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you, Senator. Why don\u0027t you call me back when you have something more to offer?\"\\n\\n And the line went dead.\\n\\n In his office at the Washington Tribune, Matt Baker was reading the story about President Russell\u0027s secret love nest.\\n\\n \"Who the hell authorized this?\" he snapped at his assistant.\\n\\n \"It came from the White Tower.\"\\n\\n \"Goddammit. She\u0027s not running this paper, I am.\" Why the hell do I put up with her? he wondered, not for the first time. Three hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year plus bonuses and stock options, he told himself wryly. Every time he was ready to quit, she seduced him with more money and more power. Besides, he had to admit to himself that it was fascinating working for one of the most powerful women in the world. There were things about her that he would never understand.\\n\\n When she had first bought the Tribune, Leshe had said to Matt, \"There\u0027s an astrologer I want you to hire. His name is Zoltaire.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s syndicated by our competition.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t care. Hire him.\"\\n\\n Later that day, Matt Baker told her, \"I checked on Zoltaire. It would be too expensive to buy out his contract.\"\\n\\n \"Buy it.\"\\n\\n The following week, Zoltaire, whose real name Matt learned was David Hayworth, came to work for the Washington Tribune. He was in his fifties, small and dark and intense.\\n\\n Matt was puzzled. Leshe did not seem like the kind of woman who would have any interest in astrology. As far as he could see, there was no contact between Leshe and David Hayworth.\\n\\n What he did not know was that Hayworth went to visit Leshe at her home whenever she had an important decision to make.\\n\\n On the first day, Matt had had Leshe\u0027s name put on the masthead: \"Leshe Chambers, Publisher.\" She had glanced at it and said, \"Change it. It\u0027s Leshe Stewart.\"\\n\\n The lady is on an ego trip. Matt had thought. But he was wrong. Leslie had decided to revert to her maiden name because she wanted Oliver Russell to know exactly who was responsible for what was going to happen to him.\\n\\n The day after Leslie took over the newspaper, she said, \"We\u0027re going to buy a health magazine.\"\\n\\n Matt looked at her curiously. \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"Because the health field is exploding.\"\\n\\n She had proved to be right. The magazine was an instant success.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re going to start expanding,\" Leslie told Baker. \"Let\u0027s get some people looking for publications overseas.\"\\n\\n \"All right.\"\\n\\n \"And there\u0027s too much fat around here. Get rid of the reporters who aren\u0027t pulling their weight.\"\\n\\n \"Leslie - \"\\n\\n \"I want young reporters who are hungry.\"\\n\\n When an executive position became open, Leslie insisted on being there for the interview. She would listen to the applicant, and then would ask one question: \"What\u0027s your golf score?\" The job would often depend on the answer.\\n\\n \"What the hell kind of question is that?\" Matt Baker asked the first time he heard it. \"What difference does a golf score make?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want people here who are dedicated to golf. If they work here, they\u0027re going to be dedicated to the Washington Tribune.\"\\n\\n Leshe Stewart\u0027s private life was a subject of endless discussions at the Tribune. She was a beautiful woman, unattached, and as far as anyone knew, she was not involved with any man and had no personal life. She was one of the capital\u0027s preeminent hostesses, and important people vied for an invitation to her dinner parties. But people speculated about what she did when all the guests had left and she was alone. There were rumors that she was an insomniac who spent the nights working, planning new projects for the Stewart empire.\\n\\n There were other rumors, more titillating, but there was no way of proving them.\\n\\n Leshe involved herself in everything: editorials, news stories, advertising. One day, she said to the head of the advertising department, \"Why aren\u0027t we getting any ads from Gleason\u0027s?\" - an upscale store in Georgetown.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve tried, but - -\"\\n\\n \"I know the owner. I\u0027ll give him a call.\"\\n\\n She called him and said, \"Allan, you\u0027re not giving the Tribune any ads. Why?\"\\n\\n He had laughed and said, \"Leshe, your readers are our shoplifters.\"\\n\\n Before Leslie went into a conference, she read up on everyone who would be there. She knew everyone\u0027s weaknesses and strengths, and she was a tough negotiator.\\n\\n \"Sometimes you can be too tough,\" Matt Baker warned her. \"You have to leave them something, Leslie.\"\\n\\n \"Forget it. I believe in the scorched-earth policy.\"\\n\\n In the course of the next year, Washington Tribune Enterprises acquired a newspaper and radio station in Australia, a television station in Denver, and a newspaper in Hammond, Indiana. Whenever there was a new acquisition, its employees were terrified of what was coming. Leslie\u0027s reputation for being ruthless was growing.\\n\\n Leslie Stewart was intensely jealous of Katharine Graham.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s just lucky,\" Leslie said. \"And she has the reputation of being a bitch.\"\\n\\n Matt Baker was tempted to ask Leslie what she thought her own reputation was, but he decided not to.\\n\\n One morning when Leslie arrived at her office, she found that someone had placed a small wooden block with two brass balls on her desk.\\n\\n Matt Baker was upset. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll take - \"\\n\\n \"No. Leave it.\"\\n\\n \"But - \"\\n\\n \"Leave it.\"\\n\\n Matt Baker was having a conference in his office when Leslie\u0027s voice came on over the intercom. \"Matt, come up here.\"\\n\\n No \"please,\" no \"good morning.\" It\u0027s going to be a bad-hair day, Matt Baker thought grimly. The Ice Princess was in one of her moods.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s it for now,\" Matt said.\\n\\n He left his office and walked through the corridors, where hundreds of employees were busily at work. He took the elevator up to the White Tower and entered the sumptuous publisher\u0027s office. Half a dozen editors were already gathered in the room.\\n\\n Behind an enormous desk sat Leslie Stewart. She looked up as Matt Baker entered. \"Let\u0027s get started.\"\\n\\n She had called an editorial meeting. Matt Baker remembered her saying, \"You\u0027ll be running the newspaper. I\u0027ll keep my hands off.\" He should have known better. She had no business calling meetings like this. That was his job. On the other hand, she was the publisher and owner of the Washington Tribune, and she could damn well do anything she pleased.\\n\\n Matt Baker said, \"I want to talk to you about the story about President Russell\u0027s love nest in Virginia.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s nothing to talk about,\" Leslie said. She held up a copy of The Washington Post, their rival. \"Have you seen this?\"\\n\\n Matt had seen it. \"Yes, it\u0027s just - \"\\n\\n \"In the old days it was called a scoop, Matt. Where were you and your reporters when the Post was getting the news?\"\\n\\n The headline in The Washington Post read: SECOND LOBBYIST TO BE INDICTED FOR GIVING ILLEGAL GIFTS TO SECRETARY OF DEFENSE.\\n\\n \"Why didn\u0027t we get that story?\"\\n\\n \"Because it isn\u0027t official yet. I checked on it. It\u0027s just - \"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t like being scooped.\"\\n\\n Matt Baker sighed and sat back in his chair. It was going to be a stormy session.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re number one, or we\u0027re nothing,\" Leslie Stewart announced to the group. \"And if we\u0027re nothing, there won\u0027t be any jobs here for anyone, will there?\"\\n\\n Leslie turned to Arnie Cohn, the editor of the Sunday magazine section. \"When people wake up Sunday morning, we want them to read the magazine section. We don\u0027t want to put our readers back to sleep. The stories we ran last Sunday were boring.\"\\n\\n He was thinking, If you were a man, I\u0027d - \"Sorry,\" he mumbled. \"I\u0027ll try to do better next time.\"\\n\\n Leslie turned to Jeff Connors, the sports editor. Connors was a good-looking man in his midthirties, tall, with an athletic build, blond hair, intelligent gray eyes. He had the easy manner of someone who knew that he was good at what he did. Matt had heard that Leshe had made a play for him, and he had turned her down.\\n\\n \"You wrote that Fielding was going to be traded to the Pirates.\"\\n\\n \"I was told - \"\\n\\n \"You were told wrong! The Tribune is guilty of printing a story that never happened.\"\\n\\n \"I got it from his manager,\" Jeff Connors said unperturbed. \"He told me that - \"\\n\\n \"Next time check out your stories, and then check them out again.\"\\n\\n Leslie turned and pointed to a framed, yellowed newspaper article hanging on the wall. It was the front page of the Chicago Tribune, dated November 3, 1948. The banner headline read: DEWEY DEFEATS TRUMAN.\\n\\n \"The worst thing a newspaper can do,\" Leslie said, \"is to get the facts wrong. We\u0027re in a business where you always have to get it right.\"\\n\\n She glanced at her watch. \"That\u0027s it for now. I\u0027ll expect you all to do a lot better.\" As they rose to leave, Leshe said to Matt Baker, \"I want you to stay.\"\\n\\n \"Right.\" He sank back into his chair and watched the others depart.\\n\\n \"Was I rough on them?\" she asked.\\n\\n \"You got what you wanted. They\u0027re all suicidal.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re not here to make friends, we\u0027re here to put out a newspaper.\" She looked up again at the framed front page on the wall. \"Can you imagine what the publisher of that paper must have felt after that story hit the streets and Truman was president? I never want to have that feeling, Matt. Never.\"\\n\\n \"Speaking of getting it wrong,\" Matt said, \"that story on page one about President Russell was more suitable for a cheap tabloid publication. Why do you keep riding him? Give him a chance.\"\\n\\n Leshe said enigmatically, \"I gave him his chance.\" She stood up and began to pace. \"I got a tip that Russell is going to veto the new communications bill. That means we\u0027ll have to call off the deal for the San Diego station and the Omaha station.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s nothing we can do about that.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, yes, there is. I want him out of office, Matt. We\u0027ll help put someone else in the White House, someone who knows what he\u0027s doing.\"\\n\\n Matt had no intention of getting into another argument with Leslie Stewart about the president. She was fanatic on the subject.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s not fit to be in that office, and I\u0027m going to do everything I can to make sure that he\u0027s defeated in the next election.\"\\n\\n Philip Cole, chief of correspondents for WTE, hurried into Matt Baker\u0027s office as Matt was ready to leave. There was a worried expression on his face. \"We have a problem, Matt.\"\\n\\n \"Can it wait until tomorrow? I\u0027m late for a - \"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s about Dana Evans.\"\\n\\n Matt said sharply, \"What about her?\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s been arrested.\"\\n\\n \"Arrested?\" Matt asked incredulously. \"What for?\"\\n\\n \"Espionage. Do you want me to - ?\"\\n\\n \"No. I\u0027ll handle this.\"\\n\\n Matt Baker hurried back to his desk and dialed the State Department. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-best-laid-plans/page-14.html","bookId":2367,"book":{"id":2367,"title":"The Best Laid Plans","description":"Storyline: He wanted power.
