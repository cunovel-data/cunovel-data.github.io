{"id":69085,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"The next morning at breakfast, Jan asked, \"Where were you last night, Oliver?\" Oliver\u0027s heart skipped a beat. But she could not possibly have known what happened. No one could. No one. \"I was meeting with - \" Jan cut him short. \"The meeting was called off. But you didn\u0027t get home until three o\u0027clock in the morning. I tried to reach you. Where were you?\" \"Well, something came up. Why? Did you need - ? Was something wrong?\" \"It doesn\u0027t matter now,\" Jan said wearily. \"Oliver, you\u0027re not just hurting me, you\u0027re hurting yourself. You\u0027ve come so far. I don\u0027t want to see you lose it all because - because you can\u0027t - \" Her eyes filled with tears. Oliver stood up and walked over to her. He put his arms around her. \"It\u0027s all right, Jan. Everything\u0027s fine. I love you very much.\" And I do, Oliver thought, in my own way. What happened last night wasn\u0027t my fault. She was the one who called. I never should have gone to meet her. He had taken every possible precaution not to be seen. I\u0027m in the clear, Oliver decided. Peter Tager was worried about Oliver. He had learned that it was impossible to control Oliver Russell\u0027s libido, and he had finally worked out an arrangement with him. On certain nights, Peter Tager set up fictitious meetings for the president to attend, away from the White House, and arranged for the Secret Service escort to disappear for a few hours. When Peter Tager had gone to Senator Davis to complain about what was happening, the senator had said calmly, \"Well, after all, Oliver is a very hot-blooded man, Peter. Sometimes it\u0027s impossible to control passions like that. I deeply admire your morals, Peter. I know how much your family means to you, and how distasteful the president\u0027s behavior must seem to you. But let\u0027s not be too judgmental. You just keep on seeing that everything is handled as discreetly as possible.\" Detective Nick Reese hated going into the forbidding, white-walled autopsy room. It smelled of formaldehyde and death. When he walked in the door, the coroner, Helen Chuan, a petite, attractive woman, was waiting for him. \"Morning,\" Reese said. \"Have you finished with the autopsy?\" \"I have a preliminary report for you, Nick. Jane Doe didn\u0027t die from her head injury. Her heart stopped before she hit the table. She died of an overdose of methylenedioxymethamphetamine.\" He sighed. \"Don\u0027t do this to me, Helen.\" \"Sorry. On the streets, it\u0027s called Ecstasy.\" She handed him a coroner\u0027s report. \"Here\u0027s what we have so far.\" AUTOPSY PROTOCOL NAME OF DECEDENT: JANE DOE FILE NO: C-L96I ANATOMIC SUMMARY DILATED AND HYPERTROPHIC CARDIOMYOPATHY CARDIOMEGALY (750 GM) LEFT VENTRICULAR HYPERTROPHY, HEART (2.3 CM) CONGESTIVE HEPATOMEGALY (2750 GM) CONGESTIVE SPLENOMEGALY (350 MG) ACUTE OPIATE INTOXICATION ACUTE PASSIVE CONGESTION, ALL VISCERA TOXICOLOGY (SEE SEPARATE REPORT) BRAIN HEMORRHAGE (SEE SEPARATE REPORT) CONCLUSION: (CAUSE OF DEATH) DILATED AND HYPERTROPHIC CARDIOMYOPATHY ACUTE OPIATE INTOXICATION Nick Reese looked up. \"So if you translated this into English, she died of a drug overdose of Ecstasy?\" \"Yes.\" \"Was she sexually assaulted?\" Helen Chuan hesitated. \"Her hymen had been broken, and there were traces of semen and a little blood along her thighs.\" \"So she was raped.\" \"I don\u0027t think so.\" \"What do you mean - you don\u0027t think so?\" Reese frowned. \"There were no signs of violence.\" Detective Reese was looking at her, puzzled. \"What are you saying?\" \"I think that Jane Doe was a virgin. This was her first sexual experience.\" Detective Reese stood there, digesting the information. Someone had been able to persuade a virgin to go up to the Imperial Suite and have sex with him. It would have had to be someone she knew. Or someone famous or powerful. The telephone rang. Helen Chuan picked it up. \"Coroner\u0027s office.\" She listened a moment, then handed the phone to the detective. \"It\u0027s for you.\" Nick Reese took the phone. \"Reese.\" His face brightened. \"Oh, yes, Mrs. Holbrook. Thanks for returning my call. It\u0027s a class ring from your school with the initials P.Y. on it. Do you have a female student with those initials?...I\u0027d appreciate it. Thank you. I\u0027ll wait.\" He looked up at the coroner. \"You\u0027re sure she couldn\u0027t have been raped?\" \"I found no signs of violence. None.\" \"Could she have been penetrated after she died?\" \"I would say no.\" Mrs. Holbrook\u0027s voice came back on the phone. \"Detective Reese?\" \"Yes.\" \"According to our computer, we do have a female student with the initials P.Y. Her name is Pauline Young.\" \"Could you describe her for me, Mrs. Holbrook?\" \"Why, yes. Pauline is eighteen. She\u0027s short and stocky, with dark hair...\" \"I see.\" Wrong girl. \"And that\u0027s the only one?\" \"The only female, yes.\" He picked up on it. \"You mean you have a male with those initials? \"Yes. Paul Yerby. He\u0027s a senior. As a matter of fact, Paul happens to be in Washington, D.C., right now.\" Detective Reese\u0027s heart began to beat faster. \"He\u0027s here?\" \"Yes. A class of students from Denver High is on a trip to Washington to visit the White House and Congress and - \" \"And they\u0027re all in the city now?\" \"That\u0027s right.\" \"Do you happen to know where they\u0027re staying?\" \"At the Hotel Lombardy. They gave us a group rate there. I talked with several of the other hotels, but they wouldn\u0027t - \" \"Thank you very much, Mrs. Holbrook. I appreciate it.\" Nick Reese replaced the receiver and turned to the coroner. \"Let me know when the autopsy is complete, will you, Helen?\" \"Of course. Good luck, Nick.\" He nodded. \"I think I\u0027ve just had it.\" The Hotel Lombardy is located on Pennsylvania Avenue, two blocks from Washington Circle and within walking distance of the White House, some monuments, and a subway station. Detective Reese walked into the old-fashioned lobby and approached the clerk behind the desk. \"Do you have a Paul Yerby registered here?\" \"I\u0027m sorry. We don\u0027t give out - \" Reese flashed his badge. \"I\u0027m in a big hurry, friend.\" \"Yes, sir.\" The clerk looked through his guest register. \"There\u0027s a Mr. Yerby in Room 315. Shall I - ?\" \"No, I\u0027ll surprise him. Stay away from the phone.\" Reese took the elevator, got off on the third floor, and walked down the corridor. He stopped before Room 315. He could hear voices inside. He unfastened the button of his jacket and knocked on the door. It was opened by a boy in his late teens. \"Hello.\" \"Paul Yerby?\" \"No.\" The boy turned to someone in the room. \"Paul, someone for you.\" Nick Reese pushed his way into the room. A slim, tousle-haired boy in jeans and a sweater was coming out of the bathroom. \"Paul Yerby?\" \"Yes. Who are you?\" Reese pulled out his badge. \"Detective Nick Reese. Homicide.\" The boy\u0027s complexion turned pale. \"I - what can I do for you?\" Nick Reese could smell the fear. He took the dead girl\u0027s ring from his pocket and held it out. \"Have you ever seen this ring before, Paul?\" \"No,\" Yerby said quickly. \"I - \" \"It has your initials on it.\" \"It has? Oh. Yeah.\" He hesitated. \"I guess it could be mine. I must have lost it somewhere.\" \"Or given it to someone?\" The boy licked his lips, \"Uh, yeah. I might have.\" \"Let\u0027s go downtown, Paul.\" The boy looked at him nervously. \"Am I under arrest?\" \"What for?\" Detective Reese asked. \"Have you committed a crime?\" \"Of course not. I...\" The words trailed off. \"Then why would I arrest you?\" \"I - I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t know why you want me to go downtown.\" He was eyeing the open door. Detective Reese reached out and took a grip on Paul\u0027s arm. \"Let\u0027s go quietly.\" The roommate said, \"Do you want me to call your mother or anybody, Paul?\" Paul Yerby shook his head, miserable. \"No. Don\u0027t call anyone.\" His voice was a whisper. The Henry I. Daly Building at 300 Indiana Avenue, NW, in downtown Washington is an unprepossessing six-story gray brick building that serves as police headquarters for the district. The Homicide Branch office is on the third floor. While Paul Yerby was being photographed and fingerprinted, Detective Reese went to see Captain Otto Miller. \"I think we got a break in the Monroe Arms case.\" Miller leaned back in his chair. \"Go on.\" \"I picked up the girl\u0027s boyfriend. The kid\u0027s scared out of his wits. We\u0027re going to question him now. Do you want to sit in?\" Captain Miller nodded toward a pile of papers heaped on his desk. \"I\u0027m busy for the next few months. Give me a report.\" \"Right.\" Detective Reese started toward the door. \"Nick - be sure to read him his rights.\" Paul Yerby was brought into an interrogation room. It was small, nine by twelve, with a battered desk, four chairs, and a video camera. There was a one-way mirror so that officers could watch the interrogation from the next room. Paul Yerby was facing Nick Reese and two other detectives, Doug Hogan and Edgar Bernstein. \"You\u0027re aware that we\u0027re videotaping this conversation?\" - Detective Reese \"Yes, sir.\" \"You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed to represent you.\" \"Would you like to have a lawyer present?\" - Detective Bernstein \"I don\u0027t need a lawyer.\" \"All right. You have a right to remain silent. If you waive that right, anything you say here can and will be used against you in a court of law. Is that clear?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"What\u0027s your legal name?\" \"Paul Yerby.\" \"Your address?\" \"Three-twenty Marion Street, Denver, Colorado. Look, I haven\u0027t done anything wrong. I - \" \"No one says you have. We\u0027re just trying to get some information, Paul. You\u0027d like to help us, wouldn\u0027t you?\" \"Sure, but I - I don\u0027t know what it\u0027s all about.\" \"Don\u0027t you have any idea?\" \"No, sir.\" \"Do you have any girlfriends, Paul?\" \"Well, you know...\" \"No, we don\u0027t know. Why don\u0027t you tell us?\" \"Well, sure. I see girls...\" \"You mean you date girls? You take girls out?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Do you date any one particular girl?\" There was a silence. \"Do you have a girlfriend, Paul?\" \"Yes.\" \"What\u0027s her name?\" - Detective Bernstein \"Chloe.\" \"Chloe what?\" - Detective Reese \"Chloe Houston.\" Reese made a note. \"What\u0027s her address, Paul?\" \"Six-oh-two Oak Street, Denver.\" \"What are her parents\u0027 names?\" \"She lives with her mother.\" \"And her name?\" \"Jackie Houston. She\u0027s the governor of Colorado.\" The detectives looked at one another. Shit! That\u0027s all we need! Reese held up a ring. \"Is this your ring, Paul?\" He studied it a moment, then said reluctantly, \"Yeah.\" \"Did you give Chloe this ring?\" He swallowed nervously. \"I - I guess I did.\" \"You\u0027re not sure?\" \"I remember now. Yes, I did.\" \"You came to Washington with some classmates, right? Kind of a school group?\" \"That\u0027s right.\" \"Was Chloe part of that group?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Where\u0027s Chloe now, Paul?\" - Detective Bernstein \"I - I don\u0027t know.\" \"When did you last see her?\" - Detective Hogan \"I guess a couple of days ago.\" \"Two days ago?\" - Detective Reese \"Yeah.\" \"And where was that?\" - Detective Bernstein \"In the White House.\" The detectives looked at one another in surprise. \"She was in the White House?\" Reese asked. \"Yes, sir. We were all on a private tour. Chloe\u0027s mother arranged it.\" \"And Chloe was with you?\" - Detective Hogan \"Yes.\" \"Did anything unusual happen on the tour?\" - Detective Bernstein \"What do you mean?\" \"Did you meet or talk to anyone on the tour?\" - Detective Bernstein \"Well, sure, the guide.\" \"And that\u0027s all?\" - Detective Reese \"That\u0027s right.\" \"Was Chloe with the group all the time?\" - Detective Hogan \"Yes - \" Yerby hesitated. \"No. She slipped away to go to the ladies\u0027 room. She was gone about fifteen minutes. When she came back, she - \" He stopped. \"She what?\" Reese asked. \"Nothing. She just came back.\" The boy was obviously lying. \"Son,\" Detective Reese asked, \"do you know that Chloe Houston is dead?\" They were watching him closely. \"No! My God! How?\" The surprised look on his face could have been feigned. \"Don\u0027t you know?\" - Detective Bernstein \"No! I - I can\u0027t believe it.\" \"You had nothing to do with her death?\" - Detective Hogan \"Of course not! I love...I loved Chloe.\" \"Did you ever go to bed with her?\" - Detective Bernstein \"No. We - we were waiting. We were going to get married.\" \"But sometimes you did drugs together?\" - Detective Reese \"No! We never did drugs.\" The door opened and a burly detective, Harry Carter, came into the room. He walked over to Reese and whispered something in his ear. Reese nodded. He sat there staring at Paul Yerby. \"When was the last time you saw Chloe Houston?\" \"I told you, in the White House.\" He shifted uncomfortably in his chair. Detective Reese leaned forward. \"You\u0027re in a lot of trouble, Paul. Your fingerprints are all over the Imperial Suite at the Monroe Arms Hotel. How did they get there?\" Paul Yerby sat there, pale-faced. \"You can quit lying now. We\u0027ve got you nailed.\" \"I - I didn\u0027t do anything.\" \"Did you book the suite at the Monroe Arms?\" - Detective Bernstein \"No, I didn\u0027t.\" The emphasis was on the \"I.\" Detective Reese pounced on it. \"But you know who did?\" \"No.\" The answer came too quickly. \"You admit you were in the suite?\" - Detective Hogan \"Yes, but - but Chloe was alive when I left.\" \"Why did you leave?\" - Detective Hogan \"She asked me to. She - she was expecting someone.\" \"Come on, Paul. We know you killed her.\" - Detective Bernstein \"No!\" He was trembling. \"I swear I had nothing to do with it. I - I just went up to the suite with her. I only stayed a little while.\" \"Because she was expecting someone?\" - Detective Reese \"Yes. She - she was kind of excited.\" \"Did she tell you who she was going to meet?\" - Detective Hogan He was licking his lips. \"No.\" \"You\u0027re lying. She did tell you.\" \"You said she was excited. What about?\" - Detective Reese Paul licked his lips again. \"About - about the man she was going to meet there for dinner.\" \"Who was the man, Paul?\" - Detective Bernstein \"I can\u0027t tell you.\" \"Why not?\" - Detective Hogan \"I promised Chloe I would never tell anyone.\" \"Chloe is dead.\" Paul Yerby\u0027s eyes filled with tears. \"I just can\u0027t believe it.\" \"Give us the man\u0027s name.\" - Detective Reese \"I can\u0027t do that. I promised.\" \"Here\u0027s what\u0027s going to happen to you: You\u0027re going to spend tonight in jail. In the morning, if you give us the name of the man she was going to meet, we\u0027ll let you go. Otherwise, we\u0027re going to book you for murder one.\" - Detective Reese They waited for him to speak. Silence. Nick Reese nodded to Bernstein. \"Take him away.\" Detective Reese returned to Captain Miller\u0027s office. \"I have bad news and I have worse news.\" \"I haven\u0027t time for this, Nick.\" \"The bad news is that I\u0027m not sure it was the boy who gave her the drug. The worse news is that the girl\u0027s mother is the governor of Colorado.\" \"Oh, God! The papers will love this.\" Captain Miller took a deep breath. \"Why don\u0027t you think the boy\u0027s guilty?\" \"He admits he was in the girl\u0027s suite, but he said she told him to leave because she was expecting someone. I think the kid\u0027s too smart to come up with a story that stupid. What I do believe is that he knows who Chloe Houston was expecting. He won\u0027t say who it was.\" \"Do you have any idea?\" \"It was her first time in Washington, and they were on a tour of the White House. She didn\u0027t know anyone here. She said she was going to the ladies\u0027 room. There is no public rest room in the White House. She would have had to go outside to the Visitor\u0027s Pavilion on the Ellipse at 15th and E streets or to the White House Visitor Center. She was gone about fifteen minutes. What I think happened is that while trying to find a ladies\u0027 room, she ran into someone in the White House, someone she might have recognized. Maybe someone she saw on TV. Anyway, it must have been somebody important. He led her to a private washroom and impressed her enough that she agreed to meet him at the Monroe Arms.\" Captain Miller was thoughtful. \"I\u0027d better call the White House. They asked to be kept up-to-date on this. Don\u0027t let up on the kid. I want that name.\" \"Right.\" As Detective Reese walked out the door, Captain Miller reached for the telephone and dialed a number. A few minutes later, he was saying, \"Yes, sir. We have a material witness in custody. He\u0027s in a holding cell at the Indiana Avenue police station....We won\u0027t, sir. I think the boy will give us the man\u0027s name tomorrow... Yes, sir. I understand.\" The line went dead. Captain Miller sighed and went back to the pile of papers on his desk. At eight o\u0027clock the following morning, when Detective Nick Reese went to Paul Yerby\u0027s cell, Yerby\u0027s body was hanging from one of the top bars.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-best-laid-plans/page-17.html","bookId":2367,"book":{"id":2367,"title":"The Best Laid Plans","description":"Storyline: He wanted power.
