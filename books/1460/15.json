{"id":35263,"no":15,"title":"CHAPTER XV.","content":"During the hot days and nights of the next few weeks Tredennis found life rather a dreary affair. Gradually the familiar faces he met on the avenue became fewer and fewer; the houses he knew one after another assumed their air of summer desertion, offering as their only evidences of life an occasional colored servant sunning him or herself on the steps; the crowds of nursery-maids, with their charges, thinned out in the parks, and the freshness of the leaves was lost under a coating of dust, while the countenances of those for whom there was no prospect of relief expressed either a languid sense of injury or the patience of despair. \"But, after all,\" Tredennis said, on two or three occasions, as he sat in one of the parks in the evening,—\"after all, I suppose most of them have—an object,\" adding the last two words with a faint smile. He was obliged to confess to himself that of late he found that the work which he had regarded as his object had ceased to satisfy him. He gave his attention to it with stern persistence, and refused to spare himself when he found his attention wandering; he even undertook additional labor, writing in his moments of leisure several notable articles upon various important questions of the day, and yet he had time left to hang heavily on his hands and fill him with weariness; and at last there came an evening when, after sitting in one of the parks until the lamps were lighted, he rose suddenly from his seat, and spoke as if to the silence and shadow about him. \"Why should I try to hide the truth from myself?\" he said. \"It is too late for that. I may as well face it like a man, and bear it like one. Many a brave [Pg 160]fellow has carried a bullet in his body down to his grave, and seldom winced. This is something like that, I suppose, only that pain\"—And he drew a sharp, hard breath, and walked away down the deserted path without ending the sentence. He made a struggle after this to resist one poor temptation which beset him daily,—the temptation to pass through the street in which stood the familiar house, with its drawn blinds and closed doors. Sometimes, when he rose in the morning, he was so filled with an unreasoning yearning for a sight of its blankness that he was overwhelmed by it, and went out before he breakfasted. \"It is weakness and self-indulgence,\" he would say; \"but it is a very little thing, and it can hurt no one—it is only a little thing, after all.\" And he found a piteous pleasure—at which at first he tried to smile, but at which before long he ceased even to try to smile—in the slow walk down the street, on which he could see this window or that, and remember some day when he had caught a glimpse of Bertha through it, or some night he had spent in the room within when she had been gayer than usual, or quieter,—when she had given him some new wound, perhaps, or when she had half-healed an old one in some mood of relenting he had not understood. \"There is no reason why I should understand any woman,\" was his simple thought. \"And why should I understand her, unless she chose to let me? She is like no other woman.\" He was quite sure of this. In his thoughts of her he found every word and act of hers worth remembering and even repeating mentally again and again for the sake of the magnetic grace which belonged only to herself, and it never once occurred to him that his own deep sympathy and tender fancy might brighten all she did. \"When she speaks,\" he thought, \"how the dullest of them stir and listen! When she moves across a room, how natural it is to turn and look at her, and be [Pg 161]interested in what she is going to do! What life I have seen her put in some poor, awkward wretch by only seating herself near him and speaking to him of some common thing! One does not know what her gift is, and whether it is well for her or ill that it was given her, but one sees it in the simplest thing she does.\" It was hard to avoid giving himself up to such thoughts as these, and when he most needed refuge from them he always sought it in the society of the professor; so there were few evenings when he did not spend an hour or so with him, and their friendship grew and waxed strong until there could scarcely have been a closer bond between them. About two weeks after Richard Amory\u0027s departure, making his call later than usual one evening, he met, coming down the steps, Mr. Arbuthnot, who stopped, with his usual civility, to shake hands with him. \"It is some weeks since we have crossed each other\u0027s paths, colonel,\" he said, scrutinizing him rather closely: \"and, in the meantime, I am afraid you have not been well.\" \"Amory called my attention to the fact a short time ago,\" responded Tredennis, \"and so did the professor. So, perhaps, there is some truth in it. I hadn\u0027t noticed it myself.\" \"You will presently, I assure you,\" said Arbuthnot, still regarding him with an air of interest. \"Perhaps Washington doesn\u0027t agree with you. I have heard of people who couldn\u0027t stand it. They usually called it malaria, but I think there was generally something\"—He checked himself somewhat abruptly, which was a rather unusual demonstration on his part, as it was his habit to weigh his speech with laudable care and deliberation. \"You are going to see the professor?\" he inquired. \"Yes,\" answered Tredennis. The idea was presenting itself to his mind that there was a suggestion of something unusual in the questioner\u0027s[Pg 162] manner; that it was not so entirely serene as was customary; that there was even a hint of some inward excitement strong enough to be repressed only by an effort. And the consciousness of this impressed itself upon him even while a flow of light talk went on, and Arbuthnot smiled at him from his upper step. \"I have been to see the professor, too,\" he was saying, \"and I felt it was something of an audacity. His invitations to me have always been of the most general nature; but I thought I would take the liberty of pretending that I fancied he regarded them seriously. He was very good to me, and exhibited wonderful presence of mind in not revealing that he was surprised to see me. I tried not to stay long enough to tire him, and he was sufficiently amiable to ask me to come again. He evidently appreciated the desolation of my circumstances.\" \"You are finding it dull?\" said Tredennis. \"Dull!\" repeated Arbuthnot. \"Yes; I think you might call it dull. The people who kindly condescend to notice me in the winter have gone away, and my dress-coat is packed in camphor. I have ceased to be useful; and, even if Fate had permitted me to be ornamental, where should I air my charms? There seems really no reason why I should exist, until next winter, when I may be useful again, and receive in return my modicum of entertainment. To be merely a superior young man in a department is not remunerative in summer, as one ceases to glean the results of one\u0027s superiority. At present I might as well be inferior, and neither dance, nor talk, nor sing, and be utterly incapacitated by nature for either carrying wraps or picking up handkerchiefs; and you cannot disport yourself at the watering-places of the rich and great on a salary of a hundred dollars a month; and you could only get your sordid \u0027month\u0027s leave,\u0027 if such a thing were possible.\" \"I—have been dull myself,\" said Tredennis, hesitantly. \"If it should ever occur to you to drop in and see a[Pg 163] fellow-sufferer,\" said Arbuthnot, \"it would relieve the monotony of my lot, at least, and might awaken in me some generous emotions.\" Tredennis looked up at him. \"It never has occurred to you so far, I see,\" was Arbuthnot\u0027s light reply to the look; \"but, if it should, don\u0027t resist the impulse. I can assure you it is a laudable one. And my humble apartment has the advantage of comparative coolness.\" When Tredennis entered the library he found the professor sitting in his usual summer seat, near the window. A newspaper lay open on his knee, but he was not reading it; he seemed, indeed, to have fallen into a reverie of a rather puzzling kind. \"Did you meet any one as you came in?\" he asked of Tredennis, as soon as they had exchanged greetings. \"I met Mr. Arbuthnot,\" Tredennis answered, \"and stopped a few moments on the steps to talk to him.\" \"He has been entertaining me for the last hour,\" said the professor, taking off his glasses and beginning to polish them. \"Now, will you tell me,\" he asked, with his quiet air of reflective inquiry into an interesting subject,—\"will you tell me why he comes to entertain me?\" \"He gave me the impression,\" answered Tredennis, \"that his object in coming was that you might entertain him, and he added that you were very good to him, and he appeared to have enjoyed his call very much.\" \"That is his way,\" responded the professor, impartially. \"And a most agreeable way it is. To be born with such a way as a natural heritage is to be a social millionnaire. And the worst of it is, that it may be a gift entirely apart from all morals and substantial virtues. Bertha has it. I don\u0027t know where she got it. Not from me, and not from her poor mother. I say it may be apart from all morals and substantial virtues. I don\u0027t say it always is. I haven\u0027t at all made up my mind what attributes go along with it in Arbuthnot\u0027s[Pg 164] case. I should like to decide. But it would be an agreeable way in a criminal of the deepest dye. It is certainly agreeable that he should in some subtle manner be able to place me in the picturesque attitude of a dignified and entertaining host. I didn\u0027t entertain him at all,\" he added, simply. \"I sat and listened to him.\" \"He is frequently well worth listening to,\" commented Tredennis. \"He was well worth listening to this evening,\" said the professor. \"And yet he was light enough. He had two or three English periodicals under his arm,—one of them was \u0027Punch,\u0027—and—and I found myself laughing quite heartily over it. And then there was something about a new comic opera, and he seemed to know the libretto by heart, and ran over an air or so on the piano. And he had been reading a new book, and was rather clever about it—in his way, of course, but still it was cleverness. And then he went to the piano again and sang a captivating little love-song very well, and, after it, got up and said good-night—and on the whole I regretted it. I liked his pictures, I liked his opera, I liked his talk of the book, and I liked his little love-song. And how should he know that an old dry-bones would like a tender little ballad and be touched by it, and pleased because his sentiment was discovered and pandered to? Oh, it is the old story. It\u0027s his way—it\u0027s the way.\" \"I am beginning to think,\" said Tredennis, slowly, \"that \u0027his way\u0027 might be called sympathy and good feeling and fine tact, if one wanted to be specially fair to him.\" The professor looked up rather quickly. \"I thought you did not like him,\" he said. Tredennis paused a moment, looking down at the carpet as if deliberating. \"I don\u0027t think I do,\" he said at length; \"but it\u0027s no fault of his—the fault lies in me. I haven\u0027t the way, and I am at a disadvantage with him. He is never at a[Pg 165] loss, and I am; he is ready-witted and self-possessed; I am slow and rigid, and I suppose it is human that I should try to imagine at times that I am at a disadvantage only because my virtues are more solid than his. They are not more solid; they are only more clumsy and less available.\" \"You don\u0027t spare yourself,\" said the professor. \"Why should I spare myself?\" said Tredennis, knitting his brows. \"After all, he never spares himself. He knows better. He would be just to me. Why should I let him place me at a disadvantage again by being unjust to him? And why should we insist that the only good qualities are those which are unornamental? It is a popular fallacy. We like to believe it. It is very easy to suspect a man of being shallow because we are sure we are deep and he is unlike us. This Arbuthnot\"— \"\u0027This Arbuthnot,\u0027\" interposed the professor, with a smile. \"It is curious enough to hear you entering upon a defence of \u0027this Arbuthnot.\u0027 You don\u0027t like him, Philip. You don\u0027t like him.\" \"I don\u0027t like myself,\" said Tredennis, \"when I am compared with him; and I don\u0027t like the tendency I discover in myself, the tendency to disparage him. I should like to be fair to him, and I find it difficult.\" \"Upon my word,\" said the professor, \"it is rather fine in you to make the effort, but\"—giving him one of the old admiring looks—\"you are always rather fine, Philip.\" \"It would be finer, sir,\" said Tredennis, coloring, \"if it were not an effort.\" \"No,\" said the professor, quietly, \"it would not be half so fine.\" And he put out his hand and let it rest upon the arm of the chair in which Tredennis sat, and so it rested as long as their talk went on. In the meantime Arbuthnot walked rather slowly down the street, quite conscious of finding it necessary to make something of an effort to compose himself. It[Pg 166] was his recognition of this necessity which had caused him to change his first intention of returning to his bachelor apartment after having made his call upon Professor Herrick. And he felt the necessity all the more strongly after his brief encounter with Colonel Tredennis. \"I will go into the park and think it over,\" he said to himself. \"I\u0027ll give myself time.\" He turned into Lafayette Park, found a quiet seat, and took out a very excellent cigar. He was not entirely surprised to see that, as he held the match to it, his hand was not as steady as usual. Tredennis had thought him a little pale. The subject of his reflections, as he smoked his cigar, was a comparatively trivial incident; taken by itself, but he had not taken it by itself, because in a flash it had connected itself with a score of others, which at the times of their occurring had borne no significance whatever to him. His visit to the professor had not been made without reasons; but they had been such reasons as, simply stated to the majority of his ordinary acquaintance, would have been received with open amazement or polite discredit, and this principally because they were such very simple reasons indeed. If such persons had been told that, finding himself without any vestige of entertainment, he had wandered in upon the professor as a last resource, or that he had wished to ask of him some trivial favor, or that he had made his call without any reason whatever, they would have felt such a state of affairs probable enough; but being informed that while sitting in the easiest of chairs, in the coolest possible negligée, reading an agreeable piece of light literature, and smoking a cigar before his open window, he had caught sight of the professor at his window, sitting with his head resting on his hand, and being struck vaguely by some air of desolateness and lassitude in the solitary old figure, had calmly laid aside book and cigar,[Pg 167] had put himself into conventional attire, and had walked across the street with no other intention than that of making the best of gifts of entertainment it was certainly not his habit to overvalue,—those to whom the explanation had been made would have taken the liberty of feeling it somewhat insufficient, and would, in nine cases out of ten, privately have provided themselves with a more complicated one, cautiously insuring themselves against imposture by rejecting at the outset the simple and unvarnished truth. Upon the whole, the visit had been a success. On entering, it is true, he found himself called upon to admire the rapidity with which the professor recovered from his surprise at seeing him; but, as he had not been deluded by any hope that his first appearance would awaken unmistakable delight, he managed to make the best of the situation. His opening remarks upon the subject of the weather were not altogether infelicitous, and then he produced his late number of \"Punch,\" and the professor laughed, and, the ice being broken, conversation flourished, and there was no further difficulty. He discovered, somewhat to his surprise, that he was in better conversational trim than usual. \"It is a delusive condition to be in,\" he explained to the professor; \"but experience has taught me not to be taken in by it and expect future development. It won\u0027t continue, as you no doubt suspect. It is the result of entire social stagnation for several weeks. I am merely letting off all my fireworks at once, inspired to the improvidence by your presence. I am a poor creature, as you know; but even a poor creature is likely to suffer from an idea a day. The mental accumulations of this summer, carefully economized, will support me in penury during the entire ensuing season. I only conjure you not to betray me when you hear me repeat the same things by instalments at Mrs. Amory\u0027s evenings.\" And, saying it, he saw the professor\u0027s face change in some subtle way as he looked at him. What there was[Pg 168] in this look and change to make him conscious of an inward start he could not have told. It was the merest lifting of the lids, combined with an almost imperceptible movement of the muscles about the mouth; and yet he found it difficult to avoid pausing for a moment. But he accomplished the feat, and felt he had reason to be rather proud of it. \"Though what there is to startle him in my mention of Mrs. Amory\u0027s evenings,\" he reflected, \"it would require an intellect to explain.\" Being somewhat given to finding entertainment in quiet speculation upon passing events, he would doubtless have given some attention to the incident, even if it had remained a solitary unexplained and mystifying trifle. But it was not left to stand alone in his mind. It was not fifteen minutes before, in drawing his handkerchief from his breast-pocket, he accidentally drew forth with it a letter, which fell upon the newspaper lying upon the professor\u0027s lap, and for a moment rested there with the address upward. And the instant he glanced from the pretty feminine envelope to the professor\u0027s face Arbuthnot recognized the fact that something altogether unexpected had occurred again. As he had looked from the envelope to the professor, so the professor looked from the envelope to him. Then he picked the letter up and returned it. \"It is a letter,\" Arbuthnot began,—\"a letter\"—and paused ignominiously. \"Yes,\" said the professor, as if he had lost something of his own gentle self-possession. \"I see it is a letter.\" It was not a happy remark, nor did Arbuthnot feel his own next effort a particularly successful one. \"It is a letter from Mrs. Amory,\" he said. \"She is kind enough to write to me occasionally.\" \"Yes,\" responded the professor. \"I saw that it was from Bertha. Her hand is easily recognized.\" \"It is an unusual hand,\" said Arbuthnot. \"And her letters are very like herself. When it occurs to her to[Pg 169] remember me—which doesn\u0027t happen as frequently as I could wish—I consider myself fortunate. She writes as she talks, and very few people do that.\" He ended with a greater degree of composure than he had begun with, but to his surprise he felt that his pulses had quickened, and that there had risen to his face a touch of warmth suggestive of some increase of color, and he did not enjoy the sensation. He began to open the letter. \"Shall I\"—he said, and then suddenly stopped. He knew why he had stopped, but the professor did not, and to make the pause and return the letter to its envelope and its place in his pocket without an explanation required something like hardihood. \"She is well, and seems to be taking advantage of the opportunity to rest,\" he said, and picked up his \"Punch\" again, returning to his half-finished comment upon its cartoon as if no interruption had taken place. As he sat on his seat in the park, apparently given up to undivided enjoyment of his cigar, his mind was filled with a tumult of thought. He had not been under the influence of such mental excitement for years. Suddenly he found himself confronting a revelation perfectly astounding to him. \"And so I am the man!\" he said, at last. \"I am the man!\" He took his cigar out of his mouth and looked at the end of it with an air of deliberate reflection, as is the masculine habit. \"It doesn\u0027t say much for me,\" he added, \"that I never once suspected it—not once.\" Then he replaced his cigar, with something like a sigh. \"We are a blind lot,\" he said. He did not feel the situation a pleasant one; there were circumstances under which he would have resented it with a vigor and happy ingenuity of resource which would have stood him in good stead; but there was no[Pg 170] resentment in his present mood. From the moment the truth had dawned upon him, he had treated it without even the most indirect reference to his own very natural feelings, and there had been more sacrifice of himself and his own peculiarities in his action when he had returned the letter to his pocket than even he himself realized. \"It was not the letter to show him,\" was his thought. \"She does not know how much she tells me. He would have understood it as I do.\" He went over a good deal of ground mentally as he sat in the deepening dusk, and he thought clearly and dispassionately, as was his habit when he allowed himself to think at all. By the time he had arrived at his conclusions it was quite dark. Then he threw the end of his last cigar away and arose, and there was no denying that he was pale still, and wore a curiously intense expression. \"If there is one thing neither man nor devil can put a stop to,\" he said, \"it is an experience such as that. It will go on to one of two ends,—it will kill her, or she will kill it. The wider of the mark they shoot, the easier for her; and as for me,\" he added, with a rather faint and dreary smile, \"perhaps it suits me well enough to be merely an alleviating circumstance. It\u0027s all I\u0027m good for. Let them think as they please.\" And he brushed an atom of cigar-ash from his sleeve with his rather too finely feminine hand, and walked away.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2698/74176.html","bookId":1460,"book":{"id":1460,"title":"Through One Administration","description":"简介： Eight years before the Administration rendered important by the series of events and incidents which form the present story, there had come to Washington, on a farewell visit to a distant relative with whom he was rather a favorite, a young officer w...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2698","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:25:09 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:25:09 AM"}}
