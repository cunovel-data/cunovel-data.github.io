{"id":35255,"no":7,"title":"CHAPTER VII.","content":"To Tredennis the next three months were full of event. It was mostly quiet event, and yet, as day followed day, he was conscious that, in each twenty-four hours, he lived through some new mental experience which left its mark upon him. The first two weeks seemed to make his old regular, routine-governed life a thing of the far past, from which he was entirely separated by a gulf which it would be impossible to recross. He awakened to a recognition of this at the end of the second week, and told himself that the feeling was due to the complete novelty of his surroundings and their natural influences upon him. He found himself placed among people whose lives, ambitions, and interests were all new to him, and of a kind with which he had never before been thrown into close contact for a length of time sufficient to allow of analysis. In his first visit to Washington he had regarded its peculiarities merely as an amateur and a visitor; now he saw and studied them from a different stand-point. The public buildings were no longer mere edifices in his eyes, but developed into tremendous communities, regulated by a tremendous system for which there could be no medium or indefinite standing, but which must either be a tremendous credit or a tremendous discredit to itself and the power it represented. The human side of the place grew and impressed itself upon him. He began to feel the full significance of the stream of humanity which ebbed and flowed to and from these buildings at stated hours in the day. After a few afternoon walks on the Avenue he could recognize many a face that passed him, and comprehend something of what it typified. He could single out the young woman who[Pg 67] supported her family upon her salary, and the young woman who bought her ribbons with it; the widow whose pay fed half-a-dozen children, and the husband whose earnings were appropriated by a wife of fashionable aspirations; the man of broken career, whose wasted ambitions and frustrated purposes were buried in the monotonous routine of a Government clerkship, and who asked and hoped for no greater boon than to be permitted to hold his place through as much of the future as remained to him. It was an orderly and respectably dressed crowd, as a rule; but there was many a sad face to be seen in it, and many an anxious and disappointed one. It never failed to interest Tredennis, and he took his afternoon walk so often at the same hour that the passers-by began to know his tall, soldierly figure and sunbrowned face, and rather expected to encounter them; and when the newspapers had referred to him on a dozen occasions or so, there were not a few who recognized him, and pointed him out to each other as something of a celebrity and a hero, and so worth seeing. \\n\\n \\n\\n This general knowledge which people seemed to have of one another was one thing which struck him as peculiarly local. It was the rule, and not the exception, that in walking out he met persons he knew or knew of, and he found it at no time difficult to discover the names and positions of those who attracted his attention. Almost all noticeable and numerous unnoticeable persons were to be distinguished in some way from their fellows. The dark, sinewy man he observed standing on the steps of a certain family hotel was a noted New England senator; his companion was the head of an important department; the man who stood near was the private secretary of the President, or the editor of one of the dailies, or a man with a much-discussed claim against the Government; the handsome woman whose carriage drew up before a fashionable millinery establishment was the wife of a foreign diplomat, or of a well-known[Pg 68] politician, or of a member of the Cabinet; the woman who crossed her path as she got out was a celebrated female suffragist, or female physician, or lawyer, or perhaps that much-talked-of will-o\u0027-the-wisp, a female lobbyist; and eight persons out of every ten passing them knew their names and not a little of their private history. So much was crowded within a comparatively limited radius that it was not easy for any person or thing worthy of note to be lost or hidden from the public eye. \\n\\n \\n\\n By the most natural gradations Tredennis found the whole tenor of his existence changed in this atmosphere. His fixed habits of life gave way before the influences surrounding him. \\n\\n \\n\\n One of the most subtle of these influences was that of his intimacy with the members of the Amory household, which grew as he had not at all anticipated that it would. He had thought of the acquaintance in the first place as one not likely to ripen into anything beyond its rather conventional significance. Perhaps, on the whole, he had been content to let it rest as it was, feeling only half-consciously that he should be in a quieter frame of mind and less liable to vague pangs and disappointments. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is all different,\" he had said to himself. \"And it is all over. It is better that it should remain as it is.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But after his first visit Richard did not choose to lose sight of him. It was his fancy to seek him out and make much of and take possession of him, with an amiability and frank persistence in the chase which were at once complimentary and engaging. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Look here!\" he would say, having followed him up to reproach him. \"You don\u0027t suppose we intend to be treated in this manner? We won\u0027t hear of it. We want you. Your stalwart solidity is what we have been needing to give us weight and balance. Only yesterday Bertha was holding you up to Arbuthnot as a model[Pg 69] of steadfastness of purpose. We thought we were going to see you every other day, at least, and you have not been near us for a week. Bertha wonders what we have been guilty of.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And then he would be carried up to luncheon or dinner, or to spend the evening; and each visit resulted in another and another, until it gradually became the most natural thing in the world that he should drop in at odd hours, because it seemed that he was always expected, and he appeared to have a place among them. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do you know what we shall do with you if you remain here a year?\" Bertha had said to him at the outset. \"We shall domesticate you. We not only domesticated Mr. Arbuthnot, but we appropriated him. We feel that we have invested largely in him, and that he ought to respect our rights and pay interest. Sometimes I wonder how he likes it, and just now it occurs to me to wonder how you would like it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The question is,\" Tredennis answered, \"how you would like it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He was always conscious of a silent distaste for being compared to Mr. Arbuthnot, and he was also always conscious of the youthful weakness of the feeling. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is the kind of thing which belongs to a younger man,\" he used to say to himself. \"It is arrant folly; and yet I am not fond of the fellow.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But, as Bertha had predicted, he became in a manner domesticated in the household. Perhaps the truth was that his natural tendency was toward the comfort and easy communion of home-life. He was a little surprised to find himself develop a strong fancy for children. He had never been averse to them, but he had known nothing of them, and had never suspected himself of any definite disposition to fondness for them. After he had watched Bertha\u0027s during a few visits he began to like them, and to be oddly interested in their sayings and doings. He discovered Jack to be a decidedly sturdy[Pg 70] and masculine little fellow, with rather more than his share of physical strength and beauty; and, making amicable advances toward him, was met half-way with a fearless readiness which was very attractive. Then he made friends with Janey, and found himself still more interested. Her childish femininity was even better worth studying than Jack\u0027s miniature manhood. She was a small, gentle creature, with clinging hands and much faith, but also with a delightful sense of infantile dignity, and the friendship which established itself between them was a very absorbing sentiment. It was not long before it became an understood thing among the juvenile portion of the establishment that Tredennis was to be counted among the spoils. His incoming was greeted with rapture, his outgoing was regarded as a species of calamity only to be borne because it was unavoidable. He could tell stories of Indians and bears, and on more than one occasion was decoyed into the nursery, and found to be not entirely without resources in the matter of building forts with blocks, and defending them against aboriginal warriors with tin soldiers. His own sense of enjoyment of the discovery of these accomplishments in himself filled him with a whimsical pleasure. He began to carry toys in his pockets, and became a connoisseur of such dainties as were considered harmless to the juvenile constitution; and after having been reproved by Janey, on two or three occasions, for the severity of his air, he began also to have a care that the expression of his countenance should be less serious and more likely to win the approval of innocent small creatures, who considered gravity uncalled for and mysterious. At first he had seemed to learn but little of Bertha herself, notwithstanding that a day seldom passed without their meeting, and there were times when he fancied he had determined that there was but little to learn. The gayeties of the season over, she announced her intention of resting; and her manner of accomplishing this end was to inaugurate a series of small [Pg 71]festivities, with a result of occupying each day until midnight. She gave small, informal dinners, suppers, and teas to the favored few who would be most likely to enjoy and find them exhilarating, and, when she did not give a dinner or tea, her evenings were bestowed upon Arbuthnot and half a dozen of the inner circle, whose habit it was to drop in and talk politics, literature, or entertaining nonsense. \\n\\n \\n\\n At such times it was not at all unusual for the professor to ramble in at about nine o\u0027clock, and profess to partake of the cup of tea Bertha offered him, and which he invariably left more than half full upon the small table by his chair. His old tender interest in her had not lessened in degree, Tredennis noticed, after seeing them together on two or three occasions, but it had altered in kind. Sometimes the look of curious speculation returned to his eyes, but oftener they expressed a patient, kindly watchfulness. It was not long before Tredennis began to observe that this quietly watchful look generally showed itself when Arbuthnot was present. The first time that he felt the full force of the truth of this was one evening when there had been only two or three callers, who had remained but a short time, going away early, and leaving no one in the parlors but himself, the professor, and Arbuthnot. \\n\\n \\n\\n Arbuthnot had come in later than usual, and had appeared to be in an unusual mood. He was pale when he entered, and had no jesting speech to make. He took his seat by Bertha, and replied to her remarks with but little of his customary animation, now and then lapsing into silence as if he had forgotten his surroundings. Bertha seemed inclined to let his humor pass without notice, as if it was not exactly a new experience; but Richard commented upon it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Something has gone wrong,\" he said. \"What is it, Larry?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nothing has gone wrong,\" Arbuthnot answered, with a short, cheerless laugh. \"I have seen a ghost, that is all.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 72] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A ghost!\" said Bertha, in a low voice, and then sat silent, guarding her face from the fire with her favorite peacock-feather screen. \\n\\n \\n\\n The professor began to stir his tea round and round, which exercise was his customary assistance to reflection or debate. He glanced at the peacock-feather screen, and then at Arbuthnot. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A ghost is always an interesting scientific conundrum,\" he observed. \"What form did it take?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Arbuthnot laughed his short, cheerless laugh again. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It took the form of a sanguine young man from the West,\" he said, \"who has just come into a twelve-hundred-dollar clerkship, and feels that unending vistas of fortune lie before him. He was in such good spirits about it that I rather lost my hold on myself, and said things I might as well have left unsaid.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What did you say?\" Richard asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I told him that if he had money enough left to buy a return ticket home he had better buy one; and that, if he had not, I would lend it to him. I told him that at his age it wasn\u0027t a bad idea for a man to devote his time to establishing himself in some career he could depend on; and that, in default of having the energy to do that, he might reflect on the alternative of blowing his brains out as a preparation for a peaceful old age. And I told him that I had seen young fellows like himself before, and that the end had been for them what it would be for him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well?\" said Richard, as he had stopped. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It wasn\u0027t any use,\" he answered. \"I knew it would not be when I began. I simply made a spectacle of myself in a quiet way to no purpose, and as a result I am uncomfortable. It was all nonsense, but he reminded me\"— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of what?\" said Richard, since he had paused again. \\n\\n \\n\\n A peculiar expression crossed his face. Tredennis saw him glance at the peacock-feather screen, and as quickly glance away. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 73] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of—a young fellow of his age I—used to know,\" he answered. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What was his story?\" inquired Richard, with his usual desire for information. \"Where is he now?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Dead,\" said Arbuthnot; and, singularly enough, he half laughed again as he tossed his cigar into the grate and went to the piano. \\n\\n \\n\\n He began to sing in a rather low voice, and while he sang the rest listened. When he referred to his musical efforts it was his habit to treat them as but trivial performances; but he allowed them to lose none of their effectiveness through lack of care and culture. He knew wherein his power lay, and used it well. To-night, for some reason, this power was at its strongest, and, as he sang song after song, even Tredennis was compelled to acknowledge that, if it was his object to produce an emotional effect, he was in a fair way to succeed. \\n\\n \\n\\n Richard threw himself upon a sofa and gave himself up to him with characteristic readiness to be moved, the professor stirred his tea slowly and mechanically, and Bertha sat still in the shadow of her screen. But it was she who moved first. In the midst of one of the songs she left her seat, slowly crossed the room to the piano, and stood near it, leaning against the dark wall, her slight white figure thrown into strong relief, her hands—one of them still holding the peacock-feather screen—fallen at her sides, her eyes resting on Arbuthnot\u0027s averted face. It seemed to Tredennis that she had moved in obedience to some impulse of whose power she was scarcely conscious. He saw that she also was pale, and looked worn with fatigue, and he was filled, as he had been more than once before, with secret resentment of the fact that no one but himself appeared to notice that she had changed even within the last month. \\n\\n \\n\\n Arbuthnot continued playing. It was evident that she had not intended to distract his attention when she[Pg 74] approached him, and he did not look at or speak to her. As she stood listening, it seemed as if she had forgotten everything but the influence his voice exerted over her for the time being, and that she allowed it to carry her whither it would. Something in the soft, absorbed expression of her face reminded Tredennis vaguely of the look she had worn when she turned to brood over his words on the night when he had felt nearest to her. He was thinking this when a movement from the professor attracted his attention,—a jingling of the teaspoon, a little crash, an exclamation of dismay and confusion, and the little stand had mysteriously been overturned, and the professor was ruefully bending down to pick up the fragments of his small cup and saucer. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My dear child!\" he said to Bertha, who had started forward to his rescue, \"what a stupid old Vandal I am, and what an insecure little table to betray me with—and in the midst of Schubert\u0027s \u0027Serenade,\u0027 too, which Mr. Arbuthnot was giving us in his most effective manner! Suppose you take me up into the nursery, as an example to the children, while you dry my coat.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He went out of the room with her, his hand upon her shoulder, and Arbuthnot left the piano, and returned to the fire. The spell had been broken with the cup and saucer, and the \"Serenade\" remained unfinished. He produced a fresh cigar,—which luxury was one of many accorded him in the household,—lighted it, and, rather to Tredennis\u0027 surprise, resumed his conversation as if there had been no pause in it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The fellow will be an annoyance to me every day of his life,\" he said, faint lines showing themselves upon his forehead in spite of the half-smile which was meant to deprive them of their significance. \"I know that, confound him! He is in my room, and I shall have the benefit of every change in him, and it will be a grind—there\u0027s no denying that it will be a grind.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 75] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I should like to know,\" said Tredennis, \"what the changes will be.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The changes will depend upon the kind of fellow he chances to be,\" said Arbuthnot. \"There are two varieties. If there is a good deal in him he will begin by being hopeful and working hard. He will think that he may make himself of value in his position and create a sort of career for himself. He will do more than is required of him, and neglect nothing. He will keep his eyes open and make friends of the men about him. He will do that for a few months, and then, suddenly, and for no fault whatever, one of these friends will be dropped out. Knowing the man to be as faithful as himself, it will be a shock to him, and he will get anxious, and worry over it. He will see him stranded without resources, struggling to regain his place or get another, treated with amiable tolerance when he is not buffeted, snubbed, and put off. He will see him hanging about day after day, growing shabbier, more careworn, more desperate, until he disappears and is heard of no more, and everybody is rather relieved than not. He may have been a family man, with a wife and half-a-dozen children all living decently on his salary. Somebody else wanted his place and got it, not because of superior fitness for it, but because the opposing influence was stronger than his. The new man will go through the same experience when his turn comes—that is all. Well, my friend will see this and be anxious, and ask questions and find out that his chances are just the same—no more and no less. He will try not to believe it, being young enough to be betrayed into the folly, and he will work harder than ever, and get over his blow a little until he sees the same thing happen again and again. Then he will begin to lose some of his good spirits; he will be a trifle irritable at times, and lines will show themselves on his face, and he won\u0027t be so young. When he writes to the girl he is in love with,—I saw a letter addressed to some young woman[Pg 76] out West, lying on his desk to-day,—she will notice a change in him, and the change will reveal itself more in each letter; but he will hang on and grind away, and each election will be a nightmare to him. But he will grind away. And, then, at last\"— \\n\\n \\n\\n He stopped and made a light, rather graceful gesture with his fingers. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What then?\" demanded Tredennis, with manifest impatience. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There will be a new administration, and, if he struggles through, it will be worse for him than if he were dropped, as in that case he throws away another four years of his life and all the chances for a future they might hold if he were free to avail himself of them.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Tredennis stood up, looking very large under the influence of the feeling which disturbed him. Arbuthnot himself was not entirely unimpressed by his quick movement and the energy it expressed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You treat the matter coolly,\" he exclaimed, as he rose. \\n\\n \\n\\n Arbuthnot turned his attention to his cigar. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes,\" he replied. \"I treat it coolly. If I treated it warmly or hotly the effect produced would be about the same. My influence upon civil service is just what it might be expected to be, and no more. Its weight is easily carried.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I beg your pardon,\" said Tredennis, feeling the justice and adroitness of the speech. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not at all,\" Arbuthnot answered. \"It is not necessary. It makes you lose your hold on yourself to be brought face to face with the thing. It is quite natural. It has had the same effect on me, and I am a cold-blooded fellow, and a frivolous fellow into the bargain.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have never thought of the matter before,\" said Tredennis, disturbedly. \"I feel as if my indifference is something to be ashamed of.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If you give your attention as a duty to such subjects,\"[Pg 77] was Arbuthnot\u0027s response, \"you will be kept actively employed. If you take my advice, you will let them alone.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The trouble is,\" said Tredennis, \"that every one seems to let them alone.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Richard regarded him, from his place on the sofa-cushions, delightedly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Here\u0027s an example for you, Larry,\" he said. \"Profit by him. Everything is an object to him,—everything is worth while. He is an example to us all. Let us all profit by him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, he began right,\" laughed Arbuthnot. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He began where you began,\" returned Richard. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I?\" was the airy answer; \"I never began at all. That is my little difficulty. I am the other one. I told you there was another one. I represent him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Tredennis regarded him steadily. For the first time in the course of their acquaintance he began to suspect him. His manner was too light altogether, and the odd shade which had fallen upon his eyes before during the evening showed itself again. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Let us hear about the other one,\" he said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He is easily disposed of,\" was the answer. \"There was nothing of him at the outset. He came to his place without an object. He liked the idea of living in Washington, and of spending his salary. We will say he was a rather well-looking young fellow, and could dance and sing a little, and talk decently well. He had no responsibilities, and never thought of the future. His salary clothed him, and allowed him little luxuries and ordinary pleasures. He spent it when he had it, and made debt when it was gone. Being presentable, he was invited out, and made himself useful and entertaining in a small way. When he thought of the possibilities of his career being brought suddenly to a close, he was uncomfortable, so he preferred not to think of it. It is not a pleasant thing to reflect that a man has about ten years in which to begin life, and that[Pg 78] after that he is ending it; but it is true. What he does from twenty to thirty he will be likely to find he must abide by from thirty to seventy, if he lives that long. This man, like the better one, has thrown away the years in which he might have been preparing himself to end decently. When they are gone he has nothing to show for them, and less than nothing. He is the feather upon the current, and when all is over for him he is whirled out of sight and forgotten with the rest. And, perhaps, if he had felt there was anything to be gained by his being a steady, respectable fellow, he might have settled down into one.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He got up suddenly, with a gesture as if he would shake himself free of his mood. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Here,\" he said, \"I\u0027m going! It is quite time. It\u0027s all nonsense talking it over. It is the old story. I have made myself uncomfortable for nothing. Confound you, Dick, why did you let me begin? Say good-night to the professor and Mrs. Amory for me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Come back!\" called Richard. \"Bertha will want to hear the rest of the \u0027Serenade\u0027 when she comes down.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The \u0027Serenade\u0027!\" he said, derisively. \"No, thank you. You have had enough of me, and I have had too much of myself.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He passed into the hall just as the professor descended from the nursery and through the open door. Tredennis heard what they said to each other. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You did not finish the \u0027Serenade,\u0027\" said the professor. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No,\" was the reply; \"and I am afraid you were resigned to it, Professor.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You were singing it very well, and with great effect,\" the professor responded, amicably. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You are very kind to say so,\" Arbuthnot answered. \"Good-night, sir.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Good-night,\" replied the professor, as he entered the parlor. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 79] \\n\\n \\n\\n As he did so Tredennis heard the sound of feet upon the stairs, and caught a glimpse of Bertha\u0027s white figure as she came down. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You are not going?\" he heard her say. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She had reached the last step by this time, and stood with her hand resting upon the balustrade, and she was paler than she had been before. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I—\" she began—\"I wanted to talk to you. What is it, Larry?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Tredennis had never heard her call him by his first name before; and he felt, with a keenness which startled him, the soft naturalness with which it fell from her lips. \\n\\n \\n\\n Arbuthnot\u0027s voice itself had altered when he answered her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is nothing,\" he said, \"but that I am not exactly in a presentable humor, and I want to go and conceal myself. It is the best thing I can do. Good-night.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He held out his hand, touched hers lightly, and then turned away, and the door opened and closed after him, and Bertha came into the parlor, moving slowly, as if she felt tired. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2698/74168.html","bookId":1460,"book":{"id":1460,"title":"Through One Administration","description":"简介： Eight years before the Administration rendered important by the series of events and incidents which form the present story, there had come to Washington, on a farewell visit to a distant relative with whom he was rather a favorite, a young officer w...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2698","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:25:09 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:25:09 AM"}}
