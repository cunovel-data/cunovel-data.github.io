{"id":35259,"no":11,"title":"CHAPTER XI.","content":"It was two weeks after this that Arbuthnot, sauntering down the avenue in a leisurely manner, on his way from his office, and having a fancy to stroll through Lafayette Park, which was looking its best in its spring bravery and bloom, on entering the iron gate-way found his attention attracted by the large figure of Colonel Tredennis, who was approaching him from the opposite direction, walking slowly and appearing deeply abstracted. It cannot be said that Mr. Arbuthnot felt any special delight in the prospective encounter. He had not felt that he had advanced greatly in Colonel Tredennis\u0027 good opinion, and had, it must be confessed, resigned himself to that unfortunate condition of affairs without making any particular effort to remedy it,—his private impression being that the result would scarcely be likely to pay for the exertion, taking into consideration the fact that he was constitutionally averse to exertion. \n \n \"Why,\" he had said to Bertha, \"should I waste my vital energies in endeavoring to persuade a man that I am what he wants, when perhaps I am not? There are scores of people who will naturally please him better than I do, and there are people enough who please me better than he does. Let him take his choice,—and it is easy enough to see that I am not his choice.\" \n \n \"What is he thinking of now, I wonder?\" he said, a vague plan for turning into another walk flitting through his mind. \"Are his friends, the Piutes, on the war-path and actively engaged in dissecting agents, or is he simply out of humor? He is not thinking of where he is going. He will walk over that nursemaid and obliterate the twins—yes, I thought so.\" \n \n [Pg 124] \n \n The colonel had verified his prophecy, and, aroused from his reverie by the devastation he had caused, he came to a stand-still with a perplexed and distressed countenance. \n \n \"I beg your pardon,\" Arbuthnot heard him say, in his great, deep voice. \"I hope I did not hurt you. I had forgotten where I was.\" And he stooped and set the nearest twin on its feet on the grass and then did the same thing for the other, upon which both stood and stared at him, and, not being hurt at all, having merely rolled over on the sod, were in sufficiently good spirits to regard with interest the fact that he was fumbling in his coat-pocket for something. \n \n The article in question was a package of bonbons, which he produced and gave to the nearest toddler. \n \n \"Here!\" he said. \"I bought these for another little girl, but I can get some more. They are all right,\" he added, turning to the mulatto girl, whose admiration of his martial bearing revealed itself in a most lenient grin,—\"they won\u0027t hurt them. They can eat them all without being harmed.\" \n \n And then he turned away, and in doing so caught sight of Arbuthnot, and, somewhat to the surprise of the latter, advanced toward him at once with the evident intention of joining him. \n \n \"It is rather a curious thing that I should meet you here,\" he said. \"I was thinking of you when I met with the catastrophe you saw just now. Do you often go home this way?\" \n \n \"Not very often,\" Arbuthnot replied. \"Sometimes, when things look as they do now,\" with a gesture indicating the brilliant verdure. \n \n \"Everything looks very fresh and luxuriant,\" said Tredennis. \"The season is unusually far advanced, I suppose. It is sometimes a great deal too warm to be pleasant.\" \n \n \"It will be decidedly warmer every day,\" said Arbuthnot. \"We shall have a trying summer. The[Pg 125] President is going out to the Soldiers\u0027 Home next week—which is earlier than usual. There are only two or three of the senators\u0027 families left in the city. The exodus began weeks ago.\" \n \n \"Such weather as we have had the last few days,\" said the colonel, with his slight frown, \"must be very exhausting to those who are not strong, and who have gone through a gay winter.\" \n \n \"The best thing such people can do,\" responded Arbuthnot, dryly, \"is to make their way to the mountains or the sea as soon as possible. Most of them do.\" \n \n Tredennis\u0027 reply was characteristically abrupt. \n \n \"Mrs. Amory does not,\" he said. \n \n \"No,\" answered Arbuthnot, and he looked at the end of his cigar as if he saw nothing else. \n \n \"Why doesn\u0027t she?\" demanded Tredennis. \n \n \"She ought to,\" said Arbuthnot, with calm adroitness. \n \n \"Ought to!\" Tredennis repeated. \"She should have gone months ago. She—she is actually ill. Why in heaven\u0027s name does she stay? She told me two weeks since that she was going to Fortress Monroe, or some such place.\" \n \n \"She had better go to a New England farm-house, and wear a muslin gown and swing in a hammock,\" said Arbuthnot. \n \n \"You see that as well, do you?\" said the colonel. \"Why don\u0027t you tell her so?\" and having said it, seemed to pull himself up suddenly, as if he felt he had been unconsciously impetuous. \n \n Arbuthnot laughed. \n \n His smile had died completely away, however, when he gave his side glance at his companion\u0027s face a moment later. \n \n \"She was quite serious in her intention of going away two weeks ago,\" he said. \"She told me so; nothing but Richard\u0027s dinner-party prevented her departure in the first place.\" \n \n He spoke in an entirely non-committal tone, but[Pg 126] there was a touch of interest in his quiet glance at Tredennis. \n \n \"You dined there with Planefield and the rest, didn\u0027t you?\" he added. \n \n \"Yes.\" \n \n \"I didn\u0027t. Richard was kind enough to invite me, but I should only have been in the way.\" He paused an instant, and then added, without any change of tone or manner, \"I know nothing of the Westoria lands.\" \n \n \"Was it necessary that you should?\" said Tredennis. \"I did not.\" \n \n \"Oh,\" Arbuthnot answered, \"I knew they would discuss them, and the bill, as it pleases Amory to be interested in them just now.\" \n \n \"I remember that the matter was referred to several times,\" said Tredennis; \"even Mrs. Amory seemed to know a good deal of it.\" \n \n \"A good deal!\" said Arbuthnot. \"In favor of the bill?\" \n \n \"Yes,\" Tredennis answered. \"She had been reading up, it appeared. She said some very good things about it—in a laughing way. Why does she waste her time and strength on such folly?\" he added, hotly. \"Why—why is she allowed to do it?\" \n \n \"The New England farm would be better for her just now,\" said Arbuthnot—again adroitly. \n \n \"Why should Amory waste his time upon it?\" the colonel went on; \"though that is his affair, of course, and not mine!\" \n \n They had reached the gate by this time, but they did not pass through it. Finding themselves near it, they turned—as if by mutual consent, and yet without speaking of doing so—into the walk nearest them. \n \n It was after taking a few steps in silence down this path, that Colonel Tredennis spoke again, abruptly: \n \n \"When I was thinking of you just before we met,\" he said, \"I was thinking of you in connection with—with the Amorys.\" \n \n [Pg 127] \n \n He knew the statement had a blunt enough sound, and his recognition of it irritated him, but he was beginning to be accustomed to his own bluntness of statement, and, at any rate, this led him to the point he meant to reach. \n \n Arbuthnot\u0027s reply was characteristic. It was not blunt at all, and had an air of simple directness, which was the result not only of a most creditable tact and far-sightedness, but of more private good feeling and sincerity than he was usually credited with. \n \n \"I am always glad to be thought of in connection with the Amorys,\" he said. \"And I am glad that it is perfectly natural that I should be connected with them in the minds of their friends. There has been a very close connection between us for several years, and I hope they have found as much pleasure in it as I have.\" \n \n Tredennis recognized the tact even if he was not aware of the good feeling and far-sightedness. The obstacles had been removed from his path, and the conversation had received an air of unconstrained naturalness, which would make it easier for him to go on. \n \n \"Then,\" he said, \"there will be no need to explain what I mean by saying that I was thinking specially of your interest in Mrs. Amory herself—and your influence over her.\" \n \n \"I wish my influence over her was as strong as my interest in her,\" was his companion\u0027s reply. \"My interest in her is a sincere enough feeling, and a deep one. There is every reason why it should be.\" \n \n \"I,\"—began the colonel,—\"I\"—And then he stopped. \n \n \"Your interest in her,\" Arbuthnot went on, seeming to enjoy his cigar very much, \"is even a more natural feeling than mine—though I scarcely think it can be stronger. It is not a matter of relationship so much,—as a rule, relationship does not amount to a great deal,—but the fact that you knew her as a girl, and feel toward the professor as you do, must give her a distinct place in your mind.\" \n \n [Pg 128] \n \n \"It is a feeling,\" said Tredennis, \"which disturbs me when I see that she is in actual danger through her own want of care for herself. Are women always so reckless? Is it a Washington fashion? Why should she forget that her children need her care, if she does not choose to think of herself? Is that a Washington fashion, too?\" \n \n \"You were thinking,\" said Arbuthnot, \"and flattering me in doing it, that what I might say to her on the necessity of leaving the city might have some little effect?\" \n \n \"Yes,\" Tredennis answered. \"And if not upon herself, upon Amory. He is always ready to listen to you.\" \n \n Arbuthnot was silent for some moments. He was following a certain train of thought closely and rapidly, but his expression did not betray him at all. \n \n \"She would have gone two weeks ago,\" he said quietly next, \"if it had not been for Richard\u0027s engagements with Planefield and the rest. He has had them at his house two or three times since then, and they have made little parties to Mount Vernon and Arlington and Great Falls. Planefield is a lady\u0027s man, and he finds Mrs. Amory very charming.\" \n \n \"What!\" exclaimed Tredennis, with intolerant haughtiness,—\"that coarse fellow?\" \n \n \"He isn\u0027t a nice fellow,\" said Arbuthnot, \"but he won\u0027t show his worst side to her—any more than he can help. He is a very powerful fellow, they say.\" \n \n Here he stopped. They had reached their gate-way again. \n \n \"I\u0027ll do what I can,\" he said. \"It won\u0027t be much, perhaps; but I will do what I can. I fully appreciate the confidence you showed in speaking to me.\" \n \n \"I fully appreciate the manner in which you listened to what I had to say,\" said Tredennis. \n \n And, somewhat to Arbuthnot\u0027s surprise, he held out his hand to him. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2698/74172.html","bookId":1460,"book":{"id":1460,"title":"Through One Administration","description":"简介： Eight years before the Administration rendered important by the series of events and incidents which form the present story, there had come to Washington, on a farewell visit to a distant relative with whom he was rather a favorite, a young officer w...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2698","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:25:09 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:25:09 AM"}}
