{"id":35272,"no":24,"title":"CHAPTER XXIV.","content":"They moved away and went to the supper-room themselves, leaving Tredennis to his reflections. What these were he scarcely knew himself for a few seconds. The murmur of voices and passing to and fro confused him. For half an hour of quiet in some friendly corner, where none could see his face, he felt that he would have given a year or so of his life—perhaps a greater number of years than a happier man would have been willing to part with. It was of Bertha these people had been speaking—of Bertha, and it was Bertha he could see through the open doors of the supper-room, eating ices, listening to compliment and laughter and jest! It was Planefield who was holding her flowers, and the man who had just picked up her fan was one of his friends; in two or three others near her, Tredennis recognized his associates: it seemed as if the ground had been ceded to them by those who had at first formed her little court. Tredennis was seized with a wild desire to make his way into their midst, take her hand in his arm, and compel her to come away—to leave them all, to let him take her home—to safety and honor and her children. He was so filled with the absurd impulse that he took half a step forward, stopping and smiling bitterly, when he realized what he was prompted to do. \"How she would like it,\" he thought, \"and like me for doing it; and what a paragraph it would make for the society column!\" Incidents which had occurred within the last few weeks came back to him with a significance they had never before borne. Speeches and moods of Richard\u0027s, things he had done, occasional unconscious displays of eagerness to please Planefield and cultivate him, his[Pg 314] manner toward Bertha, and certain touches of uneasiness when she was not at her best. From the first the colonel had not felt himself as entirely prepossessed by this amiable and charming young man as he desired to be, and he had been compelled to admit that he was not always pleased by his gay good-humor, evanescent enthusiasms, and by his happy, irresponsible fashion of looking at life. When he had at last made this confession to himself he had not shrunk from giving himself an explanation of the matter, from which a nature more sparing of itself would have flinched. He had said that his prejudice was one to blush at and conquer by persistent effort, and he had done his sternly honest best to subdue it. But he had not succeeded as he had hoped he should. When he fancied he was making progress and learning to be fair, some trifle continually occurred which made itself an obstacle in his path. He saw things he did not wish to see, and heard things he did not wish to hear,—little things which made him doubt and ponder, and which somehow he could not shake off, even when he tried to forget them and persuade himself that, after all, they were of slight significance. And as he had seen more of the gay good-humor and readiness to be moved, his first shadowy feeling had assumed more definite form. He had found himself confronted by a distrust which grew upon him; he had met the young man\u0027s smiling eyes with a sense of being repelled by their very candor and brightness; he had learned that they were not so candid as they seemed, and that his boyish frankness was not always to be relied upon. He had discovered that he was ready to make a promise and forget it; that his impressionable mind could shift itself and change its color, and that somehow its quickness of action had a fashion of invariably tending toward the accomplishment of some personal end,—a mere vagary or graceful whim, perhaps, but always a fancy pertaining to the indulgence of self. Tredennis had heard him lie,—not wickedly or[Pg 315] awkwardly, so far; but with grace and freedom from embarrassment. It was his accidental detection of one of the most trivial and ready of these falsehoods which had first roused him to distrust. He remembered now, as by a flash, that it had been a lie about Planefield, and that it had been told to Bertha. He had wondered at the time what its object could be; now he thought he saw, and in a measure comprehended, the short-sighted folly which had caused the weak, easily swayed nature to drift into such danger. \"He does not realize what he is doing,\" was his thought. \"He would lie to me if I accused him of it.\" Of these two things he was convinced: that the first step had been merely one of many whims, whatever the results following might be, and that no statement or promise Amory might make could be relied on. There was no knowing what he had done or what he would do. As he had found entertainment in the contents of the \"museum,\" so it was as probable he had, at the outset, amused himself with his fancies concerning the Westoria lands, which had, at last, so far fascinated and dazed him as to lead him into the committal of follies he had not paused to excuse even to himself. He had not thought it necessary to excuse them. Why should he not take the legal business in hand, and since there was no reason against that, why should he not also interest himself in the investigations and be on intimate terms with the men who were a part of the brilliant project? Why should not his wife entertain them, as she entertained the rest of her friends and acquaintances? Tredennis felt that he had learned enough of the man\u0027s mental habits to follow him pretty closely in his reasoning—when he reasoned. While he had looked on silently, the colonel had learned a great deal and grown worldly-wise and quicker of perception than he could have believed possible in times gone by. He was only half conscious that this was because he had now an object in view which he had not had before; that he was alert[Pg 316] and watchful because there was some one he wished to shield; that he was no longer indifferent to the world and its ways,—no longer given to underrating its strength and weaknesses, its faults and follies, because he wished to be able to defend himself against them, if such a thing should become necessary. He had gained wisdom enough to appreciate the full significance of the low-voiced, apparently carelessly uttered words he had just heard; and to feel his own almost entire helplessness in the matter. To appeal to Amory would be useless; to go to the professor impossible; how could he carry to him such a story, unless it assumed proportions such as to make the step a last terrible resource? He had been looking older and acknowledging himself frailer during the last year; certainly he was neither mentally nor physically in the condition to meet such a blow, if it was possible to spare it to him. Tredennis looked across the room at Bertha again. It seemed that there was only one very simple thing he could do now. \"She will probably be angry and think I have come to interfere, if I go to her,\" he said; \"but I will go nevertheless. At least, I am not one of them,—every one knows that,—and perhaps it will occur to her to go home.\" There was resolution on his face when he approached her. He wore the look which never failed to move her more strongly than any other thing on earth had ever done before, and whose power over her cost her all the resistance of which she was capable. It had sometimes made her wonder if, after all, it was true that women liked to be subdued—to be ruled a little—if their rulers were gentle as well as strong. She had heard it said so, and had often laughed at the sentiment of the popular fallacy. She used to smile at it when it presented itself to her even in this manner; but there had been occasions—times perhaps when she was very tired—when she had known that she would have been[Pg 317] glad to give way before this look, to obey it, to feel the relief of deciding for herself no more. Such a feeling rose within her now. She looked neither tired nor worn; but a certain deadly sense of fatigue, which was becoming a physical habit with her, had been growing upon her all the evening. The color on her cheeks was feverish, her limbs ached, her eyes were bright with her desperate eagerness to sustain herself. Once or twice, when she had laughed or spoken, she had been conscious of such an unnatural tone in her voice that her heart had trembled with fear lest others should have heard it too. It seemed impossible to her that they should not, and that these men who listened and applauded her should not see that often she scarcely heard them, and that she dare not stop for fear of forgetting them altogether and breaking down in some dreadful way, which would show that all her spirit and gayety was a lie, and only a lie poorly acted, after all. She thought she knew what Tredennis had come to her for. She had not lost sight of him at any time. She had known where he stood or sat, and whom he spoke to, and had known that he had seen her also. She had met his eyes now and then, and smiled and looked away again, beginning to talk to her admirers with more spirit than ever each time. What else was there to do but go on as she had begun? She knew only too well what reason there was in herself that she should not falter. If it had been strong yesterday, it was ten times stronger to-day, and would be stronger to-morrow and for many a bitter day to come. But when he came to her she only smiled up at him, as she would have smiled at Planefield, or the gallant and spacious Barnacles, or any other of the men she knew. \"I hope you have had a pleasant evening,\" she said. \"You enjoy things of this sort so much, however, that you are always safe. I saw you talking in the most vivacious manner to that pretty Miss Stapleton,—the one[Pg 318] with the eyelashes,—or rather you were listening vivaciously. You are such a good listener.\" \"That\u0027s an accomplishment, isn\u0027t it?\" said Planefield, with his easy air. \"It is a gift of the gods,\" she answered. \"And it was bestowed on Colonel Tredennis.\" \"There are talkers, you know,\" suggested the Senator, \"who would make a good listener of a man without the assistance of the gods.\" \"Do you mean the Miss Stapleton with the eyelashes?\" inquired Bertha, blandly. \"Oh, come now,\" was the response. \"I think you know I don\u0027t mean the Miss Stapleton with the eyelashes. If I did, it would be more economical to make the remark to her.\" \"Ah!\" said Bertha, blandly again. \"You mean me? I hoped so. Thank you very much. And I am glad you said it before Colonel Tredennis, because it may increase his confidence in me, which is not great. I am always glad when any one pays me a compliment in his presence.\" \"Does he never pay you compliments himself?\" asked Planefield. Bertha gave Tredennis a bright, full glance. \"Did you ever pay me a compliment?\" she said. \"Will you ever pay me a compliment—if I should chance to deserve one?\" \"Yes,\" he answered, his face unsmiling, his voice inflexible. \"May I begin now? You always deserve them. My only reason for failing to pay them is because I am not equal to inventing such as would be worthy of you. Your eyes are like stars—your dress is the prettiest in the room—every man present is your slave and every woman pales before you—the President is going home now only because you have ceased to smile upon him.\" The color on Bertha\u0027s cheek faded a little, but her smile did not. She checked him with a gesture. [Pg 319] \"Thank you,\" she said, \"that will do! You are even better than Senator Planefield. My eyes are like stars—my dress is perfection! I myself am as brilliant as—as the chandelier! Really, there seems nothing left for me to do but to follow the President, who, as you said, has been good enough to take his leave and give us permission to retire.\" And she rose from her chair. She made her adieus to Planefield, who bestowed upon Tredennis a sidelong scowl, thinking that it was he who was taking her away. It consoled him but little that she gave him her hand—in a most gracious farewell. He had been enjoying himself as he did not often enjoy himself, and the sight of the colonel\u0027s unresponsive countenance filled him with silent rage. It happened that it was not the first time, or even the second, that this gentleman had presented himself inopportunely. \"The devil take his grim airs!\" was his cordial mental exclamation. \"What does he mean by them, and what is he always turning up for when no one wants to see him?\" Something of this amiable sentiment was in his expression, but the colonel did not seem to see it; his countenance was as unmoved as ever when he led his charge away, her little hand resting on his arm. In truth, he was thinking of other things. Suddenly he had made up his mind that there was one effort he could make: that, if he could conquer himself and his own natural feeling of reluctance, he might speak to Bertha herself in such words as she would be willing to listen to and reflect upon. It seemed impossible to tell her all, but surely he might frame such an appeal as would have some small weight with her. It was not an easy thing to do. He must present himself to her in the r?le of an individual who, having no right to interfere with her actions, still took upon himself to do so; who spoke when it would have seemed better taste to be silent; who delivered homilies with the manner of one who[Pg 320] thought himself faultless, and so privileged to preach and advise. \"But what of that?\" he said, checking himself impatiently in the midst of these thoughts. \"I am always thinking of myself, and of how I shall appear in her eyes! Am I a boy lover trying to please her, or a man who would spare and shield her? Let her think poorly of me if she chooses, if she will only listen and realize her danger when her anger is over.\" The standard for his own conduct which he had set up was not low, it will be observed. All that he demanded of himself was utter freedom from all human weakness, and even liability to temptation; an unselfishness without blemish, a self-control without flaw; that he should bear his own generous anguish without the movement of a muscle; that he should wholly ignore the throbbing of his own wounds, remembering only the task he had set himself; that his watchfulness over himself should never falter, and his courage never be shaken. It was, perhaps, indicative of a certain degree of noble simplicity that he demanded this of himself, which he would have asked of no other human creature, and that at no time did the thought cross his mind that the thing he demanded was impossible of attainment. When he failed, as he knew he often did; when he found it difficult to efface himself utterly from his own thoughts and was guilty of the weakness of allowing himself to become a factor in them; when his unhappiness was stronger than himself; when he was stirred to resentment, or conscious of weariness, and the longing to utter some word which would betray him and ask for pity,—he never failed to condemn himself in bitterness of spirit as ignoble and unworthy. \"Let her be angry with me if she chooses,\" he thought now. \"It is for me to say my say, and leave the rest to her—and I will try to say it kindly.\" He would set aside the bitter feeling and resentment of her trifling which had beset him more than once [Pg 321]during the evening; he would forget them, as it was but right and just that they should be forgotten. When he spoke, as they went up the staircase together, his tone was so kind that Bertha glanced up at him, and saw that his face had changed, and, though still grave, was kind, too. When she joined him after leaving the cloak-room, he spoke to her of her wrap again, and asked her to draw it more closely about her; when he helped her into the carriage, there was that in his light touch which brought back to her with more than its usual strength the familiar sense of quiet protection and support. \"It would be easier,\" she thought, \"if he would be angry. Why is he not angry? He was an hour ago—and surely I have done enough.\" But he showed no signs of disapproval,—he was determined that he would not do that,—though their drive was rather a silent one again. And yet, by the time they reached home, Bertha was in some indefinite way prepared for the question he put to her as he assisted her to alight. \"May I come in for a little while?\" he asked. \"I know it is late, but—there is something I must say to you.\" \"Something you must say to me?\" she repeated. \"I am sure it must be something interesting and something I should like to hear. Come in, by all means.\" So they entered the house together, and went into the parlor. They found a fire burning there, and Bertha\u0027s chair drawn up before it. She loosened her wrap rather deliberately and threw it off, and then sat down as deliberately, arranging her footstool and draperies until she had attained the desired amount of languid comfort in her position. Tredennis did not speak until she was settled. He leaned against the mantel, his eyes bent on the fire. Being fairly arranged, Bertha held out her hand. \"Will you give me that feather screen, if you please?\" she said,—\"the one made of peacock feathers. When one attains years of discretion, one has some care for[Pg 322] one\u0027s complexion. Did it ever occur to you how serious such matters are, and that the difference between being eighteen and eighty is almost wholly a matter of complexion? If one could remain pink and smooth, one might possibly overcome the rest, and there would be no such thing as growing old. It is not a single plank which is between ourselves and eternity, but a—Would the figure of speech appear appropriate if one said \u0027a single cuticle\u0027? I am afraid not.\" He took the screen from its place and regarded it a little absently. \"You had this in your hand the first night I came here,\" he said, \"when you told the story of your great lady.\" She took it from him. \"That was a pretty little story,\" she said. \"It was a dear little story. My great lady was present to-night. We passed and repassed each other, and gazed placidly at each other\u0027s eyebrows. We were vaguely haunted by a faint fancy that we might have met before; but the faculties become dimmed with advancing years, and we could not remember where or how it happened. One often feels that one has met people, you know.\" She balanced her gleaming screen gracefully, looking at him from under its shadow. \"And it is not only on account of my complexion that I want my peacock feathers,\" she continued, dropping her great lady by the way as if she had not picked her up in the interim. \"I want them to conceal my emotions if your revelations surprise me. Have you never seen me use them when receiving the compliments of Senator Planefield and his friends? A little turn to the right or the left—the least graceful little turn—and I can look as I please, and they will see nothing and only hear my voice, which, I trust, is always sufficiently under control.\" She wondered if it was sufficiently under control now. She was not sure, and because she was not sure she[Pg 323] made the most reckless speeches she could think of. There was a story she had heard of a diplomatist, who once so entirely bewildered his fellow-diplomats that they found it impossible to cope with him; they were invariably outwitted by him: the greatest subtlety, the most wondrous coup d\u0027état, he baffled alike; mystery surrounded him; his every act was enshrouded in it; with such diplomatic methods it was madness to combat. When his brilliant and marvellous career was at an end his secret was discovered; on every occasion he had told the simple, exact truth. As she leaned back in her chair and played with her screen Bertha thought of this story. She had applied it to herself before this. The one thing which would be incredible to him at this moment, the one thing it would appear more than incredible that she should tell him, would be the truth—if he realized what that truth was. Any other story, however wild, might have its air or suggestion of plausibility; but that, being what it was, she should have the nerve, the daring, the iron strength of self-control, which it would require to make a fearless jest of the simple, terrible truth, it would seem to him the folly of a madman to believe, she knew. To look him in the eye with a smile, and tell him that she feared his glance and dreaded his words, would place the statement without the pale of probability. She had told him things as true before, and he had not once thought of believing them. \"It is never difficult to persuade him not to believe me,\" she thought. There was no one of her many moods of which she felt such terror, in her more natural moments, as of the one which held possession of her now; and yet there was none she felt to be so safe, which roused her to such mental exhilaration while its hour lasted, or resulted in such reaction when it had passed. \"I am never afraid then,\" she said to Agnes once. \"There is nothing I could not bear. It seems as if I were made of steel, and had never been soft or timid in my life. Everything is gone but my power[Pg 324] over myself, and—yes, it intoxicates me. Until it is over I am not really hurt, I think. There was something I read once about a man who was broken on the wheel, and while it was being done he laughed, and shrieked, and sang. I think all women are like that sometimes: while they are being broken they laugh, and shriek, and sing; but afterward—afterward\"— So now she spoke the simple truth. \"I shall have you at a disadvantage, you may observe,\" she said. \"I shall see your face, and you will not see mine—unless I wish you to do so. A little turn of my wrist, and you have only my voice to rely upon. Do you wish to speak to me before Richard comes in? If so, I am afraid you must waste no time, as his train is due at twelve. You were going to say\"— \"I am afraid it is something you will not like to hear,\" he answered, \"though I did not contradict you when you suggested that it was.\" \"You were outside then,\" she replied, \"and I might not have let you come in.\" \"No,\" he said, \"you might not.\" He looked at the feather screen which she had inclined a trifle. \"Your screen reminded me of your great lady, Bertha,\" he said, \"because I saw her to-night, and—and heard her—and she was speaking of you.\" \"Of me!\" she replied. \"That was kind indeed.\" \"No,\" he returned, \"it was not. She was neither generous nor lenient; she did not even speak the truth; and yet, as I heard her, I was obliged to confess that, to those who did not know you and only saw you as you were to-night, what she said might not appear so false.\" Bertha turned her screen aside and looked at him composedly. \"She was speaking of Senator Planefield,\" she remarked, \"and Judge Ballard, and Commander [Pg 325]Barnacles. She reprehended my frivolity and deplored the tendency of the age.\" \"She was speaking of Senator Planefield,\" he answered. She moved the screen a little. \"Has Senator Planefield been neglecting her?\" she said. \"I hope not.\" \"Lay your screen aside, Bertha,\" he commanded, hotly. \"You don\u0027t need it. What I have to say will not disturb you, as I feared it would—no, I should say as I hoped it would. It is only this: that these people were speaking lightly of you—that they connected your name with Planefield\u0027s as—as no honest man is willing that the name of his wife should be connected with that of another man. That was all; and I, who am always interfering with your pleasures, could not bear it, and so have made the blunder of interfering again.\" There were many things she had borne, of which she had said nothing to Agnes Sylvestre in telling her story,—things she had forced herself to ignore or pass by; but just now some sudden, passionate realization of them was too much for her, and she answered him in words she felt it was madness to utter even as they leaped to her lips. \"Richard has not been unwilling,\" she said. \"Richard has not resented it!\" \"If he had been in my place,\" he began, feeling ill at ease—\"if he understood\"— She dropped her screen upon her lap and looked at him with steady eyes. \"No,\" she interposed, \"that is a mistake. He would not have looked upon the matter as you do. It is only a trifle, after all. You are overestimating its importance.\" \"Am I?\" he said. \"Do you regard it in that light?\" \"Yes,\" she replied, \"you are too fastidious. Is the spiteful comment of an ill-natured, unattractive woman, upon a woman who chances to be more fortunate than[Pg 326] herself, of such weight that it is likely to influence people greatly? Women are always saying such things of one another when they are angry. I cannot say them of our friend, it is true, because—because she is so fortunate as to be placed by nature beyond reproach. If I had her charms, and her manner, and her years, I should, perhaps, be beyond reproach too.\" She wondered if he would deign to answer her at all. It seemed as if the execrable bad taste of her words must overwhelm him. If he had turned his back upon her and left the room, she would have felt no surprise. To have seen him do so would have been almost a relief. But, for him, he merely stood perfectly still and watched her. \"Go on,\" he said, at length. She faintly smiled. \"Do you want me to say more?\" she asked. \"Is not that enough? My great lady was angry, and was stupid enough to proclaim the fact.\" She made a quick turn toward him. \"To whom was she speaking?\" she demanded. \"To a man or a woman?\" \"To a man,\" he answered. She sank back into her chair and smiled again. \"Ah,\" she said, \"then it is of less consequence even than I imagined. It is pleasant to reflect that it was a man. One is not afraid of men.\" She lifted the screen from her lap, and for a moment he could not see her face. \"Now he will go,\" she was saying to herself breathlessly behind it. \"Now he must go. He will go now—and he will not come back.\" But he did not go. It was the irony of fate that he should spare her nothing. In the few moments of silence which followed he had a great struggle with himself. It was such a struggle that, when it was at an end, he was pale and looked subdued. There was a chair near her. He went to it and sat down at her side. \"Bertha,\" he said, \"there has been one thing in the[Pg 327] midst of all—all this, to which you have been true. You have loved your children when it has seemed that nothing else would touch you. I say \u0027seemed,\u0027 because I swear to you I am unmoved in my disbelief in what you persist in holding before me—for what reason you know best. You love your children; you don\u0027t lie to me about that—you don\u0027t lie to yourself about it. Perhaps it is only nature, as you said once, and not tenderness; I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t understand you; but give yourself a few moments to think of them now.\" He saw the hand holding the screen tremble; he could not see her face. \"What—must I think of them?\" He looked down at the floor, knitting his brows and dragging at his great mustache. \"I overestimate the importance of things,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t seem to know much about the standards society sets up for itself; but it does not seem a trifle to me that their mother should be spoken of lightly. There was a girl I knew once—long ago\"—He stopped and looked up at her with sudden, sad candor. \"It is you I am thinking of, Bertha,\" he said; \"you, as I remember you first when you came home from school. I was thinking of your mother and your dependence upon her, and the tenderness there was between you.\" \"And you were thinking,\" she added, \"that Janey\u0027s mother would not be so good and worthy of trust. That is true.\" \"I have no answer to make to that, Bertha,\" he said. \"None.\" She laid the screen upon her lap once more. \"But it is true,\" she said; \"it is true. Why do you refuse to believe it? Are you so good that you cannot? Yes, you are! As for me—what did I tell you? I am neither good nor bad, and I want excitement. Nine people out of ten are so, and I am no worse than the rest of the nine. One must be amused. If I were religious, I should have Dorcas societies and missions.[Pg 328] As I am not, I have\"—she paused one second, no more—\"I have Senator Planefield.\" She could bear the inaction of sitting still no longer. She got up. \"You have an ideal for everything,\" she said, \"for men, women, and children,—especially for women, I think. You are always telling yourself that they are good, and pure, and loving, and faithful; that they adore their children, and are true to their friends. It is very pretty, but it is not always the fact. You try to believe it is true of me; but it is not. I am not your ideal woman. I have told you so. Have you not found out yet that Bertha Amory is not what you were so sure Bertha Herrick would be?\" \"Yes,\" he answered. \"You—you have convinced me of that.\" \"It was inevitable,\" she continued. \"I was very young then. I knew nothing of the world or of its distractions and temptations. A thousand things have happened to change me. And, after all, what right had you to expect so much of me? I was neither one thing nor the other, even then; I was only ignorant. You could not expect me to be ignorant always.\" \"Bertha,\" he demanded, \"what are you trying to prove to me?\" \"Only a little thing,\" she answered; \"that I need my amusements, and cannot live without them.\" He rose from his seat also. \"That you cannot live without Senator Planefield?\" he said. \"Go and tell him so,\" was her reply. \"It would please him, and perhaps this evening he would be inclined to place some confidence in the statement.\" She turned and walked to the end of the room; then she came back and stood quite still before him. \"I am going to tell you something I would rather keep to myself,\" she said. \"It may save us both trouble if I don\u0027t spare myself as my vanity prompts[Pg 329] me to do. I said I was no worse than the other nine; but I am—a little. I am not very fond of anything or any one. Not so fond even of—Richard and the children, as I seem. I know that, though they do not. If they were not attractive and amiable, or if they interfered with my pleasures, my affection would not stand many shocks. In a certain way I am emotional enough always to appear better than I am. Things touch me for a moment. I was touched a little just now when you spoke of remembering my being a girl. I was moved when Janey was ill and you were so good to me. I almost persuaded myself that I was good too, and faithful and affectionate, and yet at the same time I knew it was only a fancy, and I should get over it. It is easy for me to laugh and cry when I choose. There are tears in my eyes now, but—they don\u0027t deceive me.\" \"They look like real tears, Bertha,\" he said. \"They would have deceived me—if you had not given me warning.\" \"They always look real,\" she answered. \"And is not there a sort of merit in my not allowing you to believe in them? Call it a merit, won\u0027t you?\" His face became like a mask. For several seconds he did not speak. The habit he had of taking refuge in utter silence was the strongest weapon he could use against her. He did not know its strength; he only knew that it was the signal of his own desperate helplessness; but it left her without defence or resource. \"Won\u0027t you?\" she said, feeling that she must say something. He hesitated before replying. \"No,\" he answered, stonily, after the pause. \"I won\u0027t call it a merit. I wish you would leave me—something.\" That was very hard. \"It is true,\" she returned, \"that I do not—leave you very much.\" [Pg 330] The words cost her such an effort that there were breaks between them. \"No,\" he said, \"not much.\" There was something almost dogged in his manner. He could not bear a great deal more, and his consciousness of this truth forced him to brace himself to outward hardness. \"I don\u0027t ask very much,\" he said. \"I only ask you to spare yourself and your children. I only ask you to keep out of danger. It is yourself I ask you to think of, not me. Treat me as you like, but don\u0027t—don\u0027t be cruel to yourself. I am afraid it does not do for a woman—even a woman as cool as you are—to trifle with herself and her name. I have heard it said so, and I could not remain silent after hearing what I did to-night.\" He turned as if to move away. \"You are going?\" she said. \"Yes,\" he replied. \"It is very late, and it would be useless to say any more.\" \"You have not shaken hands with me,\" she said when he was half way to the door. The words forced themselves from her. Her power of endurance failed her at the last moment, as it had done before and would do again. He came back to her. \"You will never hold out your hand to me when I shall not be ready to take it, Bertha,\" he said. \"You know that.\" She did not speak. \"You are chilled,\" he said. \"Your hand is quite cold.\" \"Yes,\" she replied. \"I shall lie down on the sofa by the fire a little while before going upstairs.\" Without saying anything he left her, drew the sofa nearer to the hearth and arranged the cushions. \"I would advise you not to fall asleep,\" he said when this was done. [Pg 331] \"I shall not fall asleep,\" she answered. She went to the sofa and sat down on it. \"Good-night,\" she said. And he answered her \"Good-night,\" and went out of the room. She sat still a few seconds after he was gone, and then lay down. Her eyes wandered over the room. She saw the ornaments, the pictures on the wall, the design of the rug, every minute object, with a clearness which seemed to magnify its importance and significance. There was a little Cloissoné jar whose pattern she never seemed to have seen before; she was looking at it when at last she spoke. \"It is very hard to live,\" she said. \"I wish it was not—so hard. I wish there was some way of helping one\u0027s self, but there is not. One can only go on—and on—and there is always something worse coming.\" She put her hand upon her breast. Something rose beneath it which gave her suffocating pain. She staggered to her feet, pressing one hand on the other to crush this pain down. No woman who has suffered such a moment but has done the same thing, and done it in vain. She fell, half-kneeling, half-sitting, upon the rug, her body against her chair, her arms flung out. \"Why do you struggle with me?\" she cried, between her sobs. \"Why do you look at me so? You—hurt me! I love you! Oh! let me go—let me go! Don\u0027t you know—I can\u0027t bear it!\" In the street she heard the carriages rolling homeward from some gay gathering. One of them stopped a few doors away, and the people got out of it laughing and talking. \"Don\u0027t laugh!\" she said, shuddering. \"No one—should laugh! I laugh! O God! O God!\" In half an hour Richard came in. He had taken Miss Varien home, and remained to talk with her a short[Pg 332] time. As he entered the house Bertha was going up the staircase, her gleaming dress trailing behind her, her feather-trimmed wrap over her arm. She turned and smiled down at him. \"Your charms will desert you if you keep such hours as these,\" she said. \"How did you enjoy yourself, or, rather, how did you enjoy Miss Varien, and how many dazzling remarks did she make?\" \"More than I could count,\" he said, laughing. \"Wait a moment for me—I am coming up.\" And he ran up the steps lightly and joined her, slipping his arm about her waist. \"You look tired,\" he said, \"but your charms never desert you. Was that the shudder of guilt? Whose peace of mind have you been destroying?\" \"Colonel Tredennis\u0027,\" she answered. \"Then it was not the shudder of guilt,\" he returned, laughing again. And, as she leaned gently against him, he bent and kissed her.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2698/74185.html","bookId":1460,"book":{"id":1460,"title":"Through One Administration","description":"简介： Eight years before the Administration rendered important by the series of events and incidents which form the present story, there had come to Washington, on a farewell visit to a distant relative with whom he was rather a favorite, a young officer w...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2698","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:25:09 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:25:09 AM"}}
