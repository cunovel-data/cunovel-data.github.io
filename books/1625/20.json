Magic\u0027s there to be ruled, not for ruling.\u0027\\n\\n Nanny nodded and then, remembering a promise, reached down and picked up a fragment of stone from the rubble on the tunnel floor.\\n\\n \u0027I thought you\u0027d forgotten,\u0027 said the ghost of the king, by her ear.\\n\\n Further down the passage the Fool was capering after Magrat.\\n\\n \u0027Can I see you again?\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027Well . . . I don\u0027t know,\u0027 said Magrat, her heart singing a smug song.\\n\\n \u0027How about tonight?\u0027 said the Fool.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, no,\u0027 said Magrat. \u0027I\u0027m very busy tonight.\u0027 She had intended to curl up with a hot milk drink and Goodie Whemper\u0027s notebooks on experimental astrology, but instinct told her that any suitor should have an uphill struggle put in front of him, just to make him keener.\\n\\n \u0027Tomorrow night, then?\u0027 the Fool persisted.\\n\\n \u0027I think I should be washing my hair.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I could get Friday night free.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We do a lot of work at night, you see—\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The afternoon, then.\u0027\\n\\n Magrat hesitated. Perhaps instinct had got it wrong. \u0027Well—\u0027 she said.\\n\\n \u0027About two o\u0027clock. In the meadow by the pond, all right?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well—\u0027\\n\\n \u0027See you there, then. All right?\u0027 said the Fool desperately.\\n\\n \u0027Fool!\u0027 The duchess\u0027s voice echoed along the passage, and a look of terror crossed his face.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve got to go,\u0027 he said. \u0027The meadow, okay? I\u0027ll wear something so you recognise me. All right?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All right,\u0027 echoed Magrat, hypnotised by the sheer pressure of his persistence. She turned and ran after the other witches.\\n\\n There was pandemonium outside the castle. The crowd that had been there at Granny\u0027s arrival had grown considerably, and had flowed in through the now unguarded gateway and lapped around the keep. Civil disobedience was new to Lancre, but its inhabitants had already mastered some of its more elementary manifestations, viz, the jerking of rakes and sickles in the air with simple up-and-down motions accompanied by grimaces and cries of \u0027Gerrh!\u0027, although a few citizens, who hadn\u0027t quite grasped the idea, were waving flags and cheering. Advanced students were already eyeing the more combustible buildings inside the walls. Several sellers of hot meat pies and sausages in a bun had appeared from nowhere[13] and were doing a brisk trade. Pretty soon someone was going to throw something.\\n\\n The three witches stood at the top of the steps that led to the keep\u0027s main door and surveyed the seas of faces.\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s our Jason,\u0027 said Nanny happily. \u0027And Wane and Darron and Kev and Trev and Nev—\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I will remember their faces,\u0027 said Lord Felmet, emerging between them and putting a hand on their shoulders. \u0027And do you see my archers, on the wails?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I see \u0027em,\u0027 said Granny grimly.\\n\\n \u0027Then smile and wave,\u0027 said the duke. \u0027So that the people may know that all is well. After all, have you not been to see me today on matters of state?\u0027\\n\\n He leaned closer to Granny.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, there are a hundred things you could do,\u0027 he said. \u0027But the ending would always be the same.\u0027 He drew back. \u0027I\u0027m not an unreasonable man, I hope,\u0027 he added, in cheerful tones. \u0027Perhaps, if you persuade the people to be calm, I may be prevailed upon to moderate my rule somewhat. I make no promises, of course.\u0027\\n\\n Granny said nothing.\\n\\n \u0027Smile and wave,\u0027 commanded the duke.\\n\\n Granny raised one hand in a vague motion and produced a brief rictus that had nothing whatsoever to do with humour. Then she scowled and nudged Nanny Ogg, who was waving and mugging like a maniac.\\n\\n \u0027No need to get carried away,\u0027 she hissed.\\n\\n \u0027But there\u0027s our Reel and our Sharleen and their babbies,\u0027 said Nanny. \u0027Coo-eee!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Will you shut up, you daft old besom!\u0027 snapped Granny. \u0027And pull yourself together!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Jolly good, well done,\u0027 said the duke. He raised his hands, or at least his hand. The other still ached. He\u0027d tried the grater again last night, but it hadn\u0027t worked.\\n\\n \u0027People of Lancre,\u0027 he cried, \u0027do not be afeared! I am your friend. I will protect you from the witches! They have agreed to leave you in peace!\u0027\\n\\n Granny stared at him as he spoke. He\u0027s one of these here maniac depressives, she said. Up and down like a woss-name. Kill you one minute and ask you how you\u0027re feeling the next.\\n\\n She became aware that he was looking at her expectantly.\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I said, I\u0027ll now call upon the respected Granny Weatherwax to say a few words, ha ha,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027You said that, did you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ve gone a long way too far,\u0027 said Granny.\\n\\n \u0027I have, haven\u0027t I!\u0027 The duke giggled.\\n\\n Granny turned to the expectant crowds, which went silent.\\n\\n \u0027Go home,\u0027 she said.\\n\\n There was a further long silence.\\n\\n \u0027Is that all?\u0027 said the duke.\\n\\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What about pledges of eternal allegiance?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What about them? Gytha, will you stop waving at people!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sorry.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And now we are going to go, too,\u0027 said Granny.\\n\\n \u0027But we were getting on so well,\u0027 said the duke.\\n\\n \u0027Come, Gytha,\u0027 said Granny icily. \u0027And where\u0027s Magrat got to?\u0027\\n\\n Magrat looked up guiltily. She had been deep in conversation with the Fool, although it was the kind of conversation where both parties spend a lot of time looking at their feet and picking at their fingernails. Ninety per cent of true love is acute, ear-burning embarrassment.\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027re leaving,\u0027 said Granny.\\n\\n \u0027Friday afternoon, remember,\u0027 hissed the Fool.\\n\\n \u0027Well, if I can,\u0027 said Magrat.\\n\\n Nanny Ogg leered.\\n\\n And so Granny Weatherwax swept down the steps and through the crowds, with the other two running behind her. Several of the grinning guards caught her eye and wished they hadn\u0027t, but here and there, among the watching crowd, was a barely suppressed snigger. She hurtled through the gateway, across the drawbridge and through the town. Granny walking fast could beat most other people at a run.\\n\\n Behind them the duke, who had crested the latest maniac peak on the switchback of his madness and was coasting speedily towards the watersplash of despair, laughed.\\n\\n \u0027Ha ha.\u0027\\n\\n Granny didn\u0027t stop until she was outside the town and under the welcoming eaves of the forest. She turned off the road and flumped down on a log, her face in her hands.\\n\\n The other two approached her carefully. Magrat patted her on the back.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t despair,\u0027 she said. \u0027You handled it very well, we thought.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I ain\u0027t despairing, I\u0027m thinking,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027Go away.\u0027\\n\\n Nanny Ogg raised her eyebrows at Magrat in a warning fashion. They backed off to a suitable distance although, with Granny in her present mood, the next universe might not be far enough, and sat down on a moss-grown stone.\\n\\n \u0027Are you all right?\u0027 said Magrat. \u0027They didn\u0027t do anything, did they?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Never laid a finger on me,\u0027 said Nanny. She sniffed. \u0027They\u0027re not your real royalty,\u0027 she added. \u0027Old King Gruneweld, for one, he wouldn\u0027t have wasted time waving things around and menacing people. It\u0027d been bang, needles right under the fingernails from the word go, and no messing. None of this evil laughter stuff. He was a real king. Very gracious.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He was threatening to burn you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, I wouldn\u0027t of stood for it. I see you\u0027ve got a follower,\u0027 said Nanny.\\n\\n \u0027Sorry?\u0027 said Magrat.\\n\\n The young fellow with the bells,\u0027 said Nanny. \u0027And the face like a spaniel what\u0027s just been kicked.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, him.\u0027 Magrat blushed hotly under her pale makeup. \u0027Really, he\u0027s just this man. He just follows me around.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Can be difficult, can that,\u0027 said Nanny sagely.\\n\\n \u0027Besides, he\u0027s so small. And he capers all over the place,\u0027 said Magrat.\\n\\n \u0027Looked at him carefully, have you?\u0027 said the old witch.\\n\\n \u0027Pardon?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You haven\u0027t, have you? I thought not. He\u0027s a very clever man, that Fool. He ought to have been one of them actor men.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What do you mean?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Next time you have a look at him like a witch, not like a woman,\u0027 said Nanny, and gave Magrat a conspiratorial nudge. \u0027Good bit of work with the door back there,\u0027 she added. \u0027Coming on well, you are. I hope you told him about Greebo.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He said he\u0027d let him out directly, Nanny.\u0027\\n\\n There was a snort from Granny Weatherwax.\\n\\n \u0027Did you hear the sniggering in the crowd?\u0027 she said. \u0027Someone sniggered!\u0027\\n\\n Nanny Ogg sat down beside her.\\n\\n \u0027And a couple of them pointed,\u0027 she said. \u0027I know.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s not to be borne!\u0027\\n\\n Magrat sat down on the other end of the log.\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s other witches,\u0027 she said. \u0027There\u0027s lots of witches further up the Ramtops. Maybe they can help.\u0027\\n\\n The other two looked at her in pained surprise.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t think we need go that far,\u0027 sniffed Granny. \u0027Asking for help.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Very bad practice,\u0027 nodded Nanny Ogg.\\n\\n \u0027But you asked a demon to help you,\u0027 said Magrat.\\n\\n \u0027No, we didn\u0027t,\u0027 said Granny.\\n\\n \u0027Right. We didn\u0027t.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We ordered it to assist.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027S\u0027right.\u0027\\n\\n Granny Weatherwax stretched out her legs and looked at her boots. They were good strong boots, with hobnails and crescent-shaped scads; you couldn\u0027t believe a cobbler had made them, someone had laid down a sole and built up from there.\\n\\n \u0027I mean, there\u0027s that witch over Skund way,\u0027 she said. \u0027Sister Whosis, wossname, her son went off to be a sailor – you know, Gytha, her who sniffs and puts them antimassacres on the backs of chairs soon as you sits down—\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Grodley,\u0027 said Nanny Ogg. \u0027Sticks her little finger out when she drinks her tea and drops her Haitches all the time.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes. Hwell. I haven\u0027t hlowered myself to talk to her hever since that business with the gibbet, you recall. I daresay she\u0027d just love to come snooping haround here, running her fingers over heverything and sniffing, telling us how to do things. Oh. yes. Help. We\u0027d all be in a fine to-do if we went around helping all the time.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, and over Skund way the trees talk to you and walk around of night,\u0027 said Nanny. \u0027Without even asking permission. Very poor organisation.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not really good organisation, like we\u0027ve got here?\u0027 said Magrat.\\n\\n Granny stood up purposefully.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m going home,\u0027 she said.\\n\\n There are thousands of good reasons why magic doesn\u0027t rule the world. They\u0027re called witches and wizards. Magrat reflected, as she followed the other two back to the road.\\n\\n It was probably some wonderful organisation on the part of Nature to protect itself. It saw to it that everyone with any magical talent was about as ready to co-operate as a she-bear with toothache, so all that dangerous power was safely dissipated as random bickering and rivalry. There were differences in style, of course. Wizards assassinated each other in draughty corridors, witches just cut one another dead in the street. And they were all as self-centred as a spinning top. Even when they help other people, she thought, they\u0027re secretly doing it for themselves. Honestly, they\u0027re just like big children.\\n\\n Except for me, she thought smugly.\\n\\n \u0027She\u0027s very upset, isn\u0027t she,\u0027 said Magrat to Nanny Ogg.\\n\\n \u0027Ah, well,\u0027 said Nanny. \u0027There\u0027s the problem, see. The more you get used to magic, the more you don\u0027t want to use it. The more it gets in your way. I expect, when you were just starting out, you learned a few spells from Goodie Whemper, maysherestinpeace, and you used them all the time, didn\u0027t you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, yes. Everyone does.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well-known fact,\u0027 agreed Nanny. \u0027But when you get along in the Craft, you learn that the hardest magic is the sort you don\u0027t use at all.\u0027\\n\\n Magrat considered the proposition cautiously. \u0027This isn\u0027t some kind of Zen, is it?\u0027 she said.\\n\\n \u0027Dunno. Never seen one.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027When we were in the dungeons, Granny said something about trying the rocks. That sounded like pretty hard magic.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, Goodie wasn\u0027t much into rocks,\u0027 said Nanny. \u0027It\u0027s not really hard. You just prod their memories. You know, of the old days. When they were hot and runny.\u0027\\n\\n She hesitated, and her hand flew to her pocket. She gripped the lump of castle stone and relaxed. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wyrd-sisters-discworld-6/page-20.html","bookId":1625,"book":{"id":1625,"title":"Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6)","description":"Storyline: Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6) \\n Witches are not by nature gregarious, and they certainly don\u0027t have leaders.
