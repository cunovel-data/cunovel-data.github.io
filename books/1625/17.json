I am a king!\u0027 \u0027You are also dead, so I wouldn\u0027t aspire to hold any opinions if I was you. Now just be quiet and wait, like a good boy.\u0027 Against all his instincts, the king found himself obeying. There was no gainsaying that tone of voice. It spoke to him across the years, from his days in the nursery. Its echoes told him that if he didn\u0027t eat it all up he would be sent straight to bed. Nanny Ogg stirred in her chains. She hoped they would turn up soon. \u0027Er,\u0027 said the king uneasily. \u0027I feel I owe you an explanation . . .\u0027 \u0027Thank you,\u0027 said Granny Weatherwax, and because Shawn seemed to be expecting it, added, \u0027You\u0027ve been a good boy.\u0027 \u0027Yes\u0027m,\u0027 said Shawn. \u0027M\u0027m?\u0027 \u0027Was there something else?\u0027 Shawn twisted the end of his chain-mail vest out of embarrassment. \u0027It\u0027s not true what everyone\u0027s been saying about our mam, is it, m\u0027m?\u0027 he said. \u0027She doesn\u0027t go round putting evil curses on folk. Except for Daviss the butcher. And old Cakebread, after he kicked her cat. But they wasn\u0027t what you\u0027d call real curses, was they, m\u0027m?\u0027 \u0027You can stop calling me m\u0027m.\u0027 \u0027Yes, m\u0027m.\u0027 \u0027They\u0027ve been saying that, have they?\u0027 \u0027Yes, m\u0027m.\u0027 \u0027Well, your mam does upset people sometimes.\u0027 Shawn hopped from one leg to another. \u0027Yes, m\u0027m, but they says terrible things about you, m\u0027m, savin\u0027 your presence, m\u0027m.\u0027 Granny stiffened. \u0027What things?\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t like to say, m\u0027m.\u0027 \u0027What things?\u0027 Shawn considered his next move. There weren\u0027t many choices. \u0027A lot of things what aren\u0027t true, m\u0027m,\u0027 he said, establishing his credentials as early as possible. \u0027All sorts of things. Like, old Verence was a bad king and you helped him on the throne, and you caused that bad winter the other year, and old Norbut\u0027s cow dint give no milk after you looked at it. Lot of lies, m\u0027m,\u0027 he added, loyally. \u0027Right,\u0027 said Granny. She shut the door in his panting face, stood in thought for a moment, and retired to her rocking chair. Eventually she said, once more, \u0027Right.\u0027 A little later she added, \u0027She\u0027s a daft old besom, but we can\u0027t have people going round doing things to witches. Once you\u0027ve lost your respect, you ain\u0027t got a thing. I don\u0027t remember looking at old Norbut\u0027s cow. Who\u0027s old Norbut?\u0027 She stood up, took her pointed hat from its hook behind the door and, glaring into the mirror, skewered it in place with a number of ferocious hatpins. They slid on one by one by one, as unstoppable as the wrath of God. She vanished into the outhouse for a moment and came back with her witch\u0027s cloak, which served as a blanket for sick goats when not otherwise employed. Once upon a time it had been black velvet; now it was just black. It was carefully and slowly fastened by a tarnished silver brooch. No samurai, no questing knight, was ever dressed with as much ceremony. Finally Granny drew herself up, surveyed her dark reflection in the glass, gave a thin little smile of approval, and left via the back door. The air of menace was only slightly dispelled by the sound of her running up and down outside, trying to get her broomstick started. Magrat was also regarding herself in the mirror. She\u0027d dug out a startlingly green dress that was designed to be both revealing and clinging, and would have been if Magrat had anything to display or cling to, so she\u0027d shoved a couple of rolled-up stockings down the front in an effort to make good the more obvious deficiencies. She had also tried a spell on her hair, but it was naturally magic-resistant and already the natural shape was beginning to assert itself (a dandelion clock at about 2pm). Magrat had also tried makeup. This wasn\u0027t an unqualified success. She didn\u0027t have much practice. She was beginning to wonder if she\u0027d overdone the eyeshadow. Her neck, fingers and arms between them carried enough silverware to make a full-sized dinner service, and over everything she had thrown a black cloak lined with red silk. In a certain light and from a carefully chosen angle, Magrat was not unattractive. Whether any of these preparations did anything for her is debatable, but they did mean that a thin veneer of confidence overlaid her trembling heart. She drew herself up and turned this way and that. The clusters of amulets, magical jewellery and occult bangles on various parts of her body jingled together; any enemy wouldn\u0027t only have to be blind to fail to notice that a witch was approaching, he\u0027d have to be deaf as well. She turned to her worktable and examined what she rather self-consciously, and never in Granny\u0027s hearing, called her Tools of the Craft. There was the white-handled knife, used in the preparation of magical ingredients. There was the black-handled knife, used in the magical workings themselves; Magrat had carved so many runes into its handle it was in constant danger of falling in half. They were undoubtedly powerful, but . . . Magrat shook her head regretfully, went over to the kitchen dresser and took out the breadknife. Something told her that at times like these a good sharp breadknife was probably the best friend a girl could have. \u0027I spy, with my little eye,\u0027 said Nanny Ogg, \u0027something beginning with P.\u0027 The ghost of the king stared wearily around the dungeons. \u0027Pliers,\u0027 he suggested. \u0027No.\u0027 \u0027Pilliwinks?\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s a pretty name. What is it?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s a kind of thumbscrew. Look,\u0027 said the king. \u0027It\u0027s not that,\u0027 said Nanny. \u0027Choke-pear?\u0027 he said desperately. \u0027That\u0027s a C, and anyway I don\u0027t know what it is,\u0027 said Nanny Ogg. The king obligingly indicated it on the tray, and explained its use. \u0027Definitely not,\u0027 said Nanny. \u0027Smouldering Boot of Punishment?\u0027 said the king. \u0027You\u0027re a bit too good at these names,\u0027 said Nanny sharply. \u0027You sure you didn\u0027t use them when you were alive?\u0027 \u0027Absolutely, Nanny,\u0027 said the ghost. \u0027Boys that tell lies go to a bad place,\u0027 warned Nanny. \u0027Lady Felmet had most of them installed herself, it\u0027s the truth,\u0027 said the king desperately; he felt his position to be precarious enough without having any bad places to worry about. Nanny sniffed. \u0027Right, then,\u0027 she said, slightly mollified. \u0027It was “pinchers”.\u0027 \u0027But pinchers is just another name for pi—\u0027 the king began, and stopped himself in time. During his adult life he\u0027d been afraid of no man, beast or combination of the two, but Nanny\u0027s voice brought back old memories of schoolroom and nursery, of life under strict orders given by stern ladies in long skirts, and nursery food – mostly grey and brown -which seemed indigestible at the time but now appeared a distant ambrosia. \u0027That\u0027s five to me,\u0027 said Nanny happily. \u0027They\u0027ll be back soon,\u0027 said the king. \u0027Are you sure you\u0027ll be all right?\u0027 \u0027If I\u0027m not, precisely how much help can you be?\u0027 said Nanny. There was the sound of bolts sliding back. There was already a crowd outside the castle as Granny\u0027s broomstick wobbled uncertainly towards the ground. They went quiet as she strode forward, and parted to let her pass. She had a basket of apples under her arm. \u0027There\u0027s a witch in the dungeons,\u0027 someone whispered to Granny. \u0027And foul tortures, they say!\u0027 \u0027Nonsense,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027It couldn\u0027t be. I expect Nanny Ogg has just gone to advise the king, or something.\u0027 \u0027They say Jason Ogg\u0027s gone to fetch his brothers,\u0027 said a stallholder, in awe. \u0027I really advise you all to return home,\u0027 said Granny Weatherwax. \u0027There has probably been a misunderstanding. Everyone knows a witch cannot be held against her will.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s gone too far this time,\u0027 said a peasant. \u0027All this burning and taxing and now this. I blame you witches. It\u0027s got to stop. I know my rights.\u0027 \u0027What rights are they?\u0027 said Granny. \u0027Dunnage, cowhage-in-ordinary, badinage, leftovers, scrommidge, clary and spunt,\u0027 said the peasant promptly. \u0027And acornage, every other year, and the right to keep two-thirds of a goat on the common. Until he set fire to it. It was a bloody good goat, too.\u0027 \u0027A man could go far, knowing his rights like you do,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027But right now he should go home.\u0027 She turned and looked at the gates. There were two extremely apprehensive guards on duty. She walked up to them, and fixed one of them with a look. \u0027I am a harmless old seller of apples,\u0027 she said, in a voice more appropriate for the opening of hostilities in a middle-range war. \u0027Pray let me past, dearie.\u0027 The last word had knives in it. \u0027No-one must enter the castle,\u0027 said one of the guards. \u0027Orders of the duke.\u0027 Granny shrugged. The apple-seller gambit had never worked more than once in the entire history of witchcraft, as far as she knew, but it was traditional. \u0027I know you, Champett Poldy,\u0027 she said. \u0027I recall I laid out your grandad and I brought you into the world.\u0027 She glanced at the crowds, which had regathered a little way off, and turned back to the guard, whose face was already a mask of terror. She leaned a little closer, and said, \u0027I gave you your first good hiding in this valley of tears and by all the gods if you cross me now I will give you your last.\u0027 There was a soft metallic noise as the spear fell out of the man\u0027s fearful fingers. Granny reached and gave the trembling man a reassuring pat on the shoulder. \u0027But don\u0027t worry about it,\u0027 she added. \u0027Have an apple.\u0027 She made to step forward, and a second spear barred her way. She looked up with interest. The other guard was not a Ramtopper, but a city-bred mercenary brought up to swell the ranks depleted in recent years. His face was a patchwork of scar tissue. Several of the scars rearranged themselves into what was possibly a sneer. \u0027So that\u0027s witches\u0027 magic, is it?\u0027 said the guard. \u0027Pretty poor stuff. Maybe it frightens these country idiots, woman, but it doesn\u0027t frighten me.\u0027 \u0027I imagine it takes a lot to frighten a big strong lad like you,\u0027 said Granny, reaching up to her hat. \u0027And don\u0027t you try to put the wind up me, neither.\u0027 The guard stared straight ahead, and rocked gently on the balb of his feet. \u0027Old ladies like you, twisting people around. It shouldn\u0027t be stood for, like they say.\u0027 \u0027Just as you like,\u0027 said Granny, pushing the spear aside. \u0027Listen, I said—\u0027 the guard began, and grabbed Granny\u0027s shoulder. Her hand moved so quickly it hardly seemed to move at all, but suddenly he was clutching at his arm and moaning. Granny replaced the hatpin in her hat and ran for it. \u0027We will begin,\u0027 said the duchess, leering, \u0027with the Showing of the Implements.\u0027 \u0027Seen \u0027em,\u0027, said Nanny. \u0027Leastways, all the ones beginning with P, S, I, T and W.\u0027 \u0027Then let us see how long you can keep that light conversational tone. Light the brazier, Felmet,\u0027 snapped the duchess. \u0027Light the brazier, Fool,\u0027 said the duke. The Fool moved slowly. He hadn\u0027t expected any of this. Torturing people hadn\u0027t been on his mental agenda. Hurting old ladies in cold blood wasn\u0027t his cup of tea, and actually hurting witches in blood of any temperature whatsoever failed to be an entire twelve-course banquet. Words, he\u0027d said. All this probably came under the heading of sticks and stones. \u0027I don\u0027t like doing this,\u0027 he murmured under his breath. \u0027Fine,\u0027 said Nanny Ogg, whose hearing was superb. \u0027I\u0027ll remember that you didn\u0027t like it.\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wyrd-sisters-discworld-6/page-17.html","bookId":1625,"book":{"id":1625,"title":"Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6)","description":"Storyline: Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6) Witches are not by nature gregarious, and they certainly don\u0027t have leaders.
