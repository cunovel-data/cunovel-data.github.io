{"id":95584,"no":19,"title":"Page 19","content":"And she realised, in an absolutely clear way, that her padding had slipped down to her waist, her head felt as though a family of unhygienic birds had been nesting in it, and her eyeshadow had not so much run as sprinted. Her dress was torn in several places, her legs were scratched, her arms were bruised, and for some reason she felt on top of the world. \u0027I think you\u0027d better stand back, Verence,\u0027 she said. \u0027I\u0027m not sure how this is going to work.\u0027 There was a sharp intake of breath. \u0027How did you know my name?\u0027 Magrat sized up the door. The oak was old, centuries old, but she could sense just a little sap under a surface varnished by the years into something that was nearly as tough as stone. Normally what she had in mind would require a day\u0027s planning and a bagful of exotic ingredients. At least, so she\u0027d always believed. Now she was prepared to doubt it. If you could conjure demons out of washtubs, you could do anything. She became aware that the Fool had spoken. \u0027Oh, I expect I heard it somewhere,\u0027 she said vaguely. \u0027I shouldn\u0027t think so, I never use it,\u0027 said the Fool. \u0027I mean, it\u0027s not a popular name with the duke. It was me mam, you see. They like to name you after kings, I suppose. My grandad said I had no business having a name like that and he said I shouldn\u0027t go around—\u0027 Magrat nodded. She was looking around the dank tunnel with a professional\u0027s eye. It wasn\u0027t a promising place. The old oak planks had been down here in the darkness all these years, away from the clock of the seasons . . . On the other hand . . . Granny had said that somehow all trees were one tree, or something like that. Magrat thought she understood it, although she didn\u0027t know exactly what it meant. And it was springtime up there. The ghost of life that still lived in the wood must know that. Or if it had forgotten, it must be told. She put her palms flat on the door again and shut her eyes, tried to think her way out through the stone, out of the castle, and into the thin, black soil of the mountains, into the air, into the sunlight . . . The Fool was merely aware that Magrat was standing very still. Then her hair stood out from her head, gently, and there was a smell of leafmould. And then, without warning, the hammer that can drive a marshmallow-soft toadstool through six inches of solid pavement or an eel across a thousand miles of hostile ocean to a particular pond in an upland field, struck up through her and into the door. She stepped back carefully, her mind stunned, fighting against a desperate urge to bury her toes into the rock and put forth leaves. The Fool caught her, and the shock nearly knocked him over. Magrat sagged against the faintly jingling body, and felt triumphant. She had done it! And with no artificial aids! If only the others could have seen this . . . \u0027Don\u0027t go near it,\u0027 she mumbled. \u0027I think I gave it rather . . . a lot.\u0027 The Fool was still holding her toastrack body in his arms and was too overcome to utter a word, but she still got a reply. \u0027I reckon you did,\u0027 said Granny Weatherwax, stepping out of the shadows. \u0027I never would have thought of it myself.\u0027 Magrat peered at her. \u0027You\u0027ve been here all the time?\u0027 \u0027Just a few minutes.\u0027 Granny glanced at the door. \u0027Good technique,\u0027 she said, \u0027but it\u0027s old wood. Been in a fire, too, I reckon. Lot of iron nails and stuff in there. Can\u0027t see it working, I\u0027d have tried the stones if it was me, but—\u0027 She was interrupted by a soft \u0027pop\u0027. There was another, and then a whole series of them together, like a shower of meringues. Behind her, very gently, the door was breaking into leaf. Granny stared at it for a few seconds, and then met Magrat\u0027s terrified gaze. \u0027Run!\u0027 she yelled. They grabbed the Fool and scurried into the shelter of a convenient buttress. The door gave a warning creak. Several of its planks twisted in vegetable agony and there was a shower of rock splinters when nails were expelled like thorns from a wound, ricocheting off the stonework. The Fool ducked as part of the lock whirred over his head and smashed into the opposite wall. The lower parts of the planks extended questing white roots, which slithered across the damp stone to the nearest crack and began to auger in. Knotholes bulged, burst and thrust out branches which hit the stones of the doorway and tumbled them aside. And all the time there was a low groan, the sound of the cells of the wood trying to contain the surge of raw life pounding through them. \u0027If it had been me,\u0027 said Granny Weatherwax, as part of the ceiling caved in further along the passage, \u0027I wouldn\u0027t have done it like that. Not that I\u0027m objecting, mind you,\u0027 she said, as Magrat opened her mouth. \u0027It\u0027s a reasonable job. I think you might have overdone it a bit, that\u0027s all.\u0027 \u0027Excuse me,\u0027 said the Fool. \u0027I can\u0027t do rocks,\u0027 said Magrat. \u0027Well, no, rocks is an acquired taste—\u0027 \u0027Excuse me.\u0027 The two witches stared at him, and he backed away. \u0027Weren\u0027t you supposed to be rescuing someone?\u0027 he said. \u0027Oh,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027Yes. Come on, Magrat. We\u0027d better see what she\u0027s been getting up to.\u0027 \u0027There were screams,\u0027 said the Fool, who couldn\u0027t help feeling they weren\u0027t taking things seriously enough. \u0027I daresay,\u0027 said Granny, pushing him aside and stepping over a writhing taproot. \u0027If anyone locked me in a dungeon, there\u0027d be screams.\u0027 There was a lot of dust inside the dungeon, and by the nimbus of light around its one torch Magrat could dimly make out two figures cowering in the furthest corner. Most of the furniture had been overturned and scattered across the floor; it didn\u0027t look as though any of it had been designed to be the last word in comfort. Nanny Ogg was sitting quite calmly in what appeared to be a sort of stocks. \u0027Took your time,\u0027 she observed. \u0027Let me out of this, will you? I\u0027m getting cramp.\u0027 And there was the dagger. It spun gently in the middle of the room, glinting when the turning blade caught the light. \u0027My own dagger!\u0027 said the ghost of the king, in a voice only the witches could hear. \u0027All this time and I never knew it! My own dagger! They bloody well did me in with my own bloody knife!\u0027 He took another step towards the royal couple, waving the dagger. A faint gurgle escaped from the lips of the duke, glad to be out of there. \u0027He\u0027s doing well, isn\u0027t he,\u0027 said Nanny, as Magrat helped her out of her prison. \u0027Isn\u0027t that the old king? Can they see him?\u0027 \u0027Shouldn\u0027t think so.\u0027 King Verence staggered slightly under the weight. He was too old for such poltergeist activity; you had to be an adolescent for this . . . \u0027Let me just get a grip on this thing,\u0027 he said. \u0027Oh, damn . . .\u0027 The knife dropped from the ghost\u0027s tenuous grasp and clattered to the floor. Granny Weatherwax stepped forward smartly and put her foot on it. \u0027The dead shouldn\u0027t kill the living,\u0027 she said. \u0027It could be a dangerous wossname, precedent. We\u0027d all be outnumbered for one thing.\u0027 The duchess surfaced from her terror first. There had been knives swooping through the air and exploding doors, and now these women were defying her in her own dungeons. She couldn\u0027t be sure how she was supposed to react to the supernatural items, but she had very firm ideas about how she should tackle the last one. Her mouth opened like the gateway to a red hell. \u0027Guards!\u0027 she yelled, and spotted the Fool hovering near the door. \u0027Fool! Fetch the guards!\u0027 \u0027They\u0027re busy. We were just leaving,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027Which one of you is the duke?\u0027 Felmet stared pink-eyed up at her from his half-crouch in the corner. A thin dribble of saliva escaped from the corner of his mouth, and he giggled. Granny looked closer. In the centre of those streaming eyes something else looked back at her. \u0027I\u0027m going to give you no cause,\u0027 she said quietly. \u0027But it would be better for you if you left this country. Abdicate, or whatever.\u0027 \u0027In favour of whom?\u0027 said the duchess icily. \u0027A witch?\u0027 \u0027I won\u0027t,\u0027 said the duke. \u0027What did you say?\u0027 The duke pulled himself upright, brushed some of the dust off his clothes, and looked Granny full in the face. The coldness in the centre of his eyes was larger. \u0027I said I won\u0027t,\u0027 he said. \u0027Do you think a bit of simple conjuring would frighten me? I am the king by right of conquest, and you cannot change it. It is as simple as that, witch.\u0027 He moved closer. Granny stared at him. She hadn\u0027t faced anything like this before. The man was clearly mad, but at the heart of his madness was a dreadful cold sanity, a core of pure interstellar ice in the centre of the furnace. She\u0027d thought him weak under a thin shell of strength, but it went a lot further than that. Somewhere deep inside his mind, somewhere beyond the event horizon of rationality, the sheer pressure of insanity had hammered his madness into something harder than diamond. \u0027If you defeat me by magic, magic will rule,\u0027 said the duke. \u0027And you can\u0027t do it. And any king raised with your help would be under your power. Hag-ridden, I might say. That which magic rules, magic destroys. It would destroy you, too. You know it. Ha. Ha.\u0027 Granny\u0027s knuckles whitened as he moved closer. \u0027You could strike me down,\u0027 he said. \u0027And perhaps you could find someone to replace me. But he would have to be a fool indeed, because he would know he was under your evil eye, and if he mispleased you, why, his life would be instantly forfeit. You could protest all you wished, but he\u0027d know he ruled with your permission. And that would make him no king at all. Is this not true?\u0027 Granny looked away. The other witches hung back, ready to duck. \u0027I said, is this not true?\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027It is true . . .\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027. . . but there is one who could defeat you,\u0027 said Granny slowly. \u0027The child? Let him come when he is grown. A young man with a sword, seeking his destiny.\u0027 The duke sneered. \u0027Very romantic. But I have many years to prepare. Let him try.\u0027 Beside him King Verence\u0027s fist smashed through the air and quite failed to connect. The duke leaned closer until his nose was an inch from Granny\u0027s face. \u0027Get back to your cauldrons, wyrd sisters,\u0027 he said softly. Granny Weatherwax stalked through the passages of Lancre Castle like a large, angry bat, the duke\u0027s laughter echoing around her head. \u0027You could give him boils or something,\u0027 said Nanny Ogg. \u0027Haemorrhoids are good. That\u0027s allowed. It won\u0027t stop him ruling, it just means he\u0027ll have to rule standing up. Always good for a laugh, that. Or piles.\u0027 Granny Weatherwax said nothing. If fury were heat, her hat would have caught fire. \u0027Mind you, that\u0027d probably make him worse,\u0027 said Nanny, running to keep up. \u0027Same with toothache.\u0027 She gave a sideways glance at Granny\u0027s twitching features. \u0027You needn\u0027t fret,\u0027 she said. They didn\u0027t do anything much. But thanks, anyway.\u0027 \u0027I ain\u0027t worried about you, Gytha Ogg,\u0027 snapped Granny. \u0027I only come along \u0027cos Magrat was fretting. What I say is, if a witch can\u0027t look after herself, she\u0027s got no business calling herself a witch.\u0027 \u0027Magrat done well with the woodwork, I thought.\u0027 Even in the grip of her sullen fury, Granny Weatherwax spared a nod. \u0027She\u0027s coming along,\u0027 she said. She looked up and down the corridor, and then leaned closer to Nanny Ogg\u0027s ear. \u0027I ain\u0027t going to give him the pleasure of saying it,\u0027 she said, \u0027but he\u0027s got us beaten.\u0027 \u0027Well, I don\u0027t know,\u0027 said Nanny. \u0027Our Jason and a few sharp lads could soon—\u0027 \u0027You saw some of his guards. These aren\u0027t the old sort. These are a tough kind.\u0027 \u0027We could give the boys just a bit of help—\u0027 \u0027It wouldn\u0027t work. People have to sort this sort of thing out for themselves.\u0027 \u0027If you say so, Esme,\u0027 said Nanny meekly.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wyrd-sisters-discworld-6/page-19.html","bookId":1625,"book":{"id":1625,"title":"Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6)","description":"Storyline: Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6) Witches are not by nature gregarious, and they certainly don\u0027t have leaders.
