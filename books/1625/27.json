{"id":95592,"no":27,"title":"Page 27","content":"\u0027Damn thing hasn\u0027t even got a name,\u0027 Vitoller had said. \u0027I should call it the Golde Mine, because that\u0027s what it\u0027s costing me. Where\u0027s the money going to come from, that\u0027s what I\u0027d like to know.\u0027\\n\\n In fact they\u0027d tried a lot of names, none of which suited Tomjon.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s got to be a name that means everything,\u0027 he said. \u0027Because there\u0027s everything inside it. The whole world on the stage, do you see?\u0027\\n\\n And Hwel had said, knowing as he said it that what he was saying was exactly right, \u0027The Disc.\u0027\\n\\n And now the Dysk was nearly done, and still he hadn\u0027t written the new play.\\n\\n He shut the window and wandered back to his desk, picked up the quill, and pulled another sheet of paper towards him. A thought struck him. The whole world was a stage, to the gods . . .\\n\\n Presently he began to write.\\n\\n All the Disc it is but an Theater, he wrote, Aite alle men and wymmen are but Players. He made the mistake of pausing, and another inspiration sleeted down, sending his train of thought off along an entirely new track.\\n\\n He looked at what he had written and added: Except Those who selle popcorn.\\n\\n After a while he crossed this out, and tried: Like unto thee Staje of a Theater ys the World, whereon alle Persons strut as Players.\\n\\n This seemed a bit better.\\n\\n He thought for a bit, and continued conscientiously: Sometimes they walke on. Sometimes they walke off.\\n\\n He seemed to be losing it. Time, time, what he needed was an infinity . . .\\n\\n There was a muffled cry and a thump from the next room. Hwel dropped the quill and pushed open the door cautiously.\\n\\n The boy was sitting up in bed, white-faced. He relaxed when Hwel came in.\\n\\n \u0027Hwel?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s up, lad? Nightmares?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Gods, it was terrible! I saw them again! I really thought for a minute that—\u0027\\n\\n Hwel, who was absent-mindedly picking up the clothes that Tomjon had strewn around the room, paused in his work. He was keen on dreams. That was when the ideas came.\\n\\n \u0027That what?\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027It was like . . . I mean, I was sort of inside something, like a bowl, and there were these three terrible faces peering in at me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Aye?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, and then they all said, “All hail . . .” and then they started arguing about my name, and then they said, “Anyway, who shall be king hereafter?” And then one of them said, “Here after what?” and one of the other two said, “Just hereafter, girl, it\u0027s what you\u0027re supposed to say in these circumstances, you might try and make an effort”, and then they all peered closer, and one of the others said, “He looks a bit peaky, I reckon it\u0027s all that foreign food”, and then the youngest one said, “Nanny, I\u0027ve told you already, there\u0027s no such place as Thespia”, and then they bickered a bit, and one of the old ones said, “He can\u0027t hear us, can he? He\u0027s tossing and turning a bit”, and the other one said, “You know I\u0027ve never been able to get sound on this thing, Esme”, and then they bickered some more, and it went cloudy, and then . . . I woke up . . .\u0027 he finished lamely. \u0027It was horrible, because every time they came close to the bowl it sort of magnified everything, so all you could see was eyes and nostrils.\u0027\\n\\n Hwel hoisted himself on to the edge of the narrow bed.\\n\\n \u0027Funny old things, dreams,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027Not much funny about that one.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, but I mean, last night, I had this dream about a little bandy-legged man walking down a road,\u0027 said Hwel. \u0027He had a little black hat on, and he walked as though his boots were full of water.\u0027\\n\\n Tomjon nodded politely.\\n\\n \u0027Yes?\u0027 he said. \u0027And—?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, that was it. And nothing. He had this little cane which he twirled and, you know, it was incredibly . . .\u0027\\n\\n The dwarfs voice trailed off. Tomjon\u0027s face had that familiar expression of polite and slightly condescending puzzlement that Hwel had come to know and dread.\\n\\n \u0027Anyway, it was very amusing,\u0027 he said, half to himself. But he knew he\u0027d never convince the rest of the company. If it didn\u0027t have a custard pie in it somewhere, they said, it wasn\u0027t funny.\\n\\n Tomjon swung his legs out of bed and reached for his britches.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m not going back to sleep,\u0027 he said. \u0027What\u0027s the time?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s after midnight,\u0027 said Hwel. \u0027And you know what your father said about going to bed late.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m not,\u0027 said Tomjon, pulling on his boots. Tm getting up early. Getting up early is very healthy. And now I\u0027m going out for a very healthy drink. You can come too,\u0027 he added, \u0027to keep an eye on me.\u0027\\n\\n Hwel gave him a doubting look.\\n\\n \u0027You also know what your father says about going out drinking,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027Yes. He said he used to do it all the time when he was a lad. He said he\u0027d think nothing of quaffing ale all night and coming home at 5 a.m., smashing windows. He said he was a bit of a roister-doister, not like these white-livered people today who can\u0027t hold their drink.\u0027 Tomjon adjusted his doublet in front of the mirror, and added, \u0027You know, Hwel, I reckon responsible behaviour is something to get when you grow older. Like varicose veins.\u0027\\n\\n Hwel sighed. Tomjon\u0027s memory for ill-judged remarks was legendary.\\n\\n \u0027All right,\u0027 he said. \u0027Just the one, though. Somewhere decent.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I promise.\u0027 Tomjon adjusted his hat. It had a feather in it.\\n\\n \u0027By the way,\u0027 he said, \u0027exactly how does one quaff?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I think it means you spill most of it,\u0027 said Hwel.\\n\\n If the water of the river Ankh was rather thicker and more full of personality than ordinary river water, so the air in the Mended Drum was more crowded than normal air. It was like dry fog.\\n\\n Tomjon and Hwel watched it spilling out into the street. The door burst open and a man came through backwards, not actually touching the ground until he hit the wall on the opposite side of the street.\\n\\n An enormous troll, employed by the owners to keep a measure of order in the place, came out dragging two more limp bodies which he deposited on the cobbles, kicking them once or twice in soft places.\\n\\n \u0027I reckon they\u0027re roistering in there, don\u0027t you?\u0027 said Tomjon.\\n\\n \u0027It looks like it,\u0027 said Hwel. He shivered. He hated taverns. People always put their drinks down on his head.\\n\\n They scurried in quickly while the troll was holding one unconscious drinker up by one leg and banging his head on the cobbles in a search for concealed valuables.\\n\\n Drinking in the Drum has been likened to diving in a swamp, except that in a swamp the alligators don\u0027t pick your pockets first. Two hundred eyes watched the pair as they pushed their way through the crowd to the bar, a hundred mouths paused in the act of drinking, cursing or pleading, and ninety-nine brows crinkled with the effort of working out whether the newcomers fell into category A, people to be frightened of or B, people to frighten.\\n\\n Tomjon walked through the crowd as though it was his property and, with the impetuosity of youth, rapped on the bar. Impetuosity was not a survival trait in the Mended Drum.\\n\\n \u0027Two pints of your finest ale, landlord,\u0027 he said, in tones so carefully judged that the barman was astonished to find himself obediently filling the first mug before the echoes had died away.\\n\\n Hwel looked up. There was an extremely big man on his right, wearing the outside of several large bulls and more chains than necessary to moor a warship. A face that looked like a building site with hair on it glared down at him.\\n\\n \u0027Bloody hell,\u0027 it said. \u0027It\u0027s a bloody lawn ornament.\u0027\\n\\n Hwel went cold. Cosmopolitan as they were, the people of Morpork had a breezy, no-nonsense approach to the non-human races, i.e., hit them over the head with a brick and throw them in the river. This did not apply to trolls, naturally, because it is very difficult to be racially prejudiced against creatures seven feet tall who can bite through walls, at least for very long. But people three feet high were absolutely designed to be discriminated against.\\n\\n The giant prodded Hwel on the top of his head.\\n\\n \u0027Where\u0027s your fishing rod, lawn ornament?\u0027 he said.\\n\\n The barman pushed the mugs across the puddled counter.\\n\\n \u0027Here you are,\u0027 he said, leering. \u0027One pint. And one half pint.\u0027\\n\\n Tomjon opened his mouth to speak, but Hwel nudged him sharply in the knee. Put up with it, put up with it, slip out as soon as possible, it was the only way . . .\\n\\n \u0027Where\u0027s your little pointy hat, then?\u0027 said the bearded man.\\n\\n The room had gone quiet. This looked like being cabaret time.\\n\\n \u0027I said, where\u0027s your pointy hat, dopey?\u0027\\n\\n The barman got a grip of the blackthorn stick with nails in which lived under the counter, just in case, and said, \u0027Er—\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I was talking to the lawn ornament here.\u0027\\n\\n The man took the dregs of his own drink and poured them carefully over the silent dwarfs head.\\n\\n \u0027I ain\u0027t drinking here again,\u0027 he muttered, when even this tailed to have any effect. \u0027It\u0027s bad enough they let monkeys drink here, but pygmies—\u0027\\n\\n Now the silence in the bar took on a whole new intensity in which the sound of a stool being slowly pushed back was like the creak of doom. All eyes swivelled to the other end of the room, where sat the one drinker in the Mended Drum who came into category C.\\n\\n What Tomjon had thought was an old sack hunched over the bar was extending arms and – other arms, except that they were its legs. A sad, rubbery face turned towards the speaker, its expression as melancholy as the mists of evolution. Its funny lips curled back. There was abolutely nothing funny about its teeth.\\n\\n \u0027Er,\u0027 said the barman again, his voice frightening even him in that terrible simian silence. \u0027I don\u0027t think you meant that, did you? Not about monkeys, eh? You didn\u0027t really, did you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What the hell\u0027s that?\u0027 hissed Tomjon.\\n\\n \u0027I think it\u0027s an orang-utan,\u0027 said Hwel. \u0027An ape.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A monkey\u0027s a monkey,\u0027 said the bearded man, at which several of the Drum\u0027s more percipient customers started to edge for the door. \u0027I mean, so what? But these bloody lawn ornaments—\u0027\\n\\n Hwel\u0027s fist struck out at groin height.\\n\\n Dwarfs have a reputation as fearsome fighters. Any race of three-foot tall people who favour axes and go into battle as into a championship tree-felling competition soon get talked about. But years of wielding a pen instead of a hammer had relieved Hwel\u0027s punches of some of their stopping power, and it could have been the end of him when the big man yelled and drew his sword if a pair of delicate, leathery hands hadn\u0027t instantly jerked the thing from his grip and, with only a small amount of effort, bent it double.[16]\\n\\n When the giant growled, and turned around, an arm like a couple of broom handles strung together with elastic and covered with red fur unfolded itself in a complicated motion and smacked him across the jaw so hard that he rose several inches in the air and landed on a table.\\n\\n By the time that the table had slid into another table and overturned a couple of benches there was enough impetus to start the night\u0027s overdue brawl, especially since the big man had a few friends with him. Since no-one felt like attacking the ape, who had dreamily pulled a bottle from the shelf and smashed the bottom off on the counter, they hit whoever happened to be nearest, on general principles. This is absolutely correct etiquette for a tavern brawl.\\n\\n Hwel walked under a table and dragged Tomjon, who was watching all this with interest, after him.\\n\\n \u0027So this is roistering. I always wondered.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I think perhaps it would be a good idea to leave,\u0027 said the dwarf firmly. \u0027Before there\u0027s, you know, any trouble.\u0027\\n\\n There was a thump as someone landed on the table above them, and a tinkle of broken glass.\\n\\n \u0027Is it real roistering, do you suppose, or merely rollicking?\u0027 said Tomjon, grinning.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s going to be bloody murder in a minute, my lad!\u0027\\n\\n Tomjon nodded, and crawled back out into the fray. Hwel heard him thump on the bar counter with something and call for silence. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wyrd-sisters-discworld-6/page-27.html","bookId":1625,"book":{"id":1625,"title":"Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6)","description":"Storyline: Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6) \\n Witches are not by nature gregarious, and they certainly don\u0027t have leaders.
