{"id":95569,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"The Fool hesitated with a card in his hand, suppressed his panic and thought quickly.\n \u0027I\u0027faith, nuncle,\u0027 he squeaked, \u0027thou\u0027t more full of questions than a martlebury is of mizzensails.\u0027\n The cook relaxed.\n \u0027Well, okay,\u0027 he said, not entirely satisfied. The Fool lost the next three hands, just to be on the safe side.\n The porter, meanwhile, unfastened the hatch in the wicket gate and peered out.\n \u0027Who dost knock without?\u0027 he growled.\n The soldier, drenched and terrified though he was, hesitated.\n \u0027Without? Without what?\u0027 he said.\n \u0027If you\u0027re going to bugger about, you can bloody well stay without all day,\u0027 said the porter calmly.\n \u0027No! I must see the duke upon the instant!\u0027 shouted the guard. \u0027Witches are abroad!\u0027\n The porter was about to come back with, \u0027Good time of year for it\u0027, or \u0027Wish I was, too\u0027, but stopped when he saw the man\u0027s face. It wasn\u0027t the face of a man who would enter into the spirit of the thing. It was the look of someone who had seen things a decent man shouldn\u0027t wot of . . .\n \u0027Witches?\u0027 said Lord Felmet. \u0027Witches!\u0027 said the duchess.\n In the draughty corridors, a voice as faint as the wind in distant keyholes said, with a note of hope, \u0027Witches!\u0027\n The psychically inclined . . .\n \u0027It\u0027s meddling, that\u0027s what it is,\u0027 said Granny Weatherwax. \u0027And no good will come of it.\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s very romantic,\u0027 said Magrat breathily, and heaved a sigh.\n \u0027Goochy goo,\u0027 said Nanny Ogg.\n \u0027Anyway,\u0027 said Magrat, \u0027you killed that horrid man!\u0027\n \u0027I never did. I just encouraged . . . things to take their course.\u0027 Granny Weatherwax frowned. \u0027He didn\u0027t have no respect. Once people lose their respect, it means trouble.\u0027\n \u0027Izzy wizzy wazzy, den.\u0027 ,\n \u0027That other man brought him out here to save him!\u0027 shouted Magrat. \u0027He wanted us to keep him safe! It\u0027s obvious! It\u0027s destiny!\u0027\n \u0027Oh, obvious,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027I\u0027ll grant you it\u0027s obvious. Trouble is, just because things are obvious doesn\u0027t mean they\u0027re true.\u0027\n She weighed the crown in her hands. It felt very heavy, in a way that went beyond mere pounds and ounces.\n \u0027Yes, but the point is—\u0027 Magrat began.\n \u0027The point is,\u0027 said Granny, \u0027that people are going to come looking. Serious people. Serious looking. Pull-down-the-walls and burn-off-the-thatch looking. And—\u0027\n \u0027Howsa boy, den?\u0027\n \u0027—And, Gytha , I\u0027m sure we\u0027ll all be a lot happier if you\u0027d stop gurgling like that!\u0027 Granny snapped. She could feel her nerves coming on. Her nerves always played up when she was unsure about things. Besides, they had retired to Magrat\u0027s cottage, and the decor was getting to her, because Magrat believed in Nature\u0027s wisdom and elves and the healing power of colours and the cycle of the seasons and a lot of other things Granny Weatherwax didn\u0027t have any truck with.\n \u0027You\u0027re not after telling me how to look after a child,\u0027 snapped Nanny Ogg mildly. \u0027And me with fifteen of my own?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m just saying that we ought to think about it,\u0027 said Granny.\n The other two watched her for some time. \u0027Well?\u0027 said Magrat.\n Granny\u0027s fingers drummed on the edge of the crown. She frowned.\n \u0027First, we\u0027ve got to take him away from here,\u0027 she said, and held up a hand. \u0027No, Gytha, I\u0027m sure your cottage is ideal and everything, but it\u0027s not safe. He\u0027s got to be somewhere away from here, a long way away, where no-one knows who he is. And then there\u0027s this.\u0027 She tossed the crown from hand to hand.\n \u0027Oh, that\u0027s easy,\u0027 said Magrat. \u0027I mean, you just hide it under a stone or something. That\u0027s easy. Much easier than babies.\u0027\n \u0027It ain\u0027t,\u0027 said Granny. The reason being, the country\u0027s full of babies and they all look the same, but I don\u0027t reckon there\u0027s many crowns. They have this way of being found, anyway. They kind of call out to people\u0027s minds. If you bunged it under a stone up here, in a week\u0027s time it\u0027d get itself discovered by accident. You mark my words.\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s true, is that,\u0027 said Nanny Ogg, earnestly. \u0027How many times have you thrown a magic ring into the deepest depths of the ocean and then, when you get home and have a nice bit of turbot for your tea, there it is?\u0027\n They considered this in silence.\n \u0027Never,\u0027 said Granny irritably. \u0027And nor have you. Anyway, he might want it back. If it\u0027s rightfully his, that is. Kings set a lot of store by crowns. Really, Gytha, sometimes you say the most—\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ll just make some tea, shall I?\u0027 said Magrat brightly, and disappeared into the scullery.\n The two elderly witches sat on either side of the table in polite and prickly silence. Finally Nanny Ogg said, \u0027She done it up nice, hasn\u0027t she? Flowers and everything. What are them things on the walls?\u0027\n \u0027Sigils,\u0027 said Granny sourly. \u0027Or some such.\u0027\n \u0027Fancy,\u0027 said Nanny Ogg, politely. \u0027And all them robes and wands and things too.\u0027\n \u0027Modern,\u0027 said Granny Weatherwax, with a sniff. \u0027When I was a gel, we had a lump of wax and a couple of pins and had to be content. We had to make our own enchantment in them days.\u0027\n \u0027Ah, well, we\u0027ve all passed a lot of water since then,\u0027 said Nanny Ogg sagely. She gave the baby a comforting jiggle.\n Granny Weatherwax sniffed. Nanny Ogg had been married three times and ruled a tribe of children and grandchildren all over the kingdom. Certainly, it was not actually forbidden for witches to get married. Granny had to concede that, but reluctantly. Very reluctantly. She sniffed again, disapprovingly; this was a mistake.\n \u0027What\u0027s that smell?\u0027 she snapped.\n \u0027Ah,\u0027 said Nanny Ogg, carefully repositioning the baby. \u0027I expect I\u0027ll just go and see if Magrat has any clean rags, shall I?\u0027\n And now Granny was left alone. She felt embarrassed, as one always does when left alone in someone else\u0027s room, and fought the urge to get up and inspect the books on the shelf over the sideboard or examine the mantelpiece for dust. She turned the crown round and round in her hands. Again, it gave the impression of being bigger and heavier than it actually was.\n She caught sight of the mirror over the mantelpiece and looked down at the crown. It was tempting. It was practically begging her to try it for size. Well, and why not? She made sure that the others weren\u0027t around and then, in one movement, whipped off her hat and placed the crown on her head.\n It seemed to fit. Granny drew herself up proudly, and waved a hand imperiously in the general direction of the hearth.\n \u0027Jolly well do this,\u0027 she said. She beckoned arrogantly at the grandfather clock. \u0027Chop his head off, what ho,\u0027 she commanded. She smiled grimly.\n And froze as she heard the screams, and the thunder of horses, and the deadly whisper of arrows and the damp, solid sound of spears in flesh. Charge after charge echoed across her skull. Sword met shield, or sword, or bone -relentlessly. Years streamed across her mind in the space of a second. There were times when she lay among the dead, or hanging from the branch of a tree; but always there were hands that would pick her up again, and place her on a velvet cushion . . .\n Granny very carefully lifted the crown off her head – it was an effort, it didn\u0027t like it much – and laid it on the table.\n \u0027So that\u0027s being a king for you, is it?\u0027 she said softly. \u0027I wonder why they all want the job?\u0027\n \u0027Do you take sugar?\u0027 said Magrat, behind her.\n \u0027You\u0027d have to be a born fool to be a king,\u0027 said Granny.\n \u0027Sorry?\u0027\n Granny turned. \u0027Didn\u0027t see you come in,\u0027 she said. \u0027What was it you said?\u0027\n \u0027Sugar in your tea?\u0027\n \u0027Three spoons,\u0027 said Granny promptly. It was one of the few sorrows of Granny Weatherwax\u0027s life that, despite all her efforts, she\u0027d arrived at the peak of her career with a complexion like a rosy apple and all her teeth. No amount of charms could persuade a wart to take root on her handsome if slightly equine features, and vast intakes of sugar only served to give her boundless energy. A wizard she\u0027d consulted had explained it was on account of her having a metabolism, which at least allowed her to feel vaguely superior to Nanny Ogg, who she suspected had never even seen one.\n Magrat dutifully dug out three heaped ones. It would be nice, she thought wistfully, if someone could say \u0027thank you\u0027 occasionally.\n She became aware that the crown was staring at her.\n \u0027You can feel it, can you?\u0027 said Granny. \u0027I said, didn\u0027t I? Crowns call out!\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s horrible.\u0027\n \u0027No, no. It\u0027s just being what it is. It can\u0027t help it.\u0027\n \u0027But it\u0027s magic!\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s just being what it is,\u0027 Granny repeated.\n \u0027It\u0027s trying to get me to try it on,\u0027 said Magrat, her hand hovering.\n \u0027It does that, yes.\u0027\n \u0027But I shall be strong,\u0027 said Magrat.\n \u0027So I should think,\u0027 said Granny, her expression suddenly curiously wooden. \u0027What\u0027s Gytha doing?\u0027\n \u0027She\u0027s giving the baby a wash in the sink,\u0027 said Magrat vaguely. \u0027How can we hide something like this? What\u0027d happen if we buried it really deeply somewhere?\u0027\n \u0027A badger\u0027d dig it up,\u0027 said Granny wearily. \u0027Or someone\u0027d go prospecting for gold or something. Or a tree\u0027d tangle its roots around it and then be blown over in a storm, and then someone\u0027d pick it up and put it on—\u0027\n \u0027Unless they were as strong-minded as us,\u0027 Magrat pointed out.\n \u0027Unless that, of course,\u0027 said Granny, staring at her finger-nails. Though the thing with crowns is, it isn\u0027t the putting them on that\u0027s the problem, it\u0027s the taking them off.\u0027\n Magrat picked it up and turned it over in her hands.\n \u0027It\u0027s not as though it even looks much like a crown,\u0027 she said.\n \u0027You\u0027ve seen a lot, I expect,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027You\u0027d be an expert on them, naturally.\u0027\n \u0027Seen a fair few. They\u0027ve got a lot more jewels on them, and cloth bits in the middle,\u0027 said Magrat defiantly. \u0027This is just a thin little thing—\u0027\n \u0027Magrat Garlick!\u0027\n \u0027I have. When I was being trained up by Goodie Whemper—\u0027\n \u0027—may sherestinpeace—\u0027\n \u0027—maysherestinpeace, she used to take me over to Razorback or into Lancre whenever the strolling players were in town. She was very keen on the theatre. They\u0027ve got more crowns than you can shake a stick at although, mind—\u0027 she paused – \u0027Goodie did say they\u0027re made of tin and paper and stuff. And just glass for the jewels. But they look more realler than this one. Do you think that\u0027s strange?\u0027\n \u0027Things that try to look like things often do look more like things than things. Well-known fact,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027But I don\u0027t hold with encouraging it. What do they stroll about playing, then, in these crowns?\u0027\n \u0027You don\u0027t know about the theatre?\u0027 said Magrat.\n Granny Weatherwax, who never declared her ignorance of anything, didn\u0027t hesitate. \u0027Oh, yes,\u0027 she said. \u0027It\u0027s one of them style of things, then, is it?\u0027\n \u0027Goodie Whemper said it held a mirror up to life,\u0027 said Magrat. \u0027She said it always cheered her up.\u0027\n \u0027I expect it would,\u0027 said Granny, striking out. \u0027Played properly, at any rate. Good people, are they, these theatre players?\u0027\n \u0027I think so.\u0027\n \u0027And they stroll around the country, you say?\u0027 said Granny thoughtfully, looking towards the scullery door.\n \u0027All over the place. There\u0027s a troupe in Lancre now, I heard. I haven\u0027t been because, you know.\u0027 Magrat looked down. \u0027 \u0027Tis not right, a woman going into such places by herself.\u0027\n Granny nodded. She thoroughly approved of such sentiments so long as there was, of course, no suggestion that they applied to her.\n She drummed her fingers on Magrat\u0027s tablecloth.\n \u0027Right,\u0027 she said. \u0027And why not? Go and tell Gytha to wrap the baby up well. It\u0027s a long time since I heard a theatre played properly.\u0027\n Magrat was entranced, as usual. The theatre was no more than some lengths of painted sacking, a plank stage laid over a few barrels, and half a dozen benches set out in the village square. But at the same time it had also managed to become The Castle, Another Part of the Castle, The Same Part A Little Later, The Battlefield and now it was A Road Outside the City. The afternoon would have been perfect if it wasn\u0027t for Granny Weatherwax. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wyrd-sisters-discworld-6/page-4.html","bookId":1625,"book":{"id":1625,"title":"Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6)","description":"Storyline: \n Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6) \n Witches are not by nature gregarious, and they certainly don\u0027t have leaders.
