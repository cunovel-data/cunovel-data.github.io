Not for me. Not for the goddam captain.\u0027 He shifted the butt of an imaginary cigar from one side of his mouth to the other, and pushed back a non-existent tin helmet, and rasped, \u0027But for Corporal Walkowski and his little dawg.\u0027 They stared at him in disbelief. On cue, someone shook a sheet of tin and broke the spell. Hwel rolled his eyes. He\u0027d grown up in the mountains, where thunderstorms stalked from peak to peak on legs of lightning. He remembered thunderstorms that left mountains a different shape and flattened whole forests. Somehow, a sheet of tin wasn\u0027t the same, no matter how enthusiastically it was shaken. Just once, he thought, just once. Let me get it right just once. He opened his eyes and glared at the witches. \u0027What are you hanging around here for?\u0027 he yelled. \u0027Get out there and curse them!\u0027 He watched them scamper on to the stage, and then Tomjon tapped him on the head. \u0027Hwel, there\u0027s no crown.\u0027 \u0027Hmm?\u0027 said the dwarf, his mind wrestling with ways of building thunder-and-lightning machines. \u0027There\u0027s no crown, Hwel. I\u0027ve got to wear a crown.\u0027 \u0027Of course there\u0027s a crown. The big one with the red glass, very impressive, we used it in that place with the big square—\u0027 \u0027I think we left it there.\u0027 There was another tinny roll of thunder but, even so, the part of Hwel that was living the play heard a faltering voice on stage. He darted to the wings. \u0027—I have smother\u0027d many a babe—\u0027 he hissed, and sprinted back. \u0027Well, just find another one, then,\u0027 he said vaguely. \u0027In the props box. You\u0027re the Evil King, you\u0027ve got to have a crown. Get on with it, lad, you\u0027re on in a few minutes. Improvise.\u0027 Tomjon wandered back to the box. He\u0027d grown up among crowns, big golden crowns made of wood and plaster, studded with finest glass. He\u0027d cut his teeth on the hat-brims of Authority. But most of them had been left in the Dysk now. He pulled out collapsible daggers and skulls and vases, the strata of the years and, right at the bottom, his fingers closed on something thin and crown shaped, which no-one had ever wanted to wear because it looked so uncrownly. It would be nice to say it tingled under his hand. Perhaps it did. Granny was sitting as still as a statue, and almost as cold. The horror of realisation was stealing over her. \u0027That\u0027s us,\u0027 she said. \u0027Round that silly cauldron. That\u0027s meant to be us, Gytha.\u0027 Nanny Ogg paused with a walnut halfway to her gums. She listened to the words. \u0027I never shipwrecked anybody!\u0027 she said. \u0027They just said they shipwreck people! I never did!\u0027 Up in the tower Magrat elbowed the Fool in the ribs. \u0027Green blusher,\u0027 she said, staring at the 3rd Witche. \u0027I don\u0027t look like that. I don\u0027t, do I?\u0027 \u0027Absolutely not,\u0027 said the Fool. \u0027And that hair!\u0027 The Fool peered through the crenellations like an over-eager gargoyle. \u0027It looks like straw,\u0027 he said. \u0027Not very clean, either.\u0027 He hesitated, picking at the lichened stonework with his fingers; Before he\u0027d left the city he\u0027d asked Hwel for a few suitable words to say to a young lady, and he had been memorising them on the way home. It was now or never. \u0027I\u0027d like to know if I could compare you to a summer\u0027s day. Because – well, June 12th was quite nice, and . . .Oh. You\u0027ve gone . . .\u0027 King Verence gripped the edge of his seat; his fingers went through it. Tomjon had strutted on to the stage. \u0027That\u0027s him, isn\u0027t it? That\u0027s my son?\u0027 The uncracked walnut fell from Nanny Ogg\u0027s fingers and rolled on to the floor. She nodded. Verence turned a haggard, transparent face towards her. \u0027But what is he doing? What is he saying?\u0027 Nanny shook her head. The king listened with his mouth open as Tomjon, lurching crabwise across the stage, launched into his major speech. \u0027I think he\u0027s meant to be you,\u0027 said Nanny, distantly. \u0027But I never walked like that! Why\u0027s he got a hump on his back? What\u0027s happened to his leg?\u0027 He listened some more, and added, in horrified tones, \u0027And I certainly never did that! Or that. Why is he saying I did that?\u0027 The look he gave Nanny was full of pleading. She shrugged. The king reached up, lifted off his spectral crown, and examined it. \u0027And it\u0027s my crown he\u0027s wearing! Look, this is it! And he\u0027s saying I did all those—\u0027 He paused for a minute, to listen to the latest couplet, and added, \u0027All right. Maybe I did that. So I set fire to a few cottages. But everyone does that. It\u0027s good for the building industry, anyway.\u0027 He put the ghostly crown back on his head. \u0027Why\u0027s he saying all this about me?\u0027 he pleaded. \u0027It\u0027s art,\u0027 said Nanny. \u0027It wossname, holds a mirror up to life.\u0027 Granny turned slowly in her seat to look at the audience. They were staring at the performance, their faces rapt. The words washed over them in the breathless air. This was real. This was more real even than reality. This was history. It might not be true, but that had nothing to do with it. Granny had never had much time for words. They were so insubstantial. Now she wished that she had found the time. Words were indeed insubstantial. They were as soft as water, but they were also as powerful as water and now they were rushing over the audience, eroding the levees of veracity, and carrying away the past. That\u0027s us down there, she thought. Everyone knows who we really are, but the things down there are what they\u0027ll remember – three gibbering old baggages in pointy hats. All we\u0027ve ever done, all we\u0027ve ever been, won\u0027t exist any more. She looked at the ghost of the king. Well, he\u0027d been no worse than any other king. Oh, he might burn down the odd cottage every now and again, in a sort of absent-minded way, but only when he was really angry about something, and he could give it up any time he liked. Where he wounded the world, he left the kind of wounds that healed. Whoever wrote this Theatre knew about the uses of magic. Even I believe what\u0027s happening, and I know there\u0027s no truth in it. This is Art holding a Mirror up to Life. That\u0027s why everything is exactly the wrong way round. We\u0027ve lost. There is nothing we can do against this without becoming exactly what we aren\u0027t. Nanny Ogg gave her a violent nudge in the ribs. \u0027Did you hear that?\u0027 she said. \u0027One of \u0027em said we put babbies in the cauldron! They\u0027ve done a slander on me! I\u0027m not sitting here and have \u0027em say we put babbies in a cauldron!\u0027 Granny grabbed her shawl as she tried to stand up. \u0027Don\u0027t do anything!\u0027 she hissed. \u0027It\u0027ll make things worse.\u0027 \u0027 “Ditch-delivered by adrabe”, they said. That\u0027ll be young Millie Hipwood, who didn\u0027t dare tell her mum and then went out gathering firewood. I was up all night with that one,\u0027 Nanny muttered. \u0027Fine girl she produced. It\u0027s a slander! What\u0027s a drabe?\u0027 she added. \u0027Words,\u0027 said Granny, half to herself. \u0027That\u0027s all that\u0027s left. Words.\u0027 \u0027And now there\u0027s a man with a trumpet come on. What\u0027s he going to do? Oh. End of Act One,\u0027 said Nanny. The words won\u0027t be forgotten, thought Granny. They\u0027ve got a power to them. They\u0027re damn good words, as words go. There was yet another rattle of thunder, which ended with the kind of crash made, for example, by a sheet of tin escaping from someone\u0027s hands and hitting the wall. In the world outside the stage the heat pressed down like a pillow, squeezing the very life out of the air. Granny saw a footman bend down to the duke\u0027s ear. No, he won\u0027t stop the play. Of course he won\u0027t. He wants it to run its course. The duke must have felt the heat of her gaze on the back of his neck. He turned, focused on her, and gave her a strange little smile. Then he nudged his wife. They both laughed. Granny Weatherwax was often angry. She considered it one of her strong points. Genuine anger was one of the world\u0027s great creative forces. But you had to learn how to control it. That didn\u0027t mean you let it trickle away. It meant you dammed it, carefully, let it develop a working head, let it drown whole valleys of the mind and then, just when the whole structure was about to collapse, opened a tiny pipeline at the base and let the iron-hard stream of wrath power the turbines of revenge. She felt the land below her, even through several feet of foundations, flagstones, one thickness of leather and two thicknesses of sock. She felt it waiting. She heard the king say, \u0027My own flesh and blood? Why has he done this to me? I\u0027m going to confront him!\u0027 She gently took Nanny Ogg\u0027s hand. \u0027Come, Gytha,\u0027 she said. Lord Felmet sat back in his throne and beamed madly at the world, which was looking good right at the moment. Things were working out better than he had dared to hope. He could feel the past melting behind him, like ice in the spring thaw. On an impulse he called the footman back. \u0027Call the captain of the guard,\u0027 he said, \u0027and tell him to find the witches and arrest them.\u0027 The duchess snorted. \u0027Remember what happened last time, foolish man?\u0027 \u0027We left two of them loose,\u0027 said the duke. \u0027This time . . . all three. The tide of public feeling is on our side. That sort of thing affects witches, depend upon it.\u0027 The duchess cracked her knuckles to indicate her view of public opinion. \u0027You must admit, my treasure, that the experiment seems to be working.\u0027 \u0027It would appear so.\u0027 \u0027Very well. Don\u0027t just stand there, man. Before the play ends, tell him. Those witches are to be under lock and key.\u0027 Death adjusted his cardboard skull in front of the mirror, twitched his cowl into a suitable shape, stood back and considered the general effect. It was going to be his first speaking part. He wanted to get it right. \u0027Cower now, Brief Mortals,\u0027 he said. \u0027For I am Death, \u0027Gainst Whom No . . . no . . . no . . . Hwel, \u0027gainst whom no?\u0027 \u0027Oh, good grief, Dafe. “ \u0027Gainst whom no lock will hold nor fasten\u0027d portal bar”, I really don\u0027t see why you have difficulty with . . . not that way up, you idiots!\u0027 Hwel strode off through the backstage melee in pursuit of a pair of importunate scene shifters. \u0027Right,\u0027 said Death, to no-one in particular. He turned back to the mirror. \u0027 \u0027Gainst Whom No . . . Tumpty-Tum . . . nor Tumpty-Tumpty bar,\u0027 he said, uncertainly, and flourished his scythe. The end fell off. \u0027Do you think I\u0027m fearsome enough?\u0027 he said, as he tried to fix it on again. Tomjon, who was sitting on his hump and trying to drink some tea, gave him an encouraging nod. \u0027No problem, my friend,\u0027 he said. \u0027Compared to a visit from you, even Death himself would hold no fears. But you could try a bit more hollowness.\u0027 \u0027How d\u0027you mean?\u0027 Tomjon put down his cup. Shadows seemed to move across his face; his eyes sank, his lips drew back from his teeth, his skin stretched and paled. \u0027I HAVE COME TO GET YOU, YOU TERRIBLE ACTOR,\u0027 he intoned, each syllable falling into place like a coffin lid. His features sprang back into shape. \u0027Like that,\u0027 he said. Dafe, who had flattened himself against the wall, relaxed a bit and gave a nervous giggle. \u0027Gods, I don\u0027t know how you do it,\u0027 he said. \u0027Honestly, I\u0027ll never be as good as you.\u0027 \u0027There really isn\u0027t anything to it. Now run along, Hwel\u0027s fit to be tied as it is.\u0027 Dafe gave him a look of gratitude and ran off to help with the scene shifting.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wyrd-sisters-discworld-6/page-35.html","bookId":1625,"book":{"id":1625,"title":"Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6)","description":"Storyline: Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6) Witches are not by nature gregarious, and they certainly don\u0027t have leaders.
