{"id":95568,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"\u0027It\u0027s the badge of King Verence,\u0027 said Magrat.\\n\\n \u0027Who\u0027s he?\u0027 said Granny Weatherwax.\\n\\n \u0027He rules this country,\u0027 said Magrat.\\n\\n \u0027Oh. That king,\u0027 said Granny, as if the matter was hardly worth noting.\\n\\n \u0027Soldiers fighting one another. Doesn\u0027t make sense,\u0027 said Nanny Ogg. \u0027Magrat, you have a look in the coach.\u0027\\n\\n The youngest witch poked around inside the bodywork and came back with a sack. She upended it, and something thudded on to the turf.\\n\\n The storm had rumbled off to the other side of the mountain now, and the watery moon shed a thin gruel of light over the damp moorland. It also gleamed off what was, without any doubt, an extremely important crown.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s a crown,\u0027 said Magrat. \u0027It\u0027s got all spiky bits on it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, dear,\u0027 said Granny.\\n\\n The child gurgled in its sleep. Granny Weatherwax didn\u0027t hold with looking at the future, but now she could feel the future looking at her.\\n\\n She didn\u0027t like its expression at all.\\n\\n King Verence was looking at the past, and had formed pretty much the same view.\\n\\n \u0027You can see me?\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, yes. Quite clearly, in fact,\u0027 said the newcomer.\\n\\n Verence\u0027s brows knotted. Being a ghost seemed to require considerably more mental effort than being alive; he\u0027d managed quite well for forty years without having to think more than once or twice a day, and now he was doing it all me time.\\n\\n \u0027Ah,\u0027 he said. \u0027You\u0027re a ghost, too.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well spotted.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It was the head under your arm,\u0027 said Verence, pleased with himself. \u0027That gave me a clue.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Does it bother you? I can put it back on if it bothers you,\u0027 said the old ghost helpfully. He extended his free hand. \u0027Pleased to meet you. I\u0027m Champot, King of Lancre.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Verence. Likewise.\u0027 He peered down at the old king\u0027s features and added, \u0027Don\u0027t seem to recall seeing your picture in the Long Gallery . . .\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, all that was after my time,\u0027 said Champot dismissively.\\n\\n \u0027How long have you been here, then?\u0027\\n\\n Champot reached down and rubbed his nose. \u0027About a thousand years,\u0027 he said, his voice tinged with pride. \u0027Man and ghost.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A thousand years!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I built this place, in fact. Just got it nicely decorated when my nephew cut my head off while I was asleep. I can\u0027t tell you how much that upset me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But . . . a thousand years . . .\u0027 Verence repeated, weakly.\\n\\n Champot took his arm. \u0027It\u0027s not that bad,\u0027 he confided, as he led the unresisting king across the courtyard. \u0027Better than being alive, in many ways.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They must be bloody strange ways, then!\u0027 snapped Verence. \u0027I liked being alive!\u0027\\n\\n Champot grinned reassuringly. \u0027You\u0027ll soon get used to it,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t want to get used to it!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ve got a strong morphogenic field,\u0027 said Champot. \u0027I can tell. I look for these things. Yes. Very strong, I should say.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s that?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I was never very good with words, you know,\u0027 said Champot. \u0027I always found it easier to hit people with something. But I gather it all boils down to how alive you were. When you were alive, I mean. Something called—\u0027 he paused – \u0027animal vitality. Yes, that was it. Animal vitality. The more you had, the more you stay yourself, as it were, if you\u0027re a ghost. I expect you were one hundred per cent alive, when you were alive,\u0027 he added.\\n\\n Despite himself, Verence felt flattered. \u0027I tried to keep myself busy,\u0027 he said. They had strolled through the wall into the Great Hall, which was now empty. The sight of the trestle tables triggered an automatic reaction in the king.\\n\\n \u0027How do we go about getting breakfast?\u0027 he said.\\n\\n Champot\u0027s head looked surprised.\\n\\n \u0027We don\u0027t,\u0027 he said. \u0027We\u0027re ghosts.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But I\u0027m hungry!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re not, you know. It\u0027s just your imagination.\u0027\\n\\n There was a clattering from the kitchens. The cooks were already up and, in the absence of any other instructions, were preparing the castle\u0027s normal breakfast menu. Familiar smells were wafting up from the dark archway that led to the kitchens.\\n\\n Verence sniffed.\\n\\n \u0027Sausages,\u0027 he said dreamily. \u0027Bacon. Eggs. Smoked fish.\u0027 He stared at Champot. \u0027Black pudding,\u0027 he whispered.\\n\\n \u0027You haven\u0027t actually got a stomach,\u0027 the old ghost pointed out. \u0027It\u0027s all in the mind. Just force of habit. You just think you\u0027re hungry.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I think I\u0027m ravenous.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, but you can\u0027t actually touch anything, you see,\u0027 Champot explained gently. \u0027Nothing at all.\u0027\\n\\n Verence lowered himself gently on to a bench, so that he did not drift through it, and sank his head in his hands. He\u0027d heard that death could be bad. He just hadn\u0027t realised how bad.\\n\\n He wanted revenge. He wanted to get out of this suddenly horrible castle, to find his son. But he was even more terrified to find that what he really wanted, right now, was a plate of kidneys.\\n\\n A damp dawn flooded across the landscape, scaled the battlements of Lancre Castle, stormed the keep and finally made it through the casement of the solar.\\n\\n Duke Felmet stared out gloomily at the dripping forest. There was such a lot of it. It wasn\u0027t, he decided, that he had anything against trees as such, it was just that the sight of so much of them was terribly depressing. He kept wanting to count them.\\n\\n \u0027Indeed, my love,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n The duke put those who met him in mind of some sort of lizard, possibly the type that lives on volcanic islands, moves once a day, has a vestigial third eye and blinks on a monthly basis. He considered himself to be a civilised man more suited to the dry air and bright sun of a properly-organised climate.\\n\\n On the other hand, he mused, it might be nice to be a tree. Trees didn\u0027t have ears, he was pretty sure of this. And they seemed to manage without the blessed state of matrimony. A male oak tree – he\u0027d have to look this up – a male oak tree just shed its pollen on the breeze and all the business with the acorns, unless it was oak apples, no, he was pretty sure it was acorns, took place somewhere else . . .\\n\\n \u0027Yes, my precious,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n Yes, trees had got it all worked out. Duke Felmet glared at the forest roof. Selfish bastards.\\n\\n \u0027Certainly, my dear,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027 said the duchess.\\n\\n The duke hesitated, desperately trying to replay the monologue of the last five minutes. There had been something about him being half a man, and . . . infirm on purpose? And he was sure there had been a complaint about the coldness of the castle. Yes, that was probably it. Well, those wretched trees could do a decent day\u0027s work for once.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll have some cut down and brought in directly, my cherished,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n Lady Felmet was momentarily speechless. This was by way of being a calendar event. She was a large and impressive woman, who gave people confronting her for the first time the impression that they were seeing a galleon under full sail; the effect was heightened by her unfortunate belief that red velvet rather suited her. However, it didn\u0027t set off her complexion. It matched it.\\n\\n The duke often mused on his good luck in marrying her. If it wasn\u0027t for the engine of her ambition he\u0027d be just another local lord, with nothing much to do but hunt, drink and exercise his droit de seigneur.[2] Instead, he was now just a step away from the throne, and might soon be monarch of all he surveyed.\\n\\n Provided that all he surveyed was trees. He sighed.\\n\\n \u0027Cut what down?\u0027 said Lady Felmet, icily.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, the trees,\u0027 said the duke.\\n\\n \u0027What have trees got to do with it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well. . . there are such a lot of them,\u0027 said the duke, with feeling.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t change the subject!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sorry, my sweet.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What I said was, how could you have been so stupid as to let them get away? I told you that servant was far too loyal. You can\u0027t trust someone like that.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, my love.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You didn\u0027t by any chance consider sending someone after them, I suppose?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Bentzen, my dear. And a couple of guards.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh.\u0027 The duchess paused. Bentzen, as captain of the duke\u0027s personal bodyguard, was as efficient a killer as a psychotic mongoose. He would have been her choice. It annoyed her to be temporarily deprived of a chance to fault her husband, but she rallied quite well.\\n\\n \u0027He wouldn\u0027t have needed to go out at all, if only you\u0027d listened to me. But you never do.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Do what, my passion?\u0027\\n\\n The duke yawned. It had been a long night. There had been a thunderstorm of quite unnecessarily dramatic proportions, and then there had been all that messy business with the knives.\\n\\n It has already been mentioned that Duke Felmet was one step away from the throne. The step in question was at the top of the flight leading to the Great Hall, down which King Verence had tumbled in the dark only to land, against all the laws of probability, on his own dagger.\\n\\n It had, however, been declared by his own physician to be a case of natural causes. Bentzen had gone to see the man and explained that falling down a flight of steps with a dagger in your back was a disease caused by unwise opening of the mouth.\\n\\n In fact it had already been caught by several members of the king\u0027s own bodyguard who had been a little bit hard of hearing. There had been a minor epidemic.\\n\\n The duke shuddered. There were details about last night that were both hazy and horrible.\\n\\n He tried to reassure himself that all the unpleasantness was over now, and he had a kingdom. It wasn\u0027t much of one, apparently being mainly trees, but it was a kingdom and it had a crown.\\n\\n If only they could find it.\\n\\n Lancre Castle was built on an outcrop of rock by an architect who had heard about Gormenghast but hadn\u0027t got the budget. He\u0027d done his best, though, with a tiny confection of cut-price turrets, bargain basements, buttresses, crenellations, gargoyles, towers, courtyards, keeps and dungeons; in fact, just about everything a castle needs except maybe reasonable foundations and the kind of mortar that doesn\u0027t wash away in a light shower.\\n\\n The castle leaned vertiginously over the racing white water of the Lancre river, which boomed darkly a thousand feet below. Every now and again a few bits fell in.\\n\\n Small as it was, though, the castle contained a thousand places to hide a crown.\\n\\n The duchess swept out to find someone else to berate, and left Lord Felmet looking gloomily at the landscape. It started to rain.\\n\\n It was on this cue that there came a thunderous knocking at the castle door. It seriously disturbed the castle porter, who was playing Cripple Mister Onion with the castle cook and the castle\u0027s Fool in the warmth of the kitchen.\\n\\n He growled and stood up. \u0027There is a knocking without,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027Without what?\u0027 said the Fool.\\n\\n \u0027Without the door, idiot.\u0027\\n\\n The Fool gave him a worried look. \u0027A knocking without a door?\u0027 he said suspiciously. \u0027This isn\u0027t some kind of Zen, is it?\u0027\\n\\n When the porter had grumbled off in the direction of the gatehouse the cook pushed another farthing into the kitty and looked sharply over his cards at the Fool.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s a Zen?\u0027 he said.\\n\\n The Fool\u0027s bells tinkled as he sorted through his cards. Without thinking, he said: \u0027Oh, a sub-sect of the Turnwise Klatch philosophical system of Sumtin, noted for its simple austerity and the offer of personal tranquillity and wholeness achieved through meditation and breathing techniques; an interesting aspect is the asking of apparently nonsensical questions in order to widen the doors of perception.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How\u0027s that again?\u0027 said the cook suspiciously. He was on edge. When he\u0027d taken the breakfast up to the Great Hall he\u0027d kept getting the feeling that something was trying to take the tray out of his hands. And as if that wasn\u0027t bad enough, this new duke had sent him back for . . . He shuddered. Oatmeal! And a runny boiled egg! The cook was too old for this sort of thing. He was set in his ways. He was a cook in the real feudal tradition. If it didn\u0027t have an apple in its mouth and you couldn\u0027t roast it, he didn\u0027t want to serve it. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wyrd-sisters-discworld-6/page-3.html","bookId":1625,"book":{"id":1625,"title":"Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6)","description":"Storyline: Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6) \\n Witches are not by nature gregarious, and they certainly don\u0027t have leaders.
