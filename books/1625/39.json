{"id":95603,"no":39,"title":"Page 39","content":"Inside, Granny Weatherwax finished speaking. \u0027You forgot about the crown,\u0027 whispered Nanny Ogg. \u0027Ah,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027Yes, the crown. It\u0027s on his head, d\u0027you see? We hid it among the crowns when the actors left, the reason being, no-one would look for it there. See how it fits him so perfectly.\u0027 It was a tribute to Granny\u0027s extraordinary powers of persuasion that everyone did see how perfectly it fitted Tomjon. In fact the only one who didn\u0027t was Tomjon himself, who was aware that it was only his ears that were stopping it becoming a necklace. \u0027Imagine the sensation when he put it on for the first time,\u0027 she went on. \u0027I expect there was an eldritch tingling sensation.\u0027 \u0027Actually, it felt rather—\u0027 Tomjon began, but no-one was listening to him. He shrugged and leaned over to Hwel, who was still scribbling busily. \u0027Does eldritch mean uncomfortable?\u0027 he hissed. The dwarf looked at him with unfocused eyes. \u0027What?\u0027 \u0027I said, does eldritch mean uncomfortable?\u0027 \u0027Eh? Oh. No. No, I shouldn\u0027t think so.\u0027 \u0027What does it mean then?\u0027 \u0027Dunno. Oblong, I think.\u0027 Hwel\u0027s glance returned to his scrawls as though magnetised. \u0027Can you remember what he said after all those tomorrows? I didn\u0027t catch the bit after that . . .\u0027 \u0027And there wasn\u0027t any need for you to tell everyone I was – adopted,\u0027 said Tomjon. \u0027That\u0027s how it was, you see,\u0027 said the dwarf vaguely. \u0027Best to be honest about these things. Now then, did he actually stab her, or just accuse her?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t want to be a king!\u0027 Tomjon whispered hoarsely. \u0027Everyone says I take after dad!\u0027 \u0027Funny thing, all this taking after people,\u0027 said the dwarf vaguely. \u0027I mean, if I took after my dad, I\u0027d be a hundred feet underground digging rocks, whereas—\u0027 His voice died away. He stared at the nib of his pen as though it held an incredible fascination. \u0027Whereas what?\u0027 \u0027Eh?\u0027 \u0027Aren\u0027t you even listening?\u0027 \u0027I knew it was wrong when I wrote it, I knew it was the wrong way round . . . What? Oh, yes. Be a king. It\u0027s a good job. It seems there\u0027s a lot of competition, at any rate. I\u0027m very happy for you. Once you\u0027re a king, you can do anything you want.\u0027 Tomjon looked at the faces of the Lancre worthies around the table. They had a keen, calculating look, like the audience at a fatstock show. They were weighing him up. It crept upon him in a cold and clammy way that once he was king, he could do anything he wanted. Provided that what he wanted to do was be king. \u0027You could build your own theatre,\u0027 said Hwel, his eyes lighting up for a moment. \u0027With as many trapdoors as you wanted, and magnificent costumes. You could act in a new play every night. I mean, it would make the Dysk look like a shed.\u0027 \u0027Who would come to see me?\u0027 said Tomjon, sagging in his seat. \u0027Everyone.\u0027 \u0027What, every night?\u0027 \u0027You could order them to,\u0027 said Hwel, without looking up. I knew he was going to say that, Tomjon thought. He can\u0027t really mean it, he added charitably. He\u0027s got his play. He doesn\u0027t really exist in this world, not right now at the moment. He took off the crown and turned it over and over in his hands. There wasn\u0027t much metal in it, but it felt heavy. He wondered how heavy it would get if you wore it all the time. At the head of the table was an empty chair containing, he had been assured, the ghost of his real father. It would have been nice to report that he had experienced anything more, when being introduced to it, than an icy sensation and a buzzing in the ears. \u0027I suppose I could help father pay off on the Dysk,\u0027 he said. \u0027That would be nice, yes,\u0027 said Hwel. He spun the crown in his fingers and listened glumly to the talk flowing back and forth over his head. \u0027Fifteen years?\u0027 said the Mayor of Lancre. \u0027We had to,\u0027 said Granny Weatherwax. \u0027I thought the baker was a bit early last week.\u0027 \u0027No, no,\u0027 said the witch impatiently. \u0027It doesn\u0027t work like that. No-one\u0027s lost anything.\u0027 \u0027According to my figuring,\u0027 said the man who doubled as Lancre\u0027s beadle, town clerk and gravedigger, \u0027we\u0027ve all lost fifteen years.\u0027 \u0027No, we\u0027ve all gained them,\u0027 said the mayor. \u0027It stands to reason. Time\u0027s like this sort of wiggly road, see, but we took a short cut across the fields.\u0027 \u0027Not at all,\u0027 said the clerk, sliding a sheet of paper across the table. \u0027Look here . . .\u0027 Tomjon let the waters of debate close over him again. Everyone wanted him to be king. No-one thought twice about what he wanted. His views didn\u0027t count. Yes, that was it. No-one wanted him to be king, not precisely him. He just happened to be convenient. Gold does not tarnish, at least physically, but Tomjon felt that the thin band of metal in his hands had an unpleasant depth to its lustre. It had sat on too many troubled heads. If you held it to your ear, you could hear the screams. He became aware of someone else looking at him, their gaze playing across his face like a blowlamp on a lolly. He looked up. It was the third witch, the young . . . the youngest one, with the intense expression and the hedgerow hairstyle. Sitting next to old Fool as though she owned a controlling interest. It wasn\u0027t his face she was examining. It was his features. Her eyeballs were tracking him from nape to nose like a pair of calipers. He gave her a little brave smile, which she ignored. Just like everyone else, he thought. Only the Fool noticed him, and returned the smile with an apologetic grin and a tiny conspiratorial wave of the fingers that said: \u0027What are we doing here, two sensible people like us?\u0027 The woman was looking at him again, turning her head this way and that and narrowing her eyes. She kept glancing at Fool and back to Tomjon. Then she turned to the oldest witch, the only person in the entire hot, damp room who seemed to have acquired a mug of beer, and whispered in her ear. The two started a spirited, whispered conversation. It was, thought Tomjon, a particularly feminine way of talking. It normally took place on doorsteps, with all the participants standing with their arms folded and, if anyone was so ungracious as to walk past, they\u0027d stop abruptly and watch them in silence until they were safely out of earshot. He became aware that Granny Weatherwax had stopped talking, and that the entire hall was staring at him expectantly. \u0027Hallo?\u0027 he said. \u0027It might be a good idea to hold the coronation tomorrow,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027It\u0027s not good for a kingdom to be without a ruler. It doesn\u0027t like it.\u0027 She stood up, pushed back her chair, and came and took Tomjon\u0027s hand. He followed her unprotestingly across the flagstones and up the steps to the throne, where she put her hands on his shoulders and pressed him gently down on to the threadbare red plush cushions. There was a scraping of benches and chairs. He looked around in panic. \u0027What\u0027s happening now?\u0027 he said. \u0027Don\u0027t worry,\u0027 said Granny firmly. \u0027Everyone wants to come and swear loyalty to you. You just nod graciously and ask everyone what they do and if they enjoy it. Oh, and you\u0027d better give them the crown back.\u0027 Tomjon removed it quickly. \u0027Why?\u0027 he said. \u0027They want to present it to you.\u0027 \u0027But I\u0027ve already got it!\u0027 said Tomjon desperately. Granny gave a patient sigh. \u0027Only in the wossname, real sense,\u0027 she said. \u0027This is more ceremonial.\u0027 \u0027You mean unreal?\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027But much more important.\u0027 Tomjon gripped the arms of the throne. \u0027Fetch me Hwel,\u0027 he said.\u0027 \u0027No, you must do it like that. It\u0027s precedent, you see, first you meet the—\u0027 \u0027I said, fetch me the dwarf. Didn\u0027t you hear me, woman?\u0027 This time Tomjon got the spin and pitch of his voice just right, but Granny rallied magnificently. \u0027I don\u0027t think you quite realise who you are talking to, young man,\u0027 she said. Tomjon half rose in his seat. He had played a great many kings, and most of them weren\u0027t the kind of kings who shook hands graciously and asked people whether they enjoyed their work. They were far more the type of kings who got people to charge into battle at five o\u0027clock on a freezing morning and still managed to persuade them that this was better than being in bed. He summoned them all, and treated Granny Weatherwax to a blast of royal hauteur, pride and arrogance. \u0027We thought we were talking to a subject,\u0027 he said. \u0027Now do as we say!\u0027 Granny\u0027s face was immobile for several seconds as she worked out what to do next. Then she smiled to herself, said lightly, \u0027As you wish,\u0027 and went and dislodged Hwel, who was still writing. The dwarf gave a stiff bow. \u0027None of that,\u0027 snapped Tomjon. \u0027What do I do next?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know. Do you want me to write an acceptance speech?\u0027 \u0027I told you. I don\u0027t want to be king!\u0027 \u0027Could be a problem with an acceptance speech, then,\u0027 the dwarf agreed. \u0027Have you really thought about this? Being king is a great role.\u0027 \u0027But it\u0027s the only one you get to play!\u0027 \u0027Hmm. Well, just tell them “no”, then.\u0027 \u0027Just like that? Will it work?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s got to be worth a try.\u0027 A group of Lancre dignitaries were approaching with the crown on a cushion. They wore expressions of constipated respect coupled with just a hint of self-satisfaction. They carried the crown as if it was a Present for a Good Boy. The Mayor of Lancre coughed behind his hand. \u0027A proper coronation will take some time to arrange,\u0027 he began, \u0027but we would like—\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 said Tomjon. The mayor hesitated. \u0027Pardon?\u0027 he said. \u0027I won\u0027t accept it.\u0027 The mayor hesitated again. His lips moved and his eyes glazed slightly. He felt that he had got lost somewhere, and decided it would be best to start again. \u0027A proper coronation will take—\u0027 he ventured. \u0027It won\u0027t,\u0027 said Tomjon. \u0027I will not be king.\u0027 The mayor was mouthing like a carp. \u0027Hwel?\u0027 said Tomjon desperately. \u0027You\u0027re good with words.\u0027 The problem we\u0027ve got here,\u0027 said the dwarf, \u0027is that “no” is apparently not among the options when you are offered a crown. I think he could cope with “maybe”.\u0027 Tomjon stood up, and grabbed the crown. He held it above his head like a tambourine. \u0027Listen to me, all of you,\u0027 he said. \u0027I thank you for your offer, it\u0027s a great honour. But I can\u0027t accept it. I\u0027ve worn more crowns than you can count, and the only kingdom I know how to rule has got curtains in front of it. I\u0027m sorry.\u0027 Dead silence greeted this. They did not appear to have been the right words. \u0027Another problem,\u0027 said Hwel conversationally, \u0027is that you don\u0027t actually have a choice. You are the king, you see. It\u0027s a job you are lined up for when you\u0027re born.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027d be no good at it!\u0027 \u0027That doesn\u0027t matter. A king isn\u0027t something you\u0027re good at, it\u0027s something you are.\u0027 \u0027You can\u0027t leave me here! There\u0027s nothing but forests!\u0027 Tomjon felt the suffocating cold sensation again, and the slow buzzing in his ears. For a moment he thought he saw, faint as a mist, a tall sad man in front of him, stretching out a hand in supplication. \u0027I\u0027m sorry,\u0027 he whispered. \u0027I really am.\u0027 Through the fading shape he saw the witches, watching him intently. Beside him Hwel said, \u0027The only chance you\u0027d have is if there was another heir. You don\u0027t remember any brothers and sisters, do you?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t remember anyone! Hwel, I—\u0027 There was another ferocious argument among the witches. And then Magrat was striding, striding across the hall, moving like a tidal wave, moving like a rush of blood to the head, shaking off Granny Weatherwax\u0027s restraining hand, bearing down on the throne like a piston, and dragging the Fool behind her. \u0027I say?\u0027 \u0027Er. Halloee!\u0027 \u0027Er, I say, excuse me, can anyone hear us?\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wyrd-sisters-discworld-6/page-39.html","bookId":1625,"book":{"id":1625,"title":"Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6)","description":"Storyline: Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6) Witches are not by nature gregarious, and they certainly don\u0027t have leaders.
