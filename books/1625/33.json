Or help her across the r-river.\u0027\n \u0027You have?\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s t-terribly b-bad luck not to.\u0027\n Tomjon gave Granny a polite smile.\n \u0027Would you care to share our lunch, good mo – old wo – ma\u0027am?\u0027\n Granny looked doubtful.\n \u0027What is it?\u0027\n \u0027Salt pork.\u0027\n She shook her head. \u0027Thanks all the same,\u0027 she said graciously. \u0027But it gives me wind.\u0027\n She turned on her heel and set off through the bushes.\n \u0027We could help you across the river if you like,\u0027 shouted Tomjon after her.\n \u0027What river?\u0027 said Hwel. \u0027We\u0027re on the moor, there can\u0027t be a river in miles.\u0027\n \u0027Y-you\u0027ve got to get them on y-your side,\u0027 said Wimsloe. \u0027Then t-they help you.\u0027\n \u0027Perhaps we should have asked her to wait while we went and looked for one,\u0027 said Hwel sourly.\n They found the turning. It led into a forest criss-crossed with as many tracks as a marshalling yard, the sort of forest where the back of your head tells you the trees are turning around to watch you as you go past and the sky seems to be very high up and a long way off. Despite the heat of the day a dank, impenetrable gloom hovered among the tree trunks, which crowded up to the track as if intending to obliterate it completely.\n They were soon lost again, and decided that being lost somewhere where you didn\u0027t know where you were was even worse than being lost in the open.\n \u0027She could have given more explicit instructions,\u0027 said Hwel.\n \u0027Like ask at the next crone,\u0027 said Tomjon. \u0027Look over there.\u0027\n He stood up in the seat.\n \u0027Ho there, old . . . good . . .\u0027 he hazarded.\n Magrat pushed back her shawl.\n \u0027Just a humble wood gatherer,\u0027 she snapped. She held up a twig for proof. Several hours waiting with nothing but trees to talk to hadn\u0027t improved her temper.\n Wimsloe nudged Tomjon, who nodded and fixed his face in an ingratiating smile.\n \u0027Would you care to share our lunch, old . . . good wo . . . miss?\u0027 he said. \u0027It\u0027s only salt pork, I\u0027m afraid.\u0027\n \u0027Meat is extremely bad for the digestive system,\u0027 said Magrat. \u0027If you could see inside your colon you\u0027d be horrified.\u0027\n \u0027I think I would,\u0027 muttered Hwel.\n \u0027Did you know that an adult male carries up to five pounds of undigested red meat in his intestines at all times?\u0027 said Magrat, whose informative lectures on nutrition had been known to cause whole families to hide in the cellar until she went away. \u0027Whereas pine kernels and sunflower seeds—\u0027\n \u0027There aren\u0027t any rivers around that you need helping over, are there?\u0027 said Tomjon desperately.\n \u0027Don\u0027t be silly,\u0027 said Magrat. \u0027I\u0027m just a humble wood gatherer, lawks, collecting a few sticks and mayhap directing lost travellers on the road to Lancre.\u0027\n \u0027Ah,\u0027 said Hwel, \u0027I thought we\u0027d get to that.\u0027\n \u0027You fork left up ahead and turn right at the big stone with the crack in it, you can\u0027t miss it,\u0027 said Magrat.\n \u0027Fine,\u0027 growled Hwel. \u0027Well, we won\u0027t keep you. I\u0027m sure you\u0027ve got a lot of wood to collect and so forth.\u0027\n He whistled the mules into a plod again, grumbling to himself.\n When, an hour later, the track ran out among a landscape of house-sized boulders, Hwel laid down the reins carefully and folded his arms. Tomjon stared at him.\n \u0027What do you think you\u0027re doing?\u0027 he said.\n \u0027Waiting,\u0027 said the dwarf grimly.\n \u0027It\u0027ll be getting dark soon.\u0027\n \u0027We won\u0027t be here long,\u0027 said Hwel.\n Eventually Nanny Ogg gave up and came out from behind her rock.\n \u0027It\u0027s salt pork, understand?\u0027 said Hwel sharply. \u0027Take it or leave it, okay? Now – which way\u0027s Lancre?\u0027\n \u0027Keep on, left at the ravine, then you pick up the track that leads to a bridge, you can\u0027t miss it,\u0027 said Nanny promptly.\n Hwel grabbed the reins. \u0027You forgot about the lawks.\u0027\n \u0027Bugger. Sorry. Lawks.\u0027\n \u0027And you\u0027re a humble old wood gatherer, I expect,\u0027 Hwel went on.\n \u0027Spot on, lad,\u0027 said Nanny cheerfully. \u0027Just about to make a start, as a matter of fact.\u0027\n Tomjon nudged the dwarf.\n \u0027You forgot about the river,\u0027 he said. Hwel glared at him.\n \u0027Oh yes,\u0027 he muttered, \u0027and can you wait here while we go and find a river.\u0027\n \u0027To help you across,\u0027 said Tomjon carefully.\n Nanny Ogg gave him a bright smile. \u0027There\u0027s a perfectly good bridge,\u0027 she said. \u0027But I wouldn\u0027t say no to a lift. Move over.\u0027\n To Hwel\u0027s irritation Nanny Ogg hitched up her skirts and scrambled on to the board, inserting herself between Tomjon and the dwarf and then twisting like an oyster knife until she occupied half the seat.\n \u0027You mentioned salt pork,\u0027 she said. \u0027There wouldn\u0027t be any mustard, would there?\u0027\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Hwel sullenly.\n \u0027Can\u0027t abide salt pork without condiments,\u0027 said Nanny conversationally. \u0027But pass it over, anyway.\u0027 Wimsloe wordlessly handed over the basket holding the troupe\u0027s supper. Nanny lifted the lid and gave it a critical assessment.\n \u0027That cheese in there is a bit off,\u0027 she said. \u0027It needs eating up quick. What\u0027s in the leather bottle?\u0027\n \u0027Beer,\u0027 said Tomjon, a fraction of a second before Hwel had the presence of mind to say, \u0027Water.\u0027\n \u0027Pretty weak stuff,\u0027 said Nanny, eventually. She fumbled in her apron pocket for her tobacco pouch.\n \u0027Has anyone got a light?\u0027 she inquired.\n A couple of actors produced bundles of matches. Nanny nodded, and put the pouch away.\n \u0027Good,\u0027 she said. \u0027Now, has anyone got any tobacco?\u0027\n Half an hour later the lattys rattled over the Lancre Bridge, across some of the outlying farmlands, and through the forests that made up most of the kingdom.\n \u0027This is it?\u0027 said Tomjon.\n \u0027Well, not all of it,\u0027 said Nanny, who had been expecting rather more enthusiasm. \u0027There\u0027s lots more of it behind the mountains over there. But this is the flat bit.\u0027\n \u0027You call this flat?\u0027\n \u0027Flattish,\u0027 Nanny conceded. \u0027But the air\u0027s good. That\u0027s the palace up there, offering outstanding views of the surrounding countryside.\u0027\n \u0027You mean forests.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027ll like it here,\u0027 said Nanny encouragingly.\n \u0027It\u0027s a bit small.\u0027\n Nanny thought about this. She\u0027d spent nearly all her life inside the boundaries of Lancre. It had always seemed about the right size to her.\n \u0027Bijou,\u0027 she said. \u0027Handy for everywhere.\u0027\n \u0027Everywhere where?\u0027\n Nanny gave up. \u0027Everywhere close,\u0027 she said.\n Hwel said nothing. The air was good, rolling down the unclimbable slopes of the Ramtops like a sinus wash, tinted with turpentine from the high forests. They passed through a gateway into what was, up here, probably called a town; the cosmopolitan he had become decided that, down on the plains, it would just about have qualified, as an open space.\n \u0027There\u0027s an inn,\u0027 said Tomjon doubtfully.\n Hwel followed his gaze. \u0027Yes,\u0027 he said, eventually. \u0027Yes, it probably is.\u0027\n \u0027When are we going to do the play?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t know. I think we just send up to the castle and say we\u0027re here.\u0027 Hwel scratched his chin. \u0027Fool said the king or whoever would want to see the script.\u0027\n Tomjon looked around Lancre town. It seemed peaceful enough. It didn\u0027t look like the kind of place likely to turn actors out at nightfall. It needed the population.\n \u0027This is the capital city of the kingdom,\u0027 said Nanny Ogg. \u0027Well-designed streets, you\u0027ll notice.\u0027\n \u0027Streets?\u0027 said Tomjon.\n \u0027Street,\u0027 corrected Granny. \u0027Also houses in quite good repair, stone\u0027s throw from river—\u0027\n \u0027Throw?\u0027\n \u0027Drop,\u0027 Nanny conceded. \u0027Neat middens, look, and extensive—\u0027\n \u0027Madam, we\u0027ve come to entertain the town, not buy it,\u0027 said Hwel.\n Nanny Ogg looked sidelong at Tomjon.\n \u0027Just wanted you to see how attractive it is,\u0027 she said.\n \u0027Your civic pride does you credit,\u0027 said Hwel. \u0027And now, please, leave the cart. I\u0027m sure you\u0027ve got some wood to gather. Lawks.\u0027\n \u0027Much obliged for the snack,\u0027 said Nanny, climbing down.\n \u0027Meals,\u0027 corrected Hwel.\n Tomjon nudged him. \u0027You ought to be more polite,\u0027 he said. \u0027You never know.\u0027 He turned to Nanny. \u0027Thank you, good – oh, she\u0027s gone.\u0027\n \u0027They\u0027ve come to do a theatre,\u0027 said Nanny.\n Granny Weatherwax carried on shelling beans in the sun, much to Nanny\u0027s annoyance.\n \u0027Well? Aren\u0027t you going to say something? I\u0027ve been finding out things,\u0027 she said. \u0027Picking up information. Not sitting around making soup—\u0027\n \u0027Stew.\u0027\n \u0027I reckon it\u0027s very important,\u0027 sniffed Nanny.\n \u0027What kind of a theatre?\u0027\n \u0027They didn\u0027t say. Something for the duke, I think.\u0027\n \u0027What\u0027s he want a theatre for?\u0027\n \u0027They didn\u0027t say that, either.\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s probably all a trick to get in the castle,\u0027 Granny said knowingly. \u0027Very clever idea. Did you see anything in the carts?\u0027\n \u0027Boxes and bundles and such.\u0027\n \u0027They\u0027ll be full of armour and weapons, depend upon it.\u0027\n Nanny Ogg looked doubtful.\n They didn\u0027t look very much like soldiers to me. They were awfully young and spotty.\u0027\n \u0027Clever. I expect in the middle of the play the king will manifest his destiny, right where everyone can see him. Good plan.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s another thing,\u0027 said Nanny, picking up a bean pod and chewing it. \u0027He doesn\u0027t seem to like the place much.\u0027\n \u0027Of course he does. It\u0027s in his blood.\u0027\n \u0027I brought him the pretty way. He didn\u0027t seem very impressed.\u0027\n Granny hesitated.\n \u0027He was probably suspicious of you,\u0027 she concluded. \u0027He was probably too overcome to speak, really.\u0027\n She put down the bowl of beans and looked thoughtfully at the trees.\n \u0027Have you got any family still working up at the castle?\u0027 she said.\n \u0027Shirl and Daff help out in the kitchens since the cook went off his head.\u0027\n \u0027Good. I\u0027ll have a word with Magrat. I think we should see this theatre.\u0027\n \u0027Perfect,\u0027 said the duke.\n \u0027Thank you,\u0027 said Hwel.\n \u0027You\u0027ve got it exactly spot on about that dreadful accident,\u0027 said the duke. \u0027You might almost have been there. Ha. Ha.\u0027\n \u0027You weren\u0027t, were you?\u0027 said Lady Felmet, leaning forward and glaring at the dwarf.\n \u0027I just used my imagination,\u0027 said Hwel hurriedly. The duchess glared at him, suggesting that his imagination could consider itself lucky it wasn\u0027t being dragged off to the courtyard to explain itself to four angry wild horses and a length of chain.\n \u0027Exactly right,\u0027 said the duke, leafing one-handedly through the pages. \u0027This is exactly, exactly, exactly how it was.\u0027\n \u0027Will have been,\u0027 snapped the duchess.\n The duke turned another page.\n \u0027You\u0027re in this too,\u0027 he said. \u0027Amazing. It\u0027s a word for word how I\u0027m going to remember it. I see you\u0027ve got Death in it, too.\u0027\n \u0027Always popular,\u0027 said Hwel. \u0027People expect it.\u0027\n \u0027How soon can you act it?\u0027\n \u0027Stage it,\u0027 corrected Hwel, and added, \u0027We\u0027ve tried it out. As soon as you like.\u0027 And then we can get away from here, he said to himself, away from your eyes like two raw eggs and this female mountain in the red dress and this castle which seems to act like a magnet for the wind. This is not going to go down as one of my best plays, I know that much.\n \u0027How much did we say we were going to pay you?\u0027 said the duchess.\n \u0027I think you mentioned another hundred silver pieces,\u0027 said Hwel.\n \u0027Worth every penny,\u0027 said the duke.\n Hwel left hurriedly, before the duchess could start to bargain. But he felt he\u0027d gladly pay something to be out of this place. Bijou, he thought. Gods, how could anyone like a kingdom like this?\n The Fool waited in the meadow with the lake. He stared wistfully at the sky and wondered where the hell Magrat was. This was, she said, their place; the fact that a few dozen cows also shared it at the moment didn\u0027t appear to make any difference. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wyrd-sisters-discworld-6/page-33.html","bookId":1625,"book":{"id":1625,"title":"Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6)","description":"Storyline: \n Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6) \n Witches are not by nature gregarious, and they certainly don\u0027t have leaders.
