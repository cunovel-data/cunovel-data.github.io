I could of caught my death in that dungeon for all he cared.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We ain\u0027t going to curse him,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027We\u0027re going to replace him. What did you do with the old king?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I left the rock on the kitchen table,\u0027 said Nanny. \u0027I couldn\u0027t stand it any more.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t see why,\u0027 said Magrat. \u0027He seemed very pleasant. For a ghost.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, he was all right. It was the others,\u0027 said Nanny.\\n\\n \u0027Others?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027 “Pray carry a stone out of the palace so\u0027s I can haunt it, good mother,” he says,\u0027 said Nanny Ogg. \u0027 “It\u0027s bloody boring in here, Mistress Ogg, excuse my Klatchian,” he says, so of course I did. I reckon they was all listening. Ho yes, they all thinks, all aboard, time for a bit of a holiday. I\u0027ve nothing against ghosts. Especially royal ghosts,\u0027 she added loyally. \u0027But my cottage isn\u0027t the place for them. I mean, there\u0027s some woman in a chariot yelling her head off in the washhouse. I ask you. And there\u0027s a couple of little kiddies in the pantry, and men without heads all over the place, and someone screaming under the sink, and there\u0027s this little hairy man wandering around looking lost and everything. It\u0027s not right.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Just so long as he\u0027s not here,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027We don\u0027t want any men around.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027s a ghost, not a man,\u0027 said Magrat.\\n\\n \u0027We don\u0027t have to go into details,\u0027 Granny said icily.\\n\\n \u0027But you can\u0027t put the old king back on the throne,\u0027 said Magrat. \u0027Ghosts can\u0027t rule. You\u0027d never get the crown to stay on. It\u0027d drop through.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027re going to replace him with his son,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027Proper succession.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, we\u0027ve been through all that,\u0027 said Nanny, dismissively. \u0027In about fifteen years\u0027 time, perhaps, but—\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Tonight,\u0027 said Granny.\\n\\n \u0027A child on the throne? He wouldn\u0027t last five minutes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not a child,\u0027 said Granny quietly. \u0027A grown man. Remember Aliss Demurrage?\u0027\\n\\n There was silence. Then Nanny Ogg sat back.\\n\\n \u0027Bloody hell,\u0027 she whispered. \u0027You ain\u0027t going to try that, are you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I mean to have a go.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Bloody hell,\u0027 said Nanny again, very quietly, and added. \u0027You\u0027ve been thinking about this, have you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027See here, Esme. I mean, Black Aliss was one of the best. I mean, you\u0027re very good at, well, headology and thinking and that. I mean, Black Aliss, well, she just upped and went at it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You saying I couldn\u0027t do it, are you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Excuse me,\u0027 said Magrat.\\n\\n \u0027No. No. Of course not,\u0027 said Nanny, ignoring her.\\n\\n \u0027Right.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Only . . . well, she was a, you know, a hoyden of witches, like the king said.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Doyenne,\u0027 said Granny, who had looked it up. \u0027Not hoyden.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Excuse me,\u0027 said Magrat, louder this time. \u0027Who was Black Aliss? And,\u0027 she added quickly, \u0027none of this exchanging meaningful glances and talking over my head. There\u0027s three witches in this coven, remember?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027She was before your time,\u0027 said Nanny Ogg. \u0027Before mine, really. She lived over Skunid way. Very powerful witch.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027If you listen to rumour,\u0027 said Granny.\\n\\n \u0027She turned a pumpkin into a royal coach once,\u0027 said Nanny.\\n\\n \u0027Showy,\u0027 said Granny Weatherwax. \u0027That\u0027s no help to anyone, turning up at a ball smelling like a pie. And that business with the glass slipper. Dangerous, to my mind.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But the biggest thing she ever did,\u0027 said Nanny, ignoring the interruption, \u0027was to send a whole palace to sleep for a hundred years until. . .\u0027 She hesitated. \u0027Can\u0027t remember. Was there rose bushes involved, or was it spinning wheels in that one? I think some princess had to finger . . . no, there was a prince. That was it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Finger a prince?\u0027 said Magrat, uneasily.\\n\\n \u0027No . . .he had to kiss her. Very romantic, Black Aliss was. There was always a bit of romance in her spells. She liked nothing better than Girl meets Frog.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why did they call her Black Aliss?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Fingernails,\u0027 said Granny.\\n\\n \u0027And teeth,\u0027 said Nanny Ogg. \u0027She had a sweet tooth. Lived in a real gingerbread cottage. Couple of kids shoved her in her own oven at the end. Shocking.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And you\u0027re going to send the castle to sleep?\u0027 said Magrat.\\n\\n \u0027She never sent the castle to sleep,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027That\u0027s just an old wives\u0027 tale,\u0027 she added, glaring at Nanny. \u0027She just stirred up time a little. It\u0027s not as hard as people think. Everyone does it all the time. It\u0027s like rubber, is time. You can stretch it to suit yourself.\u0027\\n\\n Magrat was about to say, that\u0027s not right, time is time, every second lasts a second, that\u0027s what it\u0027s for, that\u0027s its job . . .\\n\\n And then she recalled weeks that had flown past and afternoons that had lasted forever. Some minutes had lasted hours, some hours had gone past so quickly she hadn\u0027t been aware they\u0027d gone past at all . . .\\n\\n \u0027But that\u0027s just people\u0027s perception,\u0027 she said. \u0027Isn\u0027t it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, yes,\u0027 said Granny, \u0027of course it is. It all is. What difference does that make?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A hundred years\u0027d be over-egging it, mind,\u0027 said Nanny.\\n\\n \u0027I reckon fifteen\u0027d be a nice round number,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027That means the lad will be eighteen at the finish. We just do the spell, go and fetch him, he can manifest his destiny, and everything will be nice and neat.\u0027\\n\\n Magrat didn\u0027t comment on this, because it had occurred to her that destinies sounded easy enough when you talked about them but were never very bankable where real human beings were concerned. But Nanny Ogg sat back and tipped another generous measure of apple brandy in her tea.\\n\\n \u0027Could work out nice,\u0027 she said. \u0027A bit of peace and quiet for fifteen years. If I recall the spell, after you say it you have to fly around the castle before cock crow.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I wasn\u0027t thinking about that,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027It wouldn\u0027t be right. Felmet would still be king all that time. The kingdom would still get sick. No, what I was thinking of doing was moving the whole kingdom.\u0027\\n\\n She beamed at them.\\n\\n \u0027The whole of Lancre?\u0027 said Nanny.\\n\\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Fifteen years into the future?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\\n\\n Nanny looked at Granny\u0027s broomstick. It was a well-made thing, built to last, apart from the occasional starting problem. But there were limits.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ll never do it,\u0027 she said. \u0027Not around the whole kingdom in that. That\u0027s all the way up to Powderknife and down to Drumlin\u0027s Fell. You just couldn\u0027t carry enough magic.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve thought of that,\u0027 said Granny.\\n\\n She beamed again. It was terrifying.\\n\\n She explained the plan. It was dreadful.\\n\\n A minute later the moor was deserted, as the witches hurried to their tasks. It was silent for a while, apart from the squeak of bats and the occasional rustle of the wind in the heather.\\n\\n Then there was a bubbling from the nearby peat bog. Very slowly, crowned with a thicket of sphagnum moss, the standing stone surfaced and peered around the landscape with an air of deep distrust.\\n\\n Greebo was really enjoying this. At first he thought his new friend was taking him to Magrat\u0027s cottage, but for some reason he\u0027d wandered off the path in the dark and was taking a stroll in the forest. In one of the more interesting bits, Greebo had always felt. It was a hummocky area, rich in hidden potholes and small, intense swamps, full of mist even in fine weather. Greebo often came up here on the offchance that a wolf was lying up for the day.\\n\\n \u0027I thought cats could find their own way home,\u0027 the Fool muttered.\\n\\n He cursed himself under his breath. It would have been easy to take this wretched creature back to Nanny Ogg\u0027s house, which was only a few streets away, almost in the shadow of the castle. But then he\u0027d had the idea of delivering it to Magrat. It would impress her, he thought. Witches were very keen on cats. And then she\u0027d be bound to ask him in, for a cup of tea or something . . .\\n\\n He put his foot in another water-filled hole. Something wriggled underneath it. The Fool groaned, and stepped back on to a tumescent mushroom.\\n\\n \u0027Look, cat,\u0027 he said. \u0027You\u0027ve got to come down, right? And then you can find your way home and I\u0027ll follow you. Cats are good at seeing in the dark and finding their own way home,\u0027 he added hopefully.\\n\\n He reached up. Greebo sank his claws into his arm as a friendly warning, and found to his surprise that this had no effect on chain mail.\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s a good cat,\u0027 said the Fool, and lowered him to the ground. \u0027Go on, find your way home. Any home will do.\u0027\\n\\n Greebo\u0027s grin gradually faded, until there was nothing left but the cat. This was nearly as spooky as the opposite way round.\\n\\n He stretched and yawned to hide his embarrassment. Being called a good cat in the middle of one of his favourite stalking grounds wasn\u0027t going to do anything for his prowl-credibility. He disappeared into the undergrowth.\\n\\n The Fool peered into the gloom. It dawned on him that while he liked forests, he liked them at one remove, as it were; it was nice to know that they were there, but the forests of the mind were not quite the same as real forests that, for example, you got lost in. They had more mighty oaks and fewer brambles. They also tended to be viewed in daylight, and the trees didn\u0027t have malevolent faces and long scratchy branches. The trees of the imagination were proud giants of the forest. Most of the trees here appeared to be vegetable gnomes, mere trellises for fungi and ivy.\\n\\n The Fool was vaguely aware that you could tell which direction the Hub lay by seeing which side of the trees the moss grew on. A quick inspection of the nearby trunks indicated that, in defiance of all normal geography, the Hub lay everywhere.\\n\\n Greebo had vanished.\\n\\n The Fool sighed, removed his chain mail protection, and tinkled gently through the night in search of high ground. High ground seemed a good idea. The ground he was on at the moment appeared to be trembling. He was sure it shouldn\u0027t do that.\\n\\n Magrat hovered on her broomstick several hundred feet above the Turnwise borders of Lancre, looking down on a sea of mist through which the occasional treetop poked like a seaweed-covered rock at high tide. A bulging moon floated above her, probably gibbous again. Even a decent thin crescent would have been better, she felt. More appropriate.\\n\\n She shivered, and wondered where Granny Weatherwax was at this moment.\\n\\n The old witch\u0027s broomstick was known and feared throughout the skies of Lancre. Granny had been introduced to flying quite late in life, and after some initial suspicion had taken to it like a bluebottle to an ancient fish-head. A problem, however, was that Granny saw every flight simply as a straight line from A to B and was unable to get alongside the idea that other users of the air might have any rights whatsoever; the flight migration patterns of an entire continent had been changed because of that simple fact. High-speed evolution among local birds had developed a generation that flew on their backs, so that they could keep a watchful eye on the skies.\\n\\n Granny\u0027s implicit belief that everything should get out of her way extended to other witches, very tall trees and, on occasion, mountains.\\n\\n Granny had also browbeaten the dwarfs who lived under the mountains and in fear of their lives into speeding the thing up. Many an egg had been laid in mid-air by unsuspecting fowls who had suddenly glimpsed Granny bearing down on them, scowling over the top of the broomstick.\\n\\n \u0027Oh dear,\u0027 thought Magrat. \u0027I hope she hasn\u0027t happened to someone.\u0027\\n\\n A midnight breeze turned her gently around in the air, like an unsupported weathercock. She shivered and squinted at the moonlit mountains, the high Ramtops, whose freezing crags and ice-green chasms acknowledged no king or cartographer. Only on the Rim ward side was Lancre open to the world; the rest of its borders looked as jagged as a wolfs mouth and far more impassable. From up here it was possible to see the whole kingdom . . .\\n\\n There was a ripping noise in the sky above her, a blast of wind that spun her around again, and a Doppler-distorted cry of, \u0027Stop dreaming, girl!\u0027 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wyrd-sisters-discworld-6/page-23.html","bookId":1625,"book":{"id":1625,"title":"Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6)","description":"Storyline: Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6) \\n Witches are not by nature gregarious, and they certainly don\u0027t have leaders.
