{"id":95593,"no":28,"title":"Page 28","content":"Hwel put his arms over his head in panic. \u0027I didn\u0027t mean—\u0027 he began. In fact calling for silence was a sufficiently rare event in the middle of a tavern brawl that silence was what Tomjon got. And silence was what he filled. Hwel started as he heard the boy\u0027s voice ring out, full of confidence and absolutely first-class projection. \u0027Brothers! And yet may I call all men brother, for on this night—\u0027 The dwarf craned up to see Tomjon standing on a chair, one hand raised in the prescribed declamatory fashion. Around him men were frozen in the act of giving one another a right seeing-to, their faces turned to his. Down at tabletop height Hwel\u0027s lips moved in perfect synchronisation with the words as Tomjon went through the familiar speech. He risked another look. The fighters straightened up, pulled themselves together, adjusted the hang of their tunics, glanced apologetically at one another. Many of them were in fact standing to attention. Even Hwel felt a fizz in his blood, and he\u0027d written those words. He\u0027d slaved half a night over them, years ago, when Vitoller had declared that they needed another five minutes in Act III of The King of Ankh. \u0027Scribble us something with a bit of spirit in it,\u0027 he\u0027d said. \u0027A bit of zip and sizzle, y\u0027know. Something to summon up the blood and put a bit of backbone in our friends in the ha\u0027penny seats. And just long enough to give us time to change the set.\u0027 He\u0027d been a bit ashamed of that play at the time. The famous Battle of Morpork, he strongly suspected, had consisted of about two thousand men lost in a swamp on a cold, wet day, hacking one another into oblivion with rusty swords. What would the last King of Ankh have said to a pack of ragged men who knew they were outnumbered, outflanked and outgeneralled? Something with bite, something with edge, something like a drink of brandy to a dying man; no logic, no explanation, just words that would reach right down through a tired man\u0027s brain and pull him to his feet by his testicles. Now he was seeing its effect. He began to think the walls had fallen away, and there was a cold mist blowing over the marshes, its choking silence broken only by the impatient cries of the carrion birds . . . And this voice. And he\u0027d written the words, they were his, no half-crazed king had ever really spoken like this. And he\u0027d written all this to fill in a gap so that a castle made of painted sacking stretched over a frame could be shoved behind a curtain, and this voice was taking the coal dust of his words and filling the room with diamonds. I made these words, Hwel thought. But they don\u0027t belong to me. They belong to him. Look at those people. Not a patriotic thought among them, but if Tomjon asked them, this bunch of drunkards would storm die Patrician\u0027s palace tonight. And they\u0027d probably succeed. I just hope his mouth never falls into the wrong hands . . . As the last syllables died away, their white-hot echoes searing across every mind in the room, Hwel shook himself and crawled out of hiding and jabbed Tomjon on the knee. \u0027Come away now, you fool,\u0027 he hissed. \u0027Before it wears off.\u0027 He grasped the boy firmly by the arm, handed a couple of complimentary tickets to the stunned barman, and hurried up the steps. He didn\u0027t stop until they were a street away. \u0027I thought I was doing rather well there,\u0027 said Tomjon. \u0027A good deal too well, I reckon.\u0027 The boy rubbed his hands together. \u0027Right. Where shall we go next?\u0027 \u0027Next?\u0027 \u0027Tonight is young!\u0027 \u0027No, tonight is dead. It\u0027s today that\u0027s young,\u0027 said the dwarf hurriedly. \u0027Well, I\u0027m not going home yet. Isn\u0027t there somewhere a bit more friendly? We haven\u0027t actually drunk anything.\u0027 Hwel sighed. \u0027A troll tavern,\u0027 said Tomjon. \u0027I\u0027ve heard about them. There\u0027s some down in the Shades.[17] I\u0027d like to see a troll tavern.\u0027 They\u0027re for trolls only, boy. Molten lava to drink and rock music and cheese \u0027n\u0027 chutney flavoured pebbles.\u0027 \u0027What about dwarf bars?\u0027 \u0027You\u0027d hate it,\u0027 said Hwel, fervently. \u0027Besides, you\u0027d run out of headroom.\u0027 \u0027Low dives, are they?\u0027 \u0027Look at it like this – how long do you think you could sing about gold?\u0027 \u0027 “It\u0027s yellow and it goes chink and you can buy things with it,” \u0027 said Tomjon experimentally, as they strolled through the crowds on the Plaza of Broken Moons. \u0027Four seconds, I think.\u0027 \u0027Right. Five hours of it gets a bit repetitive.\u0027 Hwel kicked a pebble gloomily. He\u0027d investigated a few dwarf bars last time they were in town, and hadn\u0027t approved. For some reason his fellow expatriates, who at home did nothing more objectionable than mine a bit of iron ore and hunt small creatures, felt impelled, once in the big city, to wear chain mail underwear, go around with axes in their belts, and call themselves names like Timkin Rumbleguts. And no-one could beat a city dwarf when it came to quaffing. Sometimes they missed their mouths altogether. \u0027Anyway,\u0027 he added, \u0027you\u0027d get thrown out for being too creative. The actual words are, “Gold, gold, gold, gold, gold, gold”.\u0027 \u0027Is there a chorus?\u0027 \u0027 “Gold, gold, gold, gold, gold”,\u0027 said Hwel. \u0027You left out a “gold” there.\u0027 \u0027I think it\u0027s because I wasn\u0027t cut out to be a dwarf.\u0027 \u0027Cut down, lawn ornament,\u0027 said Tomjon. There was a little hiss of indrawn breath. \u0027Sorry,\u0027 said Tomjon hurriedly. \u0027It\u0027s just that father—\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ve known your father for a long time,\u0027 said Hwel \u0027Through thick and thin, and there was a damn sight more thin than thick. Since before you were bor—\u0027 He hesitated \u0027Times were hard in those days,\u0027 he mumbled. \u0027So what I\u0027m saying is . . . well, some things you earn.\u0027 \u0027Yes. I\u0027m sorry.\u0027 \u0027You see, just—\u0027 Hwel paused at the mouth of a dark alley \u0027Did you hear something?\u0027 he said. They squinted into the alley, once again revealing themselves as newcomers to the city. Morporkians don\u0027t look down dark alleys when they hear strange noises. If they see four struggling figures their first instinct is not to rush to anyone\u0027s assistance, or at least not to rush to the assistance of the one who appears to be losing and on the wrong end of someone else\u0027s boot. Nor do they shout \u0027Oi!\u0027 Above all, they don\u0027t look surprised when the assailants, instead of guiltily running off. flourish a small piece of cardboard in front of them. \u0027What\u0027s this?\u0027 said Tomjon. \u0027It\u0027s a clown!\u0027 said Hwel. \u0027They\u0027ve mugged a clown!\u0027 \u0027 “Theft Licence”?\u0027 said Tomjon, holding the card up to the light. \u0027That\u0027s right,\u0027 said the leader of the three. \u0027Only don\u0027t expect us to do you too, \u0027cos we\u0027re on our way home.\u0027 \u0027S\u0027right,\u0027 said one of his assistants. \u0027It\u0027s the thingy, the quota.\u0027 \u0027But you were kicking him!\u0027 \u0027Worl, not a lot. Not what you\u0027d call actual kicking.\u0027 \u0027More foot nudging, sort of thing,\u0027 said the third thief. \u0027Fair\u0027s fair. He bloody well went and fetched Ron here a right thump, didn\u0027t he?\u0027 \u0027Yeah. Some people have no idea.\u0027 \u0027Why, you heartless—\u0027 Hwel began, but Tomjon laid a cautioning hand on his head. The boy turned the card over. The obverse read: J. H. \u0027Flannelfoot\u0027 Boggis and Nephews Bespoke Thieves \u0027The Old Firm\u0027 (Estblshd AM 1789) All type Theft carryed out Professionly and with Disgression Houses cleared. 24-hr service. No job too small. LET US QUOTE YOU FOR OUR FAMILY RATE \u0027It seems to be in order,\u0027 he said reluctantly. Hwel paused in the act of helping the dazed victim to his feet. \u0027In order?\u0027 he shouted. \u0027To rob someone?\u0027 \u0027We\u0027ll give him a chitty, of course,\u0027 said Boggis. \u0027Lucky we found him first, really. Some of these newcomers in the business, they\u0027ve got no idea.\u0027[18] \u0027Cowboys,\u0027 agreed a nephew. \u0027How much did you steal?\u0027 said Tomjon. Boggis opened the clown\u0027s purse, which was stuck in his belt. Then he went pale. \u0027Oh, bleeding hell,\u0027 he said, The Nephews clustered around. \u0027We\u0027re for it, sort of thing.\u0027 \u0027Second time this year, uncle.\u0027 Boggis glared at the victim. \u0027Well, how was I to know? I wasn\u0027t to know, was I? I mean, look at him, how much would you expect him to have on him? Couple of coppers, right? I mean, we\u0027d never have done for him, only it was on our way home. You try and do someone a favour, this is what happens.\u0027 \u0027How much has he got, then?\u0027 said Tomjon. \u0027There must be a hundred silver dollars in here,\u0027 moaned Boggis, waving a purse. \u0027I mean, that\u0027s not my league. That\u0027s not my class. I can\u0027t handle that sort of money. You\u0027ve got to be in the Guild of Lawyers or something to steal that much. It\u0027s way over my quota, is that.\u0027 \u0027Give it back then,\u0027 said Tomjon. \u0027But I done him a receipt!\u0027 \u0027They\u0027ve all got, you know, numbers on,\u0027 explained the younger of the nephews. \u0027The Guild checks up, sort of . . .\u0027 Hwel grabbed Tomjon\u0027s hand. \u0027Will you excuse us a moment?\u0027 he said to the frantic thief, and dragged Tomjon to the other side of the alley. \u0027Okay,\u0027 he said. \u0027Who\u0027s gone mad? Them? Me? You?\u0027 Tomjon explained. \u0027It\u0027s legal?\u0027 \u0027Up to a certain point. Fascinating, isn\u0027t it? Man in a pub told me about it, sort of thing.\u0027 \u0027But he\u0027s stolen too much?\u0027 \u0027So it appears. I gather the Guild is very strict about it.\u0027 There was a groan from the victim hanging between them. He tinkled gently. \u0027Look after him,\u0027 said Tomjon. \u0027I\u0027ll sort this out.\u0027 He went back to the thieves, who were looking very worried. \u0027My client feels,\u0027 he said, \u0027that the situation could be resolved if you give the money back.\u0027 \u0027Ye-es,\u0027 said Boggis, approaching the idea as if it was a brand new theory of cosmic creation. \u0027But it\u0027s the receipt. see, we have to fill it up, time and place, signed and everything . . .\u0027 \u0027My client feels that possibly you could rob him of, let us say, five copper pieces,\u0027 said Tomjon, smoothly. \u0027—I bloody don\u0027t!—\u0027 shouted the Fool, who was coming round. That represents two copper pieces as the going rate, plus expenses of three copper pieces for time, call-out fees—\u0027 \u0027Wear and tear on cosh,\u0027 said Boggis. \u0027Exactly.\u0027 \u0027Very fair. Very fair.\u0027 Boggis looked over Tomjon\u0027s head at the Fool, who was now completely conscious and very angry. \u0027Very fair,\u0027 he said loudly. \u0027Statesmanlike. Much obliged, I\u0027m sure.\u0027 He looked down at Tomjon. \u0027And anything for yourself, sir?\u0027 he added. \u0027Just say the word. We\u0027ve got a special on GBH this season. Practically painless, you\u0027ll barely feel a thing.\u0027 \u0027Hardly breaks the skin,\u0027 said the older nephew. \u0027Plus you get choice of limb.\u0027 \u0027I believe I am well served in that area,\u0027 said Tomjon smoothly. \u0027Oh. Well. Right you are then. No problem.\u0027 \u0027Which merely leaves,\u0027 continued Tomjon, as the thieves started to walk away, \u0027the question of legal fees.\u0027 The gentle greyness at the stump of the night flowed across Ankh-Morpork. Tomjon and Hwel sat on either side of the table in their lodgings, counting. \u0027Three silver dollars and eighteen copper pieces in profit, I make it,\u0027 said Tomjon. \u0027That was amazing,\u0027 said the Fool. \u0027I mean, the way they volunteered to go home and get some more money as well, after you gave them that speech about the rights of man.\u0027 He dabbed some more ointment on his head. \u0027And the youngest one started to cry,\u0027 he added. \u0027Amazing.\u0027 \u0027It wears off,\u0027 said Hwel. \u0027You\u0027re a dwarf, aren\u0027t you?\u0027 Hwel didn\u0027t feel he could deny this. \u0027I can tell you\u0027re a Fool,\u0027 he said. \u0027Yes. It\u0027s the bells, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 said the Fool wearily, rubbing his ribs. \u0027Yes, and the bells.\u0027 Tomjon grimaced and kicked Hwel under die table. \u0027Well, I\u0027m very grateful,\u0027 said the Fool. He stood up, and winced. \u0027I\u0027d really like to show my gratitude,\u0027 he added. \u0027Is there a tavern open around here?\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wyrd-sisters-discworld-6/page-28.html","bookId":1625,"book":{"id":1625,"title":"Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6)","description":"Storyline: Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6) Witches are not by nature gregarious, and they certainly don\u0027t have leaders.
