{"id":95576,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"The Fool fumbled in his sleeve and produced a rather soiled red and yellow handkerchief embroidered with bells. The duke took it with an expression of pathetic gratitude and blew his nose. Then he held it away from him and gazed at it with demented suspicion. \u0027Is this a dagger I see before me?\u0027 he mumbled. \u0027Um. No, my lord. It\u0027s my handkerchief, you see. You can sort of tell the difference if you look closely. It doesn\u0027t have as many sharp edges.\u0027 \u0027Good fool,\u0027 said the duke, vaguely. Totally mad, the Fool thought. Several bricks short of a bundle. So far round the twist you could use him to open wine bottles. \u0027Kneel beside me, my Fool.\u0027 The Fool did so. The duke laid a soiled bandage on his shoulder. \u0027Are you loyal, Fool?\u0027 he said. \u0027Are you trustworthy?\u0027 \u0027I swore to follow my lord until death,\u0027 said the Fool hoarsely. The duke pressed his mad face close to the Fool, who looked up into a pair of bloodshot eyes. \u0027I didn\u0027t want to,\u0027 he hissed conspiratorially. \u0027They made me do it. I didn\u0027t want—\u0027 The door swung open. The duchess filled the doorway. In fact, she was nearly the same shape. \u0027Leonal!\u0027 she barked. The Fool was fascinated by what happened to the duke\u0027s eyes. The mad red flame vanished, was sucked backwards, and was replaced by the hard blue stare he had come to recognise. It didn\u0027t mean, he realised, that the duke was any less mad. Even the coldness of his sanity was madness in a way. The duke had a mind that ticked like a clock and, like a clock, it regularly went cuckoo. Lord Felmet looked up calmly. \u0027Yes, my dear?\u0027 \u0027What is the meaning of all this?\u0027 she demanded. \u0027Witches, I suspect,\u0027 said Lord Felmet. \u0027I really don\u0027t think—\u0027 the Fool began. Lady Felmet\u0027s glare didn\u0027t merely silence him, it almost nailed him to the wall. \u0027That is clearly apparent,\u0027 she said. \u0027You are an idiot.\u0027 \u0027A Fool, my lady.\u0027 \u0027As well,\u0027 she added, and turned back to her husband. \u0027So,\u0027 she said, smiling grimly. \u0027Still they defy you?\u0027 The duke shrugged. \u0027How should I fight magic?\u0027 he said. \u0027With words,\u0027 said the Fool, without thinking, and was instantly sorry. They were both staring at him. \u0027What?\u0027 said the duchess. The Fool dropped his mandolin in his embarrassment. \u0027In – in the Guild,\u0027 said the Fool, \u0027we learned that words can be more powerful even than magic.\u0027 \u0027Clown!\u0027 said the duke. \u0027Words are just words. Brief syllables. Sticks and stones may break my bones—\u0027 he paused, savouring the thought – \u0027but words can never hurt me.\u0027 \u0027My lord, there are such words that can,\u0027 said the Fool. \u0027Liar! Usurper! Murderer!\u0027 The duke jerked back and gripped the arms of the throne, wincing. \u0027Such words have no truth,\u0027 said the Fool, hurriedly. \u0027But they can spread like fire underground, breaking out to burn—\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s true! It\u0027s true!\u0027 screamed the duke. \u0027I hear them, all the time!\u0027 He leaned forward. \u0027It\u0027s the witches!\u0027 he hissed. \u0027Then, then, then they can be fought with other words,\u0027 said the Fool, \u0027Words can fight even witches,\u0027 \u0027What words?\u0027 said the duchess, thoughtfully. The Fool shrugged. \u0027Crone. Evil eye. Stupid old woman.\u0027 The duchess raised one thick eyebrow. \u0027You are not entirely an idiot, are you,\u0027 she said. \u0027You refer to rumour.\u0027 \u0027Just so, my lady.\u0027 The Fool rolled his eyes. What had he got himself into? \u0027It\u0027s the witches,\u0027 whispered the duke, to no-one in particular. \u0027We must tell the world about the witches. They\u0027re evil. They make it come back, the blood. Even sandpaper doesn\u0027t work.\u0027 There was another tremor as Granny Weatherwax hurried along the narrow, frozen pathways in the forest. A lump of snow slipped off a tree branch and poured over her hat. This wasn\u0027t right, she knew. Never mind about the -whatever it was – but it was unheard of for a witch to go out on Hogswatchnight. It was against all tradition. No-one knew why, but that wasn\u0027t the point. She came out on to the moorland and pounded across the brittle heather, which had been scoured of snow by the wind. There was a crescent moon near the horizon, and its pale glow lit up the mountains that towered over her. It was a different world up there, and one even a witch would rarely venture into; it was a landscape left over from the frosty birth of the world, all green ice and knife-edge ridges and deep, secret valleys. It was a landscape never intended for human beings – not hostile, any more than a brick or cloud is hostile, but terribly, terribly uncaring. Except that, this time, it was watching her. A mind quite unlike any other she had ever encountered was giving her a great deal of its attention. She glared up at the icy slopes, half expecting to see a mountainous shadow move against the stars. \u0027Who are you?\u0027 she shouted. \u0027What do you want?\u0027 Her voice bounced and echoed among the rocks. There was a distant boom of an avalanche, high among the peaks. On the crest of the moor, where in the summer partridges lurked among the bushes like small whirring idiots, was a standing stone. It stood roughly where the witches\u0027 territories met, although the boundaries were never formally marked out. The stone was about the same height as a tall man, and made of bluish tinted rock. It was considered intensely magical because, although there was only one of it, no-one had ever been able to count if, if it saw anyone looking at it speculatively, it shuffled behind them. It was the most self-effacing monolith ever discovered. It was also one of the numerous discharge points for the magic that accumulated in the Ramtops. The ground around it for several yards was bare of snow, and steamed gently. The stone began to edge away, and watched her suspiciously from behind a tree. She waited for ten minutes until Magrat came hurrying up the path from Mad Stoat, a village whose good-natured inhabitants were getting used to ear massage and flower-based homeopathic remedies for everything short of actual decapitation.[7] She was out of breath, and wore only a shawl over a nightdress that, if Magrat had anything to reveal, would have been very revealing. \u0027You felt it too?\u0027 she said. Granny nodded. \u0027Where\u0027s Gytha?\u0027 she said. They looked down the path that led to Lancre town, a huddle of lights in the snowy gloom. There was a party going on. Light poured out into the street. A line of people were winding in and out of Nanny Ogg\u0027s house, from inside which came occasional shrieks of laughter and the sounds of breaking glass and children grizzling. It was clear that family life was being experienced to its limits in that house. The two witches stood uncertainly in the street. \u0027Do you think we should go in?\u0027 said Magrat diffidently. \u0027It\u0027s not as though we were invited. And we haven\u0027t brought a bottle.\u0027 \u0027Sounds to me as if there\u0027s a deal too many bottles in there already,\u0027 said Granny Weatherwax disapprovingly. A man staggered out of the doorway, burped, bumped into Granny, said, \u0027Happy Hogswatchnight, missus,\u0027 glanced up at her face and sobered up instantly. \u0027Mss,\u0027 snapped Granny. \u0027I am most frightfully sorry—\u0027 he began. Granny swept imperiously past him. \u0027Come, Magrat,\u0027 she commanded. The din inside hovered around the pain threshold. Nanny Ogg got around the Hogswatchnight tradition by inviting the whole village in, and the air in the room was already beyond the reach of pollution controls. Granny navigated through the press of bodies by the sound of a cracked voice explaining to the world at large that, compared to an unbelievable variety of other animals, the hedgehog was quite fortunate. Nanny Ogg was sitting in a chair by the fire with a quart mug in one hand, and was conducting the reprise with a cigar. She grinned when she saw Granny\u0027s face. \u0027What ho, my old boiler,\u0027 she screeched above the din. \u0027See you turned up, then. Have a drink. Have two. Wotcher, Magrat. Pull up a chair and call the cat a bastard.\u0027 Greebo, who was curled up in the inglenook and watching the festivities with one slit yellow eye, flicked his tail once or twice. Granny sat down stiffly, a ramrod figure of decency. \u0027We\u0027re not staying,\u0027 she said, glaring at Magrat, who was tentatively reaching out towards a bowl of peanuts. \u0027I can see you\u0027re busy. We just wondered whether you might have noticed – anything. Tonight. A little while ago.\u0027 Nanny Ogg wrinkled her forehead. \u0027Our Darron\u0027s eldest was sick,\u0027 she said. \u0027Been at his dad\u0027s beer.\u0027 \u0027Unless he was extremely ill,\u0027 said Granny, \u0027I doubt if it was what I was referring to.\u0027 She made a complex occult sign in the air, which Nanny totally ignored. \u0027Someone tried to danee on the table,\u0027 she said. \u0027Fell into our Reet\u0027s pumpkin dip. We had a good laugh.\u0027 Granny waggled her eyebrows and placed a meaningful finger alongside her nose. \u0027I was alluding to things of a different nature,\u0027 she hinted darkly. Nanny Ogg peered at her. \u0027Something wrong with your eye, Esme?\u0027 she hazarded. Granny Weatherwax sighed. \u0027Extremely worrying developments of a magical tendency are even now afoot,\u0027 she said loudly. The room went quiet. Everyone stared at the witches, except for Darron\u0027s eldest, who took advantage of the opportunity to continue his alcoholic experiments. Then, swiftly as they had fled, several dozen conversations hurriedly got back into gear. \u0027It might be a good idea if we can go and talk somewhere more private,\u0027 said Granny, as the comforting hubbub streamed over them again. They ended up in the washhouse, where Granny tried to give an account of the mind she had encountered. \u0027It\u0027s out there somewhere, in the mountains and the high forests,\u0027 she said. \u0027And it is very big.\u0027 \u0027I thought it was looking for someone,\u0027 said Magrat. \u0027It put me in mind of a large dog. You know, lost. Puzzled.\u0027 Granny thought about this. Now she came to think of it . . . \u0027Yes,\u0027 she said. \u0027Something like that. A big dog.\u0027 \u0027Worried,\u0027 said Magrat. \u0027Searching,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027And getting angry,\u0027 said Magrat. \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Granny, staring fixedly at Nanny. \u0027Could be a troll,\u0027 said Nanny Ogg. \u0027I left best part of a pint in there, you know,\u0027 she added reproachfully. \u0027I know what a troll\u0027s mind feels like, Gytha,\u0027 said Granny. She didn\u0027t snap the words out. In fact it was the quiet way she said them that made Nanny hesitate. \u0027They say there\u0027s really big trolls up towards the Hub,\u0027 said Nanny slowly. \u0027And ice giants, and big hairy woss-names that live above the snowline. But you don\u0027t mean anything like that, do you?\u0027 \u0027No.\u0027 \u0027Oh.\u0027 Magrat shivered. She told herself that a witch had absolute control over her own body, and the goosepimples under her tun nightdress were just a figment of her own imagination. The trouble was, she had an excellent imagination. Nanny Ogg sighed. \u0027We\u0027d better have a look, then,\u0027 she said, and took the lid off the copper. Nanny Ogg never used her washhouse., since all her washing was done by the daughers-in-law, a tribe of grey-faced, subdued women whose names she never bothered to remember. It had become, therefore, a storage place for dried-up old bulbs, burnt-out cauldrons and fermenting jars of wasp jam. No fire had been lit under the copper for ten years. Its bricks were crumbling, and rare ferns grew around the firebox. The water under the lid was inky black and, according to rumour, bottomless; the Ogg grandchildren were encouraged to believe that monsters from the dawn of time dwelt in its depths, since Nanny believed that a bit of thrilling and pointless terror was an essential ingredient of the magic of childhood. In summer she used it as a beer cooler. \u0027It\u0027ll have to do. I think perhaps we should join hands,\u0027 she said. \u0027And you, Magrat, make sure the door\u0027s shut.\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wyrd-sisters-discworld-6/page-11.html","bookId":1625,"book":{"id":1625,"title":"Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6)","description":"Storyline: Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6) Witches are not by nature gregarious, and they certainly don\u0027t have leaders.
