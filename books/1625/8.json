{"id":95573,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"\u0027This is foolish,\u0027 he told himself. \u0027Marry, but is it foolish enough!\u0027\\n\\n He dozed off fitfully, into some sort of dream where a vague figure kept trying to attract his attention, and was only dimly aware of the voices of Lord and Lady Felmet on the other side of the door.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s certainly a lot less draughty,\u0027 said the duchess grudgingly.\\n\\n The duke sat back in the armchair and smiled at his wife.\\n\\n \u0027Well?\u0027 she demanded. \u0027Where are the witches?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The chamberlain would appear to be right, beloved. The witches seem to have the local people in thrall. The sergeant of the guard came back empty-handed.\u0027 Handed . . . he came down heavily on the importunate thought.\\n\\n \u0027You must have him executed,\u0027 she said promptly. \u0027To make an example to the others.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A course of action, my dear, which ultimately results in us ordering the last soldier to cut his own throat as an example to himself. By the way,\u0027 he added mildly, \u0027there would appear to be somewhat fewer servants around the place. You know I would not normally interfere—\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then don\u0027t,\u0027 she snapped. \u0027Housekeeping is under my control. I cannot abide slackness.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m sure you know best, but—\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What of these witches? Will you stand idly by and let trouble seed for thg future? Will you let these witches defy you? What of the crown?\u0027\\n\\n The duke shrugged. \u0027No doubt it ended in the river,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027And the child? He was given to the witches? Do they do human sacrifice?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It would appear not,\u0027 said the duke. The duchess looked vaguely disappointed.\\n\\n \u0027These witches,\u0027 said the duke. \u0027Apparently, they seem to cast a spell on people.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, obviously—\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not like a magic spell. They seem to be respected. They do medicine and so on. It\u0027s rather strange. The mountain people seem to be afraid of them and proud of them at the same time, It might be a little difficult to move against them.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I could come to believe,\u0027 said the duchess darkly, \u0027that they have cast a glamour over you as well.\u0027\\n\\n In fact the duke was intrigued. Power was always darkly fascinating, which was why he had married the duchess in the first place. He stared fixedly at the fire.\\n\\n \u0027In fact.\u0027 said the duchess, who recognised the malign smile, \u0027you like it, don\u0027t you? The thought of the danger. I remember when we were married; all that business with the knotted rope—\u0027\\n\\n She snapped her fingers in front of the duke\u0027s glazed eyes, He sat up.\\n\\n \u0027Not at all!\u0027 he shouted.\\n\\n \u0027Then what will you do?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Wait.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Waif?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Wait, and consider. Patience is a virtue.\u0027 The duke sat back. The smile he smiled could have spent a million years sitting on a rock. And then, just below one eye, he started to twitch. Blood was oozing between the bandages on his hand.\\n\\n Once again the full moon rode the clouds.\\n\\n Granny Weatherwax milked and fed the goats, banked me fire put a cloth over the minor and pulled her broomstick out from behind the door. She went out, locked the back door behind her, and hung the key on its nail in the privy.\\n\\n This was quite sufficient. Only once, in the entire history of witchery in the Ramtops, had a thief broken into a witch\u0027s cottage. The witch concerned visited the most terrible punishment on him.[4]\\n\\n Granny sat on the broom and muttered a few words, but without much conviction. After a further couple of tries she got off, fiddled with the binding, and had another go. There was a suspicion of glitter from one end of the stick, which quickly died away.\\n\\n \u0027Drat,\u0027 she said, under her breath.\\n\\n She looked around carefully, in case anyone was watching. In fact it was only a hunting badger who, hearing the thumping of running feet, poked its head out from the bushes and saw Granny hurtling down the path with the broomstick held stiff-armed beside her. At last the magic caught, and she managed to vault clumsily on to it before it trundled into the night sky as gracefully as a duck with one wing missing.\\n\\n From above the trees came a muffled curse against all dwarfish mechanics.\\n\\n Most witches preferred to live in isolated cottages with the traditional curly chimneys and weed-grown thatch. Granny Weatherwax approved of this; it was no good being a witch unless you let people know.\\n\\n Nanny Ogg didn\u0027t care much about what people knew and even less for what they thought, and lived in a new, knick-knack crammed cottage in the middle of Lancre town itself and at the heart of her own private empire. Various daughters and daughters-in-law came in to cook and clean on a sort of rota. Every flat surface was stuffed with ornaments brought back by far-travelling members of the family. Sons and grandsons kept the logpile stacked, the roof shingled, the chimney swept; the drinks cupboard was always full, the pouch by her rocking chair always stuffed with tobacco. Above the hearth was a huge pokerwork sign saying \u0027Mother\u0027. No tyrant in the whole history of the world had ever achieved a domination so complete.\\n\\n Nanny Ogg also kept a cat, a huge one-eyed grey torn called Greebo who divided his time between sleeping, eating and fathering the most enormous incestuous feline tribe. He opened his eye like a yellow window into Hell when he heard Granny\u0027s broomstick land awkwardly on the back lawn. With the instinct of his kind he recognised Granny as an inveterate cat-hater and oozed gently under a chair.\\n\\n Magrat was already seated primly by the fire.\\n\\n It is one of the few unbendable rules of magic that its practitioners cannot change their own appearance for any length of time. Their bodies develop a kind of morphic inertia and gradually return to their original shape. But Magrat tried. Every morning her hair was long, thick and blond, but by the evening it had always returned to its normal worried frizz. To ameliorate the effect she had tried to plait violets and cowslips in it. The result was not all she had hoped. It gave the impression that a window box had fallen on her head.\\n\\n \u0027Good evening,\u0027 said Granny.\\n\\n \u0027Well met by moonlight,\u0027 said Magrat politely. \u0027Merry meet. A star shines on—\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Wotcha,\u0027 said Nanny Ogg. Magrat winced.\\n\\n Granny sat down and started removing the pins that nailed her tall hat to her bun. Finally the sight of Magrat dawned on her.\\n\\n \u0027Magrat!\u0027\\n\\n The young witch jumped, and clamped her knuckly hands to the virtuous frontage of her gown.\\n\\n \u0027Yes?\u0027 she quavered.\\n\\n \u0027What have you got on your lap?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s my familiar,\u0027 she said defensively.\\n\\n \u0027What happened to that toad you had?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It wandered off,\u0027 muttered Magrat. \u0027Anyway, it wasn\u0027t very good.\u0027\\n\\n Granny sighed. Magrat\u0027s desperate search for a reliable familiar had been going on for some time, and despite the love and attention she lavished on them they all seemed to have some terrible flaw, such as a tendency to bite, get trodden on or, in extreme cases, metamorphose.\\n\\n \u0027That makes fifteen this year,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027Not counting the horse. What\u0027s this one?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s a rock,\u0027 chuckled Nanny Ogg.\\n\\n \u0027Well, at least it should last,\u0027 said Granny.\\n\\n The rock extended a head and gave her a look of mild amusement.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s a tortoyse,\u0027 said Magrat. \u0027I bought it down in Sheep-ridge market. It\u0027s incredibly old and knows many secrets, the man said.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I know that man,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027He\u0027s the one who sells goldfish that tarnish after a day or two.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Anyway, I shall call him Lightfoot,\u0027 said Magrat, her voice warm with defiance. \u0027I can if I want.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, yes, all right, I\u0027m sure,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027Anyway, how goes it, sisters? It is two months since last we met.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It should be every new moon,\u0027 said Magrat sternly. \u0027Regular.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It was our Grame\u0027s youngest\u0027s wedding,\u0027 said Nanny Ogg. \u0027Couldn\u0027t miss it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And I was up all night with a sick goat,\u0027 said Granny Weatherwax promptly.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, well,\u0027 said Magrat doubtfully. She rummaged in her bag. \u0027Anyway, if we\u0027re going to start, we\u0027d better light the candles.\u0027\\n\\n The senior witches exchanged a resigned glance.\\n\\n \u0027But we got this lovely new lamp our Tracie sent me,\u0027 said Nanny Ogg innocently. \u0027And I was going to poke up the fire a bit.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I have excellent night vision, Magrat,\u0027 said Granny sternly. \u0027And you\u0027ve been reading them funny books. Grimmers.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Grimoires—\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You ain\u0027t going to draw on the floor again, neither,\u0027 warned Nanny Ogg. \u0027It took our Dreen days to clean up all those wossnames last time—\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Runes,\u0027 said Magrat. There was a look of pleading in her eyes. \u0027Look, just one candle?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All right,\u0027 said Nanny Ogg, relenting a bit. \u0027If it makes you feel any better. Just the one, mind. And a decent white one. Nothing fancy.\u0027\\n\\n Magrat sighed. It probably wasn\u0027t a good idea to bring out the rest of the contents of her bag.\\n\\n \u0027We ought to get a few more here,\u0027 she said sadly. \u0027It\u0027s not right, a coven of three.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I didn\u0027t know we was still a coven. No-one told me we was still a coven,\u0027 sniffed Granny Weatherwax. \u0027Anyway, there\u0027s no-one else this side of the mountain, excepting old Gammer Dismass, and she doesn\u0027t get out these days.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But a lot of young girls in my village . . .\u0027 said Magrat. \u0027You know. They could be keen.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s not how we do it, as well you know,\u0027 said Granny disapprovingly. \u0027People don\u0027t go and find witchcraft, it comes and finds them.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, yes,\u0027 said Magrat. \u0027Sorry.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Right,\u0027 said Granny, slightly mollified. She\u0027d never mastered the talent for apologising, but she appreciated it in other people.\\n\\n \u0027What about this new duke, then,\u0027 said Nanny, to lighten the atmosphere.\\n\\n Granny sat back. \u0027He had some houses burned down in Bad Ass,\u0027 she said. \u0027Because of taxes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How horrible,\u0027 said Magrat.\\n\\n \u0027Old Kind Verence used to do that,\u0027 said Nanny. \u0027Terrible temper he had.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He used to let people get out first, though,\u0027 said Granny.\\n\\n \u0027Oh yes,\u0027 said Nanny, who was a staunch royalist. \u0027He could be very gracious like that. He\u0027d pay for them to be rebuilt, as often as not. If he remembered.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And every Hogswatchnight, a side of venison. Regular,\u0027 said Granny wistfully.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, yes. Very respectful to witches, he was,\u0027 added Nanny Ogg. \u0027When he was out hunting people, if he met me in the woods, it was always off with his helmet and “I hope I finds you well, Mistress Ogg” and next day he\u0027d send his butler down with a couple of bottles of something. He was a proper king.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hunting people isn\u0027t really right, though,\u0027 said Magrat.\\n\\n \u0027Well, no,\u0027 Granny Weatherwax conceded. \u0027But it was only if they\u0027d done something bad. He said they enjoyed it really. And he used to let them go if they gave him a good run,\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And then there was that great hairy thing of his,\u0027 said Nanny Ogg.\\n\\n There was a perceptible change in the atmosphere. It became warmer, darker, filled at the corners with the shadows of unspoken conspiracy.\\n\\n \u0027Ah,\u0027 said Granny Weatherwax distantly. \u0027His droit de seigneur.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Needed a lot of exercise,\u0027 said Nanny Ogg, staring at the fire.\\n\\n \u0027But next day he\u0027d send his housekeeper round with a bag of silver and a hamper of stuff for the wedding,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027Many a couple got a proper start in life thanks to that.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ah,\u0027 agreed Nanny. \u0027One or two individuals, too.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Every inch a king,\u0027 said Granny.\\n\\n \u0027What are you talking about?\u0027 said Magrat suspiciously. \u0027Did he keep pets?\u0027\\n\\n The two witches surfaced from whatever deeper current they had been swimming in. Granny Weatherwax shrugged.\\n\\n \u0027I must say,\u0027 Magrat went on, in severe tones, \u0027if you think so much of the old king, you don\u0027t seem very worried about him being killed. I mean, it was a pretty suspicious accident.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s kings for you,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027They come and go, good and bad. His father poisoned the king we had before.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That was old Thargum,\u0027 said Nanny Ogg. \u0027Had a big red beard, I recall. He was very gracious too, you know.\u0027 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wyrd-sisters-discworld-6/page-8.html","bookId":1625,"book":{"id":1625,"title":"Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6)","description":"Storyline: Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6) \\n Witches are not by nature gregarious, and they certainly don\u0027t have leaders.
