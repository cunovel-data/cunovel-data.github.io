{"id":95601,"no":37,"title":"Page 37","content":"The duke crouched in his seat, his face a panorama of fear. He extended what had once been a finger.\\n\\n \u0027There they are,\u0027 he breathed. \u0027That\u0027s them. What are they doing in my play? Who said they could be in my play?\u0027\\n\\n The duchess, who was less inclined to deal in rhetorical questions, beckoned to the nearest guard.\\n\\n On stage Tomjon was sweating under the load of the script. Wimsloe was incoherent. Now Gumridge, who was playing the part of the Good Duchess in a wig of flax, had lost the thread as well.\\n\\n \u0027Aha, thou callst me an evil king, though thou wisperest it so none save I may hear it,\u0027 Tomjon croaked. \u0027And thou hast summoned the guard, possibly by some most secret signal, owing nought to artifice of lips or tongue.\u0027\\n\\n A guard came on crabwise, still stumbling from Hwel\u0027s shove. He stared at Granny Weatherwax.\\n\\n \u0027Hwel says what the hell\u0027s going on?\u0027 he hissed.\\n\\n \u0027What was that?\u0027 said Tomjon. \u0027Did I hear you say / come, my lady?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Get these people off, he says!\u0027\\n\\n Tomjon advanced to the front of the stage.\\n\\n \u0027Thou babblest, man. See how I dodge thy tortoise spear. I said, see how I dodge thy tortoise spear. Thy spear, man. You\u0027re holding it in thy bloody hand, for goodness\u0027 sake.\u0027\\n\\n The guard gave him a desperate, frozen grin.\\n\\n Tomjon hesitated. Three other actors around him were staring fixedly at the witches. Looming up in front of him with all the inevitability of a tax demand was a sword fight during which, it was beginning to appear, he would have to parry his own wild thrusts and stab himself to death.\\n\\n He turned to the three witches. His mouth opened.\\n\\n For the first time in his life his awesome memory let him down. He could think of nothing to say.\\n\\n Granny Weatherwax stood up. She advanced to the edge of the stage. The audience held its breath. She held up a hand.\\n\\n \u0027Ghosts of the mind and all device away, I bid the Truth to have—\u0027 she hesitated – \u0027its tumpty-tumpty day.\u0027\\n\\n Tomjon felt the chill engulf him. The others, too, jolted into life.\\n\\n Up from out of the depths of their blank minds new words rushed, words red with blood and revenge, words that had echoed among the castle\u0027s stones, words stored in silicon, words that would have themselves heard, words that gripped their mouths so tightly that an attempt not to say them would result in a broken jaw.\\n\\n \u0027Do you fear him now?\u0027 said Gumridge. \u0027And he so mazed with drink? Take his dagger, husband – you are a blade\u0027s width from the kingdom.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I dare not,\u0027 Wimsloe said, trying to look in astonishment at his own lips.\\n\\n \u0027Who will know?\u0027 Gumridge waved a hand towards the audience. He\u0027d never act so well again. \u0027See, there is only eyeless night. Take the dagger now, take the kingdom tomorrow. Have a stab at it, man.\u0027\\n\\n Wimsloe\u0027s hand shook.\\n\\n \u0027I have it, wife,\u0027 he said. \u0027Is this a dagger I see before me?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Of course it\u0027s a bloody dagger. Come on, do it now. The weak deserve no mercy. We\u0027ll say he fell down the stairs.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But people will suspect!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Are there no dungeons? Are there no pilliwinks? Possession is nine parts of the law, husband, when what you possess is a knife.\u0027\\n\\n Wimsloe drew his arm back.\\n\\n \u0027I cannot! He has been kindness itself to me!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And you can be Death itself to him . . .\u0027\\n\\n Dafe could hear the voices a long way off. He adjusted his mask, checked the deathliness of his appearance in the mirror, and peered at the script in the empty backstage gloom.\\n\\n \u0027Cower Now, Brief Mortals,\u0027 he said. \u0027I Am Death, \u0027Gainst Who – \u0027Gainst Who—\u0027\\n\\n WHOM.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, thanks,\u0027 said the boy distractedly. \u0027 \u0027Gainst Whom No Lock May Hold—\u0027\\n\\n WILL HOLD.\\n\\n \u0027Will Hold Nor Fasten\u0027d Portal Bar, Here To – to – to\u0027\\n\\n HERE TO TAKE MY TALLY ON THIS NIGHT OF KINGS.\\n\\n Dafe sagged.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re so much better at it,\u0027 he moaned. \u0027You\u0027ve got the right voice and you can remember the words.\u0027 He turned around. \u0027It\u0027s only three lines and Hwel will . . . have . . . my . . . guts . . . for.\u0027\\n\\n He froze. His eyes widened and became two saucers of fear as Death snapped his fingers in front of the boy\u0027s rigid face.\\n\\n FORGET, he commanded, and turned and stalked silently towards the wings.\\n\\n His eyeless skull took in the line of costumes, the waxy debris of the makeup table. His empty nostrils snuffed up the mixed smells of mothballs, grease and sweat.\\n\\n There was something here, he thought, that nearly belonged to the gods. Humans had built a world inside the world, which reflected it in pretty much the same way as a drop of water reflects the landscape. And yet . . . and yet . . .\\n\\n Inside this little world they had taken pains to put all the things, you might think they would want to escape from – hatred, fear, tyranny, and so forth. Death was intrigued. They thought they wanted to be taken out of themselves, and every art humans dreamt up took them further in. He was fascinated.\\n\\n He was here for a very particular and precise purpose. There was a soul to be claimed. There was no time for inconsequentialities. But what was time, after all?\\n\\n His feet did an involuntary little clicking dance across the stones. Alone, in the grey shadows, Death tapdanced.\\n\\n —THE NEXT NIGHT IN YOUR DRESSING ROOM THEY HANG A STAR—\\n\\n He pulled himself together, adjusted his scythe, and waited silently for his cue.\\n\\n He\u0027d never missed one yet.\\n\\n He was going to get out there and slay them.\\n\\n \u0027And you can be Death itself to him. Now!\u0027 Death entered, his feet clicking across the stage. COWER NOW, BRIEF MORTALS, he said, FOR I AM DEATH, \u0027GAINST WHOM NO . . . NO . . . \u0027GAINST WHOM . . .\\n\\n He hesitated. He hesitated, for the very first time in the eternity of his existence.\\n\\n For although the Death of the Discworld was used to dealing with people by the million, at the same time every death was intimate and personal.\\n\\n Death was seldom seen except by those of an occult persuasion and his clients themselves. The reason that no-one else saw him was that the human brain is clever enough to edit sights too horrible for it to cope with, but the problem here was that several hundred people were in fact expecting to see Death at this point, and were therefore seeing him.\\n\\n Death turned slowly and stared back at hundreds of watching eyes.\\n\\n Even in the grip of the truth Tomjon recognised a fellow actor in distress, and fought for mastery of his lips.\\n\\n \u0027 “. . . lock will hold . . .” \u0027 he whispered, through teeth fixed in a grimace.\\n\\n Death gave him a manic grin of stagefright.\\n\\n WHAT? he whispered, in a voice like an anvil being hit with a small lead hammer.\\n\\n \u0027 “. . . lock will hold, nor fasten\u0027d portal . . .”,\u0027 said Tomjon encouragingly.\\n\\n . . . LOCK WILL HOLD NOR FASTEN\u0027D PORTAL . . . UH . . . repeated Death desperately, watching his lips.\\n\\n \u0027 “. . . bar! . . .” \u0027\\n\\n BAR.\\n\\n \u0027No, I cannot do it!\u0027 said Wimsloe. \u0027I will be seen! Down there in the hall, someone watches!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There is no-one!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I feel the stare!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Dithering idiot! Must I put it in for you? See, his foot is upon the top stair!\u0027\\n\\n Wimsloe\u0027s face contorted with fear and uncertainty. He drew back his hand.\\n\\n \u0027No!\u0027\\n\\n The scream came from the audience. The duke was half-risen from his seat, his tortured knuckles at his mouth. As they watched he lurched forward between the shocked people.\\n\\n \u0027No! I did not do it! It was not like that! You cannot say it was like that! You were not there!\u0027 He stared at the upturned faces around him, and sagged.\\n\\n \u0027Nor was I,\u0027 he giggled. \u0027I was asleep at the time, you know. I remember it quite well. There was blood on the counterpane, there was blood on the floor, I could not wash off the blood, but these are not proper subjects for the inquiry. I cannot allow the discussion of national security. It was just a dream, and when I awoke, he\u0027d be alive tomorrow. And tomorrow it wouldn\u0027t have happened because it was not done. And tomorrow you can say I did not know. And tomorrow you can say I had no recollection. What a noise he made in falling! Enough to wake the dead . . . who would have thought he had so much blood in him? . . .\u0027 By now he had climbed on to the stage, and grinned brightly at the assembled company.\\n\\n \u0027I hope that sorts it all out,\u0027 he said. \u0027Ha. Ha.\u0027\\n\\n In the silence that followed Tomjon opened his mouth to utter something suitable, something soothing, and found that there was nothing he could say.\\n\\n But another personality stepped into him, took over his lips, and spoke thusly:\\n\\n \u0027With my own bloody dagger, you bastard! I know it was you! I saw you at the top of the stairs, sucking your thumb! I\u0027d kill you now, except for the thought of having to spend eternity listening to your whining. I, Verence, formerly King of-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What testimony is this?\u0027 said the duchess. She stood in front of the stage, with half a dozen soldiers beside her.\\n\\n \u0027These are just slanders,\u0027 she added. \u0027And treason to boot. The rantings of mad players.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I was bloody King of Lancre!\u0027 shouted Tomjon.\\n\\n \u0027In which case you are the alleged victim,\u0027 said the duchess calmly. \u0027And unable to speak for the prosecution. It is against all precedent.\u0027\\n\\n Tomjon\u0027s body turned towards Death.\\n\\n \u0027You were there! You saw it all!\u0027\\n\\n I SUSPECT I WOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AN APPROPRIATE WITNESS.\\n\\n \u0027Therefore there is no proof, and where there is no proof there is no crime,\u0027 said the duchess. She motioned the soldiers forward.\\n\\n \u0027So much for your experiment,\u0027 she said to her husband. \u0027I think my way is better.\u0027\\n\\n She looked around the stage, and found the witches.\\n\\n \u0027Arrest them,\u0027 she said.\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 said the Fool, stepping out of the wings.\\n\\n \u0027What did you say?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I saw it all,\u0027 said the Fool, simply. \u0027I was in the Great Hall that night. You killed the king, my lord.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I did not!\u0027 screamed the duke. \u0027You were not there! I did not see you there! I order you not to be there!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You did not dare say this before,\u0027 said Lady Felmet.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, lady. But I must say it now.\u0027\\n\\n The duke focused unsteadily on him.\\n\\n \u0027You swore loyalty unto death, my Fool,\u0027 he hissed.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, my lord. I\u0027m sorry.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re dead.\u0027\\n\\n The duke snatched a dagger from Wimsloe\u0027s-unresisting hand, darted forward, and plunged it to the hilt into the Fool\u0027s heart. Magrat screamed.\\n\\n The Fool rocked back and forth unsteadily.\\n\\n \u0027Thank goodness that\u0027s over,\u0027 he said, as Magrat pushed her way through the actors and clasped him to what could charitably be called her bosom. It struck the Fool that he had never looked a bosom squarely in the face, at least since he was a baby, and it was particularly cruel of the world to save the experience until after he was dead.\\n\\n He gently moved one of Magrat\u0027s arms and pulled the despicable horned cowl from his head, and tossed it as far as possible. He didn\u0027t have to be a Fool any more or, he realised, bother about vows or anything. What with bosoms as well, death seemed to be an improvement.\\n\\n \u0027I didn\u0027t do it,\u0027 said the duke.\\n\\n No pain, thought the Fool. Funny, that. On the other hand, you obviously can\u0027t feel pain when you are dead. It would be wasted.\\n\\n \u0027You all saw that I didn\u0027t do it,\u0027 said the duke.\\n\\n Death gave the Fool a puzzled look. Then he reached into the recesses of his robes and pulled out an hourglass. It had bells on it. He gave it a gentle shake, which made them tinkle.\\n\\n \u0027I gave no orders that any such thing should be done,\u0027 said the duke calmly. His voice came from a long way off, from wherever his mind was now. The company stared at him wordlessly. It wasn\u0027t possible to hate someone like this, only to feel acutely embarrassed about being anywhere near him. Even the Fool felt embarrassed, and he was dead.\\n\\n Death tapped the hourglass, and then peered at it to see if it had gone wrong. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wyrd-sisters-discworld-6/page-37.html","bookId":1625,"book":{"id":1625,"title":"Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6)","description":"Storyline: Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6) \\n Witches are not by nature gregarious, and they certainly don\u0027t have leaders.
