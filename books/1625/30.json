{"id":95595,"no":30,"title":"Page 30","content":"\u0027So we can tell this Fool that we\u0027ll do it, can we?\u0027 said Vitoller, his hand on the bag of silver.\n And of course you couldn\u0027t go wrong with a good storm. And there was the ghost routine that Vitoller had cut out of Please Yourself, saying they couldn\u0027t afford the muslin. And perhaps he could put Death in, too. Young Dafe would make a damn good Death, with white makeup and platform soles . . .\n \u0027How far away did he say he\u0027d come from?\u0027 he said.\n \u0027The Ramtops,\u0027 said the playmaster. \u0027Some little kingdom no-one has ever heard of. Sounds like a chest infection.\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027d take months to get there.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027d like to go, anyway,\u0027 said Tomjon. \u0027That\u0027s where I was born.\u0027\n Vitoller looked at the ceiling. Hwel looked at the floor. Anything was better, just at that moment, than looking at each other\u0027s face.\n \u0027That\u0027s what you said,\u0027 said the boy. \u0027When you did a tour of the mountains, you said.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, but I can\u0027t remember where,\u0027 said Vitoller. \u0027All those little mountain towns looked the same to me. We spent more time pushing the lattys across rivers and dragging them up hills than we ever did on the stage.\u0027\n \u0027I could take some of the younger lads and we could make a summer of it,\u0027 said Tomjon. \u0027Put on all the old favourites. And we could still be back by Soulcake Day. You could stay here and see to the theatre, and we could be back for a Grand Opening.\u0027 He grinned at his father. \u0027It\u0027d be good for them,\u0027 he said slyly. \u0027You always said some of the young lads don\u0027t know what a real acting life is like.\u0027\n \u0027Hwel\u0027s still got to write the play,\u0027 Vitoller pointed out.\n Hwel was silent. He was staring at nothing at all. After a while one hand fumbled in his doublet and brought out a sheaf of paper, and then disappeared in the direction of his belt and produced a small corked ink pot and a bundle of quills.\n They watched as, without once looking at them, the dwarf smoothed out the paper, opened the ink pot, dipped a quill, held it poised like a hawk waiting for its prey, and then began to write.\n Vitoller nodded at Tomjon.\n Walking as quietly as they could, they left the room.\n Around mid-afternoon they took up a tray of food and a bundle of paper.\n The tray was still there at teatime. The paper had gone.\n A few hours later a passing member of the company reported hearing a yell of \u0027It can\u0027t work! It\u0027s back to front!\u0027 and the sound of something being thrown across the room.\n Around supper Vitoller heard a shouted request for more candles and fresh quills.\n Tomjon tried to get an early night, but sleep was murdered by the sound of creativity from the next room. There were mutterings about balconies, and whether the world really needed wave machines. The rest was silence, except for the insistent scratching of quills.\n Eventually, Tomjon dreamed.\n \u0027Now. Have we got everything this time?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, Granny.\u0027\n \u0027Light the fire, Magrat.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, Granny.\u0027\n \u0027Right. Let\u0027s see now—\u0027\n \u0027I wrote it all down, Granny.\u0027\n \u0027I can read, my girl, thank you very much. Now, what\u0027s this. “Round about the cauldron go, In the poisoned entrails throw . . .” What are these supposed to be?\u0027\n \u0027Our Jason slaughtered a pig yesterday, Esme.\u0027\n \u0027These look like perfectly good chitterlin\u0027s to me, Gytha. There\u0027s a couple of decent meals in them, if I\u0027m any judge.\u0027\n \u0027Please, Granny.\u0027\n \u0027There\u0027s plenty of starvin\u0027 people in Klatch who wouldn \u0027t\n turn up their nose at \u0027em, that\u0027s all I\u0027m saying . . . All right, all right. “Whole grain wheat and lentils too, In the cauldron seethe and stew”? What happened to the toad?\u0027\n \u0027Please, Granny. You \u0027re slowing it down. You know Goodie was against all unnecessary cruelty. Vegetable protein is a perfectly acceptable substitute.\u0027\n \u0027That means no newt or fenny snake either, I suppose?\u0027\n \u0027No, Granny.\u0027\n \u0027Or tiger\u0027s chaudron?\u0027\n \u0027Here.\u0027\n \u0027What the hell\u0027s this, excuse my Klatchian?\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s a tiger\u0027s chaudron, Our Wane brought it off a merchant from forn parts.\u0027\n \u0027You sure?\u0027\n \u0027Our Wane asked special, Esme.\u0027\n \u0027Looks like any other chaudron to me. Oh, well. “Double nubble, stubble trouble, Fire burn and cauldron bub—” WHY isn\u0027t the cauldron bubbling, Magrat?\u0027\n Tomjon awoke, shivering. The room was dark. Outside a few stars pierced the mists of the city, and there was the occasional whistle of burglars and footpads as they went about their strictly lawful occasions.\n There was silence from the next room, but he could see the light of a candle under the door.\n He went back to bed.\n Across the turgid river the Fool had also awakened. He was staying in the Fool\u0027s Guild, not out of choice but because the duke hadn\u0027t given him any money for anything else, and getting to sleep had been difficult in any case. The chilly walls had brought back too many memories. Besides, if he listened hard he could hear the muted sobs and occasional whimpers from the students\u0027 dormitories, as they contemplated with horror the life that lay ahead of them.\n He punched the rock-hard pillow, and sank into a fitful sleep. Perchance to dream.\n \u0027Slab and grue, yes. But it doesn \u0027t say how slab and grue.\u0027\n \u0027Goodie Whemper recommended testing a bit in a cup of cold water, like toffee.\u0027\n \u0027How inconvenient that we didn\u0027t think to bring one, Magrat.\u0027\n \u0027I think we should begettingon, Esme. The night\u0027s nearly gone.\u0027\n \u0027Just don\u0027t blame me if it doesn\u0027t work properly, that\u0027s all.\n Lessee . . . “Baboon hair and . . .” Who\u0027s got the baboon hair? Oh, thank you, Gytha, though it looks more like cat hair to me, but never mind. “Baboon hair and mandrake root”, and if that\u0027s real mandrake I\u0027m very surprised, “carrot juice and tongue of boot”, I see, a little humour, I suppose . . .\u0027\n \u0027Please hurry!\u0027\n \u0027All right, all right. “Owl hoot and glow-worm glimmer. Boil – and then allow to simmer.” \u0027\n \u0027You know, Esme, this doesn\u0027t taste half bad.\u0027\n \u0027You \u0027re not supposed to drink it, you daft doyenne!\u0027\n Tomjon sat bolt upright in bed. That was them again, the same faces, the bickering voices, distorted by tune and space.\n Even after he looked out of the window, where fresh daylight was streaming through the city, he could still hear the voices grumbling into the distance, like old thunder, fading away . . .\n \u0027I for one didn\u0027t believe it about the tongue of boot.\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s still very runny. Do you think we should put some cornflour into it?\u0027\n \u0027It won\u0027t matter. Either he\u0027s on his way, or he isn \u0027t. . .\u0027\n He got up and doused his face in the washbasin.\n Silence rolled in swathes from Hwel\u0027s room. Tomjon slipped on his clothes and pushed open the door.\n It looked as though it had snowed indoors, great heavy flakes that had drifted into odd corners of the room. Hwel sat at his low table in the middle of the floor, his head pillowed on a pile of paper, snoring.\n Tomjon tiptoed across the room and piled up a discarded ball of paper at random. He smoothed it out and read:\n KING: Now, I\u0027m just going to put the crown on this bush here, and you will tell me if anyone tries to take it, won\u0027t you?\n GROUNDLINGS: Yes!\n KING: Now if I could just find my horsey . . .\n (1st assassin pops up behind rock.)\n AUDIENCE: Behind you!\n (1st assassin disappears.)\n KING: You\u0027re trying to play tricks on old Kingy, you...\n There was a lot of crossing out, and a large blot. Tomjon threw it aside and selected another ball at random.\n KING: Is this a duck knife dagger I see behind beside in front of before me, its beak handle pointing at me my hand?\n 1ST MURDERER: I\u0027faith, it is not so. Oh, no it isn\u0027t!\n 2ND MURDERER: Thou speakest truth, sire. Oh, yes it is!\n Judging by the creases in the paper, this one had been thrown at the wall particularly hard. Hwel had once explained to Tomjon his theory about inspirations, and by the look of it a whole shower had fallen last night.\n Fascinated by this insight into the creative processes, however, Tomjon tried a third discarded attempt:\n QUEEN: Faith, there is a sound without! Mayhap it is my husband returning! Quick, into the garderobe, and wait not upon the order of your going!\n MURDERER: Marry, but your maid still has my pantoufles!\n MAID (opening door): The Archbishop, your majesty.\n PRIEST (under bed): Bless my soul!\n (Divers alarums)\n Tomjon wondered vaguely what divers alarums, which Hwel always included somewhere in the stage directions, actually were. Hwel always refused to say. Perhaps they referred to dangerous depths, or lack of air pressure.\n He sidled towards the table and, with great care, pulled the sheaf of paper from under the sleeping dwarfs head, lowering it gently on to a cushion.\n The top sheet read:\n Verence Felmet Small God\u0027s Eve A Night Of Knives Daggers Kings, by, Hwel of Vitoller\u0027s Men. A Comedy Tragedy in Eight Five Six Three Nine Acts.\n Characters: Felmet, A Good King.\n Verence, A Bad King.\n Wethewacs, Ane Evil Witch\n Hogg, Ane Likewise Evil Witch\n Magerat, Ane Sirene . . .\n Tomjon flicked over the page.\n Scene: A Drawing Room Ship at See Street in Pseudopolis Blasted Moor. Enter Three Witches . . .\n The boy read for a while and then turned to the last page.\n Gentles, leave us dance and sing, and wish good health unto the king (Exeunt all, singing falala, etc. Shower of rose petals. Ringing of bells. Gods descend from heaven, demons rise from hell, much ado with turntable, etc.) The End.\n Hwel snored.\n In his dreams gods rose and fell, ships moved with cunning and art across canvas oceans, pictures jumped and ran together and became flickering images; men flew on wires, flew without wires, great ships of illusion fought against one another in imaginary skies, seas opened, ladies were sawn in half, a thousand special effects men giggled and gibbered. Through it all he ran with his arms open in desperation, knowing that none of this really existed or ever would exist and all he really had was a few square yards of planking, some canvas and some paint on which to trap the beckoning images that invaded his head.\n Only in our dreams are we free. The rest of the time we need wages.\n \u0027It\u0027s a good play,\u0027 said Vitoller, \u0027apart from the ghost.\u0027\n \u0027The ghost stays,\u0027 said Hwel sullenly.\n \u0027But people always jeer and throw things. Anyway, you know how hard it is to get all the chalk dust out of the clothes.\u0027\n \u0027The ghost stays. It\u0027s a dramatic necessity.\u0027\n \u0027You said it was a dramatic necessity in the last play.\u0027\n \u0027Well, it was.\u0027\n \u0027And in Please Yourself, and in A Wizard of Ankh, and all the rest of them.\u0027\n \u0027I like ghosts.\u0027\n They stood to one side and watched the dwarf artificers assembling the wave machine. It consisted of half a dozen long spindles, covered in complex canvas spirals painted in shades of blue and green and white, and stretching the complete width of the stage. An arrangement of cogs and endless belts led to a treadmill in the wings. When the spirals were all turning at once people with weak stomachs had to look away.\n \u0027Sea battles,\u0027 breathed Hwel. \u0027Shipwrecks. Tritons. Pirates!\u0027\n \u0027Squeaky bearings, laddie,\u0027 groaned Vitoller, shifting his weight on his stick. \u0027Maintenance expenses. Overtime.\u0027\n \u0027It does look extremely . . . intricate,\u0027 Hwel admitted. \u0027Who designed it?\u0027\n \u0027A daft old chap in the Street of Cunning Artificers,\u0027 said Vitoller. \u0027Leonard of Quirm. He\u0027s a painter really. He just does this sort of thing for a hobby. I happened to hear that he\u0027s been working on this for months. I just snapped it up quick when he couldn\u0027t get it to fly.\u0027\n They watched the mock waves turn.\n \u0027You\u0027re bent on going?\u0027 said Vitoller, at last. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wyrd-sisters-discworld-6/page-30.html","bookId":1625,"book":{"id":1625,"title":"Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6)","description":"Storyline: \n Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6) \n Witches are not by nature gregarious, and they certainly don\u0027t have leaders.
