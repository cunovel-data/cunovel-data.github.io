{"id":95596,"no":31,"title":"Page 31","content":"\u0027Yes. Tomjon\u0027s still a bit wild. He needs an older head around the place.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll miss you, laddie. I don\u0027t mind telling you. You\u0027ve been like a son to me. How old are you, exactly? I never did know.\u0027 \u0027A hundred and two.\u0027 Vitoller nodded gloomily. He was sixty, and his arthritis was playing him up. \u0027You\u0027ve been like a father to me, then,\u0027 he said. \u0027It evens out in the end,\u0027 said Hwel diffidently. \u0027Half the height, twice the age. You could say that on the overall average we live about the same length of time as humans.\u0027 The playmaster sighed. \u0027Well, I don\u0027t know what I will do without you and Tomjon around, and that\u0027s a fact.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s only for the summer, and a lot of the lads are staying. In fact it\u0027s mainly the apprentices that are going. You said yourself it\u0027d be good experience.\u0027 Vitoller looked wretched and, in the chilly air of the half-finished theatre, a good deal smaller than usual, like a balloon two weeks after the party. He prodded some wood shavings distractedly with his stick. \u0027We grow old, Master Hwel. At least,\u0027 he corrected himself, \u0027I grow old and you grow older. We have heard the gongs at midnight.\u0027 \u0027Aye. You don\u0027t want him to go, do you?\u0027 \u0027I was all for it at first. You know. Then I thought, there\u0027s destiny afoot. Just when things are going well, there\u0027s always bloody destiny. I mean, that\u0027s where he came from. Somewhere up in the mountains. Now fate is calling him back. I shan\u0027t see him again.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s only for the summer—\u0027 Vitoller held up a hand. \u0027Don\u0027t interrupt. I\u0027d got the right dramatic flow there.\u0027 \u0027Sorry.\u0027 Flick, flick, went the stick on the wood shavings, knocking them into the air. \u0027I mean, you know he\u0027s not my flesh and blood.\u0027 \u0027He\u0027s your son, though,\u0027 said Hwel. \u0027This hereditary business isn\u0027t all it\u0027s cracked up to be.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s fine of you to say that.\u0027 \u0027I mean it. Look at me. I wasn\u0027t supposed to be writing plays. Dwarfs aren\u0027t even supposed to be able to read. I shouldn\u0027t worry too much about destiny, if I was you. I was destined to be a miner. Destiny gets it wrong half the time.\u0027 \u0027But you said he looks like the Fool person. I can\u0027t see it myself, mark you.\u0027 \u0027The light\u0027s got to be right.\u0027 \u0027Could be some destiny at work there.\u0027 Hwel shrugged. Destiny was funny stuff, he knew. You couldn\u0027t trust it. Often you couldn\u0027t even see it. Just when you knew you had it cornered, it turned out to be something else – coincidence, maybe, or providence. You barred the door against it, and it was standing behind you. Then just when you thought you had it nailed down it walked away with the hammer. He used destiny a lot. As a tool for his plays it was even better than a ghost. There was nothing like a bit of destiny to get the old plot rolling. But it was a mistake to think you could spot the shape of it. And as for thinking it could be controlled . . . Granny Weatherwax squinted irritably into Nanny Ogg\u0027s crystal ball. It wasn\u0027t a particularly good one, being a greenish glass fishing float brought back from forn seaside parts by one of her sons. It distorted everything including, she suspected, the truth. \u0027He\u0027s definitely on his way,\u0027 she said, at last. \u0027In a cart.\u0027 \u0027A fiery white charger would have been favourite,\u0027 said Nanny Ogg. \u0027You know. Caparisoned, and that.\u0027 \u0027Has he got a magic sword?\u0027 said Magrat, craning to see. Granny Weatherwax sat back. \u0027You\u0027re a disgrace, the pair of you,\u0027 she said. \u0027I don\u0027t know – magic chargers, fiery swords. Ogling away like a couple of milkmaids.\u0027 \u0027A magic sword is important,\u0027 said Magrat. \u0027You\u0027ve got to have one. We could make him one,\u0027 she added wistfully. \u0027Out of thunderbolt iron. I\u0027ve got a spell for that. You take some thunderbolt iron,\u0027 she said uncertainly, \u0027and then you make a sword out of it.\u0027 \u0027I can\u0027t be having with that old stuff,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027You can wait days for the damn things to hit and then they nearly take your arm off.\u0027 \u0027And a strawberry birthmark,\u0027 said Nanny Ogg, ignoring the interruption. The other two looked at her expectantly. \u0027A strawberry birthmark,\u0027 she repeated. \u0027It\u0027s one of those things you\u0027ve got to have if you\u0027re a prince coming to claim your kingdom. That\u0027s so\u0027s everyone will know. O\u0027course, I don\u0027t know how they know it\u0027s strawberry.\u0027 \u0027Can\u0027t abide strawberries,\u0027 said Granny vaguely, quizzing the crystal again. In its cracked green depths, smelling of bygone lobsters, a minute Tomjon kissed his parents, shook hands or hugged the rest of the company, and climbed aboard the leading latty. It must of worked, she told herself. Else he wouldn\u0027t be coming here, would he? All those others must be his trusty band of good companions. After all, common sense, he\u0027s got to come five hundred miles across difficult country, anything could happen. I daresay the armour and swords is in the carts. She detected a twinge of doubt, and set out to quell it instantly. There isn\u0027t any other reason for him to come, stands to reason. We got the spell exactly right. Except for the ingredients. And most of the poetry. And it probably wasn\u0027t the right time. And Gytha took most of it home for the cat, which couldn\u0027t of been proper. But he\u0027s on his way. What can\u0027t speak, can\u0027t lie. \u0027Best put the cloth over it when you\u0027ve done, Esme,\u0027 said Nanny. \u0027I always get worried someone\u0027ll peer in at me when I\u0027m having my bath.\u0027 \u0027He\u0027s on his way,\u0027 said Granny, the satisfaction in her voice so strong you could have ground corn with it. She dropped the black velvet bag over the ball. \u0027It\u0027s a long road,\u0027 said Nanny. \u0027There\u0027s many a slip twixt dress and drawers. There could be bandits.\u0027 \u0027We shall watch over him,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027That\u0027s not right. If he\u0027s going to be king he ought to be able to fight his own battles,\u0027 said Magrat. \u0027We don\u0027t want him to go wasting his strength,\u0027 said Nanny primly. \u0027We want him good and fresh for when he gets here.\u0027 \u0027And then, I hope, we shall leave him to fight his battles in his own way,\u0027 said Magrat. Granny clapped her hands together in a businesslike fashion. \u0027Quite right,\u0027 she said. \u0027Provided he looks like winning.\u0027 They had been meeting at Nanny Ogg\u0027s cottage. Magrat made an excuse to tarry after Granny left, around dawn, allegedly to help Nanny with tidying up. \u0027Whatever happened to not meddling?\u0027 she said. \u0027What do you mean?\u0027 \u0027You know, Nanny.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s not proper meddling,\u0027 said Nanny awkwardly. \u0027Just helping matters along.\u0027 \u0027Surely you can\u0027t really think that!\u0027 Nanny sat down and fidgeted with a cushion. \u0027Well, see, all this not meddling business is fine in the normal course of things,\u0027 she said. \u0027Not meddling is easy when you don\u0027t have to. And then I\u0027ve got the family to think about. Our Jason\u0027s been in a couple of fights because of what people have been saying. Our Shawn was thrown out of the army. The way I see it, when we get the new king in, he should owe us a few favours. It\u0027s only fair.\u0027 \u0027But only last week you were saying—\u0027 Magrat stopped, shocked at this display of pragmatism. \u0027A week is a long time in magic,\u0027 said Nanny. \u0027Fifteen years, for one thing. Anyway, Esme is determined and I\u0027m in no mood to stop her.\u0027 \u0027So what you\u0027re saying,\u0027 said Magrat, icily, \u0027is that this “not meddling” thing is like taking a vow not to swim. You\u0027ll absolutely never break it unless of course you happen to find yourself in the water?\u0027 \u0027Better than drowning,\u0027 Nanny said. She reached up to the mantelpiece and took down a clay pipe that was like a small tar pit. She lit it with a spill from the remains of the fire, while Greebo watched her carefully from his cushion. Magrat idly lifted the hood from the ball and glared at it. \u0027I think,\u0027 she said, \u0027that I will never really understand about witchcraft. Just when I think I\u0027ve got a grip on it, it changes.\u0027 \u0027We\u0027re all just people.\u0027 Nanny blew a cloud of blue smoke at the chimney. \u0027Everyone\u0027s just people.\u0027 \u0027Can I borrow the crystal?\u0027 said Magrat suddenly. \u0027Feel free,\u0027 said Nanny. She grinned at Magrat\u0027s back. \u0027Had a row with your young man?\u0027 she said. \u0027I really don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about.\u0027 \u0027Haven\u0027t seen him around for weeks.\u0027 \u0027Oh, the duke sent him to—\u0027 Magrat stopped, and went on – \u0027sent him away for something or other. Not that it bothers me at all, either way.\u0027 \u0027So I see. Take the ball, by all means.\u0027 Magrat was glad to get back home. No-one was about on the moors at night anyway, but over the last couple of months things had definitely been getting worse. On top of the general suspicion of witches, it was dawning on the few people in Lancre who had any dealings with the outside world that a) either more things had been happening than they had heard about before or b) time was out of joint. It wasn\u0027t easy to prove[19], but the few traders who came along the mountain tracks after the winter seemed to be rather older than they should have been. Unexplained happenings were always more or less expected in the Ramtops because of the high magical potential, but several years disappearing overnight was a bit of a first. She locked the door, fastened the shutters, and carefully laid the green glass globe on the kitchen table. She concentrated . . . The Fool dozed under the tarpaulins of the river barge, heading up the Ankh at a steady two miles an hour. It wasn\u0027t an exciting method of transport but it got you there eventually. He looked safe enough, but he was tossing and turning in his sleep. Magrat wondered what it was like, spending your whole life doing something you didn\u0027t want to do. Like being dead, she considered, only worse, the reason being, you were alive to suffer it. She considered the Fool to be weak, badly led and sorely in need of some backbone. And she was longing for him to get back, so she could look forward to never seeing him again. It was a long, hot summer. They didn\u0027t rush things. There was a lot of country between Ankh-Morpork and the Ramtops. It was, Hwel had to admit, fun. It wasn\u0027t a word dwarfs were generally at home with. Please Yourself went over well. It always did. The apprentices excelled themselves. They forgot lines, and played jokes; in Sto Lat the whole third act of Gretalina and Mellias was performed against the backdrop for the second act of The Mage Wars, but no-one seemed to notice that the greatest love scene in history was played on a set depicting a tidal wave sweeping across a continent. That was possibly because Tomjon was playing Gretalina. The effect was so disconcertingly riveting that Hwel made him swap roles for the next house, if you could apply the term to a barn hired for the day, and the effect still had more rivets than a suit of plate armour, including the helmet, and even though Gretalina in this case was now young Wimsloe, who was a bit simple and tended to stutter and whose spots might eventually clear up. The following day, in some nameless village in the middle of an endless sea of cabbages, he let Tomjon play Old Miskin in Please Yourself, a role that Vitoller always excelled in. You couldn\u0027t let anyone play it who was under the age of forty, not unless you wanted an Old Miskin with a cushion up his jerkin and greasepaint wrinkles. Hwel didn\u0027t consider himself old. His father had still been digging three tons of ore a day at the age of two hundred. Now he felt old. He watched Tomjon hobble off the stage, and for a fleeting instant knew what it was to be a fat old man, pickled in wine, fighting old wars that no-one cared about any more, hanging grimly on to the precipice of late middle-age for fear of dropping off into antiquity, but only with one hand, because with the other he was raising two fingers at Death. Of course, he\u0027d known that when he wrote the part. But he hadn\u0027t known it.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wyrd-sisters-discworld-6/page-31.html","bookId":1625,"book":{"id":1625,"title":"Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6)","description":"Storyline: Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6) Witches are not by nature gregarious, and they certainly don\u0027t have leaders.
