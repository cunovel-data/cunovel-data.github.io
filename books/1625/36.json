{"id":95600,"no":36,"title":"Page 36","content":"Tomjon sipped his tea uneasily, the backstage noises whirring around him like so much fog. He was worried.\n Hwel had said that everything about the play was fine, except for the play itself. And Tomjon kept thinking that the play itself was trying to force itself into a different shape. His mind had been hearing other words, just too faint for hearing. It was almost like eavesdropping on a conversation. He\u0027d had to shout more to drown out the buzzing in his head.\n This wasn\u0027t right. Once a play was written it was, well, written. It shouldn\u0027t come alive and start twisting itself around.\n No wonder everyone needed prompting all the time. The play was writhing under their hands, trying to change itself.\n Ye gods, he\u0027d be glad to get out of this spooky castle, and away from this mad duke. He glanced around, decided that it would be some time before the next act was called, and wandered aimlessly in search of fresher air.\n A door yielded to his touch and he stepped out on to the battlements. He pushed it shut behind him, cutting off the sounds of the stage and replacing them by a velvet hush. There was a livid sunset imprisoned behind bars of cloud, but the air was as still as a mill pond and as hot as a furnace. In the forest below some night bird screamed.\n He walked to the other end of the battlements and peered down into the sheer depths of the gorge. Far beneath, the Lancre boiled in its eternal mists.\n He turned, and walked into a draught of such icy coldness that he gasped.\n Unusual breezes plucked at his clothing. There was a strange muttering in his ear, as though someone was-trying to talk to him but couldn\u0027t get the speed right. He stood rigid for a moment, getting his breath, and then fled for the door.\n \u0027But we\u0027re not witches!\u0027\n \u0027Why do you look like them, then? Tie their hands, lads.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, excuse me, but we\u0027re not really witches!\u0027\n The captain of the guard looked from face to face. His gaze took in the pointy hats, the disordered hair smelling of damp haystacks, the sickly green complexions and the herd of warts. Guard captain for the duke wasn\u0027t a job that offered long-term prospects for those who used initiative. Three witches had been called for, and these seemed to fit the bill.\n The captain never went to the theatre. When he was on the rack of adolescence he\u0027d been badly frightened by a Punch and Judy show, and since then had taken pains to avoid any organised entertainment and had kept away from anywhere where crocodiles could conceivably be expected. He\u0027d spent the last hour enjoying a quiet drink in the guardroom.\n \u0027I said tie their hands, didn\u0027t I?\u0027 he snapped.\n \u0027Shall we gag them as well, cap\u0027n?\u0027\n \u0027But if you\u0027d just listen, we\u0027re with the theatre—\u0027\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said the captain, shuddering. \u0027Gag them.\u0027\n \u0027Please . . .\u0027\n The captain leaned down and stared at three pairs of frightened eyes. He was trembling.\n \u0027That,\u0027 he said, \u0027is the last time you\u0027ll eat anyone\u0027s sausage.\u0027\n He was aware that now the soldiers were giving him odd looks as well. He coughed and pulled himself together.\n \u0027Very well then, my theatrical witches,\u0027 he said. \u0027You\u0027ve done your show, and now it\u0027s time for your applause.\u0027 He nodded to his men.\n \u0027Clap them in chains,\u0027 he said.\n Three other witches sat in the gloom behind the stage, staring vacantly into the darkness. Granny Weatherwax had picked up a copy of the script, which she peered at from time to time, as if seeking ideas.\n \u0027 “Divers alarums and excursions”,\u0027 she read, uncertainly.\n \u0027That means lots of terrible happenings,\u0027 said Magrat. \u0027You always put that in plays.\u0027\n \u0027Alarums and what?\u0027 said Nanny Ogg, who hadn\u0027t been listening.\n \u0027Excursions,\u0027 said Magrat patiently.\n \u0027Oh.\u0027 Nanny Ogg brightened a bit. \u0027The seaside would be nice,\u0027 she said.\n \u0027Do shut up, Gytha,\u0027 said Granny Weatherwax. \u0027They\u0027re not for you. They\u0027re only for divers, like it says. Probably so they can recover from all them alarums.\u0027\n \u0027We can\u0027t let this happen,\u0027 said Magrat, quickly and loudly. \u0027If this gets about, witches\u0027ll always be old hags with green blusher.\u0027\n \u0027And meddlin\u0027 in the affairs of kings,\u0027 said Nanny. \u0027Which we never do, as is well known.\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s not the meddlin\u0027 I object to,\u0027 said Granny Weatherwax, her chin on her hand. \u0027It\u0027s the evil meddling.\u0027\n \u0027And the unkindness to animals,\u0027 muttered Magrat. \u0027All that stuff about eye of dog and ear of toad. No-one uses that kind of stuff.\u0027\n Granny Weatherwax and Nanny Ogg carefully avoided one another\u0027s faces.\n \u0027Drabe!\u0027 said Nanny Ogg bitterly.\n \u0027Witches just aren\u0027t like that,\u0027 said Magrat. \u0027We live in harmony with the great cycles of Nature, and do no harm to anyone, and it\u0027s wicked of them to say we don\u0027t. We ought to fill their bones with hot lead.\u0027\n The other two looked at her with a certain amount of surprised admiration. She blushed, although not greenly, and looked at her knees.\n \u0027Goodie Whemper did a recipe,\u0027 she confessed. \u0027It\u0027s quite easy. What you do is, you get some lead, and you—\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t think that would be appropriate,\u0027 said Granny carefully, after a certain amount of internal struggle. \u0027It could give people the wrong idea.\u0027\n \u0027But not for long,\u0027 said Nanny wistfully.\n \u0027No, we can\u0027t be having with that sort of thing,\u0027 said Granny, a little more firmly this time. \u0027We\u0027d never hear the last of it.\u0027\n \u0027Why don\u0027t we just change the words?\u0027 said Magrat. \u0027When they come back on stage we could just put the \u0027fluence on them so they forget what they\u0027re saying, and give them some new words.\u0027\n \u0027I suppose you\u0027re an expert at theatre words?\u0027 said Granny sarcastically. \u0027They\u0027d have to be the proper sort, otherwise people would suspect.\u0027\n \u0027Shouldn\u0027t be too difficult,\u0027 said Nanny Ogg dismissively. \u0027I\u0027ve been studyin\u0027 it. You go tumpty-tumpty-tumpty.\u0027\n Granny gave this some consideration.\n \u0027There\u0027s more to it than that, I believe,\u0027 she said. \u0027Some of those speeches were very good. I couldn\u0027t understand hardly any of it.\u0027\n \u0027There\u0027s no trick to it at all,\u0027 Nanny Ogg insisted. \u0027Anyway, half of them are forgetting their lines as it is. It\u0027ll be easy.\u0027\n \u0027We could put words in their mouths?\u0027 said Magrat.\n Nanny Ogg nodded. \u0027I don\u0027t know about new words,\u0027 she said. \u0027But we can make them forget these words.\u0027\n They both looked at Granny Weatherwax. She shrugged.\n \u0027I suppose it\u0027s worth a try,\u0027 she conceded.\n \u0027Witches as yet unborn will thank us for it,\u0027 said Magrat ardently.\n \u0027Oh, good,\u0027 said Granny.\n \u0027At last! What are you three playing at? We\u0027ve been looking for you everywhere!\u0027\n The witches turned to see an irate dwarf trying to loom over them.\n \u0027Us?\u0027 said Magrat. \u0027But we\u0027re not in—\u0027\n \u0027Oh yes you are, remember, we put it in last week. Act Two, Downstage, around the cauldron. You haven\u0027t got to say anything. You\u0027re symbolising occult forces at work. Just be as wicked as you can. Come on, there\u0027s good lads. You\u0027ve done well so far.\u0027\n Hwel slapped Magrat on the bottom. \u0027Good complexion you\u0027ve got mere, Wilph,\u0027 he said encouragingly. \u0027But for goodness\u0027 sake use a bit more padding, you\u0027re still the wrong shape. Fine warts there, Billem. I must say,\u0027 he added, standing back, \u0027you look as nasty a bunch of hags as a body might hope to clap eyes on. Well done. Shame about the wigs. Now run along. Curtain up in one minute. Break a leg.\u0027\n He gave Magrat another ringing slap on her rump, slightly hurting his hand, and hurried off to shout at someone else.\n None of the witches dared to speak. Magrat and Nanny Ogg found themselves instinctively turning towards Granny.\n She sniffed. She looked up. She looked around. She looked at the brightly lit stage behind her. She brought her hands together with a clap that echoed around the castle, and then rubbed them together.\n \u0027Useful,\u0027 she said grimly. \u0027Let\u0027s do the show right here.\u0027 Nanny squinted sullenly after Hwel. \u0027Break your own leg,\u0027 she muttered.\n Hwel stood in the wings and gave the signal for the curtains. And for the thunder.\n It didn\u0027t come.\n \u0027Thunder!\u0027 he hissed, in a voice heard by half the audience. \u0027Get on with it!\u0027\n A voice from behind the nearest pillar wailed, \u0027I went and bent the thunder, Hwel! It just goes clonk-clonk!\u0027\n Hwel stood silent for a moment, counting. The company watched him, awestruck but not, unfortunately, thunderstruck.\n At last he raised his fists to the open sky and said, \u0027I wanted a storm! Just a storm. Not even a big storm. Any storm. Now I want to make myself absolutely CLEAR! I have had ENOUGH! I want thunder right NOW!\u0027\n The stab of lightning that answered him turned the multi-hued shadows of the castle into blinding white and searing black. It was followed by a roll of thunder, on cue.\n It was the loudest noise Hwel had ever heard. It seemed to start inside his head and work its way outwards.\n It went on and on, shaking every stone in the castle. Dust rained down. A distant turret broke away with balletic slowness and, tumbling end over end, dropped gently into the hungry depths of the gorge.\n When it finished it left a silence that rang like a bell.\n Hwel looked up at the sky. Great black clouds were blowing across the castle, blotting out the stars.\n The storm was back.\n It had spent ages learning its craft. It had spent years lurking in distant valleys. It had practised for hours in front of a glacier. It had studied the great storms of the past. It had honed its art to perfection. And now, tonight, with what it could see was clearly an appreciative audience waiting for it, it was going to take them by, well . . . tempest.\n Hwel smiled. Perhaps the gods did listen, after all. He wished he\u0027d asked for a really good wind machine as well.\n He gestured frantically at Tomjon.\n \u0027Get on with it!\u0027\n The boy nodded, and launched into his main speech.\n \u0027And now our domination is complete—\u0027\n Behind him on the stage the witches bent over the cauldron.\n \u0027It\u0027s just tin, this one,\u0027 hissed Nanny. \u0027And it\u0027s full of all yuk.\u0027\n \u0027And the fire is just red paper,\u0027 whispered Magrat. \u0027It looked so real from up there, it\u0027s just red paper! Look, you can poke it—\u0027\n \u0027Never mind,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027Just look busy, and wait until I say.\u0027\n As the Evil King and the Good Duke began the exchange that was going to lead to the exciting Duel Scene they became uncomfortably aware of activity behind them, and occasional chuckles from the audience. After a totally inappropriate burst of laughter Tomjon risked a sideways glance.\n One of the witches was taking their fire to bits. Another one was trying to clean the cauldron. The third one was sitting with her arms folded, glaring at him.\n \u0027The very soil cries out at tyranny—\u0027 said Wimsloe, and then caught the expression on Tomjon\u0027s face and followed his gaze. His voice trailed into silence.\n \u0027 “And calls me forth for vengeance”,\u0027 prompted Tomjon helpfully.\n \u0027B-but—\u0027 whispered Wimsloe, trying to point surreptitiously with his dagger.\n \u0027I wouldn\u0027t be seen dead with a cauldron like this,\u0027 said Nanny Ogg, in a whisper loud enough to carry to the back of the courtyard. \u0027Two days\u0027 work with a scourer and a bucket of sand, is this.\u0027\n \u0027 “And calls me forth for vengeance” \u0027 hissed Tomjon. Out of the tail of his eye he saw Hwel in the wings, frozen in an attitude of incoherent rage.\n \u0027How do they make it flicker?\u0027 said Magrat.\n \u0027Be quiet, you two,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027You\u0027re upsetting people.\u0027 She raised her hat to Wimsloe. \u0027Go ahead, young man. Don\u0027t mind us.\u0027\n \u0027Wha?\u0027 said Wimsloe.\n \u0027Aha, it calls you forth for vengeance, does it?\u0027 said Tomjon. in desperation. \u0027And the heavens cry revenge, too, I expect.\u0027\n On cue, the storm produced a thunderbolt that blew the top off another tower . . . \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wyrd-sisters-discworld-6/page-36.html","bookId":1625,"book":{"id":1625,"title":"Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6)","description":"Storyline: \n Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6) \n Witches are not by nature gregarious, and they certainly don\u0027t have leaders.
