{"id":95594,"no":29,"title":"Page 29","content":"Tomjon joined him at the window, and pointed down the length of the street.\n \u0027See all those tavern signs?\u0027 he said.\n \u0027Yes. Gosh. There\u0027s hundreds.\u0027\n \u0027Right. See the one at the end, with the blue and white sign?\u0027\n \u0027Yes. I think so.\u0027\n \u0027Well, as far as I know, that\u0027s the only one around here that\u0027s ever closed.\u0027\n \u0027Then pray allow me to treat you to a drink. It\u0027s the least I can do,\u0027 said the Fool nervously. \u0027And I\u0027m sure the little fellow would like something to quaff.\u0027\n Hwel gripped the edge of the table and opened his mouth to roar.\n And stopped.\n He stared at the two figures. His mouth stayed open.\n It closed again with a snap.\n \u0027Something the matter?\u0027 said Tomjon.\n Hwel looked away. It had been a long night. \u0027Trick of the light,\u0027 he muttered. \u0027And I could do with a drink,\u0027 he added. \u0027A bloody good quaff.\u0027\n In fact, he thought, why fight it? \u0027I\u0027ll even put up with the singing,\u0027 he said.\n \u0027Was\u0027 the nex\u0027 wor\u0027?\u0027\n \u0027S\u0027gold. I think.\u0027\n \u0027Ah.\u0027\n Hwel looked unsteadily into his mug. Drunkenness had this to be said for it, it stopped the flow of inspirations.\n \u0027And you left out the “gold”,\u0027 he said.\n \u0027Where?\u0027 said Tomjon. He was wearing the Fool\u0027s hat.\n Hwel considered this. \u0027I reckon,\u0027 he said, concentrating, \u0027it was between the “gold” and the “gold”. An\u0027 I reckon,\u0027 he peered again into the mug. It was. empty, a horrifying sight. \u0027I reckon,\u0027 he tried again, and finally gave up, and substituted, \u0027I reckon I could do with another drink.\u0027\n \u0027My shout this time,\u0027 said the Fool. \u0027Hahaha. My squeak. Hahaha.\u0027 He tried to stand up, and banged his head.\n In the gloom of the bar a dozen axes were gripped more firmly. The part of Hwel that was sober, and was horrified to see the rest of him being drunk, urged him to wave his hand at the beetling brows glaring at them through the gloom.\n \u0027S\u0027all right,\u0027 he said, to the bar at large. \u0027He don\u0027t mean it, he ver\u0027 funny wossname, idiot. Fool. Ver\u0027 funny Fool, all way from wassisplace.\u0027\n \u0027Lancre,\u0027 said the Fool, and sat down heavily on the bar.\n \u0027S\u0027right. Long way away from wossname, sounds like foot disease. Don\u0027t know how to behave. Don\u0027t know many dwarfs.\u0027\n \u0027Hahaha,\u0027 said the Fool, clutching his head. \u0027Bit short of them where I come from.\u0027\n Someone tapped Hwel on the shoulder. He turned and looked into a craggy, hairy face under an iron helmet. The dwarf in question was tossing a throwing axe up and down in a meaningful way.\n \u0027You ought to tell your friend to be a bit less funny,\u0027 he suggested. \u0027Otherwise he will be amusing the demons in Hell!\u0027\n Hwel squinted at him through the alcoholic haze.\n \u0027Who\u0027re you?\u0027 he said.\n \u0027Grabpot Thundergust,\u0027 said the dwarf, striking his chain-mailed torso. \u0027And I say—\u0027\n Hwel peered closer.\n \u0027Here, I know you,\u0027 he said. \u0027You got a cosmetics mill down Hobfast Street. I bought a lot of greasepaint off you last week—\u0027\n A look of panic crossed Thundergust\u0027s face. He leaned forward in panic. \u0027Shutup, shutup,\u0027 he whispered.\n \u0027That\u0027s right, it said the Halls of Elven Perfume and Rouge Co.,\u0027 said Hwel happily.\n \u0027Ver\u0027 good stuff,\u0027 said Tomjon, who was trying to stop himself from sliding off the tiny bench. \u0027Especially your No. 19, Corpse Green, my father swears it\u0027s the best. First class.\u0027\n The dwarf hefted-his axe uneasily. \u0027Well, er,\u0027 he said. \u0027Oh. But. Yes. Well, thank you. Only the finest ingredients, mark you.\u0027\n \u0027Chop them up with that, do you?\u0027 said Hwel innocently, pointing to the axe. \u0027Or is it your night off?\u0027\n Thundergust\u0027s brows beetled again like a cockroach convention.\n \u0027Here, you\u0027re not with the theatre?\u0027\n \u0027Tha\u0027s us,\u0027 said Tomjon. \u0027Strolling players.\u0027 He corrected himself. \u0027Standing-still players now. Haha. Slidin\u0027-down players now.\u0027\n The dwarf dropped his axe and sat down on the bench, his face suddenly softened with enthusiasm.\n \u0027I went last week,\u0027 he said. \u0027Bloody good, it was. There was this girl and this fellow, but she was married to this old man, and there was this other fellow, and they said he\u0027d died, and she pined away and took poison, but then it turned out this man was the other man really, only he couldn\u0027t tell her on account of—\u0027 Thundergust stopped, and blew his nose. \u0027Everyone died in the end,\u0027 he said. \u0027Very tragic. I cried all the way home, I don\u0027t mind telling you. She was so pale.\u0027\n \u0027No. 19 and a layer of powder,\u0027 said Tomjon cheerfully. \u0027Plus a bit of brown eyeshadow.\u0027\n \u0027Eh?\u0027\n \u0027And a couple of hankies in the vest,\u0027 he added.\n \u0027What\u0027s he saying?\u0027 said the dwarf to the company at, for want of a better word, large.\n Hwel smiled into his tankard.\n \u0027Give \u0027em a bit of Gretalina\u0027s soliloquy, boy,\u0027 he said.\n \u0027Right.\u0027\n Tomjon stood up, hit his head, sat down and then knelt on the floor as a compromise. He clasped his hands to what would have been, but for a few chance chromosomes, his bosom.\n \u0027You lie who call it Summer . . .\u0027 he began.\n The assembled dwarfs listened in silence for several minutes. One of them dropped his axe, and was noisily hushed by the rest of them.\n \u0027. . . and melting snow. Farewell,\u0027 Tomjon finished. \u0027Drinks phial, collapses behind battlements, down ladder, out of dress and into tabard for Comic Guard No.2, wait one, entrance left. What ho, good—\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s about enough,\u0027 said Hwel quietly.\n Several of the dwarfs were crying into their helmets. There was a chorus of blown noses.\n Thundergust dabbed at his eyes with a chain-mail handkerchief.\n \u0027That was the most saddest thing I\u0027ve ever heard,\u0027 he said. He glared at Tomjon. \u0027Hang on,\u0027 he said, as realisation dawned. \u0027He\u0027s a man. I bloody fell in love with that girl on stage.\u0027 He nudged Hwel. \u0027He\u0027s not a bit of an elf, is he?\u0027\n \u0027Absolutely human,\u0027 said Hwel. \u0027I know his father.\u0027\n Once again he stared hard at the Fool, who was watching them with his mouth open, and looked back at Tomjon.\n Nah, he thought. Coincidence.\n \u0027S\u0027acting,\u0027 he said. \u0027A good actor can be anything, right?\u0027\n He could feel the Fool\u0027s eye boring into the back of his short neck.\n \u0027Yes, but dressing up as women, it\u0027s a bit—\u0027 said Thundergust doubtfully.\n Tomjon slipped off his shoes and knelt down on them, bringing his face level with the dwarfs. He gave him a calculating stare for a few seconds, and then adjusted his features.\n And there were two Thundergusts. True, one of them was kneeling and had apparently been shaved.\n \u0027What ho, what ho,\u0027 said Tomjon in the dwarf\u0027s voice.\n This was by way of being a hilarious gag to the rest of the dwarfs, who had an uncomplicated sense of humour. As they gathered round the pair Hwel felt a gentle touch on the shoulder.\n \u0027You two are with a theatre?\u0027 said the Fool, now almost sober.\n \u0027S\u0027right.\u0027\n \u0027Then I\u0027ve come five hundred miles to find you.\u0027\n It was, as Hwel would have noted in his stage directions, Later the Same Day. The sounds of hammering as the Dysk theatre rose from its cradle of scaffolding thumped through Hwel\u0027s head and out the other side.\n He could remember the drinking, he was certain. And the dwarfs bought lots more rounds when Tomjon did his impersonations. Then they had all gone to another bar Thundergust knew, and then they\u0027d gone to a Klatchian takeaway, and after that it was just a blur . . .\n He wasn\u0027t very good at quaffing. Too much of the drink actually landed in his mouth.\n Judging by the taste in it, some incontinent creature of the night had also scored a direct hit.\n \u0027Can you do it?\u0027 said Vitoller.\n Hwel smacked his lips to get rid of the taste.\n \u0027I expect,\u0027 said Tomjon. \u0027It sounded interesting, the way he told it. Wicked king ruling with the help of evil witches. Storms. Ghastly forests. True Heir to Throne in Life-and-Death Struggle. Flash of Dagger. Screams, alarums. Evil king dies. Good triumphs. Bells ring out.\u0027\n \u0027Showers of rose petals could be arranged,\u0027 said Vitoller. \u0027I know a man who can get them at practically cost.\u0027\n They both looked at Hwel, who was drumming his fingers on his stool. All three found their attention drawn to the bag of silver the Fool had given Hwel. Even by itself it represented enough money to complete the Dysk. And there had been talk of more to follow. Patronage, that was the thing.\n \u0027You\u0027ll do it then, will you?\u0027 said Vitoller.\n \u0027It\u0027s got a certain something,\u0027 Hwel conceded. \u0027But . . . I don\u0027t know . . .\u0027\n Tm not trying to pressure you,\u0027 said Vitoller. All three pairs of eyes swivelled back to the money bag.\n \u0027It seems a bit fishy,\u0027 Tomjon conceded. \u0027I mean, the Fool is decent enough. But the way he tells it . . . it\u0027s very odd. His mouth says the words, and his eyes say something else. And I got the impression he\u0027d much rather we believed his eyes.\u0027\n \u0027On the other hand,\u0027 said Vitoller hurriedly, \u0027what harm could it do? The pay\u0027s the thing.\u0027\n Hwel raised his head.\n \u0027What?\u0027 he said muzzily.\n \u0027I said, the play\u0027s the thing,\u0027 said Vitoller.\n There was silence again, except for the drumming of Hwel\u0027s fingertips. The bag of silver seemed to have grown larger. In fact, it seemed to fill the room.\n \u0027The thing is—\u0027 Vitoller began, unnecessarily loudly.\n \u0027The way I see it—\u0027 Hwel began.\n They both stopped.\n \u0027After you. Sorry.\u0027\n \u0027It wasn\u0027t important. Go ahead.\u0027\n \u0027I was going to say, we could afford to build the Dysk anyway,\u0027 said Hwel.\n \u0027Just the shell and the stage,\u0027 said Vitoller. \u0027But not all the other things. Not the trapdoor mechanism, or the machine for lowering gods out of heaven. Or the big turntable, or the wind fans.\u0027\n \u0027We used to manage without all that stuff,\u0027 said Hwel. \u0027Remember the old days? All we had was a few planks and a bit of painted sacking. But we had a lot of spirit. If we wanted wind we had to make it ourselves.\u0027 He drummed his fingers for a while. \u0027Of course,\u0027 he added quietly, \u0027we should be able to afford a wave machine. A small one. I\u0027ve got this idea about this ship wrecked on an island, where there\u0027s this—\u0027\n \u0027Sorry.\u0027 Vitoller shook his head. \u0027\n \u0027But we\u0027ve had some huge audiences!\u0027 said Tomjon.\n \u0027Sure, lad. Sure. But they pay in ha\u0027pennies. The artificers want silver. If we wanted to be rich men – people,\u0027 he corrected hurriedly, \u0027we should have been born carpenters.\u0027 Vitoller shifted uneasily. \u0027I already owe Chrystophrase the Troll more than I should.\u0027\n The other two stared.\n \u0027He\u0027s the one that has people\u0027s limbs torn off!\u0027 said Tomjon.\n \u0027How much do you owe him?\u0027 said Hwel.\n \u0027It\u0027s all right,\u0027 said Vitoller hurriedly, Tm keeping up the interest payments. More or less.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, but how much does he want?\u0027\n \u0027An arm and a leg.\u0027\n The dwarf and boy stared at him in horror. \u0027How could you have been so—\u0027\n \u0027I did it for you two! Tomjon deserves a better stage, he doesn\u0027t want to go ruining his health sleeping in lattys and never knowing a home, and you, my man, you need somewhere settled, with all the proper things you ought to have, like trapdoors and . . . wave machines and so forth. You talked me into it, and I thought, they\u0027re right. It\u0027s no life out on the road, giving two performances a day to a bunch of farmers and going round with a hat afterwards, what sort of future is that? I thought, we\u0027ve got to get a place somewhere, with comfortable seats for the gentry, people who don\u0027t throw potatoes at the stage. I said, blow the cost. I just wanted you to—\u0027\n \u0027All right, all right!\u0027 shouted Hwel. \u0027I\u0027ll write it!\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ll act it,\u0027 said Tomjon.\n \u0027I\u0027m not forcing you, mind,\u0027 said Vitoller. \u0027It\u0027s your own choice.\u0027\n Hwel frowned at the table. There were, he had to admit, some nice touches. Three witches was good. Two wouldn\u0027t be enough, four would be too many. They could be meddling with the destinies of mankind, and everything. Lots of smoke and green light. You could do a lot with three witches. It was surprising no-one had thought of it before. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wyrd-sisters-discworld-6/page-29.html","bookId":1625,"book":{"id":1625,"title":"Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6)","description":"Storyline: \n Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6) \n Witches are not by nature gregarious, and they certainly don\u0027t have leaders.
