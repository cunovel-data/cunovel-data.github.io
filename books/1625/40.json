{"id":95604,"no":40,"title":"Page 40","content":"The castle up above was full of hubbub and general rejoicing, and there was no-one to hear the polite and frantic voices that echoed along the dungeon passages, getting politer and more frantic with each passing hour. \u0027Um, I say? Excuse me? Billem\u0027s got this terrible thing about rats, if you don\u0027t mind. Cooeee!\u0027 Let the camera of the mind\u0027s eye pan slowly back along the dim, ancient corridors, taking in the dripping fungi, the rusting ehains, the damp, the shadows . . . \u0027Can anyone hear us? Look, it\u0027s really too much. There\u0027s been some laughable mistake, look, the wigs come right off. . .\u0027 Let the plaintive echoes dwindle among the cobwebbed corners and rodent-haunted tunnels, until they\u0027re no more than a reedy whisper on the cusp of hearing. \u0027I say? I say, excuse me, help?\u0027 Someone is bound to come down here again one of these days. Some time afterwards Magrat asked Hwel if he believed in long engagements. The dwarf paused in the task of loading up the latty.[22] \u0027About a week, maximum,\u0027 he said at last. \u0027With matinees, of course.\u0027 A month went past. The early damp-earth odours of autumn drifted over the velvety-dark moors, where the watery starlight was echoed by one spark of a fire. The standing stone was back in its normal place, but still poised to run if any auditors came into view. The witches sat in careful silence. This was not going to rate among the hundred most exciting coven meetings of all time. If Mussorgsky had seen them, the night on the bare mountain would have been over by teatime. Then Granny Weatherwax said, \u0027It was a good banquet, I thought.\u0027 \u0027I was nearly sick,\u0027 said Nanny Ogg proudly. \u0027And my Shirl helped out in the kitchen and brought me home some scraps.\u0027 \u0027I heard,\u0027 said Granny coldly. \u0027Haifa pig and three bottles of fizzy wine went missing, they say.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s nice that some people think of the old folk,\u0027 said Nanny Ogg, completely unabashed. \u0027I got a coronation mug, too.\u0027 She produced it. \u0027It says “Viva Verence II Rex”. Fancy him being called Rex. I can\u0027t say it\u0027s a good likeness, mind you. I don\u0027t recall him having a handle sticking out of his ear.\u0027 There was another long, terribly polite pause. Then Granny said, \u0027We were a bit surprised you weren\u0027t there, Magrat.\u0027 \u0027We thought you\u0027d be up at the top of the table, kind of thing,\u0027 said Nanny. \u0027We thought you\u0027d have moved in up there.\u0027 Magrat stared fixedly at her feet. \u0027I wasn\u0027t invited,\u0027 she said meekly. \u0027Well, I don\u0027t know about invited,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027We weren\u0027t invited. People don\u0027t have to invite witches, they just know we\u0027ll turn up if we want to. They soon find room for us,\u0027 she added, with some satisfaction. \u0027You see, he\u0027s been very busy,\u0027 said Magrat to her feet. \u0027Sorting everything out, you know. He\u0027s very clever, you know. Underneath.\u0027 \u0027Very sober lad,\u0027 said Nanny. \u0027Anyway, it\u0027s full moon,\u0027 said Magrat quickly. \u0027You\u0027ve got to go to coven meetings at full moon, no matter what other pressing engagements there may be.\u0027 \u0027Have y—?\u0027 Nanny Ogg began, but Granny nudged her sharply in the ribs. \u0027It\u0027s a very good thing he\u0027s paying so much attention to getting the kingdom working again,\u0027 said Granny, soothingly. \u0027It shows proper consideration. I daresay he\u0027ll get around to everything, sooner or later. It\u0027s very demanding, being a king.\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Magrat, her voice barely audible. The silence that followed was almost solid. It was broken by Nanny, in a voice as bright and brittle as ice. \u0027Well, I brought a bottle of that fizzy wine with me,\u0027 she said. \u0027In case he\u0027d . . . in case . . . in case we felt like a drink,\u0027 she rallied, and waved it at the other two. \u0027I don\u0027t want any,\u0027 said Magrat sullenly. \u0027You drink up, girl,\u0027 said Granny Weatherwax. \u0027It\u0027s a chilly night. It\u0027d be good for your chest.\u0027 She squinted at Magrat as the moon drifted out from behind its cloud. \u0027Here,\u0027 she said. \u0027Your hair looks a bit grubby. It looks as though you haven\u0027t washed it for a month.\u0027 Magrat burst into tears. The same moon shone down on the otherwise unremarkable town of Rham Nitz, some ninety miles from Lancre. Tomjon left the stage to thunderous applause at the concluding act of The Troll ofAnkh. A hundred people would go home tonight wondering whether trolls were really as bad as they had hitherto thought although, of course, this wouldn\u0027t actually stop them disliking them in any way whatsoever. Hwel patted him on the back as he sat down at the makeup table and started scraping off the thick grey sludge that was intended to make him look like a walking rock. \u0027Well done,\u0027 he said. \u0027The love scene – just right. And when you turned around and roared at the wizard I shouldn\u0027t think there was a dry seat in the house.\u0027 \u0027I know.\u0027 Hwel rubbed his hands together. \u0027We can afford a tavern tonight,\u0027 he said. \u0027So if we just—\u0027 \u0027We\u0027ll sleep in the carts,\u0027 said Tomjon firmly, squinting at himself in the shard of mirror. \u0027But you know how much the Fo – the king gave us! It could be feather beds all the way home!\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s straw mattresses and a good profit for us,\u0027 said Tomjon. \u0027And that\u0027ll buy you gods from heaven and demons from hell and the wind and the waves and more trapdoors than you can count, my lawn ornament.\u0027 Hwel\u0027s hand rested on Tomjon\u0027s shoulder for a moment. Then he said, \u0027You\u0027re right, boss.\u0027 \u0027Certainly I am. How\u0027s the play going?\u0027 \u0027Hmm? What play?\u0027 said Hwel, innocently. Tomjon carefully removed a plaster brow ridge. \u0027You know,\u0027 he said. \u0027That one. The Lancre King.\u0027 \u0027Oh. Coming along. Coming along, you know. I\u0027ll get it right one of these days.\u0027 Hwel changed the subject with speed. \u0027You know, we could work our way down to the river and take a boat home. That would be nice, wouldn\u0027t it?\u0027 \u0027But we could work our way home over land and pick up some more cash. That would be better, wouldn\u0027t it?\u0027 Tomjon grinned. \u0027We took one hundred and three pence tonight; I counted heads during the Judgement speech. That\u0027s nearly one silver piece after expenses.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re your father\u0027s son, and no mistake,\u0027 said Hwel. Tomjon sat back and looked at himself in the mirror. \u0027Yes,\u0027 he said, \u0027I thought I had better be.\u0027 Magrat didn\u0027t like cats and hated the idea of mousetraps. She\u0027d always felt that it should be possible to come to some sort of arrangement with creatures like mice so that all available food was rationed in the best interest of all parties. This was a very humanitarian outlook, which is to say that it was not a view shared by mice, and therefore her moonlit kitchen was alive. When there was a knocking at the door the entire floor appeared to rush towards the walls. After a few seconds the knocking came again. There was another pause. Then the knocking rattled the door on its hinges, and a voice cried, \u0027Open in the name of the king!\u0027 A second voice said, in hurt tones, \u0027You don\u0027t have to shout like that. Why did you shout like that? I didn\u0027t order you to shout like that. It\u0027s enough to frighten anybody, shouting like that.\u0027 \u0027Sorry, sire! It goes with the job, sire!\u0027 \u0027Just knock again. A bit more gently, please.\u0027 The knocking might have been a bit softer. Magrat\u0027s apron dropped off its hook on the back of the door. \u0027Are you sure I can\u0027t do it myself?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s not done, sire, kings knocking at humble cottage doors. Best leave it to me. OPEN IN THE—\u0027 \u0027Sergeant!\u0027 \u0027Sorry, sire. Forgot myself.\u0027 \u0027Try the latch.\u0027 There was the sound of someone being extremely hesitant. \u0027Don\u0027t like the sound of that, sire,\u0027 said the invisible sergeant. \u0027Could be dangerous. If you want my advice, sire, I\u0027d set fire to the thatch.\u0027 \u0027Set fire?\u0027 \u0027Yessire. We always do that if they don\u0027t answer the door. Brings them out a treat.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t think that would be appropriate, sergeant. I think I\u0027ll try the latch, if it\u0027s all the same to you.\u0027 \u0027Breaks my heart to see you do it, sire.\u0027 \u0027Well, I\u0027m sorry.\u0027 \u0027You could at least let me buff it up for you.\u0027 \u0027No!\u0027 \u0027Well, couldn\u0027t I just set fire to the privy—?\u0027 \u0027Absolutely not!\u0027 \u0027That chicken house over there looks as if it would go up like-\u0027 \u0027Sergeant!\u0027 \u0027Sire!\u0027 \u0027Go back to the castle!\u0027 \u0027What, and leave you all alone, sire?\u0027 \u0027This is a matter of extreme delicacy, sergeant. I am sure you are a man of sterling qualities, but there are times when even a king needs to be alone. It concerns a young woman, you understand.\u0027 \u0027Ah. Point taken, sire,\u0027 \u0027Thank you. Help me dismount, please.\u0027 \u0027Sorry about all that, sire. Tactless of me.\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t mention it.\u0027 \u0027If you need any help getting her alight—\u0027 \u0027Please go back to the castle, sergeant.\u0027 \u0027Yes, sire. If you\u0027re sure, sire. Thank you, sire.\u0027 \u0027Sergeant?\u0027 \u0027Yes, sire?\u0027 \u0027I shall need someone to take my cap and bells back to the Fools\u0027 Guild in Ankh-Morpork now I\u0027m leaving. It seems to me you\u0027re the ideal man.\u0027 \u0027Thank you, sire. Much obliged.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s your, ah, burning desire to be of service.\u0027 \u0027Yes, sire?\u0027 \u0027Make sure they put you up in one of the guest rooms.\u0027 \u0027Yes, sire. Thank you, sire.\u0027 There was the sound of a horse trotting away. A few seconds later the latch clonked and the Fool crept in. It takes considerable courage to enter a witch\u0027s kitchen in the dark, but probably no more than it takes to wear a purple shirt with velvet sleeves and scalloped edges. It had this in its favour, though. There were no bells on it. He had brought a bottle of sparkling wine and a bouquet of flowers, both of which had gone flat during the journey. He laid them on the table, and sat down by the embers of the fire. He rubbed his eyes. It had been a long day. He wasn\u0027t, he felt, a good king, but he\u0027d had a lifetime of working hard at being something he wasn\u0027t cut out to be, and he was persevering. As far as he could see, none of his predecessors had tried at all. So much to do, so much to repair, so much to organise . . . On top of it all there was the problem with the duchess. Somehow he\u0027d felt moved to put her in a decent cell in an airy tower. She was a widow, after all. He felt he ought to be kind to widows. But being kind to the duchess didn\u0027t seem to achieve much, she didn\u0027t understand it, she thought it was just weakness. He was dreadfully afraid that he might have to have her head cut off. No, being a king was no laughing matter. He brightened up at the thought. There was that to be said about it. And, after a while, he fell asleep. The duchess was not asleep. She was currently halfway down the castle wall on a rope of knotted sheets, having spent the previous day gradually chipping away the mortar around the bars of her window although, in truth, you could hack your way out of the average Lancre Castle wall with a piece of cheese. The fool! He\u0027d given her cutlery, and plenty of bedclothes! That was how these people reacted. They let their fear do their thinking for them. They were scared of her, even when they thought they had her in their power (and the weak never had the strong in their power, never truly in their power). If she\u0027d thrown herself in prison, she would have found considerable satisfaction in making herself regret she\u0027d ever been born. But they\u0027d just given her blankets, and worried about her. Well, she\u0027d be back. There was a big world out there, and she knew how to pull the levers that made people do what she wanted. She wouldn\u0027t burden herself with a husband this time, either. Weak! He was the worst of them, no courage in him to be as bad as he knew he was, inside. She landed heavily on the moss, paused to catch her breath and then, with the knife ready in her hand, slipped away along the castle walls and into the forest.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wyrd-sisters-discworld-6/page-40.html","bookId":1625,"book":{"id":1625,"title":"Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6)","description":"Storyline: Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6) Witches are not by nature gregarious, and they certainly don\u0027t have leaders.
