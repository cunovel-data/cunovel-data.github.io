I haven\u0027t had breakfast.\u0027\\n\\n The Fool lit a match. There was the faintest disturbance in the air beside him, and it went out. He swore, and tried another. This time his shaking hands managed to get it as far as the brazier before it, too, flared and darkened.\\n\\n \u0027Hurry up, man!\u0027 said the duchess, laying out a tray of tools.\\n\\n \u0027Doesn\u0027t seem to want to light—\u0027 muttered the Fool, as another match became a fluttering streak of flame and then went out.\\n\\n The duke snatched the box from his trembling fingers and caught him across the cheek with a handful of rings.\\n\\n \u0027Can no orders of mine be obeyed?\u0027 he screamed. \u0027Infirm of purpose! Weak! Give me the box!\u0027\\n\\n The Fool backed away. Someone he couldn\u0027t see was whispering things he couldn\u0027t quite make out in his ear.\\n\\n \u0027Go outside,\u0027 hissed the duke, \u0027and see that we are not disturbed!\u0027\\n\\n The Fool tripped over the bottom step, turned and, with a last imploring look at Nanny, scampered through the door He capered a little bit, out of force of habit.\\n\\n \u0027The fire isn\u0027t completely necessary,\u0027 said the Duchess. \u0027It merely assists. Now, woman, will you confess?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What to?\u0027 said Nanny.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s common knowledge. Treason. Malicious witchcraft. Harbouring the king\u0027s enemies. Theft of the crown—\u0027\\n\\n A tinkling noise made them look down. A blood-stained dagger had fallen off the bench, as though someone had tried to pick it up but just couldn\u0027t get the strength together. Nanm heard the king\u0027s ghost swear under\u0027its breath, or what would have been its breath.\\n\\n \u0027—and spreading false rumours,\u0027 finished the duchess.\\n\\n \u0027—salt in my food—\u0027 said the duke, nervously, staring at the bandages on his hand. He kept getting the feeling that there was a fourth person in the dungeon.\\n\\n \u0027If you do confess,\u0027 said the duchess, \u0027you will merely be burned at the stake. And, please, no humorous remarks.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What false rumours?\u0027\\n\\n The duke closed his eyes, but the visions were still there \u0027Concerning the accidental death of the late King Verence.\u0027 he whispered hoarsely. The air swirled again.\\n\\n Nanny sat with her head cocked to one side, as though listening to a voice only she could hear. Except that the duke was certain that he could hear something too, not exactly a voice, something like the distant sighing of the wind.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, I don\u0027t know nothing false,\u0027 she said. \u0027I know you stabbed him, and you gave him the dagger. It was at the top of the stairs.\u0027 She paused, head cocked, nodded, and added, \u0027Just by the suit of armour with the pike, and you said, “If it\u0027s to be done, it\u0027s better if it\u0027s done quickly”, or something, and then you snatched the king\u0027s own dagger, the very same what is now lying on the floor, out of his belt and—\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You lie! There were no witnesses. We made . . . there was nothing to witness! I heard someone in the dark, but there was no-one there! There couldn\u0027t have been anyone seeing anything!\u0027 screamed the duke. His wife scowled at him.\\n\\n \u0027Do shut up, Leonal,\u0027 she said. \u0027I think within these four walls we can dispense with that sort of thing.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Who told her? Did you tell her?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And calm down. No-one told her. She\u0027s a witch, for goodness sake, they find out about these things. Second glance, or something.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sight,\u0027 said Nanny.\\n\\n \u0027Which you will not possess much longer, my good woman, unless you tell us who else knows and indeed, assist us on a number of other matters,\u0027 said the duchess grimly. \u0027And you will do so, believe me. I am skilled in these things.\u0027\\n\\n Granny glanced around the dungeon. It was beginning to get crowded. King Verence was bursting with such angry vitality that he was very nearly apparent, and was furiously trying to get a grip on a knife. But there were others behind – wavering, broken shapes, not exactly ghosts but memories, implanted in the very substances of the walls themselves by sheer pain and terror.\\n\\n \u0027My own dagger! The bastards! They killed me with my own dagger,\u0027 said the ghost of King Verence silently, raising his transparent arms and imploring the netherworld in general to witness this ultimate humiliation. \u0027Give me strength . . .\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Nanny. \u0027It\u0027s worth a try.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And now we will commence,\u0027 said the duchess.\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027 said the guard.\\n\\n \u0027I SAID,\u0027 said Magrat, \u0027I\u0027ve come to sell my lovely apples. Don\u0027t you listen?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s not a sale on, is there?\u0027 The guard was extremely nervous since his colleague had been taken off to the infirmary. He hadn\u0027t taken the job in order to deal with this sort of thing.\\n\\n It dawned on him.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re not a witch, are you?\u0027 he said, fumbling awkwardly with his pike.\\n\\n \u0027Of course not. Do I look like one?\u0027\\n\\n The guard looked at her occult bangles, her lined cloak, her trembling hands and her face. The face was particulary worrying. Magrat had used a lot of powder to make her face pale and interesting. It combined with the lavishly applied mascara to give the guard the impression that he was looking at two flies that had crashed into a sugar bowl. He found his fingers wanted to make a sign to ward off the evil eyeshadow.\\n\\n \u0027Right,\u0027 he said uncertainly. His mind was grinding through the problem. She was a witch. Just lately there\u0027d been a lot of gossip about witches being bad for your health. He\u0027d been told not to let witches pass, but no-one had said anything about apple sellers. Apple sellers were not a problem. It was witches that were the problem. She\u0027d said she was an apple seller and he wasn\u0027t about to doubt a witch\u0027s word.\\n\\n Feeling happy with this application of logic, he stood to one side and gave an expansive wave.\\n\\n \u0027Pass, apple seller,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027Thank you,\u0027 said Magrat sweetly. \u0027Would you like an apple?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, thanks. I haven\u0027t finished the one the other witch gave me.\u0027 His eyes rolled. \u0027Not a witch. Not a witch, an apple seller An apple seller. She ought to know.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How long ago was this?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Just a few minutes . . .\u0027\\n\\n Granny Weatherwax was not lost. She wasn\u0027t the kind of person who ever became lost. It was just that, at the moment, while she knew exactly where SHE was, she didn\u0027t know the position of anywhere else. Currently she had arrived in the kitchens again, precipitating a breakdown in the cook, who was trying to roast some celery. The fact that several people had tried to buy apples from her wasn\u0027t improving her temper.\\n\\n Magrat found her way to the Great Hall, empty and deserted at this time of day except for a couple of guards who were playing dice. They wore the tabards of Felmet\u0027s own personal bodyguard, and stopped their game as soon as she appeared.\\n\\n \u0027Well, well,\u0027 said one, leering. \u0027Come to keep us company have you, my pretty.[12]\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I was looking for the dungeons,\u0027 said Magrat, to whom the words \u0027sexual harassment\u0027 were a mere collection of syllables.\\n\\n \u0027Just fancy,\u0027 said one of the guards, winking at the other. \u0027I reckon we can help you there.\u0027 They got up and stood either side of her; she was aware of two chins you could strike matches on and an overpowering smell of stale beer. Frantic signals from outlying portions of her mind began to break down her iron-hard conviction that bad things only happened to bad people.\\n\\n They escorted her down several flights of steps into a maze of dank, arched passageways as she sought hurriedly for some polite way of disengaging herself.\\n\\n \u0027I should warn you,\u0027 she said, \u0027I am not, as I may appear, a simple apple seller.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Fancy that.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I am, in fact, a witch.\u0027\\n\\n This did not make the impression she had hoped. The guards exchanged glances.\\n\\n \u0027Fair enough,\u0027 said one. \u0027I\u0027ve always wondered what it was like to kiss a witch. Around here they do say you gets turned into a frog.\u0027\\n\\n The other guard nudged him. \u0027I reckon, then,\u0027 he said, in the slow, ripe tones of one who thinks that what he is about to say next is going to be incredibly funny, \u0027you kissed one years ago.\u0027\\n\\n The brief guffaw was suddenly interrupted when Magrat was flung against the wall and treated to a close up view of the guard\u0027s nostrils.\\n\\n \u0027Now listen to me, sweetheart,\u0027 he said. \u0027You ain\u0027t the first witch we\u0027ve had down here, if witch you be, but you could be lucky and walk out again. If you are nice to us, d\u0027you see?\u0027\\n\\n There was a shrill, short scream from somewhere nearby.\\n\\n \u0027That, you see,\u0027 said the guard, \u0027was a witch having it the hard way. You could do us all a favour, see? Lucky you met us, really.\u0027\\n\\n His questing hand stopped its wandering. \u0027What\u0027s this?\u0027 he said to Magrat\u0027s pale face. \u0027A knife? A knife? I reckon we\u0027ve got to take that very seriously, don\u0027t you, Hron?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You got to tie her hands and gag her,\u0027 said Hron hurriedly.\\n\\n \u0027They can\u0027t do no magic if they can\u0027t speak or wave their hands about . . .\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You can take your hands off her!\u0027\\n\\n All three stared down the passage at the Fool. He was jingling with rage.\\n\\n \u0027Let her go this minute!\u0027 he shouted. \u0027Or I\u0027ll report you!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, you\u0027ll report us, will you?\u0027 said Hron. \u0027And will anyone listen to you, you earwax-coloured little twerp?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027This is a witch we have here,\u0027 said the other guard. \u0027So you can go and tinkle somewhere else.\u0027 He turned back to Magrat. \u0027I like a girl with spirit,\u0027 he said, incorrectly as it turned out.\\n\\n The Fool advanced with the bravery of the terminally angry.\\n\\n \u0027I told you to let her go,\u0027 he repeated.\\n\\n Hron drew his sword and winked at his companion.\\n\\n Magrat struck. It was an unplanned, instinctive blow, its stopping power considerably enhanced by the weight of rings and bangles; her arm whirred around in an arc that connected with her captor\u0027s jaw and spun him twice before he folded up in a heap with a quiet little sigh, and incidentally with several symbols of occult significance embossed on his cheek.\\n\\n Hron gaped at him, and then looked at Magrat. He raised his sword at about the same moment that the Fool cannoned into him, and the two men went down in a struggling heap Like most small men the Fool relied on the initial mad rush to secure an advantage and was at a loss for a follow-through and it would probably have gone hard with him if Hron hadn\u0027t suddenly become aware that a breadknife was pressed to his neck.\\n\\n \u0027Let go of him,\u0027 said Magrat, pushing her hair out of her eyes.\\n\\n He stiffened. \u0027You\u0027re wondering whether I really would cut your throat,\u0027 panted Magrat. \u0027I don\u0027t know either. Think of the fun we could have together, finding out.\u0027\\n\\n She reached down with her other hand and hauled the Few to his feet by his collar.\\n\\n \u0027Where did that scream come from?\u0027 she said, without taking her eyes off the guard.\\n\\n \u0027It was down this way. They\u0027ve got her in the torture dungeon and I don\u0027t like it, it\u0027s going too far, and I couldn\u0027t get in and I came to look for someone—\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, you\u0027ve found me,\u0027 said Magrat.\\n\\n \u0027You,\u0027 she said to Hron, \u0027will stay here. Or run away, for all I care. But you won\u0027t follow us.\u0027\\n\\n He nodded, and stared after them as they hurried down the passage. \u0027The door\u0027s locked,\u0027 said the Fool. \u0027There\u0027s all sorts of noises, but the door\u0027s locked.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, it\u0027s a dungeon, isn\u0027t it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They\u0027re not supposed to lock from the inside!\u0027\\n\\n It was, indeed, unbudgeable. Silence came from the other side – a busy, thick silence that crawled through the cracks and spilled out into the passage, a kind of silence that is worse than screams.\\n\\n The Fool hopped from one foot to the other as Magrat explored the door\u0027s rough surface.\\n\\n \u0027Are you really a witch?\u0027 he said. \u0027They said you were a witch, are you really? You don\u0027t look like a witch, you look very . . . that is . . .\u0027He blushed. \u0027Not like a, you know, crone at all, but absolutely beautiful . . .\u0027 His voice trailed into silence . . .\\n\\n I am totally in control of the situation, Magrat told herself. I never thought I would be, but I am thinking absolutely clearly. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wyrd-sisters-discworld-6/page-18.html","bookId":1625,"book":{"id":1625,"title":"Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6)","description":"Storyline: Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6) \\n Witches are not by nature gregarious, and they certainly don\u0027t have leaders.
