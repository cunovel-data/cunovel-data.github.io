{"id":95577,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"\u0027What are you going to try?\u0027 said Granny. Since they were on Nanny\u0027s territory, the choice was entirely up to her. \u0027I always say you can\u0027t go wrong with a good Invocation,\u0027 said Nanny. \u0027Haven\u0027t done one for years.\u0027 Granny Weatherwax frowned. Magrat said, \u0027Oh, but you can\u0027t. Not here. You need a cauldron, and a magic sword. And an octogram. And spices, and all sorts of stuff.\u0027 Granny and Nanny exchanged glances. \u0027It\u0027s not her fault,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027It\u0027s all them grimmers she was bought.\u0027 She turned to Magrat. \u0027You don\u0027t need none of that,\u0027 she said. \u0027You need head-ology.\u0027 She looked around the ancient washroom. \u0027You just use whatever you\u0027ve got,\u0027 she said. She picked up the bleached copper stick, and weighed it thoughtfully in her hand. \u0027We conjure and abjure thee by means of this—\u0027 Granny hardly paused – \u0027sharp and terrible copper stick.\u0027 The waters in the boiler rippled gently. \u0027See how we scatter—\u0027 Magrat sighed – \u0027rather old washing soda and some extremely hard soap flakes in thy honour. Really, Nanny, I don\u0027t think—\u0027 \u0027Silence! Now you, Gytha.\u0027 \u0027And I invoke and bind thee with the balding scrubbing brush of Art and the washboard of Protection,\u0027 said Nanny, waving it. The wringer attachment fell off. \u0027Honesty is all very well,\u0027 whispered Magrat, wretchedly, \u0027but somehow it isn\u0027t the same.\u0027 \u0027You listen to me, my girl,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027Demons don\u0027t care about the outward shape of things. It\u0027s what you think that matters. Get on with it.\u0027 Magrat tried to imagine that the bleached and ancient bar of lye soap was the rarest of scented whatever, ungulants or whatever they were, from distant Klatch. It was an effort. The gods alone knew what kind of demon would respond to a summoning like this. Granny was also a little uneasy. She didn\u0027t much care for demons in any case, and all this business with incantations and implements whiffed of wizardry. It was pandering to the things, making them feel important. Demons ought to come when they were called. But protocol dictated that the host witch had the choice, and Nanny quite liked demons, who were male, or apparently so. At this point Granny was alternately cajoling and threatening the nether world with two feet of bleached wood. She was impressed at her own daring. The waters seethed a little, became very still and then, with a sudden movement and a little popping noise, mounded up into a head. Magrat dropped her soap. It was a good-looking head, maybe a little cruel around the eyes and beaky about the nose-, but nevertheless handsome in a hard kind of way. There was nothing surprising about this; since the demon was only extending an image of itself into this reality, it might as well make a good job of it. It turned slowly, a gleaming black statue in the fitful moonlight. \u0027Well?\u0027 it said. \u0027Who\u0027re you?\u0027 said Granny, bluntly. The head revolved to face her. \u0027My name is unpronounceable in your tongue, woman,\u0027 it said. \u0027I\u0027ll be the judge of that,\u0027 warned Granny, and added, \u0027Don\u0027t you call me woman.\u0027 \u0027Very well. My name is WxrtHltl-jwlpklz,\u0027 said the demon smugly. \u0027Where were you when the vowels were handed out? Behind the door?\u0027 said Nanny Ogg. \u0027Well, Mr— Granny hesitated only fractionally – \u0027WxrtHltl-jwlpklz, I expect you\u0027re wondering why we called you here tonight.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re not supposed to say that,\u0027 said the demon. \u0027 You\u0027re supposed to say—\u0027 \u0027Shut up. We have the sword of Art and the octogram of Protection, I warn you.\u0027 \u0027Please yourself. They look like a washboard and a copper stick to me,\u0027 sneered the demon. Granny glanced sideways. The corner of the washroom was stacked with kindling wood, with a big heavy sawhorse in front of it. She stared fixedly at the demon and, without looking, brought the stick down hard across the, thick timber. The dead silence that followed was broken only by the two perfectly-sliced halves of the sawhorse teetering backwards and forwards and folding slowly into the heap of kindling. The demon\u0027s face remained impassive. \u0027You are allowed three questions,\u0027 it said. \u0027Is there something strange at large in the kingdom?\u0027 said Granny. It appeared to think about it. \u0027And no lying,\u0027 said Magrat earnestly. \u0027Otherwise it\u0027ll be the scrubbing brush for you.\u0027 \u0027You mean stranger than usual?\u0027 \u0027Get on with it,\u0027 said Nanny. \u0027My feet are freezing out here.\u0027 \u0027No. There is nothing strange.\u0027 \u0027But we felt it—\u0027 Magrat began. \u0027Hold on, hold on,\u0027 said Granny. Her lips moved soundlessly. Demons were like genies or philosophy professors — if you didn\u0027t word things exactly right, they delighted in giving you absolutely accurate and completely misleading answers. \u0027Is there something in the kingdom that wasn\u0027t there before?\u0027 she hazarded. \u0027No.\u0027 Tradition said that there could be only three questions. Granny tried to formulate one that couldn\u0027t be deliberately misunderstood. Then she decided that this was playing the wrong kind of game. \u0027What the hell\u0027s going on?\u0027 she said carefully. \u0027And no mucking about trying to wriggle out of it, otherwise I\u0027ll boil you.\u0027 The demon appeared to hesitate. This was obviously a new approach. \u0027Magrat, just kick that kindling over here, will you?\u0027 said Granny. \u0027I protest at this treatment,\u0027 said the demon, its voice tinged with uncertainty. \u0027Yes, well, we haven\u0027t got time to bandy legs with you all night,\u0027 said Granny. These word games might be all right for wizards, but we\u0027ve got other fish to fry.\u0027 \u0027Or boil,\u0027 said Nanny. \u0027Look,\u0027 said the demon, and now there was a whine of terror in its voice. \u0027We\u0027re not supposed to volunteer information just like that. There are rules, you know.\u0027 \u0027There\u0027s some old oil in the can on the shelf, Magrat,\u0027 said Nanny. \u0027If I simply tell you—\u0027 the demon began. \u0027Yes?\u0027 said Granny, encouragingly. \u0027You won\u0027t let on, will you?\u0027 it implored. \u0027Not a word,\u0027 promised Granny. \u0027Lips are sealed,\u0027 said Magrat. \u0027There is nothing new in the kingdom,\u0027 said the demon, \u0027but the land has woken up.\u0027 \u0027What do you mean?\u0027 said Granny. \u0027It\u0027s unhappy. It wants a king that cares for it.\u0027 \u0027How—\u0027 Magrat began, but Granny waved her into silence. \u0027You don\u0027t mean people, do you?\u0027 she said. The glistening head shook. \u0027No, I didn\u0027t think so.\u0027 \u0027What—\u0027 Nanny began. Granny put a finger to her lips. She turned and walked to the washhouse\u0027s window, a dusty spiderweb graveyard of faded butterfly wings and last summer\u0027s bluebottles. A faint glow beyond the frosted panes suggested that, against all reason, a new day would soon dawn. \u0027Can you tell us why?\u0027 she said, without turning round. She\u0027d felt the mind of a whole country . . . She was rather impressed. \u0027I\u0027m just a demon. What do I know? Only what is, not the why and how of it.\u0027 \u0027I see.\u0027 \u0027May I go now?\u0027 \u0027Um?\u0027 \u0027Please?\u0027 Granny jerked upright again. \u0027Oh. Yes. Run along,\u0027 she said distractedly. \u0027Thank you.\u0027 The head didn\u0027t move. It hung around, like a hotel porter who has just carried fifteen suitcases up ten flights of stairs, shown everyone where the bathroom is, plumped up the pillows, and feels he has adjusted all the curtains he is going to adjust. \u0027You wouldn\u0027t mind banishing me, would you?\u0027 said the demon, when no-one seemed to be taking the hint. \u0027What?\u0027 said Granny, who was thinking again. \u0027Only I\u0027d feel better for being properly banished. “Run along” lacks that certain something,\u0027 said the head. \u0027Oh. Well, if it gives you any pleasure. Magrat!\u0027 \u0027Yes?\u0027 said Magrat, startled. Granny tossed the copper stick to her. \u0027Do the honours, will you?\u0027 she said. Magrat caught the stick by what she hoped Granny was imagining as the handle, and smiled. \u0027Certainly. Right. Okay. Um. Begone, foul fiend, unto the blackest pit—\u0027 The head smiled contentedly as the words rolled over it. This was more like it. It melted back into the waters of the copper like candlewax under a flame. Its last contemptuous comment, almost lost in the swirl, was, \u0027Run aaaalonggg . . .\u0027 Granny went home alone as the cold pink light of dawn glided across the snow, and let herself into her cottage. The goats were uneasy in their outhouse. The starlings muttered and rattled their false teeth under the roof. The mice were squeaking behind the kitchen dresser. She made a pot of tea, conscious that every sound in the kitchen seemed slightly louder than it ought to be. When she dropped the spoon into the sink it sounded like a bell being hit with a hammer. She always felt uncomfortable after getting involved in organised magic or, as she would put it, out of sorts with herself. She found herself wandering around the place looking for things to do and then forgetting them when they were half-complete. She paced back and forth across the cold flagstones. It is at times like this that the mind finds the oddest jobs to do in order to avoid its primary purpose, i.e., thinking about things. If anyone had been watching they would have been amazed at the sheer dedication with which Granny tackled such tasks as cleaning the teapot stand, rooting ancient nuts out of the fruit bowl on the dresser, and levering fossilised bread crusts out of the cracks in the flagstones with the back of a teaspoon. Animals had minds. People had minds, although human minds were vague foggy things. Even insects had minds, little pointy bits of light in the darkness of non-mind. Granny considered herself something of an expert on minds. She was pretty certain things like countries didn\u0027t have minds. They weren\u0027t even alive, for goodness sake. A country was, well, was— Hold on. Hold on . . . A thought stole gently into Granny\u0027s mind and sheepishly tried to attract her attention. There was a way in which those brooding forests could have a mind. Granny sat up, a piece of antique loaf in her hand, and gazed speculatively at the fireplace. Her mind\u0027s eye looked through it, out at the snow-filled aisles of trees. Yes. It had never occurred to her before. Of course, it\u0027d be a mind made up of all the other little minds inside it; plant minds, bird minds, bear minds, even the great slow minds of the trees themselves . . . She sat down in her rocking chair, which started to rock all by itself. She\u0027d often thought of the forest as a sprawling creature, but only metterforicaily, as a wizard would put it; drowsy and purring with bumblebees in the summer, roaring and raging in autumn gales, curled in on itself and sleeping in the winter. It occurred to her that in addition to being a collection of other things, the forest was a thing in itself. Alive, only not alive in the way that, say, a shrew was alive. And much slower. That would have to be important. How fast did a forest\u0027s heart beat? Once a year, maybe. Yes, that sounded about right. Out there the forest was waiting for the brighter sun and longer days that would pump a million gallons of sap several hundred feet into the sky in one great systolic thump too big and loud to be heard. And it was at about this point that Granny bit her lip. She\u0027d just thought the word \u0027systolic\u0027, and it certainly wasn\u0027t in her vocabulary. Somebody was inside her head with her. Some thing. Had she just thought all those thoughts, or had they been thought through her? She glared at the floor, trying to keep her ideas to herself. But her mind was being watched as easily as if her head was made of glass. Granny Weatherwax got to her feet and opened the curtains. And they were out there on what – in warmer months -was the lawn. And every single one of them was staring at her.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wyrd-sisters-discworld-6/page-12.html","bookId":1625,"book":{"id":1625,"title":"Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6)","description":"Storyline: Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6) Witches are not by nature gregarious, and they certainly don\u0027t have leaders.
