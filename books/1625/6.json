{"id":95571,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"\u0027Well!\u0027 said the duchess. \u0027Indeed.\u0027 \u0027That was how your family used to run a kingdom, was it? You had a positive duty to kill your cousin. It was clearly in the interests of the species,\u0027 said the duchess. \u0027The weak don\u0027t deserve to survive.\u0027 The duke shivered. She would keep on reminding him. He didn\u0027t, on the whole, object to killing people, or at least ordering them to be killed and then watching it happen. But killing a kinsman rather stuck in the throat or – he recalled – the liver. \u0027Quite so,\u0027 he managed. \u0027Of course, there would appear to be many witches, and it might be difficult to find the three that were on the moor.\u0027 \u0027That doesn\u0027t matter.\u0027 \u0027Of course not.\u0027 \u0027Put matters in hand.\u0027 \u0027Yes, my love.\u0027 Matters in hand. He\u0027d put matters in hand all right. If he closed his eyes he could see the body tumbling down the steps. Had there been a hiss of shocked breath, down in the darkness of the hall? He\u0027d been certain they were alone. Matters in hand! He\u0027d tried to wash the blood off his hand. If he could wash the blood off, he told himself, it wouldn\u0027t have happened. He\u0027d scrubbed and scrubbed. Scrubbed till he screamed. Granny wasn\u0027t at home in public houses. She sat stiffly to attention behind her port-and-lemon, as if it were a shield against the lures of the world. Nanny Ogg, on the other hand, was enthusiastically downing her third drink and, Granny thought sourly, was well along that path which would probably end up with her usual dancing on the table, showing her petticoats and singing \u0027The Hedgehog Can Never be Buggered at All\u0027. The table was covered with copper coins. Vitoller and his wife sat at either end, counting. It was something of a race. Granny considered Mrs Vitoller as she snatched farthings from under her husband\u0027s fingers. She was an intelligent-looking woman, who appeared to treat her husband much as a sheepdog treats a favourite lamb. The complexities of the marital relationship were known to Granny only from a distance, in the same way that an astronomer can view the surface of a remote and alien world, but it had already occurred to her that a wife to Vitoller would have to be a very special woman with bottomless reserves of patience and organisational ability and nimble fingers. \u0027Mrs Vitoller,\u0027 she said eventually, \u0027may I make so bold as to ask if your union has been blessed with fruit?\u0027 The couple looked blank. \u0027She means—\u0027 Nanny Ogg began. \u0027No, I see,\u0027 said Mrs Vitoller, quietly. \u0027No. We had a little girl once.\u0027 A small cloud hung over the table. For a second or two Vitoller looked merely human-sized, and much older. He stared at the small pile of cash in front of him. \u0027Only, you see, there is this child,\u0027 said Granny, indicating the baby in Nanny Ogg\u0027s arms. \u0027And he needs a home.\u0027 The Vitollers stared. Then the man sighed. \u0027It is no life for a child,\u0027 he said. \u0027Always moving. Always a new town. And no room for schooling. They say that\u0027s very important these days.\u0027 But his eyes didn\u0027t look away. Mrs Vitoller said, \u0027Why does he need a home?\u0027 \u0027He hasn\u0027t got one,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027At least, not one where he would be welcome.\u0027 The silence continued. Then Mrs Vitoller said, \u0027And you, who ask this, you are by way of being his—?\u0027 \u0027Godmothers,\u0027 said Nanny Ogg promptly. Granny was slightly taken aback. It never would have occurred to her. Vitoller played abstractly with the coins in front of him. His wife reached out across the table and touched his hand, and there was a moment of unspoken communion. Granny looked away. She had grown expert at reading faces, but there were times when she preferred not to. \u0027Money is, alas, tight—\u0027 Vitoller began. \u0027But it will stretch,\u0027 said his wife firmly. \u0027Yes. I think it will. We should be happy to take care of him.\u0027 Granny nodded, and fished in the deepest recesses of her cloak. At last she produced a small leather bag, which she tipped out on to the table. There was a lot of silver, and even a few tiny gold coins. \u0027This should take care of—\u0027 she groped – \u0027nappies and suchlike. Clothes and things. Whatever.\u0027 \u0027A hundred times over, I should think,\u0027 said Vitoller weakly. \u0027Why didn\u0027t you mention this before?\u0027 \u0027If I\u0027d had to buy you, you wouldn\u0027t be worth the price.\u0027 \u0027But you doh\u0027t know anything about us!\u0027 said Mrs Vitoller. \u0027We don\u0027t, do we?\u0027 said Granny, calmly. \u0027Naturally we\u0027d like to hear how he gets along. You could send us letters and suchlike. But it would not be a good idea to talk about all this after you\u0027ve left, do you see? For the sake of the child.\u0027 Mrs Vitoller looked at the two old women. \u0027There\u0027s something else here, isn\u0027t there?\u0027 she said. \u0027Something big behind all this?\u0027 Granny hesitated, and then nodded. \u0027But it would do us no good at all to know it?\u0027 Another nod. Granny stood up as several actors came in, breaking the spell. Actors had a habit of filling all the space around them. \u0027I have other things to see to,\u0027 she said. \u0027Please excuse me.\u0027 \u0027What\u0027s his name?\u0027 said Vitoller. \u0027Tom,\u0027 said Granny, hardly hesitating. \u0027John,\u0027 said Nanny. The two witches exchanged glances. Granny won. \u0027Tom John,\u0027 she said firmly, and swept out. She met a breathless Magrat outside the door. \u0027I found a box,\u0027 she said. \u0027It had all the crowns and things in. So I put it in, like you said, right underneath everything.\u0027 \u0027Good,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027Our crown looked really tatty compared to the others!\u0027 \u0027It just goes to show, doesn\u0027t it,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027Did anyone see you?\u0027 \u0027No, everyone was too busy, but—\u0027 Magrat hesitated, and blushed. \u0027Out with it, girl.\u0027 \u0027Just after that a man came up and pinched my bottom.\u0027 Magrat went a deep crimson and slapped her hand over her mouth. \u0027Did he?\u0027 said Granny. \u0027And then what?\u0027 \u0027And then, and then—\u0027 \u0027Yes?\u0027 \u0027He said, he said—\u0027 \u0027What did he say?\u0027 \u0027He said, “Hallo, my lovely, what are you doing tonight?” \u0027 Granny ruminated on this for a while and then she said, \u0027Old Goodie Whemper, she didn\u0027t get out and about much, did she?\u0027 \u0027It was her leg, you know,\u0027 said Magrat. \u0027But she taught you all the midwifery and everything?\u0027 \u0027Oh, yes, that,\u0027 said Magrat. \u0027I done lots.\u0027 \u0027But—\u0027 Granny hesitated, groping her way across unfamiliar territory – \u0027she never talked about what you might call the previous.\u0027 \u0027Sorry?\u0027 \u0027You know,\u0027 said Granny, with an edge of desperation in her voice. \u0027Men and such.\u0027 Magrat looked as if she was about to panic. \u0027What about them?\u0027 Granny Weatherwax had done many unusual things in her time, and it took a lot to make her refuse a challenge. But this time she gave in. \u0027I think,\u0027 she said helplessly, \u0027that it might be a good idea if you have a quiet word with Nanny Ogg one of these days. Fairly soon.\u0027 There was a cackle of laughter from the window behind them, a chink of glasses, and a thin voice raised in song: —with a giraffe, If you stand on a stool. But the hedgehog—\u0027 Granny stopped listening. \u0027Only not just now,\u0027 she added. The troupe got under way a few hours before sunset, their four carts lurching off down the road that led towards the Sto plains and the big cities. Lancre had a town rule that all mummers, mountebanks and other potential criminals were outside the gates by sundown; it didn\u0027t offend anyone really because the town had no walls to speak of, and no-one much minded if people nipped back in again after dark. It was the look of the thing that counted. The witches watched from Magrat\u0027s cottage, using Nanny Ogg\u0027s ancient green crystal ball. \u0027It\u0027s about time you learned how to get sound on this thing,\u0027 Granny muttered. She gave it a nudge, filling the image with ripples. \u0027It was very strange,\u0027 said Magrat. \u0027In those carts. The things they had! Paper trees, and all kinds of costumes, and—\u0027 she waved her hands – \u0027there was this great big picture of forn parts, with all temples and things all rolled up. It was beautiful.\u0027 Granny grunted. \u0027I thought it was amazing the way all those people became kings and things, didn\u0027t you? It was like magic.\u0027 \u0027Magrat Garlick, what are you saying? It was just paint and paper. Anyone could see that.\u0027 Magrat opened her mouth to speak, ran the ensuing argument through her head, and shut it again. \u0027Where\u0027s Nanny?\u0027 she said. \u0027She\u0027s lying out on the lawn,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027She felt a bit poorly.\u0027 And from outside came the sound of Nanny Ogg being poorly at the top of her voice. Magrat sighed. \u0027You know,\u0027 she said, \u0027if we are his godmothers, we ought to have given him three gifts. It\u0027s traditional.\u0027 \u0027What are you talking about, girl?\u0027 \u0027Three good witches are supposed to give the baby three gifts. You know, like good looks, wisdom and happiness.\u0027 Magrat pressed on defiantly. \u0027That\u0027s how it used to be done in the old days.\u0027 \u0027Oh, you mean gingerbread cottages and all that,\u0027 said Granny dismissively. \u0027Spinning wheels and pumpkins and pricking your finger on rose thorns and similar. I could never be having with all that.\u0027 She polished the ball reflectively. \u0027Yes, but—\u0027 Magrat said. Granny glanced up at her. That was Magrat for you. Head full of pumpkins. Everyone\u0027s fairy godmother, for two pins. But a good soul, underneath it all. Kind to small furry animals. The sort of person who worried about baby birds falling out of nests. \u0027Look, if it makes you any happier,\u0027 she muttered, surprised at herself. She waved her hands vaguely over the image of the departing carts. \u0027What\u0027s it to be – wealth, beauty?\u0027 \u0027Well, money isn\u0027t everything, and if he takes after his father he\u0027ll be handsome enough,\u0027 Magrat said, suddenly serious. \u0027Wisdom, do you think?\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s something he\u0027ll have to learn for himself,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027Perfect eyesight? A good singing voice?\u0027 From the lawn outside came Nanny Ogg\u0027s cracked but enthusiastic voice telling the night sky that A Wizard\u0027s Staff Has A Knob On The End. \u0027Not important,\u0027 said Granny loudly. \u0027You\u0027ve got to think headology, see? Not muck about with all this beauty and. wealth business. That\u0027s not important.\u0027 She turned back to the ball and gestured half-heartedly. \u0027You\u0027d better go and get Nanny, then, seeing as there should be three of us.\u0027 Nanny was helped in, eventually, and had to have things explained to her. \u0027Three gifts, eh?\u0027 she said. \u0027Haven\u0027t done one of them things since I was a gel, it takes me back – what\u0027re you doing?\u0027 Magrat was bustling around the room, lighting candles. \u0027Oh, we\u0027ve got to create the right magical ambience,\u0027 she explained. Granny shrugged, but said nothing, even in the face of the extreme provocation. All witches did their magic in their own way, and this was Magrat\u0027s house. \u0027What\u0027re we going to give him, then?\u0027 said Nanny. \u0027We was just discussing it,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027I know what he\u0027ll want,\u0027 said Nanny. She made a suggestion, which was received in frozen silence. \u0027I don\u0027t see what use that would be,\u0027 said Magrat, eventually. \u0027Wouldn\u0027t it be rather uncomfortable?\u0027 \u0027He\u0027ll thank us when he grows up, you mark my words,\u0027 said Nanny. \u0027My first husband, he always said—\u0027 \u0027Something a bit less physical is generally the style of things,\u0027 interrupted Granny, glaring at Nanny Ogg. \u0027There\u0027s no need to go and spoil everything, Gytha. Why do you always have to—\u0027 \u0027Well, at least I can say that I—\u0027 Nanny began. Both voices faded to a mutter. There was a long edgy silence. \u0027I think,\u0027 said Magrat, with brittle brightness, \u0027that perhaps it would be a good idea if we all go back to our little cottages and do it in our own way. You know. Separately. It\u0027s been a long day and we\u0027re all rather tired.\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wyrd-sisters-discworld-6/page-6.html","bookId":1625,"book":{"id":1625,"title":"Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6)","description":"Storyline: Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6) Witches are not by nature gregarious, and they certainly don\u0027t have leaders.
