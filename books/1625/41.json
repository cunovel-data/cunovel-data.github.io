By morning she\u0027d be too far away for them ever to find her, and she doubted very much that they\u0027d ever come looking.\n Weak!\n She moved through the forest with surprising speed. There were tracks, after all, wide enough for carts, and she had a pretty good sense of direction. Besides, all she needed to do was go downhill. If she found the gorge then she just had to follow the flow.\n And then there seemed to be too many trees. There was still a track, and it went more or less in the right direction, but the trees on either side of it were planted rather more thickly than one might expect and, when she tried to turn back, there was no track at all behind her. She took to turning suddenly, half expecting to see the trees moving, but they were always standing stoically and firmly rooted in the moss.\n She couldn\u0027t feel a wind, but there was a sighing in the treetops.\n \u0027All right,\u0027 she said, under her breath. \u0027All right. I\u0027m going anyway. I want to go. But I will be back.\u0027\n It was at this point that the track opened out into a clearing that hadn\u0027t been there the day before and wouldn\u0027t be there tomorrow, a clearing in which the moonlight glittered off assembled antlers and fangs and serried ranks of glowing eyes.\n The weak banded together can be pretty despicable, but it dawned on the duchess that an alliance of the strong can be more of an immediate problem.\n There was total silence for a few seconds, broken only by a faint panting, and then the duchess grinned, raised her knife, and charged the lot of them.\n The front ranks of the massed creatures opened to let her pass, and then closed in again. Even the rabbits.\n The kingdom exhaled.\n On the moors under the very shadow of the peaks the mighty nocturnal chorus of nature had fallen silent. The crickets had ceased their chirping, the owls had hooted themselves into silence, and the wolves had other matters to attend to.\n There was a song that echoed and boomed from cliff to cliff, and resounded up the high hidden valleys, causing miniature avalanches. It funnelled along the secret tunnels under glaciers, losing all meaning as it rang between the walls of ice.\n To find out what was actually being sung you would have to go all the way back down to the dying fire by the standing stone, where the cross-resonances and waves of conflicting echoes focused on a small, elderly woman who was waving an empty bottle.\n \u0027—with a snail if you slow to a crawl, but the hedgehog—\u0027\n \u0027It tastes better at the bottom of the bottle, doesn\u0027t it,\u0027 Magrat said, trying to drown out the chorus.\n \u0027That\u0027s right,\u0027 said Granny, draining her cup.\n \u0027Is there any more?\u0027\n \u0027I think Gytha finished it, by the sound of it.\u0027\n They sat on the fragrant heather and stared up at the moon.\n \u0027Well, we\u0027ve got a king,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027And there\u0027s an end of it.\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s thanks to you and Nanny, really,\u0027 said Magrat, and hiccupped.\n \u0027Why?\u0027\n \u0027None of them would have believed me if you hadn\u0027t spoken up.\u0027\n \u0027Only because we was asked,\u0027 said Granny.\n \u0027Yes, but everyone knows witches don\u0027t lie, that\u0027s the important thing. I mean, everyone could see they looked so alike, but that could have been coincidence. You see,\u0027 Magrat blushed, \u0027I looked up droit de seigneur. Goodie Whemper had a dictionary.\u0027\n Nanny Ogg stopped singing.\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Granny Weatherwax. \u0027Well.\u0027\n Magrat became aware of an uncomfortable atmosphere.\n \u0027You did tell the truth, didn\u0027t you?\u0027 she said. \u0027They really are brothers, aren\u0027t they?\u0027\n \u0027Oh yes,\u0027 said Gytha Ogg. \u0027Definitely. I saw to his mother when your – when the new king was born. And to the queen when young Tomjon was born, and she told me who his father was.\u0027\n \u0027Gytha!\u0027\n \u0027Sorry.\u0027\n The wine was going to her head, but the wheels in Magrat\u0027s mind still managed to turn.\n \u0027Just a minute,\u0027 she said.\n \u0027I remember the Fool\u0027s father,\u0027 said Nanny Ogg, speaking slowly and deliberately. \u0027Very personable young man, he was. He didn\u0027t get on with his dad, you know, but he used to visit sometimes. To see old friends.\u0027\n \u0027He made friends easily,\u0027 said Granny.\n \u0027Among the ladies,\u0027 agreed Nanny. \u0027Very athletic, wasn\u0027t he? Could climb walls like nobody\u0027s business, I remember hearing.\u0027\n \u0027He was very popular at court,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027I know that much.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, yes. With the queen, at any rate.\u0027\n \u0027The king used to go out hunting such a lot,\u0027 said Granny.\n \u0027It was that droit of his,\u0027 said Nanny. \u0027Always out and about with it, he was. Hardly ever home o\u0027nights.\u0027\n \u0027Just a minute,\u0027 Magrat repeated.\n They looked at her.\n \u0027Yes?\u0027 said Granny.\n \u0027You told everyone they were brothers and that Verence was the older!\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s right.\u0027\n \u0027And you let everyone believe that—\u0027\n Granny Weatherwax pulled her shawl around her.\n \u0027We\u0027re bound to be truthful,\u0027 she said. \u0027But there\u0027s no call to be honest.\u0027\n \u0027No, no, what you\u0027re saying is that the King of Lancre isn\u0027t really—\u0027\n \u0027What I\u0027m saying is,\u0027 said Granny firmly, \u0027that we\u0027ve got a king who is no worse than most and better than many and who\u0027s got his head screwed on right—\u0027\n \u0027Even if it is against the thread,\u0027 said Nanny.\n \u0027—and the old king\u0027s ghost has been laid to rest happy, there\u0027s been an enjoyable coronation and some of us got mugs we weren\u0027t entitled to, them being only for the kiddies and, all in all, things are a lot more satisfactory than they might be. That\u0027s what I\u0027m saying. Never mind what should be or what might be or what ought to be. It\u0027s what things are that\u0027s important.\u0027\n \u0027But he\u0027s not really a king!\u0027\n \u0027He might be,\u0027 said Nanny.\n \u0027But you just said—\u0027\n \u0027Who knows? The late queen wasn\u0027t very good at counting. Anyway, he doesn\u0027t know he isn\u0027t royalty.\u0027\n \u0027And you\u0027re not going to tell him, are you?\u0027 said Granny Weatherwax.\n Magrat stared at the moon, which had a few clouds across it.\n \u0027No,\u0027 she said.\n \u0027Right, then,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027Anyway, look at it like this. Royalty has to start somewhere. It might as well start with him. It looks as though he means to take it seriously, which is a lot further than most of them take it. He\u0027ll do.\u0027\n Magrat knew she had lost. You always lost against Granny Weatherwax, the only interest was in seeing exactly how. \u0027But I\u0027m surprised at the two of you, I really am,\u0027 she said. \u0027You\u0027re witches. That means you have to care about things like truth and tradition and destiny, don\u0027t you?\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s where you\u0027ve been getting it all wrong,\u0027 said Granny, \u0027Destiny is important, see, but people go wrong when they think it controls them. It\u0027s the other way around.\u0027\n \u0027Bugger destiny,\u0027 agreed Nanny.\n Granny glared at her.\n \u0027After all, you never thought being a witch was going to be easy, did you?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m learning,\u0027 said Magrat. She looked across the moor, where a thin rind of dawn glowed on the horizon.\n \u0027I think I\u0027d better be off,\u0027 she said. \u0027It\u0027s getting early.\u0027\n \u0027Me too,\u0027 said Nanny Ogg. \u0027Our Shirl frets if I\u0027m not home when she comes to get my breakfast.\u0027\n Granny carefully scuffed over the remains of the fire.\n \u0027When shall we three meet again?\u0027 she said. \u0027Hmm?\u0027\n The witches looked at one another sheepishly.\n \u0027I\u0027m a bit busy next month,\u0027 said Nanny. \u0027Birthdays and such. Er. And the work has really been piling up with all this hurly-burly. You know. And there\u0027s all the ghosts to think about.\u0027\n \u0027I thought you sent them back to the castle,\u0027 said Granny.\n \u0027Well, they didn\u0027t want to go,\u0027 said Nanny vaguely. \u0027To be honest, I\u0027ve got used to them around the place. They\u0027re company of an evening. They hardly scream at all, now.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s nice,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027What about you, Magrat?\u0027\n \u0027There always seems to be such a lot to do at this time of year, don\u0027t you find?\u0027 said Magrat.\n \u0027Quite,\u0027 said Granny Weatherwax, pleasantly. \u0027It\u0027s no good getting yourself tied down to appointments all the time, is it? Let\u0027s just leave the whole question open, shall we?\u0027\n They nodded. And, as the new day wound across the landscape, each one busy with her own thoughts, each one a witch alone, they went home.[23]\n The End \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wyrd-sisters-discworld-6/page-41.html","bookId":1625,"book":{"id":1625,"title":"Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6)","description":"Storyline: \n Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6) \n Witches are not by nature gregarious, and they certainly don\u0027t have leaders.
