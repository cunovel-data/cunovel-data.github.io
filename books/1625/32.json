{"id":95597,"no":32,"title":"Page 32","content":"The same magic didn\u0027t seem to infuse the new play. They tried it a few times, just to see how it went. The audience watched attentively, and went home. They didn\u0027t even bother to throw anything. It wasn\u0027t that they thought it was bad. They didn\u0027t think it was anything.\n But all the right ingredients were there, weren\u0027t they? Tradition was full of people giving evil rulers a well-justified seeing to. Witches were always a draw. The apparition of Death was particularly good, with some lovely lines. Mix them all together . . . and they seemed to cancel out, become a mere humdrum way of filling the stage for a couple of hours.\n Late at night, when the cast was alseep, Hwel would sit up in one of the carts and feverishly rewrite. He rearranged scenes, cut lines, added lines, introduced a clown, included another fight, and tuned up the special effects. It didn\u0027t seem to have any effect. The play was like some marvellous intricate painting, a feast of impressions close to, a mere blur from the distance.\n When the inspirations were sleeting fast he even tried changing the style. In the morning the early risers grew accustomed to finding discarded experiments decorating the grass around the carts, like extremely literate mushrooms.\n Tomjon kept one of the strangest:\n 1ST WITCHE: He\u0027s late.\n (Pause)\n 2ND WITCHE: He said he would come.\n (Pause)\n 3RD WITCHE: He said he would come but he hasn\u0027t. This is my last newt. I saved it for him. And he hasn\u0027t come.\n (Pause)\n \u0027I think,\u0027 said Tomjon, later, \u0027you ought to slow down a bit. You\u0027ve done what was ordered. No-one said it had to sparkle.\u0027\n \u0027It could, you know. If I could just get it right.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re absolutely sure about the ghost, are you?\u0027 said Tomjon. The way he threw the line away made it clear that he wasn\u0027t.\n \u0027There\u0027s nothing wrong with the ghost,\u0027 snapped Hwel. \u0027The scene with the ghost is the best I\u0027ve done.\u0027\n \u0027I was just wondering if this is the right play for it, that\u0027s all.\u0027\n \u0027The ghost stays. Now let\u0027s get on, boy.\u0027\n Two days later, with the Ramtops a blue and white wall that was beginning to dominate the Hubward horizon, the company was attacked. There wasn\u0027t much drama; they had just manhandled the lattys across a ford and were resting in the shade of a grove of trees, which suddenly fruited robbers.\n Hwel looked along the line of half a dozen stained and rusty blades. Their owners seemed slightly uncertain about what to do next.\n \u0027We\u0027ve got a receipt somewhere—\u0027 he began.\n Tomjon nudged him. \u0027These don\u0027t look like Guild thieves,\u0027 he hissed. \u0027They definitely look freelance to me.\u0027\n It would be nice to say that the leader of the robbers was a black-bearded, swaggering brute, with a red headscarf and one gold earring and a chin you could clean pots with. Actually it would be practically compulsory. And, in fact, this was so. Hwel thought the wooden leg was overdoing it, but the man had obviously studied the role.\n \u0027Well now,\u0027 said the bandit chief. \u0027What have we here, and do they have any money?\u0027\n \u0027We\u0027re actors,\u0027 said Tomjon.\n \u0027That ought to answer both questions,\u0027 said Hwel.\n \u0027And none of your repartee,\u0027 said the bandit. \u0027I\u0027ve been to the city, I have. I know repartee when I see it and—\u0027 he half turned to his followers, raising an eyebrow to indicate that the next remark was going to be witty – \u0027if you\u0027re not careful I can make a few cutting remarks of my own.\u0027\n There was dead silence behind him until he made an impatient gesture with his cutlass.\n \u0027All right,\u0027 he said, against a chorus of uncertain laughter. \u0027We\u0027ll just take any loose change, valuables, food and clothing you might be having.\u0027\n \u0027Could I say something?\u0027 said Tomjon.\n The company backed away from him. Hwel smiled at his own feet.\n \u0027You\u0027re going to beg for mercy, are you?\u0027 said the bandit.\n \u0027That\u0027s right.\u0027\n Hwel thrust his hands deep into his pockets and looked up at the sky, whistling under his breath and trying not to break into a maniac grin. He was aware that the other actors were also looking expectantly at Tomjon.\n He\u0027s going to give them the mercy speech from The Troll\u0027s Tale, he thought . . .\n \u0027The point I\u0027d just like to make is that—\u0027 said Tomjon, and his stance changed subtly, his voice became deeper, his right hand flung out dramatically – \u0027 “The worth of man lies not in feats of arms, Or the fiery hunger o\u0027 the ravening—” \u0027\n It\u0027s going to be like when that man tried to rob us back in Sto Lat, Hwel thought. If they end up giving us their swords, what the hell can we do with them? And it\u0027s so embarrassing when they start crying.\n It was at this moment that the world around him took a green tint and he thought he could make out, right on the cusp of hearing, other voices.\n \u0027There\u0027s men with swords, Granny!\u0027\n \u0027—rend with glowing blades the marvel of the world—\u0027 Tomjon said, and the voices at the edge of imagination said. \u0027No king of mine is going to beg anything off anyone. Give me that milk jug, Magrat.\u0027\n \u0027—the heart of compassion, the kiss—\u0027\n \u0027That was a present from my aunt.\u0027\n \u0027—this jewel of jewels, this crown of crowns.\u0027\n There was silence. One or two of the bandits were weeping silently into their hands.\n Their chief said, \u0027Is that it?\u0027\n For the first time in his life Tomjon looked nonplussed.\n \u0027Well, yes,\u0027 he said. \u0027Er. Would you like me to repeat it?\u0027\n \u0027It was a good speech,\u0027 the bandit conceded. \u0027But I don\u0027t see what it\u0027s got to do with me. I\u0027m a practical man. Hand over your valuables.\u0027\n His sword came up until it was level with Tomjon\u0027s throat.\n \u0027And all the rest of you shouldn\u0027t be standing there like idiots,\u0027 he added. \u0027Come on. Or the boy gets it.\u0027\n Wimsloe the apprentice raised a cautious hand.\n \u0027What?\u0027 said the bandit.\n \u0027A-are you s-sure you listened carefully, sir?\u0027\n \u0027I won\u0027t tell you again! Either I hear the clink of coins, or you hear a gurgle!\u0027\n In fact what they all heard was a whistling noise, high in the air, and the crash as a milk jug, its sides frosted with the ice of altitude, dropped out of the sky on to the spike atop the chief\u0027s helmet.\n The remaining bandits took one look at the results, and fled.\n The actors stared down at the recumbent bandit. Hwel prodded a lump of frozen milk with his boot.\n \u0027Well, well,\u0027 he said weakly.\n \u0027He didn\u0027t take any notice!\u0027 whispered Tomjon.\n \u0027A born critic,\u0027 said the dwarf. It was a blue and white jug. Funny how little details stood out at a time like this. It had been smashed several times in the past, he could see, because the pieces had been carefully glued together again. Someone had really loved that jug.\n \u0027What we\u0027re dealing with here,\u0027 he said, rallying some shreds of logic, \u0027is a freak whirlwind. Obviously.\u0027\n \u0027But milk jugs don\u0027t just drop out of the sky,\u0027 said Tomjon, demonstrating the astonishing human art of denying the obvious.\n \u0027I don\u0027t know about that. I\u0027ve heard of fish and frogs and rocks,\u0027 said Hwel. \u0027There\u0027s nothing against crockery.\u0027 He began to rally. \u0027It\u0027s just one of these uncommon phenomenons.\n They happen all the time in this part of the world, there\u0027s nothing unusual about it.\u0027\n They got back on to the carts and rode on in unaccustomed silence. Young Wimsloe collected every bit of jug he could find and stored them carefully in the props box, and spent the rest of the day watching the sky, hoping for a sugar basin.\n The lattys toiled up the dusty slopes of the Ramtops, mere motes in the foggy glass of the crystal.\n \u0027Are they all right?\u0027 said Magrat.\n They\u0027re wandering all over the place,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027They may be good at the acting, but they\u0027ve got something to learn about the travelling.\u0027\n \u0027It was a nice jug,\u0027 said Magrat. \u0027You can\u0027t get them like that any more. I mean, if you\u0027d have said what was on your mind, there was a flatiron on the shelf.\u0027\n \u0027There\u0027s more to life than milk jugs.\u0027\n \u0027It had a daisy pattern round the top.\u0027\n Granny ignored her.\n \u0027I think,\u0027 she said, \u0027it\u0027s time we had a look at this new king. Close up.\u0027 She cackled.\n \u0027You cackled, Granny,\u0027 said Magrat darkly.\n \u0027I did not! It was,\u0027 Granny fumbled for a word, \u0027a chuckle.\u0027\n \u0027I bet Black Aliss used to cackle.\u0027\n \u0027You want to watch out you don\u0027t end up the same way as she did,\u0027 said Nanny, from her seat by the fire. \u0027She went a bit funny at the finish, you know. Poisoned apples and suchlike.\u0027\n \u0027Just because I might have chuckled a . . . a bit roughly,\u0027 sniffed Granny. She felt that she was being unduly defensive. \u0027Anyway, there\u0027s nothing wrong with cackling. In moderation.\u0027\n \u0027I think,\u0027 said Tomjon, \u0027that we\u0027re lost.\u0027\n Hwel looked at the baking purple moorland around them, which stretched up to the towering spires of the Ramtops themselves. Even in the height of summer there were pennants of snow flying from the highest peaks. It was a landscape of describable beauty.\n Bees were busy, or at least endeavouring to look and sound busy, in the thyme by the trackside. Cloud shadows flickered over the alpine meadows. There was the kind of big, empty silence made by an environment that not only doesn\u0027t have any people in it, but doesn\u0027t need them either.\n Or signposts.\n \u0027We were lost ten miles ago,\u0027 said Hwel. \u0027There\u0027s got to be a new word for what we are now.\u0027\n \u0027You said the mountains were honeycombed with dwarf mines,\u0027 said Tomjon. \u0027You said a dwarf could tell wherever he was in the mountains.\u0027\n \u0027Underground, I said. It\u0027s all a matter of strata and rock formations. Not on the surface. All the landscape gets in the way.\u0027\n \u0027We could dig you a hole,\u0027 said Tomjon.\n But it was a nice day and, as the road meandered through clumps of hemlock and pine, outposts of the forest, it was pleasant enough to let the mules go at their own pace. The road, Hwel felt, had to go somewhere.\n This geographical fiction has been the death of many people. Roads don\u0027t necessarily have to go anywhere, they just have to have somewhere to start.\n \u0027We are lost, aren\u0027t we?\u0027 said Tomjon, after a while.\n \u0027Certainly not.\u0027\n \u0027Where are we, then?\u0027\n \u0027The mountains. Perfectly clear on any atlas.\u0027\n \u0027We ought to stop and ask someone.\u0027\n Tomjon gazed around at the rolling countryside. Somewhere a lonely curlew howled, or possibly it was a badger – Hwel was a little hazy about rural matters, at least those that took place higher than about the limestone layer. There wasn\u0027t another human being within miles.\n \u0027Who did you have in mind?\u0027 he said sarcastically.\n \u0027That old woman in the funny hat,\u0027 said Tomjon, pointing. \u0027I\u0027ve been watching her. She keeps ducking down behind a bush when she thinks I\u0027ve seen her.\u0027\n Hwel turned and looked down at a bramble bush, which wobbled.\n \u0027Ho there, good mother,\u0027 he said.\n The bush sprouted an indignant head.\n \u0027Whose mother?\u0027 it said.\n Hwel hesitated. \u0027Just a figure of speech, Mrs . . . Miss . . .\u0027\n \u0027Mistress,\u0027 snapped Granny Weatherwax. \u0027And I\u0027m a poor old woman gathering wood,\u0027 she added defiantly.\n She cleared her throat. \u0027Lawks,\u0027 she went on. \u0027You did give me a fright, young master. My poor old heart.\u0027\n There was silence from the carts. Then Tomjon said, \u0027I\u0027m sorry?\u0027\n \u0027What?\u0027 said Granny.\n \u0027Your poor old heart what?\u0027\n \u0027What about my poor old heart?\u0027 said Granny, who wasn\u0027t used to acting like an old woman and had a very limited repertoire in this area. But it\u0027s traditional that young heirs seeking their destiny get help from mysterious old women gathering wood, and she wasn\u0027t about to buck tradition.\n \u0027It\u0027s just that you mentioned it,\u0027 said Hwel.\n \u0027Well, it isn\u0027t important. Lawks. I expect you\u0027re looking for Lancre,\u0027 said Granny testily, in a hurry to get to the point. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wyrd-sisters-discworld-6/page-32.html","bookId":1625,"book":{"id":1625,"title":"Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6)","description":"Storyline: \n Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6) \n Witches are not by nature gregarious, and they certainly don\u0027t have leaders.
