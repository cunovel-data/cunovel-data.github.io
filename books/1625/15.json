{"id":95580,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"\u0027Whoops,\u0027 he said, and turned to run for it. \u0027Don\u0027t—\u0027 Magrat began, but the Fool was already pounding down the forest path that led back to the castle. Magrat stood and stared at the wilting posy in her hands. She ran her fingers through her hair and a shower of wilted petals fell out. She felt that an important moment had been allowed to slip out of her grasp as fast as a greased pig in a narrow passageway. She felt an overpowering urge to curse. She knew a great many curses. Goodie Whemper had been really imaginative in that department; even the creatures of the forest used to go past her cottage at a dead run. She couldn\u0027t find a single one that fully expressed her feelings. \u0027Oh, bugger,\u0027 she said. It was a full moon again that night, and most unusually all three witches arrived at the standing stone early; it was so embarrassed by this that it went and hid in some gorse bushes. \u0027Greebo hasn\u0027t been home for two days/ said Nanny Ogg, as soon as she arrived. \u0027It\u0027s not like him. I can\u0027t find him anywhere.\u0027 \u0027Cats can look after themselves,\u0027 said Granny Weatherwax. \u0027Countries can\u0027t. I have intelligence to report. Light the fire, Magrat.\u0027 \u0027Mmm?\u0027 \u0027I said, light the fire, Magrat.\u0027 \u0027Mmm? Oh. Yes.\u0027 The two old women watched her drift vaguely across the moorland, tugging absently at dried-up whin clumps. Magrat seemed to have her mind on something. \u0027Doesn\u0027t seem to be her normal self,\u0027 said Nanny Ogg. \u0027Yes. Could be an improvement,\u0027 said Granny shortly, and sat down on a rock. \u0027She should of got it lit before we arrived. It\u0027s her job.\u0027 \u0027She means well,\u0027 said Nanny Ogg, studying Magrat\u0027s back reflectively. \u0027I used to mean well when I was a girl, but that didn\u0027t stop the sharp end of Goodie Filter\u0027s tongue. Youngest witch serves her time, you know how it is. We had it tougher, too. Look at her. Doesn\u0027t even wear the pointy hat. How\u0027s anyone going to know?\u0027 \u0027You got something on your mind, Esme?\u0027 said Nanny. Granny nodded gloomily. \u0027Had a visit yesterday,\u0027 she said. \u0027Me too.\u0027 Despite her worries, Granny was slightly annoyed at this. \u0027Who from?\u0027 she said. \u0027The mayor of Lancre and a bunch of burghers. They\u0027re not happy about the king. They want a king they can trust.\u0027 \u0027I wouldn\u0027t trust any king a burgher could trust,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027Yes, but it\u0027s not good for anyone, all this taxing and killing folk. The new sergeant they\u0027ve got is a keen man when it comes to setting fire to cottages, too. Old Verence used to do it too, mind, but . . . well . . .\u0027 \u0027I know, I know. It was more personal,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027You felt he meant it. People like to feel they\u0027re valued.\u0027 \u0027This Felmet hates the kingdom,\u0027 Nanny went on. \u0027They all say it. They say when they go to talk to him he just stares at them and giggles and rubs his hand and twitches a bit.\u0027 Granny scratched her chin. \u0027The old king used to shout at them and kick them out of the castle, mind. He used to say he didn\u0027t have no time for shopkeepers and such,\u0027 she added, with a note of personal approval. \u0027But he was always very gracious about it,\u0027 said Nanny Ogg. \u0027And he—\u0027 \u0027The kingdom is worried,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027Yes, I already said.\u0027 \u0027I didn\u0027t mean the people, I meant the kingdom.\u0027 Granny explained. Nanny interrupted a few times with brief questions. It didn\u0027t occur to her to doubt anything she heard. Granny Weatherwax never made things up. At the end of it she said, \u0027Well.\u0027 \u0027My feelings exactly.\u0027 \u0027Fancy that.\u0027 \u0027Quite so.\u0027 \u0027And what did the animals do then?\u0027 \u0027Went away. It had brought them there, it let them go.\u0027 \u0027No one et anyone else?\u0027 \u0027Not where I saw.\u0027 \u0027Funny thing.\u0027 \u0027Right enough.\u0027 Nanny Ogg stared at the setting sun. \u0027I don\u0027t reckon a lot of kingdoms do that sort of thing,\u0027 she said. \u0027You saw the theatre. Kings and such are killing one another the whole time. Their kingdoms just make the best of it. How come this one takes offence all of a sudden?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s been here a long time,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027So\u0027s everywhere,\u0027 said Nanny, and added, with the air of a lifetime student, \u0027Everywhere\u0027s been where it is ever since it was first put there. It\u0027s called geography.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s just about land,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027It\u0027s not the same as a kingdom. A kingdom is made up of-all sorts of things. Ideas. Loyalties. Memories, It all sort of exists together. And then all these things create some kind of life. Not a body kind of life, more like a living idea. Made up of everything that\u0027s alive and what they\u0027re thinking. And what the people before them thought.\u0027 Magrat reappeared and began to lay the fire with the air of one in a trance. \u0027I can see you\u0027ve been thinking about this a lot,\u0027 said Nanny, speaking very slowly and carefully. \u0027And this kingdom wants a better king, is that it?\u0027 \u0027No! That is, yes. Look—\u0027 she leaned forward – \u0027it doesn\u0027t have the same kind of likes and dislikes as people, right?\u0027 Nanny Ogg leaned back. \u0027Well, it wouldn\u0027t, would it,\u0027 she ventured. \u0027It doesn\u0027t care if people are good or bad. I don\u0027t think it could even tell, any more than you could tell if an ant was a good ant. But it expects the king to care for it.\u0027 \u0027Yes, but,\u0027 said Nanny wretchedly. She was becoming a bit afraid of the gleam in Granny\u0027s eye. \u0027Lots of people have killed each other to become king of Lancre. They\u0027ve done all kinds of murder.\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t matter! Don\u0027t matter!\u0027 said Granny, waving her arms. She started counting on her fingers. \u0027For why,\u0027 she said. \u0027One, kings go round killing each other because it\u0027s all part of destiny and such and doesn\u0027t count as murder, and two, they killed for the kingdom. That\u0027s the important bit. But this new man just wants the power. He hates the kingdom.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s a bit like a dog, really,\u0027 said Magrat. Granny looked at her with her mouth open to frame some suitable retort, and then her face softened. \u0027Very much like,\u0027 she said. \u0027A dog doesn\u0027t care if its master\u0027s good or bad, just so long as it likes the dog.\u0027 \u0027Well, then,\u0027 said Nanny. \u0027No-one and nothing likes Felmet. What are we going to do about it?\u0027 \u0027Nothing. You know we can\u0027t meddle.\u0027 \u0027You saved that baby,\u0027 said Nanny. \u0027That\u0027s not meddling!\u0027 \u0027Have it your way,\u0027 said Nanny. \u0027But maybe one day he\u0027ll come back. Destiny again. And you said we should hide the crown. It\u0027ll all come back, mark my words. Hurry up with that tea, Magrat.\u0027 \u0027What are you going to do about the burghers?\u0027 said Granny. \u0027I told them they\u0027ll have to sort it out themselves. Once we use magic, I said, it\u0027d never stop. You know that.\u0027 \u0027Right,\u0027 said Granny, but there was a hint of wistfulness in her voice. \u0027I\u0027ll tell you this, though,\u0027 said Nanny. \u0027They didn\u0027t like it much. They was muttering when they left.\u0027 Magrat blurted out, \u0027You know the Fool, who lives up at the castle?\u0027 \u0027Little man with runny eyes?\u0027 said Nanny, relieved that the conversation had returned to more normal matters. \u0027Not that little,\u0027 said Magrat. \u0027What\u0027s his name, do you happen to know?\u0027 \u0027He\u0027s just called Fool,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027No job for a man, that. Running around with bells on.\u0027 \u0027His mother was a Beldame, from over Blackglass way,\u0027 said Nanny Ogg, whose knowledge of the genealogy of Lancre was legendary. \u0027Bit of a beauty when she was younger. Broke many a heart, she did. Bit of a scandal there, I did hear. Granny\u0027s right, though. At the end of the day, a Fool\u0027s a Fool.\u0027 \u0027Why d\u0027you want to know, Magrat?\u0027 said Granny Weather-wax. \u0027Oh . . . one of the girls in the village was asking me,\u0027 said Magrat, crimson to the ears. Nanny cleared her throat, and grinned at Granny Weatherwax, who sniffed aloofly. \u0027It\u0027s a steady job,\u0027 said Nanny. \u0027I\u0027ll grant you that.\u0027 \u0027Huh,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027A man who tinkles all day. No kind of husband for anyone, I\u0027d say.\u0027 \u0027You – she\u0027d always know where he was,\u0027 said Nanny, who was enjoying this. \u0027You\u0027d just have to listen.\u0027 \u0027Never trust a man with horns on his hat,\u0027 said Granny flatly. Magrat stood up and pulled herself together, giving the impression that some bits had to come quite a long way. \u0027You\u0027re a pair of silly old women,\u0027 she said quietly. \u0027And I\u0027m going home.\u0027 She marched off down the path to her village without another word. The old witches stared at one another. \u0027Well!\u0027 said Nanny. \u0027It\u0027s all these books they read today,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027It overheats the brain. You haven\u0027t been putting ideas in her head, have you?\u0027 \u0027What do you mean?\u0027 \u0027You know what I mean.\u0027 Nanny stood up. \u0027I certainly don\u0027t see why a girl should have to be single her whole life just because you think it\u0027s the right thing,\u0027 she said. \u0027Anyway, if people didn\u0027t have children, where would we be?\u0027 \u0027None of your girls is a witch,\u0027 said Granny, also standing up. \u0027They could have been,\u0027 said Nanny defensively. \u0027Yes, if you\u0027d let them work it out for themselves, instead of encouragin\u0027 them to throw themselves at men.\u0027 \u0027They\u0027re good-lookin\u0027. You can\u0027t stand in the way of human nature. You\u0027d know that if you\u0027d ever—\u0027 \u0027If I\u0027d ever what?\u0027 said Granny Weatherwax, quietly. They stared at one another in shocked silence. They could both feel it, the tension creeping into their bodies from the ground itself, the hot, aching feeling that they\u0027d started something they must finish, no matter what. \u0027I knew you when you were a gel,\u0027 said Nanny sullenly. \u0027Stuck-up, you were.\u0027 \u0027At least I spent most of the time upright,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027Disgustin\u0027, that was. Everyone thought so.\u0027 \u0027How would you know?\u0027 snapped Nanny. \u0027You were the talk of the whole village,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027And you were, too! They called you the Ice Maiden. Never knew that, did you?\u0027 sneered Nanny. \u0027I wouldn\u0027t sully my lips by sayin\u0027 what they called you,\u0027 shouted Granny. \u0027Oh yes?\u0027 shrieked Nanny. \u0027Well, let me tell you, my good woman—\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t you dare talk to me in that tone of voice! I\u0027m not anyone\u0027s good woman—\u0027 \u0027Right!\u0027 There was another silence while they stared at one another, nose to nose, but this silence was a whole quantum level of animosity higher than the last one; you could have roasted a turkey in the heat of this silence. There was no more shouting. Things had got far too bad for shouting. Now the voices came in low and full of menace. \u0027I should have known better than to listen to Magrat,\u0027 growled Granny. \u0027This coven business is ridiculous. It attracts entirely the wrong sort of people.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m very glad we had this little talk,\u0027 hissed Nanny Ogg. \u0027Cleared the air.\u0027 She looked down. \u0027And you\u0027re in my territory, madam.\u0027 \u0027Madam!\u0027 Thunder rolled in the distance. The permanent Lancre storm, after a trip through the foothills, had drifted back towards the mountains for a one-night stand. The last rays of sunset shone livid through the clouds, and fat drops of water began to thud on the witches\u0027 pointed hats. \u0027I really don\u0027t have time for all this,\u0027 snapped Granny, trembling. \u0027I have far more important things to do.\u0027 \u0027And me,\u0027 said Nanny. \u0027Good night to you.\u0027 \u0027And you.\u0027 They turned their backs on one another and strode away into the downpour. The midnight rain drummed on Magrat\u0027s curtained windows as she thumbed her way purposefully through Goodie Whemper\u0027s books of what, for want of any better word, could be called natural magic. The old woman had been a great collector of such things and, most unusually, had written them down; witches didn\u0027t normally have much use for literacy. But book after book was filled with tiny, meticulous handwriting detailing the results of patient experiments in applied magic. Goodie Whemper had, in fact, been a research witch.[10]","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wyrd-sisters-discworld-6/page-15.html","bookId":1625,"book":{"id":1625,"title":"Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6)","description":"Storyline: Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6) Witches are not by nature gregarious, and they certainly don\u0027t have leaders.
