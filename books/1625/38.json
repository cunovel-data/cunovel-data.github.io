It wasn\u0027t me.\u0027 He looked up at the duchess, towering over him now like a red tsunami over a small fishing village.\n \u0027It was her,\u0027 he said. \u0027She did it.\u0027\n He stabbed her once or twice, on general principles, and then stabbed himself and let the dagger drop from his fingers.\n After a few seconds reflection he said, in a voice far nearer the worlds of sanity, \u0027You can\u0027t get me now.\u0027\n He turned to Death. \u0027Will there be a comet?\u0027 he said. \u0027There must be a comet when a prince dies. I\u0027ll go and see, shall I?\u0027\n He wandered away. The audience broke into applause.\n \u0027You\u0027ve got to admit he was real royalty,\u0027 said Nanny Ogg, eventually. \u0027It only goes to show, royalty goes eccentric far better than the likes of you and me.\u0027\n Death held the hourglass to his skull, his face radiating puzzlement.\n Granny Weatherwax picked up the fallen dagger and tested the blade with her finger. It slid into the handle quite easily, with a faint squeaking noise.\n She passed it to Nanny.\n \u0027There\u0027s your magic sword,\u0027 she said.\n Magrat looked at it, and then back at the Fool.\n \u0027Are you dead or not?\u0027 she said.\n \u0027I must be,\u0027 said the Fool, his voice slightly muffled. \u0027I think I\u0027m in paradise.\u0027\n \u0027No, look, I\u0027m serious.\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t know. But I\u0027d like to breathe.\u0027\n \u0027Then you must be alive.\u0027\n \u0027Everyone\u0027s alive,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027It\u0027s a trick dagger. Actors probably can\u0027t be trusted with real ones.\u0027\n \u0027After all, they can\u0027t even keep a cauldron clean,\u0027 said Nanny.\n \u0027Whether everyone is alive or not is a matter for me,\u0027 said the duchess. \u0027As ruler it is my pleasure to decide. Clearly my husband has lost his wits.\u0027 She turned to her soldiers. \u0027And I decree—\u0027\n \u0027Now!\u0027 hissed King Verence in Granny\u0027s ear. \u0027Now!\u0027\n Granny Weatherwax drew herself up.\n \u0027Be silent, woman!\u0027 she said. \u0027The true King of Lancre stands before you!\u0027\n She clapped Tomjon on the shoulder.\n \u0027What, him?\u0027\n \u0027Who, me?\u0027\n \u0027Ridiculous,\u0027 said the duchess. \u0027He\u0027s a mummer, of sorts.\u0027\n \u0027She\u0027s right, miss,\u0027 said Tomjon, on the edge of panic. \u0027My father runs a theatre, not a kingdom.\u0027\n \u0027He is the true king. We can prove it,\u0027 said Granny.\n \u0027Oh, no,\u0027 said the duchess. \u0027We\u0027re not having that. There\u0027s no mysterious returned heirs in this kingdom. Guards – take him.\u0027\n Granny Weatherwax held up a hand. The soldiers lurched from foot to foot, uncertainly.\n \u0027She\u0027s a witch, isn\u0027t she?\u0027 said one of them, tentatively.\n \u0027Certainly,\u0027 said the duchess.\n The guards shifted uneasily.\n \u0027We seen where they turn people into newts,\u0027 said one.\n \u0027And then shipwreck them.\u0027\n \u0027Yeah, and alarum the divers.\u0027\n \u0027Yeah.\u0027\n \u0027We ought to talk about this. We ought to get extra for witches.\u0027\n \u0027She could do anything to us, look. She could be a drabe, even.\u0027\n \u0027Don\u0027t be foolish,\u0027 said the duchess. \u0027Witches don\u0027t do that sort of thing. They\u0027re just stories to frighten people.\u0027\n The guard shook his head.\n \u0027It looked pretty convincing to me.\u0027\n \u0027Of course it did, it was meant—\u0027 the duchess began.\n She sighed, and snatched a spear out of the guard\u0027s hand.\n \u0027I\u0027ll show you the power of these witches,\u0027 she said, and hurled it at Granny\u0027s face.\n Granny moved her hand across at snakebite speed and caught the spear just behind the head.\n \u0027So,\u0027 she said, \u0027and it comes to this, does it?\u0027\n \u0027You don\u0027t frighten me, wyrd sisters,\u0027 said the duchess.\n Granny stared her in the eye for a few seconds. She gave a grunt of surprise.\n \u0027You\u0027re right,\u0027 she said. \u0027We really don\u0027t, do we . . .\u0027\n \u0027Do you think I haven\u0027t studied you? Your witchcraft is all artifice and illusion, to amaze weak minds. It holds no fears for me. Do your worst.\u0027\n Granny studied her for a while.\n \u0027My worst?\u0027 she said, eventually. Magrat and Nanny Ogg shuffled gently out of her way.\n The duchess laughed.\n \u0027You\u0027re clever,\u0027 she said. \u0027I\u0027ll grant you that much. And quick. Come on, hag. Bring on your toads and demons, I\u0027ll . . .\u0027\n She stopped, her mouth opening and shutting a bit without any words emerging. Her lips drew back in a rictus of terror, her eyes looked beyond Granny, beyond the world, towards something else. One knuckled hand flew to her mouth and she made a little whimpering noise. She froze, like a rabbit that has just seen a stoat and knows, without any doubt, that it is the last stoat that it will ever see.\n \u0027What have you done to her?\u0027 said Magrat, the first to dare to speak. Granny smirked.\n \u0027Headology,\u0027 said Granny, and smirked. \u0027You don\u0027t need any Black Aliss magic for it.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, but what have you done?\u0027\n \u0027No-one becomes like she is without building walls inside their head,\u0027 she said. Tve just knocked them down. Every scream. Every plea. Every pang of guilt. Every twinge of conscience. All at once. There\u0027s a little trick to it.\u0027\n She gave Magrat a condescending smile. \u0027I\u0027ll show you one day, if you like.\u0027\n Magrat thought about it. \u0027It\u0027s horrible,\u0027 she said.\n \u0027Nonsense,\u0027 Granny smiled terribly. \u0027Everyone wants to know their true self. Now, she does.\u0027\n \u0027Sometimes you have to be kind to be cruel,\u0027 said Nanny Ogg approvingly.\n \u0027I think it\u0027s probably the worst thing that could happen to anyone,\u0027 said Magrat, as the duchess swayed backwards and forwards.\n \u0027For goodness\u0027 sake use your imagination, girl,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027There are far worse things. Needles under the fingernails, for one. Stuff with pliers.\u0027\n \u0027Red-hot knives up the jacksie,\u0027 said Nanny Ogg. \u0027Handle first, too, so you cut your fingers trying to pull them out—\u0027\n \u0027This is simply the worst that I can do,\u0027 said Granny Weatherwax primly. \u0027It\u0027s all right and proper, too. A witch should act like that, you know. There\u0027s no need for any dramatic stuff. Most magic goes on in the head. It\u0027s headology. Now, if you\u0027d—\u0027\n A noise like a gas leak escaped from the duchess\u0027s lips. Her head jerked back suddenly. She opened her eyes, blinked, and focused on Granny. Sheer hatred suffused her features.\n \u0027Guards!\u0027 she said. \u0027I told you to take them!\u0027\n Granny\u0027s jaw sagged. \u0027What?\u0027 she said. \u0027But – but I showed you your true self . . .\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m supposed to be upset by that, am I?\u0027 As the soldiers sheepishly grabbed Granny\u0027s arms the duchess pressed her face close to Granny\u0027s, her tremendous eyebrows a V of triumphant hatred. \u0027I\u0027m supposed to grovel on the floor, is that it? Well, old woman, I\u0027ve seen exactly what I am, do you understand, and I\u0027m proud of it! I\u0027d do it all again, only hotter and longer! I enjoyed it, and I did it because I wanted to!\u0027\n She thumped the vast expanse of her chest.\n \u0027You gawping idiots!\u0027 she said. \u0027You\u0027re so weak. You really think that people are basically decent underneath, don\u0027t you?\u0027\n The crowd on the stage backed away from the sheer force of her exultation.\n \u0027Well, I\u0027ve looked underneath,\u0027 said the duchess. \u0027I know what drives people. It\u0027s fear. Sheer, deep-down fear. There\u0027s not one of you who doesn\u0027t fear me, I can make you widdle your drawers out of terror, and now I\u0027m going to take—\u0027\n At this point Nanny Ogg hit her on the back of the head with the cauldron.\n \u0027She does go on, doesn\u0027t she?\u0027 she said conversationally, as the duchess collapsed. \u0027She was a bit eccentric, if you ask me.\u0027\n There was a long, embarrassed silence.\n Granny Weatherwax coughed. Then she treated the soldiers holding her to a bright, friendly smile, and pointed to the mound that was now the duchess.\n \u0027Take her away and put her in a cell somewhere,\u0027 she commanded. The men snapped to attention, grabbed the duchess by her arms, and pulled her upright with considerable difficulty.\n \u0027Gently, mind,\u0027 said Granny.\n She rubbed her hands together and turned to Tomjon, who was watching her with his mouth open.\n \u0027Depend on it,\u0027 she hissed. \u0027Here and now, my lad, you don\u0027t have a choice. You\u0027re the King of Lancre.\u0027\n \u0027But I don\u0027t know how to be a king!\u0027\n \u0027We all seed you! You had it down just right, including the shouting.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s just acting!\u0027\n \u0027Act, then. Being a king is, is—\u0027 Granny hesitated, and snapped her fingers at Magrat. \u0027What do you call them things, there\u0027s always a hundred of them in anything?\u0027\n Magrat looked bewildered. \u0027Do you mean per cents?\u0027 she said.\n \u0027Them,\u0027 agreed Granny. \u0027Most of the per cents in being a king is acting, if you ask me. You ought to be good at it.\u0027\n Tomjon looked for help into the wings, where Hwel should have been. The dwarf was in fact there, but he wasn\u0027t paying much attention. He had the script in front of him, and was rewriting furiously.\n BUT I ASSURE YOU, YOU ARE NOT DEAD. TAKE IT FROM ME.\n The duke giggled. He had found a sheet from somewhere and had draped it over himself, and was sidling along some of the castle\u0027s more deserted corridors. Sometimes he would go \u0027whoo-oo\u0027 in a low voice.\n This worried Death. He was used to people claiming that they were not dead, because death always came as a shock, and a lot of people had some trouble getting over it. But people claiming that they were dead with every breath in their body was a new and unsettling experience.\n \u0027I shall jump out on people,\u0027 said the duke dreamily. \u0027I shall rattle my bones all night, I shall perch on the roof and foretell a death in the house—\u0027\n THAT\u0027S BANSHEES.\n \u0027I shall if I want,\u0027 said the duke, with a trace of earlier determination. \u0027And I shall float through walls, and knock on tables, and drip ectoplasm on anyone I don\u0027t like. Ha. Ha.\u0027\n IT WON\u0027T WORK. LIVING PEOPLE ARENT ALLOWED TO BE GHOSTS. I\u0027M SORRY.\n The duke made an unsuccessful attempt to float through a wall, gave up, and opened a door out on to a crumbling section of the battlements. The storm had died away a bit, and a thin rind of moon lurked behind the clouds like a ticket tout for eternity.\n Death stalked through the wall behind him.\n \u0027Well then,\u0027 said the duke, \u0027if I\u0027m not dead, why are you here?\u0027\n He jumped up on to the wall and flapped his sheet.\n WAITING.\n \u0027Wait forever, bone face!\u0027 said the duke triumphantly. \u0027I shall hover in the twilight world, I shall find some chains to shake, I shall—\u0027\n He stepped backwards, lost his balance, landed heavily on the wall and slid. For a moment the remnant of his right hand scrabbled ineffectually at the stonework, and then it vanished.\n Death is obviously potentially everywhere at the same time, and in one sense it is no more true to say that he was on the battlements, picking vaguely at non-existent particles of glowing metal on the edge of his scythe blade, than that he was waist-deep in the foaming, rock-toothed waters in the depths of Lancre gorge, his calcareous gaze sweeping downwards and stopping abruptly at a point where the torrent ran a few treacherous inches over a bed of angular pebbles.\n After a while the duke sat up, transparent in the phosphorescent waves.\n \u0027I shall haunt their corridors,\u0027 he said, \u0027and whisper under the doors on still nights.\u0027 His voice grew fainter, almost lost in the ceaseless roar of the river. \u0027I shall make basket chairs creak most alarmingly, just you wait and see.\u0027\n Death grinned at him.\n NOW YOU\u0027RE TALKING.\n It started to rain.\n Ramtop rain has a curiously penetrative quality which makes ordinary rain seem almost arid. It poured in torrents over the castle roofs, and somehow seemed to go right through the tiles and fill the Great Hall with a warm, uncomfortable moistness.[21]\n The hall was crowded with half the population of Lancre. Outside, the rushing of the rain even drowned out the distant roar of the river. It soaked the stage. The colours ran and mingled in the painted backdrop, and one of the curtains sagged away from its rail and flapped sadly into a puddle. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wyrd-sisters-discworld-6/page-38.html","bookId":1625,"book":{"id":1625,"title":"Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6)","description":"Storyline: \n Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6) \n Witches are not by nature gregarious, and they certainly don\u0027t have leaders.
