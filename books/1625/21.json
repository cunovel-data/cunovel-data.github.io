{"id":95586,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"Thought I\u0027d forgotten it, for a minute there,\u0027 she said, lifting it out. \u0027You can come out now.\u0027\n He was barely visible in the brightness of day, a mere shimmer in the air under the trees. King Verence blinked. He wasn\u0027t used to daylight.\n \u0027Esme,\u0027 said Nanny. \u0027There\u0027s someone to see you.\u0027\n Granny turned slowly and squinted at the ghost.\n \u0027I saw you in the dungeon, didn\u0027t I?\u0027 she said. \u0027Who\u0027re you?\u0027\n \u0027Verence, King of Lancre,\u0027 said the ghost, and bowed. \u0027Do I have the honour of addressing Granny Weatherwax, doyenne of witches?\u0027\n It has already been pointed out that just because Verence came from a long line of kings didn\u0027t mean that he was basically stupid, and a year without the distractions of the flesh had done wonders as well. Granny Weatherwax considered herself totally unsusceptible to buttering up, but the king was expertly applying the equivalent of the dairy surplus of quite a large country. Bowing was a particularly good touch.\n A muscle twitched at the corner of Granny\u0027s mouth. She gave a stiff little bow in return, because she wasn\u0027t quite sure what \u0027doyenne\u0027 meant.\n \u0027I\u0027m her,\u0027 she conceded.\n \u0027You can get up now,\u0027 she added, regally.\n King Verence remained kneeling, about two inches above the actual ground.\n \u0027I crave a boon,\u0027 he said urgently.\n \u0027Here, how did you get out of the castle?\u0027 said Granny.\n \u0027The esteemed Nanny Ogg assisted me,\u0027 said the king. \u0027I reasoned, if I am anchored to the stones of Lancre, then I can also go where the stones go. I am afraid I indulged in a little trickery to arrange matters. Currently I am haunting her apron.\u0027\n \u0027Not the first, either,\u0027 said Granny, automatically.\n \u0027Esme!\u0027\n \u0027And I beg you, Granny Weatherwax, to restore my son to the throne.\u0027\n \u0027Restore?\u0027\n \u0027You know what I mean. He is in good health?\u0027\n Granny nodded. \u0027The last time we Looked at him, he was eating an apple,\u0027 she said.\n \u0027It is his destiny to be King of Lancre!\u0027\n \u0027Yes, well. Destiny is tricky, you know,\u0027 said Granny.\n \u0027You will not help?\u0027\n Granny looked wretched. \u0027It\u0027s meddling, you see,\u0027 she said. \u0027It always goes wrong if you meddle in politics. Like, once you start, you can\u0027t stop. Fundamental rule of magic, is that. You can\u0027t go around messing with fundamental rules.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re not going to help?\u0027\n \u0027Well . . . naturally, one day, when your lad is a bit older . . .\u0027\n \u0027Where is he now?\u0027 said the king, coldly.\n The witches avoided one another\u0027s faces.\n \u0027We saw him safe out of the country, you see,\u0027 said Granny awkwardly.\n \u0027Very good family,\u0027 Nanny Ogg put in quickly.\n \u0027What kind of people?\u0027 said the king. \u0027Not commoners, I trust?\u0027\n \u0027Absolutely not,\u0027 said Granny with considerable firmness as a vision of Vitoller floated across her imagination. \u0027Not common at all. Very uncommon. Er.\u0027\n Her eyes implored Magrat for help.\n They were Thespians,\u0027 said Magrat firmly, her voice radiating such approval that the king found himself nodding automatically.\n \u0027Oh,\u0027 he said. \u0027Good.\u0027\n \u0027Were they?\u0027 whispered Nanny Ogg. \u0027They didn\u0027t look it.\u0027\n \u0027Don\u0027t show your ignorance, Gytha Ogg,\u0027 sniffed Granny. She turned back to the ghost of the king. \u0027Sorry about that, your majesty. It\u0027s just her showing off. She don\u0027t even know where Thespia is.\u0027\n \u0027Wherever it is, I hope that they know how to school a man in the arts of war,\u0027 said Verence. \u0027I know Felmet. In ten years he\u0027ll be dug in here like a toad in a stone.\u0027\n The king looked from witch to witch. \u0027What kind of kingdom will he have to come back to? I hear what the kingdom is becoming, even now. Will you watch it change, over the years, become shoddy and mean?\u0027 The king\u0027s ghost faded.\n His voice hung in the air, faint as a breeze.\n \u0027Remember, good sisters,\u0027 he said, \u0027the land and the king are one.\u0027\n And he vanished.\n The embarrassed silence was broken by Magrat blowing her nose.\n \u0027One what?\u0027 said Nanny Ogg.\n \u0027We\u0027ve got to do something,\u0027 said Magrat, her voice choked with emotion. \u0027Rules or no rules!\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s very vexing,\u0027 said Granny, quietly.\n \u0027Yes, but what are you going to do?\u0027 she said.\n \u0027Reflect on things,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027Think about it all.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027ve been thinking about it for a year,\u0027 Magrat said.\n \u0027One what? Are one what?\u0027 said Nanny Ogg.\n \u0027It\u0027s no good just reacting,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027You\u0027ve got to—\u0027\n A cart came bouncing and rumbling along the track from Lancre. Granny ignored it.\n \u0027—give these things careful consideration.\u0027\n \u0027You don\u0027t know what to do, do you?\u0027 said Magrat.\n \u0027Nonsense. I—\u0027\n \u0027There\u0027s a cart coming, Granny.\u0027\n Granny Weatherwax shrugged. \u0027What you youngsters don\u0027t realise—\u0027 she began.\n Witches never bothered with elementary road safety. Such traffic as there was on the roads of Lancre either went around them or, if this was not possible, waited until they moved out of the way. Granny Weatherwax had grown up knowing this for a fact; the only reason she didn\u0027t die knowing that it wasn\u0027t was that Magrat, with rather better reflexes, dragged her into the ditch.\n It was an interesting ditch. There were jiggling corkscrew things in it which were direct descendants of things which had been in the primordial soup of creation. Anyone who thought that ditchwater was dull could have spent an instructive half-hour in that ditch with a powerful microscope. It also had nettles in it, and now it had Granny Weatherwax.\n She struggled up through the weeds, incoherent with rage, and rose from the ditch like Venus Anadyomene, only older and with more duckweed.\n \u0027T-t-t,\u0027 she said, pointing a shaking finger at the disappearing cart.\n \u0027It was young Nesheley from over Inkcap way,\u0027 said Nanny Ogg, from a nearby bush. \u0027His family were always a bit wild. Of course, his mother was a Whipple.\u0027\n \u0027He ran us down!\u0027 said Granny.\n \u0027You could have got out of the way,\u0027 said Magrat.\n \u0027Get out of the way?\u0027 said Granny. \u0027We\u0027re witches! People get out of our way!\u0027 She squelched on to the track, her finger still pointing at the distant cart. \u0027By Hoki, I\u0027ll make him wish he\u0027d never been born—\u0027\n \u0027He was quite a big baby, I recall,\u0027 said the bush. \u0027His mother had a terrible time.\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s never happened to me before, ever,\u0027 said Granny, still twanging like a bowstring. \u0027I\u0027ll teach him to run us down as though, as though, as though we was ordinary people!\u0027\n \u0027He already knows,\u0027 said Magrat. \u0027Just help me get Nanny out of this bush, will you?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ll turn his-\u0027\n \u0027People haven\u0027t got any respect any more, that\u0027s what it is,\u0027 said Nanny, as Magrat helped her with the thorns. \u0027It\u0027s all due to the king being one, I expect.\u0027\n \u0027We\u0027re witches!\u0027 screamed Granny, turning her face towards the sky and shaking her fists.\n \u0027Yes, yes,\u0027 said Magrat. \u0027The harmonious balance of the universe and everything. I think Nanny\u0027s a bit tired.\u0027\n \u0027What\u0027ve I been doing all this time?\u0027 said Granny, with a rhetorical flourish that would have made even Vitoller gasp.\n \u0027Not a lot,\u0027 said Magrat.\n \u0027Laughed at! Laughed at! On my own roads! In my own country!\u0027 screamed Granny. \u0027That just about does it! I\u0027m not taking ten more years of this! I\u0027m not taking another day of it!\u0027\n The trees around her began to sway and the dust from the road sprang up into, writhing shapes that tried to swirl out of her way. Granny Weatherwax extended one long arm and at the end of it unfolded one long finger and from the rip of its curving nail there was a brief flare of octarine fire.\n Half a mile down the track all four wheels fell off the cart at once.\n \u0027Lock up a witch, would he?\u0027 Granny shouted at the trees.\n Nanny struggled to her feet.\n \u0027We\u0027d better grab her,\u0027 she whispered to Magrat. The two of them leapt at Granny and forced her arms down to her sides.\n \u0027I\u0027ll bloody well show him what a witch could do!\u0027 she yelled.\n \u0027Yes, yes, very good, very good,\u0027 said Nanny. \u0027Only perhaps not just now and not just like this, eh?\u0027\n \u0027Wyrd sisters, indeed!\u0027 Granny yelled. \u0027I\u0027ll make his—\u0027\n \u0027Hold her a minute, Magrat,\u0027 said Nanny Ogg, and rolled up her sleeve.\n \u0027It can be like this with the highly-trained ones,\u0027 she said, and brought her palm round in a slap that lifted both witches off their feet. On such a flat, final note the universe ought have ended.\n At the conclusion of the breathless silence which followed Granny Weatherwax said, \u0027Thank you.\u0027\n She adjusted her dress with some show of dignity, and added, \u0027But I meant it. We\u0027ll meet tonight at the stone and do what must be done. Ahem.\u0027\n She reset the pins in her hat and set off unsteadily in the direction of her cottage.\n \u0027Whatever happened to the rule about not meddling in politics?\u0027 said Magrat, watching her retreating back.\n Nanny Ogg massaged some life back into her fingers.\n \u0027By Hoki, that woman\u0027s got a jaw like an anvil,\u0027 she said \u0027What was that?\u0027\n \u0027I said, what about this rule about not meddling?\u0027 said Magrat.\n \u0027Ah,\u0027 said Nanny. She took the girl\u0027s arm. \u0027The thing is,\u0027 she explained, \u0027as you progress in the Craft, you\u0027ll learn there is another rule. Esme\u0027s obeyed it all her life.\u0027\n \u0027And what\u0027s that?\u0027\n \u0027When you break rules, break \u0027em good and hard,\u0027 said Nanny, and grinned a set of gums that were more menacing than teeth.\n The duke smiled out over the forest.\n \u0027It works,\u0027 he said. \u0027The people mutter against the witches. How do you do it, Fool?\u0027\n \u0027Jokes, nuncle. And gossip. People are halfway ready to believe it anyway. Everyone respects the witches. The point is that no-one actually likes them very much.\u0027\n Friday afternoon, he thought. I\u0027ll have to get some flowers. And my best suit, the one with the silver bells. Oh gosh.\n \u0027This is very pleasing. If it goes on like this, Fool, you shall have a knighthood.\u0027\n This was no.302, and the Fool knew better than to let a feed line go hungry. \u0027Marry, nuncle,\u0027 he said wearily, ignoring the spasm of pain that crawled across the duke\u0027s face, \u0027if n I had a Knighthood (Night Hood), why, it would keep my ears Warm in Bedde; i\u0027faith, if many a Knight is a Fool, why, should a—\u0027\n \u0027Yes, yes, all right,\u0027 snapped Lord Felmet. In fact he was feeling much better already. His porridge hadn\u0027t been oversalted this evening, and there was a decently empty feel about the castle. There were no more voices on the cusp of hearing.\n He sat down on the throne. It felt really comfortable for the first time . . .\n The duchess sat beside him, her chin on her hand, watching the Fool intently. This bothered him. He thought he knew where he stood with the duke, it was just a matter of hanging on until his madness curved back to the cheerful stage, but the duchess genuinely frightened him.\n \u0027It seems that words are extremely powerful,\u0027 she said.\n \u0027Indeed, lady.\u0027\n \u0027You must have made a lengthy study.\u0027\n The Fool nodded. The power of words had sustained him through the hell of the Guild. Wizards and witches used words as if they were tools to get things done, but the Fool reckoned that words were things in their own right.\n \u0027Words can change the world,\u0027 he said.\n Her eyes narrowed.\n \u0027So you have said before. I remain unconvinced. Strong men change the world,\u0027 she said. \u0027Strong men and their deeds. Words are just like marzipan on a cake. Of course you think words are important. You are weak, you have nothing else.\u0027\n \u0027Your ladyship is wrong.\u0027\n The duchess\u0027s fat hand drummed impatiently on the arm of her throne.\n \u0027You had better,\u0027 she said, \u0027be able to substantiate that comment.\u0027\n \u0027Lady, the duke wishes to chop down the forests, is this not so?\u0027\n \u0027The trees talk about me,\u0027 whispered Lord Felmet. \u0027I hear them whisper when I go riding. They tell lies about me!\u0027\n The duchess and the Fool exchanged glances. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wyrd-sisters-discworld-6/page-21.html","bookId":1625,"book":{"id":1625,"title":"Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6)","description":"Storyline: \n Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6) \n Witches are not by nature gregarious, and they certainly don\u0027t have leaders.
