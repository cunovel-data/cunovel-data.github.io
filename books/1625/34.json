Of course. Now, this play . . .\u0027\n \u0027My lord wants something to convince people that he is the rightful King of Lancre. Himself mostly, I think.\u0027\n \u0027Is that why you went to the city?\u0027\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s disgusting!\u0027\n The Fool sat calmly. \u0027You would prefer the duchess\u0027s approach?\u0027 he said. \u0027She just thinks they ought to kill everyone. She\u0027s good at that sort of thing. And then there\u0027d be fighting, and everything. Lots of people would die anyway. This way might be easier.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, where\u0027s your spunk, man?\u0027\n \u0027Pardon?\u0027\n \u0027Don\u0027t you want to die nobly for a just cause?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027d much rather live quietly for one. It\u0027s all right for you witches, you can do what you like, but I\u0027m circumscribed,\u0027 said the Fool.\n Magrat sat down beside him. Find out all about this play, Granny had ordered. Go and talk to that jingling friend of yours. She\u0027d replied, He\u0027s very loyal. He might not tell me anything. And Granny had said, This is no time for half measures. If you have to, seduct him.\n \u0027When\u0027s this play going to be, then?\u0027 she said, moving closer.\n \u0027Marry, I\u0027m sure I\u0027m not allowed to tell you,\u0027 said the Fool. \u0027The duke said to me, he said, don\u0027t tell the witches that it\u0027s tomorrow night.\u0027\n \u0027I shouldn\u0027t, then,\u0027 agreed Magrat.\n \u0027At eight o\u0027clock.\u0027\n \u0027I see.\u0027\n \u0027But meet for sherry beforehand at seven-thirty, i\u0027faith.\u0027\n \u0027I expect you shouldn\u0027t tell me who is invited, either,\u0027 said Magrat.\n \u0027That\u0027s right. Most of the dignitaries of Lancre. You understand I\u0027m not telling you this.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s right,\u0027 said Magrat.\n \u0027But I think you have a right to know what it is you\u0027re not being told.\u0027\n \u0027Good point. Is there still that little gate around the back, that leads to the kitchens?\u0027\n \u0027The one that is often left unguarded?\u0027\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, we hardly ever guard it these days.\u0027\n \u0027Do you think there might be someone guarding it at around eight o\u0027clock tomorrow?\u0027\n \u0027Well, I might be there.\u0027\n \u0027Good.\u0027\n The Fool pushed away the wet nose of an inquisitive cow.\n \u0027The duke will be expecting you,\u0027 he added.\n \u0027You said he said we weren\u0027t to know.\u0027\n \u0027He said I mustn\u0027t tell you. But he also said, “They\u0027ll come anyway, I hope they do.” Strange, really. He seemed in a very good mood when he said it. Um. Can I see you after the show?\u0027\n \u0027Is that all he said?\u0027\n \u0027Oh, there was something about showing witches their future. I didn\u0027t understand it. I really would like to see you after the show, you know. I brought—\u0027\n \u0027I think I might be washing my hair,\u0027 said Magrat vaguely. \u0027Excuse me, I really ought to be going.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, but I brought you this pres—\u0027 said the Fool vaguely, watching her departing figure.\n He sagged as she disappeared between the trees, and looked down at the necklace wound tightly between his nervous fingers. It was, he had to admit, terribly tasteless, but it was the sort of thing she liked, all silver and skulls. It had cost him too much.\n A cow, misled by his horns, stuck its tongue in his ear.\n It was true, the Fool thought. Witches did do unpleasant things to people, sometimes.\n Tomorrow night came, and the witches went by a roundabout route to the castle, with considerable reluctance.\n \u0027If he wants us to be here, I don\u0027t want to go,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027He\u0027s got some plan. He\u0027s using headology on us.\u0027\n \u0027There\u0027s something up,\u0027 said Magrat. \u0027He had his men set fire to three cottages in our village last night. He always does that when he\u0027s in a good mood. That new sergeant is a quick man with the matches, too.\u0027\n \u0027Our Daff said she saw them actors practisin\u0027 this morning,\u0027 said Nanny Ogg, who was carrying a bag\u0027of walnuts and a leather bottle from which rose a rich, sharp smell. \u0027She said it was all shouting and stabbing and then wondering who done it and long bits with people muttering to themselves in loud voices.\u0027\n \u0027Actors,\u0027 said Granny, witheringly. \u0027As if the world weren\u0027t full of enough history without inventing more.\u0027\n \u0027They shout so loud, too,\u0027 said Nanny. \u0027You can hardly hear yourself talk.\u0027 She was also carrying, deep in her apron pocket, a lump of haunted castle rock. The king was getting in free.\n Granny nodded. But, she thought, it was going to be worth it. She hadn\u0027t got the faintest idea what Tomjon had in mind, but her inbuilt sense of drama assured her that the boy would be bound to do something important. She wondered if he would leap off the stage and stab the duke to death, and realised that she was hoping like hell that he would.\n \u0027All hail wossname,\u0027 she said under her breath, \u0027who shall be king here, after.\u0027\n \u0027Let\u0027s get a move on,\u0027 said Nanny. \u0027All the sherry\u0027ll be gone.\u0027\n The Fool was waiting despondently inside the little wicket gate. His face brightened when he saw Magrat, and then froze in an expression of polite surprise when he saw the other two.\n \u0027There\u0027s not going to be any trouble, is there?\u0027 he said. \u0027I don\u0027t want there to be any trouble. Please.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m sure I don\u0027t know what you mean,\u0027 said Granny regally, sweeping past.\n \u0027Wotcha, jinglebells,\u0027 said Nanny, elbowing the man in the ribs. \u0027I hope you haven\u0027t been keeping our girl here up late o\u0027nights!\u0027\n \u0027Nanny!\u0027 said Magrat, shocked. The Fool gave the terrified, ingratiating rictus of young men everywhere when confronted by importunate elderly women commenting on their intimately personal lives.\n The older witches brushed past. The Fool grabbed Magrat\u0027s hand.\n \u0027I know where we can get a good view,\u0027 he said.\n She hesitated.\n \u0027It\u0027s all right,\u0027 said the Fool urgently. \u0027You\u0027ll be perfectly safe with me.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, I will, won\u0027t I,\u0027 said Magrat, trying to look around him to see where the others had gone.\n \u0027They\u0027re staging the play outside, in the big courtyard. We\u0027ll get a lovely view from one of the gate towers, and no-one else will be there. I put some wine up there for us, and everything.\u0027\n When she still looked half-reluctant he added, \u0027And there\u0027s a cistern of water and a fireplace that the guards use sometimes. In case you want to wash your hair.\u0027\n The castle was full of people standing around in that polite, sheepish way affected by people who see each other all day and are now seeing each other again in unusual social circumstances, like an office party. The witches passed quite unremarked among them and found seats in the rows of benches in the main courtyard, set up before a hastily assembled stage.\n Nanny Ogg waved her bag of walnuts at Granny.\n \u0027Want one?\u0027 she said.\n An alderman of Lancre shuffled past her and pointed politely to the seat on her left.\n \u0027Is anyone sitting here?\u0027 he said.\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Nanny.\n The alderman looked distractedly at the rest of the benches, which were filling up fast, and then down at the clearly empty space in front of him. He hitched up his robes with a determined expression.\n \u0027I think that since the play is commencing to start, your friends must find a seat elsewhere, when they arrive,\u0027 he said, and sat down.\n Within seconds his face went white. His teeth began to chatter. He clutched at his stomach and groaned.[20]\n \u0027I told you,\u0027 said Nanny, as he lurched away. \u0027What\u0027s the good of asking if you\u0027re not going to listen?\u0027 She leaned towards the empty seat. \u0027Walnut?\u0027\n \u0027No, thank you,\u0027 said King Verence, waving a spectral hand. \u0027They go right through me, you know.\u0027\n \u0027Pray, gentles all, list to our tale . . .\u0027\n \u0027What\u0027s this?\u0027 hissed Granny. \u0027Who\u0027s the fellow in the tights?\u0027\n \u0027He\u0027s the Prologue,\u0027 said Nanny. \u0027You have to have him at the beginning so everyone knows what the play\u0027s about.\u0027\n \u0027Can\u0027t understand a word of it,\u0027 muttered Granny. \u0027What\u0027s a gentle, anyway?\u0027\n \u0027Type of maggot,\u0027 said Nanny.\n \u0027That\u0027s nice, isn\u0027t it? “Hallo maggots, welcome to the show.” Puts people in a nice frame of mind, doesn\u0027t it?\u0027\n There was a chorus of \u0027sshs\u0027.\n \u0027These walnuts are damn tough,\u0027 said Nanny, spitting one out into her hand. \u0027I\u0027m going to have to take my shoe off to this one.\u0027\n Granny subsided into unaccustomed, troubled silence, and tried to listen to the prologue. The theatre worried her. It had a magic of its own, one that didn\u0027t belong to her, one that wasn\u0027t in her control. It changed the world, and said things were otherwise than they were. And it was worse than that. It was magic that didn\u0027t belong to magical people. It was commanded by ordinary people, who didn\u0027t know the rules. They altered the world because it sounded better.\n The duke and duchess were sitting on their thrones right in front of the stage. As Granny glared at them the duke half turned, and she saw his smile.\n I want the world the way it is, she thought. I want the past the way it was. The past used to be a lot better than it is now.\n And the band struck up.\n Hwel peered around a pillar and signalled to Wimsloe and Brattsley, who hobbled out into the glare of the torches.\n OLD MAN (an Elder): \u0027What hath befell the land?\u0027\n OLD WOMAN (a Crone): \u0027 \u0027Tis a terror—\u0027\n The dwarf watched them for a few seconds from the wings, his lips moving soundlessly. Then he scuttled back to the guardroom where the rest of the cast were still in the last hasty stages of dressing. He uttered the stage manager\u0027s traditional scream of rage.\n \u0027C\u0027mon,\u0027 he ordered. \u0027Soldiers of the king, at the double! And the witches – where are the blasted witches?\u0027\n Three junior apprentices presented themselves.\n \u0027I\u0027ve lost my wart!\u0027\n \u0027The cauldron\u0027s all full of yuk!\u0027\n \u0027There\u0027s something living in this wig!\u0027\n \u0027Calm down, calm down,\u0027 screamed Hwel. \u0027It\u0027ll all be all right on the night!\u0027\n \u0027This is the night, Hwel!\u0027\n Hwel snatched a handful of putty from the makeup table and slammed on a wart like an orange. The offending straw wig was rammed on its owner\u0027s head, livestock and all. and the cauldron was very briefly inspected and pronounced full of just the right sort of yuk, nothing wrong with yuk like that.\n On stage a guard dropped his shield, bent down to pick it up, and dropped his spear. Hwel rolled his eyes and offered up a silent prayer to any gods that might be watching.\n It was already going wrong. The earlier rehearsals had their little teething troubles, it was true, but Hwel had known one or two monumental horrors in his time and this one was shaping up to be the worst. The company was more jittery than a potful of lobsters. Out of the corner of his ear he heard the on-stage dialogue falter, and scurried to the wings.\n \u0027—avenge the terror of thy father\u0027s death—\u0027 he hissed, and hurried back to the trembling witches. He groaned. Divers alarums. This lot were supposed to be terrorising a kingdom. He had about a minute before the cue.\n \u0027Right!\u0027 he said, pulling himself together. \u0027Now, what are you? You\u0027re evil hags, right?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, Hwel,\u0027 they said meekly.\n \u0027Tell me what you are,\u0027 he commanded.\n \u0027We\u0027re evil hags, Hwel.\u0027\n \u0027Louder!\u0027\n \u0027We\u0027re Evil Hags!\u0027\n Hwel stalked the length of the quaking line, then turned abruptly on his heel, \u0027And what are you going to do?\u0027\n The 2nd Witche scratched his crawling wig.\n \u0027We\u0027re going to curse people?\u0027 he ventured. \u0027It says in the script—\u0027\n \u0027I-can\u0027t-HEAR-you!\u0027\n \u0027We\u0027re going to curse people!\u0027 they chorused, springing to attention and staring straight ahead to avoid his gaze.\n Hwel stumped back along the line.\n \u0027What are you?\u0027\n \u0027We\u0027re hags, Hwel!\u0027\n \u0027What kind of hags?\u0027\n \u0027We\u0027re black and midnight hags!\u0027 they yelled, getting into the spirit.\n \u0027What kind of black and midnight hags?\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wyrd-sisters-discworld-6/page-34.html","bookId":1625,"book":{"id":1625,"title":"Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6)","description":"Storyline: \n Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6) \n Witches are not by nature gregarious, and they certainly don\u0027t have leaders.
