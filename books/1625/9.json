{"id":95574,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"\u0027Only now no-one must say Felmet killed the king,\u0027 said Magrat.\n \u0027What?\u0027 said Granny.\n \u0027He had some people executed in Lancre, the other day for saying it,\u0027 Magrat went on. \u0027Spreading malicious lies, he said. He said anyone saying different will see the inside of his dungeons, only not for long. He said Verence died of natural causes.\u0027\n \u0027Well, being assassinated is natural causes for a king,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027I don\u0027t see why he\u0027s so sheepish about it. When old Thargum was killed they stuck his head on a pole, had a big bonfire and everyone in the palace got drunk for a week.\u0027\n \u0027I remember,\u0027 said Nanny. \u0027They carried his head all round the villages to show he was dead. Very convincing, I thought. Specially for him. He was grinning. I think it was the way he would have liked to go.\u0027\n \u0027I think we might have to keep an eye on this one, though,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027I think he might be a bit clever. That\u0027s not a good thing, in a king. And I don\u0027t think he knows how to show respect.\u0027\n \u0027A man came to see me last week to ask if I wanted to pay any taxes,\u0027 said Magrat. \u0027I told him no.\u0027\n \u0027He came to see me, too,\u0027 said Nanny Ogg. \u0027But our Jason and our Wane went out and tole him we didn\u0027t want to join.\u0027\n \u0027Small man, bald, black cloak?\u0027 said Granny thoughtfully.\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said the other two.\n \u0027He was hanging about in my raspberry bushes,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027Only, when I went out to see what he wanted, he ran away.\u0027\n \u0027Actually, I gave him tuppence,\u0027 said Magrat. \u0027He said he was going to be tortured, you see, if he didn\u0027t get witches to pay their taxes . . .\u0027\n Lord Felmet looked carefully at the two coins in his lap.\n Then he looked at his tax gatherer.\n \u0027Well?\u0027 he said.\n The tax gatherer cleared his throat. \u0027Well, sir, you see. I explained about the need to employ a standing army, ekcetra, and they said why, and I said because of bandits, ekcetra, and they said bandits never bothered them.\u0027\n \u0027And civil works?\u0027\n \u0027Ah. Yes. Well, I pointed out the need to build and maintain bridges, ekcetra.\u0027\n \u0027And?\u0027\n \u0027They said they didn\u0027t use them.\u0027\n \u0027Ah,\u0027 said the duke knowledgeably. \u0027They can\u0027t cross running water.\u0027\n \u0027Not sure about that, sir. I think witches cross anything they like.\u0027\n \u0027Did they say anything else?\u0027 said the duke.\n The tax gatherer twisted the hem of his robe distractedly.\n \u0027Well, sir. I mentioned how taxes help to maintain the King\u0027s Peace, sir . . . \u0027\n \u0027And?\u0027\n \u0027They said the king should maintain his own peace, sir. And then they gave me a look.\u0027\n \u0027What sort of look?\u0027\n The duke sat with his thin face cupped in one hand. He was fascinated.\n \u0027It\u0027s sort of hard to describe,\u0027 said the taxman. He tried to avoid Lord Felmet\u0027s gaze, which was giving him the distinct impression that the tiled floor was fleeing away in all directions and had already covered several acres. Lord Felmet\u0027s fascination was to him what a pin is to a Purple Emperor.\n \u0027Try,\u0027 the duke invited.\n The taxman blushed.\n \u0027Well,\u0027 he said. \u0027It . . . wasn\u0027t nice.\u0027\n Which demonstrates that the tax gatherer was much better at figures than words. What he would have said, if embarrassment, fear, poor memory and a complete lack of any kind of imagination hadn\u0027t conspired against it, was:\n \u0027When I was a little boy, and staying with my aunt, and she had told me not to touch the cream, ekcetra, and she had put it on a high shelf in the pantry, and I got a stool and went after it when she was out anyway, and she\u0027d come back and I didn\u0027t know, and I couldn\u0027t reach the bowl properly and it smashed on the floor, and she opened the door and glared at me: it was that look. But the worst thing was, they knew it.\u0027\n \u0027Not nice,\u0027 said the duke.\n \u0027No, sir.\u0027\n The duke drummed the fingers of his left hand on the arm of his throne. The tax gatherer coughed again.\n \u0027You\u0027re – you\u0027re not going to force me to go back, are you?\u0027 he said.\n \u0027Um?\u0027 said the duke. He waved a hand irritably. \u0027No, no,\u0027 he said. \u0027Not at all. Just call in at the torturer on your way out. See when he can fit you in.\u0027\n The taxman gave him a look of gratitude, and bobbed a bow.\n \u0027Yes, sir. At once, sir. Thank you, sir. You\u0027re very—\u0027\n \u0027Yes, yes,\u0027 said Lord Felmet, absently. \u0027You may go.\u0027\n The duke was left alone in the vastness of the hall. It was raining again. Every once in a while a piece of plaster smashed down on the tiles, and there was a crunching from the walls as they settled still further. The air smelled of old cellars.\n Gods, he hated this kingdom.\n It was so small, only forty miles long and maybe ten miles wide, and nearly all of it was cruel mountains with ice-green slopes and knife-edge crests, or dense huddled forests. A kingdom like that shouldn\u0027t be any trouble.\n What he couldn\u0027t quite fathom was this feeling that it had depth. It seemed to contain far too much geography.\n He rose and paced the floor to the balcony, with its unrivalled view of trees. It struck him that the trees were also looking back at him.\n He could feel the resentment. But that was odd, because the people themselves hadn\u0027t objected. They didn\u0027t seem to object to anything very much. Verence had been popular enough, in his way. There\u0027d been quite a turnout for the funeral; he recalled the lines of solemn faces. Not stupid faces. By no means stupid. Just preoccupied, as though what kings did wasn\u0027t really very important.\n He found that almost as annoying as trees. A jolly good riot, now, that would have been more – more appropriate. One could have ridden out and hanged people, there would have been the creative tension so essential to the proper development of the state. Back down on the plains, if you kicked people they kicked back. Up here, when you kicked people they moved away and just waited patiently for your leg to fall off. How could a king go down in history ruling a people like that? You couldn\u0027t oppress them any more than you could oppress a mattress.\n He had raised taxes and burned a few villages on general principles, just to show everyone who they were dealing with. It didn\u0027t seem to have any effect.\n And then there were these witches. They haunted him.\n \u0027Fool!\u0027\n The Fool, who had been having a quiet doze behind the throne, awoke in terror.\n \u0027Yes!\u0027\n \u0027Come hither, Fool.\u0027\n The Fool jingled miserably across the floor.\n \u0027Tell me, Fool, does it always rain here?\u0027\n \u0027Marry, nuncle—\u0027\n \u0027Just answer the question,\u0027 said Lord Felmet, with iron patience.\n \u0027Sometimes it stops, sir. To make room for the snow. And sometimes we get some right squand\u0027ring orgulous fogs,\u0027 said the Fool.\n \u0027Orgulous?\u0027 said the duke, absently.\n The Fool couldn\u0027t stop himself. His horrified ears heard his mouth blurt out: Thick, my lord. From the Latatian orgulum, a soup or broth.\u0027\n But the duke wasn\u0027t listening. Listening to the prattle of underlings was not, in his experience, particularly worthwhile.\n \u0027I am bored, Fool.\u0027\n \u0027Let me entertain you, my lord, with many a merry quip and lightsome jest.\u0027\n \u0027Try me.\u0027\n The Fool licked his dry lips. He hadn\u0027t actually expected this. King Verence had been happy enough just to give him a kick, or throw a bottle at his head. A real king.\n \u0027I\u0027m waiting. Make me laugh.\u0027\n The Fool took the plunge.\n \u0027Why, sirrah,\u0027 he quavered, \u0027why may a caudled fillhorse be deemed the brother to a hiren candle in the night?\u0027\n The duke frowned. The Fool felt it better not to wait.\n \u0027Withal, because a candle may be greased, yet a fillhorse be without a fat argier,\u0027 he said and, because it was part of the joke, patted Lord Felmet lightly with his balloon on a stick and twanged his mandolin.\n The duke\u0027s index finger tapped an abrupt tattoo on the arm of the throne.\n \u0027Yes?\u0027 he said. \u0027And then what happened?\u0027\n \u0027That, er, was by way of being the whole thing,\u0027 said the Fool, and added, \u0027My grandad thought it was one of his best.\u0027\n \u0027I daresay he told it differently,\u0027 said the duke. He stood up. \u0027Summon my huntsmen. I think I shall ride out on the chase. And you can come too.\u0027\n \u0027My lord, I cannot ride!\u0027\n For the first time that morning Lord Felmet smiled.\n \u0027Capital!\u0027 he said. \u0027We will give you a horse that can\u0027t be ridden. Ha. Ha.\u0027\n He looked down at his bandages. And afterwards, he told himself, I\u0027ll get the armourer to send me up a file.\n A year went past. The days followed one another patiently. Right back at the beginning of the multiverse they had tried all passing at the same time, and it hadn\u0027t worked.\n Tomjon sat under Hwel\u0027s rickety table, watching his father as he walked up and down between the lattys, waving one arm and talking. Vitoller always waved his arms when he spoke; if you tied his hands behind his back he would be dumb.\n \u0027All right,\u0027 he was saying, \u0027how about The King\u0027s Brides?\u0027\n \u0027Last year,\u0027 said the voice of Hwel.\n \u0027All right, then. We\u0027ll give them Mallo, the Tyrant of Klatch,\u0027 said Vitoller, and his larynx smoothly changed gear as his voice became a great rolling thing that could rattle the windows across the width of the average town square. \u0027 “In blood I came, And by blood rule, That none will dare assay these walls of blood—” \u0027\n \u0027We did it the year before,\u0027 said Hwel calmly. \u0027Anyway, people are fed up with kings. They want a bit of a chuckle.\u0027\n \u0027They are not fed up with my kings,\u0027 said Vitoller. \u0027My dear boy, people do not come to the theatre to laugh, they come to Experience, to Learn, to Wonder—\u0027\n \u0027To laugh,\u0027 said Hwel, flatly. \u0027Have a look at this one.\u0027\n Tomjon heard the rustle of paper and the creak of wicker-work as Vitoller lowered his weight on to a props basket.\n \u0027A Wizard of Sons,\u0027 Vitoller read. \u0027Or, Please Yourself:\n Hwel stretched his legs under the table and dislodged Tomjon. He hauled the boy out by one ear.\n \u0027What\u0027s this?\u0027 said Vitoller. \u0027Wizards? Demons? Imps? Merchants?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m rather pleased with Act II, Scene IV,\u0027 said Hwel, propelling the toddler towards the props box. \u0027Comic Washing Up with Two Servants.\u0027\n \u0027Any death-bed scenes?\u0027 said Vitoller hopefully.\n \u0027No-o,\u0027 said Hwel. \u0027But I can do you a humorous monologue in Act III.\u0027\n \u0027A humorous monologue!\u0027\n \u0027All right, there\u0027s room for a soliloquy in the last act,\u0027 said Hwel hurriedly. \u0027I\u0027ll write one tonight, no problem.\u0027\n \u0027And a stabbing,\u0027 said Vitoller, getting to his feet. \u0027A foul murder. That always goes down well.\u0027\n He strode away to organise the setting up of the stage.\n Hwel sighed, and picked up his quill. Somewhere behind the sacking walls was the town of Hangdog, which had somehow allowed itself to be built in a hollow perched in the nearly sheer walls of a canyon. There was plenty of flat ground in the Ramtops. The problem was that nearly all of it was vertical.\n Hwel didn\u0027t like the Ramtops, which was odd because it was traditional dwarf country and he was a dwarf. But he\u0027d been banished from his tribe years ago, not only because of his claustrophobia but also because he had a tendency to daydream. It was felt by the local dwarf king that this is not a valuable talent for someone who is supposed to swing a pickaxe without forgetting what he is supposed to hit with it, and so Hwel had been given a very small bag of gold, the tribe\u0027s heartfelt best wishes, and a firm goodbye.\n It had happened that Vitoller\u0027s strolling players had been passing through at the time, and the dwarf had ventured one small copper coin on a performance of The Dragon of the Plains. He had watched it without a muscle moving in his face, gone back to his lodgings, and in the morning had knocked on Vitoller\u0027s latty with the first draft of King Under the Mountain. It wasn\u0027t in fact very good, but Vitoller had been perceptive enough to see that inside the hairy bullet head was an imagination big enough to bestride the world and so, when the strolling players strolled off, one of them was running to keep up . . . \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wyrd-sisters-discworld-6/page-9.html","bookId":1625,"book":{"id":1625,"title":"Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6)","description":"Storyline: \n Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6) \n Witches are not by nature gregarious, and they certainly don\u0027t have leaders.
