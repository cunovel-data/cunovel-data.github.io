She turned to face the dawn, raised her arms, and completed the spell.\\n\\n It is almost impossible to convey the sudden passage of fifteen years and two months in words.\\n\\n It\u0027s a lot easier in pictures, when you just use a calendar with lots of pages blowing off, or a clock with hands moving faster and faster until they blur, or trees bursting into blossom and fruiting in a matter of seconds . . .\\n\\n Well, you know. Or the sun becomes a fiery streak across the sky, and days and nights flicker past jerkily like a bad zoetrope, and the fashions visible in the clothes shop across the road whip on and off faster than a lunchtime stripper with five pubs to do.\\n\\n There are any amount of ways, but they won\u0027t be required because, in fact, none of this happened.\\n\\n The sun did jerk sideways a bit, and it seemed that the trees on the rimward side of the gorge were rather taller, and Nanny couldn\u0027t shake off the sensation that someone had just sat down heavily on her, squashed her flat, and then opened her out again.\\n\\n This was because the kingdom did not, in so many words, move through time in the normal flickering sky, high-speed photography sense of the word. It moved around it, which is much cleaner, considerably easier to achieve, and saves all that travelling around trying to find a laboratory opposite a dress shop that will keep the same dummy in the window for sixty years, which has traditionally been the most time-consuming and expensive bit of the whole business.\\n\\n The kiss lasted more than fifteen years.\\n\\n Not even frogs can manage that.\\n\\n The Fool drew back, his eyes glazed, his expression one of puzzlement.\\n\\n \u0027Did you feel the world move?\u0027 he said.\\n\\n Magrat peered over his shoulder at the forest.\\n\\n \u0027I think she\u0027s done it,\u0027 she said.\\n\\n \u0027Done what?\u0027\\n\\n Magrat hesitated. \u0027Oh. Nothing. Nothing much, really.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Shall we have another try? I don\u0027t think we got it quite right that time.\u0027\\n\\n Magrat nodded.\\n\\n This time it lasted only fifteen seconds. It seemed longer.\\n\\n A tremor ran through the castle, shaking the breakfast tray from which the Duke Felmet, much to his relief, was eating porridge that wasn\u0027t too salty.\\n\\n It was felt by the ghosts that now filled Nanny Ogg\u0027s cottage like a rugby team in a telephone box.\\n\\n It spread to every henhouse in the kingdom, and a number of hands relaxed their grip. And thirty-two purple-faced cockerels took a deep bream and crowed like maniacs, but they were too late, too late . . .\\n\\n \u0027I still reckon you were up to something,\u0027 said Granny Weatherwax.\\n\\n \u0027Have another cup of tea,\u0027 said Nanny pleasantly.\\n\\n \u0027You won\u0027t go and put any drink in it, will you,\u0027 Granny said flatly. \u0027It was the drink what did it last night. I would never have put myself forward like that. It\u0027s shameful.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Black Aliss never done anything like it,\u0027 said Nanny, encouragingly. \u0027I mean, it was a hundred years, all right, but it was only one castle she moved. I reckon anyone could do a castle.\u0027\\n\\n Granny\u0027s frown puckered at the edge.\\n\\n \u0027And she let all weeds grow over it,\u0027 she observed primly.\\n\\n \u0027Right enough.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Very well done,\u0027 said King Verence, eagerly. \u0027We all thought it was superb. Being in the ethereal plane, of course, we were in a position to observe closely.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Very good, your graciousness,\u0027 said Nanny Ogg. She turned and observed the crowding ghosts behind him, who hadn\u0027t been granted the privilege of sitting at, or partly through, the kitchen table.\\n\\n \u0027But you lot can bugger off back to the outhouse,\u0027 she said. \u0027The cheek! Except the kiddies, they can stay,\u0027 she added. \u0027Poor little mites.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I am afraid it feels so good to be out of the castle,\u0027 said the king.\\n\\n Granny Weatherwax yawned.\\n\\n \u0027Anyway,\u0027 she said, \u0027we\u0027ve got to find the boy now. That\u0027s the next step.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We shall look for him directly after lunch.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Lunch?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s chicken,\u0027 said Nanny. \u0027And you\u0027re tired. Besides, making a decent search will take a long time.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027ll be in Ankh-Morpork,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027Mark my words. Everyone ends up there. We\u0027ll start with Ankh-Morpork. You don\u0027t have to search for people when destiny is involved, you just wait for them in Ankh-Morpork.\u0027\\n\\n Nanny brightened up. \u0027Our Karen got married to an innkeeper from there,\u0027 she said. \u0027I haven\u0027t seen the baby yet. We could get free board and everything.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We needn\u0027t actually go. The whole point is that he should come here. There\u0027s something about that city,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027It\u0027s like a drain.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s five hundred miles away!\u0027 said Magrat. \u0027You\u0027ll be away for ages!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I can\u0027t help it,\u0027 said the Fool. \u0027The duke\u0027s given me special instructions. He trusts me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Huh! To hire more soldiers, I expect?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No. Nothing like that. Not as bad as that.\u0027 The Fool hesitated. He\u0027d introduced Felmet to the world of words. Surely that was better than hitting people with swords? Wouldn\u0027t that buy time? Wouldn\u0027t it be best for everybody, in the circumstances?\\n\\n \u0027But you don\u0027t have to go! You don\u0027t want to go!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That doesn\u0027t have much to do with it. I promised to be loyal to him—\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, yes, until you\u0027re dead. But you don\u0027t even believe that! You were telling me how much you hated the whole Guild and everything!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, yes. But I still have to do it. I gave my word.\u0027\\n\\n Magrat came close to stamping her foot, but didn\u0027t sink so low.\\n\\n \u0027Just when we were getting to know one another!\u0027 she shouted. \u0027You\u0027re pathetic!\u0027\\n\\n The Fool\u0027s eyes narrowed. \u0027I\u0027d only be pathetic if I broke my word,\u0027 he said. \u0027But I may be incredibly ill-advised. I\u0027m sorry. I\u0027ll be back in a few weeks, anyway.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t you understand I\u0027m asking you not to listen to him?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I said I\u0027m sorry. I couldn\u0027t see you again before I go, could I?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I shall be washing my hair,\u0027 said Magrat stiffly.\\n\\n \u0027When?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Whenever!\u0027\\n\\n Hwel pinched the bridge of his nose and squinted wearily at the wax-spattered paper.\\n\\n The play wasn\u0027t going at all well.\\n\\n He\u0027d sorted out the falling chandelier, and found a place for a villain who wore a mask to conceal his disfigurement, and he\u0027d rewritten one of the funny bits to allow for the fact that the hero had been born in a handbag. It was the clowns who were giving him trouble again. They kept changing every time he thought about them. He preferred them in twos, that was traditional, but now there seemed to be a third one, and he was blowed if he could think of any funny lines for him.\\n\\n His quill moved scratchily over the latest sheet of paper, trying to catch the voices that had streamed through his dreaming mind and had seemed so funny at the time.\\n\\n His tongue began to stick out of the corner of his mouth. He was sweating.\\n\\n This iss My Little Study, he wrote. Hey, with a Little Study youe could goe a Long Way. And I wishe youed start now. Iffe You can\u0027t leave yn a Cab then leave yn a Huff. Iffthates too soone, thenn leave yn a minute and a Huff. Say, have you Gott a Pensil? A crayon?—\\n\\n Hwel stared at this in horror. On the page it looked nonsensical, ridiculous. And yet, and yet, in the thronged auditorium of his mind . . .\\n\\n He dipped the quill in the inkpot, and chased the echoes further.\\n\\n Seconde Clown: Atsa right, Boss.\\n\\n Third Clowne: [businesse with bladder on stick] Honk. Honk.\\n\\n Hwel gave up. Yes, it was funny, he knew it was funny, he\u0027d heard the laughter in his dreams. But it wasn\u0027t right. Not yet. Maybe never. It was like the other idea about the two clowns, one fat, one thin . . . Thys ys amain Dainty Messe youe have got me into, Stanleigh . . . He had laughed until his chest ached, and the rest of the company had looked at him in astonishment. But in his dreams it was hilarious.\\n\\n He laid down the pen and rubbed his eyes. It must be nearly midnight, and the habit of a lifetime told him to spare the candles although, for a fact, they could afford all the candles they could eat now, whatever Vitoller might say.\\n\\n Hour gongs were being struck all across the city and nightwatchmen were proclaiming that it was indeed midnight and also that, in the face of all the evidence, all was well. Many of them got as far as the end of the sentence before being mugged.\\n\\n Hwel pushed open the shutters and looked out at Ankh-Morpork.\\n\\n It would be tempting to say the twin city was at its best this time of year, but that wouldn\u0027t be entirely correct. It was at its most typical.\\n\\n The river Ankh, the cloaca of half a continent, was already pretty wide and silt laden when it reached the city\u0027s outskirts. By the time it left it didn\u0027t so much flow as exude. Owing to the accretion of the mud of centuries the bed of the river was in fact higher than some of the low lying areas and now, with the snow melt swelling the flow, many of the low-rent districts on the Morpork side were flooded, if you can use that word for a liquid you could pick up in a net. This sort of thing happened every year and would have caused havoc with the drains and sewage systems, so it is just as well that the city didn\u0027t have very many. Its inhabitants merely kept a punt handy in the back yard and, periodically, built another storey on the house.\\n\\n It was reckoned to be very healthy there. Very few germs were able to survive.\\n\\n Hwel looked across a sort of misty sea in which buildings clustered like a sandcastle competition at high tide. Flares and lighted windows made pleasing patterns on the iridescent surface, but there was one glare of light, much closer to hand, which particularly occupied his attention.\\n\\n On a patch of slightly higher ground by the river, bought by Vitoller for a ruinous sum, a new building was rising. It was growing even by night, like a mushroom – Hwel could see the cressets burning all along the scaffolding as the hired craftsmen and even some of the players themselves refused to let the mere shade of the sky interrupt their labours.\\n\\n New buildings were rare in Morpork, but this was even a new type of building.\\n\\n The Dysk.\\n\\n Vitoller had been aghast at the idea at first, but young Tomjon had kept at him. And everyone knew that once the lad had got the feel of it he could persuade water to flow uphill.\\n\\n \u0027But we\u0027ve always moved around, laddie,\u0027 said Vitoller, in the desperate voice of one who knows that, at the end of it all, he\u0027s going to lose the argument. \u0027I can\u0027t go around settling down at my time of life.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s not doing you any good,\u0027 said Tomjon firmly. \u0027All these cold nights and frosty mornings. You\u0027re not getting any younger. We should stay put somewhere, and let people come to us. And they will, too. You know the crowds we\u0027re getting now. Hwel\u0027s plays are famous.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s not my plays,\u0027 Hwel had said. \u0027It\u0027s the players.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I can\u0027t see me sitting by a fire in a stuffy room and sleeping on feather beds and all that nonsense,\u0027 said Vitoller, but he\u0027d seen the look on his wife\u0027s face and had given in.\\n\\n And then there had been the theatre itself. Making water run uphill was a parlour trick compared to getting the cash out of Vitoller but, it was a fact, they had been doing well these days. Ever since Tomjon had been big enough to wear a ruff and say two words without his voice cracking.\\n\\n Hwel and Vitoller had watched the first few beams of the wooden framework go up.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s against nature,\u0027 Vitoller had complained, leaning on his stick. \u0027Capturing the spirit of the theatre, putting it in a cage. It\u0027ll kill it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, I don\u0027t know,\u0027 said Hwel diffidently. Tomjon had laid his plans well, he\u0027d devoted an entire evening to Hwel before even broaching the subject to his father, and now the dwarfs mind was on fire with the possibilities of backdrops and scenery changes and wings and flies and magnificent engines that could lower gods from the heavens and trapdoors that could raise demons from hell. Hwel was no more capable of objecting to the new theatre than a monkey was of resenting a banana plantation. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wyrd-sisters-discworld-6/page-26.html","bookId":1625,"book":{"id":1625,"title":"Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6)","description":"Storyline: Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6) \\n Witches are not by nature gregarious, and they certainly don\u0027t have leaders.
