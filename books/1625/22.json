{"id":95587,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"\u0027But,\u0027 the Fool continued, \u0027this policy has met with fanatical opposition.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027People don\u0027t like it.\u0027\\n\\n The duchess exploded. \u0027What does that matter?\u0027 she roared. \u0027We rule! They will do what we say or they will be pitilessly executed!\u0027\\n\\n The Fool bobbed and capered and waved his hands in a conciliatory fashion.\\n\\n \u0027But, my love, we will run out of people,\u0027 murmured the duke.\\n\\n \u0027No need, no need!\u0027 said the Fool desperately. \u0027You don\u0027t have to do that at all! What you do is, you—\u0027 he paused for a moment, his lips moving quickly – \u0027you embark upon a far-reaching and ambitious plan to expand the agricultural industry, provide long-term employment in the sawmills, open new land for development, and reduce the scope for banditry.\u0027\\n\\n This time the duke looked baffled. \u0027How will I do that?\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027Chop down the forests.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But you said—\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Shut up, Felmet,\u0027 said the duchess. She subjected the Fool to another long, thoughtful stare.\\n\\n \u0027Exactly how,\u0027 she said, eventually, \u0027does one go about knocking over the houses of people one does not like?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Urban clearance,\u0027 said the Fool.\\n\\n \u0027I was thinking of burning them down.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hygienic urban clearance,\u0027 the Fool added promptly.\\n\\n \u0027And sowing the ground with salt.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Marry, I suspect that is hygienic urban clearance and a programme of environmental improvements. It might be a good idea to plant a few trees as well.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No more trees!\u0027 shouted Felmet.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, it\u0027s all right. They won\u0027t survive. The important thing is to have planted them.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But I also want us to raise taxes,\u0027 said the duchess.\\n\\n \u0027Why, nuncle—\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And I am not your nuncle.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027N\u0027aunt?\u0027 said the Fool.\\n\\n \u0027No.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why . . . prithee . . . you need to finance your ambitious programme for the country.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sorry?\u0027 said the duke, who was getting lost again.\\n\\n \u0027He means that chopping down trees costs money,\u0027 said the duchess. She smiled at the Fool. It was the first time he had ever seen her look at him as if he was other than a disgusting little cockroach. There was still a large element of cockroach in her glance, but it said: good little cockroach, you have learned a trick.\\n\\n \u0027Intriguing,\u0027 she said. \u0027But can your words change the past?\u0027\\n\\n The Fool considered this.\\n\\n \u0027More easily, I think,\u0027 he said. \u0027Because the past is what people remember, and memories are words. Who knows how a king behaved a thousand years ago? There is only recollection, and stories. And plays, of course.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ah, yes. I saw a play once,\u0027 said Felmet. \u0027Bunch of funny fellows in tights. A lot of shouting. The people liked it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You tell me history is what people are told?\u0027 said the duchess.\\n\\n The Fool looked around the throne room and found King Gruneberry the Good (906-967).\\n\\n \u0027Was he?\u0027 he said, pointing. \u0027Who knows, now? What was he good at? But he will be Gruneberry the Good until the end of the world.\u0027\\n\\n The duke was leaning forward in his throne, his eyes gleaming.\\n\\n \u0027I want to be a good ruler,\u0027 he said. \u0027I want people to like me. I would like people to remember me fondly.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Let us assume,\u0027 said the duchess, \u0027that there were other matters, subject to controversy. Matters of historical record that had . . . been clouded.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I didn\u0027t do it, you know,\u0027 said the duke, quickly. \u0027He slipped and fell. That was it. Slipped and fell. I wasn\u0027t even there. He attacked me. It was self-defence. That\u0027s it. He slipped and fell on his own dagger in self-defence.\u0027 His voice fell to a mumble. \u0027I have no recollection of it at this time,\u0027 he murmured. He rubbed his dagger hand, although the word was becoming inappropriate.\\n\\n \u0027Be quiet, husband,\u0027 snapped the duchess. \u0027I know you didn\u0027t do it. I wasn\u0027t there with you, you may recall. It was I who didn\u0027t hand you the dagger.\u0027 The duke shuddered again.\\n\\n \u0027And now, Fool,\u0027 said Lady Felmet. \u0027I was saying, I believe, that perhaps there are matters that should be properly recorded.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Marry, that you were not there at the time?\u0027 said the Fool, brightly.\\n\\n It is true that words have power, and one of the things they are able to do is get out of someone\u0027s mouth before the speaker has the chance to stop them. If words were sweet little lambs, then the Fool watched them bound cheerfully away into the flamethrower of the duchess\u0027s glare.\\n\\n \u0027Not where?\u0027 she said.\\n\\n \u0027Anywhere,\u0027 said the Fool hastily.\\n\\n \u0027Stupid man! Everyone is somewhere.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I mean, you were everywhere but at the top of the stairs,\u0027 said the Fool.\\n\\n \u0027Which stairs?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Any stairs,\u0027 said the Fool, who was beginning to sweat. \u0027I distinctly remember not seeing you!\u0027\\n\\n The duchess eyed him for a while.\\n\\n \u0027So long as you remember it,\u0027 she said. The duchess rubbed her chin, which made an audible rasping noise.\\n\\n \u0027Reality is only weak words, you say. Therefore, words are reality. But how can words become history?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It was a very good play, the play that I saw,\u0027 said Felmet dreamily. \u0027There were fights, and no-one really died. Some very good speeches, I thought.\u0027\\n\\n There was another sandpapery sound from the duchess.\\n\\n \u0027Fool?\u0027 she said.\\n\\n \u0027Lady?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Can you write a play? A play that will go around the world, a play that will be remembered long after rumour has died?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, lady. It is a special talent.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But can you find someone who has it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There are such people, lady.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Find one,\u0027 murmured the duke. \u0027Find the best. Find the best. The truth will out. Find one.\u0027\\n\\n The storm was resting. It didn\u0027t want to be, but it was. It had spent a fortnight understudying a famous anticyclone over the Circle Sea, turning up every day, hanging around in the cold front, grateful for a chance to uproot the occasional tree or whirl a farmhouse to any available emerald city of its choice. But the big break in the weather had never come.\\n\\n It consoled itself with the thought that even the really great storms of the past – the Great Gale of 1789, for example, or Hurricane Zelda and Her Amazing Raining Frogs – had gone through this sort of thing at some stage in their career. It was just part of the great tradition of the weather.\\n\\n Besides, it had had a good stretch in the equivalent of pantomime down on the plains, bringing seasonal snow and terminal frostbite to millions. It just had to be philosophical about being back up here now with nothing much to do except wave the heather about. If weather was people, this storm would be filling in time wearing a cardboard hat in a hamburger hell.\\n\\n Currently it was observing three figures moving slowly over the moor, converging with some determination on a bare patch where the standing stone stood, or usually stood, though just at the moment it wasn\u0027t visible.\\n\\n It recognised them as old friends and connoisseurs, and conjured up a brief unseasonal roll of thunder as a form of greeting. This was totally ignored.\\n\\n \u0027The bloody stone\u0027s gone,\u0027 said Granny Weatherwax. \u0027However many there is of it.\u0027\\n\\n Her face was pale. It might also have been drawn; if so, then it was by a very neurotic artist. She looked as though she meant business. Bad business.\\n\\n \u0027Light the fire, Magrat,\u0027 she added automatically.\\n\\n \u0027I daresay we\u0027ll all feel better for a cup of tea,\u0027 said Nanny Ogg, mouthing the words like a mantra. She fumbled in the recesses of her shawl. \u0027With something in it,\u0027 she added, producing a small bottle of applejack.\\n\\n \u0027Alcohol is a deceiver and tarnishes the soul,\u0027 said Magrat virtuously.\\n\\n \u0027I never touch the stuff,\u0027 said Granny Weatherwax. \u0027We should keep a clear head, Gytha.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Just a drop in your tea isn\u0027t drinking,\u0027 said Nanny. \u0027It\u0027s medicine. It\u0027s a chilly old wind up here, sisters.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Very well,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027But just a drop.\u0027\\n\\n They drank in silence. Eventually Granny said, \u0027Well, Magrat. You know all about the coven business. We might as well do it right. What do we do next?\u0027\\n\\n Magrat hesitated. She wasn\u0027t up to suggesting dancing naked.\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s a song,\u0027 she said. \u0027In praise of the full moon.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It ain\u0027t full,\u0027 Granny pointed out. \u0027It\u0027s wossname. Bulging.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Gibbous,\u0027 said Nanny obligingly.\\n\\n \u0027I think it\u0027s in praise of full moons in general,\u0027 Magrat hazarded. \u0027And then we have to raise our consciousness. It really ought to be full moon for that, I\u0027m afraid. Moons are very important.\u0027\\n\\n Granny gave her a long, calculating look.\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s modern witchcraft for you, is it?\u0027 she said.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s part of it, Granny. There\u0027s a lot more.\u0027\\n\\n Granny Weatherwax sighed. \u0027Each to her own, I suppose. I\u0027m blowed if I\u0027ll let a ball of shiny rock tell me what to do.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, bugger all that,\u0027 said Nanny. \u0027Let\u0027s curse somebody.\u0027\\n\\n The Fool crept cautiously along the nighttime corridors. He wasn\u0027t taking any chances either. Magrat had given him a graphic account of Greebo\u0027s general disposition, and the Fool had borrowed a couple of gloves and a sort of metal wimple from the castle\u0027s store of hereditary chain mail.\\n\\n He reached the lumber room, lifted the latch cautiously, pushed the door and then flung himself against the wall.\\n\\n The corridor became slightly darker as the more intense darkness inside the room spilled out and mingled with the rather lighter darkness already there.\\n\\n Apart from that, nothing. The number of spitting, enraged balls of murderous fur pouring through the door was zero. The Fool relaxed, and slipped inside.\\n\\n Greebo dropped on his head.\\n\\n It had been a long day. The room did not offer the kind of full life that Greebo had come to expect and demand. The only point of interest had been the discovery, around mid-morning, of a colony of mice who had spent generations eating their way through a priceless tapestry history of Lancre and had just got as far as King Murune (709-745), who met a terrible fate[14], when they did, too. He had sharpened his claws on a bust of Lancre\u0027s only royal vampire, Queen Grimnir the Impaler (1514-1553, 1553-1557, 1557-1562, 1562-1567 and 1568-1573). He had performed his morning ablutions on a portrait of an unknown monarch, which was beginning to dissolve. Now he was bored, and also angry.\\n\\n He raked his claws across the place where the Fool\u0027s ears should have been, and was rewarded with nothing more than a metallic scraping noise.\\n\\n \u0027Who\u0027s a good boy, den?\u0027 said the Fool. \u0027Wowsa wowsa whoosh.\u0027\\n\\n This intrigued Greebo. The only other person who had ever spoken to him like this was Nanny Ogg; everyone else addressed him as \u0027Yarrgeroffoutofityahbarstard\u0027. He leaned down very carefully, intrigued by the new experience.\\n\\n From the Fool\u0027s point of view an upside-down cat face lowered itself slowly into his field of vision, wearing an expression of evil-eyed interest.\\n\\n \u0027Does oo want to go home, den?\u0027 said the Fool hopefully. \u0027Look, Mr Door is open.\u0027\\n\\n Greebo increased his grip. He had found a friend.\\n\\n The Fool shrugged, very carefully, turned, and walked back into the passage. He made his way down through the hall, out into the courtyard, around the side of the guardroom and out through the main gate, nodding – carefully – to the guards.\\n\\n \u0027Man just went past with a cat on his head,\u0027 one of them remarked, after a minute or two\u0027s reflection.\\n\\n \u0027See who it was?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The Fool, I think.\u0027\\n\\n There was a thoughtful pause. The second guard shifted his grip on his halberd.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s a rotten job,\u0027 he said. \u0027But I suppose someone\u0027s got to do it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We ain\u0027t going to curse anyone,\u0027 said Granny firmly. \u0027It hardly ever works if they don\u0027t know you\u0027ve done it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What you do is, you send him a doll of himself with pins in.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, Gytha.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All you have to do is get hold of some of his toenails,\u0027 Nanny persisted, enthusiastically.\\n\\n \u0027No.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Or some of his hair or anything. I\u0027ve got some pins.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Cursing people is morally unsound and extremely bad for your karma,\u0027 said Magrat. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wyrd-sisters-discworld-6/page-22.html","bookId":1625,"book":{"id":1625,"title":"Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6)","description":"Storyline: Wyrd Sisters (Discworld #6) \\n Witches are not by nature gregarious, and they certainly don\u0027t have leaders.
