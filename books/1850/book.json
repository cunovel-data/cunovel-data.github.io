He\u0027s hot, he\u0027s sexy, and what started as a no-names-exchanged night of passion has blossomed into a year and a half-long pleasure fest. Sure, it\u0027s a little strange that he only appears in her bed at night, but Gwen is so sure he\u0027s the one, she just can\u0027t turn him away... \n Hawk Delgado knows more about Gwen than she could ever imagine. She\u0027s gorgeous, headstrong, and skittish about relationships. But Hawk is facing his own demons, demons that keep him from connecting with anyone. Yet when Gwen is drawn into Denver\u0027s lethal underground scene, Hawk\u0027s protective nature comes out full force. The problem is, when Gwen gets a dose of Hawk\u0027s Alpha attitude in the daylight, she\u0027s not so sure he\u0027s the one anymore...\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/mystery-man-dream-man-1.jpg","author":"Kristen Ashley","type":"Young Adult","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":114,"category":{"id":9,"name":"Young Adult","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
