Then he’d f**ked around for a year and a half. A year and a half. Every night he left her he told himself he’d never go back and then every night he fought going back until he couldn’t fight it anymore and he had to taste her, touch her, hear her soft, sweet voice whisper “baby”, feel her limbs hold him tight after he made her come, feel her eyes on him while he dressed and struggled with climbing right back into her bed and holding her close until he could see the sun shine on her beautiful face.\n He’d had her in his arms and he had no idea he was in her heart and he’d denied she’d touched his for a year and a f**king half.\n He’d never get that back and now he knew exactly what he’d been missing and he’d never f**king get that back.\n “Mr. Delgado?” he heard and he opened his eyes to turn and see a doctor in scrubs walking into the room.\n Everyone but Tracy and Elvira stood. Tracy because she was cradling a sleeping Ash, Elvira because she was doing the same with Bruno.\n Hawk didn’t move as he watched Dr. Hunter walk to him and he still didn’t move even when he saw the man’s smile.\n “Your wife is fine,” Hunter stated then stopped a foot from Hawk before he finished, “As is your baby girl.”\n “A girl?” Hawk heard his mother cry as he heard other noises of relief and joy.\n He just stared at Hunter and demanded, “I want to see my wife.”\n “Of course,” Hunter nodded. “She’s sleeping,” he went on to warn.\n “I want to see my wife,” Hawk repeated.\n Hunter nodded again. “Follow me.”\n Hawk’s eyes scanned his sleeping sons but didn’t move to anyone else in the room as he followed the doctor.\n He saw it the minute her eyes opened.\n She looked confused a moment then his hand in hers squeezed and her head turned on the pillow.\n “Cabe, baby,” she whispered.\n He felt her words like a physical touch.\n Then he felt her hand squeeze his and his thumb slipped, brushing across her wedding rings.\n He closed his eyes.\n Thank Christ. Thank f**king Christ.\n Hawk opened his eyes. “We’re namin’ her Genevieve.”\n He watched her eyes grow round.\n “Genevieve?” she whispered.\n “Yeah,” he whispered back.\n She stared at him. Then, still whispering, she declared, “Vivi.”\n “Whatever,” Hawk muttered.\n Gwen smiled at him and, seeing it, his hand automatically tightened around hers.\n Thank. Fucking. Christ.\n “No more kids,” he proclaimed.\n “’Kay,” she agreed softly.\n He got up from the chair but stayed bent so his face was close to hers.\n Then he admitted, “You scared the shit outta me, Sweet Pea.”\n Her eyes got soft and her face gentled. He’d surprised her in a way she liked.\n Fuck, but he loved that look and he didn’t love it any less no matter how often he saw it, which was often considering he worked hard to earn it.\n “Superheroes don’t get scared,” she told him and for the first time in hours, he felt his mouth smile. She smiled back. Then she asked, “Where are my boys?”\n “Sleepin’ in the waiting room.”\n “Can they come in?”\n “Don’t care, you want ‘em, I’ll go get ‘em.”\n “I want them,” she whispered.\n “You got it, babe,” Hawk whispered back, bent closer and touched his mouth to hers.\n When he pulled away her hand got tighter so he stopped and caught her eyes.\n “We have a little girl,” she said softly.\n “Yeah,” he replied just as soft.\n “Can I see her?”\n “I’ll bring her too.”\n Gwen nodded and studied his face for awhile.\n Then she asked quietly, “What am I going to do?”\n “What?”\n “I don’t have anything else to daydream about. Now what am I going to do?”\n Hawk felt his gut get tight, his chest swell and something stung his throat.\n “I’ll find a way to keep you occupied, baby,” he whispered.\n “’Kay,” she whispered back.\n His hand again tightened in hers and his other hand lifted so he could run his knuckles down her pale cheek and when he did, her eyes closed.\n “Love you, Sweet Pea,” he murmured and her eyes opened.\n She smiled then she replied, “Love you too, baby.” He started to pull away again but she called his name so he stopped.\n “Yeah?”\n “Before you go, give me the dimples,” she demanded.\n That thing in his throat prickled and Hawk dipped his head and kissed the indentation at the base of his wife’s throat. Then he lifted his head and smiled at her.\n Her hand came to his face and he felt the pad of her thumb in one of his dimples.\n Then her eyes moved from her thumb to his and she smiled back. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mystery-man-dream-man-1/page-114.html","bookId":1850,"book":{"id":1850,"title":"Mystery Man (Dream Man #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Night time is the right time... \n Gwendolyn Kidd has met the man of her dreams.
