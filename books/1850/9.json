And I know you do not wanna go there. Rumor is he’s spent his term tryin’ to clean up the club, with some success, but clean for those boys does not have the same definition as it does for the rest of the population. They call themselves Chaos for a reason and these boys are not like other boys. These boys do not have the civilized filter other people do. They do not only not exist in a world of law and order, they exist in a world of survival where there is only instinct. They’re animals, Gwen. No freakin’ joke.”\\n\\n Oh boy.\\n\\n “Well, I didn’t exactly make a date with him,” I reminded her.\\n\\n “And don’t, ever. You enter that world, there is no comin’ home. You get me?”\\n\\n Yikes.\\n\\n “He was scary, Cam, I’m not going there,” I assured her.\\n\\n “God, I hope not,” she said in a way that meant she didn’t believe me. Then again, I’d met her in the middle of my divorce mess so she knew all about Scott, who was hot but who was a complete dick. And she also knew about MM, who was also hot, way hotter than Scott, and was proving to be of the Scott bent, namely a jerk.\\n\\n “I’ll talk to Leo, see what I can get about your sister,” Cam went on. “The one thing I can say about MM is that he gave you good advice. You need to lay low. Ginger is Ginger and she’s been headin’ down a path that’s leadin’ her to big trouble and seems she found it.” I listened to her take a big breath and I knew what that big breath meant. She had something to say she knew I wouldn’t like. Camille was a straight-talker but that didn’t mean she didn’t have a kind soul. She did. The kindest there was. Therefore when she continued, she did it gently. “I know she’s your sister, girl, but Ginger Kidd, she doesn’t care who she brings down with her and she’ll throw up anyone as a shield to protect her skinny, white ass. She’s in trouble and she gets a hint that she can use you, however she could use you, she’s gonna do it, babe. No hesitation.”\\n\\n This was definitely true.\\n\\n “I am, as of this moment, officially disowning her,” I declared.\\n\\n “Finally,” Cam muttered.\\n\\n “Call me after you talk to Leo,” I told her.\\n\\n “Gwen?” she called.\\n\\n “Yeah, babe,” I replied.\\n\\n “I’m also gonna talk to him about MM.”\\n\\n Oh No. Hell no. Dad and Meredith didn’t know about MM. Troy didn’t know about MM. And Leonard Freeman didn’t know about MM. The only people who knew about MM were Camille and Tracy and I’d sworn them to secrecy.\\n\\n This said a lot about me and how I felt about MM, namely that I was ashamed of what I was doing and also why I was doing it. It more than hinted at desperate and slut, two things no girl should be. Ever. I loved Dad, Meredith, Troy and Leo. I did not want these people to think I was a desperate slut.\\n\\n “Gwen –” Cam started.\\n\\n “No, Cam, no. Do not talk to Leo about The Great MM,” I stated firmly.\\n\\n “Okay, girl, listen to me,” she stated firmly back. “This guy can walk through doors. This guy has the means to investigate you and keep tabs. I know that now so now I know this guy has got to be on the grid and if he’s on the grid, Leo can get a lock on him.”\\n\\n “Maybe so but I don’t want Leo to get a lock on him.”\\n\\n “Why?” she asked, beginning to sound impatient. “He investigated you.”\\n\\n “That may be so too but as of today I am officially disowning my sister and officially ending my screwed up, non-relationship with The Great Mystery Man. It’s over. Totally over.”\\n\\n Again, silence.\\n\\n Then, “Seriously?”\\n\\n “Seriously, Cam!” I cried. “I told you how he spoke to me. I told you what he said about our relationship. He investigated me. He knows everything about me. He says only he gets to end things. He wouldn’t tell me his name. That situation was totally whacked before in a way I didn’t think it could get more whacked and now that it has, wake up call. It’s over.”\\n\\n Again, silence then, “I hope so, girl. I said it before and I’ll say it again. There are hot guys out there who are not motherfucking ass**les. They do not use you to get off. There are men out there who know how to treat a woman right and you’re gonna find one, babe, but the only way you can do that is to scrape off the one who doesn’t treat you right.”\\n\\n There it was, Camille Antoine, straight-talker. And Camille Antoine, smart girl who had her head screwed on right.\\n\\n “Well, today has been the day of epiphany. Ginger and The Great MM are history,” I declared grandly.\\n\\n “Hallelujah,” Cam replied.\\n\\n Ten minutes later, we hung up. After that, I sat at my table, spooned up dough, ate it and stared at my phone, hoping that I could follow through with my grand statement.\\n\\n Then I picked up the phone and called Tracy.\\n\\n Chapter Four\\n\\n Baseball Bat or Crowbar\\n\\n I heard the crash and jerked awake, instant adrenalin pumping through my body making my skin and fingers tingle.\\n\\n Someone was in my house.\\n\\n I listened and heard not a sound but I knew. I knew.\\n\\n The Great MM didn’t make noise. Even if I moved something or work was being done on the house, he avoided it and moved silently like he could see any obstacles in the dark.\\n\\n He did not make a crash. He’d never make a crash.\\n\\n I turned to reach to the phone and wished I had a weapon. Even a baseball bat. Something that would make me feel less powerless. Less alone. I was happy for the company of an inanimate object if it could inflict injury.\\n\\n I grabbed the phone and dialed 911.\\n\\n “Nine, one, one, what’s your emergency?”\\n\\n “My name is Gwendolyn Kidd,” I whispered. “I live at three, three, two Vine and someone has broken into my house. They’re here, in the house. Send someone. I’m hanging up now and don’t call back. This is not a prank.”\\n\\n I beeped off the phone, dropped it on the bed and rolled the other way, in the direction of my snow globe. I loved that snow globe. It was a Rosina Wachtmeister snow globe with a happy kitty in it, little flowers dancing around the base and if you turned it over and shook it, glitter danced around the kitty.\\n\\n And, if I used it to clock someone on the head, they might not be able to rape me. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mystery-man-dream-man-1/page-9.html","bookId":1850,"book":{"id":1850,"title":"Mystery Man (Dream Man #1)","description":"Storyline: Night time is the right time... \\n Gwendolyn Kidd has met the man of her dreams.
