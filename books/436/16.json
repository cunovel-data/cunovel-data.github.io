{"id":14281,"no":16,"title":"CHAPTER XV. THE ROOM UNDER THE WHARF.","content":"It was at a late hour when the boys left the theatre. The play had been of a highly sensational character, and had been greeted with enthusiastic applause on the part of the audience, particularly the occupants of the \"pit.\" Now, as they emerged from the portals of the theatre, various characteristic remarks of a commendatory character were interchanged. \"How\u0027d you like it, Ben?\" asked Barney. \"Bully,\" said Ben. \"I liked the fight best,\" said Barney. \"Jones give it to him just about right.\" \"Yes, that was good,\" said Ben; \"but I liked it best where Alphonso says to Montmorency, \u0027Caitiff, beware, or, by the heavens above, my trusty sword shall drink thy foul heart\u0027s blood!\u0027\"[Pg 169] Ben gave this with the stage emphasis, so far as he could imitate it. Barney listened admiringly. \"I say, Ben,\" he replied, \"you did that bully. You\u0027d make a tip-top actor.\" \"Would I?\" said Ben, complacently. \"I think I\u0027d like to try it if I knew enough. How much money have you got, Barney?\" \"Nary a red. I spent the last on peanuts.\" \"Just my case. We\u0027ll have to find some place to turn in for the night.\" \"I know a place,\" said Barney, \"if they\u0027ll let us in.\" \"Whereabouts is it?\" \"Down to Dover Street wharf.\" \"What sort of a place is it? There aint any boxes or old wagons, are there?\" \"No, it\u0027s under the wharf,—a bully place.\" \"Under the wharf! It\u0027s wet, isn\u0027t it?\" \"No, you just come along. I\u0027ll show you.\" Having no other place to suggest, Ben accepted his companion\u0027s guidance, and the two made their way by the shortest route to the wharf named. It is situated not far from Fulton Ferry on the east side. It may be called a double wharf. As originally built,[Pg 170] it was found too low for the class of vessels that used it, and another flooring was built over the first, leaving a considerable space between the two. Its capabilities for a private rendezvous occurred to a few boys, who forthwith proceeded to avail themselves of it. It was necessary to carry on their proceedings secretly; otherwise there was danger of interference from the city police. What steps they took to make their quarters comfortable will shortly be described. When they reached the wharf, Barney looked about him with an air of caution, which Ben observed. \"What are you scared of?\" asked Ben. \"We mustn\u0027t let the \u0027copp\u0027 see us,\" said Barney, \"Don\u0027t make no noise.\" Thus admonished, Ben followed his companion with as little noise as possible. \"How do you get down there?\" he asked. \"I\u0027ll show you,\" said Barney. He went to the end of the wharf, and, motioning Ben to look over, showed him a kind of ladder formed by nailing strips of wood, at regular intervals, from the outer edge down to the water\u0027s edge. This[Pg 171] was not an arrangement of the boys, but was for the accommodation of river-boats landing at the wharf. \"I\u0027ll go down first,\" whispered Barney. \"If the \u0027copp\u0027 comes along, move off, so he won\u0027t notice nothin\u0027.\" \"All right!\" said Ben. Barney got part way down the ladder, when a head was protruded from below, and a voice demanded, \"Who\u0027s there?\" \"It\u0027s I,—Barney Flynn.\" \"Come along, then.\" \"I\u0027ve got a fellow with me,\" continued Barney. \"Who is it?\" \"It\u0027s Ben, the baggage-smasher. He wants to stop here to-night.\" \"All right; we can trust him.\" \"Come along, Ben,\" Barney called up the ladder. Ben quickly commenced the descent. Barney was waiting for him, and held out his hand to help him off. Our hero stepped from the ladder upon the lower flooring of the wharf, and looked about him with some curiosity. It was certainly a singular spectacle that met his view. About a dozen boys[Pg 172] were congregated in the room under the wharf, and had evidently taken some pains to make themselves comfortable. A carpet of good size was spread over a portion of the flooring. Upon this three beds were spread, each occupied by three boys. Those who could not be accommodated in this way laid on the carpet. Some of the boys were already asleep; two were smoking, and conversing in a low voice. Looking about him Ben recognized acquaintances in several of them.[A] \"Is that you, Mike Sweeny?\" he asked of a boy stretched out on the nearest bed. \"Yes,\" said Mike; \"come and lay alongside of me.\" There was no room on the bed, but Ben found space beside it on the carpet, and accordingly stretched himself out. [A] The description of the room under the wharf, and the circumstances of its occupation by a company of street boys, are not imaginary. It was finally discovered, and broken up by the police, the details being given, at the time, in the daily papers, as some of my New York readers will remember. Discovery did not take place, however, until it had been occupied some time.[Pg 173] \"How do you like it?\" asked Mike. \"Tip-top,\" said Ben. \"How\u0027d you get the carpet and beds? Did you buy \u0027em?\" \"Yes,\" said Mike, with a wink; \"but the man wasn\u0027t in, and we didn\u0027t pay for \u0027em.\" \"You stole them, then?\" \"We took \u0027em,\" said Mike, who had an objection to the word stole. \"How did you get them down here without the copp seein\u0027 you?\" \"We hid \u0027em away in the daytime, and didn\u0027t bring \u0027em here till night. We came near gettin\u0027 caught.\" \"How long have you been down here?\" \"Most a month.\" \"It\u0027s a good place.\" \"Yes,\" said Mike, \"and the rent is very reasonable. We don\u0027t have to pay nothin\u0027 for lodgin\u0027. It\u0027s cheaper\u0027n the Lodge.\" \"That\u0027s so,\" said Ben. \"I\u0027m sleepy,\" he said, gaping. \"I\u0027ve been to the Old Bowery to-night. Good-night!\"[Pg 174] \"Good-night!\" In five minutes Ben was fast asleep. Half an hour later, and not a sound was heard in the room under the wharf except the occasional deep breathing of some of the boys. The policeman who trod his beat near by little suspected that just at hand, and almost under his feet, was a rendezvous of street vagrants and juvenile thieves, for such I am sorry to say was the character of some of the boys who frequented these cheap lodgings. In addition to the articles already described there were two or three chairs, which had been contributed by different members of the organization. Ben slept soundly through the night. When he woke up, the gray morning light entering from the open front towards the sea had already lighted up indistinctly the space between the floors. Two or three of the boys were already sitting up, yawning and stretching themselves after their night\u0027s slumber. Among these was Mike Sweeny. \"Are you awake, Ben?\" he asked. \"Yes,\" said Ben; \"I didn\u0027t hardly know where I was at first.\"[Pg 175] \"It\u0027s a bully place, isn\u0027t it?\" \"That\u0027s so. How\u0027d you come across it?\" \"Oh, some of us boys found it out. We\u0027ve been sleepin\u0027 here a month.\" \"Won\u0027t you let a feller in?\" \"We might let you in. I\u0027ll speak to the boys.\" \"I\u0027d like to sleep here,\" said Ben. \"It\u0027s a good deal better than sleepin\u0027 out round. Who runs the hotel?\" \"Well, I\u0027m one of \u0027em.\" \"You might call it Sweeny\u0027s Hotel,\" suggested Ben, laughing. \"I aint the boss; Jim Bagley\u0027s got most to do with it.\" \"Which is he?\" \"That\u0027s he, over on the next bed.\" \"What does he do?\" \"He\u0027s a travellin\u0027 match merchant.\" \"That sounds big.\" \"Jim\u0027s smart,—he is. He makes more money\u0027n any of us.\" \"Where does he travel?\" \"Once he went to Californy in the steamer. He[Pg 176] got a steerage ticket for seventy-five dollars; but he made more\u0027n that blackin\u0027 boots for the other passengers afore they got there. He stayed there three months, and then came home.\" \"Does he travel now?\" \"Yes, he buys a lot of matches, and goes up the river or down into Jersey, and is gone a week. A little while ago he went to Buffalo.\" \"Oh, yes; I know where that is.\" \"Blest if I do.\" \"It\u0027s in the western part of York State, just across from Canada.\" \"Who told you?\" \"I learned it in school.\" \"I didn\u0027t know you was a scholar, Ben.\" \"I aint now. I\u0027ve forgot most all I ever knew. I haven\u0027t been to school since I was ten years old.\" \"Where was that?\" \"In the country.\" \"Well, I never went to school more\u0027n a few weeks. I can read a little, but not much.\" \"It costs a good deal to go to Buffalo. How did Jim make it while he was gone?\"[Pg 177] \"Oh, he came home with ten dollars in his pocket besides payin\u0027 his expenses.\" \"What does Jim do with all his money?\" \"He\u0027s got a mother and sister up in Bleecker Street, or somewheres round there. He pays his mother five dollars a week, besides takin\u0027 care of himself.\" \"Why don\u0027t he live with his mother?\" \"He\u0027d rather be round with the boys.\" I may remark here that Jim Bagley is a real character, and all that has been said about him is derived from information given by himself, in a conversation held with him at the Newsboys\u0027 Lodging House. He figures here, however, under an assumed name, partly because the record in which his real name is preserved has been mislaid. The impression made upon the mind of the writer was, that Jim had unusual business ability and self-reliance, and might possibly develop into a successful and prosperous man of business. Jim by this time was awake. \"Jim Bagley,\" said Mike, \"here\u0027s a feller would like to put up at our hotel.\"[Pg 178] \"Who is he?\" asked Jim. The travelling match merchant, as Mike had described him, was a boy of fifteen, rather small of his age, with a keen black eye, and a quick, decided, business-like way. \"It\u0027s this feller,—he\u0027s a baggage-smasher,\" explained Mike. \"All right,\" said Jim; \"he can come if he\u0027ll pay his share.\" \"How much is it?\" asked Ben. Mike explained that it was expected of each guest to bring something that would add to the comforts of the rendezvous. Two boys had contributed the carpet, for which probably they had paid nothing; Jim had supplied a bed, for which he did pay, as \"taking things without leave\" was not in his line. Three boys had each contributed a chair. Thus all the articles which had been accumulated were individual contributions. Ben promised to pay his admission fee in the same way, but expressed a doubt whether he might not have to wait a few days, in order to save money enough to make a purchase. He never stole himself, though his association with street boys,[Pg 179] whose principles are not always very strict on this point, had accustomed him to regard theft as a venial fault, provided it was not found out. For his own part, however, he did not care to run the risk of detection. Though he had cut himself off from his old home, he still felt that he should not like to have the report reach home that he had been convicted of dishonesty. At an early hour the boys shook off their slumbers, and one by one left the wharf to enter upon their daily work. The newsboys were the first to go, as they must be on hand at the newspaper offices early to get their supply of papers, and fold them in readiness for early customers. The boot-blacks soon followed, as most of them were under the necessity of earning their breakfast before they ate it. Ben also got up early, and made his way to the pier of the Stonington line of steamers from Boston. These usually arrived at an early hour, and there was a good chance of a job in Ben\u0027s line when the passengers landed. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2953/81204.html","bookId":436,"book":{"id":436,"title":"Ben, the Luggage Boy; or, Among the Wharves","description":"简介： In presenting Ben, the Luggage Boy, to the public, as the fifth of the Ragged Dick Series, the author desires to say that it is in all essential points a true history; the particulars of the story having been communicated to him, by Ben himself, near...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2953","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
