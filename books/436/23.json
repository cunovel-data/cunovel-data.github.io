{"id":14288,"no":23,"title":"CHAPTER XXII. THE HEAVY VALISE.","content":"Ben had sold half his papers when the arrival of the train from Philadelphia gave him an opportunity to return to his legitimate calling. \"Smash your baggage, sir?\" asked Ben of a dark-complexioned man of thirty-five, who carried a moderate-sized valise. \"Yes,\" said the other. \"Where shall I carry it?\" \"To——\" Here the man hesitated, and finally answered, \"There is no need of telling you. I will take it from you when we have got along far enough.\" Ben was about to walk beside the owner of the valise; but the latter objected to this. \"You needn\u0027t walk beside me,\" he said. \"Keep about a block ahead.\"[Pg 247] \"But how will I know where to go?\" asked Ben, naturally. \"You know where Broome Street runs into the Bowery?\" \"Of course I do.\" \"Go there by the shortest route. Don\u0027t trouble yourself about me. I\u0027ll follow along behind, and take the valise from you there. If you get there before I do, wait for me.\" \"I suppose I\u0027m too ragged to walk alongside of him,\" thought Ben. He could think of no other reason for the direction given by the other. However, Ben\u0027s pride was not very much hurt. Although he was ragged now, he did not mean to be long. The time would come, he was confident, when he could lay aside his rags, and appear in a respectable dress. The valise which he carried proved to be considerably heavier than would have been imagined from its size. \"I wonder what\u0027s in it,\" thought Ben, who found it tugging away at his arms. \"If it\u0027s shirts they\u0027re cast-iron. Maybe they\u0027re just comin\u0027 in fashion.\"[Pg 248] However, he did not perplex himself much about this point. Beyond a momentary curiosity, he felt no particular interest in the contents of the valise. The way in which it affected him principally was, to make him inwardly resolve to ask an extra price, on account of the extra weight. After walking a while he looked back for the owner of the valise. But he was not in sight. \"I might carry off his baggage,\" thought Ben, \"without his knowin\u0027 it.\" He kept on, however, never doubting that the owner would sooner or later overtake him. If he did not care enough for the valise to do this, Ben would not be responsible. He had just shifted the heavy burden from one hand to the other, when he felt himself tapped on the shoulder. Looking round, he saw that the one who had done this was a quiet-looking man, of middle size, but with a keen, sharp eye. \"What\u0027s wanted?\" asked Ben. \"Where did you get that valise, my lad?\" asked the new-comer. \"I don\u0027t know as that\u0027s any of your business,\"[Pg 249] answered Ben, who didn\u0027t perceive the other\u0027s right to ask the question. \"Is it yours?\" \"Maybe it is.\" \"Let me lift it a moment.\" \"Hands off!\" said Ben, suspiciously. \"Don\u0027t try none of your tricks on me.\" The other did not appear to notice this. \"I take it for granted that the valise is not yours,\" he said. \"Now tell me where you got it from.\" There was something of authority in his manner, which led Ben to think that he had a warrant for asking the question, though he could not guess his object in doing so. \"I\u0027m a baggage-smasher,\" answered Ben. \"I got this from a man that came by the Philadelphia train.\" \"Where is he?\" \"I guess he\u0027s behind somewheres.\" \"Where are you carrying the valise?\" \"Seems to me you want to know a good deal,\" said Ben, undecided as to the right of the other to ask so many questions.[Pg 250] \"I\u0027ll let you into a secret, my lad; but you must keep the secret. That valise is pretty heavy, isn\u0027t it?\" \"I\u0027ll bet it is.\" \"To the best of my information, the man who employed you is a noted burglar, and this valise contains his tools. I am a detective, and am on his track. I received a telegram an hour ago from Philadelphia, informing me that he was on his way. I got down to the wharf a little too late. Now tell me where you are to carry this;\" and the detective pointed to the valise. \"I am to meet the gentleman at the corner of Broome Street and the Bowery,\" said Ben. \"Very well. Go ahead and meet him.\" \"Shall you be there?\" asked Ben. \"Never mind. Go on just as if I had not met you, and deliver up the valise.\" \"If you\u0027re goin\u0027 to nab him, just wait till I\u0027ve got my pay. I don\u0027t want to smash such heavy baggage for nothin\u0027.\" \"I agree to that. Moreover, if I succeed in getting hold of the fellow through your information, I[Pg 251] don\u0027t mind paying you five dollars out of my own pocket.\" \"Very good,\" said Ben. \"I shan\u0027t mind takin\u0027 it, not by no means.\" \"Go on, and don\u0027t be in too much of a hurry. I want time to lay my trap.\" Ben walked along leisurely, in accordance with his instructions. At length he reached the rendezvous. He found the owner of the valise already in waiting. \"Well, boy,\" he said, impatiently, \"you took your time.\" \"I generally do,\" said Ben. \"It aint dishonest to take my own time, is it?\" \"I\u0027ve been waiting here for a quarter of an hour. I didn\u0027t know but you\u0027d gone to sleep somewhere on the way.\" \"I don\u0027t sleep much in the daytime. It don\u0027t agree with my constitution. Well, mister, I hope you\u0027ll give me something handsome. Your baggage here is thunderin\u0027 heavy.\" \"There\u0027s twenty-five cents,\" said the other. \"Twenty-five cents!\" exclaimed Ben, indignantly.[Pg 252] \"Twenty-five cents for walkin\u0027 two miles with such a heavy load. It\u0027s worth fifty.\" \"Well, you won\u0027t get fifty,\" said the other, roughly. \"Just get somebody else to carry your baggage next time,\" said Ben, angrily. He looked round, and saw the quiet-looking man, before referred to, approaching. He felt some satisfaction in knowing that his recent employer would meet with a check which he was far from anticipating. Without answering Ben, the latter took the valise, and was about moving away, when the quiet-looking man suddenly quickened his pace, and laid his hand on his arm. The burglar, for he was really one, started, and turned pale. \"What do you want?\" \"You know what I want,\" said the detective, quietly. \"I want you.\" \"What do you want me for?\" demanded the other; but it was easy to see that he was nervous and alarmed. \"You know that also,\" said the detective; \"but[Pg 253] I don\u0027t mind telling you. You came from Philadelphia this morning, and your name is \u0027Sly Bill.\u0027 You are a noted burglar, and I shall take you into immediate custody.\" \"You\u0027re mistaken,\" said Bill. \"You\u0027ve got hold of the wrong man.\" \"That will soon be seen. Have the kindness to accompany me to the station-house, and I\u0027ll take a look into that valise of yours.\" Bill was physically a stronger man than the detective, but he succumbed at once to the tone of quiet authority with which he spoke, and prepared to follow, though by no means with alacrity. \"Here, my lad,\" said the detective, beckoning Ben, who came up. \"Come and see me at this place, to-morrow,\" he continued, producing a card, \"and I won\u0027t forget the promise I made you.\" \"All right,\" said Ben. \"I\u0027m in luck ag\u0027in,\" he said to himself. \"At this rate it won\u0027t take me long to make fifty dollars. Smashin\u0027 baggage for burglars pays pretty well.\" He bethought himself of his papers, of which half remained unsold. He sold some on the way back to[Pg 254] the wharf, where, after a while, he got another job, for which, being at some distance, he was paid fifty cents. At five in the afternoon he reported himself at the news-stand. \"I\u0027ve sold all the papers you gave me,\" he said, \"and here\u0027s the money. I guess I can sell more to-morrow.\" The news-dealer paid him the commission agreed upon, amounting to eighteen cents, Ben, of course, retaining besides the five cents which had been paid him extra in the morning. This made his earnings for the day ninety-eight cents, besides the dollars promised by the detective.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2953/81211.html","bookId":436,"book":{"id":436,"title":"Ben, the Luggage Boy; or, Among the Wharves","description":"简介： In presenting Ben, the Luggage Boy, to the public, as the fifth of the Ragged Dick Series, the author desires to say that it is in all essential points a true history; the particulars of the story having been communicated to him, by Ben himself, near...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2953","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
