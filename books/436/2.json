{"id":14267,"no":2,"title":"CHAPTER I. INTRODUCES BEN, THE LUGGAGE BOY.","content":"\"How much yer made this mornin\u0027, Ben?\" \"Nary red,\" answered Ben, composedly. \"Had yer breakfast?\" \"Only an apple. That\u0027s all I\u0027ve eaten since yesterday. It\u0027s most time for the train to be in from Philadelphy. I\u0027m layin\u0027 round for a job.\" The first speaker was a short, freckled-faced boy, whose box strapped to his back identified him at once as a street boot-black. His hair was red, his fingers defaced by stains of blacking, and his clothing constructed on the most approved system of ventilation. He appeared to be about twelve years old.[Pg 10] The boy whom he addressed as Ben was taller, and looked older. He was probably not far from sixteen. His face and hands, though browned by exposure to wind and weather, were several shades cleaner than those of his companion. His face, too, was of a less common type. It was easy to see that, if he had been well dressed, he might readily have been taken for a gentleman\u0027s son. But in his present attire there was little chance of this mistake being made. His pants, marked by a green stripe, small around the waist and very broad at the hips, had evidently once belonged to a Bowery swell; for the Bowery has its swells as well as Broadway, its more aristocratic neighbor. The vest had been discarded as a needless luxury, its place being partially supplied by a shirt of thick red flannel. This was covered by a frock-coat, which might once have belonged to a member of the Fat Men\u0027s Association, being aldermanic in its proportions. Now it was fallen from its high estate, its nap and original gloss had long departed, and it was frayed and torn in many places. But among the street-boys dress is not much regarded, and Ben never thought of apologizing for the defects of[Pg 11] his wardrobe. We shall learn in time what were his faults and what his virtues, for I can assure my readers that street boys do have virtues sometimes, and when they are thoroughly convinced that a questioner feels an interest in them will drop the \"chaff\" in which they commonly indulge, and talk seriously and feelingly of their faults and hardships. Some do this for a purpose, no doubt, and the verdant stranger is liable to be taken in by assumed virtue, and waste sympathy on those who do not deserve it. But there are also many boys who have good tendencies and aspirations, and only need to be encouraged and placed under right influences to develop into worthy and respectable men. The conversation recorded above took place at the foot of Cortlandt Street, opposite the ferry wharf. It was nearly time for the train, and there was the usual scene of confusion. Express wagons, hacks, boys, laborers, were gathering, presenting a confusing medley to the eye of one unaccustomed to the spectacle. Ben was a luggage boy, his occupation being to wait at the piers for the arrival of steamboats, or at the railway stations, on the chance of getting a carpet[Pg 12]-bag or valise to carry. His business was a precarious one. Sometimes he was lucky, sometimes unlucky. When he was flush, he treated himself to a \"square meal,\" and finished up the day at Tony Pastor\u0027s, or the Old Bowery, where from his seat in the pit he indulged in independent criticism of the acting, as he leaned back in his seat and munched peanuts, throwing the shells about carelessly. It is not surprising that the street-boys like the Old Bowery, and are willing to stint their stomachs, or run the risk of a night in the streets, for the sake of the warm room and the glittering illusions of the stage, introducing them for the time being to the society of nobles and ladies of high birth, and enabling them to forget for a time the hardships of their own lot, while they follow with rapt interest the fortunes of Lord Frederic Montressor or the Lady Imogene Delacour. Strange as it may seem, the street Arab has a decided fancy for these pictures of aristocracy, and never suspects their want of fidelity. When the play ends, and Lord Frederic comes to his own, having foiled all the schemes of his crafty and unprincipled enemies, no one rejoices more than the ragged[Pg 13] boy who has sat through the evening an interested spectator of the play, and in his pleasure at the successful denouement, he almost forgets that he will probably find the Newsboys\u0027 Lodging House closed for the night, and be compelled to take up with such sleeping accommodations as the street may provide. Ben crossed the street, taking a straight course, without paying especial attention to the mud, which caused other pedestrians to pick their way. To the condition of his shoes he was supremely indifferent. Stockings he did not wear. They are luxuries in which few street boys indulge. He had not long to wait. The boat bumped against the wharf, and directly a crowd of passengers poured through the open gates in a continuous stream. Ben looked sharply around him to judge who would be likely to employ him. His attention was drawn to an elderly lady, with a large carpet-bag swelled almost to bursting. She was looking about her in a bewildered manner. \"Carry your bag, ma\u0027am?\" he said, at the same time motioning towards it. \"Who be you?\" asked the old lady, suspiciously.[Pg 14] \"I\u0027m a baggage-smasher,\" said Ben. \"Then I don\u0027t want you,\" answered the old lady, clinging to her bag as if she feared it would be wrested from her. \"I\u0027m surprised that the law allows sich things. You might be in a better business, young man, than smashing baggage.\" \"That\u0027s where you\u0027re right, old lady,\" said Ben. \"Bankin\u0027 would pay better, if I only had the money to start on.\" \"Are you much acquainted in New York?\" asked the old lady. \"Yes,\" said Ben; \"I know the mayor \u0027n\u0027 aldermen, \u0027n\u0027 all the principal men. A. T. Stooart\u0027s my intimate friend, and I dine with Vanderbilt every Sunday when I aint engaged at Astor\u0027s.\" \"Do you wear them clo\u0027es when you visit your fine friends?\" asked the old lady, shrewdly. \"No,\" said Ben. \"Them are my every-day clo\u0027es. I\u0027ve got some velvet clo\u0027es to home, embroidered with gold.\" \"I believe you are telling fibs,\" said the old lady. \"What I want to know is, if you know my darter, Mrs. John Jones; her first name is Seraphiny. She[Pg 15] lives on Bleecker Street, and her husband, who is a nice man, though his head is bald on top, keeps a grocery store.\" \"Of course I do,\" said Ben. \"It was only yesterday that she told me her mother was comin\u0027 to see her. I might have knowed you was she.\" \"How would you have knowed?\" \"Cause she told me just how you looked.\" \"Did she? How did she say I looked?\" \"She said you was most ninety, and—\" \"It isn\u0027t true,\" said the old lady, indignantly. \"I\u0027m only seventy-three, and everybody says I\u0027m wonderful young-lookin\u0027 for my years. I don\u0027t believe Seraphiny told you so.\" \"She might have said you looked as if you was most ninety.\" \"You\u0027re a sassy boy!\" said the owner of the carpet-bag, indignantly. \"I don\u0027t see how I\u0027m going to get up to Seraphiny\u0027s,\" she continued, complainingly. \"They\u0027d ought to have come down to meet me. How much will you charge to carry my carpet-bag, and show me the way to my darter\u0027s?\" \"Fifty cents,\" said Ben.[Pg 16] \"Fifty cents!\" repeated the old lady, aghast. \"I didn\u0027t think you\u0027d charge more\u0027n ten.\" \"I have to,\" said Ben. \"Board\u0027s high in New York.\" \"How much would they charge me in a carriage? Here you, sir,\" addressing a hackman, \"what\u0027ll you charge to carry me to my darter\u0027s house, Mrs. John Jones, in Bleecker Street?\" \"What\u0027s the number?\" \"I think it\u0027s a hundred and sixty-three.\" \"A dollar and a half.\" \"A dollar \u0027n\u0027 a half? Couldn\u0027t you do it for less?\" \"Carry your bag, sir?\" asked Ben, of a gentleman passing. The gentleman shook his head. He made one or two other proposals, which being in like manner unsuccessful, he returned to the old lady, who, having by this time got through her negotiations with the hackman, whom she had vainly striven to beat down to seventy-five cents, was in a more favorable mood to accept Ben\u0027s services. \"Can\u0027t you take less than fifty cents?\" she asked.[Pg 17] \"No,\" said Ben, decidedly. \"I\u0027ll give you forty.\" \"Couldn\u0027t do it,\" said Ben, who felt sure of gaining his point now. \"Well, I suppose I shall be obleeged to hire you,\" said the old lady with a sigh. \"Seraphiny ought to have sent down to meet me. I didn\u0027t tell her I was comin\u0027 to-day; but she might have thought I\u0027d come, bein\u0027 so pleasant. Here, you boy, you may take the bag, and mind you don\u0027t run away with it. There aint nothin\u0027 in it but some of my clo\u0027es.\" \"I don\u0027t want none of your clo\u0027es,\" said Ben. \"My wife\u0027s bigger\u0027n you, and they wouldn\u0027t fit her.\" \"Massy sakes! you aint married, be you?\" \"Why shouldn\u0027t I be?\" \"I don\u0027t believe it. You\u0027re not old enough. But I\u0027m glad you don\u0027t want the clo\u0027es. They wouldn\u0027t be of no use to you. Just you take the bag, and I\u0027ll foller on behind.\" \"I want my pay first.\" \"I aint got the change. My darter Seraphiny will pay you when we get to her house.\"[Pg 18] \"That don\u0027t go down,\" said Ben, decidedly. \"Payment in advance; that\u0027s the way I do business.\" \"You\u0027ll get your pay; don\u0027t you be afraid.\" \"I know I shall; but I want it now.\" \"You won\u0027t run away after I\u0027ve paid you, will you?\" \"In course not. That aint my style.\" The old lady took out her purse, and drew therefrom forty-seven cents. She protested that she had not a cent more. Ben pardoned the deficiency, feeling that he would, notwithstanding, be well paid for his time. \"All right,\" said he, magnanimously. \"I don\u0027t mind the three cents. It aint any object to a man of my income. Take my hand, old lady, and we\u0027ll go across the street.\" \"I\u0027m afraid of bein\u0027 run over,\" said she, hesitatingly. \"What\u0027s the odds if you be?\" said Ben. \"The city\u0027ll have to pay you damages.\" \"But if I got killed, that wouldn\u0027t do me any good,\" remarked the old lady, sensibly.[Pg 19] \"Then the money\u0027d go to your friends,\" said Ben, consolingly. \"Do you think I will be run over?\" asked the old lady, anxiously. \"In course you won\u0027t. I\u0027ll take care of you. They wouldn\u0027t dare to run over me,\" said Ben, confidently. Somewhat reassured by this remark, the old lady submitted to Ben\u0027s guidance, and was piloted across the street in safety. \"I wouldn\u0027t live in New York for a heap of money. It would be as much as my life is worth,\" she remarked. \"How far is Bleecker Street?\" \"About two miles.\" \"I almost wish I\u0027d rid. But a dollar and a half is a sight to pay.\" \"You\u0027d have to pay more than that.\" \"That\u0027s all the man asked.\" \"I know,\" said Ben; \"but when he\u0027d got you there, he\u0027d have charged you five dollars.\" \"I wouldn\u0027t have paid it.\" \"Yes, you would,\" said Ben. \"He couldn\u0027t make me.\"[Pg 20] \"If you didn\u0027t pay, he\u0027d have locked you in, and driven you off to the river, and dumped you in.\" \"Do they ever do such things?\" asked the old lady, startled. \"In course they do. Only last week a beautiful young lady was served that way, \u0027cause she wouldn\u0027t pay what the hackman wanted.\" \"And what was done to him?\" \"Nothin\u0027,\" said Ben. \"The police is in league with \u0027em, and get their share of the money.\" \"Why, you don\u0027t say so! What a wicked place New York is, to be sure!\" \"Of course it is. It\u0027s so wicked I\u0027m goin\u0027 to the country myself as soon as I get money enough to buy a farm.\" \"Have you got much money saved up?\" asked the old lady, interested. \"Four thousand six hundred and seventy-seven dollars and fifty-five cents. I don\u0027t count this money you give me, \u0027cause I\u0027m goin\u0027 to spend it.\" \"You didn\u0027t make it all carryin\u0027 carpet-bags,\" said the old lady, incredulously.[Pg 21] \"No, I made most of it spekilatin\u0027 in real estate,\" said Ben. \"You don\u0027t say!\" \"Yes, I do.\" \"You\u0027ve got most enough to buy a farm a\u0027ready.\" \"I aint goin\u0027 to buy till I can buy a good one.\" \"What\u0027s the name of this street?\" \"West Broadway.\" They were really upon West Broadway by this time, that being as direct a line as any to Bleecker Street. \"You see that store,\" said Ben. \"Yes; what\u0027s the matter of it?\" \"I don\u0027t own it now,\" said Ben. \"I sold it, cos the tenants didn\u0027t pay their rent reg\u0027lar.\" \"I should think you\u0027d dress better if you\u0027ve got so much money,\" said the old lady, not unnaturally. \"What\u0027s the use of wearin\u0027 nice clo\u0027es round among the wharves?\" said Ben. \"There\u0027s suthin in that. I tell my darter Jane—she lives in the country—that it\u0027s no use dressin\u0027 up the children to go to school,—they\u0027re sure to get their clo\u0027es tore and dirty afore they get home.\"[Pg 22] So Ben beguiled the way with wonderful stories, with which he played upon the old lady\u0027s credulity. Of course it was wrong; but a street education is not very likely to inspire its pupils with a reverence for truth; and Ben had been knocking about the streets of New York, most of the time among the wharves, for six years. His street education had commenced at the age of ten. He had adopted it of his own free will. Even now there was a comfortable home waiting for him; there were parents who supposed him dead, and who would have found a difficulty in recognizing him under his present circumstances. In the next chapter a light will be thrown upon his past history, and the reader will learn how his street life began. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2953/81190.html","bookId":436,"book":{"id":436,"title":"Ben, the Luggage Boy; or, Among the Wharves","description":"简介： In presenting Ben, the Luggage Boy, to the public, as the fifth of the Ragged Dick Series, the author desires to say that it is in all essential points a true history; the particulars of the story having been communicated to him, by Ben himself, near...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2953","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
