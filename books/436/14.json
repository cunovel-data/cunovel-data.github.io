{"id":14279,"no":14,"title":"CHAPTER XIII. THE FIRST CIGAR.","content":"It was a week or more after Ben started in business as a baggage-smasher, that, in returning from carrying a carpet-bag to Lovejoy\u0027s Hotel, on Broadway, he fell in with his first city acquaintance, Jerry Collins. Jerry had just \"polished up\" a gentleman\u0027s boots, and, having been unusually lucky this morning in securing shines, felt disposed to be lavish. \"How are you, Ben?\" asked Jerry. \"What are you up to now?\" \"I\u0027m a baggage-smasher,\" answered Ben, who was beginning to adopt the language of the streets. \"How does it pay?\" \"Well,\" said Ben, \"sometimes it pays first rate, when I\u0027m lucky. Other days I don\u0027t get much to do. I didn\u0027t make but fifteen cents this morning. I[Pg 149] carried a bag up to Lovejoy\u0027s, and that\u0027s all the man would pay me.\" \"I\u0027ve made fifty cents this mornin\u0027. Look here, Johnny.\" The Johnny addressed was a boy who sold cigars, four for ten cents. \"I\u0027ll take two,\" said Jerry, producing five cents. \"Six cents for two,\" said the cigar boy. \"All right, I\u0027ll owe you the other cent,\" said Jerry, coolly. \"Do you smoke?\" inquired Ben. \"In course I do. Don\u0027t you?\" \"No.\" \"Why don\u0027t you?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Ben. \"Do you like it?\" \"It\u0027s bully. Here, take this cigar. I bought it for you.\" Ben hesitated; but finally, induced mainly by a curiosity to see how it seemed, accepted the cigar, and lighted it by Jerry\u0027s. The two boys sat down on an empty box, and Jerry instructed Ben how to puff. Ben did not particularly enjoy it; but thought he might as well learn now as any other time. His[Pg 150] companion puffed away like a veteran smoker; but after a while Ben\u0027s head began to swim, and he felt sick at his stomach. \"I don\u0027t feel well,\" he said. \"I guess I\u0027ll stop smoking.\" \"Oh, go ahead,\" said Jerry. \"It\u0027s only because it\u0027s the first time. You\u0027ll like it after a while.\" Thus encouraged, Ben continued to smoke, though his head and his stomach got continually worse. \"I don\u0027t like it,\" gasped Ben, throwing down the cigar. \"I\u0027m going to stop.\" \"You\u0027ve got a healthy color,\" said Jerry, slyly. \"I\u0027m afraid I\u0027m going to be awful sick,\" said Ben, whose sensations were very far from comfortable. Just at this moment, ignorant of the brief character of his present feelings, he heartily wished himself at home, for the first time since his arrival in the city. \"You do look rather green,\" said Jerry. \"Maybe you\u0027re going to have the cholera. I\u0027ve heard that there\u0027s some cases round.\" This suggestion alarmed Ben, who laid his head down between his knees, and began to feel worse than ever.[Pg 151] \"Don\u0027t be scared,\" said Jerry, thinking it time to relieve Ben\u0027s mind. \"It\u0027s only the cigar. You\u0027ll feel all right in a jiffy.\" While Ben was experiencing the disagreeable effects of his first cigar, he resolved never to smoke another. But, as might have been expected, he felt differently on recovering. It was not long before he could puff away with as much enjoyment and unconcern as any of his street companions, and a part of his earnings were consumed in this way. It may be remarked here that the street boy does not always indulge in the luxury of a whole cigar. Sometimes he picks up a fragment which has been discarded by the original smoker. There are some small dealers, who make it a business to collect these \"stubs,\" or employ others to do so, and then sell them to the street boys, at a penny apiece, or less, according to size. Sometimes these stubs are bought in preference to a cheap cigar, because they are apt to be of a superior quality. Ben, however, never smoked \"stubs.\" In course of time he became very much like other street boys; but in some respects his taste was more fastidious, and he preferred to indulge[Pg 152] himself in a cheap cigar, which was not second-hand. We must now pass rapidly over the six years which elapsed from the date of Ben\u0027s first being set adrift in the streets to the period at which our story properly begins. These years have been fruitful of change to our young adventurer. They have changed him from a country boy of ten, to a self-reliant and independent street boy of sixteen. The impressions left by his early and careful home-training have been mostly effaced. Nothing in his garb now distinguishes him from the class of which he is a type. He has long since ceased to care for neat or whole attire, or carefully brushed hair. His straggling locks, usually long, protrude from an aperture in his hat. His shoes would make a very poor advertisement for the shoemaker by whom they were originally manufactured. His face is not always free from stains, and his street companions have long since ceased to charge him with putting on airs, on account of the superior neatness of his personal appearance. Indeed, he has become rather a favorite among them, in consequence of his[Pg 153] frankness, and his willingness at all times to lend a helping hand to a comrade temporarily \"hard up.\" He has adopted to a great extent the tastes and habits of the class to which he belongs, and bears with acquired philosophy the hardships and privations which fall to their lot. Like \"Ragged Dick,\" he has a sense of humor, which is apt to reveal itself in grotesque phrases, or amusing exaggerations. Of course his education, so far as education is obtained from books, has not advanced at all. He has not forgotten how to read, having occasion to read the daily papers. Occasionally, too, he indulges himself in a dime novel, the more sensational the better, and is sometimes induced to read therefrom to a group of companions whose attainments are even less than his own. It may be asked whether he ever thinks of his Pennsylvania home, of his parents and his sister. At first he thought of them frequently; but by degrees he became so accustomed to the freedom and independence of his street life, with its constant variety, that he would have been unwilling to return, even if the original cause of his leaving home were removed.[Pg 154] Life in a Pennsylvania village seemed \"slow\" compared with the excitement of his present life. In the winter, when the weather was inclement, and the lodging accommodations afforded by the street were not particularly satisfactory, Ben found it convenient to avail himself of the cheap lodgings furnished by the Newsboys\u0027 Lodging House; but at other times, particularly in the warm summer nights, he saved his six cents, and found a lodging for himself among the wharves, or in some lane or alley. Of the future he did not think much. Like street boys in general, his horizon was limited by the present. Sometimes, indeed, it did occur to him that he could not be a luggage boy all his lifetime. Some time or other he must take up something else. However, Ben carelessly concluded that he could make a living somehow or other, and as to old age that was too far ahead to disquiet himself about.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2953/81202.html","bookId":436,"book":{"id":436,"title":"Ben, the Luggage Boy; or, Among the Wharves","description":"简介： In presenting Ben, the Luggage Boy, to the public, as the fifth of the Ragged Dick Series, the author desires to say that it is in all essential points a true history; the particulars of the story having been communicated to him, by Ben himself, near...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2953","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
