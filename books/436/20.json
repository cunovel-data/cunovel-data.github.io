{"id":14285,"no":20,"title":"CHAPTER XIX. WHICH IS THE GUILTY PARTY?","content":"It was an exciting moment for Ben. He felt that his character for honesty was at stake. In case the pickpocket succeeded in getting off with the letter and money, Mr. Sampson would no doubt come to the conclusion that he had appropriated the fifty dollars to his own use, while his story of the robbery would be regarded as an impudent fabrication. He might even be arrested, and sentenced to the Island for theft. If this should happen, though he were innocent, Ben felt that he should not be willing to make himself known to his sister or his parents. But there was a chance of getting back the money, and he resolved to do his best. The pickpocket turned down a side street, his object being to get out of the range of observation as soon as possible. But one thing he did not anticipate, and this was Ben\u0027s immediate discovery of his[Pg 212] loss. On this subject he was soon enlightened. He saw Ben jump from the horse-car, and his first impulse was to run. He made a quick movement in advance, and then paused. It occurred to him that he occupied a position of advantage with regard to his accuser, being respectably dressed, while Ben was merely a ragged street boy, whose word probably would not inspire much confidence. This vantage ground he would give up by having recourse to flight, as this would be a virtual acknowledgment of guilt. He resolved instantaneously to assume an attitude of conscious integrity, and frown down upon Ben from the heights of assumed respectability. There was one danger, however, that he was known to some of the police force in his true character. But he must take the risk of recognition. On landing in the middle of the street, Ben lost no time; but, running up to the pickpocket, caught him by the arm. \"What do you want, boy?\" he demanded, in a tone of indifference. \"I want my money,\" said Ben.[Pg 213] \"I don\u0027t understand you,\" said the pickpocket loftily. \"Look here, mister,\" said Ben, impatiently; \"you know well enough what I mean. You took a letter with money in it out of my pocket. Just hand it back, and I won\u0027t say anything about it.\" \"You\u0027re an impudent young rascal,\" returned the \"gentleman,\" affecting to be outraged by such a charge. \"Do you dare to accuse a gentleman like me of robbing a ragmuffin like you?\" \"Yes, I do,\" said Ben, boldly. \"Then you\u0027re either crazy or impudent, I don\u0027t know which.\" \"Call me what you please; but give me back my money.\" \"I don\u0027t believe you ever had five dollars in your possession. How much do you mean to say there was in this letter?\" \"Fifty dollars,\" answered Ben. The pickpocket had an object in asking this question. He wanted to learn whether the sum of money was sufficient to make it worth his while to keep it. Had it been three or four dollars, he might have[Pg 214] given it up, to avoid risk and trouble. But on finding that it was fifty dollars he determined to hold on to it at all hazards. \"Clear out, boy,\" he said, fiercely. \"I shan\u0027t stand any of your impudence.\" \"Give me my money, then.\" \"If you don\u0027t stop that, I\u0027ll knock you down,\" repeated the pickpocket, shaking off Ben\u0027s grasp, and moving forward rapidly. If he expected to frighten our hero away thus easily, he was very much mistaken. Ben had too much at stake to give up the attempt to recover the letter. He ran forward, and, seizing the man by the arm, he reiterated, in a tone of firm determination, \"Give me my money, or I\u0027ll call a copp.\" \"Take that, you young villain!\" exclaimed the badgered thief, bringing his fist in contact with Ben\u0027s face in such a manner as to cause the blood to flow. In a physical contest it was clear that Ben would get the worst of it. He was but a boy of sixteen, strong, indeed, of his age; but still what could he expect to accomplish against a tall man of mature[Pg 215] age? He saw that he needed help, and he called out at the top of his lungs, \"Help! Police!\" His antagonist was adroit, and a life spent in eluding the law had made him quick-witted. He turned the tables upon Ben by turning round, grasping him firmly by the arm, and repeating in a voice louder than Ben\u0027s, \"Help! Police!\" Contrary to the usual custom in such cases, a policeman happened to be near, and hurried to the spot where he was apparently wanted. \"What\u0027s the row?\" he asked. Before Ben had time to prefer his charge, the pickpocket said glibly:— \"Policeman, I give this boy in charge.\" \"What\u0027s he been doing?\" \"I caught him with his hand in my pocket,\" said the man. \"He\u0027s a thieving young vagabond.\" \"That\u0027s a lie!\" exclaimed Ben, rather startled at the unexpected turn which affairs had taken. \"He\u0027s a pickpocket.\" The real culprit shrugged his shoulders. \"You aint quite smart enough, boy,\" he said. \"Has he taken anything of yours?\" asked the[Pg 216] policeman, who supposed Ben to be what he was represented. \"No,\" said the pickpocket; \"but he came near taking a money letter which I have in my pocket.\" Here, with astonishing effrontery, he displayed the letter which he had stolen from Ben. \"That\u0027s my letter,\" said Ben. \"He took it from my pocket.\" \"A likely story,\" smiled the pickpocket, in serene superiority. \"The letter is for Mrs. Abercrombie, a friend of mine, and contains fifty dollars. I incautiously wrote upon the envelope \u0027Money enclosed,\u0027 which attracted the attention of this young vagabond, as I held it in my hand. On replacing it in my pocket, he tried to get possession of it.\" \"That\u0027s a lie from beginning to end,\" exclaimed Ben, impetuously. \"He\u0027s tryin\u0027 to make me out a thief, when he\u0027s one himself.\" \"Well, what is your story?\" asked the policeman, who, however, had already decided in his own mind that Ben was the guilty party. \"I was ridin\u0027 in the Fourth Avenue cars along[Pg 217] side of this man,\" said Ben, \"when he put his hand in my pocket, and took out the letter that he\u0027s just showed you. I jumped out after him, and asked him to give it back, when he fetched me a lick in the face.\" \"Do you mean to say that a ragamuffin like you had fifty dollars?\" demanded the thief. \"No,\" said Ben, \"the money wasn\u0027t mine. I was carryin\u0027 it up to Mrs. Abercrombie, who lives on Madison Avenue.\" \"It\u0027s a likely story that a ragamuffin like you would be trusted with so much money.\" \"If you don\u0027t believe it,\" said Ben, \"go to Mr. Abercrombie\u0027s office in Wall Street. Mr. Sampson gave it to me only a few minutes ago. If he says he didn\u0027t, just carry me to the station-house as quick as you want to.\" This confident assertion of Ben\u0027s put matters in rather a different light. It seemed straightforward, and the reference might easily prove which was the real culprit. The pickpocket saw that the officer wavered, and rejoined hastily, \"You must[Pg 218] expect the officer\u0027s a fool to believe your ridiculous story.\" \"It\u0027s not so ridiculous,\" answered the policeman, scrutinizing the speaker with sudden suspicion. \"I am not sure but the boy is right.\" \"I\u0027m willing to let the matter drop,\" said the pickpocket, magnanimously; \"as he didn\u0027t succeed in getting my money, I will not prosecute. You may let him go, Mr. Officer.\" \"Not so fast,\" said the policeman, his suspicions of the other party getting stronger and more clearly defined. \"I haven\u0027t any authority to do as you say.\" \"Very well, take him along then. I suppose the law must take its course.\" \"Yes, it must.\" \"Very well, boy, I\u0027m sorry you\u0027ve got into such a scrape; but it\u0027s your own fault. Good morning, officer.\" \"You\u0027re in too much of a hurry,\" said the policeman, coolly; \"you must go along with me too.\" \"Really,\" said the thief, nervously, \"I hope you\u0027ll excuse me. I\u0027ve got an important engage[Pg 219]ment this morning, and—I—in fact it will be excessively inconvenient.\" \"I\u0027m sorry to put you to inconvenience, but it can\u0027t be helped.\" \"Really, Mr. Officer—\" \"It\u0027s no use. I shall need you. Oblige me by handing me that letter.\" \"Here it is,\" said the thief, unwillingly surrendering it. \"Really, it\u0027s excessively provoking. I\u0027d rather lose the money than break my engagement. I\u0027ll promise to be on hand at the trial, whenever it comes off; if you keep the money it will be a guaranty of my appearance.\" \"I don\u0027t know about that,\" answered the officer \"As to being present at the trial, I mean that you shall be.\" \"Of course, I promised that.\" \"There\u0027s one little matter you seem to forget, said the officer; \"your appearance may be quite as necessary as the boy\u0027s. It may be your trial and not his.\" \"Do you mean to insult me?\" demanded the pickpocket, haughtily.[Pg 220] \"Not by no manner of means. I aint the judge, you know. If your story is all right, it\u0027ll appear so.\" \"Of course; but I shall have to break my engagement.\" \"Well, that can\u0027t be helped as I see. Come along, if you please.\" He tucked one arm in that of the man, and the other in Ben\u0027s, and moved towards the station-house. Of the two Ben seemed to be much the more unconcerned. He was confident that his innocence would be proclaimed, while the other was equally convinced that trouble awaited him. \"Well, boy, how do you like going to the station-house?\" asked the policeman. \"I don\u0027t mind as long as he goes with me,\" answered Ben. \"What I was most afraid of was that I\u0027d lose the money, and then Mr. Sampson would have taken me for a thief.\" Meanwhile the other party was rapidly getting more and more nervous. He felt that he was marching to his fate, and that the only way of escape was by flight, and that immediate; for they[Pg 221] were very near the station-house. Just as Ben pronounced the last words, the thief gathered all his strength, and broke from the grasp of the officer, whose hold was momentarily relaxed. Once free he showed an astonishing rapidity. The officer hesitated for an instant, for he had another prisoner to guard. \"Go after him,\" exclaimed Ben, eagerly. \"Don\u0027t let him escape. I\u0027ll stay where I am.\" The conviction that the escaped party was the real thief determined the policeman to follow Ben\u0027s advice. He let him go, and started in rapid pursuit of the fugitive. Ben sat down on a doorstep, and awaited anxiously the result of the chase.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2953/81208.html","bookId":436,"book":{"id":436,"title":"Ben, the Luggage Boy; or, Among the Wharves","description":"简介： In presenting Ben, the Luggage Boy, to the public, as the fifth of the Ragged Dick Series, the author desires to say that it is in all essential points a true history; the particulars of the story having been communicated to him, by Ben himself, near...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2953","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
