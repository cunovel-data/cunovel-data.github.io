{"id":14268,"no":3,"title":"CHAPTER II. HOW BEN COMMENCED HIS STREET LIFE.","content":"One pleasant morning, six years before the date at which this story commences, a small coasting-vessel drew up at a North River pier in the lower part of the city. It was loaded with freight, but there was at least one passenger on board. A boy of ten, dressed in a neat jacket and pants of gray-mixed cloth, stood on deck, watching with interest the busy city which they had just reached. \"Well, bub, here we are,\" said the captain as he passed. \"I suppose you know your way home.\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Are you going on shore now?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Well, good luck to you, my lad. If you are ever down this way, when I\u0027m in port, I shall be glad to see you.\" \"Thank you, sir; good-by.\"[Pg 24] \"Good-by.\" Ben clambered over the side, and stepped upon the wharf. In the great city he knew no one, and he was an utter stranger to the streets, never before having visited it. He was about to begin life for himself at the age of ten. He had voluntarily undertaken to support himself, leaving behind him a comfortable home, where he had been well cared for. I must explain how this came about. Ben had a pleasant face, and would be considered good-looking. But there was a flash in his eye, when aroused, which showed that he had a quick temper, and there was an expression of firmness, unusual to one so young, which might have been read by an experienced physiognomist. He was quick-tempered, proud, and probably obstinate. Yet with these qualities he was pleasant in his manners, and had a sense of humor, which made him a favorite among his companions. His father was a coal-dealer in a town a few miles distant from Philadelphia, of a hasty temper like Ben himself. A week before he had punished Ben severely for a fault which he had not committed.[Pg 25] The boy\u0027s pride revolted at the injustice, and, young as he was, he resolved to run away. I suppose there are few boys who do not form this resolution at some time or other in their lives; but as a general thing it amounts to nothing. With Ben it was different. His was a strong nature, whether for good or for evil, and when he decided to do anything he was not easily moved from his resolve. He forgot, in the present case, that, though he had been unjustly punished, the injustice was not intentional on the part of his father, who had been under a wrong impression respecting him. But right or wrong, Ben made up his mind to run away; and he did so. It was two or three days before a good opportunity presented itself. Then, with a couple of shirts and collars rolled up in a small bundle, he made his escape to Philadelphia, and after roaming about the streets for several hours he made his way to the wharves, where he found a vessel bound for New York. Representing to the captain that he lived in New York, and had no money to pay his passage home, that officer, who was a good-natured man, agreed to carry him for nothing.[Pg 26] The voyage was now over, and Ben landed, as we have said, an utter stranger, with very indefinite ideas as to how he was to make his living. He had told the captain that he knew his way home, for having falsely represented that he lived in New York, he was in a manner compelled to this additional falsehood. Still, in spite of his friendless condition, his spirits were very good. The sun shone brightly; all looked animated and cheerful. Ben saw numbers of men at work about him, and he thought, \"It will be a pity if I cannot make a living.\" He did not care to linger about the wharf, for the captain might be led to doubt his story. Accordingly he crossed the street, and at a venture turned up a street facing the wharf. Ben did not know much about New York, even by report. But he had heard of Broadway,—as who has not?—and this was about all he did know. When, therefore, he had gone a short distance, he ventured to ask a boot-black, whom he encountered at the corner of the next block, \"Can you tell me the shortest way to Broadway?\" \"Follow your nose, Johnny,\" was the reply.[Pg 27] \"My name isn\u0027t Johnny,\" replied Ben, rather indignant at the familiarity. He had not learned that, in New York, Johnny is the generic name for boy, where the specific name is unknown. \"Aint it though?\" returned the boot-black \"What\u0027s the price of turnips out where you live?\" \"I\u0027ll make your nose turn up if you aint careful,\" retorted Ben, wrathfully. \"You\u0027ll do,\" said the boot-black, favorably impressed by Ben\u0027s pluck. \"Just go straight ahead, and you\u0027ll come to Broadway. I\u0027m going that way, and you can come along with me if you want to.\" \"Thank you,\" said Ben, appeased by the boy\u0027s changed manner. \"Are you going to stay here?\" inquired his new acquaintance. \"Yes,\" said Ben; \"I\u0027m going to live here.\" \"Where do your friends live?\" \"I haven\u0027t got any friends in New York,\" said Ben, with a little hesitation. \"Over in Brooklyn, or Jersey, maybe?\" \"No, I don\u0027t know anybody this way.\"[Pg 28] \"Whew!\" whistled the other. \"How you goin\u0027 to live?\" \"I expect to earn my living,\" said Ben, in a tone of importance. \"Father and mother dead?\" \"No, they\u0027re alive.\" \"I s\u0027pose they\u0027re poor?\" \"No, they\u0027re not; they\u0027re well off.\" The boot-black looked puzzled. \"Why didn\u0027t you stay at home then? Wouldn\u0027t they let you?\" \"Of course they would. The fact is, I\u0027ve run away.\" \"Maybe they\u0027d adopt me instead of you.\" \"I don\u0027t think they would,\" said Ben, laughing. \"I wish somebody with lots of cash would adopt me, and make a gentleman of me. It would be a good sight better\u0027n blackin\u0027 boots.\" \"Do you make much money that way?\" inquired Ben. \"Pleasant days like this, sometimes I make a dollar, but when it rains there aint much doin\u0027.\"[Pg 29] \"How much have you made this morning?\" asked Ben, with interest. \"Sixty cents.\" \"Sixty cents, and it isn\u0027t more than ten o\u0027clock. That\u0027s doing pretty well.\" \"\u0027Taint so good in the afternoon. Most every body gets their boots blacked in the mornin\u0027. What are you goin\u0027 to do?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Ben. \"Goin\u0027 to black boots? I\u0027ll show you how,\" said the other, generously overlooking all considerations of possible rivalry. \"I don\u0027t think I should like that very well,\" said Ben, slowly. Having been brought up in a comfortable home, he had a prejudice in favor of clean hands and unsoiled clothes,—a prejudice of which his street life speedily cured him. \"I think I should rather sell papers, or go into a store,\" said Ben. \"You can\u0027t make so much money sellin\u0027 papers,\" said his new acquaintance. \"Then you might get \u0027stuck\u0027\"[Pg 30]. \"What\u0027s that?\" inquired Ben, innocently. \"Don\u0027t you know?\" asked the boot-black, wonderingly. \"Why, it\u0027s when you\u0027ve got more papers than you can sell. That\u0027s what takes off the profits. I was a newsboy once; but it\u0027s too hard work for the money. There aint no chance of gettin\u0027 stuck on my business.\" \"It\u0027s rather a dirty business,\" said Ben, venturing to state his main objection, at the risk of offending. But Jerry Collins, for that was his name, was not very sensitive on this score. \"What\u0027s the odds?\" he said, indifferently. \"A feller gets used to it.\" Ben looked at Jerry\u0027s begrimed hands, and clothes liberally marked with spots of blacking, and he felt that he was not quite ready to get used to appearing in public in this way. He was yet young in his street life. The time came when he ceased to be so particular. \"Where do you board?\" asked Ben, after a little pause. Jerry Collins stared at the questioner as if he sus[Pg 31]pected that a joke was intended. But Ben\u0027s serious face assured him that he was in earnest. \"You\u0027re jolly green,\" he remarked, sententiously. \"Look here,\" said Ben, with spirit, \"I\u0027ll give you a licking if you say that again.\" It may be considered rather singular that Jerry, Instead of resenting this threat, was led by it to regard Ben with favor. \"I didn\u0027t mean anything,\" he said, by way of apology. \"You\u0027re a trump, and you\u0027ll get over it when you\u0027ve been in the city a week.\" \"What made you call me green?\" asked Ben. \"Did you think I boarded up to the Fifth Avenue?\" asked Jerry. \"What\u0027s that,—a hotel?\" \"Yes, it\u0027s one of the big hotels, where they eat off gold plates.\" \"No, I don\u0027t suppose you board there,\" said Ben, laughing; \"but I suppose there are cheaper boarding-places. Where do you sleep?\" \"Sometimes in wagons, or in door-ways, on the docks, or anywhere where I get a chance.\"[Pg 32] \"Don\u0027t you get cold sleeping out-doors?\" asked Ben. \"Oh, I\u0027m used to it,\" said Jerry. \"When it\u0027s cold I go to the Lodging House.\" \"What\u0027s that?\" Jerry explained that there was a Newsboys\u0027 Lodging House, where a bed could be obtained for six cents a night. \"That\u0027s cheap,\" said Ben. \"\u0027Taint so cheap as sleepin\u0027 out-doors,\" returned the boot-black. This was true; but Ben thought he would rather pay the six cents than sleep out, if it were only for the damage likely to come to his clothes, which were yet clean and neat. Looking at Jerry\u0027s suit, however, he saw that this consideration would be likely to have less weight with him. He began to understand that he had entered upon a very different life from the one he had hitherto led. He was not easily daunted, however. \"If he can stand it, I can,\" he said to himself. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2953/81191.html","bookId":436,"book":{"id":436,"title":"Ben, the Luggage Boy; or, Among the Wharves","description":"简介： In presenting Ben, the Luggage Boy, to the public, as the fifth of the Ragged Dick Series, the author desires to say that it is in all essential points a true history; the particulars of the story having been communicated to him, by Ben himself, near...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2953","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
