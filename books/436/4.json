{"id":14269,"no":4,"title":"CHAPTER III. STREET SCENES.","content":"\"Here\u0027s Broadway,\" said Jerry, suddenly. They emerged from the side street on which they had been walking, and, turning the corner, found themselves in the great thoroughfare, a block or two above Trinity Church. Ben surveyed the busy scenes that opened before him, with the eager interest of a country boy who saw them for the first time. \"What church is that?\" he asked, pointing to the tall spire of the imposing church that faces Wall Street. \"That\u0027s Trinity Church.\" \"Do you go to church there?\" \"I don\u0027t go anywhere else,\" said Jerry, equivocally. \"What\u0027s the use of going to church?\" \"I thought everybody went to church,\" said Ben, speaking from his experience in a country village[Pg 34] \"that is, most everybody,\" he corrected himself, as several persons occurred to his mind who were more punctual in their attendance at the liquor saloon than the church. \"If I\u0027d got good clothes like you have I\u0027d go once just to see what it\u0027s like; but I\u0027d a good sight rather go to the old Bowery Theatre.\" \"But you ought not to say that,\" said Ben, a little startled. \"Why not?\" \"Because it\u0027s better to go to church than to the theatre.\" \"Is it?\" said Jerry. \"Well, you can go if you want to. I\u0027d give more for a stunnin\u0027 old play at the Bowery than fifty churches.\" Ben began to suspect that Jerry was rather loose in his ideas on the subject of religion, but did not think it best to say so, for fear of giving offence, though in all probability Jerry\u0027s sensitiveness would not have been at all disturbed by such a charge. During the last portion of the conversation they had been standing still at the street corner.[Pg 35] \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 to Nassau Street,\" said Jerry. \"If you want to go up Broadway, that\u0027s the way.\" Without waiting for an answer he darted across the street, threading his way among the numerous vehicles with a coolness and a success which amazed Ben, who momentarily expected to see him run over. He drew a long breath when he saw him safe on the other side, and bethought himself that he would not like to take a similar risk. He felt sorry to have Jerry leave him so abruptly. The boot-black had already imparted to him considerable information about New York, which he saw was likely to be of benefit to him. Besides, he felt that any society was better than solitude, and a sudden feeling of loneliness overpowered him, as he felt that among the crowd of persons that jostled him as he stood at the corner, there was not one who felt an interest in him, or even knew his name. It was very different in his native village, where he knew everybody, and everybody had a friendly word for him. The thought did occur to him for a moment whether he had been wise in running away from home; but the thought of the[Pg 36] unjust punishment came with it, and his expression became firmer and more resolute. \"I won\u0027t go home if I starve,\" he said proudly to himself; and armed with this new resolution he proceeded up Broadway. His attention was soon drawn to the street merchants doing business on the sidewalk. Here was a vender of neckties, displaying a varied assortment of different colors, for \"only twenty-five cents each.\" Next came a candy merchant with his stock in trade, divided up into irregular lumps, and labelled a penny apiece. They looked rather tempting, and Ben would have purchased, but he knew very well that his cash capital amounted to only twenty-five cents, which, considering that he was as yet without an income, was likely to be wanted for other purposes. Next came a man with an assortment of knives, all of them open, and sticking into a large board, which was the only shop required by their proprietor. Ben stopped a moment to look at them. He had always had a fancy for knives, but was now without one. In fact he had sold a handsome knife, which he had received as a birthday present, for seventy[Pg 37]-five cents, to raise money for his present expedition. Of this sum but twenty-five cents remained. \"Will you buy a knife to-day, young gentleman?\" asked the vender, who was on the alert for customers. \"No, I guess not,\" said Ben. \"Here\u0027s a very nice one for only one dollar,\" said the street merchant, taking up a showy-looking knife with three blades. \"Its the best of steel, warranted. You won\u0027t get another such knife for the price in the city.\" It did look cheap certainly. Ben could not but allow that. He would like to have owned it, but circumstances forbade. \"No, I won\u0027t buy to-day,\" he said. \"Here, you shall have it for ninety-four cents,\" and the vender began to roll it up in a piece of paper. \"You can\u0027t say it isn\u0027t cheap.\" \"Yes, it\u0027s cheap enough,\" said Ben, moving away, \"but I haven\u0027t got the money with me.\" This settled the matter, and the dealer reluctantly unrolled it, and replaced it among his stock.[Pg 38] \"If you\u0027ll call round to-morrow, I\u0027ll save it for you till then,\" he said. \"All right,\" said Ben. \"I wonder,\" he thought, \"whether he would be so anxious to sell, if he knew that I had run away from home, and had but twenty-five cents in the world?\" Ben\u0027s neat dress deceived the man, who naturally supposed him to belong to a city family well to do. Our young hero walked on till he came to the Astor House. He stood on the steps a few minutes taking a view of what may be considered the liveliest and most animated part of New York. Nearly opposite was Barnum\u0027s American Museum, the site being now occupied by the costly and elegant Herald Building and Park Bank. He looked across to the lower end of the City Hall Park, not yet diverted from its original purpose for the new Post Office building. He saw a procession of horse-cars in constant motion up and down Park Row. Everything seemed lively and animated; and again the thought came to Ben, \"If there is employment for all these people, there must be something for me to do.\"[Pg 39] He crossed to the foot of the Park, and walked up on the Park Row side. Here again he saw a line of street merchants. Most conspicuous were the dealers in penny ballads, whose wares lined the railings, and were various enough to suit every taste. Here was an old woman, who might have gained a first prize for ugliness, presiding over an apple-stand. \"Take one, honey; it\u0027s only two cints,\" she said, observing that Ben\u0027s attention was drawn to a rosy-cheeked apple. Ben was rather hungry, and reflecting that probably apples were as cheap as any other article of diet, he responded to the appeal by purchasing. It proved to be palatable, and he ate it with a good relish. \"Ice-cream, only a penny a glass,\" was the next announcement. The glasses, to be sure, were of very small size. Still ice-cream in any quantity for a penny seemed so ridiculously cheap that Ben, poor as he was, could not resist the temptation. \"I\u0027ll take a glass,\" he said. A dab of ice-cream was deposited in a glass, and with a pewter spoon handed to Ben. He raised[Pg 40] the spoon to his mouth, but alas! the mixture was not quite so tempting to the taste as to the eye and the pocket. It might be ice-cream, but there was an indescribable flavor about it, only to be explained on the supposition that the ice had been frozen dish-water. Ben\u0027s taste had not been educated up to that point which would enable him to relish it. He laid it down with an involuntary contortion of the face. \"Give it to me, Johnny,\" he heard at his elbow. Turning, he saw a small, dirty-faced boy of six, with bare feet and tattered attire, who was gazing with a look of greedy desire at the delicious mixture. Ben handed him the glass and spoon, and stood by, looking at him with some curiosity as he disposed of the contents with a look of evident enjoyment. \"Do you like it?\" he asked. \"It\u0027s bully,\" said the young epicure. If Ben had not been restricted by his narrow means, he would have purchased another glass for the urchin. It would have been a very cheap[Pg 41] \"treat.\" But our young adventurer reflected that he had but twenty-two cents left, and prudence forbade. \"I don\u0027t see how he can like the nasty stuff,\" he thought. But the time was to come when Ben himself, grown less fastidious, would be able to relish food quite as uninviting. Ben made his way across the Park to Broadway again. He felt that it was high time for him to be seeking employment. His ideas on this subject were not very well defined, but when he left home he made up his mind that he would try to get a place in a store on Broadway. He supposed that, among the great number of stores, there would be a chance for him to get into some one. He expected to make enough to live in a comfortable boarding-house, and buy his clothes, though he supposed that would be about all. He expected to have to economize on spending money the first year, but the second year his wages would be raised, and then it would come easier. All this shows how very verdant and[Pg 42] unpractical our young adventurer was, and what disappointment he was preparing for himself. However, Ben\u0027s knowledge was to come by experience, and that before long. Reaching Broadway, he walked up slowly on the west side, looking in at the shop-windows. In the lower part of this busy street are many wholesale houses, while the upper part is devoted principally to retail shops. Coming to a large warehouse for the sale of ready-made clothing, Ben thought he might as well begin there. In such a large place there must be a good deal to do. He passed in and looked about him rather doubtfully. The counters, which were numerous, were filled high with ready-made garments. Ben saw no one as small as himself, and that led him to doubt whether his size might not be an objection. \"Well, sonny, what do you want?\" asked a clerk. \"Don\u0027t you want to hire a boy?\" asked our young adventurer, plunging into his business. \"I suppose you have had considerable experience in the business?\" said the clerk inclined to banter him a little.[Pg 43] \"No, I haven\u0027t,\" said Ben, frankly. \"Indeed, I judged from your looks that you were a man of experience.\" \"If you don\u0027t want to hire me, I\u0027ll go,\" said Ben, independently. \"Well, young man, I\u0027m afraid you\u0027ll have to go. The fact is, we should have to higher you before we could hire you;\" and the clerk laughed at his witticism. Ben naturally saw nothing to laugh at, but felt rather indignant. He stepped into the street, a little depressed at the result of his first application. But then, as he reflected, there were a great many other stores besides this, and he might have better luck next time. He walked on some distance, however, before trying again. Indeed, he had got above Bleecker Street, when his attention was arrested by a paper pasted inside of a shop-window, bearing the inscription:— \"CASH-BOYS WANTED.\" Ben did not clearly understand what were the duties of a cash-boy, though he supposed they must have something to do with receiving money. Look[Pg 44]ing in through the glass door he saw boys as small as himself flitting about, and this gave him courage to enter and make an application for a place. He entered, therefore, and walked up boldly to the first clerk he saw. \"Do you want a cash-boy?\" he asked. \"Go up to that desk, Johnny,\" said the clerk, pointing to a desk about midway of the store. A stout gentleman stood behind it, writing something in a large book. Ben went up, and repeated his inquiry. \"Do you want a cash-boy?\" \"How old are you?\" asked the gentleman looking down at him. \"Ten years old.\" \"Have you ever been in a store?\" \"No, sir.\" \"Do you live in the city?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"With your parents?\" \"No, sir,\" said Ben, with hesitation. \"Who do you live with, then?\" \"With nobody. I take care of myself.\"[Pg 45] \"Humph!\" The gentleman looked a little surprised, not at the idea of a boy of ten looking out for himself, for such cases are common enough in New York, but at the idea of such a well-dressed lad as Ben being in that situation. \"How long have you been your own man?\" he inquired. \"I\u0027ve only just begun,\" Ben admitted. \"Are your parents dead?\" \"No, sir; they\u0027re alive.\" \"Then I advise you to go back to them. We don\u0027t receive any boys into our employment, who do not live with their parents.\" The gentleman returned to his writing, and Ben saw that his case was hopeless. His disappointment was greater than before, for he liked the looks of the proprietor, if, as he judged, this was he. Besides, boys were wanted, and his size would be no objection, judging from the appearance of the other boys in the store. So he had been sanguine of success. Now he saw that there was an objection which he could not remove, and which would be very likely to stand in his way in other places. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2953/81192.html","bookId":436,"book":{"id":436,"title":"Ben, the Luggage Boy; or, Among the Wharves","description":"简介： In presenting Ben, the Luggage Boy, to the public, as the fifth of the Ragged Dick Series, the author desires to say that it is in all essential points a true history; the particulars of the story having been communicated to him, by Ben himself, near...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2953","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
