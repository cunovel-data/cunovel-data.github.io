Together they walked slowly into the formal dining room, where the table was set with the finest china and crystal. Everything looked flawless and yet to Colette it seemed incomplete without Christian.\n “Sit down, my dear,” Elizabeth said.\n Colette took her seat.\n “I brought out some photographs you might like to see.”\n “Of your travels?” Colette asked.\n Elizabeth smiled as Doris came into the room, carrying two lovely salads, heaped with fresh scallops, shrimp and large chunks of Dungeness crab. “No, not my travels, although Charles and I did enjoy seeing the world. We had wonderful adventures….” Her face softened for a moment, as if she’d forgotten where she was. Then she roused herself. “These pictures are of Christian as a youngster.”\n Colette rested her hands in her lap and it took her pulse a moment to return to normal. Even then, she couldn’t entirely trust her voice. “I’d enjoy that very much.”\n Elizabeth raised her eyes to Colette’s. “I thought you would.” With a mischievous smile, she continued. “Now, tell me a bit more about yourself. You said your family lived in Colorado?”\n Colette nodded and the conversation flowed from then on.\n The evening was pleasant; the meal was superb and the conversation over coffee afterward was stimulating. Later, studying photographs of Christian as a child and a teenager, Colette felt his absence with a sharp longing that was very different from the way she still missed Derek. That grief was like a dull, familiar ache. This new sensation was…pain.\n “Next week,” Elizabeth murmured as Colette prepared to leave.\n “I—”\n “Next week,” Elizabeth reiterated. “And I’ll make sure Christian comes.” She pinned Colette with narrowed eyes. “You’d like that, wouldn’t you?”\n Colette was well aware that Elizabeth already knew the answer to her own question, but she didn’t respond immediately. And when she did, she simply told the truth. “Yes,” she whispered. “Yes, I’d like that.”\n CHAPTER 27\n Alix Townsend\n The weekend was hectic for Alix and Jordan as they quietly went about changing their wedding plans. The first person they talked to was Grandma Turner, who didn’t disguise her pleasure or excitement.\n “I’d love it if you had the wedding here,” she said, beaming with pride. “Didn’t I tell you?” she whispered in Alix’s ear as she hugged her. “My grandson’s much too smart to let you go. He knows he has a winner.”\n Alix felt a sense of pure joy at Grandma Turner’s words. In the time she’d stayed with Sarah, they’d grown even closer. Alix hadn’t realized how great the physical and emotional toll had been these last few months. She’d slept twelve hours both nights she was at Sarah’s.\n Jordan had spent those days thinking. He confided in Alix that he hadn’t mentioned the broken engagement to anyone. Instead, he’d thought long and hard about what really mattered in his life. After that, he came to find her, to tell her how much he loved her and needed her. His declaration of love in the back room at Susannah’s Garden had been the most beautiful thing Alix had ever heard.\n While they were separated, Alix had sat by the lake for hours. Being there had calmed her and revived her spirits and it had given her the courage to return to Blossom Street and face her future, with or without Jordan. She felt giddy with relief at the outcome, which his grandmother had never once doubted. It was Sarah who’d suggested the lake house as the perfect place for their wedding. At the time, Alix had been convinced there’d be no wedding.\n The most difficult part would be breaking the news to Jacqueline and Susan. Jordan had asked them both to meet him and Alix at his church office, at nine o’clock Monday morning. As they waited, Alix paced nervously; she couldn’t sit or remain standing. This was going to be horrible; she just knew it. She could feel it in the pit of her stomach. Susan would hate her after this, and Jacqueline would think she was an ingrate.\n “Your mother’s never going to forgive me,” she murmured, pacing the rug in front of Jordan’s desk.\n “Alix, will you relax?”\n “But all the money Jacqueline and Reese have put into this reception…”\n “They should never have booked the country club before they discussed it with us. We were trapped.”\n “Yes, I know,” she concurred, but while that was true, it didn’t ease the ache in her stomach.\n “This is our wedding, Alix,” he reminded her, and it seemed deliciously ironic to have her own words quoted back to her. “I’m as much to blame as anyone. I didn’t listen to you, either. It embarrasses me that I failed you so completely.” He shook his head. “It’s a wonder you’re still willing to marry me.”\n His love washed over her, bringing peace to Alix’s heart. But her sense of peace didn’t last. Susan Turner arrived first, bursting into Jordan’s office as if she had a dozen other places she needed to be. She frowned at her watch. “I hope this isn’t going to take long,” she said impatiently.\n “We’re waiting for Jacqueline,” Alix said, finally sitting down.\n “Okay, fine, but I have a meeting and I can’t be late.”\n “I’m sure Jacqueline will be here soon,” Alix said, although her friend would probably show up a fashionable five minutes late, if not ten or fifteen.\n Jordan came around his desk and stood next to Alix’s chair, placing his arm around her shoulder.\n Fortunately for Susan’s schedule and Alix’s nerves, Jacqueline got there almost right away. She looked exquisite, beautifully made up and wearing an elegant pantsuit. “You asked to see us?” she said, turning to Jordan and Alix with a smile of expectation.\n “Mom, Mrs. Donovan, it might be best if you both sat down for this.” Jordan gestured to the sofa, which was positioned against the wall.\n The two women exchanged a puzzled glance, as if the other should be able to provide an explanation.\n Jordan waited until his mother sighed and sank onto the sofa beside Jacqueline. He reached for Alix’s hand and said, “Alix and I want you to know how much we appreciate everything you’ve done for us.”\n His mother checked her watch a second time. “I’m glad you’re grateful, Jordan, but Jacqueline and I are meeting with the caterers in fifteen minutes.”\n Ah, so that was it, Alix thought. They were seeing the caterers for her wedding, and she hadn’t even been informed. That said it all, as far as she was concerned.\n “Really?” Jordan shared a knowing look with Alix.\n Alix felt vindicated; Jordan could now see for himself what had been happening all along.\n “What is it?” Susan Turner demanded, glaring at them. “We have that meeting…”\n Jordan returned his mother’s gaze. “Then this will be the perfect time to tell the caterers that the big, fancy wedding you two have arranged has been canceled.”\n His mother’s jaw dropped and she leaped to her feet.\n Jacqueline gasped. “You’re canceling the wedding?”\n Jordan brought Alix’s hand up and tucked it in the crook of his elbow. “Not entirely. We—” He wasn’t allowed to complete his sentence.\n “You can’t do this! Jordan, what are you thinking?” His mother could barely get the words out fast enough.\n “Mother, if you’d allow me to finish.”\n Jacqueline just sat there quietly. When she caught Alix’s eye, she winked. Alix wasn’t sure what that meant, but she had the distinct feeling Jacqueline understood more than she’d let on.\n Jordan took advantage of the brief silence to say, “We’re still having a wedding. A different kind of wedding, that’s all.”\n “Do you realize how much work, effort and money have already gone into the preparations for this event?” Susan shrieked.\n “Yes, but—”\n Jacqueline stopped her. “Susan, it’s only right to hear them out.”\n “Mrs. Turner,” Alix said, speaking quickly in order to be heard. “I know this must be a shock.”\n “A shock,” Susan repeated and sank down onto the sofa again. “Shock doesn’t begin to describe what I’m feeling right now.”\n “I actually felt we’d gone too far,” Jacqueline said to the other woman.\n “But—”\n Jacqueline interrupted her again, nodding at Alix and Jordan. “Tell us what you’ve decided.”\n “We want a small, private wedding,” Alix explained, forever grateful to her friend. “I’ve spoken with Grandma Turner and she—”\n “The invitations have already been mailed,” Susan argued. “The wedding’s scheduled to take place right here in the downtown church. Our friends…” His mother paused and raked her fingers through her shoulder-length hair. “Oh, my goodness, we have friends driving all the way from California to attend our son’s wedding.”\n “Then apparently you’re going to have houseguests for a while,” Jacqueline said. “We’ll go to the country club afterward.”\n “But…but…” Susan sputtered.\n “It’s Alix’s wedding, too,” Jordan told his mother. “She tried very hard to be the kind of bride you wanted, but unfortunately that isn’t going to happen.”\n “This is the reason you disappeared, isn’t it?” Jacqueline asked.\n Alix nodded.\n Jordan brought her closer to his side. “Alix has been uncomfortable with this from the first and she did everything she could to let us know her feelings. But like you, I didn’t listen.”\n “You can’t cancel,” his mother insisted. “Not at this late date. Everything’s been arranged!”\n “Susan,” Jacqueline barked. “Get a grip here. This is their wedding.”\n “I apologize that all of this is last-minute,” Jordan said.\n “You want a small intimate wedding?” Jacqueline continued.\n “Then that’s what you’ll have. The people who are owed an apology are the two of you. Susan and I need to apologize for taking over the way we did.”\n Jordan’s mother was speechless.\n “A small wedding is what Alix has always wanted,” Jacqueline pointed out to Susan. “We were the ones who let things get out of hand. Reese told me that the other night. When Alix disappeared, he said I’d run roughshod over her, and he was right.”\n Alix bit her lip to hold back tears. How privileged she was to have these two wonderful friends.\n “I’ve had more time to adjust to this since Alix left,” Jacqueline said kindly. “Susan, once you’ve had a chance to think about it, you’ll see this is the best thing all around.”\n In her effort to build a positive relationship with her future mother-in-law, Alix had repeatedly given in to Susan’s demands. The hives had taught her a valuable lesson—denying her emotions didn’t mean they’d disappear. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/back-on-blossom-street-blossom-street-4/page-37.html","bookId":1936,"book":{"id":1936,"title":"Back on Blossom Street (Blossom Street #4)","description":"Storyline: \n Back on Blossom Street (Blossom Street #4) \n There\u0027s a new shop on Seattle\u0027s Blossom Street--a flower store called Susannah\u0027s Garden, right next door to A Good Yarn.
