{"id":1936,"title":"Back on Blossom Street (Blossom Street #4)","description":"Storyline: Back on Blossom Street (Blossom Street #4) There\u0027s a new shop on Seattle\u0027s Blossom Street--a flower store called Susannah\u0027s Garden, right next door to A Good Yarn. Susannah Nelson, the owner, has just hired a young widow named Colette Blake. A couple of months earlier, Colette had abruptly quit her previous job--after a brief affair with her boss. To her dismay, he\u0027s suddenly begun placing weekly orders for flower arrangements! Susannah and Colette both join Lydia Goetz\u0027s new knitting class. Lydia\u0027s previous classes have forged lasting friendships, and this one is no exception. But Lydia and her sister, Margaret, have worries of their own. Margaret\u0027s daughter, Julia, has been the victim of a random carjacking, and the entire family is thrown into emotional chaos. Then there\u0027s Alix Townsend. Her wedding to Jordan Turner is only months away--but she\u0027s not sure she can go through with it. Her love for Jordan isn\u0027t in question; what she can\u0027t handle is the whole wedding extravaganza engineered by her mentor, Jacqueline, with the enthusiastic cooperation of her future mother-in-law. A reception at the country club and hundreds of guests she\u0027s never even met--it\u0027s just not Alix. Like everyone else in Lydia\u0027s knitting class, Alix knows there\u0027s a solution to every problem...and that another woman can usually help you find it!","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/back-on-blossom-street-blossom-street-4.jpg","author":"Debbie Macomber","type":"Romance","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":54,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Romance","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
