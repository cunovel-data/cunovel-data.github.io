Nash and Abby were waiting for their various athletic practices to begin, and I was trying to stall until I\u0027d be in the clear to catch up with Brandon and take him to Penny for Your Thoughts. I glanced out one of the windows and spotted a woman with long gray hair and bundled up in a tan parka roaming our campus sidewalk as if she was looking for someone in particular.\n I pressed my face closer to the glass and recognized it was Dr. Meadows.\n \"What is she doing here?\" Ivy asked, also spotting the psychic.\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" I said. \"I better find out.\"\n \"Why would you want to do that?\"\n I headed down the bleachers and raced ahead before my friends could follow me. I opened the gymnasium doors and caught up to the psychic.\n \"What are you doing here?\" I whispered.\n \"You didn\u0027t show up at my store. I was concerned something happened to you,\" she said.\n \"I\u0027ve been trying to convince him to see you. It\u0027s taking some time. But I think he will.\"\n \"That is great,\" she said. \"But it has to be soon.\"\n \"We discovered it\u0027s in his blood,\" I said softly. \"The lycan lineage goes generations back.\"\n \"Which one is he?\" she asked. \"No, wait - don\u0027t tell me.\"\n Just then my friends, their beaux, and Nash opened the gymnasium doors. Dr. Meadows pointed to Nash.\n I half laughed.\n \"I must see him at night,\" she said urgently, looking at Nash.\n \"But it\u0027s not a full moon again for weeks.\"\n \"I know, but this way I can document him before and after. I\u0027ll bring my equipment.\"\n \"Equipment?\" It sounded painful and at the very least intrusive.\n I was desperate to find a cure for Brandon\u0027s condition; however, at what cost I wasn\u0027t sure.\n \"I must have documentation,\" Dr. Meadows said, stumbling on her words. \"It will be okay, I promise.\"\n \"What kind of documentation?\" I said. \"He needs to sign something?\" I pried.\n \"Nothing invasive. Just something I can replay. To make sure what he is experiencing is real.\"\n \"I can guarantee you it\u0027s real,\" I said hurriedly.\n My friends were staring at us. Dr. Meadows stared back as if she was examining Nash.\n Then she turned her attention to me. \"I need proof in order to find out how to deal with it.\"\n I didn\u0027t want my true love to be filmed, hooked up to electrodes or possibly other torture devices.\n \"I was hoping for a potion,\" I said. \"Or some charm he could wear around his neck.\"\n \"If you are hoping for a cure, this is the only way.\"\n I left Dr. Meadows and returned to my friends.\n \"What is she doing here at school?\" they asked.\n \"She was looking for a werewolf,\" I said truthfully. \"That woman is so crazy.\"\n Nash continued to watch Dr. Meadows until she got into her car and drove off.\n When I met Brandon after school, I admitted to him that Dr. Meadows had shown up at school and that she wanted to document him. I didn\u0027t want to trick him into doing something he wasn\u0027t prepared for or willing to participate in.\n \"What does she want to do?\" he asked, anxiously waiting by his Jeep.\n \"I\u0027m not sure - she wants to see you soon. Since the full moon won\u0027t be for a few more weeks, she wants a record of you during both times. It could be as simple as asking you questions, or as much as...\"\n \"As what?\"\n \"I\u0027m not sure. Ivy and Abby caught up to us and I didn\u0027t want them to find out what Dr. Meadows was saying.\"\n \"She might want to take pictures or film me?\" he asked.\n I hung my head low. \"I\u0027m not sure what her plans are. All I know is that - uh, I don\u0027t know anything.\" And I was as unsure as Brandon was about whether he should go and meet with her. But today I wanted him to meet Mr. Worthington. Maybe Pine Tree Village might have more answers for him.\n We hopped into Brandon\u0027s Jeep and headed out his private drive and out of Riverside. We were stopped at the traffic light by the school when I noticed the car next to us was Nash\u0027s. I ducked down.\n \"What\u0027s wrong?\" Brandon asked.\n \"It\u0027s Nash. He\u0027s in the car next to us. I don\u0027t want him to see me.\"\n \"I thought you weren\u0027t seeing him anymore.\"\n \"I\u0027m not.\"\n \"Then what\u0027s the big deal?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know.\"\n The light changed and Nash tore off.\n I sat up. Brandon pulled into the lot of a nearby park.\n \"What are you doing?\" I asked.\n \"I\u0027m going to take you back,\" he said, turning the steering wheel.\n \"I don\u0027t want to go back. I want you to meet Mr. Worthington.\"\n \"I can find him on my own,\" he said.\n \"I\u0027m sorry. I just reacted without thinking.\"\n But Brandon was hurt.\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" I said. \"Everything has been happening so fast, that\u0027s all.\" It was so unfair. I ran the risk of losing my lifelong friends for a guy I\u0027d only known a short time. I wasn\u0027t sure what to do. I just knew I wanted all of them in my life.\n \"I don\u0027t blame you, Celeste. I don\u0027t want to put you in a position you aren\u0027t ready to be in.\"\n Brandon pushing me away only made my need to be with him even greater. Overcome with sadness, I turned away from him and stared out the window. A couple strolled hand in hand in the park. The girl snuggled up to her boyfriend as he gazed back adoringly.\n \"You must hate me,\" I said. \"I invited you to a party where you didn\u0027t have a good time. You saved me from a wolf pack that left your hand maimed. I make you feel like an outsider in your own car. And the worst thing of all - because of that moonlit kiss - you\u0027ve turned into a - \"\n Brandon took my chin and drew me to him. \"It\u0027s okay, Celeste. I think you feel you have the world\u0027s problems on your shoulders.\"\n He brushed my hair away from my face. \"You don\u0027t have to worry so much about what is right for Ivy, Nash, or me. Just what is right for you.\"\n Brandon was the first guy I\u0027d ever met who understood me. If I turned away from him now, I knew I\u0027d regret it for the rest of my life.\n \"Please, take me with you to see Mr. Worthington.\"\n Brandon parked the Jeep at Pine Tree Village Retirement Community.\n When we entered the building we heard a commotion coming from one of the hallways and nurses were running to someone\u0027s aid.\n Suddenly there was the sound of an ambulance pulling up outside. Paramedics wheeled in a gurney to the assisted living floor. I dashed down the hallway, my own heart almost stopping.\n The paramedics parked the gurney next to Mr. Worthington\u0027s door.\n Tears welled up in my eyes. I turned to Brandon.\n The color had washed out of his face. He\u0027d been so close to finding a relative he\u0027d never known and an answer to his condition that perhaps no one else could reveal.\n He held on to my shoulder and I melted into his chest.\n Just then Mr. Worthington stepped out of his room. I almost fainted.\n \"You\u0027re alive!\" I said.\n \"I hope so,\" he answered. \"This place isn\u0027t my idea of heaven.\" He told us that Mr. Lucas, his ninety-three-year-old next-door neighbor, had fallen and broken his hip.\n I was surely unhappy to hear that Mr. Lucas was hurt - but grateful to know Mr. Worthington was all right. I gave the elderly man a hug so hard, I was afraid I might break him.\n \"I have someone I\u0027d like you to meet,\" I said, and we walked into his room.\n \"You have a boyfriend?\" he said, trying to make me blush. \"I knew there was something different about you... I told you that before.\"\n Now I was blushing.\n \"This is Brandon Maddox,\" I said to Mr. Worthington, pleased to introduce the two. \"His mother is Claire Worthington. This is your great-grandson.\"\n Mr. Worthington\u0027s face went white, as if he\u0027d just seen a werewolf. I was afraid he was going to have a heart attack right there and then.\n Brandon extended his wounded hand to shake. Mr. Worthington eyed the scar and gently shook Brandon\u0027s hand.\n \"I haven\u0027t seen you since you were a little baby,\" Mr. Worthington said.\n \"I\u0027m so glad to meet you - I mean see you... again.\" Brandon smiled. \"My father said my mother\u0027s family moved away from Legend\u0027s Run.\"\n \"We all did,\" said Mr. Worthington. \"But I moved back a short time ago.\"\n Mr. Worthington and Brandon sat together. I beamed with delight as my two friends began to converse. Brandon didn\u0027t look like the lonely guy in our high school lunchroom or a lone wolf in the woods anymore.\n \"Your mother was a gorgeous girl,\" Mr. Worthington began. \"We were all thrilled when she got married and settled down. I only met your father a few times, but I remember him as being a brilliant man.\"\n \"Yes,\" Brandon said. \"He\u0027s a scientist.\"\n \"After you were born, she seemed to get restless. Maybe she couldn\u0027t handle the good things in life. And then she left, and we never heard from her again. \"\n Brandon nodded.\n \"I always said it was in her blood. Something wild, not normal.\"\n \"Do you think it might be the trait of your great-grandfather?\" I asked, hinting toward Brandon\u0027s nocturnal condition.\n \"I always blamed him for the Worthington wild streak. But we all have to take responsibility for our own actions.\"\n \"I agree with you,\" Brandon said.\n \"You didn\u0027t tell him what I told you yesterday?\" Mr. Worthington asked, almost embarrassed.\n \"I sort of...\"\n \"Well, no one believes an old man,\" he said.\n \"I do,\" Brandon said. \"I believe you.\"\n Mr. Worthington\u0027s face lit up. \"You are the spitting image of my son, Harry. He believed in ghost stories, too.\"\n \"Was your great-grandfather ever cured?\" I asked.\n \"No, and that\u0027s why I was always convinced it ran in our blood.\"\n \"I appreciate your taking the time to talk to me,\" Brandon said politely.\n \"That\u0027s all I have is time. Besides, it is so nice to finally have family in Legend\u0027s Run again.\"\n Brandon extended his hand again. Mr. Worthington took it and hugged Brandon.\n \"I\u0027d like us to meet again,\" Brandon said.\n \"I\u0027d like that, too,\" Mr. Worthington said. \"You know where to find me. I\u0027m here twenty-four hours a day.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/once-in-a-full-moon-full-moon-1/page-24.html","bookId":2148,"book":{"id":2148,"title":"Once in a Full Moon (Full Moon #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Once in a Full Moon \n (Full Moon #1) \n Celeste Parker is used to hearing scary stories about werewolves—Legend\u0027s Run is famous for them.
