{"id":96343,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"Pine Tree Village Retirement Community was a nondescript two-story brown brick building that could have doubled for an apartment building. It included assisted living, independent units, and a full nursing wing and was about ten minutes north from my house. I enjoyed volunteering at the nursing home. If I had a dismal day at school or was struggling with Nash, I forgot my worries. These seniors were very different from the seniors at my school. Most of the residents were happy to see a fresh, young face. And even though many of them told me the same story over and over, it was interesting to hear the tales of past generations in Legend\u0027s Run or cities and countries I\u0027d never visited. Abby and Ivy, convinced wrinkles were contagious, refused to set foot in the senior community, and Nash was always too busy, practicing, playing, or preparing for sports. I knew it was unlikely he\u0027d come to visit other people\u0027s grandparents. That didn\u0027t make my friends bad, but it would have been cool if I could have shared the experience with them. It was something I\u0027d always done on my own. Mr. Worthington was my favorite resident at Pine Tree Village. For a gentleman who was eighty-nine years old, he was quite cute. Mr. Worthington was alert, mobile, and in shape. We walked the hallways or outside commons areas together. He always dressed in khaki pants and a cardigan sweater and kept his fuzzy white hair neatly combed. Every time I visited Pine Tree Village, I was always greeted by the receptionist, who had me sign in and pointed me to an area where the staff could use an extra hand. Today\u0027s visit was extra special. It was Halloween and I\u0027d dressed as Little Red Riding Hood. I wore a red hoodie, the arms loosely tied around my neck and the body as a cape, along with a black bodice, white T-shirt, and red flippy skirt. I finished off my fairy-tale look with white folded socks and a pair of Juliette\u0027s black pumps she\u0027d left behind in her closet. It wasn\u0027t a good idea to pass out candy to the residents, so I came with \"Happy Halloween\" pins I\u0027d made instead. I grabbed a small basket my mom used for magazines and stuck a loaf of bread in it. The normally hospital white lobby was decorated with black and orange streamers, cotton-candy-like spiderwebs, and ghost, mummy, and black-cat die cuts. A sign posted in the lobby read: HALLOWEEN DANCE AT 7 P.M. I teetered over to the reception desk, where I was welcomed by a very friendly witch. \"You look great,\" Sally said through blackened-out teeth. I could barely hold my laughter inside as the straitlaced receptionist offered me a tray of pumpkin cookies. \"I\u0027ll grab one on the way out,\" I said. \"Little Red,\" I heard a man\u0027s voice call. I didn\u0027t even respond to my new name until I heard it called again. \"Little Red, over here.\" An elderly man wearing werewolf fangs, a brown-tipped nose, and a fluffy brown wig was standing a few yards away in the lobby next to a grand piano. I almost didn\u0027t recognize Mr. Worthington at first, but his brown cardigan sweater and khaki pants gave him away. \"Happy Halloween,\" I said, handing him a button. \"It\u0027s Halloween?\" he asked. \"No one told me.\" I laughed at the elderly werewolf. I really adored Mr. Worthington. His youthful spirit was like a chandelier illuminating a darkened room. \"Let me help you,\" I said, pinning the button on his sweater. \"I\u0027m not sure I should be seen with a wolf, much less a werewolf. The residents will think we planned this.\" \"Let them think what they want,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve never seen a prettier girl in red.\" I blushed to match the color of my hoodie. \"Well, I\u0027ve never seen such a kind-looking werewolf,\" I commented back. \"So you\u0027ve seen one?\" he asked seriously. \"The closest thing I\u0027ve seen to a werewolf was when my sister, Juliette, tried to perm her own hair.\" Nurse Bridget, the head nurse on the first floor, walked by. Overhearing the final part of our conversation, she stepped over. \"Charlie, are you going on about werewolves again?\" she asked, putting her arm around him. \"You don\u0027t want to frighten Celeste away. She\u0027s our only steady volunteer.\" \"I haven\u0027t said a word. No one wants to listen to an old man, anyway.\" \"That\u0027s okay,\" I assured Nurse Bridget. \"I promise I won\u0027t be too frightened.\" \"Every Halloween,\" she said, \"Charlie tells us about the Legend\u0027s Run werewolf. Someone says they saw something furry in the woods years ago and people can\u0027t stop talking about it. It\u0027s like the Loch Ness Monster. A big hoax.\" \"My boyfriend was just telling my friends and me about that recently.\" \"So you already know?\" Mr. Worthington asked. \"I guess as much as anyone else knows. But I\u0027d love to hear about it from you.\" Mr. Worthington brightened, knowing he finally had a captive audience. \"Celeste,\" Nurse Bridget said in an apologetic tone, \"I\u0027d love it if you could visit with some of the other residents. I\u0027m sure they would be delighted. Mr. Worthington, can you tell her the story later?\" \"Of course,\" Mr. Worthington said. \"It\u0027s one thing I never forget. Now, where I left my glasses - that I can\u0027t remember.\" \"I won\u0027t be long,\" I said. I didn\u0027t want to abandon Mr. Worthington, but I had a number of pins I had to pass out and was more worried about upsetting Nurse Bridget. I pinned, hugged, and took pictures with as many residents as I could find. When I returned to the lobby, I found the elderly werewolf sleeping on a sofa. I was tempted to sit down and take off my painful pumps, since I was exhausted, but I knew I\u0027d have as difficult a time getting up as he would. I grabbed a small blanket from an adjacent chair and placed it on his lap. \"Is it time for dinner?\" he asked, suddenly stirring. \"Yes, and it\u0027s time for me to go - \" \"So soon?\" \"I\u0027m sorry it took so long,\" I said. \"But I can walk you to the dining room.\" \"What did I do to deserve such a beautiful escort?\" he asked kindly. \"You were going to tell me your story,\" I replied eagerly. \"Oh yes. You remind me of my wife when she was very young. We met here in Legend\u0027s Run.\" I nodded. I\u0027d heard that story many times but tried to pay attention as if I were listening to it for the first time. \"When we were young, Legend\u0027s Run was still a farming and mill town along the river. Not like now, where custom homes dot the landscape. \"But in the last fifty years the mill closed and people moved away from the town and came from the neighboring cities and developed the eastern side of Legend\u0027s Run. The Westside farmers continue to maintain their land. The east side became too congested and Riverside\u0027s commercial property too vacant. We moved away to New York, and eventually the rest of the Worthington family moved on, too.\" My eyes had half glazed over and I tried my best to listen, as I\u0027d heard this story countless times. \"Did you miss it here?\" I asked when he paused. \"Yes. And so did my wife. I promised her we\u0027d return to Legend\u0027s Run to ride out our years that remained. I am a man of my word,\" he said with a grin. There was one story I hadn\u0027t heard from Mr. Worthington. \"And the werewolf? Did he live on the Westside or the East?\" The elderly man perked up even more. He was poised to tell his tale. \"The creature calls the woods his home. Where he can hide from curious people and most importantly from the threat of the full moon. Since the moon can appear to us as full for several days, it makes the werewolf that much more tormented. It was many years ago when he was first spotted in one of the tree-filled areas along Riverside,\" he whispered. \"But you must never go in the woods alone, a girl like you.\" We reached the dining room, and a staff member approached Mr. Worthington. The dining room was full of residents and staff wearing my handmade pins. \"It\u0027s the Legend\u0027s Run werewolf,\" the aide announced. Several residents clapped. I watched as the elderly resident was treated by his peers as if he were a celebrity. \"Please remind him to remove those fangs before he eats,\" I said to the aide as I made a weary exit. That night Ivy hosted a Halloween party at her ��ber-house - five bedrooms, a three-car garage, and a basement that could entertain our entire school. Ivy opened the door dressed like a runway model, in a black-and-white minidress and white patent-leather go-go boots. Abby stood next to her brandishing a big smile, two pigtails, and a borrowed cheerleading uniform - complete with an \"LR\" letter and spirit buttons. I felt worse for the wear in my homemade costume. \"I want to go back and change,\" I said, still standing on the stoop. \"What gives?\" Ivy said. \"You look so cute!\" \"I...\" \"Get in here,\" Ivy said. \"No, I think I\u0027d feel better if I changed into something else.\" \"Your outfit is ten times more creative than ours,\" Abby said. \"But - \" \"No buts! Just get yours in here.\" She took my wrist and dragged me inside. There were already a few of our classmates milling about her home, trying to talk over the pounding music. \"Have the guys arrived?\" I asked. \"Not yet, but I can\u0027t wait until they do. I\u0027m sure their costumes will be killer.\" \"How was Pine Tree?\" Abby asked. \"I bet one of those old men might leave you something when...\" \"That\u0027s morbid - \" Ivy said. \"That\u0027s not why Celeste volunteers there.\" \"I know,\" Abby said, \"but it could be one of the perks.\" Just then the front door burst open and we could hear Jake and Dylan\u0027s voices. \"They\u0027re here!\" Ivy called. My friends eagerly headed for the door, swishing their miniskirts, and I followed, trying not to scrape my heels on her pristine hardwood floors. Dylan raced around the grand entryway, dressed as Superman. He picked up Abby and she squealed as he pretended to save her. \"And look at your hot outfit!\" Jake said with a twang. He had a piece of straw in his mouth, carried a stuffed cow, and was barefoot. Ivy appeared disappointed and confused. \"What are you?\" she asked. \"Duh, I\u0027m a Westsider,\" he proclaimed. I rolled my eyes. \"You\u0027re so ignorant,\" Ivy whispered, half horrified. \"You\u0027re going to embarrass me at my party.\" \"Have you been to the Westside?\" he asked. \"I know they wear shoes,\" I said, shaking my head. I looked to Ivy for help. She reached into my purse and pulled out my eyeliner. She grabbed Jake\u0027s chin with one hand and with the other drew several circles on his face and quickly colored them in. \"What are you doing?\" Jake asked, annoyed. \"Now you are as you should be,\" Ivy announced. \"A cow!\" Everyone laughed - except, of course, for Jake. \"Where is Nash?\" I asked, anxious to find him. I was looking forward to seeing what he wore. \"Parking the car,\" Dylan said. I imagined at any minute Nash would be running into the house dressed as a superhero, swooping me up in his arms and carrying me off to safety, or a knight taking me as his princess and challenging any guest who vied for my attention to a duel, or even a rock star who\u0027d get down on one knee and serenade me with a love song. Instead, Nash entered Ivy\u0027s foyer as he always did - in jeans and a long-sleeved polo. \"What are you?\" I asked. He checked me out - eyeing my short skirt, bare legs, and high heels. \"I guess I\u0027m the Big Bad Wolf!\" Nash said as he grabbed me around the waist and pulled me to him. \"Grr,\" he said with a growl. The partygoers around us broke out in laughter, as if Nash were a headlining comedian. But I didn\u0027t think his joke was funny. I felt awkward and even let down, but I didn\u0027t want my true feelings to spoil the party. I did my best to disguise my disappointment by making myself busy and handing out drinks in Ivy\u0027s airplane-hangar-size kitchen. I watched as Abby and Ivy talked, giggled, and snuggled with their boyfriends. I was excited and flushed and giddy many times when I was with Nash, but I felt something was lacking that my friends had. \"What\u0027s with you?\" Nash asked. \"You seem aloof.\" \"I\u0027m not, I\u0027m just helping Ivy out,\" I said. \"Ivy\u0027s making out with Jake. The only thing you can be helping her out with now is giving her an oxygen tank.\" It was odd; Nash and I seemed to sense each other\u0027s feelings when those around us weren\u0027t as in tune. I was attempting to refill the ice when he took the silver monogrammed bucket from me. \"What\u0027s up, Parker?\" \"Nothing,\" I said with a forced smile. \"You\u0027re mad that I didn\u0027t come in costume?\" he asked. \"I\u0027m not mad...\" \"But disappointed.\" I shrugged my shoulders. \"I didn\u0027t know it meant that much to you,\" he said. I gazed down at my shoes. He took my chin and raised it so I was facing him. \"I guess I should have... it just seems so silly,\" he said. He glanced at the crowd, then back at me. \"I don\u0027t want to wear a clown wig or Darth Vader mask. You\u0027d think I\u0027d look ridiculous.\" \"You\u0027re afraid of what I\u0027d think?\" I asked, surprised. \"I guess. You and everyone else.\" \"Nash, you are gorgeous,\" I said. \"No matter what you wore, no one would be laughing at you.\" It was funny to me that deep down inside, the all-star athlete of Legend\u0027s Run High still was insecure. \"Are you just charming me?\" I asked. \"Did it work?\" he wondered aloud. I couldn\u0027t help but smile. But before I knew it, Nash kissed me and I was quickly lost in his lips. At that moment I no longer cared how he was dressed.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/once-in-a-full-moon-full-moon-1/page-4.html","bookId":2148,"book":{"id":2148,"title":"Once in a Full Moon (Full Moon #1)","description":"Storyline: Once in a Full Moon (Full Moon #1) Celeste Parker is used to hearing scary stories about werewolves—Legend\u0027s Run is famous for them.
