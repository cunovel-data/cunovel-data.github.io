{"id":96349,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"When I arrived in English class I spotted a shiny object lying on my desk. As I drew closer, I realized it was my cell phone. \"Someone found it!\" Ivy said, discovering it, too. Brandon wasn\u0027t in class, but his backpack was leaning against his desk. Just then Brandon sauntered into class. He was wearing an NHL jersey over an oatmeal-colored thermal and black fingerless gloves. I thought it was quite a cool look, but I knew the gloves were to cover up the horrible mauling he\u0027d received a few days before. I felt such sympathy for him and the wound he\u0027d incurred, but I also felt electrified by his presence. An immediate buzzing tingled all over my skin. Before I knew it, I was oversmiling and hypertalking to Ivy as if I were onstage performing for an audience. I didn\u0027t even know why I was doing it, but I couldn\u0027t help myself. I didn\u0027t dare make contact - eye, verbal, or any other kind. Brandon must have felt the same. In my peripheral vision, I saw him take his seat. I was dying to see if he noticed me. Instead, I held the cell phone in my hand. I imagined where it had been. In his coat pocket? Maybe at his home by his bed. At some point, he had held it in his hand, as I was doing now. I was such a love-struck girl and yet I couldn\u0027t control my ridiculous feelings. Finally, I put the phone in my back pocket. \"Not so fast,\" Mrs. Clark said. It was against school rules to have a cell phone in class. And though I was a good student, Mrs. Clark wasn\u0027t about to bend the rules for me. \"I\u0027ll return it to you after class.\" Abby whispered to Ivy. Then Ivy whispered to me. \"Brandon is wearing fingerless gloves.\" \"So?\" I said. \"Don\u0027t you think it\u0027s odd?\" \"No. It is cold out,\" I defended. \"Maybe he got a tat,\" Abby said. \"On his hand?\" I asked. \"On his knuckles,\" Abby corrected. \"Yes, that\u0027s big with the juvies,\" Ivy said. \"There is no evidence he\u0027s a juvie,\" I said. \"You both watch too much TV.\" \"He\u0027s just not like us,\" Abby said. \"It\u0027s like he doesn\u0027t want to fit in with the rest of us - or even try to.\" \"Why should he?\" I asked. \"It\u0027s not like anyone is overly friendly toward him.\" \"I think he\u0027s trying to hide something,\" Ivy theorized. \"He doesn\u0027t make eye contact, he sits alone, and now he\u0027s all about coats and gloves in class.\" \"Yes... I\u0027m sure that\u0027s it,\" I said. \"Has to be hiding something, otherwise it\u0027s not worth discussing.\" \"You are so right,\" Ivy said with a smile. \"What could it be?\" Abby asked. I was the only one who knew what Brandon was hiding. And I wasn\u0027t about to tell. By lunchtime, Jake and Dylan were showing signs of strain, trailing Ivy and Abby and holding their girlfriends\u0027 trays, backpacks, and purses. The students laughed as they passed by, and so did I. They were doing their best to live up to \"servants for a day.\" Nash grabbed a burger from the line and passed Brandon. \"Hey, dude - what\u0027s with the gloves?\" Nash said. \"We are inside, you know.\" Brandon paused. I wasn\u0027t sure what he was going to say. I\u0027m hiding a wound I received while saving your girlfriend\u0027s life? Didn\u0027t she already tell you? But he didn\u0027t answer. \"Wolf got your tongue?\" Nash challenged. \"Don\u0027t be rude!\" I said to Nash. \"I was just wondering, is that the new fashion in Riverside?\" Nash asked. Abby, Ivy, Dylan, and Jake remained at Nash\u0027s side. Brandon was alone. \"You can tell me,\" Nash said. Brandon remained silent. \"Or maybe you\u0027re trying to hide something,\" Nash taunted. I pulled Nash away. \"Sorry. He got an A in football but an F in manners,\" I said to Brandon. I continued to lead Nash back to our usual table. We sat down and Jake and Dylan began cutting my friends\u0027 salads. \"You aren\u0027t going to feed them, too, are you?\" Nash asked. \"I hadn\u0027t thought of that,\" Abby said with a laugh. \"So what did you have Nash do as your servant?\" Ivy asked. \"So far, nothing.\" He grinned triumphantly. \"And the day is half over.\" \"Nothing?\" Dylan asked, outraged. I\u0027d thought about it all day. What would I make Nash do? I could carry my own purse and backpack. I guess the point was to humiliate them and be able to order them around like we couldn\u0027t normally. Nash wasn\u0027t used to taking orders, and I wasn\u0027t used to giving them. I was the kind that let my opponent win a board game for fear they might feel bad if they lost. \"You have to make him do something,\" Jake urged. \"Yes, and it better be good,\" Dylan threatened. \"Okay. Okay,\" I finally said. My friends waited for my command. Nash tensed up, sure I was going to order him to run naked through the cafeteria. I wasn\u0027t sure, however, if he\u0027d object to such a stunt. \"I told you I want you to have a party,\" I said. \"That\u0027s it?\" Nash replied happily. \"I always have parties. No big deal.\" \"That\u0027s not all,\" I said. \"I haven\u0027t provided you with the guest list.\" \"Oh. Is it boys only?\" Jake asked. \"You getting to hang out with the entire basketball team?\" \"No, maybe it\u0027s only Nash,\" Dylan said. \"That\u0027s not much of a party,\" Jake said. \"Yeah?\" Nash finally said. \"You\u0027ll invite the usual crowd. Plus one special guest.\" \"Who\u0027s that?\" he asked. \"You were just talking to him,\" I said. \"Brandon. The guy with fingerless gloves.\" \"Are you kidding?\" Nash asked, slapping the table. \"That\u0027s not it,\" I said. \"I want you to march over there and apologize to him for your behavior. And then, invite him to your party.\" \"You want me to kiss him, too?\" \"Now, that\u0027s a good idea!\" Dylan said. I was beaming. Even my best friends were thrilled. \"Wow - we had it easy,\" Jake said. \"You have to apologize to a Westsider in front of the whole school.\" \"Apologize for what?\" Nash was fuming. \"Hey, man, we lived up to our bargain,\" Dylan said. \"Now it\u0027s your turn.\" \"I don\u0027t want that jerk running around my house,\" Nash said. \"What if he steals something?\" \"What if he doesn\u0027t?\" I replied. \"You\u0027re kidding me, right?\" he said. I shook my head. My friends grinned. We watched as Nash rose and headed over to Brandon. As Nash got close to Brandon\u0027s table, the other students, one by one, became aware of the unusual occurrence and watched with awe. When Nash reached Brandon\u0027s table, Brandon appeared skeptical. The whole lunchroom was prepared for a fight. \"Hey, dude - \" Nash began. \"I\u0027m... uh...\" He cleared his throat. \"About the glove comment...\" Brandon rose. Nash looked back at me. I nodded. Then he turned to Brandon. \"I\u0027m sorry.\" Brandon was as surprised as the rest of the lunchroom. The staff even breathed sighs of relief, knowing that they wouldn\u0027t have to break up a fight. \"No problem,\" Brandon finally said. \"And I\u0027m having a party this weekend,\" Nash continued painfully. \"You can bring some friends.\" \"Uh... Okay - \" Nash pulled a face as he walked over to us. Brandon gazed at me, and I couldn\u0027t help but smile in return. I sat at my computer and attempted to work on my essay on folklore and distract myself from my Brandon Maddox obsession. The bite of a wolf. The full moon. A howl on a dark and dreary night. Everything wolf-related only reminded me of him more. As if that wasn\u0027t enough, I\u0027d been clinging to my cell phone, the very same one he possessed. I\u0027d never felt this guy-crazy before. \"Why don\u0027t you put that down?\" my mom said that evening at dinner. I had my fork in one hand and my phone in the other. \"I\u0027m afraid I may lose it,\" I said. \"I think you might be a little overprotective of it. I\u0027m glad you found it, but it\u0027s not necessary to hold it twenty-four/seven,\" my mom said. I tried my best to eat, but my stomach was in knots. Ever since we\u0027d gone to Penny for Your Thoughts, I felt like my life was out of control. First the wolves in the snowstorm, Brandon Maddox rescuing me, his wound, and now my ridiculous obsession with him. I couldn\u0027t help but blame Dr. Meadows and her strange fortune for getting me into this situation in the first place. What exactly had she said? Beware of the woods... of the sounds of howling. There could be outsiders who will turn... underneath the glow of the full moon. And then, when she\u0027d grabbed me on the way out the door, she\u0027d added, Beware of a kiss under the full moon. It will change your life forever. The snow. The woods. Howling. A full moon. Could she have really seen the strange events before they unfolded? Maybe not. It was November, so it wasn\u0027t that unforeseen that it might snow. Legend\u0027s Run had a wolf population, so seeing one wouldn\u0027t be as shocking as coming upon a zebra. And the moon? It was full twelve times a year. But a kiss? Brandon Maddox was the outsider, but I could only dream of kissing him. What did that part of the prediction mean? I imagined the party Nash was going to host. This time, since he\u0027d lost the dare, he\u0027d have to be as kind to his Riverside guests as he was to his own players on the field. This could be a big step for Nash, opening his home to someone outside his comfort zone. Nash usually only thought about himself. Maybe this would be an opportunity for him to expand his tightly knit social circle. An opportunity for him to grow. If Nash could get along with Brandon, maybe at last the Westside and Eastside could be Oneside.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/once-in-a-full-moon-full-moon-1/page-10.html","bookId":2148,"book":{"id":2148,"title":"Once in a Full Moon (Full Moon #1)","description":"Storyline: Once in a Full Moon (Full Moon #1) Celeste Parker is used to hearing scary stories about werewolvesâ€”Legend\u0027s Run is famous for them.
