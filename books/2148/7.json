{"id":96346,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"Dr. Meadows\u0027s words haunted me. Her messages to me were so specific yet, at the same time, mysterious. My reading had not been anything like my friends\u0027. It wasn\u0027t about my personality but rather about events. The snow. The woods. Howling. The moon. A kiss? Not only did I get a crazy fortune, but I\u0027d blown my allowance for the entire week on foolishness. As we dished by the car, Abby and Ivy cracked up. \"I thought she was great!\" Ivy said. \"She was so right on with me.\" \"Well, it wasn\u0027t hard to figure out that you are athletic,\" I said to Abby. \"And that you are a fashion diva,\" I stated to Ivy. \"Then how do you explain yours?\" Ivy asked. \"Hocus-pocus,\" I said. \"She had to throw in something to get our money\u0027s worth.\" \"I can\u0027t wait to tell Nash what she said,\" Ivy said. \"He better stay away from you and the woods.\" \"Oh, great - I\u0027m going to be late to volleyball practice,\" Abby said, checking her phone. \"If I\u0027m late, I\u0027ll have to do extra laps.\" Ivy didn\u0027t have time to drop me off. Instead she would have to take us all back to school. I wanted some downtime and wasn\u0027t in the mood to travel back to Legend\u0027s Run High. \"Are you sure?\" Ivy asked when I announced I was going to walk home along the bike trail. \"It\u0027s just up the road. I can almost see my house from here,\" I reassured them. My home was less than a mile away, and I thought the cool air in my lungs would perk me up. \"I don\u0027t want you walking home alone,\" Ivy said. \"Please come with us.\" \"We don\u0027t have much time to argue,\" Abby urged. \"She\u0027ll be fine. Her house isn\u0027t that far away.\" I nodded in agreement. As my friends departed, I followed a bike trail that ran between the Westside woods and the main road. As long as I stayed on the path, I\u0027d be home within twenty minutes. I began walking, enjoying the sights of endless trees, the smell of November air, and the sounds of geese flying overhead. Birds\u0027 nests high atop a few of the naked trees were clearly visible. I took out my binder and jotted down a few notes, wanting to remember these elements for future stories. What I didn\u0027t anticipate was the snow. It began with a few flakes. Tiny frosted crystals started to sprinkle down, tapping my fur-lined boots and knit gloves. I was delighted; it made my rural journey that much more enchanting. I loved fresh snow, gentle and whimsical, coloring the sky and trees bright white. The flakes hit my worn binder, dampening my pages, so I stopped and placed it in my backpack. I held out my hand and captured a few flakes in my glove. They didn\u0027t dissolve right away; I could see the tiny, intricate crystal formations. I didn\u0027t remember a snowfall forecast and assumed it would be a light sprinkling for the next few minutes and enjoyed the tapping of snowflakes against my cheeks. As I continued on, the falling flakes grew bigger, dotting the road and grass. The wind picked up and the now quarter-size flakes flew into my hair and face, tickling me. I covered my head with my fleece hood. The wintry scene was beautiful; I could have walked in these conditions for days. But it wasn\u0027t long before the wind blew with huge gusts. I zipped up my hoodie and walked on. The snow increased and pelted down while the wind picked up speed. Instead of the elements painting a blissful picture, they began to fight against me. It was more difficult to view the trees in the distance, and I was annoyed that it was growing colder and getting harder to walk. Within a few minutes, the road was caked with snow. The sky was completely overcast - gray-and-white clouds engulfed it. The trees I could easily make out a few minutes ago were now difficult to see. I realized if I couldn\u0027t see anything, then an approaching driver\u0027s vision would be impaired, too. There wasn\u0027t much room between the road and the bike trail, and I worried a driver might drift off the road now that the lines were invisible. To play it safe, I stepped off the bike path and caught my breath by a row of evergreens. The tall, lush trees blocked most of the wind and snow. The scene around me was breathtaking, but when the gusts grew even stronger and objects only a few yards away became invisible, I decided to press on. I hung on to several evergreens as I walked, using them to guide me forward. Before I knew it, I was grabbing brush instead. I could no longer see the trail or the road. I was frustrated. As the elements were battling against me, all I saw was snow above me, in front of me, and on either side. I could barely keep my eyes open. I was getting really cold and wanted to get home. I walked from tree to tree. I assumed they were paralleling the road and bike trail. I continued on until I grew tired. I stopped by an old oak and leaned against it, catching my breath again. I hadn\u0027t seen anything but trees for a while. Then I realized - where was I? The snowfall was getting worse. I was frightened. I knew the Eastside very well and it was so developed that people, businesses, and homes were in easy reach. I decided to stay put for a few minutes and ride out the storm. When it was clear, I\u0027d get my bearings back and figure out my location. If Ivy and Abby could see me now, they\u0027d surely freak. They\u0027d blame themselves for not insisting I return with them and gripe at me for being so stubborn. One thing was for sure, they\u0027d never let me set foot in Riverside again. There were no signs of civilization - Gerald\u0027s Garage, or a cabin. I was really getting cold. My nose was starting to sting, and the freezing temperatures were penetrating my thin hoodie. Originally, I was only a short distance from my house, and now I\u0027d managed to get myself so turned around, I wasn\u0027t even sure where I was on the planet. My good mood had soured. The weather had gotten the best of me. My chest felt heavy and my breathing became short. My heart pounded. And though I was cold, I started to perspire. I still had no idea where I was and which direction I\u0027d been going. And most important, I didn\u0027t know how I was going to get out. The wind and snow weren\u0027t ceasing; instead, the snow drove down in a blinding heavy fall, and the wind whipped it around me. I decided to call my parents. I knew someone would surely come to my rescue. I pulled out my cell but couldn\u0027t get a signal. I remembered that sinking feeling when I was a kid and I was lost in a store and feared my mom would leave me behind. And though I was older, I felt the same isolation and desperation. I took a deep breath, attempting to calm myself. I tried my phone again, but still no connection. I knew the world was bustling like it normally did in inclement weather. Children coming home from school grabbing their sleds. Adults stocking up on milk and bread at the grocery store. And then there was me - stuck in the middle of nowhere. The solitude was eerie. It wasn\u0027t like when I was inside my bedroom listening to my music, knowing my family would return from a night out. There was no one coming for me. Ivy and Abby were heading in the opposite direction and wouldn\u0027t realize for hours that I wasn\u0027t home. Nash was at practice and wouldn\u0027t contact me until late evening. And my mom thought I was with Ivy and Abby. She wouldn\u0027t wonder where I was until dinner. I should have been home by now. The sun would be setting soon and Mom would be serving a delicious, piping hot meal. Instead, I was growing hungry and was lost in the woods in a major blizzard. The snow began to rise around me. It was only going to get darker and colder. If I wasn\u0027t in trouble now, I knew I would be by nightfall. I\u0027d heard about the seriousness of frostbite and hypothermia. I imagined being forced to spend the night here, taking shelter by a tree. I couldn\u0027t imagine sleeping in the snow without a tent, a down sleeping bag, or a burning fire. With no protection from the wind, snow, and cold, I was sure to freeze. Many creatures called the woods their home; I didn\u0027t know what they might do to a lost intruder. Time seemed to slow down to a grinding halt. Every minute felt like days. Had I been lost for a few moments or a few hours? The bright white sky grew darker. The sun had gone behind the storm clouds, and now I feared it was moments away from setting. \"Help!\" I called. \"Please - can anyone hear me?\" I shouted as loudly as my voice would carry. Snow tapped against my face and eyelashes and fell into my mouth. My calls went unanswered. \"Where am I?\" I shouted. Frustrated, I kicked my boot into the snow. I felt like throwing my phone, too, but I knew it was my only lifeline - even if it didn\u0027t work. I clung to it, hoping once I changed positions it would catch a signal. I had to do something. Snow reflected off the clouds and illuminated part of the woods. I had to make a decision - continue on and hope I reached the road, or backtrack and retrace my footprints? I chose to attempt to try to return the way I came. I was following my wayward footsteps when I heard a cry in the distance. It was the howl of a wolf. I froze. I tried not to panic. For all I knew, the wolf was miles away. I recalled tanning in the summer\u0027s sun with my eyes closed and how voices always seemed much closer than the people talking actually were. This must be the same thing, I tried to assure myself. The air was getting colder. I covered my mouth with my scarf to warm my face, breath, and lungs. The snow and wind continued to push against me but I knew I had to move. I took a few steps. It was as difficult as walking on the moon. Then I heard the howl again. This time it was definitely closer, eyes open or not. I started to walk, briskly this time. Though I was tired and my boots were now heavy, I ventured on. I had a fifty-fifty chance of going farther into the woods or making my way out of it. Normally I wasn\u0027t a gambling person, but I didn\u0027t have a choice. It was hunt or be hunted. When the wolf cried again, I picked up my pace and moved quickly, running through my filling tracks. At this point I didn\u0027t care which way I was going, just as long as it was away from danger. Then I heard another howl. Closer. I wasn\u0027t sure which direction it was coming from. As I hurried along, I clutched my cell phone. My hands were shaking in the cold and in fear. I checked for a signal, but still nothing. I heard a howl again. This time it seemed only yards away. Being lost was one thing. If I could stay calm and possibly ride out the storm, I might be able to figure out the shortest route home. But this was deathly different. There wasn\u0027t time. I had to get out now - or not get out at all. \"Please help me!\" I screamed again. \"I\u0027m lost!\" I only heard the sound of the wind and the tapping of the supersized flakes hitting the trees and ground and my own raspy breathing. Then I heard a different howl. It couldn\u0027t be - another wolf? This time the howl seemed a few feet away and coming from another direction. My heart accelerated. My teeth began to chatter, not because I was cold, but because I was scared to death. The silence only magnified my intense pangs of isolation. I\u0027d never felt so alone and scared. I didn\u0027t want to die. \"Someone - please help me!\" I screamed. \"Help!\" I was blinded, lost, cold, and alone - only I wasn\u0027t as alone as I would have liked. Branches crunched and twigs crackled, and the sound of heavy breathing was near. Then I heard a deep, maddening, and fiery growl. This time it was coming from behind me. I immediately stopped in my tracks, fear penetrating through me. Hesitantly, I turned. Between the heavy-falling snow appeared a ghastly sight - four pairs of gray, beastly eyes. I\u0027d never been so close to wolves as I was now - not even in a zoo with a steel cage between us. The wolves crept closer. I could see their wet noses and the breath coming from their snouts. They licked their lips. Terror shot through me like piercing icicles. I quietly positioned my cell phone. Finally. A connection! My fingers shaking, I began to press the number nine. Then I managed to press the number one. The leader of the pack growled, exposing his white fangs and black gums. Another wolf barked. Startled, I flinched. The phone fell into the snow. I learned in Health and Safety class that in the unlikely event that a person encountered a wolf, the person should try to make themselves appear bigger. I stood on my tiptoes, which was difficult to do in the piling snow and my bulky, furry boots, and raised my hands in the air. \"Help!\" I called. \"Please, someone - help!\" I took a few steps backward, making sure I didn\u0027t turn my back on them. They paced back and forth, watching. My arms became heavy; I couldn\u0027t keep them up much longer. I hummed a sweet tune to myself, hoping it would relax me and the wolves. There was a break in the overcast sky. The full moon peeked out. Celestial and glowing, it radiated its magnificent brilliance as if it were trying to comfort me. But I was far from comforted. The wolves weren\u0027t budging, and my circulation was draining out from my fingertips. It would only be moments until I\u0027d have to bring down my arms, and then I knew they\u0027d surely attack. I felt a presence behind me and my breath stopped. Just like that, I was surrounded. I was frozen with fear, my heart pounding, my fingers still shaking, my lips quivering. I closed my eyes and began to pray. I wondered how my parents would find me - if they\u0027d even find me. I imagined Ivy and Abby spending the next three years shopping without me and Nash finding comfort in someone else\u0027s arms. And I realized that in my seventeen years I hadn\u0027t experienced the one thing that had always eluded me - true love. Then whatever that presence was jumped out from behind me. I covered my head and screamed. I heard a lot of scuffling, growling, and howling. It took a few moments for me to even realize I wasn\u0027t in any physical pain. Was I already dead? I peeked out from my defenses. I saw a figure holding a large tree branch. The figure swung at the pack with the branch, running and chasing after the wolves. Growling and the horrible sounds of a struggle raged just beyond my sight. I prayed the man was okay, but I wasn\u0027t sure what was happening just a few yards away in the heavy snow. I heard a crunch, then a male voice yell. All at once, there was a smack and the sound of yelping. Then there was dead silence. I didn\u0027t know if the person was alive. I didn\u0027t hear the wolves. I didn\u0027t hear the man. I waited. I wondered if I should call out to him, but I was afraid this might excite the wolves if they were still there. I didn\u0027t know what to do next. When I didn\u0027t hear a sound, I knew I had to do something. I decided to go farther into the woods and see what had happened. I was terrified of what I might find. Just then, the figure emerged from behind a tree. The guy was alive, out of breath, and exhausted. The snow fell heavily, blocking me from seeing my rescuer. Then, all at once, striking blue eyes shone through the snow. I was even more shocked... it was Brandon Maddox. I was so happy to see someone that I threw my hands up and cheered. Brandon had been fighting the wolf pack with all his strength. The falling snow made it hard to see, the woods made it hard to navigate through, and the cold temperature made it hard to breathe. I\u0027d always thought Brandon was handsome, but now he looked even more magnificent. \"Are you... okay?\" It was the first thing he asked. \"Am I okay? I wasn\u0027t the one fighting a pack of wolves.\" Brandon tossed the branch into the woods. It was then a few dark red drops fell into the lily white snow. \"You\u0027re bleeding!\" I said, pointing to the red stains. \"What?\" He didn\u0027t even look at his hand. \"What are you doing... here?\" he asked. He was still running on adrenaline. \"You\u0027ve been hurt,\" I said. \"We should get you to a doctor.\" He raised his hand. Drops continued to fall into the snow. \"You need to have that looked at,\" I said. \"You might need stitches.\" \"It\u0027s nothing,\" he said. \"You could have rabies,\" I warned. \"I\u0027m fine.\" \"Can I see?\" I asked. \"Uh... sure.\" I hadn\u0027t even spoken to Brandon before now, but words couldn\u0027t express the gratitude I felt discovering anyone - especially him - here with me in the woods. I\u0027d always been drawn to Brandon, and his heroic actions only magnified my feelings. I slowly reached out to him. Our fingers touched and I melted. I took his hand and held it in mine. It was strong and warm even though it was wet from the falling snow. I gently peeled back his ripped glove to examine the wound. There was a bloody gash in the palm of his hand. \"You\u0027ve been bitten!\" I said, alarmed. \"You\u0027ll have to see a doctor. You don\u0027t want it to get infected.\" \"That\u0027s okay - \" he said, trying to shrug off the seriousness of the wound. \"No, you must.\" \"I\u0027m fine.\" \"But you\u0027re still bleeding. I\u0027ll bandage it for you.\" I dug my free hand into my purse and took out a pack of tissues. I applied a few tissues to his hand and unwound my scarf from around my neck. I could feel him staring at me as I tended to his wound. He examined my hair, my face, my lips. Gently, I wrapped the scarf around his hand and tucked in the ends. We stood in the snow - in the middle of the woods, in the middle of Legend\u0027s Run. Brandon Maddox\u0027s hand in mine. Neither one of us was letting go. \"It\u0027s kind of bulky,\" I said, \"but it will do for now.\" I felt so tired. Now, knowing someone was with me, that I wasn\u0027t alone anymore and that I wasn\u0027t hurt, my body started to cave in. Brandon reached out and steadied me with his good hand. \"I could have been - \" I said, realizing the severity of the situation. \"But you - \" It was hard for me to get past the image that plagued my mind - if Brandon hadn\u0027t shown up when he did, I\u0027d have been attacked by a pack of wolves. Instead, he had scared them off. But he\u0027d been bitten. \"I\u0027d take you to a doctor,\" I said. \"But I don\u0027t even know where I am.\" Then Brandon smiled - a terminally seductive smile. The kind smiled by A-list movie stars. The kind that takes one\u0027s breath away. \"I\u0027ll show you,\" he finally said. I let go of his hand. As we started walking, the snowfall began to dwindle. I couldn\u0027t feel my hands, my feet, my legs. They all seemed numb from the event, somehow moving on their own. The flakes became smaller and eventually were more sporadic as we walked in silence. He escorted me through the woods valiantly, as if he knew this piece of land as well as his own home. We reached the snow-covered road. A few cars passed by slowly, their tires splashing the wintry mix. I saw the roof of my house in the distance. I was closer to home than I\u0027d thought. \"My house is just over there.\" I pointed to my subdivision. I was so happy to see my house, I had to fight back tears. \"I don\u0027t know how to thank you. You... saved my life.\" I turned around to embrace my hero, but Brandon had already disappeared.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/once-in-a-full-moon-full-moon-1/page-7.html","bookId":2148,"book":{"id":2148,"title":"Once in a Full Moon (Full Moon #1)","description":"Storyline: Once in a Full Moon (Full Moon #1) Celeste Parker is used to hearing scary stories about werewolves—Legend\u0027s Run is famous for them.
