Nash hung back and laughed.\n My classmates snickered as the jocks roared and snarled.\n \"Have you seen the werewolf?\" I heard someone ask Hayley Phillips.\n \"Doesn\u0027t seem like he\u0027s hitting the Westside,\" she retorted loud enough for Ivy and me to hear.\n Dylan and Jake stopped showing off when Abby bolted into class.\n \"I was almost attacked last night,\" Abby said. \"First my dog. Now me.\"\n \"What happened?\" Ivy asked.\n \"Are you okay?\" I wondered.\n \"After volleyball practice, I left the school gym and this thing jumped out of the bushes at me.\"\n \"What thing?\" Ivy asked.\n \"A thing! A creature.\"\n \"You have to be kidding me,\" Ivy said. \"A creature?\"\n Dylan sat by her and consoled her. \"Abby, it might be best if you kept quiet.\"\n \"Did it touch you?\" I asked, concerned.\n \"No - \" she said. \"I screamed so loud I think I scared it away.\"\n \"What did it look like?\" I asked.\n \"It was evil, that\u0027s all I know. All I saw was dark hair and fangs.\"\n I turned to Brandon. Distress showed on his face. He put his head in his maimed hand and flipped through a textbook.\n Mrs. Clark entered the classroom. \"Everyone, take your seats. You\u0027ll be reading your essays aloud in class today.\"\n \"Abby says she saw the werewolf last night here at school,\" Heidi Rosen said.\n Abby turned to her in horror.\n \"Is there something you\u0027d like to report?\" Mrs. Clark asked.\n \"Yes,\" Abby said. \"Just like Heidi, I saw the Legend\u0027s Run Werewolf.\"\n Heidi glared at Abby as the rest of the students snickered again.\n I couldn\u0027t concentrate on any of the murmuring in the classroom. Brandon wouldn\u0027t be so brazen as to scare Abby. And if he did, what would I do? I wasn\u0027t sure I should feel affection toward a guy who was scaring my friends. But Brandon never hurt me or posed a threat when we were together, so why would he do that to others? It just didn\u0027t make sense.\n After class was over, I tried to catch up to Brandon, but he snuck out quickly and slipped away into the crowd of students. I seemed to be the only one at Legend\u0027s Run High who couldn\u0027t spot the werewolf.\n Later, Ivy and I were in the library gossiping during study hall.\n \"Do you believe Abby really saw a werewolf?\" Ivy asked me.\n Really, I thought she did. But how could I tell Ivy that?\n \"I\u0027m not sure,\" I said instead. \"I think she thinks she saw something. But do you really think a werewolf is running around Legend\u0027s Run?\" I asked her.\n \"I still think there was something bizarro about that wolfman Brandon Maddox and that incident with the wolves. Maybe it\u0027s him.\"\n I paused. \"Does Brandon have fangs?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know. I haven\u0027t made a point of getting that close to him.\"\n \"You really think he\u0027s a werewolf?\" I pressed.\n \"I swear I saw him stare at those wolves and they were staring right back at him. It\u0027s possible. He is from the Westside,\" she said with a laugh.\n I didn\u0027t think my best friend\u0027s comment was funny.\n \"But I think that\u0027s it,\" Ivy continued as if she just realized something. \"Ever since I said that thing about Brandon being weird when the wolves came, Abby\u0027s had to top me. With her dog missing, and now this crazy story. Don\u0027t you see it?\"\n \"I\u0027m not sure I follow.\"\n \"I think Abby\u0027s just trying to get attention,\" she said, fixated on our friend. \"Everyone wants to know her story about seeing a werewolf.\"\n I didn\u0027t reply but listened to my friend rant.\n \"Did you see at lunch the way Dylan and Jake were fawning all over her? And Nash, though he was just hanging back, taking it all in.\"\n I was surprised at Ivy\u0027s being jealous of the attention Abby was receiving.\n \"If she did see something - \" I said.\n \"She didn\u0027t see anything, don\u0027t you get it? She\u0027s made the whole thing up. Just to get attention. It\u0027s so like her.\"\n \"You\u0027re saying Abby lied?\"\n Just then Abby returned to the library from her locker.\n \"This is just between us,\" Ivy said.\n \"Of course,\" I said.\n \"What did I miss?\" Abby said. She always felt left out when Ivy and I were together. In this case, her feelings were accurate.\n After school, I was heading down the stairs when I spotted Brandon. He was standing at the bottom of the landing, out of the way of students. I was startled and surprised he was finally making contact with me.\n \"I have to ask you to come over,\" he said quickly when I reached him. \"It\u0027s important.\"\n Normally, I would have been happy that we\u0027d be together again. But his tone was more stern than romantic.\n \"I\u0027ll be there,\" I said.\n For a brief moment, we locked eyes - his royal blues glistening like raindrops. It was obvious he couldn\u0027t linger like he longed to, but whatever it was he needed to tell me was more important than risking a secret stairwell kiss.\n He escaped into the hallway before I could convince him to stay any longer.\n As I drove from the Eastside to the Westside, I was struck by the number of flyers there were about missing dogs. I couldn\u0027t even count the signs that were taped to the telephone poles along the road. Was a wolf - or werewolf - in fact harming the dogs of Legend\u0027s Run?\n My heart pounded as I drove my car along the Maddoxes\u0027 private drive and past the frozen pond where we\u0027d shared our romantic ice skate together. I wondered what Brandon wanted to tell me. I found him pacing by his guesthouse. I hopped out of the car and raced up to him.\n \"I\u0027ve become a danger,\" he said. \"Everyone is spotting me now.\"\n \"I haven\u0027t seen you - I still think people are just paranoid, scared of the wolves that showed up at school.\"\n \"How can I know when I don\u0027t remember anything?\" He raked his hands through his hair in frustration. \"Your friend Abby. She said I jumped out at her.\"\n \"You haven\u0027t hurt anyone - they\u0027re just scared.\" I tried to ease his mind. \"Besides, there\u0027s no full moon. You\u0027re not transforming into a werewolf. \"\n \"But does that matter anymore? I don\u0027t know what I\u0027ll do next. It\u0027s in my blood - just like Mr. Worthington - Charlie - told me. No one in town is safe from me after sunset.\"\n \"But, Brandon - \"\n \"I can\u0027t remember anything I do at night. I know I\u0027m the one responsible. The only way to cure this is...\"\n We both paused. I wasn\u0027t sure what Brandon\u0027s resolution was going to be and I wasn\u0027t about to hear it. I stared at him squarely in the face, fear and anger tearing through me. \"Not a silver bullet!\" I said. \"That isn\u0027t the solution! And if you think that for a minute - \"\n \"No,\" he said, breaking a smile. \"I\u0027d like a cure that doesn\u0027t involve bullets.\"\n I breathed out a huge sigh.\n \"But since we don\u0027t have a cure...\"\n \"What are you going to do?\" One fear was replaced with another. I could only imagine the love of my life pushing himself further away from me and the town. \"Are you going to leave?\"\n \"No, the idea is to stay. Confined. For the whole night.\"\n \"What do you mean?\"\n \"My grandparents have gone to Florida for a vacation, so they won\u0027t even miss me.\"\n \"Miss you? Where are you going?\"\n \"I\u0027ll need your help.\" He put a heavy-duty padlock in my hand.\n \"What am I supposed to do with this?\"\n \"I rigged this today,\" he said, pointing to several brackets and a latch on the outside of the guesthouse. \"All you have to do is put the lock on just before the sun sets. I don\u0027t think I can bust it. And if I do, at least we tried.\"\n \"But you\u0027ll be locked inside your room all night?\"\n \"That\u0027s the idea.\"\n \"What if something happens and you need help? You\u0027ll be trapped.\"\n \"I\u0027ll call nine-one-one. I have a phone and all the amenities I need. I\u0027ll be fine. It\u0027s the people of Legend\u0027s Run I\u0027m worried about.\"\n \"This isn\u0027t any way to live, Brandon - like a caged animal.\"\n \"I don\u0027t have a choice, Celeste.\" He cupped my face in his hands.\n We sat together in the guesthouse, snuggled together on top of his single bed. I caressed the scar on his hand and snuck in as many kisses as I could before nightfall. The sun began setting behind the trees.\n \"It\u0027s time,\" he said.\n \"But I don\u0027t want to leave.\"\n \"I\u0027m afraid you have to. You can\u0027t stay in here with me.\"\n Brandon gave me a long kiss and shooed me out the door.\n \"I\u0027ll come back before school,\" I said.\n \"Just remember the key,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t want to get detention for being late.\"\n As the sun continued to set, he closed the door.\n Using all my strength, I pressed the padlock closed. I tugged at it several times, making sure it had truly latched.\n I leaned against the door, placing my palm on it. It was as if I could feel Brandon\u0027s energy coming through from the other side.\n \"You better go,\" he finally said.\n \"I don\u0027t want to. You\u0027ll be all alone.\"\n \"It\u0027s better than the alternative,\" he said.\n \"I\u0027ll have my phone with me at all times,\" I assured him. \"Please call me.\"\n \"See you in the morning,\" he said. \"Hopefully I\u0027ll still be here.\"\n I drove off down the long driveway. My stomach felt hollow, leaving Brandon all alone locked away in his room. It was one thing when he was hidden away in the woods. But to me, this was worse.\n My true love was jailed - by his condition and by his own free will. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/once-in-a-full-moon-full-moon-1/page-27.html","bookId":2148,"book":{"id":2148,"title":"Once in a Full Moon (Full Moon #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Once in a Full Moon \n (Full Moon #1) \n Celeste Parker is used to hearing scary stories about werewolves—Legend\u0027s Run is famous for them.
