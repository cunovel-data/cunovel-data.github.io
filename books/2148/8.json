{"id":96347,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"I arrived home breathless, spaced out, and chilled to the bone.\\n\\n \"There you are!\" my mom said, relieved. \"Where have you been?\"\\n\\n I must have looked like a roughed-up snow angel. If I\u0027d been skiing, sledding, or snowboarding - none of which my friends had time for anymore, and Ivy never liked anyway - I would have had layers of clothing, puffy gloves, earmuffs, a knit hat, and a down-filled coat.\\n\\n But this time I was caught in the snow by accident and wasn\u0027t prepared for it.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve been worried sick,\" my mom said as I unzipped my now-white hoodie. Flakes fell on our tiled foyer. I shook the snow off my boots on an inside mat, but I couldn\u0027t feel a thing - my legs and toes were numb. Our dog, Champ, bounded up to me and sniffed my pant legs.\\n\\n \"I called several times,\" my mom continued, \"but you didn\u0027t answer. I was just getting my keys to come and look for you.\"\\n\\n I was so happy to be home, I was speechless. So much had just happened to me since I left Ivy and Abby, I couldn\u0027t process everything. All I knew was I was finally home.\\n\\n My mom pulled off my gloves. \"Your fingers are frozen.\" She warmed them in her hands.\\n\\n \"I got caught in that snowstorm.\"\\n\\n \"I can see that. Are Ivy and Abby okay?\"\\n\\n I nodded. \"I think they missed the storm.\"\\n\\n \"They weren\u0027t with you?\" she asked, surprised.\\n\\n I leaned against the staircase railings and my mom pulled off my boots. I was too tired to hike the stairs to my room. Instead, I sat on them and peeled off my jeans. My mom handed me warm sweatpants and fuzzy slipper socks from the laundry room. Champ licked my cold fingers.\\n\\n I\u0027d never been so happy to be home in all my life. The smell of pasta wafting in from the kitchen was the most pleasant scent I could have imagined. It normally bothered me when my mom fussed over me, but I was so fatigued and cold, I welcomed her care.\\n\\n I followed her into the family room. I plopped down on a sofa and she covered me with a fleece blanket, and Champ curled up at my feet.\\n\\n My mom turned on our gas fireplace and I gladly gazed at our family pictures displayed on the mantel.\\n\\n \"Dinner\u0027s almost ready,\" she said.\\n\\n I could hear her fiddling in the kitchen behind me, but I couldn\u0027t focus on what she was doing. I would have pinched myself to see if I was dreaming - being in the safety of my house with a fluffy family pet instead of staring at a pack of salivating wolves - only I still couldn\u0027t feel my skin.\\n\\n \"She just got home,\" I heard my mom tell my dad when he entered the house.\\n\\n \"That blizzard came out of nowhere,\" he said.\\n\\n I was glad to see my dad and gave him puppy-dog eyes. He touched my face. Even though he\u0027d been outside, his warm hand heated my chilled cheek.\\n\\n \"I think that caught us all off guard,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Dinner\u0027s ready,\" my mom called.\\n\\n Still wrapped in my fleece blanket, I sat down at the dining table and immediately scarfed down an Italian roll.\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t realize I\u0027d been gone so long,\" I announced, glancing at the clock.\\n\\n \"Take your time,\" my mom said. \"You don\u0027t want to choke.\"\\n\\n \"So why weren\u0027t you with Ivy?\" my dad asked.\\n\\n \"I wanted to go straight home. But obviously that didn\u0027t happen.\"\\n\\n \"You walked home?\" my dad asked.\\n\\n \"Yes. Then it started snowing and I ended up in the woods. I saw a wolf. And just at the last moment - \"\\n\\n \"What?\" my dad asked. \"Slow down. Why were you in the woods?\"\\n\\n \"I got lost.\"\\n\\n \"Which woods?\" my mom asked, just as concerned.\\n\\n \"The ones along Riverside.\"\\n\\n \"Riverside?\" she asked, horrified. \"What were you doing there? Where were Abby and Ivy?\" my mom wondered.\\n\\n \"Ivy was driving Abby to her practice before tonight\u0027s game.\"\\n\\n \"This still doesn\u0027t make sense,\" my dad said. \"What were you doing walking in Riverside alone?\"\\n\\n \"Abby, Ivy, and I were getting our fortunes told.\"\\n\\n \"Didn\u0027t the psychic tell you you shouldn\u0027t go into the woods?\" my dad asked, joking. \"Seems obvious enough to me.\"\\n\\n As a matter of fact, Dr. Meadows had warned me. Beware of the woods... of the sounds of howling, she had said. My stomach turned, and it wasn\u0027t from eating too fast. It was strange - her prediction. But it just had to be a coincidence, I assured myself.\\n\\n \"You didn\u0027t answer your cell phone,\" my mom said sharply. \"I was about to drive around when you came in the door.\"\\n\\n \"I tried calling you - but I couldn\u0027t get a signal,\" I defended. \"Then I dropped my phone in the snow....\" I realized I still didn\u0027t have my cell phone. \"I\u0027m really sorry - I think I lost it.\"\\n\\n \"Your cell phone can be replaced,\" she said.\\n\\n \"So... you said you saw a wolf?\" my dad asked.\\n\\n \"Yes. Closer than I\u0027ve ever seen.\"\\n\\n \"How close?\" my mom asked.\\n\\n \"Only a few feet away. And it wasn\u0027t one wolf. It was a pack.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re so lucky they didn\u0027t see you,\" she said, relieved.\\n\\n \"See me? They almost ate me!\"\\n\\n My parents froze.\\n\\n \"They were as close to me as you both are and staring at me like you are now.\" As soon as I said that, I realized it was a mistake.\\n\\n My mom covered her mouth. Then she took my hand. My dad\u0027s brows furrowed.\\n\\n I could see by my parents\u0027 horrified expressions as they imagined their daughter being torn to shreds, I would be lucky if I was ever allowed out of the house again.\\n\\n \"Honey, I\u0027m so happy you weren\u0027t bitten!\" my mom said gratefully. \"Or worse.\"\\n\\n It was then I thought of Brandon. He was bitten and he didn\u0027t seem concerned. He\u0027d been more interested in my well-being than his.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s odd to see a wolf up close like that - so close to town,\" my dad said. \"They usually like to avoid people.\"\\n\\n \"I must have stumbled on their den. They didn\u0027t appear too happy to see me.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d think their den would be farther outside of town. That\u0027s where they\u0027re mostly spotted,\" my dad added.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" I said, taking a drink. \"I only know I saw them and they saw me.\"\\n\\n \"Are you sure they were wolves?\" my mom pressed.\\n\\n \"Do squirrels have fangs?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"Well, we\u0027re glad you\u0027re back home safe,\" my mom continued.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not a forest ranger,\" I said. \"I just know what I saw. I\u0027ve never seen wolves up close. It was terrifying!\"\\n\\n That hit my mom hard. She always wanted to protect me, and I knew it hurt her to have me be in a situation where I\u0027d been afraid and alone.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m so sorry I wasn\u0027t there - \" she said.\\n\\n \"How did you manage to make it out?\" my dad asked. \"Alive? Without a scratch?\"\\n\\n My parents waited for my answer.\\n\\n A guy saved me. Risked his life for mine. A handsome Westsider.\\n\\n I was too exhausted to tell them any more, and it would only add to their endless questions. I always told my parents the truth, no matter what the truth was, but in this case I felt funny about telling them about Brandon. I knew they\u0027d make a fuss - show up at his house, thank him, and insist on taking him out to dinner. It would be embarrassing for him, and I wanted to spare him the gushing parental gratitude. So instead I just skipped to the end. \"The snow began to let up. Eventually I could see our house.\"\\n\\n \"Well, thank goodness it did!\" My mom sighed. \"Thank goodness it did.\"\\n\\n \"I still don\u0027t understand why you were getting your fortunes told,\" my dad said. \"Don\u0027t you girls have homework to do?\"\\n\\n \"It was sort of a dare,\" I tried to explain.\\n\\n \"What did the psychic say?\" my mom asked.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s private,\" I said. \"Like making a wish on your birthday.\"\\n\\n \"Did she say we were going to win the lottery?\" my mom asked. \"Or travel the world?\"\\n\\n \"No. She didn\u0027t say anything about becoming rich or winning a fabulous vacation,\" I replied.\\n\\n \"Well, I\u0027m so happy you are safe,\" my mom said.\\n\\n \"I second that,\" my father affirmed. \"And here\u0027s a fortune for you,\" he said, directing his attention toward me. \"No walking by yourself outside our subdivision anymore. Or you\u0027ll be grounded.\"\\n\\n High school basketball games were one of the biggest events in the Legend\u0027s Run social calendar. There wasn\u0027t much else to do in town, and our team usually put on quite a performance. Almost everyone in town attended the games - except for one person.\\n\\n When I arrived at the game, I scanned the bleachers for Brandon. I saw a few Westsiders, but no heroes.\\n\\n Ivy was waiting for me by the snack stand. The smell of hot dogs, hot chocolate, and popcorn was almost intoxicating.\\n\\n I was bursting to tell her my harrowing story. \"You\u0027ll never believe what happened on my way home,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Were you mugged? I knew I shouldn\u0027t have left you!\"\\n\\n \"No - I got lost.\"\\n\\n \"Lost? You were just down the road from your house.\"\\n\\n \"There was a snowstorm on the Westside and I got caught in it.\"\\n\\n \"Really? We must have just missed it.\"\\n\\n \"Well, I didn\u0027t, and I got disoriented and found myself in the middle of the woods.\"\\n\\n \"What woods?\"\\n\\n \"The ones that run along Riverside.\"\\n\\n Ivy was horrified. \"You could have been killed - you don\u0027t know who lives in there.\"\\n\\n \"No one was living in there,\" I assured her.\\n\\n \"So what happened?\"\\n\\n \"There was a pack of wolves - so close I could see their wet noses!\"\\n\\n Ivy paused. I wasn\u0027t sure she believed me. This wasn\u0027t the usual \"girl meets friend, friends go to mall\" story.\\n\\n \"Really?\" she asked skeptically.\\n\\n \"Yes! Why don\u0027t people believe me?\"\\n\\n \"What people?\"\\n\\n \"My family. Now you.\"\\n\\n \"We all believe you,\" she affirmed.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve never lied before.\"\\n\\n \"I know that,\" she said. \"It\u0027s just that if you met a pack of wolves in the woods, how are you standing here telling me about it?\"\\n\\n She had a point. There was that one significant detail I was leaving out. The detail with the royal blue eyes.\\n\\n \"So, how did you escape the wolves?\" she asked.\\n\\n \"Well...\"\\n\\n \"Yes?\"\\n\\n \"Uh... They eventually heard some noises and ran off.\" It was mostly true.\\n\\n \"Thank goodness!\" She gave me a quick hug. \"Now, that\u0027s the last time we\u0027ll be going to Riverside!\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t have to share every detail of my day with my family and best friend. Perhaps there are some things worth keeping close to one\u0027s own heart.\\n\\n Nash, Jake, and Dylan were doing their pregame warm-ups on the court. Abby was chatting with a few cheerleaders stretching out in the corner and waved us over.\\n\\n The guys were handsome in their blue-and-gold jerseys and shorts. Nash began discussing plays with the coach while Jake and Dylan continued warming up. While Ivy told Abby my story, I scanned the crowd for Brandon.\\n\\n \"You were lost in the woods?\" Abby asked, breaking me out of my trance. \"Can I call you Red? Just like your costume on Halloween. You are so her.\"\\n\\n \"What?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"Little Red Riding Hood. But instead of one wolf, you encountered many.\"\\n\\n \"Seems as if I did,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Then how did you get out?\" she asked. \"They could have killed you!\"\\n\\n \"I know.\"\\n\\n \"Celeste says they just retreated,\" Ivy answered for me.\\n\\n \"Just like that?\" Abby asked.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t really want to talk about it.\"\\n\\n \"Didn\u0027t Dr. Meadows say something freaky about you and the woods and a wolf?\" Abby remembered.\\n\\n \"She did!\" Ivy said.\\n\\n \"That didn\u0027t mean anything,\" I insisted.\\n\\n \"She warned you!\" Abby said with a voodoo glare. \"She is psychic.\"\\n\\n As the buzzer sounded, the three of us climbed the bleachers and watched our beaux take on the Highland Valley Bears.\\n\\n I wasn\u0027t a big fan of basketball, but I did like the sport\u0027s fast pace, and Legend\u0027s Run High had a great team. Although my mind would occasionally drift from one free throw to another, I used some of that time to jot down ideas and thoughts in my spiral binder. But tonight, I had only three things on my mind - the woods, the wolves, and Brandon. I wasn\u0027t even sure throughout the game which team was winning. All I could see was Brandon\u0027s blue eyes shining through the snow when I thought I was on death\u0027s doorstep; his fearless heroics and selfless humility; his coming to my aid like a brave knight does for a princess in peril.\\n\\n The game finally came to an end, and the Legend\u0027s Run Wolverines were victorious over the Bears. I couldn\u0027t help but be disillusioned. Nash\u0027s final swish got more fanfare than a guy in the woods who saved a girl\u0027s life.\\n\\n I watched Nash, Dylan, and Jake tear into chicken and sodas at Wings and Things while my friends and I listened to them retelling their final play of the game. But I didn\u0027t have an appetite. I had butterflies in the pit of my stomach. I felt as if I\u0027d never be able to eat again.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s up?\" Nash finally said to me.\\n\\n Abby told him my story. By this time it was thirdhand. Even with her embellishments, the end was still the same - I\u0027d been as close to a pack of wolves\u0027 dinner as these chicken wings were to our boyfriends\u0027 mouths.\\n\\n \"And that psychic predicted the whole thing?\"\\n\\n \"Even what she was wearing,\" Abby said.\\n\\n \"She did not - \" I tried to tell them.\\n\\n \"What else did she say?\" Jake prodded.\\n\\n The gang waited for my answer. I wasn\u0027t about to tell them the rest.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t remember,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Something about an outsider,\" Ivy chimed in.\\n\\n \"Yes, an outsider,\" Abby repeated.\\n\\n \"Did you see an outsider there?\" Jake asked. \"I wonder what that means.\"\\n\\n I wasn\u0027t about to tell them that I did see an outsider - that he was from the Westside and had the best eyes I\u0027d ever seen.\\n\\n \"Your girlfriend was only moments from the clutches of death!\" Jake teased Nash.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s true,\" Ivy defended. \"She was surrounded by a pack of wolves.\"\\n\\n \"Wolves?\" The color washed out of Nash\u0027s face.\\n\\n \"Yes, wolves,\" Abby said, stressing the severity of the situation.\\n\\n \"The Big Bad Wolf?\" Nash teased, recovering his cool. \"So how did you get out?\"\\n\\n I could tell my friends right there and then that the wolves didn\u0027t retreat but rather were fought off by someone who didn\u0027t run away from wolves or wasn\u0027t frightened by the mere mention of their species. But as the words came to my mouth, I saw that the story might hurt Nash. Once word spread throughout school that there was a real hero in Legend\u0027s Run, the star of the football and basketball teams could never measure up to that feat. And once it was discovered that someone, especially an unpopular Westsider, saved Nash\u0027s girlfriend\u0027s life - something he didn\u0027t do and possibly could never do - it could ruin Nash\u0027s reputation and ego for the rest of our days at Legend\u0027s Run High.\\n\\n \"So... how did you survive it?\" Nash pressed.\\n\\n \"I raised my hands like they told me in school and the wolves eventually went away.\"\\n\\n \"What woods were you in?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"The ones in Riverside,\" Abby answered.\\n\\n \"Why were you in Riverside?\" Nash asked.\\n\\n Abby waved her receipt in his face. \"Servants for a day! Starting tomorrow! Not only am I going to get an A on my English project, but I\u0027m going to get a free massage, too.\"\\n\\n Dylan rolled his eyes.\\n\\n \"And what do I have to do?\" Jake asked.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll let you know when we\u0027re alone,\" Ivy said.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t get too excited,\" Dylan whispered. \"For some reason, I think it has to do with shopping.\"\\n\\n \"And me?\" Nash asked. \"I\u0027m not going into the woods again. Especially with you. You seem to attract wolves.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll be indoors,\" I said. \"This time, you\u0027ll have to invite someone who isn\u0027t on one of your teams.\"\\n\\n Maybe this was a small gesture for an outsider - to be finally included in the popular students\u0027 party.\\n\\n Nash drove me home. When I unbuckled my seat belt, he leaned over. For some reason, I turned away. His lips landed softly on my cheek.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s wrong?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"Nothing.\" I hopped out of the car before he could question me anymore. As usual, Nash didn\u0027t walk me to the front door but sped off when I unlocked it and stepped inside.\\n\\n Wolves weren\u0027t the only thing on my mind as I tried desperately to fall asleep. I felt attracted to Brandon Maddox like I hadn\u0027t been drawn to anyone ever before - not Nash, or even a movie or TV star I\u0027d adored. I replayed the late afternoon\u0027s harrowing event in my mind - that at the last second before I was about to be wolf bait, a handsome hero swooped into the most dangerous situation of my life and saved me from the clutches of death. I wasn\u0027t sure why I felt so strongly for Brandon - someone who I didn\u0027t really know much about - but I did. Perhaps it was the same feeling a victim has toward a firefighter or police officer who saves them in the line of duty.\\n\\n I recalled the moment when Brandon and I stood together underneath the romantic snowfall and in the solitude of the woods, our bodies close together and our hands entwined. I didn\u0027t want to let go. Not then. Not ever.\\n\\n I was excited. I could barely breathe. I had butterflies fluttering through my body. My heart ached. I wanted to dance around my room for days.\\n\\n I thought about him staring at me when I bandaged his hand and holding me when I felt dizzy. I imagined my scarf, wrapped around his hand; how lucky it was to be so close to him.\\n\\n The more I tried to get Brandon out of my mind, the more he infiltrated it. My soft blue fleece blanket reminded me of his eyes. The winter scarves hanging in my closet only further reminded me of the one I\u0027d secured on his bitten hand. The full moon shining through my bedroom window was the same one that had hovered over us as he fought off the threatening wolves.\\n\\n It didn\u0027t hurt that Brandon was handsome, enigmatic, and strong. I rationalized that I was just swept up in the moment. Maybe in time this emotional connection would dissipate like the snowfall. The clouds would break and I\u0027d be free of this feeling, just as I was finally free from the woods themselves.\\n\\n I wasn\u0027t sure why I was thinking of Brandon when I was currently dating Nash. I was lucky enough to be going out with the star of the basketball team and best friend to my friends\u0027 boyfriends. My parents loved him, and so did everyone at school.\\n\\n Besides, why would Brandon have feelings for me? I was just some girl he heard crying in the woods and decided to help her. I could have been anyone. But when we held hands and he smiled at me, I felt a connection that I\u0027d never experienced before.\\n\\n And at the end of his heroics, he was left wounded and bloody. I couldn\u0027t help but be concerned. His once-healthy hand was mauled and I was the cause. If I hadn\u0027t been so insistent on walking home alone, I wouldn\u0027t have gotten lost and he wouldn\u0027t have been bitten.\\n\\n I tossed and turned and gazed into the moonlight streaming through my curtain and into the darkness of my room. Eventually these crazy love-struck thoughts that possessed me would surely go away and I\u0027d return to daydreaming and writing in my notebook about the moon and the stars.\\n\\n I recalled Nash\u0027s reaction to hearing the cry of a wolf only a few months ago. The two events in the woods mirrored each other. When Nash had told the story of the werewolf, he ran off, frightened by his own tale. Brandon, on the other hand, had risked his life for mine and jumped into a real life-and-death situation without hesitation. Not only didn\u0027t Nash think of me when he was hightailing it back to his car, but he wasn\u0027t thinking of his other friends, either.\\n\\n Did that make Nash a bad person? Maybe I wasn\u0027t being fair to him. No one in their right mind wanted to confront a pack of wolves. I wondered what made someone have the instinct of flight while others had the courage to fight.\\n\\n I\u0027d never be able to admit my doughy, in-love-with-a-Westsider feeling to Ivy or Abby. Brandon didn\u0027t fit neatly into their clique. To them, he was an outsider, plain and simple. He didn\u0027t live in our neighborhood, he didn\u0027t play sports, and, most important, he wasn\u0027t Nash.\\n\\n For now, I\u0027d have to keep my thoughts and feelings locked away inside me. If Brandon didn\u0027t tell anyone about the event, and neither did I, then no one would be the wiser.\\n\\n However, I knew I\u0027d need to thank Brandon. If Nash had rescued someone, he\u0027d want to make it known and be celebrated on national TV. Brandon, however, had disappeared. I didn\u0027t even know where he lived to deliver him a thank-you gift. I assumed he didn\u0027t want any recognition or attention. I felt he might be the kind of person who\u0027d be embarrassed if I tried. Besides, what does one do for a person who saves one\u0027s life? Brandon was a true hero - brave, modest, humble. There was no real way to properly thank them. But that didn\u0027t mean I shouldn\u0027t try.\\n\\n For now, I\u0027d just have to wait for the right moment.\\n\\n I wouldn\u0027t be able to admit my obsessive feelings toward Brandon to anyone - not my friends, family, or him - when it was hard enough to admit them to myself. Instead I looked at the clock and counted the minutes until I knew I\u0027d see him again. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/once-in-a-full-moon-full-moon-1/page-8.html","bookId":2148,"book":{"id":2148,"title":"Once in a Full Moon (Full Moon #1)","description":"Storyline: Once in a Full Moon \\n (Full Moon #1) \\n Celeste Parker is used to hearing scary stories about werewolves—Legend\u0027s Run is famous for them.
