Then, as Teppic grabbed a handful of hair and pulled himself up, the camel started to trot.\n . . . Think fractals . . .\n \u0027Ere, you\u0027re going to run straight-\u0027 the sergeant began.\n There was silence. It went on for a long time.\n The sergeant shifted uneasily. Then he looked across the rocks to the Tsorteans, and caught the eye of their leader. With the unspoken understanding that is shared by centurions and sergeant-majors everywhere, they walked towards one another along the length of the rocks and stopped by the barely visible crack in the cliff.\n The Tsortean sergeant ran his hand over it.\n \u0027You\u0027d think there\u0027d be some, you know, camel hairs or something,\u0027 he said.\n \u0027Or blood,\u0027 said the Ephebian.\n \u0027I reckon it\u0027s one of them unexplainable phenomena.\u0027\n \u0027Oh. That\u0027s all right, then.\u0027\n The two men stared at the stone for a while.\n \u0027Like a mirage,\u0027 said the Tsortean, helpfully.\n \u0027One of them things, yes.\u0027\n \u0027I thought I heard a seagull, too.\u0027\n \u0027Daft, isn\u0027t it. You don\u0027t get them out here.\u0027\n The Tsortean coughed politely, and stared back at his men.\n Then he leaned closer.\n \u0027The rest of your people will be along directly, I expect,\u0027 he said.\n The Ephebian stepped a bit closer and when he spoke, it was out of the corner of his mouth while his eyes apparently remained fully occupied by looking at the rocks.\n \u0027That\u0027s right,\u0027 he said. \u0027And yours too, may I ask?\u0027\n \u0027Yes. I expect we\u0027ll have to massacre you if ours get here first.\u0027\n \u0027Likewise, I shouldn\u0027t wonder. Still, can\u0027t be helped.\u0027\n \u0027One of those things, really,\u0027 agreed the Tsortean. The other man nodded. \u0027Funny old world, when you come to think about it.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027ve put your finger on it, all right.\u0027 The sergeant loosened his breastplate a bit, glad to be out of the sun. \u0027Rations okay on your side?\u0027 he said.\n \u0027Oh, you know. Mustn\u0027t grumble.\u0027\n \u0027Like us, really.\u0027\n \u0027\u0027Cos if you do grumble, they get even worse.\u0027\n \u0027Just like ours. Here, you haven\u0027t got any figs on your side, have you? I could just do with a fig.\u0027\n \u0027Sorry.\u0027\n \u0027Just thought I\u0027d ask.\u0027\n \u0027Got plenty of dates, if they\u0027re any good to you.\u0027\n \u0027We\u0027re okay on dates, thanks.\u0027\n \u0027Sorry.\u0027\n The two men stood awhile, lost in their own thoughts. Then the Ephebian put on his helmet again, and the Tsortean adjusted his belt.\n \u0027Right, then.\u0027\n \u0027Right, then.\u0027\n They squared their shoulders, stuck out their chins, and marched away. A moment later they turned about smartly and, exchanging the merest flicker of an embarrassed grin, headed back to their own sides.\n BOOK IV\n The Book of 101 Things A Boy Can Do\n Teppic had expected-\n -what?\n Possibly the splat of flesh hitting rock. Possibly, although this was on the very edge of expectation, the sight of the Old Kingdom spread out below him.\n He hadn\u0027t expected chilly, damp mists.\n It is now known to science that there are many more dimensions than the classical four. Scientists say that these don\u0027t normally impinge on the world because the extra dimensions are very small and curve in on themselves, and that since reality is fractal most of it is tucked inside itself. This means either that the universe is more full of wonders than we can hope to understand or, more probably, that scientists make things up as they go along.\n But the multiverse is full of little dimensionettes, playstreets of creation where creatures of the imagination can romp without being knocked down by serious actuality. Sometimes, as they drift through the holes in reality, they impinge back on this universe, when they give rise to myths, legends and charges of being Drunk and Disorderly.\n And it was into one of these that You Bastard, by a trivial miscalculation, had trotted.\n Legend had got it nearly right. The Sphinx did lurk on the borders of the kingdom. The legend just hadn\u0027t been precise about what kind of borders it was talking about.\n The Sphinx is an unreal creature. It exists solely because it has been imagined. It is well-known that in an infinite universe everything that can be imagined must exist somewhere, and since many of them are not things that ought to exist in a well-ordered space-time frame they get shoved into a side dimension. This may go some way to explaining the Sphinx\u0027s chronic bad temper, although any creature created with the body of a lion, bosom of a woman and wings of an eagle has a serious identity crisis and doesn\u0027t need much to make it angry.\n So it had devised the Riddle.\n Across various dimensions it had provided the Sphinx with considerable entertainment and innumerable meals.\n This was not known to Teppic as he led You Bastard through the swirling mists, but the bones he crunched underfoot gave him enough essential detail.\n A lot of people had died here. And it was reasonable to assume that the more recent ones had seen the remains of the earlier ones, and would therefore have proceeded stealthily. And that hadn\u0027t worked.\n No sense in creeping along, then. Besides, some of the rocks that loomed out of the mists had a very distressing shape. This one here, for example, looked exactly like-\n \u0027Halt,\u0027 said the Sphinx.\n There was no sound but the drip of the mist and the occasional sucking noise of You Bastard trying to extract moisture from the air.\n \u0027You\u0027re a sphinx,\u0027 said Teppic.\n \u0027The Sphinx,\u0027 corrected the Sphinx.\n \u0027Gosh. We\u0027ve got any amount of statues to you at home.\u0027 Teppic looked up, and then further up. \u0027I thought you\u0027d be smaller,\u0027 he added.\n \u0027Cower, mortal,\u0027 said the Sphinx. \u0027For thou art in the presence of the wise and the terrible.\u0027 It blinked. \u0027Any good, these statues?\u0027\n \u0027They don\u0027t do you justice,\u0027 said Teppic, truthfully.\n \u0027Do you really think so? People often get the nose wrong,\u0027 said the Sphinx. \u0027My right profile is best, I\u0027m told, and-\u0027 It dawned on the Sphinx that it was sidetracking itself. It coughed sternly.\n \u0027Before you can pass me, O mortal,\u0027 it said, \u0027you must answer my riddle.\u0027\n \u0027Why?\u0027 said Teppic.\n \u0027What?\u0027 The Sphinx blinked at him. It hadn\u0027t been designed for this sort of thing.\n \u0027Why? Why? Because. Er. Because, hang on, yes, because I will bite your head off if you don\u0027t. Yes, I think that\u0027s it.\u0027\n \u0027Right,\u0027 said Teppic. \u0027Let\u0027s hear it, then.\u0027\n The Sphinx cleared its throat with a noise like an empty lorry reversing in a quarry.\n \u0027What goes on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening?\u0027 said the Sphinx smugly.\n Teppic considered this.\n \u0027That\u0027s a tough one,\u0027 he said, eventually.\n \u0027The toughest,\u0027 said the Sphinx.\n \u0027Um.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027ll never get it.\u0027\n \u0027Ah,\u0027 said Teppic.\n \u0027Could you take your clothes off while you\u0027re thinking? The threads play merry hell with my teeth.\u0027\n \u0027There isn\u0027t some kind of animal that regrows legs that have been-\u0027\n \u0027Entirely the wrong track,\u0027 said the Sphinx, stretching its claws.\n \u0027Oh.\u0027\n \u0027You haven\u0027t got the faintest idea, have you?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m still thinking,\u0027 said Teppic.\n \u0027You\u0027ll never get it.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re right.\u0027 Teppic stared at the claws. This isn\u0027t really a fighting animal, he told himself reassuringly, it\u0027s definitely over-endowed. Besides, its bosom will get in the way, even if its brain doesn\u0027t.\n \u0027The answer is: “A Man”,\u0027 said the Sphinx. \u0027Now, don\u0027t put up a fight, please, it releases unpleasant chemicals into the bloodstream.\u0027\n Teppic backed away from a slashing paw. \u0027Hold on, hold on,\u0027 he said. \u0027What do you mean, a man?\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s easy,\u0027 said the Sphinx. \u0027A baby crawls in the morning, stands on both legs at noon, and at evening an old man walks with a stick. Good, isn\u0027t it?\u0027\n Teppic bit his lip. \u0027We\u0027re talking about one day here?\u0027 he said doubtfully.\n There was a long, embarrassing silence.\n \u0027It\u0027s a wossname, a figure of speech,\u0027 said the Sphinx irritably, making another lunge.\n \u0027No, no, look, wait a minute,\u0027 said Teppic. \u0027I\u0027d like us to be very clear about this, right? I mean, it\u0027s only fair, right?\u0027\n \u0027Nothing wrong with the riddle,\u0027 said the Sphinx. \u0027Damn good riddle. Had that riddle for fifty years, sphinx and cub.\u0027 It thought about this. \u0027Chick,\u0027 it corrected.\n \u0027It\u0027s a good riddle,\u0027 Teppic said soothingly. \u0027Very deep. Very moving. The whole human condition in a nutshell. But you\u0027ve got to admit, this doesn\u0027t all happen to one individual in one day, does it?\u0027\n \u0027Well. No,\u0027 the Sphinx admitted. \u0027But that is self-evident from the context. An element of dramatic analogy is present in all riddles,\u0027 it added, with the air of one who had heard the phrase a long time ago and rather liked it, although not to the extent of failing to eat the originator.\n \u0027Yes, but,\u0027 said Teppic crouching down and brushing a clear space on the damp sand, \u0027is there internal consistency within the metaphor? Let\u0027s say for example that the average life expectancy is seventy years, okay?\u0027\n \u0027Okay,\u0027 said the Sphinx, in the uncertain tones of someone who has let the salesman in and is now regretfully contemplating a future in which they are undoubtedly going to buy life insurance.\n \u0027Right. Good. So noon would be age 35, am I right? Now considering that most children can toddle at a year or so, the four legs reference is really unsuitable, wouldn\u0027t you agree? I mean, most of the morning is spent on two legs. According to your analogy\u0027 he paused and did a few calculations with a convenient thighbone- \u0027only about twenty minutes immediately after 00.00 hours, half an hour tops, is spent on four legs. Am I right? Be fair.\u0027\n \u0027Well-\u0027 said the Sphinx.\n \u0027By the same token you wouldn\u0027t be using a stick by six p.m. because you\u0027d be only, er, 52,\u0027 said Teppic, scribbling furiously. \u0027In fact you wouldn\u0027t really be looking at any kind of walking aid until at least half past nine, I think. That\u0027s on the assumption that the entire lifespan takes place over one day which is, I believe I have already pointed out, ridiculous. I\u0027m sorry, it\u0027s basically okay, but it doesn\u0027t work.\u0027\n \u0027Well,\u0027 said the Sphinx, but irritably this time, \u0027I don\u0027t see what I can do about it. I haven\u0027t got any more. It\u0027s the only one I\u0027ve ever needed.\u0027\n \u0027You just need to alter it a bit, that\u0027s all.\u0027\n \u0027How do you mean?\u0027\n \u0027Just make it a bit more realistic.\u0027\n \u0027Hmm.\u0027 The Sphinx scratched its mane with a claw.\n \u0027Okay,\u0027 it said doubtfully. \u0027I suppose I could ask: What is it that walks on four legs\u0027\n \u0027Metaphorically speaking,\u0027 said Teppic.\n \u0027Four legs, metaphorically speaking,\u0027 the Sphinx agreed, \u0027for about-\u0027\n \u0027Twenty minutes, I think we agreed.\u0027\n \u0027Okay, fine, twenty minutes in the morning, on two legs\u0027\n \u0027But I think calling it in “the morning” is stretching it a bit,\u0027 said Teppic. \u0027It\u0027s just after midnight. I mean, technically it\u0027s the morning, but in a very real sense it\u0027s still last night, what do you think?\u0027\n A look of glazed panic crossed the Sphinx\u0027s face.\n \u0027What do you think?\u0027 it managed.\n \u0027Let\u0027s just see where we\u0027ve got to, shall we? What, metaphorically speaking, walks on four legs just after midnight, on two legs for most of the day-\u0027\n \u0027Barring accidents,\u0027 said the Sphinx, pathetically eager to show that it was making a contribution.\n \u0027Fine, on two legs barring accidents, until at least suppertime, when it walks with three legs-\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ve known people use two walking sticks,\u0027 said the Sphinx helpfully.\n \u0027Okay. How about: when it continues to walk on two legs or with any prosthetic aids of its choice?\u0027\n The Sphinx gave this some consideration.\n \u0027Ye-ess,\u0027 it said gravely. \u0027That seems to fit all eventualities.\u0027\n \u0027Well?\u0027 said Teppic.\n \u0027Well what?\u0027 said the Sphinx.\n \u0027Well, what\u0027s the answer?\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pyramids-discworld-7/page-34.html","bookId":1626,"book":{"id":1626,"title":"Pyramids (Discworld #7)","description":"Storyline: \n Pyramids (Discworld #7) \n It\u0027s bad enough being new on the job, but Teppic hasn\u0027t a clue as to what a pharaoh is supposed to do.
