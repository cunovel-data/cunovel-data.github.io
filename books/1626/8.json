There was a temporary feeling of heaviness, which suddenly dropped away so that he rose to his feet almost without any effort. He looked down to see what had caused it.\\n\\n \u0027Oh dear,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n The culture of the river kingdom had a lot to say about death and what happened afterwards. In fact it had very little to say about life, regarding it as a sort of inconvenient prelude to the main event and something to be hurried through as politely as possible, and therefore the pharaoh reached the conclusion that he was dead very quickly. The sight of his mangled body on the sand below him played a major part in this.\\n\\n There was a greyness about everything. The landscape had a ghostly look, as though he could walk straight through it. Of course, he thought, I probably can.\\n\\n He rubbed the analogue of his hands. Well, this is it. This is where it gets interesting; this is where I start to really live.\\n\\n Behind him a voice said, GOOD MORNING.\\n\\n The king turned.\\n\\n \u0027Hallo,\u0027 he said. \u0027You\u0027d be-\u0027\\n\\n DEATH, said Death.\\n\\n The king looked surprised.\\n\\n \u0027I understood that Death came as a three-headed giant scarab beetle,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n Death shrugged. WELL. NOW YOU KNOW.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s that thing in your hand?\u0027\\n\\n THIS? IT\u0027S A SCYTHE.\\n\\n \u0027Strange-looking object, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 said the pharaoh. \u0027I thought Death carried the Flail of Mercy and the Reaping Hook of Justice.\u0027\\n\\n Death appeared to think about this.\\n\\n WHAT IN? he said.\\n\\n \u0027Pardon?\u0027\\n\\n ARE WE STILL TALKING ABOUT A GIANT BEETLE?\\n\\n \u0027Ah. In his mandibles, I suppose. But I think he\u0027s got arms in one of the frescoes in the palace.\u0027 The king hesitated. \u0027Seems a bit silly, really, now I come to tell someone. I mean, a giant beetle with arms. And the head of an ibis, I seem to recall.\u0027\\n\\n Death sighed. He was not a creature of Time, and therefore past and future were all one to him, but there had been a period when he\u0027d made an effort to appear in whatever form the client expected. This foundered because it was usually impossible to know what the client was expecting until after they were dead. And then he\u0027d decided that, since no-one ever really expected to die anyway, he might as well please himself and he\u0027d henceforth stuck to the familiar black-cowled robe, which was neat and very familiar and acceptable everywhere, like the best credit cards.\\n\\n \u0027Anyway,\u0027 said the pharaoh, \u0027I expect we\u0027d better be going.\u0027\\n\\n WHERE TO?\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t you know?\u0027\\n\\n I AM HERE ONLY TO SEE THAT YOU DIE AT THE APPOINTED TIME. WHAT HAPPENS NEXT IS UP TO YOU.\\n\\n \u0027Well . . .\u0027 The king automatically scratched his chin. \u0027I suppose I have to wait until they\u0027ve done all the preparations and so forth. Mummified me. And built a bloody pyramid. Um. Do I have to hang around here to wait for all that?\u0027\\n\\n I ASSUME SO. Death clicked his fingers and a magnificent white horse ceased its grazing on some of the garden greenery and trotted towards him.\\n\\n \u0027Oh. Well, I think I shall look away. They take all the squishy inside bits out first, you know.\u0027 A look of faint worry crossed his face. Things that had seemed perfectly sensible when he was alive seemed a little suspect now that he was dead.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s to preserve the body so that it may begin life anew in the Netherworld,\u0027 he added, in a slightly perplexed voice. \u0027And then they wrap you in bandages. At least that seems logical.\u0027\\n\\n He rubbed his nose. \u0027But then they put all this food and drink in the pyramid with you. Bit weird, really.\u0027\\n\\n WHERE ARE ONE\u0027S INTERNAL ORGANS AT THIS POINT?\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s the funny thing, isn\u0027t it? They\u0027re in a jar in the next room,\u0027 said the king, his voice edged with doubt. \u0027We even put a damn great model cart in dad\u0027s pyramid.\u0027\\n\\n His frown deepened. \u0027Solid wood, it was,\u0027 he said, half to himself, \u0027with gold leaf all over it. And four wooden bullocks to pull it. Then we whacked a damn great stone over the door . . .\u0027\\n\\n He tried to think, and found that it was surprisingly easy. New ideas were pouring into his mind in a cold, clear stream. They had to do with the play of light on the rocks, the deep blue of the sky, the manifold possibilities of the world that stretched away on every side of him. Now that he didn\u0027t have a body to importune him with its insistent demands the world seemed full of astonishments, but unfortunately among the first of them was the fact that much of what you thought was true now seemed as solid and reliable as marsh gas. And also that, just as he was fully equipped to enjoy the world, he was going to be buried inside a pyramid.\\n\\n When you die, the first thing you lose is your life. The next thing is your illusions.\\n\\n I CAN SEE YOU HAVE GOT A LOT TO THINK ABOUT, said Death, mounting up. AND NOW, IF YOU\u0027LL EXCUSE ME-\\n\\n \u0027Hang on a moment-\u0027\\n\\n YES?\\n\\n \u0027When I . . . fell, I could have sworn that I was flying.\u0027\\n\\n THAT PART OF YOU THAT WAS DIVINE DID FLY, NATURALLY. YOU ARE NOW FULLY MORTAL.\\n\\n \u0027Mortal?\u0027\\n\\n TAKE IT FROM ME. I KNOW ABOUT THESE THINGS.\\n\\n \u0027Oh. Look, there\u0027s quite a few questions I\u0027d like to ask-\u0027\\n\\n THERE ALWAYS ARE. I\u0027M SORRY. Death clapped his heels to his horse\u0027s flanks, and vanished.\\n\\n The king stood there as several servants came hurrying along the palace wall, slowed down as they approached his corpse, and advanced with caution.\\n\\n \u0027Are you all right, O jewelled master of the sun?\u0027 one of them ventured.\\n\\n \u0027No, I\u0027m not,\u0027 snapped the king, who was having some of his basic assumptions about the universe severely raffled, and that never puts anyone in a good mood. \u0027I\u0027m by way of being dead just at the moment. Amazing, isn\u0027t it,\u0027 he added bitterly.\\n\\n \u0027Can you hear us, O divine bringer of the morning?\u0027 inquired the other servant, tiptoeing closer.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve just fallen off a hundred foot wall on to my head, what do you think?\u0027 shouted the king.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t think he can hear us, Jahmet,\u0027 said the other servant.\\n\\n \u0027Listen,\u0027 said the king, whose urgency was equalled only by the servants\u0027 total inability to hear anything he was saying, \u0027you must find my son and tell him to forget about the pyramid business, at least until I\u0027ve thought about it a bit, there are one or two points which seem a little self-contradictory about the whole afterlife arrangements, and-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Shall I shout?\u0027 said Jahmet.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t think you can shout loud enough. I think he\u0027s dead.\u0027\\n\\n Jahmet looked down at the stiffening corpse.\\n\\n \u0027Bloody hell,\u0027 he said eventually. \u0027Well, that\u0027s tomorrow up the spout for a start.\u0027\\n\\n The sun, unaware that it was making its farewell performance, continued to drift smoothly above the rim of the world. And out of it, moving faster than any bird should be able to fly, a seagull bore down on Ankh-Morpork, on the Brass Bridge and eight still figures, on one staring face .\\n\\n Seagulls were common enough in Ankh. But as this one flew over the group it uttered one long, guttural scream that caused three of the thieves to drop their knives. Nothing with feathers ought to have been able to make a noise like that. It had claws in it.\\n\\n The bird wheeled in a tight circle and fluttered to a perch on a convenient wooden hippo, where it glared at the group with mad red eyes.\\n\\n The leading thief tore his fascinated gaze away from it just as he heard Arthur say, quite pleasantly, \u0027This is a number two throwing knife. I got ninety-six per cent for throwing knives. Which eyeball don\u0027t you need?\u0027\\n\\n The leader stared at him. As far as the other young assassins were concerned, he noticed, one was still staring fixedly at the seagull while the other was busy being noisily sick over the parapet.\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s only one of you,\u0027 he said. \u0027There\u0027s five of us.\\n\\n \u0027But soon there will only be four of you,\u0027 said Arthur. Moving slowly, like someone in a daze, Teppic reached out his hand to the seagull. With any normal seagull this would have resulted in the loss of a thumb, but the creature hopped on to it with the smug air of the master returning to the old plantation.\\n\\n It seemed to make the thieves increasingly uneasy. Arthur\u0027s smile wasn\u0027t helping either.\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s a nice bird,\u0027 said the leader, in the inanely cheerful tones of the extremely worried. Teppic was dreamily stroking its bullet head.\\n\\n \u0027I think it would be a good idea if you went away,\u0027 said Arthur, as the bird shuffled sideways on to Teppic\u0027s wrist. Gripping with webbed feet, thrusting out its wings to maintain its balance, it should have looked clownish but instead looked full of hidden power, as though it was an eagle\u0027s secret identity. When it opened its mouth, revealing a ridiculous purple bird tongue, there was a suggestion that this seagull could do a lot more than menace a seaside tomato sandwich.\\n\\n \u0027Is it magic?\u0027 said one of the thieves, and was quickly hushed.\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027ll be going, then,\u0027 said the leader, \u0027sorry about the misunderstanding-\u0027\\n\\n Teppic gave him a warm, unseeing smile.\\n\\n Then they all heard the insistent little noise. Six pairs of eyes swivelled around and down; Chidder\u0027s were already in position.\\n\\n Below them, pouring darkly across the dehydrated mud, the Ankh was rising.\\n\\n Dios, First Minister and high priest among high priests, wasn\u0027t a naturally religious man. It wasn\u0027t a desirable quality in a high priest, it affected your judgement, made you unsound. Start believing in things and the whole business became a farce.\\n\\n Not that he had anything against belief. People needed to believe in gods, if only because it was so hard to believe in people. The gods were necessary. He just required that they stayed out of the way and let him get on with things.\\n\\n Mind you, it was a blessing that he had the looks for it. If your genes saw fit to give you a tall frame, a bald head and a nose you could plough rocks with, they probably had a definite aim in mind.\\n\\n He instinctively distrusted people to whom religion came easily. The naturally religious, he felt, were unstable and given to wandering in the desert and having revelations - as if the gods would lower themselves to that sort of thing. And they never got anything done. They started thinking that rituals weren\u0027t important. They started thinking that you could talk to the gods direct. Dios knew, with the kind of rigid and unbending certainty you could pivot the world on, that the gods of Djelibeybi liked ritual as much as anyone else. After all, a god who was against ritual would be like a fish who was against water.\\n\\n He sat on the steps of the throne with his staff across his knees, and passed on the king\u0027s orders. The fact that they were not currently being issued by any king was not a problem. Dios had been high priest now for, well, more years than he cared to remember, he knew quite clearly what orders a sensible king would be giving, and he gave them.\\n\\n Anyway, the Face of the Sun was on the throne, and that was what mattered. It was a solid gold, head-enveloping mask, to be worn by the current ruler on all public occasions; its expression, to the sacrilegious, was one of good-natured constipation. For thousands of years it had symbolised kingship in Djelibeybi. It had also made it very difficult to tell kings apart.\\n\\n This was extremely symbolic as well, although no-one could remember what of.\\n\\n There was a lot of that sort of thing in the Old Kingdom. The staff across his knees, for example, with its very symbolic snakes entwined symbolically around an allegorical camel prod. The people believed this gave the high priests power over the gods and the dead, but this was probably a metaphor, i.e., a lie.\\n\\n Dios shifted position.\\n\\n \u0027Has the king been ushered to the Room of Going Forth?\u0027 he said.\\n\\n The circle of lesser high priests nodded.\\n\\n \u0027Dil the embalmer is attending upon him at this instant, O Dios.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Very well. And the builder of pyramids has been instructed?\u0027 Hoot Koomi, high priest of Khefin, the Two-Faced God of Gateways, stepped forward. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pyramids-discworld-7/page-8.html","bookId":1626,"book":{"id":1626,"title":"Pyramids (Discworld #7)","description":"Storyline: Pyramids (Discworld #7) \\n It\u0027s bad enough being new on the job, but Teppic hasn\u0027t a clue as to what a pharaoh is supposed to do.
