{"id":95671,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"There hadn\u0027t been any doubt about Arthur passing. He\u0027d been given extra tuition and was allowed to use really complicated poisons. He was probably going to stay on for post-graduate work.\n They waited until the gongs of the city struck two. Clock work was not a precise technology in Ankh-Morpork, and many of the city\u0027s variuos communities had their own ideas of what constituted an hour in any case, so the chimes went on bouncing around the rooftops for five minutes.\n When it was obvious that the city\u0027s consensus was in favour of it being well past two the three of them stopped looking silently at their shoes.\n \u0027Well, that\u0027s it,\u0027 said Chidder.\n \u0027Poor old Cheesewright,\u0027 said Arthur. \u0027It\u0027s tragic, when you think about it.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, he owed me fourpence,\u0027 agreed Chidder. \u0027Come on. I\u0027ve arranged something for us.\u0027\n King Teppicymon XXVII got out of bed and clapped his hands over his ears to shut out the roar of the sea. It was strong tonight.\n It was always louder when he was feeling out of sorts. He needed something to distract himself. He could send for Ptraci, his favourite handmaiden. She was special. Her singing always cheered him up. Life seemed so much brighter when she stopped.\n Or there was the sunrise. That was always comforting. It was pleasant to sit wrapped in a blanket on the topmost roof of the palace, watching the mists lift from the river as the golden flood poured over the land. You got that warm, contented feeling of another job well done. Even if you didn\u0027t actually know how you\u0027d done it . . .\n He got up, shuffled on his slippers, and padded out of his bedroom and down the wide corridor that led to the huge spiral stairs and the roof. A few rushlights illuminated the statues of the other local gods, painting the walls with shifting shadow pictures of things dog-headed, fish-bodied, spider-armed. He\u0027d known them since childhood. His juvenile nightmares would have been quite formless without them.\n The sea. He\u0027d only seen it once, when he was a boy. He couldn\u0027t recall a lot about it, except the size. And the noise. And the seagulls.\n They\u0027d preyed on his mind. They seemed to have it far better worked out, seagulls. He wished he could come back as one, one day, but of course that wasn\u0027t an option if you were a pharaoh. You never came back. You didn\u0027t exactly go away, in fact.\n \u0027Well, what is it?\u0027 said Teppic.\n \u0027Try it,\u0027 said Chidder, \u0027just try it. You\u0027ll never have the chance again.\u0027\n \u0027Seems a shame to spoil it,\u0027 said Arthur gallantly looking down at the delicate pattern on his plate. \u0027What are all the little red things?\u0027\n \u0027They\u0027re just radishes,\u0027 said Chidder dismissively. \u0027They\u0027re not the important part. Go on.\u0027\n Teppic reached over with the little wooden fork and skewered a paper-thin sliver of white fish. The squishi chef was scrutinising him with the air of one watching a toddler on his first birthday. So, he realised, was the rest of the restaurant.\n He chewed it carefully. It was salty and faintly rubbery, with a hint of sewage outfall.\n \u0027Nice?\u0027 said Chidder anxiously. Several nearby diners started to clap.\n \u0027Different,\u0027 Teppic conceded, chewing. \u0027What is it?\u0027\n \u0027Deep sea blowfish,\u0027 said Chidder.\n \u0027It\u0027s all right,\u0027 he said hastily as Teppic laid down his fork meaningfully, \u0027it\u0027s perfectly safe provided every bit of stomach, liver and digestive tract is removed, that\u0027s why it cost so much, there\u0027s no such thing as a second-best blowfish chef, it\u0027s the most expensive food in the world, people write poems about it-\u0027\n \u0027Could be a taste explosion,\u0027 muttered Teppic, getting a grip on himself. Still, it must have been done properly, otherwise the place would now be wearing him as wallpaper. He poked carefully at the sliced roots which occupied the rest of the plate.\n \u0027What do these do to you?\u0027 he said.\n \u0027Well, unless they\u0027re prepared in exactly the right way over a six-week period they react catastrophically with your stomach acids,\u0027 said Chidder. \u0027Sorry. I thought we should celebrate with the most expensive meal we could afford.\u0027\n \u0027I see. Fish and chips for Men,\u0027 said Teppic.\n \u0027Do they have any vinegar in this place?\u0027 said Arthur, his mouth full. \u0027And some mushy peas would go down a treat.\u0027\n But the wine was good. Not incredibly good, though. Not one of the great vintages. But it did explain why Teppic had gone through the whole of the day with a headache.\n It had been the hangunder. His friend had bought four bottles of otherwise quite ordinary white wine. The reason it was so expensive was that the grapes it was made from hadn\u0027t actually been planted yet.[8]\n Light moves slowly, lazily on the Disc. It\u0027s in no hurry to get anywhere. Why bother? At lightspeed, everywhere is the same place.\n King Teppicymon XXVII watched the golden disc float over the edge of the world. A flight of cranes took off from the mist-covered river.\n He\u0027d been conscientious, he told himself. No-one had ever explained to him how one made the sun come up and the river flood and the corn grow. How could they? He was the god, after all. He should know. But he didn\u0027t, so he\u0027d just gone through life hoping like hell that it would all work properly, and that seemed to have done the trick. The trouble was, though, that if it didn\u0027t work, he wouldn\u0027t know why not. A recurrent nightmare was of Dios the high priest shaking him awake one morning, only it wouldn\u0027t be a morning, of course, and of every light in the palace burning and an angry crowd muttering in the star-lit darkness outside and everyone looking expectantly at him..\n And all he\u0027d be able to say was, \u0027Sorry\u0027.\n It terrified him. How easy to imagine the ice forming on the river, the eternal frost riming the palm trees and snapping off the leaves (which would smash when they hit the frozen ground) and the birds dropping lifeless from the sky\n Shadow swept over him. He looked up through eyes misted with tears at a grey and empty horizon, his mouth dropping open in horror.\n He stood up, flinging aside the blanket, and raised both hands in supplication. But the sun had gone. He was the god, this was his job, it was the only thing he was here to do, and he had failed the people.\n Now he could hear in his mind\u0027s ear the anger of the crowd, a booming roar that began to fill his ears until the rhythm became insistent and familiar, until it reached the point where it pressed in no longer but drew him out, into that salty blue desert where the sun always shone and sleek shapes wheeled across the sky.\n The pharaoh raised himself on his toes, threw back his head, spread his wings. And leapt.\n As he soared into the sky he was surprised to hear a thump behind him. And the sun came out from behind the clouds.\n Later on, the pharaoh felt awfully embarrassed about it.\n The three new assassins staggered slowly along the street, constantly on the point of falling over but never quite reaching it, trying to sing \u0027A Wizard\u0027s Staff Has A Knob On The End\u0027 in harmony or at least in the same key.\n \u0027Tis big an\u0027 i\u0027ss round an\u0027 weighs three to the-\u0027 sang Chidder. \u0027Blast, what\u0027ve I stepped in?\u0027\n \u0027Anyone know where we are?\u0027 said Arthur.\n \u0027We - we were headed for the Guildhouse,\u0027 said Teppic, \u0027only must of took the wrong way, that\u0027s the river up ahead. Can smell it.\u0027\n Caution penetrated Arthur\u0027s armour of alcohol.\n \u0027Could be dangerous pep - plep - people around, this time o\u0027 night,\u0027 he hazarded.\n \u0027Yep,\u0027 said Chidder, with satisfaction, \u0027us. Got ticket to prove it. Got test and everything. Like to see anyone try anything with us.\u0027\n \u0027Right,\u0027 agreed Teppic, leaning against him for support of a sort. \u0027We\u0027ll slit them from wossname to thingy.\u0027\n \u0027Right!\u0027\n They lurched uncertainly out on to the Brass Bridge.\n In fact there were dangerous people around in the pre-dawn shadows, and currently these were some twenty paces behind them.\n The complex system of criminal Guilds had not actually made Ankh-Morpork a safer place, it just rationalised its dangers and put them on a regular and reliable footing. The major Guilds policed the city with more thoroughness and certainly more success than the old Watch had ever managed, and it was true that any freelance and unlicensed thief caught by the Thieves\u0027 Guild would soon find himself remanded in custody by social inquiry reports plus having his knees nailed together[9].\n However, there were always a few spirits who would venture a precarious living outside the lawless, and the five men of this description were closing cautiously on the trio to introduce them to this week\u0027s special offer, a cut throat plus theft and burial in the river mud of your choice.\n People normally keep out of the way of assassins because of an instinctive feeling that killing people for very large sums of money is disapproved of by the gods (who generally prefer people to be killed for very small sums of money or for free) and could result in hubris, which is the judgement of the gods. The gods are great believers in justice, at least as far as it extends to humans, and have been known to dispense it so enthusiastically that people miles away are turned into cruet.\n However, assassin\u0027s black doesn\u0027t frighten everyone, and in certain sections of society there is a distinct cachet in killing an assassin. It\u0027s rather like smashing a sixer in conkers.\n Broadly, therefore, the three even now lurching across the deserted planks of the Brass Bridge were dead drunk assassins and the men behind them were bent on inserting the significant comma.\n Chidder wandered into one of the heraldic wooden hippopotami[10] that lined the seaward edge of the bridge, bounced off and flopped over the parapet.\n \u0027Feel sick,\u0027 he announced.\n \u0027Feel free,\u0027 said Arthur, \u0027that\u0027s what the river\u0027s for.\u0027\n Teppic sighed. He was attached to rivers, which he felt were designed to have water lilies on top and crocodiles underneath, and the Ankh always depressed him because if you put a water lily in it, it would dissolve. It drained the huge silty plains all the way to the Ramtop mountains, and by the time it had passed through Ankh-Morpork, pop. One million, it could only be called a liquid because it moved faster than the land around it; actually being sick in it would probably make it, on average, marginally cleaner.\n He stared down at the thin trickle that oozed between the central pillars, and then raised his gaze to the grey horizon.\n \u0027Sun\u0027s coming up,\u0027 he announced.\n \u0027Don\u0027t remember eating that,\u0027 muttered Chidder.\n Teppic stepped back, and a knife ripped past his nose and buried itself in the buttocks of the hippo next to him.\n Five figures stepped out of the mists. The three assassins instinctively drew together.\n \u0027You come near me, you\u0027ll really regret it,\u0027 moaned Chidder, clutching his stomach. \u0027The cleaning bill will be horrible.\u0027\n \u0027Well now, what have we here?\u0027 said the leading thief. This is the sort of thing that gets said in these circumstances.\n \u0027Thieves\u0027 Guild, are you?\u0027 said Arthur.\n \u0027No,\u0027 said the leader, \u0027we\u0027re the small and unrepresentative minority that gets the rest a bad name. Give us your valuables and weapons, please. This won\u0027t make any difference to the outcome, you understand. It\u0027s just that corpse robbing is unpleasant and degrading.\u0027\n \u0027We could rush them,\u0027 said Teppic, uncertainly.\n \u0027Don\u0027t look at me,\u0027 said Arthur, \u0027I couldn\u0027t find my arse with an atlas.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027ll really be sorry when I\u0027m sick,\u0027 said Chidder. Teppic was aware of the throwing knives stuffed up either sleeve, and that the chances of him being able to get hold of one in time still to be alive to throw it were likely to be very small.\n At times like this religious solace is very important. He turned and looked towards the sun, just as it withdrew from the cloudbanks of the dawn.\n There was a tiny dot in the centre of it.\n The late King Teppicymon XXVII opened his eyes. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pyramids-discworld-7/page-7.html","bookId":1626,"book":{"id":1626,"title":"Pyramids (Discworld #7)","description":"Storyline: \n Pyramids (Discworld #7) \n It\u0027s bad enough being new on the job, but Teppic hasn\u0027t a clue as to what a pharaoh is supposed to do.
