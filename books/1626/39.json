The nearest god, a crocodile-headed thing, jerked on to the plaza before the pyramid, squinted up at Teppic, and reached out towards him. Teppic fumbled for a knife, wondering what sort was appropriate for gods .\\n\\n And, along the Djel, the pyramids began to flare their meagre store of hoarded time.\\n\\n Priests and ancestors fled as the ground began to shake. Even the gods looked bewildered.\\n\\n IIb snatched his father\u0027s arm and dragged him away.\\n\\n \u0027Come on!\u0027 he yelled into his ear. \u0027We can\u0027t be around here when it goes off! Otherwise you\u0027ll be put to bed on a coathanger!\u0027\\n\\n Around them several other pyramids struck their flares, thin and reedy affairs that were barely visible in the afterglow.\\n\\n \u0027Dad! I said we\u0027ve got to go!\u0027\\n\\n Ptaclusp was dragged backwards across the flagstones, still staring at the hulking outline of the Great Pyramid.\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s someone still there, look,\u0027 he said, and pointed to a figure alone on the plaza.\\n\\n IIb peered into the gloom.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s only Dios, the high priest,\u0027 he said. \u0027I expect he\u0027s got some plan in mind, best not to meddle in the affairs of priests, now will you come on.\u0027\\n\\n The crocodile-headed god turned its snout back and forth, trying to focus on Teppic without the advantage of binocular vision. This close, its body was slightly transparent, as though someone had sketched in all the lines and got bored before it was time to do the shading. It trod on a small tomb, crushing it to powder.\\n\\n A hand like a cluster of canoes with claws on hovered over Teppic. The pyramid trembled and the stone under his feet felt warm, but it resolutely forbore from any signs of wanting to flare.\\n\\n The hand descended. Teppic sank on one knee and, out of desperation, raised the knife over his head in both hands.\\n\\n The light glinted for a moment off the tip of the blade and then the Great Pyramid flared.\\n\\n It did it in absolute silence to begin with, sending up a spire of eye-torturing flame that turned the whole kingdom into a criss-cross of black shadow and white light, a flame that might have turned any watchers not just into a pillar of salt but into a complete condiment set of their choice. It exploded like an unwound dandelion, silent as starlight, searing as a supernova.\\n\\n Only after it had been bathing the necropolis in its impossible brilliance for several seconds did the sound come, and it was sound that winds itself up through the bones, creeps into every cell of the body, and tries with some success to turn them inside out. It was too loud to be called noise. There is sound so loud that it prevents itself from being heard, and this was that kind of sound.\\n\\n Eventually it condescended to drop out of the cosmic scale and became, simply, the loudest noise anyone hearing it had ever experienced.\\n\\n The noise stopped, filling the air with the dark metallic clang of sudden silence. The light went out, lancing the night with blue and purple afterimages. It was not the silence and darkness of conclusion but of pause, like the moment of equilibrium when a thrown ball runs out of acceleration but has yet to have gravity drawn to its attention and, for a brief moment, thinks that the worst is over.\\n\\n This time it was heralded by a shrill whistling out of the clear sky and a swirl in the air that became a glow, became a flame, became a flare that sizzled downwards into the pyramid, punching into the mass of black marble. Fingers of lightning crackled out and grounded on the lesser tombs around it, so that serpents of white fire burned their way from pyramid to pyramid across the necropolis and the air filled with the stink of burning stone.\\n\\n In the middle of the firestorm the Great Pyramid appeared to lift up a few inches, on a beam of incandescence, and turn through ninety degrees. This was almost certainly the special type of optical illusion which can take place even though noone is actually looking at it.\\n\\n And then, with deceptive slowness and considerable dignity, it exploded.\\n\\n It was almost too crass a word. What it did was this: it came apart ponderously into building-sized chunks which drifted gently away from one another, flying serenely out and over the necropolis. Several of them struck other pyramids, badly damaging them in a lazy, unselfconscious way, and then bounded on in silence until they ploughed to a halt behind a small mountain of rubble.\\n\\n Only then did the boom come. It went on for quite along time.\\n\\n Grey dust rolled over the kingdom.\\n\\n Ptaclusp dragged himself upright and groped ahead, gingerly, until he walked into someone. He shuddered when he thought about the kind of people he\u0027d seen walking around lately, but thought didn\u0027t come easily because something appeared to have hit him on the head recently .\\n\\n \u0027Is that you, lad?\u0027 he ventured.\\n\\n \u0027Is that you, dad?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Ptaclusp.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s me, dad.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m glad it\u0027s you, son.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Can you see anything?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No. It\u0027s all mist and fog.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Thank the gods for that, I thought it was me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It is you, isn\u0027t it? You said.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, dad.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Is your brother all right?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve got him safe in my pocket, dad.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Good. So long as nothing\u0027s happened to him.\u0027\\n\\n They inched forward, clambering over lumps of masonry they could barely see.\\n\\n \u0027Something exploded, dad,\u0027 said IIb, slowly. \u0027I think it was the pyramid.\u0027\\n\\n Ptaclusp rubbed the top of his head, where two tons of flying rock had come within a sixteenth of an inch of fitting him for one of his own pyramids. \u0027It was that dodgy cement we bought from Merco the Ephebian, I expect-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I think this was a bit worse than a moody lintel, dad,\u0027 said IIb. \u0027In fact, I think it was a lot worse.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It looked a bit wossname, a bit on the sandy side-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I think you should find somewhere to sit down, dad,\u0027 said IIb, as kindly as possible. \u0027Here\u0027s Two-Ay. Hang on to him.\u0027\\n\\n He crept on alone, climbing over a slab of what felt very suspiciously like black marble. What he wanted, he decided, was a priest. They had to be useful for something, and this seemed the sort of time one might need one. For solace, or possibly, he felt obscurely, to beat their head in with a rock.\\n\\n What he found instead was someone on their hands and knees, coughing. IIb helped him - it was definitely a him, he\u0027d been briefly afraid it might be an it - and sat him on another lump of, yes, almost certainly marble.\\n\\n \u0027Are you a priest?\u0027 he said, fumbling in the rubble.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m Dil. Chief embalmer,\u0027 the figure muttered.\\n\\n \u0027Ptaclusp IIb, paracosmic archi-\u0027 IIb began and then, suspecting that architects were not going to be too popular around here for a while, quickly corrected himself. \u0027I\u0027m an engineer,\u0027 he said. \u0027Are you all right?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t know. What happened?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I think the pyramid exploded,\u0027 IIb volunteered.\\n\\n \u0027Are we dead?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I shouldn\u0027t think so. You\u0027re walking and talking, after all.\u0027\\n\\n Dil shivered. \u0027That\u0027s no guideline, take it from me. What\u0027s an engineer?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, a builder of aqueducts,\u0027 said IIb quickly. \u0027They\u0027re the coming thing, you know.\u0027\\n\\n Dil stood up, a little shakily.\\n\\n \u0027I,\u0027 he said, \u0027need a drink. Let\u0027s find the river.\u0027\\n\\n They found Teppic first.\\n\\n He was clinging to a small, truncated pyramid section that had made a moderate-sized crater when it landed.\\n\\n \u0027I know him,\u0027 said IIb. \u0027He\u0027s the lad who was on top of the pyramid. That\u0027s ridiculous, how could he survive that?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why\u0027s there all corn sprouting out of it, too?\u0027 wondered Dil.\\n\\n \u0027I mean, perhaps there\u0027s some kind of effect if you\u0027re right in the centre of the flare, or something,\u0027 said IIb, thinking aloud. \u0027A sort of calm area or something, like in the middle of a whirlpool-\u0027 He reached instinctively for his wax tablet, and then stopped himself. Man was never intended to understand things he meddled with. \u0027Is he dead?\u0027 he said. \u0027Don\u0027t look at me,\u0027 said Dil, stepping back. He\u0027d been running through his mind the alternative occupations now open to him. Upholstery sounded attractive. At least chairs didn\u0027t get up and walk after you\u0027d stuffed them. IIb bent over the body.\\n\\n \u0027Look what he\u0027s got in his hand,\u0027 he said, gently bending back the fingers. \u0027It\u0027s a piece of melted metal. What\u0027s he got that for?\u0027\\n\\n Teppic dreamed.\\n\\n He saw seven fat cows and seven thin cows, and one of them was riding a bicycle.\\n\\n He saw some camels, singing, and the song straightened out the wrinkles in reality.\\n\\n He saw a finger Write on the wall of a pyramid: Going forth is easy. Going back requires (cont. on next wall) . . .\\n\\n He walked around the pyramid, where the finger continued: An effort of will, because it is much harder. Thank you.\\n\\n Teppic considered this, and it occurred to him that there was one thing left to do which he had not done. He\u0027d never known how to before, but now he could see that it was just numbers, arranged in a special way. Everything that was magical was just a way of describing the world in words it couldn\u0027t ignore.\\n\\n He gave a grunt of effort.\\n\\n There was a brief moment of speed. Dil and IIb looked around as long shafts of light sparkled through the mists and dust, turning the landscape into old gold.\\n\\n And the sun came up.\\n\\n The sergeant cautiously opened the hatch in the horse\u0027s belly. When the expected flurry of spears did not materialise he ordered Autocue to let out the rope ladder, climbed down it, and looked across the chill morning desert.\\n\\n The new recruit followed him down and stood, hopping from one sandal to another, on sand that was nearly freezing now and would be frying by lunchtime.\\n\\n \u0027There,\u0027 said the sergeant, pointing, \u0027see the Tsortean lines, lad?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Looks like a row of wooden horses to me, sergeant,\u0027 said Autocue. \u0027The one on the end\u0027s on rockers.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027ll be the officers. Huh. Those Tsorteans must think we\u0027re simple.\u0027 The sergeant stamped some life into his legs, took a few breaths of fresh air, and walked back to the ladder.\\n\\n \u0027Come on, lad,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027Why\u0027ve we got to go back up there?\u0027\\n\\n The sergeant paused, his foot on a rope rung.\\n\\n \u0027Use some common, laddie. They\u0027re not going to come and take our horses if they see us hanging around outside, are they? Stands to reason.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You sure they\u0027re going to come, then?\u0027 said Autocue. The sergeant frowned at him.\\n\\n \u0027Look, soldier,\u0027 he said, \u0027anyone bloody stupid enough to think we\u0027re going to drag a lot of horses full of soldiers back to our city is certainly daft enough to drag ours all the way back to theirs. QED.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027QED, sarge?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It means get back up the bloody ladder, lad.\u0027\\n\\n Autocue saluted. \u0027Permission to be excused first, sarge?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Excused what?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Excused, sarge,\u0027 said Autocue, a shade desperately. \u0027I mean, it\u0027s a bit cramped in the horse, sarge, if you know what I mean.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re going to have to learn a bit of will power if you want to stay in the horse soldiers, boy. You know that?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, sarge,\u0027 said Autocue miserably.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ve got one minute.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Thanks, sarge.\u0027\\n\\n When the hatch closed above him Autocue sidled over to one of the horse\u0027s massive legs and put it to a use for which it wasn\u0027t originally intended.\\n\\n And it was while he was staring vaguely ahead, lost in that Zen-like contemplation which occurs at moments like this, that there was a faint pop in the air and an entire river valley opened up in front of him.\\n\\n It\u0027s not the sort of thing that ought to happen to a thoughtful lad. Especially one who has to wash his own uniform. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pyramids-discworld-7/page-39.html","bookId":1626,"book":{"id":1626,"title":"Pyramids (Discworld #7)","description":"Storyline: Pyramids (Discworld #7) \\n It\u0027s bad enough being new on the job, but Teppic hasn\u0027t a clue as to what a pharaoh is supposed to do.
