{"id":95692,"no":28,"title":"Page 28","content":"\u0027I think it got caught up in geometry,\u0027 he said, hopefully. \u0027I heard you were very good at geometry here,\u0027 he added, \u0027and perhaps you could tell me how to get back.\u0027 \u0027Geometry is not my forte,\u0027 said Ibid. \u0027As you probably know.\u0027 \u0027Sorry?\u0027 \u0027Haven\u0027t you read my Principles of Ideal Government?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m afraid not.\u0027 \u0027Or my Discourse on Historical Inevitability?\u0027 \u0027No.\u0027 Ibid looked crestfallen. \u0027Oh,\u0027 he said. \u0027Ibid is a well-known authority on everything,\u0027 said Xeno. \u0027Except for geometry. And interior decorating. And elementary logic.\u0027 Ibid glared at him. \u0027What about you, then?\u0027 said Teppic. Xeno drained his mug. \u0027I\u0027m more into the destruct testing of axioms,\u0027 he said. \u0027The chap you need is Pthagonal. A very acute man with an angle.\u0027 He was interrupted by the clatter of hooves. Several horsemen galloped with reckless speed past the tavern and on up the winding, cobbled streets of the city. They seemed very excited about something. Ibid picked a stunned seagull out of his wine cup and laid it on the table. He was looking thoughtful. \u0027If the Old Kingdom has really disappeared-\u0027 he said. \u0027It has,\u0027 said Teppic firmly. \u0027It\u0027s not something you can be mistaken about, really.\u0027 \u0027Then that means our border is concurrent with that of Tsort,\u0027 said Ibid ponderously. \u0027Pardon?\u0027 said Teppic. \u0027There\u0027s nothing between us,\u0027 explained the philosopher. \u0027Oh, dear. That means we shall be forced to make war.\u0027 \u0027Why?\u0027 Ibid opened his mouth, stopped, and turned to Xeno. \u0027Why does it mean we\u0027ll be forced to make war?\u0027 he said. \u0027Historical imperative,\u0027 said Xeno. \u0027Ah, yes. I knew it was something like that. I am afraid it is inevitable. It\u0027s a shame, but there you are.\u0027 There was another clatter as another party of horsemen rounded the corner, heading downhill this time. They wore the high plumed helmets of Ephebian soldiery, and were shouting enthusiastically. Ibid settled himself more comfortably on the bench and folded his bands. \u0027That\u0027ll be the Tyrant\u0027s men,\u0027 he said, as the troop galloped through the city gates and out on to the desert. \u0027He\u0027s sending them to check, you may depend upon it.\u0027 Teppic knew about the enmity between Ephebe and Tsort, of course. The Old Kingdom had profited mightily by it, by seeing that the merchants of both sides had somewhere discreet in which to trade with one another. He drummed his fingers on the table. \u0027You haven\u0027t fought each other for thousands of years,\u0027 he said. \u0027You were tiny countries in those days. It was just a scrap. Now you\u0027re huge. People could get hurt. Doesn\u0027t that worry you?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s a matter of pride,\u0027 said Ibid, but his voice was tinged with uncertainty. \u0027I don\u0027t think there\u0027s much choice.\u0027 \u0027It was that bloody wooden cow or whatever,\u0027 said Xeno. \u0027They\u0027ve never forgiven us for it.\u0027 \u0027If we don\u0027t attack them, they\u0027ll attack us first,\u0027 said Ibid. \u0027\u0027S\u0027right,\u0027 said Xeno. \u0027So we\u0027d better retaliate before they have a chance to strike.\u0027 The two philosophers stared uncomfortably at one another. \u0027On the other hand,\u0027 said Thid, \u0027war makes it very difficult to think straight.\u0027 \u0027There is that,\u0027 Xeno agreed. \u0027Especially for dead people.\u0027 There was an embarrassed silence, broken only by Ptraci\u0027s voice singing to the tortoise and the occasional squeak of stricken seagulls. \u0027What day is it?\u0027 said Ibid. \u0027Tuesday,\u0027 said Teppic. \u0027I think,\u0027 said Thid, \u0027that it might be a good idea if you came to the symposium. We have one every Tuesday,\u0027 he added. \u0027All the greatest minds in Ephebe will be there. All this needs thinking about.\u0027 He glanced at Ptraci. \u0027However,\u0027 he said, \u0027your young woman cannot attend, naturally. Females are absolutely forbidden. Their brains overheat.\u0027 King Teppicymon XXVII opened his eyes. It\u0027s bloody dark in here, he thought. And he realised that he could hear his own heart beating, but muffled, and some way off. And then he remembered. He was alive. He was alive again. And, this time, he was in bits. Somehow, he\u0027d assumed that you got assembled again once you got to the netherworld, like one of Grinjer\u0027s kits. Get a grip on yourself, man, he thought. It\u0027s up to you to pull yourself together. Right, he thought. There were at least six jars. So my eyes are in one of them. Getting the lid off would be favourite, so we can see what we\u0027re at. That\u0027s going to involve arms and legs and fingers. This is going to be really tricky. He reached out, tentatively, with stiff joints, and located something heavy. It felt as though it might give, so he moved his other arm into position, with a great deal of awkwardness, and pushed. There was a distant thump, and a definite feeling of openness above him. He sat up, creaking all the way. The sides of the ceremonial casket still hemmed him in, but to his surprise he found that one slow arm movement brushed them out of the way like paper. Must be all the pickle and stuffing, he thought. Gives you a bit of weight. He felt his way to the edge of the slab, lowered his heavy legs to the ground and, after a pause out of habit to wheeze a bit, took the first tottering lurch of the newly undead. It is astonishingly difficult to walk with legs full of straw when the brain doing the directing is in a pot ten feet away, but he made it as far as the wall and felt his way along it until a crash indicated that he\u0027d reached the shelf of jars. He fumbled the lids of the first one and dipped his hand gently inside. It must be brains, he thought maniacally, because semolina doesn\u0027t squidge like that. I\u0027ve collected my own thoughts, haha. He tried one or two more jars until an explosion of daylight told him he\u0027d found the one with his eyes in. He watched his own bandaged hand reach down, growing gigantic, and scoop them up carefully. That seems to be the important bits, he thought. The rest can wait until later. Maybe when I need to eat something, and so forth. He turned around, and realised that he was not alone. Dil and Gern were watching him. To squeeze any further into the far corner of the room, they would have needed triangular backbones. \u0027Ah. Ho there, good people,\u0027 said the king, aware that his voice was a little hollow. \u0027I know so much about you, I\u0027d like to shake you by the hand.\u0027 He looked down. \u0027Only they\u0027re rather full at the moment,\u0027 he added. \u0027Gkkk,\u0027 said Gern. \u0027You couldn\u0027t do a bit of reassembly, could you?\u0027 said the king, turning to Dil. \u0027Your stitches seem to be holding up nicely, by the way. Well done, that man.\u0027 Professional pride broke through the barrier of Dil\u0027s terror. \u0027You\u0027re alive?\u0027 he said. \u0027That was the general idea, wasn\u0027t it?\u0027 said the king. Dil nodded. Certainly it was. He\u0027d always believed it to be true. He\u0027d just never expected it ever actually to happen. But it had, and the first words, well, nearly the first words that had been said were in praise of his needlework. His chest swelled. No-one else in the Guild had ever been congratulated on their work by a recipient. \u0027There,\u0027 he said to Gern, whose shoulderblades were making a spirited attempt to dig their way through the wall. \u0027Hear what has been said to your master. The king paused. It was beginning to dawn on him that things weren\u0027t quite right here. Of course the netherworld was like this world, only better, and no doubt there were plenty of servants and so forth. But it seemed altogether far too much like this world. He was pretty sure that Dil and Gern shouldn\u0027t be in it yet. Anyway, he\u0027d always understood that the common people had their own netherworld, where they would be more at ease and could mingle with their own kind and wouldn\u0027t feel awkward and socially out of place. \u0027I say,\u0027 he said. \u0027I may have missed a bit here. You\u0027re not dead, are you?\u0027 Dil didn\u0027t answer immediately. Some of the things he\u0027d seen so far today had made him a bit uncertain on the subject. In the end, though, he was forced to admit that he probably was alive. \u0027Then what\u0027s happening?\u0027 said the king. \u0027We don\u0027t know, O king,\u0027 said Dil. \u0027Really we don\u0027t. It\u0027s all come true, O fount of waters!\u0027 \u0027What has?\u0027 \u0027Everything!\u0027 \u0027Everything?\u0027 \u0027The sun, O lord. And the gods! Oh, the gods! They\u0027re everywhere, O master of heaven!\u0027 \u0027We come in through the back way,\u0027 said Gern, who had dropped to his knees. \u0027Forgive us, O lord of justice, who has come back to deliver his mighty wisdom and that. I am sorry about me and Glwenda, it was a moment of wossname, mad passion, we couldn\u0027t control ourselves. Also, it was me-\u0027 Dil waved him into a devout silence. \u0027Excuse me,\u0027 he said to the king\u0027s mummy. \u0027But could we have a word away from the lad? Man to-\u0027 \u0027Corpse?\u0027 said the king, trying to make it easy for him. \u0027Certainly.\u0027 They wandered over to the other side of the room. \u0027The fact is, O gracious king of-\u0027 Dil began, in a conspiratorial whisper. \u0027I think we can dispense with all that,\u0027 said the king briskly. \u0027The dead don\u0027t stand on ceremony. “King” will be quite sufficient.\u0027 \u0027The fact is, then - king,\u0027 said Dil, experiencing a slight thrill at this equitable treatment, \u0027young Gern thinks it\u0027s all his fault. I\u0027ve told him over and over again that the gods wouldn\u0027t go to all this trouble just because of one growing lad with urges, if you catch my drift.\u0027 He paused, and added carefully, \u0027They wouldn\u0027t, would they?\u0027 \u0027Shouldn\u0027t think so for one minute,\u0027 said the king briskly. \u0027We\u0027d never see the back of them, otherwise.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s what I told him,\u0027 said Dil, immensely relieved. \u0027He\u0027s a good boy, sir, it\u0027s just that his mum is a bit funny about religion. We\u0027d never see the back of them, those were my very words. I\u0027d be very grateful if you could have a word with him, sir, you know, set his mind at rest-\u0027 \u0027Be happy to,\u0027 said the king graciously. Dil sidled closer. \u0027The fact is, sir, these gods, sir, they aren\u0027t right. We\u0027ve been watching, sir. At least, I have. I climbed on the roof. Gern didn\u0027t, he hid under the bench. They\u0027re not right, sir!\u0027 \u0027What\u0027s wrong with them?\u0027 \u0027Well, they\u0027re here, sir! That\u0027s not right, is it? I mean, not to be really here. And they\u0027re just striding around and fighting amongst themselves and shouting at people.\u0027 He looked both ways before continuing. \u0027Between you and me, sir,\u0027 he said, \u0027they don\u0027t seem too bright.\u0027 The king nodded. \u0027What are the priests doing about this?\u0027 he said. \u0027I saw them throwing one another in the river, sir.\u0027 The king nodded again. \u0027That sounds about right,\u0027 he said. \u0027They\u0027ve come to their senses at last.\u0027 \u0027You know what I think, sir?\u0027 said Dil earnestly. \u0027Everything we believe is coming true. And I heard something else, sir. This morning, if it was this morning, you understand, because the sun\u0027s all over the place, sir, and it\u0027s not the right sort of sun, but this morning some of the soldiers tried to get out along the Ephebe road, sir, and do you know what they found?\u0027 \u0027What did they find?\u0027 \u0027The road out, sir, leads in!\u0027 Dil took a step backwards the better to illustrate the seriousness of the revelations. \u0027They got up into the rocks and then suddenly they were walking down the Tsort road. It all sort of curves back on itself. We\u0027re shut in, sir. Shut in with our gods.\u0027 And I\u0027m shut in my body, thought the king. Everything we believe is true? And what we believe isn\u0027t what we think we believe. I mean, we think we believe that the gods are wise and just and powerful, but what we really believe is that they are like our father after a long day. And we think we believe the netherworld is a sort of paradise, but we really believe it\u0027s right here and you go to it in your body and I\u0027m in it and I\u0027m never going to get away. Never, ever. \u0027What\u0027s my son got to say about all this?\u0027 he said. Dil coughed. It was the ominous cough. The Spanish use an upside-down question mark to tell you what you\u0027re about to hear is a question; this was the kind of cough that tells you what you\u0027re about to hear is a dirge.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pyramids-discworld-7/page-28.html","bookId":1626,"book":{"id":1626,"title":"Pyramids (Discworld #7)","description":"Storyline: Pyramids (Discworld #7) It\u0027s bad enough being new on the job, but Teppic hasn\u0027t a clue as to what a pharaoh is supposed to do.
