{"id":95693,"no":29,"title":"Page 29","content":"\u0027Don\u0027t know how to tell you this, sir,\u0027 he said.\n \u0027Out with it, man.\u0027\n \u0027Sir, they say he\u0027s dead, sir. They say he killed himself and ran away.\n \u0027Killed himself?\u0027\n \u0027Sorry, sir.\u0027\n \u0027And ran away afterwards?\u0027\n \u0027On a camel, they say.\u0027\n \u0027We lead an active afterlife in our family, don\u0027t we?\u0027 observed the king dryly.\n \u0027Beg pardon, sir?\u0027\n \u0027I mean, the two statements could be held to be mutually exclusive.\u0027\n Dil\u0027s face became a well-meaning blank.\n \u0027That is to say, they can\u0027t both be true,\u0027 supplied the king, helpfully.\n \u0027Ahem,\u0027 said Dil.\n \u0027Yes, but I\u0027m a special case,\u0027 said the king testily. \u0027In this kingdom we believe you live after death only if you\u0027ve been mumm-\u0027\n He stopped.\n It was too horrible to think about. He thought about it, nevertheless, for some time.\n Then he said, \u0027We must do something about it.\u0027\n Dil said, \u0027Your son, sir?\u0027\n \u0027Never mind about my son, he\u0027s not dead, I\u0027d know about it,\u0027 snapped the king. \u0027He can look after himself, he\u0027s my son. It\u0027s my ancestors I\u0027m worried about.\u0027\n \u0027But they\u0027re dead-\u0027 Dil began.\n It has already been remarked that Dil had a very poor imagination. In a job like his a poor imagination was essential. But his mind\u0027s eye opened on a panorama of pyramids, stretching along the river, and his mind\u0027s ear swooped and curved through solid doors that no thief could penetrate.\n And it heard the scrabbling.\n And it heard the hammering.\n And it heard the muffled shouting.\n The king put a bandaged arm over his trembling shoulders.\n \u0027I know you\u0027re a good man with a needle, Dil,\u0027 he said. \u0027Tell me - how are you with a sledgehammer?\u0027\n Copolymer, the greatest storyteller in the history of the world, sat back and beamed at the greatest minds in the world, assembled at the dining table.\n Teppic had added another iota to his store of new knowledge. \u0027Symposium\u0027 meant a knife-and-fork tea.\n \u0027Well,\u0027 said Copolymer, and launched into the story of the Tsortean Wars.\n \u0027You see, what happened was, he\u0027d taken her back home, and her father - this wasn\u0027t the old king, this was the one before, the one with the wossname, he married some girl from over Elharib way, she had a squint, what was her name now, began with a P. Or an L. One of them letters, anyway. Her father owned an island out on the bay there, Papylos I think it was. No, I tell a lie, it was Crinix. Anyway, the king, the other king, he raised an army and they . . . Elenor, that was her name. She had a squint, you know. But quite attractive, they say. When I say married, I trust I do not have to spell it out for you. I mean, it was a bit unofficial. Er. Anyway, there was this wooden horse and after they\u0027d got in . . . Did I tell you about this horse? It was a horse. I\u0027m pretty sure it was a horse. Or maybe it was a chicken. Forget my own name next! It was wossname\u0027s idea, the one with the limp. Yes. The limp in his leg, I mean. Did I mention him? There\u0027d been this fight. No, that was the other one, I think. Yes. Anyway, this wooden pig, damn clever idea, they made it out of thing. Tip of my tongue. Wood. But that was later, you know. The fight! Nearly forgot the fight. Yes. Damn good fight. Everyone banging on their shields and yelling. Wossname\u0027s armour shone like shining armour. Fight and a half, that fight. Between thingy, not the one with the limp, the other one, wossname, had red hair. You know. Tall fellow, talked with a lisp. Hold on, just remembered, he was from some other island. Not him. The other one, with the limp. Didn\u0027t want to go, he said he was mad. Of course, he was bloody mad, definitely. I mean, a wooden cow! Like wossname said, the king, no, not that king, the other one, he saw the goat, he said, “I fear the Ephebians, especially when they\u0027re mad enough to leave bloody great wooden livestock on the doorstep, talk about nerve, they must think we was born yesterday, set fire to it,” and, of course, wossname had nipped in round the back and put everyone to the sword, talk about laugh. Did I say she had a squint? They said she was pretty, but it takes all sorts. Yes. Anyway, that\u0027s how it happened. Now, of course, wossname - I think he was called Melycanus, had a limp - he wanted to go home, well, you would, they\u0027d been there for years, he wasn\u0027t getting any younger. That\u0027s why he dreamt up the thing about the wooden wossname. Yes. I tell a lie, Lavaelous was the one with the knee. Pretty good fight, that fight, take it from me.\u0027\n He lapsed into self-satisfied silence.\n \u0027Pretty good fight,\u0027 he mumbled and, smiling faintly, dropped off to sleep.\n Teppic was aware that his own mouth was hanging open. He shut it. Along the table several of the diners were wiping their eyes.\n \u0027Magic,\u0027 said Xeno. \u0027Sheer magic. Every word a tassel on the canopy of Time.\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s the way he remembers every tiny detail. Pin-sharp,\u0027 murmured Ibid.\n Teppic looked down the length of the table, and then nudged Xeno beside him. \u0027Who is everyone?\u0027 he said.\n \u0027Well, Ibid you already know. And Copolymer. Over there, that\u0027s Iesope, the greatest teller of fables in the world. And that\u0027s Antiphon, the greatest writer of comic plays in the world.\u0027\n \u0027Where is Pthagonal?\u0027 said Teppic. Xeno pointed to the far end of the table, where a glum-looking, heavy-drinking man was trying to determine the angle between two bread rolls. \u0027I\u0027ll introduce you to him afterwards,\u0027 he said.\n Teppic looked around at the bald heads and long white beards, which seemed to be a badge of office. If you had a bald head and a long white beard, they seemed to indicate, whatever lay between them must be bursting with wisdom. The only exception was Antiphon, who looked as though he was built of pork.\n They are great minds, he told himself. These are men who are trying to work out how the world fits together, not by magic, not by religion, but just by inserting their brains in whatever crack they can find and trying to lever it apart.\n Ibid rapped on the table for silence.\n \u0027The Tyrant has called for war on Tsort,\u0027 he said. \u0027Now, let us consider the place of war in the ideal republic,\u0027 he said. \u0027We would require-\u0027\n \u0027Excuse me, could you just pass me the celery?\u0027 said Iesope. \u0027Thank you.\u0027\n \u0027-the ideal republic, as I was saying, based on the fundamental laws that govern-\u0027\n \u0027And the salt. It\u0027s just by your elbow.\u0027\n \u0027-the fundamental laws, that is, which govern all men. Now, it is without doubt true that war. . . could you stop that, please?\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s celery,\u0027 said Iesope, crunching cheerfully. \u0027You can\u0027t help it with celery.\u0027\n Xeno peered suspiciously at what was on his fork.\n \u0027Here, this is squid,\u0027 he said. \u0027I didn\u0027t ask for squid. Who ordered squid?\u0027\n \u0027-without doubt,\u0027 repeated Thid, raising his voice, \u0027without doubt, I put it to you-\n \u0027I think this is the lamb couscous,\u0027 said Antiphon.\n \u0027Was yours the squid?\u0027\n \u0027I asked for marida and dolmades.\u0027\n \u0027I ordered the lamb. Just pass it along, will you?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t remember anyone asking for all this garlic bread,\u0027 said Xeno.\n \u0027Look, some of us are trying to float a philosophical concept here,\u0027 said Ibid sarcastically. \u0027Don\u0027t let us interrupt you, will you?\u0027\n Someone threw a breadstick at him.\n Teppic looked at what was on his fork. Seafood was unknown in the kingdom, and what was on his fork had too many valves and suckers to be reassuring. He lifted a boiled vine leaf with extreme care, and was sure he saw something scuttle behind an olive.\n Ah. Something else to remember, then. The Ephebians made wine out of anything they could put in a bucket, and ate anything that couldn\u0027t climb out of one.\n He pushed the food around on his plate. Some of it pushed back.\n And philosophers didn\u0027t listen to one another. And they don\u0027t stick to the point. This probably is mocracy at work.\n A bread roll bounced past him. Oh, and they get over-excited.\n He noticed a skinny little man sitting opposite him, chewing primly on some anonymous tentacle. Apart from Pthagonal the geometrician, who was now gloomily calculating the radius of his plate, he was the only person not speaking his mind at the top of his voice. Sometimes he\u0027d make little notes on a piece of parchment and slip it into his toga.\n Teppic leaned across. Further down the table Iesope, encouraged by occasional olive stones and bread rolls, started a long fable about a fox, a turkey, a goose and a wolf, who had a wager to see who could stay longest underwater with heavy weights tied to their feet.\n \u0027Excuse me,\u0027 said Teppic, raising his voice above the din. \u0027Who are you?\u0027\n The little man gave him a shy look. He had extremely large ears. In a certain light, he could have been mistaken for a very thin jug.\n \u0027I\u0027m Endos,\u0027 he said.\n \u0027Why aren\u0027t you philosophising?\u0027\n Endos sliced a strange mollusc.\n \u0027I\u0027m not a philosopher, actually,\u0027 he said.\n \u0027Or a humorous playwright or something?\u0027 said Teppic.\n \u0027I\u0027m afraid not. I\u0027m a Listener. Endos the Listener, I\u0027m known as.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s fascinating,\u0027 said Teppic automatically. \u0027What does that involve?\u0027\n \u0027Listening.\u0027\n \u0027Just listening?\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s what they pay me for,\u0027 said Endos. \u0027Sometimes I nod. Or smile. Or nod and smile at the same time. Encouragingly, you know. They like that.\u0027\n Teppic felt he was called upon to comment at this point. \u0027Gosh,\u0027 he said.\n Endos gave him an encouraging nod, and a smile that suggested that of all the things Endos could be doing in the world right at this minute there was nothing so basically riveting as listening to Teppic. It was something about his ears. They appeared to be a vast aural black hole, begging to be filled up with words. Teppic felt an overpowering urge to tell him all about his life and hopes and dreams...\n \u0027I bet,\u0027 he said, \u0027that they pay you an awful lot of money.\n Endos gave him a heartening smile.\n \u0027Have you listened to Copolymer tell his story lots of times?\u0027\n Endos nodded and smiled, although there was a faint trace of pain right behind his eyes.\n \u0027I expect,\u0027 said Teppic, \u0027that your ears develop protective rough surfaces after a while?\u0027\n Endos nodded. \u0027Do go on,\u0027 he urged.\n Teppic glanced across at Pthagonal, who was moodily drawing right angles in his taramasalata.\n \u0027I\u0027d love to stay and listen to you listening to me all day,\u0027 he said. \u0027But there\u0027s a man over there I\u0027d like to see.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s amazing,\u0027 said Endos, making a short note and turning his attention to a conversation further along the table. A philosopher had averred that although truth was beauty, beauty was not necessarily truth, and a fight was breaking out. Endos listened carefully.[27]\n Teppic wandered along the table to where Pthagonal was sitting in unrelieved misery, and currently peering suspiciously over the crust of a pie.\n Teppic looked over his shoulder.\n \u0027I think I saw something moving in there,\u0027 he said.\n \u0027Ah,\u0027 said the geometrician, taking the cork out of an amphora with his teeth. \u0027The mysterious young man in black from the lost kingdom.\u0027\n \u0027I was hoping you could help me find it again?\u0027 said Teppic.\n \u0027I heard that you have some very unusual ideas in Ephebe.\u0027\n \u0027It had to happen,\u0027 said Pthagonal. He pulled a pair of dividers from the folds of his robe and measured the pie thoughtfully. \u0027Is it a constant, do you think? It\u0027s a depressing concept.\u0027\n \u0027Sorry?\u0027 said Teppic.\n \u0027The diameter divides into the circumference, you know. It ought to be three times. You\u0027d think so, wouldn\u0027t you? But does it? No. Three point one four one and lots of other figures. There\u0027s no end to the buggers. Do you know how pissed off that makes me?\u0027\n \u0027I expect it makes you extremely pissed off,\u0027 said Teppic politely.\n \u0027Right. It tells me that the Creator used the wrong kind of circles. It\u0027s not even a proper number! I mean, three point five, you could respect. Or three point three. That\u0027d look right.\u0027 He stared morosely at the pie. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pyramids-discworld-7/page-29.html","bookId":1626,"book":{"id":1626,"title":"Pyramids (Discworld #7)","description":"Storyline: \n Pyramids (Discworld #7) \n It\u0027s bad enough being new on the job, but Teppic hasn\u0027t a clue as to what a pharaoh is supposed to do.
