{"id":95681,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"Teppic cut Dios off in mid-intone. \u0027Having listened to both sides of the case,\u0027 he said firmly, the mask giving it a slight boom, \u0027and, being impressed by the argument and counter-argument, it seems to us only just that the beast in question should be slaughtered without delay and shared with all fairness between both plaintiff and defendant.\u0027 He sat back. They\u0027ll call me Teppic the Wise, he thought. The common people go for this sort of thing. The farmers gave him a long blank stare. Then, as if they were both mounted on turntables, they turned and looked to where Dios was sitting in his place on the steps in a group of lesser priests. Dios stood up, smoothed his plain robe, and extended the staff. \u0027Harken to the interpreted wisdom of His Greatness the King Teppicymon XXVIII, Lord of the Heavens, Charioteer of the Wagon of the Sun, Steersman of the Barque of the Sun, Guardian of the Secret Knowledge, Lord of the Horizon, Keeper of the Way, the Flail of Mercy, the High-Born One, the Never-Dying King,\u0027 he said. \u0027It is our divine judgement that the beast in dispute is the property of Rhumusphut. It is our divine judgement that the beast be sacrificed upon the altar of the Concourse of Gods in thanks for the attention of Our Divine Self. It is our further judgement that both Rhumusphut and Ktoffle work a further three days in the fields of the King in payment for this judgement.\u0027 Dios raised his head until he was looking along his fearsome nose right into Teppic\u0027s mask. He raised both hands. \u0027Mighty is the wisdom of His Greatness the King Teppicymon XXVIII, Lord of the Heavens, Charioteer of the Wagon of the Sun, Steersman of the Barque of the Sun, Guardian of the Secret Knowledge, Lord of the Horizon, Keeper of the Way, the Flail of Mercy, the High-Born One, the Never-Dying King!\u0027 The farmers bobbed in terrified gratitude and backed out of the presence, framed between the guards. \u0027Dios,\u0027 said Teppic, levelly. \u0027Sire?\u0027 \u0027Just attend upon me a moment, please?\u0027 \u0027Sire?\u0027 repeated Dios, materialising by the throne. \u0027I could not help noticing, Dios, excuse me if I am wrong, a certain flourish in the translation there.\u0027 The priest looked surprised. \u0027Indeed no, sire. I was most precise in relaying your decision, saving only to refine the detail in accordance with precedent and tradition.\u0027 \u0027How was that? The damn creature really belonged to both of them!\u0027 \u0027But Rhumusphut is known to be punctilious in his devotions, sire, seeking every opportunity to laud and magnify the gods, whereas Ktoffle has been known to harbour foolish thoughts.\u0027 \u0027What\u0027s that got to do with justice?\u0027 \u0027Everything, sire,\u0027 said Dios smoothly. \u0027But now neither of them has the ox!\u0027 \u0027Quite so, sire. But Ktoffle does not have it because he does not deserve it, while Rhumusphut, by his sacrifice, has ensured himself greater stature in the netherworld.\u0027 \u0027And you\u0027ll eat beef tonight, I suppose,\u0027 said Teppic. It was like a blow; Teppic might as well have picked up the throne and hit the priest with it. Dios took a step backward, aghast, his eyes two brief pools of pain. When he spoke, there was a raw edge to his voice. \u0027I do not eat meat, sire,\u0027 he said. \u0027It dilutes and tarnishes the soul. May I summon the next case, sire?\u0027 Teppic nodded. \u0027Very well.\u0027 The next case was a dispute over the rent of a hundred square yards of riverside land. Teppic listened carefully. Good growing land was at a premium in Djeli, since the pyramids took up so much of it. It was a serious matter. It was especially serious because the land\u0027s tenant was by all accounts hard-working and conscientious, while its actual owner was clearly rich and objectionable[19]. Unfortunately, however one chose to stack the facts, he was also in the right. Teppic thought deeply, and then squinted at Dios. The priest nodded at him. \u0027It seems to me-\u0027 said Teppic, as fast as possible but not fast enough. \u0027Harken to the judgement of His Greatness the King Teppicymon XXVIII, Lord of the Heavens, Charioteer of the Wagon of the Sun, Steersman of the Barque of the Sun, Guardian of the Secret Knowledge, Lord of the Horizon, Keeper of the Way, the Flail of Mercy, the High-Born One, the Never-Dying King!\u0027 \u0027It seems to me - to us,\u0027 Teppic repeated, \u0027that, taking all matters in consideration beyond those of mere mortal artifice, the true and just outcome in this matter-\u0027 He paused. This, he thought, isn\u0027t how a good king speaks. \u0027The landlord has been weighed in the balance and found wanting,\u0027 he boomed through the mask\u0027s mouth slit. \u0027We find for the tenant.\u0027 As one man the court turned to Dios, who held a whispered consultation with the other priests and then stood up. \u0027Hear now the interpreted word of His Greatness the King Teppicymon XXVIII, Lord of the Heavens, Charioteer of the Wagon of the Sun, Steersman of the Barque of the Sun, Guardian of the Secret Knowledge, Lord of the Horizon, Keeper of the Way, the Flail of Mercy, the High-Born One, the Never-Dying King! Ptorne the farmer will at once pay 18 toons in back rent to Prince Imtebos! Prince Imbetos will at once pay 12 toons into the temple offerings of the gods of the river! Long live the king! Bring on the next case!\u0027 Teppic beckoned to Dios again. \u0027Is there any point in me being here?\u0027 he demanded in an overheated whisper. \u0027Please be calm, sire. If you were not here, how would the people know that justice had been done?\u0027 \u0027But you twist everything I say!\u0027 \u0027No, sire. Sire, you give the judgement of the man. I interpret the judgement of the king.\u0027 \u0027I see,\u0027 said Teppic grimly. \u0027Well, from now on-\u0027 There was a commotion outside the hall. Clearly there was a prisoner outside who was less than confident in the king\u0027s justice, and the king didn\u0027t blame him. He wasn\u0027t at all happy about it, either. It turned out to be a dark-haired girl, struggling in the arms of two guards and giving them the kind of blows with fist and heel that a man would blush to give. She wasn\u0027t wearing the right kind of costume for the job, either. It would be barely adequate for lying around peeling grapes in. She saw Teppic and, to his secret delight, flashed him a glance of pure hatred. After an afternoon of being treated like a mentally-deficient statue it was a pleasure to find someone prepared to take an interest in him. He didn\u0027t know what she had done, but judging by the thumps she was landing on the guards it was a pretty good bet that she had done it to the very limits of her ability. Dios bent down to the level of the mask\u0027s ear holes. \u0027Her name is Ptraci,\u0027 he said. \u0027A handmaiden of your father. She has refused to take the potion.\u0027 \u0027What potion?\u0027 said Teppic. \u0027It is customary for a dead king to take servants with him into the netherworld, sire.\u0027 Teppic nodded gloomily. It was a jealously-guarded privilege, the only way a penniless servant could ensure immortality. He remembered grandfather\u0027s funeral, and the discreet clamour of the old man\u0027s personal servants. It had made father depressed for days. \u0027Yes, but it\u0027s not compulsory,\u0027 he said. \u0027Yes, sire. It is not compulsory.\u0027 \u0027Father had plenty of servants.\u0027 \u0027I gather she was his favourite, sire.\u0027 \u0027What exactly has she done wrong, then?\u0027 Dios sighed, as one might if one were explaining things to an extremely backward child. \u0027She has refused to take the potion, sire.\u0027 \u0027Sorry. I thought you said it wasn\u0027t compulsory, Dios.\u0027 \u0027Yes, sire. It is not, sire. It is entirely voluntary. It is an act of free will. And she has refused it, sire.\u0027 \u0027Ah. One of those situations,\u0027 said Teppic. Djelibeybi was built on those sort of situations. Trying to understand them could drive you mad. If one of his ancestors had decreed that night was day, people would go around groping in the light. He leaned forward. \u0027Step forward, young lady,\u0027 he said. She looked at Dios. \u0027His Greatness the King Teppicymon XXVIII-\u0027 \u0027Do we have to go all through that every time?\u0027 \u0027Yes, sire - Lord of the Heavens, Charioteer of the Wagon of the Sun, Steersman of the Barque of the Sun, Guardian of the Secret Knowledge, Lord of the Horizon, Keeper of the Way, the Flail of Mercy, the High-Born One, the Never-Dying King, bids you declare your guilt!\u0027 The girl shook herself out of the guards\u0027 grip and faced Teppic, trembling with terror. \u0027He told me he didn\u0027t want to be buried in a pyramid,\u0027 she said. \u0027He said the idea of those millions of tons of rock on top of him gave him nightmares. I don\u0027t want to die yet!\u0027 \u0027You refuse to gladly take the poison?\u0027 said Dios. \u0027Yes!\u0027 \u0027But, child,\u0027 said Dios, \u0027then the king will have you put to death anyway. Surely it is better to go honourably, to a worthy life in the netherworld?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t want to be a servant in the netherworld!\u0027 There was a groan of horror from the assembled priests. Dios nodded. \u0027Then the Eater of Souls will take you,\u0027 he said. \u0027Sire, we look to your judgement.\u0027 Teppic realised he was staring at the girl. There was something hauntingly familiar about her which he couldn\u0027t quite put his finger on. \u0027Let her go,\u0027 he said. \u0027His Greatness the King Teppicymon XXVIII, Lord of the Heavens, Charioteer of the Wagon of the Sun, Steersman of the Barque of the Sun, Guardian of the Secret Knowledge, Lord of the Horizon, Keeper of the Way, the Flail of Mercy, the High-Born One, the Never-Dying King, has spoken! Tomorrow at dawn you will be cast to the crocodiles of the river. Great is the wisdom of the king!\u0027 Ptraci turned and glared at Teppic. He said nothing. He did not dare, for fear of what it might become. She went away quietly, which was worse than sobbing or shouting. \u0027That is the last case, sire,\u0027 said Dios. \u0027I will retire to my quarters,\u0027 said Teppic coldly. \u0027I have much to think about.\u0027 \u0027Therefore I will have dinner sent in,\u0027 said the priest. \u0027It will be roast chicken.\u0027 \u0027I hate chicken.\u0027 Dios smiled. \u0027No, sire. On Wednesdays the king always enjoys chicken, sire.\u0027 The pyramids flared. The light they cast on the landscape was curiously subdued, grainy, almost grey, but over the capstone of each tomb a zigzag flame crackled towards the sky. A faint click of metal and stone sprang Ptraci from a fitful doze into extreme wakefulness. She stood up very carefully and crept towards the window. Unlike proper cell windows, which should be large and airy and requiring only the removal of a few inconvenient iron bars to ensure the escape of any captives, this window was a slit six inches wide. Seven thousand years had taught the kings along the Djel that cells should be designed to keep prisoners in. The only way they could get out through this slit was in bits. But there was a shadow against the pyramid light, and a voice said, \u0027Psst.\u0027 She flattened herself against the wall and tried to reach up to the slit. \u0027Who are you?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m here to help you. Oh damn. Do they call this a window? Look, I\u0027m lowering a rope.\u0027 A thick silken cord, knotted at intervals, dropped past her shoulder. She stared at it for a second or two, and then kicked off her curly-toed shoes and climbed up it. The face on the other side of the slit was half-concealed by a black hood, but she could just make out a worried expression. \u0027Don\u0027t despair,\u0027 it said. \u0027I wasn\u0027t despairing. I was trying to get some sleep.\u0027 \u0027Oh. Pardon me, I\u0027m sure. I\u0027ll just go away and leave you, shall I?\u0027 \u0027But in the morning I shall wake up and then I\u0027ll despair. What are you standing on, demon?\u0027 \u0027Do you know what a crampon is?\u0027 \u0027No.\u0027 \u0027Well, it\u0027s two of them.\u0027 They stared at each other in silence. \u0027Okay,\u0027 said the face at last. \u0027I\u0027ll have to go around and come in through the door. Don\u0027t go away.\u0027 And with that it vanished upwards.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pyramids-discworld-7/page-17.html","bookId":1626,"book":{"id":1626,"title":"Pyramids (Discworld #7)","description":"Storyline: Pyramids (Discworld #7) It\u0027s bad enough being new on the job, but Teppic hasn\u0027t a clue as to what a pharaoh is supposed to do.
