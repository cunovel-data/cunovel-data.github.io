That was it. \u0027We\u0027ll go to Ephebe,\u0027 he said. \u0027They know all about geometry and they have some very unsound ideas. Unsound ideas are what I could do with right now.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why do you carry all these knives and things? I mean, really?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hmm? Sorry?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All these knives. Why?\u0027\\n\\n Teppic thought about it. \u0027I suppose I don\u0027t feel properly dressed without them,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027Oh.\u0027\\n\\n Ptraci dutifully cast around for a new topic of conversation. Introducing Topics of Amusing Discourse was also part of a handmaiden\u0027s duties. She\u0027d never been particularly good at it. The other girls had come up with an astonishing assortment: everything from the mating habits of crocodiles to speculation about life in the netherworld. She\u0027d found it heavy going after talking about the weather.\\n\\n \u0027So,\u0027 she said. \u0027You\u0027ve killed a lot of people, I expect?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Mm?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027As an assassin, I mean. You get paid to kill people. Have you killed lots? Do you know you tense your back muscles a lot?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t think I ought to talk about it,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027I ought to know. If we\u0027ve got to cross the desert together and everything. More than a hundred?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Good heavens, no.,\\n\\n \u0027Well, less than fifty?\u0027\\n\\n Teppic rolled over.\\n\\n \u0027Look, even the most famous assassins never killed more than thirty people in all their lives,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027Less than twenty, then?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Less than ten?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I think,\u0027 said Teppic, \u0027it would be best to say a number between zero and ten.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Just so long as I know. These things are important.\u0027 They strolled back to You Bastard. But now it was Teppic who seemed to have something on his mind.\\n\\n \u0027All this senate . . .\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027Congress,\u0027 corrected Ptraci.\\n\\n \u0027You . . . er . . . more than fifty people?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s a different name for that sort of woman,\u0027 said Ptraci, but without much rancour.\\n\\n \u0027Sorry. Less than ten?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Let\u0027s say,\u0027 said Ptraci, \u0027a number between zero and ten.\u0027 You Bastard spat. Twenty feet away the blowfly was picked cleanly out of the air and glued to the rock behind it.\\n\\n \u0027Amazing how they do it, isn\u0027t it,\u0027 said Teppic. \u0027Animal instinct, I suppose.\u0027\\n\\n You Bastard gave him a haughty glare from under his sweep-the-desert eyelashes and thought:\\n\\n . . . Let z\u003dei0. cudcudcud Then dz\u003die[i0]d0\u003dizd0 or d0\u003ddz/iz . . .\\n\\n Ptaclusp, still in his nightshirt, wandered aimlessly among the wreckage at the foot of the pyramid.\\n\\n It was humming like a turbine. Ptaclusp didn\u0027t know why, knew nothing about the vast expenditure of power that had twisted the dimensions by ninety degrees and was holding them there against terrible pressures, but at least the disturbing temporal changes seemed to have stopped. There were fewer sons around than there used to be; in truth, he could have done with finding one or two.\\n\\n First he found the capstone, which had shattered, its electrum sheathing peeling away. In its descent from the pyramid it had hit the statue of Hat the Vulture-Headed God, bending it double and giving it an expression of mild surprise.\\n\\n A faint groan sent him tugging at the wreckage of a tent. He tore at the heavy canvas and unearthed IIb, who blinked at him in the grey light.\\n\\n \u0027It didn\u0027t work, dad!\u0027 he moaned. \u0027We\u0027d almost got it up there, and then the whole thing just sort of twisted!\u0027\\n\\n The builder lifted a spar off his son\u0027s legs.\\n\\n \u0027Anything broken?\u0027 he said quietly.\\n\\n \u0027Just bruised, I think.\u0027 The young architect sat up, wincing, and craned to see around.\\n\\n \u0027Where\u0027s Two-ay?\u0027 he said. \u0027He was higher up than me, nearly on the top-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve found him,\u0027 said Ptaclusp.\\n\\n Architects are not known for their attention to subtle shades of meaning, but IIb heard the lead in his father\u0027s voice.\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027s not dead, is he?\u0027 he whispered.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t think so. I\u0027m not sure. He\u0027s alive. But. He\u0027s moving - he\u0027s moving . . . well, you better come and see. I think something quantum has happened to him.\u0027\\n\\n You Bastard plodded onwards at about 1.247 metres per second, working out complex conjugate co-ordinates to stave off boredom while his huge, plate-like feet crunched on the sand.\\n\\n Lack of fingers was another big spur to the development of camel intellect. Human mathematical development had always been held back by everyone\u0027s instinctive tendency, when faced with something really complex in the way of triform polynomials or parametric differentials, to count fingers. Camels started from the word go by counting numbers.\\n\\n Deserts were a great help, too. There aren\u0027t many distractions. As far as camels were concerned, the way to mighty intellectual development was to have nothing much to do and nothing to do it with.\\n\\n He reached the crest of the dune, gazed with approval over the rolling sands ahead of him, and began to think in logarithms.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s Ephebe like?\u0027 said Ptraci.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve never been there. Apparently it\u0027s ruled by a Tyrant.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I hope we don\u0027t meet him, then.\u0027\\n\\n Teppic shook his head. \u0027It\u0027s not like that,\u0027 he said. \u0027They have a new Tyrant every five years and they\u0027do something to him first.\u0027 He hesitated. \u0027I think they ee-lect him.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Is that something like they do to tomcats and bulls and things?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Er.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You know. To make them stop fighting and be more peaceful.\u0027\\n\\n Teppic winced. \u0027To be honest, I\u0027m not sure,\u0027 he said. \u0027But I don\u0027t think so. They\u0027ve got something they do it with, I think it\u0027s called a mocracy, and it means everyone in the whole country can say who the new Tyrant is. One man, one-\u0027 He paused. The political history lesson seemed a very long while ago, and had introduced concepts never heard of in Djelibeybi or in Ankh-Morpork, for that matter. He had a stab at it, anyway. \u0027One man, one vet.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s for the eelecting, then?\u0027\\n\\n He shrugged. It might be, for all he knew. \u0027The point is, though, that everyone can do it. They\u0027re very proud of it. Everyone has-\u0027 he hesitated again, certain now that things were amiss - \u0027the vet. Except for women, of course. And children. And criminals. And slaves. And stupid people. And people of foreign extraction. And people disapproved of for, er, various reasons. And lots of other people. But everyone apart from them. It\u0027s a very enlightened civilisation.\u0027\\n\\n Ptraci gave this some consideration.\\n\\n \u0027And that\u0027s a mocracy, is it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They invented it in Ephebe, you know,\u0027 said Teppic, feeling obscurely that he ought to defend it.\\n\\n \u0027I bet they had trouble exporting it,\u0027 said Ptraci firmly.\\n\\n The sun wasn\u0027t just a ball of flaming dung pushed across the sky by a giant beetle. It was also a boat. It depended on how you looked at it.\\n\\n The light was wrong. It had a flat quality, like water left in a glass for weeks. There was no joy to it. It illuminated, but without life; like bright moonlight rather than the light of day.\\n\\n But Ptaclusp was more worried about his son.\\n\\n \u0027Do you know what\u0027s wrong with him?\u0027 he said.\\n\\n His other son bit his stylus miserably. His hand was hurting. He\u0027d tried to touch his brother, and the crackling shock had taken the skin off his fingers.\\n\\n \u0027I might,\u0027 he ventured.\\n\\n \u0027Can you cure it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t think so.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What is it, then?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, dad. When we were up on the pyramid . . . well, when it couldn\u0027t flare . . . you see, I\u0027m sure it twisted around . . . time, you see, is just another dimension . . . um.\u0027\\n\\n Ptaclusp rolled his eyes. \u0027None of that architect\u0027s talk, boy,\u0027 he said. \u0027What\u0027s wrong with him?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I think he\u0027s dimensionally maladjusted, dad. Time and space has got a bit mixed up for him. That\u0027s why he\u0027s moving sideways all the time.\u0027\\n\\n Ptaclusp IIb gave his father a brave little smile.\\n\\n \u0027He always used to move sideways,\u0027 said Ptaclusp. His son sighed. \u0027Yes, dad,\u0027 he said. \u0027But that was just normal. All accountants move like that. Now he\u0027s moving sideways because that\u0027s like, well, it\u0027s like Time to him.\u0027 Ptaclusp frowned. Drifting gently sideways wasn\u0027t IIa\u0027s only problem. He was also flat. Not flat like a card, with a front, back and edge - but flat from any direction.\\n\\n \u0027Puts me exactly in mind of them people in the frescoes,\u0027 he said. \u0027Where\u0027s his depth, or whatever you call it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I think that\u0027s in Time,\u0027 said IIb, helplessly. \u0027Ours, not his.\u0027\\n\\n Ptaclusp walked around his son, noting how the flatness followed him. He scratched his chin.\\n\\n \u0027So he can walk in Time, can he?\u0027 he said slowly.\\n\\n \u0027That may be possible, yes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Do you think we could persuade him to stroll back a few months and tell us not to build that bloody pyramid?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He can\u0027t communicate, dad.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not much change there, then.\u0027 Ptaclusp sat down on the rubble, his head in his hands. It had come to this. One son normal and stupid, one flat as a shadow. And what sort of life could the poor flat kid have? He\u0027d go through life being used to open locks, clean the ice off windscreens, and sleeping cheaply in trouser-presses in hotel bedrooms[24]. Being able to get under doors and read books without opening them would not be much of a compensation. IIa drifted sideways, a flat cut-out on the landscape.\\n\\n \u0027Can\u0027t we do anything?\u0027 he said. \u0027Roll him up neatly, or something?\u0027\\n\\n IIb shrugged. \u0027We could put something in the way. That might be a good idea. It would stop anything worse happening to him because it, er, wouldn\u0027t have time to happen in. I think.\u0027\\n\\n They pushed the bent statue of Hat the Vulture-Headed God into the flat one\u0027s path. After a minute or two his gentle sideways drift brought him up against it. There was a fat blue spark that melted part of the statue, but the movement stopped.\\n\\n \u0027Why the sparks?\u0027 said Ptaclusp.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s a bit like flarelight, I think.\u0027\\n\\n Ptaclusp hadn\u0027t got where he was today - no, he\u0027d have to correct himself - hadn\u0027t got to where he had been last night without eventually seeing the advantages in the Unlikeliest situations.\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027ll save on clothing,\u0027 he said slowly. \u0027I mean, he can just paint it on.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t think you\u0027ve quite got the idea, dad,\u0027 said IIb wearily. He sat down beside his father and stared across the river to the palace.\\n\\n \u0027Something going on over there,\u0027 said Ptaclusp. \u0027Do you think they\u0027ve noticed the pyramid?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I shouldn\u0027t be surprised. It\u0027s moved around ninety degrees, after all.\u0027\\n\\n Ptaclusp looked over his shoulder, and nodded slowly.\\n\\n \u0027Funny, that,\u0027 he said. \u0027Bit of structural instability there.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Dad, it\u0027s a pyramid! We should have flared it! I told you! The forces involved, well, it\u0027s just too-\u0027\\n\\n A shadow fell across them. They looked around. They looked up. They looked up a bit more.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, my,\u0027 said Ptaclusp. \u0027It\u0027s Hat, the Vulture-Headed God...\u0027\\n\\n Ephebe lay beyond them, a classical poem of white marble lazing around its rock on a bay of brilliant blue-\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s that?\u0027 said Ptraci, after studying it critically for some time.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s the sea,\u0027 said Teppic. \u0027I told you, remember. Waves and things.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You said it was all green and rough.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sometimes it is.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hmm.\u0027 The tone of voice suggested that she disapproved of the sea but, before she could explain why, they heard the sound of voices raised in anger. They were coming from behind a nearby sand dune.\\n\\n There was a notice on the dune.\\n\\n It said, in several languages: AXIOM TESTING STATION.\\n\\n Below it, in slightly smaller writing, it added: CAUTION - UNRESOLVED POSTULATES.\\n\\n As they read it, or at least as Teppic read it and Ptraci didn\u0027t, there was a twang from behind the dune, followed by a click, followed by an arrow zipping overhead. You Bastard glanced up at it briefly and then turned his head and stared fixedly at a very small area of sand.\\n\\n A second later the arrow thudded into it.\\n\\n Then he tested the weight on his feet and did a small calculation which revealed that two people had been subtracted from his back. Further summation indicated that they had been added to the dune. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pyramids-discworld-7/page-25.html","bookId":1626,"book":{"id":1626,"title":"Pyramids (Discworld #7)","description":"Storyline: Pyramids (Discworld #7) \\n It\u0027s bad enough being new on the job, but Teppic hasn\u0027t a clue as to what a pharaoh is supposed to do.
