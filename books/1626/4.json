They\u0027re just made of stone.\u0027 Teppic sighed. \u0027We\u0027ve got lots of stone,\u0027 he said, \u0027and sand. Stone and sand. We\u0027re really big on them. If you ever need any stone and sand, we\u0027re the people for you. It\u0027s fitting out the insides that is really expensive. We\u0027re still avoiding paying for grandfather\u0027s, and that wasn\u0027t very big. Just three chambers.\u0027 Teppic turned and looked out of the window; they were back in the dormitory at this point.\\n\\n \u0027The whole kingdom\u0027s in debt,\u0027 he said, quietly. \u0027I mean even our debts are in debt. That\u0027s why I\u0027m here, really. Someone in our house needs to earn some money. A royal prince can\u0027t hang around looking ornamental any more. He\u0027s got to get out and do something useful in the community.\u0027\\n\\n Chidder leaned on the window sill.\\n\\n \u0027Couldn\u0027t you take some of the stuff out of the pyramids, then?\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t be silly.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sorry.\u0027\\n\\n Teppic gloomily watched the figures below.\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s a lot of people here,\u0027 he said, to change the subject. \u0027I didn\u0027t realise it would be so big.\u0027 He shivered. \u0027Or so cold,\u0027 he added.\\n\\n \u0027People drop out all the time,\u0027 said Chidder. \u0027Can\u0027t stand the course. The important thing is to know what\u0027s what and who\u0027s who. See that fellow over there?\u0027\\n\\n Teppic followed his pointing finger to a group of older students, who were lounging against the pillars by the entrance.\\n\\n \u0027The big one? Face like the end of your boot?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s Fliemoe. Watch out for him. If he invites you for toast in his study, don\u0027t go.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And who\u0027s the little kid with the curls?\u0027 said Teppic. He pointed to a small lad receiving the attentions of a washed-out looking lady. She was licking her handkerchief and dabbing apparent smudges off his face. When she stopped that, she straightened his tie.\\n\\n Chidder craned to see. \u0027Oh, just some new kid,\u0027 he said. \u0027Arthur someone. Still hanging on to his mummy, I see. He won\u0027t last long.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, I don\u0027t know,\u0027 said Teppic. \u0027We do, too, and we\u0027ve lasted for thousands of years.\u0027\\n\\n A disc of glass dropped into the silent building and tinkled on the floor. There was no other sound for several minutes. Then there was the faint clonk-clonk of an oil can. A shadow that had been lying naturally on the window sill, a morgue for blue-bottles, turned out to be an arm which was moving with vegetable slowness towards the window\u0027s catch.\\n\\n There was a scrape of metal, and then the whole window swung out in tribological silence.\\n\\n Teppic dropped over the sill and vanished into the shadow below it.\\n\\n For a minute or two the dusty space was filled with the intense absence of noise caused by someone moving with extreme care. Once again there was the squirting of oil, and then a metallic whisper as the bolt of a trapdoor leading on to the roof moved gently aside.\\n\\n Teppic waited for his breath to catch up with him, and in that moment heard the sound. It was down among the white noise at the edge of hearing, but there was no doubt about it. Someone was waiting just above the trapdoor, and they\u0027d just put their hand on a piece of paper to stop it rattling in the breeze.\\n\\n His own hand dropped from the bolt. He eased his way with exquisite care back across the greasy floor and felt his way along a rough wooden wall until he came to the door. This time he took no chances, but uncorked his oil can and let a silent drop fall on to the hinges.\\n\\n A moment later he was through. A rat, idly patrolling the draughty passage beyond, had to stop itself from swallowing its own tongue as he floated past.\\n\\n There was another doorway at the end, and a maze of musty storerooms until he found a stairway. He judged himself to be about thirty yards from the trapdoor. There hadn\u0027t been any flues that he could see. There ought to be a clear shot across the roof.\\n\\n He hunkered down and pulled out his knife roll, its velvet blackness making a darker oblong in the shadows. He selected a Number Five, not everyone\u0027s throwing knife, but worthwhile if you had the trick of it.\\n\\n Shortly afterwards his head rose very carefully over the edge of the roof, one arm bent behind it but ready to uncurl in a complex interplay of forces that would combine to send a few ounces of steel gliding across the night.\\n\\n Mericet was sitting by the trapdoor, looking at his clipboard. Teppic\u0027s eyes swivelled to the oblong of the plank bridge, stored meticulously against the parapet a few feet away.\\n\\n He was certain he had made no noise. He\u0027d have to swear that the examiner heard the sound of his gaze falling on him.\\n\\n The old man raised his bald head.\\n\\n \u0027Thank you, Mr Teppic,\u0027 he said, \u0027you may proceed.\u0027\\n\\n Teppic felt the sweat of his body grow cold. He stared at the plank, and then at the examiner, and then at his knife. \u0027Y\u0027s, sir,\u0027 he said. This didn\u0027t seem like enough, in the circumstances. He added, \u0027Thank you, sir.\u0027\\n\\n He\u0027d always remember the first night in the dormitory. It was long enough to accommodate all eighteen boys in Viper House, and draughty enough to accommodate the great outdoors. Its designer may have had comfort in mind, but only so that he could avoid it wherever possible: he had contrived a room that could actually be colder than the weather outside.\\n\\n \u0027I thought we got rooms to ourselves,\u0027 said Teppic.\\n\\n Chidder, who had laid claim to the least exposed bed in the whole refrigerator, nodded at him.\\n\\n \u0027Later on,\u0027 he said. He lay back, and winced. \u0027Do they sharpen these springs, do you reckon?\u0027\\n\\n Teppic said nothing. The bed was in fact rather more comfortable than the one he\u0027d slept in at home. His parents, being high born, naturally tolerated conditions for their children which would have been rejected out of hand by destitute sandflies.\\n\\n He stretched out on the thin mattress and analysed the day\u0027s events. He\u0027d been enrolled as an assassin, all right, a student assassin, for more than seven hours and they hadn\u0027t even let him lay a hand on a knife yet. Of course, tomorrow was another day . . .\\n\\n Chidder leaned over.\\n\\n \u0027Where\u0027s Arthur?\u0027 he said.\\n\\n Teppic looked at the bed opposite him. There was a pathetically small sack of clothing positioned neatly in its centre, but no sign of its intended occupant.\\n\\n \u0027Do you think he\u0027s run away?\u0027 he said, staring around at the shadows.\\n\\n \u0027Could be,\u0027 said Chidder. \u0027It happens a lot, you know. Mummy\u0027s boys, away from home for the first time-\u0027\\n\\n The door at the end of the room swung open slowly and Arthur entered, backwards, tugging a large and very reluctant billy goat. It fought him every step of the way down the aisle between the bedsteads.\\n\\n The boys watched in silence for several minutes as he tethered the animal to the end of his bed, upended the sack on the blankets, and took out several black candles, a sprig of herbs, a rope of skulls, and a piece of chalk. Taking the chalk, and adopting the shiny, pink-faced expression of someone who is going to do what they know to be right no matter what, Arthur drew a double circle around his bed and then, getting down on his chubby knees, filled the space between them with as unpleasant a collection of occult symbols as Teppic. had ever seen. When they were completed to his satisfaction he placed the candles at strategic points and lit them; they spluttered and gave off a smell that suggested that you really wouldn\u0027t want to know what they were made of. He drew a short, red-handled knife from the jumble on the bed and advanced towards the goat-\\n\\n A pillow hit him on the back of the head.\\n\\n \u0027Garn! Pious little bastard!\u0027\\n\\n Arthur dropped the knife and burst into tears. Chidder sat up in bed.\\n\\n \u0027That was you, Cheesewright!\u0027 he said. \u0027I saw you!\u0027 Cheesewright, a skinny young man with red hair and a face that was one large freckle, glared at him.\\n\\n \u0027Well, it\u0027s too much,\u0027 he said. \u0027A fellow can\u0027t sleep with all this religion going on. I mean, only little kids say their prayers at bedtime these days, we\u0027re supposed to be learning to be assassins-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You can jolly well shut up, Cheesewright,\u0027 shouted Chidder. \u0027It\u0027d be a better world if more people said their prayers, you know. I know I don\u0027t say mine as often as I should-\u0027\\n\\n A pillow cut him off in mid-sentence. He bounded out of bed and vaulted at the red-haired boy, fists flailing.\\n\\n As the rest of the dormitory gathered around the scuffling pair Teppic slid out of bed and padded over to Arthur, who was sitting on the edge of his bed and sobbing.\\n\\n He patted him uncertainly on the shoulder, on the basis that this sort of thing was supposed to reassure people.\\n\\n \u0027I shouldn\u0027t cry about it, youngster,\u0027 he said, gruffly.\\n\\n \u0027But - but all the runes have been scuffed,\u0027 said Arthur. \u0027It\u0027s all too late now! And that means the Great Om will come in the night and wind out my entrails on a stick!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Does it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And suck out my eyes, my mother said!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Gosh!\u0027 said Teppic, fascinated. \u0027Really?\u0027 He was quite glad his bed was opposite Arthur\u0027s, and would offer an unrivalled view. \u0027What religion would this be?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027re Strict Authorised Ormits,\u0027 said Arthur. He blew his nose. \u0027I noticed you don\u0027t pray,\u0027 he said. \u0027Don\u0027t you have a god?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh yes,\u0027 said Teppic hesitantly, \u0027no doubt about that.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You don\u0027t seem to want to talk to him.\u0027\\n\\n Teppic shook his head. \u0027I can\u0027t,\u0027 he said, \u0027not here. He wouldn\u0027t be able to hear, you see.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027My god can hear me anywhere,\u0027 said Arthur fervently.\\n\\n \u0027Well, mine has difficulty if you\u0027re on the other side of the room,\u0027 said Teppic. \u0027It can be very embarrassing.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re not an Offlian, are you?\u0027 said Arthur. Offler was a Crocodile God, and lacked ears.\\n\\n \u0027No.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What god do you worship, then?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not exactly worship,\u0027 said Teppic, discomforted. \u0027I wouldn\u0027t say worship. I mean, he\u0027s all right. He\u0027s my father, if you must know.\u0027\\n\\n Arthur\u0027s pink-rimmed eyes widened.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re the son of a god?\u0027 he whispered.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s all part of being a king, where I come from,\u0027 said Teppic hurriedly. \u0027He doesn\u0027t have to do very much. That is, the priests do the actual running of the country. He just makes sure that the river floods every year, d\u0027you see, and services the Great Cow of the Arch of the Sky. Well, used to.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The Great-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027My mother,\u0027 explained Teppic. \u0027It\u0027s all very embarrassing.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Does he smite people?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t think so. He\u0027s never said.\u0027\\n\\n Arthur reached down to the end of the bed. The goat, in the confusion, had chewed through its rope and trotted out of the door, vowing to give up religion in future.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m going to get into awful trouble,\u0027 he said. \u0027I suppose you couldn\u0027t ask your father to explain things to the Great OM?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He might be able to,\u0027 said Teppic doubtfully. \u0027I was going to write home tomorrow anyway.\\n\\n \u0027The Great Orm is normally to be found in one of the Nether Hells,\u0027 said Arthur, \u0027where he watches everything we do. Everything I do, anyway. There\u0027s only me and mother left now, and she doesn\u0027t do much that needs watching.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll be sure and tell him.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Do you think the Great Orm will come tonight?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I shouldn\u0027t think so. I\u0027ll ask my father to be sure and tell him not to.\u0027\\n\\n At the other end of the dormitory Chidder was kneeling on Cheesewright\u0027s back and knocking his head repeatedly against the wall.\\n\\n \u0027Say it again,\u0027 he commanded. \u0027Come on - “There\u0027s nothing wrong-”\u0027\\n\\n \u0027“There\u0027s nothing wrong with a chap being man enough-” curse you, Chidder, you beastly-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I can\u0027t hear you, Cheesewright,\u0027 said Chidder.\\n\\n \u0027“Man enough to say his prayers in front of other chaps”, you rotter.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Right. And don\u0027t you forget it.\u0027 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pyramids-discworld-7/page-4.html","bookId":1626,"book":{"id":1626,"title":"Pyramids (Discworld #7)","description":"Storyline: Pyramids (Discworld #7) \\n It\u0027s bad enough being new on the job, but Teppic hasn\u0027t a clue as to what a pharaoh is supposed to do.
