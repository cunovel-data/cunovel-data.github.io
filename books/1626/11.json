{"id":95675,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"\u0027It must make you feel really proud,\u0027 said Gern.\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, our mam says the king goes on living, sort of thing, after all this stuffing and stitching. Sort of in the Netherworld. With your stitching in him.\u0027\\n\\n And several sacks of straw and a couple of buckets of pitch, thought the shade of the king sadly. And the wrapping off Gern\u0027s lunch, although he didn\u0027t blame the lad, who\u0027d just forgotten where he\u0027d put it. All eternity with someone\u0027s lunch wrapping as part of your vital organs. There had been half a sausage left, too.\\n\\n He\u0027d become quite attached to Dil, and even to Gern. He seemed still to be attached to his body, too - at least, he felt uncomfortable if he wandered more than a few hundred yards away from it - and so in the course of the last couple of days he\u0027d learned quite a lot about them.\\n\\n Funny, really. He\u0027d spent the whole of his life in the kingdom talking to a few priests and so forth. He knew objectively there had been other people around - servants and gardeners and so forth - but they figured in his life as blobs. He was at the top, and then his family, and then the priests and the nobles of course, and then there were the blobs. Damn fine blobs, of course, some of the finest blobs in the world, as loyal a collection of blobs as a king might hope to rule. But blobs, none the less.\\n\\n But now he was absolutely engrossed in the daily details of Dil\u0027s shy hopes for advancement within the Guild, and the unfolding story of Gern\u0027s clumsy overtures to Glwenda, the garlic farmer\u0027s daughter who lived nearby. He listened in fascinated astonishment to the elaboration of a world as full of subtle distinctions of grade and station as the one he had so recently left; it was terrible to think that he might never know if Gern overcame her father\u0027s objections and won his intended, or if Dil\u0027s work on this job - on him - would allow him to aspire to the rank of Exalted Grand Ninety-Degree Variance of the Matron Lodge of the Guild of Embalmers and Allied Trades.\\n\\n It was as if death was some astonishing optical device which turned even a drop of water into a complex hive of life.\\n\\n He found an overpowering urge to counsel Dil on elementary politics, or apprise Gern of the benefits of washing and looking respectable. He tried it several times. They could sense him, there was no doubt about that. But they just put it down to draughts.\\n\\n Now he watched Dil pad over to the big table of bandages, and come back with a thick swatch which he held reflectively against what even the king was now prepared to think of as his corpse.\\n\\n \u0027I think the linen,\u0027 he said at last. \u0027It\u0027s definitely his colour.\u0027\\n\\n Gern put his head on one side.\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027d look good in the hessian,\u0027 he said. \u0027Or maybe the calico.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not the calico. Definitely not the calico. On him it\u0027s too big.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He could moulder into it. With wear, you know.\u0027\\n\\n Dil snorted. \u0027Wear? Wear? You shouldn\u0027t talk to me about calico and wear. What happens if someone robs the tomb in a thousand years\u0027 time and him in calico, I\u0027d like to know. He\u0027d lurch halfway down the corridor, maybe throttle one of them, I\u0027ll grant you, but then he\u0027s coming undone, right? The elbows\u0027ll be out in no time, I\u0027ll never live it down.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But you\u0027ll be dead, master!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Dead? What\u0027s that got to do with it?\u0027 Dil riffled through the samples. \u0027No, it\u0027ll be the hessian. Got plenty of give in it, hessian. Good traction, too. He\u0027ll really be able to lurch up speed in the passages, if he ever needs to.\u0027\\n\\n The king sighed. He\u0027d have preferred something lightweight in taffeta.\\n\\n \u0027And go and shut the door,\u0027 Dil added. \u0027It\u0027s getting breezy in here.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And now it\u0027s time,\u0027 said the high priest, \u0027for us to see our late father.\u0027 He allowed himself a quiet smile. \u0027I am sure he is looking forward to it,\u0027 he added.\\n\\n Teppic considered this. It wasn\u0027t something he was looking forward to, but at least it would get everyone\u0027s mind off him marrying relatives. He reached down in what he hoped was a kingly fashion to stroke one of the palace cats. This also was not a good move. The creature sniffed it, went cross-eyed with the effort of thought, and then bit his fingers.\\n\\n \u0027Cats are sacred,\u0027 said Dios, shocked at the words Teppic uttered.\\n\\n \u0027Long-legged cats with silver fur and disdainful expressions are, maybe,\u0027 said Teppic, nursing his hand, \u0027I don\u0027t know about this sort. I\u0027m sure sacred cats don\u0027t leave dead ibises under the bed. And I\u0027m certain that sacred cats that live surrounded by endless sand don\u0027t come indoors and do it in the king\u0027s sandals, Dios.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All cats are cats,\u0027 said Dios, vaguely, and added, \u0027If we would be so gracious as to follow us.\u0027 He motioned Teppic towards a distant arch.\\n\\n Teppic followed slowly. He\u0027d been back home for what seemed like ages, and it still didn\u0027t feel right. The air was too dry. The clothes felt wrong. It was too hot. Even the buildings seemed wrong. The pillars, for one thing. Back home, back at the Guild, pillars were gracefull fluted things with little bunches of stone grapes and things around the top. Here they were massive pear-shaped lumps, where all the stone had run to the bottom.\\n\\n Half a dozen servants trailed behind him, carrying the various items of regalia.\\n\\n He tried to imitate Dios\u0027s walk, and found the movements coming back to him. You turned your torso this way, then you turned your head this way, and extended your arms at forty-five degrees to your body with the palms down, and then you attempted to move.\\n\\n The high priest\u0027s staff raised echoes as it touched the flagstones. A blind man could have walked barefoot through the palace by tracing the time-worn dimples it had created over the years.\\n\\n \u0027I am afraid that we will find that our father has changed somewhat since we last saw him,\u0027 said Dios conversationally, as they undulated by the fresco of Queen Khaphut accepting Tribute from the Kingdoms of the World.\\n\\n \u0027Well, yes,\u0027 said Teppic, bewildered by the tone. \u0027He\u0027s dead, isn\u0027t he?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s that, too,\u0027 said Dios, and Teppic realised that he hadn\u0027t been referring to something as trivial as the king\u0027s current physical condition.\\n\\n He was lost in a horrified admiration. It wasn\u0027t that Dios was particularly cruel or uncaring, it was simply that death was a mere irritating transition in the eternal business of existence. The fact that people died was just an inconvenience, like them being out when you called.\\n\\n It\u0027s a strange world, he thought. It\u0027s all busy shadows, and it never changes. And I\u0027m part of it.\\n\\n \u0027Who\u0027s he?\u0027 he said, pointing to a particularly big fresco showing a tall man with a hat like a chimney and a beard like a rope riding a chariot over a lot of other, much smaller, people.\\n\\n \u0027His name is in the cartouche below,\u0027 said Dios primly.\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The small oval, sire,\u0027 said Dios.\\n\\n Teppic peered closely at the dense hieroglyphics.\\n\\n \u0027“Thin eagle, eye, wiggly line, man with a stick, bird sitting down, wiggly line”,\u0027 he read. Dios winced.\\n\\n \u0027I believe we must apply ourselves more to the study of modem languages,\u0027 he said, recovering a bit. \u0027His name is Pta-ka-ba. He is king when the Djel Empire extends from the Circle Sea to the Rim Ocean, when almost half the continent pays tribute to us.\u0027\\n\\n Teppic realised what it was about the man\u0027s speech that was strange. Dios would bend any sentence to breaking point if it meant avoiding a past tense. He pointed to another fresco.\\n\\n \u0027And her?\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027She is Queen Khat-leon-ra-pta,\u0027 said Dios. \u0027She wins the kingdom of Howandaland by stealth. This is the time of the Second Empire.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But she is dead?\u0027 said Teppic.\\n\\n \u0027I understand so,\u0027 said the high priest, after the slightest of pauses. Yes. The past tense definitely bothered Dios.\\n\\n \u0027I have learned seven languages,\u0027 said Teppic, secure in the knowledge that the actual marks he had achieved in three of them would remain concealed in the ledgers of the Guild.\\n\\n \u0027Indeed, sire?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, yes. Morporkian, Vanglemesht, Ephebe, Laotation and several others . . .\u0027 said Teppic.\\n\\n \u0027Ah.\u0027 Dios nodded, smiled, and continued to proceed down the corridor, limping slightly but still measuring his pace like the ticking of centuries. \u0027The barbarian lands.\u0027\\n\\n Teppic looked at his father. The embalmers had done a good job. They were waiting for him to tell them so.\\n\\n Part of him, which still lived in Ankh-Morpork, said: this is a dead body, wrapped up in bandages, surely they can\u0027t think that this will help him get better? In Ankh, you die and they bury you or burn you or throw you to the ravens. Here, it just means you slow down a bit and get given all the best food. It\u0027s ridiculous, how can you run a kingdom like this? They seem to think that being dead is like being deaf, you just have to speak up a bit.\\n\\n But a second, older voice said: We\u0027ve run a kingdom like this for seven thousand years. The humblest melon farmer has a lineage that makes kings elsewhere look like mayflies. We used to own the continent, before we sold it again to pay for pyramids. We don\u0027t even think about other countries less than three thousand years old. It all seems to work.\\n\\n \u0027Hallo, father,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n The shade of Teppicymon XXVII, which had been watching him closely, hurried across the room.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re looking well!\u0027 he said. \u0027Good to see you! Look, this is urgent. Please pay attention, it\u0027s about death-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He says he is pleased to see you,\u0027 said Dios.\\n\\n \u0027You can hear him?\u0027 said Teppic. \u0027I didn\u0027t hear anything.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The dead, naturally, speak through the priests,\u0027 said the priest. \u0027That is the custom, sire.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But he can hear me, can he?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Of course.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve been thinking about this whole pyramid business and, look, I\u0027m not certain about it.\u0027\\n\\n Teppic leaned closer. \u0027Auntie sends her love,\u0027 he said loudly. He thought about this. \u0027That\u0027s my aunt, not yours.\u0027 I hope, he added.\\n\\n \u0027I say? I say? Can you hear me?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He bids you greetings from the world beyond the veil,\u0027 said Dios.\\n\\n \u0027Well, yes, I suppose I do, but LOOK, I don\u0027t want you to go to a lot of trouble and build-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027re going to build you a marvellous pyramid, father. You\u0027ll really like it there. There\u0027ll be people to look after you and everything.\u0027 Teppic glanced at Dios for reassurance. \u0027He\u0027ll like that, won\u0027t he?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t WANT one!\u0027 screamed the king. \u0027There\u0027s a whole interesting eternity I haven\u0027t seen yet. I forbid you to put me in a pyramid!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He says that is very proper, and you are a dutiful son,\u0027 said Dios.\\n\\n \u0027Can you see me? How many fingers am I holding up? Think it\u0027s fun, do you, spending the rest of your death under a million tons of rock, watching yourself crumble to bits? Is that your idea of a good epoch?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s rather draughty in here, sire,\u0027 said Dios. \u0027Perhaps we should get on.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Anyway, you can\u0027t possibly afford it!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And we\u0027ll put your favourite frescoes and statues in with you. You\u0027ll like that, won\u0027t you,\u0027 said Teppic desperately.\\n\\n \u0027All your bits and pieces around you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He will like it, won\u0027t be?\u0027 he asked Dios, as they walked back to the throne room. \u0027Only, I don\u0027t know, I somehow got a feeling he isn\u0027t too happy about it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I assure you, sire,\u0027 said Dios, \u0027he can have no other desire.\u0027\\n\\n Back in the embalming room King Teppicymon XXVII tried to tap Gern on the shoulder, which had no effect. He gave up and sat down beside himself.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t do it, lad,\u0027 he said bitterly. \u0027Never have descendants.\u0027\\n\\n And then there was the Great Pyramid itself.\\n\\n Teppic\u0027s footsteps echoed on the marble tiles as he walked around the model. He wasn\u0027t sure what one was supposed to do here. But kings, he suspected, were often put in that position; there was always the good old fallback, which was known as taking an interest.\\n\\n \u0027Well, well,\u0027 he said. \u0027How long have you been designing pyramids?\u0027\\n\\n Ptaclusp, architect and jobbing pyramid builder to the nobility, bowed deeply. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pyramids-discworld-7/page-11.html","bookId":1626,"book":{"id":1626,"title":"Pyramids (Discworld #7)","description":"Storyline: Pyramids (Discworld #7) \\n It\u0027s bad enough being new on the job, but Teppic hasn\u0027t a clue as to what a pharaoh is supposed to do.
