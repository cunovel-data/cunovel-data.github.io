Apparently pipes are the thing.\u0027\n \u0027For the asses\u0027 milk?\u0027 said Koomi, who was now totally lost in the desert.[32]\n \u0027Shut up, Koomi.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, O queen,\u0027 said Koomi, miserably.\n He\u0027d wanted changes. It was just that he\u0027d wanted things to stay the same, as well.\n The sun dropped to the horizon, entirely unaided. For some people, it was turning out to be quite a good day. The reddened light lit up the three male members of the Ptaclusp dynasty, as they pored over plans for-\n \u0027It\u0027s called a bridge,\u0027 said IIb.\n \u0027Is that like an aqueduct?\u0027 said Ptaclusp.\n \u0027In reverse, sort of thing,\u0027 said IIb. \u0027The water goes underneath, we go over the top.\u0027\n \u0027Oh. The k- the queen won\u0027t like that,\u0027 said Ptaclusp.\n \u0027The royal family\u0027s always been against chaining the holy river with dams and weirs and suchlike.\u0027\n IIb gave a triumphant grin. \u0027She suggested it,\u0027 he said. \u0027And she graciously went on to say, could we see to it there\u0027s places for people to stand and drop rocks on the crocodiles.\u0027\n \u0027She said that?\u0027\n \u0027Large pointy rocks, she said.\u0027\n \u0027My word,\u0027 said Ptaclusp. He turned to his other son.\n \u0027You sure you\u0027re all right?\u0027 he said.\n \u0027Feeling fine, dad,\u0027 said IIa.\n \u0027No-\u0027 Ptaclusp groped \u0027headaches or anything?\u0027\n \u0027Never felt better,\u0027 said IIa.\n \u0027Only you haven\u0027t asked about the cost,\u0027 said Ptaclusp. \u0027I thought perhaps you were still feeling fl- ill.\u0027\n \u0027The queen has been pleased to ask me to have a look at the royal finances,\u0027 said IIa. \u0027She said priests can\u0027t add up.\u0027 His recent experiences had left him with no ill effects other than a profitable tendency to think at right angles to everyone else, and he sat wreathed in smiles while his mind constructed tariff rates, docking fees and a complex system of value added tax which would shortly give the merchant venturers of Ankh-Morpork a nasty shock.\n Ptaclusp thought about all the miles of the virgin Djel, totally unbridged. And there was plenty of dressed stone around now, millions of tons of the stuff. And you never knew, perhaps on some of those bridges there\u0027d be room for a statue or two. He had the very thing.\n He put his arms around his sons\u0027 shoulders.\n \u0027Lads,\u0027 he said proudly. \u0027It\u0027s looking really quantum.\u0027\n The setting sun also shone on Dil and Gern, although in this case it was by a roundabout route through the lightwell of the palace kitchens. They\u0027d ended up there for no very obvious reason. It was just that it was so depressing in the embalming room, all alone.\n The kitchen staff worked around them, recognising the air of impenetrable gloom that surrounded the two embalmers. It was never a very sociable job at the best of times and embalmers didn\u0027t make friends easily. Anyway, there was a coronation feast to prepare.\n They sat amid the bustle, observing the future over a jug of beer.\n \u0027I expect,\u0027 said Gern, \u0027that Gwlenda can have a word with her dad.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s it, boy,\u0027 said Dil wearily. \u0027There\u0027s a future there. People will always want garlic.\u0027\n \u0027Bloody boring stuff, garlic,\u0027 said Gern, with unusual ferocity. \u0027And you don\u0027t get to meet people. That\u0027s what I liked about our job. Always new faces.\u0027\n \u0027No more pyramids,\u0027 said Dil, without rancour. \u0027That\u0027s what she said. You\u0027ve done a good job, Master Dil, she said, but I\u0027m going to drag this country kicking and screaming into the Century of the Fruitbat.\u0027\n \u0027Cobra,\u0027 said Gern.\n \u0027What?\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s the Century of the Cobra. Not the Fruitbat.\u0027\n \u0027Whatever,\u0027 said Dil irritably. He stared miserably into his mug. That was the trouble now, he reflected. You had to start remembering what century it was.\n He glared at a tray of canapes. That was the thing these days. Everyone fiddling about .\n He picked up an olive and turned it over and over in his fingers.\n \u0027Can\u0027t say I\u0027d feel the same about the old job, mind,\u0027 said Gern, draining the jug, \u0027but I bet you were proud, master - Dil, I mean. You know, when all your stitching held up like that.\u0027\n Dil, his eyes not leaving the olive, reached dreamily down to his belt and grasped one of his smaller knives for intricate jobs.\n \u0027I said, you must have felt very sorry it was all over,\u0027 said Gern.\n Dil swivelled around to get more light, and breathed heavily as he concentrated.\n \u0027Still, you\u0027ll get over it,\u0027 said Gern. \u0027The important thing is not to let it prey on your mind-\u0027\n \u0027Put this stone somewhere,\u0027 said Dil.\n \u0027Sorry?\u0027\n \u0027Put this stone somewhere,\u0027 said Dil.\n Gern shrugged, and took it out of his fingers.\n \u0027Right,\u0027 said Dil, his voice suddenly vibrant with purpose.\n \u0027Now pass me a piece of red pepper .\n And the sun shone on the delta, that little infinity of reed beds and mud banks where the Djel was laying down the silt of the continent. Wading birds bobbed for food in the green maze of stems, and billions of zig-zag midges danced over the brackish water. Here at least time had always passed, as the delta breathed twice daily the cold, fresh water of the tide.\n It was coming in now, the foam-crested cusp of it trickling between the reeds.\n Here and there soaked and ancient bandages unwound, wriggled for a while like incredibly old snakes and then, with the mininum of fuss, dissolved.\n THIS IS MOST IRREGULAR.\n We \u0027re sorry. It\u0027s not our fault.\n HOW MANY OF YOU ARE THERE?\n More than 1,300, I\u0027m afraid.\n VERY WELL, THEN. PLEASE FORM AN ORDERLY QUEUE.\n You Bastard was regarding his empty hay rack.\n It represented a sub-array in the general cluster \u0027hay\u0027, containing arbitrary values between zero and K.\n It didn\u0027t have any hay in it. It might in fact have a negative value of hay in it, but to the hungry stomach the difference between no hay and minus-hay was not of particular interest.\n It didn\u0027t matter how he worked it out, the answer was always the same. It was an equation of classical simplicity. It had a certain clean elegance which he was not, currently, in a position to admire.\n You Bastard felt ill-used and hard done by. There was nothing particularly unusual about this, however, since that is the normal state of mind for a camel. He knelt patiently while Teppic packed the saddlebags.\n \u0027We\u0027ll avoid Ephebe,\u0027 Teppic said, ostensibly to the camel. \u0027We\u0027ll go up the end of the Circle Sea, perhaps to Quirm or over the Ramtops. There\u0027s all sorts of places. Maybe we\u0027ll even look for a few of those cities, eh? I expect you\u0027d like that.\u0027\n It\u0027s a mistake trying to cheer up camels. You may as well drop meringues into a black hole.\n The door at the far end of the stable swung open. It was a priest. He looked rather flustered. The priests had been doing a lot of unaccustomed running around today.\n \u0027Er,\u0027 he began. \u0027Her majesty commands you not to leave the kingdom.\u0027\n He coughed.\n He said, \u0027Is there a reply?\u0027\n Teppic considered. \u0027No,\u0027 he said, \u0027I don\u0027t think so.\u0027\n \u0027So I shall tell her that you will be attending on her presently, shall I?\u0027 said the priest hopefully.\n \u0027No.\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s all very well for you to say,\u0027 said the priest sourly, and slunk off.\n He was replaced a few minutes later by Koomi, very red in the face.\n \u0027Her majesty requests that you do not leave the kingdom,\u0027 he said.\n Teppic climbed on to You Bastard\u0027s back, and tapped the camel lightly, with a prod.\n \u0027She really means it,\u0027 said Koomi.\n \u0027I\u0027m sure she does.\u0027\n \u0027She could have you thrown to the sacred crocodiles, you know.\u0027\n \u0027I haven\u0027t seen many of them around today. How are they?\u0027 said Teppic, and gave the camel another thump.\n He rode out into the knife-edged daylight and along the packed-earth streets, which time had turned into a surface harder than stone. They were thronged with people. And every single person ignored him.\n It was a marvellous feeling.\n He rode gently along the road to the border and did not stop until he was up in the escarpment, the valley spreading out behind him. A hot wind off the desert rattled the syphacia bushes as he tethered You Bastard in the shade, climbed a little further up the rocks, and looked back.\n The valley was old, so old that you could believe it had existed first and had watched the rest of the world form around it. Teppic lay with his head on his arms.\n Of course, it had made itself old. It had been gently stripping itself of futures for thousands of years. Now change was hitting it like the ground hitting an egg.\n Dimensions were probably more complicated than people thought. Probably so was time. Probably so were people, although people could be more predictable.\n He watched the column of dust rise outside the palace and work its way through the city, across the narrow patchwork of fields, disappear for a minute in a group of palm trees near the escarpment, and reappear at the foot of the slope. Long before he could see it he knew there\u0027d be a chariot somewhere in the cloud of sand.\n He slid back down the rocks and squatted patiently by the roadside. The chariot rattled by eventually, halted some way on, turned awkwardly in the narrow space, and trundled back.\n \u0027What will you do?\u0027 shouted Ptraci, leaning over the rail.\n Teppic bowed.\n \u0027And none of that,\u0027 she snapped.\n \u0027Don\u0027t you like being king?\u0027\n She hesitated. \u0027Yes,\u0027 she said. \u0027I do-\u0027\n \u0027Of course you do,\u0027 said Teppic. \u0027It\u0027s in the blood. In the old days people would fight like tigers. Brothers against sisters, cousins against uncles. Dreadful.\u0027\n \u0027But you don\u0027t have to go! I need you!\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027ve got advisers,\u0027 said Teppic mildly.\n \u0027I didn\u0027t mean that,\u0027 she snapped. \u0027Anyway, there\u0027s only Koomi, and he\u0027s no good.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re lucky. I had Dios, and he was good. Koomi will be much better, you can learn a lot by not listening to what he has to say. You can go a long way with incompetent advisers. Besides, Chidder will help, I\u0027m sure. He\u0027s full of ideas.\u0027\n She coloured. \u0027He advanced a few when we were on the ship.\u0027\n \u0027There you are, then. I knew the two of you would get along like a house on fire.\u0027 Screams, flames, people running for safety .\n \u0027And you\u0027re going back to be an Assassin, are you?\u0027 she sneered.\n \u0027I don\u0027t think so. I\u0027ve inhumed a pyramid, a pantheon and the entire old kingdom. It may be worth trying something else. By the way, you haven\u0027t been finding little green shoots springing up wherever you walk, have you?\u0027\n \u0027No. What a stupid idea.\u0027\n Teppic relaxed. It really was all over, then. \u0027Don\u0027t let the grass grow under your feet, that\u0027s the important thing,\u0027 he said. \u0027And you haven\u0027t seen any seagulls around?\u0027\n \u0027There\u0027s lots of them today, or didn\u0027t you notice?\u0027\n \u0027Yes. That\u0027s good, I think.\u0027\n You Bastard watched them talk a little more, that peculiar trailing-off, desultory kind of conversation that two people of opposite sexes engage in when they have something else on their minds. It was much easier with camels, when the female merely had to check the male\u0027s methodology.\n Then they kissed in a fairly chaste fashion, insofar as camels are any judge. A decision was reached.\n You Bastard lost interest at this point, and decided to eat his lunch again.\n IN THE BEGINNING...\n It was peaceful in the valley. The river, its banks as yet untamed, wandered languidly through thickets of rush and papyrus. Ibises waded in the shallows; in the deeps, hippos rose and sank slowly, like pickled eggs.\n The only sound in the damp silence was the occasional plop of a fish or hiss of a crocodile.\n Dios lay in the mud for some time. He wasn\u0027t sure how he\u0027d got there, or why half his robes were torn off and the other half scorched black. He dimly recalled a loud noise and a sensation of extreme speed while, at the same time, he\u0027d been standing still. Right at this moment, he didn\u0027t want any answers. Answers implied questions, and questions never got anyone anywhere. Questions only spoiled things. The mud was cool and soothing, and he didn\u0027t need to know anything else for a while. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pyramids-discworld-7/page-41.html","bookId":1626,"book":{"id":1626,"title":"Pyramids (Discworld #7)","description":"Storyline: \n Pyramids (Discworld #7) \n It\u0027s bad enough being new on the job, but Teppic hasn\u0027t a clue as to what a pharaoh is supposed to do.
