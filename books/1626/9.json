{"id":95673,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"\u0027I took the liberty of attending to that myself, O Dios,\u0027 he purred.\n Dios tapped his fingers on his staff. \u0027Yes,\u0027 he said, \u0027I have no doubt that you did.\u0027\n It was widely expected by the priesthood that Koomi would be the one to succeed Dios in the event of Dios ever actually dying, although hanging around waiting for Dios to die had never seemed to be a rewarding occupation. The only dissenting opinion was that of Dios himself, who, if he had any friends, would probably have confided in them certain conditions that would need to apply first, viz., blue moons, aerial pigs and he, Dios, being seen in Hell. He would probably have added that the only difference between Koomi and a sacred crocodile was the crocodile\u0027s basic honesty of purpose.\n \u0027Very well,\u0027 he said.\n \u0027If I may remind your lordship?\u0027 said Koomi. The faces of the other priests went a nice safe blank as Dios glared.\n \u0027Yes, Koomi?\u0027\n \u0027The prince, O Dios. Has he been summoned?\u0027\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Dios.\n \u0027Then how will he know?\u0027 said Koomi.\n \u0027He will know,\u0027 said Dios firmly.\n \u0027How will this be?\u0027\n \u0027He will know. And now you are all dismissed. Go away. See to your gods!\u0027\n They scurried out, leaving Dios alone on the steps. It had been his accustomed position for so long that he\u0027d polished a groove in the stonework, into which he fitted exactly.\n Of course the prince would know. It was part of the neatness of things. But in the grooves of his mind, ground deep by the years of ritual and due observance, Dios detected a certain uneasiness. It was not at home in there. Uneasiness was something that happened to other people. He hadn\u0027t got where he was today by allowing room for doubt. Yet there was a tiny thought back there, a tiny certainty, that there was going to be trouble with this new king.\n Well. The boy would soon learn. They all learned.\n He shifted position, and winced. The aches and pains were back, and he couldn\u0027t allow that. They got in the way of his duty, and his duty was a sacred trust.\n He\u0027d have to visit the necropolis again. Tonight.\n \u0027He\u0027s not himself, you can see that.\u0027\n \u0027Who is he, then?\u0027 said Chidder.\n They splashed unsteadily down the street, not drunkenly this time, but with the awkward gait of two people trying to do the steering for three. Teppic was walking, but not in a way that gave them any confidence that his mind was having any part of it.\n Around them doors were being thrown open, curses were being cursed, there was the sound of furniture being dragged up to first-floor rooms.\n \u0027Must have been a hell of a storm up in the mountains,\u0027 said Arthur. \u0027It doesn\u0027t usually flood like this even in the spring.\u0027\n \u0027Maybe we should burn some feathers under his nose,\u0027 suggested Chidder.\n \u0027That bloody seagull would be favourite,\u0027 Arthur growled.\n \u0027What seagull?\u0027\n \u0027You saw it.\u0027\n \u0027Well, what about it?\u0027\n \u0027You did see it, didn\u0027t you?\u0027 Uncertainty flickered its dark flame in Arthur\u0027s eyes. The seagull had disappeared in all the excitement.\n \u0027My attention was a bit occupied,\u0027 said Chidder diffidently. \u0027It must have been those mint wafers they served with the coffee. I thought they were a bit off.\u0027\n \u0027Definitely a touch eldritch, that bird,\u0027 said Arthur. \u0027Look, let\u0027s put him down somewhere while I empty the water out of my boots, can we?\u0027\n There was a bakery nearby, its doors thrown open so that the trays of new loaves could cool in the early morning. They propped Teppic against the wall.\n \u0027He looks as though someone hit him on the head,\u0027 said Chidder. \u0027No-one did, did they?\u0027\n Arthur shook his head. Teppic\u0027s face was locked in a gentle grin. Whatever his eyes were focused on wasn\u0027t occupying the usual set of dimensions.\n \u0027We ought to get him back to the Guild and into the san-\u0027 He stopped. There was a peculiar rustling sound behind him. The loaves of bread were bouncing gently on their trays. One or two of them vibrated on to the floor, where they spun around like overturned beetles.\n Then, their crusts cracking open like eggshells, they sprouted hundreds of green shoots.\n Within a few seconds the trays were waving stands of young corn, their heads already beginning to fill out and bend over. Through them marched Chidder and Arthur, poker-faced, doing the 100-metre nonchalant walk with Teppic held rigidly between them.\n \u0027Is it him doing all this?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ve got a feeling that-\u0027 Arthur looked behind them, just in case any angry bakers had come out and spotted such aggressively wholemeal produce, and stopped so suddenly that the other two swung around him, like a rudder.\n They looked thoughtfully at the street.\n \u0027Not something you see every day, that,\u0027 said Chidder at last.\n \u0027You mean the way there\u0027s grass and stuff growing up everywhere he puts his feet?\u0027\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\n Their eyes met. As one, they looked down at Teppic\u0027s shoes. He was already ankle-deep in greenery, which was cracking the centuries-old cobbles in its urgency.\n Without speaking a word, they gripped his elbows and lifted him into the air.\n \u0027The san,\u0027 said Arthur.\n \u0027The san,\u0027 agreed Chidder.\n But they both knew, even then, that this was going to involve more than a hot poultice.\n The doctor sat back.\n \u0027Fairly straightforward,\u0027 he said, thinking quickly. \u0027A case of mortis portalis tackulatum with complications.\u0027\n \u0027What\u0027s that mean?\u0027 said Chidder.\n \u0027In layman\u0027s terms,\u0027 the doctor sniffed, \u0027he\u0027s as dead as a doornail.\u0027\n \u0027What are the complications?\u0027\n The doctor looked shifty. \u0027He\u0027s still breathing,\u0027 he said. \u0027Look, his pulse is nearly humming and he\u0027s got a temperature you could fry eggs on.\u0027 He hesitated, aware that this was probably too straightforward and easily understood; medicine was a new art on the Disc, and wasn\u0027t going to get anywhere if people could understand it.\n \u0027Pyrocerebrum ouerf culinaire,\u0027 he said, after working it out in his head.\n \u0027Well, what can you do about it?\u0027 said Arthur.\n \u0027Nothing. He\u0027s dead. All the medical tests prove it. So, er . . . bury him, keep him nice and cool, and tell him to come and see me next week. In daylight, for preference.\u0027\n \u0027But he\u0027s still breathing!\u0027\n \u0027These are just reflex actions that might easily confuse the layman,\u0027 said the doctor airily.\n Chidder sighed. He suspected that the Guild, who after all had an unrivalled experience of sharp knives and complex organic compounds, was much better at elementary diagnostics than were the doctors. The Guild might kill people, but at least it didn\u0027t expect them to be grateful for it.\n Teppic opened his eyes.\n \u0027I must go home,\u0027 he said.\n \u0027Dead, is he?\u0027 said Chidder.\n The doctor was a credit to his profession. \u0027It\u0027s not unusual for a corpse to make distressing noises after death,\u0027 he said valiantly, \u0027which can upset relatives and-\u0027\n Teppic sat bolt upright.\n \u0027Also, muscular spasms in the stiffening body can in certain circumstances-\u0027 the doctor began, but his heart wasn\u0027t in it any more. Then an idea occurred to him.\n \u0027It\u0027s a rare and mysterious ailment,\u0027 he said, \u0027which is going around a lot at the moment. It\u0027s caused by a - a - by some- thing so small it can\u0027t be detected in any way whatsoever,\u0027 he finished, with a self-congratulatory smile on his face. It was a good one, he had to admit. He\u0027d have to remember it.\n \u0027Thank you very much,\u0027 said Chidder, opening the door and ushering him through. \u0027Next time we\u0027re feeling really well, we\u0027ll definitely call you in.\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s probably a walrus,\u0027 said the doctor, as he was gently but firmly propelled out of the room. \u0027He\u0027s caught a walrus, there\u0027s a lot of it going-\u0027\n The door slammed shut.\n Teppic swung his legs off the bed and clutched at his head.\n \u0027I\u0027ve got to go home,\u0027 he repeated.\n \u0027Why?\u0027 said Arthur.\n \u0027Don\u0027t know. The kingdom wants me.\u0027\n \u0027You seemed to be taken pretty bad there-\u0027 Arthur began. Teppic waved his hands dismissively.\n \u0027Look,\u0027 he said, \u0027please, I don\u0027t want anyone sensibly pointing out things. I don\u0027t want anyone telling me I should rest. None of it matters. I will be back in the kingdom as soon as possible. It\u0027s not a case of must, you understand. I will. And you can help me, Chiddy.\u0027\n \u0027How?\u0027\n \u0027Your father has an extremely fast vessel he uses for smuggling,\u0027 said Teppic flatly. \u0027He will lend it to me, in exchange for favourable consideration of future trading opportunities. If we leave inside the hour, it will do the journey in plenty of time.\u0027\n \u0027My father is an honest trader!\u0027\n \u0027On the contrary. Seventy per cent of his income last year was from undeclared trading in the following commodities-\u0027 Teppic\u0027s eyes stared into nothingness - \u0027From illegal transport of gullanes and leuchars, nine per cent. From night-running of untaxed-\u0027\n \u0027Well, thirty per cent honest,\u0027 Chidder admitted, \u0027which is a lot more honest than most. You\u0027d better tell me how you know. Extremely quickly.\u0027\n \u0027I - don\u0027t know,\u0027 said Teppic. \u0027When I was . . . asleep, it seemed I knew everything. Everything about everything. I think my father is dead.\u0027\n \u0027Oh,\u0027 said Chidder. \u0027Gosh, I\u0027m sorry.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, no. It\u0027s not like that. It\u0027s what he would have wanted. I think he was rather looking forward to it. In our family, death is when you really start to, you know, enjoy life. I expect he\u0027s rather enjoying it.\u0027\n In fact the pharaoh was sitting on a spare slab in the ceremonial preparation room watching his own soft bits being carefully removed from his body and put into the special Canopic jars.\n This is not a sight often seen by people - at least, not by people in a position to take a thoughtful interest.\n He was rather upset. Although he was no longer officially inhabiting his body he was still attached to it by some sort of occult bond, and it is hard to be very happy at seeing two artisans up to the elbows in bits of you.\n The jokes aren\u0027t funny, either. Not when you are, as it were, the butt.\n \u0027Look, master Dil,\u0027 said Gern, a plump, red-faced young man who the king had learned was the new apprentice. uk... hght... watch this, watch this.. . hgk.. your name in lights. Get it? Your name in lights, see?\u0027\n \u0027Just put them in the jar, boy,\u0027 said Dil wearily. \u0027And while we\u0027re on the subject I didn\u0027t think much of the Gottle of Geer routine, either.\u0027\n \u0027Sorry, master.\u0027\n \u0027And pass me over a number three brain hook while you\u0027re up that end, will you?\u0027\n \u0027Coming right up, master,\u0027 said Gern.\n \u0027And don\u0027t jog me. This is a fiddly bit.\u0027\n \u0027Sure thing.\u0027\n The king craned nearer.\n Gern rummaged around at his end of the job and then gave a long, low whistle.\n \u0027Will you look at the colour of this!\u0027 he said. \u0027You wouldn\u0027t think so, would you? Is it something they eat, master?\u0027\n Dil sighed. \u0027Just put it in the pot, Gern.\u0027\n \u0027Right you are, master. Master?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, lad?\u0027\n \u0027Which bit\u0027s got the god in it, master?\u0027\n Dil squinted up the king\u0027s nostril, trying to concentrate. \u0027That gets sorted out before he comes down here,\u0027 he said patiently.\n \u0027I wondered,\u0027 said Gern, \u0027because there\u0027s not a jar for it, see.\u0027\n \u0027No. There wouldn\u0027t be. It\u0027d have to be a rather strange jar, Gern.\u0027\n Gern looked a bit disappointed. \u0027Oh,\u0027 he said, \u0027so he\u0027s just ordinary, then, is he?\u0027\n \u0027In a strictly organic sense,\u0027 said Dil, his voice slightly muffled.\n \u0027Our mum said he was all right as a king,\u0027 said Gern. \u0027What do you think?\u0027\n Dil paused with a jar in his hand, and seemed to give the conversation some thought for the first time.\n \u0027Never think about it until they come down here,\u0027 he said. \u0027I suppose he was better than most. Nice pair of lungs. Clean kidneys. Good big sinuses, which is what I always look for in a king.\u0027 He looked down, and delivered his professional judgement. \u0027Pleasure to work with, really.\u0027\n \u0027Our mum said his heart was in the right place,\u0027 said Gern. The king, hovering dismally in the corner, gave a gloomy nod. Yes, he thought. Jar three, top shelf. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pyramids-discworld-7/page-9.html","bookId":1626,"book":{"id":1626,"title":"Pyramids (Discworld #7)","description":"Storyline: \n Pyramids (Discworld #7) \n It\u0027s bad enough being new on the job, but Teppic hasn\u0027t a clue as to what a pharaoh is supposed to do.
