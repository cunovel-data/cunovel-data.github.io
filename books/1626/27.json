{"id":95691,"no":27,"title":"Page 27","content":"\u0027Don\u0027t see why,\u0027 grumbled an elderly priest at the back of the crowd. \u0027Bloody knife and fork artist.\u0027\\n\\n They grabbed him, still protesting, and hurled him into the river.\\n\\n \u0027All hail-\u0027 They paused. \u0027Who was he high priest of, anyway?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Bunu, the Goat-headed God of Goats? Wasn\u0027t he?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All hail Bunu, probably,\u0027 they chorused, as the sacred crocodiles homed in like submarines.\\n\\n Koomi raised his hands, imploring. It is said that the hour brings forth the man. He was the kind of man that is brought forth by devious and unpleasant hours, and underneath his bald head certain conclusions were beginning to unfold, like things imprisoned for years inside stones. He wasn\u0027t yet sure what they were, but they were broadly on the subject of gods, the new age, the need for a firm hand on the helm, and possibly the inserting of Dios into the nearest crocodile. The mere thought filled him with forbidden delight.\\n\\n \u0027Brethren!\u0027 he cried.\\n\\n \u0027Excuse me,\u0027 said the priestess of Sarduk.\\n\\n \u0027And sistren-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Thank you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027-let us rejoice!\u0027 The assembled priests stood in total silence. This was a radical approach which had not hitherto occurred to them. And Koomi looked at their upturned faces and felt a thrill the like of which he had never experienced before. They were frightened out of their wits, and they were expecting him - him - to tell them what to do.\\n\\n \u0027Yea!\u0027 he said. \u0027And, indeed, verily, the hour of the gods-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027-and goddesses-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027-yes, and goddesses, is at hand. Er.\u0027\\n\\n What next? What, when you got right down to it, was he going to tell them to do? And then he thought: it doesn\u0027t matter. Provided I sound confident enough. Old Dios always drove them, he never tried to lead them. Without him they\u0027re wandering around like sheep.\\n\\n \u0027And, brethren - and sistren, of course - we must ask ourselves, we must ask ourselves, we, er, yes.\u0027 His voice waxed again with new confidence. \u0027Yes, we must ask ourselves why the gods are at hand. And without doubt it is because we have not been assiduous enough in our worship, we have, er, we have lusted after graven idols.\u0027\\n\\n The priests exchanged glances. Had they? How did you do it, actually?\\n\\n \u0027And, yes, and what about sacrifices? Time was when a sacrifice was a sacrifice, not some messing around with a chicken and flowers.\u0027\\n\\n This caused some coughing in the audience.\\n\\n \u0027Are we talking maidens here?\u0027 said one of the priests uncertainly.\\n\\n \u0027Ahem.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And inexperienced young men too, certainly,\u0027 he said quickly. Sarduk was one of the older goddesses, whose female worshippers got up to no good in sacred groves; the thought of her wandering around the landscape somewhere, bloody to the elbows, made the eyes water.\\n\\n Koomi\u0027s heart thumped. \u0027Well, why not?\u0027 he said. \u0027Things were better then, weren\u0027t they?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But, er, I thought we stopped all that sort of thing. Population decline and so forth.\u0027\\n\\n There was a monstrous splash out in the river. Tzut, the Snake-Headed God of the Upper Djel, surfaced and regarded the assembled priesthood solemnly. Then Fhez, the Crocodile-Headed God of the Lower Djel, erupted beside him and made a spirited attempt at biting his head off. The two submerged in a column of spray and a minor tidal wave which slopped over the balcony.\\n\\n \u0027Ah, but maybe the population declined because we stopped sacrificing virgins - of both sexes, of course,\u0027 said Koomi, hurriedly. \u0027Have you ever thought of it like that?\u0027 They thought of it. Then they thought of it again.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t think the king would approve-\u0027 said one of the priests cautiously.\\n\\n \u0027The king?\u0027 shouted Koomi. \u0027Where is the king? Show me the king! Ask Dios where the king is!\u0027\\n\\n There was a thud by his feet. He looked down in horror as the gold mask bounced, and rolled towards the priests. They scattered hurriedly, like skittles.\\n\\n Dios strode out into the light of the disputed sun, his face grey with fury.\\n\\n \u0027The king is dead,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n Koomi swayed under the sheer pressure of anger, but rallied magnificently.\\n\\n \u0027Then his successor-\u0027 he began.\\n\\n \u0027There is no successor,\u0027 said Dios. He stared up at the sky. Few people can look directly at the sun, but under the venom of Dios\u0027s gaze the sun itself might have flinched and looked away. Dios\u0027s eyes sighted down that fearsome nose like twin range finders.\\n\\n To the air in general he said: \u0027Coming here as if they own the place. How dare they?\u0027\\n\\n Koomi\u0027s mouth dropped open. He started to protest, and a kilowatt stare silenced him.\\n\\n Koomi sought support from the crowd of priests, who were busily inspecting their nails or staring intently into the middle distance. The message was clear. He was on his own. Although, if by some chance he won the battle of wills, he\u0027d be surrounded by people assuring him that they had been behind him all along.\\n\\n \u0027Anyway, they do own the place,\u0027 he mumbled.\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They, er, they do own the place, Dios,\u0027 Koomi repeated. His temper gave out. \u0027They\u0027re the sodding gods, Dios!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They\u0027re our gods,\u0027 Dios hissed. \u0027We\u0027re not their people. They\u0027re my gods and they will learn to do as they are instructed!\u0027\\n\\n Koomi gave up the frontal assault. You couldn\u0027t outstare that sapphire stare, you couldn\u0027t stand the war-axe nose and, most of all, no man could be expected to dent the surface of Dios\u0027s terrifying righteousness.\\n\\n \u0027But-\u0027 he managed.\\n\\n Dios waved him into silence with a trembling hand.\\n\\n \u0027They\u0027ve no right! \u0027 he said. \u0027I did not give any orders! They have no right!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then what are you going to do?\u0027 said Koomi.\\n\\n Dios\u0027s hands opened and closed fitfully. He felt like a royalist might feel - a good royalist, a royalist who cut out pictures of all the Royals and stuck them in a scrapbook, a royalist who wouldn\u0027t hear a word said about them, they did such a good job and they can\u0027t answer back - if suddenly all the Royals turned up in his living room and started rearranging the furniture. He longed for the necropolis, and the cool silence among his old friends, and a quick sleep after which he\u0027d be able to think so much more clearly . . .\\n\\n Koomi\u0027s heart leapt. Dios\u0027s discomfort was a crack which, with due care and attention, could take a wedge. But you couldn\u0027t use a hammer. Head on, Dios could outfight the world.\\n\\n The old man was shaking again. \u0027I do not presume to tell them how to run affairs in the Hereunder,\u0027 he said. \u0027They shall not presume to instruct me in how to run my kingdom.\u0027\\n\\n Koomi salted this treasonable statement away for further study and patted him gently on the back.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re right, of course,\u0027 he said. Dios\u0027s eyes swivelled.\\n\\n \u0027I am?\u0027 he said, suspiciously.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m sure that, as the king\u0027s minister, you will find a way. You have our full support, O Dios.\u0027 Koomi waved an uplifted hand at the priests, who chorused wholehearted agreement. If you couldn\u0027t depend on kings and gods, you could always rely on old Dios. There wasn\u0027t one of them that wouldn\u0027t prefer the uncertain wrath of the gods to a rebuke from Dios. Dios terrified them in a very positive, human way that no supernatural entity ever could. Dios would sort it out.\\n\\n \u0027And we take no heed to these mad rumours about the king\u0027s disappearance. They are undoubtedly wild exaggerations, with no foundation,\u0027 said Koomi.\\n\\n The priests nodded while, in each mind, a tiny rumour uncurled the length of its tail.\\n\\n \u0027What rumours?\u0027 said Dios out of the corner of his mouth.\\n\\n \u0027So enlighten us, master, as to the path we must now take,\u0027 said Koomi.\\n\\n Dios wavered.\\n\\n He did not know what to do. For him, this was a new experience. This was Change.\\n\\n All he could think of, all that was pressing forward in his mind, were the words of the Ritual of the Third Hour, which he had said at this time for - how long? Too long, too long! - And he should have gone to his rest long before, but the time had never been right, there was never anyone capable, they would have been lost without him, the kingdom would founder, he would be letting everyone down, and so he\u0027d crossed the river. . . he swore every time that it was the last, but it never was, not when the chill fetched his limbs, and the decades had become - longer. And now, when his kingdom needed him, the words of a Ritual had scored themselves into the pathways of his brain and bewildered all attempts at thought.\\n\\n \u0027Er,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n You Bastard chewed happily. Teppic had tethered him too near an olive tree, which was getting a terminal pruning. Sometimes the camel would stop, gaze up briefly at the seagulls that circled everywhere above Ephebe city, and subject them to a short, deadly burst of olive stones.\\n\\n He was turning over in his mind an interesting new concept in Thau-dimensional physics which unified time, space, magnetism, gravity and, for some reason, broccoli. Periodically he would make noises like distant quarry blasting, but which merely indicated that all stomachs were functioning perfectly.\\n\\n Ptraci sat under the tree, feeding the tortoise on vine leaves.\\n\\n Heat crackled off the white walls of the tavern but, Teppic thought, how different it was from the Old Kingdom. There even the heat was old; the air was musty and lifeless, it pressed like a vice, you felt it was made of boiled centuries. Here it was leavened by the breeze from the sea. It was edged with salt crystals. It carried exciting hints of wine; more than a hint in fact, because Xeno was already on his second amphora. This was the kind of place where things rolled up their sleeves and started.\\n\\n \u0027But I still don\u0027t understand about the tortoise,\u0027 he said, with some difficulty. He\u0027d just taken his first mouthful of Ephebian wine, and it had apparently varnished the back of his throat.\\n\\n \u0027\u0027S quite simple,\u0027 said Xeno. \u0027Look, let\u0027s say this olive stone is the arrow and this, and this-\u0027 he cast around aimlessly - \u0027and this stunned seagull is the tortoise, right? Now, when you fire the arrow it goes from here to the seag - the tortoise, am I right?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I suppose so, but-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But, by this time, the seagu - the tortoise has moved on a bit, hasn\u0027t he? Am I right?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I suppose so,\u0027 said Teppic, helplessly. Xeno gave him a look of triumph.\\n\\n \u0027So the arrow has to go a bit further, doesn\u0027t it, to where the tortoise is now. Meanwhile the tortoise has flow - moved on, not much, I\u0027ll grant you, but it doesn\u0027t have to be much. Am I right? So the arrow has a bit further to go, but the point is that by the time it gets to where the tortoise is now the tortoise isn\u0027t there. So, if the tortoise keeps moving, the arrow will never hit it. It\u0027ll keep getting closer and closer but never hit it. QED.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Are you right?\u0027 said Teppic automatically.\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Ibid coldly. \u0027There\u0027s a dozen tortoise kebabs to prove him wrong. The trouble with my friend here is that he doesn\u0027t know the difference between a postulate and a metaphor of human existence. Or a hole in the ground.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It didn\u0027t hit it yesterday,\u0027 snapped Xeno.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, I was watching. You hardly pulled the string back. I saw you,\u0027 said Ibid.\\n\\n They started to argue again.\\n\\n Teppic stared into his wine mug. These men are philosophers, he thought. They had told him so. So their brains must be so big that they have room for ideas that no-one else would consider for five seconds. On the way to the tavern Xeno had explained to him, for example, why it was logically impossible to fall out of a tree.\\n\\n Teppic had described the vanishing of the kingdom, but he hadn\u0027t revealed his position in it. He hadn\u0027t a lot of experience of these matters, but he had a very clear feeling that kings who hadn\u0027t got a kingdom any more were not likely to be very popular in neighbouring countries. There had been one or two like that in Ankh-Morpork - deposed royalty, who had fled their suddenly-dangerous kingdoms for Ankh\u0027s hospitable bosom carrying nothing but the clothes they stood up in and a few wagonloads of jewels. The city, of course, welcomed anyone - regardless of race, colour, class or creed - who had spending money in incredible amounts, but nevertheless the inhumation of surplus monarchs was a regular source of work for the Assassins\u0027 Guild. There was always someone back home who wanted to be certain that deposed monarchs stayed that way. It was usually a case of heir today, gone tomorrow. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pyramids-discworld-7/page-27.html","bookId":1626,"book":{"id":1626,"title":"Pyramids (Discworld #7)","description":"Storyline: Pyramids (Discworld #7) \\n It\u0027s bad enough being new on the job, but Teppic hasn\u0027t a clue as to what a pharaoh is supposed to do.
