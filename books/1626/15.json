Of course there is a lot more to it than that, but paracosmically that is what it boils down to. Ptaclusp IIb tapped the stone lightly with his staff. The air above it wavered in the heat and then, shedding a little dust, the block rose gently until it bobbed a few feet off the ground, held in check by mooring ropes. That was all there was to it. Teppic had expected some thunder, or at least a gout of flame. But already the workers were clustering around another block, and a couple of men were towing the first block down towards the site. \u0027Very impressive,\u0027 he said sadly. \u0027Indeed, sire,\u0027 said Dios. \u0027And now, we must go back to the palace. It will soon be time for the Ceremony of the Third Hour. \u0027Yes, yes, all right,\u0027 snapped Teppic. \u0027Very well done, Ptaclusp. Keep up the good work.\u0027 Ptaclusp bowed like a seesaw in flustered excitement and confusion. \u0027Very good, your sire,\u0027 he said, and decided to go for the big one. \u0027May I show your sire the latest plans?\u0027 \u0027The king has approved the plans already,\u0027 said Dios. \u0027And, excuse me if I am mistaken, but it seems that the pyramid is well under construction.\u0027 \u0027Yes, yes, but,\u0027 said Ptaclusp, \u0027it occurred to us, this avenue here, you see, overlooking the entrance, what a place, we thought, for a statue of for instance Hat the Vulture-Headed God of Unexpected Guests at practically cost-\u0027 Dios glanced at the sketches. \u0027Are those supposed to be wings?\u0027 he said. \u0027Not even cost, not even cost, tell you what I\u0027ll do-\u0027 said Ptaclusp desperately. \u0027Is that a nose?\u0027 said Dios. \u0027More a beak, more a beak,\u0027 said Ptaclusp. \u0027Look, O priest, how about-\u0027 \u0027I think not,\u0027 said Dios. \u0027No. I really think not.\u0027 He scanned the quarry for Teppic, groaned, thrust the sketches into the builder\u0027s hands and started to run. Teppic had strolled down the path to the waiting chariots, looking wistfully at the bustle around him, and paused to watch a group of workers who were dressing a corner piece. They froze when they felt his gaze on them, and stood sheepishly watching him. \u0027Well well,\u0027 said Teppic, inspecting the stone, although all he knew about stonemasonry could have been chiselled on a sand grain. \u0027What a splendid piece of rock.\u0027 He turned to the nearest man, whose mouth fell open. \u0027You\u0027re a stonemason, are you?\u0027 he said. \u0027That must be a very interesting job.\u0027 The man\u0027s eyes bulged. He dropped his chisel. \u0027Erk,\u0027 he said. A hundred yards away Dios\u0027s robes flapped around his legs as he pounded down the path. He grasped the hem and galloped along, sandals flapping. \u0027What\u0027s your name?\u0027 said Teppic. \u0027Aaaargle,\u0027 said the man, terrified. \u0027Well, jolly good,\u0027 said Teppic, and took his unresisting hand and shook it. \u0027Sire!\u0027 Dios bellowed. \u0027No!\u0027 And the mason spun away, holding his right hand by the wrist, fighting it, screaming . . . Teppic gripped the arms of the throne and glared at the high priest. \u0027But it\u0027s a gesture of fellowship, nothing more. Where I come from-\u0027 \u0027Where you come from, sire, is here!\u0027 thundered Dios. \u0027But, good grief, cutting it off? It\u0027s too cruel!\u0027 Dios stepped forward. Now his voice was back to its normal oil-smooth tones. \u0027Cruel, sire? But it will be done with precision and care, with drugs to take away the pain. He will certainly live. \u0027But why?\u0027 \u0027I did explain, sire. He cannot use the hand again without defiling it. He is a devout man and knows this very well. You see, sire, you are a god, sire.\u0027 \u0027But you can touch me. So can the servants!\u0027 \u0027I am a priest, sire,\u0027 said Dios gently. \u0027And the servants have special dispensation.\u0027 Teppic bit his lip. \u0027This is barbaric,\u0027 he said. Dios\u0027s features did not move. \u0027It will not be done,\u0027 Teppic said. \u0027I am the king. I forbid it to be done, do you understand?\u0027 Dios bowed. Teppic recognised No.49, Horrified Disdain. \u0027Your wish will certainly be done, O fountain of all wisdom. Although, of course, the man himself may take matters into, if you will excuse me, his own hands.\u0027 \u0027What do you mean?\u0027 snapped Teppic. \u0027Sire, if his colleagues had not stopped him he would have done it himself. With a chisel, I understand.\u0027 Teppic stared at him and thought, I am a stranger in a familiar land. \u0027I see,\u0027 he said eventually. He thought a little further. \u0027Then the - operation is to be done with all care, and the man is to be given a pension afterwards, d\u0027you see?\u0027 \u0027As you wish, sire.\u0027 \u0027A proper one, too.\u0027 \u0027Indeed, sire. A golden handshake, sire,\u0027 said Dios impassively. \u0027And perhaps we can find him some light job around the palace?\u0027 \u0027As a one-handed stonemason, sire?\u0027 Dios\u0027s left eyebrow arched a fraction. \u0027As whatever, Dios.\u0027 \u0027Certainly, sire. As you wish. I will undertake to see if we are currently short-handed in any department.\u0027 Teppic glared at him. \u0027I am the king, you know,\u0027 he said sharply. \u0027The fact attends me with every waking hour, sire.\u0027 \u0027Dios?\u0027 said Teppic, as the high priest was leaving. \u0027Sire?\u0027 \u0027I ordered a feather bed from Ankh-Morpork some weeks ago. I suppose you would not know what became of it?\u0027 Dios waved his hands in an expressive gesture. \u0027I gather, sire, that there is considerable pirate activity off the Khalian coast,\u0027 he said. \u0027Doubtless the pirates are also responsible for the non-appearance of the expert from the Guild of Plumbers and Dunnikindivers?\u0027 Teppic said sourly.[15] \u0027Yes, sire. Or possibly bandits, sire.\u0027 \u0027Or perhaps a giant two-headed bird swooped down and carried him off,\u0027 said Teppic. \u0027All things are possible, sire,\u0027 said the high priest, his face radiating politeness. \u0027You may go, Dios.\u0027 \u0027Sire. May I remind you, sire, that the emissaries from Tsort and Ephebe will be attending you at the fifth hour.\u0027 \u0027Yes. You may go.\u0027 Teppic was left alone, or at least as alone as he ever was, which meant that he was all by himself except for two fan wavers, a butler, two enormous Howonder guards by the door, and a couple of handmaidens. Oh, yes. Handmaidens. He hadn\u0027t quite come to terms with the handmaidens yet. Presumably Dios chose them, as he seemed to oversee everything in the palace, and he had shown surprisingly good taste in the matter of, for example, olive skins, bosoms and legs. The clothing these two wore would between them have covered a small saucer. And this was odd, because the net effect was to turn them into two attractive and mobile pieces of furniture, as sexless as pillars. Teppic sighed with the recollection of women in Ankh-Morpork who could be clothed from neck to ankle in brocade and still cause a classroom full of boys to blush to the roots of their hair. He reached down for the fruit bowl. One of the girls immediately grasped his hand, moved it gently aside, and took a grape. \u0027Please don\u0027t peel it,\u0027 said Teppic. \u0027The peel\u0027s the best part. Full of nourishing vitamins and minerals. Only I don\u0027t suppose you\u0027ve heard about them, have you, they\u0027ve only been invented recently,\u0027 he added, mainly to himself. \u0027I mean, within the last seven thousand years,\u0027 he finished sourly. So much for time flowing past, he thought glumly. It might do that everywhere else, but not here. Here it just piles up, like snow. It\u0027s as though the pyramids slow us down, like those things they used on the boat, whatd\u0027youcallem, sea anchors. Tomorrow here is just like yesterday, warmed over. She peeled the grape anyway, while the snowflake seconds drifted down. At the site of the Great Pyramid the huge blocks of stone floated into place like an explosion in reverse. They were flowing between the quarry and the site, drifting silently across the landscape above deep rectangular shadows. \u0027I\u0027ve got to hand it to you,\u0027 said Ptaclusp to his son, as they stood side by side in the observation tower. \u0027It\u0027s astonishing. One day people will wonder how we did it.\u0027 \u0027All that business with the log rollers and the whips is old hat,\u0027 said IIb. \u0027You-can throw them away.\u0027 The young architect smiled, but there was a manic hint to the rictus. It was astonishing. It was more astonishing than it ought to be. He kept getting the feeling that the pyramid was . . . He shook himself mentally. He should be ashamed of that sort of thinking. You could get superstitious if you weren\u0027t careful, in this job. It was natural for things to form a pyramid - well, a cone, anyway. He\u0027d experimented this morning. Grain, salt, . . . not water, though, that\u0027d been a mistake. But a pyramid was only a neat cone, wasn\u0027t it, a cone which had decided to be a bit tidier. Perhaps he\u0027d overdone it just a gnat on the paracosmic measurements? His father slapped him on the back. \u0027Very well done,\u0027 he repeated. \u0027You know, it almost looks as though it\u0027s building itself.\u0027 IIb yelped and bit his wrist, a childish trait that he always resorted to when he was nervous. Ptaclusp didn\u0027t notice, because at that moment one of the foremen was running to the foot of the tower, waving his ceremonial measuring rod. Ptaclusp leaned over. \u0027What?\u0027 he demanded. \u0027I said, please to come at once, O master!\u0027 On the pyramid itself, on the working surface about halfway up, where some of the detailed work on the inner chambers was in progress, the word \u0027impressive\u0027 was no longer appropriate. The word \u0027terrifying\u0027 seemed to fit the bill. Blocks were stacking up in the sky overhead in a giant, slow dance, passing and re-passing, their mahouts yelling at one another and at the luckless controllers down on the pyramid top, who were trying to shout instructions above the noise. Ptaclusp waded into the cluster of workers around the centre. Here, at least, there was silence. Dead silence. \u0027All right, all right,\u0027 he said. \u0027What\u0027s going . . . oh.\u0027 Ptaclusp IIb peered over his father\u0027s shoulder, and stuck his wrist in his mouth. The thing was wrinkled. It was ancient. It clearly had once been a living thing. It lay on the slab like a very obscene prune. \u0027It was my lunch,\u0027 said the chief plasterer. \u0027It was my bloody lunch. I was really looking forward to that apple.\u0027 \u0027But it can\u0027t start yet,\u0027 whispered IIb. \u0027It can\u0027t form temporal nodes yet, I mean, how does it know it\u0027s going to be a pyramid?\u0027 \u0027I put my hand down for it, and it felt just like . . . it felt pretty unpleasant,\u0027 the plasterer complained. \u0027And it\u0027s a negative node, too,\u0027 added IIb. \u0027We shouldn\u0027t be getting them at all.\u0027 \u0027Is it still there?\u0027 said Ptaclusp, and added, \u0027Tell me yes.\u0027 \u0027If more blocks have been set into position it won\u0027t be,\u0027 said his son, looking around wildly. \u0027As the centre of mass changes, you see, the nodes will be pulled around.\u0027 Ptaclusp pulled the young man to one side. \u0027What are you telling me now?\u0027 he demanded, in a camel whisper.[16] \u0027We ought to put a cap on it,\u0027 mumbled IIb. \u0027Flare off the trapped time. Wouldn\u0027t be any problems then . . .\u0027 \u0027How can we cap it? It isn\u0027t damn well finished,\u0027 said Ptaclusp. \u0027What have you been and gone and done? Pyramids don\u0027t start accumulating until they\u0027re finished. Until they\u0027re pyramids, see? Pyramid energy, see? Named after pyramids. That\u0027s why it\u0027s called pyramid energy.\u0027 \u0027It must be something to do with the mass, or something,\u0027 the architect hazarded, \u0027and the speed of construction. The time is getting trapped in the fabric. I mean, in theory you could get small nodes during construction, but they\u0027d be so weak you wouldn\u0027t notice; if you went and stood in one maybe you\u0027d become a few hours older or younger or-\u0027 he began to gabble. \u0027I recall when we did Kheneth XIV\u0027s tomb the fresco painter said it took him two hours to do the painting in the Queen\u0027s Room, and we said it was three days and fined him,\u0027 said Ptaclusp, slowly. \u0027There was a lot of Guild fuss, I remember.\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pyramids-discworld-7/page-15.html","bookId":1626,"book":{"id":1626,"title":"Pyramids (Discworld #7)","description":"Storyline: Pyramids (Discworld #7) It\u0027s bad enough being new on the job, but Teppic hasn\u0027t a clue as to what a pharaoh is supposed to do.
