{"id":95686,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"\u0027What, you mean the fabric of time and space being put through the wringer?\u0027 said IIa.\\n\\n The architect gave his brother a look of faint admiration. It was an unusual remark for an accountant. Then his face returned to its previous look of faint terror.\\n\\n \u0027No, not that,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027Well, the sound of the very air itself being subjected to horrible tortures?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not that, either,\u0027 said IIb, vaguely annoyed. \u0027I mean the creaking noise.\u0027\\n\\n Three more pyramids struck their discharges, which fizzled through the roiling clouds overhead and poured into the black marble above them.\\n\\n \u0027Can\u0027t hear anything like that,\u0027 said IIa.\\n\\n \u0027I think it\u0027s coming from the pyramid.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, you can put your ear against it if you like, but I\u0027m not going to.\u0027\\n\\n The scaffolding swayed in the storm as they eased their way up another ladder, the heavy capstone rocking between them.\\n\\n \u0027I said we shouldn\u0027t do it,\u0027 muttered the accountant, as the stone slid gently on to his toes. \u0027We shouldn\u0027t have built this.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Just shut up and lift your end, will you?\u0027\\n\\n And so, one rocking ladder after another, the brothers Ptaclusp eased their bickering way up the flanks of the Great Pyramid, while the lesser tombs along the Djel fired one after another, and the sky streamed with lines of sizzling time.\\n\\n It was around about this point that the greatest mathematician in the world, lying in cosy flatulence in his stall below the palace, stopped chewing the cud and realised that something very wrong was happening to numbers. All the numbers.\\n\\n The camel looked along its nose at Teppic. Its expression made it clear that of all the riders in all the world it would least like to ride it, he was right at the top of the list. However, camels look like that at everyone. Camels have a very democratic approach to the human race. They hate every member of it, without making any distinctions for rank or creed.\\n\\n This one appeared to be chewing soap.\\n\\n Teppic looked distractedly down the shadowy length of the royal stables, which had once contained a hundred camels. He\u0027d have given the world for a horse, and a moderately-sized continent for a pony. But the stables now held only a handful of rotting war chariots, relics of past glories, an elderly elephant whose presence was a bit of a mystery, and this camel. It looked an extremely inefficient animal. It was going threadbare at the knees.\\n\\n \u0027Well, this is it,\u0027 he said to Ptraci. \u0027I don\u0027t dare try the river during the night. I could try and get you over the border.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Is that saddle on right?\u0027 said Ptraci. \u0027It looks awfully funny.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s on an awfully odd creature,\u0027 said Teppic. \u0027How do we climb on to it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve seen the camel drivers at work,\u0027 she replied. \u0027I think they just hit them very hard with a big stick.\u0027\\n\\n The camel knelt down and gave her a smug look.\\n\\n Teppic shrugged, pulled open the doors to the outside world, and stared into the faces of five guards.\\n\\n He backed away. They advanced. Three of them were holding the heavy Djel bows, which could propel an arrow through a door or turn a charging hippo into three tons of mobile kebab. The guards had never had to fire them at a fellow human, but looked as though they were prepared to entertain the idea.\\n\\n The guard captain tapped one of the men on the shoulder, and said, \u0027Go and inform the high priest.\u0027\\n\\n He glared at Teppic.\\n\\n \u0027Throw down all your weapons,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027What, all of them?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes. All of them.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It might take some time,\u0027 said Teppic cautiously.\\n\\n \u0027And keep your hands where I can see them,\u0027 the captain added.\\n\\n \u0027We could be up against a real impasse here,\u0027 Teppic ventured. He looked from one guard to another. He knew a variety of methods of unarmed combat, but they all rather relied on the opponent not being about to fire an arrow straight through you as soon as you moved. But he could probably dive sideways, and once he had the cover of the camel stalls he could bide his time\\n\\n And that would leave Ptraci exposed. Besides, he could hardly go around fighting his own guards. That wasn\u0027t acceptable behaviour, even for a king.\\n\\n There was a movement behind the guards and Dios drifted into view, as silent and inevitable as an eclipse of the moon. He was holding a lighted torch, which reflected wild highlights on his bald head.\\n\\n \u0027Ah,\u0027 he said. \u0027The miscreants are captured. Well done.\u0027 He nodded to the captain. \u0027Throw them to the crocodiles.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Dios?\u0027 said Teppic, as two of the guards lowered their bows and bore down on him.\\n\\n \u0027Did you speak?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You know who I am, man. Don\u0027t be silly.\u0027\\n\\n The high priest raised the torch.\\n\\n \u0027You have the advantage of me, boy,\u0027 he said. \u0027Metaphorically speaking.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027This is not funny,\u0027 said Teppic. \u0027I order you to tell them who I am.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027As you wish. This assassin,\u0027 said Dios, and the voice had the cut and sear of a thermic lance, \u0027has killed the king.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I am the king, damn it,\u0027 said Teppic. \u0027How could I kill myself?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We are not stupid,\u0027 said Dios. \u0027These men know the king does not skulk the palace at night, or consort with condemned criminals. All that remains for us to find out is how you disposed of the body.\u0027\\n\\n His eyes fixed on Teppic\u0027s face, and Teppic realised that the high priest was, indeed, truly mad. It was the rare kind of madness caused by being yourself for so long that habits of sanity have etched themselves into the brain. I wonder how old he really is? he thought.\\n\\n \u0027These assassins are cunning creatures,\u0027 said Dios. \u0027Have a care of him.\u0027\\n\\n There was a crash beside the priest. Ptraci had tried to throw a camel prod, and missed.\\n\\n When everyone looked back Teppic had vanished. The guards beside him were busy collapsing slowly to the floor, groaning.\\n\\n Dios smiled.\\n\\n \u0027Take the woman,\u0027 he snapped, and the captain darted forward and grabbed Ptraci, who hadn\u0027t made any attempt to run away. Dios bent down and picked up the prod.\\n\\n \u0027There are more guards outside,\u0027 he said. \u0027I\u0027m sure you will realise that. It will be in your interests to step forward.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why?\u0027 said Teppic, from the shadows. He fumbled in his boot for his blowpipe.\\n\\n \u0027You will then be thrown to the sacred crocodiles, by order of the king,\u0027 said Dios.\\n\\n \u0027Something to look forward to, eh?\u0027 said Teppic, feverishly screwing bits together.\\n\\n \u0027It would certainly be preferable to many alternatives,\u0027 said Dios.\\n\\n In the darkness Teppic ran his fingers over the little coded knobs on the darts. Most of the really spectacular poisons would have evaporated or dissolved into harmlessness by now, but there were a number of lesser potions designed to give their clients nothing more than a good night\u0027s sleep. An assassin might have to work his way to an inhume past a number of alert bodyguards. It was considered impolite to inhume them as well.\\n\\n \u0027You could let us go,\u0027 said Teppic. \u0027I suspect that\u0027s what you want, isn\u0027t it? For me to go away and never come back? That suits me fine.\u0027\\n\\n Dios hesitated.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re supposed to say “And let the girl go”,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, yes. And that, too,\u0027 said Teppic.\\n\\n \u0027No. I would be failing in my duty to the king,\u0027 said Dios.\\n\\n \u0027For goodness sake, Dios, you know I am the king!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No. I have a very clear picture of the king. You are not the king,\u0027 said the priest.\\n\\n Teppic peered over the edge of the camel stall. The camel peered over his shoulder.\\n\\n And then the world went mad.\\n\\n All right, madder.\\n\\n All the pyramids were blazing now, filling the sky with their sooty light as the brothers Ptaclusp struggled to the main working platform.\\n\\n IIa collapsed on the planking, wheezing like an elderly bellows. A few feet away the sloping side was hot to the touch, and there was no doubt in his mind now that the pyramid was creaking, like a sailing ship in a gale. He had never paid much attention to the actual mechanics as opposed to the cost of pyramid construction, but he was pretty certain that the noise was as wrong as II and II making V.\\n\\n His brother reached out to touch the stone, but drew his hand back as small sparks flashed around his fingers.\\n\\n \u0027You can feel the warmth,\u0027 he said. \u0027It\u0027s astonishing!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Heating up a mass like this. I mean, the sheer tonnage...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t like it, Two-bee,\u0027 IIa quavered. \u0027Let\u0027s just leave the stone here, shall we? I\u0027m sure it\u0027ll be all right, and in the morning we can send a gang up here, they\u0027ll know exactly what-\u0027\\n\\n His words were drowned out as another flare crackled across the sky and hit the column of dancing air fifty feet above them. He grabbed part of the scaffolding.\\n\\n \u0027Sod take this,\u0027 he said. \u0027I\u0027m off.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hang on a minute,\u0027 said IIb. \u0027I mean, what is creaking? Stone can\u0027t creak.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The whole bloody scaffolding is moving, don\u0027t be daft!\u0027 He stared goggle-eyed at his brother. \u0027Tell me it\u0027s the scaffolding,\u0027 he pleaded.\\n\\n \u0027No, I\u0027m certain this time. It\u0027s coming from inside.\u0027 They stared at one another, and then at the rickety ladder leading up to the tip, or to where the tip should be.\\n\\n \u0027Come on!\u0027 said IIb. \u0027It can\u0027t flare off, it\u0027s trying to find ways of discharging-\u0027\\n\\n There was a sound as loud as the groaning of continents.\\n\\n Teppic felt it. He felt that his skin was several sizes too small. He felt that someone was holding his ears and trying to twist his head off.\\n\\n He saw the guard captain sag to his knees, fighting to get his helmet off, and he leapt the stall.\\n\\n Tried to leap the stall. Everything was wrong, and he landed heavily on a floor that seemed undecided about becoming a wall. He managed to get to his feet and was pulled sideways, dancing awkwardly across the stable to keep his balance.\\n\\n The stables stretched and shrank like a picture in a distorting mirror. He\u0027d gone to see some once in Ankh, the three of them hazarding a half-coin each to visit the transient marvels of Dr Mooner\u0027s Travelling Take Your Breath Away Emporium. But you knew then that it was only twisted glass that was giving you a head like a sausage and legs like footballs. Teppic wished he could be so certain that what was happening around him would allow of such a harmless explanation. You\u0027d probably need a wobbly glass mirror to make it look normal.\\n\\n He ran on taffy legs towards Ptraci and the high priest as the world was expanded and squeezed around him, and was momentarily gratified to see the girl squirm in Dios\u0027s grip and fetch him a tidy thump on the ear.\\n\\n He moved as though in a dream, with the distances changing as though reality was an elastic thing. Another step sent him cannoning into the pair of them. He grabbed Ptraci\u0027s arm and staggered back to the camel stall, where the creature was still cudding and watching the scene with the nearest thing a camel will ever get to mild interest, and snatched its halter.\\n\\n No-one seemed to be interested in stopping them as they helped each other through the doorway and out into the mad night.\\n\\n \u0027It helps if you shut your eyes,\u0027 said Ptraci.\\n\\n Teppic tried it. It worked. A stretch of courtyard that his eyes told him was a quivering rectangle whose sides twanged like bowstrings became, well, just a courtyard under his feet.\\n\\n \u0027Gosh, that was clever,\u0027 he said. \u0027How did you think of that?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I always shut my eyes when I\u0027m frightened,\u0027 said Ptraci.\\n\\n \u0027Good plan.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s happening?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t want to find out. I think going away from here could be an amazingly sensible idea. How do you make a camel kneel, did you say? I\u0027ve got any amount of sharp things.\u0027\\n\\n The camel, who had a very adequate grasp of human language as it applied to threats, knelt down graciously. They scrambled aboard and the landscape lurched again as the beast jacked itself back on to its feet.\\n\\n The camel knew perfectly well what was happening. Three stomachs and a digestive system like an industrial distillation plant gave you a lot of time for sitting and thinking. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pyramids-discworld-7/page-22.html","bookId":1626,"book":{"id":1626,"title":"Pyramids (Discworld #7)","description":"Storyline: Pyramids (Discworld #7) \\n It\u0027s bad enough being new on the job, but Teppic hasn\u0027t a clue as to what a pharaoh is supposed to do.
