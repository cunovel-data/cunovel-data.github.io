{"id":95667,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"The trouble is that it soon will.\n Whatever the reason, Teppic was suddenly acutely aware of things around him. The way the moonlight glowed on the rooftops. The smell of fresh bread wafting from a nearby bakery. The whirring of a cockchafer as it barrelled past his ear, upwards. The sound of a baby crying, in the distance, and the bark of a dog. The gentle rush of the air, with particular reference to its thinness and lack of handholds.\n There had been more than seventy of them enrolling that year. The Assassins didn\u0027t have a very strenuous entrance examination; the school was easy to get into, easy to get out of (the trick was to get out upright). The courtyard in the centre of the Guild buildings was thronged with boys who all had two things in common - overlarge trunks, which they were sitting on, and clothes that had been selected for them to grow into, and which they were more or less sitting in. Some optimists had brought weapons with them, which were confiscated and sent home over the next few weeks.\n Teppic watched them carefully. There were distinct advantages to being the only child of parents too preoccupied with their own affairs to worry much about him, or indeed register his existence for days at a time.\n His mother, as far as he could remember, had been a pleasant woman and as self-centred as a gyroscope. She\u0027d liked cats. She didn\u0027t just venerate them - everyone in the kingdom did that - but she actually liked them, too. Teppic knew that it was traditional in river kingdoms to approve of cats, but he suspected that usually the animals in question were graceful stately creatures; his mother\u0027s cats were small, spitting, flat-headed, yellow-eyed maniacs.\n His father spent a lot of time worrying about the kingdom and occasionally declaring that he was a seagull, although this was probably from general forgetfulness. Teppic had occasionally speculated about his own conception, since his parents were rarely in the same frame of reference, let alone the same state of mind.\n But it had apparently happened and he was left to bring himself up on a trial and error basis, mildly hindered and occasionally enlivened by a succession of tutors. The ones hired by his father were best, especially on those days when he was flying as high as he could, and for one glorious winter Teppic had as his tutor an elderly ibis poacher who had in fact wandered into the royal gardens in search of a stray arrow.\n That had been a time of wild chases with soldiers, moonlight rambles in the dead streets of the necropolis and, best of all, the introduction to the puntbow, a fearsomely complicated invention which at considerable risk to its operators could turn a slough full of innocent waterfowl into so much floating pâté.\n He\u0027d also had the run of the library, including the locked shelves - the poacher had several other skills to ensure gainful employment in inclement weather - which had given him many hours of quiet study; he was particularly attached to The Shuttered Palace, Translated from the Khalian by A Gentleman, with Hand-Coloured Plates for the Connoisseur in A Strictly Limited Edition. It was confusing but instructive and, when a rather fey young tutor engaged by the priests tried to introduce him to certain athletic techniques favoured by the classical Pseudopolitans, Teppic considered the suggestion for some time and then floored the youth with a hatstand.\n Teppic hadn\u0027t been educated. Education had just settled on him, like dandruff.\n It started to rain, in the world outside his head. Another new experience. He\u0027d heard about it, of course, how water came down out of the sky in small bits. He just hadn\u0027t expected there to be so much of it. It never rained in Djelibeybi.\n Masters moved among the boys like damp and slightly scruffy blackbirds, but he was eyeing a group of older students lolling near the pillared entrance to the school. They also wore black - different colours of black.\n That was his first introduction to the tertiary colours, the colours on the far side of blackness, the colours that you get if you split blackness with an eight-sided prism. They are also almost impossible to describe in a non-magical environment, but if someone were to try they\u0027d probably start by telling you to smoke something illegal and take a good look at a starling\u0027s wing. The seniors were critically inspecting the new arrivals.\n Teppic stared at them. Apart from the colours, their clothes were cut off the edge of the latest fashion, which was currently inclining towards wide hats, padded shoulders, narrow waists and pointed shoes and gave its followers the appearance of being very well-dressed nails.\n I\u0027m going to be like them, he told himself.\n Although probably better dressed, he added.\n He recalled Uncle Vyrt, sitting out on the steps overlooking the Djel on one of his brief, mysterious visits. \u0027Satin and leather are no good. Or jewellery of any kind. You can\u0027t have anything that will shine or squeak or clink. Stick to rough silk or velvet. The important thing is not how many people you inhume, it\u0027s how many fail to inhume you.\u0027\n He\u0027d been moving at an unwise pace, which might assist now. As he arced over the emptiness of the alley he twisted in the air, thrust out his arms desperately, and felt his fingertips brush a ledge on the building opposite. It was enough to pivot him; he swung around, hit the crumbling brickwork with sufficient force to knock what remained of his breath out of him, and slid down the sheer wall.\n \u0027Boy!\u0027\n Teppic looked up. There was a senior assassin standing beside him, with a purple teaching sash over his robes. It was the first assassin he\u0027d seen, apart from Vyrt. The man was pleasant enough. You could imagine him making sausages.\n \u0027Are you talking to me?\u0027 he said.\n \u0027You will stand up when you address a master,\u0027 said the rosy face.\n \u0027I will?\u0027 Teppic was fascinated. He wondered how this could be achieved. Discipline had not hitherto been a major feature in his life. Most of his tutors had been sufficiently unnerved by the sight of the king occasionally perched on top of a door that they raced through such lessons as they had and then locked themselves in their rooms.\n \u0027I will sir,\u0027 said the teacher. He consulted the list in his hand.\n \u0027What is your name, boy?\u0027 he continued.\n \u0027Prince Pteppic of the Old Kingdom, the Kingdom of the Sun,\u0027 said Teppic easily. \u0027I appreciate you are ignorant of the etiquette, but you should not call me sir, and you should touch the ground with your forehead when you address me.\u0027\n \u0027Pateppic, is it?\u0027 said the master.\n \u0027No. Pteppic.\u0027\n \u0027Ah. Teppic,\u0027 said the master, and ticked off a name on his list. He gave Teppic a generous smile.\n \u0027Well, now, your majesty,\u0027 he said, \u0027I am Grunworth Nivor, your housemaster. You are in Viper House. To my certain knowledge there are at least eleven Kingdoms of the Sun on the Disc and, before the end of the week, you will present me with a short essay detailing their geographical location, political complexion, capital city or principal seat of government, and a suggested route into the bed- chamber of the head of state of your choice. However, in all the world there is only one Viper House. Good morning to you, boy.\u0027\n He turned away and homed in on another cowering pupil. \u0027He\u0027s not a bad sort,\u0027 said a voice behind Teppic. \u0027Anyway, all the stuffs in the library. I\u0027ll show you if you like. I\u0027m Chidder.\n Teppic turned. He was being addressed by a boy of about his own age and height, whose black suit - plain black, for First Years - looked as though it had been nailed on to him in bits. The youth was holding out a hand. Teppic gave it a polite glance.\n \u0027Yes?\u0027 he said.\n \u0027What\u0027s your name, kiddo?\u0027\n Teppic drew himself up. He was getting fed up with this treatment. \u0027Kiddo? I\u0027ll have you know the blood of pharaohs runs in my veins!\u0027\n The other boy looked at him unabashed, with his head on one side and a faint smile on his face.\n \u0027Would you like it to stay there?\u0027 he said.\n The baker was just along the alley, and a handful of the staff had stepped out into the comparative cool of the pre-dawn air for a quick smoke and a break from the desert heat of the ovens. Their chattering spiralled up to Teppic, high in the shadows, gripping a fortuitous window sill while his feet scrabbled for a purchase among the bricks.\n It\u0027s not that bad, he told himself. You\u0027ve tackled worse. The hubward face of the Patrician\u0027s palace last winter, for example, when all the gutters had overflowed and the walls were solid ice. This isn\u0027t much more than a 3, maybe a 3.2. You and old Chiddy used to go up walls like this rather than stroll down the street, it\u0027s just a matter of perspective.\n Perspective. He glanced down, at seventy feet of infinity. Splat City, man, get a grip on yourself. On the wall. His right foot found a worn section of mortar, into which his toes planted themselves with barely a conscious instruction from a brain now feeling too fragile to take more than a distant interest in the proceedings.\n He took a breath, tensed, and then dropped one hand to his belt, seized a dagger, and thrust it between the bricks beside him before gravity worked out what was happening. He paused, panting, waiting for gravity to lose interest in him again, and then swung his body sideways and tried the same thing a second time.\n Down below one of the bakers told a suggestive joke, and brushed a speck of mortar from his ear. As his colleagues laughed Teppic stood up in the moonlight, balancing on two slivers of Klatchian steel, and gently walked his palms up the wall to the window whose sill had been his brief salvation.\n It was wedged shut. A good blow would surely open it, but only at about the same moment as it sent him reeling back into empty air. Teppic sighed and, moving with the delicacy of a watchmaker, drew his diamond compasses from their pouch and dragged a slow, gentle circle on the dusty glass...\n \u0027You carry it yourself,\u0027 said Chidder. \u0027That\u0027s the rule around here.\u0027\n Teppic looked at the trunk. It was an intriguing notion. \u0027At home we\u0027ve people who do that,\u0027 he said. \u0027Eunuchs and so on.\n \u0027You should of brought one with you.\u0027\n \u0027They don\u0027t travel well,\u0027 said Teppic. In fact he\u0027d adamantly refused all suggestions that a small retinue should accompany him, and Dios had sulked for days. That was not how a member of the royal blood should go forth into the world, he said. Teppic had remained firm. He was pretty certain that assassins weren\u0027t expected to go about their business accompanied by handmaidens and buglers. Now, however, the idea seemed to have some merit. He gave the trunk an experimental heave, and managed to get it across his shoulders.\n \u0027Your people are pretty rich, then?\u0027 said Chidder, ambling along beside him.\n Teppic thought about this. \u0027No, not really,\u0027 he said. \u0027They mainly grow melons and garlic and that kind of thing. And stand in the streets and shout “hurrah”.\u0027\n \u0027This is your parents you\u0027re talking about?\u0027 said Chidder, puzzled.\n \u0027Oh, them? No, my father\u0027s a pharaoh. My mother was a concubine. I think.\u0027\n \u0027I thought that was some sort of vegetable.\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t think so. We\u0027ve never really discussed it. Anyway, she died when I was young.\n \u0027How dreadful,\u0027 said Chidder cheerfully.\n \u0027She went for a moonlight swim in what turned out to be a crocodile.\u0027 Teppic tried politely not to be hurt at the boy\u0027s reaction.\n \u0027My father\u0027s in commerce,\u0027 said Chidder, as they passed through the archway.\n \u0027That\u0027s fascinating,\u0027 said Teppic dutifully. He felt quite broken by all these new experiences, and added, \u0027I\u0027ve never been to Commerce, but I understand they\u0027re very fine people.\u0027\n Over the next hour or two Chidder, who ambled gently through life as though he\u0027d already worked it all out, introduced Teppic to the various mysteries of the dormitories, the classrooms and the plumbing. He left the plumbing until last, for all sorts of reasons. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pyramids-discworld-7/page-3.html","bookId":1626,"book":{"id":1626,"title":"Pyramids (Discworld #7)","description":"Storyline: \n Pyramids (Discworld #7) \n It\u0027s bad enough being new on the job, but Teppic hasn\u0027t a clue as to what a pharaoh is supposed to do.
