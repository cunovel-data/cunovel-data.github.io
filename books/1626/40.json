{"id":95704,"no":40,"title":"Page 40","content":"A breeze from the sea blew into the kingdom, hinting at, no, positively roaring suggestions of salt, shellfish and sun-soaked tidelines. A few rather puzzled seabirds wheeled over the necropolis, where the wind scurried among the fallen masonry and covered with sand the memorials to ancient kings, and the birds said more with a simple bowel movement than Ozymandias ever managed to say. The wind had a cool, not unpleasant edge to it. The people out repairing the damage caused by the gods felt an urge to turn their faces towards it, as fish in a pond turn towards an influx of clear, fresh water. No-one worked in the necropolis. Most of the pyramids had blown their upper levels clean off, and stood smoking gently like recently-extinct volcanoes. Here and there slabs of black marble littered the landscape. One of them had nearly decapitated a fine statue of Hat, the Vulture-Headed God. The ancestors had vanished. No-one was volunteering to go and look for them. Around midday a ship came up the Djel under full sail. It was a deceptive ship. It seemed to wallow like a fat and unprotected hippo, and it was only after watching it for some time that anyone would realise that it was also making remarkably fast progress. It dropped anchor outside the palace. After a while, it let down a dinghy. Teppic sat on the throne and watched the life of the kingdom reassemble itself, like a smashed mirror that is put together again and reflects the same old light in new and unexpected ways. No-one was quite sure on what basis he was on the throne, but no-one else was at all keen on occupying it and it was a relief to hear instructions issued in a clear, confident voice. It is amazing what people will obey, if a clear and confident voice is used, and the kingdom was well used to a clear, confident voice. Besides, giving orders stopped him thinking about things. Like, for example, what would happen next. But at least the gods had gone back to not existing again, which made it a whole lot easier to believe in them, and the grass didn\u0027t seem to be growing under his feet any more. Maybe I can put the kingdom together again, he thought. But then what can I do with it? If only we could find Dios. He always knew what to do, that was the main thing about him. A guard pushed his way through the milling throng of priests and nobles. \u0027Excuse me, your sire,\u0027 he said. \u0027There\u0027s a merchant to see you. He says it\u0027s urgent.\u0027 \u0027Not now, man. There\u0027s representatives of the Tsortean and Ephebian armies coming to see me in an hour, and there\u0027s a great deal that\u0027s got to be done first. I can\u0027t go around seeing any salesmen who happen to be passing. What\u0027s he selling, anyway?\u0027 \u0027Carpets, your sire.\u0027 \u0027Carpets?\u0027 It was Chidder, grinning like half a watermelon, followed by several of the crew. He walked up the hall staring around at the frescoes and hangings. Because it was Chidder, he was probably costing them out. By the time he reached the throne he was drawing a double line under the total. \u0027Nice place,\u0027 he said, wrapping up thousands of years of architectural accumulation in a mere two syllables. \u0027You\u0027ll never guess what happened, we just happened to be sailing along the coast and suddenly there was this river. One minute cliffs, next minute river. There\u0027s a funny thing, I thought. I bet old Teppic\u0027s up there somewhere.\u0027 \u0027Where\u0027s Ptraci?\u0027 \u0027I knew you were complaining about the lack of the old home comforts, so we brought you this carpet.\u0027 \u0027I said, where\u0027s Ptraci?\u0027 The crew moved aside, leaving a grinning Alfonz to cut the strings around the carpet and shake it out. It uncurled swiftly across the floor in a flurry of dust balls and moths and, eventually, Ptraci, who continued rolling until her head hit Teppic\u0027s boot. He helped her to her feet and tried to pick bits of fluff out of her hair as she swayed backwards and forwards. She ignored him and turned to Chidder, red with breathlessness and fury. \u0027I could have died in there!\u0027 she shouted. \u0027Lots of other things have, by the smell! And the heat!\u0027 \u0027You said it worked for Queen wossname, Ram-Jam-Hurrah, or whoever,\u0027 said Chidder. \u0027Don\u0027t blame me, at home a necklace or something is usually the thing.\u0027 \u0027I bet she had a decent carpet,\u0027 snapped Ptraci. \u0027Not something stuck in a bloody hold for six months.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re lucky we had one at all,\u0027 said Chidder mildly. \u0027It was your idea.\u0027 \u0027Huh,\u0027 said Ptraci. She turned to Teppic. \u0027Hallo,\u0027 she said. \u0027This was meant to be a startling original surprise.\u0027 \u0027It worked,\u0027 said Teppic fervently. \u0027It really worked.\u0027 Chidder lay on a daybed on the palace\u0027s veranda, while three handmaidens took turns to peel grapes for him. A pitcher of beer stood cooling in the shade. He was grinning amiably. On a blanket nearby Alfonz lay on his stomach, feeling extremely awkward. The Mistress of the Women had found out that, in addition to the tattoos on his forearms, his back was a veritable illustrated history of exotic practices, and had brought the girls out to be educated. He winced occasionally as her pointer stabbed at items of particular interest, and stuffed his fingers firmly in his great, scarred ears to shut out the giggles. At the far end of the veranda, given privacy by unspoken agreement, Teppic sat with Ptraci. Things were not going well. \u0027Everything changed,\u0027 he said. \u0027I\u0027m not going to be king.\u0027 \u0027You are the king,\u0027 she said. \u0027You can\u0027t change things.\u0027 \u0027I can. I can abdicate. It\u0027s very simple. If I\u0027m not really the king, then I can go whenever I please. If I am the king, then the king\u0027s word is final and I can abdicate. If we can change sex by decree, we can certainly change station. They can find a relative to do the job. I must have dozens.\u0027 \u0027The job? Anyway, you said there was only your auntie.\u0027 Teppic frowned. Aunt Cleph-ptah-re was not, on reflection, the kind of monarch a kingdom needed if it was going to make a fresh start. She had a number of stoutly-held views on a variety of subjects, but most of them involved the flaying alive of people she disapproved of. This meant most people under the age of thirty-five, to start with. \u0027Well, someone else, then,\u0027 he said. \u0027It shouldn\u0027t be difficult, we\u0027ve always seemed to have more nobles than really necessary. We\u0027ll just have to find one who has the dream about the cows.\u0027 \u0027Oh, the one where there\u0027s fat cows and thin cows?\u0027 said Ptraci. \u0027Yes. It\u0027s sort of ancestral.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s a nuisance, I know that much. One of them\u0027s always grinning and playing a wimblehorn.\u0027 \u0027It looks like a trombone to me,\u0027 said Teppic. \u0027It\u0027s a ceremonial wimblehorn, if you look closely,\u0027 she said. \u0027Well, I expect everyone sees it a bit differently. I don\u0027t think it matters.\u0027 He sighed, and watched the Unnamed unloading. It seemed to have more than the expected number of feather mattresses, and several of the people wandering bemusedly down the gangplank were holding toolboxes and lengths of pipe. \u0027I think you\u0027re going to find it difficult,\u0027 said Ptraci. \u0027You can\u0027t say “All those who dream about cows please step forward”. It\u0027d give the game away.\u0027 \u0027I can\u0027t just hang around until someone happens to mention it, can I? Be reasonable,\u0027 he snapped. \u0027How many people are likely to say, hey, I had this funny dream about cows last night? Apart from you, I mean.\u0027 They stared at one another. \u0027And she\u0027s my sister?\u0027 said Teppic. The priests nodded. It was left to Koomi to put it into words. He\u0027d just spent ten minutes going through the files with the Mistress of the Women. \u0027Her mother was, er, your late father\u0027s favourite,\u0027 he said. \u0027He took a great deal of interest in her upbringing, as you know, and, er, it would appear that . . . yes. She may be your aunt, of course. The concubines are never very good at paperwork. But most likely your sister.\u0027 She looked at him with tear-filled eyes. \u0027That doesn\u0027t make any difference, does it?\u0027 she whispered. Teppic stared at his feet. \u0027Yes,\u0027 he said. \u0027I think it does, really.\u0027 He looked up at her. \u0027But you can be queen,\u0027 he added. He glared at the priests. \u0027Can\u0027t she,\u0027 he stated firmly. The high priests looked at one another. Then they looked at Ptraci, who stood alone, her shoulders shaking. Small, palace trained, used to taking orders . . . They looked at Koomi. \u0027She would be ideal,\u0027 he said. There was a murmur of suddenly-confident agreement. \u0027There you are then,\u0027 said Teppic, consolingly. She glared at him. He backed away. \u0027So I\u0027ll be off,\u0027 he said, \u0027I don\u0027t need to pack anything, it\u0027s all right.\u0027 \u0027Just like that?\u0027 she said. \u0027Is that all? Isn\u0027t there anything you\u0027re going to say?\u0027 He hesitated, halfway to the door. You could stay, he told himself. It wouldn\u0027t work, though. It\u0027d end up a terrible mess; you\u0027d probably end up splitting the kingdom between you. Just because fate throws you together doesn\u0027t mean fate\u0027s got it right. Anyway, you\u0027ve been forth. \u0027Camels are more important than pyramids,\u0027 he said slowly. \u0027It\u0027s something we should always remember.\u0027 He ran for it while she was looking for something to throw. The sun reached the peak of noon without beetles, and Koomi hovered by the throne like Hat, the Vulture-Headed God. \u0027It will please your majesty to confirm my succession as high priest,\u0027 he said. \u0027What?\u0027 Ptraci was sitting with her chin cupped in one hand. She waved the other hand at him. \u0027Oh. Yes. All right. Fine.\u0027 \u0027No trace has, alas, been found of Dios. We believe he was very close to the Great Pyramid when it . . . flared.\u0027 Ptraci stared into space. \u0027You carry on,\u0027 she said. Koomi preened. \u0027The formal coronation will take some time to arrange,\u0027 he said, taking the golden mask. \u0027However, your graciousness will be pleased to wear the mask of authority now, for there is much formal business to be concluded.\u0027 She looked at the mask. \u0027I\u0027m not wearing that,\u0027 she said flatly. Koomi smiled. \u0027Your majesty will be pleased to wear the mask of authority,\u0027 he said. \u0027No,\u0027 said Ptraci. Koomi\u0027s smile crazed a little around the edges as he attempted to get to grips with this new concept. He was sure Dios had never had this trouble. He got over the problem by sidling round it. Sidling had stood him in good stead all his life; he wasn\u0027t going to desert it now. He put the mask down very carefully on a stool. \u0027It is the First Hour,\u0027 he said. \u0027Your majesty will wish to conduct the Ritual of the Ibis, and then graciously grant an audience to the military commanders of the Tsortean and Ephebian armies. Both are seeking permission to cross the kingdom. Your majesty will forbid this. At the Second Hour, there will-\u0027 Ptraci sat drumming her fingers on the arms of the throne. Then she took a deep breath. \u0027I\u0027m going to have a bath,\u0027 she said. Koomi rocked back and forth a bit. \u0027It is the First Hour,\u0027 he repeated, unable to think of anything else. \u0027Your majesty will wish to conduct-\u0027 \u0027Koomi?\u0027 \u0027Yes, O noble queen?\u0027 \u0027Shut up.\u0027 \u0027The Ritual of the Ibis-\u0027 Koomi moaned. \u0027I\u0027m sure you\u0027re capable of doing it yourself. You look like a man who does things himself, if ever I saw one,\u0027 she added sourly. \u0027The commanders of the Tsortean-\u0027 \u0027Tell them,\u0027 Ptraci began, and then paused. \u0027Tell them,\u0027 she repeated, \u0027that they may both cross. Not one or the other, you understand? Both.\u0027 \u0027But-\u0027 Koomi \u0027s understanding managed at last to catch up with his ears - \u0027that means they\u0027ll end up on opposite sides.\u0027 \u0027Good. And after that you can order some camels. There\u0027s a merchant in Ephebe with a good stock. Check their teeth first. Oh, and then you can ask the captain of the Unnamed to come and see me. He was explaining to me what a “free port” is.\u0027 \u0027In your bath, O queen?\u0027 said Koomi weakly. He couldn\u0027t help noticing, now, how her voice was changing with each sentence as the veneer of upbringing burned away under the blowlamp of heredity.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pyramids-discworld-7/page-40.html","bookId":1626,"book":{"id":1626,"title":"Pyramids (Discworld #7)","description":"Storyline: Pyramids (Discworld #7) It\u0027s bad enough being new on the job, but Teppic hasn\u0027t a clue as to what a pharaoh is supposed to do.
