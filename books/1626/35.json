You think I\u0027m stupid? You\u0027ve got to tell me the answer.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, blow,\u0027 said Teppic.\n \u0027Thought you had me there, didn\u0027t you?\u0027 said the Sphinx.\n \u0027Sorry.\u0027\n \u0027You thought you could get me all confused, did you?\u0027\n The Sphinx grinned.\n \u0027It was worth a try,\u0027 said Teppic.\n \u0027Can\u0027t blame you. So what\u0027s the answer, then?\u0027\n Teppic scratched his nose.\n \u0027Haven\u0027t a clue,\u0027 he said. \u0027Unless, and this is a shot in the dark, you understand, it\u0027s: A Man.\u0027\n The Sphinx glared at him.\n \u0027You\u0027ve been here before, haven\u0027t you?\u0027 it said accusingly.\n \u0027No.\u0027\n \u0027Then someone\u0027s been talking, right?\u0027\n \u0027Who could have talked? Has anyone ever guessed the riddle?\u0027 said Teppic.\n \u0027No!\u0027\n \u0027Well, then. They couldn\u0027t have talked, could they?\u0027\n The Sphinx\u0027s claws scrabbled irritably on its rock.\n \u0027I suppose you\u0027d better move along, then,\u0027 it grumbled.\n \u0027Thank you,\u0027 said Teppic.\n \u0027I\u0027d be grateful if you didn\u0027t tell anyone, please,\u0027 added the Sphinx, coldly. \u0027I wouldn\u0027t like to spoil it for other people.\u0027\n Teppic scrambled up a rock and on to You Bastard.\n \u0027Don\u0027t you worry about that,\u0027 he said, spurring the camel onwards. He couldn\u0027t help noticing the way the Sphinx was moving its lips silently, as though trying to work something out.\n You Bastard had gone only twenty yards or so before an enraged bellow erupted behind him. For once he forgot the etiquette that says a camel must be hit with a stick before it does anything. All four feet hit the sand and pushed.\n This time he got it right.\n The priests were going irrational.\n It wasn\u0027t that the gods were disobeying them. The gods were ignoring them.\n The gods always had. It took great skill to persuade a Djelibeybi god to obey you, and the priests had to be fast on their toes. For example, if you pushed a rock off a cliff, then a quick request to the gods that it should fall down was certain to be answered. In the same way, the gods ensured that the sun set and the stars came out. Any petition to the gods to see to it that palm trees grew with their roots in the ground and their leaves on top was certain to be graciously accepted. On the whole, any priest who cared about such things could ensure a high rate of success.\n However, it was one thing for the gods to ignore you when they were far off and invisible, and quite another when they were strolling across the landscape. It made you feel such a fool.\n \u0027Why don\u0027t they listen?\u0027 said the high priest of Teg, the Horse-Headed god of agriculture. He was in tears. Teg had last been seen sitting in a field, pulling up corn and giggling.\n The other high priests were faring no better. Rituals hallowed by time had filled the air in the palace with sweet blue smoke and cooked enough assorted livestock to feed a famine, but the gods were settling in the Old Kingdom as if they owned it, and the people therein were no more than insects.\n And the crowds were still outside. Religion had ruled in the Old Kingdom for the best part of seven thousand years. Behind the eyes of every priest present was a graphic image of what would happen if the people ever thought, for one moment, that it ruled no more.\n \u0027And so, Dios,\u0027 said Koomi, \u0027we turn to you. What would you have us do now?\u0027\n Dios sat on the steps of the throne and stared gloomily at the floor. The gods didn\u0027t listen. He knew that. He knew that, of all people. But it had never mattered before. You just went through the motions and came up with an answer. It was the ritual that was important, not the gods. The gods were there to do the duties of a megaphone, because who else would people listen to?\n While he fought to think clearly his hands went through the motions of the Ritual of the Seventh Hour, guided by neural instructions as rigid and unchangeable as crystals.\n \u0027You have tried everything?\u0027 he said.\n \u0027Everything that you advised, O Dios,\u0027 said Koomi. He waited until most of the priests were watching them and then, in a rather louder voice, continued: \u0027If the king was here, he would intercede for us.\u0027\n He caught the eye of the priestess of Sarduk. He hadn\u0027t discussed things with her; indeed, what was there to discuss? But he had an inkling that there was some fellow, sorry, feeling there. She didn\u0027t like Dios very much, but was less in awe of him than were the others.\n \u0027I told you that the king is dead,\u0027 said Dios.\n \u0027Yes, we heard you. Yet there seems to be no body, O Dios. Nevertheless, we believe what you tell us, for it is the great Dios that speaks, and we pay no heed to malicious gossip.\u0027\n The priests were silent. Malicious gossip, too? And somebody had already mentioned rumours, hadn\u0027t they? Definitely something amiss here.\n \u0027It happened many times in the past,\u0027 said the priestess, on - cue. \u0027When a kingdom was threatened or the river did not rise, the king went to intercede with the gods. Was sent to intercede with the gods.\u0027\n The edge of satisfaction in her voice made it clear that it was a one-way trip.\n Koomi shivered with delight and horror. Oh, yes. Those were the days. Some countries had experimented with the idea of the sacrificial king, long ago. A few years of feasting and ruling, then chop - and make way for a new administration.\n \u0027In a time of crisis, possibly any high-born minister of state would suffice,\u0027 she went on.\n Dios looked up, his face mirroring the agony of his tendons.\n \u0027I see,\u0027 he said. \u0027And who would be high priest then?\u0027\n \u0027The gods would choose,\u0027 said Koomi.\n \u0027I daresay they would,\u0027 said Dios sourly. \u0027I am in some doubt as to the wisdom of their choice.\u0027\n \u0027The dead can speak to the gods in the netherworld,\u0027 said the priestess.\n \u0027But the gods are all here,\u0027 said Dios, fighting against the throbbing in his legs, which were insisting that, at this time, they should be walking along the central corridor en route to supervise the Rite of the Under Sky. His body cried out for the solace over the river. And once over the river, never to return . . . but he\u0027d always said that.\n \u0027In the absence of the king the high priest performs his duties. Isn\u0027t that right, Dios?\u0027 said Koomi.\n It was. It was written. You couldn\u0027t rewrite it, once it was written. He\u0027d written it. Long ago.\n Dios hung his head. This was worse than plumbing, this was worse than anything. And yet, and yet. . . to go across the river . . .\n \u0027Very well, then,\u0027 he said. \u0027I have one final request.\u0027\n \u0027Yes?\u0027 Koomi\u0027s voice had timbre now, it was already a high priest\u0027s voice.\n \u0027I wish to be interred in the-\u0027 Dios began, and was cut off by a murmur from those priests who could look out across the river. All eyes turned to the distant, inky shore.\n The legions of the kings of Djelibeybi were on the march. They lurched, but they covered the ground quickly. There were platoons, battalions of them. They didn\u0027t need Gern\u0027s hammer any more.\n \u0027It\u0027s the pickle,\u0027 said the king, as they watched half-a-dozen ancestors mummyhandle a seal out of its socket. \u0027It toughens you up.\u0027\n Some of the more ancient were getting over enthusiastic and attacking the pyramids themselves, actually managing to shift blocks higher than they were. The king didn\u0027t blame them. How terrible to be dead, and know you were dead, and locked away in the darkness.\n They\u0027re never going to get me in one of those things, he vowed.\n At last they came, like a tide, to yet another pyramid. - It was small, low, dark, half-concealed in drifted sands, and the blocks were hardly even masonry; they were no more than roughly squared boulders. It had clearly been built long before the Kingdom got the hang of pyramids. It was barely more than a pile.\n Hacked into the doorseal, angular and deep, were the hieroglyphs of the Kingdom: KHUFT HAD ME MADE. THE FIRST.\n Several ancestors clustered around it.\n \u0027Oh dear,\u0027 said the king. \u0027This might be going too far.\u0027\n \u0027The First,\u0027 whispered Dil. \u0027The First into the Kingdom: No-one here before but hippos and crocodiles. From inside that pyramid seventy centuries look out at us. Older than anything-\u0027\n \u0027Yes, yes, all right,\u0027 said Teppicymon. \u0027No need to get carried away. He was a man, just like all of us.\u0027\n \u0027“AndKhuftthecamelherderlookeduponthevalley. . .”\u0027 Dil began.\n \u0027After seven thousand yeares, he wyll be wantyng to look upon yt again,\u0027 said Ashk-ur-men-tep bluntly.\n \u0027Even so,\u0027 said the king. \u0027It does seem a bit . .\n \u0027The dead are equal,\u0027 said Ashk-ur-men-tep. \u0027You, younge manne. Calle hym forth.\u0027\n \u0027Who, me?\u0027 said Gern. \u0027But he was the Fir-\u0027\n \u0027Yes, we\u0027ve been through all that,\u0027 said Teppicymon. \u0027Do it. Everyone\u0027s getting impatient. So is he, I expect.\u0027\n Gern rolled his eyes, and hefted the hammer. Just as it was about to hiss down on the seal Dil darted forward, causing Gern to dance wildly across the ground in a groin-straining effort to avoid interring the hammer in his master\u0027s head.\n \u0027It\u0027s open!\u0027 said Dil. \u0027Look! The seal just swings aside!\u0027\n \u0027Youe meane he iss oute?\u0027\n Teppicymon tottered forward and grabbed the door of the pyramid. It moved quite easily. Then he examined the stone beneath it. Derelict and half-covered though it was, someone had taken care to keep a pathway clear to the pyramid. And the stone was quite worn away, as by the passage of many feet.\n This was not, by the nature of things, the normal state of affairs for a pyramid. The whole point was that once you were in, you were in.\n The mummies examined the worn entrance and creaked at one another in surprise. One of the very ancient ones, who was barely holding himself together, made a noise like deathwatch beetle finally conquering a rotten tree.\n \u0027What\u0027d he say?\u0027 said Teppicymon.\n The mummy of Ashk-ur-men-tep translated. \u0027He saide yt ys Spooky,\u0027 he croaked.\n The late king nodded. \u0027I\u0027m going in to have a look. You two live ones, you come with me.\u0027\n Dil\u0027s face fell.\n \u0027Oh, come on, man,\u0027 snapped Teppicymon, forcing the door back. \u0027Look, I\u0027m not frightened. Show a bit of backbone. Everyone else is.\u0027\n \u0027But we\u0027ll need some light,\u0027 protested Dil.\n The nearest mummies lurched back sharply as Gern timidly took a tinderbox out of his pocket.\n \u0027We\u0027ll need something to burn,\u0027 said Dil. The mummies shuffled further back, muttering.\n \u0027There\u0027s torches in here,\u0027 said Teppicymon, his voice slightly muffled. \u0027And you can keep them away from me, lad.\u0027\n It was a small pyramid, mazeless, without traps, just a stone passage leading upwards. Tremulously, expecting at any moment to see unnamed terrors leap out at them, the embalmers followed the king into a small, square chamber that smelled of sand. The roof was black with soot.\n There was no sarcophagus within, no mummy case, no terror named or nameless. The centre of the floor was occupied by a raised block, with a blanket and a pillow on it.\n Neither of them looked particularly old. It was almost disappointing.\n Gern craned to look around.\n \u0027Quite nice, really,\u0027 he said. \u0027Comfy.\u0027\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Dil.\n \u0027Hey, master king, look here,\u0027 said Gern, trotting over to one of the walls. \u0027Look. Someone\u0027s been scratching things. Look, all little lines all over the wall.\u0027\n \u0027And this wall,\u0027 said the king, \u0027and the floor. Someone\u0027s been counting. Every ten have been crossed through, you see. Someone\u0027s been counting things. Lots of things.\u0027 He stood back.\n \u0027What things?\u0027 said Dil, looking behind him.\n \u0027Very strange,\u0027 said the king. He leaned forward. \u0027You can barely make out the inscriptions underneath.\u0027\n \u0027Can you read it, king?\u0027 said Gern, showing what Dil considered to be unnecessary enthusiasm.\n \u0027No. It\u0027s one of the really ancient dialects. Can\u0027t make out a blessed hieroglyph,\u0027 said Teppicymon. \u0027I shouldn\u0027t think there\u0027s a single person alive today who can read it.\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pyramids-discworld-7/page-35.html","bookId":1626,"book":{"id":1626,"title":"Pyramids (Discworld #7)","description":"Storyline: \n Pyramids (Discworld #7) \n It\u0027s bad enough being new on the job, but Teppic hasn\u0027t a clue as to what a pharaoh is supposed to do.
