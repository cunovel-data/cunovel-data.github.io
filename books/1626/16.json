{"id":95680,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"\u0027You just said that,\u0027 said IIb.\\n\\n \u0027Said what?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027About the fresco painter. Just a moment ago.\\n\\n \u0027No, I didn\u0027t. You couldn\u0027t have been listening,\u0027 said Placlusp.\\n\\n \u0027Could have sworn you did. Anyway, this is worse than that business,\u0027 said his son. \u0027And it\u0027s probably going to happen again.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We can expect more like it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said IIb. \u0027We shouldn\u0027t get negative nodes, but it looks as though we will. We can expect fast flows and reverse flows and probably even short loops. I\u0027m afraid we can expect all kinds of temporal anomalies. We\u0027d better get the men off.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I suppose you couldn\u0027t work out a way we could get them to work in fast time and pay them for slow time?\u0027 said Ptaclusp. \u0027It\u0027s just a thought. Your brother\u0027s bound to suggest it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No! Keep everyone off! We\u0027ll get the blocks in and cap it first!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All right, all right. I was just thinking out loud. As if we didn\u0027t have enough problems . . .\u0027\\n\\n Ptaclusp waded into the cluster of workers around the centre. Here, at least, there was silence. Dead silence.\\n\\n \u0027All right, all right,\u0027 he said. \u0027What\u0027s going . . . oh.\u0027 Ptaclusp IIb peered over his father\u0027s shoulder, and stuck his wrist in his mouth.\\n\\n The thing was wrinkled. It was ancient. It clearly had once been a living thing. It lay on the slab like a very obscene prune.\\n\\n \u0027It was my lunch,\u0027 said the chief plasterer. \u0027It was my bloody lunch. I was really looking forward to that apple.\u0027 Ptaclusp hesitated. This all seemed very familiar. He\u0027d had this feeling before. An overwhelming sensation of reja vu[17]. He met the horrified gaze of his son. Together, dreading what they might see, they turned around slowly. They saw themselves standing behind themselves, bickering over something IIb was swearing that he had already heard.\\n\\n He has, too, Ptaclusp realised in dread. That\u0027s me over there. I look a lot different from the outside. And it\u0027s me over here, too. As well. Also.\\n\\n It\u0027s a loop. Just like in the river, a tiny whirlpool, only it\u0027s in the flow of time. And I\u0027ve just gone round it twice.\\n\\n The other Ptaclusp looked up at him.\\n\\n There was a long, agonising moment of temporal strain, a noise like a mouse blowing bubblegum, and the loop broke, and the figure faded.\\n\\n \u0027I know what\u0027s causing it,\u0027 muttered IIb indistinctly, because of his wrist. \u0027I know the pyramid isn\u0027t complete, but it will be, so the effects are sort of echoing backwards, dad, we ought to stop right now, it\u0027s too big, I was wrong-\\n\\n \u0027Shut up. Can you work out where the nodes will form?\u0027 said Ptaclusp. \u0027And come away over here, all the lads are staring. Pull yourself together, son.\u0027\\n\\n IIb instinctively put his hand to his belt abacus.\\n\\n \u0027Well, yes, probably,\u0027 he said. \u0027It\u0027s just a function of mass distribution and-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Right,\u0027 said the builder firmly. \u0027Start doing it. And then get all the foremen to come and see me.\u0027\\n\\n There was a glint like mica in Ptaclusp\u0027s eye. His jaw was squared like a block of granite. Maybe it\u0027s the pyramid that\u0027s got me thinking like this, he said, I\u0027m thinking fast, I know it.\\n\\n \u0027And get your brother up here, too,\u0027 he added.\\n\\n It is the pyramid effect. I\u0027m remembering an idea I\u0027m going to have.\\n\\n Best not to think too hard about that. Be practical.\\n\\n He stared around at the half-completed site. The gods knew we couldn\u0027t do it in time, he said. Now we don\u0027t have to. We can take as long as we like!\\n\\n \u0027Are you all right?\u0027 said IIb. \u0027Dad, are you all right?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Was that one of your time loops?\u0027 said Ptaclusp dreamily. What an idea! No-one would ever beat them on a contract ever again, they\u0027d win bonuses for completion and it didn\u0027t matter how long it took!\\n\\n \u0027No! Dad, we ought-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But you\u0027re sure you can work out where these loops will occur, are you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, I expect so, but-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Good.\u0027 Ptaclusp was trembling with excitement. Maybe they\u0027d have to pay the men more, but it would be worth it, and IIa would be bound to think up some sort of scheme, finance was nearly as good as magic. The lads would have to accept it. After all, they\u0027d complained about working with free men, they\u0027d complained about working with Howondanians, they\u0027d complained about working with everyone except proper paid-up Guild members. So they could hardly complain about working with themselves. IIb stepped back, and gripped the abacus for reassurance. \u0027Dad,\u0027 he said cautiously, \u0027what are you thinking about?\u0027 Ptaclusp beamed at him. \u0027Doppelgangs,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n Politics was more interesting. Teppic felt that here, at least, he could make a contribution.\\n\\n Djelibeybi was old. It was respected. But it was also small and in the sword-edged sense, which was what seemed to matter these days, had no power. It wasn\u0027t always thus, as Dios told it. Once it had ruled the world by sheer force of nobility, hardly needing the standing army of twenty-five thousand men it had in those high days.\\n\\n Now it wielded a more subtle power as a narrow state between the huge and thrusting empires of Tsort and Ephebe, each one both a threat and a shield. For more than a thousand years the kings along the Djel had, with extreme diplomacy, exquisite manners and the footwork of a centipede on adrenaline, kept the peace along the whole widdershins side of the continent. Merely having existed for seven thousand years can be a formidable weapon, if you use it properly.\\n\\n \u0027You mean we\u0027re neutral ground?\u0027 said Teppic.\\n\\n \u0027Tsort is a desert culture like us,\u0027 said Dios, steepling his hands. \u0027We have helped to shape it over the years. As for Ephebe-\u0027 He sniffed. \u0027They have some very strange beliefs.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How do you mean?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They believe the world is run by geometry, sire. All lines and angles and numbers. That sort of thing, sire-\u0027 Dios frowned - \u0027can lead to some very unsound ideas.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ah,\u0027 said Teppic, resolving to learn more about unsound ideas as soon as possible. \u0027So we\u0027re secretly on the side of Tsort, yes?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No. It is important that Ephebe remains strong.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But we\u0027ve more in common with Tsort?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So we allow them to believe, sire.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But they are a desert culture?\u0027\\n\\n Dios smiled. \u0027I am afraid they don\u0027t take pyramids seriously, sire.\u0027\\n\\n Teppic considered all this.\\n\\n \u0027So whose side are we really on?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Our own, sire. There is always a way. Always remember, sire, that your family was on its third dynasty before our neighbours had worked out, sire, how babies are made.\u0027\\n\\n The Tsort delegation did indeed appear to have studied Djeli culture assiduously, almost frantically. It was also clear that they hadn\u0027t begun to understand it; they\u0027d merely borrowed as many bits as seemed useful and then put them together in subtly wrong ways. For example, to a man they employed the Three-Turning-Walk, as portrayed on friezes, and only used by the Djeli court on certain occasions. Occasional grimaces crossed their faces as their vertebrae protested.\\n\\n They were also wearing the Khruspids of Morning and the bangles of Going Forth, as well as the kilt of Yet with, and no wonder even the maidens on fan duty were hiding their smiles, matching greaves![18]\\n\\n Even Teppic had to cough hurriedly. But then, he thought, they don\u0027t know any better. They\u0027re like children.\\n\\n And this thought was followed by another one which added, These children could wipe us off the map in one hour.\\n\\n Hot on the synapses of the other two came a third thought, which said: It\u0027s only clothes, for goodness sake, you\u0027re beginning to take it all seriously.\\n\\n The group from Ephebe were more sensibly dressed in white togas. They had a certain sameness about them, as if somewhere in the country there was a little press that stamped out small bald men with curly white beards.\\n\\n The two parties halted before the throne, and bowed.\\n\\n \u0027Halo,\u0027 said Teppic.\\n\\n \u0027His Greatness the King Teppicymon XXVIII, Lord of the Heavens, Charioteer of the Wagon of the Sun, Steersman of the Barque of the Sun, Guardian of the Secret Knowledge, Lord of the Horizon, Keeper of the Way, the Flail of Mercy, the High-Born One, the Never-Dying King, bids you welcome and commands you to take wine with him,\u0027 said Dios, clapping his hands for a butler.\\n\\n \u0027Oh yes,\u0027 said Teppic. \u0027Do sit down, won\u0027t you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027His Greatness the King Teppicymon XXVIII, Lord of the Heavens, Charioteer of the Wagon of the Sun, Steersman of the Barque of the Sun, Guardian of the Secret Knowledge, Lord of the Horizon, Keeper of the Way, the Flail of Mercy, the High-Born One, the Never-Dying King, commands you to be seated,\u0027 said Dios.\\n\\n Teppic racked his brains for a suitable speech. He\u0027d heard plenty in Ankh-Morpork. They were probably the same the whole world over.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m sure we shall get on-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027His Greatness the King Teppicymon XXVIII, Lord of the Heavens, Charioteer of the Wagon of the Sun, Steersman of the Barque of the Sun, Guardian of the Secret Knowledge, Lord of the Horizon, Keeper of the Way, the Flail of Mercy, the High-Born One, the Never-Dying King, bids you harken!\u0027 Dios boomed.\\n\\n \u0027-long history of friendship-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Harken to the wisdom of His Greatness the King Teppicymon XXVIII, Lord of the Heavens, Charioteer of the Wagon of the Sun, Steersman of the Barque of the Sun, Guardian of the Secret Knowledge, Lord of the Horizon, Keeper of the Way, the Flail of Mercy, the High-Born One, the Never-Dying King!\u0027\\n\\n The echoes died away.\\n\\n \u0027Could I have a word with you a moment, Dios?\u0027\\n\\n The high priest leaned down.\\n\\n \u0027Is all this necessary?\u0027 hissed Teppic.\\n\\n Dios\u0027s aquiline features took on the wooden expression of one who is wrestling with an unfamiliar concept.\\n\\n \u0027Of course, sire. It is traditional,\u0027 he said, at last.\\n\\n \u0027I thought I was supposed to talk to these people. You know, about boundaries and trade and so on. I\u0027ve been doing a lot of thinking about it and I\u0027ve got several ideas. I mean, it\u0027s going to be a little difficult if you\u0027re going to keep shouting.\u0027\\n\\n Dios gave him a polite smile.\\n\\n \u0027Oh no, sire. That has all been sorted out, sire. I met with them this morning.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What am I supposed to do, then?\u0027 Dios made a slight circling motion with his hand.\\n\\n \u0027Just as you wish, sire. It is normal to smile a little, and put them at their ease.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Is that all\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sire could ask them whether they enjoy being diplomats, sire,\u0027 said Dios. He met Teppic\u0027s glare with eyes as expressionless as mirrors.\\n\\n \u0027I am the king,\u0027 Teppic hissed.\\n\\n \u0027Certainly, sire. It would not do to sully the office with mere matters of leaden state, sire. Tomorrow, sire, you will be holding supreme court. A very fit office for a monarch, sire.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ah. Yes.\u0027\\n\\n It was quite complicated. Teppic listened carefully to the case, which was alleged cattle theft compounded by Djeli\u0027s onion-layered land laws. This is what it should be all about, he thought. No-one else can work out who owns the bloody ox, this is the sort of thing kings have to do. Now, let\u0027s see, five years ago, he sold the ox to him, but as it turned out-\\n\\n He looked from the face of one worried farmer to the other. They were both clutching their ragged straw hats close to their chests, and both of them wore the paralysed wooden expressions of simple men who, in pursuit of their parochial disagreement, now found themselves on a marble floor in a great room with their god enthroned before their very eyes. Teppic didn\u0027t doubt that either one would cheerfully give up all rights to the wretched creature in exchange for being ten miles away.\\n\\n It\u0027s a fairly mature ox, he thought, time it was slaughtered, even if it\u0027s his it\u0027s been fattening on his neighbour\u0027s land all these years, half each would be about right, they\u0027re really going to remember this judgement .\\n\\n He raised the Sickle of Justice.\\n\\n \u0027His Greatness the King Teppicymon XXVIII, Lord of the Heavens, Charioteer of the Wagon of the Sun, Steersman of the Barque of the Sun, Guardian of the Secret Knowledge, Lord of the Horizon, Keeper of the Way, the Flail of Mercy, the High-Born One, the Never-Dying King, will give judgement!
