If this was his posterity, he\u0027d take his chances with 600-ton limestone blocks. At least they were quiet. \u0027Shut up, the pair of you,\u0027 he said. They stopped, and sat down, grumbling. \u0027I\u0027ve made up my mind,\u0027 he said. IIb doodled fitfully with his stylus. IIa strummed his abacus. \u0027We\u0027re going to do it,\u0027 said Ptaclusp, and strode out of the room. \u0027And any son who doesn\u0027t like it will be cast into the outer darkness where there is a wailing and a crashing of teeth,\u0027 he called over his shoulder. The two brothers, left to themselves, glowered at each other. At last IIa said, \u0027What does “quantum” mean, anyway?\u0027 IIb shrugged. \u0027It means add another nought,\u0027 he said. \u0027Oh,\u0027 said IIa, \u0027is that all?\u0027 All along the river valley of the Djel the pyramids were flaring silently into the night, discharging the accumulated power of the day. Great soundless flames erupted from their capstones and danced upwards, jagged as lightning, cold as ice. For hundreds of miles the desert glittered with the constellations of the dead, the aurora of antiquity. But along the valley of the Djel the lights ran together in one solid ribbon of fire. It was on the floor and it had a pillow at one end. It had to be a bed. Teppic found he was doubting it as he tossed and turned, trying to find some part of the mattress that was prepared to meet him halfway. This is stupid, he thought, I grew up on beds like this. And pillows carved out of rock. I was born in this palace, this is my heritage, I must be prepared to accept it . . . I must order a proper bed and a feather pillow from Ankh, first thing in the morning. I, the king, have said this shall be done. He turned over, his head hitting the pillow with a thud. And plumbing. What a great idea that was. It was amazing what you could do with a hole in the ground. Yes, plumbing. And bloody doors. Teppic definitely wasn\u0027t used to having several attendants waiting on his will all the time, so performing his ablutions before bed had been extremely embarrassing. And the people, too. He was definitely going to get to know the people. It was wrong, all this skulking in palaces. And how was a fellow supposed to sleep with the sky over the river glowing like a firework? Eventually sheer exhaustion wrestled his body into some zone between sleeping and waking, and mad images stalked across his eyeballs. There was the shame of his ancestors when future archaeologists translated the as-yet unpainted frescoes of his reign: \u0027“Squiggle, constipated eagle, wiggly line, hippo\u0027s bottom, squiggle”: And in the year of the Cycle of Cephnet the Sun God Teppic had Plumbing Installed and Scorned the Pillows of his Forebears.\u0027 He dreamed of Khuft - huge, bearded, speaking in thunder and lightning, calling down the wrath of the heavens on this descendant who was betraying the noble past. Dios floated past his vision, explaining that as a result of an edict passed several thousand years ago it was essential that he marry a cat. Various-headed gods vied for his attention, explaining details of godhood, while in the background a distant voice tried to attract his attention and screamed something about not wanting to be buried under a load of stone. But he had no time to concentrate on this, because he saw seven fat cows and seven thin cows, one of them playing a trombone. But that was an old dream, he dreamt that one nearly every night. And then there was a man firing arrows at a tortoise . . . And then he was walking over the desert and found a tiny pyramid, only a few inches high. A wind sprang up and blew away the sand, only now it wasn\u0027t a wind, it was the pyramid rising, sand tumbling down its gleaming sides . And it grew bigger and bigger, bigger than the world, so that at last the pyramid was so big that the whole world was a speck in the centre. And in the centre of the pyramid, something very strange happened. And the pyramid grew smaller, taking the world with it. and vanished . . . Of course, when you\u0027re a pharaoh, you get a very high class of obscure dream. Another day dawned, courtesy of the king, who was curled up on the bed and using his rolled-up clothes as a pillow. Around the stone maze of the palace the servants of the kingdom began to wake up. Dios\u0027s boat slid gently through the water and bumped into the jetty. Dios climbed out and hurried into the palace, bounding up the steps three at a time and rubbing his hands together at the thought of a fresh day laid out before him, every hour and ritual ticking neatly into place. So much to organise, so much to be needed for . . . The chief sculptor and maker of mummy cases folded up his measure. \u0027You done a good job there, Master Dil,\u0027 he said. Dil nodded. There was no false modesty between craftsmen. The sculptor gave him a nudge. \u0027What a team, eh?\u0027 he said. \u0027You pickle \u0027em, I crate \u0027em.\u0027 Dil nodded, but rather more slowly. The sculptor looked down at the wax oval in his hands. \u0027Can\u0027t say I think much of the death mask, mind,\u0027 he said. Gern, who was working hard on the corner slab on one of the Queen\u0027s late cats, which he had been allowed to do all by himself, looked up in horror. \u0027I done it very careful,\u0027 he said sulkily. \u0027That\u0027s the whole point,\u0027 said the sculptor. \u0027I know,\u0027 said Dil sadly, \u0027it\u0027s the nose, isn\u0027t it.\u0027 \u0027It was more the chin.\u0027 \u0027And the chin.\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 They looked in gloomy silence at the waxen visage of the pharaoh. So did the pharaoh. \u0027Nothing wrong with my chin.\u0027 \u0027You could put a beard on it,\u0027 said Dil eventually. \u0027It\u0027d cover a lot of it, would a beard.\u0027 \u0027There\u0027s still the nose.\u0027 \u0027You could take half an inch off that. And do something with the cheekbones.\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 Gern was horrified. \u0027That\u0027s the face of our late king you\u0027re talking about,\u0027 he said. \u0027You can\u0027t do that sort of thing! Anyway, people would notice.\u0027 He hesitated. \u0027Wouldn\u0027t they?\u0027 The two craftsmen eyed one another. \u0027Gern,\u0027 said Dil patiently, \u0027certainly they\u0027ll notice. But they won\u0027t say anything. They expect us to, er, improve matters.\u0027 \u0027After all,\u0027 said the chief sculptor cheerfully, \u0027you don\u0027t think they\u0027re going to step up and say “It\u0027s all wrong, he really had a face like a short-sighted chicken”, do you?\u0027 \u0027Thank you very much. Thank you very much indeed, I must say.\u0027 The pharaoh went and sat by the cat. It seemed that people only had respect for the dead when they thought the dead were listening. \u0027I suppose,\u0027 said the apprentice, with some uncertainty, \u0027he did look a bit ugly compared to the frescoes.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s the point, isn\u0027t it,\u0027 said Dil meaningfully. Gern\u0027s big honest spotty face changed slowly, like a cratered landscape with clouds passing across it. It was dawning on him that this came under the heading of initiation into ancient craft secrets. \u0027You mean even the painters change the-\u0027 he began. Dil frowned at him. \u0027We don\u0027t talk about it,\u0027 he said. Gern tried to force his features into an expression of worthy seriousness. \u0027Oh,\u0027 he said. \u0027Yes. I see, master.\u0027 The sculptor clapped him on the back. \u0027You\u0027re a bright lad, Gern,\u0027 he said. \u0027You catch on. After all, it\u0027s bad enough being ugly when you\u0027re alive. Think how terrible it would be to be ugly in the netherworld.\u0027 King Teppicymon XXVII shook his head. We all have to look alike when we\u0027re alive, he thought, and now they make sure we\u0027re identical when we\u0027re dead. What a kingdom. He looked down and saw the soul of the late cat, which was washing itself. When he was alive he\u0027d hated the things, but just now it seemed positively companionable. He patted it gingerly on its flat head. It purred for a moment, and then attempted to strip the flesh from his hand. It was on a definite hiding to nothing there. He was aware with growing horror that the trio was now discussing a pyramid. His pyramid. It was going to be the biggest one ever. It was going to go on a highly fertile piece of sloping ground on a prime site in the necropolis. It was going to make even the biggest existing pyramid look like something a child might construct in a sand tray. It was going to be surrounded by marble gardens and granite obelisks. It was going to be the greatest memorial ever built by a son for his father. The king groaned. Ptaclusp groaned. It had been better in his father\u0027s day. You just needed a bloody great heap of log rollers and twenty years, which was useful because it kept everyone out of trouble during Inundation, when all the fields were flooded. Now you just needed a bright lad with a piece of chalk and the right incantations. Mind you, it was impressive, if you liked that kind of thing. Ptaclusp IIb walked around the great stone block, tidying an equation here, highlighting a hermetic inscription there. He glanced up and gave his father a brief nod. Ptaclusp hurried back to the king, who was standing with his retinue on the cliff overlooking the quarry, the sun gleaming off the mask. A royal visit, on top of everything else \u0027We\u0027re ready, if it please you, O arc of the sky,\u0027 he said, breaking into a sweat, hoping against hope that Oh gods. The king was going to Put Him at his Ease again. He looked imploringly at the high priest, who with the merest twitch of his features indicated that there was nothing he proposed to do about it. This was too much, he wasn\u0027t the only one to object to this, Dil the master embalmer had been subjected to half an hour of having to Talk about his Family only yesterday, it was wrong, people expected the king to stay in the palace, it was too . . . The king ambled towards him in a nonchalant way designed to make the master builder feel he was among friends. Oh no, Ptaclusp thought, he\u0027s going to Remember my Name. \u0027I must say you\u0027ve done a tremendous amount in nine weeks, it\u0027s a very good start. Er. It\u0027s Ptaclusp, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 said the king. Ptaclusp swallowed. There was no help for it now. \u0027Yes, O hand upon the waters,\u0027 he said, \u0027O fount of-\u0027 \u0027I think “your majesty” or “sire” will do,\u0027 said Teppic. Ptaclusp panicked and glanced fearfully at Dios, who winced but nodded again. \u0027The king wishes you to address him-\u0027 a look of pain crossed his face - \u0027informally. In the fashion of the barba - of foreign lands.\u0027 \u0027You must consider yourself a very fortunate man to have such talented and hard-working sons,\u0027 said Teppic, staring down at the busy panorama of the quarry. \u0027I . . . will, O . . . sire,\u0027 mumbled Ptaclusp, interpreting this as an order. Why couldn\u0027t kings order people around like in the old days? You knew where you were then, they didn\u0027t go round being charming and treating you as some sort of equal, as if you could make the sun rise too. \u0027It must be a fascinating trade,\u0027 Teppic went on. \u0027As your sire wishes, sire,\u0027 said Ptaclusp. \u0027If your majesty would just give the word-\u0027 \u0027And how exactly does all this work?\u0027 \u0027Your sire?\u0027 said Ptaclusp, horrified. \u0027You make the blocks fly, do you?\u0027 \u0027Yes, O sire.\u0027 \u0027That is very interesting. How do you do it?\u0027 Ptaclusp nearly bit through his lip. Betray Craft secrets? He was horrified. Against all expectation, Dios came to his aid. \u0027By means of certain secret signs and sigils, sire,\u0027 he said, \u0027into the origin of which it is not wise to inquire. It is the wisdom of-\u0027 he paused \u0027-the modems.\u0027 \u0027So much quicker than all that heaving stuff around, I expect,\u0027 said Teppic. \u0027It had a certain glory, sire,\u0027 said Dios. \u0027Now, if I may suggest . . . \u0027Oh. Yes. Press on, by all means.\u0027 Ptaclusp wiped his forehead, and ran to the edge of the quarry.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pyramids-discworld-7/page-14.html","bookId":1626,"book":{"id":1626,"title":"Pyramids (Discworld #7)","description":"Storyline: Pyramids (Discworld #7) It\u0027s bad enough being new on the job, but Teppic hasn\u0027t a clue as to what a pharaoh is supposed to do.
