{"id":95677,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"Over the millennia the fashions had fluctuated. Later pyramids were smooth and sharp, or flattened and tiled with mica. Even the steepest of them, Teppic mused, wouldn\u0027t rate more than 1.O on any edificeer\u0027s scale, although some of the stelae and temples, which flocked around the base of the pyramids like tugboats around the dreadnoughts of eternity, could be worthy of attention.\\n\\n Dreadnoughts of eternity, he thought, sailing ponderously through the mists of Time with every passenger travelling first class . . .\\n\\n A few stars had been let out early. Teppic looked up at them. Perhaps, he thought, there is life somewhere else. On the stars, maybe. If it\u0027s true that there are billions of universes stacked alongside one another, the thickness of a thought apart, then there must be people elsewhere.\\n\\n But wherever they are, no matter how mightily they try, no matter how magnificent the effort, they surely can\u0027t manage to be as godawfully stupid as us. I mean, we work at it. We were given a spark of it to start with, but over hundreds of thousands of years we\u0027ve really improved on it.\\n\\n He turned to Dios, feeling that he ought to repair a little bit of the damage.\\n\\n \u0027You can feel the age radiating off them, can\u0027t you,\u0027 he said conversationally.\\n\\n \u0027Pardon, sire?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The pyramids, Dios. They\u0027re so old.\u0027\\n\\n Dios glanced vaguely across the river. \u0027Are they?\u0027 he said. \u0027Yes, I suppose they are.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Will you get one?\u0027 said Teppic.\\n\\n \u0027A pyramid?\u0027 said Dios. \u0027Sire, I have one already. It pleased one of your forebears to make provision for me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That must have been a great honour,\u0027 said Teppic. Dios nodded graciously. The staterooms of forever were usually reserved for royalty.\\n\\n \u0027It is, of course, very small. Very plain. But it will suffice for my simple needs.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Will it?\u0027 said Teppic, yawning. \u0027That\u0027s nice. And now, if you don\u0027t mind, I think I\u0027ll turn in. It\u0027s been a long day.\u0027\\n\\n Dios bowed as though he was hinged in the middle. Teppic had noticed that Dios had at least fifty finely-tuned ways of bowing, each one conveying subtle shades of meaning. This one looked like No.3, I Am Your Humble Servant.\\n\\n \u0027And a very good day it was too, if I may say so, sire. Teppic was lost for words. \u0027You thought so?\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027The cloud effects at dawn were particularly effective.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They were? Oh. Do I have to do anything about the sunset?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Your majesty is pleased to joke,\u0027 said Dios. \u0027Sunsets happen by themselves, sire. Haha.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Haha,\u0027 echoed Teppic.\\n\\n Dios cracked his knuckles. \u0027The trick is in the sunrise,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n The crumbling scrolls of Knot said that the great orange sun was eaten every evening by the sky goddess, What, who saved one pip in time to grow a fresh sun for next morning. And Dios knew that this was so.\\n\\n The Book of Staying in The Pit said that the sun was the Eye of Yay, toiling across the sky each day in His endless search for his toenails.[14] And Dios knew that this was so.\\n\\n The secret rituals of the Smoking Mirror held that the sun was in fact a round hole in the spinning blue soap bubble of the goddess Nesh, opening into the fiery real world beyond, and the stars were the holes that the rain comes through. And Dios knew that this, also, was so.\\n\\n Folk myth said the sun was a ball of fire which circled the world every day, and that the world itself was carried through the everlasting void on the back of an enormous turtle. And Dios also knew that this was so, although it gave him a bit of trouble.\\n\\n And Dios knew that Net was the Supreme God, and that Fon was the Supreme God, and so were Hast, Set, Bin, Sot, Ic, Dhek, and Ptooie; that Herpetine Triskeles alone ruled the world of the dead, and so did Syncope, and Silur the Catfish-Headed God, and Orexis-Nupt.\\n\\n Dios was maximum high priest to a national religion that had fermented and accreted and bubbled for more than seven thousand years and never threw a god away in case it turned out to be useful. He knew that a great many mutually-contradictory things were all true. If they were not, then ritual and belief were as nothing, and if they were nothing, then the world did not exist. As a result of this sort of thinking, the priests of the Djel could give mind room to a collection of ideas that would make even a quantum mechanic give in and hand back his toolbox.\\n\\n Dios\u0027s staff knocked echoes from the stones as he limped along in the darkness down little-frequented passages until he emerged on a small jetty. Untying the boat there, the high priest climbed in with difficulty, unshipped the oars and pushed himself out into the turbid waters of the dark Djel.\\n\\n His hands and feet felt too cold. Foolish, foolish. He should have done this before.\\n\\n The boat jerked slowly into midstream as full night rolled over the valley. On the far bank, in response to the ancient laws, the pyramids started to light the sky.\\n\\n Lights also burned late in the house of Ptaclusp Associates, Necropolitan Builders to the Dynasties. The father and his twin Sons were hunched over the huge wax designing tray, arguing.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s not as if they ever pay,\u0027 said Ptaclusp IIa. \u0027I mean it\u0027s not just a case of not being able to, they don\u0027t seem to have grasped the idea. At least dynasties like Tsort pay up within a hundred years or so. Why didn\u0027t you-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027ve built pyramids along the Djel for the last three thousand years,\u0027 said his father stiffly, \u0027and we haven\u0027t lost by it, have we? No, we haven\u0027t. Because the other kingdoms look to the Djel, they say there\u0027s a family that really knows its pyramids, connysewers, they say we\u0027ll have what they\u0027re having, if you please, with knobs on. Anyway, they\u0027re real royalty,\u0027 he added, \u0027not like some of the ones you get these days - here today, gone next millennium. They\u0027re half gods, too. You don\u0027t expect real royalty to pay its way. That\u0027s one of the signs of real royalty, not having any money.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You don\u0027t get more royal than them, then. You\u0027d need a new word,\u0027 said IIa. We\u0027re nearly royal in that case.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You don\u0027t understand business, my son. You think it\u0027s all book-keeping. Well, it isn\u0027t.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s a question of mass. And the power to weight ratio.\u0027 They both glared at Ptaclusp IIb, who was sitting staring at the sketches. He was turning his stylus over and over in his hands, which were trembling with barely-suppressed excitement.\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027ll have to use granite for the lower slopes,\u0027 he said, talking to himself, \u0027the limestone wouldn\u0027t take it. Not with all the power flows. Which will be, whooeee, they\u0027ll be big. I mean we\u0027re not talking razor blades here. This thing could put an edge on a rolling pin.\u0027\\n\\n Ptaclusp rolled his eyes. He was only one generation into a dynasty and already it was trouble. One son a born accountant, the other in love with this new-fangled cosmic engineering. There hadn\u0027t been any such thing when he was a lad, there was just architecture. You drew the plans, and then got in ten thousand lads on time-and-a-half and double bubble at weekends. They just had to pile the stuff up. You didn\u0027t have to be cosmic about it.\\n\\n Descendants! The gods had seen fit to give him one son who charged you for the amount of breath expended in saying \u0027Good morning\u0027, and another one who worshipped geometry and stayed up all night designing aqueducts. You scrimped and saved to send them to the best schools, and then they went and paid you back by getting educated.\\n\\n \u0027What are you talking about?\u0027 he snapped.\\n\\n \u0027The discharge alone . . .\u0027 He pulled his abacus towards him and rattled the pottery beads along the wires. \u0027Let\u0027s say we\u0027re talking twice the height of the Executive model, which gives us a mass of. . . plus additional coded dimensions of occult significance as per spec. . . we couldn\u0027t do this sort of thing even a hundred years ago, you realise, not with the primitive techniques we had then...\u0027 His finger became a blur.\\n\\n IIa gave a snort and grabbed his own abacus.\\n\\n \u0027Limestone at two talents the ton. . .\u0027 he said. \u0027Wear and tear on tools . . . masonry charges . . . demurrage . . . breakages . . . oh dear, oh dear . . . on-cost . . . black marble at replacement prices . . .\u0027\\n\\n Ptaclusp sighed. Two abaci rattling in tandem the whole day long, one changing the shape of the world and the other one deploring the cost. Whatever happened to the two bits of wood and a plumbline?\\n\\n The last beads clicked against the stops.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027d be a whole quantum leap in pyramidology,\u0027 said IIb, sitting back with a messianic grin on his face.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027d be a whole kwa-\u0027 IIa began.\\n\\n \u0027Quantum,\u0027 said IIb, savouring the word.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027d be a whole quantum leap in bankruptcy,\u0027 said IIa.\\n\\n \u0027They\u0027d have to invent a new word for that too.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027d be worth it as a loss leader,\u0027 said IIb.\\n\\n \u0027Sure enough. When it comes to making a loss, we\u0027ll be in the lead,\u0027 said IIa sourly.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027d practically glow! In millennia to come people will look at it and say “That Ptaclusp, he knew his pyramids all right”.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They\u0027ll call it Ptaclusp\u0027s Folly, you mean!\u0027\\n\\n By now the brothers were both standing up, their noses a few inches apart.\\n\\n \u0027The trouble with you, sibling, is that you know the cost of everything and the value of nothing!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The trouble with you is - is - is that you don\u0027t!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Mankind must strive ever upwards!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, on a sound financial footing, by Khuft!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The search for knowledge-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The search for probity-\u0027\\n\\n Ptaclusp left them to it and stood staring out at the yard, where, under the glow of torches, the staff were doing a feverish stocktaking.\\n\\n It\u0027d been a small business when father passed it on to him - just a yard full of blocks and various sphinxes, needles, steles and other stock items, and a thick stack of unpaid bills, most of them addressed to the palace and respectfully pointing out that our esteemed account presented nine hundred years ago appeared to have been overlooked and prompt settlement would oblige. But it had been fun in those days. There was just him, five thousand labourers, and Mrs Ptaclusp doing the books.\\n\\n You had to do pyramids, dad said. All the profit was in mastabas, small family tombs, memorial needles and general jobbing necropoli, but if you didn\u0027t do pyramids, you didn\u0027t do anything. The meanest garlic farmer, looking for something neat and long lasting with maybe some green marble chippings but within a budget, wouldn\u0027t go to a man without a pyramid to his name.\\n\\n So he\u0027d done pyramids, and they\u0027d been good ones, not like some you saw these days, with the wrong number of sides and walls you could put your foot through. And yes, somehow they\u0027d gone from strength to strength.\\n\\n To build the biggest pyramid ever..\\n\\n In three months.\\n\\n With terrible penalties if it wasn\u0027t done on time. Dios hadn\u0027t specified how terrible, but Ptaclusp knew his man and they probably involved crocodiles. They\u0027d be pretty terrible, all right...\\n\\n He stared at the flickering light on the long avenues of statues, including the one of bloody Hat the Vulture-Headed God of Unexpected Guests, bought on the offchance years ago and turned down by the client owing to not being up to snuff in the beak department and unshiftable ever since even at a discount.\\n\\n The biggest pyramid ever . . .\\n\\n And after you\u0027d knocked your pipes out seeing to it that the nobility had their tickets to eternity, were you allowed to turn your expertise homeward, i.e., a bijou pyramidette for self and Mrs Ptaclusp, to ensure safe delivery into the Netherworld? Of course not. Even dad had only been allowed to have a mastaba, although it was one of the best on the river, he had to admit, that red-veined marble had been ordered all the way from Howonderland, a lot of people had asked for the same, it had been good for business, that\u0027s how dad would have liked it. . .\\n\\n The biggest pyramid ever . . .\\n\\n And they\u0027d never remember who was under it.\\n\\n It didn\u0027t matter if they called it Ptaclusp\u0027s Folly or Ptaclusp\u0027s Glory. They\u0027d call it Ptaclusp\u0027s. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pyramids-discworld-7/page-13.html","bookId":1626,"book":{"id":1626,"title":"Pyramids (Discworld #7)","description":"Storyline: Pyramids (Discworld #7) \\n It\u0027s bad enough being new on the job, but Teppic hasn\u0027t a clue as to what a pharaoh is supposed to do.
