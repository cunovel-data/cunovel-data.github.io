They watched her fingers.\\n\\n \u0027And thus,\u0027 she said, \u0027let us consider the position before the founding of the Guild. In this city, and indeed in many places elsewhere, civilisation is nurtured and progresses by the dynamic interplay of interests among many large and powerful advantage cartels.\\n\\n \u0027In the days before the founding of the Guild the seeking of advancement among these consortia invariably resulted in regrettable disagreements which were terminated with extreme prejudice. These were extremely deleterious to the common interest of the city. Please understand that where disharmony rules, commerce flags.\\n\\n \u0027And yet, and yet.\u0027 She clasped her hands to her bosom. There was a creak like a galleon beating against a gale.\\n\\n \u0027Clearly there was a need for an extreme yet responsible means of settling irreconcilable differences,\u0027 she went on, \u0027and thus was laid the groundwork for the Guild. What bliss - \u0027 the sudden peak in her voice guiltily jerked several dozen young men out of their private reveries - \u0027it must have been to have been present in those early days, when men of stout moral purpose set out to forge the ultimate political tool short of warfare. How fortunate you are now, in training for a guild which demands so much in terms of manners, deportment, bearing and esoteric skills, and yet offers a power once the preserve only of the gods. Truly, the world is the mollusc of your choice . . .\\n\\n Chidder translated much of this behind the stables during the dinner break.\\n\\n \u0027I know what Terminate with Extreme Prejudice means,\u0027 said Cheesewright loftily. \u0027It means to inhume with an axe.\\n\\n \u0027It bloody well doesn\u0027t,\u0027 said Chidder.\\n\\n \u0027How do you know, then?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027My family have been in commerce for years,\u0027 said Chidder.\\n\\n \u0027Huh,\u0027 said Cheesewright. \u0027Commerce.\u0027\\n\\n Chidder never went into details about what kind of commerce it was. It had something to do with moving items around and supplying needs, but exactly what items and which needs was never made clear.\\n\\n After hitting Cheesewright he explained carefully that Terminate with Extreme Prejudice did not simply require that the victim was inhumed, preferably in an extremely thorough way, but that his associates and employees were also intimately involved, along with the business premises, the building, and a large part of the surrounding neighbourhood, so that everyone involved would know that the man had been unwise enough to make the kind of enemies who could get very angry and indiscriminate.\\n\\n \u0027Gosh,\u0027 said Arthur.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, that\u0027s nothing,\u0027 said Chidder, \u0027one Hogswatchnight my grandad and his accounts department went and had a high-level business conference with the Hubside people and fifteen bodies were never found. Very bad, that sort of thing. Upsets the business community.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All the business community, or just that part of it floating face down in the river?\u0027 said Teppic.\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s the point. Better it should be like this,\u0027 said Chidder, shaking his head. \u0027You know. Clean. That\u0027s why my father said I should join the Guild. I mean, you\u0027ve got to get on with the business these days, you can\u0027t spend your whole time on public relations.\u0027\\n\\n The end of the crossbow trembled.\\n\\n He liked everything else about the school, the climbing, the music studies, the broad education. It was the fact that you ended up killing people that had been preying on his mind. He\u0027d never killed anyone.\\n\\n That\u0027s the whole point, he told himself. This is where everyone finds out if you can, including you.\\n\\n If I get it wrong now, I\u0027m dead.\\n\\n In his corner, Mericet began to hum a discouraging little tune.\\n\\n There was a price the Guild paid for its licence. It saw to it that there were no careless, half-hearted or, in a manner of speaking, murderously inefficient assassins. You never met anyone who\u0027d failed the test.\\n\\n People did fail. You just never met them. Maybe there was one under there, maybe it was Chidder, even, or Snoxall or any one of the lads. They were all doing the run this evening. Maybe if he failed he\u0027d be bundled under there.\\n\\n Teppic tried to sight on the recumbent figure.\\n\\n \u0027Ahem,\u0027 coughed the examiner.\\n\\n His throat was dry. Panic rose like a drunkard\u0027s supper.\\n\\n His teeth wanted to chatter. His spine was freezing, his clothes a collection of damp rags. The world slowed down. No. He wasn\u0027t going to. The sudden decision hit him like a brick in a dark alley, and was nearly as surprising. It wasn\u0027t that he hated the Guild, or even particularly disliked Mericet, but this wasn\u0027t the way to test anyone. It was just wrong.\\n\\n He decided to fail. Exactly what could the old man do about it, here?\\n\\n And he\u0027d fail with flair.\\n\\n He turned to face Mericet, looked peacefully into the examiner\u0027s eyes, extended his crossbow hand in some vague direction to his right, and pulled the trigger.\\n\\n There was a metallic twang.\\n\\n There was a click as the bolt ricocheted off a nail in the window sill. Mericet ducked as it whirred over his head. It hit a torch bracket on the wall, and went past Teppic\u0027s white face purring like a maddened cat.\\n\\n There was a thud as it hit the blanket, and then silence.\\n\\n \u0027Thank you, Mr Teppic. If you could bear with me just one moment.\u0027\\n\\n The old assassin pored over his clipboard, his lips moving. He took the pencil, which dangled from it by a bit of frayed string, and made a few marks on a piece of pink paper.\\n\\n \u0027I will not ask you to take it from my hands,\u0027 he said, \u0027what with one thing and another. I shall leave it on the table by the door.\u0027\\n\\n It wasn\u0027t a particularly pleasant smile: it was thin and dried-up, a smile with all the warmth long ago boiled out of it; people normally smiled like that when they had been dead for about two years under the broiling desert sun. But at least you felt he was making the effort.\\n\\n Teppic hadn\u0027t moved. \u0027I\u0027ve passed?\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027That would appear to be the case.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I am sure you know that we are not allowed to discuss the test with pupils. However, I can tell you that I personally do not approve of these modern flashy techniques. Good morning to you.\u0027 And Mericet stalked out.\\n\\n Teppic tottered over to the dusty table by the door and looked down, horrified, at the paper. Sheer habit made him extract a pair of tweezers from his pouch in order to pick it up.\\n\\n It was genuine enough. There was the seal of the Guild on it, and the crabbed squiggle that was undoubtedly Mericet\u0027s signature; he\u0027d seen it often enough, generally at the bottom of test papers alongside comments like 3/10. See me.\\n\\n He padded over to the figure on the bed and pulled back the blanket.\\n\\n It was nearly one in the morning. Ankh-Morpork was just beginning to make a night of it.\\n\\n It had been dark up above the rooftops, in the aerial world of thieves and assassins. But down below the life of the city flowed through the streets like a tide.\\n\\n Teppic walked through the throng in a daze. Anyone else who tried that in the city was asking for a guided tour of the bottom of the river, but he was wearing assassin\u0027s black and the crowd just automatically opened in front of him and closed behind. Even the pickpockets kept away. You never knew what you might find. He wandered aimlessly through the gates of the Guild House and sat down on a black marble seat, with his chin on his knuckles.\\n\\n The fact was that his life had come to an end. He hadn\u0027t thought about what was going to happen next. He hadn\u0027t dared to think that there was going to be a next.\\n\\n Someone tapped him on the shoulder. As he turned, Chidder sat down beside him and wordlessly produced a slip of pink paper.\\n\\n \u0027Snap,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027You passed too?\u0027 said Teppic.\\n\\n Chidder grinned. \u0027No problem,\u0027 he said. \u0027It was Nivor. No problem. He gave me a bit of trouble on the Emergency Drop, though. How about you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hmm? Oh. No.\u0027 Teppic tried to get a grip on himself. \u0027No trouble,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027Heard from any of the others?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No.\u0027\\n\\n Chidder leaned back. \u0027Cheesewright will make it,\u0027 he said loftily, \u0027and young Arthur. I don\u0027t think some of the others will. We could give them twenty minutes, what do you say?\u0027\\n\\n Teppic turned an agonised face towards him.\\n\\n \u0027Chiddy, I-\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027When it came to it, I-\\n\\n \"What about it?\u0027\\n\\n Teppic looked at the cobbles. \u0027Nothing,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re lucky - you just had a good airy run over the rooftops. I had the sewers and then up the garderobe in the Haberdashers\u0027 Tower. I had to go in and change when I got here.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You had a dummy, did you?\u0027 said Teppic.\\n\\n \u0027Good grief, didn\u0027t you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But they let us think it was going to be real!\u0027 Teppic wailed.\\n\\n \u0027It felt real, didn\u0027t it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, then. And you passed. So no problem.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But didn\u0027t you wonder who might be under the blanket, who it was, and why-\\n\\n \u0027I was worried that I might not do it properly,\u0027 Chidder admitted. \u0027But then I thought, well, it\u0027s not up to me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But I- \u0027 Teppic stopped. What could he do? Go and explain? Somehow that didn\u0027t seem a terribly good idea.\\n\\n His friend slapped him on the back.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t worry about it!\u0027 he said. \u0027We\u0027ve done it!\u0027\\n\\n And Chidder held up his thumb pressed against the first two fingers of his right hand, in the ancient salute of the assassins.\\n\\n A thumb pressed against two fingers, and the lean figure of Dr Cruces, head tutor, looming over the startled boys. \u0027We do not murder,\u0027 he said. It was a soft voice; the doctor never raised his voice, but he had a way of giving it the pitch and spin that could make it be heard through a hurricane. \u0027We do not execute. We do not massacre. We never, you may be very certain, we never torture. We have no truck with crimes of passion or hatred or pointless gain. We do not do it for a delight in inhumation, or to feed some secret inner need, or for petty advantage or for some cause or belief; I tell you, gentlemen, that all these reasons are in the highest degree suspect. Look into the face of a man who will kill you for a belief and your nostrils will snuff up the scent of abomination. Hear a speech declaring a holy war and, I assure you, your ears should catch the click of evil\u0027s scales and the dragging of its monstrous tail over the purity of the language.\\n\\n \u0027No, we do it for the money.\\n\\n \u0027And, because we above all must know the value of a human life, we do it for the a great deal of money.\\n\\n \u0027There can be few cleaner motives, so shorn of all pretence.\\n\\n \u0027Nil mortifi, sine lucre. Remember. No killing without payment.\u0027\\n\\n He paused for a moment.\\n\\n \u0027And always give a reciept,\u0027 he added.\\n\\n \u0027So it\u0027s all okay,\u0027 said Chidder. Teppic nodded gloomily. That was what was so likeable about Chidder. He had this enviable ability to avoid thinking seriously about anything he did.\\n\\n A figure approached cautiously through the open gates.[7]\\n\\n The light from the torch in the porters\u0027 lodge glinted off blond curly hair.\\n\\n \u0027You two made it, then,\u0027 said Arthur, nonchalantly flourishing the slip.\\n\\n Arthur had changed quite a lot in seven years. The continuing failure of the Great Orm to wreak organic revenge for lack of piety had cured him of his tendency to run everywhere with his coat over his head. His small size gave him a natural advantage in those areas of the craft involving narrow spaces. His innate aptitude for channelled violence had been revealed on the day when Fliemoe and some cronies had decided it would be fun to toss the new boys in a blanket, and picked Arthur first; ten seconds later it had taken the combined efforts of every boy in the dormitory to hold Arthur back and prise the remains of the chair from his fingers. It had transpired that he was the son of the late Johan Ludorum, one of the greatest assasins in the history of the Guild. Sons of dead assasins always got a free scholarship. Yes, it could be a caring profession at times. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pyramids-discworld-7/page-6.html","bookId":1626,"book":{"id":1626,"title":"Pyramids (Discworld #7)","description":"Storyline: Pyramids (Discworld #7) \\n It\u0027s bad enough being new on the job, but Teppic hasn\u0027t a clue as to what a pharaoh is supposed to do.
