With a figure like that and a mind like . . .\u0027 He hesitated. \u0027Is she . . . ? I mean, are you two . . .\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Teppic.\n \u0027She\u0027s very attractive.\u0027\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Teppic.\n \u0027A sort of cross between a temple dancer and a bandsaw.\u0027 They took their glasses and went up on deck, where a few lights from the city paled against the brilliance of the stars. The water was flat calm, almost oily.\n Teppic\u0027s head was beginning to spin slowly. The desert, the sun, two gloss coats of Ephebian retsina on his stomach lining and a bottle of wine were getting together to beat up his synapses.\n \u0027I mus\u0027 say,\u0027 he managed, leaning on the rail, \u0027you\u0027re doing all right for yourself.\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s okay,\u0027 said Chidder. \u0027Commerce is quite interesting. Building up markets, you know. The cut and thrust of competition in the privateering sector. You ought to come in with us, boy. It\u0027s where the future lies, my father says. Not with wizards and kings, but with enterprising people who can afford to hire them. No offence intended, you understand.\u0027\n \u0027We\u0027re all that\u0027s left,\u0027 said Teppic to his wine glass. \u0027Out of the whole kingdom. Me, her, and a camel that smells like an old carpet. An ancient kingdom, lost.\u0027\n \u0027Good job it wasn\u0027t a new one,\u0027 said Chidder. \u0027At least people got some wear out of it.\u0027\n \u0027You don\u0027t know what it\u0027s like,\u0027 said Teppic. \u0027It\u0027s like a whole great pyramid. But upside down, you understand? All that history, all those ancestors, all the people, all funnelling down to me. Right at the bottom.\u0027\n He slumped on to a coil of rope as Chidder passed the bottle back and said, \u0027It makes you think, doesn\u0027t it? There\u0027s all these lost cities and kingdoms around. Like Ee, in the Great Nef. Whole countries, just gone. Just out there somewhere. Maybe people started mucking about with geometry, what do you say?\u0027\n Teppic snored.\n After some moments Chidder swayed forward, dropped the empty bottle over the side, it went plunk - and for a few seconds a stream of bubbles disturbed the flat calm - and staggered off to bed.\n Teppic dreamed.\n And in his dream he was standing on a high place, but unsteadily, because he was balancing on the shoulders of his father and mother, and below them he could make out his grandparents, and below them his ancestors stretching away and out in a vast, all right, a vast pyramid of humanity whose base was lost in clouds.\n He could hear the murmur of shouted orders and instructions floating up to him.\n If you do nothing, we shall never have been.\n \u0027This is just a dream,\u0027 he said, and stepped out of it into a palace where a small, dark man in a loincloth was sitting on a stone bench, eating figs.\n \u0027Of course it\u0027s a dream,\u0027 he said. \u0027The world is the dream of the Creator. It\u0027s all dreams, different kinds of dreams. They\u0027re supposed to tell you things. Like: don\u0027t eat lobster last thing at night. Stuff like that. Have you had the one about the seven cows?\u0027\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Teppic, looking around. He\u0027d dreamed quite good architecture. \u0027One of them was playing a trombone.\u0027\n \u0027It was smoking a cigar in my day. Well-known ancestral dream, that dream.\u0027\n \u0027What does it mean?\u0027\n The little man picked a seed from between his teeth.\n \u0027Search me,\u0027 he said. \u0027I\u0027d give my right arm to find out. I don\u0027t think we\u0027ve met, by the way. I\u0027m Khuft. I founded this kingdom. You dream a good fig.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m dreaming you, too?\u0027\n \u0027Damn right. I had a vocabulary of eight hundred words, do you think I\u0027d really be talking like this? If you\u0027re expecting a bit of helpful ancestral advice, forget it. This is a dream. I can\u0027t tell you anything you don\u0027t know yourself.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re the founder?\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s me.\u0027\n \u0027I . . . thought you\u0027d be different,\u0027 said Teppic.\n \u0027How d\u0027you mean?\u0027\n \u0027Well . . . on the statue . .\n Khuft waved a hand impatiently.\n \u0027That\u0027s just public relations,\u0027 he said. \u0027I mean, look at me. Do I look patriarchal?\u0027\n Teppic gave him a critical appraisal. \u0027Not in that loincloth,\u0027 he admitted. \u0027It\u0027s a bit, well, ragged.\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s got years of wear left in it,\u0027 said Khuft.\n \u0027Still, I expect it\u0027s all you could grab when you were fleeing from persecution,\u0027 said Teppic, anxious to show an understanding nature.\n Khuft took another fig and give him a lopsided look. \u0027How\u0027s that again?\u0027\n \u0027You were being persecuted,\u0027 said Teppic. \u0027That\u0027s why you fled into the desert.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, yes. You\u0027re right. Damn right. I was being persecuted for my beliefs.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s terrible,\u0027 said Teppic.\n Khuft spat. \u0027Damn right. I believed people wouldn\u0027t notice I\u0027d sold them camels with plaster teeth until I was well out of town.\u0027\n It took a little while for this to sink in, but it managed it with all the aplomb of a concrete block in a quicksand.\n \u0027You\u0027re a criminal?\u0027 said Teppic.\n \u0027Well, criminal\u0027s a dirty word, know what I mean?\u0027 said the little ancestor. \u0027I\u0027d prefer entrepreneur. I was ahead of my time, that\u0027s my trouble.\u0027\n \u0027And you were running away?\u0027 said Teppic weakly.\n \u0027It wouldn\u0027t,\u0027 said Khuft, \u0027have been a good idea to hang about.\u0027\n \u0027“And Khuft the camel herder became lost in the Desert, and there opened before him, as a Gift from the Gods, a Valley flowing with Milk and Honey”,\u0027 quoted Teppic, in a hollow voice. He added, \u0027I used to think it must have been awfully sticky.\u0027\n \u0027There I was, dying of thirst, all the camels kicking up a din, yelling for water, next minute - whoosh - a bloody great river valley, reed beds, hippos, the whole thing. Out of nowhere. I nearly got knocked down in the stampede.\u0027\n \u0027No!\u0027 said Teppic. \u0027It wasn\u0027t like that! The gods of the valley took pity on you and showed you the way in, didn\u0027t they?\u0027 He shut up, surprised at the tones of pleading in his own voice.\n Khuft sneered. \u0027Oh, yes? And I just happened to stumble across a hundred miles of river in the middle of the desert that everyone else had missed. Easy thing to miss, a hundred miles of river valley in the middle of a desert, isn\u0027t it? Not that I was going to look a gift camel in the mouth, you understand, I went and brought my family and the rest of the lads in soon enough. Never looked back.\u0027\n \u0027One minute it wasn\u0027t there, the next minute it was?\u0027 said Teppic.\n \u0027Right enough. Hard to believe, isn\u0027t it?\u0027\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Teppic. \u0027No. Not really.\u0027 Khuft poked him with a wrinkled finger. \u0027I always reckoned it was the camels that did it,\u0027 he said. \u0027I always thought they sort of called it into place, like it was sort of potentially there but not quite, and it needed just that little bit of effort to make it real. Funny things, camels.\u0027\n \u0027I know.\u0027\n \u0027Odder than gods. Something the matter?\u0027\n \u0027Sorry,\u0027 said Teppic, \u0027it\u0027s just that this is all a bit of a shock. I mean, I thought we were really royal. I mean, we\u0027re more royal than anyone.\n Khuft picked a fig seed from between two blackened stumps which, because they were in his mouth, probably had to be called his teeth. Then he spat.\n \u0027That\u0027s up to you,\u0027 he said, and vanished.\n Teppic walked through the necropolis, the pyramids a saw-edged skyline against the night. The sky was the arched body of a woman, and the gods stood around the horizon. They didn\u0027t look like the gods that had been painted on the walls for thousands of years. They looked worse. They looked older than Time. After all, the gods hardly ever meddled in the affairs of men. But other things were proverbial for it.\n \u0027What can I do? I\u0027m only human,\u0027 he said aloud.\n Someone said, Not all of you.\n Teppic awoke, to the screaming of seagulls.\n Alfonz, who was wearing a long-sleeved shirt and the expression of one who never means to take it off again, ever, was helping several other men unfurl one of Unnamed\u0027s sails. He looked down at Teppic in his bed of rope and gave him a nod.\n They were moving. Teppic sat up, and saw the dock-side of Ephebe slipping silently away in the grey morning light.\n He stood up unsteadily, groaned, clutched at his head, took a run and dived over the rail.\n Heme Krona, owner of the Camels-R-Us livery stable, walked slowly around You Bastard, humming. He examined the camel\u0027s knees. He gave one of its feet an experimental kick. In a swift movement that took You Bastard completely by surprise he jerked open the beast\u0027s mouth and examined his great yellow teeth, and then jumped away.\n He took a plank of wood from a heap in the corner, dipped a brush in a pot of black paint, and after a moment\u0027s thought carefully wrote, ONE OWNER.\n After some further consideration he added, LO MILEAGE. He was just brushing in GOOD RUNER when Teppic staggered in and leaned, panting, against the doorframe. Pools of water formed around his feet.\n \u0027I\u0027ve come for my camel,\u0027 he said.\n Krona sighed.\n \u0027Last night you said you\u0027d be back in an hour,\u0027 he said. \u0027I\u0027m going to have to charge you for a whole day\u0027s livery, right? Plus I gave him a rub down and did his feet, the full service. That\u0027ll be five cercs, okay emir?\u0027\n \u0027Ah.\u0027 Teppic patted his pocket.\n \u0027Look,\u0027 he said. \u0027I left home in a bit of a hurry, you see. I don\u0027t seem to have any cash on me.\u0027\n \u0027Fair enough, emir.\u0027 Krona turned back to his board. \u0027How do you spell YEARS WARENTY?\u0027\n \u0027I will definitely have the money sent to you,\u0027 said Teppic. Krona gave him the withering smile of one who has seen it all - asses with bodywork re-haired, elephants with plaster tusks, camels with false humps glued on - and knows the festering depths of the human soul when it gets down to business.\n \u0027Pull the other one, rajah,\u0027 he said. \u0027It has got bells on.\u0027\n Teppic fumbled in his tunic.\n \u0027I could give you this valuable knife,\u0027 he said.\n Krona gave it a passing glance, and sniffed.\n \u0027Sorry, emir. No can do. No pay, no camel.\u0027\n \u0027I could give it to you point first,\u0027 said Teppic desperately, knowing that the mere threat would get him expelled from the Guild. He was also aware that as a threat it wasn\u0027t very good. Threats weren\u0027t on the syllabus at the Guild school.\n Whereas Krona had, sitting on straw bales at the back of the stables, a couple of large men who were just beginning to take an interest in the proceedings. They looked like Alfonz\u0027s older brothers.\n Every vehicle depot of any description anywhere in the multiverse has them. They\u0027re never exactly grooms or mechanics or customers or staff. Their function is always unclear. They chew straws or smoke cigarettes in a surreptitious fashion. If there are such things as newspapers around, they read them, or at least look at the pictures.\n They started to watch Teppic closely. One of them picked up a couple of bricks and began to toss them up and down.\n \u0027You\u0027re a young lad, I can see that,\u0027 said Krona, kindly. \u0027You\u0027re just starting out in life, emir. You don\u0027t want trouble.\u0027 He stepped forward.\n You Bastard\u0027s huge shaggy head turned to look at him. In the depths of his brain columns of little numbers whirred upwards again.\n \u0027Look, I\u0027m sorry, but I\u0027ve got to have my camel back,\u0027 said Teppic. \u0027It\u0027s life and death!\u0027\n Krona waved a hand at the two extraneous men.\n You Bastard kicked him. You Bastard had very concise ideas about people putting their hands in his mouth. Besides, he\u0027d seen the bricks, and every camel knew what two bricks added up to. It was a good kick, toes well spread, powerful and deceptively slow. It picked Krona up and delivered him neatly into a steaming heap of Augean stable sweepings.\n Teppic ran, kicked away from the wall, grabbed You Bastard\u0027s dusty coat and landed heavily on his neck.\n \u0027I\u0027m very sorry,\u0027 he said, to such of Krona as was visible. \u0027I really will have some money sent to you.\u0027\n You Bastard, at this point, was waltzing round and round in a circle. Krona\u0027s companions stayed well back as feet like plates whirred through the air.\n Teppic leaned forward and hissed into one madly-waving ear. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pyramids-discworld-7/page-32.html","bookId":1626,"book":{"id":1626,"title":"Pyramids (Discworld #7)","description":"Storyline: \n Pyramids (Discworld #7) \n It\u0027s bad enough being new on the job, but Teppic hasn\u0027t a clue as to what a pharaoh is supposed to do.
