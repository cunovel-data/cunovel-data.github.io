I mean, they didn\u0027t know we were here, did they? You needn\u0027t have pulled me off like that.\u0027\\n\\n Teppic conceded this, rather reluctantly, and eased himself cautiously up the sliding surface of the dune. The voices were arguing again\\n\\n \u0027Give in?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We simply haven\u0027t got all the parameters right.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I know what we haven\u0027t got all right.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What is that, pray?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We haven\u0027t got any more bloody tortoises. That\u0027s what we haven\u0027t got.\u0027\\n\\n Teppic carefully poked his head over the top of the dune. He saw a large cleared area, surrounded by complicated ranks of markers and flags. There were one or two buildings in it, mostly consisting of cages, and several other intricate constructions he could not recognise. In the middle of it all were two men - one small, fat and florid, the other tall and willowy and with an indefinable air of authority. They were wearing sheets. Clustered around them, and not wearing very much at all, was a group of slaves. One of them was holding a bow.\\n\\n Several of them were holding tortoises on sticks. They looked a bit pathetic, like tortoise lollies.\\n\\n \u0027Anyway, it\u0027s cruel,\u0027 said the tall man. \u0027Poor little things. They look so sad with their little legs waggling.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s logically impossible for the arrow to hit them!\u0027 The fat man threw up his hands. \u0027It shouldn\u0027t do it! You must be giving me the wrong type of tortoise,\u0027 he added accusingly.\\n\\n \u0027We ough to try again with faster tortoises.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Or slower arrows?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Possibly, possibly.\u0027\\n\\n Teppic was aware of a faint scuffling by his chin. There was a small tortoise scurrying past him. It had several ricochet marks on its shell.\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027ll have one last try,\u0027 said the fat man. He turned to the slaves. \u0027You lot - go and find that tortoise.\u0027\\n\\n The little reptile gave Teppic a look of mingled pleading and hope. He stared at it, and then lifted it up carefully and tucked it behind a rock.\\n\\n He slid back down the dune to Ptraci.\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s something really weird going on over there,\u0027 he said. \u0027They\u0027re shooting tortoises.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Search me. They seem to think the tortoise ought to be able to run away.\\n\\n \u0027What, from an arrow?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Like I said. Really weird. You stay here. I\u0027ll whistle if it\u0027s safe to follow me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What will you do if it isn\u0027t safe?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Scream.\u0027\\n\\n He climbed the dune again and, after brushing as much sand as possible off his clothing, stood up and waved his cap at the little crowd. An arrow took it out of his hands.\\n\\n \u0027Oops!\u0027 said the fat man. \u0027Sorry!\u0027\\n\\n He scurried across the trampled sand to where Teppic was standing and staring at his stinging fingers.\\n\\n \u0027Just had it in my hand,\u0027 he panted. \u0027Many apologies, didn\u0027t realise it was loaded. Whatever will you think of me?\u0027\\n\\n Teppic took a deep breath.\\n\\n \u0027Xeno\u0027s the name,\u0027 gasped the fat man, before he could speak. \u0027Are you hurt? We did put up warning signs, I\u0027m sure. Did you come in over the desert? You must be thirsty. Would you like a drink? Who are you? You haven\u0027t seen a tortoise up there, have you? Damned fast things, go like greased thunderbolts, there\u0027s no stopping the little buggers.\u0027\\n\\n Teppic deflated again.\\n\\n \u0027Tortoises?\u0027 he said. \u0027Are we talking about those, you know, stones on legs?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s right, that\u0027s right,\u0027 said Xeno. \u0027Take your eyes off them for a second, and vazoom!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Vazoom?\u0027 said Teppic. He knew about tortoises. There were tortoises in the Old Kingdom. They could be called a lot of things - vegetarians, patient, thoughtful, even extremely diligent and persistent sex-maniacs - but never, up until now, fast. Fast was a word particularly associated with tortoises because they were not it.\\n\\n \u0027Are you sure?\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027Fastest animal on the face of the Disc, your common tortoise,\u0027 said Xeno, but he had the grace to look shifty.\\n\\n \u0027Logically, that is,\u0027 he added[25].\\n\\n The tall man gave Teppic a nod.\\n\\n \u0027Take no notice of him, boy,\u0027 he said. \u0027He\u0027s just covering himself because of the accident last week.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The tortoise did beat the hare,\u0027 said Xeno sulkily.\\n\\n \u0027The hare was dead, Xeno,\u0027 said the tall man patiently.\\n\\n \u0027Because you shot it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I was aiming at the tortoise. You know, trying to combine two experiments, cut down on expensive research time, make full use of available-\u0027 Xeno gestured with the bow, which now had another arrow in it.\\n\\n \u0027Excuse me,\u0027 said Teppic. \u0027Could you put it down a minute? Me and my friend have come a long way and it would be nice not to be shot at again.\u0027\\n\\n These two seem harmless, he thought, and almost believed it.\\n\\n He whistled. On cue, Ptraci came around the dune, leading You Bastard. Teppic doubted the capability of her costume to hold any pockets whatsoever, but she seemed to have been able to repair her make-up, re-kohl her eyes and put up her hair. She undulated towards the group like a snake in a skid, determined to hit the strangers with the full force of her personality. She was also holding something in her other hand.\\n\\n \u0027She\u0027s found the tortoise!\u0027 said Xeno. \u0027Well done!\u0027\\n\\n The reptile shot back into its shell. Ptraci glared. She didn\u0027t have much in the world except herself, and didn\u0027t like to be hailed as a mere holder of testudinoids.\\n\\n The tall man sighed. \u0027You know, Xeno,\u0027 he said, \u0027I can\u0027t help thinking you\u0027ve got the wrong end of the stick with this whole tortoise-and-arrow business.\u0027\\n\\n The little man glared at him.\\n\\n \u0027The trouble with you, Ibid,\u0027 he said, \u0027is that you think you\u0027re the biggest bloody authority on everything.\u0027\\n\\n The Gods of the Old Kingdom were awakening.\\n\\n Belief is a force. It\u0027s a weak force, by comparison with gravity; when it comes to moving mountains, gravity wins every time. But it still exists, and now that the Old Kingdom was enclosed upon itself, floating free of the rest of the universe, drifting away from the general consensus that is dignified by the name of reality, the power of belief was making itself felt.\\n\\n For seven thousand years the people of Djelibeybi had believed in their gods.\\n\\n Now their gods existed. They had, as it were, the complete Set.\\n\\n And the people of the Old Kingdom were learning that, for example, Vut the Dog-Headed God of the Evening looks a lot better painted on a pot than he does when all seventy feet of him, growling and stinking, is lurching down the Street outside.\\n\\n Dios sat in the throne room, the gold mask of the king on his knees, staring out across the sombre air. The cluster of lesser priests around the door finally plucked up the courage to approach him, in the same general frame of mind as you would approach a growling lion. No-one is more worried by the actual physical manifestation of a god than his priests; it\u0027s like having the auditors in unexpectedly.\\n\\n Only Koomi stood a little aside from the others. He was thinking hard. Strange and original thoughts were crowding along rarely-trodden neural pathways, heading in unthinkable directions. He wanted to see where they led.\\n\\n \u0027O Dios,\u0027 murmured the high priest of Ket, the This-Headed God of Justice. \u0027What is the king\u0027s command? The gods are striding the land, and they are fighting and breaking houses, O Dios. Where is the king? What would he have us do?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yea,\u0027 said the high priest of Scrab, the Pusher of the Ball of the Sun. He felt something more was expected of him. \u0027And verily,\u0027 he added. \u0027Your lordship will have noticed that the sun is wobbling, because all the Gods of the Sun are fighting for it and-\u0027 he shuffled his feet - \u0027the blessed Scrab made a strategic withdrawal and has, er, made an unscheduled landing on the town of Hort. A number of buildings broke his fall.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And rightly so,\u0027 said the high priest of Thrrp, the Charioteer of the Sun. \u0027For, as all know, my master is the true god of the-\u0027\\n\\n His words tailed off.\\n\\n Dios was trembling, his body rocking slowly back and forth. His eyes stared at nothing. His hands gripped the mask almost hard enough to leave fingerprints in the gold, and his lips soundlessly shaped the words of the Ritual of the Second Hour, which had been said at this time for thousands of years.\\n\\n \u0027I think it\u0027s the shock,\u0027 said one of the priests. \u0027You know, he\u0027s always been so set in his ways.\u0027\\n\\n The others hastened to show that there was at least something they could advise on.\\n\\n \u0027Fetch him a glass of water.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Put a paper bag over his head.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sacrifice a chicken under his nose.\u0027\\n\\n There was a high-pitched whistling noise, the distant crump of an explosion, and a long hissing. A few tendrils of steam curled into the room.\\n\\n The priests rushed to the balcony, leaving Dios in his unnerving pool of trauma, and found that the crowds around the palace were staring at the sky.\\n\\n \u0027It would appear,\u0027 said the high priest of Cephut, God of Cutlery, who felt that he could take a more relaxed view of the immediate situation, \u0027that Thrrp has fumbled it and has fallen to a surprise tackle from Jeht, Boatman of the Solar Orb.\u0027\\n\\n There was a distant buzzing, as of several billion bluebottles taking off in a panic, and a huge dark shape passed over the palace.\\n\\n \u0027But,\u0027 said the high priest of Cephut, \u0027here comes Scrab again . . . yes, he\u0027s gaining height . . . Jeht hasn\u0027t seen him yet, he\u0027s progressing confidently towards the meridian, and here comes Sessifet, Goddess of the Afternoon! This is a surprise! What a surprise this is! A young goddess, yet to make her mark, but my word, what a lot of promise there, this is an astonishing bid, eunuchs and gentlemen, and . . yes . . . Scrab has fumbled it! He\u0027s fumbled it! . . .\u0027\\n\\n The shadows danced and spun on the stones of the balcony.\\n\\n \u0027. . . and . . . what\u0027s this? The elder gods are, there\u0027s no other word for it, they\u0027re co-operating against these brash newcomers! But plucky young Sessifet is hanging in there, she\u0027s exploiting the weakness. . . she\u0027s in! . . . and pulling away now, pulling away, Gil and Scrab appear to be fighting, she\u0027s got a clear sky and, yes, yes . . . yes! . . . it\u0027s noon! It\u0027s noon! It\u0027s noon!\u0027\\n\\n Silence. The priest was aware that everyone was staring at him.\\n\\n Then someone said, \u0027Why are you shouting into that bulrush?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sorry. Don\u0027t know what came over me there.\u0027\\n\\n The priestess of Sarduk, Goddess of Caves, snorted at him.\\n\\n \u0027Suppose one of them had dropped it?\u0027 she snapped.\\n\\n \u0027But . . . but . . .\u0027 He swallowed. \u0027It\u0027s not possible, is it? Not really? We all must have eaten something, or been out in the sun too long, or something. Because, I mean, everyone knows that the gods aren\u0027t . . . I mean, the sun is a big flaming ball of gas, isn\u0027t it, that goes around the whole world every day, and, and, and the gods... well, you know, there\u0027s a very real need in people to believe, don\u0027t get me wrong here-\u0027\\n\\n Koomi, even with his head buzzing with thoughts of perfidy, was quicker on the uptake than his colleagues.\\n\\n \u0027Get him, lads!\u0027 he shouted.\\n\\n Four priests grabbed the luckless cutlery worshipper by his arms and legs and gave him a high-speed run across the stones to the edge of the balcony, over the parapet and into the mud-coloured waters of the Djel.\\n\\n He surfaced, spluttering.\\n\\n \u0027What did you go and do that for?\u0027 he demanded. \u0027You all know I\u0027m right. None of you really-\u0027\\n\\n The waters of the Djel opened a lazy jaw, and he vanished, just as the huge winged shape of Scrab buzzed threateningly over the palace and whirred off towards the mountains.\\n\\n Koomi mopped his forehead.\\n\\n \u0027Bit of a close shave there,\u0027 he said. His colleagues nodded, staring at the fading ripples. Suddenly, Djeibeybi was no place for honest doubt. Honest doubt could get you seriously picked up and your arms and legs torn off.\\n\\n \u0027Er,.\u0027 said one of them. \u0027Cephut\u0027s going to be a bit upset, though, isn\u0027t he?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All hail Cephut,\u0027 they chorused. Just in case. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pyramids-discworld-7/page-26.html","bookId":1626,"book":{"id":1626,"title":"Pyramids (Discworld #7)","description":"Storyline: Pyramids (Discworld #7) \\n It\u0027s bad enough being new on the job, but Teppic hasn\u0027t a clue as to what a pharaoh is supposed to do.
