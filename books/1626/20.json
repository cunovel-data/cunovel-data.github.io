Clearly they are not here, sire.\u0027\n \u0027You look as if you could do with a breath of fresh air,\u0027 said Teppic, upbraiding himself for doing this but doing it, nevertheless. Dios at a loss was an awe-inspiring sight, and slightly disconcerting; it made one instinctively fear for the stability of things.\n \u0027Yes, sire. Thank you, sire.\u0027\n \u0027Have a sit down and someone will bring you a glass of water. And then we will go and inspect the pyramid.\u0027\n Dios sat down.\n There was a terrible little splintering noise.\n \u0027He\u0027s sat on the boat,\u0027 said the king. \u0027First humorous thing I\u0027ve ever seen him do.\u0027\n The pyramid gave a new meaning to the word \u0027massive\u0027. It bent the landscape around it. It seemed to Teppic that its very weight was deforming the shape of things, stretching the kingdom like a lead ball on a rubber sheet.\n He knew that was a ridiculous idea. Big though the pyramid was, it was tiny compared to, say, a mountain.\n But big, very big, compared to anything else. Anyway, mountains were meant to be big, the fabric of the universe was used to the idea. The pyramid was a made thing, and much bigger than a made thing ought to be.\n It was also very cold. The black marble of its sides was shining white with frost in the roasting afternoon sun. He was foolish enough to touch it and left a layer of skin on the surface.\n \u0027It\u0027s freezing!\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s storing already, O breath of the river,\u0027 said Ptaclusp, who was sweating. \u0027It\u0027s the wossname, the boundary effect.\u0027\n \u0027I note that you have ceased work on the burial chambers,\u0027 said Dios.\n \u0027The men . . . the temperature . . . boundary effects a bit too much to risk . . .\u0027 muttered Ptaclusp. \u0027Er.\u0027\n Teppic looked from one to the other.\n \u0027What\u0027s the matter?\u0027 he said. \u0027Are there problems?\u0027\n \u0027Er,\u0027 said Ptaclusp.\n \u0027You\u0027re way ahead of schedule. Marvellous work,\u0027 said Teppic. \u0027You\u0027ve put a tremendous amount of labour on the job.\u0027\n \u0027Er. Yes. Only.\u0027\n There was silence except for the distant sounds of men at work, and the faint noise of the air sizzling where it touched the pyramid.\n \u0027It\u0027s bound to be all right when we get the capstone on, the pyramid builder managed eventually. \u0027Once it\u0027s flaring properly, no problem. Er.\u0027\n He indicated the electrum capstone. It was surprisingly small, only a foot or so across, and rested on a couple of trestles.\n \u0027We should be able to put it on tomorrow,\u0027 said Ptaclusp. \u0027Would your sire still be honouring us with the capping-out ceremony?\u0027 In his nervousness he gripped the hem of his robe and began to twist it. \u0027There\u0027s drinks,\u0027 he stuttered. \u0027And a silver trowel that you can take away with you. Everyone shouts hurrah and throws their hats in the air.\n \u0027Certainly,\u0027 said Dios. \u0027It will be an honour.\u0027\n \u0027And for us too, your sire,\u0027 said Ptaclusp loyally.\n \u0027I meant for you,\u0027 said the high priest. He turned to the wide courtyard between the base of the pyramid and the river, which was lined with statues and stelae commemorating King Teppicymon\u0027s mighty deeds[20], and pointed.\n \u0027And you can get rid of that,\u0027 he added.\n Ptaclusp gave him a look of unhappy innocence.\n \u0027That statue,\u0027 said Dios, \u0027is what I am referring to.,\n \u0027Oh. Ah. Well, we thought once you saw it in place, you see, in the right light, and what with Hat the Vulture-Headed God being very-\u0027\n \u0027It goes,\u0027 said Dios.\n \u0027Right you are, your reverence,\u0027 said Ptaclusp miserably. It was, right now, the least of his problems, but on top of everything else he was beginning to think that the statue was following him around.\n Dios leaned closer.\n \u0027You haven\u0027t seen a young woman anywhere on the site, have you?\u0027 he demanded.\n \u0027No women on the site, my lord,\u0027 said Ptaclusp. \u0027Very bad luck.\u0027\n \u0027This one was provocatively dressed,\u0027 the high priest said.\n \u0027No, no women.\u0027\n \u0027The palace is not far, you see. There must be many places to hide over here,\u0027 Dios continued, insistently.\n Ptaclusp swallowed. He knew that, all right. Whatever had possessed him.\n \u0027I assure you, your reverence,\u0027 he said.\n Dios gave him a scowl, and then turned to where Teppic, as it turned out, had been.\n \u0027Please ask him not to shake hands with anybody,\u0027 said the builder, as Dios hurried after the distant glint of sunlight on gold. The king still didn\u0027t seem to be able to get alongside the idea that the last thing the people wanted was a man of the people. Those workers who couldn\u0027t get out of the way in time were thrusting their hands behind their back.\n Alone now, Ptaclusp fanned himself and staggered into the shade of his tent.\n Where, waiting to see him, were Ptaclusp IIa, Ptaclusp IIa, Ptaclusp IIa and Ptaclusp IIa. Ptaclusp always felt uneasy in the presence of accountants, and four of them together was very bad, especially when they were all the same person. Three Ptaclusp IIbs were there as well; the other two, unless it was three by now, were out on the site.\n He waved his hands in a conciliatory way.\n \u0027All right, all right,\u0027 he said. \u0027What are today\u0027s problems?\u0027\n One of the IIas pulled a stack of wax tablets towards him\n \u0027Have you any idea, father,\u0027 he began, employing that thin; razor-edged voice that accountants use to preface something unexpected and very expensive, \u0027what calculus is?\u0027\n \u0027You tell me,\u0027 said Ptaclusp, sagging on to a stool.\n \u0027It\u0027s what I\u0027ve had to invent to deal with the wages bill, father,\u0027 said another IIa.\n \u0027I thought that was algebra?\u0027 said Ptaclusp.\n \u0027We passed algebra last week,\u0027 said a third IIa. \u0027It\u0027s calculus now. I\u0027ve had to loop myself another four times to work on it, and there\u0027s three of me working on-\u0027 he glanced at his brothers - \u0027quantum accountancy.\u0027\n \u0027What\u0027s that for?\u0027 said his father wearily.\n \u0027Next week.\u0027 The leading accountant glared at the top slab. \u0027For example,\u0027 he said. \u0027You know Rthur the fresco painter?\u0027\n \u0027What about him?\u0027\n \u0027He - that is, they - have put in a bill for two years\u0027 work.\u0027\n \u0027Oh.\u0027\n \u0027They said they did it on Tuesday. On account of how time is fractal in nature, they said.\u0027\n \u0027They said that?\u0027 said Ptaclusp.\n \u0027It\u0027s amazing what they pick up,\u0027 said one of the accountants, glaring at the paracosmic architects.\n Ptaclusp hesitated. \u0027How many of them are there?\u0027\n \u0027How should we know? We know there were fifty-three. Then he went critical. We\u0027ve certainly seen him around a lot.\u0027 Two of the IIas sat back and steepled their fingers, always a bad sign in anyone having anything to do with money. \u0027The problem is,\u0027 one of them continued, \u0027that after the initial enthusiasm a lot of the workers looped themselves unofficially so that they could stay at home and send themselves out to work.\u0027\n \u0027But that\u0027s ridiculous,\u0027 Ptaclusp protested weakly. \u0027They\u0027re not different people, they\u0027re just doing it to themselves.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s never stopped anyone, father,\u0027 said IIa. \u0027How many men have stopped drinking themselves stupid at the age of twenty to save a stranger dying of liver failure at forty?\u0027\n There was silence while they tried to work this one out.\n \u0027A stranger-?\u0027 said Ptaclusp uncertainly.\n \u0027I mean himself, when older,\u0027 snapped IIa. \u0027That was philosophy,\u0027 he added.\n \u0027One of the masons beat himself up yesterday,\u0027 said one of the IIbs gloomily. \u0027He was fighting with himself over his wife. Now he\u0027s going mad because he doesn\u0027t know whether it\u0027s an earlier version of him or someone he hasn\u0027t been yet. He\u0027s afraid he\u0027s going to creep up on him. There\u0027s worse than that, too. Dad, we\u0027re paying forty thousand people, and we\u0027re only employing two thousand.\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s going to bankrupt us, that\u0027s what you\u0027re going to say,\u0027 said Ptaclusp. \u0027I know. It\u0027s all my fault. I just wanted something to hand on to you, you know. I didn\u0027t expect all this. It seemed too easy to start with.\u0027\n One of the IIas cleared his throat.\n \u0027It\u0027s . . . uh . . . not quite as bad as all that,\u0027 he said quietly.\n \u0027What do you mean?\u0027\n The accountant laid a dozen copper coins on the table.\n \u0027Well, er,\u0027 he said. \u0027You see, eh, it occurred to me, since there\u0027s all this movement in time, that it\u0027s not just people who can be looped, and, er, look, you see these coins?\u0027\n One coin vanished.\n \u0027They\u0027re all the same coin, aren\u0027t they,\u0027 said one of his brothers.\n \u0027Well, yes,\u0027 said the IIa, very embarrassed, because interfering with the divine flow of money was alien to his personal religion. \u0027The same coin at five minute intervals.\u0027\n \u0027And you\u0027re using this trick to pay the men?\u0027 said Ptaclusp dully.\n \u0027It\u0027s not a trick! I give them the money,\u0027 said IIa primly. \u0027What happens to it afterwards isn\u0027t my responsibility, is it?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t like any of this,\u0027 said his father.\n \u0027Don\u0027t worry. It all evens out in the end,\u0027 said one of the IIas. \u0027Everyone gets what\u0027s coming to them.\u0027\n \u0027Yes. That\u0027s what I\u0027m afraid of,\u0027 said Ptaclusp.\n \u0027It\u0027s just a way of letting your money work for you,\u0027 said another son. \u0027It\u0027s probably quantum.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, good,\u0027 said Ptaclusp weakly.\n \u0027We\u0027ll get the block on tonight, don\u0027t worry,\u0027 said one of the IIbs. \u0027After it\u0027s flared the power off we can all settle down.\u0027\n \u0027I told the king we\u0027d do it tomorrow.\u0027 The Ptaclusp IIbs went pale in unison. Despite the heat, it suddenly seemed a lot colder in the tent.\n \u0027Tonight, father,\u0027 said one of them. \u0027Surely you mean tonight?\n \u0027Tomorrow,\u0027 said Ptaclusp, firmly. \u0027I\u0027ve arranged an awning and people throwing lotus blossom. There\u0027s going to be a band. Tocsins and trumpets and tinkling cymbals. And speeches and a meat tea afterwards. That\u0027s the way we\u0027ve always done it. Attracts new customers. They like to have a look round.\u0027\n \u0027Father, you\u0027ve seen the way it soaks up. . . you\u0027ve seen the frost . .\n \u0027Let it soak. We Ptaclusps don\u0027t go around capping off pyramids as though we were finishing off a garden wall. We don\u0027t knock off like a wossname in the night. People expect a ceremony.\n \u0027But-\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m not listening. I\u0027ve listened to too much of this new-fangled stuff. Tomorrow. I\u0027ve had the bronze plaque made, and the velvet curtains and everything.\u0027\n One of the IIas shrugged. \u0027It\u0027s no good arguing with him,\u0027 he said. \u0027I\u0027m from three hours ahead. I remember this meeting. We couldn\u0027t change his mind.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m from two hours ahead,\u0027 said one of his clones. \u0027I remember you saying that, too.\u0027\n Beyond the walls of the tent, the pyramid sizzled with accumulated time.\n There is nothing mystical about the power of pyramids.\n Pyramids are dams in the stream of time. Correctly shaped and orientated, with the proper paracosmic measurements correctly plumbed in, the temporal potential of the great mass of stone can be diverted to accelerate or reverse time over a very small area, in the same way that a hydraulic ram can be induced to pump water against the flow.\n The original builders, who were of course ancients and therefore wise, knew this very well and the whole point of a correctly-built pyramid was to achieve absolute null time in the central chamber so that a dying king, tucked up there, would indeed live forever - or at least, never actually die. The time that should have passed in the chamber was stored in the bulk of the pyramid and allowed to flare off once every twenty-four hours.\n After a few aeons people forgot this and thought you could achieve the same effect by a) ritual b) pickling people and c) storing their soft inner bits in jars.\n This seldom works.\n And so the art of pyramid tuning was lost, and all the knowledge became a handful of misunderstood rules and hazy recollections. The ancients were far too wise to build very big pyramids. They could cause very strange things, things that would make mere fluctuations in time look tiny by comparison.\n By the way, contrary to popular opinion pyramids don\u0027t sharpen razor blades. They just take them back to when they weren\u0027t blunt. It\u0027s probably because of quantum. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pyramids-discworld-7/page-20.html","bookId":1626,"book":{"id":1626,"title":"Pyramids (Discworld #7)","description":"Storyline: \n Pyramids (Discworld #7) \n It\u0027s bad enough being new on the job, but Teppic hasn\u0027t a clue as to what a pharaoh is supposed to do.
