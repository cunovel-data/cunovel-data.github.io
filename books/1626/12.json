Ptaclusp looked sidelong at the high priest, who nodded.\\n\\n \u0027It has its points, O fount of waters,\u0027 he ventured. He wasn\u0027t used to kings talking to him as though he was a human being. He felt obscurely that it wasn\u0027t right.\\n\\n Teppic waved a hand at the model on its podium.\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 he said uncertainly. \u0027Well. Good. Four walls and a pointy tip. Jolly good. First class. Says it all, really.\u0027 There still seemed to be too much silence around. He plunged on.\\n\\n \u0027Good show,\u0027 he said. \u0027I mean; there\u0027s no doubt about it. This is.. . a. . . pyramid. And what a pyramid it is! Indeed.\u0027 This still didn\u0027t seem enough. He sought for something else. \u0027People will look at it in centuries to come and they\u0027ll say, they\u0027ll say . . . that is a pyramid. Um.\u0027\\n\\n He coughed. \u0027The walls slope nicely,\u0027 he croaked.\\n\\n \u0027But,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n Two pairs of eyes swivelled towards his.\\n\\n \u0027Um,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n Dios raised an eyebrow.\\n\\n \u0027Sire?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I seem to remember once, my father said that, you know, when he died, he\u0027d quite like to, sort of thing, be buried at sea.\u0027\\n\\n There wasn\u0027t the choke of outrage he had expected. \u0027He meant the delta. It\u0027s very soft ground by the delta,\u0027 said Ptaclusp. \u0027It\u0027d take months to get decent footings in. Then there\u0027s your risk of sinking. And the damp. Not good, damp, inside a pyramid.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Teppic, sweating under Dios\u0027s gaze, \u0027I think what he meant was, you know, in the sea.\u0027\\n\\n Ptaclusp\u0027s brow furrowed. \u0027Tricky, that,\u0027 he said thoughtfully. \u0027Interesting idea. I suppose one could build a small one, a million tonner, and float it out on pontoons or something...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Teppic, trying not to laugh, \u0027I think what he meant was, buried without-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Teppicymon XXVII means that he would want to be buried without delay,\u0027 said Dios, his voice like greased silk. \u0027And there is no doubt that he would require to honour the very best you can build, architect.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, I\u0027m sure you\u0027ve got it wrong,\u0027 said Teppic.\\n\\n Dios\u0027s face froze. Ptaclusp\u0027s slid into the waxen expression of someone with whom it is, suddenly, nothing to do. He started to stare at the floor as if his very survival depended on his memorising it in extreme detail.\\n\\n \u0027Wrong?\u0027 said Dios.\\n\\n \u0027No offence. I\u0027m sure you mean well,\u0027 said Teppic. \u0027It\u0027s just that, well, he seemed very clear about it at the time and-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I mean well?\u0027 said Dios, tasting each word as though it was a sour grape. Ptaclusp coughed. He had finished with the floor. Now he started on the ceiling.\\n\\n Dios took a deep breath. \u0027Sire,\u0027 he said, \u0027we have always been pyramid builders. All our kings are buried in pyramids. It is how we do things, sire. It is how things are done.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, but-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It does not admit of dispute,\u0027 said Dios. \u0027Who could wish for anything else? Sealed with all artifice against the desecrations of Time-\u0027 now the oiled silk of his voice became armour, hard as steel, scornful as spears - \u0027Shielded for all Time against the insults of Change.\u0027\\n\\n Teppic glanced down at the high priest\u0027s knuckles. They were white, the bone pressing through the flesh as though in a rage to escape.\\n\\n His gaze slid up the grey-clad arm to Dios\u0027s face. Ye gods, he thought, it\u0027s really true, he does look like they got tired of waiting for him to die and pickled him anyway. Then his eyes met those of the priest, more or less with a clang.\\n\\n He felt as though his flesh was being very slowly blown off his bones. He felt that he was no more significant than a mayfly. A necessary mayfly, certainly, a mayfly that would be accorded all due respect, but still an insect with all the rights thereof. And as much free will, in the fury of that gaze, as a scrap of papyrus in a hurricane.\\n\\n \u0027The king\u0027s will is that he be interred in a pyramid,\u0027 said Dios, in the tone of voice the Creator must have used to sketch out the moon and stars.\\n\\n \u0027Er,\u0027 said Teppic.\\n\\n \u0027The finest of pyramids for the king,\u0027 said Dios.\\n\\n Teppic gave up.\\n\\n \u0027Oh,\u0027 he said. \u0027Good. Fine. Yes. The very best, of course.\u0027 Ptaclusp beamed with relief, produced his wax tablet with a flourish, and took a stylus from the recesses of his wig. The important thing, he knew, was to clinch the deal as soon as possible. Let things slip in a situation like this\u0027 and a man could find himself with 1,500,000 tons of bespoke limestone on his hands.\\n\\n \u0027Then that will be the standard model, shall we say, O water in the desert?\u0027\\n\\n Teppic looked at Dios, who was standing and glaring at nothing now, staring the bulldogs of Entropy into submission by willpower alone.\\n\\n \u0027I think something larger,\u0027 he ventured hopelessly.\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s the Executive,\u0027 said Ptaclusp. \u0027Very exclusive, O base of the eternal column. Last you a perpetuality. Also our special offer this aeon is various measurements of paracosmic significance built into the very fabric at no extra cost.\u0027\\n\\n He gave Teppic an expectant look.\\n\\n \u0027Yes. Yes. That will be fine,\u0027 said Teppic.\\n\\n Dios took a deep breath. \u0027The king requires far more than that,\u0027 be said.\\n\\n \u0027I do?\u0027 said Teppic, doubtfully.\\n\\n \u0027Indeed, sire. It is your express wish that the greatest of monuments is erected for your father,\u0027 said Dios smoothly. This was a contest, Teppic knew, and he didn\u0027t know the rules or how to play and he was going to lose.\\n\\n \u0027It is? Oh. Yes. Yes. I suppose it is, really. Yes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A pyramid unequalled along the Djel,\u0027 said Dios. \u0027That is the command of the king. It is only right and proper.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, yes, something like that. Er. Twice the normal size,\u0027 said Teppic desperately, and had the brief satisfaction of seeing Dios look momentarily disconcerted.\\n\\n \u0027Sire?\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027It is only right and proper,\u0027 said Teppic. Dios opened his mouth to protest, saw Teppic\u0027s expression, and shut it again.\\n\\n Ptaclusp scribbled busily, his adam\u0027s apple bobbing. Something like this only happened once in a business career.\\n\\n \u0027Can do you a very nice black marble facing on the outside,\u0027 he said, without looking up. \u0027We may have just enough in the quarry. O king of the celestial orbs,\u0027 he added hurriedly.\\n\\n \u0027Very good,\u0027 said Teppic.\\n\\n Ptaclusp picked up a fresh tablet. \u0027Shall we say the capstone picked out in electrum? It\u0027s cheaper to have built in right from the start, you don\u0027t want to use just silver and then say later, I wish I\u0027d had a-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Electrum, yes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And the usual offices?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The burial chamber, that is, and the outer chamber. I\u0027d recommend the Memphis, very select, that comes with a matching extra large treasure room, so handy for all those little things one cannot bear to leave behind.\u0027 Ptaclusp turned the tablet over and started on the other side. \u0027And of course a similar suite for the Queen, I take it? O King who shall live forever.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Eh? Oh, yes. Yes. I suppose so,\u0027 said Teppic, glancing at Dios. \u0027Everything. You know.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then there\u0027s mazes,\u0027 said Ptaclusp, trying to keep his voice steady. \u0027Very popular this era. Very important, your maze, it\u0027s no good deciding you ought to have put a maze in after the robbers have been. Maybe I\u0027m old-fashioned, but I\u0027d go for the Labrys every time. Like we say, they may get in all right, but they\u0027ll never get out. It costs that little bit extra, but what\u0027s money at a time like this? O master of the waters.\u0027\\n\\n Something we don\u0027t have, said a warning voice in the back of Teppic\u0027s head. He ignored it. He was in the grip of destiny.\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 he said, straightening up. \u0027The Labrys. Two of them.\u0027\\n\\n Ptaclusp\u0027s stylus went through his tablet.\\n\\n \u0027His \u0027n\u0027 hers, O stone of stones,\u0027 he croaked. \u0027Very handy, very convenient. With selection of traps from stock? We can offer deadfalls, pitfalls, sliders, rolling balls, dropping spears, arrows-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, yes,\u0027 said Teppic. \u0027We\u0027ll have them. We\u0027ll have them all. All of them.\u0027\\n\\n The architect took a deep breath.\\n\\n \u0027And of course you\u0027ll require all the usual steles, avenues, ceremonial sphinxes-\u0027 he began.\\n\\n \u0027Lots,\u0027 said Teppic. \u0027We leave it entirely up to you.\u0027\\n\\n Ptaclusp mopped his brow.\\n\\n \u0027Fine,\u0027 he said. \u0027Marvellous.\u0027 He blew his nose. \u0027Your father, if I may make so bold, O sower of the seed, is extremely fortunate in having such a dutiful son. I may add-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You may go,\u0027 said Dios. \u0027And we will expect work to start imminently.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Without delay, I assure you,\u0027 said Ptaclusp. \u0027Er.\u0027\\n\\n He seemed to be wrestling with some huge philosophical problem.\\n\\n \u0027Yes?\u0027 said Dios coldly.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s uh. There\u0027s the matter of uh. Which is not to say uh. Of course, oldest client, valued customer, but the fact is that uh. Absolutely no doubt about credit worthiness uh. Would not wish to suggest in any way whatsoever that uh.\u0027\\n\\n Dios gave him a stare that would have caused a sphinx to blink and look away.\\n\\n \u0027You wish to say something?\u0027 he said. \u0027His majesty\u0027s time is extremely limited.\u0027\\n\\n Ptaclusp worked his jaw silently, but the result was a foregone conclusion. Even gods had been reduced to sheepish mumbling in the face of Dios\u0027s face. And the carved snakes on his staff seemed to be watching him too.\\n\\n \u0027Uh. No, no. Sorry. I was just, uh, thinking aloud. I\u0027ll depart, then, shall I? Such a lot of work to be done. Uh.\u0027 He bowed low.\\n\\n He was halfway to the archway before Dios added: \u0027Completion in three months. In time for Inundation.\u0027[12]\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You are talking to the 1,398th monarch,\u0027 said Dios icily. Ptaclusp swallowed. \u0027I\u0027m sorry,\u0027 he whispered, \u0027I mean, what?, O great king. I mean, block haulage alone will take. Uh.\u0027 The architect\u0027s lips trembled as he tried out various comments and, in his imagination, ran them full tilt into Dios\u0027s stare. \u0027Tsort wasn\u0027t built in a day,\u0027 he mumbled.\\n\\n \u0027We do not believe we laid the specifications for that job,\u0027 said Dios. He gave Ptaclusp a smile. In some ways it was worse than everything else. \u0027We will, of course,\u0027 he said, \u0027pay extra.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But you never pa-\u0027 Ptaclusp began, and then sagged.\\n\\n \u0027The penalties for not completing on time will, of course, be terrible,\u0027 said Dios. \u0027The usual clause.\u0027\\n\\n Ptaclusp hadn\u0027t the nerve left to argue. \u0027Of course,\u0027 he said, utterly defeated. \u0027It is an honour. Will your eminences excuse me? There are still some hours of daylight left.\u0027\\n\\n Teppic nodded.\\n\\n \u0027Thank you,\u0027 said the architect. \u0027May your loins be truly fruitful. Saving your presence, Lord Dios.\u0027\\n\\n They heard him running down the steps outside.\\n\\n \u0027It will be magnificent. Too big, but - magnificent,\u0027 said Dios. He looked out between the pillars at the necropolic panorama on the far bank of the Djel.\\n\\n \u0027Magnificent,\u0027 he repeated. He winced once more at the stab of pain in his leg. Ah. He\u0027d have to cross the river again tonight, no doubt of it. He\u0027d been foolish, putting it off for days. But it would be unthinkable not to be in a position to serve the kingdom properly.\\n\\n \u0027Something wrong, Dios?\u0027 said Teppic.\\n\\n \u0027Sire?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You looked a bit pale, I thought.\u0027 A look of panic flickered over Dios\u0027s wrinkled features. He pulled himself upright.\\n\\n \u0027I assure you, sire, I am in the best of health. The best of health, sire!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You don\u0027t think you\u0027ve been overdoing it, do you?\u0027\\n\\n This time there was no mistaking the expression of terror.\\n\\n \u0027Overdoing what, sire?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re always bustling, Dios. First one up, last one to bed. You should take it easy.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I exist only to serve, sire,\u0027 said Dios, firmly. \u0027I exist only to serve.\u0027\\n\\n Teppic joined him on the balcony. The early evening sun glowed on a man-made mountain range. This was only the central massif; the pyramids stretched from the delta all the way up to the second cataract, where the Djel disappeared into the mountains. And the pyramids occupied the best land, near the river. Even the farmers would have considered it sacrilegious to suggest anything different.\\n\\n Some of the pyramids were small, and made of rough-hewn blocks that contrived to look far older than the mountains that fenced the valley from the high desert. After all, mountains had always been there. Words like \u0027young\u0027 and \u0027old\u0027 didn\u0027t apply to them. But those first pyramids had been built by human beings, little bags of thinking water held up briefly by fragile accumulations of calcium, who had cut rocks into pieces and then painfully put them back together again in a better shape. They were old. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pyramids-discworld-7/page-12.html","bookId":1626,"book":{"id":1626,"title":"Pyramids (Discworld #7)","description":"Storyline: Pyramids (Discworld #7) \\n It\u0027s bad enough being new on the job, but Teppic hasn\u0027t a clue as to what a pharaoh is supposed to do.
