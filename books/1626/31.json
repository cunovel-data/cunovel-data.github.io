His son poked his head cautiously over the ruins of a pillar and watched Hat, the Vulture-Headed God. \u0027It\u0027s sniffing around,\u0027 he said. \u0027I think it likes the statue. Honestly, dad, why did you have to go and buy a thing like that?\u0027 \u0027It was in a job lot,\u0027 said Ptaclusp. \u0027Anyway, I thought it would be a popular line.\u0027 \u0027With who?\u0027 \u0027Well, he likes it.\u0027 Ptaclusp IIb risked another squint at the angular monstrosity that was still hopping around the ruins. \u0027Tell him he can have it if he goes away,\u0027 he suggested. \u0027Tell him he can have it at cost.\u0027 Ptaclusp winced. \u0027At a discount,\u0027 he said. \u0027A special cut rate for our supernatural customers. He stared up at the sky. From their hiding place in the ruins of the construction camp, with the Great Pyramid still humming like a powerhouse behind them, they\u0027d had an excellent view of the arrival of the gods. At first he\u0027d viewed them with a certain amount of equanimity. Gods would be good customers, they always wanted temples and statues, he could deal directly, cut out the middle man. And then it had occurred to him that a god, when he was unhappy about the product, as it might be, maybe the plasterwork wasn\u0027t exactly as per spec, or perhaps a corner of the temple was a bit low on account of unexpected quicksand, a god didn\u0027t just come around demanding in a loud voice to see the manager. No. A god knew exactly where you were, and got to the point. Also, gods were notoriously bad payers. So were humans, of course, but they didn\u0027t actually expect you to die before they settled the account. His gaze turned to his other son, a painted silhouette against the statue, his mouth a frozen O of astonishment, and Ptaclusp reached a decision. \u0027I\u0027ve just about had it with pyramids,\u0027 he said. \u0027Remind me, lad. If we ever get out of here, no more pyramids. We\u0027ve got set in our ways. Time to branch out, I reckon.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s what I\u0027ve been telling you for ages, dad!\u0027 said IIb. \u0027I\u0027ve told you, a couple of decent aqueducts will make a tremendous-\u0027 \u0027Yes, yes, I remember,\u0027 said Ptaclusp. \u0027Yes. Aqueducts. All those arches and things. Fine. Only I can\u0027t remember where you said you have to put the coffin in.\u0027 \u0027Dad!\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t mind me, lad. I think I\u0027m going mad.\u0027 I couldn\u0027t have seen a mummy and two men over there, carrying sledgehammers. It was, indeed, Chidder. And Chidder had a boat. Teppic knew that further along the coast the Seriph of Al-Khali lived in the fabulous palace of the Rhoxie, which was said to have been built in one night by a genie and was famed in myth and legend for its splendour.[29] The Unnamed was the Rhoxie afloat, but more so. Its designer had a gilt complex, and had tried every trick with gold paint, curly pillars and expensive drapes to make it look less like a ship and more like a boudoir that had collided with a highly suspicious type of theatre. In fact, you needed an assassin\u0027s eyes for hidden detail to notice how innocently the gaudiness concealed the sleekness of the hull and the fact, even when you added the cabin space and the holds together, that there still seemed to be a lot of capacity unaccounted for. The water around what Ptraci called the pointed end was strangely rippled, but it would be totally ridiculous to suspect such an obvious merchantman of having a concealed ramming spike underwater, or that a mere five minutes\u0027 work with an axe would turn this wallowing Alcdzar into something that could run away from nearly everything else afloat and make the few that could catch up seriously regret it. \u0027Very impressive,\u0027 said Teppic. \u0027It\u0027s all show, really,\u0027 said Chidder. \u0027Yes. I can see that.\u0027 \u0027I mean, we\u0027re poor traders.\u0027 Teppic nodded. \u0027The usual phrase is “poor but honest traders”,\u0027 he said. Chidder smiled a merchant\u0027s smile. \u0027Oh, I think we\u0027ll stick on “poor” at the moment. How the hell are you, anyway? Last we heard you were going off to be king of some place no-one\u0027s ever heard of. And who is this lovely young lady?\u0027 \u0027Her name\u0027 Teppic began. \u0027Ptraci,\u0027 said Ptraci. \u0027She\u0027s a hand-\u0027 Teppic began. \u0027She must surely be a royal princess,\u0027 said Chidder smoothly. \u0027And it would give me the greatest pleasure if she, if indeed both of you, would dine with me tonight. Humble sailor\u0027s fare, I\u0027m afraid, but we muddle along, we muddle along.\u0027 \u0027Not Ephebian, is it?\u0027 said Teppic. \u0027Ship\u0027s biscuit, salt beef, that sort of thing,\u0027 said Chidder, without taking his eyes off Ptraci. They hadn\u0027t left her since she came on board. Then he laughed. It was the old familiar Chidder laugh, not exactly without humour, but clearly well under the control of its owner\u0027s higher brain centres. \u0027What an astonishing coincidence,\u0027 he said. \u0027And us due to sail at dawn, too. Can I offer you a change of clothing? You both look somewhat, er, travel-stained.\u0027 \u0027Rough sailor clothing, I expect,\u0027 said Teppic. \u0027As befits a humble merchant, correct me if I\u0027m wrong?\u0027 In fact Teppic was shown to a small cabin as exquisitely and carefully furnished as a jewelled egg, where there was laid upon the bed as fine an assortment of clothing as could be found anywhere on the Circle Sea. True, it all appeared second-hand, but carefully laundered and expertly stitched so that the sword cuts hardly showed at all. He gazed thoughtfully at the hooks on the wall, and the faint patching on the wood which hinted that various things had once been hung there and hastily removed. He stepped out into the narrow corridor, and met Ptraci. She\u0027d chosen a red court dress such as had been the fashion in Ankh-Morpork ten years previously, with puffed sleeves and vast concealed underpinnings and ruffs the size of millstones. Teppic learned something new, which was that attractive women dressed in a few strips of gauze and a few yards of silk can actually look far more desirable when fully clad from neck to ankle. She gave an experimental twirl. \u0027There are any amount of things like this in there,\u0027 she said. \u0027Is this how women dress in Ankh-Morpork? It\u0027s like wearing a house. It doesn\u0027t half make you sweaty.\u0027 \u0027Look, about Chidder,\u0027 said Teppic urgently. \u0027I mean, he\u0027s a good fellow and everything, but-\u0027 \u0027He\u0027s very kind, isn\u0027t he,\u0027 she agreed. \u0027Well. Yes. He is,\u0027 Teppic admitted, hopelessly. \u0027He\u0027s an old friend.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s nice.\u0027 One of the crew materialised at the end of the corridor and bowed them into the state cabin, his air of old retainership marred only by the criss-cross pattern of scars on his head and some tattoos that made the pictures in The Shuttered Palace look like illustrations in a DIY shelving manual. The things he could make them do by flexing his biceps could keep entire dockside taverns fascinated for hours, and he was not aware that the worst moment of his entire life was only a few minutes away. \u0027This is all very pleasant,\u0027 said Chidder, pouring some wine. He nodded at the tattooed man. \u0027You may serve the soup, Alfonz,\u0027 he added. \u0027Look, Chiddy, you\u0027re not a pirate, are you?\u0027 said Teppic, desperately. \u0027Is that what\u0027s been worrying you?\u0027 Chidder grinned his lazy grin. It wasn\u0027t everything that Teppic had been worrying about, but it had been jockeying for top position. He nodded. \u0027No, we\u0027re not. We just prefer to, er, avoid paperwork wherever possible. You know? We don\u0027t like people to have all the worry of having to know everything we do.\u0027 \u0027Only there\u0027s all the clothes-\u0027 \u0027Ah. We get attacked by pirates a fair amount. That\u0027s why father had the Unnamed built. It always surprises them. And the whole thing is morally sound. We get their ship, their booty, and any prisoners they may have get rescued and given a ride home at competitive rates.\u0027 \u0027What do you do with the pirates?\u0027 Chidder glanced at Alfonz. \u0027That depends on future employment prospects,\u0027 he said. \u0027Father always says that a man down on his luck should be offered a helping hand. On terms, that is. How\u0027s the king business?\u0027 Teppic told him. Chidder listened intently, swilling the wine around in his glass. \u0027So that\u0027s it,\u0027 he said at last. \u0027We heard there was going to be a war. That\u0027s why we\u0027re sailing tonight.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t blame you,\u0027 said Teppic. \u0027No, I mean to get the trade organised. With both sides, naturally, because we\u0027re strictly impartial. The weapons produced on this continent are really quite shocking. Down-right dangerous. You should come with us, too. You\u0027re a very valuable person.\u0027 \u0027Never felt more valueless than right now,\u0027 said Teppic despondently. Chidder looked at him in amazement. \u0027But you\u0027re a king!\u0027 he said. \u0027Well, yes, but-\u0027 \u0027Of a country which technically still exists, but isn\u0027t actually reachable by mortal man?\u0027 \u0027Sadly so.\u0027 \u0027And you can pass laws about, well, currency and taxation, yes?\u0027 \u0027I suppose so, but-\u0027 \u0027And you don\u0027t think you\u0027re valuable? Good grief, Tep, our accountants can probably think up fifty different ways to . . . well, my hands go damp just to think about it. Father will probably ask to move our head office there, for a start.\u0027 \u0027Chidder, I explained. You know it. No-one can get in,\u0027 said Teppic. \u0027That doesn\u0027t matter.\u0027 \u0027Doesn\u0027t matter?\u0027 \u0027No, because we\u0027ll just make Ankh our main branch office and pay our taxes in wherever the place is. All we need is an official address in, I don\u0027t know, the Avenue of the Pyramids or something. Take my tip and don\u0027t give in on anything until father gives you a seat on the board. You\u0027re royal, anyway, that\u0027s always impressive . . Chidder chattered on. Teppic felt his clothes growing hotter. So this was it. You lost your kingdom, and then it was worth more because it was a tax haven, and you took a seat on the board, whatever that was, and that made it all right. Ptraci defused the situation by grabbing Alfonz\u0027s arm as he was serving the pheasant. \u0027The Congress of The Friendly Dog and the Two Small Biscuits!\u0027 she exclaimed, examining the intricate tattoo. \u0027You hardly ever see that these days. Isn\u0027t it well done? You can even make out the yoghurt.\u0027 Alfonz froze, and then blushed. Watching the glow spread across the great scarred head was like watching sunrise over a mountain range. \u0027What\u0027s the one on your other arm?\u0027 Alfonz, who looked as though his past jobs had included being a battering ram, murmured something and, very shyly, showed her his forearm. \u0027\u0027S\u0027not really suitable for ladies,\u0027 he whispered. Ptraci brushed aside the wiry hair like a keen explorer, while Chidder stared at her with his mouth hanging open. \u0027Oh, I know that one,\u0027 she said dismissively. \u0027That\u0027s out of 130 Days of Pseudopolis. It\u0027s physically impossible.\u0027 She let go of the arm, and turned back to her meal. After a moment she looked up at Teppic and Chidder. \u0027Don\u0027t mind me,\u0027 she said brightly. \u0027Do go on. \u0027Alfonz, please go and put a proper shirt on,\u0027 said Chidder, hoarsely. Alfonz backed away, staring at his arm. \u0027Er. What was I, er, saying?\u0027 said Chidder. \u0027Sorry. Lost the thread. Er. Have some more wine, Tep?\u0027 Ptraci didn\u0027t just derail the train of thought, she ripped up the rails, burned the stations and melted the bridges for scrap. And so the dinner trailed off into beef pie, fresh peaches, crystallised sea urchins and desultory small talk about the good old days at the Guild. They had been three months ago. It seemed like a lifetime. Three months in the Old Kingdom was a lifetime. After some time Ptraci yawned and went to her cabin, leaving the two of them alone with a fresh bottle of wine. Chidder watched her go in awed silence. \u0027Are there many like her back at your place?\u0027 he said. \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 Teppic admitted. \u0027There could be. Usually they lie around the place peeling grapes or waving fans.\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pyramids-discworld-7/page-31.html","bookId":1626,"book":{"id":1626,"title":"Pyramids (Discworld #7)","description":"Storyline: Pyramids (Discworld #7) It\u0027s bad enough being new on the job, but Teppic hasn\u0027t a clue as to what a pharaoh is supposed to do.
