He hadn\u0027t the faintest idea.\n \u0027We\u0027ll go to the palace,\u0027 he said firmly. \u0027It\u0027s probably a trick of the, of the, of the dark. Anyway, the sun will be up presently.\u0027\n He strode off, wishing he could change places with Gern and show just a hint of gibbering terror. The apprentice followed him at a sort of galloping creep.\n \u0027I can see shadows against the stars, master! Can you see them, master? Around the edge of the world, master!\u0027\n \u0027Just mists, boy,\u0027 said Dil, resolutely keeping his eyes fixed in front of him and maintaining a dignified posture as appropriate to the Keeper of the Left Hand Door of the Matron Lodge and holder of several medals for needlework.\n \u0027There,\u0027 he said. \u0027See, Gern, the sun is coming up!\u0027\n They stood and watched it.\n Then Gern whimpered, very quietly.\n Rising up the sky, very slowly, was a great flaming ball. And it was being pushed by a dung beetle bigger than worlds.\n BOOK III\n The Book of the New Son\n The sun rose and, because this wasn\u0027t the Old Kingdom out here, it was a mere ball of flaming gas. The purple night of the high desert evaporated under its blowlamp glare. Lizards scuffled into cracks in the rocks. You Bastard settled himself down in the sparse shadow of what was left of the syphacia bushes, peered haughtily at the landscape, and began to chew cud and calculate square roots in base seven.\n Teppic and Ptraci eventually found the shade of a limestone overhang, and sat glumly staring out at the waves of heat wobbling off the rocks.\n \u0027I don\u0027t understand,\u0027 said Ptraci. \u0027Have you looked everywhere?\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s a country! It can\u0027t just bloody well fall through a hole in the ground!\u0027\n \u0027Where is it, then?\u0027 said Ptraci evenly.\n Teppic growled. The heat struck like a hammer, but he strode out over the rocks as though three hundred square miles could perhaps have been hiding under a pebble or behind a bush.\n The fact was that the track dipped between the cliffs, but almost immediately rose again and continued across the dunes into what was quite clearly Tsort. He\u0027d recognised a wind-eroded sphinx that had been set up as a boundary marker; legend said it prowled the borders in times of dire national need, although legend wasn\u0027t sure why.\n He knew they had galloped into Ephebe. He should be looking across the fertile, pyramid-speckled valley of the Djel that lay between the two countries.\n He\u0027d spent an hour looking for it.\n It was inexplicable. It was uncanny. It was also extremely embarrassing.\n He shaded his eyes and stared around for the thousandth time at the silent, baking landscape. And moved his head. And saw Djelibeybi.\n It flashed across his vision in an instant. He jerked his eyes back and saw it again, a brief flash of misty colour that vanished as soon as he concentrated on it.\n Some minutes later Ptraci peered out of the shade and saw him get down on his hands and knees. When he started turning over rocks she decided it was time he should come back in out of the sun.\n He shook her hand off his shoulder, and gestured impatiently. \u0027I\u0027ve found it!\u0027 He pulled a knife from his boot and started poking at the stones.\n \u0027Where?\u0027\n \u0027Here!\u0027\n She laid a ringed hand on his forehead.\n \u0027Oh yes,\u0027 she said. \u0027I see. Yes. Good. Now I think you\u0027d better come into the shade.\u0027\n \u0027No, I mean it! Here! Look!\u0027\n She hunkered down and stared at the rock, to humour him.\n \u0027There\u0027s a crack,\u0027 she said, doubtfully.\n \u0027Look at it, will you? You have to turn your head and sort of look out of the corner of your eye.\u0027 Teppic\u0027s dagger smacked into the crack, which was no more than a faint line on the rock.\n \u0027Well, it goes on a long way,\u0027 said Ptraci, staring along the burning pavement.\n \u0027All the way from the Second Cataract to the Delta,\u0027 said Teppic. \u0027Covering your eye with one hand helps. Please give it a try. Please!\u0027\n She put one hesitant hand over her eye and squinted obediently at the rock.\n Eventually she said. \u0027It\u0027s no good, I can\u0027t - seeee-\u0027 She stayed motionless for a moment and then flung herself sideways on to the rocks. Teppic stopped trying to hammer the knife into the crack and crawled over to her.\n \u0027I was right on the edge!\u0027 she wailed.\n \u0027You saw it?\u0027 he said hopefully.\n She nodded and, with great care, got to her feet and backed away.\n \u0027Did your eyes feel as though they were being turned inside out?\u0027 said Teppic.\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Ptraci coldly. \u0027Can I have my bangles, please?\u0027\n \u0027What?\u0027\n \u0027My bangles. You put them in your pocket. I want them, please.\u0027\n Teppic shrugged, and fished in his pouch. The bangles were mostly copper, with a few bits of chipped enamel. Here and there the craftsman had tried, without much success, to do something interesting with twisted bits of wire and lumps of coloured glass. She took them and slipped them on.\n \u0027Do they have some occult significance?\u0027 he said.\n \u0027What\u0027s occult mean?\u0027 she said vaguely.\n \u0027Oh. What do you need them for, then?\u0027\n \u0027I told you. I don\u0027t feel properly dressed without them on.\u0027 Teppic shrugged, and went back to rocking his knife in the crack.\n \u0027Why are you doing that?\u0027 she said. He stopped and thought about it.\n \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 he said. \u0027But you did see the valley, didn\u0027t you?\u0027\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\n \u0027Well, then?\u0027\n \u0027Well what?\u0027\n Teppic rolled his eyes. \u0027Didn\u0027t you think it was a bit, well, odd? A whole country just more or less vanishing? It\u0027s something you don\u0027t bloody well see every day, for gods\u0027 sake!\u0027\n \u0027How should I know? I\u0027ve never been out of the valley before. I don\u0027t know what it\u0027s supposed to look like from outside. And don\u0027t swear.\u0027\n Teppic shook his head. \u0027I think I will go and lie down in the shade,\u0027 he said. \u0027What\u0027s left of it,\u0027 he added, for the brass light of the sun was burning away the shadows. He staggered over to the rocks and stared at her.\n \u0027The whole valley has just closed up,\u0027 he managed at last. \u0027All those people . .\n \u0027I saw cooking fires,\u0027 said Ptraci, slumping down beside him.\n \u0027It\u0027s something to do with the pyramid,\u0027 he said. \u0027It looked very strange just before we left. It\u0027s magic, or geometry, or one of those things. How do you think we can get back?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t want to go back. Why should I want to go back? It\u0027s the crocodiles for me. I\u0027m not going back, not just for crocodiles.\u0027\n \u0027Um. Perhaps I could pardon you, or something,\u0027 said Teppic.\n \u0027Oh yes,\u0027 said Ptraci, looking at her nails. \u0027You said you were the king, didn\u0027t you.\u0027\n \u0027I am the king! That\u0027s my kingdom over-\u0027 Teppic hesitated, not knowing in which direction to point his finger - \u0027somewhere. I\u0027m king of it.\u0027\n \u0027You don\u0027t look like the king,\u0027 said Ptraci.\n \u0027Why not?\u0027\n \u0027He had a golden mask on.\u0027\n \u0027That was me!\u0027\n \u0027So you ordered me thrown to the crocodiles?\u0027\n \u0027Yes! I mean, no.\u0027 Teppic hesitated. \u0027I mean, the king did. I didn\u0027t. In a way. Anyway, I was the one who rescued you,\u0027 he added gallantly.\n \u0027There you are, then. Anyway, if you were the king, you\u0027d be a god, too. You aren\u0027t acting very god-like at the moment.\u0027\n \u0027Yes? Well. Er.\u0027 Teppic hesitated again. Ptraci\u0027s literal mindedness meant that innocent sentences had to be carefully examined before being sent out into the world.\n \u0027I\u0027m basically good at making the sun rise,\u0027 he said. \u0027I don\u0027t know how, though. And rivers. You want any rivers flooding, I\u0027m your man. God, I mean.\u0027\n He lapsed into silence as a thought struck him.\n \u0027I wonder what\u0027s happening in there without me?\u0027 he said.\n Ptraci stood up and set off down to the gorge.\n \u0027Where are you going?\u0027\n She turned. \u0027Well, Mr King or God or assassin, or whatever, can you make water?\u0027\n \u0027What, here?\u0027\n \u0027I mean to drink. There may be a river hidden in that crack or there may not, but we can\u0027t get at it, can we? So we have to go somewhere where we can. It\u0027s so simple I should think even kings could understand it.\u0027\n He hurried after her, down the scree to where You Bastard was lying with his head and neck flat on the ground, flicking his ears in the heat and idly applying You Vicious Brute\u0027s Theory of Transient Integrals to a succession of promising cissoid numbers. Ptraci kicked him irritably.\n \u0027Do you know where there is water, then?\u0027 said Teppic. . . . e/27. Eleven miles . . .\n Ptraci glared at him from kohl-ringed eyes. \u0027You mean you don\u0027t know? You were going to take me into the desert and you don\u0027t know where the water is?\u0027\n \u0027Well, I rather expected I was going to be able to take some with me!\u0027\n \u0027You didn\u0027t even think about it!\u0027\n \u0027Listen, you can\u0027t talk to me like that! I\u0027m a king!\u0027 Teppic stopped.\n \u0027You\u0027re absolutely right,\u0027 he said. \u0027I never thought about it. Where I come from it rains nearly every day. I\u0027m sorry.\u0027\n Ptraci\u0027s brows furrowed. \u0027Who reigns nearly every day?\u0027 she said.\n \u0027No, I mean rain. You know. Very thin water coming out of the sky?\u0027\n \u0027What a silly idea. Where do you come from?\u0027\n Teppic looked miserable. \u0027Where I come from is Ankh-Morpork. Where I started from is here.\u0027 He stared down the track. From here, if you knew what you were looking for, you could just see a faint crack running across the rocks. It climbed the cliffs on either side, a new vertical fault the thickness of a line that just happened to contain a complete river kingdom and 7,000 years of history.\n He\u0027d hated every minute of his time there. And now it had shut him out. And now, because he couldn\u0027t, he wanted to go back.\n He wandered down to it and put his hand over one eye. If you jerked your head just right . . .\n It flashed past his vision briefly, and was gone. He tried a few times more, and couldn\u0027t see it again.\n If I hacked the rocks away? No, he thought, that\u0027s silly. It\u0027s a line. You can\u0027t get into a line. A line has no thickness. Well known fact of geometry.\n He heard Ptraci come up behind him, and the next moment her hands were on his neck. For a second he wondered how she knew the Catharti Death Grip, and then her fingers were gently massaging his muscles, stresses melting under their expert caress like fat under a hot knife. He shivered as the tension relaxed.\n \u0027That\u0027s nice,\u0027 he said.\n \u0027We\u0027re trained for it. Your tendons are knotted up like ping-pong balls on a string,\u0027 said Ptraci.\n Teppic gratefully subsided on to one of the boulders that littered the base of the cliff and let the rhythm of her fingers unwind the problems of the night.\n \u0027I don\u0027t know what to do,\u0027 he murmured. \u0027That feels good.\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s not all peeling grapes, being a handmaiden,\u0027 said Ptraci. \u0027The first lesson we learn is, when the master has had a long hard day it is not the best time to suggest the Congress of the Fox and the Persimmon. Who says you have to do anything?\u0027\n \u0027I feel responsible.\u0027 Teppic shifted position like a cat.\n \u0027If you know where there is a dulcimer I could play you something soothing,\u0027 said Ptraci. \u0027I\u0027ve got as far as “Goblins Picnic” in Book I.\u0027\n \u0027I mean, a king shouldn\u0027t let his kingdom just vanish like that.\u0027\n \u0027All the other girls can do chords and everything,\u0027 said Ptraci wistfully, massaging his shoulders. \u0027But the old king always said he\u0027d rather hear me. He said it used to cheer him up.\u0027\n \u0027I mean, it\u0027ll be called the Lost Kingdom,\u0027 said Teppic drowsily. \u0027How will I feel then, I ask you?\u0027\n \u0027He said he liked my singing, too. Everyone else said it sounded like a flock of vultures who\u0027ve just found a dead donkey.\u0027\n \u0027I mean, king of a Lost Kingdom. It\u0027d be dreadful. I\u0027ve got to get it back.\u0027\n You Bastard slowly turned his massive head to follow the flight of an errant blowfly; deep in his brain little columns of red numbers flickered, detailing vectors and speed and elevation. The conversation of human beings seldom interested him, but it crossed his mind that the males and females always got along best when neither actually listened fully to what the other one was saying. It was much simpler with camels. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pyramids-discworld-7/page-24.html","bookId":1626,"book":{"id":1626,"title":"Pyramids (Discworld #7)","description":"Storyline: \n Pyramids (Discworld #7) \n It\u0027s bad enough being new on the job, but Teppic hasn\u0027t a clue as to what a pharaoh is supposed to do.
