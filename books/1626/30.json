Pyramids? Dangerous things. Asking for trouble. I mean,\u0027 Pthagonal reached unsteadily for his wine cup, \u0027how long did they think they could go on building bigger and bigger pyramids for? I mean, where did they think power comes from? I mean,\u0027 he hiccuped, \u0027you\u0027ve been in that place, haven\u0027t you? Ever noticed how slow it all seems to be?\u0027\n \u0027Oh, yes,\u0027 said Teppic flatly.\n \u0027That\u0027s because the time is sucked up, see? Pyramids. So they have to flare it off. Flarelight, they call it. They think it looks pretty! It\u0027s their time they\u0027re burning off!\u0027\n \u0027All I know is the air feels as though it\u0027s been boiled in a sock,\u0027 said Teppic. \u0027And nothing actually changes, even if it doesn\u0027t stay the same.\n \u0027Right,\u0027 said Pthagonal. \u0027The reason being, it\u0027s past time. They use up past time, over and over again. The pyramids take all the new time. And if you don\u0027t let the pyramids flare, the power build up\u0027ll-\u0027\u0027 he paused. \u0027I suppose,\u0027 he went on, \u0027that it\u0027d escape along a wossname, a fracture. In space.\u0027\n \u0027I was there before the kingdom, er, went,\u0027 said Teppic. \u0027I thought I saw the big pyramid move.\u0027\n \u0027There you are then. It\u0027s probably moved the dimensions around by ninety degrees,\u0027 said Pthagonal, with the assurance of the truly drunk.\n \u0027You mean, so length is height and height is width?\u0027\n Pthagonal shook an unsteady finger.\n \u0027Nonono,\u0027 he said. \u0027So that length is height and height is breadth and breadth is width and width is a\u0027, he burped \u0027A \u0027time. S\u0027nother dimessnon, see? Four of the bastards. Time\u0027s one of them. Ninety thingys to the other three. Degrees is what I mean. Only, only, it can\u0027t exist in this world like that, so the place had to sort of pop outside for a bit, see? Otherwise you\u0027d have people getting older by walking sideways. He looked sadly into the depths of his cup. \u0027And every birthday you\u0027d age another mile,\u0027 he added. Teppic looked at him aghast.\n \u0027That\u0027s time and space for you,\u0027 Pthagonal went on. \u0027You can twist them all over the place if you\u0027re not careful. Three point one four one. What sort of a number d\u0027you call that?\u0027\n \u0027It sounds horrible,\u0027 said Teppic.\n \u0027Damn right. Somewhere,\u0027 Pthagonal was beginning to sway on his bench, \u0027somewhere someone built a universe with a decent, respectable value of, of,\u0027 he peered blankly at the table, \u0027of pie. Not some damn number that never comes to an end, what kind of a\u0027\n \u0027I meant, people getting older just by walking along!\u0027\n \u0027I dunno, though. You could have a stroll back to where you were eighteen. Or wander up and see what you are going to look like when you\u0027re seventy. Travelling in width, though, that\u0027d be the real trick.\u0027\n Pthagonal smiled vacantly and then, very slowly, keeled over into his dinner, some of which moved out of the way.[28]\n Teppic became aware that the philosophic din around him had subsided a bit. He stared along the line until he spotted Ibid.\n \u0027It won\u0027t work,\u0027 said Ibid. \u0027The Tyrant won\u0027t listen to us. Nor will the people. Anyway\u0027 he glanced at Antiphon - \u0027we\u0027re not all of one mind on the subject.\u0027\n \u0027Damn Tsorteans need teaching a lesson,\u0027 said Antiphon sternly. \u0027Not room for two major powers on this continent. Damn bad sports, anyway, just because we stole their queen. Youthful high spirits, love will have its way\u0027\n Copolymer woke up.\n \u0027You\u0027ve got it wrong,\u0027 he said mildly. \u0027The great war, that was because they stole our queen. What was her name now, face that launched a thousand camels, began with an A or a T or-\u0027\n \u0027Did they?\u0027 shouted Antiphon. \u0027The bastards!\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m reasonably certain,\u0027 said Copolymer.\n Teppic sagged, and turned to Endos the Listener. He was still eating his dinner, with the air of one who is determined to preserve his digestion.\n \u0027Endos?\u0027\n The Listener laid his knife and fork carefully on either side of his plate.\n \u0027Yes?\u0027\n \u0027They\u0027re really all mad, aren\u0027t they?\u0027 said Teppic wearily. \u0027That\u0027s extremely interesting,\u0027 said Endos. \u0027Do go on.\u0027 He reached shyly into his toga and brought forth a scrap of parchment, which he pushed gently towards Teppic.\n \u0027What\u0027s this?\u0027\n \u0027My bill,\u0027 said Endos. \u0027Five minutes Attentive Listening. Most of my gentlemen have monthly accounts, but I understand you\u0027ll be leaving in the morning?\u0027\n Teppic gave up. He wandered away from the table and into the cold garden surrounding the citadel of Ephebe. White marble statues of ancient Ephebians doing heroic things with no clothes on protruded through the greenery and, here and there, there were statues of Ephebian gods. It was hard to tell the difference. Teppic knew that Dios had hard words to say about the Ephebians for having gods that looked just like people. If the gods looked just like everyone else, he used to say, how would people know how to treat them?\n Teppic had rather liked the idea. According to legend the Ephebians\u0027 gods were just like humans, except that they used their godhood to get up to things humans didn\u0027t have the nerve to do. A favourite trick of Ephebian gods, he recalled, was turning into some animal in order to gain the favours of highly-placed Ephebian women. And one of them had reputedly turned himself into a golden shower in pursuit of his intended. All this raised interesting questions about everyday night life in sophisticated Ephebe.\n He found Ptraci sitting on the grass under a poplar tree, feeding the tortoise. He gave it a suspicious look, in case it was a god trying it on. It did not look like a god. If it was a god, it was putting on an incredibly good act.\n She was feeding it a lettuce leaf.\n \u0027Dear little ptortoise,\u0027 she said, and then looked up. \u0027Oh, it\u0027s you,\u0027 she said flatly.\n \u0027You didn\u0027t miss much,\u0027 said Teppic, sagging on to the grass. \u0027They\u0027re a bunch of maniacs. When I left they were smashing the plates.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s ptraditional at the end of an Ephebian meal,\u0027 said Ptraci.\n Teppic thought about this. \u0027Why not before?\u0027 he said.\n \u0027And then they probably dance to the sound of the bourzuki,\u0027 Ptraci added. \u0027I think it\u0027s a sort of dog.\u0027\n Teppic sat with his head in his hands.\n \u0027I must say you speak Ephebian well,\u0027 he said. \u0027Pthank you.\u0027\n \u0027Just a trace of an accent, though.\u0027\n \u0027Languages is part of the ptraining,\u0027 she said. \u0027And my grandmother told me that a ptrace of foreign accent is more fascinating.\u0027\n \u0027We learned the same thing,\u0027 said Teppic. \u0027An assassin should always be slightly foreign, no matter where he is. I\u0027m good at that part,\u0027 he added bitterly.\n She began to massage his neck.\n \u0027I went down to the harbour,\u0027 she said. \u0027There\u0027s those things like big rafts, you know, camels of the sea\u0027\n \u0027Ships,\u0027 said Teppic.\n \u0027And they go everywhere. We could go anywhere we want. The world is our pthing with pearls in it, if we like.\u0027\n Teppic told her about Pthagonal\u0027s theory. She didn\u0027t seem surprised.\n \u0027Like an old pond where no new water comes in,\u0027 she observed. \u0027So everyone goes round and round in the same old puddle. All the ptime you live has been lived already. It must be like other people\u0027s bathwater.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m going to go back.\u0027\n Her fingers stopped their skilled kneading of his muscles.\n \u0027We could go anywhere,\u0027 she repeated. \u0027We\u0027ve got ptrades, we could sell that camel. You could show me that Ankh-Morpork place. It sounds interesting.\u0027\n Teppic wondered what effect Ankh-Morpork would have on the girl. Then he wondered what effect she would have on the city. She was definitely flowering. Back in the Old Kingdom she\u0027d never apparently had any original thoughts beyond the choice of the next grape to peel, but since she was outside she seemed to have changed. Her jaw hadn\u0027t changed, it was still quite small and, he had to admit, very pretty. But somehow it was more noticeable. She used to look at the ground when she spoke to him. She still didn\u0027t always look at him when she spoke to him, but now it was because she was thinking about something else.\n He found he kept wanting to say, politely, without stressing it in any way, just as a very gentle reminder, that he was king. But he had a feeling that she\u0027d say she hadn\u0027t heard, and would he please repeat it, and if she looked at him he\u0027d never be able to say it twice.\n \u0027You could go,\u0027 he said. \u0027You\u0027d get on well. I could give you a few names and addresses.\u0027\n \u0027And what would you do?\u0027\n \u0027I dread to think what\u0027s going on back home,\u0027 said Teppic. \u0027I ought to do something.\u0027\n \u0027You can\u0027t. Why ptry? Even if you didn\u0027t want to be an assassin there\u0027s lots of pthings you could do. And you said the man said it\u0027s not a place people could get into any more. I hate pyramids.\u0027\n \u0027Surely there\u0027s people there you care about?\u0027\n Ptraci shrugged. \u0027If they\u0027re dead there\u0027s nothing I can do about it,\u0027 she said. \u0027And if they\u0027re alive, there\u0027s nothing I \u0027can do about it. So I shan\u0027t.\u0027\n Teppic stared at her in a species of horrified admiration. It was a beautiful summary of things as they were. He just couldn\u0027t bring himself to think that way. His body had been away for seven years but his blood had been in the kingdom for a thousand times longer. Certainly he\u0027d wanted to leave it behind, but that was the whole point. It would have been there. Even if he\u0027d avoided it for the rest of his life, it would have still been a sort of anchor.\n \u0027I feel so wretched about it,\u0027 he repeated. \u0027I\u0027m sorry. That\u0027s all there is to it. Even to go back for five minutes, just to say, well, that I\u0027m not coming back. That\u0027d be enough. It\u0027s probably all my fault.\u0027\n \u0027But there isn\u0027t a way back! You\u0027ll just hang around sadly, like those deposed kings you ptold me about. You know, with pthreadbare cloaks and always begging for their food in a high-class way. There\u0027s nothing more useless than a king without a kingdom, you said. Just think about it.\u0027\n They wandered through the sunset streets of the city, and towards the harbour. All streets in the city led towards the harbour.\n Someone was just putting a torch to the lighthouse, which was one of the More Than Seven Wonders of the World and had been built to a design by Pthagonal using the Golden Rule and the Five Aesthetic Principles. Unfortunately it had then been built in the wrong place because putting it in the right place would have spoiled the look of the harbour, but it was generally agreed by mariners to be a very beautiful lighthouse and something to look at while they were waiting to be towed off the rocks.\n The harbour below it was thronged with ships. Teppic and Ptraci picked their way past crates and bundles until they reached the long curved guard wall, harbour calm on one side, choppy with waves on the other. Above them the lighthouse flared and sparked.\n Those boats would be going to places he\u0027d only ever heard of, he knew. The Ephebians were great traders. He could go back to Ankh and get his diploma, and then the world would indeed be the mollusc of his choice and he had any amount of knives to open it with.\n Ptraci put her hand in his.\n And there\u0027d be none of this marrying relatives business. The months in Djelibeybi already seemed like a dream, one of those circular dreams that you never quite seem able to shake off and which make insomnia an attractive prospect. Whereas here was a future, unrolling in front of him like a carpet.\n What a chap needed at a time like this was a sign, some sort of book of instructions. The trouble with life was that you didn\u0027t get a chance to practise before doing it for real. You only-\n \u0027Good grief? It\u0027s Teppic, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 The voice was addressing him from ankle height. A head appeared over the stone of the jetty, quickly followed by its body. An extremely richly dressed body, one on which no expense had been spared in the way of gems, furs, silks and laces, provided that all of them, every single one, was black. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pyramids-discworld-7/page-30.html","bookId":1626,"book":{"id":1626,"title":"Pyramids (Discworld #7)","description":"Storyline: \n Pyramids (Discworld #7) \n It\u0027s bad enough being new on the job, but Teppic hasn\u0027t a clue as to what a pharaoh is supposed to do.
