{"id":95685,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"Teppic lay on the strata of his bed, listening intently.\\n\\n There were two guards outside the door, and another two on the balcony outside, and - he was impressed at Dios\u0027s forethought - one on the roof. He could hear them trying to make no noise.\\n\\n He\u0027d hardly been able to protest. If black-clad miscreants were getting into the palace, then the person of the king had to be protected. It was undeniable.\\n\\n He slipped off the solid mattress and glided through the twilight to the statue of Bast the Cat-Headed God in the corner, twisted off the head, and pulled out his assassin\u0027s costume. He dressed quickly, cursing the lack of mirrors, and then padded across and lurked behind a pillar.\\n\\n The only problem, as far as he could see, was not laughing. Being a soldier in Djelibeybi was not a high risk job. There was never a hint of internal rebellion and, since either neighbour could crush the kingdom instantly by force of arms, there was no real point in selecting keen and belligerent warriors. In fact, the last thing the priesthood wanted was enthusiastic soldiers. Enthusiastic soldiers with no fighting to do soon get bored and start thinking dangerous thoughts, like how much better they could run the country.\\n\\n Instead the job attracted big, solid men, the kind of men who could stand stock still for hours at a time without getting bored, men with the build of an ox and the mental processes to match. Excellent bladder control was also desirable.\\n\\n He stepped out on to the balcony.\\n\\n Teppic had learned how not to move stealthily. Millions of years of being eaten by creatures that know how to move stealthily has made humanity very good at spotting stealthy movement. Nor was it enough to make no noise, because little moving patches of silence always aroused suspicion. The trick was to glide through the night with a quiet reassurance, just like the air did.\\n\\n There was a guard standing just outside the room. Teppic drifted past him and climbed carefully up the wall. It had been decorated with a complex bas relief of the triumphs of past monarchs, so Teppic used his family to give him a leg up.\\n\\n The breeze was blowing off the desert as he swung his legs over the parapet and walked silently across the roof, which was still hot underfoot. The air had a recently-cooked smell, tinted with spice.\\n\\n It was a strange feeling, to be creeping across the roof of your own palace, trying to avoid your own guards, engaged on a mission in direct contravention of your own decree and knowing that if you were caught you would have yourself thrown to the sacred crocodiles. After all, he\u0027d apparently already instructed that he was to be shown no mercy if he was captured.\\n\\n Somehow it added an extra thrill.\\n\\n There was freedom of a sort up here on the rooftops, the only kind of freedom available to a king of the valley. It occurred to Teppic that the landless peasants down on the delta had more freedom than he did, although the seditious and non-kingly side of him said, yes, freedom to catch any diseases of their choice, starve as much as they wanted, and die of whatever dreadful ague took their fancy. But freedom, of a sort.\\n\\n A faint noise in the huge silence of the night drew him to the riverward edge of the roof. The Djel sprawled in the moonlight, broad and oily.\\n\\n There was a boat in midstream, heading back from the far bank and the necropolis. There was no mistaking the figure at the oars. The flarelight gleamed off his bald head.\\n\\n One day, Teppic thought, I\u0027ll follow him. I\u0027ll find out what it is he does over there.\\n\\n If he goes over in daylight, of course.\\n\\n In daylight the necropolis was merely gloomy, as though the whole universe had shut down for early-closing. He\u0027d even explored it, wandering through streets and alleys that contrived to be still and dusty no matter what the weather was on the other, the living side of the water. There was always a breathless feel about it, which was probably not to be wondered at. Assassins liked the night on general principles, but the night of the necropolis was something else. Or rather, it was the same thing, but a lot more of it. Besides, it was the only city anywhere on the Disc where an assassin couldn\u0027t find employment.\\n\\n He reached the light well that opened on the embalmers\u0027 courtyard and peered down. A moment later he landed lightly on the floor and slipped into the room of cases.\\n\\n \u0027Hallo, lad.\u0027\\n\\n Teppic opened the lid of the case. It was still empty.\\n\\n \u0027She\u0027s in one of the ones at the back,\u0027 said the king. \u0027Never had much of a sense of direction.\u0027\\n\\n It was a great big palace. Teppic could barely find his way around it by daylight. He considered his chances of carrying out a search in pitch darkness.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s a family trait, you know. Your grandad had to have Left and Right painted on his sandals, it was that bad. It\u0027s lucky for you that you take after your mother in that respect.\u0027\\n\\n It was strange. She didn\u0027t talk, she chattered. She didn\u0027t seem to be able to hold a simple thought in her head for more than about ten seconds. Her brain appeared to be wired directly to her mouth, so that as soon as a thought entered her head she spoke it out loud. Compared to the ladies he had met at soirees in Ankh, who delighted in entertaining young assassins and fed them expensive delicacies and talked to them of high and delicate matters while their eyes sparkled like carborundum drills and their lips began to glisten compared to them, she was as empty as a, as a, well, as an empty thing. Nevertheless, he found he desperately wanted to find her. The sheer undemandingness of her was like a drug. The memory of her bosom was quite beside the point.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m glad you\u0027ve come back for her,\u0027 said the king vaguely.\\n\\n \u0027She\u0027s your sister, you know. Half sister, that is. Sometimes I wish I\u0027d married her mother, but you see she wasn\u0027t royal. Very bright woman, her mother.\u0027\\n\\n Teppic listened hard. There it was again: a faint breathing noise, only heard at all because of the deep silence of the night. He worked his way to the back of the room, listened again, and lifted the lid of a case.\\n\\n Ptraci was curled up on the bottom, fast asleep with her head on her arm.\\n\\n He leaned the lid carefully against the wall and touched her hair. She muttered something in her sleep, and settled into a more comfortable position.\\n\\n \u0027Er, I think you\u0027d better wake up,\u0027 he whispered.\\n\\n She changed position again and muttered something like: \u0027Wstflgl.\u0027\\n\\n Teppic hesitated. Neither his tutors nor Dios had prepared him for this. He knew at least seventy different ways of killing a sleeping person, but none to wake them up first.\\n\\n He prodded her in what looked like the least embarrassing area of her skin. She opened her eyes.\\n\\n \u0027Oh,\u0027 she said. \u0027It\u0027s you.\u0027 And she yawned.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve come to take you away,\u0027 said Teppic. \u0027You\u0027ve been asleep all day.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I heard someone talking,\u0027 she said, stretching in a fashion that made Teppic look away hurriedly. \u0027It was that priest, the one with the face like a bald eagle. He\u0027s really horrible.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He is, isn\u0027t he?\u0027 agreed Teppic, intensely relieved to hear it said.\\n\\n \u0027So I just kept quiet. And there was the king. The new king.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh. He was down here, was he?\u0027 said Teppic weakly. The bitterness in her voice was like a Number Four stabbing knife in his heart.\\n\\n \u0027All the girls say he\u0027s really weird,\u0027 she added, as he helped her out of the case. \u0027You can touch me, you know. I\u0027m not made of china.\u0027\\n\\n He steadied her arm, feeling in sore need of a cold bath and a quick run around the rooftops.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re an assassin, aren\u0027t you,\u0027 she went on. \u0027I remembered that after you\u0027d gone. An assassin from foreign parts. All that black. Have you come to kill the king?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I wish I could,\u0027 said Teppic. \u0027He\u0027s really beginning to get on my nerves. Look, could you take your bangles off?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They make such a noise when you walk.\u0027 Even Ptraci\u0027s earrings appeared to chime the hours when she moved her head.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t want to,\u0027 she said. \u0027I\u0027d feel naked without them.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re nearly naked with them,\u0027 hissed Teppic. \u0027Please!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027She can play the dulcimer,\u0027 said the ghost of Teppicymon XXVII, apropos of nothing much. \u0027Not very well, mind you. She\u0027s up to page five of “Little Pieces for Tiny Fingers”.\u0027\\n\\n Teppic crept to the passage leading out of the embalming room and listened hard. Silence ruled in the palace, broken only by heavy breathing and the occasional clink behind him as Ptraci stripped herself of her jewellery. He crept back.\\n\\n \u0027Please hurry up,\u0027 he said, \u0027we haven\u0027t got a lot of-\u0027\\n\\n Ptraci was crying.\\n\\n \u0027Er,\u0027 said Teppic. \u0027Er.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Some of these were presents from my granny,\u0027 sniffed Ptraci. \u0027The old king gave me some, too. These earrings have been in my family for ever such a long time. How would you like it if you had to do it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You see, jewellery isn\u0027t just something she wears,\u0027 said the ghost of Teppicymon XXVII. \u0027It\u0027s part of who she is.\u0027 My word, he added to himself, that\u0027s probably an Insight. Why is it so much easier to think when you\u0027re dead?\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t wear any,\u0027 said Teppic.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ve got all those daggers and things.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, I need them to do my job.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well then.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Look, you don\u0027t have to leave them here, you can put them in my pouch,\u0027 he said. \u0027But we must be going. Please!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Goodbye,\u0027 said the ghost sadly, watching them sneak out to the courtyard. He floated back to his corpse, who wasn\u0027t the best of company.\\n\\n The breeze was stronger when they reached the roof. It was hotter, too, and dry.\\n\\n Across the river one or two of the older pyramids were already sending up their flares, but they were weak and looked wrong.\\n\\n \u0027I feel itchy,\u0027 said Ptraci. \u0027What\u0027s wrong?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It feels like we\u0027re in for a thunderstorm,\u0027 said Teppic, staring across the river at the Great Pyramid. Its blackness had intensified, so that it was a triangle of deeper darkness in the night. Figures were running around its base like lunatics watching their asylum burn.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s a thunderstorm?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Very hard to describe,\u0027 he said, in a preoccupied voice. \u0027Can you see what they\u0027re doing over there?\u0027\\n\\n Ptraci squinted across the river.\\n\\n \u0027They\u0027re very busy,\u0027 she said.\\n\\n \u0027Looks more like panic to me.\u0027\\n\\n A few more pyramids flared, but instead of roaring straight up the flames flickered and lashed backwards and forwards, driven by intangible winds.\\n\\n Teppic shook himself. \u0027Come on,\u0027 he said. \u0027Let\u0027s get you away from here.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I said we should have capped it this evening,\u0027 shouted Ptaclusp IIb above the screaming of the pyramid. \u0027I can\u0027t float it up now, the turbulence up there must be terrific!\u0027\\n\\n The ice of day was boiling off the black marble, which was already warm to the touch. He stared distractedly at the capstone on its cradle and then at his brother, who was still in his nightshirt.\\n\\n \u0027Where\u0027s father?\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027I sent one of us to go and wake him up,\u0027 said IIa.\\n\\n \u0027Who?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027One of you, actually.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh.\u0027 IIb stared again at the capstone. \u0027It\u0027s not that heavy,\u0027 he said. \u0027Two of us could manhandle it up there.\u0027 He gave his brother an enquiring look.\\n\\n \u0027You must be mad. Send some of the men to do it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They\u0027ve all run away-\u0027\\n\\n Down river another pyramid tried to flare, spluttered, and then ejected a screaming, ragged flame that arched across the sky and grounded near the top of the Great Pyramid itself.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s interfering with the others now!\u0027 shouted IIb. \u0027Come on. We\u0027ve got to flare it off, it\u0027s the only way!\u0027\\n\\n About a third of the way up the pyramid\u0027s flanks a crackling blue zigzag arced out and struck itself on a stone sphinx. The air above it boiled.\\n\\n The two brothers slung the stone between them and staggered to the scaffolding, while the dust around them whirled into strange shapes.\\n\\n \u0027Can you hear something?\u0027 said IIb, as they stumbled on to the first platform. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pyramids-discworld-7/page-21.html","bookId":1626,"book":{"id":1626,"title":"Pyramids (Discworld #7)","description":"Storyline: Pyramids (Discworld #7) \\n It\u0027s bad enough being new on the job, but Teppic hasn\u0027t a clue as to what a pharaoh is supposed to do.
