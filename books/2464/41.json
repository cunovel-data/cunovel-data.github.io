The tiles from the walls had cracked and fallen during the inferno and lay in piles of shards that clinked against my shoes. Jack\u0027s light stabbed out in a wan cone that couldn\u0027t penetrate the dust and soot suspended in the air. Bodies - grey piles of sacking, mostly, but with a telltale hand here or a charred tuft of hair there had been shoved onto the tracks in long untidy heaps. \"Good girl,\" Jack said. He ran up a stairwell two steps at a time. We tried to keep up but in the thick air we lacked his urgency and we fell behind until we were abandoned in the near-perfect dark, only our glowsticks illuminating our way. Ayaan tossed hers to me so she could have both hands free for her Kalashnikov. I brandished the two sticks above my head like torches. We came to a place where the bodies were piled up like unliving barricades and I picked my way carefully through, terrified that one of the twice dead would rise up behind me and grab me around the neck. Ayaan let the barrel of her weapon swing from left to right, up and down, sighting on each punctured head in turn. In time we emerged into the main concourse where we\u0027d seen Montclair Wilson give his State of the Union address. It was unrecognizable as a place where hundreds of people had once lived. The walls had been scraped bare, leaving chipped concrete behind. The ceiling had collapsed in places, dropping tons of plaster across the twenty-four hour token booth which sat twisted and abandoned. The dead there had been pushed rudely to the sides, making a wide aisle toward the stairwells that lead up to the street. The light up there beckoned and we didn\u0027t stick around. At the street level we found Times Square deserted, emptied of its shambling corpses. Every undead thing in Midtown must have been in on the invasion of Times Square but they were long gone now. Only Jack was there, turning in circles looking for signs or clues or something. I could see no sign of the struggle at all but Jack bent and picked up a random piece of paper trash off the street. He handed it to me without a word. It had been a flyer for a Broadway show once but someone had scribbled notes in the margin with a ballpoint pen. ALIVE - CAPTURED DEAD \u003d ORGANIZED! LEADER \u003d \"GARY\" MOVING UPTOWN \"Jack,\" I said, holding on to the note because I didn\u0027t want to just throw it away, not when it might be Jack\u0027s last connection to the people he had helped lead. \"There was nothing you could do. You couldn\u0027t save them.\" He stared at me while his mouth worried at a grimace. \"They\u0027re still alive,\" he said, finally, and waved away my protests. \"If the dead just wanted to kill them, they would have done it here instead of dragging them half way across the city for it. They\u0027ve been taken for a reason. Who is this \u0027Gary\u0027?\" he asked. \"Is he a survivor?\" \"He\u0027s - he\u0027s undead, but different from the others. He was a doctor and he knew how to avoid brain damage when he died, he... we met him a while back, I would have mentioned him, but - \" Jack stared deep into my eyes. \"There was a threat I didn\u0027t know about and you forgot to tell me.\" He took the note out of my hands. \"I\u0027m too busy to kick your ass right now, but I\u0027ll get to it.\" It was so unlike him to say such a thing I was rendered speechless. Luckily Ayaan could still talk. \"He is dead! Gary is dead! I put a bullet in his head. I did it myself. We watched him die. He is back now, though, and very dangerous.\" \"Yeah, I got that.\" Jack surveyed the empty square. He turned to the west, toward the river, and started walking at a good clip. I ran after him. He had questions. \"It would have taken an army to get through the defenses we built. How he got through the gate - do you know how he could do that?\" I shook my head. \"He couldn\u0027t hold things... he was a doctor, before he - well, before. He tried to help one of our wounded but he couldn\u0027t even wrap a bandage himself, his hands were too clumsy. I don\u0027t think he could have used power tools.\" \"Can he control the dead? Did you see him do that?\" \"No,\" I said. \"Nothing like that. He seemed harmless when we met him.\" \"They didn\u0027t organize themselves. It sounds to me like this guy has some tricks he didn\u0027t show you. Mind controlling the dead. Surviving a head shot. Tearing a carbon steel gate off its hinges with no tools. Now he has my people but apparently he\u0027s not going to just eat them or he would have done that here. He\u0027s creating facts on the ground and we\u0027ve got no intel at all.\" In no time we had reached the old National Guard barricade near Port Authority. Jack reached under the hood of the abandoned Armored Personnel Carrier there and popped a latch. He peered down into the big truck\u0027s engine and grunted. \"They\u0027ve got at least a half hour lead on us and it\u0027s getting longer while I talk to you. We\u0027re going to fix this, Dekalb. We\u0027re going to go after them and find them and I\u0027m going to get Marisol back. You can help me with that or you can leave. Your choice.\" He reached deep into the engine and twisted something. His arm went stiff with effort for a second and then he let go in a hurry as the engine turned over and coughed. It sputtered to silence again. \"Jack - you\u0027re talking about suicide,\" I tried, knowing that if anyone knew better than to play cowboy against these kinds of odds it had to be the ex-Ranger. \"I\u0027m not stupid, Dekalb. I\u0027m talking about recon. We don\u0027t aggress on them until we know what the facts are - that\u0027s SOP. For now I\u0027m just going up there to take a look.\" He popped open a repair kit mounted on the APC\u0027s nose and took out a long white fan belt. He had to climb up on top of the engine to install it, his arms deep in the mechanism. He tried the starter again and the vehicle roared and whined and finally settled down into a bone-rattling chug of life. He jumped down to the street again and then clambered up into the driver\u0027s position. I started to climb after him but he shook his head. \"No. Just me. This thing\u0027ll get me close but it\u0027s hard to keep inconspicuous. Eventually I\u0027ll have to abandon it and then I\u0027ll be tracking them on foot. You\u0027ll be no help to me then.\" That was fair enough. When it came to moving stealthily in an urban environment he\u0027d had the best training in the world and I\u0027d had none at all. He gunned the engine, flooding the street with black smoke, and put the APC in gear. He had to shout over the noise. \"Take Ayaan and get back to your boat. Go to Governors Island. If I\u0027m not there in twenty-four hours you\u0027re on your own.\" I nodded but he didn\u0027t wait for my reply. He engaged the vehicle\u0027s treads and headed north - toward the survivors.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/monster-island-zombies-1/page-41.html","bookId":2464,"book":{"id":2464,"title":"Monster Island (Zombies #1)","description":"Storyline: Monster Island (Zombies #1) It\u0027s one month after a global disaster. The most \"developed\" nations of the world have fallen to the shambling zombie masses. Only a few pockets of humanity survive — in places rife with high-powered weaponry, such as Somalia. In New York City, the dead walk the streets, driven by an insatiable hunger for all things living. One amongst them is different; though he shares their appetites he has retained his human intelligence. Alone among the mindless zombies, Gary Fleck is an eyewitness to the end of the world — and perhaps the evil genius behind it all. From the other side of the planet, a small but heavily-armed group of schoolgirls-turned-soldiers has come in search of desperately needed medicine. Dekalb, a former United Nations weapons inspector, leads them as their local guide. Ayaan, a crack shot at the age of sixteen, will stop at nothing to complete her mission. They think they are prepared for anything. On Monster Island they will find that there is something worse even than being undead, as Gary learns the true price of survival.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/monster-island-zombies-1.jpg","author":"David Wellington","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/monster-island-zombies-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:44 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:35:41 PM"}}
