{"id":81741,"no":56,"title":"Page 56","content":"The infamous Jack hung from the galleries, his motionless body twisting this way, now that. The blood that had spurted from his arteries was barely trickling out now. In his mind\u0027s eye Gary could see the golden energy of his life, once fierce and self-contained, turning to wisps of wan smoke, his body barely warmer than the air around him.\\n\\n A drop of blood fell from his dangling left hand and struck the flagstones with a soft spattering sound.\\n\\n \"So... I win,\" Gary said, not really sure what that meant. He sloshed backward into the welcoming embrace of his bath. His weight had become an issue of late - his bones complained when he stood up and forced them to accommodate all that extra fat tissue. It felt far better to just lie back in the formalin and let his natural buoyancy hold him up. \"It\u0027s over.\" It had been fifteen minutes since the last rocket-propelled grenade struck the broch. Ayaan must be out of ammunition. Dekalb and Jack were accounted for. The prisoners, according to Noseless, were scared but calm. In the entirety of New York City no one remained to challenge him. \"I win,\" he said again.\\n\\n Another drop of blood fell. Drip.\\n\\n Dekalb\u0027s jaw shook as he opened his mouth to speak. He visibly forced the words out. \"I suppose you do. So just finish me already. Eat me now and put me out of my misery.\"\\n\\n Gary grinned and rested his hands across his swollen belly. \"No,\" he said.\\n\\n \"...no?\"\\n\\n \"No.\" Gary nodded at Jack where the Army Ranger had turned as pale as a sheet. Drip. Drip. \"He\u0027s about to die. When he does he\u0027ll come back - as one of mine. Then I\u0027m going to let him eat you. It\u0027ll be awesome.\"\\n\\n Drip.\\n\\n Dekalb\u0027s stomach quaked, the muscles under his blood-soaked shirt moving violently as his chest heaved with fear. He would be having trouble controlling his bowels, Gary thought. He might shit himself. That would be amusing. Dekalb ran his hands down his front, trying to smooth away the shaking maybe or perhaps he was trying to wipe the sweat off his palms. He pushed his hands across his pockets and seemed to find something there. His wallet? His house keys? Something safe, comfortable, reassuring. Some false hope. His eyes were slits, though, hurt, lost and impotent. \"You... you don\u0027t have to do that. You didn\u0027t have to do any of this - Gary, there\u0027s still a chance. You can turn this around. Save the day.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, really?\" Gary sneered.\\n\\n \"Yeah.\" Dekalb sat down cross-legged on the lip of Gary\u0027s tub and rubbed at his face. \"You could... you control the dead. You could march them all into the ocean if you wanted. You could save us. You could save the human race.\"\\n\\n drip.\\n\\n Gary drew his head under the preserving fluid for a moment. Felt it fill his mouth, his nose, the labyrinth of his sinus cavity. He reared upward again and let the liquid drip out of his face before he went on. \"The human race. The living, you mean - the people who hate me. Who can\u0027t stand to look at me. Why is that, Dekalb? Why do I disgust you so much? Give me an honest answer to that, at least.\"\\n\\n The enemy at least thought before answering. \"Because you\u0027re just like us. You can talk, you can think - the restless dead out there, your army, we can look at them and think they\u0027re just animals. They don\u0027t know what they\u0027re doing. But you chose this.\"\\n\\n \"I chose it,\" Gary repeated. He hadn\u0027t considered that - he\u0027d always seen himself as a victim of circumstance. Pushed along by events until he ended up on top of them.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re human - you might as well be human. And you eat other humans. There\u0027s nothing complex about it. It\u0027s the oldest taboo in the book. You\u0027re a cannibal.\"\\n\\n Gary\u0027s stomach roiled at the thought. A dozen defenses for his actions sprung to his mind but he abandoned them at once - they were false. Dekalb was right, he had chosen to be who he was. It changed nothing. Anger clawed its way out of Gary\u0027s chest and into his mouth. He felt like spitting. \"You still don\u0027t get it, Dekalb. I\u0027m not the villain here. I\u0027m not a fucking monster. People have been trying to kill me almost since the day I was reborn - Ayaan and her girl scout troop from hell. Marisol, and because of Marisol, Jack over there. You came here to kill me today. There were others you don\u0027t even know about - one guy I thought was my friend, or at least my teacher. Why? Because I\u0027m unclean, unnatural? Because I\u0027m evil? I\u0027m not any of those things. I\u0027m just hungry,\" Gary roared. \"I have a right to exist, a right to stay alive as long as I can and that means I have to eat. That means I have a right to eat.\"\\n\\n drip.\\n\\n \"You can judge me all you want but here we are. I win. I\u0027m going to live forever - and you\u0027re going to die.\"\\n\\n drip.\\n\\n Jack\u0027s body began to convulse, the muscles staging a final protest. He quivered on his line, his shoulder smacking against the wall and sending him spinning. His mouth opened and a liquid cry of horror came out, a raw, wet animal sound that trailed off into a rattle. Partly the symphony of the damned and partly the wail of a newborn baby.\\n\\n Vomit flowed out of his nose and mouth. His chest gave one last spasmodic heave and then he just stopped. His systems shut down. He died.\\n\\n \"You have about a minute before he reanimates,\" Gary suggested, both of them staring at the brand new corpse. \"Any last requests?\"\\n\\n Dekalb laughed, a bitter explosive sound. He reached into his pocket and grabbed something there. Gary stirred but relaxed when he saw what Dekalb had found - a hand-rolled cigarette and a pack of matches.\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t know you smoked,\" Gary giggled.\\n\\n \"If I\u0027m going to start, now\u0027s the time.\" He tucked the cigarette between his lips and opened the matchbook. \"Osman - you never met him - gave this to me before I left Governors Island. He said it would relax me. Maybe it\u0027ll make it less painful to be eaten alive. But that would ruin your fun, wouldn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n Gary lifted one dripping arm in a dismissive gesture. \"I\u0027m not a complete asshole. Go for it. A last act of mercy.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks.\" Dekalb tore one of the paper matches free and put the head against the striking strip on the matchbook cover. \"By the way, somebody owes you an apology.\"\\n\\n \"Oh?\"\\n\\n Dekalb nodded, his absurd joint bobbing in his mouth. \"Yeah. Your teachers in med school. They forgot to tell you that formalin is highly flammable.\" The match struck and lit with a tiny hiss. Dekalb snapped it away from himself in a fluttering arc that dropped it right into Gary\u0027s bathtub. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/monster-island-zombies-1/page-56.html","bookId":2464,"book":{"id":2464,"title":"Monster Island (Zombies #1)","description":"Storyline: Monster Island (Zombies #1) \\n It\u0027s one month after a global disaster. The most \"developed\" nations of the world have fallen to the shambling zombie masses. Only a few pockets of humanity survive — in places rife with high-powered weaponry, such as Somalia. In New York City, the dead walk the streets, driven by an insatiable hunger for all things living. One amongst them is different; though he shares their appetites he has retained his human intelligence. Alone among the mindless zombies, Gary Fleck is an eyewitness to the end of the world — and perhaps the evil genius behind it all. From the other side of the planet, a small but heavily-armed group of schoolgirls-turned-soldiers has come in search of desperately needed medicine. Dekalb, a former United Nations weapons inspector, leads them as their local guide. Ayaan, a crack shot at the age of sixteen, will stop at nothing to complete her mission. They think they are prepared for anything. On Monster Island they will find that there is something worse even than being undead, as Gary learns the true price of survival.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/monster-island-zombies-1.jpg","author":"David Wellington","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/monster-island-zombies-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:44 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:35:41 PM"}}
