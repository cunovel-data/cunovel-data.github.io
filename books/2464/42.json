You can see the interview here and there\u0027s lots of other stuff worth checking out as well, including an interview with Brian Keene.\n --David Wellington\n Two mummies awaited Gary when he returned to the broch. They gestured for him to follow them - alone.\n There would be trouble, of course. Mael already knew what had happened. As they entered the compound the workers on the walls of the big tower had turned to see the procession, their hands dropping to their sides, the bricks they carried put aside to watch as hundreds of living humans marched fearfully into the very midst of undead central. The dead on their own had no curiosity - for all the eyes turned on Gary and his raiding party there was only one intelligence looking through them.\n Gary could understand Mael\u0027s surprise. The dead army was under strict orders not to let a single living thing enter Central Park, much less a crowd of them. Gary was breaking a serious taboo.\n He commanded his army to guard the prisoners and then stepped inside the shadowed spaces of the construction site. The walls were rising steadily: the dead never rested and Mael had a multitude of them to draw on. At the center of the building the Druid waited for him on his cairn-like throne. He did not look pleased.\n Now, lad, I know you\u0027re a smart one so you\u0027ll have no trouble explaining this: why my best servant would disobey my instructions so completely. You didn\u0027t forget what we\u0027re at, did you? The killing and all?\n \"I didn\u0027t forget.\" Gary came closer until he was face to face with the bog mummy, staring directly into the dark hollows of his eye sockets. The Druid didn\u0027t lift his head but the taibhsearan hanging from the walls craned their necks around to follow Gary as he moved.\n Then maybe you\u0027ve gone soft again. Is that it? Did you go all pale when you were on the catbird seat? I don\u0027t blame you feeling a little compassion, son, to be honest. If you want then I\u0027ll send my own creatures to do the dirty deed.\n Mael rose from his seat and hobbled toward the exit from the room. As he drew close to Gary he seemed to sense something. He stopped and raised his hand to pass it slowly over Gary\u0027s face.\n It wasn\u0027t compassion, then, oh, no. Gary knew what the Druid felt - the energy that ran through Gary like waves on the ocean, massive and deep and strong. It buzzed and shook within him and he felt as if he might split open at any moment. You ate what, twenty of them? Thirty?\n \"I needed the strength. Otherwise I would have spared even them.\" The men he\u0027d slain had been old or unfit one way or another. They couldn\u0027t help him achieve his desired end. \"Mael. I\u0027ve been thinking.\"\n Have you now? And what grand notion has you in its grasp?\n \"I need to know... I need to know what your plan is for me. For me and all the undead like me, the hungry ones. When the work is done and all the survivors are dead what will become of us?\"\n The Druid stroked his chin and paced back to his chair as the taibhsearan followed Gary\u0027s every fidget. You\u0027ll be rewarded, of course. I\u0027ll be giving you peace, peace and the satisfaction a man feels on completing a job of work.\n \"Peace? The only peace I know any more is a full stomach,\" Gary tried.\n Oh, lad, don\u0027t be dense. I know what you\u0027re driving at and it\u0027s unnatural. No creature should have to live forever. It\u0027s a curse. Take the peace I\u0027m offering. I wish it could be otherwise but there\u0027s only two sides in this thing: you\u0027re either with me or against me.\n Gary circled slowly around the throne, the seers on the walls craning their necks after him as he considered his next move. \"You\u0027re talking about the peace of the grave. When there aren\u0027t any people left there\u0027ll be no food for us to eat. You\u0027ll let us starve until we wither away to dust. Or no - no, you would see that as heartless. When the work is done, when the last living man is dead, you\u0027ll just cut us off. You\u0027ll suck out our dark energy and let us just drop where we stand like so much meat.\"\n Do you see another option, then?\n \"Yes!\" Gary crowed. \"It starts with those people, those living people out there. We stop killing them, at least, we stop killing all of them. Some of them we cull out for food but the rest we keep alive and safe from the dead. It\u0027s a renewable resource, Mael - they\u0027ll keep making babies. It doesn\u0027t matter how awful things get. Even in the middle of arma-fucking-geddon they still make babies. I can keep this going for - for as long as I care to.\"\n And if you do that, boy, my sacrifice will be wasted. My life and my death will have been for naught. No! I won\u0027t let you make me meaningless! Now do as you\u0027ve been told!\n \"I\u0027m done, Mael. I won\u0027t work for you any more,\" Gary said, looking down at his feet.\n The two mummies came at Gary with their hands up, clearly under orders to attack. Gary ducked under the arms of one of the mummies and saw an amulet tucked into her wrappings in the middle of her chest - her heart scarab. He tore it free and threw it away from him as hard as he could.\n In his head he could hear the mummy wailing for her magic charm. She ran after the amulet, leaving her partner to take care of Gary. It was easy enough to block the bandaged arms he tried to use like flails. Gary headbutted him hard enough to crack the Egyptian\u0027s ancient skull and the mummy went down in a heap.\n Mael waded into the battle then himself. The green sword crashed down against the back of Gary\u0027s head but he was ready for it and rolled with the impact. He dodged sideways and looked for an opening. He only had a few seconds, he knew, before Mael thought to call for reinforcements - thousands of them. Despite the energy blazing away inside Gary\u0027s dead veins he couldn\u0027t hold his own against an army of the undead. He also knew how strong Mael was and that given a chance the Druid could snap his neck with one hand. He needed an advantage and he needed it fast.\n Mael swung and the sword came down hard against the floor, shattering bricks to powder, missing Gary by inches as he rolled away. Take what\u0027s coming to you, boy! Gary covered his face with his arms but he knew that if Mael connected with the sword the blow would shatter his bones.\n Another swing - Gary dashed out of the way and felt his back collide with a stone wall. There was nowhere left to retreat. Mael came after him, looking down at him through the eyes of the taibhsearan.\n The weapon rose again and then stopped in mid-swing. In Balor\u0027s name, the Druid shrieked, it\u0027s gone dark as night! What have you done, lad?\n Gary held his hands tight across his face as he manipulated the eididh. His voice was softer than he meant to be when he spoke. \"I\u0027ve just told every ghoul in the Park to close their eyes,\" he said.\n The sword fell from Mael\u0027s hand. The Druid reached up to touch his empty orbits. He started to moan, a low mournful sound that rattled Gary\u0027s teeth so much he nearly lost his grasp on the dead. He could feel Mael trying to undo his command, mental shrieks probing at the taibhsearan up on the walls, desperate cries going out for the workers outside to come in and serve their master with their eyes. Gary had become too strong, though. He had eaten too many of the living.\n Gary rose slowly to his feet, careful not to make too much noise, and stepped up directly behind his erstwhile benefactor. It wasn\u0027t easy with his own eyes closed but he had made a point of memorizing where the Druid stood.\n \"I have a right to exist, Mael,\" he whispered.\n Oh, lad, and it\u0027s a wondrous clever thing you\u0027ve become. Gary could feel emotion radiating from the Druid\u0027s form like warmth. There was fear in there and some hatred and quite a bit of pride in his apostate pupil. Mostly though it was sorrow, genuine sorrow that his work was over.\n With shaking hands Gary reached out and grabbed Mael\u0027s head below the ears. It hung from his broken neck by little more than a flap of leathery skin. With one swift movement Gary tore it free. Mael\u0027s emaciated body slumped to the floor, as dead as when it had drifted in the cold water under a Scottish peat bog. The head buzzed in Gary\u0027s hand like something that might explode. It felt hot and cold and wet and dry all at the same time and he had a real urge to just cast it away but that would be real folly - Mael wasn\u0027t dead quite yet. Unsure if what he planned next would actually work, he raised the head to his lips as if it were a pumpkin and bit down hard. The ancient skull fragmented in his teeth and then a black river of screaming fluid tore through the world and carried Gary\u0027s consciousness away in its unrelenting current. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/monster-island-zombies-1/page-42.html","bookId":2464,"book":{"id":2464,"title":"Monster Island (Zombies #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Monster Island (Zombies #1) \n It\u0027s one month after a global disaster. The most \"developed\" nations of the world have fallen to the shambling zombie masses. Only a few pockets of humanity survive — in places rife with high-powered weaponry, such as Somalia. In New York City, the dead walk the streets, driven by an insatiable hunger for all things living.

From the other side of the planet, a small but heavily-armed group of schoolgirls-turned-soldiers has come in search of desperately needed medicine. Dekalb, a former United Nations weapons inspector, leads them as their local guide. Ayaan, a crack shot at the age of sixteen, will stop at nothing to complete her mission. They think they are prepared for anything. On Monster Island they will find that there is something worse even than being undead, as Gary learns the true price of survival.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/monster-island-zombies-1.jpg","author":"David Wellington","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/monster-island-zombies-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:44 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:35:41 PM"}}
