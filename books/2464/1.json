The GPS had died two months out to sea and in the fog we would be lucky not to crash into the side of Manhattan at full speed. With no harbor lights to follow and nothing at all on the radio he could only rely on dead reckoning and intuition. He shot me an anxious look. \"Naga amus, Dekalb,\" he said, shut up, though I hadn\u0027t said a word.\\n\\n He ran from one side of the deck to the other, pushing girls out of his way. I could barely see him through the mist when he reached the starboard rail, ropy coils of vapor wrapping around his feet, splattering the wood and glass of the foredeck with tiny beads of dew. The girls chattered and shrieked like they always did but in the claustrophobic fog they sounded like carrion birds squabbling over some prize giblets.\\n\\n Yusuf shouted something from the wheelhouse, something Osman clearly didn\u0027t want to hear. \"Hooyaa da was!\" the captain screamed back. Then, in English, \"quarter steam! Bring her down to quarter steam!\" He must have sensed something out in the murk.\\n\\n For whatever reason I turned then to look ahead and to port. The only thing over that way was a trio of the girls. In their uniforms they looked like a girl band gone horribly wrong. Grey headscarves, navy school blazers, plaid miniskirts, combat boots. AK-47s slung over their shoulders. Sixteen years old and armed to the teeth, the Glorious Girl Army of the Women\u0027s Republic of Somaliland. One of the girls raised her arm, pointed at something. She looked back at me as if for validation but I couldn\u0027t see anything out there. Then I did and I nodded agreeably. A hand rising from high above the sea. A bloated, enormous green hand holding a giant torch, the gold at the top dull in the fog.\\n\\n \"This is New York, yes, Mr. Dekalb? That is the famous Statue of Liberty.\" Ayaan didn\u0027t look me in the eye but she wasn\u0027t looking at the statue, either. She had the most English of any of the girls so she\u0027d acted as my interpreter on the voyage but we weren\u0027t exactly what you\u0027d call close. Ayaan wasn\u0027t close with anybody, unless you counted Mama Halima, the Warlady and President-for-Life of the WRS. She was supposed to be a crack shot with an AK and a ruthless killer. She still couldn\u0027t help but remind me of my daughter Sarah and the maniacs I\u0027d left her with back in Mogadishu. At least Sarah would only have to worry about human dangers. I had a personal guarantee from Mama Halima that she would be protected from the supernatural. Ayaan ignored my stare. \"They showed us the picture of the statue, in the madrassa. They made us spit on the picture.\"\\n\\n I ignored her as best I could and watched as the statue materialized out of the fog. Lady Liberty looked alright, about like how I\u0027d left her five years before. Long before the Epidemic began. I guess I\u0027d been expecting to see something, some sign of damage or decay but she had already rusted green before I was born. In the distance through the mist I could make out the pediment, the star-shaped base of the statue. It seemed impossibly real, hallucinatorily perfect and unblemished. In Africa I\u0027d seen so much horror I think I\u0027d forgotten what the West could be like with its sheen of normalcy and health.\\n\\n \"Fiir!\" one of the girls at the rail shouted. Ayaan and I pushed forward and stared into the mist. We could make out most of Liberty Island now and the shadow of Ellis Island beyond. The girls were pointing with agitation at the walkway that ringed Liberty, at the people there. American clothes, American hair exposed to the elements. Tourists, perhaps. Perhaps not.\\n\\n \"Osman,\" I shouted, \"Osman, we\u0027re getting too close,\" but the Captain just yelled for me to shut up again. On the walkway I saw hundreds of them, hundreds of people. They waved at us, their arms moving stiffly like something from a silent movie. They pushed toward the railing, pushed to get closer to us. As the trawler rolled closer I could see them crawling over one\\n\\n another in their desperation to touch us, to swarm onboard.\\n\\n I thought maybe, just maybe they were alright, maybe they\u0027d run to Liberty Island for refuge and been safe there and were just waiting for us, waiting for rescue but then I smelled them and I knew. I knew they weren\u0027t alright at all. Give me your tired, your poor, your wretched refuse, my brain repeated over and over, a mantra. I was butchering Emma Lazarus but I couldn\u0027t stop, my brain wouldn\u0027t stop. Give me your huddled masses. Huddled masses yearning to breathe. \"Osman! Turn away!\"\\n\\n One of them toppled over the side of the railing, maybe pushed by the straining crowd behind. A woman in a bright red windbreaker, her hair a matted lump on one side of her head. She tried desperately to dog-paddle toward the trawler but she was hindered by the fact that she kept reaching up, reaching up one bluish hand to try to grab at us. She wanted us so badly.\\n\\n Wanted to reach us, to touch us.\\n\\n Give me your tired, your so very, very tired. I couldn\u0027t take this, didn\u0027t know what I had thought I could accomplish coming here. I couldn\u0027t look at another one. Another dead person clawing for my face.\\n\\n One of the girls opened up with her rifle, a controlled burst, three shots. Chut chut chut chopping up the grey water. Chut chut chut and the bullets tore through the red windbreaker, tore open the woman\u0027s neck. Chut chut chut and her head popped open like an overripe melon and she sank, slipping beneath the water without a sound and still, pressed up against the railing on Liberty Island, a hundred more reached for us. Reached with pleading skeletal hands to clutch at us, to take what was theirs.\\n\\n Your huddled masses. Give me your dead, I thought. The ship heeled hard over to one side as Osman finally brought her around, nosed around the edge of Liberty Island and kept us from running up on the rocks. Give me your wretched dead, yearning to devour, your shambling masses. Give me. That was what they were thinking, wasn\u0027t it? The living dead over there on the island. If there was any spark left in their brains, any thought possible to decayed neurons it was this: give me. Give me. Give me your life, your warmth, your flesh. Give me.\\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/monster-island-zombies-1/page-1.html","bookId":2464,"book":{"id":2464,"title":"Monster Island (Zombies #1)","description":"Storyline: Monster Island (Zombies #1) \\n It\u0027s one month after a global disaster. The most \"developed\" nations of the world have fallen to the shambling zombie masses. Only a few pockets of humanity survive — in places rife with high-powered weaponry, such as Somalia. In New York City, the dead walk the streets, driven by an insatiable hunger for all things living. One amongst them is different; though he shares their appetites he has retained his human intelligence. Alone among the mindless zombies, Gary Fleck is an eyewitness to the end of the world — and perhaps the evil genius behind it all. From the other side of the planet, a small but heavily-armed group of schoolgirls-turned-soldiers has come in search of desperately needed medicine. Dekalb, a former United Nations weapons inspector, leads them as their local guide. Ayaan, a crack shot at the age of sixteen, will stop at nothing to complete her mission. They think they are prepared for anything. On Monster Island they will find that there is something worse even than being undead, as Gary learns the true price of survival.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/monster-island-zombies-1.jpg","author":"David Wellington","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/monster-island-zombies-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:44 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:35:41 PM"}}
