We took off our hazmat suits to make it easier to work and I waited patiently for Jack\u0027s instructions. He unzipped the big pack I had carried into Gary\u0027s fortress and took out a couple foil packets covered in warning stickers and small print type. I peered into the pack myself and had no idea what I was looking at. Other than the metal gas cylinders there were neat stacks of electronic components and bricks of something soft-looking and off-white. I did notice what was missing: guns. There weren\u0027t any firearms in there at all. No pistols, no assault rifles, no shotguns. No rocket launchers or sniper rifles or machine guns.\\n\\n No knives, either. The combat knife strapped to my suit\u0027s leg was the only weapon I could find. I unzipped Jack\u0027s pack, thinking maybe he had carried all the armaments because he didn\u0027t trust me not to accidentally shoot off my foot (a fair enough assertion, if that was what he had actually been thinking. It wasn\u0027t). He reached over and stopped my hand. \"I\u0027ll unload that,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Are you ready to tell me what we\u0027re doing?\" I asked, cautiously.\\n\\n \"No,\" he said.\\n\\n Pure Jack style. Just no, negative, unh-uh. He took the Iridium cell phone out of my pack and laid it on the floor after checking for probably the third time that it was set to vibrate and not to ring. \"One at a time, and very slowly, start handing me those bricks,\" he said, pointing to my pack.\\n\\n I took one out. It felt slightly powdery, like a crumbling bar of soap and it came wrapped in a thin sheet of plastic, like Saran wrap. I left a depression in the brick where I held it with my thumb but Jack didn\u0027t seem to mind. He stripped off the plastic and then picked up one of the compressed gas cylinders and wrapped the putty-like substance around the cylinder, smoothing it quite carefully. As he worked with it the stuff lost its powdery consistency and became rubbery and malleable.\\n\\n I had seen the stuff before. It\u0027s common enough and cheap enough that it regularly shows up in the arsenals of most developing countries. Not to mention terrorist training camps. \"That\u0027s semtex, right?\"\\n\\n Jack glared at me.\\n\\n Foolish me, I thought he was angry because I had used a European name for it. \"Sorry. C-4. Plastic explosive. You\u0027re going to blow Gary up.\"\\n\\n \"Something like that.\" He returned to his work, fashioning a charge around the end of a second cylinder.\\n\\n I had to know. I picked up one of the cylinders. It had a faded sticker near the nozzle showing two symbols. One was a triangle containing a broken test tube. Cartoon fumes rose from the point of breakage. The other symbol was a skull and crossbones.\\n\\n The foil packets contained two piece atropine auto-injectors. First aid in the event of a chemical weapons spill. \"What is it in those cylinders, sarin?\" I asked, very, very calmly.\\n\\n \"VX,\" he said, with something of a sniff. As if I had offended his professional pride. \"It\u0027s got an LD50 of ten milligrams, either inhaled or cutaneous.\"\\n\\n A lethal dose of one thirty thousandth of an ounce. One little droplet is all it takes. I knew a hell of a lot more about LD50s and cutaneous versus ocular exposure rates than I had ever wanted to. This stuff was my worst nightmare back when I was working as a weapons inspector. It would have been everybody\u0027s worst nightmare if anybody had ever been crazy enough to use it. Even Saddam Hussein, when he tried to wipe out the Kurds, had used less dangerous nerve agents than VX. The British invented it. They traded it to the US in exchange for the plans for the atomic bomb. It was that lethal.\\n\\n \"The military tried everything they had when the Epidemic broke out,\" Jack told me. \"There was a rumor they were going to nuke Manhattan but I guess they couldn\u0027t make it happen in time. They did try gassing Spanish Harlem. This is all that\u0027s left of the assets they brought down for that project.\"\\n\\n \"They used nerve gas against the living dead?\" I asked, incredulous. I suppose if I was put in the same position I might have grasped at straws, too. \"Did it... did it work?\"\\n\\n \"It should have. A dead guy is pretty much just a nervous system that can walk around and VX is a nerve agent. It short-circuits the acetylcholine cycle. It should have worked.\"\\n\\n Obviously it hadn\u0027t. If anything the military had probably wiped out any survivors holed up in the neighborhood while leaving the undead untouched. The things we do with the best of intentions... I shook my head. \"Then you aren\u0027t here to kill Gary at all.\"\\n\\n Jack reached into his own pack and pulled out a handgun, a Glock 9mm. He didn\u0027t point it at me, didn\u0027t threaten me at all. Very carefully, the barrel pointing at the wall the whole time, he placed it on the floor.\\n\\n \"I told you one time about my contingency plan. About how I used to think about killing them in their sleep.\" He continued to build the charges around the cylinders. I did nothing. I remembered quite well what he had said. It had scared me then - it scared me more now because now I knew he meant it. He went on. \"There\u0027s no hope for a rescue attempt, Dekalb. It just can\u0027t be done. I ran through a million scenarios in my head and there\u0027s no way the two of us come out alive.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t know that,\" I demanded.\\n\\n He blinked and looked away from me. \"Dekalb,\" he said, \"what\u0027s the crew carrying capacity of a Chinook helicopter with the seats taken out?\"\\n\\n My jaw opened and closed spasmodically. \"You don\u0027t - \" But he did. He knew the answer. Maybe a hundred people if you\u0027re not going very far. We could only rescue half the survivors, even if we made it that far.\\n\\n Jack clearly didn\u0027t want to have to choose which ones to leave behind.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s nothing to be gained by us dying like that. Still we can do something for the survivors. We can keep them from being his lunch. Or rather I can.\"\\n\\n He tossed me one of the atropine injector kits. If I was exposed to nerve gas the only thing that could save me - the only thing - was jabbing the enclosed hypodermics into my buttocks or thigh. If I hadn\u0027t been exposed to nerve gas but jabbed myself anyway, the atropine would kill me instead.\\n\\n \"You can get out of here. Go back the way we came. Meet up with Kreutzer and have him take you to the UN. Get the girls off of that rooftop. You can still complete your mission. You just have to let me complete mine.\"\\n\\n Which meant consigning two hundred men, women and children to their deaths.\\n\\n \"Dekalb - I only needed you to come this far because I couldn\u0027t carry all of this gear on my own. Now let me do you a favor. Just turn around and go.\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t know what to say. I definitely didn\u0027t know what to do. I most certainly had no idea what my next reaction was going to be. If I could have stepped out of my body and spoken with myself I would have advised against it.\\n\\n It was a kind of spur-of-the-moment thing.\\n\\n The Iridium cellphone buzzed with a small, unobtrusive sound. It vibrated against the flagstone stone floor, wobbling and dancing. It slid a few inches across the floor and stopped. It started up again a second later. This was Ayaan\u0027s signal to us, the message that she had drawn Gary\u0027s undead army to her position. Away from us. Jack and I both stared at the phone.\\n\\n We looked up at the same moment. I had my combat knife in my hand, pointed at his stomach. He had the Glock in his hand, pointed at my heart.\\n\\n I lunged.\\n\\n He fired. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/monster-island-zombies-1/page-54.html","bookId":2464,"book":{"id":2464,"title":"Monster Island (Zombies #1)","description":"Storyline: Monster Island (Zombies #1) \\n It\u0027s one month after a global disaster. The most \"developed\" nations of the world have fallen to the shambling zombie masses. Only a few pockets of humanity survive — in places rife with high-powered weaponry, such as Somalia. In New York City, the dead walk the streets, driven by an insatiable hunger for all things living. One amongst them is different; though he shares their appetites he has retained his human intelligence. Alone among the mindless zombies, Gary Fleck is an eyewitness to the end of the world — and perhaps the evil genius behind it all. From the other side of the planet, a small but heavily-armed group of schoolgirls-turned-soldiers has come in search of desperately needed medicine. Dekalb, a former United Nations weapons inspector, leads them as their local guide. Ayaan, a crack shot at the age of sixteen, will stop at nothing to complete her mission. They think they are prepared for anything. On Monster Island they will find that there is something worse even than being undead, as Gary learns the true price of survival.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/monster-island-zombies-1.jpg","author":"David Wellington","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/monster-island-zombies-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:44 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:35:41 PM"}}
