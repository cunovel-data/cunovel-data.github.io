{"id":81729,"no":44,"title":"Page 44","content":"One of the mummies brought the pregnant woman to Gary. She was tied into a wheelchair after she attempted to beat in the skull of one of her captors with a brick. Gary wondered how far she expected to get through a city full of the dead when she couldn\u0027t run or do more than waddle quickly. Her swollen belly lay in her lap as if she\u0027d stuffed a bowling ball up her shirt.\\n\\n The mummy pushed the wheelchair over to where Gary sat on a pile of bricks and waited patiently for Gary\u0027s next command. He took his time issuing it. He\u0027d been in a peaceful mood all morning, just contemplating the sky and the unfinished broch behind him and the new structures he had ordered built on the Great Lawn, not really thinking about anything. After the previous night he supposed he deserved a chance to rest.\\n\\n His body had been rigid with seizures for hours after he snacked on Mael, the dark energy he had liberated from the Druid sloshing back and forth in his belly and his head and his fingers until black lightning shot from his eyes and mouth. At least a hundred dead men outside the broch\u0027s walls had been consumed as he thrashed about trying to hold on to his spark - Mael\u0027s energy threatened to sunder him, to physically tear him to pieces and he reached out for their fleeting life force to sustain his scorched and bruised frame. He managed not to explode, somehow. After a few hours of shivering in a corner, his arms wrapped around his knees as his brain iterated through endless hallucinations and his eyes blind with the phosphor blare of the dark light he\u0027d seen he was finally able to stand upright and walk around a little bit again.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve gained weight,\" the pregnant woman said. Marisol, her name was Marisol. \"I guess that\u0027s what happens when you binge and forget to purge.\"\\n\\n \"Hmm?\" Gary looked up. He rubbed his temples and tried to snap out of it. These frozen times when he became locked in contemplation of his own navel were too much like death, like real death for comfort. \"I beg your pardon. I was miles away,\" he told her. He needed to do something, something physically real or he was likely to sink into reverie again. \"Let\u0027s take a stroll, shall we?\"\\n\\n The mummy pushed her wheelchair along as Gary ambled alongside the fifteen-foot wall that surrounded his new village. \"Did you enjoy your breakfast?\" Gary asked. He\u0027d made sure the prisoners were given plenty to eat. Tinned foods were commonplace in the emptied city but they were useless to the undead, who lacked the manual dexterity to use a can opener.\\n\\n \"Oh yeah,\" the woman said, stroking her belly as if it pained her. \"I just love cold clam chowder first thing in the morning. We need access to cooking equipment if you want us to eat. You ever heard of botulism?\"\\n\\n Gary smiled. \"Not only that, I\u0027ve seen it. I used to be a doctor. You can\u0027t have a fire because I can\u0027t risk you hurting yourselves.\"\\n\\n \"You can\u0027t watch us all the time. If we want to kill ourselves badly enough we\u0027ll do it. We\u0027ll just stop eating or... or we\u0027ll climb on top of this wall and jump off.\" The woman wouldn\u0027t meet his gaze.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re right. I can\u0027t stop you.\" Gary lead her out into a furrowed patch of earth. The mud of Central Park would grow just about anything - after decades of fertilization and aeration and intense loving care by professional gardeners the soil was rich and dark. A Rows of dusty weeds had already sprouted in the denuded earth now that Gary was present to keep the dead from consuming every living thing they saw. \"This area will be your garden. Eventually we hope you\u0027ll be able to produce all your own food. Fresh vegetables, Marisol. You can have fresh vegetables again. Imagine that.\"\\n\\n \"Are you deaf? I said we would kill ourselves rather than help you!\" The woman thrashed against the cords holding her into the chair. The mummy reached forward to restrain her but Gary shook his head. By rocking back and forth and throwing herself against her straps eventually Marisol managed to overturn her chair, spilling her sidewise across the moist dirt that smudged her face and flattened her hair.\\n\\n Gary helped her up himself with his hands under her armpits. \"I heard you. And I believe that maybe you would take your own life. Others will make their own choices.\"\\n\\n He lead her down a narrow lane between two rows of makeshift brick houses that were still under construction. He showed her the double thickness of the walls and the fiberglass installation stuffed between the two layers. They would be cozy in the winter and cool in the summer, he explained to her. Mostly they would be safe - the perimeter wall would keep the dead out. \"How could you not be happy here?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"For one thing there\u0027s the smell,\" she spat back.\\n\\n Gary smiled and squatted down on his haunches so he could look her in the face. She still wouldn\u0027t meet his gaze but it didn\u0027t matter. \"When I was working at the hospital I watched a lot of people die. Old people whose time was up, young people who barely knew where they were, struck down in accidents. Kids, I saw kids die because they didn\u0027t know any better than to eat Drano or jump out of windows. Just before they went they would always call me over to ask one last favor.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah?\" she sneered.\\n\\n \"Yes. It was always the same thing. \u0027Please, doctor, give me one more hour before I go. Give me one more minute.\u0027 People are easily frightened by death, Marisol, because it is so very long and our lives are so very short. I\u0027m offering your people a chance to have long, full lives. I can\u0027t bring back the world we\u0027ve lost. I can\u0027t give them gourmet dinners or luxury vacations or American Idol. But I can give them a chance to not be afraid all the time. A chance to start over fresh. A chance to have families - big families. That\u0027s a lot more than you offered them in your spider hole.\"\\n\\n \"And in exchange for all this? What do you get? My baby? You already ate my fucking husband!\" Her hair had fallen across her face and she blew it away, puffing out red cheeks hot with anger.\\n\\n \"Everything has a price. I only need about one meal a month, maybe even less if I\u0027m careful. That\u0027s not a lot to ask.\" He thought of Mael and his tribe in Orkney. They had taken turns being human sacrifices. It was something people could accept if you made it a necessity.\\n\\n \"Marisol, I\u0027m going to give you an option right now. It was your pregnancy that inspired all of this generosity I\u0027m feeling so I\u0027ll grant you one wish. You don\u0027t get to pick, though. I can make you the mayor of the last secure human village on earth.\"\\n\\n He bent close and let her smell his fetid breath. \"Or I can eat your face off right now. Don\u0027t answer yet, though, there\u0027s more! I\u0027ll make it painless. You won\u0027t feel a thing. I\u0027ll even make sure you don\u0027t come back. You\u0027ll just be dead.\" He grabbed the handholds of her wheelchair and spun her around and around. He was enjoying this. \"Dead, dead dead forever and ever and ever and ever and your body will rot away on the ground until the flies come and lay their maggot eggs in your cute little cheeks.\"\\n\\n When he stopped she was breathing hard. Her body shook visibly as if she were very cold and he could smell something stale and sharp rising from her pores. Nothing special, really. Just fear.\\n\\n \"So what\u0027ll it be, hmm?\" he asked. \"Do I get an early lunch today - or should I start referring to you as Ms. Mayor?\"\\n\\n Her eyes were thin lines of hatred. \"You bastard. I want the biggest silkiest sash that says MAYOR on it in rhinestones. I want people to know who sold them out.\"\\n\\n Gary smiled real big so she could see his teeth. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/monster-island-zombies-1/page-44.html","bookId":2464,"book":{"id":2464,"title":"Monster Island (Zombies #1)","description":"Storyline: Monster Island (Zombies #1) \\n It\u0027s one month after a global disaster. The most \"developed\" nations of the world have fallen to the shambling zombie masses. Only a few pockets of humanity survive — in places rife with high-powered weaponry, such as Somalia. In New York City, the dead walk the streets, driven by an insatiable hunger for all things living. One amongst them is different; though he shares their appetites he has retained his human intelligence. Alone among the mindless zombies, Gary Fleck is an eyewitness to the end of the world — and perhaps the evil genius behind it all. From the other side of the planet, a small but heavily-armed group of schoolgirls-turned-soldiers has come in search of desperately needed medicine. Dekalb, a former United Nations weapons inspector, leads them as their local guide. Ayaan, a crack shot at the age of sixteen, will stop at nothing to complete her mission. They think they are prepared for anything. On Monster Island they will find that there is something worse even than being undead, as Gary learns the true price of survival.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/monster-island-zombies-1.jpg","author":"David Wellington","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/monster-island-zombies-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:44 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:35:41 PM"}}
