{"id":43509,"no":32,"title":"GARHI","content":"A day in the tonga. Early in the morning through snow, and past forests where huge pines were felled by yesterday\u0027s storm; then, after descending a hill in a thaw that melted the clay soil into red mud, we came to a felted carpet of flowers as close as they could lie, without leaves; violets, and red and white tulips swaying on slender stems. And here again were the song of birds, and fragrance in the soft, clear air. \n \n Halting at noon at Kohala, we found a barber in the open street shaving and snipping his customers. In a cage hanging to the bough of a tree above his head a partridge was hopping about—black speckled with white, and gold-coloured wings. It had a strident cry like the setting of a saw. \n \n As soon as the last customer\u0027s beard was trimmed, the barber took down the cage and carried the bird to another spot whence we could hear its scream. \n \n Above the road lie dark cliffs; a rose-coloured waterfall of melted snow tumbled mixing with the clay—pink with lilac depths, and the foam iridescent in the sunbeams. The ruins of a large temple of green stone carved with myriads of fine lines stood in solitude at the edge of a wood, and the background was the mountain-range, the Himalayas, lost in the sky and bathed in blue light. Only a portico remains standing—a massive, enduring frame for the infinite distance of snow-capped giants. The stones have lost their hue; they are darkly streaked by the rains and a growth of grey and purple mosses, and russet or white lichens have eaten into the surface. \n \n All the architectural details are effaced; parasites and creepers have overgrown the old-world carvings. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2137/60445.html","bookId":483,"book":{"id":483,"title":"Enchanted India","description":"简介： The air is heavy with indefinable perfume.
