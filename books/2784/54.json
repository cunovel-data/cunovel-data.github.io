She pulled open the door when Dominic knocked again, and he grinned brightly, raising his eyebrows. “Too tired to get changed last night?”\n She glanced down and realized she still had her clothes on from the day before. “I didn’t think about it. Why are you up early?”\n “Because I’m starving! Breakfast is in order.”\n “Did you want me to make you something?”\n He laughed. “Of course not. Damn, girl, are you awake yet? Do you really think I’d drag you out of bed so you could cook? We’re going out for breakfast . . . just you and me.”\n Crossroads Diner was packed when they arrived, and much to the dismay of some waiting patrons, Dominic got a table right away. Looking through the menu, Haven ordered French toast while Dominic rattled off a list of eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, fruit, and toast. She wasn’t surprised because she was used to feeding him, but he smiled sheepishly anyway. “What can I say? I’m a growing boy.”\n “I think you’re done growing, Dom.”\n He laughed, pushing up his shirtsleeve and flexing his weak muscle. “I need fuel, though. These guns are the only ones I carry and they don’t come naturally, little sis.”\n “Little sis,” she said, echoing his words.\n “Yeah,” he said. “Someday you might make it official by marrying my shithead little brother.”\n She smiled at the thought.\n The waitress returned with their food, and the two of them ate. Despite the fact that the place was noisy, a comfortable silence surrounded their table.\n “Did you ever think it would be this way?” Dominic asked after a few minutes.\n “What way?”\n He waved his fork in the air, motioning all around them. “This way. Coming here, having a life, getting a family, meeting Carmine. All of it, really. Did you ever think this would happen?”\n She contemplated his question as he took a bite of food. “My mama said I’d end up somewhere like this, but I figured I was given the life I had so the most I could do was get used to it.”\n “I can relate,” Dominic said. “Did you know I was adopted?”\n She was caught off guard. “No.”\n “I am. My real mom . . . well, no, Maura was my real mom in every way that counted. The woman who birthed me was raped, and out I popped.”\n Haven’s mouth dropped open. “I was made the same way.”\n “I figured,” he said. “See, you and I aren’t that different. None of us are when it comes down to it. The only difference is my mom stumbled upon me at the right time and saved me from what could’ve been a disaster. I wonder all the time where I’d be if they hadn’t taken me in.”\n “You got lucky.”\n “I did,” he said. “You and Carmine aren’t that different, either. My brother’s a spoiled little shit—that’s why he’s picky. Everyone always catered to him. Not saying I was neglected, because I wasn’t, but Carmine received the kind of attention I never had to deal with.”\n “What kind of attention?”\n “Attention from, uh . . . Dad’s friends.” He glanced around to see if anyone was listening. “At my christening when I was a kid, there were about two dozen people. It was relaxed, a potluck at the house. Carmine’s christening was a few months after mine, and hundreds of people came to show their respect. It had to be catered and held in a reception hall.”\n Haven frowned. “That’s horrible.”\n “Not really,” he said. “I’m sure I was jealous then, but I don’t envy my brother. Before he could walk or talk, people were making plans for his future. I’m grateful I never had that kind of pressure.”\n “Why him?” she asked. “Why not you?”\n “Because he’s Dad’s son, a DeMarco, and that’s what they care about—the Italian blood.” He paused. “Or what they used to care about. I don’t know anymore. But anyway, to what I was saying. Carmine’s spoiled, but deep down he’s still a terrified little boy, trying to figure out where he belongs, just like you’re that girl looking for her place in the world. You two were searching for the same thing.”\n “You think?”\n “I know,” he said. “And my mom would’ve called that fate.”\n After leaving the diner, Dominic stopped by the Harper residence to pick up Tess. She threw a duffel bag into the back of the car and crossed her arms over her chest, her usual scowl on her face as she sat in the backseat in total silence.\n Once they reached the house, Tess thrust a shopping bag at Haven. “It’s a swimsuit.”\n She was taken aback. A gift? “Thank you, but I don’t need one.”\n Tess looked amused. “If you’re going to the lake with me, honey, you do need one.”\n “Lake?” Haven asked. “What lake?”\n “We’re heading down to Aurora Lake for the day,” Dominic said. “It’ll be a blast.”\n Haven glanced at the bag. “And I’m supposed to wear this?”\n Tess nodded. “Yes.”\n Haven went straight upstairs to her room and stripped out of her clothes, leaving them in a pile on the floor. The swimsuit was a black one-piece that tied around the neck, the bottom cut like shorts. Haven put it on and tied it the best she could, tugging at it to make sure she was covered.\n Aurora Lake was located in a valley ten minutes south of the Durante city limits. The community of Aurora surrounded it, a few hundred residents living along the twenty-seven miles of shoreline. Although the lake was man-made, much of the land beyond the homes remained untouched.\n Haven climbed out of the car and spotted the water in the distance. It went as far as she could see, wildly tall trees bordering it on all sides. Despite its enormity, something about the place put her at ease. Beyond the grassy lot they had parked on was tan sand, reminding her of the desert ground she’d been used to all her life.\n “Welcome to paradise . . . or as close as we get around here,” Dominic said, juggling some lounge chairs under his right arm. They headed toward the water, setting up on the sand in an area partially encased in shade. There wasn’t a cloud in sight, and the warm summer breeze felt nice on Haven’s skin.\n Dominic set out into the water while Tess stripped out of her clothes. Haven pulled hers off carefully and sat down, watching the few people who were already playing out on the lake. Someone started a game of volleyball after a few minutes, and Dominic and Tess joined the game while Haven relaxed under the sun’s rays.\n It didn’t take long for the temperature to rise, sweat trickling down Haven’s face. She grabbed a bottle of water from the cooler and took a drink when a familiar voice rang out. She coughed, gasping for air as the liquid went down her windpipe.\n “Excuse me?” she sputtered, coming face-to-face with Nicholas. She took a deep breath that burned her chest. “What did you say?”\n He stared at her as he plopped down in Tess’s lounge chair, kicking out his feet and getting comfortable. “I said I didn’t think Carmine would let you come down here.”\n Her eyes narrowed. “We’ve been through this. He doesn’t tell me what to do.”\n “Okay,” he said. “Then I’m surprised you would come here when he can’t. You know, because of trying to kill me and all.”\n That hadn’t crossed her mind. “This is where you live?”\n Nicholas pointed behind them at a white two-story house about a hundred yards away. It stuck out among the others, the paint fresher. “That would be my place, so technically speaking, you’re sitting in my yard right now.”\n “Oh, well, he didn’t try to kill you,” she said. “It was a misunderstanding.”\n He laughed dryly. “A misunderstanding? He’s seriously clouded your judgment.”\n “No, your judgment’s clouded. Carmine made mistakes, but he’s a good person. You shouldn’t sit there and pretend you’re innocent. It’s stupid! I wasn’t there and I know you’re both being ridiculous about this . . . this . . . rivalry thing. So get over yourself, because you can’t talk about him like that to me. I love him.”\n She stood and stomped away.\n “Haven, wait,” Nicholas called out as she walked to the edge of the water. She heard him behind her but didn’t acknowledge him. “Look, I just have a hard time believing he cares about anyone. I don’t like the idea of him taking advantage of your situation.”\n She glared at him when he stopped beside her. “You know nothing about my situation! Carmine’s supportive of me, so how dare you judge him when he’s braver than you’ll ever be!”\n Nicholas stared out at the lake. “So, uh . . .”\n “I don’t want to talk about it,” she said. “No more about Carmine.”\n “I wasn’t going to say anything about him,” he said. “I was going to ask if you were getting in the water.”\n “Oh. No.”\n “Why not?”\n “I can’t swim.”\n “You don’t have to swim to get your feet wet.” Nicholas pulled off his shirt and tossed it onto the sand. He took a few steps into the water, stopping to look at her when it reached his knees. “What are you waiting for?”\n “I don’t think so.”\n “Trust me.” She let out a sharp, cynical laugh the moment the words came from his lips, and he immediately backtracked. “Okay, don’t trust me. But do you really think I’m stupid enough to let you get hurt? I told you before—you’re nice and all, but I don’t plan to die over you. And I guarantee, if you drown, they’ll kill me.”\n Haven stood there for a moment longer before taking a few steps into the lake, her bare feet sinking into the soft earth. She stopped before the water reached her waist.\n “So why is six afraid of seven?” Nicholas asked, breaking the tension with a joke.\n She held her hands on the surface of the water. “I don’t know. Why?”\n “Because seven, eight, nine.” He smirked. “Get it? Seven ate nine.”\n She nodded. “I get it.”\n “But you didn’t laugh. You never laugh.”\n “It wasn’t funny.”\n He let out a heavy sigh. “Why did the boy throw his toast out the window?” She shrugged. “He wanted to see the butter fly.”\n “See the butter fly?” The joke dawned on her when the words came out. “Oh, like a butterfly.”\n “Yes, a butterfly. Why did the guy get fired from the orange juice factory?” Another shrug. “He couldn’t concentrate.”\n “Like the orange juice that’s made from concentrate?”\n He ran his hands down his face. “You’re hard to crack, you know. I’ve never failed at making someone laugh before. I may as well have asked why the chicken crossed the road.” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sempre-forever-1/page-54.html","bookId":2784,"book":{"id":2784,"title":"Sempre (Forever #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Sempre (Forever #1) \n THIS IS A STORY ABOUT SACRIFICE . . .
