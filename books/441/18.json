{"id":42467,"no":18,"title":"Chapter XVIII COMMITTED TO THE DEEP","content":"\"I\u0027M afraid it\u0027s a case with poor Barnes,\" said Dr. Conolly, in a low tone, as the whaler came alongside the yacht and my father climbed over the side. \"He\u0027s taken a turn for the worse, and I don\u0027t think he\u0027ll last till tomorrow. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Poor fellow! Is there no hope?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The doctor shook his head. \"I was doubtful from the first. The spear was a poisoned one; though the poison was undoubtedly stale, and therefore slow in action, it was none the less sure.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Can he be seen?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, he\u0027s quite conscious.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n I followed my father to the shelter-tent, under which the wounded seaman lay. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, Barnes, how goes it—better?\" he asked, with a forced cheerfulness. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, sir, though \u0027tain\u0027t no good making a fuss about it. My number\u0027s up.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nonsense, man! you\u0027ll soon be all right again, I hope.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All right aloft, sir, please God. I\u0027m real glad you\u0027ve come to see me, Cap\u0027n, for there\u0027ll be one or two little things I want squared up.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll do anything I can.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, sir, there\u0027s my medal for South Africa, with three clasps: would you mind accepting it as a kind o\u0027 keepsake from me? An\u0027 there\u0027s the good-conduct medal, too. That ain\u0027t of much account compared with t\u0027other, but p\u0027r\u0027aps Mister Reginald would \u0027ave it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Thank you, Barnes; but have you no friends to give them to?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Never a relation in the world, sir. There\u0027s my pension papers in my ditty-box; it\u0027s a matter of three quarters due to me. Will you see that my chum, Joe Dirham, draws it? I\u0027ve signed a paper about it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All right; I\u0027ll see to that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"An\u0027 my identity-paper. It\u0027ll fetch a shilling at the \u0027Register\u0027s\u0027 at the first home-port we touch. Joe might just as well \u0027ave that; \u0027tain\u0027t no good throwin\u0027 good money away, and, besides, it will make all square and above-board up at the Admiralty.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do you feel much pain?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Precious little, Cap\u0027n. As I said afore, it\u0027s no good makin\u0027 a fuss over it; a seaman with one leg ain\u0027t of no use to you, but\"—here his voice trembled a little—\"promise me, sir, that you\u0027ll bury me at sea, an\u0027 not on the island; it\u0027ll be a snug moorin\u0027 for me at the bottom of the lagoon. Now, Cap\u0027n, read somethin\u0027 out of the Book, an\u0027 say a prayer for me—I, never wasn\u0027t much in that line myself.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Somehow I felt unable to remain longer, so, shaking the seaman\u0027s thin hand, I went aft, leaving my father with him. \\n\\n \\n\\n The news of the state of poor Barnes cast a gloom over the ship, and any feeling of enthusiasm over the discovery of the treasure was smothered by the melancholy reflection that one of our comrades was on his deathbed. \\n\\n \\n\\n Next morning I was awakened by the sound of voices on deck. The sun had risen in a thick haze, and, though not a zephyr disturbed the surface of the lagoon, the air was cool and pleasant. Wondering what the sounds meant, and whether poor Barnes had gone, I slipped on my clothes and went on deck. \\n\\n \\n\\n Clustered round the tent were most of the crew, listening to the voice within, or whispering to each other in subdued tones. I went forward, and found my father, Dr. Conolly, and the bos\u0027n standing by the side of the temporary bunk on which poor Barnes lay. The dying seaman was fighting his battles o\u0027er again, shouting and talking in clear yet hurried tones. Now he was in the sweltering heat of a West African backwater, advancing with his shipmates to storm the stockade of a rebel chieftain; next he was serving a 4.7 gun with the Naval Brigade, his feeble hands clutching in grim pretence at the handspikes as the huge weapon on its unwieldy carriage was trained on the advancing Boers. Other episodes followed in quick succession, till the scene in the stockade where he received his fatal wound\u0027 seemed to exhaust his last flickering strength. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Can\u0027t you see it\u0027s getting quite dark?\" he exclaimed feebly. \"What\u0027s wrong with the bos\u0027n\u0027s mate? Why, hain\u0027t he piped the lamp-trimmers? ...Ah! that\u0027s better; the anchor-lamp\u0027s burnin\u0027 now, so we\u0027re brought up at last.... Turn it up a little, lads... That\u0027s it... Burning brightly now...\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The words died away in a long-drawn sigh. The doctor bent over the now motionless form\u0027 and placed a finger lightly on one eye. Then he shook his head. \"Cover him over, poor fellow; he\u0027s made his last voyage and reached the port aloft.\" \\n\\n * * * * * \\n\\n \\n\\n Two hours later, the whaler pushed off from the side of the \"Fortuna,\" with almost ever, man on board, and a still, shrouded form, covered with a union Jack, lying on a board athwartships, the grand and solemn words of the Burial Service for use at sea mingling with the soft splash of the oars as the men, keeping slow time, pulled the boat towards the deepest part of the lagoon. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"... Suffer us not, at our last hour, for any pains of death, to fall from Thee.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Way enough; toss oars,\" ordered the bos\u0027n in a low tone. \\n\\n \\n\\n The men raised their oars to a vertical position, as a last tribute to their shipmate, and the boat gradually began to lose way. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"... We therefore commit his body to the deep, to be turned into corruption, looking for the resurrection of the body, when the sea shall give up its dead....\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The bos\u0027n gave the signal, and the board was tilted up, and with a slight splash, the shrouded form slid into the water, leaving the union Jack fluttering in the boat. Instinctively I looked over the side, and followed the course of the weighted canvas that enclosed the mortal remains of poor Barnes, till the grey shroud turned a greenish tinge, and at length was lost in the depth of the lagoon. With heavy hearts we rowed back to the yacht. \\n\\n * * * * * \\n\\n \\n\\n Needless to say there was no work done on the wreck for the rest of that day, but, to banish the feeling of depression, all hands were kept busily employed, some on the repairs to the gig, others making and repairing canvas gear, while the two divers made a successful descent and recovered the lost anchor and cable. On coming up they reported that the anchor was actually balanced on the edge of a deep chasm, it being only by the merest chance that the ground tackle had not been irrecoverably lost. So delicate, in fact, was the position of the anchor, that the divers hesitated to approach it for fear that it might make a sudden descent and carry them with it over the abyss. \\n\\n \\n\\n Just before sunset a strong party went ashore to refill the barricoes. The doctor and I went with them, but no amount of persuasion could induce Yadillah to set foot upon the island again, and during our stay he kept firmly to his resolution. We noticed a curious fact in connection with the journey ashore. The water was tinged in colour, and had a strong, sulphurous smell, so that we argued there must have been a volcanic outlet somewhere in the neighbourhood, or, failing that, there was a tremendous natural agency still bottled up beneath the island, that before long must seek to escape by another violent upheaval. \\n\\n * * * * * \\n\\n \\n\\n Soon after daybreak on the following day the working-parties set out on their varied tasks, for, on account of the heat between the sea-soddened timbers of the wreck, it was decided to suspend work during the hottest part of the day. \\n\\n \\n\\n The whaler\u0027s crew, under the orders of my uncle, devoted themselves to the unloading and transporting of the iron pigs from the hold of the \"Fortuna,\" intending to replace them with bars of solid silver from the \"San Philipo\"; while a party of men, under my father and the bos\u0027n, went away in the now serviceable gig to survey the reef. \\n\\n \\n\\n I chose to go with the gig, which was certainly a more pleasant amusement than working inside a steaming wreck, for even at that early hour a thick vapour enveloped the \"San Philipo.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n For some distance the two boats kept company, the lighter boat towing a pair of sheers which were to be set up on the cliff to enable the pigs to be handled the more easily, while the whaler, in addition to being heavily laden with ballast from the yacht, carried a second pair of sheers to set up over the main hatchway of the wreck. \\n\\n \\n\\n Opposite the landing-place on the reef we cast off our share of the gear and rowed slowly by the ledge of rocks, my father keeping a sharp eye on the formation of the reef to see if any of the gaping crevices actually led to the open sea beyond. \\n\\n \\n\\n For nearly a mile and a half the rock rose sheer from the water\u0027s edge, and although the boat was backed into several winding gaps in the reef, in every case the attempt to find a channel proved fruitless. As we approached the spot where the reef joined the island, the rocks became lower, but the depth of water was so little, and the shoal extended so far from the reef, that it would have been impossible to bring the yacht up to the reef, even if a channel existed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Try the other end of the lagoon, sir,\" advised the bos\u0027n. \"We\u0027ve let that part alone up to the present.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There\u0027s no harm in trying, Mr. Wilkins,\" replied my father, \"though, if I remember rightly, the original coral reef was very irregular at that part, and stretched seawards for a considerable distance.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n When, after an hour\u0027s steady pulling, we arrived at the other end of the reef, we found that the rock was very similar to the rest, being pierced by many deep channels that, as usual, terminated in what the bos\u0027n termed \"blind alleys.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Three of these were explored without success, but the fourth, some twenty feet in width in its narrowest part, ran in a straight direction for nearly a hundred yards, the walls on either side gradually diminishing in height from twenty-five to less than ten feet. Its end terminated in a mass of broken stone, deposited as if by human agency, in a diagonal direction, affording great facilities for climbing. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It strikes me, sir,\" remarked Mr. Wilkins, \"that the sea is only a few feet beyond the rock. Listen! you can hear the waves bleating against the seaward side.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n It certainly struck the bos\u0027n, but in a totally different manner from that which he implied, for, without warning, a terrific blast of air, followed by a column of water, was forced through an orifice in the rock, Mr. Wilkins, who was standing upon one of the thwarts in order to make a more complete survey, being in the direct line of fire, received the full force of the discharge, and was knocked completely over the side of the boat, while the rest of us were drenched to the skin. \\n\\n \\n\\n The unfortunate bos\u0027n was quickly hauled on board, little the worse for his ducking, and the gig was backed off beyond the danger zone. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Experience does it!\" gasped the bos\u0027n, spitting out a mouthful of water; \"which is, I am told, the Latin for \u0027Experience makes fools wise.\u0027 Am I not right, Mr. Reginald?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, what has experience taught you?\" asked my father, laughing. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Only what I thought was the case before,\" replied the bos\u0027n. \"And that is, that there\u0027s a communication through this rock between the lagoon and the open sea.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t see how that can help us,\" remarked my father. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"May be, may be not, sir,\" observed Mr. Wilkins oracularly. \"But if you don\u0027t mind, sir, will you land here for a few minutes. We can manage it quite easily by the broken rocks at the side of the blowing-hole.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n We gained the summit of the reef without much difficulty. Here, as the bos\u0027n had expressed his opinion, a ledge, barely six feet in width, separated us from the open sea, while on either hand, at a distance of less than a hundred yards, a long reef ran at right angles to the main ledge, terminating in jagged points of disrupted coral nearly half a mile from where we stood. \\n\\n \\n\\n By the deep-blue colour of the water it was evident that there was plenty of depth between these two natural groynes, which formed ample protection from the heavy rollers that at every other point along the reef broke with a ceaseless roar. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027ve got your revolver with you, I see, sir,\" said the bos\u0027n. \"I\u0027m going to dive off and see what the rock looks like on the seaward side. There may be sharks about and there may not; but keep a bright look-out, and fire at one if it comes for me. Money,\" he added to the bowman of the gig, \"unreeve the painter and sling it ashore, will you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There, sir,\" he continued, \"I\u0027ll take a turn round the rock, and drop the free end of the rope in the water so that I can pull myself up; but keep a bright look-out, if you please.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Hastily divesting himself of his sodden garments, and placing them to dry on the hot stones, the bos\u0027n took a magnificent \"header,\" and cleft the water with hardly a splash. Quite two fathoms down he went before he turned and swam towards the rocky wall, keeping below the water at the same depth. Half a minute later he reappeared, and, shaking the water from his hair, he grasped the rope and came up hand over hand. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s all right, sir. Deep water both sides, and the rock full of holes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What do you mean?\" asked my father, unable to grasp the meaning of the bos\u0027n\u0027s words. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, sir, the \u0027Fortuna\u0027 can float easily on either side of this little neck of rock.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"On one side, I\u0027ll grant.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Aye, on both sides, once we make a way through.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, how do you propose to do it\u0027? Remove each piece of rock bit by bit, when the weight of the smallest is two tons at the very least—eh?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, sir,\" replied the bos\u0027n. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then how are you going to set about it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Blast it,\" said Mr. Wilkins emphatically. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2182/61623.html","bookId":441,"book":{"id":441,"title":"The Treasure of the \u0027San Philipo\u0027","description":"简介： I almost danced with delight at the information, vague as it appeared, for during the last three months news of my uncle\u0027s progress in search of the mysterious treasure that was to restore the fortunes of the family had been disappointingly scarce; a...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2182","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
