{"id":18546,"no":35,"title":"CHAPTER XXXIII. SHAPING MACHINES.","content":"Shaping machines as machine tools occupy a middle place between planing and slotting machines; their movements correspond more to those of slotting machines, while the operation of the tools is the same as in planing. Some of the advantages of shaping over planing machines for certain kinds of work are, because of the greater facilities afforded for presenting and holding small pieces, or those of irregular shape; the supports or tables having both vertical and horizontal faces to which pieces may be fastened, and the convenience of the mechanism for adjusting and feeding tools. \\n\\n \\n\\n Shaping machines are generally provided with adjustable vices, devices for planing circular forms, and other details which cannot be so conveniently employed with planing machines. Another feature of shaping machines is a positive range of the cutting stroke produced by crank motion, which permits tools to be stopped with precision at any point; this admits of planing [136] slots, keyways, and such work as cannot well be performed upon common planing machines. \\n\\n \\n\\n Shaping machines are divided into two classes, one modification with a lateral feed of the tools and cutter bar, technically called \"travelling head machines,\" the other class with a feed motion of the table which supports the work, called table-feeding machines. The first modification is adapted for long pieces to be planed transversely, such as toothed racks, connecting rods, and similar work; the second class to shorter pieces where much hand adjustment is required. \\n\\n \\n\\n An interesting study in connection with modern shaping machines is the principle of various devices called \u0027quick return\u0027 movements. Such devices consist of various modifications of slotted levers, and what is known as Whitworth\u0027s quick return motion. \\n\\n \\n\\n The intricacy of the subject renders it a difficult one to deal with except by the aid of diagrams, and as such mechanism may be inspected in almost any machine fitting shop, attention is called to the subject as one of the best that can be chosen for demonstration by diagrams. Problems of these variable speed movements are not only of great interest, but have a practical importance not found in many better known problems which take up time uselessly and have no application in a practical way. \\n\\n \\n\\n The remarks, given in a former place, relating to tools for turning, apply to those for planing as well, except that in planing tools greater rigidity and strength are required. \\n\\n \\n\\n (1.) Why are shaping machines better adapted than planing machines for planing slots, key-ways, and so on?—(2.) What objects are gained by a quick return motion of the cutter bar of shaping machines? \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2128/60274.html","bookId":485,"book":{"id":485,"title":"The Economy of Workshop Mainipulation","description":"简介： In adding another to the large number of books which treat upon Mechanics, and especially of that class devoted to what is called Mechanical Engineering, it will be proper to explain some of the reasons for preparing the present work; and as these ex...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2128","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
