{"id":18542,"no":31,"title":"CHAPTER XXIX. FITTING AND FINISHING.","content":"The fitting or finishing department of engineering establishments is generally regarded as the main one. Fitting processes, being the final ones in constructing machinery, are more nearly in connection with its use and application; they consist in the organisation or bringing together the results of other processes carried on in the draughting room, pattern shop, foundry, and smith shop. To the unskilled, or to those who do not take a comprehensive view of an engineering business as a whole, the finishing and fitting department seems to constitute the whole of machine manufacture—an impression which a learner should guard against, because nothing but a true understanding of the importance and relations of the different divisions of an establishment can enable them to be thoroughly or easily learned. Finishing, therefore, it must be borne in mind, is but one among several processes, and that the fitting department is but one out of four or more among which attention is to be divided. Finishing as a process is a secondary and not always an essential one; many parts of machinery are ready for use when forged or cast and do not require fitting; yet a finishing shop must in many respects be considered the leading department of an engineering establishment. Plans, drawings and estimates are always based on finished work, and when the parts have accurate dimensions; hence designs, drawings and estimates may be said to pass through the fitting shop and follow back to the foundry and smith shop, so that finishing, although the last process in the order of the work, is the first one after the drawings in every other sense; even the dimensions in pattern-making which seems farthest removed from finishing, are based upon fitting dimensions, and to a great extent must be modified [119]by the conditions of finishing. In casting and forging operations the material is treated while in a heated and expanded condition; the nature of these operations is such that accurate dimensions cannot be attained, so that both forgings and castings require to be made enough larger than their finished dimensions to allow for shrinkage and irregularities. Finishing as a process consists in cutting away this surplus material, and giving accurate dimensions to the parts of machinery when the material is at its natural temperature. Finishing operations being performed as said upon material at its normal temperature permits handling, gauging and fitting together of the parts of machinery, and as nearly all other processes involve heating, finishing may be called the cold processes of metal work. The operations of a fitting shop consist almost entirely of cutting, and grinding or abrading; a proposition that may seem novel, yet these operations comprehend nearly all that is performed in what is called fitting. Cutting processes may be divided into two classes: cylindrical cutting, as in turning, boring, and drilling, to produce circular forms; and plane cutting, as in planing, shaping, slotting and shearing, to produce plane or rectangular forms. Abrading or grinding processes may be applied to forms of any kind. To classify further—cutting machines may be divided into those wherein the tools move and the material is fixed, and those wherein the material is moved and the tools fixed, and machines which involve a compound movement of both the tools and the material acted upon. There is also a distinction between machine and hand cutting that may be noted. In machine cutting it is performed in true geometrical lines, the tools or material being moved by positive guides as in planing and turning; in hand operations, such as filing, scraping or chipping, the tools are moved without positive guidance, and act in irregular lines. To attempt a generalisation of the operations of the fitting shop in this manner may not seem a very practical means of understanding them, yet the application will be better understood as we go farther on. Cutting tools include nearly all that are employed in finishing; lathes, planing machines, drilling and boring machines, shaping, slotting and milling machines, come within this class. The machines named make up what are called standard tools, such [120]as are essential and are employed in all establishments where general machine manufacture is carried on. Such machines are constructed upon principles substantially the same in all countries, and have settled into a tolerably uniform arrangement of movements and parts. Besides the machine tools named, there are special machines to be found in most works, machines directed to the performance of certain work; by a particular adaptation such machines are rendered more effective, but they are by such adaptation unfitted for general purposes. General engineering work cannot consist in the production of duplicate pieces, nor in operations performed constantly in the same manner as in ordinary manufacturing; hence there has been much effort expended in adapting machines to general purposes—machines, which seldom avoid the objections of combination, pointed out in a previous chapter. The principal improvements and changes in machine fitting at the present time is in the application of special tools. A lathe, a planing machine, or drilling machine as a standard machine, must be adapted to a certain range of work, but it is evident that if such tools were specially arranged for either the largest or the smallest pieces that come within their capacity, more work could be performed in a given time and consequently at less expense. It is also evident that machine tools must be kept constantly at work in order to be profitable, and when there are not sufficient pieces of one kind to occupy a machine, it must be employed on various kinds of work; but whenever there are sufficient pieces of the same size upon which certain processes of a uniform character are to be performed, there is a gain by having machines constructed to conform as nearly as possible to the requirements of special work, and without reference to any other. It is now proposed to review the standard tools of a fitting shop, noticing the general principles of their construction and especially of their operation; not by drawings nor descriptions to show what a lathe or a planing machine is, nor how some particular engineer has constructed such tools, but upon the plan explained in the introduction, presuming the reader to be familiar with the names and purposes of standard machine tools. If he has not learned this much, and does not understand the names and general objects of the several operations carried [121]on in a fitting shop, he should proceed to acquaint himself thus far before troubling himself with books of any kind. (1.) Why cannot the parts of machinery be made to accurate dimensions by forging or casting?—(2.) What is the difference between hand tool and machine tool operation as to truth?—(3.) Why cannot hand-work be employed in duplicating the parts of machinery?—(4.) What is the difference between standard and special machine tools?","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2128/60270.html","bookId":485,"book":{"id":485,"title":"The Economy of Workshop Mainipulation","description":"简介： In adding another to the large number of books which treat upon Mechanics, and especially of that class devoted to what is called Mechanical Engineering, it will be proper to explain some of the reasons for preparing the present work; and as these ex...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2128","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
