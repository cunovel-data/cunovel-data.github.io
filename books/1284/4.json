{"id":30008,"no":4,"title":"4 \"WHAT GOES ON AROUND HERE?\"","content":"IN the patrol car Sergeant Dankwaerts was occupied with his thoughts, and they drove in silence along the Strand and up Chancery Lane and into Holborn. At Gamages they turned left into Hatton Garden and the car drew up near the neat white portals of the London Diamond Club. Bond followed his companion across the pavement to a smart door in (he centre of which was a well polished brass plate on which was engraved \u0027The House of Diamonds\u0027. And underneath \u0027Rufus B. Saye. Vice-President for Europe\u0027. Sergeant Dankwaerts rang the bell and a smart Jewish girl opened the door and led them across a thickly carpeted entrance hall into a panelled waiting-room. \n \"I am expecting Mr Saye any minute now,\" she said indifferently and went out and closed the door. \n The waiting-room was luxurious and, thanks to an unseasonable log-fire in the Adam fireplace, tropically hot. In the centre of the close-fitted dark red carpet there was a circular Sheraton rosewood table and six matching armchairs that Bond guessed were worth at least a thousand pounds. On the table were the latest magazines and several copies of the Kimberley Diamond News. Dankwaerts\u0027s eyes lit up when he saw these and he sat down and started to turn over the pages of the June issue. \n On each of the four walls was a large flower painting in a golden frame. Something almost three dimensional about these paintings caught Bond\u0027s attention and he walked over to examine one of them. It was not a painting, but a stylized arrangement of freshly cut flowers set behind glass in niches lined with copper-coloured velvet. The others were the same, and the four Water-ford vases in which the flowers stood were a perfect set. \n The room was very quiet except for the hypnotic tick of a large sunburst wall-clock and the soft murmur of voices from behind a door opposite the entrance. There was a click and the door opened a few inches and a voice with a thick foreign intonation expostulated volubly: \"Bud Mister Grunspan, why being so hard? Vee must all make a lifting, yes? I am telling you this vonderful stone gost me ten tousant pounts. Ten tousant! You ton\u0027t pelieff me? Bud I svear it. On my vort of honour.\" There was a negative pause and the voice made its final bid. \"Bedder still! I bet you fife pounts!\" \n There was the sound of laughter. \"Willy, you\u0027re a real card,\" said an American voice. \"But it\u0027s no dice. Be glad to help you, but that stone isn\u0027t worth more than nine thousand, and I\u0027ll give you a hundred on top of that for yourself. Now you go along and think about it. You won\u0027t get a better offer in The Street.\" \n The door opened and a stage American business man with pince-nez and a tightly buttoned mouth ushered out a small harassed-looking Jew with a large red rose in his button-hole. They looked startled at finding the waiting-room occupied and, with a muttered \"Pardon me\" to no one in particular, the American almost ran his companion across the room and out into the hall. The door closed behind them. \n Dankwaerts looked up at Bond and winked. \"That\u0027s the whole of the diamond business in a nutshell,\" he said. \"That was Willy Behrens, one of the best-known freelance brokers in The Street. I suppose the other man was Saye\u0027s buyer.\" He turned again to his paper, and Bond, resisting the impulse to light a cigarette, went back to his examination of the flower \u0027pictures\u0027. \n Suddenly the rich, carpeted, ticking silence of the room struck like a cuckoo clock. Simultaneously, a log fell in the grate, the sunburst clock on the wall chimed the half hour, the door was thrust open and a big, dark man took two quick steps in the room and stood looking sharply from one to the other. \n \"My name is Saye,\" he said harshly. \"What goes on around here? What do you want?\" \n The door was open behind him. Sergeant Dankwaerts rose to his feet and walked politely but firmly round the man and closed it. Then he returned to the middle of the room. \n \"I am Sergeant Dankwaerts of the Special Branch of Scotland Yard,\" he said in a quiet, peaceful voice. \"And this,\" he made a gesture towards Bond, \"is Sergeant James. I am making a routine inquiry about some stolen diamonds. It occurred to the Assistant Commissioner,\" the voice was of velvet, \"that you might be able to help us.\" \n \"Yes?\" said Mr Saye. He looked contemptuously from one to the other of these two underpaid flatfeet who had the effrontery to be taking up his time. \"Go ahead.\" \n While Sergeant Dankwaerts, in tones which to a law-breaker would have sounded menacingly level, and consulting from time to time a small black note-book, recited a story studded with \u0027on the i6th instant\u0027s\u0027 and \u0027it came to our knowledge\u0027s\u0027, Bond made an unconcealed examination of Mr Saye which appeared to perturb Mr Saye no more than the undertones of Sergeant Dankwaerts\u0027s recitation. \n Mr Saye was a large, compact man with the hardness of a chunk of quartz. He had a very square face whose sharp angles were accentuated by short, wiry black hair, cut en brosse and without side-whiskers. His eyebrows were black and straight, and tucked in below them there were two extremely sharp and steady black eyes. He was clean-shaven and his lips were a thin and rather wide straight line. The square chin was deeply cleft and the muscles bulged at the points of the jaw. He was dressed in a roomy, black, single-breasted suit, a white shirt and an almost bootlace-thin black tie, held in place by a gold tie-clip representing a spear. His long arms hung relaxed at his sides and terminated in two very large hands, now slightly curled inwards, whose backs showed black hair. His big feet, in expensive black shoes, looked to be about size 12. \n Bond summed him up as a tough and capable man who had triumphed in a variety of hard schools and who looked as if he was still serving in one of them. \n \"… and these are the stones we are particularly interested in,\" concluded Sergeant Dankwaerts. He referred to his black book. \"One 20 carat Wesselton. Two Fine Blue-whites of about 10 carats each. One 30 carat Yellow Premier. One 15 carat Top Cape and two 15 carat Cape unions.\" He paused. Then he looked up from his book and very sharply into Mr Saye\u0027s hard black eyes. \"Have any of those passed through your hands, Mr Saye, or through your firm in New York?\" he inquired softly. \n \"No,\" said Mr Saye flatly. \"They have not.\" He turned to the door behind him and opened it, \"And now, good afternoon, gentlemen.\" \n Without bothering any further with them he walked decisively out of the room and they heard his footsteps go rapidly up a few stairs. A door opened and banged shut and there was silence. \n Undismayed, Sergeant Dankwaerts slipped his note-book into his waistcoat pocket, picked up his hat and walked out into the hall and then out into the street. Bond followed him. \n They climbed into the patrol car and Bond gave the address of his flat off the King\u0027s Road. When the car was moving, Sergeant Dankwaerts relaxed his official face. He turned to Bond. He looked amused. \"I quite enjoyed that,\" he said cheerfully. \"Don\u0027t often meet a nut as tough as that one. Did you get what you wanted, Sir?\" \n Bond shrugged his shoulders. \"Tell the truth, Sergeant, I didn\u0027t know exactly what I did want. But I was glad to get a good look at Mr Rufus B. Saye. Quite a chap. Doesn\u0027t look much like my idea of a diamond merchant.\" \n Sergeant Dankwaerts chuckled. \"He\u0027s not a diamond merchant, Sir,\" he said, \"or I\u0027ll eat my hat.\" \n \"How do you know?\" \n \"When I read out that list of missing stones,\" Sergeant Dankwaerts smiled happily, \"I mentioned a Yellow Premier and two Cape unions.\" \n \"Yes?\" \n \"It just happens that there aren\u0027t such things, Sir.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1553/46058.html","bookId":1284,"book":{"id":1284,"title":"007之金刚钻 Diamonds Are Forever","description":"简介： 在生产钻石的南非，最近怪事连连，一大批为经切割的钻石失踪了，而且谋杀案频发。这些异常现象引起了英国当局的高度重视，于是007（肖恩?康纳利 Sean Connery 饰）来到了南非。007以钻石批发商的名义展开了一系列的调查，发现一切原来都是他的死对头魔鬼党的首领艾纳斯...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/09/14-06-48-15-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1553","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM"}}
