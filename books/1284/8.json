{"id":30012,"no":8,"title":"8 THE EYE THAT NEVER SLEEPS","content":"IT was 12.30 when Bond went down in the elevator and out on to the roasting street. \n He turned right and walked slowly down towards Times Square. As he passed the handsome black marble frontage of the House of Diamonds, he stopped to examine the two discreet show-windows lined with dark blue velvet. In the centre of each there was just one piece of jewellery, an ear-ring consisting of a big pear-shaped diamond hanging from another perfect stone, circular and brilliant-cut. Below each ear-ring there was a thin plate of yellow gold, in the shape of a visiting card with one edge turned down. On each plate was engraved the words Diamonds are Forever. \n Bond smiled to himself. He wondered which of his predecessors had smuggled those four diamonds into America. \n Bond sauntered on in search of an air-conditioned bar where he could get out of the heat and do some thinking. He was pleased with his interview. At least it hadn\u0027t been the brush-off he had more than half expected. He was amused by the hunchback. There was something splendidly theatrical about him, and his vanity about the Spangled Mob was appealing. But he wasn\u0027t at all funny. \n Bond had walked for only a few minutes when it suddenly occurred to him that he was being followed. There was no evidence for it except a slight tingling of the scalp and an extra awareness of the people near him, but he had faith in his sixth sense and he at once stopped in front of the shop window he was passing and looked casually back along 46th Street. Nothing but a lot of miscellaneous people moving slowly on the sidewalks, mostly on the same side as himself, the side that was sheltered from the sun. There was no sudden movement into a doorway, nobody casually wiping his face with a handkerchief to avoid recognition, nobody bending down to tie a shoelace. \n Bond examined the Swiss watches in his shop window and then turned and sauntered on. After a few yards he stopped again. Still nothing. He went on and turned right into the Avenue of the Americas, stopping in the first doorway, the entrance to a women\u0027s underwear store where a man in a tan suit with his back to him was examining the black lace pants on a particularly realistic dummy. Bond turned and leant against a pillar and gazed lazily but watchfully out into the street. \n And then something gripped his pistol arm and a voice snarled: \"All right, Limey. Take it easy unless you want lead for lunch,\" and he felt something press into his back just above the kidneys. \n What was there familiar about that voice? The Law? The Gang? Bond glanced down to see what was holding his right arm. It was a steel hook. Well, if the man had only one arm! Like lightning he swivelled, bending sideways and bringing his left fist round in a flailing blow, low down. \n There was a smack as his fist was caught in the other man\u0027s left hand, and, at the same time as the contact telegraphed to Bond\u0027s mind that there could have been no gun, there came the well-remembered laugh and the lazy voice saying: \"No good, James. The angels have got you.\" \n Bond straightened himself slowly and for a moment he could only gaze into the grinning hawk-like face of Felix Leiter with blank disbelief, his built-up tension slowly relaxing. \n \"So you were doing a front tail, you lousy bastard,\" he finally said. He looked with delight at the friend he had last seen as a cocoon of dirty bandages on a bloodstained bed in a Florida hotel, the American secret agent with whom he had shared so many adventures. \"What the hell are you doing here? And what the hell do you mean playing the bloody fool in this heat?\" Bond took out a handkerchief and wiped it over his face. \"For a moment you almost made me nervous.\" \n \"Nervous!\" Felix Leiter laughed scornfully. \"You were saying your prayers. And your conscience is so bad you didn\u0027t even know if you were going to get it from the cops or the gang. Right?\" \n Bond laughed and dodged the question. \"Come on, you crooked spy,\" he said. \"You can buy me a drink and tell me all about it. I just don\u0027t believe in odds as long as this. In fact, you can buy me lunch. You Texans are lousy with money.\" \n \"Sure,\" said Leiter. He slipped his steel hook into the right-hand pocket of his coat and took Bond\u0027s arm with his left hand. They moved out on to the street and Bond noticed that Leiter walked with a heavy limp. \"In Texas even the fleas are so rich they can hire themselves dogs. Let\u0027s go. Sardi\u0027s is just over the way.\" \n Leiter avoided the fashionable room at the famous actors\u0027 and writers\u0027 eating house and led Bond upstairs. His limp was more noticeable and he held on to the banisters. Bond made no comment, but when he left his friend at a corner table in the blessedly air-conditioned restaurant and went off to the wash-room to clean himself up, he added up his impressions. The right arm had gone, and the left leg, and there were imperceptible scars below the hairline above the right eye that suggested a good deal of grafting, but otherwise Leiter looked in good shape. The grey eyes were undefeated, the shock of straw-coloured hair had no hint of grey in it, and there was none of the bitterness of a cripple in Leiter\u0027s face. But in their short walk there had been a hint of reticence in Leiter\u0027s manner and Bond felt this had something to do with him, Bond, and perhaps with Leiter\u0027s present activities. Certainly not, he thought as he walked across the room to join his friend, with Leiter\u0027s injuries. \n There was a medium dry Martini with a piece of lemon peel waiting for him. Bond smiled at Leiter\u0027s memory and tasted it. It was excellent, but he didn\u0027t recognize the Vermouth. \n \"Made with Cresta Blanca,\" explained Leitef. \"New domestic brand from California. Like it?\" \n \"Best Vermouth I ever tasted.\" \n \"And I\u0027ve taken a chance and ordered you smoked salmon and Brizzola,\" said Leiter. \"They\u0027ve got some of the finest meat in America here, and Brizzola\u0027s the best cut of that. Beef, straight-cut across the bone. Roast and then broiled. Suit you?\" \n \"Anything you say,\" said Bond. \"We\u0027ve eaten enough meals together to know each other\u0027s tastes.\" \n \"I\u0027ve told them not to hurry,\" said Leiter. He rapped on the table with his hook. \"We\u0027ll have another Martini first and while you drink it you\u0027d better come clean.\" There was warmth in his smile, but his eyes were watching Bond. \"Just tell me one thing. What business have you got with my old friend Shady Tree?\" He gave his order to the waiter and sat forward in his chair and waited. \n Bond finished his first Martini and lit a cigarette. He swivelled casually in his chair. The tables near them were empty. He turned back and faced the American. \n \"You tell me something first, Felix,\" he said softly. \"Who are you working for these days? Still the CIA?\" \n \"Nix,\" said Leiter. \"With my gun hand gone they could only offer me desk work. Very nice about it and paid me off handsomely when I said I wanted an open-air life. So Pinkerton\u0027s made me a good offer. You know, \u0027The Eye that Never Sleeps\u0027 people. So now I\u0027m just a\u0027door-basher\u0027-private detective. Tut on some clothes and open up\u0027 routine. But it\u0027s good fun. They\u0027re a nice crowd to work with, and one day I\u0027ll be able to retire with a pension and a presentation gold watch that goes green in summer. As a matter of fact I\u0027m in charge of their Race Gang squad-doping, crooked running, night-guards at the stables, all that sort of thing. Good job, and it takes you all over the country.\" \n \"Sounds all right,\" said Bond. \"But I didn\u0027t know you knew anything about horses.\" \n \"Usen\u0027t to be able to recognize a horse unless there was a milk-wagon tied on behind,\" admitted Leiter. \"But you soon pick it up, and it\u0027s mostly the people you have to know about, not the horses. What about you?\" He lowered his voice. \"Still with the Old Firm?\" \n \"That\u0027s right,\" said Bond. \n \"On a job for them now?\" \n \"Yes.\" \n \"Undercover?\" \n \"Yes.\" \n Leiter sighed. He sipped his Martini reflectively. \"Well,\" he said finally. \"You\u0027re a dam fool to be operating alone if it\u0027s anything to do with the Spangled boys. In fact, you\u0027re such a bad risk I\u0027m crazy even to be having lunch with you. But I\u0027ll tell you why I was gumshoeing around Shady\u0027s neck of the woods this morning and maybe we can help each other. Without involving our outfits, of course. Okay?\" \n \"You know I\u0027d like to work with you, Felix,\" said Bond seriously. \"But I\u0027m still working for the Government while you\u0027re probably in competition with yours. But if it turns out our target\u0027s the same, there\u0027s no sense in getting wires crossed. If we\u0027re chasing the same hare, I\u0027ll be happy to run with you. Now,\" Bond looked quizzically at the Texan. \"Am I right in thinking you\u0027re interested in someone with a blaze face and four white stockings? Called Shy Smile?\" \n \"That\u0027s right,\" said Leiter, not particularly surprised. \"Running at Saratoga on Tuesday. And what might the running of this horse have to do with the security of the British Empire?\" \n \"I\u0027ve been told to back him,\" said Bond. \"One thousand dollars to win. Pay-off for another job.\" Bond lifted up his cigarette and his hand covered his mouth. \"I brought ?100,000 worth of uncut diamonds in by plane this morning for Mr Spang and his friends.\" \n Leiter\u0027s eyes narrowed. He gave a low whistle of surprise. \n \"Boy!\" he said respectfully. \"You\u0027re certainly in a bigger league than me. I\u0027m only interested because Shy Smile is a ringer. The horse that\u0027s due to win on Tuesday won\u0027t be Shy Smile at all. Shy Smile wasn\u0027t even placed the last three times he ran. And anyway they\u0027ve shot him. It\u0027ll be a very fast job called Picka-pepper. Just by chance he\u0027s got a blaze face and four white stockings, too. Big chestnut, and they\u0027ve done a good job with his hooves and various other small points of difference. They\u0027ve been getting this job ready for over a year. Out in the desert in Nevada, where the Spangs have some sort of a ranch. And are they going to clean up! It\u0027s a big race, with $25,000 added. And you can bet they\u0027ll plaster the country with their money just before the off. Can\u0027t fail to be better than Fives. More like Ten or Fifteen to One. They\u0027ll make a packet.\" \n \"But I thought all horses in America had to have their lips tattooed,\" said Bond. \"How have they got round that?\" \n \"Grafted new skin on to Pickapepper\u0027s mouth. Copied Shy Smile\u0027s marks on it. This tattoo gimmick is getting old fashioned. The word in Pinkerton\u0027s is that the Jockey Club are going to change to photos of the night eyes.\" \n \"What are night eyes?\" \n \"They\u0027re those calluses on the inside of a horse\u0027s knees. The English call them \u0027chestnuts\u0027. Seems they\u0027re different on every horse. Like a man\u0027s fingerprints. But it\u0027ll be the same old story. They\u0027ll photo the night eyes on every racehorse in America and then find the gangs have dreamed up a way of altering them with acid. The cops never catch up with the robbers.\" \n \"How do you know all this about Shy Smile?\" \n \"Blackmail,\" said Leiter cheerfully. \"I had a drugging rap all lined up on one of the Spang stable boys. I let him buy his way out of it with the details of this little caper.\" \n \"What are you going to do about it?\" \n \"Remains to be seen. Going up to Saratoga on Sunday.\" Leiter\u0027s face lit up. \"Hell, why don\u0027t you come along with me? Driving up, and I\u0027ll get you in at my dump. The Sagamore. Swanky motel. You\u0027ve got to sleep somewhere. Better not be seen out together much, but we\u0027ll be able to meet up in the evenings. What do you say?\" \n \"Wonderful,\" said Bond. \"Couldn\u0027t be better. And now it\u0027s dam near two o\u0027clock. Let\u0027s have some lunch and I\u0027ll tell you my end of the story.\" \n The smoked salmon was from Nova Scotia and a poor substitute for the product of Scotland, but the Brizzola was all that Leiter had said, so tender that Bond could cut it with a fork. He finished his lunch with half an avocado with French dressing and then dawdled over his Espresso. \n \"And that\u0027s the long and short of it.\" Bond concluded the story he had been telling between mouthfuls. \"And my guess is that the Spangs are doing the smuggling and the House of Diamonds, which they own, is doing the merchandising. Any views?\" \n Leiter tapped a Lucky Strike out on to the table with his left hand and lit it at the flame of Bond\u0027s Ronson. \n \"Sounds possible,\" he agreed after a pause. \"But I don\u0027t know much about this brother of Seraffimo, Jack Spang. And if Jack Spang is \u0027Saye\u0027 it\u0027s the first I\u0027ve heard of him for a long while. We\u0027ve got records on all the rest of the mob, and I\u0027ve come across Tiffany Case. Nice kid, but she\u0027s been on the fringe of the gangs for years. Didn\u0027t have much chance from the cradle up. Her mother ran the snazziest cat-house in San Francisco. Doing fine until she made one hell of a mistake. Decided one day not to pay the local outfit\u0027s protection money. She was paying the police so much I guess she reckoned they\u0027d look after her. Crazy. One night the mob turned up in force and wrecked the joint. Left the girls alone, but had themselves a gang-bang with Tiffany. She was only sixteen at the time. Not surprising she won\u0027t have anything to do with men since then. Next day she got hold of her mother\u0027s cash box, busted it open, and took to the hills. Then the usual round-hat-check girl, taxi-dancer, studio extra, waitress-until she was about twenty. Then maybe life didn\u0027t seem so good and she took to liquor. Settled in a rooming house down on one of the Florida Keys and started drinking herself to death. Got so she was known as The Boiled Sweet down there. Then a kid fell in the sea and she jumped in and saved him. Got her name in the papers and some rich woman took a fancy to her and practically kidnapped her. Made her join Alcoholics Anonymous and then took her around the world as her companion. But \n Tiffany skipped when they got to \u0027Frisco and went and lived with her old Ma who had retired from the girl game by then. But she never would settle down and I guess she found life a bit quiet so she went on the lam again and ended up in Reno. Worked at Harold\u0027s Club for a bit. Came across our friend Seraffimo, and he got all excited because she wouldn\u0027t sleep with him. Offered her some sort of a job at the Tiara at Las Vegas and she\u0027s been there for the last year or two. Doing these trips to Europe in between, I suppose. But she\u0027s a good kid. Just never had a chance after what the gang did to her.\" \n Bond saw again the eyes gazing sullenly at him out of the mirror, and he heard the record playing Fettilles Mortes in the lonely room. \"I like her,\" he said briefly. He felt Felix Leiter\u0027s eyes watching him speculatively. He looked at his watch. \"Well, Felix,\" he said. \"It looks as if we\u0027ve got hold of the same tiger. But by different tails. It\u0027s going to be fun pulling at them both at the same time. Now I\u0027m going to go and get some sleep. Got a room at the Astor. Where shall we meet on Sunday?\" \n \"Better keep away from this part of town,\" said Leiter. \"Meet you outside the Plaza. Early, so we can avoid the traffic on the Parkway. Let\u0027s say nine o\u0027clock. By the cab-stand. You know, where the horse-cabs are. Then if I\u0027m late you can get to recognize a horse. Useful up at Saratoga.\" \n He paid the check and they walked down and out on to the grilling street. Bond hailed a cab. Leiter refused a lift. Instead he took Bond affectionately by the arm. \n \"Just one thing, James,\" he said, and his voice was serious. \"You may not think the hell of a lot of American gangsters. Compared with SMERSH for instance, and some of the other folk you\u0027ve been up against. But I can tell you these Spangled boys are the tops. They\u0027ve got a good machine, even if they do care to have funny names. And they\u0027ve got protection. That\u0027s how it is in America these days. But don\u0027t misunderstand me. They really stink. And this job of yours stinks too.\" Leiter let go of Bond\u0027s arm and watched him climb into the taxi. Then he leant in through the window. \n \"And do you know what your job stinks of, you dumb bastard?\" he asked cheerfully. \"Formaldehyde and lilies.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1553/46062.html","bookId":1284,"book":{"id":1284,"title":"007之金刚钻 Diamonds Are Forever","description":"简介： 在生产钻石的南非，最近怪事连连，一大批为经切割的钻石失踪了，而且谋杀案频发。这些异常现象引起了英国当局的高度重视，于是007（肖恩?康纳利 Sean Connery 饰）来到了南非。007以钻石批发商的名义展开了一系列的调查，发现一切原来都是他的死对头魔鬼党的首领艾纳斯...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/09/14-06-48-15-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1553","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM"}}
