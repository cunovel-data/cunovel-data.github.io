{"id":30006,"no":2,"title":"2 GEM QUALITY","content":"\"Don\u0027t push it in. Screw it in,\" said M impatiently. \n James Bond, making a mental note to pass M\u0027s dictum on to the Chief of Staff, again picked up the jeweller\u0027s glass from the desk where it had fallen and this time managed to fix it securely into the socket of his right eye. \n Although it was late July and the room was bright with sunshine, M had switched on his desk light and tilted it so that it shone straight at Bond. Bond picked the brilliant-cut stone up and held it to the light. As he turned it between his fingers, all the colours of the rainbow flashed back at him from its mesh of facets until his eye was tired with the dazzle. \n He took out the jeweller\u0027s glass and tried to think of something appropriate to say. \n M looked at him quizzically. \"Fine stone?\" \n \"Wonderful,\" said Bond. \"It must be worth a lot of money.\" \n \"A few pounds for the cutting,\" said M dryly. \"It\u0027s a bit of quartz. Now then, let\u0027s try again.\" He consulted a list on the desk in front of him and selected a fold of tissue paper, verified the number written on it, unfolded it and pushed it across to Bond. \n Bond put the piece of quartz back into its own wrapping and picked up the second sample. \n \"It\u0027s easy for you, Sir,\" he smiled at M. \"You\u0027ve got the crib.\" He screwed the glass back into his eye and held the stone, if it was a stone, up to the light. \n This time, he thought, there could be no doubt about it. This stone also had the thirty-two facets above and the twenty-four below of the brilliant-cut, and it was also about twenty carats, but what he now held had a heart of blue-white flame, and the infinite colours reflected and refracted from its depths lanced into his eye like needles. With his left hand he picked up the quartz dummy and held it beside the diamond in front of his glass. It was a lifeless chunk of matter, almost opaque beside the dazzling translucence of the diamond, and the rainbow colours he had seen a few minutes before were now coarse and muddy. \n Bond put down the piece of quartz and gazed again into the heart of the diamond. Now he could understand the passion that diamonds had inspired through the centuries, the almost sexual love they aroused among those who handled them and cut them and traded in them. It was domination by a beauty so pure that it held a kind of truth, a divine authority before which all other material things turned, like the bit of quartz, to clay. In these few minutes Bond understood the myth of diamonds, and he knew that he would never forget what he had suddenly seen inside the heart of this stone.. \n He put the diamond down on its slip of paper and dropped the jeweller\u0027s glass into the palm of his hand. He looked across into M\u0027s watchful eyes. \"Yes,\" he said. \"I see.\" \n M sat back in his chair. \"That\u0027s what Jacoby meant when I had lunch with him the other day at the Diamond Corporation,\" he said. \"He said that if I was going to get involved in the diamond business I ought to try and understand what was really at the bottom of it all. Not just the millions of money involved, or the value of diamonds as a hedge against inflation, or the sentimental fashions in diamonds for engagement rings and so forth. He said one must understand the passion for diamonds. So he just showed me what I\u0027m showing you. And,\" M smiled thinly at Bond, \"if it will give you any satisfaction, I was just as taken in by that bit of quartz as you were.\" \n Bond sat still and said nothing. \n \"And now let\u0027s run through the rest,\" said M. He gestured towards the pile of paper packets in front of him. \"I said I\u0027d like to borrow some samples. They didn\u0027t seem to mind. Sent this lot round to my house this morning.\" M consulted his list, opened a packet and pushed it across to Bond. \"What you were looking at just now was the best-a \u0027Fine Blue-white\u0027.\" He gestured towards the big diamond in front of Bond. \"Now this is a \u0027Top Crystal\u0027, ten carats, baguette-cut. Very fine stone, but worth about half a \u0027Blue-white\u0027. You\u0027ll see there\u0027s the faintest trace of yellow in it. The \u0027Cape\u0027 I\u0027m going to show you next has a slight brownish tinge, according to Jacoby, but I\u0027m damned if I can see it. I doubt if anyone can except the experts.\" \n Bond obediently picked up the Top Crystal\u0027 and for the next quarter, of an hour M led him through the whole range of diamonds down to a wonderful series of coloured stones, ruby red, blue, pink, yellow, green and violet. Finally, M pushed over a packet of smaller stones, all flawed or marked or of poor colour. \"Industrial diamonds. Not what they call \u0027gem quality\u0027. Used in machine tools and so forth. But don\u0027t despise them. America bought ?5,000,000 worth of them last year, and that\u0027s only one of the markets. Bronsteen told me it was stones like these that were used for cutting the St Gothard tunnel. At the other end of the scale, dentists use them for drilling your teeth. They\u0027re the hardest substance in the world. Last forever.\" \n M pulled out his pipe and started to fill it. \"And now you know as much about diamonds as I do.\" \n Bond sat back in his chair and gazed vaguely at the bits of tissue paper and glittering stones that lay scattered across the red leather surface of M\u0027s desk. He wondered what it was all about. \n There was the rasp of a match against a box and Bond watched M tamp the burning tobacco down in the bowl of his pipe and then put the matchbox back in his pocket and tilt his chair in M\u0027s favourite attitude for reflection. \n Bond glanced down at his watch. It was 11.30. Bond thought with pleasure of the in-tray piled with Top Secret dockets he had gladly abandoned when the red telephone had summoned him an hour before. He felt fairly confident that now he wouldn\u0027t have to deal with them. \"I guess it\u0027s a job,\" the Chief of Staff had said in answer to Bond\u0027s inquiry. \"The Chief says he won\u0027t take any more calls before lunch and he\u0027s made an appointment for you at the Yard for two o\u0027clock. Step on it.\" And Bond had reached for his coat and had gone into the outer office where he was pleased to see his secretary registering in another bulky file with a Most Immediate tab. \n \"M,\" said Bond as she looked up. \"And Bill says it looks like a job. So don\u0027t think you\u0027re going to have the pleasure of shovelling that lot into my in-tray. You can post it off to the Daily Express for all I care.\" He grinned at her. \"Isn\u0027t that chap Sefton Delmer a boy friend of yours, Lil? Just the stuff for him, I expect.\" \n She looked at him appraisingly. \"Your tie\u0027s crooked,\" she said coldly. \"And anyway I hardly know him.\" She bent over her registry and Bond went out and along the corridor and thought how lucky he was to have a beautiful secretary. \n There was a creak from M\u0027s chair and Bond looked across the table at the man who held a great deal of his affection and all his loyalty and obedience. \n The grey eyes looked back at him thoughtfully. M took the pipe out of his mouth. \"How long have you been back from that holiday in France?\" \n \"Two weeks, Sir.\" \n \"Have a good time?\" \n \"Not bad, Sir. Got a bit bored towards the end.\" \n M made no comment. \"I\u0027ve been looking at your record sheet. Small-arms marks seem to be keeping well up in the top bracket. Unarmed combat\u0027s satisfactory and your last medical shows you\u0027re in pretty good shape.\" M paused. \"The point is,\" he went on unemotionally, \"I\u0027ve got rather a tough assignment for you. Wanted to make sure you\u0027d be able to take care of yourself.\" \n \"Of course, Sir.\" Bond was slightly nettled. \n \"Don\u0027t make any mistake about this job, 007,\" said M sharply. \"When I say it may be tough, I\u0027m not being melodramatic. There are plenty of tricky people you haven\u0027t met yet, and there may be some of them mixed up in this business. And some of the most efficient. So don\u0027t be tetchy when I think twice before getting you involved in it.\" \n \"Sorry, Sir.\" \n \"All right then,\" M put his pipe down and leant forward with his arms crossed on the desk. \"I\u0027ll tell you the story and then you can decide whether you want to take it on.\" \n \"A week ago,\" said M, \"one of the high-ups in the Treasury came to see me. Brought with him the Permanent Secretary to the Board of Trade. It had to do with diamonds. Seems that most of what they call \u0027gem\u0027 diamonds in the world are mined on British territory and that ninety per cent of all diamond sales are carried out in London. By the Diamond Corporation.\" M shrugged his shoulders. \"Don\u0027t ask me why. The British got hold of the business at the beginning of the century and we\u0027ve managed to hang on to it. Now it\u0027s a huge trade. Fifty million pounds a year. The biggest dollar-earner we\u0027ve got. So when something goes wrong with it, the Government gets worried. And that\u0027s what\u0027s happened.\" M looked mildly across at Bond. \"At least two million pounds worth of diamonds are being smuggled out of Africa every year.\" \n \"That\u0027s a lot of money,\" said Bond. \"Where are they going to?\" \n \"They say America,\" said M. \"And I agree with them. It\u0027s by far the biggest diamond market. And those gangs of theirs are the only people who could run an operation on this scale.\" \n \"Why don\u0027t the mining companies stop it?\" \n \"They\u0027ve done everything they can,\" said M. \"You probably saw in the papers that De Beers took on our friend Sillitoe when he left MI5, and he\u0027s out there now, working in with the South African security people. I gather he\u0027s put in a pretty drastic report and come up with plenty of bright ideas for tightening things up, but the Treasury and the Board of Trade aren\u0027t very impressed. They think the thing\u0027s too big to be handled by a lot of separate mining companies, however efficient they are. And they\u0027ve got one very good reason for wanting to take official action on their own.\" \n \"What\u0027s that, Sir?\" \n \"There\u0027s a big packet of smuggled stones in London at this very moment,\" said M, and his eyes glittered across the desk at Bond. \"Waiting to go to America. And the Special Branch know who the carrier is to be. And they know who\u0027s to go out with him to keep an eye on him. As soon as Ronnie Vallance came across the story-it was leaked to one of his narks in Soho, to one of his \u0027Ghost Squad\u0027 as he chooses to call it-he went straight off to the Treasury. The Treasury talked to the Board of Trade and then both their Ministers formed up to the PM. And the PM gave them authority to use the Service.\" \n \"Why not let the Special Branch of MI5 handle it, Sir?\" asked Bond, reflecting that M seemed to be going through a bad phase of mixing in other people\u0027s business. \n \"Of course they could arrest the carriers as soon as they took delivery and tried to get out of the country,\" said M impatiently. \"But that won\u0027t stop the traffic. These people aren\u0027t the sort thai talk. Anyway the carriers are only small fry. They probably just get the stuff from a man in a park and hand it over to another man in a park when they get to the other side. The only way to get to the bottom of the business is to follow the pipeline to America and see where it goes to there. And the FBI won\u0027t be much help to us, I\u0027m afraid. It\u0027s a very small part of their battle with the big-time gangs. And it\u0027s not doing any harm to the United States. Rather the reverse if anything. It\u0027s only England that\u0027s the loser. And America is outside the jurisdiction of the police and MI5. Only the Service can handle the job.\" \n \"Yes, I see that,\" said Bond. \"But have we got anything else to go on?\" \n \"Ever heard of \u0027The House of Diamonds\u0027?\" \n \"Yes, of course, Sir,\" said Bond. \"The big American jewellers. On West 46th Street in New York and the Rue de Rivoli in Paris. I gather they rank almost as high as Cartier and Van Cleef and Boucheron nowadays. They\u0027ve come up very quickly since the war.\" \n \"Yes,\" said M. \"Those are the people. They\u0027ve got a small place in London, too. Hatton Garden. Used to be very big buyers at the monthly showings of the Diamond Corporation. But for the last three years they\u0027ve bought less and less. Although, as you say, they seem to be selling more and more jewellery every year. Must be getting their diamonds from somewhere. It was the Treasury who brought their name up at our meeting the other day. But I can\u0027t find out anything against them. They\u0027ve got one of their biggest men in charge over here. Seems odd as they do so little business. Man called Rufus B. Saye. Nothing much known about him. Lunches every day at the American Club in Piccadilly. Plays golf at Sunningdale. Doesn\u0027t drink or smoke. Lives at the Savoy. Model citizen.\" M shrugged his shoulders. \"But the diamond business is a nice, well-regulated sort of family affair, and there\u0027s an impression that the House of Diamonds has an awkward look about it. Nothing more than that.\" \n Bond decided it was time to put the sixty-four thousand dollar question. \"And where do I come in, Sir?\" he asked, looking across the desk into M\u0027s eyes. \n \"You\u0027ve got an appointment with Vallance at the Yard in\"-M looked at his watch-\"just over an hour. He\u0027s going to start you off. They\u0027re going to pull in this carrier tonight and put you into the pipeline instead of him.\" \n Bond\u0027s fingers curled softly round the arms of his chair. \n \"And then?\" \n \"And then,\" said M matter-of-factly, \"you\u0027re going to smuggle those diamonds into America, At least that\u0027s the idea. What do you think of it?\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1553/46056.html","bookId":1284,"book":{"id":1284,"title":"007之金刚钻 Diamonds Are Forever","description":"简介： 在生产钻石的南非，最近怪事连连，一大批为经切割的钻石失踪了，而且谋杀案频发。这些异常现象引起了英国当局的高度重视，于是007（肖恩?康纳利 Sean Connery 饰）来到了南非。007以钻石批发商的名义展开了一系列的调查，发现一切原来都是他的死对头魔鬼党的首领艾纳斯...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/09/14-06-48-15-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1553","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM"}}
