{"id":30020,"no":16,"title":"16 THE TIARA","content":"BOND had lunch in the air-conditioned \u0027Sunburst Room\u0027 beside the big kidney-shaped swimming pool (LIFESAVER: BOBBY BILBO-POOL SCOURED DAILY BY HYDRO JET, said a sign) and having decided that only about one per cent of the customers were fit to wear bathing suits, walked very slowly through the heat across the twenty yards of baked lawn that separated his building from the central establishment, took off his clothes and threw himself naked on his bed. \\n\\n There were six buildings containing the bedrooms of The Tiara and they were named after jewels. Bond was on the ground floor of \u0027The Turquoise\u0027. Its motif was egg-shell blue with furnishing materials of dark blue and white. His room was extremely comfortable and equipped with expensive and well-designed modern furniture of a silvery wood that might have been birch. There was a radio beside his bed and a television set with a seventeen-inch screen beside the broad window. Outside the window there was a small enclosed breakfast patio. It was very quiet and there was no sound from the thermostat-controlled air-conditioning and Bond was almost instantly asleep. \\n\\n He slept for four hours, and during this time the wire-recorder, concealed in the base of the bedside table, wasted several hundred feet of wire on dead silence. \\n\\n When he awoke it was seven. The wire-recorder noted that he picked up the telephone and asked for Miss Tiffany Case and after a pause said, \"Would you please tell her that Mr James Bond called\" and put back the receiver. It then picked up the noise of Bond moving about the room, the hiss of the shower and, at 7.30, the click of his key in the lock as he went out and shut the door. \\n\\n Half an hour later the recorder heard a knock on his door and then, after a pause, the noise of the door opening. A man dressed like a waiter, with a basket of fruit bearing a note saying, \u0027With the Compliments of the Management\u0027, came into the room and walked quickly over to the bedside table. He undid two screws, removed the reel o? fine wire on the recorder\u0027s turntable, replaced it with a fresh reel, put the basket of fruit on the dressing table and went out and closed the door. \\n\\n And then for several hours the recorder whirred silently on, recording nothing. \\n\\n Bond sat at the long bar of the Tiara and sipped a Vodka Martini and examined the great gambling room with a professional eye. \\n\\n The first thing he noticed was that Las Vegas seemed to have invented a new school of functional architecture, \u0027The Gilded \\n\\n Mousetrap School\u0027 he thought it might be called, whose main \\n\\n purpose was to channel the customer-mouse into the central gambling trap whether he wanted the cheese or not. \\n\\n There were only two entrances, one from the street outside, and one from the bedroom buildings and the swimming pool. Once you had come in through either of these, whether you wanted to buy a paper or cigarettes at the news stand, have a drink or a meal in one of the two restaurants, get your hair cut or have a. massage in the \u0027Health Club\u0027, or just visit the lavatories, there was no way of reaching your objective without passing between the banks of slot machines and gambling tables. And when you were trapped in the vortex of the whirring machines, amongst which there sounded always, from somewhere, the intoxicating silvery cascade of coins into a metal cup, or occasionally the golden cry of \"Jackpot!\" from one of the change-girls, you were lost. Beseiged by the excited back-chat from the three big crap tables, the seductive whirl of the two roulette wheels, and the clank of silver dollars across the green pools of the blackjack tables, it would be a mouse of steel who could get through without a tentative nibble at this delicious chunk of lucky cheese. \\n\\n But, reflected Bond, it could only be a trap for peculiarly insensitive mice-mice who would be tempted by the coarsest cheese. It was an inelegant trap, obvious and vulgar, and the noise of the machines had a horrible mechanical ugliness which beat at the brain. It was like the steady clanking of the engines of some old iron freighter on its way to the knacker\u0027s yard, un-oiled, uncared for, condemned. \\n\\n And the gamblers stood and tore at the handles of the machines as if they hated what they were doing. And, once they had seen their fate in the small glass window, they didn\u0027t wait for the wheels to stop spinning but rammed in another coin and reached up a right arm that knew exactly where to go. Crank-clatter-ting. Crank-clatter-ting. \\n\\n And, when there was the occasional silvery waterfall, the metal cup would overflow with coins and the gambler would have to go down on her knees to scrabble about under the machines for a rolling coin. For, as Leiter had said, they were mostly women, elderly women of the prosperous housewife class, and the droves of them stood at the banks of machines like hens in an egg battery, conditioned by the delicious coolness of the room and the music of the spinning wheels, to go on laying it on the line until their wad was gone. \\n\\n Then, as Bond watched, a change-girl\u0027s voice bawled \"Jackpot!\" and some of the women raised their heads and the picture changed. Now they reminded Bond of Dr Pavlov\u0027s dogs, the saliva drooling down from their jaws at the treacherous bell that brought no dinner, and he shuddered at the thought of the empty eyes of these women and their skins and their wet half-open mouths and their bruised hands. \\n\\n Bond turned his back on the scene and sipped at his Martini, listening with half his mind to the music from the famous-name-band at the end of the room next to the half-dozen shops. Over one of the shops there was a pale blue neon sign which said \u0027The House of Diamonds\u0027. Bond beckoned to the barman. \"Mr Spang been around tonight?\" \\n\\n \"Ain\u0027t seen him,\" said the barman. \"Mostly comes in after the first show. Around eleven. You know him?\" \\n\\n \"Not personally.\" \\n\\n Bond paid his check and drifted over to the blackjack tables. He stopped at the centre one. This one would be his. At exactly five minutes past ten. He glanced at his watch. Eight-thirty. \\n\\n The table was a small, flat kidney of green baize. Eight players sat on high stools facing the dealer, who stood with his stomach against the edge of the table and dealt two cards into the eight numbered spaces on the cloth in front of the stakes. The stakes were mostly five or- ten silver dollars, or counters worth twenty. The dealer was a man of about forty. He had a pleasant half-smile on his face. He wore the dealer\u0027s uniform-white shirt buttoned at the wrists, a thin black Western gambler\u0027s tie, a green eyeshade, black trousers. The front of the trousers was protected from rubbing against the table by a small green baize apron. \u0027Jake\u0027 was embroidered in one corner. \\n\\n The dealer dealt and handled the stakes with unruffled smoothness. There was no talk at the table except when a player ordered a \u0027courtesy\u0027 drink or cigarettes from one of the waitresses in black silk pyjamas who circulated in the central space inside the ring of tables. From this central space, the run of the play was watched over by two tough lynx-eyed pit-bosses with guns at their waists. \\n\\n The game was quick and efficient and dull. It was as dull and mechanical as the slot machines. Bond watched for a while and then moved away towards the doors marked \u0027Smoking Room\" and \u0027Powder Room\u0027 on the far side of the Casino. On his way he passed four \u0027Sheriffs\u0027 in smart grey Western uniform. The legs of their trousers were tucked into half-Wellingtons. These men were standing about unobtrusively, looking at nothing but seeing everything. At each hip they carried a gun in an open holster and the polished brass of fifty cartridges shone at their belts. \\n\\n Plenty of protection around, thought Bond, as he pushed his way through the swing door of the \u0027Smoking Room\u0027. Inside, on the tiled wall, was a notice which said, \u0027Stand up Closer. It\u0027s Shorter than you Think\u0027. Western humour! Bond wondered if he dared include it in his next written report to M. He decided it would not appeal. He went out and walked back through the tables to the door beneath a neon sign which said \u0027The Opal Room\u0027. \\n\\n The low circular restaurant in pink and white and grey was half full. The \u0027Hostess\u0027 swept over and piloted him to a corner table. She bent over to arrange the flowers in the middle of the table and to show him that her fine bosom was at least half real, gave him a gracious smile and went away. After ten minutes, a waitress with a tray appeared and put a roll on his plate and a square of butter. She also set down a dish containing olives and some celery lined with orange cheese. Then a second and older waitress bustled over and gave him the menu and said \"Be right with you\". \\n\\n Twenty minutes after he had sat down, Bond was able to order a dozen cherrystone clams and a steak, and, since he expected a further long pause, a second Vodka dry Martini. \"The wine waiter will be right over,\" said the waitress primly and disappeared in the direction of the kitchen. \\n\\n \u0027Long on courtesy and short on service\u0027, reflected Bond, and resigned himself to the gracious ritual. \\n\\n \"During the excellent dinner that finally materialized, Bond wondered about the evening ahead and about how he could force the pace of his assignment. He was thoroughly bored with his role as a probationary crook who was about to be paid off for his first trial job and might then, if he found favour in the eyes of Mr Spang, be given regular work with the rest-of the teenage adults who made up the gang. It irked him not to have the initiative-to be ordered to Saratoga and then to this hideous sucker-trap at the say-so of a handful of big-time hoodlums. Here he was, eating their dinner and sleeping in their bed, while they watched him, James Bond, and weighed him up and debated whether his hand was steady enough, his appearance trustworthy enough and his health adequate to some sleazy job in one of their rackets. \\n\\n Bond munched his steak as if it was Mr Seraffimo Spang\u0027s fingers and cursed the day he had taken on this idiotic role. But then he paused and went on eating more calmly. What the hell was he worrying about? This was a big assignment which so far had gone well. And now he had penetrated right to the end of the pipeline, right into the parlour of Mr Seraffimo Spang who, with his brother in London, and with the mysterious ABC, ran the biggest smuggling operation in the world. What did Bond\u0027s feelings matter? It was only a moment of self-disgust, a touch of nausea brought on by being a stranger who had spent too many days too close to these sordidly powerful American gangs, too close to the gunpowder-scented \u0027gracious life\u0027 of gangland aristocracy. \\n\\n The truth of the matter, Bond decided over coffee, was that he felt homesick for his real identity. He shrugged his shoulders. To hell with the Spangs and the hood-ridden town of Las Vegas. He looked at his watch. It was just ten o\u0027clock. He lit a cigarette and got to his feet and walked slowly across the room and out into the Casino. \\n\\n There were two ways of playing the rest of the game, by lying low and waiting for something to happen-or by forcing the pace so that something had to happen. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1553/46070.html","bookId":1284,"book":{"id":1284,"title":"007之金刚钻 Diamonds Are Forever","description":"简介： 在生产钻石的南非，最近怪事连连，一大批为经切割的钻石失踪了，而且谋杀案频发。这些异常现象引起了英国当局的高度重视，于是007（肖恩?康纳利 Sean Connery 饰）来到了南非。007以钻石批发商的名义展开了一系列的调查，发现一切原来都是他的死对头魔鬼党的首领艾纳斯...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/09/14-06-48-15-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1553","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM"}}
