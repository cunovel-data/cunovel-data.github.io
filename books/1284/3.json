{"id":30007,"no":3,"title":"3 HOT ICE","content":"JAMES BOND shut the door of M\u0027s office behind him. He smiled into the warm brown eyes of Miss Moneypenny and walked across her office into the Chief of Staff\u0027s room. The Chief of Staff, a lean relaxed man of about Bond\u0027s age, put down his pen and sat back in his chair. He watched as Bond automatically reached for the flat gun-metal cigarette case in his hip pocket and walked over to the open window and looked down on to Regent\u0027s Park. There was a thoughtful deliberation in Bond\u0027s movements that answered the Chief of Staff\u0027s question. \"So you\u0027ve bought it.\" Bond turned round. \"Yes,\" he said. He lit a cigarette. Through the smoke, his eyes looked very directly at the Chief of Staff. \"But just tell me this, Bill. Why\u0027s the old man got cold feet about this job? He\u0027s even looked up the results of my last medical. What\u0027s he so worried about? It\u0027s not as if this was Iron Curtain business. America\u0027s a civilized country. More or less. What\u0027s eating him?\" It was the Chief of Staffs duty to know most of what went on in M\u0027s mind. His own cigarette had gone out and he lit it and threw the spent match over his left shoulder. He looked round to see whether it had fallen in the wastepaper basket. It had. He smiled up at Bond. \"Constant practice,\" he said. Then : \"There aren\u0027t many things that worry M, James, and you know that as well as anybody in the Service. SMERSH, of course. The German cypher-breakers. The Chinese opium ring-or at any rate the power they have all over the world. The authority of the Mafia. And, and he\u0027s got a damned healthy respect for them, the American gangs. The big ones. That\u0027s all. Those are the only people that get him worried. And this diamond business looks as if it\u0027s pretty certain to bring you up against the gangs. They\u0027re the last people he expected us to get mixed up with. He\u0027s got quite enough on his plate without them. That\u0027s all. That\u0027s what\u0027s giving him cold feet about this job.\" \"There\u0027s nothing so extraordinary about American gangsters,\" protested Bond. \"They\u0027re not Americans. Mostly a lot of Italian bums with monogrammed shirts who spend the day eating spaghetti and meatballs and squirting scent over themselves.\" \"That\u0027s what you think,\" said the Chief of Staff. \"But the point is that those are only the ones you see. There are better ones behind them, and still better ones behind those. Look at narcotics. Ten million addicts. Where do they get the stuff from? Look at gambling-legitimate gambling. Two hundred and fifty million dollars a year is the take at Las Vegas. Then there are the undercover games at Miami and Chicago and so on. All owned by the gangs and their friends. A few years ago, Buggsy Siegel got the back of his head blown off because he wanted too much of the take from the Las Vegas operation. And he was tough enough. These are big operations. Do you realize gambling\u0027s the biggest single industry in America? Bigger than steel. Bigger than motor cars? And they take damned good care to keep it running smoothly. Get hold of a copy of the Kefauver Report if you don\u0027t believe me. And now these diamonds. Six million dollars a year is good money, and you can bet your life it\u0027ll be well protected.\" The Chief of Staff paused. He looked impatiently up at the tall figure in the dark blue single-breasted suit and into the obstinate eyes in the lean, brown face. \"Perhaps you haven\u0027t read the FBI Report on American Crime for this year. Interesting. Just thirty-four murders every day. Nearly 150,000 Americans criminally killed in the last twenty years.\" Bond looked incredulous. \"It\u0027s a fact, damn you. Get hold of these Reports and see for yourself. And that\u0027s why M wanted to make sure you were fit before he put you into the pipeline. You\u0027re going to take those gangs on. And you\u0027ll be by yourself. Satisfied:1\" Bond\u0027s face relaxed. \"Come on, Bill,\" he said. \"If that\u0027s all there is to it, I\u0027ll buy you lunch. It\u0027s my turn and I feel like celebrating. No more paperwork this summer. I\u0027ll take you to Scotts\u0027 and we\u0027ll have some of their dressed crab and a pint of black velvet. You\u0027ve taken a load off my mind. I thought there might be some ghastly snag about this job.\" \"All right, blast you.\" The Chief of Staff put aside the misgivings which he fully shared with his Chief, and followed Bond out of the office and slammed the door with unnecessary force behind him. Later, punctually at two o\u0027clock, Bond was shaking hands with the dapper, level-eyed man in the old-fashioned office which hears more secrets than any other room in Scotland Yard. Bond had made friends with Assistant Commissioner Vallance over the Moonraker affair and there was no need to waste time on preliminaries. Vallance pushed a couple of CID identification photographs across the desk. They showed a dark-haired, rather good-looking young man with a clean-cut, swashbuckling face in which the eyes smiled innocently. \"That\u0027s the chap,\" said Vallance. \"Near enough like you to pass with someone who\u0027s only got his description. Peter Franks. Nice-looking fellow. Good family. Public school and all that. Then he went wrong and stayed wrong. Country house burglaries are his line. May have been on the Duke of Windsor job at Sunningdale a few years ago. We\u0027ve pulled him in once or twice, but we could never get anything to stick. Now he\u0027s slipped up. They often do when they get into a racket they know nothing about. I\u0027ve got two or three undercover girls in Soho and he\u0027s keen on one of them. Funnily enough, she\u0027s rather keen on him. Thinks she can make him go straight and all that sort of stuff. But she\u0027s got her job to do, and when he told her about this job, just casually, as if it was the hell of a lark, she passed the word back here.\" Bond nodded. \"Specialist crooks never take other people\u0027s lines seriously. I bet he wouldn\u0027t have talked to her about one of his country house jobs.\" \"Not on your life,\" agreed Vallance. \"Or we\u0027d have had him inside years ago. Anyway, it seems he was contacted by a friend of a friend and agreed to do a smuggling job to America for $5000. Payable on delivery. My girl asked him if it was drugs. And he laughed and said \u0027no-better still, Hot Ice\u0027. Had he got the diamonds? No. His next job was to contact his \u0027guard\u0027. Tomorrow evening at the Trafalgar Palace. Five o\u0027clock in her room. A girl called Case. She would tell him what to do and go over with him.\" Vallance got up and paced to and fro in front of the framed forgeries of five pound notes that lined the wall opposite the windows. \"These smugglers generally go in pairs when big stuff is being moved. The carrier is never quite trusted, and the men at the other end like to have a witness in case anything goes wrong at the customs. Then the big men don\u0027t get caught napping if the carrier talks.\" Big stuff being moved. Carriers. Customs. Guards. Bond killed his cigarette in the ash-tray on Vallance\u0027s desk. How often, in his early days in his own Service, had he been part of this same routine-through Strasbourg into Germany, through Niegoreloye into Russia, over the Simplon, across the Pyrenees. The tension. The dry mouth. The nails ground into the palms of the hands. And now, having graduated away from all that, here he was going through with it again. \"Yes, I see,\" said Bond, dodging his memories. \"But what\u0027s the general picture? Got any ideas? What sort of an operation was Franks going to fit in to?\" \"Well, the diamonds certainly come from Africa.\" Vallance\u0027s eyes were opaque. \"Probably not the union mines. More likely the big leak out of Sierra Leone our friend Sillitoe\u0027s been looking for. Then the stones may get out through Liberia, or more likely French Guinea. Then perhaps into France. And since this packet\u0027s turned up in London, presumably London\u0027s part of the pipeline too.\" Vallance stopped his pacing and faced Bond. \"And now we know that this packet is on its way to America, and what happens to it there is anybody\u0027s guess. The operators wouldn\u0027t try and save money on the cutting-that\u0027s where half the price of a diamond goes-so it looks as if the stones get funnelled into some legitimate diamond business and then get cut and marketed like any other stones.\" Vallance paused. \"You won\u0027t mind if I give you a bit of advice?\" \"Don\u0027t be ridiculous.\" \"Well,\" said Vallance, \"in all these jobs the pay-off to subordinates is generally the weakest link. How was this $5000 to be paid to Peter Franks? Who by? And if he did the job successfully, would he be taken on again? If I was in your shoes I\u0027d watch these points. Concentrate on getting through the cutout who does the paying off and try to get on farther up the pipeline towards the big men. If they like the look of you it shouldn\u0027t be difficult. Good carriers aren\u0027t easy to come by, and even the top men are going to be interested in the new recruit.\u0027\" \"Yes,\" said Bond thoughtfully, \"that makes sense. The main trouble will be to get past the first contact in America. Let\u0027s hope the whole job doesn\u0027t blow up in my face in the customs shed at Idlewild. I shall look pretty silly if the Inspectoscope picks me up. But I expect this Case woman will have some bright ideas about actually carrying the stuff. And now what\u0027s the first step? How are you going to substitute me for Peter Franks?\" Vallance started pacing to and fro again. \"I think that ought to be all right,\" he said. \"We\u0027re going to take in Franks this evening and hold him for conspiring to evade the customs.\" He smiled briefly. \"It\u0027ll break up a beautiful friendship with my girl I\u0027m afraid. But that\u0027s got to be faced. And then the idea is for you to make the rendezvous with Miss Case.\" \"Does she know anything about Franks?\" \"Just his description and his name,\" said Vallance. \"At least that\u0027s what we guess. I doubt if she even knows the man who contacted him. Cut-outs all along the line. Everybody does one job in a watertight compartment. Then, if there\u0027s a hole in the sock, it doesn\u0027t run.\" \"Know anything about the woman?\" \"Passport details. American citizen. 27. Born San Francisco. Blonde. Blue eyes. Height 5 ft 6 in. Profession: single woman. Been over here a dozen times in the last three years. May have been more often under a different name. Always stays at the Trafalgar Palace. The hotel detective says she doesn\u0027t seem to go out much. Few visitors. Never stays more than two weeks. Never gives any trouble. That\u0027s all. Don\u0027t forget that when you meet her you\u0027ll have to have a good story yourself. Why you\u0027re doing the job and so on.\" \"I\u0027ll see to that.\" \"Anything else we can help over?\" Bond reflected. The rest seemed to be up to him. Once he had got into the pipe it would just be a question of improvising. Then he remembered the jewellery firm. \"What about this House of Diamonds lead the Treasury dreamed up? Seems a long shot. Any views?\" \"Quite honestly I hadn\u0027t bothered with them.\" There was apology in Vallance\u0027s voice. \"I checked on this man Saye, but again it\u0027s a blank except for his passport details. American. 45. Diamond merchant. And so on. He goes to Paris a lot. Been going once a month for the last three years as a matter of fact. Probably got a girl there. Tell you what. Why not go along and have a look at the place and at him? You never can tell.\" \"How would I set about that?\" asked Bond dubiously. Vallance didn\u0027t answer. Instead he pressed a switch on the big intercom on his desk. \"Yes, Sir?\" said a metallic voice. \"Send up Dankwaerts at the double, please Sergeant. And Lobiniere. And then get me the House of Diamonds on the telephone. Gem merchants in Hatton Garden. Ask for Mr Saye.\" Vallance went and looked out of the window at the river. He took a cigarette lighter out of his waistcoat pocket and flicked at it absent-mindedly. There was a knock on the door and Val-lance\u0027s staff secretary put his head in. \"Sergeant Dankwaerts, Sir.\" \"Send him in,\" said Vallance. \"Hold Lobiniere until I ring.\" The secretary held open the door and a nondescript man in plain-clothes came in. His hair was thinning, he wore spectacles and his complexion was pale. His expression was kindly and studious. He might have been any senior clerk in any business. \"Afternoon, Sergeant,\" said Vallance. \"This is Commander Bond of the Ministry of Defence.\" The Sergeant smiled politely. \"I want you to take Commander Bond to the House of Diamonds in Hatton Garden. He will be \u0027Sergeant fames\u0027 of your staff. You think the diamonds from that Ascot job are on their way out to the Argentine through America. You will say so to Mr Saye, the top man there. You will wonder if it is possible that Mr Saye has heard any talk from the other side. His New York office may have heard something. You know, all very nice and polite. But just look him in the eye. Put as much pressure on as you can without giving any grounds for complaint. Then apologize and leave and forget all about it. All right? Any questions?\" \"No, Sir,\" said Sergeant Dankwaerts stolidly. Vallance spoke into the intercom and a moment later there appeared a sallow, rather ingratiating man wearing extremely smart plain-clothes and carrying a small attache case. He stood waiting just inside the door. \"Good afternoon, Sergeant. Come and have a look at this friend of mine.\" The Sergeant came and stood close up to Bond and politely turned him towards the light. Two very keen dark eyes examined his face minutely for a full minute. Then the man stepped away. \"Can\u0027t guarantee the scar for more than six hours, Sir,\" he said. \"Not in this heat. But the rest\u0027s all right. Who is he to be, Sir?\" \"He\u0027s to be Sergeant James, a member of Sergeant Dank waert\u0027s staff.\" Vallance looked at his watch. \"Only for three hours. All right?\" \"Certainly, Sir. Shall I go ahead?\" At Vallance\u0027s nod, the policeman led Bond to a chair by the window, put his small attache case on the floor beside the chair and knelt down on one knee and opened it. Then, for ten minutes, his light fingers busied themselves over Bond\u0027s face and hair. Bond resigned himself and listened to Vallance talking to the House of Diamonds. \"Not until 3.30? In that case would you please tell Mr Saye that two of my men will be calling on him at 3.30 sharp. Yes, I\u0027m afraid it is rather important. Only a formality of course. Routine inquiry. I don\u0027t expect it will take up more than ten minutes of Mr Saye\u0027s time. Thank you so much. Yes. Assistant Commissioner Vallance. That\u0027s right. Scotland Yard. Yes. Thank you. Goodbye.\" Vallance put back the receiver and turned towards Bond. \"Secretary says Saye won\u0027t be back until 3.30. I suggest you get there at 3.15. Never does any harm to have a look round first. Always useful to get your man a bit off balance. How\u0027s it going?\" Sergeant Lobiniere held up a pocket mirror in front of Bond. A touch of white at the temples. The scar gone. A hint of studiousness at the corners of the eyes and mouth. The faintest shadows under the cheekbones. Nothing you could put your finger on, but it all added up to someone who certainly wasn\u0027t James Bond.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1553/46057.html","bookId":1284,"book":{"id":1284,"title":"007之金刚钻 Diamonds Are Forever","description":"简介： 在生产钻石的南非，最近怪事连连，一大批为经切割的钻石失踪了，而且谋杀案频发。这些异常现象引起了英国当局的高度重视，于是007（肖恩?康纳利 Sean Connery 饰）来到了南非。007以钻石批发商的名义展开了一系列的调查，发现一切原来都是他的死对头魔鬼党的首领艾纳斯...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/09/14-06-48-15-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1553","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM"}}
