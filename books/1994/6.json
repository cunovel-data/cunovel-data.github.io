I noticed Callie\u0027s little blue Volkswagen and decided against getting out of the car. I\u0027d only seen Callie twice since I returned and she\u0027d been ready to claw my eyes out. She\u0027d had her sights on Cain since high school. I\u0027d come home and messed up whatever kind of relationship they\u0027d finally managed to have. I hadn\u0027t meant to. She could have Cain.\n Bethy started to get out of the car and I grabbed her arm. \"Let\u0027s just talk in the car,\" I said, stopping her.\n \"But I want some ice cream mixed with Oreos,\" she complained.\n \"I can\u0027t talk in there. I know too many people,\" I explained.\n Bethy sighed and leaned back in her seat. \"Okay fine. My ass doesn\u0027t need any ice cream and cookies anyway.\"\n I smiled and relaxed, thankful for the dark tinted windows. Knowing I wasn\u0027t on display as people stopped and stared at Jace\u0027s car. No one around here drove cars even close to this one\u0027s league.\n \"I\u0027m not gonna beat around the bush with this, Blaire. I miss you. I\u0027ve never had a close girlfriend before. Ever. Then you came along and then you left. I hate you being gone. Work sucks without you there. I have no one to tell about my sex life with Jace and how sweet he\u0027s being which is something I wouldn\u0027t have if I hadn\u0027t listened to you. I just miss you.\"\n I felt tears sting my eyes. Just being missed felt good. I missed her too. I missed a lot of things. \"I miss you too,\" I replied, hoping I didn\u0027t get all weepy.\n Bethy nodded and a smile tugged on her lips. \"Okay good. Because I need you to come back and live with me.Jace got me a waterfront condo on the club\u0027s property. I, however, refuse to let him pay for it. So I need a roommate. Please come back. I need you. And Woods said you\u0027d have your job back immediately.\"\n Go back to Rosemary? Where Rush was... and Nan... and my dad. I couldn\u0027t go back. I couldn\u0027t see them. They\u0027d be at the club. Would my dad take Nan to play golf? Could I see that? No. I couldn\u0027t. It would be too much.\n \"I can\u0027t,\" I choked out. I wished I could. I didn\u0027t know where I was going to go now that I knew I was pregnant but I couldn\u0027t go to Rosemary and I couldn\u0027t stay here.\n \"Please, Blaire. He misses you too. He never leaves his house. Jace said he\u0027s pitiful.\"\n The angry wound in my chest flared to life. Knowing Rush was hurting too was hard. I\u0027d imagined him having his house parties and moving on. I didn\u0027t want him to still be sad. I just needed for us to move on. But maybe I never would. I\u0027d always have a reminder of Rush.\n \"I can\u0027t see them. Any of them. It would be too hard,\" I stopped. I couldn\u0027t tell Bethy about my pregnancy. I had hardly had time to comprehend it. I wasn\u0027t ready to tell anyone. I might never tell anyone other than Cain. I would be leaving here soon enough. Where I went I wouldn\u0027t know anyone. I\u0027d be starting over.\n \"Your... uh Dad and Georgianna aren\u0027t there. They left. Nan is but she is quieter now. I think she\u0027s worried about Rush. It would be hard at first but after you ripped the bandage off you\u0027d get over them. Over everything. Besides, the way Woods\u0027 eyes lit up when I mentioned you coming back you could distract yourself with him. He is more than interested.\"\n I didn\u0027t want Woods. And nothing would distract me. Bethy didn\u0027t know everything. I couldn\u0027t tell her that either. Not today.\n \"As much as I want to... I just can\u0027t. I\u0027m sorry.\"\n I was sorry. Moving in with Bethy and getting my job back at the club would be the answer to my problems, almost.\n Bethy let out a frustrated sigh and laid her head back on the seat and closed her eyes. \"Okay. I get it. I don\u0027t like it but I get it.\"\n I reached over and squeezed her hand tightly. I wished things were different. If Rush were just some guy I had broken up with it would be. But he wasn\u0027t. He never would be. He was more. Much more than she could understand.\n Bethy squeezed my hand back. \"I\u0027m going to let this go for today. But I\u0027m not looking for another roommate right away. I\u0027m giving you a week to think about this. Then I have to find someone to help me pay the bills. So will you? Think about it?\"\n I nodded because I knew that was what she needed even if I knew her waiting was pointless.\n \"Good. I\u0027ll just go home and pray if God even remembers who the hell I am.\" She winked at me and then reached across the seat to hug me.\n \"Eat some food for me, okay? You\u0027re getting too skinny,\" she said.\n \"Okay,\" I replied, wondering if that were going to be possible.\n Bethy sat back. \"Well, if you aren\u0027t gonna pack up and head back to Rosemary with me then at least let\u0027s go out. I need to stay the night before I do that drive again. We can go find some fun somewhere and then crash at a hotel.\"\n I nodded. \"Yes. That sounds good. Just no honky-tonks.\" I couldn\u0027t walk into another one of those. At least not this soon.\n Bethy frowned. \"Okay... but is there anything else in this state?\"\n She had a point. \"Yeah... we can drive into Birmingham. It\u0027s the closest big city.\"\n \"Perfect. Let\u0027s go have some fun.\"\n When we pulled into the driveway at Granny Q\u0027s she was sitting outside on the porch shelling peas. I didn\u0027t want to face her but she had given me a roof over my head for three weeks with no strings attached. She deserved an explanation if she wanted one. I wasn\u0027t sure Cain had told her anything. His truck wasn\u0027t here and I was immensely grateful.\n \"Want me to stay in the car?\" Bethy asked. It would be easier if she did but Granny Q would see her and call me out for being rude if I didn\u0027t let my friend come inside.\n \"You can come with me,\" I told her and opened the car door.\n Bethy walked around the front of the car and fell into step beside me. Granny Q hadn\u0027t looked up from her peas yet but I knew she\u0027d heard us. She was thinking about what she was going to say. Cain must have told her. Dang it.\n I looked over at her as she continued to shell those peas in silence. Her short white bobbed hair was all I could see of her. No eye contact. It would be so much easier to just go inside and take advantage of her not speaking to me. But this was her home. If she didn\u0027t want me here I needed to pack up and leave.\n \"Hey, Granny Q,\" I said and stopped, waiting for her to lift her head to look at me.\n Silence. She was upset with me. Disappointed or mad; I wasn\u0027t sure which. I hated Cain right now for telling her. Couldn\u0027t he keep his mouth shut?\n \"This is my friend Bethy. She came to visit me today,\" I continued.\n Granny Q finally raised her head and gave Bethy a smile then turned her eyes on me. \"You take her on in and fix her a nice big glass of iced tea and give her one of them fried pies I got cooling on the table. Then you come on back out here and talk to me a minute, hmmm.\" This wasn\u0027t a request; it was a subtle demand. I nodded and led Bethy inside.\n \"Did you piss off the old lady?\" Bethy whispered when we were safely inside.\n I shrugged. I wasn\u0027t sure. \"Don\u0027t know just yet,\" I replied.\n I went to the cabinet and got a tall glass down and went to fixing Bethy a glass of iced tea. I didn\u0027t even ask her if she wanted it. I was just trying to do what Granny Q had said.\n \"Here. Drink this and eat a fried pie. I\u0027ll be back in a few minutes,\" I said and hurried back outside. I needed to get this over with. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/never-too-far-too-far-2/page-6.html","bookId":1994,"book":{"id":1994,"title":"Never Too Far (Too Far #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Never Too Far (Too Far, #2; Rosemary Beach, #2) \n He had held a secret that destroyed her world. \n Everything she had known was no longer true. \n Blaire couldn’t stop loving him but she knew she could never forgive him. \n Now, she was back home and learning to live again.
