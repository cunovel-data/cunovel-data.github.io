{"id":74623,"no":42,"title":"Page 42","content":"Rush\n The house was dark and silent when I unlocked the door and stepped inside. Would Blaire have turned out all the lights if she were here alone? I\u0027d been so focused on getting home to her after talking with Nan that I hadn\u0027t let myself consider she could have left me. Would she have left me?\n I turned and took the stairs two at a time. Once I hit the top step I started running. My heart was pounding in my chest. She couldn\u0027t be gone. I\u0027d told her I loved her. I\u0027d told her I was coming home. She had to be here. I had to tell her everything. I had to tell her things would be different. I had to tell her I remembered her mom. I remembered those Mickey Mouse pancakes. I had to tell her I was going to be the man she needed. I was going to be the best damn father the world had ever known.\n I jerked the door open leading up to my room and darted up the steps needing to see her. God, let her be there. Please let her be there.\n The bed was empty. No. NO! I scanned the room for her things. Something to tell me she hadn\u0027t left me. She couldn\u0027t have left me. I\u0027d chase her down. I\u0027d get on my knees and grovel. I\u0027d be her damn shadow until she gave in and forgave me.\n \"Rush?\" Her voice broke the silence and the pounding in my head and I spun around to see her sitting up on the sofa. Her hair was a tangled mess and her sleepy face was perfect.\n \"You\u0027re here.\" I fell down on my knees before her and dropped my head in her lap. She was here. She hadn\u0027t left me.\n Her hands touched my head as she ran her hands through my hair. \"Yes, I\u0027m here,\" she replied in an unsure voice. I was scaring her but I just needed a minute to reassure myself she hadn\u0027t left me. I hadn\u0027t completely messed this up. I didn\u0027t want to be like her dad. The lost and empty man I\u0027d seen yesterday wasn\u0027t someone I ever wanted to become. And I knew without Blaire I\u0027d be just like that.\n \"Are you okay?\" she asked.\n I nodded but kept my head in her lap. She continued to try and soothe me by gently stroking my head. When I was sure I could talk to her without completely breaking down I lifted my head to look up at her.\n \"I love you.\" The way I said it was so fierce it almost sounded like I was swearing.\n A small sad smile tugged at her lips. \"I know and it\u0027s okay. I understand. I\u0027m not going to make you choose. I just want you to be happy. You deserve to be happy. I\u0027ve had a lot of time to think about it and I\u0027m going to be fine. You don\u0027t have to worry about me. I\u0027m strong. I can do this on my own.\"\n I wasn\u0027t following what she was saying. What was she doing on her own? \"What?\" I asked, replaying her words back in my head.\n \"I talked to my dad today. I know everything. It\u0027s hard to comprehend but it all makes more sense now.\"\n Abe had come here? He\u0027d come and told her everything. She knew... but what she was saying still made no sense.\n \"Baby, maybe it\u0027s because I haven\u0027t slept much in the past eight days or because I\u0027m so fucking relieved that you\u0027re here but I don\u0027t understand what you\u0027re trying to tell me.\"\n A tear glistened in her eye and I jumped up and pulled her into my lap. I didn\u0027t want to make her cry. I thought this was a happy thing. She knew the truth that she\u0027d always known, her mom was as pure and honest as she believed. I was home and I was ready to be everything she deserved in life. I\u0027d die making her happy.\n \"I love you and because I love you I am letting you go. I want you to get out of life what you want. I don\u0027t want to be a chain around your leg.\"\n \"What did you just say?\" I asked as the words \u0027letting me go\u0027 sank in. Like hell she was letting me go.\n \"You heard me, Rush. Don\u0027t make this harder than it is,\" she whispered.\n I stared at her in disbelief. She really meant what she was saying. I\u0027d left her here to think all kinds of things while I\u0027d sat in the hospital with Nan. I should have called but I hadn\u0027t. Of course she was confused.\n \"Listen to me, Blaire. If you try to go anywhere I will chase you down. I will become your shadow. I won\u0027t let you out of my sight because I can\u0027t live without you. I made so many damn mistakes with you I don\u0027t even want to try and count them but I am going to start making things right from here on out. I swear to you that this won\u0027t happen again. I know now that this is where I\u0027m supposed to be. No more lies. Just us.\"\n She sniffled and buried her head in my shoulder. I pulled her tighter up against me. \"I mean it. I need you. You can\u0027t leave me.\"\n \"But I don\u0027t fit. Your family hates me. I make your life difficult.\"\n That\u0027s where she was wrong. \"No. You\u0027re my family. My mother has never been my family. She has never even tried to be. My sister may not have completely come around but she did tell me to ask you if she was going to be able to be apart of her niece or nephews life. So she\u0027s getting there. And as for making my life difficult, you, Blaire Wynn, make my life complete.\"\n Blaire\u0027s mouth covered mine as she grabbed fistfuls of my shirt. Her tongue slid into my mouth and I savored the taste of her. I\u0027d missed her so much. How I could have thought for a minute I\u0027d survive without this... without her, I don\u0027t know. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/never-too-far-too-far-2/page-42.html","bookId":1994,"book":{"id":1994,"title":"Never Too Far (Too Far #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Never Too Far (Too Far, #2; Rosemary Beach, #2) \n He had held a secret that destroyed her world. \n Everything she had known was no longer true. \n Blaire couldn’t stop loving him but she knew she could never forgive him. \n Now, she was back home and learning to live again.
