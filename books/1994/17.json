I stood outside the kitchen mentally preparing myself not to think about the smell. I\u0027d woken up queasy and forced two saltine crackers and some gingerale down but that was all I could manage.\n The moment I walked into the kitchen the smell would hit me. The bacon... oh god, the bacon...\n \"You know sweet thing you have to actually go in there in order to work,\" Jimmy drawled from behind me. I spun around, startled from my internal battle to see him smiling at me with an amused grin. \"The cooks aren\u0027t that bad. You\u0027ll get over the yelling in no time. Besides, last time you had them wrapped around your pretty little finger.\"\n I forced a smile. \"You\u0027re right. I can do this. I\u0027m just not ready for people asking questions, I guess.\" That wasn\u0027t exactly the truth but then it wasn\u0027t a lie either.\n Jimmy opened the door and the smell slammed into me. Eggs, bacon, sausage, grease. Oh, no. My body broke out into a cold sweat and my stomach rolled. \"I, uh, need to use the restroom first,\" I explained and made my way to the employee restroom as fast as I could without breaking into a run. That would look even more suspicious.\n I closed the door behind me and clicked the lock into place as I fell to my knees on the cold tile.I grabbed the toilet as everything I\u0027d eaten last night and this morning came back out.\n Several dry heaves later I stood up still feeling puny.I wet a papertowel to clean my face up. My white polo shirt was clinging to me from the sweat that had broken out all over me. I needed to change.\n I rinsed my mouth with the mouthwash on the counter and straightened my shirt the best I could. Maybe no one would notice. I could do this. I would just hold my breath while I was in the kitchen. That would do it. I\u0027d breathe deeply before going in each time. I had to figure this out.\n When I opened the door my eyes locked on Woods. He was standing against the wall facing the restroom with his arms crossed over his chest studying me. I was late.\n \"I\u0027m sorry. I know I\u0027m late. I just needed to take a quick break before I got started. I promise this won\u0027t happen again. I\u0027ll stay late to make up for it - \"\n \"My office. Now,\" he snapped and turned to stalk down the hallway.\n My heart sped up and I followed quickly behind him. I didn\u0027t want Woods to be mad at me. This job had been my answer for the next few months. Now that I\u0027d talked myself into staying here and figuring out what to do I really didn\u0027t want to leave. Not yet.\n Woods opened the door for me and I stepped inside.\n \"I really am sorry. Please don\u0027t fire me yet. I just - \"\n \"I\u0027m not firing you.\" Woods interrupted me.\n Oh...\n \"Have you seen a doctor? I\u0027m assuming it\u0027s Rush\u0027s. Does he know? Because if he does and you\u0027re here working for me in this condition I\u0027m personally going to go break his fucking neck.\"\n He knew. Oh no, oh no, oh no. I shook my head frantically. I had to stop this. Woods could not know. No one was supposed to know but Bethy. \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about.\"\n Woods cocked an eyebrow. \"Really?\" The disbelief in his voice was unnerving. He wasn\u0027t going to fall for a lie. But I had a baby to protect.\n \"He doesn\u0027t know.\" The truth fell out of my mouth before I could stop it. \"I don\u0027t want him to, yet. I need to find a way to do this on my own. We both know Rush doesn\u0027t want this. His family would hate it. I can\u0027t have my baby hated by anyone. Please understand,\" I begged.\n Woods muttered a curse and ran his hands through his hair. \"He deserves to know this, Blaire.\"\n Yes, he did. But when this baby had been conceived I\u0027d not known just how tainted our worlds were. How impossible it would be for us to have a relationship. \"They hate me. They hate my mom. I can\u0027t. Just, please give me time to prove I can do this without help. I\u0027ll tell him eventually but I need to be stable and ready to leave after I do. This time my wants and his wants don\u0027t come first. I am doing what is best for this baby.\"\n Woods\u0027 frown deepened. We stood in silence for several minutes.\n \"I don\u0027t like it but it isn\u0027t my story to tell. Go change and head out to see Darla. You can do cart rounds today. Let me know when the kitchen smell isn\u0027t so much of an issue.\"\n I wanted to throw my arms around him and hug him. He wasn\u0027t forcing me to tell anyone and he was giving me an out on serving breakfast. I used to love bacon but now... I just couldn\u0027t deal with it. \"Thank you. Dinner isn\u0027t bad. It\u0027s just the morning and sometimes the afternoons.\"\n \"Noted. I\u0027ll only put you on evening shifts in the dining room. This week you just work the course. But don\u0027t get overheated. Keep some ice or something to cool you down. Can I tell Darla?\"\n \"No,\" I replied before he could finish. \"She can\u0027t know. No one can know. Please.\"\n Woods sighed then nodded his head. \"Okay. I\u0027ll keep your secret. But if you need anything you\u0027d better let me know... if you\u0027re not going to let Rush know.\"\n \"Okay. Thank you.\"\n Woods gave me a tight smile. \"I\u0027ll see you later then.\"\n I was dismissed.\n The schedule for the rest of the week had me working the beer cart. There was a tournament a week from Saturday and I was down to work the entire day. I couldn\u0027t be happier about it. The money would be great. And although the heat was intense out on the course all day it was better than being in the air conditioning smelling bacon or any greasy meat and running off to vomit.\n It had progressively gotten busier since I\u0027d left. According to Darla, the members who only came during their summer vacations were all now in residence. Bethy and I ran two different carts in order to keep the place hydrated. Woods was rarely on the course so I didn\u0027t have to worry about his prying eyes. He was busy working. Jace had told Bethy that Woods was trying to prove to his dad that he was ready for a promotion.\n After restocking my cart for the third time today, I headed back to the first hole to make my next round. I recognized the back of Grant\u0027s head right away. He was playing with... Nan. I\u0027d known this day was coming but I hadn\u0027t been prepared for it. I could always skip this hole and let Bethy catch them on her next round but that would only be putting off the inevitable.\n I pulled the cart up and Grant turned in my direction. He looked like he was in a serious conversation with Nan. The frustrated frown on his face wasn\u0027t comforting. He smiled but I could tell it was forced.\n \"We\u0027re good, Blaire. You can go on to the next hole,\" Grant called out. Nan\u0027s head jerked around at the sound of my name and the hateful scowl on her face had me shifting the cart in reverse. Maybe my first instincts had been right. I shouldn\u0027t have stopped.\n \"Wait. I want something.\" At the sound of Rush\u0027s voice my heart did a crazy little flutter thing that only he could make happen. I turned my head toward the sound of his voice to see him jogging toward me in a pair of pale blue shorts and a white polo shirt. It never ceased to amaze me that he could look so ridiculously good in such a preppy outfit. Boys in Bama did not dress like this for anything. They played golf in their jeans, baseball caps and whatever lucky t-shirt or flannel shirt made it out of the dryer that day. But Rush made it look like something mouthwateringly sexy.\n \"I need a drink,\" he said with an easy smile once he got to my cart. He stopped right in front of me. I hadn\u0027t seen him in a couple of days. Not since our road trip.\n \"The usual?\" I asked stepping out of the cart only to be even closer to him. He didn\u0027t back up and our chests were close to brushing against each other. I glanced up at him.\n \"Yeah. That\u0027d be great,\" he replied but didn\u0027t move. He also kept his eyes locked on mine. One of us was going to have to move and break this staring contest. I knew it should be me. I couldn\u0027t lead him to believe anything was different.\n I scooted past him and walked to the back of the cart to get him a Corona. I bent down to pull one out of the ice and I felt him move in behind me. Dangit. He was not making this easy.\n Straightening up, I didn\u0027t look back or turn around. He was too close. \"What are you doing?\" I asked quietly. I didn\u0027t want Nan or Grant to hear us.\n \"I miss you,\" was his simple response.\n Closing my eyes tightly I took a deep breath and tried to calm the frenzy he was sending my heart into. I missed him too. But that didn\u0027t make the truth go away.\n Telling him I missed him wasn\u0027t smart. I didn\u0027t need to let him believe things could go back to the way they were.\n \"Get your drink and come on,\" Nan snapped from behind him. That was enough to make me move. I wasn\u0027t up for a Nan verbal attack. Not today.\n \"Back off, Nan,\" Rush growled and I shoved the Corona at him and moved quickly back to the driver\u0027s seat. \"Blaire, wait,\" Rush said, once again following me.\n \"Don\u0027t do this,\" I begged. \"I can\u0027t handle her.\"\n He winced and then nodded before backing away. I tore my eyes off him and put the cart in drive. Without looking back I headed to the next hole. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/never-too-far-too-far-2/page-17.html","bookId":1994,"book":{"id":1994,"title":"Never Too Far (Too Far #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Never Too Far (Too Far, #2; Rosemary Beach, #2) \n He had held a secret that destroyed her world. \n Everything she had known was no longer true. \n Blaire couldnâ€™t stop loving him but she knew she could never forgive him. \n Now, she was back home and learning to live again.
