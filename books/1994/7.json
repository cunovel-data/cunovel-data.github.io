I let the screen door close behind me with a loud bang before remembering it was old and its springs were long ago rusted. I\u0027d spent many days of my childhood on this front porch shelling peas with Cain and Granny Q. I didn\u0027t want her upset with me. My stomach twisted.\\n\\n \"Sit down girl and stop looking like you\u0027re ready to cry. God knows I love ya like you\u0027re my own. Thought you would be one day.\" She shook her head. \"Stupid boy couldn\u0027t get it together. I hoped he\u0027d wake up \u0027fore it was too late. But he didn\u0027t, did he? You done gone and found ya someone else.\"\\n\\n This had not been what I was expecting. I took the seat across from her and began shelling peas so I wouldn\u0027t have to look at her. \"Cain and I were over three years ago. Nothing that is happening now is affecting that. He is my friend, that\u0027s all.\"\\n\\n Granny Q made ahmph sound and shifted in the porch swing she was sitting in. \"I don\u0027t believe that. You two wereinseparable as kids. Even as a boy he couldn\u0027t keep his eyes off you. It was funny to watch how much he adored you and didn\u0027t even realize it himself. But boys hit them teenage years and lose their ever loving minds. I hate he did. I hate he lost you, girl. \u0027Cause there won\u0027t be another Blaire for Cain. You were it for him.\"\\n\\n She hadn\u0027t mentioned my pregnancy tests. Did she even know I\u0027d bought them? I didn\u0027t want to recap my past with Cain. Sure we had history but there was so much sadness and regret that I didn\u0027t want to go there. I\u0027d been living in a lie my father had constructed then. Remembering it hurt. \"Has Cain come by here today?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"Yeah. He came by this morning looking for ya. I told him you\u0027d not come back home from your early escape. He looked worried and turned and left without telling me anythin\u0027 else. He\u0027d been crying though. Don\u0027t reckon I\u0027ve ever seen him cry before. Least not since he was a boy.\"\\n\\n He\u0027d been crying? I closed my eyes and dropped the peas into the large plastic bucket Granny Q was using. Cain wasn\u0027t supposed to be upset. He wasn\u0027t supposed to cry. He\u0027d let me go a long time ago. Why was this so hard on him? \"How long ago was that?\" I asked, thinking about the hours that had passed since I\u0027d bared my soul to him in the parking lot of the pharmacy.\\n\\n \"Ah, \u0027bout nine hours ago I\u0027d guess. It was early. He was a mess, girl. At least go find him and talk to him. No matter how you feel about him now he needs to hear from you that things are okay.\"\\n\\n I nodded. \"Can I use your phone?\" I asked, standing up.\\n\\n \"Of course you can. Eat you one of them fried pies while you\u0027re in there. I made enough for an army after he ran off this morning. They\u0027re his favorite flavor,\" she said.\\n\\n \"Cherry,\" I replied and she gave me a smile. I could see so many things in those eyes of hers. I knew Cain. Nothing about him surprised me. I understood him. We had a past. I loved his family and they obviously loved me too. This was safe.\\n\\n Bethy was standing on the other side of the door sipping her glass of sweet tea and holding her phone out to me. She\u0027d been listening. I wasn\u0027t surprised.\\n\\n \"Call the boy. Get this over with,\" she said.\\n\\n I took her phone and walked into the living room to give myself some privacy before dialing Cain\u0027s number. I knew it by heart. He\u0027d had the same number since he got his first cell phone when we were sixteen.\\n\\n \"Hello,\" came his reply. I could hear the hesitation in his voice. Something was off. He sounded like he was talking through his nose.\\n\\n \"Cain? Are you okay?\" I asked suddenly worried about him.\\n\\n There was a pause then a long sigh. \"Blaire. Yeah... I\u0027m fine.\"\\n\\n \"Where are you?\"\\n\\n He cleared his throat. \"I, uh... I\u0027m in Rosemary Beach.\"\\n\\n He was in Rosemary? What? I sank down on the sofa behind me and gripped the phone tighter. Was he telling Rush? My heart slammed against my chest and I closed my eyes tightly before asking, \"Why are in you in Rosemary? Please tell me you didn\u0027t...\" I couldn\u0027t say it. Not with Bethy in the other room and more than likely listening to me.\\n\\n \"I needed to see his face. I needed to see if he loved you. I needed to know... because, I just needed to know.\" That made no sense.\\n\\n \"What did you say to him? How did you find him? Did you find him?\" Maybe he hadn\u0027t found him. Maybe I could stop this.\\n\\n There was a hard chuckle on the other end of the line. \"Yeah, I found him alright. Ain\u0027t real hard. This place is small and everyone knows where the rock star\u0027s son lives.\"\\n\\n Oh god, oh god, oh god... \"What did you say to him?\" I asked slowly as horror washed over me.\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t tell him. I wouldn\u0027t do that to you. Give me some damn credit. I cheated on you because I was a horny ass teenage boy but dammit Blaire when are you gonna forgive me? Will I pay for that mistake the rest of my life? I\u0027m sorry! GOD I\u0027m so fucking sorry. I would go back and change everything if I could.\" He stopped and made a grunt that sounded like he was hurting.\\n\\n \"Cain. What\u0027s wrong with you? Are you okay?\" I asked. I didn\u0027t want to acknowledge what he\u0027d said. I knew he was sorry. I was too. But no, I was never going to get over it. Forgiving was one thing. Forgetting was another.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m fine. I\u0027m just a little battered. Let\u0027s just say the guy isn\u0027t crazy about me, okay.\"\\n\\n The guy. Rush? Had Rush hurt him? That didn\u0027t sound like Rush at all. \"What guy?\"\\n\\n Cain sighed, \"Rush.\"\\n\\n My jaw fell open as I stared straight ahead. Rush had hurt Cain? \"I don\u0027t understand.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s okay. I got a room for the night and I\u0027m sleeping this off. I\u0027ll be home tomorrow. We have some things to talk about.\"\\n\\n \"Cain. Why did Rush hurt you?\"\\n\\n Another pause and then a weary sigh. \"Because I asked questions that he didn\u0027t think were my business. I\u0027ll be home tomorrow.\"\\n\\n He asked questions. What kind of questions?\\n\\n \"Blaire, you don\u0027t have to tell him. I\u0027ll take care of you. Just... we need to talk.\"\\n\\n He\u0027d take care of me? What was he talking about? I wasn\u0027t going to let him take care of me. \"Where are you exactly?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"Some hotel just outside of Rosemary. They think their shit don\u0027t stink in that town. Everything there costs five times too much.\"\\n\\n \"Okay. Stay in bed and I\u0027ll see you tomorrow.\" I replied then hung up.\\n\\n Bethy stepped into the room. She cocked one of her dark eyebrows as she stared at me waiting. She\u0027d been listening. I\u0027dknown she would.\\n\\n \"I need a ride to Rosemary,\" I told her standing up. I couldn\u0027t let Cain lay hurt in a hotel room and I couldn\u0027t chance that he\u0027d go back and try to talk to Rush again. If Bethy could drive me there I could check on him and then drive him home.\\n\\n Bethy nodded and a small smile tugged on her lips. I could tell she didn\u0027t want me to see how happy she was to hear this. I wasn\u0027t staying. She didn\u0027t need to get her hopes up. \"This is just about Cain. I\u0027m not... I can\u0027t stay there.\"\\n\\n She didn\u0027t appear to believe me. \"Sure. I know.\"\\n\\n I wasn\u0027t in the mood to convince her. I handed her the phone and headed back to my temporary bedroom to pack some things. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/never-too-far-too-far-2/page-7.html","bookId":1994,"book":{"id":1994,"title":"Never Too Far (Too Far #2)","description":"Storyline: Never Too Far (Too Far, #2; Rosemary Beach, #2) \\n He had held a secret that destroyed her world. \\n Everything she had known was no longer true. \\n Blaire couldn’t stop loving him but she knew she could never forgive him. \\n Now, she was back home and learning to live again.
