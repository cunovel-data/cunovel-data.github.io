My fear that she might change her mind and stay in Sumit kept me quiet until we were safely out of the town limits. Seeing her hands knotted tightly in her lap bothered me. I wish she\u0027d say something. \"You good?\" I asked, unable to stop myself. My need to protect her took over. She nodded. \"Yeah. It\u0027s just a little scary, I guess. This time I know I\u0027m not coming back. I also know I don\u0027t have a dad waiting to help me out. Leaving was harder this time.\" \"You got me,\" I replied. She tilted her head to the side and looked at me. \"Thank you. I needed to hear that right now.\" Hell, I\u0027d record it so she could replay it over and over if it would help. \"Don\u0027t ever think you\u0027re alone.\" She gave me a weak smile then turned her attention back to the road. \"You know I could drive if you would like to sleep this time.\" The idea of being free to look at her all I wanted was tempting. But she\u0027d expect me to sleep and I wasn\u0027t wasting any time I had with her by sleeping through it. \"I\u0027m good. Thanks, though.\" I\u0027d gone through a drive-thru and gotten something to eat on the drive down here. She\u0027d been sleeping and I hadn\u0027t wanted to disturb her but she had to be hungry. \"I\u0027m starving. What sounds good to you?\" I asked, pulling back onto the interstate that would lead us back to Florida. \"Um... I... I don\u0027t know. Maybe soup.\" Soup? That was an odd request. But hell, if she wanted soup I\u0027d get her some soup. \"Soup it is. I\u0027ll keep my eyes open for a restaurant that I know has soup.\" \"If you\u0027re starving please just stop wherever you want. I can find something to eat anywhere.\" She sounded nervous again. \"Blair, I\u0027m getting you soup,\" I replied, glancing over at her. I made sure to smile so she would know I wanted to get her soup. \"Thanks,\" she said and studied her hands in her lap again. We didn\u0027t speak for awhile but it felt good just to have her in the car with me. I didn\u0027t want her to feel like she had to talk. The first exit with food I pointed to the sign. \"Looks like there are good options here. Pick a place,\" I told her. She shrugged. \"Doesn\u0027t matter. You know if you don\u0027t want to get out and want to stay on the road I could eat something car friendly.\" I wanted to draw this day out as long as I possibly could. \"We\u0027re getting soup,\" I replied. A small laugh startled me and I looked over to see her actually smiling. Making her do that more often was a new goal. Blaire was asleep again when we pulled into the parking lot at Bethy\u0027s apartment late that night. I\u0027d been careful to keep our conversation easy. After awhile we\u0027d settled into a comfortable silence then she\u0027d fallen asleep. I put the Rover in park then sat back and looked at her. I\u0027d glanced over at her sleeping a million times on the ride home. Just for a few minutes I wanted the freedom to watch her sleep. The dark circles under her eyes worried me. Was she not sleeping enough? Bethy might know. I could talk to her about it. Asking Blaire questions like that right now probably wasn\u0027t wise. A soft knock on my window tore my attention from Blaire to Jace who was standing outside the car with an amused look on his face. I opened the door and stepped out before he could wake her up. I wanted to wake her up and I didn\u0027t want an audience when I did it. \"You planning on waking her up or are you considering kidnapping?\" Jace asked. \"Shut up, asshole.\" Jace chuckled. \"Bethy\u0027s anxious for her to get back so she can hear about the trip. I\u0027ll help you with her stuff if you\u0027ll wake her up and get her inside.\" \"She\u0027s tired. Bethy can wait until tomorrow.\" I didn\u0027t want her to have to wakeup to a nosy Bethy. She obviously needed more sleep and she needed more food. She\u0027d barely eaten her soup earlier. I\u0027d tried to feed her again but she said she wasn\u0027t hungry. That needed to change. It was like those damn peanut butter sandwiches all over again. \"Then you tell Bethy that,\" Jace replied as I shoved the box in his hands and pulled the suitcase out of the back. \"I got the suitcase; you take the box in and I\u0027ll wake her up.\" \"Private moment?\" Jace smirked and I shoved the box in his hands a little too hard.It caused him to stumble back which only made him cackle with laughter. I ignored him and walked over to the passenger side. Waking her up and letting her leave me wasn\u0027t exactly what I wanted to do. It scared the shit out of me. What if this was it? What if Blaire never let me near her like this again? No. I couldn\u0027t let that happen. I\u0027d work slow but I would make sure this wasn\u0027t it for us. Although having had her to myself all day was going to make it real hard to go back to the way it was. I unbuckled her. She barely stirred. A lock of hair had fallen in her face so I gave in to the urge to touch it. Reaching up I tucked the hair behind her ear. She was so damn beautiful. I\u0027d never move on from her. It wasn\u0027t possible. I had to find a way to get her back. To help her heal. Her eyelids fluttered open and her gaze locked with mine. \"We\u0027re here,\" I whispered, not wanting to startle her. She sat up and gave me a sheepish smile. \"Sorry, I fell asleep on you again.\" \"You must have needed the rest. I didn\u0027t mind.\" I wanted to stay there and keep her in my car but I couldn\u0027t do that. I moved back so she could get out. Asking her if I could see her tomorrow was right there on the tip of my tongue. But I didn\u0027t. She wasn\u0027t ready for that. I had to give her space. \"I\u0027ll see you around then,\" I said and her smile wavered. \"Okay, uh, yeah, see you around. And thanks again for helping me today. I\u0027ll pay you back for the gas.\" Like hell. \"No, you won\u0027t. I don\u0027t want your money. I was glad to help.\" She started to say more but snapped her mouth shut. With a tight nod she turned and walked to the apartment.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/never-too-far-too-far-2/page-16.html","bookId":1994,"book":{"id":1994,"title":"Never Too Far (Too Far #2)","description":"Storyline: Never Too Far (Too Far, #2; Rosemary Beach, #2) He had held a secret that destroyed her world.
