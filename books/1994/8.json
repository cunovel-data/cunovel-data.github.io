He\u0027d come here for some fun and I\u0027d needed the distraction but now that I was here I just wanted to leave. Taking a drink of my beer I tried not to make eye contact with anyone. I kept my head down and a scowl on my face. It wasn\u0027t hard to do.\\n\\n Jace\u0027s words kept replaying in my head. I was scared... No; I was terrified to let myself believe that she\u0027d come back here. I\u0027d seen her face that night in the hotel room. She was empty. The emotion in her eyes was gone. She had been finished- with me, with her father, with everything. Love was cruel. So fucking cruel.\\n\\n The bar stool beside me scraped across the floor as it was moved back. I didn\u0027t look over at it. I didn\u0027t want anyone to talk to me.\\n\\n \"Please tell me that ugly scowl on your pretty face isn\u0027t over a girl. You might break my heart.\" The smooth female voice was familiar.\\n\\n I tilted my head to the side just enough to see her face. Although she was older now I recognized her immediately. There are some things a guy doesn\u0027t forget in life and the girl who takes his virginity is one of them. Meg Carter. She\u0027d been three years older than me and visiting her grandmother the summer I turned fourteen. It hadn\u0027t been a love connection. More like a life lesson.\\n\\n \"Meg,\" I replied, relieved it wasn\u0027t another unknown female here to throw herself at me.\\n\\n \"And he remembers my name. I\u0027m impressed,\" she replied then looked up at the bartender and smiled. \"Jack and Coke please.\"\\n\\n \"Guy doesn\u0027t forget his first.\"\\n\\n She shifted on her stool, crossing her legs and tilting her head to look at me causing her long dark hair to fall over one shoulder. She still wore it long. I\u0027d been fascinated with it back then.\\n\\n \"Most guys don\u0027t but you\u0027ve led a different life compared to most guys. The fame has to have changed you over the years.\"\\n\\n \"My dad\u0027s famous not me,\" I snapped, hating it when females wanted to talk about something they knew nothing about. Meg and I had fucked a few times but she didn\u0027t really know much about me back then.\\n\\n \"Hmmm, whatever. So, why you so glum?\"\\n\\n I wasn\u0027t glum. I was a broken mess. But she wasn\u0027t someone I intended to unload on. \"I\u0027m good,\" I replied and glanced back at the dance floor hoping to catch Grant\u0027s attention. I was ready to go.\\n\\n \"You look like you\u0027ve got a broken heart from hell and don\u0027t know what to do with it,\" she said reaching for her Jack and Coke.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not gonna talk to you about my personal life, Meg.\" I let the warning edge in my voice ring through loud and clear.\\n\\n \"Whoa there, handsome. I wasn\u0027t trying to piss you off. Just making small talk.\"\\n\\n My personal life wasn\u0027t small talk. \"Then ask me about the fucking weather,\" I said with a snarl.\\n\\n She didn\u0027t respond and I was glad. Maybe she\u0027d move on. Leave me alone.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m in town taking care of my Grans. She\u0027s sick and I needed something new to do with my life. I just went through a messy divorce. A change of scenery from Chicago was what I needed. I\u0027ll be here for at least six months. Do you think you\u0027ll be ornery the entire time I\u0027m here or are you gonna get nicer anytime in the near future?\"\\n\\n She wanted to see me. No. I wasn\u0027t ready for that. I started to reply when my phone alerted me of a text message. Relieved to have an interruption so I could think about how I was going to respond to her I pulled it out of my pocket.\\n\\n The number wasn\u0027t one I recognized. But the \"Hey It\u0027s Bethy\" caught my attention and I stopped breathing as I opened the text to read the entire thing.\\n\\n Hey it\u0027s Bethy. If you aren\u0027t a stupid fuck then you\u0027ll wake up and get with the program.\\n\\n What the hell did that mean? What was I missing? Was Blaire in Rosemary? Is that what this meant?I stood up and put enough money on the bar to cover my beer and Meg\u0027s drink. \"I gotta go. It was nice to see you. Take care,\" I said as an after thought as I stalked through the crowd until I found Grant having dry humping on the dance floor with some redhead.\\n\\n His eyes met mine and I nodded at the door. \"Now,\" I said and turned to head outside. I was leaving him here if he hadn\u0027t caught up with me by the time I reached my Range Rover. She could be here. I was going to find out. Asking Bethy what she meant by that jacked up text was pointless. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/never-too-far-too-far-2/page-8.html","bookId":1994,"book":{"id":1994,"title":"Never Too Far (Too Far #2)","description":"Storyline: Never Too Far (Too Far, #2; Rosemary Beach, #2) \\n He had held a secret that destroyed her world. \\n Everything she had known was no longer true. \\n Blaire couldn’t stop loving him but she knew she could never forgive him. \\n Now, she was back home and learning to live again.
