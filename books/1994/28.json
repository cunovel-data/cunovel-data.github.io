It\u0027s been weeks since we\u0027ve had time alone together. I miss you.\" The hurt in Nan\u0027s voice tugged at me. She was right. I was ignoring her. I wasn\u0027t sure what she\u0027d even said since Blaire had walked into the dining room. I\u0027d been so focused on making sure she wasn\u0027t carrying anything too heavy and that no one was mistreating her... or flirting with her, that I hadn\u0027t been much of a lunch date for my sister.\n \"Yeah, I\u0027m sorry,\" I told her and tore my eyes off the door where I\u0027d been watching for Blaire to walk back through. \"Tell me again about this sailing tournament you\u0027re doing with the new guy... you said his name was Charles.\"\n Nan smiled at the mention of the guy\u0027s name and then nodded. She reminded me of the little girl I\u0027d hovered over when she looked all excited about something. Not the angry adult she\u0027d grown up to be. \"Yes. He is the Kellars\u0027 grandson. He\u0027s from Cape Cod and he is big into sailing. He sailed down here for the summer. Anyway, there is a sailing tournament he entered and he wants to take me with him. It\u0027s just for a few days.\"\n I listened as she rattled on about Charles and his sailboat and tried extremely hard not to look around for Blaire. I needed to find a balance between the two women in my life. Blaire came first but I love my sister and she needed me. Even if it was a lunch date listening to her prattle about her latest conquest. No one else ever listened to her talk.\n She stopped talked and scowled at something over my shoulder. \"She needs to focus on her work and stop looking over here at you. God, I don\u0027t know why Woods doesn\u0027t just fire her.\"\n I glanced back to see Woods, Jace, and Thad all smiling and joking around with a blushing Blaire.\n \"She\u0027s not looking now. She\u0027s too busy flirting with other guys. She just cares about the money. It\u0027s pathetic really. I wish you\u0027d see through her ridiculous act. I mean, I can see it - \"\n \"Nan, shut up,\" I growled. I hadn\u0027t meant to but hearing Nan bad mouth Blaire and watching guys flirt with her and make her blush was a little more than I could handle. I was going to go make sure each one of those horny bastards understood she was mine.\n \"You\u0027re going to leave me for her? She\u0027s flirting with them, Rush. I can\u0027t believe you would just get up during our lunch to go stake your claim on some cheap whore.\"\n The jealous rage I had been feeling immediately switched its focus from the guys to my sister. A red haze settled over me as I swung my attention back to her. \"What the fuck did you just say?\" I asked keeping my voice low and even as I towered over her.\n She opened her mouth to speak but I knew I\u0027d lose it if she said anything else bad about Blaire.\n \"Don\u0027t. If you want to walk out of here with your dignity then don\u0027t. If you ever say anything like that about Blaire again I will cut you loose. Do. You. Fucking. Understand.\"\n Nan\u0027s eyes went wide. I\u0027d never spoken to her this hard before. But she\u0027d gone too far. She jumped up and threw her napkin down on the table. \"I can\u0027t believe you. I\u0027m your sister. She\u0027s just... she\u0027s just...\"\n \"She\u0027s just the woman I\u0027m in love with. You need to remember that,\" I finished for her.\n Nan\u0027s eyes flashed fire as she spun around and stalked out of the clubhouse. I didn\u0027t care. I needed her to leave before I said anything else. I didn\u0027t want to hurt her. I loved her but I hated the words that continued to pour out of her mouth.\n A hand touched my arm and I jerked in response before I realized it was Blaire. Her blue eyes were full of concern. This was what she\u0027d been afraid of. Nan and her hate. I couldn\u0027t blame her but I also couldn\u0027t live without Blaire. However, right now I needed to be alone.\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" I whispered then pulled away from her grasp and threw money down on the table before following Nan out of the dining room.\n I spent the next three hours in the gym. My body was physically beat by the time I walked out of there.My anger had faded. I just wanted to see Blaire now. Her shift would be over and I wanted to hold her. She deserved an apology. I should have never taken Nan to the clubhouse to eat. She\u0027d asked that I meet her there for lunch so I\u0027d gone. I\u0027d even made sure we sat in Jimmy\u0027s section. I hadn\u0027t wanted it to be awkward for Blaire. But it had backfired anyway. That was the last time I allowed Nan near her. She can\u0027t get over it and Blaire doesn\u0027t deserve it.\n I knocked on the condo door and waited. No one came. I reached into my pocket and pulled out my phone only to be reminded Blaire had no phone. Dammit. I was going to get her phone from my house and force her to take it back. What if she was hurt? What if she\u0027d gone off somewhere and wasn\u0027t coming back?\n \"She\u0027s out with Jimmy,\" Bethy\u0027s voice called from behind me. I turned around to see Bethy walking up from the direction of the golf course. \"She stopped by after her shift and told me she and Jimmy had a hot date.\"\n Why hadn\u0027t she told me? Because she didn\u0027t know where to find me if she had wanted to tell me. I\u0027d run out on her like an ass. \"When will she be home?\" I asked as Bethy stepped in front of me and unlocked the door.\n \"Don\u0027t know. She was upset. You know anything about that?\" Bethy asked in a sour voice as she pushed the door open.\n I didn\u0027t ask to come in I just followed her in. \"Nan and I had lunch at the clubhouse today. It didn\u0027t go so well.\"\n Bethy scrunched her nose in disgust. \"You think? Whatever for? I can\u0027t imagine your bitch of a sister doing anything to upset Blaire.\" Bethy threw her purse down and muttered a curse word. \"She doesn\u0027t need the stress you know. She\u0027s pregnant and determined to stay on her feet and carry trays around all day. You adding your family drama is not what she needs. Next time you want to have family bonding time with the wicked witch do it somewhere else.\"\n She was right. I shouldn\u0027t have let Blaire see Nan. I should have never trusted Nan to be nice. Or at least be civil. This was my fault and I needed to find Blaire.\n \"Where is she?\" I asked\n Bethy plopped down on the sofa. \"Getting a break from this shit life she\u0027s been handed.\"\n If Bethy wanted to hurt me she was doing a damn good job. I was ready to beg when the door opened.\n \"Sorry I\u0027m late. We went to...\" she trailed off when her eyes met mine. \"Hey.\"\n \"Hey,\" I replied,walking over to stand in front of her but afraid to touch her. \"I\u0027m so sorry. Please come back to your room and let me explain.\"\n She made the first move and wrapped her arms around my waist. \"It\u0027s okay. I\u0027m not upset.\"\n She was going to comfort me. Again. That\u0027s what she always did: worry about other people. \"No, it\u0027s not,\" I replied and took her hand to pull her back to her room. Away from Bethy who wasn\u0027t my biggest fan right now.\n \"Go let him grovel. He needs to. Fuck. I need him to,\" Bethy said from the couch, waving us off and grabbing the remote for the television. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/never-too-far-too-far-2/page-28.html","bookId":1994,"book":{"id":1994,"title":"Never Too Far (Too Far #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Never Too Far (Too Far, #2; Rosemary Beach, #2) \n He had held a secret that destroyed her world. \n Everything she had known was no longer true. \n Blaire couldn’t stop loving him but she knew she could never forgive him. \n Now, she was back home and learning to live again.
