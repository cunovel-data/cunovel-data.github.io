{"id":74596,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"Blaire\n My heart was beating so hard I was sure he could hear it. This had been a bad idea. Being near him was so confusing. It was easy to forget who he was. Having him touch me, even if it was just my face, made me feel like crying. I wanted more than that. I missed him. Everything about him and I\u0027d be lying if the idea of being this close to him all day hadn\u0027t kept me up most of the night.\n Rush turned the radio back up when I didn\u0027t say anything. I should say something after that but what? How did I respond to that without just causing us both more pain? Telling him I missed him and I wanted him wouldn\u0027t make this easier. It would just be harder.\n This time when the phone rang the computer looking screen in his car flashed the name \"Grant.\" Rush pressed some button and then picked up his cell phone.\n \"Hey,\" he said into the phone. I chanced a glance over at him since his focus was no longer on me. The hard frown lines in his face made me sad. I didn\u0027t want them there.\n \"Yeah. We\u0027re on our way,\" he replied into the phone. \"Don\u0027t think that\u0027s a good idea. I\u0027ll call you when I\u0027m back.\" His jaw clenched and I knew whatever Grant was saying was making him mad. \"I said no,\" he growled and ended the call before tossing it into his cup holder.\n \"You okay?\" I asked before I could think that through.\n He jerked his head over to look at me. It was as if he was startled that I was talking to him. \"Uh, yeah. I\u0027m fine,\" he replied in a much calmer tone then turned his eyes back on the road.\n I waited a few minutes then decided to say something about what he\u0027d said to me. If I didn\u0027t start talking about this with him we would always have this awkward silence between us. Even if I left in four months and never saw him again... No, I\u0027d see him again. I would have to, wouldn\u0027t I? Could I really never tell him about this baby? I pushed that back. I hadn\u0027t even been to the doctor yet. I\u0027d cross that bridge when we got to it. Even if I had thrown up again this morning when I\u0027d opened the trash compactor and gotten a whiff of the left over fried fish Jace had tossed last night. I wasn\u0027t normally so sensitive. The hot ginger tea I\u0027d been drinking when Rush picked me up had helped ease my stomach. I could pretend like that pregnancy test was wrong or face the truth.\n \"About what you said. I, uh, I don\u0027t really know how to respond to that. I mean, I know how I feel and how I wish things were different but they aren\u0027t. I want us to... I want us to find a way to be friends... maybe. I don\u0027t know. That sounds so lame. After everything,\" I stopped because my attempt at talking to him about this was sounding like a rambling mess. How could we be friends? That had been how all this started and here I was in love with and pregnant by a man I could not build a future with.\n \"I\u0027ll be whatever you allow me to be, Blaire. Just don\u0027t shut me out again. Please.\"\n I nodded. Okay. I\u0027d give this friends thing time. Then... then I would tell him about the baby. He was either going to run like hell or want to be a part of our baby\u0027s life. Either way I needed time to prepare. Because I would not let my child have anything to do with his family, ever. It was out of the question. I hated liars... but I was about to become one for awhile. This time it was me that had a secret to keep.\n \"Okay,\" I replied but didn\u0027t say more. My eyes were growing heavy and the lack of sleep from last night and the fact I couldn\u0027t drink caffeine to wake me up was getting to me. I closed my eyes.\n \"Easy, sweet Blaire. Your head is falling over and you\u0027re gonna have one helluva cramp in your neck. I\u0027m just laying your seat back.\" A deep warm whisper tickled my ear and I shivered. I turned toward it but I was still so sleepy I couldn\u0027t wake up completely. Something soft brushed my lips then I fell back into my dreams.\n \"You need to wake up, sleepyhead. I\u0027m here but I have no idea where to go,\" Rush\u0027s voice accompanied by his hand gently squeezing my arm woke me. I rubbed my eyes and opened them. I was laying back. I looked over at Rush and he smiled.\n \"I couldn\u0027t let you jack up your neck. Besides, you were sleeping so hard I wanted you to be comfortable.\" He unbuckled and reached across me to fiddle with a button on the side of my seat. It slowly eased back up and I could see the one traffic light in Sumit, Alabama in front of me.\n \"I\u0027m so sorry. I slept the whole way. That had to be a boring ride.\"\n \"I got to control the radio so it wasn\u0027t a bust,\" Rush replied with a smirk and then looked back at the traffic light. \"Where do I go from here?\"\n \"Straight until you see the large wooden sign that is painted red and says \"Fresh Produce and Firewood for Sale\" and then take a left. It\u0027ll be the third house on the right but it\u0027s about a mile and a half down that road. The road will turn into gravel after about a quarter mile.\"\n Rush followed my directions and we didn\u0027t say much. I was still waking up and my stomach was feeling queasy. I hadn\u0027t eaten yet and I knew that was the problem. I had saltine crackers in my purse that Bethy had given me but popping one of those in my mouth in front of Rush was a bad idea. Saltines were a major giveaway.\n By the time we pulled into Granny Q\u0027s driveway I had broken into a cold sweat. I was going to be sick if I didn\u0027t eat something. I opened the door to get out before Rush could see my face. I was probably green or pale at the very least.\n \"You want me to go with you or is it best if I stay here?\" he asked.\n \"Oh, um... maybe you should stay here,\" I replied. Cain\u0027s truck was here so that meant he probably was too. I didn\u0027t want Rush and Cain getting into any more fights. I also didn\u0027t trust Cain to keep his mouth shut about the pregnancy tests. I closed the car door and headed for the house.\n Cain opened the screen door and stepped outside before I even made it to the bottom step. His face was a mixture of worry and anger. \"Why\u0027s he here? He brought you home, now he can leave,\" Cain snarled, looking past me toward Rush. Yeah, it was a real good idea for Rush to stay in the car. My stomach rolled and I fought back the nausea.\n \"Because he\u0027s giving me a ride back. Calm down, Cain. You have no fight with him. You\u0027re my friend. He\u0027s my friend. Let\u0027s you and I take this inside. I need to get my things.\"\n Cain stepped back and let me pass him then he followed me inside letting the screen slam shut behind him.\n \"What do you mean you\u0027re going back with him? That test come back positive? You running back to him now even though he broke your heart so bad you came here three weeks ago a mess? I\u0027ll take care of you Blaire. You know that.\"\n I held up my hands to stop him. \"This isn\u0027t about me being pregnant, Cain. He is a friend who gave me a ride. Yes, we were more before... things happened but now we\u0027re not. I\u0027m not running to him. I am getting my job back in Rosemary and living with Bethy for a while. Then I\u0027ll go somewhere else and start over. I just can\u0027t keep staying here.\"\n \"Why can\u0027t you stay here? Hell Blaire, I\u0027ll marry you today. No questions asked. I love you. More than life. You gotta know that. I messed up when we were younger and that thing with Callie, she don\u0027t mean nothin\u0027. She\u0027s just a girl who distracts me. You\u0027re all I want. I\u0027ve been telling you that for years. Please listen to me,\" he was begged.\n \"Cain, stop this. You\u0027re my friend. What we had died a long time ago. I walked in on you doing things to another girl you shouldn\u0027t have been. That night everything changed. I love you but I am not in love with you and I never will be again. I need to pack and I need to move on with my life.\"\n Cain slammed his hand against the wall. \"Don\u0027t say that! It isn\u0027t over. You can\u0027t just run off on your own. It isn\u0027t safe!\" He paused. \"Are you pregnant?\" he asked.\n I didn\u0027t answer. Instead, I walked back to the room I\u0027d been staying in while I was here and started packing my suitcase. \"You are,\" he said, following me into the room.\n I didn\u0027t respond. I just focused on my things. \"Does he know? Is the rock star\u0027s son gonna take responsibility? He\u0027s lying, B. The baby will get here and he will run. He won\u0027t be able to handle it. A baby doesn\u0027t fit into his life. You know that. Hell, the world knows that. He might as well be a rock star himself. I saw his beach house. That ain\u0027t someone that\u0027ll be there when things get tough. They don\u0027t stick it out. I may have screwed up but I won\u0027t run. I\u0027ll always be here.\"\n I spun around. \"He doesn\u0027t know, okay. I\u0027m not sure I\u0027ll even tell him. I don\u0027t want someone to save me. I can do this. I\u0027m not helpless.\"\n He started to open his mouth to argue when Granny Q walked into the room. I hadn\u0027t realized she was here.\n \"Stop begging her, Cain. You done made your bed boy, go lie in it. She moved on. Her heart has moved on. She\u0027s done shown us all she can go to school and take care of her sick momma and herself.\" She looked from Cain to me and a sad smile touched her lips.\n \"Breaks my heart that you got another hurdle like this to leap so young and this room is yours if you need it. But if you\u0027re set on leaving then I bless that too. You just be safe.\" She walked over and pulled me into a hug. \"I love you like you\u0027re my own. Always have,\" she whispered into my hair.\n Tears stung my eyes. \"I love you too.\"\n She pulled back and sniffed. \"You keep in touch,\" she said and started to leave then glanced back at me. \"Every man deserves to know he has a baby. Even if\u0027n he ain\u0027tgonna be a part of its life he needs to know about it. You just keep that in mind.\"\n She walked out of the room leaving Cain and I alone again. I put the last of my things in my suitcase and zipped it shut. Grabbing the handle, I picked it up. My nausea had gotten worse. I covered my mouth with one hand.\n \"Shit, B. You can\u0027t do that. Give it to me. You\u0027re not supposed to pick up heavy stuff. See, you can\u0027t do this. Who isgonna make sure you take care or yourself?\"\n The best friend I\u0027d had all my life was back and the crazy boy who thought he was in love and ready to sacrifice his life was gone. \"I told Bethy. She knows and I\u0027m careful. I wasn\u0027t thinking. This is all new for me. And I think I\u0027m gonna be sick.\"\n \"What can I do?\" he asked with a panicked look on his face.\n \"Crackers would help.\"\n He set the suitcase down and ran out of the room to get me crackers. He was back in less than a minute with a box of saltines and a glass. \"Granny Q heard you. She already had the box out and a glass of ginger ale poured. She said the ale would soothe your stomach.\"\n \"Thank you,\" I replied and sat down on the bed to eat a cracker and sip on the ginger ale. Neither of us spoke. My nausea began to ease away and I had learned from experience to stop eating then. Too much and I\u0027d be seeing it again very soon. Standing up, I handed the box and glass back to Cain.\n \"Just put it down. I\u0027ll get it later.\" He picked up my suitcase. \"Give me that box too. You can\u0027t carry it,\" he said picking up the box of things I hadn\u0027t unpacked from my last move. I pulled the last small bag up on my arm and he started for the door without another word. I followed him praying he didn\u0027t do something stupid when he saw Rush.\n We got to the screen door leading out onto the front porch and he stopped.Putting the suitcase down he turned back to look at me.\n \"You don\u0027t have to go with him. I told you that I could fix this. You have me, B. You\u0027ve always had me.\"\n Cain believed what he was saying. I could see it in his face. But I knew better. If I needed a friend, Cain would be there but he was no one\u0027s savior. I didn\u0027t need one anyway. I had myself.\n I pulled my bag up higher on my shoulder and thought carefully about how to explain this to him one more time. I\u0027d tried everything. He wouldn\u0027t understand the truth. Bringing up how he had failed me when my mom was sick and I was so alone would only hurt him. \"I need to do this.\"\n Cain let out a frustrated growl and ran his hand through his hair. \"You don\u0027t trust me to take care of you. That hurts so damn much.\" He let out a defeated laugh. \"But then why should you? I let you down before. With your mom... I was a kid, B. How many times do I have to tell you that things are different now? I know what I want. I... God, B, I want you. It\u0027s always been you.\"\n A lump formed in my throat. Not because I loved him but because I did care for him. Cain was a big part of my life. He had been for as long as I could remember. I closed the distance between us and reached out for his hand. \"Please, understand. This is something I have to do. I have to face this. Let me go.\"\n Cain let out a weary sigh. \"I\u0027m always letting you go, B. You\u0027ve asked that of me before. I keep trying but it\u0027s slowly destroying me.\"\n One day he would thank me for leaving him. \"I\u0027m sorry, Cain. But I need to go. He\u0027s waiting on me.\"\n Cain picked the suitcase back up and opened the screen door with his shoulder. Rush stepped out of the Rover as soon as he saw us. \"Don\u0027t say anything to him, Cain.\" I whispered.\n Cain nodded and I followed him down the steps. Rush met us at the bottom and looked up at me. \"Is this all your stuff?\" he asked.\n \"Yeah,\" I replied.\n Cain didn\u0027t make a move to give him the suitcase and box. A muscle in Rush\u0027s jaw jumped and I knew he was trying really hard to be good.\n \"Give him the stuff, Cain,\" I said, nudging him in the back.\n Cain sighed and handed the box and suitcase to Rush who took both items and headed for the Rover.\n \"You need to tell him,\" Cain muttered when he turned around to look at me.\n \"I will, eventually. I need to think it through.\"\n Cain looked past me toward my truck. \"You leaving your truck?\"\n \"I was hoping you might could stick it up at the bodyshop and put a for sale sign on it. Maybe get a thousand out of it. Then you could keep half and send me the other half.\"\n Cain frowned. \"I\u0027ll sell the truck, B, but I ain\u0027t taking no money. I\u0027ll send it all.\"\n I didn\u0027t argue with him. He needed to be able to do this and I\u0027d let him. \"Okay, fine. But could you give Granny Q some of it at least? For letting me stay here and all.\"\n Cain\u0027s eyebrows shot up. \"You want my Granny to ride her ass down to Rosemary to tan your hide?\"\n Smiling, I closed the distance between us and holding onto his shoulders I stood on my tiptoes and placed a kiss on his cheek. \"Thank you, for everything,\" I whispered.\n \"You can come back if you need me. Always.\" His voice cracked and I knew I needed to go. I stepped back and nodded once before walking to the Rover.\n Rush had the door open on the passenger side when I got there and he closed it behind me. I watched as he looked back at Cain before going and getting in on his side. I was really doing this. Letting go of what was safe and taking the first move in finding my place in the world. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/never-too-far-too-far-2/page-15.html","bookId":1994,"book":{"id":1994,"title":"Never Too Far (Too Far #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Never Too Far (Too Far, #2; Rosemary Beach, #2) \n He had held a secret that destroyed her world. \n Everything she had known was no longer true. \n Blaire couldn’t stop loving him but she knew she could never forgive him. \n Now, she was back home and learning to live again.
