I actually just wanted to clean her up. I liked it. No, I fucking loved it. Knowing I\u0027d been there and I was taking care of her did something to me.\n \"You don\u0027t need to clean me up. I\u0027m fine,\" she replied as she reached for her discarded dress and slipped it back on without making eye contact with me. Shit. Had I read her wrong? I thought she wanted this. No. I knew she wanted it. She\u0027d been so damn hungry for it.\n \"Blaire, look at me.\"\n She paused and picked up her panties. I swallowed hard as she stepped into them and slid them back up her body. I needed her again. She couldn\u0027t walk away from me now. I wasn\u0027t going to be able to live through it if she did.\n \"Blaire, please look at me,\" I begged.\n Stopping, she took a deep breath then lifted her eyes to meet mine. The sadness there was mixed with something else. Embarrassment? Surely not. I reached over and cupped her face with my hand. \"What\u0027s wrong? Did I do something you didn\u0027t want me to? Because I was trying not to lose control. I was trying real hard to do what you wanted.\"\n \"No. You... you didn\u0027t do anything wrong.\" She dropped her eyes from mine again. \"I just need to think. I need some space. I didn\u0027t... I wasn\u0027t... We shouldn\u0027t have done that.\"\n Stabbing me in the chest would have been less painful. I wanted to pull her to me and go all cave man claiming she was mine and couldn\u0027t leave me. But then I could lose her. I couldn\u0027t go through that again. I had to do this her way. I let my hand fall from her face and I stepped back so she could leave.\n Blaire lifted her face to look up at me again. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" she whispered, then opened the door and escaped.\n She had just blown my world away with amazingly hot sex and she was sorry. Fantastic.\n When I finally emerged from the bathroom Blaire was gone. Jace smirked and Bethy made excuses for her. I didn\u0027t want to be there anymore either. After I made sure all the heavy stuff was moved and Blaire\u0027s suitcase and box were packed up I left. I couldn\u0027t stay there while the two of them watched me. They\u0027d heard us. Blaire had been loud. I wasn\u0027t ashamed; I was just tired of them looking at me and waiting on me to say something to explain Blaire\u0027s departure.\n I gave Blaire a couple days to come to me. She hadn\u0027t. I wasn\u0027t surprised. But she\u0027d asked for space and I\u0027d given her all the space I could handle. I didn\u0027t call anyone to play a round of golf with me. I didn\u0027t want anyone around when Blaire showed up. We needed to talk. No distractions or excuses for her to ride off.\n It had sounded like a firm plan but after six holes and no cart girl I was beginning to wonder. Just as I was about to walk to the next hole I heard the sound of the cart. I stopped and turned around. The blood that had started pumping through my veins from the idea of seeing Blaire out here and having her alone froze when I realized it was that blond girl that I\u0027d seen training a few times with Bethy. Shit.\n I shook my head and waved her on. I didn\u0027t want a drink from her. She smiled brightly and drove on to the next stop.\n \"It\u0027s hot out here. You sure you don\u0027t want something?\" Meg\u0027s voice asked and I glanced back to see her walking up dressed in a white tennis skirt and polo. She\u0027d been big into tennis ten years ago too.\n \"Wrong cart girl,\" I replied and waited on her to catch up to me.\n \"You only buy from one?\"\n \"Yep.\"\n Meg looked thoughtful then nodded. \"I see. You have a thing for a cart girl.\"\n \u0027A thing\u0027 didn\u0027t even scratch the surface. I pulled my golf bag up on my shoulder and started walking to the next hole. I wasn\u0027t going to respond to that comment.\n \"And he\u0027s touchy about it,\" Meg quipped. That annoyed me.\n \"Or it\u0027s just not your business.\"\n She let out a low whistle. \"So it\u0027s more than a thing.\"\n I stopped and leveled my gaze on her. Just because she was my first fuck didn\u0027t mean we had any kind of bond or friendship. This was pissing me off. \"Let it go,\" I warned.\n Meg put her hands on her hips and her jaw fell open. \"Oh my god... Rush Finlay has fallen in love. Holy shit! I never thought I\u0027d see the day.\"\n \"You haven\u0027t seen me in ten years, Meg. How the hell do you know anything about me?\" The annoyed snarl in my voice didn\u0027t even make her flinch.\n \"Listen, Finlay. Just because you haven\u0027t seen me in ten years doesn\u0027t mean I haven\u0027t seen or heard about you. I\u0027ve been back in town several times but you were always partying it up at casa de Finlay and screwing every model perfect body that came your way. I didn\u0027t see a point in showing back up in your life. But yeah, I\u0027ve seen you and like the rest of this town I know that you\u0027re a rich, gorgeous player who can have his pick of the litter.\"\n I sounded shallow. I didn\u0027t like the picture she painted of me. Did Blaire see me that way? Not only can she not trust me to choose her and protect her butshe must think I\u0027ll just move on when someone else comes along. Surely she knows that isn\u0027t true.\n \"She\u0027s amazing. No... she\u0027s perfect. Everything about her is fucking perfect,\" I said aloud then shifted my gaze back to Meg. \"I don\u0027t just love her, she owns me. Completely. I\u0027d do anything for her.\"\n \"But she doesn\u0027t feel the same way?\" Meg asked.\n \"I hurt her. Not the way you\u0027re thinking either. The way I hurt her is hard to explain. There is so much pain in what happened that I don\u0027t know if I can ever get her back.\"\n \"Is she a cart girl?\"\n She was really hung up on the cart girl thing. \"Yeah she is,\" I paused and wondered if I should tell her exactly who Blaire was. Saying it aloud to someone and admitting this might help me make sense of it. \"She and Nan have the same father.\" I hadn\u0027t meant to say it like that.\n \"Shit,\" Meg muttered. \"Please tell me she\u0027s nothing like your evil little sister.\"\n Nan had very few fans. I didn\u0027t even flinch at the accusation that she was evil. She\u0027d brought this on herself. \"No. She\u0027s nothing like Nan.\"\n Meg was quiet a moment and I wondered if this was as far as this conversation was going to go. Then she shifted her feet and pointed back toward the clubhouse. \"Why don\u0027t we go have some lunch and you can tell me all about this very strange situation and I\u0027ll see if I can\u0027t come up with some wisdom or at the very least female advice.\"\n I needed any advice I could get. There were no females in my life I could ask for help. \"Yeah, okay. Sounds good. You give me any advice I can use and lunch is on me.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/never-too-far-too-far-2/page-22.html","bookId":1994,"book":{"id":1994,"title":"Never Too Far (Too Far #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Never Too Far (Too Far, #2; Rosemary Beach, #2) \n He had held a secret that destroyed her world. \n Everything she had known was no longer true. \n Blaire couldn’t stop loving him but she knew she could never forgive him. \n Now, she was back home and learning to live again.
