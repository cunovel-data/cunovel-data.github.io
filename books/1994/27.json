I curled up in his arms and sighed in relief. He\u0027d made all the achy, needy parts of me very happy. More than happy. I was sore all over and I loved it.\\n\\n \"I think you may have broken me,\" he chuckled against my temple and placed a kiss there.\\n\\n \"I hope not because when I have the energy to move I\u0027d like to do that again,\" I replied as sweetly as I could.\\n\\n \"Why am I suddenly feeling used?\" he asked.\\n\\n I pinched at the skin that covered his abs. \"I\u0027m sorry you feel used but with a body like yours what do you expect?\"\\n\\n Rush laughed and rolled me onto my back before covering me with his body. His silver eyes sparkled as he stared down at me. \"Is that so?\"\\n\\n I only nodded. I was afraid I\u0027d say something else if I spoke. Like the fact thatI was in love with him.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re so beautiful,\" he whispered as he lowered his head to kiss my face as if it were something to be cherished.\\n\\n I wasn\u0027t the beautiful one. He was but I didn\u0027t point that out. If he wanted to think I was then I\u0027d let him. His hands ran down my body making it hum with pleasure. \"Are you waking up every morning like this?\" he asked with a gleam in his eyes.\\n\\n I could lie but I\u0027d done enough of that. \"Yes. Sometimes in the middle of the night too.\"\\n\\n Rush raised an eyebrow. \"The middle of the night?\"\\n\\n I nodded.\\n\\n He reached up and brushed hair out of my face. \"How am I supposed to help you in the middle of the night if you\u0027re not with me?\" His voice sounded truly concerned.\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t want me waking you up for sex every night,\" I told him.\\n\\n \"Baby, if you wake up horny I want to be ready and available.\" His voice dropped and he slipped a hand down to cup me between my legs. \"This is mine and I take care of what\u0027s mine.\"\\n\\n \"Rush,\" I warned.\\n\\n \"Yes?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to straddle you right here and screw your brains out if you don\u0027t stop saying things like that.\"\\n\\n Rush grinned. \"That isn\u0027t much of a threat, sweet Blaire.\"\\n\\n I turned my head to grin and the clock on my bedside table caught my attention. Oh crap! I pushed at Rush. \"I have to be at work in ten minutes,\" I yelled in way of explanation.\\n\\n Rush moved off me and I jumped out of bed only to realize I was very naked and Rush was lying on the bed watching me panic with a smile.\\n\\n \"Please don\u0027t mind me. The view is great from here,\" he said with a sexy grin.\\n\\n I shook my head and grabbed a clean pair of panties and a bra then ran to the bathroom.\\n\\n \"Looks like someone got lucky or is that happy smile from all those donuts I brought over?\" Jimmy drawled when I walked into the kitchen one minute late.\\n\\n My face felt like it was on fire. \"I loved the donuts. Thank you and I\u0027m sorry I forgot last night. It was a uh... crazy day,\" I replied,picking out an apron and afraid to make eye contact with him.\\n\\n \"Baby, if I\u0027d just crawled out of bed with Rush Finlay I\u0027d be grinning like mad too. In fact, I\u0027m envious as hell. I know my donuts didn\u0027t put that satisfied gleam in your eyes.\"\\n\\n I started giggling and grabbed a pen and pad. \"He is pretty amazing.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, please give me details. I\u0027ll hang on every word,\" Jimmy begged walking out into the dining room beside me.\\n\\n \"Go flirt with women and stop fantasizing about my... my...\" What was Rush? He wasn\u0027t my boyfriend. He was my baby daddy and that just sounded cheap.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s your man. Say it because it\u0027s true. The guy worships at your altar.\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t respond. I wasn\u0027t sure how to respond. There were tables already filling up and I had a job to do. Woods, Jace, and Thad, the blond with curly hair whose name I\u0027d just recently found out, were sitting at one of my tables. I went to get the drink orders from Mister Lovelady and his companion today. He always had girls with him that looked like they could be his granddaughters but they never were. According to Jimmy, Mister Lovelady was richer than God. Still, he was old. That was just gross.\\n\\n After I got their drink orders I headed for Woods\u0027 table. All three guys smiled at me as I approached and Thad winked. He was the pretty boy who liked to flirt and everyone knew it. So ignoring him was easy. \"Good afternoon, boys. What can I get you three to drink?\" I asked as I put their water glasses in front of them.\\n\\n \"You look chipper this morning. It\u0027s nice to see you smiling again,\" Thad said as he reached for his glass of water and took a sip.\\n\\n The blush was back in my cheeks. I could feel it. I glanced over at Woods who was watching me with a knowing look. He was smart enough to figure it out. \"I\u0027ll have coffee,\" was Woods\u0027 only reply. I was extremely thankful he wasn\u0027t in the mood to tease me.\\n\\n \"Bethy wouldn\u0027t let me touch the donuts Jimmy brought over this morning. I didn\u0027t realize donuts would put you in such a good mood.\" The smirk on Jace\u0027s face said he knew exactly what had happened. Was the entire club going to know about my sex life now? Was it that interesting?\\n\\n \"I happen to love donuts,\" I replied, studying my pad instead of looking at any of them.\\n\\n \"I just bet you do,\" Jace chuckled. \"Bring me a Honey Brown, please.\"\\n\\n \"I feel like I\u0027m missing something here and I hate being left out,\" Thad said leaning on the table and inspecting me closer.\\n\\n \"Back off and order your damn drink,\" Woods snapped at him.\\n\\n Thad rolled his eyes and leaned back in his seat. \"Everyone\u0027s so touchy. I\u0027ll have a bottle of spring water.\"\\n\\n I wrote it down then glanced down at Woods. \"Would you like me to bring fresh fruit to the table?\"\\n\\n He nodded. \"Please.\"\\n\\n Glad to be done with those three I headed back to the kitchen after being stopped by Mrs. Higgenbotham who wanted a Mimosa for her and her daughter who looked to be about eighteen.\\n\\n Jimmy was loading up his tray when I walked back into the kitchen. He glanced back at me over his shoulder. \"I know I\u0027m being nosy but I gotta ask, who was the girl Rush ran off and left here yesterday?\"\\n\\n Meg. I didn\u0027t know anything else about her. Just Meg, an old friend. I had actually forgotten that Rush had left her here. \"She\u0027s an old friend of his. I don\u0027t know much else.\"\\n\\n \"Woods knew her well too. He went and talked to her after the two of you ran off. I figured she wasn\u0027t new if they both knew her.\"\\n\\n I reminded myself that she was a part of his past. I had no reason to feel jealous of her in any way. They were old friends. Just because she was one of them didn\u0027t mean I had to feel inferior.\\n\\n I put Woods\u0027 fruit on my tray and grabbed the drinks everyone had ordered before going back into the dining room.\\n\\n I focused on delivering drinks to my tables before doing a sweep of the room while I walked toward Woods\u0027 table. I saw Woods cut his eyes from me to a table to my left. It was in Jimmy\u0027s area. I glanced back to see if that was a hint for me to help someone when my eyes locked with Rush\u0027s. I stopped. He was here. A smile started to form on my lips when my eyes shifted to see Nan sitting beside him with an angry snarl on her face. I swung my attention back to Woods and decided to pretend they weren\u0027t here.\\n\\n \"Here\u0027s your fruit.\" I could hear the nervous tone in my voice and I prayed the guys didn\u0027t notice. \"And here are your drinks. Y\u0027all ready to order now?\" I asked, forcing a smile.\\n\\n All three of them stared up at me making this all the more uncomfortable. This was something I was going to have to learn to get over. Nan was his sister. She\u0027d be in my life if Rush was. Learning to live with someone hating me was a part of life I\u0027d need to learn to accept.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s his sister. You do this thing with him and you have to deal with her too,\" Jace told me as if I didn\u0027t already know this. I didn\u0027t like feeling as if every emotion I had was on display. I\u0027d always been a private person. This was too much.\\n\\n I ignored him pulling my pad out and looked pointedly at Woods. He cleared his throat and ordered. The others did too without anymore words of wisdom. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/never-too-far-too-far-2/page-27.html","bookId":1994,"book":{"id":1994,"title":"Never Too Far (Too Far #2)","description":"Storyline: Never Too Far (Too Far, #2; Rosemary Beach, #2) \\n He had held a secret that destroyed her world. \\n Everything she had known was no longer true. \\n Blaire couldn’t stop loving him but she knew she could never forgive him. \\n Now, she was back home and learning to live again.
