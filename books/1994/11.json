I\u0027d get a job somewhere else but I need the money the club pays.\" I was explaining this to myself as much as I was explaining it to Rush. I hadn\u0027t been sure exactly what I was going to say when I showed up here. I just knew I had to face him. At first Bethy had begged me to tell him about the pregnancy. However, after she\u0027d heard exactly what happened with my father and Nan and her mother that day she hadn\u0027t been as Team Rush as before. She agreed that there was no need to tell him anything right away.\n Working up enough nerve to drive back to this house after the way I\u0027d left only three and a half weeks ago had been hard. The hope that my heart wouldn\u0027t react when I saw Rush\u0027s face had been futile. My chest had constricted so badly it had been a wonder I could breathe. Much less speak. I was pregnant with his baby... our baby. But the lies. The deceit. Who he was. All of that kept me from saying the words that he deserved to hear. I couldn\u0027t. It was wrong. I was being selfish. I knew it. That didn\u0027t change anything. The baby I was carrying might never know him. I couldn\u0027t let the way I felt about him cloud my decisions for my future... or my baby\u0027s future. My father, his mother and his sister would never be a part of my baby\u0027s life. I wouldn\u0027t allow it. I couldn\u0027t.\n \"Of course. Yeah, working at the club is good money.\" He stopped and ran a hand through his hair. \"Blaire, nothing has changed. Not for me. You don\u0027t need my permission.This is exactly what I want. Having you here again. Seeing your face. God, baby, I can\u0027t do this. I can\u0027t pretend I\u0027m not fucking thrilled you\u0027re standing in my house right now.\"\n I couldn\u0027t look at him. Not now. I hadn\u0027t been expecting him to say any of those things. The stilted nervous conversation was more of what I expected. It was what I wanted. My heart couldn\u0027t take anything else. \"I need to go, Rush. I can\u0027t, I just wanted to make sure you were good with me being in town. I\u0027ll keep my distance.\"\n Rush moved so fast I didn\u0027t realize it until he was standing between me and the door. \"I\u0027m sorry. I was trying to be cool. I was trying to be careful but I cracked. I\u0027ll do better. I promise. Go to Bethy\u0027s. Forget what I just said. I\u0027ll be good. I promise. Just... just don\u0027t leave. Please.\"\n What did I say to that? He\u0027d managed to make me want to comfort him. To apologize to him. He was lethal to my emotions and good sense. Distance. We needed distance. I nodded and stepped around him. \"I\u0027ll... uh... probably see you around.\" I managed to croak out before opening the door and stepping outside the house.\n I didn\u0027t look back but I knew he was watching me leave. It was the only reason I didn\u0027t break out into a run. Space... we needed space. And I needed to cry.\n It was as if he had known I was coming. I\u0027d already decided to go straight to the dining room and look for Jimmy. I figured Jimmy would know where to find Woods. But Woods had been waiting on me at the door when I opened the back entrance to the clubhouse.\n \"And she returns. Honestly didn\u0027t think you would,\" Woods drawled as the door closed behind me.\n \"For a little while maybe,\" I replied.\n Woods winked at me then nodded his head toward the hall that led down to his office. \"Let\u0027s go talk.\"\n \"Okay,\" I said as I followed him.\n \"Bethy\u0027s already called me twice today. Wanting to know if I\u0027d seen you yet. Making sure you got your job back,\" Woods said as he opened his office door and held it so that I could walk inside. \"What I didn\u0027t expect though was the call I just received about ten minutes ago. It surprised me. From the way you bolted out of here three weeks ago and left Rush all high and dry, I didn\u0027t expect him to call me on your behalf. Not that he needed to, mind you. I\u0027d already agreed that you could have your job back.\"\n I stopped and looked back at him. Had I just heard him correctly? \"Rush?\" I asked, almost afraid I\u0027d hallucinated that comment.\n Woods closed his door and walked over to stand in front of his desk. He leaned back against the expensive looking shiny wood and crossed his arms over his chest. The smile he\u0027d had when I arrived was gone. He looked more concerned now. \"Yes, Rush. I know that the truth came out. Jace has told me some of it. What he knows at least. But then I already knew who you were. Or who Rush and Nan thought you were. I warned you he\u0027d choose her. He was already choosing her when I gave you that warning. Do you really want to come back to all of this? Is Alabama that bad?\n No. Alabama wasn\u0027t that bad. Being a single pregnant nineteen year old with no family was bad though. That however was not something I was going to share with Woods. \"Coming back here isn\u0027t exactly easy. Seeing... them, won\u0027t be easy either. But I need to figure out what I\u0027m going to do. Where I\u0027m going to go. There is nothing left for me in Alabama. I can\u0027t stay there and pretend that there is. It\u0027s time I found a new life. And Bethy is the only friend I have. My options for places to go are a little limited.\"\n Woods eyebrows shot up. \"Ouch. What am I? Here I thought we were friends.\"\n Smiling, I walked over and stood behind the chair across from him. \"We are but well... not close friends.\"\n \"Not because I didn\u0027t try my damnedest.\"\n A small laugh bubbled up and Woods grinned. \"That\u0027s nice to hear. I missed it.\"\n Maybe coming back wouldn\u0027t be so hard.\n \"You can have your job. It\u0027s yours. I\u0027ve had shit for cart girls and Jimmy is still sulking. He doesn\u0027t play well with the other servers. He misses you too.\"\n \"Thank you,\" I replied. \"I appreciate it. I want to be honest with you though. In four months, I intend to leave. I can\u0027t stay here forever. I\u0027ve...\"\n \"You have a life to get to. Yeah, I heard you. Rosemary isn\u0027t where you intend to put down your roots. I got it. For whatever length of time, you got the job.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/never-too-far-too-far-2/page-11.html","bookId":1994,"book":{"id":1994,"title":"Never Too Far (Too Far #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Never Too Far (Too Far, #2; Rosemary Beach, #2) \n He had held a secret that destroyed her world. \n Everything she had known was no longer true. \n Blaire couldn’t stop loving him but she knew she could never forgive him. \n Now, she was back home and learning to live again.
