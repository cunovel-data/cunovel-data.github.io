She hadn\u0027t opened her eyes. The monitors blinked and beeped telling me she was alive. Her still form on the bed with gauze wrapped around her head and needles in her arms made it feel as if she were gone. The last words I\u0027d said to her had been hard. They seemed cruel now. I\u0027d just wanted her to grow up. Now that might never happen.\n The rage I\u0027d felt when I arrived had been knocked out of me when I laid eyes on her. Just seeing her so broken and helpless was killing me. I couldn\u0027t eat or sleep. I just needed her to open her eyes. I needed to tell her I loved her and I was sorry. I\u0027d promised her that she\u0027d always have me. No matter what. Then I\u0027d jerked that away from her. Because she couldn\u0027t accept Blaire.\n My stomach knotted up thinking of how I\u0027d left Blaire. Her eyes had been wide and terrified. I\u0027d handled leaving her all wrong too but I\u0027d been terrified myself. I couldn\u0027t call her yet. Not while Nan was like this. I\u0027d already put Blaire before Nan and look where that got me. This time Nan needed to come first. If she knew I was sitting here waiting on her she\u0027d open her eyes. I knew she would.\n The door opened and Grant stepped in. His eyes went instantly to Nan. The pain that flashed in them didn\u0027t surprise me. Even though he acted like he didn\u0027t like her I knew he cared for Nan. She had been the needy little brat that was impossible not to love when we were growing up. Those kinds of bonds are impossible to break.\n \"I just spoke with Woods. Blaire is okay. She was locked out of the house last night but she stayed at Bethy\u0027s. I called Henrietta and she\u0027s unlocking the house for her.\" He spoke quietly as if he\u0027d wake Nan or disturb her by talking about Blaire.\n I\u0027d left her standing in the driveway late at night alone. Thank God she had a phone. The idea of her being stranded in the dark was more than I could handle right now. \"Is she upset?\" What I really wanted to ask was if she was upset with me. How could she not be upset with me? I\u0027d run out on her after screaming for her to get out of my car. When mom had told me about Nan something in me had switched and I\u0027d lost it.\n \"He said he was going to look after her...\" Grant trailed off. I knew what he was thinking. Leaving Woods to look after Blaire was dangerous. He was rich, successful and his family didn\u0027t hate her. What if she realized I was a waste of her time?\n \"She\u0027s pregnant,\" I told him. I had to tell someone.\n \"Oh hell,\" he muttered and sank down onto the hard plastic chair that sat in the corner of the room. \"When did you find out?\"\n \"She told me shortly after she came back.\"\n Grant covered his mouth and shook his head. That hadn\u0027t been something he\u0027d expected to hear. But then he didn\u0027t know we were engaged either. He\u0027d left Rosemary already when I\u0027d proposed. I hadn\u0027t told him.\n \"That\u0027s why you proposed?\" it wasn\u0027t really a question. It was more of a statement.\n \"How\u0027d you know about that?\"\n He shifted his eyes to Nan, \"Nan told me.\"\n Nan had needed to vent I was sure. The fact she had chosen Grant to vent to was interesting. Normally those two were at each other\u0027s throats. Rarely did they spend quality time together.\n \"She wasn\u0027t happy about it,\" I said.\n \"No, she wasn\u0027t,\" he agreed.\n I looked over at her and wished to God I could trade places with her right now. I hated that she needed me and this was something I couldn\u0027t fix for her. I\u0027d been fixing her problems her entire life. And now when she needed me most all I could do was sit here and stare at her helplessly.\n \"She thinks you\u0027ve lost your mind. If she knew about the baby she\u0027d think you asked Blaire just because of the baby.\"\n \"I didn\u0027t ask her because of the baby. I asked her because I can\u0027t live without her. I just need Nan to understand that. I\u0027ve spent my life making Nan happy. Trying my damnedest to fix her problems. I was mother and father to her. And now that I have found what makes me happy she can\u0027t accept it.\" I felt my throat close up and I shook my head. I was not going to cry. \"I just wanted her to accept that Blaire made me happy.\"\n Grant let out a deep sigh. \"I think in time she will. Nan wants you happy too. She just thinks she knows what is best for you. Just like you think you know what is best for her.\" The tone in his voice as he said that last part was off. He\u0027d meant something deeper than what he was saying. Or I was just exhausted and I needed to take a nap.\n \"I hope so,\" I replied, then laid my head back on the chair and closed my eyes. \"I need a nap. I can\u0027t keep this up. My head is getting fuzzy.\"\n The chair he\u0027d been sitting in scraped across the floor as he stood up. I listened as he walked across the room back toward the door. \"Check in on Blaire for me. Please,\" I asked, opening my eyes to make sure he was still there and heard me.\n \"I will,\" he assured me then walked out the door.\n Two days later and still no sign of improvement. Nan wasn\u0027t waking up. I had gotten up to take a shower and change because my mother insisted. I couldn\u0027t deal with her and worry about Nan. I just did as she asked to shut her up.\n Today Grant had sat in here with me most of the day. We hadn\u0027t talked much but having someone else here helped. My mother said she couldn\u0027t handle it and stayed at the hotel most of the time. Occasionally Abe would step in to check on her but I didn\u0027t expect any more from him. He never checked on the daughter he\u0027d raised either. The man was missing a vital organ, a heart.\n \"I talked to Blaire today,\" Grant said, breaking the silence. Just hearing her name made me ache. I missed her. I wanted her here but that would only upset everyone. I needed Nan better. When she woke up she didn\u0027t need to know Blaire was here. It would only upset her.\n \"What did she sound like?\" Did she hate me?\n \"Good. I guess. Maybe sad. She\u0027s worried about you and Nan. She asks about Nan before she asks about you. She also... she also asked if her father was okay today. Not sure why she cares but she did.\"\n Because Blaire cared more than she should about everyone. Me included. She was too good for me and I was only going to keep hurting her. My family wouldn\u0027t accept her. The father that deserted her and her mother was now married to my mom. I\u0027d started that whole ball rolling with the damn picture. All I would ever do is hurt her in the long run.\n \"She has a doctor\u0027s appointment today. Woods told me he\u0027s taking her. She doesn\u0027t know I know about the baby.\"\n Another doctor\u0027s appointment I was going to miss. How much longer was she going to put up with this? I\u0027d told her she and our baby came first but this was the second time my family came before her doctor\u0027s appointment. And why the hell was Woods taking her?\n \"Why is Woods taking her? I have three vehicles in the garage.\"\n Grant shot me an annoyed frown. \"Yeah, you do. But you never gave her permission to drive one and never told her where she could find the keys so she won\u0027t touch them. Woods has been her chauffer all damn week.\"\n Fuck.\n \"I know you\u0027re hurting because of Nan. She\u0027s like your child. You\u0027re the only real parent she\u0027s ever had. But if you don\u0027t snap out of this and contact Blaire I\u0027m not sure she and your baby are going to be around when you decide to go home. Sure don\u0027t want my niece or nephew having the last name Kerrington,\" he snapped and stalked out of the room. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/never-too-far-too-far-2/page-38.html","bookId":1994,"book":{"id":1994,"title":"Never Too Far (Too Far #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Never Too Far (Too Far, #2; Rosemary Beach, #2) \n He had held a secret that destroyed her world. \n Everything she had known was no longer true. \n Blaire couldn’t stop loving him but she knew she could never forgive him. \n Now, she was back home and learning to live again.
