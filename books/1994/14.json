{"id":74595,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"Rush Blaire came walking out of Bethy\u0027s apartment holding two cups of coffee before I could get out of the car. I opened my door and stepped out of the Range Rover. Her hair was loose and hanging down her back. I loved it like that. The shorts she had on barely covered up her legs and were going to make it hard to concentrate once she was sitting in my car. They would ride up her thighs. I tore my eyes off her legs and met her steady gaze. She was forcing a small smile. \"I brought you some coffee since you got out of bed so early for me. I know early isn\u0027t your thing.\" Her voice was unsure and soft as she spoke. It was going to be my mission to change that on this road trip. I wanted her comfortable with me again. \"Thank you,\" I replied with a smile I hoped eased her nerves as I opened the passenger side door for her. I\u0027d been unable to sleepsince three this morning. I was anxious. I was pretty sure I had gone through two pots of coffee since then. I wasn\u0027t about to tell her that though. She\u0027d brought me coffee. A real smile tugged on my lips as I closed her door and headed back to my side. She was holding her cup up close to her mouth taking small sips when I glanced over at her. \"If you want music, I promised it was all yours,\" I reminded her. She didn\u0027t move but a smile lifted the corners of her lips. \"Thanks. Trust me, I remember. I\u0027m okay right now. You can listen to something if you want to. I need to wake up first.\" I didn\u0027t care about the radio. I just wanted to talk to her. What we talked about wasn\u0027t important. Talking to her was all I cared about. \"So, what\u0027s the plan? Does Cain know we\u0027re coming to get your things?\" I asked. She shifted in her seat and I forced myself to keep my eyes on the road and not her legs. \"No. I wanted to explain to him and his grandmother, Granny Q, about this. I also need to convince him to sell my truck for me and send me the money. It won\u0027t make it back out here again. It\u0027s in bad shape.\" Her truck was old. The idea that she wouldn\u0027t be riding around in it was a relief. However, I wasn\u0027t crazy about her not having a vehicle. How the hell I was supposed to fix that I didn\u0027t know. She would never take a car from me. Maybe her truck could be fixed and made safe. \"I could take it in and have it checked out while you\u0027re packing up. Could be it just needs a couple things done to it.\" She sighed. \"Thanks but don\u0027t bother. Cain already took it in and had it checked. He had them fix it up so I could get around town but he said it was a temporary fix. It needs more work than I can afford.\" I gripped the steering wheel tighter. The idea that Cain had been taking care of her drove me insane. I hated that he\u0027d been the one to have her truck checked out. That it was his family that helped her when she needed it most. Mine had fucked her life up. I wasn\u0027t there for her to call when she needed help. \"So are you and Cain...?\" What the hell was I asking? Were they what? Fuck. I didn\u0027t want to hear this. \"We are friends, Rush. We have been all our life. My feelings about him haven\u0027t changed.\" I eased my grip on the steering wheel and ran one of my sweaty palms on my jeans. Damn, she drove me crazy. If I was going to ease her back into being comfortable with me I needed to calm down. That was going to start with me not beating the shit outta Cain when I saw him. Before I could say anything else Blaire leaned forward and turned on the radio. She found a country station on my satellite radio and then leaned back in her seat and closed her eyes. I had pried too much. She was politely asking me to shut up. I could take the hint. Thirty minutes of silence passed before my phone rang. Nan\u0027s name appeared on the screen in my dash. Damn iPhone was programmed to my car. Normally that came in handy and made things hands free. But having Blaire see Nan\u0027s name wasn\u0027t cool. I hadn\u0027t wanted a reminder. My plan was to make this day reminder free. I clicked ignore and the radio started playing again. I didn\u0027t look over at Blaire but I felt her eyes on me. It was real hard not to meet her gaze. \"You could have talked to her. She\u0027s your sister,\" Blaire said so softly I almost missed it over the music. \"She is. But she represents things I don\u0027t want you thinking about today.\" Blaire didn\u0027t stop looking at me. It was taking all my strength to keep this casual. Jerking the car over and grabbing her face and telling her how important she was and how much I loved her wasn\u0027t what she needed right now. \"I\u0027m better, Rush. I\u0027ve had time to take everything in. Deal with it. I\u0027ll see Nan at the club. I\u0027m prepared for that. You\u0027re helping me today. You could be doing anything else but you chose to take the day to help me. I don\u0027t want to keep you from taking phone calls from people you care about. I won\u0027t break.\" Fuck. So much for keeping this casual and easy. I pulled over onto the side of the road and slammed the Rover into park. I kept my hands to myself but I gave my full attention to Blaire. \"I chose to take you today because there is nothing I\u0027d rather do than be near you. I\u0027m driving you because I\u0027m a desperate man who will take whatever the hell he can get when it comes to you.\" I broke down and reached over to run my thumb over her cheekbone then into the silky hair I\u0027d been fascinated with since I\u0027d first laid eyes on her. \"I will do anything. Anything, Blaire, just to be near you. I can\u0027t think about anything else. I can\u0027t focus on anything. So never think you\u0027re inconveniencing me. You need me, I\u0027m there.\" I stopped. I sounded pathetic even to my own ears. Dropping my hand from her head I shifted the Rover into gear and pulled back onto the road. Blaire didn\u0027t say anything. I didn\u0027t blame her. I\u0027d sounded like a crazy man. She was probably scared of me now. Hell, I would be.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/never-too-far-too-far-2/page-14.html","bookId":1994,"book":{"id":1994,"title":"Never Too Far (Too Far #2)","description":"Storyline: Never Too Far (Too Far, #2; Rosemary Beach, #2) He had held a secret that destroyed her world.
