Cain had checked it out for me last week after it broke down and said he could temporarily fix it. The cost to fix everything that was wrong with it would cost more than I could afford to spend. Calling and asking Granny Q or Cain to ship my things and sell my truck seemed wrong. They deserved an explanation... or at least Granny Q did. She\u0027d given me a roof, a bed and fed me for three weeks. I was going to have to go back to Sumit to get my stuff and say goodbye to Granny Q. Woods had given me a few days to get settled in before I started back to work.\\n\\n Bethy had taken off yesterday to take me to apply for Medicaid. It was time I saw a doctor but I would require insurance first. Today I had overheard her tell Jace she looked forward to their date tonight. I\u0027d been monopolizing all her time since she came and got me. I was beginning to feel like a lot of work. I hated that feeling. I could take a bus. It would be affordable and I wouldn\u0027t be a burden on Bethy. I opened Bethy\u0027s laptop to google the bus schedule.\\n\\n A knock on the door interrupted my thoughts. I stopped my search for a bus station and went to open the door. Rush standing there with his hands tucked into the front of his jeans and one of his tight tee shirts on was not what I\u0027d been expecting. He reached up and pulled off his aviator sunglasses. I wished he\u0027d kept them on. The silver color of his eyes in the sunshine was even more breathtaking than I remembered.\\n\\n \"Hey, I saw Bethy at the clubhouse. She said you were here,\" Rush explained. He was nervous. I\u0027d never seen Rush nervous.\\n\\n \"Yeah... um Woods gave me a couple of days to get my things from Sumit before I start back to work.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve got to go get your things?\"\\n\\n I nodded. \"Yeah. I left them there. I just brought an overnight bag with me. I hadn\u0027t exactly been planning on staying.\"\\n\\n Rush frowned. \"So how are you going to get there? I don\u0027t see your truck.\"\\n\\n \"I was just about to google bus stations and see where the closest one to here is.\"\\n\\n Rush\u0027s frown deepened. \"It\u0027s forty minutes away. All the way in Fort Walton Beach.\"\\n\\n That wasn\u0027t as bad as I\u0027d feared.\\n\\n \"A bus isn\u0027t safe Blaire. I don\u0027t like the idea of you taking a bus. Let me take you. Please. I\u0027ll get you there faster and I it\u0027s free. You could save your money.\"\\n\\n Ride with him? All the way to Sumit and back? Was that a good idea?\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know...\" I trailed off because honestly I didn\u0027t know. My heart wasn\u0027t ready for that much Rush.\\n\\n \"We don\u0027t even have to talk... or we can if you want. I\u0027ll let you choose the music and I won\u0027t complain.\"\\n\\n If I went back with Rush, then Cain wouldn\u0027t put up a fight. Or then again maybe he would. He could tell Rush about the pregnancy. But would he? I\u0027d never confirmed to Cain that I was pregnant.\\n\\n \"I know you can\u0027t forgive the lies and the hurt. I\u0027m not asking you to. You know I\u0027m sorry and if I could go back and change things I would. Please, Blaire, just as a friend who wants to help and keep you safe from crazy men who could hurt you on a bus, let me drive you.\"\\n\\n I thought of how very unlikely it was that I\u0027d get hurt on the bus. And then I thought about the fact I wasn\u0027t just keeping myself safe anymore. I had another life inside of me to protect.\\n\\n \"Okay. Yes. I\u0027d like a ride.\"\\n\\n Jace was sprawled out in the large stuffed blue chair that sat in Bethy\u0027s living room with his feet propped up on the ottoman and Bethy curled up in his lap. I was on the sofa feeling like a science experiment as they both stared at me in confusion.\\n\\n \"So you\u0027re fine with Rush taking you to Sumit tomorrow to get your things? I mean you don\u0027t feel weird or...\" Bethy trailed off.\\n\\n It would be strange. It would also hurt just being near him but I needed a ride. Bethy needed to work, not to take another day off to help me this week. \"He offered. I needed a ride so I said yes.\"\\n\\n \"And it was that easy? Why am I not buying it?\" Bethy asked.\\n\\n \"Because she\u0027s leaving out the parts where he begged and pleaded,\" Jace said with a chuckle.\\n\\n I pulled the afghan up over my shoulders. I was cold. I was cold a lot lately which was odd because it was summertime in Florida. \"He didn\u0027t beg,\" I replied, feeling an urge to defend Rush. Even if he did actually beg, it wasn\u0027t Jace\u0027s business.\\n\\n \"Yeah, right. If you say so.\" Jace took a drink of the sweet tea Bethy had fixed him.\\n\\n \"It isn\u0027t our business. Leave her alone, Jace. We need to decide on what to do about the lease on this place ending in a week.\"\\n\\n I wouldn\u0027t be here long. I\u0027d told her that. Moving into the more expensive condo wasn\u0027t a good idea. My half of the rent wouldn\u0027t be covered after I left and she\u0027d be left with all of it.\\n\\n Jacekissed Bethy\u0027s hand and grinned at her. \"I told you I\u0027d take care of things. If you\u0027d just let me.\" He winked at her and I turned my head away. I didn\u0027t want to watch them. Rush and I had never been like that. Our relationship had been short. Intense and brief. I wondered what it would have felt like to have the freedom to curl up in Rush\u0027s arms anytime I wanted. To know I was safe and that he loved me. We\u0027d never had that chance.\\n\\n \"And I told you I\u0027m not going to let you pay my rent. Sorry. New plan. Oh, Blaire, why don\u0027t we go apartment hunting tomorrow?\"\\n\\n A knock on the door interrupted me before I could agree. Then Grant opened the door and walked in.\\n\\n \"You did not just walk into my girl\u0027s apartment without permission. She could\u0027ve been naked,\" Jace snarled at Grant.\\n\\n Grant rolled his eyes then flashed a smile in my direction. \"I saw your car here, jackass. Calm down. I\u0027m here to see if I can convince Blaire to take a walk with me.\"\\n\\n \"You trying to get your ass kicked?\" Jace asked\\n\\n Grant smirked and then shook his head before looking back at me. \"Come on Blaire, let\u0027s go take a walk and play catch up.\"\\n\\n Had Grant been in on the lie? Surely he had known about it. I couldn\u0027t tell him no. Even if he had known he had also been the first nice person I\u0027d met here. He\u0027d filled my tank up with gas. He\u0027d worried about me sleeping under the stairs. I nodded and stood up. \"These two need some alone time anyway,\" I replied, glancing back at Bethy. She was studying me closely. I gave her a reassuring smile and she appeared to relax.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t leave on our account. We need to decide on where we\u0027re gonna live in a week,\" Bethy said as I walked to the door.\\n\\n \"Y\u0027all can talk about that later, Beth Ann. Blaire\u0027s been gone for almost a month. You have to share,\" Grant replied, opening the door for me to walk outside.\\n\\n \"Rush is gonna go apeshit,\" Jace called out right before Grant closed the door muffling whatever it was Bethy had started to say.\\n\\n We walked down the stairs in silence. Once we were on the sidewalk I looked over at Grant. \"Did you just miss me or is there something you want to say to me?\" I asked.\\n\\n Grant grinned. \"I missed you. I\u0027ve had to put up with Rush\u0027s sulking ass. So trust me I missed the fuckin\u0027 hell outta you.\"\\n\\n I could tell by his teasing tone he had wanted to make a joke. But thinking about Rush being upset didn\u0027t make me smile. It just reminded me of everything. \"Sorry,\" I mumbled. I wasn\u0027t sure what else to say to that.\\n\\n \"Just glad you\u0027re back.\"\\n\\n I waited. I knew there was more he wanted to say. I could sense it. He was taking his time and I figured he was trying to decide exactly how to say whatever it was he wanted to say to me.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry about what happened. How it happened. And Nan. She can come off as the world\u0027s biggest spoiled bitch but she\u0027s had a screwed up childhood. It warped her or something. If you\u0027d lived with Georgianna as your mother you\u0027d understand. Rush was a boy so he didn\u0027t get it as bad. But Nan, damn, her world was fucked. It isn\u0027t an excuse for her, just an explanation.\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t respond. I had nothing to say to that. I didn\u0027t feel sympathy of any kind for Nan. Obviously the men in her life did. Must be nice.\\n\\n \"Regardless of all that, what she did was wrong. How it was kept from you was really screwed up. I\u0027m sorry I didn\u0027t say anything but honestly, I wasn\u0027t even aware you and Rush had anything going until that night at the club when he lost it over the snails. I\u0027d noticed he was attracted to you but so were most males in this town. I figured he was the one guy who wouldn\u0027t make a move on you because of his loyalty to Nan... and well, what you represented to the both of them.\" Grant stopped walking and I turned to look back at him.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve never seen him like this. Ever. It\u0027s like he\u0027s hollow. I can\u0027t get through to him. He doesn\u0027t smile. He doesn\u0027t even pretend to enjoy life anymore. He\u0027s different since you left. Even though he wasn\u0027t honest and it looks like he was just protecting Nan... you two just didn\u0027t have enough time. Nan has been his responsibility since he was a kid. That was all he knew. Then you came into his world and apparently rocked it overnight. If he\u0027d had more time he would have told you. I know he would\u0027ve. But he didn\u0027t. It wasn\u0027t fair to him. He was falling for this girl he had always thought had been the reason his sister was without a dad. His belief system was changing but it was hard for him to work through it too.\"\\n\\n I just stared at him. Not because I didn\u0027t agree. I had already worked through all this in my head. I understood what he was saying. The problem was... it didn\u0027t change things. Even if he had been going to tell me, it didn\u0027t change who he was or who Nan was. What they represented to me. My mother\u0027s last three years on this earth had been hell while they lived in their fancy houses and flitted from one social event to the next. Their belief in the lies they told me was the one thing I didn\u0027t think I could ever get over.\\n\\n \"Damn. I\u0027m probably butchering this to shit. I just wanted to talk to you and make sure you knew that Rush... he needs you. He\u0027s sorry. And I don\u0027t think he\u0027s ever going to move on from you. If he tries to talk about it tomorrow at least hear him out.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve forgiven him, Grant. I just can\u0027t forget. What we were or what we were headed toward is over. It will never be again. I can\u0027t let it. My heart won\u0027t allow me to. But I\u0027ll always listen to him. I care about him.\"\\n\\n Grant let out a weary sigh. \"I guess that\u0027s better than nothing.\"\\n\\n It was all I had to offer. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/never-too-far-too-far-2/page-13.html","bookId":1994,"book":{"id":1994,"title":"Never Too Far (Too Far #2)","description":"Storyline: Never Too Far (Too Far, #2; Rosemary Beach, #2) \\n He had held a secret that destroyed her world. \\n Everything she had known was no longer true. \\n Blaire couldn’t stop loving him but she knew she could never forgive him. \\n Now, she was back home and learning to live again.
