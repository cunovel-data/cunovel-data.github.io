I had been upset earlier but I was fine now. He had been in an awful situation and Nan had been upset. I was sure Woods was pleased there hadn\u0027t been a big scene with me involved. \"Rush, I promise you that everything is fine. I\u0027m okay,\" I assured him, cupping his face in my hands. Dealing with Nan and her hatred was part of the deal. I got that and I was going to have to live with it if I wanted Rush in my life. He shook his head. \"Nothing about today was okay. I should have never agreed to have lunch with her there. I knew better. I should have never trusted her to be a normal person. I\u0027m so sorry, baby. I swear to you that will never happen again.\" I covered his mouth with mine and pushed him back on my bed. \"I told you it\u0027s okay. Stop apologizing,\" I whispered against his lips. Rush\u0027s hands slid up my shirt and found my bra that was now two sizes too small.Its strap was cutting into my skin after having to wear it all day. He unsnapped it then ran his hands over the skin that was marked from the pressure of the ill-fitting bra. \"You need a new bra,\" he said, brushing his fingers back and forth over my back making me shiver from pleasure. \"Mmmm if you promise to do that everynight I\u0027ll be fine,\" I assured him leaning down to kiss him again. He pulled back. \"Why didn\u0027t you tell me?\" he asked with a pained voice. Tell him what? I put my hands on either side of his head and lifted myself up to hover over him. \"What is it I was supposed to tell you?\" I asked, confused. Rush slipped his hands around my sides until they were sliding under my breasts and I forgot that we were having a conversation. That felt so good. Moaning, I pushed my chest into his hands and was getting ready to beg. \"Your skin is cut from this fucking bra, Blaire. Why did you wear it? I\u0027d have gotten you a new one. I\u0027m getting you a new one before you go anywhere else.\" He was still talking about my bra. \"Rush, I need you to touch me now. Don\u0027t worry about my bra. Just please...\" I bent my head down and took small nips at his shoulder and kissed my way down his chest. \"As good as that feels you can\u0027t distract me. I want to know why you didn\u0027t tell me your damn bra was hurting you. I don\u0027t want you hurting.\" I lifted my head and studied him. He was frowning. This really bothered him. No one ever worried about me like this. I wasn\u0027t used to it. My heart swelled and I reached down and pulled my shirt and bra off. \"Rush. I need a new bra. This one has gotten too small. Would you take me to get one? Please?\" I teased as his hands came up and cupped my swollen breasts making me cream in my panties even more. \"Tits as fucking perfect as these need to be taken care of. I can\u0027t stand the thought of them being in pain,\" he smirked up at me, \"unless of course I\u0027m the one causing the pain.\" He pinched both of my nipples hard and I cried out. \"Thesetitties are mine, Blaire. I take care of what is mine,\" he whispered before pulling a nipple into his mouth. I just nodded and rocked against him. His erection was pressing against my swollen clit and if I rubbed just a little bit longer I was going to come. I really needed to come. \"Easy girl. Let me get these shorts off you first,\" he said kissing down to my stomach where he lingered and kissed it sweetly. His eyes lifted to look at me as he slowly unfastened my shorts and began pulling them down my body. \"Looks like someone needs some attention. She\u0027s all swollen and wet. Dripping wet. Fuck that\u0027s hot,\" he murmured as he pushed my legs apart and gazed hungrily between my legs. He laid down between my legs until his mouth was so close to my clit I could feel his warm breath on it. \"Tonight I\u0027m staying here. I can\u0027t sleep at night knowing you might wake up like this and need me. The idea drives me crazy,\" his voice dropped to a husky sound that always excited me. I watched as he stuck out his tongue and the silver barbell flashed at me before he ran his tongue through the folds and then slipped it inside me. I grabbed his head and began pleading with him for more as he brought me to not one but two orgasms before he lifted his head and smiled wickedly at me. \"That\u0027s fucking addictive. No one should taste that sweet, Blaire. Not even you.\" He stood up and jerked off his shirt and pants.He was back on top of me before I could admire the view for very long. \"I want you to ride me,\" he said, kissing me again while his erection slipped between my legs and teased me. I pushed him back and he easily rolled over for me so I could climb on top. Watching him as he slowly took in my body was more of a turn on than the naughty words he always whispered in my ears to make me come. I could love this man and be happy with him the rest of my life. I just hoped I got the chance. The next few days went by like a fairy tale. I went to work. Rush showed up and distracted me with his gorgeous presence; we ended up somewhere we shouldn\u0027t be having wild sex before actually going back to my condo or his house and making love in a bed. The second time was always sweet. The first time was always intense and needy on both our parts. I was pretty sure Woods had overheard us the day we\u0027d ended up in the rental closet tearing at each other\u0027s clothes. I was still trying to decide if this was the pregnancy hormones or if I was always going to want Rush like this. One touch from him and I was desperate. Today however we would be on a break. I was working all day at the annual golf tournament. I\u0027d had to fight both Woods and Rush to let me work today. Neither of them had thought it was safe. I, of course, won. Our cart girl outfits were special ordered for today. We would be wearing all white like the golfers.Our shorts were replaced with skirts to match ourpolos. Except, of course, for Jimmy. He\u0027d be in shorts. He was the only male on the drink carts today. Apparently, he\u0027d also been special ordered. \"There are fifteen teams. Blaire you get the first threeteams. Then Bethy you have the next three. Carmen you get the next three. Natalie you get the next three and Jimmy you get the last three. They\u0027re all women who have requested you specifically. This will be an all day event. Keep the golfers happy and don\u0027t run low on drinks. Come back here to restock before you run out of something. Your carts have been pre-stocked with the drinks of choice for the golfers you will be trailing today. You each have a walkie-talkie in your cart to contact me in case of any emergency. Does anyone have any questions?\" Darla stood on the porch of the course offices with her hands on her hips staring down at the five of us. \"Good. Now get to your places. Blaire will be busy right off the bat. The rest of you need to wait on and check on your teams while they\u0027re waiting to tee off. If they want a drink get them one. If they want food, get them a server. Got it?\" We all nodded. Darla waved us off and went back into the offices. \"I hate tournaments. I just hope I don\u0027t have to deal with Nathan Ford. He is so damn annoying,\" Bethy grumbled as we went to get our carts and make sure we had everything before heading to the first hole. \"Maybe you\u0027ll get Jace,\" I said, hoping to cheer her up. Bethy frowned. \"Nope. Not a chance. Aunt Darla did the line up. She won\u0027t have given me Jace.\" Ah. Well, in that case I wouldn\u0027t have Rush either. Probably a good thing. I needed to focus on work. Not how good Rush looked in a pair of shorts and a polo. I parked the cart at the first hole and went to meet my first group. It was familiar faces and they were an older group. They would be easy enough and they were excellent tippers. After getting them all a bottle of water I went to my next group. Surprisingly it was Jace, Thad and Woods. I hadn\u0027t expected to have them in my group. \"Hello boys. Aren\u0027t I the lucky one?\" I teased. \"I was sure we\u0027d get Bethy. Dayum, my day is just now getting better,\" Thad replied. \"Shut up,\" Jace grumbled and elbowed him in the side. \"I\u0027m not stupid enough to let Bethy have Jace. She\u0027d ignore everyone else,\" Woods explained. I gave all three of them a bottle of water. \"I\u0027m happy to serve the three of you. Even if I\u0027m not Bethy,\" I said, smiling at Jace. \"If I can\u0027t have Bethy you are definitely my runner-up,\" Jace said with a crooked grin. I couldn\u0027t help but like the guy. He\u0027d more than proved himself with his feelings for Bethy. \"Good. Now, y\u0027all make me proud,\" I cheered as I headed to the next group. This was my first female group. I recognized them but I wasn\u0027t sure exactly who they were. I thought the tall elegant blondemight be the Mayor\u0027s wife. After I got them their sparkling waters and slices of lime I headed back to the front. It was almost time to start. I glanced back and looked for Rush but didn\u0027t see him. I wasn\u0027t sure whose team he was on but I knew he was playing. I assumed Grant would be with him but I didn\u0027t see him either.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/never-too-far-too-far-2/page-29.html","bookId":1994,"book":{"id":1994,"title":"Never Too Far (Too Far #2)","description":"Storyline: Never Too Far (Too Far, #2; Rosemary Beach, #2) He had held a secret that destroyed her world.
