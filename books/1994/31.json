My desire to see Rush had gotten the best of me and I\u0027d taken a small detour until I found him. Now, I wish I hadn\u0027t. For the first time this week I was sick at my stomach again. He hadn\u0027t told me Meg was his first. He\u0027d just said they were old friends.\n Knowing what kind of old friends they were didn\u0027t help. I was well aware that Rush had a string of girls that he\u0027d slept with. It was something I knew when I\u0027d gone to his bed the first time. But seeing him with the one. The one that had been his first was painful.\n She\u0027d been flirting with him and he\u0027d been flirting back. Trying to impress her with his muscles. They were impressive enough without him flexing them and showing off. Why had he done that? Did he want her to be attracted to him? Was he curious about what she was like in bed now?\n My stomach rolled and I forced my cart into drive and pulled away from the trees I\u0027d been hiding behind. I hadn\u0027t meant to hide. I\u0027d taken a short cut to see if Rush was at this hole. But when I\u0027d seen him smiling at Meg and then letting her touch him I\u0027d stopped. I couldn\u0027t go any further.\n She was a part of his world. She fit into his world. Instead of driving a drink cart around she was playing golf with him. He couldn\u0027t have asked me. For starters I had no idea how to play and then, of course, I worked here. I couldn\u0027t play. What was he doing with me? His sister hated me. I couldn\u0027t be a part of his life. Not really. I would always be on the outside looking in. I hated the way this felt.\n Being with him was amazing. In the privacy of his house or my condo it was easy to pretend we could be something more. But what happens when I\u0027m showing? When I\u0027m very pregnant and he is with me? People will know. How will he handle it? Can I expect him to?\n I loaded the cart back up and let my mind play over all the scenarios that could happen with us. None of them ended happily. I wasn\u0027t one of the elite. I was just me. This past week I\u0027d let myself play with the idea of staying. Raising this baby with Rush. As much as seeing him with Meg had hurt it had been the wakeup call I needed. No one lived in a fairy tale. Especially me.\n By the time I got back my group had made it to the last stretch. I smiled and served drinks and even joked with the golfers. No one was going to know I was upset. This was my job. I was going to be good at it.\n I wouldn\u0027t say anything to Rush tonight. There was no point. He wasn\u0027t thinking clearly. I would just put some distance between us. I couldn\u0027t let myself believe he was my happily ever after. I was smarter than that.\n I hadn\u0027t been able to make it through the day without getting sick. The heat had gotten to me but I would be damned if Woods knew about it. I didn\u0027t need him thinking I couldn\u0027t do my job. Bethy held my hair back while I threw up in the toilet in the back of the offices. I really did love her.\n \"You over did it,\" she scolded as I lifted my head up from my last heave.\n I didn\u0027t want to admit it but she was probably right. I took the wet washcloth she was handing me and cleaned my face before sitting down on the floor and leaning back against the wall.\n \"I know. But don\u0027t tell anyone,\" I requested.\n Bethy sat down beside me. \"Why?\"\n \"Because I need this job. The money is good. If I\u0027m leaving once I start showing then I need all the money I can save up. It won\u0027t be easy getting a job while I\u0027m obviously pregnant.\"\n Bethy turned her head and looked at me. \"You\u0027re still planning on leaving? What about Rush?\"\n I didn\u0027t want Bethy mad at him. She\u0027d just started being nice to him again. \"I saw him today. He was having fun. He fit in. He\u0027s where he belongs. I\u0027m where I belong. I don\u0027t fit in with his world.\"\n \"He doesn\u0027t get a say in this? If you just said the word he\u0027d have you moved into his house and he would be taking care of everything. You wouldn\u0027t be working at this club and you would be at his side everywhere. You\u0027ve got to know that.\"\n I didn\u0027t like the idea of being one more woman who mooched off him. His mother and sister did that. I didn\u0027t want to do it too. I didn\u0027t care about his money. I just cared about him. \"I\u0027m not his responsibility.\"\n \"Excuse me if I beg to differ. When he knocked you up you became his ultimate responsibility,\" Bethy said in a huff.\n I knew the truth about the night we\u0027d had sex without a condom. I\u0027d come onto him. I had all but attacked him. It hadn\u0027t been his fault. All the other times he was careful. I hadn\u0027t let him be that night. It was my mistake not his.\n \"Trust me when I tell you that this was all on me. You weren\u0027t there the night I got pregnant. I was.\"\n \"Can\u0027t be all your fault. You can\u0027t get pregnant alone.\"\n I wasn\u0027t going to argue with her. \"Just don\u0027t tell anyone I was sick. I don\u0027t want them worrying.\"\n \"Fine. I\u0027m not happy about it though. You do this again and I\u0027m telling,\" she warned.\n I laid my head over on her shoulder. \"Deal,\" I agreed.\n Bethy patted my head. \"You are one crazy girl.\"\n I just laughed because she was right. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/never-too-far-too-far-2/page-31.html","bookId":1994,"book":{"id":1994,"title":"Never Too Far (Too Far #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Never Too Far (Too Far, #2; Rosemary Beach, #2) \n He had held a secret that destroyed her world. \n Everything she had known was no longer true. \n Blaire couldn’t stop loving him but she knew she could never forgive him. \n Now, she was back home and learning to live again.
