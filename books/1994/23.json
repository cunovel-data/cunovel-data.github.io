I\u0027d even had Bethy cook bacon to test me out before I came in for the lunch shift. I figured if I could survive the bacon then I could do this. My stomach had rolled and I\u0027d gotten nauseous but I hadn\u0027t thrown up. I was getting better.\\n\\n I called Woods and assured him I would be fine. He told me to come on in because they were short staffed and he needed me. Jimmy was standing in the kitchen grinning when I walked in thirty minutes before the lunch shift.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s my girl. Glad that stomach virus has gone. You look like you lost ten pounds. How long were you sick?\" Woods had told Jimmy and anyone else who asked that I had a virus and I was recovering. I\u0027d only worked two shifts on the course and I never ran into kitchen staff while on the carts.\\n\\n \"I probably did lose some weight. I\u0027m sure I\u0027ll gain it back soon enough,\" I replied and hugged him.\\n\\n \"You better or I\u0027m shoving donuts down your throat until I can wrap my hands around your waist and have my fingers not touch.\"\\n\\n That may be sooner than he realized. \"I could use a good donut right now.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a date. After work. You, me, and a twelve pack. Half chocolate covered,\" Jimmy said and handed me my apron.\\n\\n \"Sounds good. You can come see my new place. I\u0027m staying with Bethy in a condo on the club property.\"\\n\\n Jimmy\u0027s eyebrows shot up. \"You don\u0027t say. Well, well, well aren\u0027t you highfalutin\u0027?\"\\n\\n I tied my apron on and tucked my pen and pad in my front pocket. \"I\u0027ll take the first round if you prep the salads and make the sweet tea.\"\\n\\n Jimmy winked. \"Deal.\"\\n\\n I headed out to the dining room and luckily the only guests were two older gentlemen I\u0027d seen before but I didn\u0027t know their names. I took down their orders and poured them both a cup of coffee before heading back to check on the salads.\\n\\n Jimmy had two already made for me and was holding them up when I walked back into the kitchen. \"Here ya go hot stuff,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Thanks gorgeous,\" I replied taking the salads into the dining room. I delivered the salads and took the drink order of new guests. Then I headed back to get their sparkling water and spring water with lemon. No one ever just ordered water around here.\\n\\n Jimmy was heading out the kitchen door when I got there. \"I just got the two women who look like they came off the tennis courts. I think I saw Hillary... isn\u0027t that the hostess today? Anyway I think I saw her talking to more guests so there should be a table waiting to be greeted.\"\\n\\n He saluted me and headed back to the dining room.\\n\\n I quickly finished getting the special waters and put the two orders of crab bisque the men had requested onto my tray thenreturned to the dining room when Jimmy\u0027s panicked expression caught my attention.\\n\\n \"I got this,\" he said, reaching for my tray.\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t even know where it goes. I can carry a tray Jimmy,\" I replied rolling my eyes. He didn\u0027t even know I was pregnant and he was being silly...\\n\\n Then I saw him... or them. Jimmy wasn\u0027t being silly. He was protecting me. Rush\u0027s head was tilted forward as he talked about something that caused that intense serious expression on his face. The woman had long dark hair. She was gorgeous. Her cheekbones were high and perfect. Long heavy lashes outlined her dark eyes. I was going to be sick. My tray rattled and Jimmy was taking it from me. I let him. I was about to drop it.\\n\\n He wasn\u0027t mine. But... I was carrying his baby. He didn\u0027t know. But... he\u0027d made love to me, no he\u0027d fucked me, in Bethy\u0027s bathroom just three days ago. This hurt. So bad. I swallowed but my throat felt almost closed. Jimmy was saying something to me but I couldn\u0027t understand him. I was unable to do anything but stare at them. He leaned in so close to her like he didn\u0027t want anyone to hear what he was saying.\\n\\n Her eyes shifted from Rush\u0027s and they met mine. I hated her. She was beautiful and refined and everything I wasn\u0027t. She was a woman. I was a girl. A pathetic girl. Who needed to get the hell out of here and stop making a scene. Even if it was a silent scene, I was still just standing frozen staring at them. She studied me and a small frown creased her forehead. I didn\u0027t want her asking Rush about me and pointing me out. I spun around and fled the dining room.\\n\\n As soon as I was out of the guests\u0027 view, I broke into a run and ran right into Woods\u0027 hard chest. \"Whoa there sweetheart. Where are you running off to? Still too much for you?\" he asked sticking his finger under my chin and tilting my head up so he could see my face.\\n\\n I shook my head and a tear escaped. I was not going to cry about this, dammit. I\u0027d asked for it. I\u0027d pushed him away. I\u0027d walked out on him after the amazing sex. What did I expect? That he\u0027d sit around pining for me? Hardly. \"I\u0027m sorry, Woods. Just give me a minute and I\u0027ll be fine. I promise you. I just need a moment to get myself together.\"\\n\\n He nodded and ran a hand up and down my arm in a comforting way. \"Is Rush in there?\" he asked almost hesitantly.\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" I choked out, forcing the tears filling my eyes to go away. I took a deep breath and blinked them away. I wasn\u0027t going to do this. I was going to control my crazy emotions.\\n\\n \"Is he with someone?\" Woods asked.\\n\\n I just nodded. I didn\u0027t want to say it.\\n\\n \"You want to go to my office and chill out a bit? Wait until they\u0027re gone?\"\\n\\n Yes. I wanted to go hide from this but I couldn\u0027t. I had to learn to live with it. Rush would be in Rosemary for another month. I had to learn to deal. \"I can do this. It was just a surprise. That\u0027s all.\"\\n\\n Woods lifted his gaze from mine and a cold expression came over his face. \"Go away. This is not what she needs right now,\" Woods said in a hard angry tone.\\n\\n \"Get your mother fucking hands off her,\" Rush replied.\\n\\n I stepped back from Woods\u0027 embrace and kept my eyes down. I didn\u0027t want to see him but I also didn\u0027t want him and Woods fighting either. Woods looked ready to fight for my honor. I had no idea how Rush looked because I wasn\u0027t going to check and see.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m fine Woods. Thank you. I\u0027ll get back to work,\" I mumbled and started to head back to the kitchen.\\n\\n \"Blaire, don\u0027t. Talk to me,\" Rush pleaded.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve done enough. Leave her the hell alone, Rush. She doesn\u0027t need this from you. Not now,\" Woods barked.\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t know anything,\" Rush growled and Woods took a step in Rush\u0027s direction. Woods was either going to blurt out that I was pregnant and make it very obvious that he did know something or he was going to start throwing punches with Rush. It was once again time for me to get over this and fix it.\\n\\n I turned back and went to stand in front of Rush. I looked up at Woods. \"It\u0027s okay. Just give me a minute with him. It\u0027ll be okay. He didn\u0027t do anything wrong. I was just being emotional. That\u0027s all,\" I told him.\\n\\n Woods\u0027 jaw worked back and forth as he ground his teeth. Keeping his mouth shut was proving difficult for him. He finally nodded and stalked away.\\n\\n I had to face Rush now.\\n\\n \"Blaire,\" Rush said gently as his hand reached out and grabbed mine. \"Please look at me.\"\\n\\n I could do this. I had to do this. I turned around letting Rush continue holding my hand in his. I should remove it but I couldn\u0027t just yet. I\u0027d seen him with a woman who was probably keeping his bed warm at night while I continued to push him away. I was losing him. So was our baby. But then... had we ever really had him?\\n\\n I lifted my eyes and met his worried gaze. He didn\u0027t like upsetting me. I loved that about him. \"It\u0027s okay. I overreacted. I was just, um, surprised is all. I should have known you\u0027d have moved on by now. I just - \"\\n\\n \"Stop it,\" Rush interrupted me and pulled me up against him. \"I haven\u0027t moved anywhere. What you think you saw you didn\u0027t. Meg is an old friend. That is all. She means nothing to me. I came looking for you. I needed to see you and I went to play golf. You weren\u0027t there. I ran into Meg and she suggested we have lunch. That\u0027s it. I had no idea you were in here working. I\u0027d have never done that. Even though I wasn\u0027t doing anything. I love you Blaire. Just you. I\u0027m not with anyone else. I never will be.\"\\n\\n I wanted to believe him. As selfish and wrong as it was I wanted to believe he loved me enough not to need anyone else. Even if I was pushing him away from me. I was lying to him. I hated liars. He would hate me too if I didn\u0027t tell him soon. I didn\u0027t want him to hate me. But I couldn\u0027t trust him. Did lying make that okay? Was lying ever okay? How could he ever trust me?\\n\\n \"I\u0027m pregnant.\" The words came out of me before I realized what I was doing. I covered my mouth in horror as Rush\u0027s eyes went wide. Then I turned and ran like hell. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/never-too-far-too-far-2/page-23.html","bookId":1994,"book":{"id":1994,"title":"Never Too Far (Too Far #2)","description":"Storyline: Never Too Far (Too Far, #2; Rosemary Beach, #2) \\n He had held a secret that destroyed her world. \\n Everything she had known was no longer true. \\n Blaire couldn’t stop loving him but she knew she could never forgive him. \\n Now, she was back home and learning to live again.
