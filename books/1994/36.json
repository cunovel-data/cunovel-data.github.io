She\u0027d agreed to everything I asked. I wasn\u0027t about to push my luck. I sat at the table with my laptop and a cup of coffee waiting on her to get off her shift.\\n\\n Woods had stopped by to talk to me for a few minutes but other than that it had been a quiet evening. Most everyone had left town. Jace was hanging around because of Bethy but I wasn\u0027t sure he was going to make it much longer. I\u0027d seen the restless look in his eyes the other day when we\u0027d played a round of golf. He wasn\u0027t used to staying in this town longer than a summer.\\n\\n \"This seat taken?\" I looked up to see Meg take the seat across from me. I hadn\u0027t seen her much since the golf tournament. I glanced back to see Blaire refilling someone\u0027s water but her eyes were on me.\\n\\n \"Yeah, it is,\" I replied without looking back at Meg.\\n\\n \"I know you\u0027re engaged to the blonde. Everyone knows it. I\u0027m not here to hit on you,\" she replied.\\n\\n Blaire smiled at me and then turned to walk back to the kitchen. Shit. What did that smile mean?\\n\\n \"She has a big ass diamond on her hand. She has nothing to be worried about and she knows it. Calm down, dude. You\u0027re freaking out over nothing.\"\\n\\n I shifted my attention to Meg. \"She knows you were my first. It bothers her.\"\\n\\n Meg chuckled. \"I can assure you the memories I have from our experience and the reality she is living in are completely different. I got the horny virgin. She has the seasoned pro.\"\\n\\n I glanced back to see if Blaire was back out here. I didn\u0027t want her hearing this. \"Just go sit somewhere else. She\u0027s emotional right now. I don\u0027t want her upset.\"\\n\\n No one knew she was pregnant yet. I was letting Blaire decide when to tell people.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s not made of china. She will not break. Does she know you treat her like a damn doll?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, I do. We\u0027re working on that,\" Blaire replied as she approached our table and poured more coffee into my cup. \"I don\u0027t believe we have officially been introduced. I\u0027m Blaire Wynn.\"\\n\\n Meg took a quick startled peek at me then turned back to Blaire. \"Meg Carter.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s nice to finally meet you, Meg. Can I get you something to drink?\"\\n\\n This was not what I\u0027d been expecting. Not that I didn\u0027t like it, because I did. It meant I was making her feel more secure with me.\\n\\n \"If I ask for a Diet Coke is he going to take a swing at me?\" Meg asked.\\n\\n Blaire laughed and shook her head. \"No. He\u0027ll be a good boy. I promise.\" Then she looked down at me. \"You hungry?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m good,\" I assured her.\\n\\n She nodded and headed back to the kitchen.\\n\\n \"I might just be in love with her a little bit. She\u0027s smoking hot. But then if someone is going to tie you down they\u0027d have to be a complete package.\"\\n\\n Smiling I took a sip of my coffee. Then looked back at the doorway waiting on Blaire to walk back through. I couldn\u0027t wait to get her sexy little ass home.\\n\\n Blaire kept leaning over the seat pressing kisses down my neck and nibbling my ear. It was real damn hard to stay focused on driving back to the house.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m about ready to pull over and fuck my horny little fiance if she doesn\u0027t stop,\" I warned taking a nip at her bottom lip when she kissed too close to my mouth.\\n\\n \"That sounds like more of a promise than a threat,\" she teased, slipping her\\n\\n hand between my legs and cupping my erection.\\n\\n \"Fuck baby, you\u0027re driving me crazy,\" I growled, pressing into her hand.\\n\\n \"If I suck it can you concentrate enough to drive?\" she asked as she started\\n\\n unbuttoning my jeans.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll more than likely run us into a palm tree but I don\u0027t give a shit at the moment,\" I replied as her hand slipped down the front of my underwear.\\n\\n Luckily, we wouldn\u0027t have to find out. I pulled into the driveway and slammed the car in park just as Blaire got my pants unzipped. My phone went off for the third time. I\u0027d had it on vibrate and private so it wouldn\u0027t disturb us by flashing up on the screen. My mother had called me earlier while I\u0027d been waiting on Blaire and I wasn\u0027t in the mood to answer it. Once it stopped it started back again. Damn.\\n\\n I was going to have to either turn it off or deal with her. Blaire had my cock in her hands so I was thinking that off would work best. Glancing down I noticed an out of town number flashing across my screen. The area code was familiar but I couldn\u0027t place it.\\n\\n \"Who is it?\" Blaire asked.\\n\\n \"Not sure but they\u0027re determined.\"\\n\\n Blaire stopped touching me. \"Answer it. I\u0027ll be good for a few minutes.\"\\n\\n I pressed answer. I needed to get rid of them and get my girl inside. But before I could say hello my mother started talking and my world was jerked out from under my feet. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/never-too-far-too-far-2/page-36.html","bookId":1994,"book":{"id":1994,"title":"Never Too Far (Too Far #2)","description":"Storyline: Never Too Far (Too Far, #2; Rosemary Beach, #2) \\n He had held a secret that destroyed her world. \\n Everything she had known was no longer true. \\n Blaire couldn’t stop loving him but she knew she could never forgive him. \\n Now, she was back home and learning to live again.
