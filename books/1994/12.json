{"id":74593,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"Rush\n I knocked once before opening the door to Nan\u0027s condo and walking in. Her car was parked outside. I knew she was here. I just wanted to make sure she knew I was here. I\u0027d made the mistake once of not knocking and had seen my little sister straddling a guy\u0027s lap.I had wanted to pour bleach in my eyes and brain after that experience.\n \"Nan, it\u0027s me. We need to talk.\" I called out then closed the door behind me. I stepped into the living room and the sound of more than one hushed voice and footsteps coming from the master bedroom almost made me turn around and leave. But I wasn\u0027t going to. This was more important. Her sleepover guest needed to go on home now anyway. It was after eleven.\n Her bedroom door opened and closed. Interesting. Whoever was here was staying. We\u0027d need to step outside on the balcony to talk. I wasn\u0027t discussing Blaire in front of anyone else. I probably knew the guy in that room. It would be the only reason she would keep him hidden in there.\n \"Ever heard of calling before you come over?\" Nan snapped as she walked into the living room dressed in a short silk wrap. She looked more and more like our mother the older she got.\n \"It\u0027s almost lunch, Nan. You can\u0027t keep the man in bed all day,\" I replied and opened the doors that led out onto the balcony overlooking the gulf. \"I need to talk to you and I don\u0027t want to do it where your bedroom buddy can hear us.\"\n Nan rolled her eyes and stepped outside. \"I find it odd that I\u0027ve been trying to get you to talk to me for weeks and now that you want to talk you come barging over like I have no life. At least I call you first.\" She was starting to sound like our mother too.\n \"I own this condo, Nan. I can come in any damn time I want to,\" I reminded her. She would be leaving here in mid August to head back to her sorority house and her still undecided major. College was a social function for her. She knew I\u0027d pay her bills and tuition. I\u0027d always taken care of everything for her.\n \"Snarky much. What is this about? I haven\u0027t had my coffee yet.\" She also wasn\u0027t afraid of me. I didn\u0027t want her to be but it was time she grew up. I wasn\u0027t going to let her send Blaire running. In a month, Nan would be gone. Normally I would be too. Not this year. I\u0027d be keeping my residence at Rosemary. Mother would have to pick another location. She wasn\u0027t going to have this house free for the rest of the year.\n \"Blaire is back,\" I told her bluntly. I\u0027d had time to see things from another angle. I didn\u0027t feel like Nan was the victim in this any longer. As a child she was but then so was Blaire. Nan tensed as her eyes flashed with the hate that belonged at her father\u0027s feet instead of on Blaire. \"Don\u0027t say anything. Let me speak first or I\u0027ll go escort your sleepover friend from my condo. I hold the power here Nan. Our mother has nothing. I support you both. I\u0027ve never asked you for anything. Ever. But right now I\u0027m going to ask... no, I\u0027m going to demand you listen to me and you follow my terms.\"\n Nan\u0027s anger had faded and now the spoiled brat was there looking back at me. She didn\u0027t like being told what to do. I couldn\u0027t blame my mother for her behavior, not entirely. I did this too. Overcompensation had ruined Nan.\n \"I hate her,\" she seethed.\n \"I said to listen to me. Don\u0027t assume I\u0027m bluffing Nan. Because this time you\u0027ve fucked with something I care about. This affects me, so listen and shut the hell up.\"\n Her eyes went round from shock. I was sure I\u0027d never spoken to her that way. I was even a little surprised myself. Hearing the hate in her voice directed at Blaire had set me off.\n \"Blaire is staying with Bethy. Woods has given Blaire her job back. She has nothing in Alabama. She has no one. The father the two of you share is worthless. To her he might as well be dead. She\u0027s back to find out where she fits and what to do next. She was doing that before but when the truth came out it sent her world crumbling so she ran. It\u0027s a fucking miracle she\u0027s back here. I want her back here, Nan. You may not want to hear this but I love her. I will stop at nothing to make sure she\u0027s safe. She is secure and no one and I do mean no one, not even my sister, makes her feel unwanted. You leave soon. You can keep your misplaced hate if you want to but one day I hope you grow up enough to realize there is only one person to hate here.\"\n Nan sank down onto one of the lounge chairs she kept out here to lay out and read books. I loved her too. I\u0027d been protecting her all my life. Telling her this and threatening her was hard but I couldn\u0027t let her hurt Blaire any longer. I had to stop this. Blaire would never give me another chance as long as Nan was tormenting her life.\n \"So you\u0027re choosing her over me,\" Nan whispered.\n \"This isn\u0027t a contest Nan. Stop acting like it is. You\u0027ve got the dad. She lost him. You won. Now let it go.\"\n Nan lifted her eyes and tears were clinging to her eyelashes. \"She\u0027s made you hate me.\"\n Damn fucking drama. Nan lived a soap opera in her head. \"Nan, listen to me. I love you. You\u0027re my little sister. No one can change that. But I am in love with Blaire. It may be a major hitch in your plans to conquer and destroy but baby, it is time you let your daddy issues go. Three years ago he came back. I need you to put this behind you.\"\n \"What about family first?\" She choked out.\n \"Don\u0027t go there. You and I both know I\u0027ve put you first all my life. You needed me and I was there. But we are adults now, Nan.\"\n She wiped the tears that had leaked out of her eyes and stood back up. I could never tell if her tears were real or fake. She could turn them on and off at whim. \"Fine. Maybe I\u0027ll go back to school early. You don\u0027t want me here anyway. You\u0027ve chosen her.\"\n \"I\u0027ll always want you around, Nan. But this time I want you to play nice. Think about someone else for a change. You have a heart. I\u0027ve seen it. Now it is time to use it.\"\n Nan\u0027s spine stiffened. \"If we\u0027re done here could you please leave your condo?\"\n I nodded. \"Yeah I\u0027m done,\" I replied and walked back inside. Without another word I headed out the front door. Time would now tell if I had to follow through on my threats to teach my sister a lesson. I really hoped I didn\u0027t. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/never-too-far-too-far-2/page-12.html","bookId":1994,"book":{"id":1994,"title":"Never Too Far (Too Far #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Never Too Far (Too Far, #2; Rosemary Beach, #2) \n He had held a secret that destroyed her world. \n Everything she had known was no longer true. \n Blaire couldn’t stop loving him but she knew she could never forgive him. \n Now, she was back home and learning to live again.
