Was it a desperate hallucination? Was I getting that bad?\n \"If you aren\u0027t going after her I am.\" Woods\u0027 voice broke into my thoughts and I snapped out of my shocked haze.\n \"What?\" I asked, glaring at him. I hated him. Beating his face in was something I was suddenly fantasizing about.\n \"I said, if you aren\u0027t going after her I am. She needs someone right now. As much as I don\u0027t want it to be you because I don\u0027t think you deserve her it needs to be you.\"\n Did he know she was pregnant? My blood started to boil. Had she told Woods she was pregnant and hadn\u0027t told me?\n \"I was here the first morning she tried to work and the smell of bacon sent her scrambling to the restroom to vomit. So, yeah I already knew. Get that crazed possessive gleam out of your eyes and go get her.\" Woods\u0027 tone was laced with disgust.\n \"She\u0027s been sick?\" I hadn\u0027t known she was sick. My chest hurt. She\u0027d been sick alone. I\u0027d left her alone and she\u0027d been suffering. Air wasn\u0027t getting to my lungs.\n \"Yeah, you stupid shit, she\u0027s been sick. That happens in her situation. But she\u0027s getting better. Now I\u0027m about to turn and go after her. Make your move,\" Woods warned.\n I broke into a run.\n It wasn\u0027t until I exited the building in the back and looked up the hill that I found her. She was still running. It was toward the condos. She was going back to her place. I went after her. She was pregnant. Should she be running like this? What if it was bad for the baby? She needed to slow down.\n \"Blaire, stop. Wait,\" I called out when I was close enough. She slowed down and finally stopped as I caught up with her.\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" she sobbed with her face in her hands.\n \"What are you sorry for?\" I asked, closing the distance between us and pulling her against me. I wasn\u0027t worried about scaring her off anymore. I wasn\u0027t letting her go anywhere.\n \"This. Everything. My being pregnant,\" she whispered, stiff in my arms.\n She was sorry. No. She wasn\u0027t going to be sorry for that. \"You have nothing to be sorry for. Don\u0027t ever apologize to me again. Do you hear me?\"\n Some of the tension in her body eased and she leaned against me. \"But I didn\u0027t tell you.\"\n No, she hadn\u0027t but I understood. It sucked but I understood. \"I wish you had. I\u0027d have never let you be sick on your own. I\u0027d have taken care of you. I\u0027m going to take care of you now. I\u0027ll make up for it. I swear.\"\n Blaire shook her head and pushed away from me. \"No. I can\u0027t. We can\u0027t do this. I didn\u0027t tell you for a reason. We... we need to talk.\"\n I was taking care of her and she wasn\u0027t leaving me. But if she needed to talk about it then I\u0027d let her. \"Okay. Let\u0027s go to your place since we\u0027re so close.\"\n Blaire nodded and turned to walk toward the condo she\u0027d been running for earlier. Jace had said Woods was letting them stay there for the same amount as Bethy\u0027s old apartment. He thought Woods was thinking of using it as a tax write off or something. I understood now. He\u0027d been doing it for Blaire. He\u0027d been taking care of her. Not anymore he wasn\u0027t. I was taking care of what was mine. I didn\u0027t need Woods doing it. I\u0027d go talk to Woods later but I\u0027d be paying the prime amount for rent on this place. Woods was not taking care of Blaire. She was mine.\n I watched as she bent down and got the key from under the mat. That had to be the worst hiding spot ever for a key. I\u0027d deal with that later too. I wasn\u0027t going to be able to sleep at night knowing she had a key tucked under her front door mat for anyone to walk in on her.\n Blaire opened the door and stepped back. \"Come on in.\"\n I stepped inside and took her hand with me as I passed her. She might want to tell me all the reasons we couldn\u0027t be together but I was going to be touching her while she talked. I needed to know she was okay. Touching her calmed me down.\n She closed the door and let me pull her over to the sofa. I sat down and pulled her down beside me. I wanted to put her in my lap but the worried, nervous look on her face stopped me. She needed to talk and I was going to let her.\n \"I should have told you. I\u0027m sorry I didn\u0027t. I was going to; maybe not the way I did today but I was going to tell you. I just needed time to decide on where I was going to go next and what I was going to do with my life. I wanted to save up and go start somewhere new. For the baby. But I was going to tell you.\"\n She was going to tell me and then leave me? Panic gripped me. She couldn\u0027t do that. \"You can\u0027t leave me,\" I said as plainly as I could. She needed to understand that.\n Blaire dropped her gaze from mine and studied our hands. I\u0027d laced my fingers through hers. It was all that was keeping me calm at the moment. \"Rush,\" she said softly. \"I don\u0027t want my baby to ever feel unwanted. Your family...\" she trailed off and her face had gone pale.\n \"My family will accept what I tell them to accept. If they don\u0027t I will take you and my baby and leave them to pay all their own damn bills. You come first, Blaire.\"\n She shook her head and tugged her hand loose from mine as she stood up. \"No. You say that now but it isn\u0027t true. It wasn\u0027t true a month ago and it isn\u0027t true now. You will always choose them over me. Or at least you will Nan and that\u0027s okay. I understand; I just can\u0027t live with it. I can\u0027t stay here.\"\n Not telling her about her dad was going to haunt me for the rest of my life. My need to protect Nan had fucked up the only thing important to me. I stood up and walked toward her as she backed up until she was against the wall. \"No. One. Comes. Before. You.\"\n Her eyes shimmered with unshed tears and she shook her head. I hated that she couldn\u0027t believe me.\n \"I love you. When you walked into my life I didn\u0027t know you. Nan was my first priority. But you changed that. You changed everything. I was going to tell you but my mom came home too soon. I was so scared to death of losing you that I lost you anyway. Nothing is going to take you away from me again. I\u0027ll spend the rest of my life proving to you that I love you. You and this baby,\" I touched her flat stomach and she trembled, \"come first.\"\n \"I want to believe you,\" she said through a sob.\n \"Let me prove it to you. Leaving me doesn\u0027t let me prove anything. You have to stay with me, Blaire. You have to give me a chance.\"\n A tear slipped free and rolled down her face. \"I\u0027m gonna get big and fat. Babies cry all night and they cost money. I won\u0027t be the same. We won\u0027t be the same. You\u0027ll regret it.\"\n She really didn\u0027t have a clue. No matter how many times I told her, she didn\u0027t believe me. She\u0027d lost everyone in her life she\u0027d loved and trusted. Why should she believe me? The only men in her life had left her. Betrayed her. She expected nothing else.\n \"This baby brought you back to me. It\u0027s a part of us. I will never regret it. And you can get as big as a whale and I\u0027ll love you anyway.\"\n A small smile tugged on her lips. \"I better not get as big as a whale.\"\n I shrugged. \"Doesn\u0027t matter.\"\n Her small smile quickly left. \"Your sister. She\u0027s going to hate this. Me. The baby.\"\n I would deal with Nan. If she couldn\u0027t cope then I\u0027d take Blaire and we\u0027d go somewhere far away from my sister. Blaire had been upset enough. I wasn\u0027t letting anyone else hurt her. \"Trust me to protect you and put you first.\"\n Blaire closed her eyes and then nodded.\n My chest swelled and I wanted to shout to the world that this woman was mine. But instead I picked her up. \"Where\u0027s your bedroom?\" I asked.\n \"The last room on the left.\"\n I walked back there. I wouldn\u0027t make love to her right now but I needed to hold her for awhile. I pushed the door open and I froze. The bedroom was a nice size for a condo but the blanket on the floor with a single pillow was just one more strike against me. When I\u0027d moved them I had known Blaire didn\u0027t have a bed. She\u0027d been sleeping on the couch. But I had been so wrapped up in getting her back I hadn\u0027t thought about her needing a bed.\n \"I haven\u0027t got a bed yet. I could\u0027ve just slept on the couch but I wanted to sleep in my own room.\" Blaire mumbled, trying to get down out of my arms. I wasn\u0027t letting her go. I held her tighter against me. She\u0027d slept on the hard ground last night while I\u0027d been sleeping in my big king size bed. Fuck.\n \"You\u0027re shaking, Rush. Put me down,\" Blaire said, tugging on my arm.\n Without putting her down, I spun around and stalked back to the living room, then out the door. Slamming the door behind me I locked it and stuck the key in my pocket. I wasn\u0027t sticking it back under that damn mat.\n \"What are you doing?\" Blaire asked.\n My car wasn\u0027t here. Then I\u0027d carry her back down the hill and to my Rover. \"I\u0027m taking you to get a bed. A big ass bed. One that costs a fucking fortune,\" I growled. I was furious that I\u0027d missed that one major issue. It was no wonder Woods had been taking care of her. I\u0027d failed. I wasn\u0027t going to fail her again. I\u0027d make sure she had it all.\n \"I don\u0027t need an expensive bed. I\u0027m going to get a bed soon.\"\n \"Yeah, real soon. Tonight,\" I replied then bent my head and kissed her nose. \"Let me do this. I need to do this. I need you tucked into the best bed money can buy. Okay?\"\n A small smile tugged at her lips. \"Okay. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/never-too-far-too-far-2/page-24.html","bookId":1994,"book":{"id":1994,"title":"Never Too Far (Too Far #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Never Too Far (Too Far, #2; Rosemary Beach, #2) \n He had held a secret that destroyed her world. \n Everything she had known was no longer true. \n Blaire couldn’t stop loving him but she knew she could never forgive him. \n Now, she was back home and learning to live again.
