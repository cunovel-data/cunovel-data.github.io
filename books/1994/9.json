{"id":74590,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"Blaire I reached over and nudged Bethy\u0027s leg to wake her up. She\u0027d been asleep for the past two hours. We were just outside of Rosemary Beach and I needed her to drive so I could look for Cain\u0027s truck at all the inexpensive motels. \"We there?\" she mumbled sleepily and sat up in her seat. \"Almost. I need you to drive. I gotta look for Cain\u0027s truck.\" Bethy let out a weary sigh. I knew she was only doing this in hopes of getting me to Rosemary and keeping me there. She could care less about finding Cain. But I\u0027d needed a ride. I was going to drive Cain home. And he and I were going to talk. He had no business coming out here to see Rush. I only hoped he hadn\u0027t told him about what he\u0027d caught me buying. It wasn\u0027t that I wanted to keep it a secret from Rush. It was just that I hadn\u0027t let everything sink in yet. I needed to process it. Figure out what I wanted to do. Then I\u0027d contact Rush. Cain going after him like a crazy person was not what I wanted. I still couldn\u0027t believe he\u0027d done it. \"Pull over here. I need to run in and grab me a latte first,\" Bethy instructed. I did as she asked and parked the car in front of Starbucks. \"You want something?\" Bethy asked as she opened the door. I wasn\u0027t sure that caffeine was good for the... for the baby. I shook my head and waited until she got out of the car before I let out the sob in my chest I hadn\u0027t been expecting. I hadn\u0027t thought about what those two pink stripes meant. A baby. Rush\u0027s baby. Oh, God. I stepped out of the car and walked around the front to get into the passenger side. By the time I was back in the car and buckled up Bethy was headed back to the car. She looked a little more awake already. I pushed thoughts of my baby back and focused on finding Cain. I could dwell on my future, on my baby\u0027s future later. \"Okay. I have caffeine. I\u0027m ready to find this dude.\" I didn\u0027t correct her. I knew she knew his name by now. I\u0027d used it several times. She was just refusing to acknowledge it. This was her form of rebellion. Cain represented Sumit and she didn\u0027t want me in Sumit. Instead of aggravating me it warmed me. She wanted me with her and it felt nice. \"He left Rosemary because of the price of hotel rooms. So, he\u0027s somewhere affordable. Can you take me to a few of those?\" I asked. She nodded but she didn\u0027t look at me. She was texting. Great. I needed her to focus and she was more than likely telling Jace we were almost there. I didn\u0027t really want Jace to know anything. We drove around for thirty minutes with me checking parking lots at all of the cheap motels in town. This was getting frustrating. He had to be here somewhere. \"Can I use your phone? I\u0027m gonna call him again and let him know I\u0027m here looking for him. He\u0027ll tell me where he is when he knows I\u0027ve driven all this way.\" Bethy handed me her phone and I quickly dialed Cain\u0027s number. It rang twice. \"Hello?\" \"Cain. It\u0027s me. Where are you? I\u0027m just outside of Rosemary and I can\u0027t find your truck anywhere.\" There was silence, then \"Dammit.\" \"Don\u0027t get all mad. I needed to check on you. I came out here to drive you home.\" I knew he\u0027d be frustrated that I came this close to Rosemary again. \"I told you I\u0027d be home once I slept it off, Blaire. Whycouldn\u0027t you have stayed put?\" The aggravation in his voice annoyed me. You would think he wasn\u0027t happy I\u0027d come to check on him. \"Where are you, Cain?\" I asked again. Then I heard it. A female voice in the background. The phone became muffled. It didn\u0027t take a genius to figure out Cain was with a female and he was trying to hide it from me. This pissed me off. Not because I thought Cain and I had a chance but because he\u0027d let me think he was hurt and alone in a strange city. Asshole. \"Listen. I don\u0027t have time for more of your stupid ass games, Cain. I\u0027ve been there, done that. Next time, could you not make it sound like you need me when it\u0027s obvious you don\u0027t.\" \"Blaire, no. Listen to me. It isn\u0027t what you think. I couldn\u0027t sleep after you called so I got back in the truck and headed back home. I wanted to see you.\" A girl\u0027s angry scream came from the other side of the phone. He was pissing off whoeverwas with him. The boy was an idiot. \"Go make your company feel better. I don\u0027t need an explanation. I don\u0027t need anything from you. I never did.\" \"BLAIRE! NO! I love you, baby. I love you so much. Please listen to me,\" he begged and the girl with him got more hysterical. \"Shut up Callie!\" he roared and I knew then he was back in Sumit. He was with Callie. \"You went to Callie? You came home so I wouldn\u0027t worry and went to see Callie? You\u0027re ridiculous, Cain. For real? This doesn\u0027t hurt me. You can\u0027t hurt me anymore. But stop and think about others\u0027 feelings for a change. You keep jerking Callie around and it\u0027s wrong. Stop thinking with your penis and grow up.\" I pressed end and handed Bethy back her phone. Her eyes were wide as she stared at me. \"He went back to Sumit,\" I said in way of explanation. \"Yeah... I got that part,\" Bethy said slowly. She was waiting for more. She deserved more. She\u0027d brought me back here. She was also the only real friend I had. Cain wasn\u0027t a friend. Not really. A real friend wouldn\u0027t keep doing stupid stuff like he did. \"Can I sleep at your place tonight? I don\u0027t think I\u0027m going back there. I was leaving soon anyway. I\u0027ll figure out where I\u0027m going tomorrow and then when I get there I\u0027ll have Granny Q ship the rest of my things. It isn\u0027t like I have that much anyway. My truck is headed to the graveyard. It would never make the trip again.\" Bethy nodded and cranked up the car then pulled out onto the road. \"You can stay with me as long as you need. Or longer,\" she replied. \"Thank you,\" I said before laying my head back on the seat and taking a deep breath. What was I going to do now? The smell of bacon got thicker and thicker the more I inhaled. It was as if bacon was taking over my senses. My throat constricted. My stomach rolled from the rich smell of it. The grease sizzled somewhere in the distance. Before I could completely get my eyes open my feet were on the floor and I was running to the bathroom. Luckily Bethy\u0027s apartment wasn\u0027t big and I didn\u0027t have far to run. \"Blaire?\" Bethy\u0027s voice called from the kitchen but I couldn\u0027t stop. Dropping to my knees in front of the toilet I gripped the porcelain seat with both hands and began throwing up everything in my stomach until nothing but dry heaves wracked my body. Everytime I thought I was finished I\u0027d smell the bacon grease mixed with my vomit and it would begin again. I was so weak my body trembled as I tried to vomit and nothing else would come up. A cold washcloth was in my face and Bethy was standing over me flushing the toilet and then leaning me back against the wall. I held the cloth over my nose to block out the smell. Bethy noticed and closed the bathroom door behind her. After she turned on the fan she put her hands on her hips and stared down at me. The disbelief on her face confused me. I got sick. What was so strange about that? \"Bacon? The smell of bacon made you hurl?\" She shook her head, still staring at me as if she couldn\u0027t believe it. \"And you weren\u0027t gonna tell me, were you? You were just gonna put your crazy ass on some damn bus and ride away. All by yourself. I can\u0027t believe you, Blaire. What happened to the smart girl that taught me not to let a man use me? Hmmm? Where the hell did she go? \u0027Cause your plan here sucks.Like bad. You can\u0027t just run off. You have friends here. You\u0027re gonna need friends... and I\u0027d hope that you intended to tell Rush about this too. I know you well enough to know that this is his baby.\" How did she know? I just threw up. Lots of people get viruses. \"It\u0027s a virus,\" I muttered. \"Don\u0027t lie to me. It was the bacon, Blaire. You were sleeping so peacefully on the couch and the minute I started cooking the bacon you started making weird noises and tossing and turning. Then you shot off like a bullet to puke your guts out. Not rocket science baby. Get that shocked look off your face.\" I couldn\u0027t lie to her. She was my friend. Possibly my only one now. I pulled my knees up to my chin and wrapped my arms around my legs. This was my way of holding myself together. When I felt like the world was breaking around me and I couldn\u0027t control it I always held together this way. \"That\u0027s why Cain came here. He caught me buying pregnancy tests yesterday. I know that\u0027s why he came here. To ask Rush... to ask about the relationship between Rush and me.It\u0027s something I refused to talk to Cain about. I didn\u0027t want to talk about Rush at all. Then I was late. Two weeks late. I thought I\u0027d buy a couple of tests and it would come back negative and everything would be okay.\" I stopped my explanation and rested my cheek against my knees. \"The tests... they were positive?\" Bethy asked. I nodded but didn\u0027t look up at her. \"Were you gonna tell Rush? Or were you really gonna just run off?\" What would Rush do? His sister hated me. His mother hated me. They hated my mother. And I hated my father. For Rush to be a part of this baby\u0027s life he\u0027d have to give them up. I couldn\u0027t ask him to give up his mom and sister. Even if they were evil. He loved them. And he wouldn\u0027t give up Nan. I\u0027d already learned that when it came to me or Nan, he\u0027d choose Nan. He had up until the end. When I\u0027d found out everything. He\u0027d kept her secret. He\u0027d chosen her. \"I can\u0027t tell him,\" I said quietly. \"Why is that exactly? Because he\u0027d want to know and his ass needs to be a man and be there for you. This running off shit is stupid.\" She didn\u0027t know everything. She only knew bits and pieces. It had been Nan\u0027s story to tell and no one else\u0027s in Rush\u0027s eyes. But I disagreed. It was my story too. Nan still had both her parents and her brother. I had no one. My mother was dead. My sister was dead. And my father might as well be dead. So this story was just as much mine as it was hers. Maybe more so. I lifted my head and looked up at Bethy. She was my one friend in the world and if I was going to tell this story then she was who I wanted to tell it to.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/never-too-far-too-far-2/page-9.html","bookId":1994,"book":{"id":1994,"title":"Never Too Far (Too Far #2)","description":"Storyline: Never Too Far (Too Far, #2; Rosemary Beach, #2) He had held a secret that destroyed her world.
