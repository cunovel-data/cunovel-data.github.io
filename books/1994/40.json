{"id":74621,"no":40,"title":"Page 40","content":"Rush Seven days and Nan still hadn\u0027t opened her eyes. My mother was stopping by less and less. Grant was starting to be the only visitor that stayed around and showed up regularly. Abe stopped by once a day for only a few minutes at a time. It was Nan and me against the world once again. \"You need to call her,\" Grant said, breaking the silence. I knew who he was talking about. Blaire was constantly on my mind. I felt guilty as I sat here staring at my sister and all I could think about was Blaire. \"I can\u0027t,\" I replied, unable to look at him. He\u0027d see that I\u0027d given up hope if I did. \"This isn\u0027t fair to her. Woods said she isn\u0027t coming around and she hasn\u0027t called him in three days. He keeps a check on things through Bethy but even Bethy isn\u0027t sure Blaire is going to stay much longer. You just need to call her.\" Leaving me would be the best thing she ever did. How could I be what she deserved if I was torn between my sister and her all the time? I couldn\u0027t keep Nan safe. How could she trust me to keep her and our baby safe? \"She deserves better,\" I managed to say it aloud. Instead of just chanting it in my head. \"Yeah, she probably does. But she wants you.\" God, that hurt. I wanted her too. I wanted our baby. I wanted that life I let myself pretend we could have. How could I give that to her if my sister never woke up? I\u0027d be riddled with guilt and pain. I wouldn\u0027t be the man she deserved. This would eventually eat at me until I was worthless to anyone. \"I can\u0027t,\" was all I managed to say. Grant swore and stood up, slinging his jacket on the floor before he walked out of the room slamming the door behind him. He didn\u0027t understand. No one did. I just stared at the wall across from me. I was starting to go numb. I was losing everything I\u0027d ever let myself love. The door opened and I looked over expecting to see Grant. Instead it was Abe. I wasn\u0027t in the mood to see him. He\u0027d deserted the two people I loved most in the world at some point in their lives. \"Why the fuck do you even come here? You don\u0027t give a shit,\" I snarled. Abe didn\u0027t respond. He walked over to the chair that Grant had just vacated and sat down. He never sat down and stayed for any length of time. The fact he was going to right now didn\u0027t sit well with me. I needed to be alone. \"I do give a shit. Your mother doesn\u0027t know I\u0027m here. She wouldn\u0027t approve of what I\u0027m about to tell you. But I think you deserve to know.\" There was nothing that man had to say that I wanted to hear but I remained silent and waited. The quicker he said what he wanted the sooner he\u0027d be gone. \"Nanette isn\u0027t my daughter. Your mother has always known that. She wanted Nan to be mine but we both knew when she got pregnant that it was impossible. We\u0027d been broken up for over eight months when she called me. She had just found out she was pregnant and she was scared. She was still in love with your dad which was why we broke up to begin with. I couldn\u0027t live up to the legend that was Dean Finlay. I wanted to be enough for someone. I never would be for Georgianna. But I loved her and she was worried about how she was going to manage another child. I was young and stupid so I went back to her and we talked about marriage. I told her I\u0027d have to think about it.\" He stopped and looked over at me. I was still reeling from the fact that he wasn\u0027t Nan\u0027s father. \"Once I got there Georgie was leaving you with Dean whenever she could and still going out with friends as if she wasn\u0027t pregnant. She wouldn\u0027t tell me who the dad was. I had just about met my limit when Rebecca came to visit.\" His eyes went soft and he briefly closed them. I\u0027d never seen the man show that much emotion. \"She was gorgeous. Long blond hair that looked like it was spun by angels. The biggest green eyes I\u0027d ever seen and so damn sweet. She loved you. She didn\u0027t like your mother taking you to Dean. She worried you weren\u0027t safe with a bunch of rock stars. She kept you when your mother went out. She made you these pancakes with Mickey Mouse ears that you loved. I was drawn to her and I couldn\u0027t leave. Your mother used us both for awhile. Rebecca wouldn\u0027t leave because she worried about you. And I wouldn\u0027t leave because I\u0027d fallen in love with Becca.\" This was not the story my mother had told me. This wasn\u0027t the story I\u0027d been led to believe all these years but now that I\u0027d met Blaire... that I knew her... this made a hell of a lot more sense. \"Your mom came home drunk one night. She wasn\u0027t far along in her pregnancy and she announced that Dean was the daddy of this baby too. I was furious that she\u0027d been drinking and even more furious that your father had done this yet again with no intention of doing right by Georgie. So I called him and told him I wanted to talk to him. The talk didn\u0027t go well. He said that the baby wasn\u0027t his. If it was his he\u0027d gladly claim it but it wasn\u0027t. She\u0027d been sleeping with the lead singer of Slacker Demon for over a month. The baby wasKiro\u0027s and well, you\u0027ve grown up around Kiro. You know him well enough to know he isn\u0027t father material.\" Kiro was Nan\u0027s father? I buried my face in my hands as different memories came back to me. Kiro coming over late yelling and cursing at my mom about stealing his kid.Kiro calling my mom a cheap slut and hoping \u0027his girl\u0027 didn\u0027t end up the same way. I\u0027d forgotten those things. Or I\u0027d just blocked them out. \"Through this Becca and I got closer. Dean took you and swore he was going to take care of what was his. Your mother cursed and shoved Becca down a flight of stairs calling her names I will not repeat and told us both to leave after she caught me kissing Becca one night. We left after that. Becca cried a lot because she was worried about you. She always worried about you.\" When he talked about Becca all I could see was Blaire\u0027s face. Her sweet innocent face and my chest felt like it was about to explode. \"I asked Becca to marry me. She agreed. Weeks after our honeymoon we found out she was pregnant with twins. Those girls were my world. I adored the ground they walked on just as much as I adored their mother. Never a day went by that I wasn\u0027t thankful for the life I\u0027d been given.\" He stopped and choked on a sob. \"Then one day Val and I were driving back from shopping. We\u0027d gone to get her some shoes for volleyball. Her foot had grown over the summer but Blaire\u0027s hadn\u0027t. They were nearly identical but it was starting to look like Blaire might be the shorter one out of the two. We were laughing about me singing along to some silly boy band on the radio. I missed... I missed the red light. We were hit on Val\u0027s side of the car by a truck going eighty miles an hour.\" He stopped and ran a hand over his face to wipe the tears and let out another sob. \"I lost my baby girl. I hadn\u0027t been paying attention. With her, I lost my wife who couldn\u0027t look at me and my other daughter who was only a shell of the girl she\u0027d been. Then you showed up with that picture of Nanette and instead of sticking it out and being the man my girls needed me to be, I fled. I told myself they deserved more than I could give them. I\u0027d never be able to forgive myself. I\u0027d never be able to move on and seeing me would only hurt them more. So I left them. I hated myself then; I hate myself now. But I\u0027m a weak man. I should have stayed. When I found out Becca was sick I went on a drinking binge. The idea of a world without Becca in it was impossible for me to accept. But going to see my vibrant wife, who I loved and will always love, lying there dying wasn\u0027t something I could do. I\u0027d buried my daughter. I couldn\u0027t bury my wife. Because I was weak I left my baby girl to bury her momma. I will never forgive myself for that.\" He finally looked my way. \"All you see is a selfish man who only thinks of himself. You\u0027re right. I don\u0027t deserve anyone\u0027s love or forgiveness. I don\u0027t want it. Your mother and Nan wanted me. They both acted like they needed me. I could pretend with them. The truth is your mother is as lost and broken as I am. Maybe for different reasons but we\u0027re both empty inside. I was going to come clean with all this and tell Nan three months ago. I couldn\u0027t continue this farce. I just wanted to go sit by my wife\u0027s grave and grieve. But then Blaire called me. She needed me, but I had nothing to give. So I lied to her. I didn\u0027t know much about the man you\u0027d become but I knew one thing. You loved fiercely. You would do anything for your sister. I had no doubt in my mind that the moment you laid eyes on Blaire that she\u0027d get to you. The sweet gentle spirit that was in her mother is in Blaire. Val was me. But Blaire... she is my Becca. She is so much like her. No man can be around her and not love her. I wanted someone strong and capable of taking care of her. So I sent her to you.\" He wiped away the rest of his tears and stood up. I was speechless. \"Don\u0027t become me. Don\u0027t let her down like I did. You only deserve what you make yourself worthy of. Do what I couldn\u0027t. Be a man.\" Abe turned and walked out without another word.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/never-too-far-too-far-2/page-40.html","bookId":1994,"book":{"id":1994,"title":"Never Too Far (Too Far #2)","description":"Storyline: Never Too Far (Too Far, #2; Rosemary Beach, #2) He had held a secret that destroyed her world.
