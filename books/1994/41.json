My stomach knotted up as I reached for my phone. It was Rush. \"Hello,\" I said almost afraid of what he\u0027d called to tell me. \"Hey, it\u0027s me.\" His voice sounded like he\u0027d been crying. Oh god... please don\u0027t let Nan be dead. \"Is she okay?\" I asked, hoping that this time God had actually heard my prayer. \"She\u0027s awake. She\u0027s a little disoriented but she knew me when she opened her eyes so her memory is good.\" \"Oh thank God.\" I sat down on the bed and decided I needed to try this praying thing a little more often. \"I\u0027m sorry, Blaire. I\u0027m so sorry.\" His voice was hoarse. I could hear the pain laced in his words and I didn\u0027t have to ask what he meant. This was it. He just couldn\u0027t say it. \"It\u0027s okay. Just take care of Nan. I\u0027m really glad she\u0027s okay Rush. You may not believe that but I\u0027ve been praying. I wanted her to be okay.\" I needed him to believe me. Even if there was no love lost between Nan and I she was important to him. \"Thank you,\" he said. \"I\u0027m coming home. I\u0027ll be there no later than tomorrow night.\" I wasn\u0027t sure if this meant he wanted me gone by then or would we\u0027d do our goodbyes in person. Running would be so much easier. Not having to face him. It hurt bad enough on the phone. Seeing his face was going to be so hard but I couldn\u0027t let it destroy me. I had our baby to think about. This wasn\u0027t just about me anymore. \"I\u0027ll see you then,\" I replied. \"I love you.\" Hearing the words hurt more than anything else. I wanted to believe he did but it wasn\u0027t enough. The love he might feel for me wasn\u0027t enough. \"I love you too,\" I replied and hung up the phone before curling into a ball and crying myself to sleep. The doorbell rang just as I was getting out of the shower. I grabbed the clothes I\u0027d laid out to wear and quickly got dressed before wrapping my hair in a towel and hurrying downstairs. When I opened the door and saw my father standing there I wasn\u0027t sure what to think. Had Rush sent him to get rid of me? No. Rush wouldn\u0027t do that. But why was he here? \"Hey, Blaire. I, uh, came to talk to you.\" He didn\u0027t look like he\u0027d slept in days and his clothes were rumpled. Seeing the daughter he did love in the hospital must have been hard on him. I pushed that bitterness away. I wasn\u0027t going to think about that. He was Nan\u0027s dad too. At least he was there for her now even if he\u0027d screwed her over the first part of her life. \"What about?\" I asked, not moving to let him in. I wasn\u0027t sure there was anything he had to say that I wanted to hear. \"It\u0027s about Nan... and you.\" I shook my head. \"Don\u0027t care. I\u0027m not up for hearing anything you have to say. Your daughter woke up. I\u0027m glad she didn\u0027t die.\" I started to close the door. \"Nan isn\u0027t my daughter,\" he said. The only words that would have stopped me from slamming the door in his face. I let his words sink in as I slowly opened the door back up. What did he mean Nan wasn\u0027t his daughter? I just stared at him. This made no sense. \"I need to tell you the truth. Rush is going to tell Nan when she\u0027s ready. But I wanted to be the one to tell you.\" What did Rush know? Had he been lying to me? I wasn\u0027t sure I could breathe. \"Rush?\" I asked, backing up in case I couldn\u0027t get a deep breath and passed out. I needed to sit down. \"I told Rush everything yesterday. He had been told the same lie you had but he knows the truth now.\" The truth. What was the truth? Was there a truth or was my entire existence a lie? I sank down onto the steps and stared up at the man I thought was my father as he stepped inside and closed the door behind him. \"I\u0027ve always known Nan wasn\u0027t my daughter. More importantly, your mother knew Nan wasn\u0027t my daughter. You\u0027re right, your mother would have never allowed me to leave my pregnant fianceand run off with her. Not for anything. She almost didn\u0027t let me leave my ex-girlfriend who was pregnant with yet another member of Slacker Demon\u0027s kid because she was worried about what would happen to Rush. Her heart was just as big as you know it was. Nothing you knew was a lie, Blaire. Nothing. The world you knew was not a lie.\" \"I don\u0027t understand. I know my momma wasn\u0027t involved in any of this. That was never a question in my mind. But I don\u0027t understand. If you aren\u0027t Nan\u0027s dad, why did you leave us for them?\" \"I met your mother while trying to help my ex-girlfriend deal with her latest problem. Your mother had come to help her friend too. We both cared about Georgianna. She\u0027d needed us and we tried to help. But while she was out partying and acting like she didn\u0027t have a little boy at home to take care of and a pregnancy she was ignoring, I fell in love with your mother. She was everything Georgianna wasn\u0027t. I adored her, and for whatever reason, she fell in love with me. When we left, Dean had come to take Rush and Kiro, the lead singer of Slacker Demon and Nan\u0027s real father, had stepped in to offer his assistance. Georgianna found out about Becca and me. She sent us packing and we gladly went. Your mother worried over Rush and called Dean to check on him for awhile.\" \"Mom knew Rush?\" Picturing my mother taking care of Rush as a little boy stuck with two screwed up parents brought tears to my eyes. He\u0027d known how wonderful my mother was once even if he didn\u0027t remember. \"Yeah. He called her Beck Beck. He preferred her overGeorgianna and that didn\u0027t settle well with Georgie either. Once Georgianna got Rush back she refused to let your mother check on him. Your mother cried for weeks worrying over the little boy she\u0027d grown to love. But that was your mom. Always caring too much. Her heart was bigger than anyone I\u0027d ever known... until you. You\u0027re just like her, sweetheart.\" I held up my hands to stop him. We would not be bonding over this. I wasn\u0027t crying because I knew my mother was innocent of the lies I\u0027d heard before. I was crying because she\u0027d loved Rush once too, his entire childhood hadn\u0027t been lonely. \"I\u0027m almost done. Let me finish, then I\u0027ll leave and you\u0027ll never see me again. I swear.\" He knew I was leaving too. That this thing with Rush and me was over. The sharp pain in my chest was almost too much. \"Val\u0027s death was my fault. I ran that red light. I hadn\u0027t been paying attention and I lost one of my girls that day. But I lost you and your mother too. You were both hurting so bad and it was all my fault. I wasn\u0027t man enough to stay and bear seeing you both in so much pain. So I ran. I let you take care of Becca when it should have been me but I was too weak. I couldn\u0027t stand the thought of seeing my Becca sick. It would end me. I drank myself into a stupor. It was the only way to stay numb. Then you called and said she\u0027d died. My Becca wasn\u0027t on this earth any longer. I was going to tell Nan the truth about her father and I was going to leave. I wasn\u0027t sure where I\u0027d go but I didn\u0027t care if I lived or died. Then you called and needed me. I wasn\u0027t even a man anymore. I was worthless. But I couldn\u0027t let you down. I\u0027d already made you suffer so much alone. I sent you to Rush. He wasn\u0027t exactly the kind of guy a man wants his daughter around but I knew he\u0027d see in you what I saw in Becca. A lifeline. A reason to live.A reason to fight.A reason to change. He was strong. He could protect you and I knew if pushed he would.\" This was all too much. I couldn\u0027t make sense of it. He had sent me to Rush? The guy who adored a sister who hated me and blamed me for everything wrong in her life? \"He hated me,\" I told him. \"He hated who I was.\" My father\u0027s smile was sad. \"Yes, he hated who he thought you were, but then he met you. He was around you and that was all it took. You are rare, Blaire. Just as your mother was. There aren\u0027t many people in this world as strong as you are. As full of love and willing to forgive. You always envied the way Val could charm a room. You thought she got the best out of the two of you. But what Val knew and what I knew was that we were the lucky ones because we had people like you and your mother in our lives. Val adored you. She saw that you were the one that had your mother\u0027s spirit. We stood in awe of the both of you. I still do and although all I\u0027ve done is hurt you since the day we lost your sister, I have loved you. I always will. You\u0027re my little girl. You deserve the best in this world and I\u0027m not the best. I\u0027m walking away and I\u0027m not going to bother you ever again. I need to live out the rest of this life alone. Remembering what I once had.\" The grief in his eyes tore at my soul. He was right. He\u0027d deserted me and momma when we needed him the most. But maybe we\u0027d deserted him too. We hadn\u0027t gone after him. We\u0027d just let him go. The day we lost Valerie had marked all our lives. Momma and Val were gone now and we could never get them back. But we were here. I didn\u0027t want to live the rest of my life knowing my father was out there somewhere alone. My momma wouldn\u0027t want that. She never wanted him to be alone. She loved him until she drew her last breath. Val wouldn\u0027t want that. She\u0027d been a daddy\u0027s girl. I stood up and took a step toward him. The unshed tears in his eyes slowly began to trickle down his face. He was a shell of the man he once was but he was my dad. A sob tore from my chest and I threw myself into his arms. When they wrapped around me and held me tightly I let all the pain free. I cried for the life we\u0027d lost. I cried for him because he wasn\u0027t strong enough and I cried for me because it was time.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/never-too-far-too-far-2/page-41.html","bookId":1994,"book":{"id":1994,"title":"Never Too Far (Too Far #2)","description":"Storyline: Never Too Far (Too Far, #2; Rosemary Beach, #2) He had held a secret that destroyed her world.
