{"id":74601,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"Rush\n Jace had called to let me know the girls were moving into the condo on the club property today. I hadn\u0027t seen her since the incident on the golf course. Not for lack of trying. I\u0027d tried to put myself in her path at the club several times and it never worked. I\u0027d even stopped by yesterday and she\u0027d been gone. Darla had said she and Bethy were both off work so I assumed they\u0027d gone to do something together.\n I pulled up to Bethy\u0027s apartment and instantly noticed Woods\u0027 car. What the hell was he doing here? I jerked my door open and headed for the door when I heard Blaire\u0027s voice. Turning I walked toward Woods\u0027 car until I saw Woods leaning against the wall it was parked beside and listening to Blaire with a smile on his face. One I was about to wipe off.\n \"If you\u0027re sure, then thank you,\" Blaire said quietly as if she didn\u0027t want anyone to hear her.\n \"Positive,\" Woods replied as his eyes lifted to meet mine. The smile on his face disappeared.\n Blaire turned her head to glance over her shoulder. The surprise on her face as her eyes met mine hurt. Maybe I shouldn\u0027t be here right now. I didn\u0027t want to lose it and scare her off but I was real close to going into a blind rage. Why were they talking alone? What was he positive about?\n \"Rush?\" Blaire said, walking away from Woods and toward me. \"What are you doing here?\"\n Woods chuckled and shook his head then opened his car door. \"I\u0027m sure he came to help. I\u0027ll leave before he takes that ugly scowl out on me.\"\n He was leaving. Good.\n \"Are you here to help us move?\" she asked, watching me carefully.\n \"Yeah, I am,\" I replied. The tension left me as Woods\u0027 BMW roared to life and he drove off.\n \"How did you know we were moving?\"\n \"Jace called me,\" I replied.\n She shifted her feet nervously. I hated that I made her nervous.\n \"I wanted to help, Blaire. I\u0027m sorry about Nan the other day. I\u0027ve talked to her. She won\u0027t be - \"\n \"Don\u0027t worry about it. You don\u0027t have to apologize for her. I don\u0027t hold it against you. I understand.\"\n No, she didn\u0027t. I could see it in her eyes that she didn\u0027t understand. I reached out and took her hand. I just needed to touch her somehow. She trembled as my fingers brushed her palm. Her teeth bit down on her bottom lip the same way I wanted to.\n \"Blaire,\" I said and stopped because I wasn\u0027t sure what else to say. The truth was too much right now.\n She lifted her eyes from our hands and I could see the desire there. Really? Was I dreaming this one up or was she... was she really? I slipped a finger up her palm and caressed the inside of her wrist. She trembled again. Holy shit. She was affected by my touch. I stepped closer to her and ran my hand slowly up her arm.I was waiting on her to push me off and put the distance between us I expected from her.\n When I got high enough my thumb grazed the side of her breast and she grabbed my free arm as she shuddered. What the fuck? \"Blaire,\" I whispered, pressing her back until she was against the brick wall of the apartment building and my chest was inches away from touching hers.\n She didn\u0027t push me off and her eyelids looked heavy as she stared at my chest. Her breathing was heavy. The cleavage the little pale pink sundress showed off was right there under my nose. Rising and falling as if it was an invitation.An impossible one. Something was off here.\n I put my other hand on her waist and slowly slid it up her body until my other thumb was tucked under her breast. She wasn\u0027t wearing a bra. Her nipples were hard and erect poking against the thin material of her dress. I couldn\u0027t stop myself. I eased my hand up and covered her right breast squeezing it gently. Blaire whimpered and her knees started to give out. She let her head fall back on the wall and closed her eyes. I held her steady and slipped my leg between hers to keep her from sinking to the ground.\n With my other hand, I covered her left breast and ran the pads of my thumbs over her firm nipples.\n \"Oh God, Rush,\" she moaned, opening her eyes and staring at me through her lowered lashes. Holy fuck. I was in some form of tortured heaven. If this was another dream I was going to be pissed. It felt too real.\n \"Does that feel good, baby?\" I asked, lowering my head to whisper in her ear.\n \"Yes,\" she breathed, sinking down further onto my knee. When her warm center pressed against my leg she gasped and gripped my arms harder. \"Ahhhh,\" she cried out.\n I was going to come in my pants. I\u0027d never been this turned on in my life. Something was different. This wasn\u0027t the same. She was almost desperate. I could sense her fear but her need was stronger. \"Blaire, tell me what you want me to do. I\u0027ll do whatever it is you need,\" I promised her, kissing the soft skin under her ear. She smelled so damn good. I kneaded her breasts in my hands again and she let out a pleading whimper. My sweet Blaire was incredibly horny. This was real. This wasn\u0027t a damn dream. Holy fuck.\n \"Blaire!\" The shrill call of Bethy\u0027s voice was like a bucket of ice water thrown over Blaire. She stiffened then stood up dropping her hands from me and scooted away. She couldn\u0027t look up at me.\n \"I... uh... I\u0027m sorry. I don\u0027t know...\" She shook her head and hurried away from me. I watched until she was at the door and Bethy was talking to her sternly. Blaire was nodding. Once they went inside I slammed both hands against the brick and muttered a string of curses while I attempted like hell to get my raging hard on under control.\n After a few minutes the door opened again and I turned to see Jace walking out. He looked over at me and let out a low whistle. \"Damn man, you work fast.\"\n I didn\u0027t even respond to that. He didn\u0027t know what he was talking about. Blaire had been hungry for my touch. She hadn\u0027t pushed me away. She\u0027d been almost begging me silently. It made no sense but she\u0027d wanted me. God knows I wanted her. I always wanted her.\n \"Come on. We have a couch to move. I need your help,\" Jace said, holding the door open. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/never-too-far-too-far-2/page-20.html","bookId":1994,"book":{"id":1994,"title":"Never Too Far (Too Far #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Never Too Far (Too Far, #2; Rosemary Beach, #2) \n He had held a secret that destroyed her world. \n Everything she had known was no longer true. \n Blaire couldn’t stop loving him but she knew she could never forgive him. \n Now, she was back home and learning to live again.
