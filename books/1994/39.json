The woman across from me was snuggled up against her husband\u0027s arm. He kept whispering into her ear making her smile. His hand never left her stomach. There was no possessiveness in his demeanor. Just protectiveness. It was if he was protecting his wife and child with that simple gesture. The other lady was much further along than either of us and her baby was moving. Her husband had both his hands on her stomach as he stared at her in awe. There was a sweet worshipful look on his face. They were sharing a moment and just glancing over in that direction made me feel as if I were intruding on it. Then there was me. With Woods. I had told him he didn\u0027t need to come with me but he said he\u0027d like to. He wasn\u0027t going back in the exam room because I wasn\u0027t about to let him see me almost naked in a thin cotton exam robe but he was going to sit in the waiting room. He had fixed himself a cup of the complimentary coffee and since he\u0027d only taken one sip I assumed it tasted horrible. I missed coffee. It would probably be delicious to me. I needed to buy some decaffeinated coffee. \"Blaire Wynn,\" the nurse called out from the doorway leading back to the exam rooms. I stood up and smiled down at Woods. \"I shouldn\u0027t be too long.\" He shrugged. \"I\u0027m not in a hurry.\" \"Your husband can come back with you,\" the nurse said cheerily. My face was instantly warm. I knew without looking my cheeks were flushed. \"He\u0027s just a friend,\" I quickly corrected her. This time she was the one turning pink. She obviously hadn\u0027t read over my record to see that I was single. \"I\u0027m so sorry. Uh, well he can come back too if he wants to hear the heart beat.\" I shook my head. That was too personal. Woods was a friend but I wasn\u0027t ready to share something as important as my baby\u0027s heartbeat with him. Rush hadn\u0027t even heard the baby\u0027s heartbeat yet. \"No, that\u0027s okay.\" I didn\u0027t glance back at Woods because I was embarrassed for both of us. He was just helping out. Being labeled as the baby daddy hadn\u0027t been what he\u0027d signed up for. The exam didn\u0027t take long. This time I\u0027d been able to hear the baby\u0027s heartbeat without having a wand stuck inside me. It had been just as loud and sweet as before. The pregnancy was progressing well and I was cleared to go with an appointment for four weeks from now. Walking back out into the waiting room I found Woods reading a Parenting magazine. He looked up at me and smiled sheepishly. \"The reading material here is limited,\" he explained. I stifled a laugh. He stood up and we walked out of the door together. Once we were in the car he looked over at me. \"You hungry?\" I was actually but the longer I spent with Woods the more uncomfortable I felt. I couldn\u0027t shake the feeling that Rush wouldn\u0027t like this. He had never liked me being around Woods much. Even though I had needed a ride I was starting to worry this was a bad idea. It was better if Woods just drove me back to Rush\u0027s house. \"I\u0027m more tired than anything. Can you just take me back to Rush\u0027s?\" I asked \"Of course,\" he replied with a smile. Woods was really easy to deal with. I liked that. I wasn\u0027t in the mood for difficult. \"Have you talked to Rush yet?\" he asked. That wasn\u0027t a question I wanted to answer. So much for not being difficult. I just shook my head. He didn\u0027t need an explanation and if he did too bad because I didn\u0027t have one. I\u0027d broken down and called Rush two nights ago and it had gone directly to voice mail. I\u0027d left him a message but he hadn\u0027t called back. I was beginning to wonder if he was hoping I\u0027d just be gone when he returned. How long was I supposed to stay at his house? \"He isn\u0027t dealing with this well, I imagine. He\u0027ll call you soon,\" Woods said. I could tell by the tone of his voice that he didn\u0027t even believe what he was saying. It was just to make me feel better. I closed my eyes and pretended to sleep so he wouldn\u0027t say anymore. I didn\u0027t want to talk about this. I didn\u0027t want to talk about anything. Woods turned the radio on and we drove in silence the rest of the way back to Rosemary. When the car came to a stop I opened my eyes to see Rush\u0027s house in front of me. I was back. \"Thank you,\" I said, looking over at Woods. His expression was serious. I could tell he was thinking about something that he didn\u0027t want to share with me. I didn\u0027t need to ask to know what it was. He thought I should leave too. Rush wasn\u0027t going to call and there was a chance he might not come back. I couldn\u0027t just live in his house. \"Call me if you need anything,\" Woods said meeting my gaze. I nodded but I\u0027d already made up my mind I wasn\u0027t going to call him anymore. Even if Rush didn\u0027t care what I did it just didn\u0027t feel right. I opened the car door and stepped out. With a final wave I headed to the front door and back into the empty house.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/never-too-far-too-far-2/page-39.html","bookId":1994,"book":{"id":1994,"title":"Never Too Far (Too Far #2)","description":"Storyline: Never Too Far (Too Far, #2; Rosemary Beach, #2) He had held a secret that destroyed her world.
