[bbe] And you will not get away from him, but will certainly be taken and given up into his hands; and you will see the king of Babylon, eye to eye, and he will have talk with you, mouth to mouth, and you will go to Babylon. 34:4 [hgb] 犹 大 王 西 底 家 阿 ， 你 还 要 听 耶 和 华 的 话 。 耶 和 华 论 到 你 如 此 说 ， 你 必 不 被 刀 剑 杀 死 ， [kjv] Yet hear the word of the LORD, O Zedekiah king of Judah; Thus saith the LORD of thee, Thou shalt not die by the sword: [bbe] But give ear to the word of the Lord, O Zedekiah, king of Judah; this is what the Lord has said about you: Death will not come to you by the sword: 34:5 [hgb] 你 必 平 安 而 死 ， 人 必 为 你 焚 烧 物 件 ， 好 像 为 你 列 祖 ， 就 是 在 你 以 前 的 先 王 焚 烧 一 般 。 人 必 为 你 举 哀 ， 说 ， 哀 哉 。 我 主 阿 。 耶 和 华 说 ， 这 话 是 我 说 的 。 [kjv] But thou shalt die in peace: and with the burnings of thy fathers, the former kings which were before thee, so shall they burn odours for thee; and they will lament thee, saying, Ah lord! for I have pronounced the word, saith the LORD. [bbe] You will come to your end in peace; and such burnings as they made for your fathers, the earlier kings before you, will be made for you; and they will be weeping for you and saying, Ah lord! for I have said the word, says the Lord. 34:6 [hgb] 于 是 ， 先 知 耶 利 米 在 耶 路 撒 冷 将 这 一 切 话 告 诉 犹 大 王 西 底 家 。 [kjv] Then Jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem, [bbe] Then Jeremiah the prophet said all these things to Zedekiah, king of Judah, in Jerusalem, 34:7 [hgb] 那 时 ， 巴 比 伦 王 的 军 队 正 攻 打 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 又 攻 打 犹 大 所 剩 下 的 城 邑 ， 就 是 拉 吉 和 亚 西 加 。 原 来 犹 大 的 坚 固 城 只 剩 下 这 两 座 。 [kjv] When the king of Babylon\u0027s army fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish, and against Azekah: for these defenced cities remained of the cities of Judah. [bbe] When the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and against all the towns of Judah which had not been taken, against Lachish and against Azekah; for these were the last of the walled towns of Judah. 34:8 [hgb] 西 底 家 王 与 耶 路 撒 冷 的 众 民 立 约 ， 要 向 他 们 宣 告 自 由 ， 叫 各 人 任 他 希 伯 来 的 仆 人 和 婢 女 自 由 出 去 ， 谁 也 不 可 使 他 的 一 个 犹 大 弟 兄 作 奴 仆 。 （ 此 后 ， 有 耶 和 华 的 话 临 到 耶 利 米 。 ） [kjv] This is the word that came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, after that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people which were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty unto them; [bbe] The word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord, after King Zedekiah had made an agreement with all the people in Jerusalem, to give news in public that servants were to be made free; 34:9 [hgb] [kjv] That every man should let his manservant, and every man his maidservant, being an Hebrew or an Hebrewess, go free; that none should serve himself of them, to wit, of a Jew his brother. [bbe] That every man was to let his Hebrew man-servant and his Hebrew servant-girl go free; so that no one might make use of a Jew, his countryman, as a servant: 34:10 [hgb] 所 有 立 约 的 首 领 和 众 民 就 任 他 的 仆 人 婢 女 自 由 出 去 ， 谁 也 不 再 叫 他 们 作 奴 仆 。 大 家 都 顺 从 ， 将 他 们 释 放 了 。 [kjv] Now when all the princes, and all the people, which had entered into the covenant, heard that every one should let his manservant, and every one his maidservant, go free, that none should serve themselves of them any more, then they obeyed, and let them go. [bbe] And this was done by all the rulers and the people who had taken part in the agreement, and every one let his man-servant and his servant-girl go free, not to be used as servants any longer; they did so, and let them go. 34:11 [hgb] 后 来 却 又 反 悔 ， 叫 所 任 去 自 由 的 仆 人 婢 女 回 来 ， 勉 强 他 们 仍 为 仆 婢 。 [kjv] But afterward they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids. [bbe] But later, they took back again the servants and the servant-girls whom they had let go free, and put them again under the yoke as servants and servant-girls. 34:12 [hgb] 因 此 耶 和 华 的 话 临 到 耶 利 米 说 ， [kjv] Therefore the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, [bbe] For this reason the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying, 34:13 [hgb] 耶 和 华 以 色 列 的 神 如 此 说 ， 我 将 你 们 的 列 祖 从 埃 及 地 为 奴 之 家 领 出 来 的 时 候 ， 与 他 们 立 约 说 ， [kjv] Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondmen, saying, [bbe] The Lord, the God of Israel, has said, I made an agreement with your fathers on the day when I took them out of Egypt, out of the prison-house, saying, 34:14 [hgb] 你 的 一 个 希 伯 来 弟 兄 若 卖 给 你 ， 服 事 你 六 年 ， 到 第 七 年 你 们 各 人 就 要 任 他 自 由 出 去 。 只 是 你 们 列 祖 不 听 从 我 ， 也 不 侧 耳 而 听 。 [kjv] At the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother an Hebrew, which hath been sold unto thee; and when he hath served thee six years, thou shalt let him go free from thee: but your fathers hearkened not unto me, neither inclined their ear. [bbe] At the end of seven years every man is to let go his countryman who is a Hebrew, who has become yours for a price and has been your servant for six years; you are to let him go free: but your fathers gave no attention and did not give ear. 34:15 [hgb] 如 今 你 们 回 转 ， 行 我 眼 中 看 为 正 的 事 ， 各 人 向 邻 舍 宣 告 自 由 ， 并 且 在 称 为 我 名 下 的 殿 中 ， 在 我 面 前 立 约 。 [kjv] And ye were now turned, and had done right in my sight, in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour; and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name: [bbe] And now, turning away from evil, you had done what is right in my eyes, giving a public undertaking for every man to make his neighbour free; and you had made an agreement before me in the house which is named by my name: 34:16 [hgb] 你 们 却 又 反 悔 ， 亵 渎 我 的 名 ， 各 人 叫 所 任 去 随 意 自 由 的 仆 人 婢 女 回 来 ， 勉 强 他 们 仍 为 仆 婢 。 [kjv] But ye turned and polluted my name, and caused every man his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom he had set at liberty at their pleasure, to return, and brought them into subjection, to be unto you for servants and for handmaids. [bbe] But again you have put shame on my name, and you have taken back, every one his man-servant and his servant-girl, whom you had sent away free, and you have put them under the yoke again to be your servants and servant-girls. 34:17 [hgb] 所 以 耶 和 华 如 此 说 ， 你 们 没 有 听 从 我 ， 各 人 向 弟 兄 邻 舍 宣 告 自 由 。 看 哪 。 我 向 你 们 宣 告 一 样 自 由 ， 就 是 使 你 们 自 由 于 刀 剑 ， 饥 荒 ， 瘟 疫 之 下 ， 并 且 使 你 们 在 天 下 万 国 中 抛 来 抛 去 。 这 是 耶 和 华 说 的 。 [kjv] Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ye have not hearkened unto me, in proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother, and every man to his neighbour: behold, I proclaim a liberty for you, saith the LORD, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine; and I will make you to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth. [bbe] And so the Lord has said, You have not given ear to me and undertaken publicly, every man to let loose his countryman and his neighbour: see, I undertake to let loose against you the sword and disease and need of food; and I will send you wandering among all the kingdoms of the earth. 34:18 [hgb] 犹 大 的 首 领 ， 耶 路 撒 冷 的 首 领 ， 太 监 ， 祭 司 ， 和 国 中 的 众 民 曾 将 牛 犊 劈 开 ， 分 成 两 半 ， 从 其 中 经 过 ， 在 我 面 前 立 约 。 后 来 又 违 背 我 的 约 ， 不 遵 行 这 约 上 的 话 。 [kjv] And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant, which have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me, when they cut the calf in twain, and passed between the parts thereof, [bbe] And I will give the men who have gone against my agreement and have not given effect to the words of the agreement which they made before me, when the ox was cut in two and they went between the parts of it, 34:19 [hgb] [kjv] The princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land, which passed between the parts of the calf; [bbe] The rulers of Judah and the rulers of Jerusalem, the unsexed servants and the priests and all the people of the land who went between the parts of the ox, 34:20 [hgb] 我 必 将 他 们 交 在 仇 敌 和 寻 索 其 命 的 人 手 中 。 他 们 的 尸 首 必 给 空 中 的 飞 鸟 和 地 上 的 野 兽 作 食 物 。 [kjv] I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life: and their dead bodies shall be for meat unto the fowls of the heaven, and to the beasts of the earth. [bbe] Even these I will give up into the hands of their haters and into the hands of those who have designs against their lives: and their dead bodies will become food for the birds of heaven and the beasts of the earth. 34:21 [hgb] 并 且 我 必 将 犹 大 王 西 底 家 和 他 的 首 领 交 在 他 们 仇 敌 和 寻 索 其 命 的 人 ， 与 那 暂 离 你 们 而 去 巴 比 伦 王 军 队 的 手 中 。 [kjv] And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon\u0027s army, which are gone up from you. [bbe] And Zedekiah, king of Judah, and his rulers I will give into the hands of their haters and into the hands of those who have designs against their lives, and into the hands of the king of Babylon\u0027s army which has gone away from you. 34:22 [hgb] 耶 和 华 说 ， 我 必 吩 咐 他 们 回 到 这 城 ， 攻 打 这 城 ， 将 城 攻 取 ， 用 火 焚 烧 。 我 也 要 使 犹 大 的 城 邑 变 为 荒 场 ， 无 人 居 住 。 [kjv] Behold, I will command, saith the LORD, and cause them to return to this city; and they shall fight against it, and take it, and burn it with fire: and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without an inhabitant. [bbe] See, I will give orders, says the Lord, and make them come back to this town; and they will make war on it and take it and have it burned with fire: and I will make the towns of Judah waste and unpeopled.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/128/1945.html","bookId":158,"book":{"id":158,"title":"耶利米书 Jeremiah","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 便 雅 悯 地 亚 拿 突 城 的 祭 司 中 ， 希 勒 家 的 儿 子 耶 利 米 的 话 记 在 下 面 。 [kjv] The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/128","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:20 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
