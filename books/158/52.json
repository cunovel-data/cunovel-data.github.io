And his mother\u0027s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. \n [bbe] Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king; he was king for eleven years in Jerusalem: and his mother\u0027s name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. \n 52:2 [hgb] 西 底 家 行 耶 和 华 眼 中 看 为 恶 的 事 ， 是 照 约 雅 敬 一 切 所 行 的 。 \n [kjv] And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD, according to all that Jehoiakim had done. \n [bbe] And he did evil in the eyes of the Lord, as Jehoiakim had done. \n 52:3 [hgb] 因 此 耶 和 华 的 怒 气 在 耶 路 撒 冷 和 犹 大 发 作 ， 以 致 将 人 民 从 自 己 的 面 前 赶 出 。 \n [kjv] For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, till he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon. \n [bbe] And because of the wrath of the Lord this came about in Jerusalem and Judah, till he had sent them away from before him: and Zedekiah took up arms against the king of Babylon. \n 52:4 [hgb] 西 底 家 背 叛 巴 比 伦 王 。 他 作 王 第 九 年 十 月 初 十 日 ， 巴 比 伦 王 尼 布 甲 尼 撒 率 领 全 军 来 攻 击 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 对 城 安 营 ， 四 围 筑 垒 攻 城 。 \n [kjv] And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it, and built forts against it round about. \n [bbe] And in the ninth year of his rule, on the tenth day of the tenth month, Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, came against Jerusalem with all his army and took up his position before it, building earthworks all round it. \n 52:5 [hgb] 于 是 城 被 围 困 直 到 西 底 家 王 十 一 年 。 \n [kjv] So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah. \n [bbe] So the town was shut in by their forces till the eleventh year of King Zedekiah. \n 52:6 [hgb] 四 月 初 九 日 ， 城 里 有 大 饥 荒 ， 甚 至 百 姓 都 没 有 粮 食 。 \n [kjv] And in the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land. \n [bbe] In the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, the store of food in the town was almost gone, so that there was no food for the people of the land. \n 52:7 [hgb] 城 被 攻 破 ， 一 切 兵 丁 就 在 夜 间 从 靠 近 王 园 两 城 中 间 的 门 ， 出 城 逃 跑 。 迦 勒 底 人 正 在 四 围 攻 城 。 他 们 就 往 亚 拉 巴 逃 去 。 \n [kjv] Then the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled, and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king\u0027s garden; (now the Chaldeans were by the city round about:) and they went by the way of the plain. \n [bbe] Then an opening was made in the wall of the town, and all the men of war went in flight out of the town by night through the doorway between the two walls which was by the king\u0027s garden; (now the Chaldaeans were stationed round the town:) and they went by the way of the Arabah. \n 52:8 [hgb] 迦 勒 底 的 军 队 追 赶 西 底 家 王 ， 在 耶 利 哥 的 平 原 追 上 他 。 他 的 全 军 都 离 开 他 四 散 了 。 \n [kjv] But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him. \n [bbe] And the Chaldaean army went after King Zedekiah and overtook him on the other side of Jericho, and all his army went in flight from him in every direction. \n 52:9 [hgb] 迦 勒 底 人 就 拿 住 王 ， 带 他 到 哈 马 地 的 利 比 拉 巴 比 伦 王 那 里 。 巴 比 伦 王 便 审 判 他 。 \n [kjv] Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; where he gave judgment upon him. \n [bbe] Then they made the king a prisoner and took him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath to be judged. \n 52:10 [hgb] 巴 比 伦 王 在 西 底 家 眼 前 杀 了 他 的 众 子 ， 又 在 利 比 拉 杀 了 犹 大 的 一 切 首 领 ， \n [kjv] And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes: he slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah. \n [bbe] And the king of Babylon put the sons of Zedekiah to death before his eyes: and he put to death all the rulers of Judah in Riblah. \n 52:11 [hgb] 并 且 剜 了 西 底 家 的 眼 睛 ， 用 铜 链 锁 着 他 ， 带 到 巴 比 伦 去 ， 将 他 囚 在 监 里 ， 直 到 他 死 的 日 子 。 \n [kjv] Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death. \n [bbe] And he put out Zedekiah\u0027s eyes; and the king of Babylon, chaining him in iron bands, took him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death. \n 52:12 [hgb] 巴 比 伦 王 尼 布 甲 尼 撒 十 九 年 五 月 初 十 日 ， 在 巴 比 伦 王 面 前 侍 立 的 护 卫 长 尼 布 撒 拉 旦 进 入 耶 路 撒 冷 ， \n [kjv] Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, which served the king of Babylon, into Jerusalem, \n [bbe] Now in the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month, in the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan, the captain of the armed men, a servant of the king of Babylon, came into Jerusalem. \n 52:13 [hgb] 用 火 焚 烧 耶 和 华 的 殿 和 王 宫 ， 又 焚 烧 耶 路 撒 冷 的 房 屋 ， 就 是 各 大 户 家 的 房 屋 。 \n [kjv] And burned the house of the LORD, and the king\u0027s house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, and all the houses of the great men, burned he with fire: \n [bbe] And he had the house of the Lord and the king\u0027s house and all the houses of Jerusalem, even every great house, burned with fire: \n 52:14 [hgb] 跟 从 护 卫 长 迦 勒 底 的 全 军 就 拆 毁 耶 路 撒 冷 四 围 的 城 墙 。 \n [kjv] And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the captain of the guard, brake down all the walls of Jerusalem round about. \n [bbe] And the walls round Jerusalem were broken down by the Chaldaean army which was with the captain. \n 52:15 [hgb] 那 时 护 卫 长 尼 布 撒 拉 旦 将 民 中 最 穷 的 和 城 里 所 剩 下 的 百 姓 ， 并 已 经 投 降 巴 比 伦 王 的 人 ， 以 及 大 众 所 剩 下 的 人 ， 都 掳 去 了 。 \n [kjv] Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive certain of the poor of the people, and the residue of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude. \n [bbe] Then Nebuzaradan, the captain of the armed men, took away as prisoners the rest of the people who were still in the town, and those who had given themselves up to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the workmen. \n 52:16 [hgb] 但 护 卫 长 尼 布 撒 拉 旦 留 下 些 民 中 最 穷 的 ， 使 他 们 修 理 葡 萄 园 ， 耕 种 田 地 。 \n [kjv] But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left certain of the poor of the land for vinedressers and for husbandmen. \n [bbe] But Nebuzaradan, the captain of the armed men, let the poorest of the land go on living there, to take care of the vines and the fields. \n 52:17 [hgb] 耶 和 华 殿 的 铜 柱 并 殿 内 的 盆 座 和 铜 海 ， 迦 勒 底 人 都 打 碎 了 ， 将 那 铜 运 到 巴 比 伦 去 了 ， \n [kjv] Also the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brasen sea that was in the house of the LORD, the Chaldeans brake, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon. \n [bbe] And the brass pillars which were in the house of the Lord, and the wheeled bases and the great brass water-vessel in the house of the Lord, were broken up by the Chaldaeans, who took all the brass away to Babylon. \n 52:18 [hgb] 又 带 去 锅 ， 铲 子 ， 蜡 剪 ， 盘 子 ， 调 羹 ， 并 所 用 的 一 切 铜 器 ， \n [kjv] The caldrons also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the bowls, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away. \n [bbe] And the pots and the spades and the scissors for the lights and the spoons, and all the brass vessels used in the Lord\u0027s house, they took away. \n 52:19 [hgb] 杯 ， 火 鼎 ， 碗 ， 盆 ， 灯 台 ， 调 羹 ， 爵 ， 无 论 金 的 银 的 ， 护 卫 长 也 都 带 去 了 。 \n [kjv] And the basons, and the firepans, and the bowls, and the caldrons, and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the cups; that which was of gold in gold, and that which was of silver in silver, took the captain of the guard away. \n [bbe] And the cups and the fire-trays and the basins and the pots and the supports for the lights and the spoons and the wide basins; the gold of the gold vessels, and the silver of the silver vessels, the captain of the armed men took away. \n 52:20 [hgb] 所 罗 门 为 耶 和 华 殿 所 造 的 两 根 铜 柱 ， 一 个 铜 海 ， 并 座 下 的 十 二 只 铜 牛 ， 这 一 切 的 铜 多 得 无 法 可 称 。 \n [kjv] The two pillars, one sea, and twelve brasen bulls that were under the bases, which king Solomon had made in the house of the LORD: the brass of all these vessels was without weight. \n [bbe] The two pillars, the great water-vessel, and the twelve brass oxen which were under it, and the ten wheeled bases, which King Solomon had made for the house of the Lord: the brass of all these vessels was without weight. \n 52:21 [hgb] 这 一 根 柱 子 高 十 八 肘 ， 厚 四 指 ， 是 空 的 ， 围 十 二 肘 。 \n [kjv] And concerning the pillars, the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits; and a fillet of twelve cubits did compass it; and the thickness thereof was four fingers: it was hollow. \n [bbe] And as for the pillars, one pillar was eighteen cubits high, and twelve cubits measured all round, and it was as thick as a man\u0027s hand: it was hollow. \n 52:22 [hgb] 柱 上 有 铜 顶 ， 高 五 肘 。 铜 顶 的 周 围 有 网 子 和 石 榴 ， 都 是 铜 的 。 那 一 根 柱 子 照 此 一 样 ， 也 有 石 榴 。 \n [kjv] And a chapiter of brass was upon it; and the height of one chapiter was five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the chapiters round about, all of brass. The second pillar also and the pomegranates were like unto these. \n [bbe] And there was a crown of brass on it: the crown was five cubits high, circled with a network and apples all of brass; and the second pillar had the same. \n 52:23 [hgb] 柱 子 四 面 有 九 十 六 个 石 榴 ， 在 网 子 周 围 ， 共 有 一 百 石 榴 。 \n [kjv] And there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side; and all the pomegranates upon the network were an hundred round about. \n [bbe] There were ninety-six apples on the outside; the number of apples all round the network was a hundred. \n 52:24 [hgb] 护 卫 长 拿 住 大 祭 司 西 莱 雅 ， 副 祭 司 西 番 亚 ， 和 三 个 把 门 的 ， \n [kjv] And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door: \n [bbe] And the captain of the armed men took Seraiah, the chief priest, and Zephaniah, the second priest, and the three door-keepers; \n 52:25 [hgb] 又 从 城 中 拿 住 一 个 管 理 兵 丁 的 官 （ 或 作 太 监 ） ， 并 在 城 里 所 遇 常 见 王 面 的 七 个 人 和 检 点 国 民 军 长 的 书 记 ， 以 及 城 里 所 遇 见 的 国 民 六 十 个 人 。 \n [kjv] He took also out of the city an eunuch, which had the charge of the men of war; and seven men of them that were near the king\u0027s person, which were found in the city; and the principal scribe of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and threescore men of the people of the land, that were found in the midst of the city. \n [bbe] And from the town he took the unsexed servant who was over the men of war, and seven of the king\u0027s near friends who were in the town, and the scribe of the captain of the army, who was responsible for getting the people of the land together in military order, and sixty men of the people of the land who were in the town. \n 52:26 [hgb] 护 卫 长 尼 布 撒 拉 旦 将 这 些 人 带 到 利 比 拉 巴 比 伦 王 那 里 。 \n [kjv] So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah. \n [bbe] These Nebuzaradan, the captain of the armed men, took with him to the king of Babylon at Riblah. \n 52:27 [hgb] 巴 比 伦 王 就 把 他 们 击 杀 在 哈 马 地 的 利 比 拉 。 这 样 ， 犹 大 人 被 掳 去 离 开 本 地 。 \n [kjv] And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death in Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away captive out of his own land. \n [bbe] And the king of Babylon put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was taken prisoner away from his land. \n 52:28 [hgb] 尼 布 甲 尼 撒 所 掳 的 民 数 记 在 下 面 ， 在 他 第 七 年 掳 去 犹 大 人 三 千 零 二 十 三 名 。 \n [kjv] This is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twenty: \n [bbe] These are the people whom Nebuchadrezzar took away prisoner: in the seventh year, three thousand and twenty-three Jews: \n 52:29 [hgb] 尼 布 甲 尼 撒 十 八 年 从 耶 路 撒 冷 掳 去 八 百 三 十 二 人 。 \n [kjv] In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons: \n [bbe] And in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he took away as prisoners from Jerusalem eight hundred and thirty-two persons: \n 52:30 [hgb] 尼 布 甲 尼 撒 二 十 三 年 ， 护 卫 长 尼 布 撒 拉 旦 掳 去 犹 大 人 七 百 四 十 五 名 。 共 有 四 千 六 百 人 。 \n [kjv] In the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons: all the persons were four thousand and six hundred. \n [bbe] In the twenty-third year of Nebuchadrezzar, Nebuzaradan, the captain of the armed men, took away as prisoners seven hundred and forty-five of the Jews: all the persons were four thousand and six hundred. \n 52:31 [hgb] 犹 大 王 约 雅 斤 被 掳 后 三 十 七 年 ， 巴 比 伦 王 以 未 米 罗 达 元 年 十 二 月 二 十 五 日 ， 使 犹 大 王 约 雅 斤 抬 头 ， 提 他 出 监 ， \n [kjv] And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Babylon in the first year of his reign lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth out of prison, \n [bbe] And in the thirty-seventh year after Jehoiachin, king of Judah, had been taken prisoner, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-fifth day of the month, Evil-merodach, king of Babylon, in the first year after he became king, took Jehoiachin, king of Judah, out of prison. \n 52:32 [hgb] 又 对 他 说 恩 言 ， 使 他 的 位 高 过 与 他 一 同 在 巴 比 伦 众 王 的 位 ， \n [kjv] And spake kindly unto him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon, \n [bbe] And he said kind words to him and put his seat higher than the seats of the other kings who were with him in Babylon. \n 52:33 [hgb] 给 他 脱 了 囚 服 。 他 终 身 在 巴 比 伦 王 面 前 吃 饭 。 \n [kjv] And changed his prison garments: and he did continually eat bread before him all the days of his life. \n [bbe] And his prison clothing was changed, and he was a guest at the king\u0027s table every day for the rest of his life. \n 52:34 [hgb] 巴 比 伦 王 赐 他 所 需 用 的 食 物 ， 日 日 赐 他 一 分 ， 终 身 是 这 样 ， 直 到 他 死 的 日 子 。 \n [kjv] And for his diet, there was a continual diet given him of the king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of his life. \n [bbe] And for his food, the king gave him a regular amount every day till the day of his death, for the rest of his life. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/128/1963.html","bookId":158,"book":{"id":158,"title":"耶利米书 Jeremiah","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 便 雅 悯 地 亚 拿 突 城 的 祭 司 中 ， 希 勒 家 的 儿 子 耶 利 米 的 话 记 在 下 面 。 [kjv] The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/128","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:20 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
