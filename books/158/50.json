{"id":4551,"no":50,"title":"Chapter 50","content":"50:1 [hgb] 耶 和 华 借 先 知 耶 利 米 论 巴 比 伦 和 迦 勒 底 人 之 地 所 说 的 话 。 \n [kjv] The word that the LORD spake against Babylon and against the land of the Chaldeans by Jeremiah the prophet. \n [bbe] The word which the Lord said about Babylon, about the land of the Chaldaeans, by Jeremiah the prophet. \n 50:2 [hgb] 你 们 要 在 万 国 中 传 扬 报 告 ， 竖 立 大 旗 。 要 报 告 ， 不 可 隐 瞒 ， 说 ， 巴 比 伦 被 攻 取 ， 彼 勒 蒙 羞 ， 米 罗 达 惊 惶 。 巴 比 伦 的 神 像 都 蒙 羞 。 她 的 偶 像 都 惊 惶 。 \n [kjv] Declare ye among the nations, and publish, and set up a standard; publish, and conceal not: say, Babylon is taken, Bel is confounded, Merodach is broken in pieces; her idols are confounded, her images are broken in pieces. \n [bbe] Give it out among the nations, make it public, and let the flag be lifted up; give the word and keep nothing back; say, Babylon is taken, Bel is put to shame, Merodach is broken, her images are put to shame, her gods are broken. \n 50:3 [hgb] 因 有 一 国 从 北 方 上 来 攻 击 她 ， 使 她 的 地 荒 凉 ， 无 人 居 住 ， 连 人 带 牲 畜 都 逃 走 了 。 \n [kjv] For out of the north there cometh up a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein: they shall remove, they shall depart, both man and beast. \n [bbe] For out of the north a nation is coming up against her, which will make her land waste and unpeopled: they are in flight, man and beast are gone. \n 50:4 [hgb] 耶 和 华 说 ， 当 那 日 子 ， 那 时 候 ， 以 色 列 人 要 和 犹 大 人 同 来 ， 随 走 随 哭 ， 寻 求 耶 和 华 他 们 的 神 。 \n [kjv] In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together, going and weeping: they shall go, and seek the LORD their God. \n [bbe] In those days and in that time, says the Lord, the children of Israel will come, they and the children of Judah together; they will go on their way weeping and making prayer to the Lord their God. \n 50:5 [hgb] 他 们 必 访 问 锡 安 ， 又 面 向 这 里 ， 说 ， 来 吧 ， 你 们 要 与 耶 和 华 联 合 为 永 远 不 忘 的 约 。 \n [kjv] They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward, saying, Come, and let us join ourselves to the LORD in a perpetual covenant that shall not be forgotten. \n [bbe] They will be questioning about the way to Zion, with their faces turned in its direction, saying, Come, and be united to the Lord in an eternal agreement which will be kept in mind for ever. \n 50:6 [hgb] 我 的 百 姓 作 了 迷 失 的 羊 ， 牧 人 使 他 们 走 差 路 ， 使 他 们 转 到 山 上 。 他 们 从 大 山 走 到 小 山 ， 竟 忘 了 安 歇 之 处 。 \n [kjv] My people hath been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to go astray, they have turned them away on the mountains: they have gone from mountain to hill, they have forgotten their restingplace. \n [bbe] My people have been wandering sheep: their keepers have made them go out of the right way, turning them loose on the mountains: they have gone from mountain to hill, having no memory of their resting-place. \n 50:7 [hgb] 凡 遇 见 他 们 的 ， 就 把 他 们 吞 灭 。 敌 人 说 ， 我 们 没 有 罪 。 因 他 们 得 罪 那 作 公 义 居 所 的 耶 和 华 ， 就 是 他 们 列 祖 所 仰 望 的 耶 和 华 。 \n [kjv] All that found them have devoured them: and their adversaries said, We offend not, because they have sinned against the LORD, the habitation of justice, even the LORD, the hope of their fathers. \n [bbe] They have been attacked by all those who came across them: and their attackers said, We are doing no wrong, because they have done evil against the Lord in whom is righteousness, against the Lord, the hope of their fathers. \n 50:8 [hgb] 我 民 哪 ， 你 们 要 从 巴 比 伦 中 逃 走 ， 从 迦 勒 底 人 之 地 出 去 ， 要 像 羊 群 前 面 走 的 公 山 羊 。 \n [kjv] Remove out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the he goats before the flocks. \n [bbe] Go in flight out of Babylon, go out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and be like he-goats before the flocks. \n 50:9 [hgb] 因 我 必 激 动 联 合 的 大 国 从 北 方 上 来 攻 击 巴 比 伦 ， 他 们 要 摆 阵 攻 击 她 。 她 必 从 那 里 被 攻 取 。 他 们 的 箭 好 像 善 射 之 勇 士 的 箭 ， 一 枝 也 不 徒 然 返 回 。 \n [kjv] For, lo, I will raise and cause to come up against Babylon an assembly of great nations from the north country: and they shall set themselves in array against her; from thence she shall be taken: their arrows shall be as of a mighty expert man; none shall return in vain. \n [bbe] For see, I am moving and sending up against Babylon a band of great nations from the north country: and they will put their armies in position against her; and from there she will be taken: their arrows will be like those of an expert man of war; not one will come back without getting its mark. \n 50:10 [hgb] 迦 勒 底 必 成 为 掠 物 。 凡 掳 掠 她 的 都 必 心 满 意 足 。 这 是 耶 和 华 说 的 。 \n [kjv] And Chaldea shall be a spoil: all that spoil her shall be satisfied, saith the LORD. \n [bbe] And the wealth of Chaldaea will come into the hands of her attackers: all those who take her wealth will have enough, says the Lord. \n 50:11 [hgb] 抢 夺 我 产 业 的 阿 ， 你 们 因 欢 喜 快 乐 ， 且 像 踹 谷 撒 欢 的 母 牛 犊 ， 又 像 发 嘶 声 的 壮 马 。 \n [kjv] Because ye were glad, because ye rejoiced, O ye destroyers of mine heritage, because ye are grown fat as the heifer at grass, and bellow as bulls; \n [bbe] Because you are glad, because you are lifted up with pride, you wasters of my heritage, because you are playing like a young cow put out to grass, and you make a noise like strong horses; \n 50:12 [hgb] 你 们 的 母 巴 比 伦 就 极 其 抱 愧 ， 生 你 们 的 必 然 蒙 羞 。 她 要 列 在 诸 国 之 末 ， 成 为 旷 野 ， 旱 地 ， 沙 漠 。 \n [kjv] Your mother shall be sore confounded; she that bare you shall be ashamed: behold, the hindermost of the nations shall be a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert. \n [bbe] Your mother will be put to shame; she who gave you birth will be looked down on: see, she will be the last of the nations, a waste place, a dry and unwatered land. \n 50:13 [hgb] 因 耶 和 华 的 忿 怒 ， 必 无 人 居 住 ， 要 全 然 荒 凉 。 凡 经 过 巴 比 伦 的 要 受 惊 骇 ， 又 因 她 所 遭 的 灾 殃 嗤 笑 。 \n [kjv] Because of the wrath of the LORD it shall not be inhabited, but it shall be wholly desolate: every one that goeth by Babylon shall be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues. \n [bbe] Because of the wrath of the Lord no one will be living in it, and it will be quite unpeopled: everyone who goes by Babylon will be overcome with wonder, and make sounds of fear at all her punishments. \n 50:14 [hgb] 所 有 拉 弓 的 ， 你 们 要 在 巴 比 伦 的 四 围 摆 阵 ， 射 箭 攻 击 她 。 不 要 爱 惜 箭 枝 ， 因 她 得 罪 了 耶 和 华 。 \n [kjv] Put yourselves in array against Babylon round about: all ye that bend the bow, shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she hath sinned against the LORD. \n [bbe] Put your armies in position against Babylon on every side, all you bowmen; let loose your arrows at her, not keeping any back: for she has done evil against the Lord. \n 50:15 [hgb] 你 们 要 在 她 四 围 呐 喊 。 她 已 经 投 降 。 外 郭 坍 塌 了 ， 城 墙 拆 毁 了 ， 因 为 这 是 耶 和 华 报 仇 的 事 。 你 们 要 向 巴 比 伦 报 仇 。 她 怎 样 待 人 ， 也 要 怎 样 待 她 。 \n [kjv] Shout against her round about: she hath given her hand: her foundations are fallen, her walls are thrown down: for it is the vengeance of the LORD: take vengeance upon her; as she hath done, do unto her. \n [bbe] Give a loud cry against her on every side; she has given herself up, her supports are overturned, her walls are broken down: for it is the payment taken by the Lord; give her payment; as she has done, so do to her. \n 50:16 [hgb] 你 们 要 将 巴 比 伦 撒 种 的 和 收 割 时 拿 镰 刀 的 都 剪 除 了 。 他 们 各 人 因 怕 欺 压 的 刀 剑 ， 必 归 回 本 族 ， 逃 到 本 土 。 \n [kjv] Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people, and they shall flee every one to his own land. \n [bbe] Let the planter of seed be cut off from Babylon, and everyone using the curved blade at the time of the grain-cutting: for fear of the cruel sword, everyone will be turned to his people, everyone will go in flight to his land. \n 50:17 [hgb] 以 色 列 是 打 散 的 羊 ， 是 被 狮 子 赶 出 的 。 首 先 是 亚 述 王 将 他 吞 灭 ， 末 后 是 巴 比 伦 王 尼 布 甲 尼 撒 将 他 的 骨 头 折 断 。 \n [kjv] Israel is a scattered sheep; the lions have driven him away: first the king of Assyria hath devoured him; and last this Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath broken his bones. \n [bbe] Israel is a wandering sheep; the lions have been driving him away: first he was attacked by the king of Assyria, and now his bones have been broken by Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon. \n 50:18 [hgb] 所 以 万 军 之 耶 和 华 以 色 列 的 神 如 此 说 ， 我 必 罚 巴 比 伦 王 和 他 的 地 ， 像 我 从 前 罚 亚 述 王 一 样 。 \n [kjv] Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have punished the king of Assyria. \n [bbe] So this is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel, has said: See, I will send punishment on the king of Babylon and on his land, as I have given punishment to the king of Assyria. \n 50:19 [hgb] 我 必 再 领 以 色 列 回 他 的 草 场 ， 他 必 在 迦 密 和 巴 珊 吃 草 ， 又 在 以 法 莲 山 上 和 基 列 境 内 得 以 饱 足 。 \n [kjv] And I will bring Israel again to his habitation, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied upon mount Ephraim and Gilead. \n [bbe] And I will make Israel come back to his resting-place, and he will get his food on Carmel and Bashan, and have his desire in full measure on the hills of Ephraim and in Gilead. \n 50:20 [hgb] 耶 和 华 说 ， 当 那 日 子 ， 那 时 候 ， 虽 寻 以 色 列 的 罪 孽 ， 一 无 所 有 。 虽 寻 犹 大 的 罪 恶 ， 也 无 所 见 。 因 为 我 所 留 下 的 人 ， 我 必 赦 免 。 \n [kjv] In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I reserve. \n [bbe] In those days and in that time, says the Lord, when the evil-doing of Israel is looked for, there will be nothing; and in Judah no sins will be seen: for I will have forgiveness for those whom I will keep safe. \n 50:21 [hgb] 耶 和 华 说 ， 上 去 攻 击 米 拉 大 翁 之 地 ， 又 攻 击 比 割 的 居 民 。 要 追 杀 灭 尽 ， 照 我 一 切 所 吩 咐 你 的 去 行 。 \n [kjv] Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod: waste and utterly destroy after them, saith the LORD, and do according to all that I have commanded thee. \n [bbe] Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it, and against the people of Pekod; put them to death and send destruction after them, says the Lord, and do everything I have given you orders to do. \n 50:22 [hgb] 境 内 有 打 仗 和 大 毁 灭 的 响 声 。 \n [kjv] A sound of battle is in the land, and of great destruction. \n [bbe] There is a sound of war in the land and of great destruction. \n 50:23 [hgb] 全 地 的 大 锤 何 竟 砍 断 破 坏 。 巴 比 伦 在 列 国 中 何 竟 荒 凉 。 \n [kjv] How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations! \n [bbe] How is the hammer of all the earth cut in two and broken! how has Babylon become a waste among the nations! \n 50:24 [hgb] 巴 比 伦 哪 ， 我 为 你 设 下 网 罗 ， 你 不 知 不 觉 被 缠 住 。 你 被 寻 着 ， 也 被 捉 住 。 因 为 你 与 耶 和 华 争 竞 。 \n [kjv] I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art also taken, O Babylon, and thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also caught, because thou hast striven against the LORD. \n [bbe] I have put a net for you, and you have been taken, O Babylon, without your knowledge: you have been uncovered and taken because you were fighting against the Lord. \n 50:25 [hgb] 耶 和 华 已 经 开 了 武 库 ， 拿 出 他 恼 恨 的 兵 器 。 因 为 主 万 军 之 耶 和 华 在 迦 勒 底 人 之 地 有 当 作 的 事 。 \n [kjv] The LORD hath opened his armoury, and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation: for this is the work of the Lord GOD of hosts in the land of the Chaldeans. \n [bbe] From his store-house the Lord has taken the instruments of his wrath: for the Lord, the Lord of armies, has a work to do in the land of the Chaldaeans. \n 50:26 [hgb] 你 们 要 从 极 远 的 边 界 来 攻 击 她 ， 开 她 的 仓 廪 ， 将 她 堆 如 高 堆 ， 毁 灭 净 尽 ， 丝 毫 不 留 。 \n [kjv] Come against her from the utmost border, open her storehouses: cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly: let nothing of her be left. \n [bbe] Come up against her one and all, let her store-houses be broken open: make her into a mass of stones, give her to the curse, till there is nothing of her to be seen. \n 50:27 [hgb] 要 杀 她 的 一 切 牛 犊 ， 使 他 们 下 去 遭 遇 杀 戮 。 他 们 有 祸 了 ， 因 为 追 讨 他 们 的 日 子 已 经 来 到 。 \n [kjv] Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe unto them! for their day is come, the time of their visitation. \n [bbe] Put all her oxen to the sword; let them go down to death: sorrow is theirs, for their day has come, the time of their punishment. \n 50:28 [hgb] 有 从 巴 比 伦 之 地 逃 避 出 来 的 人 ， 在 锡 安 扬 声 报 告 耶 和 华 我 们 的 神 报 仇 ， 就 是 为 他 的 殿 报 仇 。 \n [kjv] The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God, the vengeance of his temple. \n [bbe] The voice of those who are in flight, who have got away safe from the land of Babylon, to give news in Zion of punishment from the Lord our God, even payment for his Temple. \n 50:29 [hgb] 招 集 一 切 弓 箭 手 来 攻 击 巴 比 伦 。 要 在 巴 比 伦 四 围 安 营 ， 不 要 容 一 人 逃 脱 ， 照 着 她 所 作 的 报 应 她 。 她 怎 样 待 人 ， 也 要 怎 样 待 她 ， 因 为 她 向 耶 和 华 以 色 列 的 圣 者 发 了 狂 傲 。 \n [kjv] Call together the archers against Babylon: all ye that bend the bow, camp against it round about; let none thereof escape: recompense her according to her work; according to all that she hath done, do unto her: for she hath been proud against the LORD, against the Holy One of Israel. \n [bbe] Send for the archers to come together against Babylon, all the bowmen; put up your tents against her on every side; let no one get away: give her the reward of her work; as she has done, so do to her: for she has been uplifted in pride against the Lord, against the Holy One of Israel. \n 50:30 [hgb] 所 以 她 的 少 年 人 必 仆 倒 在 街 上 。 当 那 日 ， 一 切 兵 丁 必 默 默 无 声 。 这 是 耶 和 华 说 的 。 \n [kjv] Therefore shall her young men fall in the streets, and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD. \n [bbe] For this cause her young men will be falling in her streets, and all her men of war will be cut off in that day, says the Lord. \n 50:31 [hgb] 主 万 军 之 耶 和 华 说 ， 你 这 狂 傲 的 阿 ， 我 与 你 反 对 ， 因 为 我 追 讨 你 的 日 子 已 经 来 到 。 \n [kjv] Behold, I am against thee, O thou most proud, saith the Lord GOD of hosts: for thy day is come, the time that I will visit thee. \n [bbe] See, I am against you, O pride, says the Lord, the Lord of armies, for your day has come, the time when I will send punishment on you. \n 50:32 [hgb] 狂 傲 的 必 绊 跌 仆 倒 ， 无 人 扶 起 。 我 也 必 使 火 在 他 的 城 邑 中 着 起 来 ， 将 他 四 围 所 有 的 尽 行 烧 灭 。 \n [kjv] And the most proud shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up: and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all round about him. \n [bbe] And pride will go with uncertain steps and have a fall, and there will be no one to come to his help: and I will put a fire in his towns, burning up everything round about him. \n 50:33 [hgb] 万 军 之 耶 和 华 如 此 说 ， 以 色 列 人 和 犹 大 人 一 同 受 欺 压 。 凡 掳 掠 他 们 的 都 紧 紧 抓 住 他 们 ， 不 肯 释 放 。 \n [kjv] Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The children of Israel and the children of Judah were oppressed together: and all that took them captives held them fast; they refused to let them go. \n [bbe] This is what the Lord of armies has said: The children of Israel and the children of Judah are crushed down together: all those who took them prisoner keep them in a tight grip; they will not let them go. \n 50:34 [hgb] 他 们 的 救 赎 主 大 有 能 力 ， 万 军 之 耶 和 华 是 他 的 名 。 他 必 伸 清 他 们 的 冤 ， 好 使 全 地 得 平 安 ， 并 搅 扰 巴 比 伦 的 居 民 。 \n [kjv] Their Redeemer is strong; the LORD of hosts is his name: he shall throughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the land, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon. \n [bbe] Their saviour is strong; the Lord of armies is his name: he will certainly take up their cause, so that he may give rest to the earth and trouble to the people of Babylon. \n 50:35 [hgb] 耶 和 华 说 ， 有 刀 剑 临 到 迦 勒 底 人 和 巴 比 伦 的 居 民 ， 并 她 的 首 领 与 智 慧 人 。 \n [kjv] A sword is upon the Chaldeans, saith the LORD, and upon the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her wise men. \n [bbe] A sword is on the Chaldaeans, says the Lord, and on the people of Babylon, and on her rulers and on her wise men. \n 50:36 [hgb] 有 刀 剑 临 到 矜 夸 的 人 ， 他 们 就 成 为 愚 昧 。 有 刀 剑 临 到 她 的 勇 士 ， 他 们 就 惊 惶 。 \n [kjv] A sword is upon the liars; and they shall dote: a sword is upon her mighty men; and they shall be dismayed. \n [bbe] A sword is on the men of pride, and they will become foolish: a sword is on her men of war, and they will be broken. \n 50:37 [hgb] 有 刀 剑 临 到 她 的 马 匹 ， 车 辆 ， 和 其 中 杂 族 的 人 民 。 他 们 必 像 妇 女 一 样 。 有 刀 剑 临 到 她 的 宝 物 ， 就 被 抢 夺 。 \n [kjv] A sword is upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and upon all the mingled people that are in the midst of her; and they shall become as women: a sword is upon her treasures; and they shall be robbed. \n [bbe] A sword is on all the mixed people in her, and they will become like women: a sword is on her store-houses, and they will be taken by her attackers. \n 50:38 [hgb] 有 干 旱 临 到 她 的 众 水 ， 就 必 干 涸 。 因 为 这 是 有 雕 刻 偶 像 之 地 ， 人 因 偶 像 而 颠 狂 。 \n [kjv] A drought is upon her waters; and they shall be dried up: for it is the land of graven images, and they are mad upon their idols. \n [bbe] A sword is on her waters, drying them up; for it is a land of images, and their minds are fixed on false gods. \n 50:39 [hgb] 所 以 旷 野 的 走 兽 和 豺 狼 必 住 在 那 里 ， 鸵 鸟 也 住 在 其 中 ， 永 无 人 烟 ， 世 世 代 代 无 人 居 住 。 \n [kjv] Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts of the islands shall dwell there, and the owls shall dwell therein: and it shall be no more inhabited for ever; neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation. \n [bbe] For this reason the beasts of the waste land with the wolves will make their holes there and the ostriches will be living in it: never again will men be living there, it will be unpeopled from generation to generation. \n 50:40 [hgb] 耶 和 华 说 ， 必 无 人 住 在 那 里 ， 也 无 人 在 其 中 寄 居 ， 要 像 我 倾 覆 所 多 玛 ， 蛾 摩 拉 ， 和 邻 近 的 城 邑 一 样 。 \n [kjv] As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour cities thereof, saith the LORD; so shall no man abide there, neither shall any son of man dwell therein. \n [bbe] As when Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighbouring towns were overturned by God, says the Lord, so no man will be living in it, and no son of man will have a resting-place there. \n 50:41 [hgb] 看 哪 ， 有 一 种 民 从 北 方 而 来 ， 并 有 一 大 国 和 许 多 君 王 被 激 动 ， 从 地 极 来 到 。 \n [kjv] Behold, a people shall come from the north, and a great nation, and many kings shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth. \n [bbe] See, a people is coming from the north; a great nation and a number of kings will be put in motion from the inmost parts of the earth. \n 50:42 [hgb] 他 们 拿 弓 和 枪 ， 性 情 残 忍 ， 不 施 怜 悯 。 他 们 的 声 音 像 海 浪 ？ ？ 訇 。 巴 比 伦 城 （ 城 原 文 作 女 子 ） 阿 ， 他 们 骑 马 ， 都 摆 队 伍 如 上 战 场 的 人 ， 要 攻 击 你 。 \n [kjv] They shall hold the bow and the lance: they are cruel, and will not shew mercy: their voice shall roar like the sea, and they shall ride upon horses, every one put in array, like a man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of Babylon. \n [bbe] Bows and spears are in their hands; they are cruel and have no mercy; their voice is like the thunder of the sea, and they go on horses; everyone in his place like men going to the fight, against you, O daughter of Babylon. \n 50:43 [hgb] 巴 比 伦 王 听 见 他 们 的 风 声 ， 手 就 发 软 ， 痛 苦 将 他 抓 住 ， 疼 痛 仿 佛 产 难 的 妇 人 。 \n [kjv] The king of Babylon hath heard the report of them, and his hands waxed feeble: anguish took hold of him, and pangs as of a woman in travail. \n [bbe] The king of Babylon has had news of them, and his hands have become feeble: trouble has come on him and pain like the pain of a woman in childbirth. \n 50:44 [hgb] 仇 敌 必 像 狮 子 从 约 旦 河 边 的 丛 林 上 来 ， 攻 击 坚 固 的 居 所 。 转 眼 之 间 ， 我 要 使 他 们 逃 跑 ， 离 开 这 地 。 谁 蒙 拣 选 ， 我 就 派 谁 治 理 这 地 。 谁 能 比 我 呢 ？ 谁 能 给 我 定 规 日 期 呢 ？ 有 何 牧 人 能 在 我 面 前 站 立 得 住 呢 ？ \n [kjv] Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan unto the habitation of the strong: but I will make them suddenly run away from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over her? for who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that shepherd that will stand before me? \n [bbe] See, he will come up like a lion from the thick growth of Jordan against the resting-place of Teman: but I will suddenly make them go in flight from her; and I will put over her the man of my selection: for who is like me? and who will put forward his cause against me? and what keeper of sheep will keep his place before me? \n 50:45 [hgb] 你 们 要 听 耶 和 华 攻 击 巴 比 伦 所 说 的 谋 略 和 他 攻 击 迦 勒 底 人 之 地 所 定 的 旨 意 。 仇 敌 定 要 将 他 们 群 众 微 弱 的 拉 去 ， 定 要 使 他 们 的 居 所 荒 凉 。 \n [kjv] Therefore hear ye the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against Babylon; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make their habitation desolate with them. \n [bbe] So give ear to the decision of the Lord which he has made against Babylon, and to his purposes designed against the land of the Chaldaeans; Truly, they will be pulled away by the smallest of the flock; truly, he will make waste their fields with them. \n 50:46 [hgb] 因 巴 比 伦 被 取 的 声 音 ， 地 就 震 动 ， 人 在 列 邦 都 听 见 呼 喊 的 声 音 。 \n [kjv] At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth is moved, and the cry is heard among the nations. \n [bbe] At the cry, Babylon is taken! the earth is shaking, and the cry comes to the ears of the nations. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/128/1961.html","bookId":158,"book":{"id":158,"title":"耶利米书 Jeremiah","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 便 雅 悯 地 亚 拿 突 城 的 祭 司 中 ， 希 勒 家 的 儿 子 耶 利 米 的 话 记 在 下 面 。 [kjv] The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/128","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:20 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
