{"id":4515,"no":14,"title":"Chapter 14","content":"14:1 [hgb] 耶 和 华 论 到 干 旱 之 灾 的 话 临 到 耶 利 米 ， \n [kjv] The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah concerning the dearth. \n [bbe] The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah when there was no water. \n 14:2 [hgb] 犹 大 悲 哀 ， 城 门 衰 败 。 众 人 披 上 黑 衣 坐 在 地 上 。 耶 路 撒 冷 的 哀 声 上 达 。 \n [kjv] Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish; they are black unto the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up. \n [bbe] Judah is weeping and its doors are dark with sorrow, and people are seated on the earth clothed in black; and the cry of Jerusalem has gone up. \n 14:3 [hgb] 他 们 的 贵 胄 打 发 家 僮 打 水 。 他 们 来 到 水 池 ， 见 没 有 水 ， 就 拿 着 空 器 皿 ， 蒙 羞 惭 愧 ， 抱 头 而 回 。 \n [kjv] And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters: they came to the pits, and found no water; they returned with their vessels empty; they were ashamed and confounded, and covered their heads. \n [bbe] Their great men have sent their servants for water: they come to the holes and there is no water to be seen; they come back with nothing in their vessels; they are overcome with shame and fear, covering their heads. \n 14:4 [hgb] 耕 地 的 也 蒙 羞 抱 头 。 因 为 无 雨 降 在 地 上 ， 地 都 干 裂 。 \n [kjv] Because the ground is chapt, for there was no rain in the earth, the plowmen were ashamed, they covered their heads. \n [bbe] Those who do work on the land are in fear, for there has been no rain on the land, and the farmers are shamed, covering their heads. \n 14:5 [hgb] 田 野 的 母 鹿 生 下 小 鹿 ， 就 撇 弃 ， 因 为 无 草 。 \n [kjv] Yea, the hind also calved in the field, and forsook it, because there was no grass. \n [bbe] And the roe, giving birth in the field, lets her young one be uncared for, because there is no grass. \n 14:6 [hgb] 野 驴 站 在 净 光 的 高 处 ， 喘 气 好 像 野 狗 。 因 为 无 草 ， 眼 目 失 明 。 \n [kjv] And the wild asses did stand in the high places, they snuffed up the wind like dragons; their eyes did fail, because there was no grass. \n [bbe] And the asses of the field on the open hilltops are opening their mouths wide like jackals to get air; their eyes are hollow because there is no grass. \n 14:7 [hgb] 耶 和 华 阿 ， 我 们 的 罪 孽 虽 然 作 见 证 告 我 们 ， 还 求 你 为 你 名 的 缘 故 行 事 。 我 们 本 是 多 次 背 道 ， 得 罪 了 你 。 \n [kjv] O LORD, though our iniquities testify against us, do thou it for thy name\u0027s sake: for our backslidings are many; we have sinned against thee. \n [bbe] Though our sins give witness against us, do something, O Lord, for the honour of your name: for again and again we have been turned away from you, we have done evil against you. \n 14:8 [hgb] 以 色 列 所 盼 望 ， 在 患 难 时 作 他 救 主 的 阿 ， 你 为 何 在 这 地 像 寄 居 的 ， 又 像 行 路 的 只 住 一 宵 呢 ？ \n [kjv] O the hope of Israel, the saviour thereof in time of trouble, why shouldest thou be as a stranger in the land, and as a wayfaring man that turneth aside to tarry for a night? \n [bbe] O you hope of Israel, its saviour in time of trouble, why are you like one who is strange in the land, and like a traveller putting up his tent for a night? \n 14:9 [hgb] 你 为 何 像 受 惊 的 人 ， 像 不 能 救 人 的 勇 士 呢 ？ 耶 和 华 阿 ， 你 仍 在 我 们 中 间 。 我 们 也 称 为 你 名 下 的 人 ， 求 你 不 要 离 开 我 们 。 \n [kjv] Why shouldest thou be as a man astonied, as a mighty man that cannot save? yet thou, O LORD, art in the midst of us, and we are called by thy name; leave us not. \n [bbe] Why are you like a man surprised, like a man of war who is not able to give help? but you, O Lord, are with us, and we are named by your name; do not go away from us. \n 14:10 [hgb] 耶 和 华 对 这 百 姓 如 此 说 ， 这 百 姓 喜 爱 妄 行 （ 原 文 作 飘 流 ） ， 不 禁 止 脚 步 ， 所 以 耶 和 华 不 悦 纳 他 们 。 现 今 要 记 念 他 们 的 罪 孽 ， 追 讨 他 们 的 罪 恶 。 \n [kjv] Thus saith the LORD unto this people, Thus have they loved to wander, they have not refrained their feet, therefore the LORD doth not accept them; he will now remember their iniquity, and visit their sins. \n [bbe] This is what the Lord has said about this people: Even so they have been glad to go from the right way; they have not kept their feet from wandering, so the Lord has no pleasure in them; now he will keep their wrongdoing in mind and send punishment for their sins. \n 14:11 [hgb] 耶 和 华 又 对 我 说 ， 不 要 为 这 百 姓 祈 祷 求 好 处 。 \n [kjv] Then said the LORD unto me, Pray not for this people for their good. \n [bbe] And the Lord said to me, Make no prayer for this people for their good. \n 14:12 [hgb] 他 们 禁 食 的 时 候 ， 我 不 听 他 们 的 呼 求 。 他 们 献 燔 祭 和 素 祭 ， 我 也 不 悦 纳 。 我 却 要 用 刀 剑 ， 饥 荒 ， 瘟 疫 灭 绝 他 们 。 \n [kjv] When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt offering and an oblation, I will not accept them: but I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence. \n [bbe] When they go without food, I will not give ear to their cry; when they give burned offerings and meal offerings, I will not take pleasure in them: but I will put an end to them by the sword and by need of food and by disease. \n 14:13 [hgb] 我 就 说 ， 唉 。 主 耶 和 华 阿 ， 那 些 先 知 常 对 他 们 说 ， 你 们 必 不 看 见 刀 剑 ， 也 不 遭 遇 饥 荒 。 耶 和 华 要 在 这 地 方 赐 你 们 长 久 的 平 安 。 \n [kjv] Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, the prophets say unto them, Ye shall not see the sword, neither shall ye have famine; but I will give you assured peace in this place. \n [bbe] Then I said, Ah, Lord God! see, the prophets say to them, You will not see the sword or be short of food; but I will give you certain peace in this place. \n 14:14 [hgb] 耶 和 华 对 我 说 ， 那 些 先 知 托 我 的 名 说 假 预 言 ， 我 并 没 有 打 发 他 们 ， 没 有 吩 咐 他 们 ， 也 没 有 对 他 们 说 话 。 他 们 向 你 们 预 言 的 ， 乃 是 虚 假 的 异 象 和 占 卜 ， 并 虚 无 的 事 ， 以 及 本 心 的 诡 诈 。 \n [kjv] Then the LORD said unto me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name: I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, neither spake unto them: they prophesy unto you a false vision and divination, and a thing of nought, and the deceit of their heart. \n [bbe] Then the Lord said to me, The prophets say false words in my name, and I gave them no orders, and I said nothing to them: what they say to you is a false vision and wonder-working words without substance, the deceit of their hearts. \n 14:15 [hgb] 所 以 耶 和 华 如 此 说 ， 论 到 托 我 名 说 预 言 的 那 些 先 知 ， 我 并 没 有 打 发 他 们 。 他 们 还 说 这 地 不 能 有 刀 剑 饥 荒 ， 其 实 那 些 先 知 必 被 刀 剑 饥 荒 灭 绝 。 \n [kjv] Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name, and I sent them not, yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be in this land; By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed. \n [bbe] So this is what the Lord has said about the prophets who make use of my name, though I sent them not, and say, The sword and need of food will not be in this land: the sword and need of food will put an end to those prophets. \n 14:16 [hgb] 听 他 们 说 预 言 的 百 姓 必 因 饥 荒 刀 剑 抛 在 耶 路 撒 冷 的 街 道 上 ， 无 人 葬 埋 。 他 们 连 妻 子 带 儿 女 ， 都 是 如 此 。 我 必 将 他 们 的 恶 倒 在 他 们 身 上 （ 或 作 我 必 使 他 们 罪 恶 的 报 应 临 到 他 们 身 上 ） 。 \n [kjv] And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and they shall have none to bury them, them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters: for I will pour their wickedness upon them. \n [bbe] And the people to whom they are prophets will be pushed out dead into the streets of Jerusalem, because there is no food, and because of the sword; and they will have no one to put their bodies into the earth, them or their wives or their sons or their daughters: for I will let loose their evil-doing on them. \n 14:17 [hgb] 你 要 将 这 话 对 他 们 说 ， 愿 我 眼 泪 汪 汪 ， 昼 夜 不 息 ， 因 为 我 百 姓 （ 原 文 作 民 的 处 女 ） 受 了 裂 口 破 坏 的 大 伤 。 \n [kjv] Therefore thou shalt say this word unto them; Let mine eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease: for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous blow. \n [bbe] And you are to say this word to them, Let my eyes be streaming with water night and day, and let it not be stopped; for the virgin daughter of my people is wounded with a great wound, with a very bitter blow. \n 14:18 [hgb] 我 若 出 往 田 间 ， 就 见 有 被 刀 杀 的 。 我 若 进 入 城 内 ， 就 见 有 因 饥 荒 患 病 的 。 连 先 知 带 祭 司 在 国 中 往 来 ， 也 是 毫 无 知 识 （ 或 作 不 知 怎 样 才 好 ） 。 \n [kjv] If I go forth into the field, then behold the slain with the sword! and if I enter into the city, then behold them that are sick with famine! yea, both the prophet and the priest go about into a land that they know not. \n [bbe] If I go out into the open country, there are those put to death by the sword! and if I go into the town, there are those who are diseased from need of food! for the prophet and the priest go about in the land and have no knowledge. \n 14:19 [hgb] 你 全 然 弃 掉 犹 大 吗 ？ 你 心 厌 恶 锡 安 吗 ？ 为 何 击 打 我 们 ， 以 致 无 法 医 治 呢 ？ 我 们 指 望 平 安 ， 却 得 不 着 好 处 。 指 望 痊 愈 ， 不 料 ， 受 了 惊 惶 。 \n [kjv] Hast thou utterly rejected Judah? hath thy soul lothed Zion? why hast thou smitten us, and there is no healing for us? we looked for peace, and there is no good; and for the time of healing, and behold trouble! \n [bbe] Have you completely given up Judah? is your soul turned in disgust from Zion? why have you given us blows from which there is no one to make us well? we were looking for peace, but no good came; and for a time of well-being, but there was only a great fear. \n 14:20 [hgb] 耶 和 华 阿 ， 我 们 承 认 自 己 的 罪 恶 ， 和 我 们 列 祖 的 罪 孽 ， 因 我 们 得 罪 了 你 。 \n [kjv] We acknowledge, O LORD, our wickedness, and the iniquity of our fathers: for we have sinned against thee. \n [bbe] We are conscious, O Lord, of our sin and of the wrongdoing of our fathers: we have done evil against you. \n 14:21 [hgb] 求 你 为 你 名 的 缘 故 ， 不 厌 恶 我 们 ， 不 辱 没 你 荣 耀 的 宝 座 。 求 你 追 念 ， 不 要 背 了 与 我 们 所 立 的 约 。 \n [kjv] Do not abhor us, for thy name\u0027s sake, do not disgrace the throne of thy glory: remember, break not thy covenant with us. \n [bbe] Do not be turned from us in disgust, because of your name; do not put shame on the seat of your glory: keep us in mind, let not your agreement with us be broken. \n 14:22 [hgb] 外 邦 人 虚 无 的 神 中 有 能 降 雨 的 吗 ？ 天 能 自 降 甘 霖 吗 ？ 耶 和 华 我 们 的 神 阿 ， 能 如 此 的 不 是 你 吗 ？ 所 以 ， 我 们 仍 要 等 候 你 ， 因 为 这 一 切 都 是 你 所 造 的 。 \n [kjv] Are there any among the vanities of the Gentiles that can cause rain? or can the heavens give showers? art not thou he, O LORD our God? therefore we will wait upon thee: for thou hast made all these things. \n [bbe] Are any of the false gods of the nations able to make rain come? are the heavens able to give showers? are you not he, O Lord our God? so we will go on waiting for you, for you have done all these things. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/128/1925.html","bookId":158,"book":{"id":158,"title":"耶利米书 Jeremiah","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 便 雅 悯 地 亚 拿 突 城 的 祭 司 中 ， 希 勒 家 的 儿 子 耶 利 米 的 话 记 在 下 面 。 [kjv] The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/128","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:20 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
