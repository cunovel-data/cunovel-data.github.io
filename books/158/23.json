My heart is broken in me, all my bones are shaking; I am like a man full of strong drink, like a man overcome by wine; because of the Lord, and because of his holy words. \n 23:10 [hgb] 地 满 了 行 淫 的 人 。 因 妄 自 赌 咒 ， 地 就 悲 哀 。 旷 野 的 草 场 都 枯 干 了 。 他 们 所 行 的 道 乃 是 恶 的 。 他 们 的 勇 力 使 得 不 正 。 \n [kjv] For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing the land mourneth; the pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up, and their course is evil, and their force is not right. \n [bbe] For the land is full of men who are untrue to their wives; because of the curse the land is full of grief; the green fields of the waste land have become dry; and they are quick to do evil, their strength is for what is not right. \n 23:11 [hgb] 连 先 知 带 祭 司 都 是 亵 渎 的 ， 就 是 在 我 殿 中 我 也 看 见 他 们 的 恶 。 这 是 耶 和 华 说 的 。 \n [kjv] For both prophet and priest are profane; yea, in my house have I found their wickedness, saith the LORD. \n [bbe] For the prophet as well as the priest is unclean; even in my house I have seen their evil-doing, says the Lord. \n 23:12 [hgb] 因 此 ， 他 们 的 道 路 必 像 黑 暗 中 的 滑 地 ， 他 们 必 被 追 赶 ， 在 这 路 中 仆 倒 。 因 为 当 追 讨 之 年 ， 我 必 使 灾 祸 临 到 他 们 。 这 是 耶 和 华 说 的 。 \n [kjv] Wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery ways in the darkness: they shall be driven on, and fall therein: for I will bring evil upon them, even the year of their visitation, saith the LORD. \n [bbe] For this cause their steps will be slipping on their way: they will be forced on into the dark and have a fall there: for I will send evil on them in the year of their punishment, says the Lord. \n 23:13 [hgb] 我 在 撒 玛 利 亚 的 先 知 中 曾 见 愚 妄 。 他 们 借 巴 力 说 预 言 ， 使 我 的 百 姓 以 色 列 走 错 了 路 。 \n [kjv] And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophesied in Baal, and caused my people Israel to err. \n [bbe] And I have seen ways without sense in the prophets of Samaria; they became prophets of the Baal, causing my people Israel to go wrong. \n 23:14 [hgb] 我 在 耶 路 撒 冷 的 先 知 中 曾 见 可 憎 恶 的 事 。 他 们 行 奸 淫 ， 作 事 虚 妄 ， 又 坚 固 恶 人 的 手 ， 甚 至 无 人 回 头 离 开 他 的 恶 。 他 们 在 我 面 前 都 像 所 多 玛 。 耶 路 撒 冷 的 居 民 都 像 蛾 摩 拉 。 \n [kjv] I have seen also in the prophets of Jerusalem an horrible thing: they commit adultery, and walk in lies: they strengthen also the hands of evildoers, that none doth return from his wickedness: they are all of them unto me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah. \n [bbe] And in the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen a shocking thing; they are untrue to their wives, walking in deceit, and they make strong the hands of evil-doers, so that a man may not be turned back from his evil-doing: they have all become like Sodom to me, and its people like Gomorrah. \n 23:15 [hgb] 所 以 万 军 之 耶 和 华 论 到 先 知 如 此 说 ， 我 必 将 茵 陈 给 他 们 吃 ， 又 将 苦 胆 水 给 他 们 喝 。 因 为 亵 渎 的 事 出 于 耶 路 撒 冷 的 先 知 ， 流 行 遍 地 。 \n [kjv] Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets; Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drink the water of gall: for from the prophets of Jerusalem is profaneness gone forth into all the land. \n [bbe] So this is what the Lord of armies has said about the prophets: See, I will give them a bitter plant for their food, and bitter water for their drink: for from the prophets of Jerusalem unclean behaviour has gone out into all the land. \n 23:16 [hgb] 万 军 之 耶 和 华 如 此 说 ， 这 些 先 知 向 你 们 说 预 言 ， 你 们 不 要 听 他 们 的 话 。 他 们 以 虚 空 教 训 你 们 ， 所 说 的 异 象 是 出 于 自 己 的 心 ， 不 是 出 于 耶 和 华 的 口 。 \n [kjv] Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Hearken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you: they make you vain: they speak a vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of the LORD. \n [bbe] This is what the Lord of armies has said: Do not give ear to the words which the prophets say to you: they give you teaching of no value: it is from themselves that their vision comes, and not out of the mouth of the Lord. \n 23:17 [hgb] 他 们 常 对 藐 视 我 的 人 说 ， 耶 和 华 说 ， 你 们 必 享 平 安 。 又 对 一 切 按 自 己 顽 梗 之 心 而 行 的 人 说 ， 必 没 有 灾 祸 临 到 你 们 。 \n [kjv] They say still unto them that despise me, The LORD hath said, Ye shall have peace; and they say unto every one that walketh after the imagination of his own heart, No evil shall come upon you. \n [bbe] They keep on saying to those who have no respect for the word of the Lord, You will have peace; and to everyone who goes on his way in the pride of his heart, they say, No evil will come to you. \n 23:18 [hgb] 有 谁 站 在 耶 和 华 的 会 中 得 以 听 见 并 会 悟 他 的 话 呢 ？ 有 谁 留 心 听 他 的 话 呢 ？ \n [kjv] For who hath stood in the counsel of the LORD, and hath perceived and heard his word? who hath marked his word, and heard it? \n [bbe] For which of them has knowledge of the secret of the Lord, and has seen him, and given ear to his word? which of them has taken note of his word and given attention to it? \n 23:19 [hgb] 看 哪 。 耶 和 华 的 忿 怒 好 像 暴 风 ， 已 经 发 出 。 是 暴 烈 的 旋 风 ， 必 转 到 恶 人 的 头 上 。 \n [kjv] Behold, a whirlwind of the LORD is gone forth in fury, even a grievous whirlwind: it shall fall grievously upon the head of the wicked. \n [bbe] See, the storm-wind of the Lord, even the heat of his wrath, has gone out, a rolling storm, bursting on the heads of the evil-doers. \n 23:20 [hgb] 耶 和 华 的 怒 气 必 不 转 消 ， 直 到 他 心 中 所 拟 定 的 成 就 了 。 末 后 的 日 子 你 们 要 全 然 明 白 。 \n [kjv] The anger of the LORD shall not return, until he have executed, and till he have performed the thoughts of his heart: in the latter days ye shall consider it perfectly. \n [bbe] The wrath of the Lord will not be turned back till he has done, till he has put into effect, the purposes of his heart: in days to come you will have full knowledge of this. \n 23:21 [hgb] 我 没 有 打 发 那 些 先 知 ， 他 们 竟 自 奔 跑 。 我 没 有 对 他 们 说 话 ， 他 们 竟 自 预 言 。 \n [kjv] I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran: I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied. \n [bbe] I did not send these prophets, but they went running: I said nothing to them, but they gave out the prophet\u0027s word. \n 23:22 [hgb] 他 们 若 是 站 在 我 的 会 中 ， 就 必 使 我 的 百 姓 听 我 的 话 ， 又 使 他 们 回 头 离 开 恶 道 和 他 们 所 行 的 恶 。 \n [kjv] But if they had stood in my counsel, and had caused my people to hear my words, then they should have turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings. \n [bbe] But if they had been in my secret, then they would have made my people give ear to my words, turning them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings. \n 23:23 [hgb] 耶 和 华 说 ， 我 岂 为 近 处 的 神 呢 ？ 不 也 为 远 处 的 神 吗 ？ \n [kjv] Am I a God at hand, saith the LORD, and not a God afar off? \n [bbe] Am I only a God who is near, says the Lord, and not a God at a distance? \n 23:24 [hgb] 耶 和 华 说 ， 人 岂 能 在 隐 密 处 藏 身 ， 使 我 看 不 见 他 呢 ？ 耶 和 华 说 ， 我 岂 不 充 满 天 地 吗 ？ \n [kjv] Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him? saith the LORD. Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith the LORD. \n [bbe] In what secret place may a man take cover without my seeing him? says the Lord. Is there any place in heaven or earth where I am not? says the Lord. \n 23:25 [hgb] 我 已 听 见 那 些 先 知 所 说 的 ， 就 是 托 我 名 说 的 假 预 言 ， 他 们 说 ， 我 作 了 梦 。 我 作 了 梦 。 \n [kjv] I have heard what the prophets said, that prophesy lies in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed. \n [bbe] My ears have been open to what the prophets have said, who say false words in my name, saying, I have had a dream, I have had a dream, I have had a dream, \n 23:26 [hgb] 说 假 预 言 的 先 知 ， 就 是 预 言 本 心 诡 诈 的 先 知 ， 他 们 这 样 存 心 要 到 几 时 呢 ？ \n [kjv] How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies? yea, they are prophets of the deceit of their own heart; \n [bbe] Is (my word) in the hearts of the prophets who give out false words, even the prophets of the deceit of their hearts? \n 23:27 [hgb] 他 们 各 人 将 所 作 的 梦 对 邻 舍 述 说 ， 想 要 使 我 的 百 姓 忘 记 我 的 名 ， 正 如 他 们 列 祖 因 巴 力 忘 记 我 的 名 一 样 。 \n [kjv] Which think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour, as their fathers have forgotten my name for Baal. \n [bbe] Whose purpose is to take away the memory of my name from my people by their dreams, of which every man is talking to his neighbour, as their fathers gave up the memory of my name for the Baal. \n 23:28 [hgb] 得 梦 的 先 知 可 以 述 说 那 梦 。 得 我 话 的 人 可 以 诚 实 讲 说 我 的 话 。 糠 秕 怎 能 与 麦 子 比 较 呢 ？ 这 是 耶 和 华 说 的 。 \n [kjv] The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that hath my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What is the chaff to the wheat? saith the LORD. \n [bbe] If a prophet has a dream, let him give out his dream; and he who has my word, let him give out my word in good faith. What has the dry stem to do with the grain? says the Lord. \n 23:29 [hgb] 耶 和 华 说 ， 我 的 话 岂 不 像 火 ， 又 像 能 打 碎 磐 石 的 大 锤 吗 ？ \n [kjv] Is not my word like as a fire? saith the LORD; and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces? \n [bbe] Is not my word like fire? says the Lord; and like a hammer, smashing the rock to bits? \n 23:30 [hgb] 耶 和 华 说 ， 那 些 先 知 各 从 邻 舍 偷 窃 我 的 言 语 ， 因 此 我 必 与 他 们 反 对 。 \n [kjv] Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, saith the LORD, that steal my words every one from his neighbour. \n [bbe] For this cause I am against the prophets, says the Lord, who take my words, every one from his neighbour. \n 23:31 [hgb] 耶 和 华 说 ， 那 些 先 知 用 舌 头 ， 说 是 耶 和 华 说 的 。 我 必 与 他 们 反 对 。 \n [kjv] Behold, I am against the prophets, saith the LORD, that use their tongues, and say, He saith. \n [bbe] See, I am against the prophets, says the Lord, who let their tongues say, He has said. \n 23:32 [hgb] 耶 和 华 说 ， 那 些 以 幻 梦 为 预 言 ， 又 述 说 这 梦 ， 以 谎 言 和 矜 夸 使 我 百 姓 走 错 了 路 的 ， 我 必 与 他 们 反 对 。 我 没 有 打 发 他 们 ， 也 没 有 吩 咐 他 们 。 他 们 与 这 百 姓 毫 无 益 处 。 这 是 耶 和 华 说 的 。 \n [kjv] Behold, I am against them that prophesy false dreams, saith the LORD, and do tell them, and cause my people to err by their lies, and by their lightness; yet I sent them not, nor commanded them: therefore they shall not profit this people at all, saith the LORD. \n [bbe] See, I am against the prophets of false dreams, says the Lord, who give them out and make my people go out of the way by their deceit and their uncontrolled words: but I did not send them or give them orders; and they will be of no profit to this people, says the Lord. \n 23:33 [hgb] 无 论 是 百 姓 ， 是 先 知 ， 是 祭 司 ， 问 你 说 ， 耶 和 华 有 什 么 默 示 呢 ？ 你 就 对 他 们 说 ， 什 么 默 示 阿 。 耶 和 华 说 ， 我 要 撇 弃 你 们 。 \n [kjv] And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask thee, saying, What is the burden of the LORD? thou shalt then say unto them, What burden? I will even forsake you, saith the LORD. \n [bbe] And if this people, or the prophet, or a priest, questioning you, says, What word of weight is there from the Lord? then you are to say to them, You are the word, for I will not be troubled with you any more, says the Lord. \n 23:34 [hgb] 无 论 是 先 知 ， 是 祭 司 ， 是 百 姓 ， 说 耶 和 华 的 默 示 ， 我 必 刑 罚 那 人 和 他 的 家 。 \n [kjv] And as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people, that shall say, The burden of the LORD, I will even punish that man and his house. \n [bbe] And as for the prophet and the priest and the people who say, A word of weight from the Lord! I will send punishment on that man and on his house. \n 23:35 [hgb] 你 们 各 人 要 对 邻 舍 ， 各 人 要 对 弟 兄 如 此 说 ， 耶 和 华 回 答 什 么 ？ 耶 和 华 说 了 什 么 呢 ？ \n [kjv] Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour, and every one to his brother, What hath the LORD answered? and, What hath the LORD spoken? \n [bbe] But this is what you are to say, every man to his neighbour and every man to his brother, What answer has the Lord given? and, What has the Lord said? \n 23:36 [hgb] 耶 和 华 的 默 示 你 们 不 可 再 提 ， 各 人 所 说 的 话 必 作 自 己 的 重 担 （ 重 担 和 默 示 原 文 同 ） ， 因 为 你 们 谬 用 永 生 神 ， 万 军 之 耶 和 华 我 们 神 的 言 语 。 \n [kjv] And the burden of the LORD shall ye mention no more: for every man\u0027s word shall be his burden; for ye have perverted the words of the living God, of the LORD of hosts our God. \n [bbe] And you will no longer put people in mind of the word of weight of the Lord: for every man\u0027s word will be a weight on himself; for the words of the living God, of the Lord of armies, our God, have been twisted by you. \n 23:37 [hgb] 你 们 要 对 先 知 如 此 说 ， 耶 和 华 回 答 你 什 么 。 耶 和 华 说 了 什 么 呢 ？ \n [kjv] Thus shalt thou say to the prophet, What hath the LORD answered thee? and, What hath the LORD spoken? \n [bbe] This is what you are to say to the prophet, What answer has the Lord given to you? and, What has the Lord said? \n 23:38 [hgb] 你 们 若 说 耶 和 华 的 默 示 ， 耶 和 华 就 如 此 说 ， 因 你 们 说 耶 和 华 的 默 示 这 句 话 ， 我 也 打 发 人 到 你 们 那 里 去 ， 告 诉 你 们 不 可 说 耶 和 华 的 默 示 。 \n [kjv] But since ye say, The burden of the LORD; therefore thus saith the LORD; Because ye say this word, The burden of the LORD, and I have sent unto you, saying, Ye shall not say, The burden of the LORD; \n [bbe] But if you say, The word of weight of the Lord; this is what the Lord has said: Because you say, The weight of the Lord, and I have sent to you, saying, You are not to say, The weight of the Lord; \n 23:39 [hgb] 所 以 我 必 全 然 忘 记 你 们 ， 将 你 们 和 我 所 赐 给 你 们 并 你 们 列 祖 的 城 撇 弃 了 。 \n [kjv] Therefore, behold, I, even I, will utterly forget you, and I will forsake you, and the city that I gave you and your fathers, and cast you out of my presence: \n [bbe] For this reason, truly, I will put you completely out of my memory, and I will put you, and the town which I gave to you and to your fathers, away from before my face: \n 23:40 [hgb] 又 必 使 永 远 的 凌 辱 和 长 久 的 羞 耻 临 到 你 们 ， 是 不 能 忘 记 的 。 \n [kjv] And I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten. \n [bbe] And I will give you a name without honour for ever, and unending shame which will never go from the memory of men. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/128/1934.html","bookId":158,"book":{"id":158,"title":"耶利米书 Jeremiah","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 便 雅 悯 地 亚 拿 突 城 的 祭 司 中 ， 希 勒 家 的 儿 子 耶 利 米 的 话 记 在 下 面 。 [kjv] The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/128","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:20 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
