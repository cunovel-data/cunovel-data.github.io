{"id":4513,"no":12,"title":"Chapter 12","content":"12:1 [hgb] 耶 和 华 阿 ， 我 与 你 争 辩 的 时 候 ， 你 显 为 义 。 但 有 一 件 ， 我 还 要 与 你 理 论 ， 恶 人 的 道 路 为 何 亨 通 呢 ？ 大 行 诡 诈 的 为 何 得 安 逸 呢 ？ [kjv] Righteous art thou, O LORD, when I plead with thee: yet let me talk with thee of thy judgments: Wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper? wherefore are all they happy that deal very treacherously? [bbe] You are in the right, O Lord, when I put my cause before you: still let me take up with you the question of your decisions: why does the evil-doer do well? why are the workers of deceit living in comfort? 12:2 [hgb] 你 栽 培 了 他 们 ， 他 们 也 扎 了 根 ， 长 大 ， 而 且 结 果 。 他 们 的 口 是 与 你 相 近 ， 心 却 与 你 远 离 。 [kjv] Thou hast planted them, yea, they have taken root: they grow, yea, they bring forth fruit: thou art near in their mouth, and far from their reins. [bbe] They have been planted by you, they have taken root; they go on and give fruit: you are near in their mouths but far from their thoughts. 12:3 [hgb] 耶 和 华 阿 ， 你 晓 得 我 ， 看 见 我 ， 察 验 我 向 你 是 怎 样 的 心 。 求 你 将 他 们 拉 出 来 ， 好 像 将 宰 的 羊 ， 叫 他 们 等 候 杀 戮 的 日 子 。 [kjv] But thou, O LORD, knowest me: thou hast seen me, and tried mine heart toward thee: pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter. [bbe] But you, O Lord, have knowledge of me; you see me, searching and testing how my heart is with you: let them be pulled out like sheep to be put to death, make them ready for the day of death. 12:4 [hgb] 这 地 悲 哀 ， 通 国 的 青 草 枯 干 ， 要 到 几 时 呢 ？ 因 其 上 居 民 的 恶 行 ， 牲 畜 和 飞 鸟 都 灭 绝 了 。 他 们 曾 说 ， 他 看 不 见 我 们 的 结 局 。 [kjv] How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of every field wither, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein? the beasts are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He shall not see our last end. [bbe] How long will the land have grief, and the plants of all the land be dry? because of the sins of the people living in it, destruction has overtaken the beasts and the birds; because they said, God does not see our ways. 12:5 [hgb] 耶 和 华 说 ， 你 若 与 步 行 的 人 同 跑 ， 尚 且 觉 累 ， 怎 能 与 马 赛 跑 呢 ？ 你 在 平 安 之 地 ， 虽 然 安 稳 ， 在 约 旦 河 边 的 丛 林 要 怎 样 行 呢 ？ [kjv] If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how canst thou contend with horses? and if in the land of peace, wherein thou trustedst, they wearied thee, then how wilt thou do in the swelling of Jordan? [bbe] If running with the fighting-men has made you tired, how will you be able to keep up with horses? and if in a land of peace you go in flight, what will become of you in the thick growth of Jordan? 12:6 [hgb] 因 为 连 你 弟 兄 和 你 父 家 都 用 奸 诈 待 你 。 他 们 也 在 你 后 边 大 声 喊 叫 ， 虽 向 你 说 好 话 ， 你 也 不 要 信 他 们 。 [kjv] For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have dealt treacherously with thee; yea, they have called a multitude after thee: believe them not, though they speak fair words unto thee. [bbe] For even your brothers, your father\u0027s family, even they have been untrue to you, crying loudly after you: have no faith in them, though they say fair words to you. 12:7 [hgb] 我 离 了 我 的 殿 宇 ， 撇 弃 我 的 产 业 ， 将 我 心 里 所 亲 爱 的 交 在 她 仇 敌 的 手 中 。 [kjv] I have forsaken mine house, I have left mine heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies. [bbe] I have given up my house, I have let my heritage go; I have given the loved one of my soul into the hands of her haters. 12:8 [hgb] 我 的 产 业 向 我 如 林 中 的 狮 子 ， 她 发 声 攻 击 我 ， 因 此 我 恨 恶 她 。 [kjv] Mine heritage is unto me as a lion in the forest; it crieth out against me: therefore have I hated it. [bbe] My heritage has become like a lion in the woodland to me; her voice has been loud against me; so I have hate for her. 12:9 [hgb] 我 的 产 业 向 我 岂 如 斑 点 的 鸷 鸟 呢 ？ 鸷 鸟 岂 在 她 四 围 攻 击 她 呢 ？ 你 们 要 去 聚 集 田 野 的 百 兽 ， 带 来 吞 吃 吧 。 [kjv] Mine heritage is unto me as a speckled bird, the birds round about are against her; come ye, assemble all the beasts of the field, come to devour. [bbe] My heritage is like a brightly coloured bird to me; the cruel birds are attacking her on every side: go, get together all the beasts of the field, make them come for destruction. 12:10 [hgb] 许 多 牧 人 毁 坏 我 的 葡 萄 园 ， 践 踏 我 的 分 ， 使 我 美 好 的 分 变 为 荒 凉 的 旷 野 。 [kjv] Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness. [bbe] The keepers of sheep have been the destruction of my vine-garden, crushing my heritage under their feet; they have made my fair heritage an unplanted waste; 12:11 [hgb] 他 们 使 地 荒 凉 。 地 既 荒 凉 ， 便 向 我 悲 哀 。 全 地 荒 凉 ， 因 无 人 介 意 。 [kjv] They have made it desolate, and being desolate it mourneth unto me; the whole land is made desolate, because no man layeth it to heart. [bbe] They have made it waste; it is weeping to me, being wasted; all the land is made waste, because no man takes it to heart. 12:12 [hgb] 灭 命 的 都 来 到 旷 野 中 一 切 净 光 的 高 处 。 耶 和 华 的 刀 从 地 这 边 直 到 地 那 边 尽 行 杀 灭 。 凡 有 血 气 的 都 不 得 平 安 。 [kjv] The spoilers are come upon all high places through the wilderness: for the sword of the LORD shall devour from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land: no flesh shall have peace. [bbe] Those who make waste have come on all the open hilltops in the waste land; for the sword of the Lord sends destruction from one end of the land to the other end of the land: no flesh has peace. 12:13 [hgb] 他 们 种 的 是 麦 子 ， 收 的 是 荆 棘 。 劳 劳 苦 苦 却 毫 无 益 处 。 因 耶 和 华 的 烈 怒 ， 你 们 必 为 自 己 的 土 产 羞 愧 。 [kjv] They have sown wheat, but shall reap thorns: they have put themselves to pain, but shall not profit: and they shall be ashamed of your revenues because of the fierce anger of the LORD. [bbe] Though good grain was planted, they have got in thorns: they have given themselves pain without profit: they will be shamed on account of their produce, because of the burning wrath of the Lord. 12:14 [hgb] 耶 和 华 如 此 说 ， 一 切 恶 邻 ， 就 是 占 据 我 使 百 姓 以 色 列 所 承 受 产 业 的 ， 我 要 将 他 们 拔 出 本 地 ， 又 要 将 犹 大 家 从 他 们 中 间 拔 出 来 。 [kjv] Thus saith the LORD against all mine evil neighbours, that touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit; Behold, I will pluck them out of their land, and pluck out the house of Judah from among them. [bbe] This is what the Lord has said against all my evil neighbours, who put their hands on the heritage which I gave my people Israel: See, I will have them uprooted from their land, uprooting the people of Judah from among them. 12:15 [hgb] 我 拔 出 他 们 以 后 ， 我 必 转 过 来 怜 悯 他 们 ， 把 他 们 再 带 回 来 ， 各 归 本 业 ， 各 归 故 土 。 [kjv] And it shall come to pass, after that I have plucked them out I will return, and have compassion on them, and will bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land. [bbe] And it will come about that, after they have been uprooted, I will again have pity on them; and I will take them back, every man to his heritage and every man to his land. 12:16 [hgb] 他 们 若 殷 勤 学 习 我 百 姓 的 道 ， 指 着 我 的 名 起 誓 ， 说 ， 我 指 着 永 生 的 耶 和 华 起 誓 ， 正 如 他 们 从 前 教 我 百 姓 指 着 巴 力 起 誓 ， 他 们 就 必 建 立 在 我 百 姓 中 间 。 [kjv] And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, The LORD liveth; as they taught my people to swear by Baal; then shall they be built in the midst of my people. [bbe] And it will be that, if they give their minds to learning the ways of my people, using my name in their oaths, By the living Lord; as they have been teaching my people to take oaths by the Baal; then their place will be made certain among my people. 12:17 [hgb] 他 们 若 是 不 听 ， 我 必 拔 出 那 国 ， 拔 出 而 且 毁 灭 。 这 是 耶 和 华 说 的 。 [kjv] But if they will not obey, I will utterly pluck up and destroy that nation, saith the LORD. [bbe] But if they will not give ear, then I will have that nation uprooted, and given to destruction, says the Lord.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/128/1923.html","bookId":158,"book":{"id":158,"title":"耶利米书 Jeremiah","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 便 雅 悯 地 亚 拿 突 城 的 祭 司 中 ， 希 勒 家 的 儿 子 耶 利 米 的 话 记 在 下 面 。 [kjv] The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/128","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:20 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
