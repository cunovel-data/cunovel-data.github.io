that they may return every man from his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin. \n [bbe] It may be that the people of Judah, hearing of all the evil which it is my purpose to do to them, will be turned, every man from his evil ways; so that they may have my forgiveness for their evil-doing and their sin. \n 36:4 [hgb] 所 以 ， 耶 利 米 召 了 尼 利 亚 的 儿 子 巴 录 来 。 巴 录 就 从 耶 利 米 口 中 ， 将 耶 和 华 对 耶 利 米 所 说 的 一 切 话 写 在 书 卷 上 。 \n [kjv] Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah: and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the LORD, which he had spoken unto him, upon a roll of a book. \n [bbe] Then Jeremiah sent for Baruch, the son of Neriah; and Baruch took down from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the Lord which he had said to him, writing them in a book. \n 36:5 [hgb] 耶 利 米 吩 咐 巴 录 说 ， 我 被 拘 管 ， 不 能 进 耶 和 华 的 殿 。 \n [kjv] And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up; I cannot go into the house of the LORD: \n [bbe] And Jeremiah gave orders to Baruch, saying, I am shut up, and am not able to go into the house of the Lord: \n 36:6 [hgb] 所 以 你 要 去 趁 禁 食 的 日 子 ， 在 耶 和 华 殿 中 将 耶 和 华 的 话 ， 就 是 你 从 我 口 中 所 写 在 书 卷 上 的 话 ， 念 给 百 姓 和 一 切 从 犹 大 城 邑 出 来 的 人 听 。 \n [kjv] Therefore go thou, and read in the roll, which thou hast written from my mouth, the words of the LORD in the ears of the people in the LORD\u0027s house upon the fasting day: and also thou shalt read them in the ears of all Judah that come out of their cities. \n [bbe] So you are to go, reading there from the book, which you have taken down from my mouth, the words of the Lord, in the hearing of the people in the Lord\u0027s house, on a day when they go without food, and in the hearing of all the men of Judah who have come out from their towns. \n 36:7 [hgb] 或 者 他 们 在 耶 和 华 面 前 恳 求 各 人 回 头 ， 离 开 恶 道 ， 因 为 耶 和 华 向 这 百 姓 所 说 要 发 的 怒 气 和 忿 怒 是 大 的 。 \n [kjv] It may be they will present their supplication before the LORD, and will return every one from his evil way: for great is the anger and the fury that the LORD hath pronounced against this people. \n [bbe] It may be that their prayer for grace will go up to the Lord, and that every man will be turned from his evil ways: for great is the wrath and the passion made clear by the Lord against this people. \n 36:8 [hgb] 尼 利 亚 的 儿 子 巴 录 就 照 先 知 耶 利 米 一 切 所 吩 咐 的 去 行 ， 在 耶 和 华 的 殿 中 从 书 上 念 耶 和 华 的 话 。 \n [kjv] And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book the words of the LORD in the LORD\u0027s house. \n [bbe] And Baruch, the son of Neriah, did as Jeremiah the prophet gave him orders to do, reading from the book the words of the Lord in the Lord\u0027s house. \n 36:9 [hgb] 犹 大 王 约 西 亚 的 儿 子 约 雅 敬 第 五 年 九 月 ， 耶 路 撒 冷 的 众 民 和 那 从 犹 大 城 邑 来 到 耶 路 撒 冷 的 众 民 ， 在 耶 和 华 面 前 宣 告 禁 食 的 日 子 ， \n [kjv] And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, in the ninth month, that they proclaimed a fast before the LORD to all the people in Jerusalem, and to all the people that came from the cities of Judah unto Jerusalem. \n [bbe] Now it came about in the fifth year of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month, that it was given out publicly that all the people in Jerusalem, and all the people who came from the towns of Judah to Jerusalem, were to keep from food before the Lord. \n 36:10 [hgb] 巴 录 就 在 耶 和 华 殿 的 上 院 ， 耶 和 华 殿 的 新 门 口 ， 沙 番 的 儿 子 文 士 基 玛 利 雅 的 屋 内 ， 念 书 上 耶 利 米 的 话 给 众 民 听 。 \n [kjv] Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the higher court, at the entry of the new gate of the LORD\u0027s house, in the ears of all the people. \n [bbe] Then Baruch gave a public reading of the words of Jeremiah from the book, in the house of the Lord, in the room of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the higher square, as one goes in by the new doorway of the Lord\u0027s house, in the hearing of all the people. \n 36:11 [hgb] 沙 番 的 孙 子 ， 基 玛 利 雅 的 儿 子 米 该 亚 听 见 书 上 耶 和 华 的 一 切 话 ， \n [kjv] When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all the words of the LORD, \n [bbe] And Micaiah, the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, after hearing all the words of the Lord from the book, \n 36:12 [hgb] 他 就 下 到 王 宫 ， 进 入 文 士 的 屋 子 。 众 首 领 ， 就 是 文 士 以 利 沙 玛 ， 示 玛 雅 的 儿 子 第 莱 雅 ， 亚 革 波 的 儿 子 以 利 拿 单 ， 沙 番 的 儿 子 基 玛 利 雅 ， 哈 拿 尼 雅 的 儿 子 西 底 家 ， 和 其 余 的 首 领 都 坐 在 那 里 。 \n [kjv] Then he went down into the king\u0027s house, into the scribe\u0027s chamber: and, lo, all the princes sat there, even Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes. \n [bbe] Went down to the king\u0027s house, to the scribe\u0027s room: and all the rulers were seated there, Elishama the scribe and Delaiah, the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan, the son of Achbor, and Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah, the son of Hananiah, and all the rulers. \n 36:13 [hgb] 于 是 米 该 亚 对 他 们 述 说 他 所 听 见 的 一 切 话 ， 就 是 巴 录 向 百 姓 念 那 书 的 时 候 所 听 见 的 。 \n [kjv] Then Michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people. \n [bbe] Then Micaiah gave them an account of all the words which had come to his ears when Baruch was reading the book to the people. \n 36:14 [hgb] 众 首 领 就 打 发 古 示 的 曾 孙 ， 示 利 米 雅 的 孙 子 ， 尼 探 雅 的 儿 子 犹 底 到 巴 录 那 里 ， 对 他 说 ， 你 将 所 念 给 百 姓 听 的 书 卷 拿 在 手 中 到 我 们 这 里 来 。 尼 利 亚 的 儿 子 巴 录 就 手 拿 书 卷 来 到 他 们 那 里 。 \n [kjv] Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, unto Baruch, saying, Take in thine hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people, and come. So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand, and came unto them. \n [bbe] So all the rulers sent Jehudi, the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to Baruch, saying, Take in your hand the book from which you have been reading to the people and come. So Baruch, the son of Neriah, took the book in his hand and came down to them. \n 36:15 [hgb] 他 们 对 他 说 ， 请 你 坐 下 ， 念 给 我 们 听 。 巴 录 就 念 给 他 们 听 。 \n [kjv] And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read it in their ears. \n [bbe] Then they said to him, Be seated now, and give us a reading from it. So Baruch did so, reading it to them. \n 36:16 [hgb] 他 们 听 见 这 一 切 话 就 害 怕 ， 面 面 相 观 ， 对 巴 录 说 ， 我 们 必 须 将 这 一 切 话 告 诉 王 。 \n [kjv] Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they were afraid both one and other, and said unto Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words. \n [bbe] Now it came about that, after hearing all the words, they said to one another in fear, We will certainly give the king an account of all these words. \n 36:17 [hgb] 他 们 问 巴 录 说 ， 请 你 告 诉 我 们 ， 你 怎 样 从 他 口 中 写 这 一 切 话 呢 ？ \n [kjv] And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou write all these words at his mouth? \n [bbe] And questioning Baruch, they said, Say now, how did you put all these words down in writing from his mouth? \n 36:18 [hgb] 巴 录 回 答 说 ， 他 用 口 向 我 说 这 一 切 话 ， 我 就 用 笔 墨 写 在 书 上 。 \n [kjv] Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book. \n [bbe] Then Baruch, answering, said, He said all these things to me by word of mouth, and I put them down with ink in the book. \n 36:19 [hgb] 众 首 领 对 巴 录 说 ， 你 和 耶 利 米 要 去 藏 起 来 ， 不 可 叫 人 知 道 你 们 在 哪 里 。 \n [kjv] Then said the princes unto Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and Jeremiah; and let no man know where ye be. \n [bbe] Then the rulers said to Baruch, Go and put yourself in a safe place, you and Jeremiah, and let no man have knowledge of where you are. \n 36:20 [hgb] 众 首 领 进 院 见 王 ， 却 先 把 书 卷 存 在 文 士 以 利 沙 玛 的 屋 内 ， 以 后 将 这 一 切 话 说 给 王 听 。 \n [kjv] And they went in to the king into the court, but they laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and told all the words in the ears of the king. \n [bbe] Then they went into the open square to the king; but the book they put away in the room of Elishama the scribe; and they gave the king an account of all the words. \n 36:21 [hgb] 王 就 打 发 犹 底 去 拿 这 书 卷 来 ， 他 便 从 文 士 以 利 沙 玛 的 屋 内 取 来 ， 念 给 王 和 王 左 右 侍 立 的 众 首 领 听 。 \n [kjv] So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll: and he took it out of Elishama the scribe\u0027s chamber. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the king. \n [bbe] So the king sent Jehudi to get the book, and he took it from the room of Elishama the scribe. And Jehudi gave a reading of it in the hearing of the king and all the rulers who were by the king\u0027s side. \n 36:22 [hgb] 那 时 正 是 九 月 ， 王 坐 在 过 冬 的 房 屋 里 ， 王 的 前 面 火 盆 中 有 烧 着 的 火 。 \n [kjv] Now the king sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month: and there was a fire on the hearth burning before him. \n [bbe] Now the king was seated in the winter house, and a fire was burning in the fireplace in front of him. \n 36:23 [hgb] 犹 底 念 了 三 四 篇 （ 或 作 行 ） ， 王 就 用 文 士 的 刀 将 书 卷 割 破 ， 扔 在 火 盆 中 ， 直 到 全 卷 在 火 中 烧 尽 了 。 \n [kjv] And it came to pass, that when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, he cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was on the hearth, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was on the hearth. \n [bbe] And it came about that whenever Jehudi, in his reading, had got through three or four divisions, the king, cutting them with his penknife, put them into the fire, till all the book was burned up in the fire which was burning in the fireplace. \n 36:24 [hgb] 王 和 听 见 这 一 切 话 的 臣 仆 都 不 惧 怕 ， 也 不 撕 裂 衣 服 。 \n [kjv] Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither the king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words. \n [bbe] But they had no fear and gave no signs of grief, not the king or any of his servants, after hearing all these words. \n 36:25 [hgb] 以 利 拿 单 和 第 莱 雅 ， 并 基 玛 利 雅 恳 求 王 不 要 烧 这 书 卷 ， 他 却 不 听 。 \n [kjv] Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll: but he would not hear them. \n [bbe] And Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made a strong request to the king not to let the book be burned, but he would not give ear to them. \n 36:26 [hgb] 王 就 吩 咐 哈 米 勒 的 儿 子 （ 或 作 王 的 儿 子 ） 耶 拉 篾 和 亚 斯 列 的 儿 子 西 莱 雅 ， 并 亚 伯 叠 的 儿 子 示 利 米 雅 ， 去 捉 拿 文 士 巴 录 和 先 知 耶 利 米 。 耶 和 华 却 将 他 们 隐 藏 。 \n [kjv] But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet: but the LORD hid them. \n [bbe] And the king gave orders to Jerahmeel, the king\u0027s son, and Seraiah, the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah, the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet: but the Lord kept them safe. \n 36:27 [hgb] 王 烧 了 书 卷 。 其 上 有 巴 录 从 耶 利 米 口 中 所 写 的 话 。 以 后 耶 和 华 的 话 临 到 耶 利 米 说 ， \n [kjv] Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, after that the king had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying, \n [bbe] Then after the book, in which Baruch had put down the words of Jeremiah, had been burned by the king, the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying, \n 36:28 [hgb] 你 再 取 一 卷 ， 将 犹 大 王 约 雅 敬 所 烧 第 一 卷 上 的 一 切 话 写 在 其 上 。 \n [kjv] Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burned. \n [bbe] Take another book and put down in it all the words which were in the first book, which Jehoiakim, king of Judah, put into the fire. \n 36:29 [hgb] 论 到 犹 大 王 约 雅 敬 你 要 说 ， 耶 和 华 如 此 说 ， 你 烧 了 书 卷 ， 说 ， 你 为 什 么 在 其 上 写 着 ， 说 巴 比 伦 王 必 要 来 毁 灭 这 地 ， 使 这 地 上 绝 了 人 民 牲 畜 呢 ？ \n [kjv] And thou shalt say to Jehoiakim king of Judah, Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast burned this roll, saying, Why hast thou written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast? \n [bbe] And about Jehoiakim, king of Judah, you are to say, This is what the Lord has said: You have put this book into the fire, saying, Why have you put in it that the king of Babylon will certainly come, causing the destruction of this land and putting an end to every man and beast in it? \n 36:30 [hgb] 所 以 耶 和 华 论 到 犹 大 王 约 雅 敬 说 ， 他 后 裔 中 必 没 有 人 坐 在 大 卫 的 宝 座 上 。 他 的 尸 首 必 被 抛 弃 ， 白 日 受 炎 热 ， 黑 夜 受 寒 霜 。 \n [kjv] Therefore thus saith the LORD of Jehoiakim king of Judah; He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David: and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost. \n [bbe] For this reason the Lord has said of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, He will have no son to take his place on the seat of David: his dead body will be put out to undergo the heat of the day and the cold of the night. \n 36:31 [hgb] 我 必 因 他 和 他 后 裔 ， 并 他 臣 仆 的 罪 孽 刑 罚 他 们 。 我 要 使 我 所 说 的 一 切 灾 祸 临 到 他 们 和 耶 路 撒 冷 的 居 民 ， 并 犹 大 人 。 只 是 他 们 不 听 。 \n [kjv] And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them; but they hearkened not. \n [bbe] And I will send punishment on him and on his seed and on his servants for their evil-doing; I will send on them and on the people of Jerusalem and the men of Judah, all the evil which I said against them, but they did not give ear. \n 36:32 [hgb] 于 是 ， 耶 利 米 又 取 一 书 卷 交 给 尼 利 亚 的 儿 子 文 士 巴 录 ， 他 就 从 耶 利 米 的 口 中 写 了 犹 大 王 约 雅 敬 所 烧 前 卷 上 的 一 切 话 ， 另 外 又 添 了 许 多 相 彷 的 话 。 \n [kjv] Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire: and there were added besides unto them many like words. \n [bbe] Then Jeremiah took another book, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who put down in it, from the mouth of Jeremiah, all the words of the book which had been burned in the fire by Jehoiakim, king of Judah: and in addition a number of other words of the same sort. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/128/1947.html","bookId":158,"book":{"id":158,"title":"耶利米书 Jeremiah","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 便 雅 悯 地 亚 拿 突 城 的 祭 司 中 ， 希 勒 家 的 儿 子 耶 利 米 的 话 记 在 下 面 。 [kjv] The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/128","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:20 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
