Behold, as the clay is in the potter\u0027s hand, so are ye in mine hand, O house of Israel. \n [bbe] O Israel, am I not able to do with you as this potter does? says the Lord. See, like earth in the potter\u0027s hand are you in my hands, O Israel. \n 18:7 [hgb] 我 何 时 论 到 一 邦 或 一 国 说 ， 要 拔 出 ， 拆 毁 ， 毁 坏 。 \n [kjv] At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy it; \n [bbe] Whenever I say anything about uprooting a nation or a kingdom, and smashing it and sending destruction on it; \n 18:8 [hgb] 我 所 说 的 那 一 邦 ， 若 是 转 意 离 开 他 们 的 恶 ， 我 就 必 后 悔 ， 不 将 我 想 要 施 行 的 灾 祸 降 与 他 们 。 \n [kjv] If that nation, against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them. \n [bbe] If, in that very minute, that nation of which I was talking is turned away from its evil, my purpose of doing evil to them will be changed. \n 18:9 [hgb] 我 何 时 论 到 一 邦 或 一 国 说 ， 要 建 立 ， 栽 植 。 \n [kjv] And at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it; \n [bbe] And whenever I say anything about building up a nation or a kingdom, and planting it; \n 18:10 [hgb] 他 们 若 行 我 眼 中 看 为 恶 的 事 ， 不 听 从 我 的 话 ， 我 就 必 后 悔 ， 不 将 我 所 说 的 福 气 赐 给 他 们 。 \n [kjv] If it do evil in my sight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good, wherewith I said I would benefit them. \n [bbe] If, in that very minute, it does evil in my eyes, going against my orders, then my good purpose, which I said I would do for them, will be changed. \n 18:11 [hgb] 现 在 你 要 对 犹 大 人 和 耶 路 撒 冷 的 居 民 说 ， 耶 和 华 如 此 说 ， 我 造 出 灾 祸 攻 击 你 们 ， 定 意 刑 罚 你 们 。 你 们 各 人 当 回 头 离 开 所 行 的 恶 道 ， 改 正 你 们 的 行 动 作 为 。 \n [kjv] Now therefore go to, speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I frame evil against you, and devise a device against you: return ye now every one from his evil way, and make your ways and your doings good. \n [bbe] Now, then, say to the men of Judah and to the people of Jerusalem, This is what the Lord has said: See, I am forming an evil thing against you, and designing a design against you: let every man come back now from his evil way, and let your ways and your doings be changed for the better. \n 18:12 [hgb] 他 们 却 说 ， 这 是 枉 然 。 我 们 要 照 自 己 的 计 谋 去 行 。 各 人 随 自 己 顽 梗 的 恶 心 作 事 。 \n [kjv] And they said, There is no hope: but we will walk after our own devices, and we will every one do the imagination of his evil heart. \n [bbe] But they will say, There is no hope: we will go on in our designs, and every one of us will do what he is moved by the pride of his evil heart to do. \n 18:13 [hgb] 所 以 ， 耶 和 华 如 此 说 ， 你 们 且 往 各 国 访 问 ， 有 谁 听 见 这 样 的 事 。 以 色 列 民 （ 原 文 作 处 女 ） 行 了 一 件 极 可 憎 恶 的 事 。 \n [kjv] Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ask ye now among the heathen, who hath heard such things: the virgin of Israel hath done a very horrible thing. \n [bbe] So this is what the Lord has said: Make search among the nations and see who has had word of such things; the virgin of Israel has done a very shocking thing. \n 18:14 [hgb] 利 巴 嫩 的 雪 从 田 野 的 磐 石 上 岂 能 断 绝 呢 ？ 从 远 处 流 下 的 凉 水 岂 能 干 涸 呢 ？ \n [kjv] Will a man leave the snow of Lebanon which cometh from the rock of the field? or shall the cold flowing waters that come from another place be forsaken? \n [bbe] Will the white snow go away from the top of Sirion? will the cold waters flowing from the mountains become dry? \n 18:15 [hgb] 我 的 百 姓 竟 忘 记 我 ， 向 假 神 烧 香 ， 使 他 们 在 所 行 的 路 上 ， 在 古 道 上 绊 跌 ， 使 他 们 行 没 有 修 筑 的 斜 路 ， \n [kjv] Because my people hath forgotten me, they have burned incense to vanity, and they have caused them to stumble in their ways from the ancient paths, to walk in paths, in a way not cast up; \n [bbe] For my people have put me out of their memory, burning perfumes to that which is nothing; and because of this, I will put a cause of falling in their ways, even in the old roads, and will make them go on side-roads, in a way not lifted up; \n 18:16 [hgb] 以 致 他 们 的 地 令 人 惊 骇 ， 常 常 嗤 笑 。 凡 经 过 这 地 的 必 惊 骇 摇 头 。 \n [kjv] To make their land desolate, and a perpetual hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished, and wag his head. \n [bbe] Making their land a thing of wonder, causing sounds of surprise for ever; everyone who goes by will be overcome with wonder, shaking his head. \n 18:17 [hgb] 我 必 在 仇 敌 面 前 分 散 他 们 ， 好 像 用 东 风 吹 散 一 样 。 遭 难 的 日 子 ， 我 必 以 背 向 他 们 ， 不 以 面 向 他 们 。 \n [kjv] I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I will shew them the back, and not the face, in the day of their calamity. \n [bbe] I will send them in flight, as from an east wind, before the attacker; I will let them see my back and not my face on the day of their downfall. \n 18:18 [hgb] 他 们 就 说 ， 来 吧 。 我 们 可 以 设 计 谋 害 耶 利 米 。 因 为 我 们 有 祭 司 讲 律 法 ， 智 慧 人 设 谋 略 ， 先 知 说 预 言 ， 都 不 能 断 绝 。 来 吧 。 我 们 可 以 用 舌 头 击 打 他 ， 不 要 理 会 他 的 一 切 话 。 \n [kjv] Then said they, Come, and let us devise devices against Jeremiah; for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, and let us smite him with the tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his words. \n [bbe] Then they said, Come, let us make a design against Jeremiah; for teaching will never be cut off from the priest, or wisdom from the wise, or the word from the prophet. Come, let us make use of his words for an attack on him, and let us give attention with care to what he says. \n 18:19 [hgb] 耶 和 华 阿 ， 求 你 理 会 我 ， 且 听 那 些 与 我 争 竞 之 人 的 话 。 \n [kjv] Give heed to me, O LORD, and hearken to the voice of them that contend with me. \n [bbe] Give thought to me, O Lord, and give ear to the voice of those who put forward a cause against me. \n 18:20 [hgb] 岂 可 以 恶 报 善 呢 ？ 他 们 竟 挖 坑 要 害 我 的 性 命 。 求 你 记 念 我 怎 样 站 在 你 面 前 为 他 们 代 求 ， 要 使 你 的 忿 怒 向 他 们 转 消 。 \n [kjv] Shall evil be recompensed for good? for they have digged a pit for my soul. Remember that I stood before thee to speak good for them, and to turn away thy wrath from them. \n [bbe] Is evil to be the reward of good? for they have made a deep hole for my soul. Keep in mind how I took my place before you, to say a good word for them so that your wrath might be turned away from them. \n 18:21 [hgb] 故 此 ， 愿 你 将 他 们 的 儿 女 交 与 饥 荒 和 刀 剑 。 愿 他 们 的 妻 无 子 ， 且 作 寡 妇 。 又 愿 他 们 的 男 人 被 死 亡 所 灭 ， 他 们 的 少 年 人 在 阵 上 被 刀 击 杀 。 \n [kjv] Therefore deliver up their children to the famine, and pour out their blood by the force of the sword; and let their wives be bereaved of their children, and be widows; and let their men be put to death; let their young men be slain by the sword in battle. \n [bbe] For this cause, let their children be without food, and give them over to the power of the sword; and let their wives be without children and become widows; let their men be overtaken by death, and their young men be put to the sword in the fight. \n 18:22 [hgb] 你 使 敌 军 忽 然 临 到 他 们 的 时 候 ， 愿 人 听 见 哀 声 从 他 们 的 屋 内 发 出 。 因 他 们 挖 坑 要 捉 拿 我 ， 暗 设 网 罗 要 绊 我 的 脚 。 \n [kjv] Let a cry be heard from their houses, when thou shalt bring a troop suddenly upon them: for they have digged a pit to take me, and hid snares for my feet. \n [bbe] Let a cry for help go up from their houses, when you send an armed band on them suddenly: for they have made a hole in which to take me, and have put nets for my feet secretly. \n 18:23 [hgb] 耶 和 华 阿 ， 他 们 要 杀 我 的 那 一 切 计 谋 ， 你 都 知 道 。 不 要 赦 免 他 们 的 罪 孽 ， 也 不 要 从 你 面 前 涂 抹 他 们 的 罪 恶 ， 要 叫 他 们 在 你 面 前 跌 倒 。 愿 你 发 怒 的 时 候 罚 办 他 们 。 \n [kjv] Yet, LORD, thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay me: forgive not their iniquity, neither blot out their sin from thy sight, but let them be overthrown before thee; deal thus with them in the time of thine anger. \n [bbe] But you, Lord, have knowledge of all the designs which they have made against my life; let not their evil-doing be covered or their sin be washed away from before your eyes: but let it be a cause of falling before you: so do to them in the time of your wrath. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/128/1929.html","bookId":158,"book":{"id":158,"title":"耶利米书 Jeremiah","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 便 雅 悯 地 亚 拿 突 城 的 祭 司 中 ， 希 勒 家 的 儿 子 耶 利 米 的 话 记 在 下 面 。 [kjv] The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/128","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:20 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
