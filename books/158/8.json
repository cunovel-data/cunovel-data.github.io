Lo, certainly in vain made he it; the pen of the scribes is in vain. \n [bbe] How is it that you say, We are wise and the law of the Lord is with us? But see, the false pen of the scribes has made it false. \n 8:9 [hgb] 智 慧 人 惭 愧 ， 惊 惶 ， 被 擒 拿 。 他 们 弃 掉 耶 和 华 的 话 ， 心 里 还 有 什 么 智 慧 呢 ？ \n [kjv] The wise men are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken: lo, they have rejected the word of the LORD; and what wisdom is in them? \n [bbe] The wise men are shamed, they are overcome with fear and taken: see, they have given up the word of the Lord; and what use is their wisdom to them? \n 8:10 [hgb] 所 以 我 必 将 他 们 的 妻 子 给 别 人 ， 将 他 们 的 田 地 给 别 人 为 业 。 因 为 他 们 从 最 小 的 到 至 大 的 都 一 味 地 贪 婪 ， 从 先 知 到 祭 司 都 行 事 虚 谎 。 \n [kjv] Therefore will I give their wives unto others, and their fields to them that shall inherit them: for every one from the least even unto the greatest is given to covetousness, from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely. \n [bbe] So I will give their wives to others, and their fields to those who will take them for themselves: for everyone, from the least to the greatest, is given up to getting money; from the priest even to the prophet, everyone is false. \n 8:11 [hgb] 他 们 轻 轻 忽 忽 地 医 治 我 百 姓 的 损 伤 ， 说 ， 平 安 了 。 平 安 了 。 其 实 没 有 平 安 。 \n [kjv] For they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace. \n [bbe] And they have made little of the wounds of the daughter of Zion, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace. \n 8:12 [hgb] 他 们 行 可 憎 的 事 知 道 惭 愧 吗 ？ 不 然 ， 他 们 毫 不 惭 愧 ， 也 不 知 羞 耻 。 因 此 他 们 必 在 仆 倒 的 人 中 仆 倒 。 我 向 他 们 讨 罪 的 时 候 ， 他 们 必 致 跌 倒 。 这 是 耶 和 华 说 的 。 \n [kjv] Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore shall they fall among them that fall: in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down, saith the LORD. \n [bbe] Let them be put to shame because they have done disgusting things. They had no shame, they were not able to become red with shame: so they will come down with those who are falling: in the time of their punishment they will be made low, says the Lord. \n 8:13 [hgb] 耶 和 华 说 ， 我 必 使 他 们 全 然 灭 绝 。 葡 萄 树 上 必 没 有 葡 萄 ， 无 花 果 树 上 必 没 有 果 子 ， 叶 子 也 必 枯 干 。 我 所 赐 给 他 们 的 ， 必 离 开 他 们 过 去 。 \n [kjv] I will surely consume them, saith the LORD: there shall be no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree, and the leaf shall fade; and the things that I have given them shall pass away from them. \n [bbe] I will put an end to them completely, says the Lord: there are no grapes on the vine and no figs on the fig-tree, and the leaf is dry. \n 8:14 [hgb] 我 们 为 何 静 坐 不 动 呢 ？ 我 们 当 聚 集 ， 进 入 坚 固 城 ， 在 那 里 静 默 不 言 。 因 为 耶 和 华 我 们 的 神 使 我 们 静 默 不 言 ， 又 将 苦 胆 水 给 我 们 喝 ， 都 因 我 们 得 罪 了 耶 和 华 。 \n [kjv] Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the defenced cities, and let us be silent there: for the LORD our God hath put us to silence, and given us water of gall to drink, because we have sinned against the LORD. \n [bbe] Why are we seated doing nothing? come together, and let us go to the walled towns, and let destruction overtake us there, for the Lord our God has sent destruction on us, and given us bitter water for our drink, because we have done evil against the Lord. \n 8:15 [hgb] 我 们 指 望 平 安 ， 却 得 不 着 好 处 。 指 望 痊 愈 的 时 候 ， 不 料 ， 受 了 惊 惶 。 \n [kjv] We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of health, and behold trouble! \n [bbe] We were looking for peace, but no good came; and for a time of well-being, but there is only a great fear. \n 8:16 [hgb] 听 见 从 但 那 里 敌 人 的 马 喷 鼻 气 ， 他 的 壮 马 发 嘶 声 ， 全 地 就 都 震 动 。 因 为 他 们 来 吞 灭 这 地 和 其 上 所 有 的 ， 吞 灭 这 城 与 其 中 的 居 民 。 \n [kjv] The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan: the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones; for they are come, and have devoured the land, and all that is in it; the city, and those that dwell therein. \n [bbe] The loud breathing of the horses comes to our ears from Dan: at the sound of the outcry of his war-horses, all the land is shaking with fear; for they have come, and have made a meal of the land and everything in it; the town and the people living in it. \n 8:17 [hgb] 看 哪 ， 我 必 使 毒 蛇 到 你 们 中 间 ， 是 不 服 法 术 的 ， 必 咬 你 们 。 这 是 耶 和 华 说 的 。 \n [kjv] For, behold, I will send serpents, cockatrices, among you, which will not be charmed, and they shall bite you, saith the LORD. \n [bbe] See, I will send snakes and poison-snakes among you, against which the wonder-worker has no power; and they will give you wounds which may not be made well, says the Lord. \n 8:18 [hgb] 我 有 忧 愁 ， 愿 能 自 慰 。 我 心 在 我 里 面 发 昏 。 \n [kjv] When I would comfort myself against sorrow, my heart is faint in me. \n [bbe] Sorrow has come on me! my heart in me is feeble. \n 8:19 [hgb] 听 阿 ， 是 我 百 姓 的 哀 声 从 极 远 之 地 而 来 ， 说 ， 耶 和 华 不 在 锡 安 吗 ？ 锡 安 的 王 不 在 其 中 吗 ？ 耶 和 华 说 ， 他 们 为 什 么 以 雕 刻 的 偶 像 和 外 邦 虚 无 的 神 惹 我 发 怒 呢 ？ \n [kjv] Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people because of them that dwell in a far country: Is not the LORD in Zion? is not her king in her? Why have they provoked me to anger with their graven images, and with strange vanities? \n [bbe] The voice of the cry of the daughter of my people comes from a far land: Is the Lord not in Zion? is not her King in her? Why have they made me angry with their images and their strange gods which are no gods? \n 8:20 [hgb] 麦 秋 已 过 ， 夏 令 已 完 ， 我 们 还 未 得 救 。 \n [kjv] The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved. \n [bbe] The grain-cutting is past, the summer is ended, and no salvation has come to us. \n 8:21 [hgb] 先 知 说 ， 因 我 百 姓 的 损 伤 ， 我 也 受 了 损 伤 。 我 哀 痛 ， 惊 惶 将 我 抓 住 。 \n [kjv] For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt; I am black; astonishment hath taken hold on me. \n [bbe] For the destruction of the daughter of my people I am broken: I am dressed in the clothing of grief; fear has taken me in its grip. \n 8:22 [hgb] 在 基 列 岂 没 有 乳 香 呢 ？ 在 那 里 岂 没 有 医 生 呢 ？ 我 百 姓 为 何 不 得 痊 愈 呢 ？ \n [kjv] Is there no balm in Gilead; is there no physician there? why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered? \n [bbe] Is there no life-giving oil in Gilead? is there no expert in medical arts? why then have my people not been made well? \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/128/1919.html","bookId":158,"book":{"id":158,"title":"耶利米书 Jeremiah","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 便 雅 悯 地 亚 拿 突 城 的 祭 司 中 ， 希 勒 家 的 儿 子 耶 利 米 的 话 记 在 下 面 。 [kjv] The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/128","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:20 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
