{"id":4549,"no":48,"title":"Chapter 48","content":"48:1 [hgb] 论 摩 押 。 万 军 之 耶 和 华 以 色 列 的 神 如 此 说 ， 尼 波 有 祸 了 。 因 变 为 荒 场 。 基 列 亭 蒙 羞 被 攻 取 。 米 斯 迦 蒙 羞 被 毁 坏 。 [kjv] Against Moab thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Woe unto Nebo! for it is spoiled: Kiriathaim is confounded and taken: Misgab is confounded and dismayed. [bbe] Of Moab. The Lord of armies, the God of Israel, has said: Sorrow on Nebo, for it has been made waste; Kiriathaim has been put to shame and is taken: the strong place is put to shame and broken down. 48:2 [hgb] 摩 押 不 再 被 称 赞 。 有 人 在 希 实 本 设 计 谋 害 她 ， 说 ， 来 吧 。 我 们 将 她 剪 除 ， 不 再 成 国 。 玛 得 缅 哪 ， 你 也 必 默 默 无 声 。 刀 剑 必 追 赶 你 。 [kjv] There shall be no more praise of Moab: in Heshbon they have devised evil against it; come, and let us cut it off from being a nation. Also thou shalt be cut down, O Madmen; the sword shall pursue thee. [bbe] The praise of Moab has come to an end; as for Heshbon, evil has been designed against her; come, let us put an end to her as a nation. But your mouth will be shut, O Madmen; the sword will go after you. 48:3 [hgb] 从 何 罗 念 有 喊 荒 凉 大 毁 灭 的 哀 声 ， [kjv] A voice of crying shall be from Horonaim, spoiling and great destruction. [bbe] There is the sound of crying from Horonaim, wasting and great destruction; 48:4 [hgb] 摩 押 毁 灭 了 。 她 的 孩 童 （ 或 作 家 僮 ） 发 哀 声 ， 使 人 听 见 。 [kjv] Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard. [bbe] Moab is broken; her cry has gone out to Zoar. 48:5 [hgb] 人 上 鲁 希 坡 随 走 随 哭 ， 因 为 在 何 罗 念 的 下 坡 听 见 毁 灭 的 哀 声 。 [kjv] For in the going up of Luhith continual weeping shall go up; for in the going down of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction. [bbe] For by the slope of Luhith they will go up, weeping all the way; for on the way down to Horonaim the cry of destruction has come to their ears. 48:6 [hgb] 你 们 要 奔 逃 ， 自 救 性 命 ， 独 自 居 住 ， 好 像 旷 野 的 杜 松 。 [kjv] Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the wilderness. [bbe] Go in flight, get away with your lives, and let your faces be turned to Aroer in the Arabah. 48:7 [hgb] 你 因 倚 靠 自 己 所 作 的 和 自 己 的 财 宝 必 被 攻 取 。 基 抹 和 属 他 的 祭 司 ， 首 领 也 要 一 同 被 掳 去 。 [kjv] For because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures, thou shalt also be taken: and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity with his priests and his princes together. [bbe] For because you have put your faith in your strong places, you, even you, will be taken: and Chemosh will go out as a prisoner, his priests and his rulers together. 48:8 [hgb] 行 毁 灭 的 必 来 到 各 城 ， 并 无 一 城 得 免 。 山 谷 必 至 败 落 ， 平 原 必 被 毁 坏 。 正 如 耶 和 华 所 说 的 。 [kjv] And the spoiler shall come upon every city, and no city shall escape: the valley also shall perish, and the plain shall be destroyed, as the LORD hath spoken. [bbe] And the attacker will come against every town, not one will be safe; and the valley will be made waste, and destruction will come to the lowland, as the Lord has said. 48:9 [hgb] 要 将 翅 膀 给 摩 押 ， 使 她 可 以 飞 去 。 她 的 城 邑 必 至 荒 凉 ， 无 人 居 住 。 [kjv] Give wings unto Moab, that it may flee and get away: for the cities thereof shall be desolate, without any to dwell therein. [bbe] Put up a pillar for Moab, for she will come to a complete end: and her towns will become a waste, without anyone living in them. 48:10 [hgb] 懒 惰 为 耶 和 华 行 事 的 ， 必 受 咒 诅 。 禁 止 刀 剑 不 经 血 的 ， 必 受 咒 诅 。 [kjv] Cursed be he that doeth the work of the LORD deceitfully, and cursed be he that keepeth back his sword from blood. [bbe] Let him be cursed who does the Lord\u0027s work half-heartedly; let him be cursed who keeps back his sword from blood. 48:11 [hgb] 摩 押 自 幼 年 以 来 常 享 安 逸 ， 如 酒 在 渣 滓 上 澄 清 ， 没 有 从 这 器 皿 倒 在 那 器 皿 里 ， 也 未 曾 被 掳 去 。 因 此 ， 它 的 原 味 尚 存 ， 香 气 未 变 。 [kjv] Moab hath been at ease from his youth, and he hath settled on his lees, and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither hath he gone into captivity: therefore his taste remained in him, and his scent is not changed. [bbe] From his earliest days, Moab has been living in comfort; like wine long stored he has not been drained from vessel to vessel, he has never gone away as a prisoner: so his taste is still in him, his smell is unchanged. 48:12 [hgb] 耶 和 华 说 ， 日 子 将 到 ， 我 必 打 发 倒 酒 的 往 她 那 里 去 ， 将 她 倒 出 来 ， 倒 空 她 的 器 皿 ， 打 碎 她 的 坛 子 。 [kjv] Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will send unto him wanderers, that shall cause him to wander, and shall empty his vessels, and break their bottles. [bbe] So truly, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will send to him men who will have him turned over till there is no more wine in his vessels, and his wine-skins will be completely broken. 48:13 [hgb] 摩 押 必 因 基 抹 羞 愧 ， 像 以 色 列 家 从 前 倚 靠 伯 特 利 的 神 羞 愧 一 样 。 [kjv] And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel their confidence. [bbe] And Moab will be shamed on account of Chemosh, as the children of Israel were shamed on account of Beth-el their hope. 48:14 [hgb] 你 们 怎 么 说 ， 我 们 是 勇 士 ， 是 有 勇 力 打 仗 的 呢 ？ [kjv] How say ye, We are mighty and strong men for the war? [bbe] How say you, We are men of war and strong fighters? 48:15 [hgb] 摩 押 变 为 荒 场 ， 敌 人 上 去 进 了 她 的 城 邑 。 她 所 特 选 的 少 年 人 下 去 遭 了 杀 戮 。 这 是 君 王 名 为 万 军 之 耶 和 华 说 的 。 [kjv] Moab is spoiled, and gone up out of her cities, and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter, saith the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts. [bbe] He who makes Moab waste has gone up against her; and the best of her young men have gone down to their death, says the King, whose name is the Lord of armies. 48:16 [hgb] 摩 押 的 灾 殃 临 近 。 她 的 苦 难 速 速 来 到 。 [kjv] The calamity of Moab is near to come, and his affliction hasteth fast. [bbe] The fate of Moab is near, and trouble is coming on him very quickly. 48:17 [hgb] 凡 在 她 四 围 的 和 认 识 她 名 的 ， 你 们 都 要 为 她 悲 伤 ， 说 ， 那 结 实 的 杖 和 那 美 好 的 棍 ， 何 竟 折 断 了 呢 ？ [kjv] All ye that are about him, bemoan him; and all ye that know his name, say, How is the strong staff broken, and the beautiful rod! [bbe] All you who are round about him, give signs of grief for him, and all you who have knowledge of his name, say, How is the strong rod broken, even the beautiful branch! 48:18 [hgb] 住 在 底 本 的 民 哪 （ 民 原 文 作 女 子 ） ， 要 从 你 荣 耀 的 位 上 下 来 ， 坐 受 干 渴 。 因 毁 灭 摩 押 的 上 来 攻 击 你 ， 毁 坏 了 你 的 保 障 。 [kjv] Thou daughter that dost inhabit Dibon, come down from thy glory, and sit in thirst; for the spoiler of Moab shall come upon thee, and he shall destroy thy strong holds. [bbe] Come down from your glory, O people of Dibon, and take your seat in the place of the waste; for the attacker of Moab has gone up against you, sending destruction on your strong places. 48:19 [hgb] 住 亚 罗 珥 的 阿 ， 要 站 在 道 旁 观 望 ， 问 逃 避 的 男 人 和 逃 脱 的 女 人 说 ， 是 什 么 事 呢 ？ [kjv] O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way, and espy; ask him that fleeth, and her that escapeth, and say, What is done? [bbe] O daughter of Aroer, take your station by the way, on the watch: questioning him who is in flight, and her who has got away safe, say, What has been done? 48:20 [hgb] 摩 押 因 毁 坏 蒙 羞 。 你 们 要 哀 号 呼 喊 ， 要 在 亚 嫩 旁 报 告 说 ， 摩 押 变 为 荒 场 。 [kjv] Moab is confounded; for it is broken down: howl and cry; tell ye it in Arnon, that Moab is spoiled, [bbe] Moab has been put to shame, she is broken: make loud sounds of grief, crying out for help; give the news in Arnon, that Moab has been made waste. 48:21 [hgb] 刑 罚 临 到 平 原 之 地 的 何 伦 ， 雅 杂 ， 米 法 押 ， [kjv] And judgment is come upon the plain country; upon Holon, and upon Jahazah, and upon Mephaath, [bbe] And punishment has come on the lowlands; on Holon and Jahzah, and on Mephaath, 48:22 [hgb] 底 本 ， 尼 波 ， 伯 低 比 拉 太 音 ， [kjv] And upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon Bethdiblathaim, [bbe] And on Dibon, and on Nebo, and on Beth-diblathaim, 48:23 [hgb] 基 列 亭 ， 伯 迦 末 ， 伯 米 恩 ， [kjv] And upon Kiriathaim, and upon Bethgamul, and upon Bethmeon, [bbe] And on Kiriathaim, and on Beth-gamul, and on Beth-meon, 48:24 [hgb] 加 略 ， 波 斯 拉 ， 和 摩 押 地 远 近 所 有 的 城 邑 。 [kjv] And upon Kerioth, and upon Bozrah, and upon all the cities of the land of Moab, far or near. [bbe] And on Kerioth, and on Bozrah, and on all the towns of the land of Moab, far and near. 48:25 [hgb] 摩 押 的 角 砍 断 了 ， 摩 押 的 膀 臂 折 断 了 。 这 是 耶 和 华 说 的 。 [kjv] The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, saith the LORD. [bbe] The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, says the Lord. 48:26 [hgb] 你 们 要 使 摩 押 沉 醉 ， 因 她 向 耶 和 华 夸 大 。 她 要 在 自 己 所 吐 之 中 打 滚 ， 又 要 被 人 嗤 笑 。 [kjv] Make ye him drunken: for he magnified himself against the LORD: Moab also shall wallow in his vomit, and he also shall be in derision. [bbe] Make him full of wine, for his heart has been lifted up against the Lord: and Moab will be rolling in the food he was not able to keep down, and everyone will be making sport of him. 48:27 [hgb] 摩 押 阿 ， 你 不 曾 嗤 笑 以 色 列 吗 ？ 她 岂 是 在 贼 中 查 出 来 的 呢 ？ 你 每 逢 提 到 她 便 摇 头 。 [kjv] For was not Israel a derision unto thee? was he found among thieves? for since thou spakest of him, thou skippedst for joy. [bbe] For did you not make sport of Israel? was he taken among thieves? for whenever you were talking about him, you were shaking your head over him. 48:28 [hgb] 摩 押 的 居 民 哪 ， 要 离 开 城 邑 ， 住 在 山 崖 里 ， 像 鸽 子 在 深 渊 口 上 搭 窝 。 [kjv] O ye that dwell in Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the rock, and be like the dove that maketh her nest in the sides of the hole\u0027s mouth. [bbe] O people of Moab, go away from the towns and take cover in the rock; be like the dove of the Arabah, which makes her living-place in holes. 48:29 [hgb] 我 们 听 说 摩 押 人 骄 傲 ， 是 极 其 骄 傲 。 听 说 他 自 高 自 傲 ， 并 且 狂 妄 ， 居 心 自 大 。 [kjv] We have heard the pride of Moab, (he is exceeding proud) his loftiness, and his arrogancy, and his pride, and the haughtiness of his heart. [bbe] We have had word of the pride of Moab, how great it is; how he is lifted up in pride; and his great opinion of himself, and that his heart is lifted up. 48:30 [hgb] 耶 和 华 说 ， 我 知 道 他 的 忿 怒 是 虚 空 的 。 他 夸 大 的 话 一 无 所 成 。 [kjv] I know his wrath, saith the LORD; but it shall not be so; his lies shall not so effect it. [bbe] I have knowledge of his wrath, says the Lord, that it is nothing; his high-sounding words have done nothing. 48:31 [hgb] 因 此 ， 我 要 为 摩 押 哀 号 ， 为 摩 押 全 地 呼 喊 。 人 必 为 吉 珥 哈 列 设 人 叹 息 。 [kjv] Therefore will I howl for Moab, and I will cry out for all Moab; mine heart shall mourn for the men of Kirheres. [bbe] For this cause I will give cries of grief for Moab, crying out for Moab, even for all of it; I will be sorrowing for the men of Kir-heres. 48:32 [hgb] 西 比 玛 的 葡 萄 树 阿 ， 我 为 你 哀 哭 ， 甚 于 雅 谢 人 哀 哭 。 你 的 枝 子 蔓 延 过 海 ， 直 长 到 雅 谢 海 。 那 行 毁 灭 的 已 经 临 到 你 夏 天 的 果 子 和 你 所 摘 的 葡 萄 。 [kjv] O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for thee with the weeping of Jazer: thy plants are gone over the sea, they reach even to the sea of Jazer: the spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage. [bbe] My weeping for you, O vine of Sibmah, will be more than the weeping of Jazer: your branches have gone over the sea, stretching even to Jazer: destruction has come down on your summer fruits and your cut grapes. 48:33 [hgb] 肥 田 和 摩 押 地 的 欢 喜 快 乐 都 被 夺 去 。 我 使 酒 榨 的 酒 绝 流 ， 无 人 踹 酒 欢 呼 。 那 欢 呼 却 变 为 仇 敌 的 呐 喊 （ 原 文 作 那 欢 呼 却 不 是 欢 呼 ） 。 [kjv] And joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field, and from the land of Moab; and I have caused wine to fail from the winepresses: none shall tread with shouting; their shouting shall be no shouting. [bbe] All joy is gone; no longer are they glad for the fertile field and for the land of Moab; I have made the wine come to an end from the crushing vessels: no longer will the grapes be crushed with the sound of glad voices. 48:34 [hgb] 希 实 本 人 发 的 哀 声 达 到 以 利 亚 利 ， 直 达 到 雅 杂 。 从 琐 珥 达 到 何 罗 念 ， 直 到 伊 基 拉 施 利 施 亚 ， 因 为 宁 林 的 水 必 然 干 涸 。 [kjv] From the cry of Heshbon even unto Elealeh, and even unto Jahaz, have they uttered their voice, from Zoar even unto Horonaim, as an heifer of three years old: for the waters also of Nimrim shall be desolate. [bbe] The cry of Heshbon comes even to Elealeh; to Jahaz their voice is sounding; from Zoar even to Horonaim and to Eglath-shelishiyah: for the waters of Nimrim will become dry. 48:35 [hgb] 耶 和 华 说 ， 我 必 在 摩 押 地 使 那 在 丘 坛 献 祭 的 ， 和 那 向 他 的 神 烧 香 的 都 断 绝 了 。 [kjv] Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, saith the LORD, him that offereth in the high places, and him that burneth incense to his gods. [bbe] And I will put an end in Moab, says the Lord, to him who is making offerings in the high place and burning perfumes to his gods. 48:36 [hgb] 我 心 腹 为 摩 押 哀 鸣 如 箫 ， 我 心 肠 为 吉 珥 哈 列 设 人 也 是 如 此 ， 因 摩 押 人 所 得 的 财 物 都 灭 没 了 。 [kjv] Therefore mine heart shall sound for Moab like pipes, and mine heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kirheres: because the riches that he hath gotten are perished. [bbe] So my heart is sounding for Moab like the sound of pipes, and my heart is sounding like pipes for the men of Kir-heres: for the wealth he has got for himself has come to an end. 48:37 [hgb] 各 人 头 上 光 秃 ， 胡 须 剪 短 ， 手 有 划 伤 ， 腰 束 麻 布 。 [kjv] For every head shall be bald, and every beard clipped: upon all the hands shall be cuttings, and upon the loins sackcloth. [bbe] For everywhere the hair of the head and the hair of the face is cut off: on every hand there are wounds, and haircloth on every body. 48:38 [hgb] 在 摩 押 的 各 房 顶 上 和 街 市 上 处 处 有 人 哀 哭 。 因 我 打 碎 摩 押 ， 好 像 打 碎 无 人 喜 悦 的 器 皿 。 这 是 耶 和 华 说 的 。 [kjv] There shall be lamentation generally upon all the housetops of Moab, and in the streets thereof: for I have broken Moab like a vessel wherein is no pleasure, saith the LORD. [bbe] On all the house-tops of Moab and in its streets there is weeping everywhere; for Moab has been broken like a vessel in which there is no pleasure, says the Lord. 48:39 [hgb] 摩 押 何 等 毁 坏 。 何 等 哀 号 。 何 等 羞 愧 转 背 。 这 样 ， 摩 押 必 令 四 围 的 人 嗤 笑 惊 骇 。 [kjv] They shall howl, saying, How is it broken down! how hath Moab turned the back with shame! so shall Moab be a derision and a dismaying to all them about him. [bbe] How is it broken down! how is Moab\u0027s back turned in shame! so Moab will be a cause of sport and of fear to everyone round about him. 48:40 [hgb] 耶 和 华 如 此 说 ， 仇 敌 必 如 大 鹰 飞 起 ， 展 开 翅 膀 ， 攻 击 摩 押 。 [kjv] For thus saith the LORD; Behold, he shall fly as an eagle, and shall spread his wings over Moab. [bbe] For the Lord has said, See, he will come like an eagle in flight, stretching out his wings against Moab. 48:41 [hgb] 加 略 被 攻 取 ， 保 障 也 被 占 据 。 到 那 日 ， 摩 押 的 勇 士 心 中 疼 痛 如 临 产 的 妇 人 。 [kjv] Kerioth is taken, and the strong holds are surprised, and the mighty men\u0027s hearts in Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs. [bbe] Kerioth is taken, and the strong places have been forced, and the hearts of Moab\u0027s men of war in that day will be like the heart of a woman in birth-pains. 48:42 [hgb] 摩 押 必 被 毁 灭 ， 不 再 成 国 ， 因 她 向 耶 和 华 夸 大 。 [kjv] And Moab shall be destroyed from being a people, because he hath magnified himself against the LORD. [bbe] And Moab will come to an end as a people, because he has been lifting himself up against the Lord. 48:43 [hgb] 耶 和 华 说 ， 摩 押 的 居 民 哪 ， 恐 惧 ， 陷 坑 ， 网 罗 都 临 近 你 。 [kjv] Fear, and the pit, and the snare, shall be upon thee, O inhabitant of Moab, saith the LORD. [bbe] Fear and death and the net have come on you, O people of Moab, says the Lord. 48:44 [hgb] 躲 避 恐 惧 的 必 坠 入 陷 坑 。 从 陷 坑 上 来 的 必 被 网 罗 缠 住 。 因 我 必 使 追 讨 之 年 临 到 摩 押 。 这 是 耶 和 华 说 的 。 [kjv] He that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for I will bring upon it, even upon Moab, the year of their visitation, saith the LORD. [bbe] He who goes in flight from the fear will be overtaken by death; and he who gets free from death will be taken in the net: for I will make this come on Moab, even the year of their punishment, says the Lord. 48:45 [hgb] 躲 避 的 人 无 力 站 在 希 实 本 的 影 下 。 因 为 有 火 从 希 实 本 发 出 ， 有 火 焰 出 于 西 宏 的 城 ， 烧 尽 摩 押 的 角 和 哄 嚷 人 的 头 顶 。 [kjv] They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon because of the force: but a fire shall come forth out of Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, and shall devour the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones. [bbe] Those who went in flight from the fear are waiting under the shade of Heshbon: for a fire has gone out from Heshbon and a flame from the house of Sihon, burning up the pride of Moab and the crown of the head of the violent ones. 48:46 [hgb] 摩 押 阿 ， 你 有 祸 了 。 属 基 抹 的 民 灭 亡 了 。 因 你 的 众 子 都 被 掳 去 ， 你 的 众 女 也 被 掳 去 。 [kjv] Woe be unto thee, O Moab! the people of Chemosh perisheth: for thy sons are taken captives, and thy daughters captives. [bbe] Sorrow is yours, O Moab! the people of Chemosh are overcome: for your sons have been taken away as prisoners, and your daughters made servants. 48:47 [hgb] 耶 和 华 说 ， 到 末 后 ， 我 还 要 使 被 掳 的 摩 押 人 归 回 。 摩 押 受 审 判 的 话 到 此 为 止 。 [kjv] Yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter days, saith the LORD. Thus far is the judgment of Moab. [bbe] But still, I will let the fate of Moab be changed in the last days, says the Lord.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/128/1959.html","bookId":158,"book":{"id":158,"title":"耶利米书 Jeremiah","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 便 雅 悯 地 亚 拿 突 城 的 祭 司 中 ， 希 勒 家 的 儿 子 耶 利 米 的 话 记 在 下 面 。 [kjv] The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/128","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:20 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
