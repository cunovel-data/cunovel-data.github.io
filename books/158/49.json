These are the words of the Lord: Has Israel no sons? has he no one to take the heritage? why then has Milcom taken Gad for himself, putting his people in its towns? \n 49:2 [hgb] 耶 和 华 说 ， 日 子 将 到 ， 我 必 使 人 听 见 打 仗 的 喊 声 ， 是 攻 击 亚 扪 人 拉 巴 的 喊 声 。 拉 巴 要 成 为 乱 堆 。 属 她 的 乡 村 （ 原 文 作 女 子 ） 要 被 火 焚 烧 。 先 前 得 以 色 列 地 为 业 的 ， 此 时 以 色 列 倒 要 得 他 们 的 地 为 业 。 这 是 耶 和 华 说 的 。 \n [kjv] Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard in Rabbah of the Ammonites; and it shall be a desolate heap, and her daughters shall be burned with fire: then shall Israel be heir unto them that were his heirs, saith the LORD. \n [bbe] Because of this, see, the days are coming when I will have a cry of war sounded against Rabbah, the town of the children of Ammon; it will become a waste of broken walls, and her daughter-towns will be burned with fire: then Israel will take the heritage of those who took his heritage, says the Lord. \n 49:3 [hgb] 希 实 本 哪 ， 你 要 哀 号 ， 因 为 爱 地 变 为 荒 场 。 拉 巴 的 居 民 哪 （ 居 民 原 文 作 女 子 ） ， 要 呼 喊 ， 以 麻 布 束 腰 。 要 哭 号 ， 在 篱 笆 中 跑 来 跑 去 。 因 玛 勒 堪 和 属 他 的 祭 司 ， 首 领 要 一 同 被 掳 去 。 \n [kjv] Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled: cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro by the hedges; for their king shall go into captivity, and his priests and his princes together. \n [bbe] Make sounds of grief, O Heshbon, for Ai is wasted; give loud cries, O daughters of Rabbah, and put haircloth round you: give yourselves to weeping, running here and there and wounding yourselves; for Milcom will be taken prisoner together with his rulers and his priests. \n 49:4 [hgb] 背 道 的 民 哪 （ 民 原 文 作 女 子 ） ， 你 们 为 何 因 有 山 谷 ， 就 是 水 流 的 山 谷 夸 张 呢 ？ 为 何 倚 靠 财 宝 说 ， 谁 能 来 到 我 们 这 里 呢 ？ \n [kjv] Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O backsliding daughter? that trusted in her treasures, saying, Who shall come unto me? \n [bbe] Why are you lifted up in pride on account of your valleys, your flowing valley, O daughter ever turning away? who puts her faith in her wealth, saying, Who will come against me? \n 49:5 [hgb] 主 万 军 之 耶 和 华 说 ， 我 要 使 恐 吓 从 四 围 的 人 中 临 到 你 们 。 你 们 必 被 赶 出 ， 各 人 一 直 前 往 ， 没 有 人 收 聚 逃 民 。 \n [kjv] Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts, from all those that be about thee; and ye shall be driven out every man right forth; and none shall gather up him that wandereth. \n [bbe] See, I will send fear on you, says the Lord, the Lord of armies, from those who are round you on every side; you will be forced out, every man straight before him, and there will be no one to get together the wanderers. \n 49:6 [hgb] 后 来 我 还 要 使 被 掳 的 亚 扪 人 归 回 。 这 是 耶 和 华 说 的 。 \n [kjv] And afterward I will bring again the captivity of the children of Ammon, saith the LORD. \n [bbe] But after these things, I will let the fate of the children of Ammon be changed, says the Lord. \n 49:7 [hgb] 论 以 东 。 万 军 之 耶 和 华 如 此 说 ， 提 幔 中 再 没 有 智 慧 吗 ？ 明 哲 人 不 再 有 谋 略 吗 ？ 他 们 的 智 慧 尽 归 无 有 吗 ？ \n [kjv] Concerning Edom, thus saith the LORD of hosts; Is wisdom no more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished? \n [bbe] About Edom. This is what the Lord of armies has said. Is there no more wisdom in Teman? have wise suggestions come to an end among men of good sense? has their wisdom completely gone? \n 49:8 [hgb] 底 但 的 居 民 哪 ， 要 转 身 逃 跑 ， 住 在 深 密 处 。 因 为 我 向 以 扫 追 讨 的 时 候 ， 必 使 灾 殃 临 到 他 。 \n [kjv] Flee ye, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time that I will visit him. \n [bbe] Go in flight, go back, take cover in deep places, you who are living in Dedan; for I will send the fate of Edom on him, even the time of his punishment. \n 49:9 [hgb] 摘 葡 萄 的 若 来 到 他 那 里 ， 岂 不 剩 下 些 葡 萄 呢 ？ 盗 贼 若 夜 间 而 来 ， 岂 不 毁 坏 直 到 够 了 呢 ？ \n [kjv] If grapegatherers come to thee, would they not leave some gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, they will destroy till they have enough. \n [bbe] If men came to get your grapes, would they not let some be uncut on the vines? if thieves came by night, would they not make waste till they had enough? \n 49:10 [hgb] 我 却 使 以 扫 赤 露 ， 显 出 他 的 隐 密 处 。 他 不 能 自 藏 。 他 的 后 裔 ， 弟 兄 ， 邻 舍 尽 都 灭 绝 。 他 也 归 于 无 有 。 \n [kjv] But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is spoiled, and his brethren, and his neighbours, and he is not. \n [bbe] I have had Esau searched out, uncovering his secret places, so that he may not keep himself covered: his seed is wasted and has come to an end, and there is no help from his neighbours. \n 49:11 [hgb] 你 撇 下 孤 儿 ， 我 必 保 全 他 们 的 命 。 你 的 寡 妇 可 以 倚 靠 我 。 \n [kjv] Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and let thy widows trust in me. \n [bbe] Put in my care your children who have no father, and I will keep them safe; and let your widows put their faith in me. \n 49:12 [hgb] 耶 和 华 如 此 说 ， 原 不 该 喝 那 杯 的 一 定 要 喝 。 你 能 尽 免 刑 罚 吗 ？ 你 必 不 能 免 ， 一 定 要 喝 。 \n [kjv] For thus saith the LORD; Behold, they whose judgment was not to drink of the cup have assuredly drunken; and art thou he that shall altogether go unpunished? thou shalt not go unpunished, but thou shalt surely drink of it. \n [bbe] For the Lord has said, Those for whom the cup was not made ready will certainly be forced to take of it; and are you to go without punishment? you will not be without punishment, but will certainly be forced to take from the cup. \n 49:13 [hgb] 耶 和 华 说 ， 我 指 着 自 己 起 誓 ， 波 斯 拉 必 令 人 惊 骇 ， 羞 辱 ， 咒 诅 ， 并 且 荒 凉 。 她 的 一 切 城 邑 必 变 为 永 远 的 荒 场 。 \n [kjv] For I have sworn by myself, saith the LORD, that Bozrah shall become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes. \n [bbe] For I have taken an oath by myself, says the Lord, that Bozrah will become a cause of wonder, a name of shame, a waste and a curse; and all its towns will be waste places for ever. \n 49:14 [hgb] 我 从 耶 和 华 那 里 听 见 信 息 ， 并 有 使 者 被 差 往 列 国 去 ， 说 ， 你 们 聚 集 来 攻 击 以 东 ， 要 起 来 争 战 。 \n [kjv] I have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent unto the heathen, saying, Gather ye together, and come against her, and rise up to the battle. \n [bbe] Word has come to me from the Lord, and a representative has been sent to the nations, to say, Come together and go up against her, and take your places for the fight. \n 49:15 [hgb] 我 使 你 在 列 国 中 为 最 小 ， 在 世 人 中 被 藐 视 。 \n [kjv] For, lo, I will make thee small among the heathen, and despised among men. \n [bbe] For see, I have made you small among the nations, looked down on by men. \n 49:16 [hgb] 住 在 山 穴 中 据 守 山 顶 的 阿 ， 论 到 你 的 威 吓 ， 你 因 心 中 的 狂 傲 自 欺 。 你 虽 如 大 鹰 高 高 搭 窝 ， 我 却 从 那 里 拉 下 你 来 。 这 是 耶 和 华 说 的 。 \n [kjv] Thy terribleness hath deceived thee, and the pride of thine heart, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that holdest the height of the hill: though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle, I will bring thee down from thence, saith the LORD. \n [bbe] ... the pride of your heart has been a false hope, O you who are living in the cracks of the rock, keeping your place on the top of the hill: even if you made your living-place as high as the eagle, I would make you come down, says the Lord. \n 49:17 [hgb] 以 东 必 令 人 惊 骇 。 凡 经 过 的 人 就 受 惊 骇 ， 又 因 她 一 切 的 灾 祸 嗤 笑 。 \n [kjv] Also Edom shall be a desolation: every one that goeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof. \n [bbe] And Edom will become a cause of wonder: everyone who goes by will be overcome with wonder, and make sounds of fear at all her punishments. \n 49:18 [hgb] 耶 和 华 说 ， 必 无 人 住 在 那 里 ， 也 无 人 在 其 中 寄 居 ， 要 像 所 多 玛 ， 蛾 摩 拉 ， 和 邻 近 的 城 邑 倾 覆 的 时 候 一 样 。 \n [kjv] As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour cities thereof, saith the LORD, no man shall abide there, neither shall a son of man dwell in it. \n [bbe] As at the downfall of Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighbouring towns, says the Lord, no man will be living in it, no son of man will have a resting-place there. \n 49:19 [hgb] 仇 敌 必 像 狮 子 从 约 旦 河 边 的 丛 林 上 来 ， 攻 击 坚 固 的 居 所 。 转 眼 之 间 ， 我 要 使 以 东 人 逃 跑 ， 离 开 这 地 。 谁 蒙 拣 选 ， 我 就 派 谁 治 理 这 地 。 谁 能 比 我 呢 ？ 谁 能 给 我 定 规 日 期 呢 ？ 有 何 牧 人 能 在 我 面 前 站 立 得 住 呢 ？ \n [kjv] Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan against the habitation of the strong: but I will suddenly make him run away from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over her? for who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that shepherd that will stand before me? \n [bbe] See, he will come up like a lion from the thick growth of Jordan against the resting-place of Teman: but I will suddenly make him go in flight from her; and I will put over her the man of my selection: for who is like me? and who will put forward his cause against me? and what keeper of sheep will be able to keep his place before me? \n 49:20 [hgb] 你 们 要 听 耶 和 华 攻 击 以 东 所 说 的 谋 略 和 他 攻 击 提 幔 居 民 所 定 的 旨 意 。 仇 敌 定 要 将 他 们 群 众 微 弱 的 拉 去 ， 定 要 使 他 们 的 居 所 荒 凉 。 \n [kjv] Therefore hear the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against Edom; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make their habitations desolate with them. \n [bbe] For this cause give ear to the decision of the Lord which he has made against Edom, and to his purposes designed against the people of Teman: Truly, they will be pulled away by the smallest of the flock; truly, he will make waste their fields with them. \n 49:21 [hgb] 因 他 们 仆 倒 的 声 音 ， 地 就 震 动 。 人 在 红 海 那 里 必 听 见 呼 喊 的 声 音 。 \n [kjv] The earth is moved at the noise of their fall, at the cry the noise thereof was heard in the Red sea. \n [bbe] The earth is shaking with the noise of their fall; their cry is sounding in the Red Sea. \n 49:22 [hgb] 仇 敌 必 如 大 鹰 飞 起 ， 展 开 翅 膀 攻 击 波 斯 拉 。 到 那 日 ， 以 东 的 勇 士 心 中 疼 痛 如 临 产 的 妇 人 。 \n [kjv] Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread his wings over Bozrah: and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men of Edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs. \n [bbe] See, he will come up like an eagle in flight, stretching out his wings against Bozrah: and the hearts of Edom\u0027s men of war on that day will be like the heart of a woman in birth-pains. \n 49:23 [hgb] 论 大 马 色 。 哈 马 和 亚 珥 拔 蒙 羞 ， 因 他 们 听 见 凶 恶 的 信 息 就 消 化 了 。 海 上 有 忧 愁 ， 不 得 平 静 。 \n [kjv] Concerning Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad: for they have heard evil tidings: they are fainthearted; there is sorrow on the sea; it cannot be quiet. \n [bbe] About Damascus. Hamath is put to shame, and Arpad; for the word of evil has come to their ears, their heart in its fear is turned to water, it will not be quiet. \n 49:24 [hgb] 大 马 色 发 软 ， 转 身 逃 跑 。 战 兢 将 她 捉 住 。 痛 苦 忧 愁 将 她 抓 住 ， 如 产 难 的 妇 人 一 样 。 \n [kjv] Damascus is waxed feeble, and turneth herself to flee, and fear hath seized on her: anguish and sorrows have taken her, as a woman in travail. \n [bbe] Damascus has become feeble, she is turned to flight, fear has taken her in its grip: pain and sorrows have come on her, as on a woman in birth-pains. \n 49:25 [hgb] 我 所 喜 乐 可 称 赞 的 城 ， 为 何 被 撇 弃 了 呢 ？ \n [kjv] How is the city of praise not left, the city of my joy! \n [bbe] How has the town of praise been wasted, the place of joy! \n 49:26 [hgb] 她 的 少 年 人 必 仆 倒 在 街 上 。 当 那 日 ， 一 切 兵 丁 必 默 默 无 声 。 这 是 万 军 之 耶 和 华 说 的 。 \n [kjv] Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD of hosts. \n [bbe] So her young men will be falling in her streets, and all the men of war will be cut off in that day, says the Lord of armies. \n 49:27 [hgb] 我 必 在 大 马 色 城 中 使 火 着 起 ， 烧 灭 便 哈 达 的 宫 殿 。 \n [kjv] And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall consume the palaces of Benhadad. \n [bbe] And I will have a fire lighted on the wall of Damascus, burning up the great houses of Ben-hadad. \n 49:28 [hgb] 论 巴 比 伦 王 尼 布 甲 尼 撒 所 攻 打 的 基 达 和 夏 琐 的 诸 国 。 耶 和 华 如 此 说 ， 迦 勒 底 人 哪 ， 起 来 上 基 达 去 ， 毁 灭 东 方 人 。 \n [kjv] Concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon shall smite, thus saith the LORD; Arise ye, go up to Kedar, and spoil the men of the east. \n [bbe] About Kedar and the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, overcame. This is what the Lord has said: Up! go against Kedar, and make an attack on the children of the east. \n 49:29 [hgb] 他 们 的 帐 棚 和 羊 群 都 要 夺 去 ， 将 幔 子 和 一 切 器 皿 ， 并 骆 驼 为 自 己 掠 去 。 人 向 他 们 喊 着 说 ， 四 围 都 有 惊 吓 。 \n [kjv] Their tents and their flocks shall they take away: they shall take to themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels; and they shall cry unto them, Fear is on every side. \n [bbe] Their tents and their flocks they will take; they will take away for themselves their curtains and all their vessels and their camels: they will give a cry to them, Fear on every side. \n 49:30 [hgb] 耶 和 华 说 ， 夏 琐 的 居 民 哪 ， 要 逃 奔 远 方 ， 住 在 深 密 处 。 因 为 巴 比 伦 王 尼 布 甲 尼 撒 设 计 谋 害 你 们 ， 起 意 攻 击 你 们 。 \n [kjv] Flee, get you far off, dwell deep, O ye inhabitants of Hazor, saith the LORD; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you, and hath conceived a purpose against you. \n [bbe] Go in flight, go wandering far off, take cover in deep places, O people of Hazor, says the Lord; for Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, has made a design against you, he has a purpose against you in mind. \n 49:31 [hgb] 耶 和 华 说 ， 迦 勒 底 人 哪 ， 起 来 。 上 安 逸 无 虑 的 居 民 那 里 去 。 他 们 是 无 门 无 闩 ， 独 自 居 住 的 。 \n [kjv] Arise, get you up unto the wealthy nation, that dwelleth without care, saith the LORD, which have neither gates nor bars, which dwell alone. \n [bbe] Up! go against a nation which is living in comfort and without fear of danger, says the Lord, without doors or locks, living by themselves. \n 49:32 [hgb] 他 们 的 骆 驼 必 成 为 掠 物 。 他 们 众 多 的 牲 畜 必 成 为 掳 物 。 我 必 将 剃 周 围 头 发 的 人 分 散 四 方 （ 方 原 文 作 风 ） ， 使 灾 殃 从 四 围 临 到 他 们 。 这 是 耶 和 华 说 的 。 \n [kjv] And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a spoil: and I will scatter into all winds them that are in the utmost corners; and I will bring their calamity from all sides thereof, saith the LORD. \n [bbe] And their camels will be taken from them by force, and their great herds will come into the hands of their attackers: those who have the ends of their hair cut I will send in flight to all the winds; and I will send their fate on them from every side, says the Lord. \n 49:33 [hgb] 夏 琐 必 成 为 野 狗 的 住 处 ， 永 远 凄 凉 。 必 无 人 住 在 那 里 ， 也 无 人 在 其 中 寄 居 。 \n [kjv] And Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons, and a desolation for ever: there shall no man abide there, nor any son of man dwell in it. \n [bbe] And Hazor will be a hole for jackals, a waste for ever: no one will be living in it, and no son of man will have a resting-place there. \n 49:34 [hgb] 犹 大 王 西 底 家 登 基 的 时 候 ， 耶 和 华 论 以 拦 的 话 临 到 先 知 耶 利 米 说 ， \n [kjv] The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against Elam in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying, \n [bbe] The word of the Lord which came to Jeremiah the prophet about Elam, when Zedekiah first became king of Judah, saying, \n 49:35 [hgb] 万 军 之 耶 和 华 如 此 说 ， 我 必 折 断 以 拦 人 的 弓 ， 就 是 他 们 为 首 的 权 力 。 \n [kjv] Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the chief of their might. \n [bbe] This is what the Lord of armies has said: See, I will have the bow of Elam, their chief strength, broken. \n 49:36 [hgb] 我 要 使 四 风 从 天 的 四 方 刮 来 ， 临 到 以 拦 人 ， 将 他 们 分 散 四 方 （ 方 原 文 作 风 ） 。 这 被 赶 散 的 人 没 有 一 国 不 到 的 。 \n [kjv] And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall not come. \n [bbe] And I will send on Elam four winds from the four quarters of heaven, driving them out to all those winds; there will be no nation into which the wanderers from Elam do not come. \n 49:37 [hgb] 耶 和 华 说 ， 我 必 使 以 拦 人 在 仇 敌 和 寻 索 其 命 的 人 面 前 惊 惶 。 我 也 必 使 灾 祸 ， 就 是 我 的 烈 怒 临 到 他 们 ， 又 必 使 刀 剑 追 杀 他 们 ， 直 到 将 他 们 灭 尽 。 \n [kjv] For I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before them that seek their life: and I will bring evil upon them, even my fierce anger, saith the LORD; and I will send the sword after them, till I have consumed them: \n [bbe] And I will let Elam be broken before their haters, and before those who are making designs against their lives: I will send evil on them, even my burning wrath, says the Lord; and I will send the sword after them till I have put an end to them: \n 49:38 [hgb] 我 要 在 以 拦 设 立 我 的 宝 座 ， 从 那 里 除 灭 君 王 和 首 领 。 这 是 耶 和 华 说 的 。 \n [kjv] And I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from thence the king and the princes, saith the LORD. \n [bbe] I will put the seat of my power in Elam, and in Elam I will put an end to kings and rulers, says the Lord. \n 49:39 [hgb] 到 末 后 ， 我 还 要 使 被 掳 的 以 拦 人 归 回 。 这 是 耶 和 华 说 的 。 \n [kjv] But it shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring again the captivity of Elam, saith the LORD. \n [bbe] But it will come about that, in the last days, I will let the fate of Elam be changed, says the Lord. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/128/1960.html","bookId":158,"book":{"id":158,"title":"耶利米书 Jeremiah","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 便 雅 悯 地 亚 拿 突 城 的 祭 司 中 ， 希 勒 家 的 儿 子 耶 利 米 的 话 记 在 下 面 。 [kjv] The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/128","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:20 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
