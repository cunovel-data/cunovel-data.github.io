[bbe] Now it came about in the seventh month that Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the king\u0027s seed, having with him ten men, came to Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, in Mizpah; and they had a meal together in Mizpah. 41:2 [hgb] 尼 探 雅 的 儿 子 以 实 玛 利 和 同 他 来 的 那 十 个 人 起 来 ， 用 刀 杀 了 沙 番 的 孙 子 亚 希 甘 的 儿 子 基 大 利 ， 就 是 巴 比 伦 王 所 立 为 全 地 省 长 的 。 [kjv] Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land. [bbe] Then Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men who were with him, got up, and attacking Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, with the sword, put to death him whom the king of Babylon had made ruler over the land. 41:3 [hgb] 以 实 玛 利 又 杀 了 在 米 斯 巴 ， 基 大 利 那 里 的 一 切 犹 大 人 和 所 遇 见 的 迦 勒 底 兵 丁 。 [kjv] Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him, even with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found there, and the men of war. [bbe] And Ishmael put to death all the Jews who were with him, even with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldaean men of war. 41:4 [hgb] 他 杀 了 基 大 利 ， 无 人 知 道 。 [kjv] And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah, and no man knew it, [bbe] Now on the second day after he had put Gedaliah to death, when no one had knowledge of it, 41:5 [hgb] 第 二 天 ， 有 八 十 人 从 示 剑 和 示 罗 ， 并 撒 玛 利 亚 来 ， 胡 须 剃 去 ， 衣 服 撕 裂 ， 身 体 划 破 ， 手 拿 素 祭 和 乳 香 ， 要 奉 到 耶 和 华 的 殿 。 [kjv] That there came certain from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even fourscore men, having their beards shaven, and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with offerings and incense in their hand, to bring them to the house of the LORD. [bbe] Some people came from Shechem, from Shiloh and Samaria, eighty men, with the hair of their faces cut off and their clothing out of order, and with cuts on their bodies, and in their hands meal offerings and perfumes which they were taking to the house of the Lord. 41:6 [hgb] 尼 探 雅 的 儿 子 以 实 玛 利 出 米 斯 巴 迎 接 他 们 ， 随 走 随 哭 。 遇 见 了 他 们 ， 就 对 他 们 说 ， 你 们 可 以 来 见 亚 希 甘 的 儿 子 基 大 利 。 [kjv] And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass, as he met them, he said unto them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. [bbe] And Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, went out from Mizpah with the purpose of meeting them, weeping on his way: and it came about that when he was face to face with them he said, Come to Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam. 41:7 [hgb] 他 们 到 了 城 中 ， 尼 探 雅 的 儿 子 以 实 玛 利 和 同 着 他 的 人 就 将 他 们 杀 了 ， 抛 在 坑 中 。 [kjv] And it was so, when they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them, and cast them into the midst of the pit, he, and the men that were with him. [bbe] And when they came inside the town, Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, and the men who were with him, put them to death and put their bodies into a deep hole. 41:8 [hgb] 只 是 他 们 中 间 有 十 个 人 对 以 实 玛 利 说 ， 不 要 杀 我 们 ， 因 为 我 们 有 许 多 大 麦 ， 小 麦 ， 油 ， 蜜 藏 在 田 间 。 于 是 他 住 了 手 ， 没 有 将 他 们 杀 在 弟 兄 中 间 。 [kjv] But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael, Slay us not: for we have treasures in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he forbare, and slew them not among their brethren. [bbe] But there were ten men among them who said to Ishmael, Do not put us to death, for we have secret stores, in the country, of grain and oil and honey. So he did not put them to death with their countrymen. 41:9 [hgb] 以 实 玛 利 将 所 杀 之 人 的 尸 首 都 抛 在 坑 里 基 大 利 的 旁 边 。 这 坑 是 从 前 亚 撒 王 因 怕 以 色 列 王 巴 沙 所 挖 的 。 尼 探 雅 的 儿 子 以 实 玛 利 将 那 些 被 杀 的 人 填 满 了 坑 。 [kjv] Now the pit wherein Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men, whom he had slain because of Gedaliah, was it which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with them that were slain. [bbe] Now the hole into which Ishmael had put the dead bodies of the men whom he had put to death, was the great hole which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha, king of Israel: and Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, made it full of the bodies of those who had been put to death. 41:10 [hgb] 以 实 玛 利 将 米 斯 巴 剩 下 的 人 ， 就 是 众 公 主 和 仍 住 在 米 斯 巴 所 有 的 百 姓 ， 原 是 护 卫 长 尼 布 撒 拉 旦 交 给 亚 希 甘 的 儿 子 基 大 利 的 ， 都 掳 去 了 。 尼 探 雅 的 儿 子 以 实 玛 利 掳 了 他 们 ， 要 往 亚 扪 人 那 里 去 。 [kjv] Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that were in Mizpah, even the king\u0027s daughters, and all the people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the Ammonites. [bbe] Then Ishmael took away as prisoners all the rest of the people who were in Mizpah, the king\u0027s daughters and all the people still in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan, the captain of the armed men, had put under the care of Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam: Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, took them away prisoners with the purpose of going over to the children of Ammon. 41:11 [hgb] 加 利 亚 的 儿 子 约 哈 难 ， 和 同 着 他 的 众 军 长 ， 听 见 尼 探 雅 的 儿 子 以 实 玛 利 所 行 的 一 切 恶 ， [kjv] But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done, [bbe] But when Johanan, the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the armed forces who were with him, had news of all the evil which Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, had done, 41:12 [hgb] 就 带 领 众 人 前 往 ， 要 和 尼 探 雅 的 儿 子 以 实 玛 利 争 战 ， 在 基 遍 的 大 水 旁 （ 或 作 大 水 池 旁 ） 遇 见 他 。 [kjv] Then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon. [bbe] They took their men and went out to make war on Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, and they came face to face with him by the great waters in Gibeon. 41:13 [hgb] 以 实 玛 利 那 里 的 众 人 看 见 加 利 亚 的 儿 子 约 哈 难 和 同 着 他 的 众 军 长 ， 就 都 欢 喜 。 [kjv] Now it came to pass, that when all the people which were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, then they were glad. [bbe] Now when all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan, the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces with him, then they were glad. 41:14 [hgb] 这 样 ， 以 实 玛 利 从 米 斯 巴 所 掳 去 的 众 人 都 转 身 归 加 利 亚 的 儿 子 约 哈 难 去 了 。 [kjv] So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah cast about and returned, and went unto Johanan the son of Kareah. [bbe] And all the people whom Ishmael had taken away prisoners from Mizpah, turning round, came back and went to Johanan, the son of Kareah. 41:15 [hgb] 尼 探 雅 的 儿 子 以 实 玛 利 和 八 个 人 脱 离 约 哈 难 的 手 ， 逃 往 亚 扪 人 那 里 去 了 。 [kjv] But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the Ammonites. [bbe] But Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, got away from Johanan, with eight men, and went to the children of Ammon. 41:16 [hgb] 尼 探 雅 的 儿 子 以 实 玛 利 杀 了 亚 希 甘 的 儿 子 基 大 利 ， 从 米 斯 巴 将 剩 下 的 一 切 百 姓 ， 兵 丁 ， 妇 女 ， 孩 童 ， 太 监 掳 到 基 遍 之 后 ， 加 利 亚 的 儿 子 约 哈 难 和 同 着 他 的 众 军 长 将 他 们 都 夺 回 来 ， [kjv] Then took Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after that he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, even mighty men of war, and the women, and the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought again from Gibeon: [bbe] Then Johanan, the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, took all the rest of the people whom Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, had made prisoners, after he had put to death Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, the people from Mizpah, that is, the men of war and the women and the children and the unsexed servants, whom he had taken back with him from Gibeon: 41:17 [hgb] 带 到 靠 近 伯 利 恒 的 金 罕 寓 （ 或 作 基 罗 特 金 罕 ） 住 下 ， 要 进 入 埃 及 去 。 [kjv] And they departed, and dwelt in the habitation of Chimham, which is by Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt, [bbe] And they went and were living in the resting-place of Chimham, which is near Beth-lehem on the way into Egypt, 41:18 [hgb] 因 为 尼 探 雅 的 儿 子 以 实 玛 利 杀 了 巴 比 伦 王 所 立 为 省 长 的 亚 希 甘 的 儿 子 基 大 利 ， 约 哈 难 惧 怕 迦 勒 底 人 。 [kjv] Because of the Chaldeans: for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor in the land. [bbe] Because of the Chaldaeans: for they were in fear of them because Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, had put to death Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon had made ruler over the land.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/128/1952.html","bookId":158,"book":{"id":158,"title":"耶利米书 Jeremiah","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 便 雅 悯 地 亚 拿 突 城 的 祭 司 中 ， 希 勒 家 的 儿 子 耶 利 米 的 话 记 在 下 面 。 [kjv] The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/128","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:20 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
