\n [bbe] So you are to say this word to them: This is the word of the Lord, the God of Israel: Every skin bottle will be full of wine; and they will say to you, Is it not quite clear to us that every skin bottle will be full of wine? \n 13:13 [hgb] 你 就 要 对 他 们 说 ， 耶 和 华 如 此 说 ， 我 必 使 这 地 的 一 切 居 民 ， 就 是 坐 大 卫 宝 座 的 君 王 和 祭 司 ， 与 先 知 ， 并 耶 路 撒 冷 的 一 切 居 民 ， 都 酩 酊 大 醉 。 \n [kjv] Then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings that sit upon David\u0027s throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness. \n [bbe] Then you are to say to them, The Lord has said, I will make all the people of this land, even the kings seated on David\u0027s seat, and the priests and the prophets and all the people of Jerusalem, overcome with strong drink. \n 13:14 [hgb] 耶 和 华 说 ， 我 要 使 他 们 彼 此 相 碰 ， 就 是 父 与 子 彼 此 相 碰 。 我 必 不 可 怜 ， 不 顾 惜 ， 不 怜 悯 ， 以 致 灭 绝 他 们 。 \n [kjv] And I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together, saith the LORD: I will not pity, nor spare, nor have mercy, but destroy them. \n [bbe] I will have them smashed against one another, fathers and sons together, says the Lord: I will have no pity or mercy, I will have no feeling for them to keep me from giving them to destruction. \n 13:15 [hgb] 你 们 当 听 ， 当 侧 耳 而 听 。 不 要 骄 傲 ， 因 为 耶 和 华 已 经 说 了 。 \n [kjv] Hear ye, and give ear; be not proud: for the LORD hath spoken. \n [bbe] Give ear and let your ears be open; be not lifted up: for these are the words of the Lord. \n 13:16 [hgb] 耶 和 华 你 们 的 神 未 使 黑 暗 来 到 ， 你 们 的 脚 未 在 昏 暗 山 上 绊 跌 之 先 ， 当 将 荣 耀 归 给 他 。 免 得 你 们 盼 望 光 明 ， 他 使 光 明 变 为 死 荫 ， 成 为 幽 暗 。 \n [kjv] Give glory to the LORD your God, before he cause darkness, and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains, and, while ye look for light, he turn it into the shadow of death, and make it gross darkness. \n [bbe] Give glory to the Lord your God, before he makes it dark, and before your feet are slipping on the dark mountains, and, while you are looking for a light, he makes it into deep dark, into black night. \n 13:17 [hgb] 你 们 若 不 听 这 话 ， 我 必 因 你 们 的 骄 傲 在 暗 地 哭 泣 。 我 眼 必 痛 哭 流 泪 ， 因 为 耶 和 华 的 群 众 被 掳 去 了 。 \n [kjv] But if ye will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret places for your pride; and mine eye shall weep sore, and run down with tears, because the LORD\u0027s flock is carried away captive. \n [bbe] But if you do not give ear to it, my soul will be weeping in secret for your pride; my eye will be weeping bitterly, streaming with water, because the Lord\u0027s flock has been taken away as prisoners. \n 13:18 [hgb] 你 要 对 君 王 和 太 后 说 ， 你 们 当 自 卑 ， 坐 在 下 边 。 因 你 们 的 头 巾 ， 就 是 你 们 的 华 冠 ， 已 经 脱 落 了 。 \n [kjv] Say unto the king and to the queen, Humble yourselves, sit down: for your principalities shall come down, even the crown of your glory. \n [bbe] Say to the king and to the queen-mother, Make yourselves low, be seated on the earth: for the crown of your glory has come down from your heads. \n 13:19 [hgb] 南 方 的 城 尽 都 关 闭 ， 无 人 开 放 。 犹 大 全 被 掳 掠 ， 且 掳 掠 净 尽 。 \n [kjv] The cities of the south shall be shut up, and none shall open them: Judah shall be carried away captive all of it, it shall be wholly carried away captive. \n [bbe] The towns of the south are shut up, and there is no one to make them open: Judah is taken away as prisoners; all Judah is taken away as prisoners. \n 13:20 [hgb] 你 们 要 举 目 观 看 从 北 方 来 的 人 。 先 前 赐 给 你 的 群 众 ， 就 是 你 佳 美 的 群 众 ， 如 今 在 哪 里 呢 ？ \n [kjv] Lift up your eyes, and behold them that come from the north: where is the flock that was given thee, thy beautiful flock? \n [bbe] Let your eyes be lifted up (O Jerusalem), and see those who are coming from the north. Where is the flock which was given to you, your beautiful flock? \n 13:21 [hgb] 耶 和 华 立 你 自 己 所 交 的 朋 友 为 首 ， 辖 制 你 ， 那 时 你 还 有 什 么 话 说 呢 ？ 痛 苦 岂 不 将 你 抓 住 像 产 难 的 妇 人 吗 ？ \n [kjv] What wilt thou say when he shall punish thee? for thou hast taught them to be captains, and as chief over thee: shall not sorrows take thee, as a woman in travail? \n [bbe] What will you say when he puts over you those whom you yourself have made your friends? will not pains take you like a woman in childbirth? \n 13:22 [hgb] 你 若 心 里 说 ， 这 一 切 事 为 何 临 到 我 呢 ？ 你 的 衣 襟 揭 起 ， 你 的 脚 跟 受 伤 ， 是 因 你 的 罪 孽 甚 多 。 \n [kjv] And if thou say in thine heart, Wherefore come these things upon me? For the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts discovered, and thy heels made bare. \n [bbe] And if you say in your heart, Why have these things come on me? because of the number of your sins, your skirts have been uncovered and violent punishment overtakes you. \n 13:23 [hgb] 古 实 人 岂 能 改 变 皮 肤 呢 ？ 豹 岂 能 改 变 斑 点 呢 ？ 若 能 ， 你 们 这 习 惯 行 恶 的 便 能 行 善 了 。 \n [kjv] Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil. \n [bbe] Is it possible for the skin of the Ethiopian to be changed, or the markings on the leopard? Then it might be possible for you to do good, who have been trained to do evil. \n 13:24 [hgb] 所 以 我 必 用 旷 野 的 风 吹 散 他 们 ， 像 吹 过 的 碎 秸 一 样 。 \n [kjv] Therefore will I scatter them as the stubble that passeth away by the wind of the wilderness. \n [bbe] So I will send them in all directions, as dry grass is taken away by the wind of the waste land. \n 13:25 [hgb] 耶 和 华 说 ， 这 是 你 所 当 得 的 ， 是 我 量 给 你 的 分 。 因 为 你 忘 记 我 ， 倚 靠 虚 假 （ 或 作 偶 像 ） 。 \n [kjv] This is thy lot, the portion of thy measures from me, saith the LORD; because thou hast forgotten me, and trusted in falsehood. \n [bbe] This is your fate, the part measured out to you by me, says the Lord, because you have put me out of your memory and put your faith in what is false. \n 13:26 [hgb] 所 以 我 要 揭 起 你 的 衣 襟 ， 蒙 在 你 脸 上 ， 显 出 你 的 丑 陋 。 \n [kjv] Therefore will I discover thy skirts upon thy face, that thy shame may appear. \n [bbe] So I will have your skirts uncovered before your face, in order that your shame may be seen. \n 13:27 [hgb] 你 那 些 可 憎 恶 之 事 就 是 在 田 野 的 山 上 行 奸 淫 ， 发 嘶 声 ， 作 淫 乱 的 事 我 都 看 见 了 。 耶 路 撒 冷 阿 ， 你 有 祸 了 。 你 不 肯 洁 净 ， 还 要 到 几 时 呢 ？ \n [kjv] I have seen thine adulteries, and thy neighings, the lewdness of thy whoredom, and thine abominations on the hills in the fields. Woe unto thee, O Jerusalem! wilt thou not be made clean? when shall it once be? \n [bbe] I have seen your disgusting acts, even your false behaviour and your cries of desire and your loose ways on the hills in the field. Unhappy are you, O Jerusalem, you have no desire to be made clean; how long will you be in turning back to me? \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/128/1924.html","bookId":158,"book":{"id":158,"title":"耶利米书 Jeremiah","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 便 雅 悯 地 亚 拿 突 城 的 祭 司 中 ， 希 勒 家 的 儿 子 耶 利 米 的 话 记 在 下 面 。 [kjv] The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/128","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:20 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
