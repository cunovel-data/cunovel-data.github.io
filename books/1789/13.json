{"id":78313,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"\"I knew it,\" Alesandra cried out. She clasped her hands together as though in prayer and turned to frown at Colin. \"Didn\u0027t I tell you so?\"\n Her enthusiasm made him smile. \"Tell me what?\"\n \"That Lady Victoria wouldn\u0027t elope. Your director has just confirmed my suspicions.\"\n \"Now, Princess, it\u0027s still a possibility—remote, of course—that she did marry there. Both Elliott and Laing keep accurate records so each can boast the number of weddings performed. It\u0027s a competitive thing, you see. However, they aren\u0027t the only men in Gretna Green who can marry a couple. Some less reputable gents just don\u0027t bother with records. They would fill out the certificate and hand it over to the husband. So you see, my dear, she still could have eloped after all.\"\n \"She didn\u0027t.\"\n Alesandra was emphatic in that belief. Colin shook his head. \"She\u0027s stirring up a hornet\u0027s nest, Richards. I\u0027ve told her to leave it alone but she won\u0027t listen to me.\"\n She frowned at Colin. \"I am not stirring anything up.\"\n \"Yes, you are,\" Colin replied. \"You\u0027re going to cause Victoria\u0027s family additional heartache if you pester them with questions.\"\n His criticism stung. She bowed her head. \"You must have a low opinion of me if you believe I would deliberately set out to hurt anyone.\"\n \"You didn\u0027t have to be so harsh with her, son.\"\n Colin was exasperated. \"I wasn\u0027t being harsh, just honest.\"\n Sir Richards shook his head. Alesandra smiled at the director. She was pleased he\u0027d taken her side.\n \"If he would only listen to my reasons for being worried, Sir Richards, he wouldn\u0027t be so quick to call my concern interference.\"\n The director glared at Colin. \"You wouldn\u0027t listen to her reasons? She makes a sound argument, Colin. You shouldn\u0027t judge without knowing all the facts.\"\n \"Thank you, Sir Richards.\" Colin snorted.\n Alesandra decided to ignore the rude man. \"What is our next step in this investigation?\" she asked the director.\n Sir Richards looked a bit confused. \"Investigation? I hadn\u0027t thought of the problem in that light…\"\n \"You said you would help me,\" she reminded the director. \"You mustn\u0027t become discouraged so quickly.\"\n Sir Richards looked to Colin for assistance. Colin grinned.\n \"It isn\u0027t a matter of giving up,\" Sir Richards said. \"I\u0027m just not certain what it is I\u0027m investigating. It\u0027s a plain fact your friend did run off with someone and I believe Colin\u0027s correct when he suggests you let the matter go.\"\n \"Why is it a plain fact?\"\n \"Victoria left a note,\" Sir Richards explained.\n She shook her head. \"Anyone could have written a note.\"\n \"Yes, but…\"\n \"I had so hoped you would help me, Sir Richards,\" she interrupted. Her tone of voice sounded forlorn. \"You were my last hope. Victoria could be in danger and she only has you and me to help her. If anyone can ferret out the truth, it\u0027s you. You\u0027re so intelligent and clever.\"\n Sir Richards puffed up like a rooster. Colin had to shake his head. One compliment had turned the man into mush.\n \"Will you be satisfied if I can find a record of the marriage?\"\n \"You won\u0027t find one.\"\n \"But if I do…\"\n \"I\u0027ll let the matter rest.\"\n Sir Richards nodded. \"Very well,\" he agreed. \"I\u0027ll start with her family. I\u0027ll send a man around tomorrow to talk to the brother. One way or another, I\u0027ll find out what happened.\"\n Her smile was radiant. \"Thank you so much,\" she whispered. \"I should warn you, though. I sent a note to Victoria\u0027s brother and he refused to grant me another audience. Colin, you see, was rude to him and he obviously hasn\u0027t forgiven him.\"\n \"He won\u0027t refuse me,\" Sir Richards announced with a hard nod.\n Colin had heard enough of what he considered a ridiculous topic. He didn\u0027t like the idea that the director of England\u0027s Security Section was lowering himself to snoop into another family\u0027s private affairs.\n He was about to change the subject when Sir Richards\u0027s next remark caught his attention. \"Princess Alesandra, after the cooperation you\u0027ve given, looking into this delicate matter is the very least I can do for you. Rest easy, my dear. I\u0027ll have some answers for you before you leave England.\"\n Colin leaned forward. \"Back up, Richards,\" he demanded, his voice hard. \"Exactly how has Alesandra cooperated?\"\n The director looked surprised by the question. \"She didn\u0027t explain to you…\"\n \"I didn\u0027t believe it was necessary,\" Alesandra blurted out. She hastily stood up. \"If you\u0027ll excuse me now, I\u0027ll leave you two gentlemen alone to discuss your business.\"\n \"Alesandra, sit down.\"\n Colin\u0027s tone suggested she not argue with him. She let out a little sigh and did as he ordered. She refused to look at him, however, and kept her gaze directed on her lap. She wanted to run and hide rather than talk about her decision, but that would be cowardly and irresponsible, and Colin deserved to know what had been decided.\n Dignity and decorum, she thought to herself. Colin would never know how upset she was, and there was a bit of victory in that, wasn\u0027t there?\n \"Explain to me why Richards is so pleased with your cooperation.\"\n \"I\u0027ve decided to return to my father\u0027s homeland,\" she explained in a bare whisper. \"I\u0027m going to marry the general. Your father has given his approval.\"\n Colin didn\u0027t say anything for a long while. He stared at Alesandra. She stared at her lap. \"All of this was decided while I was sick?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"Look at me,\" he commanded.\n She was close to bursting into tears. She took a deep breath and finally turned to look at him.\n Colin knew she was upset. She was twisting her hands together and trying not to cry.\n \"She wasn\u0027t coerced,\" Sir Richards interjected.\n \"The hell she wasn\u0027t.\"\n \"It was my decision,\" she insisted.\n Colin shook his head. \"Richards, nothing has been decided. Understand? Alesandra is still reacting to the incident last week. Her guard was injured and she feels responsible.\"\n \"I am responsible,\" she cried out.\n \"No,\" he countered, his voice emphatic. \"You were frightened.\"\n \"Does it matter what my reasons were?\"\n \"Hell, yes, it matters,\" he snapped. He turned his attention back to the director. \"Alesandra has obviously forgotten her promise to me last week.\"\n \"Colin…\"\n \"Be silent.\"\n Her eyes widened in disbelief. \"Be silent? This is my future under discussion, not yours.\"\n \"I\u0027m your guardian,\" he countered. \"I decide your future. You seem to have forgotten that fact.\"\n His scowl was as hot as the fire from a dragon\u0027s nostrils. She decided not to argue with him. He wasn\u0027t being at all reasonable, and if he didn\u0027t quit glaring at her she was definitely going to get up and leave the room.\n Colin turned his attention back to the director. \"Alesandra and I talked about this problem last week,\" he explained. \"We decided she wouldn\u0027t marry the general. You can tell your associates in finance the deal\u0027s off.\"\n Colin was so furious he barely noticed the director\u0027s nod of agreement as he continued on. \"She isn\u0027t going to marry him. The general sounds like a real sweetheart, doesn\u0027t he? He sent a gang of cutthroats to kidnap his bride for him. A hell of a courtship, wouldn\u0027t you say? How I wish he\u0027d come to England. I\u0027d like to have a few minutes alone with the bastard.\"\n Alesandra couldn\u0027t understand why Colin was getting so worked up. She had never seen him this angry. She was too astonished to be frightened. She didn\u0027t know what to say or do to calm him.\n \"He won\u0027t give up, Colin,\" she whispered, grimacing over the shiver in her voice. \"He\u0027ll send others.\"\n \"That\u0027s my problem, not yours.\"\n \"It is?\"\n The fear he glimpsed in her eyes took away some of his anger. He didn\u0027t want her to be afraid of him. He deliberately softened his voice when he answered her. \"Yes, it is.\"\n They stared at each other a long minute. The tenderness in his expression made her want to weep with relief. He wasn\u0027t going to let her leave England.\n She had to force herself to turn her gaze away from him so he wouldn\u0027t see the tears in her eyes. She stared at her lap, took a deep breath in an attempt to control her emotions, and then said, \"I was trying to be noble. I didn\u0027t want anyone else to get hurt and Sir Richards said there was a chance for better trade agreements…\"\n \"My associates believe the general would cooperate,\" Sir Richards interjected. \"I personally don\u0027t hold with that nonsense. I\u0027m of the same mind as Colin,\" he added with a nod. \"The general isn\u0027t a man to be trusted. So you see, my dear, you don\u0027t have to be noble.\"\n \"And if Colin gets hurt?\" she blurted out.\n Both Sir Richards and Colin were astonished by that question. The fear was back in Alesandra\u0027s expression. Colin leaned back in his chair and stared at her. She wasn\u0027t afraid for her own safety; no, she was worried about him. He probably should have been irritated with her. He could take care of himself, and it was a bit insulting to know she was worried about him.\n It was damned flattering, too.\n Sir Richards raised an eyebrow and looked at Colin, waiting for him to answer her.\n \"I can take care of myself,\" Colin said. \"I don\u0027t want you to worry, understand?\"\n \"Yes, Colin.\"\n Her immediate agreement pleased him. \"Leave us now, Alesandra. Richards and I have other matters to discuss.\"\n She couldn\u0027t get out of the room fast enough. She didn\u0027t even say good-bye to the director. Her conduct was most unladylike, but she didn\u0027t care. She was shaking so violently she could barely get the door closed behind her.\n Relief made her knees weak. She sagged against the wall and closed her eyes. A tear slipped down her cheek. She took a deep breath in an attempt to calm herself.\n She wasn\u0027t going to have to be noble and marry that horrible man after all. Colin had taken the decision out of her hands and she was so grateful she didn\u0027t mind at all that he\u0027d been so angry. For some reason she couldn\u0027t define, Colin had decided to take the duty of guardian to heart. He had acted like a protector, and Alesandra was so thankful to have someone on her side she said a prayer of thanksgiving.\n \"Princess Alesandra, are you all right?\"\n She jumped a good foot. Then she burst into laughter. Flannaghan and another man she\u0027d never met before stood just a few feet away from her. She\u0027d not even heard their approach.\n She could feel herself blushing. The stranger standing just behind the butler was smiling at her. She decided he probably thought she\u0027d lost her mind. Alesandra moved away from the wall, forced herself to quit laughing, and then said, \"I\u0027m quite all right.\"\n \"What were you doing?\"\n \"Reflecting,\" she replied. And praying, she silently added.\n Flannaghan didn\u0027t know what she meant by that remark. He continued to stare at her with a perplexed look on his face. She turned to their guest. \"Good evening, sir.\"\n The butler finally remembered his manners. \"Princess Alesandra, may I present Morgan Atkins, the Earl of Oakmount.\"\n Alesandra smiled in greeting. \"It is a pleasure to meet you.\"\n He moved forward and took hold of her hand. \"The pleasure is all mine, Princess. I\u0027ve been most eager to meet you.\"\n \"You have?\"\n He smiled over the surprise in her eyes. \"Yes, I have,\" he assured her. \"You\u0027re the talk of London, but I imagine you realize that.\"\n She shook her head. \"No, I didn\u0027t realize,\" she admitted.\n \"The prince regent has been singing your praises,\" Morgan explained. \"You mustn\u0027t frown, Princess. I\u0027ve only heard wonderful things about you.\"\n \"What wonderful things?\" Flannaghan dared to ask.\n Morgan didn\u0027t take his gaze away from Alesandra when he answered the butler. \"I was told she was very beautiful and now I know that story is true. She is beautiful—exquisite, in fact.\"\n She was embarrassed by his flattery. She tried to pull her hand away from his, but he wouldn\u0027t let go.\n \"You have a delightful blush, Princess,\" he told her. He moved closer, and in the candlelight she could see the handsome silver threads streaking his dark brown hair. His eyes, a deep black brown color, sparkled with his smile. Morgan wasn\u0027t much taller than Flannaghan, but he seemed to overwhelm the butler. The aura of power surrounding him was probably due to his important position in society, she guessed. His title allowed him to be arrogant and self-assured.\n The man was a charmer, however, who understood his own appeal. He knew he was making her uncomfortable under his close scrutiny, too.\n \"Are you enjoying your stay in England?\" he asked.\n \"Yes, thank you.\"\n Colin opened the door just as Morgan was asking Alesandra if he might be permitted to call on her the following afternoon. He immediately noticed Alesandra\u0027s blush. He noticed Morgan was holding her hand, too.\n He reacted before he could stop himself. He reached out, grabbed hold of Alesandra\u0027s arm, and jerked her into his side. Then he draped his arm around her shoulders in an action she found terribly possessive and frowned at their guest.\n \"Alesandra\u0027s going to be busy tomorrow,\" he announced. \"Go on inside, Morgan. The director\u0027s waiting to talk to you.\"\n Morgan didn\u0027t seem to notice the irritation in Colin\u0027s tone of voice, or if he did notice, he chose to ignore it. He nodded his agreement, then turned his attention back to her.\n \"With your permission, Princess, I\u0027ll continue to try to convince your cousin to let me call on you.\"\n As soon as she nodded agreement, he bowed to her and walked into the study.\n \"Do quit squeezing me, Cousin,\" Alesandra whispered.\n He heard the laughter in her voice and looked down at her. \"Where the hell did he get that idea? Did you tell him I was your cousin?\"\n \"No, of course I didn\u0027t,\" she replied. \"Will you unhand me now? I have to go back to my room to fetch my notecard.\"\n He wouldn\u0027t let go of her. \"Alesandra, why are you so damned happy?\"\n \"I\u0027m happy because it appears as though I won\u0027t have to marry the general,\" she said. She squirmed her way out of his grasp and went hurrying down the hallway. \"And,\" she called over her shoulder, \"I have a new name to put on my list.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/castles-crown-s-spies-4/page-13.html","bookId":1789,"book":{"id":1789,"title":"Castles (Crown\u0027s Spies #4)","description":"Storyline: \n Orphaned and besieged Princess Alesandra knew that only hasty marriage to an Englishman could protect her from the turmoil in her own land.
