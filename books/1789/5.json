He placed the pen and inkwell on a narrow side table, then picked up the table and carried it over to her. She thanked him, of course, and that bit of praise made him blush with pleasure. \"Close the doors behind you, Flannaghan,\" Colin ordered. \"I don\u0027t want to be interrupted.\" He was sounding irritated again. Alesandra let out a little sigh. Colin wasn\u0027t a very accommodating man. She turned her full attention to her host. \"I\u0027ve upset you. I really am sorry…\" He wouldn\u0027t let her finish her apology. \"You haven\u0027t upset me,\" he snapped. She would have laughed if she\u0027d been alone. The man was upset, and that was that. His jaw was clenched, and if that wasn\u0027t a giveaway to his true feelings, she didn\u0027t know what was. \"I see,\" she agreed just to placate him. \"However,\" he began in a clipped, no-nonsense tone of voice, \"I believe we should settle a few pertinent issues here and now. Why in heaven\u0027s name did you think I would marry you?\" \"Your father said you would.\" He didn\u0027t even try to hide his exasperation. \"I\u0027m a grown man, Alesandra. I make my own decisions.\" \"Yes, of course you\u0027re a grown man,\" she agreed. \"But you\u0027ll always be his son, Colin. It\u0027s your duty to do whatever he wants you to do. Sons must obey their fathers, no matter how old they are.\" \"That\u0027s ridiculous.\" She lifted her shoulders in a dainty shrug. Colin held on to his patience. \"I don\u0027t know what kind of bargain you struck with my father, and I\u0027m sorry if he made promises on my behalf, but I want you to understand I have no intention of marrying you.\" She lowered her gaze to the notecard she held in her hands. \"All right,\" she agreed. Her quick agreement, given in such a casual tone of voice, made him suspicious. \"You aren\u0027t angry over my refusal?\" \"No, of course not.\" She glanced up and smiled. Colin looked confused. \"I\u0027m disappointed,\" she admitted. \"But certainly not angry. I barely know you. It would be unreasonable for me to be angry.\" \"Exactly,\" he agreed with a quick nod. \"You don\u0027t know me. Why would you wish to marry me if you…\" \"I believe I\u0027ve already explained, sir. Your father instructed me to marry you.\" \"Alesandra, I want you to understand…\" She wouldn\u0027t let him finish. \"I accept your decision, sir.\" He smiled in spite of himself. Princess Alesandra looked so forlorn. \"You won\u0027t have any trouble finding someone suitable. You\u0027re a very beautiful woman, Princess.\" She shrugged. She was obviously unaffected by his compliment. \"I imagine it was difficult for you to ask me,\" he began then. She straightened her shoulders. \"I didn\u0027t ask,\" she announced. \"I simply explained to you what your father\u0027s primary objective was.\" \"His primary objective?\" He sounded as though he was laughing at her. She could feel herself blushing with embarrassment. \"Do not mock me, sir. This discussion is difficult enough without having you ridicule me.\" Colin shook his head. His voice was gentle when he spoke again. \"I wasn\u0027t mocking you,\" he said. \"I realize this is difficult for you. I hold my father responsible for both your discomfort and mine. He will not give up on trying to find a wife for me.\" \"He suggested I not say anything at all about marriage to you. He said you tend to develop a rash whenever that word is used in your presence. He wanted me to give you time to get to know me before he explained what he wanted. He thought… you might learn to like me.\" \"Look, I already like you,\" he said. \"But I\u0027m not in a position to marry anyone right now. In five years, according to my schedule, I\u0027ll be in a strong financial position and will be able to take a wife.\" \"Mother Superior would like you, Colin,\" Alesandra announced. \"She loves schedules. She believes life would be chaotic without them.\" \"How long did you live in this convent?\" he asked, anxious to turn the topic away from marriage. \"Quite a while,\" she answered. \"Colin, I\u0027m sorry, but I can\u0027t wait for you. I really must get married right away. It\u0027s unfortunate,\" she added with a sigh. \"I believe you would make an acceptable husband.\" \"And how would you know that?\" \"Your father told me so.\" He did laugh then. He couldn\u0027t help himself. Lord, she was an innocent. He noticed she was clutching the notecard in her hands then and immediately forced himself to stop. She was already embarrassed. His laughter was only adding to her discomfort. \"I\u0027ll talk to my father and save you that ordeal,\" he promised. \"I know he put these ideas into your head. He can be very convincing, can\u0027t he?\" She didn\u0027t answer him. She kept her gaze on her lap. Colin suddenly felt like a cad because he had disappointed her. Hell, he thought to himself. He wasn\u0027t making any sense. \"Alesandra, this bargain you made with my father surely involved a profit. How much was it?\" He let out a low whistle after she told him the exact amount. He leaned back against the mantel and shook his head. He was furious with his father now. \"Well, by God, you aren\u0027t going to be disappointed. If he promised you a near fortune, then he\u0027s going to pay. You kept your part of the bargain…\" She raised one hand for silence, unconsciously mimicking the mother superior\u0027s behavior. Colin obeyed without even realizing it. \"You misunderstand, sir. Your father didn\u0027t promise me anything. I promised him. He wouldn\u0027t accept my bargain, however, and was in fact appalled I even suggested paying for a husband.\" Colin laughed again. He was certain she was jesting with him. \"This isn\u0027t at all humorous, Colin. I must get married in three weeks\u0027 time, and your father is simply helping me. He\u0027s my guardian, after all.\" Colin needed to sit down. He walked over to the leather chair facing the settee and sprawled out. \"You\u0027re going to get married in three weeks?\" \"Yes,\" she replied. \"And that is why I asked your father\u0027s assistance.\" \"Alesandra…\" She waved the notecard in the air. \"I asked for assistance in preparing a list.\" \"A list of what?\" \"Suitable candidates.\" \"And?\" he prodded. \"He told me to marry you.\" Colin leaned forward, braced his elbows on his knees, and frowned at her. \"Listen carefully,\" he ordered. \"I\u0027m not marrying you.\" She immediately reached for the pen. She dipped it into the inkwell, then drew a line across the top of her notecard. \"What did you just do?\" \"I crossed you off.\" \"Off what?\" She looked exasperated. \"My list. Do you happen to know the Earl of Templeton?\" \"Yes.\" \"Is he a good man?\" \"Hell, no,\" he muttered. \"He\u0027s a rake. He used his sister\u0027s dowry to pay off a few of his gambling debts, but he still haunts the tables every night.\" Alesandra immediately dipped the pen into the inkwell again and scratched through the second name on her list. \"It\u0027s peculiar your father didn\u0027t know about the earl\u0027s gambling vice.\" \"Father doesn\u0027t go to the clubs anymore.\" \"That would explain it,\" she replied. \"Heavens, this is turning out to be more difficult than I anticipated.\" \"Alesandra, why are you in such a hurry to get married?\" Her pen was poised in the air. \"I beg your pardon?\" she asked, her concentration directed on her notecard. He repeated his question. \"You told me you had to get married in three weeks\u0027 time. I wondered why.\" \"The church,\" she explained with a quick nod. \"Colin, do you know the Marquess of Townsend perchance? Does he have any horrible vices?\" His patience was gone. \"Put the list down, Alesandra, and start answering my questions. What in God\u0027s name does the church have to do with…\" She interrupted him. \"Your mother already reserved it. She made all the other arrangements, too. She\u0027s the most wonderful lady, and heavens, she\u0027s so organized. It\u0027s going to be a beautiful wedding. I do hope you can attend. I\u0027ve decided against a large wedding, much to your parents\u0027 frustration, and settled instead on small and intimate.\" Colin wondered if his father realized his ward was out of her mind. \"Let me get this straight,\" he began. \"You\u0027ve taken care of all the arrangements without a man to…\" \"I can\u0027t take the credit,\" she interrupted. \"As I just explained, your mother did all the work.\" \"Aren\u0027t you approaching this from the wrong angle? It\u0027s usual to find a groom first, Alesandra.\" \"I agree with you, but this isn\u0027t a usual circumstance. I simply must get married right away.\" \"Why?\" \"Please don\u0027t think me rude, but since you\u0027ve decided against marrying me, I think it\u0027s best you not know anything more. I would still appreciate your help, however, if you\u0027re inclined to give it.\" Colin didn\u0027t have any intention of letting the matter drop. He would find out the real reason why she needed to get married, and he\u0027d find out before the day was over. He decided to use a little trickery now and ease back to his question later. \"I would be happy to assist you,\" he said. \"What is it you need?\" \"Would you please give me the names of five—no, make that six—suitable men? I\u0027ll interview them this week. By Monday next, I should have settled on someone.\" God, she was exasperating. \"What are your requirements?\" he inquired mildly. \"First, he must be honorable,\" she began. \"Second, he must be titled. My father would twist in his grave if I married a commoner.\" \"I\u0027m not titled,\" he reminded her. \"You were knighted. That qualifies.\" He laughed. \"You\u0027ve left out the most important requirement, haven\u0027t you? He\u0027ll have to be wealthy.\" She frowned at him. \"I believe you\u0027ve just insulted me,\" she announced. \"Still, you don\u0027t know me at all well and for that reason I\u0027ll forgive you your cynicism.\" \"Alesandra, most women looking for husbands want to live a comfortable life,\" he countered. \"Rich isn\u0027t important to me,\" she replied. \"You\u0027re as poor as a serf and I was willing to marry you, remember?\" He chafed over her bit of honesty. \"How would you know if I\u0027m rich or poor?\" \"Your father told me. Do you know, Colin, when you frown, you remind me of a dragon. I used to call Sister Mary Felicity a dragon, though I was too cowardly to say it to her face. Your frown is every bit as fierce, and I do believe the nickname is more appropriate for you.\" Colin refused to let her bait him. He wasn\u0027t going to let her switch topics either. \"What else do you require in a husband?\" \"He\u0027ll have to leave me alone,\" she replied after a moment\u0027s consideration. \"I don\u0027t want a man who… hovers.\" He laughed again. He immediately regretted that action when he saw her expression. Hell, he\u0027d hurt her feelings. Her eyes got all teary, too. \"I don\u0027t particularly want a wife who would hover either,\" he admitted, thinking his agreement would ease her hurt. She wouldn\u0027t look at him. \"Would a rich woman appeal to you?\" she asked. \"No,\" he answered. \"I determined a long time ago to make my own fortune without any outside help, and I mean to keep that promise to myself. My brother has offered to lend my partner and me funds and of course my father has also offered to help.\" \"But you refused them,\" she countered. \"Your father believes you\u0027re too independent.\" Colin decided to change the subject. \"Will your husband share your bed?\" She refused to answer him. She lifted her pen again. \"Begin your list, please.\" \"No.\" \"But you said you would help me.\" \"That was before I realized you were out of your mind.\" She put the pen back on the table and stood up. \"Please excuse me.\" \"Where are you going?\" \"To pack.\" He chased her to the door. He took hold of her arm and turned her around to face him. Damn, he really had upset her. He hated to see the tears in her eyes, especially since he knew he was the cause of her distress. \"You\u0027re going to stay here until I decide what to do with you,\" he said, his voice gruff. \"I decide my future, Colin, not you. Let go of me. I won\u0027t stay where I\u0027m not wanted.\" \"You\u0027re staying here.\" He added a glare to his order so she would back down. It didn\u0027t work. She wouldn\u0027t be intimidated. In truth, she glared back. \"You don\u0027t want me, remember?\" she challenged. He smiled. \"Oh, I want you all right. I\u0027m just not willing to marry you. I\u0027m being completely honest with you and I can see from your blush I\u0027ve embarrassed you. You\u0027re too damn young and innocent for this ridiculous game you\u0027ve taken on. Let my father…\" \"Your father is too ill to help me,\" she interrupted. She jerked her arm away from his hold. \"But there are others who will come to my aid. You needn\u0027t be concerned.\" He couldn\u0027t explain why he felt insulted, but he did. \"Since my father is too ill to see to his duty of looking out for you, the task falls on my shoulders.\" \"No, it doesn\u0027t,\" she argued. \"Your brother, Caine, will act as my guardian. He\u0027s next in line.\" \"But Caine\u0027s conveniently ill too, isn\u0027t he?\" \"I don\u0027t believe there is anything convenient about his illness, Colin.\" He didn\u0027t argue the point with her, and in fact pretended he hadn\u0027t heard her. \"And as your guardian during this period of family illness, I will decide where you go and when. Don\u0027t give me that defiant look, young lady,\" he ordered. \"I always get my way. By nightfall I\u0027ll know why you think you have to get married so quickly.\" She shook her head. He grabbed hold of her chin and held her steady. \"God, but you\u0027re stubborn.\" He tweaked her nose, then let go of her. \"I\u0027ll be back in a few hours. Stay put, Alesandra. If you leave, I\u0027ll come after you.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/castles-crown-s-spies-4/page-5.html","bookId":1789,"book":{"id":1789,"title":"Castles (Crown\u0027s Spies #4)","description":"Storyline: Orphaned and besieged Princess Alesandra knew that only hasty marriage to an Englishman could protect her from the turmoil in her own land.
