{"id":78318,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"The kiss wasn\u0027t at all gentle. But, Lord, it was hot. Alesandra didn\u0027t know if she struggled or not. She was having trouble thinking at all. Colin\u0027s mouth was so wonderfully thorough, she never wanted him to stop. Alesandra had never been kissed before and had therefore never experienced passion. She was overwhelmed by it now. Colin was certainly experienced, though. His mouth slanted over hers again and again while his tongue rubbed against hers in intimate love play. Colin realized he should stop when he heard her sexy little whimper. He growled low in his throat and kissed her again. Damn, he wanted her. His hand brushed against the swell of her breast and the heat and fullness he felt under his hand through the material of her gown made him ache to make love to her. He forced himself to pull away from her. Alesandra collapsed against him. She didn\u0027t realize she had her arms around his waist until he told her to let go. She was so confused by what had just happened to her, she didn\u0027t know what to say or do. She tried to back away from him, but she was trembling so much she could barely get her legs to support her. He knew he\u0027d rattled her. The grin on his face was extremely telling—arrogant, too. \"That was my first kiss,\" she stammered out as an excuse for her sorry condition. Colin couldn\u0027t resist. He pulled her back into his arms and kissed her again. \"And that was your second,\" he whispered. \"Begging your pardon,\" Jenkins called out from the doorway. \"The duchess is most insistent you join her in the dining room.\" Alesandra jerked away from Colin. She acted as though she\u0027d just been scorched by the sun. Her cheeks turned pink with embarrassment. She peeked around Colin to look at the butler. He smiled at her. \"We\u0027re coming, Jenkins,\" Colin called out. He kept his gaze on Alesandra, smiling over her embarrassment. She tried to skirt her way around him. He took hold of her hand and wouldn\u0027t let go. \"I\u0027ll make the announcement during dinner,\" he told her as he pulled her through the doorway. \"No,\" she countered. \"Colin, your kisses haven\u0027t changed anything. I\u0027m not going to marry you and ruin all your carefully laid plans.\" \"Alesandra, I always win. Understand me?\" She let out an unladylike snort. He squeezed her hand and started down the steps. She had to run to keep up with him. \"I dislike arrogant, think-they\u0027re-always-right men,\" she muttered. \"I do too,\" he agreed. \"I was referring to you.\" Lord, she felt like screaming. \"I\u0027m not marrying you.\" \"We\u0027ll see.\" He wasn\u0027t going to give up. The man was sinfully stubborn. But then so was she, she reminded herself. Her guardian had given her his word she could choose her own husband and Colin\u0027s intimidating tactics didn\u0027t matter. Dinner was a nerve-racking affair. Alesandra\u0027s stomach was tied in knots and she could barely swallow anything. She should have been hungry, but she wasn\u0027t. She kept waiting for Colin to say something, and was praying at the same time that he wouldn\u0027t open his mouth. Jade drew her into conversation. \"I understand the prince regent called on you,\" she remarked. \"Yes,\" Alesandra answered. \"I wouldn\u0027t have allowed him entrance into Colin\u0027s home if I\u0027d known he\u0027d cheated Colin\u0027s partner out of an inheritance, however.\" Jade smiled. \"His partner is my brother,\" she said. She turned to the duchess to explain what they\u0027d been talking about. \"The prince regent was holding my brother\u0027s wife\u0027s inheritance while the fighting was going on between the families, but once it was all resolved, he decided to keep the gift for himself. It was a sizable sum.\" \"You really wouldn\u0027t have let the prince regent in?\" Caine asked. \"No, I wouldn\u0027t have,\" Alesandra said again. \"Why do you look so surprised? Colin\u0027s home is his castle. Only friends should be allowed inside.\" Alesandra turned her attention to Jade and therefore missed the grin the two brothers shared. \"Do you happen to know a lady named Victoria Perry?\" she asked. Jade shook her head. \"The name isn\u0027t familiar to me. Why do you ask?\" \"I\u0027m worried about her,\" Alesandra confessed. She explained how she\u0027d met Victoria and what she had learned since she\u0027d last received a letter from her. \"My dear, I don\u0027t believe it\u0027s a good idea to pursue this further,\" the duchess announced. \"Her mother must be heartbroken. It\u0027s cruel to dredge it all up again.\" \"Colin said the very same thing to me,\" Alesandra said. \"Perhaps you are right. I should let the matter rest. I wish I could quit worrying about her.\" The duchess turned the conversation then to the topic of her eldest daughter. This was Catherine\u0027s year for coming out and she was full of plans for her first ball. Caine didn\u0027t say a word throughout the rest of the meal. He kept his gaze on his brother. Colin wasn\u0027t giving anything away. His expression could have been carved in stone. Alesandra actually began to relax a little when dessert was served and Colin still hadn\u0027t brought up the topic of marriage. She thought he\u0027d probably had enough time to think the matter through. Yes, he\u0027d come to his senses. \"Have you had time to talk to Alesandra, son?\" the Duke of Williamshire asked. \"Yes,\" Colin replied. \"We\u0027ve decided…\" \"Not to marry,\" she blurted out. \"What\u0027s this? Colin, I thought it had all been decided,\" his father protested. \"It has been decided,\" Colin agreed. He reached over and covered Alesandra\u0027s hand with his. \"We\u0027re getting married. Alesandra has agreed to become my wife.\" She started shaking her head in denial but no one seemed to be paying any attention to her. \"Congratulations,\" her guardian announced. \"Gweneth, this calls for a toast.\" \"Don\u0027t you think Alesandra should agree first?\" Jade asked just as her father-in-law started to stand up with his water glass in hand. He sat back down. \"Yes, of course,\" he replied. \"She\u0027ll marry me,\" Colin said, his voice hard, unbending. She turned to him. \"I won\u0027t let you make this noble sacrifice. You don\u0027t want to get married for another five years, remember? What about your schedule?\" She didn\u0027t wait for Colin to answer her question but turned her attention back to Uncle Henry. \"I don\u0027t want to marry him, Uncle, and you did promise me I could choose.\" Her guardian slowly nodded. \"I did agree to let you select your husband. Was there a specific reason why you refused Colin?\" \"He won\u0027t agree to a financial arrangement,\" she explained. \"He wants other benefits.\" \"Benefits?\" Caine asked, his curiosity pricked. \"Such as?\" She started blushing. She looked at Colin, hoping he\u0027d explain. He shook his head at her. \"You started this, you finish it,\" he ordered. The sparkle in his eyes indicated his amusement. She straightened her shoulders. \"Very well,\" she announced. She couldn\u0027t quite look at Caine when she gave him her answer, however, and stared at the wall behind him. \"Colin would demand… intimacy.\" No one knew what to say to that confession. Her guardian looked thoroughly confused. He started to open his mouth to say something, then changed his mind. \"Aren\u0027t most marriages intimate?\" Caine asked. \"You are referring to the marriage bed, aren\u0027t you, Alesandra?\" \"Yes.\" \"And?\" he prodded. \"My marriage will not be intimate,\" she announced, her voice emphatic. She tried to change the subject by adding, \"Colin didn\u0027t want to marry me until after he\u0027d talked to his father. Now he\u0027s feeling honor bound. Clearly, he\u0027s marrying me out of duty.\" Her guardian let out a sigh. \"I did give you my word,\" he admitted. \"If you don\u0027t want to marry Colin, I won\u0027t force you.\" The duchess was fanning herself with her napkin. \"Jade, dear, I believe you should be the one to have a private talk with Alesandra. You\u0027re younger and not as set in your ways as I am, and it should be a woman to discuss this topic I have in mind. Alesandra seems to harbor some fears about the… marriage bed… and I don\u0027t feel qualified to explain… that is…\" She couldn\u0027t finish her request. The duchess was violently fanning herself now and her face looked like it was on fire. \"Mother, you\u0027ve had children. I believe that makes you very qualified,\" Colin told her. Jade poked her husband in his side in a bid to get him to quit laughing. \"I believe Morgan Atkins will be suitable,\" Alesandra blurted out. \"If he needs my inheritance, he\u0027ll agree to my terms, and I don\u0027t mind bowlegged children. No, I don\u0027t mind at all.\" \"If you aren\u0027t going to be intimate with your husband, how the hell are you going to have children?\" Colin asked. \"I was thinking into the future,\" Alesandra stammered. She realized the contradictions in her argument but couldn\u0027t seem to think of a way to straighten it all out. Why would she want to be intimate with a man she didn\u0027t know? The very thought made her stomach twist. \"Jade, I believe you should have that talk with Alesandra directly after dinner,\" the duchess interjected. \"Yes, Mother,\" Jade agreed. \"Has anyone ever discussed the facts of marriage to you?\" Caine asked. Alesandra\u0027s blush was hot enough to scorch the tablecloth. \"Yes, of course. Mother Superior told me everything I need to know. Could we please change this topic now?\" Her guardian took mercy on her. \"So it\u0027s Morgan you\u0027ve chosen?\" he asked. He waited for her nod, then continued. \"Very well. We\u0027ll invite him over for supper and take his measure.\" \"I\u0027ll want to talk to him too,\" Colin announced. \"He\u0027ll need to know, of course.\" \"Know what?\" his father inquired. Caine was already grinning. He knew his brother was up to something, but he couldn\u0027t imagine what it was. Only one thing was certain in Caine\u0027s mind. Colin had made the decision to marry Alesandra, and he wasn\u0027t going to let her get away now. \"Yes, son,\" his mother said. \"What is it Morgan needs to know?\" \"That Alesandra and I slept together.\" The duchess dropped her napkin and let out a little screech. Jade\u0027s mouth dropped open. Caine started laughing. The Duke of Williamshire had just taken a swallow of water when Colin made his announcement. He started choking. Alesandra closed her eyes and fought the urge to scream. \"You slept with her?\" his father demanded in a strangled roar. \"Yes, sir,\" Colin answered. His voice was very pleasant, cheerful in fact. He seemed completely unaffected by his father\u0027s wrath. \"Several times in fact.\" \"How could you deliberately…\" Alesandra couldn\u0027t go on. She was so mortified, she couldn\u0027t seem to catch a thought long enough to speak it. \"How could I lie?\" Colin asked her. \"You know better. I never lie. We did sleep together, didn\u0027t we?\" Everyone was staring at her now, waiting for her denial. \"Yes,\" she whispered. \"But we…\" \"For the love of God,\" her guardian shouted. \"Henry, calm yourself. You\u0027re going to make yourself ill,\" his wife advised when she saw how mottled his complexion was becoming. The duchess was once again frantically fanning herself with her napkin in an effort to remain composed. Colin leaned back in his chair and let the sparks fly around him. He looked bored. Caine was thoroughly enjoying himself. Jade kept trying to make her husband take the matter more seriously by poking him in his ribs. \"Colin, have you nothing to say to straighten out this misconception?\" Alesandra demanded in a near shout so she would be heard above Caine\u0027s laughter. \"Yes,\" Colin answered. She sagged with relief and gratitude. The feeling was short-lived, however. \"If Morgan still wants you after I\u0027ve explained how we spent the last week, he\u0027s a better man than I am.\" \"You don\u0027t have to tell him anything.\" Alesandra tried to control the anger in her voice. She didn\u0027t want to lose her dignity, but, Lord, Colin was making that difficult. Her composure was in shreds and her throat was aching with the need to shout. \"Oh, but I do have to explain the situation to Morgan,\" Colin said. \"It\u0027s the only honorable thing to do. Isn\u0027t that right, Caine?\" \"Absolutely right,\" Caine agreed. \"It\u0027s the only honorable thing to do.\" Caine turned to his wife then. \"Sweetheart, I don\u0027t believe you\u0027ll need to have that private talk about the marriage bed with Alesandra after all.\" Alesandra glared at Caine for that comment, because she could tell from his grin he was jesting. \"Dear God, what must Nathaniel be thinking? He\u0027s looking down from heaven and probably shaking his head in regret for leaving his daughter in my hands.\" \"Uncle Henry, my father wouldn\u0027t have any regrets,\" Alesandra announced. She was so furious with Colin for getting his own papa upset her voice crackled with tension. \"Nothing sinful happened. I did go into his room and I did sleep with him, but only because he was so demanding and I became so weary…\" The Duke of Williamshire covered his forehead with his hands and let out a low groan. Alesandra knew she was making a mess out of her explanation and tried to start over. \"I kept my clothes on,\" she blurted out. \"And he…\" She was going to explain that Colin had been ill and had needed her help, but she was interrupted before she could finish. \"I wasn\u0027t wearing anything,\" Colin cheerfully informed his family. \"That\u0027s it,\" his father bellowed. His fist came down hard on the tabletop. The crystal goblets clattered together in reaction. Alesandra jumped, then turned to glare at Colin. She\u0027d never been this angry in all her life. Colin had deliberately twisted the truth to his advantage and now her guardian thought she was a trollop. She decided she wasn\u0027t going to sit there another second. She threw her napkin on the table and tried to leave. Colin caught her before she\u0027d even pushed her chair back. He put his arm around her shoulders and hauled her into his side. \"You two are going to be married in exactly three days\u0027 time. Caine, you see to the special license. Colin, you keep silent about what happened. I won\u0027t have Alesandra\u0027s reputation in tatters because of your lust.\" \"Three days, Henry?\" Gweneth asked. \"The church is reserved for the Saturday after next. Couldn\u0027t you reconsider?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/castles-crown-s-spies-4/page-18.html","bookId":1789,"book":{"id":1789,"title":"Castles (Crown\u0027s Spies #4)","description":"Storyline: Orphaned and besieged Princess Alesandra knew that only hasty marriage to an Englishman could protect her from the turmoil in her own land.
