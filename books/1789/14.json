All married women were unhappy creatures. The bitches all felt neglected by their husbands. They whined and complained, and nothing ever pleased them. Oh, he\u0027d watched, he\u0027d observed. The husbands usually ignored their wives, too, but he didn\u0027t fault them. Everyone knew mistresses were reserved for affection and attention; wives were simply necessary leeches to be used for the reproduction of heirs. One put up with a wife when one had to, rutted with her as often as necessary until she was carrying one\u0027s child, and then forgot about her. He had deliberately ignored married women because he believed the hunt wouldn\u0027t amount to much. There wouldn\u0027t be any satisfaction gained in chasing a dog who wouldn\u0027t run. Still, this one intrigued him. She looked so miserable. He\u0027d watched her for over an hour now. She was clinging to her husband\u0027s arm, and trying every now and then to say or do something to draw his attention. It was wasted effort. The gallant husband was thoroughly occupied talking to his friends from the clubs. He wasn\u0027t giving his pretty little wife any attention. The poor little chit. It was obvious to anyone watching she loved the man. She was pitifully unhappy. He was about to change all that. He smiled then, his mind made up. The hunt was on again. Soon, very soon, he would put his new pet out of her misery. Chapter 6 Colin stayed in conference with Sir Richards and Morgan for several hours. Alesandra ate her supper alone in the dining room. She stayed downstairs as long as she could manage without falling asleep, hoping Colin would join her. She wanted to thank him for showing such an interest in her future and ask him a few questions about the Earl of Oakmount. She gave up the wait around midnight and went up to bed. Valena knocked on her door fifteen minutes later. \"You are requested to be ready to go out tomorrow morning, Princess. You must be ready to leave at ten o\u0027clock.\" Alesandra got into her bed and pulled the covers up. \"Did Colin explain where we\u0027re going?\" The lady\u0027s maid nodded. \"To Sir Richards\u0027s home,\" she answered. \"On Bowers Street at number twelve.\" Alesandra smiled. \"He gave you the address?\" \"Yes, Princess. He was very thorough in his instructions to me. He wanted me to tell you he doesn\u0027t wish to be kept waiting,\" she said with a frown. \"There was something more he wanted me to… oh, yes, now I remember. The meeting scheduled for the afternoon with the Duke and Duchess of Williamshire has been canceled.\" \"Did Colin tell you why it was canceled?\" \"No, Princess, he didn\u0027t.\" Valena let out a dramatic yawn and immediately begged her mistress\u0027s pardon. \"I\u0027m very weary tonight,\" she whispered. \"Of course you\u0027re weary,\" Alesandra said. \"It\u0027s quite late and you\u0027ve put in a full day\u0027s work, Valena. Go to bed now. Sleep well,\" she called out when the maid went hurrying out the doorway. Alesandra fell asleep a few minutes later. She was so exhausted from the long week of taking care of Colin, she slept the night through. She awakened a little after eight the next morning and hurried to get ready. She wore a pale pink walking dress. Colin would approve of the garment for the square-cut neckline was very prim and proper. Alesandra was downstairs a good twenty minutes before they were scheduled to leave. Colin didn\u0027t join her until a few minutes after ten. As soon as she spotted him coming down the stairs, she called out to him. \"We\u0027re already late, Colin. Do hurry.\" \"There\u0027s been a change in plans, Alesandra,\" Colin explained. He winked at her when he passed her on his way into the dining room. She chased after him. \"What change in plans?\" \"The meeting\u0027s been canceled.\" \"The meeting with Sir Richards or the meeting this afternoon? Valena said…\" Colin pulled the chair out and motioned for her to sit down at the dining room table. \"Both meetings were canceled,\" he said. \"Would you care for chocolate or hot tea, Princess?\" Flannaghan called out from the entrance. \"Tea, thank you. Colin, how did you find out the meeting was canceled? I\u0027ve been waiting in the foyer and no messenger came to the door.\" Colin didn\u0027t answer her. He sat down, picked up the newspaper, and started reading. Flannaghan appeared at his side with a basket of biscuits, which he placed in front of him. Alesandra was both irritated and confused. \"Exactly why did Sir Richards want a meeting? We both spoke to him last evening.\" \"Eat your breakfast, Alesandra.\" \"You aren\u0027t going to explain, are you?\" \"No.\" \"Colin, it\u0027s impolite to be rude first thing in the morning.\" He lowered the paper to grin at her. She realized then her statement had been foolish. \"I mean to say, it\u0027s always impolite to be rude.\" He disappeared behind his paper again. She drummed her fingertips on the tabletop. Raymond walked into the dining room then. Alesandra immediately motioned him to her side. \"Did a messenger…\" Colin interrupted her. \"Alesandra, are you challenging my word?\" \"No,\" she answered. \"I\u0027m just trying to understand. Will you quit hiding behind that paper?\" \"Are you always in such a foul mood in the morning?\" Alesandra gave up trying to have a decent conversation with the man. She ate half a biscuit and then excused herself from the table. Raymond gave her a sympathetic look when she walked past him. Alesandra went back upstairs and worked on her correspondence the rest of the morning. She wrote a long letter to the mother superior, telling her all about her journey to England. She described her guardian and his family, and spent three full pages explaining how she had ended up living with Colin. She was sealing the envelope closed when Stefan knocked on the door. \"You\u0027re wanted downstairs, Princess Alesandra.\" \"Do we have company, Stefan?\" The guard shook his head, \"We\u0027re going out. You\u0027ll need your cloak. The wind\u0027s up today.\" \"Where are we going?\" \"To a meeting, Princess.\" \"On again, off again, on again,\" she remarked. \"Begging your pardon, Princess?\" Alesandra closed the lid to the inkwell, straightened the desk, and then stood up. \"I was just complaining to myself,\" she admitted with a smile. \"Is this meeting with Colin\u0027s father or with Sir Richards?\" \"I\u0027m not certain,\" Stefan admitted. \"But Colin\u0027s waiting in the foyer and he seems impatient to get going.\" Alesandra promised the guard she would be right down. Stefan bowed to her and then left the room. She hurried to brush her hair, then went to the wardrobe to fetch her cloak. She was walking out the doorway when she remembered her list. If they were going to the Duke of Williamshire\u0027s town house, she would certainly need the notecard, she decided, so that she could go over the names with her guardian and his wife. She hurried back over to the desk to get the list and tucked it into the pocket of her cloak. Colin was waiting in the foyer. She paused at the landing to put her cloak over her arm. \"Colin? Are we going to see your father or Sir Richards?\" He didn\u0027t answer her. She hurried down the steps and then repeated her question. \"We\u0027re going to see Sir Richards,\" he explained. \"Why does he want to see us again so soon? He was just here last evening,\" she reminded him. \"He has his reasons.\" Valena was standing with Stefan and Raymond near the entrance to the salon. She hurried forward to assist her mistress with her cloak. Colin beat her to the task. He put the cloak around Alesandra\u0027s shoulders, took hold of her hand, and then walked outside, dragging her behind him. She had to run to keep up with his long-legged stride. Raymond and Stefan followed behind. The two guards climbed up the rack to sit with the driver. Colin and Alesandra sat across from each other inside the carriage. He locked the doors, then leaned back against the cushions and smiled at her. \"Why are you frowning?\" he asked. \"Why are you acting so peculiar?\" \"I don\u0027t like surprises.\" \"Do you see? That was a peculiar answer.\" Colin stretched out his long legs. She adjusted her skirts and moved closer to the corner to give him more room. \"Do you know what Sir Richards wants to talk to us about?\" she asked. \"We aren\u0027t going to see him,\" Colin explained. \"But you said…\" \"I lied.\" Her gasp made him smile. \"You lied to me?\" She looked incredulous. He slowly nodded. \"Yes, I lied to you.\" \"Why?\" Her outrage made him want to laugh. She was such a delight when she was riled. And, Lord, she was certainly riled now. Her cheeks were flushed with a blush, and if her shoulders got any straighter, he thought, her spine might snap. \"I\u0027ll explain later,\" he told her. \"Quit your frown, brat. It\u0027s too fine a day to get upset.\" She finally noticed how cheerful he was. \"Why are you so happy?\" He shrugged his answer. She let out a sigh. The man was deliberately trying to confuse her, she decided. \"Exactly where are we going, Colin?\" \"To a meeting with the family to decide what to do…\" She finished his explanation for him. \"With me?\" He nodded. Alesandra lowered her gaze to her lap, but not before Colin saw her expression. She looked crushed. Her feelings had been hurt, he knew, but he didn\u0027t know what he\u0027d said to cause that reaction. His voice was gruff when he said, \"Now what\u0027s the matter with you?\" \"Nothing\u0027s the matter.\" \"Don\u0027t lie to me.\" \"You lied to me.\" \"I said I\u0027d explain later,\" he countered. He tried to keep the irritation out of his voice when he added, \"Now explain why you\u0027re looking ready to weep.\" \"I\u0027ll explain later.\" Colin leaned forward. He grabbed hold of her chin and forced her to look at him. \"Don\u0027t turn my words back on me,\" he ordered. She pushed his hand away. \"Very well,\" she announced. \"I was a little upset when I realized why you\u0027re so happy.\" \"Make sense, damn it.\" The carriage came to a stop in front of the Duke of Williamshire\u0027s town house. Colin unlatched the door but kept his gaze on her. \"Well?\" he demanded. She adjusted her cloak around her shoulders. \"It makes perfect sense to me,\" she told him with a nod. Raymond opened the door and held his hand out to assist her. She immediately stepped outside, then turned to frown at Colin. \"You\u0027re happy because you\u0027re finally getting rid of me.\" He opened his mouth to argue with her. She raised her hand in an unspoken command to keep silent. \"You needn\u0027t worry, sir. I\u0027m over my upset. Shall we go inside now?\" She was trying to be dignified. Colin wouldn\u0027t let her. He started laughing. She turned and hurried up the steps. Raymond and Stefan flanked her sides. \"You still look upset, brat.\" The door was opened by the butler just as she whirled around to tell Colin what she thought of that rude remark. \"If you call me a brat again, I swear I\u0027ll do something most undignified. I am not upset,\" she added in a voice that mocked that lie. \"I just thought you and I had become friends. Yes, I did. You were becoming like a cousin to me and I…\" Colin leaned down until he was just an inch or so from her face. \"I\u0027m not your cousin,\" he snapped. Colin\u0027s brother, Caine, took over the butler\u0027s duty and stood in the doorway, waiting for someone to notice him. He could only see the back of Princess Alesandra. She was a little thing and, he judged, quite courageous. Colin was towering over her, giving her his best glare, but she wasn\u0027t cowering away. She didn\u0027t seem to be at all intimidated. \"Everyone believes we\u0027re cousins,\" she snapped. \"I don\u0027t give a damn what everyone else thinks.\" She took a deep breath. \"This conversation is ridiculous. If you don\u0027t wish to be related to me, that\u0027s just fine.\" \"I\u0027m not related to you.\" \"You don\u0027t have to shout, Colin.\" \"You\u0027re making me crazed, Alesandra.\" \"Good afternoon.\" Caine fairly bellowed his greeting so he\u0027d be heard. Alesandra was so startled by the interruption, she grabbed hold of Colin. She was quick to recover. She pushed herself out of his arms and turned around. She tried to force a serene, dignified expression. The incredibly handsome man standing in the doorway had to be Colin\u0027s brother. Their smiles were almost identical. Caine\u0027s hair was a bit lighter in shade, however, and his eyes were an altogether different color. They were gray, and in her estimation not nearly as attractive as Colin\u0027s more-green-than-hazel color. Alesandra tried to curtsy. Colin wouldn\u0027t let her. He grabbed hold of her arm and nudged her through the opening. She pinched him to make him let go of her. A tug of war resulted when Colin tried to take her cloak. She kept slapping his hand away so she could retrieve her notecard from the pocket of the garment. Caine stood behind his brother. His hands were clasped behind his back and he was desperately trying not to laugh. He hadn\u0027t seen his brother this rattled in a good long while. Alesandra finally pulled the notecard free. \"Now you may take my cloak, thank you.\" Colin rolled his eyes heavenward. He tossed her cloak in Caine\u0027s direction. His brother caught the garment in midair just as Colin spotted the notecard clutched in Alesandra\u0027s hand. \"Why in God\u0027s name did you bring that thing along?\" \"I\u0027m going to need it,\" she explained. \"I simply don\u0027t understand your aversion to this list, Colin. Your hostility is most unreasonable.\" She turned her attention to his brother. \"You\u0027ll have to excuse your brother\u0027s rudeness. He\u0027s been ill.\" Caine smiled. Colin shook his head. \"You don\u0027t have to make excuses for me,\" he stated. \"Caine, this is the woman you\u0027ve been referring to as The Plague. Alesandra, meet my brother.\" She again tried to curtsy and Colin again ruined it. She was just leaning forward to catch hold of her gown when Colin grabbed hold of her hand and started dragging her into the salon.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/castles-crown-s-spies-4/page-14.html","bookId":1789,"book":{"id":1789,"title":"Castles (Crown\u0027s Spies #4)","description":"Storyline: Orphaned and besieged Princess Alesandra knew that only hasty marriage to an Englishman could protect her from the turmoil in her own land.
