He held his frown. \"Yes.\"\n \"Then why didn\u0027t you try to reason why you were limping?\"\n He lifted his shoulders in a shrug. \"A shark took a bite out of my leg. Call me daft, Alesandra, but I assumed that was the reason I limped.\"\n She shook her head. \"That was the reason for the injury,\" she explained. \"I looked at the bottoms of your shoes. The left heel was barely worn on each pair. Then, of course, I knew what to do.\" She let out a sigh. \"I do wish you weren\u0027t so sensitive about this issue.\"\n She turned to look at Caine. \"He is sensitive, though. Have you, by chance, noticed?\"\n Caine nodded.\n She smiled because she\u0027d gained his agreement. \"He won\u0027t even talk about it.\"\n \"He\u0027s talking about it now,\" Caine told her.\n She whirled around to look at her husband. \"You are talking about it,\" she cried out.\n She looked thrilled. Colin didn\u0027t know what to make of that. \"Yes,\" he agreed.\n \"Then will you let me sleep in your bed every night?\"\n Caine laughed. Alesandra ignored him. \"I know why you go back to your room. It\u0027s because your leg hurts and you need to walk. I\u0027m right, aren\u0027t I, Colin?\"\n He didn\u0027t answer her.\n \"Will you please say something?\"\n \"Thank you.\"\n She was thoroughly confused. \"Why are you thanking me?\"\n \"For the insert.\"\n \"You aren\u0027t angry?\"\n \"No.\"\n She was astonished by his attitude.\n He was humbled by her thoughtfulness.\n They stared at each other a long minute.\n \"You aren\u0027t angry with Flannaghan, are you?\" she asked.\n \"No.\"\n \"Why aren\u0027t you angry with me?\"\n \"Because you had my best interests at heart.\"\n \"What a nice thing to say.\"\n Colin laughed. She smiled. Flannaghan came running into the study and thrust a glass of water at Caine. His attention was centered on Alesandra. She saw his worried expression and whispered, \"He isn\u0027t angry.\"\n Caine drew her attention when he announced he was going home. Colin didn\u0027t take his gaze off his wife when he bid his brother good night.\n \"Alesandra, stay here. Flannaghan will see Caine out.\"\n \"As you wish, husband.\"\n \"God, I love it when you\u0027re humble.\"\n \"Why?\"\n \"It\u0027s so damned rare.\"\n She shrugged. He laughed again. \"Is there something else you wanted to tell me?\" he asked.\n Her shoulders slumped. The man was too cunning by half. \"Oh, all right,\" she muttered. \"I talked to Sir Winters about your leg to gain suggestions. We spoke in confidence, of course.\"\n Colin raised an eyebrow. \"Suggestions for what?\"\n \"For ways to make it feel better. I made a list of his ideas. Would you like me to fetch it for you?\"\n \"Later,\" he answered. \"Now, then, is there something else you wanted to tell me?\"\n The question covered a broad range of topics. Colin decided he\u0027d have to remember to ask her that question every other week in future so that he could find out what she\u0027d been up to.\n She wasn\u0027t about to blurt out another confession until she knew what he was fishing for. \"Could you be more specific please?\"\n Her question told him there were still more secrets. \"No,\" he answered. \"You know what I\u0027m asking. Tell me.\"\n She threaded her fingers through her hair and walked over to the side of his desk. \"Dreyson told you, didn\u0027t he?\"\n He shook his head. \"Then how did you find out?\"\n \"I\u0027ll explain how I found out after you tell me,\" he promised.\n \"You already know,\" she countered. \"You just want to make me feel guilty, don\u0027t you? Well, it won\u0027t wash. I didn\u0027t cancel the order for the steam vessel and it\u0027s too late for you to interfere. Besides, you told me I could do whatever I wanted with my inheritance. I ordered the ship for myself. Yes, I did. I\u0027ve always wanted one. If, however, you and Nathan would like to use my ship every now and again, I would be happy to share it with you.\"\n \"I told Dreyson to cancel the order,\" he reminded her.\n \"I told him Albert had decided he wanted it.\"\n \"What the hell else have you kept from me?\"\n \"You didn\u0027t know?\"\n \"Alesandra…\"\n \"You\u0027re pricking my temper, Colin. You still don\u0027t understand how much you hurt me,\" she announced. \"Can you imagine how I felt when I heard Nathan say that he and you were all set to use Sara\u0027s inheritance to build the company? You made such an issue out of turning your back on my inheritance.\"\n Colin pulled her onto his lap. She immediately put her arms around his neck and smiled at him.\n He frowned at her. \"The money was put aside by the king for both Nathan and Sara,\" he explained.\n \"My father put his money away for me and my husband.\"\n She had him there, he thought to himself. She knew it, too. \"Your father wonders why he\u0027s still in charge of my funds, Colin. It\u0027s embarrassing. You should take over the task. I would help.\"\n His smile was filled with tenderness. \"How about if I helped you manage it?\"\n \"That would be nice.\" She leaned against him. \"I love you, Colin.\"\n \"I love you, too. Sweetheart, isn\u0027t there something else you want to tell me?\"\n She didn\u0027t answer him. Colin reached into his pocket and pulled out her list. She snuggled closer to him.\n He opened the paper. \"I want you to be able to talk to me about anything,\" he explained. \"From this moment on.\"\n She started to pull away from him but he tightened his hold on her. \"I made it impossible for you to talk about my leg, didn\u0027t I?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry about that, sweetheart. Now stay still while I answer your questions for you, all right?\"\n \"I don\u0027t have any questions?\"\n \"Hush, love,\" he ordered. He held her close with one hand and lifted the sheet of paper with the other. He silently read her first order and then said, \"I have listened to your concerns about Victoria, haven\u0027t I?\"\n \"Yes, but why…\"\n Colin squeezed her. \"Be patient,\" he commanded. He read the second order. \"I will promise to soften in my attitude toward your inheritance.\" In brackets Alesandra had written the word stubborn. He let out a sigh. \"And I won\u0027t be mule-headed about it.\"\n The third order made him smile. She had instructed him not to wait five years to realize he loved her.\n Since he\u0027d already complied with that command, he moved on to the next order. He should try to be happy he was going to become a father and he shouldn\u0027t blame her because she was interfering with his schedule.\n Could pregnant wives become nuns? Colin decided to answer the last first.\n \"Alesandra?\"\n \"Yes?\"\n He kissed the top of her head. \"No,\" he whispered.\n The laughter in his voice confused her. So did his denial. \"No, what, husband?\"\n \"Pregnant wives can\u0027t become nuns.\"\n She would have jumped off his lap if he\u0027d let her. He held her tight against him until she finally calmed down.\n She did a lot of ranting and raving, too. \"You knew… all the time… Oh, God, it was the list. You found it and that\u0027s why you told me you loved me.\"\n Colin forced her chin up and kissed her hard. \"I knew I loved you before I read your list,\" he told her. \"You\u0027re going to have to trust me, Alesandra. Trust your heart, too.\"\n \"But…\"\n His mouth silenced her protest. When he pulled back, she had tears in her eyes. \"I\u0027m going to ask you one last time,\" he said. \"Do you have something to tell me?\"\n She slowly nodded. He looked so arrogantly pleased. Dear God, how she loved him. From the way he was looking at her, she knew he loved her just as much.\n Oh, yes, he was happy about the baby. She didn\u0027t have any worries about that. His hand had dropped to her stomach and he was gently patting her. She didn\u0027t think he was even aware of what he was doing. The action was telling, though. He was caressing his unborn son or daughter.\n \"Answer me,\" he commanded in a rough whisper.\n He was looking so fiercely intent now. She smiled in reaction. Colin always tried to be so serious, so disciplined. She loved that trait in him, of course, but she found she delighted in making him forget himself every now and again.\n She did love to tease him and all because he reacted with such surprise.\n Colin couldn\u0027t hold on to his patience any longer. \"Answer me, Alesandra.\"\n \"Yes, Colin. I do have something to tell you. I\u0027ve decided to become a nun.\"\n He looked like he wanted to throttle her. His glare made her laugh. She wrapped her arms around him again and tucked her head under his chin.\n \"We\u0027re going to have a baby,\" she whispered. \"Have I mentioned that yet?\"\n Chapter 14\n An endless stream of visitors demanded Colin\u0027s attention during the following two weeks. Sir Richards was there so often he might as well have had his own bedroom. Caine stopped by every afternoon, and so did Nathan. Alesandra didn\u0027t see much of her husband during the daylight hours, but the evenings belonged to her. Colin would catch her up on all the latest developments in his investigation directly after dinner.\n Dreyson proved to be very helpful. He found out a policy had been taken out on Victoria\u0027s life just four months before her disappearance. The beneficiary named on the contract was her brother, Neil. The policy was underwritten by Morton and Sons.\n Through his sources, Colin found out Neil would inherit his sister\u0027s sizable dowry, set aside on the day she was born by a distant aunt, if she didn\u0027t return to London to claim it.\n Sir Richards had joined them at the dinner table. He listened while Colin explained to Alesandra what he\u0027d learned, then interjected a comment of his own.\n \"Until a body is found he can\u0027t collect the insurance money or the inheritance. If he\u0027s the culprit and his motive was money, why would he go to such lengths to hide her body?\"\n \"It doesn\u0027t make much sense,\" Colin agreed. \"He has a large bank account of his own.\"\n Sir Richards agreed with a nod. \"He might think he needed more,\" he said. \"Alesandra did tell us Neil didn\u0027t particularly like his sister,\" he added. \"There\u0027s another bit of damning evidence wagging its finger in Neil\u0027s direction, too, circumstantial though it is. You see, he offered for Roberta six years ago but she turned him down in favor of the viscount. Rumor has it Neil continued to pursue her even after she was married. Some believe she was having an affair with him. And there, you see, is the tie-in between the two women.\"\n \"I can\u0027t imagine any woman wanting to be with Neil Perry,\" Alesandra whispered. \"He isn\u0027t at all… charming.\"\n \"Have you received any other gifts?\" he asked.\n She shook her head. \"The gift I ordered made for Nathan and Sara arrived this morning. Colin almost destroyed the thing in a rage before he remembered I\u0027d ordered the ship. Thankfully, he only shredded the box.\"\n \"You failed to mention you had the gift outlined with strips of gold,\" Colin said. \"It would take five men to destroy it.\"\n Caine interrupted the talk when he came rushing into the dining room.\n \"They found Victoria\u0027s body!\"\n Colin reached over and covered Alesandra\u0027s hand. \"Where?\" he asked.\n \"In a field about an hour\u0027s ride from here. A cropper happened upon the grave. Wolves had…\" Caine stopped in midsentence. The look on Alesandra\u0027s face showed her anguish. Caine wasn\u0027t about to add to her heartache by going into more vivid detail.\n \"The authorities are certain it\u0027s Victoria?\" she asked.\n Her eyes filled with tears, but she forced herself to remain in control. She could weep for Victoria later—pray for her soul, too—and she would do both… after the man who\u0027d hurt her had been caught.\n \"The jewelry she wore… it helped with the identification,\" Caine explained.\n Sir Richards wanted to see where the body was found. He pushed his chair back and started to stand up.\n \"It\u0027s too dark to see anything,\" Caine told the director. He pulled out the chair next to Alesandra and sat down. \"You\u0027re going to have to wait until tomorrow.\"\n \"Who owns the field where she was found?\" Colin asked.\n \"Neil Perry.\"\n \"How convenient,\" Colin said.\n \"It\u0027s too damned convenient,\" Caine agreed.\n \"We take what we\u0027re given,\" Richards announced. \"Then we pull it apart to find the truth.\"\n \"When will you have your men start digging?\" Colin asked.\n \"Tomorrow at first light.\"\n \"Digging?\" Alesandra asked. \"Victoria\u0027s already been found. Why would you…\"\n \"We want to see what else we\u0027ll find,\" Richards explained.\n \"You believe Roberta might also be buried there?\"\n \"I do.\"\n \"So do I,\" Caine interjected.\n \"Neil wouldn\u0027t be so stupid as to bury his victims on his own land,\" she said.\n \"We believe he\u0027s probably the culprit,\" Caine said. \"We don\u0027t believe he\u0027s clever.\"\n She grabbed hold of Caine\u0027s hand so he would give her his full attention. \"But that\u0027s just it,\" she argued. \"He\u0027s been clever until now, hasn\u0027t he? Why would he bury either woman on his own land? It doesn\u0027t make sense. You\u0027re forgetting something else, too.\"\n \"What\u0027s that?\" Caine asked.\n \"All of you are assuming there are only two women. There could be more.\"\n \"She\u0027s got a point, Caine,\" Colin agreed. \"Sweetheart, let go of my brother.\"\n She realized she was squeezing Caine\u0027s hand then and quickly let go. She turned her attention to the director. \"What are your other plans?\"\n \"Neil will certainly be charged,\" he announced. \"It\u0027s just a start, Alesandra. Like you, I\u0027m not completely convinced he\u0027s the one. I don\u0027t like conveniences.\"\n She was satisfied with his answer. She excused herself from the table. Caine stood up and pulled her chair back for her. She turned to thank him. She was surprised when he put his hands on her shoulders and leaned down. Before she could ask him what he was doing, he kissed her on her forehead. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/castles-crown-s-spies-4/page-40.html","bookId":1789,"book":{"id":1789,"title":"Castles (Crown\u0027s Spies #4)","description":"Storyline: \n Orphaned and besieged Princess Alesandra knew that only hasty marriage to an Englishman could protect her from the turmoil in her own land.
