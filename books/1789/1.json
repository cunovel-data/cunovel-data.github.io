{"id":78301,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"Prologue\\n\\n England, 1819\\n\\n He was a real lady killer.\\n\\n The foolish woman never had a chance. She never knew she was being stalked, never guessed her secret admirer\u0027s real intent.\\n\\n He believed he killed her with kindness. He was proud of that accomplishment. He could have been cruel. He wasn\u0027t. The craving eating away at him demanded to be appeased, and even though erotic thoughts of torture aroused him to a fever pitch, he hadn\u0027t given in to the base urge. He was a man, not an animal. He was after self-gratification, and the chit certainly deserved to die, yet he\u0027d still shown true compassion. He had been very kind—considering.\\n\\n She had, after all, died smiling. He deliberately caught her so by surprise he only glimpsed one quick spasm of terror in her cow brown eyes before it was over. He crooned to her then, like any good master would croon to his injured pet, letting her hear the sound of his compassion all the while he was strangling her, and he didn\u0027t stop his song of sympathy until the killing was finished and he knew she couldn\u0027t hear him.\\n\\n He hadn\u0027t been without mercy. Even when he was certain she was dead, he gently turned her face away from him before he allowed himself to smile. He wanted to laugh, with relief because it was finally over, and with satisfaction because it had gone so very well, but he didn\u0027t dare make a sound now, for somewhere in the back of his mind lurked the thought that such undignified behavior would make him seem more monster than man, and he certainly wasn\u0027t a monster. No, no, he didn\u0027t hate women, he admired them—most anyway—and to those he considered redeemable, he was neither cruel nor heartless.\\n\\n He was terribly clever though. There wasn\u0027t any shame in admitting that truth. The chase had been invigorating, but from start to finish he had been able to predict her every reaction. Granted, her own vanity had helped him immensely. She was a naive chit who thought of herself as worldly—a dangerous misconception—and he had proven to be far too cunning for the likes of her.\\n\\n There had been sweet irony in his choice of weapons. He had planned to use his dagger to kill her. He wanted to feel the blade sink deep inside her, craved the feel of her hot blood as it poured over his hands each time he slammed the knife into her soft, smooth skin. Carve the fowl, carve the fowl. The command echoed in his mind. He hadn\u0027t given in to his desire, however, for he was still stronger than his inner voice, and on the spur of the moment he decided not to use the dagger at all. The diamond necklace he\u0027d given her was draped around her neck. He grabbed hold of the expensive trinket and used it to squeeze the life out of her. He thought the weapon was most appropriate. Women liked trinkets, this one more than most. He even considered burying the necklace with her, but just as he was about to pour the clumps of lime over her body he\u0027d gathered from the cliffs to hurry the decay, he changed his inclination and put the necklace in his pocket.\\n\\n He walked away from the grave without a backward glance. He felt no remorse, no guilt. She\u0027d served him well and now he was content.\\n\\n A thick mist covered the ground. He didn\u0027t notice the lime powder on his boots until he had reached the main road. He wasn\u0027t bothered by the fact that his new Wellingtons were probably ruined. Nothing was going to blemish his glow of victory. He felt as though all his burdens had been lifted away. But there was more, too—the rush he\u0027d felt again, that magnificent euphoria he\u0027d experienced when he had his hands on her… Oh, yes, this one was even better than the last.\\n\\n She\u0027d made him feel alive again. The world was once again rosy with choices for such a strong, virile man.\\n\\n He knew he would feed on the memory of tonight for a long, long while. And then, when the glow began to ebb, he would go hunting again.\\n\\n Chapter 1\\n\\n Mother Superior Mary Felicity had always believed in miracles, but in all of her sixty-seven years on this sweet earth, she had never actually witnessed one until the frigid day in February of 1820 when the letter arrived from England.\\n\\n At first the mother superior had been afraid to believe the blessed news, for she feared it was trickery on the devil\u0027s part to get her hopes up and then dash them later, but after she had dutifully answered the missive and received a second confirmation with the Duke of Williamshire\u0027s seal affixed, she accepted the gift for what it truly was.\\n\\n A miracle.\\n\\n They were finally going to get rid of the hellion. The mother superior shared her good news with the other nuns the following morning at matins. That evening they celebrated with duck soup and freshly baked black bread. Sister Rachael was positively giddy and had to be admonished twice for laughing out loud during evening vespers.\\n\\n The hellion—or, rather, Princess Alesandra—was called into the mother superior\u0027s stark office the following afternoon. While she was being given the news of her departure from the convent, Sister Rachael was busy packing her bags.\\n\\n The mother superior sat in a high-backed chair behind a wide desk as scarred and old as she was. The nun absentmindedly fingered the heavy wooden beads of her rosary, hooked to the side of her black habit, while she waited for her charge to react to the announcement.\\n\\n Princess Alesandra was stunned by the news. She gripped her hands together in a nervous gesture and kept her head bowed so the mother superior wouldn\u0027t see the tears in her eyes.\\n\\n \"Do sit down, Alesandra. I don\u0027t wish to talk to the top of your head.\"\\n\\n \"As you wish, Mother.\" She sat on the very edge of the hard chair, straightened her posture to please the superior, and then clasped her hands together in her lap.\\n\\n \"What do you think of this news?\" the mother superior asked.\\n\\n \"It was the fire, wasn\u0027t it, Mother? You still haven\u0027t forgiven me that mishap.\"\\n\\n \"Nonsense,\" the mother superior replied. \"I forgave you that thoughtlessness over a month ago.\"\\n\\n \"Was it Sister Rachael who convinced you to send me away? I did tell her how sorry I was, and her face isn\u0027t nearly as green anymore.\"\\n\\n The mother superior shook her head. She frowned, too, for Alesandra was inadvertently getting her all riled up over the reminders of some of her antics.\\n\\n \"Why you believed that vile paste would remove freckles is beyond my understanding. However, Sister Rachael did agree to the experiment. She doesn\u0027t blame you… overly much,\" she hastened to add so the lie she was telling would only be considered a venial sin in God\u0027s eyes. \"Alesandra, I didn\u0027t write to your guardian requesting your leave. He wrote to me. Here is the Duke of Williamshire\u0027s letter. Read it and then you\u0027ll see I\u0027m telling you the truth.\"\\n\\n Alesandra\u0027s hand shook when she reached for the missive. She quickly scanned the contents before handing the letter back to her superior.\\n\\n \"You can see the urgency, can\u0027t you? This General Ivan your guardian mentions sounds quite disreputable. Do you remember meeting him?\"\\n\\n Alesandra shook her head. \"We visited father\u0027s homeland several times, but I was very young. I don\u0027t remember meeting him. Why in heaven\u0027s name would he want to marry me?\"\\n\\n \"Your guardian understands the general\u0027s motives,\" the mother superior replied. She tapped the letter with her fingertips. \"Your father\u0027s subjects haven\u0027t forgotten you. You\u0027re still their beloved princess. The general has a notion that if he marries you, he\u0027ll be able to take over the kingdom with the support of the masses. It\u0027s a clever plan.\"\\n\\n \"But I don\u0027t wish to marry him,\" Alesandra whispered.\\n\\n \"And neither does your guardian wish it,\" the superior said. \"He believes the general won\u0027t take no for an answer, however, and will take you by force if necessary to insure his success. That is why the Duke of Williamshire wants guards to journey with you to England.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want to leave here, Mother. I really don\u0027t.\"\\n\\n The anguish in Alesandra\u0027s voice tugged at the mother superior\u0027s heart. Forgotten for the moment were all the mischievous schemes Princess Alesandra had gotten involved in over the past years. The superior remembered the vulnerability and the fear in the little girl\u0027s eyes when she and her ailing mother had first arrived. Alesandra had been quite saintly while her mother lived. She had been so very young—only twelve—and had lost her dear father just six months before. Yet the child had shown tremendous strength. She took on the full responsibility of caring for her mother day and night. There was never any possibility her mother would recover. Her illness destroyed her body and her mind, and toward the end, when she had been crazed with her pain, Alesandra would climb into her mother\u0027s sickbed and take the frail woman into her arms. She would gently rock her back and forth and sing tender ballads to her, her voice that of an angel. Her love for her mother had been achingly beautiful to see. When at last the devil\u0027s torture was finished, her mother died in her daughter\u0027s arms.\\n\\n Alesandra wouldn\u0027t allow anyone to comfort her. She wept during the dark hours of the night, alone in her cell, the white curtains surrounding her cubicle blocking out none of her sobs from the postulants.\\n\\n Her mother was buried on the grounds behind the chapel in a lovely, flower-bordered grotto. Alesandra couldn\u0027t abide the thought of leaving her. The grounds of the convent were adjacent to the family\u0027s second home, Stone Haven, but Alesandra wouldn\u0027t even journey there for a visitation. \"I had thought I would stay here forever,\" Alesandra whispered.\\n\\n \"You must look upon this as your destiny unfolding,\" the mother superior advised. \"One chapter of your life is closing and another is about to open up.\"\\n\\n Alesandra lowered her head again. \"I wish to have all my chapters here, Mother. You could deny the Duke of Williamshire\u0027s request if you wished, or stall him with endless correspondence until he forgot about me\"\\n\\n \"And the general?\"\\n\\n Alesandra had already thought of an answer to that dilemma. \"He wouldn\u0027t dare breach this sanctuary. I\u0027m safe as long as I stay here.\"\\n\\n \"A man lusting for power will not care if he breaks the holy laws governing this convent, Alesandra. He certainly would breach our sanctuary. Do you realize you are also suggesting I deceive your dear guardian?\"\\n\\n The nun\u0027s voice held a note of reproach in it. \"No, Mother,\" Alesandra answered with a little sigh, knowing full well that was the answer the nun wished to hear. \"I suppose it would be wrong to deceive…\"\\n\\n The wistfulness in her voice made the mother superior shake her head. \"I will not accommodate you. Even if there was a valid reason…\"\\n\\n Alesandra jumped on the possibility. \"Oh, but there is,\" she blurted out. She took a deep breath, then announced, \"I have decided to become a nun.\"\\n\\n The mere thought of Alesandra joining their holy order sent chills down the mother superior\u0027s spine. \"Heaven help us all,\" she muttered.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s because of the books, isn\u0027t it, Mother? You want to send me away because of that little… fabrication.\"\\n\\n \"Alesandra…\"\\n\\n \"I only made the second set of books so the banker would give you the loan. You refused to use my funds, and I knew how much you needed the new chapel… what with the fire and all. And you did get the loan, didn\u0027t you? God has surely forgiven me my deception, and He must have wanted me to alter the numbers in the accounts or He never would have given me such a fine head for figures. Would he, Mother Superior? In my heart, I know He forgave me my bit of trickery.\"\\n\\n \"Trickery? I believe the correct word is larceny,\" the mother superior snapped.\\n\\n \"Nay, Mother,\" Alesandra corrected. \"Larceny means to pilfer and I didn\u0027t pilfer anything. I merely amended.\"\\n\\n The fierce frown on the superior\u0027s face told Alesandra she shouldn\u0027t have contradicted her, or brought up the still tender topic of the bookkeeping.\\n\\n \"About the fire…\"\\n\\n \"Mother, I have already confessed my sorrow over that unfortunate mishap,\" Alesandra rushed out. She hurried to change the subject before the superior could get all riled up again. \"I was very serious when I said I would like to become a nun. I believe I have the calling.\"\\n\\n \"Alesandra, you aren\u0027t Catholic.\"\\n\\n \"I would convert,\" Alesandra fervently promised.\\n\\n A long minute passed in silence. Then the mother superior leaned forward. The chair squeaked with her movement. \"Look at me,\" she commanded.\\n\\n She waited until the princess had complied with her order before speaking again. \"I believe I understand what this is really all about. I\u0027m going to give you a promise,\" she said, her voice a soothing whisper. \"I\u0027ll take good care of your mother\u0027s grave. If anything should happen to me, then Sister Justina or Sister Rachael will tend to it. Your mother won\u0027t be forgotten. She\u0027ll continue to be in our prayers every day. That is my promise to you.\"\\n\\n Alesandra burst into tears. \"I cannot leave her.\"\\n\\n The mother superior stood up and hurried over to Alesandra\u0027s side. She put her arm around her shoulders and patted her. \"You won\u0027t be leaving her behind. She will always be in your heart. She would want you to get on with your life.\"\\n\\n Tears streamed down Alesandra\u0027s face. She mopped them away with the backs of her hands. \"I don\u0027t know the Duke of Williamshire, Mother. I only met him once and I barely recall what he looked like. What if I don\u0027t get along with him? What if he doesn\u0027t want me? I don\u0027t want to be a burden to anyone. Please let me stay here.\"\\n\\n \"Alesandra, you seem determined to believe I have a choice in the matter and that simply isn\u0027t true. I too must obey your guardian\u0027s request. You\u0027re going to do just fine in England. The Duke of Williamshire has six children of his own. One more isn\u0027t going to be a bother.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not a child any longer,\" Alesandra reminded the nun. \"And my guardian is probably very old and weary by now.\"\\n\\n The mother superior smiled. \"The Duke of Williamshire was chosen and named guardian over you years ago by your father. He had good reason for naming the Englishman. Have faith in your father\u0027s judgment.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, Mother.\"\\n\\n \"You can lead a happy life, Alesandra,\" the mother superior continued. \"As long as you remember to use a little restraint. Think before you act. That\u0027s the key. You have a sound mind. Use it.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you for saying so, Mother.\"\\n\\n \"Quit acting so submissive. It isn\u0027t like you at all I have one more bit of advice to offer you and I want your full attention. Do sit up straight. A princess does not slump.\"\\n\\n If she sat any straighter, she thought, her spine might snap. Alesandra thrust her shoulders back a bit more and knew she\u0027d satisfied the nun when she nodded.\\n\\n \"As I was saying,\" the mother superior continued. \"It never mattered here that you were a princess, but it will matter in England. Appearances must be kept up at all times. You simply cannot allow spontaneous actions to rule your life. Now tell me, Alesandra, what are the two words I\u0027ve asked you again and again to take to heart?\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/castles-crown-s-spies-4/page-1.html","bookId":1789,"book":{"id":1789,"title":"Castles (Crown\u0027s Spies #4)","description":"Storyline: Orphaned and besieged Princess Alesandra knew that only hasty marriage to an Englishman could protect her from the turmoil in her own land.
