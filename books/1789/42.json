But Colin was cautious to a fault, she thought to herself. \"Catherine, I believe you should stay here with us,\" Alesandra blurted out. \"Why?\" Why indeed? Alesandra\u0027s mind hunted for a reason. She turned to Jade, silently imploring her help. Caine\u0027s wife was very astute. She caught the worry in Alesandra\u0027s eyes and immediately voiced her agreement. \"Yes, you should stay with us,\" she told Catherine. \"Sterns will be happy to send a note to Morgan explaining a family matter has come up and you aren\u0027t able to keep your appointment.\" \"But I wish to keep my appointment,\" Catherine argued. \"Mother, this isn\u0027t fair. Michelle Marie is going riding with the Earl of Hampton. Her sisters don\u0027t tell her what to do.\" \"We aren\u0027t telling you what to do,\" Alesandra countered. \"We just don\u0027t want you to go.\" \"Why not?\" Catherine\u0027s frustration made her voice shrill. Thankfully, Alesandra was saved from having to come up with an answer, for Nathan and his wife walked into the room, drawing everyone\u0027s attention. Alesandra literally bounded to her feet. She hurried across the room to meet Sara. Nathan\u0027s wife was a beautiful woman. She had dark brown hair, a flawless complexion, and eyes the color of a clear blue sky. Her smile was enchanting, too. It was filled with warmth. Nathan introduced her to his wife. Alesandra wasn\u0027t certain if she should formally curtsy or take hold of Sara\u0027s hand. Her dilemma didn\u0027t last long. The woman was openly affectionate. She immediately walked forward and embraced Alesandra. It wasn\u0027t possible to feel awkward around Sara. She treated Alesandra as though she were a long-lost friend. \"Where is Joanna?\" Alesandra asked. \"Olivia\u0027s bringing her down,\" Sara explained. \"With Sterns\u0027s assistance,\" Nathan interjected. He turned to his wife then. \"Sweetheart, I\u0027m going back upstairs to finish with the ledgers.\" Jade called out to Sara and patted the cushion next to her. Alesandra didn\u0027t follow. She chased after Nathan. She caught him halfway up the stairs. \"May I please speak to you in private for just a moment?\" \"Certainly,\" Nathan answered. \"Will the study do?\" She nodded. She followed him up the rest of the stairs and into the study. Nathan motioned to a chair, but she declined the invitation to sit. The room was a clutter of maps and ledgers. Nathan had obviously turned Caine\u0027s study into a secondary shipping office. She made that mention to him as he walked across the room. \"Caine\u0027s library is downstairs,\" Nathan explained. \"He won\u0027t let me inside. He won\u0027t come inside this room, either,\" he added with a grin. \"My brother-in-law is a fanatic about order. He can\u0027t stand the mess. Have a seat, Alesandra, and tell me what\u0027s on your mind.\" She again declined the invitation to sit. \"This will only take a minute,\" she explained. \"Catherine wishes to go riding with Morgan Atkins. He\u0027s coming here to fetch her. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a good idea to let her go, Nathan, but I can\u0027t come up with a suitable argument why. She\u0027s very determined.\" \"Why don\u0027t you want her to go?\" She could have gone into a lengthy and surely confusing explanation that wouldn\u0027t make any sense at all, but she decided not to waste Nathan\u0027s time. \"I\u0027m just uneasy about it,\" she said. \"And I know Colin wouldn\u0027t let her go. Neither one of us is convinced Neil Perry is the guilty man, and until we are convinced we don\u0027t want Catherine going anywhere. Colin isn\u0027t here to tell his sister no, and her mother won\u0027t be able to sway her. Will you please handle this? I don\u0027t believe Catherine would dare argue with you.\" Nathan started for the door. \"So Colin doesn\u0027t trust this Atkins?\" \"Oh, no, I didn\u0027t mean to imply that,\" she said. \"Morgan\u0027s a friend of Colin\u0027s.\" She lowered her voice when she added, \"He\u0027s taken over Colin\u0027s position in the department under Sir Richards\u0027s supervision.\" \"But you believe Colin wouldn\u0027t wish her to go. All right. I\u0027ll take care of it.\" \"What excuse are you going to give her?\" Alesandra asked as she hurried after the giant. \"None,\" Nathan answered. He smiled then, a rascal\u0027s smile to be sure. \"I don\u0027t need a reason. I\u0027ll simply tell her she\u0027s staying here.\" \"And if she argues?\" Nathan laughed. \"It isn\u0027t what I\u0027m going to say to her, it\u0027s how I\u0027ll say it. Trust me, Alesandra. She won\u0027t argue. There are only two women in this world I can\u0027t intimidate. My sister and my wife. Don\u0027t worry, I\u0027ll take care of it.\" \"Actually, Nathan, there are three. You can\u0027t intimidate Jade, Sara, or me.\" She smiled over the look of surprise in his eyes but didn\u0027t dare laugh. The duchess was waiting in the foyer to say good-bye to both Alesandra and Nathan. She had an important dinner party to prepare for, she explained. She kissed Alesandra on her cheek, then made Nathan lean down so she could kiss him, too. Alesandra assumed Catherine was still inside the salon. She turned to go inside before Nathan so she could pretend she hadn\u0027t interfered. Catherine was already a little irritated with her because she\u0027d broken her word to her and Alesandra didn\u0027t want to add another sin to her list. Sara was sitting on the settee. Little Olivia sat next to her and was holding the baby in her lap. \"I do hope Joanna turns out to be as pretty as you are,\" Sara told Olivia. \"Probably she won\u0027t,\" Olivia replied. \"She doesn\u0027t have enough hair to be as pretty as me.\" Jade rolled her eyes heavenward. Sara smiled. \"She\u0027s still young,\" she said. \"She might grow more.\" \"Where\u0027s Catherine?\" Alesandra asked as she crossed the room. \"Nathan wants to have a word with her.\" \"She left a few minutes ago,\" Jade answered. Alesandra immediately jumped to the conclusion that Catherine had left with her mother. She sat down next to Olivia to look at the baby. \"Was she very angry we interfered with her plans? She\u0027s probably giving her mother a fit right about now. Oh, Sara, Joanna\u0027s beautiful. She\u0027s so tiny.\" \"She\u0027ll get bigger,\" Olivia announced. \"Babies do. Mama says so.\" \"Alesandra, Catherine didn\u0027t go home with her mother. She left with Morgan. We did try to make her change her mind, but without a valid reason at hand her mother finally relented. Catherine can cry at the drop of a hat, and I believe her mother didn\u0027t want a scene.\" The baby started fretting. Sara took her daughter into her arms and stood up. \"It\u0027s time for her nap,\" she announced. \"I\u0027ll be right back down. Sterns will snatch her out of my hands as soon as he can. The man\u0027s a wonder with infants, isn\u0027t he, Jade?\" \"He\u0027s a wonder with four-year-old\u0027s too,\" Jade replied. She turned her attention to her daughter. \"It\u0027s time for your nap, too, Olivia.\" Her daughter didn\u0027t want to leave. Jade insisted. She took Olivia\u0027s hand and pulled her along. \"I\u0027m not a baby, Mama.\" \"I know you\u0027re not, Olivia,\" Jade answered. \"And that\u0027s why you only take one nap a day. Joanna takes two.\" Alesandra sat down on the settee and watched Jade drag her daughter out of the room. Nathan stood in the doorway. \"Do you want me to go after Catherine?\" he asked. She shook her head. \"I\u0027m just a worrier, Nathan. I\u0027m certain it will be all right.\" The front door opened just then and both Caine and Colin walked inside. Caine stood in the foyer talking to Nathan, but Colin immediately went into the salon to his wife. He sat down beside her, hauled her up against him, and kissed her. \"Well?\" she demanded when he began to nuzzle on the side of her neck and didn\u0027t immediately tell her what happened. \"He\u0027s probably guilty,\" Colin announced. Caine and Nathan walked inside to join them. Alesandra nudged Colin so he would quit nibbling on her earlobe. Her husband let out a sigh before straightening away from her. He smiled when he saw her blush. \"He had motive and opportunity,\" Colin remarked then. Caine heard his brother\u0027s comment. \"I think we\u0027re trying to make this more complicated than it really is. I\u0027ll admit it\u0027s… convenient.\" Colin nodded. He pulled out his list. \"All right, sweetheart. Here are your answers. First, Neil denies that he went with his sister to meet a man calling himself her admirer. Second, he swears he didn\u0027t know anything about an insurance policy. And third, he vehemently denies being involved with Lady Roberta.\" \"I expected those answers,\" Alesandra announced. \"He wasn\u0027t much of a brother to Victoria,\" Caine interjected. He sat down and let out a loud yawn. \"What about my other question to Neil?\" \"Which one was that?\" Colin asked. \"I wanted the names of the suitors Victoria turned down. He mentioned there were three when he visited me and I thought those rejections might be important. Honestly, Colin, did you forget to ask him?\" \"No, I didn\u0027t forget. There was Burke—he\u0027s married now so he wouldn\u0027t count—and Mazelton.\" \"He\u0027s getting married soon,\" Caine interjected. \"And?\" Alesandra asked when Colin didn\u0027t continue. \"Who was the third man?\" \"Morgan Atkins,\" said Caine. Colin nodded. Alesandra glanced over at Nathan. He was frowning. \"Colin, isn\u0027t Morgan a friend of yours?\" he asked. \"Hell, no,\" Colin answered. \"He probably wants to throttle me about now. He blames me for a situation that developed and he messed up.\" Nathan leaned forward. \"Would he blame you enough to come after your wife?\" Colin\u0027s expression changed. He started to shake his head, then stopped himself. \"It\u0027s a possibility,\" he admitted. \"Remote, but… what are you thinking, Nathan?\" His partner turned to look at Alesandra. They said her name in unison. \"Catherine.\" Chapter 15 \"We did not panic.\" \"Yes, we did,\" Alesandra replied. She smiled at her husband while she contradicted him, then turned her attention back to her task. Both she and her husband were in bed. Colin was stretched out on his back and had pillows propped behind his head. Alesandra knelt at the foot of the bed. She wrung out another long strip of cotton and applied it to her husband\u0027s leg. The heat from the water made her fingers red, but the mild discomfort was certainly rewarded by Colin\u0027s loud sighs of pleasure. Her husband had barely grumbled when she had handed him the list of suggestions Sir Winters had made. He refused both pain medication and liquor, but he took the time to explain why. He didn\u0027t wish to become dependent on either and so he went without, regardless of how painful the leg became. The hot cloths helped take the cramp out of his calf, however, and as long as she kept him busy thinking about something else, he forgot to be sensitive or embarrassed about the scars. He certainly wasn\u0027t embarrassed about the rest of his body. He was a bit of an exhibitionist, too. Alesandra wore a prim pink and white high-necked sleeping gown and matching robe. Colin wasn\u0027t wearing anything. His hands were stacked behind his head, and when he let out another long sigh, she decided her husband was thoroughly uninhibited with her… and just as content. \"I will admit Caine did run around a bit, but only because there was the slightest chance Morgan might somehow be involved.\" \"Ran around a bit? Surely you jest, Colin. The man picked up his wife and tossed her into his open carriage, then went racing toward the park after Catherine.\" Colin grinned over the picture. \"All right, he did panic. I didn\u0027t, however.\" She let out an inelegant snort. \"Then I didn\u0027t see you leap over the side of their carriage so you wouldn\u0027t be left behind?\" \"Better safe than sorry, Alesandra.\" \"And all for nought,\" she said. \"Catherine would have died of mortification if Caine and you had caught up with her. Thank heaven Morgan took her home before her brothers spotted her. This is all my fault, by the way.\" \"What\u0027s all your fault?\" \"I got everyone all worked up,\" she admitted. \"I shouldn\u0027t have made your relatives so worried.\" \"They\u0027re your relatives, too,\" he reminded her. She nodded. \"Why do you think Victoria turned Morgan down?\" The switch in topics didn\u0027t throw Colin. He was getting used to the way his wife\u0027s mind raced from one thought to another. She was an extremely logical woman—damned intelligent, too—and for those reasons he no longer shrugged off any concerns she might have. If she wasn\u0027t completely convinced Neil was the culprit, then he wasn\u0027t completely convinced either. \"Morgan\u0027s up to his neck in debt and could very well lose his estates.\" \"How do you know that?\" \"Richards told me,\" he answered. \"Maybe Victoria thought she could do better.\" \"Yes,\" Alesandra agreed. \"That is possible, I suppose.\" \"Sweetheart, let\u0027s go to bed.\" She scooted off the bed and put the bowl of water on the bench near the window. Then she removed the wet strips from his leg, folded them, and put them next to the bowl. \"Colin, are you feeling guilty because you wouldn\u0027t listen to me when I tried to talk to you about Victoria?\" \"Hell, yes, I\u0027m feeling guilty. Every time you brought up the topic, I told you to leave it alone.\" \"Good.\" He opened one eye to look at her. \"Good? You want me to feel guilty?\" She smiled. \"Yes,\" she answered. She took off her robe, draped it over the edge of the bed, and began unbuttoning her gown. \"It\u0027s good because I now have the upper hand in negotiating.\" He grinned over her choice of words and her expression. She looked so serious. \"What exactly do you want to negotiate?\" \"Our sleeping arrangement. I\u0027m going to sleep in your bed all night, Colin. It won\u0027t do you any good to argue.\" Alesandra quit trying to get her sleeping gown off and hurried to get into bed. She thought it would be more difficult for Colin to deny her demand if she was already settled next to him. She pulled the covers over her, fluffed her pillow, and then said, \"If guilt doesn\u0027t sway you, then I\u0027ll have to remind you of my delicate condition. You won\u0027t deny the mother of your child anything.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/castles-crown-s-spies-4/page-42.html","bookId":1789,"book":{"id":1789,"title":"Castles (Crown\u0027s Spies #4)","description":"Storyline: Orphaned and besieged Princess Alesandra knew that only hasty marriage to an Englishman could protect her from the turmoil in her own land.
