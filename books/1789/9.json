{"id":78309,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"Neither one said another word to the other for a long, long while. They were escorted to the prince regent\u0027s box and took their seats side by side. The opera house was filled to capacity, but Colin was certain only Alesandra watched the performance. Everyone else watched her. She pretended not to be aware of their stares. She impressed the hell out of Colin, too. She looked so beautifully composed. Her posture was ramrod straight, and she never once turned her attention from the stage. He could see her hands, however. They were clenched tight in her lap. He moved a little closer to her. Then he reached over and covered her hands with one of his. She didn\u0027t turn her gaze to him, but she latched on to his hand and held tight. They stayed like that through the rest of the performance. The white starched cravat around his neck was driving him crazy. He wanted to tear the thing off, prop his feet up on the railing overlooking the stage, and close his eyes. Alesandra would probably have heart palpitations if he dared to behave so shamefully. He wouldn\u0027t embarrass her, of course, but, God, how he hated all the pretense associated with the ton\u0027s affairs. He hated having to sit in the prince regent\u0027s box, too. Nathan would bellow for a week if he found out. His partner disliked their ruler even more than Colin did, for it was his wife who had been cheated out of her inheritance by the not-so-noble prince. The god-awful opera he was being subjected to didn\u0027t improve his cranky disposition. He did close his eyes then, and tried to block out the sounds of screeching coming from the stage. Alesandra didn\u0027t realize until the performance was over that Colin had fallen asleep. She turned to ask him if he had enjoyed the opera as much as she had, but just as she was about to speak, he started to snore. She almost laughed. It took all she had to keep her expression composed. The opera really had been dreadful, and in her heart she wished she could have slept through the ordeal. She would never admit such a thing to Colin, however, for the simple reason that she knew he would gloat. She nudged him hard with her elbow. Colin came awake with a start. \"You really are impossible,\" she told him in a whisper. He gave her a sleepy-eyed grin. \"I like to think I am.\" It simply wasn\u0027t possible to offend him. She gave up trying. She stood up, took hold of her cloak, and turned to leave the box. Colin followed her. There was a crush of people in the foyer below. Most were waiting to get a closer look at her. Alesandra found herself surrounded by gentlemen begging an introduction. She lost Colin in the shuffle, and when she finally located him again, she saw he was surrounded by ladies. One, a gaudy redheaded woman with exposed bosoms down to her knees, was hanging on Colin\u0027s arm. The woman kept licking her upper lip, and Alesandra was reminded of a hungry alley cat that had just spotted a bowl of cream. Colin appeared to be the woman\u0027s snack. Alesandra tried to pay attention to what was being said to her by a gentleman who\u0027d introduced himself as the Earl of something or other, but her gaze kept returning to Colin. He looked very happy with all the attention he was getting, and for some strange reason that notice infuriated Alesandra. It hit her all at once, this unreasonable burst of jealousy. And, Lord, it was the most horrible feeling. She simply couldn\u0027t stand to see the woman\u0027s hand on Colin\u0027s arm. She was more disgusted with herself than with Colin. Since the moment she\u0027d arrived in England, she\u0027d been trying to behave the way she thought a princess should behave. The mother superior\u0027s two sainted words, dignity and decorum echoed in her mind. Alesandra remembered the nun\u0027s warning to avoid spontaneous actions. She\u0027d pointed out over ten examples of trouble that had resulted because of her spur-of-the-moment ideas. Alesandra let out a sigh. She guessed marching over to Colin\u0027s side and ripping that horrible woman\u0027s hand off his arm would qualify as a spontaneous action. Further, she knew the gossip tomorrow would make her sorry for her action. It felt as though the foyer was closing in on her. No one appeared to be in a hurry to leave. More and more people crowded into the tiny area to see who was there and to be seen. She desperately needed fresh air. She excused herself from the gentleman requesting an audience with her by giving him permission to send her a note, then slowly made her way through the throng of people to the front doors. She didn\u0027t care if Colin followed her or not. She went outside. She paused on the front step, took a deep breath of the not-so-fresh city air, and put on her cloak. Colin\u0027s carriage was directly below her. Raymond spotted her right away. He jumped down from his perch, where he\u0027d been waiting with the driver. Alesandra lifted the hem of her gown and started down the steps. Someone grabbed hold of her arm. She thought it was Colin finally catching up with her. His grip stung. She tried to pull her arm away, then turned to tell him to lessen his hold. It wasn\u0027t Colin. The stranger holding on to her was dressed in black from head to foot. He wore a cap that covered most of his brow. She could barely see his face. \"Let go of me,\" she commanded. \"You must come home with us now, Princess Alesandra.\" A chill settled around her heart. The man had spoken to her in the language of her father\u0027s homeland. She understood what was happening then. She tried not to panic. She pulled back and tried to run, but she was captured by another man from behind. He was hurting her with his fierce hold. Alesandra was suddenly too furious to think about the pain. With his friend\u0027s assistance, the man started to drag her back toward the side of the building. A third man appeared out of the shadows of the stone columns in front of the opera house and ran down the steps to stop Raymond from interfering. Her guard was charging up the steps to protect her. Raymond landed the first punch, but the man he\u0027d struck only staggered backward. Then he lashed out at her guard with something sharp. Alesandra saw the blood spurting down the side of Raymond\u0027s face and started screaming. A hand clamped down over her mouth, cutting off the sound. She bit her attacker as hard as she could. He let out a howl of pain while he shifted his hold on her. He was strangling her now. He kept telling her to quit her struggles or he would have to hurt her. Alesandra was terrified. She couldn\u0027t breathe. She kept up her struggle, determined to get away from the horrible men and run to Raymond. She had to help him. He could be bleeding to death, and, dear God, this was all her fault. She should have listened to Raymond when he insisted the general\u0027s men would come after her. She should have stayed home… she should have… She heard Colin before she saw him. A roar of fury unlike anything she\u0027d ever heard before sounded in the darkness. The man anchoring her from behind was suddenly ripped away from her and tossed headfirst into one of the stone pillars. He collapsed to the ground like a discarded apple core. Alesandra was coughing and gasping for air. The stranger holding on to her arm tried to pull her in front of him to use as a shield against Colin. He wouldn\u0027t allow that. He moved so quickly, Alesandra didn\u0027t have time to help. Colin\u0027s fist slammed into the man\u0027s face. Her attacker\u0027s cap went flying in one direction, and he went flying down the steps. He landed with a thud at Raymond\u0027s feet. Alesandra\u0027s guard was fully occupied circling his adversary, his concentration totally centered on the gleaming knife he held in his hand. Colin moved in from behind. The man turned to lash out at him. Colin kicked the blade out of his hand, moved forward again, and grabbed hold of his arm. He twisted it into an unnatural position. The bone snapped, and that horrid sound was followed by a scream of pain. Colin was not finished with his victim, however. He shoved him headfirst into the back of the carriage. Alesandra came running down the steps. She used the handkerchief from the bodice of her gown to stem the flow of blood pouring from the deep cut in Raymond\u0027s right cheek. Colin didn\u0027t know if there were others ready to strike or not, and in his mind Alesandra wasn\u0027t going to be safe until she was home. \"Get inside the carriage, Alesandra. Now.\" His voice was harsh with anger. She thought he was furious with her. She hurried to do as he commanded, but tried to take Raymond with her. She put his arm around her shoulder, braced herself for his weight, and whispered for him to lean on her. \"I\u0027ll be all right, Princess,\" Raymond told her. \"Get inside. It isn\u0027t safe for you here.\" Colin pulled her away from the guard. He half lifted, half tossed her into the carriage, then turned to help Raymond. If the guard had been in any condition to look after Alesandra, Colin would have stayed behind to get some answers out of the bastards who\u0027d dared to touch her. Raymond had lost quite a bit of blood, however, and now looked close to collapse. Colin let out a low expletive, then got inside. The driver immediately whistled the horses into a full trot. Alesandra sat next to the guard. \"I don\u0027t understand why no one helped us,\" she whispered. \"Couldn\u0027t they see we were in trouble?\" \"You were the only one outside, Princess,\" Raymond answered. He slumped into the corner of the carriage. \"It happened too fast. Why wasn\u0027t your escort with you?\" Raymond turned his head to glare at Colin when he asked his question. The handkerchief he held to his cheek was turning bright red. He adjusted the cloth against the cut, then turned to look at her. She folded her hands together in her lap and lowered her gaze. \"This is all my fault,\" she said. \"I was impatient and there was such a crowd inside. I wanted some fresh air. I should have waited.\" \"Damn right you should have waited.\" \"Please don\u0027t be angry with me, Colin.\" \"Where the hell was Hillman?\" \"The earl you introduced me to before you left me?\" \"I didn\u0027t leave you,\" he muttered. \"Hillman was introducing you to some of his friends and I turned my back for one minute to say hello to a couple of business associates. Damn it, Alesandra, if you wanted to leave why didn\u0027t you tell Hillman to come and get me?\" \"Nothing will be served by raising your voice to me. I accept full responsibility for what happened.\" She turned to her guard. \"Raymond, can you ever forgive me? I should have stayed home. I put you in danger…\" Colin interrupted. \"You don\u0027t have to hide behind lock and key, Alesandra. You just shouldn\u0027t have gone outside without me.\" \"They would have attacked even if you\u0027d been with me,\" she countered. He gave her a speculative look. \"Start explaining,\" he ordered. \"I will explain when you quit shouting at me.\" He hadn\u0027t been shouting, but she was obviously too upset to notice. She\u0027d taken her white gloves off. He watched as she folded the pair into a square and turned back to Raymond. She ordered Raymond to use the gloves for his bandage now that the handkerchief was saturated with blood. \"Damn it, Alesandra, you could have been hurt.\" \"And so could you, Colin,\" she responded. \"Raymond needs a physician.\" \"I\u0027ll send Flannaghan over to fetch Winters as soon as we get home.\" \"Is Winters your personal physician?\" \"Yes. Alesandra, did you know the men who attacked?\" \"No,\" she answered. \"At least, not by name. I know where they came from, though.\" \"They\u0027re fanatics,\" Raymond interjected. Alesandra couldn\u0027t bear to look at Colin\u0027s frown. She leaned back against the cushion of the seat and closed her eyes. \"The men are from my homeland. They want to take me back.\" \"For what purpose?\" \"To marry their bastard general,\" Raymond answered. \"Begging your pardon, Princess, for using that word in your presence, but Ivan is a bastard to be sure.\" Colin had to wait to ask additional questions because they\u0027d reached his town house. He wouldn\u0027t let Alesandra leave the safety of the carriage until he had the front door opened and had shouted for Stefan. Stefan came outside to assist Raymond, and Colin took hold of Alesandra. A good hour was spent seeing to Raymond\u0027s care. Colin\u0027s physician lived just three blocks away and was thankfully home for the evening. Flannaghan brought him back in Colin\u0027s carriage. Sir Winters was a white-haired man with brown eyes, a gentle voice, and an efficient matter. He believed thugs were responsible for the attack. No one set him straight on that misconception. \"It isn\u0027t safe to go anywhere in London anymore, what with the mob of ruffians roaming the streets. Something has got to be done, and soon, before every decent man and woman is killed.\" The physician stood in the center of the foyer, his hand on Raymond\u0027s jaw as he studied the damage done to his cheek and lamented the condition of London\u0027s streets. Colin suggested Raymond sit at the dining room table. Flannaghan carried in extra candles so the physician would have enough light. The cut was cleaned with a foul-smelling liquid, then stitched together with black thread. Raymond never once flinched during the painful ordeal. Alesandra flinched for him. She sat next to the guard, and when Winters applied the needle to his flesh, she reached over and took hold of Raymond\u0027s hand. Colin stood in the doorway, watching. His attention was centered on Alesandra. He could see how upset she was. There were tears in her eyes and her shoulders were shaking. Colin fought the urge to go and comfort her. Alesandra was such a gentle, compassionate woman, and Colin could well see her vulnerability, too. She was whispering something to the guard but he couldn\u0027t make out the words. He walked forward, then came to an abrupt stop when he understood what she was saying. Alesandra was giving her promise that nothing further would happen to the guard. Ivan, she said, would not make such a terrible husband, after all. She told the guard she\u0027d given the matter considerable consideration and had decided to return to her homeland. Raymond didn\u0027t look too happy with her promises. Colin was furious. \"You will not decide anything tonight, Alesandra,\" he commanded. She turned to look up at him. The anger in his voice surprised her. Why did he care what she decided? \"Yes, Princess,\" Raymond said, drawing her attention. \"Tomorrow will be soon enough to decide what should be done.\" Alesandra pretended agreement. She had already made up her mind, however. She wasn\u0027t going to let anyone else get hurt because of her. Until tonight she hadn\u0027t realized the lengths the general\u0027s supporters would go to in order to accomplish their goal. And if Colin hadn\u0027t intervened, Raymond might have been killed. Colin could have been injured, too. Oh, yes, she had made up her mind on the matter.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/castles-crown-s-spies-4/page-9.html","bookId":1789,"book":{"id":1789,"title":"Castles (Crown\u0027s Spies #4)","description":"Storyline: Orphaned and besieged Princess Alesandra knew that only hasty marriage to an Englishman could protect her from the turmoil in her own land.
