{"id":78320,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"The door closed behind Jade and Caine, and she realized then that Colin had already taken his leave. He hadn\u0027t even bothered to say good-bye. Alesandra was so hurt by his rudeness, she turned around to stare at the mantel so her guardian wouldn\u0027t see the tears in her eyes. Dignity and decorum, she silently chanted to herself. She would get through the wedding with her cloak of serenity tightly wrapped around her. If Colin was determined to be stupidly noble, then so be it. The castle caught her attention and the anger she was trying to stir up over Colin\u0027s high-handed methods in gaming her agreement was all but forgotten. A wave of homesickness for her mother and father made her ache inside. Dear God, she was miserable. She never should have left the convent—she realized that mistake now. She\u0027d been safe there, and the memories of her mother were somehow far more comforting. Alesandra took a deep breath in an attempt to stop the panic she could feel catching hold. She understood why she was so afraid. God help her, she was falling in love with the Dragon. It was unacceptable to her. Colin would never know how she felt about him. She wasn\u0027t about to end up like a vine of ivy clinging to a man who didn\u0027t love her. She wouldn\u0027t hover, either, no matter how much she wanted to, and she would force herself to think of the marriage as nothing but an arrangement. Colin had his reasons for marrying her, foolish though they were, and in return for his name and protection she would leave him to his own agenda. She wouldn\u0027t interfere in any way with his schedule, and in return for her consideration he would leave her alone to follow her own destiny. Alesandra mopped the tears from her eyes. She was feeling better now that she\u0027d come up with a viable plan of action. She would request an audience with Colin tomorrow and tell him how she had worked it all out in her mind. She would even allow for negotiating, but only on minor points, of course. \"Alesandra, your guards will bring your things over in just a little while.\" Her guardian made that announcement as he walked back into the salon. She turned to thank him. Uncle Henry frowned when he saw the tears in her eyes. \"What\u0027s this?\" he demanded. \"Are you so unhappy over my choice for your husband that you…\" She shook her head. \"I was looking at the castle and it made me a bit homesick.\" He looked relieved. He walked over to stand next to her. \"I believe I\u0027ll take that back to our country house. I don\u0027t like seeing it touched. Colin and Caine couldn\u0027t keep their hands off it, could they?\" he added with a grin. \"They can both be like bulls in a pen at times. I wouldn\u0027t want this treasure broken.\" He turned to look at the miniature. \"Do you know the story behind this gift?\" he asked. \"My mother told me Father gave it to you,\" Alesandra answered. \"The castle was a gift,\" Uncle Henry explained. \"But I was asking you if you\u0027d been told about the loan your father gave me? You have every right to hear it, and to know how your father came to my aid.\" His voice had gotten gruff with emotion. Alesandra shook her head. \"It wasn\u0027t a loan, Uncle, and, yes, I did know what happened. Mother told me the story because she thought it clever and amusing the way he tricked you.\" \"Nathaniel tricked me? How?\" Alesandra turned and lifted the castle from the mantel, nodding when her guardian instinctively warned her to be careful. While he watched, she pried the drawbridge away from the latch, then handed the castle to him. \"They\u0027ve been inside all the while,\" she explained, her voice a gentle whisper. \"Have a look, Uncle Henry. The notes are there.\" He couldn\u0027t seem to comprehend what she was telling him. He stared at her with a look of astonishment on his face. \"All these years…\" His voice cracked with tension and his eyes turned quite misty. \"Father liked to get his way,\" Alesandra explained. \"He insisted it was a gift and you insisted it was a loan. Mother told me you demanded notes be signed and father accommodated you. But he had the last laugh, Uncle, when he gave you the castle as a gift.\" \"With the notes.\" She put her hand on his arm. \"You hold the notes,\" she said. \"And you must therefore accept that the debt has been repaid.\" Her guardian held the castle up and looked inside. He spotted the folded pieces of paper immediately. \"The debt will be repaid when you marry my son,\" he said. He didn\u0027t have any idea how his words affected her. His attention was on the castle now, and he therefore missed the look on her face. She turned around and walked out of the salon. She passed Aunt Gweneth in the foyer but didn\u0027t trust her voice enough to speak. Gweneth hurried into the salon just as Alesandra ran up the steps. \"Henry, what did you say to that child?\" she demanded. Henry motioned her over to his side. \"Alesandra\u0027s fine, Gweneth. She\u0027s just feeling a little homesick, that\u0027s all. Let her have a few minutes alone. Look at this,\" he ordered then, his concentration turned back to the notes hidden inside the treasure. Alesandra was forgotten for the moment. She was thankful no one followed her up the stairs. She went into her uncle Henry\u0027s study, closed the door behind her, and promptly burst into tears. She cried for at least twenty minutes and all because she was feeling so horribly sorry for herself. She knew she was being childish—pitiful, too—but she didn\u0027t care. She didn\u0027t feel any better when she\u0027d finished weeping. Her nerves were still frazzled with worry and confusion. Dreyson arrived on the doorstep an hour later. She signed the papers he\u0027d prepared and then listened to his long explanation regarding the transfer of her funds from her father\u0027s homeland to the Bank of England. The agent Dreyson had hired to make the transaction was having difficulty getting the money released, but Dreyson assured her it wasn\u0027t anything to worry about. It would just take time and patience. Alesandra could barely concentrate on financial matters. She went to bed early that night and prayed for strength to get through the next three days. Time didn\u0027t drag, however. Aunt Gweneth kept her busy with the preparations for the wedding. Unbeknownst to her husband or her family, Gweneth invited a few close friends to join in the celebration—thirty-eight, in fact—and there was so much to be done before the wedding she could barely keep up with her lists of duties. There were fresh flowers to be ordered for the tables inside, food to be prepared for the formal sit-down dinner she planned on serving everyone, and a gown to be sewn by the sour-dispositioned but incredibly creative Millicent Norton. The dressmaker and her three assistants had taken over one of the larger rooms on the third floor and were working around the clock with their needles and threads on the yards and yards of imported lace Millicent Norton had been hoarding for just such an occasion. When Alesandra wasn\u0027t needed for fittings, she worked on the task Gweneth had assigned her—writing out the announcements. There were over two hundred names on her list. The envelopes had to be addressed too, of course, and Gweneth insisted they be ready to be sent out by messenger as soon as Colin and Alesandra were married. Alesandra didn\u0027t understand the need for all the fuss. She believed only the immediate family, the minister, and Sir Richards would be attending. She asked her aunt why she was going to all the trouble and was told that it was the very least she could do to repay the goodness Alesandra\u0027s father had shown her family. The day of the wedding finally arrived. The weather proved accommodating, much to Gweneth\u0027s delight. The garden could be used after all. The sun was bright and the temperature quite warm for spring. The guests wouldn\u0027t even need to wear cloaks, the duchess decided. She ordered the French doors opened and put the servants to work sweeping the stones clean. The ceremony was scheduled for four o\u0027clock in the afternoon. The flowers began arriving at noon. The parade of messengers seemed endless. Alesandra stayed in the dining room and out of everyone\u0027s way. Her Aunt Gweneth had really gone all out, she decided when she saw two huge vases of flowers being carried upstairs. She imagined the library was also going to be decorated. Perhaps Gweneth thought her husband might decide to entertain Sir Richards in the library. Alesandra was just about to go up to her room to get ready for the ceremony, but she was waylaid from that duty when Colin\u0027s sisters arrived. The youngest, Marian Rose, was only ten years old, and so thrilled to be included in the party she could barely stand still. Marian had been a happy surprise to her parents for, almost four years after their third daughter had been born, they had believed Gweneth\u0027s childbearing years were over. The youngest was doted upon by her parents and her older brothers, of course, but she was kept from being completely spoiled by her sisters. Alison was fourteen years old, Jennifer was fifteen, and Catherine had just turned sixteen. Alesandra liked all of Colin\u0027s sisters, but her favorite was Catherine. She was careful not to let the others know how she felt, fearing she would cause hurt feelings. Catherine was such a delight. She was the complete opposite of Alesandra, and perhaps that was the reason she liked her so much. She admitted she envied Colin\u0027s sister. Catherine was outrageously outspoken. One never had to guess what she might be thinking. She told her every thought. She was very dramatic, too, and was constantly getting into mischief with her dearest friend, Lady Michelle Marie. Catherine never worried about restraint. Alesandra doubted she fully understood what dignity and decorum were, and she was the most wonderfully honest person Alesandra had ever known. She was becoming a very pretty young lady, too. Catherine had dark blond hair and hazel-colored eyes. She was taller than Alesandra by a good two inches. None of Colin\u0027s sisters had been given the reason why they were being called to London, and when their mother gathered them together and explained about the wedding, Catherine was the first to screech with delight. She threw herself into Alesandra\u0027s arms and hugged her tight \"Michelle Marie will probably try to kill you for ruining her plans,\" she cheerfully informed Alesandra. \"She thinks she\u0027s going to marry Colin. She\u0027s planned it for years and years.\" Gweneth shook her head in exasperation. \"Colin\u0027s never even met your friend. Why in heaven\u0027s name would she believe he would marry her? She\u0027s your age, Catherine, and Colin\u0027s much too old for her. Why, he\u0027s almost twice her age.\" Alison and Jennifer rushed forward to hug Alesandra, too. All three sisters clung to her and it was all Alesandra could do to keep her balance. They were all talking at once, of course. It was chaotic, and a little overwhelming for Alesandra. There wasn\u0027t room for Marian Rose. She hung back, but not for long. She stomped her foot in a bid to get attention, and when that didn\u0027t work, she let out a bloodcurdling scream. Everyone immediately turned to see what was wrong, and Marian Rose used that opportunity to hurl herself at Alesandra. Raymond and Stefan heard the scream and came running. Gweneth apologized for her daughter\u0027s behavior, told Marian Rose to hush, and then put the guards to work carrying up the extra crates of wineglasses from the cellar. Raymond motioned to Alesandra. She excused herself from Colin\u0027s family and went over to him. \"The duchess keeps opening the French doors, Princess. We keep closing them. It isn\u0027t safe to have the back of the house unlocked. Could you please talk to her? Colin\u0027s going to be furious when he gets here and sees all the doors and windows open.\" \"I\u0027ll try to talk to her,\" Alesandra promised. \"I doubt she\u0027ll listen. I guess we\u0027re going to have to have faith it will all go well. Just a few more hours and the worry will be over.\" Raymond bowed to the princess. He wasn\u0027t about to sit back and hope things would go well. Both he and Stefan were ready to pull their hair out over the number of strangers stomping into the town house with flowers and trays and gifts. It had been almost impossible to keep count of who everyone was. Raymond went into the kitchen. He grabbed hold of a servant and ordered him to take a message to Colin. The duchess wouldn\u0027t listen to a guard, but she would certainly listen to her son. Raymond didn\u0027t stop there. He went upstairs next to look for the Duke of Williamshire and alert him to the possible danger. The time got away from Alesandra. Millicent Norton and her assistants came downstairs and waylaid her just as she was about to go up. The dressmaker explained that the wedding gown was hanging in front of the wardrobe in Alesandra\u0027s bedroom and that it was without a doubt the most exquisite dress she\u0027d ever created. Alesandra was in full agreement. She spent a long while complimenting the dressmaker and longer still promising to take every care when she put on the delicate gown. Gweneth came rushing into the foyer just as Millicent and her assistants left. \"Good heavens, Alesandra. It\u0027s already three and you haven\u0027t begun to get ready. Have you had your bath yet?\" \"Yes, Aunt.\" \"The girls are getting ready now,\" Gweneth told her. She took hold of Alesandra\u0027s hand and started up the steps. \"Janet will be in to help you just as soon as she finishes braiding Marian Rose\u0027s hair. Is your stomach full of butterflies, Alesandra? I know you must be excited. You mustn\u0027t worry though. Everything\u0027s ready. It\u0027s going to be a beautiful wedding. Hurry now or you\u0027ll miss it.\" The duchess laughed over her own jest. She gave Alesandra\u0027s hand an affectionate squeeze when she reached her bed chamber, then opened the door and went inside. Alesandra could hear Marian Rose begging the maid to let her hair loose and then Gweneth\u0027s command to sit still. Alesandra\u0027s bedroom was the last along the corridor. She opened the door and went inside. She was in such a hurry now, she didn\u0027t pay attention to anything but getting out of her dress. The buttons were in the front, and she had them undone before she\u0027d even pushed the door shut behind her. She stripped out of her clothes, washed from top to bottom again, and then put on her white cotton robe. She was just securing the belt around her waist when the door opened behind her. Alesandra assumed it was the maid coming in to assist her. She started to turn around, but was suddenly grabbed from behind. A hand clamped down over her mouth to silence the instinctive scream already gathering in her throat. She heard the sound of the door being bolted and knew then that there were at least two men in the room with her. It took all of her determination to remain calm. She forced herself not to struggle. She was terrified inside, but she wasn\u0027t going to let that interfere with her ability to think. She could become hysterical later, after she\u0027d gotten away from the horrible men. She would have to be patient, she told herself, and wait for her opportunity to get free. She wouldn\u0027t scream, no matter how strong the urge became. Colin\u0027s sisters would come running and, dear God, she didn\u0027t want any of them to get hurt.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/castles-crown-s-spies-4/page-20.html","bookId":1789,"book":{"id":1789,"title":"Castles (Crown\u0027s Spies #4)","description":"Storyline: Orphaned and besieged Princess Alesandra knew that only hasty marriage to an Englishman could protect her from the turmoil in her own land.
