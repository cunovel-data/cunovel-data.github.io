{"id":78336,"no":36,"title":"Page 36","content":"\"I dropped Sara at her mother\u0027s so she could show off the baby.\"\n \"Are you staying with her family while you\u0027re in London?\" Caine asked.\n \"Hell, no,\" Nathan answered. There was a true shudder in his voice. \"They would drive me daft and I\u0027d probably kill one of them. We\u0027re staying with you.\"\n Caine nodded. He smiled, too. How like Nathan to instruct instead of ask. Jade clasped her hands together with joy. She was obviously thrilled with the news.\n \"Where is your wife?\" Nathan asked Colin.\n \"Flannaghan went upstairs to get her. She\u0027ll be down in a minute.\"\n One minute turned into ten. Alesandra had already taken off her ink-stained gown and put on a pretty violet-colored dress. She was sitting at her writing table, absorbed in her fanciful task of making a list of duties for Colin. She would never show the list to her husband, of course, because none of the orders were appropriate. Wives, she was learning, did better to suggest to their husbands. Most, including Colin, didn\u0027t like being ordered to do anything.\n Still, it was quite all right to pretend, and it did make her feel better to write down her expectations. She put Colin\u0027s name at the top of the paper. The list of orders followed.\n First, he should listen to his wife explain her concerns about the alarming coincidences involving Victoria and a man who called himself a secret admirer. In brackets she wrote Catherine\u0027s name.\n Second, Colin should do something about his attitude toward her inheritance. In brackets she added the words too stubborn.\n Third, Colin shouldn\u0027t wait five years to realize he loved her. He should realize it now, and tell her so.\n Fourth, he should try to be happy he was going to become a father. He shouldn\u0027t blame her for interfering with his schedule.\n Alesandra read over her list and let out a loud sigh. She was so thrilled she was going to have Colin\u0027s baby and so afraid he would be unhappy, she wanted to weep and shout at the same time.\n She let out a long sigh. It wasn\u0027t like her to be so disorganized or so emotional.\n She added a question to her list: \"Can pregnant wives become nuns?\"\n She wasn\u0027t quite finished and added one more sentence: \"Mother Superior loves me.\"\n There—that important reminder made her feel a little better. She nodded, calmer now, and lifted the sheet of paper in her hands with the intent of tearing it up.\n Flannaghan interrupted her. He knocked on her door and when she bid him enter he rushed inside.\n He was relieved to see his princess had quit weeping. Her eyes still looked a bit swollen, but he didn\u0027t mention her condition and neither did she.\"\n \"Princess, we have…\"\n She didn\u0027t let him finish. \"Pray forgive me for interrupting, but I don\u0027t want to forget my question to you. Has Cook been able to talk to anyone in the viscount\u0027s household yet? I know I\u0027ve been pestering you with this matter and I do apologize, but I have sound reasons for wanting to know my answers, Flannaghan. Please be patient with me.\"\n \"She still hasn\u0027t run into any of the staff at market,\" Flannaghan replied. \"May I offer a suggestion?\"\n \"Yes, of course.\"\n \"Why not send her over to the viscount\u0027s town house? If she goes to the back door, the viscount won\u0027t know she called. I don\u0027t believe the staff would mention it to him.\"\n She immediately nodded agreement. \"That\u0027s a fine idea,\" she said in praise. \"This is too important to put off any longer. Please ask Cook to go now. She can use our carriage.\"\n \"Oh, no, Princess, she wouldn\u0027t wish to ride in the carriage. It wouldn\u0027t be proper. The viscount\u0027s residence is just a stone\u0027s throw away,\" he exaggerated. \"She\u0027ll enjoy the brisk walk.\"\n \"If you\u0027re certain,\" Alesandra replied. \"Now what was it you wanted to speak to be about before I interrupted you?\"\n \"We have company,\" Flannaghan explained. \"Your husband\u0027s partner is here. Milord\u0027s brother and his wife are with him.\"\n She started to stand up, then changed her mind. \"Wait just a minute and I\u0027ll follow you down. I\u0027ve made a fresh list for you.\"\n Flannaghan smiled in anticipation. He\u0027d learned to love her lists, because in his heart he knew she cared about him enough to help him become organized. She always included little bits of praise along with her suggestions for tasks she believed he would wish to complete for the day. His princess was always most appreciative, too, and gracious with her compliments.\n He watched as she sorted through her pile. Alesandra finally found the sheet of paper with Flannaghan\u0027s name on it and handed it to him.\n He tucked the list in his pocket and escorted her down the stairs. He spotted the package on the table in the foyer and only then remembered he was supposed to give it to her.\n \"That box arrived a few minutes ago,\" he told her. \"Would you like to open it now or wait until later?\"\n \"Later, please,\" she answered. \"I\u0027m most curious to meet Colin\u0027s partner first.\"\n Colin was about to get up and go after his wife when she walked into the salon. The men immediately stood up. Alesandra went over to Jade, took hold of her hand, and told her how pleased she was to see her again.\n \"Damn, but you did all right, Colin.\"\n Nathan whispered that praise. Alesandra didn\u0027t hear his remark. She finally gained enough courage to walk over to the huge man and smile up at him.\n \"Do I bow my head to a princess?\" Nathan asked.\n \"If you do, I\u0027ll be able to kiss your cheek in appreciation. I\u0027ll need a ladder otherwise.\"\n Nathan laughed. He leaned down, received a kiss on his cheek, and then straightened up again. \"Now explain what you meant by appreciation,\" he ordered.\n Lord, he was a handsome devil. Terribly soft-spoken too. \"In appreciation for putting up with Colin, of course. I understand how your partnership works so well now. Colin\u0027s the stubborn one, and you\u0027re surely the peacemaker in the company.\"\n Colin threw back his head and laughed heartily. Nathan looked a little sheepish.\n \"You\u0027ve got it backwards, Alesandra,\" Caine explained. \"Nathan\u0027s the stubborn one and Colin\u0027s the peacemaker.\"\n \"She calls me a dragon,\" Colin announced.\n Alesandra frowned at her husband for giving away that secret, then walked over to sit on the settee next to him.\n \"Caine, quit glaring at your wife,\" Colin ordered.\n \"He\u0027s extremely upset with me,\" Jade explained. \"And that\u0027s ridiculous, of course. I didn\u0027t encourage the attraction.\"\n \"I never said you did,\" Caine argued.\n Jade turned to Colin. \"He threw out the flowers. Can you imagine?\"\n Colin shrugged. He put his arm around Alesandra\u0027s shoulders and stretched out his legs in front of him. \"I haven\u0027t the faintest idea what you\u0027re talking about.\"\n \"You had better get this argument settled before I bring Sara and Joanna into your home. Daughters need a peaceful environment.\"\n Nathan made that announcement. Caine and Colin turned to stare at him. They both looked incredulous. Nathan ignored them.\n \"Were you pleased when you found out you were going to become a father?\" Alesandra tried to sound very nonchalant when she asked Nathan that question. She gripped her hands together in her lap.\n If Nathan thought her question odd, he didn\u0027t remark on it. \"Yes, I was very pleased.\"\n \"But what about your five-year schedule?\" Alesandra asked.\n \"What about it?\" Nathan countered, his confusion obvious.\n \"Didn\u0027t the baby interfere with your company plans?\"\n \"No.\"\n She didn\u0027t believe him. Nathan never would have sold company stock if it weren\u0027t for the baby. Colin had told her he wanted to purchase a home for his family.\n She wasn\u0027t about to bring up that tender topic, however. \"I see,\" she said. \"You made allowances for such an eventuality in your schedule.\"\n \"Colin, what is your wife talking about?\"\n \"When I first met Alesandra, I explained I wasn\u0027t going to get married for five years.\"\n \"Or have a family,\" she interjected with a nod.\n \"Or have a family,\" he repeated just to please her.\n Caine and Jade shared a look. \"How organized of you,\" Caine told his brother.\n Alesandra believed Colin\u0027s brother had just given a compliment. \"Yes, he is very organized,\" she enthusiastically agreed.\n \"Plans have a way of changing,\" Jade said. She was looking at Alesandra when she made that remark. Her expression was filled with sympathy. Alesandra was suddenly looking quite miserable. Jade believed she knew why.\n \"A baby is a blessing,\" she blurted out.\n \"Yes,\" Nathan agreed. \"Jade\u0027s correct, too, when she says plans have a way of changing,\" he added with a nod. \"Colin and I were counting on my wife\u0027s inheritance from the king to strengthen the company funds, but the prince regent decided to keep the money and we had to turn our minds to finding other solutions.\"\n \"Hence the five-year schedule,\" Colin explained.\n Alesandra looked like she was about to burst into tears. Caine felt like throttling his brother. If Colin would only look at her face, he would know something was terribly wrong. His brother obviously didn\u0027t have a clue, however, and Caine didn\u0027t believe he should interfere… yet.\n Alesandra was caught up in her own thoughts. She could feel herself getting angry over Nathan\u0027s casually given remark. He had made it quite clear that neither he nor Colin had any qualms about using Sara\u0027s inheritance. Why, then, was Colin so stubbornly resistant to using some of hers?\n Colin drew her attention when he spoke again. \"Caine, will you quit scowling at your wife.\"\n \"He blames me,\" Jade announced.\n \"I do not blame you,\" Caine argued.\n \"Blames you for what?\" Colin asked.\n \"I received a bundle of flowers this morning. There wasn\u0027t a note, just a signature.\"\n Nathan and Colin frowned in unison.\n \"You received flowers from another man?\" Nathan asked, his astonishment clear.\n \"Yes.\"\n Nathan turned to glare at his brother-in-law. \"You damn well better do something about this, Caine. She\u0027s your wife. You can\u0027t allow another man to send her flowers. Why the hell haven\u0027t you killed the bastard?\"\n Caine was thankful Nathan had taken his side. \"I\u0027m damn well going to kill him just as soon as I find out who he is.\"\n Colin shook his head. \"You can\u0027t kill anyone,\" he announced in exasperation. \"You\u0027re going to have to be reasonable about this, Caine. Sending flowers isn\u0027t a crime. He\u0027s probably just some young pup caught up in an infatuation.\"\n \"It\u0027s fine for you to be reasonable, Colin. Jade isn\u0027t your wife.\"\n \"I would still be reasonable if the flowers had been sent to Alesandra,\" Colin argued.\n Caine shook his head.\n \"Tell us his name, Jade,\" Nathan demanded.\n No one was paying any attention to Alesandra. She was thankful for their inattention. Her mind raced with speculations. She\u0027d shaken her head when Colin had guessed it was just a young man caught up in an infatuation.\n \"Yes,\" Colin asked Jade then. \"Who sent them?\"\n \"He signs all his cards Your Secret Admirer,\" said Alesandra.\n Everyone turned in unison to stare at her. Jade\u0027s mouth dropped open.\n \"Isn\u0027t that right, Jade?\"\n Her sister-in-law nodded. \"How did you know?\"\n Nathan leaned back in his chair. \"There\u0027s more to this than admiration, isn\u0027t there?\"\n No one said a word for a long minute. Alesandra suddenly remembered the package Flannaghan had told her had been delivered. She tried to go and get it. Colin wouldn\u0027t let her move. He tightened his hold on her shoulder.\n \"I believe the man might have sent something to me,\" she explained. \"There\u0027s a package in the foyer.\"\n \"The hell he did. Flannaghan!\"\n Colin roared the summons. Alesandra\u0027s ears started ringing. Flannaghan came running. He had the package in his hands, indicating he\u0027d been listening to the conversation. He all but tossed the thing to Colin.\n Alesandra reached for the package. Colin\u0027s glare changed her mind. She leaned back against the settee and folded her hands. Colin leaned forward to attack the box. He ripped the bow off, muttering under his breath, then tore the lid free and looked inside. Alesandra peeked around her husband\u0027s shoulder to see what was there. She got a glimpse of the ornately painted fan before Colin slammed the lid back down on the box.\n \"Son of a bitch!\" Colin roared. He repeated the shameful blasphemy a second time. Nathan, Alesandra noticed, nodded each time the foul words were said. Apparently those were his sentiments as well.\n Colin held the notecard in his hand and glared at it.\n \"Aren\u0027t you going to be reasonable about this?\" Caine challenged.\n \"Hell, no.\"\n \"Exactly,\" Caine muttered.\n \"One more and you\u0027ll have enough for a lynch mob,\" Jade announced. \"Will you look at our husbands, Alesandra? They\u0027re blowing this all out of proportion. Such jealousy is unfounded,\" she added.\n She expected Alesandra\u0027s agreement and was therefore surprised when her sister-in-law shook her head.\n \"Colin and Caine shouldn\u0027t be jealous,\" Alesandra whispered. \"But they should be worried.\"\n \"How did you know what was signed on the card?\" Nathan asked. \"Have you received other gifts?\"\n Colin turned to look at her. His expression was chilling. So was his tone of voice when he said, \"You would have told me if you\u0027d received any other gifts. Isn\u0027t that right, Alesandra?\"\n She was thankful she could agree with him. Colin\u0027s fury was actually a little frightening. \"Yes, I would have told you, and no, I haven\u0027t received any other gifts.\"\n Colin nodded. He leaned back, put his arm around her shoulders again, and hauled her up tight against his side. She found his possessiveness a comfort now and didn\u0027t mind at all that he was inadvertently squeezing the breath right out of her.\n \"You know more than you\u0027re telling,\" Nathan announced.\n Alesandra nodded. \"Yes,\" she answered. \"And I\u0027ve been trying to get someone to listen to me for a good long while. I even asked Sir Richards for help.\"\n She turned to frown at her husband. \"Are you ready to hear what I have to say?\"\n Colin was a bit surprised by his wife\u0027s comments, of course, but he was astonished by her angry tone of voice. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/castles-crown-s-spies-4/page-36.html","bookId":1789,"book":{"id":1789,"title":"Castles (Crown\u0027s Spies #4)","description":"Storyline: \n Orphaned and besieged Princess Alesandra knew that only hasty marriage to an Englishman could protect her from the turmoil in her own land.
