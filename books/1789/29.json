And yet, when he felt her tighten around him even more, heard her cry out his name, and knew then she was finding her own release, he thrust deep one last time and let out a low grunt of acceptance as he poured his seed into her.\n He thought he had died. And gone to paradise. He collapsed against her, took a long gulp of air, and groaned again. He was so damned satisfied, he felt like smiling. He couldn\u0027t, though. He didn\u0027t have the strength.\n It took Alesandra long minutes to recover. She felt safe and warm held so tenderly in her husband\u0027s arms. The terror she\u0027d felt seconds before subsided with each ragged breath Colin took.\n \"Damn, you\u0027re good,\" he said and rolled onto his back. The man wasn\u0027t much for flowery speech, Alesandra thought with a smile. It didn\u0027t matter. She was arrogantly proud of herself because she\u0027d pleased him. Perhaps she should give him a little praise too. She rolled onto her side to face him, put her hand on his chest directly over his pounding heart, and whispered, \"You\u0027re good, too. \u0027Tis the truth, you\u0027re the best I\u0027ve ever had.\"\n He opened his eyes to look at her. \"I\u0027m the only one you\u0027ve ever had, remember?\" His voice was gruff with affection.\n \"I remember,\" she said.\n \"No other man is ever going to touch you, Alesandra. You\u0027re mine.\"\n She wasn\u0027t bothered by his possessiveness. In truth, she found comfort in his attitude, for it made her think he must care for her. She belonged to him now, and the thought of doing what she had just done with any other man repelled her. There was only one Colin, and he belonged to her.\n She rested the side of her face on his shoulder. \"I wouldn\u0027t want anyone but you.\"\n He liked hearing her fervent admission and leaned up to kiss the top of her forehead to let her know how pleased he was.\n Long minutes passed in silence. Alesandra thought about what had just happened to her and tried to make logical sense out of her behavior. It proved to be an impossible task, however, for her response to her husband was most illogical.\n \"Colin?\"\n \"Yes?\"\n \"When you touch me, my control seems to vanish. It felt as though my mind had become separated from my body. That doesn\u0027t make sense, does it?\"\n She didn\u0027t wait for his answer. \"It was frightening—overwhelming, too—but it was also… splendid.\"\n Colin smiled in the darkness. His wife sounded thoroughly confused—worried, too. \"It\u0027s supposed to feel good, sweetheart,\" he whispered.\n \"Mother Superior didn\u0027t mention that fact.\"\n \"No, I don\u0027t imagine she would,\" he countered.\n \"I would like to make sense out of this bizarre mating ritual,\" she announced.\n \"Why?\"\n \"So that I can understand,\" she replied. She leaned up to look at him. His eyes were closed and he looked very peaceful. She thought he was about to fall asleep. Alesandra decided to let the matter drop. She cuddled up against her husband and closed her eyes. Her mind wouldn\u0027t cooperate, however, and one question after another raced through her thoughts.\n \"Colin?\"\n He grunted his reply.\n \"Have you taken other women to your bed?\"\n He didn\u0027t immediately answer her. She nudged him in his side. He let out a sigh. \"Yes.\"\n \"Very many?\"\n He almost shrugged her off his shoulder. \"Depends on who\u0027s doing the counting.\"\n She disliked that answer intensely. Was it two others, or twenty? The thought of Colin being intimate with even one other woman made her stomach tighten. Her reaction wasn\u0027t at all reasonable. His past shouldn\u0027t concern her. It did, though. \"Was it lust or love that made you want them?\"\n \"Alesandra, why are you asking me all these questions?\" He sounded irritated now. Realizing that made her annoyed as well. She was feeling vulnerable, but her insensitive husband was too obtuse to understand.\n Her burst of anger vanished almost as soon as it appeared. How could Colin understand when she didn\u0027t understand herself? She wasn\u0027t being at all fair with him—or logical.\n \"I was just curious,\" she whispered. \"Did you love any of those women?\"\n \"No.\"\n \"Then it was lust?\"\n He sighed again. \"Yes.\"\n \"Was it lust with me?\"\n Or love, she\u0027d wanted to ask. She\u0027d been too afraid to add that word to her question, fearing the answer wouldn\u0027t be what she wanted to hear. Oh, God, she wasn\u0027t making any sense at all. She knew Colin didn\u0027t love her. Why then did she have this consuming need to hear him tell her so? What in heaven\u0027s name was the matter with her? Colin wanted to put an end to her inquisition. She was prodding him to answer questions he wasn\u0027t ready to think about. Hell, yes, it had been lust when he bedded her, he decided. From the moment he\u0027d first seen her, he\u0027d wanted her in his bed.\n Yet putting Alesandra into the same category with the other women he\u0027d bedded seemed an atrocity to him. Making love to her had been completely different, and much, much more fulfilling. No other woman had made him burn the way she did; no other woman had made him lose himself so completely.\n There was more than lust involved. Colin admitted that much to himself. He cared about Alesandra. She belonged to him now and it was a natural inclination for a husband to want to protect his wife.\n But love? Colin honestly didn\u0027t know if he loved her or not. He didn\u0027t have enough experience to draw upon to know what the hell love was anyway. His gut reaction to the nagging question was that he wasn\u0027t capable of letting himself love anyone with real intensity. He remembered the agony his friend and partner, Nathan, had gone through when he\u0027d fallen in love with his wife. Colin blanched over the mere possibility that he wasn\u0027t any stronger emotionally than Nathan was. He hadn\u0027t believed it was possible for such a tough-skinned giant to fall so hard. Nathan had, however. He\u0027d become damned vulnerable, too.\n Colin forced the dour thoughts aside and reached for his wife. She was trying to scoot over to the far side of the bed, away from him. He wasn\u0027t about to let her go. He pulled her into his arms, gently pushed her onto her back, and then covered her from head to toes with his body. He propped his weight with his arms and stared down at her. He frowned with concern when he saw the tears in her eyes. \"Did I hurt you again, sweetheart? When I\u0027m inside you I go a little crazy. I…\"\n His voice was gruff with emotion. She reached up to stroke the side of his face. \"I went a little crazy too,\" she confessed. \"You made me forget all about my tenderness.\"\n \"Then why are you upset?\"\n \"I\u0027m not. I was just trying to sort things out in my mind.\"\n \"Sort out things like love and lust?\"\n She nodded. He smiled. \"Sweetheart, I\u0027ve lusted after you for a long, long time. And you\u0027ve lusted after me,\" he added with a nod.\n He thought his admission would please her. She surprised him with a frown. \"Lust is a sin,\" she whispered. \"I will admit I found you very attractive, but I certainly didn\u0027t want you in my bed.\"\n \"And why the hell not?\"\n She couldn\u0027t believe he was getting pricked over her admission. The man\u0027s ego was involved, she supposed, and she\u0027d just inadvertently stomped on it.\n \"Because I didn\u0027t know what would happen there. No one told me how wonderful making love would be. Now do you understand?\"\n He grinned, looked sheepish.\n \"Do you know, Colin, I\u0027ve just worked it all out in my mind,\" she announced. \"I couldn\u0027t understand why I was feeling vulnerable but now I know the reason and I\u0027m feeling much better.\"\n \"Explain it to me,\" he ordered.\n \"It\u0027s because this intimacy is new to me, of course. I didn\u0027t have a clue it would be so magnificent, and I didn\u0027t realize I would become so emotionally involved.\" She paused to smile up at him. \"If I\u0027d had your experience, I probably wouldn\u0027t have felt vulnerable at all.\"\n \"It isn\u0027t a sin for a wife to feel vulnerable,\" he announced. \"It doesn\u0027t make any sense in your situation, however.\"\n \"Why doesn\u0027t it make sense?\"\n \"Because you certainly realize I\u0027m going to take care of you and you therefore have no reason to feel vulnerable at all.\"\n \"That\u0027s an extremely arrogant thing to say, husband.\"\n He shrugged. \"I\u0027m an arrogant man.\"\n \"Do husbands ever feel vulnerable?\"\n \"No.\"\n \"But, Colin, if…\"\n He didn\u0027t let her finish her argument. His mouth covered hers, cutting off all conversation. He thought only to take her mind off the bizarre topic, but she opened her mouth for his tongue and put her arms around his neck and he was suddenly caught up in a burst of passion he didn\u0027t feel like squelching.\n He made love to her again, tried to be gentle and take it slow and easy, but she waylaid his noble intentions by responding with abandon. Although it didn\u0027t seem possible to him, each time was better, even more fulfilling. His own cl**ax almost killed him, and when he felt her tears on his shoulder, he believed he\u0027d really hurt her.\n Colin lit the candles and turned back to her. He took her into his arms and soothed her with honeyed words. She promised him he hadn\u0027t injured her, but she couldn\u0027t explain why she\u0027d started crying.\n He didn\u0027t prod her into another conversation. Her lusty yawns told him she was exhausted. Odd, but he was wide awake now. The scare that he might have harmed her jarred him and he knew it would take more than just a few minutes to relax again. Her lists drew his attention when he turned to blow out the candles. On the top sheet were two names. Lady Victoria was first, followed by Lady Roberta. Alesandra had placed question marks after each name.\n Needless to say, his curiosity was caught. She was just drifting off to sleep when he nudged her.\n \"What is this all about?\"\n She didn\u0027t open her eyes. Colin read the names to her and asked her to explain.\n \"Can\u0027t we discuss this in the morning?\"\n He was about to give in to her request when she muttered, \"There might be a connection between the two women. Both have disappeared, after all. After I\u0027ve talked to Lady Roberta\u0027s husband, I\u0027ll explain everything to you. Good night, Colin.\"\n \"You are not going to talk to the viscount.\"\n The tone of his voice cut through her sleepy haze. \"I\u0027m not?\"\n \"No, you\u0027re not. The man has enough to deal with now. He doesn\u0027t need you grilling him with questions.\"\n \"Colin, I…\"\n He didn\u0027t let her finish. \"I forbid it, Alesandra. Give me your word you won\u0027t bother him.\"\n She was astonished by his high-handed attitude—angry, too. She wasn\u0027t a child who had to gain her parent\u0027s permission to pursue an interest or a worry, and Colin had best understand she had a mind of her own and could use it upon occasion.\n \"Promise me, Alesandra,\" he demanded again.\n \"No.\"\n He couldn\u0027t believe what he\u0027d just heard. \"No?\"\n Because her face was still tucked under his chin and he couldn\u0027t possibly see her expression, she felt it safe to grimace. Lord, he sounded surly. His arm tightened around her. A good wife probably would try to placate her husband, she supposed.\n She guessed she didn\u0027t have it in her to be a good wife, however, for no man—not even Colin—was going to direct her actions.\n Ask his permission indeed! She pushed herself away from him and sat up. Her hair covered half her face. She brushed it back over her shoulder and matched him glare for glare.\n \"Marriage is new to you, Colin, and so you will have to take my word when I tell you…\"\n \"Correct me if I\u0027m wrong, but haven\u0027t we been married the exact length of time?\"\n \"Yes…\"\n \"Then marriage is just as new to you too, isn\u0027t it?\"\n She nodded.\n \"New or old, Alesandra, the vows haven\u0027t changed. Wives obey their husbands.\"\n \"Ours is not a usual marriage,\" she countered. \"You and I settled upon an agreement of sorts before we spoke our vows. You\u0027ve obviously forgotten and for that reason I will not take exception to your outrageous command. I will remind you, however, that we both agreed not to hover.\"\n \"No we didn\u0027t.\"\n \"It was an unspoken promise we gave to each other. I told you I didn\u0027t want a husband who hovered and you admitted you didn\u0027t want a wife who hovered, either.\"\n \"What the hell does that have to do with…\"\n \"By hover I meant someone who interferes,\" she told him. \"You\u0027ve made it perfectly clear on several occasions that you don\u0027t wish my help or interference in your business affairs and I would now like to take this opportunity to insist you not interfere in my affairs.\"\n She couldn\u0027t quite look into his eyes. His incredulous expression made her nervous. She turned her gaze to his chin. \"My father would never have forbidden my mother anything. Their marriage was based upon a foundation of mutual trust and respect. In time I hope we can achieve the same kind of arrangement.\"\n \"Are you finished?\"\n She was pleased that he didn\u0027t sound angry with her. Colin was going to be reasonable about this after all. He had listened to what she had to say and hadn\u0027t allowed his arrogant nature to get in the way.\n \"Yes, thank you.\"\n \"Look at me.\"\n She immediately lifted her gaze to his eyes. He didn\u0027t say another word for a long minute. His stare made her worry, though. His expression didn\u0027t give her a hint of what he was thinking and his amazing ability to mask his thoughts and his feelings did impress her. She was a little envious, too. She wished she had that much control.\n \"Did you want to say something to me?\" she asked when she couldn\u0027t stand the silence a second longer.\n He nodded. She smiled.\n \"You will not talk to the viscount about his wife.\"\n They were right back where they\u0027d started. Colin obviously hadn\u0027t heard a word she\u0027d said. She felt like kicking the stubborn man. She didn\u0027t, of course, because she was a lady, and her impossible husband was never going to know how furious she was.\n God\u0027s truth, he could make Mother Superior curse in vexation.\n Colin forced himself not to smile. The issue was too important to turn into a laughing matter, but, dear God, her expression was priceless. She looked like she wanted to kill him.\n \"Give me your promise, wife.\"\n \"Oh, all right,\" she cried out. \"You win. I won\u0027t bother the viscount.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/castles-crown-s-spies-4/page-29.html","bookId":1789,"book":{"id":1789,"title":"Castles (Crown\u0027s Spies #4)","description":"Storyline: \n Orphaned and besieged Princess Alesandra knew that only hasty marriage to an Englishman could protect her from the turmoil in her own land.
