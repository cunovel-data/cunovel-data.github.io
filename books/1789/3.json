He would like your permission to repair it.\"\\n\\n \"Do you mean now?\" Flannaghan asked.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" she answered. \"Raymond\u0027s a worrier,\" she added. \"He won\u0027t rest until the house is secure.\"\\n\\n She didn\u0027t wait for the servant\u0027s permission but nodded to the guard, giving him her approval. Valena had already unpacked her mistress\u0027s sleeping gown and wrapper. Alesandra turned to help just as Valena let out a loud yawn.\\n\\n \"Valena, go and get your sleep. Tomorrow will be time enough to unpack the rest of my things.\"\\n\\n The maid bowed low to her mistress. Flannaghan hurried forward. He suggested the maid take the last room along the corridor. It was the smallest of the chambers, he explained, but the bed was quite comfortable and the room was really rather cozy. He was certain Valena would find it suitable. After bidding Alesandra good night, he escorted the maid down the hall to help get her settled.\\n\\n Alesandra fell asleep a scant thirty minutes later. As was her usual habit, she slept quite soundly for several hours, but promptly at two o\u0027clock in the morning she awakened. She hadn\u0027t been able to sleep a full night through since returning to England, and she\u0027d gotten used to the condition. She put on her robe, added another log to the fire, and then got back into bed with her satchel of papers. She would read her broker\u0027s report on the current financial status of Lloyd\u0027s of London first, and if that didn\u0027t make her sleepy, she\u0027d make a new chart of her own holdings.\\n\\n A loud commotion coming from below the stairs interrupted her concentration. She recognized Flannaghan\u0027s voice and assumed from the frantic edge to his tone that he was trying to soothe his employer\u0027s temper.\\n\\n Curiosity got the better of her. Alesandra put on her slippers, tightened the belt around her robe, and went to the landing. She stood in the darkness of the shadows, but the foyer below her was ablaze with candlelight. She let out a little sigh when she saw how Raymond and Stefan were blocking Colin\u0027s way. He was turned away from her, but Raymond happened to look up and spot her. She immediately motioned for him to leave. He nudged his companion back to his station, bowed to Colin, and then left the foyer.\\n\\n Flannaghan didn\u0027t notice the guards\u0027 departure. He didn\u0027t notice Alesandra either. He never would have gone on and on if he\u0027d known she was standing there listening to his every word.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s just what I imagined a real princess would be,\" he told his employer, his voice reeking with grating enthusiasm. \"She has hair the color of midnight, and it\u0027s full of soft curls that seem to float around her shoulders. Her eyes are blue, but a shade of blue I\u0027ve never seen before. They\u0027re so brilliant and clear. And you\u0027re certain to tower over her. Why even I find myself feeling like a giant, a bumbling one at that, when she\u0027s looking directly up at me. She has freckles, milord.\" Flannaghan paused long enough to take a breath. \"She\u0027s really wonderful.\"\\n\\n Colin wasn\u0027t paying much attention to the servant\u0027s remarks about the princess. He had been about to put his fist into one of the strangers blocking his way and then toss both men back into the street when Flannaghan had come running down the stairs to explain that the men came from the Duke of Williamshire. Colin had let go of the bigger of the two men and was now once again sorting through the stack of papers in his hands, looking for the report his partner had completed. He hoped to God he hadn\u0027t left the thing at the office, for he was determined to transfer the numbers into the ledgers before he went to bed.\\n\\n Colin was in a foul mood. He was actually a little disappointed that his butler had interfered. A good fistfight might have helped him get rid of some of his frustration.\\n\\n He finally found the missing sheet just as Flannaghan started in again.\\n\\n \"Princess Alesandra is on the thin side, yet I couldn\u0027t help but notice how shapely her figure is.\"\\n\\n \"Enough,\" Colin ordered, his voice soft, yet commanding.\\n\\n The servant immediately stopped his litany of Princess Alesandra\u0027s considerable attributes. His disappointment was apparent in his crestfallen expression. He\u0027d only just warmed to his topic and knew he could have gone on and on for at least another twenty minutes. Why, he hadn\u0027t even mentioned her smile yet, or the regal way she held herself…\\n\\n \"All right, Flannaghan,\" Colin began, interrupting his servant\u0027s thoughts. \"Let\u0027s try to get to the bottom of this. A princess just decided to take up residence with us? Is that correct?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, milord.\"\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"Why what, milord?\"\\n\\n Colin sighed. \"Why do you suppose…\"\\n\\n \"It isn\u0027t my place to suppose,\" Flannaghan interrupted.\\n\\n \"When has that ever stopped you?\"\\n\\n Flannaghan grinned. He acted as though he\u0027d just been given a compliment.\\n\\n Colin yawned. Lord, he was tired. He wasn\u0027t in the mood to put up with company tonight. He was exhausted from too many long hours working on the company books, frustrated because he couldn\u0027t make the damn numbers add up to enough of a profit and extremely weary fighting all the competition. It seemed to him that every other day a new shipping company opened its doors for business.\\n\\n Added to his financial worries were his own aches and pains. His left leg, injured in a sea mishap several years ago, was throbbing painfully now, and all he wanted to do was get into his bed with a hot brandy.\\n\\n He wasn\u0027t going to give in to his fatigue. There was still work to be done before he went to bed. He tossed Flannaghan his cloak, placed his cane in the umbrella stand, and put the papers he\u0027d been carrying on the side table.\\n\\n \"Milord, would you like me to fetch you something to drink?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll have a brandy in the study,\" he replied. \"Why are you calling me your lord? You\u0027ve been given permission to call me Colin.\"\\n\\n \"But that was before.\"\\n\\n \"Before what?\"\\n\\n \"Before we had a real princess living with us,\" Flannaghan explained. \"It wouldn\u0027t be proper for me to call you Colin now. Would you prefer I call you Sir Hallbrook?\" he asked, using Colin\u0027s knighted title.\\n\\n \"I would prefer Colin.\"\\n\\n \"But I have explained, milord, it simply won\u0027t do.\"\\n\\n Colin laughed. Flannaghan had sounded pompous. He was acting more and more like his brother\u0027s butler, Sterns, and Colin really shouldn\u0027t have been at all surprised. Sterns was Flannaghan\u0027s uncle and had installed the young man in Colin\u0027s household to begin his seasoning.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re becoming as arrogant as your uncle,\" Colin remarked.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s good of you to say so, milord.\"\\n\\n Colin laughed again. Then he shook his head at his servant. \"Let\u0027s get back to the princess, shall we? Why is she here?\"\\n\\n \"She didn\u0027t confide in me,\" Flannaghan explained. \"And I thought it would be improper for me to ask.\"\\n\\n \"So you just let her in?\"\\n\\n \"She arrived with a note from your father.\"\\n\\n They had finally gotten to the end of the maze. \"Where is this note?\"\\n\\n \"I put it in the salon… or was it the dining room?\"\\n\\n \"Go and find the thing,\" Colin ordered. \"Perhaps his note will explain why the woman has two thugs with her.\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027re her guards, milord,\" Flannaghan explained, his tone defensive. \"Your father sent them with her,\" he added with a nod. \"And a princess would not travel with thugs.\"\\n\\n The expression on Flannaghan\u0027s face was almost comical in his awe of the woman. The princess had certainly dazzled the impressionable servant.\\n\\n The butler went running into the salon in search of the note. Colin blew out the candles on the table, picked up his papers, and then turned to the steps.\\n\\n He finally understood the reason for Princess Alesandra\u0027s arrival. His father was behind the scheme of course. His matchmaking attempts were becoming more outrageous, and Colin wasn\u0027t in the mood to put up with yet another one of his games.\\n\\n He was halfway up the steps before he spotted her. The banister saved him from disgrace. Colin was certain he would have fallen backward if he hadn\u0027t had a firm grasp on the railing.\\n\\n Flannaghan hadn\u0027t exaggerated. She did look like a princess. A beautiful one. Her hair floated around her shoulders and it really did look as dark as midnight. She was dressed in white, and, Lord, at first sight, she appeared to be a vision the gods had sent to test his determination.\\n\\n He failed the test. Although he gave it his best effort, he was still powerless to control his own physical reaction to her.\\n\\n His father had certainly outdone himself this time. Colin would have to remember to compliment him on his latest choice—after he\u0027d sent her packing, of course.\\n\\n They stood staring at each other for a long minute. She kept waiting for him to speak to her. He kept waiting for her to explain her presence to him.\\n\\n Alesandra was the first to give in. She moved forward until she stood close to the top step, bowed her head, and then said, \"Good evening, Colin. It\u0027s good to see you again.\"\\n\\n Her voice was wonderfully appealing. Colin tried to concentrate on what she had just said. It was ridiculously difficult.\\n\\n \"Again?\" he asked. Lord, he sounded gruff.\\n\\n \"Yes, we met when I was just a little girl. You called me a brat.\"\\n\\n That remark forced a reluctant smile from him. He had no memory of the encounter, however. \"And were you a brat?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, yes,\" she answered. \"I\u0027m told I kicked you—several times, in fact—but that was a very long time ago. I\u0027ve grown up since then and I don\u0027t believe the nickname is appropriate now. I haven\u0027t kicked anyone in years.\"\\n\\n Colin leaned against the banister so that he could take some of the weight off his injured leg. \"Where did we meet?\"\\n\\n \"At your father\u0027s home in the country,\" she explained. \"My parents and I were visiting and you were home from Oxford at the time. Your brother had just graduated.\"\\n\\n Colin still didn\u0027t remember her. That didn\u0027t surprise him. His parents were always entertaining houseguests and he\u0027d barely paid any attention to any of them. Most, he recalled, were down on their luck, and his father, kindhearted to a fault, took anyone begging assistance into his home.\\n\\n Her hands were demurely folded together and she appeared to be very relaxed. Yet Colin noticed how white her fingers were and knew she was actually gripping them together in either fear or nervousness. She wasn\u0027t quite as serene as she would have him believe. Her vulnerability was suddenly very apparent to him, and he found himself trying to find a way to put her at ease.\\n\\n \"Where are your parents now?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"My father died when I was eleven years old,\" she answered. \"Mother died the following summer. Sir, would you like me to help you collect your papers?\" she added in a rush, hoping to change the subject.\\n\\n \"What papers?\"\\n\\n Her smile was enchanting. \"The ones you dropped.\"\\n\\n He looked down and saw his papers lining the steps. He felt like a complete idiot standing there with his hand grasping air. He grinned over his own preoccupation. He really wasn\u0027t any better than his butler, he thought to himself, and Flannaghan had an acceptable excuse for his besotted behavior. He was young, inexperienced, and simply didn\u0027t know better.\\n\\n Colin should have known better, however. He was much older than his servant, in both years and experience. But he was overly weary tonight, he reminded himself, and surely that was the reason he was acting like a simpleton.\\n\\n Besides, she was one hell of a beauty. He let out a sigh. \"I\u0027ll get the papers later,\" he told her. \"Exactly why are you here, Princess Alesandra?\" he asked bluntly.\\n\\n \"Your brother and his wife are both ill,\" she explained. \"I was to stay with them while in the city, but at the last minute they became indisposed and I was told to stay with you until they are feeling better.\"\\n\\n \"Who gave you these instructions?\"\\n\\n \"Your father.\"\\n\\n \"Why would he take such an interest?\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s my guardian, Colin.\"\\n\\n He couldn\u0027t contain his surprise over that little bit of news. His father had never mentioned a ward to him, although Colin guessed it wasn\u0027t any of his affair. His father held his own counsel and rarely confided in either one of his sons.\\n\\n \"Have you come to London for the season?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" she answered. \"Although I am looking forward to attending some of the parties and I do hope to see the sights.\"\\n\\n Colin\u0027s curiosity intensified. He took another step toward her.\\n\\n \"I really didn\u0027t want to cause you any inconvenience,\" she said. \"I suggested I rent my own town house or open your parents\u0027 London home, but your father simply wouldn\u0027t hear of it. He told me it wasn\u0027t done.\" She paused to sigh. \"I did try to convince him. \u0027Tis the truth I couldn\u0027t outargue him.\"\\n\\n Lord, she had a pretty smile. It was contagious too. He found himself smiling back. \"No one can outargue my father,\" he agreed. \"You still haven\u0027t explained why you\u0027re here,\" he reminded her.\\n\\n \"I haven\u0027t, have I? It\u0027s most complicated,\" she added with a nod. \"You see, it wasn\u0027t necessary for me to come to London before, but it is now.\"\\n\\n He shook his head at her. \"Half-given explanations make me crazed. I\u0027m blunt to a fault—a trait I picked up from my partner, or so I\u0027m told. I admire complete honesty because it\u0027s so rare, and for as long as you are a guest in my home, I would appreciate complete candor. Are we in agreement?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, of course.\"\\n\\n She was clutching her hands together again. He must have frightened her. He probably sounded like an ogre. God only knew he was suddenly feeling like one. He was sorry she was so obviously afraid of him, yet pleased, too, because he\u0027d gotten his way. She hadn\u0027t argued with him over his dictate, or tried to act coy. He absolutely detested coyness in a woman.\\n\\n He forced a mild tone of voice when he asked, \"Would you mind answering a few pertinent questions now?\"\\n\\n \"Certainly. What is it you wish to know?\"\\n\\n \"Why are there two guards with you? Now that you\u0027ve reached your destination, shouldn\u0027t they be dismissed? Or did you think I might withhold my hospitality?\"\\n\\n She answered the last of his question first. \"Oh, I never considered you would deny me lodging, sir. Your father assured me you would be most gracious to me. Flannaghan has his note for you to read,\" she added with a nod. \"Your father also insisted I retain my guards. Both Raymond and Stefan were hired by the mother superior of the convent where I used to live to travel with me to England, and your father insisted I keep them on. Neither guard has family back home to miss, and both are very well paid. You really shouldn\u0027t worry about them.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/castles-crown-s-spies-4/page-3.html","bookId":1789,"book":{"id":1789,"title":"Castles (Crown\u0027s Spies #4)","description":"Storyline: Orphaned and besieged Princess Alesandra knew that only hasty marriage to an Englishman could protect her from the turmoil in her own land.
