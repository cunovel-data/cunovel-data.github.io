{"id":78334,"no":34,"title":"Page 34","content":"To the outside world, Colin appeared to be a man without a care in the world. He always wore a devil-may-care smile, and he was one of the most popular men in London. When he entered a room, he was immediately surrounded by friends. The women wouldn\u0027t be left out either. It didn\u0027t matter to most of the ladies that he was now married. They continued to flock to his side. Colin was a charmer, yes, but he wasn\u0027t a flirt. He usually had hold of Alesandra\u0027s hand while he went about the task of mixing business with pleasure. Colin wasn\u0027t just intelligent—he was clever, too. Most of the shipping deals were negotiated in the ballrooms. When she realized that fact, she didn\u0027t mind the late hours they kept every night.\\n\\n She did do quite a bit of napping, though. She and Colin attended parties almost every night for two full months, and she was so exhausted she was seized with attacks of nausea.\\n\\n She was looking forward to tonight\u0027s affair, however, because Colin\u0027s family was also going to be attending the Earl of Allenborough\u0027s bash. The duke and duchess were escorting their daughter Catherine, and Colin\u0027s brother, Caine, and his wife were also going to be there.\\n\\n The earl had rented Harrison House for the ball. The magnificent marble and stone estate was almost as large as the prince regent\u0027s palace.\\n\\n Alesandra wore her ivory-colored gown. The neckline wasn\u0027t overly revealing, but Colin still felt compelled to grumble about it. Her only adornment was a beautiful gold and sapphire necklace that fit like a choker around her neck. There was only one sapphire in the center of the looped chain. The precious jewel was at least two carats in size and appeared to be flawless. Colin knew the thing was worth a bloody fortune, and he didn\u0027t like the idea of Alesandra wearing it.\\n\\n \"I have a special fondness for this necklace,\" she remarked once they were settled inside the carriage and on their way to the ball. \"But I can tell from your frown you don\u0027t care for it. Why is that, Colin?\"\\n\\n \"Why do you like it?\"\\n\\n Her fingertips brushed the necklace. \"Because it belonged to my mother. Whenever I wear it, I\u0027m reminded of her. The necklace was a gift to her from my father.\"\\n\\n Colin\u0027s attitude immediately softened. \"Then you should wear it.\"\\n\\n \"But why did it displease you? I saw the way you frowned when you first noticed it.\"\\n\\n He shrugged. \"I was displeased because I didn\u0027t buy it for you.\"\\n\\n She didn\u0027t know what to make of that remark. She reached behind her neck and started to undo the clasp so she could take the necklace off. Colin stopped her. \"I was being foolish. Leave it. The color matches your eyes.\"\\n\\n From the look on her husband\u0027s face, she concluded he\u0027d just given her a compliment and not a criticism. She folded her hands in her lap, smiled at her husband, and changed the subject. \"Shouldn\u0027t your partner be home any day now?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"Will I like him?\"\\n\\n \"Eventually.\"\\n\\n \"Will I like his wife?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n She wasn\u0027t upset by his short answers. She could tell from his expression he was in pain. His leg was obviously acting up tonight, she speculated, and when Colin propped his foot up on the cushion next to her, she knew her guess was right.\\n\\n It took all the self-control she could muster not to reach over and touch his leg. \"We don\u0027t have to attend the affair tonight,\" she said. \"You look weary to me.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m fine.\" he said in a clipped, no-nonsense tone of voice. She decided not to argue with him.\\n\\n She changed the topic again. \"It\u0027s appropriate for us to give a gift to Nathan and Sara for their baby.\"\\n\\n Colin had leaned back against the seat and closed his eyes. She wasn\u0027t certain if he was paying attention to what she was saying or not. She lowered her gaze to her lap and began to adjust the folds of her gown. \"I didn\u0027t think you wanted to be bothered with the chore so I took care of it. Since you and Nathan own a shipping company, I thought it would be nice to have a replica of one of the ships made. What do you think of that idea? When they purchase a home, Sara could put our gift on her mantel.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure she\u0027ll like it,\" Colin replied. \"Whatever you decide is fine with me.\"\\n\\n \"There were several drawings of your ships in your library,\" she said then. \"I hope you don\u0027t mind that I borrowed one of the Emerald to give to the craftsman.\"\\n\\n The carriage came to a quick stop in front of Harrison House. Colin had looked half asleep until the door was opened by the coachman. Then his manner changed. He helped Alesandra out, took hold of her arm, and started up the steps. He spotted his brother and his wife walking toward them and immediately smiled.\\n\\n Colin hadn\u0027t made a miraculous recovery. His smile was forced, but Alesandra knew she was the only one who realized how much pain he was in. The physician had told her that Colin should get off his leg when it pained him. Her husband wouldn\u0027t listen to such advice, however. He would probably dance the night away just to prove he was all right.\\n\\n The night air was damp and chilly. Alesandra suddenly felt a bit lightheaded. Her stomach turned queasy, too, and she was thankful she hadn\u0027t eaten much of the light supper Cook had prepared. Exhaustion was surely the reason she wasn\u0027t feeling well, she told herself.\\n\\n Jade noticed how pale Alesandra\u0027s complexion was and made that mention in front of their husbands. Both Caine and Colin turned to look at her.\\n\\n \"Why didn\u0027t you tell me you didn\u0027t feel well?\" Colin asked.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m just a little weary,\" she hastily replied. \"Do quit frowning at me, Colin. I\u0027m not accustomed to going out every night and that\u0027s why I\u0027m a bit fatigued. \u0027Tis the truth, I would rather stay home every now and then.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t like the parties?\"\\n\\n Her husband looked surprised. She lifted her shoulders in a shrug. \"We do what we must,\" she replied.\\n\\n \"Explain what you mean, sweetheart.\"\\n\\n He wasn\u0027t going to let the matter drop. \"All right then,\" she said. \"No, I don\u0027t particularly like the parties…\"\\n\\n \"Why didn\u0027t you say something?\"\\n\\n He was exasperated with her. She shook her head at him. \"Because each affair is a business opportunity for you and Nathan,\" she explained. \"You don\u0027t like going out either,\" she added. \"And that is why I said that we do what we must. I would have said something eventually.\"\\n\\n His wife was an extremely astute woman. She\u0027d understood his motives and known exactly how he\u0027d really felt about all the parties he dragged her to. \"Eventually?\" he repeated with a grin. \"When, exactly, would you have offered a complaint?\"\\n\\n \"I would never complain and you should apologize for even suggesting I would,\" she countered. \"Eventually would be exactly five years from now. Then I would mention my preference to stay home.\"\\n\\n Caine smiled at Alesandra and said, \"Be sure to thank your friend, Albert, for his advice regarding that investment. The stock has already increased threefold.\" She nodded.\\n\\n \"What investment?\" Colin asked. Caine answered. \"I mentioned I was interested in investment opportunities the last time I was over at your house, and Alesandra told me Albert had recommended shares in Campton Glass. It just went public.\"\\n\\n \"I thought you were investing in Kent\u0027s garment factory.\" Jade interjected.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m still considering it,\" Caine replied.\\n\\n Alesandra shook her head before she could stop herself. \"I don\u0027t believe that would be a wise investment, Caine. I do hope you\u0027ll give the matter careful consideration first.\"\\n\\n She could feel Colin\u0027s gaze on her but didn\u0027t turn to look at him. \"Albert was also interested in the garment factory. He had his broker, Dreyson, go and look at the place. Dreyson reported it was a fire trap and ill run. There are hundreds of women and children employed there and conditions are deplorable. Albert wasn\u0027t about to make the owner rich or get rich himself on such a venture. Why, he would be profiting from other people\u0027s misery—at least, that\u0027s what he told me in his last letter.\"\\n\\n Caine immediately agreed. The topic was dropped when they entered the foyer of Harrison House. The duke and duchess were waiting in a nearby alcove with Catherine and immediately motioned for Caine and Colin and their wives to join them. Business matters were put aside. Catherine hugged Jade, then turned to hug Alesandra. She noticed the sapphire necklace right away and declared she was about to swoon with envy. Catherine wore a single strand of pearls around her neck. She absentmindedly fingered her necklace as she mentioned that her violet gown would look far more smashing if her father had given her a sapphire to wear.\\n\\n Alesandra laughed over the not-too-subtle hint. Since no one was observing them, she quickly took off her necklace and handed it to Catherine.\\n\\n \"This belonged to my mother, so you must be very careful with it,\" Alesandra whispered so Colin wouldn\u0027t overhear her. \"The clasp is quite secure and as long as you leave it on, you won\u0027t lose it.\"\\n\\n Catherine gave a halfhearted protest as she unclasped her own necklace and handed it to Alesandra. Jade held on to Catherine\u0027s dance card while her sister-in-law put on the necklace, then made her turn around so that she could make certain the clasp was secure.\\n\\n \"You be careful with this,\" she ordered her.\\n\\n Colin didn\u0027t notice the switch in jewelry for a good hour. Sir Richards came hurrying over to greet the family, and when Caine was occupied answering a question from his father, the director gave Colin the signal that he wanted to speak in private to him. The look on Richards\u0027s face indicated the matter was serious.\\n\\n The opportunity for a quick conference arose when Colin\u0027s father requested a dance with Alesandra. As soon as they walked toward the center of the ballroom, Colin went over to the director. Richards stood at the entrance of a. triangular alcove, watching the crowd.\\n\\n The two men stood side by side without speaking for several minutes. Colin noticed Neil Perry across the floor and immediately frowned with displeasure. He hoped Alesandra wouldn\u0027t notice the man. She was bound to try to comer him as soon as she spotted him and demand answers about his sister. Neil would turn insulting, of course, and Colin would probably have to smash his face in. That possibility made Colin smile. His sister drew his attention then. She was partnered with Morgan. Colin clasped his hands behind his back and watched the pair. Morgan spotted Colin and nodded to him. Colin nodded back.\\n\\n Sir Richards also nodded to the new recruit. He smiled, too. For that reason Colin was surprised by his angry tone of voice when he spoke. \"I shouldn\u0027t have given the assignment to Morgan,\" he whispered. \"He made a muck of it. Do you remember Devins?\"\\n\\n Colin nodded. The man Richards referred to was an agent who was occasionally used to transfer information for the government.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s dead now. From what I can sort out, he got caught in the middle of what turned into a bloody fight. Morgan said Devins panicked. They were waiting for their contact when Devins\u0027s daughter came along. It was a bad piece of luck. The girl was killed in the cross fire. Damn it all, Colin, it should have gone as smooth as ice, but Morgan\u0027s eagerness and inexperience turned a simple, uncomplicated mission into a fiasco. Bad luck or not, the man doesn\u0027t have the instincts for this line of work,\" he added with a nod. \"Don\u0027t use him again.\" Colin\u0027s voice shook with anger.\\n\\n \"Devins wasn\u0027t the type to panic. He had a temper, yes, but he could always be relied on to use sound judgment.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, under usual circumstances I would agree with your evaluation. However, he was also a protective father, Colin. I can imagine he did panic if he thought she was in danger.\"\\n\\n \"I would think a father would react in just the opposite manner. He had more reasons not to panic.\"\\n\\n Richards nodded. \"I\u0027ve told Morgan he\u0027s out. He felt bad about my decision, of course. He was sorry it went sour and admitted he\u0027d overreacted. He blamed you too, son, because you didn\u0027t go along and show him the ropes, so to speak.\"\\n\\n Colin shook his head. He wasn\u0027t buying that excuse. From the look on the director\u0027s face, he wasn\u0027t buying it either.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re right, Richards. He doesn\u0027t have the instincts.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a pity,\" the director remarked. \"He\u0027s eager to please and he needs the money. I imagine he\u0027ll marry well. He\u0027s quite a charmer with the ladies.\"\\n\\n Colin looked back at the dance floor. He found Morgan right away. He was smiling down at Catherine as he whirled her around the floor. His sister was laughing and obviously having the time of her life.\\n\\n Colin noticed the necklace Catherine was wearing then. He immediately turned to find Alesandra in the crowd. He spotted his father first, then saw Alesandra. She was now wearing Catherine\u0027s pearls. Colin frowned with concern. The switch in jewelry wasn\u0027t the cause, however. His wife\u0027s complexion had turned as white as her gown. She looked ready to faint.\\n\\n Colin excused himself from the director and went to his wife. He tapped his father on his shoulder and took Alesandra into his arms. She forced a smile and leaned into her husband\u0027s side.\\n\\n The waltz ended just as Colin turned to take his wife out on the front terrace.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re really ill, aren\u0027t you, sweetheart?\"\\n\\n Caine was standing with his wife next to the doors leading outside. He took one look at Alesandra\u0027s complexion and immediately backed up a step. His sister-in-law\u0027s face was turning green. He hoped to God whatever was ailing her wasn\u0027t the catching kind.\\n\\n Alesandra couldn\u0027t make up her mind whether she wanted to swoon or throw up. She prayed she wouldn\u0027t do either until she was home. The fresh air seemed to help, however, and after a minute or two, her head quit spinning.\\n\\n \"It was all that twirling around and around,\" she told her husband.\\n\\n Caine let out a loud sigh of relief and stepped forward to offer his assistance. Colin left Alesandra leaning against his brother while he said their good-byes, then came back to collect her. She hadn\u0027t worn a cloak, so he took off his jacket and put it around her shoulders on the way down the steps to their waiting carriage.\\n\\n Feeling better was short-lived. The rocking motion of the carriage made her stomach start acting up again. She gripped her hands together in her lap and took several deep breaths to calm herself.\\n\\n Colin reached over and hauled her onto his lap. He tucked her head under his chin and held her tight.\\n\\n He carried her inside the town house and up to her bedroom. He left her sitting on the side of the bed while he went to fetch a drink of cool water she\u0027d requested.\\n\\n Alesandra stretched out on top of the covers and closed her eyes. She was sound asleep a minute later. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/castles-crown-s-spies-4/page-34.html","bookId":1789,"book":{"id":1789,"title":"Castles (Crown\u0027s Spies #4)","description":"Storyline: Orphaned and besieged Princess Alesandra knew that only hasty marriage to an Englishman could protect her from the turmoil in her own land.
