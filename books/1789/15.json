{"id":78315,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"\"Where\u0027s your wife, Caine?\" Colin called over his shoulder. \"Upstairs with Mother,\" he answered. Alesandra was tugging on Colin\u0027s hand, trying to get loose. \"Why don\u0027t you just toss me on a chair and leave. You\u0027re obviously in a hurry to get rid of me.\" \"Which chair do you prefer?\" He finally let go of her. She took a step back and immediately bumped into Caine. She turned around, begged his forgiveness for her clumsiness, and then asked where his father was. She really wanted to speak to him as soon as possible, she explained. Because she was looking so serious and worried, Caine didn\u0027t dare smile. Princess Alesandra was a pretty thing, he thought to himself. Her eyes were a brilliant shade of blue and the freckles on the bridge of her nose reminded him of his wife, Jade. She was actually very beautiful, he realized. \"Jenkins went upstairs to tell my father you\u0027re here, Princess Alesandra. Why don\u0027t you make yourself comfortable while you wait?\" She thought that was a splendid idea. Caine had obviously been given all the manners in the family. He was very solicitous and polite. It was a nice change from his brother. Colin stood near the fireplace watching her. She ignored him. She hadn\u0027t paid any attention to the exterior of her guardian\u0027s town house, but she imagined it was just as grand as the interior. The salon was at least four times the size of Colin\u0027s. There were three settees placed in a half circle around the ivory-colored marble hearth. It was a lovely room filled with treasures the Duke of Williamshire had collected from around the world. Her gaze scanned the room, then came to rest on the gleaming object in the center of the mantel. She let out a gasp of pleasure. The replica in gold of her father\u0027s castle hadn\u0027t been misplaced after all. The reproduction of her childhood home was the size of a small brandy decanter and was exact in every detail to the real castle. The look of joy on Alesandra\u0027s face took Colin\u0027s breath away. \"Alesandra?\" he asked, wondering what had caused that reaction. She turned to smile at him. Then she hurried over to the mantel. Her hand trembled when she reached up and gently touched the side of one golden turret. \"This is a replica of my home, Colin. It\u0027s called Stone Haven. I lived there with my mother and father.\" \"I thought your father gave up his kingdom when he married your mother,\" Colin remarked. She nodded. \"Yes, he did. He purchased Stone Haven before he married her. The general can\u0027t touch it, either. It\u0027s located in Austria and he won\u0027t have any jurisdiction there, even if he is able to take over the throne. The castle will continue to be safe.\" \"Who owns it now?\" Caine asked. She didn\u0027t answer him. He assumed she hadn\u0027t heard his question. He was as intrigued by the castle as Colin appeared to be. The two brothers flanked Alesandra\u0027s sides as they stared at the reproduction. \"The detail is quite impressive,\" Caine remarked. \"My father gave it as a gift to your father,\" she explained. \"He was playing a bit of trickery—good-hearted, of course—and I looked for the castle when I was staying at his country home, but I couldn\u0027t find it. I thought it had been lost. It pleases me to see it has a place of honor.\" Colin was about to ask her what she\u0027d meant by her remark that trickery had been involved when they were interrupted. \"Of course it has a place of honor,\" the Duke of Williamshire called out from the entrance. \"Your father was my friend, Alesandra.\" She turned at the sound of her guardian\u0027s voice and smiled in greeting. The Duke of Williamshire was a distinguished-looking man with silver-tipped hair and dark gray eyes. The sons had gotten their good looks from him, of course, and their height as well. \"Good afternoon, Father,\" Colin called out. His father returned the greeting, then walked into the salon. He stopped in the center and opened his arms to Alesandra. She didn\u0027t hesitate. She ran to him and threw herself into his arms. He hugged her tight and kissed the top of her head. Colin and Caine shared a look of disbelief. They were astonished by their father\u0027s show of affection to his ward. The elderly man was usually very reserved, but he was treating Alesandra as though she were his long-lost daughter \"Has Colin been treating you well?\" \"Yes, Uncle Henry.\" \"Uncle Henry?\" Caine and Colin repeated the name at the same time. Alesandra pulled away from her guardian and turned to glare at Colin. \"Uncle Henry doesn\u0027t mind being related to me.\" \"But he isn\u0027t related to you,\" Colin stubbornly reminded her. His father smiled. \"I\u0027ve asked her to call me Uncle,\" he explained. \"Alesandra\u0027s part of our family now, son.\" He turned to his ward then. \"Sit down and we\u0027ll talk about this marriage business.\" She hurried to do as he requested. She spotted her notecard on the floor and immediately went to fetch it. Colin waited until she was settled in the center of the brocaded settee and then went over and sat down next to her. His bulk crowded her into the corner. Alesandra nudged his hard thigh away so she could collect her skirts from underneath him. \"There are plenty of other seats available,\" she whispered so her Uncle Henry wouldn\u0027t hear her criticizing his son. \"Do sit somewhere else, Cousin.\" \"If you call me cousin one more time I swear I\u0027m going to throttle you,\" Colin threatened in a low growl. \"And quit squirming.\" \"You\u0027re crowding her, son. Move over.\" Colin didn\u0027t budge. His father frowned, then took his seat next to Caine on the larger settee facing Alesandra. \"How have you two been getting along?\" his father asked. \"Colin was sick all week,\" Alesandra announced. \"Am I moving in with you today, Uncle?\" \"No.\" Colin\u0027s denial was abrupt—harsh, too. His father frowned at his son before turning his gaze back to Alesandra. \"Would you like to move in here?\" he asked. \"I thought Colin wanted me to,\" she answered. Her confusion was apparent in her expression. \"It seemed an imposition, having to look out for me. He\u0027s been acting very irritable today. I believe the cause is anxiety.\" Colin rolled his eyes heavenward. \"Let\u0027s get back to the main topic,\" he muttered. His father ignored that command. \"Colin\u0027s anxious?\" he asked Alesandra. \"Yes, Uncle,\" she answered. She folded her hands together in her lap while she added, \"He\u0027s anxious to get rid of me. So you can understand my confusion, can\u0027t you? A few minutes ago he was ready to toss me on the settee and leave, and now he\u0027s telling you I should stay with him.\" \"That is a contradiction,\" Caine interjected. Colin leaned forward. He braced his elbows on his knees and stared at his father. \"I don\u0027t believe it\u0027s a good idea to have her move anywhere just now. There was an incident outside the Opera House,\" he added with a nod. Alesandra interrupted him by nudging him in his side. He turned back to look at her. \"You don\u0027t need to go into that,\" she whispered. \"You\u0027ll only worry him.\" \"He needs to be worried,\" Colin told her. \"If he\u0027s going to take over the responsibility of looking out for you, he\u0027ll have to understand what he\u0027s up against.\" Colin didn\u0027t give her time to argue with him, but turned back to his father. He quickly explained what had happened, added a few pertinent details he\u0027d gathered from his talk with Sir Richards, and ended with his opinion that the threats weren\u0027t going to stop until Alesandra was married. \"Or until the general has either won or lost his campaign for the throne,\" Caine interjected. \"Hell, that could take a year,\" Colin predicted with a scowl. \"Perhaps,\" his brother agreed. He turned to his father then and said, \"I think Colin\u0027s right. Alesandra should continue to stay with him. He\u0027s more experienced in these matters and it would be less dangerous for you and Mother.\" \"Nonsense,\" his father countered. \"I know a thing or two about protecting my family. I can handle any danger that comes my way. The gossip, however, is something we must address. Now that your mother and I are feeling fit again, Alesandra will have to move in with us. It isn\u0027t acceptable for an unattached man and woman to live together.\" \"It was the thing last week,\" Caine reminded his father. \"Because of our illness,\" his father replied. \"Surely people will understand.\" Colin was incredulous. He didn\u0027t know what to say to his father\u0027s naive belief. He turned to his brother for help in arguing his point against Alesandra moving and saw that Caine was just as incredulous. \"Have you heard any gossip?\" his father asked Caine, frowning now over that worry. Caine shook his head. Colin tried to hold on to his patience. \"Father, gossip isn\u0027t the important issue here,\" he said. \"You cannot equate the danger you would be placing your family in with a few whispered remarks. Of course people are talking. Alesandra and I don\u0027t care.\" \"I won\u0027t let you argue me out of my decision,\" his father stubbornly insisted. \"You insult me if you believe I can\u0027t look out for my ward. I\u0027ve taken care of a wife and six children all these years without a problem and I\u0027m not about to stop now.\" \"But no one has wanted to kidnap Mother or…\" Caine began. \"Enough,\" his father ordered. \"The topic is closed.\" He softened his tone when he added, \"Your mother was right when she said Alesandra should get married as soon as possible. That would put an end to all this nonsense.\" Colin looked at Caine. \"She has this damned list.\" \"I gave her that list, son.\" Colin didn\u0027t know what to say to that. \"A list of what?\" Caine asked. \"Must you explain to Caine?\" she whispered. Her cheeks were turning pink with embarrassment. \"He\u0027s already married.\" \"I know he\u0027s married,\" Colin replied with a grin. Caine pretended he hadn\u0027t heard Alesandra\u0027s protest. \"A list of what?\" he asked his brother again. \"Men,\" Colin answered. \"She and Father have made a list of suitable men to marry.\" Caine didn\u0027t show any outward reaction to that explanation. He could tell from Alesandra\u0027s expression she was uncomfortable with the topic they were discussing. He decided to try to make her feel more at ease. \"That sounds reasonable to me,\" he announced. \"Reasonable? It\u0027s barbaric,\" Colin told him. Caine couldn\u0027t suppress his grin. \"This isn\u0027t amusing,\" Colin snapped. \"No,\" Caine agreed. \"It isn\u0027t amusing.\" \"It\u0027s most serious, sir,\" Alesandra interjected with a nod. Caine sat up a little straighter. \"So the purpose of this meeting is to select a husband from the list? Have I got it straight in my mind?\" \"Yes,\" Alesandra answered. \"I wanted to interview the candidates last week, but Colin became ill and I was occupied nursing him back to health.\" \"You nursed him?\" Caine asked with a smile. She nodded. \"Night and day,\" she said. \"He needed me.\" Colin was exasperated. \"I did not need you.\" She took exception to his gruff tone of voice. She leaned back against the settee. \"You\u0027re a very unappreciative man,\" she whispered. Colin ignored her remark. He nodded to Caine. \"That reminds me,\" he said. \"I wanted to thank you for your help. The ledgers haven\u0027t looked so organized in over a year.\" \"What ledgers?\" \"The shipping ledgers,\" Colin explained. \"I appreciated your help.\" Caine shook his head. Alesandra nudged Colin to get his attention. \"Couldn\u0027t we get back to the topic at hand? I would like to get this settled as soon as possible.\" \"I didn\u0027t touch your ledgers,\" Caine told his brother. \"Then who…?\" No one said a word for a long minute. Alesandra turned her attention to straightening the folds in her gown. Colin slowly turned to look at her. \"Did you hire Dreyson or someone else to work on my books?\" \"Of course not. Your books are private. I wouldn\u0027t let an outsider look at them. Besides, no one was admitted while you were sick.\" \"Then who the hell did the work?\" \"I did.\" He shook his head. She nodded. \"Don\u0027t jest with me, Alesandra. I\u0027m not in the mood for it.\" \"I\u0027m not jesting. I did do the work. I organized all of your logs, too, and filed them away.\" \"Who helped you?\" She was highly insulted by that question. \"No one helped me. I\u0027m very good with figures,\" she told him. \"You have my permission to write to Mother Superior if you don\u0027t believe me. I made a second set of books for her so the banker would give her… Oh, dear, I probably shouldn\u0027t have mentioned that. Mother Superior called it a sin, but I didn\u0027t believe it was. It wasn\u0027t larceny, either. I only changed the numbers so she could get the loan.\" Colin had an astonished expression on his face. She guessed he found her confession shameful. She quit trying to explain herself and took a deep breath. \"As for your ledgers,\" she continued. \"Transferring numbers and totaling your columns didn\u0027t require special training. It wasn\u0027t difficult, just tedius.\" \"And the percentages?\" Colin asked, still not certain he believed her. She shrugged. \"Anyone with half a mind could figure out percentages.\" He shook his head. \"But you\u0027re a woman…\" He was going to add that he couldn\u0027t imagine where she\u0027d gotten the training for book work, but she wouldn\u0027t let him finish. \"I knew that would come up,\" she cried out. \"Just because I\u0027m a woman, you assume I couldn\u0027t possibly understand anything but the latest fashions, isn\u0027t that right? Well, sir, you\u0027re in for a surprise. I don\u0027t give a twit about fashions.\" Colin had never seen her this riled. Her eyes had turned into blue fire. He thought he might like to strangle her. But he\u0027d kiss her first, he decided. Caine came to her rescue. \"And did the mother superior get her loan, Alesandra?\" \"Yes, she did,\" Alesandra answered, her voice tinged with pride. \"Mother didn\u0027t know the banker was looking at the second set of books, of course, or her vows would have forced her to confess. The nuns all follow very strict rules. She didn\u0027t find out until it was too late. She\u0027d already spent the money on a new chapel. So it all worked out quite nicely.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/castles-crown-s-spies-4/page-15.html","bookId":1789,"book":{"id":1789,"title":"Castles (Crown\u0027s Spies #4)","description":"Storyline: Orphaned and besieged Princess Alesandra knew that only hasty marriage to an Englishman could protect her from the turmoil in her own land.
