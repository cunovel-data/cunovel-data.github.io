{"id":78316,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"Colin let out a snort. \"I\u0027ll wager she was sorry to see you leave,\" he said dryly. \"Shall we get back to our reason for being here?\" Caine suggested. He stood up and walked over to Alesandra. \"May I have a look at your list, please?\" \"Yes, of course.\" Caine took the notecard and went back to his seat. \"It isn\u0027t complete,\" Alesandra explained. \"There are ten names on the list now, but if you want to add another one or two, please do so.\" \"I believe we should go ahead and start without Gweneth,\" her guardian announced. \"Caine, read the first name and we\u0027ll put the man under discussion.\" Caine unfolded the sheet of paper, scanned the contents, and then looked at his brother. \"Get started, son,\" his father insisted. \"The first name on the list is Colin,\" Caine announced, his gaze directed on his brother. \"Yes, but I\u0027ve scratched him off,\" Alesandra explained. \"Do you see the line through his name? Please go on to the names I haven\u0027t scratched through.\" \"Hold on,\" Caine said. \"I want to know why he was marked off, Alesandra. Did you put his name on the list or did my father suggest Colin?\" \"I gave her his name,\" his father answered. \"She hadn\u0027t even met Colin when we started the list. I believed it would be a sound match, but now I can see it wouldn\u0027t wash. They aren\u0027t suitable for each other.\" Caine was of the opposite opinion. The sparks flying between Alesandra and Colin were close to igniting, and each was desperately trying not to acknowledge the reason behind his or her frustration. \"How did you come to the conclusion they weren\u0027t suited?\" Caine asked his father. \"Just look at the two of them together, son. It\u0027s plain for anyone to see. Alesandra\u0027s looking terribly uncomfortable and Colin hasn\u0027t quit frowning since he sat down. It\u0027s apparent they don\u0027t get along. And that, you see, is an important ingredient for a sound marriage.\" \"Could we get on with it, Caine?\" asked Colin. \"Colin, do you have to be so irritable?\" Alesandra asked. He didn\u0027t answer her. She turned her attention to Caine. \"He\u0027s been ill,\" she reminded his brother, using that as her excuse for Colin\u0027s surly mood. \"It\u0027s this topic,\" his father interjected with a frown in Colin\u0027s direction. \"If Colin agreed to marry you, Alesandra, would you have him?\" Caine wanted to know. \"He has already declined,\" Alesandra explained. \"And he wouldn\u0027t be acceptable anyway.\" \"Why not?\" Caine asked. \"Will you let it go?\" Colin demanded. Caine ignored his brother\u0027s protest. So did Alesandra. She frowned while she thought about her answer. She didn\u0027t want to confuse Caine but she didn\u0027t want to have to go into a lengthy explanation either. \"He isn\u0027t acceptable because he wouldn\u0027t touch my inheritance.\" \"Damned right I wouldn\u0027t touch it.\" \"There, do you understand now?\" Caine didn\u0027t understand anything. The look on his brother\u0027s face told him not to prod further, however. Colin looked ready to grab somebody\u0027s throat and Caine didn\u0027t want to be his victim. \"Isn\u0027t there a better way to handle this situation?\" Caine asked then. \"Alesandra should be allowed to take her time…\" \"But there isn\u0027t time,\" his father interjected. \"I do thank you for your concern, Caine,\" Alesandra added. \"Go ahead, son. Read the second name on the list.\" Caine gave up. The second name had also been crossed through. Caine moved to the third name. \"Horton,\" he read. \"The Earl of Wheaton.\" \"I met him once,\" his father announced. \"He seemed like a decent chap to me.\" Caine was nodding agreement when Colin started shaking his head. \"What\u0027s wrong with him, Colin?\" his brother asked. \"He\u0027s a drunk. He won\u0027t do.\" \"He\u0027s a drunk?\" his father asked. \"I never realized that about Horton. Cross him off, Caine,\" he added with a scowl. \"I won\u0027t have her wed to a drunk.\" \"Thank you, Uncle Henry.\" Colin could feel himself getting ready to explode. It took all he had to keep his temper under control. In truth, he didn\u0027t understand why he was so agitated. He had made the decision not to marry Alesandra, but, damn it all, the thought of anyone else touching her didn\u0027t sit well with him. As though it were the most natural thing in the world to do, Colin leaned back against the cushions and put his arm around Alesandra\u0027s shoulders. She instinctively moved closer to him. He could feel her trembling, knew then she hated having to go through this ordeal as much as he did. Caine was right. There had to be a better way. His brother drew his attention when he read the next name. \"Kingsford, the Earl of Lockwood.\" \"Gweneth suggested Kingsford,\" his father announced. \"She was taken with his polite ways.\" Colin shook his head. \"He might be polite, but he\u0027s also got a reputation for his sadistic pleasures.\" \"Good God,\" his father muttered. \"Sadistic pleasures, you say? Mark him off, Caine.\" \"Yes, Father,\" Caine agreed. He read the next name. \"Williams, the Marquess of Coringham.\" \"I suggested him,\" his father explained. His voice reeked with fresh enthusiasm. \"He\u0027s a fine fellow. I\u0027ve known the family for years. Comes from good blood, Harry does.\" Caine was having difficulty maintaining his serious expression. Colin was already shaking his head. \"Harry\u0027s a womanizer,\" Colin announced. \"I never realized that about Harry,\" his father muttered. \"Gweneth and I need to get out more often. I\u0027d pick up on these things if we mingled more with society. All right, then, he won\u0027t do. We aren\u0027t marrying her to a future adulterer.\" Caine stared at Colin when he called out the next name on the list. \"Johnson, the Earl of Wentzhill.\" He hadn\u0027t gotten the man\u0027s full title out of his mouth before Colin started shaking his head. And so it continued. Colin found something wrong with every man mentioned. By the time Caine had gotten to the last name on the list, the Duke of Williamshire was slumped in the corner of the settee, his hand to his forehead, looking thoroughly defeated. Caine could barely contain his amusement. His brother was having difficulty coming up with a suitable vice after Caine had read the last name, Morgan Atkins, the Earl of Oakmount, and Caine was dying to hear what he had to say about him. \"I\u0027ve met Morgan,\" Alesandra announced. \"He came to Colin\u0027s house to discuss a business matter. He seemed very nice.\" Alesandra\u0027s voice lacked conviction. She was having trouble hiding her unhappiness now. She hated what was happening. She felt out of control of her future and her destiny. Just as horrible to her, she was beginning to feel like a charity case. \"I can\u0027t give you an opinion of Morgan,\" Caine remarked. \"I\u0027ve never met him.\" \"I\u0027ve met him,\" his father said. \"I liked him well enough. Perhaps we could invite him over for… Why in God\u0027s name are you shaking your head now, Colin?\" \"Yes, brother,\" Caine interjected. \"What\u0027s wrong with Morgan?\" , Colin let out a sigh. He was having difficulty finding anything wrong with the man. Caine wasn\u0027t helping him concentrate. He started laughing. \"This isn\u0027t amusing,\" Colin snapped. \"Yes, it is,\" Caine contradicted. \"Let\u0027s see now,\" he drawled out. \"So far we\u0027ve discarded nine possible candidates because of drunkenness, averice, gluttony, jealousy, perversion, greed, lust, and so on, and I\u0027d really love to hear your reason for finding Morgan unsuitable. I believe you\u0027ve used up all the seven deadly sins, Colin.\" \"What are you suggesting, Caine?\" Colin demanded. \"You don\u0027t like any of them.\" \"Damned right I don\u0027t. I\u0027m thinking of Alesandra\u0027s happiness. She\u0027s a princess. She deserves better.\" That last remark told Caine everything he needed to know. He now understood why Colin was in such a foul mood. It was obvious to Caine that his brother wanted Alesandra, but in his mind he had decided he wasn\u0027t worthy enough. Oh, yes, that was it, Caine decided. Colin was the second son and therefore hadn\u0027t inherited land or title. His obsession with building an empire was all part of his quest to achieve recognition on his own. Caine was proud that his brother was an independent man, but, damn it all, that pride would force him to let Alesandra slip away. Unless he was forced into marriage, of course. \"But what about Morgan?\" his father asked again. \"What\u0027s wrong with him?\" \"Nothing,\" Colin snapped. His father was beginning to smile when Colin added, \"If Alesandra doesn\u0027t mind bowlegged children.\" \"For the love of…\" His father slumped back against the cushions in defeat. \"Is Morgan bowlegged?\" Caine asked Alesandra. He was feeling quite proud of himself. He\u0027d been able to ask that question without even cracking a smile. \"I must confess I didn\u0027t notice his legs, but if Colin says he\u0027s bowlegged, then he must be. Will I have to have children?\" \"Yes,\" Colin told her. \"He won\u0027t do then. I don\u0027t wish to have bowlegged children.\" She turned to look up at Colin. \"Is it a painful condition?\" she asked him in a whisper. \"Yes,\" Colin lied. The discussion continued for another hour. Caine and his father both took turns tossing out names of possible husbands and Colin found something wrong with every one of them. Caine was thoroughly enjoying himself. He pulled the footrest over, stretched out, and propped his feet up so that he\u0027d be more comfortable. Colin was becoming more and more agitated. He\u0027d removed his arm from Alesandra\u0027s shoulders and was now leaning forward with his elbows on his knees while he waited for his father to think of another candidate. The longer the talk continued, the more upset Alesandra became. She hid behind her mask of serenity, but her hands were clutched into fists in her lap. Just when she thought she couldn\u0027t stand to hear another name offered, Colin leaned back and covered her hands with one of his. She didn\u0027t want his comfort, yet she clung to his hand. \"Alesandra, what do you want to do?\" Caine asked her that question. She was too embarrassed to tell him the truth, to admit that more than anything she wished she could marry a man she loved. She wanted the kind of marriage her parents had had, but that wasn\u0027t possible. \"I thought I wanted to become a nun, but Mother Superior wouldn\u0027t let me.\" There were tears in her eyes and for that reason no one laughed. \"And why wouldn\u0027t she let you?\" Caine asked. \"I\u0027m not Catholic,\" Alesandra explained. \"It\u0027s an important requirement.\" He did smile then. He simply couldn\u0027t help it. \"You wouldn\u0027t have been happy as a nun,\" he predicted. She wasn\u0027t particularly happy now, but she didn\u0027t believe it would be polite to mention that. \"Alesandra, why don\u0027t you go and find Gweneth,\" her guardian suggested. \"You haven\u0027t met Jade yet, now have you? Go and introduce yourself to Caine\u0027s lovely wife.\" She acted as though she\u0027d just been given a reprieve. The look of relief on her face was there for all of them to see. Alesandra had stood up before she realized she hadn\u0027t let go of Colin\u0027s hand yet. She quickly pulled away, and then left the room. The three men stood up until she\u0027d left the salon, then resumed their seats. Colin dragged the footrest over, propped his feet up, and leaned back. \"This is damned difficult for her,\" he muttered. \"Yes,\" his father agreed. \"I wish there was time for her to adjust to her circumstances, but there isn\u0027t, Colin.\" Caine decided to turn the topic. \"I\u0027m curious, Father,\" he remarked. \"How did you meet Alesandra\u0027s father?\" \"It was at Ashford\u0027s annual bash,\" his father explained. \"Nathaniel and I took to one another right away. He was quite a man,\" he added with a nod. \"And so are you to take on responsibility for his daughter,\" Colin remarked. His father\u0027s expression underwent a dramatic change. He looked terribly sad now. \"No, you\u0027ve got it all wrong,\" he said. \"There is something neither one of you knows and I imagine now is the time for me to confess my sins. You\u0027re going to find out sooner or later.\" The seriousness in their father\u0027s voice told both sons the matter was of grave importance. They gave him their full attention and waited for him to compose his thoughts. Long minutes passed before he spoke again. \"I got into trouble just after your mother died, Caine,\" he explained. \"I hadn\u0027t met Gweneth yet and I had started drinking—quite heavily, as a matter of fact.\" \"You? But you never drink,\" Colin argued. \"I don\u0027t drink now,\" his father agreed. \"I did back then. I gambled too. The debts, they piled up, of course, and I kept fooling myself into believing I would win back enough to cover my losses.\" Colin and Caine were too astonished to say anything. They stared at their father as though he\u0027d suddenly turned into a complete stranger. \"This is a difficult confession for me to make,\" he continued. \"No father likes parading his sins in front of his sons.\" \"The past is over,\" Colin told him. \"Let it go.\" His father shook his head. \"It isn\u0027t as simple as all that,\" he explained. \"I want you to understand. I was almost ruined, you see, and would have been if it hadn\u0027t been for Alesandra\u0027s father. Everything I\u0027d inherited and worked so hard to build was in the hands of the moneylenders as collateral against the loans. Yes, I would have been ruined.\" \"What happened then?\" Caine asked when his father didn\u0027t continue. \"Nathaniel came to my rescue. I was at White\u0027s one minute and the next I remember I was back home. I was told I blacked out at the tables from too much drink. When I next opened my eyes, Nathaniel was standing over me, and, Lord, was he angry. I was so hung over all I wanted was to be left alone. He wouldn\u0027t leave, however. He threatened me too.\" \"What was his threat?\" Caine asked. He was so surprised by his father\u0027s confession he leaned forward and clasped his hands together in expectation.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/castles-crown-s-spies-4/page-16.html","bookId":1789,"book":{"id":1789,"title":"Castles (Crown\u0027s Spies #4)","description":"Storyline: Orphaned and besieged Princess Alesandra knew that only hasty marriage to an Englishman could protect her from the turmoil in her own land.
