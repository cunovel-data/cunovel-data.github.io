(Partly because we totally weren\u0027t supposed to be there. Partly because…well … it was a really ugly minivan.)\n But Liz just said, \"Get in.\" Then she stopped. \"Who\u0027s driving?\"\n Bex dove for the keys, but given her tendency to forget which side of the road we\u0027re supposed to be on, I snatched them out of her grasp.\n \"Liz,\" I said again, eyeing the rusty fender, \"when you said you could get us a car… Liz, where did you get this car?\"\n \"It\u0027s a project,\" she said simply, strapping herself into the backseat.\n I pulled at the drivers-side door, and for a second I thought it would fall off its hinges. I looked at the seat. Stuffing was bursting through its fraying seams. The steering wheel was being held together almost entirely by duct tape.\n \"What kind of project?\" I asked, almost afraid of the answer because something told me that pushing that van to Philadelphia wasn\u0027t really going to help our mission objectives.\n \"Oh, give me those,\" Bex said, grabbing the keys from my hand. She jammed them into the ignition and turned and then…nothing.\n \"Great!\" I snapped. \"It doesn\u0027t even work.\" But then I felt it. The car was running, but it was almost completely silent, almost completely still.\n \"New technology,\" Liz said with a shrug. \"Dr. Fibs has been helping me. We\u0027ve got it up to 250 miles per gallon now,\" she said, with only the teeniest hint of a gloating smile. \"But I think I\u0027ll have it doing 325 by Christmas.\"\n And who says Gallagher Girls on the research and operations track never get a chance to save the world?\n We spent the next few hours in silence. Well, if by silence you mean that Liz was rattling on nonstop like she does when she\u0027s nervous, and Bex was totally tuning her out like she does when she\u0027s nervous. And me? I just drove, listening to the rain that started as we crossed the Pennsylvania border. The windshield wipers must not have been as high-tech as the engine because they stuck and stalled, leaving streaks across the glass that caught the light of passing headlights, and by the time we made it to Philadelphia, everything was a blur.\n \"Right turn,\" Liz said, navigating our way through narrow cobblestone streets. Buildings older than the Declaration of Independence rose into the rainy sky. Maybe I was expecting the noise of Ohio, the blockades and chaos of the convention, but instead we peered out the grimy windshield onto the slick black streets, and I couldn\u0027t help thinking that something felt…different.\n \"Are you sure this is the right place?\" I asked. Liz leaned between the two front seats, but before she could act too insulted, we turned and saw a great stone building that covered two city blocks. Massive columns spanned its front entrance, so that it looked more like a Roman temple than a train station. And there, in the center of the façade, was a banner fifty feet long that read WINTERS-McHENRY: PUTTING AMERICA BACK ON TRACK.\n The rain fell harder. Puddles collected on the sidewalks. And beside me, Bex said, \"We\u0027re here.\"\n Chapter Seventeen\n Every mission is a lesson—in school and in life. And before we even reached the doors of the 30th Street station, I learned two very important things.\n 1. Getting dressed with two other girls in the back of a Dodge minivan should totally be worth extra credit in P\u0026E.\n 2. Even if they are your best friends, you should never ever trust another operative to pack for you.\n \"I cannot believe I am wearing this,\" I muttered as I tugged at the hem of the little black dress Bex had personally smuggled out of Sub level Two. But it didn\u0027t feel like a dress. It felt like…torture. Torture with a very low back and very high shoes.\n Stretch limousines were lined up outside the main stairs. Secret Service agents stood guard at every possible exit, but still Bex whispered, \"The key to deception and disguise is to break with tendencies and norms.\"\n And right then I knew that having genius friends who are really good at memorizing textbooks can sometimes be a very bad thing, because Bex was right: nothing about that dress was norm.\n Still, I couldn\u0027t help saying, \"Then you should be wearing it.\" But Bex just shrugged.\n \"I\u0027d love to,\" she said. \"And that\u0027s the problem.\"\n Here\u0027s the thing you need to know about disguise: it\u0027s not about being unseen. It\u0027s not about being unnoticed. It\u0027s about being unrecognized—shedding your own skin. And right then I wasn\u0027t worried about the Secret Service or five hundred influential party donors. Right then our only concern was Aunt Abby: fooling her meant leaving our own identities in the van.\n I glanced at Liz, whose long blond hair was hidden beneath a dark brown wig. Bex was wearing a wig too, plus glasses and a padded bodysuit that changed the natural silhouette of her athletic frame. We had used every trick in the Gallagher Academy closet, and as we passed the darkened windows of the station, I caught a glimpse of three strangers before realizing that, amazingly, they were us. I didn\u0027t even recognize myself under the wig, colored contacts, and fake nose that changed my forgettable face into one that…wasn\u0027t.\n \"Okay, gang,\" I said, \"according to blueprints, there\u0027s an elevator access panel on the east side of the building. We may get a little dirty, but—\"\n \"I thought we\u0027d just go through the doors,\" Liz said, flashing three beautifully engraved invitations and some wonderfully authentic fake IDs.\n The tickets were $20,000 each. The Secret Service had been vetting the guest list for weeks, so Bex and I stopped beneath a streetlamp and studied Liz.\n \"Do I even want to know where you got those?\" I asked.\n Liz seemed to ponder it, and then she said, \"No.\"\n And just like that I remembered that Liz was probably the most dangerous one of us all.\n Stepping inside the station was like stepping inside another world. Beautiful carvings covered a ceiling that was at least fifty feet tall. A string quartet played from the second-story balcony, their music echoing off the stone floors, while five hundred men and women ate and drank and talked about the road to the White House.\n I didn\u0027t want to think about the kind of favors someone had had to call in to close down the entire station for the night (and come to think of it, an actual act of Congress might have been involved), so I just stood at the top of the steps with my best friends and a great statue of the angel Michael, who held a fallen soldier in his arms, his wings poised to take flight. Somehow, it felt like all four of us were on the lookout for Macey.\n \"Any sign?\" I asked twenty minutes later as I walked through the crowd.\n \"Negative,\" Bex replied.\n \"Wow, did you guys know the Pennsylvania train system dates back to—\"\n \"Liz!\" Bex and I snapped in unison.\n \"It\u0027s Bookworm,\" Liz corrected, and I couldn\u0027t really complain.\n \"Bookworm, what did the official agenda say again?\" I asked, needing to hear it.\n \"It said Macey will be making one public appearance today. She\u0027ll be arriving at seven thirty via the Back on Track Express—whatever that is.\"\n \"What time is it?\" I said.\n \"You know what time it is,\" Bex reminded me, but I was hoping I was wrong, because the candidates and their families were…late.\n Late meant mistakes.\n Mistakes meant problems.\n And problems…well, I really didn\u0027t want to think about what those meant.\n Mr. Solomon\u0027s warning kept coming back to me as I surveyed the crowd, remembering that the bad guys could be anyone, that they could be anywhere—that they knew who we were. And they just had to get lucky…once.\n Maybe it was my spy training; maybe it was a crazy, hyperactive imagination, but it seemed like everywhere I looked, people seemed suspicious.\n There was a man with a red bow tie who bumped into me not once, not twice, but three times and was a little…handsy. My first instinct was to call out for Macey on the comms to see if he was flirting, but then I remembered that the one Gallagher Girl who was certain to have an answer to that question was the one Gallagher Girl I couldn\u0027t ask.\n \"Chameleon,\" Bex\u0027s voice rang in my ear. \"Cammie, are you—\"\n \"I\u0027m here,\" I said.\n \"What\u0027s wrong?\" her accent was heavy again.\n \"Nothing. I mean—\" I was spinning, being about as uncovert as I could possibly be, but something was … wrong.\n \"Eyes,\" I said, citing an operative\u0027s ultimate resource— her instincts. \"I feel eyes. Someone\u0027s…watching.\"\n \"Yeah,\" Bex said, her voice thick with a resounding duh. \"You look hot.\"\n Well, that explained one thing, because covert I\u0027m good at. Invisible I\u0027m good at. Hot I am totally not good at.\n I pushed through the crowds again, knowing that it was getting later and later, and I couldn\u0027t help worrying more and more. Flashes of Boston went through my mind. I closed my eyes and shuddered, saw an almost identical crowd, felt that almost identical feeling.\n \"Bookworm, Duchess,\" I started, but then I stopped because I didn\u0027t have a clue how that sentence was supposed to end.\n \"Any sign of them?\" I asked instead.\n \"No buses,\" Liz told me from her vantage point by the window.\n \"No sign at the east entrance. Wait,\" Bex said, stopping short.\n The feeling of the crowd was changing. An energy so palpable was coursing through the old historic station that I looked out the massive windows at the cloudy sky, half expecting lightning.\n \"Oh my gosh,\" Liz exclaimed, echoing Bex\u0027s surprise.\n \"What?\" I said out loud, not caring if anyone noticed. I spun, looking at the station\u0027s main entrance, but then I felt the crowd shift behind me. I turned slowly and realized there was no bus. There was no convoy.\n Instead, a long, ancient-looking train with old-fashioned red, white, and blue bunting hanging from the caboose was slowly moving into the station.\n In the next instant it didn\u0027t matter how great our comms units were, because the cry that came up from five hundred rabid voters was enough to drown out even the sound of my best friends\u0027 voices in my ear.\n Governor Winters and Macey\u0027s dad stepped out onto the stage behind the caboose, and then their wives. Macey and Preston were one step behind them.\n I waited for the fear in my stomach to subside. I told myself I was crazy. After all, Macey was smiling. She was waving. She was the perfect operative with the perfect cover. Aunt Abby was beside her. She was fine.\n For a second a wave of relief like nothing I\u0027d ever known swept over me. But then the crowd shifted, and for a split second my gaze fell on a man,\n A man with crazy white hair and wild eyebrows.\n A man I had seen before.\n In Boston.\n Chapter Eighteen\n It didn\u0027t mean it was something. Odds were, it was probably nothing. After all, there were probably a lot of people who went to political conventions and political rallies. And the Secret Service was there—the Secret Service was good.\n Still, I didn\u0027t know what was scarier, that I\u0027d seen a man in the crowd who I\u0027d literally bumped into on the very day my roommate had been attacked, or that—just that quickly—the familiar face had vanished.\n \"Duchess!\" I practically shouted, but the crowd was too loud, the race too close, and the people who wanted the Winters-McHenry ticket to win on Election Day were too fired up as I called through our comms units for my friends. \"Duchess, there was a guy … in a suit …\" I climbed the main staircase to better scan the platform, and that\u0027s where I realized that I\u0027d just described half of the clapping crowd. \"A dark suit,\" I added. \"Crazy-looking white hair. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/don-t-judge-a-girl-by-her-cover-gallagher-girls-3/page-17.html","bookId":2748,"book":{"id":2748,"title":"Don\u0027t Judge a Girl by Her Cover (Gallagher Girls #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Don\u0027t Judge a Girl by Her Cover (Gallagher Girls #3) \n When Cammie \"The Chameleon\" Morgan visits her roommate Macey in Boston, she thinks she\u0027s in for an exciting end to her summer break.
