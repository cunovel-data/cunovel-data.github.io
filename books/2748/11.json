{"id":83155,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"After all, it\u0027s one thing to take a group of highly trained teenage future spies and drop them off in a crowd of thousands and tell them to find the potential security threat. It\u0027s quite another to take those same girls, equip them with comms units tuned to the same frequency as the Secret Service (not that the Secret Service actually knew or anything), and tell them to sit back and enjoy the show.\\n\\n I don\u0027t even like letting someone else put the syrup on my waffles (I have a system), so letting other people be in charge of Macey\u0027s safety…well…let\u0027s just say it was a little out of my comfort zone.\\n\\n And if that wasn\u0027t bad enough, the jeans that someone had packed for me to change into were a little on the snug side. And I don\u0027t know about everyone else, but Bex Baxter is the only girl I know who can enter and exit a helicopter without having it do really unfortunate things to her hair.\\n\\n Most of all, I wanted to pretend that I still believed I lived in a world where hair and jeans really mattered. But I didn\u0027t. So I just thought about my mission and stared out into the crowd.\\n\\n And then I disappeared.\\n\\n The Essentials of Being a Chameleon By Cameron Ann Morgan\\n\\n 1. It\u0027s very important, at all times, to look like you belong.\\n\\n 2. When #I is difficult, try pointing to imaginary people and walking purposefully toward no one.\\n\\n 3. Stillness. Stillness is key (except when you\u0027re doing #2) because people see motion more easily than they see things. So when in doubt, freeze.\\n\\n 4. It totally helps if you aren\u0027t all that special looking (in either really good or really bad ways).\\n\\n 5. Acquaint yourself with your surroundings ASAP.\\n\\n 6. Dress in a way that isn\u0027t flashy, fashionable, ugly, or obscene.\\n\\n 7. Hiding is for amateurs.\\n\\n \"This is…wow,\" Bex said ten minutes after we\u0027d arrived at the park … or what I think was supposed to be a park.\\n\\n A long grassy promenade covered at least two city blocks. Beautiful historic buildings lined the space, but at the far end, someone had erected a stage. Bleachers circled behind it, facing the lawn, and from where Bex and I stood it seemed like half of Ohio had come out to see Macey\u0027s triumphant return.\\n\\n Over the loudspeakers I heard a local politician trying to make the people on the bleachers behind him chant \"Winters\" while the people on the grass in front of the stage were told to yell \"McHenry.\"\\n\\n \"Are American politics always so…crazy?\" my best friend whispered.\\n\\n I wanted to tell her that this was nothing compared to the insanity of the convention (because, for example, I hadn\u0027t seen anyone with hats shaped like produce…yet), but somehow bringing up Boston didn\u0027t seem like a good idea, so instead I just nodded and tried to squeeze through the crowds.\\n\\n A massive banner (that I\u0027m fairly sure was also bulletproof) circled the stage, reading walk the walk. I turned and scanned the long stretch of barricades that ran through the center of the crowd. A huge tour bus turned onto the street and stopped at the end of the alleyway that cut through the audience. Its doors swung open, and somewhere in the distance, the Tri-County High School Marching Band started to play as Governor Winters and The Senator stepped out and started down the long promenade full of hands to shake and babies to kiss—two thousand screaming people, any one of whom could have given me the bump on my head.\\n\\n In my ear I heard a steady stream of unfamiliar voices.\\n\\n \"Sir, could you remove your hands from your pockets, please?\" a tall Secret Service agent asked the man behind me.\\n\\n \"Delta team, I don\u0027t like the looks of the guy on the library steps. I repeat, the library steps.\"\\n\\n Instantly, I felt the entire junior CoveOps class from the\\n\\n Gallagher Academy for Exceptional Young Women pivot to see a guy in a trench coat approach a man in a plaid shirt and block his view of the candidates, who were passing in the street below them.\\n\\n A group of women were waving a sign that read god bless you, macey and preston, and as if on cue, Preston ran toward the women and hugged them while, twenty feet away, CNN carried the whole scene live and in color.\\n\\n But Macey didn\u0027t run anywhere. Or hug anyone (which is totally in character anyway—kidnapping attempt or not). Instead she held her father\u0027s hand. She waved. She smiled.\\n\\n \"We have to be perfect every second of every day, ladies.\" I\u0027ve heard Joe Solomon say some pretty heady stuff in the past two years, but I don\u0027t think I\u0027d ever heard him sound more solemn than when he said, \"The bad guys just have to get lucky…once.\"\\n\\n And then I couldn\u0027t help it. I thought about Boston, I thought about luck. I thought about how close we came to having a very bad ending to our summer vacation.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know if any of you will go into protection services someday or not, ladies, but if you do…\" Mr. Solomon\u0027s voice was soft in my ear, steady against the din of Secret Service orders, \"This is your worst nightmare.\"\\n\\n At that moment, I\u0027m pretty sure Bex wanted to drag our roommate into the nearest bulletproof automobile and drive back to Roseville as quickly as humanly possible. But that wasn\u0027t going to happen because 1) the real Secret Service might shoot us if we tried, 2) the CNN correspondents might have some interesting questions if Bex took out Senator McHenry\u0027s body men with two well-placed kicks, and 3) our midterm grades were probably riding on doing exactly not that, and as if we needed reminding, our teacher\u0027s voice was a constant in our ears.\\n\\n \"Given the wind velocity and direction, the greatest threat from sniper assault is where, Ms. Morrison?\"\\n\\n Bex and I looked at each other and mouthed, \"The church steeple,\" just as Mick said those very words.\\n\\n \"Four members of the Secret Service have infiltrated the protesters across the street, Ms. Fetterman,\" Mr. Solomon asked again. \"Identify the agents.\"\\n\\n \"Uh …\" Anna started while, on the street in front of us, Aunt Abby and Macey were walking by. \"Red backpack,\" Anna answered. \"Lady in the blue bandanna. The man in the yellow T-shirt, and…\" She trailed off.\\n\\n \"Anyone?\" Mr. Solomon asked.\\n\\n \"The guy with the long red beard,\" I found myself saying. I wasn\u0027t sure when I\u0027d even seen him, but as soon as I said the words I knew they were true.\\n\\n \"Why?\" Mr. Solomon questioned.\\n\\n \"The static,\" I said. \"Two and a half minutes ago there was a burst of static on the Secret Service frequency. He flinched.\"\\n\\n Somewhere in the crowd of bodies, I could have sworn I felt Joe Solomon smile.\\n\\n I used to wonder if Secret Service Agents ever got tired of hearing the same speeches from the same people a dozen times a day every day until someone either has to give a speech that says they won or give a speech that says they lost. But after that day I started wondering if the security team even heard the speeches at all.\\n\\n \"Beta team, protesters stay in Level Two. I repeat, protesters stay in Level Two,\" one of the anonymous voices said.\\n\\n \"Charlie team, we have unusual movement in a window in the City National Bank building,\" another voice said, and in a flash, all the blinds on the fourth floor of the building across the street were pulled down.\\n\\n And then … a voice I recognized. \"Peacock is stage- ready and moving.\"\\n\\n \"Aunt Abby,\" I whispered to Bex.\\n\\n \"Peacock?\" she whispered back.\\n\\n Onstage, The Senator was sweeping out his hand and saying, \"Family. I don\u0027t have to tell the Buckeye state how much family means to me.\"\\n\\n The crowd cheered wildly for a few minutes, but when Macey replaced her father at the microphone, a hush fell so completely over the Ohio swing voters that I could have sworn someone or something had turned the volume down.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s great being here today.\" Macey looked out over the crowd. She looked lost for a moment—dazed. But then I could have sworn her gaze fell on Bex and me. A new light seemed to fill her eyes as she looked at us and added, \"With my family.\" At this point Senator McHenry put his arm around his wife, and I couldn\u0027t help thinking about Clipboard Lady\u0027s direction of \"spontaneous hugging.\"\\n\\n \"And there\u0027s something I want to say,\" Macey went on, even stronger now. \"There\u0027s nothing we can\u0027t do if we stick together. There\u0027s nothing we can\u0027t overcome if we try. I learned that from the people who love me. The people who know…the real me.\" This time I knew Macey was looking straight at us.\\n\\n Beside me, I heard Bex whisper, \"That\u0027s our girl.\"\\n\\n \"Ms. Baxter.\" Mr. Solomon\u0027s voice brought us back to the moment, to the mission. \"There\u0027s a man thirty feet behind you in a denim jacket. Get his fingerprints without his knowledge.\" With a wink, Bex was gone.\\n\\n There were more speeches, more cheering, but eventually Macey walked down the steps on the left side of the stage and through a gap in the bleachers that led to a secure area behind the stands. As soon as she disappeared, I heard my aunt\u0027s voice saying, \"Peacock is secure and holding in the yellow tent,\" and I took my first deep breath since Sunday night.\\n\\n The crowd was staring at the stage while Governor Winters said, \"Our opponents have had four years to talk the talk, but now it\u0027s time to walk the walk!\" People clapped. People laughed. It was like he was a puppet master and two thousand people jumped every time he pulled the strings.\\n\\n But I didn\u0027t clap. I didn\u0027t laugh. I just kept hearing Mr. Solomon\u0027s voice—not in my ear—in my head. I remembered something he\u0027d said in the helicopter. \"Protection is ten\\n\\n percent protocol and ninety percent instinct.\"\\n\\n And just then my instincts were telling me to turn around. Maybe it was the way the buildings lined the grassy lawn, maybe it was the crowd of people that passed by me, but something made me think about last semester and Washington, D.C. So while The Senator and Governor Winters stood with their hands locked together above their heads, and the band started playing, I turned and watched the crowd clapping and dancing. The candidates pushed toward the barriers, and the crowd rushed closer, but one guy slipped away.\\n\\n Farther from the bulletproof banner.\\n\\n Farther from everything.\\n\\n Except the bleachers and the yellow tent that stood behind them.\\n\\n Another banner hung from the side of the bleachers, advertising www.winters-mchenry.com, and I watched it blow in the breeze, a corner flapping free, banging against the aluminum posts, but no one noticed the sound. No one saw the gap. No civilian would have appreciated that sliver of access, and what it meant. But the guy in the cap walked toward the banner. He slipped through the tiny crack, and that\u0027s when I knew he was a pavement artist.\\n\\n I knew he was like me.\\n\\n \"No,\" I felt myself scream; but with the band and the crowd and the chatter of agents securing the rope lines, the word was lost. And he was gone.\\n\\n I followed, pushing through the gap myself, but all I could see was litter and the tangled wires and rods of the metal stands.\\n\\n For such a sunny day, it was dark under the bleachers; for such a screaming crowd, the noise seemed very far away. A warm breeze blew red, white, and blue confetti across my feet, while the band played and the people cheered.\\n\\n And I felt someone behind me.\\n\\n And for the second time that month, a strange hand grasped my shoulder.\\n\\n I forgot all about Mr. Solomon\u0027s assignment as I reached back and grabbed the offending hand, stepped into the move, and swung the guy smoothly through the air, watching him crash onto a red balloon with a pop. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/don-t-judge-a-girl-by-her-cover-gallagher-girls-3/page-11.html","bookId":2748,"book":{"id":2748,"title":"Don\u0027t Judge a Girl by Her Cover (Gallagher Girls #3)","description":"Storyline: Don\u0027t Judge a Girl by Her Cover (Gallagher Girls #3) \\n When Cammie \"The Chameleon\" Morgan visits her roommate Macey in Boston, she thinks she\u0027s in for an exciting end to her summer break.
