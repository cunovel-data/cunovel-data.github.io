{"id":83160,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"I might have argued; I might have pleaded, but right then I realized that Bex and I weren\u0027t the only ones who had been born into a family business—a genetic fate. Macey\u0027s first full sentence had been \"Vote for Daddy,\" and not even a kidnapping attempt, midterms, and the three of us could keep her off the campaign trail.\\n\\n As Bex pulled me toward the elevator and Sublevel Two, the chaos of the halls faded away, replaced by the smooth whirring of the elevator and the lasers and the sounds of a new set of worries in my head.\\n\\n \"What?\" Bex asked.\\n\\n \"Zach,\" I said numbly.\\n\\n \"Cam, he is bloody dreamy—I\u0027m not going to deny you that—but I don\u0027t think boys are really the most important thing right now.\"\\n\\n \"Zach got through.\"\\n\\n I thought about him standing behind the bleachers. I thought about me standing behind the bleachers. In the restricted zone. \"Zach got through security. If he did …\" I trailed off, not wanting to say the worst of what was on my mind. Bex nodded, not wanting to hear it.\\n\\n A moment later we were stepping out of the elevator. Our footsteps echoed as we ran, around and around and around the spiraling ramp, lower into the depths of the school.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t worry, Cam,\" Bex said, not even close to being winded. \"We\u0027ll think of something. If Mr. Solomon doesn\u0027t kill us for being late.\"\\n\\n But then she stopped. Partly, I think, because we\u0027d finally reached the classroom; partly because our teacher— perhaps our best teacher, our strictest teacher—was nowhere to be seen.\\n\\n I don\u0027t know how normal girls behave when a teacher is out of the room, but Gallagher Girls get quiet. Crazy quiet. Because operatives in training learn very early on that you can never really trust that you\u0027re alone.\\n\\n So Bex didn\u0027t say anything. I didn\u0027t say anything. Even Tina Walters was speechless.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re the juniors?\"\\n\\n The voice was one I didn\u0027t know. I turned to see a face I didn\u0027t recognize. A man. An older man in a Gallagher Academy maintenance department uniform. His name badge read \"Art,\" and he was glaring at us as if he knew we were personally responsible for the terrible hydrochloric acid spill in Dr. Fibs\u0027s lab, which had probably taken weeks to clean up.\\n\\n \"Solomon said you were the juniors,\" Art told us.\\n\\n \"Yes, sir,\" Mick said, because 1) We\u0027ve all been taking culture class since we were in the seventh grade and Madame Dabney does her job well, and 2) at the Gallagher Academy, everyone is more than they appear.\\n\\n We look like normal girls, but we\u0027re not. Our teachers could blend in with any prep school faculty in the world, but they\u0027re so much more. Every girl in that room knew that to spend your retirement in the Gallagher Academy maintenance department you must have had high clearance and massive skills—you\u0027re there for a reason. So Art was a \"sir\" to us. No doubt about it.\\n\\n Still, Art looked at us as if we were exactly what he was expecting.\\n\\n As he turned and started out the door, we stared after him. But then he stopped and called back over his shoulder. \"Well? Are you coming or aren\u0027t ya?\"\\n\\n We got up and followed Art exactly the way we\u0027d come.\\n\\n No one asked about Mr. Solomon, but one glance at the girls following in the maintenance man\u0027s wake told me that we were all wondering the exact same thing.\\n\\n Well, make that two things: 1.) Where was Mr. Solomon? and 2.) What had happened to Art?\\n\\n The man walked with a slight limp, his right foot never landing evenly upon the stone floor. His left hand hung against his side at an odd angle, and thick bottle-like glasses must have made the world look very different through his eyes.\\n\\n But none of that kept him from snapping, \"Walters!\" when Tina whispered something to Eva, so I\u0027m pretty sure there wasn\u0027t anything wrong with his hearing.\\n\\n We passed ancient wooden doors with locks that looked like they must have required two-ton keys. We climbed higher, past rooms that looked like sets from old monster movies.\\n\\n When we neared the top, we all walked faster, toward the elevator, anticipating that we were smart enough, seasoned enough, savvy enough to guess what would come next. But one of the golden rules of covert operations is Always anticipate, never commit, and that would have been a good time to remember it.\\n\\n Because Art called, \"Ladies!\" And the entire class skidded to a stop. We turned to see the man standing in front of one of those enormous doors that, until then, I\u0027d never seen open. He reached inside and flipped on a switch. Light replaced shadow and danced over the stone floor as he took a step on his crooked leg.\\n\\n \"Bex,\" I whispered as we followed him inside. \"Did he seem…\"\\n\\n But I didn\u0027t finish. Oh, who am I kidding—I couldn\u0027t finish. Because the room we were stepping into wasn\u0027t just an ordinary room. It wasn\u0027t a place for an ordinary class.\\n\\n Rows of clothes lined two long walls. In the center, shelves stood covered with accessories. Mirrors sat in a long row along the back of the room, shelves and drawers, all neatly labeled, sat waiting.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a closet,\" Eva Alvarez said in awe.\\n\\n \"And it\u0027s…huge,\" Tina Walters replied.\\n\\n I know normal girls would probably love to find themselves inside a closet two times the size of most suburban houses. But not this closet. This closet could only truly be appreciated by a Gallagher Girl.\\n\\n We all stepped inside, knowing we were on the verge of a lesson unlike any we\u0027d ever had.\\n\\n Eva reached out for another switch, and the lights surrounding the mirrors at the back of the room came to life, washing over hats and wigs, glasses and false teeth. Overcoats and umbrellas.\\n\\n I looked at the man who had brought us there. I turned my gaze from his crippled leg and mangled arm…and I knew.\\n\\n Art stepped to the center of the room and said, \"Ladies.\" He took off his glasses with his left arm, which, for the first time, seemed normal and straight. He kicked off his right shoe, picked it up, and let a small pebble fall into his hand, and then stood squarely upon his right leg. And then finally he pulled off the gray wig and dropped it onto the low center shelf that ran the length of the room.\\n\\n Tina Walters gasped. Anna Fetterman stumbled backward. Mr. Solomon was the only one in the room smiling as he swept his arms around the Gallagher Academy closet. \"Small changes. Big differences.\"\\n\\n He unbuttoned \"Art\u0027s\" shirt and stood in front of us in a white T-shirt (the black trousers, however, he kept on). \"Welcome to the science of disguise.\"\\n\\n A full minute later, half the class was still staring at Joe Solomon, wondering how old, kinda-pitiful Art could have been the same totally hot guy we had seen every school day for more than a year.\\n\\n But I was turning, staring at a chameleon\u0027s utter fantasy—a place with the sole purpose of making a girl disappear.\\n\\n And then I saw Bex, and my joy was instantly replaced with unease.\\n\\n Because she was smiling. And nodding. And whispering, \"Plan B?\"\\n\\n Chapter Sixteen\\n\\n Covert Operations Report\\n\\n After learning that Operative McHenry was in danger from a person (or persons) knowing the real identity of the Gallagher Academy for Exceptional Young Women, Operatives Morgan, Baxter, and Sutton decided to implement a shadow operation to oversee Operative McHenry\u0027s security.\\n\\n It also involved a lot of shadow of the eye variety.\\n\\n Was it crazy? Yes.\\n\\n Was it necessary? Maybe.\\n\\n Was there any way to talk Bex out of it? Only if we agreed to go with the hog-tying option, so really, it seemed like our best bet.\\n\\n We spent all of Friday afternoon researching, planning, and doing some seriously covert accessorizing, but by\\n\\n Saturday morning all I could do was walk with Bex and Liz through the halls and fight the combination of nostalgia and nerves that seemed to be growing stronger with every step.\\n\\n After all, I hadn\u0027t been outside the grounds (unofficially) in months; I hadn\u0027t opened any of the secret passageways; I hadn\u0027t broken any rules. (Okay, I hadn\u0027t broken any big rules.)\\n\\n But as I reached for the statue of the Rozell sisters (two identical Gallagher Girls who had posed as double agents— literally—during World War I), I couldn\u0027t shake the feeling that I was about to trigger an opening into something much darker and deeper than any secret passageway I\u0027d ever found before.\\n\\n And that was before I heard Liz cry, \"Ew!\" and saw her jump back, stumble over Bex\u0027s foot, and slam against the wall, skinning her elbow in the process.\\n\\n The Operatives brought the necessary equipment for a detailed deception-and-disguise operation.\\n\\n They did not, however, bring the necessary equipment for killing spiders.\\n\\n Dusty cobwebs hung between the low beams like nature\u0027s little surveillance detectors. The biggest spiders I\u0027d ever seen scurried from the light, and I just stood there remembering that there are many, many reasons why a Gallagher Girl should keep in practice. One, you don\u0027t want to lose your edge. Two, you never know when you might have to call upon your training. And three, if you go too long without using your secret passages, other things tend to take over in your absence.\\n\\n Even Bex took a big step back. (Because, while Bex is perfectly willing to take on three armed attackers at once, spiders are an entirely different thing.) But Liz was the person I was staring at. After all, there we were, locked inside the safest place in the country, and yet she was already bleeding.\\n\\n \"Hey, Liz, maybe you should stay here. You know … set up and run a comms center?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s better if I\u0027m on site,\" she argued back.\\n\\n \"And cover for us,\" I added, \"if someone starts asking where we are.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s Saturday,\" she reminded me. \"In a huge building. That you are notorious for disappearing inside.\"\\n\\n \"But—\" I didn\u0027t know what was coming over me, but suddenly I felt like someone should change my nickname from Cammie the Chameleon to Cammie the Corrupter. I was about to break out of my school (again), to do something I wasn\u0027t supposed to be doing (again). But that wasn\u0027t what worried me as I looked at Liz, who barely weighed a hundred pounds, and then at the secret tunnel that might have been leading us to actual bad guys with actual guns. \"Liz, it\u0027s just that—\"\\n\\n \"Why aren\u0027t you telling Bex to stay behind?\" Liz shot back, but we all knew the answer: the only way Bex would miss this would be if she were unconscious. And tied up. And locked in a concrete bunker. In Siberia.\\n\\n Which was a thought that almost made me laugh. Almost. But when I heard Bex say, \"Maybe you should sit this one out, Lizzie,\" I knew my best friend was thinking it too. That once we went forward, there might not be any coming back. In a lot of ways.\\n\\n Liz is a genius—the kind of genius that puts the rest of us to shame. She no doubt knew the odds. She\u0027d probably calculated the chances of us getting caught, of us getting hurt, and (if it wasn\u0027t too traumatic for her to think about) of us getting knocked down a full letter grade on our midterms. But still she turned defiantly and pushed through the cobwebs.\\n\\n There was no hiding our tracks then—no turning back— so Bex swept her arm across the door, gesturing \"after you.\"\\n\\n I stepped into the darkness with nothing but my training and my cover and my friends who would follow me to the end of the earth, no matter what was waiting for us on the other side.\\n\\n Well, it turned out what was waiting for us was a 1987 Dodge minivan.\\n\\n And Liz had the keys. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/don-t-judge-a-girl-by-her-cover-gallagher-girls-3/page-16.html","bookId":2748,"book":{"id":2748,"title":"Don\u0027t Judge a Girl by Her Cover (Gallagher Girls #3)","description":"Storyline: Don\u0027t Judge a Girl by Her Cover (Gallagher Girls #3) \\n When Cammie \"The Chameleon\" Morgan visits her roommate Macey in Boston, she thinks she\u0027s in for an exciting end to her summer break.
