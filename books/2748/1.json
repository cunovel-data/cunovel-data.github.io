The roads were packed for miles, and everywhere I looked I saw shades of red, white, and blue. Everywhere I turned, I felt the eyes of trained professionals staring, seeing, recording every word, analyzing every glance within a dozen miles.\\n\\n Part of me wanted to break free of the big men in the dark suits who flanked me on either side; another part wanted to marvel at the bomb-sniffing dogs who were examining boxes twenty meters away. But most of all, I wanted to lie when another man, with a clipboard and an earpiece, asked for my name.\\n\\n After all, I\u0027ve spent a lot of time learning how to whip out false IDs and recite perfectly crafted cover stories in situations just like these, so it was harder than I thought\\n\\n to say, \"Cammie. Cammie Morgan.\"\\n\\n It was weirder than I would have guessed as I waited for him to scan the clipboard and say, \"You can go right in.\"\\n\\n As if I were simply a sixteen-year-old girl.\\n\\n As if I couldn\u0027t possibly be a threat.\\n\\n As if I didn\u0027t go to a school for spies.\\n\\n Walking through the hotel lobby, I couldn\u0027t help but remember the first assignment my covert operations teacher ever gave me: Notice things. Lights and cameras shone from every angle. A massive net full of red, white, and blue balloons snaked through the cavernous space like a patriotic python. Up on the mezzanine level, the Texas delegation was singing about yellow roses, while a woman walked by wearing a big foam hat shaped like a Georgia peach.\\n\\n I scanned the masses of old women and young girls. Husbands and wives. College kids and senior citizens. The last time I\u0027d been in a crowd like this was in a different season and a different city, so maybe it was the hotel\u0027s frigid air-conditioning or just a memory of a chilly day in D.C., but for some reason, I shivered and fought against a serious case of deja vu as I looked around and said the name I hadn\u0027t spoken in weeks. \"Zach.\"\\n\\n Then I blinked and wondered if a part of me would always worry that he might be on my tail.\\n\\n \"This way,\" the man beside me said, but we didn\u0027t stop at the end of the line, which twisted and turned in front of the marble-covered registration desk. We didn\u0027t even slow down as we passed between two rows of elevators. Instead we turned down a narrow hall that seemed half a world away from the bright lights and tall ceiling of the lobby. Plush carpeting gave way to chipped linoleum tiles until finally we were standing before an elevator I\u0027m pretty sure hotel guests were never intended to see.\\n\\n \"So, you\u0027re a friend of peacocks?\" the Secret Service agent asked while we waited for the doors to open.\\n\\n \"Excuse me?\" I asked, because even though I\u0027d never been in a really nice hotel, I was pretty sure they wouldn\u0027t have exotic birds on the penthouse level.\\n\\n \"Peacock,\" the agent said again as we stepped into the service car that was soon carrying us, nonstop, to the top floor. \"See, we use code names,\" he explained as if I were … a sixteen-year-old girl, \"when we talk about the protectee. So you and Peacock, you\u0027re … friends ?\" he asked, and again I realized that he wasn\u0027t looking at me the way a well- trained, well-armed security professional looks at a potential threat (because I know a thing or two about well-trained and well-armed security professionals!). Nope. He was looking at me like I was … a Gallagher Girl.\\n\\n Of course, if you\u0027re reading this you must already know that there are two types of people in this world—those who know the truth about what goes on inside the walls of the Gallagher Academy for Exceptional Young Women, and those who don\u0027t. Something in the way the agent was trying to weigh my slightly out-of-style clothes against the snooty reputation of my school told me that he was definitely the second type—that he assumed we were all rich; that he thought we were all spoiled; and that he had no idea what it really meant to be Gallagher Girl.\\n\\n And that was before I heard the screaming.\\n\\n As the elevator doors slid open, a high-pitched \"I am going to kill someone!\" echoed from behind the double doors at the end of the hall.\\n\\n And then I was one hundred percent certain that the man beside me didn\u0027t know the truth about my sisterhood, because he didn\u0027t draw his weapon; he didn\u0027t even flinch as a second Secret Service agent opened the double doors and whispered, \"Peacock is angry.\"\\n\\n Instead, he walked toward the screaming girl—even though she was a Gallagher Girl.\\n\\n Even though her name was Macey McHenry.\\n\\n Before that day, I\u0027d never been to Boston. I\u0027d never had a Secret Service escort. And I\u0027d definitely never been a VIP (or the friend/roommate/guest of a VIP) at a national political convention. But walking into what I\u0027m pretty sure was the hotel\u0027s second-nicest suite, I added another first to the list: I\u0027d never seen Macey McHenry as mad as she was then.\\n\\n \"Really, Macey, I think it\u0027s an adorable little puff piece.\" Cynthia McHenry\u0027s cool, mannered tone could not have been more different from her daughter\u0027s. \"He\u0027s the only son of a future president…You\u0027re the only daughter of a future vice president. … If people want to read about the possibility of a White House wedding eight years from now, I don\u0027t see any reason to stop them. Really, I don\u0027t know why you have to be so dramatic.\"\\n\\n Right then I made a mental note that if Mrs. McHenry thought Macey was too dramatic then she should probably never be left alone with the better part of our junior class.\\n\\n \"If that boy—\"\\n\\n \"That boy,\" her mother corrected, \"is Governor Winters\u0027s son—\"\\n\\n \"—tries to flirt with me—\" Macey went on, but Mrs. McHenry talked over her.\\n\\n \"And if appearing with that boy is going to give us a two- percent bump in Ohio, then you will appear with that boy.\"\\n\\n \"Percentages.\" Macey gave an exasperated sigh. \"You know I don\u0027t do math.\"\\n\\n Well, I have personally seen Macey McHenry do linear algebra without a calculator (after mastering our roommate Liz\u0027s system, of course), but the girl in front of me wasn\u0027t the Macey I knew from school. She wasn\u0027t the girl on the suite\u0027s TV either, smiling and waving and holding hands with her father on the national news. Instead she was the other kind of Gallagher Girl—the kind the agent had been expecting: the snobby kind, the spoiled kind, the kind who had crawled out of her parents\u0027 limousine and into our school nearly a year before with combat boots and a diamond nose stud.\\n\\n \"This was the scene this morning as Senator James McHenry and his family arrived here in Boston to join Governor Winters and officially accept the vice presidential nomination,\" the TV anchor was saying. But I doubt that Macey or her mother were even listening as they stared daggers at each other.\\n\\n \"You will do this, Macey,\" her mother said. \"You will—\"\\n\\n But then my escort cleared his throat, and Mrs. McHenry turned. I expected her to gush like she had on the phone when Macey had called to invite me to join them, but instead she waved in my direction and said, \"There, your little friend is here.\"\\n\\n Something in the way her mother spoke about me made Macey draw a breath. I was relieved that no one else noticed how my roommate\u0027s fists clenched tighter for just a moment before she spun around and snapped, \"We\u0027re going for a walk.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t forget the rehearsal!\" her mother called, but Macey was already pulling me through the double doors.\\n\\n I caught the agent\u0027s eye one final time as he tried to figure out what I could possibly have in common with the girl who was pulling me along. On the TV, someone said, \"Cynthia McHenry is a well-known businesswoman and philanthropist. The couple has one daughter, Macey, a student at the Gallagher Academy for Exceptional Young Women, in Roseville, Virginia.\"\\n\\n Our school.\\n\\n National television.\\n\\n A thousand thoughts raced through my mind before Macey slammed the doors behind us, as if trapping my worries on the other side. She smiled a mischievous smile, and for the first time that day I recognized my friend in the girl who stood before me. \"So, how do you like my cover?\"\\n\\n Chapter Two\\n\\n Spies have covers for every occasion: aliases and phony passports, pocket litter and fake IDs. A great operative can become someone else at the drop of a hat (and sometimes, actual hats are involved), but I\u0027d rarely seen someone as deeply undercover as Macey McHenry was then.\\n\\n \"Peacock is moving,\" one of the agents whispered into his cuff as I followed Macey through the Winters-McHenry temporary headquarters, past rows of laptop computers and screaming interns wearing business suits and campaign buttons and looking like they hadn\u0027t had a good night\u0027s sleep since New Hampshire. In fact, I actually heard one guy say, \"I haven\u0027t had a good night\u0027s sleep since New Hampshire.\"\\n\\n But Macey\u0027s black hair was as glossy as ever, her blue eyes perfectly clear. \"Jeez, Chameleon, do you have any idea how hard you are to track down?\" She walked on, seemingly unaware that she was like a princess, and the room was full of commoners who were there to make sure her father claimed his throne. \"I mean, first I tried the school, but have you ever tried to get anything out of Professor Buckingham?\" My roommate calmly rattled on as if her face weren\u0027t being broadcast into every home in America at that very moment. \"Anyway, then I asked the Secret Service, and—\"\\n\\n \"Wait,\" I interrupted. \"The Secret Service gave you my grandparents\u0027 telephone number?\"\\n\\n \"Well,\" Macey admitted, \"I asked the Secret Service for the number, but I ended up getting it from more covert sources.\"\\n\\n I lowered my voice when I asked, \"The agency?\"\\n\\n \"Liz,\" she whispered back, and I couldn\u0027t help smile as I thought about our tiniest/smartest roommate. \"So, have a good summer?\" Macey asked as we left the war room and started down another long hall.\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" I said, almost out of breath. Two months at my grandparents\u0027 ranch in Nebraska hadn\u0027t made me completely out of shape, but life moved at a different pace there, so it still felt like a struggle to keep up with Macey. \"It was good. Just…\"\\n\\n I thought about our classmates, who seemed to scatter to the far corners of the world whenever school wasn\u0027t in session. I thought about my mother, who had put me on a plane the first day of summer break and hadn\u0027t sent so much as a postcard since. And finally, I thought about two boys: one who I hadn\u0027t seen in months and one who I seemed to be imagining everywhere, but whom I knew I might never see again.\\n\\n \"Fine,\" I said finally. \"My summer was fine.\"\\n\\n Macey knew me pretty well by then, so she just smiled and said, \"Mine too.\"\\n\\n Our footsteps were whisper-soft against the carpeting as we entered the tunnel that passed under the street between the convention center and the hotel.\\n\\n Secret Service agents flanked the doors, and I heard one whisper into his sleeve, \"Peacock is arriving on the scene.\"\\n\\n \"So can I call you Peacock?\" I teased.\\n\\n \"That depends: do you want to feel safe while you sleep at…\" Macey started, but then two elderly women wearing the biggest sunflowers I have ever seen passed us, and Macey smiled at them—yes, actual smileage—and said, \"Well, doesn\u0027t the Kansas delegation look festive!\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/don-t-judge-a-girl-by-her-cover-gallagher-girls-3/page-1.html","bookId":2748,"book":{"id":2748,"title":"Don\u0027t Judge a Girl by Her Cover (Gallagher Girls #3)","description":"Storyline: Don\u0027t Judge a Girl by Her Cover (Gallagher Girls #3) \\n When Cammie \"The Chameleon\" Morgan visits her roommate Macey in Boston, she thinks she\u0027s in for an exciting end to her summer break.
