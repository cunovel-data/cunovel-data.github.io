{"id":83153,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"\"Covert operations.\" Mr. Solomon walked through a set of large double doors into a room twice as large as the library in the mansion above us. As in the library, a second-story walkway circled the room, and old-fashioned wooden tables were arranged in a U-like shape across the floor. \"The clandestine service…\" our teacher talked on as the entire junior CoveOps class rushed to claim seats. \"It\u0027s a life of being where you\u0027re not supposed to be—of doing what you\u0027re not supposed to do.\" There was a wooden chair at the front of the room, but instead of sitting, he gripped the back of it with both hands. It was the first thing about Covert Operations that felt familiar. \"It means getting in, ladies.\" He searched the room. \"And most important, it means getting out.\" I thought about hotels and laundry chutes, and for a second my head hurt. I felt a little dizzy as our teacher said, \"Exfiltrations are defined by two factors, Ms. Baxter. Name them.\" \"They take place in hostile territory,\" Bex said. \"Correct,\" Mr. Solomon replied, taking a step. He wrote Bex\u0027s response on an ancient rolling chalkboard at the front of the room. \"That\u0027s one qualifier of an exfiltration. Ms. Fetterman, what\u0027s two?\" As we waited for Anna\u0027s response, I heard the chalk against the board. Everything was louder here, especially the clear bright voice that said, \"No one ever knows about it.\" Every head turned. I\u0027ve never seen anyone command a room more effortlessly than Aunt Abby did when she said, \"You rang, Joe?\" Oh. My. Gosh. Maybe it was the spy in me … or the girl in me … or the niece in me … but when Aunt Abby placed her hand on her hip, I could have sworn she was doing something that I hadn\u0027t thought any Gallagher Girl would ever dare to do: flirt with Joe Solomon! \"Agent Cameron,\" Mr. Solomon said. \"So glad you could join us. The junior class…\" He gestured toward us. Aunt Abby waved two fingers. \"Hi, girls.\" \"…and I were just getting ready to discuss exfiltration operations.\" He dropped the chalk into the tray and slapped his hands together twice. \"Thought you might lend a unique perspective to that topic.\" \"Oh, Mr. Solomon,\" Abby said with a smile, \"you do know how to show a girl a good time.\" She walked around the U of desks, scanning the walls, the cases of books, everything about Sublevel Two; and I realized that while I was seeing it for the first time, my aunt was seeing it again after a long time. I wondered if it might look different in the light of everything she\u0027d learned since leaving. \"As I was saying,\" Mr. Solomon went on, \"exfiltrations are critical. And they\u0027re hard—\" \"Especially in Istanbul,\" Aunt Abby added softly, and our teacher laughed. It sounded like an inside joke, except spies don\u0027t make inside jokes! There\u0027s too much information \"inside,\" and so that\u0027s where we keep it. But the craziest thing wasn\u0027t that Aunt Abby had made a joke. … It wasn\u0027t even that she was flirting. The craziest thing was that I was pretty sure that smiling and laughing were Mr. Solomon\u0027s way of flirting back! There we were, in a cavern of stone and secrets, and yet it felt like my aunt had brought the sun in with her, illuminating a side of my teacher that I had never seen. For the first time in weeks, my head didn\u0027t hurt. Boston was just a city in Massachusetts. I might have been content to sit like that all day—all week. All year. But then the lights went out. At the back of the room an old-fashioned projector came to life, and an image was slicing through the dark. \"I\u0027m sure you\u0027ve all seen this before,\" Mr. Solomon said. But I hadn\u0027t seen it. A chill ran through me as I realized…I\u0027d lived it. The entire class seemed to hold its breath while the film cut between different angles, different cameras, different news crews. Parts of the footage had been shown in an almost continual loop on every TV in the country for days, but as with most things we Gallagher Girls do, there was a lot more to the story, and that day we were seeing the uncensored version. \"What I\u0027m about to show you is a nearly textbook example of a daylight exfiltration operation in an occupied area.\" I thought Mr. Solomon would look at me. I expected my aunt to ask if I was okay. I wanted someone to acknowledge that it wasn\u0027t a lesson—it was the hardest day of my life. But the only change in our teacher\u0027s voice was a sudden pause before he added, \"Lucky for us, it didn\u0027t work.\" And then I knew that we weren\u0027t there to study what Macey and I had done right. We weren\u0027t the seasoned professional operatives on the roof that day. We were just two girls who got lucky, and luck\u0027s not a skill that anyone can learn. Dust kept dancing in the projector\u0027s light. At no point did anyone say, \"If this is too much for you, Cammie, you can leave\" or \"Ms. Morgan, what were you thinking there?\" I was just another girl in the room, not the girl on the roof. The sounds were different there—just the buzz of my instructor\u0027s voice. The answering of questions. The muffled shouts of the camera operators as they jockeyed for position. But in my head I saw the whirl of circling blades. I heard the grunts and kicks, the distant roar of the wind coming in off the harbor. In my mind, the film was clearer and slower as Preston fell to safety. And then I watched a masked figure ignore the son of a potential president, point to my best friend, and say the two words I hadn\u0027t truly heard before. The room was dark. The walls around us were thick. And I\u0027m pretty sure my aunt was the only person who heard me whisper, \"Get her.\" Chapter Ten There are things spies often carry with them: pocket litter, fake IDs, the occasional weapon-slash-camera-slash-hair accessory. But the heaviest things, I think, are the secrets. They can drown you if they let them. As I sat inside Sublevel Two that day, I knew the one I held was so heavy I might never see the surface again. When class was over, the lights came on, and I listened as half of my classmates scattered to explore their new surroundings. I watched Mick Morrison corner Mr. Solomon with a dozen questions about the Marciano Theory and its proper use in urban settings, but the rest of the class stood huddled around Aunt Abby, who was doing a very dramatic reenactment of the time she\u0027d had to sneak a nuclear engineer out of Taiwan during the rainy season. \"So then I told him, I know it\u0027s a rickshaw, but that doesn\u0027t mean it doesn\u0027t float!\" Abby said. Tina and Eva burst out laughing, but I knew Aunt Abby was watching out of the corner of her eyes as I left the classroom and started up the long spiraling ramp that led to the mansion above us. I knew she was listening as Bex fell into step beside me and said, \"Cam, slow down,\" as if it were possible for me to outpace her. (Which it isn\u0027t.) But I just kept spiraling upward, remembering the words I had listened to but hadn\u0027t heard; recalling the attackers\u0027 indifference when Preston fell to safety over the side of the roof—the things I had watched but hadn\u0027t seen. \"I was an idiot!\" I snapped. \"You were brilliant,\" Bex said, and from any other girl in any other school those words might have sounded like lip service. But not this girl. Not this school. From Bex, it was an undisputed fact, and she was willing to take on anyone who said otherwise. \"Two girls in this school could have done what you did,\" She cocked an eyebrow. \"And you\u0027re the other one.\" As we reached the elevators and stepped inside, I thought about how there are two types of secrets: the kind you want to keep in, and the kind you don\u0027t dare to let out. I could have looked at Bex. I could have lowered my voice, and there, in that tiny elevator a hundred feet beneath the ground, I could have been certain that no one could possibly overhear. But my mother and Mr. Solomon were the two best spies I know, and they hadn\u0027t told Macey. They hadn\u0027t told me. As the elevator doors slid open, I heard the sound of girls coming down the stairs above us. The smell of lunch drifted from the Grand Hall. Things move through our mansion as fast as fire sometimes. And that\u0027s when I knew I had the second type of secret. I didn\u0027t dare to set it free. Instead I carried it into the Grand Hall and sat down at the juniors\u0027 table for lunch, barely looking up until I heard Eva Alvarez announce, \"Mail\u0027s here,\" She dropped a postcard on the table in front of me, and immediately I recognized the ruby slippers from the National Museum of American History and The Wizard of Oz and, most important, from the very place where Zach and I had first seen each other for what we really were. This isn\u0027t a hallucination, I told myself. This is real, I thought as I turned it over and studied the handwriting that, last spring, I\u0027d watched wash away in the rain. And I read the words \"Be careful.\" I spent the rest of that week trying to talk to Aunt Abby alone, but the problem was, from that point on, my aunt was never alone. \"Um, Aunt Abby, can we…talk?\" I asked Monday night after supper, but Abby just smiled and started for the door. Unfortunately, half the sophomore class started with her. \"Sure, squirt. I was just going to go to teach these guys this really cool move with a garden hose. Wanna come?\" When I saw her in the foyer Tuesday afternoon, I asked, \"Hey, Aunt Abby, do you maybe have some time to…catch up…tonight?\" \"Ooh, sorry, Camster,\" she told me as she started walking Macey to P\u0026E. \"Fibs has asked me to help him whip up a batch of this superpowerful coma-inducing cream I learned how to make in the Amazon. It could take all night.\" Everywhere I turned I heard questions like, \"Hey, Cammie, has Abby ever shown you that thing she did in Portugal with a bobby pin?\" Or \"Well, I heard that five more senior operatives were begging to take Macey\u0027s detail, but the deputy director of the CIA himself called and asked Abby to take the job.\" By Saturday, it was starting to feel like the one story Aunt Abby wouldn\u0027t tell was the only one I wanted to hear. And, by Sunday, it had started to rain. The halls seemed dimmer than usual for that early in the semester as I walked through the empty corridors on my way to my mother\u0027s office. When I passed the window seat on the second floor, I couldn\u0027t resist pulling back the red velvet curtains and peering through the wavy glass. Heavy gray clouds hung low in the sky, but the trees were lush and green in the forest. Our walls were still tall and strong, and beyond them, not a single news van sat. I thought for a second that maybe the worst of it was over, but then a flash of lightning slashed through the sky, and I knew the storm was just beginning. \"Cammie!\" Mom\u0027s voice called through the Hall of History, and I turned away from the glass. Walking toward my mother\u0027s office, I couldn\u0027t help notice that she was smiling as if this were exactly how the first Sunday night after summer vacation was supposed to be—except this time it was definitely different. Because first, there was music. Loud music. Fast music. Music that was definitely not of the Culture and Assimilation variety! And second, the food didn\u0027t smell terrible. Sure, it didn\u0027t smell as good as the aromas drifting from the Grand Hall, but it didn\u0027t look like the smoke (and/or hazardous materials) detectors had gone off yet, and that was a very good sign.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/don-t-judge-a-girl-by-her-cover-gallagher-girls-3/page-9.html","bookId":2748,"book":{"id":2748,"title":"Don\u0027t Judge a Girl by Her Cover (Gallagher Girls #3)","description":"Storyline: Don\u0027t Judge a Girl by Her Cover (Gallagher Girls #3) When Cammie \"The Chameleon\" Morgan visits her roommate Macey in Boston, she thinks she\u0027s in for an exciting end to her summer break.
