As we stepped toward the roof\u0027s edge and peered out across the city, we saw historic church steeples and towering skyscrapers. Some buildings looked as if Paul Revere himself were going to step outside; others seemed straight out of the future. Sixty stories below, news vans and tour busses stood on the gridlocked highways, but on the hotel\u0027s roof the chaos of the convention seemed to be far, far away. And that, I guess, was the problem.\n There were no camera crews, no public relations specialists. I glanced at Macey, who said what I was thinking. \"This isn\u0027t right.\" Then she turned to Preston. \"Where were we supposed to be, exactly?\" Macey looked from Preston to her well-worn agenda, and then she finally held out her hand. \"Let me see your itinerary.\"\n \"Okay, yeah…see that\u0027s not so easy to…\" Preston stumbled for words and then admitted, \"My mom has it.\"\n I looked behind us, searching for Charlie, but the man was nowhere to be seen, and in that moment, everything seemed to change.\n Maybe it was my four full years of training, or my sixteen- and-a-half years of being Rachel Morgan\u0027s daughter, but somehow, some way, I knew that rooftop was a very bad place to be.\n \"Hey, you\u0027re\"—Preston started as I ran toward the heavy metal door—\"a really fast runner.\"\n But I barely heard him as I pulled with all my might against the door, trying the handle in vain, banging against the gray metal. It was locked—or jammed—and there was no leaving the way we\u0027d come.\n \"This isn\u0027t right,\" Macey said behind me, double- checking her itinerary, still so entrenched in the part of herself that was a politician\u0027s daughter that she was ignoring the other part—the spy part—the girl she thought she wouldn\u0027t get to be during her summer vacation.\n \"Something\u0027s just not…\" but then she trailed off. Macey\u0027s blue eyes stared into mine. I saw in them a realization—a fear—as she looked down at the paper in her hands and then back at me…\n And then toward the helicopter that was flying too low, too fast, and heading right for us.\n Chapter Three\n Here\u0027s the thing about covert operations: the really bad things always happen when you least expect them. The bad guys don\u0027t give you a heads-up when you\u0027re going to be attacked. They don\u0027t let you wait thirty minutes after eating. And they never, ever let you stop to put on comfortable shoes.\n So training for that kind of life means one thing: spy school is never really out of session.\n I thought about the piece of paper in Macey\u0027s hands and told myself that it could have been an innocent mistake, a change of plans. It didn\u0027t mean that our teachers had intentionally drawn Macey—and by extension, me—onto a roof with some kind of terrible test in mind. It didn\u0027t mean we had a fight coming. It didn\u0027t mean my heart had reason to race.\n But still I looked at my roommate and asked, \"Are you thinking what I\u0027m thinking?\"\n Macey shrugged. \"Our teachers wouldn\u0027t do anything in front of him.\" She gestured to Preston, who was leaning over the railing, staring down at the chaos on the street below, completely oblivious to the dark spot that was on the horizon and moving in fast.\n I thought about Preston\u0027s missing itinerary. \"Maybe he wasn\u0027t supposed to be here?\"\n And with that, Macey let her piece of paper fall; I saw it flit and float in the air, and swirl around us as the chopper hovered lower. It was as if Macey had let her cover fall as well. The hotel was full of people who would only see the candidate\u0027s daughter, but right then—right there—there was no doubt who Macey McHenry had to be.\n \"Hey, you guys, look at—\" Preston said, finally noticing the helicopter above us. He stopped suddenly as a rope fell from the chopper and dangled between sky and roof.\n I heard a click, a metallic creak as the door to the roof opened. But instead of Charlie, two masked figures stepped into the glaring sun. And then I couldn\u0027t help myself; I screamed, \"I\u0027m on summer vacation!\"\n I felt Macey at my back, saw Preston staring at a dark figure rappelling from the helicopter as if he\u0027d somehow stumbled into a video game—or a nightmare. \"They don\u0027t look like undecided voters,\" he said, as if sarcasm were a weapon he\u0027d relied on his entire life and he really didn\u0027t want it to fail him then.\n The masked figures didn\u0027t rush toward us. They weren\u0027t sloppy. They were deliberate. They were good, moving with purpose, keeping an even spacing as Macey and I stood\n back-to-back, bracing ourselves in the center of the roof.\n \"Preston!\" I yelled. \"Get down!\"\n I wanted him to hide. I wanted him to be unconscious or blind. I wanted him anywhere but there. I already knew too well how having a civilian boy in the middle of a CoveOps exercise can turn out. It was a chapter I didn\u0027t need to read again.\n \"This isn\u0027t\"—I said with a grunt as I parried the attacker\u0027s first blow—\"a very\"—I took a half-step to my right and landed a kick at one of the masked men\u0027s knees—\"good time for me!\"\n A masked man stood in front of me. Blazing white teeth shone behind his dark mask. For a split second I thought it was the smile of Mr. Solomon. The first attacker who had come from the chopper had the unmistakable curves of a beautiful woman, and a part of me wondered if it was my mom.\n But then from nowhere I felt a punch in my side, a perfect blow, and as I fell onto the sticky tar-covered roof, I saw news choppers beginning to swoop and swarm around us—and I knew.\n I knew no one at the Gallagher Academy would be this careless.\n I knew my mother and Mr. Solomon would rather die than risk exposure of our school on this kind of stage.\n I knew there was something more behind the punch— not in the attacker\u0027s fist, but in his eyes.\n And then, more than ever, I knew I had to get Macey and Preston off the roof.\n I don\u0027t know how to explain what happened next, but in that instant, all the P\u0026E lessons I\u0027d ever had came back to me. In that moment, I knew surviving wasn\u0027t just about punches and kicks; it\u0027s about geometry and it\u0027s about timing; it\u0027s about having your reflexes speed up while your mind slows down.\n Maybe it lasted a minute; maybe it lasted a month. All I really know for sure is that one of the men moved toward me. I ducked as his fist flew, narrowly missing my head, and yet my focus was already somewhere else—my eyes were scanning the roof, looking for a weapon, a way out, or both. And that\u0027s when I saw it—a narrow window washer\u0027s plank dangling off the side of the roof. It had rails on both sides and was attached to a pulley system.\n My heart pounded. The wind roared in my ears as I grabbed Preston\u0027s hand and screamed, \"Come on!\"\n There were footsteps behind me—a hand on my arm. I spun around, but before I could land a blow, Preston pulled back his free hand and punched the man in the throat. It was a perfect lucky shot, but I was willing to take any help I could get as I pulled the potential first son out of harm\u0027s way and onto the narrow plank.\n \"I hit a guy,\" Preston said, staring at his fist as if that were the most shocking thing of all.\n \"I know. Good job,\" I said, reaching for the controls; but then for the first time Preston seemed to notice that I had guided him onto something that was dangling off the side of a sixty-story-building.\n \"Wait!\" he shouted.\n \"You\u0027ll be fine,\" I told him.\n \"But shouldn\u0027t I…\" he muttered in the manner of a boy who knows he should be chivalrous but doesn\u0027t quite know how.\n Behind me, I heard Macey cry out in pain, but I kept my focus and hit the green button, knowing somehow that getting Preston off that roof was my mission at that moment.\n \"Hang on!\" I yelled, and in the next instant gravity took over and Preston dropped twenty stories to safety.\n I might have savored that fact, but the attackers seemed to refocus, and I watched the woman raise her hand and point to where Macey was taking her place by my side.\n \"Get her,\" the woman ordered. I stole a sideways glance at my friend, the daughter of a United States senator and one of the wealthiest women in the world. My friend, who had been featured on every newsstand in America. My friend, who would be any kidnapper\u0027s dream.\n Macey and I were retreating slowly, coming closer and closer to the wall behind us, and I knew we were cornered.\n \"No,\" I cried, as if that was all it would take for them to stop.\n And then I saw it—a rusty vent ten feet to the right of the door I\u0027d given up any hope of opening. I dropped to the ground, kicked the vent as hard as I could, and felt it give slightly. I kicked again while, behind me, the men lunged for Macey. I heard a sickening snap. I turned and saw my roommate clutch her arm and fall to the ground, howling out in pain, so I kicked harder, and this time the old vent buckled under the pressure. It popped free, and I hurled it toward the head of one of the men who was reaching for Macey. I heard the crash of metal against skull, but I didn\u0027t stop to survey the damage—I was too busy grabbing Macey and pushing her toward the hole in the wall that the vent had left.\n I started to follow, but someone grasped my shoulders with a steel grip holding me to the spot. I clawed against her; but as I tried to pry myself free, my hand brushed against a gold ring engraved with an emblem that I could have sworn I\u0027d seen before. For a split second my mind went still as I tried to place it, but then I heard a frail voice say \"Cam,\" and I remembered my friend—my mission.\n I clawed harder, leaning forward, praying that my momentum would take me through the gap in the wall to a safer place. Suddenly, I remembered the Winters McHenry campaign button on my blouse. I heard my shirt rip as I pulled the button free and jabbed the pin into the hand on my left shoulder.\n The woman behind me howled in pain as I pushed Macey all the way through the vent and followed after her.\n \"Run, Macey!\" I screamed. \"Go!\"\n I wasn\u0027t thinking. No strategies came to mind. No flash cards. No vocabulary words. It was the age-old case of fight versus flight. I looked at Macey, whose arm hung at a strange angle; I felt my side and knew my ribs were bruised at best and maybe broken, and I knew that fight wouldn\u0027t be an option much longer—that we had to get out of there and soon.\n \"Go,\" I told her. Behind us, I heard the metal door open again. A flash of light sliced across the cement floor, illuminating a pair of long legs bent at an odd angle, protruding from behind one of the room\u0027s massive machines.\n I heard Macey whisper, \"Charlie.\"\n We pushed past the churning machines and skirted a decade\u0027s worth of broken furniture and hotel relics until we reached the elevator that had brought us there.\n And then for the first time, I honestly felt like I could\n cry.\n The elevator\u0027s doors stood open. Mangled wires protruded from the control box, still sparking where they\u0027d been pulled out of the wall and sliced in two with professional precision.\n There was no place we could run. No place we could hide. I turned to look at the three figures, approaching us in perfect formation—a hunting party with a helicopter ready to take my friend to someplace I didn\u0027t dare imagine.\n I glanced around for a weapon, found a rolling cart and pushed it toward them with all my might, hoping it might serve as the greatest bowling ball in history and knock the black-clad figures down in one swipe. But the man in front merely tossed it aside. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/don-t-judge-a-girl-by-her-cover-gallagher-girls-3/page-3.html","bookId":2748,"book":{"id":2748,"title":"Don\u0027t Judge a Girl by Her Cover (Gallagher Girls #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Don\u0027t Judge a Girl by Her Cover (Gallagher Girls #3) \n When Cammie \"The Chameleon\" Morgan visits her roommate Macey in Boston, she thinks she\u0027s in for an exciting end to her summer break.
