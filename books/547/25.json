{"id":20316,"no":25,"title":"Chapter 28 A PILGRIM, AN OUTLAW: THE SPIRIT DETAINED","content":"The cab had not travelled a short block before Carrie, settling herself and thoroughly waking in the night atmosphere, asked: \"What\u0027s the matter with him? Is he hurt badly?\" \"It isn\u0027t anything very serious,\" Hurstwood said solemnly. He was very much disturbed over his own situation, and now that he had Carrie with him, he only wanted to get safely out of reach of the law. Therefore he was in no mood for anything save such words as would further his plans distinctly. Carrie did not forget that there was something to be settled between her and Hurstwood, but the thought was ignored in her agitation. The one thing was to finish this strange pilgrimage. \"Where is he?\" \"Way out on the South Side,\" said Hurstwood. \"We\u0027ll have to take the train. It\u0027s the quickest way.\" Carrie said nothing, and the horse gambolled on. The weirdness of the city by night held her attention. She looked at the long receding rows of lamps and studied the dark, silent houses. \"How did he hurt himself?\" she asked -- meaning what was the nature of his injuries. Hurstwood understood. He hated to lie any more than necessary, and yet he wanted no protests until he was out of danger. \"I don\u0027t know exactly,\" he said. \"They just called me up to go and get you and bring you out. They said there wasn\u0027t any need for alarm, but that I shouldn\u0027t fail to bring you.\" The man\u0027s serious manner convinced Carrie, and she became silent, wondering. Hurstwood examined his watch and urged the man to hurry. For one in so delicate a position he was exceedingly cool. He could only think of how needful it was to make the train and get quietly away. Carrie seemed quite tractable, and he congratulated himself. In due time they reached the depot, and after helping her out he handed the man a five-dollar bill and hurried on. \"You wait here,\" he said to Carrie, when they reached the waiting-room, \"while I get the tickets.\" \"Have I much time to catch the train for Detroit?\" he asked of the agent. \"Four minutes,\" said the latter. He paid for two tickets as circumspectly as possible. \"Is it far?\" said Carrie, as he hurried back. \"Not very,\" he said. \"We must get right in.\" He pushed her before him at the gate, stood between her and the ticket man while the latter punched their tickets, so that she could not see, and then hurried after. There was a long line of express and passenger cars and one or two common day coaches. As the train had only recently been made up and few passengers were expected, there were only one or two brakemen waiting. They entered the rear day coach and sat down. Almost immediately, \"All aboard,\" resounded faintly from the outside, and the train started. Carrie began to think it was a little bit curious -- this going to a depot -- but said nothing. The whole incident was so out of the natural that she did not attach too much weight to anything she imagined. \"How have you been?\" asked Hurstwood gently, for he now breathed easier. \"Very well,\" said Carrie, who was so disturbed that she could not bring a proper attitude to bear in the matter. She was still nervous to reach Drouet and see what could be the matter. Hurstwood contemplated her and felt this. He was not disturbed that it should be so. He did not trouble because she was moved sympathetically in the matter. It was one of the qualities in her which pleased him exceedingly. He was only thinking how he should explain. Even this was not the most serious thing in his mind, however. His own deed and present flight were the great shadows which weighed upon him. \"What a fool I was to do that,\" he said over and over. \"What a mistake!\" In his sober senses, he could scarcely realise that the thing had been done. He could not begin to feel that he was a fugitive from justice. He had often read of such things, and had thought they must be terrible, but now that the thing was upon him, he only sat and looked into the past. The future was a thing which concerned the Canadian line. He wanted to reach that. As for the rest, he surveyed his actions for the evening, and counted them parts of a great mistake. \"Still,\" he said, \"what could I have done?\" Then he would decide to make the best of it, and would begin to do so by starting the whole inquiry over again. It was a fruitless, harassing round, and left him in a queer mood to deal with the proposition he had in the presence of Carrie. The train clacked through the yards along the lake front, and ran rather slowly to Twenty-fourth Street. Brakes and signals were visible without. The engine gave short calls with its whistle, and frequently the bell rang. Several brakemen came through, bearing lanterns. They were locking the vestibules and putting the cars in order for a long run. Presently it began to gain speed, and Carrie saw the silent streets flashing by in rapid succession. The engine also began its whistle-calls of four parts, with which it signalled danger to important crossings. \"Is it very far?\" asked Carrie. \"Not so very,\" said Hurstwood. He could hardly repress a smile at her simplicity. He wanted to explain and conciliate her, but he also wanted to be well out of Chicago. In the lapse of another half-hour it became apparent to Carrie that it was quite a run to wherever he was taking her, anyhow. \"Is it in Chicago?\" she asked nervously. They were now far beyond the city limits, and the train was scudding across the Indiana line at a great rate. \"No,\" he said, \"not where we are going.\" There was something in the way he said this which aroused her in an instant. Her pretty brow began to contract. \"We are going to see Charlie, aren\u0027t we?\" she asked. He felt that the time was up. An explanation might as well come now as later. Therefore, he shook his head in the most gentle negative. \"What?\" said Carrie. She was nonplussed at the possibility of the errand being different from what she had thought. He only looked at her in the most kindly and mollifying way. \"Well, where are you taking me, then?\" she asked, her voice showing the quality of fright. \"I\u0027ll tell you, Carrie, if you\u0027ll be quiet. I want you to come along with me to another city.\" \"Oh,\" said Carrie, her voice rising into a weak cry. \"Let me off. I don\u0027t want to go with you.\" She was quite appalled at the man\u0027s audacity. This was something which had never for a moment entered her head. Her one thought now was to get off and away. If only the flying train could be stopped, the terrible trick would be amended. She arose and tried to push out into the aisle -- anywhere. She knew she had to do something. Hurstwood laid a gentle hand on her. \"Sit still, Carrie,\" he said. \"Sit still. It won\u0027t do you any good to get up here. Listen to me and I\u0027ll tell you what I\u0027ll do. Wait a moment.\" She was pushing at his knees, but he only pulled her back. No one saw this little altercation, for very few persons were in the car, and they were attempting to doze. \"I won\u0027t,\" said Carrie, who was, nevertheless, complying against her will. \"Let me go,\" she said. \"How dare you?\" and large tears began to gather in her eyes. Hurstwood was now fully aroused to the immediate difficulty, and ceased to think of his own situation. He must do something with this girl, or she would cause him trouble. He tried the art of persuasion with all his powers aroused. \"Look here now, Carrie,\" he said, \"you mustn\u0027t act this way. I didn\u0027t mean to hurt your feelings. I don\u0027t want to do anything to make you feel bad.\" \"Oh,\" sobbed Carrie, \"oh, oh -- oo -- o!\" \"There, there,\" he said, \"you mustn\u0027t cry. Won\u0027t you listen to me? Listen to me a minute, and I\u0027ll tell you why I came to do this thing. I couldn\u0027t help it. I assure you I couldn\u0027t. Won\u0027t you listen?\" Her sobs disturbed him so that he was quite sure she did not hear a word he said. \"Won\u0027t you listen?\" he asked. \"No, I won\u0027t,\" said Carrie, flashing up. \"I want you to take me out of this, or I\u0027ll tell the conductor. I won\u0027t go with you. It\u0027s a shame,\" and again sobs of fright cut off her desire for expression. Hurstwood listened with some astonishment. He felt that she had just cause for feeling as she did, and yet he wished that he could straighten this thing out quickly. Shortly the conductor would come through for the tickets. He wanted no noise, no trouble of any kind. Before everything he must make her quiet. \"You couldn\u0027t get out until the train stops again,\" said Hurstwood. \"It won\u0027t be very long until we reach another station. You can get out then if you want to. I won\u0027t stop you. All I want you to do is to listen a moment. You\u0027ll let me tell you, won\u0027t you?\" Carrie seemed not to listen. She only turned her head toward the window, where outside all was black. The train was speeding with steady grace across the fields and through patches of wood. The long whistles came with sad, musical effect as the lonely woodland crossings were approached. Now the conductor entered the car and took up the one or two fares that had been added at Chicago. He approached Hurstwood, who handed out the tickets. Poised as she was to act, Carrie made no move. She did not look about. When the conductor had gone again Hurstwood felt relieved. \"You\u0027re angry at me because I deceived you,\" he said. \"I didn\u0027t mean to, Carrie. As I live I didn\u0027t. I couldn\u0027t help it. I couldn\u0027t stay away from you after the first time I saw you.\" He was ignoring the last deception as something that might go by the board. He wanted to convince her that his wife could no longer be a factor in their relationship. The money he had stolen he tried to shut out of his mind. \"Don\u0027t talk to me,\" said Carrie, \"I hate you. I want you to go away from me. I am going to get out at the very next station.\" She was in a tremble of excitement and opposition as she spoke. \"All right,\" he said, \"but you\u0027ll hear me out, won\u0027t you? After all you have said about loving me, you might hear me. I don\u0027t want to do you any harm. I\u0027ll give you the money to go back with when you go. I merely want to tell you, Carrie. You can\u0027t stop me from loving you, whatever you may think.\" He looked at her tenderly, but received no reply. \"You think I have deceived you badly, but I haven\u0027t. I didn\u0027t do it willingly. I\u0027m through with my wife. She hasn\u0027t any claims on me. I\u0027ll never see her any more. That\u0027s why I\u0027m here to-night. That\u0027s why I came and got you.\" \"You said Charlie was hurt,\" said Carrie, savagely. \"You deceived me. You\u0027ve been deceiving me all the time, and now you want to force me to run away with you.\" She was so excited that she got up and tried to get by him again. He let her, and she took another seat. Then he followed. \"Don\u0027t run away from me, Carrie,\" he said gently. \"Let me explain. If you will only hear me out you will see where I stand. I tell you my wife is nothing to me. She hasn\u0027t been anything for years or I wouldn\u0027t have ever come near you. I\u0027m going to get a divorce just as soon as I can. I\u0027ll never see her again. I\u0027m done with all that. You\u0027re the only person I want. If I can have you I won\u0027t ever think of another woman again.\" Carrie heard all this in a very ruffled state. It sounded sincere enough, however, despite all he had done. There was a tenseness in Hurstwood\u0027s voice and manner which could but have some effect. She did not want anything to do with him. He was married, he had deceived her once, and now again, and she thought him terrible. Still there is something in such daring and power which is fascinating to a woman, especially if she can be made to feel that it is all prompted by love of her. The progress of the train was having a great deal to do with the solution of this difficult situation. The speeding wheels and disappearing country put Chicago farther and farther behind. Carrie could feel that she was being borne a long distance off -- that the engine was making an almost through run to some distant city. She felt at times as if she could cry out and make such a row that some one would come to her aid; at other times it seemed an almost useless thing -- so far was she from any aid, no matter what she did. All the while Hurstwood was endeavouring to formulate his plea in such a way that it would strike home and bring her into sympathy with him. \"I was simply put where I didn\u0027t know what else to do.\" Carrie deigned no suggestion of hearing this. \"When I saw you wouldn\u0027t come unless I could marry you, I decided to put everything else behind me and get you to come away with me. I\u0027m going off now to another city. I want to go to Montreal for a while, and then anywhere you want to. We\u0027ll go and live in New York, if you say.\" \"I\u0027ll not have anything to do with you,\" said Carrie. \"I want to get off this train. Where are we going?\" \"To Detroit,\" said Hurstwood. \"Oh!\" said Carrie, in a burst of anguish. So distant and definite a point seemed to increase the difficulty. \"Won\u0027t you come along with me?\" he said, as if there was great danger that she would not. \"You won\u0027t need to do anything but travel with me. I\u0027ll not trouble you in any way. You can see Montreal and New York, and then if you don\u0027t want to stay you can go back. It will be better than trying to go back to-night.\" The first gleam of fairness shone in this proposition for Carrie. It seemed a plausible thing to do, much as she feared his opposition if she tried to carry it out. Montreal and New York! Even now she was speeding toward those great, strange lands, and could see them if she liked. She thought, but made no sign. Hurstwood thought he saw a shade of compliance in this. He redoubled his ardour. \"Think,\" he said, \"what I\u0027ve given up. I can\u0027t go back to Chicago any more. I\u0027ve got to stay away and live alone now, if you don\u0027t come with me. You won\u0027t go back on me entirely, will you, Carrie?\" \"I don\u0027t want you to talk to me,\" she answered forcibly. Hurstwood kept silent for a while. Carrie felt the train to be slowing down. It was the moment to act if she was to act at all. She stirred uneasily. \"Don\u0027t think of going, Carrie,\" he said. \"If you ever cared for me at all, come along and let\u0027s start right. I\u0027ll do whatever you say. I\u0027ll marry you, or I\u0027ll let you go back. Give yourself time to think it over. I wouldn\u0027t have wanted you to come if I hadn\u0027t loved you. I tell you, Carrie, before God, I can\u0027t live without you. I won\u0027t!\" There was the tensity of fierceness in the man\u0027s plea which appealed deeply to her sympathies. It was a dissolving fire which was actuating him now. He was loving her too intensely to think of giving her up in this, his hour of distress. He clutched her hand nervously and pressed it with all the force of an appeal. The train was now all but stopped. It was running by some cars on a side track. Everything outside was dark and dreary. A few sprinkles on the window began to indicate that it was raining. Carrie hung in a quandary, balancing between decision and helplessness. Now the train stopped, and she was listening to his plea. The engine backed a few feet and all was still. She wavered, totally unable to make a move. Minute after minute slipped by and still she hesitated, he pleading. \"Will you let me come back if I want to?\" she asked, as if she now had the upper hand and her companion was utterly subdued. \"Of course,\" he answered, \"you know I will.\" Carrie only listened as one who has granted a temporary amnesty. She began to feel as if the matter were in her hands entirely. The train was again in rapid motion. Hurstwood changed the subject. \"Aren\u0027t you very tired?\" he said. \"No,\" she answered. \"Won\u0027t you let me get you a berth in the sleeper?\" She shook her head, though for all her distress and his trickery she was beginning to notice what she had always felt -- his thoughtfulness. \"Oh, yes,\" he said, \"you will feel so much better.\" She shook her head. \"Let me fix my coat for you, anyway,\" and he arose and arranged his light coat in a comfortable position to receive her head. \"There,\" he said tenderly, \"now see if you can\u0027t rest a little.\" He could have kissed her for her compliance. He took his seat beside her and thought a moment. \"I believe we\u0027re in for a heavy rain,\" he said. \"So it looks,\" said Carrie, whose nerves were quieting under the sound of the rain drops, driven by a gusty wind, as the train swept on frantically through the shadow to a newer world. The fact that he had in a measure mollified Carrie was a source of satisfaction to Hurstwood, but it furnished only the most temporary relief. Now that her opposition was out of the way, he had all of his time to devote to the consideration of his own error. His condition was bitter in the extreme, for he did not want the miserable sum he had stolen. He did not want to be a thief. That sum or any other could never compensate for the state which he had thus foolishly doffed. It could not give him back his host of friends, his name, his house and family, nor Carrie, as he had meant to have her. He was shut out from Chicago -- from his easy, comfortable state. He had robbed himself of his dignity, his merry meetings, his pleasant evenings. And for what? The more he thought of it the more unbearable it became. He began to think that he would try and restore himself to his old state. He would return the miserable thievings of the night and explain. Perhaps Moy would understand. Perhaps they would forgive him and let him come back. By noontime the train rolled into Detroit and he began to feel exceedingly nervous. The police must be on his track by now. They had probably notified all the police of the big cities, and detectives would be watching for him. He remembered instances in which defaulters had been captured. Consequently, he breathed heavily and paled somewhat. His hands felt as if they must have something to do. He simulated interest in several scenes without which he did not feel. He repeatedly beat his foot upon the floor. Carrie noticed his agitation, but said nothing. She had no idea what it meant or that it was important. He wondered now why he had not asked whether this train went on through to Montreal or some Canadian point. Perhaps he could have saved time. He jumped up and sought the conductor. \"Does any part of this train go to Montreal?\" he asked. \"Yes, the next sleeper back does.\" He would have asked more, but it did not seem wise, so he decided to inquire at the depot. The train rolled into the yards, clanging and puffing. \"I think we had better go right on through to Montreal,\" he said to Carrie. \"I\u0027ll see what the connections are when we get off.\" He was exceedingly nervous, but did his best to put on a calm exterior. Carrie only looked at him with large, troubled eyes. She was drifting mentally, unable to say to herself what to do. The train stopped and Hurstwood led the way out. He looked warily around him, pretending to look after Carrie. Seeing nothing that indicated studied observation, he made his way to the ticket office. \"The next train for Montreal leaves when?\" he asked. \"In twenty minutes,\" said the man. He bought two tickets and Pullman berths. Then he hastened back to Carrie. \"We go right out again,\" he said, scarcely noticing that Carrie looked tired and weary. \"I wish I was out of all this,\" she exclaimed gloomily. \"You\u0027ll feel better when we reach Montreal,\" he said. \"I haven\u0027t an earthly thing with me,\" said Carrie; \"not even a handkerchief.\" \"You can buy all you want as soon as you get there, dearest,\" he explained. \"You can call in a dressmaker.\" Now the crier called the train ready and they got on. Hurstwood breathed a sigh of relief as it started. There was a short run to the river, and there they were ferried over. They had barely pulled the train off the ferry-boat when he settled back with a sigh. \"It won\u0027t be so very long now,\" he said, remembering her in his relief. \"We get there the first thing in the morning.\" Carrie scarcely deigned to reply. \"I\u0027ll see if there is a dining-car,\" he added. \"I\u0027m hungry.\" “不是很重。”赫斯渥神情严肃地说。他被自己的处境弄得心慌意乱，现在既然嘉莉已经在他身边，他只想起安地逃脱法网。因此，除了明显有助于实现他的计划的话以外，他什么也不愿意说。 嘉莉没有忘记，她和赫斯渥之间还有未了结的事，但是她现在很焦虑，也就顾不上想它了。她只想结束这段奇怪的旅程。 “他在哪里？” “在南区，离这里很远，”赫斯渥说。“我们得乘火车去，这样最快。”嘉莉没再说话，马在继续奔跑。夜间城市的古怪景象吸引了她的注意力。她看着那长长的、一排排向后退去的路灯，琢磨着那些黑暗沉默的房屋。 “他怎么受的伤？”她问--意思是到底伤得怎样。赫斯渥懂得她的意思。除非不得已，他不愿意多撒一句谎，但是在他脱险之前，他不想嘉莉有任何抗议。 “具体的我也不知道，”他说。“他们只是叫我来找你，把你带去。他们说没必要惊慌，只是我必须带你去。”这个人的态度严肃，嘉莉相信了他，于是她不再说话，心里犯着嘀咕。 赫斯渥看看表，催车夫再快点。就一个处境如此微妙的人而言，他倒是出奇地冷静。他一心只想着，最重要的是赶上火车，悄悄离开。嘉莉看上去很温顺，他暗自感到庆幸。 他们及时到达了车站，他扶她下车后，递给车夫一张５块的钞票，赶忙进站。 “你等在这里，”到了候车室，他对嘉莉说，“我去买票。”“我能赶上去底特律的火车吗？”他问售票员。 “还有４分钟，”售票员说。 他小心翼翼地付了两张票的钱。 “那地方远吗？”当他匆匆回来时，嘉莉说。 “不太远，”他说。“我们得马上上车。”在进口处，他把她推在前面走。检票员检票时，他站到她和检票员之间，挡住她的视线，然后赶快跟上去。 站内停着一长列快车和客车，还有一两辆普通的硬席客车。因为这班火车是最近新开的，乘客不会多，所以只有一两个列车机务员等在那里。他们上了后面的一辆硬席客车。刚坐下，就听见外面隐约传来叫喊声：“乘客们，请上车！”接着，火车开动了。 嘉莉开始觉得这事有点蹊跷--这样来到一个火车站--但是没有说话。整个这件事情都是这样异常，她对自己心里想的事也就不大重视了。 “你过得好吗？”现在赫斯渥感觉轻松一些了，于是温柔地问道。 “很好，”嘉莉说。她心里很乱，不知道对这件事情该采取什么样的态度才合适。她仍然急着想见到杜洛埃，看看他到底出了什么事。赫斯渥打量着她，感觉到了这一点。但是这并没有令他不安。他并不因为她在这件事上表现出的同情和激动而感到烦恼。这正是她的美德之一，他对此十分欣赏。他只是在考虑该怎么向她解释。然而，在他心中，甚至连这一点也还不是最严重的问题。他自己犯下的事和眼前的逃跑则是沉重地压在他心头的巨大阴影。 “我真傻呀，竟然会做出那种事，”他反复地说，“这是多么大的错误啊！”他现在清醒了，几乎不相信自己真的干了那件事，他无法想象自己成了一个逍遥法外的罪犯。他经常从报上看到这种事，想象着那一定很可怕。可是现在这种事落到了他自己的头上，他却只是坐在这里，缅怀着过去。将来是和加拿大边界连在一起的。他想去那里。至于其它的事，他回顾了一下今晚的所有行动，认为都是一桩大错的组成部分。 “况且，”他说，“我又能怎么做呢？” 于是他决定尽量挽回这件事的影响，为此他又把整个事情考虑了一遍。但是这样反复考虑仍然毫无结果而且令人烦恼，弄得他在面对嘉莉实行自己的计划时，都有些神经兮兮的了。 火车隆隆地穿过湖边的车场，慢慢地朝二十四街驶去。车外的分轨闸和信号灯清晰可见。机车的汽笛发出短促的呜呜声，车铃也不时地响着。几个列车机务员提着灯走过。他们把车厢之间通廊的门锁上，整理好车厢，准备作长途旅行。 很快，火车开始加速，嘉莉看见沉静的街道接连迅速地闪过。机车也开始在过重要的道口时，发出断续四响的汽笛声，作为危险信号。 “那地方很远吗？”嘉莉问。 “不太远，”赫斯渥说。见她如此天真，他都忍不住想笑了。 他想向她解释，安慰她，但是他还是想先远离芝加哥再说。 又过了半个钟头，嘉莉开始明白，他要带她去的地方，不管是哪里，总之是个很远的地方。 “那地方在芝加哥城里吗？”她紧张地问。他们这时早已远离市区范围，火车正飞速越过印第安纳州界。 “不，”他说，“我们去的地方不在芝加哥。”他说这话的口气立刻使她警觉起来。 她那美丽的前额开始皱了起来。 “我们是去看查利，不是吗？”她问。 他觉得是时候了。迟早都要解释，现在就解释也一样。因此，他极其温柔地摇摇头表示否定。 “什么？”嘉莉说。她想到这趟出门与她先前想的可能不一样，一时间不知所措。 他只是用十分体贴和安抚的目光看着她。 “哦，那么，你要带我去哪里？”她问，声音里透着恐惧。 “如果你能安静下来的话，嘉莉，我会告诉你的。我要你跟我一起去另一个城市。”“啊，”嘉莉说，她的声音响了起来，变成了一声柔弱的呼喊。“让我走。我不想跟你去。”这家伙的大胆无礼把她吓坏了。她的头脑里从未想到过会有这种事情。她现在只有一个念头，就是下车离开他。要是能让这飞驰的火车停下来就好了，这样就可以挽回这场可怕的骗局。 她站起身来，想用力走到过道上--什么地方都行。她知道她得采取行动，赫斯渥伸出一只手，轻轻地按住了她。 “坐着别动，嘉莉，”他说，“坐着别动，现在站起来对你没有任何好处。听我说，我会告诉你我将怎么做。请等一会儿。”她在推着他的膝头，而他只是把她拉了回来。没有人注意到这场小小的争吵，困为车厢里人很少，而且都想打瞌睡了。 “我不愿意，”嘉莉说，可是她还是违心地坐了下来。“让我走，”她叫道。“你怎么敢这样？”她的眼睛里开始涌出大滴眼泪。 赫斯渥现在得全神贯注地对付眼前的麻烦，他不再去想自己的处境。他必须先把这姑娘安顿好，否则她会给他带来麻烦的。他使出浑身解数，试图说服她。 “现在你听着，嘉莉，”他说。“你没必要这样做。我并没想让你伤心。我不想做任何令你难过的事。”“唉，”嘉莉啜泣着。“唉，唉--呜--呜。”“好了，好了，”他说。“你不用哭了。听我说好吗？就听我说一分钟，我会告诉你我为什么要这样做。我没有其它的办法。我向你保证，我真是想不出别的办法。你听我说好吗？”他被她的啜泣弄得十分不安，以为他说的话她肯定一句也没听见。 “你听我说好吗？”他问。 “不，我不要听。”嘉莉说着，大怒起来。“我要你让我离开这里，否则我要喊列车员了。我不会跟你去的。真可耻。”恐惧的啜泣又一次打断了她想说的话。 赫斯渥有些吃惊地听着这些。他觉得她完全有理由这么伤心，但他还是希望能尽快摆平这事。马上列车员就要过来查票了。他不想声张，不想有什么麻烦。首先他必须让她安静下来。 “火车不停，你是下不了车的，”赫斯渥说，“要不了多久，我们就到下一站了。那时你想下车就下去好了。我不会阻拦你的。我只想你能听我说一下。让我告诉你，好吗？”嘉莉似乎并没在听。她只是把头转向车窗，窗外一片漆黑。火车正平稳地向前飞奔，越过田野，穿过树丛。当火车驶近荒凉的林地中的道口时，便传来长长的汽笛声，充满忧伤的、音乐般的韵味。 这时列车员走进车厢，检查了一两个在芝加哥上车的旅客的车票。他走近赫斯渥时，赫斯渥把两张票递了过去。嘉莉虽然作好了采取行动的准备，但是她没有动弹。她甚至都没回头看看。 列车员走后，赫斯渥松了一口气。 “你生我的气，是因为我骗了你，”他说，“我不是有意的，嘉莉。我的的确确不是有意的。我是不得已才这样做的。第一次看见你以后，我就离不开你了。\"他撇开不提最后的这次欺骗，似乎这事可以给忽略过去。他要使她相信，他太太已经不再是他们之间的障碍了。他偷的钱，他则试图忘个一干二净。 “不要对我说话，”嘉莉说。“我恨你。我要你给我走开。我一到下一站就下车。”当她说话时，由于激动和反抗，她浑身颤抖。 “好的，”他说，“可是你得先听我说完，好吗？毕竟你曾经说过爱我的话，你还是听我说吧。我不想做任何伤害你的事。 你走时，我会给你回去的路费。我只是想告诉你，嘉莉，不管你怎么想，你不能阻止我爱你。”他温柔地看着她，但是没有听到回答。 “你以为我卑鄙地欺骗了你，可是我并没有骗你。我不是有意这样做的。我和我的太太已经了断。她再也不能对我提出任何要求了。我再也不会去见他。这就是为什么今天晚上我会在这里。这就是为什么我会来带你走。”“你说查利受了伤，”嘉莉恶狠狠地说道。“你骗了我。你一直在欺骗我，现在你还要强迫我和你一起私奔。”她激动得站起身来，又要从他身边走过去。他让她过去了，她坐到另一个座位上。接着他也跟了过去。 “别离开我，嘉莉，”他温柔地说，“让我解释。只要你听我说完，就会明白我的立常我告诉你，我太太对我来说一文不值。很多年都是这样了，否则我也不会来找你。我要尽快离婚。 我再也不会去见她。我把这一切都结束了。你是我唯一想要的人。只要能得到你，我决不会再去想任何其他女人。\"嘉莉怒气冲冲地听了这番话。不管他做过些什么，这番话听起来倒还很诚恳。赫斯渥的声音和态度都透着一种紧张，不能不产生一定的效果。她不想和他有任何来往。他有太太，已经骗过她一次，现在又来骗她。她觉得他很可怕。然而，他这种大胆和魅力对一个女人还真有些诱惑力，若是能使她觉得这一切都是因爱她而骗的，那就特别能让她着迷。 火车的行进大大地有助于化解这场僵局。向前飞奔的车轮和向后消失的乡村把芝加哥甩得越来越远。嘉莉能感觉到她正被带往很远的一个地方--机车差不多是在直奔某个遥远的城市。她有时觉得像是要喊出声来，大吵一场，这样有人会来帮她；有时又觉得这样做似乎毫无用处--不管她做什么，都不会有人来帮她。赫斯渥则一直在煞费苦心地求情，想使她受到感动而同情他。 “我实在是不得已而为之呀。” 嘉莉不屑一听。 “当我明白除非我和你结婚，否则你不愿和我来往时，我就决定抛开一切，带你和我一起走。我现在要去另一个城市。 我想先去蒙特利尔住一阵子，然后你想去哪里就去哪里。只要你说去纽约，我们就去纽约祝”“我不想和你有任何关系，”嘉莉说，“我要下车。现在我们去哪里？”“去底特律，”赫斯渥说。 “啊！”嘉莉说，心里一阵剧痛。目的地这么遥远，这么明确，看来事情更难办了。 “你和我一起去好吗？”他说，似乎生怕她不愿意。“你什么都不用做，只管随我旅行。我绝对不会打扰你。你可以看看蒙特利尔和纽约，以后如果你不想留下来，你可以回去。这总比你今夜就回去要好。”嘉莉第一次听到一个还算合理的建议。这个建议似乎还可行，尽管她十分害怕如果她真要照这个建议去做，会遭到他的反对。蒙特利尔和纽约！而此刻她正在向这些伟大而陌生的地方飞奔，只要她愿意，她就能看见它们了。她这么想着，却不动声色。 这时，赫斯渥觉得自己看见了一线希望，她可能会同意这个建议，便加倍地表现他的热忱。 “想想看，”他说，“我所放弃的一切。芝加哥我是再也回不去了。倘若你不和我一起去，我现在只得一个人流落他乡了。 你不会抛弃我的，是吧，嘉莉？” “我不要听你说话，”她坚决地回答。 赫斯渥沉默了一会儿。 嘉莉觉得火车在减速。如果她真的要采取行动，现在是行动的时候了。她心神不安地动了起来。 “别想着走，嘉莉，”他说。“倘若你曾经喜欢过我，就和我一起去，让我们从现在开始吧。你怎么说，我就怎么做。我可以娶你，也可以让你回去。给你自己一点时间想一想。倘若我不爱你，我就不会叫你来。我告诉你，嘉莉，苍天作证，没有你我就活不下去。没有你我就不想活了。”这人的请求如此强烈，深深激起了嘉莉的同情。此刻驱使他的是吞噬一切的烈火。他爱她爱得太深，不能想象在这个时候，在他痛苦的时候放弃她。他紧张地抓住她的手，带着恳切的哀求，紧紧地握着。 这时火车差不多要停下来了。它正驶过旁边轨道上的几节车厢。车外一片黑暗和凄凉。车窗上开始有几滴水珠，表明下雨了。嘉莉正左右为难。想下决心，又觉得无助。火车已经停了下来，而她却还在听他哀求。机车向后倒了几英尺，随后一切都静止了。 她仍旧动摇不定，根本无法采取行动。时间在一分一分地过去，她还是犹豫不决，他则还在哀求着。 “倘若我想回去，你会让我回去吗？”她问，似乎现在是她占了上风，彻底征服了她的同伴。 “当然罗，”他答道，“你知道我会的。” 嘉莉只是听着，就像一个暂时宣布了大赦的人一样。她开始觉得仿佛这件事情完全在她的掌握之中。 火车又飞奔起来。赫斯渥换了一个话题。 “你很累了吧？”他说。 “不，”她答道。 “我给你在卧铺车厢要个铺位好吗？” 她摇了摇头，尽管她满脑子烦恼，他一肚子诡计，但她却开始注意到她过去一直感觉到的一点--他很会体贴人。 “还是要一个吧，”他说。“你会感觉舒服多了。”她摇了摇头。 “那就让我给你垫上我的大衣，”他站起身来，把他的轻便大衣舒服地垫在她的脑后。 “行了，”他温柔地说，“现在你试试能否休息一下。”见她顺从了，他很想吻她一下。他坐在她身边的座位上，沉思了一会儿。 “我看会有一场大雨，”他说。 “看来是这样，”嘉莉说。听着一阵阵风送来的雨点声，她的神经渐渐地安静了下来。火车正穿过黑暗，朝着一个更新的世界疾驶而去。 赫斯渥对自己能使嘉莉多少平静了一些感到满意，但这只是个很短暂的安慰。现在既然她不反对了，他就能用所有的时间来考虑他所犯的错误。 他的处境十分痛苦，因为他并不想要他偷来的那笔可耻的钱，他不想像个贼。那笔钱或其它任何东西，都永远无法补偿他如此愚蠢地抛下的过去的境况。它无法还给他的那些成群的朋友，他的名声，他的房子以及家庭，也无法还给他一个他臆想中要得到的嘉莉。他被驱逐出了芝加哥--驱逐出了他那轻松、安逸的环境。他亲手剥夺了自己的尊严、欢乐的聚会和怡人的夜晚。而这为了什么？他越想越觉得无法忍受。他开始考虑，他要努力恢复他原有的境况。他要把那笔昨夜偷来的可耻的钱还回去，解释清楚。也许莫埃会理解。也许他们会原谅他，让他回去。 中午时分，火车隆隆地开进底特律，他开始感到异常的紧张。现在警察一定在追捕他了。他们可能已经通知了各大城市的警察，会有侦探在监视他。他想起一些盗用公款的罪犯被捉拿归案的例子。因此，他呼吸沉重，脸色有点发白。两只手也不知所措，像是想干点什么事。他假装对车外的几处风景感兴趣，实际上他一点兴趣也没有。他反复用脚敲着地板。 嘉莉看出了他的焦虑不安，但没有说话。她完全不知道这意味着什么或者有什么重要性。 此时，他不明白自己为什么没有问一下这班车是否直达蒙特利尔或加拿大某地。也许他可以省点时间。他跳起来，去找列车员。 “这班车有开往蒙特利尔的车厢吗？”他问。 “有，后面一节卧汽车厢就是。” 他原想多问几句，但又觉得不大明智，便决定到车站上去问。 火车喷着气，隆隆地开进车常 “我想我们最好直接去蒙特利尔，”他对嘉莉说，“我去看看我们下车后该怎么转车。”他非常紧张，但他极力装出镇静的样子。嘉莉只是不安地张大眼睛看着他。她心里很乱，不知如何是好。 火车停了，赫斯渥领着她出来。他小心地看了一下四周，假装是在照顾嘉莉。确定没人在监视他，他便向票房走去。 “下一班去蒙特利尔的火车什么时候开？”他问。 “２０分钟以后，”售票员说。 他买了两张车票加头等卧铺票。然后，他匆忙回到嘉莉身边。 “我们马上又上车，”他说，几乎没注意到嘉莉看上去又累又乏。 “但愿我没卷进来，”她抱怨地叫道。 “到了蒙特利尔你就会感觉好些的，”他说。 “我什么东西都没带，”嘉莉说，“连一块手帕都没有。”“一到那里，你就可以去买你所需要的一切，最亲爱的，”他解释道。“你可以请个裁缝来。”这时，站台上的人高声喊着火车要开了，于是他们上了车。火车开动了，赫斯渥松了一口气，不久火车就开到了河边，他们在那里渡过了河。火车刚开下渡轮，他就放心地吸了口气，安坐下来。 “再过不久就要到了，”他说道。放下心来，他又想起了嘉莉。“我们明天一大早就到了。”嘉莉不屑回答。 “我去看看有没有餐车，”他又说，“我饿了。”","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/70/3861.html","bookId":547,"book":{"id":547,"title":"Sister
