{"id":25937,"no":12,"title":"CHAPTER XII A Misunderstanding Cleared Up","content":"Instinctively the eyes of nearly all on board the Olivette turned towards the object of the policemen\u0027s presence. Gregory had spotted the representatives of the Law too. Mr. Graham, regarding him from a distance of about twenty feet, fancied that his jaw dropped slightly and that his face became a darker tint. Beyond that Gregory gave no indication of either fear or defiance. \\n\\n \\n\\n Presently the crowd parted as the stalwart men in blue advanced towards the quay-side with the obvious intention of crossing the deck of the Unity and boarding the Olivette. \\n\\n \\n\\n Even then Gregory did not shift his position. Desmond, watching him out of the corner of his eye, wondered what the wanted youth was going to do. It seemed improbable that a hardened young criminal would give in tamely while a chance remained to attempt to escape. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think that if I were in his place,\" soliloquized Desmond, \"I\u0027d jump into the dinghy and scull for the other side of the harbour like blue blazes. Perhaps he\u0027ll dish the bobbies yet.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Armitage advanced to the rail to receive the two policemen. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You know what we\u0027re here for, sir?\" remarked one of the men. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Scoutmaster nodded. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What\u0027s the lad done?\" he asked in a low tone. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Broke into an old woman\u0027s shop, rifled the till, and well-nigh did for her, sir,\" was the reply. \"He\u0027s a dangerous chap, seeing he\u0027s not turned seventeen. Did he give you any trouble, sir?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"None whatever, Constable.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s strange, sir.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"When a fellow\u0027s sea-sick there\u0027s the bottom knocked out of the universe as far as he\u0027s concerned,\" remarked the Scoutmaster drily. \\n\\n \\n\\n The second constable had meanwhile sauntered for\u0027ard, keeping the still unresisting but now restless Gregory between him and the bows of the Olivette. At a sign from his companion the policeman laid his hand on the wanted lad\u0027s shoulder. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Come on, Greening,\" he exclaimed. \"This is the end of your little stunt. Come quietly now, or there\u0027ll be more trouble.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What for?\" demanded the youth with sudden energy. \"My name\u0027s not Greening—it\u0027s Gregory, and I ain\u0027t done nothin\u0027!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And half a dozen other aliases, I suppose?\" rejoined his captor caustically. \"It won\u0027t wash, Greening, so chuck it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The boy appealed wildly to Mr. Armitage. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve done nothin\u0027 wrong, have I, sir?\" he exclaimed. \"It ain\u0027t you who\u0027s given me in charge, is it, sir?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The Scoutmaster did not know what to reply. It seemed a despicable act on his part to have kept the boy \"in the dark\" until his captors were upon him. He could only shake his head in a deprecatory way. \\n\\n \\n\\n Gregory went quietly. With quite unnecessary vehemence the two policemen bundled him off the Olivette and across the deck of the smack. Murmurs of pity rose from the throng of interested spectators, while execrations of no mild form were hurled at the crew of the Olivette and the two Scoutmasters in particular, for their part in surrendering their charge. Clearly the sympathies of the Sutton Pool habitués were strongly in favour of the prisoner. \\n\\n \\n\\n Suddenly the lad stopped and raised his head. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Uncle! Uncle Garge!\" he shouted. \\n\\n \\n\\n A short, burly man on the fringe of the crowd, on hearing himself addressed, elbowed his way through the press and planted himself rigidly in front of the leading policeman. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What you\u0027m doin\u0027 wi\u0027 my nephew?\" he demanded. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Tell them my name\u0027s Gregory, Uncle,\" exclaimed the youth, before the policemen could say a word. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Corse it tes,\" rejoined the fisherman. \"Same as mine, an\u0027 nothin\u0027 for to be ashamed on. What are ye got \u0027im for, perliceman?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Broke out of the Borstal Institution at Portland, day before yesterday,\" replied the constable laconically. \\n\\n \\n\\n The little man held his sides, threw back his head, and laughed uproariously. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Lead on, Joe!\" exclaimed one of the policemen to his comrade. \"We can\u0027t stop here arguing the point.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Get back, man!\" said the other constable, addressing the highly amused fisherman. \"Get back, or I\u0027ll run you in for obstruction.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Just then the two Scoutmasters came up. The assertion of Gregory\u0027s uncle and the policemen\u0027s replies had been distinctly audible on board the Olivette. Realizing that there was certainly a mistake somewhere, Mr. Armitage jumped ashore to see the matter through, and Mr. Graham followed to back him up. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think there\u0027s some misunderstanding, Constable,\" observed Mr. Armitage. \"We\u0027ll go with you to the station. This man\u0027s assertion quite conforms to—er—Gregory\u0027s statement when we picked him up in West Bay.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But didn\u0027t you report the matter to Prawle Point, sir?\" asked the policeman. \"They telephoned the information on to us and we acted upon it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A howl of execration burst from the lips of the onlookers. Clearly they regarded the Scoutmaster as the cause of the trouble. \\n\\n \\n\\n Realizing that there was not much to be gained by arguing with a couple of policemen on Sutton Pool quay in the face of hostilely inclined onlookers, Mr. Armitage did not reply to the question. \\n\\n \\n\\n A few minutes later the double doors of the police-station closed in the faces of a curious and demonstrative crowd, while the two Scoutmasters, Gregory, uncle and nephew, and the two policemen entered the charge-room, where they were greeted by a stern-faced inspector. \\n\\n \\n\\n On the one hand the police had acted upon instructions. The description of the missing Borstal lad corresponded very closely with that of the youth removed from the Olivette. The time, place, and proximity to Portland, as far as the rescue in West Bay was concerned, tended to bear out the official view of the case. \\n\\n \\n\\n On the other hand Uncle Garge Gregory, a well-known local smack-owner, was emphatic that the lad was his nephew and that he certainly was not at Portland a week ago, because his sister had mentioned his nephew in a letter. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All you\u0027ve got ter du, Inspector,\" he added, \"is tu telegraph tu the police at Abbotsbury an\u0027 get them to see my brother Tom—young Tom here\u0027s father.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The inspector turned to Mr. Armitage. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You reported the matter, I understand?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We merely reported that we had picked up a boat with a boy in it somewhere in West Bay,\" replied the Scoutmaster. \"The reply to our signal was to the effect that the boy was the one who had broken out of Portland. We had no reason to doubt the statement. Now we know that it is wrong, but you must admit that the assertion did not come from us. I might also point out that the dinghy bears the words: \u0027Gregory—Abbotsbury\u0027.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All right, Gregory,\" said the inspector, addressing \"Uncle Garge\". \"You can take your nephew away and be responsible for him. Bring him here to-morrow at ten o\u0027clock—merely as a matter of form.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The crowd without raised a cheer when the two Gregorys appeared. Mr. Armitage and Mr. Graham were greeted with a storm of hisses and cat-calls. \\n\\n \\n\\n Holding his nephew\u0027s arm, Garge Gregory mounted a doorstep and held up his hand. Such was the popularity of the little man that almost instantly the noisy throng relapsed into silence. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Friends!\" exclaimed Mr. Gregory in stentorian tones, \"\u0027tes all a mistake. You\u0027m no call tu rant at these gen\u0027l\u0027men here. They be rare gude uns, seein\u0027 as \u0027ow they saved my nephew\u0027s life, so tu say. Look see: they bain\u0027t a-had nothin\u0027 tu du wi\u0027 this little misunderstandin\u0027. T\u0027was all the fault of the perlice; so don\u0027t \u0027ee shout agin\u0027 these gen\u0027l\u0027men no more.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We\u0027m mighty sorry to be sure, sir,\" said one of the men, who had been conspicuous in the hostile demonstration. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Quite all right,\" replied Mr. Armitage hurriedly. \"We all make mistakes sometimes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n It was nearly eight o\u0027clock when the two Scoutmasters regained the Olivette. Although the rain had ceased it was now quite out of the question to think of the Southend Sea Scouts setting out on their long trek. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We are sleeping on board to-night,\" announced Mr. Graham, after Mr. Armitage had briefly related what had occurred at the police-station. \"If any of you fellows want to stretch your legs, let me recommend a stroll round the Hoe before it gets dark.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A little later a fisherman crossed the deck of the Unity and dumped a pailful of fish into the Olivette\u0027s well. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Might come in handy like, mister,\" he said sheepishly. \"Us—me an\u0027 my mates—wish tu make amends, in a manner o\u0027 speakin\u0027, for kicking up a shine. Us hopes you\u0027ll let bygones be bygones, sir, an\u0027 if you\u0027m wantin\u0027 any assistance while you\u0027m stoppin\u0027 at Plymouth don\u0027t \u0027ee be afraid tu ax any o\u0027 we.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2714/74611.html","bookId":1437,"book":{"id":1437,"title":"Sea Scouts up-Channel","description":"简介： It\u0027s going to be a dirty night, remarked Mr. Graham, Scoutmaster of the 9th Southend-on-Sea Sea Scouts.
