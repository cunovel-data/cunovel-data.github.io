{"id":25938,"no":13,"title":"CHAPTER XIII The Trek","content":"At eight o\u0027clock on the following morning the Spindrift\u0027s navigation party \"fell in\" on the deck of the Olivette. Each member carried a couple of blankets rolled in a ground-sheet, haversack containing toilet requirements in the outer pocket, and rations in the inner one. In addition, Mr. Graham had a pair of binoculars slung across his shoulders, and carried a bundle of charts. Patrol Leader Desmond was responsible for the bulky volumes, The Channel Pilot, Lists of Lights, and the Admiralty Tide Tables. Findlay was additionally burdened with a camp kettle with a folding handle, while Hayes acted as \"emergency man\" to relieve the others of their additional gear in turn. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Good luck and bon voyage!\" exclaimed Mr. Armitage. \"We\u0027ll keep a look out for you when you approach the Wight. We\u0027re generally cruising about there when we haven\u0027t any particular object in view.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I suppose you\u0027ll make Falmouth to-day,\" remarked Mr. Graham. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Armitage glanced aloft, where the clouds were scudding fairly rapidly across the sky. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Glass is falling,\" he replied. \"I think we\u0027ll keep inside the breakwater to-day. Look here, Graham, suppose we run you up the Tamar. It will knock about twelve miles off your journey.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Thanks awfully,\" said Mr. Graham frankly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We don\u0027t know the Tamar,\" continued Mr. Armitage, \"but there\u0027s no reason why we shouldn\u0027t find our course up the river. It won\u0027t be the first time we\u0027ve had to navigate strange waters. It will be rather fun. Start her up, lads.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n In five minutes the crew of the Olivette had their able little craft ready to get under way. The warps holding her to the Unity were cast off, and the boat began to gather way. \\n\\n \\n\\n As usual, Mr. Armitage left the navigation to his Patrol Leader, merely standing by ready to correct any possible error that might result in a serious mishap. So Woodleigh, with a large-scale chart of \"The Approaches to Plymouth\", was in the wheelhouse, giving the course to Flemming at the wheel. \\n\\n \\n\\n Warkworth was in charge of the motor, and, as was the invariable custom in crowded waters, kept within arm\u0027s length of the clutch. The rest of the Sea Scouts were on deck taking in the ever-changing view with the deepest interest. \\n\\n \\n\\n Drake\u0027s Island glided past on the port beam. The intricate narrows between Devil\u0027s Point and Cremyll were safely negotiated, and the expansive Hamoaze, a sheltered sheet of water large and deep enough to accommodate the navies of the world, came into view. \\n\\n \\n\\n Assisted by the strong flood-tide, the Olivette made rapid progress past the Royal Dockyard and Keyham Yard to starboard, and with warships of all sizes and descriptions lying at moorings on their port hand. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There\u0027s a bridge right ahead of us, sir,\" reported Rayburn. \"Shall we have to lower our mast to go under it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How high is our mast?\" asked the Scoutmaster gravely. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Twenty-five feet, sir,\" replied Rayburn promptly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We may just do it, then,\" rejoined Mr. Armitage. \"You needn\u0027t bother about unshackling the forestay just yet. Wait and see what the clearance of the bridge looks like when we get a bit nearer.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A couple of minutes later Rayburn came aft again. \"I think we\u0027ll just manage it, sir,\" he reported. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Very well; carry on,\" was the response. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was not long before the two miles of river below the bridge were covered, and when the Olivette glided serenely under one of the wide and massive spans Rayburn positively blushed. What he had taken to be a low bridge was in reality the famous Saltash Bridge, with a clearance of a hundred feet. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s one up against you, Rayburn!\" exclaimed Hepburn, and in the general laugh the embarrassed Sea Scout went below. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ease her down, Flemming,\" suggested Mr. Armitage. \"We\u0027re getting into an intricate waterway, and if we touch with a lot of way on we may do ourselves damage.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Above Saltash Bridge the Tamar contracts considerably. What it loses in breadth it gains in scenery, for on either side high ground crowned with trees made a picturesque setting to the tidal estuary. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We\u0027re in luck,\" said Woodleigh, pointing to a small paddle-steamer ahead. \"She\u0027ll be our pilot.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n In a few minutes the Olivette had overhauled the paddle-boat sufficiently to be right in her foamy wake. Speed was still further reduced until the distance between the two craft was evenly maintained. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Woodleigh will make one of the smartest coastal navigators going,\" observed Mr. Armitage to his brother Scoutmaster. \"He knows all the \u0027tricks of the trade\u0027 already. He\u0027d make a capital master of a tug or coasting vessel, but curiously enough he hasn\u0027t shone at deep-sea navigation. I tried to teach him to work out a position by sextant, but it was hopeless.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And yet, on the other hand,\" rejoined Mr. Graham, \"how many seamen one meets who are absolutely out of it when navigating in shallow waters. I\u0027ve seen Royal Navy men—jolly smart fellows at their work—\u0027tied up in knots\u0027 when compelled by circumstances to navigate shallow, intricate channels, through which yachtsmen and fishermen venture with impunity.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Calstock, a small village boasting a magnificent stone railway bridge across the river, came into sight. This was the Olivette\u0027s limit as far as the Tamar was concerned. Berthing alongside the quay and astern of the steamer that had perforce acted as a pilot, the crew once more bade their guests and fellow Sea Scouts good luck. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Graham, armed with an Ordnance map, \"set the course \", aiming as far as possible to keep off the highroad. This meant loss of speed; but on the other hand it was preferable to tramping stolidly along a hard-surfaced highway. \\n\\n \\n\\n The lads were thoroughly enjoying themselves. Tramping after a sea voyage came as a complete change. What was more, there was a goal for which they were making—something to speed them to renewed energies. By five o\u0027clock in the afternoon they arrived at the old-fashioned Cornish town of Launceston, where, guided by a local Scoutmaster, they found a splendid camping-ground a little to the north of the town. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was a Spartan-like camp, but fortunately the weather was decidedly on the mend. The drizzle they had experienced at Plymouth had been left behind, and on the lofty Cornish hinterland the ground was quite dry and the air marvellously bracing. \\n\\n \\n\\n Very soon a fire was burning brightly. Over it, suspended by a stout sapling held up by a couple of crossed poles, the kettle boiled very quickly. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was a gorgeous, Scout-like meal. Tea slightly flavoured with the reek of burnt wood, huge slabs of bread liberally plastered with fresh butter, kippers (purchased in Launceston) fried in the hot embers, and huge, floury potatoes baked in their skins, made a satisfying and appetizing repast. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How\u0027s that wound on your toe, Desmond?\" inquired Mr. Graham. He had asked the same question at least half a dozen times before, and the Patrol Leader had stoutly asserted that he hardly felt it, and that it was healing nicely. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s a bit painful, sir,\" admitted Desmond reluctantly. While he had been on the move he had practically forgotten all about it; but now, sprawling on the turf, he was aware of a persistent and increasing throb. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Take your shoe and stocking off and let me see the injury,\" said the Scoutmaster. \\n\\n \\n\\n Desmond did so. In spite of the fact that the ratbite had been carefully washed with disinfectant the flesh was badly inflamed. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Graham dressed the wound and insisted on the Patrol Leader keeping still for the rest of the evening. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We\u0027ll see how it looks in the morning,\" he added. \"If it\u0027s not considerably better you\u0027ll have to finish the trek by train.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n It was jolly plucky on Desmond\u0027s part to have started with a toe in that condition; but he failed to grasp the other side of the case. By \"carrying on\" he had made the wound worse, with the result that he might be laid up for several days, and thus throw a heavy strain upon the rest of the crew of the Spindrift. If, however, he had admitted that his foot was painful, Mr. Graham would have sent him to Bude by train from Plymouth, and in all probability, by the time the others arrived to take over the yacht, Desmond would have been able to carry out his duties without physical discomfort. \\n\\n \\n\\n The fire was kept up and given a plentiful supply of fuel when darkness set in. The four trekkers had already prepared their beds on a sloping expanse of turf under the lee of a rough stone wall. Making the beds was a simple matter, and consisted of scooping out a small hole to take the pressure of each sleeper\u0027s hip. Then the ground-sheets were spread proofed-side downwards, and the blankets arranged to fold over so that there were two thicknesses above and below the sleeper. Haversacks laid over a heap of moss provided a pillow, while the fold of the ground-sheet over everything made an effectual protection from the night dews. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Comfortable, Desmond?\" inquired the Scoutmaster. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, sir,\" came the muffled reply. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Good night, everyone!\" exclaimed Mr. Graham. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Good night, sir,\" was the rejoinder from three very sleepy lads, and five minutes later silence reigned in the camp. \\n\\n \\n\\n Almost before the sun had risen Hayes awoke, stretched himself, and got up. His companions were still sleeping soundly. Resisting the temptation to place a wet sponge on Jock Findlay\u0027s face, the Sea Scout went to a near-by brook and washed. Then, stirring the still-glowing embers of last night\u0027s fire and applying fresh fuel, he coaxed the dried wood into a healthy blaze. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Isn\u0027t it fine!\" he exclaimed to himself, as he stood erect, breathing in the pure moorland air and surveying the expanse of undulating ground terminated by the rugged heights of Brown Willy. \"I never thought there was such a view. There ought to be some scheme for sending East Coast Scouts to camp in Cornwall, and give Cornish Scouts a chance to see the Essex mudflats. Now then, you sleepy bounders! Out you turn.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n By the time the others had performed their ablutions, Hayes had the porridge under way. It hardly mattered that one kettle had to answer for all culinary purposes; that the porridge had a slight flavour of tea and that there were a few tea-leaves in it. Toned down with thick Cornish cream and a lavish quantity of golden syrup the porridge disappeared, and was pronounced excellent. Slices of streaky bacon grilled over the fire were devoured with gusto, notwithstanding particles of wood ash which adhered to the fat. \\n\\n \\n\\n Breakfast over, the Sea Scouts struck camp. They did so methodically. The blankets, after being aired, were folded; the scanty gear cleaned and packed away. Then the cinders of the fire and all loose paper and refuse were buried, so that the owner of the land would have no cause for complaint. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now let me see your toe again, Desmond,\" said Mr. Graham. \\n\\n \\n\\n Desmond felt none too happy as far as his injury was concerned. He sat down and removed the dressings. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"H\u0027m,\" remarked the Scoutmaster. \"A little better, but there\u0027s still a fair amount of inflammation. It\u0027s the puff-puff for you, my lad. It\u0027s as much as you can do to walk to the railway station.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Protesting ineffectually, the Patrol Leader was escorted into the town. At the station it was found that there was a train in an hour and a half\u0027s time. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027ll be there before us, old man,\" said Jock consolingly. \"Since you\u0027ve got to keep your foot up you might try lying on one of the bunks of the Spindrift in case there are any rats on board. They seem very partial to you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s a fact,\" rejoined the victim bitterly. \"I guess that rat knew I have a Naturalist\u0027s Badge.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2714/74612.html","bookId":1437,"book":{"id":1437,"title":"Sea Scouts up-Channel","description":"简介： It\u0027s going to be a dirty night, remarked Mr. Graham, Scoutmaster of the 9th Southend-on-Sea Sea Scouts.
