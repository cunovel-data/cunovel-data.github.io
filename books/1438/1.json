{"id":15560,"no":1,"title":"PREFACE.","content":"The first chapter of these Volumes discloses the reasons which induced me to undertake the present Biography—a task amounting to a labour of love, owing to the personal interest I have felt in it from beginning to end. How far, however, I may succeed in satisfying my Readers—fully conscious as I am of my own demerits and the many defects to be met with—I leave them to decide, trusting to their kind indulgence not to be hypercritical in their verdict on my faithful endeavour to perform my duty both to them and to the subject of these memoirs. \\n\\n \\n\\n Some delay has arisen in the completion of the work, to be attributed to three causes: the interruption occasioned by my official duties, the variety and complicated nature of the subject, and the numerous translations required for the full development of the life I desired to treat with justice in every respect. \\n\\n \\n\\n Grateful acknowledgments are due for the valuable assistance received from Mr. Charles Cannon of the Foreign Office, Mr. Richard Garnett of the IVBritish Museum, Mr. C. E. Fagan and from Mr. C. M. Tyndall, to whom I am deeply indebted. Certainly in no less degree must I record, with sincere thanks, the cheerful and graceful aid rendered me by Madame Arditi, who has, throughout my labours, proved a most encouraging and able coadjutrix. \\n\\n \\n\\n The respectful expression of my gratitude to the Duke D’Aumale and to the Right Honourable W. E. Gladstone is an honourable duty, since to them as well as to Mrs. Franklin, Sir Gilbert Lewis, Sir James Lacaita, Mr. C. T. Newton, Mr. Andrew Rutherfurd and the late Mr. Edward Ellice I am indebted for the loan of letters, etc., without which my work could never have attained the degree of completeness of which it may fairly boast. Finally, in the list should also be named those who have helped me to present these volumes in their finished state—MM. Durand, Pilotell, Sem and F. Gusman, to whose courtesy I owe six of the portraits interspersed within these pages. \\n\\n \\n\\n To men of letters throughout the civilized world I can scarcely doubt that a biography of one so well-known in his particular and important sphere as was the earnest worker of whom I have written should be otherwise than acceptable. Nevertheless, it is with some anxiety that I lay my venture before the public, Vthough trusting at the same time that no serious drawback in the accomplishment of my labours may prevent a just appreciation of them by all considerate readers. \\n\\n Louis Fagan. \\n\\n 2a, Granville Place, \\n\\n Portman Square, W. \\n\\n September, 1880. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2713/74587.html","bookId":1438,"book":{"id":1438,"title":"The life and correspondence of Sir Anthony Panizzi","description":"简介： The first chapter of these Volumes discloses the reasons which induced me to undertake the present Biographya task amounting to a labour of love, owing to the personal interest I have felt in it from beginning to end.
