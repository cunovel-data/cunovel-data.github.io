I\u0027m hoping to leave, but he\u0027s planted himself fi rmly in front of me without the slightest inclination of letting me go. Once he gets going, Gaunt Man can go on for a while. From across the hal , Ashley June shoots me a knowing look. She leans back against the wal , settling in.\\n\\n “Need any more proof?” Gaunt Man says. “They\u0027re admitting this is all a sham by how easily they cancel the lectures. Without even batting an eyelash. It\u0027s all just a joke.”\\n\\n His tongue slips out, wet and oily, lubricating his lips.\\n\\n “Release the hepers already. Just let us have at them.”\\n\\n “What do you think happened to him?” I ask, trying to change the topic.\\n\\n “The big guy? He\u0027s a fool. He was trying to imitate me.\\n\\n Went out there trying to show ingenuity and moxie the way I did.\\n\\n But what an idiot. Probably went out there with his SunBlock Lotion foolishly thinking it\u0027d help. For my money, the search teams should start looking for him outside— what remains of him, anyway— somewhere between here and the Dome.”\\n\\n “Maybe,” I say noncommittal y. I pause, waiting for him to go away. But he doesn\u0027t. “What do they have you wearing?” I ask. Gaunt Man has shown such a disdain for the event, perhaps any topic related to it will cause him to pick up and leave.\\n\\n “For the Gala?” He humphs. “A traditional, boring tuxedo that has ‘Irrelevant Old Guy\u0027 written all over it. What about you? Something high- end and splashy, I\u0027d expect.”\\n\\n “Why do you say that?”\\n\\n “Media\u0027s been arriving in droves since yesternight.\\n\\n Reporters, photographers, journalists.\\n\\n This Hunt\u0027s becoming more and more a media event by the hour.\\n\\n Heard they\u0027re jockeying for post- Hunt interviews,” he says irritably. “And for the Gala, they\u0027re gonna want to front the good- looking hunters. Including you, pretty boy; they probably have you in one of those dapper suits.”\\n\\n “Hardly,” I say. But he\u0027s right. My suit, Super 220 with worsted cloth and ful silk linings with my name sewn into the inseam, felt like a regal carpet when it was fi tted on me yesternight.\\n\\n “So I\u0027ve been hearing something about you.”\\n\\n “What\u0027s that?”\\n\\n “You have a partner in crime. That the two of you\u0027l be going out in force during the Hunt. The dynamic duo, you and the pretty one.”\\n\\n “The pretty one?”\\n\\n “Right there,” he says, pointing at Ashley June, still waiting for me across the hal . “That\u0027s the word on the street, anyway.”\\n\\n “Where are you hearing all of this?”\\n\\n “I have my sources,” he says. “So what\u0027s your strategy?” His voice takes on an edgier tone. Now I know why he\u0027s approached me: to talk about this. “Cut out fast, make us chase you both? Or start with the pack, beat us out with a gradual but methodical increase in pace?”\\n\\n “Wel , you know we—”\\n\\n “Separate the heper pack into two groups, then divide and con-quer? Or keep them together, play to their group hysteria?”\\n\\n “It\u0027s really something I can\u0027t get into right now.”\\n\\n He\u0027s quiet, as if mul ing this over. “Say,” he whispers, “got any room for an old geezer like me? In your all iance, I mean. I may not have the brawn, but I\u0027ve got the brains. Not saying you and her ain\u0027t brainy, but I\u0027ve got street smarts only experience gives. Maybe I can help.”\\n\\n “You know, we prefer to work in just a smal group. Just the two of us, actual y.”\\n\\n “What is it they say? ‘Though one may be overpowered, and two can defend themselves, a cord of three is not quickly broken.\u0027 ”\\n\\n “Look, I don\u0027t know.”\\n\\n He stares at me, his gaze turning cold. “I see.” He begins to walk away, stops, half turns toward me.\\n\\n “Things I know about you,” he says. “Don\u0027t think I didn\u0027t notice heper smel s coming off of you the other day. Don\u0027t think I\u0027m unaware that you\u0027ve somehow gotten access to heper fl esh. Real y, just what is going on in that library during the day when you\u0027re all alone? What kind of access to heper meat do you have in there? Is there a secret bootleg stash you\u0027ve discovered? Information like this could come out to harm you.” He sniffs viciously, his nostrils shrink-ing inward. “I still smel it.”\\n\\n A staffer approaches; Gaunt Man shoots him a look, then walks away.\\n\\n “Yes?” I say to the staffer.\\n\\n “Pardon me. I wanted to let you know that your tuxedo is ready and has been delivered to your lodging. Also, the eve ning gown for your date tonight”— the staffer looks quickly at Ashley June—“has been delivered to your lodging. The Director approved her request to get dressed there.”\\n\\n “Okay.”\\n\\n “Something else. When you walk to the Gala from the library, the media will be lined up along the brick walk, waiting for you.”\\n\\n “Is that really necessary?”\\n\\n “The Director\u0027s orders. Once he realized the two of you were going as a couple, he decided you\u0027d make an entrance of the fi rst order.”\\n\\n “I see.”\\n\\n “One more thing.”\\n\\n “Yes?”\\n\\n “You and the girl are not to spend the day in each other\u0027s rooms again.”\\n\\n “How do you—”\\n\\n “How we know is irrelevant. But the Director is afraid of public perception. With the media here, he wants to avoid even a suggestion of impropriety among the hunters.”\\n\\n “You\u0027ve got to be—”\\n\\n “Make sure you wake up in your own rooms tomorrow.”\\n\\n “Listen, I—”\\n\\n “The Director\u0027s orders,” he says, and leaves. I watch him walk over to Ashley June. A short, clipped conversation later, he\u0027s walking out. I head toward Ashley June.\\n\\n As I walk past Gaunt Man, now talking to Abs and Phys Ed, I hear him giving the same spiel about joining their all iance.\\n\\n He\u0027s desperate. Desperately hungry for heper fl esh, desperately in need of help. He doesn\u0027t stand a chance of getting either. That\u0027s someone to keep an eye on. There\u0027s no tel ing what a person can become capable of once desperation takes hold of him. Can\u0027t put anything past him.\\n\\n Back in the library, Ashley June and I get changed for the Gala, she in the periodical section, I by the front desk. My tuxedo, which I fi nd hanging off the reserve shelf in plastic wrap, fi ts me to a tee. It comes with bel s and whistles I could have done without: diamond-embedded cuff links, iron buttons embossed with the Ruler\u0027s face.\\n\\n Despite these, it\u0027s an impressive suit that compliments me well .\\n\\n Ashley June, her voice traveling down the length of the library, keeps warning me not to sneak a peek until she\u0027s ready. And she takes her time, much more than I think necessary to simply take off clothes and throw on a fi tted dress.\\n\\n Before she\u0027s done, there\u0027s a knock on the door. A retinue of staffers walks in. Each carries a smal case in tow.\\n\\n “Makeup,” they say curtly, and I point them to Ashley June.\\n\\n To my surprise, one of them stays behind. “I\u0027m going to do your face,” she says.\\n\\n “I don\u0027t think so,” I reply. There\u0027s too much risk that she\u0027l spot a stray hair fol icle on my body or face or get close enough to smel my body odor.\\n\\n “It\u0027s the Director\u0027s orders. Sit down now, lean your head back.”\\n\\n “No. It\u0027s not going to happen, trust me.”\\n\\n “It\u0027s just a touch- up job. It\u0027l be barely noticeable.”\\n\\n “So don\u0027t do it. How can I make myself clearer?”\\n\\n She glares at me. “You\u0027l answer to the Director.”\\n\\n “Fine. Send him down here.”\\n\\n Anger boils in the staffer\u0027s half- closed eyes. She slams the kit shut and joins the others in the periodical section.\\n\\n There\u0027s not a chance she\u0027l report this to the Director. She\u0027s all too aware of what happened to the escorts. Punishment will be meted out for indiscretions, but not to the hunters, who apparently have immunity.\\n\\n From the back of the library, I hear Ashley June objecting to the makeup. But with less success. They are having their way with her.\\n\\n I barge in, ready to parlay my hunter immunity card. They\u0027re grouped tightly around Ashley June, badgering her with their demands to sit back! pul your hair back! stop scrunching your face!\\n\\n all I can see of Ashley June are her knuckles, pressed white against the armrests of her leather chair.\\n\\n “Get out.” My voice is steady and quiet.\\n\\n They spin around, surprise and annoyance written on their faces.\\n\\n “This is not up to her. Or you.”\\n\\n “Get out.”\\n\\n “You\u0027l answer to—”\\n\\n “The Director? Sorry, but I\u0027ve already heard this speech.\\n\\n Now get out.” I see the smal est and youn gest of them, a girl no older than me, clutching her makeup bag. She\u0027s afraid, and for an instant I feel a stab of sorrow for her.\\n\\n “Look, don\u0027t worry. Leave a makeup kit and a mirror here; we can put it on ourselves. Now get out.”\\n\\n They offer little re sis tance after that.\\n\\n “That was close,” Ashley June says after the front doors close.\\n\\n A look of horror suddenly crosses her face. “Get out!”\\n\\n “What?”\\n\\n “Get out!”\\n\\n I spin around, expecting to see one of the staffers stil lurking.\\n\\n “No, you! Close your eyes. Close them, I said! Now get out!”\\n\\n “What\u0027s going on?”\\n\\n “You\u0027re not supposed to see me yet. Not until I\u0027m completely ready. Go, already!”\\n\\n How does the saying go? Girls will be girls? True, even in the moments after imminent death, apparently.\\n\\n One hour later, she\u0027s ready. I busy myself during that time taking out the FLUNs and familiarizing myself with them.\\n\\n They\u0027re simple to operate: a safety on the underside that\u0027s easy to disengage and a large trigger button on top. I don\u0027t fi re off any practice shots.\\n\\n With only three rounds in each gun, I don\u0027t want to waste even a single one. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hunt-the-hunt-1/page-33.html","bookId":1579,"book":{"id":1579,"title":"The Hunt (The Hunt #1)","description":"Storyline: The Hunt (The Hunt #1) \\n Don\u0027t Sweat.
