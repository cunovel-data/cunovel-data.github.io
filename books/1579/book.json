And most of all, whatever you do, do not fall in love with one of them. \\n Gene is different from everyone else around him. He can\u0027t run with lightning speed, sunlight doesn\u0027t hurt him and he doesn\u0027t have an unquenchable lust for blood. Gene is a human, and he knows the rules. Keep the truth a secret. It\u0027s the only way to stay alive in a world of night--a world where humans are considered a delicacy and hunted for their blood. \\n When he\u0027s chosen for a once in a lifetime opportunity to hunt the last remaining humans, Gene\u0027s carefully constructed life begins to crumble around him. He\u0027s thrust into the path of a girl who makes him feel things he never thought possible--and into a ruthless pack of hunters whose suspicions about his true nature are growing. Now that Gene has finally found something worth fighting for, his need to survive is stronger than ever--but is it worth the cost of his humanity?\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-hunt-the-hunt-1.jpg","author":"Andrew Fukuda","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","category":{"id":7,"name":"Science Fiction","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
