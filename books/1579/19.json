Why had he gone to such lengths to create that beam— and the two others— to point to the journal? The journal was meant to be found, that\u0027s obvious, but by whom and why are not so obvious. I\u0027m shutting the journal closed when I notice a blank white page smack bang in the middle of the journal. What an odd omission. The hundreds of pages before and after this page are fi l ed from top to bottom; yet this page, back and front, has been left blank. Not a dot of ink. Its whiteness is almost a shout. The last sentence on the preceding page isn\u0027t even complete— it\u0027s cut off midway and then continues on the page after this blank sheet, picking up exactly where it left off. I tap the spine of the book, pondering, confused. Like the refl ected beams of light that pointed me to this book, the very blankness of this page seems to be purposeful y directing my attention here. But as much as I examine it, I can\u0027t make heads or tails of it. I fl op down, tired. The room is suffocating; I grasp around my neck, feel the scrim of sweat and dirt under my jawline. I don\u0027t even need to lift my arm to smel the odor exuding off me like a dog in heat. It will be my escort who\u0027l make the discovery. When he comes to summon me after dusk, he\u0027l smel my odor fl owing out through the cracks along the door frame. He\u0027l sprint around, look inside through the windows, the shutters having already been retracted. He\u0027l see me still sitting in this chair, sul en and tired, my chest rising and fal ing, breathing hard, eyes wide because I will , though resigned, still be very afraid. He will see the emotion pouring off me in waves. And then he\u0027l understand. He will not cal for the others. He will want me for himself. He will leap through the glass windows— so frail in the face of his desire, like thin ice before a blowtorch— and even before the shattered shards have reached the ground, he wil be upon me. And then he will have me, devouring me with fangs and nails in just a few— And then, just like that, I realize something. The blinding whiteness of the outside feels like acid dropped on my eyebal s. I let the light leak in a little at a time, until I can see without blinking, then without squinting. It is hours before dusk, when the sun has just begun its descent. The sun isn\u0027t going quietly: bleeding red into the sky, it The sun isn\u0027t going quietly: bleeding red into the sky, it infuses the plains with an orange- and- purple hue. Without the Dome to cover the heper vil age, the mud huts look exposed and inconsequential in the plains, like rat droppings. Soon the light sensors will detect the arrival of night and the glass wal s will arc out of the ground, form a perfect dome, and protect the hepers from the world outside. I must hurry. There\u0027s a glimmer in front of the mud huts, like a hundred diamonds twinkling in the twilight. The pond. It\u0027s been staring me right in the face the whole time, while thirst ravaged and odor oozed off my body. How could I have been so blind? all the water I could possibly want, for drinking and washing, within easy access. The only danger would be the hepers, of course, who might not take kindly to my intrusion. They\u0027l be confused, of course, on the arrival of a stranger somehow able to withstand sun rays. But I know how to handle them. Bare my fangs, snap my neck side to side, click my bones; I\u0027m a master at impersonation. They\u0027l likely scatter to the four winds. Suddenly upbeat, I plow on toward the heper vil age. Gradual y, the mud huts begin to take shape, growing in size and detail. Then I see the hepers, a group of stick fi gures moving slowly around the pond, stopping, moving, stopping. The sight of them both excites and unnerves me. There are fi ve of them. They haven\u0027t noticed me yet, nor would they have: nobody has ever approached them during the day. When I am about a hundred yards away, they see me. One of them, crouching by the pond, shoots straight up, his arm jacking forward like a switchblade sprung out, pointing at me. The others turn quickly, heads pivoting toward me. Their reaction is instant: they turn and fl ee, bolting inside mud huts. I see windows shuttered closed, doors slammed shut. Within a few scant moments, they\u0027ve all vacated the pond, leaving upturned pots and pails around the pond in their wake. Just what I was hoping for. Nothing stirs. Not an opened shutter or a cracked door. I break into a trot, my dried- out bones dangling in my body, snapping with every jarring step. My gaze, fi xed on the pond, thirstily draws water out with the bucket of my eyes. I am getting closer, fifty yards out. A door to one of the mud huts opens. A female, that female heper, steps out. A look of rage on its face, but fear, too. It grips a spear in its right hand. Hanging off its hip is a simple fl at slab of dark hide leather, almost like a wide belt. A deadly row of daggers lies strapped in taut against the leather, their blades strangely curved at the hilt. I raise my hands with wide- open palms. I\u0027m not sure how much it comprehends, so I use simple words. “No hurt! No hurt!” I shout, but what ekes out instead are hoarse, indecipherable sounds. I try to push the words out again, but I can\u0027t gather enough saliva in my mouth to lubricate my throat. The setting sun, directly behind me, douses the heper vil age with color, like bright easel paint dripping onto drab leather shoes. My shadow extends long and preternatural y thin before me, a long, gnarled fi nger reaching out to that girl heper. I\u0027m nothing but a silhouette to it. No; I\u0027m more. I\u0027m the enemy, the predator, the hunter: that\u0027s why the other hepers fl ed. But I\u0027m also something else: a mystery. A confounding contradiction, because although I am in the sunlight, I am not disintegrating. And that is why the female heper has not fl ed but stands in front of me, puzzled, curious. But not for long. With a primal scream, it strides toward me, its body at a slant, one arm extended backward. It fl ings its arm forward in a violent blur. It takes a moment before I realize what\u0027s going on. And by then it\u0027s too late. I hear a whistling sound as the spear cuts through air, can even see the wooden length vibrating slightly from side to side as the spear slices toward me. Right at me. In the end, I\u0027m just lucky. I don\u0027t move to avoid the spear— there\u0027s no time— and it whizzes through the space between my head and left shoulder. I hear and feel the whoosh by my left ear. And then the heper is reaching down to its dagger strap; in less than a second, it\u0027s unstrapped a dagger and is instantaneously fl inging it with a rapid sidearm motion. The dagger shoots out of its hand, fl ashing in the sunlight. But way off. Way off. Like a mile off— the dagger sails harmlessly away. Figures, I think. These hepers are nothing more than— But then the gleaming dagger begins to curve back toward me, its trajectory that of a boomerang, blinking wickedly fast in the light. As if winking with mischief. And before I know it, it\u0027s coming right at me. I dive to my right, hit the ground. The dagger swoosh es past my head, giving off the harmonic overtone of a singing bowl. I land ungraceful y, get the air knocked out of me. The ground is hard, despite the layer of sand and grit. This heper girl— it knows what it\u0027s doing. This is not just for show. It really means to maim me, if not kil me. I leap up, hands raised high, palms opened emphatical y. It is already reaching down toward the strap, where three more daggers lie taut against the leather. Like hunting hounds pul ing restlessly on a leash. In the blink of an eye, the heper has unstrapped a dagger and is already drawing back its arm. To unleash the next throw. It will not miss this time. “Stop! Please!” I yel , and for the fi rst time, the words come out clearly. It pauses midthrow. I waste little time. I start walking toward the heper again, pulling off my shirt as I do. It needs to see my skin, the sun on the skin, see that I present no danger. I toss the shirt to the side. I\u0027m close enough to see its eyes fol ow the shirt, then shoot back at me. It is squinting; I stop in my tracks. I\u0027ve never seen anyone squint. It is so . . . expressive. The eclipsed half closing of the eyelids, the wrinkles coming off the corners of the eyes like a delta, the brows contracted together, even the mouth frozen in a snarl of confusion. It is a strange expression, it is a lovely expression. It pul s its arm back again, the dagger glinting in the sun. “Wait!” I shout with a craggy croak. It halts, its fi ngers whiten-ing as they grip the blade tighter. I undo the buttons of my pants, take them off. My socks, my shoes, everything off. Just my briefs left on. I stand like that before it, then slowly move forward. “Water,” I say, gesturing at the pond. “Water.” I make a cup motion with my hand. It moves its eyes up and down my body, unsure and suspicious, emotions sweeping off its face, naked and primal. Eyes fi xed on each other, I walk past, giving it a wide arc, and head to the pond. It\u0027s more like a swimming pool, the way it is rimmed with a metal ic border, perfectly circular. Before I know it, I\u0027m on my knees, my cupped hands pushing through the plane of water. The water, when it fl ows down my throat, is heaven\u0027s wet cool on hell \u0027s coaled fi re. My hands spring back into the water, ready to cup more into my mouth; and then I\u0027m done with formalities. I plunge my head into the water, gulping down the blissful sweet cool wetness, the water reaching up to my ears. I come up for air. The heper hasn\u0027t moved, but its confusion is carved even deeper into its face. But it\u0027s no longer dangerous. Not right now. I throw my whole head back into the pond, my dry, coarse hair gulping up water like straws. The pores on the back of my neck fl inch at fi rst contact, then they open up, delighting in the cool aquatic contact. When I come up for air the second time, the heper has made its way down to the pond. It sits in a crouched position, its arms placed fl at atop its kneecaps, the way monkeys do. Figures. It is still half gripping a dagger strapped to its hip, but with less urgency now. The water\u0027s effect on me is almost instant. Synapses in my brain start refi ring; my head feels freed of cotton wool, more like a wel -oiled machine. Things begin to dawn on me quickly. The dusk, for one, how it is so quickly ceding to the night. Very soon— within moments— the Dome is going to emerge from the ground.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hunt-the-hunt-1/page-19.html","bookId":1579,"book":{"id":1579,"title":"The Hunt (The Hunt #1)","description":"Storyline: The Hunt (The Hunt #1) Don\u0027t Sweat.
