A royal blue runner ran down the aisle and out through the church doors.\n There were old friends in attendance.\n And new ones.\n The groom was handsome, tall and dark.\n The bride was far more than beautiful. Her happiness literally glowed.\n She entered to the strains of a beautiful love ballad.\n \"That\u0027s gorgeous,\" Deanna whispered to Heidi where they stood waiting at the altar.\n \"He wrote it,\" Heidi whispered back.\n Lauren kept walking down the aisle on the arm of Big Jim, who was giving her away. He wore a smile broader than Texas as he handed her over to the groom.\n The vows were as beautiful as the song that had accompanied the bride\u0027s progress. Mark and Lauren had written their vows themselves. Not everyone in attendance fully understood them, but many there did. The promise to love through eternity, come what may. The vow that love was undying. The usual words in some ways...dramatically different in others.\n They left the church in a rain of rice and cheers.\n The reception was held on the grounds of Montresse House, where the smells of barbecue and gumbo fought for dominance. As afternoon turned to evening, Big Jim\u0027s band jammed, and the groom even joined them for a while, until he saw his bride watching him with something private in her eyes.\n Then he was done playing. He left the stage and walked over to her.\n \"The truth, the whole truth,\" he told her, \"is that I love you.\"\n She laughed and said, \"I would never doubt you.\"\n The moon glowed down, and it seemed as if they were dancing on brilliant white clouds and that they would do so forever.\n Perhaps some things were eternal. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-red/page-19.html","bookId":2266,"book":{"id":2266,"title":"Blood Red","description":"Storyline: \n When a fortune-teller shows bridesmaid Lauren Crow an omen of her gruesome death, she and her friends laugh it off as cheesy theatrics--until women begin disappearing in the night. Even as the streets become more dangerous, Lauren finds herself lusting after a man who is himself dangerous-- and quite possibly crazy. Mark Davidson prowls the city by night armed with crosses and holy water, in search of vampires, whose existence, he insists, is real. He is as irresistibly drawn to Lauren as she is to him, and not only because she\u0027s the image of his murdered fiancee. But Mark\u0027s frightening obsession with finding his lover\u0027s killer merely hides a bitter vendetta that cuts deeper than grief over a lost love. \n As Lauren wrestles with desire and disbelief, sinister shadows lengthen over New Orleans, threatening her friends and foretelling a battle that may spell the end of the city\u0027s uneasy truce between the living and the undead.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/blood-red.jpg","author":"Heather Graham","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/blood-red.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:31 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:23:02 PM"}}
