{"id":87654,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"Lauren signed the registration cards for the inn and left feeling filled with energy, determined to find the fortune-teller at Jackson Square. But she realized, after walking around the square several times, that apparently many of the people who worked the area didn\u0027t show up until later, probably not until dusk, at least. More upsettingly, she had the feeling she was being followed, even though it was broad daylight. The sun was strong, the air warm, and there was a slight breeze off the river. The world seemed calm, normal. But it wasn\u0027t. She returned to the hospital, thinking that Heidi was probably ready to wring her neck. But Heidi wasn\u0027t irate in the least. She was sleeping in the chair by the bed when Lauren arrived. She didn\u0027t wake up until Lauren touched her, and then she flushed and stretched, and seemed disoriented. \"Hey, how\u0027s she doing? Has anyone said anything?\" Heidi seemed a little flustered when she replied. \"Um...yes, actually. The last nurse who came in here said that her vital signs are strong and that she\u0027s doing well. She hasn\u0027t come to yet, but she seems to be resting comfortably and I guess the doctors are pleased with her progress.\" \"I\u0027m sorry. I didn\u0027t mean to be gone so long.\" \"Were you gone long?\" Heidi asked. \"Yes. But the new place is gorgeous.\" \"So was the old place,\" Heidi pointed out. \"You\u0027ll love Montresse House. I promise,\" Lauren assured her. Heidi shrugged. \"It\u0027s what you wanted.\" \"Thanks for humoring me.\" \"Some slave you are.\" \"Sorry.\" Heidi frowned for a moment. \"There\u0027s still a cop in the hall, right?\" \"Yes, of course.\" \"Think we could go to lunch together? We missed breakfast, and I\u0027m starving.\" Lauren hesitated. It was broad daylight, she reminded herself. Deanna was in a hospital, with a cop right outside her door. \"Want to grab something in the hospital cafeteria?\" \"Not really, but okay.\" In the hallway, Lauren saw that the officer on duty was about fifty and appeared to be of French or Hispanic descent. He had a trustworthy face, a little haggard, but gentle and reassuring. When she told him they were going to grab a bite to eat together, he said, \"Good idea. I\u0027ll sit inside with your friend. You take your time.\" Lauren thanked him, noticing a heavy gold chain around his neck. \"Crucifix?\" she asked. \"Uh-yeah, actually.\" He drew it out from beneath his collar. \"A gift from my missus. I always wear it. I like yours, too.\" \"So you are wearing Mark\u0027s cross,\" Heidi teased. Lauren offered her a vague smile and thanked the officer. In the cafeteria, they discovered that the hospital offered a pretty decent salad bar. They filled their plates, then sat down at a table. \"I really am sorry that your party has gone south. Mostly, I\u0027m worried about Deanna, though,\" Lauren said. \"Oh, don\u0027t worry. I think that not being able to party hearty has been a good thing. I\u0027ve had time to think about what I\u0027m doing,\" Heidi said lightly. \"What do you mean?\" Lauren asked. Heidi shrugged. \"I\u0027ve been rethinking the entire marriage thing,\" she said. Lauren, with a small wedge of lettuce halfway to her lips, froze. \"What?\" she said in astonishment. \"Marriage. I don\u0027t know if I\u0027m ready.\" \"Heidi, your wedding is two weeks away.\" \"I know.\" Heidi, unconcerned, adjusted her napkin on her lap. \"Heidi, you love Barry.\" \"Well, of course, I love him.\" \"Then...?\" \"I\u0027ve just been thinking. I\u0027m not sure I\u0027m ready.\" \"But you were so certain.\" \"There you go. Things change.\" \"Have you talked to him? Did you two get into an argument or something?\" Lauren asked, perplexed. \"No, I wouldn\u0027t dream of fighting with him over the phone, and anyway, we don\u0027t have fights. Disagreements now and then, but no big fights.\" \"Have you talked to him at all?\" \"Not since yesterday.\" \"Then what...?\" \"I\u0027m just not sure I\u0027m really ready for marriage.\" She flushed, staring at Lauren. \"If you must know, it\u0027s occurred to me that I\u0027m not entirely positive I\u0027m ready for a sexually monogamous life.\" Lauren just stared at her blankly. \"Uh...well....\" \"We don\u0027t need to discuss it,\" Heidi snapped. \"Okay.\" Heidi set her fork down. \"I\u0027m not really hungry after all. Since you\u0027re here now, I think I\u0027ll head out. I\u0027ll go and make sure that we didn\u0027t leave anything at the old place and check out the new one. Okay?\" Heidi wasn\u0027t really asking; she was leaving. That was that. \"Okay.\" Lauren wasn\u0027t sure that Heidi even heard her. She was already walking out. Lauren discovered that she wasn\u0027t hungry herself and felt a sudden urge to get back to Deanna as quickly as possible. She rushed back upstairs. The friendly officer was still in the room. He blushed when she caught him reading Heidi\u0027s bridal magazine. \"Some really pretty pictures in there,\" he said. \"My wife and I eloped to Vegas. Sometimes I think I cheated her out of a real wedding.\" \"How long have you been married?\" \"Twenty-six years.\" \"I guess she was happy with what she got, then,\" Lauren assured him. He smiled. A happy man. Feeling that maybe the world would be all right, Lauren took a seat at the foot of Deanna\u0027s bed. The officer remained with her, and she never even noticed herself dozing off, but. the next she knew, he was nudging her and telling her that the shift was changing. She woke, blinked and realized it was twilight. Lauren wasn\u0027t sure if she would really have left Heidi alone at the hospital all night in her determination to find the fortune teller, but luckily she didn\u0027t have to worry about it, because Heidi reappeared in time Lauren\u0027s head was still reeling. Deanna was holding her own, but Heidi\u0027s behavior was beyond peculiar. She had returned to the hospital in a very pleasant if somewhat...fey mood. Not a word Lauren usually used, but it was one that seemed to describe the way Heidi was acting. She had mentioned avoiding several calls from Barry, and said blithely that Deanna was going to be just fine and she would be happy as a little lark to stay with her and watch television or read for the evening. When Lauren promised that she would return as soon as she could, Heidi told her not to worry. Lauren couldn\u0027t help but feel a little uneasy about leaving Heidi in charge, so to speak, then told herself that she was being ridiculous. There was a cop on constant duty at the door, and he was certainly capable of protecting both women if there should be any need. After leaving the hospital, Lauren found the nicest taxi driver in the world and asked him to take her to Montresse House, because she\u0027d decided to pick up a light jacket before hitting Jackson Square. The driver was a native of the area and sympathized with her for having a friend being in the hospital. Healso believed in the occult and told her that she should buy herself some serious mojo to protest against evil. She thanked him while privately thinking there was no need to get carried away. Unfortunately, as nice as he was, he wasn\u0027t able to get her all the way to Montresse House or even to Bourbon Street. There had been an accident, and the streets were blocked off. He apologized profusely but suggested she get out a few blocks away and walk. Lauren did, though she wasn\u0027t sure exactly where she was. There were people around, and there were lights, and she wasn\u0027t particularly worried. As she walked, she kept going over everything they\u0027d done since arriving in the city. A chill seemed to wrap itself around her suddenly, and she stopped walking. Frowning, she paused, looking around. The street was lined with old residences, with only a few storefronts here and there, and most of them were cafes that only served by day. Magnificent houses sat behind high walls, with bushes lining the sidewalk for added privacy,, and it seemed they had all begun to rustle. She quickened her pace. Then she stopped. Someone had stepped out from behind a high brick wall. Someone who was tall and formed a dark silhouette against the night. She could hear the distant sound of traffic. Laughter. Even music. She stood dead still. A breeze wafted by, strangely cool. She became aware that she was alone on the street. Doors and gates were closed. She wasn\u0027t far from Bourbon Street, but she might as well have been at the end of the world. The silhouette wasn\u0027t moving, exactly, or at least not in any way she could identify, yet it seemed to be coming closer to her, almost floating just inches above the sidewalk. Then, suddenly, the dark figure became a man, just a man. Tall, mid-thirties, athletic build, dark. He wore black jeans, a black polo shirt and a casual jacket. His hair seemed to be darker than the night. And his eyes... They might have been black, too. Except there seemed to be some kind of a glowing golden light in them. She told herself to move, to quicken her pace; to hurry past the man, then realized for the first time she was standing dead still. And he was smiling as he approached her. She could hear the blare of a horn from somewhere, but it might as well have come from another world. It was followed by the plaintive sound of a jazz chord. But it was so far away. \"Hello.\" Her heart seemed shudder as he spoke. She didn\u0027t understand why she wasn\u0027t moving. It was as if her limbs had become paralyzed. She was furious with herself. What the hell was the matter with her? His voice was deep and smooth. She wondered if that was part of what held her so firmly where she was. But she had been standing still, just waiting, before he had spoken. She didn\u0027t reply. She just stared at him, and he stared back. \"I\u0027ve been looking for you,\" he said. He\u0027d been looking for her? Ridiculous. She\u0027d never seen him before. Or had she? At that moment, she knew that she had seen him before; she just couldn\u0027t place where or when. To her amazement, she managed to speak. \"I don\u0027t know you,\" she said. If she tried really hard, she thought, she could probably move. \"But I know you. And you will remember me in time.\" It was the worst pick-up line she\u0027d ever heard, she thought. \"Excuse me, I have to get going,\" she murmured, and moved an arm. She could move! But when she managed a step, he was suddenly directly in front of her, even though she hadn\u0027t seen him move. It was as if he had floated there. She stared into his eyes. They were gold. No, they were dark. No, there was some kind of fire that seemed to glow from within them. That was it. She really had lost her mind. \"This time,\" he said softly, \"I have the advantage. I will not lose you again.\" She opened her mouth to speak. She wanted to protest that he couldn\u0027t lose what he didn\u0027t have. But the fire in his eyes was so bright.... The cross, she thought. The silver cross. If she could just produce it... No, that would mean that she believed in vampires, and that was ridiculous. Besides, she couldn\u0027t move her arms again. She was held by the fire in his eyes. She willed her hand to move, pleaded with her body to function.... She found the cross with her fingers and drew it out from under her shirt. A flash of fury seemed to tear through his eyes. He opened his mouth. His teeth weren\u0027t yellowed; they weren\u0027t horrid, rank or dripping with gore. They weren\u0027t teeth at all. They were fangs. She willed herself to back away. Because now he was coming right at her, furious at the sight of the cross. He started to reach out for her, as if he were in pain but planning to endure that pain. He was going to seize her cross and rip it from her neck. And that was when Mark appeared. She didn\u0027t know where he had come from; he was just suddenly there. She felt his arms on her shoulders, felt him shove her out of the way. He was carrying, of all things, a squirt gun. A child\u0027s squirt gun. Then he lifted it and shot her attacker. There was steam, a hiss, accompanied by a roar of fury. The man with the burning eyes seemed to disappear in darkness and shadow, even as the sound of his voice remained. And suddenly, there on the street, so near to Bourbon and yet so far, there were suddenly scores of shadows, like moving pools of darkness. They took on form. And life. Mark tossed her something. Another squirt gun. She stared at him, still in shock, but somehow, she reflexively caught the toy. \"Don\u0027t let anyone get the cross. Start shooting,\" Mark ordered. Shooting? With a squirt gun? They were crowding around her now. So many of them. They were people. They had been shadows, but now they were people. A girl in a short skirt with a Betty Page haircut and cute freckles. A twenty-something guy in a Grateful Dead T-shirt. A man who looked like a James Bond wanna-be. A woman who was a dead ringer for the mom on Family Ties. Someone almost pounced on Mark. He struck out with a kick that would have done Jackie Chan proud. Hi attacker went flying back and struck a wall-hard-then just picked himself up and started coming again. Mark had whirled, and for a moment she thought he was shooting at her with the squirt gun, but he wasn\u0027t. She heard a cry of fury, followed by that awful hissing right behind her. She turned. A black form was turning to a pool of burning dust behind her. A girl hopped on Mark\u0027s back. He caught her with both hands, throwing her over his shoulder to the sidewalk. She looked like Pollyanna. He took dead aim between her eyes with his water pistol. Shot. She screamed. The hissing came first. Then there was a small burst of fire. And she was ash. Mark began to spin, a steady spray of water coming from his gun. Somewhere, there was jazz music. Somewhere, someone laughed. A car horn blared. The hissing continued, punctuated by screams of fury. \"Shoot!\" Mark thundered. \"Turn and shoot.\" She spun around. A man who looked like a long lost cavalier was almost on top of her. He looked so much like pictures of Charles II that shock almost caused her to hesitate. Her finger twitched. She pulled the trigger. Hiss... The man was just inches from her. He snarled and let out a cry of fury as he dissipated right in front of her, the picture of his open mouth, fangs gleaming, imprinted on her mind. She thought that she saw fire, gleaming through a skull, as he burst into flame.... She felt something at her back. A man was there, reaching for her throat. He touched the silver cross and screamed as his finger burned. He stared at her, his face knitting into a hideous mask of fury. Then she saw fire for an instant, and the mask of fury become a distorted skull. He exploded, and through the soot, she could see Mark, see that he had shot the man.. And then she heard what sounded like the flapping of wings, saw a rising of shadows. In seconds the street was quiet again. The sounds from Bourbon Street seemed to grow louder. Become real. And near. She was still standing on the sidewalk. She was still staring at a man. But now the man was Mark. She was shaking, still holding her own water pistol. He bought the good kind, she thought dryly. They held a lot of water. Kids would have a great time playing with them at a pool. But she wasn\u0027t a kid, and she wasn\u0027t at a pool. And already she was finding it almost impossible to believe what had just taken place. \"Are you all right?\" Mark asked. Was she all right? What was he, out of his mind? \"Am I all right?\" she repeated. \"Hell, no!\" He took a breath and offered a rueful smile. \"I\u0027m sorry. I meant, are you hurt? Did anything...did he touch you before I got here?\" She swallowed. She was suddenly shaking uncontrollably. \"No.\" He took a careful step toward her. \"I didn\u0027t see what I just saw,\" she whispered. \"You did,\" he told her. It was impossible. It had all been so fast. It couldn\u0027t have been real. She looked at the ground. It looked as if a careless gardener had lost dirt from a wheelbarrow as he had made his way down the street. He reached out, taking the water pistol from her hand as carefully as if it had been a real gun. \"We should get to Montresse House,\" he said gently. \"The house,\" she echoed, frowning. \"At least you\u0027re not passing out,\" he murmured. Those words suddenly gave her strength. And the little voice at the back of her mind that had whispered that there must be some veracity in the stories he had been telling her suddenly spoke up loudly. They existed. Vampires existed. \"Of course I\u0027m not going to pass out!\" she snapped. Right. She was shaking so hard that she could barely stand. \"Let\u0027s go,\" he said. \"To Montresse House?\" she asked. \"Yes.\" \"Of course,\" she said, the light dawning. \"You have a room there, too, don\u0027t you?\" \"Yes.\" \"Deanna\u0027s been bitten by a vampire, hasn\u0027t she.\" It was a statement, not a question. She was still having trouble digesting the fact that vampires were real. \"Yes.\" \"Will she live?\" \"I hope so.\" She started walking, her movements jerky. She felt as if she had become a puppet, a marionette, and wasn\u0027t really moving of her own volition. As he walked at her side, it occurred to her that he had come in the nick of time. That he had saved her life. They were almost on Bourbon Street by then, and there were people everywhere, talking, laughing. A drunk passed her, and he was wonderful. He was real. Normal. \"You\u0027ve been following me,\" she said accusingly, stopping and turning on him. \"Whenever I\u0027ve been able to,\" he said, stopping, too. She was tempted to hit him. \"You were late!\" \"I thought you were at the hospital. I came as soon as I got word that you\u0027d left,\" he told her. She wanted him to hold her. She wanted to crawl into his arms. No, she wanted him to be normal, too. She desperately needed to take a step back. She opened her mouth to speak. There was so much to say, to demand to know. But nothing came out. She didn\u0027t know where to start. She took a step toward him, then another. She leaned against him. He seemed solid. Strong. His arms came around her, holding her, and she stood there, shaking. Oh, God, it was so much better here.... She laid a hand on his shirt, feeling the strength of his body was through the fabric. She had wanted to be near him, but she had been afraid. Even now, she didn\u0027t dare trust him, even if... Even if he had saved her life. But she needed the clean, male scent of him, the vital strength of his form.... The sound of his voice. Oh, God, it would be so easy to... She pulled away from him and started walking again. They reached the house on Bourbon Street, and all of a sudden the air seemed to be full of birds. Masses of birds. Or bats. Or winged shadows. Mark saw them, too, and his face tensed. But he didn\u0027t appear to be afraid. Instead, he looked angry. \"Open the gate,\" he said softly. She did, and the birds or bats, or shadows, continued to hover overhead. But they didn\u0027t come closer. She and Mark walked up the pathway to the house. The front door opened before they were even half way there. \"Come in, come in, and hurry, please,\" Stacey said. It was evident that she\u0027d already met Mark. \"What happened?\" she demanded. \"Stephan made his first real play for Lauren,\" Mark explained. \"Oh, my God, where? When?\" She looked at Lauren suspiciously. \"He didn\u0027t...?\" \"No,\" Mark told her. \"But he\u0027s getting bolder. She was right off Bourbon.\" Stacey let out a sigh. \"Was he alone?\" \"No. He has an army with him, just as I predicted,\" Mark said. Lauren stared from one of them to the other. They were talking as if the city were under siege, and by an enemy they had fought before. \"A regular infestation,\" Stacey muttered. Then she saw the way that Lauren was staring at her and smiled, shrugging her shoulders. \"I assume now you understand the rule about not inviting anyone in, anyone at all.\" \"Yeah, I understand,\" Lauren said. Because she did. They were insane. And she was insane, too, because she was seeing what they saw. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" she murmured. \"I\u0027m trying so hard to...\" \"To believe what\u0027s unbelievable,\" Stacey said. \"So you do believe that vampires exist?\" Lauren said. \"Of course,\" Stacey told her. \"But....\" Stacey shook her head, staring at Lauren. \"But why doesn\u0027t the world know? You\u0027ve just seen them-and you still don\u0027t completely believe. And,\" she said, and hesitated, looking at Mark, \"I think that Mr. Davidson could tell you that there are plenty of vampires out there who are living their lives in as normal a manner as possible, hurting no one. But there are also those who...\" Again, she paused. \"There are people, regular people, who are psychotic. Cold-blooded killers. It\u0027s no different in the world of the undead.\" \"The undead,\" Lauren murmured slowly. \"In other words, I may already know some vampires, good vampires, and I just don\u0027t realize it.\" \"Maybe.\" Stacey said. \"Many exist without their closest friends knowing the truth.\" \"Sure they do,\" Lauren said skeptically. \"I know that this is a lot to take in,\" Mark said. \"But the important thing is, you\u0027re safe here,\" Stacey said. \"Big Jim sleeps out in the caretaker\u0027s cottage, Bobby is here a lot of the time, and I\u0027ve been through this myself before. Our only weaknesses can come from within.\" Lauren stared at them. \"Lieutenant Canady told us to come here. Are you telling me that a police lieutenant believes in vampires?\" \"Yes,\" Mark told her. \"His wife used to be one,\" Stacey explained matter-of-factly. \"Used to be?\" Lauren said. \"No one really understands what happened there, but Maggie was a vampire. For years and years. Then Sean came into her life, they had a major battle with a really vicious enemy, and then...she was human again. It was really great for Maggie, because she desperately wanted to have a family. It\u0027s different with Jessica Fraser, who owns this place. She\u0027s vampire, too. A good one, of course.\" \"Of course.\" \"That\u0027s why Sean sent you here,\" Stacey explained. \"We know how to fight evil. We\u0027ve all fought vampires before.\" \"The bad ones, of course,\" Lauren murmured. \"Of course,\" Stacey said, gravely serious. Could this nightmare be real? Lauren wondered. When she\u0027d woken up just a few days ago, the world had been spinning on its axis, and, though they\u0027d had their problems, they had all been... Sane. But now... Mark Davidson set a hand on her shoulder, and she looked up into his eyes. Serious eyes, striking eyes, eyes that had practically hypnotized her from the start. \"It will be all right. I don\u0027t intend to stop until I\u0027ve taken Stephan down, and it won\u0027t matter how many servants he has running around, doing his bidding.\" \"Right.\" She knew she sounded exhausted and disbelieving, and she didn\u0027t care. \"I need a shower,\" he said. For the first time she noticed that there was black, sooty, stuff all over his shirt. She realized that she was covered withg it, as well. It was death. Ashes to ashes. Dust to dust. She was literally wearing the evil of untold years. Realization hit her, and suddenly she thought she was going to pass out. She remembered where she had seen the man who had accosted her on the street before. She had seen him in the crystal ball.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-red/page-9.html","bookId":2266,"book":{"id":2266,"title":"Blood Red","description":"Storyline: When a fortune-teller shows bridesmaid Lauren Crow an omen of her gruesome death, she and her friends laugh it off as cheesy theatrics--until women begin disappearing in the night.
