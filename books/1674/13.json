Whoever the individual was who\u0027d been carrying me dumped me unceremoniously onto my feet.\n I looked around and didn\u0027t immediately see Evaline, although I\u0027d watched her run out onto the street behind us. However, just a short distance away was a cluster of very confused, frightened young women. The Society of Sekhmet had been evacuated. She was probably in the midst of the girls. Just then, the sound of sirens screeching filled the air. The police or firemen.\n The young man who\u0027d carried me out, whose torso was bared by the vest that identified him as one of the opium servers, spun to look behind him. \"Bloody \u0027ell! I\u0027m gone.\" Before I could thank him for his assistance, he took himself off.\n I stood there for a moment, still panting, and looked up. The fire in the upper floors would devastate, but the building wouldn\u0027t come down. It was brick. Surely someone as clever as the Ankh would find an escape.\n Which meant that this wasn\u0027t over.\n The sky-anchors swayed high above, large dark balloons bumping against each other in the breeze. As I watched, one of them detached itself from the others. It happened occasionally that one of the moorings loosened, and streetwatchers would announce it with cries of \"Cut loose! It\u0027s cut loose!\" and there would be wagers on how long it would be buffeted about in the sky and where it would land.\n Then comprehension dawned. The stage, the entire stage in the opium den, had been a sort of airship. The steps, in all four directions, had actually been folded sides, collapsed onto the floor. Now they\u0027d been raised and the entire stage lifted . . . and was being piloted up and out of the open roof. I watched with a combination of admiration and annoyance that I hadn\u0027t observed this earlier.\n \"Miss Holmes!\"\n A familiar peremptory voice had me spinning around.\n \"This is becoming quite a habit, is it not? Encountering you in the thick of criminal activity.\" Inspector Grayling stood there, radiating exasperation. \"You promised not to come here tonight.\"\n \"I didn\u0027t promise any such thing,\" I told him. \"I merely said-wait!\" I cried, struck by a realization. \"I must get to Cosgrove Terrace.\" This was my chance to catch Lady Cosgrove-Pitt in the act-or, more accurately, not to. She wouldn\u0027t be there. She couldn\u0027t be. \"Quickly!\"\n \"What is it?\" he asked, his pique easing in the face of my desperate entreaty.\n \"It\u0027s-it\u0027s a matter of life and death,\" I said. I couldn\u0027t explain it to him; he wouldn\u0027t believe me. He wouldn\u0027t want to believe the awful truth about his relative.\n I\u0027d have to show him.\n It was to Grayling\u0027s credit-and I suppose mine-that he didn\u0027t hesitate. \"This way,\" he said, taking my arm when I whirled to hail an air-bus. \"It\u0027s faster.\"\n With a little more force than necessary, he directed me to the large, gleaming steamcycle. It appeared even more dangerous at close proximity. I swallowed hard.\n \"Put these on,\" he said, shoving an aviator hat and a pair of goggles at me.\n Then he climbed onto the machine, straddling it as one would a horse. His long coat split over the seat, falling in two black swatches. For the first time, I noticed how long and powerful Grayling\u0027s limbs were and I realized, with a sudden shock of heat and nerves, that I was going to have to sit behind him. And hold on.\n I couldn\u0027t breathe.\n \"I . . .\"\n \"Miss Holmes,\" he said with challenge in his eyes, \"a matter of life and death cannot wait for you to build up your courage.\"\n Drat. He was right. I had to get to Cosgrove Terrace to prove that Lady Cosgrove-Pitt was the Ankh. I pulled the aviator cap down over my head and arranged the goggles as he did something to the machine.\n Its engine came to life with a spectacular roar, then settled into a rhythmic, metallic purr. Steeling myself, I climbed onto the seat behind him, thankful I had had the foresight to wear the new split skirts I\u0027d had made, like Miss Stoker\u0027s. I couldn\u0027t imagine what a spectacle I would have made of myself otherwise.\n \"Hold on,\" he said, and the engine gave another loud roar. I could feel it charge and vibrate beneath me, and I realized he was waiting for me to hold on to him.\n Thankful my face was hidden by the goggles and that I was behind him, I placed my hands gingerly at his waist, curling my fingers into his wool coat.\n The cycle roared again, then surged forward. I jolted backward and, stifling a shriek, gripped his coat more tightly as I leaned toward him. The warmth of his body melded into me as a sharp wind blasted over my arms and skirted legs.\n We rounded a corner at full speed. I slipped to one side on the seat and nearly tumbled off. Terrified, I gave up on propriety and gave in to practicality, changing my position to wrap my arms around his torso, grabbing my wrist with my other hand. This position required me to rest my cheek against Grayling\u0027s back, filling my nose with the pleasing aroma of wood-smoked wool.\n I felt the muscles of his torso shift and slide as he manipulated the cycle, and only after what seemed like forever did I realize I had my eyes closed.\n Cautiously, I opened them and peered down from behind the green-tinted goggles. The first thing I saw was my leg curved forward, directly behind his as my split skirt blustered wildly about. Thank Fortune I was wearing pantaloons beneath it. Beyond that, I saw part of the brass detail curving around the cycle. We were moving so fast that everything else, including the ground some distance below, was a blur.\n I\u0027d never traveled anywhere at this speed. Cool air roared over me as we slipped in and out of alleys and over canals, beneath air-lifts and among carriages with the dexterity of a cat. I even lifted my face away from Grayling\u0027s warm spine and eased my death grip around his waist. It was exhilarating.\n And then, suddenly, there was a brick wall. Right there.\n I closed my eyes and ducked instinctively as Grayling\u0027s arm jerked. The cycle turned, tipping to the side so acutely I had to cling even more tightly to him.\n I kept my eyes closed, deciding it was better I didn\u0027t see where we were going as we zigzagged through the streets, the roar of the machine filling my ears, its rumble buzzing through my limbs.\n At last, it slowed and the roar eased. I opened my eyes to see Cosgrove Terrace, and my heart began to race for different reasons. Grayling drove the cycle up to the front entrance and parked just below the rise of three main steps. This was a different entrance than the one we\u0027d used during the Roses Ball, but just as grand.\n I climbed off the vehicle. My knees shook, and my body vibrated as if I was still riding the machine. And yet . . . I glanced at the steamcycle. During the moments I\u0027d had my eyes open, the speed and maneuverability had been exciting.\n Avoiding Grayling\u0027s glance, I pulled off the aviator cap and goggles. I wasn\u0027t going to worry about the condition of my hair. After a long night of wearing a bonnet with a wig and then the ensuing altercation with the Ankh, I couldn\u0027t imagine that an aviator cap would have worsened the situation.\n After all, Lady Cosgrove-Pitt had already seen me.\n Grayling walked to the door with me and rang the bell. \"Is Lord Cosgrove-Pitt in danger? Or Lady Isabella? Have you received some information from your father?\"\n Shaking my head, I waited with complacence. Thanks to Grayling\u0027s speedy vehicle, it would be impossible for Lady Isabella to have arrived at Cosgrove Terrace before we did, even if she had an inkling that I might come here. She wasn\u0027t going to be inside, and her absence was going to be the first piece of evidence against her.\n The door swung open before I had the opportunity to respond to Grayling\u0027s question, which was a good thing, because what precisely was I going to tell him? That his distant relative had been murdering young women in order to resurrect an Egyptian goddess from the ether?\n \"Good evening, Dusenbery, I need to speak with Lord Belmont or Lady Isabella.\"\n \"It\u0027s urgent that we speak to Lady Cosgrove-Pitt immediately,\" I said.\n \"Of course, Inspector Grayling. And Miss . . . er . . . ?\" The butler stepped back, giving us entrance.\n I didn\u0027t offer my name. I saw no reason to give Lady Isabella or anyone else warning that I was there. When Dusenbery seemed to hesitate-perhaps waiting for me to do so-I pressed, \"It\u0027s quite urgent. Is Lady Isabella in?\" Since it was well into the early hours of the morning, it would be odd for her not to be in, even if she\u0027d attended a party or the theater.\n \"Lord Belmont is at his club,\" Dusenbery said, looking at Grayling instead of me. I\u0027m certain the only reason he was so forthcoming with that information was because my companion was both a relative and from the authorities. \"I shall see if Lady Isabella will see you.\"\n \"We\u0027ll wait in the parlor,\" Grayling told Dusenbery.\n \"I\u0027d prefer to wait here,\" I said. It would be easier to see or hear anything else happening in the house if we remained in the foyer.\n \"Very well,\" said Dusenbery as he turned, presumably to hunt down Lady Isabella.\n I chafed at the delay, yet at the same time, I felt a strange calm settle over me. Lady Isabella wouldn\u0027t see us, of course, because she wasn\u0027t here.\n And even if she happened to arrive in the next few moments-which in itself was unlikely; after all, she\u0027d been air-lifted from a roof on the other side of the city-she\u0027d be unable to change her clothing and otherwise hide the traces of her secret identity.\n I was going to have to induce Grayling to search the house if Lady Isabella \"refused\" to see us-that is, when the butler found that she wasn\u0027t in residence after all.\n \"Miss Holmes,\" said my companion, looking down at me from his excessive height, \"will you please provide me some explanation for this?\" His hair was ruffled from the ride, and I couldn\u0027t help but remember how my legs had pressed into the underside of his. And how well he\u0027d managed that monstrous machine.\n I heard the sound of footsteps.\n \"Ambrose! Whatever is wrong? What are you doing here at this time of the night?\"\n My heart dropped to my feet at the sound of Lady Isabella\u0027s voice. I whirled, the inability to hide my shock surely evident in my expression. My whole body had gone cold and numb. \"Lady Cosgrove-Pitt. You\u0027re here.\" My lips hardly moved.\n Impossible.\n \"But of course I\u0027m here.\" Her eyes went from me to Grayling and back again, a bemused, confused look in them. My face heated to a fiery temperature as the rest of my person remained icy. \"It\u0027s nearly one o\u0027clock in the morning.\"\n I examined her desperately, searching for any sign she\u0027d just been in the midst of a fire. She was wearing a long night rail and a loose housecoat, and her hair was braided in one single plait that hung over her shoulder. I saw no trace of makeup nor any debris on her slippered feet.\n How could I be wrong?\n \"I\u0027m sorry to bother you, Lady Isabella,\" Grayling said. I could hear the stiffness in his voice and feel his confusion as he looked at me. \"Miss Holmes-er-we believed it was an urgent matter.\"\n I found my voice at last. \"I just learned about Lilly Corteville. I wanted to express my condolences. I understand you were close to the family.\" I could think of nothing else to say, and Grayling\u0027s heavy regard continued to weigh me down.\n Lady Isabella looked at me. I looked back at her, searching in vain for something in her eyes, some sort of recognition that we\u0027d been face-to-face less than an hour ago.\n \"Yes, indeed. What a tragedy that was,\" she said in a soothing voice that conveyed confusion. \"That was your purpose for rousting me from my bed?\"\n \"I-I apologize, my lady. I . . . er . . . didn\u0027t realize how late it was.\"\n \"My apologies as well, Lady Isabella,\" said Grayling. \"We\u0027ll be off now. Please give Uncle Belmont my regards.\"\n \"Of course,\" said the gracious lady.\n No sooner had the door closed behind us than Grayling gave me a long, inscrutable look. To my surprise, it was neither condemning nor angry. It was . . . exasperated and a little bemused. And concerned.\n \"If I didn\u0027t know any better, I\u0027d think you simply wanted an excuse to ride on the steamcycle.\"\n I couldn\u0027t look at him.\n I\u0027d been wrong.\n Very wrong.\n How could I have made such a mistake? \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-clockwork-scarab-stoker-holmes-1/page-13.html","bookId":1674,"book":{"id":1674,"title":"The Clockwork Scarab (Stoker \u0026 Holmes #1)","description":"Storyline: \n The Clockwork Scarab (Stoker \u0026 Holmes #1) \n Evaline Stoker and Mina Holmes never meant to get into the family business.
