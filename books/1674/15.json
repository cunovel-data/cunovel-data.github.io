{"id":62748,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"Miss Holmes An Impossible Choice Dylan arrived at my house just before eleven o\u0027clock, carrying a heavy satchel. Ignoring Mrs. Raskill\u0027s muttering about more comings and goings, I brought him into the parlor so he could show me the diadem. He greeted me with a smile and seemed to be moving toward me as if to offer an embrace, but caught himself at the last minute. A light stain flushed his cheeks, and he stepped back. \"You\u0027re wearing pants.\" The way his eyes traveled over my trouser-covered limbs made me self-conscious about the way the fabric clung to my shape. I felt indecent and exposed, and the way his blue eyes filtered over me made my cheeks heat up. \"I . . . erm . . .\" He smiled and sat down without waiting for me to do so first. \"I didn\u0027t mean to embarrass you, Mina. I was just surprised. You look really hot-uh, really good in pants. In my time, girls-women-wear them all the time. It\u0027s considered completely normal.\" My discomfort eased in favor of curiosity. \"Is that true? Women can wear trousers in the future without it being frowned upon?\" \"And a lot of other things you\u0027d find scandalous. Like short skirts,\" he added with a bashful grin. I bit my lip, holding back more questions that bubbled to the surface. It never seemed the right time to ask him all the things I wanted to know. I\u0027d have to save my interrogation for another time-when I didn\u0027t have a friend\u0027s life to save. \"Very well,\" I said. \"Back to the matter at hand. I\u0027m relieved you located the diadem. It\u0027s a most fortuitous discovery, considering the development of the last twenty-four hours.\" I explained the events of the night before, leaving out my disastrous detour to Lady Cosgrove-Pitt\u0027s house. \"And so I\u0027m going to deliver the diadem to the Ankh.\" \"And I\u0027ll be going with you,\" Dylan said. He raised a hand at my sound of negation, his blue eyes boring into me. \"I\u0027ve been stuck in the darned museum for almost two weeks, and it\u0027s time I did something besides sulk. You can\u0027t go alone, Mina. And it\u0027s not because you\u0027re a woman,\" he added when I began to fume. \"Remind me to tell you about Amelia Earhart and Jane Goodall someday. Going alone would be crazy, especially after last night. You should have taken me with you, or at least told the police. And besides all that, if the statue of Sekhmet is there, I want to see it. Maybe I can find a way to use it to get home.\" I had a variety of reactions to this pronouncement. First, I found I rather liked this Dylan who spoke with such strength and passion. Who didn\u0027t think that simply being a woman was a reason not to go alone. And who liked the way I looked in trousers. And second, I had a sudden, brilliant idea with which only he could assist me. And third . . . I felt an unexpected pang at the thought of Dylan finding his way back to the future. Just as I was getting to know him, to feel as if we had some sort of connection, he might be leaving. I hadn\u0027t felt such kinship with another person in a long time. Perhaps ever. \"Naturally I can\u0027t tell Scotland Yard about this,\" I said. \"The Ankh is too smart; surely she\u0027ll be watching for us when we arrive to make the exchange. If there are any authorities in the vicinity, I\u0027m certain the deal will be off. Will you show me the diadem?\" Dylan pulled the item out of his satchel, and I examined it eagerly. It looked exactly like the drawing in the text I\u0027d been reading. There was no doubt that, regardless whether it had actually belonged to Sekhmet or not, it was the instrument of legend. Delicate gold filigree created a very un-Egyptian-like crown. Two topazes were set in such a way in the front of the crown that they appeared to be lion\u0027s eyes, and the slender gold was wrought in the shape of a lioness\u0027s snout and whiskers. \"It was where we thought it was, wasn\u0027t it?\" I couldn\u0027t allow the Ankh to have it. There had to be another way. I\u0027d make a copy. I had the equipment in my lab, and we had at least another hour before my acceptance of the Ankh\u0027s arrangement was delivered. \"Do you have your special telephone with you?\" I asked, my mind working again on the half-formed plan I\u0027d already been considering. \"Yes, although it\u0027s low on battery, so I\u0027ve had it turned off for most of the last week. I have to find a way to charge it. But I can still use it.\" \"Can you force it to emit sounds and noises at will?\" \"I sure can.\" \"Come into the laboratory. I\u0027ll tell you my plan while I work.\" I needed something to occupy my hands as well as my mind while we waited to hear of Evaline. Time crawled, and it was well after five o\u0027clock when Mrs. Raskill interrupted us. \"It\u0027s your visitor again,\" she said, poking her head around the ajar door. \"Lands!\" Finally. I\u0027d been unable to contain my growing apprehension for Evaline and her safety. \"At last we\u0027ll find out how to make the exchange,\" I said to Dylan, gesturing at the false diadem. It required only a few more adjustments, and I was confident it would easily pass muster as the instrument in question. I hurried out of the laboratory, wiping my hands on a rag, and then stopped short. \"Inspector Grayling.\" Drat! \"Good afternoon, Miss Holmes,\" he said, his voice cool and unemotional as he held his hat in a large, freckled hand. His eyes widened fractionally, however, as they swept over me in my masculine garb, bringing a warm flush to my cheeks. Dylan might be accustomed to seeing women in trousers, but Grayling was not. \"How may I help you?\" I asked as Dylan appeared from behind me. Grayling\u0027s attention went to him and his expression turned stony. \"I\u0027ve come to take your statement regarding the events of last evening.\" He spoke to me, but seemed unable to pull his attention from Dylan. \"I\u0027m rather busy at the moment.\" \"Obviously,\" Grayling replied crisply. He returned his attention to Dylan. \"Have you been notified when you\u0027ll stand trial for the attempted break-in?\" I gawked at him, shocked by his rudeness, but Dylan didn\u0027t seem to mind. \"I\u0027ve been lucky. The museum isn\u0027t going to press charges, thanks to Miss Adler. She took care of it all before she left town.\" He glanced at me. \"I meant to tell you earlier-Miss Adler had to leave unexpectedly.\" I nodded and quelled an unfamiliar moment of uncertainty. My mentor was gone, and I was on my own. I\u0027d already made one grave error. . . . I stopped those thoughts and turned to Grayling. \"I have a rather delicate project I must finish today. Perhaps we could make an appointment to speak tomorrow?\" That was assuming I\u0027d be alive and able to speak tomorrow. I shoved that thought away. He fixed me with a steady look, then gave a short, sharp nod. \"Very well, Miss Holmes. Good day.\" We\u0027d hardly returned to the laboratory when Mrs. Raskill thudded on the door yet again. \"It\u0027s. Another. Visitor. Ye. \u0027Ave,\" she said, clearly capitalizing and punctuating each word. And the fact that she\u0027d dropped the h in have indicated her extreme exasperation. The same messenger who\u0027d come earlier stood at the front door. \"I\u0027ve got \u0027nother message fer ye.\" My attention swept over him once again, noting several changes to his appearance. Gray dusty grit on the outside of left shoe only-he\u0027d been on Pennington-street since he was here last. A shiny dark green stain low on his trousers, the faint scent of algae-he\u0027d been at the dockyards within the last hour. A red-and-green paper wrapper peeked from his trouser pocket-he\u0027d recently patronized Shertle\u0027s Meats for one of their meat pies. \"May I see the message?\" The folded packet\u0027s exterior was identical to the first. However, inside was a lock of dark, curling hair. There was no doubt to whom it belonged-Evaline\u0027s curls coiled in a clockwise direction and were a deep, shiny walnut color of this precise hue. I turned my attention to the message: You have until nine o\u0027clock this evening to bring the diadem to Fannery\u0027s Square. If you do not, Miss Stoker will embrace Sekhmet for all eternity. If you do not come alone, the deal is defunct, and she\u0027ll die. \"Are you to wait for a response again?\" I asked. \"Nay, miss. Except I\u0027m told ye\u0027d pay me fer my troubles.\" My mind was so busy analyzing my observations that I didn\u0027t have the attention to spare for being vexed by this assumption. I paid the young man, sent him on his way, and then returned my attention to the message and Miss Stoker\u0027s hair. I sniffed both the letter and her curls, and examined the latter on a piece of white paper. \"Where\u0027s Fannery\u0027s Square?\" asked Dylan, who\u0027d been reading over my shoulder. \"She\u0027s very clever. Oh, the Ankh is quite clever,\" I said, mulling over all I\u0027d absorbed since the young man returned. \"Fannery\u0027s Square is outside London by one hour. But the only way to get there is to take the train. The next train leaves at seven, and there is one more today at half past eight. The latter would get us to our destination too late, so we must take the seven o\u0027clock train.\" \"How long will it take us to get to the train station?\" I pinched my lower lip. The strange churning I always felt when I was getting close to something fascinating had begun in my belly. \"This means the Ankh wants to ensure we\u0027re on the seven o\u0027clock train, for some particular reason. That\u0027s why she waited so late in the day to send the message. She wants us in a particular location or on a particular route at a certain time. And everyone knows the Fannery train is precisely on time, so one must be at the station before seven.\" I paced the room. The churning had grown stronger, my belly tighter. I recalled my observations of the messenger, and the churning turned into more of a warning prickling. I didn\u0027t like it. \"Our messenger-who had to have received this message from the Ankh or someone close to her-was nowhere in the proximity of the Fannery line train today,\" I said. \"He was at the docks. He spent at least the latter part of the day there, because Shertle\u0027s Meats never serves their pies until after half past four. And his trousers-the gray debris on the left shoe indicates he was walking on Pennington-street. It\u0027s the only location that sort of concrete is being poured this week-I read about it in the Times. That\u0027s one block north of the Yeater Wharf. He didn\u0027t have time to go from Bond to Pennington and Shertle\u0027s after walking along there at noon, for the algae on his trousers is fresh. It hasn\u0027t yet dried.\" Dylan was staring at me as if I were speaking in some slang that was just as incomprehensible as some of the things he\u0027d said to me. \"So what does this all mean? In plain English?\" \"It means that I have a decision to make.\" I realized the churning, which was normally a comforting feeling, had turned into something akin to nausea. \"I either follow the instructions herein, or I go where our messenger was-and where he received this message. That\u0027s where the Ankh is.\" Suddenly the image of last night, with Lady Cosgrove-Pitt in her housecoat and her bemused expression rose in my mind like a terrible specter. Along with Grayling\u0027s exasperated, rigid face. The nausea grew stronger. \"I think.\" I don\u0027t believe I\u0027d ever said or even thought those words before. I think. Dylan watched me. \"So you\u0027re thinking we ignore the message and track down the Ankh somewhere . . . where? By the wharf? How will we know what building?\" \"I can narrow it down to a block,\" I said, thinking of the particular smell clinging to the lock of Evaline\u0027s hair. \"The one with the fish-smokers on New Gravel Lane. And as for which building? We\u0027ll look for the one with the airship coming out of the roof. Surely the Ankh won\u0027t risk leaving her Sekhmet statue behind.\" I glanced at him, my palms damp and my insides heavy and rock-like. That was what the facts told me. But the message-directions from the desperate woman who held my partner and who wanted the diadem above all else-commanded me otherwise. Yesterday, I wouldn\u0027t have hesitated. I\u0027d have listened to my deductions and ignored the message. But today . . . I had to decide whether to follow my instincts and my conclusions . . . or to follow directions and possibly put myself into a trap. But if I didn\u0027t follow the directions, I risked Evaline\u0027s life. Last night\u0027s mistake had been nothing more than mortifying and inconvenient. Today\u0027s decision was a matter of life and death. I looked at the clock, my insides roiling. After six. I had to make a decision. \"I can\u0027t risk it. We\u0027re going-\" I drew in a deep breath, fighting my logical mind. I made the decision and immediately felt ill. But I soldiered on. I couldn\u0027t afford to be wrong this time. \"We\u0027re following the directions. We\u0027re going to Fannery\u0027s Square.\" Miss Stoker Miss Stoker\u0027s Decision With the Ankh gone, I investigated my prison, limited as I was by the length of my bonds. I was looking for weapons or at least something to unlock the chains. One option was to pull the heavy statue over and unloop the chains from around her. While that would free me from that massive anchor, it wouldn\u0027t unlock my ankles or wrists. I\u0027d still be trussed. And whoever was below would hear the sound of Sekhmet crashing to the floor. There had to be another option. Two huge floor-to-ceiling windows offered dirty light, but I couldn\u0027t get close enough to draw attention to myself. The roof was closed to the sky, but I could tell it was near twilight. Chairs and tables lined the space, and an empty fireplace yawned in one wall. The faint glow of coals cast an eerie red light in the darkening chamber. A bookshelf and a desk were arranged at one end of the room. This had been an office at some point, but now there was a pile of clothing in a corner, as well as a trunk. The smell of rotting fish and the distant sounds of water told me I was near the wharf, in a completely different area of town than Witcherell\u0027s Pawnshop. I wondered if Pix considered these streets and docks part of his domain. Surely he was back in the stews, arm wrestling with his friends. From what I understood of his brief explanation in the opium den, he\u0027d come to rescue his friend Jemmy from the Ankh. And in the meantime, he got caught up with Miss Holmes and me. He had helped the other girls to escape too. And he\u0027d taken advantage of my confusion and stolen a kiss as well. Although Pix seemed to care about my well-being, he would have no way of knowing where and how I\u0027d come to be here, in the captivity of the Ankh. I looked around the room and at the altar. There was no doubt what the Ankh had planned for me. The mechanical device, with all of its wires, waited, eerie and foreboding, next to the sleek Sekhmet. Miss Holmes was going to bring the diadem, the real diadem, to trade for me, and then the Ankh would have it. She\u0027d have all the instruments. She\u0027d also have both of us. I wasn\u0027t a fool. No matter how intelligent my partner was, the Ankh was the one giving the orders. Setting up a trap. It didn\u0027t matter whether the goddess could be reanimated, or if her power could be harnessed. The Ankh didn\u0027t care. She\u0027d keep trying. She\u0027d already killed too many young women. She wasn\u0027t about to stop there. She\u0027d keep killing and killing until she managed to raise Sekhmet. . . . My path became clear. Crystal and absolute. I had to stop the Ankh before Miss Holmes stepped into the trap. I looked up at the statue of Sekhmet and then over at the mechanical device, its ugly wires a portent of what was to come. Yes. That was it. A feeling of calm and rightness settled over me. I\u0027d never been more certain of anything in my life. I was bound and restricted by the length of my chain, but I still had some range of motion. I inched toward the mechanical device and used my body to shift its position. It had to be in the correct location, and I could only hope the Ankh didn\u0027t notice. It was difficult work. I had to use my considerable strength to tug the massive statue a little closer to the device, taking care not to tip Sekhmet over. Not yet. By the time I got everything into position, I was out of breath but satisfied. No sooner had I finished with my arrangements than I heard the sounds of voices and footsteps. Quickly, I scooted my bound body back over to the opposite side of the statue and tried to appear docile and hopeless. \"The girl didn\u0027t go to the station,\" someone said as the door opened. \"We waited, and she didn\u0027t appear.\" The Ankh swept in, and I could feel his rage. He had changed clothing again, and this time was attired in trousers and a shapeless dark tunic. A low hat was settled down to his eyebrows, and a mask covered him from eyes to nose. A short dark beard shadowed his jaw and mouth. \"What does she mean to do?\" the Ankh said as he stalked into the chamber. He was followed by Hathor, Bastet, and Amunet. They couldn\u0027t find Miss Holmes. She\u0027d done something unexpected. Was she coming or not? I wasn\u0027t certain whether to be relieved or offended. \"It\u0027s nine o\u0027clock.\" The Ankh looked over at me, his eyes dark and furious from behind the mask. \"Your friend has recanted on our agreement. She\u0027s leaving you to die.\" \"She lied, you know,\" I said. \"She doesn\u0027t have the diadem. She intended to trick you all along.\" The Ankh swept over to the table. \"I\u0027ll find her and show her what happens to one who tries to trick me. She might have caused a delay, but in the end, I\u0027ll win. As for tonight-I shan\u0027t wait any longer. I have everything I need.\" He looked at me and then at the crown Amunet had placed on the table. \"This one will work. I\u0027m certain of it. And if it doesn\u0027t . . . I\u0027ll continue to search for the real one.\" I kept my eyelids hooded. I didn\u0027t want him to see I was ready. And willing. Because I was taking him with me. The Ankh conducted the same preparations as last night, and soon red smoke curled throughout the chamber. Hathor dragged me to my feet and, as Amunet kept a gun pressed into my side, he unbound my hands and one ankle, leaving the other still chained to the statue. If I made any sort of move, they\u0027d shoot me . . . but not to kill. I was meant to die another way, and the level of agony was up to me. The Ankh continued with his work, reading another chant to Sekhmet. This time, he didn\u0027t direct his words to the sky, but toward the large window. I could see Sekhmet\u0027s reflection in the glass as the sky darkened outside and the firelight inside our chamber glowed more brightly. I was forced to stand facing Sekhmet just as Della Exington had done. With a sharp wrench, Bastet forced my arm to mirror the statue\u0027s. The gold was cool and smooth against my bare skin. I kept my breathing calm as a thin wire running from the mechanical device was wrapped around my arm. It cut into my skin. I was going to die. And I was at peace. This was what I was meant to do, what my family legacy required of me: bravery, strength, and sacrifice. For the good and safety of all. I drew in a deep breath and looked at the gear-ridden, wired device. It was still where I\u0027d placed it. Hathor tightened another wire around my right arm, positioning it against Sekhmet\u0027s scepter, and then Bastet brought over the false diadem. I trembled a little as she positioned the crown on my head. I mentally reviewed the steps of my plan. Me. The one who never made plans. If only Miss Holmes were here to witness my brilliance. When the Ankh began to pull the lever, I would have a few brief seconds to lunge to the side. I\u0027d pull the heavy statue over with me . . . down and onto the Ankh. We\u0027d fall into the mechanical device together, and thus entwined, the Ankh and I would together give our life forces to a Sekhmet who would never rise. My pulse was faster now. The Ankh placed the dishes of smoking coals around the statue, and the fog rose around me like a red curtain. It was time. Which was worse? Knowing what was to come-the searing, sharp agony? Death? Or to be ignorant of it, as Della Exington had been? \"I\u0027m not certain whether to be offended or pleased that you began the festivities without me.\" The familiar, pompous voice carried across the chamber. Mina! A soft little pop of warmth spread through my chest . . . then drat! She was here. She was going to ruin everything! \"Well, well, my sweet. So you\u0027ve graced us with your presence after all,\" said the Ankh. I shifted in my restricted position to see Mina standing in the doorway. She was holding a cloth-wrapped parcel, and . . . Bloody hell. She\u0027d got herself captured. And the diadem too. Hathor\u0027s counterpart prodded my partner into the chamber with a complicated looking weapon. Whatever it was-gun, Steam-Streamer-it looked lethal. I met Miss Holmes\u0027s gaze. Either she was too stubborn or too distracted to see the message I sent: Get out of here! \"Please come in, Miss Holmes. I\u0027m delighted that you\u0027ve arrived in time to see your friend share her life force with my beloved Sekhmet. We were just about to begin. Osiris?\" The attendant followed the implicit command by taking the parcel from Miss Holmes and ushering her into the chamber. \"I\u0027m sorry I didn\u0027t follow your directions,\" my partner said. \"I wasn\u0027t fond of the idea of being taken by surprise or otherwise abducted while on my way to Fannery\u0027s Square, which was, I\u0027m certain, your original intent.\" \"Pish,\" said the Ankh. He sounded delighted. \"But you are here, and it truly doesn\u0027t matter how that happened. You won\u0027t be leaving anytime soon, and Osiris would have made certain you came alone.\" At that moment, I heard a soft sound to the right behind me. As if something was sliding across the floor. Miss Holmes had a sudden coughing attack, meeting my eyes over her hand. I turned to look in that direction, on the other side of Sekhmet, but no one was there. \"Very well, then,\" said the Ankh. \"Where were we? Ah, yes,\" he said, moving to the machine. His hand rested on the lever, which I had positioned so he stood in the perfect place for me to bring the statue down on top of him. I craned my neck, trying to look at Mina, but she was too busy making some odd expression at me. Her eyes bugged out and her mouth was twitching. The last thing I wanted to remember seeing before I died was Mina Holmes, silently lecturing me about the mess she\u0027d gotten herself into. I heard another soft, skimming sound of something going across the floor. I looked over as the Ankh began to lower the lever. I focused, waiting for the right moment . . . waiting for the first sensation of shock. I must act before it paralyzed me. The lever shot down and I propelled myself toward the Ankh.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-clockwork-scarab-stoker-holmes-1/page-15.html","bookId":1674,"book":{"id":1674,"title":"The Clockwork Scarab (Stoker \u0026 Holmes #1)","description":"Storyline: The Clockwork Scarab (Stoker \u0026 Holmes #1) Evaline Stoker and Mina Holmes never meant to get into the family business.
