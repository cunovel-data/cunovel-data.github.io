{"id":18616,"no":36,"title":"CHAPTER XXXVI. THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM.","content":"After great troubles our lives rearrange themselves in new forms, which last only until some later evil arises therefrom to alter them once more, and these latter in their turn are subject to further changes, so that from cradle to tomb our fortunes alter in divers ways every moment of our existence. \\n\\n \\n\\n So the prodigal son had returned after his perilous wanderings in far lands, and his home circle killed the fatted calf and made merry in token of rejoicing. When Una saw how haggard the young man was in appearance and how depressed in mind, she felt deeply grateful to Providence that the chance words of Nestley had led her to write the letter which had induced her lover to return. Now that he was once more by her side she determined that nothing should every part them again, and longed eagerly for the marriage to take place which should give her the right to go through life by his side. Doubtless many people would consider such longing hardly compatible with maiden modesty, but Una was too pure and sensible a woman to look at things in such a false light. She ardently loved Reginald and he returned that love, why then should she, for the sake of conventional appearance, risk her life\u0027s happiness by delay, seeing that everything was now at stake? No! she was determined to get married to Reginald as soon as possible, so that he would not be lured to destruction by evil counsel and wicked companions. It was not that she mistrusted her lover, for she well knew his straightforward, honourable nature, but it was better to leave nothing to chance, as even the strongest of men is not proof against temptation. \\n\\n \\n\\n A week after Reginald arrived they were seated in Dr. Larcher\u0027s study talking over the question of the marriage, and the vicar was inclined to agree with their desire that it should be soon, although he was unwilling they should be blamed for undue haste. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The world, my dear Una, is censorious,\" he said, wisely, \"and as the Squire has only been dead two months it will be as well to wait a little longer.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I suppose so,\" replied Una with a sigh, \"although I do not see it would mean any disrespect to his memory if we got married at once.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No doubt, no doubt--still, medio tutissimus ibis, and I think it will be wiser for you both to put off the marriage for at least three months.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Three months,\" said Reginald, with a groan, \"that\u0027s as bad as three years, but I suppose we must--I will stay at Garsworth in the meantime.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of course, my dear boy, of course,\" answered the vicar, crossing his legs and placing his thumbs and forefingers together, \"you can take up your old life again.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah, never! never again,\" said the young man, shaking his head sadly, \"the old life is dead and done with. I have eaten of the tree of knowledge, and the fruit is bitter.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My dear Reginald,\" said Una, crossing over to him and putting her kind arms round his neck, \"you must not be so despondent--it is not your fault.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The sins of the father are visited on the children,\" he replied gloomily, \"if it had been anything else I would not have minded--but to be what I am--a nobody--entitled to bear no name--it is bitter, very bitter indeed. I\u0027ve no doubt I should be above such petty pride, still I am but mortal, and disgrace is hard to bear.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If it is disgrace I will bear it with you,\" whispered Una, smoothing his hair, \"we will be married and go away for a time; you will soon forget the past when we go abroad.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"With your help I hope to,\" he said, looking affectionately into her clear eyes shining down on him with ineffable love in their azure depths. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think,\" remarked the vicar, touched by the deep sorrow of the young man, \"that taking all things into consideration it would be wiser to do as you wish.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And marry?\" cried Reginald eagerly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And marry,\" assented the vicar, nodding good-naturedly; \"what says Horace? \u0027carpe diem quam minimum credula postero.\u0027 So taking that advice it will be best for you both to be married quietly next week and go abroad for a time:--when you return Reginald will doubtless find his position easier.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I hope so,\" said Blake mournfully, as they arose to go, \"but I\u0027m afraid it\u0027s hopeless--this discovery has killed all the pleasures of life--my youth is dead.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The soul is immortal,\" said Dr. Larcher solemnly, \"and on the ruins of your joyous youth, which you regard as dead, you can raise the structure of a nobler and wiser life--it will be hard, but with Una to help you, not impossible--nil mortalibus arduum est.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And they went away from the presence of the old man--he with resignation in his breast, and she with whispering words of comfort on her lips, infinite pity in her eyes, and enduring affection in her heart. \\n\\n \\n\\n Patience Allerby was delighted when she heard how soon the marriage was to take place, as she dreaded lest through the machinations of Beaumont it should be broken off. Once Reginald was married to Una he would be safe both as regards fortune and position, for nothing Beaumont could reveal concerning the conspiracy would alter the state of affairs and her one aim in life to secure happiness for her son, would thus be accomplished. \\n\\n \\n\\n At present, however, she dreaded every day either to see Beaumont or hear from him, especially after the warning letter she had written, nor was she disappointed, for a week after Reginald\u0027s return she received a letter from her quondam lover informing her that he was coming down in order to have a proper understanding with his son. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The young rascal has more firmness of purpose than I gave him credit for,\" he wrote in a cynical vein, \"and took less eagerly to the dissipations of London than I should have expected. I am afraid he inherits your cold blood and not the hot temperament of his father, otherwise he would hardly have left the only city fit to live in for a dull hole like Garsworth. However, I see plainly he is a clod and lacks the divine zest necessary to enjoy life, so I suppose he has returned in perfect contentment to marry Una Challoner and live the bovine life of a country squire. So be it! I certainly do not mind, but first he must settle with me. I have placed him in a good position and given him a large income, so for these services I must be recompensed, and am coming down to have an interview with him on the subject. If he is wise he will seek to know no more than he does, but if he inherits your obstinate nature and wants to know all, I am afraid he will have to learn the truth. Even then it will not be too late, for I to will hold my tongue as to his real birth, and leave him in full possession of his wealth provided I am well paid for such silence. Now that you understand the situation you had better prepare him to receive me as one who desires to be friendly--if he treats me as an enemy he will find me a bitter one, so he had better be sensible and come to terms. As to my love for Una Challoner, you ought to know by this time I love no one but \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yours truly, \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Basil Beaumont.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n This brutal letter fell like a lump of ice on the heart of the unhappy Patience as she saw the net gradually closing round her. She knew only too well that Beaumont would do what he said unless some arrangement could be made--and then, as Nestley said he loved Una, he would doubtless want to marry her as well as gain an income, and their son would be left miserable. No, she would not have it, this devil would not be permitted to sin any more and ruin lives with impunity as he had hitherto done. She made up her mind to see him before his interview with Reginald, and make one last appeal to his feelings as a father; if he refused to grant her prayers and keep the boy ignorant of his real birth she would reveal all herself and bear the shame sooner than he should tempt Reginald to a sin. When all was told she would implore Una to still marry her son, and then depart to bury herself in solitude, and expiate her sins by years of repentance. \\n\\n \\n\\n Events were still in the future, and she knew not how they would turn out, but of one thing she was determined, that Beaumont should not blight and ruin her son\u0027s life as he had blighted and ruined her own. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1864/53977.html","bookId":826,"book":{"id":826,"title":"The Man with a Secret","description":"简介： It was the high road to the village of Garsworth, wide, deeply rutted, and somewhat grass-grown, with a tall hedge of yellow-blossomed gorse on the one side, and on the other a ragged, broken fence, over which leaned a man absorbed in meditation, his...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1864","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:37 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:37 AM"}}
