THE VIEWS OF A CYNIC.","content":"To rule mankind is all I crave \n \n And at my feet to see them curled, \n \n For if you make the world your slave \n \n You\u0027ll ne\u0027er be slave unto the world. \n \n Evidently Dr. Nestley had become friendly with his quondam enemy, for both gentlemen now seemed to be on the best of terms with one another. Either the doctor had succumbed to the wonderful personal fascinations of Beaumont, or the artist had convinced Nestley that he was wrong in regarding him in a hostile manner. \n \n On recognizing Miss Challoner, the young physician came forward to greet her, while Beaumont remained in the background lost in admiration at the wonderful beauty of her face, which appealed strongly to his artistic nature. \n \n \"I didn\u0027t expect to find you here, Miss Challoner,\" said Nestley eagerly; \"my friend and I heard the singing and came in to listen; by the way, will you permit me to introduce Mr. Beaumont?\" \n \n Una bowed a little coldly, for she remembered what Reginald had said about the artist, but, hearing his name mentioned, Beaumont came forward and was formally presented. In spite of her distrust, Una could not but admire the handsome, tired-looking face she beheld and was still further impressed by the peculiar timbre of his voice when he began to talk. Beaumont certainly possessed in no small degree that wonderful fascination of manner attributed to the ill-fated Stewarts of Scotland which atoned so much for their fickleness, treachery and ingratitude. \n \n \"It is Mr. Blake who is singing, I think,\" observed Basil idly, \"he has a wonderful voice.\" \n \n \"Yes,\" answered Una with a pleased smile. \"I have never heard a finer--not even in Germany.\" \n \n \"Ah! you have been in Germany, Miss Challoner?\" \n \n \"For some years--I stayed at Munich.\" \n \n \"A charming city which affords great opportunities for studying art both in music and painting.\" \n \n \"Did you study either, Miss Challoner?\" asked Nestley, who seemed rather annoyed at the impression Beaumont had made. \n \n \"A little of both,\" she answered. \"I was educated in Munich, but I\u0027m afraid my learning was rather desultory--I sing a little--paint a little--and do both badly.\" \n \n \"That would be impossible,\" said Nestley desirous of paying a compliment, but Una frowned at the remark. \n \n \"Don\u0027t, please,\" she said coldly, \"I dislike insincerity.\" \n \n Nestley reddened a little at the tone of her voice and the obvious rebuke, on seeing which Una held out her hand to him with a charming smile. \n \n \"You must not mind what I say, Dr. Nestley,\" she observed, bending forward, \"I\u0027m afraid I\u0027m dreadfully rude.\" \n \n \"And wonderfully charming,\" thought Beaumont, who, however, kept his opinion to himself, warned by the fate of his friend. \n \n The young doctor, meanwhile, had hastily assured Una that he did not mind her severity, in fact rather liked it, and would doubtless in all sincerity have committed himself again only that Blake commenced to sing \"Come, Marguerite come,\" from Sullivan\u0027s \"Martyr of Antioch,\" and they all listened attentively. \n \n Cecilia played the graceful accompaniment of arpeggi lightly, while above this constant sweep of dissevered chords, rising and falling with the voice, the high, penetrating notes of the singer flowed smoothly onward and, as the organist played softly, the full purity of the voice could be heard with marvellous effect. Owing to want of training, Blake\u0027s voice lacked in a great measure the power to give a perfect rendering to the melody, but the richness and mellowness of his notes were undeniable. \n \n When he had finished Beaumont\u0027s face betrayed the pleasure he felt, and Una, who was watching him closely, asked his opinion. \n \n \"A wonderful voice,\" he said critically, as the three walked up the aisle, \"but of course it requires a great deal of cultivation.\" \n \n \"I think it\u0027s charming,\" interposed Nestley, eager to curry favour with Una by praising one whom she evidently regarded as a brother. \n \n \"Of course you would think so,\" replied Beaumont a little contemptuously, \"because you know nothing about the subject; to an uncultivated ear Blake\u0027s voice sounds well because he has a wonderfully fine organ, but to a musician there is a crudeness of style, a want of colouring, and a lack of refinement which makes him regret that such a great natural gift is not trained to its full capabilities.\" \n \n \"But you\u0027re not a musician?\" said Nestley, nettled at the superior tone adopted by his friend. \n \n \"No,\" answered Basil complacently, \"but I have heard a great deal, and as most of my life has been passed among musicians I have picked up a general knowledge of the technicality of the art. Shakespeare never committed a murder, yet he wrote Macbeth and Hamlet. Balzac did not fall in love till somewhere about the forties, but, he wrote \u0027Modeste Mignon,\u0027 and \u0027La Lys dans la vallee,\u0027 before that age--one does not need to be an artist to possess the critical faculty.\" \n \n By this time they had arrived at the chancel, and Reginald came forward to meet them, blushing a little with modesty on discovering three listeners instead of one. \n \n \"I must congratulate you on your voice once more,\" said Beaumont looking at him, \"my advice is to go to London at once and study.\" \n \n \"London!\" echoed Blake disbelievingly, \"why not Italy?\" \n \n \"A tradition only,\" replied the artist calmly, \"because Italy is the land of song every singer thinks he or she must study there, but I assure you it\u0027s a mistake--London and Paris have as good teachers as Milan and Rome--I may say better, for everyone goes to the place where the largest income is to be made.\" \n \n \"How cynical,\" said Una playfully. \n \n \"And how true--this is not the golden age, Miss Challoner, but the age of gold--there is a vast difference between Arcady and Philistia, I assure you.\" \n \n \"I think I\u0027ll take your advice,\" observed Blake gaily, \"perhaps I\u0027ve got a fortune in my throat, who knows?\" \n \n \"Who, indeed?\" said the artist gravely, \"they pay nightingales well now-a-days.\" \n \n \"All the better for Mr. Blake,\" said Una lightly, \"but how rude I am, I must introduce you two gentlemen to the organist--Miss Mosser--Dr. Nestley and Mr. Beaumont.\" \n \n Beaumont, not knowing Cecilia was blind, merely bowed, but Nestley took the fragile hand of the girl and grasped it warmly. \n \n \"I enjoyed your playing so much,\" he said heartily, \"where did you learn?\" \n \n On hearing his voice the pale face of the blind girl coloured, and a painfully eager look crossed her features, as if she were trying to see the speaker\u0027s countenance in spite of her infirmity. \n \n \"What a beautiful voice,\" she murmured softly, and Nestley had to repeat his question before she answered: \n \n \"At the school for the blind at Hampstead,\" she said turning towards him, which reply gave Nestley a painful shock as he realized her misfortune. With delicate tact, however, he passed the answer off lightly in a conversational manner. \n \n \"I don\u0027t know much about music myself,\" he said easily, \"it seems such a complicated affair--are you fond of it?\" \n \n \"Very,\" answered the blind girl quickly. \"You see it is the only pleasure I have. When I go out on to the common and feel the fresh wind and smell the perfume of the gorse, I come back here and try and put it all into music. I often thank God for being able to play the organ.\" \n \n It was deeply pathetic to hear her talk in this strain; shut out by her affliction from all the beauties of Nature, she could yet thank God for the one gift which enabled her in some measure to understand and appreciate what she had never beheld. Doctors, as a rule, are not very soft-hearted, but Nestley could hardly help feeling moved at the thrill of sadness which ran through her speech. This she perceived, and with a light laugh, hastened to dispel the illusion she had created. \n \n \"You must not think I am sad,\" she said cheerfully, \"on the contrary, I never was so happy in my life as I am here. I was brought up all my life in London, and when I was appointed organist here, you can have no idea of the pleasure I felt. I have the common and the organ, while everyone is kind to me, so what have I to wish for? Now, Doctor Nestley, I must ask you to go, as I am about to practise. I think Miss Challoner and your friends have gone.\" \n \n They were waiting for the doctor at the lower end of the church, so after saying good-bye to Cecilia, he hurried away into the dusky atmosphere, and as he reached Beaumont, the organ rolled out the opening chords of a mass by Pergolesi. Reginald went outside with Nestley as he wished to speak to him about the Squire, and Una was left standing with Beaumont in the grey old church. They listened in silence to the deep thunder of the bass notes echoing in the high roof, when suddenly in the middle of a crashing chord the sonorous tones died away and a sweet, pure melody thrilled through the silence, which seemed almost oppressive after the tempest of sound. \n \n \"After the fire there came a still small voice,\" quoted Basil dreamily. \"Do you remember how perfectly Mendelssohn has expressed that idea in music?\" \n \n \"Yes, I heard the Elijah at the Albert Hall,\" replied Una in a matter-of-fact way, being a healthy English girl and not moved by the subtle meaning of the sacred music which touched so quickly the highly-strung nerves of this man. \n \n \"The Albert Hall,\" he repeated with a shrug. \"Oh yes, very fine I\u0027ve no doubt, but to my mind it secularizes sacred music to hear it there--one hears a volume of sound--an immense number of voices in chorus and solos by the best artistes; but where is the soul of the work? one only finds that in a church. The Messiah was first heard in England in Westminster Abbey, and it was there, following the example set by the king, that the whole audience arose at the Hallelujah Chorus, but it was not the music alone, grand as it is, that produced this sudden burst of emotion, it was the august fane grey with centuries of tradition, the presence of the mighty dead sleeping around, and to crown all the dramatic grandeur of the chorus. All these together wrought on the feelings of those present and they did homage to the sublimity of the music--such a thing would be impossible in the Albert Hall.\" \n \n \"Don\u0027t you think you\u0027re giving all the praise to the surroundings and nothing to the musician,\" said Una quickly; \"a true composer could impress his ideas on his hearers without any other aid.\" \n \n \"I\u0027ve no doubt he could,\" replied Beaumont carelessly, \"and no doubt plenty of people have felt emotion at Handel\u0027s music in the Albert Hall, but even Handel\u0027s genius would never have created such an effect as I have described anywhere but in a church; of course I haven\u0027t mentioned the memorable shaft of sunlight which deserves praise for its share in the affair.\" \n \n Something in the flippancy of this remark jarred upon Una\u0027s feelings, so she made no reply but walked outside into the cool fresh air, followed by Beaumont. \n \n He accompanied her as far as the lichgate and then raised his hat. \n \n \"I won\u0027t go any further, Miss Challoner,\" he said. \"I\u0027m in a meditative mood and will take a look round this old place. I hope to see you again soon at the Grange.\" \n \n \"The Grange?\" she questioned, looking at him inquiringly. \n \n \"Yes, I\u0027m coming to see the Squire about painting his portrait you know.\" \n \n \"Of course,\" she replied quickly. \"I remember Patience told me.\" \n \n \"Patience,\" he asked in a startled tone, \"did you say Patience?\" \n \n \"Yes, Patience Allerby, the housekeeper,\" said Una gaily. \"How pale you look, just as if you had seen a ghost--I dare say it\u0027s the effect of the church and music; good-bye, at present,\" and she walked quickly away. \n \n He raised his hat mechanically and stood staring at the ground, looking pale and haggard. \n \n \"Patience Allerby,\" he said in a low voice. \"After all these years--Patience Allerby.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1864/53950.html","bookId":826,"book":{"id":826,"title":"The Man with a Secret","description":"简介： It was the high road to the village of Garsworth, wide, deeply rutted, and somewhat grass-grown, with a tall hedge of yellow-blossomed gorse on the one side, and on the other a ragged, broken fence, over which leaned a man absorbed in meditation, his...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1864","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:37 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:37 AM"}}
