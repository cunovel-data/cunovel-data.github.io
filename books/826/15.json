{"id":18595,"no":15,"title":"CHAPTER XV A FANTASTIC THEORIST.","content":"\"He is a man Full of strange thoughts, and fancies whimsical, Who dreams of dreams that make his life a dream. And had he powers supernal at command, Would tumble heaven itself about our ears In his mad searchings for--I wot not what.\" The room which Beaumont had turned into a studio while painting Squire Garsworth\u0027s portrait, overlooked the terrace on to which the French windows opened. It was the drawing-room of the Grange, and was magnificently furnished in the ponderous style of the Georgian period, though now, being but rarely used, an air of desertion and decay seemed to linger about it. The windows, however, being large and curtainless, there was an excellent light to paint by, so Basil established his easel near the centre window, and placed the squire at one further along, in order that the full light should fall on his withered face, showing the multitudinous wrinkles and stern expression that made it a study worthy of Rembrandt. Beaumont often glanced at the attenuated form lying listlessly back in the great arm-chair, and wondered what curious event had changed this man from an idle reveller into an industrious scholar. Above was the painted ceiling of the apartment, whereon gods and goddesses, in faded tints, disported themselves among dingy blue clouds, surrounded by cupids, sea-horses, rising suns and waning moons, while, below, a threadbare carpet covered the polished floor but imperfectly. A huge marble fireplace, cold and black-looking, heavy, cumbersome chairs, solid-looking tables, a quaint old spinet with thin legs and several comfortable-looking sofas, filled up the room. There were also grim-looking faces frowning from the walls, cabinets filled with grotesque china, now worth its weight in gold, bizarre ornaments from India and China, and many other quaint things, which made the apartment look like a curiosity-shop to the refined taste of the artist. But in spite of the old-time magnificence of the place, spiders spun their webs in the corners, grey dust lay thickly around, and a chill, tomb-like feeling pervaded the room. Even the cheerful sunlight could not lift the heavy shadow which seemed to brood over it, and it seemed, in its loneliness, to be a chamber of some enchanted palace, such as we read of in eastern tales. Nor was the proprietor out of place in this decayed realm of former grandeur, for he looked old and weird enough to have been coeval with the pristine splendours of the Grange. The worn face, the sudden gleams of insane fire from the deeply-set eyes, the snowy, sparse hair that fell from under the black skull-cap, and the sombre robe, all seemed to be the semblance of some hoary necromancer rich in malignant spells of magic. Had Randal Garsworth mixed with the world he would have been a different creature. Had he gone abroad among his fellow men and taken an interest in their ideas concerning politics, literature, and music, he would have retained a healthy mind by such generalization of his intellect. But, shutting himself up, as he had done, in a lonely house, and concentrating his mind upon himself, he lapsed into a morbid state which prepared him for the reception of any fantastical idea. While thus lingering in this unhealthy life, he chanced upon the curious doctrine of metempsychosis, and it speedily took possession of his diseased mind, already strongly inclined towards strange searchings. The weirdness of the Pythagorean theory appealed to his love of the whimsical, and he became a monomaniac on the subject. Under the influence of a lonely life, ardent studies of the philosophers who supported the theory of transmigration, and his selfish application of these wild doctrines to his own soul, the monomania under which he laboured deepened into madness. To all appearances he conducted himself in a rational manner, though slightly eccentric, but with his firm belief in metempsychosis, and his preparations for his future incarnation he could hardly be called sane. Yet he conducted all business matters with admirable skill, and in spite of the dilapidated state of the Grange, his farms were well managed, and his tenants found no cause to complain of neglect on the part of their landlord. Like all madmen, he was a profound egotist, and absorbed in his belief of a re-incarnation on this earth, he paid no heed to the claims of relatives or friends, neglecting all social duties in order to devote himself entirely to his favourite delusions. Such was the man who sat before Basil Beaumont, by whose skilful brush and genuine talent the strange face of the recluse was rapidly being transferred to the canvas in the most life-like manner. \"I hope this portrait will please you,\" said Beaumont, breaking the silence which had lasted some minutes, \"it\u0027s the best thing I have ever done.\" \"Is it?\" replied Garsworth, vaguely, his mind being far away, occupied with some abstruse thought. \"Yes, of course. What did you say?\" \"I hope you\u0027ll like the picture,\" repeated Beaumont, slowly. \"Of course I will,\" said the squire, quickly. \"I want to see myself in the future as I am now. Some people look back on their portraits taken in youth, and see a faint semblance of their old age in the unwrinkled faces, but I will see this picture when in a new body which will have no resemblance in its form to the withered shape I now bear.\" \"A strange doctrine.\" \"As you say--a strange doctrine,\" said Garsworth, warming with his subject, \"but a very true one. My body is old and worn out. Physically, I am an irreparable wreck, but my soul is as lusty, fresh and eager as it was in the days of my youth. Why, then, should not my true entity shed this worn-out, fleshly envelope as a snake does its skin, and enter into a new one replete with the vigour of youth?\" \"A difficult question to answer,\" replied Beaumont, calmly, \"very, very difficult. We have no proof that such a thing can happen.\" \"You are a materialist?\" \"Pardon me, no. A materialist, as I understand the word, denies the independent existence of spirit; I do not. I believe our spirits or souls to be immortal: but, as to this re-incarnation theory--it is a dream of Pythagoras.\" \"It was a dream of many before Pythagoras, and has been the dream of many since,\" rejoined Garsworth, coldly. \"The Egyptians, the Hindoos and the Buddhists all accepted the doctrine, although each treated it according to their different religions. In our modern days Lessing believed in it; and if you have read the writings of Kardec you will find that re-incarnation is the very soul of the spiritist belief.\" Beaumont sneered. \"I can\u0027t say I have much faith in the maunderings of spiritualists. Table-turning and spirit-rapping may be very pleasant as an amusement; but as a religion--bah!\" \"You talk like that because you don\u0027t understand the subject. The things you mention are only the outward manifestation of spiritualism. If you read Kardec\u0027s books you would find that the true theory of spiritualism is transmigration. Spirits are incarnated in human bodies in order to work out their own advancement. If they resist temptation while in the flesh, they enter into a higher sphere, in order to advance another step. If they fail to lead a pure life, they again become re-incarnated in the flesh to make another effort; but they never retrograde.\" \"And you believe in this doctrine?\" asked Beaumont, incredulously. \"With certain reservations--yes.\" \"And those reservations?\" \"I need not mention all, but I will tell you one as an example. The spiritists deny that we remember former existences--I believe we do.\" \"Oh! and you think in your next body you will remember your incarnation as Squire Garsworth?\" \"I do.\" \"Do you remember your former existences?\" \"Some of them.\" \"Why not all?\" \"Because some of the lives I then lived were base in the extreme, and not worthy of remembrance, so I forgot them--in the same way as you forget disagreeable things and only have thoughts of agreeable events.\" \"Will you tell me some of your former existences?\" \"It would be hardly worth while,\" replied the squire, irritably, \"as you would only look upon my narration as a fairy-tale. But I can tell you what I was--an Egyptian prince, a Roman soldier, a Spanish Moor, and an English pauper in the reign of Elizabeth.\" Beaumont looked in astonishment at the old man, glibly running off this fantastic list. \"And since the pauper stage?\" he asked, smothering a smile. \"I have been re-incarnated in this present form,\" responded the squire, gravely; \"it is because I experienced poverty in my last existence that I am saving money now.\" \"I don\u0027t understand.\" \"To keep myself during my next incarnation.\" The artist was becoming quite bewildered at hearing this farrago of nonsense uttered in such a serious tone. However the conversation was so extraordinary that he could not forbear humouring the madman. \"A very laudable intention,\" he said, quietly, \"but as you will be someone else in your next incarnation, how are you going to claim Squire Garsworth\u0027s money?\" \"Ah!\" responded the squire, with a cunning smile, \"that is my secret; I have arranged all that in a most admirable way. I can claim my own money without any trouble.\" \"But suppose you are born a savage?\" \"I will not be born a savage--that would be retrogression, and spirits never retrograde.\" \"Well,\" said Beaumont, rising to his feet, and putting his brushes away, \"your conversation is getting too deep for me, Mr. Garsworth. I understand your metempsychosis theory all right, though I don\u0027t agree with it; but I fail to see how you are going to arrange about getting your own money.\" \"No, no!\" replied Garsworth, raising his form, tall and gaunt, against the bright light outside, \"of course not; that is my secret. No one will know--not one! Is your sitting finished?\" \"Yes, for to-day.\" \"Come to-morrow--come to-morrow!\" said the old man, coming round to look at the picture, \"no time to be lost, I may die before it\u0027s done, and then I won\u0027t be able to see myself as I was: but Nestley will keep me alive--good doctor--very good doctor--paid him handsomely--yes, handsomely! Good-bye for to-day, Mr. Beaumont. Don\u0027t forget to-morrow; I may die--no time to lose--good-bye!\" The old man shuffled tremulously out of the room, and Beaumont stood looking after him with a puzzled smile on his lips. He began to put his paraphernalia away slowly and talked softly to himself meanwhile. \"I wonder if there\u0027s any sense in the old fool\u0027s ravings--I don\u0027t believe in this incarnation rubbish--but he\u0027s got some scheme in his head about that money--I\u0027d like to find it out--there might be something in it by which I could benefit--he\u0027s a madman sure enough but still there is method in his madness--however, I\u0027ll try to discover his secret somehow.\" He lighted a cigarette and sauntered out on to the terrace, thinking over the chances of finding out the Squire\u0027s secret with a view to turning it to his own account. Apparently his cogitations led to some result, for after standing for a few minutes at the end of the terrace in a brown study, he removed his cigarette from his mouth and uttered one word: \"Hypnotism.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1864/53956.html","bookId":826,"book":{"id":826,"title":"The Man with a Secret","description":"简介： It was the high road to the village of Garsworth, wide, deeply rutted, and somewhat grass-grown, with a tall hedge of yellow-blossomed gorse on the one side, and on the other a ragged, broken fence, over which leaned a man absorbed in meditation, his...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1864","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:37 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:37 AM"}}
