{"id":18606,"no":26,"title":"CHAPTER XXVI. UNA MAKES A CONFESSION.","content":"He may be poor, and quite unknown, \n \n In rank there may be men above him; \n \n But my heart beats for him alone, \n \n You ask the reason; this--I love him! \n \n The next morning Beaumont examined the important document, upon which hung the fate of his scheme, in order to see by the searching light of day if a close scrutiny would reveal in any palpable degree his alterations. According to his expectations, it appeared eminently satisfactory, for the words he had inserted had turned quite black, and assumed the ebon tint of the rest of the handwriting, so to an ordinary observer the entire document appeared to have been written by one person. True, if it were submitted to experts in a court of law, the forgery might be detected; but Beaumont was quite satisfied in his own mind that the paper would never have to stand such a test. The directions in the will, the production of the paper and seal-ring mentioned therein, and the evidence of Patience Allerby as to the birth of Reginald, would be quite strong enough evidence to put him in possession of the property, even if Una should contest the affair, which he knew she would not do when she found that the heir who ousted her from her rightful position was Reginald Blake. \n \n Being therefore perfectly satisfied, Mr. Beaumont took the envelope, directed by the Squire to Reginald Blake, at the Vicarage, and having placed some new wax on the closing fold, he stamped it with the Garsworth arms by means of the seal ring. Then placing the document he had so carefully prepared inside, together with the ring, he melted the under portion of the wax till it became soft and firmly closed the letter so that no one, from its appearance, could detect the fraud. \n \n This being done, he placed the important letter, together with the keys given to him by Nestley, in his breast coat pocket, and set off gaily to the Grange, in order to place it where it could be easily found. \n \n He had invented some trivial explanation to give to Una and Miss Cassy should he meet them before carrying out his plan, and, of course, on having done so, the mission of delivering the keys to Una would be ample excuse for his intrusion on their grief. Fate, however, stood his friend, for by going round to a side door he was enabled to enter the house, and go to the housekeeper\u0027s room, unseen by anyone, save Jellicks, who admitted him. \n \n Patience, looking pale and worn, arose to receive him, and he half dreaded to glance at her lest she had altered her mind. Her first remark, however, reassured him at once. \n \n \"Have you arranged everything?\" she asked eagerly. \n \n \"Yes! Here is the precious document,\" he replied, producing the envelope, \"and here are the keys of the Squire\u0027s desk.\" \n \n \"Where did you get them?\" \n \n \"From Nestley; he gave them to me to return to Miss Challoner, as I intend to do after placing this letter in the Squire\u0027s desk. There\u0027s no time to be lost, Patience--take me up to the room at once.\" \n \n \"Wait a moment,\" she replied cautiously, growing a shade paler. \"I\u0027d better go and see that Miss Cassy and Miss Una are safe in the oak parlour first. Wait here.\" \n \n She glided out of the room like a ghost, and after an absence of ten minutes returned to Beaumont with a more composed expression on her face. \n \n \"They are at breakfast,\" she said in a whisper, \"no chance of being disturbed by them. Come along, but make no noise. Every sound echoes through this old place.\" \n \n Silently and stealthily they stole along the dark passages, which, owing to the light filtering through grimy windows, had a dusky appearance. Softly over the echoing pavement of the gloomy hall, up the wide staircase with the old Garsworths frowning on them from the walls, as if they knew their wicked errand, along the chill length of the upper corridor, and then the slow turning of the key in the lock, the gentle opening of the door, and they stood in the presence of the dead. \n \n So still, so lonely, so cold, with the heavy curtains drawn over the wide windows, only admitting faint streaks of light which stole whitely through the heavy atmosphere of the room. On the bed was the black coffin, with the dead man laid therein. On either side tall candles were burning with a sickly light, and the heavy draperies of the bed hung motionless as if frozen with horror. In the dim shadows of the far end of the room, where the faint daylight and the faint candlelight produced an unnatural twilight, stood the desk, and towards it Beaumont stepped with a stealthy activity, suggestive of the sinuosity of a tiger. After him, soft-footed and pale, stole the woman up. \n \n \"In which recess did you lock up the letter?\" he asked in a low whisper. \n \n She indicated the place with outstretched finger and shuddered as she heard the click of the key turning in the lock. A subdued rustle of papers, a soft, shutting sound, another click as the key turned again, and the first part of the scheme was achieved. \n \n In the shadowy light of the room their faces looked pale and haggard, as they sped silently and rapidly towards the door, as though they feared lest the dead man should arise from his coffin and call upon them to stop. Did no frown pass over that marble face? Did no sound hint to them that a disembodied spirit stood near the bed wailing over the failure of its cherished scheme through the treachery of humanity? No, all was still as the grave as the two companions glided out of the room, along the corridor, down the stairs, and found themselves once more in the housekeeper\u0027s room. \n \n \"Faugh!\" said Beaumont, on whose pale face the beads of perspiration were standing, \"what unpleasant work. Give me some brandy.\" \n \n The housekeeper silently left the room and shortly returned with a liqueur glass of the liquor, which he tossed off rapidly, and the effect was soon seen in the glow which came over his face. \n \n \"You ought to have some yourself,\" he suggested, handing her back the glass. \n \n \"I don\u0027t require it,\" she replied coldly. \"I\u0027m used to the atmosphere of this house. You are not.\" \n \n \"It\u0027s like a charnel-house,\" he said, with a look of disgust. \"Well, I\u0027ve done my part of the affair. Now, all you\u0027ve got to do is to swear Reginald is Fanny Blake\u0027s son. I\u0027ll leave it to your ingenuity to tell a good story.\" \n \n \"You can be certain of that,\" she replied coldly. \"I\u0027ve done with all scruples, and since it is to enrich my son, you may be sure I will do my best. And now I suppose in order to avert all suspicion, you\u0027d better see Miss Una.\" \n \n \"Yes, of course. I want to return her these keys,\" he replied, jingling the bunch. \"If any questions are asked, of course you can swear I have not been out of the room. But I don\u0027t think you need be afraid, everything will go quite smooth. There is a strong motive.\" \n \n \"And the motive?\" \n \n \"Una\u0027s love for Reginald. Now go and tell her I am here.\" \n \n When Patience left the room on her errand he dusted his boots with his handkerchief, pulled down his shirt-cuffs and settled his tie and hair in the mirror over the fireplace. By the time Patience returned he had quite recovered his nonchalant manner, and was humming a tune when she entered. \n \n \"Well?\" he asked, facing round. \n \n \"It\u0027s all right. She will see you,\" replied the housekeeper, and, catching up his hat and stick, Beaumont followed her along the passage to the oak parlour. \n \n Una and Miss Cassy, both in deep mourning, were seated at the breakfast-table when he entered, and as the door closed on Patience, he apologised for disturbing them. \n \n \"Of course I would not have thought of intruding on your grief,\" he said, in a courtly manner, \"but the fact is, Miss Challoner, I have a message for you from Doctor Nestley.\" \n \n \"Ah, poor, dear doctor,\" whimpered Miss Cassy, dabbing her red eye-lids with a pocket handkerchief. \"He\u0027s gone away--so very odd.\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t think so, aunt,\" observed Una quietly. \"He had done all he could for my poor cousin, and now it would be merely wasting his time for him to remain. What is the message, Mr. Beaumont?\" \n \n \"Just to give you these keys,\" he said, handing the bunch to her. \"They belonged to the squire, and Nestley picked them up after the death, intending to give them to you, only he forgot all about them till it was too late, so asked me to bring them to you.\" \n \n Una took the keys with a grave bow. \n \n \"Thank you very much, Mr. Beaumont,\" she said, putting them in her pocket. \"It was very kind of you to bring them. I trust Doctor Nestley is well?\" \n \n Beaumont shrugged his shoulders, the meaning of which action she understood with feminine quickness. \n \n \"Let us hope he will be quite well when he returns home,\" she said with emphasis, her colour rising. \"I am truly sorry for him. Where did he contract this unfortunate habit?\" \n \n \"Oh, in London, I believe,\" said Beaumont carelessly. \"I knew him there five or six years ago. He was very fast in those days. Then he pulled up and reformed altogether. I am sorry to see him resuming his old habits.\" \n \n Mr. Beaumont did not think it necessary to explain how he had tempted the unhappy young man, so poor Nestley was blamed severely by both ladies for his evident tendency to fast living. \n \n \"So dreadful,\" piped Miss Cassy, lifting up her hands. \"I really cannot understand it, and the dear doctor was so nice. Really, it\u0027s very odd. Oh, are you going, Mr. Beaumont? So sorry--good-bye.\" \n \n Beaumont bowed to both the ladies and then left the room, quite satisfied with his interview. \n \n \"I think I have fixed up everything satisfactorily,\" he muttered to himself, as he lighted a cigarette outside on the terrace. \"If Patience only carries out her part of the affair as well as I have done mine, we\u0027ll soon put Reginald in possession of the property, and then--it\u0027s my turn.\" \n \n Miss Cassy watched him cross the terrace, and turned to Una with a look of admiration in her eyes. \n \n \"What a handsome man Mr. Beaumont is--so distinguished?\" she said volubly. \"Quite like a Spanish what\u0027s-his-name, you know.\" \n \n \"He\u0027s not bad-looking,\" replied Una absently, \"but I prefer Reginald.\" \n \n \"Mr. Blake?\" said Miss Cassy, rather astonished to hear her niece speak of him in such a familiar way. \n \n Una saw that she had betrayed herself, so, going over to the elder lady, put her arms round her waist caressingly. \n \n \"Auntie, you must have seen it all the time.\" \n \n \"Seen what?\" asked Miss Cassy, opening her eyes widely. \n \n \"That I love Reginald.\" \n \n \"Love Reginald Blake! Oh, my dear--how very odd.\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t see it\u0027s odd at all,\" replied Una blushing, \"we love one another very dearly.\" \n \n \"But, my dear, he\u0027s nobody.\" \n \n \"He\u0027s everybody--in my eyes,\" said Una fondly. \n \n \"What would the Squire have said?\" observed Miss Cassy in dismay. \n \n \"Forbidden the marriage, I\u0027ve no doubt,\" replied Una, \"so that is why we kept our engagement quiet--but now we are free to marry.\" \n \n \"Oh, Una, how heartless you are--so odd, and the poor Squire just dead.\" \n \n \"My dear auntie,\" said Una gravely, \"I am the last person in the world to speak ill of the dead, but I cannot feign a regret which I do not feel; the Squire asked us down here for his own gratification--not ours; we have lived on our own money, and not his; he has taken no notice of us at all--so neither you nor I can pretend to weep over the death of a man whom we hardly ever saw, and who certainly did nothing to deserve tears.\" \n \n \"But still, he may have left you his fortune,\" urged Miss Cassy in a tearful voice. \n \n \"I doubt it,\" replied Una with a sigh, \"but fortune or no fortune, I cannot pretend to a grief I do not feel.\" \n \n \"And you are quite determined to marry Reginald Blake?\" \n \n \"Quite--we love each other devotedly.\" \n \n \"I\u0027m sure I hope so,\" said poor Miss Cassy whimpering, \"it\u0027s just like a romance of what\u0027s-his-name--so very odd; he is good-looking, I know--but money--he\u0027s got no money.\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t want money--I want him.\" \n \n \"He\u0027s got no name.\" \n \n \"He\u0027ll make one with his voice.\" \n \n \"I\u0027m sure,\" cried Miss Cassy in despair, \"I can\u0027t see what you see in him.\" \n \n Una closed the argument in a most decisive manner. \n \n \"I love him.\" \n \n This remark was unanswerable, so Miss Cassy dissolved in tears. \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1864/53967.html","bookId":826,"book":{"id":826,"title":"The Man with a Secret","description":"简介： It was the high road to the village of Garsworth, wide, deeply rutted, and somewhat grass-grown, with a tall hedge of yellow-blossomed gorse on the one side, and on the other a ragged, broken fence, over which leaned a man absorbed in meditation, his...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1864","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:37 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:37 AM"}}
