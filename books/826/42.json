{"id":18622,"no":42,"title":"CHAPTER XLII. THE DAWN OF A NEW LIFE.","content":"On mount and mere the moonlight lies \n Dim shadows veil the western skies, \n On every stream the starlight gleams, \n And all is mystery and dreams. \n But now Night folds her sombre wings. \n The lark his morning carol sings, \n A rosy, light glows o\u0027er the lawn, \n And lo! in splendour breaks the dawn. \n \n It was about a year since the marriage of Una with Reginald, and they were standing on the terrace of their hotel at Salerno, which overlooked the sea. Far below lay the blue ocean with its fringe of white waves breaking on a shore that extended in a curve round the base of the lofty mountains, the summits of which were clearly defined against the opaline sky. And what a wonderful sky it was, for the setting sun had irradiated the pure ether with most gorgeous colours. Great golden clouds in the west, forming a canopy over the intolerable brilliance of the sinking sun, melted into a delicate rose colour, which, rising towards the zenith, imperceptibly dissolved into a cold, clear blue, out of which peered a few stars. There were some boats on the sea with their broad sails, and the young couple on the terrace could hear every now and then the shrill voice of a minstrel singing a popular Italian air to the sharp notes of the mandolin. \n \n It was a wonderfully picturesque scene, and one which would have enchanted the eye of an artist, but Mr. and Mrs. Garsworth, leaning over the terrace, were not looking at the splendours of sea and sky, being engaged one in reading and the other in listening to a letter which appeared to interest them deeply. \n \n They had been wandering about the Continent in a desultory kind of fashion for many months, exploring all kinds of old-fashioned cities, with their treasures of bygone ages. They had gazed at the splendours of the Alhambra at Granada, enjoyed the brilliant glitter of Parisian life, wandered in quiet Swiss valleys under the white crest of Mont Blanc, seen the Wagner Festival at Bayreuth, and dreamed of medi?val ages in the narrow streets of Nuremberg and Frankfort. Then coming south they had beheld with delighted eyes the white miracle of Milan Cathedral, passed enchanted moonlit hours in the palace-sided canals of Venice, idled amid the awesome ruins of the Eternal City, and after seeing the smoking crest of Vesuvius rise over the marvellous bay of Naples, had come to pass a few days at Salerno, that wonderfully picturesque town, which recalls to the student of Longfellow memories of Elsa and her princely lover. \n \n Reginald was perfectly happy. He had, it is true, lost all the gay carelessness of youth, but in its place he had found the deeper joy which arises out of a great sorrow. There never was a more devoted wife than Una, nor a more attached husband than Reginald, and the bitter sorrow which had shown them both how truly they loved one another had borne good fruit, for they had learnt to trust, love, and honour each other so implicitly that no shadow ever arose between them to darken their married life. At Salerno, however, they had found a letter from Miss Cassy, who had been left in charge of Garsworth Grange, giving all the news and urging them to return home again. Nor was the request unwelcome, for, now that his heart wound was to a certain extent cured, Reginald began to tire of the glowing landscapes of southern Europe, and to long for that cold northern land so fresh and green under its mists and rain. \n \n Una was reading the letter and Reginald, leaning his arms on the balustrade of the balcony, gazed idly at the fantastic splendours of the scene before him, listening eagerly to the news which brought so vividly before him the long marshes, the dreary Grange, and the quiet village life of Garsworth. \n \n \"I do wish you would come back, Una,\" wrote Miss Cassy, who, by the way, wrote exactly as she spoke, \"it seems so odd the long time you\u0027ve been away. According to your instructions the Grange has been done up beautiful, and I\u0027m sure you will see how my taste has improved it. It\u0027s not a bit dreary now, but bright and homelike, and I\u0027m sure you and dear Reginald will love it when you see it again. I do so long to hear about your travels--Rome and Santa Lucia, you know--it\u0027s a song, isn\u0027t it----?\" \n \n Curiously enough, as Una was reading this the unseen minstrel below broke into the well-known air with its charming refrain. Reginald and Una looked at one another and laughed. \n \n \"What a wonderful coincidence,\" said Reginald, peering over the balcony to see the musician; \"if we told that to Miss Cassy she wouldn\u0027t believe it; but never mind, go on with the letter.\" \n \n \"I got a letter from Dr. Nestley, the other day,\" read Una. \"Of course, you know he married Cecilia Mosser, and went home to his own place, at some town in the North--I forget its name. He is quite reformed now, and makes an excellent husband. I hear he is making a good deal of money, and Cecilia is organist at a church up there. You remember how beautifully she played?\" \n \n \"I\u0027m glad they are happy,\" interrupted Reginald, heartily. \"Poor Nestley\u0027s life was nearly ruined by that scampish father of mine.\" \n \n \"I see Aunty says something about him,\" said Una, quickly. \"She writes: \u0027In the letter I received from Dr. Nestley, he says he heard that Mr. Beaumont--you remember, Una?--who stayed at Garsworth--a charming man--is in America, and has married a very rich lady.\u0027\" \n \n \"I wish her joy of the bargain,\" said Reginald, grimly. \"I suppose he has quite forgotten my poor mother.\" \n \n \"Never mind, dear,\" answered Una. \"I\u0027m sure your mother is much happier now.\" \n \n \"As a Sister of Mercy,\" said Reginald, in a musing tone, \"poking about among the slums of London. It\u0027s a curious life for her to take up.\" \n \n \"I think she always had a leaning that way,\" replied Una, with a sigh; \"and it will make her forget the past.\" \n \n \"I wish she would accept some money, to make her comfortable.\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t think she will,\" said Mrs. Garsworth, folding up the letter; \"but when we go back again, perhaps she\u0027ll give up London, and come back to Garsworth.\" \n \n \"I\u0027m afraid not,\" replied Reginald, gravely. \"My mother is a woman of strong will, and she thinks she has a sin to expiate, so she\u0027ll stay and labour there till she dies. Well, what else does Miss Cassy say?\" \n \n \"Nothing particular,\" answered Una, putting the letter in her pocket. \"Mrs. Larcher still labours under \u0027The Affliction.\u0027 Dr. Larcher has been to London, to attend some arch?ological meeting. Dick Pemberton has come in for his money and, Aunty thinks, has some idea of asking Pumpkin to be his wife.\" \n \n \"Pumpkin?\" echoed Reginald, in a shocked tone. \"No, Una, you forget--Eleanora Gwendoline.\" \n \n They both laughed, and Una went on giving the news. \n \n \"Jellicks and Munks are both well, and Ferdinand Priggs is going to bring out a new volume of poems.\" \n \n \"Is he, really?\" said Reginald, lightly. \"Don\u0027t I pity the unhappy public! But all this news makes me home-sick, Una.\" \n \n \"I feel exactly the same,\" she replied, rising to her feet, and slipping her arm into that of her husband. \"Let us go home again.\u0027 \n \n \"Yes, I think we will,\" said Reginald, after a pause, \"I don\u0027t mind living at Garsworth, now you are with me, Una.\" \n \n \"And what about your voice?\" she said, playfully. \"Your wonderful voice, that was going to make your fortune?\" \n \n \"Ah, that is a dream of the past,\" he said, half sadly. \"I will settle down into a regular country squire, Una, and the only use I\u0027ll make of my voice will be to sing Lady Bell to you.\" \n \n Then, putting his arm round her, he sang the last verse of the quaint old ballad: \n \n \"My Lady Bell, in gold brocade, \n Looked not so fair and sweet a maid, \n As when, in linsey woollen gown, \n She left for love the noisy town.\" \n \n His voice sounded rich and full in the mellow twilight, while the minstrel below stopped playing, as he heard the song floating through the shadowy air. The sun had sunk into the sea, and the stars were shining brilliantly. One long bar of vivid light stretched along the verge of the horizon, and the air was full of shadows and the perfume of unseen flowers. \n \n \"See!\" said Reginald, pointing towards the band of light, \"it is like the dawn.\" \n \n \"Yes!--the dawn of a new life for you and for me, dear,\" she whispered; and then they wandered along the terrace, through the shadows, with the hoarse murmur of the distant sea in their ears, but in their hearts the new-born feelings of joy and contentment. \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1864/53983.html","bookId":826,"book":{"id":826,"title":"The Man with a Secret","description":"简介： It was the high road to the village of Garsworth, wide, deeply rutted, and somewhat grass-grown, with a tall hedge of yellow-blossomed gorse on the one side, and on the other a ragged, broken fence, over which leaned a man absorbed in meditation, his...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1864","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:37 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:37 AM"}}
