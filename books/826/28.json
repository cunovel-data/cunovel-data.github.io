{"id":18608,"no":28,"title":"CHAPTER XXVIII. THE BITTERNESS OF DEATH.","content":"We call Death cruel, but death ends all strife, \\n\\n Dishonour turns to gall the sweetest life. \\n\\n \\n\\n To say that those who had assembled in the drawing-room of the Grange to hear the will read were astonished at the extraordinary disclosures they had heard, would give but a faint idea of the amazement they felt. That the squire should have left his large fortune to a son of whom no one had ever heard was most remarkable, but that the son in question should turn out to be Reginald Blake was almost beyond belief. \\n\\n \\n\\n Still, after examining all the evidences of the fact, Mr. Bolby came to the conclusion that there could be no doubt as to the identity of the young man. \\n\\n \\n\\n According to the story told by Patience Allerby, who was well known to be the nurse of the boy, he had been born at Chelsea, London, six months after Fanny Blake\u0027s arrival there, and had been called by his mother\u0027s name. On bringing him down to the village, Randal Garsworth, no doubt dreading the scandal, refused to recognise his son, but agreed to pay for his keep. Patience, therefore, had done the best she could under the circumstances, and had placed the boy with Dr. Larcher, telling him that his parents were dead, thus giving him at least the fiction of an honourable birth. It had been a lie, no doubt, still it was a lie the nobility of which there was no denying, and one which would hardly be set down by the Recording Angel. \\n\\n \\n\\n As to the strange discovery that had been made, everyone saw at once that the squire had tried to make tardy reparation for his sin by leaving his property to his unfortunate son; and the evidence of the will itself, the evidence of the letter found in the squire\u0027s desk, and the evidence of the seal ring, all showed plainly that the young man was really and truly the mysterious son alluded to in the will. Besides, according to Dr. Larcher, the squire had mentioned Reginald\u0027s name on his death-bed, and pointed towards the desk, intimating, no doubt, that the document which would give the young man his just right was hidden there, as indeed it was. Altogether, on reviewing the whole case through, Mr. Bolby declared it to be the most extraordinary one that had ever come under his notice. There could be no doubt but that justice had been done, and Reginald was formally recognised by everyone as the master of Garsworth Grange. \\n\\n \\n\\n Of course, the absence of registration and baptismal certificates would doubtless have proved a stumbling-block in a court of law, but, as Beaumont had foreseen, there was no hesitation upon Una\u0027s part to surrender the property to one whom she believed to be the rightful heir, and moreover, when Mr. Bolby discovered that the two claimants were engaged to be married, he declared that it was a very neat solution of the difficulty, although, as a matter of fact, owing to the clearness of the case on the one side and the refusal to test its truth by legal process on the other, no such difficulty had ever arisen. \\n\\n \\n\\n Beaumont was now extremely satisfied with the way in which his conspiracy had succeeded, as he had placed his son in possession of a fine estate, worth ten thousand a year. Now his next object was to gain control of this large income through the young man himself. Thanks to his ingratiating manner, he completely succeeded in fascinating Reginald, who admired him greatly, and Beaumont only wanted to have the young man in his company for a few months to become indispensable to him. He proposed to become Reginald\u0027s right-hand man, at a fixed salary, and with authority to look after the estate, out of which he foresaw he could make some nice pickings. To do this, however, he would have to get Reginald away from the village, as Patience jealously watched her son, and if she thought for one moment that Beaumont was trying to take advantage of his lack of worldly experience, was quite capable of exposing the whole swindle. \\n\\n \\n\\n Fate, however, once more played into his hands, for Mr. Bolby, having recognised Reginald as the heir, insisted upon his coming up to London to see his partner, and be put in formal possession of the estate. Beaumont therefore determined also to go to London first, so as not to arouse the suspicious nature of Patience Allerby, and then call on Reginald when he arrived later on. Once he had an interview with him in London he was quite satisfied that he could do what he liked with the plastic nature of the young man. \\n\\n \\n\\n On his part Blake, or, as he was now called, Garsworth, was anxious to leave the village for a time till the nine days\u0027 wonder was over, for in spite of the consolatory feeling of having ten thousand a year, he felt his position bitterly. Having been brought up in an English gentleman\u0027s household, he had imbibed rigorous principles all his life, therefore it seemed to him a terrible disgrace to have such a stigma on his name. He was a nobody--a nameless outcast, unrecognized by the law of England--and much as he wanted to marry Una, he shrank from giving her a name to which he had no legal claim. He dreaded lest there should be children of such a marriage, in which case they would have to bear the stigma attached to their father\u0027s birth, and he spoke seriously to Dr. Larcher about releasing Una from her engagement and restoring to her the property to which he felt she was justly entitled. Thus were the fruits of Beaumont\u0027s crime placed in jeopardy by the honour and upright feeling of the young man whom such crime had benefited, but luckily for Mr. Beaumont, Una came to the rescue. \\n\\n \\n\\n She plainly told Reginald that she did not care for the circumstances of his birth, which he could not help in any way, and as to her being rightfully entitled to the property, if she married him the property would be just as much hers as if it had been duly left to her by the squire. So after a great deal of persuasion from Una and Dr. Larcher, Reginald came to accept his somewhat improved position with equanimity. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I cannot stay here, however,\" he said bitterly. \"Everyone stares at me as if I were a wild beast. I will go up to town with Mr. Bolby, and return in a few months, when I get more used to the position.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Una fully approved of this, and agreed to stay on at the Grange with Miss Cassy until he returned, then they would be married, and go abroad for a year, during which time the old house would be redecorated, and they would then return to live in it, when all the circumstances of his succession to the property had to some extent been forgotten. \\n\\n \\n\\n Beaumont, having heard this decision, determined to go up to Town in advance and there await Reginald\u0027s arrival. So, after taking an effusive farewell of everyone, he departed, carrying with him the good wishes of all with whom he had come in contact. Only Patience did not wish him God speed, but surveyed him grimly when he came to say good-bye to her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m glad to see you go,\" she said coldly. \"Our son is now provided for, and you have at least done something towards repairing your villainy. I hope I\u0027ll never set eyes upon you again, but if ever I hear of you meddling with Reginald in any way it will be the worse for you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Say the worse for both of us,\" retorted Beaumont airily. \"We\u0027re in the same box over this affair, and punishment to me means the same for you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n So he took his departure, leaving an excellent impression behind him, and everyone hoped he would come back again some day, which he laughingly promised to do if his engagements would permit him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll see you in London, Reginald,\" he said to the young man, \"and anything I can do for you there, of course, you may command me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Reginald thanked him for his kindness, little thinking how treacherous that kindness was, and then addressed himself to the work of preparing for his own departure. \\n\\n \\n\\n He had a long interview with Patience, in which she informed him that the story told by her to Dr. Larcher had been told with the best intentions to spare him the truth, and on consideration he saw for himself that she had acted for the best, so he forgave her for the falsehood. Patience stayed on at the Grange, living her old life, and felt quite satisfied now that the future of the human being she loved best on earth was secured. \\n\\n \\n\\n Reginald asked Dr. Larcher to let him take Dick to Town, which request the worthy vicar granted, only admonishing Mr. Bolby to look carefully after the pair. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I love them as my own sons,\" said the good man gravely, \"and I dread lest they should be led into evil ways in the great city--they are young and untried--let them not drink, for what says Horace? \u0027Non ego sanius, Bacchabor Edonis.\u0027\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They won\u0027t get any bad example from me,\" said Mr. Bolby, \"from me there\u0027s no bad example to be got. I\u0027ll take them to the theatres and several amusements, but that\u0027s all.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n So the vicar, full of anxiety for his dear boys, allowed them to go, and the last to bid Reginald farewell was Una. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t forget me among all the beauties of London,\" she whispered archly; \"or I\u0027ll come to Town to look for you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be afraid,\" he replied with an affectation of lightness he was far from feeling. \"I will come back to you heart-whole, and then if you\u0027ll have me we\u0027ll be married.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n So the poor lad departed, having learned already thus early in life that wealth alone does not bring happiness. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1864/53969.html","bookId":826,"book":{"id":826,"title":"The Man with a Secret","description":"简介： It was the high road to the village of Garsworth, wide, deeply rutted, and somewhat grass-grown, with a tall hedge of yellow-blossomed gorse on the one side, and on the other a ragged, broken fence, over which leaned a man absorbed in meditation, his...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1864","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:37 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:37 AM"}}
