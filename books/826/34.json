{"id":18614,"no":34,"title":"CHAPTER XXXIV. A WORD IN SEASON.","content":"I weary of dances, of songs of the south \n \n Of sounds of the viol and lute, \n \n Ah, bitter to find that all things in my mouth \n \n Taste only of bitter sea fruit. \n \n It was now two months since Reginald had come to London, and he was beginning to get very wearied of the exhausting life he was leading. He half determined to leave Town and return home again, but was still undecided, when he received a letter from Una which confirmed his resolution. \n \n Outside the fog was thick and yellow, enveloping the shivering houses in a solid dingy mist, which made everything look ineffably dreary. Along the streets and in the houses gas was burning with an unwilling look, as if it knew it had no right to be lighted during the day. Day!--good heavens, was this semi-twilight the day, with the heavy fog lowering down on the streets, through which the cabs and busses crept along in a cautious and stealthy manner? Was that dull red ball, which appeared to give neither light nor heat, the glorious sun? And the atmosphere; a chilling clammy air, which insinuated itself everywhere, making the flesh creep as though at the touch of a repulsive serpent. Assuredly this siren London, who was so enticing at night, under the glare of countless lamps, was not a pleasant spectacle in the morning, and the smiling rose-wreathed Circe of the evening was changed to a haggard unkempt hag with worn face and dreary eyes. \n \n Reginald was seated at the breakfast table, but the food before him was untouched, as he now felt no appetite, but sat listlessly back in his chair, reading Una\u0027s letter, which had just arrived. She was anxious for him to return to Garsworth, and it was this portion of the letter which touched Blake with a certain amount of remorse. \n \n \"You can have no idea how I miss you, Reginald, and every day you are absent seems to part us further from one another. The business which took you up to London must surely be completed by this time, so if you love me, as I know you do, come back at once to Garsworth, and we will be married as soon as is compatible with decorum after the death of your father. Then we can travel on the Continent for a time, and I being by your side will no longer feel this terrible anxiety for your welfare which now constantly haunts me. Although I know your own instincts will always lead you to do what is right and just, both towards yourself and your friends, yet I dread the influence of that dangerous London, against whose temptations even the strongest nature cannot prevail. This is the first request I have ever made to you, dear Reginald, and I feel sure you will grant it. So come back at once to me, and remember I shall count every moment of time until I see you once more by my side.\" \n \n When he came to this part of the letter, Reginald laid it aside and began to think over the words Una had written. \n \n Yes!--she was quite right--it was better for him in every way to go back to Garsworth, and leave this feverish, unreal existence which he was now leading. He would return once more to the old familiar life, with its gentle simplicity and pleasant delights--the rising in the early grey of the morning, the matutinal run with the dogs across the breezy common--then, later on in the day, he would meet Una, and stroll with her through the quiet village streets, where everyone knew and loved them both, from the ancient grandmother basking in the sunshine to the prattling child tottering after them for notice with unsteady gait. No fog--no dreary rattle of cabs--no hoarse cries of news-boy and fish-vendor--but the bright beautiful, blue sky, with the golden sun shining, and a moist keen wind blowing from the distant fen-lands, filled with strange cold odours stolen from hidden herbs. And in the evening he would sing to her--sing those charming old ballads of Phyllis and Daphne, and Lady Bell--which he had not sung for so many days--or perhaps they would listen to the ponderous conversation of Dr. Larcher, with its classical flavouring of Horace. \n \n The time would pass by in such innocent pleasures upon rapid wings, until their wedding-day came, with the budding leaves in tree and hedge, and the timid out-peeping of delicate spring flowers. Then the genial old vicar would make them man and wife, in the sacred gloom of the familiar church, while the wedding march pealed forth from the organ, and the joy-bells clashed in the ancient Norman tower. Afterwards they would go abroad for some months, and wander through old-world cities, among the treasures of dead ages--returning when they were weary, to lead quiet and useful lives under their own roof-tree, and among the friends of their early days. Yes!--he would go back to Garsworth, and try to realize these delightful dreams, but--Beaumont---- \n \n At this moment--as if in answer to his thoughts--a knock came to the door, and Beaumont entered--scattering at once the cloud-built castles in which Reginald\u0027s dreamy fancy had been indulging. His quick eye at once saw that the young man had eaten no breakfast--and he laughed gaily as he removed his hat and sat down near the fire. \n \n \"Don\u0027t feel well this morning?\" he said lightly. \"What a humbug you are, Blake--a little dissipation should be nothing for a healthy young country fellow like you.\" \n \n \"That\u0027s just it,\" replied Reginald, with some animation, slipping Una\u0027s letter into his pocket. \"I am a country fellow, accustomed to lead a quiet simple life--and not an artificial existence.\" \n \n \"Oh, you\u0027ll soon get used to it.\" \n \n \"No doubt, but I\u0027m not going to make the attempt.\" \n \n \"Oh, indeed!\" observed Beaumont, concealing his annoyance. \"So you intend to return to that dead-and-alive hole of a Garsworth?\" \n \n \"Hole, as you think it,\" replied the young man, with some warmth, \"it has been my home for many a long year, and I have grown to love it; besides, you forget--I go back to be married.\" \n \n \"But surely not yet?\" objected Beaumont, earnestly. \"Your father has not been dead very long? Besides, you must have a fling as a bachelor before you become Benedict, the married man.\" \n \n \"I\u0027ve had enough \u0027fling,\u0027 as you call it,\" said Reginald, coldly, \"and I don\u0027t like it--this incessant high-pressure style of life is not to my taste, so I am going away from it.\" \n \n \"I\u0027m afraid I cannot leave Town, just now,\" said the artist, with a frown, feeling his prey was slipping through his fingers. \n \n Blake looked at him in surprise. \n \n \"I do not want you to leave Town,\" he observed, in a dignified manner. \"There is no necessity for you to accompany me by any manner of means--you have your own life and your own friends, I have mine, so there is nothing in common between us in any way. You have certainly been very kind, in offering to assist me as a singer, but, as I do not require your assistance now, of course I will not trouble you. No doubt I have taken up a considerable portion of your time since I have been in London, but I am willing to repay any loss you may have sustained, in whatever way you suggest.\" \n \n He looked straight at Beaumont as he spoke; and that gentleman, feeling rather nonplussed by the calm dignity of the young man, had the grace to blush a little, while he rapidly calculated on his next move. His financial affairs were not by any means in a flourishing condition at present, and he would have liked to ask Blake to give him some money; but, not judging the time ripe enough to prefer such a request, he temporised in a crafty manner. \n \n \"You misunderstand me,\" he said smoothly. \"What I have done, is out of pure kindness, and I want no return for it. If you feel inclined to return to Garsworth, of course you are your own master, and can do so. Some day, I may run down to see you, and if I can be of any assistance to you, in connection with the management of your estates, of course I will only be too happy to do what I can.\" \n \n \"Thank you, I will not forget your offer,\" replied Reginald, still rather coldly, for he did not like the masterful tone adopted by the artist. \"And now, if you will excuse me, I\u0027ll go and pack up my portmanteau.\" \n \n \"Oh, I\u0027ll come and see you off, at Paddington,\" said Beaumont, cheerily; \"what train are you going by?\" \n \n \"The mid-day train,\" answered Blake, glancing at his watch. \n \n \"Then I\u0027ll see you on the platform,\" observed Beaumont, rising to his feet and taking up his hat. \"By-the-way, what about your engagements for this week?\" \n \n \"I\u0027ll have to break them--none are very important, and most rather expensive.\" \n \n Beaumont, biting his lips at this home-thrust, made no reply beyond a careless laugh; and, putting on his hat, left the room with a jaunty air. Once outside, however, his face changed to an expression of deep anger; for his success with Blake, hitherto, had not led him to expect such a calm resistance to his wishes. \n \n \"You\u0027ll defy me, will you?\" he muttered between his teeth, as he walked rapidly along the street. \"I\u0027ll see about that, my boy--as I put you in possession of the property, I can also take it off you again; and I\u0027ll do it, unless you\u0027re guided by me. I\u0027ll wait till you go back to Garsworth, and follow shortly afterwards. Once you know the truth, and I don\u0027t think you\u0027ll be so anxious to get rid of your best friend. I can leave you rich--or make you a pauper; so the whole of your future life is in my hands, and I\u0027ll mould it as I please.\" \n \n Though he was annoyed at the unexpected display of firmness made by Blake, he was not alarmed, knowing he held the strongest hand in the game, and that Reginald would be forced to yield everything up to him, if he wanted to remain rich. Still, it was most irritating, for no one likes the worm to turn, as it is plainly the duty of the worm to be trodden upon; and for such a miserable thing as the worm to resent its fate, is going in direct opposition to the laws of Nature. However, there is an exception to every rule; and in this case Mr. Beaumont\u0027s worm was a more daring animal than he had any idea of; and, in spite of being the strongest party, he might well doubt with whom the victory would ultimately rest. \n \n However, Beaumont\u0027s habitual self-command came to his aid, and prevented him showing any irritation, when he stood on the Paddington platform at the window of a smoking carriage, wishing Reginald good-bye. \n \n \"I hope you have enjoyed your stay in London,\" he said heartily. \n \n \"So-so,\" answered Reginald wearily. \"I cannot enjoy anything very much, knowing the circumstances of my birth.\" \n \n \"Nonsense! You\u0027ll soon forget all about that.\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t think so, unfortunately for myself I have not your happy facility for forgetting.\" \n \n \"Pshaw! You are rich, and gold hides everything.\" \n \n \"From the eyes of the world, yes; but not from a man\u0027s own sight--nobody knows but the wearer where the shoe pinches.\" \n \n \"If that is the case, let the wearer smile blandly and the world will never guess his shoe doesn\u0027t fit him--it\u0027s your fools, who wear their hearts on their sleeves, that get the worst word of everyone.\" \n \n \"And the wise man who conceals a vicious life gets the praise,\" said Blake bitterly. \"What a delightful world.\" \n \n \"It\u0027s the best of all possible worlds,\" retorted Beaumont cynically. \"I agree with M. Voltaire--besides, the world always takes you at your own valuation; smile, and it smiles; frown, and it looks grim; each man is a mirror to another, and gives back the reflection he receives.\" \n \n \"What cold-blooded philosophy.\" \n \n \"No doubt, but a very necessary philosophy,\" retorted Beaumont in a good-humoured tone; \"it\u0027s ridiculous to bring the simplicity of Arcady to Rome. France tried it under the Fourteenth Louis, and the experiment ended in the guillotine and the Carmagnole.\" \n \n The train was now moving off, so he shook hands with the young man through the open window of the carriage. \n \n \"Good-bye,\" said Reginald heartily, \"when you come to Garsworth, I\u0027ll be glad to see you, my friend.\" \n \n \"Friend,\" echoed Beaumont with an evil smile, as the long train steamed away, \"next time you see me it will be as your master.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1864/53975.html","bookId":826,"book":{"id":826,"title":"The Man with a Secret","description":"简介： It was the high road to the village of Garsworth, wide, deeply rutted, and somewhat grass-grown, with a tall hedge of yellow-blossomed gorse on the one side, and on the other a ragged, broken fence, over which leaned a man absorbed in meditation, his...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1864","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:37 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:37 AM"}}
