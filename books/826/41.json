{"id":18621,"no":41,"title":"CHAPTER XLI. A WOMAN\u0027S HEART.","content":"When Dame Fortune frowns severest, \n \n Then I love thee best of all, \n \n I will cling to thee, my dearest,/p\u003e \n \n Though the world in ruins fall. \n \n Dr. Larcher was in his study talking to Reginald Blake, who sat near the writing table, leaning his head upon his hand with his arm resting on the desk. The face of the good Vicar was somewhat clouded, as he felt deeply for the unhappy young man, and he was trying to speak words of comfort to him, although he felt how difficult it was to converse cheerfully under present circumstances. Reginald, however, had taken this second discovery more easily than he had done the first, perhaps because he had suffered so much already that he could not suffer more. At all events, his face, though pale, was perfectly composed, and there was a look of determination about his lips and a serene light in his eyes which gave great satisfaction to Dr. Larcher. \n \n \"I must say, my dear boy,\" he said kindly, \"that you have great cause for sorrow, but you must bear adversity like a man, and I feel sure the result will be beneficial to your future life--sooner or later we all feel what Goethe calls \u0027world sorrow,\u0027 and it is that which changes us from careless youth to thoughtful manhood--your trial has come earlier and has been a more bitter one than that of most men, but believe me, out of this apparent evil good will come; remember the saying of the old Roman lyrist, Perrupit Acheronta Herculeus labor--time will bring you relief, and, if you resist manfully, you also will be able to break through this Acheron of sorrow and pain.\" \n \n Reginald listened attentively to this long discourse, and, at its conclusion, lifted his head proudly. \n \n \"I agree with all you say, sir,\" he replied steadily, \"and hope to profit by your advice, but you must not think me a mere weakling who gives in without a struggle when trials come. No, I think your training has taught me more than that. I feel bitterly the circumstances of my birth, and in having parents I can neither honour nor respect, but the cruellest blow of all is that I must renounce all hope of the woman I love--it is very hard, indeed, to almost gain the prize and then lose it through no fault of my own.\" \n \n \"I think you misjudge Una,\" said the vicar quietly, \"she is not the woman to act in such a way--in fact, now that you have met with misfortune, I think she will love you more than before.\" \n \n \"I hope so, yet I doubt it,\" replied the young man gloomily; \"but now that all my past is ended in ruin I must look to the future and try and win a respected name--which I have not got now. But first, what am I to do about my parents?\" \n \n \"Regarding your father,\" said the vicar thoughtfully, \"I don\u0027t think you will see any more of him, as he will probably leave the village to-day--now that he can gain nothing from you he will probably leave you alone--but as to your mother, your place is certainly by her side.\" \n \n \"But look how she has deceived me.\" \n \n \"If she has erred it is through love of you,\" replied Dr. Larcher gravely, \"and after all she is bound to you by the ties of nature. Yes, you must look after her; but what about yourself?\" \n \n \"I will go to London and make a fortune by my voice.\" \n \n \"Your last sojourn in London was not productive of any good result,\" said the vicar in gentle rebuke. \n \n \"Perhaps not, but if I erred it was with my head not my heart. I was miserable, and tried to drown my sorrows in dissipation, but now I go to town under widely different circumstances--a pauper where I once was wealthy--so my only dissipation now will be hard work.\" \n \n \"That is right,\" said the vicar, approvingly. \"I am glad to see you accept the inevitable in such spirit--levius fit patientia Quidquid corrigere est nefas.\" \n \n \"It\u0027s the only spirit in which I can accept the future,\" answered Reginald sadly, \"seeing that I am to pass the rest of my life without Una.\" \n \n \"As I said before, you wrong her; she is too noble a woman to leave you now you are in trouble.\" \n \n \"I wish I was as certain as you are,\" said Blake, rising to his feet and walking to and fro, \"but after what has passed I am afraid to hope.\" \n \n At this moment a knock came to the door, and immediately afterwards Una Challoner entered. She looked pale in her dark mourning garments, but there was a soft light in her eyes as they rested on Reginald which comforted the vicar greatly. \n \n \"Welcome, my dear,\" he said heartily, rising and taking her hand, \"you could not have come at a happier time. Reginald has great need of you, so I will leave you both together, and I hope you will prove the David to his Saul, in order to chase away the evil shadow that is on him.\" \n \n When the vicar had departed and closed the door after him Una stood in silence, looking at Reginald, who had sat down again. So sad, so despondent was his attitude, that all the love of her heart went out towards him, and walking gently up to her lover she touched his shoulder. \n \n \"Reginald.\" \n \n \"Yes,\" he said, lifting his heavy eyes to her face. \"What is it? Have you come to reproach me?\" \n \n \"Reproach you with what, my poor boy?\" she asked, tenderly, kneeling beside him. \"What have you done that I should come to you with harsh words?\" \n \n \"You are a good woman, Una,\" said Blake sadly, putting his hand caressingly upon her head, \"but I think there is a limit even to your forbearance.\" \n \n \"What nonsense you talk,\" she said lightly. \"I understand everything--you are not responsible for the sins of your parents.\" \n \n \"I cannot marry you now,\" he replied in a low voice. \"I can offer you nothing except poverty and a dishonoured name.\" \n \n \"You can offer me yourself,\" said Una with a smile, \"and that is all I want. As to your dishonoured name, you forget you have given that up--your name now is Reginald Garsworth.\" \n \n \"It was, but I surrender it with the property.\" \n \n \"I hardly see that, seeing there is no question of surrender. Yes,\" she went on, seeing the astonishment depicted on his face, \"things are going to remain exactly as they are. You will still be titular lord of the manor, and we will look upon this conspiracy of your unhappy parents as if it had never existed.\" \n \n \"Impossible,\" he muttered. \"I cannot rob you of your property.\" \n \n \"Don\u0027t I tell you there is no robbery?\" she replied rapidly. \"As man and wife we will share the property in common, so there is no necessity for you to surrender what will soon come back to you by marriage.\" \n \n \"I had given up all hope of the marriage!\" \n \n \"Ah! you don\u0027t know how determined I am when I take a thing into my head,\" she said playfully. \"We will be married next week, and you will retain the property just as if nothing had occurred. No one knows the truth of the affair except your parents, and they will not speak.\" \n \n \"My father will, I know his vindictive nature.\" \n \n \"Your father!\" she repeated contemptuously. \"Don\u0027t speak of Basil Beaumont by that name. He has been no father to you, and as for speaking you can set your mind at rest. He called upon me this morning, and I soon settled everything.\" \n \n \"He called on you?\" \n \n \"Yes, with a lot of lies in his mouth, but I threatened to prosecute him if he did not leave the village, so by this time I think he is out of the neighbourhood. Don\u0027t trouble, my dear, Beaumont will hold his tongue for his own sake.\" \n \n \"And my mother?\" \n \n \"I called at Kossiter\u0027s as I passed,\" she answered, \"and found your mother had gone up to London this morning. We must find her out and give her some money to live on, for after all, whatever part she has taken in this conspiracy it was for love of you.\" \n \n \"Just what Dr. Larcher said.\" \n \n \"So you see everything is settled,\" she said joyously, rising from her knees, \"we will be married next week and you will be master of Garsworth Grange.\" \n \n Reginald was deeply affected by her noble conduct, and rising to his feet embraced her fondly. \n \n \"You are a noble woman,\" he said, with tears in his eyes, \"but can I accept this sacrifice?\" \n \n \"Why will you use such a word?--there is no sacrifice in what I do for the man I love.\" \n \n \"Remember I bring you nothing.\" \n \n \"You bring me yourself, that is all I want. Let the past be forgotten. When we are married you will forget all the troubles you have had.\" \n \n He kissed her, smiling. \n \n \"You are my good angel,\" he said simply. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1864/53982.html","bookId":826,"book":{"id":826,"title":"The Man with a Secret","description":"简介： It was the high road to the village of Garsworth, wide, deeply rutted, and somewhat grass-grown, with a tall hedge of yellow-blossomed gorse on the one side, and on the other a ragged, broken fence, over which leaned a man absorbed in meditation, his...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1864","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:37 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:37 AM"}}
