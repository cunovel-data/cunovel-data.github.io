{"id":18620,"no":40,"title":"CHAPTER XL. BEAUMONT PLAYS HIS LAST CARD.","content":"Though he seems to thee an angel \\n\\n \\n\\n Let him not thy heart beguile, \\n\\n \\n\\n He\u0027s a devil from a strange hell, \\n\\n \\n\\n Evil lurks beneath his smile. \\n\\n \\n\\n Round the old Grange the winds were howling dismally, and now that the thaw had set in the sadness of the place was increased by the incessant dripping of the melted snow. The dead leaves in the park were sodden and heavy, so heavy, indeed, that they could not be moved by the keen wind, which, in revenge, shook the bare boughs of the trees, or whistled dismally through the cracks and crannies of the old building. \\n\\n \\n\\n Una sat at the window of the parlour looking out at the heavy, grey sky, to which the bleak trees lifted up their gaunt arms, and listening to the monotonous dripping on the terrace. But, in spite of the dreariness and solitude of the place, surely her heart should have been lighter and her face gayer than it was, seeing that in a few days she was going to be united to the man she loved. But the shadow on the dismal landscape also rested upon her face, and even the lively chatter of Miss Cassy about the wedding could not bring a smile into her mournful eyes. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure, Una dear, I\u0027m glad you\u0027re going to be married,\" said Miss Cassy, who had put the tea cosy on her head preparatory to leaving the room, \"but really I don\u0027t know what\u0027s coming over things; you look so sad--quite like a mourner, you know--the Mourning Bride of what\u0027s-his-name--and then for Patience to stay away all night! Why does she do it?--why!--why!--she never did it before, and then those letters you got this morning, what are they about?--it\u0027s all so odd, I really don\u0027t know what things are coming to.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Things are going very well, aunt,\" said Una with a faint smile. \"Patience stayed all night in the village because of the storm last night, and as to those letters, I\u0027ll tell you all about them later on.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, do, let me share your confidence, at least. I brought you up from pinafores, you know, quite like my own child. Oh, I wish I had one. Why haven\u0027t I a child? Now, I know what you\u0027re going to say--marriage, of course--but I\u0027ve never had the chance, nobody wanted to marry me--so odd--I would have made a loving wife--quite like an ivy--really a clinging ivy. Oh, if I could only find my oak.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The little lady fluttered tearfully out of the room, leaving Una sitting alone with the letters on her lap, looking out at the dreary scene. She sighed sadly, and gathering the letters together arose from her chair, when just at that moment a ring came to the front-door bell. Una started apprehensively and her pale face grew yet paler, but she said nothing, only stood like a statue by the window with an expectant look upon her face. Hardly had the harsh jingle of the bell ceased to echo through the house when Jellicks entered, and wriggling up to Una, announced in a hissing whisper that Mr. Beaumont desired to see her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mr. Beaumont,\" murmured Una, starting suddenly, \"what does he want, I wonder? I\u0027d better see him, it may do some good--some good. Yes!\" she said aloud, \"I will see him; Jellicks, show Mr. Beaumont into this room.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She resumed her seat by the window as Jellicks vanished, and shortly afterwards the door opened and Basil Beaumont, looking haggard and fierce, stood before her. He bowed, but did not attempt any warmer greeting, and she, on her part, simply pointed to a chair near her, upon which he took his seat. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I suppose you are astonished to see me, Miss Challoner?\" he said, after a pause. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I confess I am a little,\" she replied calmly, \"I thought you were up in London.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"So I was, but I came down to Garsworth yesterday.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Indeed? Our quiet little village must have great attractions to draw you away from London.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I did not come down without an object, Miss Challoner,\" he said gravely, \"I have a duty to fulfil.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Towards whom?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yourself. Yes, I came down from London especially to see you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s very kind of you to take so much trouble upon my account,\" she said coldly, looking keenly at him. \"May I ask what this duty is to which you allude?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is the duty of an honest man towards a wronged woman,\" said Beaumont quietly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Meaning me?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Meaning yourself,\" he asserted solemnly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You speak in riddles, Mr. Beaumont,\" said Una, folding her hands. \"I will be very glad if you will explain them.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Certainly. Two months ago your cousin died and left all his property to a supposed son, who turned out to be Reginald Blake; I have now to inform you that Reginald Blake is no connection whatever of Squire Garsworth, consequently his assumption of the property is a fraud.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What do you mean, sir?\" said Una quickly. \"I understood Mr. Blake\u0027s identity was fully established----\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, by Patience Allerby,\" interrupted Beaumont quickly. \"She said he was the son of Fanny Blake and the Squire, knowing such a statement to be false.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then who are Mr. Blake\u0027s parents?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Patience Allerby and myself.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Una arose from her seat with an angry colour in her cheeks. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You--you Reginald\u0027s father--impossible!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s perfectly true,\" he replied calmly. \"Patience Allerby came up to London many years ago with me, and when Reginald was born she left me and came down here, bringing up our son under another name. I, as you know, came to Garsworth some time ago, and saw her again, but she asked me to say nothing, so I obeyed her, but now that I find she has committed a fraud, of which you are the victim, I naturally hasten to put it right.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Did Mr. Blake know he was not the heir?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He did from the first,\" asserted Beaumont audaciously. \"I have no doubt his mother told him his true birth, and knowing the Squire\u0027s mania about re-incarnation they made this conspiracy up together in order to defraud you of the property.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"So Mr. Blake has deceived me?\" said Una, in an unnaturally quiet tone. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, he has deceived you all along. I have no doubt he prepared all the forged documents which proved his identity with the supposed son, and counted on your love for him not to prosecute should anything be discovered. I\u0027m glad I have been able to warn you in time. You will never marry him now.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But the property; do you think he will keep the property?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He will try to I\u0027ve no doubt,\" said Beaumont gravely, \"but if you intrust your case to experienced hands, I have no doubt he will be made to disgorge his plunder.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But to whom can I turn?\" said Una helplessly. \"I have no friend.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Beaumont arose to his feet, and came close to her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, you have one--myself.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You?\" she cried, recoiling with a shudder. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes. I love you passionately, Una, and if you will be my wife, I will recover your property for you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But--your own son?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I despise a son who could act as Reginald has done. I came down here expecting to find an honourable man, but instead I discover a scoundrel, a forger, and a thief.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is it all true what you have said?\" murmured Una, looking straight at him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All true,\" he answered solemnly, \"I swear it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You liar!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He started back in amazement, for she was facing him like an enraged tigress, with crimson cheeks and blazing eyes. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What do you mean?\" he said in a hoarse whisper. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mean?\" she repeated scornfully. \"That I know all, Basil Beaumont. Do you see this letter? I received it from your unhappy son this morning, giving me back the property and revealing the whole of your nefarious scheme. I know who forged the documents--you! I know who hoped to enjoy the money through Reginald--you! I know who comes with lies on his lips to part me from the only man I love--you! Yes--you! you! you!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The baffled schemer stood nervously fingering his hat, with a white sullen face, all his courage having left him. So mean, so cowardly, so despicable he looked, shrinking back against the wall before this young girl, who towered over him like an inspired Pythoness. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You tell me Reginald Blake knew of this base conspiracy,\" she said with contempt. \"Does this letter look like it? You say he will refuse to give up the property--this letter says he surrenders it of his own free will--and you have the insolence to speak of love to me. You--who so shamefully tricked and betrayed Patience Allerby--you contemptible hound!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He tried to smile defiantly, and made an effort to form a word with his white quivering lips, but both attempts were a failure, and without glancing at her he slunk towards the door, looking like a beaten hound. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, slink away like the craven you are,\" she cried disdainfully, \"and leave Garsworth at once, or I will prosecute you for your scoundrelly conduct. Yes, though you were twenty times Reginald\u0027s father.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve spoilt his chance anyhow,\" he hissed venomously. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You have spoilt nothing of the sort,\" she retorted superbly. \"Do you think I believe the words of a vile thing like you against this letter? I am going to Reginald Blake, to day, and will place myself and my fortune in his hands--in spite of your falsehoods I will marry him, and he will still be master of Garsworth Grange--but, as for you, leave the village at once, or I will have you hounded out of it, as you deserve to be--you cur!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He was white with anger and shame, tried to speak, but with an imperious gesture she stopped him with one word: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Go!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He slunk out of the door at once, a ruined and disgraced man. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1864/53981.html","bookId":826,"book":{"id":826,"title":"The Man with a Secret","description":"简介： It was the high road to the village of Garsworth, wide, deeply rutted, and somewhat grass-grown, with a tall hedge of yellow-blossomed gorse on the one side, and on the other a ragged, broken fence, over which leaned a man absorbed in meditation, his...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1864","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:37 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:37 AM"}}
