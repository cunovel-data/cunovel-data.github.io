{"id":41675,"no":16,"title":"Chapter 15: A Narrow Escape.","content":"Keeping in the mud close to the bank, and feeling their way in the dense growth produced by the overhanging bushes, they crawled forward. Sometimes the water came up to the bank, and they had to swim; but as a rule they were able to keep on the mud, which was so deep that they sank far into it, their heads alone showing above it. In two hours they had gone a mile, and both were thoroughly exhausted. \"We will lie here till day breaks,\" Lisle said; \"as soon as it is dawn, we will choose some spot where the bushes are thickest, and shelter there. I am in hopes, now, that we are beyond the Ashantis. I dare say that we shall be able to get a peep through the bushes and, if we find the coast clear, we will make our way into the forest. There we may be able to gather something to eat, which we shall want, tomorrow; and it will certainly be more comfortable than this bed of mud. We must get rid of some of that before we leave.\" \"It would be better to allow it to dry on you, sahib. Our white undergarments would betray us at once, if any Ashantis came upon us. For my part, my colour is not so very different from theirs.\" \"Yes, perhaps that would be better. I must rub some over my face, as well.\" \"I do not care, for myself, sahib; we Sikhs are not afraid to die; but after your goodness to me, I would do anything to save you.\" \"What is your name?\" \"Pertab, sahib.\" \"Well, Pertab, I think that as we have proceeded so far, we shall pull through, somehow. You have your bayonet, and I have my revolver, which I will wash and load before we get out of this. We shall be a match, then, for any three or four men we may come across. At any rate, I shall shoot myself if I see that there is no other way of escape. It would be a thousand times better to die, than be taken captive and tortured to death.\" \"Good, sahib! I will use my bayonet, myself; but I don\u0027t think there will be any occasion for that.\" \"I shall certainly die fighting. I would rather not be taken alive, Pertab; and shall certainly fight till I am killed, or can take my own life.\" \"Do you think that the troops will be marched away, sahib?\" \"I feel sure that they will. They have only got provisions enough to take them back to camp; and as, when they pull the wire in, they will find that we have gone, they will feel quite sure that we have been drowned. \"No; we must quite make up our minds that we have got to look after ourselves. Fortunately, the Ashantis will not be able to cross the river to harass them in their retreat; unless, indeed, they know of some ford by which they can get over.\" As soon as daylight began, the Sikh went down into the water and washed the mud from himself, and Lisle cleaned and loaded his pistol. Then they waited until it was broad daylight and, as they heard no sounds to indicate that any Ashantis were near, Lisle climbed up as noiselessly as he could to the bushes, and looked cautiously round. There were none of the enemy in sight. He therefore called to the Sikh to join him and, together, they made their way into the forest behind. \"The first thing to ascertain,\" Lisle said, \"is whether the enemy are still here, and to find out for certain whether our friends have left. If they stay where they were, we can swim the river and join them; if they have retreated, and the Ashantis are still here, we shall know that there is no ford. If, however, we find that the Ashantis have gone, we shall be sure that they crossed at some ford, and will be swarming round our men; in which case it will be impossible for us to join them, and we must make our way as best we can.\" They kept close to the edge of the forest, the soldier occasionally using his bayonet to cut away the thorny creepers that blocked their course. After an hour\u0027s walking, Lisle said: \"That is the spot where the troops were, last night. I can see no signs of them now. \"Now for the Ashantis.\" They took the greatest pains to avoid making a noise, until they stepped out opposite the point from which they had started, the evening before. They saw no signs of the enemy. \"This is bad,\" Lisle said. \"I can have no doubt that they have crossed the river, somewhere, and are swarming in the forest opposite. However, now that we know that they have gone, we can look out for something to eat.\" For three hours they wandered about, and were fortunate enough to find a deserted village, where they gathered some bananas and pineapples. Of these they made a hearty meal; and then, each carrying a few bananas, they returned to the river and swam across, finding no difficulty in doing so now that they were unencumbered by the wire. They had not been long across before they heard the sound of heavy firing, some two or three miles away. \"It is as I thought,\" Lisle said. \"The Ashantis have crossed the river, somewhere, and are now attacking the convoy. They will not, of course, overpower it; but they will continue to follow it up till they get near camp, and there is little chance of our being able to rejoin them before that.\" Travelling on, they more than once heard the sound of parties of the enemy, running forward at the top of their speed. Evidently news had been sent round, and the inhabitants of many villages now poured in, to share in the attack upon the white men. \"It is useless for us to think of going farther, at present,\" Lisle said. \"They will be mustering thickly all round our force, and I expect we shall have some stiff fighting to do, before we get back to camp--I mean the column, of course; as for ourselves, the matter is quite uncertain. We may be sure, however, that they won\u0027t be making any search in the bush and, as even in the Ashanti country you cannot go through the bush, unless you cut a path, it will be sheer accident if they come across us. At any rate, we may as well move slowly on, doing a little cutting only when the path seems deserted. If we keep some forty or fifty yards from it, so as to be able to hear any parties going along, and to make sure that they are moving in our direction, that is all we can do. \"Of course, everything will depend upon the result of the fight with the column. There is no doubt that they are going to be attacked in great force; which, as far as it goes, is all the better for us. If it were only a question of sniping by a small body of men, the colonel would no doubt push steadily on, contenting himself with firing occasional volleys into the bush; but if he is attacked by so strong a body as there appears to be round him, he will halt and give them battle. If so, we may be pretty sure that he will send them flying into the bush; and they won\u0027t stop running till they get back to the river. In that case, when we have allowed them all to pass we can go boldly on, and overtake the column at their halting place, this evening. \"If, on the other hand, our fellows make a running fight of it, the enemy will follow them till they get near Coomassie, and we shall have to make a big detour to get in. That we shall be able to do so I have no doubt, but the serious part of the business is the question of food. However, we know that the natives can find food, and it is hard if we do not manage to get some. \"Making the necessary detour, and cutting our way a good deal through the bush, we can calculate upon getting there in less than four days\u0027 march. We have food enough for today, and a very little will enable us to hold on for the next four days.\" They moved slowly on. The firing increased in violence, and it was evident that a very heavy engagement was going on. Two hours later they heard a sound of hurrying feet in the path and, peering through the bush, saw a crowd of the Ashantis running along, in single file, at the top of their speed. \"Hooray! It is evident that they have got a thorough licking,\" Lisle said. \"They will soon be all past. Our greatest fear will then be that a few of the most plucky of them will rally in the bush, when they see that none of our troops come along. Our troops are not likely to follow them up, as they will be well content with the victory they have evidently gained, and resume their march.\" They waited for an hour and, when they were on the point of getting up and making for the path, the Sikh said: \"Someone is coming in the bush.\" In another minute, four natives came suddenly upon them; whether they came from the force that had been routed, or were newly arriving from some village behind, the two fugitives knew not; nor, indeed, had they any time to consider. They threw themselves, at once, into one of the divisions at the base of a giant cotton tree. These divisions, of which there may be five or six round the tree, form solid buttresses four or five inches thick, projecting twenty or thirty feet from the front, and rising as many feet high; thus affording the tree an immense support, when assailed by tropical storms. Illustration: Two of them fell before Lisle\u0027s revolver. The natives, seeing that the two men were apparently unarmed, rushed forward, firing their guns as they did so. Two of them fell before Lisle\u0027s revolver. One of the natives rushed with clubbed musket at him but, as he delivered the blow, the butt end of the musket struck a bough overhead and flew out of the man\u0027s hand; and Lisle, putting his revolver to his head, shot him. The other man ran off. Lisle had now time to look round and, to his dismay, the Sikh was leaning against the branch of a tree. \"Are you hit?\" he asked. \"Yes, sahib, a ball has broken my right leg.\" \"That is a bad business, indeed,\" Lisle said, kneeling beside him. \"It cannot be helped, sahib. Our fate is meted out to us all, and it has come to me now. You could not drag me from here, or carry me; it would be impossible, for I weigh far more than you do.\" Lisle was silent for a moment. \"I see,\" he said, \"that the only thing I can do is to push on to camp, and bring out assistance. I will leave you my pistol, when I have recharged it; so that if the native who has run away should bring others down, you will be able to defend yourself. As, however, you remained on your feet, he will not know that you were wounded; and will probably suppose that we would at once push on to join our companions. Still, it will be well for you to have the weapon. \"Now, let me lower you down to the ground, and seat you as comfortably as I can. I will leave these bananas by you, and my flask of water. It is lucky, now, that I did not drink it all when I started to cross the river. \"I suppose they will have halted at the same camp as before. It was a long march, and we must still be ten or twelve miles away from it, so I fear it will be dark long before I get there.\" \"You are very good, sahib, but I think it will be of no use.\" \"Oh, I hope it will! So now, give me your turban. I will wrap it tightly round your leg, for the bleeding must be stopped. I see you have lost a great deal of blood, already.\" He bandaged the wound as well as he could, and then he said: \"I will take your sword bayonet with me. It can be of no use to you and, if I do happen to meet a native upon the road, it may come in very handy.\" \"The blessing of the Great One be upon you, sahib, and take you safely to camp. As for myself, I think that my race is run.\" \"You must not think that,\" Lisle said, cheerily; \"you must lie very quiet, and make up your mind that, as soon as it is possible, we shall be back here for you;\" and then, without any more talk, he made his way to the edge of the path. There he made a long gash on the bark of a tree and, fifty yards farther, he made two similar gashes. Then, certain that he could find the place on his return, he went off at a trot along the path. It was eight o\u0027clock in the evening before he reached camp. On the way, he had met with nothing that betokened danger; there had been no voices in the woods. When about halfway to camp, he came across a number of dead bodies on the path and, looking into the bush, found many more scattered about. It was evident that the little British force had turned upon their assailants, and had effected a crushing defeat upon them. He was hailed by a sentry as he approached the camp but, upon his reply, was allowed to pass. As he came to the light of a fire, round which the white officers were sitting, there was a general shout of surprise and pleasure. \"Is it you or your ghost, Bullen?\" the commanding officer exclaimed, as all leapt to their feet. \"I am a very solid person, Colonel; as you will see, if you offer me anything to eat or drink. I am pretty well exhausted now and, as I have got another twenty-mile tramp before I sleep, you may guess that I shall be glad of solid and liquid refreshment.\" \"You shall have both, my dear boy. We had all given you up for dead. When we saw you washed down, we were afraid that you were lost. The only hope was that the current might bring you over to our side again, and we went two or three miles down the stream to look for you. We hunted again still more carefully the next morning, and it was not until the afternoon that we moved. \"We encamped only three miles from the river, hoping still that you might come up before the morning. We started at daybreak this morning. We were harassed from the first, but the affair became so serious that we halted and faced about, left a handful of men to protect the coolies and carriers; and then sent two companies out into the bush on each side, and went at them. Fortunately they fought pluckily, and when at last they gave way they left, I should say, at least a third of their number behind them. \"We did not stop to count. I sent a small party at full speed along the path, so as to keep them on the run, and then marched on here without further molestation. \"And now, about yourself; how on earth have you managed to get in?\" \"Well, sir, I can tell it in a few words. The current took us to the opposite shore. We lay concealed under the bushes overhanging the bank, and could hear the enemy talking behind the screen. On the following day the voices ceased, and we made our way up to the camp; and found, as we expected, that you had gone and, as we guessed, the Ashantis had set off in pursuit. We went on through the forest and, of course, heard the firing in the distance; and saw the enemy coming along the path, terror stricken. We were waiting for a bit, and felt sure that they had all passed; when a party of four men came from behind upon us. I don\u0027t think they belonged to the force you defeated. They were within twenty yards when they saw us. \"We jumped into one of the hollows at the foot of a cotton tree. The whole four fired at us and then, as they supposed that we were unarmed, made a rush. I shot two of them as they came on. One of the others aimed a blow at me, with the butt end of his gun. Fortunately the weapon caught one of the creepers, and flew out of his hand. My revolver had in some way stuck, but it all came right just at the moment, and I shot him. The fourth man bolted. \"When I looked round to see what the Sikh was doing, he was leaning against the tree, with the blood streaming from his leg; the bone having been broken by one of their balls. Well, sir, I bandaged it up as well as I could, and left him my revolver; so that he might shoot himself, if there was a likelihood of his being captured. I then set off, as hard as I could go, to fetch assistance for him.\" \"The troops have had a very heavy day, Bullen,\" the colonel said, gravely. \"How far away is it that you left the man?\" \"About ten miles, I should say.\" \"Well, they are all willing fellows, but it is a serious thing to ask them to start on another twenty miles\u0027 journey, within an hour or two of getting into camp.\" \"I think, sir, if you will allow me to go down to where the Sikhs are bivouacked, and I ask for volunteers to bring in their comrade, they will stand up, to a man.\" Lisle\u0027s confidence in the Sikhs was not misplaced. As soon as they heard that a comrade, who they believed had been drowned while trying to get the wire across the river, was lying alone and wounded in the forest, all declared their willingness to start, at once. \"I will take twenty,\" Lisle said; \"that will be ample. I have just come down the path myself, and I saw no signs, whatever, of the enemy; still, some of them may be making their way down, to carry off their dead. If they are, however, their astonishment at seeing us will be so great that they will bolt at the first volley.\" \"Are you going back with us, sahib?\" \"Yes, I must do so, or you would never find the place where he is lying.\" \"We will take two stretchers,\" the sergeant--a splendid man; standing, like most of his companions, well over six feet--said, \"and you shall walk as far as you are able, and then we will carry you. When will you march, sahib?\" \"I am going to get something to eat and drink first and, if you will fall in, in half an hour I will be with you again.\" \"Where is Pertab wounded, sahib?\" \"He is shot through the leg, three or four inches above the knee, and the bone is broken.\" \"Did the man get off, sahib?\" \"I can\u0027t say for certain,\" Lisle said, with a smile. \"Four men attacked us. They all four fired. I shot three of them with my revolver, and the fourth bolted. Whether he was the man who really shot your comrade, or not, I cannot say; but you see, the chances are that he was not.\" The grim faces of the Sikhs lit up with a smile. \"You paid them out, anyhow,\" the sergeant said. \"I don\u0027t think we are very deeply in their debt.\" Lisle went back to the campfire. The best that could be found in camp was given to him, and the colonel handed him his own whisky flask. While he ate, he related the story in full. \"Well, it is a fine thing for you to have done,\" said the colonel; \"a most creditable affair. I know that you are a pretty good marcher; but I hardly think that, after a long day\u0027s work, you can set out for a march of nearly double the length.\" \"I have no fear of the march, Colonel. The Sikhs have volunteered to carry a stretcher for me. I shall, of course, not get into it, unless I feel that I cannot go another foot farther; but the mere fact that it is there, and in readiness for me, will help me to keep on. The Sikhs have done just as long a march as I have, and I hope that I shall be able to hold on as long as they can. I should hate to be beaten by a native.\" \"Ah! But these Sikhs are wonderful fellows; they seem to be made of iron, and march along as erect and freely as they start, when even the Hausas and Yorubas are showing signs that they are almost at the end of their powers. I must say that I consider the Sikhs to be, all round, the best soldiers in the world. They cannot beat Tommy Atkins, when it comes to a charge; but in the matter of marching, and endurance, Tommy has to take a back seat. He will hold on till he fairly breaks down, rather than give in; but he himself, if he has ever campaigned with the Sikhs, would be the first to allow that they can march him off his feet. \"Have you got a spare pair of shoes in your kit, Bullen?\" \"Yes.\" \"Then I should advise you to take those you have on, off; and put on a fresh pair.\" \"I will take your advice, sir; but I really think that it would be best to follow the custom of the native troops, and march barefooted.\" \"It would not do,\" the colonel said, decidedly. \"The soles of their feet are like leather. You would get half a dozen thorns in your foot, before you had gone half a mile; and would stub your toes against every root that projected across the path. No, no; stick to your shoes.\" Lisle changed his boots, and then went across to the Sikhs; who fell in as they saw him coming. \"You have got everything, sergeant?\" he asked. \"Yes; a hundred and thirty rounds of ball cartridge, the two stretchers, and some food and drink for our comrade.\" \"You have got a good supply of torches, I hope. There may be some small risk in carrying them, but I am convinced that the Ashantis will not venture to return, tonight, whatever they may do tomorrow. With three torches--one at the head, one in the middle of the line, and one in the rear--we should be able to travel through the paths better than if we had to grope our way in the dark.\" The little party at once moved off, many of the officers and men gathering round, to wish them good luck and a safe return. Four hours took them to the spot where Lisle had turned into the path. For the last mile he had had three torches burning in front, so that he should not overlook the signs he had made on the trees. \"There it is, sergeant,\" he said, at last, \"two slashes; the other one is on the left, fifty yards on.\" They turned off when they came to this. \"Here we are, all right, Pertab!\" Lisle said, as they came to the tree. \"Allah be praised!\" the man said, faintly. \"I seem to have been hearing noises in the wood, for a long time; and when I heard you coming, I was by no means sure that it was not an illusion, like the others.\" \"Here are twenty of your comrades with me, Pertab, and we shall soon get you into camp.\" \"I didn\u0027t expect you till morning,\" the wounded man said. \"I thought that you would be far too tired to come out and, without you, they could not have found me.\" \"They would have carried me, had it been necessary; but I managed to hold on pretty well. \"Now, my men, get him upon the stretcher, and let us be off. Pour the contents of that bottle down his throat; that will keep him up, till we get back.\" For another four or five miles, Lisle kept along but, to his mortification, he was obliged at last to take to the stretcher. The four Sikhs who carried it made light of his weight. Once or twice, on the way, some dropping shots were fired at the party; but these were speedily silenced by a volley or two from the rifles. It was four o\u0027clock in the morning when they re-entered camp. The fires were already lighted and, as the party entered, the troops received them with loud cheering; which called all the white officers out from their shelters. \"You have done well, my fine fellows,\" the colonel said to the Sikhs. \"Now, get some food at once, and then lie down for three or four hours\u0027 sleep. I shall leave two companies with you; I don\u0027t think that, after the thrashing we gave them yesterday, the enemy are likely to trouble us--at any rate, not before the afternoon, and by that time you will have rejoined us.\" \"We can march on now, sahib.\" \"No, no,\" the colonel said; \"a thirty-six-mile march, through this bush, is a great deal more than a fair day\u0027s march for anyone; and I am not going to see such good men knocked up, by asking too much of them. So just go, and do as I order you. You may be sure that I shall put the deed you have accomplished in my orders of today. \"Well, Mr. Bullen,\" he said, as he came to the spot where Lisle was sitting, with his shoes and stockings off, rubbing his aching feet, \"so you could not outmarch the Sikhs?\" \"No, sir, and I did not expect to do so. I went at their head all the way there, and four or five miles back; but should have had to give up, even if I had been told that a big fortune awaited me, if I got in on foot. I should have had to say: \"\u0027Well, then, somebody else may have it; I can go no farther.\u0027\" \"Well, you have done uncommonly well, anyhow; uncommonly well. I don\u0027t suppose there are five white men in camp who could have done so much. After this you may be sure that, if you have need of an expedition, the Sikhs would follow you through fire and water, if they were allowed to volunteer for the service. \"I should have been glad to recommend you for the Victoria Cross, for your conduct right through the affair; but you have got it. But I fear that, although you would get every credit for your doings, the authorities would consider that it did not come under the head of deeds for which the Victoria Cross is given.\" \"I am sure I have no desire for another V.C., even if two could be given.\" No attack was made on the following day, and it was evident that the Ashantis had taken to heart the lesson that had been given them. Two days later the column marched into the fort, and Colonel Willcocks went out to meet it. The colonel\u0027s reports had been sent in by a runner. As the Sikhs came along, the colonel ordered them to halt and, as Lisle marched up at the head of his company, he made a sign to him to come up. \"Captain Bullen,\" he said, \"I have much pleasure in congratulating you on the manner in which you saved the life of the Sikh soldier, who volunteered to swim that river in flood in order to carry a wire across; and still more for the manner in which you made what I should say was a record march, in this country, to bring in a man who had been wounded, in a fight with a small party of the enemy.\" Then he turned to the Sikhs. \"Soldiers,\" he said, \"I cannot praise you too heartily for having volunteered, at the end of a long and exhausting march, to undertake another still longer and more fatiguing, in order to bring in a wounded comrade. It is an act of which you may be proud; but not altogether a surprising one, for we know well that we can depend upon the Sikhs, on all and every occasion.\" Lisle had been carried into the fort. His feet were so tender and swollen that he could not possibly walk farther, and he was consequently taken down by the carriers, during the last two days\u0027 march. Hallett sauntered up, as soon as he was put into a hospital hut. \"Hillo, Bullen, so you have broken down! A nice example to set to your Hausas, isn\u0027t it?\" \"I suppose it is,\" Lisle laughed; \"but the Hausas did not march as far as I did.\" \"No? What were you doing? Scouting half a mile ahead of them, on your own account?\" \"Not exactly; I only went the width of a river, and yet, the result of that was that I had to do an extra march of some twenty miles.\" \"Now you are speaking in riddles, Lisle; and if there is one thing I hate, it is riddles. When a fellow begins to talk in that way, I always change the subject. Why a man should try to puzzle his brain, with such rigmarole things, is more than I can imagine.\" \"Well, Hallett, I really feel too tired to tell you about the matter. I can assure you that it is no joke, being carried down fifteen miles on a stretcher; so please go and ask somebody else, that\u0027s a good fellow.\" In a quarter of an hour Hallett returned again, put his eyeglass in his eye, and stood for a couple of minutes without speaking, regarding Lisle furtively. \"Oh, don\u0027t be a duffer,\" the latter said, \"and drop that eyeglass. You know perfectly well that you see better, without it, than with it.\" \"Well, you are a rum chap, Bullen. You are always doing something unexpected. I have been hearing how you and a Sikh started to swim the Ordah, when it was in flood, with a wire; how you were washed away; how you were given up for lost; how, two days later, you returned to camp and went straight out again, with a party of twenty Sikhs, took a little stroll for ten miles into the bush--and of course, as much back--to carry in the Sikh soldier you had had with you, but who had been wounded, and was unable to come with you. I don\u0027t know why such luck as this is always falling to your lot, while not a bit of it comes to me.\" \"It is pure accident, Hallett. You will get a chance, some day. I don\u0027t know that you would be good for a thirty-mile tramp, but it must be a consolation to you that, for the last five miles, I had to be carried.\" \"It is a mercy it is so,\" Hallett said, in an expression of deep thankfulness, \"for there would have been no holding you, if you had come in on your feet.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3139/86302.html","bookId":821,"book":{"id":821,"title":"Through Three Campaigns","description":"简介： Well, Lisle, my boy, the time is drawing very near when you will have to go home.
