{"id":93564,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"On a day in Full Earth so hot that it seemed to suck the breath from his chest before his body could use it, Roland of Gilead came to the gates of a village in the Desatoya Mountains. He was travelling alone by then, and would soon be travelling afoot, as well. This whole last week he had been hoping for a horse-doctor, but guessed such a fellow would do him no good now, even if this town had one. His mount, a two-year-old roan, was pretty well done for.\\n\\n The town gates, still decorated with flowers from some festival or other, stood open and welcoming, but the silence beyond them was all wrong. The gunslinger heard no clip-clop of horses, no rumble of wagon-wheels, no merchants\" huckstering cries from the marketplace. The only sounds were the low hum of crickets (some sort of bug, at any rate; they were a bit more tuneful than crickets, at that), a queer wooden knocking sound, and the faint, dreamy tinkle of small bells.\\n\\n Also, the flowers twined through the wrought-iron staves of the ornamental gate were long dead.\\n\\n Between his knees, Topsy gave two great, hollow sneezes-K\u0027chow! K\u0027chow!-and staggered sideways. Roland dismounted, partly out of respect for the horse, partly out of respect for himself-he didn\u0027t want to break a leg under Topsy if Topsy chose this moment to give up and canter into the clearing at the end of his path.\\n\\n The gunslinger stood in his dusty boots and faded jeans under the beating sun, stroking the roan\u0027s matted neck, pausing every now and then to yank his fingers through the tangles of Topsy\u0027s mane, and stopping once to shoo off the tiny flies clustering at the corners of Topsy\u0027s eyes. Let them lay their eggs and hatch their maggots there after Topsy was dead, but not before.\\n\\n Roland thus honoured his horse as best he could, listening to those distant, dreamy bells and the strange wooden tocking sound as he did. After a while he ceased his absent grooming and looked thoughtfully at the open gate.\\n\\n The cross above its centre was a bit unusual, but otherwise the gate was a typical example of its type, a western commonplace which was not useful but traditional-all the little towns he had come to in the last tenmonth seemed to have one such where you came in (grand) and one more such where you went out (not so grand). None had been built to exclude visitors, certainly not this one. It stood between two walls of pink adobe that ran into the scree for a distance of about twenty feet on either side of the road and then simply stopped. Close the gate, lock it with many locks, and all that meant was a short walk around one bit of adobe wall or the other.\\n\\n Beyond the gate, Roland could see what looked in most respects like a perfectly ordinary High Street-an inn, two saloons (one of which was called The Bustling Pig; the sign over the other was too faded to read), a mercantile, a smithy, a Gathering Hall. There was also a small but rather lovely wooden building with a modest bell-tower on top, a sturdy fieldstone foundation on bottom, and a gold-painted cross on its double doors. The cross, like the one over the gate, marked this as a worshipping place for those who held to the Jesus-man. This wasn\u0027t a common religion in Mid-World, but far from unknown; that same thing could have been said about most forms of worship in those days, including the worship of Baal, Asmodeus, and a hundred others. Faith, like everything else in the world these days, had moved on. As far as Roland was concerned, God o\" the Cross was just another religion which taught that love and murder were inextricably bound together-that in the end, God always drank blood.\\n\\n Meanwhile, there was the singing hum of insects which sounded almost like crickets. The dreamlike tinkle of the bells. And that queer wooden thumping, like a fist on a door. Or on a coffin top.\\n\\n Something here\u0027s a long way from right, the gunslinger thought. Ware, Roland; this place has a reddish odour.\\n\\n He led Topsy through the gate with its adornments of dead flowers and down the High Street. On the porch of the mercantile, where the old men should have congregated to discuss crops, politics, and the follies of the younger generation, there stood only a line of empty rockers. Lying beneath one, as if dropped from a careless (and long-departed) hand, was a charred corncob pipe. The hitching-rack in front of The Bustling Pig stood empty; the windows of the saloon itself were dark. One of the batwing doors had been yanked off and stood propped against the side of the building; the other hung ajar, its faded green slats splattered with maroon stuff that might have been paint but probably wasn\u0027t.\\n\\n The shopfront of the livery stable stood intact, like the face of a ruined woman who has access to good cosmetics, but the double barn behind it was a charred skeleton. That fire must have happened on a rainy day, the gunslinger thought, or the whole damned town would have gone up in flames; a jolly spin and raree for anyone around to see it.\\n\\n To his right now, halfway up to where the street opened into the town square, was the church. There were grassy borders on both sides, one separating the church from the town\u0027s Gathering Hall, the other from the little house set aside for the preacher and his family (if this was one of the Jesus-sects which allowed its shamans to have wives and families, that was; some of them, clearly administered by lunatics, demanded at least the appearance of celibacy). There were flowers in these grassy strips, and while they looked parched, most were still alive. So whatever had happened here to empty the place out had not happened long ago. A week, perhaps. Two at the outside, given the heat.\\n\\n Topsy sneezed again-K\u0027chow!-and lowered his head wearily.\\n\\n The gunslinger saw the source of the tinkling. Above the cross on the church doors, a cord had been strung in a long, shallow arc. Hung from it were perhaps two dozen tiny silver bells. There was hardly any breeze today, but enough so these small bells were never quite still... and if a real wind should rise, Roland thought, the sound made by the tintinnabulation of the bells would probably be a good deal less pleasant; more like the strident parley of gossips\" tongues.\\n\\n \"Hello!\" Roland called, looking across the street at what a large falsefronted sign proclaimed to be the Good Beds Hotel. \"Hello, the town!\"\\n\\n No answer but the bells, the tunesome insects, and that odd wooden clunking. No answer, no movement... but there were folk here. Folk or something. He was being watched. The tiny hairs on the nape of his neck had stiffened.\\n\\n Roland stepped onward, leading Topsy towards the centre of town, puffing up the unlaid High Street dust with each step. Forty paces further along, he stopped in front of a low building marked with a single curt word: LAW. The Sheriffs office (if they had such this far from the Inners) looked remarkably similar to the church-wooden boards stained a rather forbidding shade of dark brown above a stone foundation.\\n\\n The bells behind him rustled and whispered.\\n\\n He left the roan standing in the middle of the street and mounted the steps to the LAW office. He was very aware of the bells, the sun beating against his neck, and of the sweat trickling down his sides. The door was shut but unlocked. He opened it, then winced back, half-raising a hand as the heat trapped inside rushed out in a soundless gasp. If all the closed buildings were this hot inside, he mused, the livery barns would soon not be the only burned-out hulks. And with no rain to stop the flames (and certainly no volunteer fire department, not any more), the town would not be long for the face of the earth.\\n\\n He stepped inside, trying to sip at the stifling air rather than taking deep breaths. He immediately heard the low drone of flies.\\n\\n There was a single cell, commodious and empty, its barred door standing open. Filthy skin-shoes, one of the pair coming unsewn, lay beneath a bunk sodden with the same dried maroon stuff which had marked The Bustling Pig. Here was where the flies were, crawling over the stain, feeding from it.\\n\\n On the desk was a ledger. Roland turned it towards him and read what was embossed upon its red cover:\\n\\n REGISTRY OF MISDEEDS amp; REDRESS\\n\\n IN THE YEARS OF OUR LORD\\n\\n ELURIA\\n\\n So now he knew the name of the town, at least-Eluria. Pretty, yet somehow ominous, as well. But any name would have seemed ominous, Roland supposed, given these circumstances. He turned to leave, and saw a closed door secured by a wooden bolt.\\n\\n He went to it, stood before it for a moment, then drew one of the big revolvers he carried low on his hips. He stood a moment longer, head down, thinking (Cuthbert, his old friend, liked to say that the wheels inside Roland\u0027s head ground slow but exceedingly fine), and then retracted the bolt. He opened the door and immediately stood back, levelling his gun, expecting a body (Eluria\u0027s Sheriff, mayhap) to come tumbling into the room with his throat cut and his eyes gouged out, victim of a MISDEED in need of REDRESS\\n\\n Nothing.\\n\\n Well, half a dozen stained jumpers which longer-term prisoners probably required to wear, two bows, a quiver of arrows, an old, dusty motor, a rifle that had probably last been fired a hundred years agog and a mop... but in the gunslinger\u0027s mind, all that came down to nothing. Just a storage closet.\\n\\n He went back to the desk, opened the register, and leafed through it. Even the pages were warm, as if the book had been baked. In a way, he supposed it had been. If the High Street layout had been different, he might have expected a large number of religious offences to be recorded, but he wasn\u0027t surprised to find none here-if the Jesus-man church had coexisted with a couple of saloons, the churchfolk must have been fairly reasonable.\\n\\n What Roland found were the usual petty offences, and a few not so petty-a murder, a horse-thieving, the Distressal of a Lady (which probably meant rape). The murderer had been removed to a place called Lexingworth to be hanged. Roland had never heard of it. One note towards the end read Green folk sent hence. It meant nothing to Roland. The most recent entry was this: 12/Fe/99. Chas. Freeborn, cattle-theef to be tryed.\\n\\n Roland wasn\u0027t familiar with the notation 12/Fe/99, but as this was a long stretch from February, he supposed Fe might stand for Full Earth. In any case, the ink looked about as fresh as the blood on the bunk in the cell, and the gunslinger had a good idea that Chas. Freeborn, cattle-theef, had reached the clearing at the end of his path.\\n\\n He went out into the heat and the lacy sound of bells. Topsy looked at Roland dully, then lowered his head again, as if there were something in the dust of the High Street which could be cropped. As if he would ever want to crop again, for that matter.\\n\\n The gunslinger gathered up the reins, slapped the dust off them against the faded no-colour of his jeans, and continued on up the street. The wooden knocking sound grew steadily louder as he walked (he had not holstered his gun when leaving LAW, nor cared to holster it now), and as he neared the town square, which must have housed the Eluria market in more normal times, Roland at last saw movement.\\n\\n On the far side of the square was a long watering trough, made of iron-wood from the look (what some called \"seequoiah\" out here), apparently fed in happier times from a rusty steel pipe which now jutted waterless above the trough\u0027s south end. Lolling over one side of this municipal oasis, about halfway down its length, was a leg clad in faded grey pants and terminating in a well-chewed cowboy boot.\\n\\n The chewer was a large dog, perhaps two shades greyer than the corduroy pants. Under other circumstances, Roland supposed the mutt would have had the boot off long since, but perhaps the foot and lower calf inside it had swelled. In any case, the dog was well on its way to simply chewing the obstacle away. It would seize the boot and shake it back and forth. Every now and then the boot\u0027s heel would collide with the wooden side of the trough, producing another hollow knock. The gunslinger hadn\u0027t been so wrong to think of coffin tops after all, it seemed.\\n\\n Why doesn\u0027t it just back off a few steps, jump into the trough, and have at him? Roland wondered. No water coming out of the pipe, so it can\u0027t be afraid of drowning.\\n\\n Topsy uttered another of his hollow, tired sneezes, and when the dog lurched around in response, Roland understood why it was doing things the hard way. One of its front legs had been badly broken and crookedly mended. Walking would be a chore for it, jumping out of the question. On its chest was a patch of dirty white fur. Growing out of this patch was black fur in a roughly cruciform shape. A Jesus-dog, mayhap, hoping for a spot of afternoon communion.\\n\\n There was nothing very religious about the snarl which began to wind out of its chest, however, or the roll of its rheumy eyes. It lifted its upper lip in a trembling sneer, revealing a goodish set of teeth.\\n\\n \"Light out,\" Roland said. \"While you can.\"\\n\\n The dog backed up until its hindquarters were pressed against the chewed boot. It regarded the oncoming man fearfully, but clearly meant to stand its ground. The revolver in Roland\u0027s hand held no significance for it. The gunslinger wasn\u0027t surprised-he guessed the dog had never seen one, had no idea it was anything other than a club of some kind, which could only be thrown once.\\n\\n \"Hie on with you, now,\" Roland said, but still the dog wouldn\u0027t move.\\n\\n He should have shot it-it was no good to itself, and a dog that had acquired a taste for human flesh could be no good to anyone else-but he somehow didn\u0027t like to. Killing the only thing still living in this town (other than the singing bugs, that was) seemed like an invitation to bad luck.\\n\\n He fired into the dust near the dog\u0027s good forepaw, the sound crashing into the hot day and temporarily silencing the insects. The dog could run, it seemed, although at a lurching trot that hurt Roland\u0027s eyes... and his heart, a little, too. It stopped at the far side of the square, by an overturned flatbed wagon (there looked to be more dried blood splashed on the freighter\u0027s side), and glanced back. It uttered a forlorn howl that raised the hairs on the nape of Roland\u0027s neck even further.\\n\\n Then it turned, skirted the wrecked wagon, and limped down a lane which opened between two of the stalls. This way towards Eluria\u0027s back gate, Roland guessed.\\n\\n Still leading his dying horse, the gunslinger crossed the square to the ironwood trough and looked in.\\n\\n The owner of the chewed boot wasn\u0027t a man but a boy who had just been beginning to get his man\u0027s growth-and that would have been quite a large growth indeed, Roland judged, even setting aside the bloating effects which had resulted from being immersed for some unknown length of time in nine inches of water simmering under a summer sun.\\n\\n The boy\u0027s eyes, now just milky balls, stared blindly up at the gunslinger like the eyes of a statue. His hair appeared to be the white of old age, although that was the effect of the water; he had likely been a towhead. His clothes were those of a cowboy, although he couldn\u0027t have been much more than fourteen or sixteen. Around his neck, gleaming blearily in water that was slowly turning into a skin stew under the summer sun, was a gold medallion.\\n\\n Roland reached into the water, not liking to but feeling a certain obligation. He wrapped his fingers around the medallion and pulled. The chain parted, and he lifted the thing, dripping, into the air.\\n\\n He rather expected a Jesus-man sigil-what was called the crucifix or the rood -but a small rectangle hung from the chain, instead. The object looked like pure gold. Engraved into it was this legend:\\n\\n James\\n\\n Loved of Family, Loved of GOD\\n\\n Roland, who had been almost too revolted to reach into the polluted water (as a younger man, he could never have brought himself to that), was now glad he\u0027d done it. He might never run into any of those who had loved this boy, but he knew enough of ka to think it might be so. In any case, it was the right thing. So was giving the kid a decent burial... assuming, that was, he could get the body out of the trough without having it break apart inside the clothes.\\n\\n Roland was considering this, trying to balance what might be his duty in this circumstance against his growing desire to get out of this town, when Topsy finally fell dead.\\n\\n The roan went over with a creak of gear and a last whuffling groan as it hit the ground. Roland turned and saw eight people in the street, walking towards him in a line, like beaters who hope to flush out birds or drive small game. Their skin was waxy green. Folk wearing such skin would likely glow in the dark like ghosts. It was hard to tell their sex, and what could it matter-to them or anyone else? They were slow mutants, walking with the hunched deliberation of corpses reanimated by some arcane magic.\\n\\n The dust had muffled their feet like carpet. With the dog banished, they might well have gotten within attacking distance if Topsy hadn\u0027t done Roland the favour of dying at such an opportune moment. No guns that Roland could see; they were armed with clubs. These were chair-legs and table-legs, for the most part, but Roland saw one that looked made rather than seized-it had a bristle of rusty nails sticking out of it, and he suspected it had once-been the property of a saloon bouncer, possibly\\n\\n the one who kept school in The Bustling Pig.\\n\\n Roland raised his pistol, aiming at the fellow in the centre of the line. Now he could hear the shuffle of their feet, and the wet snuffle of their breathing. As if they all had bad chest-colds.\\n\\n Came out of the mines, most likely, Roland thought. There are radium mines somewhere about. That would account for the skin. I wonder that the sun doesn\u0027t kill them.\\n\\n Then, as he watched, the one on the end-a creature with a face like melted candle-wax-did die... or collapsed, at any rate. He (Roland was quite sure it was a male) went to his knees with a low, gobbling cry, groping for the hand of the thing walking next to him-something with a lumpy bald head and red sores sizzling on its neck. This creature took no notice of its fallen companion, but kept its dim eyes on Roland, lurching along in rough step with its remaining companions.\\n\\n \"Stop where you are!\" Roland said. \"Ware me, if you\u0027d live to see day\u0027s end! \"Ware me very well!\"\\n\\n He spoke mostly to the one in the centre, who wore ancient red suspenders over rags of shirt, and a filthy bowler hat. This gent had only one good eye, and it peered at the gunslinger with a greed as horrible as it was unmistakable. The one beside Bowler Hat (Roland believed this one might be a woman, with the dangling vestiges of breasts beneath the vest it wore) threw the chair-leg it held. The arc was true, but the missile fell ten yards short.\\n\\n Roland thumbed back the trigger of his revolver and fired again. This time the dirt displaced by the slug kicked up on the tattered remains of Bowler Hat\u0027s shoe instead of on a lame dog\u0027s paw.\\n\\n The green folk didn\u0027t run as the dog had, but they stopped, staring at him with their dull greed. Had the missing folk of Eluria finished up in these creatures\" stomachs? Roland couldn\u0027t believe it... although he knew perfectly well that such as these held no scruple against cannibalism. (And perhaps it wasn\u0027t cannibalism, not really; how could such things as these be considered human, whatever they might once have been?) They were too slow, too stupid. If they had dared come back into town after the Sheriff had run them out, they would have been burned or stoned to death.\\n\\n Without thinking about what he was doing, wanting only to free his other hand to draw his second gun if the apparitions didn\u0027t see reason, Roland stuffed the medallion which he had taken from the dead boy into the pocket of his jeans, pushing the broken fine-link chain in after.\\n\\n They stood staring at him, their strangely twisted shadows drawn out behind them. What next? Tell them to go back where they\u0027d come from? Roland didn\u0027t know if they\u0027d do it, and in any case had decided he liked them best where he could see them. And at least there was no question now about staying to bury the boy named James; that conundrum had been solved.\\n\\n \"Stand steady,\" he said in the low speech, beginning to retreat. \"First fellow that moves-\"\\n\\n Before he could finish, one of them-a thick-chested troll with a pouty toad\u0027s mouth and what looked like gills on the sides of his wattled neck-lunged forward, gibbering in a high-pitched and peculiarly flabby voice.\\n\\n It might have been a species of laughter. He was waving what looked like a piano-leg.\\n\\n Roland fired. Mr Toad\u0027s chest caved in like a bad piece of roofing. He ran backwards several steps, trying to catch his balance and clawing at his chest with the hand not holding the piano-leg. His feet, clad in dirty red velvet slippers with curled-up toes, tangled in each other and he fell over, making a queer and somehow lonely gargling sound. He let go of his club, rolled over on one side, tried to rise, and then fell back into the dust. The brutal sun glared into his open eyes, and as Roland watched, white tendrils of steam began to rise from his skin, which was rapidly losing its green undertint. There was also a hissing sound, like a gob of spit on top of a hot stove.\\n\\n Saves explaining, at least, Roland thought, and swept his eyes over the others. \"All right; he was the first one to move. Who wants to be the second?\"\\n\\n None did, it seemed. They only stood there, watching him, not coming at him... but not retreating, either. He thought (as he had about the crucifix-dog) that he should kill them as they stood there, just draw his other gun and mow them down. It would be the work of seconds only, and child\u0027s play to his gifted hands, even if some ran. But he couldn\u0027t.\\n\\n Not just cold, like that. He wasn\u0027t that kind of killer... at least, not yet.\\n\\n Very slowly, he began to step backwards, first bending his course around the watering trough, then putting it between him and them. When Bowler Hat took a step forward, Roland didn\u0027t give the others in the line a chance to copy him; he put a bullet into the dust of High Street an inch in advance of Bowler Hat\u0027s foot.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s your last warning,\" he said, still using the low speech. He had no idea if they understood it, didn\u0027t really care. He guessed they caught this tune\u0027s music well enough. \"Next bullet I fire eats up someone\u0027s heart. The way it works is, you stay and I go. You get this one chance. Follow me, and you all die. It\u0027s too hot to play games and I\u0027ve lost my-\"\\n\\n \"Booh!\" cried a rough, liquidy voice from behind him. There was unmistakable glee in it. Roland saw a shadow grow from the shadow of the overturned freight wagon, which he had now almost reached, and had just time to understand that another of the green folk had been hiding beneath it.\\n\\n As he began to turn, a club crashed down on Roland\u0027s shoulder, numbing his right arm all the way to the wrist. He held on to the gun and fired once, but the bullet went into one of the wagon-wheels, smashing a wooden spoke and turning the wheel on its hub with a high screeching sound. Behind him, he heard the green folk in the street uttering hoarse, yapping cries as they charged forward.\\n\\n The thing which had been hiding beneath the overturned wagon was a monster with two heads growing out of his neck, one with the vestigial, slack face of a corpse. The other, although just as green, was more lively. Broad lips spread in a cheerful grin as he raised his club to strike again.\\n\\n Roland drew with his left hand-the one that wasn\u0027t numbed and distant. He had time to put one bullet through the bushwhacker\u0027s grin, flinging him backwards in a spray of blood and teeth, the bludgeon flying out of his relaxing fingers. Then the others were on him, clubbing and drubbing.\\n\\n The gunslinger was able to slip the first couple of blows, and there was one moment when he thought he might be able to spin around to the rear of the overturned wagon, spin and turn and go to work with his guns. Surely he would be able to do that. Surely his quest for the Dark Tower wasn\u0027t supposed to end on the sun-blasted street of a little far-western town called Eluria, at the hands of half a dozen green-skinned slow mutants. Surely ka could not be so cruel.\\n\\n But Bowler Hat caught him with a vicious sidehand blow, and Roland crashed into the wagon\u0027s slowly spinning rear wheel instead of skirting around it. As he went to his hands and knees, still scrambling and trying to turn, trying to evade the blows which rained down on him, he saw there were now many more than half a dozen. Coming up the street towards the town square were at least thirty green men and women. This wasn\u0027t a clan but a damned tribe of them. And in broad, hot daylight! Slow mutants were, in his experience, creatures that loved the dark, almost like toadstools with brains, and he had never seen any such as these before. They -\\n\\n The one in the red vest was female. Her bare breasts swinging beneath the dirty red vest were the last things he saw clearly as they gathered around and above him, bashing away with their clubs. The one with the nails studded in it came down on his lower right calf, sinking its stupid rusty fangs in deep. He tried again to raise one of the big guns (his vision was fading, now, but that wouldn\u0027t help them if he got to shooting; he had always been the most hellishly talented of them; Jamie DeCurry had once proclaimed that Roland could shoot blindfolded, because he had eyes in his fingers), and it was kicked out of his hand and into the dust. Although he could still feel the smooth sandalwood grip of the other, he thought it was nevertheless already gone.\\n\\n He could smell them-the rich, rotted smell of decaying meat. Or was that only his hands, as he raised them in a feeble and useless effort to protect his head? His hands, which had been in the polluted water where flecks and strips of the dead boy\u0027s skin floated?\\n\\n The clubs slamming down on him, slamming down all over him, as if the green folk wanted not just to beat him to death but to tenderize him as they did so. And as he went down into the darkness of what he most certainly believed would be his death, he heard the bugs singing, the dog he had spared barking, and the bells hung on the church door ringing. These sounds merged together into strangely sweet music. Then that was gone, too; the darkness ate it all. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-little-sisters-of-eluria-the-dark-tower-0-5/page-1.html","bookId":2575,"book":{"id":2575,"title":"The Little Sisters of Eluria (The Dark Tower #0.5)","description":"Storyline: The Little Sisters of Eluria (Stephen King\u0027s The Dark Tower - Graphic Novel series #7) \\n Near death from an attack by Slow Mutants, Roland Deschain is taken in by a group of Sisters who specialize in anything but the healing arts.
