{"id":93565,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"The gunslinger\u0027s return to the world wasn\u0027t like coming back to consciousness after a blow, which he\u0027d done several times before, and it wasn\u0027t like waking from sleep, either. It was like rising.\n I\u0027m dead, he thought at some point during this process... when the power to think had been at least partially restored to him. Dead and rising into whatever afterlife there is. That\u0027s what it must be. The singing I hear is the singing of dead souls.\n Total blackness gave way to the dark grey of rainclouds, then to the lighter grey of fog. This brightened to the uniform clarity of a heavy mist moments before the sun breaks through. And through it all was that sense of rising, as if he had been caught in some mild but powerful updraught.\n As the sense of rising began to diminish and the brightness behind his eyelids grew, Roland at last began to believe he was still alive. It was the singing that convinced him. Not dead souls, not the heavenly host of angels sometimes described by the Jesus-man preachers, but only those bugs. A little like crickets, but sweeter-voiced. The ones he had heard in Eluria.\n On this thought, he opened his eyes.\n His belief that he was still alive was severely tried, for Roland found himself hanging suspended in a world of white beauty-his first bewildered thought was that he was in the sky, floating within a fair-weather cloud. All around him was the reedy singing of the bugs. Now he could hear the tinkling of bells, too.\n He tried to turn his head and swayed in some sort of harness. He could hear it creaking. The soft singing of the bugs, like crickets in the grass at the end of day back home in Gilead, hesitated and broke rhythm. When it did, what felt like a tree of pain grew up Roland\u0027s back. He had no idea what its burning branches might be, but the trunk was surely his spine. A far deadlier pain sank into one of his lower legs ~ in his confusion, the gunslinger could not tell which one. That\u0027s where the club with the nails in it got me, he thought. And more pain in his head. His skull felt like a badly cracked egg. He cried out, and could hardly believe that the harsh crow\u0027s caw he heard came from his own throat. He thought he could also hear, very faintly, the barking of the cross-dog, but surely that was his imagination.\n Am I dying? Have I awakened once more at the very end?\n A hand stroked his brow. He could feel it but not see it-fingers trailing across his skin pausing here and there to massage a knot or a line. Delicious, like a drink of cool water on a hot day. He began to close his eyes, and then a horrible idea came to him: suppose that hand were green, its owner wearing a tattered red vest over her hanging dugs?\n What if it is? What could you do?\n \"Hush, man,\" a young woman\u0027s voice said... or perhaps it was the voice of a girl. Certainly the first person Roland thought of was Susan, the girl from Mejis, she who had spoken to him as thee.\n \"Where... where...\"\n \"Hush, stir not. \"Tis far too soon.\"\n The pain in his back was subsiding now, but the image of the pain as a tree remained, for his very skin seemed to be moving like leaves in a light breeze. How could that be?\n He let the question go-let all questions go-and concentrated on the small, cool hand stroking his brow.\n \"Hush, pretty man, God\u0027s love be upon ye. Yet it\u0027s sore hurt ye are. Be still. Heal.\"\n The dog had hushed its barking (if it had ever been there in the first place), and Roland became aware of that low, creaking sound again. It reminded him of horse-tethers, or something-hangropes-he didn\u0027t like to think of. Now he believed he could feel pressure beneath his thighs, his buttocks, and perhaps... yes... his shoulders.\n I\u0027m not in a bed at all. I think I\u0027m above a bed. Can that be?\n He supposed he could be in a sling. He seemed to remember once, as a boy, that some fellow had been suspended that way in the horse-doctor\u0027s room behind the Great Hall. A stablehand who had been burned too badly by kerosene to be laid in a bed. The man had died, but not soon enough; for two nights, his shrieks had filled the sweet summer air of the Gathering Fields.\n Am I burned, then, nothing but a cinder with legs, hanging in a sling?\n The fingers touched the centre of his brow, rubbing away the frown forming there. And it was as if the voice which went with the hand had read his thoughts, picking them up with the tips of her clever, soothing fingers.\n \"Ye\u0027ll be fine if God wills, sai,\" the voice which went with the hand said. \"But time belongs to God, not to you.\"\n No, he would have said, if he had been able. Time belongs to the Tower.\n Then he slipped down again, descending as smoothly as he had risen, going away from the hand and the dreamlike sounds of the singing insects and chiming bells. There was an interval that might have been sleep, or perhaps unconsciousness, but he never went all the way back down.\n At one point he thought he heard the girl\u0027s voice, although he couldn\u0027t be sure, because this time it was raised in fury, or fear, or both. \"No!\" she cried. \"Ye can\u0027t have it off him and ye know it! Go your course and stop talking of it, do!\"\n When he rose back to consciousness the second time, he was no stronger in body, but a little more himself in mind. What he saw when he opened his eyes wasn\u0027t the inside of a cloud, but at first that same phrase-white beauty-recurred to him. It was in some ways the most beautiful place Roland had ever been in his life... partially because he still had a life, of course, but mostly because it was so fey and peaceful.\n It was a huge room, high and long. When Roland at last turned his head-cautiously, so cautiously-to take its measure as well as he could, he thought it must run at least two hundred yards from end to end. It was built narrow, but its height gave the place a feeling of tremendous airiness.\n There were no walls or ceilings such as those he was familiar with, although it was a little like being in a vast tent. Above him, the sun struck and diffused its light across billowy panels of thin white silk, turning them into the bright swags which he had first mistaken for clouds. Beneath this silk canopy, the room was as grey as twilight. The walls, also silk, rippled like sails in a faint breeze. Hanging from each wall-panel was a curved rope bearing small bells. These lay against the fabric and rang in low and charming unison, like wind-chimes, when the walls rippled.\n An aisle ran down the centre of the long room; on either side of it were scores of beds, each made up with clean white sheets and headed with crisp white pillows. There were perhaps forty on the far side of the aisle, all empty, and another forty on Roland\u0027s side. There were two other occupied beds here, one next to Roland on his left. This fellow-It\u0027s the boy. The one who was in the trough.\n The idea ran goosebumps up Roland\u0027s arms and gave him a nasty, superstitious start. He peered more closely at the sleeping boy.\n Can\u0027t be. You\u0027re just dazed, that\u0027s all; it can\u0027t be.\n Yet closer scrutiny refused to dispel the idea. It certainly seemed to be the boy from the trough, probably ill (why else would he be in a place like this?) but far from dead; Roland could see the slow rise and fall of his chest, and the occasional twitch of the fingers which dangled over the side of the bed.\n You didn\u0027t get a good enough look at him to be sure of anything, and after a few days in that trough, his own mother couldn\u0027t have said for sure who it was.\n But Roland, who\u0027d had a mother, knew better than that. He also knew that he\u0027d seen the gold medallion around the boy\u0027s neck. just before the attack of the green folk, he had taken it from this lad\u0027s corpse and put it in his pocket. Now someone-the proprietors of this place, most likely, they who had sorcerously restored the lad named James to his interrupted life-had taken it back from Roland and put it around the boy\u0027s neck again.\n Had the girl with the wonderfully cool hand done that? Did she in consequence think Roland a ghoul who would steal from the dead? He didn\u0027t like to think so. In fact, the notion made him more uncomfortable than the idea that the young cowboy\u0027s bloated body had been somehow returned to its normal size and then reanimated.\n Further down the aisle on this side, perhaps a dozen empty beds away from the boy and Roland Deschain, the gunslinger saw a third inmate of this queer infirmary. This fellow looked at least four times the age of the lad, twice the age of the gunslinger. He had a long beard, more grey than black, that hung to his upper chest in two straggly forks. The face above it was sun-darkened, heavily lined, and pouched beneath the eyes. Running from his left cheek and across the bridge of his nose was a thick dark mark which Roland took to be a scar. The bearded man was either asleep or unconscious-Roland could hear him snoring-and was suspended three feet above his bed, held up by a complex series of white belts that glimmered in the dim air. These crisscrossed each other, making a series of figure eights all the way around the man\u0027s body. He looked like a bug in some exotic spider\u0027s web. He wore a gauzy white bed-dress. One of the belts ran beneath his buttocks, elevating his crotch in a way that seemed to offer the bulge of his privates to the grey and dreaming air. Further down his body, Roland could see the dark shadow-shapes of his legs. They appeared to be twisted like ancient dead trees. Roland didn\u0027t like to think in how many places they must have been broken to look like that. And yet they appeared to be moving. How could they be, if the bearded man was unconscious? It was a trick of the light, perhaps, or of the shadows... perhaps the gauzy singlet the man was wearing was stirring in a light breeze, or...\n Roland looked away, up at the billowy silk panels high above, trying to control the accelerating beat of his heart. What he saw hadn\u0027t been caused by the wind, or a shadow, or anything else. The man\u0027s legs were somehow moving without moving... as Roland had seemed to feel his own back moving without moving. He didn\u0027t know what could cause such a phenomenon, and didn\u0027t want to know, at least not yet.\n \"I\u0027m not ready,\" he whispered. His lips felt very dry. He closed his eyes again, wanting to sleep, wanting not to think about what the bearded man\u0027s twisted legs might indicate about his own condition. But -\n But you\u0027d better get ready.\n That was the voice that always seemed to come when he tried to slack off, to scamp a job, or take the easy way around an obstacle. It was the voice of Cort, his old teacher. The man whose stick they had all feared, as boys. They hadn\u0027t feared his stick as much as his mouth, however. His jeers when they were weak, his contempt when they complained or tried whining about their lot.\n Are you a gunslinger, Roland? If you are, you better get ready.\n Roland opened his eyes again and turned his head to the left again. As he did, he felt something shift against his chest.\n Moving very slowly, he raised his right hand out of the sling that held it. The pain in his back stirred and muttered. He stopped moving until he decided the pain was going to get no worse (if he was careful, at least), then lifted the hand the rest of the way to his chest. It encountered finely-woven cloth. Cotton. He lowered his chin to his breastbone and saw he was wearing a bed-dress like the one draped on the body of the bearded man.\n Roland reached beneath the neck of the gown and felt a fine chain. A little further down, his fingers encountered a rectangular metal shape. He thought he knew what it was, but had to be sure. He pulled it out, still moving with great care, trying not to engage any of the muscles in his back. A gold medallion. He dared the pain, lifting it until he could read what was engraved upon it:\n James\n Loved of family, Loved of GOD\n He tucked it into the top of the bed-dress again and looked back at the sleeping boy in the next bed-in it, not suspended over it. The sheet was only pulled up to the boy\u0027s ribcage, and the medallion lay on the pristine white breast of his bed-dress. The same medallion Roland now wore. Except...\n Roland thought he understood, and understanding was a relief.\n He looked back at the bearded man, and saw an exceedingly strange thing: the thick black line of scar across the bearded man\u0027s cheek and nose was gone. Where it had been was the pinkish-red mark of a healing wound... a cut, or perhaps a slash.\n I imagined it.\n No, gunslinger, Cort\u0027s voice returned. Such as you was not made to imagine. As you well know.\n The little bit of movement had tired him out again... or perhaps it was the thinking which had really tired him out. The singing bugs and chiming bells combined and made something too much like a lullaby to resist. This time when Roland closed his eyes, he slept. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-little-sisters-of-eluria-the-dark-tower-0-5/page-2.html","bookId":2575,"book":{"id":2575,"title":"The Little Sisters of Eluria (The Dark Tower #0.5)","description":"Storyline: \n The Little Sisters of Eluria (Stephen King\u0027s The Dark Tower - Graphic Novel series #7) \n Near death from an attack by Slow Mutants, Roland Deschain is taken in by a group of Sisters who specialize in anything but the healing arts.
