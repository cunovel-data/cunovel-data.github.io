{"id":93569,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"That was one of the longest days of Roland\u0027s life. He dozed, but never deeply; the reeds were doing their work, and he had begun to believe that he might, with Jenna\u0027s help, actually get out of here. And there was the matter of his guns, as well-perhaps she might be able to help there, too.\\n\\n He passed the slow hours thinking of old times-of Gilead and his friends, of the riddling he had almost won at one Wide Earth Fair. In the end another had taken the goose, but he\u0027d had his chance, aye. He thought of his mother and father; he thought of Abel Vannay, who had limped his way through a life of gentle goodness, and Eldred Jonas, who had limped his way through a life of evil... until Roland had blown him loose of his saddle, one fine desert day.\\n\\n He thought, as always, of Susan.\\n\\n If you love me, then love me, she\u0027d said... and so he had.\\n\\n So he had.\\n\\n In this way the time passed. At rough hourly intervals, he took one of the reeds from beneath his pillow and nibbled it. Now his muscles didn\u0027t tremble so badly as the stuff passed into his system, nor his heart pound so fiercely. The medicine in the reeds no longer had to battle the Sisters\" medicine so fiercely, Roland thought; the reeds were winning.\\n\\n The diffused brightness of the sun moved across the white silk ceiling of the ward, and at last the dimness which always seemed to hover at bed-level began to rise. The long room\u0027s western wall bloomed with the rose-melting-to-orange shades of sunset.\\n\\n It was Sister Tamra who brought him his dinner that night-soup and another popkin. She also laid a desert lily beside his hand. She smiled she did it. Her cheeks were bright with colour. All of them were bright with colour today, like leeches which had gorged until they were almost to bursting.\\n\\n \"From your admirer, Jimmy,\" she said. \"She\u0027s so sweet on ye! The I means \"Do not forget my promise\". What has she promised ye, Jimmy brother of Johnny?\"\\n\\n \"That she\u0027d see me again, and we\u0027d talk.\"\\n\\n Tamra laughed so hard that the bells lining her forehead jingled. She clasped her hands together in a perfect ecstasy of glee. \"Sweet as honey\\n\\n Oh, yes!\" She bent her smiling gaze on Roland. \"It\u0027s sad such a promise can never be kept. Ye\u0027ll never see her again, pretty man. \" She took the bowl. \"Big Sister has decided. \" She stood up, still smiling. \"Why not take that ugly gold sigil off?\"\\n\\n \"I think not.\"\\n\\n \"Yer brother took his off-look!\" She pointed, and Roland spied the gold medallion lying far down the aisle, where it had landed when Ralph threw it.\\n\\n Sister Tamra looked at him, still smiling.\\n\\n \"He decided it was part of what was making him sick, and cast it away Ye\u0027d do the same, were ye wise.\"\\n\\n Roland repeated: \"I think not.\"\\n\\n \"So,\" she said dismissively, and left him alone with the empty beds glimmering in the thickening shadows.\\n\\n Roland hung on, in spite of growing sleepiness, until the hot colours bleeding across the infirmary\u0027s western wall had cooled to ashes. Then he nibbled one of the reeds and felt strength-real strength, not a jittery, heart-thudding substitute -bloom in his body. He looked towards where the castaway medallion gleamed in the last light and made a silent promise to John Norman: he would take it with the other one to Norman\u0027s kin, if ka chanced that he should encounter them in his travels.\\n\\n Feeling completely easy in his mind for the first time that day, the gunslinger dozed. When he awoke it was full dark. The doctor-bugs were singing with extraordinary shrillness. He had taken one of the reeds out from under the pillow and had begun to nibble on it when a cold voice said, \"So-Big Sister was right. Ye\u0027ve been keeping secrets.\"\\n\\n Roland\u0027s heart seemed to stop dead in his chest. He looked around and saw Sister Coquina getting to her feet. She had crept in while he was dozing and hidden under the bed on his right side to watch him. \"Where did ye get that?\" she asked. \"Was it \"He got it from me.\"\\n\\n Coquina whirled about. Jenna was walking down the aisle towards them. Her habit was gone. She still wore her wimple with its foreheadfringe of bells, but its hem rested on the shoulders of a simple checkered shirt. Below this she wore jeans and scuffed desert boots. She had something in her hands. It was too dark for Roland to be sure, but he thought\\n\\n YOU,\" Sister Coquina whispered with infinite hate. \"When I tell Big Sister -\\n\\n \"you\u0027ll tell no one anything,\" Roland said.\\n\\n If he had planned his escape from the slings which entangled him, he no doubt would have made a bad business of it, but, as always, the gunslinger did best when he thought least. His arms were free in a moment; so was his left leg. His right caught at the ankle, however, twisting, hanging him up with his shoulders on the bed and his leg in the air.\\n\\n Coquina turned on him, hissing like a cat. Her lips pulled back from teeth that were needle-sharp. She rushed at him, her fingers splayed. The nails at the ends of them looked sharp and ragged.\\n\\n Roland clasped the medallion and shoved it out towards her. She recoiled from it, still hissing, and whirled back to Sister Jenna in a flare of white skirt. \"I\u0027ll do for ye, ye interfering trull!\" she cried in a low, harsh voice.\\n\\n Roland struggled to free his leg and couldn\u0027t. It was firmly caught, the shitting sling actually wrapped around the ankle somehow, like a noose.\\n\\n Jenna raised her hands, and he saw he had been right: it was his revolvers she had brought, holstered and hanging from the two old gunbelts he had worn out of Gilead after the last burning.\\n\\n \"Shoot her, Jenna! Shoot her!\"\\n\\n Instead, still holding the holstered guns up, Jenna shook her head as she had on the day when Roland had persuaded her to push back her wimple so he could see her hair. The bells rang with a sharpness that seemed to go into the gunslinger\u0027s head like a spike.\\n\\n The Dark Bells. The sigil of their ka-tet. What -\\n\\n The sound of the doctor-bugs rose to a shrill, reedy scream that was eerily like the sound of the bells Jenna wore. Nothing sweet about them now. Sister Coquina\u0027s hands faltered on their way to Jenna\u0027s throat; Jenna herself had not so much as flinched or blinked her eyes.\\n\\n \"No,\" Coquina whispered. \"You can\u0027t!\"\\n\\n \"I have,\" Jenna said, and Roland saw the bugs. Descending from the legs of the bearded man, he\u0027d observed a battalion. What he saw coming from the shadows now was an army to end all armies; had they been men instead of insects, there might have been more than all the men who had ever carried arms in the long and bloody history of World.\\n\\n Yet the sight of them advancing down the boards of the aisle was what Roland would always remember, nor what would haunt his dream for a year or more; it was the way they coated the beds. These were turning black two by two on both sides of the aisle, like pairs of dim rectangular lights going out.\\n\\n Coquina shrieked and began to shake her own head, to ring her bells. The sound they made was thin and pointless compared to the sharp ringing of the Dark Bells.\\n\\n Still the bugs marched on, darkening the floor, blacking out the be\\n\\n Jenna darted past the shrieking Sister Coquina, dropped Roland\u0027s beside him, then yanked the twisted sling straight with one hard p Roland slid his leg free.\\n\\n \"Come,\" she said. \"I\u0027ve started them, but staying them could be a different thing.\"\\n\\n Now Sister Coquina\u0027s shrieks were not of horror but of pain. The bugs had found her.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t look,\" Jenna said, helping Roland to his feet. He thought that never in his life had he been so glad to be upon them. \"Come. We mu be quick-she\u0027ll rouse the others. I\u0027ve put your boots and clothes aside the path that leads away from here-I carried as much as I could. How ye? Are ye strong?\"\\n\\n \"Thanks to you. \" How long he would stay strong Roland didn\u0027t know... and right now it wasn\u0027t a question that mattered. He saw Jenna snatch up two of the reeds-in his struggle to escape the slings, they had scattered all over the head of the bed-and then they were hurrying up the aisle, away from the bugs and from Sister Coquina, whose cries were now failing.\\n\\n Roland buckled on his guns and tied them down without breaking stride.\\n\\n They passed only three beds on each side before reaching the flap of the tent... and it was a tent, he saw, not a vast pavilion. The silk walls and ceiling were fraying canvas, thin enough to let in the light of a threequarters Kissing Moon. And the beds weren\u0027t beds at all, but only a double row of shabby cots.\\n\\n He turned and saw a black, writhing hump on the floor where Sister Coquina had been. At the sight of her, Roland was struck by an unpleasant thought.\\n\\n \"I forgot John Norman\u0027s medallion!\" A keen sense of regret-almost of mourning-went through him like wind.\\n\\n Jenna reached into the pocket of her jeans and brought it out. It glimmered in the moonlight.\\n\\n \"I picked it up off the floor.\"\\n\\n He didn\u0027t know which made him gladder-the sight of the medallion or the sight of it in her hand. It meant she wasn\u0027t like the others.\\n\\n Then, as if to dispel that notion before it got too firm a hold on him, she said: \"Take it, Roland-I can hold it no more. \" And, as he took it, he saw unmistakable marks of charring on her fingers.\\n\\n He took her hand and kissed each burn.\\n\\n \"Thankee-sai,\" she said, and he saw she was crying. \"Thankee, dear. To be kissed so is lovely, worth every pain. Now...\"\\n\\n Roland saw her eyes shift, and followed them. Here were bobbing lights descending a rocky path. Beyond them he saw the building where the Little Sisters had been living-not a convent but a ruined hacienda that looked a thousand years old. There were three candles; as they drew closer, Roland saw that there were only three sisters. Mary wasn\u0027t among them.\\n\\n He drew his guns.\\n\\n \"Oooo, it\u0027s a gunslinger-man he is!\" Louise.\\n\\n \"A scary man!\" Michela.\\n\\n \"And he\u0027s found his ladylove as well as his shooters!\" Tamra.\\n\\n \"His slut-whore!\" Louise.\\n\\n Laughing angrily. Not afraid... at least, not of his weapons.\\n\\n \"Put them away,\" Jenna told him, and when she looked, saw that he already had.\\n\\n The others, meanwhile, had drawn closer.\\n\\n \"Ooo, see, she cries!\" Tamra.\\n\\n \"Doffed her habit, she has!\" Michela. \"Perhaps it\u0027s her broken vows she cries for.\"\\n\\n \"Why such tears, pretty?\" Louise.\\n\\n \"Because he kissed my fingers where they were burned,\" Jenna said. \"I\u0027ve never been kissed before. It made me cry.\"\\n\\n \"Ooooo!\"\\n\\n \"Luv-ly!\"\\n\\n \"Next he\u0027ll stick his thing in her! Even luv-lier!\"\\n\\n Jenna bore their japes with no sign of anger. When they were done, she said: \"I\u0027m going with him. Stand aside.\"\\n\\n They gaped at her, counterfeit laughter disappearing in shock.\\n\\n \"No!\" Louise whispered. \"Are ye mad? Ye know what\u0027ll happen!\"\\n\\n \"No, and neither do you,\" Jenna said. \"Besides, I care not. \" She half-turned and held her hand out to the mouth of the ancient hospital tent. It was a faded olive-drab in the moonlight, with an old red cross drawn on its roof.\\n\\n Roland wondered how many towns the Sisters had been to With this tent which was so small and plain on the outside, so huge and gloriously on the inside. How many towns and over how many years.\\n\\n Now, cramming the mouth of it in a black, shiny tongue, were doctor-bugs. They had stopped their singing. Their silence was somehow terrible.\\n\\n \"Stand aside or I\u0027ll have them on ye,\" Jenna said.\\n\\n \"Ye never would!\" Sister Michela cried in a low, horrified voice.\\n\\n \"Aye. I\u0027ve already set them on Sister Coquina. She\u0027s a part of the medicine, now.\"\\n\\n Their gasp was like cold wind passing through dead trees. Nor was all that dismay directed towards their own precious hides. What Jenna h done was clearly far outside their reckoning.\\n\\n \"Then you\u0027re damned,\" Sister Tamra said.\\n\\n \"Such ones to speak of damnation! Stand aside.\"\\n\\n They did. Roland walked past them and they shrank away from him. but they shrank from her more.\\n\\n \"Damned?\" he asked after they had skirted the haci and reached the path beyond it. The Kissing Moon glimmered above a tumbled scree of rocks In its light Roland could see a small black opening low on the scarp. guessed it was the cave the Sisters called Thoughtful House. \"What did they mean, damned?\"\\n\\n \"Never mind. All we have to worry about now is Sister Mary. I like not that we haven\u0027t seen her.\"\\n\\n She tried to walk faster, but he grasped her arm and turned her about. He could still hear the singing of the bugs, but faintly; they were leaving the place of the Sisters behind. Eluria, too, if the compass in his head was still working; he thought the town was in the other direction. The husk of the town, he amended.\\n\\n \"Tell me what they meant.\"\\n\\n \"Perhaps nothing. Ask me not, Roland-what good is it? \"Tis done, the bridge burned. I can\u0027t go back. Nor would if I could. \" She looked down, biting her lip, and when she looked up again, Roland saw fresh tears falling on her cheeks. \"I have supped with them. There were times when I couldn\u0027t help it, no more than you could help drinking their wretched soup, no matter if you knew what was in it.\"\\n\\n Roland remembered John Norman saying A man has to eat... a woman, too. He nodded.\\n\\n \"I\u0027d go no further down that road. If there\u0027s to be damnation, let it be of my choosing, not theirs. My mother meant well by bringing me back to them, but she was wrong. \" She looked at him shyly and fearfully... but met his eyes. \"I\u0027d go beside ye on yer road, Roland of Gilead. For as long as I may, or as long as ye\u0027d have me.\"\\n\\n \"you\u0027re welcome to your share of my way,\" he said. \"And I am-\"\\n\\n Blessed by your company, he would have finished, but before he could, a voice spoke from the tangle of moonshadow ahead of them, where the path at last climbed out of the rocky, sterile valley in which the Little Sisters had practised their glamours.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a sad duty to stop such a pretty elopement, but stop it I must.\"\\n\\n Sister Mary came from the shadows. Her fine white habit with its bright red rose had reverted to what it really was: the shroud of a corpse. Caught, hooded in its grimy folds, was a wrinkled, sagging face from which two black eyes stared. They looked like rotted dates. Below them, exposed by the thing\u0027s smile, four great incisors gleamed.\\n\\n Upon the stretched skin of Sister Mary\u0027s forehead, bells tinkled... but not the Dark Bells, Roland thought. There was that.\\n\\n \"Stand clear,\" Jenna said. \"Or I\u0027ll bring the can tam on ye.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Sister Mary said, stepping closer, \"ye won\u0027t. They\u0027ll not stray so far from the others. Shake your head and ring those damned bells until the clappers fall out, and still they\u0027ll never come.\"\\n\\n Jenna did as bid, shaking her head furiously from side to side. The Dark Bells rang piercingly, but without that extra, almost psychic tone-quality that had gone through Roland\u0027s head like a spike. And the doctor-bugs\\n\\n what Jenna had called the can tam-did not come.\\n\\n Smiling ever more broadly (Roland had an idea Mary herself hadn\u0027t been completely sure they wouldn\u0027t come until the experiment was made), the corpse-woman closed in on them, seeming to float above the ground. Her eyes flicked towards him. \"And put that away,\" she said.\\n\\n Roland looked down and saw that one of his guns was in his hand. He had no memory of drawing it.\\n\\n \"Unless it\u0027s been blessed or dipped in some sect\u0027s holy wet-blood, water, semen-it can\u0027t harm such as I, gunslinger. For I am more shade than substance... yet still the equal to such as yerself, for all that.\"\\n\\n She thought he would try shooting her, anyway; he saw it in her eyes. Those shooters are all ye have, her eyes said. Without \"em, you might as well be back in the tent we dreamed around ye, caught up in our slings and awaiting our pleasure.\\n\\n Instead of shooting, he dropped the revolver back into its holster and launched himself at her with his hands out. Sister Mary uttered a scream that was mostly surprise, but it was not a long one; Roland\u0027s fingers clamped down on her throat and choked the sound off before it was fairly started.\\n\\n The touch of her flesh was obscene-it seemed not just alive but various beneath his hands, as if it was trying to crawl away from him. He could feel it running like liquid, flowing, and the sensation was horrible beyond description. Yet he clamped down harder, determined to choke the I out of her.\\n\\n Then there came a blue flash (not in the air, he would think later; that flash happened inside his head, a single stroke of lightning as she touch off some brief but powerful brainstorm), and his hands flew away from h neck. For one moment his dazzled eyes saw great wet gouges in her flesh-gouges in the shapes of his hands. Then he was flung backwards hitting the scree on his back and sliding, striking his head on a jutting rock hard enough to provoke a second, lesser, flash of light.\\n\\n \"Nay, my pretty man,\" she said, grimacing at him, laughing with those terrible dull eyes of hers. \"Ye don\u0027t choke such as I, and I\u0027ll take ye slow yer impertinence-cut ye shallow in a hundred places to refresh my thirst First, though, I\u0027ll have this vowless girl... and I\u0027ll have those damned bells off her, in the bargain.\"\\n\\n \"Come and see if you can!\" Jenna cried in a trembling voice, and shook her head from side to side. The Dark Bells rang mockingly, provokingly\\n\\n Mary\u0027s grimace of a smile fell away. \"Oh, I can,\" she breathed. Her mouth yawned. In the moonlight, her fangs gleamed in her gums like bone needles poked through a red pillow. \"I can and I-\"\\n\\n There was a growl from above them. It rose, then splintered into a volley of snarling barks. Mary turned to her left, and in the moment before the snarling thing left the rock on which it was standing, Roland could clearly read the startled bewilderment on Big Sister\u0027s face.\\n\\n It launched itself at her, only a dark shape against the stars, legs outstretched so it looked like some sort of weird bat, but even before it crashed into the woman, striking her in the chest above her half-raise arms and fastening its own teeth on her throat, Roland knew exactly what it was.\\n\\n As the shape bore her over on to her back, Sister Mary uttered a gibbering shriek that went through Roland\u0027s head like the Dark Bells themselves. He scrambled to his feet, gasping. The shadowy thing tore at her, forepaws on either side of her head, rear paws planted on the grave-shroud above her, chest, where the rose had been.\\n\\n Roland grabbed Jenna, who was looking down at the fallen Sister with a kind of frozen fascination.\\n\\n \"Come on!\" he shouted. \"Before it decides it wants a bite of you, too!\"\\n\\n The dog took no notice of them as Roland pulled Jenna past. It had torn\\n\\n Sister Mary\u0027s head mostly off. Her flesh seemed to be changing, somehow-decomposing, very likely-but whatever was happening, Roland did not want to see it. He didn\u0027t want Jenna to see it, either.\\n\\n They half-walked, half-ran to the top of the ridge, and when they got there paused for breath in the moonlight, heads down, hands linked, both of them gasping harshly.\\n\\n The growling and snarling below them had faded, but was still faintly audible when Sister Jenna raised her head and asked him, \"What was it? you know-I saw it in your face. And how could it attack her? We all have power over animals, but she has-had-the most.\"\\n\\n \"Not over that one. \" Roland found himself recalling the unfortunate boy in the next bed. Norman hadn\u0027t known why the medallions kept the Sisters at arm\u0027s length-whether it was the gold or the God. Now Roland knew the answer. \"It was a dog. Just a town-dog. I saw it in the square, before the green folk knocked me out and took me to the Sisters. I suppose the other animals that could run away did run away, but not that one. it had nothing to fear from the Little Sisters of Eluria, and somehow it knew it didn\u0027t. It bears the sign of the Jesus-man on its chest. Black fur on white. just an accident of its birth, I imagine. In any case, it\u0027s done for her now. I knew it was lurking around. I heard it barking two or three times.\"\\n\\n \"Why?\" Jenna whispered. \"Why would it come? Why would it stay? And why would it take on her as it did?\"\\n\\n Roland of Gilead responded as he ever had and ever would when such useless, mystifying questions were raised: \"Ka. Come on. Let\u0027s get as far as we can from this place before we hide up for the day.\"\\n\\n As far as they could turned out to be eight miles at most... and probably, Roland thought as the two of them sank down in a patch of sweet-smelling sage beneath an overhang of rock, a good deal less. Five, perhaps. It was him slowing them down; or rather, it was the residue of the poison in the soup. When it was clear to him that he could not go farther without help, he asked her for one of the reeds. She refused, saying that the stuff in it might combine with the unaccustomed exercise to burst his heart.\\n\\n \"Besides,\" she said as they lay back against the embankment of the little nook they had found, \"they\u0027ll not follow. Those that are left-Michela, Louise, Tamra-will be packing up to move on. They know to leave when the time comes; that\u0027s why the Sisters have survived as long as they have. As We have. We\u0027re strong in some ways, but weak in many more. Sister\\n\\n Mary forgot that. It was her arrogance that did for her as much as the cross-dog, I think.\"\\n\\n She had cached not just his boots and clothes beyond the top of the ridge, but the smaller of his two purses, as well. When she tried apologize for not bringing his bedroll and the larger purse (she\u0027d tried she said, but they were simply too heavy), Roland hushed her with a finger to her lips. He thought it a miracle to have as much as he did. And besides (this he did not say, but perhaps she knew it, anyway), the guns were the only things which really mattered. The guns of his father, and his father before him, all the way back to the days of Arthur Eld when dreams about dragons had still walked the earth.\\n\\n \"Will you be all right?\" he asked her as they settled down. The moon had set, but dawn was still at least three hours away. They were surrounded the sweet smell of the sage. A purple smell, he thought it then... and ever after. Already he could feel it forming a kind of magic carpet under him, which would soon float him away to sleep. He thought he had never been so tired.\\n\\n \"Roland, I know not. \" But even then, he thought she had known. Her mother had brought her back once; no mother would bring her back again. And she had eaten with the others, had taken the communion of the Sisters. Ka was a wheel; it was also a net from which none ever escaped.\\n\\n But then he was too tired to think much of such things... and what good would thinking have done, in any case? As she had said, the bridge was burned. Even if they were to return to the valley, Roland guess they would find nothing but the cave the Sisters had called Thoughtful House. The surviving Sisters would have packed their tent of bad dreams and moved on, just a sound of bells and singing insects moving down the late night breeze.\\n\\n He looked at her raised a hand (it felt heavy), and touched the curl which once more lay across her forehead.\\n\\n Jenna laughed, embarrassed. \"That one always escapes. It\u0027s wayward Like its mistress.\"\\n\\n She raised her hand to poke it back in, but Roland took her fingers before she could. \"It\u0027s beautiful,\" he said. \"Black as night and as beautiful as forever.\"\\n\\n He sat up-it took an effort; weariness dragged at his body like soft hands. He kissed the curl. She closed her eyes and sighed. He felt her trembling beneath his lips. The skin of her brow was very cool; the dark curve of the wayward curl like silk.\\n\\n \"Push back your wimple, as you did before,\" he said.\\n\\n She did it without speaking. For a moment he only looked at her. Jenna looked back gravely, her eyes never leaving his. He ran his hands through her hair, feeling its smooth weight (like rain, he thought, rain with weight), then took her shoulders and kissed each of her cheeks. He drew back for a moment.\\n\\n \"Would ye kiss me as a man does a woman, Roland? On my mouth?\"\\n\\n Aye.\\n\\n And, as he had thought of doing as he lay caught in the silken infirmary tent, he kissed her lips. She kissed back with the clumsy sweetness of one who has never kissed before, except perhaps in dreams. Roland thought to make love to her then-it had been long and long, and she was beautiful but he fell asleep instead, still kissing her.\\n\\n He dreamed of the cross-dog, barking its way across a great open landscape. He followed, wanting to see the source of its agitation, and soon he did. At the far edge of that plain stood the Dark Tower, its smoky stone outlined by the dull orange ball of a setting sun, its fearful windows rising in a spiral. The dog stopped at the sight of it and began to howl.\\n\\n Bells-peculiarly shrill and as terrible as doom-began to ring. Dark bells, he knew, but their tone was as bright as silver. At their sound, the dark windows of the Tower glowed with a deadly red light-the red of poisoned roses. A scream of unbearable pain rose in the night.\\n\\n The dream blew away in an instant, but the scream remained, now unravelling to a moan. That part was real-as real as the Tower, brooding in its place at the very end of End-World. Roland came back to the brightness of dawn and the soft purple smell of desert sage. He had drawn both his guns, and was on his feet before he had fully realized he was awake.\\n\\n Jenna was gone. Her boots lay empty beside his purse. A little distance from them, her jeans lay as flat as discarded snakeskins. Above them was her shirt. It was, Roland observed with wonder, still tucked into the pants. Beyond them was her empty wimple, with its fringe of bells lying on the powdery ground. He thought for a moment that they were ringing, mistaking the sound he heard at first.\\n\\n Not bells but bugs. The doctor-bugs. They sang in the sage, sounding a bit like crickets, but far sweeter.\\n\\n \"Jenna?\"\\n\\n No answer... unless the bugs answered. For their singing suddenly stopped.\\n\\n \"Jenna?\"\\n\\n Nothing. Only the wind and the smell of the sage.\\n\\n Without thinking about what he was doing (like play-acting, reasoned thought was not his strong suit), he bent, picked up the wimple, and shook it. The Dark Bells rang.\\n\\n For a moment there was nothing. Then a thousand small dark creatures came scurrying out of the sage, gathering on the broken earth. Roland thought of the battalion marching down the side of the freighter\u0027s and took a step back. Then he held his position. As, he saw, the bugs holding theirs.\\n\\n He believed he understood. Some of this understanding came from his memory of how Sister Mary\u0027s flesh had felt under his hands... how it had felt various, not one thing but many. Part of it was what she had Said: I have supped with them. Such as them might never die but they might change.\\n\\n The insects trembled, a dark cloud of them blotting out the white powdery earth.\\n\\n Roland shook the bells again.\\n\\n A shiver ran through them in a subtle wave, and then they began form a shape. They hesitated as if unsure of how to go on, regrouped, began again. What they eventually made on the whiteness of the sand there between the blowing fluffs of lilac-coloured sage was one of Great Letters: the letter C.\\n\\n Except it wasn\u0027t really a letter, the gunslinger saw; it was a curl.\\n\\n They began to sing, and to Roland it sounded as if they were singing his name.\\n\\n The bells fell from his unnerved hand, and when they struck ground and chimed there, the mass of bugs broke apart, running every direction. He thought of calling them back-ringing the bell again might do that-but to what purpose? To what end?\\n\\n Ask me not, Roland. \"Tis done, the bridge burned.\\n\\n Yet she had come to him one last time, imposing her will over thousand various parts that should have lost the ability to think when the whole lost its cohesion... and yet she had thought, somehow enough to make that shape. How much effort might that have taken?\\n\\n They fanned wider and wider, some disappearing into the sage, some trundling up the sides of rock overhang, pouring into the cracks where they would, mayhap, wait out the heat of the day.\\n\\n They were gone. She was gone.\\n\\n Roland sat down on the ground and put his hands over his face. He thought he might weep, but in time the urge passed; when he raised his head again, his eyes were as dry as the desert he would eventually come to, still following the trail of Walter, the man in black.\\n\\n If there\u0027s to be damnation, she had said, let it be of my choosing, not theirs.\\n\\n He knew a little about damnation himself... and he had an idea that the lessons, far from being done, were just beginning.\\n\\n She had brought him the purse with his tobacco in it. He rolled a cigarette and smoked it hunkered over his knees. He smoked it down to a glowing roach, looking at her empty clothes the while, remembering the steady gaze of her dark eyes. Remembering the scorch-marks on her fingers from the chain of the medallion. Yet she had picked it up, because she had known he would want it; had dared that pain, and Roland now wore both around his neck.\\n\\n When the sun was fully up, the gunslinger moved on west.
