{"id":93568,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"When Roland awoke, it was full daylight, the silk roof overhead a bright white and billowing in a mild breeze. The doctor-bugs were singing contentedly. Beside him on his left, Norman was heavily asleep with his head turned so far to one side that his stubbly cheek rested on his shoulder.\\n\\n Roland and John Norman were the only ones here. Further down on their side of the infirmary, the bed where the bearded man had been was empty, it\u0027s top sheet pulled up and neatly tucked in, the pillow neatly nestled in a crisp white case. The complication of slings in which his body had rested was gone.\\n\\n Roland remembered the candles-the way their glow had combined and streamed up in a column, illuminating the Sisters as they gathered around the bearded man. Giggling. Their damned bells jingling.\\n\\n Now, as if summoned by his thoughts, came Sister Mary, gliding along rapidly with Sister Louise in her wake. Louise bore a tray, and looked nervous. Mary was frowning, obviously not in good temper.\\n\\n To be grumpy after you\u0027ve fed so well? Roland thought. Fie, Sister.\\n\\n She reached the gunslinger\u0027s bed and looked down at him. \"I have little to thank ye for, sai,\" she said with no preamble.\\n\\n \"Have I asked for your thanks?\" he responded in a voice that sounded as dusty and little-used as the pages of an old book.\\n\\n She took no notice. \"Ye\u0027ve made one who was only impudent and restless with her place outright rebellious. Well, her mother was the same way, and died of it not long after returning Jenna to her proper Place. Raise your hand, thankless man.\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t. I can\u0027t move at all.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, cully! Haven\u0027t you heard it said \"fool not your mother \"less she\u0027s out of face\"? I know pretty well what ye can and can\u0027t do. Now raise your hand.\"\\n\\n Roland raised his right hand, trying to suggest more effort than it, actually took. He thought that this morning he might be strong enough to slip free of the slings... but what then? Any real walking would beyond him for hours yet, even without another dose of \"medicine\"... and behind Sister Mary, Sister Louise was taking the cover from a fresh bowl of soup. As Roland looked at it, his stomach rumbled.\\n\\n Big Sister heard and smiled a bit. \"Even lying in bed builds an appetite in a strong man, if it\u0027s done long enough. Wouldn\u0027t you say so, Jason brother of John?\"\\n\\n \"My name is James. As you well know, Sister.\"\\n\\n \"Do I?\" She laughed angrily. \"Oh, la! And if I whipped your little sweetheart hard enough and long enough-until the blood jumped her back like drops of sweat, let us say-should I not whip a different name out of her? Or didn\u0027t ye trust her with it, during your little talk?\"\\n\\n \"Touch her and I\u0027ll kill you.\"\\n\\n She laughed again. Her face shimmered; her firm mouth turned into something that looked like a dying jellyfish. \"Speak not of killing to us cully, lest we speak of it to you.\"\\n\\n \"Sister, if you and Jenna don\u0027t see eye to eye, why not release her from her vows and let her go her course?\"\\n\\n \"Such as us can never be released from our vows, nor be let go. Her mother tried and then came back, her dying and the girl sick. Why, it was we nursed Jenna back to health after her mother was nothing but dirt in the breeze that blows out towards End-World, and how little she thanks us! Besides, she bears the Dark Bells, the sigil of our sisterhood. Of our ka-tet. Now eat-yer belly says ye\u0027re hungry!\"\\n\\n Sister Louise offered the bowl, but her eyes kept drifting to the shape the medallion made under the breast of his bed-dress. Don\u0027t like it, do you? Roland thought, and then remembered Louise by candlelight, the freighter\u0027s blood on her chin, her ancient eyes eager as she leaned forward to lick his spend from Sister Mary\u0027s hand.\\n\\n He turned his head aside. \"I want nothing.\"\\n\\n \"But ye\u0027re hungry!\" Louise protested. \"If\u0027ee don\u0027t eat, James, how will\u0027ee get\u0027ee strength back?\"\\n\\n \"Send Jenna. I\u0027ll eat what she brings.\"\\n\\n Sister Mary\u0027s frown was black. \"Ye\u0027ll see her no more. She\u0027s been released from Thoughtful House only on her solemn promise to double her time of meditation... and to stay out of the infirmary. Now eat, James, or whoever ye are. Take what\u0027s in the soup, or we\u0027ll cut ye with knives and rub it in with flannel poultices. Either way, makes no difference to us. Does it? Louise?\"\\n\\n \"Nar,\" Louise said. She still held out the bowl. Steam rose from it, and the good smell of chicken.\\n\\n \"But it might make a difference to you. \" Sister Mary grinned humourlessly, baring her unnaturally large teeth. \"Flowing blood\u0027s risky around here. The doctors don\u0027t like it. It stirs them up.\"\\n\\n It wasn\u0027t just the bugs that were stirred up at the sight of blood, and Roland knew it. He also knew he had no choice in the matter of the soup. He took the bowl from Louise and ate slowly. He would have given much to wipe but the look of satisfaction he saw on Sister Mary\u0027s face.\\n\\n \"Good,\" she said after he had handed the bowl back and she had peered inside to make sure it was completely empty. His hand thumped back into the sling which had been rigged for it, already too heavy to hold up. He could feel the world drawing away again.\\n\\n Sister Mary leaned forward, the billowing top of her habit touching the skin of his left shoulder. He could smell her, an aroma both ripe and dry, and would have gagged if he\u0027d had the strength.\\n\\n \"Have that foul gold thing off ye when yer strength comes back a little-put it in the pissoir under the bed. Where it belongs. For to be even this close to where it lies hurts my head and makes my throat close.\"\\n\\n Speaking with enormous effort, Roland said: \"If you want it, take it. How can I stop you, you bitch?\"\\n\\n Once more her frown turned her face into something like a thunderhead. He thought she would have slapped him, if she had dared touch him so close to where the medallion lay. Her ability to touch seemed to end above his waist, however.\\n\\n \"I think you had better consider the matter a little more fully,\" she said. \"I can still have Jenna whipped, if I like. She bears the Dark Bells, but I am the Big Sister. Consider that very well.\"\\n\\n She left. Sister Louise followed, casting one look-a strange combination Of fright and lust-back over her shoulder.\\n\\n Roland thought, I must get out of here-I must.\\n\\n Instead, he drifted back to that dark place which wasn\u0027t quite sleep. Or perhaps he did sleep, at least for a while; perhaps he dreamed. Fingers once more caressed his fingers, and lips first kissed his ear and then whispered into it: \"Look beneath your pillow, Roland... but let no one know I was here.\"\\n\\n At some point after this, Roland opened his eyes again, half-expecting to see Sister Jenna\u0027s pretty young face hovering above him, and that comma of dark hair once more poking out from beneath her wimple. There was no one. The swags of silk overhead were at their brightest, and although it was impossible to tell the hours in here with any real accuracy, Roland guessed it to be around noon. Perhaps three hours since his second bowl of the Sisters\" soup.\\n\\n Beside him, John Norman still slept, his breath whistling out in faint, nasal snores.\\n\\n Roland tried to raise his hand and slide it under his pillow. The hand wouldn\u0027t move. He could wiggle the tips of his fingers, but that was all. He waited, calming his mind as well as he could, gathering his patience. \" Patience wasn\u0027t easy to come by. He kept thinking about what Norman had said-that there had been twenty survivors of the ambush... at least to start with. One by one they went, until only me and that one down yonder was left. And now you.\\n\\n The girl wasn\u0027t here. His mind spoke in the soft, regretful tone of Alain, one of his old friends, dead these many years now. She wouldn\u0027t dare, not with the others watching. That was only a dream you had.\\n\\n But Roland thought perhaps it had been more than a dream.\\n\\n Some length of time later-the slowly shifting brightness overhead made him believe it had been about an hour-Roland tried his hand again. This time he was able to get it beneath his pillow. This was puffy and soft, tucked snugly into the wide sling which supported the gunslinger\u0027s neck. At first he found nothing, but as his fingers worked their slow way deeper, they touched what felt like a stiffish bundle of thin rods.\\n\\n He paused, gathering a little more strength (every movement was like swimming in glue), and then burrowed deeper. It felt like a dead bouquet. Wrapped around it was what felt like a ribbon.\\n\\n Roland looked around to make sure the ward was still empty and Norman still asleep, then drew out what was under the pillow. It was six brittle stems of fading green with brownish reed-heads at the tops. They gave off a strange, yeasty aroma that made Roland think of early-morning begging expeditions to the Great House kitchens as a child-forays he had usually made with Cuthbert. The reeds were tied with a wide white silk ribbon, and smelled like burned toast. Beneath the ribbon was a fold of cloth. Like everything else in this cursed place, it seemed, the cloth was of silk.\\n\\n Roland was breathing hard and could feel drops of sweat on his brow. Still alone, though-good. He took the scrap of cloth and unfolded it. Printed painstakingly in blurred charcoal letters, was this message:\\n\\n NIBBLE HEDS. Once each hour. Too\\n\\n much, CRAMPS or DETH.\\n\\n TOMORROW NITE. Can\u0027t be sooner.\\n\\n BE CAREFUL!\\n\\n No explanation, but Roland supposed none was needed. Nor did he have any option; if he remained here, he would die. All they had to do was have the medallion off him, and he felt sure Sister Mary was smart enough to figure a way to do that.\\n\\n He nibbled at one of the dry reed-heads. The taste was nothing like the toast they had begged from the kitchen as boys; it was bitter in his throat and hot in his stomach. Less than a minute after his nibble, his heart-rate had doubled. His muscles awakened, but not in a pleasant way, as after good sleep; they felt first trembly and then hard, as if they were gathered into knots. This feeling passed rapidly, and his heartbeat was back to normal before Norman stirred awake an hour or so later, but he understood why Jenna\u0027s note had warned him not to take more than a nibble at a time-this was very powerful stuff.\\n\\n He slipped the bouquet of reeds back under the pillow, being careful to brush away the few crumbles of vegetable matter which had dropped to the sheet. Then he used the ball of his thumb to blur the painstaking charcoaled words on the bit of silk. When he was finished, there was nothing on the square but meaningless smudges. The square he also tucked back under his pillow.\\n\\n When Norman awoke, he and the gunslinger spoke briefly of the young scout\u0027s home-Delain, it was, sometimes known jestingly as Dragon\u0027s Lair, or Liar\u0027s Heaven. All tall tales were said to orginate in Delain. The boy asked Roland to take his medallion and that of his brother home to their parents, if Roland was able, and explain as well as he could what had happened to James and John, sons of Jesse.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll do all that yourself,\" Roland said.\\n\\n \"No. \" Norman tried to raise his hand, perhaps to scratch his nose, and was unable to do even that. The hand rose perhaps six inches, then fell back to the counterpane with a small thump. \"I think not. It\u0027s a pity for us to have run up against each other this way, you know-I like you.\"\\n\\n \"And I you, John Norman. Would that we were better met.\"\\n\\n \"Aye. When not in the company of such fascinating ladies.\"\\n\\n He dropped off to sleep again soon after. Roland never spoke with him again... although he certainly heard from him. Yes. Roland was lying above his bed, shamming sleep, as John Norman screamed his last.\\n\\n Sister Michela came with his evening soup just as Roland was getting past the shivery muscles and galloping heartbeat that resulted from his second nibble of brown reed. Michela looked at his flushed face with some concern, but had to accept his assurances that he did not feel feverish; she couldn\u0027t bring herself to touch him and judge the heat of his skin for herself-the medallion held her away.\\n\\n With the soup was a popkin. The bread was leathery and the meat inside it tough, but Roland demolished it greedily, just the same. Michela watched with a complacent smile, hands folded in front of her, nodding from time to time. When he had finished the soup, she took the bowl back from him carefully, making sure their fingers did not touch.\\n\\n \"Ye\u0027re healing,\" she said. \"Soon you\u0027ll be on yer way, and we\u0027ll have just yer memory to keep, Jim.\"\\n\\n \"Is that true?\" he asked quietly.\\n\\n She only looked at him, touched her tongue against her upper lip, giggled, and departed. Roland closed his eyes and lay back against hi pillow, feeling lethargy steal over him again. Her speculative eyes... he peeping tongue. He had seen women look at roast chickens and joints of mutton that same way, calculating when they might be done.\\n\\n His body badly wanted to sleep, but Roland held on to wakefulness for what he judged was an hour, then worked one of the reeds out from under the pillow. With a fresh infusion of their \"can\u0027t-move-medicine\" in his system, this took an enormous effort, and he wasn\u0027t sure he could have done it at all, had he not separated this one reed from the ribbon holding the others. Tomorrow night, Jenna\u0027s note had said. If that meant escape, the idea seemed preposterous. The way he felt now, he might be lying in this bed until the end of the age.\\n\\n He nibbled. Energy washed into his system, clenching his muscles and racing his heart, but the burst of vitality was gone almost as soon as it came, buried beneath the Sisters\" stronger drug. He could only hope... and sleep.\\n\\n When he woke it was full dark, and he found he could move his arms and legs in their network of slings almost naturally. He slipped one of the reeds out from beneath his pillow and nibbled cautiously. She had left half a dozen, and the first two were now almost entirely consumed.\\n\\n The gunslinger put the stem back under the pillow, then began to shiver like a wet dog in a downpour. I took too much, he thought. I\u0027ll be lucky not to convulse -\\n\\n His heart, racing like a runaway engine. And then, to make matters worse, he saw candlelight at the far end of the aisle. A moment later he heard the rustle of their gowns and the whisk of their slippers.\\n\\n Gods, why now? They\u0027ll see me shaking, they\u0027ll know -\\n\\n Calling on every bit of his willpower and control, Roland dosed his eyes and concentrated on stilling his jerking limbs. If only he had been in bed instead of in these cursed slings, which seemed to tremble as if with their own ague at every movement!\\n\\n The Little Sisters drew closer. The light of their candles bloomed red within his closed eyelids. Tonight they were not giggling, nor whispering amongst themselves. It was not until they were almost on top of him that Roland became aware of the stranger in their midst-a creature that breathed through its nose in great, slobbery gasps of mixed air and snot.\\n\\n The gunslinger lay with his eyes closed, the gross twitches and jumps of his arms and legs under control, but with his muscles still knotted arid crampy, thrumming beneath the skin. Anyone who looked at him closely would see at once that something was wrong with him. His heart was larruping away like a horse under the whip, surely they must see\\n\\n But it wasn\u0027t him they were looking at-not yet, at least.\\n\\n \"Have it off him,\" Mary said. She spoke in a bastardized version of the low speech Roland could barely understand. \"Then t\u0027other \"un. Go on, Ralph.\"\\n\\n \"U\u0027se has whik-sky?\" the slobberer asked, his dialect even heavier than Mary\u0027s. Use has \"backky?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, yes, plenty whisky and plenty smoke, but not until you have these wretched things off!\" Impatient. Perhaps afraid, as well.\\n\\n Roland cautiously rolled his head to the left and cracked his eyelids open.\\n\\n Five of the six Little Sisters of Eluria were clustered around the far side of the sleeping John Norman\u0027s bed, their candles raised to cast their light upon him. It also cast light upon their own faces, faces which would have given the strongest man nightmares. Now, in the ditch of the night, their glamours were set aside, and they were but ancient corpses in voluminous habits.\\n\\n Sister Mary had one of Roland\u0027s guns in her hand. Looking at her holding it, Roland felt a bright flash of hate for her, and promised himself she would pay for her temerity.\\n\\n The thing standing at the foot of the bed, strange as it was, looked almost normal in comparison to the Sisters. It was one of the green folk.\\n\\n Roland recognized Ralph at once. He would be a long time forgetting that bowler hat.\\n\\n Now Ralph walked slowly around to the side of Norman\u0027s bed closest to Roland, momentarily blocking the gunslinger\u0027s view of the Sisters. The mutie went all the way to Norman\u0027s head, however, clearing the hags to Roland\u0027s slitted view once more.\\n\\n Norman\u0027s medallion lay exposed-the boy had perhaps waken enough to take it out of his bed-dress, hoping it would protect him better so. Ralph picked it up in his melted-tallow hand. The Sister watched eagerly in the glow of their candles as the green man stretched to the end of its chain... and then put it down again. Their faces droop in disappointment.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t care for such as that,\" Ralph said in his clotted voice. \"Want whik-sky! Want \"backky!\"\\n\\n \"You shall have it,\" Sister Mary said. \"Enough for you and all you verminous clan. But first, you must have that horrid thing off him! both of them! Do you understand? And you shan\u0027t tease us.\"\\n\\n \"Or what?\" Ralph asked. He laughed. It was a choked and gargly sound the laughter of a man dying from some evil sickness of the throat an lungs, but Roland still liked it better than the giggles of the Sisters \"Or what, Sisser Mary, you\u0027ll drink my bluid? My bluid\u0027d drop\u0027ee dead where\u0027ee stand, and glowing in the dark!\"\\n\\n Mary raised the gunslinger\u0027s revolver and pointed it at Ralph. \"Take that wretched thing, or you die where you stand.\"\\n\\n \"And die after I\u0027ve done what you want, likely.\"\\n\\n Sister Mary said nothing to that. The others peered at him with their black eyes.\\n\\n Ralph lowered his head, appearing to think. Roland suspected hi friend Bowler Hat could think, too. Sister Mary and her cohorts might, not believe that, but Ralph had to be trig to have survived as long as he had. But of course when he came here, he hadn\u0027t considered Roland\u0027s guns.\\n\\n \"Smasher was wrong to give them shooters to you,\" he said at last. \"Give em and not tell me. Did u\u0027se give him whik-sky? Give him \"backky?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s none o\" yours,\" Sister Mary replied. \"You have that goldpiece off the boy\u0027s neck right now, or I\u0027ll put one of yonder man\u0027s bullets in what\u0027s left of yer brain.\"\\n\\n \"All right,\" Ralph said. \"Just as you wish, sai.\"\\n\\n Once more he reached down and took the gold medallion in his melted fist. That he did slow; what happened after, happened fast. He snatched it away, breaking the chain and flinging the gold heedlessly into the dark. With his other hand he reached down, sank his long and ragged nails into John Norman\u0027s neck, and tore it open.\\n\\n Blood flew from the hapless boy\u0027s throat in a jetting, heart-driven gush more black than red in the candlelight, and he made a single bubbly cry. The women screamed-but not in horror. They screamed as women do in a frenzy of excitement. The green man was forgotten; Roland was forgotten; all was forgotten save the life\u0027s blood pouring out of John Norman\u0027s throat.\\n\\n They dropped their candles. Mary dropped Roland\u0027s revolver in the same hapless, careless fashion. The last the gunslinger saw as Ralph darted away into the shadows (whisky and tobacco another time, wily Ralph must have thought; tonight he had best concentrate on saving his own life) was the sisters bending forward to catch as much of the flow as they could before it dried up.\\n\\n Roland lay in the dark, muscles shivering, heart pounding, listening to the harpies as they fed on the boy lying in the bed next to his own. It seemed to go on for ever, but at last they had done with him. The Sisters re-lit their candles and left, murmuring.\\n\\n When the drug in the soup once more got the better of the drug in the reeds, Roland was grateful... yet for the first time since coming here, his sleep was haunted.\\n\\n In his dream he stood looking down at the bloated body in the town trough, thinking of a line in the book marked REGISTRY OF MISDEEDS amp; REDRESS. Green folk sent hence, it had read, and perhaps the green folk had been sent hence, but then a worse tribe had come. The Little Sisters of Eluria, they called themselves. And a year hence, they might be the Little Sisters of Tejuas, or of Kambero, or some other far-western village. They came with their bells and their bugs... from where? Who knew? Did it matter?\\n\\n A shadow fell beside his on the scummy water of the trough. Roland tried to turn and face it. He couldn\u0027t; he was frozen in place. Then a green hand grasped his shoulder and whirled him about. It was Ralph. His bowler hat was cocked back on his head; John Norman\u0027s medallion, now red with blood, hung around his neck.\\n\\n \"Booh!\" cried Ralph, his lips stretching in a toothless grin. He raised a big revolver with worn sandalwood grips. He thumbed the hammer back-and Roland jerked awake, shivering all over, dressed in skin both wet and icy cold. He looked at the bed on his left. It was empty, the sheet pulled up and tucked about neatly, the pillow resting above it in its snowy sleeve. Of John Norman there was no sign. It might have been empty for years, that bed.\\n\\n Roland was alone now. Gods help him, he was the last patient of the Little Sisters of Eluria, those sweet and patient hospitallers. The last human being still alive in this terrible place, the last with warm blood flowing in his veins.\\n\\n Roland, lying suspended, gripped the gold medallion in his fist and looked across the aisle at the long row of empty beds. After a little while, he brought one of the reeds out from beneath his pillow and nibbled at it.\\n\\n When Mary came fifteen minutes later, the gunslinger took the bowl she brought with a show of weakness he didn\u0027t really feel. Porridge instead of soup this time... but he had no doubt the basic ingredient was still the same.\\n\\n \"How well ye look this morning, sai,\" Big Sister said. She looked well herself-there were no shimmers to give away the ancient wampir hiding inside her. She had supped well, and her meal had firmed her up. Roland, stomach rolled over at the thought. \"Ye\u0027ll be on yer pins in no time, I warrant.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s shit,\" Roland said, speaking in an ill-natured growl. \"Put me on my pins and you\u0027d be picking me up off the floor directly after. I\u0027ve start to wonder if you\u0027re not putting something in the food.\"\\n\\n She laughed merrily at that. \"La, you lads! Always eager to blame weakness on a scheming woman! How scared of us ye are-aye, way down in yer little boys\" hearts, how scared ye are!\"\\n\\n \"Where\u0027s my brother? I dreamed there was a commotion about him in the night, and now I see his bed\u0027s empty.\"\\n\\n Her smile narrowed. Her eyes glittered. \"He came over fevery and pitched a fit. We\u0027ve taken him to Thoughtful House, which has been home to contagion more than once in its time.\"\\n\\n To the grave is where you\u0027ve taken him, Roland thought. Mayhap that is a Thoughtful House, but little would you know it, sai, one way or another.\\n\\n \"I know ye\u0027re no brother to that boy,\" Mary said, watching him eat. Already Roland could feel the stuff hidden in the porridge draining his strength once more. \"Sigil or no sigil, I know ye\u0027re no brother to him. Why do you lie? \"Tis a sin against God.\"\\n\\n \"What gives you such an idea, sai?\" Roland asked, curious to see if she would mention the guns.\\n\\n \"Big Sister knows what she knows. Why not \"fess up, Jimmy? Confession\u0027s good for the soul, they say.\"\\n\\n \"Send me Jenna to pass the time, and perhaps I\u0027d tell you much,\" Roland said.\\n\\n The narrow bone of smile on Sister Mary\u0027s face disappeared like chalkwriting in a rainstorm. \"Why would ye talk to such as her?\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s passing fair,\" Roland said. \"Unlike some.\"\\n\\n Her lips pulled back from her overlarge teeth. \"Ye\u0027ll see her no more, cully. Ye\u0027ve stirred her up, so you have, and I won\u0027t have that.\"\\n\\n She turned to go. Still trying to appear weak and hoping he would not overdo it (acting was never his forte), Roland held out the empty porridge bowl. \"Do you not want to take this?\"\\n\\n \"Put it on your head and wear it as a nightcap, for all of me. Or stick it ill your ass. You\u0027ll talk before I\u0027m done with ye, cully-talk till I bid you shut up and then beg to talk some more!\"\\n\\n On this note she swept regally away, hands lifting the front of her skirt off the floor. Roland had heard that such as she couldn\u0027t go about in daylight, and that part of the old tales was surely a lie. Yet another part was almost true, it seemed: a fuzzy, amorphous shape kept pace with her, running along the row of empty beds to her right, but she cast no real shadow at all. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-little-sisters-of-eluria-the-dark-tower-0-5/page-5.html","bookId":2575,"book":{"id":2575,"title":"The Little Sisters of Eluria (The Dark Tower #0.5)","description":"Storyline: The Little Sisters of Eluria (Stephen King\u0027s The Dark Tower - Graphic Novel series #7) \\n Near death from an attack by Slow Mutants, Roland Deschain is taken in by a group of Sisters who specialize in anything but the healing arts.
