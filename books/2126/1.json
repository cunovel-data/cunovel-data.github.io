{"id":93892,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"A dog barked, shattering the midnight silence. Gabriel glanced up briefly, his psychic senses alert. Then he went back to breaking into the house.\\n\\n In a moment, the lock on the door gave way to his lockpick. The door swung open.\\n\\n Gabriel smiled.\\n\\n There were four people awake in the house. One of them Kaitlyn. Beautiful Kaitlyn with the red-gold hair. A pity he might have to destroy her-but he was her enemy from now on. He couldn\u0027t afford weakness.\\n\\n He was working for Mr. Zetes now. And Mr. Zetes needed something-a shard from the last perfect crystal in the world. Kaitlyn had it... Gabriel was going to take it.\\n\\n As simple as that.\\n\\n If anyone tried to stop him, he was going to have to hurt them. Even Kaitlyn.\\n\\n For just an instant there was a tightening in his chest. Then his face hardened and he moved stealthily into the dark house.\\n\\n \"Give up, Kaitlyn.\"\\n\\n Kaitlyn looked into Gabriel\u0027s dark gray eyes.\\n\\n \"How did you get in here?\" she said.\\n\\n Gabriel smiled silkily. \"Breaking and entering is one of my new talents.\"\\n\\n \"This is Marisol\u0027s house,\" Rob said from behind him. \"You can\u0027t just-\"\\n\\n \"But I have just. Don\u0027t expect help; I\u0027ve put everybody outside to sleep. I\u0027m here, and I think you know why.\"\\n\\n They all stared at him: Kaitlyn and Rob and Lewis and Anna. They were refugees, runaways from the Zetes Institute for Psychic Research, and Marisol\u0027s family had taken them in. Marisol herself was absent; once a research assistant at the Institute, she\u0027d found out too much and ended up in a coma. But her family had been kind-and now Kaitlyn had brought more trouble on them.\\n\\n It was past midnight. The four of them had been sitting up in the room Marisol\u0027s brother had assigned the girls, talking and trying to figure out what to do next. And then the door had opened to reveal Gabriel.\\n\\n Kaitlyn, who was standing directly in front of the handsome mahogany desk by Marisol\u0027s bed, made her face utterly blank. She tried to make her mind blank, too.\\n\\n Anna and Lewis, who were sitting on the bed, were looking just as blank, and Rob\u0027s mind was just one wash of golden light. Nothing for Gabriel to grab onto.\\n\\n It didn\u0027t matter. He looked past Kaitlyn, at the desk, and his smile was dazzling and dangerous.\\n\\n \"Give up,\" he said again. \"I want it, and I\u0027m going to get it.\"\\n\\n \"We don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about,\" Rob said flatly, taking a step toward him.\\n\\n Gabriel answered without turning to look at Rob. He was still smiling but his eyes were dark. \"A shard of the last perfect crystal,\" he said. \"Do you want to play hot and cold-or should I just take it?\" He looked at the desk again.\\n\\n \"If we did have it, we wouldn\u0027t be giving it to you,\" Rob said. \"We\u0027d use it to destroy your boss-he is your boss now, isn\u0027t he?\"\\n\\n Gabriel\u0027s smile froze. His eyes narrowed slightly, and Kaitlyn could see darkness rilling them. But his voice was calm and easygoing. \"Sure, he\u0027s my boss. And you\u0027d better stay away from him or you\u0027re going to get hurt.\"\\n\\n Kaitlyn could feel a stinging behind her eyes. She didn\u0027t believe this was happening, she didn\u0027t. Gabriel was standing here like a stranger, warning them away from Mr. Zetes. From Mr. Zetes, the man who\u0027d tried to make them into psychic weapons to sell to the highest bidder, who\u0027d tried to kill them when they rebelled. Who\u0027d hounded them all the way up to Canada when they ran away from him, and who was clearly still after them now that they\u0027d returned to fight him. They\u0027d hoped Marisol\u0027s house would be a safe place to hide from him-but they\u0027d been wrong.\\n\\n \"How can you, Gabriel?\" Anna said in her low, clear voice, and Kaitlyn knew she was feeling the same thing. Anna Eva Whiteraven\u0027s face-usually serene between its dark braids of hair-was now clouded.\\n\\n \"How can you join him? After everything he\u0027s done-\"\\n\\n \"-and everything he\u0027s going to do,\" Lewis put in. Lewis Chao was normally as cheerful as Anna was serene, but now his almond-shaped eyes were bleak. \"He\u0027s bad, Gabriel; he\u0027s bad, and you know it,\"\\n\\n Reb said, closing in from behind. Rob Kessler wasn\u0027t built for menace either, but just now with his tousled blond hair and blazing golden eyes he looked like an avenging angel.\\n\\n \"And he\u0027ll turn on you in the end,\" Kaitlyn said, adding her voice to the chorus against Gabriel. In her mind she added herself to the group: Kaitlyn Fair-child, not as gentle as Anna and Lewis or as good as Rob, a girl with fiery hair and a temper. And eyes that people called witchy, smoky blue with darker blue rings in them. Right now, Kait fixed these eyes mercilessly on Gabriel, staring him down. Gabriel Wolfe threw back his head and laughed. As always, it almost took Kaitlyn\u0027s breath away. Gabriel was so handsome it was frightening. His pale skin made his dark hair look even darker, like the silky pelt of some animal-like his namesake. A wolf, a predator in his bones, who enjoyed stalking and toying with his prey.\\n\\n Of course he\u0027s bad, Gabriel said. Kaitlyn heard the words in her head, rather than with her ears, and the tone was amused and mocking. I\u0027m bad, too-or hadn\u0027t you noticed?\\n\\n Tiny needles of pain jabbed into Kaitlyn\u0027s temples. She managed not to gasp, but she could sense Anna\u0027s alarm, and Lewis\u0027s and Rob\u0027s. Gabriel had gotten stronger. Kaitlyn could feel it through the psychic web that connected the five of them, the web that Gabriel had created. The web that would link them until one of the five died. They were all psychics: Rob was a healer and Kaitlyn saw the future, Lewis was psychokinetic and Anna controlled animals-but Gabriel was a telepath. He fused minds. He\u0027d fused their minds, the five of them, by accident, and now they were like the arms of a starfish: separate but part of one being.\\n\\n Gabriel\u0027s power had always been strongest, but now it rocked Kaitlyn with its force. His mental voice had been amused, yes-but it had also been like a white-hot poker burning the words directly into her brain.\\n\\n By contrast, Lewis\u0027s thought sounded weak and distant. I\u0027m scared.\\n\\n Kaitlyn glanced at him quickly and saw that he hadn\u0027t meant it to be heard. That was the problem with telepathy, with the web that connected them, held them close. It held them too close, sometimes, throwing their private thoughts into the public forum. Leaving them totally exposed, naked to one another.\\n\\n Unable to hide anything.\\n\\n Realization flashed through her, and she looked back at Gabriel.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s it, isn\u0027t it?\" she said. \"Why you left. It was too much for you, being so close. It was too intimate-\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Gabriel, we all feel the same way,\" Anna said, picking up on Kaitlyn\u0027s theme. \"We\u0027d all like some privacy. But we\u0027re your friends-\"\\n\\n Gabriel\u0027s smile was savage. \"I don\u0027t need friends.\"\\n\\n \"Well, you\u0027ve got them, boy,\" Rob said softly. He moved in another step and his hand closed on Gabriel\u0027s shoulder. With a gesture that made it look easy, he turned Gabriel around.\\n\\n Kaitlyn could feel Gabriel\u0027s startled outrage in the web. Rob ignored it, speaking quietly and seriously, looking Gabriel straight in the face. His anger was gone, and so was the usual defensiveness that flared between him and Gabriel, the male rivalry, the jostling for position. Rob was struggling with his pride, his internal honesty conquering it. Forcing himself to be vulnerable with Gabriel.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re more than friends,\" he said. \"We\u0027re part of each other, all of us. You made us that way. You linked us together to save our lives-and now you\u0027re telling us you\u0027ve defected to the bad guys? That you\u0027re our enemy?\" He shook his head. \"I don\u0027t believe it.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s because you\u0027re an idealistic idiot,\" Gabriel hissed, his voice as soft as Rob\u0027s, but feral and menacing. He didn\u0027t try to move out of Rob\u0027s grip. \"Believe it, country boy-because if you mess with me, you\u0027re going to be sorry.\"\\n\\n Rob shook his head. He had a look in his eyes that Kaitlyn knew well, and his jaw was at his most stubborn. \"You can\u0027t fool me, Gabriel. You act like a dumb tough guy but you\u0027re not, you\u0027re smart. One of the smartest people I\u0027ve ever met. You could make something of yourself-\"\\n\\n \"I am-\" Gabriel began, but Rob went on, gentle and relentless.\\n\\n \"You act like you don\u0027t care about people, but that\u0027s not true either. You saved us all from the crystal when Joyce and Mr. Z were trying to kill us with it. You saved us again when they trapped us at the Institute. You helped Kaitlyn save us from that psychic attack in the van.\"\\n\\n And then Rob did something that astonished Kaitlyn. He actually shook Gabriel. Once again, startled outrage washed through the web, but before Gabriel could say anything Rob was speaking again, fierce and insistent. \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re trying to prove, but it\u0027s no good. It\u0027s no good. You care about us; you can\u0027t change that. Why don\u0027t you just give in and admit it, Gabriel? Why don\u0027t you stop this nonsense right now?\"\\n\\n Kaitlyn\u0027s breath was caught in her throat. She didn\u0027t dare breathe, didn\u0027t dare move. Rob was walking on a tightrope above razors and knives. He was insane-but it was working.\\n\\n Gabriel\u0027s body had relaxed slightly, some of the predator-tension draining out of it. And though Kaitlyn couldn\u0027t see his eyes, she guessed that they were lightening, a warm gray instead of cold. His presence in the web was warming, too; Kaitlyn no longer got images of stalactites and glaciers. Under the burning heat of Rob\u0027s golden eyes, Gabriel\u0027s icebergs were cracking up.\\n\\n \"We all care about you,\" Rob said, never letting up the intensity. \"And your place is right here. Come back to us and help us get rid of Mr. Z, okay? Okay, Gabriel?\"\\n\\n And then he made his mistake.\\n\\n He\u0027d been speaking vehemently, throwing his words into Gabriel\u0027s face, and Gabriel had been listening as if he couldn\u0027t help it. Almost as if he were hypnotized. But now Rob switched to nonverbal communication to punch his message directly into Gabriel\u0027s mind. Kaitlyn knew why he did it- telepathy was forceful and intimate. Too intimate. Her cry of warning was lost as Gabriel snapped.\\n\\n Come back, Rob was saying. Come back, Gabriel- okay?\\n\\n Kaitlyn felt fury building in Gabriel like a tsunami. Rob, she thought. Rob, don\u0027t-Leave me ALONE!\\n\\n The mental shout was like a physical blow. Literally. It threw Rob backward, body spasming in total reflex as the signals from his own brain scrambled. He fell with every muscle contracted, his face twisted, his fingers clawed. Kaitlyn felt a spasm of sheer terror on his behalf. She wanted to run to him, but she couldn\u0027t. Gabriel was between them and her legs wouldn\u0027t move. Anna and Lewis stood frozen as well.\\n\\n I don\u0027t need any of you, Gabriel said, still with enough force to numb Kaitlyn\u0027s mind. You\u0027re wrong about me. I\u0027m no part of you. You can\u0027t even imagine what I am, what I\u0027ve become.\\n\\n \"I can,\" Kaitlyn gasped. She was thinking of what Mr. Zetes\u0027s crystal had done to him, what it had made him. A psychic vampire, who needed to drain life energy from others to live himself. She could feel the ghost of teeth in her spine, just at the base of the neck. As if a single sharp tooth were piercing the skin there.\\n\\n The memory brought a certain fear, but no revulsion. And anxious as she was to get to Rob and help him, she wanted to help Gabriel, too.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not your fault, Gabriel,\" she whispered. \"You think you\u0027re evil because of what you can do with your mind, because of what the crystal made you do. But it\u0027s not your fault. You didn\u0027t ask for it. And you\u0027re not evil.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s where you\u0027re wrong.\" Gabriel had turned to face her, and she saw that he was calmer. But the ice was back in his eyes, the cold, lucid madness that was more terrifying than any rage. When he smiled, goose-flesh broke out on Kait\u0027s arms.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve known what I am for a long time,\" he said conversationally. \"The crystal didn\u0027t change me, it just enhanced my abilities. And it made me accept myself.\" His smile widened, and Kaitlyn had a primal instinct to run. \"If you\u0027ve got the darkness in your nature, you might as well enjoy it. Might as well go where you belong.\"\\n\\n \"To Mr. Zetes,\" Anna whispered, her lovely, high-cheekboned face drawn with disgust.\\n\\n Gabriel shrugged. \"He has a vision. He thinks psychics like me have a place in the world-on top. I\u0027m superior to the rest of the lousy race, I\u0027m smarter, stronger, better. I deserve to rule. And I\u0027m not going to let any of you stop me.\"\\n\\n Kaitlyn shook her head, struggling with words. \"Gabriel-I don\u0027t believe that. You\u0027re not- \"\\n\\n \"I am. And if you try to keep me from getting that shard, I\u0027m going to prove it to you.\"\\n\\n He was looking at the desk again. Kaitlyn drew herself up a little. Rob was still lying helpless on the floor; Lewis and Anna seemed frozen. There was nobody but her to stop him.\\n\\n \"You can\u0027t have it,\" she said.\\n\\n \"Get out of the way.\"\\n\\n \"I said, you can\u0027t have it.\" To her amazement, her voice was fairly steady.\\n\\n He moved closer to her, his gray eyes filling her field of vision, filling the world. Don\u0027t make me do it, Kaitlyn. I\u0027m not your friend anymore. I\u0027m your hunter. Go home and stay away from Mr. Z and you won\u0027t get hurt.\\n\\n Kaitlyn looked into his handsome pale face. If you want the shard, you\u0027ll have to take it by force.\\n\\n \"Whatever you say,\" Gabriel murmured. His eyes were the color of a spiderweb. Kaitlyn felt the touch of his mind like a searing caress and then the world exploded in pain.\\n\\n Kaitlyn!\"\\n\\n Dimly Kait heard Rob\u0027s shout, felt him struggling to get to his feet. Then, when he couldn\u0027t, beginning to crawl. She could barely sense him for the overwhelming pain in her head.\\n\\n Anna and Lewis were closer and she could hear them shouting, too.\\n\\n \"Let go of her!\"\\n\\n \"What are you doing to her?\"\\n\\n Gabriel brushed them away and kept on doing it. The pain increased-like fire. Kaitlyn had only one memory that would compare to it: being connected to the crystal. The big crystal, the impure one, the one Mr. Zetes used for enhancing psychic powers-and for torture.\\n\\n Waves of red-streaked agony that peaked very quickly and died away just as another wave was coming.\\n\\n Kaitlyn\u0027s own muscle tension held her rigid, standing motionless under it. Kept her from getting away, kept her from screaming. It wasn\u0027t heroism. She didn\u0027t have the air.\\n\\n Stop it, damn you! Stop it!\\n\\n Rob had gotten to her, somehow. His hands were on her, and golden healing energy flooded up to combat the red-streaked anguish. His powers were protecting her.\\n\\n \"Leave her alone,\" Rob said hoarsely, and pulled Kaitlyn away from Gabriel, toward the bed.\\n\\n Gabriel regarded the cleared path in front of him thoughtfully. \"That was all I wanted,\" he murmured.\\n\\n He opened the middle drawer of the mahogany desk and took out the crystal shard.\\n\\n Kaitlyn was gasping for breath. Rob put her down on the bed, one arm still around her protectively. Kait could sense his trembling anger, and the shocked fury of Lewis and Anna-and she was surprised to find that she herself felt very little resentment toward Gabriel. There had been a look in his eyes just before he blasted her-as if he\u0027d had to turn himself off to do it. To squelch his own emotions.\\n\\n Now he turned to face them, and the shard flashed in the bright light of Marisol\u0027s halogen lamp. It was the size and shape of a small unicorn\u0027s horn, a foot Jong, multifaceted. It glittered not like crystal, but like diamond.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not yours,\" Anna said in a low voice. She and Lewis had flanked Rob and Kaitlyn, the four of them presenting a united front to Gabriel. \"The Fellowship gave it to Kait.\"\\n\\n \"The Fellowship,\" Gabriel sneered. \"Those gutless do-gooders. If I\u0027d lived in the old days, I\u0027d have joined a Dark Lodge and hunted them out of existence.\" Not gutless, Kaitlyn thought. Gabriel\u0027s words brought the faces of the Fellowship to her mind: Timon, frail but wise; Mereniang, cool and discerning; LeShan, lynx-eyed and impatient. They were the last survivors of an ancient race, the race that had used the crystals. They didn\u0027t interfere with the affairs of humanity-but they\u0027d made an exception for Kaitlyn\u0027s group. They\u0027d given up their own power to give Kaitlyn a weapon against Mr. Zetes.\\n\\n \"And now Mr. Z is forming a Dark Lodge of his own,\" she said, looking at Gabriel steadily.\\n\\n \"You could call it that. A psychic strike team. And I\u0027m going to lead it,\" Gabriel said negligently, stroking the crystal. That was dangerous, as Kait could have told him. One of the facets cut his finger and he frowned at the drop of blood absently. He seemed to feel no danger from the others; he didn\u0027t even bother to look at them.\\n\\n \"This would have been useless to you anyway,\" he said. \"You were planning to take it to the crystal, right? Put them together and set up a resonance that would shatter both.\"\\n\\n Kaitlyn didn\u0027t know what the scientific theory was. LeShan had told them that this shard would destroy Mr. Z\u0027s crystal, that was all. She watched a drop of Gabriel\u0027s blood fall onto the hardwood floor.\\n\\n \"But to do that, you\u0027d have to get to the crystal,\" Gabriel continued. \"And you can\u0027t. The old man has it under a combination lock-and PK won\u0027t help with that, will it, Lewis? Eight random numbers to guess?\"\\n\\n He sounded almost jolly-and he was right, Kaitlyn knew. Lewis could move objects with his mind using psychokinesis, but that wouldn\u0027t help him figure out a combination.\\n\\n Lewis had flushed slightly, but he didn\u0027t answer\\n\\n Gabriel\u0027s question. Instead he said, \"Is Lydia still in this with you?\"\\n\\n \"Your little sweetheart?\" Gabriel grinned nastily. \"Better give up on her, too. She\u0027s back under her father\u0027s thumb. She never liked you, anyway.\"\\n\\n Pity, Kaitlyn thought. Lydia Zetes was a spy and a traitor, sent by her father to snoop on them as they traveled to Canada to find the Fellowship-but Kaitlyn felt vaguely sorry for her. Being under Mr. Z\u0027s thumb was a fate she wouldn\u0027t wish on anybody.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s like I told Kaitlyn,\" Gabriel said calmly. \"You might as well all go home. You can\u0027t get at the crystal.\\n\\n The police wouldn\u0027t believe you-the old man has them taken care of. He\u0027s taking care of the ones Anna\u0027s parents contacted, too, by the way. And the Fellowship can\u0027t even help themselves. So there\u0027s really no point in you staying. Why don\u0027t you go home before I have to hurt you again?\"\\n\\n Rob had been silent so far-too angry with Gabriel to find words. Now he found them, standing up to face Gabriel directly once again. Kaitlyn didn\u0027t need the web to sense his rage-it was written in every line of his body, in the burning of his golden eyes.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re a traitor,\" he told Gabriel simply. \"And if you won\u0027t join us, we\u0027ll fight you. With everything we\u0027ve got.\"\\n\\n His voice was quiet, but it shook. Not just rage, Kaitlyn thought suddenly. Rob was hurt-he felt personally betrayed. He hadn\u0027t believed Gabriel would hurt Kait-and Gabriel had proved him wrong. It had become a battle between them, Rob and Gabriel, the two in the group who had always fought most fiercely together, felt the most antagonism for each other, taken the positions farthest apart.\\n\\n And who knew how to push each other\u0027s buttons. Rob was going on, his voice not quiet now but rushed and reckless.\\n\\n \"You know what I think? I think Kait was wrong- it\u0027s not the web you can\u0027t stand. It\u0027s not the intimacy.\\n\\n It\u0027s the freedom. Having to make your own choices, be responsible for yourself. That\u0027s what you can\u0027t take. You\u0027d rather be a slave to the crystal than deal with freedom.\"\\n\\n Gabriel lowered the shard, his eyes darkening. Kaitlyn grabbed for Rob\u0027s arm, but he seemed oblivious to her.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m right, aren\u0027t I?\" Rob said, with a short, strange laugh, as if delighted to have hurt Gabriel. It was so vicious and contemptuous it didn\u0027t sound like Rob. \"Mr. Z tells you what to do-and you like that. It\u0027s what you\u0027re used to, after all those years locked up in CHAD. Hell, you probably miss being in jail-\"\\n\\n Gabriel went white and hit him.\\n\\n Not mentally-Kaitlyn had the impression that he was too angry for that. He hit with his fist, catching Rob square in the mouth. Rob\u0027s head jerked back and he went down.\\n\\n With the fluid, easy movements of a predator, Gabriel reached for him again. Kaitlyn found herself on her feet and between them.\\n\\n \"No!\" She fumbled for Gabriel, meaning to restrain him or at least hinder him-and somehow found herself grabbing the crystal. It was cold and hard. She held onto it and Gabriel, still trying to get to Rob, let go.\\n\\n Lewis and Anna were around Gabriel now, seizing any part of him they could reach and clinging. Kaitlyn managed to detach herself from the group and back\\n\\n away, clutching the crystal to her chest. Gabriel didn\u0027t seem to care; his eyes were fixed on Rob. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dark-visions-the-passion-dark-visions-3/page-1.html","bookId":2126,"book":{"id":2126,"title":"Dark Visions: The Passion (Dark Visions #3)","description":"Storyline: The Passion (Dark Visions #3) \\n Kaitlyn Fairchild and her four psychic friends nearly escape from the evil Mr. Zetes - until Gabriel defects to the Institute.
