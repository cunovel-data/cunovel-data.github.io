Trying to prove something to me or to yourself? Or are you asking me to do something about it?”\\n\\n Kevin clenched his fists. “You go to hell.”\\n\\n Richard smiled. “Get down on your hands and knees. Your ass toward me.”\\n\\n “Why? So you can bully me?”\\n\\n “Your choice, baby—the easy way or the hard way?”\\n\\n Kevin hesitated for a long moment while Richard held his breath. It was a total bluff, not because he couldn’t easily handle the smaller man, but because he didn’t want an unwilling partner. He believed Kevin needed this, and had been asking for it all day, but he had to make sure. Then with only a trace of hesitation, Kevin turned his back and dropped to his knees between the bed and the table.\\n\\n Just because he’d obeyed didn’t mean he was happy about it. Every muscle in Kevin’s body was tense and resistant, and he glanced back over his shoulder at Richard and literally snarled at him.\\n\\n Richard smiled, liking the challenge. He sat on the bed for a few more seconds, deciding how to proceed until Kevin growled again. “Damn it, do something. Do you expect me to stay here all night?”\\n\\n “Only if I tell you to,” he replied. He gave him a hard smack on his ass. “Now shut up like a good boy.”\\n\\n Richard stood up and opened his backpack, pulling out a pair of leather cuffs. He walked around to stand in front of Kevin. The second he caught sight of them, he immediately balked, as Richard thought he would. “Hell no, Richard.”\\n\\n Richard had already decided he wasn’t about to give him a choice. Kevin needed someone to take his choices away. “Give me your wrists,” Richard said softly.\\n\\n “Not going to happen.”\\n\\n Richard leaned over and slapped his ass again, hard enough to make him jump. “Are you done? Because we can do this all night if you want to.” Kevin pressed his lips together and looked up at him through a fringe of hair, and the sight of Kevin on his knees in front of him, that sultry, sullen look on his face lit a fire in Richard’s groin. When he lowered his eyes again, Richard knew they were almost there.\\n\\n Richard pulled Kevin’s wrists up and over toward the table leg. He wrapped the cuffs around the table leg and then attached them to his wrists. Kevin could move up and down the leg, but he wasn’t going anywhere else. The table was old, but heavy, made of solid chunks of wood. He watched while Kevin struggled with the idea for a moment, even trying to lever the table up with his shoulder. He could move it, but couldn’t get it off the floor far enough. When he realized he was securely shackled there until Richard decided to let him go, he pulled hard at the cuffs, getting angry. “Let me go, Richard.”\\n\\n “No.”\\n\\n Breathing hard, he turned to look at him. “Please.”\\n\\n “Begging won’t help, baby. You have some apologies to make and a few lessons to learn first.”\\n\\n He came around behind Kevin and jerked him effortlessly to his knees with one hand while the other pushed his shorts down past his knees. He pulled them off all the way, then, leaving him naked below the waist. He took some lube from his back pack and laid it on the floor beside Kevin while he stripped off his own clothes. Still on his knees, Kevin turned to watch him uneasily. “I don’t want this.”\\n\\n “Then tell me to stop. One word and it’s over. Is that what you want, baby?”\\n\\n Kevin turned his head back around, biting on his lower lip. Richard grabbed his chin and turned his face around. “Want me to stop?”\\n\\n Kevin blew out a long breath. “No.”\\n\\n “Then tell me how sorry you are for being such a smartass all day.”\\n\\n “Sorry,” he mumbled.\\n\\n “And for throwing things at me and not even trying to start a fire?”\\n\\n “Okay. I’m sorry, all right?”\\n\\n “Now tell me why you did it.”\\n\\n He raised his head, a look of confusion on his face. “What? I don’t know…I just…”\\n\\n “Just what?”\\n\\n “I was mad, all right?” The sullen, belligerent look was back on his face.\\n\\n “Because you thought I wasn’t giving you enough of my time? Because you wanted my attention, but you didn’t know how to ask me for it?” He splashed some lube over himself. Putting more on both his hands, he wrapped one hand around Kevin’s dick, slowly stroking it from the base to the head, while the other hand went to his crease.\\n\\n Kevin cried out with the overload of sensations, and another look of confusion swept over his face. “I…I don’t know. Please. Please, Richard.”\\n\\n “Please what, baby? That’s it, isn’t it? Because you can’t ask me, can you? That would be admitting you like what I do to you. You like the idea of being under my control. Despite everything, you like it all. Being dominated. Feeling like you have no choice. Feeling like I was neglecting you if I didn’t have you under me. You want me to pay attention to you. You want me to fuck you and take all your choices away, kind of like now, don’t you? That way you’re not to blame for any of it. You’re not staying with me because you want to, but because I’m making you, isn’t that right?” His hand was moving faster, up and down his rigid shaft. Richard bent over and bit him gently on his shoulder, at the same time inhaling that perfect scent. Pleasure and pain, that’s what Kevin wanted, and that’s what he’d give him.\\n\\n Richard was dragging an orgasm out of him, and Kevin threw his head back against his shoulder, groaning and breathing fast. “Then you can go back to your life in Florida and play it safe. You can pretend you like to top all the time, and pretend you’re independent and don’t need anybody. Don’t need me, more than you need to breathe.” He’d been jacking Kevin hard and now he gave a final twist while sticking a finger up his ass and finding his prostate. Kevin screamed and came so hard he was left shaking and trembling in Richard’s grasp.\\n\\n Before he had time to recover, Richard bent him back over on his knees, pushing him down on his elbows, so his ass was right where he wanted it. He entered in one thrust, making Kevin cry out again as he buried himself up to his knot. He put his hand under Kevin’s body and found his softened cock and wrapped his hand around it again, moving the skin up and down, probably painfully now since Kevin had just come. He whimpered, but Richard ignored him. “You almost admitted it to me once,” he said, whispering in Kevin’s ear. “You told me you liked it rough. Is this rough enough for you, baby?”\\n\\n “God, please, Richard.”\\n\\n “Admit it to me first. Admit you like this. For once and for all, tell the damn truth.”\\n\\n Kevin groaned and started to sob, and Richard knew he was close to finally admitting it, finally asking for what he needed without shame or guilt. “Yes,” he whimpered. And then louder, “Yes, I need this. I need you. Please.”\\n\\n Richard thrust hard into him then, over and over until they both came. Afterward, while the aftershocks still shook them both, he lay on top of Kevin and stroked his back, trying to catch his breath. He reached up and released the cuffs and pulled him into his arms. He came willingly, wrapping his arms around Richard’s waist, and hooking a leg over his, pressing his whole body close.\\n\\n When he could talk again, Richard murmured in his ear. “I’m going to mate with you now, Kevin. Are you ready to give yourself to me?”\\n\\n Kevin nodded, burrowing his face into his shoulder.\\n\\n “You know what this means? It’s forever, and I’ll never let you go. You’ll live as long as I do, and you’ll drink my blood from time to time to stay healthy, but that means you can never leave me. We’ll always be together from this point on. You understand?” He pulled Kevin’s face away from his shoulder and stared down at him. His face was smooth and relaxed, and he looked more at peace than Richard had ever seen him.\\n\\n “I understand,” he said softly.\\n\\n “Thank you for giving yourself to me, Kevin. I look on it as a precious gift, and I’ll try never to betray your trust.” He kissed him tenderly and held him close for a while. But he was unable to wait much longer. He’d waited so long already for this time to come.\\n\\n Richard stood up and carried him to the bed. Knowing Kevin was already stretched from their lovemaking, he still lubed him well, and then, turning him over on his side, he sank his teeth deeply into Kevin’s neck, causing him to cry out again. He entered him before his cries died out, easing his way in at first, and then as he met resistance to the knot, pushing harder, maneuvering his hips until he felt it slip in. Kevin gave a hoarse shout and began to have another orgasm immediately, due to the chemicals secreted by the knot and the stimulation to his prostate. Holding and petting him through it, Richard settled himself for a long night.\\n\\n The knot would tie them together for at least an hour or more while Kevin had multiple orgasms. He’d be in heat even after it was over, and he’d have to be patient with him and love him through it. Richard would only be able to hold him close and soothe him. He kissed the back of Kevin’s neck again and held him tightly in his arms, shuddering a little at the realization of how much he meant to him. Kevin held more power over him than he could ever dream of.\\n\\n Richard would care for him always, just like he would tonight. Because he’d finally found his home again, and from this time on, neither of them would ever be alone.\\n\\n Epilogue\\n\\n Sitting on the edge of the little stream, Kevin laughed as he saw Richard’s gaze shift toward him and held up both hands. “No, please, don’t even think of pulling me in. It’s too cold!”\\n\\n Richard smiled at him. “Don’t worry. I have no intention of scaring away the fish.” He held up a string of trout. “Although, I probably do have enough for dinner tonight.” He waggled his eyebrows up and down and came toward him, but Kevin jumped up and ran up the bank.\\n\\n “Stop right there,” he pleaded, his back against a big tree. “These are the only dry clothes I have left.” \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/twice-in-a-blue-moon-dark-hollow-wolf-pack-8/page-24.html","bookId":2260,"book":{"id":2260,"title":"Twice in a Blue Moon (Dark Hollow Wolf Pack #8)","description":"Storyline: Twice in a Blue Moon (Dark Hollow Wolf Pack #8) \\n When Detective Kevin Bryson’s partner, Tucker, disappears into the mountains of Tennessee with only a phone call telling Kevin not to worry about him, Kevin can’t leave it alone.
