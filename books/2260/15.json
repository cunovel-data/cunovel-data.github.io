Why don’t you tell me what it is, sweet boy?” Chapter Six “Shit, you scared me to death. Why the hell were you sitting here in the dark? Don’t you ever knock?” Kevin scooted up in bed to sit with his back against the headboard. Richard’s deep voice rumbled in the dark room. “It isn’t dark. Not really. And I did, but you weren’t in here. So I came in to wait for you. Actually, I’m here to apologize.” Kevin snorted. “You? Apologize? I must not have heard you correctly.” “I shouldn’t have been so short with you downstairs. It wasn’t your fault that Derek came over to you. Even with my scent all over you, I guess he couldn’t resist.” “God, I hope I didn’t smell that bad. I was sitting right next to Tucker, and he never said anything.” “Tucker wouldn’t have noticed.” “But that boy would have from across the room? You and your cryptic comments.” Richard stood and came over to the bed to sit on the side. Kevin pulled the sheet higher on his chest, uneasy at Richard’s proximity. “Okay, apology accepted, but I need to sleep.” Richard stretched out his arm and Kevin felt his fingers trail gently along his jaw. “I need to claim you soon,” he said, almost as if he were talking to himself. Kevin leaned into his touch, craving it, hating himself for needing it so much. “What about what I need?” “Tell me what that is, baby,” Richard said softly. “I-I need to get out of here, to go home.” “I know.” Richard’s hand moved down to his shoulders, massaging, stroking, making him ache even more in his groin. He dropped his head back on the headboard. Richard’s hand moved down to his nipples, gently circling each one, one thumb rubbing over the small nub. “I know all that, sweet boy. But what do you want me to do for you right now?” “I don’t want you to do anything.” Richard’s hand stilled, and he raised one eyebrow as he pulled his hand away. Unable to bear it, Kevin grabbed for it and pulled it back to his chest, his breathing quickening. Kevin shook his head, tightening his grip on Richard’s hand. He couldn’t put it into words. He just had this aching need inside him that he wanted filled. It had always been there, throughout every encounter with every man, all of his life. No matter how much sex he had, it was never quite enough. Today, in the woods, was the closest he’d ever come to fulfillment. He wanted, he needed more. “I-I want it rough. I want you to take me. To make me like it.” Something blazed in Richard’s eyes for just a moment before his lashes fell to cover the spark. His voice, low and sexy in the quiet room, sent chills through Kevin’s body. “I won’t hurt you…” Kevin’s breath hitched, and he nodded, letting his hands fall away from Richard’s and gripping the sheets beneath him. He was almost ready to beg, but he pressed his lips together, swallowing the things he wanted to say. Then Richard’s voice came again. “What I will do is turn you over my lap and spank your pretty ass until it pinks up under my hand, until you squirm and beg me to stop, until you’re coming on my thighs, because you can’t help yourself. Then I’ll turn you over on this bed and fuck you so hard you forget your own name. So hard you’ll plead with me to stop, but I won’t. Until I think you’ve had enough. All you have to do,” he leaned over and whispered in Kevin’s ear, his hot breath sending waves of pleasure through his body. “All you have to do is ask for it.” “Oh, God…” His heart was beating wildly at the image that sprang into his mind. His body spread out across another man’s knees. The humiliation, the pain, the loss of control. “Oh God, please.” “That’s what I thought.” Richard pulled Kevin across his lap as if he were a child, his ass in the air. Despite what he said he wanted, now that the reality was here, he panicked and struggled, trying to get up. A strong hand held him down, held him in place. He knew that if he cried out and told Richard to stop, he would. That was why Richard was hesitating, waiting for Kevin to find his balance, to be sure. Richard rubbed his hands over the globes of his ass, soothing what he intended to spank in just seconds. “Ready?” Kevin took a deep breath and nodded, and then Richard’s hand came down on his bare skin hard twice in succession. The heat from his face quickly transferred itself to his ass, and he bucked his body as the hand fell again and again. His cock lay against the rough material of Richard’s jeans, and as his balls tightened, he rubbed frantically against his thighs. Richard never relented, never gave him a chance to get used to it, to get ready for the next one before the hand fell again. His hips began to writhe, his body well aware of what it wanted, what it needed from this man. His cock was engorged with blood, and he was becoming mindless. He felt himself arching like a cat, trying to turn to watch the hand as it came down on him, but the hand on his back was relentless, pushing him back down and making him take it. He could hear the choked cries coming from his throat, hardly able to breathe for the sensations that were rocking his body, the pain and the pleasure coming in equal measures so fast it was overwhelming him. He cried out then as his orgasm gripped him and he thrust his legs straight out behind him, convulsing on Richard’s lap. Richard’s hand tightened around his waist as he spurted all over his belly and Richard’s thighs. “Good boy,” Richard said, as he slapped his ass one more time. “Tell me how that felt.” “I-I…” “Tell me it was good then, baby.” “It was good.” “This will be better.” He picked Kevin up off his thighs as if he weighed almost nothing and laid him face down on the bed. Trying to breathe again, Richard picked up his head and looked at him over his shoulder. He was stripping off his clothes, his eyes never leaving Kevin. “Get on your knees.” Slowly Kevin got in the position Richard told him to, his knees trembling. He couldn’t come again so soon. He would do this because…because Richard told him to. He spread his knees wide and laid his head on the mattress, his ass high in the air. He could feel Richard behind him, stroking his hips, his back. Richard leaned over him and his voice rumbled in his ear. “The first time I saw you in that hotel room, I wanted to spread you out like this, for my pleasure. I wanted to spank you first for that smart mouth, and then lay you down and make you open yourself to me. Would you have liked that, Kevin?” His fingers were spreading him at his crease, and he nodded, not knowing if Richard could even see it, but it was hard to form words. He liked the things Richard was saying to him, but it made him feel strangely needy and wanton, embarrassed. He turned to bury his face in the mattress, and Richard chuckled. “Sweet boy.” He heard Richard fumble at the table beside him and then he jerked in surprise as cool liquid hit him in his most intimate place. He half raised his body up, but Richard’s hand was there, smoothing it in place, making him groan and shiver. The blunt head of Richard’s cock brushed against his hole and he cried out. Richard’s hand soothed him again, rubbing his ass cheeks and murmuring to him. Kevin could feel pre-cum dripping from his cock that had somehow become half-hard again. He’d never started to get hard so soon after an orgasm that strong. What was this man doing to him? A finger entered him, strong and sure, sweeping inside and stretching him. It brushed his prostate and he jumped. Another finger slipped in and he heard himself groaning with pleasure. Three of Richard’s fingers were in his ass, twisting and spreading. Then a strong, warm hand went around his shaft. “Fuck yourself in my hand, baby. Show me how much you want it.” “Richard, please…” “Please what? What is it you need, baby?” “I-I need you.” “Then show me.” The fingers in his ass slipped away, replaced by the head of Richard’s cock, huge and blunt. He pushed it inside and Kevin gasped before his body responded, opening to him, letting him in. He pushed all the way in until Kevin could feel something hard, his balls maybe, crowding his ass, and then he stopped, just filling him, but not moving. “Your turn, baby. Show me how much you want this. Fuck yourself on my cock until you come in my hand.” “Oh, God…” “Do it. If this is what you want, show me.” Slowly he pushed himself forward into Richard’s hand. The pressure on his cock felt so good, he never wanted it to stop, but he needed to move. He pushed himself back on Richard’s cock and felt the tingling on his prostate and he moaned aloud, grinding himself on that cock that felt so good inside him. He heard Richard’s sharp intake of breath and smiled to himself, knowing he wasn’t the only one about to lose control. Suddenly, that became his goal, to make Richard lose control too. To make him cry out Kevin’s name and come so hard he lost himself. He pushed back up into his hand and then slammed back into Richard. He did it over and over again, no longer thinking, just feeling the mindless pleasure, and he heard Richard’s groaning. Richard took over then, taking the control away from him, and he was taking him hard, filling him with his big cock and stretching him until he was panting for breath, but he liked it. It satisfied him in a way no one had ever done before. Lust filled his head, and his eyes glazed over, and all he could do was feel as Richard pounded him into the mattress. He gave up his efforts then and just allowed it to happen. He was no longer in control of anything—he was just along for the ride, and he realized that was just the way he’d wanted it all along. His orgasm slammed into him like a freight train, knocking him off track, shaking him to his core. He came harder than he’d ever come in his life, the orgasm he’d had as he lay across Richard’s lap felt like foreplay compared to this. He was boneless, destroyed, mindless. He was vaguely aware of Richard’s release and him sagging down on top of him and then rolling them both to the side, but he was too wiped out to even open his eyes. The pleasure came again, like an aftershock, and he shivered and leaned back into the warmth of Richard’s chest. He felt lips brush his ear and smiled in contentment as he drifted gently down into the welcoming darkness.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/twice-in-a-blue-moon-dark-hollow-wolf-pack-8/page-15.html","bookId":2260,"book":{"id":2260,"title":"Twice in a Blue Moon (Dark Hollow Wolf Pack #8)","description":"Storyline: Twice in a Blue Moon (Dark Hollow Wolf Pack #8) When Detective Kevin Bryson’s partner, Tucker, disappears into the mountains of Tennessee with only a phone call telling Kevin not to worry about him, Kevin can’t leave it alone.
