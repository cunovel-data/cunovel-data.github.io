Are you guys in some kind of three-way?” Richard’s reaction was immediate. He jumped up from the chair, his face dull red, his mouth open in surprise. His hands shot out and shoved Kevin hard on his chest, knocking him back on the bed. Kevin scrambled back to his feet, throwing the sheet down in his fury. He took a step forward and shoved back, putting everything he had into it, all his fear and his rage. Richard stumbled backward, his big body mostly absorbing the shock, but Kevin was gratified to see he’d surprised him. Richard stood still for a moment, seeming to gather himself, taking in deep breaths and clenching his fists. In seconds, his face was smooth and calm again, and Kevin could see that he’d mastered the flash of anger his words had caused. Suddenly, he didn’t want Richard to be so in charge of his feelings anymore. He wanted him to experience the same savage passion and rage he was feeling. He sneered at him, taunting him deliberately. “What’s the matter, Richard? Afraid your little secret will get out? Doesn’t Gavin know about you and Tucker? Are you two sneaking around behind his back? How does it feel to have your cock up that sweet little ass? Or does he put his dick up yours? Is that what you like?” “Shut your mouth!” He reached for Kevin, who put his hands up defensively, expecting to be hit in the face. Richard grabbed his wrists instead, and they struggled, each determined to get the upper hand. As they scuffled back and forth, Kevin trying his best to break Richard’s incredibly strong hold on his wrists, Kevin was slammed back into the wall by the bed, and Richard forced his hands above his head. They were almost nose to nose, and once again, he was almost overwhelmed by Richard’s scent, which was teasing him and making him foggy with desire. “Don’t talk shit you don’t know anything about! What you’re saying is disgusting!” Richard yelled. “Why? Because Tucker is a man? You’re not into men, is that it? Or you just think you’re not? It wouldn’t be the first time a straight guy wanted to have a little something on the side. Tucker’s pretty sweet, isn’t he?” “Shut up!” Richard kept his tight hold on his wrists, and bent to take Kevin’s mouth in a punishing kiss. At first he practically ground his lips against Kevin’s, but when Kevin reacted instinctively and parted his lips, he stopped his rough assault, just holding his lips against his, breathing hard into his mouth. The next second, Kevin heard a low growling sound coming from his throat, and he was licking gently at his lips. Kevin opened his own mouth farther and tentatively pushed out the tip of his tongue to meet Richard’s. Richard swept his tongue over Kevin’s and thrust inside his mouth. Kevin let out a low moan as his body betrayed him. He could no longer concentrate on anything except the man’s tongue sweeping over the inside of his mouth, the heat making his balls draw up and his cock thicken. He couldn’t catch his breath and the bastard holding him wasn’t letting up. He thrashed his head from side to side, trying to escape, but Richard only laughed and put up one hand to hold his chin, while the other hand effortlessly held both of Kevin’s wrists against the wall. His laugh was a low, throaty rumble that made Kevin’s balls tighten to the point of pain. He kissed him until Kevin’s lips felt raw and only when he sensed Kevin’s surrender did he slowly withdraw, giving his lips a final little lick. It was scary how easily he controlled him, and Kevin slowly became aware of how very naked he was. He froze when Richard’s large hand grasped his cock. For a long moment they simply stared at each other, the intimacy of standing so close with Kevin’s cock in this virtual stranger’s grip made his knees almost collapse. When Kevin glanced down to stare at the hand wrapped tightly around him, Richard’s voice rasped at him. “Look at me.” Kevin obeyed, feeling almost compelled. “Do you want me, Kevin? If you want this, all you have to do is nod. Just tilt your head up and back down.” He blew softly in his ear. “That’s all it takes.” “No! I don’t want any of this. I didn’t want you kissing me, and I don’t want your hand on me either!” “Really?” Richard leaned forward, his own breathing fast and hot in Kevin’s ear. “Is that why you were moaning in my mouth just now? Is that why you’re so hard?” Kevin’s legs were trembling. Why couldn’t he just tell him to fuck off? Strangely, he wasn’t frightened of him, even though he was holding him so tightly. Kevin had a feeling he wouldn’t hurt him. He raised his eyes to Richard’s and caught his steady gaze. Richard’s lips curved up in a beautiful smile. “That’s right. Look at me. Can you see how much I want you? You’re so goddamned beautiful. All you have to do is ask me to pleasure you.” Kevin took a deep, shaky breath. God knew he wanted it. It had been a long time since he’d been so attracted to anyone, since anyone’s hand had felt so good. Holding Richard’s gaze, he nodded his head slowly up and down. Richard smiled at him in triumph and slowly pumped his dick in his hand, never taking his eyes off him. “Feel good?” he whispered, leaning down to lick the corner of his mouth. Kevin flicked his gaze up at him, and Richard responded by holding that gaze, his grip on Kevin incredibly firm and hot. Kevin heard himself whimper as the hand sped up, the pressure increasing. He pumped him slowly up and down, only gradually increasing the speed and the tempo. His thumb grazed over the leaking tip of Kevin’s cock and he smeared the pre-cum over the sensitive head. Kevin was so close he thought he was about to embarrass himself by coming so soon. He slammed his head back against the wall to distract himself, but Richard followed him and took his mouth again, pressing those warm, full lips against his, his tongue flicking out to lick at the corners of his mouth. Then without warning, he flicked his thumb down into the sensitive slit and squeezed. Kevin threw back his head and his orgasm raced through him, the hot cum pulsing from his body in long streams. He was coming in Richard’s hand, helpless to prevent it, and the man smiled down at him, capturing his groans in his mouth. “That’s right, come on.” Richard continued to milk his cock for every drop until his grip became painful and Kevin was sagging. Only then did he release him and catch him around the waist when he would have fallen. He put him back on the side of the bed. “Sit still,” he said softly. He disappeared through one of the two doors in the room and when turned on the light, Kevin could see it was a bathroom. Kevin heard the water running. He came back in only a few minutes with a cloth, while Kevin was still trying to catch his breath. Kevin reached for the cloth, but Richard shook his head and pushed his hand away, cleaning Kevin himself. He made him spread his legs while he washed him thoroughly, to Kevin’s hot embarrassment and then draped the sheet back over his lap, looking into Kevin’s eyes. “Sweet boy,” he said, and moved his hands so they were trailing across Kevin’s shoulders. Finally, he let him go and crossed back over to the window. When the silence dragged out to the point where it became excruciating, Richard finally spoke. “I’m sorry I shoved you before. I didn’t mean to hurt you. I don’t why you make me so…” he stopped in mid-sentence, looking up at the ceiling as if to find an answer there. Finally he started again. “Did I hurt you?” Kevin shook his head, still unwilling to look at him. “What you said about me and Tucker…it’s not true. Tucker is my…Tucker is a relative. A close relative and what you said made me…” “I was just popping off. I didn’t really believe it,” he said grudgingly. Richard stood for another few moments, and Kevin could almost feel the restlessness radiating off him. Finally he spoke. “I have to go, but Tucker will be in to bring you something to eat, and I’ll be back later. You’ll be seeing a lot of me until…” Kevin darted a glance up at him, and he smiled, shaking his head. “Relax for now. Try to get some rest, and Tucker will be in soon.” He strode toward the door, not even glancing back at him once before he left the room. Kevin looked down at his traitorous cock, “A fat lot of help you were…” he muttered, wishing he’d never come on this crazy rescue mission, wishing he could just close his eyes and fade away, escaping this room, this situation and the crazy attraction he was feeling for a man who could so easily eat him alive. Chapter Three He was still sitting on the side of the bed a few minutes later when a soft knock came at the door and it opened slowly. Tucker came in alone, holding some clothes folded in his hand. He stood just inside the door for a long moment, as if unsure of his welcome. He seemed nervous and uneasy. Kevin sighed. “If those are for me, give them to me. It’s cold in here, and I’m freezing.” Tucker looked concerned and turned first to the controls on the wall, giving them a turn. “I’m sorry, I didn’t realize.” He brought the clothes over to him. “I didn’t have any pants that would fit you, but I brought some shorts, and a shirt. You’re a little bigger than me, but I think they’ll fit.” “What about my things? I saw him bring in my suitcase.” “Oh. Well, they’ve been taken away, Kevin. You know, in case there was any kind of tracking device or anything.” “In my clothes? God, I’m not James Bond.” “I know, but they’re being really cautious.” He stuck his hands down in his pockets and rocked back and forth on his heels nervously. “I, uh…I guess you’re pretty pissed off at me.” “Shouldn’t I be?” Kevin stood up, letting the sheet fall and noticed how Tucker averted his gaze. That was new. He’d never been hesitant to look at him before in the locker room at the gym or the couple of times they’d gone swimming in the nude late at night on the beach outside his parents’ condo. He pulled on the clothes Tucker had brought him quickly, half afraid Richard might come back in the room.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/twice-in-a-blue-moon-dark-hollow-wolf-pack-8/page-7.html","bookId":2260,"book":{"id":2260,"title":"Twice in a Blue Moon (Dark Hollow Wolf Pack #8)","description":"Storyline: Twice in a Blue Moon (Dark Hollow Wolf Pack #8) When Detective Kevin Bryson’s partner, Tucker, disappears into the mountains of Tennessee with only a phone call telling Kevin not to worry about him, Kevin can’t leave it alone.
