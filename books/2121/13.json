{"id":93367,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"\"I thought you\u0027d forgotten.\" Schuyler smiled as she removed her raincoat and hung it on the hook. She had just entered the apartment with her key. A key she kept on a silk ribbon around her neck. She never took it off, for fear that it would be stolen. She\u0027d entered the building in the normal fashion. Had a polite word with the guard. Headed up in the elevator, exchanging pleasantries with the neighbors. Cooed at their baby bundled inside a fleece-lined thousand-dollar stroller. Pretended she was just like them. No more vampire tricks for one evening. \"Have you been waiting long?\" she asked. \"I just got here.\" He was standing against a column, his arms crossed in front of him. He was still wearing the same white shirt from that morning, a little crumpled at the end of the day, and he had loosened his tie, letting it fall to the side. But he was still golden and gorgeous. His sea green eyes danced with amusement and desire. Jack Force. The boy she had been waiting to see all evening. The boy she had been waiting for all her life. She wanted to run to him - to skip, giggling into his arms - but she savored the way he was looking at her. She could drown in the intensity of his gaze. And she had learned a little about seduction in the last few weeks they had been together. Had learned that it was sweeter when she made him wait. So she took her time, removed her shoes, brushed her bare feet on the carpet, and let him watch her. Outside of this place, they could be nothing to each other. He would not even allow himself to look at her. He could not afford it. So she wanted him to enjoy himself, to look at her as much as he liked. \"Get over here,\" he growled. And then, at last, she ran - leaped into his arms, and together they crashed against the wall in a tight embrace. He lifted her with graceful ease, covering her body with kisses. She tightened her legs around his torso and bent over, brushing his cheek with the tendrils of her hair. Jack. She felt liquid in his arms. Pressed against him, his heart beating wildly in time with hers. When they kissed, she closed her eyes and saw a million colors bursting in the air, glorious and alive. He smelled earthy and lush, warm and brutish. It had been a surprise: she\u0027d assumed he would smell like ice - like nothing - and she liked that he smelled coarse and real. He was not a dream. She knew that what they were doing was wrong. Lawrence had warned her that vampire bonds should not be broken. Jack was sworn to another. She had promised herself to stop, but she had also promised Jack she would always be there for him. They were so happy together. They belonged to each other. Yet they never spoke about the past or the future. Only this existed, this little bubble they\u0027d made, this little secret. And who knew how long they had? When she was in his arms, she felt sorry for Mimi. It had started right after she\u0027d settled into that palace of gilt and marble the Forces called home. The place was part fortress and part Versailles. There were rooms and anterooms filled with magnificent antiques polished and theatrically lit on display. Oceans of expensive fabric swathed the windows, and a silent crew of servants moved around the house, dusting, cleaning, offering its occupants tea or coffee on silver service trays. She had sat on the princess bed in her designated room, kicking at the battered trunk that was the only remnant of home she\u0027d allowed herself to bring. Lawrence had promised that he would get her out somehow, that she would return to her rightful home soon. He knew Charles would not allow him to have contact with her, so they had agreed they would use Oliver as a (she smiled a little) conduit between them. Lawrence had driven her to the Forces\u0027 town house himself. Had helped carry her bags to the front door, where a gloved butler took over. Too soon, her grandfather had left, and Schuyler was alone again. Charles had given her a quick tour of the house: the sparkling Olympic-size pool in the basement, tennis courts on the roof, the gym, the sauna, the Picasso room (so called because it contained one of the two mural-size black-and-white studies of the masterpiece Les Demoiselles d\u0027Avignon). He\u0027d told her to make herself comfortable, to avail herself of everything in the kitchen. Then he\u0027d laid down his rules. Schuyler had been too angry and annoyed to do more than dumbly nod at everything. So she\u0027d decided to kick her trunk. Stupid trunk. Stupid trunk with the broken lock. Stupid ugly trunk that was one of the few things she\u0027d kept that her mother had owned. It was an old Louis Vuitton traveling valise, the kind that, when stood upright and opened, revealed a mini wardrobe. She kicked it again. There was a soft knock on the door, and then the door was pushed open. \"Do you think you could...um...keep it down a bit? I\u0027m trying to read,\" Jack said, looking bemused. \"Oh! Sorry.\" She stopped kicking the trunk. She\u0027d wondered when she\u0027d see her cousins. The complicated ties of vampire families still eluded her, but she knew that she and Jack weren\u0027t technically blood-related, even though Charles was her uncle. Someday she\u0027d have to ask Lawrence how it all shook down. \"What are you reading?\" \"Camus,\" he said, holding up a copy of The Stranger. \"Have you read it?\" \"No, but I like The Cure song. You know, the one that\u0027s based on that book?\" He shook his head. \"Nope.\" \"I think it\u0027s on Three Imaginary Boys. Their first album. Robert Smith, he\u0027s a big reader too. Probably an existentialist like you,\" she teased. Jack leaned against the wall and crossed his arms, regarding her thoughtfully. \"You hate it here, don\u0027t you?\" \"Does it show that much?\" Schuyler asked, pulling the long sleeves of her sweater over her hands. He chuckled. \"I\u0027m sorry.\" \"You\u0027re sorry.\" He put the book down on a vanity table. \"It\u0027s not so bad.\" \"Really? What\u0027s good about it?\" \"Well, for one, I\u0027m here,\" he said, coming over to sit next to her on the bed. He picked up a tennis ball that had rolled out of her trunk. She\u0027d brought it to practice her vampire lessons. Lawrence wanted her to concentrate on the ability to move objects in the air, something she had yet to master. Jack threw it in the air, catching it deftly. Then he put it down. \"Unless, you know, you want me to go.\" He was sitting so close to her. She remembered how she\u0027d run to him the first night she was attacked, how passionate he\u0027d been about discovering the truth about Croatan, and then how deeply he\u0027d disappointed her when he\u0027d brushed her aside. And then she remembered something else. Something she couldn\u0027t stop thinking about ever since she\u0027d drawn Mimi\u0027s blood and absorbed her memories. \"You were the one - that night of the masquerade ball - it was you who...\" Schuyler whispered, and in answer to her question, he kissed her. The kiss was the third one they\u0027d exchanged (she kept count), and as he breathed into her and cupped her face in his broad hands, everything in her life up until then seemed secondary and ordinary. There was nothing to live for but this pure, heavenly sensation. The first time they\u0027d kissed, she had glimpsed Jack\u0027s memories of a girl who looked like her but was not her. The second time, she\u0027d had no idea he was the one behind the mask, but this time it was just the two of them. Jack wasn\u0027t kissing someone he thought he\u0027d known before, and Schuyler wasn\u0027t kissing someone she didn\u0027t know. They were simply kissing each other. \"Jaaaack! Jaaaaack!\" \"Mimi,\" Jack said. He disappeared so fast out of the room it was as if he had turned invisible. When Mimi poked her head into Schuyler\u0027s room, she was sitting by herself kicking the trunk again. \"Oh. You. Have you seen Jack?\" Schuyler shook her head. \"By the way, don\u0027t get too comfortable around here. I have no idea why Father wants a little creep like you around, but here\u0027s some advice: keep out of my way.\" Later that night, Schuyler had received two different welcome presents: someone had short-sheeted her bed, and there was a book slipped under her door. A copy of The Plague by Albert Camus. Inside the book was an envelope, and inside the envelope, there was a key. From then on, Jack never acknowledged her presence at the house or at school. But he had more than made up for it later. \"Where\u0027d you get this?\" Jack asked, tracing a cut on her forehead with a light finger. They were lying on the thick shag carpet, gazing at the remnants of the fire. \"Oh. It\u0027s nothing. Banged my head,\" Schuyler said. She didn\u0027t want to tell him about Dylan just yet. \"Were you followed?\" \"Yes. But I made sure she left before I got here,\" he said. His voice was sleepy, and she nestled in the crook of his arm. The streetlights were the only light in the room, but she could see him clearly in the dark. His perfect profile, as if sculpted in marble, glowed like a candle. \"You?\" \"No.\" In reality she had not checked. She had been too busy talking Oliver into leaving. Too busy and too excited. Because she had known, hadn\u0027t she? She had known Jack would be there, waiting for her, as she had waited for him earlier. But yes, next time she would be more careful. They would both have to be.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/revelations-blue-bloods-3/page-13.html","bookId":2121,"book":{"id":2121,"title":"Revelations (Blue Bloods #3)","description":"Storyline: Revelations (Blue Bloods #3) Have you ever wondered what secrets lurk behind the closed doors of New York City’s wealthiest families?
