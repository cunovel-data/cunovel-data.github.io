She\u0027d been in the middle of a two-hour cardio session before heading to the Force Tower. She hadn\u0027t had time to change or look presentable. Her hair was still sticking to her sweaty forehead. \"Forsyth picked me up from school, and when he got the summons, he brought me with him,\" Bliss told her. \"What\u0027s happened?\" \"Your dad didn\u0027t tell you?\" Mimi hesitated, using a terry-cloth wristband to wipe the dampness on her cheek. \"Something to do with a golden sword?\" Bliss asked. Mimi shrugged without confirming Bliss\u0027s guess. She was especially annoyed with Bliss, whom she\u0027d always assumed to be more of an also-ran rather than a homecoming queen in the grand scheme of things. Yet the city\u0027s machers and arbiters of fashion couldn\u0027t seem to get enough of the russet-haired Amazon. After opening the Rolf Morgan show, Bliss had booked more advertising campaigns than ever. Her face was everywhere - on billboards, on top of taxicabs. She was inescapable. Mimi would forgive sudden fame and glory - God knows that\u0027s what everyone in New York was after - but she couldn\u0027t forgive Bliss for choosing sides, especially since it was the wrong one. Everyone at school knew Bliss and Schuyler were besties. Mimi found it insulting that Bliss, a girl who wouldn\u0027t have had a social leg to stand on in Duchesne without Mimi\u0027s blessing, had turned her back on the in-crowd to hang with the ragged little group of misfits. She didn\u0027t want to share her information, but the opportunity to lord her insider status over her former friend was too much for Mimi to resist. \"It\u0027s Michael\u0027s sword,\" she explained. \"The Blade of Justice.\" \"What about it?\" \"It\u0027s missing. Charles called the meeting as soon as he discovered it was gone.\" Mimi had arrived at the Conclave to find her father at the head of the table. Charles had been furious. He was certain someone on the Conclave had taken it, and had begun the assembly by accusing several members of robbery. Bliss looked around at the Elders, who were leaving the meeting in whispering groups. \"Why is it important?\" \"Duh. Don\u0027t you remember? It\u0027s the Archangel\u0027s sword. It\u0027s only one of two in the world. Gabrielle has the other, of course - you know, Allegra - but no one knows where it disappeared to when she went AWOL. It\u0027s been lost for decades. But Charles\u0027s, Michael\u0027s ... he kept it in a blood-lock in his study. But someone broke in. It\u0027s gone. He\u0027s sure the Croatan have it,\" Mimi explained. The blood-lock was the most powerful security the Blue Bloods had in their arsenal. Only the blood of an Archangel could open the case. It was an impossible puzzle. With Allegra in a coma, there were no other suspects. \"What\u0027s it got to do with the Silver Bloods?\" Bliss wanted to know, as she sucked on the bandage covering her thumb. She\u0027d woken up one morning to find it bleeding. Odd. Maybe she\u0027d gotten a splinter in her sleep? \"Only an Archangel\u0027s sword can kill another Archangel. I can\u0027t believe you don\u0027t know that, Bliss,\" Mimi scolded. \"Haven\u0027t you been doing the reading?\" \"But why would Charles want to kill Allegra?\" \"Not Allegra. God, do I have to spell everything out? If Lucifer is out there - you know? The High Prince of Darkness? Lucifer\u0027s a former Archangel. It\u0027s the only thing that can kill him. Normal Blue Blood swords - you get them before you\u0027re bonded, by the way, or don\u0027t you remember that either? Those just work against any old Silver Blood. But Michael\u0027s sword is the only one that can kill Lucifer.\" \"And now it\u0027s gone.\" \"Yeah. It sucks. Charles is really losing it if the sword slipped from his care,\" Mimi sighed. It truly looked bad for her father. She could sense that there were members of the Conclave who were suspicious of this \"break-in.\" But why would Charles steal his own sword? Did they actually believe Michael, Pure of Heart, would consort with Silver Bloods? Bliss looked around for her father. Forsyth was still in the room, probably talking to Charles. \"So who do they think stole it?\" \"They have no idea; although Charles said Kingsley was the last person who visited him in his study. I know they should never have trusted that loser. Anyway, Kingsley\u0027s team is incommunicado in Rio. They couldn\u0027t get him on the telepath. And Lawrence hasn\u0027t been checking in either. It\u0027s chaos,\" Mimi said a tad gleefully. \"I hope they don\u0027t think Dylan\u0027s behind it. He can\u0027t be,\" Bliss said nervously. \"What are you talking about?\" Mimi asked. \"Dylan? Why would he be involved? Didn\u0027t he disappear on you a few months ago? He\u0027s like, history.\" Mimi dimly remembered the story of how Dylan had broken into Bliss\u0027s window before being taken by a Silver Blood. Bliss had been inconsolable for days, and Mimi had tried to comfort Bliss by reminding her that the monster could have taken her too. She was lucky to be alive. The Conclave had sent a team to investigate and track down Dylan\u0027s whereabouts, but the Venators had found nothing. \"Don\u0027t you know?\" Bliss asked. \"Know what?\" \"Dylan\u0027s back and he\u0027s in rehab.\" \"Are you sure we\u0027re talking about the same guy. Dylan - your deadbeat ex and the guy who killed Aggie? Who got turned into a Silver Blood?\" Mimi demanded. Bliss wasn\u0027t the sharpest knife in the drawer. A girl who was still wearing last season\u0027s sack dresses in May was totally clueless, as far as Mimi was concerned. \"Yeah.\" \"Why would I know about it?\" Mimi asked. \"You\u0027re on the Conclave. I turned him in to Forsyth. He said he would let the Conclave know, so that everyone could make a decision. He said the Elders decided to send him to Transitions.\" Mimi shook her head, looking mystified. \"No. Your dad never mentioned it in a meeting. We did no such thing.\" She looked at Bliss like she was out of her mind. How strange that Forsyth would keep something like that a secret from the Conclave. \"That\u0027s odd, why would he lie to me?\" \"Who knows?\" Mimi studied Bliss. \"Dylan\u0027s really back? You\u0027re sure?\" Bliss nodded. \"We visited him the other week.\" \"Take me to him. I\u0027ll let Forsyth know I need to make a report on Dylan for the Conclave.\" Cordelia Van Alen Files Repository of History CLASSIFIED DOCUMENT: Altithronus Clearance Only Cordelia. - I trust you will find this satisfactory.
