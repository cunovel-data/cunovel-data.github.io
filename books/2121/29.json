Dress him in a red suit and send him down the chimney, Bliss thought, not quite trusting to put her faith in the awkward human, even though he was a very prominent hematologist and came from an old Red Blood family of trusted Conduits.\n \"My secretary tells me you are friends of Dylan Ward. I know you\u0027ve been trying to get in touch with me. I apologize for the delay in responding. It\u0027s been a very busy week. Someone snuck a familiar into one of the dorms, and it was almost a bloodbath.\" He winced. \"But not to worry, everything\u0027s under control for now.\" The doctor smiled.\n \"Right.\" Bliss nodded and took a seat across from his desk. \"We\u0027re his friends. Thank you for seeing us.\"\n \"I\u0027m not a friend. I\u0027m here to find out what\u0027s going on with him for the Conclave,\" Mimi snapped. \"I\u0027m a Warden.\"\n He raised his eyebrow. \"You look young for your age.\"\n Mimi smirked. \"When you think about it, we all do.\"\n \"I mean, for someone in your position,\" he said nervously, coughing and shuffling papers on his desk.\n \"Get to the point, doctor. I didn\u0027t come here to debate the policies of the Conclave. What\u0027s going on with that basket case?\"\n Dr. Andrews opened the file in front of him and grimaced. \"Dylan appears to be suffering from a form of post-traumatic stress disorder. We\u0027ve enrolled him in several regression therapies to help recover his memories. But so far he hasn\u0027t made any real connection to anything. He remembers neither what happened to him a hundred years ago nor what happened to him a month ago.\"\n It was just as Bliss feared. Dylan was like an unmoored boat, anchored to nothing and no one. \"So he\u0027ll just have amnesia like that...forever?\"\n \"Hard to say,\" the doctor said hesitantly. \"We don\u0027t like to foster false hopes.\"\n \"But why,\" Bliss said, feeling extremely agitated, \"why did it happen?\"\n \"The mind does that sometimes; it blanks out everything in order to function. To blunt the force of a recent trauma.\"\n \"He\u0027s been through a lot,\" Bliss whispered.\n \"Silver Blood attack and all.\" Mimi nodded.\n The doctor consulted his chart again. \"That\u0027s the interesting thing. Like I told Senator Llewellyn, as far as we can determine, there are no signs of Silver Blood corruption in his blood. He has been attacked, yes, and badly tortured, but we are skeptical that he has actually performed the Caerimonia on a fellow vampire. He hasn\u0027t completed the process. Or let me make it clear: he hasn\u0027t even begun it.\"\n Bliss started. \"But...\"\n \"That\u0027s ridiculous,\" Mimi said flatly. \"We all know Dylan killed Aggie. She was fully drained. And he was the only suspect. He even confessed to Bliss.\"\n \"He did,\" Bliss agreed.\n Dr. Andrews shook his head. \"Perhaps he\u0027d been deluded, or manipulated into thinking he was one of them. Our findings are quite conclusive.\"\n \"Forsyth knew this? That Dylan was innocent?\" Mimi asked sharply.\n The doctor nodded. \"I called him as soon as the tests came in.\"\n Mimi laughed a sharp, sarcastic laugh. \"If Dylan\u0027s not a Silver Blood and he didn\u0027t take Aggie, that means he probably wasn\u0027t lying when he told me he doesn\u0027t know where the jeans she\u0027d borrowed from me are.\"\n \"What are you talking about?\" Bliss asked, her mind awhirl.\n \"Never mind.\" Mimi shrugged. She stood up, and Bliss followed her lead. \"Thanks very much for meeting us, doctor. You\u0027ve been a great help.\"\n Bliss couldn\u0027t concentrate. Her fingers shook as she buttoned her coat. She bumped her knee into the table and almost tripped.\n Dylan was innocent.\n He was not a Silver Blood nor about to become one.\n He was a victim.\n For months, everyone in the community had believed in Dylan\u0027s guilt in the murder of Aggie Carondolet. That he had dispatched the other victims, attacked Schuyler, and mortally wounded Cordelia. He\u0027d told Bliss himself that he\u0027d done those things. And she\u0027d believed him.\n But what if he\u0027d just been covering up for someone else? What if he\u0027d just been made to think he had been infected?\n And if it hadn\u0027t been Dylan who\u0027d done all these things, then who had? \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/revelations-blue-bloods-3/page-29.html","bookId":2121,"book":{"id":2121,"title":"Revelations (Blue Bloods #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Revelations (Blue Bloods #3) \n Have you ever wondered what secrets lurk behind the closed doors of New York City’s wealthiest families?
