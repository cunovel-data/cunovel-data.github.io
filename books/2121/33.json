{"id":93387,"no":33,"title":"Page 33","content":"Chapter Thirty-three The Copacabana Palace Hotel was one of Mimi\u0027s favorite destinations. She\u0027d traveled to Rio many times for Carnaval and always stayed in the same corner suite. She had no idea why Nan Cutler had brought the Conclave all the way to South America, but she didn\u0027t question it. Besides, it wasn\u0027t as if she was going to pass up the opportunity to miss school. Jack had expressed no interest in accompanying her, and she didn\u0027t press the issue. Once they were bonded, they would travel the world together. She missed him, but she was also excited to be on her own in a new city. She put her towel down on the chaise longue located on the private rooftop terrace outside her room. The Conclave had been invited to dine at Casa Alameida, a villa in the hills, later that evening. The Almeidas had been part of the Blue Blood contingent that had moved to Brazil in 1808, when the Portuguese royal family and many nobles had fled from, rather than fight, the red-blooded conqueror, Napoleon. They moved the seat of the king\u0027s court to the colonies, making Rio the first non-European capital of a European country. Of course, once ensconced they never went back, and declared Brazil independent, and the prince, emperor. But when the country declared itself a republic in 1889, the Blue Bloods of the city retreated and concentrated on what they did best: building museums and art collections, grand hotels, and encouraging the cultural renaissance. Mimi admired what the Brazilian Blue Bloods had done with their city, and reminded herself to invite them all to the Spring Gala. The families should really know each other better, she thought. So many of them lived so far away from each other now. Of course the heads of the various Committees would meet with the Coven\u0027s Elders in New York every year, but otherwise they had almost no contact with each other. She lay facedown on the towel and untied the straps to her bikini top. A muscular pool boy approached, his dark skin and hair striking against his white swimsuit. \"Caipirinha?\" \"Sure.\" Mimi pulled herself up on her elbows and didn\u0027t bother to cover herself. His nonchalant gaze - almost obnoxious really, the way he stared at her chest, excited her senses. She was always on a hunt for a new familiar, and when in Rio... Chapter Thirty-four As far as Bliss was concerned she could stay in Rio forever. All afternoon she\u0027d wandered the city\u0027s beautiful beaches, wearing a swimsuit she\u0027d purchased at the hotel shop when the one she\u0027d brought struck her as way too puritanical for this city. They were staying at the fabulous Fasano Hotel on Ipanema, and although Bliss enjoyed sunning on the roof deck, she\u0027d itched to walk the coast on her own. BobiAnne had asked her to take Jordan with her, and the sisters were having fun swimming in the ocean and people watching. Brazilians wore skimpy bikinis, no matter their shape or size; it was liberating and somewhat appalling at the same time. The American in Bliss believed grandmothers should not wear thongs. Still, she was really starting to enjoy herself, relaxing in the sultry weather and forgetting they were in Rio for some fairly serious stuff. She\u0027d overheard Forsyth talking to Nan Cutler, and it sounded as if Lawrence was in a real mess. Her parents didn\u0027t say anything, but it was obvious they were unsettled and anxious. Forsyth kept snapping at every little thing, and even BobiAnne was on edge. Bliss wondered if Schuyler had any luck contacting him. Bliss hadn\u0027t been able to convince her family to bring Schuyler with them. (\"Absolutely not,\" her father had said. \"She is Charles\u0027s ward and I do not think he will give permission.\") She\u0027d done the next best thing and given Schuyler enough money from her personal account to secure a ticket. Schuyler was probably in the city already, but she was supposed to call Bliss when she got in, and so far Bliss hadn\u0027t heard from her. She hoped Schuyler was all right. Rio wasn\u0027t a place for young girls traveling alone. She tried calling Dylan again, but there was no answer. The two of them had gotten into the habit of talking every night and checking in with each other during the day. She knew when he had yoga, when he had therapy, and what time he ate lunch. It bothered her he hadn\u0027t returned any of her messages. Where was he? She dialed the main number of the center and asked for his counselor. \"Dylan?\" The therapist\u0027s voice was cheerful. \"He was checked out the other day.\" \"Really?\" This was news to Bliss. Dylan hadn\u0027t even mentioned that he was eligible for release. \"Do you know who picked him up?\" \"Let\u0027s see...\" There was a sound of papers shuffling. \"It says here he was discharged to Senator Llewellyn.\" Bliss felt uneasy. Obviously her father had failed to mention any of this to her. Maybe it was time to confront him about what she knew, but the thought of bringing it up with Forsyth made her stomach feel queasy. Dylan would call her when he got a chance, she was sure that he would. She would just have to wait. Next to her Jordan was huddled underneath an umbrella, covered with towels and layers of sunscreen. Bliss mocked her for it - taking out her unease over Dylan by insulting her sister. \"You don\u0027t tan either,\" Jordan retorted. \"Yeah, but I don\u0027t care. I like to burn.\" \"B, can I have a coco juice?\" Jordan asked, pointing to a seller who was hawking the frosty wares. \"Sure.\" Bliss rooted in her bag for her wallet, when everything suddenly went white. She couldn\u0027t see a thing. She was completely blind, even though her eyes were wide open. It was the most unnatural, disturbing feeling - almost as if someone else were seeing through her eyes. As if there were another person inside her head. When her vision returned, she was shaking. \"What just happened?\" she asked Jordan. Jordan\u0027s face was drained of color. \"Your eyes - they were blue.\" Bliss had green eyes, as green as the emerald that glinted around her neck. \"You\u0027re joking.\" Bliss laughed. Jordan looked like she was trying to decide something. Finally she spoke. \"Listen, you have to believe that I didn\u0027t have a choice, okay?\" She grabbed Bliss\u0027s arm. \"What are you talking about?\" Bliss asked, totally confused. Jordan just shook her head, and Bliss was shocked to see her stoic younger sister so close to tears. \"Nothing, it\u0027s nothing.\" Jordan sniffed. Bliss embraced her. \"Take it easy, kid.\" \"Remember that you were truly like a sister to me.\" Jordan whispered so softly that Bliss wondered if she\u0027d really said it or if she was just hearing things. \"Whatever it is you\u0027re worried about, everything\u0027s going to be okay, okay?\" Bliss said, hugging her sister tightly. \"Nothing\u0027s going to happen, I promise.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/revelations-blue-bloods-3/page-33.html","bookId":2121,"book":{"id":2121,"title":"Revelations (Blue Bloods #3)","description":"Storyline: Revelations (Blue Bloods #3) Have you ever wondered what secrets lurk behind the closed doors of New York City’s wealthiest families?
