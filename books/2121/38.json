{"id":93392,"no":38,"title":"Page 38","content":"Mimi chose a gorgeous little Valentino cocktail dress to wear to the dinner party. It was a black-and-white strapless confection, with a tight bodice that accented her tiny waist. A thick black band and a dramatic lace bow added just the right hint of girlish insouciance. She had bought it straight from the couture show and brought it to Brazil, because she knew she would have stiff competition from all those Almeidas and da Limas and Ribeiros - annoyingly beautiful Brazilians with blockbuster wardrobes. She still didn\u0027t understand what they were all doing in Rio. Something about Lawrence, of course. And Kingsley she wasn\u0027t sure. Nan Cutler, that wrinkled hag, had been a little vague about the whole thing. But that was the way of the Conclave: they didn\u0027t question their leaders. Nan Cutler was Regent, and if she wanted the Elders in Brazil, then the Elders would be there.\\n\\n A security detail picked her up from the hotel and took her to the sprawling villa. Mimi thought it ironic that while her hosts\u0027 massive mansion commanded a grand view of the city, those wretched little huts she saw on the way, precariously perched on the cliff edges, probably had an even better view.\\n\\n She had expected a bigger to-do, and was surprised to find that only her fellow Conclave members were expected. The Brazilians usually threw massive parties, with samba dancers and festivities all through the night. But the evening was a quiet one, and Mimi politely chatted to a few of the wardens and Alfonso Almeida\u0027s intimidating wife, Dona Beatrice, before finding her seat at dinner.\\n\\n The first course was served, a warm and rich mushroom soup that consisted of a clear broth poured over a mound of mushroom pate. Mimi took a tentative sip. It was delicious. \"So Edmund, about our host committee for the spring gala,\" she said, turning to the dinner partner on her right. She had hoped to meet more tasty Brazilian men at the party, but since none were to be had, she settled for tackling some unresolved Committee business.\\n\\n \"Has the mayor\u0027s girlfriend turned you down already?\" Edmund inquired, dabbing the corners of his mouth with his napkin.\\n\\n Mimi grimaced. \"We haven\u0027t asked. You can\u0027t be serious. She\u0027s such a frump. Plus, she has no interest in ballet, you know.\"\\n\\n Edmund Oelrich chuckled as he sipped his wine, then suddenly began to choke. She assumed his meal had gone down the wrong way when blood began to spurt from his mouth. Mimi screamed. The Chief Warden had been stabbed in the back. On her left, Sophia Dupont was slumped over her soup, a silver dagger wedged into the small of her back.\\n\\n Then the lights went out, and all was darkness.\\n\\n This is a trap, Mimi thought, feeling an otherworldly calm as she dove under the table, faster than the knife that was meant for her heart now pinned to the back of her chair.\\n\\n Silver Bloods!\\n\\n Of course. But the Almeidas...they were from the royal line! How could they have turned?\\n\\n The fight was silent and swift. There was hardly a scream or a cry, only the hair-raising sound of her fellow Wardens gurgling blood. The Conclave was being slaughtered.\\n\\n Mimi attempted to collect her thoughts, to remember what she knew, to remember how to fight them. Good Lord, it had been centuries since she had confronted the beasts. Bliss had described seeing a shadowy creature with silver eyes and crimson pupils that night at the Repository. But Silver Bloods could assume any shape they chose, to camouflage their true form.\\n\\n Mimi bade herself to think, to remember. Her memories responded by flooding her mind with images that almost made her scream. Running through a dark forest, the tree branches scraping her skin, hearing the sound of her leather sandals slapping against the dirt path, feeling the high adrenaline rush of running for her life...but what was this, she was the one in pursuit. The beast was running away from her. She saw the mark of Lucifer on its skin, glowing in the dark.\\n\\n She returned to the present. Though the room was pitch black, with her vampire sight, she saw Dashiell Van Horn stabbed through the heart, witnessed Cushing Carondolet drained of all his blood, as a Silver Blood held the elderly Warden in its grasp. The room echoed with violent sucking sounds as the predator vampires alternately drank or disposed of their victims. When they were finished the Silver Bloods would take the shape of their victims. The vampire who had been Dorothea Rockefeller was no more. Replaced by a walking corpse with dead eyes.\\n\\n Too many of the Elders were slow and out of shape. Out of practice. They had forgotten how to fight.\\n\\n Mimi trembled as she grasped her sword, currently the size of a needle that she\u0027d stowed in her sequined evening bag. It was her only chance to get out of the house alive. But she was outnumbered. She would not be able to cut her way to freedom. Not now. There were too many of them for her to take alone. God, their numbers! Who knew they had so many? Where had they come from? She would have to hide. It was her only hope for survival.\\n\\n She inched her way out of the dining room to the hallway, picking her way through to an exit. So far she had escaped notice. Until she did not.\\n\\n \"Azrael.\" The voice was cold and deadly.\\n\\n Mimi turned to see Nan Cutler standing behind her, holding a sword to her chin. The Warden had lost her old-crone disguise - she looked as young as Mimi, and infinitely strong. Her white hair was a now a burnished gold, and the raven stripe a glossy river of black.\\n\\n \"You!\" Mimi accused. But the Cutlers were one of the original seven. One of the oldest and most respected families. Nan Cutler was Harbonah. The Angel of Annihilation. They had fought together side by side during the first inquisition, when Michael had commanded a heavenly army and had decimated their renegade vampire foes. \"But why?\" she asked, turning quickly and unsheathing her blade, knocking away Nan\u0027s sword.\\n\\n In answer, Nan slashed forward, slicing the air where Mimi had stood.\\n\\n Her eyes flashed. \"You do not have to perish,\" she said, lunging forward.\\n\\n Mimi grunted, parrying with a swift counterattack.\\n\\n \"You could join us. Join your brothers and sisters who are still fighting the good fight.\"\\n\\n The stupid witch actually thinks I would join their side? After everything Abbadon and I went through to secure this fragile peace we\u0027ve found on Earth? Mimi thought.\\n\\n \"You are one of us. You do not belong to the Light. It is not your true nature, Death-bringer.\"\\n\\n Mimi refused to reply and instead focused on locating Nan\u0027s vulnerability. They battled through the room, which was starting to fill with dark smoke.\\n\\n They\u0027re burning down the house, Mimi thought, panicking. Burning it with black fire, the only kind that could destroy the sangre azul...the immortal blue blood that ran in their veins. Destroy the blood, destroy the vampire...memories lost forever. True death for their kind.\\n\\n Nan cut Mimi\u0027s arm with her blade, her weapon finally drawing first blood.\\n\\n Bitch!\\n\\n That hurt!\\n\\n Mimi forgot to feel afraid, and sprung forward with no thought to her safety. She screamed a battle cry, one that came to mind only at that instant. One that Michael himself had used to rally his armies to battle.\\n\\n \"NEXI INFIDELES!\" she roared. Death to the Faithless! Death to the Traitors! She was Azrael. Golden and terrifying. Her hair and face and sword aflame with a blazing, incandescent light.\\n\\n And with a powerful sweep she cleaved the false Warden in two.\\n\\n Then she staggered backward. Black smoke was filling her lungs. She had to get out of there. She felt her way to the front door and yanked it open - just as a black-haired man was entering from the other side. In seconds he held a knife to her throat.\\n\\n Her heart dropped.\\n\\n The man holding her captive was Kingsley Martin.\\n\\n The Silver Blood traitor.\\n\\n This was her doom. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/revelations-blue-bloods-3/page-38.html","bookId":2121,"book":{"id":2121,"title":"Revelations (Blue Bloods #3)","description":"Storyline: Revelations (Blue Bloods #3) \\n Have you ever wondered what secrets lurk behind the closed doors of New York City’s wealthiest families?
