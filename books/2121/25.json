{"id":93379,"no":25,"title":"Page 25","content":"Bliss never understood Schuyler\u0027s infatuation with Jack Force and wished her friend would give up that particular ghost. Nothing good could ever come out of it. Even though Bliss was a new member of the Committee and was just starting to accept the ways of their kind, she\u0027d always understood one thing: you didn\u0027t mess around with the bond. The bond was serious stuff. Nothing would ever separate Jack and Mimi; nothing was ever supposed to come between them. It was impossible to even think otherwise. Bliss thought Schuyler had always taken it too lightly, which was odd for a girl whose very own mother was the first of their race to break her bond and live (if you could call that living) with the consequences. But as they say, love is blind.\n But she didn\u0027t say \"I told you so\" after the lecture. Bliss wasn\u0027t that kind of friend. Neither of them spoke as they left the Committee meeting. Oliver had excused himself quickly, leaving before the meeting had even been dismissed, while Schuyler was moody and silent on the walk home from school. Bliss didn\u0027t ask her if she still met Jack at that downtown apartment - a secret that Schuyler had spilled innocently one day, several months ago, when she\u0027d told Bliss about the key she\u0027d found in an envelope with an address slipped underneath her door. The next day, when Schuyler had come to school flushed and dreamy, Bliss had put two and two together.\n Bliss blamed Jack Force. He should know better. He had access to the wisdom of his past, whereas Schuyler was a new spirit, as blind and dumb as a Red Blood, really. He should have just left Schuyler alone.\n Both of Bliss\u0027s parents were home when she arrived, which surprised her. BobiAnne usually had her cellulite treatments at this time, and Forsyth was supposed to be in Washington for the week. She put her key in the sterling-silver dish on the front table and walked down the main hallway, drawn by the quarreling voices.\n It sounded like Forsyth and BobiAnne were screaming at each other. But Bliss soon realized it was just her vampire hearing that made it seem that way. In reality, they were whispering.\n \"Are you sure you had completely secured it?\" That was BobiAnne, sounding more agitated than Bliss had ever heard her before.\n \"Positive.\"\n \"I told you to take it away.\"\n \"And I told you that wouldn\u0027t be safe,\" Forsyth snapped.\n \"But who would take it? Who would even know we had it? He hasn\u0027t even realized it\u0027s missing. ...\"\n There was a hollow laugh. \"You\u0027re right. He\u0027s a wreck. He\u0027s finished. All he does is weep and pore over old photo albums, or listen to old tapes. Trinity is beside herself. It\u0027s pathetic. There\u0027s no way he knows.\"\n \"So who, then?\"\n \"You know my suspicions.\"\n \"But she\u0027s just a girl.\"\n \"She\u0027s more than that. You know that.\"\n \"But how can we be sure?\"\n \"We can\u0027t be.\"\n \"Unless...\"\n Their voices faded, and Bliss crept up the grand staircase to her room. She wondered what they were talking about. It sounded like they had lost something. Her mind flashed to the necklace she was wearing. She had never returned it to her father after the night of the Four Hundred Ball. But he had never asked for it back either. It couldn\u0027t be the necklace, because BobiAnne had seen her wearing it the other day and commented on how well it went with her eyes.\n She put away her things in her room and picked up her phone. Dylan had been on her mind all day after the visit. She couldn\u0027t believe he didn\u0027t even remember her. She didn\u0027t know whether to laugh or cry when she thought about him. Bliss changed out of her school clothes and put on something comfortable. She padded into the kitchen, where she found Jordan doing homework on the island counter.\n \"What\u0027s wrong?\" Jordan asked, looking up from her books. The kid was in all honors classes - something Bliss hadn\u0027t achieved until the vampire blood kicked in.\n \"Nothing.\" Bliss shook her head.\n \"It\u0027s about that boy, isn\u0027t it? Your friend?\" Jordan asked.\n Bliss sighed and nodded.\n She was relieved when her sister didn\u0027t press her to talk about it. Instead, Jordan broke her bar of Toblerone in half. It was Jordan\u0027s favorite candy, and she hoarded it in her room because BobiAnne was forever haranguing her about her weight.\n \"Thanks,\" Bliss said, taking a bite. The chocolate was sweet and delicious as it melted on her tongue. Bliss was touched. Her little sister had tried to make her feel better in the only way she knew how. \"You need help with anything?\" she asked, as a way to say she appreciated the thoughtful gesture.\n \"Nope.\" Jordan shook her head. \"You\u0027re hopeless at math anyway.\"\n \"You\u0027ve got that right.\" Bliss laughed. She zapped the remote toward the small plasma television hanging over the counter. \"Is this going to bother you?\" She asked, flipping through the channels.\n \"Nah.\"\n Bliss finished the chocolate and watched television while Jordan continued to work on her math problems. When Forsyth and BobiAnne entered the kitchen a few hours later to rally the family to dinner, they found the sisters still sitting quietly together, side by side. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/revelations-blue-bloods-3/page-25.html","bookId":2121,"book":{"id":2121,"title":"Revelations (Blue Bloods #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Revelations (Blue Bloods #3) \n Have you ever wondered what secrets lurk behind the closed doors of New York City’s wealthiest families?
