{"id":93356,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"Mimi Force liked the sound of stilettos on marble. Her patent-leather Jimmy Choos made a satisfying click, click, clack that echoed across the entire lobby of the Force Tower. The shiny new headquarters of her father\u0027s media empire comprised several buildings in the middle of midtown Manhattan. The gleaming elevator banks regularly disgorged a crew of \"Forcies\" - the beautiful employees of the Force media organization - design editors, fashion editors, lifestyle editors, heading off to lunch meetings at Michael\u0027s or into town cars that would escort them to various appointments around the city. They were a well-dressed group, with similarly pinched faces, as if their perpetually busy schedules didn\u0027t leave them time to smile. Mimi blended right in.\\n\\n She was only sixteen, but as she walked through the crowd, past the lobby and into the dark alcove that concealed an elevator that could only be accessed through a secret and irreproducible key, she felt incredibly old. She remembered when the Force Tower had originally been christened the Van Alen Building. For years it had stood as a mere three-story foundation, since its planned tower had never been built after the Crash of 1929 and the Great Depression. Only last year did her father\u0027s company finally complete construction according to the old plans and christened the building with a new name.\\n\\n Mimi looked around and discreetly sent a strong ignore-suggestion to anyone who might come near. She found the doorknob and pressed her finger against the lock, pricking it so that it drew blood. The blood analysis in the key lock was not the latest in security technology, but an antediluvian one. Her blood was being analyzed and compared to DNA files in the repository; a match would confirm that only a true Blue Blood stood at the gate. The blood could not be duplicated nor extracted. Vampire blood disappeared within minutes once exposed to the air.\\n\\n The doors whooshed open silently, and Mimi took the lift down. What Red Bloods did not know was that in 1929, the building had been built to completion - except it extended downward instead of up.\\n\\n The tower was actually a \"corescraper\" - a structure built underneath the ground, tunneling down to the planet\u0027s core, rather than up toward the sky. Mimi watched as the floors descended. She went fifty, then a hundred, then two hundred, then a thousand feet under the surface. In the past, the Blue Bloods had lived underground to hide from their Silver Blood attackers. Now Mimi understood what Charles Force had meant when he sneered that Lawrence and Cordelia would have the vampires \"cringing in caves once again.\"\\n\\n Finally the elevator stopped and the door opened. Mimi nodded to the Conduit at the desk. The Red Blood resembled a blind mole rat, looking as if he had not seen the sun in a long time. Rather like the false legends perpetuated about vampires, Mimi thought with amusement.\\n\\n She could feel the wards, the heavy protections placed around the area. This was supposed to be the Blue Bloods\u0027 most secret and secure haven. Lawrence took great pleasure in the shiny, conspicuous new tower that had been built on top of it. \"We\u0027re hiding in plain sight!\" he\u0027d chuckled. The Repository of History had recently been moved to several of the lower floors. Since the attack, the lair underneath the club had been abandoned. Mimi still felt guilty at what had happened there. But it wasn\u0027t her fault! She hadn\u0027t meant to bring any real harm. She\u0027d just wanted Schuyler out of the way. Perhaps she had been na��ve. No need to linger on that thought now.\\n\\n \"Evening, Madeleine,\" an elegantly dressed woman in a chic Chanel suit greeted her politely.\\n\\n \"Dorothea.\" Mimi nodded, following the old crone to the conference room. She knew that several members of the Conclave had not been keen on her admittance to the inner circle. They were worried she was still too young and not in command of her full memories, the entirety of the wisdom of all her past lives. The process toward a Blue Blood\u0027s complete self-actualization began during the transformation at fifteen, and continued until the end of one\u0027s Sunset Years (or approximately twenty-one years of age), when the human shell fully gave away, finally revealing the vampire underneath. Mimi didn\u0027t care what they thought. She was there to fulfill a duty, and if she didn\u0027t remember everything, she remembered enough.\\n\\n She was there because Lawrence had come to the Force mansion late one night, soon after they\u0027d returned from Venice, to speak to Charles. Mimi had overhead the entire conversation. When Lawrence had taken over as Regis, Charles had voluntarily resigned his seat on the Conclave, but Lawrence was urging him to reconsider.\\n\\n \"We need all our strength now. We need you, Charles. Don\u0027t turn your back on us.\" Lawrence\u0027s voice was low and gravelly. He coughed several times, and the smell of sweet tobacco from his pipe had filled the hallway outside her father\u0027s office.\\n\\n Charles was adamant. He had been humiliated and rejected. If the Conclave would not have him, he would not have the Conclave. \"Why do they need me when they have you, Regis,\" Charles spat, as if even saying it were distasteful.\\n\\n \"I will go.\"\\n\\n Lawrence had merely raised an eyebrow upon discovering Mimi standing in front of them. Charles hadn\u0027t looked too surprised either. Finding a way through locked doors had always been one of Mimi\u0027s talents, even as a young child.\\n\\n \"Azrael,\" Lawrence murmured. \"Do you remember?\"\\n\\n \"Not everything. Not yet. But I do remember you...Grandfather,\" Mimi said with a smirk.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s enough for me.\" Lawrence smiled in a way that was not too unlike Charles\u0027s own. \"Charles, it\u0027s decided. Mimi shall have your seat on the Conclave. She will report to you, as your representative. Azrael, you are dismissed.\"\\n\\n Mimi had been about to protest, until she realized she had been glommed into leaving the den without her noticing. The old coot was clever. But nothing was stopping her from pressing an ear against the doors.\\n\\n \"She is dangerous,\" Lawrence was saying softly. \"I was surprised to find that you had called up the twins to this cycle. Was it really necessary?\"\\n\\n \"Like you said, she is strong.\" Charles sighed. \"If there is battle ahead, as you want us all to believe, Lawrence, you will need her on your side.\"\\n\\n Lawrence snorted. \"If she stays true.\"\\n\\n \"She always has,\" Charles said sharply. \"And she was not the only one among us who once loved the Morningstar.\"\\n\\n \"A grave mistake we all made.\" Lawrence nodded.\\n\\n Charles said softly, \"No, not all of us.\"\\n\\n Mimi floated away from the door. She had heard all she needed to hear.\\n\\n Azrael. He\u0027d called her by her real name. A name that was etched deep into her consciousness, deep into her bones, her very blood. What was she except her name? When you were alive for thousands of years, taking a new moniker after another, names became like gift wrapping. Something decorative that you answered to. Take her name in this cycle, for example: Mimi. It was the name of a socialite, a flighty woman who spent her days maxing out credit cards and who cared only for spa treatments and dinner parties.\\n\\n It hid her true identity.\\n\\n For she was Azrael. Angel of Death. She brought darkness to the light. It was her gift and her curse.\\n\\n She was a Blue Blood. As Charles had said, one of the strongest. Charles and Lawrence had been talking about the end of days. The Fall. During the war with Lucifer, it had been Azrael and her twin, Abbadon, who had turned the tide, who had changed the course of the last battle. They had betrayed their prince and joined Michael, kneeling to the golden sword. They had stayed true to the light, even though they were made of the dark.\\n\\n Theirs had been a crucial desertion. If it were not for her and Jack, who could say who would have won? Would Lucifer be the king of all kings on a heavenly throne if they had not abandoned him? And what did they win anyway, but this endless life on earth. This endless cycle of reparation and absolution. For whom and for what did they make amends? Did God even know they existed anymore? Would they ever regain the paradise they had lost?\\n\\n Had it been worth it? Mimi wondered as she took her seat at the Conclave, only now noticing the grumblings among her peers.\\n\\n She looked to where Dorothea Rockefeller was staring. The shock almost sent her reeling. Inside the most protected, most secure haven of the Blue Bloods, and seated next to Lawrence in a place of honor, was none other than the disgraced former Venator, the Silver Blood traitor, Kingsley Martin.\\n\\n He caught her eye and pointed two fingers in the shape of a gun in her direction. And Kingsley being Kingsley, he smiled as he pretended to pull the trigger. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/revelations-blue-bloods-3/page-2.html","bookId":2121,"book":{"id":2121,"title":"Revelations (Blue Bloods #3)","description":"Storyline: Revelations (Blue Bloods #3) \\n Have you ever wondered what secrets lurk behind the closed doors of New York City’s wealthiest families?
