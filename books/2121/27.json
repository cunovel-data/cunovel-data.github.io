{"id":93381,"no":27,"title":"Page 27","content":"Because Mimi wanted to see Dylan right away, they decided to visit him the next day, which would mean cutting classes again. Not that Bliss minded all too much. Her grades were the furthest thing on her mind at that point. That evening, Bliss did not ask her father why he hadn\u0027t told the Conclave about Dylan. She was wary about letting him know she knew he was keeping secrets from her. Forsyth must have had his reasons, but somehow Bliss had a feeling he wouldn\u0027t share them.\n The next afternoon Bliss packed Dylan a care package. She knew he was receiving the best care money could buy, but Transitions wouldn\u0027t have the newest indie-rock CD or a copy of Absolute Sandman. She thought maybe if he had a couple of his favorite things, it would remind him who he was, and in tandem, what Bliss had meant to him. She just didn\u0027t want to give up on him. She\u0027d even decided to stop feeling rejected about what had happened when they\u0027d made out that fateful night. Maybe Dylan freaking out on her was just part of his sickness.\n Jordan walked by the doorway and peeked inside Bliss\u0027s room. \"Are you going up to Saratoga again?\" she asked.\n \"Yeah. Mimi wants to go see Dylan for the Conclave. And his doctor\u0027s there today. I can finally ask what\u0027s going on with him,\" Bliss explained, folding a new leather motorcycle jacket she\u0027d had her stylist track down at Barneys and stuffing it into the shopping bag.\n Her sister walked in and sat on the bed, watching Bliss pack. \"Hey ... I wanted to ask you...you know how you used to have your blackouts?\"\n \"Uh-huh.\" Bliss nodded, deciding against bringing the teddy bear in a \"Get Well\" T-shirt she\u0027d bought on impulse at a card shop. Dylan would definitely think it was corny. He\u0027d always made fun of her for having so many stuffed animals on her bed.\n \"Do you still get them?\"\n Bliss paused and thought about it. The blackouts used to come with unnerving regularity. She would pass out and wake up somewhere completely different from where she\u0027d begun, with no knowledge of how she\u0027d gotten there. \"No. And I haven\u0027t had a nightmare in months either.\"\n \"That\u0027s good,\" Jordan said, looking relieved.\n But Bliss wasn\u0027t finished talking. \"It\u0027s like, I get them during the day now. Like the other day - I saw this weird thing. I was holding my hairbrush and it turned into this, like, gold snake. Scared the crap out of me.\"\n Jordan paled. \"Gold snake?\"\n \"Yeah.\"\n \"And the other day I looked up at the sky, and I saw this seven-headed dragon. Freaked me out.\"\n \"This happens a lot?\" Jordan asked.\n Bliss shrugged. \"Kind of. I asked Dad about it. He said it was all ...\"\n \"Part of the transformation,\" Jordan chimed in.\n \"Yeah.\" Bliss finished packing. Her cell phone buzzed. Mimi was downstairs with the car, waiting. Jordan was still standing there, an odd expression on her face. She looked as if she were wrestling with a decision. \"What\u0027s up?\" Bliss asked.\n \"Nothing.\" Jordan shook her head. \"Have fun visiting your friend.\"\n Bliss hadn\u0027t hung out with Mimi for months, and at first she thought it would be uncomfortable between them, but she had forgotten how self-absorbed Mimi Force could be. Mimi chatted easily during the entire drive, talking about everything from her new cast of human familiars, which included the hottest boys from Collegiate and Horace Mann, along with a college kid or two, as well as her plans for the summer: an intensive Chinese-immersion program in Beijing, since she wanted to display language fluency for her Stanford application next year.\n \"Isn\u0027t that funny? Chinese is the only language that isn\u0027t in my memories. Huh. I\u0027m staying with Wah and Min, you know those Chinese twins we met at the Four Hundred Ball?\" Mimi giggled.\n When they arrived at Transitions, Dylan was alone in his room, watching television. \"Hey...Bliss...right?\" he asked, turning off the tube. \"And you are?\"\n \"Mimi.\" She looked at him sharply. \"You seriously don\u0027t remember us?\"\n \"I remember her,\" Dylan said a little shyly. \"She\u0027s come to see me a few times.\"\n \"I brought you a couple of things,\" Bliss said, holding up the fat bag of treats.\n \"Cool,\" Dylan said, digging into the bag. \"What\u0027s this for?\" he asked, holding up the black leather jacket.\n Bliss felt embarrassed. \"I ... um...you used to have one...\"\n \"No, it\u0027s...God, it\u0027s great.\" Dylan put it on. He looked just as handsome in it as the old one. He smiled at her, and her heart skipped a beat. He rooted in the bag again and removed an iPhone box.\n \"I thought you might want one,\" Bliss said. \"I hope you don\u0027t mind. I already programmed my number into it.\"\n \"Bliss,\" Mimi asked. \"Could you leave us alone for a bit? I\u0027d like to ask Dylan some questions.\"\n \"Sure.\"\n Bliss left the room. A few minutes later, Mimi opened the door. She looked at Bliss with a mixture of pity and contempt. \"Well?\" Bliss asked.\n \"It looks like he really has no memory,\" Mimi said.\n \"I told you.\"\n \"It\u0027s amazing. It\u0027s like he\u0027s a total blank slate.\"\n \"You say that like it\u0027s a good thing.\" Bliss glared at Mimi and went back inside the room.\n \"What did she want to know?\" she asked Dylan.\n Dylan shrugged. \"Not much...just a few weird things - and something about jeans or something. I didn\u0027t really get what she was after. I told her I didn\u0027t even know my name when I woke up.\"\n \"You really have no idea who I am?\" Bliss asked, sitting next to Dylan on the bed.\n He looked down at the comic book he was leafing through and put it away. Then he reached over and held her hand in his. She was surprised and looked at him fearfully...hopefully...\n Dylan frowned and then finally spoke. \"I don\u0027t know who you are. But I do know that every time I see you, I feel better.\"\n Bliss squeezed his hand and he squeezed hers back. They sat holding hands for a very long time. Until Mimi knocked on the door to let Bliss know Dylan\u0027s doctor was ready to see them.\n As they walked to the main building, Mimi took off her sunglasses and squinted at a figure walking toward Dylan\u0027s cottage. \"Hey, isn\u0027t that Oliver Hazard-Whatever?\"\n \"Yeah,\" Bliss said. Oliver had told her he might be visiting Dylan after school. Apparently he came up a lot to keep Dylan company. The two of them played chess. Dylan might have lost his memory, but he hadn\u0027t lost his ability to slaughter Oliver at the game, Oliver had told her.\n \"Hold on. I want to talk to him for a bit,\" Mimi said, heading in his direction.\n Bliss wondered what on earth Mimi would want to talk to Oliver about. The two of them despised each other. But they were too far away for her to overhear them.\n She did notice that when Mimi returned, she looked extremely pleased with herself, even more so than usual.\n As for Oliver, Bliss didn\u0027t have a chance to catch up with him. Whatever Mimi said to him shook him up so much, he never did visit Dylan that day. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/revelations-blue-bloods-3/page-27.html","bookId":2121,"book":{"id":2121,"title":"Revelations (Blue Bloods #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Revelations (Blue Bloods #3) \n Have you ever wondered what secrets lurk behind the closed doors of New York City’s wealthiest families?
