{"id":97484,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"He waded into the party. He did not see Dr. Evergreen or his wife. He felt awkward and wished he\u0027d waited for Penny so he would have had someone to talk to. He zigzagged his way to the wine table, grabbed a random jug of red, and filled a plastic cup. He tasted it. Good. He read the label on the giant jug. Three Thieves\u0027 Red. Horse-riding desperados adorned the label, pistols in the air. Allen had had Dr. Evergreen pegged as too pretentious for jug wine, but maybe he had the guy all wrong. Maybe this would all be okay after all.\\n\\n Allen accidentally bumped someone behind him. Purple wine spilled over his knuckles.\\n\\n \"Watch it, douche bag.\"\\n\\n Allen mumbled an apology, then saw it was Kurt Ramis, one of the testosterone-driven fiction writers from the MFA program. He wore a leather bomber jacket with a patch representing a fictional squadron. Shoulder-length, auburn hair carefully arranged to seem windblown, square jaw. Kurt thought he was the next Hemmingway; most of his fiction involved shooting large animals and getting laid.\\n\\n \"Hey, don\u0027t sweat it,\" Kurt said. \"How\u0027s the Jane Austen studies coming? They fit you for a dress yet?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re hilarious. And it\u0027s the Bront\u0026euml; sisters.\"\\n\\n The two girls on either side of Kurt giggled, but one of them said, \"Be nice.\"\\n\\n \"Whatever. Come on, ladies, and sit with me in the gazebo. I\u0027ll tell you about the novel I\u0027m working on. A rugged game hunter must guide a spoiled heiress through the Alaskan wilderness. It\u0027s got bestseller written all over it.\"\\n\\n Asshole.\\n\\n Allen decided to leave. To hell with it.\\n\\n He stopped, spotted Penny emerging from the sliding glass doors in the rear of Evergreen\u0027s house. She wore a black cocktail dress, the modest V of her neckline showing a hint of healthy pink skin. She was rosy-cheeked; hair done up and back. Allen was impressed. Penny actually looked like a girl. She was almost pretty.\\n\\n She saw him, and her smile widened bright and white. She skipped over to Allen.\\n\\n \"You look good,\" he said.\\n\\n \"You think?\" She did a little half spin. \"I\u0027ve had this dress for a while but not an excuse to wear it. Have you talked to Dr. Evergreen yet?\"\\n\\n \"I haven\u0027t seen him. I was just getting ready to leave.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, don\u0027t do that. I just got here.\"\\n\\n \"I can stay another few minutes, I guess.\"\\n\\n She smiled, and Allen did too. When she smiles like that, she is pretty, I guess.\\n\\n He shuffled awkwardly, suddenly found it not so easy to talk to her.\\n\\n \"I could use some wine,\" she said gently.\\n\\n \"Oh, yeah. Okay. Let me get it.\"\\n\\n He wriggled his way through the crowd back to the table, refilled his plastic cup with Three Thieves\u0027 Red, and filled a new one for Penny. He felt like he was at senior prom. Nervous. Snap out of it. It\u0027s just Penny. Good old pal Penny.\\n\\n He brought the wine back, handed her a cup. They stood, drank. He put his free hand in his pocket, shuffled his feet. The party ebbed and flowed around them.\\n\\n \"This is good wine,\" she said.\\n\\n \"Yes.\" He looked at her, looked away again.\\n\\n She moved in closer to him, surreptitiously pointed with her pinky at a young girl in denim across the party, and whispered in Allen\u0027s ear, \"She\u0027s in my poetry workshop and wrote a poem about a professor she has a crush on. You don\u0027t think it\u0027s Dr. Evergreen, do you?\"\\n\\n He snorted laughter, covered his mouth. They huddled together, whispering a game guessing the life stories of the other party guests based on how they looked. They laughed, and it was easy. This was good old Penny. Everything was right again.\\n\\n \"That girl in the thrift-store dress is creepy,\" Penny said. \"I heard her boyfriend dumped her and she just started cutting her leg with a kitchen knife. Just sat there, sawing bloody lines into her thigh.\"\\n\\n Speaking of creepy... \"Have you ever met Dr. Evergreen\u0027s wife?\" Allen asked.\\n\\n Penny shook her head. \"But I\u0027ve seen her with Dr. Evergreen at parties and readings. She looked beautiful, but sort of distant. You\u0027ve met her?\"\\n\\n \"Briefly.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s she like?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not really sure,\" Allen said. He found he could hardly remember her face. \"She\u0027s light on her feet, I know that.\"\\n\\n Penny grinned. \"What the heck does that mean?\"\\n\\n Allen started to explain when the hysterical woman found them.\\n\\n \"Oh, my God, Penny, you are not going to believe it.\" The new girl was petite, with sharp features, short black hair, a plaid skirt, and stylish white blouse. Pearls. Allen had seen her around the department and thought of her as Back East pretty. Red eyes. Tears had smeared her makeup. She swallowed great, heaving sobs between words.\\n\\n She latched onto Penny. People stared openly.\\n\\n \"Calm down, Blanche,\" Penny patted her friend on the shoulder. \"Let\u0027s go this way. Come on, honey.\"\\n\\n Penny led Blanche away from the gawkers, around the side of the house and under a low tree. Not knowing what else to do, Allen followed.\\n\\n \"Now, take a breath.\" Penny held her friend by the forearms, looked her square in the eyes.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s K-Kurt,\" Blanche said. \"I s-saw him kissing that skank Missy Logan in the woods next to Dr. Evergreen\u0027s house.\"\\n\\n Penny frowned, shook her head. \"I\u0027m so sorry, Blanche. I warned you about him.\"\\n\\n \"Missy f-fucking Logan,\" spat Blanche. \"She\u0027s a cow! Why would he-\" Her words were lost in a new torrent of wailing and hand-wringing.\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t see him with Missy earlier,\" Allen said. \"He was with two other women.\"\\n\\n Blanche wailed even louder, then threw herself onto Penny\u0027s shoulder, tears and snot flowing freely. Penny patted her friend\u0027s back and shot an accusing look at Allen.\\n\\n Allen shrugged. \"I\u0027m just saying-\"\\n\\n \"Well, don\u0027t,\" Penny said.\\n\\n Allen mouthed, \"Sorry.\" Then he took a step back.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve a good mind to find that boy and chew his ass right off,\" Penny said. \"Blanche, honey, stay here and pull yourself together. There\u0027s a lot of people at this party, and you don\u0027t want to give that rat-fuck Kurt the satisfaction.\"\\n\\n Blanche sobbed and nodded.\\n\\n \"Allen, stay with Blanche.\"\\n\\n \"Me? But-\"\\n\\n \"Stay!\"\\n\\n \"Yes, ma\u0027am.\"\\n\\n \"Hold this.\" Penny handed Allen her wine, stalked off, her fists clenched in righteous woman rage.\\n\\n Allen looked at Blanche and cleared his throat. \"That Kurt guy. He\u0027s an asshole, you know? You\u0027re better off without him.\"\\n\\n Blanche sniffed.\\n\\n \"Uh... can I get you a drink or something?\"\\n\\n Blanche nodded, sniffed again.\\n\\n \"Okay. Stay put. I\u0027ll be right back.\"\\n\\n Allen found the Thieves again, filled another plastic cup. Might as well top off his own drink and Penny\u0027s. He drained the jug.\\n\\n Two hands. Three cups. He gathered them into an awkward triangle, tried to walk, spilling purple over his hands. He slowed his walk, hunching over, balancing the wine. He looked at the wine as he walked, so deep and dark, like fresh blood. The blood of thieves.\\n\\n He wasn\u0027t watching where he was going and crashed into someone, knocking all three cups of wine down his front, staining his shirt and pants. He gasped at the splash of liquid, bit back a string of vulgarities.\\n\\n He stepped back, looked at the bearlike figure before him.\\n\\n \"Jesus Christ, kid. You smell like a Napa Valley wino.\"\\n\\n Allen gulped. \"Sorry, Dr. Evergreen. I hope I didn\u0027t get any on you.\"\\n\\n THREE\\n\\n Allen came out of the first-floor bathroom, holding up a pair of Dr. Evergreen\u0027s Portland Trailblazers sweatpants with one hand, his wine-stained clothes bunched in the other. He swam in an extra-extra-large Gothic State T-shirt, also Dr. Evergreen\u0027s. It was like wearing a circus tent.\\n\\n Dr. Forest Evergreen was lumberjack big, Paul Bunyan-ish, barrel-chested, chin the size of an engine block.\\n\\n Allen went from the bathroom to the kitchen. All modern stainless steel and computerized appliances. His eyeballs ping-ponged back and forth. Tentative. Where to go next? \"Dr. Evergreen?\"\\n\\n A voice from down the hall. \"This way.\"\\n\\n Allen went down the hall, past closed doors toward the end, where a half-open door spilled dim light into the hallway. He paused again.\\n\\n \"Get in here.\"\\n\\n Allen started, went inside.\\n\\n Dr. Evergreen\u0027s study was the complete opposite of his modern kitchen. It felt old, ancient in fact, like some old wizard\u0027s workroom from a bad Dungeons \u0026 Dragons movie. Very old, leather-bound books lined the shelves. Strange, arcane charts and graphs hung on the walls, and a large globe of the world during the Victorian Empire stood in one corner. Behind Ever-green\u0027s desk hung a yellowing chart, a detailed schematic of the human skeleton. The desk itself was big enough to match Evergreen-darkly polished wood with the nicks and scratches of centuries. Evergreen sat at the desk, a tumbler of amber liquid in one meaty fist. The half-glasses perched at the end of his nose looked small compared to his massive pumpkin head, like they\u0027d been ripped off a doll.\\n\\n Evergreen hunched over the desk, reading from a brochure without looking up. \"\u0027Imbued with old-world charm, this spacious apartment overlooks the fields and trees of Letna Park. Mere steps to the closest tram line, charming pubs, and a variety of restaurants.\u0027\" Evergreen looked over the glasses at Allen. \"What do you think?\"\\n\\n \"What is it?\"\\n\\n \"An apartment in Prague.\"\\n\\n \"Oh. Sounds good. I\u0027m sure I won\u0027t have a problem.\"\\n\\n \"Not for you, pinhead. For me. I\u0027ve arranged some dorm space for you.\"\\n\\n \"Okay.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not going to spill red wine all over the Czech Republic, are you?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m really sorry, Dr. Evergreen. I\u0027m not usually that clumsy, and-\"\\n\\n Evergreen motioned to the chair across from him. \"Sit.\"\\n\\n Allen sat.\\n\\n \"You know what I expect of you?\"\\n\\n \"I think,\" Allen said. \"I spoke to Professor Carpenter.\"\\n\\n \"Uh-huh. And what did ganja-head say?\"\\n\\n \"That I\u0027d be helping you with research. Something with Kafka.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, that\u0027s the story, but I\u0027ve got something a lot more important for you to work on. A real challenge for your research skills.\"\\n\\n \"Oh?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m getting a grant from the university for the trip, so it has to be some lit thing. I\u0027ve basically written it already. But frankly, I have more important things to work on. Are we clear?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t worry, I\u0027ll fill you in later,\" Evergreen said. \"Stop looking like that.\"\\n\\n \"Like what?\"\\n\\n \"Like somebody pissed down your back. Don\u0027t worry. It\u0027ll be fine.\"\\n\\n \"If you can give me some kind of idea what I\u0027ll be researching, maybe I can get started right away,\" Allen suggested. \"Get a head start.\"\\n\\n \"Save it for later. Think of it like a scavenger hunt. It\u0027ll be fun. You\u0027ll see.\"\\n\\n FOUR\\n\\n Allen went back out to the party and marched straight for the wine. He was in for a long semester. And a long summer. He gulped the wine, refilled the cup. Maybe he\u0027d make himself drunk. Why not?\\n\\n Penny planted herself in front of him. \"Where the hell have you been? I told you to stay with Blanche. Why are you dressed like that?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t have time to babysit your distraught friends. Look, I don\u0027t mean to be rude, but I\u0027m not having a very good time.\"\\n\\n \"Just tell her I\u0027m looking for her if you see her.\"\\n\\n \"Where are you going?\"\\n\\n \"Into those woods,\" Penny said. \"If I know Blanche, she\u0027ll go in there and try to catch Kurt making out with whatever skank is next on his to-do list.\"\\n\\n \"The woods? Don\u0027t go into the woods,\" Allen said.\\n\\n \"Why not?\"\\n\\n \"Because it\u0027s... the woods.\"\\n\\n \"If I see the big bad wolf, I\u0027ll point him toward Grandma\u0027s house.\"\\n\\n \"Just yell if you need any help.\"\\n\\n Penny rolled her eyes and left.\\n\\n Allen sipped wine. The party came and went around him. Dull.\\n\\n \"I hope you don\u0027t mind if I introduce myself.\"\\n\\n Allen looked up from his wine, raised an eyebrow.\\n\\n The man who had addressed him was a priest-black suit, white collar. Tall and athletic, late thirties or early forties. His hair was a deep black and just over his ears. Blue eyes. Crow\u0027s-feet. But a bright, energetic smile. He shook Allen\u0027s hand firmly.\\n\\n \"Father?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m Father Laramie,\" said the priest, \"but I hope you\u0027ll call me Paul.\"\\n\\n \"Father Paul.\"\\n\\n \"Just Paul.\"\\n\\n \"Okay.\"\\n\\n \"Penny tells me you\u0027re Catholic,\" said Father Paul. \"I didn\u0027t know if you were aware we held a Wednesday mass in the chapel on campus.\"\\n\\n \"Ah.\" Allen took a swig of wine to buy himself a second. He\u0027d mentioned to Penny that he\u0027d been brought up Catholic, but he hadn\u0027t attended mass in years. He had not even realized Gothic State had an on-campus chapel. How long since his last confession? Well, really, what did Allen have to confess?\\n\\n This thought depressed him somewhat.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m hoping I can convince you to come around and see us sometime,\" Father Paul said. \"I wouldn\u0027t be doing my job if I didn\u0027t encourage you a little.\"\\n\\n \"Uh.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-a-go-go/page-2.html","bookId":2600,"book":{"id":2600,"title":"Vampire a Go-Go","description":"Storyline: Victor Gischler is a master of the class-act literary spoof, and his work has drawn comparison to that of Douglas Adams, Kurt Vonnegut, and Thomas Pynchon. \\n Now, Gischler turns his attention to werewolves, alchemists, ghosts, witches, and gun-toting Jesuit priests in Vampire a Go-Go, a hilarious romp of spooky, Gothic entertainment.
