We have a surprisingly large congregation.\"\n \"Oh.\"\n \"I\u0027d like you to have something.\"\n Father Paul pushed something into Allen\u0027s hand. He looked down into his open palm and saw a velvet jewelry box. He opened it and saw a silver crucifix.\n \"That\u0027s a little welcome gift we present to all of our Catholic students,\" the priest told him. \"We want people to know we\u0027re here and that we care.\"\n Allen took the crucifix from the box. It wasn\u0027t small; it was heavy, maybe solid silver. Allen had a hard time believing they gave out one of these to every Catholic on campus. He started to hand it back to the priest. \"I think this might be too much. I don\u0027t feel right.\"\n \"No, no, please don\u0027t worry,\" Father Paul said. \"We pay for them out of the orphan fund.\"\n Allen blinked.\n \"That\u0027s a joke, Allen.\"\n Allen smiled weakly. \"Sorry.\"\n \"There\u0027s no obligation,\" Father Paul said. \"Why don\u0027t you wear it?\"\n \"Well, I don\u0027t generally-\"\n \"Wear it, Allen.\" The priest put a firm hand on Allen\u0027s shoulder, and an abrupt gravity descended upon the conversation. \"You\u0027d be surprised how such a simple gesture can bring... comfort.\"\n Father Paul\u0027s firm gaze held him a second, and Allen\u0027s mouth fell open, speechless. What the hell\u0027s going on here?\n Allen was about to firmly insist he didn\u0027t want the crucifix when a piercing scream split the night.\n \"Penny!\" Allen dropped his wine and ran for the line of trees. He plunged into the woods along the narrow hiking path. \"Penny!\"\n Thin branches slapped his face in the darkness. Allen winced but kept running. He turned a corner and smacked into somebody coming fast from the other direction. They both tumbled, went into the bushes. Allen stood, reached for the person with whom he\u0027d collided, and pulled her to her feet.\n Blanche threw herself on Allen. \"Oh, my God, oh, my God.\" Hysterical. Gulping for breath.\n Allen shook her by the shoulders. \"Where\u0027s Penny?\"\n \"My God, it\u0027s awful. He\u0027s dead. He\u0027s-he\u0027s been-it\u0027s-\" She shook her head frantically, the sobbing coming back double.\n He\u0027s dead, she\u0027d said. Not Penny. Allen shook her again by the shoulders, thought about slapping her like he\u0027d seen people do in the movies. \"Who\u0027s dead, Blanche?\"\n Blanche made a new, even shriller, panicked sound, pushed away from Allen, and ran back in the direction of the party.\n Allen followed the path in the other direction, but he didn\u0027t run now. His feet felt leaden. Fear sweat broke out on his forehead, and silver moonlight filtered through the thin canopy of leaves overhead. With Blanche\u0027s hysterical keening fading into the background, an eerie silence blanketed the woods. The bird chirps, the rustle of leaves, and the scurrying of squirrels had all been swallowed by the pall of dread that had suddenly sunk its claws into the landscape.\n Allen stopped walking, his breathing coming shallow. He looked back over his shoulder.\n No. Keep going. Penny is still out here someplace.\n He made himself jog forward, his footfalls crunching leaves so loudly that the sound seemed obscene. A smallish clearing opened before him, and he immediately saw the body lying on the ground, looking waxlike and unreal in the moonlight. Allen took three quick steps toward the body and froze.\n The head was missing.\n Allen approached more slowly, fighting down a wave of nausea. A bit of spine stuck out from the ragged neck hole, as if the head had been twisted off savagely and suddenly. Blood still oozed like raspberry syrup. A thick, wet coppery smell permeated the air. Allen didn\u0027t need the man\u0027s face to identify the body. The bomber jacket told the story.\n Kurt Ramis, Blanche\u0027s loudmouthed boyfriend.\n Allen briefly fantasized about Blanche flying into a rage at Kurt\u0027s infidelity, wrapping her arms around his neck, and wrenching Kurt\u0027s head free of his body.\n Unlikely.\n Who the hell could do such a thing?\n Allen heard a rustling in the bushes to his left. His head jerked around to see, and his body froze. He heard it before he saw it, a breathing and snorting, and then the low growl. Something in Allen\u0027s bowels went watery.\n It poked its head through the bushes. Eyes glowed like green fire; he saw a muzzle and pointed ears, red-brown fur standing out in spikes. A dog, an enormous dog of some kind, growling, drool dripping from gigantic fangs. No. Not a dog.\n A wolf.\n It was gigantic, dwarfed any wolf he\u0027d ever seen at the zoo. It snarled, lips peeled back to display two rows of yellow teeth. It crouched low, and Allen could almost feel its muscles tense, the powerful creature poised to spring.\n He remembered his grandfather saying never to run from a dog. They sense fear. Make eye contact. Back it down.\n Allen very much doubted his grandfather\u0027s advice applied in this situation.\n It\u0027s going to jump on me now. It\u0027s going to eat me. Holy shit, I\u0027ve got two seconds to live what the hell am I going to-\n Voices from back down the path, several coming toward him. A group, many talking in frantic voices.\n The wolf cocked its head toward the sound, listened a split second, then turned tail and vanished into the woods, departing with impressive speed.\n A mob formed behind Allen. A girl screamed. Allen recognized Father Paul\u0027s voice saying, \"Dear God!\"\n A heavy hand on his shoulder. Dr. Evergreen. \"Jesus, what the hell happened here?\"\n Allen\u0027s head was spinning, his gaze still fixed on the patch of bushes where he\u0027d seen the beast. \"I have absolutely no idea.\"\n FIVE\n Let us leave Gothic State University and its people and environs a moment, and let us travel across the country, across time zones, the Atlantic Ocean, to Europe, and a small cobblestone street in the Jewish Quarter of Prague in the Czech Republic.\n A side note: An alarming number of people still refer to it as Czechoslovakia. It\u0027s a republic now. I digress.\n The Jewish Quarter, or Josefov. Full of old-world charm and souvenir stands. Tourists simply went apeshit for old-world charm and souvenir stands, and nothing said \"old-world charm\" like a plastic replica of the Old-New Synagogue perched atop a plastic base with little Czech flags around the edges and a hole on one side for sharpening pencils. The Old-New Synagogue on Maiselova Street was the oldest in Europe still actively used as a house of prayer. The spiritual zeal of the Quarter was probably best expressed by a T-shirt that read, \"Prague Oy!\" and was available in all sizes at a nearby kiosk. In a narrow house next to a jewelry store, mere steps from this temple of worship, lived the disgraced rabbi, Abraham Zabel.\n Zabel was something of a wizard, and he sold his occult powers to the highest bidder.\n There was good money in this.\n Zabel is about to entertain an unhappy client.\n Let\u0027s watch.\n Abraham Zabel sat at the old scratched desk in the small office of his Josefov house. It was going on evening, and the steady din from the street of hucksters roping in tourists had relented somewhat. He thought often of giving up the house for someplace quieter in the suburbs, but the Jewish Quarter was too perfect, too close to places he needed to visit, people he needed to stay in contact with for his business. The tourists would remain a minor annoyance.\n He poured himself a glass of port and returned his attention to his journal, a combination diary and appointment book. On Thursday he had a demon banishing, but then he was free for the weekend. He relished the time off but was concerned that business had been slow. Well, no worry. It would eventually pick up again. It always did.\n The dark arts were ever in demand.\n He opened an intricately carved wooden desktop humidor and removed a thin cigar, lit it with a thin silver lighter. The humidor was carved with symbols from ancient Hebrew-various warding spells and protections. Zabel doubted the spells retained any potency, but the box looked nice, and it was convenient for the cigars.\n A knock at his office door startled him. It meant someone had let themselves into his locked home. Zabel thought briefly of the small revolver in his bottom desk drawer but decided to leave it. He was well protected in the little office. Zabel was a cautious man.\n He was about to tell his visitor to enter when the door swung open and a man entered. Zabel knew him: Pascal Worshamn, a client. He had bright blue eyes, alert and energetic, and a smooth pink face that made him look youngish, although the dusting of gray over his ears told his real age.\n \"Hello, Pascal.\" Zabel motioned to the small chair on the other side of his desk. \"A seat?\"\n Pascal didn\u0027t sit. \"We haven\u0027t concluded our business, Zabel.\"\n Zabel spoke good Czech and passable German, but he\u0027d been born in Brooklyn to Czech immigrants. Pascal was from some upper-crust place in London, so the conversation went on in English.\n \"I told you on the phone,\" Zabel said. \"You get what you pay for.\"\n \"It didn\u0027t work.\"\n Zabel sighed. \"It worked as well as it could. It killed the wrong man, I admit, but that must be because Evergreen caused some distraction. He\u0027s not without his own skills.\"\n \"Can\u0027t you control the thing? Tell it to try again.\"\n \"It can\u0027t,\" Zabel insisted. \"It was commanded to destroy itself after the kill. It wouldn\u0027t do to have a golem lumbering around attracting unwanted attention. It probably threw itself off a cliff into the ocean.\"\n \"Make another one,\" Pascal said.\n \"Pay me, and I will. You cheaped out the first time. You should have sent me along, to make the thing on the spot, so I could control the situation, allow for changes and surprises. My resources are not unlimited.\"\n \"Neither are the Society\u0027s.\" Pascal pulled a small automatic from his jacket pocket, aimed it at Zabel\u0027s chest. \"I must insist the Society get its money\u0027s worth. You\u0027ll make another golem.\"\n \"Only if you pay me.\"\n \"I don\u0027t think you appreciate the implications of this 9 mm pistol.\" Pascal stepped forward, trying to appear menacing.\n \"Threats, is it? Fine, let\u0027s trade threats. You\u0027re not going to leave here alive, Pascal. That\u0027s my promise to you.\"\n \"Are you deluded? Drunk? Too much port for you, my dear Zabel. I\u0027ll draw your attention to the obvious one last time. I\u0027m the one with the pistol.\"\n \"Shoot then.\"\n \"What?\"\n \"Go on,\" Zabel said. \"Shoot.\"\n Pascal lifted the pistol, stood pointing it for five seconds. Ten seconds. A light sweat broke out on his forehead. The hand holding the pistol developed a subtle tremor. Pascal laughed, embarrassed and nervous. \"I can\u0027t seem to pull the trigger.\"\n \"See the tapestry behind me? The paintings on either side of you?\"\n Pascal turned his head, looked at them. Abstract images with intricate patterns.\n \"The patterns are subtle, but woven into the mix are hypnotic suggestions reinforced by powerful spells,\" Zabel explained. \"Right now, your subconscious is being told that I am your best friend in the world and that you would never harm me. Every second you look at the pattern, the subliminal command grows stronger.\"\n Pascal jerked his gaze away from the painting, redoubled his efforts to shoot Zabel.\n \"It\u0027s no use, Pascal. Even a glance is enough.\"\n \"This isn\u0027t over, Zabel. The Society won\u0027t stand for it. They\u0027ll dog your every step.\"\n \"Lars!\" Zabel raised his voice. \"Lars, come here.\"\n The floor shook with heavy footsteps. The thing that appeared in the office doorway made Pascal wince and step back, a surprised gasp leaking out of him.\n The wooden man was six and a half feet tall, put together with mismatched pieces of wood. He smelled like pine. The face was an agonized grimace, wide, hollow eyes carved in dark wood, the mouth slightly open, the corner of a folded piece of parchment stuck out from between the thickly carved lips.\n \"Lars, please dispose of our friend Pascal.\"\n The golem advanced on Pascal, who screamed and backed against the wall. This time the pistol fired. Pascal squeezed the trigger until he emptied the magazine, the shots scarring the golem\u0027s chest, woodchips and splinters flying.\n The golem didn\u0027t flinch; it grabbed the wrist of Pascal\u0027s gun hand and twisted. Snap. Pascal screamed again, and the gun fell to the floor. One of the golem\u0027s powerful arms went around Pascal\u0027s neck. The man squirmed and tried to pull free, panic aflame in his eyes. \"Zabel, please. Zabel!\"\n The golem squeezed with one arm, put a gigantic hand on top of Pascal\u0027s head, and twisted. Pascal screamed in raw agony, and the golem twisted again and pulled. A wet snap and a crunch. Pascal\u0027s body went limp. The golem continued to wrench at the head, Pascal\u0027s limbs flopping around like a rag doll\u0027s.\n With a final, mighty tug, the golem pulled off Pascal\u0027s head with a wet pop. Blood sprayed.\n Zabel looked at his servant, who was cradling the head in the crook of his arm like a football. Perhaps he\u0027d been hasty. Information was never a bad idea. Zabel took a large serving tray from his small closet and set it on his desk. He instructed Lars to set the head there. \"Clean up the body in the usual manner, please, Lars.\"\n The golem threw the corpse over his shoulder and carried it away.\n Zabel sat at his desk, facing Pascal\u0027s head. He pulled a small velvet bag from his desk drawer, spilled the materials in front of him. He took a polished, dark red stone and placed it into Pascal\u0027s mouth. He lit a candle, mixed some powders and herbs in a small bowl, then mumbled a few syllables and blew the mixture into Pascal\u0027s face.\n The head\u0027s eyes fluttered and opened. \"Wha hammpned?\"\n \"Move the stone to the side of your mouth with your tongue,\" Zabel instructed. \"You\u0027ll be able to talk.\"\n \"What happened?\" Pascal asked. His eyes darted to either side. \"Good God! What\u0027s happened to me?\"\n \"Did you tell anyone else in the Society you\u0027d hired me to construct the golem?\"\n \"No,\" Pascal said. \"I was ordered to eliminate Evergreen. That\u0027s all. How I went about it was my own business. Damn, why did I tell you that?\"\n \"You\u0027re a Truth Head now,\" Zabel said. \"You can\u0027t lie. Who ordered you to eliminate Evergreen?\"\n \"Jackson Fay,\" said the head.\n Zabel sucked in breath. Jackson Fay. The name was not unknown to him. A very dangerous spellcaster. \"Why eliminate Evergreen?\"\n \"I was told he\u0027d persisted with unholy associations and would cause trouble if not handled. Fay did not elaborate. He simply trusted me to get the job done without going through the bureaucracy of a full Council vote.\"\n Zabel\u0027s lip curled into a mocking grin. \"It seems Fay\u0027s trust was misplaced.\"\n \"The Society will still be suspicious when I don\u0027t report in,\" Pascal said. \"They have ways. They will find you and avenge me.\"\n \"Perhaps, but not anytime soon.\"\n \"What the hell is this in my mouth?\"\n \"A bloodstone,\" Zabel said. \"If you spit it out, you\u0027ll break the spell.\"\n \"Then I will spit it out and damn your spell, you son of a bitch.\"\n \"Go ahead. Spit.\"\n Pascal shifted the stone from one side of his mouth to the other but didn\u0027t spit.\n Zabel laughed. \"You see? It\u0027s not so easy to give up life, is it? To resign yourself to oblivion. How we do cling to hope, we pitiful human creatures. Even now you\u0027re thinking there must be some way out of this, some way to reverse what has happened. Some do, in fact, spit out the bloodstone, but not you, Pascal. Oh no, not you.\"\n \"Damn you to hell, Zabel.\"\n \"Lars!\"\n The golem returned carrying a mop and a bucket.\n Zabel said, \"Before you clean up the blood, take Pascal\u0027s head to the cupboard with the others.\"\n The golem scooped up the head, then carried it out of the room under its arm.\n \"This isn\u0027t over!\" Pascal screamed back at Zabel. \"Do you hear me, you bastard? I might just be a head, but I\u0027ll get you. I\u0027ll get you, Zabel. I\u0027ll see you rot in hell!\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-a-go-go/page-3.html","bookId":2600,"book":{"id":2600,"title":"Vampire a Go-Go","description":"Storyline: \n Victor Gischler is a master of the class-act literary spoof, and his work has drawn comparison to that of Douglas Adams, Kurt Vonnegut, and Thomas Pynchon. \n Now, Gischler turns his attention to werewolves, alchemists, ghosts, witches, and gun-toting Jesuit priests in Vampire a Go-Go, a hilarious romp of spooky, Gothic entertainment.
