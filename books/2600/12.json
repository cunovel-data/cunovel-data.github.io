{"id":97494,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"He saw that Edgar was awaiting some kind of response. He took one more sip of brandy to stall and gather himself. \"What do you want from me?\" The words were beginning to slur, but he didn\u0027t care. He held out the cup for more brandy.\\n\\n Edgar filled it. \"Information. You\u0027re on the inside. We need to know what\u0027s happening. Something is coming from the north. I have foreseen this as well, but the picture is unclear. You must tell us when things change. We must know when to move.\"\\n\\n Kelley didn\u0027t want any part of this. He calculated a high probability of getting his ass thrown into the dungeon or getting his head chopped off or worse. He had a little money stashed away. He could buy a horse. Well, probably not a very good horse, but some nag to get him downriver and then maybe he\u0027d trade the nag for passage on one of the boats. If he could get to the Mediterranean, the world would be open to him.\\n\\n In the meantime, Edgar was watching him expectantly. Turning down the big man\u0027s request might have unfortunate consequences. Fanatics often seemed reasonable at first, but they could turn dangerous if thwarted. Best to play along.\\n\\n \"I suppose I can keep my ears and eyes open,\" Kelley said.\\n\\n \"Then you\u0027ll join our cause?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\" And I\u0027ll unjoin two seconds after I leave town.\\n\\n A smile split Edgar\u0027s wide face. \"Let\u0027s drink to it.\"\\n\\n He filled both cups, and they drank. Kelley could really feel it now. He might need a quick nap before walking back to the castle. No, he\u0027d stumbled home drunk before. He wasn\u0027t going to hang around with this man one second longer than necessary. He\u0027d bandy a few friendly words, make Edgar think he was enthusiastic about the cause, and then he\u0027d leave this shack and get back to the castle as fast as possible.\\n\\n Edgar smacked his lips and wiped his mouth with his sleeve. \"This is a great day to welcome you into the Society, Edward Kelley. Now let us brand you to seal the deal and show your loyalty.\"\\n\\n One of Kelley\u0027s eyebrows went up. \"What?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t have the materials for a proper tattoo, but a brand is perfectly acceptable. Some of the younger men actually see it as a right of manhood, so you\u0027ll be able to brag about it to the ladies.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want a brand.\"\\n\\n \"Well, as I\u0027ve told you, I don\u0027t have the ink for a tattoo. It\u0027ll have to be a brand. Don\u0027t worry-it only really hurts for a second.\"\\n\\n Kelley stood, knees watery, pushed away from the table. \"Uh... I think I\u0027m going to go now.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re a member of the Society, Kelley.\" Edgar latched onto Kelley\u0027s arm with a meaty hand. \"You\u0027ve got to show it.\"\\n\\n \"No!\"\\n\\n Kelley tried to twist away, but Edgar pulled him across the table and turned him over. He pulled down Kelley\u0027s pants.\\n\\n \"What are you doing?\" Kelley squirmed, but the big man held him easily.\\n\\n Edgar reached for an iron that had apparently been in the fire the whole time. He brought out the branding iron, the square and compass symbol with the pentagram in the center glowing white hot. Kelley glanced over his shoulder, eyes shooting wide.\\n\\n \"No, wait,\" Kelley said. \"Don\u0027t! Let\u0027s talk about-\"\\n\\n Edgar pressed the iron hard into Kelley\u0027s ass cheek. It sizzled and hissed. Kelley screamed. The smell of scorched hair and flesh. Edgar pulled the iron away, tossed it back into the fire.\\n\\n \"There,\" said the big man. \"You\u0027re one of us now officially.\"\\n\\n Kelley lay facedown on the table and groaned. \"You son of a bitch.\" His ass throbbed fire.\\n\\n \"Now don\u0027t be that way,\" Edgar said. \"We\u0027re brothers in the Society now.\"\\n\\n \"Sweet merciful God, that hurts. Why did you have to do that?\"\\n\\n \"We prepared the branding iron ahead of time,\" Edgar admitted. \"There is a spell binding you to the will of the Society. You cannot act against us now, and you will seek to keep our best interest at heart.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s some good crazy talk, but right now my ass is on fire. Hell and damnation.\" Kelley reached for the bottle of brandy, drained the last drop.\\n\\n \"I have a salve,\" Edgar said. \"It\u0027ll soothe you somewhat and prevent infection.\"\\n\\n A second later, Kelley felt Edgar smear something cool and greasy over his new brand. The hot sting subsided slightly. Kelley sighed. He slid off the table, pulled up his pants, not able to look Edgar in the eye.\\n\\n \"You should get back to the castle now,\" Edgar said. \"We\u0027ll be in contact.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah. Okay.\" Kelley didn\u0027t need to be told twice.\\n\\n He left the shack, limped along the narrow game trail back toward the castle, feeling vaguely ashamed.\\n\\n TWENTY-TWO\\n\\n Kelley went up to his room in the White Tower and flopped face-first onto the bed. The cool sheets soothed him. He let his eyes close. Yes, if sweet sleep would come to him, he could forget all about dark tunnels and secret societies and the deep burning throb in his backside. Sleep, Edward Kelley. Sleep and dream of plump white serving wenches.\\n\\n \"Oh, there you are, Edward,\" came Dee\u0027s voice from the doorway. \"Come help me with something. There\u0027s a good fellow.\"\\n\\n Kelley\u0027s eyes popped open. Bastard.\\n\\n He pushed himself up from the bed, groaned. He followed Dr. Dee downstairs and out of the tower, to where a wagon waited in the lane. It was hitched to a tired-looking gray horse with drooping ears. Dee stood next to a stack of chests and trunks and other packages.\\n\\n \"Get on the other end of this, will you, Edward?\" Dee bent, took one end of a long chest.\\n\\n Kelley helped him slide it into the back of the wagon. He helped load the trunks and other items until the tiny wagon was overflowing. The effort made Kelley break out in a cold, slick sweat. Any good feeling he\u0027d had from the brandy had faded. All he wanted to do was go back into the tower and flop into bed again.\\n\\n \"Thank you.\" Dee was panting too. \"I had a young lad from the stables helping me, but the little scamp has run off.\"\\n\\n \"Listen, I\u0027m not feeling all that well,\" Kelley said. \"So if we\u0027re finished loading all of your worldly possessions, I\u0027d like to get back to bed and-\" Kelley blinked at the wagon as if seeing it for the first time. \"Where are you going?\"\\n\\n \"Didn\u0027t I tell you? I\u0027m leaving. Back to England.\"\\n\\n \"You sure as hell did not tell me.\"\\n\\n Dee wrung his hands, had trouble looking Kelley in the face. \"Well, yes. I\u0027ve... been recalled by the Queen... uh... yes. Some sort of trouble at court that... uh... requires my expertise.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, pig shit, Dee!\" Kelley suddenly remembered Edgar saying he\u0027d foreseen Dee\u0027s departure. \"What\u0027s happened?\"\\n\\n Dee\u0027s eyes darted nervously up and down the quiet lane. \"Happened? Whatever are you talking about?\"\\n\\n \"Damn you, don\u0027t act stupid. Is it Rudolph? Has he done something insane?\"\\n\\n \"Fool,\" hissed Dee. He stepped right up next to Kelley and whispered, \"Do you want to put us on the chopping block? Keep your voice down.\"\\n\\n \"Talk to me, Dee.\"\\n\\n \"Okay,\" whispered Dee. \"Okay, fine. Listen. There are strange things happening. Trust me, you don\u0027t want to be involved. If I were you, I\u0027d pack and leave tonight.\"\\n\\n \"What strange things? Tell me.\"\\n\\n Dee sighed, looked suddenly so weary. \"Edward, I can\u0027t begin to explain. The complexities of-\"\\n\\n \"Does Rudolph want to live forever?\"\\n\\n Dee froze, then slowly lifted his chin and looked Kelley square in the eye. \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, you do.\"\\n\\n Dee cursed, took Kelley by the elbow, and leaned in to whisper even more quietly into Kelley\u0027s ear. \"The astrologers returned from their trip to the north. There were tales, villagers with wild stories about strange lights and the sky splitting open and the Heavens crumbling to earth. They found a village with a smoking crater in the center, every villager dead, their skin melted from their bodies.\"\\n\\n Dee crossed himself, and Kelley resisted the urge to do the same.\\n\\n \"They brought something back in a large, iron box,\" Dee said. \"They won\u0027t let anyone near it. I don\u0027t want to go near it. One of the astrologers told me that the three men who handled the object and loaded it into the iron box have taken violently ill. They are not expected to last through the night. All three are delusional and feverish.\"\\n\\n Dear God. This time Kelley did cross himself.\\n\\n Dee climbed onto the wagon and took the reins. \"I\u0027m getting the hell out of here. I\u0027d do the same if I were you, Edward. Farewell.\" Dee flicked the reins, and the nag clopped down the lane.\\n\\n Kelley raised a wan hand and waved, but Dee didn\u0027t look back. Kelley stood watching until the wagon turned a corner, the clip-clops fading away.\\n\\n He stood long seconds in the empty lane. It had become eerily quiet-no sounds of workmen from the courtyard, no chatter from castle servants. He looked up. Even the wind had died. The flags and banners atop the castle walls hung limp. It was as if the entire world held its breath, waiting to see what doom would fall on top of Kelley\u0027s head.\\n\\n To hell with this.\\n\\n Kelley darted for the tower, took the stairs two at a time until he reached his living quarters. He grabbed his cloth bag, tossed in his clothes, a few books. He had a small bag of coins and hoped it would be enough to get him as far as a seaport. He should have lived more frugally these last months. He\u0027d been too free with drink and women. No matter. If he could get to a port, he could work his passage if money ran short.\\n\\n Kelley took his clothes from the cloth bag, and put them in the footlocker. He put the books back on the shelf over the bed. He was about to stash the cloth bag when he froze. He had just packed all that. What was he doing?\\n\\n He stuffed the clothes back into the bag, took the books down from the shelf again. He was so rattled and nervous, that he didn\u0027t know what he was doing. He simply hadn\u0027t been paying attention. Really, the thought of all of one\u0027s skin melting off, well, that would distract anyone.\\n\\n He put the books back on the shelf, looked at them, blinked. What the hell? He grabbed the books again, put the books in his bag. Pay attention to what you\u0027re doing, idiot. He packed his clothes again. He threw the bag over his shoulder, threw the door open, and headed down the stairs.\\n\\n Kelley paused at Dee\u0027s room, then entered to see if the alchemist had left anything behind. Some of those potion ingredients could fetch pretty prices, especially certain herbs that might be out of season. He searched Dee\u0027s chambers but found nothing worth taking.\\n\\n He went back upstairs to his room and dumped his clothes out on the bed.\\n\\n He blinked at the clothes on the bed. What. The. Fuck.\\n\\n This was ridiculous. Why couldn\u0027t he get his possessions packed and get the hell out of this place? He was suddenly, acutely aware of the pulsing dull pain in his ass. What had Edgar told him? The brand had been prepared with spells, magic to make sure Kelley stayed loyal to the Society.\\n\\n No. It was all too far-fetched. He could walk away any time he wanted.\\n\\n Kelley left the luggage, jogged down the stairs, and ran out of the tower. He made himself slow to a fast walk through the castle courtyard, kept up the pace toward the gate. He passed through the gate and left the castle behind. Soon he\u0027d reach the Charles Bridge. Along the river he could catch a boat, or maybe he\u0027d simply keep walking south. There was no particular hurry as long as he kept going away from the castle, away from Prague.\\n\\n This would work. All Kelley needed to do was put one foot in front of the other. Don\u0027t look back. Just keep walking. So long, assholes, you won\u0027t have Edward Kelley to kick around anymore.\\n\\n He passed back underneath the castle gates, passed through the courtyard. He stopped before entering the White Tower. How had he come back here? He could not remember turning around, returning to the castle.\\n\\n He tried to leave again, walking fast, determined. He blinked, when he found himself back in his chambers in the White Tower.\\n\\n \"Son of a bitch!\"\\n\\n This time he ran, pumping his legs, his breath coming shallow. He ran and ran until a stitch burned in his side. He stopped, bent over, breathing heavily. He rubbed his side. His clothing was soaked with sweat. Kelley breathed deep, then stood straight.\\n\\n He stood at the foot of the White Tower.\\n\\n Kelley sank to his knees. \"Oh, no no no no.\"\\n\\n No matter what happened, he could not escape. It was as if his mind got distracted and his feet found their way back to Prague Castle and the White Tower.\\n\\n Kelley ran in every direction. He walked, jogged, skipped. No matter what, somehow he ended up back at the White Tower.\\n\\n The obvious fact that Kelley was now ruled by the Society\u0027s magic weighed on him with grim finality. He wasn\u0027t going anywhere. He was doomed to stay in Prague Castle and do the Society\u0027s bidding. He sighed, flopped into the chair at his small desk in his chamber. Edgar had made it clear that Kelley was to be the Society\u0027s eyes and ears inside. Perhaps that was the key. If Kelley fulfilled his obligation, maybe the spell would be broken. Maybe then he could leave.\\n\\n That meant he\u0027d have to find out what was in the iron box. Edward Kelley would have to confront the astrologers.\\n\\n TWENTY-THREE\\n\\n Kelley almost didn\u0027t make the final dozen steps. When he reached the top of the main tower of St. Vitus Cathedral, he collapsed on the stone landing, his chest heaving as he panted for breath. From the courtyard looking up, the tower had seemed only slightly taller than other towers he\u0027d seen, but the arduous climb up the steep, spiral staircase had sapped the strength from his legs and stolen his wind. A sickly sweat broke out on his forehead and down his back. Kelley would have to start taking better care of himself. He drank too much.\\n\\n \"Who are you?\"\\n\\n Kelley rolled over on his back, looked up at the man in the robe. \"I\u0027m... looking for... Roderick.\" He paused, gulped breath. \"I\u0027m... Edward Kelley.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m Roderick.\" The man was older than Kelley, even a few years older than Dee. He had a wild tangle of white hair that stuck out in every direction, a drawn face, and a nose like a beak; topped off by a white moustache and a beard with black streaks. \"What do you want? I\u0027m extremely busy.\" He had a thick German accent but spoke good English.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m an alchemist at court,\" Kelley said. \"I wanted to speak to you.\"\\n\\n \"One of Dee\u0027s cohorts,\" Roderick grunted. \"I thought you\u0027d gone.\"\\n\\n \"I understand you and your colleagues brought back something from the north. I\u0027m interested to hear about it.\"\\n\\n \"Sorry to disappoint you, but it\u0027s none of your business,\" Roderick said, turning away from Kelley. \"If you\u0027ll excuse me, I have work to do.\"\\n\\n Kelley sat up, looked around the top of the tower. The construction was incomplete. At the moment, a crude wooden platform had been built around the stone landing. Roderick had some sort of strange device on top of a tripod. A stool stood right next to it.\\n\\n \"What are you doing up here?\" Kelly asked.\\n\\n \"Waiting for sunset.\"\\n\\n \"What happens then?\"\\n\\n \"The angle of the sun will be right to test this.\" Roderick indicated a wooden box at his feet.\\n\\n Kelley went to the box and looked inside. Nestled in a bed of dry straw, a glass disc the size of a large serving plate glinted in the sun. Rainbow colors swirled in the glass, made Kelley\u0027s eyes cross. He reached for it. \"May I?\"\\n\\n \"You may not,\" snapped Roderick.\\n\\n Kelley jerked his hands back.\\n\\n \"The finest glassblowers labored a year under the watchful eye of my best assistant to fashion that lens,\" Roderick said. \"A single scratch ruins it. Even a greasy smudge from your finger will delay my experiment while the lens is painstakingly cleaned.\"\\n\\n Roderick\u0027s head spun to the horizon as the sun rapidly sank. \"Blast. It\u0027s almost time. Stand over there, Kelley. As long as you\u0027ve disturbed my work, you might as well assist me. Over there. Stay still.\"\\n\\n Kelley moved to the spot Roderick indicated, on the other side of the platform from the tripod. He stood still, watched the astrologer.\\n\\n Roderick donned a pair of white gloves. They looked as if they\u0027d been made of some soft material. Velvet? Very expensive and finely made. Roderick bent, took hold of the glass disc with utmost care, and lifted it slowly from its padded nest in the box. With exaggerated caution, Roderick took one deliberate step at a time. Kelley found he was holding his breath and let it out slowly.\\n\\n Roderick mounted the lens in a frame atop the tripod, hurried to clamp it into place, twisting knobs and securing latches. He swiveled the lens on the tripod, pointed it at Kelley.\\n\\n Kelley shuffled his feet. \"Uh, what are you doing?\"\\n\\n \"Keep still,\" ordered Roderick. \"The sun is nearly at its optimal angle. This probably won\u0027t hurt at all. Much.\"\\n\\n Kelley held up a finger. \"You know, maybe this isn\u0027t such a good idea after all. I\u0027m... uh... concerned that perhaps-\"\\n\\n The rays of the setting sun hit the lens. It flared a blinding blue, and Kelley flinched. It bathed him in soft cool light. Time seemed to slow. He saw the world creeping by, dust motes pausing in midflight. A bird over Roderick\u0027s shoulder wheeled with impossible slowness. His own heart beat a lazy lub-thub. He blinked his eyes, the eyelids falling as slowly as the setting sun itself, rising again like an old man in the morning.\\n\\n Kelley\u0027s head grew light, his vision washing out in a hazy blue.\\n\\n When his eyes popped open again, he was facedown on the platform, Roderick standing over him.\\n\\n \"So,\" Roderick began, \"how do you feel?\" Roderick held a quill poised over a piece of parchment.\\n\\n Kelley felt strange, but also... rested? He stood. Yes. His aches and pains had vanished, as if he\u0027d had a good night\u0027s sleep. As if he\u0027d never been hungover in his life. He relayed this information to Roderick, who scribbled it on the parchment.\\n\\n \"Good, good.\" Roderick nodded, scribbled further notes. \"This confirms what we suspected. Excellent.\"\\n\\n \"What did you do to me?\"\\n\\n \"Nothing you shouldn\u0027t be thankful for, my good man. While you alchemists are mixing your little potions and bowel remedies, the Astrologers\u0027 and Wizards\u0027 Guild is harnessing the power of the cosmos.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s a good trick. Please explain.\"\\n\\n \"What do you know of sunlight?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s warm and orange.\"\\n\\n \"Bah!\" Roderick made an impatient face. \"You call yourself a man of science. Very well, I\u0027ll try to keep this simple. When the sun comes up, you see its light shining down on the world. Seems simple, doesn\u0027t it? But you are, in fact, seeing millions of things happening at once. Countless elements all coming together in what seems to be the single phenomenon we call light. There are a number of waves, and they span a wide spectrum. But not just waves. Sunlight is actually composed-somewhat-of particles also, millions of them so small they are unobservable by the human eye. You\u0027re understanding all this?\"\\n\\n \"Of course,\" said Kelley, who understood not one bit of it.\\n\\n \"I have spent a lifetime discovering these secrets and designing the lenses. By filtering out some waves and particles and allowing others to pass through, we can control... well... the full implications have yet to be fathomed. The sun is both the destroyer and creator of all life on Mother Earth. It is the Alpha and the Omega of all existence. Rudolph\u0027s generous support has allowed my work to reach fruition.\"\\n\\n Kelley cleared his throat. \"Yes, well, Rudolph has us working on an important project as well. The alchemists are divining the secret process of transmuting lead into gold.\"\\n\\n Roderick paused, looked at Edward Kelley blankly, then burst into uncontrolled laughter. He stopped abruptly upon seeing Kelley\u0027s expression. \"Oh, hell, you\u0027re serious, aren\u0027t you? Well... that\u0027s, you know, that\u0027s... uh... that\u0027s a good project too. Yeah.\"\\n\\n Kelley sighed. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-a-go-go/page-12.html","bookId":2600,"book":{"id":2600,"title":"Vampire a Go-Go","description":"Storyline: Victor Gischler is a master of the class-act literary spoof, and his work has drawn comparison to that of Douglas Adams, Kurt Vonnegut, and Thomas Pynchon. \\n Now, Gischler turns his attention to werewolves, alchemists, ghosts, witches, and gun-toting Jesuit priests in Vampire a Go-Go, a hilarious romp of spooky, Gothic entertainment.
