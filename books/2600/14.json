{"id":97496,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"Amy nibbled her bottom lip, concern crossing her face. \"They\u0027re going to be wondering about us.\" She looked at Allen. \"About you. I\u0027ve got to let them know we\u0027re okay and get instructions for what to do next.\"\n \"There\u0027s a pay phone near the tram stop,\" Penny offered.\n \"Wait a minute,\" Allen said. \"I\u0027m not interested in your calling your Society pals just so they can stuff me in a trunk again.\"\n \"We should get in touch with Father Paul,\" Penny insisted. \"I\u0027m telling you there\u0027s some kind of mistake. You\u0027re wrong about him.\"\n \"No!\" Sudden heat in Amy\u0027s voice. \"I need to get in touch with the Society. There are things happening, and we need to know. Come with me to the pay phone.\"\n \"To hell with that,\" Allen said.\n \"Then I\u0027ll go make the call myself,\" Amy said.\n \"If you do, I\u0027ll run out of here as fast as I can. As soon as you\u0027re out of sight, I\u0027m gone,\" Allen warned. \"Unless you promise not to tell them where we are.\"\n She opened her mouth to object.\n Allen cut her off. \"Just tell them we\u0027re fine. Find out what\u0027s going on if you want to, but just give us some time to rest. Please.\"\n Amy went a little pink in the face, clearly frustrated.\n Too bad, Allen thought. I\u0027m tired of getting shoved around.\n \"Okay,\" Amy said. \"But you\u0027ve got to promise to wait here until I get back. I could spell you, compel you to stay, but I don\u0027t want to do that.\"\n Allen rolled his eyes. \"Yes, fine. I promise. Please don\u0027t spell me.\"\n \"Okay. I\u0027ll be back.\"\n She left. They listened to her footfalls fade down the outside stairs. The silence stretched a full minute.\n \"She\u0027s very attractive, Allen,\" Penny said. \"I suppose I can understand why you\u0027d be interested.\"\n \"Oh, just... we\u0027re not... I barely even know her and... what do you care, anyway?\"\n \"Me?\" Penny\u0027s hand went to her chest, her eyebrows arching in innocent surprise. \"Oh, I don\u0027t care. None of my business. How you conduct yourself is of no concern to me.\" She made a low, disapproving noise in her throat, almost like a growl.\n Allen sighed, then sank into the chair. \"Don\u0027t be that way.\"\n \"What way?\"\n \"That way.\"\n \"Okay, okay,\" Penny said. \"It\u0027s just that we\u0027re close friends, and well, I don\u0027t know. I guess I feel a little proprietary about you or something, and it was just kind of sudden seeing you guys together in bed and, anyway, I don\u0027t even know what I\u0027m saying so I\u0027ll just shut up.\"\n Penny had always been there for him; she\u0027d talked him back to sanity when he\u0027d gone through the gut-wrenching breakup with Brenda. She\u0027d been solid as a rock, a steadfast friend and classmate. Why was she so suddenly bent out of shape about a minor misunderstanding?\n It was almost as if she was... jealous? She\u0027d said she felt a little proprietary about him, but she\u0027d meant like a sister. Right?\n He rubbed his eyes with the heels of his hands. He couldn\u0027t think about this right now.\n \"My head is swimming,\" Allen said. \"If I don\u0027t sleep soon, I\u0027ll drop dead.\"\n Penny said, \"Take my bed. The sheets are fresh. I should have offered sooner. Frankly, you look terrible.\"\n He smiled weakly. \"Thanks.\"\n \"I\u0027ll hit the market. You\u0027ll want something to eat sooner or later.\"\n Allen pushed himself out of the chair and headed for Penny\u0027s bed.\n \"Allen?\"\n He paused in the doorway to her bedroom and looked back at her. \"Yes?\"\n She smiled, warm, all earlier irritation gone from her face. \"Never mind. I\u0027ll be back soon.\"\n Allen crawled into Penny\u0027s bed and was asleep in less than ten seconds.\n Father Paul and Finnegan stood in Allen\u0027s dorm room.\n Finnegan poked through the random clothing spread out on the top bunk. \"The boy\u0027s not much of a housekeeper, is he?\"\n \"They left in a hurry.\" Father Paul\u0027s sharp eyes took in the small room quickly. \"Just like in those chambers below Zizkov.\" He nudged a damp towel on the floor with his boot. \"They showered and changed.\"\n The big priest raised an eyebrow. \"They?\"\n Father Paul pointed at the floor. \"Two towels.\" Then he pointed at the pink wad in the corner. \"Women\u0027s clothes. I saw her wearing them when we stormed the Society safe house. I think we fouled up, Finnegan. When we went in guns blazing to save Cabbot, it made us look like the bad guys, didn\u0027t it?\"\n \"We\u0027ll set him straight, sir.\"\n \"We\u0027ve been doing this all wrong,\" Father Paul said. \"Instead of chasing after him, we need to get ahead, wait for him someplace down the line.\"\n \"Where?\"\n Father Paul stuck a cigarette into his mouth without lighting it. \"What\u0027s the word on Evergreen\u0027s apartment?\"\n \"About a block from here. We\u0027ve got somebody watching,\" Finnegan said. \"But intelligence still thinks it\u0027s a decoy. The professor has probably rented a place under a different name, maybe out in one of the suburbs.\"\n Father Paul lit the cigarette, puffed. \"Let\u0027s find out where.\"\n Allen opened his eyes and looked at his watch. He\u0027d slept three hours. He swung his feet over the side of the bed, felt fuzzy-headed. He shuffled into the tiny bathroom, splashed water in his face. The dim light over the sink buzzed. The face that looked back at him in the mirror had dark circles under the eyes.\n Back in the sitting room, he spotted Amy on the couch, shoes off, breathing lightly. He tiptoed past her into the kitchen. Penny had left a note on the small table:\n Allen,\n There\u0027s food in the refrigerator. I\u0027m going to let you and your Friend sleep. I can tell you\u0027ve both had a tough time. I\u0027ll be back soon. Please wait for me.\n Penny\n Allen built himself a salami sandwich on dark bread with some soft kind of orange cheese. A bottle of water. He sat at the small kitchen table, chewing and considering his situation.\n Had Amy kept her promise to keep her Society friends at bay? He finished the sandwich, put the plate in the sink. And where had Penny gone? The sudden notion she\u0027d gone to fetch Father Paul sent a shiver of anxiety up Allen\u0027s spine. Penny refused to believe the priest could possibly be one of the bad guys. She might be bringing him back here at this very minute in some misguided attempt to help Allen. Amy claimed to be one of the good guys too. Everyone said they wanted to help him.\n So why did Allen feel like a rabbit with hounds on his heels?\n He leaned against the doorframe between the kitchen and the sitting room, looked again at Amy curled on the couch. It could be a lot worse. He could be stuck with Clover. If he\u0027d been on the run with the punk rock girl, he\u0027d probably have been hog-tied with tape over his mouth, stashed in some closet.\n Allen had to admit his time with Amy had not been entirely unpleasant. Perhaps that was why he\u0027d felt slightly defensive with Penny earlier. He\u0027d not been doing anything wrong with Amy when Penny had walked in on them-not that Allen would have refused any offers.\n And yet... Penny. He was starting to see her in a way that hadn\u0027t occurred to him before. Or had it? Hadn\u0027t he always wondered about her? Just a little.\n Okay, this was ridiculous. The completely gorgeous girl on the couch in front of him had been part of a plot to kidnap him. His close friend Penny was a devout Catholic who was likely on her way to a priest who seemed to favor automatic weapons over rosary beads.\n Allen turned away from the sleeping girl and walked softly across the kitchen. He\u0027d promised to wait until she returned. Well, she\u0027d returned. Yeah, he was splitting hairs, but the fact was Allen had to figure things out, and Penny and Amy would only continue to cloud his thinking. He opened the door, stepped outside, and closed it quietly.\n Allen needed answers. He walked quietly down the steps and headed toward the tram stop. The man who seemed to be at the core of this shit-storm would have those answers, Allen hoped.\n Allen hopped the next tram headed toward Letna and Professor Evergreen\u0027s apartment.\n TWENTY-SEVEN\n Jackson Fay sat at the oversized wooden desk. It was too big for his small faculty office at St. Sebastian\u0027s College, but he liked the artificial sense of power it gave him, although he did not admit this to himself, not exactly in that way.\n Power. It filled him yet left him hungry for more. The most powerful aphrodisiac he\u0027d ever known, yet the climax never came. It was the curse of power that the more he had, the more he needed.\n He looked out his dingy window. London was as drab and gray as his mood.\n A knock, the one he\u0027d been waiting for, sounded at his door. \"Enter.\"\n The door swung open and an old woman entered. She had steel-colored hair and deep lines at her eyes. She wore a black pantsuit, starched white blouse, and a bloodred brooch at the throat. An apple-cheeked man in a slightly garish pin-striped suit followed her, closing the door behind him. They stood crowded up against the desk.\n \"Professor Fay,\" the old woman said, nodding at him. Her companion nodded too.\n \"Margaret. Blake.\" He returned the nod.\n \"There is bad news out of Prague,\" the old woman reported. \"Our people were hit hard, scattered. News trickles in, but we don\u0027t have the complete picture.\"\n \"The Vatican?\"\n Margaret nodded. \"A crack squad of Battle Jesuits, if I\u0027m reading the situation correctly. The cardinals are giving us top priority, it seems.\"\n Fay steepled his fingers under his chin, sat back in the oversized leather chair. He considered the bad news. Jackson Fay was a lean man, with straight shoulders and eyes so green it seemed as if someone had airbrushed them. He had thick black hair with streaks of white above each ear, and a sharp chin and cheekbones. He wore a tan tweed jacket and a muted red vest.\n \"We have perhaps overreached,\" Fay admitted. \"What does the Council say about withdrawing our operation?\"\n \"There\u0027s more,\" Margaret said. \"Evergreen is apparently very close to the philosopher\u0027s stone.\"\n \"A little too damn close for comfort, if you ask me.\" Blake\u0027s voice had a mild Irish lilt.\n Fay leaned forward and rested his elbows on the enormous desk. \"That\u0027s not acceptable.\"\n Margaret shook her head. \"No.\"\n \"The stone in Evergreen\u0027s hands would be... problematic.\"\n Margaret nodded. \"Yes.\"\n \"Suggestions?\"\n Blake cleared his throat nervously. \"We think our position toward Evergreen should... ah... be taken to the next level.\" He tugged at his tie, as if he was suddenly uncomfortable.\n \"We want him killed,\" Margaret clarified. \"Before he gets the stone and uses it.\"\n \"That has already been attempted,\" Fay told them.\n Margaret raised an eyebrow. Although the Society bylaws allowed the high councilman to take emergency actions without consulting the rest of the Council, the elimination of a rogue member would usually be seen as significant enough to call a meeting.\n \"And are we convinced he even knows how to use it?\" Fay asked.\n \"The Council would prefer not to take that chance.\" Margaret shrugged, a slight movement.\n \"What if,\" posed Fay, \"we let our Mr. Evergreen find the stone?\"\n Blake made a vague choking sound and tugged at his tie again.\n Margaret asked, \"To what end?\"\n \"Finding it is the hard part,\" Fay said. \"It would not be so difficult to then take it away from him.\"\n The old woman considered, then said, \"Naturally, if the stone were to come into our possession for safekeeping, that would be best. Perhaps our people could even divine a way to destroy the blasted thing.\"\n \"I suppose,\" Fay said. \"But that\u0027s not precisely what I meant. What if we could find a way to use the stone ourselves?\"\n Blake went pale. Margaret frowned.\n \"This could be one of the most powerful arcane items in recorded history,\" Fay said. \"Can we not harness its power, use it for our own purposes?\"\n Margaret and Blake looked at each other. Tension grew thick in the room.\n \"I would oppose such a scheme,\" Margaret said. \"As I believe would the rest of the Council.\"\n Blake nodded apologetically. \"Yes, I\u0027d quite have to agree, old chap. Just too damn risky, don\u0027t you see?\"\n Margaret\u0027s eyes were hard as granite. \"I think our high councilman understands our feelings in this matter.\" Her gaze remained unwavering, locked on Fay.\n Another long tense moment.\n Fay sighed, relaxed back into his chair. \"Naturally you\u0027re right, Margaret. You too, Blake.\"\n The old woman\u0027s gaze softened microscopically. Blake actually laughed, wiped sweat from his forehead.\n \"As high councilman, it\u0027s my responsibility to consider all possibilities. I hope you can appreciate that. Still.\" He leaned forward, lowering his voice and encouraging the others to lean in to hear him. \"There is one minor aspect of this situation you may have failed to consider fully.\" He reached for a small, wooden box at the corner of his desk and lifted the lid.\n Margaret raised an eyebrow. \"And what might that be?\"\n Fay reached into the box with thumb and forefinger, pinched out a small portion of the dull silver powder within. \"This.\"\n Fay blew the powder into her face, harsh syllables flying from his mouth immediately after.\n The dust particles hardened to tiny diamond shards, blasting the old woman\u0027s face, shredding flesh and bone. Blood sprayed against the door and wall behind her. A scream began somewhere deep in her throat, but it was cut short as glittering death flayed her tongue, turned the back of her throat into hamburger. She dropped dead onto Fay\u0027s expensive Persian rug.\n \"Bastard.\" Blake looked appalled, confused, betrayed. Terrified. His hand glowed blue-green as he raised it toward Fay.\n Fay was already out of his chair and across the desk. He grabbed Blake\u0027s wrist and twisted, the karma bolt discharging harmlessly into the ceiling.\n With his other hand, Fay thrust a thin dagger into Blake\u0027s gut.\n Blake grunted, eyes going wide. He looked down where Fay still held the blade in his belly. A silver skull at the end of the hilt grinned up at him. Blake\u0027s mouth tried to form words. Fay twisted the dagger, and Blake coughed blood.\n \"Anticlimactic, isn\u0027t it?\" Fay said, acid in his voice. \"All of the intricate and deadly magic at my disposal, yet you meet your end with a simple dagger thrust.\"\n Fay jerked the blade out and thrust it home again. \"Never underestimate the mundane.\" Blake twitched. Fay gave another stab to be sure, and Blake\u0027s eyes rolled up like cartoon window shades.\n Fay let the man go, and Blake fell facedown across the desk, a pool of blood spreading to a stack of ungraded essays on King Arthur and the Holy Grail.\n He looked from Blake\u0027s dead body to Margaret\u0027s ruined face. The sweet sensation of power still hummed along his bones. He\u0027d been itching to try out the spell he\u0027d used on the old woman. It had felt exactly as good as he\u0027d anticipated. No heroine junky could know this feeling, no coke-head. And it was getting more difficult to reach this euphoria each time. Jackson Fay needed the philosopher\u0027s stone. He\u0027d outgrown the Society, had long suspected his personal ambitions would have forced him to make some sort of decision like this sooner or later.\n And he\u0027d never liked Margaret anyway, possibly because he\u0027d been able to tell she\u0027d never really liked him. A shame about Blake, though. A nice enough fellow, eager to please, but ultimately useless and a bit weak.\n Fay took a pocket handkerchief from his jacket, wiped the blood from his hands and dagger. Fay appraised the mess he\u0027d just made. There was no time to deal with it now. A simpler aversion spell would keep people out of his office until he had time to tidy up. He really should try to discover a simple spell that made dead bodies disappear.\n He picked up the phone and dialed the extension for his department\u0027s administrative assistant. \"Edna, can you book me a flight to Prague? Right away, please.\"\n TWENTY-EIGHT\n Two hours later, Jackson Fay sat aboard a Virgin Airways flight to Prague, sipping a glass of Pinot Noir and contemplating the savage things he would do to Professor Evergreen to make him divulge the secrets of the philosopher\u0027s stone.\n But a mere twenty minutes after Fay left the still warm bodies of his fellow Council members lying on his office floor, the red gem of Margaret\u0027s brooch began to glow at her throat, dully at first, then more brilliantly. A stranger walking his basset hound below Fay\u0027s office window paused to consider the sudden red glow, then shrugged and went about his business.\n This is when Margaret joined me among the legions of the untimely dead. I wish I could have been there to show her the ropes. Still, she seemed to have a natural talent for it. In her own limited way, Margaret made a reasonably effective ghost. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-a-go-go/page-14.html","bookId":2600,"book":{"id":2600,"title":"Vampire a Go-Go","description":"Storyline: \n Victor Gischler is a master of the class-act literary spoof, and his work has drawn comparison to that of Douglas Adams, Kurt Vonnegut, and Thomas Pynchon. \n Now, Gischler turns his attention to werewolves, alchemists, ghosts, witches, and gun-toting Jesuit priests in Vampire a Go-Go, a hilarious romp of spooky, Gothic entertainment.
