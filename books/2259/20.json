One hand to use the whip and the other to hold onto that strap-on you must wearwhile you’re wielding it.” Gavin and Marissaboth recoiled as if he’d struck her. “You little asshole,” she said through clenched teeth, straightening up and stepping toward Tucker. “I’ll break both your legs, you arrogant little man. Then we’ll see if your manners improve.” “Well, you look as though you spend a lot of time flat on your back. It doesn’t seem to have helped your manners any.” Her dark eyes flashed in anger and a sound like a growl came out of her throat as she moved toward him so quickly he barely registered the movement. She had a hand wrapped tightly around his throat and pulled him up on his toes before he could move so much as a step away. Gavin brought his hand down on her arm quickly, knocking her away from Tucker and pushing her backward to step in front of him. “Marissa! What the hell are you thinking? Please leave now before I have to do something both of us will regret. I’m sure Tucker apologizes for the things he said.” She looked up at Gavin with smoldering eyes and then turned on her heel and walked rapidly from the room, disappearing through the front door. Gavin whirled around to put his hands on Tucker’s shoulders. “Are you all right? Did she hurt you?” Tucker shrugged him off. “What do you care?Don’t apologize for me!” he said, pulling down his shirt. “I’m not the least bit sorry for anything I said. The bitch started it herself. Oh, I am sorry to have interrupted your little reunion there, Gavin. You seemed to be enjoying it so much.” He turned around and strode back to the table where his father was still sitting, looking alarmed. Tucker sat down, wondering if, like a cartoon character, steam was rising from his ears. His chest was heaving a little, and he was hyper-aware of Gavin following him to take a seat at their table. “Gavin,” Richard said worriedly, “What was that all about with Marissa?” “Nothingmuch,” Gavin said tightly. “Tucker’s just been making friends again.” “Not nearly so friendly as you, though, right?” Tucker glared across the table at him, watching with satisfaction as his cheeks turned red. “Marissa and I used to date a little. She was welcoming me home, that’s all.” “Yeah, right. If she’d had her tongue any further down your throat she’d have given you a tonsillectomy.” “Tucker!” Richard said reprovingly. “Please, Tucker, show respect to your alpha.” “Sorry, but I’m not a member of his pack, Dad, so he’s not my alpha. Apparently, he’s not my anything.” Tucker stood up, his hands shaking. He could feel the stares of the others around him, but damn it, he felt like having a full-blown meltdown. He’d come up here with Gavin, abandoning his job and his friends, trusting him, believing him when he said he wanted him for his mate. Not that he’d made any decisions about it, but that was totally beside the point. Then to find him on his first morning there making out with a woman right in front of him! He was so furious, he was shaking. Realizing he was probably channeling Shannen Doherty in her worst diva moment, but beyond caring, he flung his napkin down on the table and would have swept from the room except for a firm hand on his arm, yanking him back down into his seat. In total surprise, he looked over at his father, who had plastered a smile on his face while still gripping his arm. “Even if you hate me for this, I have to do it, Tucker, to protect you. You aren’t leaving this table. Now here comes your breakfast. You’re going to eat and pretend to be civilized. As for you, Gavin, drink some damn coffee and smile. I respect you, but I won’t have my son’s reputation ruined over a silly lover’s quarrel. Now, both of you straighten up.” Tucker saw Gavin’s mouth fall open, mirroring his own as they both gaped at Richard. Emily bustled up at that moment with his breakfast and another plateful of scrambled eggs and bacon for Gavin. “Good morning, Alpha. So good to see you back. I brought you the usual. I hope that’s all right.” Gavin gazed up at her and nodded, almost in a daze. She turned her smile on Tucker then and set his plate down in front of him. “I hope I’m not spilling any beans here, but Todd told me the two of you are bloodmates. I’m so happy for you both.” Gavin cleared his throat. “Uh, thank you, Emily. Very sweet of you.” Tucker opened his mouth to say something, but his father squeezed his arm and gave him another stern look. Tucker pulled his arm away, but kept quiet, addressing himself to his plate. At first he took only a couple of nibbles, as Emily continued to stand by Gavin, chatting with him blithely, ignoring the fact that she was the only one really talking. The food was so good, though, that soon Tucker had polished off the entire meal, and found himself actually feeling a little calmer. Bryson had always teased him that he was a bitch when he was hungry. Maybe he was right. Emily finally went off to fill coffee cups, and Richard touched his hand. “I’m sorry, Tucker. I know I probably overstepped my bounds, since you barely know me, but I know how this group is, and I’m trying to take care of you. Everyone in the pack is very nice and will welcome you, don’t get me wrong. But they’re also really protective of their alpha, and you’re a newcomer. One of the gammas—I suspect Christian,” he said, with a significant look at Gavin, “has already been spreading rumors of your arguments on the way back up here. News of your little disagreement with Marissa will spread fast too. The two of you need to stop messing around and complete your mating.” Gavin spoke up grimly before Tucker could manage to get a word out. “Tucker’s not ready.” He glanced over at Tucker and took another sip of his coffee. “Well, we hardly know each other,” Tucker said in the little silence that followed. “I met Gavin only a couple of weeks ago, for God’s sake.” His father nodded. “I realize that, but you have a bloodmatch. I knew your mother for a week before we married. I would have married her the first day, if I could have figured out how to ask her.” He turned back to Tucker. “I’d love for you to spend the day with me today, Tucker, if that’s all right with you, Gavin? Maybe a little distance from each other will help you put things in perspective. I could show Tucker around and explain things a bit. I know all this must seem so strange, and Gavin has a lot of work to do since he’s been out of town for a while.” Tucker shrugged. “Okay, sure.” “And Gavin, I’ve planned a small reception tonight after dinner for Tucker. Just to introduce him to everyone. I hope that’s all right.” “Of course,” Gavin turned to Tucker. “Is that all right with you, Tucker?” “Well…” Richard touched his hand again. “We’re very social here, Tucker, and like to get together often. I’d love to show you off to everyone, but I’ll cancel it if you’d like.” “No, it’s okay, I guess.” Richard beamed at him. “Thank you, son. We’ll keep it very casual—nothing too extreme, I promise.” Richard stood up. “If you’re ready then, Tucker?” Both Tucker and Gavin stood up too. Tucker shoved his hands in his pockets, still angry at Gavin, but feeling like he wanted to make up in some way before leaving him for the day. He didn’t want Gavin to think he had forgiven him so quickly, though. He hesitated for a moment, trying to decide what to say. The decision was made for him when Gavin pulled him into his arms. His lips took possession of Tucker’s until he couldn’t think anymore. He pulled his head away finally and gazed down into his eyes. “Until tonight then, baby,” he whispered next to his ear. “I love you.” He released him and turned away to go back upstairs. Tucker watched him as he climbed the stairs, enjoying the view of his ass in the tight jeans he was wearing. “Damn,” he said softly, and Richard smiled. “Those were my exact words the first time I saw your mother walk away from me. I hated to see her go, but I loved to watch her leave.” Chapter Seven “You look very handsome.” Tucker glanced over at his father and smiled before looking down at himself. He had changed his Tshirt for a baby blue merino wool sweater borrowed from his father’s wardrobe. The air was much cooler up here on the mountain than the temperatures he’d been used to, so even though it was June, the sweater felt pretty good. It was a little too big, of course, but by pushing up the sleeves, he thought he looked nice and not too dressed up. They were sitting in the dining area of the common room, as it was called, waiting for Gavin to show up. A few guests had already arrived, and were sampling some of the cake and punch the servers had set up earlier. He thought his father had already introduced him to just about everyone in the lodge by this time, but a steady stream of newcomers were proving him wrong. He and his father had been busy all day, first taking a tour of the lodge, stopping every few minutes to talk to someone his father knew, and then later, Richard drove him around the local area so he could see just how beautiful the mountains were. He’d been impressed by views of the hills stretching out for as far as he could see, the green hues fading softly to blue in the distance. There were waterfalls seemingly everywhere too, splashing down the mountains. Some were majestic and grand, while others, like the one they called Bridal Veil Falls, was little more than a fine, wide spray tumbling onto the rocks below. That one was over in North Carolina, though only a thirty or forty minute drive from the lodge. His father had taken him on a pretty extensive tour, and they had stopped at a little town high on one of the mountains for lunch. The day had been relaxed and easier than Tucker ever imagined. Maybe because of his father’s laid-back personality, or because he looked so young, Tucker felt more like he was spending the day with a new friend instead of his dad. The talk between them only turned serious once, during lunch at a little outdoor café.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bad-moon-on-the-rise-dark-hollow-wolf-pack-7/page-20.html","bookId":2259,"book":{"id":2259,"title":"Bad Moon on the Rise (Dark Hollow Wolf Pack #7)","description":"Storyline: Bad Moon on the Rise (Dark Hollow Wolf Pack #7) Living on the Gulf coast of Florida, Detective Tucker is investigating a series of strange, violent murders.
