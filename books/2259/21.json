You need to go through with the match as soon as possible.”\\n\\n Tucker almost choked on his sandwich. “Well, nothing like getting right to the point.” He leaned back in his chair and regarded his father solemnly. “I think it’s too soon.”\\n\\n Richard shook his head. “Not for a bloodmatch. I know you’re not familiar with our ways yet, son, but the match is damn near perfect. No one knows exactly what it is, but there’s no doubt that it’s powerful and there’s no avoiding it. When it hits you, you just know, without a shadow of a doubt that you’ve found your mate, the one perfect person for you in the whole world. It’s so compelling that it takes away all the normal barriers, like sex or age or philosophical differences—all the things that might stand in the way. He’s your match, Tucker, in every way. And he’s the alpha—you’ll be the alpha’s pet, and that’s quite an honor.”\\n\\n Tucker made a scoffing sound. “To be called a pet? No thanks. I’m nobody’s sex toy.”\\n\\n “No, you’ve got it all wrong. It was a little like that in the past, but not anymore.”\\n\\n “Yeah? Then why does everyone act like pets are second class citizens or something? Marissa sneered at me, you know, and made a lot of disparaging comments.”\\n\\n Richard shook his head. “Marissa is jealous. She’d hoped to be the alpha’s mate someday. Gavin even jokingly told her once that if he hadn’t met his bloodmatch by the time he was thirty, he’d marry her.”\\n\\n “Jokingly, huh?”\\n\\n “Of course, only Marissa didn’t take it that way. One day she’ll find her match and forget all about Gavin. That’s how it works, Tucker.”\\n\\n “I’m still not convinced. How come Emily is a waitress? Because she’s just a pet?”\\n\\n “No, not at all. She must have asked for the job. No one would have forced her. Look, Tucker, I admit that many of the wolves are domineering, but things are changing fast now for all the pets, including the human ones we adopt into the pack. Natural pets, like you, were always given more freedom, and often had jobs in the nearby communities. Our so-called adopted mates, however, were kept closer to the lodges. We wrongly believed that if they weren’t closely controlled they would turn feral—sort of like what you’ve probably seen in the werewolf movies. For hundreds of years, we believed that, and kept them rigidly controlled out of love and concern for them. We gave them our blood to drink to keep them safe from the horror of that, but because they were our mates, and we were overly protective, most of us got a little too overbearing.”\\n\\n Tucker looked uncomfortable. “Um, they drank blood? I wouldn’t be expected to…”\\n\\n “No,” Richard said quickly. “That’s only for humans. Don’t worry. Gavin will take very good care of you, even though he might be a little over protective at first, like I said.”\\n\\n “Yeah,” Tucker said, laughing bitterly. “I’ve seen that in action.”\\n\\n Richard smiled. “Alphas are always the worst, most domineering of all the wolves. It comes with the territory, I guess. But Gavin is a good alpha, the best we’ve ever had. He’s a good man too, and has integrity and strength. He’ll make you a wonderful husband.”\\n\\n “God, this is so weird on so many levels. I never thought I’d hear my parent say something like that to me.”\\n\\n Richard looked confused. “Really? Why not? I only want the best for you.”\\n\\n “I know, and I appreciate it, really. But this is something I have to decide on my own. I hope you understand.”\\n\\n “Okay, but don’t take too long. If Marissa can convince Gavin that his bloodmatch wants nothing to do with him, then that will clear the way for her.”\\n\\n “I haven’t been exactly standoffish, you know, and God, I can’t believe I’m having this conversation with you. Please, drop it. I’m begging you.”\\n\\n Richard smiled. “Okay, but don’t underestimate her. The bloodmatch is strong, but hell hath no fury, and all that. Marissa could be a force to be reckoned with.”\\n\\n “Yeah? Well, so can I.”\\n\\n “Yes, I think she’s already discovered that earlier today. She might be spoiling for a rematch, so if you see her tonight, don’t rise to the bait. She’ll be trying to make you look bad.”\\n\\n “Oh, I can usually do that all by myself.”\\n\\n Someone clearing their throat beside him made him turn around and focus on Emily, who was standing by the table. “Hi, Tucker, Richard. You know my mate, Todd, of course, don’t you, Tucker?”\\n\\n Tucker smiled and nodded at Emily and her husband, Todd, who had come up beside him. “Sure. How’s it going?”\\n\\n Toddnodded respectfully to Richard before giving Tucker a look that wasn’t exactly unpleasant, but not more than a shade or two off. “Tucker,” he replied coldly. “How are you?” He turned his back on them then, perhaps a little too quickly and went off to speak to some of his friends. Tucker saw Richard’s lips tighten. Emily gave them a sweet little smile and trailed after him.\\n\\n Tucker turned to Richard and shrugged. “I probably deserved that. I haven’t been exactly a lot of laughs since they found me in Panama City. I almost got them arrested at one point.”\\n\\n “I don’t care what you did, you most certainly do not deserve that, and I’ll have a talk with Todd myself later on. Todd and Christian are two of Gavin’s personal guards, and very loyal to him. But you’re my son, no matter what else happened between you and Gavin, and they’ll show you the same respect they show me, or I’ll know the reason why.”\\n\\n “What’s the matter?” said a deep, smooth voice at his ear and he turned to see Gavin standing next to them, looking all kinds of sexy in a navy polo and the usual tight jeans. Tucker was a little surprised at how glad he was to see him, and melted into his side happily when Gavin sat down and slipped his arm around Tucker’s waist.\\n\\n “Nothing,” Tucker said. “Dad, here, is getting all bent out of shape over what he thought was an insult to me. It was nothing, really.”\\n\\n “Insult? Who?” Gavin asked sharply, looking over at Richard.\\n\\n “Your boy Todd,” he replied. “He and Christian have been running their mouths since you got back, and the story of your fight in the back seat has made the rounds enough that it’s grown to you knocking Tucker out and tying him up to make him come with you. That is just a story, right?”\\n\\n Gavin looked surprised. “Of course.” He pulled Tucker protectively closer to his side. “I would never hit Tucker!”\\n\\n “He never hit me. Just held me down for a few minutes, because I was trying to knee him after he took my phone.” Tucker smiled. “You did threaten to tie me, though.”\\n\\n Gavin’s cheeks colored, but he shook his head. “It was only a bluff. I offered to take you home if you wanted to go after that.”\\n\\n “I know. We worked it out, and things were fine after that. I wonder why they’re spreading that rumor.”\\n\\n “I think I can guess,” Richard said, gazing across the room. Tucker followed his gaze to where Christian and Marissa were standing with their heads close together. “Marissa and Christian are good friends, aren’t they? Both in your personal guard?”\\n\\n “Yes, but…you think Marissa is behind this?”\\n\\n Tucker smiled again. “I’d have to say, hell yes.” He reached up and patted Gavin’s cheek. Gavin gazed down at him with his beautiful warm eyes full of love and concern. Suddenly, Tucker wondered what he was waiting on. Shit, I’m in love with him. I have been for a while.\\n\\n He really had burned his bridges when he left Florida with Gavin. He still had an apartment there, but no family left and almost certainly no job waiting for him. On the other hand, he had two people right here at the table who professed to love him and wanted to give him a home and a family.\\n\\n Decision made, he turned to face Richard and sighed loudly. “Okay, Dad, I give in. Time to make your big announcement.”\\n\\n Richard looked at him with his eyes shining. “Are you sure, Tucker? I don’t want to feel like I’ve talked you into this.”\\n\\n Tucker laughed and rolled his eyes. “Really? No, don’t worry about it. I probably decided a few days ago when I left Florida, but I’ve been stubborn, I guess. Go ahead.”\\n\\n Gavin frowned down at both of them. “Am I missing something here? What are you talking about? What big announcement?”\\n\\n “My son’s engagement to our alpha,” Richard replied smoothly. “Unless you’ve changed your mind.”\\n\\n Gavin’s eyebrows rose almost comically, and he pulled Tucker around to look into his eyes. “Are you sure, sweetheart? Really?”\\n\\n “Yes, I’m sure. And it looks like it’s time to stake my claim.”\\n\\n Gavin kissed him fiercely and then stood up, raising his voice to be heard above the crowd. “Everybody quiet down a minute, please. My beta has something he’d like to say.”\\n\\n Richard stepped forward with a look of pride on his face. “Thank you all for coming tonight to help me welcome my son back in my life after so many years apart. I think you can all imagine how much this means to me.” He paused for a moment as a round of soft applause swept over the crowded room. “It’s also my pleasure to announce something of importance to the entire pack—my son’s engagement to the alpha.”\\n\\n A little gasp went around the room this time, as Gavin stepped forward, pulling Tucker with him. “In our pack, we value strength, and in the fight with the Hunters, we’ve needed it. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that the alphas of all three of the Dark Hollow Packs have been given strong individuals as their bloodmates. These pets have proven time and again how intelligent they are and how strong their will is. Tucker is strong too, like the other alphas’ mates and independent. With them by our sides, I think we can face any challenges the future holds. Tonight I’ll claim Tucker as my own. And I invite you all to our mating ceremony to follow at the next full moon. Because of the recent attacks on the pets, I think we should have the ceremony in the ancient ancestral ring, inviting all the Werekin clans, to show our enemies the strength of our numbers and our people.” \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bad-moon-on-the-rise-dark-hollow-wolf-pack-7/page-21.html","bookId":2259,"book":{"id":2259,"title":"Bad Moon on the Rise (Dark Hollow Wolf Pack #7)","description":"Storyline: Bad Moon on the Rise (Dark Hollow Wolf Pack #7) \\n Living on the Gulf coast of Florida, Detective Tucker is investigating a series of strange, violent murders.
