He kissed Tucker in front of the entire assembly and then bent to sweep him up in his arms. Tucker stopped him by taking a step backward. “You might have noticed I’m not a girl. I can walk up the damn steps.” Gavin grinned and held out his hand, and they walked to the top together. As they reached the second floor landing, Gavin turned around to salute the crowd and Tucker glanced downward. At the foot of the staircase stood Marissa, and it seemed to him that the hatred in her black eyes was almost palpable. “You’ve seen my knot, baby, and I have to warn you it’s going to hurt like hell going in, but I’ll try to prepare and stretch you. We’ll use a lot of lube, and I swear I’ll take things slowly, okay? Once it’s in, you’ll have a lot of orgasms, and um…a few people even pass out. Just hang on and try to ride it out till it’s over.” Gavin stood naked by the side of the bed with Tucker gazing up at him. Tucker was so beautiful, lying on his back in the dimly lit room, his hand trailing absently on his chest causing Gavin to concentrate hard on just what he needed to tell him. Gavin himself was obviously fully aroused, his cock red and engorged, bouncing around as he moved. Even the knot seemed a little larger as he stared down at it, trying to decide if it would ever fit inside Tucker. Now that the moment had arrived, he was nervous, not wanting to hurt his lover or scare him in any way. The knot was really not much larger than some anal plugs he’d seen at its biggest width, and probably softer, so he knew it would work, but this was all new to him too. Tucker, lying on his back in the middle of the bed had an unconvinced look on his face as he stared at the knot. “Why do we have to put that inside me? Or even better question, why can’t I just do you?” “Well, hell, it doesn’t w ork that way, Tucker. The knot is what causes the bond to form between us. It secretes some hormones, and…” “What kind of hormones?” “I-I’m not sure. Why?” “Well, I’d like to know what the hell I’m getting myself into. Am I going to change into a wolf too? Will I get a knot on my dick?” “No, Tucker. It doesn’t work that way. I already told you. Okay, let’s go over this again. I’ll bite you on the back of the neck…” “Is that absolutely necessary? I mean, no offense, but doctors say the human mouth has more germs than just about anything. I don’t want to catch some disease.” “I’m not human, Tucker. Besides, you’ve had your mouth on a lot worse.” “Oh, right. Well, same principle though, probably.” “The bite is required.” “Oh.” “Okay, so then I’ll make love to you, like I said, and give you the knot. Afterward, you’ll have to drink my blood,” Gavin paused a moment to see if Tucker was going to interrupt again. This had been a real sticking point the last few times they’d gone over this point, Tucker insistingthat Richard had told him he wouldn’t have to drink the blood. Gavin had patiently explained that he’d only have to do it this one time, right after they first mated, and he had grudgingly accepted the fact. Gavin paused now to see if he would have any further objections, but Tucker simply gazed up at him trustingly. Damn, he was so delicious. He wanted to eat him right up. Shaking his head, he tried to regain his focus and give Tucker time to voice his objections. When nothing else was said, he continued. “Then you’ll have the orgasms and you’ll kind of go in heat.” “What?” “Go in heat. Sort of. You’ll be really anxious to have sex, like really anxious. I will be too, luckily, sowe’ll kind of go at it all night. Maybe even all day tomorrow, but that’s usually just with human pets. You’re half wolf, so it shouldn’t be as intense a change, or that’s what I’ve heard.” “Multiple orgasms, huh? I thought that was only for women. And when you say, I’ll be in heat…I won’t drip anything gross out of my, um…” “God no!” “Okay, good,’cause eww…” “Tucker, please concentrate on what I’m telling you.” “I am concentrating, but I have questions.” Gavin took a deep breath. “Okay. What else do you want to know?” “Well, I can’t think of anything else right this second.” “Okay, then turn over, sweetheart. I’ll get you ready.” Tucker got up on his knees, turning around toput a hand on the back of Gavin’s neck, pulling him in for a kiss. Gavin met his lips hungrily. Tucker’s lips were warm and sweet. Gavin saw that Tucker’s cock was filling out before he pushed him gently down on his stomach and began to smooth the lube over his crease. Climbing onto the bed behind him, he lubed Tucker up well, and put his fingers in to stretch him a bit. “Relax for me, baby,” he whispered, dropping kisses on his back. “We’re just going to take our time, okay?” His fingers probed deeper inside, curving down to find his prostate. When he found it, he gave it a rubdown with his fingers that had Tucker squirming and groaning. “God, that feels good…” Tucker arched back into Gavin trying to get just the right angle, and laughing, Gavin slapped him lightly on his ass. Gavin reached around to give Tucker’s cock some attention, and with the stimulation from both sides, Tucker was soon making mindless whimpering sounds, alternating between pushing back on his fingers and pushing forward into his hand. Gavin bent over his back, kissing the side of his neck, becoming more and more aroused. He pulled Tucker up to his knees, and held one hand on his chest while the other moved more and more rapidly up and down his engorged cock. When Tucker came into his hand, Gavin’s fangs descended and he sank them into Tucker’s neck. Tucker writhed under him, his breath coming in big hitches as his body tried to process the chemicals that were flooding into him. Pulling out his fangs, Gavin bent him back over, and thrust deeply inside him, right up to the knot. Tucker was trying to push back on him, groaning loudly, so he took that opportunity to push in deep and hard and managed to get some of the knot inside him. Tucker cried out and tried to pull away, but Gavin put his hand on his stomach and pushed him back with one hand, while working in the knot with the other. He fumbled for the lube and managed to get some more on the crucial area, all the while soothing his mate with soft kisses and licks on the bite mark. “Push back against me, baby. Bear down…” Tucker was already going into heat from the bite and was too far gone to focus on what he was saying. Gavin stopped trying to push in and just held himself still inside his lover, allowing him to get used to the feeling of extreme fullness. When his breathing began to even out, Tucker started pushing gently in again while petting Tucker’s cock and kissing his neck. He repositioned them on the bed, bending Tucker over even more until his face was against the sheets. Easing in a well-lubed finger to help lever the knot inside, he was about to despair when with a little plopping sound, the knot slid in deep inside his mate. Tucker grunted, but soon began to moan and pant as his prostate was bathed in the chemicals released from the gland. He arched his back and cried out as an intense orgasm made him scream hoarsely, and try to rear back against Gavin. Gavin licked at the wound on his neck and held him down as his body began to spasm uncontrollably. Tucker was pretty sure he was dying. Didn’t the French call orgasm la petite mort or the little death? He’d read that somewhere, he was sure, but there was nothing little about this. The orgasms never really stopped, just intensified from time to time. He was aware of Gavin wrapped protectively around him, his presence soothing him, but frustrating him at the same time. He wanted to be on top of Gavin so he could have access to all of him, but he was facing away from him, impaled on his cock, and unable to reach him. He twisted his head around for another soulful kiss when the orgasm intensified, making him arch and scream again. He kept waiting for this one to ease off, but it didn’t, only getting worse and worse until darkness teased around the edges of his vision. Too tired to fight it off anymore, he beckoned it and let it slide over him as he sank down onto the bed beneath him. He woke up right in the middle of another orgasm. Fuck! The intensity wasn’t quite as bad this time, so he let it take him over and rode it like a wave. Another, then another and he felt almost like a surfer riding the curl. Years ago, when he graduated high school, his grandparents had paid for his senior trip to Hawaii. Along with five of his closest friends, he’d spent a week on the beaches of Oahu’s North Shore, trying to learn to surf. He was a total floater, rarely getting up the nerve to actually stand on his board in the huge waves. Only once, after watching the locals for hours on the beach, did he get the nerve to really ride a wave. He had come down into a hard bottom turn, or a turn at the bottom of the wave face. When a surfer took off on a steep drop like that, Tucker had been told it was a must situation to make the bottom turn either right or left to get his speed and direction, and then…yeehaw! In his halfdream state, that’s exactly what these orgasms felt like. He’d come down fast and deep and tried to make the bottom turn to ride the next wave. He’d be overcome with pleasure for a few seconds and then he was at the bottom again, trying to head into the next one. All the while, Gavin was whispering to him, soothing him, telling him over and over that he was his lover, his baby, his mate. He must have lost consciousness again, because when he woke the next time, it was over. Gavin was finally pulling out, stroking his back as he tried to calmTucker’s breathing. He bit into his wrist and held it to Tucker’s mouth. “Drink sweetheart. This will make you mine completely.” So tired he couldn’t even argue, Tucker dutifully allowed Gavin to press his wrist against his lips. When Gavin described this process to him, it was the one thing he fought against most— sucking the blood from Gavin’s wrist. Yuck. But surprisingly, as he began to drink, the blood didn’t taste bad to him at all. In fact, it was thick and sweet, almost like the taste and musk of honey. A kind of lassitude came over him, soothing the pain and making him feel boneless and totally relaxed. He was flying again, shreddin’ the gnarl, as one of the California boys on the beach that summer used to say, even higher than before. He soared up over the crest of the wave and came down hard into a total wipeout, tumbling down head over heels into darkness.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bad-moon-on-the-rise-dark-hollow-wolf-pack-7/page-22.html","bookId":2259,"book":{"id":2259,"title":"Bad Moon on the Rise (Dark Hollow Wolf Pack #7)","description":"Storyline: Bad Moon on the Rise (Dark Hollow Wolf Pack #7) Living on the Gulf coast of Florida, Detective Tucker is investigating a series of strange, violent murders.
