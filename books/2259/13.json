Maybe Gavin would have come there, and I could have talked him into going to the hospital.” “Yeah, and maybe not. Maybe he would have come with the rest of his cult members or whatever they are and tried to get you again. Look, Tuck, I’m still not convinced he doesn’t have something to do with the murders. All that crazy talk, the attack on the beach and him trying to tell you that you were some long-lost kin from Tennessee. We found no trace of blood on the beach, by the way, and no witnesses to anything.” “Not exactly kin,” Tucker said, smiling. “Just that he knew my real father and who I ‘really was’ like I was some long-lost royalty or something. I don’t know, Bryson, you had to be there and listen to him. He was really kind of convincing. And he’s not a murderer. I know that much. I’m glad they didn’t find any evidence of anything. It had to be some kind of shared hallucination. Maybe we were both slipped some drug in the club.” “Oh yeah, sure, if you’re thinking with your little head instead of the one on your shoulders! Tuck, you don’t know anything about this guy, except that he tried to hold you prisoner in that room of his and said he wanted to take you with him out of state. Look, we’re still running down the rental car records, and the names his little cult group registered with, but until we find something, I’d feel a lot better if you didn’t go back to your apartment. Just stay here and buy whatever you need to get you through a couple of days until we run them down, okay?” “They’re probably a long way away from here by now,” Tucker said. “Maybe I’ll stay here for a few more days, since both you and the chief insist I stay away from my place, but only for a few more days. I’m not going to let some guy I just met dictate how I live my life.” “I’ll see you later at the station then. Be careful and call me if you need me.” “Yes, Dad,” Tucker said with a grin, ducking away as Bryson turned to shove him good- naturedly. With a wave, he was out the door, and Tucker spent the next few minutes in the bedroom of the luxurious condo, hanging up the few shirts and pants he brought with him in the massive walk-in closet. A knock at the door caught him on the way to the refrigerator to find something to eat. “What did you forget to warn me about now?” he said, a grin already turning up the corners of his mouth. He swung the door wide and then froze in shock at the sight of Gavin standing in the doorway, his big frame tense, hands fisted at his side. “Please don’t slam the door in my face, Tucker. I promise I’m not here to hurt you in any way. I just want the chance to explain things to you.” Tucker’s cheeks were burning, and he knew the stupid blush he always got when he was excited or angry must be staining them right now. He also knew he’d be crazy to let Gavin inside the apartment, but the look of hurt and worry in his beautiful chocolate-brown eyes was making Tucker’s knees shake. He held onto the door knob for support and frowned at Gavin, deliberately making his features as stern as he could. “I’m not afraid of you hurting me, Gavin, and how the hell did you find me here? Are you stalking me?” “I’ll explain everything, if you’ll give me the chance. I know I’ve acted a little odd, but I swear to you I can clear everything up if you’ll give me an opportunity. I want you to understand what’s going on. Please, sweetheart.” When Tucker still hesitated, frowning at him, Gavin held out a hand to him. “If you won’t do it for me, then do it because I have information about your father. Your mother would have wanted you to know about your heritage and about who you really are.” “Are you really going to bring up this bullshit again? I’m not interested in my father! You didn’t know my mother, so don’t even pretend that you did.” Tucker gave Gavin a contemptuous glare, and tightened his hand on the door, ready to slam it in his face, when Gavin’s hand moved to Tucker’s chest. His fingers rested lightly there, and Tucker looked down at them, opening his mouth to tell him to take his fucking hands off him. Instead helooked directly into Gavin’s pleading gaze. “Please Tucker. I’m begging you. Just give me a chance.” Tucker sagged and ran a hand over his face. What he ought to do was pull him inside and once he had him there, try to get him cuffed until he could have him picked up. He was probably in some kind of cult. Or he ran the thing, and was scamming innocent people. Or at the very least, he was deeply disturbed and needed to go to a hospital. “Please, Tucker.” Gavin said the words again softly, “Let me try to explain.” Making a sudden decision, Tucker huffed out a long breath before grabbing Gavin around the back of the neck and dragging him into his arms. Gavin was too tall to lean him back over his arm and ravish him like his cock was insisting he do, so Tucker settled for pulling him into the apartment and slamming him back against the wall. Gavin came willingly, a little groan escaping his lips as Tucker thrust his tongue inside his mouth, sweeping over the inside possessively and pulling away only to nip at his bottom lip. “Damn it, this time I’m going to fuck you. If you want to stay, then get your ass in that bedroom, take off your clothes and lie down across the bed. Now!” Gavin’s eyes went dark and then he grinned at him. “Yes, sir, Lt. Tucker. Anything you say.” He raised one eyebrow inquiringly and Tucker pointed to the bedroom door. As Tucker walked behind him, he admired Gavin’s ass in the tight jeans he was wearing, and unable to resist, he smacked his bottom as he walked through the bedroom door. Gavin turned in surprise and Tucker gave him a little shove. “Move it, Gavin. It’s time to show you a few things.” Gavin gave him an unreadable look, but walked into the bedroom and stood by the bed, taking off his clothes. Holding Tucker’s gaze he toed off his shoes, pulled his T-shirt over his head, then shoved his jeans and underwear down to the floor and stepped out of them, keeping his hands over his cock. Tucker looked at him with surprise. “Modest, baby?” Gavin flushed and dropped his eyes, half-turning toward the bed. “Do you want to fuck me or not?” “Shut your mouth and lie down—face down.” Tucker grabbed his shoulder and flipped him all the way around, pushing him in the small of his back toward the bed. He fell across the bed, his legs hanging off the side. He bounced on the bed before rising on one hand to look in surprise over his shoulder at Tucker, but Tucker pushed him back down. “Oh no, you don’t. I didn’t tell you to move! Now stay there.” Tucker undid the button fly on his pants with hands that were trembling with desire. He didn’t want Gavin to see how much he wanted this, how much he needed it. He shoved his pants and underwear down and stepped out of them, went to his bag, still on the floor and pulled out a small tube of lube he’d put in almost as an afterthought. He drizzled the cool, slippery lube down between Gavin’s ass cheeks, stopping for a moment to admire the round, muscular perfection. He massaged the lube into the crease and enjoyed the needy little sounds coming from Gavin’s throat. “Like that, do you?” Tucker dipped his finger between the crease and found the pink, little hole he was looking for. He eased a well-lubed finger inside. “How about this? Does that feel good?” Gavin stiffened, but nodded, keeping his face turned down toward the mattress. Tucker smacked his bottom again. “I don’t do rhetorical questions. Does that feel good?” “Fuck, yes!” Gavin yelled, and Tucker smiled at the hoarseness in his voice. He added another finger and pumped in and out, twisting every few strokes and ignoring the squirming Gavin was doing. Putting one hand down on the small of his back to keep him still, he searched with his fingers until he found what he was looking for, rubbing his fingers over the spot roughly. Gavin cried out and put both hands down on the bed to try to get up. Tucker pushed him down hard. Stopping long enough to smooth a condom on his own rigid shaft, he stepped up to the edge of the bed behind Gavin, nudging his legs farther apart. He lay down on top of him, his cock on his crease, teasing him. “Ready, baby?” Tucker asked, nipping at Gavin’s shoulder a little. In answer, Gavin gave a tense groan. “Go ahead if you’re going to do this!” His voice sounded ragged and thin. Tucker hesitated, but the idea of Gavin spread out beneath him and ready for him was too much. “Ask me. Ask me to fuck you, big guy.” Gavin was quiet for a long moment before he saidsoftly, “Tucker, will you fuck me?” “Of course, baby. Thought you’d never ask.” Tucker spread him with his fingers and slid inside him, the velvety tightness gripping his cock and squeezing it until he gasped and pulled out a little. “Let me in. Push out,baby! I don’t want to hurt you.” Everything stopped for a long moment, as Tucker tried to catch his breath and slow things down. Gavin was breathing rapidly, his hips trembling with the effort to stay still and both hands gripping the sheet beneath him like a lifeline. A wave of tenderness washed over Tucker. He stretched out over Gavin’s back, and put his hands over his arms, moving his hands gently up and down, massaging and soothing him until he loosened his grip on the sheets. He dropped little kisses all across his back, and moved his hands to stroke his sides. Gradually, Gavin began to relax. Tucker hadn’t moved his cock, poised just inside his entrance, allowing him to get used to the feeling of fullness. “Let me make this good for you, sweetheart. Try to relax. Get up on your knees.” Keeping his head down, Gavin slowly got up to his knees, Tucker moving with him, the tip of his cock still just inside his entrance. Tucker reached beneath his body and took hold of Gavin’s softened cock, gently stroking it as it filled out in his hand. His hand moved downward and came across a strange knot of flesh at the base of his cock. He stopped stroking for a moment, and Gavin tried again to pull away. It occurred to Tucker suddenly that he must have some kind of deformity, and that was why he always kept his hand down covering his cock. A fresh wave of tenderness and concern swept over him. “Let me touch you, baby. It’s okay. Let me love you. I only want to make you feel good.”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bad-moon-on-the-rise-dark-hollow-wolf-pack-7/page-13.html","bookId":2259,"book":{"id":2259,"title":"Bad Moon on the Rise (Dark Hollow Wolf Pack #7)","description":"Storyline: Bad Moon on the Rise (Dark Hollow Wolf Pack #7) Living on the Gulf coast of Florida, Detective Tucker is investigating a series of strange, violent murders.
