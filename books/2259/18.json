The wolves certainly seemed tireless, only stopping for gas and food or to switch drivers. By the time they began climbing into the mountains, it was well after midnight.\n Tucker glanced over at Gavin, and found him wide awake, staring straight ahead and seemingly lost in thought. He must have noticed Tucker’s regard, as he so often did, and turned toward him with a smile. “Nice nap?”\n Tucker shrugged, feeling irritable rather than rested from his fitful sleep. “How much longer till we get there?”\n “We’re almost there. Another twenty minutes, maybe.”\n Tucker straightened up, trying to peer through the windshield to see the road ahead, and succeeding only in falling against Gavin as the SUV took the curves in the road much too fast, in Tucker’s opinion. Gavin immediately scooted over and pulled him into his arms, tucking him against his side. Tucker relaxed into him. He was becoming more and more comfortable with Gavin’s touch. He even found that he liked the possessive way he held him, though he didn’t want to admit it or examine those feelings too closely.\n “It’s pretty late,” Gavin said softly. “Or I should say early. It’s almost one in the morning. I texted your father earlier and told him not to wait up. I think maybe we’ll go to bed as soon as we arrive, and then I can introduce you to everyone in the morning. Sound okay?”\n Tucker nodded, feeling rumpled, grungy and worn out both from the long ride and the overload of stress and emotions of the past few days. He’d like to get some sleep and a shower, and not necessarily in that order before meeting this long-lost father Gavin kept telling him about. He was feeling a little uneasy about meeting this whole packof Gavin’s too, not really knowing what to expect. From what he could understand, the whole group lived together in some huge lodge, almost like a hotel. The idea made him uneasy, thoughts of religious cults and compounds running through his head, with their crazy, despotic leaders like David Koresh and Jim Jones, though there had as yet been no hint of religion in anything Gavin had said.\n Another few miles had them turning off the main highway and onto some kind of graveled road that seemed to lead off into the forest. The trees closed around the SUV protectively as it hurtled along in the dark, traveling for what must have been a couple of miles back into the mountain. Finally, Tucker could make out some lights ahead and they pulled up to a huge log structure, three stories high, from what he could see. Christian, the current driver, pulled right up to the front door by means of a semi-circular driveway before stopping. Gavin got out right away and went to the back to pull out his and Tucker’s suitcases. He motioned for Tucker to follow him and went through the big double doors into the lodge.\n The overall impression of arriving at a hotel remained as they entered what looked like a big lobby, with sofas and chairs scattered around the right side of the room. The only thing missing was the counter where a desk clerk would normally sit. On the left side of the room were tables and chairs, set up like a dining area. Right in the middle was a big staircase leading to the upper floors. At this time of night, the entire area was deserted, though soft lights were burning in several of the lamps.\n “Follow me, Tucker,” Gavin said, leading the way up the staircase to the second floor landing. He turned to the right and led him down the hall to the second door down and opened it, reaching in to flip on a light switch and standing aside to let Tucker precede him. Tucker stepped into a large living room and kitchen area. He could see a room leading off that which presumably led to a bedroom. Again, the impression was that of a luxurious hotel suite, with a lot of dark leather and gleaming appliances in the tiny kitchen.\n Gavin walked past him to the bedroom and Tucker trailed along behind. Gavin set down the suitcases and turned to him. “Shower first or bed?”\n Tucker smiled. “Bed. I’m dead on my feet.” He walked over to the huge king-sized bed and sat down.\n Gavin shifted his feet uncomfortably. “Would you rather I sleep on the sofa?”\n “Of course not, idiot. Let’s just get some sleep and talk in the morning. I’m wasted.” Tucker stripped down to his underwear as he spoke, and pulled back the covers, smiling over at Gavin, who looked immensely relieved. In minutes, they were in bed with Tucker spooning Gavin, who had left a light on in the bathroom, in case Tucker woke up and became disoriented in the strange room. Despite the soft light, Tucker found himself tumbling down into a deep sleep almost as soon as his head hit the pillow.\n He awoke hours later to the sound of a shower running and the smell of coffee, which was almost equally enticing. He sat up in bed just as the bathroom door opened and Gavin emerged, a towel wrapped around his waist and drops of water still glistening on his chest. Tucker leaned back against the headboard to enjoy the view, not wanting to examine the fluttery feelings in his chest too closely as Gavin smiled at him.\n “Morning, sweetheart. I made coffee, but I thought we could go downstairs and join your father for breakfast, if that’s okay. He’s dying to meet you.”\n Feeling sudden little fingers of apprehension up and down his spine, Tucker nevertheless nodded. “Sounds good. Let me grab a quick shower.” Bounding out of bed, he crossed to the bathroom, passing by Gavin and giving him a little squeeze on the ass. He looked back over his shoulder as he shucked out of his underwear and laughed to see Gavin staring after him, openmouthed. He stood under the strong shower spray for at least ten minutes, making sure all the grogginess and stiffness from the long journey the night before was gone before toweling off and using Gavin’s electric razor. Gavin had set outTucker’s toothbrush too, so after brushing his teethand splashing on some of Gavin’s aftershave, he walked back to the bedroom to pull some clothes from his suitcase. He hadn’t brought much with him, having packed mostly shorts when he left for Bryson’s parents’ condo, but finally settled on the only clean pair of tight, dark- washed jeans he had left in his suitcase, a pale blue American Eagle T-shirt that matched his eyes, and his white running shoes.\n Gavin’s eyes roamed over him approvingly as he stepped into the living room. He was also dressed in jeans, topped with a casual button-up white shirt. Tucker thought he looked downright edible and went to his side right away for a kiss. Gavin, who leaned against the kitchen counter sipping his coffee, groaned and put an arm around Tucker’s waist, deepening the kiss. Starting out every morning like this could be a definite perk of staying here.\n “Damn, baby, maybe I should take you back to bed. Your father’s waited this long. A few more minutes won’t kill him.”\n Tucker smiled, but stepped around him, reaching for the empty mug on the counter behind him and pouring himself a cup of coffee. “Maybe later. I think I’m a little nervous right now.”\n “About meeting your dad? Aw, honey, you shouldn’t be—he’s so excited about this.”\n “I know. I am too, but you know, he may not like me, or wish I’d turned out differently or something.”\n Gavin stepped closer and kissed his cheek. “Impossible,” he said softly, making Tucker blush a little, even as he felt a soft, squishy feeling in his chest. Damn, Gavin was becoming important to him, and he still wasn’t sure if that was a good idea or not. He was leaning heavily toward not a good idea, actually.\n “Well, you’re a little prejudiced, being so crazy about me and all,” Tucker said lightly, noticing the slight blush that stained Gavin’s cheeks as he nodded.\n “No doubt,” he said softly, leaning in again for another hungry kiss. Gavin sagged against his chest and put his coffee mug back down on the counter to lean in.\n A loud knock made them jump apart as the door opened and a youngish, dark-haired man walked inside, his gaze instantly roving over Tucker. He was big, like all the wolves, and looked to be in his early thirties. His eyes were a soft brown, and they widened as he stepped closer, reaching for Tucker’s hand, his lips parting in a sweet smile. “Hello, Tucker. I’m your father.”\n “M-my father? But…” Tucker looked up at Gavin for confirmation and found him smiling down at him.\n Tucker’s heart slammed loudly in his chest. He’d known this time was coming, but now it was here, and he still wasn’t ready. This handsome, young guy was somehow his father! A sense of dream-like unreality washed over him, and he blinked his eyes rapidly and swayed a little. Gavin caught his arm to steady him.\n “Steady, sweetheart.Wolves don’t age like humans do, honey, remember? This is Richard. He’s my beta, like I told you. My second in command, and my best friend.”\n Richard smiled at them both shyly, still holding Tucker’s hand, and when he spoke his voice was trembling slightly with emotion. “I never stopped looking for you, James. Never. I wanted you to know that. I don’t blame your grandparents either. Well, not really. Your mother had told them about me only a few weeks before-before the accident. I think they were still frightened. I’m sure they thought they were doing the right thing for you, and from what I’ve been able to find out, they took very good care of you.”\n Tucker looked down at his father’s hand on his. Richard’s gaze followed his, and he quickly dropped it, glancing over at Gavin, as if for help in the face of Tucker’s continuing stunned silence.\n Gavin put his arm around Tucker’s shoulders. “Why don’t we all sit down for a few minutes?”\n “Yes,” Richard said, relieved. “I was going to wait until you brought him down for breakfast, but I didn’t want our first meeting after so long to be quite so public, you know?” He glanced back over at Tucker quickly and then dropped his gaze. Tucker could see how nervous he was, and finally found his voice.\n “I’m glad you did,” he said warmly, shaking his head to clear it.After everything he’d seen so far, this shouldn’t shock him so much. He had to get a grip.“I’m sorry—there have just been so many shocks in the past few days. You look so young! I wasn’t expecting it, though Gavin told me, of course.” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bad-moon-on-the-rise-dark-hollow-wolf-pack-7/page-18.html","bookId":2259,"book":{"id":2259,"title":"Bad Moon on the Rise (Dark Hollow Wolf Pack #7)","description":"Storyline: \n Bad Moon on the Rise (Dark Hollow Wolf Pack #7) \n Living on the Gulf coast of Florida, Detective Tucker is investigating a series of strange, violent murders.
