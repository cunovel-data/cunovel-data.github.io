Laughing faces, eyes full of hope. Shocked faces, mouths hanging open. People start jumping up and down. Clapping. Dancing. Embracing. They start calling out the news, passing the words to others farther down the street, who pass it on to more people farther down the street. And then they dance, until as far as the camera can see, people are dancing in the streets.\n I can literally see the news spreading through them, wiping away despair like a physical wave, and I understand what is happening.\n For the first time in four years, they have been given hope.\n Epilogue\n WARNING: FUGITIVE\n FORMER GOVERNOR JACOBY SONESCHEN\n HAS ESCAPED FROM PRISON\n Age: 48\n Height: 5’9”\n Weight: 150\n Hair: Brown with gray temples\n Other: Recent bullet wound to chest\n Possibly running for Wyoming\n Reward: 8 oz honey for any information\n leading to his recapture \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/stung-stung-1/page-40.html","bookId":1608,"book":{"id":1608,"title":"Stung (Stung #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Stung (Stung #1) \n Fiona doesn’t remember going to sleep. But when she opens her eyes, she discovers her entire world has been altered—her house is abandoned and broken, and the entire neighborhood is barren and dead. Even stranger is the tattoo on her right hand—a black oval with five marks on either side—that she doesn’t remember getting but somehow knows she must cover at any cost. She’s right. \n Those bearing the tattoo have turned into mindless, violent beasts that roam the streets and sewers, preying upon the unbranded while a select few live protected inside a fortress-like wall, their lives devoted to rebuilding society and killing all who bear the mark. \n Now Fiona has awakened branded, alone—and on the wrong side of the wall.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/stung-stung-1.jpg","author":"Bethany Wiggins","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/stung-stung-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:46 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:58:53 PM"}}
