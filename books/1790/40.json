She turned to Caine for assistance. \"Explain Nathan\u0027s wonderful qualities to Sara.\" \"You explain them,\" Caine replied as he reached for another sweet biscuit. That statement earned him another kick under the table. He glared at his wife, then said, \"Nathan\u0027s trustworthy.\" \"He might be trustworthy, but he certainly doesn\u0027t trust anyone else,\" Sara said. She started to fold her napkin. \"The boy\u0027s got courage,\" Jimbo blurted out. He grinned, too, for he was inordinately pleased to have come up with something. \"He\u0027s remarkably… tidy,\" Jade said. Even as she gave that bit of praise she wondered if she was right, Sara neither agreed nor disagreed. Caine decided they were taking the wrong approach. His hand covered Jade\u0027s, and when she looked over at him he gave her a conspiratorial wink. \"Nathan\u0027s probably the most stubborn man I\u0027ve ever known.\" \"He might be a little stubborn,\" Sara immediately countered, \"but that certainly isn\u0027t a sin.\" She turned her gaze to Jade. \"Your brother reminds me of a beautifully sculptured statue. On the outside he\u0027s so handsome, so perfect, but inside his heart is as cold as marble.\" Jade smiled. \"I never considered Nathan beautiful,\" she said. \"Sara can\u0027t possibly consider him beautiful.\" Caine squeezed his wife\u0027s hand before adding, \"Nathan\u0027s an ugly bastard, and everyone knows it. His back is covered with scars, for God\u0027s sake.\" Sara let out a loud gasp, but Caine held his grin. At last they were getting her to show a little emotion. \"It was a woman who scarred Nathan\u0027s back,\" Sara cried out. \"And it was this same woman who scarred his heart.\" She tossed her napkin on the table and stood up. \"Nathan isn\u0027t ugly, sir. He\u0027s incredibly handsome. I think it\u0027s dreadful that his own brother-in-law would say such insulting things about him. Now, if you\u0027ll excuse me, I\u0027d like to go upstairs.\" Jimbo frowned at Caine for upsetting Sara, then chased after her to make certain she did in fact go back above the stairs. \"Caine, you\u0027ve upset her to the point where you\u0027re going to have to apologize,\" Jade told her husband. Just then, Jimbo came rushing back into the dining room. \"Sara\u0027s looking in on the little mite now,\" he said. \"Tell me why you snatched her letter out of my hands. You weren\u0027t thinking I\u0027d actually deliver the thing, were you?\" \"The letter\u0027s in my pocket,\" Caine said. \"I took it from you because I wanted to read it.\" \"Caine that\u0027s an invasion… what did it say?\" Jade asked. \"Just what Sara told us she\u0027d written,\" Caine answered. \"She requests an audience to discuss the contract.\" \"I\u0027m assuming the boy\u0027s put together some sort of plan,\" Jimbo interjected. \"Yes,\" Caine answered. \"What did Sara mean when she said it was a woman who scarred Nathan\u0027s back? Who planted that misinformation in her mind? It was the fire that trapped him inside the prison.\" \"But wasn\u0027t Ariah responsible for having him locked up?\" \"She was,\" Jimbo admitted. \"It happened so many years ago, I doubt Nathan even holds a grudge. He came through it seasoned, to my way of thinking, and we didn\u0027t leave the island without a full booty to share amongst ourselves.\" Caine stood up. \"I\u0027ve got a couple of details of my own to see about. I won\u0027t be home until late, Jade. Sir Richards and I have a little business to discuss.\" \"Why do you need to talk to the director of the War Department?\" she asked. She couldn\u0027t hide her fear. \"Caine, you haven\u0027t started back doing secret work for our government without discussing the matter with me first, have you? You promised—\" \"Hush, love,\" Caine soothed. \"I\u0027m helping Nathan sort out a little matter, that\u0027s all. I\u0027m fully retired and have no desire to return to the cloak-and-dagger days.\" Jade looked relieved. Caine leaned down and kissed her. \"I love you,\" he whispered before he started for the doorway. \"Just one minute,\" Jade called out. \"You still haven\u0027t explained to me why you deliberately riled Sara up. Caine, we already know she loves him. All you have to do is look at her face to know that.\" \"Yes, we know she loves him,\" Caine said. \"I just wanted to remind her,\" he continued. His grin turned devilish. \"Now, if you\u0027ll excuse me, I\u0027ve just thought of a few more endearments, and I want to write them down before I leave.\" He left Jimbo and Jade staring after him. For the first time that day Sara was able to stop thinking about Nathan. Little Olivia took her full attention. She was a beautiful infant. One minute she was smiling and drooling, and the next she was bellowing like an opera singer. Olivia had her mother\u0027s green eyes. The sprinkle of dark hair on her crown looked like it might curl just like her father\u0027s. Sterns hovered by Sara\u0027s side the entire time she held the baby. \"I fear my little love has inherited her Uncle Nathan\u0027s inclination to bellow. She can be as loud as he is,\" Sterns confessed with a smile. \"Olivia\u0027s wanting immediate gratification,\" he explained when the babe began to fret in earnest. He took Olivia back into his arms and held her close. \"Shall we go and find your mama, my little angel?\" he crooned to the infant. Sara was reluctant to go back to her room. It was lonely there, and she knew her problems would once again overpower her. She went to bed early that night, and because she was so emotionally distraught she slept the full night through. She vaguely remembered cuddling up against her husband, knew he had slept next to her, for his side of the bed was still warm, and she came to the sorry conclusion that Nathan was still too angry with her to bother waking her up. He must still believe she\u0027d betrayed him, she thought to herself. Needless to say, that possibility infuriated her all over again. She worked herself into a rage by the time she\u0027d finished her bath. Even though she\u0027d rested long, uninterrupted hours she felt as refreshed as an old, wrung-out hag. She thought she looked like one, too. There were dark half circles under her eyes, and her hair was as limp as her spirits. Sara wanted to look her best when she went to plead with the prince regent. She fretted over which gown to wear, just to take her mind off the real issue at hand, and finally settled on a conservative, high-necked pink walking dress. Like a wallflower at a formal ball Sara sat in the corner of the bedroom all morning long, waiting for the invitation that never arrived. She refused luncheon and spent a good portion of the afternoon pacing her room while she tried to figure out what her next step would be. It was terribly upsetting to her that the prince regent had ignored her urgent request. Caine had been right, she decided, when he\u0027d said that the prince wasn\u0027t interested in the problems of his subjects. Caine knocked on her door then, interrupting her thoughts. \"Sara, we have a little errand to do,\" he said. \"Where are we going?\" she asked. She started to put on her white gloves, then stopped. \"I shouldn\u0027t go out,\" she explained. \"The prince regent might still send word to me.\" \"You have to come with me,\" Caine ordered. \"I don\u0027t have time to explain, Sara. Nathan wants you to meet him at the War Department offices in a half hour\u0027s time.\" \"Why?\" \"I\u0027ll let your husband explain.\" \"Who else is going to be there? Why do we have to meet at the War Department?\" Caine was terribly smooth when it came to evading her questions. Jade was waiting in the foyer. Olivia was draped over her shoulder. \"It\u0027s all going to turn out just fine,\" she told Sara. She was diligently patting her daughter\u0027s back. The baby let out a loud belch. The sound made everyone smile. Caine kissed his wife and daughter good-bye, then gently nudged Sara out the front door. \"I\u0027ll have your gowns pressed and put in the wardrobe while you\u0027re doing this errand,\" Jade said. \"No,\" Sara blurted out. \"I\u0027ll only be staying one more night.\" \"But where will you and Nathan be going?\" Jade asked. Sara didn\u0027t answer her. She turned around and walked down the three steps. Caine held the door to the carriage open. Sara sat across from her brother-in-law. He tried to engage her in casual conversation but quickly gave up when she gave him only whispered yes or no answers. The War Department was situated in a tall, ugly, gray stone building. A musty smell permeated the stairwells. Caine took Sara up to the second floor. \"The meeting\u0027s going to take place in Sir Richards\u0027s office. You\u0027ll like him, Sara. He\u0027s a good man.\" \"I\u0027m certain I will,\" she said, just to be polite. \"But who is he, Caine, and why does he want this meeting?\" \"Richards is the director of the department.\" He opened the door to a large office area and motioned for Sara to go inside. A short, heavy-bellied man was standing behind a desk. He had thin gray hair, a beak nose, and a ruddiness to his complexion. As soon as he looked up from the paper he was holding in his hand and spotted Sara and Caine he started forward. \"There you are now,\" he announced with a smile. \"We\u0027re about ready. Lady Sara, what a pleasure it is to meet you.\" He was such a nice gentleman, she thought. He formally bowed to Sara and then took her hand in his own. \"You must be quite a lady to have captured our Nathan.\" \"She didn\u0027t capture him, Sir Richards,\" Caine interjected with a smile of his own. \"He captured her.\" \"I fear you\u0027re both incorrect,\" Sara whispered. \"King George captured the two of us. Nathan was never given a choice in the matter, but I would like to find a way to—\" Caine wouldn\u0027t let her go on. \"Yes, yes,\" he interrupted. \"You\u0027d like to find Nathan, wouldn\u0027t you? Where is he?\" he asked the director. \"Waiting for the papers,\" Sir Richards explained. \"He\u0027ll be back in just a minute. My assistant is quite speedy. Don\u0027t worry, my dear, it will all be legal.\" She didn\u0027t know what the director was talking about but didn\u0027t want to appear completely ignorant. \"I\u0027m not at all certain why I\u0027m here,\" she admitted. \"I—\" She quit speaking when the side door to the office opened and Nathan walked in. She couldn\u0027t remember what she was saying then, and when the pain in her chest started throbbing she realized she was holding her breath. He didn\u0027t even acknowledge her but strode over to the desk and dropped two papers on top of a stack. Then he walked over to an elongated window seat and stood there staring at her. She couldn\u0027t take her gaze off him. He was a rude, impossible-to-understand, stubborn-headed man whose manners were no better than a hedgehog\u0027s, she thought. A knock sounded at the door, and a young man dressed in a guard\u0027s black uniform looked inside. \"Sir Richards, the prince regent\u0027s carriage is down front,\" he said. Sara heard the announcement, but she still couldn\u0027t take her gaze away from Nathan. He didn\u0027t seem to be at all surprised that the prince was on his way up the steps. He didn\u0027t appear overly nervous either, for he leaned against the wall and continued to look at her. If he wasn\u0027t going to speak to her, then by God, she wasn\u0027t… He crooked his finger at her. She couldn\u0027t believe his arrogance. Both Sir Richards and Caine were in deep discussion over some topic or other. Their low voices were still quite close to her, and she wondered if she\u0027d been included in the conversation. Then Nathan crooked his finger at her again. It would be a burning day in heaven before she obeyed that rude command, she told herself, even as she started walking toward him. He wasn\u0027t smiling at her. He wasn\u0027t scowling either. Nathan looked so serious, so… intense. She stopped when she was facing her husband, just a foot or so away. God help her, she thought, she couldn\u0027t start weeping. He wasn\u0027t making her torment any easier to bear. He looked so damned satisfied. And why shouldn\u0027t he? she asked herself. All the man had to do was crook his finger at her, and she came running. She turned and tried to walk away from him. He reached out and pulled her back. He put his arm around her shoulder and leaned down to whisper in her ear. \"You will have faith in me, wife. Do you understand me?\" She was so astonished by his command, she let out a little gasp. She looked up at him to make certain he wasn\u0027t jesting with her. Then she remembered that Nathan rarely jested about anything. Sara was immediately consumed with an ger. How dare he demand anything from her? At least she had enough faith in him to lose some, she thought to herself. Her eyes filled with tears almost immediately, and all she could think about was getting out of the room before she completely disgraced herself. Nathan suddenly grabbed hold of her chin and forced her to look up at him again. \"You love me, damn it.\" She couldn\u0027t deny it, and so she said nothing at all. He stared at her for a minute. \"And do you know why you love me?\" \"No,\" she answered in a voice to match his. \"Honest to God, Nathan, I haven\u0027t the faintest idea why I love you.\" He wasn\u0027t at all irritated by the anger in her voice. \"You love me, Sara, because I\u0027m everything you could ever want in a husband.\" A tear slipped out from the corner of her eye. He caught it with his thumb. \"Dare you mock me by turning my own words against me? I haven\u0027t forgotten that I said the very same words to you when we set sail for Nora\u0027s island. Love can be destroyed. It\u0027s fragile, and…\" She stopped trying to explain when he shook his head at her. \"You aren\u0027t fragile,\" he told her. \"And your love can\u0027t be destroyed.\" His fingers gently caressed her cheek. \"It\u0027s what I\u0027ve come to value most, Sara. I wasn\u0027t mocking you.\" \"It doesn\u0027t matter,\" she whispered. \"I know you don\u0027t love me. I\u0027ve accepted it, Nathan. Please don\u0027t look so concerned. I don\u0027t fault you. You were never given a choice.\" He couldn\u0027t stand to see her anguish. God, how he wished they were alone so he could take her into his arms and show her how much he loved her. He was going to have to prove himself to her first. \"We\u0027ll discuss this later,\" he announced. \"For now I have but one order, Sara. Don\u0027t you dare give up on me.\" She didn\u0027t understand what he was asking her.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-gift-crown-s-spies-3/page-40.html","bookId":1790,"book":{"id":1790,"title":"The Gift (Crown\u0027s Spies #3)","description":"Storyline: A child bride, Sara Winchester had grown into a winsome beauty, joyfully anticipating the day when her husband Nathan, Marquess of St. James, would return to claim her heart at last.
