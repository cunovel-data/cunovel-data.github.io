{"id":78539,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"She would probably get hysterical on him again, Nathan guessed. He braced himself against the inevitable pleading and weeping and opened the door. Sara wasn\u0027t asleep. As soon as Nathan walked into the cabin she bounded off the bed and stood there with her hands clenched at her sides, facing him. It was apparent she wasn\u0027t quite over her fear or her anger yet. It was damp and stuffy inside the cabin. He shut the door behind him, then walked over to the center of the large square room. He could feel her staring at him when he reached up and lifted the square trap built into the ceiling. He propped the makeshift window open with a stick wedged into the third groove. Fresh sea air and sunlight flooded the cabin. Nathan\u0027s stomach lurched in reaction. He took a deep breath, then walked back over to the door and leaned against it. In the back of his mind lurked the possibility that his bride might just decide to take flight. He wasn\u0027t in any condition to go chasing after her, and therefore he blocked the only exit. Sara stared at Nathan a good long while. She could feel herself shaking and knew it was only a matter of time before her fury got the upper hand. She was determined to hide her anger from him, though, no matter what the cost. Showing any emotion in front of the barbarian would certainly be a poor beginning. The expression on Nathan\u0027s face was one of resignation. His arms were folded in front of his chest, his stance relaxed. She thought he looked bored enough to fall asleep. That didn\u0027t sit well. His intense stare was making her toes curl, too. Sara forced herself to stare back. She wasn\u0027t about to cower in front of him, and if anyone was going to win the rude staring contest, it was going to be she. Nathan thought his bride seemed quite desperate to hide her fear from him. She wasn\u0027t doing a very good job of it, for her eyes were already getting misty, and she was trembling. Lord, he hoped he was up to another round of hysterics. His stomach was railing against the pitch of the ship. Nathan tried to block the feeling and concentrate on the matter at hand. Sara was a beautiful woman. The streamers of sunlight made her hair look more golden than brown. There was a pick of the litter in the Winchester family after all, he thought to himself. She was still dressed in the unappealing dark blue gown. The neckline was too damned low, in his opinion. He thought about mentioning that fact to her later, after she\u0027d gotten rid of some of her fear, but her sudden frown changed his inclination. It was imperative that she understood who was in charge. He stood in the shadows of the door, but she could still see the long, wicked scar running the length of the side of his right arm. The white mark against such bronzed skin was noticeable. Sara stared at it a long minute while she wondered how he\u0027d come by such a horrible injury, then she let out a soft little sigh. He was still dressed in a pair of indecently snug fawn-colored britches. It was a miracle to her that he could even breathe. His white shirt was unbuttoned to the waist, the cuffs rolled up to his elbows, and the casualness of his attire irritated her almost as much as his sudden frown. She thought about waiting until later to tell him that one simply didn\u0027t wear such unseemly attire when one was traveling aboard such a fine vessel, but his intense frown changed her inclination. It was imperative that he understand what was expected of him now that he was married. \"You dress like a tavern wench.\" It took a full minute for the insult to penetrate. At first Sara was too astonished to react. Then she let out a loud gasp. Nathan hid his smile. Sara didn\u0027t look as if she was going to weep. In truth, she looked like she wanted to kill him. It was a nice beginning. \"You\u0027re falling out of your neckline, bride.\" Her hands immediately covered the top of her gown. Her face was flaming red in the space of a heartbeat. \"It was the only dress that was dark enough to conceal me when I walked along…\" She stopped her explanation as soon as she realized she was actually defending herself. \"Conceal?\" Nathan drawled. \"Sara, it doesn\u0027t conceal anything. In future you will not wear such revealing gowns. The only one who sees your body will be me. Do you understand me?\" Oh, she understood all right. The man was a cad, she concluded. How easily he\u0027d turned the tables on her, too. Sara shook her head. She wasn\u0027t about to let him put her in such a vulnerable position when he had so much accounting to do. \"You look like a barbarian,\" she blurted out. \"Your hair\u0027s much longer than is fashionable, and you dress like a… villain. Guests traveling aboard such a fine boat should keep their appearances impeccable. You look like you\u0027ve just carried in the crops,\" she added with a nod. \"And your scowl is downright ugly.\" Nathan decided he was finished with foolish banter and homed in on the true matter at hand. \"All right, Sara,\" he began. \"Get it over and done with.\" \"Get what over and done with?\" His sigh was long, weary, absolutely infuriating to her. She desperately tried to hold onto her temper, but the urge to shout at him was making her head pound and her throat ache. Her eyes stung with tears. He had so much explaining to do before she would ever consider forgiving him, she thought, and he had damn well better get on with it before she decided his sins were too mortal ever to be forgiven at all. \"The fit of weeping and begging,\" Nathan explained with a shrug. \"It\u0027s obvious to me that you\u0027re afraid,\" he continued. \"You\u0027re about to start crying, aren\u0027t you? I know you must want me to take you back home, Sara. I\u0027ve decided to save you the humiliation of pleading by simply explaining that no matter what you say or do, you\u0027re staying with me. I\u0027m your husband, Sara. Get used to it.\" \"Will it bother you if I weep?\" she asked in a voice that sounded like someone was choking her. \"Not in the least,\" he said. It was a lie, of course, for it would bother him to see her upset, yet he wasn\u0027t about to admit to that fact. Women generally used that kind of information against a man and burst into tears every time they wanted something. Sara took a deep breath. She didn\u0027t dare speak another word until she\u0027d gained control of herself. Did he actually think she would beg? By God, he was a horrid man. Intimidating, too. He didn\u0027t seem to possess an ounce of compassion. She continued to stare at him while she gathered her courage to ask him all the painful questions she\u0027d stored up inside her for such a long time. She doubted that he would tell her the truth, but she still wanted to hear what he had to say for himself. He thought she looked ready to cry. Sara was apparently back to being terrified of him, he decided. Hell, he hoped she wouldn\u0027t faint again. He had little patience with the weaker sex, yet found he didn\u0027t want Sara to be too frightened of him. In truth, he felt a little sorry for her. She couldn\u0027t possibly want to be married to him. He was a St. James, after all, and she had been raised a Winchester. She had certainly been trained to hate him. Poor Sara was just a victim in the scheme, a pawn the daft king had used to try to right the differences between the two feuding families. Still, he couldn\u0027t undo the past for her. His signature was on that contract, and he was bound and determined to honor it. \"You might as well understand that I\u0027m not going to walk away from this marriage,\" he stated in a hard voice. \"Not now, not ever.\" After making that statement he patiently waited for the fit of hysterics sure to come. \"What took you so long?\" She\u0027d spoken in such a soft whisper, he wasn\u0027t certain he heard her correctly. \"What did you say?\" \"Why did you wait so long?\" she asked him in a much stronger voice. \"Wait so long to do what?\" He looked completely bewildered to her. She took another deep breath. \"To come for me,\" she explained. Her voice shook. She gripped her hands together in a bid to hang onto her temper, then said, \"Why did you wait so long to come and get me?\" He was so surprised by her question, he didn\u0027t immediately respond. That Nathan didn\u0027t even think she merited a response was the last blow to her pride that Sara was going to take. In a near shout Sara demanded, \"Do you have any idea how long I\u0027ve waited for you?\" His eyes widened in surprise. His bride had just shouted at him. He stared at her in a way that made her think he thought she\u0027d lost her mind. And then he slowly shook his head at her. Her composure shattered. \"No?\" she shouted. \"Was I so insignificant to you that you couldn\u0027t even be bothered getting around to the chore of coming for me?\" Nathan was stunned by her questions. He knew he shouldn\u0027t let her raise her voice to him, but her comments so astonished him, he wasn\u0027t certain what to say. \"You actually want me to believe you\u0027re angry because I didn\u0027t come for you sooner?\" he asked. Sara picked up the nearest object she could get her hands on and threw it at him. Fortunately, the chamberpot was empty. \"Angry?\" she asked in a roar worthy of a commander. \"What makes you think I\u0027m angry, Nathan?\" He dodged the chamberpot and the two candles that followed, then leaned back against the door. \"Oh, I don\u0027t know,\" he drawled. \"You seem troubled.\" \"I seem…\" She was too incensed to stammer out another word. Nathan\u0027s grin was in full evidence when he nodded. \"Troubled,\" he finished for her. \"Do you own a pistol?\" \"Yes.\" \"May I borrow it?\" He forced himself not to laugh. \"Now why would you want to borrow my pistol, Sara?\" \"I want to shoot you, Nathan.\" He did laugh then. Sara decided she hated him. The bluster went out of her. She wanted to weep with frustration. Perhaps her relatives had been right after all. Perhaps he did despise her, maybe even as much as her parents told her he would. She gave up the battle and sat down on the bed again. She folded her hands in her lap and kept her gaze downcast. \"Please leave my cabin. If you wish to explain your sorry conduct to me, you may do so tomorrow. I\u0027m too weary to listen to your excuses now.\" He couldn\u0027t believe what he was hearing. She dared to give him orders. \"That isn\u0027t how our marriage works, Sara. I give the orders, and you obey them.\" His voice had been hard, angry. It was deliberate, of course, for he wanted her to understand he meant what he said. He thought he was probably frightening her again. She started wringing her hands in obvious agitation, and though he felt a bit guilty because he had to resort to such intimidating tactics, the issue was far too important to soften his approach. Nathan promised himself that no matter how pitiful she looked or sounded when she started crying, he would not back down. Sara continued to wring her hands for a long minute, pretending that it was her husband\u0027s stubborn neck she had between her fingers. The fantasy helped to lighten her mood. Nathan nagged her back to reality when he growled, \"Did you hear me, bride?\" God, she hated the name \"bride!\" \"Yes, I heard you,\" she answered. \"But I don\u0027t really understand. Why is that how this marriage works?\" The tears were back in her eyes again. Nathan suddenly felt like an ogre. \"Are you trying to bait me?\" he asked. She shook her head. \"No,\" she answered. \"I just supposed our marriage was going to go along in the opposite direction. Yes, I always did,\" she added in a rush when he frowned intently at her. \"Oh? And just how did you think this marriage was going to go along?\" He actually seemed to be interested in her opinion. Sara immediately took heart. She lifted her shoulders in a dainty shrug. \"Well, I supposed that it would always be my duty to tell you what I wanted.\" \"And?\" he prodded when she quit her explanation. \"And it would always be your duty to get it for me.\" She could tell from his dark expression he didn\u0027t like hearing that opinion. She could feel herself getting riled up again. \"You\u0027re supposed to cherish me, Nathan. You did promise.\" \"I did not promise to cherish you,\" he countered in a shout. \"For God\u0027s sake, woman, I didn\u0027t promise you anything.\" She wasn\u0027t about to let him get away with that lie. She jumped to her feet to confront him again. \"Oh, yes, you did promise,\" she shouted back. \"I read the contract, Nathan, from start to finish. In return for the land and the treasury you\u0027re supposed to keep me safe. You\u0027re also supposed to be a good husband, a kind father, and most of all, Viking, you\u0027re supposed to love and cherish me.\" He was at a loss for words. He suddenly felt like laughing again. The twisted turn in the topic was exasperating. Exhilarating, too. \"You really want me to love and cherish you?\" \"I most certainly do,\" she replied. She folded her arms across her chest. \"You promised to love and cherish me, Nathan, and by God, you\u0027re going to.\" She sat down on the bed again and took her time straightening the folds in her gown. The blush that covered her cheeks told of her embarrassment. \"And what are you supposed to be doing while I\u0027m loving and cherishing you?\" he asked. \"What are your promises, bride?\" \"I didn\u0027t promise anything,\" she answered. \"I was only four years old, Nathan. I didn\u0027t sign the contract. You did.\" He closed his eyes and counted to ten. \"Then you don\u0027t believe you have to honor your father\u0027s signature? The promises he made on your behalf aren\u0027t binding?\" \"I didn\u0027t say that,\" she whispered. She let out a loud sigh, then added, \"Of course I will honor them. They were given in my name.\" \"And what are they?\" he demanded. She took a long time answering him. She looked thoroughly disgruntled, too. \"I have to love and cherish you, too,\" she muttered. He wasn\u0027t satisfied. \"And?\" \"And what?\" she asked, pretending ignorance. He decided then and there that his bride was trying to make him crazed. \"I also read the contract through from start to finish,\" he snapped. \"Don\u0027t try my patience.\" \"Oh, all right,\" she countered. \"I have to obey you, too. There, are you happy now?\" \"Yes,\" he returned. \"We\u0027re now back where we started,\" he said then. \"As I instructed you before, I will be the one to give the orders, and you will be the one to obey them. And don\u0027t you dare ask me why again.\" \"I will try to obey your orders, Nathan, when I think they\u0027re reasonable.\" His tolerance was at an end. \"I don\u0027t give a damn if you think they\u0027re reasonable or not,\" he roared. \"You will do as I say.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-gift-crown-s-spies-3/page-8.html","bookId":1790,"book":{"id":1790,"title":"The Gift (Crown\u0027s Spies #3)","description":"Storyline: A child bride, Sara Winchester had grown into a winsome beauty, joyfully anticipating the day when her husband Nathan, Marquess of St. James, would return to claim her heart at last.
