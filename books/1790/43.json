{"id":78574,"no":43,"title":"Page 43","content":"She rested the side of her face against his chest. The hammering of his heart indicated that her soothing words hadn\u0027t calmed him at all. Yet his voice was deceptively calm when he asked, \"Did you have the walking stick, or did he?\"\n \"He had the stick when he started up the steps to get me,\" she explained. \"He grabbed it from the umbrella stand.\"\n Nathan pictured it in his mind. He tried to peel her hands away. \"Nathan? It\u0027s over now. He didn\u0027t strike me.\"\n \"Did he try?\"\n She felt as if she were clinging to a statue, so rigid had his stance become. She let out a little sigh, increased her hold on him, and then answered, \"Yes, but I wouldn\u0027t let him hit me. I remembered your instructions, and I evened the odds, just as you promised I would in such a situation. As to that,\" she added, \"I also had the element of surprise on my side. Uncle Henry isn\u0027t at all used to having women defend themselves. He looked… astonished when he fell backwards.\"\n \"Caine? Take Sara outside and wait for me. Richards, go with them.\"\n All three of them told Nathan no at the same time. They all had different reasons. Caine didn\u0027t want the mess of getting rid of the body. Sara didn\u0027t want Nathan to go to the gallows. Sir Richards didn\u0027t want the paperwork.\n Nathan was still rigid with fury when they\u0027d finished giving him their arguments. He couldn\u0027t get Sara out of his arms long enough to rip the Winchester bastard apart. He found the situation extremely frustrating. \"Damn it, Sara, if you\u0027ll just let me—\"\n \"No, Nathan.\"\n His sigh was long. She knew she\u0027d won. She was suddenly in a hurry to get him alone so that she could win another victory. Come hell or his hide, she would get him to tell her he loved her.\n \"Nathan, we can\u0027t leave until I know Mama\u0027s going to be safe,\" she whispered. \"But I want to go home with you now. What are you going to do about this problem?\" She didn\u0027t give him time to answer. \"I meant to say, Nathan, what are we going to do about this problem?\"\n Her husband wasn\u0027t one to give up easily. He still wanted to kill her uncle. He considered his plan a perfectly logical one. It would not only eliminate Sara\u0027s worry about her mother\u0027s safety, but it would also give him the tremendous satisfaction of putting his fist through the man\u0027s face. He kept staring at the walking stick and thinking of the damage a man could inflict with such a weapon. Henry could have killed her.\n Caine came up with a nice solution. \"You know, Nathan, Henry looks in need of a long rest. Perhaps a sea voyage to the colonies would be just the ticket to improve his health.\"\n Nathan\u0027s mood immediately brightened. \"See to it, Caine.\"\n \"I\u0027ll give him to Colin and let him arrange the details,\" Caine said. He lifted Henry up by the nape of his neck. \"A few ropes and a gag are all the baggage he\u0027ll be needing.\"\n Sir Richards nodded agreement. \"I\u0027ll wait here until your mother returns, Sara. I\u0027ll explain that your uncle had a sudden desire to take a long trip. I\u0027m also going to wait for your father. I want to have a few words with him, too. Why don\u0027t you and Nathan run along now? Take my carriage and have my driver return for me later.\"\n Henry Winchester had regained enough of his sensibilities to make a doubled-over dash for the doorway. Caine deliberately shoved him toward his brother-in-law.\n Nathan seized his opportunity. He slammed the back of his fist into Henry\u0027s stomach. The blow sent Sara\u0027s uncle back to the floor for another bout of writhing.\n \"Feel better, Nathan?\" Caine asked.\n \"Immensely,\" Nathan answered.\n \"What about the papers you had drawn up?\" Sir Richards asked Nathan.\n \"Bring them to Farnmount\u0027s ball tonight. We\u0027ll borrow Lester\u0027s library for a few minutes. Sara and I should get there around nine.\"\n \"I\u0027ll have to go back to the office to fetch them,\" the director said. \"Set the meeting for ten, Nathan, just to be on the safe side.\"\n \"May I ask what it is you\u0027re discussing?\" Sara interjected.\n \"No.\"\n Her husband\u0027s abrupt answer irritated her. \"I don\u0027t want to go out tonight,\" she announced. \"I have something most important to discuss with you.\"\n He shook his head. \"You will have faith in me, woman,\" he muttered as he dragged her out the doorway.\n She let out a gasp. \"Of all the galling things to say to me…\"\n She stopped when he turned and lifted her into the carriage. His expression looked bleak. She noticed his hands were shaking, too.\n He wouldn\u0027t let her sit next to him but took his place across from her. When he stretched out his long legs she was trapped between them.\n As soon as the carriage started forward he turned and stared out the window.\n \"Nathan?\"\n \"Yes?\"\n \"Are you having… aftermath now?\"\n \"No.\"\n She was disappointed, for she hoped he\u0027d need to vent his frustration the way she had when she\u0027d experienced aftermath. The memory of just how her husband had helped her get over her tension made her face turn pink.\n \"Don\u0027t men have aftermath after they fight?\"\n \"Some do. I shouldn\u0027t have hit Henry in front of you,\" he said. He still wouldn\u0027t look at her.\n \"Do you mean that if I hadn\u0027t been there, you wouldn\u0027t have hit him, or that you regret—\"\n \"Hell, yes, I would have hit him,\" Nathan muttered. \"I just shouldn\u0027t have struck the bastard in front of you.\"\n \"Why?\"\n \"You\u0027re my wife,\" he explained. \"You shouldn\u0027t be a witness to… violence. In future I will refrain from—\"\n \"Nathan,\" she interrupted, \"I didn\u0027t mind. Truly. There are times when it will happen again. I am opposed to violence,\" she added in a rush, \"but I will admit that there are times when a sound punch is just the thing. It can be quite invigorating.\"\n He shook his head. \"You wouldn\u0027t let me kill the pirates, remember?\"\n \"I let you hit them.\"\n He shrugged. Then he let out a loud sigh. \"You are a lady. You\u0027re delicate and feminine, and I will behave like a gentleman when I\u0027m with you. That\u0027s the way it\u0027s going to be, Sara. Don\u0027t argue with me.\"\n \"You\u0027ve always been a gentleman with me,\" she whispered.\n \"The hell I have,\" he countered. \"I\u0027ll change, Sara. Now cease this talk. I\u0027m trying to think.\"\n \"Nathan? Were you worried about me?\"\n \"Hell, yes, I was worried.\"\n He\u0027d bellowed his answer. She held her smile. \"I really would like you to kiss me.\"\n He didn\u0027t even look at her when he responded, \"No.\"\n \"Why not?\"\n \"It has to be right, Sara.\"\n What in heaven\u0027s name did that mean? \"It\u0027s always right when you kiss me.\"\n \"I\u0027ll ruin everything if I kiss you.\"\n \"You aren\u0027t making any sense.\"\n \"Tell me what happened with Henry,\" he ordered.\n She let out a little sigh. \"I hit him… there.\"\n A soft smile changed his frown. \"Did you remember how to make a proper fist?\"\n She decided she wouldn\u0027t answer him until he looked at her. A long moment passed before he finally gave in.\n He was fighting one hell of a battle to keep his hands off her. He thought he was winning the fight, too, until she smiled at him and whispered, \"I knew you would be proud of me. Most gentlemen would have been appalled, though.\"\n He roughly pulled her into his lap. His fingers were already twisting into her hair. \"I\u0027m not most,\" he said an instant before his mouth came down on hers. His tongue swept inside her mouth to taste, to caress, to tease. He couldn\u0027t get enough of her, couldn\u0027t get close enough, soon enough.\n He kissed the side of her neck while he worked on the buttons at the back of her dress. \"I knew if I touched you, I wouldn\u0027t be able to stop.\"\n He\u0027d lost all control. The carriage stopped, but only Sara realized that fact. She made him button her up again. It took him much longer, for his hands were shaking.\n Nathan dragged her by her hand inside the townhouse. Jade smiled at the couple when they went flying up the stairs.\n Nathan regained a little of his control by the time they reached their bedroom. He opened the door for her. Sara was already reaching behind her back to get the buttons undone again on her way over to the bed. She stopped when she heard the door slam.\n She turned around to find that she was all alone. Nathan had left her. She was too astonished to react for several minutes. Then she let out an outraged scream. She pulled the door open and went running down the hallway.\n Jade caught her at the landing. \"Nathan just left. He said to tell you to be ready to leave by eight. He also suggested I lend you a gown, since your trunk is still on board the Seahawk.\"\n \"How could he have told you all that and have left already?\"\n Jade smiled. \"My brother acted as though he had the devil on his tail,\" she said. \"He finished his instructions from the walkway out front. He\u0027s going to meet us later, Sara. He must have some business to attend to—at least I think that\u0027s what he added when he jumped into Caine\u0027s carriage and took off.\"\n Sara shook her head. \"Your brother is rude, inconsiderate, arrogant, stubborn…\"\n \"And you love him.\"\n Her shoulders sagged. \"Yes, I love him. I believe he might love me, too,\" she added in a mutter. \"He might not truly realize it yet, or he might just be a little afraid. Oh, I don\u0027t know anymore. Yes, of course he loves me. How can you believe he doesn\u0027t?\"\n \"I\u0027m not arguing with you, Sara. I believe Nathan loves you, too,\" she added with a nod. \"It\u0027s quite obvious to me, as a matter of fact. He\u0027s so… rattled. He\u0027s always been a man of few words, but now he doesn\u0027t even make sense when he mutters.\"\n Sara\u0027s eyes filled with tears. \"I want him to tell me he loves me,\" she whispered.\n Jade was full of sympathy. She patted Sara\u0027s hand and led her to her bedroom.\n \"Do you know that I\u0027m everything Nathan could ever want in a wife? No one could love him as much as I do. Please don\u0027t consider me inferior. I\u0027m really not. I\u0027m just very different from you, Jade.\"\n Nathan\u0027s sister turned from the wardrobe to stare incredulously at Sara. \"Why would you think I would ever consider you inferior?\"\n Sara stammered out her explanation of how the men on board the Seahawk had constantly compared her to Jade, and how she\u0027d always lost the contest. \"And then the pirates attacked, and I was able to redeem myself in their eyes.\"\n \"I would imagine so,\" Jade agreed.\n \"I also have courage,\" Sara said. \"I\u0027m not boasting, Jade. Nathan did convince me that I\u0027m very courageous.\"\n \"We\u0027re both loyal to our husbands, too,\" Jade said. She turned back to her wardrobe and continued to sort through, looking for an appropriate gown.\n \"Nathan only likes me to wear high-necked gowns,\" Sara said.\n \"That\u0027s telling, isn\u0027t it?\"\n \"I usually try to be accommodating.\"\n Jade didn\u0027t dare let Sara see her expression. The anger in her sister-in-law\u0027s voice made her want to laugh. The poor love was getting all worked up again.\n \"Perhaps, Jade, that is the problem,\" Sara announced. \"I\u0027ve been too accommodating. I\u0027m always telling Nathan how much I love him. And do you know what his answer always is?\" She didn\u0027t give Jade time to guess. \"He grunts. Honest to God, that\u0027s what he does. Well, no more, thank you.\"\n \"No more grunting?\" Jade asked.\n \"No more accommodating. Find me the lowest-cut gown in your closet.\"\n Jade did laugh then. \"That should push Nathan right over the edge.\"\n \"I do hope so,\" Sara answered.\n Five minutes later Sara held an ivory-colored gown in her arms.\n \"I only wore the dress once, and not out of the house, so no one\u0027s seen it. Caine wouldn\u0027t let me keep it on.\"\n Sara loved the gown. She thanked Jade several times, then started out of the room. She suddenly stopped and turned around. \"May I ask you something?\"\n \"We\u0027re sisters now, Sara. You may ask me anything.\"\n \"Do you ever cry?\"\n Jade hadn\u0027t expected that question. \"Yes,\" she answered. \"All the time, as a matter of fact.\"\n \"Has Nathan ever seen you cry?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know if he has or not.\"\n From Sara\u0027s crestfallen expression Jade realized that wasn\u0027t the answer she was hoping for. \"Now that I think about it, yes, he has seen me cry. Not as often as Caine, of course.\"\n \"Oh, thank you for sharing that confidence with me. You have no idea how happy you\u0027ve just made me.\"\n Sara\u0027s smile was radiant. Jade was pleased, though she admitted to herself she still didn\u0027t know exactly what Sara was so thrilled about.\n Two hours later Jade and Caine patiently waited in the foyer for Sara to make her appearance. Jimbo paced back and forth by the front door.\n Jade was dressed in a dark green silk gown with embroidered cap sleeves. The neckline showed only the barest hint of bosom. Caine still frowned over it before he muttered that she looked beautiful. He wore his formal attire, and she told him he was the most handsome devil in the world. Then Jimbo started nagging them about making certain someone stayed by Sara\u0027s side all evening.\n \"Don\u0027t let her out of your sight until Nathan shows up to take over,\" Jimbo ordered for the fifth time.\n Sara drew everyone\u0027s attention when she started down the steps. Jimbo let out a low whistle. \"Nathan\u0027s going to see red when he gets a look at our Sara.\"\n Both Jade and Caine agreed. Sara looked magnificent. Her hair was unbound, and the soft curls swayed about her shoulders with each step she took.\n The virginal-colored dress was extremely low-cut and ended in a deep V between her br**sts. It was the most provocative gown Caine had ever seen. He remembered it, too. \"I thought I tore that thing when I helped you get undressed,\" he whispered.\n His wife blushed. \"You were in a hurry, but you didn\u0027t tear it.\"\n \"Nathan\u0027s going to,\" Caine whispered back.\n \"Then you think my brother will like it?\"\n \"Hell, no, he won\u0027t like it,\" Caine predicted.\n \"Good.\"\n \"Jade, sweet, I\u0027m not so certain this is such a good idea. Every man at the ball is going to be lusting after Sara. Nathan\u0027s going to have a fit.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-gift-crown-s-spies-3/page-43.html","bookId":1790,"book":{"id":1790,"title":"The Gift (Crown\u0027s Spies #3)","description":"Storyline: \n A child bride, Sara Winchester had grown into a winsome beauty, joyfully anticipating the day when her husband Nathan, Marquess of St. James, would return to claim her heart at last.
