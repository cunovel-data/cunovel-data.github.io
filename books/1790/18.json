Sara placed a chaste kiss on his mouth, then leaned back. \"This would feel much better if you cooperated, Nathan. You\u0027re supposed to kiss me back.\"\\n\\n Her voice was low, sensual, as soft as her warm body pressed against his. A man could only take so much teasing. Nathan lowered his head and slowly rubbed his mouth over hers. He caught her sigh when he opened her mouth and deepened the kiss.\\n\\n She was already melting in his arms. He was once again nearly undone by her easy response to his touch. His tongue dueled with hers, and he couldn\u0027t contain his low growl of pleasure.\\n\\n When he finally pulled back from her she slumped against him. He couldn\u0027t stop himself from putting his arms around her and holding her tight. She smelled like roses and cinnamon.\\n\\n \"Who taught you how to kiss?\" he demanded in a rough whisper. It was an illogical question, he supposed, given the fact that she\u0027d been a virgin when he\u0027d taken her to his bed, but he was compelled to ask anyway.\\n\\n \"You taught me how to kiss,\" she answered.\\n\\n \"You never kissed anyone before me?\"\\n\\n She shook her head. His anger dissipated in a flash. \"If you don\u0027t like the way I kiss…\" she began.\\n\\n \"I like it.\"\\n\\n She quit protesting.\\n\\n He suddenly pulled completely away from her, grabbed hold of her hand, and dragged her over to the candles. He blew both flames out and then headed for the corridor.\\n\\n \"Nathan, I can\u0027t leave the galley,\" she announced.\\n\\n \"You need a nap.\"\\n\\n \"I what? I never take naps.\"\\n\\n \"You do now.\"\\n\\n \"But what about my lovely soup?\"\\n\\n \"Damn it, Sara, I don\u0027t want you cooking again.\"\\n\\n She frowned at his broad back. Lord, he was bossy. \"I already explained why I took on this duty,\" she muttered.\\n\\n \"Do you think you can win the men\u0027s loyalty with a bowl of slop?\"\\n\\n If he slowed down just a little, she thought, she would be able to kick him in the back of his legs. \"It isn\u0027t slop,\" she shouted instead.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t argue with her. He continued to drag her along all the way back to their cabin. She was a bit surprised when he followed her inside.\\n\\n He shut the door behind him and bolted it.\\n\\n \"Turn around, Sara.\"\\n\\n She gave him a good frown for being so dictatorial, then did as he commanded. He was much quicker unbuttoning the gown than he had been the last time.\\n\\n \"I really don\u0027t want to have a nap,\" she told him again.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t quit prodding her until her gown fell to the floor. It still hadn\u0027t dawned on her that he really wasn\u0027t interested in forcing her to sleep. He stripped her down to her chemise, but when he tried to remove that garment she pushed his hands away.\\n\\n Nathan stared at her a long minute. Her body was simply perfection to him. Her br**sts were full, her waist narrow, and her legs long, shapely, exquisite.\\n\\n His hot stare soon made her uncomfortable. Sara tugged on the straps of her chemise, trying without much success to conceal a little more of her br**sts.\\n\\n She quit feeling embarrassed when he unbuttoned his shirt. That action gained her full attention. \"Are you taking a nap, too?\"\\n\\n \"I never take naps.\"\\n\\n He tossed his shirt aside, leaned back against the door, and began to pull his boots off. Sara backed up a space.\\n\\n \"You aren\u0027t just changing your clothes, are you?\"\\n\\n His grin was lopsided, endearing. \"No.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t want to…\"\\n\\n He didn\u0027t look at her when he answered. \"Oh, yes, I want to,\" he drawled.\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n His reaction was immediate. He stood to his full height and walked toward her. His hands were on his hips. \"No?\"\\n\\n She shook her head.\\n\\n \"Why the hell not?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s daylight,\" she blurted out.\\n\\n \"Damn it, Sara, you aren\u0027t afraid again, are you? Honest to God, I don\u0027t think I can go through that ordeal again.\"\\n\\n She was outraged. \"Ordeal? You call making love to me an ordeal?\"\\n\\n He wasn\u0027t going to let her stray from answering his question. \"Are you afraid?\" he demanded.\\n\\n He looked as though he dreaded her answer. Sara suddenly realized she had a way out if she wanted it, but she immediately discarded that idea. She wasn\u0027t going to lie to him.\\n\\n \"I wasn\u0027t afraid last night,\" she announced. She folded her arms across her chest and then added, \"You were.\"\\n\\n That remark wasn\u0027t worthy of a retort. \"You said you didn\u0027t hurt anymore,\" he reminded her as he moved forward another step.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not tender now,\" she whispered. \"But we both know I will be if you persist in getting your way, Nathan.\"\\n\\n His smile indicated his amusement. \"Will that be so unbearable?\"\\n\\n A warm knot was already forming in the pit of her stomach. All the man had to do was look at her in that special way of his and she came apart.\\n\\n \"Are you going to want to… move again?\"\\n\\n He didn\u0027t laugh. She looked so worried, and he didn\u0027t want her to think he was mocking her feelings. He wasn\u0027t going to lie, either. \"Yeah,\" he drawled as he reached for her. \"I\u0027m going to want to move again.\"\\n\\n \"Then we aren\u0027t going to do anything but nap.\"\\n\\n The little woman really needed to understand who was husband and who was wife, Nathan thought to himself. He decided he\u0027d explain all about her duty to obey him later. All he wanted to do was kiss her. He threw his arm around her shoulders, dragged her over to the trap, and didn\u0027t let go of her when he reached up and pulled the wooden door shut.\\n\\n The cabin was pitched into darkness. Nathan paused to kiss Sara. It was a hot, wet, lingering kiss that let her know with certainty that he was going to get his way.\\n\\n Then he turned to light the candles. Her hand stayed his action. \"Don\u0027t,\" she whispered.\\n\\n \"I want to see you when you…\"\\n\\n He stopped his explanation when he felt her hands on his waistband. Sara\u0027s hands were shaking, but she got the buttons to his breeches undone in little time. Her fingers brushed against his hard stomach. His indrawn breath told her he liked that. It made her bolder. She rested the side of her face against his chest, then slowly edged the waistband down. \"You wanted to see me when I what, Nathan?\" she whispered.\\n\\n It took all he had to concentrate on what she was saying. Her fingers were slowly easing their way down toward his groin. He closed his eyes in sweet agony.\\n\\n \"When you find fulfillment,\" he said on a low groan. \"God, Sara, touch me.\"\\n\\n His body was rigid now. Sara smiled to herself. She had no idea her touch could so arouse him. She pushed his clothing down a little further. \"I am touching you, Nathan.\"\\n\\n He couldn\u0027t take the torment any longer. He took hold of her hand and placed it where he needed her touch most.\\n\\n She wanted to stroke him. He wouldn\u0027t let her. His growl was deep, guttural. \"Don\u0027t,\" he ordered. \"Just hold me, squeeze me, but don\u0027t… oh, God, Sara, stop now.\"\\n\\n He sounded as if he was in pain. She pulled her hand away. \"Am I hurting you?\" she whispered.\\n\\n He kissed her again. She put her arms around his neck and held him close. When he moved to the side of her neck and began to place wet kisses below her earlobe she tried to touch his hard arousal again.\\n\\n He took hold of her hand and put it on his waist. \"It\u0027s too soon for me to lose my control,\" he whispered. \"You make it unbearable.\"\\n\\n She kissed the base of his neck. \"Then I won\u0027t touch you there, Nathan, if you promise not to move around so much when you make love to me.\"\\n\\n He laughed. \"You\u0027ll want me to move,\" he told her.\\n\\n He pulled her back up against his chest. \"You know what, Sara?\" he said between fervent kisses.\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve decided I\u0027m going to make you beg.\"\\n\\n He was as good as his word. By the time the two of them were in bed and he was settled between her thighs she was begging him to end the sweet torment.\\n\\n The fire of passion inside her was completely out of control. Nathan did hurt her when he finally moved inside her. She was so tight, so hot, it was blissful agony for him to slow down. He tried to be a gentle lover, knowing how tender she was, and he didn\u0027t move at all until she began to writhe underneath him.\\n\\n She found her release before he did, and her tremors gave him his own orgasm. He hadn\u0027t spoken a word during the mating. She never quit talking. She rambled on and on, tender words of love. Some made sense. Others didn\u0027t.\\n\\n When he finally collapsed on top of her, when he finally regained his ability to think at all, he realized she was crying.\\n\\n \"God, Sara, did I hurt you again?\"\\n\\n \"Only a little,\" she whispered shyly.\\n\\n He leaned up to look into her eyes. \"Then why are you crying?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know why,\" she answered. \"It was so… amazing, and I was so…\"\\n\\n He stopped her rambling by kissing her. When he next looked into her eyes he smiled. She looked thoroughly bemused again.\\n\\n This one could get to his heart, he suddenly realized. The sound of the boatswain\u0027s whistle announcing the change of the watch was like a warning bell going off inside Nathan\u0027s mind. It was dangerous to be so attracted to his wife, foolish… irresponsible. To care for the woman would make him vulnerable, he knew. If he\u0027d learned anything of consequence in his escapades, it was to protect himself at all costs.\\n\\n Loving her could destroy him.\\n\\n \"Nathan, why are you frowning?\"\\n\\n He didn\u0027t answer her. He got out of bed, dressed with his back to her, and then walked out of the cabin. The door closed softly behind him.\\n\\n Sara was too stunned by his behavior to react for a long minute. Her husband had literally fled the cabin. It was as though he had a demon chasing him.\\n\\n Had their lovemaking meant so little to him that he couldn\u0027t wait to leave her? Sara burst into tears. She wanted, needed his words of love. God, he treated her as though she was nothing but a receptacle for his passion. Fast spent, fast forgotten. A whore was treated better than he\u0027d just treated her, she thought to herself. Women of the night at least earned a shilling or two.\\n\\n She hadn\u0027t even merited a growl of farewell.\\n\\n When her tears were spent she took her frustration out on the bed. She made a fist and slammed it into the center of Nathan\u0027s pillow, taking great satisfaction in pretending it was her husband\u0027s head. Then she pulled his pillow against her bosom and held it tight. Nathan\u0027s scent clung to the pillowcase. So did hers.\\n\\n It didn\u0027t take her long to realize how pitiful she was being. She tossed the pillow aside and turned her attention to righting the cabin.\\n\\n She stayed in the room the remainder of the afternoon. She dressed in the same blue dress, and when the cabin was cleaned she sat down in one of the chairs and began to make a sketch of the ship using her pad and charcoals.\\n\\n Sketching took her mind off Nathan. Matthew interrupted her when he knocked on the door to ask if she wanted to eat her dinner with the first or second change in the watch. She told him she would wait and share her meal with her aunt.\\n\\n Sara was eager to find out what the men thought about her soup. The aroma had been quite nice when she\u0027d finished stirring in all the spices. It should have a hearty flavor, she thought, for it had simmered long hours.\\n\\n It was only a matter of time before the men came to thank her. She brushed her hair and changed her gown in preparation for their visitations.\\n\\n Her staff would soon be completely loyal to her. Making the soup was a giant step in that direction, anyway. Why, by nightfall they would all think she was very, very worthy.\\n\\n Chapter Seven\\n\\n By nightfall they thought she was trying to kill them.\\n\\n The watch turned at six that evening. The first group filed into the galley to collect their dinner just a few minutes later. The men had put in a hard day\u0027s work. The decks had been scoured, the hammocks scrubbed, netting mended, and half the cannons had been given another thorough cleaning. The seamen were weary, and their hunger was fierce. Most ate two full bowls of the heavily flavored soup before they were appeased.\\n\\n They didn\u0027t start getting sick until the second watch had just eaten their share.\\n\\n Sara had no idea the men were ill. She was getting impatient, though, for no one had come along to tell her what a fine job she\u0027d done.\\n\\n When a hard knock sounded at her door she rushed to answer it. Jimbo stood at the entrance, frowning at her. Her smile faltered.\\n\\n \"Good evening, Jimbo,\" she began. \"Is something wrong? You look very unhappy.\"\\n\\n \"You haven\u0027t had any soup yet, have you, Lady Sara?\" he asked.\\n\\n His obvious concern didn\u0027t make any sense to her. She shook her head. \"I was waiting to share my dinner with Nora,\" she explained. \"Jimbo, what is that horrid sound I\u0027m hearing?\"\\n\\n She looked out the door to see if she could locate the sound.\\n\\n \"The men.\"\\n\\n \"The men?\"\\n\\n Nathan suddenly appeared at Jimbo\u0027s side. The look on her husband\u0027s face made her breath catch in the back of her throat. He looked bloody furious. Sara instinctively backed up. \"What\u0027s the matter, Nathan?\" she asked, her alarm obvious. \"Is something wrong? Is it Nora? Is she all right?\"\\n\\n \"Nora\u0027s fine,\" Jimbo interjected.\\n\\n Nathan motioned Jimbo out of the way, then stalked into the cabin. Sara continued to back away from him. She noticed his jaw was clenched tight. That was a bad sign.\\n\\n \"Are you upset about something?\" she asked Nathan in a faint whisper.\\n\\n He nodded.\\n\\n She decided to be more specific. \"Are you upset with me?\"\\n\\n He nodded again. Then he kicked the door shut.\\n\\n \"Why?\" she asked, trying desperately not to let him see her fear.\\n\\n \"The soup.\" Nathan\u0027s voice was low, controlled, furious.\\n\\n She was more confused by his answer than frightened. \"The men didn\u0027t care for my soup?\"\\n\\n \"It wasn\u0027t deliberate?\"\\n\\n Since she didn\u0027t have any idea what he meant by that question, she didn\u0027t answer. He could see the confusion in her eyes. He closed his own and counted to ten. \"Then you didn\u0027t deliberately try to kill them?\"\\n\\n She let out a loud gasp. \"Of course I didn\u0027t try to kill them. How could you think such a vile thing? The men are all part of my staff now, and I certainly wouldn\u0027t try to harm them. If they didn\u0027t like my soup, I\u0027m sorry. I had no idea they were such persnickety eaters.\"\\n\\n \"Persnickety eaters?\" He repeated those words in a roar. \"Twenty of my men are now hanging over the sides of my ship. They\u0027re retching up the soup you prepared for them. Another ten are writhing in agony in their hammocks. They\u0027re not dead yet, but they sure as hell are wishing they were.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-gift-crown-s-spies-3/page-18.html","bookId":1790,"book":{"id":1790,"title":"The Gift (Crown\u0027s Spies #3)","description":"Storyline: A child bride, Sara Winchester had grown into a winsome beauty, joyfully anticipating the day when her husband Nathan, Marquess of St. James, would return to claim her heart at last.
