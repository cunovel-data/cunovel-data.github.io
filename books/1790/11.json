Is that correct?\" \"Yes.\" \"Do you happen to know where Nathan is? I would like to have a word with him.\" \"He\u0027s aft.\" She looked startled but was quick to recover. Then she shook her head at him. The censure in her expression gained his full attention. He turned completely around. \"He\u0027s aft, I\u0027m telling you.\" \"Yes, he might very well be daft, Jimbo,\" she began. She paused to pick up her parasol and then walked around the big man. \"But you\u0027re most disloyal when you voice that thought aloud. I\u0027m Nathan\u0027s wife now, and I won\u0027t listen to such talk. Please don\u0027t show such disrespect again.\" Matthew came down the stairs just in time to hear his friend mutter something about respect. Lady Sara smiled as she made her way past him. \"What was that all about?\" Matthew asked his friend. \"I thought I heard you—\" Jimbo cut him off with a glare. \"You aren\u0027t going to believe this, but I just promised not ever to tell anyone Nathan was aft.\" Matthew shook his head. \"She\u0027s a strange one, isn\u0027t she, Jimbo? I\u0027m wondering how such an innocent could have come from such a mean-hearted family.\" \"Sara isn\u0027t anything like our Jade,\" Jimbo announced. He was referring to Nathan\u0027s younger sister. \"In all our travels together I never once saw Jade cry.\" \"No, she never cried.\" There was pride in Matthew\u0027s voice. \"But this one… I didn\u0027t know a woman could carry on the way she did that first night.\" \"Screaming like a hellion, too,\" Jimbo interjected. \"Now, Jade,\" he continued, \"she never screamed.\" \"Never,\" Matthew agreed. His voice was emphatic. Jimbo suddenly grinned. \"The two are as different as fire and snow,\" he said. \"Still, they do have one thing in common.\" \"What\u0027s that?\" \"They\u0027re both damn fair in looks.\" Matthew nodded. The comparison between the two ladies was cut short when a shrill scream reached them. They both knew it was Sara making all the racket. \"She\u0027s a piece of work, isn\u0027t she?\" Matthew drawled out. \"A damned loud piece of work,\" Jimbo muttered. \"Wonder what\u0027s got her all riled up this time.\" Odd, but both men were eager to get back up on deck to see what was happening. They were both smiling, too. Sara had just located Nathan. He was standing behind a spoked wheel. She was about to call out to him when he turned his back on her and pulled off his shirt. She saw the scars on his back. Her reaction was instinctive. She let out a shout of outrage. \"Who did that to you?\" Nathan immediately reacted. He grabbed hold of his whip and turned to confront the threat. It didn\u0027t take him any time at all to realize there wasn\u0027t any enemy trying to harm his bride. Sara stood all alone. \"What is it?\" he roared at her while he tried to calm his heartbeat. \"I thought someone was…\" He stopped himself in mid-bellow, took a deep breath, and then said, \"Are you in pain, madam?\" She shook her head. \"Don\u0027t you ever scream like that again,\" he ordered in a much softer tone of voice. \"If you wish my attention, simply ask for it.\" Sara\u0027s parasol fell to the deck when she walked over to her husband. She was still so stunned by what she\u0027d seen, she wasn\u0027t even aware she\u0027d dropped it. She stopped when she was just a scant foot away from Nathan. He saw the tears in her eyes. \"Now what is it?\" he demanded. \"Did someone frighten you?\" Damn, he didn\u0027t have the patience for this, he told himself. \"It\u0027s your back, Nathan,\" she whispered. \"It\u0027s covered with scars.\" He shook his head. No one had ever dared mention his disfigurement to him. Those who\u0027d seen his back pretended not to notice. \"Thank you for telling me,\" he snapped. \"I never would have known…\" Hell, she started to cry. His sarcasm was obviously too much for her, he decided. \"Look, Sara,\" he muttered in true exasperation. \"If the sight of my back offends you, go below.\" \"It doesn\u0027t offend me,\" she answered. \"Why would you say such a mean thing?\" Nathan motioned to Jimbo to take over the wheel, then clasped his hands behind his back so he wouldn\u0027t grab her. The urge to shake some sense into the woman fairly overwhelmed him. \"All right, then, why did you scream?\" His voice was as brisk as the wind. Sara guessed he was a little sensitive about his marks. \"I was very angry when I saw the scars, Nathan. Did you have an accident?\" \"No.\" \"Then someone deliberately did this thing to you?\" She didn\u0027t give him time to answer. \"What monster inflicted such pain? My God, how you must have suffered.\" \"For God\u0027s sake, it happened a long time ago.\" \"Was it Pagan?\" she asked. \"What?\" he asked. He looked startled. Sara thought her guess had been right after all. \"It was Pagan who did that to you, wasn\u0027t it?\" Jimbo started coughing. Nathan turned to glare him into silence. \"Why in God\u0027s name would you think it was Pagan?\" he asked Sara. \"Because he\u0027s mean enough,\" she answered. \"Oh?\" he asked. \"And how would you know that?\" She shrugged. \"I heard that he was.\" \"It wasn\u0027t Pagan.\" \"Are you absolutely certain, Nathan? No one knows what the villain looks like. Perhaps it was Pagan, and you just didn\u0027t realize it because he didn\u0027t give you his true name.\" He let her see his exasperation. \"I know who did it.\" \"Will you tell me who it was, then?\" \"Why?\" \"So I can hate him.\" His anger vanished. Such loyalty stunned him. \"No, I won\u0027t tell you who it was.\" \"But it wasn\u0027t Pagan.\" She could drive a man to drink, Nathan thought to himself. \"No,\" he answered once again. \"Nathan, you don\u0027t have to shout at me.\" He turned his back on her in dismissal. Jimbo moved away from the wheel. Sara waited until she and her husband were all alone and then moved closer. He felt the touch of her fingertips on the top of his right shoulder. He didn\u0027t move. The feathery light caress down his back was incredibly gentle, and provocative, too. He couldn\u0027t ignore it, or the strange feelings her touch evoked. \"I wouldn\u0027t have poked you in your back last night if I\u0027d known about your injury,\" she whispered. \"But I couldn\u0027t see in the dark, and I didn\u0027t… know.\" \"For God\u0027s sake, woman, it doesn\u0027t hurt now. It happened years ago.\" His abrupt tone startled her. Her hand dropped back to her side. She moved over to stand beside him. Her arm touched his. She looked up at his face and simply waited for him to look at her again. His expression could have been chiseled in stone, she thought to herself. He looked just the way she pictured a Viking. The ripple of muscles cording his shoulders and his upper arms were those of a fit warrior. His chest was covered with dark curly hair that tapered to a V at the waistband of his breeches. She didn\u0027t dare look any lower, for to do so would be brazen, and when she returned her attention to his face again she found him watching her. She blushed. \"Nathan?\" \"What?\" Did he always have to sound so resigned when he talked to her? Sara forced herself to sound pleasant when she apologized. \"I\u0027m sorry if I hurt your feelings.\" He didn\u0027t think that comment was worthy of a response. \"Will the captain mind?\" she asked then. \"Mind what?\" \"Mind that you\u0027re directing his boat for him.\" His smile was heartwarming to her. \"It isn\u0027t a boat, Sara. You may call the Seahawk a ship or a vessel, but you must never call her a boat. It\u0027s an insult, bride, and we captains take grave exception to hearing such blasphemy.\" \"We captains?\" He nodded. \"Oh, Nathan, I didn\u0027t realize,\" she blurted. \"Then we\u0027re rich?\" \"No.\" \"Well, why not?\" Hell, he thought, she looked disgruntled. Nathan quickly told her how he and his friend Colin had started the shipping company together, why they\u0027d decided that he should remain a silent partner, and he ended his brief summary with the fact that in approximately ten months time, give or take a month or two, their company would take a turn into sure profits. \"How can you be so certain that in just a year we\u0027ll be rich?\" \"The contract I signed.\" \"Do you mean a contract for shipping services?\" \"No.\" Her sigh was dramatic. \"Please explain, Nathan.\" He ignored her request. She nudged him. Lord, getting anything out of him was such a strain. \"If you\u0027re so certain about this, I\u0027ll be happy to help you.\" He actually laughed. Sara took heart. Her offer to lend a hand had obviously pleased him. Her voice was filled with enthusiasm when she said, \"I could help you with the books. I\u0027m really quite good with figures. No?\" she added when he shook his head. \"But I want to help.\" He let go of the wheel and turned to face her. Lord, she was a fair sight today, he thought to himself as he watched her try to manage her wild curls. The wind was high, making the task impossible. She was dressed in pink. Her cheeks were flushed, adding to the lovely picture. His gaze settled on her mouth. Her lips were just as rosy as the rest of her. He gave in to his sudden urge. Before she could back away from him he grabbed hold of her shoulders. He pulled her up against his chest, then threaded one hand through the curls behind her neck. Her hair felt like silk to him. He made a fist of the curls, then jerked her head back so her face was tilted up toward him. He told himself that it was only for his own peace of mind that he was going to kiss her, knowing full well that once he explained the special task she was going to have to undertake she\u0027d start screaming again. \"We\u0027ll each have a special duty to perform,\" he told her. His mouth was getting closer to hers. \"It\u0027s my duty to get you pregnant, Sara, and it will be your duty to give me a son.\" His mouth settled on top of hers just in time to capture her outraged gasp. Sara was simply too stunned to react at first. His mouth was hard, hot, incredibly demanding. He was drowning her with his warmth, his taste, his wonderful masculine scent. Nathan wanted her response. She didn\u0027t disappoint him. When his tongue moved inside her mouth to mate with hers, her knees went weak. She put her arms around his neck and clung to him even as she tried to wiggle out of his embrace. She didn\u0027t realize she was kissing him back, didn\u0027t know the sounds she heard belonged to her. Only when Nathan had her full cooperation did he gentle the kiss. God, she was soft. He could feel the heat inside her, wanted to get closer, closer. His hands moved to cup her derriere, and he slowly lifted her off the ground until her pelvis was touching his own, then pulled her tight against his arousal. His mouth slanted over hers again and again. He wanted to be inside her. Nathan knew he was close to losing all sense of discipline. His hunger was demanding to be appeased. The whistles and hoots of laughter penetrated his mind then. His crew was obviously enjoying the spectacle he was giving them. Nathan tried to pull away from Sara. She wouldn\u0027t let go of him. She pulled on his hair to get him to deepen the kiss again. He gave into her silent plea with a low growl. The kiss they shared was openly carnal, but when her sweet tongue rubbed against his he forced himself to stop. They were both out of breath when they drew apart. Sara couldn\u0027t seem to keep her balance. She fell back against the wooden ledge adjacent to the wheel. One hand rested on the swell of her bosom, and she let out a ragged little whisper. \"Oh, my.\" As soon as their captain had quit touching his bride the men returned to their duties. Nathan glared at several backs before he looked at Sara again. He couldn\u0027t help but feel extremely satisfied when he saw the bemused look on her face. It made him want to kiss her again. He had to shake his head over his own lack of discipline. He decided he\u0027d wasted enough time on his bride and turned his attention back to the wheel. He scowled when he noticed his hands were shaking. The kiss had obviously affected him a little more than he\u0027d thought. It took Sara much longer to recover. She was trembling from head to foot. She had no idea a kiss could be so… thorough. He certainly hadn\u0027t been affected, she thought when she saw the horridly bored look on his face again. She suddenly felt like crying and didn\u0027t understand why. Then she remembered the obscene remarks he\u0027d made about her special duty. \"I\u0027m not a brood mare,\" she whispered. \"And I\u0027m not at all certain I like you touching me.\" Nathan glanced back over his shoulder. \"You could have fooled me,\" he drawled. \"The way you kissed me—\" \"I believe I hated it.\" \"Liar.\" It was an insult, yes, but the way he\u0027d said the word actually warmed her heart. He made it sound very like an endearment. That didn\u0027t make any sense. Was she so desperate for a word of kindness from the Viking that she now responded to insults? Sara could feel herself blushing. She stared at her shoes and folded her hands demurely in front of her. \"You can\u0027t kiss me again,\" she announced, wishing her voice had sounded a little more forceful and less breathless. \"I can\u0027t?\" His amusement was apparent. \"No, you can\u0027t,\" she told him. \"I\u0027ve decided that you\u0027re going to have to court me first, Nathan, and then we must have a proper ceremony performed by a true minister before you may kiss me again.\" She hadn\u0027t looked at him when she made that emphatic speech, but when she was finished she glanced up to gauge his reaction. His expression, unfortunately, didn\u0027t tell her anything. She frowned at him. \"I believe our marriage could be challenged in the courts unless we say our vows to each other in front of a man of God.\" He finally let her see his reaction. She wished she\u0027d been left guessing. Lord, his scowl was as hot as the noon sun beating down on them. But his eyes… the color was so vivid, so true, so mesmerizing. When he was looking directly into her eyes he made her forget to breathe. A sudden thought settled in her mind. Her Viking was actually very handsome.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-gift-crown-s-spies-3/page-11.html","bookId":1790,"book":{"id":1790,"title":"The Gift (Crown\u0027s Spies #3)","description":"Storyline: A child bride, Sara Winchester had grown into a winsome beauty, joyfully anticipating the day when her husband Nathan, Marquess of St. James, would return to claim her heart at last.
