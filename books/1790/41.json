{"id":78572,"no":41,"title":"Page 41","content":"Nathan turned his attention to the door when the prince regent walked inside the office. Sara immediately moved away from her husband, bowed her head as any loyal subject should, and patiently waited for her leader to address her.\\n\\n The prince was of medium height and had dark, handsome looks. He wore his arrogance like a cloak around his shoulders.\\n\\n Each man bowed to the prince when he was greeted, and then it was Sara\u0027s turn. She made a low curtsy. \"It\u0027s always a pleasure to see you, Lady Sara.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you, my lord,\" she replied. \"And thank you, too, for granting me this audience.\"\\n\\n The prince looked bewildered by that comment. He nodded, however, and took his place behind Sir Richards\u0027s desk. The two men accompanying him took up their positions as sentinels behind their leader.\\n\\n Caine was concerned that Sara might make another comment about the letter she\u0027d written to the prince. He strolled over to stand next to her. \"Sara, I never sent your note to the prince. It\u0027s still in my pocket.\"\\n\\n Sir Richards was discussing the meeting with the prince, and since neither man was paying them any attention Sara felt it wasn\u0027t overly rude to whisper back. \"Why didn\u0027t you send the letter? Did you forget?\"\\n\\n \"No, I didn\u0027t forget,\" Caine said. \"The letter would have interfered with Nathan\u0027s plans.\"\\n\\n \"Then it was Nathan who requested this meeting?\"\\n\\n Caine nodded. \"Sir Richards also put in his request,\" he said. \"You\u0027d better sit down, Sara. It\u0027s going to get a little rocky. Keep your fingers crossed.\"\\n\\n Nathan was leaning against the wall, watching her. He heard Caine\u0027s suggestion that she sit down and waited to see what Sara would do. There was a wingback chair across the room and an empty window seat next to him.\\n\\n Sara glanced over to the wingback chair, then turned and walked over to Nathan. He was arrogantly satisfied with her instinctive show of loyalty.\\n\\n And then he realized he\u0027d come to depend upon that quality.\\n\\n Nathan sat and pulled her down beside him in the space of a second. He almost leaned down then and there to tell her how much he loved her. He stopped himself just in time. It had to be right, he told himself. In just a few more minutes he would show her how much he loved her.\\n\\n Sara edged away from her husband so that she wouldn\u0027t be touching him. She didn\u0027t think it would be appropriate to sit so close in the presence of the prince.\\n\\n Nathan thought otherwise. He wasn\u0027t at all gentle when he hauled her back up against his side.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m ready to begin,\" the prince announced.\\n\\n Sir Richards motioned to the guard standing by the front entrance. The man opened the door, and Sara\u0027s father came rushing into the office.\\n\\n As soon as she saw her father she instinctively moved closer to her husband. Nathan put his arm around her waist and held her close.\\n\\n The earl of Winchester bowed to the prince, then frowned when he spotted the others.\\n\\n He was about to request that the office be cleared, for the matter to be discussed was a confidential one, but the prince spoke first. \"Do sit down, Winston. I\u0027m eager to get this matter settled.\"\\n\\n The earl immediately took one of the chairs facing the prince. He sat down and leaned forward at the same time. \"Have you looked over the evidence I sent to you?\"\\n\\n \"I have,\" the prince answered. \"Winston, have you met our esteemed director of War Operations?\"\\n\\n Winston turned to Sir Richards and gave a quick nod. \"We met a time or two,\" he said. \"May I ask why he\u0027s here? I don\u0027t see that the matter has any bearing on his department. It\u0027s a question of breaking a contract, nothing more.\"\\n\\n \"On the contrary,\" Sir Richards interjected. His voice was as pleasant, as smooth as sugared ice. \"Both the prince and I are very interested in just how you came by this information about the earl of Wakersfieid. Would you care to enlighten us?\"\\n\\n \"I must protect the person who told me,\" Winston announced. He\u0027d turned to look at Sara when he\u0027d made that statement. His gaze deliberately lingered there a minute. Then he turned back to the prince. \"How isn\u0027t important, my lord. Surely, after reading the facts, you\u0027ve come to realize that my daughter can\u0027t live her life with the son of a traitor. She\u0027d be shunned by society. The marquess\u0027s father didn\u0027t act in good faith toward the king or the Winchesters when he signed the contract binding his son to my daughter. I therefore demand that Sara be freed from this ludicrous commitment and that the gift be given over to her as payment for the embarrassment and humiliation she\u0027s had to suffer.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m afraid I\u0027m really going to have to insist that you tell us who gave you the information about Nathan\u0027s father,\" Sir Richards said again.\\n\\n Winston turned to the prince for support. \"I would rather not answer that demand.\"\\n\\n \"I believe you must answer,\" the prince said.\\n\\n Winston\u0027s shoulders sagged. \"My daughter,\" he blurted out. \"Sara wrote to us. She gave us the information.\"\\n\\n Sara didn\u0027t say a word. Nathan gave her a gentle squeeze. It was an awkward attempt to give her comfort. She didn\u0027t protest at all.\\n\\n Don\u0027t give up on him, she thought. Those were his very words. Sara tried to concentrate on the important discussion underway, but Nathan\u0027s whispered command kept getting in the way.\\n\\n Her father was giving one excuse after another as to why his daughter would share that damning information about Nathan\u0027s father. Sara didn\u0027t want to listen to those lies.\\n\\n The prince caught her attention when he motioned to one of the men standing behind him. The guard immediately went over to the side entrance and pulled the door open. A short, thin man holding a dark cap in his hands came into the office.\\n\\n Sara didn\u0027t recognize the man. It was obvious, though, that her father did. He couldn\u0027t quite hide his surprise. \"Who is this man intruding upon our discussion?\" he asked.\\n\\n His paltry attempt to bluster his way through the ordeal didn\u0027t work. \"He\u0027s Luther Grant,\" Sir Richards drawled. \"Perhaps you\u0027ve met him, Winchester. Luther used to work as a senior attendant in our department. He was so trustworthy, he was given charge of the vault. It was his sole duty to keep England\u0027s secrets safe.\"\\n\\n The director\u0027s tone of voice had turned biting. \"Luther\u0027s going to be protecting the walls of Newgate Prison from now on. He\u0027ll have his very own cell to watch over.\"\\n\\n \"The game\u0027s over,\" Caine interjected. \"Grant told us you paid him to look at Nathan\u0027s file. When he couldn\u0027t find anything damning there, he looked at Nathan\u0027s father\u0027s file.\"\\n\\n Winston\u0027s expression showed only disdain. \"Who cares how the information was found out?\" he muttered. \"The only thing that matters is thatâ€”\"\\n\\n \"Oh, but we do care,\" Sir Richards interrupted. \"You\u0027ve committed an act of treason.\"\\n\\n \"Isn\u0027t that a hanging crime?\" the prince asked.\\n\\n From his expression Sara couldn\u0027t tell if he was goading her father or if he really didn\u0027t know.\\n\\n \"Yes, it is a hanging crime,\" Sir Richards said.\\n\\n Winston shook with fury. \"I have never been disloyal to the crown,\" he announced. He stared at the prince regent. \"When every other politician in this city has ridiculed you, I\u0027ve stood firmly by your side. My God, I even argued in your defense when you wanted to rid yourself of your wife. Is this how I\u0027m repaid for my loyalty?\"\\n\\n The prince\u0027s face turned red. It was obvious that he didn\u0027t like being reminded of his unpopularity or of his attempt to rid himself of his wife. He glared at Winston even as he shook his head. \"How dare you speak to your prince regent with such insolence?\"\\n\\n Winston realized he\u0027d gone too far. \"I apologize, my lord,\" he blurted out, \"but I am desperately trying to protect my daughter. The marquess of St. James isn\u0027t good enough for her.\"\\n\\n The prince took a deep breath. His color remained high, but his voice was much calmer when he said, \"I disagree with you. I\u0027ve never taken an active interest in the War Department, for it bores me immensely, but once I read the facts about Nathan\u0027s father I asked Sir Richards to give me the son\u0027s file as well. Nathan isn\u0027t responsible for his father\u0027s sins. No man should have to be.\" His voice rose an octave when he added, \"My subjects could blame me for my own father\u0027s weak condition if that was the case, isn\u0027t that so?\"\\n\\n \"They don\u0027t hold you responsible for your father\u0027s illness,\" Winston assured him.\\n\\n The prince nodded. \"Exactly so,\" he muttered. \"And I don\u0027t hold Nathan responsible for his father\u0027s errors. No, the marquess isn\u0027t responsible,\" he repeated in a weary voice. \"But even if he were, he more than proved his loyalty by all the courageous deeds he accomplished on England\u0027s behalf. If the secrets could all be revealed, Nathan would be knighted for his heroic acts. As to that, I\u0027m told that the earl of Cainewood would deserve like treatment. Reading the files took up most of my evening, Winston, and I now say that having all the facts before me, I feel honored to be in the same room with these loyal, distinguished men.\"\\n\\n No one said a word for a minute. Nathan could feel Sara trembling. He noticed that she was watching her father, and he wanted to whisper to her that it was all going to be all right, that he\u0027d never be able to frighten her again.\\n\\n The prince spoke once more. \"Sir Richards refuses to allow the information to be made public, however, and I have decided to bow to his superior wisdom in this matter. Suffice it to say that these men have my gratitude. I now have a bargain to put to you,\" he said. His gaze had turned to rest on the director. \"If Winston assures us that he won\u0027t speak a word about Nathan\u0027s father, I suggest we don\u0027t lock him up.\"\\n\\n Sir Richards pretended to mull over that suggestion. \"I would rather see him hanged. However, the decision is up to you. I am but your humble servant.\"\\n\\n The prince nodded. He looked at Winston again. \"I know that certain members of your household are aware of the information about Nathan\u0027s father. It will be your duty to keep them silent. You\u0027ll be responsible for defending Nathan against any such scandal, for if a hint of a rumor reaches me, you\u0027ll be charged with treason. Do I make myself clear?\"\\n\\n Winston nodded. He was so furious he could barely speak. The prince\u0027s revulsion was apparent. The earl of Winchester knew he wouldn\u0027t be included in any of the more important functions in future. As soon as the prince gave him the cut direct everyone else would follow suit.\\n\\n Sara could feel her father\u0027s rage. Her throat closed up, and she thought she was going to be sick. \"May I have a glass of water, please?\" she whispered to Nathan.\\n\\n He immediately got up and left the room to fetch a drink for her. Caine also moved from his chair and took Luther Grant out the side door.\\n\\n Winston turned to Sir Richards. \"I could challenge this. It\u0027s still Grant\u0027s word against mine.\"\\n\\n The director shook his head. \"We have other evidence,\" he lied.\\n\\n The earl of Winchester stood up. He obviously believed the director\u0027s bluff. \"I see,\" he muttered. \"How did you find out about Luther?\" he asked the prince.\\n\\n \"Your wife told us,\" the prince answered. \"She came to her daughter\u0027s aid, Winston, while you tried to destroy her. Leave, Winston. It pains me to look at you.\"\\n\\n The earl of Winchester bowed to the prince, turned to stare at his daughter for the briefest of seconds, and then left the office.\\n\\n Sara had never seen such black fury on her father\u0027s face. She was filled with terror. She knew her mother would soon bear the brunt of his anger.\\n\\n Dear God, she thought, she had to get to her first.\\n\\n \"Will you please excuse me?\" she cried out as she rushed toward the door.\\n\\n Sara had barely received the prince\u0027s nod before she\u0027d closed the front door behind her.\\n\\n \"Do you think she\u0027s ill?\" Sir Richards asked.\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t imagine why she wouldn\u0027t be,\" the prince answered. \"Richards,\" he added in a softer tone of voice, \"I know how the various department heads whisper their contempt for me. Oh, I have my spies to keep me informed. I also know you\u0027ve never said a word against me. Although I\u0027ve incorrectly been judged as a ruler who changes his mind whenever the whim comes over me, I tell you now that it isn\u0027t so. I won\u0027t change my mind about this issue with Winston, I assure you.\"\\n\\n Sir Richards walked to the door with the prince. \"You do realize, my lord, that I lied when I told Winston we had other evidence against him. It really is Grant\u0027s word against his, and if he were to push this issueâ€¦\"\\n\\n The prince smiled. \"He won\u0027t push anything,\" he assured the director.\\n\\n Nathan walked in by way of the side entrance with a glass of water in his hand and Caine by his side. The prince had just taken his leave. \"Where\u0027s Sara?\" Nathan asked.\\n\\n \"She went to the washroom,\" Sir Richards explained. He went back to his desk and collapsed in the chair. \"By God, that went smoothly. I couldn\u0027t be certain how the prince regent would behave. He was on the mark this time, wasn\u0027t he?\"\\n\\n \"Will he stay on the mark?\" Caine asked. \"Or will Winston be back in his camp come tomorrow?\"\\n\\n The director shrugged. \"I pray that he won\u0027t change his mind, and my feeling is that he\u0027ll keep his promise.\"\\n\\n Caine leaned on the edge of the desk. \"I cannot believe you let him read the files, Richards.\"\\n\\n \"Then don\u0027t believe it,\" his director answered, grinning. \"I gave him only a brief summary of some of the lesser deeds accomplished. Quit your frown, Caine. Nathan, for God\u0027s sake, quit pacing with that glass in your hand. Most of the water\u0027s on the carpet now.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s taking Sara so long?\"\\n\\n \"I believe she wasn\u0027t feeling well. Let her have a few more minutes of privacy.\"\\n\\n Nathan let out a sigh. He went to refill the glass while Sir Richards caught Caine up on activities within the department.\\n\\n Nathan tried to be patient, but when another ten minutes went by and Sara still hadn\u0027t returned to the office he decided to go after her. \"Where the hell is the washroom? Sara might need me.\"\\n\\n Sir Richards gave him directions to the floor above. \"Are the papers ready for signatures?\" Caine asked when Nathan turned to leave.\\n\\n \"They\u0027re on the desk,\" Nathan called over his shoulder. \"As soon as I get my hands on Sara we can get this over and done with.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s quite a romantic,\" Caine drawled out.\\n\\n \"Actually, what he\u0027s about to do for his wife indicates to me that he really is a romantic at heart. Who would have thought Nathan would fall in love?\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-gift-crown-s-spies-3/page-41.html","bookId":1790,"book":{"id":1790,"title":"The Gift (Crown\u0027s Spies #3)","description":"Storyline: A child bride, Sara Winchester had grown into a winsome beauty, joyfully anticipating the day when her husband Nathan, Marquess of St. James, would return to claim her heart at last.
