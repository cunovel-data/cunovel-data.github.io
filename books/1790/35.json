{"id":78566,"no":35,"title":"Page 35","content":"Sara\u0027s anguish was apparent, however. She looked devastated, defeated. Colin began to have doubts about his quick judgment. Was Sara capable of such fakery? \"Why don\u0027t you ask Nathan again?\" he suggested in a softer tone of voice.\\n\\n She shook her head. \"He should have enough faith in me to know I\u0027d never betray him.\"\\n\\n \"Get in the carriage,\" her father ordered again.\\n\\n She whirled back to confront her father. \"I\u0027ve been such a fool about so many things, Father,\" she announced. \"I actually made excuses for your sinful conduct, but Nora was right after all. You aren\u0027t any better than your brothers. You disgust me. You let your brother Henry dole out the punishment whenever you\u0027re displeased. Your hands stay clean that way, don\u0027t they? Oh, God, I never want to see you again.\" She took a deep breath, then added in a harsh whisper, \"I\u0027m no longer your daughter.\"\\n\\n She turned her attention to Belinda next. \"As for you, I hope you get down on your knees and pray God\u0027s forgiveness for all the lies you\u0027ve told today. You may tell Mother I\u0027m sorry she isn\u0027t feeling well. I\u0027ll come to see her when I\u0027m certain neither one of you is home.\"\\n\\n After making that speech Sara turned her back on her family and walked across the street. Colin tried to take hold of her arm. She pulled away.\\n\\n Everyone watched her until she\u0027d walked inside the office and shut the door behind her.\\n\\n The earl of Winchester still wasn\u0027t ready to give up. The argument became fierce again and lasted several minutes before Nathan finally took a step forward.\\n\\n Sara\u0027s father tried to go toward the office then. He shouted his daughter\u0027s name in such a booming voice that the veins in the side of his neck stood out. Nathan blocked his path. That action proved threatening enough.\\n\\n No one said a word until the Winchester carriage rounded the corner. The men on horseback trailed after the vehicle. Then everyone started talking at once.\\n\\n Jimbo and Matthew both argued in Sara\u0027s defense. \"She might have told,\" Matthew said, \"but only the way she told about Nora and me. Inadvertent like.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m saying she didn\u0027t tell at all,\" Jimbo muttered. He folded his arms across his chest and glared at Colin when he made that emphatic statement. \"You didn\u0027t help, Dolphin,\" he added. \"You could have swayed the boy\u0027s mind if you\u0027d argued in our Sara\u0027s defense.\"\\n\\n \"The last time I argued in a woman\u0027s defense Nathan damn near got killed,\" Colin replied.\\n\\n \"He was young and stupid back then,\" Matthew said.\\n\\n \"He still is,\" Jimbo stated. \"You aren\u0027t at all surprised, are you?\" he said then. \"With your cynical heart, I imagine you expected our Sara to fail you. Isn\u0027t that right?\"\\n\\n Nathan wasn\u0027t listening to his friends. His gaze was centered on the corner where the carriage had last been seen. With a shake of his head he pulled himself out of his musings and turned to walk away.\\n\\n \"Where are you going?\" Matthew called out.\\n\\n \"Maybe he came to his senses,\" Jimbo said when Nathan started across the street. \"He might be going to apologize to Sara. Did you see the look on her face, Matthew? It tore me up to see such torment.\"\\n\\n \"Nathan wouldn\u0027t apologize,\" Colin said. \"He doesn\u0027t know how. But he might be calm enough to listen to her now.\"\\n\\n Sara had no idea Jimbo and Matthew had come to her defense. She believed everyone had damned her. She was so upset she couldn\u0027t stop pacing. She kept picturing the expression on Nathan\u0027s face when she\u0027d admitted that she\u0027d known the truth about his father.\\n\\n He believed she had betrayed him.\\n\\n Sara had never felt so alone. She didn\u0027t know where to go, whom to turn to, what to do. She couldn\u0027t think. Her fantasy of living in paradise with the man she\u0027d always believed loved her was gone.\\n\\n Nathan had never loved her. It was just as her relatives had told her. He was only after the king\u0027s gift. She\u0027d thought those often-repeated reminders were lies meant to turn her heart against him. She knew better now.\\n\\n God, what a fool she\u0027d been.\\n\\n The pain was simply too much, too overwhelming to think about. Sara remembered the vile threat her father had made against Nathan\u0027s sister Jade. Her heart went out to the sister, and even though she\u0027d never met the woman she knew it was her duty to try to warn her so she could prepare herself.\\n\\n The plan gave her a mission, a reason to move. No one noticed when she walked outside. They were occupied shouting at each other. She walked to the corner, but as soon as she was out of sight she started running. She lost her way almost immediately, yet she kept on running until she was out of breath.\\n\\n God took mercy on her, for when she couldn\u0027t go another step she spotted a hack in the middle of the street only half a block away. A passenger was getting out of the vehicle. While he sorted through his pockets for his coins Sara hurried forward.\\n\\n She didn\u0027t have any shillings with her. She didn\u0027t know the address of her destination either. She couldn\u0027t worry about the lack of funds, though. She decided the coachman would have to be responsible for finding the address on his own.\\n\\n \"The earl of Cainewood\u0027s townhouse, if you please,\" she called out. She got inside the vehicle and pressed herself into the comer. Her fear was that Nathan might have sent one of his men to chase after her.\\n\\n The coachman directed the hack to what he referred to as the fancy-pants section of town, yet he still had to ask directions from a passerby before he found the address his fare had requested.\\n\\n Sara used the time to calm her queasy stomach. She took deep, gulping breaths and prayed she wouldn\u0027t be sick.\\n\\n Nathan had no idea Sara wasn\u0027t waiting for him inside the office. He tried to rid himself of some of his anger before he spoke to her again. He didn\u0027t want to add to her upset. God help him, he couldn\u0027t imagine what her life must have been like living with such vile relatives.\\n\\n Jimbo began to nag him in earnest. \"I don\u0027t condemn her for telling,\" Nathan said. \"I understand her flaws. I wasn\u0027t surprised. Now, if you\u0027ll quit your hounding, I\u0027ll go and tell her I\u0027ve forgiven her. Will that satisfy you?\"\\n\\n Jimbo nodded. Nathan strode across the street and went inside the office. It didn\u0027t take him any time at all to realize his wife wasn\u0027t there. He looked inside the back storage area just to make certain.\\n\\n Panic filled him. He knew she hadn\u0027t left with her father, and that meant that she had literally walked away.\\n\\n The picture of just what could happen to an unattended woman in that section of the city terrified Nathan. His roar echoed through the streets. He had to find her.\\n\\n She needed him.\\n\\n Chapter Thirteen\\n\\n Sara cried her way to her destination. When the hack came to a stop in front of a brick-front townhouse she forced herself to gain a little control. Her voice barely cracked when she ordered the coachman to wait for her. \"I won\u0027t be but a minute,\" she promised. \"I have another destination after I\u0027ve finished here, and I\u0027ll double your fare if you\u0027ll kindly be patient.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll wait as long as it takes,\" the driver promised with a tip of his hat.\\n\\n Sara rushed up the steps and knocked on the door. She wanted to get inside the townhouse before she was spotted by her relatives. She was also afraid her courage would desert her before she\u0027d completed her mission.\\n\\n The door was opened by a tall, arrogant-looking man with deep wrinkles at the corners of his eyes. He was quite homely in appearance, but the sparkle in his dark eyes indicated he had a kind nature.\\n\\n \"May I be of assistance, madam?\" the butler inquired in a haughty tone of voice.\\n\\n \"I must see Lady Jade at once, sir,\" Sara answered. She gave a quick look over her shoulder to make certain she wasn\u0027t being watched, then said, \"Do let me in.\"\\n\\n The butler only had enough time to get out of her way. Sara rushed past him, then demanded in a whisper that he shut the door and bolt it against intruders.\\n\\n \"I pray your mistress is here,\" she said. \"I don\u0027t know what I will do if she isn\u0027t home.\"\\n\\n That possibility was so distressing, her eyes filled with tears. \"Lady Jade is home today,\" the butler told her.\\n\\n \"Thank God for that.\"\\n\\n A smile softened the elderly man\u0027s expression. \"Yes, madam, I often thank God for sending her to me. Now,\" he continued in a brisker tone of voice, \"may I tell my mistress who has come calling?\"\\n\\n \"Lady Sara,\" she blurted out. She suddenly grabbed hold of his hand. \"And please hurry, sir. I\u0027m growing more cowardly by the second.\"\\n\\n The butler\u0027s curiosity was caught. The poor distressed woman was trying to squeeze the bones right out of his hand. \"I shall be pleased to hurry, Lady Sara,\" he announced. \"Just as soon as you let go of me.\"\\n\\n She hadn\u0027t realized she was holding on to him until that moment, and she immediately pulled away. \"I\u0027m very upset, sir. Please forgive my boldness.\"\\n\\n \"Of course, m\u0027lady,\" the butler returned. \"Is there perchance a last name to go with the first?\" he asked.\\n\\n The question proved to be too much for her. Much to the servant\u0027s consternation, she burst into tears. \"I used to be Lady Sara Winchester, but that changed, and I became Lady Sara St. James. Now that\u0027s going to change, too,\" she cried. \"Come morning, I don\u0027t know what my name will be. Harlot, I would imagine. Everyone will believe I lived in sin, but I didn\u0027t, sir. I didn\u0027t,\" she whispered. \"It wasn\u0027t sinful.\"\\n\\n She paused in her explanation to mop the tears away from her eyes with the handkerchief the butler handed her. \"Oh, you might as well call me harlot now and get it over with. I\u0027ll have to get used to it.\"\\n\\n Sara realized she was making a complete fool of herself. The butler was slowly backing away from her. He probably thought he\u0027d let a deranged woman into his employer\u0027s sanctuary.\\n\\n The earl of Cainewood had just strolled into the foyer from the back of the house where his library was situated when he heard his man Sterns ask their guest what her full name was. Her bizarre answer had made him stop in his tracks.\\n\\n Sara tried to skirt her way around the butler. She handed him the soggy handkerchief and said, \"I shouldn\u0027t have come here. I realize that now. I\u0027ll send a note to your mistress. Lady Jade is certainly too busy to see me.\"\\n\\n \"Catch her, Sterns,\" the earl called out.\\n\\n \"As you wish,\" the butler replied. His hands settled on Sara\u0027s shoulders. \"Now what, m\u0027lord?\" he inquired.\\n\\n \"Turn her around.\"\\n\\n Sterns didn\u0027t have to force Sara. She moved without any prodding. \"Are you Lady Jade\u0027s husband?\" she asked when she saw the tall, handsome man leaning against the banister.\\n\\n \"May I present my employer, the earl of Cainewood?\" the butler announced in a formal voice.\\n\\n Her curtsy was instinctive, born from years of training. The butler made her stumble, though, when he added, \"M\u0027lord, may I present Lady Sara Harlot?\"\\n\\n She almost fell to her knees. Sterns reached out to steady her. \"It was just a jest, m\u0027lady. I couldn\u0027t restrain myself.\"\\n\\n Jade\u0027s husband came forward. He was smiling at her. That helped. \"You may call me Caine,\" he told her.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m Nathan\u0027s wife,\" she blurted out.\\n\\n His smile was so tender, so kind. \"I guessed as much,\" he said, \"as soon as I saw how upset you were. I also caught the part of your explanation about becoming a St. James,\" he added when she looked so bewildered. \"Welcome to our family, Sara.\"\\n\\n He took hold of her hand and gave it an affectionate squeeze. \"My wife is most eager to meet you. Sterns, go and fetch Jade, will you? Sara, come along with me into the drawing room. We can get to know each other while we wait for my wife.\"\\n\\n \"But sir, this isn\u0027t a social call,\" Sara said. \"When you learn the reason for my visit you\u0027ll both want to throw me out.\"\\n\\n \"Shame on you for thinking we\u0027d be so inhospitable,\" he countered. He winked at her, then pulled her along by his side. \"We\u0027re family now, Sara. Call me Caine, not sir.\"\\n\\n \"I won\u0027t be part of the family long,\" she whispered.\\n\\n \"Now, now, don\u0027t start crying again. It can\u0027t be as bad as all that. Have you come to tell on Nathan, then? What\u0027s he done, I wonder.\"\\n\\n His smile indicated he was teasing her. The mere mention of her husband started the tears again. \"He hasn\u0027t done anything,\" she said between sobs. \"Besides, I would never tell on my husband if he displeased me. It wouldn\u0027t be loyal.\"\\n\\n \"So loyalty is important to you?\" he asked.\\n\\n She nodded. Then she frowned. \"So is having faith in your spouse,\" she muttered. \"Some do, others don\u0027t.\"\\n\\n He wasn\u0027t certain he knew what she was talking about. \"Do you?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"Not anymore I don\u0027t,\" she announced. \"I\u0027ve learned my lesson.\"\\n\\n Caine still didn\u0027t know what the conversation was about. \"I haven\u0027t come here to talk about Nathan,\" she declared. \"Our marriage will soon be over. You might as well understand that right away.\"\\n\\n It took considerable effort for Caine to keep his smile contained. So it was a marital disagreement after all. \"Nathan can be a bit difficult,\" he said.\\n\\n \"That he can, husband.\"\\n\\n Both Caine and Sara turned toward the doorway just as Lady Jade came strolling into the room.\\n\\n Sara thought Nathan\u0027s sister was the most beautiful woman she\u0027d ever seen. She had such glorious auburn hair. Her eyes were as green as Nathan\u0027s, and her complexion was porcelain-perfect. Sara felt completely inadequate by comparison.\\n\\n She forced herself to put the matter of appearances aside and began to pray in earnest that Jade didn\u0027t share her brother\u0027s cranky disposition. \"I\u0027ve come with distressing news,\" she blurted out.\\n\\n \"We already know you\u0027re married to Nathan,\" Caine drawled. \"There can\u0027t be anything more distressing to you than that, Sara. You have our sympathy.\"\\n\\n \"How very disloyal of you,\" Jade replied. Her smile indicated she wasn\u0027t at all irritated by her husband\u0027s remark, however. \"Caine loves my brother,\" she told Sara. \"He just hates to admit it.\"\\n\\n She walked over and kissed Sara\u0027s cheek. \"You aren\u0027t at all what I expected,\" she said. \"That pleases me. Where are my manners? I\u0027m so pleased to finally meet you, Sara. Where is Nathan? Will he be joining you soon?\"\\n\\n Sara shook her head. She suddenly had to sit down. She collapsed into the nearest chair. \"I never want to see him again,\" she whispered. \"Except to tell him that I never want to see him again, of course. Oh, I don\u0027t know where to begin.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-gift-crown-s-spies-3/page-35.html","bookId":1790,"book":{"id":1790,"title":"The Gift (Crown\u0027s Spies #3)","description":"Storyline: A child bride, Sara Winchester had grown into a winsome beauty, joyfully anticipating the day when her husband Nathan, Marquess of St. James, would return to claim her heart at last.
