{"id":78565,"no":34,"title":"Page 34","content":"Sara, on the other hand, had been a rather plain, lanky-legged child. She was terribly awkward, and her permanent teeth had seemed to take forever to come in straight. For almost a year she spit whenever she spoke. No one except her nanny and her mother ever doted on her.\\n\\n It was a sin not to love her sister, and for that reason alone Sara loved Belinda. She thought she understood her sister\u0027s cruel streak. It had been born out of all the disappointments she\u0027d suffered, and Sara always tried to be patient and understanding with her. When Belinda wasn\u0027t in a snit about something she could actually be quite pleasant.\\n\\n Sara tried to concentrate on her sister\u0027s good qualities when she called out her greeting. Her grip on Nathan\u0027s arm was at great odds with her cheerful tone of voice. \"Belinda, how nice it is to see you again.\"\\n\\n Her sister rudely stared at Nathan while she returned her sister\u0027s greeting. \"I\u0027m happy you\u0027re finally home, Sara.\"\\n\\n \"Is Mother with you?\" Sara asked.\\n\\n The earl of Winchester answered her question. \"Your mother\u0027s at home, where she belongs. Get into the carriage, daughter. I don\u0027t want trouble, but I\u0027m prepared for it,\" he added. \"You\u0027re coming with us. No one knows you\u0027ve been with the marquess, and if we—\"\\n\\n \"Oh, Papa,\" Belinda interrupted, \"you know that isn\u0027t true. Everyone knows. Why, consider all the notes of sympathy we\u0027ve received since Sara left.\"\\n\\n \"Silence!\" the earl roared. \"Dare you contradict me?\"\\n\\n Sara moved so quickly Nathan didn\u0027t have time to stop her. She pulled Belinda away from her father\u0027s side and positioned herself between them. \"Belinda didn\u0027t mean to contradict you,\" Sara said.\\n\\n Her father looked somewhat mollified. \"I won\u0027t tolerate insolence,\" he muttered. \"As to the few who do know about your disgraceful conduct, daughter,\" he continued, address ing his frown and his full attention to Sara, \"they\u0027ll keep their mouths shut. If a scandal breaks before I\u0027ve settled this matter, I\u0027ll face it.\"\\n\\n Sara was more concerned than ever. When her father acted so sure of himself there was always mischief afoot. \"What scandal, Father?\" she asked. \"Nathan and I haven\u0027t done anything to cause gossip. We\u0027re obeying all the conditions set down in the contract.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t mention the contract to me, daughter. Now get into the carriage before I order my men to draw their weapons.\"\\n\\n The ache in Sara\u0027s stomach intensified. She was going to have to defy her father. It was a first for her. Oh, she\u0027d often stood up to him, but it was always in defense of her mother or her sister, never herself.\\n\\n She slowly backed away until she was once again standing next to Nathan. \"I\u0027m sorry to disappoint you, Father, but I cannot go with you. My place is with my husband.\"\\n\\n The earl was infuriated. To have his daughter openly defy him in front of witnesses was humiliating. He reached out to slap her. Nathan was quicker. He grabbed hold of the earl\u0027s wrist and started to squeeze. Hard. He wanted to break the bone in half.\\n\\n Sara stopped him by merely touching him. When she sagged against his side he immediately let go of her father and put his arm around her shoulder. He could feel her trembling and became all the more furious.\\n\\n \"She isn\u0027t going anywhere, old man,\" Nathan announced in a low, controlled voice.\\n\\n The denial was obviously the signal the earl\u0027s men needed. The pistols were drawn and pointed at Nathan.\\n\\n Sara let out a gasp. She couldn\u0027t believe what was happening. She tried to put herself in front of Nathan to protect him. He wouldn\u0027t let her move. He tightened his hold and continued to stare at her father. He smiled. Sara didn\u0027t know what to make of that reaction.\\n\\n Surely he understood the severity of the situation. \"Nathanial?\" she whispered. She used that name as a method to put him on his guard. She leaned up and then whispered, \"You don\u0027t have a pistol. They do. Please take notice of the odds, husband.\"\\n\\n Nathan quit his smile and looked down at her. He knew what she did not—that the odds were indeed on his side. At least eight of his loyal crew had come running at the sight of the carriage. They were lined up behind Sara, ready and armed for a fight.\\n\\n There was also the fact that her father was bluffing. The look in his eyes indicated to Nathan that he didn\u0027t have the mind or the courage for a direct confrontation.\\n\\n \"This has gotten completely out of hand,\" Sara told her father. She was so upset, her voice shook. \"Order your men to put their weapons away, Father. Nothing will be solved by hurting Nathan or me.\"\\n\\n The earl of Winchester didn\u0027t give the order quickly enough. \"I won\u0027t let you hurt my husband,\" Sara cried out. \"I love him.\"\\n\\n \"He won\u0027t hurt him,\" Colin called out. \"I\u0027ll put a hole through his forehead if he tries.\"\\n\\n Sara turned to look at Nathan\u0027s friend. The transformation in Colin was so stunning to her, she caught her breath. Colin\u0027s stance looked relaxed, and there was a smile on his face, but the coldness in his eyes clearly indicated he\u0027d carry out his threat without suffering a moment\u0027s qualm.\\n\\n The earl immediately motioned for his men to quit their positions. When their weapons were back inside their waistbands he tried a different approach to gain victory. \"Belinda, tell your sister about your mother. Since Sara refuses to come home, she might as well hear the truth now.\"\\n\\n Belinda had moved back to her father\u0027s side. He gave her arm a little prod to get her started. \"Sara, you really must come home with us,\" Belinda blurted. She glanced over at her father, received his nod, and then continued. \"Mother\u0027s taken gravely ill. That\u0027s the reason she didn\u0027t come with us.\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s longing to see you again,\" her father interjected. \"Though after the way you\u0027ve worried her, I can\u0027t understand why.\"\\n\\n Sara shook her head. \"Mother isn\u0027t ill,\" she said. \"This is just trickery to get me to leave Nathan, isn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n \"I would never use your mother in such a manner,\" her father muttered with indignation.\\n\\n He nudged Belinda again. Nathan noticed the action and knew the scene he was witnessing had been rehearsed. He hoped his wife was astute enough to notice, too.\\n\\n Belinda took a step forward. \"Mama took ill right after you left, Sara. Why, for all she knew, you could have been drowned at sea, or killed by… pirates.\"\\n\\n \"But Belinda, Mother…\" Sara stopped. She wasn\u0027t certain her father knew she\u0027d left a note explaining to her mother that she was going to help Nora get back home. Her mother might have hidden the letter from her father. \"I mean to say, I sent a long letter to Mama when Nathan and I reached our destination. Mama should have received the missive by now.\"\\n\\n Nathan was surprised by that news. \"When did you write?\"\\n\\n \"When you left to get supplies,\" Sara explained.\\n\\n \"Yes, we received both of your letters,\" the earl interjected.\\n\\n Sara was about to argue that she\u0027d only sent one letter, but she wasn\u0027t given a chance before her father continued. \"And of course, I was pleased with the information you gave me. Still, daughter, the matter is not quite resolved, and for that reason we must continue to use discretion.\"\\n\\n She didn\u0027t know what he was talking about. \"What information?\" she asked.\\n\\n Her father shook his head at her. \"Don\u0027t play the fool with me, Sara.\" He straightened his shoulders, then turned to pull the carriage door wide. \"Your mother is waiting.\"\\n\\n Sara looked up at Nathan. \"Will you take me to see Mother? I\u0027ll worry until I\u0027ve spoken to her.\"\\n\\n \"Later,\" Nathan replied.\\n\\n Sara turned back to her father. \"Please tell Mother we\u0027ll come to visit her as soon as Nathan finishes his business here.\"\\n\\n The earl of Winchester had planned to wait until he\u0027d gotten Sara away from the marquess before putting his plan into action. He didn\u0027t like direct conflicts. It was much more satisfying to have surprise on his side, and less dangerous as well. Yet when the marquess told him to take his leave, his rage exploded. \"The prince regent has all the information before him now,\" he shouted. \"It\u0027s only a matter of time till he decides you\u0027ve violated the contract. Just you wait and see.\"\\n\\n \"What the hell are you rambling about?\" Nathan demanded. \"You\u0027re demented if you think I\u0027ve violated any conditions. This marriage will not be invalidated. I\u0027ve slept with my wife. It\u0027s too late.\"\\n\\n The earl\u0027s face turned a blotchy red. Sara had never seen him in such a fury.\\n\\n \"Father, please calm yourself. You\u0027re going to make yourself ill.\"\\n\\n \"Sara, do you know what your father\u0027s talking about?\" Nathan asked.\\n\\n She shook her head. She and her husband both turned back to the earl again.\\n\\n \"This is a private conversation,\" Sara\u0027s father announced. He nodded to his men. \"Wait at the corner.\"\\n\\n He turned to Nathan again. \"Dismiss your men,\" he ordered, \"unless you wish for them to overhear what I\u0027m about to say.\"\\n\\n Nathan shrugged. \"They stay.\"\\n\\n \"Father, I\u0027ll be happy to explain,\" Belinda volunteered. She smiled while she waited for their escort to leave. When the men were out of earshot she turned to Nathan. \"Sara wrote to us. We never would have known if she hadn\u0027t told, you see.\"\\n\\n \"What wouldn\u0027t you have known?\" Sara asked.\\n\\n Belinda let out a mock sigh. \"Oh, Sara, don\u0027t act so innocent. It isn\u0027t necessary now.\" She looked up at Nathan again and smiled. \"She told us about your father. We know all about the earl of Wakersfield now. Yes, we do.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Sara cried out. \"Belinda, why—\"\\n\\n Her sister couldn\u0027t let her continue. \"Of course, Sara only gave us the bare bones, but once we had that information—well, Papa had his important friend do a little investigating, and the rest was ferreted out. When Papa\u0027s finished, everyone in London will know that your husband\u0027s father was a traitor.\"\\n\\n The earl let out a snort of disgust. \"Did you think you could keep that filth swept under the carpet?\" he asked Nathan. \"My God, your father nearly toppled our government. Machiavelli was a saint in comparison to your father. Those sins are now on your shoulders,\" he added with a brisk nod. \"When I\u0027m finished you\u0027ll be destroyed.\"\\n\\n \"Father, quit these threats,\" Sara cried out. \"You can\u0027t mean them.\"\\n\\n Her father ignored her plea. His gaze was directed on Nathan. \"Do you honestly believe the prince regent will force my daughter to spend her life tied to an infidel like you?\"\\n\\n Nathan was so astonished by the earl\u0027s comments that a fury he\u0027d never felt before began to burn inside him. How had the bastard found out about his father? And God, when it was made public, how would his sister Jade react?\\n\\n It was as if the earl had read Nathan\u0027s mind. \"Think about your sister,\" he announced. \"Lady Jade\u0027s married to the earl of Cainewood, isn\u0027t she? She and her husband have become the darlings of the set. That will soon change,\" he added with another snort. \"The shame is going to make your sister a leper in society, I promise you.\"\\n\\n Sara was terrified on Nathan\u0027s behalf. How had her father found out about the earl of Wakersfield? When Nora had confided that secret to her she\u0027d told her no one would ever find out. The father\u0027s file was locked away inside the War Department\u0027s vault. No one could breach that sanctuary.\\n\\n And then the full truth of what her father and her sister were trying to do settled in her mind. They wanted Nathan to believe she\u0027d betrayed him.\\n\\n She immediately shook her head. No, that didn\u0027t make sense, she told herself. How could they guess that she\u0027d found out? \"I don\u0027t understand how you learned about Nathan\u0027s father,\" she whispered. \"But I—\"\\n\\n Belinda interrupted her. \"You told us. You don\u0027t have to lie any longer. As soon as Papa read the shocking news he did as you instructed, Sara. For heaven\u0027s sake, you should be happy now. You\u0027re going to be free very soon. Then you can marry a gentleman worthy of you. Isn\u0027t that what you said, Papa?\"\\n\\n The earl of Winchester quickly nodded. \"If the contract is set aside, the duke of Loughtonshire would still be willing to take you for his wife.\"\\n\\n \"But Belinda\u0027s pledged to him,\" Sara whispered.\\n\\n \"He prefers you,\" her father muttered.\\n\\n The pain in Sara\u0027s stomach was so acute it almost doubled her over. \"Is that why you\u0027re lying, Belinda? You don\u0027t want to marry the duke, and you\u0027ve made a pact with Father, haven\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not lying,\" Belinda countered. \"You gave us the information we needed. Papa says he\u0027s going to demand that all the land the marquess inherited from his father be confiscated. When Papa\u0027s finished,\" she added with a sarcastic slur in her voice, \"the marquess will be a pauper.\"\\n\\n Sara shook her head. Tears streamed down her cheeks. She was so humiliated that her family would act in such a cruel, sadistic manner. \"Oh, Belinda, please don\u0027t do this.\"\\n\\n Nathan hadn\u0027t said a word. When his arm dropped away from Sara\u0027s shoulders the earl guessed that his gamble had paid off. He felt like gloating with victory. He\u0027d heard what a cynical, hardheaded man the marquess of St. James was, and now he knew the rumors were true.\\n\\n Sara needed to hear her husband tell her he believed her. She couldn\u0027t tell anything from his expression. \"Nathan? Do you believe I wrote to my mother and told her about your father\u0027s sins?\"\\n\\n He answered her with a question of his own. \"Did you know about my father?\"\\n\\n God save her, she almost lied to him. He looked so bored, so unconcerned. Yet his voice shook with anger.\\n\\n He condemned her.\\n\\n \"Yes, I did know about your father,\" she admitted. \"Nora told me.\"\\n\\n He took a step away from her. She felt as though he\u0027d just struck her. \"Nathan? You cannot believe I would betray you. You cannot!\"\\n\\n Colin spoke up. \"Why shouldn\u0027t he? It\u0027s damn telling evidence against you. That secret\u0027s been safe a long time. Then you find out, and—\"\\n\\n \"So you find me guilty, Colin?\" she interrupted.\\n\\n He shrugged. \"I don\u0027t know you well enough to judge if I can trust you or not,\" he said. He was being brutally honest with her. \"But you are a Winchester,\" he added with a meaningful glance in her father\u0027s direction.\\n\\n Colin looked at Nathan. He knew the anguish his friend must be going through yet doubted that anyone else was aware of that pain. Nathan had that uncaring look on his face. His friend had become a master at concealing his reactions. Ironically, it had been a woman who had first taught him how to protect his heart. Now another woman seemed to be proving Nathan\u0027s cynicism was more than justified. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-gift-crown-s-spies-3/page-34.html","bookId":1790,"book":{"id":1790,"title":"The Gift (Crown\u0027s Spies #3)","description":"Storyline: A child bride, Sara Winchester had grown into a winsome beauty, joyfully anticipating the day when her husband Nathan, Marquess of St. James, would return to claim her heart at last.
