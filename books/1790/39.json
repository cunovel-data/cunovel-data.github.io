You\u0027ve stomped on her flower.\"\\n\\n \"Her heart, damn it,\" Nathan muttered. \"Get it right, for God\u0027s sake.\"\\n\\n Since Nathan wasn\u0027t looking at him, Caine felt it was safe to smile. \"So what are you going to do?\" he asked.\\n\\n Another five minutes passed in silence. Then Nathan straightened his shoulders. He turned around to look at Caine. \"I\u0027m going to restore her faith in me.\"\\n\\n Caine didn\u0027t think it would do him any good to remind Nathan that he\u0027d suggested that very action not ten minutes earlier.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s a sound idea,\" he said instead. \"Now tell me how you plan to achieve this—\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to show her,\" Nathan interrupted. \"Hell, why didn\u0027t I think of this before?\"\\n\\n \"Since I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re thinking, I can\u0027t answer you.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s so simple, an imbecile could figure it out. I\u0027ll need your help to pull it off.\"\\n\\n \"I already said I\u0027d help you.\"\\n\\n \"Now I need some advice, Caine. You are the expert on women,\" he added in a matter-of-fact tone of voice.\\n\\n That announcement was news to Caine, and he was about to ask Nathan how he had come to that conclusion, but his brother-in-law answered him before the question was asked. \"Jade never would have settled. If anything, my sister is discriminating.\"\\n\\n Caine started to grin, then frowned instead when Nathan casually added, \"I still can\u0027t figure it. You must have something only she can… appreciate.\"\\n\\n Caine wasn\u0027t given a chance to respond to that barb. \"I need your help with Luther Grant,\" Nathan announced.\\n\\n \"For God\u0027s sake, Nathan, will you quit jumping back and forth between issues? You just asked for advice concerning women, and now you\u0027re—\"\\n\\n \"Grant\u0027s got to talk to us,\" Nathan insisted.\\n\\n Caine leaned back in his chair. \"I was going after the bastard anyway, Nathan. He\u0027ll get what\u0027s coming to him.\"\\n\\n \"He might be on the run,\" Nathan said.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t borrow trouble,\" Caine said. \"We\u0027ll find out soon enough.\"\\n\\n \"He has to admit his part in this scheme before Farnmount\u0027s ball. If Grant has taken off, that only gives us two days to find him.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll have his signed confession before then,\" Caine promised. \"But why is Farnmount\u0027s ball your deadline, Nathan?\"\\n\\n \"Everyone comes back to London to attend, that\u0027s why.\"\\n\\n \"You never attend.\"\\n\\n \"I will this year.\"\\n\\n Caine nodded. \"You know, Nathan, I always enjoy the affair. It\u0027s the only ball your friendly St. James relatives attend.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s the only ball they\u0027re ever invited to attend,\" Nathan drawled. He leaned against the window ledge and smiled at his brother-in-law.\\n\\n Caine still didn\u0027t understand what Nathan was planning. He knew prodding wouldn\u0027t do him any good. Nathan would tell him when he was ready. \"Everyone\u0027s afraid to go to the ball for worry that he will be your Uncle Dunnford\u0027s next victim,\" Caine remarked. He smiled when he added, \"But they\u0027re also afraid to miss the fiasco. Dunnford does provide some refreshing entertainment. He reminds me of Attila the Hun dressed in formal attire. Now that I think about it, so do you, Nathan.\"\\n\\n His brother-in-law barely heard what Caine was rambling on about. His mind was centered on his plans. Another minute or two passed before he said, \"The prince regent always attends the party, too.\"\\n\\n A sudden gleam came into Caine\u0027s eyes. He leaned forward in his chair. \"Yes,\" he agreed. \"And so do all the Winchesters, now that I think about it.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m only interested in one Winchester,\" Nathan said. \"Winston.\"\\n\\n \"Do you think that\u0027s when he plans to spring his scandal about your father? Hell, yes, it is,\" Caine continued. \"What better opportunity?\"\\n\\n \"Can you set up a meeting with Sir Richards? I want to fill him in on the facts as soon as possible.\"\\n\\n \"The director of our War Section already knows about Grant. I spoke with him just this morning. He should be visiting with the bastard right about now.\"\\n\\n \"Unless he\u0027s gone into hiding,\" Nathan muttered.\\n\\n \"He doesn\u0027t have any reason to think we know about him. Quit worrying about Grant and tell me what you plan to do.\"\\n\\n Nathan nodded. He then proceeded to explain what he wanted to do. When he finished Caine was smiling. \"If luck is on our side, we should be able to set the meeting as early as tomorrow afternoon, Nathan.\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" his brother-in-law answered. He straightened away from the window. \"Now, about Sara. Someone has to keep a close watch on her until this has been resolved. I don\u0027t want the Winchesters to get hold of her while I\u0027m seeing to the details. If anything happened to her, Caine, I don\u0027t know what…\" He didn\u0027t go on.\\n\\n \"Jimbo\u0027s in the kitchen, eating the shelves dry. He already made it clear he\u0027s protecting Sara. He won\u0027t let her leave here. Jade and I will also keep a close watch. You don\u0027t think you\u0027ll make it back here before tonight?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll try,\" Nathan said. \"Right now I\u0027ve got to talk to Colin. It\u0027s only fair that my partner agree to my plan before I proceed.\"\\n\\n \"At the risk of sounding completely ignorant, why does Colin need to give his agreement about Grant?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not talking about Grant now,\" Nathan explained. \"I\u0027m talking about Sara. God, Caine, pay attention.\"\\n\\n Caine let out a long sigh. \"I\u0027m trying.\"\\n\\n \"I have one more favor to ask you.\"\\n\\n \"Yes?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re always calling Jade by those ridiculous endearments.\"\\n\\n \"Jade likes hearing those ridiculous endearments,\" he muttered.\\n\\n \"Exactly my point,\" Nathan said with a quick nod. \"Sara will like them, too.\"\\n\\n Caine looked incredulous. \"You want me to call Sara by the same endearments I call my wife?\"\\n\\n \"Of course not,\" Nathan snapped. \"I want you to write them down on a piece of paper for me.\"\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"So I\u0027ll know what the hell they are,\" Nathan bellowed. \"Damn, you\u0027re making this difficult. Just write them down, all right? Leave the paper on the desk for me.\"\\n\\n Caine didn\u0027t dare laugh. He did smile, though. The picture of Nathan referring to notes while he tried to woo Sara was quite amusing. \"Yes, I\u0027ll leave it on the desk for you,\" he said when Nathan glared at him.\\n\\n Nathan started to leave. \"Are you even going to look in on Sara before you go?\" Caine asked.\\n\\n Nathan shook his head. \"I have to get everything ready first.\"\\n\\n The worry in his voice wasn\u0027t lost on Caine. \"The love words aren\u0027t necessary, Nathan, if you just tell her what\u0027s in your heart.\"\\n\\n His brother-in-law didn\u0027t respond to that suggestion. Caine finally understood. \"You\u0027re afraid to confront her, aren\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"The hell I am,\" Nathan roared. \"I just want it to be right.\"\\n\\n Jade was just passing by the library door when she heard her husband\u0027s laughter. She paused to listen, but the only snatch of conversation she caught didn\u0027t make any sense to her.\\n\\n Nathan had just announced that come hell or high water, he was going to fix his flower. He just needed time to find out how.\\n\\n Now what in heaven\u0027s name did that mean, Jade wondered.\\n\\n Chapter Fifteen\\n\\n Sara spent the afternoon in the guest bedroom. She sat in a chair near the window and tried to read one of the leather-bound books Jade had brought up for her. She couldn\u0027t concentrate on the story, though, and ended up staring down at the small flower garden behind the town-house. All Sara could think about was Nathan and what an ignorant country mouse she\u0027d been to love him.\\n\\n Why couldn\u0027t he love her?\\n\\n She asked herself that painful question every ten minutes or so but never did come up with a proper answer. The future terrified her. She\u0027d already made up her mind to break the contract so that her family couldn\u0027t have the king\u0027s gift; but once the scandal was made known about Nathan\u0027s father, wouldn\u0027t the prince regent be placed in the position of having to withhold the royal gift from Nathan as well?\\n\\n Sara couldn\u0027t allow that. Her father had used trickery and deceit to gain the advantage over Nathan. Sara was determined to find a way to even the odds. She didn\u0027t want to live with a man who didn\u0027t love her, so she decided to strike a bargain with Nathan. In return for her signature giving up all rights to the gift Nathan would let Matthew take her with him when he returned to Nora\u0027s island.\\n\\n Lord, there was so much to consider. The unfairness of what her father had done shamed her. She decided then that her only hope was to gain the prince regent\u0027s support. The thought of having to plead her case to him sent a shiver down her spine.\\n\\n George, the future king of England once his father died or was, as the rumors were whispering, officially declared insane, was a handsome, well-educated man. Those were, unfortunately, his only good points. Sara disliked him immensely. He was a spoiled, pleasure-seeking fop who rarely placed his country\u0027s concerns above his own. His worst flaw, to Sara\u0027s way of thinking, was his trait of changing his mind on any matter. Sara knew she wasn\u0027t the only one who disliked the prince. He was extremely unpopular with the masses, and just a few months past she\u0027d heard that the windows of his carriage had been broken by angry subjects. George was in the conveyance at the time, said to be on his way to Parliament.\\n\\n Still, she didn\u0027t have anyone else to turn to, and so she penned a note to the prince requesting an audience the following afternoon. She sealed the envelope and was just about to go into the corridor to ask Sterns to send a messenger over to Carlton House when Caine intercepted her.\\n\\n He\u0027d come to fetch her for dinner. Sara was most polite when she refused his invitation, insisting that she really wasn\u0027t hungry. Caine was just as polite when he insisted that she eat something. The man wouldn\u0027t take no for an answer. He told her so as he coaxed her along the hallway.\\n\\n Jimbo was waiting in the foyer. Sara handed him the envelope and asked him to deliver the letter for her. Caine reached over Sara\u0027s head and plucked the letter out of the seaman\u0027s hands before he could agree to undertake the errand.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll have one of the servants take it over,\" Caine explained. \"Jimbo, escort Lady Sara into the dining room. I won\u0027t be a minute.\"\\n\\n As soon as Jimbo and Sara turned the corner Caine opened the envelope, read the letter, and put it in his pocket. He waited another minute or two and then strolled into the dining room.\\n\\n Jimbo sat next to Sara at the long table. Jade was seated directly across from her. Caine took his place at the head of the table and then rang for the servants to begin.\\n\\n \"Though it was probably very rude of me to notice, I did see that the letter was addressed to our prince regent,\" Caine began.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know of anyone else living in Carlton House,\" Jimbo interjected.\\n\\n Caine frowned at the seaman. \"Yes, but I didn\u0027t realize Sara was on personal terms with the prince.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, I\u0027m not on personal terms with the prince,\" she rushed out. \"I don\u0027t even like…\" She stopped in mid-explanation, then blushed. She lowered her gaze to the table. \"I apologize. I do tend to blurt out whatever\u0027s on my mind,\" she confessed. \"As far as the note is concerned, I requested an audience. I hope that the prince will see me tomorrow afternoon.\"\\n\\n \"Why?\" Jade asked. \"Sara, the prince is certainly in your father\u0027s camp.\"\\n\\n \"I do hope you\u0027re wrong, Jade.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m afraid my wife\u0027s correct in that evaluation, Sara,\" Caine said. \"When the prince made it known he wanted to divorce his wife, Caroline, your father was one of a handful who supported him.\"\\n\\n \"But won\u0027t the prince put personal considerations aside and come to a loyal subject\u0027s aid?\"\\n\\n Her innocence was both refreshing and alarming. Caine didn\u0027t want her to be disappointed. \"No,\" Caine said. \"His own considerations always come first. The man changes his views as often as he changes his ministers, Sara. Anything he would promise you shouldn\u0027t be counted on. I\u0027m sorry to sound disloyal, but I\u0027m being completely honest with you. I don\u0027t want you to get your hopes up only to have them dashed. Let Nathan fight this battle, Sara. Stand by his side and let him handle your father.\"\\n\\n She shook her head. \"Do you know I refused to learn how to swim?\" she blurted out. \"I thought I shouldn\u0027t have to know how, you see, because it was Nathan\u0027s duty to make certain I didn\u0027t drown. I\u0027ve been perfectly willing to take care of everyone but myself. Now you suggest I let Nathan fight my battles. It\u0027s wrong, Caine. I\u0027ve been wrong. I don\u0027t want ever to cling to anyone. I should have enough strength to stand on my own. I want to be strong, damn it.\"\\n\\n She turned bright pink after she\u0027d finished her impassioned speech. \"Please excuse my gutter language,\" she whispered.\\n\\n An awkward silence followed that remark. Jimbo filled the space with a couple of spicy stories about his sea adventures.\\n\\n The dessert tray was just being removed from the table when Jade asked, \"Have you seen our beautiful daughter yet?\" She\u0027d blurted out that question in an attempt to keep Sara at the table awhile longer. She wanted to bring the conversation around to Nathan, of course. Jade was determined to interfere. It was such a heartache to see Sara looking so desolate and alone.\\n\\n Sara actually smiled at the mention of the infant. \"I\u0027ve heard your daughter,\" she confessed. \"But I\u0027ve yet to see her. Sterns has promised me that this evening he\u0027ll let me hold Olivia.\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s such a delightful baby,\" Jade announced. \"She\u0027s smiling all the time now. She\u0027s very intelligent, too. Caine and I noticed that right away.\"\\n\\n Jade continued to expound on her three-month-old\u0027s considerable accomplishments. Sara noticed that after each of Jade\u0027s boasts, Caine immediately nodded his agreement.\\n\\n \"Olivia\u0027s blessed to have such loving parents.\"\\n\\n \"Nathan will make a wonderful father,\" Jade interjected.\\n\\n Sara didn\u0027t comment.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you agree, husband?\" Jade asked Caine.\\n\\n \"If he ever learns to lower his voice, he will.\"\\n\\n Jade kicked her husband while she continued to smile at Sara. \"Nathan has so many wonderful qualities,\" she announced.\\n\\n Sara didn\u0027t want to talk about Nathan, but she felt it would be rude not to show some interest. \"Oh? And what might those qualities be?\" she asked. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-gift-crown-s-spies-3/page-39.html","bookId":1790,"book":{"id":1790,"title":"The Gift (Crown\u0027s Spies #3)","description":"Storyline: A child bride, Sara Winchester had grown into a winsome beauty, joyfully anticipating the day when her husband Nathan, Marquess of St. James, would return to claim her heart at last.
