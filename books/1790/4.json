{"id":78535,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"Sara should have realized that fact sooner. She never would have allowed Nora to come home for a visit otherwise. Heaven help her, she\u0027d actually believed that time had softened her uncles\u0027 attitude. The sad truth was quite the opposite. There wasn\u0027t a happy reunion allowed between the sisters. Sara\u0027s mother didn\u0027t even get to speak to Nora. As to that, no one did, for Nora had simply vanished a scant hour after she and Sara had left the ship.\\n\\n Sara was nearly out of her mind with worry. The time had finally come to put her plan into action, and her nerves were at the screaming point. Her fear had become an almost tangible thing, tearing at her determination. She was accustomed to letting other people take care of her, but the shoe was on the other foot, as Nora liked to say, and Sara needed to be the one in charge. She prayed to God she was up to the challenge. Nora\u0027s life depended upon her success.\\n\\n The horrendous pretense Sara had had to endure the past two weeks had become a nightmare. Each time she heard the door chime sound she was certain the authorities had come to tell her Nora\u0027s body had been found. Finally, when she thought she couldn\u0027t stand the worry another minute, her faithful servant Nicholas had found out where her uncles had hidden Aunt Nora. The gentle woman had been closeted away in the attic of her Uncle Henry\u0027s townhouse until all the arrangements could be made with the court for guardianship. Then she was going to be spirited away to the nearest asylum, with her fat inheritance divided between the other men in the family.\\n\\n \"The bloody leeches,\" Sara muttered to herself. Her hand shook when she clipped the latch shut on her satchel. She told herself it was anger and certainly not fear that made her tremble so. Every time she thought about the terror her aunt must be going through she became infuriated all over again.\\n\\n She took a deep, calming breath as she carried her satchel over to the open window. She tossed the garment bag down to the ground. \"That\u0027s the last of it, Nicholas. Hurry now before the family returns. Godspeed, friend.\"\\n\\n The servant collected the last bag and rushed toward the waiting hack. Sara closed the window, doused the candle, and climbed into bed.\\n\\n It was almost the midnight hour when her parents and her sister Belinda returned from their outing. When Sara heard the footsteps in the hallway she rolled onto her stomach, closed her eyes, and feigned sleep. A moment later she heard the squeak of the door as it was opened and knew her father was looking in to see that his daughter was where she was supposed to be. It seemed to Sara an eternity passed before the door was pulled shut again.\\n\\n Sara waited another twenty minutes or so to let the household settle down for the night. Then she slipped out from under the covers and collected her belongings from where she\u0027d hidden them under the bed. She needed to be inconspicuous on her journey. Since she didn\u0027t own anything black, she wore her old dark blue walking dress. The neckline was a little too revealing, but she didn\u0027t have time to worry about that problem. Besides, her cloak would conceal that flaw. She was too nervous to braid her hair and had to settle on tying it behind her neck with a ribbon so it would stay out of her way.\\n\\n After she\u0027d placed the letter she\u0027d written to her mother on the dressing table she wrapped her parasol, white gloves, and reticule in her cloak. She tossed those possessions out the window, then climbed out on the ledge.\\n\\n The branch she wanted to grasp was just two feet away but a good three to four feet below her. Sara said a quick prayer she\u0027d make it as she wiggled closer to the edge. She sat there a long while until she could summon up enough courage to jump. Then, with a whimper of fear she couldn\u0027t contain, she pushed herself off the ledge.\\n\\n Nathan couldn\u0027t believe what he was seeing. He was just about to climb up the giant tree when the window opened and various articles belonging to a woman came flying down. The parasol hit him on his shoulder. He dodged the other items and moved deeper into the shadows. The moon gave him sufficient light to see Sara when she climbed out on the ledge. He was about to shout a warning, certain she was going to break her neck, when she suddenly jumped. He raced forward to catch her.\\n\\n Sara caught hold of a fat branch and held on for dear life. She said another prayer to keep herself from crying out. Then she waited until she quit swinging back and forth so violently and slowly wiggled her way toward the trunk.\\n\\n \"Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.\" She whispered that litany all the way down the tree. Her dress got tangled up in another branch, and by the time her feet finally touched the ground the hem of her gown had worked its way up and over her head.\\n\\n Sara righted her dress and let out a long, ragged sigh. \"There now,\" she whispered. \"That wasn\u0027t so horrible after all.\"\\n\\n Lord, she thought, she was starting to lie to herself. She knelt down on the ground, gathered up her possessions, mumbling all the while, and wasted precious minutes putting on her white gloves. Dusting her cloak off took a bit longer. After she\u0027d adjusted the garment around her shoulders she untwisted the strings of her reticule, slipped the satin cords around her wrist, tucked the parasol under her arm, and finally walked toward the front of the house.\\n\\n She stopped quite suddenly, certain she heard a sound behind her. Yet when she whirled around she didn\u0027t see anything but trees and shadows. Her imagination was getting the better of her, she decided. It was probably just her own heartbeat making all the ruckus in her ears.\\n\\n \"Where is Nicholas?\" she muttered to herself a short time later. The servant was supposed to be waiting for her in the shadows next to the front stoop. Nicholas had promised to escort her to her Uncle Henry Winchester\u0027s townhouse. Something must have happened to waylay him, she decided.\\n\\n Another ten minutes passed before Sara accepted the fact that Nicholas wasn\u0027t going to return to fetch her. She didn\u0027t dare wait any longer. There was too much risk of being found out. Since her return to London two weeks before her father had taken to the habit of looking in on her during the night. There would be hell to pay when he realized she\u0027d run away again. Sara shivered just thinking about the consequences.\\n\\n She was completely on her own. That admission made her heartbeat go wild again. She straightened her shoulders and then started walking toward her destination.\\n\\n Uncle Henry\u0027s townhouse was just three short blocks away. It shouldn\u0027t take her any time at all to walk over there. Besides, it was the middle of the night, and surely the streets would be deserted. Villains needed their rest, too, didn\u0027t they? Lord, she certainly hoped so. She would fare all right, she told herself as she hurried down the street. If anyone tried to waylay her, she\u0027d use her parasol as a weapon to defend herself. She was determined to go to any length to save her Aunt Nora from having to spend one more night under her uncle\u0027s sadistic supervision.\\n\\n Sara ran like lightning the first full block. A stitch in her side forced her to slow down to a more sedate pace. She relaxed a little when she realized she was actually quite safe. There didn\u0027t seem to be anyone else on the streets that night. Sara smiled over that blessing.\\n\\n Nathan followed behind. He wanted to appease his curiosity before he grabbed his bride, tossed her over his shoulder, and headed for the wharf. In the back of his mind was the irritating thought that she might be trying to run away from him again. He discarded that notion as foolish, for she couldn\u0027t possibly know about his plans to kidnap her.\\n\\n Where was she going? He mulled that question over in his mind while he continued to trail her.\\n\\n She did have gumption, though. He found that revelation astonishing, since she was a Winchester. Yet she\u0027d already shown him a glimpse of real courage. He\u0027d heard her cry out in obvious fear when she\u0027d thrown herself off that ledge. The woman had gotten herself caught up in the branches, too, then prayed her way down to the ground in a low, fervent voice that had made him smile. He\u0027d gotten a healthy view of her long, shapely legs while she was in such an unseemly position and had to restrain himself from laughing out loud.\\n\\n It soon became evident to him that she was still blissfully oblivious to his presence. Nathan couldn\u0027t believe her naivete. If she\u0027d only bothered to look behind her, she certainly would have seen him.\\n\\n She never bothered to look back. His bride rounded the first corner, passed a dark alley at a brisker pace, then slowed down again.\\n\\n She hadn\u0027t gone unnoticed. Two burly men, their weapons at the ready, slithered out of their makeshift home like snakes. Nathan was right behind them. He made certain they heard his approach, then waited until they were turning around to confront him before he slammed their heads together.\\n\\n Nathan tossed the garbage back into the alley, his gaze directed on Sara all the while. The way his bride strolled down the street should be outlawed, he thought to himself. The sway of her h*ps was too damn enticing. Just then he saw another movement in the shadows ahead. He rushed forward to save Sara once again. She\u0027d just turned the second corner when his fist slammed into her would-be attacker\u0027s jaw.\\n\\n He had to intervene on her behalf yet again before she finally reached her destination. He assumed she was going to call on her Uncle Henry Winchester when she paused on the bottom step of his residence and stared up at the dark windows a long while.\\n\\n Of all her relatives, Nathan thought Henry was the most disreputable, and he couldn\u0027t come up with a single logical reason why Sara would want to call on the spineless bastard in the middle of the night.\\n\\n She wasn\u0027t there for a visit. Nathan came to that conclusion when she crept around to the side of the townhouse. He followed her, then lounged against the side gate to keep other intruders out. He folded his arms across his chest and relaxed his stance while he watched her fight her way through the shrubs and breach the house through the window.\\n\\n It was the most inept burglary he\u0027d ever witnessed.\\n\\n She spent at least ten minutes working the window all the way up. That simple accomplishment was a short victory, though. She was just about to hoist herself up onto the ledge when she tore the hem of her gown. Nathan heard her cry of distress, then watched her turn and give full attention to her gown. The window slid back down while Sara lamented over the damage.\\n\\n If she had a needle and thread handy, he thought she might very well sit down next to the shrubs and repair the dress.\\n\\n She finally turned back to her purpose, though. She thought she was being quite clever when she used her parasol to prop the window open. She adjusted the strings of her reticule around her wrist before she jumped up to grab hold of the ledge. It took her three tries before she made it. Getting in through a window proved to be far more difficult than getting out through one. She fairly knocked the wind out of herself before she finally made it. She wasn\u0027t at all graceful, either. When Nathan heard the loud thud he decided his bride had landed on either her head or her backside. He waited only a minute or two before he silently climbed in after her.\\n\\n He adjusted to the darkness quickly. Sara didn\u0027t make the adjustment quite as swiftly, however. Nathan heard a loud crash that sounded like glass hitting stone, followed by an unladylike expletive.\\n\\n Lord, she was loud. Nathan strolled into the foyer just in time to see Sara rush up the steps to the second story. The crazed woman was actually muttering to herself.\\n\\n A tall, willow-thin man Nathan assumed was one of the servants drew his attention then. The man looked ridiculous. He was dressed in a white knee-length nightshirt. He carried an ornately carved candlestick in one hand and a large crust of bread in the other. The servant lifted the candlestick above his head and started up the steps after Sara. Nathan clipped him on the back of his neck, reached over his head to take the candlestick out of his hand so it wouldn\u0027t make a clatter when it hit the floor, then dragged the servant into a dark alcove adjacent to the stairs. He stood next to the crumpled form a long minute while he listened to all the racket coming from above the stairs.\\n\\n Sara would never make a proper thief. He could hear the doors being slammed shut and knew it was his bride making all the noise. She was going to wake the dead if she didn\u0027t quiet down. And what in God\u0027s name was she looking for?\\n\\n A shrill scream rent the air. Nathan let out a weary sigh. He started toward the stairs to save the daft woman once again, then suddenly stopped when she appeared at the landing. She wasn\u0027t alone. Nathan moved back into the alcove and waited. He understood the reason for her errand. Sara had her arm around another woman\u0027s stooped shoulders and was assisting her down the stairs. He couldn\u0027t see the other woman\u0027s face, but he could tell from her slow, hesitant walk that she was either very feeble or in terrible pain.\\n\\n \"Please don\u0027t cry, Nora,\" Sara whispered. \"Everything\u0027s going to be fine now. I\u0027m going to take good care of you.\"\\n\\n When the pair reached the foyer Sara took off her cloak, adjusted it around the other woman\u0027s shoulders, and then leaned forward to kiss her on her forehead.\\n\\n \"I knew you would come for me, Sara. I never doubted. I knew in my heart that you would find a way to help me.\"\\n\\n Nora\u0027s voice cracked with emotion. She mopped at the corners of her eyes with the backs of her hands. Nathan noticed the dark bruises on her wrists. He recognized the marks. The old woman had obviously been tied up.\\n\\n Sara reached up to adjust the pins in her aunt\u0027s hair. \"Of course you knew I would come for you,\" she whispered. \"I love you, Aunt Nora. I would never let anything happen to you. There,\" she added in as cheerful a tone of voice as she could manage, \"your hair looks lovely again.\"\\n\\n Nora grasped Sara\u0027s hand. \"Whatever would I do without you, child?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s a foolish worry,\" Sara answered. She kept her voice soothing, for she knew her aunt was in jeopardy of losing her control. Sara was actually in much the same condition. When she\u0027d seen the bruises on her aunt\u0027s face and arms she\u0027d wanted to weep.\\n\\n \"You came back to England because I asked you to,\" Sara reminded her. \"I thought you would have a happy reunion with your sister, but I was wrong. This atrocity is all my fault, Nora. Besides, you must know you\u0027re never going to have to do without me.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re such a dear child,\" Nora answered.\\n\\n Sara\u0027s hand shook when she reached for the door lock. \"How did you find me?\" Nora asked from behind.\\n\\n \"It doesn\u0027t matter now,\" Sara said. She worked the lock free and opened the door. \"We\u0027re going to have all the time in the world to visit after we\u0027ve boarded the ship. I\u0027m taking you back home, Nora.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, I can\u0027t leave London just yet.\"\\n\\n Sara turned around to look at her aunt. \"What do you mean, you can\u0027t leave just yet? Everything\u0027s been arranged, Nora. I\u0027ve booked passage with the last of my funds. Please don\u0027t shake your head at me. Now isn\u0027t the time to turn difficult. We have to leave tonight. It\u0027s too dangerous for you to stay here.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-gift-crown-s-spies-3/page-4.html","bookId":1790,"book":{"id":1790,"title":"The Gift (Crown\u0027s Spies #3)","description":"Storyline: A child bride, Sara Winchester had grown into a winsome beauty, joyfully anticipating the day when her husband Nathan, Marquess of St. James, would return to claim her heart at last.
