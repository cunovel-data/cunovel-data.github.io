And Sara did set the fire. That\u0027s a fact, all right.\"\\n\\n The two men turned to leave the cabin. They both thought Nathan needed to be alone for a spell. Nathan\u0027s shout stopped them in their tracks. \"Bring her to me. Now.\"\\n\\n Jimbo motioned for Matthew to stay where he was and then rushed out the doorway. He didn\u0027t give Sara any warning of the problem at hand when he found her in Nora\u0027s cabin but simply informed her that her husband would like to have a word with her.\\n\\n Sara hurried back to her cabin. Her eyes widened when she saw all the water on the floor. A loud gasp followed after she noticed the gaping hole in the corner.\\n\\n \"My God, what has happened here?\"\\n\\n Nathan turned to look at her before answering. \"Fire.\"\\n\\n Understanding came in a flash. \"Fire?\" she repeated in a hoarse whisper. \"Do you mean the fire in the hearth, Nathan?\"\\n\\n He didn\u0027t answer her for a long, long minute. Then he slowly walked over to stand directly in front of her. His hands were close enough to grab her by the neck.\\n\\n He resisted that shameful temptation by clasping his hands behind his back.\\n\\n She wasn\u0027t looking at him. That helped. Her gaze was still fully directed on the damage to the cabin. She worried her lower lip with her teeth, and when she began to tremble Nathan guessed she\u0027d realized exactly what she\u0027d done.\\n\\n He was wrong. \"I never should have left the hearth unattended,\" she whispered. \"Did a spark…\"\\n\\n He shook his head.\\n\\n She looked into his eyes then. Her fear was obvious.\\n\\n He immediately lost some of his rage. Damn if he\u0027d have her afraid of him. It was an illogical thought, given the circumstances, yet there it was, nagging him to ease his scowl.\\n\\n \"Sara?\" His voice sounded quite mild.\\n\\n He sounded furious to her. She forced herself to stay where she was, though the urge to back away from him was nearly overpowering. \"Yes, Nathan?\" she replied, her gaze directed on the floor.\\n\\n \"Look at me.\"\\n\\n She looked. He saw the tears in her eyes. The sight tore the rest of his fury right out of him.\\n\\n His sigh was long, ragged.\\n\\n \"Was there something you wanted to say to me?\" she asked when he continued to stare intently at her.\\n\\n \"It isn\u0027t a hearth.\"\\n\\n Nathan walked out of the cabin. Sara stared after him a long minute before turning around to look at Matthew and Jimbo.\\n\\n \"Did he just say that the hearth isn\u0027t a hearth?\"\\n\\n The two men nodded in unison.\\n\\n Her shoulders slumped. \"It looks like a hearth.\"\\n\\n \"Well, it isn\u0027t,\" Matthew announced. He nudged Jimbo in his side. \"You explain it.\"\\n\\n Jimbo nodded, then told Sara that the metal parts stacked in the corner of the cabin had been carted back from Nathan\u0027s last trip. They were to be used to repair the old stove in the Emerald Shipping Company offices. Nathan had just forgotten to take the parts off the ship when they\u0027d docked, Jimbo continued, though he was certain the captain wouldn\u0027t be forgetting next time.\\n\\n Matthew finished up the explanation by telling Sara that the trap was simply an air duct and nothing more. It wasn\u0027t a chimney.\\n\\n Lady Sara\u0027s face looked as red as fire by the time the two men had given her their explanations. She then thanked them for their patience. She felt like an ignorant fool. \"I could have killed everyone,\" she whispered.\\n\\n \"Aye, you could have,\" Matthew agreed.\\n\\n She burst into tears. The two men were nearly undone by the emotional show. Jimbo glared at Matthew.\\n\\n Matthew suddenly felt like a father trying to comfort his daughter. He took Sara into his arms and awkwardly patted her on her back.\\n\\n \"There now, Sara, it\u0027s not so bad,\" Jimbo said, trying to soothe her. \"You couldn\u0027t have known it wasn\u0027t a hearth.\"\\n\\n \"An idiot would have known,\" she cried out.\\n\\n The two men nodded to each other over the top of Sara\u0027s head. Then Matthew said, \"I might have thought it was a hearth if I…\" He couldn\u0027t go on because he couldn\u0027t think of a plausible lie.\\n\\n Jimbo came to his aid. \"Anyone would have thought it was a hearth if he wasn\u0027t used to sailing much.\"\\n\\n Nathan stood in the doorway. He couldn\u0027t believe what he was seeing. Jimbo and Matthew, two of the most bloodless pirates he\u0027d ever had the honor to work with, were now acting like nursemaids. He would have laughed if his attention hadn\u0027t wandered over to the fire damage just then. He frowned instead.\\n\\n \"When you\u0027re through beating bruises in my wife\u0027s back, Matthew, you might want to have some of the men clean up this mess.\"\\n\\n Nathan turned to Jimbo next. \"The planks went through the lower level, too. See to righting the damage, Jimbo. Matthew, if you don\u0027t get your hands off my wife, I\u0027ll…\"\\n\\n He didn\u0027t have to finish that threat. Matthew was halfway out the door by the time Nathan reached Sara. \"If anyone is to comfort my wife, it\u0027s going to be me.\"\\n\\n He jerked Sara into his arms and shoved her face against his chest. Jimbo didn\u0027t dare break into a smile until he\u0027d exited the room. He did let out a rich chuckle after he\u0027d closed the door behind him, however.\\n\\n Nathan continued to hold Sara for a few more minutes. His irritation got the better of him then. \"God, wife, aren\u0027t you through crying yet?\"\\n\\n She mopped her face on the front of his shirt, then eased away from him. \"I do try not to cry, but sometimes I can\u0027t seem to help it.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve noticed,\" he remarked.\\n\\n He dragged her over to the bed, shoved her down, and then felt sufficiently calm to give her a firm lecture on the one overriding fear each and every seaman harbored. Fire. He paced the room, his big hands clasped behind his back, while he gave his speech. He was calm, logical, thorough.\\n\\n He was shouting at her by the time he\u0027d finished. She didn\u0027t dare mention that fact to him, though. The vein in the side of his temple throbbed noticeably, and she concluded her husband wasn\u0027t quite over his anger.\\n\\n She watched him pace and shout and grumble, and in those minutes when he was being his surly self she realized how very much she really loved him. He was trying to be so kind to her. He didn\u0027t know he was, of course, but there he stood, blaming himself, Jimbo and Matthew, and even God for bringing on the fire because no one had bothered to explain ship life to her.\\n\\n She wanted to throw herself into his arms and tell him that even though she had always loved him, the feeling had become much more… vivid, much more real. She felt such peace, such contentment. It was as though she\u0027d been on a journey all those years while she waited for him and was home at last.\\n\\n Nathan drew her attention by demanding she answer him. He had to repeat his question, of course, for she\u0027d been daydreaming and had no idea what he\u0027d asked. He only looked a little irritated by her lack of attention, and Sara guessed he was finally getting used to her. God only knew she was getting used to his flaws. The man was all bluster. Oh, his scowl, when set upon her fully, could still give her the hives, but Nora had been right after all. There really was a good, kind man behind the mask.\\n\\n Nathan finally finished his lecture. When he asked her she immediately gave him her promise that she wouldn\u0027t touch anything else on his ship until they were in port.\\n\\n Nathan was content. After he left the cabin Sara spent long hours scrubbing the mess. She was exhausted by the time she\u0027d changed the bedding and had her own bath, but she was determined to wait up for her husband. She wanted to fall asleep in his arms.\\n\\n Sara pulled her sketch pad from the trunk, sat down at the table, and drew a picture of her husband. The paper didn\u0027t seem big enough to accommodate his size. She smiled over that fanciful notion. He was just a man. Her man. The likeness was remarkably well done, she thought, though she refused to put a frown on his face. She\u0027d captured his Viking stance, too, with his muscular legs braced apart and his hands settled on his hips. His hair flowed down behind his neck, and she wished she had her colors so she could show the magnificence of his auburn hair and his beautiful green eyes. Perhaps when they reached Nora\u0027s home she could buy new supplies so that she could do a proper sketch of her husband.\\n\\n It was well after midnight when Nathan came back down to the cabin. Sara was sound asleep. She was curled up like a kitten in the chair. Her long curly hair hid most of her face, and she looked utterly feminine to him.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t know how long he stood there staring at her.\\n\\n God, it felt right to have her close to him. He couldn\u0027t understand why he felt such contentment, even admitting that it was a dangerous reaction, for there wasn\u0027t any way in hell he would allow a woman to mean more to him than baggage would.\\n\\n She was simply a means to an end, he told himself. And that was all.\\n\\n Nathan stripped, washed, then went over to the table. He saw the sketch pad and gently pried it out of her grasp. Curiosity caught him, and he slowly thumbed through the work she\u0027d done. There were a good ten or twelve drawings completed. They were all sketches of him.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t know how to react. The drawings were amazingly well done. She\u0027d certainly captured his size, his strength. But then her mind had taken a fanciful turn, he decided, for damn if he wasn\u0027t smiling in every last one of them.\\n\\n Sara really was a hopeless romantic. The old woman had told him that Sara\u0027s head was in the clouds most of the time. He knew that comment wasn\u0027t exaggeration.\\n\\n Yes, his wife was a foolish dreamer. And yet he stood there, lingering over one particular drawing for a long, long while. It was all wrong, of course, but it still held him mesmerized.\\n\\n The picture showed him from the back, standing on the deck, next to the wheel, looking off into the fading sunset. It was as though she\u0027d sneaked up behind him to catch him unawares. His hands were clasped on the wheel. He was barefoot and shirtless. Only a hint of his profile was visible, just enough to tell that he was supposed to be smiling.\\n\\n There weren\u0027t any scars on his back.\\n\\n Had she forgotten about them, or had she decided she didn\u0027t want to include his scars in her work? Nathan decided the issue wasn\u0027t important enough to think about any longer. He had scars, and she\u0027d damn well better accept them. He shook his head over that ridiculous reaction, then lifted Sara into his arms and put her to bed.\\n\\n Nathan left the trap open so that the cabin would be rid of the lingering smoke, and he stretched out next to her.\\n\\n She immediately rolled over and cuddled up against his side. \"Nathan?\"\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n He made his voice as harsh as possible so she\u0027d realize that he didn\u0027t want to talk to her.\\n\\n His message was lost on her. She scooted closer to him and put her hand on his chest. Her fingers toyed with the thick hair until he flattened his own hand on top of hers. \"Stop that,\" he ordered.\\n\\n She put her head down on his shoulder. \"Why do you think I\u0027m having such a difficult time adjusting to ship life?\" she asked in a whisper.\\n\\n He answered her with a shrug that would have sent her flying into the wall if he hadn\u0027t been holding her.\\n\\n \"Do you think it might be because I\u0027m not used to running a vessel?\"\\n\\n He rolled his eyes heavenward. \"You aren\u0027t supposed to run my ship,\" he answered. \"I am.\"\\n\\n \"But as your wife I should—\"\\n\\n \"Go to sleep.\"\\n\\n \"Help,\" she said at the very same time.\\n\\n She kissed the side of his neck. \"I\u0027ll do much better when we\u0027re on land, Nathan. I can run a large household, and—\"\\n\\n \"For God\u0027s sake, Sara, you don\u0027t have to run through your list of accomplishments again.\"\\n\\n She stiffened against him, then relaxed. She must have finally decided to obey him, he thought to himself. The woman was going to go to sleep.\\n\\n \"Nathan?\"\\n\\n He should have known better, he told himself. She wasn\u0027t going to sleep until she was good and ready.\\n\\n \"What is it?\"\\n\\n \"You forgot to kiss me goodnight.\"\\n\\n God, she was aggravating. Nathan let out a weary sigh. He knew he wouldn\u0027t get any sleep until he gave in to her. His wife could be quite singleminded. She was more nuisance than not, he told himself. At the moment he was hard pressed to think of any redeeming qualities she might possess. Why, she was as stubborn as a mule, as bossy as a mother-in-law, and those were just two of the numerous flaws he\u0027d already noticed.\\n\\n He did kiss her, though, fast and hard, just to get her to quit nagging him. Damn but she tasted good, he thought. He had to kiss her again. He used his tongue. So did she. The kiss was far more thorough, more arousing.\\n\\n She squeezed herself up against him. The provocation was too much to resist. She was all soft and feminine. He had to make love to her then. He didn\u0027t even make her nag him into doing that duty. She was still a little resistant, though. When he ordered her to take her nightgown off and turned to light the candle she asked him to leave them in darkness. He told her no, that he wanted to watch her, and she turned crimson before trying to hide her body from him by pulling the covers up to her chin.\\n\\n He tossed the blankets aside and set about the task of wooing the shyness out of her. In no time at all she became quite brazen. She wanted to touch him everywhere with her hands and her mouth. He let her have her way, of course, until he was so hot for her he was shaking with his desire.\\n\\n Lord, she was the most incredibly giving woman he\u0027d ever touched. There was always such honesty in her reactions, such trust. That worried him. She didn\u0027t hold anything back, that sweet temptress of his, and when he finally settled himself between her silky thighs she was wet and hot and begging him to come to her.\\n\\n He wanted to take it slow and easy, to make each thrust last forever, but she made him forget his good intentions by squeezing him tightly inside her. The sting of her nails drove him wild, and the erotic little whimpers she made soon forced him to let go of his own control.\\n\\n He spilled his seed into her at the moment she found her own release. He held her close, absorbing her shudders with his own.\\n\\n The scent of their lovemaking clung to the air between them. The feeling of peace was there, too.\\n\\n He tried to roll away from her. She wouldn\u0027t let him. Her arms were tightly wrapped around his waist. The restraint was puny, but he decided to stay for a few more minutes, until she\u0027d calmed down just a little. Her heartbeat still sounded like a drumbeat, as did his own.\\n\\n He could feel the wetness on his shoulder, knew she\u0027d cried again. That amused him. Sara always ended up crying when she found her own release. She always screamed, too. His name. She\u0027d excused her behavior by telling him they were tears of joy she wept because she\u0027d never experienced such bliss. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-gift-crown-s-spies-3/page-21.html","bookId":1790,"book":{"id":1790,"title":"The Gift (Crown\u0027s Spies #3)","description":"Storyline: A child bride, Sara Winchester had grown into a winsome beauty, joyfully anticipating the day when her husband Nathan, Marquess of St. James, would return to claim her heart at last.
