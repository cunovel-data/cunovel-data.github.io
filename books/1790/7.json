She was about to try again when he let out a piercing whistle. The moonlit area had been completely deserted until that moment. Within a blink of an eye she found herself completely surrounded by men.\\n\\n Nathan\u0027s loyal crew stared at Sara. They acted as though they\u0027d never seen a pretty woman before. He looked down at his bride to see how she was reacting to their stares of obvious adoration. Sara wasn\u0027t paying any attention to the men, though. She was occupied glaring up at him. Nathan almost smiled in reaction.\\n\\n He gave her a quick squeeze to get her to quit her show of insolence, then turned his attention to the old woman. \"Do you have any baggage?\"\\n\\n \"Do we, Sara?\" Nora asked.\\n\\n Sara tried to shove herself away from her anchor before answering. \"I told you I was a married woman,\" she muttered. \"Now unhand me.\"\\n\\n He didn\u0027t budge. She gave up. \"Yes, Nora, we do have baggage. I borrowed some of my mother\u0027s things for you to wear. I\u0027m certain she won\u0027t mind. Nicholas stored the bags at the Marshall storefront. Shall we go and claim them?\"\\n\\n She tried to take a step forward and found herself hauled up against the giant again.\\n\\n Nathan found his man Jimbo in the back of the crowd and motioned to him. A tall, dark-skinned man walked over to stand in front of Sara. Her eyes widened at the sight of the near-giant. She stared at him a long minute, then came to the conclusion that he might have been attractive if it weren\u0027t for the odd-looking gold earring looped through his ear.\\n\\n He must have felt her stare on him, for he suddenly turned his full attention on her. He folded his massive arms across his chest and gave her a good scowl.\\n\\n She scowled back.\\n\\n A sudden sparkle appeared in his midnight-dark eyes, and he gifted her with a full smile. She didn\u0027t know what to make of that strange behavior.\\n\\n \"Have two men see to the baggage, Jimbo,\" Nathan ordered. \"We\u0027ll board the Seahawk at first light.\"\\n\\n Sara couldn\u0027t help but notice that the Viking had included himself in her plans.\\n\\n \"My aunt and I will be perfectly safe now,\" she said. \"These men seem to be… pleasant enough, sir. We\u0027ve wasted enough of your valuable time.\"\\n\\n Nathan continued to ignore her. He motioned to another man. When a thick-muscled though squat-framed older man came forward, Nathan nodded toward Nora. \"Take care of the old woman, Matthew.\"\\n\\n Nora let out a gasp. Sara thought it was because they were about to be separated from each other. Yet before she could argue with their unwanted protector Nora straightened her shoulders and slowly walked over to the enormous man.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not an old woman, sir, and I take grave exception to such an insult. I\u0027m only one year past fifty, young man, and feeling as spry as can be.\"\\n\\n Nathan\u0027s eyebrow rose a fraction, but he kept his smile contained. A strong gust of wind would topple the old woman, so frail did she appear to him to be, yet she had the tone of voice of a commander.\\n\\n \"You should apologize to my aunt,\" Sara said.\\n\\n She turned back to her aunt before he had time to react to that statement. \"I\u0027m certain he didn\u0027t mean to hurt your feelings, Nora. He\u0027s just rude.\"\\n\\n Nathan shook his head. The conversation was ridiculous to him. \"Matthew, move,\" he ordered in a clipped voice.\\n\\n Nora turned to the man hovering by her side. \"And just where do you think you\u0027re taking me?\"\\n\\n In answer, Matthew lifted Nora into his arms.\\n\\n \"Put me down, you rascal.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s all right, lovey,\" Matthew replied. \"You look a might peaked to me. You don\u0027t weigh more than a feather.\"\\n\\n Nora was about to protest again. His next question changed her mind. \"Where did you get those bruises? Give me the name of the bloody infidel, and I\u0027ll be happy to cut his throat for you.\"\\n\\n Nora smiled at the man holding her. She judged his age to be near her own and had also noticed what a fit man he appeared to be. She hadn\u0027t blushed in years, yet she knew from the sudden heat in her cheeks that she was certainly blushing at that moment. \"Thank you, sir,\" she stammered out as she patted the bun back into place on top of her head. \"That is certainly a kind offer.\"\\n\\n Sara was astonished by her aunt\u0027s behavior. Why, she was I fluttering her eyelashes and acting very like a flirt at her first I ball! She watched the pair until they were out of sight, then | noticed that the crowd of men had also vanished. She was suddenly all alone with her contrary savior.\\n\\n \"Is my Aunt Nora going to be safe with that man?\" she demanded to know.\\n\\n His answer was a low growl of obvious irritation. \"Does one grunt mean yes or no?\" she asked.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" he answered with a sigh when she poked him in his ribs.\\n\\n \"Please let me go.\"\\n\\n He actually did as she asked. Sara was so surprised she nearly lost her balance. Perhaps, she decided, if she could maintain her pleasant tone of voice, she could get him to obey other commands. It was certainly worth a try.\\n\\n \"Am I going to be safe with you?\"\\n\\n He took his sweet time answering her. Sara turned until she was standing face-to-shoulders in front of him. The tips of her shoes touched the tips of his boots. \"Please answer me,\" she whispered in a sweet, coaxing tone of voice.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t seem to be impressed with her attempt to have a pleasant conversation. His exasperation, on the other hand, was evident. \"Yes, Sara. You\u0027ll always be safe with me.\"\\n\\n \"But I don\u0027t want to be safe with you,\" she cried out. She realized how foolish that statement sounded as soon as the words were out of her mouth, and she hastily tried to correct herself. \"What I mean to say is that I do always want to be safe. Everyone wants to be safe. Even villains…\"\\n\\n She stopped rambling when he grinned at her. \"I want to be safe without you. You aren\u0027t planning to sail with Nora and me, are you? Why are you staring at me like that?\"\\n\\n He answered her first question and ignored her second one. \"Yes, I\u0027m sailing with you.\"\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"I want to,\" he drawled. He decided to wait a little longer before giving her the particulars. Her cheeks were flushed again. Nathan couldn\u0027t decide if the cause was fear or temper.\\n\\n His bride still had freckles on the bridge of her nose. He was pleased by that fact. It made him remember the little hellion he\u0027d held in his arms. She wasn\u0027t a little girl any longer, though. She\u0027d grown up quite nicely, too. She was, however, obviously still a bit of a hellion.\\n\\n She actually nudged him in his chest to gain his attention again. \"I\u0027m sorry, sir, but you simply cannot travel with Nora and me,\" she announced. \"You\u0027re going to have to find another boat. It wouldn\u0027t be safe for you to be on the same vessel with me.\"\\n\\n That strange statement gained his full attention. \"Oh? And why is that?\"\\n\\n \"Because my husband won\u0027t like it,\" she announced. She nodded when he looked incredulous, then continued. \"Have you heard of the marquess of St. James? Oh, of course you have. Everyone knows about the Marquess. He\u0027s my husband, Viking, and he\u0027s going to pitch a fit when he finds out I\u0027m traveling with a… protector. No, I\u0027m afraid it won\u0027t do. Why are you smiling?\"\\n\\n \"Why did you call me Viking?\" he asked.\\n\\n She shrugged her shoulders. \"Because you look like one.\"\\n\\n \"Should I call you shrew?\"\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re acting like one.\"\\n\\n She felt like screaming in frustration. \"Who are you? What do you want with me?\"\\n\\n \"You still owe me, Sara.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, Lord, are you going to harp on that issue again?\"\\n\\n His slow nod infuriated her. He was thoroughly enjoying himself. When Sara realized that fact her bluster of indignation evaporated. She knew then that she was never going to get him to make sense. The man was daft. The sooner she got away from this barbarian, she thought, the better. First, however, she would have to find a way to placate him.\\n\\n \"All right,\" she agreed. \"I owe you. There, we are in complete agreement. Now then, please tell me exactly what it is you think I owe you, and I shall endeavor to make payment.\"\\n\\n He moved forward so that he could catch her in the event she fainted on him again before he gave her an answer. \"My name\u0027s Nathan, Sara.\"\\n\\n \"And?\" she asked, wondering why he\u0027d suddenly decided to tell her his name.\\n\\n She was slow to catch on. His sigh was long, weary. \"And you, Lady St. James, owe me a wedding night.\"\\n\\n Chapter Three\\n\\n She didn\u0027t faint; she screamed. Nathan didn\u0027t try to quiet her down. When he couldn\u0027t stand the grating noise another second he simply dragged her over to the Emerald Shipping Company offices. He left the hysterical woman in her aunt\u0027s capable hands. Because he believed he was capable of gentlemanly behavior upon rare occasion, he didn\u0027t start laughing until he was once again outside.\\n\\n Nathan had thoroughly enjoyed her reaction to his announcement. Lady Sara wasn\u0027t at all subtle. He doubted he would ever have to worry about knowing what was on her mind. Nathan, conditioned to sneakiness all his life, found his straightforward bride refreshing. Loud, he added as an afterthought, but refreshing all the same.\\n\\n After he took care of a few remaining details Nathan joined the last of the crew aboard the ship. Jimbo and Matthew were waiting on deck for him. They were both scowling, but Nathan decided to let them get away with their show of insolence. He had saddled the loyal men with the chore of getting Sara and Nora settled in their cabins.\\n\\n \"Did she finally quit screaming?\" Nathan asked.\\n\\n \"When I threatened to put a gag in her mouth,\" Jimbo answered. The big man increased his frown and added, \"She hit me then.\"\\n\\n Nathan let his exasperation show. \"I assume she isn\u0027t too frightened any longer,\" he replied dryly.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not so certain she ever was frightened,\" Matthew interjected. The older man grinned. \"Didn\u0027t you notice the fire in her eyes when you dragged her into the offices? She looked bloody furious to me.\"\\n\\n Jimbo reluctantly nodded. \"After you left she kept shouting that it was all just a cruel jest. Not even her sweet-tempered aunt could calm her down. Your lady actually demanded that someone pinch her so she\u0027d wake up and find it was all just a black nightmare.\"\\n\\n \"Aye, she did,\" Matthew agreed with a chuckle. \"Felix took her to heart, too. For all his bulk, the boy isn\u0027t very cunning.\"\\n\\n \"Felix touched her?\" Nathan was more incredulous than angry.\\n\\n \"No, he didn\u0027t touch her,\" Jimbo rushed out. \"He tried to give her a little pinch, that\u0027s all. He thought he was being accommodating. You know how the boy likes to please. Your little bride turned into a wildcat as soon as he went for her. I wager Felix won\u0027t be so eager to obey next time she gives an order.\"\\n\\n Nathan shook his head in vexation. He started to turn away. Matthew stopped him with his next remark. \"Perhaps Lady Sara will do better if we put her in with her aunt.\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n Nathan realized how abrupt he\u0027d sounded when both men smiled at him. \"She stays in my cabin,\" he added in a much softer tone of voice.\\n\\n Matthew paused to rub his chin. \"Well now, boy, that could be a problem,\" he drawled. \"She doesn\u0027t know it\u0027s your cabin.\"\\n\\n Nathan wasn\u0027t at all concerned about that announcement. He frowned at Matthew, but only because the seaman had used the ridiculous nickname \"boy\" when he\u0027d addressed him. Nathan knew his unspoken censure wouldn\u0027t do him any good, though. Both Matthew and Jimbo called him that insulting nickname whenever they were alone with him. They didn\u0027t think he was seasoned enough to merit the name \"captain\" in private. Nathan had inherited the pair when he\u0027d taken over the vessel. The two men had quickly proven to be invaluable. They knew all the ins and outs of pirating and had shown him the way. He knew they thought of themselves as his guardians. God only knew they\u0027d told him so often enough. Still, they\u0027d put their lives on the line countless times in the past to save his backside. Their loyalty far outweighed their irritating habits.\\n\\n Since the two men were staring at him with such expectant looks on their faces, Nathan said, \"She\u0027ll find out soon enough whose cabin she\u0027s in.\"\\n\\n \"The aunt is in a poor way,\" Matthew said then. \"I\u0027d wager a couple of her ribs are cracked. As soon as she falls asleep I\u0027m going to strip her raw and bind her tight around the middle.\"\\n\\n \"The Winchesters did the damage, didn\u0027t they?\" Jimbo asked.\\n\\n Nathan nodded. \"Which bastard brother was it?\" Matthew asked that question.\\n\\n \"It appears that Henry was behind the scheme,\" Nathan explained. \"But I would imagine the other brothers were aware of what was going on.\"\\n\\n \"Are we going to take Nora home?\" Matthew asked.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re charted in that direction,\" Nathan answered. \"I don\u0027t know what the hell else to do with the woman. Is she strong enough to make the journey?\" he asked Matthew. \"Or are we going to have to bury her at sea?\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027ll do all right,\" Matthew predicted. \"There\u0027s a tough hide underneath all those bruises. Yes, if I coddle her real nice, she\u0027ll make it.\" He nudged Jimbo in his side, then added, \"Now I\u0027m having to nursemaid two weaklings.\"\\n\\n Nathan knew he was being baited. He turned and walked away. From behind Jimbo called out, \"He\u0027s referring to you, boy.\"\\n\\n Nathan raised his hand high into the air to make an obscene gesture before disappearing down the stairs. The men\u0027s hearty laughter followed him.\\n\\n The next several hours were spent on chores for every hand aboard the Seahawk. The cargo was secured, the jib raised, the anchor weighed, and the eight cannons given a last spit and oiling before the command was given to sail.\\n\\n Nathan did his part until his stomach became so queasy he was forced to stop. Jimbo took over command of the forty-two seamen when Nathan went below again.\\n\\n It was a ritual getting seasick the first couple of days out. Nathan had learned to put up with the inconvenience. He was certain no one besides Matthew and Jimbo were aware of his problem, but that fact didn\u0027t ease his embarrassment at all.\\n\\n From past experience he knew he had another hour or two before he was completely out of commission. Nathan decided to look in on his bride to make certain she was all right. If luck was on his side, she would be sound asleep, and the inevitable confrontation could be put off until later. God knew she should be exhausted. His bride had been awake for over twenty-four hours, and the tantrum she\u0027d thrown when she found out that he was indeed her husband surely had worn her out. Still, if she wasn\u0027t sleeping, Nathan determined to have it out with her and get it over and done with. The sooner the rules were set down for her, the sooner she could come to terms with his expectations for their future together. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-gift-crown-s-spies-3/page-7.html","bookId":1790,"book":{"id":1790,"title":"The Gift (Crown\u0027s Spies #3)","description":"Storyline: A child bride, Sara Winchester had grown into a winsome beauty, joyfully anticipating the day when her husband Nathan, Marquess of St. James, would return to claim her heart at last.
