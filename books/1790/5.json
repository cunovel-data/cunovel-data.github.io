{"id":78536,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"\"Henry took my wedding band,\" Nora explained. She shook her head again. The silvery cluster of hair at the top of her head immediately sagged to one side. \"I won\u0027t leave England without it. My Johnny, God rest his soul, gave me orders never to take it off the day we were wed fourteen years ago. I can\u0027t go home without my wedding band, Sara. It\u0027s too precious to me.\"\n \"Yes, we must find it,\" Sara agreed when her aunt started to weep again. She was alarmed by the wheeze in her aunt\u0027s voice, too. The dear woman was obviously having difficulty catching her breath. \"Do you have any idea where Uncle Henry might have hidden it?\"\n \"That\u0027s the true blasphemy,\" Nora answered. She leaned against the banister in an effort to ease the ache in her chest, then said, \"Henry didn\u0027t bother to hide it. He\u0027s wearing it on his little finger. Sporting it like a trophy, he is. Now, if we could determine where your uncle is drinking tonight, we could fetch the band back.\"\n Sara nodded. Her stomach started aching at the thought of what she was going to have to do. \"I know where he is,\" she said. \"Nicholas has been following him. Now, are you up to a short walk to the corner of the block? I didn\u0027t dare order the hack to wait out front for fear Uncle Henry would come home early.\"\n \"Of course I\u0027m up to a walk,\" Nora answered. She moved away from the banister. Her gait was stiff as she slowly made her way to the door. \"Heavens,\" she whispered. \"If your mother could see me now, she\u0027d die of shame. I\u0027m about to take a walk in the dead of night dressed in my nightgown and a borrowed cloak.\"\n Sara smiled. \"We aren\u0027t going to tell my mother, though, are we?\" She let out a gasp when she saw her aunt grimace. \"You\u0027re in terrible pain, aren\u0027t you?\"\n \"Nonsense,\" Nora scoffed. \"I\u0027m already feeling much better. Come along now,\" she ordered in a brisker tone. \"We mustn\u0027t linger here, child.\" She clutched the rail and started down the steps. \"It will take more than a Winchester to do me in.\"\n Sara started to pull the door shut behind her, then changed her mind. \"I believe I shall leave this door wide open in the hope that someone will come along and help himself to Uncle Henry\u0027s possessions. I dare not get my hopes up, though,\" she added. \"There don\u0027t seem to be any villains on the streets tonight. On my walk over here I saw nary a one.\"\n \"Good Lord, Sara, you actually walked over here?\" Aunt Nora asked, clearly appalled.\n \"I did,\" Sara answered. There was a hint of a boast in her voice. \"I kept my guard up, of course, so you can quit your frown. I didn\u0027t have to use my parasol once to fend off anyone with ill intentions, either. Oh, heavens, I\u0027ve left my lovely parasol in the window.\"\n \"Leave it be,\" her aunt ordered when Sara started back up the steps. \"We\u0027re pressing our luck against the devil if we stay here much longer. Now give me your arm, dear. I\u0027ll hold onto you while we make this short walk. You really walked over here, Sara?\"\n Sara laughed. \"To tell you the full truth, I do believe I ran most of the way. I was very frightened, Nora, but I made the journey without mishap. Do you know, I believe all this talk about our streets being so unsafe is just exaggeration.\"\n The two ladies strolled arm in arm down the dark, narrow street, Sara\u0027s laughter trailing behind them. The hack was waiting for them at the corner. Sara was assisting her aunt inside the black vehicle when a hopeful assailant came rushing toward them. Nathan intervened by simply moving forward into the moonlight. The man took one look at him, did a hasty turnaround, and blended back into the shadows again.\n Nathan thought the old woman might have gotten a look at him. She had glanced back over her shoulder just when he\u0027d moved forward, but he decided her eyesight must have dimmed with age when she turned around again without shouting a warning to her niece.\n Sara certainly hadn\u0027t noticed his presence. She had a heated discussion over the fare with the driver, finally agreed to his exorbitant fee, and then joined her aunt inside the vehicle. The hack was in motion when Nathan grabbed hold of the back rail and swung himself up on the ledge. The vehicle rocked from the added weight before picking up speed again.\n Sara was certainly making her own kidnapping easy work. Nathan had heard her tell her aunt that they would be leaving London by ship. He therefore assumed their destination was the wharf. Then the hack veered off onto one of the side streets near the waterfront and came to an abrupt stop in front of one of the most notorious taverns in the city.\n She was going after the damn wedding band, he supposed with a growl of irritation. Nathan jumped down from the ledge and moved into the light further behind the hack. He wanted the men loitering in front of the tavern to get a good look at him. He braced his legs apart for a fight, moved his right hand to the hilt of the coiled whip hooked to his belt, and scowled at the sizable group.\n They noticed him. Three of the smaller ones edged their way back inside. The other four leaned back against the stone wall. Their gazes were directed on the ground.\n The driver climbed down from his perch, received fresh instructions, and hurried inside. He came back outside a scant minute later, muttered that he\u0027d best be getting a giant bonus for all the trouble he\u0027d had to endure, and then climbed back up to his seat.\n Another few minutes elapsed before the door of the tavern opened again. A sour-faced man with a grossly distended belly came outside. He was dressed in rumpled, soiled clothing that was ripe from wear. The stranger slicked his greasy hair back from his brow in a pitiful attempt at grooming as he swaggered over to the carriage.\n \"My employer, Henry Winchester, is too sotted to come outside,\" he announced. \"We come to this part of town when we don\u0027t want to be noticed,\" he added. \"I\u0027m here in his stead, m\u0027lady. Your driver said there be a woman in need of something, and I\u0027m thinking I\u0027m just the man you\u0027re needing.\"\n The disgusting man scratched his groin while he eagerly waited for a reply to his offer.\n The stench radiating from the foul-smelling man came in through the window. Sara almost gagged in reaction. She placed her perfumed hankerchief over her nose, turned to her aunt, and whispered, \"Do you know this man?\"\n \"I most certainly do,\" her aunt answered. \"His name\u0027s Clifford Duggan, Sara, and he\u0027s the one who helped your uncle waylay me.\"\n \"Did he strike you?\"\n \"Yes, dear, he did,\" Nora answered. \"Several times, as a matter of fact.\"\n The servant under discussion couldn\u0027t see inside the dark carriage. He leaned forward to get a better look at his prize.\n Nathan walked over to the side of the carriage. His intent was to tear the man from aft to stern for daring to leer at his bride. He stopped when he saw the white-gloved fist fly through the open window and connect quite soundly with the side of the man\u0027s bulbous nose.\n Clifford hadn\u0027t been prepared for the attack. He let out a howl of pain, staggered backwards, and tripped over his own feet. He landed with a thud on his knees. While he spewed one crude blasphemy after another he diligently tried to regain his feet.\n Sara pressed her advantage. She threw the carriage door open, catching the villain in his midsection. The servant did a near somersault before landing in the gutter on his backside.\n The men lounging against the wall hooted in appreciation of the spectacle they\u0027d just witnessed. Sara ignored her audience as she climbed out of the carriage. She turned to hand her reticule to her aunt, took another minute to remove her gloves and pass those through the window to her aunt, too, and then finally gave her full attention to the man sprawled on the ground.\n She was simply too infuriated to be afraid. She stood over her victim looking very like an avenging angel. Her voice shook with fury when she said, \"If you ever mistreat a lady again, Clifford Duggan, I swear to God you\u0027ll die a slow, agonizing death.\"\n \"I ain\u0027t never mistreated a lady,\" Clifford whined. He was trying to catch his breath so he could pounce on her. \"How would you be knowing my name?\"\n Nora leaned out the window. \"You\u0027re a shameful liar, Clifford,\" she called out. \"You\u0027re going to burn in hell for all your sins.\"\n Clifford\u0027s eyes widened in astonishment. \"How did you get out—\"\n Sara interrupted his question by giving him a sound kick. He turned his gaze back to her. His expression was insolent. \"You think you got the meat to hurt me?\" he sneered. He glanced back at the men leaning against the wall. In truth, the servant was more humiliated than injured by her paltry attack. The snickers echoing behind him stung far more than her little slap. \"The only reason I ain\u0027t retaliating is because my employer will want to beat you good and sound afore he lets me have you.\"\n \"Do you have any idea how much trouble you\u0027re in, Clifford?\" Sara asked. \"My husband is going to hear about this atrocity, and he will certainly retaliate. The marquess of St. James is feared by everyone, even ignorant pigs like you, Clifford. When I tell him what you\u0027ve been up to he\u0027ll give you equal measure. The marquess does whatever I tell him to do just like that.\" She paused to snap her fingers for effect. \"Oh, I can see I\u0027ve gotten your full attention with that promise,\" she added with a nod when Clifford\u0027s expression changed. The man looked downright terrified. He had quit trying to regain his feet and was actually scooting backward on his backside.\n Sara was inordinately pleased with herself. Her bluff had worked quite well. She didn\u0027t realize that Clifford had just gotten a good look at the giant standing a scant ten feet behind her. She thought she\u0027d just put the fear of a St. James into the servant. \"A man who strikes a lady is a true coward,\" she announced. \"My husband kills cowards as easily as he would a bothersome gnat, and if you doubt me, just remember he is a St. James through and through.\"\n \"Sara, dear,\" Nora called out. \"Would you like me to accompany you inside?\"\n Sara didn\u0027t take her gaze off Clifford when she gave her aunt answer. \"No, Nora. You aren\u0027t dressed for the occasion. I won\u0027t be long.\"\n \"Hurry, then,\" Nora called out. \"You\u0027ll catch a chill, dear.\"\n Nora continued to lean out the window, but her gaze was directed at Nathan. He returned her wide-eyed stare with a brisk nod before turning his attention back to his bride.\n Nora was quick to notice how the big man was keeping the hounds at bay. His mere size was intimidating. It didn\u0027t take her any time at all to realize he was actually providing safety for Sara. Nora thought about calling a warning to her niece, then discounted the notion. Sara had enough to worry about. Nora would wait to mention the savior when she was finished with her important errand.\n Nathan kept his attention on Sara. His bride was certainly full of surprises. He was having difficulty coming to terms with that fact. He\u0027d seen what cowards the Winchesters were. The men in the family always did their dirty work under cover of darkness, or when a man\u0027s back was turned. Sara, however, wasn\u0027t acting at all like a Winchester. She was courageous in her defense of the old woman. And Lord, was she in a fury. He didn\u0027t think he would have been surprised if she\u0027d pulled out a pistol and shot her victim between his eyes. She was definitely angry enough.\n Sara skirted the servant, paused to give him a good glare, and then hurried on inside the tavern.\n Nathan immediately walked over to Clifford. He grabbed him by his neck, lifted him high into the air, and then flung him against the stone wall.\n His audience scattered like mice to avoid being hit. Clifford struck the wall with a loud splat, then crumpled to the ground in a dead faint.\n \"My good man?\" Nora called out. \"I do believe you\u0027d better go inside now. My Sara\u0027s bound to need your assistance yet again.\"\n Nathan turned to scowl at the woman who dared to issue him an order. Just then the whistles and hoots of laughter coming from inside the tavern gained his full attention. With a growl of frustration over what he considered a damned inconvenience he slowly uncoiled his whip and walked toward the door.\n Sara located her uncle who was hunched over his ale at a round table in the center of the establishment. She made her way through the throng of customers to get to him. She thought she would use shame and reason to get Aunt Nora\u0027s ring back. Yet when she actually saw the silver band on his finger her mind emptied of all reasonable ploys. There was a full pitcher of dark ale on the table. Before Sara could contain herself she lifted the pitcher and emptied the contents over her uncle\u0027s balding head.\n He was too far gone from drink to react swiftly. He let out a loud bellow, interrupted himself with a rank belch, and then staggered to his feet. Sara had worked the wedding band off his finger before his mind had cleared sufficiently to ward her off.\n It took him a long while to focus on her properly. Sara slipped the ring on her own finger while she waited.\n \"My God… Sara? What are you doing here? Is something amiss?\" Uncle Henry stammered out his questions in a bluster. The effort cost him what little strength he had left. He slumped back down in his chair and squinted up at her with bloodshot eyes. Henry noticed the empty pitcher. \"Where\u0027s my ale?\" he shouted to the barkeep.\n Sara was thoroughly disgusted with her uncle. Even though she doubted he\u0027d remember a single word of her lecture, she was determined to let him know what she thought about his sinful conduct.\n \"Is something amiss?\" She repeated his question in a derisive tone. \"You are despicable, Uncle Henry. If my father knew what you and his other brothers were doing to Nora, I\u0027m certain he\u0027d call the authorities and have you all carted off to the gallows.\"\n \"What say you?\" Henry asked. He rubbed his forehead while he tried to concentrate on the conversation. \"Nora? You\u0027re ranting at me because of that worthless woman?\"\n Before Sara could chastise him for making that shameful remark he blurted out, \"Your father was in on the plan from the very beginning. Nora\u0027s too old to take care of herself. We know what\u0027s best for her. Don\u0027t try throwing a tantrum with me, girl, for I\u0027m not going to tell you where she is.\"\n \"You do not know what\u0027s best for her,\" Sara shouted. \"You wanted her inheritance, and that\u0027s the real reason. Everyone in London knows about your gaming debts, Uncle. You found an easy way to pay them off, didn\u0027t you? You were set to lock Nora away in an asylum, weren\u0027t you?\"\n Henry\u0027s gaze darted back and forth between the empty pitcher and his niece\u0027s outraged expression. It finally dawned on him that she had poured his ale over his head. He touched his collar just to be sure, and when he felt the sticky wetness there he became livid. His own anger made his head start pounding. He was in desperate need of another drink. \"We are going to put the bitch away, and you can\u0027t do anything about it. Now get on home before I put my hand to your backside.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-gift-crown-s-spies-3/page-5.html","bookId":1790,"book":{"id":1790,"title":"The Gift (Crown\u0027s Spies #3)","description":"Storyline: \n A child bride, Sara Winchester had grown into a winsome beauty, joyfully anticipating the day when her husband Nathan, Marquess of St. James, would return to claim her heart at last.
