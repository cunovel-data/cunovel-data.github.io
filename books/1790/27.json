{"id":78558,"no":27,"title":"Page 27","content":"\"The hell I will,\" he muttered. Another black thought gave him the chills. \"You didn\u0027t make anything when you were in the galley, did you? You didn\u0027t eat something you prepared?\"\n \"No. It isn\u0027t stomach upset.\"\n \"Then what the hell is it?\"\n \"I\u0027m not… clean.\"\n He didn\u0027t know what in God\u0027s name that was supposed to mean. \"You\u0027re sick because you aren\u0027t clean? Sara, that\u0027s got to be the most illogical illness I\u0027ve ever heard of. Will you feel better if I order a bath made ready for you?\"\n She wanted to scream at him yet knew the effort would cost her more pain. \"Nathan, it\u0027s a… woman\u0027s condition,\" she whispered.\n \"A what?\"\n Lord, he was going to make her spell it out for him. \"I\u0027m having my monthly,\" she shouted. \"Oh, I hurt,\" she added in a whimper. \"Some months are worse than others.\"\n \"You\u0027re having your monthly…\"\n \"I\u0027m not pregnant,\" she blurted out at the same moment. \"Please go away now. If God is truly merciful, I\u0027ll die in just a few more minutes… if not from the pain, then from the shame of having to explain my condition to you.\"\n He was so relieved she wasn\u0027t suffering from a life-threatening ailment, he let out a ragged sigh. Then he reached out to pat her shoulder. He pulled back before actually touching her, though. Damn, he felt awkward. Inadequate, too.\n \"Is there anything I can do to ease your pain?\" he asked. \"Do you want something?\"\n \"I want my mother,\" she muttered. \"But I can\u0027t have her, can I? Oh, just go away, Nathan. There isn\u0027t anything you can do.\"\n She pulled the covers back over her face and let out another pitiful moan. Nathan must have decided to let her have her way, she decided when she heard the door shut. She burst into tears then. How dare he leave her when she was in such agony? She\u0027d lied when she said she wanted her mother. She wanted Nathan to hold her, and the obstinate man should have been able to read her mind and know that was what she needed.\n Nathan immediately went to Nora\u0027s cabin. He didn\u0027t bother to knock. As soon as he threw the door open a deep voice called out, \"Who\u0027s there?\"\n Nathan almost smiled. He recognized Matthew\u0027s booming voice. The seaman was obviously sharing Nora\u0027s bed. \"I have to talk to Nora,\" he announced.\n Sara\u0027s aunt came awake with a start. She let out a gasp and pulled the covers up to her chin. Her blush was as high as the candle flame.\n Nathan walked over to the side of the bed and stood there with his hands clasped behind his back, staring at the floor.\n \"Sara\u0027s ill,\" he announced before Nora could say a word.\n Nora\u0027s embarrassment over being found in such a compromising position quickly faded in the light of that announcement.\n \"I must go to her,\" she whispered. She struggled to sit up. \"Do you know what the ailment is?\"\n \"Do you want me to have a look at her?\" Matthew asked in a rush. He was already tossing the covers aside.\n Nathan shook his head. He cleared his throat. \"It\u0027s this… woman\u0027s thing.\"\n \"What woman\u0027s thing?\" Matthew asked, genuinely perplexed.\n Nora understood. She patted Matthew\u0027s hand but kept her gaze on Nathan\u0027s face. \"Is she in much pain?\"\n Nathan nodded. \"She\u0027s in terrible pain, madam. Now tell me what I can do to help her.\"\n Nora thought he sounded very like a military commander, so brisk was his tone of voice. \"A stiff drink of brandy sometimes helps,\" Nora suggested. \"A gentle word wouldn\u0027t hurt either, Nathan. I remember becoming very emotional during that time of month.\"\n \"Isn\u0027t there anything else I can do for her?\" Nathan muttered. \"My God, Nora, she\u0027s in pain. I won\u0027t have it\"\n With extreme effort Nora was able to contain her smile. Nathan looked like he wanted to kill someone. \"Have you asked her what might help?\"\n \"She wanted her mother.\"\n \"How would that help?\" Matthew asked.\n Nora answered, \"She needs her husband, dear. Nathan, she wants someone to comfort her. Try rubbing her back.\"\n Nora had to raise her voice to give that last suggestion, for Nathan was already striding out the doorway.\n As soon as the door closed behind him Nora turned to Matthew. \"Do you think he\u0027ll tell Sara that you and I—\"\n \"No, my love, he wouldn\u0027t say a word,\" Matthew interjected.\n \"I hate to deceive Sara, but she does tend to see everything in black or white. I don\u0027t think she\u0027d understand.\"\n \"Hush now,\" Matthew soothed. He kissed Nora and pulled her into his arms. \"Age will season her.\"\n Nora agreed. She changed the topic then and whispered, \"Nathan is beginning to care for Sara, isn\u0027t he? It won\u0027t be long before he realizes he loves her.\"\n \"He may love her, Nora, but he won\u0027t ever admit it. The boy learned a long time ago to protect himself against any true involvement.\"\n Nora snorted over that remark. \"Nonsense,\" she countered. \"Given an ordinary woman, perhaps you would be right, Matthew, but surely you\u0027ve noticed by now that my Sara isn\u0027t ordinary. She\u0027s just what Nathan needs. She thinks her husband loves her, and it won\u0027t take her long to convince him that he does. Just wait and see.\"\n Sara didn\u0027t have any idea she was the topic of discussion. She was in the throes of self-pity.\n She never heard Nathan come back into the cabin. He was suddenly touching her shoulder. \"Sara, drink this. It will make you feel better.\"\n She rolled over, saw the goblet in his hands, and immediately shook her head.\n \"It\u0027s brandy,\" he told her.\n \"I don\u0027t want it.\"\n \"Drink it.\"\n \"I\u0027ll throw up.\"\n She couldn\u0027t be any blunter than that, he supposed. He hastily put the goblet on the desk and then got into bed beside her.\n She tried to push him out. He ignored her struggle and her demands.\n Sara rolled back onto her side again, facing the wall. She might as well pray for death, she supposed. It was an overly dramatic request she gave her Maker, and in the back of her mind she really hoped He wasn\u0027t listening, and that thought didn\u0027t make a lick of sense to her either.\n She couldn\u0027t take the pain much longer. Then Nathan put his arm around her waist. He pulled her a little closer to him and began to rub her lower back. The gentle touch was heaven. The ache immediately began to lessen. Sara closed her eyes and scooted closer to her husband so that she could steal a little more of his warmth.\n She barely noticed the rocking and pitching motion of the ship. Nathan noticed. His own stomach was in torment, and he wished to God he hadn\u0027t eaten anything. It was only a matter of time before he would turn completely green.\n He kept rubbing her spine for fifteen minutes or so without speaking a word to her. He tried to concentrate on the woman cuddled up against him, but each time the ship rolled, so did his stomach.\n \"You can stop now,\" Sara whispered. \"I\u0027m feeling better, thank you.\"\n Nathan did as she requested, then started to get out of bed. She waylaid that intent with her next request. \"Will you hold me, Nathan? I\u0027m so cold. It\u0027s chilly tonight, isn\u0027t it?\"\n It was as hot as blazes to him. His face was drenched in perspiration. He did as she asked, though. Her hands felt like ice, but in just a few minutes he\u0027d hugged her warm again.\n He thought she was finally asleep and was just easing himself out of her hold when she whispered, \"Nathan? What if I\u0027m barren?\"\n \"Then you\u0027re barren.\"\n \"Is that all you can say? We can\u0027t have children if I\u0027m barren.\"\n He rolled his eyes heavenward. God, she sounded like she was going to cry again. \"You can\u0027t possibly know if you\u0027re barren or not,\" he said. \"It\u0027s too soon to jump to that conclusion.\"\n \"But if I am?\" she prodded.\n \"Sara, what do you want me to say?\" he asked. His frustration was almost visible. His stomach lurched again. Deep breaths weren\u0027t helping. He tossed the covers aside and tried to leave the bed again.\n \"Would you still want to be married to me?\" she asked. \"We won\u0027t get the land the king promised if I don\u0027t have a baby by the time—\"\n \"I\u0027m aware of the conditions of the contract,\" he snapped. \"If we don\u0027t get the land, then we\u0027ll rebuild on the land my father left to me. Now quit your questions and go to sleep. I\u0027ll be back in a little while.\"\n \"You still haven\u0027t answered me,\" she said. \"Would you still want to be married to a barren woman?\"\n \"Oh, for God\u0027s sake—\"\n \"You would, wouldn\u0027t you?\"\n He grunted. She took that sound to mean he would. She rolled over and kissed his back. He\u0027d left the candles burning, and when she looked up at his face she saw how gray his complexion had turned.\n She was quick to put two and two together. The ship was bouncing like an errant ball in the water. The goblet of brandy was pitched to the floor. Nathan closed his eyes and grimaced.\n He was seasick. Sara was filled with sympathy for her poor husband, but that emotion was quickly squelched when he muttered, \"I wouldn\u0027t be married to anyone if it wasn\u0027t for the damned contracts. Now go to sleep.\"\n After grumbling out that remark he swung his legs over the side of the bed.\n Sara was suddenly furious again. How dare he take that tone of voice with her? She was just as ill as he was, perhaps even more. She forgot all about the gentle way he\u0027d treated her and decided to teach the man a lesson he wouldn\u0027t soon forget.\n \"I\u0027m sorry I\u0027m keeping you from whatever business you have to attend to,\" she began. \"My back is feeling much better now, Nathan. Thank you. My stomach isn\u0027t upset either. I suppose I shouldn\u0027t have had that fish for supper. It tasted wonderful, though, especially when I put a little dab of chocolate on top. Have you ever tasted fish sweetened that way? No?\" she asked when he didn\u0027t answer her.\n He seemed to be in quite a hurry to get his pants back on. Sara held her smile. \"I usually just put sugar on top, but I wanted to experiment tonight. By the way, the cook has promised to serve us oysters when we reach port. I love oysters, don\u0027t you? The way they sort of… slide down your throat… Nathan, aren\u0027t you going to kiss me good-bye?\"\n The door slammed shut before she\u0027d finished her question. Sara smiled. She gained tremendous satisfaction from her sinful actions. It was high time her husband realized his good fortune in having her for his wife. High time indeed.\n \"Serves him right for being so obstinate,\" she muttered to herself. She pulled the covers up over her shoulders and closed her eyes. She was sound asleep in minutes.\n Nathan spent most of the night hanging over the side of the ship. He\u0027d gone to the usually deserted area, and no one paid him any attention.\n The sun was easing up into the sky when he returned to the cabin. He felt as wrung out as a wet sail. He literally collapsed on the bed. Sara was bounced awake by that action. She rolled over and cuddled up against her husband\u0027s side.\n He started snoring so she wouldn\u0027t start talking again. Sara leaned up and kissed the side of his cheek. In the soft candlelight she could see how pale he was. He was in dire need of a shave, too. He looked fierce with the dark shadow along his jawline. Sara reached up to touch the side of his cheek with her fingertips. \"I love you,\" she whispered. \"Even with all your flaws, Nathan, I still love you. I\u0027m sorry I deliberately made you seasick. I\u0027m sorry that you suffer from such an ailment.\"\n Satisfied with her confession, especially because she knew he hadn\u0027t heard a word of what she\u0027d just said, she rolled away from him. Her sigh was loud. \"I do believe you should consider another line of work, husband. The sea doesn\u0027t seem to suit you.\"\n He slowly opened his eyes, then turned to look at her. She appeared to be asleep again. She looked damned peaceful to him. Angelic.\n He wanted to throttle her. His wife had somehow found out about his illness and had deliberately used that knowledge to get even with him. She must have taken exception to his remark about not being married at all if it weren\u0027t for the contracts.\n His flash of anger dissipated in little time, and he found himself smiling. Little Sara wasn\u0027t such an innocent after all She\u0027d done exactly what he would have done if he\u0027d had such a weapon at his disposal and wasn\u0027t strong enough to physically retaliate.\n When he was angry he liked to use his fists. She used her head and it pleased him. Still, it was high time she understood just who was in charge of the marriage. High time indeed. She wasn\u0027t supposed to use cunning on him.\n And Lord, she looked lovely. He suddenly wanted to make love to her. He couldn\u0027t, of course, because of her delicate condition, and he almost shook her awake to ask her how long this woman\u0027s thing lasted.\n Exhaustion finally overcame him. Just as he was drifting off to sleep he felt Sara take hold of his hand. He didn\u0027t pull away. His last thought before falling asleep was a bit unsettling.\n He needed her to hold him.\n They were just two days away from Nora\u0027s home, and Nathan was once again beginning to think that the rest of the voyage might prove uneventful.\n He should have known better.\n It was late evening on the twenty-first of the month. There were more stars than sky above, and the breeze was every bit as pretty by a seaman\u0027s measure. The wind was gentle, yet coaxingly insistent. They were making good time—a clipping speed, in fact. The mighty ship set straight in the water and cut directly through the ocean without rocking or lurching to either side. A man could put a keg of grog on the rail without fear of losing it, so calm was the sea, and there was nary a worry to annoy a seaman\u0027s dreams.\n Nathan stood next to Jimbo behind the wheel. The two men were in deep discussion over the plans to expand the Emerald Shipping Company. Jimbo was in favor of adding additional clippers to their fleet, while Nathan favored heavier, more durable ships.\n Sara interrupted their conversation when she came rushing across the deck. She was dressed only in her nightgown and wrapper. Jimbo noticed that right away. Nathan\u0027s back was to his wife, however, and because she was barefoot he didn\u0027t hear her approach.\n \"Nathan, I must speak to you at once,\" she cried out. \"We have a horrible problem, and you must take care of it right away.\"\n Nathan had a resigned look on his face when he turned around, but that expression faltered as soon as he saw the pistol in his wife\u0027s hand. The weapon, he couldn\u0027t help but notice, was pointed at his groin. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-gift-crown-s-spies-3/page-27.html","bookId":1790,"book":{"id":1790,"title":"The Gift (Crown\u0027s Spies #3)","description":"Storyline: \n A child bride, Sara Winchester had grown into a winsome beauty, joyfully anticipating the day when her husband Nathan, Marquess of St. James, would return to claim her heart at last.
