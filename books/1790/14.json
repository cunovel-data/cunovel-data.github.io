{"id":78545,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"\"So does she.\" He pinched her again. \"The St. James women aren\u0027t as fat as the Winchester women,\" he countered. \"The Winchester ladies are not fat,\" she argued. \"They\u0027re just… fit.\" It was high time they confronted the true issue here, she decided. She took a deep breath, then said, \"Nathan?\" \"Yes?\" \"I\u0027m not going to take my clothes off.\" That announcement got his full attention. \"You\u0027re not?\" She moved back a fraction of an inch so she could see his expression. His smile was slow, easy. It gave her courage to set down the rest of her rules. \"No, I\u0027m not,\" she said. \"If we must do this thing, I\u0027m keeping my clothes on. Take it or leave it, Nathan.\" She worried her lower lip while she waited for his reaction. Nathan thought she might be frightened again. That chafed him. \"For God\u0027s sake, Sara, I\u0027m not going to hurt you.\" \"Yes, you will,\" she whispered. \"And just how would you know?\" \"Mother said it always hurts.\" Sara\u0027s cheeks turned scarlet. \"It doesn\u0027t always hurt,\" he snapped. \"The first time might be a little… uncomfortable.\" \"You just contradicted yourself,\" she cried out. \"You don\u0027t have to act as though—\" \"I\u0027m not going to like it much either,\" she interrupted. \"You might as well understand that right this minute. How long does it take? Minutes or hours?\" she asked. \"I would like to try to prepare myself.\" He wasn\u0027t rubbing her backside now. He was gripping her. Hard. He looked a little startled by her question. Sara pushed her advantage. \"I have only one little favor to ask of you. Couldn\u0027t you please wait until tonight to do this thing? Since you\u0027re so determined, couldn\u0027t you at least give me a few more hours to come to terms with my fate?\" Come to terms with her fate? Nathan felt like throttling her. She acted as though she was going to an execution. Hers. He frowned even as he gave in. \"All right,\" he said. \"We\u0027ll wait until tonight, but that is the only favor I\u0027m willing to give you, Sara.\" She leaned up on tiptoes and kissed him. Her lips rubbed against him for just a fleeting instant, and when she moved back she was looking damned pleased with herself. \"What the hell was that supposed to be?\" \"A kiss.\" \"No, Sara,\" he growled. \"This is a kiss.\" He hauled her up against his chest, tilted her face up, and slammed his mouth down on hers. He wasn\u0027t at all gentle, but in truth she didn\u0027t mind at all. She melted against him and let him have his way. After all, she thought to herself, she\u0027d just gotten her victory, and she guessed he was entitled to one, too. Odd, but it was the last thought she could hold. The kiss became one of blatant ownership. The intensity, the raw intimacy made her weak in the knees. She clung to her husband and let out a little whimper of sheer bliss when his tongue moved inside her mouth. He squeezed her backside and lifted her up against his pelvis. Her h*ps instinctively cuddled his hardness. He pulled. She pushed. The feeling was erotic, arousing. Nathan quit trying to subdue her when he realized he had her full cooperation. Lord, she was responsive. She was tugging on his hair even as she tried to get closer to him. He pulled back quite suddenly, then had to hold her up until she recovered from the kiss. He was arrogantly happy over that telling fact. And damn, he wanted her. He pushed Sara down the bed and turned to leave. He had to move the chest and chair before he could get to the door. Sara had gathered her wits by the time he\u0027d gotten the door open. \"In future, Nathan,\" she began, grimacing over the shiver in her voice, \"I would really appreciate it if you wouldn\u0027t come into our chamber by way of the chimney. I promise I won\u0027t bolt the door again,\" she added when he turned around and gave her an incredulous look. \"Come in through what?\" he asked, thinking he surely hadn\u0027t heard her correctly. \"The chimney,\" she explained. \"And you still didn\u0027t answer my question. Is this thing you\u0027re so determined to do going to take minutes or hours?\" Her question turned his attention, and he was no longer interested in explaining that the trapdoor wasn\u0027t a chimney. He\u0027d explain that fact to the ignorant woman later. \"How the hell would I know how long it\u0027s going to take?\" he muttered. \"Do you mean you\u0027ve never done it before?\" Nathan closed his eyes. The conversation had gotten out of hand. \"Well, have you?\" \"Yes.\" He sounded disgusted. \"I\u0027ve just never timed it before,\" he snapped. He was pulling the door shut behind him when he suddenly turned back and smiled at her. She was amazed by the quick change in him. \"Sara?\" he asked. \"Yes?\" \"You aren\u0027t going to hate it.\" The door closed on that promise. Chapter Five Sara didn\u0027t see Nathan for the remainder of the day. She kept busy by righting the cabin and sorting through the rest of her possessions. Since she didn\u0027t have a lady\u0027s maid, she made the bed herself, dusted the furniture, and even borrowed a broom to sweep the dust from the floor. She remembered the parasol she\u0027d left up on the deck, but when she went to fetch it she couldn\u0027t find it anywhere. By sundown her nerves were at the breaking point. She hadn\u0027t been able to come up with any suitable plan to gain another reprieve. Sara was a little ashamed of her own cowardice. She knew that the bedding would have to happen sometime, knew that she would continue to dread it until it was over and done with, but those realizations didn\u0027t ease her fear. When the knock sounded at her door she almost screamed. She quickly regained her composure when she realized that Nathan certainly wouldn\u0027t knock. No, he\u0027d barge right in. The cabin belonged to him, after all, and she supposed he had the right to come in unannounced. Matthew was waiting outside her door. She curtsied to the seaman and invited him inside. He declined her offer with a shake of his head. \"Your Aunt Nora\u0027s waiting to have a visit with you now,\" he announced. \"While you\u0027re in her cabin I\u0027ll have Frost bring in the tub. The captain thought you might be wanting a bath, so he ordered us to bring fresh water. It\u0027s a treat you won\u0027t be getting too often,\" he added. \"You\u0027d best enjoy it.\" \"That was very thoughtful of Nathan,\" Sara returned. \"I\u0027ll be sure to tell him you thought so,\" Matthew replied for lack of anything better to say. He walked by Sara\u0027s side, feeling both awkward and ridiculously shy. He blamed his condition on the fact that he wasn\u0027t used to being treated like an equal except by Nathan. He\u0027d never had a lady curtsy to him either. There was also her enchanting smile, he admitted. His shoulders slumped forward a little. Lord, he was falling under the pretty\u0027s spell just like that ox Jimbo had. When they reached Nora\u0027s door Matthew forced himself out of his stupor and muttered, \"Don\u0027t you tire her out, all right?\" Sara nodded, then waited for Matthew to open the door for her. He was a bit slow to catch on until she motioned to show what she wanted. She thanked him after he\u0027d thrown the door wide, then walked inside. Matthew pulled the door closed behind her. \"Matthew had the most bewildered look on his face,\" Nora called out. \"I didn\u0027t notice,\" Sara admitted. She smiled at her aunt as she hurried over to the side of the bed to kiss her. Nora was propped up by a mound of fat pillows. \"I did notice what a worrier he is, though, and all on your behalf, Aunt,\" Sara announced. She pulled up a chair, sat down, and brushed the crinkles out of her gown. \"I believe he\u0027s become your champion.\" \"He\u0027s a handsome man, isn\u0027t he, Sara? He has a kind heart, too. His nature is very like my late husband\u0027s, though the two men are nothing alike in appearance.\" Sara held her smile. \"You\u0027re a little smitten with Matthew, aren\u0027t you, Nora?\" \"Nonsense, child. I\u0027m too old to be smitten.\" Sara let the subject go. \"Are you feeling better today?\" \"Yes, dear,\" Nora answered. \"And how are you feeling?\" \"Fine, thank you.\" Nora shook her head. \"You don\u0027t look fine to me,\" she announced. \"Sara, you\u0027re sitting on the edge of that chair, looking like you\u0027ll bolt at the first provocation. Is it Nathan worrying you?\" Sara slowly nodded. \"I was also worried about you, of course,\" she confessed. \"But now that I see you, I realize you\u0027re going to be fine.\" \"Don\u0027t change the topic,\" Nora ordered. \"I want to talk about Nathan.\" \"I don\u0027t.\" \"We\u0027re going to all the same,\" Nora countered. The cheer in her tone took the sting out of her remark. \"How are you and your husband getting along?\" Sara lifted her shoulders in a dainty shrug. \"As well as can be expected, given his disposition.\" Nora smiled. \"Has he kissed you yet?\" \"Nora, you shouldn\u0027t be asking me that question.\" \"Answer me. Has he?\" Sara looked at her lap when she answered. \"Yes, he did kiss me.\" \"Good.\" \"If you say so.\" \"Now, Sara, I know Nathan isn\u0027t exactly what you imagined he would be, but if you\u0027ll only look below the gruff exterior, I believe you\u0027ll find yourself a good man.\" Sara was determined to keep the conversation light. \"Oh?\" she teased. \"And how would you know what I imagined him to be?\" \"In your wildest dreams you couldn\u0027t possibly have imagined yourself married to Nathan. He\u0027s a bit overwhelming at first sight, isn\u0027t he?\" \"Oh, I don\u0027t know,\" Sara whispered. \"Of course you do,\" Nora returned. \"You fainted when you saw him that first time, didn\u0027t you?\" \"I was exhausted,\" Sara argued. \"Nora, he wants to… sleep with me,\" she suddenly blurted out. Nora didn\u0027t seem to be at all surprised by that announcement. Sara was acutely relieved that her aunt wasn\u0027t embarrassed. She desperately needed her advice. \"That would be his natural inclination,\" Nora announced. \"Are you afraid, Sara?\" \"A little,\" Sara answered. \"I know what my duty is, but I don\u0027t know him very well, and I did want a courtship.\" \"What is it you\u0027re worried about?\" Sara shrugged. \"Do you think he\u0027s going to hurt you?\" Sara shook her head. \"It\u0027s the most peculiar thing, Aunt. Nathan\u0027s such a ferocious-looking man when he\u0027s frowning at me, which is most of the time, but in my heart I know he won\u0027t hurt me. He even told me he didn\u0027t want me to be afraid of him.\" \"Good.\" \"But he won\u0027t wait until I get used to the idea,\" Sara explained. Nora smiled. \"I would expect that he wouldn\u0027t want to wait, Sara. You are his wife, and I could see the way he watched you that first night. He wants you.\" Sara could feel herself blushing. \"What if I disappoint him?\" \"I don\u0027t believe you will,\" Nora soothed. \"He\u0027ll see to it that you don\u0027t.\" \"We have to have a child if Nathan is going to get the second half of the treasury set aside by the king, and since he was forced to wait to come for me… did you know he thought I had run away from him?\" Sara explained what she\u0027d learned, and when she\u0027d finished Nora was frowning. \"Aren\u0027t you pleased Nathan tried to come for me?\" \"Of course. I\u0027m frowning because I believe your parents have deceived you yet again.\" \"Nora, you can\u0027t believe—\" \"As I told you before,\" Nora interrupted, \"I never quit writing to your mother. I will even allow for the possibility that one or two of my letters got lost, but certainly not all six of them. No, it was all a lie, Sara, to get you out of England.\" \"Mother wouldn\u0027t agree to such a lie.\" \"Of course she would,\" Nora muttered. \"My poor sister is afraid of her husband. She always was, and she always will be. We both know it, Sara, and it\u0027s pointless to pretend to each other. Get your head out of the clouds, child. If Winston told her to lie to you, she would. Now enough about your sorry parents,\" she rushed on when Sara looked as if she was about to interrupt. \"I want to ask you a question.\" \"What is it?\" \"Do you want to be married to Nathan?\" \"It doesn\u0027t matter what I want.\" \"Do you or not?\" \"I\u0027ve never thought about being with anyone else,\" Sara answered hesitantly. \"I don\u0027t really know how I feel, Nora. I dislike the notion of any other woman having him, though. Do you know I didn\u0027t realize that until he mentioned the word \u0027mistress\u0027 to me? I reacted most vehemently to that proposal. It\u0027s all very confusing.\" \"Yes, love is always confusing.\" \"I\u0027m not talking about love,\" Sara countered. \"It\u0027s just that I\u0027ve been trained to think of Nathan as my husband all these years.\" Nora let out an inelegant snort. \"You were trained to hate the man. They thought they\u0027d raised another one just like your sister Belinda, but they couldn\u0027t do it, could they? You don\u0027t hate Nathan at all.\" \"No, I don\u0027t hate anyone.\" \"All these years you\u0027ve protected him in your heart, Sara, just as you\u0027ve protected your mother whenever you had a chance. You listened to their lies about Nathan, and then you discarded them.\" \"They think I hate him,\" Sara confessed. \"I pretended to agree with everything my relatives told me about him so they would leave me alone. Uncle Henry was the worse. Now he knows the truth. When I confronted him in the tavern, when I saw your band on his fat little finger, well, I lost my temper. I boasted that Nathan would retaliate and added to that lie by telling him that Nathan and I had been on the best of terms for a long while.\" \"Perhaps it wasn\u0027t all a lie,\" Nora said. \"I do believe Nathan would retaliate on my behalf in future, Sara. And do you know why?\" \"Because he realizes what a dear, sweet lady you are,\" Sara answered. Nora rolled her eyes heavenward. \"No, dear, I don\u0027t believe he realizes that just yet. He\u0027ll watch out for me because he knows how much you love me. Nathan is the kind of man who takes care of the people close to him.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-gift-crown-s-spies-3/page-14.html","bookId":1790,"book":{"id":1790,"title":"The Gift (Crown\u0027s Spies #3)","description":"Storyline: A child bride, Sara Winchester had grown into a winsome beauty, joyfully anticipating the day when her husband Nathan, Marquess of St. James, would return to claim her heart at last.
