{"id":22224,"no":18,"title":"CHAPTER XVIII","content":"The Chesters of Pinnels End were as much an institution in the Fareham neighbourhood as the Abbey Church, itself. Hospitality was a religion with them, and William Chester and Olivia his wife were never so happy as when their big wandering house was absolutely full. They had six grown-up sons scattered about the world who were forever sending their friends to \"cheer up the old people,\" so they were seldom lonely. They were not particularly rich, certainly not smart--the interior of Pinnels was almost conspicuously shabby--but they were the youngest and cheeriest old people imaginable, and their house was comfortable as are few houses. Those who had once enjoyed its entertainment were fain to return with gleeful frequency. For nearly four hundred years there had been Chesters at Pinnels End--large families of Chesters, and however they may have differed as to politics, religion, or personal taste, they were supremely unanimous in one matter: they none of them could bear any changes at Pinnels. Mrs. Chester used to declare that until a carpet there actually fell to pieces and tripped up her husband and sons, she was never allowed to replace it. That done, it was months before they became resigned, years before they consented to regard it with any but the most grudging toleration, and even then it was compared unfavourably with its predecessors. The party to be assembled at Pinnels consisted of three of the sons--two on leave from India and Egypt respectively; the third an Oxford man who had just taken his degree and was marking time at home while his father sought out an agent with whom to place him to learn estate management--Lallie, Sidney Ballinger, who was asked because he was a neighbour, and because kind Mrs. Chester knew that he would rather be in the same house with Lallie Clonmell than anywhere else on earth. There was Celia Jones, the usual \"nice girl\" of house parties, who possessed no striking characteristics whatsoever; and the remaining guest was a Mrs. Atwood, the wife of a busy doctor in Carlisle. Her host would have found it rather difficult to explain Mrs. Atwood\u0027s presence. He met her while he and his wife were spending a few days in a house of a mutual friend about a fortnight before; and somehow, although he could never remember exactly how it came about, Mrs. Atwood had extracted an invitation from him for this particular week-end. \"Did you take such a fancy to her, father?\" Mrs. Chester asked, when informed of the lady\u0027s projected visit. \"I didn\u0027t care much for her myself, and I shouldn\u0027t have thought she was your sort either.\" \"I can\u0027t say I was greatly attracted, though there\u0027s something rather pleasing and pathetic about her, and she wanted so badly to fill in those four days between two visits. It\u0027s such a deuce of a way back to Carlisle--and she \u0027longed\u0027 so to see Fareham--historic old town, you know--and consulted me about hotels there, and so on. You\u0027ve often done the same thing yourself; you know you have.\" \"Oh, I shall be most pleased to see her and, of course I\u0027ve told her so. Only--I wonder how she\u0027ll fit in with the others.\" \"She\u0027ll fit in right enough; the more the merrier.\" \"I can\u0027t imagine Mrs. Atwood merry under any circumstances.\" \"All the more reason to try and cheer her up,\" Mr. Chester remarked optimistically, and the subject dropped. Eileen Atwood was thirty-six years old, and looked at least five years younger. She was tall, slender, and fair, with a graceful, well-set head, large heavy-lidded and generally downcast blue eyes, a small close mouth, and a chin that would have been markedly receding had she not so persistently drooped her head forward. It is only people with firm chins who can afford to carry their heads in the air. She spoke very low, and was fond of discussing what she was pleased to call \"psychic things.\" She herself would have said that she \"bore an aura of unhappiness\"; and the world in general concluded that Dr. Atwood was not simpatico. She had no children nor, apparently, many domestic claims, for she spent a large portion of her time in paying visits. Simple people considered her intellectual because she used such long and unusual words. Others of proved ability, such as her husband, had a different opinion. Lallie arrived at Pinnels before luncheon. She left B. House by the first available train in the morning--partly because she knew Tony and Miss Foster to be very anxious about Tarrant, who was to be moved to the hospital that morning, and she thought they would be glad to have her out of the way; and partly because she was quite certain that Sidney Ballinger would not travel by such an early train, and she did not desire him as an escort. When they rode to the meet together he had implored her to give him an idea of what time next day she would travel to Fareham, but she persisted that her plans were too uncertain to admit of any information on this point. Therefore did he choose a train that would get him to Fareham in time for tea at Pinnels End, rightly thinking that this was the usual and agreeable time to arrive. He nearly lost his train through procrastination in the matter of taking his seat, having walked the whole length of the train several times peering into every carriage in a vain search for Lallie; and he endured a miserable journey, assailed by dismal doubts and fears lest Lallie had changed her mind and decided not to go at all. It was therefore a great relief when he was ushered into the dark old hall at Pinnels to hear Lallie\u0027s voice raised in song in the duet \"Thou the stream and I the river,\" which she and Billy Chester, the would-be land agent, were performing with great enthusiasm. The drawing-room was almost as dark as the hall, for the lamps had not yet been brought in, and the only lights were from two candles upon the piano and the big fire of logs on the hearth. For years the present owner of Pinnels had been considering the installation of an electric-light plant, but he had never been able to bring himself to such an innovation. \"It would pull the old place about,\" he observed apologetically, \"and, after all, lamps are very handy, you can put \u0027em wherever you want \u0027em.\" Ballinger waited at the open door till the duet had come to a triumphant and crescendoed conclusion, and then preceded the footman bearing tea. He was the last to arrive, and the various greetings over Mrs. Chester led him over to the fireplace, remarking: \"I think you know everybody here except Mrs. Atwood.\" That lady, seated in a particularly dark corner, leant forward, saying in her usual soft tones: \"Mr. Ballinger and I have met before; in fact, we are quite old friends.\" \"Why did you never tell me?\" asked Mrs. Chester, and left them. Mrs. Atwood was in the shadow, but Ballinger was standing in the circle of red light thrown by the fire, and that may have been the cause of his crimson face as he bent over the lady\u0027s hand. Lallie, standing back in the room beside the piano, noticed that he gave a very perceptible start at the sound of Mrs. Atwood\u0027s voice, and that his flushed face betrayed no pleasure at the meeting, for he shook hands with the lady in somewhat perfunctory fashion and immediately moved back to a chair near Mrs. Chester, who was making tea on the other side of the hearth. When the lamps were brought in Mrs. Atwood, who wore a most becoming tea-gown, came forth from her corner and went and sat down near Lallie, who shared a deep window-seat with Billy Chester and was squabbling with him for the last toasted scone. \"You are a very wonderful person, Miss Clonmell,\" she said solemnly. \"I\u0027m glad to hear it,\" Lallie replied politely. \"I\u0027ve long been of that opinion myself, but hitherto I haven\u0027t been able to get people to share it.\" \"Of course they won\u0027t share with you if you\u0027re so greedy about keeping things to yourself--what about that last scone?\" Billy exclaimed reproachfully. Mrs. Atwood ignored Billy. \"I suppose you have studied singing seriously?\" she continued. \"I\u0027m afraid I\u0027m not very serious about anything. But I love music, if that\u0027s what you mean.\" \"I mean a great deal more than that. You are possessed by it. The true artist always is. Don\u0027t you feel every time you sing that you are expressing in the fullest and most perfect form the essential you? That your entity is completed--rounded off as it were; that your very soul becomes tangible in song?\" Billy softly and silently vanished from Lallie\u0027s side; and she, wishing with all her heart that Mrs. Atwood would go and talk to some one else, said humbly: \"I\u0027m afraid I don\u0027t feel nearly all that. I\u0027m a very prosaic person really, and sometimes the inane words one has to sing--well, they get between me and the music and spoil it; though that, too, is inane enough sometimes.\" Mrs. Atwood leant back in her chair and smiled indulgently at Lallie. \"Oh, how I envy you,\" she exclaimed; \"but at the same time I am quite sure that we agree in diathesis: that although we may arrive at our conclusions by different methods, they are practically identical. I cannot conceive that you can possess such a power of self-revelation without the artistic temperament, any more than I can allow that I, lacking means of self-expression, must necessarily lack temperament. I feel that we shall have much in common.\" Lallie looked as though she feared this confidence on Mrs. Atwood\u0027s part was somewhat misplaced and said gravely: \"I should never say that you lacked means of self-expression. You seem to me to have an unusually large vocabulary.\" Mrs. Atwood laughed. \"Now you are making game of me, and I believe I must have frightened Mr. Chester away--too bad. I suppose you know every one here very well. This is my first visit, you know--all strange except dear Mr. and Mrs. Chester, such kind people! Who is that man sitting so close by her?\" Lallie\u0027s seat was considerably higher than Mrs. Atwood\u0027s, and the girl looked down at her with a curiously appraising glance. \"I thought I heard you say just before tea that he is an old friend of yours.\" Mrs. Atwood laughed nervously. \"Oh, that one! Mr. Ballinger; yes, I know him. I meant the tall one leaning against the chimneypiece.\" \"That is Mr. Arnold Chester. He was here at lunch, you know.\" \"So he was, how stupid of me. This lamplight is very confusing.\" It seemed that although Mrs. Atwood spoke in her usual subdued tones that Sidney Ballinger heard his name, for he turned right round and saw Lallie sitting in the deep window-seat. Her head was sharply silhouetted against the white casement curtain, and her eyes, star-sweet and serious, met his in mute challenge. He did not see Mrs. Atwood, his eager gaze was concentrated on the little figure in the window. Hastily setting down his empty cup upon the tray he crossed the room and sat down in Billy Chester\u0027s vacant place, and not even his pince-nez could conceal the gladness in his eyes. \"When did you arrive?\" he asked eagerly; \"I\u0027ve not had the chance to speak to you yet; you might have told me your train----\" Then he saw Mrs. Atwood. His face changed and clouded, and his sudden pause was so marked that Lallie said hastily: \"I came very early; Mrs. Atwood and I arrived almost at the same time from different directions. It was convenient, for it saved the motor going in twice.\" \"And gave us an opportunity to become acquainted on our way out,\" Mrs. Atwood added. She leant back in her low chair and with half-shut eyes lazily looked at the two in the window. Lallie longed to disclaim any sort of acquaintance with Mrs. Atwood, Ballinger seemed possessed by a demon of glum silence, only Mrs. Atwood, in graceful comfort, easily reclining in her deep chair, seemed insensible of any tension in the atmosphere. Lallie felt intensely impatient at Ballinger\u0027s sudden and inconvenient taciturnity. Every one else in the room was talking. Why couldn\u0027t he? Why couldn\u0027t she? For the life of her she couldn\u0027t think of a suitable remark to make. Mrs. Atwood sat very still, a serene little smile just tinging her face with a suspicion of ironical amusement. Lallie became unendurably restless. She felt that if she sat where she was another minute she would say or do something desperate. To get out of her corner she had to pass in front of her neighbour and almost squeeze behind Mrs. Atwood\u0027s chair; with a remark to the effect that it was chilly sitting so far from the fire, she achieved the difficult feat and joined the cheerful group round the tea-table. \"Well?\" said Mrs. Atwood. Ballinger looked at her rather helplessly. He had an irritating habit when embarrassed of holding his hands out in front of him and feebly dangling them from the wrists. He did this now as he remarked obviously: \"I had no idea you were here.\" Mrs. Atwood leaned suddenly toward him. \"Don\u0027t talk banalities,\" she said almost fiercely. \"Have you nothing else to say to me after all these months?\" He pulled himself together. \"Well, really\"--he spoke as though weighing the question carefully--\"I don\u0027t know that I have.\" \"Nevertheless, I shall have something to say to you,\" said Mrs. Atwood.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1778/51830.html","bookId":1107,"book":{"id":1107,"title":"Master and Maid","description":"简介： On the second Friday of term Anthony Bevan, whom all his world called Bruiser Bevan, Housemaster of B.
