{"id":22221,"no":15,"title":"CHAPTER XV","content":"That evening Lallie went into the study to say good-night to Tony. He was reading by the fire, and she came and sat on the floor at his feet, leaning back against his knees as she had done on the evening he corrected papers in the drawing-room. The green silk bag was slung over her arm, but her work was allowed to remain therein, and for once she was content to let her hands lie idle. \"I\u0027ve come early,\" she announced, \"because if you\u0027re not very busy I\u0027d like a little chat. I\u0027ve turned out the lights and shut the door, for Miss Foster\u0027s not coming down again, she says. Isn\u0027t it funny to like to go to bed so early?\" \"She gets up early, I expect; and perhaps she\u0027s very tired at night. Wouldn\u0027t you like a cushion or something, don\u0027t you find the floor very hard?\" \"I\u0027m quite comfortable, thank you. Now listen to me, Tony. Do you think I\u0027m getting to an age when I\u0027d be better with a home of my own?\" With a mental ejaculation of \"Ballinger!\" Tony adjusted his mind to the question, saying quickly: \"But surely you\u0027ve got that already.\" \"No, Tony; that\u0027s just what I have not got. As long as old Madame was alive it was all right. Dad came and went as he pleased, but there was always the house for Paddy and me, whether we were in France or in Ireland. But lately I\u0027ve begun to feel I\u0027m a bit of a drag on Dad; you know how restless he is sometimes, how unexpected----\" \"It\u0027s a family failing, Lallie,\" Tony interrupted. \"And, you see, when he rushes off he won\u0027t leave me alone in whatever house we happen to be in, and Aunt Emileen seems no comfort to him unless he\u0027s in the house along with her; and there\u0027s all the fuss of arranging for me, and I\u0027m sent off here and there on visits, whether I like it or not; and I begin to feel that I\u0027ve no abiding place at all.\" \"Is your visit here one of the \u0027nots\u0027?\" \"Now that\u0027s nasty of you. You know I meant nothing of the kind, and I jumped for joy when Dad said I should come to you for all these months; but when Dad has been home for a bit and the first delight in having me again has worn off, he\u0027ll want to be wandering. If it\u0027s wandering I can do too, that\u0027s all right. I love going about with Dad, but if it\u0027s somewhere that he doesn\u0027t care to take me, like this time, then it\u0027ll all come over again--the placing out--and I hate it.\" \"But, Lallie, most young people like plenty of change and variety; the one thing they cannot away with is monotony. That\u0027s what most of them, girls especially, complain of.\" \"Tony, I\u0027m going to make a confession.\" Lallie turned half round, and leaning an elbow on his knee lifted her face, earnest and serious, so that she might look into his. \"I\u0027m fond of a house. I like housekeeping, and pottering, and looking after things, and ordering dinner, and sewing, and mending, and arranging flowers, and cooking if I want to, and I can cook well; and you can\u0027t do any of these things in other people\u0027s houses--at least, only the sewing part.\" \"I\u0027m sure you may cook here if you wish to. I\u0027ll undertake to eat anything you make if it\u0027s really good.\" \"Oh, it\u0027s not that. I don\u0027t mean that I\u0027d like to be always cooking, but I like to feel that I\u0027ve got a house to look after--my own house. I\u0027d be perfectly happy if Dad wanted a house, but he doesn\u0027t. He kept it up for Paddy and me when we were small because he thought it was the right thing to do; but now he doesn\u0027t seem to think it so necessary. Poor man, he\u0027s too young to have grown-up children, Tony, and that\u0027s a fact. He has small patience with Paddy, because, you know, their interests clash. It\u0027s different with a woman, the younger she is the prouder is she to have grown-up sons and the cleverer she thinks herself that they are grown up. Don\u0027t you think I\u0027m right?\" \"Your generalisation,\" Tony began deliberately, when Lallie interrupted by pinching his knee and exclaiming: \"Now, none of the schoolmaster, I won\u0027t have it.\" \"As I was about to remark when you interrupted me, what you say has a certain amount of truth in it, but your father has not yet returned from India. When he does return he may not feel the slightest inclination for wandering; at any rate, not for some considerable time--so why worry?\" \"I should like to feel settled and secure.\" \"My dear Lallie, you\u0027ll never feel settled, you\u0027re not that sort; and as to security, pray in what way do you feel insecure at present?\" Lallie removed her elbow from Tony\u0027s knee, she leant back against him again so that he could not see her face, and said, very low: \"I feel insecure because in the course of the next few weeks I\u0027ll have to make up my mind definitely one way or other, and whichever way it is, it seems to me I shall regret it.\" Again the whole of Tony\u0027s mentality fairly cried the name of Ballinger aloud, and although the stillness in the quiet room was so great that you might have heard a pin drop it seemed that his thought must have reached Lallie, for she broke the silence by saying in quite a different tone: \"I wish you had met Dad\u0027s friend, Mr. Ballinger, Tony; I\u0027d like to know what you think of him.\" \"That can be easily managed; we\u0027ll ask him to dinner when you come back.\" \"He is going to the Chesters, you know.\" \"I didn\u0027t know, but I\u0027m glad to hear it for your sake, since you like him.\" \"Then you don\u0027t think I\u0027d be better in a home of my own--married, I mean,\" said Lallie with startling bluntness. \"I never said anything of the kind.\" \"Well, you didn\u0027t seem to smile upon the notion.\" \"The notion, as you call it, appears to me in itself quite admirable, if not exactly novel; but you would need to make sure, wouldn\u0027t you? that the husband--I think a husband is included in your scheme of felicity--is in keeping--in the picture as it were.\" Tony\u0027s voice was dry as that in which he instilled the rules of prosody into his form. In fact it was less impassioned, for on occasion he waxed eloquent though vituperative when dealing with that form\u0027s Latin prose. Again Lallie turned half round and leant her elbow on his knee. Again her grey eyes searched his face, apparently in vain, for some clue to the tone in which he spoke. \"I wish I was a rich widow,\" she said vindictively, \"with a nice little place of my own, then there\u0027d be no bother at all, and you could come and stay with me and arrange cricket matches all the summer holidays. I\u0027d put up that eleven you always go off with, and we\u0027d have a cricket week and lovely times.\" \"The prospect is certainly pleasing,\" Tony remarked, without enthusiasm; \"but it seems to me a little callous on your part to be so anxious to kill off your husband before ever you\u0027ve tried one.\" \"Do you think Mr. Johns would make a nice husband?\" Lallie asked in a detached, impersonal sort of way. \"Good heavens! How should I know? I hope he won\u0027t think of being any one\u0027s husband for years to come. He couldn\u0027t keep a wife; for one thing, he\u0027s too poor.\" \"Oh, but he is sure to get on; he\u0027ll be a headmaster some day. You\u0027ll see. I never met a young man who was more wrapped up in his profession. He\u0027s influencing boys all day long.\" \"By Jove! is he though? I\u0027m glad to hear it.\" \"I think he\u0027d be a very kind husband,\" said Lallie, \"but a bit boring sometimes. I suppose I\u0027d better be thinking of bed. You haven\u0027t helped me much, Tony,\" and Lallie arose and stood in front of him, slender and upright, in her straight green gown. Tony rose too. \"I don\u0027t quite know what you wanted me to say, Lallie, but I\u0027d like to say this: Don\u0027t you marry anybody for the sake of having a house of your own. Your mother\u0027s daughter is capable of something finer and better than that. I cannot in all my experience recall such a happy marriage as hers. Child, there is such a thing. Don\u0027t you believe people who say that respect, and affection, and mutual suitability, and all the rest of it are one atom of good if you\u0027re not in love with the man. You spoke to-night of your father\u0027s restlessness. Do you think he would have been like that if your mother had lived? It was simply that he had the most perfect home man ever had on this earth; and when she was taken away from him the wrench destroyed his will-power, and he has been at the mercy of his impulses ever since. Never judge him, Lallie; he can\u0027t help it.\" The tears welled up into Lallie\u0027s eyes. \"I don\u0027t judge him,\" she faltered; \"it\u0027s myself I judge, and blame, and yet I tried so hard to make his home happy and comfortable, so that he\u0027d want to stay with me; and I can make a nice home, I really can, but it wasn\u0027t enough for Dad. Last winter I thought we were settled. He liked the hunting, and we were so happy, and had such jokes about Aunt Emileen, but it all came to an end--and he\u0027d like me to marry, Tony; that\u0027s the har-r-d part.\" The big tears hung on Lallie\u0027s lashes, the corners of her mouth drooped, and she looked so small, and pathetic, and forlorn that Tony fairly turned his back upon her and leant his arms on the chimneypiece, staring with the greatest interest at the shield bearing his college arms, which he did not see. \"I am convinced,\" he said, and his voice was almost gruff, \"that your father would hate to think you married anybody simply for the sake of getting married. Of course he would like to see you well and happily married--but----\" \"Good-night, Tony,\" Lallie said meekly. He turned and shook her outstretched hand and stood at the door watching her as she went slowly up the stairs with drooping head and deep depression in every line of the slender little figure that always looked so much taller than it really was. She never turned her head to look back at rum, and Tony shut the door and sat down at his desk with a groan. Matron was right: he\u0027d got it late, and he\u0027d got it badly. But she was wrong when she informed Val that he didn\u0027t know what was the matter with him. He cursed himself for an old fool; for a betrayer of trust; for a dog in the manger. Fitz wanted Lallie to marry this Ballinger; told him so. And here was he, Tony Bevan, actually using what influence he had to prevent her doing anything of the kind. Fitz wouldn\u0027t want it unless Ballinger were a good fellow. He knew Ballinger and Tony didn\u0027t. Was it likely that Fitz would be anxious for the marriage unless Ballinger was the best of good fellows? And yet, he, Tony, who knew nothing whatever about the man, had interfered. \"But she doesn\u0027t love him!\" cried this old fool, this betrayer of a father\u0027s trust. \"How do you know?\" sternly demanded the inward mentor; \"is she a girl to wear her heart upon her sleeve? She may be deeply in love with him, but won\u0027t confess it to herself even, just because he is rich and eligible, and because she would like a home of her own.\" \"She doesn\u0027t seem a bit in love with him,\" pleaded the fatuous one. \"Lallie in love would----\" The mentor shrugged his shoulders and retired, for Tony Bevan had embarked upon a sea of speculation so deliciously problematical, so wholly removed from such sober themes as duty and expediency, that it was hopeless just then by the clearest call to reach ears that were deaf to all but the siren song. \"I wonder,\" mused Tony, \"if I\u0027d met her now for the first time, if she hadn\u0027t always put me down as a friend of her father\u0027s, worlds away from any touch of sentiment--I wonder if, as a mere man, I might have had a chance. Upon my soul I\u0027d have tried for it.\" For a good half hour Tony sat dreaming; then he stooped and patted Val, remarking, \"I\u0027m d--d if she\u0027s in love with Ballinger,\" and Val wagged his tail in cordial assent.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1778/51827.html","bookId":1107,"book":{"id":1107,"title":"Master and Maid","description":"简介： On the second Friday of term Anthony Bevan, whom all his world called Bruiser Bevan, Housemaster of B.
