KING AND Co., BOMBAY, INDIA. \n \n \"MY DARLING DAD, \n \n \"It\u0027s eleven o\u0027clock at night and I ought to be getting to bed, but it\u0027s mail day to-morrow and I\u0027m going to the Chesters at Fareham quite early, so I\u0027ll do your letter to-night. I\u0027m sleepy enough, for I\u0027ve been out with the Hamchester hounds to-day. Mr. Ballinger has come to hunt here, why, I leave you to imagine, and he mounted me and took me. Tony had forbidden me to go till we heard from you, but he went to Oxford; then I met Mr. Ballinger; then I had ever such a row with Miss Foster, and I felt reckless; and as Tony was not there to make me feel conscientious or repentant I went. I didn\u0027t enjoy it much, though the day and the little mare and the run were all as good as they could be. Mr. Ballinger is going to the Chesters also. There\u0027s a Primrose meeting to-morrow night, and I\u0027ve got to sing some absurd tum-ti-tum sort of Jingo song about Empire and Tariff Reform and a large loaf. They call it a \u0027topical\u0027 song over here. I\u0027d much rather sing them \u0027The Vicar of Bray\u0027 or \u0027Love\u0027s Young Dream\u0027 or \u0027Rory O\u0027More,\u0027 but they won\u0027t let me. I offered to. \n \n \"Dad, dear, you will have gathered from my letters that Miss Foster and I do not exactly hit it off. I could forgive her not liking me, though I think it\u0027s bad taste on her part, if only she wouldn\u0027t treat me as though I were a contagious disease. The boys call her Germs, but indeed it\u0027s me that she makes feel a mass of microbes of the most noxious kind. She\u0027s rude, Dad, downright rude; and it would be absurd to say she doesn\u0027t mean it, for she does. And what\u0027s more, she takes care that I know she means it. I wouldn\u0027t mind a bit if she was ever so pernicketty and peppery if only she would be kind and pleasant sometimes, but she never is pleasant--to me. And yet I can\u0027t help admiring her for the way she looks after B. House. She really loves the boys, and if one of them is the least little bit ill Miss Foster is in a dreadful way. Both she and Tony are very worried just now because a boy is ill. They fear he has got scarlet fever. There has been a case in another house. \n \n \"Miss Foster has taken it into her head that I am bad for the boys, and that\u0027s one reason why she dislikes me. In what way I\u0027m bad for them I don\u0027t know, and any that I have met seem to like talking to me, but whenever they do, I can see she is worried. I think she likes Tony awfully--but who doesn\u0027t? Yet she doesn\u0027t seem to make a really comfortable home for him somehow. As for poor Paunch! she hates him as much as she hates me, and never says a civil word to him. \n \n \"Paunch and I are great friends; we sit and shiver together in the chill blast of Miss Foster\u0027s displeasure, and \u0027a fellow feeling makes us wondrous kind,\u0027 especially Paunch. He is a most earnest young man, Dad; all day long he is thinking of the influence he may be on others, and the result is that Tony, who never thinks about himself at all, makes far more impression when he tells a boy he\u0027s a silly young ass than Paunch would if he talked about ideals till Doomsday. It\u0027s very odd how the boys really care what Tony thinks; of course they don\u0027t say so, but any one can see it. Mr. Johns is awfully good at games, so the boys respect that. The other day I asked Mr. Hamilton, one of the pre\u0027s, if Tony ever gave them a \u0027pi-jaw\u0027 as they call it. \n \n \"He looked very funny for a minute, and then he said, \u0027I don\u0027t know any one I\u0027d sooner go to than old Bruiser if I was in a very bad mess.\u0027 It wasn\u0027t an answer to my question, but it was enlightening all the same. Tony makes me think of those lines at the beginning of \u0027Stalky\u0027: \n \n \"\u0027For they taught us common sense, \n Tried to teach us common sense, \n Truth and God\u0027s own common sense, \n Which is more than knowledge.\u0027 \n \n \n \"I was reading \u0027Stalky\u0027 last night, and that seemed to me to explain Tony. The queer thing is that both Mr. Johns and Miss Foster, though they love him dearly, think Tony is a bit of a slacker. Miss Foster, because he will not work himself up into a fever whenever there\u0027s a rumour of mumps or chicken-pox; and Mr. Johns because Tony never talks about moral training, and never seems to be watching or prying about the boys; and yet I remember Paddy saying that somehow undesirable chaps never come back to B. House, though how or why nobody never knows, and I\u0027m certain Tony\u0027s ideals are quite as high as Mr. Johns\u0027, although he never talks about them. \n \n \"I think it\u0027s rather a great thing, don\u0027t you, to send so many boys out into the world so that they keep straight and work and are useful members of the community, and so that they remember you and know you\u0027d be awfully sorry if things went wrong. All the years I\u0027ve known Tony, I\u0027ve thought it such a pity he was anything so humdrum as a schoolmaster. Since I\u0027ve been here I don\u0027t think that any more. I think it\u0027s such a jolly good thing for all the boys who\u0027ve come under him. I wish he\u0027d had the house all the time Paddy was there; but then, Paddy had him in the holidays, so it didn\u0027t matter so much. \n \n \"Paddy seems very happy at the Shop. He knows a lot of gunner people outside, and he goes out every Saturday and Sunday, but he\u0027s rather sick that they don\u0027t ride till their second term. \n \n \"Please don\u0027t fancy I\u0027m unhappy here, I like it awfully. Every one is as kind and jolly as possible, and the attitude of Germs just gives the necessary touch of excitement to the situation. She positively dislikes music, poor woman, so I must be a trying guest. I\u0027m obliged to practise, for I\u0027m always singing somewhere. The music-hater is decidedly in the minority in this world. \n \n \"I\u0027m afraid, Dad, that Mr. Ballinger means to propose again very shortly, and Tony says I ought not to marry any one I\u0027m not really in love with, and I can\u0027t imagine myself in love with Mr. Ballinger, though I do like him, really, he\u0027s so kind and nice and says such agreeable things. \n \n \"Tony is not so amusing here as at home. He\u0027s a tiny bit stiff sometimes. I suppose it\u0027s the atmosphere. It must be awful to think all the time about setting an example, like Mr. Johns--so tiring. But he seems to thrive under it, and Tony says he\u0027ll be stout if he doesn\u0027t take care. \n \n \"I hope you\u0027ll bring back a lot of nice skins. They\u0027re a mangy lot in the drawing-room over in Kerry, some new ones will be a great improvement. \n \n \"Please write me longer letters, dear Dad. I\u0027m very homesick sometimes, and I miss Bridget, but she could never have got on with Miss Foster; and if she heard Miss Foster speak nastily to me there would be wigs on the green indeed. It\u0027s a good thing Biddy is not here. \n \n \"I wonder why extreme monotony in the matter of meals is considered so beneficial to the youthful palate. It wouldn\u0027t cost a penny more to have a little variety, but they never do in the houses. There\u0027s heaps and heaps to eat, even the boys own that, but it is so dull for them having the same things over and over again. I\u0027d love to go into Tony\u0027s kitchen and teach that cook of his how to make real good soup and a proper haricot. Dinner is always a nice meal, but Miss Foster has no imagination. I wonder what she\u0027d do if she had to keep house for you. She\u0027d probably grovel to you because you\u0027d bully her. Now, as it is, she bullies Tony, and he can\u0027t call his soul his own. They say, (Who are they? I hear you ask), well, rumour hath it that if Tony ever wants to get married he\u0027ll have to do it in the holidays secretly, and then bring his wife home to have it out with Miss Foster. I can\u0027t imagine Tony married, can you? Oh, I\u0027d hate it. I do hope he won\u0027t. \n \n \"Good-night, my dearest Dad. I\u0027m really quite good here on the whole, though I did disobey Tony about hunting just this once. \n \n \"Your own loving daughter, \n \n \"LALLIE.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1778/51828.html","bookId":1107,"book":{"id":1107,"title":"Master and Maid","description":"简介： On the second Friday of term Anthony Bevan, whom all his world called Bruiser Bevan, Housemaster of B.
