{"id":22216,"no":10,"title":"CHAPTER X","content":"Meanwhile, Tony was daily getting more and more used to Lallie\u0027s presence. The pleasant, almost exciting sense of novelty had worn off, giving place to a still pleasanter feeling of familiar security. \\n\\n \\n\\n She would be there when he got back, this girl with the soft full voice and delightful welcoming manner, and he found himself watching the clock like the laziest boy in his form during the last hour of afternoon school. \\n\\n \\n\\n For years past, although he lived in a crowd and possessed troops of friends, he had been rather a lonely man, and his loneliness was accentuated rather than lessened when he came into possession of B. House. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Truly you may call it a \u0027house,\u0027\" he said to a congratulating college friend. \"It\u0027s far less of a home than my old diggings. I don\u0027t feel as though a single stick of the furniture really belongs to me except my old arm-chair and my desk.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Now, however, he thought more fondly of B. House; particularly of his study, where he knew that he would find a bright fire, the little tea-table drawn up beside his chair, and the brass kettle singing merrily over the spirit lamp. Not that these things were new. There had always been tea laid for him in his study when he came in at half-past five; but now it was Lallie who made the tea, not Ford, and Lallie made excellent tea. Moreover, she always had a great deal to ask and to tell. She took the deepest interest in all College matters, and absolutely declined to regard anything from a tutorial standpoint; and this in itself was restful and refreshing to Tony. \\n\\n \\n\\n To her, Tony Bevan was above all the old friend tried by time; \"the best of good sorts,\" \"the decentest old thing.\" That he happened also to be a schoolmaster was perhaps unfortunate, but she generously declined to let this regrettable fact influence her attitude towards him. \\n\\n \\n\\n She knew well that he wanted her above all things to be happy, and with him she always was happy. Furthermore she had loyally kept her resolution not to worry Tony with any knowledge of the friction that existed between herself and Miss Foster. He was not much at B. House, and being of a good-natured and tolerant disposition himself, he always gave other people credit for being similarly well disposed until he had ample proof to the contrary. Besides, in his presence Lallie and Miss Foster almost unconsciously adopted a manner towards one another that was at least free from signs of open hostility. \\n\\n \\n\\n When Lallie had been a week at B. House she took her host\u0027s personal appearance firmly in hand. In the morning she flew after him to brush his coat before he went up to College. She exclaimed indignantly at the \"bagsomeness\" of his trouser knees. Finding that he did not possess any form of trouser-press she insisted on his going with her into the town to buy one. And when it was sent home, she folded the offending garments and placed them in it herself. She objected to ties that looked \"like a worn-out garter,\" and said so. She even suggested that certain old and well-loved coats might be sent to the Mission, but here Tony was firm in his opposition. He would buy a new suit to please her, but part with his old coats he would not; and Lallie was far too diplomatic to press the matter. \\n\\n \\n\\n She tried always to be at home to make tea for him when he came in at half-past five, and cut short many a tea-party to keep this tryst. She was in great demand at other houses, especially the houses where the heads were musical. \\n\\n \\n\\n She was waiting for Tony on the evening of the footprint encounter with Miss Foster, and when she had fed and warmed and cosseted him generally she sat down in the big chair opposite his and faced him squarely, announcing: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hunting begins this week, Tony.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Does it really? How the year is getting on.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Tony, dear, don\u0027t you think I might hunt if I took out one of the men from the riding school as groom--just one day a week?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Tony shook his head. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If your father had wanted you to hunt I am sure he would have suggested it, and he would probably have made arrangements for you to have a couple of the horses over; but he has never so much as mentioned it, and I can\u0027t let you do it on my own responsibility. I don\u0027t believe he\u0027d like it for you here either. It isn\u0027t as if I could go with you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Much good you\u0027d be if you could go with me. You know, Tony, you are not at your best across a horse. As for Dad not having made arrangements--this Indian trip was got up and settled in such a tremendous hurry, he had no time to think about me at all. Listen to me now! How would you feel if when they began to mow the grass in May, and the good smell was in the air, and you saw all the others in their flannels, and heard all round you the nice deep ring of the cricket balls--and you mightn\u0027t play a stroke, and your arm as strong and your eye as true as ever it was. How would you like it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I shouldn\u0027t like it at all; but----\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, then, think of me. The smell of the wet dead leaves and the south wind blowing the soft rain against my face is just as full of association for me. And I never go out but I see long strings of horses in their nice new clothing, the dear darlings! And me, ME, that has gone hunting on the opening day ever since I could sit a fat little Shetland pony, ME to stay pokily at home! Tony, I simply can\u0027t! You must let me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Lallie, the two cases are not analogous. You can go out riding whenever you like, provided you take a man; but hunting, no. Not without your father\u0027s permission. Especially here, you are too young--too----\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Too what? You can\u0027t say I\u0027m timid. You can\u0027t say I couldn\u0027t ride any mount they choose to give me at that old school. Look here, Tony, suppose they said, \u0027You may play cricket--oh, yes, at the nets with a wee little junior boy to bowl to you; but no matches, no playing with people who play as well as you do\u0027--would you say \u0027Thank you\u0027? And that\u0027s precisely what you offer me. Let me tell you I ride just as well as you play cricket--blue and all; and to please you I\u0027ve even gone pounding round that ridiculous racecourse with half a dozen other girls who sit a horse like a sack of potatoes, who\u0027d be off at every bounce but for the pommel. D\u0027you think I call that riding? Oh, Tony, dear, if I could just have one good gallop across country after the hounds, I\u0027d be a better girl--much nicer and easier to get on with.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t find you particularly hard to get on with as it is.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Other people do, though\"--Lallie\u0027s conscience pricked her as to Miss Foster--\"and I dare say I\u0027m often a great nuisance; but once let me work the steam off on the back of a good horse and I\u0027d be an angel. Just you let me go out with the hounds on Thursday and you\u0027ll see.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Lallie, my child, don\u0027t. I would if I could, but I simply dare not. Your father would never forgive me. It was quite different last winter when he was there himself to look after you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My dear, good man, a hunting field isn\u0027t like the \u0027croc\u0027 of a girls\u0027 school. No one can \u0027look after\u0027 anybody else. You either ride straight or you potter, or you rush your fences and get in people\u0027s way. But whatever you do you\u0027re on your own. If you come a bad smash there\u0027s always a hurdle to lay you on, and a doctor and a farmhouse somewhere about. If you think Dad kept me in his pocket three days a week throughout the hunting season all these years, you\u0027ve a more fertile imagination than I gave you credit for, and Dad would be the first to disillusion you. We went to the meets together, and after that we saw precious little of one another.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What about riding home?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hardly ever did we come home together. Sometimes he got home first, sometimes I did; and whichever of us was first in got the bath, and the other was pretty sure to come pounding at the door before the early bird was out of it. You can\u0027t chaperon people out hunting. Why, by the time I\u0027d been out three times here, I\u0027d know the whole field, and you\u0027d be perfectly happy knowing I was among friends.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Lallie sat forward in her chair gazing eagerly at Tony, who said nothing at all; but from the expression of his face it might have been gathered that this prediction of her speedy intimacy with all the field gave him no satisfaction whatever. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, Tony?\" she demanded impatiently. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry, but it\u0027s impossible. You can write to Fitz if you like and ask him to cable his opinion.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, indeed. I\u0027ll write and tell him that unless he cables forbidding me, I\u0027m going to hunt. Dad will always do the easiest thing, and I know will never bother to cable forbidding me to do a thing I\u0027ve done for years.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Lallie\u0027s voice was almost defiant, and poor Tony looked very pained, but he said nothing; and after a minute\u0027s silence she continued in a more conciliatory tone: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then in a fortnight\u0027s time from next mail if I don\u0027t hear, I may hunt?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You must give him three weeks, for he may be up country, and his mail takes days to reach him after the agent gets it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And by that time there\u0027ll be a frost; I didn\u0027t think it of you, Tony, I really didn\u0027t. In this matter you out-Emileen Aunt Emileen herself.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Tony rose. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You have my leave to depart,\" he said, opening the door for her; \"I\u0027ve a lot of letters to write, and those chaps are coming to bridge after dinner, so I must do them now.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, I think you\u0027re horrid, and if a slate falls on my head and kills me when I\u0027m out walking, just you reflect how nice and safe I\u0027d have been if I\u0027d had my own way and been out in the open country.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll risk the slate,\" Tony remarked unfeelingly; but still he would not look at Lallie, who stood in the doorway gazing reproachfully at him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And you\u0027re going to play bridge and have a nice time while I sit solemnly in the drawing-room making a waistcoat for you, ungrateful man. You\u0027ve never asked me to take a hand, and I play quite well.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You see, this is a club; we meet at each other\u0027s houses--there are no ladies----\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of all the monastical establishments I\u0027ve ever come across this is the strictest, and you call Ireland a priest-ridden country.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Lallie, I must write my letters.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n At that moment Mr. Johns came into the hall, bearing a large and heavy book. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, you deny me everything that keeps me out of mischief--on your own head be it,\" said Lallie rapidly, in low tones of ominous menace. Then, turning to the newcomer, she smiled a radiant welcome, exclaiming joyously: \"You\u0027ve brought your snapshots to show me! How kind of you! I\u0027m badly in need of something to cheer me up. Come into the drawing-room, for Mr. Bevan is busy and Miss Foster\u0027s out, so we\u0027ll have it all to ourselves.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n With quite unnecessary violence Mr. Bevan rang the bell for Ford to take away tea. Yet, when Ford, looking rather aggrieved, had responded to his noisy summons and removed the tea-things with her customary quiet deftness, he did not sit down at once to deal with his correspondence. Instead, he went and stood in front of the fire staring at the Greuze girl who was so like Lallie. \\n\\n \\n\\n He ran his fingers through his smooth thick hair--a sure sign of mental perturbation with Tony--and he made the discovery that he was furiously angry; not with Lallie, the wilful and inconsequent, but with the unoffending Mr. Johns. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Confound the fellow and his snapshots!\" thought Tony; \"if there\u0027s one kind of hobby more detestable than another it\u0027s that of the ardent amateur photographer. A man given up to it is almost as bad as the chap who wears cotton-wool in his ears, and is always taking medicine. There were these two\" (with the second-sight vouchsafed to most of us upon occasion, Tony was perfectly correct in his surmise) \"sitting side by side on the sofa with their heads close together, and that great heavy book spread out on their joint knees. Heavens! he would be proposing to snapshot Lallie next\" (which is precisely what Mr. Johns was doing at that moment). \"He, Tony, would not have it. He would interfere, he would--\" Suddenly, exclaiming aloud, \"What an ass I am!\" he sat down at his desk with the firm determination to attend to his letters. He drew a neatly docketed bundle towards him, and selected the top one. It was that of Uridge Major\u0027s father, who wrote pointing out what a steadying effect it would have upon the boy were he made a prefect that term. Tony dealt diplomatically with this, but instead of going methodically through the bundle as he had fully intended to do he drew from his pocket a letter he had received from Fitzroy Clonmell last mail. It consisted of two closely written sheets; the first mainly descriptive of the sport they were enjoying, and duly concluded with the pious hope that his daughter was behaving herself. This was manifestly intended to be shown to Lallie. It was the second sheet that Tony read and re-read when he ought to have been allaying the misgivings of anxious-minded parents. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"By the way,\" it ran, \"if one Sidney Bargrave Ballinger should happen to call upon Lallie while she is with you, be decent to him, will you? He fell hopelessly in love with her at Fareham last winter, and followed us to Ireland for fishing in the spring, when he proposed and she refused him. Consequently she is unlikely ever to have mentioned his name. The frankest and most garrulous creature about all that concerns herself, she is extraordinarily reticent as to things concerning other people, especially if she thinks it might be in any way unpleasant for them to have their affairs discussed. They parted quite good friends, and I take it as not unlikely that she might be brought to reconsider her decision. You will probably think him a bit of a crock--old son of Anak that you are! So he is in some ways, but he is also quite a good sort, refined, kind-hearted, and a gentleman; a Trinity man, with somewhat scholarly tastes. I am sure he would make her a good and indulgent husband. Besides, he has an uncommonly nice place in Garsetshire, and about eight thousand a year. He came into this money quite recently through the death of an uncle, and having now a \u0027stake in the country\u0027 he feels, I suppose, that he ought to be a bit of a sportsman, and he does his best to achieve that character, although I don\u0027t believe he has a single sporting instinct in him. He broke his collar-bone the second time he came out hunting last season; but he hunted again the minute it was mended, and rode as queerly as ever. He followed us to Kerry for fishing in April, and flogged the stream all day without getting a single rise; but he contrived to see something of Lallie, which was what he came for. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Should he appear in Hamchester I\u0027d like to know how he strikes you. I\u0027m so horribly afraid she may want to marry some impecunious soldier chap imported by Paddy, who will carry her off to a vile climate where she would assuredly go under in a year or two, that it would be a real comfort to me to see her safely married to a good fellow who could give her all the pleasures she most cares for and has been accustomed to; and even if he isn\u0027t a sportsman himself would not be averse from her fond father occasionally sharing in the same--but this is a very secondary consideration. A son-in-law will be such an incubus that nothing he can bring in his hand will mitigate the nuisance much. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Perhaps he won\u0027t turn up at all, but if he does, don\u0027t cold-shoulder him--he has my blessing. Give him his chance. She\u0027ll follow her own line of country in any long run, but there\u0027s no harm in giving her an occasional lead in the most desirable direction. I wish he hadn\u0027t been called Sidney, it\u0027s a name I detest; still, we can call him by his middle name if it ever reaches the necessity for a familiar appellation. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Salve atque vale. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"From yours. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Fitz.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Tony knit his brows and pondered. Had Mr. Sidney Bargrave Ballinger already arrived? he wondered. Was that why Lallie was so ardently desirous of going out with the hounds on Thursday? No; he acquitted her of any form of stratagem. If she had seen the man she would have mentioned it. She always made a bee-line for anything she wanted, and intrigue was as foreign to her nature as mischief-making. \\n\\n \\n\\n He was worried and irritable; he couldn\u0027t settle to his letters; and he felt quite unaccountably annoyed with Fitz for thus shifting the burden of responsibility from his own shoulders to Tony\u0027s. And Tony, being of a just and charitable temperament, took himself seriously to task for having instantaneously and irrevocably taken a violent dislike to the unseen and unknown Sidney Bargrave Ballinger. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1778/51822.html","bookId":1107,"book":{"id":1107,"title":"Master and Maid","description":"简介： On the second Friday of term Anthony Bevan, whom all his world called Bruiser Bevan, Housemaster of B.
