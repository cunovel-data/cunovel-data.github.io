{"id":22212,"no":6,"title":"CHAPTER VI","content":"For five terms, in fact ever since Miss Foster had been housekeeper at B. House, she had never left that house during term time for a single night. And on her arrival at Hamchester station on Tuesday afternoon, having been away from the previous Friday, she almost ran down the long platform to collect her luggage, hustled her porter, nor rested a moment till she had seized upon the first available cab to take to her destination. After years of generally unsuccessful ventures in various directions, Miss Foster had at last found a post entirely after her own heart, and the whole of her by no means inconsiderable energy was absorbed by B. House. She declared that it gave her scope. She was convinced that she, and she alone, \"ran\" B. House. She regarded Tony merely as an amiable figure-head. She liked him; she knew him to be honourable and well-meaning, and had found him generous in his business relations, and of course he was necessary, as otherwise she, herself, might not have been there; nevertheless, in her heart of hearts she was convinced that she, and she alone, kept the machinery of B. House in working order. Tony was far too easy-going, far too easily imposed upon. She distrusted the matron, and for Mr. Johns she felt an irritated sort of contempt, which she was at small pains to conceal: did not this misguided young man dare to entertain the incredibly conceited notion that he ran B. House? This in itself was more than enough to condemn him in Miss Foster\u0027s eyes. A handsome woman, tall, plump, fresh-coloured, she made no attempt to look younger than her forty-nine years. She wore her plentiful grey hair dressed high over a cushion, well waved and beautifully arranged; no one ever saw Miss Foster with an untidy head. Her hats were always large and imposing, and occasionally becoming; her dresses rich, rustling, sober in colour, and thoroughly well made. \"All must have gone smoothly in my absence,\" she thought complacently as she sat in the jolting cab. \"Mr. Bevan faithfully promised that if there was illness of any kind he would telegraph at once. Cripps can\u0027t have got the mumps. He probably won\u0027t get it, and if he does it can\u0027t spread as he was quarantined at once. I hope Matron has been strict about the quarantine. I always mistrust these hospital-trained people when left to themselves; one has to be ever on the watch. Ah, here we are!\" Before Miss Foster could descend from the cab Ford appeared to help her with her smaller baggage. Ford looked particularly trim and smiling that afternoon in a nice new muslin apron and cap. \"All well, Ford?\" Miss Foster remarked genially, without waiting for an answer. \"You may bring tea at once to the drawing-room; I\u0027ll have it before I go upstairs.\" She crossed the hall and opened the drawing-room door, but she did not enter the room. Instead she stood transfixed upon the threshold and sniffed dubiously. The windows were open according to her instructions whenever the room was untenanted. Notwithstanding this, there was a very strong smell of violets. To most people this is an agreeable odour, but Miss Foster mistrusted the presence of violets at all. Why should there be violets in her drawing-room during her absence? A few steps farther revealed to her astonished gaze that the room was not as she had left it. The furniture had been changed as to position, disarranged, increased! Miss Foster was not fond of music, and she beheld with positive dismay that a grand piano, open, with long lid slanted upwards, was placed athwart the inner wall. A huge harp stood just behind it, and an unfamiliar bulging green silk bag was flung on the Chesterfield, where it sprawled in flagrant publicity. The overpowering scent of violets was easily traceable to a large china bowl, full of that modest flower, which stood on a little table, moved from its accustomed place against the wall close to a big chair by the fireplace. Moreover, on that table, cheek by jowl with the violets, lay a tin of \"Player\u0027s Navy Cut,\" a common box of kitchen matches, an ash-tray, and a very brown meershaum pipe. Miss Foster passed her hand over her eyes to make sure that these things were not an hallucination, and at that moment Ford came in, bearing tea. \"What on earth is the meaning of all this, Ford?\" poor Miss Foster exclaimed, waving her hand in the direction of the piano. \"It\u0027s been got for Miss Clonmell, \u0027m. This morning the men brought the piano; she brought \u0027er \u0027arp with her.\" \"Who brought a harp?\" Miss Foster cried irritably, as though she could hardly believe her ears. \"Ford, what are you talking about?\" \"Miss Clonmell, miss--the young lady as have come to live here.\" \"A young lady! To live here! But who is she, and when did she come, and why have I been told nothing about it?\" \"She\u0027s sister to the Mr. Clonmell what was here last term, \u0027m, and she came unexpected like on Friday evening, while Mr. Bevan was at dinner. He didn\u0027t expect her any more than you, miss.\" \"But what in the world has she come for? She can\u0027t stay here. Where is she?\" \"I don\u0027t exactly know \u0027m,\" Ford answered, with demure enjoyment of the situation. \"Mrs. Wentworth came directly after luncheon, \u0027m, and took her out. Miss Clonmell said as I was to ask you not to wait tea if you came before she got back, as she\u0027ll probably have hers with Mrs. Wentworth.\" \"Wait tea!\" Miss Foster repeated, in tones that expressed volumes of determination to do nothing of the kind. \"This is the most extraordinary thing I ever heard of. What is she like?\" \"Oh, a very nice young lady, \u0027m. No one could \u0027elp liking \u0027er. The \u0027ouse seems a different place since she come, so much livelier; and she sings and plays something beautiful----\" \"I should think it does seem a different place,\" Miss Foster remarked grimly; \"that horrible harp makes my drawing-room look like the deck of a penny steamer. It can\u0027t stay here, that\u0027s certain. However, I\u0027ll have tea now--I need it. Whenever Mr. Bevan comes in, Ford, ask him to be good enough to speak to me at once.\" Miss Foster sat in her accustomed chair and made tea. The tea was good and refreshing, but although she had purposely turned her back to the obnoxious musical instruments she felt uncomfortably conscious of their presence. There they were like a draught blowing down her back. A harp, too! In Miss Foster\u0027s mind harps were associated mainly with mendicity and the bars of public-houses. Not that she had the smallest personal knowledge of such objectionable places; but she was certain that the horrid people who frequented them played and listened to the harp. It was probably their favourite instrument, and it was more likely that during their disreputable orgies they even danced to its throbbing strains. Miss Foster, who had never been out of her own country, was one of those persons who inevitably associate Scotland with plaids and porridge, and Ireland with pigs and shillelaghs. \"An unsatisfactory, ungrateful, untrustworthy race, the Irish,\" she reflected; \"and if the sister is half as troublesome as the brother--and being a girl she is certain to be ten times more so; I detest girls--the prospect is far from pleasing. What I cannot understand is the underhand behaviour of Mr. Bevan. This girl can\u0027t have dropped from the clouds, and I consider it most ungentlemanly of him not to have given me some warning. He might at least have written to tell me of her arrival, and I would have come back yesterday. However, I don\u0027t fancy her visit will be a very long one now that I have come back.\" She took a vigorous bite out of her piece of bread and butter, and stirred her tea with a determination that boded ill for the interloper. Yet, resolute woman as she was, she still smelt the violets and was aware of the grand piano in the background. She had just finished her second cup of tea when Tony came in. \"Ah, Miss Foster, it\u0027s nice to see you back again. I hope the wedding went off well--you had a lovely day. I\u0027m just in time to beg for a cup of tea. I suppose Ford has told you of the addition to our party; I didn\u0027t write, as you were away for such a brief holiday; it seemed too bad to bother you.\" Somehow Miss Foster found it impossible to say all the bitter things to Tony that she had been preparing. He was so friendly, so kind, so interested in all her doings. Besides, he explained at once how Lallie\u0027s sudden appearance had been as great a surprise to him as to Miss Foster, and she was fain to believe him; but none the less did she determine that the said visit should be brief as unexpected. Tony took it for granted she would do her best for the girl. So she would. It would certainly be best for the girl and for B. House that the girl\u0027s visit should not be unduly prolonged. When Tony left the drawing-room that afternoon Miss Foster was more than ever persuaded that he badly needed some one to stand between him and those who took advantage of his good nature, and she there and then valiantly resolved that, so far as in her lay, she would act as that buffer. She was still glowing at the prospect of the friction such fortitude on her part would assuredly entail when Tony came back into the room. He might almost be said to have crept back, so shamefaced was his appearance. \"I fear that I have left some of my belongings in here,\" he mumbled apologetically. \"I must have put them down when I came in to speak to Lallie, after lunch--and forgotten them.\" Oh, mendacious Tony! when he knew perfectly well that those \"belongings\" had been left on that table ever since Lallie\u0027s second evening in B. House, and he had smoked there ruthlessly every evening since. \"It doesn\u0027t matter in the least,\" Miss Ford said graciously; \"one couldn\u0027t smell even tobacco with these overpowering flowers. I really must ask Ford to throw them out; they are enough to give us all hay-fever.\" Tony fled.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1778/51818.html","bookId":1107,"book":{"id":1107,"title":"Master and Maid","description":"简介： On the second Friday of term Anthony Bevan, whom all his world called Bruiser Bevan, Housemaster of B.
