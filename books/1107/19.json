{"id":22225,"no":19,"title":"CHAPTER XIX","content":"When Sidney Ballinger was at Trinity, Dr. Atwood had a practice in Cambridge. Mrs. Atwood was by way of being guide, philosopher, and friend to a good many undergraduates, and in Sidney Ballinger\u0027s case the friendship had assumed proportions quite other than Platonic. \n \n He was flattered and grateful, his feeling for her being a subtle compound of inclination, gratified vanity, and a sort of pleased surprise that he was such a devil of a fellow. For Sidney was not then of much importance either in the world at large or in that smaller world of University life. He was good in the schools and of no use whatever in the athletic set. He did not speak at debates, nor act, nor perform at any of the various Musical Societies; in fact, he was a hard-working, rather simple-minded, inconspicuous young man until Mrs. Atwood got hold of him and taught him to believe himself complex, unusual, and misunderstood. She could not spoil his work, for he was shrewd enough in some ways, but she did contrive to develop a great deal that was artificial and petty in his character, whereas her feeling for him was as nearly sincere as emotion ever is in a nature that continually poses, as much to quicken its own spirit as to impress others. \n \n They were both young and enthusiastic, but neither of them ever contemplated any very vigorous flight in the faces of the conventional. They saw each other constantly during term time, and often read Swinburne together. In the vacations they wrote long letters, and Sidney went about feeling very superior to the common herd of undergraduates who merely fell in love with people\u0027s unmarried sisters during May week. \n \n The Atwoods left Cambridge during Sidney\u0027s fourth year there, which may have accounted for his exceedingly good degree. After he was called to the Bar he saw very little of Mrs. Atwood. As she put it, \"they drifted apart.\" She did occasionally come to London, where they would meet, and he listened sympathetically to her complaints as to the \"hebetude\" of the inhabitants of Carlisle, but their letters were brief and few; in fact, the whole affair would have died a natural death but for his sudden and unexpected inheritance of his uncle\u0027s property. In his case all feeling for Mrs. Atwood, except a mildly reminiscent sort of affectation, was dead, and being sincerely desirous of doing his duty in the new station of life to which he had been called, he laid aside many youthful follies and affections; in fact, he set himself seriously to become the ideal landed proprietor. \n \n On Mrs. Atwood, Sidney\u0027s sudden accession to a considerable fortune had quite another effect. Vistas of a hitherto undreamt-of possibility stretched before her; she beheld in imagination the world well lost and herself and Sidney fleeing to sunnier climes in a yacht she would help him to choose. She was a good sailor. He was not, but this she did not know. \n \n Everything would arrange itself. Her \"unloving, unloved\" husband would doubtless soon get over it and she-- But it is fruitless to pursue Mrs. Atwood\u0027s reflections. She wrote many letters to Sidney. To some he replied with matter-of-fact civility, but he left a great many unanswered, especially of late. \n \n Time had precisely opposite effects upon their respective temperaments. The flame of Mrs. Atwood\u0027s desire for Sidney burned stronger and fiercer; while in him there remained but a few grey ashes upon the altar of his love. Naturally tidy, he objected even to these frail reminders of the past, and did his best to sweep them away. Then he met Lallie and fell honestly and hopelessly in love. Mrs. Atwood\u0027s very existence became a rather annoying trifle--a pin-prick that only occasionally smarted. \n \n When Mrs. Atwood met the Chesters she was beginning to feel desperate. Her last three letters to Sidney were unanswered. When she happened to hear Mrs. Chester say he was to be their guest so shortly, she felt that the hand of destiny was outstretched on her behalf. She promptly set to work to extract an invitation from Mr. Chester, and having succeeded, felt that all would happen as she had pictured. She was convinced that they only needed to meet once more when their relations would be as they had been in the past--only more so. \n \n \"Take ship, for happiness is somewhere to be had,\" she quoted to herself. She was sure that her happiness lay at Pinnels End, and embarked upon her enterprise with a high heart. \n \n By Saturday evening, the night of the Primrose meeting, the situation was somewhat as follows: Mrs. Atwood, still striving vainly to secure a few minutes alone with Sidney Ballinger; he, moving heaven and earth to draw Lallie away from all the others, without success; Lallie, quite aware of the tactics of both Ballinger and Mrs. Atwood and mischievously delighting in the checkmate of each in turn. She infuriated Mrs. Atwood by her extreme graciousness to Ballinger in public, and drove him to desperation by her desire for Billy Chester\u0027s society whenever he hoped to get her to himself. \n \n Mrs. Chester was furious with Mrs. Atwood. She invaded her husband\u0027s dressing-room just before dinner to voice her indignation. \n \n \"I have no patience with the woman,\" she exclaimed; \"she\u0027s a regular spoil-sport. Any one with half an eye or an ounce of sympathy can see how the land lies between Lallie and young Ballinger, and yet she never leaves them alone for an instant. She seems to me to follow them about on purpose.\" \n \n \"I think you\u0027re a bit hard on her. She must go about with some one, you couldn\u0027t expect her to stop in her room; and after all, how can she divine that Lallie and Ballinger are in love? They\u0027re too well-bred to show it if they are, and you have only your supposition to go on. I think she has taken rather a fancy to Lallie, like the rest of us.\" \n \n \"Fancy!\" Mrs. Chester repeated scornfully. \"If there is one person in this house that Mrs. Atwood cordially dislikes, it\u0027s Lallie. Mark my words, she means mischief, though how or why I can\u0027t tell; but I am convinced that she got you to ask her here simply that she might meet Sidney Ballinger--and I wish I\u0027d never seen her.\" \n \n The Pinnels party went in an omnibus to the Primrose meeting in Fareham. Ballinger secured a seat next Lallie, and under cover of the general conversation demanded: \n \n \"Why will you never give me a minute alone? Why do you seem to avoid me so?\" \n \n \"Why, I\u0027m with you all day long, it seems to me; and as I\u0027ve nothing to say to you that mightn\u0027t be shouted from the housetops, why should solitude be necessary?\" \n \n \"I have a great deal to say to you that couldn\u0027t possibly be shouted. Will you come for a walk to-morrow afternoon? I\u0027m sure you don\u0027t sleep all Sunday afternoon. Will you promise? And without that chap, Chester, mind--just you and me.\" \n \n \"What about your friend Mrs. Atwood? She may be fond of walking.\" \n \n \"Confound her! Will you promise?\" \n \n \"I can\u0027t promise, but I\u0027ll try; there! Only you must be amusing and agreeable.\" \n \n \"I\u0027m only too afraid of being amusing. You generally seem to find me that. I should like you to take me very seriously indeed--I beg your pardon, Mrs. Atwood, what did you say?\" \n \n The Primrose meeting was well attended. A noble earl, chief landowner in the neighbourhood, made a speech which mainly consisted of \"hems\" and \"ers\" interspersed with platitudes about Empire and Tariff Reform. The unionist candidate spoke wittily and well, and certain local magnates said the things local magnates usually do say. Then came the lighter part of the evening\u0027s business--songs and recitations. Lallie sang her topical ditty with immense flair. She looked so small, and slim, and young in her really beautiful French frock, with pearls in her hair and round her slender throat, that the hearts of the audience went out to her before she opened her mouth. But when she did begin to sing, when the big rich voice rolled out the ridiculous words with the marvellously clear articulation that was one great charm in Lallie\u0027s singing, she made every point with an archness that was delicious, that seemed to take each member of the audience into her confidence, while that confidence implied entire trust in their general shrewdness and clear-sightedness. \n \n At the triumphant conclusion the whole house rose at her and demanded an encore with such noise and persistency that there was nothing for it but to indulge them. \n \n The organist of Fareham Church presided at the piano as accompanist, and they saw him seemingly protest or expostulate at the song she gave him, but Lallie was evidently peremptory, and it was to be that or nothing. When she came forward to the front of the platform there was a sudden silence as, without any prelude, very softly, every note clear and poignantly sad, there fell upon the astonished ears of that comfortable English company: \n \n \"Oh, Paddy, dear, and did you hear the news that\u0027s \n going round?\" \n \n \n Not one word could be missed or misunderstood. \n \n \"I met with Napper Tandy, and he tuk me by the hand, \n And, says he, \u0027How\u0027s poor old Ireland, and how does \n she stand?\u0027\" \n \n \n How, indeed? A little uncomfortable doubt as to their dealings with that most distressful country assailed even the most cock-sure politician in that audience. \n \n \"Oh, the wearing of the green,\" sang Lallie, her heart in her voice. The monotonous, melancholy tone, charged full in every measured cadence with the sorrow of a people, held the good Fareham folk against their wills. \n \n The clever Conservative candidate sat forward in his chair on the platform, his elbow on his knee, his hand shading his keen eyes as he stared fixedly at the little figure who worked this strange miracle. \n \n It was over. \n \n Fareham took a long breath and ventured upon subdued applause. For a moment there was a perceptible and uncomfortable pause. Then Billy Chester leapt to his feet and saved the situation. \n \n \"He was glad,\" he said, \"that the lady who had just been delighting them with her great gift of song had reminded them of Ireland and her wrongs. One thing above all others was needed to right those wrongs; to set Ireland in her place among the kingdoms of the Empire; to give her prosperity, self-respect, and peace within her own borders. This remedy they had in their hands if they would only use it--the institution of a judicious system of Tariff Reform. For no part of the Empire would it do so much as for Ireland.\" Billy showed how it could be brought about. He quoted statistics by the yard, he made jokes, he put Fareham on good terms with itself again, and the meeting broke up with a special vote of thanks to Miss Clonmell for her delightful music. \n \n \"Lallie, you horrid little Fenian, what on earth possessed you to sing that song to-night of all nights?\" Mrs. Chester demanded as they drove home. \n \n \"It seemed to me,\" Lallie replied grimly, \"that there was an intolerable deal of sack to very little bread throughout the proceedings. So I thought I\u0027d give them a little bread--black bread and bitter, but wholesome.\" \n \n \"But for Billy it might have been very awkward indeed,\" Mrs. Chester continued. \n \n \"Perhaps,\" Mrs. Atwood suggested, \"that natural instinct of the artist to make a sensation at all costs was too strong for Miss Clonmell. She certainly attained her object. The faces of the people were an interesting study.\" \n \n No one spoke for a moment, but Mrs. Chester, who was sitting next Lallie, suddenly felt for the girl\u0027s hand under the rug and gave it an affectionate squeeze. \n \n \"You\u0027re a sad pickle,\" she whispered, \"you always were.\" \n \n \"I must speak up for my country when I get the chance,\" Lallie said aloud. \"It isn\u0027t often I find myself upon a political platform, but I really believe I could sway the multitude better than most of them. If only I\u0027d danced an Irish jig, I believe I could have got the whole of them to vote for Home Rule.\" \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1778/51831.html","bookId":1107,"book":{"id":1107,"title":"Master and Maid","description":"简介： On the second Friday of term Anthony Bevan, whom all his world called Bruiser Bevan, Housemaster of B.
