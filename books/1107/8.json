{"id":22214,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER VIII","content":"As Lallie was late for breakfast Tony only saw her for a few minutes before he had to go to College. He did not get back to the house again till nearly lunch time, when he met her at the front door, radiant, smiling, her arms full of books. \"See, Tony!\" she exclaimed joyously. \"I\u0027ve been into the town--such a pretty town it is too, with a band playing in the promenade and all. And I found a library, and I\u0027ve paid my subscription for three months; three volumes at a time; and I\u0027ve chosen three books, and here they are!\" Tony followed her into the hall and Lallie held up the books, backs outwards, for his inspection. \"How did you choose them?\" he asked. \"Well, I chose this one because there was such a pretty lady in the front, and I liked the cover. And I chose this one because I\u0027ve read other books by the same author, and liked them. And I chose this one because the very nice lady at the library pressed it upon me and said it was \u0027being very much read.\u0027 \"Only one good reason, Lallie, out of the three. I\u0027m afraid that pretty cover, with the pretty lady inside, is misleading. I, in my character of chaperon----\" \"As Uncle Emileen, you mean, Tony?\" \"Exactly so. I, in my character of Uncle Emileen, must veto that one, though I haven\u0027t read it myself. I\u0027m pretty sure your father wouldn\u0027t like it.\" \"I\u0027m quite sure he wouldn\u0027t, if you say so. He\u0027s awfully particular, is Dad; but he\u0027s particular in a funny sort of way. He\u0027ll let me read things that would make the hair of the entire Emileen family stand straight on end--if only they are sincere and well written; and then again, he falls foul of wishy-washy novels that Aunt Emileen would consider quite harmless.\" \"I don\u0027t think he would consider this either well-written or sincere, so you\u0027d better give it to me.\" \"Dad says \u0027tis women mostly who write the dirty books--what a pity! But I think he must be wrong, don\u0027t you, Tony?\" Tony shook his head mournfully. \"A great pity,\" he repeated. \"I expect they do it just for the fun of shocking people. I like doing that myself.\" \"I\u0027ve no doubt of it. All the same, I hope you\u0027ll choose some other method of scandalising society; and you\u0027d better hand that particular volume over to me.\" \"And here have I walked all the way up from the town, fondly clasping that pernicious volume--Aunt Emileen\u0027s phrase, not mine--and lots of people stared hard at me, and I thought it was my nice new hat they were admiring. Here, take it, Tony, and you can come with me to return it, and then they\u0027ll think I got it for you, you old sinner.\" Tony glanced nervously around lest there should be any eavesdropper to hear him called an \"old sinner\"; but the doors were all shut and the hall empty. \"Certainly I\u0027ll come with you to-morrow; I couldn\u0027t possibly come to-day, I was so busy. Why are you always in such a hurry, Lallie? I subscribe to that library; no one ever gets out any books except Miss Foster; and there you go paying another subscription. What waste! And why did you go by yourself?\" \"And who was there to go with, pray? P--Mr. Johns was in College. You were in College. I don\u0027t know where Mrs. Wentworth was, but anyway I didn\u0027t meet her.\" \"What about Miss Foster?\" \"Miss Foster went out while I was practising, and when she came in, I went out. Sort of \u0027Box and Cox,\u0027 you know.\" \"Try and go with Miss Foster to-morrow, Lallie, it would be so much better.\" Lallie had already started to go upstairs; she paused about six steps up and leant over the banisters to look at Tony, exclaiming reproachfully: \"But you promised you\u0027d go with me yourself to-morrow!\" \"So I will, but other days--remember.\" Lallie went up three more steps, and again paused and looked down. \"For a dear, kind, nice, middle-aged man, Tony, you\u0027re rather obtuse,\" she said. And with this cryptic speech she ran up the whole flight of stairs and vanished from his sight. What could the child mean? Lallie had made up her mind overnight that she would not bother Tony with any complaints about Miss Foster, so she did not tell him that directly after breakfast that lady had suggested to her that she should practise \"while I am out of the house.\" Nor had Miss Foster made any suggestion that Lallie should accompany her during her morning\u0027s shopping. When Miss Foster came in, Lallie went out; and having in the meantime come to the conclusion that she must find amusement for herself and in no way depend upon her hostess, she found her way into the town and to the library. By the end of a week Miss Foster had made it abundantly clear to every one concerned, except the busy and optimistic master of the house, that she felt no desire whatever for the society of Lallie Clonmell. By mutual consent they kept out of each other\u0027s way as far as was possible. Miss Foster took every opportunity of letting Lallie see that she had no intention of acting the part of Aunt Emileen towards her; and whatever Tony might be, Lallie was not obtuse. Subtly, but none the less unmistakably, did Miss Foster impress upon her that to be the chaperon of stray young ladies did not come within the scope of the duties which she had undertaken to fulfil at B. House. She never offered to take the girl anywhere except to chapel or to the football field, where it was practically impossible that they should go separately. Moreover, Miss Foster considered it a real grievance that during the services in chapel, Lallie persisted in singing psalms, canticles, and hymns with her usual brio and enthusiasm; and the wonderfully sweet, full voice caused many upward glances at the gallery reserved for the masters\u0027 families. Lallie had philosophically determined to make the best of a difficult situation; but like that friend of Dr. Johnson, who \"would have been a philosopher but that cheerfulness kept breaking in,\" so, in her case, cheerfulness made extraordinarily frequent irruptions in the shape of the older boys and younger masters to an extent that sometimes threatened to be indecorously hilarious. Not once had Miss Foster invited Lallie to accompany her when she went shopping in the morning. In fact, her daily suggestion after breakfast that her guest should \"get her practising over before lunch\" had become a sort of ritual. Thus it came about that Lallie took to going out by herself between twelve and one, the fashionable hour for promenading in Hamchester; and invariably her steps were bent towards the very promenade she had so admired on her first visit to the library. Tony, who generally played fives or coached football teams after morning school until lunch time, was under the impression that she was safe in Miss Foster\u0027s care; nor had he the remotest idea that Fitzroy Clonmell\u0027s cherished only daughter, who had never in her life before walked unattended in the streets of a town, tripped off alone every morning to sun herself in the famous Hamchester promenade, where the band plays daily and the idle and well-dressed inhabitants walk up and down, gossip, or flirt as best pleases them. The promenade at Hamchester is a long, straight street; very wide, possessed of a really fine avenue of trees, with shops on one side, and on the other public gardens and a terrace of tall Georgian dwelling-houses. The library made an excellent object for Lallie\u0027s daily walk, and if she reached the promenade unattended, she was not long permitted to stroll along in mournful solitude. Before she had been three weeks in Hamchester she knew every prefect in the whole alphabet of College houses, and for prefects, the promenade was not out of bounds. The gallant Cripps, no longer in quarantine, often found his way thither, to the despair of the fives-playing community. Berry, head prefect of B. House, had strained a muscle in his shoulder, and was off games for the time being, and he also fell in with Lallie with surprising frequency; and if it so happened that no boys she knew were \"down town\" between twelve and one, \"young Nick\" was almost certain to fly into town on a bicycle, which he recklessly left outside a shop while he walked up and down, and discussed the Celtic Renaissance or more frivolous topics with this sweet-voiced, frank, and friendly Irish maid. From the very beginning Mrs. Wentworth had done her best for Lallie in the way of asking her to lunch and to tea, but she had a houseful of visitors during the girl\u0027s first weeks under Tony Bevan\u0027s roof, and had really very little time for outsiders. She had gauged pretty accurately Miss Foster\u0027s mental attitude towards Lallie; but when Miss Foster declared to her that she \"accepted no responsibility whatever with regard to Miss Clonmell,\" little Mrs. Wentworth thought that this was only \"Miss Foster\u0027s way\"; and never dreamt that the lady could or would evade a relationship towards her young guest that seemed natural and inevitable. Therefore it came upon Mrs. Wentworth with quite a shock when three mornings running in succession, while doing the ever-necessary shopping, she came upon Lallie leisurely strolling up and down the promenade, a tall youth on either side of her, all three manifestly with no sort of object in their stroll except the society of one another; and wherever Lallie was, \"cheerfulness kept breaking in\": in this case the attendant swains laughed with a heartiness and vigour that caused most passers-by to regard the trio attentively. Small and upright; clad in an admirably fitting suit of Lincoln green--she was very fond of green--with trim short skirt that liberally displayed her slim ankles and very pretty feet, she would have been noticeable even without her hilarious escort; and Mrs. Wentworth, whose motherliness in no way stopped short at Pris and Prue, acted promptly and without hesitation. From the steps of a shop she watched the gay green figure and attendant swains pass, walk to the end of the avenue, turn and come back again, when Mrs. Wentworth descended into the arena and met Lallie face to face. \"Lallie, how fortunate! You are the very person I most wanted at this moment. How do you do, Mr. Berry! I hope your shoulder is less painful? Good morning, Mr. Cripps. Lallie, do come with me and help me to choose linen for the children\u0027s smocks. You have such a good eye for colour.\" Lallie dismissed her companions with a cheerfully decided \"Don\u0027t wait for me, either of you; I\u0027ll be ages. And I want to walk home with Mrs. Wentworth.\" The two ladies vanished into a shop, and Cripps and Berry were left outside, looking rather foolish and disconsolate. \"D\u0027you think she cut in on purpose?\" asked Cripps. \"Highly probable,\" said Berry. \"I thought this sort of game was a bit too hot to last. I confess I\u0027ve often wondered Germs or old Bruiser didn\u0027t put a stop to it.\" \"Germs\" was Miss Foster\u0027s nickname amongst the boys. \"Germs hates her; any one can see that.\" \"All the more reason for her to interfere on every possible occasion, I should have thought.\" \"My dear chap,\" said Berry in superior tones, \"you only perceive the obvious. I confess I can\u0027t make out Germs. She\u0027s anxious enough to interfere as a rule, but about Miss Clonmell, I\u0027m hanged if I can see what she\u0027s playing at. It\u0027s a deep game, anyhow. She\u0027d give her eyes to get rid of her; I\u0027d stake my oath on that. Poor little girl! It must be jolly dull shut up all day with old Germs. However, we\u0027ll continue to do our best for her, anyhow.\" \"I jolly well shall,\" said Cripps, and he said it with the air of one who registers a solemn vow. Mrs. Wentworth and Lallie chose the linen for the smocks: light blue, the colour of her eyes, for Pris, dark blue for Prue; and Lallie\u0027s favourite green for Punch. She insisted on being allowed to make the one for Punch herself, and was so keenly interested and absorbed by the whole affair that Mrs. Wentworth found it very hard to broach the subject she had most at heart. The girl was so frankly affectionate, so manifestly delighted to be with her friend again, that the kindly lady suffered pangs of self-reproach that she had not made time somehow to see more of her. In considering young people generally, Mrs. Wentworth was in the habit of saying to herself, \"Suppose it were Pris or Prue\"; and it was marvellous how lenient in her judgment this supposition always made her. As they left the town behind them and reached the quiet road leading to B. House, she took the bull by the horns, saying: \"Lallie, dear, do you think your father would like you to walk up and down the promenade all alone at the very busiest time?\" \"But I\u0027m hardly ever alone, dear Mrs. Wentworth. I may say never. I always meet one or two of the boys or somebody, and we walk up and down together.\" Lallie so evidently considered her explanation entirely satisfactory, and turned a face of such guileless innocence and affection towards her mentor, that Mrs. Wentworth found it difficult to go on with her sermon. However, she steeled her heart and continued: \"That\u0027s just it, my dear; I fear he wouldn\u0027t like it at all.\" \"Not like me walking with the boys? Oh, you\u0027re really quite wrong there; he meant me to be friends with the boys, that\u0027s why he sent me to Tony. He thinks all the world of the boys, and I agree with him; such a dear nice set they are. Don\u0027t you think so yourself, Mrs. Wentworth?\" \"I do, I do, indeed,\" Mrs. Wentworth heartily assented; \"but--the promenade of a large town is not quite the proper place for you to meet the boys, and I am sure that there your father would agree with me.\" \"Would you rather I walked with them in the country roads? I\u0027m quite willing. I\u0027m by no means wedded to the promenade. The trombone in the band played rather out of tune to-day, and it jarred me dreadfully. We\u0027ll go into the country next time.\" \"No, no, that wouldn\u0027t do at all. Lallie, I\u0027m afraid--I\u0027m very much afraid--that you oughtn\u0027t to walk about with the boys at all unless I or Miss Foster or Mr. Bevan can be with you.\" \"Dear Mrs. Wentworth, would you rather I went about with the young masters?\" Lallie asked sweetly. \"They\u0027ve really got more time, and I like them nearly as well. I\u0027ll tell one of them to come country walks with me if you prefer it.\" \"Certainly not,\" Mrs. Wentworth said decidedly. \"You mustn\u0027t do that on any account----\" \"Then where am I to walk?\" Lallie interrupted piteously. \"Round and round the College field? And it\u0027s often so wet. I must get some exercise.\" \"Of course you must,\" Mrs. Wentworth concurred heartily. \"You must come out with me; and sometimes, perhaps, you\u0027ll take out the children: they love you so dearly. But what you must not do--I really mean it--is to walk up and down that promenade as you were doing to-day\"--Mrs. Wentworth said nothing about the other days--\"because, rightly, or wrongly, the nicest girls here don\u0027t do it; and as you are so very nice I can\u0027t let you. Lallie I don\u0027t want to be interfering and tiresome, but don\u0027t you think it would look better--it would at all events be natural and right as you are both in the same house--if you sometimes went about with Miss Foster?\" Lallie sighed deeply. \"I was in quarantine when I came,\" she said, \"and it seems to me that I\u0027ve never got rid of the infection. But I\u0027ll try to do as you say, for you\u0027re a dear darling and I love you; but it seems to me that unless I can hire an aeroplane and go up alone in that, I\u0027m certain to meet somebody, and they always turn and go back with me.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1778/51820.html","bookId":1107,"book":{"id":1107,"title":"Master and Maid","description":"简介： On the second Friday of term Anthony Bevan, whom all his world called Bruiser Bevan, Housemaster of B.
