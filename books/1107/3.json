{"id":22209,"no":3,"title":"CHAPTER III","content":"Lallie woke with a start, a great bell was clanging--it seemed to her in the middle of the night--then she realised where she was, remembered that Paddy had told her the rising bell rang at seven, and turned over and went to sleep again, only to be awakened by another bell, equally loud, an hour later. \\n\\n \\n\\n This time Lallie sat up in bed, pushed her hair out of her eyes, and looked about her. A long shaft of sunlight stretched across the room through the gap made by a green blind that did not exactly fit its window. The windows were open, and a gay little breeze moved the blinds gently to and fro. Miss Foster\u0027s room was large and stately and handsomely furnished; but somehow it lacked individuality: it was impossible to divine, even to make a guess at Miss Foster\u0027s characteristics from her bedroom. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She must be a paragon of tidiness,\" thought Lallie; \"but perhaps that\u0027s Ford. After all, the woman can\u0027t leave things about when she\u0027s away, so I won\u0027t hate her for that. I wonder what she\u0027d say if some one showed her one of those gazing crystals and she beheld me lying here in her bed!\" Lallie smiled as she pictured Miss Foster\u0027s astonishment, and perhaps some thought of the same kind occurred to Ford, who at that moment appeared bearing a breakfast tray, for she gave vent to a little sound, as she crossed the room, that might have been mistaken for a suppressed giggle had not her appearance been so severely servant-like and respectful. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mr. Bevan sent his kind regards, miss, and hopes as you\u0027re rested; and he says you\u0027re not to get up, but take it quietly this morning after such a long journey. Shall I pull up your blinds, miss, or would you prefer the shaded light?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Ford shot out the words all in one breath, and deposited the tray on a little table beside the bed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Pull them all up, Ford. Oh, what a beautiful morning! Give Mr. Bevan my love and say I slept beautifully; and Miss Foster\u0027s bed, and Miss Foster\u0027s room, and the view from Miss Foster\u0027s windows, and everything that is hers is charming.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Ford waited in respectful silence till she had settled the tray on Lallie\u0027s knees. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027ll give me a hand with backs and things, won\u0027t you, Ford? Nearly all my frocks fasten behind--\u0027tis the stupid fashion of the present day, but it can\u0027t be helped. I\u0027m afraid I shall make a good deal more work for you, Ford, but Daddie said I was to tell you he\u0027ll make it worth while at Christmas. You see, we didn\u0027t know whether T--whether Mr. Bevan would have room for Bridget; she\u0027s my old nurse, and she does everything for me at home, but she\u0027s a bit difficult with other servants. Do you think you\u0027ll be able to manage for me, Ford?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I shall be very pleased to do my best, miss,\" said Ford demurely. \"You see, I\u0027m private parlourmaid; I\u0027ve nothing to do with the young gentlemen\u0027s part of the \u0027ouse, and Miss Foster requires very little waiting on----\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, dear!\" sighed Lallie; \"not like me, but I\u0027ll try and be tidy in my room. Madame made me be that though Bridget spoiled me. Now don\u0027t let me be keeping you; I\u0027ll ring when I want to get up and you\u0027ll come and show me the bath-room.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n When Ford reached the kitchen region again, she remarked to the cook: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know what it is about that young lady--she\u0027s not much to look at--but there\u0027s something about her that makes you want to do every mortal thing she wants the minute she\u0027s as\u0027t you--I think it must be her voice, it\u0027s that funny and weedlin\u0027.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Cripps, the captain of the College fives, was in quarantine for mumps. An inconsiderate little sister had developed this disease two days after his return to school, and his mother being honest and considerate had hastened to inform Tony of the fact by telegram. Hence, Cripps, in rude health and the very worst of tempers, was removed from the society of his fellows to the drear seclusion of the sick-room by night and of the garden by day, or such parts of the neighbourhood as were in bounds, while the boys were in College. The rest of the inhabitants of Hamchester might take their chance. But Cripps, that morning, felt no inclination for a walk; savage and solitary he armed himself with a deck-chair and the \"Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,\" and sat him down under an elm at the edge of the tennis lawn nearest that side of B. House which contained Miss Foster\u0027s room. Thus it came about that Lallie, having with the assistance of Ford arrayed herself in a white cambric frock, dismissed that excellent handmaid, and leaning out of the window beheld Cripps. \\n\\n \\n\\n A boy--a big boy, with broad shoulders and a brown face and hair that stood up on end in front; a boy lying in a deck-chair and reading a novel at eleven o\u0027clock on a Saturday morning. Lallie was devoured by curiosity. What was that boy doing there? Was he some old Hamchestrian staying in the house? No; he looked too youthful for that. Why was he not in College with the others? \\n\\n \\n\\n Cripps turned a page and yawned widely, showing his white even teeth. \\n\\n \\n\\n The September sun was hot and he felt sleepy. \"The probity of parents sets the children\u0027s teeth on edge,\" said Cripps to himself, with a vague idea that he was quoting Scripture. He laid Sherlock Holmes face downwards on his knee and closed his eyes. What a long morning it had been! Might the maledictions of all righteous men fall upon that most mischievous of trivial diseases called mumps! Why had no doctor discovered the mump microbe and taken steps to stamp out the whole noxious tribe? They were footling fellows these doctors on the whole; all this trouble arose from the idiotic habit little girls have of kissing one another. Probably his little sister had kissed some wretched pig-tailed brat who was--Cripps had almost forgotten his wrongs in slumber when he was startled by a full sweet voice which carolled---- \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Captain, art tha\u0027 sleeping down below?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Cripps sat up very straight and looked about him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why are you not in College?\" the voice asked again. \\n\\n \\n\\n Cripps looked up in the direction of the voice and leapt to his feet. Sherlock Holmes fell neglected on the grass. \\n\\n \\n\\n Lallie was leaning out of the window just above him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I beg your pardon,\" he exclaimed politely; \"I didn\u0027t know you were there.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Naturally, for you were asleep. Now how comes it that you were falling asleep in the middle of the morning? That\u0027s what I want to know. Are you stopping with T--with Mr. Bevan too?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Cripps longed to pose as a visitor, but honesty, like many worse things, is sometimes hereditary, so he hung his head and mumbled dismally: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, I\u0027m one of the chaps; but I\u0027m in quarantine--for mumps of all beastly silly diseases. I know I shan\u0027t have it, too.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Poor boy,\" said Lallie sympathetically, \"I hope you won\u0027t. I\u0027ve had it, and it\u0027s horrible. Paddy brought it back from here once and gave it to me. It seems to me that the boys in this house are always having something.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We don\u0027t have half as many things as the other houses,\" Cripps retorted indignantly, \"and I haven\u0027t got it, it\u0027s my beastly little sister----\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now that\u0027s not nice of you,\" said Lallie reprovingly, \"to speak of the poor little girl like that; no mortal could want mumps. But I don\u0027t think I can keep bawling to you from here. I\u0027ll come down if you can ferret out another chair--not a mumpy one, mind--and I\u0027ll try and bring you to a more Christian frame of mind.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She vanished from the window and Cripps flew to the summer house to fetch one of Tony\u0027s most luxurious garden chairs, feeling that for once the fates had not dealt unkindly with him when they put him in quarantine. \\n\\n \\n\\n Across the lawn towards him came Lallie, swinging a green silk bag. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do you like your feet up?\" asked the gallant Cripps. \"There\u0027s a piece that pulls out.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Thank you--it would be a pity to waste these shoes, wouldn\u0027t it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And Lallie subsided into a long chair which supported her very pretty feet, shod in shiny shoes with buckles and Louis Quinze heels. From the green silk bag she drew forth a roll, which proved to be lace, and she began to sew diligently. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What pretty work!\" said Cripps, drawing up his chair to face hers. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s a strip of Limerick lace I\u0027m making, and I\u0027ve just got to a \u0027basket.\u0027 The light\u0027s good, so I thought I\u0027d do it this morning.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"May I see it close?\" asked Cripps, wishing she would look at him instead of at her lace, though black eyelashes resting on rounded cheeks are by no means a disagreeable prospect. \\n\\n \\n\\n This morning Lallie was not so pale. Her cheeks were never really rosy, but they were fresh, with a delicate, fault colour like the inside of certain shells. She held out the roll of work towards Cripps, and he took hold of one end while she unpinned the other and spread out the lace. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"By Jove!\" said Cripps, but it was not at the lace he was looking so much as at Lallie\u0027s hand. Such an absurd small hand compared to his; so white, with beautiful pink filbert-shaped nails. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s pretty, isn\u0027t it?\" said Lallie, of her lace. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Awfully,\" said Cripps. \"Whatever size do you take?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How d\u0027you mean? You don\u0027t make lace in sizes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I beg your pardon, I was thinking of your hands. Look at them--compared to mine!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now don\u0027t you be reproaching me with being so little. It\u0027s no fault of mine nor no wish; I\u0027ve done my best to grow, but it\u0027s no use. I\u0027m the only little person in a tall family, and it\u0027s very out-of-date for a girl to be small nowadays. I\u0027m a sort of survival of the obsolete, and if I live to be old, I\u0027ll be looked upon as a sort of rarity, and people will come miles to see me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I should think people do that now,\" said Cripps, still keeping tight hold of the lace. \\n\\n \\n\\n Lallie let go her end of it and looked at him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now that\u0027s very kind of you to say that--really kind and nice. I wonder if all your family are exceptionally good-looking, because, if so, perhaps you can sympathise with me. Are they?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, no, I don\u0027t think they are,\" Cripps said, getting very red. \"I really have never thought about it; one doesn\u0027t, you know, with one\u0027s own people.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027d have to if you were like me,\" Lallie sighed. \"Dad is tremendously good-looking; so\u0027s Paddy--don\u0027t you think so?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ye-e-e-s,\" Cripps answered, without enthusiasm, \"I suppose he is; but one doesn\u0027t notice that sort of thing much in fellows----\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think it\u0027s their noses that make them so distinguished,\" Lallie continued meditatively. \"Dad\u0027s and Paddy\u0027s, I mean. Now, my nose begins well, it does really--but it changes its character half way; and it\u0027s got a confiding tip, and that isn\u0027t in the least distinguished. My only consolation is, it isn\u0027t often red.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think it\u0027s an extremely neat nose,\" Cripps said, with convincing sincerity. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Neat, but not gaudy! Ah, well, it\u0027s the best I\u0027ve got, anyway, and I can smell anything burning in the kitchen quicker than most people. But all the same, I think it must be very agreeable to be so good-looking that people want to please you just because of it, without you doing anything at all. That\u0027s the way with Dad and Paddy. Now ordinary folks like you and me--I hope you don\u0027t mind rowing in the same boat with me?--have to be nice to people if we want them to like us.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is Paddy Clonmell your brother?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My twin brother, but we\u0027re not a bit alike, even in disposition, though we\u0027re the best of friends and I adore him. What are you celebrated for, and I\u0027ll see if I can\u0027t tell you your name; I\u0027ve heard about most of you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Cripps blushed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m afraid I\u0027m not celebrated at all,\" he said modestly. \"I\u0027m only in Upper V.; I don\u0027t suppose you\u0027ve ever heard of me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Lallie laid down her work and looked at Cripps critically. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll try again,\" she said. \"Are you a College colour?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Cricket?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, no, I\u0027m no good at all.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Football?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Fives?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then you\u0027re two, and that\u0027s very grand; and I think,\" said Lallie slowly, her eyes wandering from her companion\u0027s face to the book lying on the grass and back again--\"then I think you must be Mr. Cripps, the captain of the College fives. Now aren\u0027t I a witch of a guesser?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Distinctly gratified, Cripps duly expressed surprise at her discernment. Lallie\u0027s sight was good, and she had seen his name on the paper copy of Sherlock Holmes lying on the grass. They continued to chat happily till morning school was over, and Tony Bevan rushed back to B. House to see after his guest. She saw him coming and flew to meet him, crying: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, Tony, I\u0027ve been so happy in your garden, and Mr. Cripps has been so kind and nice, and has entertained me all the morning. It\u0027s been very pleasant having him to talk to.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Tony smiled down at the radiant upturned face. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You don\u0027t look a bit tired this morning, Lallie,\" he said, \"and I\u0027m glad you\u0027ve not been dull; but I\u0027d forgotten all about Cripps, and I\u0027m not sure that you ought to have been talking to him at all. He\u0027s contraband, you know, a suspect----\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He told me all about it, Tony; and I\u0027ve had the silly thing, and we were out of doors, so it couldn\u0027t matter, now could it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Get your hat on now, Lallie, you are going to lunch with Mrs. Wentworth, the Principal\u0027s wife; I\u0027ve seen her about you and she has kindly promised to mother you as much as possible till Miss Foster comes back.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Lallie\u0027s face fell. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, Tony,\" she exclaimed, \"can\u0027t I have lunch with you and all the boys this first day? Can\u0027t I stop here just for to-day?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027ll have lunch here hundreds of times, and I\u0027ve made the engagement for you to-day. Hurry, my child, for I haven\u0027t a minute.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Lallie didn\u0027t take long to get her hat--a big white one. She also wore a pair of long white gloves, and still carried the green silk bag, the only touch of colour about her. Tony looked at her with kind, approving eyes. How well the child carried herself; how girlish and fresh she was; and in her own quaint way, how full of the distinction she thought she lacked. But he felt some misgivings all the same--was she so unnoticeable? that was the question. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How did you manage to find Cripps?\" he asked, as they hurried up the wide tree-bordered road leading from B. House to the College, now full of boys hurrying to and fro from their various houses. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I saw him from the window, and he was nearly asleep, so I called to him and he looked up; he\u0027s such a nice kind boy--we\u0027re great friends already.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, are you?\" Tony said, rather drily. \"Where was Matron?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I haven\u0027t seen the dear matron this morning; you see, I went straight out whenever I was dressed. Oh, I did enjoy my lazy lie this morning, Tony, but I\u0027ll be up with the lark to-morrow.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you think you\u0027d be better to breakfast in bed until you have got thoroughly rested?\" Tony said nervously. \"There\u0027s no need for you to get up, and it makes such a long morning. Hadn\u0027t you better breakfast in bed till----\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Miss Foster comes back, I suppose,\" snapped Lallie. \"Why would you be hiding me out of sight all the time, Tony? Are you ashamed of me?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She stood still in the middle of the road, flushed and angry. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My dear child, ashamed!\" the worried Tony repeated. \"What an extraordinary idea! don\u0027t stand there, Lallie, the boys are staring at you. Doesn\u0027t it prove how anxious I am to show you off to my friends that I haven\u0027t lost a minute in introducing you to the chief lady of our community?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry I was cross, Tony, but somehow, ever since I came, I\u0027ve felt that you felt I oughtn\u0027t to be here; that--well, that I\u0027m in a kind of way in quarantine, like poor Cripps, and that only Miss Foster\u0027s return will remove the infection.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Lallie, you\u0027re too sharp altogether; you\u0027re not so far out though this time, and I begin to sympathise with your father\u0027s introduction of Aunt Emileen. But I promise you you\u0027ll be happy this afternoon; and this evening I\u0027ll bring my work into the drawing-room beside you. I must do it, but you won\u0027t feel lonely if I\u0027m there, will you? No, Lallie, you must not try to embrace me in the street! the boys are looking at you!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Who\u0027s trying to embrace you, you conceited man? I was only taking your arm, and that you might have offered me. I promised Matron I wouldn\u0027t try to kiss you any more here.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Promised Matron! What the dickens has Matron got to do with it?\" It was Tony who stopped this time, and his voice was the reverse of pleased. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, dear, oh, dear! you\u0027re like the animals in \u0027Alice,\u0027 Tony, there\u0027s no pleasing you at all, at all. May I point out that at the present moment several boys are looking at you!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But, Lallie, you must explain what you mean; you say such extraordinary things----\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not at all, it\u0027s all the other way; but I\u0027ll try and remember to be stiff and prim; only one minute you\u0027re so nasty and the next you\u0027re so nice that action of some sort seems imperative--oh, dear, we\u0027re there! What a big house! Is she terrible, Tony? Will she think I\u0027m all mumpy too? You won\u0027t leave me; you\u0027ll see me safe in----\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1778/51815.html","bookId":1107,"book":{"id":1107,"title":"Master and Maid","description":"简介： On the second Friday of term Anthony Bevan, whom all his world called Bruiser Bevan, Housemaster of B.
