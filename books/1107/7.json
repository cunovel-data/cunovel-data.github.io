{"id":22213,"no":7,"title":"CHAPTER VII","content":"An hour later Tony sat at his study table offering sacrifices propitiatory to parental anxiety amid clouds of smoke, with a pile of unanswered letters at his elbow. \n \n Lallie peeped in. \n \n \"Has she come, Tony?\" she whispered. \n \n \"She has,\" he remarked briefly, whereupon Lallie vanished again, with a muttered exclamation. \n \n In the passage she met Mr. Johns on his way to take prep.; she seized him by the arm, whispering beseechingly: \n \n \"Come with me to the drawing-room just for a minute, there\u0027s a dear kind man. I\u0027m petrified with terror, and Tony\u0027s busy. Don\u0027t leave me to go in all by myself.\" \n \n \"Certainly not,\" Mr. Johns replied reassuringly; \"I can\u0027t stay, I\u0027m afraid, but I\u0027ll come into the drawing-room with you with pleasure. If it\u0027s the dark you\u0027re afraid of, and it soon gets dark now, I\u0027ll turn on the light; it\u0027s just inside the door.\" \n \n Lallie gave a smothered laugh, but nevertheless she kept a tight hold of Mr. Johns till he had opened the drawing-room door and turned on the light. Then she drew her hand from his arm and sailed into the room with her head in the air. The room was untenanted. \n \n \"She\u0027s not here at all,\" Lallie said blankly; then to the somewhat flustered young master who had followed her in: \"I\u0027ll not detain you further, Mr. Johns,\" she remarked airily; \"I know you are much occupied. It was kind of you to show me the way.\" \n \n Somewhat huffed at this abrupt dismissal after so effusive a greeting, Mr. Johns swung round hastily, only to cannon with considerable violence against Miss Foster, who, unheard by him, had just entered the room. Lallie stood magisterially upon the hearthrug while they disentangled themselves, and Mr. Johns muttered apologies which were loftily ignored by the lady. \n \n Miss Foster was intensely annoyed. No one appears to advantage who has just been vigorously humped into by an International forward; and although Miss Foster\u0027s ample form was calculated both to sustain and repel a considerable impact, she was distinctly ruffled. \n \n Mr. Johns almost banged the door behind him. \n \n \"I hope he didn\u0027t hurt you, the clumsy fellow,\" exclaimed Lallie, in sweetly sympathetic tones, as she came forward with outstretched hand. \"I must introduce myself, dear Miss Foster, and apologise for invading B. House in your absence.\" \n \n \"I suppose you are but a bird of passage,\" Miss Foster remarked, when she had given Lallie\u0027s hand a limp and chilly shake. \n \n \"That depends,\" said Lallie gaily, \"whether you\u0027re all very good to me or not. If I like it, I may stay till Dad comes back from India. He likes me to be with Tony.\" \n \n \"I wonder,\" Miss Foster said thoughtfully, when she had seated herself, \"whether your father has fully considered Mr. Bevan\u0027s many responsibilities. A house like this--\" Miss Foster paused. \n \n \"It seems a comfortable house,\" Lallie suggested helpfully, \"though \u0027tis a bit cold. Shall I set a match to the fire?\" and Lallie flew to the little table--but the matches were gone. \n \n \"Pray don\u0027t,\" Miss Foster exclaimed, \"I never start fires before the first of October.\" \n \n \"But if it\u0027s cold?\" Lallie expostulated. \n \n \"That, Miss Clonmell, is my invariable rule.\" \n \n \"But it might be warm on the first of October.\" \n \n \"If it is warm on the first of October I shall certainly not have a fire.\" \n \n \"But we\u0027ve had a fire every night since I came.\" \n \n \"I thought the room smelt rather stuffy,\" Miss Foster said coldly. \"Won\u0027t you sit down, Miss Clonmell? You look so uncomfortable standing there.\" \n \n Lallie sat down obediently, and unconsciously folded her hands in the devout attitude in which she had been wont to listen to the discourses of the Mother Superior in her convent. \n \n \"It would be well,\" Miss Foster continued, in a head voice, \"if, before we go any farther, I explain to you how rigid--necessarily rigid--rules must be in a house of this description. It will save trouble and futile argument afterwards. You must see, yourself, that the arrangements in a College boarding-house containing fifty boys and over a dozen servants can\u0027t chop and change; the ordinary routine can\u0027t be relaxed as in an ordinary private house--though in the best managed private houses things are almost equally regular.\" \n \n \"But why should people be colder in a College house than in any other sort, if they can afford a fire?\" Lallie persisted. \"Tony liked the fire.\" \n \n \"I never argue,\" Miss Foster observed, with superior finality; \"we will change the subject. How is your brother getting on at Woolwich? I hope he is settling down well.\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t know about \u0027settling,\u0027 Miss Foster, we\u0027re not a very settled family, but he\u0027s well and happy, and the dearest boy. Didn\u0027t you think him a dear boy, and isn\u0027t he good to look at?\" \n \n \"From what I remember of your brother he was quite good-looking--fair, wasn\u0027t he? You are not in the least like him.\" \n \n \"No, indeed, more\u0027s the pity,\" Lallie said simply. \"He is the image of Dad. You\u0027ve met my father, I think, Miss Foster?\" \n \n \"I believe your father stayed a night here some time last winter, but I don\u0027t remember him very distinctly. We see so many parents, you know, and it\u0027s hard to keep them separate in one\u0027s mind unless they have very definite qualities, or are distinguished people.\" \n \n \"Most people think Dad is very distinguished,\" said Lallie, much incensed at the implied slight upon her father; \"but I suppose he appeals most to brilliant people like himself. May I have my work-bag, Miss Foster? I think you are sitting on it, and I may as well get on with Tony\u0027s tie as sit here doing nothing. Thank you; I hope no needle has run into you.\" \n \n Silence fell upon the twain: a fighting silence, charged with unrest. \n \n Dinner that night was not exactly a hilarious meal. Mr. Johns still smarted under a sense of injury at the trick he considered Lallie had played him. He held her responsible for his collision with Miss Foster, and he came to table determined not to address a single word to her till she should apologise. All the time he was mentally rehearsing that apology and the form it should take. In some solitude--place not yet specified--she would ask him what she had done to offend him. Reluctantly he would allow her to drag from him the real cause of his aloofness, and through the veil of his reticence she would perceive the enormity of her offence--veils have an enlarging effect. Being really good at heart and full of generous impulses--he was certain of Lallie\u0027s generosity--she would frankly apologise, and he would, as frankly, refuse to allow her to do so. Mr. Johns saw himself, muscular, large, and magnanimous, in the very flower of his young English manhood--gently and imperceptibly raising little Lallie\u0027s moral tone until her soul should reach the altitude upon which it could meet his on equal terms. After that, who knows what might happen? And it was dinner time. \n \n At table, however, he couldn\u0027t harden his heart against Lallie, who sat opposite in a high white blouse that made her look like a schoolgirl. Her eyelids were pink; so was her nose with its confiding tip; and she never once looked across at Mr. Johns. \n \n Miss Foster would discuss the dates of various quarantines, and the preventative measures that should be taken if any of the usual infectious diseases invaded the other houses. Tony tried in vain to head her off to other topics. By the time they had reached the contagious, or non-contagious nature of tonsilitis, Lallie began to look about her. From time to time she caught Tony\u0027s eyes, and her own were so merry and well amused that Tony, himself, began to see another side to the germ question, which as a rule bored him to extinction. Mr. Johns found himself trying to intercept some of Lallie\u0027s glances, but without success; and when the meal came to an end he had assuredly not addressed a single remark to Lallie, but it was from lack of opportunity and not because he was any longer offended. How could one be offended with an irresponsible creature whose dimples were so bewitching? \n \n Tony retired to his study; Mr. Johns went back to the boys; and Lallie, who longed to go with Tony but didn\u0027t dare, meekly followed Miss Foster into the drawing-room. Tony was troubled about Lallie. The child look pinched and low-spirited, he thought, and she was such a good child. She had tried so hard, so kind-hearted Tony assured himself, to fall in with their ways, to keep rules and regulations that were all strange to her. He wished he could have her in here with him, but he supposed it wouldn\u0027t do; Miss Foster might be offended. She was such a quiet little mouse--it was pleasant to work by the fire with her leaning against his knees, with one of those everlasting ties in her hands. By Jove! it was a cold night; he\u0027d light his fire. Poor little Lallie! would Miss Foster be friendly and motherly? He hoped to goodness she wouldn\u0027t talk any more about illnesses; he felt rather as though he were going to have mumps himself. Tony pressed his neck on both sides anxiously. The wood sparkled and crackled, he drew his chair up to the fire and lit his pipe. \n \n \"You must excuse me, Miss Clonmell,\" said Miss Foster, when they reached the drawing-room; \"I have many things to see to upstairs. In a house like this it is impossible to devote one\u0027s whole evening to social intercourse. I fear I must leave you for half an hour or so.\" \n \n \"Of course,\" Lallie said solemnly, not quite knowing why. \"Please, Miss Foster, would it disturb any of the children--the boys, I mean--if I play the piano while you\u0027re gone?\" \n \n \"The boys\u0027 part of the house is quite separate; you may disturb Mr. Bevan, who is usually busy at this time--but----\" \n \n \"Oh, I shan\u0027t disturb Tony; he\u0027ll probably leave his door open to hear me; he loves music.\" \n \n \"He has not, hitherto, made any parade of his partiality,\" Miss Foster said coldly, and left the room, shutting the door carefully after her. \n \n Lallie flew across to the door and opened it wide, gazing after Miss Foster\u0027s portly form ascending the staircase. \n \n \"In a house like \u0027this,\u0027\" said Lallie to herself, and made a face, \"St. Bridget herself would lose patience, and I very much fear there\u0027s more than a spice of the devil in me. Anyway, I\u0027m not going to freeze for twenty Miss Fosters; I\u0027ll get a cloak to cover me.\" \n \n She ran upstairs and reappeared clad in a wonderful theatre coat of rose-coloured satin, embroidered in silver, a most incongruous garment considering the severe simplicity of her frock, but it appeared to give her great satisfaction; and again leaving the door wide open she seated herself \"with an air\" at the piano, and began to sing. \n \n It was surprising that so small and slight a creature as Lallie could have such a big voice--a rich, carrying mezzo soprano voice; the sort of voice usually associated with the full-bosomed, substantially built women that one encounters on concert platforms or in grand opera. \n \n Portali, the great singing-master in Paris to whom her father had taken her when she was seventeen, explained it thus: \n \n \"She sings as a bird sings, but she would never make a public singer. She hasn\u0027t the physique, she hasn\u0027t the industry; above all, she hasn\u0027t the temperament; but she can sing now as no amount of training could ever make her. Give her good lessons--occasionally--but only the best; never let any provincial teacher come near her. If she ever has a bad illness she\u0027ll probably lose her voice altogether, but if she only sings for pleasure--for her own, and yours, and that of the fortunate people thrown with her, never as a business--she may keep it till she is quite an old woman. Let her choose her own songs--Folk songs are what she can sing--but let her sing what she pleases; she will never go wrong. Let her keep her wild-bird voice; don\u0027t try to tame or train it too much.\" \n \n Lallie began to sing very softly \"Synnove\u0027s Lied\"--the andante that is sung as if humming to one\u0027s self; then suddenly she let her voice go. \"Oh to remember the happy hours!\" Right through the house it rang, passionate, pathetic, pleading. \n \n Tony leapt to his feet and opened his study door; at the same instant he heard some one prop open the swing door that shut off the study passage from his part of the house, and down the long corridor every door was opened. \n \n \"Our world was bounded by the garden trees, \n Then came the churchyard and the river.\" \n \n \n The big, beautiful voice died down, and once more came the quaint humming refrain. Again--musical, intensely melancholy--the voice rang out. \n \n \"But now the garden is white with snow, \n At night I wait, I stand and shiver,\" \n \n sang Lallie most realistically, for the drawing-room really was rather cold. \n \n \"The place is frosty, the cold winds blow, \n Oh love, my love, but you come never.\" \n \n Lallie sang in English, for she could not speak Norwegian, and every word was clearly enunciated and distinct; the soft humming refrain followed, and died away into silence. \n \n \"Heavens!\" thought Tony, \"the child is homesick alone in there with Miss Foster; she sounds cold too--this is dreadful!\" \n \n He hurried to the drawing-room, expecting to find Lallie in the tearful state her pathetic voice had indicated. \n \n \"I thought that would bring you,\" Lallie remarked complacently. \"Come here, Tony, and admire my theatre coat Dad brought me from Paris.\" \n \n Tony stood where he was, staring at the gorgeous little figure seated perkily on the piano stool; at the big cheerless room, with one electric light burning in dismal prominence over the piano; at the black and chilly hearth. \n \n \"Why in the name of all that\u0027s idiotic haven\u0027t you got a fire?\" he asked angrily. \n \n \"In this house,\" Lallie replied, in Miss Foster\u0027s very tones, \"we never have fires till the first of October.\" \n \n Poor Tony looked very miserable. \n \n \"I am so sorry,\" he said helplessly; \"you\u0027d better come and sit in my study. I have a fire.\" \n \n \"It\u0027s I who ought to be sorry, Tony, worrying you like this. It was horrid of me to tell tales. No, I won\u0027t come and sit in your study, for that would only make her hate me the more. I\u0027m not a bit cold in my beautiful coat, and I\u0027ll go on making music quite happily. Run away back to your little exercise books.\" \n \n \"Try not to take a dislike to Miss Foster at the very first, Lallie,\" Tony pleaded. \"She\u0027s a good sort really; and perhaps I ought to have written to tell her you had come.\" \n \n \"It would have been better to break it to her gently,\" Lallie responded drily. \n \n Tony crossed the room slowly, pausing on the threshold. \n \n \"I fear I must ask you to keep the door shut; the boys heard you singing, and instantly every study door was opened.\" \n \n \"Ah, the dears!\" cried Lallie delighted. \"Do let me have them all in, and I\u0027ll sing them something they\u0027d really like.\" \n \n Tony shook his head. \n \n \"They must do their work, and I must do mine. Mind, you are to come into the study if you are cold.\" \n \n As Tony crossed the hall even the shut door could not drown the cheerful strains of that most jubilant of jigs, \"Rory O\u0027More,\" and he felt a wild impulse to dance a pas seul there and then. However, he sternly fastened the swing door, shut himself into his study, and tried to forget the brilliant little rose-and-silver figure with the wistful Greuze face. Over his mantel-piece hung an engraving of \"La cruche cassée,\" bought some years ago because of its likeness to Lallie. He shook his head at it now, turned his back upon it, and sat down at his table. Val, who liked music, went to the door and whined to get out, but Tony unsympathetically bade him get into his basket again, and gave his own attention to the bundles of white paper that Lallie had impertinently dubbed \"little exercise books.\" \n \n When Miss Foster returned Lallie was singing \"All round my hat I will wear a green garland,\" and accompanying herself upon the harp. She finished the song and then went and sat beside Miss Foster on the sofa. \n \n \"You have a very strong voice, Miss Clonmell,\" Miss Foster remarked, gazing with astonished disfavour at the rose-and-silver garment. \n \n \"So I\u0027ve always been told,\" said Lallie. \"You see it has never been strained.\" \n \n \"Did you say trained or strained?\" \n \n Lallie laughed. \n \n \"Oh, it\u0027s plenty of training it\u0027s had, but perhaps I haven\u0027t profited as much as I might have done. Are you fond of music, Miss Foster?\" \n \n \"I can\u0027t say that I am. I dislike every sort of loud music, and all stringed instruments seem to me so very thrummy.\" \n \n To this Lallie made no reply, but took her roll of lace out of her bag and began to work in perfect silence. Miss Foster picked up the Spectator and tried to read it, but could not concentrate her attention. Against her will she was forced to glance from time to time at the quiet figure beside her; at the deft white hands that moved so swiftly and silently; at the beautiful work that grew so fast beneath their ministrations. Like Tony, Lallie\u0027s silence irritated her. If only the girl had chattered she would have had a grievance. \n \n \"You were out with Mrs. Wentworth this afternoon, I think you said?\" Miss Foster remarked at last. \n \n \"Yes, Miss Foster; she took me to see Pris and Prue at their dancing. Oh, it was lovely! Pris is just like a big soft india-rubber ball, and bounds up and down in perfect time, and looks the incarnation of gleeful enjoyment. And then Mrs. Wentworth insisted on my going back to tea with her, for they were arranging about the Musical Society, and she thought I might help. The organist is a nice man! That\u0027s how it was I couldn\u0027t be here to welcome you.\" \n \n \"The practises are a great nuisance,\" Miss Foster said. \"The boys have so much to do, it really is not fair to make them practise in their scanty playtime.\" \n \n \"But music\u0027s good for them,\" argued Lallie; \"and it\u0027s not a mental strain.\" \n \n \"Of that I am by no means sure. If you will excuse me, Miss Clonmell, I think I will retire, for I\u0027ve had rather a tiring day.\" \n \n Miss Foster rose, Lallie folded her work neatly and put it in her bag. She went and shut the piano and came back and shook hands with her hostess. \n \n \"Good-night, Miss Foster. I may be a minute after you, for I promised Mr. Bevan I\u0027d go and say good-night to him in the study;\" and before Miss Foster could recover from her amazement at this audacious statement Lallie had vanished. \n \n \"She\u0027s worse than anything I ever dreamt of,\" poor Miss Foster lamented to herself; \"and I fear she\u0027s a fixture for the present; anyway, we shall see.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1778/51819.html","bookId":1107,"book":{"id":1107,"title":"Master and Maid","description":"简介： On the second Friday of term Anthony Bevan, whom all his world called Bruiser Bevan, Housemaster of B.
