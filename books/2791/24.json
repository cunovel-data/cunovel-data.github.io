It\u0027s a job Jeffrey takes VERY seriously. Six feet four inches, 220 fatless lbs., black hair, and blue eyes;weapon of choice: the 9 mm Beretta. In a pinch? His fists. IQ: 157. (Yes, crossword puzzle, in ink, just after taking out the guy behind you. No thanks necessary.) No one ever sees Jeffrey Rodinov coming, and no one--not even a mouthy, illegitimate princess--is going to keep him from playing bodyguard when his king decrees it. \\n Right. But no Rodinov ever had to protect Princess Nicole Krenski. Her credentials? Hunting guide in the Alaskan wilderness. Smart. Stubborn bordering on exasperating. Five-seven. Blue eyes. Very kissable mouth. Very kissable neck, back, legs, wrists, earlobes. The lady says she doesn\u0027t need a bodyguard, but that\u0027s where she\u0027s wrong. Someone needs to watch her and show her the royal ropes (and cuffs. . .and scarves. . .). Someone who can make her feel like a queen--in and out of bed. And that\u0027s a job Jeffrey Rodinov takes very seriously as well. . .\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-royal-mess-alaskan-royal-family-3.jpg","author":"MaryJanice Davidson","type":"Humorous","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-royal-mess-alaskan-royal-family-3.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:23 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:35:42 PM"}}
