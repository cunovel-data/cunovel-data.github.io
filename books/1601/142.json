A globe of light appeared nearby, a soft blue aura, much dimmer than that of a lantern. It had been created by a woman with dark skin and very refined features. Delicate. A small nose, a slender frame. She stood up from her crouch, and Egwene found her to be quite tall, nearly as tall as a man. \"You are a dangerous little rabbit\", the woman said, her thick, toneless accent making her difficult to understand. She emphasized words in the wrong places, and pronounced many sounds in a just-off way. She had the tattoos on her face, like delicate branches, reaching from the back of her neck forward onto her cheeks. She also wore one of those dresses shaped like a cow’s bell, black, with strands of white tied a handspan below the neck. The woman touched her arm, where Egwene’s knife had nearly taken her. \"Yes\", the woman said, \"very dangerous. Few of the Ayyad would reach for a dagger so quickly, rather than for the Source. You have been trained well\". Egwene struggled in her bonds. It was no use. They were tight. Her heart began racing, but she was better than that. Panic would not save her. She forced herself to be calm. No, she thought. No, panic won’t save me . . . but it may alert Gawyn. She could sense that he was worried, out there somewhere in the darkness. With effort, she allowed her terror to rise. She let go of all of her careful Aes Sedai training. It was not nearly as easy as she had expected. \"You move quietly, little rabbit\", the Sharan woman said, inspecting Egwene. \"I would never have been able to follow you if I hadn’t already known you were moving in this direction\". She walked around Egwene, looking curious. \"You watched the Wyld’s little show all the way through, did you? Brave. Or stupid\". Egwene shut her eyes and focused on her terror. Her sheer panic. She had to bring Gawyn to her. She reached within, and opened the tight little nugget of emotion she’d packed there. Her fear at being captured again by the Seanchan. She could feel it. The a’dam on her neck. The name. Tuli. A name for a pet. Egwene had been younger then, but no more powerless than she was now. It would happen again. She would be nothing. She would have her very self stripped away. She would rather be dead. Oh, Light! Why couldn’t she have died? She’d sworn she’d never be captured like this again. She began to breathe quickly, now unable to control her terror. \"Now, now\", the Sharan said. She seemed amused, though her tone was so flat, Egwene couldn’t completely tell. \"It won’t be that bad now, will it? I have to decide. Which will gain me more? Turning you over to him, or keeping you for myself? Hmm . . \". Strong channeling came suddenly from the far side of the camp, where Demandred had gone. The Sharan glanced that way, but didn’t seem alarmed. Egwene could feel Gawyn approaching. He was very worried. Her message had served its purpose, but he wasn’t coming quickly enough, and he was farther away than she’d expected. What was wrong? Now that she’d let her worry out of its hidden place, it overwhelmed her, beating against her, a series of blows. \"Your man . . \". the Sharan said. \"You have one of them. What are they called, again? Odd, that you should rely on the protection of a man, but you never reach your potential in this land, I am told. He will be taken. I’ve sent for him\". As Egwene had feared. Light! She’d led Gawyn to this. She’d led the army to disaster. Egwene squeezed her eyes shut. She’d led the White Tower to its destruction. Her parents would be slaughtered. The Two Rivers would burn. She should have been stronger. She should have been smarter. No. She had not been broken by the Seanchan. She would not be broken by this. Egwene opened her eyes and met the gaze of the Sharan in the soft blue light. Egwene wrestled her emotions to stillness, and felt the Aes Sedai calm envelop her. \"You . . . are an odd one\", the Sharan whispered, still held by Egwene’s eyes. So transfixed was she that the woman didn’t notice when the shadow moved up behind her. A shadow that could not have been Gawyn, for he was still distant. Something smashed into the woman’s head from behind. She crumpled, slumping to the ground. The globe winked out instantly, and Egwene was free. She dropped to a crouch, fingers finding her knife. A figure moved up to her. Egwene raised her knife and prepared herself to embrace the Source. She would draw attention if she had to. She would not be taken again. But who was this? \"Hush\", the figure said. Egwene recognized the voice. \"Leilwin?\" \"Others noticed this woman channeling\", Leilwin said. \"They will come to see what she was doing. We must move!\" \"You saved me\", Egwene whispered. \"You rescued me\". \"I take my oaths seriously\", Leilwin said. Then, so softly that Egwene could barely hear it, she added, \"Maybe too seriously. Such horrible omens this night . . \". They moved quickly through the camp for a few moments, until Egwene sensed Gawyn approaching. She couldn’t make him out in the darkness. Finally, she whispered softly, \"Gawyn?\" Suddenly, he was there, right next to her. \"Egwene? Who did you find?\" Leilwin stiffened, then hissed softly through her teeth. Something seemed to have upset her greatly. Perhaps she was angry at having someone sneak up on her. If that was the case, Egwene shared the emotion. She’d been taking pride in her abilities, and then she’d been blindsided not only by a channeler, but now by Gawyn! Why should a boy raised in the city be able to move so well without her spotting him? \"I didn’t find anyone\", Egwene whispered. \"Leilwin found me . . . and she pulled me out of a fire\". \"Leilwin?\" Gawyn said, peering through the darkness. Egwene could feel his surprise, and his suspicion. \"We must keep moving\", Leilwin said. \"I will not argue with that\", Gawyn replied. \"We’re almost out. We’ll want to go a little to the north, though. I left some bodies just to the right\". \"Bodies?\" Leilwin asked. \"Half a dozen or so Sharans jumped me\", Gawyn said. Half a dozen? Egwene thought. He made it sound as if it were nothing. This was not the place for discussion. She joined the other two, heading out of the camp, Leilwin leading them in a specific direction. Each noise or shout from the camp made Egwene wince, worried that one of the bodies had been found. In fact, she nearly jumped all the way to the storm clouds above when someone","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-142.html","bookId":1601,"book":{"id":1601,"title":"A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14)","description":"Storyline: A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14) “And it came to pass in those days, as it had come before and would come again, that the Dark lay heavy on the land and weighed down the hearts of men, and the green things failed, and hope died.” From Charal Drianaan te Calamon, The Cycle of the Dragon.
