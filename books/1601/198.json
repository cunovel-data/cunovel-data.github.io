With the lightning, the Trolloc drums in the near distance, the occasional raids by Shadowspawn trying to slip into camp . . . soldiers knew to be wary. The frosted air smelled of smoke, with putrid scents blowing in from the Trolloc camps.\\n\\n She eventually gave up the hunt and walked back the way she had come, finding Cadsuane speaking with a group of soldiers. Aviendha was about to approach when her eyes passed over a patch of darkness nearby, and her senses came alert. That patch of darkness is channeling.\\n\\n Aviendha began weaving a shield immediately. The one in the darkness wove Fire and Air toward Cadsuane. Aviendha dropped her weave and instead lashed out with Spirit, slicing the enemy weave just as it was released.\\n\\n Aviendha heard a curse, and a quick weave of fire blossomed in her direction. Aviendha ducked as it lashed overhead, hissing in the cold air. The wave of heat passed. Her enemy ducked out of the shadows—whatever weave she’d been using to hide had collapsed—revealing the woman Aviendha had fought before. The one with the face almost as ugly as a Trollocs.\\n\\n The woman dashed behind a group of tents just before the ground ripped up behind her—a weave that Aviendha hadn’t made. A second later, the woman folded again, as she had before. Vanishing.\\n\\n Aviendha stood warily. She turned toward Cadsuane, who walked up to her. \"Thank you\", the woman said, grudgingly. \"For disrupting that weave\".\\n\\n \"I suppose we are even, then\", Aviendha said.\\n\\n \"Even? No, not by several hundred years, child. I will admit that I am thankful for your intervention\". She frowned. \"She vanished\".\\n\\n \"She did that before\".\\n\\n \"A method of Traveling we do not know\", Cadsuane said, looking troubled. \"I saw no flows for it. Perhaps a ter’angreal? It—\"\\n\\n A shot of red light rose from the front lines of the army. The Trollocs were attacking. At the same time, Aviendha felt channeling in different spots around the camp. One, two, three . . . She spun about, trying to locate each of the locations. She counted five.\\n\\n \"Channelers\", Cadsuane said sharply. \"Dozens of them\".\\n\\n \"Dozens? I sense five\".\\n\\n \"Most are men, fool child\", Cadsuane said, waving a hand. \"Go, gather the others!\"\\n\\n Aviendha dashed away, yelling the alarm. She would have words with Cadsuane later for ordering her about. Maybe. \"Having words\" with Cadsuane often left one feeling like a complete fool. Aviendha ran into the Aiel section of camp in time to see Amys and Sorilea pulling on their shawls, checking the sky. Flinn stumbled out of a nearby tent, blinking bleary eyes. \"Men?\" he said. \"Channeling? Have more Asha’man arrived?\"\\n\\n \"Unlikely\", Aviendha said. \"Amys, Sorilea, I need a circle\".\\n\\n They raised eyebrows at her. She might be one of them now, and she might have command by the Car’a’carn\u0027s authority, but reminding Sorilea of that would end with Aviendha buried to her neck in sand. \"If you please\", she added quickly.\\n\\n \"It is your say, Aviendha\", Sorilea said. \"I will go and speak with the others and send them to you, so you may have your circle. We will make two, I think, as you have suggested before. That would be for the best\".\\n\\n Stubborn as Cadsuane, that one is, Aviendha thought. The two of them could teach lessons on patience to trees. Still, Sorilea was not strong in the Power—in fact, she could barely channel—so it would be wise to use others as she suggested.\\n\\n Sorilea began calling for the other Wise Ones and Aes Sedai. Aviendha suffered the delay with anxiety; already, she could hear screams and explosions in the valley. Streams of fire arced into the air, then dropped.\\n\\n \"Sorilea\", Aviendha said softly to the elder Wise One as the women began to build the circles, \"I was attacked in camp just now by three Aiel men. The battle we are about to fight, it will probably involve other Aiel who fight for the Shadow\".\\n\\n Sorilea turned sharply, meeting Aviendha’s eyes. \"Explain\".\\n\\n \"I think they must be the men we sent to kill Sightblinder\", Aviendha said.\\n\\n Sorilea hissed softly. \"If this is true, child, then this night will mark great toh for us all. Toh toward the Car’a’carn, toh toward the land itself\".\\n\\n \"I know\".\\n\\n \"Bring me word\", Sorilea said. \"I will organize a third circle; maybe make some of those off-duty Windfinders join in\".\\n\\n Aviendha nodded, then accepted control of the circle as it was handed to her. She had three Aes Sedai who had sworn to Rand and two Wise Ones. By her order, Flinn did not join the circle. She wanted him to be on the watch for signs of men channeling, ready to point the direction, and being in a circle might make that impossible for him to do.\\n\\n They moved off like a squad of spear-sisters. They passed clusters of Tairen Defenders pulling on burnished breastplates over uniforms with wide striped sleeves. In one group, she found King Darlin bellowing orders. \"A moment\", she said to the others, hastening to the Tairen.\\n\\n \" . . . them all!\" Darlin said to his commanders. \"Don’t let the front lines weaken! We can’t let those monsters spill into the valley!\" It appeared that he’d been awakened from sleep by the attack, for he stood dressed only in trousers and a white undershirt. A disheveled serving man held out Darlin’s coat, but the King, distracted by a messenger, turned away.\\n\\n When Darlin saw Aviendha, he waved her forward urgently. The serving man heaved a sigh, lowering the coat.\\n\\n \"I’d given up on them attacking tonight\", Darlin said, then glanced at the sky. \"Or, well, this morning. The scout reports are so confused, I feel like I’ve been thrown into a coop full of crazed chickens and told to catch the one with a single black feather\".\\n\\n \"Those reports\", Aviendha said, \"do they mention Aiel men, fighting for the Shadow? Possibly channeling?\"\\n\\n Darlin turned sharply. \"It’s true?\"\\n\\n \"Yes\".\\n\\n \"And the Trollocs are pushing with everything they have to force their way into the valley\", Darlin said. \"If those Aiel Dreadlords start attacking our troops, we won t stand a chance without you lot being there to hold them off\".\\n\\n \"We’re moving\", Aviendha said. \"Send for Amys and Cadsuane to make gateways. But I warn you. I caught a Dreadlord sneaking around \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-198.html","bookId":1601,"book":{"id":1601,"title":"A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14)","description":"Storyline: A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14) \\n “And it came to pass in those days, as it had come before and would come again, that the Dark lay heavy on the land and weighed down the hearts of men, and the green things failed, and hope died.” From Charal Drianaan te Calamon, The Cycle of the Dragon. \\n In the Field of Merrilor the rulers of the nations gather to join behind Rand al’Thor, or to stop him from his plan to break the seals on the Dark One’s prison—which may be a sign of his madness, or the last hope of humankind.
