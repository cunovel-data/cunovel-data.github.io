I do not think it a wise choice\".\n Egwene, oddly, said nothing. Perrin studied her. He’d have thought that she’d jump at the chance to lead the war herself.\n \"It should be one of us\", Darlin said. \"Chosen from those who would go to battle here\".\n \"I suppose\", Rand said. \"So long as you all know who is in command, I will cede this point. You must meet my other demands, however\".\n \"You still insist that you must break the seals?\" Egwene said.\n \"Do not worry, Egwene\", Moiraine said, smiling. \"He is not going to break the seals\".\n Rand’s face darkened.\n Egwene smiled.\n \"You are going to break them\", Moiraine said to Egwene.\n \"What? Of course I’m not!\"\n \"You are the Watcher of the Seals, Mother\", Moiraine said. \"Did you not hear what I said earlier? ‘It shall come to pass that what men made shall be shattered, and the Shadow shall lie across the Pattern of the Age, and the Dark One shall once more lay his hand upon the world of man . . .’ It must happen\".\n Egwene seemed troubled.\n \"You have seen this, have you not?\" Moiraine whispered. \"What have you dreamed, Mother?\"\n Egwene didn’t respond at first.\n \"What did you see?\" Moiraine pressed, stepping closer to her.\n \"His feet crunching\", Egwene said, staring Moiraine in the eyes. \"As he strode forward, Rand’s feet stepped on the shards of the Dark One’s prison. I saw him, in another dream, hacking away at it to open it. But I never actually saw him opening it, Moiraine\".\n \"The shards were there, Mother\", Moiraine said. \"The seals had been broken \"\n \"Dreams are subject to interpretation\".\n \"You know the truth of this one. It does need to be done, and the seals are yours. You will break them, when the time is right. Rand, Lord Dragon Reborn, it is time to give them to her\".\n \"I don’t like this, Moiraine\", he said.\n \"Then not much has changed, has it?\" she asked lightly. \"I believe you have often resisted doing what you are supposed to. Particularly when I am the one to point it out to you\".\n He paused for a moment, then laughed, reaching into the pocket of his coat. He slipped out three discs of cuendillar; each split by a sinuous line down the center. He set them on the table.\n \"How will she know the time?\" he asked.\n \"She will\", Moiraine said.\n Egwene smelled skeptical, and Perrin didn’t blame her. Moiraine always had believed in following the weave of the Pattern and bowing to the Wheel\u0027s turnings. Perrin didn’t see it that way. He figured you made your own path, and trusted in your own arms to do what needed to be done. The Pattern wasn’t a thing to depend on.\n Egwene was Aes Sedai. It seemed that she felt she should see it as Moiraine did. Either that, or she was willing to agree and just take those seals into her hands. \"I’ll break them, when I feel it must be done\", she said, taking the seals.\n \"You\u0027ll sign, then\". Rand took the document as the clerks protested the hastiness with which they’d had to work. It now had several additions on the back. One of the clerks cried out, reaching for the sand, but Rand did something with the One Power, drying the ink instantly as he placed the document before Egwene.\n \"I will\", she said, holding out a hand for a pen. She read the provisions carefully, the other sisters looking over her shoulders. They nodded one at a time.\n Egwene put pen to paper.\n \"And now the rest\", Rand said, turning to measure reactions.\n \"Light, he’s grown clever\", Faile whispered beside Perrin. \"Do you realize what he did?\"\n \"What?\" Perrin said, scratching his beard.\n \"He brought with him all he knew would support him\", Faile whispered. \"The Borderlanders, who would sign practically anything to garner help for their homelands. Arad Doman, which he helped most recently. The Aiel . . . well, all right, who knows what the Aiel will do at a given time? But the idea stands.\n \"Then he let Egwene gather the others. It’s genius, Perrin. That way, with her bringing this coalition against him, all he really had to do was convince her. Once he swayed her to his side, the others would look foolish to stand apart\".\n Indeed, as the rulers began to sign—Berelain going first and most eagerly—those who had supported Egwene started to fidget. Darlin stepped up and took the pen. He hesitated for a moment, then signed.\n Gregorin followed. Then the Borderlanders, each in turn, followed by the King of Arad Doman. Even Roedran, who still seemed to find this entire thing a fiasco, signed. Perrin found that curious.\n \"He blusters a lot\", Perrin said to Faile, \"but he knows this is good for his kingdom\".\n \"Yes\", she said. \"He’s been acting a buffoon partially to throw everyone off, make them dismiss him. The document outlines current borders of nations to remain as they are\", Faile said. \"That’s a huge boon to someone trying to stabilize his rule. But . . \"\n \"But?\"\n \"The Seanchan?\" Faile said softly. \"If Rand persuades them, does that allow them to keep the countries they have now? The women who are damane, are they allowed to slap one of those collars on any woman who passes their border?\"\n The tent stilled; perhaps Faile had spoken more loudly than she’d intended. Perrin sometimes had trouble remembering what ordinary people could and couldn’t hear.\n \"I will deal with the Seanchan\", Rand said. He stood over the table, watching as each ruler looked over the document, spoke with the counselors they’d brought, then signed.\n \"How?\" Darlin asked. \"They do not wish to make peace with you, Lord Dragon. I do think they’ll make this document meaningless\".\n \"Once we are done here\", Rand said softly, \"I will go to th \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-59.html","bookId":1601,"book":{"id":1601,"title":"A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14)","description":"Storyline: \n A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14) \n “And it came to pass in those days, as it had come before and would come again, that the Dark lay heavy on the land and weighed down the hearts of men, and the green things failed, and hope died.” From Charal Drianaan te Calamon, The Cycle of the Dragon. \n In the Field of Merrilor the rulers of the nations gather to join behind Rand al’Thor, or to stop him from his plan to break the seals on the Dark One’s prison—which may be a sign of his madness, or the last hope of humankind.
