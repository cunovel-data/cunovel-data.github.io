This gateway will take you into the dream. Take care, Perrin. If you die in that place while in the flesh, it can have . . . ramifications. What you face could be worse than death itself, particularly now. At this time\". \"I know\", Perrin said. \"I will need a way out. Can you have one of your Asha’man make one of these gateways once a day, at dawn? Say, at the Traveling grounds of Merrilor?\" \"Dangerous\", Rand whispered. \"But I will do it\". Perrin nodded in thanks. \"The Light willing, we will see one another again\", Rand said. He held out his hand to Perrin. \"Watch out for Mat. I’m honestly not sure what he’s going to do, but I have a feeling it will be highly dangerous for all involved\". \"Not like us\", Perrin said, clasping Rand’s forearm. \"You and I, we’re much better at keeping to the safe paths\". Rand smiled. \"May the Light shelter you, Perrin Aybara\". \"And you, Rand al’Thor\". Perrin hesitated, and realized what was happening. They were saying goodbye. He took Rand in an embrace. \"You take care of him, you two\", Perrin said, looking toward Nynaeve and Moiraine as he pulled back from the embrace. \"You hear me?\" \"Oh, now you want me to watch after Rand?\" Nynaeve said, hands on hips. \"I don’t believe I ever stopped, Perrin Aybara. Don’t think I didn’t hear you two whispering over there. You’re doing something foolish, aren’t you?\" \"Always\", Perrin said, raising a hand in farewell to Thom. \"Gaul, you certain you want to do this?\" \"I am\", the Aielman said, loosening his spears and looking through Rand’s gateway. Without another word, the two hefted their heavy packs and stepped into the World of Dreams. CHAPTER 14 Doses of Forkroot \"Light . . . \" Perrin whispered to Gaul, looking across the landscape. \"It’s dying\". The boiling, thrashing, churning black sky of the wolf dream was nothing new, but the storm that the sky had been foreshadowing for months had finally arrived. Wind blew in enormous gusts, moving this way, then that, in unnatural patterns. Perrin closed his cloak, then strengthened it with a thought, imagining the ties holding it to be fixed strongly in place. A little bubble of calmness extended out from him, deflecting the worst of the winds. It was easier than he anticipated, as if he’d reached for a heavy piece of oak and found it as light as pine. The landscape seemed less real than it usually did. The raging winds actually smoothed out hills, like erosion at high speed. In other places, the land swelled up, forming ripples of rock and new hillsides. Chunks of earth sprayed into the air, shattering. The land itself was coming apart. He grabbed Gaul’s shoulder and shifted the two of them away from the place. It was too close to Rand, Perrin suspected. Indeed, as they appeared on the familiar plain to the south—the place where he’d hunted with Hopper—they found the storm less powerful. They stowed their heavy packs, laden with food and water, in a thicket of bushes. Perrin didn’t know if they could survive on food or water found in the dream, but he didn’t want to have to find out. They should have enough here for a week or so, and as long as they had a gateway waiting for them, he felt comfortable—or, at least, satisfied—with the risks he was taking here. The landscape here wasn’t coming apart in the same way as it had been near Shayol Ghul. However, if he watched a section long enough, he could catch bits of . . . well, everything being pulled up in the winds. Stalks of dead grain, fragments of tree trunks, gobs of mud and slivers of rock—all were slowly being pulled toward those gluttonous black clouds. After the way of the wolf dream, when he looked back, things that had been broken apart would often be whole again. He understood. This place was being consumed, slowly, as was the waking world. Here, it was simply easier to see. The winds whipped at them, but weren’t so strong that he had to keep them at bay. They felt like the winds at the beginning of a storm, right before the rain and lightning. The heralds of oncoming destruction. Gaul had pulled the shoufa over his face, and looked about suspiciously. His clothing had changed in shade to match the grasses. \"You have to be very careful here, Gaul\", Perrin said. \"Your idle thoughts can become reality\". Gaul nodded, then hesitantly unveiled his face. \"I will listen and do as instructed\". It was encouraging that Gaul’s clothing didn’t change too much as they walked through the field. \"Just try to keep your mind clear\", Perrin said. \"Free of thought. Act by instinct and follow my lead\". \"I will hunt like the gara\", Gaul said, nodding. \"My spear is yours, Perrin Aybara\". Perrin walked through the field, worried that Gaul would accidentally send himself somewhere by thinking of it. The man barely suffered any effects of the wolf dream, however. His clothing would change a little if he was startled, his veil snapping into place without him reaching for it, but that seemed to be the extent of it. \"All right\", Perrin said. \"I’m going to take us to the Black Tower. We hunt a dangerous prey, a man named Slayer. You remember Lord Luc?\" \"The lopinginny?\" Gaul said. Perrin frowned. \"It is a type of bird\", Gaul said. \"From the Three-fold Land. I did not see this man often, but he seemed to be the type who talked big, but was inwardly a coward\". \"Well, that was a front\", Perrin said. \"And either way, he is a very different person in the dream—here, he is a predator named Slayer who hunts wolves and men. He’s powerful. If he decides to kill you, he can appear behind you in an eyeblink and imagine you captured by vines and unable to move. You’ll be trapped as he slits your throat\". Gaul laughed. \"That’s funny?\" Perrin asked. \"You act as if it is something new\", Gaul explained. \"Yet in the first dream, wherever I go, I am surrounded by women and men who could tie me in air with a thought and kill me at any time. I am accustomed to being powerless around some, Perrin Aybara. It is the way of the world in all things\". \"Still\", Perrin said sternly, \"if we find Slayer—he’s a square-faced fellow, with eyes that don’t seem totally alive, and he dresses in dark leather—I want you to stay away from him","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-95.html","bookId":1601,"book":{"id":1601,"title":"A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14)","description":"Storyline: A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14) “And it came to pass in those days, as it had come before and would come again, that the Dark lay heavy on the land and weighed down the hearts of men, and the green things failed, and hope died.” From Charal Drianaan te Calamon, The Cycle of the Dragon.
