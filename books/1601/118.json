The moment lasted but a few seconds before she pulled back, standing up straight and putting on the face of the Amyrlin. So young, he thought, to have so much required of her.\n Of course, she wasn’t much younger than al’Thor himself. Gawyn was pleased, and a little surprised, that thinking of the man did not provoke any anger. Al’Thor would fight his fight. Really, what the man did was none of Gawyn’s business.\n Gawyn led Egwene to the Green Ajah section of camp, the several Warders at the perimeter greeting them with nods of respect. Maerin Sedai had a large tent. Most of the Aes Sedai had been allowed to bring what housing and furniture they wished, so long as they could make their own gateway for it and use their own Warders to carry it. If the army had to move quickly, such things would be abandoned. Many Aes Sedai had chosen to bring very little, but others . . . well, they were not accustomed to austerity. Maerin was one of those. Few had brought as much as she.\n Leilwin and Bayle Domon waited outside the tent. They had been the ones to inform Maerin Sedai that her tent was being borrowed, and that she wasn’t to tell anyone that Egwene was the one using it. The secret could be discovered if anyone asked around—they hadn’t hidden themselves while walking here—but at the same time, someone asking where the Amyrlin was sleeping would draw attention. It was the best protection Gawyn could arrange, since Egwene was unwilling to Travel each day to sleep.\n Egwene’s emotions immediately turned sour when she saw Leilwin.\n \"You did say you wanted to keep her close\", Gawyn said softly.\n \"I don’t like her knowing where I sleep. If their assassins do come looking for me in camp, she might be the one to lead them to me\".\n Gawyn fought down the instinct to argue. Egwene was a cunning, insightful woman—but she had a blind spot regarding anything Seanchan. He, on the other hand, found himself trusting Leilwin. She seemed to be the type who dealt straight with people.\n \"I\u0027ll keep an eye on her\", he said.\n Egwene composed herself with a breath, then walked to the tent and passed Leilwin without saying a word. Gawyn didn’t follow her inside.\n \"The Amyrlin seems intent on not letting me provide service\", Leilwin said to Gawyn in that telltale Seanchan drawl.\n \"She doesn’t trust you\", Gawyn said frankly.\n \"Is one’s oath worth so little on this side of the ocean?\" Leilwin said. \"I swore an oath to her that none would break, not even a Muyami!\"\n \"A Darkfriend will break any oath\".\n The woman eyed him coolly. \"I begin to think she assumes all Seanchan to be Darkfriends\".\n Gawyn shrugged. \"You beat her and imprisoned her, making her into an animal to be led by a collar\".\n \"I did not\", Leilwin said. \"If one baker made you foul bread, would you assume all of them seek to poison you? Bah. Do not argue. There is no point. If I cannot serve her, then I will serve you. Have you eaten today, Warder?\"\n Gawyn hesitated. When had he last had something to eat? This morning . . . no, he’d been too eager for the fight. His stomach grumbled loudly.\n \"I know you will not leave her\", Leilwin said, \"particularly under the watch of a Seanchan. Come, Bayle. Let us fetch this fool some food so that he does not faint if assassins do come\". She stalked off, her large Illianer husband following. The fellow shot a glare over his shoulder that could have cured leather.\n Gawyn sighed and settled down on the ground. From his pocket, he pulled three black rings; he selected one, then shoved the others back into his pocket.\n Talk of assassins always made him think of the rings, which he’d taken off the Seanchan who had come to kill Egwene. The rings were ter’angreal. They were the means by which those Bloodknives had moved quickly and blended into shadows.\n He held up the ring toward the light. It didn’t look like any ter’angreal he had seen, but an object of the Power could look like anything. The rings were of some heavy black stone he did not recognize. The outside was carved like thorns, though the inside surface—the side that touched the skin—was smooth.\n He turned the ring over in his fingers. He knew that he should go to Egwene with it. He also knew how the White Tower treated ter’angreal. They locked the objects away, afraid to experiment with them. But this was the Last Battle. If there was ever a time to take risks . . .\n You decided to stand in Egwene’s shadow, Gawyn, he thought. You decided you would protect her, do what she needed of you. She was winning this war, she and the Aes Sedai. Would he let himself grow as jealous of her as he had been of al’Thor?\n \"Is that what I believe it to be?\"\n Gawyn snapped his head up, fist closing around the ring. Leilwin and Bayle Domon had been to the mess tent and returned with a bowl for him. From the smell of it, the meal was barley stew again. The cooks used so much pepper it was almost sickening. Gawyn suspected they did so because the black flakes hid the bits of weevil.\n I can’t act like I’m doing something suspicious, he thought immediately. I can’t let her go to Egwene.\n \"This?\" he asked, holding up the ring. \"It’s one of the rings we recovered from the Seanchan assassins who tried to kill Egwene. We assume it’s a ter’angreal of some sort, though it’s not one the White Tower has ever heard of\".\n Leilwin hissed softly. \"Those are to be bestowed only by the Empress, may she—\" She cut herself off and took a deep breath. \"Only one appointed as a Bloodknife, one who has given their life to the Empress, is allowed to wear such a ring. For you to put one on would be very, very wrong\".\n \"Fortunately\", Gawyn said, \"I’m not wearing it\".\n \"The rings are dangerous\", Leilwin said. \"I do not know much of them, but they are said to kill those who use them. Do not let your blood touch the ring, or you will activate it, and that could be deadly, Warder\". She handed him the bowl of stew, then strode away.\n Domon didn’t follow her. The Illianer scratched at his short beard. \"She do not always be the most accommodating of women, my wife\", he said to Gawyn. \"But she do be strong and wise. You would do well to listen to her\".\n Gawyn pocketed the ring. \"Egwene would never allow me to wear it in the first place\". That was true. If she knew about it. \"Tell your wife that I appreciate the warning. I should warn you that the subject of the assassins is still a very sore subject for the Amyrlin. I’d suggest avoiding the topic of the Bloodknives, or their \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-118.html","bookId":1601,"book":{"id":1601,"title":"A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14)","description":"Storyline: \n A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14) \n “And it came to pass in those days, as it had come before and would come again, that the Dark lay heavy on the land and weighed down the hearts of men, and the green things failed, and hope died.” From Charal Drianaan te Calamon, The Cycle of the Dragon. \n In the Field of Merrilor the rulers of the nations gather to join behind Rand al’Thor, or to stop him from his plan to break the seals on the Dark One’s prison—which may be a sign of his madness, or the last hope of humankind.
