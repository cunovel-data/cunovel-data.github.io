How can you?\"\\n\\n He hesitated. \"Many things in life are uncertain\".\\n\\n \"So you don’t know\", she said. \"Well, I have been looking, reading, listening. Have you read the works of those who have studied this, thought about it?\"\\n\\n \"Aes Sedai speculation\".\\n\\n \"The only information we have, Rand! Open the Dark One’s prison and all could be lost. We have to be more careful. This is what the Amyrlin Seat is for, this is part of why the White Tower was founded in the first place!\" He actually hesitated. Light, he was thinking. Could she be getting through to him?\\n\\n \"I don’t like it, Egwene\", Rand said softly. \"If I go up against him and the seals are not broken, my only choice will be to create another imperfect solution. A patch, even worse than the one last time—because with the old, weakened seals there, I’ll just be spreading new plaster over deep cracks. Who knows how long the seals would last this time? In a few centuries, we could have this same fight all over again\".\\n\\n \"Is that so bad?\" Egwene said. \"At least it’s sure. You sealed the Bore last time. You know how to do it\".\\n\\n \"We could end up with the taint again\".\\n\\n \"We’re ready for it, this time. No, it wouldn’t be ideal. But Rand . . . do we really want to risk this? Risk the fate of every living being? Why not take the simple path, the known path? Mend the seals again. Shore up the prison\".\\n\\n \"No, Egwene\". Rand backed away. \"Light! Is this what it’s about? You want saidin to be tainted again. You Aes Sedai . . . you’re threatened by the idea of men who can channel, undermining your authority!\"\\n\\n \"Rand al’Thor, don’t you dare be that level of a fool\".\\n\\n He met her eyes. The rulers seemed to be paying little attention to this conversation, despite the fact that the world depended on it. They pored over Rand’s document, muttering in outrage. Perhaps that was what he had intended, to distract them with the document, then pounce for the real fight.\\n\\n Slowly, the rage melted from his face, and he raised his hand to the side of his head. \"Light, Egwene. You can still do it, like the sister I never had—tie my mind in knots and have me raving at you and loving you at the same time\".\\n\\n \"At least I’m consistent\", she said. They were now speaking very softly, leaning across the table toward one another. To the side, Perrin and Nynaeve were probably close enough to hear, and Min had joined them. Gawyn had returned, but he kept his distance. Cadsuane rounded the room, looking in the other direction—too pointedly. She was listening in.\\n\\n \"I am not making this argument in some fool hope to restore the taint\", Egwene said. \"You know I’m better than that. This is about protecting humankind. I can’t believe you are willing to risk everything on a slender chance\".\\n\\n \"A slender chance?\" Rand said. \"We’re talking about entering darkness instead of founding another Age of Legends. We could have peace, an end to suffering. Or we could have another Breaking. Light, Egwene. I don’t know for certain if I could mend the seals, or make new ones, in the same way. The Dark One has to be ready for that plan\".\\n\\n \"And you have another one?\"\\n\\n \"I’ve been telling it to you. I break the seals to get rid of the old, imperfect plug, and try again in a new way\".\\n\\n \"The world itself is the cost of failure, Rand\". She thought a moment. \"There’s more here. What aren’t you telling me?\"\\n\\n Rand looked hesitant, and for a moment, he seemed the child she’d once caught sneaking bites of Mistress Cauthon’s pies with Mat. \"I’m going to kill him, Egwene\".\\n\\n \"Who? Moridin?\"\\n\\n \"The Dark One\".\\n\\n She drew back in shock. \"I’m sorry. What did you—\"\\n\\n \"I’m going to kill him\", Rand said passionately, leaning in. \"I’m going to end the Dark One. We will never have true peace so long as he is there, lurking. I’ll rip open the prison, I’ll enter it and I’ll face him. I’ll build a new prison if I have to, but first, I’m going to try to end all of this. Protect the Pattern, the Wheel, for good\".\\n\\n \"Light, Rand, you’re insane!\"\\n\\n \"Yes. That is part of the price I have paid. Fortunately. Only a man with shaken wits would be daring enough to try this\".\\n\\n \"I’ll fight you, Rand\", she whispered. \"I won’t let you pull all of us into this. Listen to reason. The White Tower should be guiding you here\".\\n\\n \"I’ve known the White Tower’s guidance, Egwene\", he replied. \"In a box, beaten each day\".\\n\\n The two locked eyes across the table. Nearby, other arguments continued.\\n\\n \"I don’t mind signing this\", Tenobia said. \"It looks fine to me\".\\n\\n \"Bah!\" Gregorin snarled. \"You Borderlanders never care anything for southern politics. You’ll sign it? Well, good for you. I, however, won’t chain my country to the wall\".\\n\\n \"Curious\", Easar said. The calm man shook his head, pure white topknot bobbing. \"As I understand, it’s not your country, Gregorin. Unless you’re assuming that the Lord Dragon will die, and that Mattin Stepaneos will not demand his throne back. He may be willing for the Lord Dragon to wear the Laurel Crown, but not you, I’m sure\".\\n\\n \"Isn’t all of this meaningless?\" Alliandre asked. \"The Seanchan are our worry now, aren’t they? Peace can never exist so long as they are there.\\n\\n \"Yes\", Gregorin said. \"The Seanchan and those cursed Whitecloaks\".\\n\\n \"We will sign it\", Galad said. Somehow the Lord Captain Commander of the Children of the Light had ended up holding the official copy of the document. Egwene didn’t look at him. It was hard not to stare. She loved Gawyn, and not Galad, but . . . well . . . it was hard not to stare.\\n\\n \"Mayene will sign it as well\", Berelain said. \"I find the Lord Dragon’s will to be perfectly just\".\\n\\n \"Of course you’d sign it\". Darlin sniffed. \"My Lord Dragon, this document seems designed to protect the interests of some nations more than others\".\\n\\n \"I want to hear what his third requirement is\", Roedran said. \"I don’t care anything for talk of the seals; that is Aes Sedai business. He claimed there were three requirements, and we h \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-54.html","bookId":1601,"book":{"id":1601,"title":"A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14)","description":"Storyline: A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14) \\n “And it came to pass in those days, as it had come before and would come again, that the Dark lay heavy on the land and weighed down the hearts of men, and the green things failed, and hope died.” From Charal Drianaan te Calamon, The Cycle of the Dragon. \\n In the Field of Merrilor the rulers of the nations gather to join behind Rand al’Thor, or to stop him from his plan to break the seals on the Dark One’s prison—which may be a sign of his madness, or the last hope of humankind.
