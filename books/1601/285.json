The same matrons, the same farriers and blacksmiths, the very same people. He’d watched them die, and now they were back again.\\n\\n The Trollocs probably couldn’t tell one human from another, but the Dreadlords saw it—and understood that these were the same people. Those three Dreadlords seemed stunned. One of the Dreadlords yelled out about the Dark Lord abandoning them. He started flinging weaves at the people.\\n\\n Those people just charged on, heedless of the danger as many of their number were blown apart. They fell on the Dreadlords, hacking at them with farming implements and kitchen knives. By the time the Trollocs attacked, the Dreadlords were down. Now he could. . . .\\n\\n Shaking off his stupor, Grady gathered his power and destroyed the dam blocking the canyon.\\n\\n And in doing so, he released the river.\\n\\n CHAPTER 41\\n\\n A Smile\\n\\n \"Cauthon has the dragons back and fighting again\", Jonneth said, trying to peer through the smoke. \"Listen to them!\"\\n\\n Pounding echoed across the top of the Heights. Pevara smiled. She, Androl, Jonneth, Emarin and Canler had joined Logain and the other Ashaman, along with some of the Aes Sedai who were bonded to them. They stood at the edge of the steep slopes opposite Dashar Knob, a half mile up from where Demandred’s headless corpse lay.\\n\\n Another round of dragonfire sounded across the Heights, though in the darkness, they couldn’t see the smoke. \"Those dragons won’t last long, not if Taim’s men have mixed in with the Sharans\", Pevara said. \"The dragoners can’t defend themselves against channelers, and they’re too easy to locate because of the noise\".\\n\\n \"I doubt Cauthon has a choice but to use them\", Androl said. \"He can’t hold anything back now\".\\n\\n \"Asha’man!\" Logain appeared through the smoke, striding among them, Gabrelle at his side. \"It is time to move\".\\n\\n \"We’re going to go defend those dragons?\" Androl asked. Around them, dozens of other exhausted Asha’man hauled themselves to their feet, turning to Logain.\\n\\n \"No\", Logain said. \"We’re going to move west\".\\n\\n \"To the west?\" Pevara folded her arms. \"That’s away from the battle!\"\\n\\n \"It is where your Amyrlin fought Taim\", Logain said, turning away from her. \"The ground there, as well as many of the Sharans, was entombed in crystal. I want every Asha’man, soldier and Dedicated to whom I have not given other specific orders to begin searching. There is—\"\\n\\n The ground shook, rumbling ominously, and Pevara stumbled. Androl caught her by the arm, though she sensed exhaustion through the bond to match her own. They didn’t have much left in them.\\n\\n As the trembling subsided, Logan continued. \"Somewhere, inside that mass of crystals, is a golden scepter. Taim was said to have been holding it when Egwene al’Vere defeated him. we\u0027re going to find it. If any of you see it, do not touch it. Send for me\".\\n\\n Logain shouted the same orders to the next group of Asha’man. Androl watched him go, and Pevara sensed his frustration.\\n\\n \"If that scepter is an angreal or sa’angreal\", Emarin said, \"it could be of great use to us\".\\n\\n \"Maybe\", Pevara said. \"I think those dragons need protecting more than we need that rod. I swear there’s something about that horn sounding. We should be attacking now, not searching for battle spoils . . \".\\n\\n \"The other Asha’man can do that\", Androl said. \"We don’t have to\".\\n\\n \"What?\" Canler said, scowling. \"You’re going to disobey?\"\\n\\n \"No\", Androl said. \"He said this is for men who didn’t have any other orders. We do. Back at the start of the battle he told us to watch for Taim’s lackeys and to do something about them\".\\n\\n \"I’m not sure he remembers that order, Androl\", Emarin said, rubbing his chin. \"And I don’t know that if he did remember, he’d want us to follow it now. He seems pretty intent on that scepter\".\\n\\n \"He gave us the order nonetheless\", Androl said.\\n\\n \"Androl\", Canler said, sitting on his heels, \"I feel so tired, I could hardly gather the strength to curse you if I wanted. None of these lads look any better, and you struggle to open a small gateway. How are we going to stand up to Mishraile and the others?\"\\n\\n Androl frowned, but had no argument in return. However, something occurred to Pevara. A way, perhaps, to accomplish something while exhausted . . .\\n\\n Androl perked up, and his eyes widened, and then he grinned. \"You’re a genius, Pevara\".\\n\\n \"Thank you\", she said primly. \"Canler, haul yourself to your feet. I’ll bet you gentlemen anything that we’ll find Taim’s men trying to destroy those dragons. We’re going to give them something of a surprise . . \".\\n\\n What a mess this had become.\\n\\n Moghedien kicked Demandred\u0027s corpse. It had been abandoned, the Sharans having gone to fight Cauthon’s army and avenge their leader.\\n\\n Demandred. The fool had let himself become distracted. If you focused too much on personal grudges, or if you let yourself be entangled with the worms you worked with . . . well, Demandred had earned his reward. Death, and likely eternal punishment at the Great Lord’s hands.\\n\\n Now that Demandred was indeed dead, she reached for the One Power—and found something else. A glowing river ten times as powerful, ten times as sweet. With so many of the Chosen having fallen, the Great Lord had opened himself to her. Survival was truly the best way to prove oneself to him.\\n\\n This changed her plans dramatically. First, she burned Demandred’s corpse to powder. Then she quickly wove the Mask of Mirrors—oh, how sweet the True Power was!—and replaced her form with an image of Demandred’s. She always made certain she could imitate the other Chosen. Demandred would be difficult, as he had changed so much recently, but she had paid close attention. No one touching her would be fooled; she would be careful.\\n\\n Disguise in place, she Traveled to the back lines of the Sharan army fighting Cauthon’s troops. Here were the reserve units, waiting to move forward, as well as supply carts and some of the wounded.\\n\\n The Sharans stopped sorting supplies to look at her. Gaping. They had been preparing to flee the battlefield itself. They were aware, as was everyone, that the huge Seanchan army had joined in the fight. She noticed that there were a handful of Ayyad in this group—only three, she could see. Two women with tattoos, and a grimy male channeler who squatted at their feet. Most of the others had been killed in the con \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-285.html","bookId":1601,"book":{"id":1601,"title":"A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14)","description":"Storyline: A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14) \\n “And it came to pass in those days, as it had come before and would come again, that the Dark lay heavy on the land and weighed down the hearts of men, and the green things failed, and hope died.” From Charal Drianaan te Calamon, The Cycle of the Dragon. \\n In the Field of Merrilor the rulers of the nations gather to join behind Rand al’Thor, or to stop him from his plan to break the seals on the Dark One’s prison—which may be a sign of his madness, or the last hope of humankind.
