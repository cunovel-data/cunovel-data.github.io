He seemed very troubled by something—she could feel his anxiety—though he should have been pleased. He had convinced the Seanchan to fight. What was it that, in his meeting with Egwene al’Vere, had disturbed him so?\\n\\n Rand turned and looked upward, toward the peak of Shayol Ghul. Staring at it, his emotions changed. He seemed a man looking at a fountain in the Three-fold Land, savoring the idea of cool water. Aviendha could feel his anticipation. There was also fear in him, of course. No warrior ever rid himself completely of the fear. He controlled it, overwhelmed it with the thirst to be on with the fight, to test himself.\\n\\n Men or women could not know themselves, not truly, until they were strained to their absolute limit. Until they danced the spears with death, felt their blood seeping out to stain the ground, and drove the weapon home into the beating heart of an enemy. Rand al’Thor wanted this, and she understood him because of it. Strange to realize, after all of this time, just how alike they were.\\n\\n She stepped up to him, and he moved so that he stood just beside her, his shoulder touching hers. He did not drape an arm around her, and she did not take his hand. He did not own her, and she did not own him. The act of his movement so that they faced the same direction meant far more to her than any other gesture could.\\n\\n \"Shade of my heart\", he said softly, watching his Asha’man open a gateway, \"what did you see?\"\\n\\n \"A tomb\", she replied.\\n\\n \"Mine?\"\\n\\n \"No. That of your enemy. The place where he was buried once, and the place he will slumber again\".\\n\\n Something hardened inside Rand. She could feel it, his resolve.\\n\\n \"You mean to kill him\", Aviendha whispered. \"Sightblinder himself\".\\n\\n \"Yes\".\\n\\n She waited.\\n\\n \"Others tell me I am a fool for thinking this\", Rand said. His guards moved through the gateway to return to Merrilor.\\n\\n \"No warrior should enter a battle without intending to see that battle finished\", Aviendha said. She hesitated after saying it, something else occurring to her.\\n\\n \"What is it?\" Rand asked.\\n\\n \"Well, the greatest victory would be to take your enemy gai’shain\".\\n\\n \"I doubt he would submit to that\", Rand said.\\n\\n \"Don’t make jest\", she said, elbowing him in the side, earning a grunt. \"This must be considered, Rand al’Thor. Which is the better way of ji’e’toh?\"\\n\\n \"Is imprisoning the Dark One like taking him gai’shain? If so, that would be the proper path\".\\n\\n \"I’m not certain I care what is proper’ this time, Aviendha\".\\n\\n \"A warrior must always consider ji’e’toh\", she said sternly. \"Have I taught you nothing? Do not speak like that, or you will shame me again before the other Wise Ones\".\\n\\n \"I had hoped that—considering how our relationship has progressed—we would be through with the lectures, Aviendha\".\\n\\n \"You thought that growing closer to me would end the lectures?\" she asked, baffled. Rand al’Thor, I have been among wetlander wives, and I’ve seen that they—\"\\n\\n He shook his head, leading the way through the gateway, Aviendha following. He seemed amused, and that was good. Some of his anxiety had faded. But truly, this was not a jest. Wetlanders did not have good senses of humor. Sometimes, they did not understand at all when to laugh.\\n\\n On the other side of the gateway, they entered a camp made up of many groups. Rand had command of the Maidens and the siswai’aman, along with most of the Wise Ones.\\n\\n Just outside of the Aiel camp were the Aes Sedai. Rand had command of some three dozen—all of the Aes Sedai who had sworn to him personally, and most who were bonded to his Asha’man. That meant another two dozen Asha’man, of various ranks.\\n\\n He also had Rodel Ituralde and his force, composed primarily of Domani. Their king, with his wispy beard and the beauty mark on his cheek, rode with them as well, but left the command to the great captain. The monarch gestured, and Ituralde walked over to give a report. Alsalam seemed uncomfortable around Rand, and did not go on any excursions when the Dragon did. Aviendha liked that arrangement. She wasn’t certain she trusted this Alsalam.\\n\\n Outside the Aiel tents camped another large military force, the Tairen army, including the elite force known as the Defenders of the Stone, led by a man named Rodrivar Tihera. Their king was with them as well, and was generally considered the highest authority in their gathered armies, aside from Rand.\\n\\n The Tairens would form a key part of Rodel Ituralde’s plans. As much as it galled Aviendha to admit it, Ituralde was right. The Aiel were not a defensive force, and though they could hold a pass if needed, they would be better used for offensive maneuvers.\\n\\n The Tairens would be perfect for holding ground. They had well-trained companies of pikemen, and a full banner of crossbowmen with a new kind of crossbow crank, knowledge of which the smiths had only just received. They had spent the last week converting the equipment to the new style.\\n\\n There was one other group in Rand\u0027s force, and it was the most baffling to Aviendha. Dragonsworn in large numbers. They camped together, and flew a flag that placed the image of the dragon over the ancient symbol of the Aes Sedai. The group was made up of common men, soldiers, lords, ladies and some Aes Sedai and Warders. They came from all nations, including the Aiel, and shared only one common bond: They had put aside all loyalties, broken all bonds, to fight in the Last Battle. Aviendha had heard discomforting rumors that many of the Aiel among them were gai’shain who had put aside the white, claiming they would take it up again when the Last Battle was won.\\n\\n Rand\u0027s coming was said to remove all bonds from men. Oaths shattered when he drew near, and any loyalty or alliance was secondary to the need to serve him in this last fight for humankind. Part of her wanted to name that wetlander foolishness, but perhaps she used that term too easily. A Wise One had to see with better eyes than that.\\n\\n Now that they were on the other side of the gateway, Aviendha finally allowed herself to release saidar. The world dulled around her, the added sense of life and wonder evaporating. Every time she released the One Power, she felt slightly hollow, the joy and thril \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-130.html","bookId":1601,"book":{"id":1601,"title":"A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14)","description":"Storyline: A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14) \\n “And it came to pass in those days, as it had come before and would come again, that the Dark lay heavy on the land and weighed down the hearts of men, and the green things failed, and hope died.” From Charal Drianaan te Calamon, The Cycle of the Dragon. \\n In the Field of Merrilor the rulers of the nations gather to join behind Rand al’Thor, or to stop him from his plan to break the seals on the Dark One’s prison—which may be a sign of his madness, or the last hope of humankind.
