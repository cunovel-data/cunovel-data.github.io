So long as I live, the White Tower stands.\\n\\n She still let Gawyn hold her.\\n\\n Aviendha crawled across the rock like a winter lizard seeking warmth. Her fingertips, though callused, were beginning to burn from the bitter cold. Shayol Ghul was cold, with air that smelled as if it came from a tomb.\\n\\n Rhuarc crawled to her left, a Stone Dog named Shaen to her right. Both wore the red headband of the siswai’aman. She didn’t know what to make of Rhuarc, a clan chief, donning that headband. He had never spoken of it; it was as if the headband did not exist. So it was with all of the siswai’aman. Amys crawled on Shaen’s right. For once, no one had objected to Wise Ones joining the advance scouts. In a place such as this, at a time such as this, the eyes of one who could channel might see what ordinary eyes would not.\\n\\n Aviendha pulled herself forward, making no noise, despite the necklaces she wore. No plants sprouted on these rocks, not even mold or lichen. They were deep within the Blasted Lands, now. Almost as deep as one could go.\\n\\n Rhuarc reachcd the ridge first, and she saw him tense. Aviendha arrived next, peering over the side of the rock, keeping low so as not to be seen. Her breath stopped dead in her throat.\\n\\n She\u0027d heard stories of this place. Of the massive forge near the base of the slope, a single black stream running past it. That water had been poisoned to the point that it would kill any who touched it. Hearths dotted the valley like open wounds, reddening the fog around them. As a young Maiden, she\u0027d listened with wide eyes as an ancient roofmistress told of the creatures who worked the Shadow\u0027s forges, creatures that were not dead and not alive. Silent and horrible, the brutish things moved with steps that held no life—like the ticking hands of a clock.\\n\\n The forgers paid little heed to the cages full of humans whose blood would be spilled to temper newly forged blades. The captives might as well have been chunks of iron. Though Aviendha was too far to hear the humans’ whimpers, she felt them. Her fingers grew taut upon the rocks.\\n\\n Shayol Ghul itself dominated the valley, its black slopes rising like a serrated knife into the sky. The sides were rent with cuts, like the skin of a man who had been whipped a hundred times, each score leaving a gash that spat steam. Perhaps that steam created the fog that lay over the valley. The fog churned and surged, as if the valley were a cup holding liquid.\\n\\n \"Such a terrible place\", Amys whispered.\\n\\n Aviendha had never heard such dread in the woman’s voice. That chilled Aviendha nearly as much as the bitter wind that ruffled their clothing. Distant pings broke the air, the workers forging. A black column of smoke rose from the nearest forge, and did not dissipate. It rose like an umbilical cord to the clouds above, which rained down lightning with dreadful frequency.\\n\\n Yes, Aviendha had heard stories of this place. Those stories had failed to convey the full truth. One could not describe this place. One had to experience it.\\n\\n A scraping from behind, and in a few moments, Rodel Ituralde crawled up next to Rhuarc. He moved quietly, for a wetlander.\\n\\n \"You were so impatient that you could not await our report?\" Rhuarc asked softly.\\n\\n \"No report can convey what a man’s own eyes can\", Ituralde said. \"I didn’t promise I’d stay behind. I told you to go ahead. And you did\". He raised his looking glass, shading the front with his hand, though that probably wasn’t necessary with those clouds.\\n\\n Rhuarc frowned. He and the other Aiel who had come north had agreed to follow a wetlander general, but it did not sit well with them. Nor should it. They would do this thing without growing comfortable. Comfort was the great killer of men.\\n\\n Let it be enough, Aviendha thought, turning back to look at the valley. Enough for my people. Enough for Rand and the task he ynust accomplish.\\n\\n Seeing the end of her people had nauseated and horrified her, but also awakened her. If the end of the Aiel was the sacrifice required for Rand to win, she would make it. She would scream and curse the Creator’s own name, but she would pay that price. Any warrior would. Better that one people should end than the world fall completely under Shadow.\\n\\n The Light willing, it would not come to that. The Light willing, her actions with the Dragons Peace would serve to protect and shelter the Aiel. She would not let the possibility of failure stop her. They would fight. Waking from the dream was always a possibility when the spears were danced.\\n\\n \"Interesting\", Ituralde said softly, still looking through his glass. \"Your thoughts, Aiel?\"\\n\\n \"We need to create a distraction\", Rhuarc said. \"We can come down the slope just to the east of the forge and set those captives free and break the place apart. This stops the Myrddraal from receiving new weapons and will keep the Dark Ones eyes on us and not the Car’a’carn\"\\n\\n \"How long will it take the Dragon?\" Ituralde asked. \"What do you think, Aiel? How much time do we give him to save the world?\"\\n\\n \"He will fight\", Amys said. \"Enter the mountain, duel with Sight-blinder. It will take as long as a fight needs to take. A few hours, perhaps? I have not seen a duel last much longer than that, even between two men of great skill\".\\n\\n \"Let us assume\", Ituralde said with a smile, \"that there is going to be more to it than a duel\".\\n\\n \"I am not a fool, Rodel Ituralde\", Amys said coolly. \"I doubt that the Car’a’carris fight will be one of spears and shields. However, when he cleansed the Source, did that not happen in the space of a single day? Perhaps this will be similar\".\\n\\n \"Perhaps\", Ituralde said. \"Perhaps not\". He lowered the glass and looked to the Aiel. \"Which possibility would you rather plan for?\"\\n\\n \"The worst one\", Aviendha said.\\n\\n \"So we plan to hold out as long as the Dragon needs\", Ituralde said. \"Days, weeks, months . . . years? As long as it takes\".\\n\\n Rhuarc nodded slowly. \"What do you suggest?\"\\n\\n \"The pass into the valley is narrow\", Ituralde said. \"Scout reports put most of the Shadowspawn left in the Blight out beyond the pass there. Even they spend as little time as they can in this forsaken place. If we can close off the pass and seize this valley—destroy those forgeworkers and the few Fades down there—we could hold this place for ages. You Aiel are good at slash-and-run tactics. Burn me, but I know that from personal experience. You lot attack that forge, and we’ll set about c \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-129.html","bookId":1601,"book":{"id":1601,"title":"A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14)","description":"Storyline: A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14) \\n “And it came to pass in those days, as it had come before and would come again, that the Dark lay heavy on the land and weighed down the hearts of men, and the green things failed, and hope died.” From Charal Drianaan te Calamon, The Cycle of the Dragon. \\n In the Field of Merrilor the rulers of the nations gather to join behind Rand al’Thor, or to stop him from his plan to break the seals on the Dark One’s prison—which may be a sign of his madness, or the last hope of humankind.
