She stood upright, with a shawl about her shoulders, though she did not look like an Aes Sedai. She had a mature face, aged and wise, with a wise look about her and a smile on her face. \"An angreal?\" Elayne asked. \"No, a Seed\". \"A . . . seed?\" \"You have the Talent of creating ter’angreal\", Rand said. \"Creating angreal requires a different process. It begins with one of these, an object created to draw your Power and instill it into something else. It takes time, and will weaken you for several months, so you should not attempt it while we are at war. But when I found it, forgotten, I thought of you. I had wondered what I could give you\". \"Oh, Rand, I have something for you as well\". She hurried over to an ivory jewelry chest that rested on a camp table and took a small object from it. It was a dagger with a short, dull blade and a handle made of deerhorn wrapped in gold wire. Rand glanced at the dagger quizzically. \"No offense, but that looks like a poor weapon, Elayne\". \"It’s a ter’angreal, something that may be of use when you go to Shayol Ghul. With it, the Shadow cannot see you\". She reached up to touch his face. He placed his hand on hers. They stayed together long into the night. CHAPTER 10 The Use of Dragons Perrin rode Stayer, light cavalry from Elayne’s forces following behind him: Whitecloaks, Mayeners, Ghealdanin, joined by some of the Band of the Red Hand. Only a fraction of their armies. That was the point. They swept along diagonally toward the Trollocs camped outside of Caemlyn. The city still smoldered; Elayne’s plan with the oil had driven the creatures out, for the most part, but some still held the walls above. \"Archers\", Arganda yelled, \"loose!\" His voice would be lost to most in the roar of the charge, the snorting of horses, the gallop of hooves. Enough would hear to start shooting, and the rest knew what to do anyway. Perrin leaned low, hoping his hammer would not be needed on this sortie. They charged past the Trollocs, sweeping in front of them, launching arrows; then they turned away from the city. Perrin glanced over his shoulder as he rode, and he was rewarded with the sight of Trollocs falling. The Band followed after Perrin\u0027s cavalry, getting close enough to launch arrows. Trolloc arrows followed—thick and black, almost like spears, loosed from enormous bows. Some of Perrin\u0027s riders fell, but his attack had been swift. The Trollocs didn’t break from their position outside the city walls. The riders slowed, Arganda coming up beside Perrin, watching over his shoulder. \"They still aren’t charging\", Arganda said. \"Then we’ll hit them again and again\", Perrin said. \"Until they break\". \"Our attacks are continuing, Your Majesty\", the messenger said, riding through a gateway made by a pair of Kinswomen to where Elayne had her camp in the Wood. \"Lord Goldeneyes sends word; they’ll continue through the day, if need be\". She nodded, and the messenger rode back the way he had come. Braem Wood slumbered, trees bare, as if in winter. \"It takes too much work to relay information back and forth to me\", Elayne said with dissatisfaction. \"I wish we could have made those ter’angreal work; Aviendha said that one let you see over distance, and another talk that way. But wish and want trip the feet, as Lini says. Still, if I could see the fighting with my own eyes—\" Birgitte said nothing. Eyes forward, the golden-haired Warder gave no sign at all that she’d heard the comment. \"After all\", Elayne said, \"I can defend myself, as I have proven on a number of occasions\". No response. The two horses walked softly beside one another, hooves on soft earth. The camp around them had been designed to be broken down and moved on the run. The soldiers’ \"tents\" were canvas tarps set over ropes pulled tight between trees. The only travel furniture was that of her own pavilion and the battle pavilion. The Kinswomen had one group ready with gateways to move Elayne and her commanders further into the woods. Most of her forces waited at the ready, like a taut bow with the arrow nocked. She would not engage the Trollocs on their terms, however. By report, some of their fists still topped the city walls, and attacking directly would be a disaster, with them raining death on her from above. She would draw them out. If that required patience, so be it. \"I’ve decided\", Elayne continued to Birgitte. \"I’ll just hop through a gateway to take a look at the Trolloc army myself. From a safe distance. I could—\" Birgitte reached beneath her shirt and removed the foxhead medallion she wore, one of the three imperfect copies Elayne had made. Mat had the original and a copy. Mellar had escaped with the other copy. \"You try anything like that\", Birgitte said, eyes still forward, \"and I’ll throw you over my bloody shoulder like a drunken man with a barmaid on a rowdy night and carry you back to camp. Light help me, I’ll do it, Elayne\". Elayne frowned. \"Remind me why, exactly, I gave you one of those medallions?\" \"I’m not sure\", Birgitte said. \"It showed remarkable foresight and an actual sense of self-preservation. Completely unlike you\". \"I hardly think that is fair, Birgitte\". \"I know! It is extremely unfair for me to have to deal with you. I wasn’t certain you’d noticed. Are all young Aes Sedai as reckless as you are, or did I just end up with the pick of this particular litter?\" \"Stop whining\", Elayne muttered, maintaining a smile and a nod for the men who saluted as she passed. \"I’m beginning to wish I had a Tower-trained Warder. Then, at least, I wouldn’t hear so much sauce\". Birgitte laughed. \"I don’t think you understand Warders half as well as you think you do, Elayne\". Elayne let the matter die as they passed the Traveling ground, where Sumeko and the other Kinswomen were shuttling messengers back and forth from the battlefields. For now, Elayne’s agreement with them held. In her dress pocket, Elayne carried Egwene’s—the Amyrlin Seat’s—official reply regarding the Kin and what Elayne had done. Elayne could almost sense heat radiating from the letter, but it was hidden behind official language and an agreement that now wasn’t the time to worry about such things. Elayne would have to do more work there. Egwene would eventually see the logic of letting the Kinswomen work in Andor, beneath Elayne’s supervision. Just beyond the Traveling ground she noticed a tired-looking Shienaran accepting a waterskin from one of the Two Rivers men.
