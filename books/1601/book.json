Egwene, the Amyrlin Seat, leans toward the former. \n In Andor, the Trollocs seize Caemlyn. \n In the wolf dream, Perrin Aybara battles Slayer. \n Approaching Ebou Dar, Mat Cauthon plans to visit his wife Tuon, now Fortuona, Empress of the Seanchan. \n All humanity is in peril—and the outcome will be decided in Shayol Ghul itself. The Wheel is turning, and the Age is coming to its end. The Last Battle will determine the fate of the world...\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14.jpg","author":"Robert Jordan","type":"Fantasy","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":310,"category":{"id":18,"name":"Fantasy","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
