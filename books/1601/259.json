How? How had a lady like Faile learned to act like a servant?\n The guard grunted. \"Go on\", he said, waving to Aravine. \"Wait there until we send for you\".\n The group shuffled to a patch of ground nearby where Aravine ordered everyone to sit down. She stood to the side, arms folded, tapping one toe as she waited. Thunder rumbled, and Olver felt an odd chill. He looked up, and into the eyeless face of a Myrddraal.\n A shock ran through Olver, like he’d been dropped into an icy lake. He couldn’t breathe. The Myrddraal seemed to glide as it moved, its cloak motionless and dead, as it rounded the group. After a horrible moment, it moved on, back toward the supply camp.\n \"Searching for channelers\", Faile whispered to Mandevwin.\n \"Light help us\", the man whispered back.\n The wait was nearly insufferable. Eventually, a plump woman in white clothing strode up and wove a gateway. Aravine barked for them all to climb to their feet, then waved them through. Olver joined the line, walking near Faile, and they passed from the land of red soil and cold air to a place that smelled like it was on fire.\n They entered a ramshackle camp filled with Trollocs. Several large cookpots boiled nearby. Just behind the camp, a slope led up sharply to some kind of large plateau. Streams of smoke rose from the top of it, and from there and somewhere to Olver’s left could be heard the sounds of combat. Turning away from the slope, the boy saw the darkened outline of a tall, narrow mountain far in the distance, rising from the flat plain like a candle in the middle of a table.\n He looked back up the slope behind the camp, and his heart leaped. A body was plummeting down from the top of the slope, still clutching in its hand a banner—a banner that bore a large red hand. The Band of the Red Hand! The man and banner fell among a group of Trollocs eating sizzling pieces of meat around a fire. Sparks flew in all directions, and the enraged beasts yanked the intruder out of the flames, but he was long past caring what they did to him.\n \"Faile!\" he whispered.\n \"I see it\". Her bundle concealed the sack with the Horn in it. She added, more to herself, \"Light. How are we going to reach Mat?\"\n They moved off to the side as the rest of her group came through the gateway. They had swords, but carried them bundled up like arrows, in packs, atop the backs of a few of the men as if they were tied-up supplies for the battlefield.\n \"Blood and ashes\", Mandevwin whispered, joining the two of them. Captives whimpered from a pen nearby. \"Maybe they’ll put us in there? We could sneak out in the night\".\n Faile shook her head. \"They’ll take our bundles. Leave us unarmed.\n \"Then what do we do?\" Mandevwin asked, glancing to the side as a group of Trollocs passed, dragging corpses harvested from the front lines. \"Start fighting? Hope Lord Mat sees us, and sends help?\"\n Olver didn’t think much of that plan. He wanted to fight, but those Trollocs were big. One passed nearby, and its wolf-featured head swung his way. Eyes that could have belonged to a man looked him up and down, as if hungry. Olver stepped back, then reached toward his bundle, where he’d hidden his knife.\n \"We’ll run\", Faile whispered, once the Trolloc passed. \"Scatter in a dozen different directions, and in doing so, try to disorient them. Maybe a few of us will escape\". She frowned. \"What is delaying Aravine?\"\n Almost as she said it, Aravine strode through the gateway. The woman in white who had channeled followed her out, and then Aravine pointed at Faile.\n Faile jerked into the air. Olver gasped, and Mandevwin cursed, throwing down his bundle and digging for his sword while Arrela and Selande shouted. All three were hauled into the air by weaves moment later, and Aiel in red veils ran through the gateway, weapons out.\n Pandemonium followed. A few of Faile’s soldiers fell as they tried to fight back with their fists. Olver dove for the ground, hunting for his knife, but by the time he had his hand on its hilt, the skirmish was over. The others were all subdued or tied in air.\n So fast! Olver thought with despair. Why hadn’t anyone warned him that fighting happened so quickly?\n They seemed to have forgotten him, but he didn’t know what to do.\n Aravine walked up to Faile, still hanging in the air. What was happening? Aravine . . . she had betrayed them?\n \"I am sorry, my Lady,’’ Aravine said to Faile. Olver could barely hear. Nobody paid any attention to him; the Aiel kept watch on the soldiers, shoving them into a group to be guarded. More than a few of their number lay bleeding on the ground.\n Faile struggled in the air, her face growing red as she strained. Her mouth was obviously gagged. Faile would never remain quiet at a time like this.\n Aravine untied the Horn’s bag from Faile’s back, then checked inside it. Her eyes widened. She pulled the sack tight at the top and held it close. \"I had hoped\", she whispered to Faile, \"to leave my old life behind. To start fresh and new. I thought I could hide, or that I would be forgotten, that I could come back to the Light. But the Great Lord does not forget, and one cannot hide from him. They found me the very night we reached Andor. This is not what I intended, but it is what I must do\".\n Aravine turned away. \"A horse!\" she called. \"I will deliver this package to Lord Demandred myself, as I have been commanded\".\n The woman in white walked up beside her, and the two started arguing in hushed tones. Olver glanced about. Nobody was looking at him.\n His fingers started trembling. He’d known that Trollocs were big, and that they were ugly. But . . . these things were nightmares. Nightmares all around. Oh, Light!\n What would Mat do?\n \"Dovie’andi se tovya sagain\", Olver whispered, unsheathing his knife. With a cry, he threw himself at the woman in white and rammed his knife into her lower back.\n She screamed. Faile dropped free of her bonds of Air. And then, suddenly, the captive pens burst open and a group of yelling men scrambled to freedom.\n \"Raise it higher!\" Doesine cried. \"Flaming quickly!\"\n Leane obeyed, weaving Earth with the other sisters. The ground trembled in front of them, buckling and slumping like a bunched-up rug. They finished, then used the mound for cover as fire dropped from upslope.\n Doesine led the motley bunch. A dozen or so Aes Sedai, a smattering of Warders and soldiers. The men clutched their weapons, but lately those had proven about as effective as loaves of bread. The Power crackled and sizzled in the air. The improvised bulwark thumped as Shar \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-259.html","bookId":1601,"book":{"id":1601,"title":"A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14)","description":"Storyline: \n A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14) \n “And it came to pass in those days, as it had come before and would come again, that the Dark lay heavy on the land and weighed down the hearts of men, and the green things failed, and hope died.” From Charal Drianaan te Calamon, The Cycle of the Dragon. \n In the Field of Merrilor the rulers of the nations gather to join behind Rand al’Thor, or to stop him from his plan to break the seals on the Dark One’s prison—which may be a sign of his madness, or the last hope of humankind.
