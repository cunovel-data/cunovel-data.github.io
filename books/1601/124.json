During the War of Power, even the Forsaken grew to fear using it, lest they unravel the world itself\".\n \"We must spread the word to all of our allies\", Amys said. \"We must not use this weave\".\n \"It is forbidden of Aes Sedai already\", Egwene said. \"But I will make it known that nobody is to consider breaking that rule\".\n \"That is wise\", Melaine said. \"For a people with so many rules for themselves, I have found that the Aes Sedai are very proficient at ignoring guidelines if their situation allows it\".\n \"We trust our women\", Egwene said. \"The Oaths hold them; otherwise, their own wisdom must guide them. If Moiraine had not been willing to bend this rule, Perrin would be dead—as would Mat, had Rand ignored the rule. But I will speak to the women\".\n Balefire bothered her. Not that it existed or did what it did. It was uniquely dangerous. And yet, what was it Perrin had said to her in the dream? It’s only another weave . . .\n It seemed unfair that the Shadow should have access to such a weapon as this, one that unraveled the Pattern as it was used. How would they fight it, how could they counter it?\n \"This is not the only reason we sent to you, Egwene al’Vere\", Melaine said. \"You have seen the changes to the World of Dreams?\"\n Egwene nodded. \"The storm grows worse here\".\n \"We will not be visiting here often in the future\", Amys said. \"We have made the decision. And, despite our complaints about him, the Car’a’carn does prepare his armies to move. It will not be long before we march with him to the Shadow’s own hold\".\n Egwene nodded slowly. \"So this is it\".\n \"I am proud of you, girl\", Amys said. Amys, tough-as-rocks Amys, looked teary-eyed. They rose, and Egwene embraced them one at a time.\n \"Light shelter you, Amys, Melaine, Bair\", Egwene said. \"Give my love to the others\".\n \"It will be done, Egwene al’Vere\", Bair said. \"May you find water and shade, now and always\".\n One by one, they faded from Tear. Egwene took a deep breath, looking upward. The building groaned, like a ship in a tempest. The rock itself seemed to shift around her.\n She had loved this place—not the Stone, but Tel’ararirhiod. It had taught her so much. But she knew, as she prepared to leave, that it was like a river in dangerous flood. Familiar and loved it might be, but she could not risk herself here. Not while the White Tower needed her.\n \"And farewell to you, old friend\", she said to the air. \"Until I dream again\".\n She let herself wake.\n Gawyn waited beside the bed, as usual. They were back in the Tower, Egwene fully dressed, in the chamber near her study. It was not yet evening, but the request from the Wise One was not something she had wished to ignore.\n \"He\u0027s here\", Gawyn said quietly, glancing at the door to her study.\n \"Then let us meet him\", Egwene said. She prepared herself, rising, smoothing her skirt. She nodded to Gawyn, and they stepped out and went to meet the Dragon Reborn.\n Rand smiled when he saw her. He waited inside with two Maidens she did not know.\n \"What is this about?\" Egwene asked tiredly. \"Convincing me to break the seals?\"\n \"You’ve grown cynical\", Rand noted.\n \"The last two times we met\", Egwene said, \"you pointedly tried to infuriate me. Am I not to expect it again?\"\n \"I am not trying to infuriate you\", Rand said. \"Look, here\". He pulled something from his pocket. A hair ribbon. He held it out to her. \"You always looked forward so to being able to braid your hair\".\n \"So now you imply I’m a child?\" Egwene asked, exasperated. Gawyn rested a hand on her shoulder, comforting.\n \"What? No!\" Rand sighed. \"Light, Egwene. I want to make amends. You’re like a sister to me; I never had siblings. Or, at least, the one I have doesn’t know me. I only have you. Please. I’m not trying to rile you\".\n For a moment, he seemed just as he had long ago. An innocent boy, earnest. Egwene let her frustration melt away. \"Rand, I’m busy. We are busy. There isn’t time for things like this. Your armies are impatient\".\n \"Their time will soon come\", Rand said, growing harder. \"Before this is through, they will wonder why they were so eager, and will look with longing at these restful days waiting\". He still held the ribbon in his hand, forming a fist. \"I just . . . I didn’t want to go to my fight with our last meeting having been an argument, even if it was an important one\".\n \"Oh, Rand\", Egwene said. She stepped forward, taking the ribbon. She embraced him. Light, but he’d been difficult to deal with lately—but she’d thought the same thing about her parents on occasion. \"I support you. It doesn’t mean I’m going to do as you say with the seals, but I do support you\". Egwene released Rand. She would not be teary-eyed. Even if it did seem like a last parting for them.\n \"Wait\", Gawyn said. \"Sibling? You have a sibling?\"\n \"I am the son of Tigraine\", Rand said, shrugging, \"born after she went to the Waste and became a Maiden\".\n Gawyn looked stunned, though Egwene had figured this out ages ago. \"You are Galad’s brother?\" Gawyn asked.\n \"Half-brother\", Rand said. \"Not that it would probably mean much to a Whitecloak. We had the same mother. His father, like yours, was Taringail, but mine was an Aiel\".\n \"I think Galad would surprise you\", Gawyn said softly. \"But Elayne . . \".\n \"Not to tell you your own family history, but Elayne is not related to me\". Rand turned to Egwene. \"May I see them? The seals. Before I go to Shayol Ghul, I would look upon them one last time. I promise not to do anything with them\".\n Reluctantly, she fished them from the pouch at her waist where she often kept them. Gawyn, still looking stunned, walked to the window and pushed it open, letting light into the room. The White Tower felt still . . . silent. Its armies were gone, its masters at war.\n She unwrapped the first seal and handed it to Rand. She would not give him all of them at once. Just in case. She did trust his word; it was Rand after all \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-124.html","bookId":1601,"book":{"id":1601,"title":"A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14)","description":"Storyline: \n A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14) \n “And it came to pass in those days, as it had come before and would come again, that the Dark lay heavy on the land and weighed down the hearts of men, and the green things failed, and hope died.” From Charal Drianaan te Calamon, The Cycle of the Dragon. \n In the Field of Merrilor the rulers of the nations gather to join behind Rand al’Thor, or to stop him from his plan to break the seals on the Dark One’s prison—which may be a sign of his madness, or the last hope of humankind.
