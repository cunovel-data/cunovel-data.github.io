She wouldn’t mind terribly if he’d done so, though she would never tell him that. In fact, once this was all said and done, she would insinuate that she was offended and see how he reacted. He needed to know that she would not sit back and be coddled, even if her true name implied otherwise.\\n\\n Faile pulled her wagon, which was first in the caravan, onto the Jualdhe Bridge out of Tar Valon. About halfway across, the bridge trembled. The horses stomped and tossed their heads as Faile slowed them and glanced over her shoulder. The sight of swaying buildings in Tar Valon proved to her that the trembling wasn’t just the bridge, but an earthquake.\\n\\n The other horses danced and whinnied, and the shaking rattled carts.\\n\\n \"We need to move off the bridge, Lady Faile!\" Olver cried.\\n\\n \"The bridge is much too long for us to get to the other side before this ends\", Faile said calmly. She had suffered earthquakes in Saldaea before. \"We’d be more in danger of hurting ourselves in the scramble than we will be here. This bridge is Ogier work. We’re probably safer here than we’d be on solid ground\".\\n\\n Indeed, the earthquake passed without so much as a stone being loosed from the bridge. Faile brought her horses under control and started ahead again. The Light willing, the damage to the city wasn’t too bad. She didn’t know if earthquakes were common here. With Dragonmount nearby, there would at least be occasional rumblings, wouldn’t there?\\n\\n Still, the earthquake worried her. People spoke of the land becoming unstable, the groanings of the earth coming to match the breaking of the sky by lightning and thunder. She had heard more than one account of the spiderweb cracks that appeared in rocks, pure black, as if they extended on into eternity itself.\\n\\n Once the rest of the caravan left the city, Faile pulled her wagons up beside some mercenary bands waiting their turn at an Aes Sedai for Traveling. Faile could not afford to insist on preference; she had to avoid attention. So, nerve-racking though it was, she settled down to wait.\\n\\n Her caravan was last in line for the day. Eventually, Aravine came up to Faile’s wagon, and Olver scooted over to make room for her. She patted him on the head. A lot of women responded that way to Olver, and he did seem so innocent much of the time. Faile wasn’t convinced; she narrowed her eyes at Olver as he snuggled up beside Aravine. Mat seemed to have had a strong influence on the child.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m pleased with this shipment, my Lady\", Aravine said. \"With this canvas, we should have enough material to put tents over the heads of most men in the army. We are still going to need leather. We know that Queen Elayne marched her men hard, and we will be getting requests for new boots\". Faile nodded absently. A gateway ahead opened to Merrilor, and she could see the armies, still gathering. Over the last couple of days, they’d slowly limped back to lick their wounds. Three battlefronts, three disasters of varying degrees. Light. The arrival of the Sharans was devastating, as was the betrayals of the great captains, including Faile’s own father. The armies of the Light had lost well over a third of their forces.\\n\\n On the Field of Merrilor, commanders deliberated and their soldiers repaired armor and weapons, awaiting what would come. A final stand.\\n\\n \". . . will also need some more meat\", Aravine said. \"We should suggest some quick hunting trips using gateways over the next few days to see what we can find\".\\n\\n Faile nodded. It was a comfort, having Aravine. Though Faile still reviewed reports and visited the quartermasters, Aravine’s careful attention made the job much easier, like a good sergeant who had made certain his men were in shape before an inspection.\\n\\n \"Aravine\", Faile said. \"You haven’t ever taken one of the gateways to check on your family in Amadicia\".\\n\\n \"There is nothing for me there any longer, my Lady\".\\n\\n Aravine stubbornly refused to admit that she’d been a noble before being taken by the Shaido. Well, at least she didn’t act as some of the former gai’shain did, docile and submissive. If Aravine was determined to leave her past behind her, then Faile would gladly give her the chance. It was the least she owed the woman.\\n\\n As they talked, Olver climbed down to go chat with some of his \"uncles\" among the Redarms. Faile glanced to the side as Vanin rode past with two of the Band’s other scouts. He spoke jovially to them.\\n\\n You’re misreading that look of his, Faile told herself. There’s nothing suspicious about the man; you’re merely jumpy because of the Horn.\\n\\n Still, when Harnan came to ask if she needed anything—a member of the Band did that every half-hour—she asked him about Vanin.\\n\\n \"Vanin?\" Harnan said from horseback. \"Good fellow. He can chew your ear off griping at times, my Lady, but don’t let that sour you. He’s our best scout\".\\n\\n \"I can’t imagine how\", she said. \"I mean, he can’t move quickly or quietly with that bulk, can he?\"\\n\\n \"He’d surprise you, my Lady\", Harnan said with a laugh. \"I like to rib him, but he really is skilled\".\\n\\n \"Has he ever presented any disciplinary problems?\" Faile asked, trying to choose her words. \"Fighting? Lifting things from other men’s tents?\"\\n\\n \"Vanin?\" Harnan laughed. \"He’ll borrow your brandy if you let him, then return the flask mostly empty. And truth be told, he might have had a bit of thieving in his past, but I’ve never known him to fight. He’s a good man. You don’t need to worry about him\".\\n\\n Some thieving in his past? Harnan, though, looked like he didn’t want to talk about it any further. \"Thank you\", she said, but she remained worried.\\n\\n Harnan raised a hand to his head in a kind of salute, then rode off. It was three more hours before an Aes Sedai came to process them. Berisha strolled over, giving the caravan a critical inspection. She was hard of features and lean of figure. The other Aes Sedai working the Traveling ground had already returned to Tar Valon by this point, and the sun was dipping toward the horizon.\\n\\n \"Caravan of foodstuffs and canvas\", Berisha said, examining Faile’s ledger. \"Bound for the Field of Merrilor. We’ve sent them seven caravans today so far. Why another? I suspect the Caemlyn refugees could use this as much\".\\n\\n \"The Field of Merrilor is soon going to be a site of great battle\", Faile said, keeping her temper with difficulty. Aes Sedai did not like to be snapped at. \"I doubt we \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-194.html","bookId":1601,"book":{"id":1601,"title":"A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14)","description":"Storyline: A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14) \\n “And it came to pass in those days, as it had come before and would come again, that the Dark lay heavy on the land and weighed down the hearts of men, and the green things failed, and hope died.” From Charal Drianaan te Calamon, The Cycle of the Dragon. \\n In the Field of Merrilor the rulers of the nations gather to join behind Rand al’Thor, or to stop him from his plan to break the seals on the Dark One’s prison—which may be a sign of his madness, or the last hope of humankind.
