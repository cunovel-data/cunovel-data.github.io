A blackness.\\n\\n \"Rand\", Moiraine said, hand on his arm. \"The Dark One wells up against his bonds. Do not touch that blackness\".\\n\\n The figure stood and turned, Moridin’s now-familiar face reflecting Callandor\u0027s glow. Beside him on the ground lay a husk. Rand could explain it no other way. It was like the shell some insects leave behind when they grow, only it was in the shape of a man. A man with no eyes. One of the Myrddraal?\\n\\n Moridin looked to the husk, following Rand’s gaze. \"A vessel my master needed no longer\", Moridin said. Saa floated in the whites of his eyes, bouncing, shaking, moving with crazed vigor. \"It gave birth to what is behind me\".\\n\\n \"There is nothing behind you\".\\n\\n Moridin raised his sword before his face in a salute. \"Exactly\". Those eyes were nearly completely black.\\n\\n Rand waved for Moiraine and Nynaeve to stay a few steps back as he approached. \"You demand a duel? Here? Now? Elan, you know what I do is inevitable. Slowing me has no purpose\".\\n\\n \"No purpose, Lews Therin?\" Moridin laughed. \"If I weaken you even slightly, will my master’s task not be that much easier? No, I think I shall indeed stand in your way. And if I win, what then? Your victory is not assured. It never has been\".\\n\\n I win again, Lews Therin . . .\\n\\n \"You could step aside\", Rand said, raising Callandor; the glow of its light shifting off Moridin’s black steel sword. \"If my victory is not assured, neither is your fall. Let me pass. For once, make the choice you know you should\".\\n\\n Moridin laughed. \"Now? Now you beg me to return to the Light? I have been promised oblivion. Finally, nothing, a destruction of my entire being. An end. You will not steal that from me, Lews Therin! By my grave, you will not!\"\\n\\n Moridin came forward swinging.\\n\\n Lan executed Cherry Petal Kisses the Pond—not an easy task from horseback, as it was not a form designed for the saddle. His sword slashed into the neck of a Trolloc, just an inch into the creatures skin. That was enough to make fetid blood blossom in a spray. The bull-faced creature dropped its catchpole, reaching up to hold its neck, and let out a gurgling half-scream, half-groan.\\n\\n Lan danced Mandarb backward as a second Trolloc came for his side. He cut its arm off as he spun. The Trolloc stumbled from the blow, and Andere ran it through from behind.\\n\\n Andere moved his horse up beside Mandarb; over the din of battle, Lan could hear his friend panting. How long had they been fighting here at the battles front? Lan’s arms felt like lead on his shoulders.\\n\\n It hadn’t been this bad during the Blood Snow.\\n\\n \"Lan!\" Andere shouted. \"They keep coming!\"\\n\\n Lan nodded, then moved Mandarb back again as a pair of Trollocs shoved their way through corpses to attack. These two had catchpoles as well. That wasn’t uncommon for Trollocs; they realized that men on foot were far less dangerous to them than men on horseback. Still, it made Lan wonder if they were trying to capture him.\\n\\n He and Andere let the Trollocs come through and attack, as two members of the High Guard rode in from the side to distract their attention. The Trollocs came for Lan, and he lurched forward, swinging and cutting in half the shaft of each of their catchpoles.\\n\\n The beasts didn’t stop, reaching brutish fingers to try to pull him down. Lan could smell their putrid breath as he rammed his sword into the throat of one. How slowly his muscles moved! Andere had better be in position.\\n\\n Andere’s horse came in with a sudden gallop, slamming its armored flank into the second Trolloc, knocking it to the side. It stumbled, and the two mounted guardsmen butchered it with long-handled axes.\\n\\n Those men were both bloodied, as was Andere. As was Lan himself. He only vaguely remembered taking that thigh wound. He was growing so tired. He wasn’t in any condition to fight.\\n\\n \"We pull back\", he announced reluctantly. \"Let someone else take the point for now\". Lan and his men were leading the heavy cavalry at the tip of the fight, pressing against the Trollocs in a triangular formation to shear through and pushing them to the sides for the flanking attacks to crush.\\n\\n The others nodded, and he could sense their relief as he pulled himself and his fifty-something High Guards back. They retreated, and a group of Shienarans moved in to fill the point. Lan cleaned his sword, then sheathed it. Lightning rumbled above. Yes, those clouds did seem lower today. Like a hand, slowly pressing down upon the men as they died.\\n\\n Lightning bolts cracked the air nearby, one after another. Lan turned Mandarb sharply. There had been a lot of lightning today, but those had been too close together. He smelled smoke on the air.\\n\\n \"Dreadlords?\" Andere asked.\\n\\n Lan nodded, eyes searching for the attackers. All he could see was the lines of men fighting, the swarming mass of Trollocs driving forward in waves. He needed higher ground.\\n\\n Lan gestured at one of the hills, and heeled Mandarb toward it. Members of the rear guard watched him pass, giving a raised hand and a \"Dai Shan\". Their armor was stained with blood. The reserves had been rotated to the front, then back again, during the day.\\n\\n Mandarb plodded up the hill. Lan patted the horse, then dismounted and trudged beside the stallion. At the top, he stopped to survey the battle. Borderlander armies made spikelike indentations of silver and color in the Trolloc sea.\\n\\n So many. The Dreadlords had come out on their large platform again, the mechanism pulled by dozens of Trollocs as it rolled across the field. They needed height to see where to direct their attacks. Lan set his jaw, watching a series of lightning bolts strike the Kandori, hurling bodies into the air and opening a gap in their lines.\\n\\n Lan’s own channelers struck back, hurling lightning and fire at the advancing Trollocs to keep them from pouring through the hole in the Borderlander line. That would work for only so long. He had far fewer Aes Sedai and Asha’man than the Shadow had Dreadlords.\\n\\n \"Light\", said Prince Kaisel, riding up next to him. \"Dai Shan, if they rip enough holes in our lines . . \".\\n\\n \"Reserves are coming. There\", Andere said, pointing. He was still mounted, and Lan had to step forward to look around him to see what he was indicating. A group of Shienaran riders were making for the lines upon which the ligh \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-154.html","bookId":1601,"book":{"id":1601,"title":"A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14)","description":"Storyline: A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14) \\n “And it came to pass in those days, as it had come before and would come again, that the Dark lay heavy on the land and weighed down the hearts of men, and the green things failed, and hope died.” From Charal Drianaan te Calamon, The Cycle of the Dragon. \\n In the Field of Merrilor the rulers of the nations gather to join behind Rand al’Thor, or to stop him from his plan to break the seals on the Dark One’s prison—which may be a sign of his madness, or the last hope of humankind.
