Where there do be no Aes Sedai or Seanchan\".\\n\\n \"I wouldn’t run the kind of ship you prefer\".\\n\\n He regarded her flatly. \"I do know how to run an honest business, Leilwin. It would no be—\"\\n\\n She raised a hand, quieting him, then rested it on his shoulder. They stopped on the pathway. \"I know, my love. I know. I’m speaking words to distract, to set us spinning in a current that goes nowhere\".\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n That single word scratched at her like a splinter under a fingernail. Why . . . Why had she come all this way, traveling with Matrim Cauthon, putting herself dangerously near the Daughter of the Nine Moons? My people live with a grave misconception of the world, Bayle. In doing so, they create injustice\".\\n\\n \"They did reject you, Leilwin\", he said softly. You do no longer exist\".\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll always be one of them. My name was revoked, but not my blood\".\\n\\n \"I do be sorry for the insult\".\\n\\n She nodded curtly. \"I am still loyal to the Empress, may she live forever. But the damane . . . they are the very foundation for her rule. They are the means by which she creates order, by which she holds the Empire together. And the damane are a lie\".\\n\\n Suldam could channel. The talent could be learned. Now, months after she had discovered the truth, her mind could not encompass all of the implications. Another might have been more interested in the political advantage; another might have returned to Seanchan and used this to gain power.\\n\\n Almost, Leilwin wished she had done that. Almost.\\n\\n But the pleas of the suldam . . . growing to know those Aes Sedai, who were nothing like what she’d been taught . . .\\n\\n Something had to be done. And yet, in doing it, did she risk causing the entire Empire to collapse? Her movements must be considered very, very carefully, like the last rounds of a game of shal.\\n\\n The two continued to follow the line of servants in the dark; one Aes Sedai or another often sent servants for something they had left in the White Tower, so traveling back and forth was common—a good thing for Leilwin. They passed the perimeter of the Aes Sedai camp without being challenged.\\n\\n She was surprised at the ease of it until she spotted several men alongside the path. They were very easy to miss; something about them blended into the surroundings, particularly in the darkness. She noticed them only when one moved, breaking off from the others to fall into step a short distance behind her and Bayle.\\n\\n In seconds, it was obvious that he’d picked the two of them out. Perhaps it was the way they walked, the way they held themselves. They’d been careful to dress plainly, though Bayle’s beard would mark him as Illianer.\\n\\n Leilwin stopped—laying a hand on Bayle’s arm—and turned to confront the one following them. A Warder, she assumed from descriptions.\\n\\n The Warder stalked up to them. They were still near the perimeter of the camp, the tents organized in rings. She had noticed with discomfort that some of the tents glowed with a light too steady to come from candle or lamp.\\n\\n \"Ho\", Bayle said, raising a friendly hand to the Warder. \"We do be seeking an Aes Sedai named Nynaeve al’Meara. If she is not here, perhaps one named Elayne Trakand?\"\\n\\n \"Neither makes their camp here\", the Warder said. He was a long-armed man, and he moved with grace. His features, framed by long, dark hair, looked . . . unfinished. Chiseled from rock by a sculptor who had lost interest in the project partway through.\\n\\n \"Ah\", Bayle said. \"That do be our mistake, then. Could you point us to where they do be making camp? It do be a matter of some urgency, you see\". He spoke smoothly, easily. Bayle could be quite charming, when necessary. Much more so than Leilwin could.\\n\\n \"That depends\", the Warder said. \"Your companion, she wishes to find these Aes Sedai, too?\"\\n\\n \"She do—\" Bayle began, but the Warder held up a hand.\\n\\n \"I would hear it from her\", he said, inspecting Leilwin.\\n\\n \"It do be what I wish\", Leilwin said. \"My aged grandmother! These women, they did promise us payment, and I do mean to have it. Aes Sedai do not lie. Everyone do know this fact. If you will not take us to them, then provide someone who will!\"\\n\\n The Warder hesitated, eyes widening at the barrage of words. Then, blessedly, he nodded. \"This way\". He led them away from the center of the camp, but he no longer seemed suspicious.\\n\\n Leilwin let out a quiet breath and fell into step with Bayle behind the Warder. Bayle looked at her proudly, grinning so widely he’d certainly have given the two of them away if the Warder had looked back. She couldn’t help a hint of a smile herself.\\n\\n The Illianer accent had not come naturally to her, but both had agreed that her Seanchan tongue was dangerous, particularly when traveling among Aes Sedai. Bayle claimed that no true Illianer would accept her as one of them, but she was clearly good enough to fool an outsider.\\n\\n She felt relieved when they moved away from the Aes Sedai camp into the dark. Having two friends—they were friends, despite their troubles with one another—who were Aes Sedai did not mean she wanted to be inside a camp full of them. The Warder led them to an open area near the middle of the Field of Merrilor. There was a very large camp here, with a great number of small tents.\\n\\n \"Aiel\", Bayle said softly to her. \"There do be tens of thousands of them\".\\n\\n Interesting. Fearsome stories were told of Aiel, legends that could not all possibly be true. Still, the tales—if exaggerated—suggested that these were the finest warriors this side of the ocean. She would have welcomed sparring with one or two of them, had the situation been different. She rested a hand on the side of her pack; she’d stowed her cudgel in a long pocket on the side, easily within reach.\\n\\n They certainly were a tall folk, these Aiel. She passed some of them lounging by campfires, seemingly relaxed. Those eyes, however, watched more keenly than the Warders’ had. A dangerous people, ready for killing while relaxing beside fires. She could not make out the banners that flapped above this camp in the night sky.\\n\\n \"Which king or queen do rule this camp, Warder?\" she called.\\n\\n The man turned to her, his features lost in the night shadow. \"Your king, Illianer\".\\n\\n At her side, Bayle stiffened.\\n\\n My . . .\\n\\n The Dragon Reborn. She was proud that she didn’t miss a step as they walked, but it was a near thing. A man who could channel. That was worse, far w \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-8.html","bookId":1601,"book":{"id":1601,"title":"A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14)","description":"Storyline: A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14) \\n “And it came to pass in those days, as it had come before and would come again, that the Dark lay heavy on the land and weighed down the hearts of men, and the green things failed, and hope died.” From Charal Drianaan te Calamon, The Cycle of the Dragon. \\n In the Field of Merrilor the rulers of the nations gather to join behind Rand al’Thor, or to stop him from his plan to break the seals on the Dark One’s prison—which may be a sign of his madness, or the last hope of humankind.
