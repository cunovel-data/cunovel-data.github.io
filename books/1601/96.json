You don’t fight Slayer\". \"Very well\", Gaul said. \"I give my oath on it. I will not dance the spears with this man unless you order it\". Perrin sighed, imagining Gaul standing with his spears put away, letting Slayer kill him because of this oath. Light, but Aiel could be prickly. \"You can fight him if he attacks you\", Perrin said, \"but only as a means of escape. Don’t hunt him, and if I’m fighting him, stay out of the way. Understand?\" Gaul nodded. Perrin put a hand on the Aiel’s shoulder, then shifted them in the direction of the Black Tower. Perrin had never been there before, so he had to guess and try to find it. The first shift was off, taking them to a section of Andor where grass-covered hills seemed to dance in the churning winds. Perrin would have preferred to just leap from hilltop to hilltop, but he didn’t think Gaul was ready for that. He used shifting instead. After four or five tries, Perrin took them to a place where he spotted a translucent, faintly purple dome rising in the distance. \"What is it?\" Gaul asked. \"Our goal\", Perrin said. \"That is the thing keeping Grady and Neald from creating gateways to the Black Tower\". \"Just as we were afflicted in Ghealdan\". \"Yes\". Seeing that dome brought back memories, vivid ones, of wolves dying. Perrin suppressed them. Memories like that could lead to idle thoughts, here. He allowed himself a burning anger deep within, like the warmth of his hammer, but that was all. \"Let’s go\", Perrin said, shifting them down in front of the dome. It looked like glass. \"Pull me free if I collapse\", he said to Gaul, then stepped into the barrier. It felt as if he’d hit something incredibly cold. It sucked away his strength. He stumbled, but kept his mind on his goal. Slayer. Killer of wolves. Hopper’s murderer. Perrin straightened as his strength returned. This was easier than it had been last time; being in the wolf dream in the flesh did make him stronger. He didn’t have to worry about pulling himself into the dream too strongly, and leaving his body to die in the real world. He moved slowly through the barrier, as if through water, and stepped out onto the other side. Behind, Gaul reached out with a curious expression on his face, then tapped the dome wall with his index finger. Gaul immediately dropped to the ground, going limp like a doll. His spears and arrows tumbled away from his body, and he lay perfectly still, his chest not rising. Perrin reached through—his arm slow—and seized Gaul by the leg to pull him through. Once on the other side, Gaul gasped, then rolled over, groaning. He sat up, holding his head. Perrin quietly fetched the man’s arrows and spears for him. \"This is going to be a good experience for building our ji\", Gaul said. He stood up and rubbed his arm where he’d hit the ground. \"The Wise Ones call coming to this place as we do evil? It seems to me they would enjoy bringing men here to teach them\". Perrin eyed Gaul. He hadn’t realized that the man had heard him speaking to Edarra of the wolf dream. \"What did I do to deserve your loyalty, Gaul?\" Perrin said, mostly to himself. Gaul laughed. \"It is not anything you did\". \"What do you mean? I cut you down from that cage. That’s why you follow me\". \"That’s why I began following you\", Gaul said. \"It is not why I remained. Come, is there not a danger that we hunt?\" Perrin nodded, and Gaul veiled his face. Together, they walked beneath the dome, approaching the structure within. It was a goodly distance from the edge of one of these domes to the center, but Perrin didn’t want to jump and be surprised, so they continued on foot, crossing a landscape of open grasslands patched with groves of trees. They walked for about an hour before they spotted the walls. Tall and imposing, they looked like those around a large city. Perrin and Gaul walked up to them, Gaul scouting with great care, as if he expected to be fired upon at any moment. However, in the wolf dream, these walls wouldn’t be guarded. If Slayer were in here, he would lurk at the heart of the dome, at the center. And he’d probably have laid a trap. Perrin rested his hand on Gaul’s shoulder and brought them to the top of the wall in an instant. Gaul prowled to one side, crouching low and peeking into one of the covered guard posts. Perrin went to the inner edge of the wall, looking in. The Black Tower wasn’t as imposing as the outside implied: a distant village of huts and small houses, and beyond that a large building project. \"They’re arrogant, wouldn’t you say?\" a feminine voice asked. Perrin jumped, spinning, summoning his hammer to his hands and readying a brick wall around himself for protection. A short young woman with silver hair stood next to him, standing straight as if to try to appear taller than she was. She wore white clothing, tied at the waist with a silver belt. He didn’t recognize the face, but he did know her scent. \"Moonhunter\", Perrin said, almost a growl. \"Lanfear\". \"I\u0027m not allowed to use that name any longer\", she said, tapping one finger on the wall. \"He’s so strict with names\". Perrin backed away, glancing from side to side. Was she working with Slayer? Gaul appeared out of the guard post and froze, seeing her. Perrin held out a hand to stop him. Could he jump to Gaul and be away before she attacked? \"Moonhunter?\" Lanfear asked. \"Is that what the wolves call me? That’s not right, not at all. I don’t hunt the moon. The moon is mine already\". She leaned down, resting her arms on the chest-high battlement. \"What do you want?\" Perrin demanded. \"Vengeance\", she whispered. Then she looked at him. \"The same as you, Perrin\". \"I’m to believe you want Slayer dead too?\" \"Slayer? That orphan errand boy of Moridin’s? He doesn’t interest me. My vengeance will be against another\". \"Who?\" \"The one who caused my imprisonment\", she said softly, passionately. Suddenly, she looked toward the skies. Her eyes widened in alarm, and she vanished. Perrin passed his hammer from one hand to the other as Gaul crept forward, trying to watch all directions at once. \"What was that?\" he whispere","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-96.html","bookId":1601,"book":{"id":1601,"title":"A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14)","description":"Storyline: A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14) “And it came to pass in those days, as it had come before and would come again, that the Dark lay heavy on the land and weighed down the hearts of men, and the green things failed, and hope died.” From Charal Drianaan te Calamon, The Cycle of the Dragon.
