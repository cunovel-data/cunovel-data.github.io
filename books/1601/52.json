Gawyn will be our fifth when he returns\".\n Sitters behind suffered the decision in silence. They couldn’t complain about her taking her Warder for protection or her Keeper for support. The other three she’d chosen were widely considered among the most influential in the Tower, and together the four she brought included two Aes Sedai each from Salidar and the White Tower loyalists.\n The other rulers allowed Egwene to enter before them. All understood that this confrontation was, at its core, between Rand and Egwene. Or, rather, the Dragon and the Amyrlin Seat.\n There were no chairs inside the pavilion, though Rand hung saidin globes of light at the corners, and one of the Asha’man deposited a small table at the center. She did a quick count. Thirteen glowing globes.\n Rand stood facing her, arms behind his back, hand clasping his other forearm as had become his habit. Min stood at his side, one hand on his arm.\n \"Mother\", he said, nodding his head.\n So he would pretend respect, would he? Egwene nodded back. \"Lord Dragon\".\n The other rulers and their small retinues filed in, many doing so with timidity until Elayne swept in, the sorrow on her face lightening as Rand smiled warmly at her. The wool-headed woman was still impressed with Rand, pleased with how he’d managed to bully everyone into coming here. Elayne considered it a matter of pride when he did well.\n And you don’t feel a small measure of pride? Egwene asked herself. Rand al’Thor, once simple village boy and your near-betrothed, now the most powerful man in the world? You don’t feel proud of what he’s done?\n Perhaps a little.\n The Borderlanders entered, led by King Easar of Shienar, and there was nothing timid about them. The Domani were led by an older man that Egwene did not know.\n \"Alsalam\", Silviana whispered, sounding surprised. \"He has returned\".\n Egwene frowned. Why hadn’t any of her informants told her he had shown up? Light. Did Rand know that the White Tower had tried to take him into custody? Egwene herself had discovered that fact only a few days before, buried in a pile of Elaida’s papers.\n Cadsuane entered, and Rand nodded to her, as if giving permission. She didn’t bring five, but neither did he seem to require her to be counted among Egwene’s five. That struck her as a bothersome precedent. Perrin stepped in with his wife, and they stayed to the side. Perrin folded his tree-trunk arms, wearing his new hammer at his belt. He was far easier to read than Rand was. He was worried, but he trusted Rand. Nynaeve did, too, burn her. She took her position near Perrin and Faile.\n The Aiel clan chiefs and Wise Ones entered in a large mass—Rand’s \"Bring only five\" probably meant that each clan chief could bring five. Some Wise Ones, including Sorilea and Amys, made their way to Egwene’s side of the tent.\n Light bless them, Egwene thought, releasing a held breath. Rand’s eyes flickered toward the women, and Egwene caught a tightening of his lips. He was surprised that all the Aiel didn’t back him, each and every one.\n King Roedran of Murandy was one of the last to enter the tent, and Egwene noticed something curious as he did. Several of Rand’s Asha’man—Narishma, Flinn, Naeff—moved in behind Roedran. Others, near Rand, looked as alert as cats who had seen a wolf wander by.\n Rand stepped over to the shorter, wider man and looked down into his eyes. Roedran stuttered for a moment, then started wiping his brow with a handkerchief. Rand continued to stare at him.\n \"What is it?\" Roedran demanded. \"You’re the Dragon Reborn, so they say. I do not know that I\u0027d have let you—\"\n \"Stop\", Rand said, raising a finger.\n Roedran quieted immediately.\n \"Light burn me\", Rand said. \"You’re not him, are you?\"\n \"Who?\" Roedran asked.\n Rand turned away from him, waving his hand to make Narishma and the others stand down. They did so reluctantly. \"I thought for certain . . \". Rand said, shaking his head. \"Where are you?\"\n \"Who?\" Roedran asked loudly, almost squeaking.\n Rand ignored him. The flaps to the pavilion had finally stilled, everyone inside. \"So\", Rand said. \"We are all here. Thank you for coming\".\n \"It’s not like we did have much of a bloody choice\", Gregorin grumbled. He’d brought a handful of Illianer nobility with him as his five, all members of the Council of Nine. \"We did be caught between you and the White Tower itself. Light burn us\".\n \"You know by now\", Rand continued, \"that Kandor has fallen and Caemlyn has been taken by the Shadow. The last remnants of Malkier are under assault at Tarwin’s Gap. The end is upon us\".\n \"Then why are we standing here, Rand al’Thor?\" demanded King Paitar of Arafel. The aging man had only a thin ribbon of gray hair remaining on his head, but he was still broad-shouldered and intimidating. \"Let us put an end to this posturing and be to it, man! There is fighting to be done\".\n \"I promise you fighting, Paitar\", Rand said softly. \"All that you can stomach, and then some. Three thousand years ago, I met the Dark Ones forces in battle. We had the wonders of the Age of Legends, Aes Sedai who could do things that would make your mind reel, ter’angreal that could enable people to fly and make them immune to blows. We still barely won. Have you considered that? We face the Shadow in much the same state as it was then, with Forsaken who have not aged. But we are not the same people, not by far\".\n The tent fell silent. Flaps blew in the breeze.\n \"What are you saying, Rand al’Thor?\" Egwene said, folding her arms. \"That we are doomed?\"\n \"I’m saying we need to plan\", Rand said, \"and present a unified attack. That we did poorly last time, and it nearly cost us the war. We each thought we knew the best way to go\". He met Egwene’s eyes. \"In those days, every man and woman considered themselves to be the leader on the field. An army of generals. That is why we nearly lost. That is what left us with the taint, the Breaking, the madness. I was as guilty of it as anyone. Perhaps the most guilty.\n \"I will not have that happen again. I will not save this world only to have it broken a second time! I will not die for the nations of humanity, only to have them turn upon one another the moment the last Trolloc falls. You’re planning it. Light burn me, I \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-52.html","bookId":1601,"book":{"id":1601,"title":"A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14)","description":"Storyline: \n A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14) \n “And it came to pass in those days, as it had come before and would come again, that the Dark lay heavy on the land and weighed down the hearts of men, and the green things failed, and hope died.” From Charal Drianaan te Calamon, The Cycle of the Dragon. \n In the Field of Merrilor the rulers of the nations gather to join behind Rand al’Thor, or to stop him from his plan to break the seals on the Dark One’s prison—which may be a sign of his madness, or the last hope of humankind.
