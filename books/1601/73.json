The units that had just rotated onto the field needed help.\\n\\n I will consider it, Lan thought. Pushing aside his fatigue, he dashed for the horselines where the groom would have delivered Mandarb.\\n\\n He didn’t need to ride on this sortie. He had just gotten off one. He decided to go anyway, and caught himself yelling for Bulen to prepare a horse, and felt a fool. Light, but Lan had grown accustomed to the man’s help.\\n\\n Agelmar is right, Lan thought as the grooms fell over themselves, saddling Mandarb. The stallion was skittish, sensing his mood. They will follow me. Like Bulen did. Leading them to death in the name of a fallen kingdom . . . leading myself to the same death . . . how is that any different from Tenobia’s attitude?\\n\\n Before long, he was galloping back toward the defensive lines to find the Trollocs almost breaking through. He joined the rally, and this night, they held. Eventually, they would fail to do so. What then?\\n\\n Then . . . then he would abandon Malkier again, and do what had to be done.\\n\\n Egwene’s force had gathered at the southern portion of the Field of Merrilor. They had been slated to Travel to Kandor once Elayne’s force had been dispatched to Caemlyn. Rand’s armies had not yet entered Thakan’dar, but had instead moved to staging areas on the northern part of the Field, where supplies could be assembled more easily. He claimed the time wasn’t quite right for his assault; the Light send he was making progress with the Seanchan.\\n\\n Moving so many people was a tremendous headache. Aes Sedai created gateways in a huge line, like the doorways along one side of a grand feast hall. Soldiers bunched up, waiting their turn to pass through. Many of the strongest channelers were not involved in this task; they would be channeling in combat soon enough, and creating gateways would only consume needed strength before the important work had begun.\\n\\n The soldiers made way for the Amyrlin, of course. With the foreguard in place and a camp established on the other side, it was time for her to cross. She had spent the morning meeting with the Hall as they went over the supply reports and terrain assessments. She was glad she had allowed the Hall to take a larger role in the war; there was a great deal of wisdom to the Sitters, many of whom had lived well over a century.\\n\\n \"I don’t like being forced to wait this long\", Gawyn said, riding beside her.\\n\\n She eyed him.\\n\\n \"I trust General Bryne’s battlefield assessment, as does the Hall\", Egwene said as they rode past the Illianer Companions, each man’s brilliant breastplate worked with the Nine Bees of Illian on the front. They saluted her, faces hidden behind their conical helmets, barred at the front.\\n\\n She wasn’t certain she liked having them in her army—they would be more loyal to Rand than to her—but Bryne had insisted on it. He said that her force, though enormous, lacked an elite group like the Companions.\\n\\n \"I still say we should have left sooner\", Gawyn said as the two of them passed through the gateway to the border of Kandor.\\n\\n \"It has only been a few days\".\\n\\n \"A few days while Kandor burns\". She could sense his frustration. She could also feel that he loved her, fiercely. He was her husband, now. The marriage had been performed by Silviana in a simple ceremony the night before. It still felt odd to know that Egwene had authorized her own wedding. When you were the highest authority, what else could you do?\\n\\n As they moved into the camp on the Kandori border, Bryne rode by, giving terse orders to scouting patrols. When he reached Egwene, he climbed out of the saddle and bowed low, kissing her ring. He then remounted and continued. He was very respectful, considering that he’d essentially been bullied into leading this army. Of course, he’d made his demands and they had been met, so perhaps he’d bullied them as well. Leading the White Tower’s armies had been an opportunity for him; no man liked being put out to pasture. The great captain shouldn’t have found himself there in the first place.\\n\\n Egwene noted Siuan riding at Bryne’s side and smiled in satisfaction. He is bound tightly to us now.\\n\\n Egwene surveyed the hills on the southeastern border of Kandor. Though they lacked greenery—like most places in the world now—their peaceful serenity gave no hint that the country beyond them burned. The capital, Chachin, was now little more than rubble. Before withdrawing to join the fight with the other Borderlanders, Queen Ethenielle had turned over rescue operations to Egwene and the Hall. They had done what they could, sending scouts through gateways along major roadways looking for refugees, then bringing them away to safety—if anywhere could be called safe now.\\n\\n The main Trolloc army had left the burning cities and was now moving southeast toward the hills and the river that made up Kandor\u0027s border with Arafel.\\n\\n Silviana rode up beside Egwene, opposite Gawyn. She spared him only a glare—those two really would have to stop snapping at one another; it was growing tiresome—before kissing Egwene’s ring. \"Mother\".\\n\\n \"Silviana\".\\n\\n \"We have received an update from Elayne Sedai\".\\n\\n Egwene allowed herself a smile. Both of them, independently, had taken to calling Elayne by her White Tower title as opposed to her civil title. \"And?\"\\n\\n \"She suggests that we set up a location where the wounded can be sent for Healing\".\\n\\n \"We’d talked about having the Yellows move from battlefield to battlefield\", Egwene said.\\n\\n \"Elayne Sedai is worried about exposing the Yellows to attack\", Silviana said. \"She wants a stationary hospital\".\\n\\n \"That would be more efficient, Mother\", Gawyn said, rubbing his chin. \"Finding the wounded after a battle is a brutal affair. I don’t know what I’d think of sending sisters to comb through the dead. This war could stretch weeks, even months, if the great captains are right. Eventually, the Shadow is going to start picking off Aes Sedai on the field\".\\n\\n \"Elayne Sedai was quite . . . insistent\", Silviana said. Her face was a mask, her tone steady, yet she also managed to convey severe displeasure. Silviana was proficient at that.\\n\\n I helped put Elayne in charge, Egwene reminded herself. Refusing her would set a bad precedent. As would obeying her. Perhaps they could remain friends through it.\\n\\n \"Elayne Sedai shows wisdom\", Egwene said. \"Tell Romanda that it must be done this way. Have the entire Yellow Ajah gather for Healing, but not \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-73.html","bookId":1601,"book":{"id":1601,"title":"A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14)","description":"Storyline: A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14) \\n “And it came to pass in those days, as it had come before and would come again, that the Dark lay heavy on the land and weighed down the hearts of men, and the green things failed, and hope died.” From Charal Drianaan te Calamon, The Cycle of the Dragon. \\n In the Field of Merrilor the rulers of the nations gather to join behind Rand al’Thor, or to stop him from his plan to break the seals on the Dark One’s prison—which may be a sign of his madness, or the last hope of humankind.
