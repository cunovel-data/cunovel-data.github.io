She rose.\n \"Berelain?\" he asked.\n She turned back to him.\n \"Faile\", he said. \"What of Faile?\"\n Her anxiety sharpened. No.\n \"Her supply caravan was destroyed in a bubble of evil, Perrin\", Berelain said softly. \"I’m sorry\".\n \"Was her body recovered?\" he forced himself to ask.\n \"No\".\n \"Then she still lives\".\n \"It—\"\n \"She still lives!\" Perrin insisted. He would have to assume that was true. If he didn’t . . .\n \"There is, of course, hope\", she said, then walked to Uno, who was flexing his Healed arm, and nodded for him to join her as she left the room. Janina was puttering around the washstand. Perrin could still hear moaning in the hallways outside, and the place smelled of healing herbs and of pain.\n Light, he thought. Faile’s caravan had carried the Horn. Did the Shadow now have it?\n And Gaul. He had to return to Gaul. He’d left the man in the wolf dream, guarding Rand’s back. If Perrin’s exhaustion was any guide, Gaul couldn’t hold much longer.\n Perrin felt as if he could sleep for weeks. Janina returned to his bedside, then shook her head. \"There is no good purpose in trying to force yourself to hold your eyes open, Perrin Aybara\".\n \"I have too much to do, Janina. Please. I need to return to the battlefield and—\"\n \"You will stay here, Perrin Aybara. You are of no use to anyone in your state, and will gain no ji by trying to prove otherwise. If the blacksmith who brought you here knew I’d let you stumble off and die on the battlefield, I believe he’d come try to hang me out the window by my heels\". She hesitated. \"And that one . . . I almost think he could manage it\".\n \"Master Luhhan\", Perrin said, recalling faintly those moments before he blacked out. \"He was there. He found me?\"\n \"He saved your life\", Janina said. \"That man threw you on his back and ran you to an Aes Sedai for a gateway. You were seconds from death when he arrived. Considering your size, just lifting you is some feat\".\n \"I don’t really need sleep\", Perrin said, feeling his eyes droop. \"I need . . . I need to get . . \".\n \"I’m sure you do\", Janina said.\n Perrin let his eyes shut. That would convince her that he was going to do as she said. Then, when she left, he could stand up.\n \"I’m sure you do\", Janina repeated, her voice growing softer for some reason.\n Sleep, he thought. I\u0027m falling asleep. Again, he saw the three paths before himself. This time, one led to ordinary sleep, another to the wolf dream while sleeping, the path he usually took.\n And between them, a third path. The wolf dream in the flesh.\n He was sorely tempted, but in the moment, he chose not to take that path. He chose ordinary sleep, as—in a moment of understanding—he knew that his body would die without it.\n Androl lay, gasping for breath, staring up at the sky somewhere far from the battlefield, following their flight from the top of the Heights.\n That attack . . . it had been so powerful.\n What was that? he sent to Pevara.\n It wasn\u0027t Taim, she replied, standing up, dusting off her skirts. I think it was Demandred.\n I purposefully brought us to a place far from where he was fighting.\n Yes. How dare he move and interfere with the group of channelers attacking his forces?\n Androl sat up, groaning. You know, Pevara, you are unusually smart-lipped, for an Aes Sedai.\n He was surprised by her amusement. You don’t know Aes Sedai nearly as well as you assume. She walked over to check on Emarin’s wounds.\n Androl took a deep breath, filled with the scents of autumn. Fallen leaves. Stagnant water. An autumn that had come too early. Their hillside looked down on a valley where, in defiance of the way the world was going, some farmers had tilled the earth in large squares.\n Nothing had grown.\n Nearby, Theodrin pulled herself up. \"It’s madness back there\", she said, her face flushed.\n Androl could feel Pevara’s disapproval. The girl should not have been so free with her emotions; she hadn’t learned proper Aes Sedai control yet.\n She isn’t a proper Aes Sedai, Pevara sent him, reading his thoughts. Regardless of what the Amyrlin claims. She hasn’t been through the testing yet.\n Theodrin seemed to know what Pevara thought, and the two kept their distance from one another. Pevara Healed Emarin, who took it stoically. Theodrin Healed a cut on Jonneth’s arm. He seemed bemused at the motherly ministration.\n She’ll have him bonded before long, Pevara sent him. Notice how she let one of the other women take her one of the fifty, then started following him about? We’ve barely been rid of her since the Black Tower.\n What if he bonds her back? Androl sent.\n Then we’ll see if what you and I have is unique or not. Pevara hesitated. We are stumbling upon things that have never been known.\n He met her eyes. She was referring to whatever had happened during their linking this last time. She had opened a gateway, but had done it as he would have.\n We’re going to need to try that again, he sent her.\n Shortly, she said, Delving Emarin to be certain her Healing had taken.\n \"I am quite all right, Pevara Sedai\", he said, courteous as always. \"And if I might note, you seem as if you could use some Healing of your own\".\n She looked down at the burned cloth on her arm. She was still timid about letting a man Heal her, but also annoyed at her own timidity.\n \"Thank you\", she said, her voice level as she let him touch her arm and channel.\n Androl unhooked the small tin cup from his belt, and absently lifted his hand, fingers downward. He pressed his fingers as if pinching something between them, and when he spread them, a small gateway opened in the middle. Water poured out, filling the cup.\n Pevara sat down beside him, accepting the cup as he offered it. She drank, then sighed. \"As cool as mountain springwater\".\n \"That’s what it is\", Androl said.\n \"That reminds me, I’ve been meaning to ask you something. How do you do that?\"\n \"Do this?\" he said. \"It’s just a small gateway\".\n \"That’s not what I mean. Androl, you just got here. You couldn’t possibly have had time to memorize this area well enough to open a gateway to some mountain spring hund \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-229.html","bookId":1601,"book":{"id":1601,"title":"A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14)","description":"Storyline: \n A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14) \n “And it came to pass in those days, as it had come before and would come again, that the Dark lay heavy on the land and weighed down the hearts of men, and the green things failed, and hope died.” From Charal Drianaan te Calamon, The Cycle of the Dragon. \n In the Field of Merrilor the rulers of the nations gather to join behind Rand al’Thor, or to stop him from his plan to break the seals on the Dark One’s prison—which may be a sign of his madness, or the last hope of humankind.
