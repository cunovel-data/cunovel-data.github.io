The people he saw coming through the gateways were mostly children and the elderly, and some matrons who had remained back to care for the young.\\n\\n \"Pardon\", Tam said, \"but this is a killing field!\"\\n\\n \"So I tried to explain\", Berelain said, a hint of exasperation in her voice. \"They claim they can be of use. Better than waiting out the Last Battle huddled together on the road to Whitebridge, so they say\".\\n\\n Tam watched, frowning, as children scattered onto the field. His stomach lurched at them investigating the gruesome dead, and many did shy back at first. Others began picking through the fallen, looking for signs of those people who were still alive and could be Healed. A few aged soldiers who had been set to guard the refugees went among them, watching for Trollocs that weren’t quite dead.\\n\\n Women and children began to pick arrows out from among the fallen. That would be helpful. Very helpful. With surprise, Tam saw hundreds of Tinkers pour out of one gateway. They went searching for the wounded under the direction of several Yellow sisters.\\n\\n Tam found himself nodding. It still worried him, allowing the children to see such sights. Well, he thought, they’ll see a worse sight if we fail here. If they wanted to be of use, they should be allowed.\\n\\n \"Tell me, Tam al’Thor\", Berelain asked, \"is . . . Galad Damodred well?\"\\n\\n \"I see his men here, but not his banner\".\\n\\n \"He was called to other duties, my Lady First\", Tam said. \"Downriver. I haven’t heard from him in hours, I’m afraid\".\\n\\n \"Ah. Well, let’s Heal and feed your men. Perhaps word of Lord Damodred will be forthcoming\".\\n\\n Elayne touched Gareth Bryne’s cheek softly. She closed his eyes, one, then the other, before nodding to the soldiers who had found his body. They carried Bryne away, legs dangling over the edge of his shield, head hanging down on the other side.\\n\\n \"He just went riding off, screaming\", Birgitte said. \"Right into the enemy lines. There was no stopping him\".\\n\\n \"Siuan is dead\", Elayne said, feeling an almost overpowering sense of loss. Siuan. . . . Siuan had always been so strong. With effort, Elayne stilled her emotions. She had to keep her attention on the battle. \"Is there word from the command post?\"\\n\\n \"The camp at Dashar Knob has been abandoned\", Birgitte said. \"I don’t know where Cauthon is. The Seanchan have forsaken us\".\\n\\n \"Raise my banner high\", Elayne said. \"Until we hear from Mat, I’m taking command of this battlefield. Bring forward my advisors\".\\n\\n Birgitte moved to give the orders. Elayne’s Guardswomen watched, shuffling nervously, as the Trollocs pushed against the Andorans at the river. They’d totally filled the corridor between Heights and bogs, and threatened to spill out on to Shienaran soil. Part of Egwene’s army had hit the Trollocs from the other side of the corridor, which had taken some pressure off her own troops for a time; but more Trollocs had attacked from above, and it looked as if Egwene’s men were getting the worst of it.\\n\\n Elayne had had solid lessons in battlefield tactics, though little experience on the field, and she could see how badly things were going. Yes, she had received news that the Trollocs’ position upriver had been destroyed by the arrival of Lan and the Borderlanders. But that brought scant relief with the situation here at the ford.\\n\\n The sun began to slip beneath the horizon. The Trollocs made no sign of pulling back, and her soldiers reluctantly began to light bonfires and torches. Organizing her men into square formations made for better defense, but it meant giving up any hope of pushing forward. The Aiel fought here as well, as did the Cairhienin. But those pike squares were the core of their battle plan.\\n\\n They’re slowly surrounding us, she thought. If the Trollocs did so, they could squeeze until the Andorans popped. Light, this is bad.\\n\\n The sun made a sudden blazing fire behind the horizon clouds. With night, the Trollocs gained another advantage. The air had grown cold in the advent of darkness. Her early assumptions that this battle would last days now seemed silly. The Shadow pushed with all of its might. Humankind did not have days remaining, but hours.\\n\\n \"Majesty\", Captain Guybon said, riding up with her commanders. Their dented armor and bloodied tabards proved that nobody, not even the senior officers, could be spared from direct fighting.\\n\\n \"Advice\", Elayne said, looking at him, Theodohr—commander of the cavalry—and Birgitte, who was Captain-General.\\n\\n \"Retreat?\" Guybon asked.\\n\\n \"Do you really think we could disengage?\" Birgitte replied.\\n\\n Guybon hesitated, then shook his head.\\n\\n \"Right, then\", Elayne said. \"How do we win?\"\\n\\n \"We hold\", said Theodohr. \"We hope the White Tower can win their fight against the Sharan channelers and come to our aid\".\\n\\n \"I don’t like just sitting here\", Birgitte said. \"It—\"\\n\\n A blazing beam of white-hot fire sliced through Elayne’s guards, vaporizing dozens of them. Guybon’s horse vanished beneath him, though he narrowly missed being hit himself. Elayne’s horse reared.\\n\\n Swearing, she wrestled her mount under control. That had been balefire!\\n\\n \"Lews Therin!\" A power-enhanced voice rang over the field. \"I hunt a woman you love! Come to me, coward! Fight!\"\\n\\n The earth exploded near Elayne, heaving her standard-bearer into the air, the flag bursting into flames. This time Elayne was thrown from horseback, and she hit hard, grunting.\\n\\n My babes! She groaned, rolling over as hands grabbed her. Birgitte. The woman hauled Elayne into the saddle behind her, helped by several Guards-women.\\n\\n \"Can you channel?\" Birgitte asked. \"No. Never mind. They’ll be watching for that. Celebrain, raise another banner! Ride downriver with a squadron of Guards. I will take the Queen the other way!\"\\n\\n The woman standing beside Birgitte’s horse saluted. It was a death sentence! \"Birgitte, no\", Elayne said.\\n\\n \"Demandred has decided you’ll draw out the Dragon Reborn for him\", Birgitte said, turning her horse. \"I’m not about to let that happen. Hya!\" She pushed her horse into a gallop as lightning struck Elayne’s guards, blowing bodies into the air.\\n\\n Elayne ground her teeth. Her armies were in danger of being overwhelmed, surrounded—all while Demandred laid down blast after blast of balefire, lightning and weaves of Earth. That man was as dang \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-248.html","bookId":1601,"book":{"id":1601,"title":"A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14)","description":"Storyline: A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14) \\n “And it came to pass in those days, as it had come before and would come again, that the Dark lay heavy on the land and weighed down the hearts of men, and the green things failed, and hope died.” From Charal Drianaan te Calamon, The Cycle of the Dragon. \\n In the Field of Merrilor the rulers of the nations gather to join behind Rand al’Thor, or to stop him from his plan to break the seals on the Dark One’s prison—which may be a sign of his madness, or the last hope of humankind.
