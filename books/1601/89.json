Her face and hair were wet. As Rand watched, she gasped and sank, flailing in the crystalline water.\n She came up a moment later, gasping.\n \"Hello, Mierin\", Rand said softly. His hand formed into a fist. He would not jump into that water to rescue her. This was a dreamshard. That pool could actually be water, but more likely it represented something else.\n His arrival seemed to buoy her, and her vigorous thrashings became more effective. \"Lews Therin\", she said, wiping her face with one hand, panting.\n Light! Where was his peace? He felt like a child again, a boy who thought Baerlon the grandest city ever built. Yes, her face was different, but faces were no longer of much matter to him. She was still the same person.\n Of all the Forsaken, only Lanfear had chosen her new name. She had always wanted one of those.\n He remembered. He remembered. Walking into grand parties with her on his arm. Her laughter over the music. Their nights alone. He had not wanted to remember making love to another woman, particularly not to one of the Forsaken, but he could not pick and choose what was in his mind.\n Those memories mixed with his own, when he had desired her as the Lady Selene. A foolish, youthful lust. He no longer felt these things, but the memories of them remained.\n \"You can free me, Lews Therin\", Lanfear said. \"He has claimed me. Must I beg? He has claimed me!\"\n \"You pledged yourself to the Shadow, Mierin\", Rand said. \"This is your reward. You expect pity from me?\"\n A dark something reached up and wrapped around her legs, yanking her down into the abyss again. Despite his words, Rand found himself stepping forward, as if to leap into the pool.\n He held himself back. He finally felt like a whole person again, after a long fight. That gave him strength, but in his peace was a weakness—the weakness he had always feared. The weakness that Moiraine had rightfully spotted in him. The weakness of compassion.\n He needed it. Like a helmet needed a hole through which to see. Both could be exploited. He admitted to himself that it was true.\n Lanfear surfaced, sputtering, looking helpless. \"Must I beg?\" she said again.\n \"I don’t think you are capable of it\".\n She lowered her eyes. \" . . . Please?\" she whispered.\n Rand’s insides twisted. He had fought through darkness himself in seeking the Light. He had given himself a second chance; should he not give one to another?\n Light! He wavered, remembering what it had felt like in that moment seizing the True Power. That agony and that thrill, that power and that horror. Lanfear had given herself to the Dark One. But in a way, Rand had as well.\n He looked into her eyes, searching them, knowing them. Finally, Rand shook his head. \"You’ve grown better at this kind of deception, Mierin. But not good enough\".\n Her expression darkened. In a moment, the pool was gone, replaced by a stone floor. Lanfear sat there, cross-legged, in her silver-white dress. Wearing her new face, but still the same.\n \"So you are back\", she said, sounding not entirely pleased. \"Well, I am no longer forced to deal with a simple farmboy. That is some small blessing\".\n Rand snorted, entering the chamber. She was still imprisoned—he could sense a darkening around her, like a dome of shadow, and he stayed outside of it. The pool, however—the act of drowning—had been mere theatrics. She was prideful, but was not above maintaining a weak front when the situation required it. If he’d been able to embrace Lews Therin’s memories earlier, Rand would never have been fooled so easily by her in the Waste.\n \"Then I shall address you not as a damsel in need of a hero\", Lanfear said, eyeing him as he walked around her prison, \"but as an equal, seeking asylum\".\n \"An equal?\" Rand said, laughing. \"Since when have you ever considered anyone your equal, Mierin?\"\n \"You care nothing for my captivity?\"\n \"It pains me\", Rand said, \"but no more than it pained me when you swore yourself to the Shadow. Did you know I was there, when you revealed it? You did not see me, as I did not want to be seen, but I was watching. Light, Mierin, you swore to kill me\".\n \"Did I mean it?\" she asked, turning to look him in the eyes.\n Had she? . . . No, she had not meant it. Not then. Lanfear did not kill people that she thought would be useful, and she had always considered him useful.\n \"We shared something special, once\", she said. \"You were my—\"\n \"I was an ornament to you!\" Rand snapped. He breathed deeply, trying to calm himself. Light, but it was hard around her. \"The past is done. I care nothing for it, and would gladly give you a second chance at the Light.\n \"Unfortunately, I know you. You’re just doing it again. Playing us all, including the Dark One himself. You care nothing for the Light. You care only for power, Mierin. You honestly want me to believe that you’ve changed?\"\n \"You do not know me so well as you think that you do\", she said, watching him as he rounded the perimeter of her prison. \"You never did\".\n \"Then prove it to me\", Rand said, stopping. \"Show me your mind, Mierin. Open it to me completely. Give me control over you here, in this place of mastered dreams. If your intentions are pure, I will free you\".\n \"What you ask is forbidden\".\n Rand laughed. \"When has that ever stopped you?\"\n She seemed to consider it; she must actually have been worried about her imprisonment. Once, she would have laughed at a suggestion such as this. Since this was, ostensibly, a place where he had complete control, if she gave him leave, he could strip her down, delve within her mind.\n \"I . . \". Lanfear said.\n He stepped forward, right to the lip of the prison. That tremble in her voice . . . that felt real. The first genuine emotion from her.\n Light, he thought, searching her eyes. Is she actually going to do it?\n \"I cannot\", she said. \"I cannot\". She said it the second time more softly. Rand exhaled. He found his hand shaking. So close. So close to the Light, like a feral cat in the night, stalking back and forth before the fire-lit barn! He found himself angry, angrier than before. Always, she did this! Flirting with what was right, but always choosing her own path.\n \"I am done with you, Mierin\", Rand said, turning away and walking from the cham \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-89.html","bookId":1601,"book":{"id":1601,"title":"A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14)","description":"Storyline: \n A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14) \n “And it came to pass in those days, as it had come before and would come again, that the Dark lay heavy on the land and weighed down the hearts of men, and the green things failed, and hope died.” From Charal Drianaan te Calamon, The Cycle of the Dragon. \n In the Field of Merrilor the rulers of the nations gather to join behind Rand al’Thor, or to stop him from his plan to break the seals on the Dark One’s prison—which may be a sign of his madness, or the last hope of humankind.
