I wonder how long it’s been since a meeting of this scale occurred. Nearly every nation was represented, and then some, considering the Sea Folk and the Aiel. Only Murandy, Arad Doman and the Seanchan-held lands were missing.\\n\\n The last of the Sitters finally mounted and pulled up beside her. Eager to move forward, but not daring to show it, Egwene started a slow ride toward the meeting place. Bryne’s soldiers fell in and formed an escort of tromping boots and pikes held high. Their white tabards were emblazoned with the Flame of Tar Valon, but they did not outshine the Aes Sedai. The way they marched accented the women at their center. Other armies relied on the strength of arms. The White Tower had something better.\\n\\n Each army converged on the meeting place, the center of the field, where Rand had ordered no tents erected. So many armies together on ground perfect for a charge. This had better not go wrong.\\n\\n Elayne set precedent by leaving the vast bulk of her force halfway there, continuing on with a smaller guard of about a hundred men. Egwene did the same. Other leaders began to trickle forward, their retinues coming to rest in a large ring around the central field.\\n\\n Sunlight shone down upon Egwene as she approached the center. She couldn’t help but notice the large, perfectly broken circle of clouds above the field. Rand did affect things in strange ways. He needed no announcement to say that he was in attendance, no banner. The clouds pulled back and sunlight shone down when he was near.\\n\\n It did not seem that he’d arrived at the center yet, however. She met up with Elayne. \"Elayne, I’m sorry\", she said, not for the first time.\\n\\n The golden-haired woman kept her eyes forward. \"The city is lost, but the city is not the nation. We must have this meeting, but do so quickly, so that I can return to Andor. Where is Rand?\"\\n\\n \"Taking his time\", Egwene said. \"He’s always been like that\".\\n\\n \"I have spoken to Aviendha\", Elayne said, her bay horse shifting and snorting. \"She spent last night with him, but he wouldn’t tell her what he intends this day\".\\n\\n \"He has mentioned demands\", Egwene said, watching the rulers gather with their retinues. Darlin Sisnera, King of Tear, was first. He would support her, for all the fact that he owed Rand his crown. The Seanchan threat still bothered him deeply. The middle-aged man with a dark, pointed beard was not particularly handsome, but self-composed and sure of himself. He bowed from horseback to Egwene, and she held out her ring.\\n\\n He hesitated, then dismounted and came forward, bowing his head and kissing the ring. \"The Light illumine you, Mother\".\\n\\n \"I am glad to see you here, Darlin\".\\n\\n \"So long as your promise holds. Gateways to my homeland should the moment require it\".\\n\\n \"It will be done\".\\n\\n He bowed again, eyeing a man riding up toward Egwene from the other side. Gregorin, Steward of Illian, was Darlin’s equal in many ways-- but not all. Rand had named Darlin Steward of Tear, but the High Lords had asked for him to be crowned king. Gregorin remained merely a Steward. The tall man had lost weight recently, his round face—with its customary Illianer beard—starting to look sunken. He didn’t wait for Egwene to prod him; he swung from his horse and seized her hand, executing a flourishing bow and a kiss to the ring.\\n\\n \"I’m pleased the two of you could put aside differences to join me in this endeavor\", Egwene said, drawing their attention away from glares at one another.\\n\\n \"The Lord Dragon’s intentions are . . . troubling\", Darlin said. \"He chose me to lead Tear because I opposed him when I felt it necessary. I believe he will listen to reason if I present it to him\".\\n\\n Gregorin snorted. \"The Lord Dragon do be perfectly reasonable. We do need to offer a good argument, and I do think he will listen\".\\n\\n \"My Keeper has some words for each of you\", Egwene said. \"Please listen to what she has to say. Your cooperation will be remembered\".\\n\\n Silviana rode forward and drew Gregorin aside to speak to him. There wasn’t much of importance to say, but Egwene had feared these two would end up chipping at one another. Silviana’s instruction was to keep them apart.\\n\\n Darlin regarded her with a discerning gaze. He seemed to understand what she was doing, but didn’t complain as he mounted his horse.\\n\\n \"You seem troubled, King Darlin\", she said.\\n\\n \"Some old rivalries run deeper than the ocean’s depths, Mother. I can almost wonder if this meeting was the work of the Dark One, hoping that we would end up destroying one another and doing his work for him\".\\n\\n \"I understand\", Egwene said. \"Perhaps it would be best if you advised your men—again, if you’ve already done so—that there are to be no accidents’ this day\".\\n\\n \"A wise suggestion\". He bowed, pulling back.\\n\\n They were both with her, as was Elayne. Ghealdan would stand for Rand, if what Elayne said about Queen Alliandre was true. Ghealdan wasn’t so powerful that Alliandre worried her—the Borderlanders were another matter. Rand seemed to have won them over.\\n\\n Each of their flags flew over their respective armies, and each ruler was in attendance save Queen Ethenielle, who was in Kandor trying to organize the refugees fleeing her homeland. She had left a sizable contingent for this meeting—including Antol, her eldest son—as if to state that what happened here was as important to Kandor’s survival as fighting on the border.\\n\\n Kandor. The first casualty of the Last Battle. The entire country was said to be aflame. Would Andor be next? The Two Rivers? Steady, Egwene thought.\\n\\n It felt awful to have to consider who was \"for\" whom, but it was her duty to do so. Rand could not direct the Last Battle personally, as he would undoubtedly wish to do. His mission would be to fight the Dark One; he would have neither the presence of mind nor the time to act as a commanding general as well. She intended to come from this meeting with the White Tower acknowledged as leading the collected forces against the Shadow, and she would not give up responsibility for the seals.\\n\\n How much could she trust this man Rand had become? He wasn’t the Rand she’d grown up with. He was more akin to the Rand she’d come to know out in the Aiel Waste, only more confident. And, perhaps, more cunning. He had grown quite proficie \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-50.html","bookId":1601,"book":{"id":1601,"title":"A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14)","description":"Storyline: A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14) \\n “And it came to pass in those days, as it had come before and would come again, that the Dark lay heavy on the land and weighed down the hearts of men, and the green things failed, and hope died.” From Charal Drianaan te Calamon, The Cycle of the Dragon. \\n In the Field of Merrilor the rulers of the nations gather to join behind Rand al’Thor, or to stop him from his plan to break the seals on the Dark One’s prison—which may be a sign of his madness, or the last hope of humankind.
