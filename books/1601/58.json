What is this about?\"\\n\\n \"Well, I just noticed something. The Aiel are like tools\".\\n\\n \"All right . . \"\\n\\n \"And tools that aren’t used grow rusty\", Perrin said.\\n\\n \"Which is why they raid one another\", Rand said, rubbing his temple. \"To keep up their skills. That is why I exempted them. Light, Perrin! I think this is going to be a disaster. If we include them in this document . . \".\\n\\n \"I don’t think you have a choice, now\", Perrin said. \"The others will never sign it if the Aiel are left out\".\\n\\n \"I don’t know if they’ll sign it anyway\", Rand said. He looked longingly at the sheet on the table. \"It was such a beautiful dream, Perrin. A dream of good for humanity. I thought I had them. Right up until Egwene called my bluff, I thought I had them\".\\n\\n It was a good thing others couldn’t smell Rand’s emotions, or everyone there would have known that he’d never refuse to go against the Dark One. Rand showed not a hint of it on his face, but inside, Perrin knew he had been as nervous as a boy at his first shearing.\\n\\n \"Rand, don’t you see?\" Perrin said. \"The solution\".\\n\\n Rand frowned at him.\\n\\n \"The Aiel\", Perrin said. \"The tool that needs to be used. A treaty that needs to be enforced . . \".\\n\\n Rand hesitated, then grinned widely. \"You’re a genius, Perrin\".\\n\\n \"So long as it’s about blacksmithing, I suppose I know a thing or two\".\\n\\n \"But this . . . this isn’t about blacksmithing, Perrin . . \".\\n\\n \"Of course it is\", Perrin said. How could Rand not see that?\\n\\n Rand turned, no doubt ending his weave. He strode up to the document, then held it up toward one of his clerks in the back of the pavilion. \"I want two provisions added. First, this document is void if not signed by either the Seanchan Daughter of the Nine Moons or the Empress. Second . . . the Aiel—all but the Shaido—are to be written into the document as enforcers of the peace and mediators of disputes between nations. Any nation may call upon them if they feel abused, and the Aiel—not enemy armies—will provide redress. They can hunt criminals across national borders. They are to be subject to the laws of the nations in which they reside at the time, but they are not subjects of that nation\".\\n\\n He turned to Elayne. \"There is your enforcement, Elayne, the way to keep your small pressures from building\".\\n\\n \"The Aiel?\" she asked skeptically.\\n\\n \"Will you agree to this, Rhuarc?\" Rand asked. \"Bael, Jheran, the rest of you? You claim to be left without purpose, and Perrin sees you as a tool that needs to be worked. Will you take this charge? To prevent war, to punish those who do wrong, to work with the rulers of nations to see justice served?\"\\n\\n \"Justice as we see it, Rand al’Thor\", Rhuarc said, \"or as they see it?\"\\n\\n \"It will have to be according to the conscience of the Aiel\", Rand said. \"If they call for you, they will have to know that they’ll receive your justice. This will not work if the Aiel simply become pawns. Your autonomy will be what makes this effective\".\\n\\n Gregorin and Darlin began to complain, but Rand silenced them with a look. Perrin nodded to himself, arms folded. Their complaints were weaker now than they had been before. He smelled . . . thoughtfulness from many of them.\\n\\n They see this as an opportunity, he realized. They view the Aiel as savages, and think they’ll be easy to manipulate once Rand is gone. Perrin grinned, imagining their defeat should they attempt that course.\\n\\n \"This is very sudden\", Rhuarc said.\\n\\n \"Welcome to the dinner party\", Elayne added, still staring daggers at Rand \"Try the soup\". Oddly, she smelled proud. Strange woman.\\n\\n \"I warn you, Rhuarc\", Rand said. \"You will need to change your ways. The Aiel will have to act together on these matters; the chiefs and Wise Ones will need to hold council to make decisions together. One clan cannot fight a battle while other clans disagree and fight for the other side.\\n\\n \"We will speak of it\", Rhuarc said, nodding to the other Aiel chiefs.\\n\\n \"This will mean an end to the Aiel\".\\n\\n \"A beginning as well\", Rand said.\\n\\n The Aiel clan chiefs and the Wise Ones gathered separately to one side, and spoke in soft voices. Aviendha lingered, with Rand staring away, troubled. Perrin heard him whisper something, so soft Perrin’s ears barely made it out.\\n\\n \" . . . your dream now . . . when you wake from this life, we will be no more . . \".\\n\\n Rand’s clerks, smelling frantic, came forward to begin working on the document’s additions. The woman Cadsuane watched all events with a stern expression.\\n\\n She smelled extremely proud.\\n\\n \"Add a provision\", Rand said. \"The Aiel can call upon other nations to aid them in their enforcement if they decide that their own numbers will not be enough. Give formal methods by which nations can petition the Aiel for redress or for permission to attack a foe\".\\n\\n The clerks nodded, working harder.\\n\\n \"You act as if this were settled\", Egwene said, eyes on Rand.\\n\\n \"Oh, it is far from that\", Moiraine said. \"Rand, I have some words for you\".\\n\\n \"Are they words I will like? he asked.\\n\\n \"I suspect not. Tell me, why do you need to command the armies yourself? You will be traveling to Shayol Ghul where you will no doubt be unable to contact anyone\".\\n\\n \"Somebody needs to be in command, Moiraine\".\\n\\n \"On this point, I believe all would agree\".\\n\\n Rand folded his arms behind his back, smelling troubled. \"I have taken responsibility for this people, Moiraine. I want to see that they’re cared for, that the brutalities of this battle are minimized\".\\n\\n \"I fear that is a poor reason to lead a battle\", Moiraine said softly. \"You do not fight to preserve your troops; you fight to win. This leader need not be you, Rand. It should not be you\".\\n\\n \"I won’t have this battle turn into a tangle, Moiraine\", he said. \"If you could see the mistakes we made last time, the confusion that can result when everyone thinks they are in control. Battle is turmoil, but we still need an ultimate commander to make decisions, to hold e \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-58.html","bookId":1601,"book":{"id":1601,"title":"A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14)","description":"Storyline: A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14) \\n “And it came to pass in those days, as it had come before and would come again, that the Dark lay heavy on the land and weighed down the hearts of men, and the green things failed, and hope died.” From Charal Drianaan te Calamon, The Cycle of the Dragon. \\n In the Field of Merrilor the rulers of the nations gather to join behind Rand al’Thor, or to stop him from his plan to break the seals on the Dark One’s prison—which may be a sign of his madness, or the last hope of humankind.
