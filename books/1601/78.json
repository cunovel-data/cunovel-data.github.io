I guess that’s what should have happened, with you being the bloody Daughter-Heir. Sorry. The Daughter-Heir. Not bloody at all\". The Shienaran man grimaced.\n \"You can swear all you want, Uno\", Elayne said dryly. \"Nynaeve isn’t around. What are you doing here?\"\n \"The Amyrlin\", he said. \"She flaming wanted a messenger, and I was bloody chosen. Already gave Egwene’s bloody report to your commanders, for all the bloody good it will do. We’ve set up our flaming battle positions and started scouting out Kandor, and the place is a bloody mess. You want details?\"\n Elayne smiled. \"I’ll hear the report from my commanders, Uno\", she said. \"Have a rest, and go have a flaming bath, you son of a shepherd’s boil\".\n Uno blew a mouthful of water out at the comment. Elayne smiled. She’d heard that last curse from a soldier just the day before, and still didn’t know why it was considered to be so vile. It had the proper effect.\n \"I . . . No flaming bath for me\", Uno said. \"Er, Your Majesty. I’ve had my five minutes of rest. The Trollocs could attack soon up in bloody Kandor, and I won’t have the others fighting without me\". He saluted her, hand across chest, and bowed before hurrying back toward the Traveling ground.\n \"Pity\", Birgitte said, \"he was a good drinking companion. I’d have liked him to stay a little while\". Through the bond, Elayne felt a different reaction from her, as she watched Uno’s backside.\n Elayne blushed. \"There’s no time for that right now. Either of those things\".\n \"Just looking\", Birgitte said innocently. \"I suppose we should go listen to the reports from the other battlefields\".\n \"We should\", Elayne said firmly.\n Birgitte didn’t voice her annoyance, but Elayne could feel it. Birgitte hated battle planning, something Elayne found odd in a woman who had fought in thousands of battles, a hero who had saved countless lives during some of the great moments in history.\n They came to the battle pavilion, one of the few full-sized tents the army carried. Inside, she found Bashere conferring with several of the commanders: Abell Cauthon, Gallenne and Trom, second-in-command of the Whitecloaks. Galad himself, like Perrin, was with the harrying forces at Caemlyn. Elayne found Trom surprisingly agreeable—much more so than Galad himself.\n \"Well?\" she asked.\n \"Your Majesty\", Trom said, bowing. He didn’t like the fact that she was Aes Sedai, but he hid it well. The others in the room saluted, though Bashere gave merely a friendly wave, then pointed at their battle maps.\n \"Reports from all fronts are in\", Bashere said. \"Refugees from Kandor are flocking to the Amyrlin and her soldiers, and that includes a fair number of fighting men. House soldiers or merchant guards, for the most part. Lord Ituralde’s forces still await the Lord Dragon before moving on Shayol Ghul\". Bashere knuckled his mustache. \"Once they move into that valley, there won’t be any retreat available\".\n \"And the Borderlander army?\" Elayne asked.\n \"Holding\", Bashere said, pointing to another map, showing Shienar. Elayne wondered, idly, if Uno wished he were fighting with the rest of his people at the Gap. \"Last messenger said they feared being overwhelmed, and were considering a controlled retreat\".\n Elayne frowned. \"Are things so bad there? They were supposed to hold until I could finish the Trollocs in Andor and join them. That was the plan\".\n \"It was\", Bashere agreed.\n \"You’re going to tell me that a plan, in warfare, lasts only until the first sword is drawn\", Elayne said. \"Or maybe until the first arrow falls?\"\n \"First lance is raised\", Bashere said under his breath.\n \"I realize that\", Elayne said, stabbing a finger at the map. \"But I also know that Lord Agelmar is a good enough general to hold a pack of Trollocs, especially with the Borderlander armies there to back him up\".\n \"They are holding for now\", Bashere said. \"But they’re still being mightily pressed\". He held up a hand to her objection. \"I know you’re worried about a retreat, but I counsel that you shouldn’t try to overrule Agelmar. He deserves his reputation as a great captain, and he’s there, while we are far away. He will know what to do\".\n She took a deep breath. \"Yes. You are right. Do see if Egwene can send him any troops. Meanwhile, we need to win our battle here quickly\". Fighting on four fronts was going to drain resources quickly.\n Elayne had not only familiar terrain to fight on, but also the best odds. If the other armies could hold steady while she obliterated the Trollocs in Andor, she could join Lan and Agelmar and turn the Gap from a stalemate into a victory. From there, she could reinforce Egwene and reclaim Kandor.\n Elayne’s army was the linchpin of the entire operation. If she didn’t win in Andor, the other armies would have no eventual reinforcement. Lan and Ituralde would waste away, losing wars of attrition. Egwene might have a chance, depending on what the Shadow hurled her direction. Elayne didn’t want to find out.\n \"We need the Trollocs to charge us\", she said. \"Now\".\n Bashere nodded.\n \"Step up the harrying\", Elayne said. \"Hit them with constant waves of arrows. Make it clear that if they don’t charge, we’re going to wear them down to nothing\".\n \"And if they just retreat back into the city?\" Trom asked. \"The fires are dying down\".\n \"Then, like it or not, we’ll bring those dragons in to start leveling Caemlyn. We cannot wait any longer\".\n Androl struggled to stay awake. The drink they had given him . . . it made him drowsy. What was the purpose of that?\n Something to do with channeling, Androl thought in a daze. The One Power was lost to him, though there was no shield. What kind of drink could do that to a man?\n Poor Emarin lay weeping in his bonds. They had not managed to Turn him yet, but as the hours wore on, he seemed closer and closer to breaking. Androl stretched, twisting his head. He could barely make out the thirteen men Taim had been using for the process. They slumped as they sat around a table in the dim r \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-78.html","bookId":1601,"book":{"id":1601,"title":"A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14)","description":"Storyline: \n A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14) \n “And it came to pass in those days, as it had come before and would come again, that the Dark lay heavy on the land and weighed down the hearts of men, and the green things failed, and hope died.” From Charal Drianaan te Calamon, The Cycle of the Dragon. \n In the Field of Merrilor the rulers of the nations gather to join behind Rand al’Thor, or to stop him from his plan to break the seals on the Dark One’s prison—which may be a sign of his madness, or the last hope of humankind.
