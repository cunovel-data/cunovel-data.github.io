His clothing blended to match the color of the clay bricks, and he stayed low, bow out. It wouldn’t have the range of a longbow, but from here, he’d be deadly.\\n\\n Perrin dropped to the ground, floating softly the last inch or so in order to keep from making noise. He crouched and shifted to the side of a building just ahead. He shifted again, to the edge of the last building in the row before the excavation, then looked over his shoulder. Gaul, hidden quite well up above, raised his fingers. He had tracked Perrin.\\n\\n From here, Perrin crept forward on his belly, not wanting to shift to a place he couldn’t see directly. He reached the lip of the first cavernous foundation hole and looked down on a dirt floor. The wind still blew, and dust swirled down below, obscuring any tracks that might have been left.\\n\\n Perrin rose to a crouch and began to make his way around the perimeter of the large foundation. Where would the exact center of the dome be? He couldn’t tell; it was too large. He kept his eyes open.\\n\\n His attention was so focused on the foundation holes that he nearly walked right into the guards. A quiet chuckle from one of them alerted him, and he shifted immediately, jumping to the other side of the foundation and dropping to his knees, Two Rivers longbow appearing in his hands. He scanned the area he’d left, now distant.\\n\\n Fool, he thought, finally spotting them. The two men lounged in a shack built beside the foundations. The shack was the type of structure you’d expect workers to take meals in. Perrin looked about anxiously, but Slayer did not rise out of hiding to attack him, and the two guards failed to spot him.\\n\\n He couldn’t make out many details, so he cautiously shifted back to near where he’d been. He dropped down into the foundation and created an earthen ledge on its side to stand on while peering over the lip of the hole into the shack.\\n\\n Yes, there were two of them. Men in black coats. Asha’man. He thought he recognized them from the aftermath of Dumai’s Wells, where they had rescued Rand. They were loyal to him, weren’t they? Had Rand sent help for Perrin?\\n\\n Light burn that man, Perrin thought. Couldn’t he just be upfront with everyone for once?\\n\\n Of course, even Asha’man could be Darkfriends. Perrin debated climbing out of the pit and confronting them.\\n\\n \"Broken tools\", Lanfear said idly.\\n\\n Perrin jumped, cursing to find her standing on the ledge beside him, peeking up at the two men.\\n\\n \"They’ve been Turned\", she said. \"I’ve always found that to be a wasteful business. You lose something in the transformation—they will never serve as well as if they’d come willingly. Oh, they’ll be loyal, but the light is gone. The self-motivation, the spark of ingenuity that makes people into people\".\\n\\n \"Be quiet\", Perrin said. \"Turned? What do you mean? Is that . . \".\\n\\n \"Thirteen Myrddraal and thirteen Dreadlords\". Lanfear sneered. \"Such crudeness. Such a waste\".\\n\\n \"I don’t understand\".\\n\\n Lanfear sighed, speaking as if she were explaining to a child. \"Those who can channel can be Turned to the Shadow by force in the right circumstances. M’Hael has been having trouble here making the process work as easily as he should. He needs women if he’s going to Turn men easily.\\n\\n Light, Perrin thought. Did Rand know this could happen to people? Were they planning to do the same thing to him?\\n\\n \"I’d be careful around those two\", Lanfear said. \"They’re powerful\".\\n\\n \"Then you should be speaking more softly\", Perrin whispered.\\n\\n \"Bah. It’s easy to bend sound in this place. I could shout for all I\u0027m worth, and they wouldn’t hear. They’re drinking, you see? They brought the wine through with them. They’re here in the flesh, of course. I doubt their leader warned them of the dangers of that\".\\n\\n Perrin looked up at the guards. The two men sipped at their wine, chuckling to one another. As Perrin watched, the first slumped to the side, then the other did as well. They slipped out of their seats and hit the ground.\\n\\n \"What did you do?\"\\n\\n \"Forkroot in the wine\", Lanfear said.\\n\\n \"Why are you helping me?\" Perrin demanded.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m fond of you, Perrin\".\\n\\n \"You’re one of the Forsaken!\"\\n\\n \"I was\", Lanfear said. \"That . . . privilege has been removed from me. The Dark One discovered I was planning to help Lews Therin win. Now, I—\" She froze, looking toward the sky again. What did she see in those clouds? Something that made her grow pale. She vanished a moment later.\\n\\n Perrin tried to decide what to do. He couldn’t trust her, of course. However, she was good with the wolf dream. She managed to appear next to him without making any sound at all. That was tougher than it seemed; she had to still the air as it was moved out of the way when she arrived. She had to land just precisely so that she didn’t make noise, and had to mute her clothing’s rustle.\\n\\n With a start, Perrin realized that this time she’d also been masking her scent. He’d only been able to smell her—her scent was that of soft night lily—after she’d begun speaking to him.\\n\\n Uncertainly, he crawled out of the pit and approached the shack. Both men were asleep. What happened to men who slept in the dream? Normally, this would have sent them back to the waking world—but they were here in the flesh.\\n\\n He shivered, thinking of what had been done to them. \"Turned\"? Was that the word she’d used? Light. It seemed unfair. Not that the Pattern is ever fair, Perrin acknowledged, quickly searching through the hut.\\n\\n He found the dreamspike driven into the ground under the table. The silvery piece of metal looked like a long tent spike, carved with designs down its length. It was similar to the other one he’d seen, but not exactly the same. He pulled it free, then waited, hand on his hammer, expecting Slayer to come for him.\\n\\n \"He’s not here\", Lanfear said.\\n\\n \"Light!\" Perrin jumped, hammer raised. He turned. \"Why do you keep appearing like that, woman?\"\\n\\n \"He searches for me\", she said, glancing skyward. \"I’m not supposed to be able to do this, and he’s grown suspicious. If he finds me, he’ll know for certain, and I will be destroyed, captured and burned for an eternity\".\\n\\n \"You expect me to feel sorry for you, one of the Forsaken?\u0026qu \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-99.html","bookId":1601,"book":{"id":1601,"title":"A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14)","description":"Storyline: A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14) \\n “And it came to pass in those days, as it had come before and would come again, that the Dark lay heavy on the land and weighed down the hearts of men, and the green things failed, and hope died.” From Charal Drianaan te Calamon, The Cycle of the Dragon. \\n In the Field of Merrilor the rulers of the nations gather to join behind Rand al’Thor, or to stop him from his plan to break the seals on the Dark One’s prison—which may be a sign of his madness, or the last hope of humankind.
