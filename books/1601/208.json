Mat had placed it as far from the Seanchan as was reasonable. \"The marriage is going to present a problem. I suggest that you—\" \"Wait, Egwene\", Mat said. \"What are you talking about?\" \"You are running from the Seanchan guards\", Egwene said. \"Weren’t you listening . . . Of course you weren’t. It is pleasant to know that, as the world crumbles, a few things are completely unchangeable. Cuendillar and Mat Cauthon\". \"I’m running from them\", Mat said, looking over his shoulder, \"because Tuon wants me to sit in judgment. Any time a soldier is seeking the Empress’s mercy for a crime, I’m the one who is supposed to bloody hear his case!\" \"You\", Egwene said, \"passing judgment?\" \"I know\", Mat said. \"Too much bloody work, if you ask me. I’ve been dodging guardsmen all day, trying to steal a little time for myself\". \"A little honest work wouldn’t kill you, Mat\". \"Now, you know that’s not true. Soldiering is honest work, and it gets men killed all the bloody time\". Gawyn Trakand was apparently practicing to be an Aes Sedai sometime, because he kept giving Mat glares that would have made Moiraine proud. Well, let him. Gawyn was a prince. He had been raised to do things like pass judgment. He probably sent a few men to the gallows each day at his lunch break, just to keep in practice. But Mat . . . Mat was not going to order men to be executed, and that was that. They passed a group of Aiel sparring together. Was this group what Urien had been running to reach? Once they had passed—Mat trying to make the others walk faster so the Seanchan would not catch up—he drew closer to Egwene. \"Have you found it yet?\" he asked softly. \"No\", Egwene said, eyes forward. No need to mention what it was. \"How could you have lost the thing? After all the work we bloody went through to find it?\" \"We? From the telling I hear, Rand, Loial and the Borderlanders had far more to do with finding it than you\". \"I was there\", Mat said. \"I rode across the entire bloody continent, didn’t I? Burn me, first Rand, then you. Is everybody going to chivvy me about those days? Gawyn, you want a turn?\" \"Yes, please\". He sounded eager. \"Shut up\", Mat said. \"It seems that nobody can remember straight but me. I hunted down that bloody Horn like a madman. And, I’ll mention, it was me blowing the thing that let you all escape Falme\". \"Is that how you remember it?\" Egwene asked. \"Sure\", Mat said. \"I mean, I have some holes in there, but I’ve pieced it mostly together\". \"And the dagger?\" \"That trinket? Hardly worth anyone’s time\". He caught himself reaching to his side, to where he had once carried it. Egwene raised an eyebrow at him. \"Anyway, thats not the point. We\u0027re going to need that bloody instrument, Egwene. We’ll need it\". \"We have people searching\", she said. \"We’re not sure exactly what happened. There was a Traveling residue, but it’s been a while and . . . Light, Mat. We’re trying. I promise it. It’s not the only thing the Shadow has stolen from us recently . . \". He glanced at her, but she gave him no more. Flaming Aes Sedai. \"Has anyone seen Perrin yet?\" he asked. \"I don’t want to be the one to tell him his wife has gone missing\". \"Nobody has seen him\", Egwene said. \"I assume he is at work helping Rand\". \"Bah\", Mat said. \"Can you make a gateway for me up to the top of the Knob?\" \"I thought you wanted to go to my camp\". Its on the way, Mat said. Well, sort of, it was. \"And those Deathwatch Guards won’t expect it. Burn me, Egwene, but I think they’ve guessed where we were heading\". Egwene after pausing for a moment—opened them a gateway to the Traveling ground atop the Knob. They stepped through onto it. More than a hill, less than a mountain, Dashar Knob rose a good hundred feet into the air near the middle of the battlefield. The rock formation was unscalable, and gateways were the only way to reach the top. From here, Mat and his commanders would be able to watch the entire battle play out. \"I have never known anyone else\", Egwene said to him, \"who will work so hard to avoid hard work, Matrim Cauthon\". \"You haven’t spent enough time around soldiers\". Mat waved at the men who saluted him as he walked out of the Traveling grounds. He looked north toward the River Mora and across it into Arafel. Then northeast, toward the ruins of what had once been some kind of fort or watchtower. Eastward, toward the rising palisade and the forest. He continued to turn, southward to gaze at the River Erinin in the far distance, and the strange little grove of tall trees that Loial was so in awe of. They said Rand had grown those, during the meeting where the treaty had been signed. Mat looked southwest toward the only good ford on the Mora nearby, named Hawal Ford by the locals who had farmed this area; beyond the ford on the Arafel side was a large expanse of bogs. Westward, across the Mora, lay Polov Heights—a forty-foot-tall plateau with a steep slope on the east and more gradual slopes on the other sides. Between the base of the southwestern slope and the bogs was a corridor roughly two hundred paces across, well worn by travelers who used the ford to cross between Arafel and Shienar. Mat could use these features to his advantage. He could use them all. Would that be enough? He could feel something pulling on him, tugging him northward. Rand would need him soon. He turned, ready to bolt, as someone approached across the top of the Knob, but it was not the Deathwatch Guards. It was just leather-faced Jur Grady. \"I fetched those soldiers for you\", Grady said, pointing. Mat could see a small force coming through a gateway to the Traveling grounds near the palisade. A hundred men of the Band, led by Delarn, flying a bloody red flag. The Redarms were accompanied by some five hundred people in worn clothing. \"What was the point of this?\" Grady asked. \"You sent those hundred to a village in the south to recruit, I assume?\" That, and more. I saved your life, man, Mat thought, trying to pick Delarn out of the group. And then you volunteer for this. Bloody fool.
