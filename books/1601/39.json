That was unexpected.\n \"You should understand already\", she said. \"If you’d paid attention to what I told you about us . . \".\n \"Unfortunately, you had a complete woolhead of a student\".\n \"It is fortunate for him that I have decided to extend my training\". She took a step closer. \"There are many things I still need to teach\". Her blush deepened.\n Light. She was beautiful. But so was Elayne . . . and so was Min . . . and . . .\n He was a fool. A Light-blinded fool.\n ‘Aviendha\", he said. \"I love you, I truly do. But that’s a problem, burn it! I love all three of you. I don’t think I could accept this and choose—\" Suddenly, she was laughing. \"You are a fool, aren’t you, Rand al’Thor?\n Often. But what—\"\n \"We are first-sisters, Rand al’Thor, Elayne and I. When we get to know her better, Min will join us. We three will share in all things\".\n First-sisters? He should have suspected, following that odd bonding. He raised a hand to his head. We will share you, they had said to him.\n Leaving four bonded women to their pains was bad enough, but three bonded women who loved him? Light, he did not want to bring them pain!\n \"They say you have changed\", Aviendha said. \"So many have spoken of it in the short time since my return that almost, I grow weary of hearing about you. Well, your face may be calm, but your emotions are not. Is this so terrible a thing to consider, being with the three of us?\"\n \"I want it, Aviendha. I should hide myself because I do. But the pain . . .\n You have embraced it, have you not?\"\n \"It is not my pain I fear. It is yours\".\n \"Are we so weak, then, that we cannot bear what you can?\"\n That look in her eyes was unnerving.\n \"Of course not\", Rand said. \"But how can I hope for pain in those I love?\n The pain is ours to accept\", she said, raising her chin. \"Rand al’Thor, your decision is simple, though you strive to make it difficult. Choose yes or no. Be warned; it is all three of us, or none of us. We will not let you come between us\".\n He hesitated, then—feeling a complete lecher—he kissed her. Behind him, Maidens he hadn’t realized were watching began to yell louder insults, though he could now hear an incongruous joy to them. He pulled back from the kiss, then reached out, cupping the side of Aviendha’s face with his hand. \"You’re bloody fools. All three of you\".\n \"Then it is well. We are your equals. You should know that I am a Wise One now\".\n \"Then perhaps we are not equals\", Rand said, \"for I’ve only just begun to understand how little wisdom I possess\".\n Aviendha sniffed. \"Enough talk. You will bed me now\".\n \"Light!\" he said. \"A little forward, aren’t you? Is that the Aiel way of doing things?\"\n \"No\", she said, blushing again. \"I just . . . I am not very skilled with this\".\n \"You three decided this, didn’t you? Which of you came to me?\"\n She hesitated, then nodded.\n \"I’m never going to get to choose, am I?\"\n She shook her head.\n He laughed and pulled her close. She was stiff, initially, but then melted against him. \"So, do I go fight them first?\" He nodded toward the Maidens.\n \"That is only for the wedding, if we decide you are worth marriage, fool man. And it would be our families, not members of our society. You really did ignore your lessons, didn’t you?\"\n He looked down at her. \"Well, I’m glad there’s no fighting to do. I’m not sure how much time we have, and I was hoping to get some sleep tonight. Still . . \". He trailed off at the look in her eyes. \"I’m . . . not getting any sleep, am I?\"\n She shook her head.\n \"Ah, well. At least I don’t have to worry about you freezing to death this time\".\n \"Yes. But it may happen that I die of boredom, Rand al’Thor, if you do not stop rambling\".\n She took him by the arm and gently, but firmly, pulled him back into his tent—the calls of the Maidens growing louder, more insulting and more exuberant all at the same time.\n \"I suspect the reason is some kind of ter’angreal\", Pevara said. She crouched with Androl in the back room of one of the Black Tower’s general storehouses, and she did not find the position terribly comfortable. The room smelled of dust, grain and wood. Most buildings in the Black Tower were new, and this was no exception, the cedar boards still fresh.\n \"You know of a ter’angreal that could prevent gateways?\" Androl asked. \"Not specifically, no\", Pevara replied, shifting to a better position. \"But it is generally accepted that what we know of ter’angreal comprises only the smallest portion of what was once known. There must be thousands of different types of ter’angreal, and if Taim is a Darkfriend, he has access to the Forsaken—who could likely explain to him the use and construction of things we can only dream about\".\n \"So we need to find this ter’angreal\", Androl said. \"Block it, or at least figure out how it functions\".\n \"And escape?\" Pevara asked. \"Haven’t you already determined that leaving would be a poor choice?\"\n \"Well . . . yes\", Androl admitted.\n She concentrated, and could catch glimmers of what he was thinking. She’d heard that the Warder bond allowed an empathic connection. This seemed deeper. He was . . . yes, he really wished he could make gateways. He felt disarmed without them.\n \"It’s my Talent\", he said begrudgingly. He knew she’d sift out the reason eventually. \"I can make gateways. At least, I could\".\n \"Really? With your level of strength in the One Power?\"\n \"Or lack of it?\" he asked. She could sense a little of what he was thinking. Though he accepted his weakness, he worried that it made him unfit to lead. A curious mix of self-confidence and self-consciousness.\n \"Yes\", he continued. \"Traveling requires great strength in the One Power, but I can make large gateways. Before this all went wrong, the largest I ever made was a gateway thirty feet across\".\n Pevara blinked. \"Surely you\u0026rsq \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-39.html","bookId":1601,"book":{"id":1601,"title":"A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14)","description":"Storyline: \n A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14) \n “And it came to pass in those days, as it had come before and would come again, that the Dark lay heavy on the land and weighed down the hearts of men, and the green things failed, and hope died.” From Charal Drianaan te Calamon, The Cycle of the Dragon. \n In the Field of Merrilor the rulers of the nations gather to join behind Rand al’Thor, or to stop him from his plan to break the seals on the Dark One’s prison—which may be a sign of his madness, or the last hope of humankind.
