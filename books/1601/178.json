He had a moment to decide. Follow?\n No. He had to keep watch on Slayer. However, being this close, he felt something . . . an awareness. Stepping through that gateway would be like . . .\n Like waking up.\n The gateway snapped shut. Perrin felt a stab of regret, but knew staying in the wolf dream had been right. Rand was all but defenseless against Slayer here; he would need Perrin\u0027s help.\n \"We need to send warning\", Perrin said.\n I suppose I could take the message for you, Young Bull, sent the unnamed wolf.\n Perrin froze, then spun, pointing. \"Elyas!\"\n I am Long Tooth here, Young Bull. Elyas sent amusement.\n \"I thought you said you didn’t come here\".\n I said I avoided it. This place is strange and dangerous. I have enough strangeness and danger in my life in the other world. The wolf sat down on his haunches. But someone needed to check on you, foolish pup.\n Perrin smiled. Elyas’ thoughts were a strange mix of wolf and human. His way of sending was very wolflike, but the way he thought of himself was too individual, too human.\n \"How goes the fight?\" Perrin asked eagerly. Gaul took up position nearby, watching, alert, in case Graendal or Slayer appeared. The field before them, the floor of the valley, was quiet for once. The winds had died down, the dust on the sandy ground stirring in small rifts and ripples. Like water.\n I do not know of the other battlefields, Elyas sent, and we wolves stay far from the two-legs. We fight, here and there, at the edges of the battle. Mostly, we have attacked the Twisted Ones and Neverborn from the other side of the canyon, where there are no two-legs except those strange Aiel.\n It is a grueling fight. Shadowkiller must do quick work. We have stood five days, but may not last many more.\n Five days here in the north. Much longer had passed in the rest of the world since Rand entered to face the Dark One. Rand himself was so close to the Bore that it was likely only hours—maybe minutes—had passed for him. Perrin could feel how time moved differently when he drew near to where Rand fought.\n \"Ituralde\", Perrin said, scratching at his beard. \"He’s one of the great captains\".\n Yes, Elyas sent, smelling of amusement. Some call him \"Little Wolf\". \"Bashere is with Elayne’s army\", Perrin said. \"And Gareth Bryne is with Egwene. Agelmar is with the Borderlanders and Lan\".\n I do not know.\n \"He is. Four battlefronts. Four great captains. That’s what she’s doing.\n \"Graendal?\" Gaul asked.\n \"Yes\", Perrin said, anger gathering. \"She’s doing something to them, changing their minds, corrupting them. I overheard her saying . . . Yes. That’s it, I’m certain. Instead of fighting our armies with armies of her own, she plans to bring down the great captains. Elyas, do you know how a man can shift in and out of the wolf dream in the flesh?\"\n Even if I knew this thing—which I do not—I would not teach it to you, Elyas said with a growl. Has nobody told you it is a terrible, dangerous thing that you do?\n \"Too many\", Perrin said. \"Light! We need to warn Bashere. I must—\"\n \"Perrin Aybara!\" Gaul said, pointing. \"He is here!\"\n Perrin spun to see a dark blur streak upward toward the entrance to the Pit of Doom. Wolves whimpered and died. Others howled, beginning the hunt. This time, Slayer did not back away.\n The way of the predator. Two or three quick lunges to determine weakness, then an all-out attack.\n \"Wake!\" Perrin called to Elyas, running up the incline. \"Warn Elayne, Egwene, anyone you can! And if you cannot, stop Ituralde somehow. The great captains are being corrupted. One of the Forsaken controls their minds, and their tactics cannot be trusted!\"\n I will do it, Young Bull, Elyas sent, fading.\n \"Go to Rand, Gaul!\" Perrin roared. \"Guard the way to him! Do not let any of those red-veils pass you!\"\n Perrin summoned his hammer to his hands, not waiting for a reply, then shifted to confront Slayer.\n Rand clashed with Moridin, sword against sword, standing before the darkness that was the essence of the Dark One. The cold expanse was somehow both infinite and empty.\n Rand held so much of the One Power that he nearly burst. He would need that strength in the fight to come. For now, he resisted Moridin sword against sword. He wielded Callandor as a physical weapon, fighting as if with a sword made of light itself, parrying Moridin\u0027s attacks.\n Each step Rand took dripped blood to the ground. Nynaeve and Moiraine clung to stalagmites as if something were battering them, a wind that Rand could not sense. Nynaeve closed her eyes. Moiraine stared straight ahead as if determined not to look away, no matter the price.\n Rand turned aside Moridin’s latest attack, the blades throwing sparks. He had always been the better swordsman of the two, during the Age of Legends.\n He had lost his hand, but thanks to Tam, that no longer mattered as it once might have. And he was also wounded. This place . . . this place changed things. Rocks on the ground seemed to move, and he often stumbled. The air grew alternately musty and dry, then humid and moldy. Time slipped around them like a stream. Rand felt as if he could see it. Each blow here took moments, yet hours passed outside.\n He scored Moridin across the arm, drawing his blood to spray against the wall.\n \"My blood and yours\", Rand said. \"I have you to thank for this wound in my side, Elan. You thought you were the Dark One, didn’t you? Has he punished you for that?\"\n \"Yes\", Moridin snarled. \"He returned me to life\". Moridin came swinging hard in a two-handed blow. Rand stepped backward, catching the blow on Callandor; but he misjudged the slope of the ground. Either that, or the slope changed on him. Rand stumbled, the blow forcing him down on one knee.\n Blade against blade. Rand’s leg slipped backward, and brushed the darkness behind, which waited like a pool of ink.\n All went black.\n The distant Ogier song was comforting to Elayne as she slumped in her saddle atop the hill just north of Cairhien.\n The women around her weren’t in any better shape than she was. Elayne had gathered all of the Kinswomen who could hold on to saidar—no matter how weak or tired—and formed two circles with them. She had twelve with her in her own circle, but their collective strength in the Power at the moment was barely more than th \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-178.html","bookId":1601,"book":{"id":1601,"title":"A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14)","description":"Storyline: \n A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14) \n “And it came to pass in those days, as it had come before and would come again, that the Dark lay heavy on the land and weighed down the hearts of men, and the green things failed, and hope died.” From Charal Drianaan te Calamon, The Cycle of the Dragon. \n In the Field of Merrilor the rulers of the nations gather to join behind Rand al’Thor, or to stop him from his plan to break the seals on the Dark One’s prison—which may be a sign of his madness, or the last hope of humankind.
