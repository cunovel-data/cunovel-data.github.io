Don’t I look it?\" \"I just thought I could pick out any accent\", he said, pulling a pair of stitches tight. \"I’ve been there. Maybe I do know your uncle\". \"He’s dead\", she said. \"Murdered by Darkfriends\". Androl fell silent. \"I’m sorry\". \"It’s been over a hundred years now. I miss my family, but they’d be dead by now even if the Darkfriends hadn’t killed them. Everyone I knew back home is dead\". \"My sorrow is deeper, then. Truly\". \"It is long past\", Pevara said. \"I can remember them with fondness without having the pain intrude. But what of your family? Siblings? Nieces, nephews?\" \"A smattering of each group\", Androl said. \"Do you ever see them?\" He eyed her. \"You’re trying to engage me in friendly conversation to prove that you don’t feel awkward around me. But I’ve seen how you Aes Sedai look at people like me\". \"I—\" \"Say you don’t find us repulsive\". \"I hardly think what you do should be—\" \"Straight answer, Pevara\". \"Very well, fine. Men who can channel do discomfort me. You make me itch all over, and it has only grown worse the longer I’ve been here, surrounded by you\". Androl nodded in satisfaction at having pulled it from her. \"However\", Pevara continued, \"I feel this way because it has been ingrained in me over decades of life. What you do is terribly unnatural, but you yourself do not disgust me. You are just a man trying to do your best, and I hardly think that is worthy of disgust. Either way, I am willing to look beyond my inhibitions in the name of common good\". \"That’s better than I could have expected, I suppose\". He looked back toward the rain-splattered windows. \"The taint is cleansed. This isn’t unnatural any longer. I wish . . . I wish I could just show you, woman\". He looked toward her sharply. \"How does one form one of those circles you mentioned?\" \"Well\", Pevara said, \"I’ve never actually done it with a male channeler, of course. I did some reading before coming down here, but much of what we have is hearsay. So much has been lost. To start with, you must put yourself on the edge of embracing the Source, then open yourself to me. That is how we establish the link\". \"All right\", he said. \"You’re not holding the Source, however\". It was downright unfair, that a man could tell when a woman was holding the One Power and when she wasn’t. Pevara embraced the Source, flooding herself with the sweet nectar that was saidar. She reached out to link with Androl as she would with a woman. That was how one was supposed to begin, according to the records. But it was not the same. Saidin was a torrent, and what she had read was true; she could do nothing with the flows. \"It’s working; my power is flowing into you\". \"Yes\", Pevara said. \"But when a man and woman link, the man must be in control. You must take the lead\". \"How?\" Androl asked. \"I don’t know. I’ll try to pass it. You must control the flows\". He eyed her, and she prepared herself to pass control to him. Instead, he somehow seized it. She was caught in the tempestuous link, yanked—as if by her hair—right in. The force of it nearly made her teeth rattle, and it felt as if her skin was being pulled off. Pevara closed her eyes, breathed deeply, and did not let herself fight back. She had wanted to try this; it could be useful. But she couldn’t help a moment of sheer panic. She was linked with a male channeler,; one of the most feared things the land had ever known. Now he had control of her, completely. Her Power flowed through her, washing over him, and Androl gasped. \"So much . . \". he said. \"Light, you’re strong\". She allowed herself a smile. The link brought with it a storm of awareness. She could feel Androl’s emotions. He was as fearful as she was. He was also solid. She’d imagined that being linked to him would be terrible, because of his madness, but she sensed none of it. But saidin . . . that liquid fire that he wrestled with, like a serpent that was trying to consume him. She pulled back. Was it tainted? She wasn’t certain she could tell. Saidin was so different, so alien. Reports from the early days fragmented, spoke of the taint like an oil slick upon a river. Well, she could see a river—more a stream, really. It appeared that Androl had been honest with her, and wasn’t very powerful. She could not sense any taint—but then again, she did not know what to look for. \"I wonder . \". Androl said. \"I wonder if I can make a gateway with this power\". \"Gateways don’t work in the Black Tower anymore\". \"I know\", he said. \"But I keep feeling that they’re just beyond my fingertips\". Pevara opened her eyes, looking at him. She could feel his honesty within the circle, but creating a gateway required a lot of the One Power, at least for a woman. Androl would have to be orders of magnitude too weak for that weave. Could it require a different level of strength for a man? He reached out a hand, using her Power somehow, mixed with his own. She could feel him pulling the One Power through her. Pevara tried to maintain her composure, but she did not like him having control. She could do nothing! \"Androl\", she said. \"Release me\". \"It’s wonderful . . \". he whispered, eyes unfocused as he stood up. \"Is this what it feels like, to be one of the others? Those with strength in the Power?\" He drew more of her power and used it. Objects in the room began to rise into the air. \"Androl!\" Panic. It was the panic she’d felt after hearing that her parents were dead. She hadn’t known this sense of horror in over a hundred years, not since taking the test for her shawl. He had control of her channeling. Absolute control. She began to gasp, trying to reach for him. She could not use saidar without him releasing it back to her—but he could use it against her. Images of him using her own strength to tie her in Air ran through her mind. She could not end the link. Only he could. He noticed, suddenly, and his eyes widened. The circle vanished like a wink of the eye, and her power was her own again. Without thinking, she lashed out. This would not happen again. She would have the control. The weaves sprang from her before she","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-32.html","bookId":1601,"book":{"id":1601,"title":"A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14)","description":"Storyline: A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14) “And it came to pass in those days, as it had come before and would come again, that the Dark lay heavy on the land and weighed down the hearts of men, and the green things failed, and hope died.” From Charal Drianaan te Calamon, The Cycle of the Dragon.
