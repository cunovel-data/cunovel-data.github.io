You always do this\".\\n\\n \"I do?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. In Rhuidean and the Waste, in the Stone of Tear . . . back in the Two Rivers. You do realize that I went south, instead of coming to your little party with Egwene in Merrilor, to escape?\"\\n\\n \"You think you could stay away from me?\" Rand asked, smiling. \"You really think it would let you?\"\\n\\n \"I could bloody try. No offense, Rand, but you’re going to go mad and all. I figured I’d give you one less friend nearby to kill. You know, save you some trouble. What did you do to your hand, by the way?\"\\n\\n \"What did you do to your eye?\"\\n\\n \"A little accident with a corkscrew and thirteen angry innkeepers. The hand?\"\\n\\n \"Lost it capturing one of the Forsaken\".\\n\\n \"Capturing?\" Mat said. \"You’re growing soft\".\\n\\n Rand snorted. \"Tell me you’ve done better\".\\n\\n \"I killed a gholam\", Mat said.\\n\\n \"I freed Illian from Sammael\".\\n\\n \"I married the Empress of the Seanchan\".\\n\\n \"Mat\", Rand said, \"are you really trying to get into a bragging contest with the Dragon Reborn?\" He paused for a moment. \"Besides, I cleansed saidin. I win\".\\n\\n \"Ah, that’s not really worth much\", Mat said.\\n\\n \"Not worth much? It’s the single most important event to happen since the Breaking\".\\n\\n \"Bah. You and your Asha’man are already crazy\", Mat said, \"so what does it matter?\" He glanced to the side. \"You look nice, by the way. You’ve been taking better care of yourself lately\".\\n\\n \"So you do care\", Rand said.\\n\\n \"Of course I do\", Mat grumbled, looking back at Tuon. \"I mean, you have to keep yourself alive, right? Go have your little duel with the Dark One and keep us all safe? It’s good to know you’re looking up to it\".\\n\\n \"That’s nice to hear\", Rand said, smiling. \"No wisecracks about my nice coat?\"\\n\\n \"What? Wisecracks? You aren’t still sore because I teased you a little a couple of years ago?\"\\n\\n \"Teased?\" Rand said. \"You spent weeks refusing to talk to me\".\\n\\n \"Here now\", Mat said. \"It wasn’t all that bad. I remember that part easily\".\\n\\n Rand shook his head, as if bemused. Bloody ungrateful was what he was. Mat had gone off to fetch Elayne, as Rand had asked, and this was the thanks he was given. Sure, Mat had been a little sidetracked after that. He had still done it, had he not?\\n\\n \"All right\", Mat said very softly, tugging at the bonds of Air holding him. \"I’ll get us out of this, Rand. I’m married to her. Let me do the talking, and—\"\\n\\n \"Daughter of Artur Hawkwing\", Rand said to Tuon. \"Time spins toward the end of all things. The Last Battle has begun, and the threads are being woven. Soon, my final trial will begin\".\\n\\n Tuon stepped forward, Selucia waving a few last finger-talk words toward her. \"You will be taken to Seanchan, Dragon Reborn\", Tuon said. Her voice was collected, firm.\\n\\n Mat smiled. Light, but she made a good Empress. There was no need to filch my medallion, though, he thought. They were going to have words about that. Assuming he survived this. She would not really execute him, would she?\\n\\n Again, he tried the invisible bonds tying him.\\n\\n \"Is that so?\" Rand asked.\\n\\n \"You have delivered yourself to me\", Tuon said. \"It is an omen\". She seemed almost regretful. \"You did not truly think that I would allow you to stroll away, did you? I must take you in chains as a ruler who resisted me—as I have done to the others I found here. You pay the price of your ancestors’ forgetfulness. You should have remembered your oaths\".\\n\\n \"I see\", Rand said.\\n\\n You know, Mat thought, he does a fair job of sounding like a king, too. Light, what kind of people had Mat surrounded himself with? What had happened to the fair barmaids and carousing soldiers?\\n\\n \"Tell me something, Empress\", Rand said. \"What would you all have done if you’d returned to these shores and found Artur Hawkwing’s armies still ruling? What if we hadn’t forgotten our oaths, what if we had stayed true? What then?\"\\n\\n \"We would have welcomed you as brothers\", Tuon said.\\n\\n \"Oh?\" Rand said. \"And you would have bowed to the throne here? Hawkwing’s throne? If his empire still stood, it would have been ruled over by his heir. Would you have tried to dominate them? Would you instead have accepted their rule over you?\"\\n\\n \"That is not the case\", Tuon said, but she seemed to find his words intriguing.\\n\\n \"No, it is not\", Rand said.\\n\\n \"By your argument, you must submit to us\". She smiled.\\n\\n \"I did not make that argument\", Rand said, \"but let us do so. How do you claim the right to these lands?\"\\n\\n \"By being the only legitimate heir of Artur Hawkwing\".\\n\\n \"And why should that matter?\"\\n\\n \"This is his empire. He is the only one to have unified it, he is the only leader to have ruled it in glory and greatness\".\\n\\n \"And there you are wrong\", Rand said, voice growing soft. \"You accept me as the Dragon Reborn?\"\\n\\n \"You must be\", Tuon said slowly, as if wary of a trap.\\n\\n \"Then you accept me for who I am\", Rand said, voice growing loud, crisp. Like a battle horn. \"I am Lews Therin Telamon, the Dragon. I ruled these lands, unified, during the Age of Legends. I was leader of all the armies of the Light, I wore the Ring of Tamyrlin. I stood first among the Servants, highest of the Aes Sedai, and I could summon the Nine Rods of Dominion\".\\n\\n Rand stepped forward. \"I held the loyalty and fealty of all seventeen Generals of Dawn’s Gate. Fortuona Athaem Devi Paendrag, my authority supersedes your own!\"\\n\\n \"Artur Hawkwing—\"\\n\\n \"My authority supersedes that of Hawkwing! If you claim rule by the name of he who conquered, then you must bow before my prior claim. I conquered before Hawkwing, though I needed no sword to do so. You are here on my land, Empress, at my sufferance!\"\\n\\n Thunder broke in the distance. Mat found himself shaking. Light, it was just Rand. Just Rand . . . was it not?\\n\\n Tuon backed away, eyes wide, her lips parted. Her face was full of horror, as if she had just seen \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-114.html","bookId":1601,"book":{"id":1601,"title":"A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14)","description":"Storyline: A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14) \\n “And it came to pass in those days, as it had come before and would come again, that the Dark lay heavy on the land and weighed down the hearts of men, and the green things failed, and hope died.” From Charal Drianaan te Calamon, The Cycle of the Dragon. \\n In the Field of Merrilor the rulers of the nations gather to join behind Rand al’Thor, or to stop him from his plan to break the seals on the Dark One’s prison—which may be a sign of his madness, or the last hope of humankind.
