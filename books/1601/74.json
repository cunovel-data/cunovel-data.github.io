She had to smother the serpent deep inside of her that writhed whenever she thought of them. \"I will not risk the Yellows being attacked while alone and exhausted from Healing. The White Tower is exposed, and is a focus for the enemy—if not the Seanchan, then the Shadow\". \"A valid point\". Silviana sounded reluctant. \"But where else? Caemlyn has fallen, and the Borderlands are too exposed. Tear?\" \"Hardly\", Egwene said. That was Rand’s territory, and it seemed too obvious. \"Send back to Elayne with a suggestion. Perhaps the First of Mayene will be willing to provide a suitable building, a very large one\". Egwene tapped the side of her saddle. \"Send the Accepted and the novices with the Yellows. I don’t want those women on the battlefield, but their strength can be put to use in Healing\". Linked to a Yellow, the weakest of novices could lend a trickle of strength and save lives. Many would be disappointed; they imagined slaying Trollocs. Well, this would be a way for them to fight without getting underfoot, untrained in combat as they were. Egwene glanced over her shoulder. Movement through the gateways would not be finished any time soon. \"Silviana, relay my words to Elayne Sedai\", Egwene said. \"Gawyn, I have something I want to do\". They found Chubain supervising the setup of a command camp in a valley west of the river that formed the boundary between Kandor and Arafel. They’d press forward into this hilly country to meet the oncoming Trollocs, deploying harrying forces in the adjoining valleys, with archers atop the hills alongside defensive units. The plan would be to strike hard at Trollocs as they tried to take the hills, doing as much damage as possible. The harrying units could swipe at enemy flanks while the defenders held the hills as long as they could. The odds were good that they would eventually be pushed out of those hills and across the border into Arafel, but on the wide plains of Arafel their cavalries could be used to better advantage. Egwene’s force, like Lan’s, was meant to delay and slow the Trollocs until Elayne could defeat those in the south. Ideally they would hold until reinforcements could arrive. Chubain saluted and led them to a tent that had already been erected nearby. Egwene dismounted and started to enter, but Gawyn laid a hand on her arm. She sighed, nodded and let him enter first. Inside, on the floor with legs folded, sat the Seanchan woman that Nynaeve had called Egeanin, although the woman insisted on being called Leilwin. Three members of the Tower Guard watched over her and her Illianer husband. Leilwin looked up as Egwene entered, then immediately rose to her knees and performed a graceful bow, forehead touching the tent floor. Her husband did as she did, though his motions seemed more reluctant. Perhaps he was merely a worse actor than she was. \"Out\", Egwene said to the three guards. They did not argue, though their withdrawal was slow. As if she couldn’t handle herself with her Warder against two people who could not channel. Men. Gawyn took up position at the side of the tent, leaving her to address the two prisoners. \"Nynaeve tells me you are marginally trustworthy\", Egwene said to Leilwin. \"Oh, sit up. Nobody bows that low in the White Tower, not even the lowest of servants\". Leilwin sat up, but kept her eyes lowered. \"I have failed greatly in the duty assigned me, and in so doing have endangered the Pattern itself\". \"Yes\", Egwene said. \"The bracelets. I’m aware. Would you like a chance to repay that debt?\" The woman bowed herself, forehead to the ground again. Egwene sighed, but before she could order the woman to rise, Leilwin spoke. \"By the Light and my hope for salvation and rebirth\", Leilwin said, \"I vow to serve you and protect you, Amyrlin, ruler of the White Tower. By the Crystal Throne and the blood of the Empress, I bind myself to you, to do as commanded in all things, and to put your life before my own. Under the Light, may it be so\". She kissed the floor. Egwene looked at her, stunned. Only a Darkfriend would betray an oath such as that one. Of course, every Seanchan was close to being a Darkfriend. \"You think I m not well protected?\" Egwene asked. \"You think that I need another servant?\" \"I think only of repaying my debt\", Leilwin said. In her tone, Egwene sensed a stiffness, a bitterness. That rang of authenticity. This woman did not like humbling herself in this manner. Egwene folded her arms, troubled. \"What can you tell me of the Seanchan military, its arms and strength, and of the plans of the Empress?\" \"I know some things, Amyrlin\", Leilwin said. \"But I was a ship’s captain. What I do know is of the Seanchan navy, and that will be of little use to you\". Of course, Egwene thought. She glanced at Gawyn, who shrugged. \"Please\", Leilwin said softly. \"Allow me to prove myself to you somehow. I have little left to me. My name itself is no longer my own\". First, Egwene said, \"you will talk of the Seanchan. I don’t care if you think it’s irrelevant. Anything you tell me might be helpful\". Or, it might reveal Leilwin as a liar, which would be equally useful. \"Gawyn, fetch me a chair. I’m going to listen to what she says. After that, we’ll see . . \". Rand rifled through the pile of maps, notes and reports. He stood with his arm folded behind his back, a single lamp burning on the desk. Sheathed in glass, the flame danced as breezes eddied through the tent where he stood alone. Was the flame alive? It ate, it moved on its own. You could smother it, so in a way, it breathed. What was it to be alive? Could an idea live? A world without the Dark One. A world without evil. Rand turned back to the maps. What he saw impressed him. Elayne was preparing well. He had not attended the meetings planning each battle. His attention was directed toward the north. Toward Shayol Ghul. His destiny. His grave. He hated the way these battle maps, with notes for formations and groups, reduced men’s lives to scribbles on a page. Numbers and statistics. Oh, he admitted that the clarity—the distance—was essential for a battlefield commander. He hated it nonetheless. Here before him was a flame that lived, yet here were also men who were dead. Now that he could not lead the war himself, he hoped to stay away from maps such as this one. He knew seeing these preparations would make him grieve for the so","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-74.html","bookId":1601,"book":{"id":1601,"title":"A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14)","description":"Storyline: A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14) “And it came to pass in those days, as it had come before and would come again, that the Dark lay heavy on the land and weighed down the hearts of men, and the green things failed, and hope died.” From Charal Drianaan te Calamon, The Cycle of the Dragon.
