What about Galgan?\"\n \"A dagger rammed through the heart of a raven\".\n \"Bloody ashes . . \".\n \"I don’t think it means you\", she added. \"I can’t say why\".\n Galgan was speaking with some lesser nobles. At least, they had more hair than he did, which was the Seanchan mark of a lesser. Their tones were hushed, and Galgan would occasionally glance over at Mat.\n \"He doesn’t know what to make of me\", Mat said softly.\n \"How very uncommon. I can’t think of anyone else who has reacted that way to you, Mat\".\n \"Ha ha. You’re sure that bloody dagger doesn’t mean me? Ravens . . . well, ravens kind of mean me, right? Sometimes? I’m the flaming Prince of the bloody Ravens now\".\n \"It’s not you\".\n \"He’s trying to decide when to assassinate me\", Mat said softly, gaze narrowing toward Galgan. I ve been put right beneath him in the army, and he worries I will supplant him. Tuon says he’s a dedicated soldier, so he’ll wait until after the Last Battle to strike\".\n \"That’s awful!\"\n \"I know\", Mat said. \"He won’t play cards with me first. I was hoping I could win him over. Lose on purpose a few times\".\n \"I don’t think you could manage that\".\n \"Actually, I figured out how to lose bloody ages ago\". He seemed to be completely serious. \"Tuon says it would be a sign of disrespect if he didn’t try to kill me. They’re insane, Min. They’re all bloody insane\".\n \"I’m sure Egwene would help you escape if you ask, Mat\".\n \"Well, I didn’t say they weren’t fun. Just insane\". He straightened his hat. \"But if any more of them bloody well try to—\"\n He cut off as the guards outside the door dropped to their knees, then completely prostrated themselves on the ground. Mat sighed. \"‘Say the name of Darkness, and his eye is upon you.’ Yalu kazath d’Zamon patra Dae-seia asa darshi. \"\n \" . . . What?\" Min asked.\n \"You don’t know that one either?\" Mat said. \"Doesn’t anyone bloody read anymore?\"\n The Seanchan Empress stepped through the door. Min was surprised to see her wearing not a dress, but wide silvery trousers. Or . . . well, maybe it was a dress. Min couldn’t tell if those were skirts that had been divided for riding, or if it was a pair of trousers with very enveloping legs. Fortuona’s top was of tight scarlet silk, and over it she wore an open-fronted blue robe with a very long train. It seemed the clothing of a warrior, a kind of uniform.\n The people in the room fell to their knees, then bowed themselves down all the way to the floor, even General Galgan. Mat stayed standing.\n Gritting her teeth, Min went down on one knee. The woman was the Empress, after all. Min wouldn’t bow to Mat or the generals, but it was only proper to show respect to Fortuona.\n \"Who is this one, Knotai?\" Fortuona asked, curious. \"She thinks herself high\".\n \"Oh, well\", Mat said idly, \"she’s just the Dragon Reborn’s woman\". Catrona, who at the side of the room had bowed herself to the ground, made a strangled sound. She looked up at Min with bulging eyes.\n Light, Min thought. She probably thinks she’s offended me or something\n \"How curious\", Fortuona said. \"That would make her your equal, Knotai. Of course, you seem to have forgotten to bow again\".\n \"My father would be mortified\", Mat said. \"He always did pride himself on my memory\".\n \"You embarrass me in public again\".\n \"Only as much as I embarrass myself\". He smiled, then hesitated, as if thinking through those words a second time.\n The Empress smiled as well, though she looked distinctly predatory. She moved into the room, and the people rose, so Min climbed to her feet. Mat immediately began to push her toward the door.\n \"Mat, wait\", Min whispered.\n \"Just keep moving\", he said. \"Don’t risk her deciding to snatch you up. She’s not particularly good at letting things go, once she has them in hand\". He actually sounded proud, saying that.\n You’re as crazy as they are, Min thought. \"Mat, a bloody flower\".\n \"What?\" he said, still shoving her.\n \"A bloody flower around her head\", Min said. \"A death lily. Someone is going to try to kill her very soon\".\n Mat froze. Fortuona turned sharply.\n Min didn’t realize that two guards were moving until they had her pressed against the ground. They were the odd ones in the black armor—though now that she was close, Min could see it was actually a dark green.\n Idiot, she thought as they pressed her face against the floor. I should have let Mat pull me from the room first. She hadn’t made a mistake like that—speaking of one of her viewings loud enough for others to hear—in years. What was wrong with her?\n \"Stop!\" Mat said. \"Let her up!\"\n Mat might have been elevated to the Blood, but the guards obviously had no problem ignoring a direct order from him.\n \"How does she know this, Knotai?\" Fortuona asked, stepping up to Mat. She sounded angry. Perhaps disappointed. \"What is happening?\"\n \"It’s not what you assume, Tuon\", Mat said.\n No, don’t—\n \"She sees things\", Mat continued. \"It’s nothing to get all angry about. It’s just a trick of the Pattern, Tuon. Min sees visions around people, like little pictures. She didn’t mean anything by what she said\". He laughed. It was forced.\n The room grew very still. It was so quiet, Min could once again hear the explosions in the distance.\n \"Doomseer\", Fortuona whispered.\n The guards suddenly let her free, backing away. Min groaned, sitting up. The guards had moved to protect the Empress, but one who had touched her pulled his gauntlets off and tossed them to the ground. He wiped his hand against his breastplate, as if trying to clean his skin of something.\n Fortuona didn’t seem afraid. She stepped up to Min, lips parting, almost in awe. The young Empress reached out and touched Min’s face. \"What he says . . . it is true?\"\n \"Yes\u0026quo \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-167.html","bookId":1601,"book":{"id":1601,"title":"A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14)","description":"Storyline: \n A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14) \n “And it came to pass in those days, as it had come before and would come again, that the Dark lay heavy on the land and weighed down the hearts of men, and the green things failed, and hope died.” From Charal Drianaan te Calamon, The Cycle of the Dragon. \n In the Field of Merrilor the rulers of the nations gather to join behind Rand al’Thor, or to stop him from his plan to break the seals on the Dark One’s prison—which may be a sign of his madness, or the last hope of humankind.
