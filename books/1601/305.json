He turned his back on it and walked off.\n Three steps away, he found his hat. He grinned, snatched it up and set it on his head, then began whistling as he rested the ashandarei on his shoulder and strolled away. The dice had stopped rolling in Mat’s head.\n Behind, the dagger, ruby and all, melted away into the mess that had been Padan Fain.\n Perrin walked wearily into the camp they had set up at the base of Shayol Ghul after the fighting had ceased. He dropped his coat. The air felt good on his bare chest. He tucked Mah’alleinir away in its place at his belt. A good smith never neglected his tools, for all that sometimes, carrying them felt as if they would bear him down to the grave itself.\n He thought that he could sleep a hundred days straight. But not yet. Not yet.\n Faile.\n No. Deep down, he knew he had to face something horrible about her. But not yet. For the moment, he shoved that worry—that terror—away.\n The last spirits of the wolves faded back into the wolf dream.\n Farewell, Young Bull.\n Find what you seek, Young Bull.\n The hunt ends, but we will hunt again, Young Bull.\n Perrin plodded among rows of wounded men and Aiel celebrating the defeat of the Shadowspawn. Some tents were filled with moans, others with yells of victory. People of all stripes ran through the now-blooming valley of Thakan’dar, some hunting for the wounded, others crying in joy and whooping as they met with friends who had survived the last, dark moments.\n Aiel called to Perrin, \"Ho, blacksmith, join us!\" But he did not enter their celebrations. He looked for the guards. Someone around here had to be levelheaded enough to worry about a rogue Myrddraal or Draghkar taking the opportunity to try for a little revenge. Sure enough, he found a ring of defenders at the center of camp guarding a large tent. What of Rand?\n No colors swirled in his vision. No image of Rand. Perrin felt no more tugging, pulling him in any direction.\n Those seemed like very bad signs.\n He pushed through the guards, numb, and entered the tent. Where had they found a tent this large on this battlefield? Everything had been trampled, blown away or burned.\n The inside smelled of herbs, and was partitioned with several hanging cloths.\n \"I’ve tried everything\", a voice whispered. Damer Flinn’s voice. \"Nothing changes what is happening. He—\"\n Perrin pushed in on Nynaeve and Flinn standing beside a pallet behind one of the partitions. Rand, cleaned and dressed, lay there, eyes closed. Moiraine knelt beside him, her hand on his face, whispering so softly none but he could hear. \"You did well, Rand. You did well\".\n \"He lives?\" Perrin asked, wiping the sweat from his face with his hand.\n \"Perrin!\" Nynaeve said. \"Oh, Light. You look horrible. Sit down, you lummox! You’re going to fall over. I don’t want two of you to tend\".\n Her eyes were red. \"He’s dying anyway, isn’t he?\" Perrin asked. \"You got him out alive, but he’s still going to die\".\n \"Sit\", Nynaeve commanded, pointing to a stool.\n \"Dogs obey that command, Nynaeve\", Perrin said, \"not wolves\". He knelt down, resting a hand on Rand’s shoulder.\n I couldn’t feel your tugging, or see the visions, Perrin thought. You’re no longer ta’veren. I suspect neither am I. \"Have you sent for the three?\" Perrin asked. \"Min, Elayne, Aviendha. They need to visit him a last time\".\n \"That’s all you can say?\" Nynaeve snapped.\n He looked up at her. The way she folded her arms made her look as if she were holding herself together. Wrapping her arms about herself to stop from crying.\n \"Who else died?\" Perrin asked, bracing himself. It was obvious from her expression. She had lost one already.\n \"Egwene\".\n Perrin closed his eyes, breathing out. Egwene. Light.\n No masterwork comes without a price, he thought. That doesn’t mean it’s not worth forging Still . . . Egwene?\n \"It’s not your fault, Nynaeve\", he said, opening his eyes.\n \"Of course it’s not. I know it’s not, you numb-brained fool\". She turned away.\n He stood up, embracing her and patting her back with his smith’s hands. \"I’m sorry\".\n \"I left . . . to save you\", Nynaeve whispered. \"I only came along to protect you\".\n \"You did, Nynaeve. You protected Rand so he could do what he had to do\".\n She shook, and he let her weep. Light. He shed a few tears himself. Nynaeve pulled away sharply after a moment, then barreled out of the tent.\n \"I tried\", Flinn said desperately, looking at Rand. \"Nynaeve did, too. Together, we tried, with Moiraine Sedai’s angreal. Nothing worked. Nobody knows how to save him\".\n \"You did what you could\", Perrin said, peeking around the next partition. Another man lay on the pallet there. \"What is he doing here?\"\n \"We found them together\", Flinn said. \"Rand must have carried him out of the pit. We don’t know why the Lord Dragon would save one of the Forsaken, but it doesn’t matter. We can’t Heal him either. They’re dying. Both of them\".\n \"Send for Min, Elayne and Aviendha\", Perrin said again. He hesitated. \"Did they all survive?\"\n \"The Aiel girl took a beating\", Flinn said. \"She came stumbling into camp, half-carried by a horrid-looking Aes Sedai who had made a gateway for her. She’ll live, though I don’t know how well she’ll walk in years to come\".\n \"Let them know. All of them\".\n Flinn nodded, and Perrin stepped out after Nynaeve. He found what he’d hoped to see, the reason why she’d left so quickly. Just outside the tent, Lan held her tightly. The man looked as bloodied and tired as Perrin felt. Their eyes met, and they nodded to one another.\n \"Several of the Windfinders have opened a gateway between here and Merrilor\", Lan said to Perrin. \"The Dark One is sealed away again. The Blasted Lands are blooming, and gateways can open here again\".\n \"Thank you\", Perrin said, passing him by. \"Has anyone . . . heard anything about Faile?\"\n \"No, blacksmith. The Hornsounder saw her last, but she left him and entered the battlefield to draw the Trollocs away from him. I’m sorry\".\n Perrin nodded. He’d already spoken with Mat, and Olver. It seemed to him that . . . that he’d been avoiding thinking about \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-305.html","bookId":1601,"book":{"id":1601,"title":"A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14)","description":"Storyline: \n A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14) \n “And it came to pass in those days, as it had come before and would come again, that the Dark lay heavy on the land and weighed down the hearts of men, and the green things failed, and hope died.” From Charal Drianaan te Calamon, The Cycle of the Dragon. \n In the Field of Merrilor the rulers of the nations gather to join behind Rand al’Thor, or to stop him from his plan to break the seals on the Dark One’s prison—which may be a sign of his madness, or the last hope of humankind.
