Their blood had not been required this day.\n \"That was impressive\", Gawyn said, pulling his horse up beside hers. \"It was as if they were assaulting city walls, trying to run ladders to a siege . . . only without the walls or the ladders\".\n \"They’ll return\", Egwene said tiredly. \"We killed just a small percentage of them\".\n On the morrow, or the day after at the latest, they would try again. New tactics, perhaps—they might spread out waves of attackers to make it more difficult for the Aes Sedai to kill large batches of them at once.\n \"We surprised them\", Egwene said. \"They will come stronger next time. For now, for this night, we’ve held\".\n \"You didn’t just hold, Egwene\", Gawyn said with a smile. \"You sent them running. I don’t know that I’ve ever seen an army so thoroughly trounced\".\n The rest of the army seemed to agree with Gawyn’s assessment, for they began to cheer, raising weapons. Egwene forced back her fatigue and tucked away the fluted rod. Nearby, other Aes Sedai lowered small statues, bracelets, brooches, rings and rods. They had emptied the White Tower’s storehouse of every angreal and sa’angreal—the few of those they had—and distributed them among the sisters on the battlefront. At the end of each day, they would be collected and delivered to the women providing Healing.\n The Aes Sedai turned and rode back through the cheering army. The time for sorrows would, unfortunately, come. The Aes Sedai could not fight each battle. For now, however, Egwene was content to let the soldiers enjoy their victory, for it was the very best kind. The kind that left no holes in their ranks.\n \"The Lord Dragon and his scouts have begun to reconnoiter Shayol Ghul\". Bashere pointed to one of the shaded maps. \"Our resistance in Kandor and Shienar is forcing the Shadow to commit more and more troops to those fights. Soon, the Blasted Lands will be mostly empty, save for a skeleton force of defenders. He will be able to strike more easily then\".\n Elayne nodded. She could feel Rand somewhere in the back of her mind. He was worried about something, though he was too distant for her to feel more than that. He occasionally visited her, at her camp in the Braem Wood, but for now he was on one of the other battlefronts.\n Bashere continued. \"The Amyrlin should be able to hold in Kandor, considering the number of channelers she has. I’m not worried about her\".\n \"But you are about the Borderlanders\", Elayne said.\n \"Yes. They’ve been pushed out of Tarwin’s Gap\".\n \"I wish they had been able to hold where they were, but they’ve been overwhelmed. There is nothing to be done for it save siphon to them what aid we can\".\n Bashere nodded. \"Perhaps Lord Mandragoran could reverse his retreat if he had more Aes Sedai or Asha’man\".\n Of which there were none to spare. She had sent him some Aes Sedai from Egwene’s army to help him with his initial retreat, and that had helped. But if Rand himself couldn’t fight off the Dreadlords there . . .\n \"Lord Agelmar will know what to do\", Elayne said. \"The Light willing, he’ll be able to pull the Trollocs away from more populated areas\".\n Bashere grunted. \"A retreat like this—almost a rout—usually affords no chance for directing the course of battle\". Bashere pointed toward the map of Shienar.\n Elayne studied it. The path of the Trollocs would not avoid inhabited land. Fal Dara, Mos Shirare, Fal Moran . . . And with Dreadlords, city walls would be useless.\n \"Send word to Lan and the lords of Shienar\", she said quietly. \"Order Fal Dara and Ankor Dail burned, along with Fal Moran and villages like Medo. They’re already burning what farmland they can—emptying the cities as well. Evacuate the civilians to Tar Valon\".\n \"I’m sorry\", Bashere said softly.\n \"It is what must be done, isn’t it?\"\n \"Yes\", Bashere said.\n Light, what a mess. Well, what did you expect? Neatness and simplicity?\n Footsteps on the leaves announced Talmanes approaching with one of his commanders. The Cairhienin looked tired. Everyone did. A week of battle was only the beginning, but the thrill of the fight was dying. Now came the real work of the war. Days fighting or waiting to fight, nights spent sleeping with sword in hand.\n Elayne’s current location in the Wood—she’d begun the morning a thousand paces further south, but their constant retreat through the forest kept her moving—was ideal. Three small streams with easy access, room for plenty of troops to camp, trees atop the hill that worked as well as watchtowers. A pity they’d have to leave this site behind in the morning.\n \"The Trollocs control the entire southern section of the forest\", Bashere said, knuckling his mustaches. \"They are avoiding the clearings. That means our cavalry won’t be able to operate effectively\".\n \"The dragons are practically useless in here, Your Majesty\", Talmanes said, entering the tent. \"Now that the Trollocs are keeping off the roadways, we have trouble doing any damage. It’s nearly impossible to maneuver the dragon carts in the forest, and when we do get a shot, we kill more trees than we do Shadowspawn\".\n \"What of that . . . whatever it was that Aludra was talking about?\"\n \"Her dragon teeth?\" Talmanes said. \"It’s better—the dragon shoots out a bunch of bits of metal, rather than one ball. It has a big spread to it, and works reasonably well inside the forest, but I maintain that the dragons are doing less damage than it is worth risking them to achieve\".\n \"I think that the forest has done us the good it can\", Bashere said, moving some Trolloc tokens on their maps. \"We have whittled down their numbers, but they’re getting smart, keeping to the thick woods and trying to surround us\".\n \"Suggestions?\"\n \"Pull back\", Bashere said. \"Head out to the east of here\".\n \"Make for the Erinin? There’s no bridge this far north\", Talmanes said. Bashere nodded. \"So you know what I’m going to ask. You have a company of men who can build bridges. Send them with some of your dragons for protection and have them build raft bridges directly east of us. The rest of us won’t be far behind. The open terrain there will give our cavalry and the dragons the chance to do more damage. We can rely on the Erinin to slow the Trollocs, especially once we torch the bridges. A few dragons placed there should slow their progress. We’ll continue east to the Alguenya, and repeat the process. Then we’ll be on the road to Cairhien. We’ll head north and when we find a suitable place to make a stand—I think I know just the spot—we’ll turn and face the Shadow with Cai \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-92.html","bookId":1601,"book":{"id":1601,"title":"A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14)","description":"Storyline: \n A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14) \n “And it came to pass in those days, as it had come before and would come again, that the Dark lay heavy on the land and weighed down the hearts of men, and the green things failed, and hope died.” From Charal Drianaan te Calamon, The Cycle of the Dragon. \n In the Field of Merrilor the rulers of the nations gather to join behind Rand al’Thor, or to stop him from his plan to break the seals on the Dark One’s prison—which may be a sign of his madness, or the last hope of humankind.
