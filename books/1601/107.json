Was everyone going to ask him about it that way? \"I went through a rough patch\", he said. \"I made it through alive, which is all that matters\".\n \"Hmm. And did you save her? The one you went to rescue?\"\n \"How did you know about that?\"\n She did not reply. \"I have decided not to be jealous. You are fortunate. The missing eye suits you. Before, you were too pretty\".\n Too pretty? Light. What did that mean?\n \"Good to see you, by the way\", Mat said. He waited a few moments. \"Usually, when a fellow says something like that, it’s customary to tell them that you’re happy to see them as well\".\n \"I am the Empress now\", Tuon said. \"I do not wait upon others, and do not find it good that someone has returned. Their return is expected, as they serve me\".\n \"You know how to make a fellow feel loved. Well, I know how you feel about me\".\n \"And how is that?\"\n \"You looked over your shoulder\".\n She shook her head. \"I had forgotten that you are supremely good at saying that which has no meaning, Matrim\".\n \"When you saw me\", Mat explained, \"with a dagger in hand—as if to throw at you—you didn’t call for your guards. You didn’t fear I was here to kill you. You looked over your shoulder to see what I was aiming at. That’s the most loving gesture I think a man could receive from a woman. Unless you’d like to sit on my knee for a little while . . \".\n She did not reply. Light, but she seemed cold. Was it all going to be different, now that she was the Empress? He could not have lost her already, could he?\n Furyk Karede, the captain of the Deathwatch Guard, soon arrived with Musenge walking behind him. Karede looked like he had just found his house on fire. The other Deathwatch Guards saluted him and seemed to wither before him.\n \"Empress, my eyes are lowered\", Karede said, going down on his belly before her. \"I will join those who failed you in spilling our lives before you as soon as a new squad has arrived to see to your protection\".\n \"Your lives are mine\", Tuon said, \"and you do not end them unless I give you leave. This assassin was not of natural birth, but a creation of the Shadow. Your eyes are not lowered. The Prince of the Ravens will teach you how to spot this kind of creature, so you will not be so surprised again\". Mat was fairly certain that Gray Men were of natural birth, but then, so were Trollocs and Fades. It did not seem appropriate to point this out to Tuon. Besides, something else in her orders drew his attention.\n \"I’m going to do what, now?\" Mat asked.\n \"Teach them\", Tuon said softly. \"You are Prince of the Ravens. This will be part of your duties\".\n \"We need to talk about that\", Mat said. \"Everyone calling me ‘Highness’ is not going to do, Tuon. It just won’t\".\n She did not reply. She waited as the search proceeded, and made no move to retreat to the palace.\n Finally, Karede approached again. \"Highest One, there is no sign of the thing in the gardens, but one of my men has found blood on the wall. I suspect the assassin fled into the city\".\n \"He is unlikely to try again tonight\", Tuon said, \"while we are alerted. Do not spread news of this to the common soldiers or guards. Inform my Voice that our ruse has stopped being effective, and that we will need to consider a new one\".\n \"Yes, Empress\", Karede said, bowing low again.\n \"For now\", Tuon said, \"clear out and secure the perimeter. I will be spending time with my consort, who has requested that I ‘make him feel loved.’ \"\n \"That’s not exactly—\" Mat said as the members of the Deathwatch Guard faded into the darkness.\n Tuon studied Mat for a moment, then began to disrobe.\n \"Light!\" Mat said. \"You meant it?\"\n \"I’m not going to sit on your knee\", Tuon said, pulling one arm out of her robe, exposing her br**sts, \"though I may allow you to sit on mine. Tonight, you have saved my life. That will earn you special privilege. It—\"\n She cut off as Mat grabbed her and kissed her. She was tense with surprise. In the bloody garden, he thought. With soldiers standing all about, well within earshot. Well, if she expected Matrim Cauthon to be shy, she had a surprise coming.\n He released her lips from the kiss. Her body was pressed against his, and he was pleased to find her breathless.\n \"I won’t be your toy\", Mat said sternly. \"I won’t have it, Tuon. If you intend it to be that way, I will leave. Mark me. Sometimes, I do play the fool. With Tylin, I did for sure. I won’t have that with you\".\n She reached up and touched his face, surprisingly tender. \"I would not have said the words I did if I had found in you only a toy. A man missing an eye is no toy anyway. You have known battle; everyone who sees you now will know that. They will not mistake you for a fool, and I have no use for a toy. I shall have a prince instead\".\n \"And do you love me?\" he asked, forcing the words out.\n \"An empress does not love\", she said. \"I am sorry. I am with you because the omens state it so, and so with you I will bring the Seanchan an heir\".\n Mat had a sinking feeling.\n \"However\", Tuon said. \"Perhaps I can admit that it is . . . good to see you\".\n Well, Mat thought, guess I can take that. For now.\n He kissed her again.\n CHAPTER 16\n A Silence Like Screaming\n Loial, son of Arent son of Halan, had secretly always wanted to be hasty.\n Humans fascinated him, of that he made no secret. He was sure most of his friends knew, though he could not be certain. It amazed him what humans didn’t hear. Loial could speak to them all day, then find that they had heard only part. Did they think that someone would speak without intending for others to listen?\n Loial listened when they spoke. Every word out of their mouths revealed more about them. Humans were like the lightning. A flash, an explosion, power and energy.
