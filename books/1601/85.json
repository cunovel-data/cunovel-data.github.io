They simply have to give themselves time to cool down and think\".\n \"Duels aren’t about thinking\", Kathana said. \"But I suppose it does mean that I don’t have to worry about your pretty face being cut up on the street\".\n Jame snorted, resting his hand on his sword. The hilt, Mat noticed for the first time, was marked with herons—though he could not see if the blade was or not. Before Mat could ask another question, Kathana marched away and began squawking at some men who had spilled ale on their table. She did not seem the type to stand in one place for very long.\n \"Hows the weather, to the north?\" Jame asked, eyes still straight ahead.\n \"Dreary\", Mat replied, honestly. \"As everywhere\".\n \"Men say it’s the Last Battle\", Jame said.\n \"It is\".\n Jame grunted. \"If it is, it would be a bad time for interfering with politics, wouldn’t you think?\"\n \"Bloody right it would be\", Mat said. \"People need to stop playing games and have a look at the sky\".\n Jame eyed him. \"That’s the truth. You should listen to what you are saying\".\n Light, Mat thought. He must think I\u0027m a spy of some sort. \"It’s not my choice\", Mat said. \"Sometimes, people will only listen to what they want to hear\". He took another bite of his meat, which tasted as good as could be expected. Eating a meal these days was like going to a dance where there were only ugly girls. This, however, was among the better of the bad that he had had the misfortune of eating, lately.\n \"A wise man might just learn the truth\", Jame said.\n \"You have to find the truth first\", Mat said. \"It’s harder than most men think\".\n From behind, Kathana snorted, bustling past. \"The ‘truth’ is something men debate in bars when they’re too drunk to remember their names. That means it’s not in good company. I wouldn’t put too much stock in it, traveler\".\n \"The name’s Mandevwin\", Mat said.\n \"I’m sure it is\", Kathana said. She looked him over then. \"Has anyone ever told you that you should wear a hat? It would fit the missing eye quite well\".\n \"Is that so\", Mat said dryly. \"You give fashion advice as well as force-feeding men?\"\n She swatted him on the back of the head with her cleaning rag. \"Eat your food\".\n \"Look, friend\", Jame said, turning toward him. \"I know what you are and why you are here. The fake eye bandage is not fooling me. You have throwing knives tucked into your sleeves and six more on your belt that I can count. I’ve never met a man with one eye who could throw worth a dried bean. She’s not as easy a target as you foreigners think. You’ll never make it into the palace, let alone through her bodyguards. Go find some honest work instead\".\n Mat gaped at the man. He thought Mat was an assassin? Mat reached up and took off the bandage, exposing the hole where his eye had been. Jame started at that.\n \"There are assassins\", Mat said calmly, \"after Tuon?\"\n \"Don’t use her name like that\", Kathana said, beginning to snap her cleaning rag at him again.\n Mat reached up beside his head without looking, catching the tip of the rag. He held Jame\u0027s eyes with his single one, not flinching.\n \"There are assassins\", Mat repeated calmly, \"after Tuon?\"\n Jame nodded. \"Mostly foreigners who don’t know the right way of things. Several have moved through the inn. Only one admitted the reason he was here. I saw that his blood fed the dusty earth of the dueling grounds\".\n \"Then I count you a friend\", Mat said, standing. He reached into his bundle and took out his hat and put it upon his head. \"Who is behind it? Who has brought them in, put the bounty on her head?\"\n Nearby, Kathana inspected his hat and nodded in satisfaction. Then she hesitated and squinted at his face.\n \"This isn’t what you think\", Jame said. \"He isn’t hiring the best assassins. They’re foreigners, so they aren’t meant to succeed\".\n \"I don’t care how bloody likely their chances are\", Mat said. \"Who is hiring them?\"\n \"He’s too important for you to—\"\n \"Who?\" Mat said softly.\n \"General Lunal Galgan\", Jame said. \"Head of the Seanchan armies. I can’t make you out, friend. Are you an assassin, or are you here hunting assassins?\"\n \"I’m no bloody assassin\", Mat said, pulling the brim of his hat down and picking up his bundle. \"I never kill a man unless he demands it—demands it with screams and thunder so loudly, I figure it would be impolite not to agree to the request. If I stab you, friend, you’ll know that it is coming, and you will know why. I promise you that\".\n \"Jame\", Kathana hissed. \"It’s him\"\n \"What now?\" Jame asked as Mat brushed past, raising his covered ashandarei to his shoulder.\n \"The one the guards have been looking for!\" Kathana said. She looked to Mat. \"Light! Every soldier in Ebou Dar has been told to watch for your face. How did you make it through the city gates?\"\n \"By luck\", Mat said, then stepped out into the alleyway.\n \"What are you waiting for?\" Moiraine asked.\n Rand turned toward her. They stood in Lan’s command tent in Shienar. He could smell the smoke of burning fields, set aflame by Lan and Lord Agelmar\u0027s troops as they withdrew from the Gap.\n They were burning the lands they would rather defend. A desperate tactic, but a good one. It was the sort of all-in tactic that Lews Therin and his people in the Age of Legends had been hesitant to try, at least at first. It had cost them dearly then.\n The Borderlanders showed no such timidity.\n \"Why are we here?\" Moiraine pressed, stepping up to him. His Maidens guarded the tent from the inside; better to not let the enemy know Rand was here. \"You should be at Shayol Ghul right now. That is your destiny, Rand al’Thor. Not these lesser fights\".\n \"My friends die here\".\n \"I thought you were beyond such weaknesses\".\n \"Compassion is not a weakness\".\n \"Is it not?\" she said. \"And if, in sparing your enemy because of compassion, you allow them to kill you? What then, \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-85.html","bookId":1601,"book":{"id":1601,"title":"A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14)","description":"Storyline: \n A Memory of Light (The Wheel of Time #14) \n “And it came to pass in those days, as it had come before and would come again, that the Dark lay heavy on the land and weighed down the hearts of men, and the green things failed, and hope died.” From Charal Drianaan te Calamon, The Cycle of the Dragon. \n In the Field of Merrilor the rulers of the nations gather to join behind Rand al’Thor, or to stop him from his plan to break the seals on the Dark One’s prison—which may be a sign of his madness, or the last hope of humankind.
