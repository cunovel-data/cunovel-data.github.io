What else could he say? \"Perrin, you need to know something else. Fain is here on this battlefield\".\n \"Fain?\" Perrin growled. \"Where?\"\n \"He’s in that mist! Perrin, he’s brought Mashadar, somehow. Don’t let it touch you\".\n \"I was in Shadar Logoth too, Mat\", Perrin said. \"I have a debt to settle with Fain\".\n \"And I don’t?\" Mat said. \"I—\"\n Perrin’s eyes opened wide. He stared at Mat’s chest.\n There, a small white ribbon of silvery mist—Mashadar’s mist—had speared Mat from behind through the chest. Mat looked at it, jerked once, then tumbled off his horse.\n CHAPTER 47\n Watching the Flow Writhe\n Aviendha struggled on the slopes of the valley of Thakan’dar, trying to avoid the shield of Spirit Graendal was attempting to slip into place. A weave, like lace, defying her attempts to reach for the One Power. Her feet ruined, she could not stand. She lay, in pain, barely able to move.\n She fought it off, but barely.\n The Forsaken leaned against the rocks of the ledge, as she had been doing for a short time, muttering to herself. Her side bled bright red blood. Below them, in the valley, the battle raged. A silvery white mist was rolling across the dead and some of the living.\n Aviendha tried to crawl toward her gateway. That lay open still, and through it she could see the valley floor. Something must have drawn Cadsuane and the others away—either that, or Aviendha had made the gateway to the wrong place.\n The glow of saidar surrounded Graendal again. More weaves; Aviendha broke them, but they delayed her progress toward the gateway.\n Graendal groaned, then pulled herself upright. She staggered in Aviendha’s direction, though the woman looked dazed by her blood loss.\n Aviendha could do little to defend herself, weak as she was from blood loss. She was helpless.\n Except . . .The Cave for her gateway, the one she had tied off. It still hung there holding the portal open. Ribbons of lace.\n Carefully hesitant but desperate, Aviendha reached out mentally and pulled one of the threads loose in the gateway. She could do it. The flow shivered and vanished.\n It was something the Aiel did, but something Aes Sedai thought terribly dangerous The results could be unpredictable. An explosion, a small shower of sparks . . . Aviendha could end up stilled. Or maybe nothing at all would happen. When Elayne had tried it, it had caused a devastating explosion\n That would be fine with her. If she brought down one of the Forsaken alongside her, that would be a wonderful death.\n She had to try.\n Graendal stopped near Aviendha and grumbled to herself, eyes closed.\n When the woman opened her eyes and began crafting another weave. Compulsion.\n Aviendha picked faster, pulling two, three, half a dozen threads free of the gateway. Almost, almost . . .\n What are you doing? Graendal demanded.\n Aviendha picked faster, and in her haste, picked at the wrong thread. She froze, watching the flow writhe, setting off the others near it.\n Graendal hissed, and began to set the Compulsion on Aviendha.\n The gateway exploded in a flash of light and heat.\n Shaisam seized the battlefield, his mist shoving through those wolves and men who thought to bar his way to al’Thor.\n Yes, al’Thor. The one he would kill, destroy, feast upon. Yes, al’Thor!\n Something trembled at one edge of his senses. Shaisam hesitated, frowning to himself. What was wrong there? A piece of him . . . a piece of him had stopped sensing.\n What was this? He ran his physical form across the ground through the mist. Blood trailed from his fingers, flayed by the dagger he carried, the wonderful seed, the last bit of his old self.\n He came upon a corpse, one that his mists had killed. Shaisam frowned bending down. That body looked familiar . . .\n The corpses hand reached up and grabbed Shaisam by the throat. He gasped, thrashing, as the corpse opened its eye.\n \"There’s an odd thing about diseases I once heard, Fain\", Matrim Cauthon whispered. \"Once you catch a disease and survive, you cant get it again\".\n Shaisam thrashed, panicked. No. No, this was not how a meeting with an old friend should go! He clawed at the hand holding him, then realized with horror that he’d dropped the dagger.\n Cauthon pulled him down, slamming him to the ground. Shaisam called for his drones. Too late! Too slow!\n \"I’ve come to give you your gift back, Mordeth\", Cauthon whispered. \"I consider our debt paid in full\".\n Cauthon rammed the dagger right between the ribs, into Shaisam’s heart. Tied to this pitiful mortal form, Mordeth screamed. Padan Fain howled, and felt his flesh melting from his bones. The mists trembled, began to swirl and shake.\n Together they died.\n Perrin shifted to the wolf dream and found Gaul by tracing the scent of blood. He had hated to leave Mat with Mashadar, but was confident—from a look Mat had given him after falling—that his friend could survive the mist, and knew what he was doing.\n Gaul had hidden himself well, pushed up into a split in the rock just outside the Pit of Doom. Gaul still carried one spear and had darkened his clothing to match the rocks around him.\n He was nodding off when Perrin found him. Gaul was not only wounded, but had been in the wolf dream far too long. If Perrin felt an aching exhaustion, it must be worse for Gaul.\n \"Come, Gaul\", Perrin said, helping him out of the rocks.\n Gaul looked dazed. \"Nobody passed me by\", he mumbled. \"I watched, Perrin Aybara. The Car’a’carn is safe\".\n \"You did well, my friend\", Perrin replied. \"Better than anyone could have expected. You have much honor\".\n Gaul smiled as he leaned on Perrin’s shoulder. \"I worried . . . when the wolves vanished, I worried\".\n \"They fight on in the waking world\". Perrin felt a need to return here. Finding Gaul had been part of that, but there was something else, a drive he couldn’t explain.\n \"Hold on\", Perrin said, grabbing Gaul about the waist. He shifted them to the Field of Merrilor, then shifted them out of the wolf dream and appeared in the center of the Two Rivers camp.\n People immediately locked on Perrin, yells rising. \"Light, Perrin!\" a man said nearby. Grady rushed up, deep bags beneath his eyes. \"I nearly burned you to char, Lord Goldeneyes.
