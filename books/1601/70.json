Androl feigned unconsciousness, but someone kicked him. \"I saw you talking, pageboy\", Mishraile said, leaning down his golden-haired head. \"I’m going to enjoy killing you for what you did to Coteren\". Androl opened his eyes and saw Logain sagging in the grip of Mezar and Welyn. They dragged him near and dropped him roughly to the ground. Logain stirred and groaned as they tied him up. They stood, and one spat on Androl before moving over to Emarin. \"No\", Taim said from somewhere near. \"The youth is next. The Great Lord demands results. Logain is taking too long\". Evin’s sobs grew louder as Mezar and Welyn moved over to seize him under the arms. \"No!\" Androl said, twisting. \"No! Taim, burn you! Leave him alone! Take me!\" Taim stood nearby, hands clasped behind his back, in a sharp black uniform that resembled those of the Asha’man, but trimmed with silver. He wore no pins at his neck. He turned toward Androl, then sneered. \"Take you? I am to present to the Great Lord a man who couldn’t channel enough to break a pebble? I should have culled you long ago\". Taim followed the other two, who were dragging away the frantic Evin. Androl screamed at them, yelling until he was hoarse. They took Evin somewhere on the other side of the chamber—it was very large—and Androl could not see them because of the angle at which he was tied. Androl dropped his head back against the floor, closing his eyes. That didn’t prevent him from hearing poor Evin’s screams of terror. \"Androl?\" Pevara whispered. \"Quiet\". Mishraile’s voice was followed by a thump and a grunt from Pevara. I am really starting to hate that one, Pevara sent to him. Androl didn’t reply. They took the effort to dig us out of the collapsed room, Pevara continued. I remember some of it, before they shielded me and knocked me unconscious. It seems to have been less than a day since then. I guess Taim hasn’t yet hit his quota of Dread-lords Turned to the Shadow. She sent it, almost, with levity. Behind them, Evin’s screams stopped. Oh, Light! Pevara sent. Was that Evin? All wryness vanished from her tone. What’s happening? They’re Turning him, Androl sent back. Strength of will has something to do with resisting. That is why Logain hasn’t been Turned yet. Pevara’s concern was a warmth through the bond. Were all Aes Sedai like her? He’d assumed they had no emotions, but Pevara felt the full range—although she accompanied it with an almost inhuman control over how those emotions affected her. Another result of decades of practice? How do we escape? she sent. I’m trying to untie my bonds. My fingers are stiff. I can see the knot. It’s a hefty one, but I might be able to guide you. He nodded, and they began, Pevara describing the turns of the knot as Androl tried to twist his fingers around them. He failed to get enough purchase on the bonds; he tried pulling his hands free and wiggling them out, but the ropes were too tight. By the time he accepted defeat, his fingers were numb from the lack of circulation. It’s not going to work, he sent. I’ve been trying to push out of this shield, Pevara replied. It’s possible, and I think our shields might be tied off. Tied-off shields fail. Androl sent back agreement, though he couldn’t keep from feeling frustrated. How long could Evin hold out? The silence taunted him. Why couldn’t he hear any sounds? Then he sensed something. Channeling. Could that be thirteen men? Light. If there were thirteen Myrddraal as well, the situation was dire. What would they do if they escaped? They couldn’t fight so many. Which cliff did you choose? Pevara sent him. What? You said that when you were among the Sea Folk, they jumped off cliffs to prove their bravery. The higher the cliff, the braver the jumper. Which cliff did you choose? The highest, he admitted. Why? I figured that once you’ve decided to jump off a cliff, you might as well pick the highest one. Why accept the risk, if not for the greatest prize? Pevara sent back approval. We will escape, Androl. Somehow. He nodded, mostly for himself, and set back at his knot. A few moments later, Taim’s cronies returned. Evin squatted down beside Androl. Behind his eyes lurked something different, something awful. He smiled. \"Well, that was certainly not as bad as I had assumed it would be, Androl\". \"Oh, Evin . . \". \"Don’t worry about me\", Evin said, resting a hand on Androl’s shoulder. \"I feel great. No more fear, no more worry. We shouldn’t have been fighting all of this time. We are the Black Tower. We need to work together\". You are not my friend, Androl thought. You might have his face, but Evin . . . Oh, Light. Evin is dead. \"Where is Nalaam?\" Androl asked. \"Died in the cave-in, I’m afraid\". Evin shook his head. He leaned in. \"They’re planning to kill you, Androl, but I think I can convince them that you’re worth Turning instead. You’ll thank me, eventually\". The terrible thing inside of Evin’s eyes smiled, patted Androl on the shoulder, then rose and began chatting with Mezar and Welyn. Behind them, Androl could barely see thirteen shadows trailing over to grab Emarin and drag him away to be Turned next. Fades, with cloaks that did not move. Androl thought how lucky Nalaam was to be crushed in the collapse. CHAPTER 9 To Die Well Lan split the head of the Myrddraal in half down to the neck. He danced Mandarb back, letting the Fade thrash as it died, its convulsions twisting the pieces of its skull from the neck. Putrid black blood poured onto the rock, which had already been bloodied a dozen times. \"Lord Mandragoran!\" Lan wheeled toward the call. One of his men pointed back toward their camp, where a spout of bright red light was shooting into the air. Noon already? Lan thought, raising his sword and signaling for his Malkieri to retreat. The Kandori and Arafellin troops were swinging in, light cavalry with bows, sending wave after wave of arrows into the mass of Trollocs. The stench was tremendous. Lan and his men rode away from the front lines, passing two Asha’man and an Aes Sedai—Coladara, who had insisted on staying on as King Paitar’s advisor—channeling to set the Trolloc corpses aflame.
