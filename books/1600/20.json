Besides, it’s been years since I met anyone with a flair for magic who didn’t annoy me. That’s a tricky bit of necromancy with the hair and the butterflies, you know. I could teach you a few things.

Right there on the steps of Criminy’s wagon, watched only by a lone bludbunny and the cool cat’s grin of a moon, he kissed her. Her hands caught the smooth planes of his face for the first time, and she kissed him back gladly, feeling that finally she was in precisely the place she was meant to be. “Let’s dance, Mr. Murdoch,” she answered.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-mysterious-madam-morpho-blud-1/page-20.html","bookId":1600,"book":{"id":1600,"title":"The Mysterious Madam Morpho (Blud #1)","description":"Storyline: The Mysterious Madam Morpho (Blud #1.5) An elusive woman arrives at Criminy’s doorstep with a steamer trunk, begging for a position in the caravan to perform her unique new act.
