{"id":8486,"no":4,"title":"CHAPTER IV. ALONE IN THE WORLD.","content":"Joe Marks and Luke Robbins looked at each other in amazement. \"Your cabin entered!\" exclaimed Joe. \"What do you say to that, Luke?\" \"I did not know there were any thieves around here,\" answered Luke. \"What was taken?\" \"An old trunk was opened--I carelessly left it unlocked--and two five-dollar gold pieces were stolen out of it. At any rate I couldn\u0027t find them this morning.\" \"Two five-dollar gold pieces?\" said Joe quickly. \"Then I know who took them.\" \"What do you mean, Joe?\" said Luke. \"Out with it!\" \"You know that tramp who was here yesterday, Luke?\" \"Yes.\" \"He came round an hour ago, just after I had opened, and called for a glass of whisky. \u0027Where is your money?\u0027 I asked. \u0027I\u0027ve got plenty. You needn\u0027t be afraid,\u0027 he said. Then I called upon him to show it, and he pulled out a five-dollar gold piece. Of course I was surprised. \u0027Where did you get it?\u0027 I asked, suspiciously. \u0027Yesterday you said you had no money.\u0027 \u0027I had that,\u0027 he answered, \u0027but I didn\u0027t want to spend it. You see it was a gift from my dyin\u0027 mother, and I wanted to keep it for her sake.\u0027 With that he rolled up his eyes and looked sanctimonious. Then I asked him how it happened that he was ready to spend it now.\" \"What did he say?\" \"He said that he was so parched with thirst that he felt obliged to do it.\" \"Did you take his money?\" \"No. I was short of change. You see I changed a gold piece for the boy yesterday. Besides, I wasn\u0027t sure the piece was good, seeing who offered it. I thought it might be bogus.\" \"Then he didn\u0027t get his whisky?\" \"No. He went away disappointed. I don\u0027t doubt, Ernest, that the gold piece was one of yours. How did the fellow get in?\" \"Through the window. I found it open when I woke up.\" \"You must have slept sound?\" \"I did. I slept an hour later than I generally do.\" \"Was anything else taken?\" \"Not that I could discover.\" \"Do you mean to say that your uncle had but ten dollars?\" asked Joe incredulously. \"It was all he had in the trunk.\" \"I always thought him a rich man.\" \"He was not,\" said Ernest quietly. \"Was that all the money he had? He had the reputation of being a miser, with hoards of gold hidden in or near the cabin.\" \"I know of one sum of money he had concealed, but it was not a large amount. He told me about it before he died.\" \"I\u0027m glad you won\u0027t be left penniless, lad; did he own the cabin?\" \"Nobody owned it,\" said Joe Marks. \"It was built years ago by a man who suddenly left it and went away, nobody knew where. It wasn\u0027t worth much, and no one ever took the trouble to claim it. When your uncle came here he found it empty and took possession of it, and there he has lived ever since. So you\u0027ll have some money, Ernest?\" \"Only a hundred dollars.\" \"What will you do? What are your plans?\" \"I don\u0027t know. I haven\u0027t had time to think.\" \"I might find a place for you in the store. We wouldn\u0027t like to have you go away.\" \"Thank you, Joe. You are very kind. But there\u0027s no chance for me around here. I\u0027ll take the money, and go somewhere. But first I must see Uncle Peter buried. Will you help me?\" \"To be sure we will. Was he your only relation?\" \"He was not my relation at all.\" \"Why, you have always called him uncle.\" \"I supposed him to be my uncle, but yesterday he told me that he was only a servant in my father\u0027s family, and that on my father\u0027s death he was placed in charge of me.\" \"I reckon that\u0027s so. You didn\u0027t favor the old man at all. You look as if you came from better stock.\" \"All the same I shall miss him,\" said Ernest sadly. \"He was a good friend to me, Peter was.\" \"Did he tell you whether you had any kin?\" \"Yes; I have a cousin of my father\u0027s living in New York State. He is a rich man. He inherited the property that ought to have gone to my father.\" \"How did that happen?\" \"He prejudiced my grandfather against my father, and so the estate was willed to him.\" \"The mean scoundrel!\" exclaimed Luke indignantly. \"I\u0027d like to have him in my hands for a few minutes; I\u0027d give him a lesson.\" \"I should pity him if ever you got hold of him, Luke,\" said Joe Marks. \"But we must consider what we can do for the boy.\" \"I wish we could get hold of that thief of a tramp!\" \"Probably we shall. He\u0027ll find his way back here sooner or later.\" But the burial of Peter Brant was the first consideration. No undertaker was called, for in that small settlement one would not have been supported. The ceremonies of death were few and simple. A rude wooden box was put together, and Peter was placed in it, dressed as he was at the time of his death. There was an itinerant minister who preached in the village once in four weeks, but he was away now, and so there could be no religious ceremony beyond reading a chapter from the New Testament. Joe Marks, who had received a decent education, officiated as reader. Then the interment took place. In the forenoon of the second day Peter\u0027s body was laid away, and Ernest was left practically alone in the world. Meanwhile some account must be given of Tom Burns, the tramp. When he found it impossible to obtain whisky with the gold he had stolen, he felt very despondent. His throat was parched, and his craving became intolerable. He felt that he had been decidedly ill-used. What was the use of money unless it could be converted into what his soul desired? But there was no way of changing the coin except at the store of Joe Marks. To ask any of the villagers would only have excited surprise and suspicion. Besides, the tramp felt sure that Ernest would soon discover that he had been robbed. He would naturally be suspected, especially as Joe Marks had knowledge of a gold piece being in his possession. There was a small settlement about five miles off, called Daneboro. It was probably the nearest place where he could get a glass of whisky. He must walk there. It was not a pleasant prospect, for the tramp was lazy and not fond of walking, though he had been compelled to do a good deal of it. Still, it seemed to be a necessity, and when he left the store of Joe Marks he set out for Daneboro. Thirst was not the only trouble with Tom Burns. He had not eaten anything for about twenty-four hours, and his neglected stomach rebelled. He tightened a girdle about his waist, and walked on in great discomfort. He had perhaps gone two miles when he came to a cabin similar in appearance to that of old Peter Brant. A woman stood in the door-way. \"My good lady,\" said Tom, putting on a pitiful expression, \"I am a very unfortunate man.\" \"Are you?\" said the woman, scanning him critically. \"You look like a tramp.\" \"I do, madam, yet I was once a thriving merchant.\" \"You don\u0027t look like it.\" \"I don\u0027t; I acknowledge it.\" \"How did you lose your property, if you ever had any?\" \"By signin\u0027 notes for my brother. It swept off all my possessions.\" \"Then I pity you. That\u0027s the way my man lost five hundred dollars, nearly all he had. What can I do for you?\" \"Madam, I am hungry, very hungry.\" \"Set right down on the settle, and I\u0027ll give you what\u0027s left of our breakfast.\" Tom Burns obeyed with alacrity. A plate of cold bacon, a cold potato, and some corn bread were placed before him, and he ate them almost voraciously. There had been times in his life when he would have turned up his nose at such fare, but not now. \"My good lady,\" he said, \"you have saved my life.\" \"Well, you must \u0027a\u0027 been hungry,\" said the woman. \"A man that\u0027ll eat cold vittles, especially cold potato, ain\u0027t shammin\u0027.\" \"I wish I had money to offer you--\" \"Oh, never mind that, you\u0027re welcome. Can I do anything more for you?\" \"I feel sick, and sometimes, though I am a temperance man, I take whisky for my health. If you had just a sup--\" \"Well, we haven\u0027t, and if we had I wouldn\u0027t give you any.\" \"You misjudge me, madam. You must not think I am a drinker.\" \"It\u0027s no matter what I think. You can\u0027t get any whisky here.\" At Daneboro Tom fared better. He changed his gold piece, drank a pint of whisky, and the next day retraced his steps to old Peter\u0027s cabin. He felt satisfied that somewhere near the cabin there were treasures concealed, and he meant to secure them. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3012/83221.html","bookId":279,"book":{"id":279,"title":"The Young Bank Messenger","description":"简介： Just on the edge of the prairie, in western Iowa, some thirty years since, stood a cabin covering quite a little ground, but only one story high.
