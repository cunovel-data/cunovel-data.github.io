There was no way I could let Mr. Crepsley turn Sam into a half-vampire.\n I\u0027d thought about it a lot during the night, and the frightening thing was, I believed Sam would agree to become a half-vampire if I gave him the option. Smart as he was, I don\u0027t think he\u0027d have stopped to consider the loneliness and awfulness of being a vampire.\n He rushed over when he saw me, too excited to notice my new clothes and haircut.\n \"Did you ask him? Did you?\"His face was bright, filled with hope.\n \"Yes,\"I said, smiling sadly.\n \"And?\"\n I shook my head. \"Sorry, Sam. He said no.\"\n Sam\u0027s face fell about a thousand miles.\n \"Why ?\"he shouted.\n \"You\u0027re too young,\"I said.\n \"You\u0027re not much older!\"he snapped.\n \"But I don\u0027t have parents,\"I lied. \"I didn\u0027t have a home when I joined the Cirque.\"\n \"I don\u0027t care about my parents,\"he said with a sniff.\n \"That\u0027s not true,\"I said. \"You\u0027d miss them.\"\n \"I could go home for holidays.\"\n \"It wouldn\u0027t work. You\u0027re not cut out for life in the Cirque Du Freak. Maybe later, when you\u0027re older.\"\n \"I don\u0027t care about later !\"he yelled. \"I want to join now. I\u0027ve worked hard. I\u0027ve proved myself. I kept quiet when you were lying to R.V. about the wolf-man yesterday. Did you tell that to Mr. Tall?\"\n \"I told him everything,\"I said.\n \"I don\u0027t believe you,\"Sam said. \"I don\u0027t think you spoke to him at all. I want to see him myself.\"\n I shrugged and pointed toward Mr. Tall\u0027s van. \"That\u0027s where you\u0027ll find him,\"I said.\n Sam ran off in a huff but slowed after a few steps, then came to a halt. He kicked the ground miserably, then returned and sat down beside me.\n \"It\u0027s not fair,\"he grumbled. I could see tears trickling down his cheeks. \"I made up my mind to join. It was going to be great. I had it all planned.\"\n \"There\u0027ll be other chances,\"I said.\n \"When?\"he asked. \"I\u0027ve never heard of a freak show playing around here before. When will I run into one again?\"\n I didn\u0027t answer.\n \"You wouldn\u0027t have liked it, anyway,\"I said. \"It\u0027s not as much fun as you think. Imagine what it\u0027s like in the middle of winter, when you have to get up at five in the morning and shower in ice-cold water and work outside in blizzards.\"\n \"That doesn\u0027t bother me,\"Sam insisted. Then his tears stopped and he got a crafty look in his eyes. \"Maybe I\u0027ll come along, anyway,\"he said. \"Maybe I\u0027ll sneak into one of the vans and stow away with you. Mr. Tall would have to take me then.\"\n \"You can\u0027t do that!\"I snapped. \"No way!\"\n \"I will if I want.\"He grinned. \"You can\u0027t stop me.\"\n \"Yes, I can,\"I growled.\n \"How?\"He sneered.\n I took a deep breath. The time had come to scare Sam Grest away forever. I couldn\u0027t tell him the truth about me, but I could invent a story almost as horrifying, one guaranteed to send him running.\n \"I never told you what happened to my parents, did I, Sam? Or how I came to join the freak show?\"I kept my voice low and steady.\n \"No,\"Sam said quietly. \"I\u0027ve wondered a lot, but I didn\u0027t want to ask.\"\n \"I killed them, Sam,\"I said.\n \"What ?\"His face went white.\n \"I go crazy sometimes. Like the wolf-man. Nobody knows when it\u0027s going to happen, or why. I was in a hospital when I was younger, but I seemed to be getting better. My parents brought me home for Christmas. After dinner, while I was in a fight with Dad, I flipped out.\n \"I tore him to pieces. Mom tried to drag me off, but I killed her too. My little sister ran for help, but I caught her. I ripped her apart the same way I\u0027d ripped my mother and father.\n \"Then, after I\u0027d killed them...\"I locked eyes with Sam. It had to be a good act to make him believe. \"I ate them.\"\n He stared at me, stunned.\n \"That\u0027s not true,\"he whispered. \"It can\u0027t be.\"\n \"I killed and ate them, then ran away,\"I lied. \"I was discovered by Mr. Tall, who agreed to hide me. They have a special cage built to keep me in when I go crazy. The problem is, nobody knows when it\u0027s going to happen. That\u0027s why most people avoid me. Evra\u0027s okay, because he\u0027s strong. So are some of the other performers. But ordinary humans... I could rip them apart in a second.\"\n \"You\u0027re lying,\"Sam said.\n I picked up a large stick lying nearby, turned it around in my hands, then put it in my mouth and bit through it like it was a big carrot.\n \"I\u0027d chew your bones and spit you out as gristle,\"I told Sam. I\u0027d cut my lips on the stick and the blood made me look ferocious. \"You wouldn\u0027t be able to stop me. You\u0027d be sleeping in my tent if you joined the show and would be the one I\u0027d go for first.\n \"You can\u0027t join the Cirque Du Freak,\"I said. \"I wish you could - I\u0027d love to have a friend - but it\u0027s not possible. I\u0027d end up killing you if you joined.\"\n Sam tried responding but couldn\u0027t get his mouth to work. He believed my big lie. He\u0027d seen enough of the show to know that things like that could happen here.\n \"Go away, Sam,\"I said sadly. \"Go away and don\u0027t ever come back. It\u0027s safer that way. It\u0027s better. For both of us.\"\n \"Darren, I... I...\"He shook his head uncertainly.\n \"Go !\"I roared, and pounded the ground with my hands. I bared my teeth and growled. I was able to make my voice much deeper than a human\u0027s, so it sounded like a wild animal.\n Sam screamed, scrambled to his feet, and sprinted for the woods, never once looking back.\n I watched him go, heavyhearted, certain my ploy had worked. He\u0027d never be back. I wouldn\u0027t see him again. Our paths had separated, and we would never meet again.\n If I\u0027d known how wrong I was - if I\u0027d had any idea of the awful night that lay ahead - I\u0027d have run after him and never returned to that disgusting circus of blood, that revolting circus of death. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-s-assistant-the-saga-of-darren-shan-2/page-25.html","bookId":2438,"book":{"id":2438,"title":"The Vampire\u0027s Assistant (The Saga of Darren Shan #2)","description":"Storyline: \n The Saga of Darren Shan #2 : The Vampire\u0027s Assistant \n The story begins with the main protagonist of the last adventure, Darren Shan, and his guardian Larten Crepsley moving in for a drink of blood from an ex-scout.
