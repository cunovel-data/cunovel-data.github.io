He listened carefully, then said, \"You handled him well.\" \"I did what I had to,\"I replied. \"I\u0027m not proud of it. I don\u0027t like bullying or scaring people, but there was no other way.\" \"Actually, you should have killed him,\"Mr. Tall said. \"That way he could do us no harm whatsoever.\" \"I\u0027m not a murderer,\"I told him. \"I know.\"He sighed. \"Nor am I. It\u0027s a pity one of the Little People wasn\u0027t with you. They\u0027d have chopped his head off without a second\u0027s hesitation.\" \"What do you think we should do?\"I asked. \"I don\u0027t think he can cause many problems,\"Mr. Tall said. \"He\u0027ll probably be too scared to go to the police right away. Even if he does, there\u0027s no evidence against you. It would be an unwanted complication, but we\u0027ve had plenty of dealings with officers of the law in the past. We could cope.\" \"The health authorities worry me more. We could hit the road and lose them, but people in the health department tend to trail you around like hound dogs once they\u0027ve got your scent. \"We\u0027ll leave tomorrow,\"he decided. \"There\u0027s a show scheduled for tonight, and I hate canceling on short notice. Dawn is the earliest any health inspector could be here, so we\u0027ll make sure we\u0027re gone before then.\" \"You\u0027re not angry with me?\"I asked. \"No,\"he said. \"This isn\u0027t the first time we\u0027ve clashed with the public. You\u0027re not to blame.\" I helped Mr. Tall spread the word of our departure. Everybody took it in stride. Most seemed happy to be getting this much notice; a lot of times they had to move on with only an hour or two of warning. It was another busy day for me. As well as preparing for the show, I had to help people get ready for leaving. I offered to help Truska pack her stuff, but her tent was already bare when I got there. She only winked when I asked how she\u0027d packed so quickly. When Mr. Crepsley awoke I told him about our plan to leave. He didn\u0027t seem surprised. \"We have been here long enough,\"he said. I asked to be left out of that night\u0027s show, because I wasn\u0027t feeling very well. \"I\u0027ll get to bed early,\"I said, \"and get a good night\u0027s sleep.\" \"It will not do any good,\"Mr. Crepsley warned. \"There is only one thing that will make you feel better, and you know what it is.\" Night rolled on, and soon it was time for the show to begin. There was another big crowd. The roads were blocked with cars in both directions. Everybody in the Cirque was busy, either preparing to go onstage or getting people seated or selling stuff. The only two who seemed to have nothing to do were me and Evra, who wasn\u0027t performing because of his sick snake. He left her for a few minutes to watch the start of the show. We stood on one side of the stage as Mr. Tall got the ball rolling and introduced the wolf-man. We stuck around until the first break, then walked outside and studied the stars. \"I\u0027ll miss this place when we go,\"Evra said. \"I like the country. You can\u0027t see stars as well in the city.\" \"I didn\u0027t know you were interested in astronomy,\"I said. \"I\u0027m not,\"he replied. \"But I like looking up at the stars.\" I got dizzy after a while and had to sit down. \"You\u0027re not feeling too good, are you?\"Evra asked. I smiled weakly. \"I\u0027ve been better.\" \"Still not drinking human blood?\"I shook my head. He sat beside me. \"You\u0027ve never told me exactly why you won\u0027t drink it,\"he said. \"It can\u0027t be so different from animal blood, can it?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\"I said. \"And I don\u0027t want to find out.\"I paused. \"I\u0027m afraid that if I drink human blood, I\u0027ll be evil. Mr. Crepsley says vampires aren\u0027t evil, but I think they are. I think anyone who looks at humans as if they\u0027re animals must be evil.\" \"But if it keeps you alive...\"Evra said. \"That\u0027s how it would start,\"I said. \"I\u0027d tell myself I was doing it to keep going. I\u0027d swear never to drink more than I needed. But what if I couldn\u0027t stop myself? I\u0027ll need more as I grow older. What if I couldn\u0027t control my thirst? What if I killed someone?\" \"I don\u0027t think you could,\"Evra said. \"You\u0027re not evil, Darren. I don\u0027t think a good person can do evil things. As long as you treat human blood like medicine, you\u0027ll be all right.\" \"Maybe,\"I said, although I didn\u0027t believe it. \"Anyway, I\u0027m okay for now. I don\u0027t have to make a final decision for a couple more days.\" \"Would you really let yourself die rather than drink?\"Evra asked. \"I don\u0027t know,\"I answered honestly. \"I\u0027d miss you if you died,\"Evra said sadly. \"Well,\"I said uncomfortably, \"maybe it won\u0027t come to that. Maybe there\u0027s some other way I can survive, a way that Mr. Crepsley doesn\u0027t want to tell me about until he has no other choice.\" Evra grunted. He knew as well as I did that there was no other way. \"I\u0027m going to check on my snake,\"he said. \"Do you want to come and sit with us for a while?\" \"No,\"I said. \"I\u0027d better get some sleep. We have to get up early, and I\u0027m really tired.\" We said good night. I didn\u0027t head straight for Mr. Crepsley\u0027s van but wandered through the campsite, thinking about my conversation with Evra, wondering what it would feel like to die. I\u0027d ?died? once before, and been buried, but that wasn\u0027t the same thing. If I died for real, I\u0027d be dead for good. Life would be over, my body would decay, and then... I glanced up at the stars. Was that where I\u0027d be heading? To the other side of the universe? Vampire Paradise? It was a weird time. When I was living at home I\u0027d hardly ever thought about death; it was something that only happened to old people. Now here I was, almost face to face with it. If only somebody else could decide for me. I should be worrying about school and making the soccer team, not about whether I should drink human blood or let myself die. It wasn\u0027t fair. I was too young. I shouldn\u0027t have to - I saw a shadow passing the front of a nearby tent but didn\u0027t pay much attention. It wasn\u0027t until I heard a sharp snapping sound that I wondered who it might be. Nobody should have been out there. Everyone involved with the show was in the big tent. Was it somebody from the audience? I decided to investigate. I headed in the direction that the shadow had taken. It was a dark night, and after a few turns I couldn\u0027t figure out which way the person had gone. I was on the verge of abandoning the search when I heard another sharp snapping sound, closer this time. I looked around and knew immediately where the sounds must have come from: the wolf-man\u0027s cage ! Taking a deep breath to steady my nerves, I ran as fast as I could to check it out.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-s-assistant-the-saga-of-darren-shan-2/page-27.html","bookId":2438,"book":{"id":2438,"title":"The Vampire\u0027s Assistant (The Saga of Darren Shan #2)","description":"Storyline: The Saga of Darren Shan #2 : The Vampire\u0027s Assistant The story begins with the main protagonist of the last adventure, Darren Shan, and his guardian Larten Crepsley moving in for a drink of blood from an ex-scout.
