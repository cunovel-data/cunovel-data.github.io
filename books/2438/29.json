Sam, who wanted to join the Cirque. Sam, who asked to be my blood brother. Harmless, friendly, long-winded Sam. The boy who\u0027d saved my life. I didn\u0027t think about my own safety. Sam was in trouble, and there wasn\u0027t time to seek anyone else\u0027s help. It might be the death of me, but I had to go after them, to try to save Sam. I owed him. I got out of the camp quickly. The clouds had parted overhead and I spotted the wolf-man disappearing into the trees. I hurried after him, running as fast as I could. I heard the wolf-man howl a while later, which was a good sign. It meant he was still chasing Sam. If he\u0027d caught him, he\u0027d be too busy eating to howl. I wondered why he hadn\u0027t caught him yet. He should have. Although I\u0027d never seen him running in the open, I was sure he must be fast. Maybe he was playing with Sam, toying with him before he moved in for the kill. Their footprints were clear in the damp night earth, but I would have been able to follow from their sounds anyway. It\u0027s hard to run silently through a forest, especially at night. We ran in that way for a few minutes, Sam and the wolf-man way in front and out of sight, me trailing behind. My legs were beginning to get really tired, but I forced myself on. I thought about what I\u0027d do when I caught up. There was no way I could beat the wolf-man in a fair fight. I could smash him over the head with a stick or something, but probably not. He was strong and fast, and had the taste for human blood. He\u0027d be pretty much unstoppable. The most I could hope to do was throw myself in his path and take Sam\u0027s place. If I offered myself instead of Sam, maybe he\u0027d take me and Sam could escape. I wouldn\u0027t mind dying for Sam. I\u0027d given up my humanity for one friend; it wasn\u0027t asking so much more to give up my life for another. Besides, this way, if I died, it would be for a good cause. I wouldn\u0027t have to worry anymore about drinking human blood or starving to death. I could go down fighting. After a few more minutes, I ran into a clearing and realized where Sam had led us: the old deserted railroad station. It showed he was still thinking clearly. This was the best place to come, with plenty of hiding spots and lots of stuff - chunks of metal and glass - to use in a fight. Maybe neither of us would have to die. Maybe there was a chance we could win this battle. I saw the wolf-man pause in the middle of the station yard and sniff the air. He howled again, a loud spine-shivering howl, then sprinted toward one of the rusty train cars. I ran around the back of the car, moving as quietly as I could. I listened for sounds when I got there but couldn\u0027t hear anything. I lifted myself up and looked in one of the windows: nothing. I lowered myself and slid along to the third window over. I couldn\u0027t see anything when I looked inside again. I was lifting myself to peek in the next window, when I suddenly saw a metal bar moving toward my face at high speed. I twisted to my side just in time to avoid it. It whistled by my face, scratching me but not doing any serious damage. \"Sam, stop, it\u0027s me !\"I hissed, dropping to the ground. There was silence for a moment, then Sam\u0027s face appeared in the round window. \"Darren?\"he whispered. \"What are you doing here?\" \"I followed you,\"I said. \"I thought you were the wolf-man. I was trying to kill you.\" \"You practically did.\" \"I\u0027m sorry.\" \"For God\u0027s sake, Sam, don\u0027t waste time apologizing,\"I snapped. \"We\u0027re in big trouble. We\u0027ve got to think. Get out here quick.\" He backed away from the window. There were soft shuffling sounds, then he appeared outside the car door. He looked to make sure the wolf-man wasn\u0027t around, jumped down, and crept over to me. \"Where is he?\"Sam asked. \"I don\u0027t know,\"I whispered. \"He\u0027s around somewhere, though. I saw him coming in this direction.\" \"Maybe he found something else to attack.\"Sam whispered back hopefully. \"A sheep or a cow.\" \"I wouldn\u0027t bet on it,\"I said. \"He wouldn\u0027t have run all this way just to abandon the chase at the very end.\" We huddled close together, Sam covering the right with his eyes, me the left. I could feel his body trembling, and I\u0027m sure he could feel mine shaking, too. \"What are we going to do?\"Sam asked. \"I don\u0027t know,\"I whispered. \"Any ideas?\" \"A couple,\"he said. \"We could lead him into the guard\u0027s house. He might fall through the rotten floorboards. We could trap him down there.\" \"Maybe,\"I said. \"But what if we fall through, too? We\u0027d be trapped. He could jump down and eat us whenever he liked.\" \"How about the rafters?\"Sam asked. \"We could climb out into the middle of a rafter and hang on, back to back. We could take sticks with us and beat him off if he attacked. There\u0027d only be one way for him to come at us up there.\" \"And somebody\u0027s got to arrive from the Cirque Du Freak sooner or later,\"I whispered, thinking it over. \"But what if he decides to snap the rafter at one end?\" \"They\u0027re set pretty deeply into brick,\"Sam said. \"I don\u0027t think he could break them with his bare hands.\" \"Would a rafter hold the weight of three of us?\"I asked. \"I\u0027m not sure,\"Sam admitted. \"But at least if we fell from that height it\u0027d be over quickly. Who knows, we might get lucky and fall on the wolf-man. He could break our fall and get killed in the process.\" I laughed weakly. \"You watch too many cartoons. But that\u0027s a good idea. Better than any I can think of.\" \"How long do you think it\u0027ll be before the people from the Cirque get here?\"Sam whispered. \"Depends on when they realize what\u0027s happening,\"I said. \"If we\u0027re lucky, they\u0027ll have heard him howling and might be here in a couple of minutes. Otherwise we might have to wait until the end of the show, which could be another hour, maybe longer.\" \"Do you have a weapon?\"Sam asked. \"No,\"I said. \"I didn\u0027t have time to pick anything up.\" He handed me a short iron bar. \"Here,\"he said. \"I had this for backup. It\u0027s not very good, but it\u0027s better than nothing.\" \"Any sign of the wolf-man?\"I asked. \"No,\"he said. \"Not yet.\" \"We\u0027d better get going before he arrives,\"I whispered, then stopped. \"How are we going to go to the guard\u0027s house? It\u0027s a far hike, and the wolf-man could be hiding anywhere along the way.\" \"We\u0027ll have to run for it and hope for the best,\"Sam said. \"Should we split up?\"I asked. \"No,\"he said. \"I think we\u0027re better off together.\" \"Okay. Are you ready to start?\" \"Gimme a few seconds,\"he said. I turned and watched him breathing. His face was white, and his clothes were ripped and dirty from running through the woods, but he looked ready to fight. He was a tough little character. \"Why did you come back tonight, Sam?\"I whispered. \"To join the Cirque Du Freak,\"he answered. \"Even after everything I told you about me?\" \"I decided to risk it,\"he said. \"I mean, you\u0027re my friend. We have to stick by our friends, right? Your story made me want to join more, once I\u0027d recovered from being scared. Maybe I could have helped you. I\u0027ve read books about personality disorders. Maybe I could have cured you.\" I couldn\u0027t help smiling in the middle of this horrifying moment we were in. \"You\u0027re a moron, Sam Grest,\"I whispered. \"I know.\"He smiled. \"So are you. That\u0027s why we make a good team.\" \"If we get out of this,\"I told him, \"feel free to join. And you don\u0027t have to worry about me eating you. That was just a story to frighten you off.\" \"Really?\"he asked. \"Really,\"I said. \"Phew.\"He wiped his brow. \"I can rest easy now.\" \"You can if the wolf-man doesn\u0027t get you,\"I said with a grin. \"Ready yet?\" \"I\u0027m ready.\"He squeezed his palms and prepared to run. \"On the count of three,\"he whispered. \"Okay,\"I replied. \"One,\"he began. We faced in the direction of the guard\u0027s house. \"Two.\" We got in position to sprint. \"Thr-\" Before he could finish, a pair of hairy hands darted out from underneath the car, where - I realized too late - the wolf-man was hiding. The fingers wrapped around Sam\u0027s lower legs, grabbed him by the ankles, and dragged him down to the ground.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-s-assistant-the-saga-of-darren-shan-2/page-29.html","bookId":2438,"book":{"id":2438,"title":"The Vampire\u0027s Assistant (The Saga of Darren Shan #2)","description":"Storyline: The Saga of Darren Shan #2 : The Vampire\u0027s Assistant The story begins with the main protagonist of the last adventure, Darren Shan, and his guardian Larten Crepsley moving in for a drink of blood from an ex-scout.
