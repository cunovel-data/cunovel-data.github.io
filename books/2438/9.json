We grabbed buckets of water and scrubbed her down with really soft sponges.\\n\\n After that, we had to feed the wolf-man. His cage was near the back of the campsite. He roared when he saw us coming. He looked as angry and dangerous as he had that night I went to see the Cirque with Steve. He shook the bars and lunged at us if we got too close - which we didn\u0027t!\\n\\n \"Why is he so vicious?\"I asked, tossing him a large chunk of raw meat, which he grabbed in midair and bit into.\\n\\n \"Because he\u0027s a real wolf-man,\"Evra said. \"He\u0027s not just somebody very hairy. He\u0027s half human, half wolf.\"\\n\\n \"Isn\u0027t it cruel to keep him chained up?\"I asked, throwing him another slice of meat.\\n\\n \"If we didn\u0027t, he\u0027d run free and kill people. The mix of human and wolf blood has driven him mad. He wouldn\u0027t just kill when he was hungry; if he was free, he\u0027d murder all the time.\"\\n\\n \"Isn\u0027t there a cure?\"I asked, feeling sorry for him.\\n\\n \"There isn\u0027t a cure because it isn\u0027t a disease,\"Evra explained. \"This isn\u0027t something he caught, it\u0027s how he was born. This is what he is.\"\\n\\n \"How did it happen?\"I asked.\\n\\n Evra looked at me seriously. \"Do you really want to know?\"\\n\\n I stared at the hairy monster in the cage, ripping up the meat as if it were cotton candy, then gulped and said, \"No, I suppose I don\u0027t.\"\\n\\n We did a bunch of jobs after that. We peeled potatoes for the night\u0027s dinner, helped repair a tire on one of the cars, spent an hour painting the roof of a van, and walked a dog. Evra said most days were like this, just wandering through the camp, seeing what needed doing, helping out here and there.\\n\\n In the evening we took a garbage bag full of cans and broken pieces of glass to the tent of Rhamus Twobellies, a huge man who could eat anything. I wanted to stay and watch him eat, but Evra hurried me out. Rhamus didn\u0027t like people watching him eat when he wasn\u0027t performing.\\n\\n We had a lot of time to ourselves, and during our quieter moments we told each other about our lives - where we\u0027d come from and how we\u0027d grown up.\\n\\n Evra had been born to ordinary parents. They were horrified when they saw him. They abandoned him at an orphanage, where he stayed until an evil circus owner bought him at the age of four.\\n\\n \"Those were bad days,\"he said quietly. \"He used to beat me and treat me like a real snake. He kept me locked up in a glass case and let people pay to look at me and laugh.\"\\n\\n He was with the circus for seven long, miserable years, touring small towns, being made to feel ugly and freakish and useless.\\n\\n Finally, Mr. Tall came to the rescue.\\n\\n \"He showed up one night,\"Evra said. \"He appeared suddenly out of the darkness and stood by my cage for a long time, watching me. He didn\u0027t say a word. Neither did I.\\n\\n \"The circus owner came. He didn\u0027t know who Mr. Tall was, but thought he might be a rich man, interested in buying me. He gave him his price and stood back, waiting for an answer.\\n\\n \"Mr. Tall didn\u0027t say anything for a few minutes. Then his left hand grabbed the circus owner by the neck. He squeezed once and that was the end of him. He fell to the floor, dead. Mr. Tall opened the door to my cage and said, \u0027Let\u0027s go, Evra. I think Mr. Tali\u0027s able to read minds, which is how he knew my name.\"\\n\\n Evra was quiet after that. He had a faraway look in his eyes.\\n\\n \"Do you want to see something amazing?\"he finally said, snapping out of his thoughtful mood.\\n\\n \"Sure,\"I said.\\n\\n He turned to face me, then stuck out his tongue and pushed it up over his lip and right up his nose !\\n\\n \"Ewww! Gross!\"I yelled delightedly.\\n\\n He pulled the tongue back and grinned. \"I\u0027ve got the longest tongue in the world,\"he said. \"If my nose were big enough, I could poke my tongue all the way to the top, down my throat, and back out my mouth again.\"\\n\\n \"You couldn\u0027t!\"I laughed.\\n\\n \"Probably not.\"He giggled. \"But it\u0027s still pretty impressive.\"He stuck his tongue out again and this time licked around his nostrils, one after the other. It was revolting but hilarious.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the most disgusting thing I\u0027ve ever seen.\"I laughed.\\n\\n \"I bet you wish you could do it,\"Evra said.\\n\\n \"I wouldn\u0027t, even if I could,\"I lied. \"Don\u0027t you get snot all over your tongue?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t have any snot,\"Evra said.\\n\\n \"What? No snot?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s true,\"he said. \"My nose is different from yours. There\u0027s no snot or dirt or hairs. My nostrils are the cleanest part of my whole body.\"\\n\\n \"What does it taste like?\"I asked.\\n\\n \"Lick my snake\u0027s belly and you\u0027ll find out,\"he replied. \"It\u0027s the same taste as that.\"\\n\\n I laughed and said I wasn\u0027t that interested!\\n\\n Later, when Mr. Crepsley asked me what I\u0027d done all day, I told him: \"I made a friend.\"\\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-s-assistant-the-saga-of-darren-shan-2/page-9.html","bookId":2438,"book":{"id":2438,"title":"The Vampire\u0027s Assistant (The Saga of Darren Shan #2)","description":"Storyline: The Saga of Darren Shan #2 : The Vampire\u0027s Assistant \\n The story begins with the main protagonist of the last adventure, Darren Shan, and his guardian Larten Crepsley moving in for a drink of blood from an ex-scout.
