The fall knocked the breath out of him, silencing him momentarily, but after a second or two he was screaming again.\\n\\n I scrambled to my knees, grabbed Sam\u0027s arms, and pulled as hard as I could.\\n\\n I could see the wolf-man underneath the car, spread out on his hairy belly and grinning wildly. Drool was dripping from his jaws.\\n\\n I pulled with all my might, and Sam slid toward me. But the wolf-man came with him, wriggling out from under the car, not loosening his grip.\\n\\n I stopped pulling and let go of Sam. I grabbed the iron bar that he\u0027d dropped, jumped to my feet, and began pounding the outstretched arms of the wolf-man, who howled angrily.\\n\\n The wolf-man released one of his hairy paws and swatted at me. I ducked out of the way and struck at the hand still holding Sam. The wolf-man yelped with pain and his fingers came free.\\n\\n \"Run!\"I screamed to Sam as I yanked him to his feet.\\n\\n We sprinted toward the guard\u0027s house, side by side. I could hear the wolf-man scrambling out from beneath the car. He\u0027d been playing with us before, but now he was furious. I knew he\u0027d come at us with everything he had. The games were over. There was no way we\u0027d make it to the guard\u0027s house. He\u0027d have us before we were halfway across the yard.\\n\\n \"Keep... running,\"I gasped to Sam, then stopped momentarily and looked back to meet the charge of the oncoming wolf-man.\\n\\n My actions took him by surprise, and he ran into me. His body was hairy and sweaty and heavy. The collision sent both of us flying to the ground. Our arms and legs were all tangled up, but I quickly freed myself and whacked him with the iron bar.\\n\\n The wolf-man roared angrily and swiped at my arm. This time he connected, just below where it joined with my shoulder. The force of the blow deadened my arm, which became a useless lump of flesh and bone. I dropped the bar, then reached for it with my other hand.\\n\\n But the wolf-man was quicker. He snatched up the bar and tossed it far away, where it fell with a clang, lost to the darkness.\\n\\n He stood slowly, grinning nastily. I could read the expression in his eyes and knew, if he could speak, he would be saying something like: \"Now, Darren Shan, you\u0027re mine! You had your fun and games, but now it\u0027s killing time!\"\\n\\n He grabbed my body by the sides, opened his mouth wide, and leaned forward to bite my face off. I could smell the stench of his breath and see bits of meat and shirt from R.V.\u0027s arms stuck between his yellow teeth.\\n\\n Before he could snap his jaws shut, something hit the side of his head and knocked him off-balance.\\n\\n I could see Sam behind him, a heavy chunk of wood in his hands. He hit the wolf-man again, this time making his hands let go.\\n\\n \"One good turn deserves another!\"Sam screamed crazily, slamming the wood into the wolf-man for a third time. \"Come on! We have to -\"\\n\\n I never heard Sam\u0027s next words. Because as I started toward him, the wolf-man lashed out blindly with one of his fists. It was a wild shot, but he got lucky and it slammed into my face, knocking me backward.\\n\\n My head almost exploded. I saw bright lights and huge stars, then slumped to the ground, passed out.\\n\\n When I came to a few seconds or minutes later - I don\u0027t even know how much time had passed - the railroad station was eerily quiet. I couldn\u0027t hear anybody running or screaming or fighting. All I could hear was a steady munching sound, a little way ahead of me.\\n\\n Munch, munch, munch.\\n\\n I sat up slowly, ignoring the hammering pain in my head.\\n\\n It took my eyes a few seconds to readjust to the darkness. When I could see again, I realized I was gazing at the back of the wolf-man. He was crouched on all fours, head bent over something. He was the one making the munching sounds.\\n\\n The dizziness from the punch meant it took me a while to realize it wasn\u0027t a something he was eating... it was a someone.\\n\\n SAM!!!\\n\\n I scrambled to my feet, pain forgotten, and rushed forward, but one look at the bloody mess beneath the wolf-man and I knew I was too late.\\n\\n \"NO !\"I screamed and punched the wolf-man with my one good hand, attacking senselessly.\\n\\n He grunted and shoved me away. I sprang back and this time kicked as well as punched. He growled and tried shoving again, but I held on and pulled his hair and ears.\\n\\n He howled then and finally lifted his mouth. It was red, a dark, awful red, full of guts and blood and pieces of flesh and bone.\\n\\n He rolled on top of me, forcing me down, and pinned me with one long, hairy arm. His head shot back and he howled up at the night sky. Then, with a demonic snarl, he drove his teeth toward my throat, meaning to finish me off with one quick bite. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-s-assistant-the-saga-of-darren-shan-2/page-30.html","bookId":2438,"book":{"id":2438,"title":"The Vampire\u0027s Assistant (The Saga of Darren Shan #2)","description":"Storyline: The Saga of Darren Shan #2 : The Vampire\u0027s Assistant \\n The story begins with the main protagonist of the last adventure, Darren Shan, and his guardian Larten Crepsley moving in for a drink of blood from an ex-scout.
