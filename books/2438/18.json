A bunch of them were working on putting together the circus tent. I hadn\u0027t seen it before. It was an impressive sight when it was done, tall and round and red, decorated with pictures of the performers. Evra and me were kept busy, hammering pegs into the ground to hold the tent in place, arranging seats inside, setting up the stage for the show, preparing props for the performers (we had to find tin cans and nuts and bolts for Rhamus Twobellies to eat, and help move the wolf-man\u0027s cage inside the tent, and so on). It was a huge operation, but it moved with incredible speed. Everyone in the camp knew their place and what was expected of them, and there was never any real panic over the course of the day. Everybody worked as part of a team and things came together smoothly. Sam showed up early in the afternoon. I would have kept him around to help with the work, but Evra said he\u0027d be in the way, so we told him he had to take off. He was upset and slouched off, kicking an empty soda can along in front of him. I felt sorry for him, then realized how I could cheer him up. \"Sam! Wait a minute!\"I shouted. \"I\u0027ll be back in a second,\"I told Evra, then rushed off to Mr. Tall\u0027s van. I knocked once on the door and it opened instantly. Mr. Tall was standing inside, and before I could say a word, he held out two tickets for entry to the Cirque Du Freak. I stared at the tickets, then at Mr. Tall. \"How did you know...?\" \"I have my ways,\"he replied with a smile. \"I don\u0027t have any money,\"I warned him. \"I\u0027ll take it out of your wages,\"he said. I frowned. \"You don\u0027t pay me anything.\" His smile widened. \"Clever old me.\"He handed over the tickets and closed the door in my face before I could thank him. I hurried back to Sam and gave him the tickets. \"What are these?\"he asked. \"Tickets for tonight\u0027s show,\"I told him. \"One for you and one for R.V.\" \"Oh, wow!\"Sam quickly stuck the tickets in his pocket, as if he was afraid they might blow away or vanish. \"Thanks, Darren.\" \"No problem,\"I said. \"The only thing is, it\u0027s a late show. We\u0027re starting at eleven, and it won\u0027t be over till nearly one in the morning. Will you be able to come?\" \"Sure,\"Sam said. \"I\u0027ll sneak out. Mom and Dad go to bed at nine every night. They\u0027re early birds.\" \"If you get caught,\"I warned him, \"don\u0027t tell them where you\u0027re going.\" \"My lips are sealed,\"he promised, then set off to find R.V. Except for a quick dinner, there was no other break between then and the start of the show. While Evra left to feed his snake, I set up candles inside the circus tent. There were also five huge chandeliers to be hung, four above the crowd and one over the stage, but the Little People took care of those. Mags - a pretty woman who sold souvenirs and candy during intermission - asked me to help her get the displays ready, so I spent an hour stacking candy spiderwebs and edible ?glass? statues and pieces of the wolf-man\u0027s hair. There was a new novelty I hadn\u0027t seen before: a small model of Cormac Limbs. When you cut a part of it off, a new piece grew in its place. I asked Mags how it worked but she didn\u0027t know. \"It\u0027s one of Mr. Tall\u0027s inventions,\"she said. \"He makes a lot of this stuff himself.\" I chopped the head off the model and tried peering down the neck to see what was inside, but a new head grew before I could. \"The models don\u0027t last forever,\"Mags said. \"They rot after a few months.\" \"Do you tell people that when they\u0027re buying them?\"I asked. \"Of course,\"she said. \"Mr. Tall insists we let the customers know exactly what they\u0027re buying. He doesn\u0027t approve of conning people.\" Mr. Crepsley summoned me half an hour before the show began. He was dressing in his stage costume when I entered. \"Polish Madam Octa\u0027s cage,\"he ordered, \"then brush your suit down and clean yourself up.\" \"Why?\"I asked. \"You are going on with me,\"he said. My eyes lit up. \"You mean I\u0027m part of the act?\"I gasped. \"A small part,\"he said. \"You can bring the cage on and play the flute when it is Madam Octa\u0027s time to spin a web over my mouth.\" \"Mr. Tall normally does that, doesn\u0027t he?\" \"Normally,\"Mr. Crepsley agreed, \"but we are short on performers tonight, so he is going to be performing himself. Besides, you are better suited to assisting than him.\" \"How so?\"I asked. \"You look creepier,\"he said. \"With your pale face and that awful suit, you look like something out of a horror film.\" That gave me a little bit of a shock. I\u0027d never thought I was creepy looking! I looked in a mirror and realized I did look sort of frightening. Because I hadn\u0027t drank human blood, I was a lot paler than I should have been. The dirty suit made me look even more ghostlike. I made up my mind to find something new to wear in the morning. The show started at exactly eleven. I didn\u0027t expect much of a crowd - we were in the middle of nowhere and hadn\u0027t had much time to notify people about the show - but the tent was packed. \"Where did they all come from?\"I whispered to Evra as we watched Mr. Tall introduce the wolf-man. \"Everywhere,\"he replied quietly. \"People always know when one of our shows is happening. Besides, even though he only told us about it today, Mr. Tall probably knew we\u0027d be playing tonight ever since we set up camp.\" I watched the show from the wings, enjoying it even more than the first time I\u0027d seen it, because now I knew the people involved and felt like part of the family. Hans Hands went on after the wolf-man, followed by Rhamus Twobellies. We had our first break, then Mr. Tall went onstage and darted around the place, never seeming to move, just vanishing from one spot and appearing somewhere new. Next up was Truska, then it was my turn to go onstage with Mr. Crepsley and Madam Octa. The lights were low, but my vampire vision helped me pick out Sam\u0027s and R.V.\u0027s faces in the crowd. They were surprised to see me and clapped louder than anybody else. I had to hide my excited smile: Mr. Crepsley had told me to look miserable and glum, to impress the crowd. I stood over on one side as Mr. Crepsley made a speech about how deadly Madam Octa was, then opened the door to her cage as an assistant led a goat on the stage. There was a loud, angry gasp when Madam Octa killed the goat... it came from R.V. I knew then that I shouldn\u0027t have invited him - I\u0027d forgotten how fond he was of animals - but it was too late to take back my invitation. I was pretty nervous when it was my turn to play the flute and control Madam Octa, feeling every set of eyes in the tent focus on me. I\u0027d never performed for a crowd before and for a few seconds I was afraid my lips wouldn\u0027t work or I\u0027d forget the tune. But once I started blowing and sending my thoughts to Madam Octa, I did okay. As she weaved her web across Mr. Crepsley\u0027s lips, it struck me that I could get rid of him now if I wanted. I could make her bite him. The idea shocked me. I\u0027d thought about killing him before, but never seriously, and not since we\u0027d joined the Cirque. Now here he was, his life in my hands. All it would take was one \"slip.\"I could say it was an accident. Nobody would be able to prove otherwise. I watched the spider move back and forth, up and down, her poisonous fangs glinting under the lights of the chandelier. The heat from the candles was intense. I was sweating a lot. It occurred to me that I could blame the slip of my fingers on the sweat. Over his mouth she spun her web. His hands were down by his sides. He wouldn\u0027t be able to stop her. One wrong toot on the flute was all it would take. One broken note to stop the train of thought between the two of us, and... I didn\u0027t do it. I played perfectly and safely. I wasn\u0027t sure why I spared the vampire. Maybe because Mr. Tall might know I\u0027d killed him. Maybe because I needed Mr. Crepsley to teach me how to survive. Maybe because I didn\u0027t want to become a killer. Or maybe, just maybe, because I was starting to like the vampire. After all, he\u0027d brought me to the Cirque and made me part of his act. I wouldn\u0027t have met Evra and Sam if it hadn\u0027t been for him. He\u0027d been kind to me, as kind as he could be. Whatever the reason, I didn\u0027t let Madam Octa kill her master, and at the end of the act we took our bows and exited together. \"You thought about killing me,\"Mr. Crepsley said softly once we were backstage. \"What do you mean?\"I played dumb. \"You know what I mean,\"he said. There was a pause. \"It would not have worked. I milked most of the poison from her fangs before we went on. Killing the goat took the rest out of her.\" \"It was a test?\"I stared at him, and my hatred grew again. \"I thought you were being nice to me!\"I cried. \"And all the time it was just a test!\" His face was serious. \"I had to know,\"he said. \"I had to know if I could rely on you.\" \"Well, listen to this,\"I growled, standing on my toes so I could go eyeball to eyeball with him. \"Your test was useless. I didn\u0027t kill you this time, but if I ever get the chance again, I\u0027ll take it!\" I stormed off without another word, too upset to stick around to see Cormac Limbs or the end of the show, feeling betrayed, even though deep down I knew what he said made sense.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-s-assistant-the-saga-of-darren-shan-2/page-18.html","bookId":2438,"book":{"id":2438,"title":"The Vampire\u0027s Assistant (The Saga of Darren Shan #2)","description":"Storyline: The Saga of Darren Shan #2 : The Vampire\u0027s Assistant The story begins with the main protagonist of the last adventure, Darren Shan, and his guardian Larten Crepsley moving in for a drink of blood from an ex-scout.
