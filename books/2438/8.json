He immediately rocked back in the hammock and raised the covers, as though to protect himself. Then he saw the snake wrapped around me and breathed easily.\n \"Who are you?\"he asked sharply. \"What are you doing here?\"\n I shook my head slowly. I didn\u0027t dare speak for fear that the movement of my lungs would cause the snake to strike.\n \"You\u0027d better answer,\"he warned, \"or I\u0027ll tell her to take your eyes out.\"\n \"I... I... I\u0027m Duh-Darren Sh-sh-Shan,\"I stuttered. \"Mr. Tuh-Tall told me to cuh-come in. He said I wuh-wuh-was supposed to be your new ruh-ruh-ruh-roommate.\"\n \"Darren Shan?\"The snake-boy frowned, then pointed knowingly. \"You\u0027re Mr. Crepsley\u0027s assistant, aren\u0027t you?\"\n \"Yes,\"I said quietly.\n The snake-boy grinned. \"Did he know Mr. Tall was putting you in with me?\"I nodded and he laughed. \"I\u0027ve never met a vampire without a nasty sense of humor.\"\n He swung down out of the hammock, crossed the tent, took hold of the snake\u0027s head, and began unwrapping it. \"You\u0027re okay,\"he assured me. \"In fact, you were never in danger. The snake\u0027s been asleep the whole time. You could have tugged her off and she wouldn\u0027t have stirred. She\u0027s a deep sleeper.\"\n \"She\u0027s asleep ?\"I squeaked. \"But... how come she wrapped herself around me?\"\n He smiled. \"She sleepcrawls.\"\n \"Sleepcrawls !\"I stared at him, then at the snake, which hadn\u0027t moved while he was unwinding her. The last of her coils came free and I could step away to one side. My legs were stiff and full of pins and needles.\n \"A sleepcrawling snake.\"I laughed uneasily. \"Thank God she\u0027s not a sleepeating snake!\"\n The snake-boy tucked his pet away in a corner and stroked her head lovingly. \"She wouldn\u0027t have eaten you even if she had woken up,\"he informed me. \"She ate a goat yesterday. Snakes her size don\u0027t have to eat very often.\"\n Leaving his snake, he threw back the tent flap and stepped out. I followed quickly, not wanting to be left alone with the reptile.\n I studied him closely outside. He was exactly as I remembered: a few years older than me and very thin, with long yellow-green hair, narrow eyes, and strangely webbed fingers and toes; his body was covered in green, gold, yellow, and blue scales. He was wearing a pair of shorts and nothing else.\n \"By the way,\"he said, \"my name\u0027s Evra Von.\"He held out a hand and we shook. His palm felt slippery, but dry. A few of the scales came off and stuck to my hand when I pulled it away. They were like scraps of colored dead skin.\n \"Evra Von what?\"I asked.\n \"Just plain Von,\"he said, rubbing his stomach. \"You hungry?\"\n \"Yes,\"I said, and went with Evra to get something to eat.\n The camp was alive with activity. Since there had been no show the night before, most of the freaks and their helpers had gone to bed early, and so now they were up and about earlier than usual.\n I was fascinated by the hustle and bustle. I hadn\u0027t realized there were so many people working for the Cirque. I\u0027d thought it would just be the performers and assistants I\u0027d seen the night I went to the show with Steve, but as I looked around I saw that those were just the tip of the iceberg. There were at least two dozen people walking or talking, washing or cooking, none of whom I\u0027d seen before.\n \"Who are all these?\"I asked.\n \"The backbone of the Cirque Du Freak,\"Evra replied. \"They do the driving, set up the tents, do the laundry and the cooking, fix our costumes, clean up after shows. It\u0027s a big operation.\"\n \"Are they normal humans?\"I asked.\n \"Most of them,\"he said.\n \"How did they come to work here?\"\n \"Some are related to the performers. Some are friends of Mr. Tall. Some just wandered in, liked what they saw, and stayed.\"\n \"People can do that?\"I asked.\n \"If Mr. Tall likes the look of them,\"Evra said. \"There are always openings at the Cirque Du Freak.\"\n Evra stopped at a large campfire, and I stopped beside him. Hans Hands (a man who could walk on his hands and run faster on them than the world\u0027s fastest sprinter) was resting on a log, while Truska (the bearded lady, who grew her beard whenever she wanted) cooked sausages on a wooden stick. Several humans were sitting or lying around.\n \"Good morning, Evra Von,\"Hans Hands said.\n \"How are you, Hans?\"Evra replied.\n \"Who\u0027s your young friend?\"Hans asked, eyeing me suspiciously.\n \"This is Darren Shan,\"Evra said.\n \"The Darren Shan?\"Hans asked, eyebrows raising.\n \"None other.\"Evra grinned.\n \"What do you mean, The Darren Shan\u0027?\"I asked.\n \"You\u0027re famous in these parts,\"Hans said.\n \"Why? Because I\u0027m a\"- I lowered my voice - \"half-vampire?\"\n Hans laughed pleasantly. \"Half-vampires are nothing new. If I had a silver dollar for every half-vampire I\u0027d seen, I\u0027d have...\"He scrunched up his face and thought. \"Twenty-nine silver dollars. But young half-vampires are a different story. I never saw or heard of a guy your age living it up among the ranks of the walking dead. Tell me: Have the Vampire Generals been around to inspect you yet?\"\n \"Who are the Vampire Generals?\"I asked.\n \"They\u0027re -\"\n \"Hans!\"a lady washing clothes barked. He stopped speaking and looked around guiltily. \"Do you think Larten would enjoy hearing you spreading tales?\"she snapped.\n Hans made a face. \"Sorry,\"he said. \"It\u0027s the morning air. I\u0027m not used to it. It makes me say things I shouldn\u0027t.\"\n I wanted him to explain about the Vampire Generals, but I guess it would have been impolite to ask.\n Truska checked the sausages, pulled a couple off the stick, and handed them out. She smiled when she came to me, and said something in a strange, foreign language.\n Evra laughed. \"She wants to know if you like sausages or if you\u0027re a vegetarian.\"\n \"That\u0027s a good one!\"Hans chuckled. \"A vampire vegetarian!\"\n \"You speak her language?\"I asked Evra.\n \"Yes,\"he said proudly. \"I\u0027m still learning - it\u0027s the hardest language I\u0027ve ever tried to learn - but I\u0027m the only one in the camp who knows what she\u0027s saying. I\u0027m excellent at languages,\"he bragged.\n \"What language is it?\"I asked.\n \"I don\u0027t know,\"he said, frowning. \"She won\u0027t tell me.\"\n That sounded weird, but I didn\u0027t want to say anything to offend him. Instead, I took one of the sausages and smiled thanks. I bit into it and had to drop it immediately; it was piping hot! Evra laughed and handed me a glass of water. I drank until my mouth was back to normal, then blew on the sausage to cool it down.\n We sat with Hans and Truska and the others for a while, chatting and eating and soaking up the morning sun. The grass was wet with dew, but none of us minded. Evra introduced me to everyone in the group. There were too many names for me to remember at once, so I just smiled and shook hands.\n Mr. Tall soon appeared. One minute he wasn\u0027t there, the next he was standing behind Evra, warming his hands over the fire.\n \"You\u0027re up early, Master Shan,\"Mr. Tall remarked.\n \"I couldn\u0027t sleep,\"I told him. \"I was too - \"I looked over at Evra and smiled \"- wound-up.\"\n \"I hope it will not affect your ability to work,\"Mr. Tall said.\n \"I\u0027ll be fine,\"I said. \"I\u0027m ready to work.\"\n \"You\u0027re sure?\"\n \"I\u0027m sure.\"\n \"That\u0027s what I like to hear.\"He pulled out a large notebook and flipped through the pages. \"Let\u0027s see what we can find for you to do today,\"he said. \"Tell me: Are you a good cook?\"\n \"I can cook stew. Mr. Crepsley taught me.\"\n \"Have you ever cooked for thirty or forty humans?\"\n \"No.\"\n \"Too bad. Maybe you\u0027ll learn.\"He flipped through another couple of pages. \"Can you sew?\"\n \"No.\"\n \"Have you washed clothes before?\"\n \"By hand?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"No.\"\n \"Hmmm.\"He flipped some more, then snapped the book shut. \"Okay,\"he said, \"until we find a more permanent position for you, stick with Evra and help him with his chores. Does that sound fair?\"\n \"I\u0027d like that,\"I said.\n \"You don\u0027t mind, Evra?\"he asked the snake-boy.\n \"Not at all,\"Evra replied.\n \"Very well. It\u0027s settled. Evra will be in charge of you until further notice. Do what he says. When your colleague-in-blood arises,\"- he meant Mr. Crepsley - \"you\u0027re free to spend the night with him if he so desires. We\u0027ll see how you do, then make a decision on how best to utilize your talents.\"\n \"Thank you,\"I said.\n \"My pleasure,\"he replied.\n I expected him to suddenly vanish then, but instead he turned and walked away slowly, whistling, enjoying the sunshine.\n \"Well, Darren,\"Evra said, sticking a scaly arm around my shoulders, \"looks like you and I are partners now. How do you feel about that?\"\n \"I feel good... partner.\"\n \"Cool!\"He slapped my shoulder and gulped down the last of his sausage. \"Then let\u0027s get going.\"\n \"What do we do first?\"I asked.\n \"What we\u0027ll be doing first every morning,\"Evra said. \"Milking the poison from the fangs of my snake.\"\n \"Oh,\"I said. \"Is it dangerous?\"\n \"Only if she bites before we finish,\"Evra said, then laughed at my expression and pushed me ahead of him to the tent. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-s-assistant-the-saga-of-darren-shan-2/page-8.html","bookId":2438,"book":{"id":2438,"title":"The Vampire\u0027s Assistant (The Saga of Darren Shan #2)","description":"Storyline: \n The Saga of Darren Shan #2 : The Vampire\u0027s Assistant \n The story begins with the main protagonist of the last adventure, Darren Shan, and his guardian Larten Crepsley moving in for a drink of blood from an ex-scout.
