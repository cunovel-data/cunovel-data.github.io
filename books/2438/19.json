{"id":79002,"no":19,"title":"Page 19","content":"I was still upset the next morning. Evra kept asking me what was wrong, but I wouldn\u0027t tell him. I didn\u0027t want him to know I\u0027d been thinking of killing Mr. Crepsley. Evra told me he\u0027d met Sam and R.V. after the show. \"Sam loved it,\"Evra said, \"especially Cormac Limbs. You should have stayed to see Cormac in action. When he sawed his legs off...\" \"I\u0027ll see him next time,\"I said. \"How did R.V. take it?\" Evra frowned. \"He wasn\u0027t happy.\" \"Upset about the goat?\"I asked. \"Yeah,\"Evra said, \"but not just that. I said we bought the goat from a butcher, so it would have been killed anyway. It was the wolf-man, the snake, and Mr. Crepsley\u0027s spider that bothered him the most.\" \"What was wrong with them ?\"I asked. \"He was afraid they weren\u0027t being treated right. He didn\u0027t like the idea of them being locked in cages. I told him they weren\u0027t, except for the spider. I said the wolf-man was really quiet offstage. And I showed him my snake and how she slept with me.\" \"Did he believe you about the wolf-man?\"I asked. \"I think so,\"Evra said, \"although he still seemed suspicious when they were leaving. And he was very interested in their eating habits. He wanted to know what we fed them, how often, and where we got the food. We have to be careful with R.V. He could cause problems. Luckily, he should be leaving in a day or two, but until then, beware.\" The day went by quietly. Sam didn\u0027t show up until later on in the afternoon, and none of us was in the mood for playing. It was a cloudy day, and we were all a little out of sorts. Sam only stayed for half an hour, then went home again. Mr. Crepsley summoned me to his van a little after sunset. I wasn\u0027t going to go, but decided it was best not to annoy him too much. He was my guardian, after all, and could probably have me booted out of the Cirque Du Freak. \"What do you want?\"I snapped when I arrived. \"Stand over here, where I can see you better,\"the vampire said. He tilted my head backward with his bony fingers and rolled up my eyelids to check the whites of my eyes. He told me to open my mouth and peered down my throat. Then he checked my pulse and reflexes. \"How do you feel?\"he asked. \"Tired,\"I said. \"Weak?\"he asked. \"Sick?\" \"A bit.\" He grunted. \"Have you been drinking much blood lately?\"he asked. \"As much as I\u0027m supposed to,\"I said. \"But no human blood?\" \"No,\"I said softly. \"Okay,\"he said. \"Get ready. We are going out.\" \"Hunting?\"I asked. He shook his head. \"To see a friend.\" I got up on his back outside the van, and he began running. When we were far enough away from the camp, he flitted and the world blurred around us. I didn\u0027t really pay attention to where we were going. I was more concerned with my suit. I\u0027d forgotten to get new clothes, and now, the more I examined it, the worse the suit seemed. There were dozens of small holes and rips, and the color was a lot grayer than it was supposed to be, because of the dirt and dust. Strands of thread and fibers had come loose, and every time I shook an arm or a leg I looked like I was shedding hairs. I\u0027d never been very worried about clothes, but I didn\u0027t want to look like a bum. Tomorrow I\u0027d definitely find something new to wear. After a while we approached a city and Mr. Crepsley slowed down. He stopped outside the back of a tall building. I wanted to ask where we were, but he put a finger to his lips and made the sign for silence. The back door was locked but Mr. Crepsley laid a hand over it and clicked the fingers of his other hand. It opened instantly. He led the way through a long, dark corridor, then up a set of stairs and into a brightly lit hallway. After a few minutes, we came to a white desk. Mr. Crepsley looked around to make sure we were alone, then rang the bell that hung from one of the walls. A figure appeared behind the glass wall on the other side of the desk. The door in the glass wall opened and a brown-haired man in a white uniform and green mask stepped through. He looked like a doctor. \"How may I -,\"he began, then stopped. \"Larten Crepsley! What are you doing here, you old devil?\" The man pulled down his mask, and I saw he was grinning. \"Hello, Jimmy,\"Mr. Crepsley said. The two shook hands and smiled at each other. \"Long time no see.\" \"Not as long as I thought it would be,\"the man called Jimmy said. \"I heard you\u0027d been killed. An old enemy finally rammed a stake through your rotten heart, or so the story went.\" \"You should not believe everything you hear,\"Mr. Crepsley said. He put a hand on my shoulder and nudged me forward. \"Jimmy, this is Darren Shan, a traveling companion of mine. Darren, this is Jimmy Ovo, an old friend and the world\u0027s finest pathologist.\" \"Hello,\"I said. \"Pleased to meet you,\"Jimmy said, shaking my hand. \"You aren\u0027t a... I mean, do you belong to the club ?\" \"He is a vampire,\"Mr. Crepsley said. \"Only half of me,\"I snapped. \"I\u0027m not a full vampire.\" \"Please,\"Jimmy winced. \"Don\u0027t use that word. I know what you guys are, and I\u0027m fine with it, but that \u0027V\u0027 word never fails to freak me out.\"He shivered playfully. \"I think it\u0027s because of all the horror movies I watched when I was a kid. I know you\u0027re not like those movie monsters, but it\u0027s hard to get the image out of my mind.\" \"What\u0027s a pathologist do?\"I asked. \"I cut corpses open to see how they died,\"Jimmy explained. \"I don\u0027t do it with a lot of bodies - just the ones who died in suspicious circumstances.\" \"This is a city morgue,\"Mr. Crepsley said. \"They store bodies that arrive dead at the hospital or die while they\u0027re there.\" \"Is that where you keep them?\"I asked Jimmy, pointing at the room behind the glass wall. \"Yup,\"he said cheerfully. He swung up a section of the desk and invited us through. I was nervous. I expected to see dozens of tables piled high with sliced-open bodies. But it wasn\u0027t like that. There was one dead body, covered from head to toe with a long sheet, but that was the only one I could see. Otherwise it was a huge, well-lit room, with big filing cabinets built in the walls and lots of medical equipment scattered around the place. \"How is business?\"Mr. Crepsley asked as we sat on three chairs near the corpse on the table. Jimmy and Mr. Crepsley didn\u0027t pay attention to the dead person, and since I didn\u0027t want to look out of place, neither did I. \"Slow enough,\"Jimmy answered. \"The weather\u0027s been good, and there haven\u0027t been many car accidents. No strange diseases, no food epidemics, no collapsing buildings. By the way,\"he added, \"I had an old friend of yours in here a few years back.\" \"Oh?\"Mr. Crepsley responded politely. \"Who was that?\" Jimmy sniffed heavily through his nose, then cleared his throat. \"Gavner Purl ?\"Mr. Crepsley hooted with delight. \"How is the old dog - as clumsy as ever?\" They started talking about their friend Gavner Purl. I looked around while they were speaking, wondering where the bodies were kept. Finally, when they paused for breath, I asked Jimmy. He stood up, and told me to follow. He led the way to the big filing cabinets and pulled one of the drawers out. There was a hissing sound, and a cloud of cold air rose from inside the drawer. When it cleared, I saw a sheet-covered form and realized the filing cabinets weren\u0027t filing cabinets at all. They were refrigerated coffins! \"We store the bodies here until we\u0027re ready.\" Jimmy said, \"or until their next of kin come to collect them.\" I looked around the room, counting the rows of drawer doors. \"Is there a body behind each of these?\"I asked. Jimmy shook his head. \"We\u0027ve only got six guests right now, not counting the one on the table. Like I said, it\u0027s quiet. And even during our busiest times, most of our storage space goes unused. It\u0027s rare for us to be half full. We just like to be prepared for the worst.\" \"Any fresh bodies in stock?\"Mr. Crepsley asked. \"Wait a minute and I\u0027ll check,\"Jimmy said. He consulted a large pad and flicked through a few pages. \"There\u0027s a man in his thirties,\"Jimmy said. \"Died in a car crash just over eight hours ago.\" \"Nothing fresher?\"Mr. Crepsley asked. \"Afraid not,\"Jimmy replied. Mr. Crepsley sighed. \"It will have to do.\" \"Wait a minute,\"I said. \"You\u0027re not going to drink from a dead person, are you?\" \"No,\"Mr. Crepsley said. He reached inside his cape and pulled out some of the small bottles where he stored his supply of human blood. \"I have come for a refill.\" \"You can\u0027t!\"I yelled. \"Why not?\"he asked. \"It isn\u0027t right. It\u0027s not fair to drink from the dead. Besides, the blood will have turned sour.\" \"It will not be at its best,\"Mr. Crepsley agreed, \"but it will do for bottling. And I disagree: A corpse is the ideal person to drain, since it has no use for the blood. It will take a lot to fill these bottles. Too much to take from a living person.\" \"Not if you took a little from several,\"I protested. \"True,\"he said. \"But that would require time, effort, and risk. It is easier this way.\" \"Darren doesn\u0027t speak like a vampire,\"Jimmy remarked. \"He is still learning.\"Mr. Crepsley grunted. \"Now, lead the way to the body, please. We have not got all night.\" I knew it would be pointless to argue anymore, so I shut my mouth and followed silently behind them. Jimmy slid out the body of a tall blond man and whipped back the sheet. There was a nasty bruise on the dead man\u0027s head and his body was really white, but otherwise he looked like he might be sleeping. Mr. Crepsley made a long, deep cut across the man\u0027s chest, baring his heart. He arranged the bottles beside the corpse, then got out a tube and stuck one end into the first of the bottles. He stuck the other end into the dead man\u0027s heart, then wrapped his fist around the organ and squeezed it like a pump. Blood crept slowly along the tube and into the bottle. When it was almost full, Mr. Crepsley pulled the tube out and jammed a cork into the neck of the bottle. He stuck the mouth of the tube into the second bottle and started filling that one. Raising the first bottle, he swallowed a mouthful and rolled it around his gums, as though tasting wine. \"Good,\"he grunted, licking his lips. \"It is pure. We can use it.\" He filled eight bottles, then turned to me with a serious look on his face. \"Darren,\"he said, \"I know you are reluctant to drink human blood, but it is time you got over your fear.\" \"No,\"I said immediately. \"Come now, Darren,\"he growled. \"This person is dead. His blood is no good to him anymore.\" \"I can\u0027t,\"I said. \"Not from a corpse.\" \"But you will not drink from a live person!\"Mr. Crepsley exploded. \"You will have to drink human blood eventually. This is the best way to start.\" \"Um, listen, guys,\"Jimmy said. \"If you\u0027re going to feed, I think I should get out of -\" \"Quiet!\"Mr. Crepsley snapped. His eyes were burning into me. \"You have to drink,\"he said firmly. \"You are a vampire\u0027s assistant. It is time you behaved like one.\" \"Not tonight,\"I begged. \"Another time. When we go hunting. From a living person. I can\u0027t drink from a corpse. It\u0027s disgusting.\" Mr. Crepsley sighed and shook his head. \"One night you will realize how silly you are being,\"he said. \"I just hope, by that time, you are not beyond being saved.\" Mr. Crepsley thanked Jimmy Ovo for his help, and the two started talking about the past and their friends. I sat by myself while they chatted, feeling miserable, wondering how long I could go without human blood. When they were finished, we walked downstairs. Jimmy came with us and waved good-bye. He was a nice guy and I was sorry we\u0027d had to meet under dark circumstances. Mr. Crepsley didn\u0027t say anything the whole way home, and when we arrived back at the Cirque Du Freak, he tossed me angrily to one side and pointed a finger at me. \"If you die,\"he said, \"it is not my fault.\" \"Okay,\"I replied. \"Stupid boy,\"he grumbled, then stormed off to his coffin. I stayed up a while longer and watched the sun rising. I thought a lot about my situation and what would happen when my strength faded and I began to die. A half-vampire who wouldn\u0027t drink blood; it would have been funny if it wasn\u0027t so deadly. What should I do? That was the question that kept me awake long after the sun rose. What should I do? Forget about it and just drink human blood? Or stay true to my humanity and... die ?","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-s-assistant-the-saga-of-darren-shan-2/page-19.html","bookId":2438,"book":{"id":2438,"title":"The Vampire\u0027s Assistant (The Saga of Darren Shan #2)","description":"Storyline: The Saga of Darren Shan #2 : The Vampire\u0027s Assistant The story begins with the main protagonist of the last adventure, Darren Shan, and his guardian Larten Crepsley moving in for a drink of blood from an ex-scout.
