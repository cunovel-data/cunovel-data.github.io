She’s got to sing like a songbird. I mean, she told us everything and we didn’t even ask.”\\n\\n “Agreed. She’ll fold the minute they knock on her door.”\\n\\n “So?”\\n\\n “So she can’t know anything,” Dot said. “Can’t tell what she doesn’t know, right? That’s the first thing I said to her, after I said ‘Toxic Waste’ and she picked up the phone. I laid it out for her. ‘No names, no pack drill,’ I said. I told her a number, said half in advance, half on completion. Cash, fifties and hundreds, wrap ’em up good and FedEx the package to John Smith at Mail Boxes Etc. in Scarsdale.”\\n\\n “John Smith?”\\n\\n “First name that came to me. Soon as I got off the phone I went over and rented a box under that name. The owner’s Afghani, he doesn’t know Smith from Shinola. It’s better than the post office because you can call up and find out if they’ve got anything for you. I called yesterday and guess what?”\\n\\n “She sent the money?”\\n\\n She nodded. “ ‘Send half the money,’ I said, ‘and our field operative will call when he’s on the scene. He’ll introduce himself and get the information he requires. You’ll never meet him face-to-face, but he’ll coordinate with you and take care of everything. And afterward you’ll get a final call telling you where to send the balance.’ ”\\n\\n Keller thought about it. “There’s stuff they could trace,” he said. “The PO box, the mailbox. Records of phone calls.”\\n\\n “There’s always something.”\\n\\n “Uh-huh. What kind of a price did you set?”\\n\\n “Just on the high side of standard.”\\n\\n “And you got half in front, and she hasn’t got a clue who she sent it to.”\\n\\n “Meaning I could just keep it. I thought of that, obviously. If you turn it down, that’s probably what I’ll do.”\\n\\n “Just probably? You’re not going to send it back.”\\n\\n “No, but I could call around, try and find another shooter.”\\n\\n “I didn’t turn it down yet,” he said.\\n\\n “Take your time.”\\n\\n “The old man would have a fit. You know that, don’t you?”\\n\\n “Gee, I’m glad you told me that, Keller. It never would have occurred to me.”\\n\\n “What does that mean, anyway, ‘No names, no pack drill’? I’m familiar with the expression, I get the sense of it, but what’s a pack drill, do you happen to know?”\\n\\n “It’s just an expression, for God’s sake.”\\n\\n “Give me the letter again,” he said, and read it through rapidly. “Most of the time,” he said, “the people who hire these things, there’s other things they could do. They may think otherwise, but there’s usually another way out.”\\n\\n “So?”\\n\\n “So what choice has she got?”\\n\\n “Nelson,” Dot said, “you know what I just did? I watched your master talk himself into something.”\\n\\n “ Muscatine,” he said. “Do planes go there?”\\n\\n “Not if they can help it.”\\n\\n “What do I do, go there and call her up? ‘Toxic Waste,’ and then I wait for her to pick up?”\\n\\n “It’s ‘Toxic Shock’ now,” she said. “I changed the password for security reasons.”\\n\\n “Thank God for that,” he said. “You can’t be too careful.”\\n\\n Back at his apartment, he called Andria and made arrangements for her to care for Nelson in his absence. Then he found Muscatine on the map. You could probably fly there, or at least to Davenport, but Chicago wasn’t that far. United had hourly non-stops to Chicago, and O’Hare was a nice anonymous place to rent a car.\\n\\n He flew out in the morning, had a Hertz car waiting, and was in Muscatine and settled in a chain motel on the edge of the city by dinnertime. He ate right down the road at a Pizza Hut, came back and sat on the edge of his bed. He had used false identification to rent the car at O’Hare, and had registered at the motel under a different name and paid cash in advance for a week’s stay. Even so, he didn’t want to call the client from the motel. He was dealing with an amateur, and there were two principles to observe in dealing with amateurs. The first was to be ultra-professional yourself. The second, alas, was never to deal with an amateur.\\n\\n There was a pay phone just next door; he’d noticed it coming back from the Pizza Hut. He spent a quarter and dialed the number, and after two rings the machine answered and a computer-generated voice repeated the last four numbers of the number and invited him to leave his message at the tone.\\n\\n “Toxic Shock,” he said.\\n\\n Nothing happened. He stayed on the line for fifteen seconds and hung up.\\n\\n But was that long enough? Suppose she was washing her hands, or in the kitchen making coffee. He dug out another quarter, tried again. Same story. “Toxic Shock,” he said a second time, and waited for thirty seconds before hanging up.\\n\\n “Great system,” he said aloud, and went back to the motel.\\n\\n Back at the motel, he put on the television set and watched the last half of a movie about a wife who gets her lover to kill her husband. You didn’t have to have watched the first half to know what was going on, nor did you need to be a genius to know that everything was going to go wrong for them. Amateurs, he thought.\\n\\n He went out and tried the number again. “Toxic Shock.” Nothing.\\n\\n Hell.\\n\\n On the desk in his room, along with carry-out menus from half a dozen nearby fast-food outlets and a handout from the local Board of Realtors on the joys of settling in Muscatine, there was a flyer inviting him to try his luck gambling on a Mississippi riverboat. It looked appealing at first. You pictured an old paddle wheeler chunking along, heading down the river to New Orleans, with women in hoop skirts and men in frock coats and string ties, but he knew it wouldn’t be anything like that. The boat wouldn’t move, for one thing. It would stand at anchor, and boarding it would be like crossing the threshold of a hotel in Atlantic City.\\n\\n No thanks.\\n\\n Unpacking, he found the morning paper he’d read on the flight to Chicago. He hadn’t finished it, and did so now, saving the crossword puzzle for last. There was a step-quote, a saying of some sort running like a flight of stairs from the upper-left to lower-right corner. He liked those, because you had the sense that solving the crossword led to a greater solution. Sometimes, too, the step-quote itself was a pearl of wisdom of the sort you found in a fortune cookie.\\n\\n Often, though, the puzzles with step-quotes in them proved difficult, and this particular puzzle was one of those. There were a couple of areas he had trouble with, and they formed important parts of the step-quote, and he couldn’t work it out.\\n\\n There was a 900 number you could call. They printed it with the puzzle every morning, and for seventy-five cents they’d give you any three answers. You’d punch in 3-7-D on your touch-tone phone, and you’d get the answer to 37 down. He figured they used a computer. They couldn’t waste an actual human being’s time on that sort of thing.\\n\\n But did people really call in? Obviously they did, or the service wouldn’t exist. Keller found this baffling. He could see doing a crossword puzzle, it gave your mind a light workout and passed the time, but when he’d gone as far as he could he tossed the paper aside and got on with his life.\\n\\n Anyway, if you were dying of curiosity, all you had to do was wait a day. They printed a filled-in version of the previous day’s crossword in every paper. Why spend seventy-five cents for three answers when you could wait a few hours and get the whole thing for half a dollar?\\n\\n They were immature, he decided. He’d read that the true measure of human maturity was the ability to postpone gratification.\\n\\n Keller, ready to go out and try the number again, decided to postpone gratification. He took a hot shower and went to bed.\\n\\n In the morning he drove into downtown Muscatine and had breakfast at a diner. The crowd was almost exclusively male and most of the men wore suits. Keller, in a suit himself, read the local paper while he ate his breakfast. There was a crossword puzzle, but he took one look at it and gave it a pass. The longest word in it was six letters:Our northern neighbor. The way Keller figured it, when it came to crossword puzzles it was theTimes or nothing.\\n\\n There was a pay phone at the diner, but he didn’t want his conversation overheard by the movers and shakers of Greater Muscatine. Even if no one answered, he didn’t want anyone to hear him say “Toxic Shock.” He left the diner and found an outdoor pay phone at a gas station. He placed the call, said his two words, and in no time at all a woman cut in to say, “Hello? Hello?”\\n\\n Tinny phone, he thought. Rinky-dink local phone company, what could you expect. But it was better than the computer-generated phone message. At least you knew you were talking to a person.\\n\\n “It’s all right,” he said. “I’m here.”\\n\\n “I’m sorry I missed your call last night. I was out, I had to-”\\n\\n “Let’s not get into that,” he said. “Let’s not spend any more time on the phone than we have to.”\\n\\n “I’m sorry. Of course you’re right.”\\n\\n “I need to know some things. The name of the person I’m supposed to meet with, first of all.”\\n\\n There was a pause. Then, tentatively, she said, “My understanding was that there wasn’t to be a meeting.”\\n\\n “The other person,” he said, “that I’m supposed tomeet with, so to speak.”\\n\\n “Oh. I didn’t… I’m sorry. I’m not used to this.” No kidding, he thought.\\n\\n “His name is Stephen Lauderheim,” she said.\\n\\n “How do I find him? I don’t suppose you know his address.”\\n\\n “No, I’m afraid not. I know the license number of his car.”\\n\\n He copied it down, along with the information that the car was a two-year-old white Subaru squareback. That was useful, he told her, but he couldn’t cruise around town looking for a white Subaru. Where did he park this car?\\n\\n “Across the street from my house,” she said, “more often than I’d like.”\\n\\n “I don’t suppose he’s there now.”\\n\\n “No, I don’t think so. Let me look… No, he’s not. There was a message from him last night. In between your messages. Nasty, vile.”\\n\\n “I wish I had a photo of him,” he said. “That would help. I don’t suppose-”\\n\\n No photo, but she could certainly describe him. Tall, slender, light brown hair, late thirties, long face, square jaw, big white horse teeth. Oh, and he had a Kirk Douglas dimple in his chin. Oh, and she knew where he worked. At least he’d been working there the last time the police had been involved. Would that help?\\n\\n Keller rolled his eyes. “It might,” he said.\\n\\n “The name of the firm is Loud amp; Clear Software,” she said. “On Tyler Boulevard just beyond Five Mile Road. He’s a computer programmer or technician, something like that.” \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hit-man-keller-1/page-22.html","bookId":2312,"book":{"id":2312,"title":"Hit Man (Keller #1)","description":"Storyline: Hit Man (Keller #1) \\n Keller is an assassin – he is paid by the job and works for a mysterious man who nominates hits and passes on commissions from elsewhere.
