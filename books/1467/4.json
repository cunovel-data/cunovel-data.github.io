{"id":17965,"no":4,"title":"The Bolted Door IV","content":"THE perspiration was rolling off Granice’s forehead. Every few minutes he had to draw out his handkerchief and wipe the moisture from his haggard face. \n \n For an hour and a half he had been talking steadily, putting his case to the District Attorney. Luckily he had a speaking acquaintance with Allonby, and had obtained, without much difficulty, a private audience on the very day after his talk with Robert Denver. In the interval between he had hurried home, got out of his evening clothes, and gone forth again at once into the dreary dawn. His fear of Ascham and the alienist made it impossible for him to remain in his rooms. And it seemed to him that the only way of averting that hideous peril was by establishing, in some sane impartial mind, the proof of his guilt. Even if he had not been so incurably sick of life, the electric chair seemed now the only alternative to the strait-jacket. \n \n As he paused to wipe his forehead he saw the District Attorney glance at his watch. The gesture was significant, and Granice lifted an appealing hand. “I don’t expect you to believe me now — but can’t you put me under arrest, and have the thing looked into?” \n \n Allonby smiled faintly under his heavy grayish moustache. He had a ruddy face, full and jovial, in which his keen professional eyes seemed to keep watch over impulses not strictly professional. \n \n “Well, I don’t know that we need lock you up just yet. But of course I’m bound to look into your statement — ” \n \n Granice rose with an exquisite sense of relief. Surely Allonby wouldn’t have said that if he hadn’t believed him! \n \n “That’s all right. Then I needn’t detain you. I can be found at any time at my apartment.” He gave the address. \n \n The District Attorney smiled again, more openly. “What do you say to leaving it for an hour or two this evening? I’m giving a little supper at Rector’s — quiet, little affair, you understand: just Miss Melrose — I think you know her — and a friend or two; and if you’ll join us . . . ” \n \n Granice stumbled out of the office without knowing what reply he had made. \n \n He waited for four days — four days of concentrated horror. During the first twenty-four hours the fear of Ascham’s alienist dogged him; and as that subsided, it was replaced by the exasperating sense that his avowal had made no impression on the District Attorney. Evidently, if he had been going to look into the case, Allonby would have been heard from before now. . . . And that mocking invitation to supper showed clearly enough how little the story had impressed him! \n \n Granice was overcome by the futility of any farther attempt to inculpate himself. He was chained to life — a “prisoner of consciousness.” Where was it he had read the phrase? Well, he was learning what it meant. In the glaring night-hours, when his brain seemed ablaze, he was visited by a sense of his fixed identity, of his irreducible, inexpugnable selfness, keener, more insidious, more unescapable, than any sensation he had ever known. He had not guessed that the mind was capable of such intricacies of self-realization, of penetrating so deep into its own dark windings. Often he woke from his brief snatches of sleep with the feeling that something material was clinging to him, was on his hands and face, and in his throat — and as his brain cleared he understood that it was the sense of his own loathed personality that stuck to him like some thick viscous substance. \n \n Then, in the first morning hours, he would rise and look out of his window at the awakening activities of the street — at the street-cleaners, the ash-cart drivers, and the other dingy workers flitting hurriedly by through the sallow winter light. Oh, to be one of them — any of them — to take his chance in any of their skins! They were the toilers — the men whose lot was pitied — the victims wept over and ranted about by altruists and economists; and how gladly he would have taken up the load of any one of them, if only he might have shaken off his own! But, no — the iron circle of consciousness held them too: each one was hand-cuffed to his own hideous ego. Why wish to be any one man rather than another? The only absolute good was not to be . . . And Flint, coming in to draw his bath, would ask if he preferred his eggs scrambled or poached that morning? \n \n On the fifth day he wrote a long urgent letter to Allonby; and for the succeeding two days he had the occupation of waiting for an answer. He hardly stirred from his rooms, in his fear of missing the letter by a moment; but would the District Attorney write, or send a representative: a policeman, a “secret agent,” or some other mysterious emissary of the law? \n \n On the third morning Flint, stepping softly — as if, confound it! his master were ill — entered the library where Granice sat behind an unread newspaper, and proferred a card on a tray. \n \n Granice read the name — J. B. Hewson — and underneath, in pencil, “From the District Attorney’s office.” He started up with a thumping heart, and signed an assent to the servant. \n \n Mr. Hewson was a slight sallow nondescript man of about fifty — the kind of man of whom one is sure to see a specimen in any crowd. “Just the type of the successful detective,” Granice reflected as he shook hands with his visitor. \n \n And it was in that character that Mr. Hewson briefly introduced himself. He had been sent by the District Attorney to have “a quiet talk” with Mr. Granice — to ask him to repeat the statement he had made about the Lenman murder. \n \n His manner was so quiet, so reasonable and receptive, that Granice’s self-confidence returned. Here was a sensible man — a man who knew his business — it would be easy enough to make him see through that ridiculous alibi! Granice offered Mr. Hewson a cigar, and lighting one himself — to prove his coolness — began again to tell his story. \n \n He was conscious, as he proceeded, of telling it better than ever before. Practice helped, no doubt; and his listener’s detached, impartial attitude helped still more. He could see that Hewson, at least, had not decided in advance to disbelieve him, and the sense of being trusted made him more lucid and more consecutive. Yes, this time his words would certainly carry conviction . . . \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1348/40483.html","bookId":1467,"book":{"id":1467,"title":"Tales of Men and Ghosts","description":"简介： Down his spine he felt the man\u0027s injured stare.
