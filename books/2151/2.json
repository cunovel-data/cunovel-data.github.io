But I didn\u0027t want a boyfriend that wanted to wear me like a new finball jersey. I wanted someone truly special, some\n \"We\u0027ll be there!\" Wave said with a smile as the two titans swam off to class.\n \"I have to study for my marine biology exam,\" I lied.\n \"Tomorrow,\" Wave insisted. \"Today you have to study boyfriend biology,\" and she dragged me off to lunch.\n underwater kiss?\" Chainsaw asked skeptically at our lockers. It was after second bell in the crowded hallway. Chainsaw, my best friend and worst enemy, was born wearing braces, and, man, those things could cut through steel! \"What girl has ever kissed you out of the water?\" he ribbed me. \"Shhh!\" I whispered.\n I didn\u0027t want my romantic rescue to flash all over school. I\u0027m a fringe guy, even more unpopular than Chainsaw, content simply not to end up trapped inside a senior\u0027s locker. On a scale of one to ten, I give myself a seven and a half in looks, but I get extra points for personality, which, unfortunately, most people have never seen. And did I mention I\u0027m smart?The Godfather.\n \"Maybe it was just a dream!\" Chainsaw said, and laughed.\n I rolled my eyes, pulling my European history textbook from my locker and stuffing it into my backpack.\n \"And you didn\u0027t touch her?\" he went on in typical Chainsaw fashion.\n \"I was drowning, dude!\"\n \"A gorgeous babe kisses you and you don\u0027t make a move?\" he asked in hormonal disbelief.\n \"I thought I was going to die! What part aren\u0027t you getting?\"\n \"Dude . . . did you at least get her number?\"\n \"You don\u0027t get it - I\u0027ve never seen anything like her before,\" I confessed.\n \"Even in my dreams, I always get the number,\" Chainsaw said, slamming his locker shut. \"Keep dreaming, Stone,\" he added, sauntering off.\n \"I got this instead!\" I said, catching up and proudly dangling the necklace in front of him. \"Anyone can get a phone number!\"\n His eyes were momentarily mesmerized by the swinging silver heart.\n \"Well she didn\u0027t exactly give it to me.\"\n Chain scrutinized the necklace like a pawnbroker. \"Not bad, Stone,\" he said, hitting me in the arm. \"Not bad at all.\"\n My cousin Dennis spotted the love of his life on the crowded New Jersey turnpike and engaged her in conversation. When the traffic moved and she changed lanes he realized he hadn\u0027t gotten her number. So he bought a billboard on that same stretch of highway. Now they have three kids.\n But I wasn\u0027t destined to find my true love via a giant billboard, the newspaper, or the Internet. I had to go to the sea.\n I wrote my message on a library computer during third bell study hall, and then Xeroxed it on sheets of yellow, pink, red, and turquoise paper. I was temporarily blinded by the continuous flash from the copier when I heard a screeching voice exclaim, \"You\u0027re using up all my paper!\"\n Mrs. Barney, our toothpick-thin librarian, reached for the paper tray. \" \u0027Single White Male\u0027,\" she read. \"This looks like a personal ad!\" she exclaimed, her forehead wrinkling.\n I quickly grabbed the paper from her hand and\n \"All these copies for one report?\" she said, scrunching her witchlike nose.\n \"Did I say report?\" I stammered. \"I meant . . . collage. For art.\"\n \"Personal ads,\" she said. \"I remember when all one had to do was go to the disco.\"\n I almost cracked at the thought of Mrs. Barney groovin\u0027 with a John Travolta look-alike.\n \"I can\u0027t imagine a world where love is so impersonal. There was nothing more personal than a man in tight pants spinning a girl around a room all night,\" she said, gazing out the window at the ocean far below. \"But don\u0027t let me get you down,\" she added, placing her hand on my shoulder. \"Everyone finds their true love, if they want to.\"\n \"I\u0027m hoping to meet mine at the south goalpost!\" I said, stuffing the ads in my backpack, and bolting from the library.\n Chainsaw and I snuck off school property during lunch and raced down the hill to the beach, where we plastered the pier with my ad. We even tacked sheets to an empty lifeguard stand. By the time we were finished, the beachfront looked like Times Square on New Year\u0027s Day. Exhausted, Chainsaw and I made our\n The message read: \"SWM, 15, seeking golden-haired beauty who saved my life. I wear your silver heart close to my own. Meet me at Seaside High Stadium (south goalpost) at 8:30 A.M. I want to thank you.\"\n I didn\u0027t put down my name, phone number, or e-mail address, to avoid hassles from the local graffiti police, and to weed out any desperate forty-year-old women with amorous intentions!\n Luckily, there wasn\u0027t much activity on the beachfront today. Just an orange-vested man taking down brightly colored sheets hanging all over the pier. Of course it\u0027s dangerous to approach land, but at the moment I was more worried about being near my mother. I had to figure out a solution - and fast. Merpeople can only inhale air for about ten minutes before having to return underwater.\n \"I need help, now,\" I said, grabbing her arm. \"I wanted to use the necklace for my Earthee project. I was going to return it right after school. Mom never would have known it was gone!\"\n \"So Earthdude grabbed it in the struggle for his life?\" Wave realized, shaking her head in disapproval.\n \"I have to find that heart immediately! If Mom opens her Butterfly Venus shell - \"\n Wave gasped, pulling at her hair in disgust. \"A seagull pooped on me!\"\n \"No, it\u0027s just a piece of paper,\" I said, and laughed, grabbing it before it blew away. Crisp letters written in black ink smeared onto my wet hand. \" \u0027SWM,\u0027 \" I read slowly.\n \"Let\u0027s go before someone sees us!\" Wave said anxiously.\n \" \u0027Fifteen . . .\u0027 \" I continued. \" \u0027Seeking golden-haired beauty.\u0027 \" I gazed up at Waverly. \"My hair is golden.\"\n \"So it is, but it\u0027ll turn blue if we don\u0027t return underwater!\"\n She inched away from me but I quickly grabbed her arm.\n \" \u0027Who saved my life.\u0027 How poetic!\" I said dreamily, gazing at the cloud-filled sky.\n \" \u0027Who saved my life?\u0027 \" Wave repeated, suddenly\n Our eyes locked in disbelief.\n \"Silver heart?\" Wave repeated, incredulous.\n \"Saved his life . . .\"\n \"Golden hair? Lilly, it\u0027s a message from that Earthdude! He\u0027s trying to find you!\"\n \"It couldn\u0027t be . . . that\u0027s impossible,\" I said, bewildered.\n \"This is way dangerous,\" Wave argued.\n \"It\u0027s totally glacial! Read the rest - I\u0027m too freaked out!\"\n \" \u0027Meet me at Seaside High Stadium (south goalpost) at 8:30 A.M. I want to thank you,\u0027 \" she read.\n \"Thank me?\" I asked, grabbing the parchment. Had my Earthdude written this?\n \"Don\u0027t even think about it! We never saw this paper,\" Waverly urged, grabbing the note and tossing it into the sea.\n My heart fell as the pink paper gently floated away from us on the ocean\u0027s surface. It drifted out of sight on a cresting wave.\n I could tell my mom I took her locket to school without her permission and lost it, and she would immediately sell my precious dolphin, Bubbles. Or I could tell her the truth, that my lips were pressed against a forbidden Earthee and he yanked it off inme.\n My options were clear. I had to get the necklace back.\n \"It\u0027s either a day at Seaside High or an eternity in an Atlantic boarding school,\" I concluded, and we dove back into the water.\n Wave and I rode Bubbles, my dolphin, to the Underworld far below the reef\u0027s warm water and bright colors. The water in the Underworld was frigid and the only colors that could be seen even with our sharp mermaid eyes were indigo and purple. To get there we had to ride past the finball stadium, past the school, past the recycling center, and dive down into a steep, jagged valley with giant stingrays swarming around. We\u0027d never been this far from home before.\n \"I don\u0027t think this is a good idea,\" Wave said, sitting behind me, tugging my hair.\n Bubbles, too, was reluctant to press on and I had to tap her reassuringly to dive deeper.\n \"It\u0027s so arctic!\" Wave cried through chattering teeth as we sped to lower depths.\n \"Don\u0027t be such a jellyfish! We\u0027ll be there soon!\"\n \"That\u0027s what I\u0027m afraid of! If those tiger sharks don\u0027t kill us, our parents will.\"\n Just then I, too, noticed several tiger sharks swarming over a mangled tuna below us.\n \"Relax, they\u0027ve already found lunch,\" I said, steering Bubbles around the feeding predators.\n \"Yeah, but we\u0027re dessert,\" Wave yelled, as the biggest shark broke away from the rest. \"They\u0027ve spotted us!\"\n Suddenly our lives were in major danger!\n Pacific Reef had shark fences that repelled sharks from invading our city, but every once in a while one got through and caused panic. Only last year a merman was attacked on his way to a finball game. We usually carried shark mace in our purses, but I had foolishly taken mine out earlier to make room for my crystal sea horse collection which I intended to barter in the Underworld.\n The biggest shark was fast approaching and Bubbles was whining anxiously. I tapped her hurriedly. \"Go, baby, go!\"\n \"Lilly, use your mace!\" Wave shrieked.\n \"Mine\u0027s at home - use yours!\"\n \"Home? What good\u0027s it doing at home?\" She scrambled through her pink backpack as the shark drew closer. \"I can\u0027t find it!\"\n \"Look harder,\" I shouted.\n \"Here\u0027s my compact! My comb!\"\n \"Today, Waverly! Today!\"\n \"My lobster sandwich from lunch . . . here it is!\"\n I think even Bubbles let out a shriek.\n The shark was now just yards away, his gray eyes piercing us and his jaws open, waiting for a triple-decker treat.\n \"Help!\" Wave called desperately. \"Help! Someone help us!\"\n \"The sandwich! That\u0027s why he\u0027s following us - he smells dead fish,\" I screamed.\n \"Soon he\u0027s going to smell dead mermaids!\" Wave screamed, squeezing my waist.\n \"Throw him the sandwich!\" I commanded.\n But Wave just grabbed me harder.\n I peeled the sandwich from Waverly\u0027s paralyzed hands and turned Bubbles around sharply. The shark, rising to attack us, opened his jaws again and I threw the lobster sandwich as hard as I could into his mouth. The shark seemed bewildered for a moment, then suddenly pleased, and swam past so closely I could have reached out and touched his belly.\n \"We\u0027re alive!\" Waverly laughed, waving her arms.\n \"That was electric!\" I exclaimed.\n Even Bubbles smiled brightly.\n \"Now let\u0027s go home,\" Waverly said.\n \"But we\u0027re almost there.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/teenage-mermaid/page-2.html","bookId":2151,"book":{"id":2151,"title":"Teenage Mermaid","description":"Storyline: \n Spencer almost drowns in a surfing accident when a sparkling, golden girl saves him with a kiss of life before she suddenly disappears.
