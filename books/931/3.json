{"id":39671,"no":3,"title":"CHAPTER III: A TOUGH YARN","content":"“You had a close shave the other night,” one of the boatmen remarked to Frank, as a few days after the adventure he strolled down with Ruthven and Handcock to talk to the boatman whose boat had been lost, “a very narrow shave. I had one out there myself when I was just about your age, nigh forty years ago. I went out for a sail with my father in his fishing boat, and I didn\u0027t come back for three years. That was the only long voyage I ever went. I\u0027ve been sticking to fishing ever since.” “How was it you were away three years?” Handcock asked, “and what was the adventure? Tell us about it.” “Well, it\u0027s rather a long yarn,” the boatman said. “Well, your best plan, Jack,” Ruthven said, putting his hand in his pocket and bringing out sixpence, “will be for you to go across the road and wet your whistle before you begin.” “Thank ye, young gentleman. I will take three o\u0027 grog and an ounce of \u0027bacca.” He went across to the public house, and soon returned with a long clay in his hand. Then he sat down on the shingle with his back against a boat, and the boys threw themselves down close to him. “Now,” he began, when he had filled his pipe with great deliberation and got it fairly alight, “this here yarn as I\u0027m going to tell you ain\u0027t no gammon. Most of the tales which gets told on the beach to visitors as comes down here and wants to hear of sea adventures is just lies from beginning to end. Now, I ain\u0027t that sort, leastways, I shouldn\u0027t go to impose upon young gents like you as ha\u0027 had a real adventure of your own, and showed oncommon good pluck and coolness too. I don\u0027t say, mind ye, that every word is just gospel. My mates as ha\u0027 known me from a boy tells me that I\u0027ve \u0027bellished the yarn since I first told it, and that all sorts of things have crept in which wasn\u0027t there first. That may be so. When a man tells a story a great many times, naturally he can\u0027t always tell it just the same, and he gets so mixed up atween what he told last and what he told first that he don\u0027t rightly know which was which when he wants to tell it just as it really happened. So if sometimes it appears to you that I\u0027m steering rather wild, just you put a stopper on and bring me up all standing with a question.” There was a quiet humor about the boatman\u0027s face, and the boys winked at each other as much as to say that after such an exordium they must expect something rather staggering. The boatman took two or three hard whiffs at his pipe and then began. “It was towards the end of September in 1832, that\u0027s just forty years ago now, that I went out with my father and three hands in the smack, the Flying Dolphin. I\u0027d been at sea with father off and on ever since I was about nine years old, and a smarter boy wasn\u0027t to be found on the beach. The Dolphin was a good sea boat, but she wasn\u0027t, so to say, fast, and I dunno\u0027 as she was much to look at, for the old man wasn\u0027t the sort of chap to chuck away his money in paint or in new sails as long as the old ones could be pieced and patched so as to hold the wind. We sailed out pretty nigh over to the French coast, and good sport we had. We\u0027d been out two days when we turned her head homewards. The wind was blowing pretty strong, and the old man remarked, he thought we was in for a gale. There was some talk of our running in to Calais and waiting till it had blown itself out, but the fish might have spoil before the Wind dropped, so we made up our minds to run straight into Dover and send the fish up from there. The night came on wild and squally, and as dark as pitch. It might be about eight bells, and I and one of the other hands had turned in, when father gave a sudden shout down the hatch, \u0027All hands on deck.\u0027 I was next to the steps and sprang up \u0027em. Just as I got to the top something grazed my face. I caught at it, not knowing what it was, and the next moment there was a crash, and the Dolphin went away from under my feet. I clung for bare life, scarce awake yet nor knowing what had happened. The next moment I was under water. I still held on to the rope and was soon out again. By this time I was pretty well awake to what had happened. A ship running down channel had walked clean over the poor old Dolphin, and I had got hold of the bobstay. It took me some time to climb up on to the bowsprit, for every time she pitched I went under water. However, I got up at last and swarmed along the bowsprit and got on board. There was a chap sitting down fast asleep there. I walked aft to the helmsman. Two men were pacing up and down in front of him. \u0027You\u0027re a nice lot, you are,\u0027 I said, \u0027to go running down Channel at ten knots an hour without any watch, a-walking over ships and a-drowning of seamen. I\u0027ll have the law of ye, see if I don\u0027t.\u0027 “\u0027Jeerusalem!\u0027 said one, \u0027who have we here?\u0027 “\u0027My name is Jack Perkins,\u0027 says I, \u0027and I\u0027m the sole survivor, as far as I knows, of the smack, the Flying Dolphin, as has been run down by this craft and lost with all hands.\u0027 “\u0027Darn the Flying Dolphin, and you too,\u0027 says the man, and he begins to walk up and down the deck a-puffn\u0027 of a long cigar as if nothing had happened. “\u0027Oh, come,\u0027 says I, \u0027this won\u0027t do. Here you\u0027ve been and run down a smack, drowned father and the other three hands, and your lookout fast asleep, and you does nothing.\u0027 “\u0027I suppose,\u0027 said the captain, sarcastic, \u0027you want me to jump over to look for \u0027em. You want me to heave the ship to in this gale and to invite yer father perlitely to come on board. P\u0027raps you\u0027d like a grapnel put out to see if I couldn\u0027t hook the smack and bring her up again. Perhaps you\u0027d like to be chucked overboard yourself. Nobody asked you to come on board, nobody wanted your company. I reckon the wisest thing you can do is to go for\u0027ard and turn in.\u0027 There didn\u0027t seem much for me to do else, so I went forward to the forecastle. There most of the hands were asleep, but two or three were sitting up yarning. I told \u0027em my story and what this captain had said. “\u0027He\u0027s a queer hand is the skipper,\u0027 one of \u0027em said, \u0027and hasn\u0027t got a soft place about him. Well, my lad, I\u0027m sorry for what\u0027s happened, but talking won\u0027t do it any good. You\u0027ve got a long voyage before you, and you\u0027d best turn in and make yourself comfortable for it.\u0027 “\u0027I ain\u0027t going a long voyage,\u0027 says I, beginning to wipe my eye, \u0027I wants to be put ashore at the first port.\u0027 “\u0027Well, my lad, I daresay the skipper will do that, but as we\u0027re bound for the coast of Chili from Hamburg, and ain\u0027t likely to be there for about five months, you\u0027ve got, as I said, a long voyage before you. If the weather had been fine the skipper might have spoken some ship in the Channel, and put you on board, but before the gale\u0027s blown out we shall be hundreds of miles at sea. Even if it had been fine I don\u0027t suppose the skipper would have parted with you, especially if you told him the watch was asleep. He would not care next time he entered an English port to have a claim fixed on his ship for the vally of the smack.\u0027 “I saw what the sailor said was like enough, and blamed myself for having let out about the watch. However, there was no help for it, and I turned into an empty bunk and cried myself to sleep. What a voyage that was, to be sure! The ship was a Yankee and so was the master and mates. The crew were of all sorts, Dutch, and Swedes, and English, a Yank or two, and a sprinklin\u0027 of niggers. It was one of those ships they call a hell on earth, and cussing and kicking and driving went on all day. I hadn\u0027t no regular place give me, but helped the black cook, and pulled at ropes, and swabbed the decks, and got kicked and cuffed all round. The skipper did not often speak to me, but when his eye lighted on me he gave an ugly sort of look, as seemed to say, \u0027You\u0027d better ha\u0027 gone down with the others. You think you\u0027re going to report the loss of the smack, and to get damages against the Potomac, do you? we shall see.\u0027 The crew were a rough lot, but the spirit seemed taken out of \u0027em by the treatment they met with. It was a word and a blow with the mates, and they would think no more of catching up a handspike and stretching a man senseless on the deck than I should of killing a fly. There was two or three among \u0027em of a better sort than the others. The best of \u0027em was the carpenter, an old Dutchman. \u0027Leetle boy,\u0027 he used to say to me, \u0027you keep yourself out of the sight of de skipper. Bad man dat. Me much surprise if you get to de end of dis voyage all right. You best work vera hard and give him no excuse to hit you. If he do, by gosh, he kill you, and put down in de log, Boy killed by accident.\u0027 “I felt that this was so myself, and I did my work as well as I could. One day, however, when we were near the line I happened to upset a bucket with some tar. The captain was standing close by. “\u0027You young dog,\u0027 he said, \u0027you\u0027ve done that a purpose,\u0027 and before I could speak he caught up the bucket by the handle and brought it down on my head with all his might. The next thing I remember was, I was lying in a bunk in the forecastle. Everything looked strange to me, and I couldn\u0027t raise my head. After a time I made shift to turn it round, and saw old Jans sitting on a chest mending a jacket. I called him, but my voice was so low I hardly seemed to hear it myself. “\u0027Ah, my leetle boy!\u0027 he said, \u0027I am glad to hear you speak again. Two whole weeks you say nothing except talk nonsense.\u0027 “\u0027Have I been ill?\u0027 I asked. “\u0027You haf been vera bad,\u0027 he said. \u0027De captain meant to kill you, I haf no doubt, and he pretty near do it. After he knock you down he said you dead. He sorry for accident, not mean to hit you so hard, but you dead and better be tossed overboard at once. De mates they come up and take your hands and feet. Den I insist dat I feel your wrist. Two or three of us dey stood by me. Captain he vera angry, say we mutinous dogs. I say not mutinous, but wasn\u0027t going to see a boy who was only stunned thrown overboard. We say if he did dat we make complaint before consul when we get to port. De skipper he cuss and swear awful. Howebber we haf our way and carry you here. You haf fever and near die. Tree days after we bring you here de captain he swear you shamming and comed to look at you hisself, but he see that it true and tink you going to die. He go away wid smile on his face. Every day he ask if you alive, and give grunt when I say yes. Now you best keep vera quiet. You no talk \u0027cept when no one else here but me. Other times lie wid your face to the side and your eyes shut. Best keep you here as long as we can, de longer de better. He make you come on deck and work as soon as he think you strong enough to stand. Best get pretty strong before you go out.\u0027 “For another three weeks I lay in my bunk. I only ate a little gruel when others were there, but when the skipper was at dinner Jans would bring me strong soup and meat from the caboose. The captain came several times and shook me and swore I was shamming, but I only answered in a whisper and seemed as faint as a girl. All this time the Potomac was making good way, and was running fast down the coast of South America. The air was getting cool and fresh. “\u0027I tink,\u0027 Jans said one evening to me, \u0027dat dis not go on much much longer. De crew getting desperate. Dey talk and mutter among demselves. Me thinks we have trouble before long.\u0027 “The next day one of the mates came in with a bucket of water. \u0027There! you skulking young hound,\u0027 he said as he threw it over me; \u0027you\u0027d best get out, or the skipper will come and rouse you up himself.\u0027 “I staggered on to the floor. I had made up my mind to sham weak, but I did not need to pretend at first, for having been six weeks in bed, I felt strange and giddy when I got up. I slipped on my clothes and went out on deck, staggered to the bulwarks and held on. The fresh air soon set me straight, and I felt that I was pretty strong again. However, I pretended to be able to scarce stand, and, holding on by the bulwark, made my way aft. “\u0027You young dog,\u0027 the skipper said, \u0027you\u0027ve been shamming for the last six weeks. I reckon I\u0027ll sharpen you up now,\u0027 and he hit me a heavy blow with a rattan he held in his hand. There was a cry of \u0027Shame!\u0027 from some of the men. As quick as thought the skipper pulled a pistol from his pocket. “\u0027Who cried “Shame”?\u0027” he asked looking round. “No one answered. Still holding the pistol in his hand he gave me several more cuts, and then told me to swab the deck. I did it, pretending all the time I was scarce strong enough to keep my feet. Then I made my way forward and sat down against the bulwark, as if nigh done up, till night came. That night as I lay in my bunk I heard the men talking in whispers together. I judged from what they said that they intended to wait for another week, when they expected to enter Magellan Straits, and then to attack and throw the officers overboard. Nothing seemed settled as to what they would do afterwards. Some were in favor of continuing the voyage to port, and there giving out that the captain and officers had been washed overboard in a storm; when, if all stood true to each other, the truth could never be known, although suspicions might arise. The others, however, insisted that you never could be sure of every one, and that some one would be sure to peach. They argued in favor of sailing west and beaching the ship on one of the Pacific islands, where they could live comfortably and take wives among the native women. If they were ever found they could then say that the ship was blown out of her course and wrecked there, and that the captain and officers had been drowned or killed by the natives. It seemed to me that this party were the strongest. For the next week I was thrashed and kicked every day and had I been as weak as I pretended to be, I\u0027m sure they would have killed me. However, thanks to the food Jans brought me, for I was put on bread and water, I held on. At last we entered the straits. The men were very quiet that day, and the captain in a worse temper than usual. I did not go to sleep, and turned out at the midnight watch, for I was made to keep watch although I was on duty all day. As the watch came in I heard them say to the others, \u0027In ten minutes\u0027 time.\u0027 Presently I saw them come out, and joining the watch on deck they went aft quietly in a body. They had all got handspikes in their hands. Then there was a rush. Two pistol shots were fired, and then there was a splash, and I knew that the officer on watch was done for. Then they burst into the aft cabins. There were pistol shots and shouts, and for three or four minutes the fight went on. Then all was quiet. Then they came up on deck again and I heard three splashes, that accounted for the captain and the two other mates. I thought it safe now to go aft. I found that six of the men had been killed. These were thrown overboard, and then the crew got at the spirit stores and began to drink. I looked about for Jans, and found him presently sitting on the deck by the bulwark. “\u0027Ah, my leetle boy!\u0027 he said, \u0027you have just come in time. I have been shot through the body. I was not in de fight, but was standing near when dey rushed at de officer on watch. De first pistol he fire missed de man he aim at and hit me. Well, it was shust as well. I am too old to care for living among de black peoples, and I did not want a black wife at all. So matters haf not turned out so vera bad. Get me some water.\u0027 “I got him some, but in five minutes the poor old Dutchman was dead. There was no one on deck. All were shouting and singing in the captain\u0027s cabin, so I went and turned in forward. Morning was just breaking when I suddenly woke. There was a great light, and running on deck I saw the fire pouring out from the cabin aft. I suppose they had all drunk themselves stupid and had upset a light, and the fire had spread and suffocated them all. Anyhow, there were none of them to be seen. I got hold of a water keg and placed it in a boat which luckily hung out on its davits, as Jans had, the day before, been calking a seam in her side just above the water\u0027s edge. I made a shift to lower it, threw off the falls, and getting out the oars, rowed off. I lay by for some little time, but did not see a soul on deck. Then, as I had nowhere particular to go, I lay down and slept. On getting up I found that I had drifted two or three miles from the ship, which was now a mere smoking shell, the greater part being burnt to the Water\u0027s edge. Two miles to the north lay the land, and getting out an oar at the stern I sculled her to shore. I suppose I had been seen, or that the flames of the ship had called down the people, for there they were in the bay, and such a lot of creatures I never set eyes on. Men and women alike was pretty nigh naked, and dirt is no name for them. Though I was but a boy I was taller than most. They came round me and jabbered and jabbered till I was nigh deafened. Over and over again they pointed to the ship. I thought they wanted to know whether I belonged to it, but it couldn\u0027t have been that, because when I nodded a lot of \u0027em jumped into some canoes which was lying ashore, and taking me with them paddled off to the ship. I suppose they really wanted to know if they could have what they could find. That wasn\u0027t much, but it seemed a treasure to them. There was a lot of burned beams floating about alongside, and all of these which had iron or copper bolts or fastenings they took in tow and rowed ashore. We hadn\u0027t been gone many hundred yards from the vessel when she sunk. Well, young gentlemen, for upwards of two years I lived with them critturs. My clothes soon wore out, and I got to be as naked and dirty as the rest of \u0027em. They were good hands at fishing, and could spear a fish by the light of a torch wonderful. In other respects they didn\u0027t seem to have much sense. They lived, when I first went there, in holes scratched in the side of a hill, but I taught \u0027em to make huts, making a sort of ax out of the iron saved. In summer they used to live in these, but in winter, when it was awful cold, we lived in the holes, which were a sight warmer than the huts. Law, what a time that was! I had no end of adventures with wild beasts. The way the lions used to roar and the elephants—” “I think, Jack,” Ruthven interrupted, “that this must be one of the embellishments which have crept in since you first began telling the tale. I don\u0027t think I should keep it in if I were you, because the fact that there are neither lions or elephants in South America throws a doubt upon the accuracy of this portion of your story.” “It may be, sir,” the sailor said, with a twinkle of his eyes, “that the elephants and lions may not have been in the first story. Now I think of it, I can\u0027t recall that they were; but, you see, people wants to know all about it. They ain\u0027t satisfied when I tell \u0027em that I lived two years among these chaps. They wants to know how I passed my time, and whether there were any wild beasts, and a lot of such like questions, and, in course, I must answer them. So then, you see, naturally, \u0027bellishments creeps in; but I did live there for two years, that\u0027s gospel truth, and I did go pretty nigh naked, and in winter was pretty near starved to death over and over again. When the ground was too hard to dig up roots, and the sea was too rough for the canoes to put out, it went hard with us, and very often we looked more like living skelingtons than human beings. Every time a ship came in sight they used to hurry me away into the woods. I suppose they found me useful, and didn\u0027t want to part with me. At last I got desperate, and made up my mind I\u0027d make a bolt whatever came of it. They didn\u0027t watch me when there were no ships near. I suppose they thought there was nowhere for me to run to, so one night I steals down to the shore, gets into a canoe, puts in a lot of roots which I had dug up and hidden away in readiness, and so makes off. I rowed hard all night, for I knew they would be after me when they found I had gone. Them straits is sometimes miles and miles across; at other times not much more than a ship\u0027s length, and the tide runs through \u0027em like a mill race. I had chosen a time when I had the tide with me, and soon after morning I came to one of them narrow places. I should like to have stopped here, because it would have been handy for any ship as passed; but the tide run so strong, and the rocks were so steep on both sides, that I couldn\u0027t make a landing. Howsomdever, directly it widened out, I managed to paddle into the back water and landed there. Well, gents, would you believe me, if there wasn\u0027t two big allygaters sitting there with their mouths open ready to swallow me, canoe and all, when I came to shore.” “No, Jack, I\u0027m afraid we can\u0027t believe that. We would if we could, you know, but alligators are not fond of such cold weather as you\u0027d been having, nor do they frequent the seashore.” “Ah, but this, you see, was a straits, Master Ruthven, just a narrow straits, and I expect the creatures took it for a river.” “No, no, Jack, we can\u0027t swallow the alligators, any more than they could swallow you and your canoe.” “Well,” the sailor said with a sigh, “I won\u0027t say no more about the allygaters. I can\u0027t rightly recall when they came into the story. Howsomdever, I landed, you can believe that, you know.” “Oh yes, we can quite believe, Jack, that, if you were there, in that canoe, in that back water, with the land close ahead, you did land.” The sailor looked searchingly at Ruthven and then continued: “I hauled the canoe up and hid it in some bushes, and it were well I did, for a short time afterwards a great—” and he paused. “Does the hippypotybus live in them ere waters, young gents?” “He does not, Jack,” Ruthven said. “Then it\u0027s clear,” the sailor said, “that it wasn\u0027t a hippypotybus. It must have been a seal.” “Yes, it might have been a seal,” Ruthven said. “What did he do?” “Well he just took a look at me, gents, winked with one eye, as much as to say, \u0027I see you,\u0027 and went down again. There warn\u0027t nothing else as he could do, was there?” “It was the best thing he could do anyhow,” Ruthven said. “Well, gents, I lived there for about three weeks, and then a ship comes along, homeward bound, and I goes out and hails her. At first they thought as I was a native as had learned to speak English, and it wasn\u0027t till they\u0027d boiled me for three hours in the ship\u0027s copper as they got at the color of my skin, and could believe as I was English. So I came back here and found the old woman still alive, and took to fishing again; but it was weeks and weeks before I could get her or any one else to believe as I was Jack Perkins. And that\u0027s all the story, young gents. Generally I tells it a sight longer to the gents as come down from London in summer; but, you see, I can\u0027t make much out of it when ye won\u0027t let me have \u0027bellishments.” “And how much of it is true altogether, Jack?” Frank asked. “Really how much?” “It\u0027s all true as I have told you, young masters,” the boatman said. “It were every bit true about the running down of the smack, and me being nearly killed by the skipper, and the mutiny, and the burning of the vessel, and my living for a long time—no, I won\u0027t stick to the two years, but it might have been three weeks, with the natives before a ship picked me up. And that\u0027s good enough for a yarn, ain\u0027t it?” “Quite good enough, Jack, and we\u0027re much obliged to you; but I should advise you to drop the embellishments in future.” “It ain\u0027t no use, Master Hargate, they will have \u0027bellishments, and if they will have \u0027em, Jack Perkins isn\u0027t the man to disappint \u0027em; and, Lord bless you, sir, the stiffer I pitches it in the more liberal they is with their tips. Thank ye kindly all round, gentlemen. Yes, I do feel dry after the yarn.” \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3113/85706.html","bookId":931,"book":{"id":931,"title":"By Sheer Pluck","description":"简介： Now, Hargate, what a fellow you are!
