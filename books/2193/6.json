{"id":100749,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"We were silent in the elevator. As Alcide unlocked his apartment, I leaned against the wall. I was a mess: tired, conflicted, and agitated by the fracas with the biker and Debbie\u0027s vandalism.\\n\\n I felt like apologizing, but I didn\u0027t know what for.\\n\\n \"Good night,\" I said, at the door to my room. \"Oh, here. Thanks.\" I shrugged out of his coat and held it out to him. He hung it over the back of one of the bar stools at the eat-in counter.\\n\\n \"Need help with your zipper?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"It would be great if you could get it started.\" I turned my back to him. He\u0027d zipped it up the last couple of inches when I was getting dressed, and I appreciated his thinking of this before he vanished into his room.\\n\\n I felt his big fingers against my back, and the little hiss of the zipper. Then something unexpected happened; I felt him touch me again.\\n\\n I shivered all over as his fingers trailed down my skin.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t know what to do.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t know what I wanted to do.\\n\\n I made myself rum to face him. His face was as uncertain as mine.\\n\\n \"Worst possible time,\" I said. \"You\u0027re on the rebound. I\u0027m looking for my boyfriend; granted, he\u0027s my unfaithful boyfriend, but still ...\"\\n\\n \"Bad timing,\" he agreed, and his hands settled on my shoulders. Then he bent down and kissed me. It took about a half a second for my arms to go around his waist and his tongue to slide into my mouth. He kissed soft. I wanted to run my fingers through his hair and find out how broad his chest was and if his butt was really as high and round as it looked in his pants ... oh, hell. I gently pushed back.\\n\\n \"Bad timing,\" I said. I flushed, realizing that with my dress half unzipped, Alcide could see my bra and the tops of my bosom easily. Well, it was good I had a pretty bra on.\\n\\n \"Oh, God,\" he said, having gotten an eyeful. He made a supreme effort and squeezed those green eyes shut. \"Bad timing,\" he agreed again. \"Though I can hope that, real soon, it might seem like better timing.\"\\n\\n I smiled. \"Who knows?\" I said, and stepped back into my room while I could still make myself move in that direction. After shutting the door gently, I hung up the red dress, pleased it still looked good and unstained. The sleeves were a disaster, with greasy fingerprints and a little blood on them. I sighed regretfully.\\n\\n I\u0027d have to flit from door to door to use the bathroom. I didn\u0027t want to be a tease, and my robe was definitely short, nylon, and pink. So I scooted, because I could hear Alcide rummaging around in the kitchen. What with one thing and another, I was in the little bathroom for a while. When I came out, all the lights in the apartment were off except the one in my bedroom. I closed the shades, feeling a little silly doing so since no other building on the block was five stories high. I put on my pink nightgown, and crawled in the bed to read a chapter of my romance by way of calming down. It was the one where the heroine finally beds the hero, so it didn\u0027t work too well, but I did stop thinking about the biker\u0027s skin burning from contact with the goblin, and about Debbie\u0027s malicious narrow face. And about the idea of Bill being tortured.\\n\\n The love scene (actually, the sex scene) steered my mind more toward Alcide\u0027s warm mouth.\\n\\n I switched off the bedside lamp after I\u0027d put my bookmark in my book. I snuggled down in the bed and piled the covers high on top of me, and felt - finally - warm and safe.\\n\\n Someone knocked at my window.\\n\\n I let out a little shriek. Then, figuring who it must be, I yanked on my robe, belted it, and opened the shades.\\n\\n Sure enough, Eric was floating just outside. I switched on the lamp again, and struggled with the unfamiliar window.\\n\\n \"What the hell do you want?\" I was saying, as Alcide dashed into the room.\\n\\n I barely spared him a glance over my shoulder. \"You better leave me alone and let me get some sleep,\" I told Eric, not caring if I sounded like an old scold, \"and you better stop showing up outside places in the middle of the night and expecting me to let you in!\"\\n\\n \"Sookie, let me in,\" Eric said.\\n\\n \"No! Well, actually, this is Alcide\u0027s place. Alcide, what you want to do?\"\\n\\n I turned to look at him for the first time, and tried not to let my mouth fall open. Alcide slept in those long drawstring pants, period. Whoa. If he\u0027d been shirtless thirty minutes before, the timing might have seemed just perfect.\\n\\n \"What do you want, Eric?\" Alcide asked, much more calmly than I had done.\\n\\n \"We need to talk,\" Eric said, sounding impatient.\\n\\n \"If I let him in now, can I rescind it?\" Alcide asked me.\\n\\n \"Sure.\" I grinned at Eric. \"Any moment, you can rescind it.\"\\n\\n \"Okay. You can come in, Eric.\" Alcide took the screen off the window, and Eric slid in feetfirst. I eased the window shut behind him. Now I was cold again. There was gooseflesh all over Alcide\u0027s chest, too, and his nipples ... I forced myself to keep an eye on Eric.\\n\\n Eric gave both of us a sharp look, his blue eyes as brilliant as sapphires in the lamplight. \"What have you found out, Sookie?\"\\n\\n \"The vampires here do have him.\"\\n\\n Eric\u0027s eyes may have widened a little, but that was his only reaction. He appeared to be thinking intently.\\n\\n \"Isn\u0027t it a little dangerous for you to be on Edgington\u0027s turf, unannounced?\" Alcide asked. He was doing his leaning-against-the-wall thing again. He and Eric were both big men and the room really seemed crowded all of a sudden. Maybe their egos were using up all the oxygen.\\n\\n \"Oh, yes,\" Eric said. \"Very dangerous.\" He smiled radiantly.\\n\\n I wondered if they\u0027d notice if I went back to bed. I yawned. Two pairs of eyes swung to focus on me. \"Anything else you need, Eric?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"Do you have anything else to report?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, they\u0027ve tortured him.\"\\n\\n \"Then they won\u0027t let him go.\"\\n\\n Of course not. You wouldn\u0027t let loose a vampire you\u0027d tortured. You\u0027d be looking over your shoulder for the rest of your life. I hadn\u0027t thought that through, but I could see its truth.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re going to attack?\" I wanted to be nowhere around Jackson when that happened.\\n\\n \"Let me think on it,\" Eric said. \"You are going back to the bar tomorrow night?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, Russell invited us specifically.\"\\n\\n \"Sookie attracted his attention tonight,\" Alcide said.\\n\\n \"But that\u0027s perfect!\" Eric said. \"Tomorrow night, sit with the Edgington crew and pick their brains, Sookie.\"\\n\\n \"Well, that would never have occurred to me, Eric,\" I said, wonderingly. \"Gosh, I\u0027m glad you woke me up tonight to explain that to me.\"\\n\\n \"No problem,\" Eric said. \"Anytime you want me to wake you up, Sookie, you have only to say.\"\\n\\n I sighed. \"Go away, Eric. Good night again, Alcide.\"\\n\\n Alcide straightened, waiting for Eric to go back out the window. Eric waited for Alcide to leave.\\n\\n \"I rescind your invitation into my apartment,\" Alcide said, and abruptly Eric walked to the window, reopened it, and launched himself out. He was scowling. Once outside, he regained his composure and smiled at us, waving as he vanished downward.\\n\\n Alcide slammed the window shut and let the blinds back down.\\n\\n \"No, there are lots of men who don\u0027t like me at all,\" I told him. He\u0027d been easy to read that time, all right.\\n\\n He gave me an odd look. \"Is that so?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, it is.\"\\n\\n \"If you say so.\"\\n\\n \"Most people, regular people, that is ... they think I\u0027m nuts.\"\\n\\n \"Is that right?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, that\u0027s right! And it makes them very nervous to have me serve them.\"\\n\\n He began laughing, a reaction that was so far from what I had intended that I had no idea what to say next.\\n\\n He left the room, still more or less chuckling to himself.\\n\\n Well, that had been weird. I turned out the lamp and took off the robe, tossing it across the foot of the bed. I snuggled between the sheets again, the blanket and spread pulled up to my chin. It was cold and bleak outside, but here I was, finally, warm and safe and alone. Really, really alone.\\n\\n The next morning, Alcide was already gone when I got up. Construction and surveying people get going early, naturally, and I was used to sleeping late because of my job at the bar and because I hung around with a vampire. If I wanted to spend time with Bill, it had to be at night, obviously.\\n\\n There was a note propped up on the coffeepot. I had a slight headache since I am not used to alcohol and I\u0027d had two drinks the night before - the headache was not quite a hangover, but I wasn\u0027t my normal cheerful self, either. I squinted at the tiny printing.\\n\\n \"Running errands. Make yourself at home. I\u0027ll be back in the afternoon.\"\\n\\n For a minute I felt disappointed and deflated. Then I got a hold of myself. It wasn\u0027t like he\u0027d called me up and scheduled this as a romantic weekend, or like we really knew each other. Alcide had had my company foisted on him. I shrugged, and poured myself a cup of coffee. I made some toast and turned on the news. After I\u0027d watched one cycle of CNN headlines, I decided to shower. I took my time. What else was there to do?\\n\\n I was in danger of experiencing an almost unknown state - boredom.\\n\\n At home, there was always something to do, though it might not be something I particularly enjoyed. If you have a house, there\u0027s always some little job waiting for your attention. And when I was in Bon Temps, there was the library to go to, or the dollar store, or the grocery. Since I\u0027d taken up with Bill, I\u0027d also been running errands for him that could only be done in the daytime when offices were open.\\n\\n As Bill crossed my mind, I was plucking a stray hair from my eyebrow line, leaning over the sink to peer in the bathroom mirror. I had to lay down the tweezers and sit on the edge of the tub. My feelings for Bill were so confused and conflicting, I had no hope of sorting them out anytime soon. But knowing he was in pain, in trouble, and I didn\u0027t know how to find him - that was a lot to bear. I had never supposed that our romance would go smoothly. It was an interspecies relationship, after all. And Bill was a lot older than me. But this aching chasm I felt now that he was gone - that, I hadn\u0027t ever imagined.\\n\\n I pulled on some jeans and a sweater and made my bed. I lined up all my makeup in the bathroom I was using, and hung the towel just so. I would have straightened up Alcide\u0027s room if I hadn\u0027t felt it would be sort of impertinent to handle his things. So I read a few chapters of my book, and then decided I simply could not sit in the apartment any longer.\\n\\n I left a note for Alcide telling him I was taking a walk, and then I rode down in the elevator with a man in casual clothes, lugging a golf bag. I refrained from saying, \"Going to play golf?\" and confined myself to mentioning that it was a good day to be outside. It was bright and sunny, clear as a bell, and probably in the fifties. It was a happy day, with all the Christmas decorations looking bright in the sun, and lots of shopping traffic.\\n\\n I wondered if Bill would be home for Christmas. I wondered if Bill could go to church with me on Christmas Eve, or if he would. I thought of the new Skil saw I\u0027d gotten Jason; I\u0027d had it on layaway at Sears in Monroe for months, and just picked it up a week ago. I had gotten a toy for each of Arlene\u0027s kids, and a sweater for Arlene. I really didn\u0027t have anyone else to buy a gift for, and that was pathetic. I decided I\u0027d get Sam a CD this year. The idea cheered me. I love to give presents. This would have been my first Christmas with a boyfriend ...\\n\\n Oh, hell, I\u0027d come full cycle, just like Headline News.\\n\\n \"Sookie!\" called a voice.\\n\\n Startled out of my dreary round of thoughts, I looked around to see that Janice was waving at me out of the door of her shop, on the other side of the street. I\u0027d unconsciously walked the direction I knew. I waved back at her.\\n\\n \"Come on over!\" she said.\\n\\n I went down to the corner and crossed with the light. The shop was busy, and Jarvis and Corinne had their hands full with customers.\\n\\n \"Christmas parties tonight,\" Janice explained, while her hands were busy rolling up a young matron\u0027s black shoulder-length hair. \"We\u0027re not usually open after noon on Saturdays.\" The young woman, whose hands were decorated with an impressive set of diamond rings, kept riffling through a copy of Southern Living while Janice worked on her head.\\n\\n \"Does this sound good?\" she asked Janice. \"Ginger meatballs?\" One glowing fingernail pointed to the recipe.\\n\\n \"Kind of oriental?\" Janice asked.\\n\\n \"Um, sort of.\" She read the recipe intently. \"No one else would be serving them,\" she muttered. \"You could stick toothpicks in \u0027em.\"\\n\\n \"Sookie, what are you doing today?\" Janice asked, when she was sure her customer was thinking about ground beef.\\n\\n \"Just hanging out,\" I said. I shrugged. \"Your brother\u0027s out running errands, his note said.\"\\n\\n \"He left you a note to tell you what he was doing? Girl, you should be proud. That man hasn\u0027t set pen to paper since high school.\" She gave me a sideways look and grinned. \"You all have a good time last night?\"\\n\\n I thought it over. \"Ah, it was okay,\" I said hesitantly. The dancing had been fun, anyway.\\n\\n Janice burst out laughing. \"If you have to think about it that hard, it must not have been a perfect evening.\"\\n\\n \"Well, no,\" I admitted. \"There was like a little fight in the bar, and a man had to be evicted. And then, Debbie was there.\"\\n\\n \"How did her engagement party go?\"\\n\\n \"There was quite a crowd at her table,\" I said. \"But she came over after a while and asked a lot of questions.\" I smiled reminiscently. \"She sure didn\u0027t like seeing Alcide with someone else!\"\\n\\n Janice laughed again.\\n\\n \"Who got engaged?\" asked her customer, having decided against the recipe.\\n\\n \"Oh, Debbie Pelt? Used to go with my brother?\" Janice said.\\n\\n \"I know her,\" said the black-haired woman, pleasure in her voice. \"She used to date your brother, Alcide? And now she\u0027s marrying someone else?\"\\n\\n \"Marrying Charles Clausen,\" Janice said, nodding gravely. \"You know him?\"\\n\\n \"Sure I do! We went to high school together. He\u0027s marrying Debbie Pelt? Well, better him than your brother,\" Black Hair said confidentially.\\n\\n \"I\u0027d already figured that out,\" Janice said. \"You know something I don\u0027t know, though?\"\\n\\n \"That Debbie, she\u0027s into some weird stuff,\" Black Hair said, raising her eyebrows to mark deep significance.\\n\\n \"Like what?\" I asked, hardly breathing as I waited to hear what would come out. Could it be that this woman actually knew about shape-shifting, about werewolves? My eyes met Janice\u0027s and I saw the same apprehension in them.\\n\\n Janice knew about her brother. She knew about his world.\\n\\n And she knew I did, too.\\n\\n \"Devil worship, they say,\" Black Hair said. \"Witchcraft.\"\\n\\n We both gaped at her reflection in the mirror. She had gotten the reaction she\u0027d been looking for. She gave a satisfied nod. Devil worship and witchcraft weren\u0027t synonymous, but I wasn\u0027t going to argue with this woman; this was the wrong time and place.\\n\\n \"Yes, ma\u0027am, that\u0027s what I hear. At every full moon, she and some friends of hers go out in the woods and do stuff. No one seems to know exactly what,\" she admitted.\\n\\n Janice and I exhaled simultaneously.\\n\\n \"Oh, my goodness,\" I said weakly.\\n\\n \"Then my brother\u0027s well out of a relationship with her. We don\u0027t hold with such doings,\" Janice said righteously.\\n\\n \"Of course not,\" I agreed.\\n\\n We didn\u0027t meet each other\u0027s eyes.\\n\\n After that little passage, I made motions about leaving, but Janice asked me what I was wearing that night.\\n\\n \"Oh, it\u0027s kind of a champagne color,\" I said. \"Kind of a shiny beige.\"\\n\\n \"Then the red nails won\u0027t do,\" Janice said. \"Corinne!\"\\n\\n Despite all my protests, I left the shop with bronze finger- and toenails, and Jarvis worked on my hair again. I tried to pay Janice, but the most she would let me do was tip her employees.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve never been pampered so much in my life,\" I told her.\\n\\n \"What do you do, Sookie?\" Somehow that hadn\u0027t come up the day before.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m a barmaid,\" I said.\\n\\n \"That is a change from Debbie,\" Janice said. She looked thoughtful.\\n\\n \"Oh, yeah? What does Debbie do?\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s a legal assistant.\"\\n\\n Debbie definitely had an educational edge. I\u0027d never been able to manage college; financially, it would have been rough, though I could\u0027ve found a way, I guess. But my disability had made it hard enough to get out of high school. A telepathic teenager has an extremely hard time of it, let me tell you. And I had so little control then. Every day had been full of dramas - the dramas of other kids. Trying to concentrate on listening in class, taking tests in a roomful of buzzing brains ... the only thing I\u0027d ever excelled in was homework.\\n\\n Janice didn\u0027t seem to be too concerned that I was a barmaid, which was an occupation not guaranteed to impress the families of those you dated.\\n\\n I had to remind myself all over again that this setup with Alcide was a temporary arrangement he\u0027d never asked for, and that after I\u0027d discovered Bill\u0027s whereabouts - right, Sookie, remember Bill, your boyfriend? - I\u0027d never see Alcide again. Oh, he might drop into Merlotte\u0027s, if he felt like getting off the interstate on his way from Shreveport to Jackson, but that would be all.\\n\\n Janice was genuinely hoping I would be a permanent member of her family. That was so nice of her. I liked her a lot. I almost found myself wishing that Alcide really liked me, that there was a real chance of Janice being my sister-in-law.\\n\\n They say there\u0027s no harm in daydreaming, but there is. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/club-dead-sookie-stackhouse-3/page-6.html","bookId":2193,"book":{"id":2193,"title":"Club Dead (Sookie Stackhouse #3)","description":"Storyline: Club Dead (Sookie Stackhouse #3) \\n Things between cocktail waitress Sookie and her vampire boyfriend Bill seem to be going excellently (apart from the small matter of him being undead) until he leaves town for a while.
