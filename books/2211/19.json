{"id":102379,"no":19,"title":"Page 19","content":"Daniel\n They had reached the doors, and now had to push the last few feet down a narrow ramp into the giant open oval of the main floor.\n The crowd loosened, like marbles rolling in all directions. Daniel moved towards the center, his fingers hooked around Armand\u0027s belt so as not to lose him, his eyes roaming over the horseshoe-shaped theater, the high banks of seats rising to the ceiling. Mortals everywhere swarmed the cement stairs, or hung over iron railings, or flowed into the milling crowd around him.\n A blur it was suddenly, the noise of it like the low grind of a giant machine. But then in the moment of deliberately distorted vision, he saw the others. He saw the simple, inescapable difference between the living and the dead. Beings like himself in every direction, concealed in the mortal forest, yet shining like the eyes of an owl in the light of the moon. No paint or dark glasses or shapeless hats or hooded capes could ever conceivably hide them from each other. And it wasn\u0027t merely the unearthly sheen to their faces or hands. It was the slow, lissome grace of their movements, as if they were more spirit than flesh.\n Ah, my brothers and sisters, at last!\n But it was hatred he felt around him. A rather dishonest hatred! They loved Lestat and condemned him simultaneously. They loved the very act of hating, punishing. Suddenly, he caught the eye of a powerful hulking creature with greasy black hair who bared his fangs in an ugly flash and then revealed the plan in stunning completeness. Beyond the prying eyes of mortals, they would hack Lestat\u0027s limbs from his body; they would sever his head; then the remains would be burnt on a pyre by the sea. The end of the monster and his legend. Are you with us or against us?\n Daniel laughed out loud. \"You\u0027ll never kill him,\" Daniel said. Yet he gaped as he glimpsed the sharpened scythe the creature held against his chest inside his coat. Then the beast turned and vanished. Daniel gazed upwards through the smoky light. One of them now. Know all their secrets! He felt giddy, on the verge of madness.\n Armand\u0027s hand closed on his shoulder. They had come to the very center of the main floor. The crowd was getting denser by the second. Pretty girls in black silk gowns shoved and pushed against the crude bikers in their worn black leather. Soft feathers brushed his cheek; he saw a red devil with giant horns; a bony skeleton face topped with golden curls and pearl combs. Random cries rose in the bluish gloom. The bikers howled like wolves; someone shouted \"Lestat\" in a deafening voice, and others took up the call instantly.\n Armand again had the lost expression, the expression that belonged to deep concentration, as if what he saw before him meant nothing at all.\n \"Thirty perhaps,\" he whispered in Daniel\u0027s ear, \"no more than that, and one or two so old they could destroy the rest of us in an instant.\"\n \"Where, tell me where?\"\n \"Listen,\" Armand said. \"And see for yourself. There is no hiding from them.\"\n Khayman\n Maharet\u0027s child. Jessica. The thought caught Khayman off guard. Protect Maharet\u0027s child. Somehow escape from here.\n He roused himself, senses sharpened. He\u0027d been listening to Marius again, Marius trying to reach the young untuned ears of the Vampire Lestat, who preened backstage, before a broken mirror. What could this mean, Maharet\u0027s child, Jessica, and when the thoughts pertained, without doubt, to a mortal woman?\n It came again, the unexpected communication of some strong yet unveiled mind: Take care of Jesse. Somehow stop the Mother .... But there were no words really-it was no more than a shining glimpse into another\u0027s soul, a sparkling overflow.\n Khayman\u0027s eyes moved slowly over the balconies opposite, over the swarming main floor. Far away in some remote corner of the city, an old one wandered, full of fear of the Queen yet longing to look upon her face. He had come here to die, but to know her face in the final instant.\n Khayman closed his eyes to shut this out.\n Then he heard it again suddenly. Jessica, my Jessica. And behind the soulful call, the knowledge of Maharet! The sudden vision of Maharet, enshrined in love, and ancient and white as he himself was. It was a moment of stunning pain. He slumped back in the wooden seat and bowed his head just a little. Then he looked out again over the steel rafters, the ugly tangles of black wire and rusted cylindrical lights. Where are you?\n There, far away against the opposite wall, he saw the figure from whom the thoughts were coming. Ah, the oldest he had seen so far. A giant Nordic blood drinker, seasoned and cunning, dressed in coarse brown rawhide garments, with flowing straw-colored hair, his heavy brows and small deep-set eyes giving him a brooding expression.\n The being was tracking a small mortal woman who fought her way through the crowds of the main floor. Jesse, Maharet\u0027s mortal daughter.\n Maddened, disbelieving, Khayman focused tightly on the small woman. He felt his eyes mist with tears as he saw the astonishing resemblance. Here was Maharet\u0027s long coppery red hair, curling, thick, and the same tall birdlike frame, the same clever and curious green eyes, sweeping the scene as the female let herself be turned around and around by those who pushed against her.\n Maharet\u0027s profile. Maharet\u0027s skin, which had been so pale and almost luminous in life, so like the inner lining of a seashell.\n In a sudden vivid memory, he saw Maharet\u0027s skin through the mesh of his own dark fingers. As he had pushed her face to the side during the rape, his fingertips had touched the delicate folds of flesh over her eyes. Not till a year later had they plucked out her eyes and he had been there remembering the moment, the feel of the flesh. That is before he had picked up the eyes themselves and ....\n He shuddered. He felt a sharp pain in his lungs. His memory wasn\u0027t going to fail him. He would not slip away from this moment, the happy clown remembering nothing.\n Maharet\u0027s child, all right. But how? Through how many generations had these characteristics survived to flower again in this small female who appeared to be fighting her way towards the stage at the end of the hall?\n It was not impossible, of course. He quickly realized it. Perhaps three hundred ancestors stood between this twentieth-century woman and the long ago afternoon when he had put on the King\u0027s medallion and stepped down from the dais to commit the King\u0027s rape. Maybe even less than that. A mere fraction of this crowd, to put it more neatly in perspective.\n But more astonishing than this, that Maharet knew her own descendants. And know this woman Maharet did. The tall blood drinker\u0027s mind yielded that fact immediately.\n He scanned the tall Nordic one. Maharet, alive. Maharet, the guardian of her mortal family. Maharet, the embodiment of illimitable strength and will. Maharet who had given him, this blond servant, no explanation of the dreams of the twins, but had sent him here instead to do her bidding: save Jessica.\n Ah, but she lives, Khayman thought. She lives, and if she lives then in a real way, they both live, the red-haired sisters!\n Khayman studied the creature even more intently, probing even deeper. But all he caught now was the fierce protectiveness.\n Rescue Jesse, not merely from the danger of the Mother but from this place altogether, where Jesse\u0027s eyes would see what no one could ever explain away.\n And how he loathed the Mother, this tall, fair being with the posture of a warrior and a priest in one. He loathed that the Mother had disrupted the serenity of his timeless and melancholy existence; loathed that his sad, sweet love for this woman, Jessica, exacerbated the alarm he felt for himself. He knew the extent of the destruction too, that every blood drinker from one end of this continent to the other had been destroyed, save for a precious few, most of whom were under this roof, never dreaming of the fate that threatened them.\n He knew as well of the dreams of the twins, but he did not understand them. After all, two redheaded sisters he had never known; only one red-haired beauty ruled his life. And once again Khayman saw Maharet\u0027s face, a vagrant image of softened weary human eyes peering from a porcelain mask: Mael, do not ask me anything more. But do as I tell you.\n Silence. The blood drinker was aware of the surveillance suddenly. With a little jerk of his head he looked around the hall, trying to spot the intruder.\n The name had done it, as names so often do. The creature had felt himself known, recognized. And Khayman had recognized the name at once, connecting it with the Mael of Lestat\u0027s pages. Undoubtedly they were one and the same-this was the Druid priest who had lured Marius into the sacred grove where the blood god had made him one of its own, and sent him off to Egypt to find the Mother and the Father.\n Yes, this was the same Mael. And the creature felt himself recognized and hated it.\n After the initial spasm of rage, all thought and emotion vanished. A rather dizzying display of strength, Khayman conceded. He relaxed in the chair. But the creature couldn\u0027t find him. Two dozen other white faces he picked out of the crowd, but not Khayman.\n Intrepid Jessica had meantime reached her destination. Ducking low, she\u0027d slipped through the heavy-muscled motorcycle riders who claimed, the space before the stage as their own, and had risen to take hold of the lip of the wooden platform.\n Flash of her silver bracelet in the light. And that might as well have been a tiny dagger to the mental shield of Mael, because his love and his thoughts were wholly visible again for one fluid instant.\n This one is going to die, too, if he doesn\u0027t become wise, Khayman thought. He\u0027d been schooled by Maharet, no doubt, and perhaps nourished by her powerful blood; yet his heart was undisciplined, and his temper beyond his control, it was obvious.\n Then some feet behind Jesse, in the swirling color and noise, Khayman spied another intriguing figure, much younger, yet almost as powerful in his own fashion as the Gaul, Mael.\n Khayman sought for the name, but the creature\u0027s mind was a perfect blank; not so much as a glimmer of personality escaped from it. A boy he\u0027d been when he died, with straight dark auburn hair, and eyes a little too big for his face. But it was easy, suddenly, to filch the being\u0027s name from Daniel, his newborn fledgling who stood beside him. Armand. And the fledgling, Daniel, was scarcely dead. All the tiny molecules of his body were dancing with the demon\u0027s invisible chemistry.\n Armand immediately attracted Khayman. Surely he was the same Armand of whom Louis and Lestat had both written-the immortal with the form of a youth. And this meant that he was no more than five hundred years old, yet he veiled himself completely. Shrewd, cold he seemed, yet without flair-a stance that required no room in which to display itself. And now, sensing infallibly that he was watched, he turned his large soft brown eyes upward and fixed instantly upon the remote figure of Khayman.\n \"No harm meant to you or your young one,\" Khayman whispered, so that his lips might shape and control the thoughts. \"No friend to the Mother,\"\n Armand heard but gave no answer. Whatever terror he felt at the sight of one so old, he masked completely. One would have thought he was looking at the wall behind Khayman\u0027s head, at the steady stream of laughing and shouting children who poured down the steps from the topmost doorways.\n And, quite inevitably, this oddly beguiling little five-hundred-year-old being fixed his eyes upon Mael as the gaunt one felt another irresistible surge of concern for his fragile Jesse.\n Khayman understood this being, Armand. He felt he understood him and liked him completely. As their eyes met again, alt that had been written of this creature in the two little histories was informed and balanced by the creature\u0027s innate simplicity. The loneliness which Khayman had felt in Athens was now very strong.\n \"Not unlike my own simple soul,\" Khayman whispered. \"You\u0027re lost in all this because you know the terrain too well. And that no matter how far you walk, you come again to the same mountains, the same valley.\"\n No response. Of course. Khayman shrugged and smiled. To this one he\u0027d give anything that he could; and guilelessly, he let Armand know it.\n Now the question was, how to help them, these two that might have some hope of sleeping the immortal sleep until another sunset. And most important of all, how to reach Maharet, to whom the fierce and distrusting Mael was unstintingly devoted.\n To Armand, Khayman said with the slightest movement of his lips: \"No friend of the Mother. I told you. And keep with the mortal crowd. She\u0027ll pick you out when you step apart. It\u0027s that simple.\"\n Armand\u0027s face registered no change. Beside him, the fledgling Daniel was happy, glorying in the pageant that surrounded him. He knew no fear, no plans or dreams. And why not? He had this extremely powerful creature to take care of him. He was a damn sight luckier than the rest,\n Khayman rose to his feet. It was the loneliness as much as anything else. He would be near to one of these two, Armand or Mael. That\u0027s what he had wanted in Athens when all this glorious remembering and knowing had begun. To be near another like himself. To speak, to touch . . . something.\n He moved along the top aisle of the hall, which circled the entire room, save for a margin at the far end behind the stage which belonged to the giant video screen.\n He moved with slow human grace, careful not to crush the mortals who pushed against him. And also he wanted this slow progress because he must give Mael the opportunity to see him.\n He knew instinctively that if he snuck up on this proud and quarrelsome thing, the insult would never be borne. And so he proceeded, only picking up his pace when he realized Mael was now aware of his approach.\n Mael couldn\u0027t hide his fear as Armand could. Mael had never seen a blood drinker of Khayman\u0027s age save for Maharet; he was gazing at a potential enemy. Khayman sent the same warm greeting he had sent to Armand-Armand who watched-but nothing in the old warrior\u0027s stance changed.\n The auditorium was now full and locked; outside children screamed and beat upon the doors. Khayman heard the whine and belch of the police radios.\n The Vampire Lestat and his cohorts stood spying upon the hall through the holes in a great serge curtain.\n Lestat embraced his companion Louis, and they kissed on the mouth, as the mortal musicians put their arms around both of them.\n Khayman paused to feel the passion of the crowd, the very air charged with it.\n Jessica had rested her arms on the edge of the platform. She had rested her chin upon the back of her hands. The men behind her, hulking creatures clothed in shiny black leather, shoved her brutally, out of carelessness and drunken exuberance, but they couldn\u0027t dislodge her.\n Neither could Mael, should he make the attempt.\n And something else came clear to Khayman suddenly, as he looked down at her. It was the single word Talamasca. This woman belonged to them; she was part of the order.\n Not possible, he thought again, then laughed silently at his own foolish innocence. This was a night of shocks, was it not? Yet it seemed quite incredible that the Talamasca should have survived from the time he had known it centuries before, when he had played with its members and tormented them, and then turned his back on them out of pity for their fatal combination of innocence and ignorance.\n Ah, memory was too ghastly a thing. Let his past lives slip into oblivion! He could see the faces of those vagabonds, those secular monks of the Talamasca who had so clumsily pursued him across Europe, recording glimpses of him in great leather-bound books, their quill pens scratching late into the night. Benjamin had been his name in that brief respite of consciousness, and Benjamin the Devil they had labeled him in their fancy Latin script, sending off crackling parchment epistles with big sloppy wax seals to their superiors in Amsterdam.\n It had been a game to him, to steal their letters and add his notes to them; to frighten them; to crawl out from under their beds in the night and grab them by the throats and shake them; it had been fun; and what was not? When the fun stopped, he\u0027d always lost his memory again.\n But he had loved them; not exorcists they, or witch-hunting priests, or sorcerers who hoped to chain and control his power. It had even occurred to him once that when it came time to sleep, he would choose the vaults beneath their moldy Motherhouse. For all their meddlesome curiosity, they would never have betrayed him.\n And now to think that the order had survived, with the tenacity of the Church of Rome, and this pretty mortal woman with the shining bracelet on her arm, beloved of Maharet and Mael, was one of their special breed. No wonder she had fought her way to the front ranks, as if to the bottom step of the altar.\n Khayman drew closer to Mael, but he stopped short of him by several feet, the crowd passing ceaselessly in front of them. This he did out of respect for Mael\u0027s apprehension, and the shame the creature felt for being afraid. It was Mael who approached and stood at Khayman\u0027s side.\n The restless crowd passed them as if they were the wall itself. Mael leant close to Khayman, which in its own way was a greeting, an offering of trust. He looked out over the hall, where no empty seat was visible, and the main floor was a mosaic of flashing colors and glistening hair and tiny upthrust fists. Then he reached out and touched Khayman as if he couldn\u0027t prevent himself from doing it. With his fingertips he touched the back of Khayman\u0027s left hand. And Khayman remained still to allow this little exploration.\n How many times had Khayman seen such a gesture between immortals, the young one verifying for himself the texture and hardness of the elder\u0027s flesh. Hadn\u0027t some Christian saint slipped his hand in Christ\u0027s wounds because the sight of them had not been sufficient? More mundane comparisons made Khayman smile. It was like two fierce dogs tentatively examining each other.\n Far below, Armand remained impassive as he kept his eyes upon the two figures. Surely he saw Mael\u0027s sudden disdainful glance, but he did not acknowledge it. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-queen-of-the-damned-the-vampire-chronicles-3/page-19.html","bookId":2211,"book":{"id":2211,"title":"The Queen Of The Damned (The Vampire Chronicles #3)","description":"Storyline: \n The Queen of the Damned (The Vampire Chronicles #3) \n The Queen of the Damned is the third novel of Anne Rice\u0027s The Vampire Chronicles series.
