{"id":102393,"no":34,"title":"Page 34","content":"\"But Lestat, that is just the point; they would never obey. Will you obey? They would die first, as you would die. They would have another reason for rebellion, as if any were ever wanting. They would gather together in magnificent resistance. Imagine a goddess to fight. We shall see enough of that by and by as it is. They cannot help but be men. And I could rule only through tyranny, by endless killing. And there would be chaos. But this way, there shall be a break in the great chain of violence. There shall be an era of utter and perfect peace.\"\\n\\n I was quiet again. I could think of a thousand answers but they were all short-circuited. She knew her purpose only too well. And the truth was, she was right in many things she said.\\n\\n Ah, but it was fantasy! A world without males. What exactly would have been accomplished? Oh, no. No, don\u0027t even accept the idea for a moment. Don\u0027t even. . . . Yet the vision returned, the vision I\u0027d glimpsed in that miserable jungle village, of a world without fear.\\n\\n Imagine trying to explain to them what men had been like. Imagine trying to explain that there had been a time when one could be murdered in the streets of the cities; imagine trying to explain what rape meant to the male of the species . . . imagine. And I saw their eyes looking at me, the uncomprehending eyes as they tried to fathom it, tried to make that leap of understanding. I felt their soft hands touching me.\\n\\n \"But this is madness!\" I whispered.\\n\\n \"Ah, but you fight me so hard, my prince,\" she whispered. There was a flash of anger, hurt. She came near to me. If she kissed me again I was going to start weeping. I\u0027d thought I knew what beauty was in women; but she\u0027d surpassed all the language I had for it.\\n\\n \"My prince,\" she said again in a low whisper. \"The logic of it is elegant. A world in which only a handful of males are kept for breeding shall be a female world. And that world will be what we have never known in all our bloody miserable history, in which men now breed germs in vials with which to kill continents in chemical warfare, and design bombs which can knock the earth from its path around the sun.\"\\n\\n \"What if the women divide along principles of masculine and feminine, the way men so often divide if there are no females there?\"\\n\\n \"You know that\u0027s a foolish objection. Such distinctions are never more than superficial. Women are women! Can you conceive of war made by women? Truly, answer me. Can you? Can you conceive of bands of roving women intent only on destruction? Or rape? Such a thing is preposterous. For the aberrant few justice will be immediate. But overall, something utterly unforeseen will take place. Don\u0027t you see? The possibility of peace on earth has always existed, and there have always been people who could realize it, and preserve it, and those people are women. If one takes away the men.\"\\n\\n I sat down on the bed in consternation, like a mortal man. I put my elbows on my knees. Dear God, dear God! Why did those two words keep coming to me? There was no God! I was in the room with God.\\n\\n She laughed triumphantly.\\n\\n \"Yes, precious one,\" she said. She touched my hand and turned me around and drew me towards her. \"But tell me, doesn\u0027t it excite you even a little?\"\\n\\n I looked at her. \"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n \"You, the impulsive one. You who made that child, Claudia, into a blood drinker, just to see what would happen?\" There was mockery in her tone but it was affectionate. \"Come now, don\u0027t you want to see what will happen if all the males are gone? Aren\u0027t you even a little curious? Reach into your soul for the truth. It is a very interesting idea, isn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t answer. Then I shook my head. \"No,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Coward,\" she whispered.\\n\\n No one had ever called me that, no one.\\n\\n \"Coward,\" she said again. \"Little being with little dreams.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe there would be no war and no rape and no violence,\" I said, \"if all beings were little and had little dreams, as you put it.\"\\n\\n She laughed softly. Forgivingly.\\n\\n \"We could argue these points forever,\" she whispered. \"But very soon we will know. The world will be as I would have it be; and we shall see what happens as I said.\"\\n\\n She sat beside me. For a moment it seemed I was losing my mind. She slipped her smooth naked arms around my neck. It seemed there had never been a softer female body, never anything as yielding and luscious as her embrace. Yet she was so hard, so strong.\\n\\n The lights in the room were dimming. And the sky outside seemed ever more vivid and darkly blue.\\n\\n \"Akasha,\" I whispered. I was looking beyond the open terrace at the stars. I wanted to say something, something crucial that would sweep away all arguments; but the meaning escaped me. I was so drowsy; surely it was her doing. It was a spell she was working, yet knowing it did not release me. I felt her lips again on my lips, and on my throat. I felt the cool satin of her skin.\\n\\n \"Yes, rest now, precious one. And when you wake, the victims will be waiting.\"\\n\\n \"Victims. . . .\" Almost dreaming, as I held her in my arms.\\n\\n \"But you must sleep now. You are young still and fragile. My blood\u0027s working on you, changing you, perfecting you.\"\\n\\n Yes, destroying me; destroying my heart and my will. I was vaguely conscious of moving, of lying down on the bed. I fell back into the silken pillows, and then there was the silk of her hair near me, the touch of her fingers, and again, her lips on my mouth. Blood in her kiss; blood thundering beneath it,\\n\\n \"Listen to the sea,\" she whispered. \"Listen to the flowers open. You can hear them now, you know. You can hear the tiny creatures of the sea if you listen. You can hear the dolphins sing, for they do.\" Drifting. Safe in her arms; she the powerful one; she was the one they all feared.\\n\\n Forget the acrid smell of the burning bodies; yes, listen to the sea pounding like guns on the beach beneath us; listen to the sound of a rose petal breaking loose and falling onto marble. And the world is going to hell, and I cannot help it, and I am in her arms and I am going to sleep.\\n\\n \"Hasn\u0027t that happened a million times, my love?\" she whispered. \"On a world full of suffering and death, you turned your back as millions of mortals do every night?\"\\n\\n Darkness. Splendid visions taking place; a palace even more lovely than this. Victims. Servants. The mythical existence of pashas, and emperors.\\n\\n \"Yes, my darling, anything that you desire, All the world at your feet. I shall build you palace upon palace; they shall do it; they that worship you. That is nothing. That is the simplest part of it. And think of the hunting, my prince. Until the killing is done, think of the chase. For they would surely run from you and hide from you, yet you would find them.\"\\n\\n In the dwindling light-just before dreams come-I could see it. I could see myself traveling through the air, like the heroes of old, over the sprawling country where their campfires flickered.\\n\\n In packs like wolves they would travel, through the cities as well as the woods, daring to show themselves only by day; for only then would they be safe from us. When night fell, we would come; and we would track them by their thoughts and by their blood, and by the whispered confessions of the women who had seen them and maybe even harbored them. Out in the open they might run, firing their useless weapons. And we would swoop down; we would destroy them one by one, our prey, save for those we wanted alive, those whose blood we would take slowly, mercilessly.\\n\\n And out of that war shall come peace? Out of that hideous game shall come a garden?\\n\\n I tried to open my eyes. I felt her kiss my eyelids.\\n\\n Dreaming.\\n\\n A barren plain and the soil breaking. Something rising, pushing the dried clods of earth out of its way. I am this thing. This thing walking across the barren plain as the sun sinks. The sky is still full of tight. I look down at the stained cloth that covers me, but this is not me. I\u0027m only Lestat. And I\u0027m afraid. I wish Gabrielle were here. And Louis. Maybe Louis could make her understand. Ah, Louis, of all of us, Louis who always knew. . . .\\n\\n And there is the familiar dream again, the redheaded women kneeling by the altar with the body-their mother\u0027s body and they are ready to consume it. Yes, it\u0027s their duty, their sacred right-to devour the brain and the heart. Except that they never will because something awful always happens. Soldiers come. ... I wish I knew the meaning.\\n\\n Blood. I woke up with a start. Hours had passed. The room had cooled faintly. The sky was wondrously clear through the open windows.\\n\\n From her came all the light that filled the room. \"The women are waiting, and the victims, they are afraid.\" The victims. My head was spinning. The victims would be full of luscious blood. Males who would have died anyway. Young males all mine to take.\\n\\n \"Yes. But come, put an end to their suffering.\" Groggily I got up. She wrapped a long cloak over my shoulders, something simpler than her own garment, but warm and soft to touch. She stroked my hair with her two hands.\\n\\n \"Masculine-feminine. Is that all there ever was to it?\" I whispered. My body wanted to sleep some more. But the blood.\\n\\n She reached up and touched my cheek with her fingers. Tears again?\\n\\n We went out of the room together, and onto a long landing with a marble railing, from which a stairs descended, turning once, into an immense room. Candelabra everywhere. Dim electric lamps creating a luxurious gloom.\\n\\n At the very center, the women were assembled, perhaps two hundred or more of them, standing motionless and looking up at us, their hands clasped as if in prayer.\\n\\n Even in their silence, they seemed barbaric, amid the European furniture, the Italian hardwoods with their gilt edges, and the old fireplace with its marble scrolls. I thought of her words suddenly: \"history doesn\u0027t matter; art doesn\u0027t matter.\" Dizzy. On the walls, there ran those airy eighteenth-century paintings, full of gleaming clouds and fat-cheeked angels, and skies of luminescent blue.\\n\\n The women stood looking past this wealth which had never touched them and indeed meant nothing to them, looking up at the vision on the landing, which now dissolved, and in a rush of whispered noise and colored light, materialized suddenly at the foot of the stairs.\\n\\n Sighs rose, hands were raised to shield bowed heads as if from a blast of unwelcome light. Then all eyes were fixed upon the Queen of Heaven and her consort, who stood on the red carpet, only a few feet above the assembly, the consort a bit shaken and biting his lip a little and trying to see this thing clearly, this awful thing that was happening, this awful mingling of worship and blood sacrifice, as the victims were brought forth.\\n\\n Such fine specimens. Dark-haired, dark-skinned, Mediterranean men. Every bit as beautiful as the young women. Men of that stocky build and exquisite musculature that has inspired artists for thousands of years. Ink black eyes and darkly shaved faces; and deep cunning; and deep anger as they looked upon these hostile supernatural creatures who had decreed the death of their brothers far and wide.\\n\\n With leather straps they\u0027d been bound-probably their own belts, and the belts of dozens of others; but the women had done it well. Their ankles were tethered even, so that they could walk but not kick or run. Naked to the waist they were, and only one was trembling, as much with anger as with fear. Suddenly he began to struggle. The other two turned, stared at him, and started to struggle as well.\\n\\n But the mass of women closed on them, forcing them to their knees. I felt the desire rise in me at the sight of it, at the sight of leather belts cutting into the dark naked flesh of the men\u0027s arms. Why is this so seductive! And the women\u0027s hands holding them, those tight menacing hands that could be so soft otherwise. They couldn\u0027t fight so many women. Heaving sighs, they stopped the rebellion, though the one who had started the struggle looked up, accusingly, at me.\\n\\n Demons, devils, things from hell, that is what his mind told him; for who else could have done such things to his world? Oh, this is the beginning of darkness, terrible darkness!\\n\\n But the desire was so strong. You are going to die and I am going to do it! And he seemed to hear it, and to understand it. And a savage hatred of the women rose out of him, replete with images of rape and retribution that made me smile, and yet I understood. Rather completely I understood. So easy to feel that contempt for them, to be outraged that they had dared to become the enemy, the enemy in the age-old battle, they, the women! And it was darkness, this imagined retribution, it was unspeakable darkness, too.\\n\\n I felt Akasha\u0027s fingers on my arm. The feeling of bliss came back; the delirium. I tried to resist it, but I felt it as before. Yet the desire didn\u0027t go away. The desire was in my mouth now. I could taste it.\\n\\n Yes, pass into the moment; pass into pure function; let the bloody sacrifice begin.\\n\\n The women went down on their knees en masse, and the men who were already kneeling seemed to grow calm, their eyes glazing over as they looked at us, their lips trembling and loose.\\n\\n I stared at the muscled shoulders of the first one, the one who had rebelled. I imagined as I always do at such moments the feel of his coarse rough-shaven throat when my lips would touch it, and my teeth would break through the skin-not the icy skin of the goddess-but hot, salty human skin.\\n\\n Yes, beloved. Take him. He is the sacrifice that you deserve. You are a god now. Take him. Do you know how many wait for you?\\n\\n It seemed the women understood what to do. They lifted him as I stepped forward; there was another struggle, but it was no more than a spasm in the muscles as I took him into my arms.\\n\\n My hand closed too hard on his head; I didn\u0027t know my new strength, and I heard the bones cracking even as my teeth went in. But the death came almost instantly, so great was my first draught of blood. I was burning with hunger; and the whole portion, complete and entire in one instant, had not been enough. Not nearly enough!\\n\\n At once I took the next victim, trying to be slow with it, so that I would tumble into the darkness as I\u0027d so often done, with only the soul speaking to me. Yes, telling me its secrets as the blood spurted into my mouth, as I let my mouth fill before I swallowed. Yes, brother. I am sorry, brother. And then staggering forward, I stepped on the corpse before me and crushed it underfoot.\\n\\n \"Give me the last one.\"\\n\\n No resistance. He stared up at me in utter quiet, as if some light had dawned in him, as if he\u0027d found in theory or belief some perfect rescue. I pulled him to me-gently, Lestat-and this was the real fount I wanted, this was the slow, powerful death I craved, the heart pumping as if it would never stop, the sigh slipping from his lips, my eyes clouded still, even as I let him go, with the fading images of his brief and unrecorded life, suddenly collapsed into one rare second of meaning.\\n\\n I let him drop. Now there was no meaning.\\n\\n There was only the light before me, and the rapture of the women who had at last been redeemed through miracles.\\n\\n The room was hushed; not a thing stirred; the sound of the sea came in, that distant monotonous booming.\\n\\n Then Akasha\u0027s voice:\\n\\n The sins of the men have now been atoned for; and those who are kept now, shall be well cared for, and loved. But never give freedom to those who remain, those who have oppressed you.\\n\\n And then soundlessly, without distinct words, the lesson came.\\n\\n The ravening lust which they had just witnessed, the deaths they had seen at my hands-that was to be the eternal reminder of the fierceness that lived in all male things and must never be allowed free again. The males had been sacrificed to the embodiment of their own violence.\\n\\n In sum, these women had witnessed a new and transcendent ritual; a new holy sacrifice of the Mass. And they would see it again; and they must always remember it.\\n\\n My head swam from the paradox. And my own small designs of not very long ago were there to torment me. I had wanted the world of mortals to know of me. I had wanted to be the image of evil in the theater of the world and thereby somehow do good.\\n\\n And now I was that image all right, I was its literal embodiment, passing through the minds of these few simple souls into myth as she had promised. And there was a small voice whispering in my ear, hammering me with that old adage: be careful what you wish for; your wish might come true.\\n\\n Yes, that was the heart of it; all I\u0027d ever wished for was coming true. In the shrine I had kissed her and longed to awaken her, and dreamt of her power; and now we stood together, she and I, and the hymns rose around us. Hosannas. Cries of joy.\\n\\n The doors of the palazzo were thrown open.\\n\\n And we were taking our leave; we were rising in splendor and in magic, and passing out of the doors, and up over the roof of the old mansion, and then out over the sparkling waters into the calm sweep of the stars,\\n\\n I had no fear of falling anymore; I had no fear of anything so insignificant. Because my whole soul-petty as it was and always had been-knew fears I\u0027d never imagined before. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-queen-of-the-damned-the-vampire-chronicles-3/page-34.html","bookId":2211,"book":{"id":2211,"title":"The Queen Of The Damned (The Vampire Chronicles #3)","description":"Storyline: The Queen of the Damned (The Vampire Chronicles #3) \\n The Queen of the Damned is the third novel of Anne Rice\u0027s The Vampire Chronicles series.
