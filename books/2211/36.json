{"id":102395,"no":36,"title":"Page 36","content":"LESTAT: THE KINGDOM HEAVEN OF THE CARIBBEAN.\n HAITI. THE GARDEN OF GOD.\n I stood on the hilltop in the moonlight and I tried not to see this paradise. I tried to picture those I loved. Were they gathered still together in that fairy-tale wood of monster trees, where I had seen my mother walking? If only I could see their faces or hear their voices. Marius, do not be the angry father. Help me! Help us all! I do not give in, but I am losing. I am losing my soul and my mind. My heart is already gone. It belongs to her.\n But they were beyond my reach; the great sweep of miles closed us off; I had not the power to overarch that distance.\n I looked instead on these verdant green hills, now patched with tiny farms, a picture book world with flowers blooming in profusion, the red poinsettia as tall as trees. And the clouds, ever changing, borne like the tall sailing ships on brisk winds. What had the first Europeans thought when they looked upon this fecund land surrounded by the sparkling sea? That this was the Garden of God?\n And to think, they had brought such death to it, the natives gone within a few short years, destroyed by slavery, disease, and endless cruelty. Not a single blood descendant remains of those peaceful beings who had breathed this balmy air, and plucked the fruit from the trees which ripened all year round, and thought their visitors gods perhaps, who could not but return their kindness.\n Now, below in the streets of Port-au-Prince, riots and death, and not of our making. Merely the unchanging history of this bloody place, where violence has flourished for four hundred years as flowers flourish; though the vision of the hills rising into the mist could break the heart.\n But we had done our work all right, she because she did it, and I because I did nothing to stop it-in the small towns strewn along the winding road that led to this wooded summit. Towns of tiny pastel houses, and banana trees growing wild, and the people so poor, so hungry. Even now the women sang their hymns and, by the light of candles and the burning church, buried the dead.\n We were alone. Far beyond the end of the narrow road; where the forest grew again, hiding the ruins of this old house that had once overlooked the valley like a citadel. Centuries since the planters had left here; centuries since they danced and sang and drank their wine within these shattered rooms while the slaves wept.\n Over the brick walls, the bougainvillea climbed, fluorescent in the light of the moon. And out of the flagstone floor a great tree had risen, hung with moon blossoms, pushing back with its gnarled limbs the last remnants of the old timbers that had once held the roof.\n Ah, to be here forever, and with her. And for the rest to be forgotten. No death, no killing.\n She sighed; she said: \"This is the Kingdom of Heaven.\"\n In the tiny hamlet below, the women had run barefoot after the men with clubs in hand. And the voodoo priest had screamed his ancient curses as they caught him in the graveyard. I had left the scene of the carnage; I\u0027d climbed the mountain alone. Fleeing, angry, unable any longer to bear witness.\n And she had come after, finding me in this ruin, clinging to something that I could understand. The old iron gate, the rusted bell; the brick pillars swathed in vines; things, fashioned by hands, which had endured. Oh, how she had mocked me.\n The bell that had called the slaves, she said; this was the dwelling place of those who\u0027d drenched this earth in blood; why was I hurt and driven here by the hymns of simple souls who had been exalted? Would that every such house had fallen to ruin. We had fought. Really fought, as lovers fight.\n \"Is that what you want?\" she had said. \"Not ever to taste blood again?\"\n \"I was a simple thing, dangerous yes, but simple. I did what I did to stay alive.\"\n \"Oh, you sadden me. Such lies. Such lies. What must I do to make you see? Are you so blind, so selfish!\"\n I\u0027d glimpsed it again, the pain in her face, the sudden flash of hurt that humanized her utterly. I\u0027d reached out for her.\n And for hours we had been in each other\u0027s arms, or so it seemed.\n And now the peace and the stillness; I walked back from the edge of the cliff, and I held her again. I heard her say as she looked up at the great towering clouds through which the moon poured forth its eerie light: \"This is the Kingdom of Heaven.\"\n It did not matter anymore such simple things as lying down together, or sitting on a stone bench. Standing, my arms wound around her, this was pure happiness. And I\u0027d drunk the nectar again, her nectar, even though I\u0027d been weeping, and thinking ah, well, you are being dissolved as a pearl in wine. You\u0027re gone, you little devil-you\u0027re gone, you know-into her. You stood and watched them die; you stood and watched.\n \"There is no life without death,\" she whispered. \"I am the way now, the way to the only hope of life without strife that there may ever be.\" I felt her lips on my mouth. I wondered, would she ever do what she had done in the shrine? Would we lock together like that, taking the heated blood from each other?\n \"Listen to the singing in the villages, you can hear it.\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"And then listen hard for the sounds of the city far below. Do you know how much death is in that city tonight? How many have been massacred? Do you know how many more will die at the hands of men, if we do not change the destiny of this place? If we do not sweep it up into a new vision? Do you know how long this battle has gone on?\"\n Centuries ago, in my time, this had been the richest colony of the French crown. Rich in tobacco, indigo, coffee. Fortunes had been made here in one season. And now the people picked at the earth; barefoot they walked through the dirt streets of their towns; machine guns barked in the city of Port-au-Prince; the dead in colored cotton shirts lay in heaps on the cobblestones. Children gathered water in cans from the gutters. Slaves had risen; slaves had won; slaves had lost everything.\n But it is their destiny; their world; they who are human.\n She laughed softly. \"And what are we? Are we useless? How do we justify what we are! How do we stand back and watch what we are unwilling to alter?\"\n \"And suppose it is wrong,\" I said, \"and the world is worse for it, and it is all horror finally-unrealizable, unexecutable, what then? And all those men in their graves, the whole earth a graveyard, a funeral pyre. And nothing is better. And it\u0027s wrong, wrong.\"\n \"Who\u0027s to tell you it is wrong?\"\n I didn\u0027t answer.\n \"Marius?\" How scornfully she laughed. \"Don\u0027t you realize there are no fathers now? Angry or no?\"\n \"There are brothers. And there are sisters,\" I said. \"And in each other we find our fathers and mothers, isn\u0027t that so?\"\n Again she laughed, but it was gentle.\n \"Brothers and sisters,\" she said. \"Would you like to see your real brothers and sisters?\"\n I lifted my head from her shoulder. I kissed her cheek. \"Yes. I want to see them.\" My heart was racing again. \"Please,\" I said, even as I kissed her throat, and her cheekbones and her closed eyes. \"Please.\"\n \"Drink again,\" she whispered. I felt her bosom swell against me. I pressed my teeth against her throat and the little miracle happened again, the sudden breaking of the crust, and the nectar poured into my mouth.\n A great hot wave consumed me. No gravity; no specific time or place. Akasha.\n Then I saw the redwood trees; the house with the lights burning in it, and in the high mountaintop room, the table and all of them around it, their faces reflected in the walls of dark glass, and the fire dancing. Marius, Gabrielle, Louis, Armand. They\u0027re together and they\u0027re safe! Am I dreaming this? They\u0027re listening to a red-haired woman. And I know this woman! I\u0027ve seen this woman.\n She was in the dream of the red-haired twins. But I want to see this-these immortals gathered at the table. The young red-haired one, the one at the woman\u0027s side, I\u0027ve seen her too. But she\u0027d been alive then. At the rock concert, in the frenzy, I\u0027d put my arm around her and looked into her crazed eyes. I\u0027d kissed her and said her name; and it was as if a pit had opened under me, and I was falling down into those dreams of the twins that I could never really recall. Painted walls; temples.\n It all faded suddenly. Gabrielle. Mother. Too late. I was reaching out; I was spinning through the darkness.\n You have all of my powers now. You need only time to perfect them. You can bring death, you can move matter, you can make fire. You are ready now to go to them. But we will let them finish their reverie: their stupid schemes and discussion. We will show them a little more of our power; please, Akasha, please, let\u0027s go to them.\n She drew away from me; she struck me.\n I reeled from the shock. Shuddering, cold, I felt the pain spread out through the bones of my face, as if her fingers were still splayed and pressed there. In anger I bit down, letting the pain swell and then recede. In anger I clenched my fists and did nothing.\n She walked across the old flags with crisp steps, her hair swaying as it hung down her back. And then she stopped at the fallen gate, her shoulders rising slightly, her back curved as if she were folding into herself.\n The voices rose; they reached a pitch before I could stop them. And then they lapsed back, like water receding after a great flood.\n I saw the mountains again around me; I saw the ruined house. The pain in my face was gone; but I was shaking.\n She turned and looked at me, tensely, her face sharpened, and her eyes slightly narrowed. \"They mean so much to you, don\u0027t they? What do you think they will do, or say? You think Marius will turn me from my course? I know Marius as you could never know him. I know every pathway of his reason. He is greedy as you are greedy. What do you think I am that I am so easily swayed? I was born a Queen. I have always ruled; even from the shrine I ruled.\" Her eyes were glazed suddenly. I heard the voices, a dull hum rising. \"I ruled if only in legend; if only in the minds of those who came to me and paid me tribute. Princes who played music for me; who brought me offerings and prayers. What do you want of me now? That for you, I renounce my throne, my destiny!\"\n What answer could I make?\n \"You can read my heart,\" I said. \"You know what I want, that you go to them, that you give them a chance to speak on these things as you\u0027ve given me the chance. They have words I don\u0027t have. They know things I don\u0027t know.\"\n \"Oh, but Lestat, I do not love them. I do not love them as I love you. So what does it matter to me what they say? I have no patience for them!\"\n \"But you need them. You said that you did. How can you begin without them? I mean really begin, not with these backward villages, I mean in the cities where the people will fight. Your angels, that\u0027s what you called them.\"\n She shook her head sadly. \"I need no one,\" she said, \"except ... Except...\" She hesitated, and then her face went blank with pure surprise.\n I made some little soft sound before I could stop myself; some little expression of helpless grief. I thought I saw her eyes dim; and it seemed the voices were rising again, not in my ears but in hers; and that she stared at me, but that she didn\u0027t see me.\n \"But I will destroy you all if I have to,\" she said, vaguely, eyes searching for me, but not finding me. \"Believe me when I say it. For this time I will not be vanquished; I will not lapse back. I will see my dreams realized.\"\n I looked away from her, through the ruined gateway, over the broken edge of the cliff, and down over the valley. What would I have given to be released from this nightmare? Would I be willing to die by my own hand? My eyes were filled with tears, looking over the dark fields. It was cowardice to think of it; this was my doing! There was no escape now for me.\n Stark still she stood, listening; and then she blinked slowly; her shoulders moved as if she carried a great weight inside her. \"Why can you not believe in me?\" she said.\n \"Abandon it!\" I answered. \"Turn away from all such visions.\" I went to her and took hold of her arms. Almost groggily she looked up. \"This is a timeless place we stand in-and those poor villages we\u0027ve conquered, they are the same as they\u0027ve been for thousands of years. Let me show you my world, Akasha; let me show you the tiniest part of it! Come with me, like a spy into the cities; not to destroy, but to see!\"\n Her eyes were brightening again; the lassitude was breaking. She embraced me; and suddenly I wanted the blood again. It was all I could think of, even though I was resisting it; even though I was weeping at the pure weakness of my will. I wanted it. I wanted her and I couldn\u0027t fight it; yet my old fantasies came back to me, those long ago visions in which I imagined myself waking her, and taking her with me through the opera houses, and the museums and the symphony halls, through the great capitals and their storehouses of all things beautiful and imperishable that men and women had made over the centuries, artifacts that transcended all evil, all wrongs, all fallibility of the individual soul.\n \"But what have I to do with such paltry things, my love?\" she whispered. \"And you would teach me of your world? Ah, such vanity. I am beyond time as I have always been.\"\n But she was gazing at me now with the most heartbroken expression. Sorrow, that\u0027s what I saw in her.\n \"I need you!\" she whispered. And for the first time her eyes filled with tears.\n 1 couldn\u0027t bear it. I felt the chills rise, as they always do, at moments of surprising pain. But she put her fingers to my lips to silence me.\n \"Very well, my love,\" she said. \"We\u0027ll go to your brothers and sisters, if you wish it. We\u0027ll go to Marius. But first, let me hold you one more time, close to my heart. You see, I cannot be other than what I would be. This is what you waked with your singing; this is what I am!\"\n I wanted to protest, to deny it; I wanted again to begin the argument that would divide us and hurt her. But I couldn\u0027t find the words as I looked into her eyes. And suddenly I realized what had happened.\n I had found the way to stop her; I had found the key; it had been there before me all the time. It was not her love for me; it was her need of me; the need of one ally in all the great realm; one kindred soul made of the same stuff that she was made of. And she had believed she could make me like herself, and now she knew she could not.\n \"Ah, but you are wrong,\" she said, her tears shimmering. \"You are only young and afraid.\" She smiled. \"You belong to me. And if it has to be, my prince, I\u0027ll destroy you.\"\n I didn\u0027t speak. I couldn\u0027t. I knew what I had seen; I knew even as she couldn\u0027t accept it. Not in all the long centuries of stillness had she ever been alone; had she ever suffered the ultimate isolation. Oh, it was not such a simple thing as Enkil by her side, or Marius come to lay before her his offerings; it was something deeper, infinitely more important than that; she had never all alone waged a war of reason with those around her!\n The tears were flowing down her cheeks. Two violent streaks of red. Her mouth was slack; her eyebrows knit in a dark frown, though her face would never be anything but radiant.\n \"No, Lestat,\" she said again. \"You are wrong. But we must see this through now to the finish; if they must die-all of them-so that you cleave to me, so be it.\" She opened her arms.\n I wanted to move away; I wanted to rail against her again, against her threats; but I didn\u0027t move as she came closer.\n Here; the warm Caribbean breeze; her hands moving up my back; her fingers slipping through my hair. The nectar flowing into me again, flooding my heart And her lips on my throat finally the sudden stab of her teeth through my flesh Yes! As it had been in the shrine, so long ago, yes! Her blood and my blood. And the deafening thunder of her heart, yes! And it was ecstasy and yet I couldn\u0027t yield; I couldn\u0027t do it; and she knew it.\n THE STORY OF THE TWINS,\n CONCLUSION\n WE FOUND THE PALACE THE SAME AS WE remembered it, or perhaps a little more lavish, with more booty from conquered lands. More gold drapery, and even more vivid paintings; and twice as many slaves about, as if they were mere ornaments, their lean naked bodies hung with gold and jewels.\n \"To a royal cell we were now committed, with graceful chairs and tables, and a fine carpet, and dishes of meat and fish to eat.\n \"Then at sunset, we heard cheers as the King and the Queen appeared in the palace; all the court went to bow to them, singing anthems to the beauty of their pale skin and their shimmering hair; and to the bodies that had miraculously healed after the assault of the conspirators; all the palace echoed with these hymns of praise.\n \"But when this little spectacle was finished, we were taken into the bedchamber of the royal couple, and for the first time, by the small light of distant lamps, we beheld the transformation with our own eyes.\n \"We saw two pale yet magnificent beings, resembling in all particulars what they had been when they were alive; but there was an eerie luminescence surrounding them; their skin was no longer skin. And their minds were no longer entirely their minds. Yet gorgeous they were. As you can well imagine, all of you. Oh, yes, gorgeous, as though the moon had come down from heaven and fashioned them with its light. Amid their dazzling gold furniture they stood, draped in finery, and staring at us with eyes that gleamed like obsidian. And then, with a wholly different voice, a voice softly shaded by music, it seemed, the King spoke:\n \" \u0027Khayman\u0027s told you what has befallen us,\u0027 he said. \u0027We stand before you the beneficiaries of a great miracle; for we have triumphed over certain death. We are now quite beyond the limitations and needs of human beings; and we see and understand things which were withheld from us before.\u0027\n \"But the Queen\u0027s facade gave way immediately. In a hissing whisper she said, \u0027You must explain this to us! What has your spirit done?\u0027\n \"We were in worse danger than ever from these monsters; and I tried to convey this warning to Mekare, but at once the Queen laughed. \u0027Do you think I don\u0027t know what you are thinking?\u0027 she said.\n \"But the King begged her to be silent. \u0027Let the witches use their powers,1 he said. \u0027You know that we have always revered you.\u0027\n \" \u0027Yes.\u0027 The Queen sneered. \u0027And you sent this curse upon us.\u0027\n \"At once I averred that we had not done it, that we had kept faith when we left the kingdom, that we had gone back to our home. And as Mekare studied the pair of them in silence, I begged them to understand that if the spirit had done this, he had done it of his own whim.\n \" \u0027Whim!\u0027 the Queen said. \u0027What do you mean by such a word as whim? What has happened to us? What are we!\u0027 she asked again. Then she drew back her lips for us to see her teeth. We beheld the fangs in her mouth, tiny, yet sharp as knives. And the King demonstrated to us this change as well.\n \" \u0027The better to draw the blood,\u0027 he whispered. \u0027Do you know what this thirst is to us! We cannot satisfy it! Three, four men a night die to feed us, yet we go to our bed tortured by thirst.\u0027\n \"The Queen tore at her hair as if she would give in to screaming. But the King laid his hand on her arm. \u0027Advise us, Mekare and Maharet,\u0027 he said. \u0027For we would understand this transformation and how it might be used for good.\u0027\n \" \u0027Yes,\u0027 the Queen said, struggling to recover. \"For surely such a thing cannot happen without reason. . . .\u0027 Then losing her conviction, she fell quiet. Indeed it seemed her small pragmatic view of things, ever puny and seeking for justifications, had collapsed utterly, while the King clung to his illusions as men often do, until very late in life.\n \"Now, as they fell silent, Mekare went forward and laid her hands upon the King. She laid her hands upon his shoulders; and closed her eyes. Then she laid her hands upon the Queen in the same manner, though the Queen glared at her with venom in her eyes. \" \u0027Explain to us,\u0027 Mekare said, looking at the Queen, \u0027what happened at the very moment. What do you remember? What did you see?\u0027\n \"The Queen was silent, her face drawn and suspicious. Her beauty had been, in truth, enhanced by this transformation, yet there was something repellent in her, as if she were not the flower now but the replica of the flower made of pure white wax. And as she grew reflective she appeared somber and vicious, and instinctively I drew close to Mekare to protect her from what might take place.\n \"But then the Queen spoke:\n \" \u0027They came to kill us, the traitors! They would blame it on the spirits; that was the plan. And all to eat the flesh again, the flesh of their mothers and fathers, and the flesh for which they loved to hunt. They came into the house and they stabbed me with their daggers, I their sovereign Queen.\u0027 She paused as if seeing these things again before her eyes. \u0027I fell as they slashed at me, as they drove their daggers into my breast. One cannot live with such wounds as I received; and so as I fell to the floor, I knew that I was dead! Do you hear what I am saying? I knew that nothing could save me. My blood was pouring out onto the floor.\n \" \u0027But even as I saw it pooling before me, I realized 1 was not in my wounded body, that I had already left it, that death had taken me and was drawing me upwards sharply as if through a great tunnel to where I would suffer no more!\n \" \u0027I wasn\u0027t frightened; I felt nothing; I looked down and saw myself lying pale and covered with blood in that little house. Yet I did not care. I was free of it. But suddenly something took hold of me, took hold of my invisible being! The tunnel was gone; I was caught in a great mesh like a fisherman\u0027s net. With all my strength I pushed against it, and it gave with my strength but it did not break and it gripped me and held me fast and I could not rise through it.\n \" \u0027When I tried to scream I was in my body again! I felt the agony of my wounds as if the knives were cutting me afresh. But this net, this great net, it still had a hold of me, and instead of being the endless thing it had been before, it was now contracted into a tighter weave like the weave of a great silk veil.\n \" \u0027And all about me this thing-visible yet invisible-whirled as if it were wind, lifting me, casting me down, turning me about. The blood gushed from my wounds. And it ran into the weave of this veil, just as it might into the mesh of any fabric.\n \" \u0027And that which had been transparent was now drenched in blood. And a monstrous thing I saw, shapeless, and enormous, with my blood broadcast throughout it. And yet this thing had another property to it, a center, it seemed, a tiny burning center which was in me, and ran riot in my body like a frightened animal. Through my limbs it ran, thumping and beating. A heart with legs scampering. In my belly it circled as I clawed at myself. I would have cut myself open to get this thing out of me!\n \" \u0027And it seemed the great invisible part of this thing-the blood mist that surrounded me and enveloped me-was controlled by this tiny center, twisting this way and that as it scurried within me, racing into my hands one moment and into my feet the next. Up my spine it ran.\n \" \u0027I would die, surely I would die, I thought. Then came a moment of blindness! Silence. It had killed me, I was certain. I should rise again, should I not? Yet suddenly I opened my eyes; I sat up off the floor as if no attack had befallen me; and I saw so clearly! Khayman, the glaring torch in his hand!-the trees of the garden-why, it was as if I had never truly seen such simple things for what they were! The pain was gone completely, from inside and from my wounds as well. Only the light hurt my eyes; I could not endure its brilliance. Yet I had been saved from death; my body had been glorified and made perfect. Except that-\u0027 And there she stopped.\n \"She stared before her, indifferent for a moment. Then she said, \u0027Khayman has told you all the rest.\u0027 She looked to the King who stood beside her, watching her; trying to fathom the things she said, just as we tried to fathom them.\n \" \u0027Your spirit,\u0027 she said. \u0027It tried to destroy us. But something else had happened; some great power has intervened to triumph over its diabolical evil.\u0027 Then again her conviction deserted her. The lies stopped on her tongue. Her face was suddenly cold with menace. And sweetly she said: \u0027Tell us, witches, wise witches. You who know all the secrets. What is the name for what we are!\u0027 \"Mekare sighed. She looked at me. I knew she didn\u0027t want to speak now on this thing. And the old warning of the spirits came back. The Egyptian King and Queen would ask us questions and they would not like our answers. We would be destroyed. - . -\"Then the Queen turned her back. She sat down and bowed her head. And it was then, and only then, that her true sadness came to the fore. The King smiled at us, wearily. \u0027We are in pain, witches, he said. \u0027We could bear the burden of this transformation if only we understood it better. You, who have communed with all things invisible; tell us what you know of such magic; help us if you will, for you know that we never meant to harm you, only to spread the truth and the law.\u0027\n \"We did not dwell on the stupidity of this statement-the virtue of spreading the truth through wholesale slaughter and so forth and so on. But Mekare demanded that the King now tell what he could recall.\n \"He spoke of things which you-all of you seated here-surely know. Of how he was dying; and how he tasted the blood from his wife which had covered his face; and of how his body quickened, and wanted this blood, and then how he took it from his wife and she gave it; and then he became as she was. But for him there was no mysterious cloud of blood. There was no thing running rampant within him. The thirst, it\u0027s unbearable,\u0027 he said to us. \u0027Unbearable.\u0027 And he too bowed his head.\n \"We stood in silence for a moment looking at each other, Mekare and I, and as always, Mekare spoke first;\n \" \u0027We know no name for what you are,\u0027 she said. \u0027We know no stories of such a thing ever happening in this world before. But it\u0027s plain enough what took place.\u0027 She fixed her eyes upon the Queen. \u0027As you perceived your own death, your soul sought to make its swift escape from suffering as souls so often do. But as it rose, the spirit Amel seized it, this thing being invisible as your soul was invisible; and in the normal course of things you might have easily overcome this earthbound entity and gone on to realms we do not know.\n \" \u0027But this spirit had long before wrought a change within himself; a change that was utterly new. This spirit had tasted the blood of humans whom he had pierced or tormented, as you yourself have seen him do. And your body, lying there, and full of blood despite its many wounds, had life still.\n \" \u0027And so the spirit, thirsting, plunged down into your body, his invisible form still wedded to your soul.\n \" \"Still you might have triumphed, fighting off this evil thing as possessed persons often do. But now the tiny core of this spirit- the thing of matter which is the roaring center of all spirits, from which their endless energy conies-was suddenly filled with blood as never in the past.\n \" \u0027And so the fusion of blood and timeless tissue was a million times magnified and accelerated; and blood flowed through all his body, both material and nonmaterial, and this was the blood cloud that you saw.\n \" \u0027But it is the pain you felt which is most significant, this pain which traveled through your limbs. For surely as inevitable death came to your body, the spirit\u0027s tiny core merged with the flesh of your body as its energy had already merged with your soul. It found some special place or organ in which matter merged with matter as spirit had already merged with spirit; and a new thing was formed.\u0027\n \" \u0027Its heart and my heart,\u0027 the Queen whispered. \u0027They became one.\u0027 And closing her eyes, she lifted her hand and laid it on her breast.\n \"We said nothing, for this seemed a simplification, and we did not believe the heart was the center of intellect or emotion. For us, it had been the brain which controlled these things. And in that moment, both Mekare and I saw a terrible memory-our mother\u0027s heart and brain thrown down and trampled in ashes and dust.\n \"But we fought this memory. It was abhorrent that this pain should be glimpsed by those who had been its cause.\n \"The King pressed us with a question. \u0027Very well,\u0027 he said, \u0027you\u0027ve explained what has happened to Akasha. This spirit is in her, core wedded perhaps to core. But what is in me? I felt no such pain, no such scurrying demon. I felt... I felt only the thirst when her bloodied hands touched my lips.\u0027 He looked to his wife.\n \"The shame, the horror, they felt over the thirst was clear.\n \" \u0027But the same spirit is in you, too,\u0027 Mekare answered. There is but one Amel.
