{"id":102400,"no":41,"title":"Page 41","content":"\"Yes, for that\u0027s the essence of it,\" Marius said, his tone careful again, fearful, and almost pleading. \"It\u0027s a lie, Akasha; it\u0027s another superstitious lie! Have we not had enough of them? And now, of all times, when the world\u0027s waking from its old delusions. When it has thrown off the old gods.\"\\n\\n \"A lie?\" she asked. She drew back, as if he\u0027d hurt her. \"What is the lie? Did I lie when I told them I would bring a reign of peace on earth? Did I lie when I told them I was the one they had been waiting for? No, I didn\u0027t lie. What I can do is give them the first bit of truth they\u0027ve ever had! I am what they think I am. I am eternal, and all powerful, and shall protect them-\"\\n\\n \"Protect them?\" Marius asked. \"How can you protect them from their most deadly foes?\"\\n\\n \"What foes?\"\\n\\n \"Disease, my Queen. Death. You are no healer. You cannot give life or save it. And they will expect such miracles. All you can do is kill. \"\\n\\n Silence. Stillness. Her face suddenly as lifeless as it had been in the shrine; eyes staring forward; emptiness or deep thought, impossible to distinguish.\\n\\n No sound but the wood shifting and falling into the fire.\\n\\n \"Akasha,\" I whispered. \"Time, the thing that Maharet asked for. A century. So little to give.\"\\n\\n Dazed, she looked at me. I could feel death breathing on my face, death close as it had been years and years ago when the wolves tracked me into the frozen forest, and I couldn\u0027t reach up high enough for the limbs of the barren trees.\\n\\n \"You are all my enemies, aren\u0027t you?\" she whispered. \"Even you, my prince. You are my enemy. My lover and my enemy at the same time.\"\\n\\n \"I love you!\" I said. \"But I can\u0027t lie to you. I cannot believe in it! It is wrong! It is the very simplicity and the elegance which make it so wrong!\"\\n\\n Her eyes moved rapidly over their faces. Eric was on the verge of panic again. And I could feel the anger cresting in Mael.\\n\\n \"Is there not one of you who would stand with me?\" she whispered. \"Not one who would reach for that dazzling dream? Not even one who is ready to forsake his or her small and selfish world?\" Her eyes fixed on Pandora. \"Ah, you, poor dreamer, grieving for your lost humanity; would you not be redeemed?\"\\n\\n Pandora stared as if through a dim glass. \"I have no taste for bringing death,\" she answered in an even softer whisper. \"It is enough for me to see it in the falling leaves. I cannot believe good things can come from bloodshed. For that\u0027s the crux, my Queen. Those horrors happen still, but good men and women everywhere deplore them; you would reclaim such methods; you would exonerate them and bring the dialogue to an end.\" She smiled sadly. \"I am a useless thing to you. I have nothing to give.\"\\n\\n Akasha didn\u0027t respond. Then her eyes moved over the others again; she took the measure of Mael, of Eric. Of Jesse.\\n\\n \"Akasha,\" I said. \"History is a litany of injustice, no one denies it. But when has a simple solution ever been anything but evil? Only in complexity do we find answers. Through complexity men struggle towards fairness; it is slow and clumsy, but it\u0027s the only way. Simplicity demands too great a sacrifice. It always has.\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Marius said. \"Exactly. Simplicity and brutality are synonymous in philosophy and in actions. It is brutal what you propose!\"\\n\\n \"Is there no humility in you?\" she asked suddenly. She turned from me to him. \"Is there no willingness to understand? You are so proud, all of you, so arrogant. You want your world to remain the same on account of your greed!\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Marius said.\\n\\n \"What have I done that you should set yourselves so against me?\" she demanded. She looked at me, then at Marius, and finally to Maharet. \"From Lestat I expected arrogance,\" she said. \"I expected platitudes and rhetoric, and untested ideas. But from many of you I expected more. Oh, how you disappoint me. How can you turn away from the destiny that awaits you? You who could be saviors! How can you deny what you have seen?\"\\n\\n \"But they\u0027d want to know what we really are,\" Santino said. \"And once they did know, they\u0027d rise against us. They\u0027d want the immortal blood as they always do.\"\\n\\n \"Even women want to live forever,\" Maharet \u0027said coldly. \"Even women would kill for that.\"\\n\\n \"Akasha, it\u0027s folly,\" said Marius. \"It cannot be accomplished. For the Western world, not to resist would be unthinkable.\"\\n\\n \"It is a savage and primitive vision,\" Maharet said with cold scorn.\\n\\n Akasha\u0027s face darkened again with anger. Yet even in rage, the prettiness of her expression remained. \"You have always opposed me!\" she said to Maharet. \"I would destroy you if I could. I would hurt those you love.\"\\n\\n There was a stunned silence. I could smell the fear of the others, though no one dared to move or speak.\\n\\n Maharet nodded. She smiled knowingly.\\n\\n \"It is you who are arrogant,\" she answered. \"It is you who have learned nothing. It is you who have not changed in six thousand years. It is your soul which remains unperfected, while mortals move to realms you will never grasp. In your isolation you dreamed dreams as thousands of mortals have done, protected from all scrutiny or challenge; and you emerge from your silence, ready to make these dreams real for the world? You bring them here to this table, among a handful of your fellow creatures, and they crumble. You cannot defend them. How could anyone defend them? And you tell us we deny what we see!\"\\n\\n Slowly Maharet rose from the chair. She leant forward slightly, her weight resting on her fingers as they touched the wood.\\n\\n \"Well, I\u0027ll tell you what I see,\" she went on. \"Six thousand years ago, when men believed in spirits, an ugly and irreversible accident occurred; it was as awful in its own way as the monsters born now and then to mortals which nature does not suffer to live. But you, clinging to life, and clinging to your will, and clinging to your royal prerogative, refused to take that awful mistake with you to an early grave. To sanctify it, that was your purpose. To spin a great and glorious religion; and that is still your purpose now. But it was an accident finally, a distortion, and nothing more.\\n\\n \"And look now at the ages since that dark and evil moment\u0027 look at the other religions founded upon magic; founded upon some apparition or voice from the clouds! Founded upon the intervention of the supernatural in one guise or another-miracles, revelations, a mortal man rising from the dead!\\n\\n \"Look on the effect of your religions, those movements that have swept up millions with their fantastical claims. Look at what they have done to human history. Look at the wars fought on account of them; look at the persecutions, the massacres. Look at the pure enslavement of reason; look at the price of faith and zeal.\\n\\n \"And you tell us of children dying in the Eastern countries, in the name of Allah as the guns crackle and the bombs fall!\\n\\n \"And the war of which you speak in which one tiny European nation sought to exterminate a people. ... In the name of what grand spiritual design for a new world was that done? And what does the world remember of it? The death camps, the ovens in which bodies were burnt by the thousands. The ideas are gone!\\n\\n \"I tell you, we would be hard put to determine what is more evil-religion or the pure idea. The intervention of the supernatural or the elegant simple abstract solution! Both have bathed this earth in suffering; both have brought the human race literally and figuratively to its knees.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you see? It is not man who is the enemy of the human species. It is the irrational; it is the spiritual when it is divorced from the material; from the lesson in one beating heart or one bleeding vein.\\n\\n \"You accuse us of greed. Ah, but our greed is our salvation. Because we know what we are; we know our limits and we know our sins; you have never known yours.\\n\\n \"You would begin it all again, wouldn\u0027t you? You would bring a new religion, a new revelation, a new wave of superstition and sacrifice and death.\"\\n\\n \"You lie,\" Akasha answered, her voice barely able to contain her fury. \"You betray the very beauty I dream of; you betray it because you have no vision, you have no dreams.\"\\n\\n \"The beauty is out there!\" Maharet said. \"It does not deserve your violence! Are you so merciless that the lives you would destroy mean nothing! Ah, it was always so!\"\\n\\n The tension was unbearable. The blood sweat was breaking out on my body. I could see the panic all around. Louis had bowed his head and covered his face with his hands. Only the young Daniel seemed hopelessly enraptured. And Armand merely gazed at Akasha as if it were all out of his hands.\\n\\n Akasha was silently struggling. But then she appeared to regain her conviction.\\n\\n \"You lie as you have always done,\" she said desperately. \"But it does not matter whether you fight on my side. I will do what I mean to do; I will reach back over the millennia and I will redeem that long ago moment, that long ago evil which you and your sister brought into our land; I will reach back and raise it up in the eyes of the world until it becomes the Bethlehem of the new era; and peace on earth will exist at last. There is no great good that was ever done without sacrifice and courage. And if you all turn against me, if you all resist me, then I shall make of better mettle the angels I require.\"\\n\\n \"No, you will not do it,\" Maharet said.\\n\\n \"Akasha, please,\" Marius said. \"Grant us time. Agree only to wait, to consider. Agree that nothing must come from this moment.\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" I said. \"Give us time. Come with me. Let us go together out there-you and I and Marius-out of dreams and visions and into the world itself.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, how you insult me and belittle me,\" she whispered. Her anger was turned on Marius but it was about to turn on me.\\n\\n \"There are so many things, so many places,\" he said, \"that I want to show you! Only give me a chance. Akasha, for two thousand years I cared for you, I protected you ...\"\\n\\n \"You protected yourself! You protected the source of your power, the source of your evil!\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m imploring you,\" Marius said. \"I will get on my knees to you. A month only, to come with me, to let us talk together, to let us examine all the evidence . . .\"\\n\\n \"So small, so selfish,\" Akasha whispered. \"And you feel no debt to the world that made you what you are, no debt to give it now the benefit of your power, to alchemize yourselves from devils into gods!\"\\n\\n She turned to me suddenly, the shock spreading over her face.\\n\\n \"And you, my prince, who came into my chamber as if I were the Sleeping Beauty, who brought me to life again with your passionate kiss. Will you not reconsider? For my love!\" The tears again were standing in her eyes. \"Must you join with them now against me, too?\" She reached up and placed her two hands on the sides of my face. \"How can you betray me?\" she said. \"How can you betray such a dream? They are slothful beings; deceitful; full of malice. But your heart was pure. You had a courage that transcended pragmatism. You had your dreams too!\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t have to answer. She knew. She could see it better perhaps than I could see it. And all I saw was the suffering in her black eyes. The pain, the incomprehension; and the grief she was already experiencing for me.\\n\\n It seemed she couldn\u0027t move or speak suddenly. And there was nothing I could do now; nothing to save them; or me. I loved her! But I couldn\u0027t stand with her! Silently, I begged her to understand and forgive.\\n\\n Her face was frozen, almost as if the voices had reclaimed her, it was as if I were standing before her throne in the path of her changeless gaze.\\n\\n \"I will kill you first, my prince,\" she said, her fingers caressing me all the more gently. \"I want you gone from me. I will not look into your face and see this betrayal again.\"\\n\\n \"Harm him and that shall be our signal,\" Maharet whispered. \"We shall move against you as one.\"\\n\\n \"And you move against yourselves!\" she answered, glancing at Maharet. \"When I finish with this one I love, I shall kill those you love; those who should have been dead already; I shall destroy all those whom I can destroy; but who shall destroy me?\"\\n\\n \"Akasha,\" Marius whispered. He rose and came towards her; but she moved in the blink of an eye and knocked him to the floor. I heard him cry out as he fell. Santino went to his aid.\\n\\n Again, she looked at me; and her hands closed on my shoulders, gentle and loving as before. And through the veil of my tears, I saw her smile sadly. \"My prince, my beautiful prince,\" she said.\\n\\n Khayman rose from the table. Eric rose. And Mae!. And then the young ones rose, and lastly Pandora, who moved to Marius\u0027s side.\\n\\n She released me. And she too rose to her feet. The night was so quiet suddenly that the forest seemed to sigh against the glass.\\n\\n And this is what I\u0027ve wrought, I who alone remained seated, looking not at any of them, but at nothing. At the small glittering sweep of my life, my little triumphs, my little tragedies, my dreams of waking the goddess, my dreams of goodness, and of fame.\\n\\n What was she doing? Assessing their power? Looking from one to the other, and then back to me. A stranger looking down from some lofty height. And so now the fire comes, Lestat. Don\u0027t dare to look at Gabrielle or Louis, lest she turn it that way. Die first, like a coward, and then you don\u0027t have to see them die.\\n\\n And the awful part is, you won\u0027t know who wins finally- whether or not she triumphs, or we all go down together. Just like not knowing what it was all about, or why, or what the hell the dream of the twins meant, or how this whole world came into being. You just won\u0027t ever know.\\n\\n I was weeping now and she was weeping and she was that tender fragile being again, the being I had held on Saint-Domingue, the one who needed me, but that weakness wasn\u0027t destroying her after all, though it would certainly destroy me.\\n\\n \"Lestat,\" she whispered as if in disbelief.\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t follow you,\" I said, my voice breaking. Slowly I rose to my feet. \"We\u0027re not angels, Akasha; we are not gods. To be human, that\u0027s what most of us long for. It is the human which has become myth to us.\"\\n\\n It was killing me to look at her. I thought of her blood flowing \" into me; of the powers she\u0027d given me. Of what it had been like to travel with her through the clouds. I thought of the euphoria in the Haitian village when the women had come with their candles, singing their hymns.\\n\\n \"But that is what it will be, my beloved,\" she whispered. \"Find your courage! It\u0027s there.\" The blood tears were coursing down her face. Her lip trembled and the smooth flesh of her forehead was creased with those perfectly straight lines of utter distress.\\n\\n Then she straightened. She looked away from me: and her face went blank and beautifully smooth again. She looked past us, and I felt she was reaching for the strength to do it, and the others had better act fast. I wished for that-like sticking a dagger into her; they had better bring her down now, and I could feel the tears sliding down my face.\\n\\n But something else was happening. There was a great soft musical sound from somewhere. Glass shattering, a great deal of glass. There was a sudden obvious excitement in Daniel. In Jesse, But the old ones stood frozen, listening. Again, glass breaking; someone entering by one of the many portals of this rambling house.\\n\\n She took a step back. She quickened as if seeing a vision; and a loud hollow sound filled the stairwell beyond the open door. Someone down below in the passage.\\n\\n She moved away from the table, towards the fireplace. She seemed for all the world afraid.\\n\\n Was that possible? Did she know who was coming, and was it another old one? And was that what she feared-that more could accomplish what these few could not?\\n\\n It was nothing so calculated finally; I knew it; she was being defeated inside. All courage was leaving her. It was the need, the loneliness, after all! It had begun with my resistance, and they had deepened it, and then I had dealt her yet another blow. And now she was transfixed by this loud, echoing, and impersonal noise. Yet she did know who this person was, I could sense it. And the others knew too.\\n\\n The noise was growing louder. The visitor was coming up the stairs. The skylight and the old iron pylons reverberated with the shock of each heavy step.\\n\\n \"But who is it!\" I said suddenly. I could stand it no longer. There was that image again, that image of the mother\u0027s body and the twins.\\n\\n \"Akasha!\" Marius said. \"Give us the time we ask for. Forswear the moment. That is enough!\"\\n\\n \"Enough for what!\" she cried sharply, almost savagely.\\n\\n \"For our lives, Akasha,\" he said. \"For all our lives!\"\\n\\n I heard Khayman laugh softly, the one who hadn\u0027t spoken even once.\\n\\n The steps had reached the landing.\\n\\n Maharet stood at the edge of the open doorway, and Mael was beside her. I hadn\u0027t even seen them move.\\n\\n Then I saw who and what it was. The woman I\u0027d glimpsed moving through the jungles, clawing her way out of the earth, walking the long miles on the barren plain. The other twin of the dreams I\u0027d never understood! And now she stood framed in the dim light from the stairwell, staring straight at the distant figure of Akasha, who stood some thirty feet away with her back to the glass wall and the blazing fire.\\n\\n Oh, but the sight of this one. Gasps came from the others, even from the old ones, from Marius himself.\\n\\n A thin layer of soil encased her all over, even the rippling shape of her long hair. Broken, peeling, stained by the rain even, the mud still clung to her, clung to her naked arms and bare feet as if she were made of it, made of earth itself. It made a mask of her face. And her eyes peered out of the mask, naked, rimmed in red.\\n\\n A rag covered her, a blanket filthy and torn, and tied with a hemp rope around her waist.\\n\\n What impulse could make such a being cover herself, what tender human modesty had caused this living corpse to stop and make this simple garment, what suffering remnant of the human heart?\\n\\n Beside her, staring at her, Maharet appeared to weaken suddenly all over as if her slender body were going to drop.\\n\\n \"Mekare!\" she whispered.\\n\\n But the woman didn\u0027t see her or hear her; the woman stared at Akasha, the eyes gleaming with fearless animal cunning as Akasha moved back towards the table, putting the table between herself and this creature, Akasha\u0027s face hardening, her eyes full of undisguised hate.\\n\\n \"Mekare!\" Maharet cried. She threw out her hands and tried to catch the woman by the shoulders and turn her around.\\n\\n The woman\u0027s right hand went out, shoving Maharet backwards so that she was thrown yards across the room until she tumbled against the wall.\\n\\n The great sheet of plate glass vibrated, but did not shatter. Gingerly Maharet touched it with her fingers; then with the fluid grace of a cat, she sprang up and into the arms of Eric, who was rushing to her aid.\\n\\n Instantly he pulled her back towards the door. For the woman now struck the enormous table and sent it sliding northward, and then over on its side.\\n\\n Gabrielle and Louis moved swiftly into the northwest corner, Santino and Armand the other way, towards Mael and Eric and Maharet.\\n\\n Those of us on the other side merely backed away, except for Jesse, who had moved towards the door.\\n\\n She stood beside Khayman and as I looked at him now I saw with amazement that he wore a thin, bitter smile.\\n\\n \"The curse, my Queen,\" he said, his voice rising sharply to fill the room.\\n\\n The woman froze as she heard him behind her. But she did not turn around.\\n\\n And Akasha, her face shimmering in the firelight, quavered visibly, and the tears flowed again.\\n\\n \"All against me, all of you!\" she said. \"Not a one who would come to my side!\" She stared at me, even as the woman moved towards her.\\n\\n The woman\u0027s muddy feet scraped the carpet, her mouth gaping and her hands only slightly poised, her arms still down at her sides. Yet it was the perfect attitude of menace as she took one slow step after another.\\n\\n But again Khayman spoke, bringing her suddenly to a halt. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-queen-of-the-damned-the-vampire-chronicles-3/page-41.html","bookId":2211,"book":{"id":2211,"title":"The Queen Of The Damned (The Vampire Chronicles #3)","description":"Storyline: The Queen of the Damned (The Vampire Chronicles #3) \\n The Queen of the Damned is the third novel of Anne Rice\u0027s The Vampire Chronicles series.
