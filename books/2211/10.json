{"id":102370,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"Often Daniel watched Armand go out alone to hunt the warm southern waters, a youth in soft black silk shirt and black pants, manning a sleek unlighted speedboat, the wind whipping his uncut long hair. Such a deadly foe. Somewhere far out there, beyond sight of land, he finds his smugglers and he strikes-the lone pirate, death. Are the victims dropped into the deep, hair billowing perhaps for one moment while the moon can still illuminate them as they look up for a last glimpse at what has been their ruin? This boy! They thought they were the evil ones. . . . \"Would you let me go with you? Would you let me see it when you do it?\" \"No.\" Finally enough capital had been amassed; Armand was ready for real action. He ordered Daniel to make purchases without counsel or hesitation: a fleet of cruise ships, a chain of restaurants and hotels. Four private planes were now at their disposal. Armand had eight phones. And then came the final dream: the Night Island, Armand\u0027s own personal creation with its five dazzling glass stories of theaters, restaurants, and shops. He drew the pictures for the architects he\u0027d chosen. He gave them endless lists of the materials he wanted, the fabrics, the sculptures for the fountains, even the flowers, the potted trees. Behold, the Night Island. From sunset till dawn, the tourists mobbed it, as boat after boat brought them out from the Miami docks. The music played eternally in the lounges, on the dance floors. The glass elevators never stopped their climb to heaven; ponds, streams, waterfalls glittered amid banks of moist, fragile blooms. You could buy anything on the Night Island-diamonds, a Coca-Cola, books, pianos, parrots, designer fashions, porcelain dolls. All the fine cuisines of the world awaited you. Five films played nightly in the cinemas. Here was English tweed and Spanish leather, Indian silk, Chinese carpets, sterling silver, ice-cream cones or cotton candy, bone china, and Italian shoes. Or you could live adjacent to it, in secret luxury, slipping in and out of the whirl at will. \"All this is yours, Daniel,\" Armand said, moving slowly through the spacious airy rooms of their very own Villa of the Mysteries, which covered three stories-and cellars, to Daniel-windows open to the distant burning nightscape of Miami, to the dim high clouds rolling above. Gorgeous the skilled mixture of old and new. Elevator doors rolling back on broad rectangular rooms full of medieval tapestries and antique chandeliers; giant television sets in every room. Renaissance paintings filled Daniel\u0027s suite, where Persian rugs covered the parquet. The finest of the Venetian school surrounded Armand in his white carpeted study full of shining computers, intercoms, and monitors. The books, magazines, newspapers came from all over the world. \"This is your home, Daniel.\" And so it had been and Daniel had loved it, he had to admit that, and what he had loved even more was the freedom, the power, and the luxury that attended him everywhere that he went. He and Armand had gone into the depths of the Central American jungles by night to see the Mayan ruins; they had gone up the flank of Annapurna to glimpse the distant summit under the light of the moon. Through the crowded streets of Tokyo they had wandered together, through Bangkok and Cairo and Damascus, through Lima and Rio and Kathmandu. By day Daniel wallowed in comfort at the best of the local hostelries; by night he wandered fearless with Armand at his side. Now and then, however, the illusion of civilized life would break down. Sometimes in some far-flung place, Armand sensed the presence of other immortals. He explained that he had thrown his shield around Daniel, yet it worried him. Daniel must stay at his side. \"Make me what you are and worry no more.\" \"You don\u0027t know what you\u0027re saying,\" Armand had answered. \"Now you\u0027re one of a billion faceless humans. If you were one of us, you\u0027d be a candle burning in the dark.\" Daniel wouldn\u0027t accept it. \"They would spot you without fail,\" Armand continued. He had become angry, though not at Daniel. The fact was he disliked any talk at all of the undead. \"Don\u0027t you know the old ones destroy the young ones out of hand?\" he\u0027d asked. \"Didn\u0027t your beloved Louis explain that to you? It\u0027s what I do everywhere that we settle-I clean them out, the young ones, the vermin. But I am not invincible.\" He\u0027d paused as though debating whether or not he should continue. Then: \"I\u0027m like any beast on the prowl. I have enemies who are older and stronger who would try to destroy me if it interested them to do so, I am sure.\" \"Older than you are? But I thought you were the oldest,\" Daniel had said. It had been years since they\u0027d spoken of Interview with the Vampire. They had, in fact, never discussed its contents in detail. \"No, of course I\u0027m not the oldest,\" Armand had answered. He seemed slightly uneasy. \"Merely the oldest your friend Louis was ever to find. There are others. I don\u0027t know their names, I\u0027ve seldom seen their faces. But at times, I feel them. You might say that we feel each other. We send our silent yet powerful signals. \u0027Keep away from me.\u0027 \" The following night, he\u0027d given Daniel the locket, the amulet as he called it, to wear. He\u0027d kissed it first and rubbed it in his hands as if to warm it. Strange to witness this ritual. Stranger still to see the thing itself with the letter A carved on it, and inside the tiny vial of Armand\u0027s blood. \"Here, snap the clasp if they come near you. Break the vial instantly. And they will feel the power that protects you. They will not dare-\" \"Ah, you\u0027ll let them kill me. You know you will,\" Daniel had said coldly. Shut out. \"Give me the power to fight for myself.\" But he had worn the locket ever since. Under the lamp, he\u0027d examined the A and the intricate carvings all over the thing to find they were tiny twisted human figures, some mutilated, others writhing as if in agony, some dead. Horrid thing actually. He had dropped the chain down into his shirt, and it was cold against his naked chest, but out of sight. Yet Daniel was never to see or sense the presence of another supernatural being. He remembered Louis as if he\u0027d been a hallucination, something known in a fever. Armand was Daniel\u0027s single oracle, his merciless and all-loving demonic god. More and more his bitterness increased. Life with Armand inflamed him, maddened him. It had been years since Daniel had even thought of his family, of the friends he used to know. Checks went out to kin, of that he\u0027d made certain, but they were just names now on a list. \"You\u0027ll never die, and yet you look at me and you watch me die, night after night, you watch it.\" Ugly fights, terrible fights, finally, Armand broken down, glassy-eyed with silent rage, then crying softly but uncontrollably as if some lost emotion had been rediscovered which threatened to tear him apart. \"I will not do it, I cannot do it. Ask me to kill you, it would be easier than that. You don\u0027t know what you ask for, don\u0027t you see? It is always a damnable error! Don\u0027t you realize that any one of us would give it up for one human lifetime?\" \"Give up immortality, just to live one life? I don\u0027t believe you. This is the first time you have told me an out-and-out lie.\" \"How dare you!\" \"Don\u0027t hit me. You might kill me. You\u0027re very strong.\" \"I\u0027d give it up. If I weren\u0027t a coward when it gets right down to it, if I weren\u0027t after five hundred greedy years in this whirlwind still terrified to the marrow of my bones of death.\" \"No, you wouldn\u0027t. Fear has nothing to do with it. Imagine one lifetime back then when you were born. And all this lost? The future in which you know power and luxury of which Genghis Khan never dreamed? But forget the technical miracles. Would you settle for ignorance of the world\u0027s destiny? Ah, don\u0027t tell me you would.\" No resolution in words was ever reached. It would end with the embrace, the kiss, the blood stinging him, the shroud of dreams closing over him like a great net, hunger! I love you! Give me more! Yes, more. But never enough. It was useless. What had these transfusions done to his body and soul? Made him see the descent of the falling leaf in greater detail? Armand was not going to give it to him! Armand would see Daniel leave time and again, and drift off into the terrors of the everyday world, risk that, rather than do it. There was nothing Daniel could do, nothing he could give. And the wandering started, the escaping, and Armand did not follow him. Armand would wait each time until Daniel begged to come back. Or until Daniel was beyond calling, until Daniel was on the verge of death itself. And then and only then, Armand would bring him back. The rain hit the wide pavements of Michigan Avenue. The bookstore was empty, the lights had gone out. Somewhere a clock had struck the hour of nine. He stood against the glass watching the traffic stream past in front of him. Nowhere to go. Drink the tiny drop of blood inside the locket. Why not? And Lestat in California, on the prowl already, perhaps stalking a victim even now. And they were preparing the hall for the concert, weren\u0027t they? Mortal men rigging up lights, microphones, concession stands, oblivious to the secret codes being given, the sinister audience that would conceal itself in the great indifferent and inevitably hysterical human throng. Ah, maybe Daniel had made a horrible miscalculation. Maybe Armand was there! At first it seemed an impossibility, then a certainty. Why hadn\u0027t Daniel realized this before? Surely Armand had gone! If there was any truth at all in what Lestat had written, Armand would go for a reckoning, to witness, to search perhaps for those he\u0027d lost over the centuries now drawn to Lestat by the same call. And what would a mortal lover matter then, a human who\u0027d been no more than a toy for a decade? No. Armand had gone on without him. And this time there would be no rescue. He felt cold, small, as he stood there. He felt miserably alone. It didn\u0027t matter, his premonitions, how the dream of the twins descended upon him and then left him with foreboding. These were things that were passing him by like great black wings. You could feel the indifferent wind as they swept over. Armand had proceeded without him towards a destiny that Daniel would never fully understand. It filled him with horror, with sadness. Gates locked. The anxiety aroused by the dream mingled with a dull sickening fear. He had come to the end of the line. What would he do? Wearily, he envisioned the Night Island locked against him. He saw the villa behind its white walls, high above the beach, impossible to reach. He imagined his past gone, along with his future. Death was the understanding of the immediate present: that there is finally nothing else. He walked on a few steps; his hands were numb. The rain had drenched his sweatshirt. He wanted to lie down on the very pavement and let the twins come again. And Lestat\u0027s phrases ran through his head. The Dark Trick he called the moment of rebirth. The Savage Garden he called the world that could embrace such exquisite monsters, ah, yes. But let me be a lover in the Savage Garden with you, and the light that went out of life would come back in a great burst of glory. Out of mortal flesh I would pass into eternity. I would be one of you. Dizzy. Did he almost fall? Someone talking to him, someone asking if he was all right. No, of course not. Why should I be? But there was a hand on his shoulder. Daniel. He looked up. Armand stood at the curb. At first he could not believe it, he wanted it so badly, but there was no denying what he saw. Armand stood there. He was peering silently from the unearthly stillness he seemed to carry with him, his face flushed beneath the faintest touch of unnatural pallor. How normal he looked, if beauty is ever normal. And yet how strangely set apart from the material things touching him, the rumpled white coat and pants he wore. Behind him the big gray hulk of a Rolls waited, like an ancillary vision, droplets teeming on its silver roof. Come on, Daniel. You made it hard for me this time, didn\u0027t you, so hard. Why the urgency of the command when the hand that pulled him forward was so strong? Such a rare thing to see Armand truly angry. Ah, how Daniel loved this anger! His knees went out from under him. He felt himself lifted. And then the soft velvet of the back seat of the car spread out under him. He fell over on his hands. He closed his eyes. But Armand gently pulled him upright, held him. The car rocked gently, deliciously as it moved forward. So nice to sleep at last in Armand\u0027s arms. But there was so much he must tell Armand, so much about the dream, the book. \"Don\u0027t you think I know?\" Armand whispered. A strange light in the eye, what was it? Something raw and tender in the way Armand looked, all the composure stripped away. He lifted a tumbler half full of brandy and put it in Daniel\u0027s hand. \"And you running from me,\" he said, \"from Stockholm and Edinburgh and Paris. What do you think I am that I can follow you at such speed down so many pathways? And such danger-\" Lips against Daniel\u0027s face, suddenly, ah, that\u0027s better, I like kissing. And snuggling with dead things, yes, hold me. He buried his face in Armand\u0027s neck. Your blood. \"Not yet, my beloved.\" Armand pushed him forward, pressing his fingers to Daniel\u0027s lips. Such uncommon feeling in the low, controlled voice. \"Listen to what I\u0027m saying to you. All over the world, our kind are being destroyed.\" Destroyed. It sent a current of panic through him, so that his body tensed in spite of his exhaustion. He tried to focus on Armand, but he saw the red-haired twins again, the soldiers, the blackened body of the mother being overturned in the ashes. But the meaning, the continuity . . . Why? \"I cannot tell you,\" Armand said. And he meant the dream when he spoke, because he\u0027d had the dream too. He lifted the brandy to Daniel\u0027s lips. Oh, so warm, yes. He would slip into unconsciousness if he didn\u0027t hold tight. They were racing silently along the freeway now, out of Chicago, the rain flooding the windows, locked together in this warm, velvet-lined little place. Ah, such lovely silver rain. And Armand had turned away, distracted, as if listening to some faraway music, his lips parted, frozen on the verge of speech. I\u0027m with you, safe with you. \"No, Daniel, not safe,\" he answered. \"Maybe not even for a night or so much as an hour.\" Daniel tried to think, to form a question, but he was too weak, too drowsy. The car was so comfortable, the motion of it so soothing. And the twins. The beautiful red-haired twins wanted in now! His eyes closed for a split second and he sank against Armand\u0027s shoulder, feeling Armand\u0027s hand on his back. Far away he heard Armand\u0027s voice: \"What do I do with you, my beloved? Especially now, when I myself am so afraid.\" Darkness again. He held fast to the taste of the brandy in his mouth, to the touch of Armand\u0027s hand, but he was already dreaming. The twins were walking in the desert; the sun was high above. It burned their white arms, their faces. Their lips were swollen and cracked from thirst. Their dresses were stained with blood. \"Make the rain fall,\" Daniel whispered aloud, \"you can do it, make the rain fall.\" One of the twins fell down on her knees, and her sister knelt and put her arms around her. Red hair and red hair. Somewhere far off he heard Armand\u0027s voice again. Armand said that they were too deep in the desert. Not even their spirits could make rain in such a place. But why? Couldn\u0027t spirits do anything? \" He felt Armand kiss him gently again. The twins have now entered a low mountain pass. But there is no shade because the sun is directly above them, and the rocky slopes are too treacherous for them to climb. On they walk. Can\u0027t someone help them? They stumble and fall every few steps now. The rocks look too hot to touch. Finally one of them falls face down in the sand, and the other lies over her, sheltering her with her hair. Oh, if only evening would come, with its cold winds. Suddenly the twin who is protecting her sister looks up. Movement on the cliffs. Then stillness again. A rock falls, echoes with a soft clear shuffling sound. And then Daniel sees the men moving over the precipices, desert people as they have looked for thousands of years with their dark skin and heavy white robes. The twins rise on their knees together as these men approach. The men offer them water. They pour the cool water over the twins. Suddenly the twins are laughing and talking hysterically, so great is their relief, but the men don\u0027t understand. Then it is gestures, so purely eloquent, as one twin points to the belly of her sister, and then folding her arms makes the universal sign for rocking a child. Ah, yes. The men lift the pregnant woman. And all move together towards the oasis, round which their tents stand. At last by the light of a fire outside the tent, the twins sleep, safe, among the desert people, the Bedouins. Could it be that the Bedouins are so very ancient, that their history goes back thousands and thousands of years? At dawn, one of the twins rises, the one who does not carry a child. As her sister watches, she walks out towards the olive trees of the oasis. She lifts her arms, and at first it seems she is only welcoming the sun. Others have awakened; they gather to see. Then a wind rises, gently, moving the branches of the olive trees. And the rain, the light sweet rain begins to fall. He opened his eyes. He was on the plane. He recognized the small bedroom immediately by the white plastic walls and the soothing quality of the dim yellow light. Everything synthetic, hard and gleaming like the great rib bones of prehistoric creatures. Have things come full circle? Technology has recreated Jonah\u0027s chamber deep within the belly of the whale. He was lying on the bed that had no head or foot or legs or frame to it. Someone had washed his hands and his face. He was clean-shaven. Ah, that felt so good. And the roar of the engines was a huge silence, the whale breathing, slicing through the sea. That made it possible for him to see things around him very distinctly. A decanter. Bourbon. He wanted it. But he was too exhausted to move. And something not right, something. ... He reached up, felt his neck. The amulet was gone! But it didn\u0027t matter. He was with Armand. Armand sat at the little table near the whale\u0027s eye window, the white plastic lid pulled all the way down. He had cut his hair. And he wore black wool now, neat and fine, like the corpse again dressed for the funeral even to the shining black shoes. Grim all this. Someone will now read the Twenty-third Psalm. Bring back the white clothes. \"You\u0027re dying,\" Armand said softly. \" \u0027And though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,\u0027 et cetera,\" Daniel whispered. His throat was so dry. And his head ached. Didn\u0027t matter saying what was really on his mind. AH been said long ago. Armand spoke again silently, a laser beam touching Daniel\u0027s brain: Shall we bother with the particulars? You weigh no more than a hundred and thirty pounds now. And the alcohol is eating at your insides. You are half mad. There is almost nothing left in the world that you enjoy. \"Except talking to you now and then. It\u0027s so easy to hear everything you say.\" If you were never to see me again, that would only make things worse. If you go on as you are, you won\u0027t live another five days. Unbearable thought, actually. But if that\u0027s so, then why have I been running away? No response. How clear everything seemed. It wasn\u0027t only the roar of the engines, it was the curious movement of the plane, that never-ending irregular undulation as if it rode the air in bumps and dips and over curbs and now and then uphill. The whale speeding along on the whale path, as Beowulf called it. Armand\u0027s hair was brushed to one side, neatly. Gold watch on his wrist, one of those high-tech numbers he so adored. Think of that thing flashing its digits inside a coffin during the day. And the black jacket, old-fashioned rather with narrow lapels. The vest was black silk, it looked like that anyway. But his face, ah, he had fed all right. Fed plenty. Do you remember anything I said to you earlier? \"Yes,\" Daniel said. But the truth is he had trouble remembering. Then it came back suddenly, oppressively. \"Something about destruction everywhere. But I\u0027m dying. They\u0027re dying, I\u0027m dying. They got to be immortal before it happened; I am merely alive. See? I remember. I would like to have the bourbon now.\" There is nothing I can do to make you want to live, isn\u0027t that so? \"Not that again. I will jump out of the plane if you go on.\" Will you listen to me, then? Really listen? \"How can I help it? 1 can\u0027t get away from your voice when you want me to listen; it\u0027s like a tiny microphone inside my head. What is this, tears? You\u0027re going to weep over me?\" For one second, he looked so young. What a travesty. \"Damn you, Daniel,\" he said, so that Daniel heard the words aloud. A chill passed over Daniel. Horrid to see him suffering. Daniel said nothing.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-queen-of-the-damned-the-vampire-chronicles-3/page-10.html","bookId":2211,"book":{"id":2211,"title":"The Queen Of The Damned (The Vampire Chronicles #3)","description":"Storyline: The Queen of the Damned (The Vampire Chronicles #3) The Queen of the Damned is the third novel of Anne Rice\u0027s The Vampire Chronicles series.
