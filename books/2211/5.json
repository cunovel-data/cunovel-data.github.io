{"id":102365,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"BABY JENKS PUSHED HER HARLEY TO SEVENTY miles an hour, the wind freezing her naked white hands. She\u0027d been fourteen last summer when they\u0027d done it to her, made her one of the Dead, and \"dead weight\" she was eighty-five pounds max. She hadn\u0027t combed out her hair since it happened-didn\u0027t have to-and her two little blond braids were swept back by the wind, off the shoulders of her black leather jacket. Bent forward, scowling with her little pouting mouth turned down, she looked mean, and deceptively cute. Her big blue eyes were vacant.\n The rock music of The Vampire Lestat was blaring through her earphones, so she felt nothing but the vibration of the giant motorcycle under her, and the mad lonesomeness she had known all the way from Gun Barrel City five nights ago. And there was a dream that was bothering her, a dream she kept having every night right before she opened her eyes.\n She\u0027d see these redheaded twins in the dream, these two pretty ladies, and then all these terrible things would go down. No, she didn\u0027t like it one damn bit and she was so lonely she was going out of her head.\n The Fang Gang hadn\u0027t met her south of Dallas as they had promised. She had waited two nights by the graveyard, then she had known that something was really, really wrong. They would never have headed out to California without her. They were going to see the Vampire Lestat on stage in San Francisco, but they\u0027d had plenty of time. No, something was wrong. She knew it.\n Even when she had been alive, Baby Jenks could feel things like that. And now that she was Dead it was ten times what it had been then. She knew the Fang Gang was in deep trouble. Killer and Davis would never have dumped her. Killer said he loved her. Why the hell else would he have ever made her, if he didn\u0027t love her? She would have died in Detroit if it hadn\u0027t been for Killer.\n She\u0027d been bleeding to death, the doctor had done it to her all right, the baby was gone and all, but she was going to die too, he\u0027d cut something in there, and she was so high on heroin she didn\u0027t give a damn. And then that funny thing happened. Floating up to the ceiling and looking down at her body! And it wasn\u0027t the drugs either. Seemed to her like a whole lot of other things were about to happen.\n But down there, Killer had come into the room and from up where she was floating she could see that he was a Dead guy. Course she didn\u0027t know what he called himself then. She just knew he wasn\u0027t alive. Otherwise he just looked kind of ordinary. Black jeans, black hair, real deep black eyes. He had \"Fang Gang\" written on the back of his leather jacket. He\u0027d sat down on the bed by her body and bent over it.\n \"Ain\u0027t you cute, little girl!\" he\u0027d said. Same damn thing the pimp had said to her when he made her braid her hair and put plastic barrettes in it before she went out on the street.\n Then whoom! She was back in her body all right, and she was just full of something warmer and better than horse and she heard him say: \"You\u0027re not going to die, Baby Jenks, not ever!\" She had her teeth in his goddamn neck, and boy, was that heaven!\n But the never dying part? She wasn\u0027t so sure now.\n Before she\u0027d lit out of Dallas, giving up on the Fang Gang for good, she\u0027d seen the coven house on Swiss Avenue burnt to timbers. All the glass blown out of the windows. It had been the same in Oklahoma City. What the hell had happened to all those Dead guys in those houses? And they were the big city bloodsuckers, too, the smart ones that called themselves vampires.\n How she\u0027d laughed when Killer and Davis had told her that, that those Dead guys went around in three-piece suits and listened to classical music and called themselves vampires. Baby Jenks could have laughed herself to death. Davis thought it was pretty funny too, but Killer just kept warning her about them. Stay away from them.\n Killer and Davis, and Tim and Russ, had taken her by the Swiss Avenue coven house just before she left them to go to Gun Barrel City.\n \"You got to always know where it is,\" Davis had said. \"Then stay away from it.\"\n They\u0027d showed her the coven houses in every big city they hit. But it was when they showed her the first one in St. Louis that they\u0027d told her the whole story.\n She\u0027d been real happy with the Fang Gang since they left Detroit, feeding off the men they lured out of the roadside beer joints. Tim and Russ were OK guys, but Killer and Davis were her special friends and they were the leaders of the Fang Gang.\n Now and then they\u0027d gone into town and found some little shack of a place, all deserted, with maybe two bums in there or something, men who looked kinda like her dad, wearing bill caps and with real calloused hands from the work they did. And they\u0027d have a feast in there on those guys. You could always live off that kind, Killer told her, because nobody gives a damn what happens to them. They\u0027d strike fast, kachoom!-drinking the blood quick, draining them right down to the last heartbeat. It wasn\u0027t fun to torture people like that, Killer said. You had to feel sorry for them. You did what you did, then you burnt down the shack, or you took them outside and dug a hole real deep and stuck them down there. And if you couldn\u0027t do anything like that to cover it up, you did this little trick: cut your finger, let your Dead blood run over the bite where you\u0027d sucked them dry, and look at that, the little puncture wounds just like to vanished. Flash! Nobody\u0027d ever figure it out; it looked like stroke or heart attack.\n Baby Jenks had been having a ball. She could handle a full-sized Harley, carry a dead body with one arm, leap over the hood of a car, it was fantastic. And she hadn\u0027t had the damn dream then, the dream that had started up in Gun Barrel City-with those redheaded twins and that woman\u0027s body lying on an altar. What were they doing?\n What would she do now if she couldn\u0027t find the Fang Gang? Out in California the Vampire Lestat was going on stage two \u0027 nights from now. And every Dead guy in creation would be there, leastways that\u0027s how she figured it, and that\u0027s how the Fang Gang had figured it and they were all supposed to be together. So what the hell was she doing lost from the Fang Gang and headed for a jerkwater city like St. Louis?\n All she wanted was for everything to be like it had been before, goddamn it. Oh, the blood was good, yum, it was so good, even now that she was alone and had to work up her nerve, the way it had been this evening, to pull into a gas station and lure the old guy out back. Oh, yeah, snap, when she\u0027d gotten her hands on his neck, and the blood came, it had been just fine, it was hamburgers and french fries and strawberry shakes, it was beer and chocolate sundaes. It was mainline, and coke and hash. It was better than screwing! It was all of it.\n But everything had been better when the Fang Gang was with her. And they had understood when she got tired of the chewed-up old guys and said she wanted to taste something young and tender. No problem. Hey, it was a nice little runaway kid she needed, Killer said. Just close your eyes and wish. And sure enough, like that, they found him hitchhiking on the main road, just five miles out of some town in northern Missouri, name of Parker. Real pretty boy with long shaggy black hair, just twelve years old, but real tall for his age, with some beard on his chin, and trying to pass for sixteen. He\u0027d climbed on her bike and they\u0027d taken him into the woods. Then Baby Jenks laid down with him, real gentle like, and slurp, that was it for Parker.\n It was delicious all right, juicy was the word. But she didn\u0027t know really whether it was any better than the mean old guys when you got down to it. And with them it was more sport. Good ole boy blood, Davis called it.\n Davis was a black Dead guy and one damned good-looking black Dead guy, as Baby Jenks saw it. His skin had a gold glow to it, the Dead glow which in the case of white Dead guys made them look like they were standing in a fluorescent light all the time. Davis had beautiful eyelashes too, just damn near unbelievably long and thick, and he decked himself out in all the gold he could find. He stole the gold rings and watches and chains and things off the victims.\n Davis loved to dance. They all loved to dance. But Davis could outdance any of them. They\u0027d go to the graveyards to dance, maybe round three a.m., after they\u0027d all fed and buried the dead and all that jazz. They\u0027d set the ghetto blaster radio on a tombstone and turn it way up, with the Vampire Lestat roaring. \"The Grand Sabbat\" song, that was the one that was good for dancing. And oh, man, how good it felt, twisting and turning and leaping in the air, or just watching Davis move and Killer move and Russ spinning in circles till he fell down. Now that was real Dead guy dancing.\n Now if those big city bloodsuckers weren\u0027t hip to that, they were crazy.\n God, she wished now that she could tell Davis about this dream she\u0027d been having since Gun Barrel City. How it had come to her in her mom\u0027s trailer, zap, the first time when she\u0027d been sitting waiting. It was so clear for a dream, those two women with the red hair, and the body lying there with its skin all black and crackled like. And what the hell was that on the plates in the dream? Yeah, it had been a heart on one plate and a brain on the other. Christ. All those people kneeling around that body and those plates. It was creepy. And she\u0027d had it over and over again since then. Why, she was having it every goddamn time she shut her eyes and again right before she dug her way out of wherever she\u0027d been hiding by daylight.\n Killer and Davis would understand. They\u0027d know if it meant something. They wanted to teach her everything.\n When they first hit St. Louis on their way south, the Fang Gang had headed off the boulevard into one of those big dark streets with iron gates that they call \"a private place\" in St. Louis. It was the Central West End down here, they said. Baby Jenks had liked those big trees. There just aren\u0027t enough big trees in south Texas. There wasn\u0027t much of nothing in south Texas. And here the trees were so big their branches made a roof over your head. And the streets were full of noisy rustling leaves and the houses were big, with peaked roofs and the lights buried deep inside them. The coven house was made of brick and had what Killer called Moorish arches.\n \"Don\u0027t go any closer,\" Davis had said. Killer just laughed. Killer wasn\u0027t scared of the big city Dead. Killer had been made sixty years ago, he was old. He knew everything.\n \"But they will try to hurt you, Baby Jenks,\" he said, walking his Harley just a little farther up the street. He had a lean long face, wore a gold earring in his ear, and his eyes were small, kind of thoughtful. \"See, this one\u0027s an old coven, been in St. Louis since the turn of the century.\"\n \"But why would they want to hurt us?\" Baby Jenks had asked. She was real curious about that house. What did the Dead do who lived in houses? What kind of furniture did they have? Who paid the bills, for God\u0027s sakes?\n Seems like she could see a chandelier in one of those front rooms, through the curtains. A big fancy chandelier. Man! Now that\u0027s living.\n \"Oh, they got all that down,\" said Davis, reading her mind. \"You don\u0027t think the neighbors think they\u0027re real people? Look at that car in the drive, you know what that is? That\u0027s a Bugatti, baby. And the other one beside it, a Mercedes-Benz.\"\n What the hell was wrong with a pink Cadillac? That\u0027s what she\u0027d like to have, a big gas-guzzling convertible that she could push to a hundred and twenty on the open stretch. And that\u0027s what had got her into trouble, got her to Detroit, an asshole with a Cadillac convertible. But just \u0027cause you were Dead didn\u0027t mean you had to drive a Harley and sleep in the dirt every day, did it?\n \"We\u0027re free, darlin\u0027,\" Davis said, reading her thoughts. \"Don\u0027t you see? There\u0027s a lotta baggage goes with this big city life. Tell her, Killer. And you ain\u0027t getting me in no house like that, sleeping in a box under the floorboards.\"\n He broke up. Killer broke up. She broke up too. But what the hell was it like in there? Did they turn on the late show and watch the vampire movies? Davis was really rolling on the ground.\n \"The fact is, Baby Jenks,\" Killer said, \"we\u0027re rogues to them, they wanna run everything. Like they don\u0027t think we have a right to be Dead. Like when they make a new vampire as they call it, it\u0027s a big ceremony.\"\n \"Like what happens, like a wedding or something you mean?\"\n More laughter from those two.\n \"Not exactly,\" Killer said, \"more like a funeral!\"\n They were making too much noise. Surely those Dead guys in the house were going to hear them. But Baby Jenks wasn\u0027t afraid if Killer wasn\u0027t afraid. Where were Russ and Tim, gone off hunting?\n \"But the point is, Baby Jenks,\" said Killer, \"they have all these rules, and I\u0027ll tell you what, they\u0027re spreading it all over that they\u0027re going to get the Vampire Lestat the night of his concert, but you know what, they\u0027re reading his book like it was the Bible.\n They\u0027re using all that language he used, Dark Gift, Dark Trick, I tell you it\u0027s the stupidest thing I\u0027ve ever seen, they\u0027re going to burn the guy at the stake and then use his book like it was Emily Post or Miss Manners-\"\n \"They\u0027ll never get Lestat,\" Davis had sneered. \"No way, man. You can\u0027t kill the Vampire Lestat, that is flat out impossible. It has been tried, you see, and it has failed. Now that is one cat who is utterly and completely immortal.\"\n \"Hell, they\u0027re going out there same as we are,\" Killer said, \"to join up with the cat if he wants us.\"\n Baby Jenks didn\u0027t understand the whole thing. She didn\u0027t know who Emily Post was or Miss Manners either. And weren\u0027t we all supposed to be immortal? And why would the Vampire Lestat want to be running around with the Fang Gang? I mean he was a rock star, for Chrissakes. Probably had his own limousine. And was he ever one adorable-looking guy, Dead or alive! Blond hair to die for and a smile that just made you wanna roll over and let him bite your goddamn neck!\n She\u0027d tried to read the Vampire Lestat\u0027s book-the whole history of Dead guys back to ancient times and all-but there were just too many big words and konk, she was asleep.\n Killer and Davis said she\u0027d find out she could read real fast now if she just stuck with it. They carried copies of Lestat\u0027s book around with them, and the first one, the one with the title she could never get straight, something like \"conversations with the vampire,\" or \"talking with the vampire,\" or \"getting to meet the vampire,\" or something like that. Davis would read out loud from that one sometimes, but Baby Jenks couldn\u0027t take it in, snore! The Dead Guy, Louis, or whoever he was, had been made Dead down in New Orleans and the book was full of stuff about banana leaves and iron railings and Spanish moss.\n \"Baby Jenks, they know everything, the old European ones,\" Davis had said. \"They know how it started, they know we can go on and on if we hang in there, live to be a thousand years old and turn into white marble.\"\n \"Gee, that\u0027s just great, Davis,\" Baby Jenks said. \"It\u0027s bad enough now not being able to walk into a Seven Eleven under those lights without people looking at you. Who wants to look like white marble?\"\n \"Baby Jenks, you don\u0027t need anything anymore from the Seven Eleven,\" Davis said real calmly. But he got the point.\n Forget the books. Baby Jenks did love the Vampire Lestat\u0027s music, and those songs just kept giving her a lot, especially that one about Those Who Must Be Kept-the Egyptian King and Queen-though to tell the truth she didn\u0027t know what the hell it meant till Killer explained.\n \"They\u0027re the parents of all vampires, Baby Jenks, the Mother and the Father. See, we\u0027re all an unbroken line of blood coming down from the King and the Queen in ancient Egypt who are called Those Who Must Be Kept. And the reason you gotta keep them is if you destroy them, you destroy all of us, too.\"\n Sounded like a bunch of bull to her.\n \"Lestat\u0027s seen the Mother and the Father,\" Davis said. \"Found them hidden on a Greek island, so he knows that it\u0027s the truth. That\u0027s what he\u0027s been telling everybody with these songs-and it\u0027s the truth.\"\n \"And the Mother and the Father don\u0027t move or speak or drink blood, Baby Jenks,\" Killer said. He looked real thoughtful, sad, almost. \"They just sit there and stare like they\u0027ve done for thousands of years. Nobody knows what those two know.\"\n \"Probably nothing,\" Baby Jenks had said disgustedly. \"And I tell you, this is some kind of being immortal! What do you mean the big city Dead guys can kill us? Just how can they manage that?\"\n \"Fire and sun can always do it,\" Killer answered just a touch impatient. \"I told you that. Now mind me, please. You can always fight the big city Dead guys. You\u0027re tough. Fact is, the big city Dead are as scared of you as you will ever be of them. You just beat it when you see a Dead guy you don\u0027t know. That\u0027s a rule that\u0027s followed by everybody who\u0027s Dead.\"\n After they\u0027d left the coven house, she\u0027d got another big surprise from Killer: he\u0027d told her about the vampire bars. Big fancy places in New York and San Francisco and New Orleans, where the Dead guys met in the back rooms while the damn fool human beings drank and danced up front. In there, no other Dead guy could kill you, city slicker, European, or rogue like her.\n \"You run for one of those places,\" he told her, \"if the big city Dead guys ever get on your case.\"\n \"I\u0027m not old enough to go in a bar,\" Baby Jenks said.\n That really did it. He and Davis laughed themselves sick. They were falling off their motorcycles.\n \"You find a vampire bar, Baby Jenks,\" Killer said, \"you just give them the Evil Eye and say \u0027Let me in.\u0027\"\n Yeah, she\u0027d done that Evil Eye on people and made them do stuff, it worked OK. And truth was, they\u0027d never seen the vampire bars. Just heard about them. Didn\u0027t know where they were. She\u0027d had lots of questions when they finally left St. Louis.\n But as she made her way north towards the same city now, the only thing in the world she cared about was getting to that same damned coven house. Big city Dead guys, here I come. She\u0027d go clean out of her head if she had to go on alone.\n The music in the earphones stopped. The tape had run out. She couldn\u0027t stand the silence in the roar of the wind. The dream came back; she saw those twins again, the soldiers coming. Jesus. If she didn\u0027t block it out, the whole damn dream would replay itself like the tape.\n Steadying the bike with one hand, she reached in her jacket to open the little cassette player. She flipped the tape over. \"Sing on, man!\" she said, her voice sounding shrill and tiny to her over the roar of the wind, if she heard it at all.\n Of Those Who Must Be Kept\n What can we know?\n Can any explanation save us?\n Yes sir, that was the one she loved. That\u0027s the one she\u0027d been listening to when she fell asleep waiting for her mother to come home from work in Gun Barrel City. It wasn\u0027t the words that got to her, it was the way he sang it, groaning like Bruce Springsteen into the mike and making it just break your heart.\n It was kind of like a hymn in a way. It had that kind of sound, yet Lestat was right there in the middle of it, singing to her, and there was a steady drumbeat that went to her bones.\n \"OK, man, OK, you\u0027re the only goddamn Dead guy I\u0027ve got now, Lestat, keep singing!\"\n Five minutes to St. Louis, and there she was thinking about her mother again, how strange it had all been, how bad.\n Baby Jenks hadn\u0027t even told Killer or Davis why she was going home, though they knew, they understood.\n Baby Jenks had to do it, she had to get her parents before the Fang Gang went out west. And even now she didn\u0027t regret it. Except for that strange moment when her mother was dying there on the floor.\n Now Baby Jenks had always hated her mother. She thought her mother was just a real fool, making crosses every day of her life with little pink seashells and bits of glass and then taking them to the Gun Barrel City Flea Market and selling them for ten dollars. And they were ugly, too, just real ready-made junk, those things with a little twisted-up Jesus in the middle made up of tiny red and blue beads and things.\n But it wasn\u0027t just that, it was everything her mother had ever done that got to Baby Jenks and made her disgusted. Going to church, that was bad enough, but talking the way she did to people so sweet and just putting up with her husband\u0027s drinking and always saying nice things about everybody.\n Baby Jenks never bought a word of it. She used to lie there on her bunk in the trailer thinking to herself, What really makes that lady tick? When is she going to blow up like a stick of dynamite? Or is she just too stupid? Her mother had stopped looking Baby Jenks in the eye years ago. When Baby Jenks was twelve she\u0027d come in and said, \"You know I done it, don\u0027t you? I hope to God you don\u0027t think I\u0027m no virgin.\" And her mother just faded out, like, just looked away with her eyes wide and empty and stupid, and went back to her work, humming like always as she made those seashell crosses.\n One time some big city person told her mother that she made real folk art. \"They\u0027re making a fool of you,\" Baby Jenks had said. \"Don\u0027t you know that? They didn\u0027t buy one of those ugly things, did they? You know what those things look like to me? I\u0027ll tell you what they look like. They look like great big dime-store earrings!\"\n No arguing. Just turning the other cheek. \"You want some supper, honey?\"\n It was like an open and shut case, Baby Jenks figured. So she had headed out of Dallas early, making Cedar Creek Lake in less than an hour, and there was the familiar sign that meant her sweet little old home town:\n WELCOME TO GUN BARREL CITY. WE SHOOT STRAIGHT WITH YOU.\n She hid her Harley behind the trailer when she got there, nobody home, and lay down for a nap, Lestat singing in the earphones, and the steam iron ready by her side. When her mother came in, slam bam, thank you, ma\u0027am, she\u0027d take her out with it.\n Then the dream happened. Why, she wasn\u0027t even asleep when it started. It was like Lestat faded out, and the dream pulled her down and snap:\n She was in a place full of sunlight. A clearing on the side of a mountain. And these two twins were there, beautiful women with soft wavy red hair, and they knelt like angels in church with their hands folded. Lots of people around, people in long robes, like people in the Bible. And there was music, too, a creepy thumping and the sound of a horn playing, real mournful. But the worst part was the dead body, the burned body of the woman on a stone slab. Why, she looked like she\u0027d been cooked, lying there! And on the plates, there was a fat shiny heart and a brain. Yep, sure thing, that was a heart and a brain.\n Baby Jenks had woken up, scared. To hell with that. Her mother was standing in the door. Baby Jenks jumped up and banged her with the steam iron till she stopped moving. Really bashed in her head. And she should have been dead, but she wasn\u0027t yet, and then that crazy moment came.\n Her mother was lying there on the floor, half dead, staring, just like her daddy would be later. And Baby Jenks was sitting in the chair, one blue jean leg thrown over the arm, leaning on her elbow, or twirling one of her braids, just waiting, thinking about the twins in the dream sort of, and the body and the things on the plates, what was it all for? But mostly just waiting. Die, you stupid bitch, go on, die, I\u0027m not slamming you again!\n Even now Baby Jenks wasn\u0027t sure what had happened. It was like her mother\u0027s thoughts had changed, grown wider, bigger. Maybe she was floating up on the ceiling somewhere the way Baby Jenks had been when she nearly died before Killer saved her. But whatever was the cause, the thoughts were just amazing. Just flat out amazing. Like her mother knew everything! All about good and bad and how important it was to love, really love, and how it was so much more than just all the rules about don\u0027t drink, don\u0027t smoke, pray to Jesus. It wasn\u0027t preacher stuff. It was just gigantic.\n Her mother, lying there, had thought about how the lack of love in her daughter, Baby Jenks, had been as awful as a bad gene that made Baby Jenks blind and crippled. Yet it didn\u0027t matter. It was going to be all right. Baby Jenks would rise out of what was going on now, just as she had almost done before Killer had got to her, and there would be a finer understanding of everything. What the hell did that mean? Something about everything around us being part of one big thing, the fibers in the carpet, the leaves outside the window, the water dripping in the sink, the clouds moving over Cedar Creek Lake, and the bare trees, and they weren\u0027t really so ugly as Baby Jenks had thought. No, the whole thing was almost too beautiful to describe suddenly. And Baby Jenks\u0027 mother had always known about this! Seen it that way. Baby Jenks\u0027s mother forgave Baby Jenks everything. Poor Baby Jenks. She didn\u0027t know. She didn\u0027t know about the green grass. Or the seashells shining in the light of the lamp.\n Then Baby Jenks\u0027s mother had died. Thank God! Enough! But Baby Jenks had been crying. Then she\u0027d carried the body out of the trailer and buried it in back, real deep, feeling how good it was to be one of the Dead and so strong and able to just heft those shovels full of dirt.\n Then her father came home. This one\u0027s really for fun! She buried him while he was still alive. She\u0027d never forget the look on his face when he came in the door and saw her with the fire ax. \"Well, if it ain\u0027t Lizzie Borden.\"\n Who the hell was Lizzie Borden?\n Then the way his chin stuck out, and his fist came flying towards her, he was so sure of himself! \"You little slut!\" She split his goddamn forehead in half. Yeah, that part was great, feeling the skull cave-\"Go down, you bastard!\"-and so was shoveling dirt on his face while he was still looking at her. Paralyzed, couldn\u0027t move, thinking he was a kid again on a farm or something in New Mexico. Just baby talk. You son of a bitch, I always knew you had shit for brains. Now I can smell it!\n But why the hell had she ever gone down there? Why had she left the Fang Gang?\n If she\u0027d never left them, she\u0027d be with them now in San Francisco, with Killer and Davis, waiting to see Lestat on the stage. They might have even made the vampire bar out there or something. Leastways, if they had ever gotten there. If something wasn\u0027t really really wrong.\n And what the hell was she doing now backtracking? Maybe she should have gone along out west. Two nights, that was all that was left.\n Hell, maybe she\u0027d rent a motel room when the concert happened, so she could watch it on TV. But before that, she had to find some Dead guys in St. Louis. She couldn\u0027t go on alone.\n How to find the Central West End. Where was it?\n This boulevard looked familiar. She was cruising along, praying no meddling cop would start after her. She\u0027d outrun him of course, she always did, though she dreamed of getting just one of those damn sons-a-bitches on a lonely road. But the fact was she didn\u0027t want to be chased out of St. Louis.\n Now this looked like something she knew. Yeah, this was the Central West End or whatever they called it and she turned off now to the right and went down an old street with those big cool leafy trees all around her. Made her think of her mother again, the green grass, the clouds. Little sob in her throat.\n If she just wasn\u0027t so damn lonesome! But then she saw the gates, yeah, this was the street. Killer had told her that Dead guys never really forget anything. Her brain would be like a little computer. Maybe it was true. These were the gates all right, great big iron gates, opened wide and covered with dark green ivy. Guess they never really close up \"a private place.\"\n She slowed to a rumbling crawl, then cut the motor altogether. Too noisy in this dark valley of mansions. Some bitch might call the cops. She had to get off to walk her bike. Her legs weren\u0027t long enough to do it any other way. But that was OK. She liked walking in these deep dead leaves. She liked this whole quiet street.\n Boy, if I was a big city vampire I\u0027d live here too, she thought, and then far off down the street, she saw the coven house, saw the brick walls and the white Moorish arches.
