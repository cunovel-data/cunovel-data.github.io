{"id":102375,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"Mael, for instance, a tall overpowering man with long wavy blond hair and deep-set blue eyes. There had been something almost eerie about the way he moved, the timbre of his voice, the precise way he handled the car as they drove north to Sonoma County. He\u0027d worn the rawhide clothes of a rancher it seemed, even to the alligator boots, except for a pair of exquisite black kid gloves and a large pair of gold-rimmed blue-tinted glasses.\\n\\n And yet he\u0027d been so cheerful, so glad to see her, and she\u0027d liked him immediately. She\u0027d told him the story of her life before they reached Santa Rosa. He had the most lovely laugh. But Jesse had gotten positively dizzy looking at him once or twice. Why? The compound itself was unbelievable. Who could have built such a place? It was at the end of an impossible unpaved road, to begin with; and its back rooms had been dug out of the mountain, as if by enormous machines. Then there were the roof timbers. Were they primeval redwood? They must have been twelve feet in girth. And the adobe walls, positively ancient. Had there been Europeans in California so long ago that they could have . . . but what did it matter? The place was magnificent, finally. She loved the round iron hearths and animal-skin rugs, and the huge library and the crude observatory with its ancient brass telescope.\\n\\n She had loved the good-hearted servants who came each morning from Santa Rosa to clean, do laundry, prepare the sumptuous meals. It did not even bother her that she was alone so much. She loved walking in the forest. She went into Santa Rosa for novels and newspapers. She studied the tapestried quilts. There were ancient artifacts here she could not identify; which she loved examining. Aerials high on the maintain brought television broadcasts from far and wide. There was a cellar movie theater complete with projector, screen, and n immense collection of films. On warm afternoons she swam in the pond to the south of the house. As dusk fell bringing the inevitable northern California chill, huge fires blazed in every room of the house. Of course the grandest discovery for her had been the family history that there were countless leader volumes tracing the lineage of all the branches of the Great family for centuries back. She was thrilled to discover photograph albums by the hundreds, and trunks full of painted portraits, some no more than tiny oval miniatures others large canvases now layered with dust.\\n\\n At once she devoured the history of the Reeveses of South Carolina, her own people-rich before the Civil War, and ruined after Their photographs were almost more than she could bear. Here at last were the forebears she truly resembled; she could see her features in their faces. They had her pale skin even her expression! And two of them had her long curly red hair. To Jesse an adopted child, this had a very special significance.\\n\\n It was only towards the end of her stay that Jesse began to realize the implications of the family records, as she opened scrolls covered with ancient Latin, Greek, and finally Egyptian hieroglyphics Never afterwards was she able to pinpoint the discovery of the clay tablets deep within the cellar room. But the recovery of the memory of her conversations with Maharet were never clouded. They\u0027d talked for hours about the family chronicles.\\n\\n Jesse had begged to work with the family history. She would have given up school for this library. She wanted to translate and adapt the old records and feed them into computers. Why not publish the story of the Great Family? For surely such a long lineage was highly unusual, if not absolutely unique! Even the crowned heads of Europe could not trace themselves this far back.\\n\\n Maharet had been patient with Jesses enthusiasm, reminding her that it was time-consuming and unrewarding work. After all, it was only the story of one family\u0027s progress through the centuries- sometimes there were only lists of names in the record or short descriptions of uneventful lives, tallies of births and deaths, and records of migration.\\n\\n Good memories, those conversations. And the soft mellow light of the library, the delicious smells of the old leather and parchment, of the candles and the blazing fire. And Maharet by the hearth, the lovely manikin, her pale green eyes covered with large faintly tinted glasses, cautioning Jesse that the work might engulf her, keep her from better things. It was the Great Family that mattered, not the record of it, it was the vitality in each generation, and the knowledge and love of one\u0027s kin. The record merely made this possible.\\n\\n Jesse\u0027s longing for this work was greater than anything she\u0027d ever known. Surely Maharet would let her stay here! She\u0027d have years in this library, discovering finally the very origins of the family!\\n\\n Only afterwards did she see it as an astounding mystery, and one among many during that summer. Only afterwards, had so many little things preyed on her mind.\\n\\n For example, Maharet and Mael simply never appeared until after dark, and the explanation-they slept all day-was no explanation at all. And where did they sleep?-that was another question. Their rooms lay empty all day with the doors open, the closets overflowing with exotic and spectacular clothes. At sunset they would appear almost as if they\u0027d materialized. Jesse would look up. Maharet would be standing by the hearth, her makeup elaborate and flawless, her clothes dramatic, her jeweled earrings and necklace sparkling in the broken light. Mael, dressed as usual in soft brown buckskin jacket and pants, stood silently against the wall.\\n\\n But when Jesse asked about their strange hours, Maharet\u0027s answers were utterly convincing! They were pale beings, they detested sunlight, and they did stay up so late! True. Why, at four in the morning, they were still arguing with each other about politics or history, and from such a bizarre and grand perspective, calling cities by their ancient names, and sometimes speaking in a rapid, strange tongue that Jesse could not classify, let alone understand. With her psychic gift, she sometimes knew what they were saying; but the strange sounds baffled her.\\n\\n And something about Mael rankled Maharet, it was obvious. Was he her lover? It did not really seem so.\\n\\n Then it was the way that Mael and Maharet kept speaking to each other, as if they were reading each other\u0027s minds. All of a sudden, Mael would say, \"But I told you not to worry,\" when in fact Maharet had not said a word out loud. And sometimes they did it with Jesse too. One time, Jesse was certain, Maharet had called her, asked her to come down to the main dining hall, though Jesse could have sworn she heard the voice only in her head. Of course Jesse was psychic. But were Mael and Maharet both powerful psychics as well?\\n\\n Dinner: that was another thing-the way that Jesse\u0027s favorite dishes appeared. She didn\u0027t have to tell the servants what she liked and didn\u0027t like. They knew! Escargots, baked oysters, fettucini alia carbonara, beef Wellington, any and all her favorites were the nightly fare. And the wine, she had never tasted such delicious vintages. Yet Maharet and Mael ate like birds, or so it seemed. Sometimes they sat out the entire meal with their gloves on.\\n\\n And the strange visitors, what about them? Santino, for instance, a black-haired Italian, who arrived one evening on foot, with a youthful companion named Eric. Santino had stared at Jesse as if she were an exotic animal, then he\u0027d kissed her hand and given her a gorgeous emerald ring, which had disappeared without explanation several nights later. For two hours Santino had argued with Maharet in that same unusual language, then left in a rage, with the flustered Eric.\\n\\n Then there were the strange nighttime parties. Hadn\u0027t Jesse awakened twice at three or four in the morning to find the house full of people? There had been people laughing and talking in every room. And all of these people had something in common. They were very pale with remarkable eyes, much like Mael and Maharet. But Jesse had been so sleepy. She couldn\u0027t even remember going back to bed. Only that at one point she had been surrounded by several very beautiful young men who filled a glass of wine for her, and the next thing she knew it was morning. She was in bed. The sun was pouring through the window. The house was empty.\\n\\n Also, Jesse had heard things at odd hours. The roar of helicopters, small planes. Yet no one said a word about such things.\\n\\n But Jesse was so happy! These things seemed of no consequence! Maharet\u0027s answers would banish Jesse\u0027s doubts in an instant. Yet how unusual that Jesse would change her mind like that. Jesse was such a confident person. Her own feelings were often known to her at once. She was actually rather stubborn.\\n\\n And yet she always had two attitudes towards various things Maharet told her. On the one hand, \"Why, that\u0027s ridiculous,\" and on the other, \"Of course!\"\\n\\n But Jesse was having too much fun to care. She spent the first few evenings of her visit talking with Maharet and Mael about archaeology. And Maharet was a fund of information though she had some very strange ideas.\\n\\n For example, she maintained that the discovery of agriculture had actually come about because tribes who lived very well by hunting wanted to have hallucinogenic plants ever available to them for religious trances. And also they wanted beer. Never mind that there wasn\u0027t a shred of archaeological evidence. Just keep digging. Jesse would find out.\\n\\n Mael read poetry out loud beautifully; Maharet sometimes played the piano, very slowly, meditatively. Eric reappeared for a couple of nights, joining them enthusiastically in their singing. He\u0027d brought films with him from Japan and Italy, and they\u0027d had a splendid time watching these. Kwaidan, in particular, had been quite impressive, though frightening. And the Italian Juliet of the Spirits had made Jesse break into tears.\\n\\n All of these people seemed to find Jesse interesting. In fact, Mael asked her incredibly odd questions. Had she ever in her life smoked a cigarette? What did chocolate taste like? How could she dare to go with young men alone in automobiles or to their apartments? Didn\u0027t she realize they might kill her? She had almost laughed. No, but seriously, that could happen, he insisted. He worked himself into a state over it. Look at the papers. Women of the modern cities were hunted by men like deer in the wood.\\n\\n Best to get him off that subject, and onto his travels. His descriptions of all the places he\u0027d been were marvelous. He\u0027d lived for years in the jungles of the Amazon. Yet he would not fly in \"an aeroplane.\" That was too dangerous. What if it exploded? And he didn\u0027t like \"cloth garments\" because they were too fragile.\\n\\n Jesse had a very peculiar moment with Mael. They\u0027d been talking together at the dining table. She\u0027d been explaining about the ghosts she sometimes saw, and he had referred to these crossly as the addlebrained dead, or the insane dead, which had made her laugh in spite of herself. But it was true; ghosts did behave as if they were a little addlebrained, that was the horror of it. Do we cease to exist when we die? Or do we linger in a stupid state, appearing to people at odd moments and making nonsensical remarks to mediums? When had a ghost ever said anything interesting?\\n\\n \"But they are merely the earthbound, of course,\" Mael had said, \"Who knows where we go when we at last let loose of the flesh and all its seductive pleasures?\"\\n\\n Jesse had been quite drunk by this time, and she felt a a terrible dread coming over her-thoughts of the old ghost mansion of Stanford White, and the spirits roaming the New York crowds, She\u0027d focused sharply upon Mael, who for once was not wearing his gloves or his tinted glasses. Handsome Mael, whose eyes were very blue except for a bit of blackness at the centers.\\n\\n \"Besides,\" Mael had said, \"there are other spirits who have always been here. They were never flesh and blood; and it makes them so angry.\"\\n\\n What a curious idea. \"How do you know this?\" Jesse had asked, still staring at Mael. Mael was beautiful. The beauty was the sum of the faults-the hawk nose, the too prominent jaw, the leanness of the face with the wild wavy straw-colored hair around it. Even the eyes were too deep-set, yet all the more visible for it. Yes, beautiful-to embrace, to kiss, to invite to bed ... In fact, the attraction she\u0027d always felt to him was suddenly overwhelming.\\n\\n Then, an odd realization had seized her. This isn\u0027t a human being. This is something pretending to be a human being. It was so clear. But it was also ridiculous! If it wasn\u0027t a human being, what the hell was it? It certainly was no ghost or spirit. That was obvious.\\n\\n \"I guess we don\u0027t know what\u0027s real or unreal,\" she had said without meaning to. \"You stare at anything long enough and suddenly it looks monstrous.\" She had in fact turned away from him to stare at the bowl of flowers in the middle of the table. Old tea roses, falling to pieces amid the baby\u0027s breath and fern and purple zinnias. And they did look absolutely alien, these things, the way that insects always do, and sort of horrible! What were these things, really? Then the bowl broke into pieces and the water went everywhere. And Mael had said quite sincerely, \"Oh, forgive me. I didn\u0027t mean to do that.\"\\n\\n Now that had happened, without question. Yet it had made not the slightest impact. Mael had slipped away for a walk in the woods, kissing her forehead before he went, his hand trembling suddenly as he reached to touch her hair and then apparently thought the better of it.\\n\\n Of course, Jesse had been drinking. In fact, Jesse drank too much the entire time she was there. And no one seemed to notice. Now and then they went out and danced in the clearing under the moon. It was not an organized dancing. They would move singly, in circles, gazing up at the sky. Mael would hum or Maharet would sing songs in the unknown language.\\n\\n What had been her state of mind to do such things for hours? And why had she never questioned, even in her mind, Mael\u0027s strange manner of wearing gloves about the house, or walking in the dark with his sunglasses on?\\n\\n Then one morning well before dawn, Jesse had gone to bed drunk and had a terrible dream. Mael and Maharet were fighting with each other. Mael kept saying over and over:\\n\\n \"But what if she dies? What if somebody kills her, or a car hits her? What if, what if, what if...\" It had become a deafening roar. Then several nights later the awful and final catastrophe had begun. Mael had been gone for a while, but then he\u0027d returned. She\u0027d been drinking burgundy all evening long, and she was standing on the terrace with him and he had kissed her and she had lost consciousness and yet she knew what was going on. He was holding her, kissing her breasts, yet she was slipping down through a fathomless darkness. Then the girl had come again, the teenaged girl who\u0027d come to her that time in New York when she was so afraid. Only Maef couldn\u0027t see the girl, and of course Jesse knew exactly who she was, Jesse\u0027s mother, Miriam, and that Miriam was afraid. Mael had suddenly released Jesse. \"Where is she!\" he\u0027d cried out angrily. Jesse had opened her eyes. Maharet was there. She struck Mael so hard he flew backwards over the railing of the terrace. And Jesse screamed, pushing aside the teenaged girl accidentally as she ran to look over the edge.\\n\\n Far down there in the clearing Mael stood, unhurt. Impossible, yet obviously the case. He was on his feet already, and he made Maharet a deep ceremonial bow. He stood in the light falling from the windows of the lower rooms, and he blew a kiss to Maharet. Maharet looked sad, but she smiled. She\u0027d said something under her breath and made a little dismissive gesture to Mael, as if to say she wasn\u0027t angry.\\n\\n Jesse was in a panic that Maharet would be angry with her, but when she looked into Maharet\u0027s eyes she knew that there was no cause for worry. Then Jesse looked down and saw that the front of her dress was torn. She felt a sharp pain where Mae! had been kissing her, and when she turned to Maharet, she became disoriented, unable to hear her own words.\\n\\n She was sitting on her bed somehow, propped against the pillows, and she wore a long flannel gown. She was telling Maharet that her mother had come again, she\u0027d seen her on the terrace. But that was only part of what she\u0027d been saying because she and Maharet had been talking for hours about the whole thing. But what whole thing? Maharet told her she would forget.\\n\\n Oh, God, how she tried to recall after. Bits and pieces had tormented her for years. Maharet\u0027s hair was down, and it was very long and full. They had moved through the dark house together, like ghosts, she and Maharet, Maharet holding her, and now and then stopping to kiss her, and she had hugged Maharet. Maharet\u0027s body felt like stone that could breathe.\\n\\n They were high up in the mountain in a secret room. Massive computers were there, with their reels and red lights, giving off a low electronic hum. And there, on an immense rectangular screen that stretched dozens of feet up the wall, was an enormous family tree drawn electronically by means of light. This was the Great Family, stretching back through all the millennia. Ah, yes, to one root! The plan was matrilineal, which had always been the way with the ancient peoples-as it had been with the Egyptians, yes, descent through the princesses of the royal house. And as it was, after a fashion, with the Hebrew tribes to this day.\\n\\n All the details had been plain to Jesse at this moment-ancient names, places, the beginning!-God, had she known even the beginning?-the staggering reality of hundreds of generations charted before her eyes! She had seen the progress of the family through the ancient countries of Asia Minor and Macedonia and Italy and finally up through Europe and then to the New World! And this could have been the chart of any human family!\\n\\n Never after was she able to reinvoke the details of that electronic map. No, Maharet had told her she would forget it. The miracle was that she remembered anything at all.\\n\\n But what else had happened? What had been the real thrust of their long talk?\\n\\n Maharet crying, that she remembered. Maharet weeping with the soft feminine sound of a young girl. Maharet had never appeared so alluring; her face had been softened, yet luminous, the lines so few and so delicate. But it had been shadowy then, and Jesse could scarcely see anything clearly. She remembered the face burning like a white ember in the darkness, the pale green eyes clouded yet vibrant, and the blond eyelashes glistening as if the tiny hairs had been stroked with gold.\\n\\n Candles burning in her room. The forest rising high outside the window. Jesse had been begging, protesting. But what in God\u0027s name was the argument about?\\n\\n You will forget this. You will remember nothing.\\n\\n She\u0027d known when she opened her eyes in the sunlight that it was over; they had gone. Nothing had come back to her in those first few moments, except that something irrevocable had been said.\\n\\n Then she had found the note on the bedside table:\\n\\n My darling,\\n\\n It is no longer good for you to be around us. I fear we have all become too enamored of you and would sweep you off your feet and take you away from those things which you have set out to do.\\n\\n You will forgive us for leaving so suddenly. I am confident that this is best for you. I have arranged for the car to take you to the airport. Your plane leaves at four o\u0027clock. Your cousins Maria and Matthew will meet you in New York.\\n\\n Be assured I love you more than words can say. My letter will be waiting for you when you reach home. Some night many years from now we will discuss the family history again. You may become my helper with these records if you still wish it. But for now this must not engulf you. It must not lead you away from life itself.\\n\\n Yours always,\\n\\n with unquestioning love,\\n\\n Maharet\\n\\n Jesse had never seen Maharet again.\\n\\n Her letters came with the same old regularity, full of affection, concern, advice. But never again was there to be a visit. Never was Jesse invited back to the house in the Sonoma forest.\\n\\n In the following months, Jesse had been showered with presents-a beautiful old town house on Washington Square in Greenwich Village, a new car, a heady increase in income, and the usual plane tickets to visit members of the family all over the world. Eventually, Maharet underwrote a substantial part of Jesse\u0027s archaeological work at Jericho. In fact, as the years passed she gave Jesse anything and everything Jesse could possibly desire.\\n\\n Nevertheless, Jesse had been damaged by that summer. Once in Damascus she had dreamed of Mael and awakened crying.\\n\\n She was in London, working at the British Museum, when the memories began to come back with full force. She never knew what triggered them. Maybe the effect of Maharet\u0027s admonition-You will forget-had simply worn off. But there might have been another reason. One evening in Trafalgar Square, she\u0027d seen Mael or a man who looked exactly like him. The man, who stood many feet away, had been staring at her when their eyes met. Yet when she\u0027d waved, he\u0027d turned his back and walked off without the slightest recognition. She\u0027d run after him trying to catch up with him; but he was gone as if he\u0027d never been there.\\n\\n It had left her hurt and disappointed. Yet three days later she\u0027d received an anonymous gift, a bracelet of hammered silver. It was an ancient Celtic relic, she soon found out, and probably priceless. Could Mael have sent her this precious and lovely thing? She wanted so to believe it.\\n\\n Holding the bracelet tightly in her hand she felt his presence. She remembered the long ago night when they\u0027d spoken of addle-brained ghosts. She smiled. It was as if he were there, holding her, kissing her. She told Maharet about the gift when she wrote. She wore the bracelet ever after that.\\n\\n Jesse kept a diary of the memories that came back to her. She (wrote down dreams, fragments she saw in flashes. But she did not mention any of this in her letters to Maharet.\\n\\n She had a love affair while she was in London. It ended badly, and she felt rather alone. It was at that time that the Talamasca contacted her and the course of her life was changed forever.\\n\\n Jesse had been living in an old house in Chelsea, not far from where Oscar Wilde had once lived. James McNeill Whistler had once shared the neighborhood and so had Bram Stoker, the author of Dracula. It was a place that Jesse loved. But unbeknownst to her, the house in which she\u0027d leased her rooms had been haunted for many years. Jesse saw several strange things within the first few months. They were faint, flickering, apparitions of the kind one frequently sees in such places; echoes, as Maharet had called them, of people who\u0027d been there years before. Jesse ignored them.\\n\\n However when a reporter stopped her one afternoon, explaining that he was doing a story on the haunted house, she told him rather matter-of-factly about the things she\u0027d seen. Common enough ghosts for London-an old woman carrying a pitcher from the pantry, a man in a frock coat and top hat who would appear for a second or more on the stair.\\n\\n It made for a rather melodramatic article. Jesse had talked too much, obviously. She was called a \"psychic\" or \"natural medium\" who saw these things all the time. One of the Reeves family in Yorkshire called to tease her a little about it. Jesse thought it was funny too. But other than that, she didn\u0027t much care. She was deep into her studies at the British Museum. It just didn\u0027t matter at all.\\n\\n Then the Talamasca, having read the paper, came to call.\\n\\n Aaron Lightner, an old-fashioned gentleman with white hair and exquisite manners, asked to take Jesse to lunch. In an old but meticulously maintained Rolls Royce, he and Jesse were driven through London to a small and elegant private club.\\n\\n Surely it was one of the strangest meetings Jesse had ever had. In fact, it reminded her of the long ago summer, not because it was like it, but because both experiences were so unlike anything else that had ever happened to Jesse.\\n\\n Lightner was a bit on the glamorous side, as Jesse saw it. His white hair was quite full and neatly groomed, and he wore an impeccably tailored suit of Donegal tweed. He was the only man she\u0027d ever seen with a silver walking stick.\\n\\n Rapidly and pleasantly he explained to Jesse that he was a \"psychic detective\"; he worked for a \"secret order called the Talamasca,\" whose sole purpose was to collect data on \"paranormal\" experiences and maintain those records for the study of such phenomena. The Talamasca held out its hand to people with paranormal powers. And to those of extremely strong ability, it now and then offered membership, a career in \"psychic investigation,\" which was in fact more truly a vocation, as the Talamasca demanded full devotion, loyalty, and obedience to its rules.\\n\\n Jesse almost laughed. But Lightner was apparently prepared for her skepticism. He had a few \"tricks\" he always used at such introductory meetings. And to Jesse\u0027s utter amazement, he managed to move several objects on the table without touching them. A simple power, he said, which functioned as a \"calling card.\"\\n\\n As Jesse watched the salt shaker dance back and forth of its own volition, she was too amazed to speak. But the real surprise came when Lightner confessed he knew all about her. He knew where she\u0027d come from, where she\u0027d studied. He knew that she\u0027d seen spirits when she was a little girl, it had come to the attention of the order years ago through \"routine channels,\" and a file had been created for Jesse. She must not be offended.\\n\\n Please understand the Talamasca proceeded in its investigations with the utmost respect for the individual. The file contained only hearsay reports of things that Jesse had told neighbors, teachers, and school friends. Jesse could see the file any time she wanted. That was always the way it was with the Talamasca. Contact was always eventually attempted with subjects under observation. Information was freely given to the subject, though it was otherwise confidential.\\n\\n Jesse questioned Lightner rather relentlessly. It soon became clear that he did know a great deal about her, but he knew nothing whatsoever about Maharet or the Great Family.\\n\\n And it was this combination of knowledge and ignorance that lured Jesse. One mention of Maharet and she would have turned her back on the Talamasca forever, for to the Great Family Jesse was unfailingly loyal. But the Talamasca cared only about Jesse\u0027s abilities. And Jesse, in spite of Maharet\u0027s advice, had always cared about them, too.\\n\\n Then the history of the Talamasca itself proved powerfully attractive. Was this man telling the truth? A secret order, which traced its existence back to the year 758, an order with records of witches, sorcerers, mediums, and seers of spirits going back to that remote period? It dazzled her as the records of the Great Family had once dazzled her.\\n\\n And Lightner graciously withstood another round of relentless questioning. He knew his history and his geography, that was clear enough. He spoke easily and accurately of the persecution of the Cathars, the suppression of the Knights Templar, the execution of Grandier, and a dozen other historical \"events.\" In fact, Jesse couldn\u0027t stump him. On the contrary, he referred to ancient \"magicians\" and \"sorcerers\" of whom she had never heard.\\n\\n That evening, when they arrived at the Motherhouse outside London, Jesse\u0027s fate was pretty much sealed. She didn\u0027t leave the Motherhouse for a week, and then only to close up her fiat in Chelsea and return to the Talamasca.\\n\\n The Motherhouse was a mammoth stone structure built in the 1505 and acquired by the Talamasca \"only\" two hundred years ago. Though the sumptuous paneled libraries and parlors had been created in the eighteenth century, along with appropriate plasterwork and friezes, the dining room and many of the bedchambers dated back to the Elizabethan period.\\n\\n Jesse loved the atmosphere immediately, the dignified furnishings, the stone fireplaces, the gleaming oak floors. Even the quiet civil members of the order appealed to her, as they greeted her cheerfully, then returned to their discussions or the reading of the evening papers, as they sat about the vast, warmly lighted public rooms. The sheer wealth of the place was startling. It lent substance to Lightner\u0027s claims. And the place felt good. Psychically good. People here were what they said they were.\\n\\n But it was the libraries themselves that finally overwhelmed her, and brought her back to that tragic summer when another library and its ancient treasures had been shut against her. Here were countless volumes chronicling witch trials and hauntings and poltergeist investigations, cases of possession, of psychokinesis, reincarnation, and the like. Then there were museums beneath the building, rooms crammed with mysterious objects connected with paranormal occurrences. There were vaults to \u0027 which no one was admitted except the senior members of the order. Delicious, the prospect of secrets revealed only over a I period of time.\\n\\n \"So much work to be done, always,\" Aaron had said casually. \"Why, all these old records, you see, are in Latin, and we can no longer demand that the new members read and write Latin. It\u0027s simply out of the question in this day and age. And these storage rooms, you see, the documentation on most of these objects hasn\u0027t been reevaluated in four centuries-\"\\n\\n Of course Aaron knew that Jesse could read and write not only Latin, but Greek, ancient Egyptian, and ancient Sumerian as well. What he didn\u0027t know was that here Jesse had found a replacement for the treasures of that lost summer. She had found another \"Great Family.\"\\n\\n That night a car was sent to get Jesse\u0027s clothing and whatever she might want from the Chelsea flat. Her new room was in the southwest corner of the Motherhouse, a cozy little affair with a coffered ceiling and a Tudor fireplace.\\n\\n Jesse never wanted to leave this house, and Aaron knew it. On Friday of that week, only three days after her arrival, she was received into the order as a novice. She was given an impressive allowance, a private parlor adjacent to her bedroom, a full-time driver, and a comfortable old car. She left her job at the British Museum as soon as possible.\\n\\n The rules and regulations were simple. She would spend two years in full-time training, traveling with other members when and where necessary throughout the world. She could talk about the order to members of her family or friends, of course. But all subjects, files, and related details remained confidential. And she must never seek to publish anything about the Talamasca. In fact, she must never contribute to any \"public mention\" of the Talamasca. References to specific assignments must always omit names and places, and remain vague.\\n\\n Her special work would be within the archives, translating and \"adapting\" old chronicles and records. And in the museums she would work on organizing various artifacts and relics at least one day of each week. But fieldwork-investigations of hauntings and the like-would take precedence over research at any time.\\n\\n It was a month before she wrote to Maharet of her decision. And in her letter she poured out her soul. She loved these people and their work. Of course the library reminded her of the family archive in Sonoma, and the time when she\u0027d been so happy. Did Maharet understand?\\n\\n Maharet\u0027s answer astonished her. Maharet knew what the Talamasca was. In fact, Maharet seemed quite thoroughly familiar with the history of the Talamasca. She said without preamble that she admired enormously the efforts of the order during the witchcraft persecutions of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries to save the innocent from the stake.\\n\\n Surely they have told you of their \"underground railroad\" by means of which many accused persons were taken from the villages and hamlets where they might have been burnt and given refuge in Amsterdam, an enlightened city, where the lies and foolishness of the witchcraft era were not long believed.\\n\\n Jesse hadn\u0027t known anything about this, but she was soon to confirm every detail. However, Maharet had her reservations about the Talamasca.\\n\\n Much as I admire their compassion for the persecuted of all eras, you must understand that I do not think their investigations amount to much. To clarify spirits, ghosts, I vampires, werewolves, witches, entities that defy description all these may exist and the Talamasca may spend another millennium studying them, but what difference will this make to the destiny of the human race? I Undoubtedly there have been, in the distant past, individuals who saw visions and spoke to spirits. And perhaps as witches or shamans, these people had some value for their tribes or nations. But complex and fanciful religions have been founded upon such simple and deceptive experiences, giving mythical names to vague entities, and creating an enormous vehicle for compounded superstitious belief. Have not these religions been more evil than good?\\n\\n Allow me to suggest that, however one interprets history, we are now well past the point where contact with spirits can be of any use. A crude but inexorable justice may be at work in the skepticism of ordinary individuals regarding ghosts, mediums, and like company. The supernatural, in whatever form it exists, should not interfere in human history.\\n\\n In sum, I am arguing that, except for comforting a few confused souls here and there, the Talamasca compiles records of things that are not important and should not be important. The Talamasca is an interesting organization. But it cannot accomplish great things.\\n\\n I love you. I respect your decision. But I hope for your sake that you tire of the Talamasca-and return to the real world-very soon.\\n\\n Jesse thought carefully before answering. It tortured her that Maharet didn\u0027t approve of what she had done. Yet Jesse knew there was a recrimination in her decision. Maharet had turned her away from the secrets of the family; the Talamasca had taken her in.\\n\\n When she wrote, she assured Maharet that the members of the order had no illusions about the significance of their work. They had told Jesse it was largely secret; there was no glory, sometimes no real satisfaction. They would agree in full with Maharet\u0027s opinions about the insignificance of mediums, spirits, ghosts.\\n\\n But did not millions of people think that the dusty finds of archaeologists were of little significance as well? Jesse begged Maharet to understand what this meant to her. And lastly she wrote, much to her own surprise, the following lines:\\n\\n I will never tell the Talamasca anything about the Great Family. I will never tell them about the house in Sonoma and the mysterious things that happened to me while I was there. They would be too hungry for this sort of mystery. And my loyalty is to you. But some day, I beg you, let me come back to the California house. Let me talk to you about the things that I saw. I\u0027ve remembered things lately. I have had puzzling dreams. But I trust your judgment in these matters. You\u0027ve been so generous to me. I don\u0027t doubt that you love me. Please understand how much I love you.\\n\\n Maharet\u0027s response was brief. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-queen-of-the-damned-the-vampire-chronicles-3/page-15.html","bookId":2211,"book":{"id":2211,"title":"The Queen Of The Damned (The Vampire Chronicles #3)","description":"Storyline: The Queen of the Damned (The Vampire Chronicles #3) \\n The Queen of the Damned is the third novel of Anne Rice\u0027s The Vampire Chronicles series.
