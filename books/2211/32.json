{"id":102391,"no":32,"title":"Page 32","content":"\"For before we could leave the shepherd people, soldiers came again, under the command of the King\u0027s high steward, Khayman, soldiers who had passed out gold along the way to any tribe who had seen or heard of the red-haired twins and knew where they might be.\\n\\n \"Once again at midday as the sun poured down on the grassy fields, we saw the Egyptian soldiers with their swords raised. In all directions the people scattered, but Mekare ran out and dropped down on her knees before Khayman and said, \u0027Don\u0027t harm our people again.\u0027\\n\\n \"Then Khayman came with Mekare to the place where I was hiding with my daughter, and I showed him this child, which was his child, and begged him for mercy, for justice, that he leave us in peace.\\n\\n \"But I had only to look at him to understand that he would be put to death if he did not bring us back. His face was thin and drawn and full of misery, not the smooth white immortal face that you see here at this table tonight.\\n\\n \"Enemy time has washed away the natural imprint of his suffering. But it was very plain on that long ago afternoon.\\n\\n \"In a soft, subdued voice he spoke to us. \u0027A terrible evil has come over the King and the Queen of Kemet,\u0027 he said. \u0027And your spirits have done it, your spirits that tormented me night and day for what I did to you, until the King sought to drive them out of my house.\u0027\\n\\n \"He stretched out his arms to me that I could see the tiny scars that covered him where this spirit had drawn blood. Scars covered his face and his throat.\\n\\n \" \u0027Oh, you don\u0027t know the misery in which I have lived,\u0027 he said, \"for nothing could protect me from these spirits; and you don\u0027t know the times I cursed you, and cursed the King for what he made me do to you, and cursed my mother that I\u0027d been born.\u0027\\n\\n \" \u0027Oh, but we have not done this!\u0027 Mekare said. \"We have kept faith with you. For our lives we left you in peace. But it is Amel, the evil one, who has done this! Oh, this evil spirit! And to think he has deviled you instead of the King and Queen who made you do what you did! We cannot stop him! I beg you, Khayman, let us go.\u0027\\n\\n \" \u0027Whatever Amel does,\" I said, \u0027he will tire of, Khayman. If the King and Queen are strong, he will eventually go away. You are looking now upon the mother of your child, Khayman. Leave us in peace. For the child\u0027s sake, tell the King and Queen that you could not find us. Let us go if you fear justice at all.\u0027\\n\\n \"But he only stared at the child as if he did not know what it was. He was Egyptian. Was this child Egyptian? He looked at us:\\n\\n \u0027All right, you did not send this spirit,\u0027 he said. \u0027I believe you. For you do not understand what this spirit has done, obviously. His bedeviling has come to an end. He has gone into the King and Queen of Kemet! He is in their bodies! He has changed the very substance of their flesh!\u0027\\n\\n \"For a long time, we looked at him and considered his words, and we understood that he did not mean by this that the King and the Queen were possessed. And we understood also that he himself had seen such things that he could not but*come for us himself and try on his life to bring us back.\\n\\n \"But I didn\u0027t believe what he was saying. How could a spirit be made flesh!\\n\\n \" \u0027You do not understand what has happened in our kingdom,\u0027 he whispered. \u0027You must come and see with your own eyes.\u0027 He stopped then because there was more, much more, that he wanted to tell us, and he was afraid. Bitterly he said, \u0027You must undo what has been done, even if it is not your doing!\u0027\\n\\n \"Ah, but we could not undo it. That was the horror. And even then we knew it; we sensed it. We remembered our mother standing before the cave gazing at the tiny wounds on her hand.\\n\\n \"Mekare threw back her head now and called to Amel, the evil one, to come to her, to obey her command. In our own tongue, the twin tongue, she screamed, \"Come out of the King and Queen of Kemet and come to me, Amel. Bow down before my will. You did this not by my command.\u0027\\n\\n \"It seemed all the spirits of the world listened in silence; this was the cry of a powerful witch; but there was no answer; and then we felt it-a great recoiling of many spirits as if something beyond their knowledge and beyond their acceptance had suddenly been revealed. It seemed the spirits were shrinking from us; and then coming back, sad and undecided; seeking our love, yet repelled.\\n\\n \" \u0027But what is it?\u0027 Mekare screamed. \u0027What is it!\u0027 She called to the spirits who hovered near her, her chosen ones. And then in the stillness, as the shepherds waited in fear, and the soldiers stood in anticipation, and Khayman stared at us with tired glazed eyes, we heard the answer. It came in wonder and uncertainty.\\n\\n \" \u0027Amel has now what he has always wanted; Amel has the flesh. But Amel is no more.\u0027\\n\\n \"What could it mean?\\n\\n \"We could not fathom it. Again, Mekare demanded of the spirits that they answer, but it seemed that the uncertainty of the spirits was now turning to fear.\\n\\n \" \u0027Tell me what has happened!\u0027 Mekare said. \u0027Make known to me what you know!\u0027 It was an old command used by countless witches. \u0027Give me the knowledge which is yours to give.\u0027\\n\\n \"And again the spirits answered in uncertainty:\\n\\n \" \u0027 Amel is in the flesh; and Amel is not Amel; he cannot answer now.\u0027\\n\\n \" \u0027You must come with me,\u0027 Khayman said. \u0027You must come. The King and Queen would have you come!\"\\n\\n \"Mutely, and seemingly without feeling, he watched as I kissed my baby girl and gave her to the shepherd women who would care for her as their own. And then Mekare and I gave ourselves up to him; but this time we did not weep. It was as if all our tears had been shed. Our brief year of happiness with the birth of Miriam was past now-and the horror that had come out of Egypt was reaching out to engulf us once more.\\n\\n Maharet closed her eyes for a moment; she touched the lids with her fingers, and then looked up at the others, as they waited, each in his or he? own thoughts and considerations, each reluctant for the narrative to be broken, though they all knew that it must.\\n\\n The young ones were drawn and weary; Daniel\u0027s rapt expression had changed little. Louis was gaunt, and the need for blood was hurting him, though he paid it no mind. \"I can tell you no more now,\" Maharet said. \"It\u0027s almost morning; and the young ones must go down to the earth. I have to prepare the way for them.\\n\\n \"Tomorrow night we will gather here and continue. That is, if our Queen will allow. The Queen is nowhere near us now; I cannot hear the faintest murmur of her presence; I cannot catch the faintest flash of her countenance in another\u0027s eyes. If she knows what we do, she allows it. Or she is far away and indifferent, and we must wait to know her will.\\n\\n \"Tomorrow, I\u0027ll tell you what we saw when we went into Kernel.\"\\n\\n \"Until then, rest safe within the mountain. All of you. It has kept my secrets from the prying eyes of mortal men for countless years. Remember not even the Queen can hurt us until nightfall.\"\\n\\n Marius rose as Maharet did. He moved to the far window as the others slowly left the room. It was as if Maharet\u0027s voice were still speaking to him. And what affected him most deeply was the evocation of Akasha, and the hatred Maharet felt for her; because Marius felt that hatred too; and he felt more strongly than ever that he should have brought this nightmare to a close while he\u0027d had the power to do it.\\n\\n But the red-haired woman could not have wanted any Such thing to happen. None of them wanted to die any more than he did. And Maharet craved life, perhaps, more fiercely than any immortal he\u0027d ever known.\\n\\n Yet her tale seemed to confirm the hopelessness of it all. What had risen when the Queen stood up from her throne? What was this being that had Lestat in its maw? He could not imagine.\\n\\n We change, but we do not change, he thought. We grow wise, but we are fallible things! We are only human for however long we endure, that was the miracle and the curse of it.\\n\\n He saw again the smiling face he had seen as the ice began to fall. Is it possible that he loved as strongly still as he hated? That in his great humiliation, clarity had escaped him utterly? He honestly didn\u0027t know.\\n\\n And he was tired suddenly, craving sleep, craving comfort; craving the soft sensuous pleasure of lying in a clean bed. Of sprawling upon it and burying his face in a pillow; of letting his limbs assemble themselves in the most natural and comfortable position.\\n\\n Beyond the glass wall, a soft radiant blue light was filling the eastern sky, yet the stars retained their brilliance, tiny and distant though they seemed. The dark trunks of the redwoods had become visible; and a lovely green smell had come into the house from the forest as always happens near dawn.\\n\\n Far below where the hillside fell away and a clearing full of clover moved out to the woods, Marius saw Khayman walking alone. His hands appeared to glow in the thin, bluish darkness, and as he turned and looked back-up at Marius-his face was an eyeless mask of pure white.\\n\\n Marius found himself raising his hand in a small gesture of friendship towards Khayman. And Khayman returned the gesture and went on into the trees.\\n\\n Then Marius turned and saw what he already knew, that only Louis remained with him in the room. Louis stood quite still looking at him as he had earlier, as though he were seeing a myth made real.\\n\\n Then he put the question that was obsessing him, the question he could not lose sight of, no matter how great was Maharet\u0027s spell. \"You know whether or not Lestat\u0027s still alive, don\u0027t you?\" he asked. \u0027It had a simple human tone to it, a poignant tone, yet the voice was so reserved.\\n\\n Marius nodded. \"He\u0027s alive. But I don\u0027t really know that the way you think I do. Not from asking or receiving the answer. Not from using all these lovely powers which plague us. I know it simply because I know.\"\\n\\n He smiled at Louis. Something in the manner of this one made Marius happy, though he wasn\u0027t sure why. He beckoned for Louis to come to him and they met at the foot of the table and walked together out of the room. Marius put his arm around Louis\u0027s shoulder and they went down the iron stairs together, through the damp earth, Marius walking slowly and heavily, exactly like a human being might walk.\\n\\n \"And you\u0027re sure of it?\" Louis asked respectfully.\\n\\n Marius stopped. \"Oh, yes, quite sure.\" They looked at one another for a moment, and again Marius smiled. This one was so gifted yet not gifted at the same time; he wondered if the human light would go out of Louis\u0027s eyes if he ever gained more power, if he ever had, for instance, a little of the blood of Marius in his veins.\\n\\n And this young one was hungry too; he was suffering; and he seemed to like it, to like the hunger and the pain.\\n\\n \"Let me tell you something,\" Marius said now, agreeably. \"1 knew the first moment I ever laid eyes on Lestat that nothing could kill him. That\u0027s the way it is with some of us. We can\u0027t die.\" But why was he saying this? Did he believe it again as he had before these trials had begun? He thought back to that night in San Francisco when he had walked down the broad clean-swept pavements of Market Street with his hands in his pockets, unnoticed by mortal men.\\n\\n \"Forgive me,\" Louis said, \"but you remind me of the things they said of him at Dracula\u0027s Daughter, the talk among the ones who wanted to join him last night.\"\\n\\n \"I know,\" Marius said. \"But they are fools and I\u0027m right.\" He laughed softly. Yes, he did believe it. Then he embraced Louis again warmly. Just a little blood, and Louis might be stronger, true, but then he might lose the human tenderness, the human wisdom that no one could give another; the gift of knowing others\u0027 suffering with which Louis had probably been born.\\n\\n But the night was over now for this one. Louis took Marius\u0027s hand, and then turned and walked down the tin-walled corridor to where Eric waited to show him the way.\\n\\n Then Marius went up into the house.\\n\\n He had perhaps a full hour more before the sun forced him into sleep, and tired as he was, he would not give it up. The lovely fresh smell of the woods was overpowering. And he could hear the birds now, and the clear singing of a deep creek.\\n\\n He went into the great room of the adobe dwelling, where the fire had burnt down on the central hearth. He found himself standing before a giant quilt that covered almost half the wall.\\n\\n Slowly he realized what he was seeing before him-the mountain, the valley, and the tiny figures of the twins as they stood together in the green clearing beneath the burning sun. The slow rhythm of Maharet\u0027s speech came back to him with the faint shimmer of all the images her words had conveyed. So immediate was that sun-drenched clearing, and how different it seemed now from the dreams. Never had the dreams made him feel close to these women! And now he knew them; he knew this house.\\n\\n It was such a mystery, this mixture of feeling, where sorrow touched something that was undeniably positive and good. Maharet\u0027s soul attracted him; he loved the particular complexity of it, and he wished he could somehow tell her so.\\n\\n Then it was as if he caught himself; he realized that he had forgotten for a little while to be bitter, to be in pain. Maybe his soul was healing faster than he had ever supposed it could.\\n\\n Or maybe it was only that he had been thinking about others- about Maharet, and before that about Louis, and what Louis needed to believe. Well, hell, Lestat probably was immortal. In fact, the sharp and bitter fact occurred to him that Lestat might survive all this even if he, Marius, did not.\\n\\n But that was a little supposition that he could do without. Where was Armand? Had Armand gone down into the earth already? If only he could see Armand just now. . . .\\n\\n He went towards the cellar door again but something distracted him. Through an open doorway he saw two figures, very like the figures of the twins on the quilt. But these were Maharet and Jesse, arm in arm before an eastern window, watching motionless as the light grew brighter in the dark woods.\\n\\n A violent shudder startled him. He had to grip the door frame to steady himself as a series of images flooded his mind. Not the jungle now; there was a highway in the distance, winding north, it seemed, through barren burnt land. And the creature had stopped, shaken, but by what? An image of two red-haired women? He heard the feet begin their relentless tramp again; he saw the feet caked with earth as if they were his feet; the hands caked with earth as if they were his hands. And then he saw the sky catching fire, and he moaned aloud.\\n\\n When he looked up again, Armand was holding him. And with her bleary human eyes Maharet was imploring him to tell her what he had just seen. Slowly the room came alive around him, the agreeable furnishings, and then the immortal figures near him, who were of it, yet of nothing. He closed his eyes and opened them again.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s reached our longitude,\" he said, \"yet she\u0027s miles to the east. The sun\u0027s just risen there with blazing force.\" He had felt it, that lethal heat! But she had gone into the earth; that too he had felt.\\n\\n \"But it\u0027s very far south of here,\" Jesse said to him. How frail she looked in the translucent darkness, her long thin fingers hugging the backs of her slender arms.\\n\\n \"Not so far,\" Armand said. \"And she was moving very fast.\" \"But in what direction does she move!\" Maharet asked. \"Is she coming towards us?\"\\n\\n She didn\u0027t wait for an answer. And it didn\u0027t seem that they could give it. She lifted her hand to cover her eyes as if the pain there was now intolerable; and then gathering Jesse to her, and kissing her suddenly, she bid the others good sleep.\\n\\n Marius closed his eyes; he tried to see again the figure he had seen before. The garment, what was it? A rough thing thrown over the body like a peasant poncho, with a torn opening for the head. Bound at the waist, yes, he\u0027d felt it. He tried to see more but he could not. What he had felt was power, illimitable power and unstoppable momentum, and almost nothing other than that. When he opened his eyes again the morning shimmered in the room around him. Armand stood close to him, embracing him still, yet Armand seemed alone and perturbed by nothing; his eyes moved only a little as he looked at the forest, which now seemed to press against the house through every window, as if it had crept to the very edge of the porch.\\n\\n Marius kissed Armand\u0027s forehead. And then he did exactly what Armand was doing.\\n\\n He watched the room grow lighter; he watched the light fill the windowpanes; he watched the beautiful colors brighten in the vast network of the giant quilt.\\n\\n LESTAT:\\n\\n THIS IS MY BODY;\\n\\n THIS IS MY BLOOD\\n\\n WHEN I AWOKE IT WAS QUIET, AND THE AIR WAS clean and warm, with the smell of the sea.\\n\\n I was now thoroughly confused as to time. And I knew from my light-headedness that I had not slept through a day. Also I wasn\u0027t in any protective enclosure.\\n\\n We\u0027d been following the night around the world, perhaps, or rather moving at random in it, as Akasha maybe didn\u0027t need at all to sleep.\\n\\n I needed it, that was obvious. But I was too curious not to want to be awake. And frankly too miserable. Also I\u0027d been dreaming of human blood.\\n\\n I found myself in a spacious bedroom with terraces to the west and to the north. I could smell the sea and I could hear it, yet the air was fragrant and rather still. Very gradually, I took stock of the room.\\n\\n Lavish old furnishings, most likely Italian-delicate yet ornamented-were mingled with modern luxuries everywhere I looked. The bed on which I lay was a gilded four-poster, hung with gauzy curtains, and covered with down pillows and draperies of silk. A thick white carpet concealed the old floor.\\n\\n There was a dressing table littered with glittering jars and silver objects, and a curious old-fashioned white telephone. Velvet chairs; a monster of a television set and shelves of stereo music equipment; and small polished tables everywhere, strewn with newspapers, ashtrays, decanters of wine.\\n\\n People had lived here up till an hour ago; but now the people were dead. In fact, there were many dead on this island. And as I lay there for a moment, drinking in the beauty around me, I saw the village in my mind where we had been before. I saw the filth, the tin roofs, the mud. And now I lay in this bower, or so it seemed.\\n\\n And there was death here too. We had brought it.\\n\\n I got up off the bed and went out onto the terrace and looked down over the stone railing at a white beach. No land on the horizon, only the gently rolling sea. The lacy foam of the receding waves glistening under the moon. And I was in an old weathered palazzo, probably built some four centuries ago, decked with urns and cherubs and covered with stained plaster, a rather beautiful place. Electric lights shone through the green-painted shutters of other rooms. Nestled on a lower terrace just beneath me was a little swimming pool.\\n\\n And ahead where the beach curved to the left, I saw another old graceful dwelling nestled into the cliffs. People had died in there too. This was a Greek island, I was sure of it; this was the Mediterranean Sea.\\n\\n When I listened, I heard cries coming from the land behind me, over the crest of the hill. Men being slain. I leaned against the frame of the door. I tried to stop my heart from racing.\\n\\n Some sudden memory of the slaughter in Azim\u0027s temple gripped me-a flash of myself walking through the human herd, using the invisible blade to pierce solid flesh. Thirst. Or was it merely lust? I saw those mangled limbs again; wasted bodies contorted in the final struggle, faces smeared with blood.\\n\\n Not my doing, I couldn\u0027t have . . . But I had.\\n\\n And now I could smell fires burning, fires like those fires in Azim\u0027s courtyard where the bodies were being burnt. The smell nauseated me. I turned towards the sea again and took a deep clean breath. If I let them, the voices would come, voices from all over the island, and from other islands, and from the nearby land, too. I could feel it, the sound, hovering there waiting; I had to push it back.\\n\\n Then I heard more immediate noise. Women in this old mansion. They were approaching the bedchamber. I turned around just in time to see the double doors opened, and the women, dressed in simple blouses and skirts and kerchiefs, come into the room.\\n\\n It was a motley crowd of all ages, including young beauties and stout older matrons, and even some rather frail creatures with darkly wrinkled skin and snow white hair. They brought vases of flowers with them; they were placing them everywhere. And then one of the women, a tentative slender thing with a beautiful long neck, moved forward with beguiling natural grace, and began to turn on the many lamps.\\n\\n Smell of their blood. How could it be so strong and so enticing, when I felt no thirst?\\n\\n Suddenly they all came together in the center of the room and they stared at me; it was as if they\u0027d fallen into a trance. I was standing on the terrace, merely looking at them; then I realized what they saw. My torn costume-the vampire rags-black coat, white shirt, and the cloak-all spattered with blood.\\n\\n And my skin, that had changed measurably. I was whiter, more ghastly to look at, of course. And my eyes must have been brighter; or maybe I was being deceived by their naive reactions. When had they seen one of us before?\\n\\n Whatever ... it all seemed to be some sort of dream, these still women with their black eyes and their rather somber faces-even the stout ones had rather gaunt faces-gathered there staring at me, and then their dropping one by one to their knees. Ah, to their knees. I sighed. They had the crazed expression of people who had been delivered out of the ordinary; they were seeing a vision and the irony was that they looked like a vision to me.\\n\\n Reluctantly, I read their thoughts.\\n\\n They had seen the Blessed Mother. That is what she was here. The Madonna, the Virgin. She\u0027d come to their villages and told them to slaughter their sons and husbands; even the babies had been slaughtered. And they had done it, or witnessed the doing of it; and they were now carried upon a wave of belief and joy. They were witnesses to miracles; they had been spoken to by the Blessed Mother herself. And she was the ancient Mother, the Mother who had always dwelt in the grottoes of this island, even before Christ, the Mother whose tiny naked statues were now and then found in the earth.\\n\\n In her name they had knocked down the columns of the ruined temples, the ones the tourists came here to see; they had burned the only church on the island; they had knocked out its windows with sticks and stones. Ancient murals had burned in the church. The marble columns, broken into fragments, had fallen into the sea.\\n\\n As for me, what was I to them? Not merely a god. Not merely the chosen of the Blessed Mother. No, something else. It puzzled me as I stood there, trapped by their eyes, repelled by their convictions, yet fascinated and afraid.\\n\\n Not of them, of course, but of everything that was happening. Of this delicious feeling of mortals looking at me, the way they had been looking when I\u0027d been on the stage. Mortals looking at me and sensing my power after all the years of hiding, mortals come here to worship. Mortals like all those poor creatures strewn over the path in the mountains. But they\u0027d been worshipers of Azim, hadn\u0027t they? They\u0027d gone there to die.\\n\\n Nightmare. Have to reverse this, have to stop it; have to stop myself from accepting it or any aspect of it!\\n\\n I mean I could start believing that I was really- But I know what I am, don\u0027t I? And these are poor, ignorant women; women for whom television sets and phones are miracles, these are women for whom change itself is a form of miracle.... And they will wake up tomorrow and they will see what they have done! But now the feeling of peace came over us-the women and me. The familiar scent of flowers, the spell. Silently, through their minds, the women were receiving their instructions.\\n\\n There was a little commotion; two of them rose from their knees and entered an adjoining bath-one of those massive marble affairs that wealthy Italians and Greeks seem to love. Hot water was flowing; steam poured out of the open doors.\\n\\n Other women had gone to the closets, to take out clean garments. Rich, whoever he was, the poor bastard who had owned this little palace, the poor bastard who had left that cigarette in the ashtray and the faint greasy fingerprints on the white phone. Another pair of women came towards me. They wanted to lead me into the bath. I did nothing. I felt them touch me-hot human fingers touching me and all the attendant shock and excitement in them as they felt the peculiar texture of my flesh. It sent a powerful and delicious chill through me, these touches. Their dark liquid eyes were beautiful as they looked at me. They tugged at me with their warm hands; they wanted me to come with them. All right. I allowed myself to be taken along. White marble tile, carved gold fixtures; an ancient Roman splendor, when you got right down to it, with gleaming bottles of soaps and scents lining marble shelves. And the Rood of hot water in the pool, with the jets pumping it full of bubbles, it was all very inviting; or might have been at some other time.\\n\\n They stripped my garments off me. Absolutely fascinating feeling. No one had ever done such a thing to me. Not since I\u0027d been alive and then only when I was a very small child. I stood in the flood of steam from the bath, watching all these small dark hands, and feeling the hairs rise all over my body; feeling the adoration in the women\u0027s eyes. Through the steam I looked into the mirror-a wall of mirror actually, and I saw myself for the first time since this sinister odyssey had begun. The shock was more for a moment than I could handle. This can\u0027t be me.\\n\\n I was much paler than I\u0027d imagined. Gently I pushed the women away and went towards the mirror wall. My skin had a pearlescent gleam to it; and my eyes were even brighter, gathering all the colors of the spectrum and mingling them with an icy light. Yet I didn\u0027t look like Marius. I didn\u0027t look like Akasha. The lines in my face were still there!\\n\\n In other words I\u0027d been bleached by Akasha\u0027s blood, but I hadn\u0027t become smooth yet. I\u0027d kept my human expression. And the odd thing was, the contrast now made these lines all the more visible. Even the tiny lines all over my fingers were more clearly etched than before.\\n\\n But what consolation was this when I was more than ever .noticeable, astonishing, unlike a human being? In a way, this was worse than that first moment two hundred years ago, when an hour or so after my death I\u0027d seen myself in a mirror, and tried to find my humanity in what I was seeing. I was just as afraid right now.\\n\\n I studied my reflection-my chest was like a marble torso in a museum, that white. And the organ, the organ we don\u0027t need, poised as if ready for what it would never again know how to do or want to do, marble, a Priapus at a gate.\\n\\n Dazed, I watched the women draw closer; lovely throats, breasts, dark moist limbs. I watched them touch me all over again. I was beautiful to them, all right.\\n\\n The scent of their blood was stronger in here, in the rising steam. Yet I wasn\u0027t thirsty, not really. Akasha had filled me, but the blood was tormenting me a little. No, quite a lot.\\n\\n I wanted their blood-and it had nothing to do with thirst. I wanted it the way a man can want vintage wine, though he\u0027s drunk water. Only magnify that by twenty or thirty or a hundred. In fact, it was so powerful I could imagine taking all of them, tearing at their tender throats one after another and leaving their bodies lying here on the floor.\\n\\n No, this is not going to take place, I reasoned. And the sharp, dangerous quality of this lust made me want to weep. What\u0027s been done to me! But then I knew, didn\u0027t I? I knew I was so strong now that twenty men couldn\u0027t have subdued me. And think what I could do to them. I could rise up through the ceiling if I wanted to and get free of here. I could do things of which I\u0027d never dreamed. Probably I had the fire gift now; I could burn things the way she could burn them, the way Marius said that he could. Just a matter of strength, that\u0027s all it was. And dizzying levels of awareness, of acceptance. . . .\\n\\n The women were kissing me. They were kissing my shoulders. Just a lovely little sensation, the soft pressure of the lips on my skin. I couldn\u0027t help smiling, and gently I embraced them and kissed them, nuzzling their heated little necks and feeling their breasts against my chest. I was utterly surrounded by these malleable creatures, I was blanketed in succulent human flesh.\\n\\n I stepped into the deep tub and allowed them to wash me. The hot water splashed over me deliciously, washing away easily all the din that never really clings to us, never penetrates us. I looked up at the ceiling and let them brush the hot water through my hair.\\n\\n Yes, extraordinarily pleasurable, all of it. Yet never had I been so alone. I was sinking into these mesmerizing sensations; I was drifting. Because really, there was nothing else that I could do. When they were finished I chose the perfumes that I wanted and told them to get rid of the others. I spoke in French but they seemed to understand- Then they dressed me with the clothes I selected from what they presented to me, The master of this house had liked handmade linen shirts, which were only a little too large for me. And he\u0027d liked handmade shoes as well, and they were a tolerable fit.\\n\\n 1 chose a suit of gray silk, very fine weave, and rather jaunty modern cut. And silver jewelry. The man\u0027s silver watch, and his cuff links which had tiny diamonds embedded in them. And even a tiny diamond pin for the narrow lapel of the coat. But all these clothes felt so strange on me; it was as if I could feel the surface of my own skin yet not feel it. And there came that deja vu. Two hundred years ago. The old mortal questions. Why in the hell is this happening? How can I gain control of it?\\n\\n I wondered for a moment, was it possible not to care what happened? To stand back from it and view them all as alien creatures, things upon which I fed? Cruelly I\u0027d been ripped out of their world! Where was the old bitterness, the old excuse for endless cruelty? Why had it always focused itself upon such small things? Not that a life is small. Oh, no, never, not any life! That was the whole point actually. Why did I who could kill with such abandon shrink from the prospect of seeing their precious traditions laid waste?\\n\\n Why did my heart come up in my throat now? Why was I crying inside, like something dying myself? \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-queen-of-the-damned-the-vampire-chronicles-3/page-32.html","bookId":2211,"book":{"id":2211,"title":"The Queen Of The Damned (The Vampire Chronicles #3)","description":"Storyline: The Queen of the Damned (The Vampire Chronicles #3) \\n The Queen of the Damned is the third novel of Anne Rice\u0027s The Vampire Chronicles series.
