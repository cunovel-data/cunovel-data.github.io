{"id":64222,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"IN all the circumstances it would have been reasonable to expect that Weston would be much more taken aback at Ransom\u0027s presence than Ransom could be at his. But if he were, he showed no sign of it, and Ransom could hardly help admiring the massive egoism which enabled this man in the very moment of his arrival on an unknown world to stand there unmoved in all his authoritative vulgarity, his arms akimbo, his face scowling, and his feet planted as solidly on that unearthly soil as if he had been standing with his back to the fire in his own study. Then, with a shock, he noticed that Weston was speaking to the Lady in the Old Solar language with perfect fluency. On Malacandra, partly from incapacity, and much more from his contempt for the inhabitants, he had never acquired more than a smattering of it. Here was an inexplicable and disquieting novelty. Ransom felt that his only advantage had been taken from him. He felt that he was now in the presence of the incalculable. If the scales had been suddenly weighted in this one respect, what might come next? He awoke from his abstraction to find that Weston anti the Lady had been conversing fluently, but without mutual understanding. \"It is no use,\" she was saying. \"You anti I are not old enough to speak together, it seems. The sea in rising; let us go back to the islands. Will he come with us, Piebald?\" \"Where are the two fishes?\" said Ransom. \"They will be waiting in the next bay,\" said the Lady. \"Quick, then,\" said Ransom to her; and then, in answer t( her look: \"No, he will not come.\" She did not, presumably understand his urgency, but her eye was on the sea and he understood her own reason for haste. She had already begin to ascend the side of the valley, with - Ransom following her when Weston shouted, \"No, you don\u0027t.\" Ransom turned any found himself covered by a revolver. The sudden heat whirl swept over his body was the only sign by which he knew that he was frightened. His head remained clear. \"Are you going to begin in this world also by murdering one of its inhabitants?\" he asked. \"What are you saying?\" asked the Lady, pausing and looking back at the two men with a puzzled, tranquil face. \"Stay where you are, Ransom,\" said the Professor. \"That native can go where she likes; the sooner the better.\" Ransom was about to implore her to make good her escape when he realised that no imploring was needed. He had irrationally supposed that she would understand the situation; but apparently she saw nothing more than two strangers talking about something which she did not at the moment understand - What, and her own necessity of leaving the Fixed Land at once. \"You and he do not come with me, Piebald?\" she asked. \"No,\" said Ransom, without turning round. \"It may be that you and I shall not meet soon again. Greet the King for me if you find him and speak of me always to Maleldil. I stay here.\" \"We shall meet when Maleldil pleases,\" she answered, \"or if not, some greater good will happen to us instead.\" Then he heard her footsteps behind him for a few seconds, and then he heard them no more and knew he was alone with Weston. \"You allowed yourself to use the word Murder just now, Dr Ransom,\" said the Professor, \"in reference to an accident that\u0027 occurred when we were in Malacandra. In any case, the creature killed was not a human being. Allow me to tell you that I consider the seduction of a native girl as an almost equally unfortunate way of introducing civilisation to a new planet.\" \"Seduction?\" said Ransom. \"Oh, I see. You thought I was making love to her.\" \"When I find a naked civilised man embracing a naked savage woman in a solitary place, that is the name I give to it\" \"I wasn\u0027t embracing her,\" said Ransom dully, for the whole business of defending himself on this score seemed at that moment a mere weariness of the spirit. \"And no one wears clothes here. But what does it matter? Get on with the job that brings you to Perelandra.\" \"You ask me to believe that you have been living here with that woman under these conditions in a state of sexless innocence?\" \"Oh, sexless !\" said Ransom disgustedly. \"All right, if you like. It\u0027s about as good a description of living in Perelandra as it would be to say that a man had forgotten water because Niagara Falls didn\u0027t immediately give him the idea of making it into cups of tea. But you\u0027re right enough if you mean that I have had no more thought of desiring her than - than .. Comparisons failed him and his voice died. Then he began again: \"But don\u0027t say I\u0027m asking you to believe it, or to believe anything. I am asking you nothing but to begin and end as soon as possible whatever butcheries and robberies you have come to do.\" Weston eyed him for a moment with a curious expression then, unexpectedly, he returned his revolver to its holster. \"Ransom,\" he said, \"you do me a great injustice.\" For several seconds there was silence between them. Long breakers with white woolpacks of foam on them were now rolling into the cove exactly as on Earth. \"Yes,\" said Weston at last, \"and I will begin with a frank admission. You may make what capital of it you please. I shall not be deterred. I deliberately say that I was, in some respects, mistaken - seriously mistaken - in my conception of the whole interplanetary problem when I went to Malacandra.\" Partly from the relaxation which followed the disappearance of the pistol, and partly from the elaborate air of magnanimity with which the great scientist spoke, Ransom felt very much inclined to laugh. But it occurred to him that this was possibly the first occasion in his whole life in which Weston had ever acknowledged himself in the wrong, and that even the false dawn of humility, which is still ninety-nine per cent of arrogance, ought not to be rebuffed - or not by him. \"Well, that\u0027s very handsome,\" he said. \"How do you mean?\" \"I\u0027ll tell you presently,\" said Weston. \"In the meantime I must get my things ashore.\" Between them they beached the punt, and began carrying Weston\u0027s primus-stove and tins and tent and other packages to a spot about two hundred yards inland. Ransom, who knew all the paraphernalia to be needless, made no objection, and in about a quarter of an hour something like an encampment had been established in a mossy place under some blue-trunked silver-leaved trees beside a rivulet. Both men sat down and Ransom listened at first with interest, then with amazement, and finally with incredulity. Weston cleared his throat, threw out his chest, and assumed his lecturing manner. Throughout the conversation that followed, Ransom was filled with a sense of crazy irrelevance. Here were two human beings, thrown together in an alien world under conditions of inconceivable strangeness; the one separated from his space-ship, the other newly released from the threat of instant death. Was it sane - was it imaginable - that they should find themselves at once engaged in a philosophical argument which might just as well have occurred in a Cambridge combination room? Yet that, apparently, was what Weston insisted upon. He showed no interest in the fate of his space-ship; he even seemed to feel no curiosity about Ransom\u0027s presence on Venus. Could it be that he had travelled more than thirty million miles of space in search of conversation? But as he went on talking, Ransom felt himself more and more in the presence of a monomaniac. Like an actor who cannot think of anything but his celebrity, or a lover who can think of nothing but his mistress, tense, tedious, and unescapable, the scientist pursued his fixed idea. \"The tragedy of my life,\" he said, \"and indeed of the modern intellectual world in general, is the rigid specialisation of knowledge entailed by the growing complexity of what is known. It is my own share in that tragedy that an early devotion to physics has prevented me from paying any proper attention to Biology until I reached the fifties. To do myself justice, I should make it clear that the false humanist ideal of knowledge as an end in itself never appealed to me. I always wanted to know in order to achieve utility. At first, that utility naturally appeared to me in a personal form - I wanted scholarships, an income, and that generally recognised position in the world without which a man has no leverage. When those were attained, I began to look farther: to the utility of the human race!\" He paused as he rounded his period and Ransom nodded to him to proceed. \"The utility of the human race,\" continued Weston, \"in the long run depends rigidly on the possibility of interplanetary, and even inter-sidereal, travel. That problem I solved. The key of human destiny was placed in my hands. It would be unnecessary - and painful to us both - to remind you how it was wrenched from me in Malacandra by a member of a hostile intelligent species whose existence, I admit, I had not anticipated.\" \"Not hostile exactly,\" said Ransom, \"but go on.\" \"The rigours of our return journey from Malacandra led to a serious breakdown in my health - \" \"Mine too,\" said Ransom. Weston looked somewhat taken aback at the interruption and went on. \"During my convalescence I had that leisure for reflection which I had denied myself for many years. In particular I reflected on the objections you had felt to that liquidation of the non-human inhabitants of Malacandra which was, of course, the necessary preliminary to its occupation by our own species. The traditional and, if I may say so, the humanitarian form in which you advanced those objections had till then concealed from me their true strength. That strength I now began to perceive. I began to see that my own exclusive devotion to human utility was really based on an unconscious dualism.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"I mean that all my life I had been making a wholly unscientific dichotomy or antithesis between Man and Nature - had conceived myself fighting for Man against his non-human environment. During my illness I plunged into Biology, and particularly into what may be called biological philosophy. Hitherto, as a physicist, I had been content to regard Life as a subject outside my scope. The conflicting views of those who drew a sharp line between the organic and the inorganic and those who held that what we call Life was inherent in matter from the very beginning had not interested me. Now it did. I saw almost at once that I could admit no break, no discontinuity, in the unfolding of the cosmic process. I became a convinced believer in emergent evolution. All is one. The stuff of mind, the unconsciously purposive dynamism, is present from the very beginning.\" Here he paused. Ransom had heard this sort of thing pretty often. before and wondered when his companion was coming to the point. When Weston resumed it was with. an even deeper solemnity of tone. \"The majestic spectacle of this blind, inarticulate purposiveness thrusting its way upward and ever upward in an endless unity of differentiated achievements towards an ever-increasing complexity of organisation, towards spontaneity and spirituality, swept away all my old conception of a duty to Man as such. Man in himself is nothing. The forward movements of Life - the growing spirituality - is everything. I say to you quite freely, Ransom, that I should have been wrong in liquidating the Malacandrians. It was a mere prejudice that made me prefer our own race to theirs. To spread spirituality, not to spread the human race, is henceforth my mission. This sets the coping-stone on my career. I worked first for myself; then for science; then for humanity; but now at last for Spu1t itself - I might say, borrowing language which will be more familiar to you, the Holy Spirit \" Now what exactly do you mean by that?\" asked Ransom, \"I mean,\" said Weston, that nothing now divides you and me except a few outworn theological technicalities with which organised religion has unhappily allowed itself to get incrusted. But I have penetrated that crust. The Meaning beneath it is as true and living as ever. If you will excuse me for putting it that way, the essential truth of the religious view of life finds a remarkable witness in the fact that it enabled you, on Malacandra, to grasp, in your own mythical and imaginative fashion, a truth which was hidden from me.\" \"I don\u0027t know much about what people call the religious view of life,\" said Ransom, wrinkling his brow. \"You see, I\u0027m a Christian. And what we mean by the Holy Ghost is not a blind, inarticulate purposiveness.\" \"My dear Ransom,\" said Weston, \"I understand you perfectly. I have no doubt that my phraseology will seem strange to you, and perhaps even shocking. Early and revered associations may have put it out of your power to recognise in this new form the very same truths which religion has so long preserved and which science is now at last re-discovering. But whether you can see it or not, believe me, we are talking about exactly the same thing.\" \"I\u0027m not at all sure that we are.\" \"That, if you will permit me to say so, is one of the real weaknesses of organised religion - that adherence to formulae, the failure to recognise one\u0027s own friends. God is a spirit, Ransom. Get hold of that. You\u0027re familiar with that already. Stick to it God is a spirit.\" \"Well, of course. But what then?\" \"What then? Why, spirit - mind - freedom - spontaneity that\u0027s what I\u0027m talking about. That is the goal towards which the whole cosmic process is moving. The final disengagement of that freedom, that spirituality, is the work to which I dedicate my own life and the life of humanity. The goal, Ransom, the goal: think of it! Pure spirit: the final vortex of self-thinking, self-originating activity.\" \"Final?\" said Ransom. \"You mean it doesn\u0027t yet exist?\" \"Ah,\" said Weston, \"I see what\u0027s bothering you. Of course I know. Religion pictures it as being there from the beginning. But surely that is not a real difference? To make it one, would be to take time too seriously. When it has once been attained, you might then say it had been at the beginning just as well as at the end. Time is one of the things it will transcend.\" \"By the way,\" said Ransom, \"is it in any sense at all personal - is it alive?\" An indescribable expression passed over Weston\u0027s face. He moved a little nearer to Ransom and began speaking in a lower voice. \"That\u0027s what none of them understand,\" he said. It was such a gangster\u0027s or a schoolboy\u0027s whisper and so unlike his usual orotund lecturing style that Ransom for a moment felt a sensation almost of disgust. \"Yes,\" said Weston, \"I couldn\u0027t have believed, myself, till recently. Not a person, of course. Anthropomorphism is one of the childish diseases of popular religion\" (here he had resumed his public manner), \"but the opposite extreme of excessive abstraction has perhaps in the aggregate proved more disastrous. Call it a Force. A great, inscrutable Force, pouring up into us from the dark bases of being. A Force that can choose its instruments. It is only lately, Ransom, that I\u0027ve learned from actual experience something which you have believed all your life as part of your religion.\" Here he suddenly subsided again into a whisper - a croaking whisper unlike his usual voice. \"Guided,\" he said. \"Chosen. Guided. I\u0027ve become conscious that I\u0027m a man set apart. Why did I do physics? Why did I discover the Weston rays? Why did I go to Malacandra? It - the Force - has pushed me on all the time. I\u0027m being guided. I know now that I am the greatest scientist the world has yet produced. I\u0027ve been made so for a purpose. It is through me that Spirit itself is at this moment pushing on to its goal.\" \"Look here,\" said Ransom, \"one wants to be careful about this sort of thing. There are spirits and spirits, you know.\" \"Eh?\" said Weston. \"What are you talking about?\" \"I mean a thing might be a spirit and not good for you.\" \"But I thought you agreed that Spirit was the good - the end of the whole process? I thought you religious people were all out for spirituality? What is the point of asceticism - fasts and celibacy and all that? Didn\u0027t we agree that God is a spirit? Don\u0027t you worship Him because He is pure spirit?\" \"Good heavens, no! We worship Him because He is wise and good. There\u0027s nothing specially fine about simply being a spirit. The Devil is a spirit.\" \"Now your mentioning the Devil is very interesting,\" said Weston, who had by this time quite recovered his normal manner. \"It is a most interesting thing in popular religion, this tendency to fissiparate, to breed pairs of opposites: heaven and hell, God and Devil. I need hardly say that in my view no real dualism in the universe is admissible; and on that ground I should have been disposed, even a few weeks ago, to reject these pairs of doublets as pure mythology. It would have been a profound error. The cause of this universal religious tendency is to be sought much deeper. The doublets are really portraits of Spirit, of cosmic energy - self-portraits, indeed, for it is the Life-Force itself which has deposited them in our brains.\" \"What on earth do you mean?\" said Ransom. As he spoke he rose to his feet and began pacing to and fro. A quite appalling weariness and malaise had descended upon him. \"Your Devil and your God,\" said Weston, \"are both pictures of the same Force. Your heaven is a picture of the perfect spirituality ahead; your hell a picture of the urge or nisus which is driving us on to it from behind. Hence the static peace of the one and the fire and darkness of the other. The next stage of emergent evolution, beckoning us forward, is God; the transcended stage behind, ejecting us, is the Devil. Your own religion, after all, says that the devils are fallen angels.\" \"And you are saying precisely the opposite, as far as I can make out - that angels are devils who\u0027ve risen in the world.\" \"It comes to the same thing,\" said Weston. There was another long pause. \"Look here,\" said Ransom, \"it\u0027s easy to misunderstand one another on a point like this. What you are saying sounds to me like the most horrible mistake a man could fall into. But that may be because in the effort to accommodate it to my supposed \u0027religious views\u0027, you\u0027re saying a good deal more than you mean. It\u0027s only a metaphor, isn\u0027t it, all this about spirits and forces? I expect all you really mean is that you feel it your duty to work for the spread of civilisation and knowledge and that kind of thing.\" He had tried to keep out of his voice the involuntary anxiety which he had begun to feel. Next moment he recoiled in horror at the cackling laughter, almost an infantile or senile laughter, with which Weston replied. \"There you go, there you go,\" he said. \"Like all you religious people. You talk and talk about these things all your life, and the moment you meet the reality you get frightened.\" \"What proof,\" said Ransom (who indeed did feel frightened), \"what proof have you that you are being guided or supported by anything except your own individual mind and other people\u0027s books?\" \"You didn\u0027t notice, dear Ransom,\" said Weston, \"that I\u0027d improved a bit since we last met in my knowledge of extraterrestrial language. You are a philologist, they tell me.\" Ransom started. \"How did you do it?\" he blurted out. \"Guidance, you know, guidance,\" croaked Weston. He was squatting at the roots of his tree with his knees drawn up, and his face, now the colour of putty, wore a fixed and even slightly twisted grin. \"Guidance. Guidance,\" he went on. \"Things coming into my head. I\u0027m being prepared all the time. Being made a fit receptacle for it.\" \"That ought to be fairly easy,\" said Ransom impatiently. \"If this Life-Force is something so ambiguous that God and the Devil are equally good portraits of it, I suppose any receptacle is equally fit, and anything you can do is equally an expression of it.\" \"There\u0027s such a thing as the main current,\" said Weston. \"It\u0027s a question of surrendering yourself to that - making yourself the conductor of the live, fiery, central purpose - becoming the very finger with which it reaches forward.\" \"But I thought that was the Devil aspect of it, a moment ago \" \"That is the fundamental paradox. The thing we are reaching forward to is what you would call God. The reaching forward, the dynamism, is what people like you always call the Devil. The people like me, who do the reaching forward, are always martyrs. You revile us, and by us come to your goal.\" \"Does that mean in plainer language that the things the Force wants you to do are what ordinary people call diabolical?\" \"My dear Ransom, I wish you would not keep relapsing on to the popular level. The two things are only moments in the single, unique reality. The world leaps forward through great men and greatness always transcends mere moralism. When the leap has been made our \u0027diabolism\u0027 as you would call it becomes the morality of the next stage; but while we are making it, we are called criminals, heretics, blasphemers ...... \"How far does it go? Would you still obey the Life-Force if you found it prompting you to murder me?\" \"Yes. \" \"Or to sell England to the Germans?\" \"Yes.\" \"Or to print lies as serious research in a scientific periodical?\" \"Yes. \"God help you!\" said Ransom. \"You are still wedded to your conventionalities,\" said Weston. \"Still dealing in abstractions. Can you not even conceive a total commitment - a commitment to something which utterly overrides all our petty ethical pigeon-holes?\" Ransom grasped at the straw. \"Wait, Weston,\" he said abruptly. \"That may be a point of contact. You say it\u0027s a total commitment. That is, you\u0027re giving up yourself. You\u0027re not out for your own advantage. No, wait half a second. This is the point of contact between your morality and mine. We both acknowledge - \" \"Idiot,\" said Weston. His voice was almost a howl and he had risen to his feet. \"Idiot,\" he repeated. \"Can you understand nothing? Will you always try to press everything back Into the miserable framework of your old jargon about self and self-sacrifice? That is the old accursed dualism in another form. There is no possible distinction in concrete thought between me and the universe. In so far as I am the conductor of the central forward pressure of the universe, I am it. Do you see, you timid, scruple-mongering fool? I am the Universe. I, Weston, am your God - and your Devil. I call that Force into me completely .... \" Then horrible things began happening. A spasm like that preceding a deadly vomit twisted Weston\u0027s face out of recognition. As it passed, for one second something like the old Weston reappeared - the old Weston, staring with eyes of horror and howling, \"Ransom, Ransom! For Christ\u0027s sake don\u0027t let them - - \" and instantly his whole body spun round as if he had been hit by a revolver bullet and he fell to the earth, and was there rolling at Ransom\u0027s feet, slavering and chattering and tearing up the moss by handfuls. Gradually the convulsions decreased. He lay still, breathing heavily, his eyes open but without expression. Ransom was kneeling beside him now. It was obvious that the body was alive, and Ransom wondered whether this were a stroke or an epileptic fit, for he had never seen either. He rummaged among the packages and found a bottle of brandy which he uncorked and applied to the patient\u0027s mouth. To his consternation the teeth opened, closed on the neck of the bottle and bit it through. No glass was spat out. \"O God, I\u0027ve killed him,\" said Ransom. But beyond a spurt of blood at the lips there was no change in his appearance. The face suggested that either he was in no pain or in a pain beyond all human comprehension. Ransom rose at last, but before doing so he plucked the revolver from Weston\u0027s belt, then, walking down to the beach, he threw it as far as he could into the sea. He stood for some moments gazing out upon the bay and undecided what to do. Presently he turned and climbed up the turfy ridge that bordered the little valley on his left hand. He found himself on a fairly level upland with a good view of the sea, now running high and teased out of its level gold into a continually changing pattern of lights and shadows. For a second or two he could catch no sight of the islands. Then suddenly their tree-tops appeared, hanging high up against the sky, and widely separated. The weather, apparently, was already driving them apart - and even as he thought this they vanished once more into some unseen valley of the waves. What was his chance, he wondered, of ever finding them again? A sense of loneliness smote him, and then a feeling of angry frustration. I\u0026pound; Weston were dying, or even if Weston were to live, imprisoned here with him on an island they could not leave, what had been the danger he was sent to avert from Perelandra? And so, having begun to think of himself, he realised that he was hungry. He had seen neither fruit nor gourd on the Fixed Land. Perhaps it was a death trap. He smiled bitterly at the folly which had made him so glad, that morning, to exchange those floating paradises, where every grove dropped sweetness, for this barren rock. But perhaps it was not barren after all. Determined, despite the weariness which was every moment descending upon him, to make a search for food, he was just turning inland when the swift changes of colour that announce the evening of that world overtook him. Uselessly he quickened his pace. Before he had got down into the valley, the grove where he had left Weston was a mere cloud of darkness. Before he had reached it he was in seamless, undimensioned night. An effort or two to grope his way to the place where Weston\u0027s stores had been deposited only served to abolish his sense of direction altogether. He sat down perforce. He called Weston\u0027s name aloud once or twice but, as he expected, received no answer. \u0027I\u0027m glad I removed his gun, all the same,\u0027 thought Ransom; and then, \u0027Well, qui dort dine, and I suppose I must make the best of it till the morning.\u0027 When he lay down he discovered that the solid earth and moss of the Fixed Land was very much less comfortable than the surfaces to which he had lately been accustomed. That, and the thought of the other human being lying, no doubt, close at hand with open eyes and teeth clenched on splintered glass, and the sullen recurring pound of breakers on the beach, all made the night comfortless. \"If I lived on Perelandra,\" he muttered, \"Maleldil wouldn\u0027t need to forbid this island. I wish I\u0027d never set eyes on it.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/perelandra-space-trilogy-2/page-7.html","bookId":1689,"book":{"id":1689,"title":"Perelandra (Space Trilogy #2)","description":"Storyline: Perelandra (Space Trilogy #2) The second novel in Lewis\u0027s science fiction trilogy tells of Dr Ransom\u0027s voyage to the planet of Perelandra (Venus).
