I’ll be there, too.”\\n\\n Rich closed his eyes to the mounting frustration. This meeting with his parents was becoming a real spectacle, with Paul and Jason sitting on the sidelines. Rich wouldn’t be surprised if his parents brought in Taylor and Christy, too.\\n\\n His whole family was about to discover that Rich was the biggest fool who’d ever walked the earth.\\n\\n Twelve\\n\\n Both of Rich’s brothers were there waiting for him when he arrived at his parents’ home with Jamie at five minutes to six. Paul and Jason were perched on bar stools, holding pop cans, eager to view the latest family performance. The scene reminded Rich of one that had played out months earlier between his parents and his sister Christy when she’d announced her marriage to Cody Franklin. Rich remembered being amused by the circumstances then. Following in his youngest sister’s footsteps, however, was proving to be far less entertaining.\\n\\n His mother was on the phone, and from the way she was shaking her head and muttering under her breath, Rich realized she was probably talking to one of his sisters in Montana.\\n\\n He walked into the living room with Jamie beside him. He noticed how close she stood to him, which surprised him. At his office, they’d taken several minutes to review exactly what they planned to say.\\n\\n To him, the entire matter was cut-and-dried. He was in his thirties, certainly old enough to do as he pleased without his parents’ approval. Who and why Rich married was his own business, and that was how he intended to keep it. He’d convinced Jamie that, if necessary, he’d reveal the details of their arrangement, but he doubted it would come to that.\\n\\n After Rich and Jamie were seated, Eric Manning stalked into the living room. His father was tall and in excellent physical condition; his thick hair was nearly gray, and his hairline had barely begun to recede. He was in robust health and looked it.\\n\\n Rich’s two sisters claimed all the men in the Manning family were black-belt chauvinists. Rich hadn’t given it much thought, but he had definite ideas about a man’s responsibilities—to his wife and his family.\\n\\n “Rich,” his father said, nodding once. Eric’s face was grave, and the glance he shot Rich would have quelled Attila the Hun.\\n\\n “Dad.” Rich nodded, too. He chose to sit on the sofa, Jamie still at his side. He didn’t know whose hand reached out first, but their fingers entwined automatically, as though they gained strength from each other. Jamie appeared far more nervous than Rich, which, he supposed, was natural.\\n\\n “Your mother’s talking to Taylor,” his father said. “She’ll be finished in a few minutes.”\\n\\n So Rich had guessed correctly. His mother had managed to involve his oldest sister in this.\\n\\n “Would you care for something to drink?” Eric asked Jamie. “There’s cold pop, coffee or tea.”\\n\\n “Nothing, thanks,” she answered with a smile.\\n\\n Rich noticed that Jamie rested her free hand against her stomach, then drew in a deep, calming breath.\\n\\n “Are you feeling all right?” She’d mentioned not being well in the mornings, but he’d been so caught up in his own concerns that it had slipped his mind.\\n\\n “I’m fine.”\\n\\n “You’re looking pale.”\\n\\n “It’s nerves,” she whispered.\\n\\n “What about mornings?”\\n\\n Rich wasn’t especially thrilled to have his two brothers and his father monitoring his conversation, but he was worried about Jamie’s health and their baby’s.\\n\\n “My stomach’s still a little queasy, but I heard it’ll get better in a few months.”\\n\\n “The book I read says morning sickness should gradually disappear, starting at about the third month.” Rich had devoured the paperback on pregnancy and childbirth in one sitting, eager to read everything he could about the changes taking place in Jamie’s body. Eager to learn the most minute details about how his child was forming.\\n\\n Jamie’s eyes brightened. “You’re reading a book?”\\n\\n “It might surprise you to learn I read quite a bit,” he chided.\\n\\n “I know,” she whispered, and her gaze met his, faltering slightly. “I guess I’m surprised you’re reading one about pregnancy and childbirth.”\\n\\n “Why?”\\n\\n She shrugged. “It just does.”\\n\\n That didn’t say much for her view of him. Rich would have questioned her further, but his mother chose to enter the room just then. Elizabeth Manning smiled warmly in Jamie’s direction, but her eyes hardened as they slid toward Rich. He didn’t know what he’d done that was so terrible. His father had looked at him in much the same way, as though he should be taken out to the woodpile to have his backside tanned.\\n\\n “How’s Taylor?” Rich inquired conversationally, ignoring the censorious looks from both his parents. He kept his voice cool and even. He was actually proud of his composure.\\n\\n “Taylor’s fine. So are Russ and little Eric.”\\n\\n “That’s great.” Rich crossed his long legs and leaned against the couch. This wasn’t going to be nearly as bad as he’d suspected, as long as he kept a cool head.\\n\\n “Taylor’s decided to do some substitute teaching for the school district. Russ isn’t completely in favor of the idea, but he’s coming around.”\\n\\n Rich knew from experience that his oldest sister’s will was powerful enough to launch a rocket. Russ would do well to recognize that and act accordingly.\\n\\n “She was shocked to hear about you and Jamie getting married,” his mother continued, after drawing in a deep breath. “Which, I might add, came as a significant shock to your father and me, as well.”\\n\\n “Not me.” Jason spoke for the first time. “I knew about it from the beginning. In fact, I was Rich’s best man.”\\n\\n Everyone’s attention swung to Jason.\\n\\n “You knew?” their mother echoed, accusation in her voice.\\n\\n Jason nodded. “Trust me. I tried to talk him out of it, but you know how stubborn Rich can be. He refused to listen to the advice of his betters.”\\n\\n “You asked Jason to the ceremony and not your own mother?” Elizabeth Manning cried. She pulled a tissue from her pocket and dabbed at her eyes.\\n\\n “It was a civil ceremony at the King County courthouse,” Rich started to explain. He didn’t get very far. Once again he was interrupted by his mother.\\n\\n “You didn’t even marry Jamie in a church?” Elizabeth sounded as if this was the worst misdeed of all.\\n\\n “Don’t be upset, Mrs. Manning, I preferred it that way,” Jamie answered quietly.\\n\\n “But…why get married in a courthouse when you both belong to a church?”\\n\\n Jamie turned nervously to Rich. Now was the time to announce the reason for their impromptu wedding.\\n\\n Rich had it all worked out in his mind. The assurances, the brief but concise explanation of what had led to their unusual agreement. Yet when the moment arrived, Rich discovered he couldn’t make himself say it.\\n\\n “We did it that way for our own reasons,” was all the explanation he was willing to give. From the corner of his eye, Rich caught sight of Jason arching his brows.\\n\\n “According to Jamie’s mother, Jamie was already pregnant at the time of the wedding,” Eric bellowed. His hands clenched at his sides, he paced the length of the living room, then paused in front of the floor-to-ceiling windows, his back to Rich and Jamie. “A couple doesn’t need any more reason to marry quickly than that.”\\n\\n “I hate to disillusion you,” Rich reported calmly, “but as a matter of fact, Jamie wasn’t pregnant when we got married.”\\n\\n Elizabeth glared at him, her expression implying it was all a lie. Rich had no intention of arguing with either of his parents; they could believe what they wished.\\n\\n “Then why did Doris make a point of telling us the two of you had married because of the baby?” his mother asked.\\n\\n Rich groaned inwardly. “Because we’d decided Jamie should get pregnant as soon as possible.”\\n\\n Jamie exchanged a look with Rich, and added, “We’re married because we both want to become parents.”\\n\\n “I tried to tell Rich a wedding wasn’t necessary,” Jason inserted, “but he wouldn’t listen to me. He felt that if they were going to have a baby, he should marry her first. Go figure.”\\n\\n His mother gave Jason a horrified look. “I should certainly hope so.”\\n\\n Eric turned around to face them, frowning. “Trust me, parenthood’s not all it’s cracked up to be.”\\n\\n “Come on, Dad,” Paul teased. “It hasn’t been so bad, now, has it?”\\n\\n “When it comes to weddings,” Eric argued, “it’s been a nightmare. It was bad enough that your sisters had to get married on the sly—but I never suspected one of you boys would pull that stunt. I want to know when there’s going to be a real wedding in this family.”\\n\\n “Diane and I had a real wedding,” Paul reminded his father.\\n\\n “But no one from the Manning family was there.” Eric’s voice boomed. “The boy goes into the army, ships out to Alaska and returns home a married man.”\\n\\n “It was just one of those things,” Paul said, grinning.\\n\\n “Getting back to Rich and Jamie,” their mother said pointedly.\\n\\n “By all means,” Jason agreed, gesturing toward the sofa. “Let’s get back to Rich and Jamie. Do you realize, Mom and Dad, that they’re married and aren’t even living together?”\\n\\n Rich sent his brother a look hot enough to sizzle bacon.\\n\\n “Rich?” His mother turned to him expectantly.\\n\\n “Not living together? Why not? You’re married, aren’t you?” His father fired rapid questions at them. “What about—”\\n\\n “We’re married,” Rich broke in.\\n\\n “But you’re not living together?”\\n\\n “Not…yet.” It was the best evasion Rich could come up with on such short notice. This was a subject he’d hoped to avoid, along with several others.\\n\\n “They plan to move in together soon, isn’t that right, Rich?” his mother asked.\\n\\n “Of course.” It was Jamie who responded, and Rich stared at her. He couldn’t help wondering if she was sincere or if her sudden reassurances were all part of an act to appease his parents. Not that Rich had any objection to moving in with Jamie.\\n\\n “Are there problems with your lease?” his mother asked next.\\n\\n “Uh, I’m working on it,” Rich muttered noncommittally.\\n\\n “I hope you’ll move in with her soon,” Eric asserted, burying his hands in his pants pockets. “A pregnant woman needs her husband.”\\n\\n “You’re absolutely positive you’re pregnant, Jamie, dear?” Elizabeth Manning’s voice was filled with gentle concern.\\n\\n “Absolutely positive,” Jamie said with a firm nod. “The kit I bought at the drugstore is very reliable, but I was at the doctor’s this afternoon and he confirmed it.”\\n\\n “You went to the doctor?” Rich asked before he could stop himself. They’d spent half an hour at his office discussing this meeting and she hadn’t said a word about seeing Dr. Fullerton! \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/marriage-of-inconvenience-those-manning-men-1/page-25.html","bookId":1981,"book":{"id":1981,"title":"Marriage of Inconvenience (Those Manning Men #1)","description":"Storyline: Marriage of Inconvenience (Those Manning Men #1) \\n Rich Manning had known Jamie Warren forever.
