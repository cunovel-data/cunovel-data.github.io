Oh, no, you knew so much better.”\\n\\n “I still do.”\\n\\n Jamie couldn’t help it, she stamped her foot. She hadn’t done anything so childish since junior high. “Look at us,” she cried, her voice shaking with anger. “I’m… I’m not even pregnant yet and already we’re fighting. We’re going to ruin everything fighting over something so…stupid.”\\n\\n “It isn’t stupid to me.”\\n\\n “Floyd is just a friend. For heaven’s sake, he’s married!”\\n\\n “So are you.”\\n\\n “Why are you doing this?” she cried.\\n\\n “All I’m asking is that you keep your part of the bargain and I’ll keep mine. That shouldn’t be so difficult.”\\n\\n “Oh, right,” she said, walking around the table and leaning on the back of a chair. “There’s a lot more involved in this arrangement than I ever knew about or agreed to and—”\\n\\n “Like what?”\\n\\n “Like…like your caveman attitude toward me.”\\n\\n “Caveman? Because I don’t want my wife dating another man—another married man?” He glared across the room at her. “Forgive me if I’m wrong, but I seem to remember a phrase or two in the wedding vows that state—”\\n\\n “Don’t you dare.” Jamie pointed an accusing finger at his chest. “Don’t you dare,” she repeated. “I never wanted to go through with the wedding, and you knew it. Using it against me now is the height of unfairness.”\\n\\n “We’re married, Jamie, whether you like it or not.”\\n\\n “I don’t like it, I hate it. I hate everything about it—this is the biggest mistake of my life.” Unable to bear any more arguing, she whirled around and covered her face with her hands. If there was any decency left in him, Rich Manning would go. He’d leave her alone.\\n\\n Jamie’s nerves were raw, and the hair at the nape of her neck bristled as she heard Rich walk toward her. The clipped pace of his steps did nothing to reassure her.\\n\\n “Did he kiss you?”\\n\\n “No!” she shouted, furious that he’d ask such an outrageous question.\\n\\n “Good, because I’m going to.” His hands moved over her shoulders, clasping them, holding her in place.\\n\\n “No.” She made one weak protest, but she didn’t know who she was talking to, Rich or herself. He’d kissed her once, the day of their wedding, and it had obsessed her ever since. She couldn’t allow him to destroy her equilibrium again, destroy her peace of mind.\\n\\n Although she resisted, Rich turned her around to face him. Jamie was on fire, and he’d barely touched her.\\n\\n Rich took hold of her chin, his fingers firm, yet oddly gentle. Without another word, he bent down and covered her mouth with his own. Jamie knew she shouldn’t let him do this. Not in the heat of anger. Not when they were fighting. Not when his kiss would only create a need for more.\\n\\n He tasted so good, so wonderful. It wasn’t fair. Nothing about this so-called marriage was fair.\\n\\n He moved his mouth over hers, shaping her lips with his own until she moaned. It seemed to be what he was waiting for. The instant her lips parted, his tongue swept inside.\\n\\n Shock waves vibrated through her at the small, ruthless movements of his tongue. Jamie could feel herself melting against him. The need continued to build within her, licking at her senses, growing hotter and stronger and fiercer….\\n\\n Not satisfied with her lips alone, he kissed her eyes, her throat, until Jamie felt as if she was about to ignite.\\n\\n A frightening excitement exploded inside her, going beyond mere pleasure and quickly advancing to a demand so intense there would be no turning back for either of them.\\n\\n “Rich…no.” She braced her hands against his chest, wanting to use that leverage to break away.\\n\\n “Yes,” he countered with a groan. His arms circled her waist, and he lifted her effortlessly from the floor, adjusting her hips against his own so she was aware of what she was doing to him—of the need she’d created in him.\\n\\n Jamie slipped her arms around his neck, inclined her head and kissed him back. She felt sensual, wanton…and a little scared.\\n\\n A low, rough sound rumbled from deep within his throat.\\n\\n “Rich…please, oh, please, we’ve got to stop.” Her heart was reeling with excitement but she was terrified of where this might lead. Terrified that, after tonight, she’d never be able to live with a marriage that wasn’t a marriage.\\n\\n “Not yet.” He pressed his lips to her neck, running the tip of his tongue across the smooth skin of her throat and up the underside of her jaw. Jamie threw back her head. A ribbon of warm pleasure braided its way down her spine.\\n\\n She buried her fingers in his hair and sighed, feeling breathless and hot. So breathless she could barely gulp in enough air. So hot. Hotter than she’d ever been.\\n\\n He lifted her higher, leaning her against the kitchen counter. His hands worked the buttons of her blouse, sliding it from her shoulders. Her bra closed in the back, and he reached for and found the clasp.\\n\\n “Tell me what you want,” he whispered, caressing her thighs, stroking them as he spread delicate, moist kisses across her neck.\\n\\n “I …don’t know.”\\n\\n “Funny, I do,” he countered with a lazy, sexy laugh. “You want me.”\\n\\n Jamie couldn’t disagree. She could barely speak as a powerful coil of need tightened within her.\\n\\n “Deny it.” His tongue moistened a trail from the hollow at the base of her throat to her trembling chin.\\n\\n “I can’t.”\\n\\n “Me, neither.” He swept her from the counter, shifting her weight until she was completely in his arms. He carried her as if she weighed nothing at all and headed out of the kitchen. He paused to turn off the light.\\n\\n “Rich.” She had to say something before it was too late. “We’ll regret this in the morning.” Even as she spoke, she wound her arms around his neck.\\n\\n “Maybe.” He didn’t bother to deny it, but it didn’t stop him, either.\\n\\n Her bedroom was dark. Moonlight splashed through the open drapes, and Rich slowly lowered her onto the bed.\\n\\n There was no turning back now.\\n\\n Seven\\n\\n They were silent afterward, their breathing labored, their chests heaving. Rich wished Jamie would say something. Anything. She didn’t, and slowly reality returned, inexplicably linked with the glory of what they’d shared.\\n\\n Rich kissed her softly, gently, with none of the urgency he’d felt earlier. He slid his fingers into the silky length of her hair and sighed with satisfaction. He kissed her again, reveling in her warm, sweet taste. He longed for her to tell him she experienced no remorse over their lovemaking. He’d been so angry, such a jealous idiot, and one thing had led to another. Before he could stop it, they were making love. She’d warned him, claimed they’d be left with regrets, but he felt none. Only a powerful sense of honesty.\\n\\n Rich realized his weight was too much for her, but when he tried to move, she resisted, tightening her hold on him, hooking her ankles over his.\\n\\n “Don’t leave me,” she whispered.\\n\\n “No.” He had no intention of doing so. “But I’m too heavy for you.”\\n\\n “Stay with me like this. Please.” She stroked his back, her touch featherlight.\\n\\n He would stay like this because she asked, but only for a little while. They both needed sleep and the thought of waking up beside her thrilled him almost as much as the memory of everything they’d done together in the last hour.\\n\\n The silvery moonlight illuminated her face. He noticed that her eyes were languorous, her face flushed with pleasure. Her lips were turned up slightly in a secret smile. A serene, womanly smile. Just watching her, loving her, brought him peace. Because he did love her, and he was astonished that he hadn’t recognized it earlier. Astonished at his own lack of perception. The love he felt for her burned within his chest, literally burned. The depth of emotion he felt had everything to do with this woman, and the profound pleasure he’d experienced was only part of that.\\n\\n Her skin felt like silk beneath his hands as he brushed his fingertips down the side of her face. She sighed, and her breath caught in her throat.\\n\\n Rarely had Rich experienced such contentment. The magnitude of it left him feeling weak and humble. Tucking his arms securely around Jamie’s waist, he rolled onto his back, taking her with him. She made a small sound of surprise, then smiled peacefully, nestled her head on his chest and closed her eyes. Within minutes, she was asleep.\\n\\n Slumber didn’t claim him as quickly. He remained in awe of the emotions crowding his heart. For years he’d been blind and deaf when it came to his feelings for Jamie. Others had seen it. James had immediately recognized the love Rich felt for her and said as much. Rich had been quick to laugh and deny what was obvious to everyone but himself.\\n\\n It had taken an argument to push him over the edge, push them both past the point of no return. If he had any regrets, it was that this discovery had come so late—and on the heels of a heated exchange.\\n\\n He sighed and watched Jamie in the moonlight. She slept, utterly tranquil, and his heart swelled with a love so strong it was all he could do not to wake her and tell her what he was feeling. He wanted to, but it would be selfish not to let her sleep. He kissed her temple and closed his eyes, content to keep his wife secure in his arms.\\n\\n Sometime toward dawn, Rich woke. Jamie was sleeping on her side and he was cuddling her, their bodies pressed intimately together. He smiled, a smile that came from his heart. They were like a long-married couple, completely comfortable with each other, as though they’d been sleeping together for years.\\n\\n This was exactly what Rich intended, to continue sleeping with Jamie night after night for the rest of their lives. They’d grow old that way, gracefully, together. God willing, they’d raise several children, who’d be sheltered by the love their parents shared.\\n\\n Rich stirred once more a little after six. Yawning, he stretched his arms above his head. He’d been working a lot of extra hours on a contract Boeing had with the government and he needed to get to work soon, despite the weekend.\\n\\n He slipped out of bed and gazed down on Jamie, then leaned over and gently kissed her forehead. Hurrying to the shower, he whistled a cheerful tune.\\n\\n In a joyous mood, Rich sang at the top of his lungs. He expected Jamie to be awake when he returned to the bedroom, but was disappointed to discover she was still asleep. He dressed and went out the door. He’d phone her later, as soon as he had a chance. He tended to get involved in his work and forget about the time, but he’d try not to let that happen. They had to talk.\\n\\n Jamie woke at eight. Although she was sleeping on her side, facing the wall, she sensed almost immediately that Rich had gone.\\n\\n He’d left without a word. Abandoned her to deal with the emptiness of the morning. Alone.\\n\\n Closing her eyes, she bit her lower lip. The feeling of betrayal, of total isolation, was unlike anything she’d ever experienced. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/marriage-of-inconvenience-those-manning-men-1/page-14.html","bookId":1981,"book":{"id":1981,"title":"Marriage of Inconvenience (Those Manning Men #1)","description":"Storyline: Marriage of Inconvenience (Those Manning Men #1) \\n Rich Manning had known Jamie Warren forever.
