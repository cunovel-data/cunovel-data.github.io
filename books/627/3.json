{"id":19207,"no":3,"title":"Chapter 2","content":"Mrs. Jewls had a terribly nice face. She stood at the bottom of Wayside School and looked up. She was supposed to teach the class on the thirtieth story. The children on the thirtieth story were scared. They had never told anybody what had happened to Mrs. Gorf. They hadn\u0027t had a teacher for three days. They were afraid of what their new teacher would be like. They had heard she\u0027d be a terribly nice teacher. They had never had a nice teacher. They were terribly afraid of nice teachers. Mrs. Jewls walked up the winding, creaking staircaseto the thirtieth story. She was also afraid. She was afraid of the children. She had heard that they would be horribly cute children. She had never taught cute children. She was horribly afraid of cute children. She opened the door to the classroom. She was terribly nice. The children could tell just by looking at her. Mrs. Jewls looked at the children. They were horribly cute. In fact, they were much too cute to be children. \"I don\u0027t believe it,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"It\u0027s a room full of monkeys!\" The children looked at each other. They didn\u0027t see any monkeys. \"This is ridiculous,\" said Mrs. Jewls, \"just ridiculous. I walked all the way up thirty flights of stairs for nothing but a class of monkeys. What do they think I am? I\u0027m a teacher, not a zookeeper!\" The children looked at her. They didn\u0027t know what to say. Todd scratched his head. \"Oh, I\u0027m sorry,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"Please don\u0027t get me wrong. I have nothing against monkeys. It is just that I was expecting children. I like monkeys. I really do. Why, I\u0027m sure we can play all kinds of monkey games.\" \"What are you talking about?\" asked Todd. Mrs. Jewls nearly fell off her chair. \"Well, what do you know, a talking monkey. Tomorrow I\u0027ll bring you a banana.\" \"My name is Todd,\" said Todd. The children were flabbergasted. They all raised their hands. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" said Mrs. Jewls, \"but I don\u0027t haveenough bananas for all of you. I didn\u0027t expect this. Next week I\u0027ll bring in a whole bushel.\" \"I don\u0027t want a banana,\" said Calvin. \"I\u0027m not a monkey.\" \"Would you like a peanut?\" asked Mrs. Jewls. \"I think I might have a bag of peanuts in my purse. Wait a second. Yes, here it is.\" \"Thanks,\" said Calvin. Calvin liked peanuts. Allison stood up. \"I\u0027m not a monkey,\" she said. \"I\u0027m a girl. My name is Allison. And so is everybody else.\" Mrs. Jewls was shocked. \"Do you mean to tell me that every monkey in here is named Allison?\" \"No,\" said Jenny. \"She means we are all children. My name is Jenny.\" \"No,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"You\u0027re much too cute to be children.\" Jason raised his hand. \"Yes,\" said Mrs. Jewls, \"the chimpanzee in the red shirt.\" \"My name is Jason,\" said Jason, \"and I\u0027m not a chimpanzee.\" \"You\u0027re too small to be a gorilla,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"I\u0027m a boy,\" said Jason. \"You\u0027re not a monkey?\" asked Mrs. Jewls. \"No,\" said Jason. \"And the rest of the class, they\u0027re not monkeys, either?\" asked Mrs. Jewls. \"No,\" said Allison. \"That is what we\u0027ve been trying to tell you.\" \"Are you sure?\" asked Mrs. Jewls. \"We\u0027d know if we were monkeys, wouldn\u0027t we?\" asked Calvin. \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"Do monkeys know that they are monkeys?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Allison. \"I\u0027m not a monkey.\" \"No, I suppose you\u0027re not,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"Okay, in that case, we have a lot of work to do-reading, writing, subtraction, addition, spelling. Everybody take out a piece of paper. We will have a test now.\" Jason tapped Todd on the shoulder. He said, \"Do you want to know something? I liked it better when she thought we were monkeys.\" \"I know,\" said Todd. \"I guess now it means she won\u0027t bring me a banana.\" \"There will be no talking in class,\" said Mrs. Jewls. She wrote Todd\u0027s name on the blackboard under the word DISCIPLINE.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1988/56809.html","bookId":627,"book":{"id":627,"title":"歪歪小学的荒诞故事 Sideways Stories from Wayside School","description":"简介： 当路易斯．萨奇尔还是学生时，他的老师们总是念错他的名字。现在，他变成有名的童书作家，不同地方的老师还是念错他的名字。在他们家族，这个姓氏的发音是萨「克」尔，但事实上这个字正统的发音为萨「奇」尔，你说怪不怪。三十层楼的教室里，有个很坏的老师，你不乖，她...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201802/28/11-07-35-80-1.jpg","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1988","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM"}}
