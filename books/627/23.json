She was best friends with Rondi. Rondi had blonde hair, too, but she was missing her two front teeth. Allison had all of her teeth. \n \n Allison used to say that she knocked Rondi\u0027s teeth out. Allison was very pretty, so all the boys in Mrs. Jewls\u0027s class teased her, especially Jason. But Allison said, \"Leave me alone or I\u0027ll knock your teeth out- like I did Rondi\u0027s.\" The boys didn\u0027t bother her after that. \n 86One day Allison brought a tangerine for lunch. She took the peel off in one piece. \n Miss Mush, the lunch teacher, walked up to her. \"Allison, may I have your tangerine?\" she asked. \n \n Miss Mush always gave food to the children. So Allison was happy to give her tangerine to Miss Mush. \n \n Miss Mush shoved it in her mouth and swallowed it in less than four seconds. \n \n Allison left the lunchroom and walked down to the library. The lunchroom was on the fifteenth story. The library was on the seventh. Allison already had her book. She just went to the library because it was nice and quiet there. \n \n The librarian walked up to Allison. \"What are you reading?\" she asked. \n \n Allison told her the name of the book. \n \n \"That sounds like a good book,\" said the librarian. \"I never read that one. May I borrow it?\" \n \n The librarian always lent books to the children. Allison was glad to be able to return the favor. She gave the librarian the book, then walked down the stairs, outside to the playground. \n \n All of Allison\u0027s friends were playing freeze tag. Allison didn\u0027t feel like playing. She reached into the pocket of her sky-blue windbreaker and took out a tennis ball. She bounced it a couple of times on the ground. \n \n Louis came up to her. \"Hi, Allison,\" he said. \"May I play with your tennis ball?\" \n \n Louis always gave balls to the children. Allison happily gave her ball to Louis. \n \n Louis threw the ball all the way to the other side of the playground. Then he went chasing after it. \n 87Allison didn\u0027t feel like doing anything. Jason ran up and tagged her. \n \"You\u0027re frozen,\" he said. \n \n \"Get out of here before I knock your teeth out,\" said Allison. \n \n Jason shrugged his shoulders and left. \n \n Allison went back inside and up the thirty flights of stairs to Mrs. Jewls\u0027s room. The lunch period wasn\u0027t over yet, but Allison didn\u0027t feel like doing anything else. She had given her food to the lunch teacher, her book to the librarian, and her ball to the yard teacher. She went inside her classroom. \n \n Mrs. Jewls was there. \"Oh, Allison, I\u0027m glad you\u0027re here,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"I\u0027m having trouble with an arithmetic problem. Maybe you can help.\" \n \n \"Sure,\" said Allison. Mrs. Jewls always helped the children with their problems. Allison was happy to help. \n \n \"How do you spellchair?\"asked Mrs. Jewls. \n \n \"C-H-A-I-R,\" said Allison. \n \n \"Yes, that\u0027s right,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"I knew it wasn\u0027t C-H-A-R-E, but I couldn\u0027t remember what it was.\" \n \n \"That\u0027s not an arithmetic problem,\" said Allison. \"That\u0027s spelling.\" \n \n \"Yes, you are right again,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"I always get the two mixed up.\" \n \n The bell rang. The lunch period was over. Allison could hear the other children running up the stairs. \n \n \"Allison,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"You learned a very important secret today, and I don\u0027t want you to tell any of the other children, not even Rondi.\" \n 88\"What was that?\" asked Allison. She didn\u0027t even know she had learned a secret. She loved secrets. \n \"You learned that children are really smarter than their teachers,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \n \n \"Oh, that\u0027s no secret,\" said Allison. \"Everybody knows that.\" \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1988/56829.html","bookId":627,"book":{"id":627,"title":"歪歪小学的荒诞故事 Sideways Stories from Wayside School","description":"简介： 当路易斯．萨奇尔还是学生时，他的老师们总是念错他的名字。现在，他变成有名的童书作家，不同地方的老师还是念错他的名字。在他们家族，这个姓氏的发音是萨「克」尔，但事实上这个字正统的发音为萨「奇」尔，你说怪不怪。三十层楼的教室里，有个很坏的老师，你不乖，她...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201802/28/11-07-35-80-1.jpg","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1988","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM"}}
