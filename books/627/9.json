{"id":19213,"no":9,"title":"Chapter 8","content":"Myron had big ears. He was elected class president. The children in Mrs. Jewls\u0027s class expected him to be a good president. Other presidents were good speakers. Myron was even better. He was a good listener. \\n\\n \\n\\n But he had a problem. He didn\u0027t know what a class president was supposed to do. So he asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What am I supposed to do?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s a difficult job,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"But you can do it. You must turn the lights on every morning and turn them off at the end of the day.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What?\" asked Myron. \\n\\n 32\"As a class president you must learn to listen,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"I\u0027ll repeat myself only one more time. You must turn the lights on every morning-\" \\n\\n \"I heard you the first time,\" said Myron. \"It just doesn\u0027t sound like much of a job.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It certainly is!\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"Without light I can\u0027t teach, and the children can\u0027t learn. Only you can give us that light. I think it is a very important job.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I guess so,\" said Myron. He wasn\u0027t convinced. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Here, let me show you how to work a light switch,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I already know how,\" said Myron. \"I\u0027ve been turning lights on and off all my life.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Very good!\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"You\u0027ll make a fine president.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Myron wanted to be the best president ever. But it was such an easy job, he thought, that anybody could do it. When school let out that day, Myron stayed behind. He turned out the lights by flicking the switch down. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Excellent!\" said Mrs. Jewls. \\n\\n \\n\\n On his way home, Myron heard a horrible noise. First there was a loud screeching, then a sharp squeal, a roaring engine, and then the very faint sound of a girl crying. \\n\\n \\n\\n Myron ran to see what had happened. \\n\\n \\n\\n Dana was bent over in the middle of the road. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What\u0027s the matter?\" asked Myron. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My dog, Pugsy, was hit by a car,\" Dana cried. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Who did it?\" asked Myron. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know!\" Dana sobbed. \"They sped away.\" \\n\\n 33\"Well, that\u0027s not important,\" said Myron. \"We\u0027ve got to try to save Pugsy.\" \\n\\n Pugsy lay unconscious in the street. Myron carefully picked her up. He carried her two miles to the vet. Dana cried at his side. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t worry, Dana,\" said Myron. \"She\u0027ll be all right.\" But he wasn\u0027t really so sure. \\n\\n \\n\\n He gave Pugsy to the vet, walked Dana home, then walked home himself. \\n\\n \\n\\n Dana was so upset that she forgot to thank him. Myron didn\u0027t mind. He thought that was what being class president was all about. \\n\\n \\n\\n The next morning, before he went to school, Myron went to Dana\u0027s house. Pugsy was there. She seemed all right. \\n\\n \\n\\n Dana petted her. Pugsy licked her face. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"See, Myron, she\u0027s all right,\" said Dana. \"The vet said that you brought her in just in time.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hi, Pugsy,\" said Myron. He petted her. \\n\\n \\n\\n Pugsy bit his hand. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I guess she doesn\u0027t know you,\" said Dana. \"She was unconscious yesterday when you saved her life.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Dana\u0027s mother put some medicine and a Band-Aid on Myron\u0027s hand. Then she drove the children to school. \\n\\n \\n\\n They were late. They ran up the stairs to Mrs. Jewls\u0027s class. The room was completely dark. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s about time you got here, Myron,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"We have no lights.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why didn\u0027t somebody else just turn them on?\" asked Myron. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Because you\u0027re class president,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \\n\\n 34\"Show Stephen how to work the lights. From now on he will be class president.\" \\n\\n Myron showed Stephen how to turn on the lights. He flicked the switch up. \\n\\n \\n\\n At the end of the day, Myron showed Stephen how to turn the lights off. He flicked the switch down. \\n\\n \\n\\n After a week, Stephen finally caught on. He made a good president. The lights were on every morning. \\n\\n \\n\\n Myron, who was president for only a day, was the best president in the history of Wayside School. It was just that nobody knew it. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1988/56815.html","bookId":627,"book":{"id":627,"title":"歪歪小学的荒诞故事 Sideways Stories from Wayside School","description":"简介： 当路易斯．萨奇尔还是学生时，他的老师们总是念错他的名字。现在，他变成有名的童书作家，不同地方的老师还是念错他的名字。在他们家族，这个姓氏的发音是萨「克」尔，但事实上这个字正统的发音为萨「奇」尔，你说怪不怪。三十层楼的教室里，有个很坏的老师，你不乖，她...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201802/28/11-07-35-80-1.jpg","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1988","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM"}}
