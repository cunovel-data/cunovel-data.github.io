{"id":19221,"no":17,"title":"Chapter 16","content":"D.J. skipped up the thirty flights of stairs to Mrs. Jewls\u0027s room. He was grinning from ear to ear, from nose to chin, from here to there, and back again. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hey, D.J.,\" Todd shouted, \"glad to see you.\" Todd was a pushover for smiling faces. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Jewls heard him. She began to write Todd\u0027s name on the board under DISCIPLINE, but when she saw D.J.\u0027s smile, she put down the chalk. \"Good morning, D.J.,\" she said. \"What are you so happy about?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n DJ. grinned and shrugged his shoulders. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Jewls smiled. \\n\\n 65Dameon looked at the smile on Mrs. Jewls\u0027s face, then at Todd\u0027s, and finally at D.J.\u0027s. Then Dameon smiled, too. His smile was almost as big as D.J.\u0027s. They were best friends. \\n\\n Once they saw the two of them smiling, the rest of the class couldn\u0027t help but smile. Rondi had a very cute one, due to her two missing front teeth. Nobody had an ugly smile. \\n\\n \\n\\n Jason came to school late. He was very upset. But the first thing he saw was Dameon\u0027s smile, and he felt a little bit better. Then he saw Rondi\u0027s toothless grin, and he even began to smile a little himself. But when he saw the piano on D.J.\u0027s face, he fell, laughing, onto the floor. \\n\\n \\n\\n Everybody started to laugh, even Kathy, and she hardly ever laughed except when someone hurt himself. \\n\\n \\n\\n The whole room seemed to be laughing, not just the people in it. The blackboard chuckled. The ceiling snickered. The desks were jumping up and down, and the chairs were slapping one another on the back. The floor was very ticklish. It laughed until the walls turned purple. The wastepaper basket started to sing, and all the pencils stood up and danced. \\n\\n \\n\\n Finally things began to settle down. Mrs. Jewls wiped her eyes and said, \"D.J., why don\u0027t you tell the class why you are so happy? At least let us know what we are laughing about.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But D.J. just kept on smiling. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Aw, come on, D.J.,\" said Deedee. \"Tell us.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n D.J. didn\u0027t say a word. He couldn\u0027t. His mouth was stretched out of shape. \\n\\n 66\"Let us guess,\" said Ron. \"If we guess right, will you tell us?\" \\n\\n D.J. nodded his head. His smile began to hurt his ears. \\n\\n \\n\\n Everyone took one guess. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Have you been swimming?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is it your birthday?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Are you in love?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Did you get a green ball?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Nobody guessed right. \\n\\n \\n\\n At recess D.J. was still smiling. \\n\\n \\n\\n Louis, the yard teacher, called, \"Hey, D.J. Come here.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n They walked to the far corner of the playground, where they were alone. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What\u0027s up, D.J.?\" Louis asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n D.J. just smiled. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Come on, D.J. You can tell me. Why are you so happy?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n D.J. looked up at him. He said, \"You need a reason to be sad. You don\u0027t need a reason to be happy.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1988/56823.html","bookId":627,"book":{"id":627,"title":"歪歪小学的荒诞故事 Sideways Stories from Wayside School","description":"简介： 当路易斯．萨奇尔还是学生时，他的老师们总是念错他的名字。现在，他变成有名的童书作家，不同地方的老师还是念错他的名字。在他们家族，这个姓氏的发音是萨「克」尔，但事实上这个字正统的发音为萨「奇」尔，你说怪不怪。三十层楼的教室里，有个很坏的老师，你不乖，她...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201802/28/11-07-35-80-1.jpg","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1988","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM"}}
