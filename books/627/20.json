{"id":19224,"no":20,"title":"Chapter 19","content":"Kathy doesn\u0027t like you. She doesn\u0027t know you, but she still doesn\u0027t like you. She thinks you are stupid! In fact, she thinks you are the stupidest person she doesn\u0027t know. What do you think of that? \\n\\n \\n\\n She also thinks you\u0027re ugly! As a matter of fact, she thinks you are the ugliest person she doesn\u0027t know. And she doesn\u0027t know a lot of people. \\n\\n \\n\\n She doesn\u0027t like the people she knows, either. She hates everybody in Mrs. Jewls\u0027s class. She did like one member of the class. She liked Sammy. She thought he was funny. Sammy was a dead rat. \\n\\n 76But Kathy has good reasons for not liking any of the children she knows. She doesn\u0027t like D.J. because he smiles too much, and she doesn\u0027t like John because he can\u0027t stand on his head. \\n\\n Kathy once had a cat named Skunks. She liked Skunks. But she was afraid that Skunks would run away. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You have nothing to worry about, Kathy,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"Skunks won\u0027t run away. Just be nice to him and feed him and pet him, and he won\u0027t run away. He may go out and play, but he\u0027ll always come back.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, you\u0027re wrong, Mrs. Jewls,\" said Kathy. \"What do you know! He\u0027ll run away.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n So Kathy kept Skunks locked up in her closet at home. She never let him out and sometimes even forgot to feed him. \\n\\n \\n\\n One day, while Kathy was looking for her other shoe, Skunks ran out of the closet and never came back. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You said he would come back, Mrs. Jewls,\" said Kathy. \"He never came back. You were wrong. I was right.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n That was why Kathy didn\u0027t like Mrs. Jewls. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The next time I get a cat, I\u0027ll kill him. Then he\u0027ll never run away,\" said Kathy. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then there was the time that Dameon tried to teach Kathy how to play catch. \\n\\n \\n\\n Dameon said, \"When I throw you the ball, Kathy, try to catch it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I can\u0027t catch it,\" said Kathy. \"I\u0027ll just get hurt.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You won\u0027t get hurt,\" Dameon insisted. \"Just watch the ball.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He tossed it to her. \\n\\n 77But Kathy knew she\u0027d get hurt. So she closed her eyes. The ball hit her on the cheek. It hurt. \\n\\n Kathy began to cry. \"You were wrong,\" she sobbed. \"I was right!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n That was why Kathy didn\u0027t like Dameon. \\n\\n \\n\\n Allison believed that if you are nice to someone, then they\u0027ll be nice to you. So one day she brought Kathy a cookie. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want your ugly cookie,\" said Kathy. \"It probably tastes terrible!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Allison said, \"No, it is very good. I made it myself.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Kathy said, \"If you made it, then it must stink! You can\u0027t cook. You\u0027re too stupid!\" She just put the cookie in her desk along with her pencils, crayons, and books. \\n\\n \\n\\n Three weeks later, Kathy was hungry. \"All right, Allison,\" she said. \"I\u0027ll try your stupid cookie.\" She took it out of her desk. It was covered with dust. She bit it. It was hard and tasted terrible. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"See,\" said Kathy. \"I was right!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n That was why Kathy didn\u0027t like Allison. \\n\\n \\n\\n Yes, Kathy had very good reasons for not liking anybody she knew. \\n\\n \\n\\n But she also has a good reason for not liking you. And she doesn\u0027t even know you. Her reason is this. She knows that if you ever met her, you wouldn\u0027t like her. You don\u0027t like Kathy, do you? \\n\\n \\n\\n See, she was right! \\n\\n \\n\\n It\u0027s funny how a person can be right all the time and still be wrong. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1988/56826.html","bookId":627,"book":{"id":627,"title":"歪歪小学的荒诞故事 Sideways Stories from Wayside School","description":"简介： 当路易斯．萨奇尔还是学生时，他的老师们总是念错他的名字。现在，他变成有名的童书作家，不同地方的老师还是念错他的名字。在他们家族，这个姓氏的发音是萨「克」尔，但事实上这个字正统的发音为萨「奇」尔，你说怪不怪。三十层楼的教室里，有个很坏的老师，你不乖，她...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201802/28/11-07-35-80-1.jpg","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1988","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM"}}
