And there were an awful lot of big mouths in that class. \n \n \"Mrs. Jewls,\" Jason called without raising his hand. \"Joy is chewing gum in class!\" \n \n Joy had the biggest mouth in Mrs. Jewls\u0027s class. And it was filled with gum. There was hardly even room for her tongue. \n \n \"Joy, I\u0027m ashamed of you,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"I\u0027m afraid I\u0027ll have to put your name up on the board.\" \n \n \"That\u0027s okay, Mrs. Jewls,\" Jason called. \"I\u0027ll do it.\" \n 48Jason hopped out of his seat and wrote Joy\u0027s name on the blackboard under the word DISCIPLINE. \n While he was up, Joy took the glob of gum out of her mouth and placed it on Jason\u0027s chair. \n \n Rondi and Allison giggled. \n \n Jason walked back from the blackboard to his desk and sat down. \"Mrs. Jewls,\" he called, \"I\u0027m STUCK!\" \n \n Rondi and Allison giggled again. \n \n Mrs. Jewls got angry. \"Joy, you\u0027re going home on the kindergarten bus today.\" \n \n \"Oh, good,\" said Todd. \"I\u0027ll have some company.\" Todd went home on the kindergarten bus every day. He could never seem to make it to twelve o\u0027clock without getting into trouble three times. His name wasn\u0027t even up on the blackboard yet. But he knew that by twelve o\u0027clock it would be up, checked, and circled. \n \n \"Mrs. Jewls, what am I going to do? I\u0027m stuck! I\u0027m going to have to stay here the rest of my life!\" said Jason. \n \n \"Joy, tell Jason you\u0027re sorry,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \n \n \"I\u0027m sorry, Jason,\" said Joy. \n \n \"Oh, that\u0027s okay, Joy,\" said Jason. \"I don\u0027t mind.\" \n \n \"Try to get up, Jason,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \n \n Jason tried. \"I can\u0027t, Mrs. Jewls. I\u0027m stuck.\" \n \n Mrs. Jewls asked the three Erics to help. Eric Fry and Eric Ovens pulled Jason. Eric Bacon held the chair. \n \n \"Stop,\" cried Jason. \"You\u0027ll rip my pants.\" \n \n Rondi and Allison giggled. \n \n \"All right,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"Let\u0027s try ice water. That should freeze the gum and make it less sticky. I\u0027ll go get some from Miss Mush.\" \n \n Miss Mush was the lunch teacher at Wayside School. She had the remarkable ability to undercook a dish andovercook it at the same time. \n 49Her specialty was a nice, hot bowl of mud. She called it porridge. \n Jason looked at Rondi and Allison. \"No, Mrs. Jewls,\" he said. \"Don\u0027t leave me. Besides, Miss Mush\u0027s ice water is probably warm.\" \n \n \"Don\u0027t be silly, Jason,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"I\u0027m sure it will be at least as cold as her soups.\" \n \n Rondi and Allison leered at Jason. \n \n \"No, Mrs. Jewls, don\u0027t go!\" begged Jason. \n \n \"I\u0027ll be right back, Jason,\" said Mrs. Jewls. She went to Miss Mush for some ice water. \n \n As soon as Mrs. Jewls stepped out the door, Rondi and Allison jumped up from their seats and started to tickle Jason. He laughed until his hair turned purple. The girls got back to their seats just as Mrs. Jewls returned. \n \n Mrs. Jewls carried a big bucket of ice cold water. \n \n \"Oh, no, please don\u0027t, no!\" Jason pleaded. \n \n \"We have no choice,\" said Mrs. Jewls. She threw the water all over him. \n \n \"Well,\" said Mrs. Jewls, \"try to get up.\" \n \n Jason was drenched. \"I\u0027m wet and I\u0027m cold and I\u0027m still stuck!\" \n \n \"Oh, well, it didn\u0027t work,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"At least we tried. Now I guess we\u0027ll have to cut your pants off.\" \n \n Rondi and Allison giggled. \n \n \"No, Mrs. Jewls, no!\" Jason screamed. \"I don\u0027t mind being stuck here. I\u0027m really very comfortable.\" \n \n \"Don\u0027t be silly, Jason,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \n \n \"Don\u0027t cut off my pants,\" said Jason. \n \n \"The three Erics can carry you to the bathroom,\"said Mrs. Jewls. \n 50\"I\u0027ll ask Louis to call your mother. She can bring you a new pair of pants.\" \n The three Erics took hold of Jason\u0027s chair and turned him upside down. \n \n \"No, Mrs. Jewls,\" said Jason. \"Now I\u0027ll always have a place to sit down. I won\u0027t have to worry about finding a seat on the bus.\" \n \n The three Erics began to take him away. \n \n \"Wait,\" said Joy. \"Mrs. Jewls, if I can get Jason unstuck, do I still have to go home on the kindergarten bus?\" \n \n \"All right,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"If you can somehow get Jason free, you don\u0027t have to go home early.\" \n \n \"Don\u0027t trust her, Mrs. Jewls,\" said Jason. He was still hanging upside down. \n \n \"I\u0027ll just kiss him,\" said Joy. \n \n \"No!\" Jason screamed. \"Don\u0027t let her kiss me, Mrs. Jewls. Throw water on me. Tickle me. Cut off my pants. Hang me upside down from the ceiling. But don\u0027t let her kiss me!\" \n \n \"I\u0027ll just kiss him on the nose,\" said Joy. \n \n \"We\u0027ve got nothing to lose, Jason,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \n \n \"Oooooh, who would want to kiss Jason!\" said Allison. \n \n Jason hung helplessly upside down. \n \n Joy stepped up and kissed him on the nose. \n \n Jason fell out of the chair and hit his head on the floor. \n \n Rondi and Allison giggled. \n \n \"Darn,\" said Todd. \"Now I\u0027ll have to go home alone again.\" \n \n Joy erased her name from the blackboard. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1988/56819.html","bookId":627,"book":{"id":627,"title":"歪歪小学的荒诞故事 Sideways Stories from Wayside School","description":"简介： 当路易斯．萨奇尔还是学生时，他的老师们总是念错他的名字。现在，他变成有名的童书作家，不同地方的老师还是念错他的名字。在他们家族，这个姓氏的发音是萨「克」尔，但事实上这个字正统的发音为萨「奇」尔，你说怪不怪。三十层楼的教室里，有个很坏的老师，你不乖，她...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201802/28/11-07-35-80-1.jpg","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1988","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM"}}
