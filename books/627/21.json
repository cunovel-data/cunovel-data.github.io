Jenny was playing hopscotch with Louis. Jenny was on nine. Louis was still on four, but it was his turn. \n 79\"I want to play kickball,\" Ron said. \n \"So, go play kickball,\" said Louis. \n \n \"Terrence won\u0027t let me play,\" said Ron. \n \n Louis walked with Ron to the kickball field. \n \n \"Hey, what about our hopscotch game?\" Jenny asked. \n \n \"You won,\" said Louis. \n \n \"I just beat Louis in hopscotch!\" Jenny announced. Leslie, Rondi, and Allison flocked around her. \n \n \"Hey, Louis,\" Dameon shouted. \"Do you want to play kickball?\" \n \n \"All right,\" said Louis. \"Ron and I will both play.\" \n \n \"No,\" said Terrence. \"Ron isn\u0027t playing.\" \n \n \"Anyone who wants to play can play,\" said Louis. \n \n \"No, he can\u0027t,\" said Terrence. \"It\u0027s my ball.\" \n \n \"It isn\u0027t your ball,\" said Louis. \n \n \"You gave it to me,\" said Terrence. \n \n \"I gave it to you to share,\" said Louis. \"If you can\u0027t share it, you can\u0027t have it.\" \n \n \"Oh, all right,\" said Terrence. \"But I get to pitch.\" \n \n \"Ron and I will stand everybody!\" Louis announced. \n \n \"All right!\" said Jason. \"We\u0027ll kill them!\" \n \n \"We\u0027ll murder them!\" said Deedee. \n \n \"We\u0027ll smash them!\" said Myron. \n \n \"We\u0027ll see,\" said Louis. \n \n Ron pitched, and Louis played the other eight positions. Twenty minutes later, they finally got three outs. The score was twenty-one to nothing. \n \n Ron was up first. \n \n \"Infield in!\" shouted Dameon. Everybody stood within ten feet of home plate. \n 80\"All right, Ron,\" Louis shouted, \"kick it over their heads!\" \n Ron kicked the ball only three-and-a-half feet. Todd picked it up and threw him out. \n \n Louis was up. Everybody ran back to the edge of the outfield. Still, Louis kicked the ball over their heads for a home run. \n \n Everybody ran all the way back in again for Ron\u0027s up. He kicked the ball only two feet. Deedee tagged him out. \n \n Louis kicked another home run. \n \n Ron then kicked the ball a foot and tripped over it on his way to first base. Three outs. \n \n Ron and Louis held the other team to only five runs the next inning. That was because the bell rang. Lunch was finally over. \n \n Louis and Ron lost twenty-six to two. Ron had had a wonderful time. \n \n The next day Ron said, \"I want to play kickball.\" \n \n \"You can\u0027t play,\" said Terrence. \n \n \"Get out of here,\" said Jason. \n \n \"Scram,\" said Deedee. \n \n \"I want to play kickball,\" Ron told Louis. \n \n Louis walked with him to the kickball field. \"Ron and I will stand all of you.\" \n \n Everybody liked the teams. \n \n Ron pitched while Louis played the other eight positions. They lost fifty-seven to two. \n \n After the game Louis took Ron aside. \"Listen. Ron,\" he said, \"why do you always want to play kickball? You can\u0027t kick. You can\u0027t field. You can\u0027t even run to first base. You just get smashed every game.\" \n 81\"Hey, now wait a second,\" said Ron. \"Don\u0027t go blaming it all on me. You\u0027re half the team, too, you know.\" And with that, he punched Louis in the stomach. \n And he punched a heck of a lot harder than he kicked. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1988/56827.html","bookId":627,"book":{"id":627,"title":"歪歪小学的荒诞故事 Sideways Stories from Wayside School","description":"简介： 当路易斯．萨奇尔还是学生时，他的老师们总是念错他的名字。现在，他变成有名的童书作家，不同地方的老师还是念错他的名字。在他们家族，这个姓氏的发音是萨「克」尔，但事实上这个字正统的发音为萨「奇」尔，你说怪不怪。三十层楼的教室里，有个很坏的老师，你不乖，她...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201802/28/11-07-35-80-1.jpg","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1988","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM"}}
