When all of the other children went to recess, Mrs. Jewls told Joe to wait inside. \"Joe,\" she said. \"How much hair do you have?\" Joe shrugged his shoulders. \"A lot,\" he answered. \"But how much, Joe?\" asked Mrs. Jewls. \"Enough to cover my head,\" Joe answered. \"Joe, you are going to have to learn how to count,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"But, Mrs. Jewls, I already know how to count,\" said Joe. \"Let me go to recess.\" \"First count to ten,\" said Mrs. Jewls. Joe counted to ten: \"six, eight, twelve, one, five, two, seven, eleven, three, ten.\" \"No, Joe, that is wrong,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"No, it isn\u0027t,\" said Joe. \"I counted until I got to ten.\" \"But you were wrong,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"I\u0027ll prove it to you.\" She put five pencils on his desk. \"How many pencils do we have here, Joe?\" Joe counted the pencils. \"Four, six, one, nine, five. There are five pencils, Mrs. Jewls.\" \"That\u0027s wrong,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"How many pencils are there?\" Joe asked. \"Five,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"That\u0027s what I said,\" said Joe. \"May I go to recess now?\" \"No,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"You got the right answer, but you counted the wrong way. You were just lucky.\" She set eight potatoes on his desk. \"How many potatoes, Joe?\" Joe counted the potatoes. \"Seven, five, three, one, two, four, six, eight. There are eight potatoes, Mrs. Jewls.\" \"No, there are eight,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"But that\u0027s what I said,\" said Joe. \"May I go to recess now?\" \"No, you got the right answer, but you counted the wrong way again.\" She put three books on his desk. \"Count the books, Joe.\" Joe counted the books. \"A thousand, a million, three. Three, Mrs. Jewls.\" \"Correct,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"May I go to recess now?\" Joe asked. \"No,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"May I have a potato?\" asked Joe. \"No. Listen to me. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"Now you say it.\" \"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,\" said Joe. \"Very good!\" said Mrs. Jewls. She put six erasers on his desk. \"Now count the erasers, Joe, just the way I showed you.\" Joe counted the erasers. \"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. There are ten, Mrs. Jewls.\" \"No,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"Didn\u0027t I count right?\" asked Joe. \"Yes, you counted right, but you got the wrong answer,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"This doesn\u0027t make any sense,\" said Joe. \"When I count the wrong way I get the right answer, and when I count right I get the wrong answer.\" Mrs. Jewls hit her head against the wall five times. \"How many times did I hit my head against the wall?\" she asked. \"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. You hit your head against the wall ten times,\" said Joe. \"No,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"Four, six, one, nine, five. You hit your head five times,\" said Joe. Mrs. Jewls shook her head no and said, \"Yes, that is right.\" The bell rang, and all the other children came back from recess. The fresh air had made them very excited, and they were laughing and shouting. \"Oh, darn,\" said Joe. \"Now I missed recess.\" \"Hey, Joe, where were you?\" asked John. \"You missed a great game of kickball.\" \"I kicked a home run,\" said Todd. \"What was wrong with you, Joe?\" asked Joy. \"Nothing,\" said Joe. \"Mrs. Jewls was just trying to teach me how to count.\" Joy laughed. \"You mean you don\u0027t know how to count!\" \"Counting is easy,\" said Maurecia. \"Now, now,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"What\u0027s easy for you may not be easy for Joe, and what\u0027s easy for Joe may not be easy for you.\" \"Nothing\u0027s easy for Joe,\" said Maurecia. \"He\u0027s stupid.\" \"I can beat you up,\" said Joe. \"Try it,\" said Maurecia. \"That will be enough of that,\" said Mrs. Jewls. She wrote Maurecia\u0027s name on the blackboard under the word DISCIPLINE. Joe put his head on his desk between the eight potatoes and the six erasers. \"Don\u0027t feel bad, Joe,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"I just don\u0027t get it,\" said Joe. \"I\u0027ll never learn how to count.\" \"Sure you will, Joe,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"One day itwill just come to you. You\u0027ll wake up one morning and suddenly be able to count.\" Joe asked, \"If all I have to do is wake up, what am I going to school for?\" \"School just speeds things up,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"Without school it might take another seventy years before you wake up and are able to count.\" \"By that time I may have no hair left on top of my head to count,\" said Joe. \"Exactly,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"That is why you go to school.\" When Joe woke up the next day, he knew how to count. He had fifty-five thousand and six hairs on his head. They were all curly.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1988/56810.html","bookId":627,"book":{"id":627,"title":"歪歪小学的荒诞故事 Sideways Stories from Wayside School","description":"简介： 当路易斯．萨奇尔还是学生时，他的老师们总是念错他的名字。现在，他变成有名的童书作家，不同地方的老师还是念错他的名字。在他们家族，这个姓氏的发音是萨「克」尔，但事实上这个字正统的发音为萨「奇」尔，你说怪不怪。三十层楼的教室里，有个很坏的老师，你不乖，她...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201802/28/11-07-35-80-1.jpg","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1988","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM"}}
