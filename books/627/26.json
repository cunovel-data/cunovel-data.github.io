{"id":19230,"no":26,"title":"Chapter 25","content":"Terrence was a good athlete but a bad sport. Rondi and Allison were playing two-square with a red ball. \"Can I play?\" asked Terrence. \"No,\" Allison replied. \"You have to let me play,\" Terrence said. \"Louis says we have to share the balls.\" \"Well, we\u0027re not sharing with you,\" said Allison. \"Oh, let him play,\" said Rondi. \"All right,\" said Allison. \"We\u0027ll play three-square. You better play right.\" 99\"I will,\" said Terrence. Allison bounced the ball to Rondi. Rondi bounced it over to Terrence. Terrence caught it and kicked it over the fence. \"You have to go get it,\" said Allison. \"Shut up, Dixie cup,\" Terrence answered. Rondi ran and told Louis. D.J. and Dameon were playing basketball. \"Uh-oh, here comes Terrence,\" said Dameon. \"Hey, let me play,\" said Terrence. \"Get lost, Terrence,\" said Dameon. \"You have to share the balls. Louis says so,\" said Terrence. \"Okay, but just throw it in the basket. Don\u0027t kick it,\" said Dameon. \"I won\u0027t,\" said Terrence. First Dameon took a shot. It bounced off the backboard and through the hoop. Next D.J. took a shot. He threw it underhand, way up in the air. It came down through the hoop without touching the rim. Then Terrence took a shot. He kicked it over the fence. \"You idiot,\" said Dameon. \"Take a train, peanut brain,\" Terrence answered. D.J. went and told Louis. Stephen, Calvin, Joe, John, and Leslie were playing spud. Stephen was IT. Everyone else had a number. Stephen had to throw the ball up in the air and call out a number. The person who had that number had to try to catch it. \"Can I play?\" asked Terrence. 100\"No,\" said Calvin. \"You\u0027ll just kick the ball over the fence.\" \"No,\" said Joe. \"No way,\" said John. \"No,\" said Leslie. \"Sure,\" said Stephen. \"Newcomers are IT.\" He gave the ball to Terrence. \"Just throw the ball up in the air and call out a number between one and five.\" \"Okay,\" said Terrence. The children formed a circle around Terrence. \"A million,\" yelled Terrence as he kicked the ball over the fence. \"What did you do that for?\" asked Stephen. \"Eat a frog, warthog,\" said Terrence. Stephen ran and told Louis. Terrence looked around. There was nothing to do. There were no balls left. Louis walked up to him. He was followed by Allison, Rondi, Dameon, D.J., Stephen, Calvin, Joe, John, and Leslie. \"What\u0027s the matter, Terrence?\" asked Louis. \"There are no balls,\" said Terrence. \"Do you have a green ball?\" \"No,\" said Louis. \"All of my balls have mysteriously disappeared.\" \"Darn it,\" said Terrence. \"There is nothing left to kick.\" \"Nothing left to kick?\" asked Louis. \"Oh, I don\u0027t know about that. What do you think, Rondi? Is there anything left to kick?\" Rondi thought a minute. Then she smiled. 101She was missing her two front teeth. \"Yes, there is something left to kick,\" she said. \"Well, where is it?\" asked Terrence. \"Let me check with Allison,\" said Louis. \"Allison, is there anything left to kick?\" He winked at her. \"There sure is,\" said Allison. \"What, what?\" asked Terrence. \"How about you, Dameon?\" asked Louis. \"Can you think of anything?\" Dameon nodded his head yes. \"Well, what is it?\" asked Terrence. He couldn\u0027t wait. \"D.J., we got anything around here to kick?\" asked Louis. D.J. smiled. \"Yes, we do,\" he said. \"Give it to me. Give it to me,\" Terrence demanded. \"I don\u0027t know if I should,\" said Louis. \"What do you think, Calvin? Should I give it to him?\" \"I think you should,\" said Calvin. \"You heard Calvin,\" said Terrence. \"Give it to me. \"Not so fast,\" said Louis. \"Leslie, should I give it to him?\" \"Oh, yes, I think he deserves it,\" said Leslie. \"Give it to me. Give it to me,\" Terrence repeated. \"Do you also think he deserves it, Joe?\" asked Louis. \"Yes, I think so,\" said Joe. \"What about you, John?\" asked Louis. \"Definitely give it to him,\" John answered. \"Come on. Come on,\" said Terrence. \"Recess is almost over.\" 102\"We\u0027ll leave it up to Stephen,\" said Louis. \"Whatever he says goes.\" \"Let him have it,\" said Stephen. \"You heard him, Louis,\" said Terrence. \"Let me have it.\" \"Okay,\" said Louis. He picked Terrence up and kicked him over the fence.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1988/56832.html","bookId":627,"book":{"id":627,"title":"歪歪小学的荒诞故事 Sideways Stories from Wayside School","description":"简介： 当路易斯．萨奇尔还是学生时，他的老师们总是念错他的名字。现在，他变成有名的童书作家，不同地方的老师还是念错他的名字。在他们家族，这个姓氏的发音是萨「克」尔，但事实上这个字正统的发音为萨「奇」尔，你说怪不怪。三十层楼的教室里，有个很坏的老师，你不乖，她...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201802/28/11-07-35-80-1.jpg","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1988","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM"}}
