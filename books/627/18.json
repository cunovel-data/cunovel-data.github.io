{"id":19222,"no":18,"title":"Chapter 17","content":"John had light brown hair and a round head. He was Joe\u0027s best friend. John was one of the smartest boys in Mrs. Jewls\u0027s class. But he had one problem. He could only read words written upside down. \n \n Nobody ever wrote anything upside down. \n \n But it was only a little problem. John was still in the high reading group. He just turned his book upside down. \n \n It was easier for John to turn his book upside down than to learn to read correctly. But the easiest way isn\u0027t always the best way. \n 68Mrs. Jewls said, \"John, you can\u0027t go on reading like this. You can\u0027t spend the rest of your life turning your books upside down.\" \n \"Why not?\" asked John. \n \n \"Because I said so,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"Besides, what happens when I write something on the blackboard? You can\u0027t turn the blackboard upside down.\" \n \n \"No, I guess you\u0027re right,\" said John. \n \n \"I know I\u0027m right,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"You are going to have to learn to stand on your head.\" \n \n John couldn\u0027t stand on his head. He had given up trying. You would have, too, if you had fallen over as many times as he had. \n \n Joe was John\u0027s best friend. He could stand on John\u0027s head. Every time John fell over, Joe stood on his head. After all, what are best friends for? \n \n \"My head is too round, Mrs. Jewls. I can\u0027t stand on it,\" said John. \n \n \"Of course you can, John,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"If Joe can stand on your head, so can you.\" \n \n \"It\u0027s easy, John,\" said Joe. \n \n \"I can\u0027t,\" John repeated. \"I always fall over.\" \n \n \"Nonsense,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"All you have to do is find your center of balance. Now, up you go.\" \n \n John put his round head on the floor and swung his legs up. He fell right over. Then Joe stood on John\u0027s head. \n \n \"See, John, it\u0027s easy. Nothing to it,\" Joe said. \n \n \"We\u0027ll help you, John,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"Joe, get off John\u0027s head and get me the pillow from under my desk. Nancy, Calvin, come here and give us a hand.\" \n \n Mrs. Jewls took the pillow from Joe and set it on thefloor. \n 69\"All right, John, we\u0027ll surround you,\" she said. \n \"We won\u0027t let you fall.\" \n \n John put his head on the pillow and swung his legs \n \n up. He started to fall one way, but Nancy pushed him \n \n back up. Then he started to fall another way, but Calvin \n \n straightened him out. John kept falling a little bit this \n \n way and that way until at last he found his center of \n \n balance. \n \n [Validator\u0027s note: the text that follows was printed upside-down in the original book. \n \n \"Hey, look at me. Look at me,\" said John. \"I\u0027m up. I\u0027m really up. I\u0027m standing on my head. I found my center of balance. It\u0027s beautiful. I can read the black-board! Hey Calvin, bring me a book, and you don\u0027t have to turn it upside down. Ha Ha. Hey, who, aaaaahhh????.\"] \n \n BAMM!! While Calvin went to get the book, John fell flat on his face. \n \n \"You better stay off my head, Joe,\" he warned. \n \n \"Are you all right, John?\" asked Mrs. Jewls. \n \n \"Yes, I think so. I feel a little funny. Hey! I can still read the blackboard, and I\u0027m not upside down. I can read right side up now. When I fell, I must have flipped my brain or something.\" \n \n \"That is wonderful, John,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"Here, put the pillow back under my desk. As a reward you may have a Tootsie Roll pop. They are in the coffee can on top of my desk.\" \n \n John placed the pillow on top of her desk. Then he looked under the desk, but he couldn\u0027t find the Tootsie Roll pops anywhere. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1988/56824.html","bookId":627,"book":{"id":627,"title":"歪歪小学的荒诞故事 Sideways Stories from Wayside School","description":"简介： 当路易斯．萨奇尔还是学生时，他的老师们总是念错他的名字。现在，他变成有名的童书作家，不同地方的老师还是念错他的名字。在他们家族，这个姓氏的发音是萨「克」尔，但事实上这个字正统的发音为萨「奇」尔，你说怪不怪。三十层楼的教室里，有个很坏的老师，你不乖，她...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201802/28/11-07-35-80-1.jpg","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1988","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM"}}
