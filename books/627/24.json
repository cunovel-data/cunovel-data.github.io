{"id":19228,"no":24,"title":"Chapter 23","content":"Dameon had hazel eyes with a little black dot in the middle of each of them. The dots were called pupils. So was Dameon. He was a pupil in Mrs. Jewls\u0027s class. Mrs. Jewls was about to show the class a movie. She turned out the lights. When it was dark, Dameon\u0027s pupils got bigger. \"Dameon,\" said Mrs. Jewls, \"run downstairs and ask Louis if he\u0027d like to see the movie with us.\" Dameon ran down the thirty flights of stairs to the playground. He stepped outside as Louis was hooking up a tetherball. 90\"Hey, Louis,\" Dameon called. \"Do you want to see a movie in Mrs. Jewls\u0027s class?\" Louis rubbed his chin. \"What movie?\" he asked. Dameon shrugged his shoulders. \"I don\u0027t know,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll be right back.\" Dameon ran all the way back up the stairs to the thirtieth story. \"Louis wants to know, what movie?\" said Dameon. \"Does he want to know the name of the movie or what the movie is about?\" asked Mrs. Jewls. \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Dameon. \"I\u0027ll ask him.\" Dameon raced back down the stairs and out to the playground. \"Louis, do you want to know the name of the movie or what the movie is about?\" he asked. \"The name,\" said Louis. \"Okay,\" said Dameon. Dameon hurried back up the thirty flights of stairs. He took the steps two at a time. \"He wants to know the name,\" said Dameon. \"Turtles,\"said Mrs. Jewls. Dameon turned around, took a deep breath, then ran back down the stairs. \"Turtles,\u0027\u0027Dameon told Louis. \"Hey, that might be good,\" said Louis. \"What\u0027s it about?\" \"I\u0027m not sure,\" said Dameon. \"I\u0027ll find out.\" Dameon raced back up the stairs. But first he stopped to take a drink of water. \"What\u0027s it about, Mrs. Jewls?\" asked Dameon. \"Turtles,\" said Mrs. Jewls. Dameon rushed back down the stairs to tell Louis. 91\"Turtles,\" said Dameon. \"No, thanks,\" said Louis. \"I don\u0027t like turtles. They are too slow.\" Dameon lowered his head and slowly walked up the thirty flights of stairs. His legs were sore, he could hardly breathe, and his side ached. By the time he got to Mrs. Jewls\u0027s class, the movie was over. \"All right, class,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"I want everybody to take out a piece of paper and a pencil and write something about turtles.\" Dameon had missed the movie, but he still could have written something about turtles: \"Turtles are too slow.\" But now he couldn\u0027t find his pencil. It just wasn\u0027t his day. \"What\u0027s the matter, Dameon?\" asked Mrs. Jewls. \"I can\u0027t find my pencil,\" said Dameon. \"Class, Dameon\u0027s pencil is missing,\" Mrs. Jewls announced. \"What did it look like, Dameon?\" she asked. \"It was long and yellow,\" said Dameon. \"It had a black point at one end and a red eraser at the other.\" \"I found it,\" said Todd, \"here, by the blackboard.\" \"Yes, that\u0027s it,\" said Dameon. \"No, there it is, in the corner by the waste basket,\" said \"Crabapple.\" \"Hmmm, maybe that\u0027s it,\" said Dameon. \"Here it is,\" said John. \"It\u0027s been in my desk the whole time.\" \"No, here it is in my hand,\" said Joe. \"I found it,\" said Rondi. \"Here it is,\" said Allison. \"I have it,\" laughed D.J. 92\"I found it,\" said Myron. \"Which one is yours, Dameon?\" asked Mrs. Jewls. Dameon studied each pencil. \"They all look like mine,\" he said. Fortunately, at that moment, Louis walked into the classroom. He handed Dameon a pencil. \"You dropped this when you were telling me about the movie,\" said Louis. \"Thanks,\" said Dameon. \"Okay, class,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"So that we have no more mix-ups, I want everybody to write his name on his pencil.\" Dameon spent the rest of the day trying to write his name on his pencil. Dameon\u0027s pencil couldn\u0027t write on itself. It was just like his beautiful hazel eyes with the black dots in the middle. They could see everything except themselves.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1988/56830.html","bookId":627,"book":{"id":627,"title":"歪歪小学的荒诞故事 Sideways Stories from Wayside School","description":"简介： 当路易斯．萨奇尔还是学生时，他的老师们总是念错他的名字。现在，他变成有名的童书作家，不同地方的老师还是念错他的名字。在他们家族，这个姓氏的发音是萨「克」尔，但事实上这个字正统的发音为萨「奇」尔，你说怪不怪。三十层楼的教室里，有个很坏的老师，你不乖，她...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201802/28/11-07-35-80-1.jpg","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1988","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM"}}
