{"id":19216,"no":12,"title":"Chapter 11","content":"Dana had four beautiful eyes. She wore glasses. But her eyes were so beautiful that the glasses only made her prettier. With two eyes she was pretty. With four eyes she was beautiful. With six eyes she would have been even more beautiful. And if she had a hundred eyes, all over her face and her arms and her feet, why, she would have been the most beautiful creature in the world. But poor Dana wasn\u0027t covered from head to foot with beautiful eyes. She was covered with mosquito bites. Mrs. Jewls picked up her yardstick and said, \"Now it\u0027s time for arithmetic.\" 44\"Oh, no, Mrs. Jewls,\" said Dana. \"I can\u0027t do arithmetic. I itch all over. I can\u0027t concentrate.\" \"But we have all kinds of arithmetic,\" said Mrs. Jewls, \"addition without carrying, addition with carrying, and carrying without addition.\" \"I don\u0027t care,\" cried Dana. \"We have that, too,\" said Mrs. Jewls, \"addition without caring. Now, stop carrying on.\" Dana whined, \"I can\u0027t, Mrs. Jewls. I itch too much.\" \"And I\u0027m too thirsty,\" said D.J. \"I\u0027m too tired,\" said Ron. \"I\u0027m too hungry,\" said Terrence. \"I\u0027m too stupid,\" said Todd. Mrs. Jewls hit her desk with her yardstick. Everyone stopped talking. Mrs. Jewls said, \"We are going to have arithmetic now, and I don\u0027t want to hear another thing about it.\" \"But, Mrs. Jewls, I really do itch. I can\u0027t do arithmetic,\" Dana whined. \"No,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"Arithmetic is the best known cure for an itch. How many mosquito bites do you have?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Dana, \"over a hundred. First I try scratching one, but then another one starts to itch. So I scratch that one, and that one stops, and another one starts. So I scratch that one, and the itch moves down to another one. Then it goes back to the first one. The itch just never stays in the same place. I just can\u0027t scratch them all.\" \"What you need is a good, strong dose of arithmetic,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"I\u0027d rather have calamine lotion,\" said Dana. 45\"Remember, Dana,\" said Mrs. Jewls, \"mosquito bites itch, not numbers.\" \"So what?\" said Dana. Mrs. Jewls continued. \"We\u0027ll just have to turn your mosquito bites into numbers.\" \"I\u0027m a mess,\" Dana moaned. Mrs. Jewls began to turn the mosquito bites into numbers. \"How much is three mosquito bites plus three mosquito bites?\" she asked. Rondi raised her hand. \"Six mosquito bites,\" she answered. \"How much is six mosquito bites minus two mosquito bites?\" asked Mrs. Jewls. \"Four mosquito bites,\" said D.J. \"How much is five mosquito bites times two?\" asked Mrs. Jewls. \"Ten mosquito bites,\" said Bebe. \"Very good,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"I still itch,\" Dana complained. \"I\u0027ve got one more question,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"How much is forty-nine mosquito bites plus seventy-five mosquito bites?\" Nobody raised a hand. \"Think, class,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"This is for Dana.\" Nobody knew the answer. Dana\u0027s itch began to get worse and worse. At last, Dana began counting her own mosquito bites. She counted seventy-five on one side and forty-nine on the other. Then she added them together for a total of one hundred and twenty-four mosquito bites. \"One hundred and twenty-four mosquito bites,\" Dana called. 46\"Very good,\" said Mrs. Jewls. Dana had one hundred and twenty-four mosquito bites. And none of them itched anymore. \"I\u0027m still thirsty,\" said D.J. \"Can arithmetic do anything for that?\" \"I\u0027m still tired,\" said Ron. \"I\u0027m still hungry,\" said Terrence. \"I\u0027m still stupid,\" said Todd. \"I\u0027m glad we turned my mosquito bites into numbers instead of letters,\" said Dana. \"I could never spellmosquito.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1988/56818.html","bookId":627,"book":{"id":627,"title":"歪歪小学的荒诞故事 Sideways Stories from Wayside School","description":"简介： 当路易斯．萨奇尔还是学生时，他的老师们总是念错他的名字。现在，他变成有名的童书作家，不同地方的老师还是念错他的名字。在他们家族，这个姓氏的发音是萨「克」尔，但事实上这个字正统的发音为萨「奇」尔，你说怪不怪。三十层楼的教室里，有个很坏的老师，你不乖，她...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201802/28/11-07-35-80-1.jpg","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1988","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM"}}
