{"id":19211,"no":7,"title":"Chapter 6","content":"Bebe was a girl with short brown hair, a little beebee nose, totally tiny toes, and big brown eyes. Her full name was Bebe Gunn. She was the fastest draw in Mrs. Jewls\u0027s class. \\n\\n \\n\\n She could draw a cat in less than forty-five seconds, a dog in less than thirty, and a flower in less than eight seconds. \\n\\n \\n\\n But, of course, Bebe never drew just one dog, or one cat, or one flower. Art was from twelve-thirty to one-thirty. Why, in that time, she could draw fifty cats, a hundred flowers, twenty dogs, and several eggs orwatermelons. \\n\\n 24It took her the same amount of time to draw a watermelon as an egg. \\n\\n Calvin sat next to Bebe. He didn\u0027t think he was very good at art. Why, it took him the whole period just to draw one airplane. So instead, he just helped Bebe. He was Bebe\u0027s assistant. As soon as Bebe would finish one masterpiece, Calvin would take it from her and set down a clean sheet of paper. Whenever her crayon ran low, Calvin was ready with a new crayon. That way Bebe didn\u0027t have to waste any time. And in return, Bebe would draw five or six airplanes for Calvin. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was twelve-thirty, time for art. Bebe was ready. On her desk was a sheet of yellow construction paper. In her hand was a green crayon. \\n\\n \\n\\n Calvin was ready. He held a stack of paper and a box of crayons. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ready, Bebe,\" said Calvin. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ready, Calvin,\" said Bebe. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Okay,\" said Mrs. Jewls, \"time for art.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She had hardly finished her sentence when Bebe had already drawn a picture of a leaf. \\n\\n \\n\\n Calvin took it from her and put another piece of paper down. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Red,\" called Bebe. \\n\\n \\n\\n Calvin handed Bebe a red crayon. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Blue,\" called Bebe. \\n\\n \\n\\n He gave her a blue crayon. \\n\\n \\n\\n They were quite a pair. Their teamwork was remarkable. Bebe drew pictures as fast as Calvin could pick up the old paper and set down the new-a fish, an apple, three cherries, bing, bing, bing. \\n\\n 25At one-thirty Mrs. Jewls announced, \"Okay, class, art is over.\" \\n\\n Bebe dropped her crayon and fell over on her desk. Calvin sighed and leaned back in his chair. He could hardly move. They had broken their old record. Bebe had drawn three hundred and seventy-eight pictures. They lay in a pile on Calvin\u0027s desk. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Jewls walked by. \"Calvin, did you draw all these pictures?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Calvin laughed. \"No, I can\u0027t draw. Bebe drew them all.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, then, what did you draw?\" asked Mrs. Jewls. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t draw anything,\" said Calvin. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why not? Don\u0027t you like art?\" asked Mrs. Jewls. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I love art,\" said Calvin. \"That\u0027s why I didn\u0027t draw anything.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Jewls did not understand. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It would have taken me the whole period just to draw one picture,\" said Calvin. \"And Bebe would only have been able to draw a hundred pictures. But with the two of us working together, she was able to draw three hundred and seventy-eight pictures! That\u0027s a lot more art.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Bebe and Calvin shook hands. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"That isn\u0027t how you measure art. It isn\u0027t how many pictures you have, but how good the pictures are. Why, a person could spend his whole life just drawing one picture of a cat. In that time I\u0027m sure Bebe could draw a million cats.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Two million,\" said Bebe. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Jewls continued. \"But if that one picture is better than each of Bebe\u0027s two million, then that person has produced more art than Bebe.\" \\n\\n 26Bebe looked as if she was going to cry. She picked up all the pictures from Calvin\u0027s desk and threw them in the garbage. Then she ran from the room. \\n\\n \"I thought her pictures were good,\" said Calvin. He reached into the garbage pail and took out a crumpled-up picture of an airplane. \\n\\n \\n\\n Bebe walked outside into the playground. \\n\\n \\n\\n Louis, the yard teacher, spotted her. \"Where are you going?\" he asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m going home to draw a picture of a cat,\" said Bebe. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Will you bring it to school and show it to me tomorrow?\" Louis asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Tomorrow!\" laughed Bebe. \"By tomorrow I doubt if I\u0027ll even be finished with one whisker.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1988/56813.html","bookId":627,"book":{"id":627,"title":"歪歪小学的荒诞故事 Sideways Stories from Wayside School","description":"简介： 当路易斯．萨奇尔还是学生时，他的老师们总是念错他的名字。现在，他变成有名的童书作家，不同地方的老师还是念错他的名字。在他们家族，这个姓氏的发音是萨「克」尔，但事实上这个字正统的发音为萨「奇」尔，你说怪不怪。三十层楼的教室里，有个很坏的老师，你不乖，她...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201802/28/11-07-35-80-1.jpg","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1988","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM"}}
