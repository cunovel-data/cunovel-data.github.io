{"id":19233,"no":29,"title":"Chapter 28","content":"Stephen had green hair. He had purple ears and a blue face. He wore his sister\u0027s pink dancing shoes and green leotards. The leotards matched his hair. He was all dressed up as a goblin for Mrs. Jewls\u0027s Halloween party. \\n\\n \\n\\n But unfortunately it wasn\u0027t Halloween. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ha, ha, ha, you sure look stupid,\" said Jason. Jason was Stephen\u0027s best friend. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"So do you,\" said Stephen. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Boy, are you dumb,\" said Jenny. \"Halloween is on Sunday. Today is only Friday.\" \\n\\n 112\"You\u0027re the one who\u0027s dumb,\" said Stephen. \"Ha, ha, you\u0027d probably come to school on Sunday. Mrs. Jewls said we\u0027d have the party today.\" \\n\\n But none of the other children wore costumes, only Stephen. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All right, class,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"It is time for our Halloween party.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"See,\" said Stephen. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Jewls gave each child a cookie that looked like an orange witch with a black hat. She laughed when she saw Stephen and forgot to give him one. Stephen didn\u0027t ask for it. He was afraid that she\u0027d laugh again. \\n\\n \\n\\n The children finished their cookies in less than thirty seconds. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All right, class,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"The party is over. We have a lot of work to do.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Stephen felt like a fool. The party lasted less than a minute. And he had to spend the rest of the day wearing his stupid goblin suit. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Look, Stephen\u0027s wearing his sister\u0027s leotards,\" laughed Dana. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They\u0027re green, just like his hair,\" said \"Fatso.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Everybody laughed. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Jewls began the arithmetic lesson. She wrote on the blackboard. \"Two plus two equals five.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s wrong!\" Joy shouted. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Jewls tried again. \"Two plus two equals three.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n That wasn\u0027t right, either. She added two and two again and got forty-three. It was useless. No matter how hard she tried, she could not get two plus two to equal four. \\n\\n 113\"I don\u0027t understand it,\" she said. \"They\u0027ve always equaled four before.\" \\n\\n Suddenly she screamed. The chalk turned into a squiggling worm! She dropped it on her foot. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then all the lights went out, and the blackboard lit up like a movie screen. \\n\\n \\n\\n A woman appeared on the screen. She had a long tongue and pointed ears. She stepped off the screen and into the classroom. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was the ghost of Mrs. Gorf. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Gorf ran her fingernails across the blackboard. \"Trick or treat, you rotten kids,\" she said. \"Now I\u0027ll get even with every last one of you. Where\u0027s Todd?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Who is that?\" asked Mrs. Jewls. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mrs. Gorf,\" said Dameon. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Who\u0027s Mrs. Gorf?\" asked Mrs. Jewls. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She was the meanest teacher we ever had,\" said Rondi. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What happened to her?\" asked Mrs. Jewls. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Louis ate her,\" said Jason. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, I\u0027m not going to allow this,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"Get out of my classroom!\" she demanded. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s Halloween, sweet teacher,\" said Mrs. Gorf. \"Ghosts can go anywhere they like. I\u0027ve come for a little class reunion.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But it isn\u0027t Halloween,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"Halloween is still two days away.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I know,\" said Mrs. Gorf, \"but Halloween falls on a Sunday this year, so we are celebrating it on the Friday before.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Stephen leaped up from his seat. \"See, I was right,\"he said. \\n\\n 114\"Today is the day we celebrate it, the Friday before! Mrs. Gorf proved it.\" \\n\\n He ran up to Mrs. Gorf. \"They all laughed at me and made me feel stupid because I was the only one who got dressed up. But they were the ones who were wrong. You and I are right.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He put his arms around Mrs. Gorf and hugged her. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Gorf gasped and disappeared. \\n\\n \\n\\n The lights came back on. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Jewls picked up the piece of chalk from the floor. She wrote on the blackboard, \"Two plus two equals four.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s good,\" she said. \"When two plus two doesn\u0027t equal four, anything can happen.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n All the children who had laughed at Stephen now called him a hero. But they told him to change out of his stupid costume. \\n\\n \\n\\n So at lunch, Stephen went home, washed up, and changed. He came back wearing blue jeans and a polo shirt. Of course, his hair was still green. It always was. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1988/56835.html","bookId":627,"book":{"id":627,"title":"歪歪小学的荒诞故事 Sideways Stories from Wayside School","description":"简介： 当路易斯．萨奇尔还是学生时，他的老师们总是念错他的名字。现在，他变成有名的童书作家，不同地方的老师还是念错他的名字。在他们家族，这个姓氏的发音是萨「克」尔，但事实上这个字正统的发音为萨「奇」尔，你说怪不怪。三十层楼的教室里，有个很坏的老师，你不乖，她...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201802/28/11-07-35-80-1.jpg","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1988","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM"}}
