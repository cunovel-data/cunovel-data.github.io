{"id":19214,"no":10,"title":"Chapter 9","content":"Maurecia liked ice cream. She was sweet and pretty and could beat up any boy in Mrs. Jewls\u0027s class. Everybody liked Maurecia-except Kathy, but then she didn\u0027t like anybody. Maurecia only liked ice cream. \\n\\n \\n\\n Every day Maurecia brought an ice cream cone to school and kept it in her desk until lunch time. At first she brought chocolate ice cream every day. But she soon tired of chocolate ice cream. So she started bringing vanilla. But she got tired of vanilla, too. Then she got tired of strawberry, fudge ripple, butter pecan, pistachio, and burgundy cherry, in that order. \\n\\n 36And then a terrible thing happened. Maurecia got tired of ice cream. By that time her desk was a mess, and everything in it was sticky. \\n\\n Everybody liked Maurecia. But Maurecia didn\u0027t like anything. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Jewls hated to see Maurecia unhappy. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t understand it, Mrs. Jewls,\" cried Maurecia. \"There just aren\u0027t any good flavors anymore.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n So Mrs. Jewls worked all night. The next day she brought in a new flavor of ice cream for Maurecia. It was Maurecia-flavored ice cream. \"Everybody will like it,\" thought Mrs. Jewls, \"because everybody likes Maurecia.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Here you are, Maurecia,\" said Mrs. Jewls, \"Maurecia-flavored ice cream.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Everybody gathered around as Maurecia tasted it. They hoped she\u0027d like it. \\n\\n \\n\\n Maurecia took a lick. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well?\" said Mrs. Jewls. \\n\\n \\n\\n Maurecia took another lick. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well?\" asked the class. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"This ice cream has no taste,\" said Maurecia. \"It doesn\u0027t taste bad, but it doesn\u0027t taste good. It doesn\u0027t taste like anything at all!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Jewls was heartbroken. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Here, let me try it,\" said Todd. He tasted it. \"You\u0027re crazy, Maurecia!\" he said. \"This is the best-tasting ice cream I\u0027ve ever eaten! Try some, Deedee.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ummmmmmmmm, it\u0027s delicious,\" said Deedee. \"It\u0027s so sweet and creamy.\" She passed it around the room. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, it is so good,\" said Leslie. \\n\\n 37\"I think it tastes terrible,\" said Kathy. \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t understand it,\" said Maurecia. \"I don\u0027t taste a thing.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Jewls slapped herself in the face. \"Oh, I\u0027ve made a big mistake, Maurecia. Of course you can\u0027t taste anything. It\u0027s Maurecia-flavored ice cream. It\u0027s the same taste you always taste when you\u0027re not tasting anything at all.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n So the next day Mrs. Jewls brought in Joe-flavored ice cream. Maurecia liked it. So did everybody else. Joe thought it had no taste. \\n\\n \\n\\n Everybody liked Maurecia. Maurecia only liked Joe. \\n\\n \\n\\n The following day Mrs. Jewls brought in Ron-flavored ice cream. Ron thought it had no taste, but everybody else loved it. \\n\\n \\n\\n Everybody liked Maurecia. Maurecia only liked Joe and Ron. \\n\\n \\n\\n By the end of the month, Mrs. Jewls had brought in twenty-seven new flavors of ice cream, one for each member of the class. \\n\\n \\n\\n Everybody liked Maurecia, and Maurecia liked everybody. They all tasted so good. All except Kathy, that is. Kathy-flavored ice cream tasted a little bit like old bologna. \\n\\n \\n\\n Everyone still agreed that Maurecia-flavored ice cream was the best, except Maurecia. She liked Todd ice cream the best. \\n\\n \\n\\n This turned out to be a problem. Every once in a while Maurecia would try to take a bite out of Todd\u0027s arm in order to get that very special flavor. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1988/56816.html","bookId":627,"book":{"id":627,"title":"歪歪小学的荒诞故事 Sideways Stories from Wayside School","description":"简介： 当路易斯．萨奇尔还是学生时，他的老师们总是念错他的名字。现在，他变成有名的童书作家，不同地方的老师还是念错他的名字。在他们家族，这个姓氏的发音是萨「克」尔，但事实上这个字正统的发音为萨「奇」尔，你说怪不怪。三十层楼的教室里，有个很坏的老师，你不乖，她...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201802/28/11-07-35-80-1.jpg","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1988","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM"}}
