{"id":41761,"no":5,"title":"V CLIMATE AT THE FRONT","content":"If there is one man in France whom I do not envy it is the G.H.Q. Weather Prophet. I can picture the unfortunate wizard sitting in his bureau gazing into a crystal, Old Moore\u0027s Almanack in one hand, a piece of seaweed in the other, trying to guess what tricks the weather will be up to next. For there is nothing this climate cannot do. As a quick-change artist it stands sanspareil (French) and nulli secundus (Latin). And now it seems to have mislaid the Spring altogether. Summer has come at one stride. Yesterday the staff-cars smothered one with mud as they whirled past; to-day they choke one with dust. Yesterday the authorities were issuing precautions against frostbite; to-day they are issuing precautions against sunstroke. Nevertheless we are not complaining. It will take a lot of sunshine to kill us; we like it, and we don\u0027t mind saying so. The B.E.F. has cast from it its mitts and jerkins and whale-oil, emerged from its subterranean burrows into the open, and in every wood a mushroom town of bivouacs has sprung up over-night. Here and there amateur gardeners have planted flower-beds before their tents; one of my corporals is nursing some radishes in an ammunition box and talks crop prospects by the hour. My troop-sergeant found two palm plants in the ruins of a chateau glass-house, and now has them standing sentry at his bivouac entrance. He sits between them after evening stables, smoking his pipe and fancying himself back in Zanzibar; he expects the coker-nuts along about August, he tells me. Summer has come, and on every slope graze herds of winter-worn gun horses and transport mules. The new grass has gone to the heads of the latter and they make continuous exhibitions of themselves, gambolling about like ungainly lambkins and roaring with unholy laughter. Summer has come, and my groom and countryman has started to whistle again, sure sign that Winter is over, for it is only during the Summer that he reconciles himself to the War. War, he admits, serves very well as a light gentlemanly diversion for the idle months, but with the first yellow leaf he grows restless and hints indirectly that both ourselves and the horses would be much better employed in the really serious business of showing the little foxes some sport back in our own green isle. \"That Paddy,\" says he, slapping the bay with a hay wisp, \"he wishes he was back in the county Kildare, he does so, the dear knows. Pegeen, too, if she would be hearin\u0027 the houn\u0027s shoutin\u0027 out on her from the kennels beyond in Jigginstown she\u0027d dhrop down dead wid the pleasure wid\u0027in her, an\u0027 that\u0027s the thrue word,\" says he, presenting the chestnut lady with a grimy army biscuit. \"Och musha, the poor foolish cratures,\" he says and sighs. However, Summer has arrived, and by the sound of his cheery whistle at early stables shrilling \"Flannigan\u0027s Wedding,\" I understand that the horses are settling down once more and we can proceed with the battle. If my groom and countryman is not an advocate of war as a winter sport, our Mr. Mactavish, on the other hand, is of the directly opposite opinion. \"War,\" he murmured dreamily to me yesterday as we lay on our backs beneath a spreading parasol of apple-blossom and watched our troop-horses making pigs of themselves in the young clover—\"war! don\u0027t mention the word to me. Maidenhead, Canader, cushions, cigarettes, only girl in the world doing all the heavy paddle-work—that\u0027s the game in the good ole summer-time. Call round again about October and I\u0027ll attend to your old war.\" It is fortunate that these gentlemen do not adorn any higher positions than those of private soldier and second lieutenant, else, between them, they would stop the War altogether and we should all be out of jobs.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3294/90080.html","bookId":457,"book":{"id":457,"title":"The Mudlarks","description":"简介： When I was young, my parents sent me to a boarding school, not in any hopes of getting me educated, but because they wanted a quiet home....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3294","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:47 AM"}}
