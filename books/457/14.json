{"id":41770,"no":14,"title":"XIV \"HARMONY, GENTS!\"","content":"No one, with the exception of the Boche, has a higher admiration for the scrapping abilities of the Scot than I have, but in matters musical we do not hear ear to ear. It is not that I have no soul; I have. I fairly throb with it. I rise in the mornings trilling trifles of Monckton and croon myself to sleep o\u0027 nights with snatches of Novello. I do not wish to boast, but to hear me pick the \"Moonlight Sonata\" out of a piano with one hand (the other strapped behind my back) is an unforgettable experience. I would not yield to Paderewski himself on the comb, bones or Jew\u0027s harp, and I could give A. Gabriel a run for his money on the coachhorn. But these bagpipes! It is not so much the execution of the bagpiper that I object to as his restricted repertoire. He can only play one noise. It is quite useless a Scot explaining to me that this is the \"Lament of Sandy Macpherson\" and that the \"Dirge of Hamish MacNish\"; it all sounds the same to me. The brigade of infantry that is camped in front of my dug-out (\"Mon Repos\") is a Scots brigade. Not temporary Scots from the Highlands of Commissioner Street, Jo\u0027burg, and Hastings Street, Vancouver (about whom I have nothing to say), but real pukka, law-abiding, kirk-going, God-fearing, bayonet-pushing Gaels, bred among the crags of the Grampians and reared on thistles and illicit whuskey. And every second man in this brigade is a confirmed bagpiper. They have massed pipes for breakfast, lunch, tea and dinner; pipes solos before, during, and after drinks. If one of them goes across the road to borrow a box of matches, a piper goes with him raising Cain. Their Officers\u0027 Mess is situated just behind \"Mon Repos,\" so we live in the orchestra stalls, so to speak, and hear all there is to be heard. One evening, while Sandy Macpherson\u0027s (or Hamish MacNish\u0027s) troubles were being very poignantly aired next door, Albert Edward came to the conclusion that the limit had been reached. \"They\u0027ve been killing the pig steadily for ten days and nights now,\" said he; \"something\u0027s got to be done about it.\" \"I\u0027m with you,\" said I; \"but what are we two against a whole brigade? If they were to catch you pushing an impious pin into one of their sacred joy-bags there\u0027d be another Second Lieutenant missing.\" \"Desist and let me think,\" said Albert Edward, and for the next hour he lay on his bed rolling and groaning—the usual signs that his so-called brain is active. The following morning he rode over to the squadron, returning later with the Mess gramophone and a certain record. There are records and records, but for high velocity, armour-piercing and range this one bangs Banagher. It is a gem out of that \"sparkling galaxy of melody, mirth and talent\" (Press Agent speaking), \"I Don\u0027t Think,\" which scintillates nightly at the Frivolity Theatre. \"When the Humming-birds are singing\" is the title thereof, and Miss Birdie de Maie renders it—renders it as she alone can, in a voice like a file chafing corrugated iron. We started the birds humming at 4 p.m., and let it rip steadily until 11.15 p.m., only stopping to change needles. Albert Edward\u0027s batman unleashed the hub-bub again at six next morning; my batman relieved him at eight, and so on throughout the day in two-hour shifts. At night the line guards carried on. The following morning, as our batmen threatened to report sick, we crimed a trooper for \"dumb insolence\" and made him expiate his sin by tending the gramophone. O\u0027Dwyer, of one of the neighbouring ammunition columns, came over in the afternoon to complain that his mules couldn\u0027t get a wink of sleep and were muttering among themselves; but we gave him a bottle of whiskey and he went away quietly. Monk of the other column called an hour later to ask if we wanted to draw shell-fire; but we bought him off with a snaffle bit and a bottle of hair lotion. The whole neighbourhood grew restive. Somebody under cover of the dark took a pot at the gramophone with a revolver and winged it in the trumpet. Even the placid observation balloon which floats above our camp grew nasty and dropped binoculars and sextants on us. We built a protective breastwork of sandbags about it and carried on. As for ourselves we didn\u0027t mind the racket in the least, having taken the precaution of corking our ears with gunners\u0027 wax. Then one evening we discovered a Highland bomber worming up a drain on his stomach towards our instrument. Cornered, he excused himself on the plea that it was a form of Swedish exercise he always took at twilight for the benefit of his digestion. An ingenious explanation, but it hardly covered the live Mills bomb he was endeavouring to conceal in a fold of his kilt. We drove him away with a barrage of peg-mallets; but secretly we were very elated, for it was clear that the strain was telling on the hardy Scot. As a precautionary measure we now surrounded the gramophone with a barbed-wire entanglement, and so we carried on. Next day we saw a score of kiltie officers grouped outside their Mess, heads together, apparently in earnest consultation. Every now and again they would turn and glare darkly in our direction. \"The white chiefs hold heap big palaver over yonder,\" Albert Edward remarked. \"They\u0027re tossing up now to decide who shall come over and beard us. The braw bairn with the astrakhan knees has lost; he\u0027s cocking his bonnet and asking his pals if he\u0027s got his sporran on straight. Behold he approacheth, stepping delicately. I leave it to you, partner.\" I lay in the grass and waited for the deputation. The gramophone, safe behind its sandbags and wire, was doing business as usual, Miss Birdie yowling away like a wild cat on hot cinders. The deputation picked his way round the horse lines, nodded to me and sat down on the oil-drum we keep for the accommodation of guests. He nervously opened the ball by remarking that the weather was fine. I did not agree with him, but refused to argue. That baffled him for some seconds, but he recovered by maintaining that it was anyway finer than it had been in 1915. After that outburst he seemed at a loss for a topic of conversation, and sat scratching his ear as if he expected to get inspiration out of it as a conjurer gets rabbits. \"Ye seem verra pairtial to music?\" he ventured presently. \"Passionately,\" said I. \"Ah—hem! Ye seem verra pairtial to that one selection,\" he continued. \"Passionately devoted to it,\" said I. \"Lovely little thing; I adore its sentiment, tempo, tremolo and timbre, its fortissimo and allegro. Just listen to the part that\u0027s coming now— \u0027When the humming birds are singing And the old church bells are ringing We\u0027ll canoodle, we\u0027ll canoodle \u0027neath the moon. Down in Alabama You\u0027ll be my starry-eyed charmer; On my white-haired kitten\u0027s grave we\u0027ll sit and spoon, spoon, spoo-oo-oon.\u0027 Nifty bit of allegro work that—eh, what?\" He nodded politely. \"Ay—of course, sairtainly; but—er—er—don\u0027t ye find it grows a wee monotonous in time?\" \"Never,\" I retorted stoutly. \"Not in the least. No more than you find the Lament or Dirge of Sandy Macpherson or Hamish MacNish monotonous.\" He cocked his ears suddenly and stared at me. Then his chubby face split slowly from ear to ear in the widest grin I ever saw, and up went both his hands. \"Kamerad!\" said he.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3294/90089.html","bookId":457,"book":{"id":457,"title":"The Mudlarks","description":"简介： When I was young, my parents sent me to a boarding school, not in any hopes of getting me educated, but because they wanted a quiet home....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3294","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:47 AM"}}
