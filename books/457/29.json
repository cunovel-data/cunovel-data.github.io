{"id":41785,"no":29,"title":"XXVIII THE CONVERT","content":"I found No. 764, Trooper Hartley, W.J., in the horse lines, sitting on a hay-bale perusing a letter which seemed to give him some amusement. On seeing me he arose, clicked his spurs and saluted. I returned the salute, graciously bidding him carry on. We go through the motions of officer and man very punctiliously, William and I. In other days, in other lands, our relative positions were easier. The ceremonies over I sat down beside him on the hay-bale, and we became Bill and Jim to each other. \"Did you ever run across Gustav Müller in the old days?\" William inquired, thumbing a fistful of dark Magliesburg tobacco into his corn-cob incinerator. \"\u0027Mafoota,\u0027 the niggers called him, a beefy man with an underdone complexion.\" \"Yes,\" I said, \"he turned up in my district on the Wallaby in 1913 or thereabouts, with nothing in the world but a topee, an army overcoat and a box of parlour magic. Set up as a wizard in Chala\u0027s kraal. Used to produce yards of ribbon out of the mouths of the afflicted, and collapsible flower-pots out of their nostrils—casting out devils, you understand. Was scratching together a very comfortable practice; but he began to dabble in black politics, so I moved him on. An entertaining old rogue; I don\u0027t know what became of him.\" William winked at me through a cloud of blue tobacco smoke. \"I do. He went chasing a rainbow\u0027s end North of the Lakes, and I went along with him. You see, Gustav\u0027s great-aunt Gretchen appeared to him in a dream and told him there was alluvial gold in a certain river bed, tons of it, easy washing, so we went after it. We didn\u0027t find it; but that\u0027s neither here nor there; a man must take a chance now and again, and this was the first time Gustav\u0027s great-aunt had let him down. She\u0027d given him the straight tip for two Melbourne Cups and a Portugoose lottery in her time. Some girl, great-aunt Gretchen! Anyway there was Gustav and me away up at the tail-end of Nowhere, with the boys yapping for six months\u0027 back pay, and we couldn\u0027t have bought a feed of hay for a nightmare between us. We just naturally had to do something, so——\" \"So you just naturally took to poaching ivory,\" said I. \"I know you. Go on.\" William grinned. \"Well, a man must live, you know. How\u0027msodever we struck a bonanza vein of m\u0027jufu right away and piled up the long white nuggets in a way that would drive you to poetry. A Somali Arab took the stuff from us on the spot, paying us in cattle at a fifty-per-cent discount, which was reasonable enough, seeing that he ran ninety per cent of the risks. Everything sailed along like a beautiful dream. The elephants was that tame they\u0027d eat out of your hand, and you could stroll out and bowl over a dozen of the silly blighters before breakfast if you felt in the mood. The police hadn\u0027t got our address as yet. The only competitor that threatened got buckshot in his breeches, which changed his mind and direction for him very precipitous. The industry boomed and boomed. \"\u0027Another year of this,\u0027 says I to myself, \u0027and I\u0027ll retire home and grow roses, drive a pony-trap and be a churchwarden.\u0027 \"Then one day the Arab headman blows into camp, and squatting outside our tent, commences to lamentate and pipe his eye in a way that would make you think he\u0027d ate a skinful of prickly pears. \"\u0027What\u0027s biting you, Bluebell?\u0027 I asked. \"\u0027Allah akbar! God is good but business is rotten,\u0027 says he, and pitches a woeful yarn how that columns of Askaris was marching thither and thence, poking their flat noses in where they wasn\u0027t invited; Inglische gunboats were riding every wave, scaring seven bells out of the coast dhows, and consequently commerce was sent to blazes and a poor man couldn\u0027t get an honest living no-how. The long and short of it was that ivory smuggling was off for the period of the War. \"\u0027What war, you scum?\u0027 says Gustav, pricking his freckled ears. \u0027Who\u0027s warring?\u0027 \"\u0027The Inglische and Germans, of course,\u0027 says the Arab. \u0027Didn\u0027t the B\u0027wana know?\u0027 \"\u0027No, the B\u0027wana doesn\u0027t,\u0027 says I; \u0027our private Marconi outfit is broke down owing to the monkeys swinging on the wires. Now trot home, you barbarous ape, while me and my colleague throws a ray of pure intellect on the problem. Bassi.\u0027 \"So he soon dismisses at the double and is seen no more in them vicinities. \"\u0027Well, partner,\u0027 says I to Gustav, \u0027this is a fair knock-out—what?\u0027 \"But Gustav, he grumbles something I couldn\u0027t catch and walks off into the bush with his head down, afflicted with thought. \"He didn\u0027t come in for supper, so I scoffed his share and turned in. \"At moonrise I thought I heard a bull elephant trumpeting like he was love-sick, but it wasn\u0027t. It was Gustav coming home singing the Wacht am Rhein. He brings up opposite my bed. \"\u0027Oh, give over and let the poor lions and leopards snatch some sleep,\u0027 says I. \"\u0027I was born in Shermany,\u0027 says he. \"\u0027Don\u0027t let that keep you awake, ole man,\u0027 says I. \u0027What saith the prophet? \"If a cat kittens on a fish-plate they ain\u0027t necessarily herrings.\"\u0027 \"\u0027I\u0027m a Sherman,\u0027 says he. \"\u0027You\u0027ve been so long with white men that nobody\u0027d know it,\u0027 says I. \u0027Forget it, and I won\u0027t tell on you. Why, you ain\u0027t seen Shermany these thirty years, and you wouldn\u0027t know a squarehead if you was to trip over one. Go to bed, Mr. Caruso.\u0027 \"\u0027Well, I\u0027m going to be a mighty good Sherman now, to make up for lost time,\u0027 says he grim-like, \u0027and in case you got any objections I\u0027ll point out that you\u0027ve the double express proximitous to your stomach.\u0027 \"He had me bailed up all right. Arguments weren\u0027t no use with the cuss. \u0027I\u0027m a Sherman\u0027 was all he\u0027d say; and next day we starts to hoof it to Germany territory, me promenading in front calling Gustav every name but his proper one, and him marching behind, prodding me in the back with the blunderbuss. He disenjoyed that trip even more than I did; he had to step behind me all day for fear I\u0027d dodge him into the bush; and he sat up all night for fear the boys would rescue me. He got as red-eyed as a bear and his figure dropped off him in bucketfuls. \"At the end of a month we crossed the border and hit the trail of the Deutscher—burnt villages everywhere, with the mutilated bodies of women and picaninnies lying about, stakes driven through \u0027em, Waugh! \"\u0027Are you still a Sherman?\u0027 I asks; but Gustav says nothing; he\u0027d gone a bit white about the gills all the same. Then one morning we tumbles into one of their columns and the game is up. I was given a few swipes with a kiboko for welcome and hauled before the Commander, a little short cove with yellow hair, a hand-carved jaw and spectacles. He diagnosed my case as serious, prescribed me some more kiboko, and I was hove into a grass hut under guard, pending the obsequies. \"The Officers called Gustav a good sport, gave him a six-by-four cigar and took him off to dinner. I noticed he looked back at me once or twice. So I sits down in the hut and meditates on some persons\u0027 sense of humour, with a big Askari buck padding it up and down outside, whiling away the sunny hours with a bit of disembowelling practice on his bayonet. \"A couple of days flits by while the column is away spreading the good word with fire and stake. Then on the third night I hears a scuffle outside the hut, and the Askari comes somersaulting backwards through the grass wall like as if an earthquake had butted him in the brisket. He gave a couple of kicks and stretched out like as if he was tired. \"\u0027Whist! Is that you, Bill?\u0027 comes a whisper through the hole. \"\u0027What\u0027s left of me,\u0027 says I. \u0027Who are you?\u0027 \"\u0027Me—Gustav,\u0027 says the whisperer. \"\u0027What\u0027s the antic this time? Capturing me again?\u0027 says I. \"\u0027No, I\u0027m rescuing you now,\u0027 says he. \"\u0027The devil you are,\u0027 says I, and with that I glided out through the hole and followed him on my stomach. A sentry gave tongue at the scrub-edge, but Gustav rose up out of the grass and bumped him behind the ear and we went on. \"\u0027Well, you\u0027re a lovely quick-change artist, capturing a bloke one moment and rescuing him the next,\u0027 says I presently. \u0027What\u0027s come over you? Ain\u0027t you a Sherman no more?\u0027 \"Gustav groans as if his heart was broke. \u0027I\u0027ve been away thirty years. I didn\u0027t know they was like that; I\u0027d forgotten. Oh, my Gawd, what swine!\u0027 He spits like a man that has bit sour beer, and we ran on again.\" \"Didn\u0027t they chase you?\" I asked. William nodded. \"But they couldn\u0027t catch two old bush-bucks like us, and the next day we fell in with a British column that was out hunting them. \u0027Twas a merry meeting. Gustav enlisted with the Britishers on the spot.\" William tapped the travel-soiled letter in his hand. \"This is from him. He\u0027s down in Nairobi, wounded. He says he\u0027s sitting up taking nourishment, and that great-aunt Gretchen has appeared to him again and showed him a diamond pipe in the Khali Hari, which will require a bit of looking into après la guerre—if there ever is any après.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3294/90104.html","bookId":457,"book":{"id":457,"title":"The Mudlarks","description":"简介： When I was young, my parents sent me to a boarding school, not in any hopes of getting me educated, but because they wanted a quiet home....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3294","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:47 AM"}}
