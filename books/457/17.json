{"id":41773,"no":17,"title":"XVII THE PINCH OF WAR","content":"I came across him on the rim of the bog. He stood before a whitewashed cabin glaring fiercely over the brown world. A coal-black dudeen hung empty and bottom up from his puckered mouth, a rumpled frieze cap was perilously balanced atop of a fringe of white hair. His full figure, upholstered in a worn velvet waistcoat, was thrust well forward as if daring Fate to hit it another blow. At the moment he was acting as a scratching-post to a large white billy-goat, which chafed itself luxuriously to and fro against his straddled legs. At the sound of my horse\u0027s hoofs he turned his head. At the sight of my uniform his eyes brightened, he withdrew a smutty hand from a corduroy pocket and made a travesty of a salute towards his cap, which almost lost its balance. \"Hey! Good day to ye, Captain!\" (I am a second lieutenant, but in Ireland every lance-corporal has visionary batons on his shoulder-straps.) I replied suitably, agreed that the weather was fine for the second and trusted, if we were good, we might have an hour of it. \"How is it wid the War this mornin\u0027, yer honour?\" I replied that, as far as I knew, it was still there, had passed a quiet night and was doing nicely, thanks. \"Was you ever at the Front, Captain?\" I nodded, and at that his eyes gleamed. \"Begob!—then \u0027tis yerself has the luck. Wait till I tell you a minute. I\u0027m afther wishin\u0027 be all the Blessed Saints I was twinty year younger, \u0027tis meself would be the first afther them German Daygoes—I would so, the dirthy, desthroyin\u0027 blagyards! Tell me now, Captain dear, did you ever kill wan of them at all?\" He hung on my answer to such an extent that the white billy tore a tatter from his canvas coat and ate it unrebuked. I wagged my head. \"Don\u0027t know—couldn\u0027t say.\" \"Och, shure, no! What would a grand gentleman like yourself be wantin\u0027 wid such dirthy work—\u0027tis a common private\u0027s job, so it is. But was meself twinty year younger \u0027twould be a job I would take great delight in the doin\u0027 of it. I would take great delight in landin\u0027 wan o\u0027 them blagyards a puck wid a bay\u0027net that would let the daylight through him. I would have great courage an\u0027 delight in a war wid such as they be, that\u0027s the blessed truth, the dirthy, desthroyin\u0027, murdherin\u0027 divils! Arragh! I hate them!\" He shook a grimy fist in the general direction of America, and the billy, undisturbed, reached up and ate another ribbon off his coat. \"Beggin\u0027 yer pardon, but will yer honour be goin\u0027 back to the War?\" I said I hoped so some day. \"Listen, then—I\u0027m wishin\u0027 ye would kill a German, two Germans, d\u0027ye hear me now? Two Germans I\u0027m afther wishin\u0027 ye.\" Again he brandished a trembling fist aloft and again the billy, fearing naught, grazed its way up his back. \"Thanks, very good of you,\" said I. \"I\u0027ll remember. Good day.\" \"Good day it is, an\u0027 God save yer honour!\" Then with an overwhelming burst of generosity he promoted me two ranks at once and wished again. \"Colonel,\" he said solemnly, though shaking with passion, \"I\u0027m afther wishin\u0027 ye three—ten—fifteen Germans!\" \"Thanks,\" I said again, and picked up the reins, wondering if tragedy had shadowed the bogside that morning, if some grey-eyed, black-haired boy would come home no more from Flanders to that whitewashed cabin. As I turned a beshawled girl poked her head round the door lintel and smiled at me. \"Och, faith, don\u0027t be noticin\u0027 the granda\u0027, yer honour; himself was beyond to the town this mornin\u0027, an\u0027 they\u0027ve riz the price o\u0027 porther on him wan ha\u0027penny. He do be as mad as the Sivinteen Divils!\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3294/90092.html","bookId":457,"book":{"id":457,"title":"The Mudlarks","description":"简介： When I was young, my parents sent me to a boarding school, not in any hopes of getting me educated, but because they wanted a quiet home....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3294","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:47 AM"}}
