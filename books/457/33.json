{"id":41789,"no":33,"title":"XXXII THE CAMERA CANNOT LIE","content":"When I was young I was extremely handsome. I have documentary evidence to prove as much. There is in existence a photograph of a young gentleman standing with his back to a raging seascape, one hand resting lightly on a volume of Shakespeare, which in turn is supported by a rustic table. The young gentleman has wide innocent eyes, a rosebud mouth and long golden curls (the sort poor dear old Romney used to do so nicely). For the rest he is tastefully upholstered in a short-panted velvet suit, a lace collar and white silk socks. \"Little Lord Fauntleroy,\" you murmur to yourself. No, Sir (or Madam), it is ME—or was me, rather. When I was young no girl thought herself properly married unless I was present at the ceremony, got up like a prize rabbit and tethered to the far end of her train. Nowadays I am not so handsome. True, you can urge a horse past me without blindfolding it and all that, but nobody ever mistakes me for Maxine Elliott. Personally I was quite willing to be represented at the National Portrait Gallery by a coloured copy of the presentment described above, but my home authorities thought otherwise, and when last I was in England on leave—shortly after the Battle of Agincourt—they shooed me off to Valpré. \"Go to Valpré,\" they said; \"he is so artistic.\" So to Valpré I went, and was admitted by a handmaid who waved a white hand vaguely towards a selection of doors, murmuring, \"Wait there, please.\" I opened the nearest door at a venture and entered. In the waiting-room three other handmaids were at work on photographs. One was painting dimples on a lady\u0027s cheek; one filling in gaps in a Second-Lieutenant\u0027s moustache; one straightening the salient of a stockbroker\u0027s waistcoat. Presently the first handmaid reappeared and somewhat curtly (I was waiting in the wrong room, it seemed) informed me that the Master was ready. So I went upstairs to the operating theatre. After an impressive interval a curtain was thrust aside and the Master entered. He was not in the least like the artist of my first photograph, who had chirruped and done tricks with an indiarubber monkey to make me prick my ears and appear sagacious. This man had the mane of a poodle, a plush smoking-jacket with rococo trimmings, satin cravat, rings and bangles like the lads in La Bohème, and I knew myself to be in the presence of True Art, and bowed my head. At the sight of me he winced visibly; didn\u0027t seem to like my looks at all. However he pulled himself together and advanced to reconnoitre. He pushed me into a chair, manipulated some screws at the back, and I found my head fast in a steel clamp. I pleaded for gas or cocaine, but he took no notice and prowled off to the far end of the theatre to observe if distance would lend any enchantment. Apparently it would not. The more he saw of me the less he seemed to admire the view. Suddenly the fire of inspiration lit his eye and he came for me. I struggled with the clamp, but it clave like a bull-terrier to a mutton chop. In a moment he had me by the head and started to mould it nearer to his heart\u0027s desire with plump powerful hands. He crammed half my lower jaw into my breast pocket, pinned my ears back so tightly that they wouldn\u0027t wag for weeks, pressed my nose down with his thumb as though it were the button of an electric bell and generally kneaded my features from the early Hibernian to the late Gr?co-Roman. Then, before they could rebound to their normal positions, he had sprung back, jerked the lanyard and fired the camera. Some weeks later the finished photographs arrived. The handmaids had done their bit, and the result was a pleasing portraiture, an objet d\u0027art, an ornament to anybody\u0027s family album. The man Valpré was an artist all right. A few days ago the Skipper whistled me into the orderly room. His table was littered with parade states, horse-registers and slips of cardboard, all intermingled. The Skipper himself appeared to be undergoing some heavy mental disturbance. His forehead was furrowed, his toupet rumpled, and he sucked his fountain-pen, unconsciously imbibing much dark nourishment. \"Identification cards,\" he explained, indicating the slips. \"Got to carry \u0027em now. Comply with Italian regulations. Been trying to describe you. Napoo.\" He prodded the result towards me. I scanned it and decided he had got it mixed with horse-registers. It read as follows:— Born . . . . . . . Yes. Height . . . . . . 17 hands. Hair . . . . . . . Bay. Eyes . . . . . . . Two. Nose . . . . . . . Undulating. Moustache . . . . Hogged. Complexion . . . . Natural. Special Marks . . The Skipper pointed to the blank space. \"That\u0027s what I want to know—special marks. Got any? Snip, blaze, white fetlock, anything?\" \"Yessir,\" said I. \"Strawberry patch on off gaskin.\" He sucked thoughtfully at his fountain-pen. \"Mmph,\" he said, \"shouldn\u0027t mention it if I were you. Don\u0027t want to have to undress in the middle of the street every time you meet an Intelligence, do you?\" I agreed that I did not—not before June, anyhow. The Skipper turned to the card again and frowned. \"Couldn\u0027t call it a speaking likeness exactly, this little pen-picture of you, could one? If you only had a photograph of yourself now.\" \"I have, Sir,\" said I brightly. \"Good Lord, man, why didn\u0027t you say so before? Here, take this and paste the thing in. Now trot away.\" I trotted away and pasted Valpré\u0027s objet d\u0027art on to the card. Yesterday evening Albert Edward and I were riding out of a certain Italian town (no names, no pack drill). Albert Edward got involved in a right-of-way argument between five bullock wagons and two lorries, and I jogged on ahead. On the fringe of the town was a barrier presided over by a brace of Carabinieri caparisoned with war material, whiskers and cocked hats of the style popularised by Bonaparte. Also an officer. As I moved to pass the barrier the officer spied me and, not liking my looks (as I hinted before, nobody does), signed to me to halt. Had I an identification card, please? I had and handed it to him. He took the card and ran a keen eye over the Skipper\u0027s little pen-picture and Valpré\u0027s \"Portrait Study,\" then over their alleged original. \"Lieutenant,\" said he grimly, \"these don\u0027t tally. This is not you.\" I protested that it was. He shook his head with great conviction, \"Never! The nose in this photograph is straight; the ears retiring; the jaw, normal. While with you—— [Continental politeness restrained him]. Lieutenant, you must come with me.\" He beckoned to a Napoleonic corporal, who approached, clanking his war material. I saw myself posed for a firing squad at grey dawn and shivered all over. I detest early rising. By this time the corporal had outflanked me, clanking more munitions, and I was on the point of being marched off to the Bastille, or whatever they call it, when Albert Edward suddenly insinuated himself into the party and addressed himself to the officer. \"Half a minute, Mongsewer [any foreigner is Mongsewer to Albert Edward]. The photograph is of him all right, but it was taken before his accident.\" \"His accident?\" queried the officer. \"Yes,\" said Albert Edward; \"sad affair, shell-shock. A crump burst almost in his face, and shocked it all out of shape. Can\u0027t you see?\" The Italian leaned forward and subjected my flushed features to a piercing scrutiny; then his dark eyes softened almost to tears, and he handed me back my card and saluted. \"Sir, you have my apologies—and sympathy. Good evening.\" \"Albert Edward,\" said I, as we trotted into the dusk, \"you may be a true friend but you are no gentleman.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3294/90108.html","bookId":457,"book":{"id":457,"title":"The Mudlarks","description":"简介： When I was young, my parents sent me to a boarding school, not in any hopes of getting me educated, but because they wanted a quiet home....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3294","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:47 AM"}}
