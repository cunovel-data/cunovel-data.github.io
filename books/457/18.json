{"id":41774,"no":18,"title":"XVIII THE REGIMENTAL MASCOT","content":"When his honour the Colonel took the owld rigiment to France, Herself came home bringin\u0027 the rigimental mascot with her. A big white long-haired billy-goat he was, the same. \"I\u0027ll not be afther lavin\u0027 him at the daypo,\" says Herself; \"\u0027tis no place for a domestic animal at all, the language them little drummer-boys uses, the dear knows,\" says she. So me bowld mascot he stops up at the Castle and makes free with the flower-beds and the hall and the drawin\u0027-room and the domestic maids the way he\u0027d be the Lord-Lieutenant o\u0027 the land, and not jist a plain human Angory goat. A proud arrygent crature it is, be the powers! Steppin\u0027 about as disdainy as a Dublin gerrl in Ballydehob, and if, mebbe, you\u0027d address him for to get off your flower-beds with the colour of anger in your mouth he\u0027d let a roar out of him like a Sligo piper with poteen taken, and fetch you a skelp with his horns that would lay you out for dead. And sorra the use is it of complainin\u0027 to Herself. \"Ah, Delaney, \u0027tis the marshal sperit widin him,\" she\u0027d say; \"we must be patient with him for the sake of the owld rigiment\"; and with that she\u0027d start hand-feedin\u0027 him with warmed-up sponge cake and playin\u0027 with his long silky hair. \"Far be it from me,\" I says to Mikeen, the herd, \"to question the workings o\u0027 Providence, but were I the Colonel of a rigiment, which I am not, and had to have a mascot, it\u0027s not a raparee billy I\u0027d be afther havin\u0027, but a nanny, or mebbe a cow, that would step along dacently with the rigiment and bring ye luck, and mebbe a dropeen o\u0027 milk for the orficers\u0027 tea as well. If it\u0027s such cratures that bring ye fortune may I die a peaceful death in a poor-house,\" says I. \"I\u0027m wid ye,\" says Mikeen, groanin\u0027, he bein\u0027 spotted like a leopard with bruises by rason of him havin\u0027 to comb the mascot\u0027s silky hair twice daily, and the quick temper of the baste at the tangles. The long of a summer the billy stops up at the Castle, archin\u0027 his neck at the wurrld and growin\u0027 prouder and prouder by dint of the standin\u0027 he had with the owld rigiment and the high feedin\u0027 he had from Herself. Faith, \u0027tis a great delight we servints had of him I\u0027m tellin\u0027 ye! It was as much as your life\u0027s blood was worth to cross his path in the garden, and if the domestic maids would be meetin\u0027 him in the house they\u0027d let him eat the dresses off them before they dare say a word. In the autumn me bowld mascot gets a wee trifle powerful by dint o\u0027 the high feedin\u0027 and the natural nature of the crature. Herself, wid her iligant lady\u0027s nose, is afther noticin\u0027 it, and she sends wan o\u0027 the gerrls to tell meself and Mikeen to wash the baste. \"There will be murdher done this day,\" says I to the lad, \"but \u0027tis the orders. Go get the cart rope and the chain off the bulldog, and we\u0027ll do it. Faith, it isn\u0027t all the bravery that\u0027s at the Front,\" says I. \"That\u0027s the true wurrd,\" says he, rubbin\u0027 the lumps on his shins, the poor boy. \"Oh, Delaney,\" says the domestic gerrl, drawin\u0027 a bottle from her apron pocket. \"Herself says will ye plaze be so obligin\u0027 as to sprinkle the mascot wid a dropeen of this ody-koloney scent—mebbe it will quench his powerfulness, she says.\" I put the bottle in me pocket. We tripped up me brave goat with the rope, got the bull\u0027s collar and chain, and dragged him away towards the pond, him buckin\u0027 and ragin\u0027 between us like a Tyrone Street lady in the arms of the poliss. To hear the roars he let out of him would turn your hearts cowld as lead, but we held on. The Saints were wid us; in half an hour we had him as wet as an eel, and broke the bottle of ody-koloney over his back. He was clane mad. \"God save us all when he gets that chain off him!\" I says. \"God save us it is!\" says Mikeen, looking around for a tree to shin. Just at the minut we heard a great screechin\u0027 o\u0027 dogs, and through the fence comes the harrier pack that the Reserve orficers kept in the camp beyond. (\"Harriers\" they called them, but, begob! there wasn\u0027t anythin\u0027 they wouldn\u0027t hunt from a fox to a turkey, those ones.) \"What are they afther chasin\u0027?\" says Mikeen. \"\u0027Tis a stag to-day, be the newspapers,\" I says, \"but the dear knows they\u0027ll not cotch him this month, be must be gone by this half-hour, and the breath is from them, their tongues is hangin\u0027 out a yard,\" I says. \u0027Twas at that moment the Blessed Saints gave me wisdom. \"Mikeen,\" I says, \"drag the mascot out before them; we\u0027ll see sport this day.\" \"Herself——\" he begins. \"Hoult your whisht,\" says I, \"and come on.\" With that we dragged me bowld goat out before the dogs and let go the chain. The dogs sniffed up the strong blast of ody-koloney and let a yowl out of them like all the banshees in the nation of Ireland, and the billy legged it for his life—small blame to him! Meself and Mikeen climbed a double to see the sport. \"They have him,\" says Mikeen. \"They have not,\" says I; \"the crature howlds them by two lengths.\" \"He has doubled on them,\" says Mikeen; \"he is as sly as a Jew.\" \"He is forninst the rabbit holes now,\" I says. \"I thank the howly Saints he cannot burrow.\" \"He has tripped up—they have him bayed,\" says Mikeen. And that was the mortal truth, the dogs had him. Oh, but it was a bowld billy! He went in among those hounds like a lad to a fair, you could hear his horns lambastin\u0027 their ribs a mile away. But they were too many for him and bit the grand silky hair off him by the mouthful. The way it flew you\u0027d think it was a snowstorm. \"They have him desthroyed,\" says Mikeen. \"They have,\" says I, \"God be praised!\" At the moment the huntsman leps his harse up on the double beside us; he was phlastered with muck from his hair to his boots. \"What have they out there?\" says he, blinkin\u0027 through the mud and not knowin\u0027 rightly what his hounds were coursin\u0027 out before him, whether it would be a stag or a Bengal tiger. \"\u0027Tis her ladyship\u0027s Rile Imperial Mascot Goat,\" says I; \"an\u0027 God save your honour, for she\u0027ll have your blood in a bottle for this day\u0027s worrk.\" The huntsman lets a curse out of his stummick and rides afther them, flat on his saddle, both spurs tearin\u0027. In the wink of an eye he is down among the dogs, larrupin\u0027 them with his whip and drawin\u0027 down curses on them that would wither ye to hear him—he had great eddication, that orficer. \"Come now,\" says I to Mikeen, the poor lad, \"let you and me bear the cowld corpse of the diseased back to Herself, mebbe she\u0027ll have a shillin\u0027 handy in her hand, the way she\u0027d reward us for saving the body from the dogs,\" says I. But was me bowld mascot dead? He was not. He was alive and well, the thickness of his wool had saved him. For all that he had not a hair of it left to him, and when he stood up before you, you wouldn\u0027t know him; he was that ordinary without his fleece, he was no more than a common poor man\u0027s goat, he was no more to look at than a skinned rabbit, and that\u0027s the truth. He walked home with meself and Mikeen as meek as a young gerrl. Herself came runnin\u0027 out, all fluttery, to look at him. \"Ah, but that\u0027s not my mascot,\" she says. \"It is, Marm,\" says I; and I swore to it by the whole Calendar—Mikeen too. \"Bah! how disgustin\u0027. Take it to the cowhouse,\" says she, and stepped indoors without another word. We led the billy away, him hangin\u0027 his head for shame at his nakedness. \"Ye\u0027ll do no more mascotin\u0027 avic,\" says I to him. \"Sorra luck you would bring to a blind beggar-man the way you are now—you\u0027ll never step along again with the drums and tambourines.\" And that was the true word, for though Herself had Mikeen rubbing him daily with bear\u0027s grease and hair lotion he never grew the same grand fleece again, and he\u0027d stand about in the backfield, brooding for hours together, the divilment clane gone out of his system; and if, mebbe, you\u0027d draw the stroke of an ash-plant across his ribs to hearten him, he\u0027d only just look at you, sad-like and pass no remarks. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3294/90093.html","bookId":457,"book":{"id":457,"title":"The Mudlarks","description":"简介： When I was young, my parents sent me to a boarding school, not in any hopes of getting me educated, but because they wanted a quiet home....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3294","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:47 AM"}}
