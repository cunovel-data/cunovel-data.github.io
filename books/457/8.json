{"id":41764,"no":8,"title":"VIII NATIONAL ANTHEM","content":"Out here the telephone exists largely as a vehicle for the jeux d\u0027esprit of the Brass Lids. It is a one-way affair, working only from the inside out, for if you have a trifle of repartee to impart to the Brazen Ones, the apparatus is either indefinitely engaged, or Na poo (as the French say). If you are one of these bulldog lads and are determined to make the thing talk from the outside in, you had better migrate chez Signals, taking your bed, blankets, beer, tobacco and the unexpired portion of next week\u0027s ration, and camp at the telephone orderly\u0027s elbow. After a day or two it will percolate through to the varlet\u0027s intelligence that you are a desperate dog in urgent need of something, and he will bestir himself, and mayhap in a further two or three days\u0027 time he will wind a crank, pull some strings, and announce that you are \"on,\" and you will find yourself in animated conversation with an inspector of cemeteries, a jam expert at the Base, or the Dalai Lama. If you want to give back-chat to the Staff you had best take it there by hand. A friend of mine by name of Patrick once got the job of Temporary Assistant Deputy Lance Staff Captain (unpaid), and before he tumbled to the one-way idea, his telephone worked both ways and gave him a lot of trouble. People were always calling him up and asking him questions, which of course wasn\u0027t playing the game at all. Sometimes he never got to bed before 10 p.m., answering questions; often he was up again at 9 a.m., answering more questions—and such questions! A sample. On one occasion he rang up his old battalion. One Jimmy was then Acting Assistant Vice-Adjutant. \"Hello, wazzermatter?\" said Jimmy. \"Staff Captain speaking,\" said Patrick sternly. \"Please furnish a return of all cooks, smoke-helmets, bombs, mules, Yukon packs, tin bowlers, grease-traps and Plymouth Brothers you have in the field!\" \"Easy—beg pardon, yes, Sir,\" said Jimmy and hung up. Presently the \u0027phone buzzed and there was Jimmy again. \"Excuse me, Sir, but you wanted a return of various commodities we have in the field. What field?\" \"Oh, the field of Mars, fat-head!\" Patrick snapped and rang off. A quarter of an hour later he was called to the \u0027phone once more and the familiar bleat of Jimmy tickled his ear. \"Excuse me, Sir—whose mother?\" On the other hand the great Brass Hat is human and makes a slip, a clerical error, now and again, sufficient to expose his flank. And then the humble fighting man can draw his drop of blood if he is quick about it. To this same long-suffering Jimmy was vouchsafed the heaven-sent opportunity, and he leapt at it. He got a chit from H.Q., dated 6/7/17, which ran thus:— \"In reference to 17326 Pte. Hogan we note that his date of birth is 10/7/17. Please place him in his proper category.\" To which Jimmy replied:— \"As according to your showing 17326 Pte. Hogan will not be born for another four days we are placed in a position of some difficulty. Signed ———— \"P.S.—What if, when the interesting event occurs 17326 Pte. Hogan should be a girl? \"P.S.S.—Or twins?\" Our Albert Edward is just back from one of those Army finishing schools where the young subaltern\u0027s knowledge of Shakespeare and the use of the globes is given a final shampoo before he is pushed over the top. Albert Edward\u0027s academy was situated in a small town where schools are maintained by all our brave Allies; it is an educational centre. The French school does the honours of the place and keeps a tame band, which gives tongue every Sunday evening in the Grand Place. Thither repair all the young ladies of the town to hear the music. Thither also repair all the young subalterns, also for the purpose of hearing the music. At the end of every performance the national anthems of all our brave Allies are played, each brave Ally standing rigidly to attention the while, in compliment to the others. As we have a lot of brave Allies these days, all with long national war-whoops, this becomes somewhat of a strain. One morning the French bandmaster called on the Commandant of the English school. \"Some Americans have arrived,\" said he. \"They are naturally as welcome as the sunshine, but\" (he sighed) \"it means yet another national anthem.\" The Commandant sighed and said he supposed so. \"By the way,\" said the chef d\u0027orchestre, \"what is the American national anthem?\" \"\u0027Yankee Doodle,\u0027\" replied the Commandant. The Chief Instructor said he\u0027d always understood it was \"Hail, Columbia.\" The Adjutant was of the opinion that \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" filled the bill, while the Quartermaster cast his vote for \"My Country, \u0027tis of thee.\" The chef d\u0027orchestre thrashed his bosom and rent his coiffure. \"Dieu!\" he wailed, \"I can\u0027t play all of them—figurez-vous!\" Without stopping to do any figuring they heartily agreed that he couldn\u0027t. \"Tell you what,\" said the Commandant at length, \"write to your music merchant in Paris and leave it to him.\" The chef d\u0027orchestre said he would, and did so. Next Sunday evening, as the concert drew to a close, the band flung into the Marseillaise, and the subalterns of all nations leapt to attention. They stood to attention through \"God Save the King,\" through the national anthems of Russia, Italy, Portugal, Rumania, Serbia, Belgium, Montenegro and Monte Carlo, all our brave Allies. Then the chef d\u0027orchestre suddenly sprang upon a stool and waved above his head the stripes and stars of our newest brave Ally, while the band crashed into the opening strains of \"When the midnight choo-choo starts for Alabam.\" It speaks volumes for the discipline of the Allied armies that their young subalterns stood to attention even through that.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3294/90083.html","bookId":457,"book":{"id":457,"title":"The Mudlarks","description":"简介： When I was young, my parents sent me to a boarding school, not in any hopes of getting me educated, but because they wanted a quiet home....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3294","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:47 AM"}}
