{"id":41783,"no":27,"title":"XXVI THERE AND BACK","content":"My batman is a man with a grievance. He squats outside my tent all day moodily burnishing my buttons and swears and sighs, sighs and swears. In the words of my groom and countryman, \"Ye\u0027d think there\u0027d be a black dog atin\u0027 the hearrt in his shest the way he is, the poor scut.\" I learn that he has given out that if he sees a crump coming he\u0027ll \"Blinkin\u0027 well wait for it,\" that he presented his bosom chum with a black eye gratis, and is declining beer. All this sounds like love, but isn\u0027t. This is the way of it. Last week after nineteen months\u0027 undetected misbehaviour in the tented field, he was granted ten days\u0027 leave. He departed radiant as a May morn, groomed and glittering from spurs to cap badge. Within three days he was back again. According to his version of the affair, he reached the coast in good order and was given a hearty meal by some ladies in a canteen but lost it in mid-Channel. Owing to mines, air raids, and things both boat and train were scandalously late, but in the end he arrived at Victoria at 6 a.m. still in good order. Outside the station were a number of civilians waiting for soldier relatives. One of them, a small sandy man in a black bowler and tie, very respectable (connected with the retail undertaking trade, my batman says) accosted him and inquired whether anything had been seen of his brother Charlie, a territorial bombardier who was supposed to be coming by that train, but had not materialized. My batman could give no information and they fell into a discussion as to what could have happened to Charlie: whether he might have missed the train or fallen off the boat. My batman favoured the latter theory, he had felt very like it himself, he said. One thing led to another and presently the sandy man said: \"Well, what about it?\" lifting his elbow suggestively, and winking. My batman said he didn\u0027t mind if he did, so they adjourned to a little place near by that the sandy man knew of, and had one or two, the sandy man behaving like a perfect gentleman throughout, standing drink for drink, cigar for cigar. At 7 a.m. or thereabouts, the sandy man excused himself on the plea of business (which he explained was very healthy owing to the inclemency of the weather) and betook himself off, my batman returning to Victoria to retrieve his pack. By this time his order was not so good as it had been, owing, he thinks, to (a) the excitement of being home again, hearing civilians all talking English and seeing so many intact houses at once; (b) the bereaved state of his stomach. Whatever it was he navigated to the station with difficulty and \"comin\u0027 over all dizzy like,\" reclined on a platform bench and closed his eyes. When he opened them again it was to see the white cliffs of Albion rapidly disappearing over the stern rail of a trooper. He closed his eyes again and told himself he was dreaming, but not for long—he might deceive his reason but not his stomach. He soon saw that he was in mid-Channel going back to France. He sat up on deck and shouted for someone to stop the ship. \"\u0027E\u0027s come to, Bill,\" said a familiar voice at his side, and turning, he beheld the cheerful countenances of Frederick Wilkes and William Buck, two stalwarts of \"ours\" who were returning from leave. My batman asked Frederick Wilkes what he thought he was doing of. \"Saving you from six months in clink for over-staying your leaf, ol\u0027 dear!\" Frederick replied cheerfully. \"Me and Bill found you on the station, blind to the world, so we loaded you on the train and bringed you along. Pretty job we had of it, too, getting you past the red-caps, you slopping about like a lu-natic.\" \"Clink! Overstayin\u0027 my leaf!\" shrilled my batman. \"Gor-blimy! I ain\u0027t \u0027ad no leaf—I only just landed!\" \"Delerious again, Bill,\" said Frederick, and Bill nodded. \"Of course you\u0027ve had your leaf, an\u0027 a wonderful good leaf, too, by the looks of you—blind to the world from start to finish, not knowin\u0027 dark from daylight.\" \"I\u0027ll tell the first R.T.O. I see all about it when I land—you perishin\u0027 kidnappers!\" foamed my batman. \"Ho no, you won\u0027t!\" said Frederick, complacently. \"We aren\u0027t going to \u0027ave you runnin\u0027 about in your light-\u0027eaded condition disgracin\u0027 the regiment—are we, Bill?\" \"Not likely,\" William Buck replied. \"We\u0027re going to take you back with us, safe and sound if we \u0027ave to break your neck to do it, an\u0027 don\u0027t you forget it, ol\u0027 man!\" I think it is extremely improbable that my batman ever will. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3294/90102.html","bookId":457,"book":{"id":457,"title":"The Mudlarks","description":"简介： When I was young, my parents sent me to a boarding school, not in any hopes of getting me educated, but because they wanted a quiet home....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3294","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:47 AM"}}
