{"id":41787,"no":31,"title":"XXX THE HARRIERS (I)","content":"The Boche having lately done a retreat—\"strategic retirement,\" \"tactical adjustment,\" \"elastic evasion,\" or whatever Ludendorff is calling it this week—in plain words the Boche, having gloriously trotted backwards off a certain slice of France, Albert Edward and I found ourselves attached to a Corps H.Q. operating in a wilderness of grass-grown fields, ruined villages and smoking chateaux. One evening Albert Edward loitered up to the hen-house I was occupying at the time and chatted to me through the wires as I shaved. \"Put up seventeen hares and ten covey of partridges visiting outposts to-day—take my advice and scrap that moustache while you\u0027re about it, it must be a heavy drain on your system—and twenty hares and four covey riding home. Do you find lathering the ears improves their growth, or what?\" \"The country is crawling with game,\" said I, ignoring his personalities, \"and here we are hanging body and soul together on bully and dog biscuit.\" \"Exactly,\" said Albert Edward, \"and in the meanwhile the festive lapin breeds and breeds. Has it ever occurred to you that, if something isn\u0027t done soon, we\u0027ll have Australia\u0027s sad story over again here in Picardy? Give the rabbits a chance and in no time they\u0027ll have eaten off all the crops in France. Why, on the Burra I\u0027ve seen——\" \"One moment,\" said I; \"if I listen to your South Australian rabbit story again you\u0027ve got to listen to my South African locust yarn; it\u0027s only fair.\" \"Oh, shut up,\" Albert Edward growled; \"can\u0027t you understand this question is deadly serious?\" \"Best put the Tanks on to \u0027em then,\" I suggested; \"they\u0027d enjoy themselves, and the Waterloo Cup wouldn\u0027t be in it—Captain Monkey-Wrench\u0027s brindled whippet, \u0027Sardine Tin,\u0027 6 to 4; Major Spanner\u0027s \u0027Pig Iron,\u0027 7 to 2; even money the field.\" \"Your humour is a trifle strained,\" said Albert Edward; \"if you\u0027re not careful you\u0027ll crack a joke at the expense of a tendon one of these days.\" \"Look here,\" said I, wiping the blood off my safety-razor, \"you\u0027re evidently struggling to give expression to some heavy brain wave; out with it.\" \"What about a pack of harriers?\" said Albert Edward. \"There must be swarms of sportive tykes about, faithful Fidos that have stuck to the dear old homestead through thick and thin, also refugee animals that follow the sweet-scented infantry cookers. I\u0027ve got my old hunting-horn; you\u0027ve got your old crop; between the two we ought to be able to mobilize \u0027em a bit and put the wind up these darn hares. I\u0027m going to try anyway. I may say I look on it as a duty.\" \"Looked on in that light it\u0027s a sacred duty,\" said I; \"and—er—incidentally we might reap a haunch of hare out of it now and again, mightn\u0027t we?\" \"Incidentally, yes,\" said Albert Edward, \"and a trifle of sport into the bargain—incidentally.\" So we set about collecting a pack there and then by offering our servants five francs per likely dog and no questions asked. No questions were asked, but I have a strong suspicion that our gentlemen were up all night and that there were dark deeds done in the dead of it, for the very next evening my groom and countryman presented us with a bill for forty-five francs. The dogs, he informed us, were kennelled \"in a little shmall place the like of an ice-house\" at the northern extremity of the chateau grounds, and that \"anyway a blind man himself couldn\u0027t miss them wid the screechin\u0027 an\u0027 hollerin\u0027 they are afther raisin\u0027 be dint of the confinement.\" I had an appointment with the Q. Staff (to explain why I had indented for sixty-four horse rations while only possessing thirty-two horses, the excuse that they all enjoyed very healthy appetites apparently not sufficing), so Albert Edward went forth to inspect the pack alone. He came into Mess very late, looking hot and dishevelled. \"My word, they\u0027ve looted a blooming menagerie,\" he panted in my ear; \"still, couldn\u0027t expect to pick Pytchley puppies off every bush, I suppose.\" \"What have they got, actually?\" I inquired. \"Two couple of Belgian light-draught dogs—you know, the kind they hitch on to any load too heavy for a horse—an asthmatic beagle, an an?mic bloodhound, a domesticated wolf, an unfrocked poodle, and a sort of dropsical pug.\" \"What on earth is the pug for?\" I asked. \"Luck,\" said Albert Edward. \"Your henchman says \u0027them kind of little dogs do be bringing ye luck,\u0027 and backs it up with a very convincing yarn of an uncle of his in Bally-something who had a lucky dog—\u0027as like this wan here as two spits, except maybe for the least little curliness of the tail\u0027—which provided complete immunity from ghosts, witches\u0027 evil and ingrowing toe-nails. I thought it cheap at five francs.\" \"But, good Lord, that lot\u0027ll never hunt hares,\" I protested. \"Won\u0027t they?\" said Albert Edward grimly. \"With the only meal they\u0027ll ever see prancing along in front of them, and you and me prancing along behind scourging \u0027em with scorpions, I rather fancy they will. By the way, I know you won\u0027t mind, but I\u0027ve had to shift your bed out under the chestnut-tree; it\u0027s really quite a good tree as trees go.\" \"But why can\u0027t I stop in my hen-house?\" I objected. \"Because I\u0027ve just moved the pack there,\" said he. \"But why?\" I went on. \"What\u0027s the matter with the ice-house?\" \"That\u0027s just it,\" he hissed in my ear; \"it isn\u0027t an ice-house—never was; it\u0027s the De Valcourt family vault.\" The next day being propitious, we decided to hold our first meet that evening, and issued a few invitations. The Veterinary Bloke and the Field Cashier promised to show up, likewise the Padre, once the sacredness of our cause had been explained to him. At noon \"stables\" Albert Edward reported the pack in fine fettle. \"Kicking up a fearful din and look desperate enough to hunt a holy angel,\" said he. \"At five o\u0027clock, me lad, Hard forrard! Tally-ho! and Odds-boddikins!\" However at 4.45 p.m., just as I was mounting, he appeared in my lines wearing slacks and a very downcast expression. \"Wash-out,\" he growled; \"they\u0027ve been fed and are now lying about, blown up and dead to the world.\" \"But who the devil fed them?\" I thundered. \"They fed themselves,\" said Albert Edward. \"They ate the blooming lucky dog at half-past four.\" We therefore postponed the hunt until the morrow; but cannibalism (so cannibals assure me), once indulged in, becomes as absorbing as morphia or jig-saws, and at two-fifteen the next afternoon my groom reported the beagle to have gone the way of the pug, and the pack once more dead to the world. There was nothing for it but to postpone the show yet again, and tie up each hound separately as a precaution against further orgies. However it seemed to have become a habit with them, for the moment they were unleashed on the evening of the third day they turned as one dog upon the poodle. I wiped the bloodhound\u0027s nose for him with a deft swipe of my whip lash, and Albert Edward\u0027s charger anchored the domesticated wolf by treading firmly on its tail, all of which served to give the fugitive a few seconds\u0027 start; and then a wave of mad dog dashed between our horses\u0027 legs and was on his trail screaming for gore. The poodle heard the scream and did not dally, but got him hence with promptitude and agility. He streaked across the orchard, leading by five lengths; but the good going across the park reduced his advantage. He dived through the fence hard pressed and, with the bloodhound\u0027s hot breath singeing his tail feathers, leaped into the back of a large farm-cart which happened, providentially for him, to be meandering down the broad highway. In the shafts of the cart was a sleepy fat Percheron mare. On the seat was a ponderous farmeress, upholstered in respectable black and crowned with a bead bonnet. They were probably making a sentimental excursion to the ruins of their farm. I know not; but I do know that the fat mare was suddenly shocked out of a pleasant drowse to find herself the centre of a frenzied pack of wolves, bloodhounds and other dog-hooligans, and, not liking the look of things, promptly bolted. Albert Edward and I dropped over the low hedge to see the cart disappearing down the road in a whirl of dust pursued by our vociferous harriers. The fat farmeress, her bonnet wobbling over one ear, was tugging manfully at the reins and howling to Saint Lazarus of Artois to put on the brakes. Over the tail-board protruded the head of the poodle, yelping derision at his baffled enemies. People will tell you Percherons cannot gallop; can\u0027t they? Believe me that grey mare flitted like a startled gazelle. At all events she was too good for our pack, whom we came upon a mile distant, lying on their backs in a ditch, too exhausted to do anything but put their tongues out at us, while far away we could see a small cloud of dust careering on towards the horizon. \"God help the Traffic Controlman at the next corner,\" Albert Edward mused; \"he\u0027ll never know what struck him. Well, that was pretty cheery while it lasted, what? To see that purler the Padre took over the garden-wall was alone worth the money.\" \"Oh, well, I suppose we\u0027d best herd these perishers home to kennels while they\u0027re still too weak to protest. Come on.\" \"And in the meanwhile the festive lapin breeds and breeds,\" said Albert Edward. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3294/90106.html","bookId":457,"book":{"id":457,"title":"The Mudlarks","description":"简介： When I was young, my parents sent me to a boarding school, not in any hopes of getting me educated, but because they wanted a quiet home....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3294","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:47 AM"}}
