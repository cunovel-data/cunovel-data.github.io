{"id":41771,"no":15,"title":"XV THE MULE AND THE TANK","content":"The ammunition columns on either flank provide us with plenty of amusement. They seem to live by stealing each other\u0027s mules. My line-guards tell me that stealthy figures leading shadowy donkeys are crossing to and fro all night long through my lines. The respective C.O.\u0027s, an Australian and an Irishman, drop in on us from time to time and warn us against each other. I remain strictly neutral, and so far they have respected my neutrality. I have taken steps toward this end by surrounding my horses with barbed wire and spring guns, tying bells on them and doubling the guard. Monk, the Australian, dropped in on us two or three days ago. \"That darn Sinn Feiner is the limit,\" said he; \"lifted my best moke off me last night while I was up at the batteries. He\u0027d pinch Balaam\u0027s ass.\" We murmured condolences, but Monk waved them aside. \"Oh, it\u0027s quite all right. I wasn\u0027t born yesterday, or the day before for that matter. I\u0027ll make that merry Fenian weep tears of blood before I\u0027ve finished. Just you watch.\" O\u0027Dwyer, the merry Fenian, called next day. \"Give us a dhrink, brother-officers,\" said he. \"I\u0027m wake wid laughter.\" We asked what had happened. \"Ye know that herrin\u0027-gutted bushranger over yonder? He\u0027d stale the milk out of your tea, he would, be the same token. Well, last night he got vicious and took a crack at my lines. I had rayson to suspect he\u0027d be afther tryin\u0027 somethin\u0027 on, so I laid for him. I planted a certain mule where he could stale it an\u0027 guarded the rest four deep. Begob, will ye believe me, but he fell into the thrap head first—the poor simple divil.\" \"But he got your mule,\" said Albert Edward, perplexed. \"Shure an\u0027 he did, you bet he did—he got old Lyddite.\" Albert Edward and I were still puzzled. \"Very high explosive—hence name,\" O\u0027Dwyer explained. \"Dear hearrts,\" he went on, \"he\u0027s got my stunt mule, my family assassin! That long-ear has twenty-three casualties to his credit, including a Brigadier. I have to twitch him to harness him, side-line him to groom him, throw him to clip him, and dhrug him to get him shod. Perceive the jest now? Esteemed comrade Monk is afther pinchin\u0027 an infallible packet o\u0027 sudden death, an\u0027 he don\u0027t know it—yet.\" \"What\u0027s the next move?\" I inquired. \"I\u0027m going to lave him there. Mind you I don\u0027t want to lose the old moke altogether, because, to tell the truth, I\u0027m a biteen fond of him now that I know his thricks, but I figure Mr. Monk will be a severely cured character inside a week, an\u0027 return the beastie himself with tears an\u0027 apologies on vellum so long.\" I met O\u0027Dwyer again two days later on the mud track. He reined up his cob and begged a cigarette. \"Been havin\u0027 the fun o\u0027 the worrld down at the dressin\u0027-station watchin\u0027 Monk\u0027s casualties rollin\u0027 in,\" said he. \"Terrible spectacle, \u0027nough to make a sthrong man weep. Mutual friend Monk lookin\u0027 \u0027bout as genial as a wet hen. This is goin\u0027 to be a wondherful lesson to him. See you later.\" He nudged his plump cob and ambled off, whistling merrily. But it was Monk we saw later. He wormed his long corpse into \"Mon Repos\" and sat on Albert Edward\u0027s bed laughing like a tickled hyena. \"Funniest thing on earth,\" he spluttered. \"A mule strayed into my lines t\u0027other night and refused to leave. It was a rotten beast, a holy terror; it could kick a fly off its ears and bite a man in half. I don\u0027t mind admitting it played battledore and what\u0027s-\u0027is-name with my organisation for a day or two, but out of respect for O\u0027Dwyer, blackguard though he is, I...\" \"Oh, so it was O\u0027Dwyer\u0027s mule?\" Albert Edward cut in innocently. Monk nodded hastily. \"Yes, so it turned out. Well, out of respect for O\u0027Dwyer I looked after it as far as it would allow me, naturally expecting he\u0027d come over and claim it—but he didn\u0027t. On the fourth day, after it had made a light breakfast off a bombardier\u0027s ear and kicked a gap in a farrier, I got absolutely fed up, turned the damn cannibal loose and gave it a cut with a whip for God-speed. It made off due east, cavorting and snorting until it reached the tank track; there it stopped and picked a bit of grass. Presently along comes a tank, proceeding to the fray, and gives the mule a poke in the rear. The mule lashes out, catching the tank in the chest, and then goes on with his grazing without looking round, leaving the tank for dead, as by all human standards it should have been, of course. But instead of being dead the box of tricks ups and gives the donk another butt and moves on. That roused the mule properly. He closed his eyes and laid into the tank for dear life; you could hear it clanging a mile away. \"After delivering two dozen of the best, the moke turned round to sniff the cold corpse, but the corpse was still warm and smiling. Then the mule went mad and set about the tank in earnest. He jabbed it in the eye, upper-cut it on the point, hooked it behind the ear, banged its slats, planted his left on the mark and his right on the solar plexus, but still the tank sat up and took nourishment. \"Then the donkey let a roar out of him and closed with it; tried the half Nelson, the back heel, the scissors, the roll, and the flying-mare; tried Westmorland and Cumberland style, collar and elbow, Cornish, Greece-Roman, scratch-as-scratch-can and Ju-jitsu. Nothing doing. Then as a last despairing effort he tried to charge it over on its back and rip the hide off it with his teeth. \"But the old tank gave a \u0027good-by-ee\u0027 cough of its exhaust and rumbled off as if nothing had happened, nothing at all. I have never seen such a look of surprise on any living creature\u0027s face as was on that donk\u0027s. He sank down on his tail, gave a hissing gasp and rolled over stone dead. Broken heart.\" \"Is that the end?\" Albert Edward inquired. \"It is,\" said Monk; \"and if you go outside and look half-right you\u0027ll see the bereaved Mr. O\u0027Dwyer, all got up in sackcloth, cinders and crêpe rosettes, mooning over the deceased like a dingo on an ash heap.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3294/90090.html","bookId":457,"book":{"id":457,"title":"The Mudlarks","description":"简介： When I was young, my parents sent me to a boarding school, not in any hopes of getting me educated, but because they wanted a quiet home....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3294","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:47 AM"}}
