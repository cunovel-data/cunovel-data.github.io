{"id":41781,"no":25,"title":"XXV \"FLY, GENTLE DOVE\"","content":"We were told off for a job of work over the bags not long ago. The Staff sent us some pigeons with their love, and expressed the hope that we\u0027d drop them a line from time to time and let them know how the battle was raging, and where. (The Staff live in constant terror that one day the War will walk completely away from them and some unruly platoon bomb its way up Unter den Linden without their knowing a thing about it.) Next morning we duly pushed off, and in the course of time found ourselves deep in Bocheland holding a sketchy line of outposts and waiting for the Hun to do the sporting thing and counter. More time passed, and as the Hun showed no signs of getting a move on we began to look about us and take stock. Personally I felt that a square meal might do something towards curing a hollow feeling that was gnawing me beneath the belt. As I was rummaging through my haversack the pigeon-carrier approached and asked for the book of rules. Now to the uninitiated, I have no doubt, pigeon-flying sounds the easiest game in the world. You just take a picture-postcard, mark the spot you are on with a cross, add a few words, such as, \"Hoping this finds you in the pink, as it leaves me at present—I don\u0027t think,\" insert it in the faithful fowl\u0027s beak, say, \"Home, John,\" and in a few minutes it is rattling into the General\u0027s letter-box. This is by no means the case. Pigeons are the kittlest of cattle. If you don\u0027t treat them just so they will either chuck up the game on the spot or hand your note to Hindenburg. To avoid this a book of the rules is issued to pigeon-carriers, giving instructions as to when and how the creatures should be fed, watered, exercised, etc. On this occasion I felt through my pockets for the book of the rules and drew blank. \"What\u0027s the matter with the bird, anyhow?\" I asked. \"Looks a bit dahn-\u0027earted,\" said the carrier; \"dejected-like, as you might say.\" \"Seeing you\u0027ve been carrying it upside down for the last twenty-four hours it isn\u0027t to be wondered at,\" said my Troop Sergeant; \"blood\u0027s run to its head, that\u0027s what.\" \"Turn it the other way up for a bit and run the blood back again,\" I suggested. \"Exercise is what it wants,\" said my sergeant firmly. \"By all means exercise it, then,\" said I. The carrier demurred. \"Very good, sir—but how, sir?\" \"Ask the sergeant,\" said I. \"Sergeant, how do you exercise a pigeon? Lunge it, or put it through Swedish monkey motions?\" The sergeant rubbed his chin stubble. \"Can\u0027t say I remember the official method, sir; one might take it for a walk at the end of a string, or——\" \"These official pigeons,\" I interposed, \"have got to be treated in the official manner or they won\u0027t work; their mechanism becomes deranged. We had a pigeon at the Umpteenth Battle of Wipers and upset it somehow. Anyway, when we told it to buzz off and fetch reinforcements, it sat on a tree licking its fluff and singing, and we had to throw mud at it to get it to shift. Where it went to then goodness only knows, for it has never been seen since. I am going to do the right thing by this bird.\" I thereupon sent a galloper to the next outpost, occupied by the Babe and Co., asking him the official recipe for exercising pigeons. The answer came back as follows:— \"Ask Albert Edward. All I know about \u0027em is that you mustn\u0027t discharge birds of opposite sex together as they stop and flirt. P.S.—You haven\u0027t got such a thing as a bit of cold pudden about you, guv\u0027nor, have you? I\u0027m all in.\" I sent the galloper galloping on to Albert Edward\u0027s post. \"Don\u0027t discharge birds after sunset,\" ran his reply; \"they\u0027re afraid to go home in the dark—that\u0027s all I recollect. Ask the Skipper. P.S.—Got a bit of bully beef going spare? I\u0027m tucked up something terrible.\" I sighed and sent my messenger on to the Skipper, inquiring the official method of exercising pigeons. Half an hour later his answer reached me— \"Don\u0027t know. Try eating \u0027em. That\u0027s what I\u0027m doing with mine.\" While on the subject of carrier-pigeons, I may mention that one winter night I was summoned to Corps H.Q. Said a Red Hat: \"We are going to be rude to the Boche at dawn and we want you to go over with the boys. When you reach your objectives just drop us a pigeon to say so. Here\u0027s a chit, take it to the pigeon loft and get a good nippy fowl. Good night and good luck.\" I found the pigeon-fancier inside an old London omnibus which served for a pigeon-loft, spoon-feeding a sick bird. A dour Lancastrian, the fancier studied my chit with a sour eye, then, grumbling that he didn\u0027t know what the army was coming to turning birds out of bed at this hour, he slowly climbed a ladder and, poking his head through a trap in the roof, addressed himself to the pigeons. \"That you, Flossie? No, you can\u0027t go with them tail feathers missing to the General\u0027s cat. Jellicoe—no, you can\u0027t go neither, you\u0027ve \u0027ad a \u0027ard day out with them tanks. Nasty cough you\u0027ve got, Gaby; I\u0027ll give you a drop of \u0027ot for it presently. You\u0027re breathin\u0027 very \u0027eavy, Joffre; been over-eatin\u0027 yourself again, I suppose—couldn\u0027t fly a yard. Eustace, you\u0027re for it.\" He backed down the ladder, grasping the unfortunate Eustace, stuffed it in a basket and handed it to me. \"I hope this is a good bird,\" said I, \"nippy and all that?\" The fancier snorted, \"Good bird? Nothing can\u0027t stop \u0027im, barrages, smoke, nothing. \u0027E\u0027s deserved the V.C. scores of times over; \u0027e\u0027s the best bird in the army, an\u0027 don\u0027t you forget it, sir.\" I promised not to, caught up the basket and fled. I reached the neighbourhood of the line at about 2 a.m. It was snowing hard and the whole front was sugared over like a wedding-cake, every track and landmark obliterated. For some hours I groped about seeking Battalion H.Q., tripping over hidden wire, toboganning down snow-masked craters into icy shell-holes, the inimitable Eustace with me. Finally I fell head-first into a dug-out inhabited by three ancient warriors, who were sitting round a brazier sucking cigarettes. They were Brigade Scouts, they told me, and were going over presently. They were also Good Samaritans, one of them, Fred, giving me his seat by the fire and a mug of scalding cocoa, while his colleagues, Messrs. Alf and Bert, attended to Eustace, who needed all the attention he could get. I caught snatches of their conversation here and there: \"Shall us toast \u0027im over the brazier a bit, Alf?\" \"Wonder if a drop o\u0027 rum would \u0027earten \u0027im?\" \"Tip it into his jaws when \u0027e yawns, Bert.\" At length Eustace\u0027s circulation was declared restored and the three set about harnessing themselves for the war, encasing their legs in sand-bags, winding endless mufflers round their heads and donning innumerable odd overcoats, so that their final appearance was more that of apple-women than scouts. We then set out for the battle, Bert leading the way towards the barrage which was cracking and banging away in yellow flashes over the Boche lines. Presently we heard a muffled hail ahead. \"Wazzermatter, Bert?\" Alf shouted. \"They\u0027ve quit—slung their \u0027ook,\" came the voice. Fifty yards brought us bumping up against Bert, who was prodding through the débris of a German post with the point of his bayonet. \"So the swines have beat it?\" said Fred. \"Any soovenirs?\" \"Nah!\" said Bert, spitting, \"not a blinkin\u0027 \u0027am-sandwich.\" \"Is this really our objective?\" I asked. \"It is, sir,\" Bert replied. \"Best sit down and keep quiet; the rest of the boys will be along in a jiffy, and they\u0027d bomb their own grandmothers when they\u0027re worked up.\" I put my hand in the basket and dragged Eustace forth. He didn\u0027t look up to V.C. form. Still I had explicit orders to release him when our objective was reached, and obedience is second nature with me. I secured my message to his leg, wished him luck and tossed him high in the air. A swirl of snow hid him from view. I didn\u0027t call at H.Q. when I returned. I went straight home to bed and stayed there. As they did not send for me and I heard no more about it I conjectured that the infallible Eustace had got back to his bus and all was well. Nevertheless I had a sort of uneasy feeling about him. I heard no more of it for ten days, and then, out walking one afternoon, I bumped into the pigeon-fancier. There was no way of avoiding the man; the lane was only four feet wide, bounded by nine-foot walls with glass on top. So I halted opposite him, smiled my prettiest and asked after Eustace. \"So glad he got home all right,\" said I; \"a great bird that.\" The fancier glared at me, his sour eyes sparkling, his fists opening and shutting. I felt that only bitter discipline stood between them and my throat. \"Ay, sir,\" said he, speaking with difficulty, \"he\u0027s a great bird, but not the bird he was. He got home all right yesterday, but very stiff in the legs from walking every step o\u0027 the way.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3294/90100.html","bookId":457,"book":{"id":457,"title":"The Mudlarks","description":"简介： When I was young, my parents sent me to a boarding school, not in any hopes of getting me educated, but because they wanted a quiet home....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3294","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:47 AM"}}
