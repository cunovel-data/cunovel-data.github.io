{"id":41763,"no":7,"title":"VII THE RIDING-MASTER","content":"The scene is a School of Instruction at the back of the Western Front set in a valley of green meadows bordered by files of plumy poplars, and threaded through by a silver ribbon of water. On the lazy afternoon breeze come the concerted yells of a bayonet class, practising frightfulness further down the valley; also the staccato chatter of Lewis guns punching holes in the near hillside. In the centre of one meadow is a turf manège. In the centre of the manège stands the villain of the piece, the Riding-Master. He wears a crown on his sleeve, tight breeches, jackboots, vicious spurs and sable moustachios. His right hand toys with a long, long whip, his left with his sable moustachios. He looks like Diavolo, the lion-tamer, about to put his man-eating chums through hoops of fire. His victims, a dozen infantry officers, circle slowly round the manège. They are mounted on disillusioned cavalry horses who came out with Wellington and know a thing or two. Now and again they wink at the Riding-Master and he winks back at them. The audience consists of an ancient Gaul in picturesque blue pants, whose mètier is to totter round the meadows brushing flies off a piebald cow; the School Padre, who keeps at long range so that he may see the sport without hearing the language, and ten little gamins, who have been splashing in the silver stream and are now sitting drying on the bank like ten little toads. They come every afternoon, for never have they seen such fun, never since the great days before the War when the circus with the boxing kangaroo and the educated porks came to town. Suddenly the Riding-Master clears his throat. At the sound thereof the horses cock their ears and their riders grab handfulls of leather and hair. R.-M. \"Now, gentlemen, mind the word. Gently away—tra-a-a-at.\" The horses break into a slow jog-trot and the cavaliers into a cold perspiration. The ten little gamins cheer delightedly. R.-M. \"Sit down, sit up, \u0027ollow yer backs, keep the hands down, backs foremost, even pace. Number Two, Sir, \u0027ollow yer back; don\u0027t sit \u0027unched up like you\u0027d over-ate yourself. Number Seven, don\u0027t throw yerself about in that drunken manner, you\u0027ll miss the saddle altogether presently, coming down—can\u0027t expect the \u0027orse to catch you every time. \"Number Three, don\u0027t flap yer helbows like an \u0027en; you ain\u0027t laid an hegg, \u0027ave you? \"\u0027Ollow yer backs, \u0027eads up, \u0027eels down; four feet from nose to croup. \"Number One, keep yer feet back, you\u0027ll be kickin\u0027 that mare\u0027s teeth out, you will. \"Come down off \u0027is \u0027ead, Number Seven; this ain\u0027t a monkey-\u0027ouse. \"Keep a light an\u0027 even feelin\u0027 of both reins, backs of the \u0027ands foremost, four feet from nose to croup. \"Leggo that mare\u0027s tail, Number Seven; you\u0027re goin\u0027, not comin\u0027, and any\u0027ow that mare likes to keep \u0027er tail to \u0027erself. You\u0027ve upset \u0027er now, the tears is fair streamin\u0027 down \u0027er face—\u0027ave a bit of feelin\u0027 for a pore dumb beast. \"\u0027Ollow yer backs, even pace, grip with the knees, shorten yer reins, four feet from nose to croup. Number Eight, restrain yerself, me lad, restrain yerself, you ain\u0027t shadow-sparrin\u0027, you know. \"You too, Number Nine; if you don\u0027t calm yer action a bit you\u0027ll burst somethin\u0027. \"Now, remember, a light feelin\u0027 of the right rein and pressure of the left leg. Ride—wa-a-alk! Ri\u0027—tur-r-rn! \u0027Alt—\u0027pare to s\u0027mount—s\u0027mount! Dismount, I said, Number Five; that means get down. No, don\u0027t dismount on the flat of yer back, me lad, it don\u0027t look nice. Try to remember you\u0027re an horfficer and be more dignified. \"Now listen to me while I enumerate the parts of a norse in language so simple any bloomin\u0027 fool can understand. This\u0027ll be useful to you, for if you ever \u0027ave a norse to deal with and he loses one of \u0027is parts you\u0027ll know \u0027ow to indent for a new one. \"The \u0027orse \u0027as two ends, a fore-end—so called from its tendency to go first, and an \u0027ind-end or rear rank. The \u0027orse is provided with two legs at each end, which can be easily distinguished, the fore legs being straight and the \u0027ind legs \u0027avin\u0027 kinks in \u0027em. \"As the \u0027orse does seventy-five per cent of \u0027is dirty work with \u0027is \u0027ind-legs it is advisable to keep clear of \u0027em, rail \u0027em off or strap boxing-gloves on \u0027em. The legs of the \u0027orse is very delicate and liable to crock up, so do not try to trim off any unsightly knobs that may appear on them with a hand-axe—a little of that \u0027as been known to sour a norse for good. \"Next we come to the \u0027ead. On the south side of the \u0027ead we discover the mouth. The \u0027orse\u0027s mouth was constructed for mincing \u0027is victuals, also for \u0027is rider to \u0027ang on by. As the \u0027orse does the other forty-five per cent of \u0027is dirty work with \u0027is mouth it is advisable to stand clear of that as well. In fact, what with his mouth at one end and \u0027is \u0027ind-legs at t\u0027other, the middle of the \u0027orse is about the only safe spot, and that is why we place the saddle there. Everything in the Harmy is done with a reason, gentlemen. \"And now, Number ten, tell me what coloured \u0027orse you are ridin\u0027? \"A chestnut? No, \u0027e ain\u0027t no chestnut and never was, no, nor a raspberry roan neither; \u0027e\u0027s a bay. \u0027Ow often must I tell you that a chestnut \u0027orse is the colour of lager beer, a brown \u0027orse the colour of draught ale, and a black \u0027orse the colour of stout. \"And now, gentlemen, stan\u0027 to yer \u0027orses, \u0027pare to mount—mount! \"There you go, Number Seven, up one side and down the other. Try to stop in the saddle for a minute if only for the view. You\u0027ll get yourself \u0027urted one of these days dashing about all over the \u0027orse like that; and s\u0027posing you was to break your neck, who\u0027d get into trouble? Me, not you. \u0027Ave a bit of consideration for other people, please. \"Now mind the word. Ride—ri\u0027—tur-r-rn. Walk march. Tr-a-a-at. Helbows slightly brushing the ribs—your ribs, not the \u0027orse\u0027s, Number Three. \"Shorten yer reins, \u0027eels down, \u0027eads up, \u0027ollow yer backs, four feet from nose to croup. \"Get off that mare\u0027s neck, Number Seven, and try ridin\u0027 in the saddle for a change; it\u0027ll be more comfortable for everybody. \"You oughter do cowboy stunts for the movin\u0027 pictures, Number Six, you ought really. People would pay money to see you ride a norse upside down like that. Got a strain of wild Cossack blood in you, eh? \"There you are, now you\u0027ve been and fell off. Nice way to repay me for all the patience an\u0027 learning I\u0027ve given you! \"What are you lyin\u0027 there for? Day dreaming? I s\u0027pose you\u0027re goin\u0027 to tell me you\u0027re \u0027urted now? Be writing \u0027ome to Mother about it next: \u0027Dear Ma,—A mad mustang \u0027as trod on me stummick. Please send me a gold stripe. Your loving child, Algy.\u0027 \"Now mind the word. Ride—can—ter!\" He cracks his whip; the horses throw up their heads and break into a canter; the cavaliers turn pea-green about the chops, let go the reins and clutch saddle-pommels. The leading horse, a rakish chestnut, finding his head free at last and being heartily fed-up with the whole business, suddenly bolts out of the manège and legs it across the meadow, en route for stables and tea. His eleven mates stream in his wake, emptying saddles as they go. The ten little gamins dance ecstatically upon the bank, waving their shirts and shrilling \"A Berlin! A Berlin!\" The ancient Gaul props himself up against the piebald cow and shakes his ancient head. \"C\u0027est la guerre,\" he croaks. The deserted Riding-Master damns his eyes and blesses his soul for a few moments; then sighs resignedly, takes a cigarette from his cap lining, lights it and waddles off towards the village and his favourite estaminet. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3294/90082.html","bookId":457,"book":{"id":457,"title":"The Mudlarks","description":"简介： When I was young, my parents sent me to a boarding school, not in any hopes of getting me educated, but because they wanted a quiet home....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3294","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:47 AM"}}
