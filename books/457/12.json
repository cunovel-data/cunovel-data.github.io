{"id":41768,"no":12,"title":"XII FUNNY CUTS","content":"All the world has marvelled at \"the irrepressible good humour\" of old Atkins. Every distinguished tripper who comes Cook\u0027s touring to the Front for a couple of days devotes at least a chapter of his resultant book to it. \"How in thunder does Thomas do it?\" they ask. \"What the mischief does he find to laugh at?\" Listen. Years ago, when the well-known War was young, a great man sat in his sanctum exercising his grey matter. He said to himself, \"There is a war on. Men, amounting to several, will be prised loose from comfortable surroundings and condemned to get on with it for the term of their unnatural lives. They will be shelled, gassed, mined and bombed, smothered in mud, worked to the bone, bored stiff and scared silly. Fatigues will be unending, rations short, rum diluted, reliefs late and leave nil. Their girls will forsake them for diamond-studded munitioneers. Their wives will write saying, \u0027Little Jimmie has the mumps; and what about the rent? You aren\u0027t spending all of five bob a week on yourself, are you?\u0027 This is but a tithe (or else a tittle) of the things that will occur to them, and their sunny natures will sour and sicken if something isn\u0027t done about it.\" The great man sat up all night chewing penholders and pondering on the problem. The Big Idea came with the end of the eighth penholder. He sprang to his feet, fires of inspiration flashing from his eyes, and boomed, \"Let there be Funny Cuts!\"—then went to bed. Next morning he created \"I.\" (which stands for Intelligence), carefully selected his Staff, arrayed them in tabs of appropriate hue, and told them to go the limit. And they have been going it faithfully ever since. What the Marines are to the Senior Service, \"I.\" is to us. Should a Subaltern come in with the yarn that the spook of Hindenburg accosted him at Bloody Corner and offered him a cigar, or a balloon cherub buttonhole you with the story of a Boche tank fitted with rubber tyres, C-springs and hot and cold water, that he has seen climbing trees behind St. Quentin, we retort, \"Oh, go and tell it to \u0027I.\u0027\" and then sit back and see what the inspired official organ of the green tabs will make of it. A hint is as good as a wink to them, a nudge ample. Under the genius of these imaginative artists the most trivial incident bourgeons forth into a Le Queux spell-binder, and the whole British Army, mustering about its Sergeant-Majors, gets selected cameos read to it every morning at roll-call, laughs brokenly into the jaws of dawn and continues chuckling to itself all day. Now you know. Our Adjutant had a telephone call not long ago. \"Army speaking,\" said a voice. \"Will you send somebody over to Courcelles and see if there is a Town Major there?\" The Adjutant said he would, and a N.C.O. was despatched forthwith. He returned later, reporting no symptoms of one, so the Adjutant rang up Exchange and asked to be hooked on to Army Headquarters. \"Which branch?\" Exchange inquired. \"Why, really I don\u0027t know—forgot to ask,\" the Adjutant confessed. \"I\u0027ll have a try at \u0027A.\u0027\u0027 \"Hello,\" said \"A.\" \"There is no Town Major at Courcelles,\" said the Adjutant. \"You astound me, Fair Unknown,\" said \"A.\"; \"but what about it, anyway?\" The Adjutant apologised and asked Exchange for \"Q.\" department, \"Hello,\" said \"Q.\" \"There is no Town Major at Courcelles,\" said the Adjutant. \"Sorry, old thing, whoever you are,\" said \"Q.,\" \"but we don\u0027t stock \u0027em. Rations, iron; perspirators, box; oil, whale, delivered with promptitude and civility, but not Town Majors—sorry.\" The Adjutant sighed and consulted with Exchange as to who possibly could have rung him up. Exchange couldn\u0027t guess unless it was \"I.\"—no harm in trying, anyhow. \"Hello!\" said \"I.\" \"There is no Town Major at Courcelles,\" the Adjutant droned somewhat wearily. \"Wha-t!\" \"I.\" exclaimed, suddenly interested. \"Say it again, clearer.\" \"Cour-celles—No—Town—Major,\" the Adjutant repeated. There was a pause; then he heard the somebody give off an awed \"Good Lord!\" and drop the receiver. Next morning in Funny Cuts (the organ of Intelligence) we learned that \"Corps Headquarters was heavily Shelled last night. The Town Major is missing. This is evidence that the enemy has brought long-range guns into the opposite sector.\" Followed masses of information as to the probable make of the guns, the size of shell they preferred, the life-story of the Battery Commander, his favourite flower and author. The Boche, always on the alert to snaffle the paying devices of an opposition firm, now has his \"I.\" staff and Funny Cuts as well. From time to time we capture a copy and read this sort of thing: \"From agonised screeches heard by one of our intrepid airmen while patrolling over the enemy\u0027s lines yesterday, it is evident that the brutal and relentless British are bayoneting their prisoners.\" A Highland Division, whose star pipers were holding a dirge and lament contest on that date, are now ticking off the hours to the next offensive. The Antrims had a cordon bleu by the name of Michael O\u0027Callagan. He was a sturdy rogue, having retreated all the way from Mons, and subsequently advanced all the way back to the Yser with a huge stock-pot on his back, from which he had furnished mysterious stews to all comers, at all hours, under any conditions. For this, and for the fact that he could cook under water, and would turn out hot meals when other chefs were committing suicide, much was forgiven him, but he was prone to look upon the vin when it was rouge and was habitually coated an inch thick with a varnish of soot and pot-black. One morning he calmly hove himself over the parapet and, in spite of the earnest attentions of Hun snipers, remained there long enough to collect sufficient débris to boil his dixies. Next day the Boche Funny Cuts flared forth scareheads: \"SAVAGES ON THE SOMME. \"The desperate and unprincipled British are employing black cannibal Zulus in the defence of their system. Yesterday one of them, a chief of incredibly depraved appearance, was observed scouting in the open.\" The communiqué ended with a treatise on the Zulu, its black man-eating habits, and an exhortation to \"our old Brandenburgers\" not to be dismayed.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3294/90087.html","bookId":457,"book":{"id":457,"title":"The Mudlarks","description":"简介： When I was young, my parents sent me to a boarding school, not in any hopes of getting me educated, but because they wanted a quiet home....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3294","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:47 AM"}}
