{"id":41786,"no":30,"title":"XIX A REST CURE","content":"Not long ago a notice appeared in Part II Orders to the effect that our Army had established a Rest Home at X where invalid officers might be sent for a week\u0027s recuperation. Now X is a very pleasant place, consisting of a crowd of doll\u0027s-house chalets set between cool pine-woods and the sea. The chalets are labelled variously \"Villa des Roses,\" \"Les Hirondelles,\" \"Sans Souci,\" and so on, and in the summertimes of happier years swarmed with comfortable bourgeois, bare-legged children and Breton nannas; but in these stern days a board above the gate of \"Villa des Roses\" announces that the Assistant-Director of Agriculture may be found within meditating on the mustard-and-cress crop, while \"Les Hirondelles\" and \"Sans Souci\" harbour respectively the Base Press Censor (whose tar-brush hovered over this perfectly priceless article) and a platoon of the D.L.O.L.R.R.V.R. (Duchess of Loamshire\u0027s Own Ladies\u0027 Rabbit Rearing Volunteer Reserve). X, as I said before, is an exceedingly pleasant place; you may lean out of the window o\u0027 mornings and watch the D.L.O.L.R.R.V.R.\u0027s Sergeant-Majoress putting her platoon through Swedish monkey motions, and in the afternoons you can recline on the sands and watch them sporting in the glad sea-waves (telescopes protruding from the upper windows of \"Villa des Roses\" and \"Sans Souci\" suggesting that the A.D.A. and the B.P.C. are similarly employed). The between-whiles may be spent lapping up ozone from the sea, resin from the pine-woods, and champagne cocktails which Marie-Louise mixes so cunningly in the little caf√© round the corner; and what with one thing and another the invalid officer goes pig-jumping back to the line fit to mince whole brigades of Huns with his bare teeth. X, you will understand, is a very admirable institution, and when we heard about this Rest Home we were all for it and tried to cultivate fur on the tongue, capped hocks and cerebral meningitis; but the Skipper hardened his heart against us and there was nothing doing. Then one morning MacTavish came over all dithery-like in the lines, fell up against a post, smashed his wrist-watch and would have brained himself had that been possible. He picked himself up, apologised for making a fool of himself before the horses, patched his scalp with plaster from his respirator, borrowed my reserve watch \"Pretty Polly,\" and carried on. \"Pretty Polly\" can do two laps to any other watch\u0027s one without turning a hair-spring. Externally she looks very much like any other mechanical pup the Ordnance sells you for eleven francs net; her secret lies in her spring, which, I imagine, must have been intended for \"Big Ben,\" but sprang into the wrong chassis by mistake. At all events as soon as it is wound up it lashes out left and right with such violence that the whole machine leaps with the shock of its internal strife and hops about on the table after the manner of a Mexican dancing bean, clucking like an ostrich that has laid twins. It will be gathered that my \"Pretty Polly\" is not the ultimate syllable in the way of accuracy, but as MacTavish seemed to want her and had been kind to me in the way of polo-sticks, I handed her over without a murmur. The same afternoon MacTavish came over dithery again, dived into a heap of bricks and knocked himself out for the full count. We put him to bed and signalled the Vet. The Vet reported that MacTavish\u0027s temperature was well above par and booming. He went on to state that MacTavish was suffering from P.U.O. (which is Spanish for \"flu\") and that he probably wouldn\u0027t weather the night. The Skipper promptly \u0027phoned O.C. Burials, inviting him to dine next evening, and Albert Edward wired his tailor, asking what was being worn in headstones. William, our Mess President, took up a position by the sick man\u0027s side in hopes he would regain consciousness for long enough to settle his mess-bill, and the rest of us spent the evening recalling memories of poor old Mac, his many sterling qualities, etc. However, next morning a batman poked his head into the Mess and said could Mr. MacTavish have a little whisky, please, he was fancying it, and anyway you couldn\u0027t force none of that there grool down him not if you was to use a drenching bit. At noon the batman was back to say that Mr. MacTavish was fancying a cigarette now, also a loan of the gramophone and a few cheerful records. The Skipper promptly \u0027phoned postponing O.C. Burials, and Albert Edward wired his tailor, changing his order to that of a canary waistcoat. That evening MacTavish tottered into the Mess and managed to surround a little soup, a brace of cutlets and a bottle of white wine without coming over dithery again. But for all that he was not looking his best; he weaved in his walk, his eye was dull, his nose hot, his ear cold and drooping, and the Skipper, gazing upon him, remembered the passage in Part II Orders and straightway sat down and applied that MacTavish be sent to X at once, adding such a graphic pen-picture of the invalid (most of it copied from a testimonial to somebody\u0027s backache pills) as to reduce us to tears and send MacTavish back to his bed badly shaken to hear how ill he\u0027d been. The Skipper despatched his pen-picture to H.Q. and forgot all about it, and so did H.Q. apparently, for we heard nothing further, and in due course forgot all about it ourselves, and in the meanwhile MacTavish got back into form, and MacTavish in form is no shrinking lily be it said. He has a figure which tests every stitch in his Sam Browne, a bright blue eye and a complexion which an external application of mixed weather and an internal application of tawny port has painted the hue of the beetroot. Then suddenly, like a bomb from the blue, an ambulance panted up to the door and presented a H.Q. chit to the effect that the body of MacTavish be delivered to it at once to bear off to X. The Skipper at the time was out hacking and Albert Edward was in charge; he sent an orderly flying to MacTavish, who rolled in from his tent singing \"My Friend John\" at the top of his voice and looking more like an over-fed beetroot than ever. \"Dash it all, I don\u0027t want to go to their confounded mortuary,\" he shouted; \"never felt fitter in my life. I can\u0027t go; I won\u0027t go!\" \"You\u0027ll have to,\" said Albert Edward; \"can\u0027t let the Skipper down after that pen-picture he wrote; the Staff would never believe another word he said. No, MacTavish, my son, you\u0027ll have to play the game and go.\" \"But, you ass, look at him,\" wailed the Babe; \"look at his ruddy, ruby, tomato-ketchup, plum-and-apple complexion. What are you going to do about that?\" \"I\u0027ll settle his complexion,\" replied Albert Edward grimly; \"tell his man to toss his tooth-brush into the meat-waggon; and you, Mac, come with me.\" He led the violently protesting MacTavish into the kitchen. The cook tells me Albert Edward pounded two handfuls of flour into MacTavish\u0027s complexion and filled his eye-sockets up with coal-dust, and I quite believe the cook, for in five minutes\u0027 time I came on Albert Edward dragging what I at first took to be the body of a dead Pierrot down the passage towards the waiting ambulance, at the same time exhorting it to play the game and wobble for the Skipper\u0027s sake. The wretched MacTavish, choking with flour and blinded with coal-dust, wobbled like a Clydesdale with the staggers. I saw a scared R.A.M.C. orderly bound out of the car and assist Albert Edward to hoist MacTavish aboard, trip him up and pin him down on a stretcher. Then the ambulance coughed swiftly out of sight. The allotted week passed but no MacTavish came bounding back to us like a giant refreshed with great draughts of resin, and we grew anxious; which anxiety did not abate when, in reply to the Skipper\u0027s inquiries, the Rest Home authorities wired denying all knowledge of him. Goodness knows what we should have done if a letter from MacTavish himself had not arrived next morning, to say that he had lain on his back in the ambulance digging coal-dust out of his eyes and coughing up flour till the car stopped, not, to his surprise, at the Rest Home, but at a Casualty Clearing Station. Some snuffling R.A.M.C. orderlies bore him tenderly to a tent and a doctor entered, also snuffling. MacTavish is of the opinion that the whole of the medical staff had P.U.O., and the doctor was the sickest of the lot and far from reliable. At all events, on seeing MacTavish\u0027s face, he ejaculated a bronchial \"Good Lord!\" and tearing MacTavish\u0027s tunic open, stuck a trumpet against his tummy and listened for the ticks. Apparently he heard something sensational, for he wheezed another \"Good Lord!\" and decorated MacTavish with a scarlet label. Within an hour our hero found himself on board a Red Cross train en route for the coast. There were a lot of cheerful wounded on the bus, getting all the soup and jelly they wanted; but MacTavish got only lukewarm milk and precious little of that. From scraps of hushed conversation he caught here and there he gathered that his life hung by a thread. He was feeling very bewildered and depressed, he said, but, remembering his duty to the Skipper, played the game and kept body and soul together on drips of jelly surreptitiously begged from the cheerful wounded. Next morning he found himself in hospital in England, where he still remains. He says he has been promoted from warm milk to cold slops, but is still liable to die at any moment, he understands. He has discovered that he was sent home with \"galloping heart disease,\" but nobody in the hospital can get even a trot out of it, and boards of learned physicians sit on him all day long, their trumpets planted on his tummy listening for the ticks. MacTavish says he thinks it improbable that they ever will hear any ticks now, for the excellent reason that he threw the cause thereof‚Äîmy \"Pretty Polly,\" to wit‚Äîout of the window the day he arrived. In a postscript he adds that he considers he has played the game far enough, and that if the Skipper doesn\u0027t come and bail him out soon he\u0027ll bite the learned physicians, kiss the nurses, sing \"My Friend John\" and disgrace the Regiment for ever. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3294/90105.html","bookId":457,"book":{"id":457,"title":"The Mudlarks","description":"ÁÆÄ‰ªãÔºö When I was young, my parents sent me to a boarding school, not in any hopes of getting me educated, but because they wanted a quiet home....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3294","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:47 AM"}}
