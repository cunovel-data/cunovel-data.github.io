{"id":41762,"no":6,"title":"VI THE PADRE","content":"You have all seen it in the latest V.C. list—\"The Reverend Paul Grayne, Chaplain to the Forces, for conspicuous bravery and gallant example in the face of desperate circumstances.\" You have all pictured him, the beau-ideal of muscular Christian, the Fighting Parson, eighteen hands high, terrific in wind and limb, with a golden mane and a Greek profile; a Pekinese in the drawing-room, a bulldog in the arena; a soup?on of Saint Francis with a dash of John L. Sullivan—and all that. But we who have met heroes know that they are very seldom of the type which achieves the immortality of the picture post card. The stalwart with pearly teeth, lilac eyes and curly lashes is C3 at Lloyd\u0027s (Sir Francis), and may be heard twice daily at the Frivolity singing, \"My Goo-goo Girl from Honolulu\" to entranced flappers; while the lad who has Fritzie D. Hun backed on the ropes, clinching for time, is usually gifted with bow legs, freckles, a dented proboscis and a coiffure after the manner of a wire-haired terrier. The Reverend Paul Grayne, v.c., sometime curate of Thorpington Parva, in the county of Hampshire, was no exception to this rule. ?sthetically he was a blot on the landscape; among all the heroes I have met I never saw anything less heroically moulded. He stood about five feet nought and tipped the beam at seven stone nothing. He had a mild chinless face, and his long beaky nose, round large spectacles, and trick of cocking his head sideways when conversing, gave him the appearance of an intelligent little dicky-bird. I remember very well the occasion of our first meeting. I was in my troop lines one afternoon, blackguarding a farrier, when a loud nicker sounded on the road and a black cob, bearing a feebly protesting Padre upon his fat back, trotted through the gate, up to the lines and began to swop How d\u0027y\u0027 do\u0027s with my hairies. The little Padre cocked his head on one side and oozed apologies from every pore. He hadn\u0027t meant to intrude, he twittered; Peter had brought him; it was Peter\u0027s fault; Peter was very eccentric. Peter, I gathered, was the fat cob, who by this time had butted into the lines and was tearing at a hay net as if he hadn\u0027t had a meal for years. His alleged master looked at me hopeless, helpless. What was he to do? \"Well, since Peter is evidently stopping to tea with my horses,\" said I, \"the only thing you can do is to come to tea with us.\" So I lifted him down and bore him off to the cowshed inhabited by our mess at the time and regaled him on chlorinated Mazawattee, marmalade and dog biscuit. An hour later, Peter willing, he left us. We saw a lot of the Padre after that. Peter, it appeared, had taken quite a fancy to us and frequently brought him round to meals. The Padre had no word of say in the matter. He confessed that, when he embarked upon Peter in the morning, he had not the vaguest idea where mid-day would find him. Nothing but the black cob\u0027s fortunate rule of going home to supper saved the Padre from being posted as a deserter. He had an uneasy feeling that Peter would one day suddenly sicken of the War and that he would find himself in Paris or on the Riviera. We had an uneasy feeling that Peter would one day develop a curiosity as to the Boche horse rations, and stroll across the line, and we should lose the Padre, a thing we could ill afford to do, for by this time he had taken us under his wing spiritually and bodily. On Sundays he would appear in our midst dragging a folding harmonium and hold Church Parade, leading the hymns in his twittering bird-like voice. Then the spinster ladies of his old parish of Thorpington Parva gave him a Ford car, and with this he scoured back areas for provisions and threaded his tin buggy in and out of columns of dusty infantry and clattering ammunition limbers, spectacles gleaming, cap slightly awry, while his batman (a wag) perched precariously atop of a rocking pile of biscuit tins, cigarette cases and boxes of tinned fruit, and shouted after the fashion of railway porters, \"By your leave! Fags for the firin\u0027 line. Way for the Woodbine Express.\" But if we saw a lot of the Padre it was the Antrims who looked upon him as their special property. They were line infantry, of the type which gets most of the work and none of the Press notices, a hard-bitten, unregenerate crowd, who cared not a whit whether Belgium bled or not, but loved fighting for its own sake and put their faith in bayonet and butt. And wherever these Antrims went, thither went the Padre also, harmonium and his Woodbines. I have a story that, when they were in a certain part of the line where the trenches were only thirty yards apart (so close indeed that the opposing forces greeted each other by their first names and borrowed one another\u0027s wiring tools), the Padre dragged the harmonium into the front line and held service there, and the Germans over the way joined lustily in the hymns. He kept the men of the Antrims going on canteen delicacies and their officers in a constant bubble of joy. He swallowed their tall stories without a gulp; they pulled one leg and he offered the other; he fell headlong into every silly trap they set for him. Also they achieved merit in other messes by peddling yarns of his wonderful innocence and his incredible absent-mindedness. \"Came to me yesterday, the Dicky Bird did,\" one of them would relate; \"wanted advice about that fat fraud of his, Peter. \u0027He\u0027s got an abrasion on the knob of his right-hand front paw,\u0027 says he. \u0027Dicky Bird,\u0027 says I, \u0027that is no way to describe the anatomy of a horse after all the teaching I\u0027ve given you.\u0027 \u0027I am so forgetful and horsy terms are so confusing,\u0027 he moans. \u0027Oh, I recollect now—his starboard ankle!\u0027 The dear babe!\" In the course of time the Antrims went into the Push, but on this occasion they refused to take the Padre with them, explaining that Pushes were noisy affairs, with messy accidents happening in even the best regulated battalions. The Padre was up at midnight to see them go, his spectacles misty. They went over the bags at dawn, reached their objective in twenty minutes and scratched themselves in. The Padre rejoined them ten minutes later, very badly winded, but bringing a case of Woodbines along with him. My friend Patrick grabbed him by the leg and dragged him into a shell-hole. Nothing but an inherent respect for his cloth restrained Patrick from giving the Dicky Bird the spanking of his life. At 8 a.m. the Hun countered heavily and hove the Antrims out. Patrick retreated in good order, leading the Padre by an ear. The Antrims sat down, licked their cuts, puffed some of the Woodbines, then went back and pitchforked the Boche in his tender spots. The Boche collected fresh help and bobbed up again. Business continued brisk all day, and when night fell the Antrims were left masters of the position. At 1 a.m. they were relieved by the Rutland Rifles, and a dog-weary battered remnant of the battalion crawled back to camp in a sunken road a mile in the rear. One or two found bivouacs left by the Rutlands, but the majority dropped where they halted. My friend Patrick found a bivouac, wormed into it and went to sleep. The next thing he remembers was the roof of his abode caving in with the weight of two men struggling violently. Patrick extricated himself somehow and rolled out into the grey dawn to find the sunken road filled with grey figures, in among the bivouacs and shell-holes, stabbing at the sleeping Antrims. Here and there men were locked together, struggling tooth and claw; the air was vibrant with a ghastly pandemonium of grunts and shrieks; the sunken road ran like a slaughter-house gutter. There was only one thing to do, and that was to get out, so Patrick did so, driving before him what men he could collect. A man staggered past him, blowing like a walrus. It was the Padre\u0027s batman, and he had his master tucked under one arm, in his underclothes, kicking feebly. Patrick halted his men beyond the hill crest, and there the Colonel joined him, trotting on his stockinged feet. Other officers arrived, herding men. \"They must have rushed the Ruts., Sir,\" Patrick panted; \"must be after those guns just behind us.\" \"They\u0027ll get \u0027em too,\" said the Colonel grimly. \"We can\u0027t stop \u0027em,\" said the Senior Captain. \"If we counter at once we might give the Loamshires time to come up—they\u0027re in support, Sir—but—but, if they attack us, they\u0027ll get those guns—run right over us.\" The Colonel nodded. \"Man, I know, I know; but look at \u0027em\"—he pointed to the pathetic remnant of his battalion lying out behind the crest—\"they\u0027re dropping asleep where they lie—they\u0027re beat to a finish—not another kick left in \u0027em.\" He sat down and buried his face in his hands. The redoubtable Antrims had come to the end. Suddenly came a shout from the Senior Captain, \"Good Lord, what\u0027s that fellow after? Who the devil is it?\" They all turned and saw a tiny figure, clad only in underclothes, marching deliberately over the ridge towards the Germans. \"Who is it?\" the Colonel repeated. \"Beggin\u0027 your pardon, the Reverend, Sir,\" said the Padre\u0027s batman as he strode past the group of officers. \"\u0027E give me the slip, Sir. Gawd knows wot \u0027e\u0027s up to now.\" He lifted up his voice and wailed after his master, \"\u0027Ere, you come back this minute, Sir. You\u0027ll get yourself in trouble again. Do you \u0027ear me, Sir?\" But the Padre apparently did not hear him, for he plodded steadily on his way. The batman gave a sob of despair and broke into a double. The Colonel sprang to his feet. \"Hey, stop him, somebody! Those swine\u0027ll shoot him in a second—child murder!\" Two subalterns ran forward, followed by a trio of N.C.O.\u0027s. All along the line men lifted their weary heads from the ground and saw the tiny figure on the ridge silhouetted against the red east. \"Oo\u0027s that blinkin\u0027 fool?\" \"The Padre.\" \"Wot\u0027s \u0027e doin\u0027 of?\" \"Gawd knows.\" A man rose to his knees, from his knees to his feet, and stumbled forward, mumbling, \"\u0027E give me a packet of fags when I was broke.\" \"Me too,\" growled another, and followed his chum. \"They\u0027ll shoot \u0027im in a minute,\" a voice shouted, suddenly frightened. \"\u0027Ere, this ain\u0027t war, this is blasted baby-killin\u0027.\" In another five seconds the whole line was up and jogging forward at a lurching double. \"And a little child shall lead them,\" murmured the Colonel happily, as he put his best sock forwards; a miracle had happened, and his dear ruffians would go down in glory. But as they topped the hill crest, came the shrill of a whistle from the opposite ridge, and there was half a battalion of the Rutlands back casting for the enemy that had broken through their posts. With wild yells both parties charged downwards into the sunken road. When the tumult and shouting had died Patrick went in quest of the little Padre. He discovered him sitting on the wreck of his bivouac of the night; he was clasping some small article to his bosom, and the look on his face was that of a man who had found his heart\u0027s desire. Patrick sat himself down on a box of bombs, and looked humbly at the Reverend Paul. It is an awful thing for a man suddenly to find he has been entertaining a hero unawares. \"Oh, Dicky Bird, Dicky Bird, why did you do it?\" he inquired softly. The Padre cocked his head on one side and commenced to ooze apologies from every pore. \"Oh dear—you know how absurdly absent-minded I am; well, I suddenly remembered I had left my teeth behind.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3294/90081.html","bookId":457,"book":{"id":457,"title":"The Mudlarks","description":"简介： When I was young, my parents sent me to a boarding school, not in any hopes of getting me educated, but because they wanted a quiet home....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3294","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:47 AM"}}
