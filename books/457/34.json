{"id":41790,"no":34,"title":"XXXIII LIONEL TRELAWNEY","content":"Lionel Trelawney Molyneux-Molyneux was of the race of the Beaux. Had he flourished in the elegant days, Nash would have taken snuff with him, D\u0027Orsay wine—no less. As it was, the high priests of Savile Row made obeisance before him, the staff of the Tailor and Cutter penned leaders on his waistcoats, and the lilies of the field whined \"Kamerad\" and withered away. When war broke out Lionel Trelawney issued from his comfortable chambers in St. James\u0027s and took a hand in it. He had no enthusiasm for blood-letting. War, he maintained from the first, was a vulgar pastime, a comfortless revolting state of affairs which bored one stiff, forced one to associate with all sorts of impossible people and ruined one\u0027s clothes. Nevertheless the West-end had to be saved from an invasion of elastic-sided boots, celluloid dickeys, Tyrolese hats and musical soup-swallowing. That was his war-aim. Through the influence of an aunt at the War Office he obtained a commission at once, and after a month\u0027s joining-leave (spent closeted with his tailor) he appeared, a shining figure, in the Mess of the Loamshire Light Infantry and with them adventured to Gallipoli. It is related that during the hell of that first landing, when boats were capsizing, wounded men being dragged under by tentacles of barbed wire, machine-guns whipping the sea to bloody froth, Lionel Trelawney was observed standing on a prominent part of a barge, his eye-glass fixed on his immaculate field boots, petulantly remarking, \"And now, damn it, I suppose I\u0027ve got to get wet!\" After the evacuation the battalion went to France, but not even the slush of the salient or the ooze of Festubert could dim his splendour. Whenever he got a chance he sat down, cat-like, and licked himself. Wherever he went his batman went also, hauling a sackful of cleaning gear and changes of raiment. On one occasion, hastening to catch the leave train, he spurred his charger into La Bassée Canal. He emerged, like some river deity, profusely decorated in chick-weed, his eyeglass still in his eye (\"Came up like a blinking U-boat,\" said a spectator, \"periscope first\"), footed it back to billets and changed, though it cost him two days of his leave. He was neither a good nor a keen officer. He was not frightened—he had too great a contempt for war to admit the terror of it—but he gloomed and brooded eternally and made no effort to throw the faintest enthusiasm into his job. Yet for all that the Loamshires suffered him. He had his uses—he kept the men amused. In that tense time just before an attack, when the minute hand was jerking nearer and nearer to zero, when nerves were strung tight and people were sending anxious inquiries after Lewis guns, S.A.A., stretchers, bombs, etc., Lionel Trelawney would say to his batman, \"Have you got the boot and brass polish, the Blanco, the brushes? Sure?\" (a sigh of relief). \"Very well, now we\u0027ll be getting on,\" and so would send his lads scrambling over the parapet grinning from east to west. \"Where\u0027s ole Collar and Cuffs?\" some muddy warrior would shout after a shrieking tornado of shell had swept over them. \"Dahn a shell-hole cleanin\u0027 his teef,\" would come the answer, and the battered platoon chuckled merrily. \"\u0027E\u0027s a card, \u0027e is,\" said his Sergeant admiringly. \"Marched four miles back to billets in \u0027is gas-mask, perishin\u0027 \u0027ot, all because he\u0027d lost \u0027is razor an\u0027 \u0027adn\u0027t shaved for two days. \u0027E\u0027s a nut \u0027e is and no error.\" It happened that the Loamshires were given a job of crossing Mr. Hindenburg\u0027s well-known ditch and taking a village on the other side. A company of tanks, which came rolling out of the dawn-drizzle, spitting fire from every crack, put seven sorts of wind up the Landsturmer gentlemen in possession; and the Loamshires, getting their first objectives with very light casualties, trotted on for their second in high fettle, sterns up and wagging proudly. The tanks went through the village knocking chips off the architecture and pushing over houses that got in the way; and the Loamshires followed after, distributing bombs among the cellars. The consolidation was proceeding when Lionel Trelawney sauntered on the scene, picking his way delicately through the débris of the main street. He lounged up to a group of Loamshire officers, yawned, told them how tired he was, cursed the drizzle for dimming his buttons and strolled over to a dug-out with the object of sheltering there. He got no further than the entrance, for as he reached it a wide-eyed German came scrambling up the steps and collided with him, bows on. For a full second the two stood chest to chest gaping, too surprised to move. Then the Hun turned and bolted. But this time Lionel Trelawney was not too bored to act. He drew his revolver and rushed after him like one possessed, firing wildly. Two shots emptied a puddle, one burst a sandbag, one winged a weather-cock and one went just anywhere. His empty revolver caught the flying Hun in the small of the back as he vaulted over a wall; and Lionel Trelawney vaulted after him. \"Molly\u0027s gone mad,\" shouted his amazed brother-officers as they scrambled up a ruin for a better view of the hunt. The chase was proceeding full-cry among the small gardens of the main street. It was a stirring spectacle. The Hun was sprinting for dear life, Lionel Trelawney hard on his brush, yelping like a frenzied fox-terrier. They plunged across tangled beds, crashed through crazy fences, fell head over heels, picked themselves up again and raced on, wheezing like punctured bagpipes. Heads of Atkinses poked up everywhere. \"S\u0027welp me if it ain\u0027t ole Collar and Cuffs! Go it, Sir, that\u0027s the stuff to give \u0027em!\" A Yorkshireman opened a book and started to chant the odds, but nobody paid any attention to him. The Hun, badly blown, dodged inside a shattered hen-house. Lionel Trelawney tore up handfuls of a ruined wall and bombed him out of it with showers of brickbats. Away went the chase again, cheered by shrill yoicks and cat-calls from the spectators. Suddenly there was an upheaval of planks and brick-dust, and both runners disappeared. \"Gone to ground, down a cellar,\" exclaimed the brother-officers. \"Oh, look! Fritz is crawling out.\" The white terrified face of the German appeared on the ground level, then with a wriggle (accompanied by a loud noise of rending material) he dragged his body up and was on his way once more. A second later Lionel Trelawney was up as well, waving a patch of grey cloth in his hand. \"Molly\u0027s ripped the seat out of his pants,\" shouted the grand-stand. \"Yow, tear \u0027m, Pup!\" \"Good ole Collar and Cuffs!\" chorused the Loamshire Atkinses. Lionel Trelawney responded nobly; he gained one yard, two yards, five, ten. The Hun floundered into a row of raspberry canes, tripped and wallowed in the mould. Trelawney fell on him like a Scot on a three-penny bit and they rolled out of sight locked in each other\u0027s embrace. The Loamshires jumped down from their crazy perches and doubled to see the finish, guided by the growlings, grunts, crashing of raspberry canes and jets of garden mould flung sky-high. They were too late, however. They met the victor propelling the remains of the vanquished up a lane towards them. His fawn breeches were black with mould, his shapely tunic shredded to ribbons; his sleek hair looked like a bird\u0027s-nest; his nose listed to starboard; one eye bulged like a shuttered bow-window; his eye-glass was not. But the amazing thing about it was that he didn\u0027t seem to mind; he beamed, in fact, and with a cheery shout to his friends—\"Merry little scamper—eh, what?\"—he drop-kicked his souvenir a few yards further on, exclaiming, \"That\u0027ll teach you to slop soup over my shirt-front, you rude fellow!\" \"Soup over your shirt-front!\" babbled the Loamshires. \"What are you talking about?\" \"Talking about?\" said Lionel Trelawney. \"Why, this arch-ruffian used to be a waiter at Claritz\u0027s, and he shed mulligatawny all over my glad-rags one night three years ago—aggravated me fearfully.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3294/90109.html","bookId":457,"book":{"id":457,"title":"The Mudlarks","description":"简介： When I was young, my parents sent me to a boarding school, not in any hopes of getting me educated, but because they wanted a quiet home....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3294","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:47 AM"}}
