{"id":41775,"no":19,"title":"XIX WAR VEGETATION","content":"\u0027Tis her ladyship up at the Castle that has the War at heart; \u0027tis no laughin\u0027 matter wid her. She came back from England wid the grandest modern notions for conductin\u0027 the war in the home that ever ye\u0027d see, an\u0027 a foreign domestic maid she had hired in London. \"\u0027Tis a poor Belgium refuge she is, Delaney,\" says Herself to meself. \"In the home she is afther lavin\u0027 there is nothing left standin\u0027 but the wine-cellar, an\u0027 that full o\u0027 German Huns—she is wet wid weepin\u0027 yet,\" says Herself; \"so be kind to her, for we must help our brave Allies.\" So the Belgium refuge walks into the Castle an\u0027 becomes lady\u0027s maid. A fine, upstandin\u0027 colleen it is, too, by the same token, wid notions in dhress that turned all the counthry gurrls contemptjous wid envy, an\u0027 a hat on the head of her that was like a conservatory for the flowers that was in it. But did Herself\u0027s war work stop at adoptin\u0027 our brave Alice? It did not. She gave the young ladies of the high nobility a powerful organisin\u0027, an\u0027 they\u0027d be in at Ballydrogeen every day o\u0027 the week sellin\u0027 Frinch, Eyetalian, Rooshan, an\u0027 Japan flags an\u0027 makin\u0027 a mint o\u0027 money at it. The lads that would be comin\u0027 into Ballydrogeen Fair to do a bit of hand slappin\u0027 over a pig, an\u0027 mebbe taste a tageen wid the luckpenny, would dishcover themselves goin\u0027 home in the ass cart, pig an\u0027 all, sober as stones an\u0027 plasthered thick wid flags the way you\u0027d think they\u0027d be the winnin\u0027 boat at Galway Regatta. For \u0027tis a bould bouchal will stand up to the young ladies of the high nobility whin they have their best dhresses on an\u0027 do be prancin\u0027 up to ye, the smiles an\u0027 blarney dhrippin\u0027 from them like golden syrup, wid their \"Oh, Mickey, how is your dear darlint baby? Have ye not the least little shillin\u0027 for me, thin?\" or their \"Good day to ye, Terry Ryan; I\u0027m all in love wid that bay colt ye have, an\u0027 I will plague my Da into his grave until he buys him for me. Will ye not have a small triflin\u0027 flag from me, Terry Ryan?\" But did Herself\u0027s war work stop at flag selling? It did not. Wan mornin\u0027 she comes steppin\u0027 down the garden as elegant as a champion hackney, holdin\u0027 her skirts high out of the wet. \"Is that you, Delaney?\" says she. \"It is, your ladyship,\" says I, crawlin\u0027 out from behindt the swate pays. \"Listen to me,\" says she. \"Thim flowers is nothin\u0027 but a luxury these days. I\u0027ll have nothin\u0027 but war vigitables in my garden.\" Says I, \"Beggin\u0027 your pardon, but phwat may they be?\" She was puzzled for a moment, an\u0027 stands there scratchin\u0027 her ear as ye might say. \"Oh, jist ordinary vigitables, only grown under war conditions,\" says she at length. \"At anny rate I\u0027ll have no flowers, so desthroy thim entirely, an\u0027 grow vigitables in their place—d\u0027you understand?\" says she. \"I do, your ladyship,\" says I. I wint within to tell Anne Toher, the cook. \"Herself is for desthroyin\u0027 the flowers entirely, an\u0027 plantin\u0027 war vigitables,\" says I. \"An\u0027 phwat may they be?\" says the woman. \"The same as ordinary vigitables, only growed under war conditions,\" says I. \"Ivvry spud doin\u0027 its duty, ivvry parsnip strugglin\u0027 to be two. We will have carrots an\u0027 onions in iwry bed up to the front door, Frinch beans trained all over the porch. Ye\u0027ll jist lane out of the kitchen winda an\u0027 gather in the dinner yourself; \u0027twill be a great savin\u0027 o\u0027 labour,\" says I. \"An\u0027 phwat\u0027ll ye do for the table decorations whin the gintry comes callin\u0027?\" says Anne Toher. \"Faith,\" says I, \"\u0027tis aisy done; I will jist set a bookay o\u0027 hothouse cabbages in the vases, an\u0027 if, mebbe, the Colonel would be comin\u0027 home on lave an\u0027 should ax a nosegay to stick in his coat, begob I\u0027ll have a fine sprig of parsley for him,\" says I. \"Ye poor man,\" says she, \"\u0027twill sour the heart within ye.\" Ah! That was the true word, \u0027twas like pullin\u0027 me heart\u0027s blood out be the roots to desthroy thim flowers; but it had to be done. War is war. By June the garden was nothin\u0027 but a say of vigitables, an\u0027 divil a touch of colour to take your eye was there in it, no matter how long you\u0027d look. Wan day I am up at the yard, seein\u0027 if, mebbe, Anne Toher would have the taste o\u0027 tay in the pot, meself havin\u0027 a thirst on me that would face the Shannon by dint of the hoein\u0027 I was afther doin\u0027 in the spud plantations, whin the woman puts her head out of the kitchen winda. \"Whist, Delaney,\" says she, \"there\u0027s gintry to lunch,\" says she. \"Phwat gintry?\" says I. \"Sir Patrick Freebody, o\u0027 Michaelstown,\" says she, an\u0027 at that me blood run cowld. Sir Patrick Freebody had the grandest garden over at Michaelstown that ivver you\u0027d see in the nation of Ireland, an\u0027 a cousin to me, John O\u0027Callaghan, was gardener to him. There was no love betwane us either, by the same token. I would as soon wake John O\u0027Callaghan as I would the Divil, an\u0027 that\u0027s the morthal truth, for all that he was a cousin to me. I knew how \u0027twould be as sure as I was alive in this worrld. Owld Sir Pat would be into lunch before a bare board, an\u0027 whin he wint home to Michaelstown he would be tellin\u0027 John O\u0027Callaghan, an\u0027 I would be skinned raw wid the jeerin\u0027 an\u0027 blaggardin\u0027 the same John O\u0027Callaghan would have wid me. \"Whisper, whin will they be atein\u0027?\" says I to Anne Toher. \"In ten minutes, please God, an\u0027 the spuds are soft,\" says she. \"Begob,\" says I to meself, \"I\u0027ll set flowers on that table or cut my throat across,\" an\u0027 I ran away, not knowin\u0027 where I\u0027d be findin\u0027 thim, not within five miles. But I was not half-way round the laurel bushes whin the Blessed Saints sent me light. In sivin minuites I had flowers in the middle bowl, an\u0027 backed away behindt the hat-racks as Herself an\u0027 owld Sir Pat comes out of the drawin\u0027-room an\u0027 goes in to lunch. I set me eye to the kayhole and watched, me heart like water betwane me teeth. Owld Sir Pat, he mumbles an\u0027 coughs an\u0027 talks about the weather, an\u0027 the war, an\u0027 the recruitin\u0027. Herself she talks about the soldiers\u0027 shest-protectors an\u0027 her war work, an\u0027 how she was scared the Colonel was sittin\u0027 about at the Front wid wet fate. Presently the owld man notices the flowers in the bowl an\u0027 lanes over the table blinkin\u0027 at thim through his spectacles in his half-blind way. \"Lovely flowers ye have there, Lady Nugent, positive blaze o\u0027 colour. How do you do it? Now, that scamp of a gardener of mine——\" He sits back again, tellin\u0027 Herself how John O\u0027Callaghan had left his chrysanthemums go to ruination wid blight. Her Ladyship takes wan look at the flowers, her eyebrows go up, she turns as red as a bateroot and bites her lip, but says nothin\u0027. God bless her! I backed away, breathin\u0027 aisy once more, but at that minuite down the stairs comes our brave Alice, the Belgium refuge, all of a lather, gabbing like a turkey in the foreign tongue, and runs straight for the dinin\u0027-room door. \u0027Tis a mercy I have the quick wit; I pulled down the Colonel\u0027s dhress-sword from where it hung on the wall and headed her off, wavin\u0027 it at her the way I\u0027d draw the stroke of it across her windpipe. She wint leppin\u0027 back up the stairs like a mountainy hare among the rocks, thinkin\u0027, mebbe, the German Huns was come at her again out of the wine-cellar. An hour later I heard owld Sir Pat\u0027s car lavin\u0027 the front door, so I sheathed me sword an\u0027 let her out of her bedroom where she had herself locked in. A strong shindy the gurrl raised, an\u0027 Herself forced me to buy her a new hat out of me wages, seein\u0027 that her owld wan was desthroyed by dint of the soakin\u0027 an\u0027 crushin\u0027 it had in the flower bowl; but sorra the bit did I care, for I passed John O\u0027Callaghan beyond in Michaelstown on Sunday, an\u0027 divil a word said he, but scowled at me in a way that did my heart good to see.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3294/90094.html","bookId":457,"book":{"id":457,"title":"The Mudlarks","description":"简介： When I was young, my parents sent me to a boarding school, not in any hopes of getting me educated, but because they wanted a quiet home....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3294","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:47 AM"}}
