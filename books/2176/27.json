{"id":99406,"no":27,"title":"Page 27","content":"Outside the castle. At the point where we entered this world. Beranabus claps my back and says, \"Let\u0027s go find Cadaver.\" Sharmila groans. Dervish looks at Beranabus as if he has two heads. Even Shark fidgets as though a terrible curse had been uttered. \"What?\" Beranabus snaps, frowning at his Disciples. \"We have to capture him, squeeze out whatever he knows about the Kah-Gash. That\u0027s what we came here for.\"\n \"It is over,\" Sharmila says. \"Nadia was wrong about the Kah-Gash. Or we already came upon it and failed to recognise it. Either way, Cadaver\u0027s real purpose was to bring Kernel into this universe, so he could learn the truth about the theft. Now it is time for him to return to his parents and - \"\n \"No!\" Beranabus shouts. \"His brother never mattered. This is about the Kah-Gash and always has been.\"\n \"To you, perhaps,\" Dervish says softly. \"But not to Kernel. And not, I think, to the rest of us. Sharmila\u0027s right - it\u0027s over.\n Beranabus glares at us. An angry red flush creeps up his neck. He starts to say something but Shark steps forward, halting him. \"I\u0027ll serve if you want me. If you think I can help you find this demon-destroying weapon, I\u0027m yours for life. But I doubt I\u0027ll make a difference. I don\u0027t think any of us will. I agree with Dervish - this was about Kernel and his search. That\u0027s what brought us here. It doesn\u0027t seem like much, and it\u0027s crazy that Raz and Nadia had to die because of it - but that\u0027s life.\"\n Beranabus growls. \"Think you\u0027re smarter than me, do you?\"\n \"No. But I can see the truth when it\u0027s sitting before me plain as day. I don\u0027t know anything about the Kah-Gash. Maybe you\u0027ll find it later, maybe you won\u0027t. Maybe Cadaver can lead you to it, maybe he can\u0027t. But it\u0027s time to let Kernel go. He doesn\u0027t belong here. He\u0027s not part of this. Not anymore.\"\n It\u0027s the most I\u0027ve ever heard Shark say. I want to thank him, but my throat\u0027s as tight as when I was being strangled by Cadaver\u0027s hairs.\n Beranabus scowls at his three Disciples, lets his gaze linger on me, then gives a disinterested sniff. \"So be it. I\u0027m not going to argue with all of you. I\u0027m starting to think it was a fool\u0027s errand. I\u0027ll look for Cadaver anyway, just in case, but there\u0027s no reason for you to come with me. The fighting\u0027s over. And the deaths.\"\n He turns away, takes a deep breath, starts muttering the words of a spell.\n Sharmila, Shark and Dervish exchange uncertain glances.\n \"That\u0027s it?\" Dervish asks. \"We can go?\"\n \"Aye. Get the boy to open a window for you. Return to your normal duties. I\u0027ll be in touch later. If I need you.\"\n Dervish laughs. Sharmila and Shark smile. Then all three look at me.\n \"Where do you want to go?\" I ask them.\n \"Drop us off at your place,\" Shark says. \"We\u0027ll make our own way from there.\"\n I nod slowly, then face the patches of light. They surround me as usual, now that I\u0027ve come out of the Board, glowing in the air around me. Half eager, half afraid, I think about Paskinston.\n It doesn\u0027t take long. I slot the patches of pulsing lights together. The window opens. Clean blue light. The doorway out of all this craziness. I take one last look back at the castle, the demon-laced sky, Beranabus.\n \"Thank you,\" I mutter. \"I know you only helped me because you wanted to find the Kah-Gash. But I couldn\u0027t have discovered the truth without you.\"\n \"Much good it did you,\" Beranabus grunts. He looks at me with his grey-blue eyes. Cocks his head. \"Home isn\u0027t always where you expect it to be. It can change, as life changes. If you ever need me, you know where to find me.\"\n \"He won\u0027t,\" Dervish says shortly, then pushes me through the window of light, out of the universe of demons.\n Night. We\u0027re in a field outside Paskinston. Where Mrs. Egin exploded and Cadaver crossed. The four of us standing beneath a half moon, looking at each other, breathing in the delicious smell of our own world.\n \"We are a sight,\" Sharmila laughs, nodding at our torn clothes, ripped flesh and bare feet.\n \"At least we\u0027re not a stench,\" Shark says. He sniffs a sleeve and his face turns green at the memory of the gory pool.\n \"Thank you,\" I whisper, eyes lowered, suddenly shy, feeling like a child again, the way I did before I crossed universes. I was their equal over there. Here, I\u0027m just a boy.\n \"No need for thanks,\" Dervish smiles. \"We had the adventure of a lifetime.\"\n \"I would not call it an adventure,\" Sharmila says thoughtfully. \"More a nightmare - the like of which I hope never to experience again.\"\n Dervish smiles. \"Be truthful. Now we\u0027ve come through alive, don\u0027t tell me you aren\u0027t a bit sorry that it\u0027s over. It was wild but magical. Right?\"\n \"No. It was horrible. I hated every minute of it.\"\n \"Shark?\" Dervish asks.\n \"I hated the pool of slime,\" he grunts and we all laugh. \"Otherwise, it was a buzz. But that\u0027s because we survived. I\u0027m sure Raz and Nadia had a different view of it.\"\n I feel a jolt of guilt when he mentions Nadia. I should tell them about her. But I gave my word. Besides, she said she wouldn\u0027t hurt them. The only one she hates is Beranabus.\n \"What was Raz like?\" Dervish asks, smile fading.\n \"A gentleman,\" Sharmila says.\n \"Yeah,\" Shark agrees. \"I knew Raz. A top cat. But let\u0027s not talk about him. In our business, it\u0027s best to forget about death and focus on living.\" He stretches and groans. \"I\u0027m off to find a lake to soak in. How about you lot?\"\n \"I\u0027ll come with you,\" Dervish says. \"I still have a lot to learn about being a Disciple.\"\n \"I\u0027m not so sure,\" Shark murmurs, then raises an eyebrow at Sharmila.\n \"I want some time off,\" the Indian lady says, gazing at the moon. \"I have been a Disciple for many years. I am due a break. Maybe I will go to the village of my parents and pray to their memory. They were killed by demons.\" She sighs and lowers her eyes. \"I will pray for Raz too. And Nadia. And the others who died in the course of this quest.\" She looks at me. \"And I will pray for Kernel. And maybe for Art, even if he did not ever really exist.\"\n I smile at Sharmila thankfully, then stretch out my arms for a hug. As she wraps her arms around me, she whispers in my ear. \"It was strange that you could not find the Kah-Gash.\"\n \"Maybe it doesn\u0027t exist,\" I reply.\n \"Or maybe...\" She hesitates, then releases me. \"I wonder what would have happened if you\u0027d tried to open a window to one of us when we were with you in that universe.\"\n I frown. \"What do you mean?\"\n She smiles cryptically in answer, kisses my cheeks, then steps back.\n \"We can stay with you a while,\" Dervish says, as I hover uncertainly at the edge of the village. \"Help you readjust and explain all this to your parents.\"\n I laugh. \"You really think you can explain Lord Loss to my mum and dad?\"\n \"You have a point,\" Dervish chuckles.\n I shake Shark\u0027s hand, admiring his tattoos one final time. He salutes sharply when I let go. Then I shake hands with Dervish. \"Your spikes have gone floppy,\" I note.\n \"I feel floppy all over,\" he grins.\n The four of us share one final glance that says more than any words. With a tired wave, I turn away from the three Disciples, face the village lights, steady myself and wonder what Mum and Dad will say when I step through the door. With an excited but nervous shiver, I start on the short walk home. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/demon-thief-the-demonata-2/page-27.html","bookId":2176,"book":{"id":2176,"title":"Demon Thief (The Demonata #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Demon Thief (The Demonata #2) \n This story is told through the eyes of lonely child Cornelius \"Kernel\" Fleck and takes place probably somewhere in the United Kingdom or Ireland and during the 1970s.
