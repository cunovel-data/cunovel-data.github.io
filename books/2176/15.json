{"id":99395,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"I come out on top of a fluffy cloud. Through a break to my left I see land far below. My stomach drops as I picture myself falling through the mist, then the sky, hitting the ground hard and splattering. But the cloud holds, supporting me like the water in the first world I visited.\n Shark steps through after me, Dervish just behind him. They yell with shock when they see what we\u0027re standing on. Turn to dive back through the window. \"It\u0027s OK!\" I shout. \"We won\u0027t fall.\"\n They pause, glance at me uncertainly, then realise I\u0027m telling the truth - otherwise we\u0027d have already dropped.\n The now two-headed demon is on another bank of cloud ahead of us. When it spots us, it squeals with fear and bounds away. Shark starts after it, but Dervish calls him back. \"We\u0027re here to find Beranabus, not kill a stray demon.\"\n Shark pulls a face, loath to let the demon escape. Then he sighs. \"OK, kid. Tell us how you plan to find him.\"\n \"I\u0027ll open a window,\" I say, as the one we stepped through comes apart. \"Just give me a few minutes to find the patches.\"\n \" \u0027Patches\u0027?\" Dervish echoes, but I don\u0027t answer. Looking around, I\u0027m pleased to note that there are loads of patches of light in the air, despite the fact that we\u0027re standing on top of a cloud. I start thinking about Beranabus, muttering his name softly, hoping he\u0027s still alive and that I have the power to make the lights pulse.\n For a few seconds - nothing. But before panic has a chance to set in, a pink square by my left foot blinks. Then a brown octagon. Soon, dozens of the patches are pulsing and I merrily set to work.\n I\u0027m aware of Dervish and Shark talking while I build the window. Dervish is complaining about the cold. His leather jacket is too small to button up properly - it\u0027s for style, not warmth - and his bare chest is freezing in these icy heights.\n \"Use magic,\" I tell him, recalling the way I instinctively repaired my broken arm. \"You can warm up if you think yourself warm.\"\n Dervish is sceptical, but gives it a go, and moments later he\u0027s beaming, even taking his jacket off and tying it around his waist.\n \"You must have been here a long time to know so much,\" Shark says.\n \"Actually, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s been more than half a day,\" I reply. \"Though it feels longer. I\u0027ll tell you about it later, if we have time.\"\n The window comes together smoothly under my guidance. I don\u0027t hurry. Pleased to note I\u0027m no longer hungry or tired. Marvelling at the way this universe works. I start wondering if we could float down to the ground from here, but then the assembled patches pulse as one and a brownish window opens. \"Here we go,\" I say smugly.\n \"I didn\u0027t think windows could be opened that quickly or simply,\" Shark says.\n \"It\u0027s easy-peasy when you know how.\"\n Shark steps up beside me and looks back at Dervish. \"Ready for the next leg of the tour?\"\n \"Hurm,\" Dervish says uncertainly. \"Do you know where that leads?\" he asks me.\n \"No. But Beranabus will be there.\" I hesitate. \"When I left him, he was in trouble, fighting a team of demons. We might have to help him. So be prepared, OK?\"\n \"Yes, boss,\" Shark laughs.\n \"Thanks for warning us,\" Dervish says, then takes up a position to my left. Shark slides into place on my right. We step through the window.\n It\u0027s the same world where Nadia and I ran out on Beranabus. Night. Three moons shine, closer than the moon is to Earth in my universe. Too bright to see if there are any giant demons soaring overhead.\n Corpses are scattered across the hard yellow ground. Demons in an advanced state of decomposition, most rotted to the bone. Either demons rot quickly here or this is one of those places where time runs faster than in the human universe.\n I spy Beranabus working on a window. Sharmila is nearby, sitting next to a mound of freshly dug earth. I guess it\u0027s Raz\u0027s final resting place, that she and Beranabus - probably just her - dug a grave for the fallen Disciple.\n I get a lump in my throat when I think about how Raz died, but there\u0027s no time to cry. I didn\u0027t believe I could be so matter of fact about the death of a friend, but I\u0027m learning a lot here. One of the things is that in times of severe disorder, you can\u0027t worry about the dead, only the living. I still think Art is alive. He\u0027s the one I have to focus on. I can\u0027t do any good for the dead Raz Warlo.\n \"Beranabus!\" I call. \"It\u0027s me, Kernel. I\u0027m back.\"\n The magician\u0027s head whips round and Sharmila\u0027s jerks up. They stare at me in disbelief, then at the two men with me. Then Beranabus cheers - the first time he\u0027s acted like an ordinary human since I met him - and rushes across to pick me up and whirl me around.\n \"Kernel Fleck!\" he booms. \"You\u0027re a wonder! I\u0027ve been struggling to build a window to you for days. And here you pop up, cool as a breeze! You\u0027re the most remarkable human I\u0027ve met in centuries!\"\n He sets me down and I find myself grinning at him. I hadn\u0027t liked the cranky magician before. But now I see he can be as emotional as any normal person. He simply hides his feelings better than most.\n \"Hello, Beranabus,\" Shark says, stepping forward, hand outstretched.\n Beranabus shakes the hand briefly, frowning. Then he points at Shark and says, \"Octopus?\"\n \"Shark,\" Shark laughs.\n \"Ah. I knew it was something like that.\" He looks at Dervish blankly.\n \"This is Dervish Grady,\" Shark introduces him. \"My latest recruit.\"\n \"Another Disciple,\" Beranabus murmurs, nodding shortly at Dervish. \"How many does that make?\"\n \"If you don\u0027t know, I\u0027m sure nobody does,\" Shark says.\n Beranabus shrugs. \"I never was good at numbers. Anyway, welcome to the team, Grady. I hope you last longer than some of my other followers.\" His eyes flash on Raz\u0027s grave.\n \"It is good to see you again, Kernel,\" Sharmila says, stepping forward to hug me. She looks drawn and miserable, but has reattached her arm and healed her wounds since the battle.\n \"I\u0027m pleased you made it,\" I whisper.\n \"It was close. My injuries were fatal. If not for Beranabus, I would have died.\"\n \"Yes, yes, I\u0027m better than any doctor,\" Beranabus says impatiently. \"Now what about my other Disciple? Where\u0027s Nadia? Not dead, surely.\"\n I pause. Part of me wants to cover up for her and tell him she was killed by a demon. But his small dark eyes are fixed on me and I find myself incapable of attempting a lie. \"She didn\u0027t want to come back. She left me. Went off by herself. She\u0027s had enough of demons.\"\n Beranabus\u0027 face blackens with fury. \"I\u0027ll flay her skin from her back! Find her. Open a window to her. Immediately.\"\n \"I do not think you should do that,\" Sharmila says. \"Nadia is a free agent. If she wants to - \"\n \"I don\u0027t care about her wants!\" Beranabus bellows. \"We need her. Now open that window, Kernel, and don\u0027t pretend you can\u0027t. I\u0027ll know if you\u0027re lying. And I\u0027ll punish you for it.\"\n I want to tell him to get stuffed, I\u0027m not his servant. But those dark eyes are fierce with anger when I look at him and I wilt. \"I\u0027ll try,\" I mutter unhappily. \"I\u0027m not sure it will work, since she\u0027s not in this universe, but I\u0027ll give it a go. If you\u0027re certain.\"\n \"Aye!\" Beranabus growls, glaring at me as I clear my thoughts and concentrate on Nadia\u0027s image, feeling like a traitor of the lowest, meanest order.\n We\u0027re waiting for Beranabus. He said that because of the time differences between this world and ours, he could be gone for a few hours as we experience it, even though it will only be a few minutes for him. I keep an eye on the window, holding it open. It\u0027s not hard. When I see a patch or two shimmer and start to slip free of the panel, I press them back into place.\n We chat to pass the time. Sharmila tells Dervish and Shark about the Kah-Gash, Beranabus\u0027 quest, her part in the mission. I describe how I got mixed up in it, and demonstrate how I can construct windows so quickly, though I can\u0027t explain why I alone can see the patches of light.\n In return, Shark and Dervish tell us of their lives. Shark\u0027s been a Disciple for several years, working with others to avert demonic crossings. He was in the army when he discovered his magical talent. On a tour of duty. A village came under attack from four demons. Shark and his team tried to stop them. A Disciple was present. He realised Shark\u0027s potential when he saw him fighting, pulled him clear of the massacre, explained about the Demonata. All of Shark\u0027s fellow soldiers were killed, so Shark became a Disciple, though he still wears his uniform out of respect for the dead.\n Dervish is new to the game. Shark discovered him a few months ago while trying to stop a crossing in the city where I met them. He was successful, thanks to Dervish, who happened to be nearby when a window was about to open. Dervish saw that Shark was in trouble, ran to his aid and used magic he\u0027d never known he possessed to knock out the woman trying to open the window. That was the end of life as he knew it.\n \"Is that how Disciples are normally recruited?\" I ask. \"There\u0027s an attack, they discover magic within themselves and a Disciple asks them to join?\"\n \"Pretty much,\" Shark says. \"Lots of people have magical ability, but it usually only reveals itself in the presence of demons. When windows are created, some of the magic of their universe flows through, which people like us can tap into, even without training or intent. We\u0027ve spent decades trying to identify and develop the potential some other way, but no luck so far.\"\n \"Does everybody join once they know they have the power?\" I ask.\n \"No,\" Sharmila answers. \"Many reject their calling. I do not blame them. Ours is a harsh life, lonely, filled with peril.\"\n Shark snorts with contempt. \"If I had my way, we\u0027d press-gang the lot of them, force them to fight.\"\n \"That would be unfair,\" Sharmila says.\n \"This isn\u0027t about fairness,\" Shark argues. \"It\u0027s about winning a war. You can\u0027t run away from your duty during war. It\u0027s desertion.\"\n \"That\u0027s what Nadia did,\" I say softly, and my eyes meet Sharmila\u0027s. We\u0027re both worried about what will happen when Beranabus catches up with her.\n Nadia falls hard through the window and lands heavily on the ground. She howls hatefully and tries to leap back through the panel of light. Beranabus appears before she completes the jump. Shoves her away, snarling like an animal. \"Stop!\" he roars.\n Nadia tries to wriggle around him, fingers stretching towards the window of light. He blocks her way, standing firm like a Roman emperor, while Nadia shrieks and wails.\n She tries using magic to move him, but he flicks aside her bolt of energy and holds his position. \"Kernel!\" he shouts. \"Dismantle the window.\"\n \"I\u0027m not sure I should - \"\n He flashes his teeth at me, making it very clear that he\u0027ll turn on me next if I disobey him. Feeling lousy and afraid, I slink around Nadia and Beranabus - the magician fending his assistant off, protecting me from her - and set to work on the window. After removing a few pieces, the patches slide apart and the window disappears.\n Nadia throws herself flat and weeps into the yellow earth, hammering the ground with her fists. Beranabus sighs and steps aside, rubbing the back of his neck. \"You\u0027ll thank me for this later,\" he says.\n \"I\u0027ll thank the demon who rips your head off and fills your skull with fire!\" she screams back, then bolts upright and glares at me. \"You showed him where to find me!\"\n \"I had to,\" I mutter shamefully. \"He said he\u0027d - \"\n She spits at me.\n \"Do not blame the boy,\" Sharmila says, putting her hands on my shoulders. \"He argued to leave you be, as did I. But Beranabus would not listen.\"\n \"Why?\" Nadia cries, whirling on Beranabus. \"Why didn\u0027t you leave me there? I could have been happy. Led a normal life. Been human again. Why rip me away from all that?\"\n \"I need you,\" Beranabus says flatly.\n \"No you don\u0027t! I gave you what you wanted - a vision which might help you find part of the Kah-Gash.\"\n \"There will be other parts to find.\"\n \"But that could take hundreds of years! Thousands! We\u0027ll both be dead long before that happens - if it ever does.\"\n Beranabus shrugs.\n \"This is slavery,\" Nadia snarls. \"You always said I was free to leave.\"\n \"And you are,\" Beranabus insists. \"As soon as we find the pieces of the Kah-Gash. Until then, I need you. Your universe needs you. I know you don\u0027t enjoy this, but that doesn\u0027t matter. You\u0027ve been chosen, like the rest of us. If we turn our backs on our responsibility, the entire world will fall to the Demonata.\"\n \"I don\u0027t care!\" Nadia shrieks. \"What\u0027s the difference between fighting them here or on my own world? They might as well take it over for all it matters to me!\"\n \"Then you would never have anywhere safe to go,\" Beranabus says.\n \"So? I can\u0027t go there anyway while you\u0027re holding me prisoner.\"\n Beranabus exhales sharply, starts to say something, stops, then smiles tightly. \"We\u0027ll make a deal. Stay with me until I find this piece of the Kah-Gash. After that, you can go. I\u0027ll open a window to the human world for you and not stand in your way.\"\n \"And if I die during the search?\" Nadia retorts. \"Or if it takes a hundred years to find it? Or if you never find it?\"\n Beranabus\u0027 smile disappears. \"I\u0027m trying to be reasonable.\"\n Nadia laughs. \"No. You know this is wrong and you want to feel better about it. You don\u0027t want to admit you\u0027re as ruthless and monstrous as the demons you claim to hate.\"\n \"I never said I hated the Demonata,\" Beranabus says quietly. \"And I never claimed to be anything other than - as you say - ruthless and monstrous. That\u0027s how I need to be to fight them.\"\n Nadia prepares another curse, then realises it would be a waste of breath. She looks around at us, hateful and alone. Points a finger at Beranabus. \"You betrayed me. That\u0027s something I won\u0027t forget or forgive. You don\u0027t just have to watch out for demons anymore - when I\u0027m around, you\u0027ll have to worry about me too. I hate you as much as they do now, and I\u0027ll quite gladly kill you if I ever get the chance. And anybody else who\u0027s with you.\"\n With that, she turns her back on us, screams at the three moons, then sits and weeps while Beranabus looks on with an unconvincing, half-shameful sneer. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/demon-thief-the-demonata-2/page-15.html","bookId":2176,"book":{"id":2176,"title":"Demon Thief (The Demonata #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Demon Thief (The Demonata #2) \n This story is told through the eyes of lonely child Cornelius \"Kernel\" Fleck and takes place probably somewhere in the United Kingdom or Ireland and during the 1970s.
