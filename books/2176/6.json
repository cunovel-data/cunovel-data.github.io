{"id":99388,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"Chaos. Everyone\u0027s running, crashing into each other, falling, screaming. I\u0027m part of the madness. Clutching Art in my arms. Fleeing blindly. Away from the grey light and the four-armed monster. Trying to stay on my feet. Weeping, partly because Logan has been killed, mostly because I\u0027m terrified.\n A girl smashes into me and knocks me to the ground. I manage to fall with Art on top of me, so he isn\u0027t injured. He\u0027s laughing - he thinks this is a game. I start to yell at the girl, but then I see blood gushing from her throat, her arms thrashing. She topples over. Flops about, then goes very still.\n I look away before I can focus on her face. I don\u0027t want to know who she is. Right now I want to concentrate on the one thing that matters more than anything else - getting out of here before the monster kills me.\n I push myself to my feet, chest heaving. Look for the best way out. It\u0027s hard to tell. I\u0027m surrounded on all sides by panic. I count two, three, four dead children - then stop. I don\u0027t want to know the numbers.\n The monster\u0027s on top of a boy - Dave English, who was so afraid of death. The beast\u0027s fingers are buried in Dave\u0027s stomach. It\u0027s gazing around, white eyes darting from one child to another. Like it\u0027s choosing its next victim. Or looking for someone in particular.\n I\u0027m getting ready to run again when I spot movement in the panel of grey light. A man steps through. Behind him is a blonde woman. Another woman after her, Indian, wearing a sari. Then a second dark-skinned man.\n The Indian woman curses when she sees the corpses. Starts after the monster, her hands coming up, murder in her eyes.\n \"Sharmila! No!\" barks the first man. He\u0027s old. He has a short beard and messy dark hair. A shabby suit.\n \"We must stop this!\" the Indian woman shouts.\n \"No,\" the man repeats, and I can tell by his tone that he\u0027s accustomed to being obeyed.\n \"Master...\" the second man says uncertainly. He has the darkest skin I\u0027ve ever seen, as if his mother was the night.\n \"I know, Raz,\" the first man snaps. \"But we mustn\u0027t kill him.\"\n \"The children,\" the Indian woman snarls. \"I will not stand by and let that demon murder all these children. That would be monstrous.\"\n \"She is right, master,\" the black man says.\n \"Oh, very well,\" the man in the shabby suit grumbles. \"We\u0027ll save as many of the young as we can. We don\u0027t want to be considered barbarians.\" He laughs then signals for the others to spread out. \"Work Cadaver back to the window and force him through. We\u0027ll track him down again later.\"\n This sudden appearance and surreal conversation has astonished me so much, I\u0027m standing still instead of fleeing for safety. The monster - a demon, the woman said - has moved on from Dave English and is lolloping after a girl. She\u0027s racing from it like an Olympic sprinter, but the monster\u0027s legs are longer and it catches up with her in a couple of seconds. Reaches out with its long, hairy fingers... then recoils when the ground at its feet explodes upwards.\n The demon makes a high whistling sound, its head snapping round. It spots the four humans who came through the panel (or window, as the man called it). It glares at them, white eyes filled with fury and hate. They\u0027re closing in on it from both sides, leaving a path to the window free. Pale blue light crackles from the black man\u0027s fingertips - I guess he made the ground explode, distracting the monster and saving the girl.\n Art bites my right arm, hard. It\u0027s the first time he\u0027s ever bitten me. I get such a shock, I drop him and collapse on my bum. He lands with a heavy thud, rolls over, then crawls towards the demon, gurgling happily. He must think it\u0027s some giant toy. He\u0027s so anxious to play with it, he bit me so I\u0027d release him.\n \"Art!\" I yell. \"Come back! It\u0027s...\"\n The demon spots me. Its white eyes roll down and fix on Art. It gives a loud, high-pitched whistle. And then it\u0027s running towards us, impossibly long steps. I barely have time to register fear - then it\u0027s on us. It stoops, picks Art up with one hand, hisses like a nest of snakes.\n \"No!\" I cry, leaping at the demon, forgetting my fear, caring only about Art. I land on the monster\u0027s left side. From a distance I thought its skin was leathery, but now I realise it\u0027s more like an insect\u0027s brittle shell. My fists crunch into it, knocking crinkly flakes loose. I\u0027m yelling wildly, the way I always do when I get into a fight.\n I tug at its hairy arms - they feel like strands of seaweed - desperately reaching for Art. The demon hisses again then knocks me aside. I land hard on my right arm. It twists beneath me and snaps. I roar with pain, but roll over and force myself back to my feet, woozy but determined to rescue Art.\n But the demon isn\u0027t there. It\u0027s racing towards the grey window, Art cradled in its arms, head down, legs a whirl of motion.\n \"Beranabus!\" the Indian woman shouts.\n \"Let him go,\" the leader of the quartet says.\n \"But the child...\"\n \"Not our problem.\"\n \"Art!\" I bellow, tears streaming from my eyes. It\u0027s hopeless, but I run after the demon, praying for the strength and speed to draw level with it before it reaches the window.\n The demon pauses at the panel of grey light. Looks back at the four adults. It hisses and shakes Art at them, mocking them. The hairs of its hands wrap round Art\u0027s ankles then snake up his legs. He\u0027s giggling, tugging at the monster\u0027s floppy ears, no idea of the danger he\u0027s in. He drops his orange marbles - he\u0027s found something better to play with.\n The Indian woman snarls and extends a hand towards the demon. She starts muttering the words of what sounds like a spell. Before she can complete it, the monster jumps at the window, hits the grey light and vanishes. Returns to whatever hellish place it came from - with Art.\n I sink to my knees, stunned, staring at the window. Around me - screams, sobbing, moans. The stench of blood and death. Calls from the village as terrified adults race towards their stricken children, too late to help, only in time to mop up the blood.\n The four people who came through after the monster have gathered by the window. The light is pulsing again. The edges are throbbing inwards, turning white. The leader stands in front of the panel.\n \"Do you think he\u0027s waiting for us on the other side?\" the dark-skinned man asks.\n The leader shrugs. \"Only one way to find out.\" He steps forward and disappears like the demon. The blonde woman follows, then the black man. The Indian woman pauses and looks round the field of misery. Her gaze rests on me. She winces. Starts to say something. Changes her mind and steps into the light.\n I\u0027m dazed. Shaking from shock and the pain in my right arm. Silently staring at the grey light as it pulses quicker and quicker, the edges closing in. It\u0027s about to collapse, break apart, become fragmented patches of light again.\n Fresh screams as parents find the remains of their children. A chorus of wails, growing by the second, becoming a wall of anguished sound. Some kids are still running. They don\u0027t know it\u0027s finished, that the monster\u0027s gone, that the last victim was Art.\n I stumble towards the flickering window, wanting to believe there\u0027s hope, that the Indian woman will reappear with Art in her arms. Art can\u0027t be gone forever. I can\u0027t have lost him. He\u0027s my brother.\n I spot the marbles on the ground by the window. I pick them up, study their orange centres, then put them in my left trouser pocket. I\u0027m numb. Hardly aware of the throbbing pain in my broken arm.\n I think about Mum and Dad, how they\u0027ll react when they return to find Paskinston in mourning, Art abducted. Mum\u0027s last words to me echo inside my skull - \"Look after your brother.\" Dad calling me the best brother in the world, saying I\u0027d take better care of Art than they could.\n But I didn\u0027t. I let a demon take him.\n Staring into the heart of the grey light. I tune out the screams. Focus on the window. A voice whispers to me, a voice I haven\u0027t heard for a year. Tells me what I must do. What it suggests is crazy. I should dismiss it immediately. But I can\u0027t.\n The window is closing. Any second now, it\u0027ll be gone. But if I step forward before it closes... chase after the demon... perhaps I can find Art, rescue him, bring him back home.\n Madness. Art\u0027s probably dead already, slaughtered by the demon as soon as it escaped. Besides, I don\u0027t know what lies on the other side of the window. Most likely more monsters like the one that took Art. I\u0027ll almost certainly be killed. Even if I\u0027m not, there\u0027ll be no way back once the window breaks up. Mum and Dad will lose both their children. Double the sorrow. I should forget about it. Ignore the voice and its suicidal suggestion.\n But I can\u0027t. Because they\u0027ll blame me. They won\u0027t want to, but the accusation will be there, in their eyes. A look that says, \"You didn\u0027t take care of him. He was your brother. You didn\u0027t protect him. You let him go. It\u0027s your fault.\"\n The edges of the window bend inward. The grey light sputters. There\u0027s no more time. I have to decide.\n I start to look back, wanting the window to close before I can act, to cheat myself of the chance to go after Art. But as my head turns, my feet move forward. Instinct makes me step through the grey light of the window - into the realm of the murderous demon. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/demon-thief-the-demonata-2/page-6.html","bookId":2176,"book":{"id":2176,"title":"Demon Thief (The Demonata #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Demon Thief (The Demonata #2) \n This story is told through the eyes of lonely child Cornelius \"Kernel\" Fleck and takes place probably somewhere in the United Kingdom or Ireland and during the 1970s.
