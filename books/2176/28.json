I found it almost impossible to believe, even though Lord Loss had warned me. Seven years of change, births and deaths, the world moving on - and I missed every minute of it.\n Mum and Dad looked a lot older than I remembered. Wrinklier, greyer, a sadness in their eyes that hadn\u0027t been there before.\n They thought I was a ghost. Although seven years had slipped by, I looked exactly the way I did when I disappeared, even dressed in the same clothes. Mum screamed. Dad too. They spun away from me, covering their eyes, panting with terror.\n I hadn\u0027t expected such a reaction or prepared myself for the experience of having Mum and Dad scream at me with horror. I fell apart. Collapsed in tears. \"It\u0027s me!\" I kept wailing. \"It\u0027s me! Me! Me!\"\n Eventually, shaking with fear, Dad edged forward. Maybe he wouldn\u0027t have been so brave if I hadn\u0027t been crying like a baby. He poked my bald head, finger trembling, expecting it to slide through me. When it didn\u0027t, he frowned and poked me again.\n \"I\u0027m real,\" I moaned, looking at him, wanting him to hold me, hug me, tell me he loved me. \"It\u0027s me. Kernel. I\u0027m real, Dad. I\u0027m back.\"\n \"Kernel?\" he croaked, shaking his head softly. \"It can\u0027t be. You\u0027re... no... it can\u0027t...\"\n Then he fell on me, folded me in his arms, bellowed my name and burst into tears. Moments later, Mum was beside me too, the pair picking at me, poking me, clutching me. Crying and laughing at the same time.\n I spent ages trying to explain. I told them about the lights, the window, the kidnapping, stepping through after Cadaver, Beranabus, my journey between worlds, Lord Loss, Artery. They didn\u0027t believe me. Couldn\u0027t. But they had no other explanation for how I\u0027d turned up unchanged (except for lots of cuts, scars and bruises).\n \"We should take him to a doctor,\" Dad said. \"Have his body and mind looked at by experts. They might be able to uncover the truth.\"\n \"No!\" Mum hissed before I could insist that my story was the truth. \"He\u0027d be a freak. There\u0027d be questions we don\u0027t want to answer. They\u0027d take him away. We might never see him again, lose him like Annabella and...\" She didn\u0027t say the name of her third child. She refused to discuss Art not being real. Dad didn\u0027t probe either. It was the one part of my story neither asked to hear a second time.\n With no other option, they reluctantly accepted my outlandish tales. But they didn\u0027t tell the neighbours about me. Dad said we\u0027d be treated as lunatics if I repeated my demonic stories. Also, a lot of the people of Paskinston had lost children when Cadaver attacked. He wasn\u0027t sure how my reappearance would affect them.\n They hid me inside the house while they tried to think of a way to introduce me back into village life. Mum wanted to pretend I was an orphaned cousin who just happened to look a lot like their supposedly dead son. Dad played about with a deep-freeze theory - he thought he could convince people that I\u0027d been kept on ice by scientists for the past seven years.\n When they realised how weak those explanations sounded, they decided to simply leave without saying anything. Running away had worked once - why not a second time? Pack our bags, move to where nobody knew us, start afresh. Mum and Dad loved Paskinston, but they loved me more. Stealing away like thieves in the night, saying nothing to any of their friends, seemed like the only solution. So that\u0027s what we did.\n After trying out some small towns, where Mum never felt easy, we ended up in a city. Dad found work on a construction site, Mum in a fast-food restaurant. They teach me when they come home at night. During the day I stay indoors, watching television, reading, playing games, making model aeroplanes. It\u0027s not safe for me to go out and interact with other people. Mum and Dad are afraid I\u0027ll be taken from them if the truth emerges.\n I\u0027m not enjoying this life. It\u0027s not how I thought it would be. I did a brave thing, risked all to save my brother, went through torments and overcame obstacles that most people couldn\u0027t even imagine. But I\u0027m not allowed to talk about it. I have to keep it hidden, like something shameful. We don\u0027t even talk about Art, what happened to him, the fact that he was a demon in disguise. I tried discussing it with Mum once, but she clapped her hands over her ears and shrieked at me to shut up and never mention his name again.\n Mum and Dad aren\u0027t happy either. They don\u0027t say so, but I can see that secretly they wish I\u0027d never returned. Losing me and Art was hard, but after seven years they\u0027d learnt to deal with it. They\u0027d found peace in Paskinston, were getting on with life, grateful to have each other and a place to call home.\n I\u0027ve wrecked all that. Turned their world upside-down and inside out. Forced them to abandon their home and friends, take to the road, live a life of secrets and fear.\n I didn\u0027t want to ruin their lives. I wanted to save Art, bring him home, be a hero. I wanted Mum and Dad to hold me and love me, for everything to be all right after that terrible universe of monsters. I wanted my life back.\n Instead, I\u0027ve returned to lies and disguise, a nightmare every bit as awful as the one I hoped to escape forever when I left the universe of the Demonata.\n The loneliness is worse than ever. Trapped indoors most of the time, nobody to play with or speak to. It was bad enough when I felt like an outsider, but at least I could mingle with other children, go to school, act like I fitted in. Now I\u0027m totally alone. I can\u0027t even talk with Mum or Dad. They\u0027re always uneasy around me. They love me because I\u0027m their son, but I\u0027m sure they wonder sometimes and ask themselves, \"Is that really Kernel? Can it truly be the boy we thought we\u0027d lost? Or is it some monster pretending to be him?\"\n They have nightmares. I\u0027ve heard them moaning in their sleep. Sometimes, one will wake screaming and sob for hours, held by the other, comforted.\n But they never hold or comfort me.\n Out of boredom, I start experimenting with the patches of light. Curious to see if I can manipulate them. Trying to get them to pulse. I don\u0027t want to open a window. I just want to see if I have the power here.\n For a long time I make no progress. But eventually, I find a way. I have to think about a specific spot in the Demonata\u0027s universe, somewhere I\u0027ve been. That gets the lights pulsing, though it takes hours of concentration. Once they\u0027re going, if I think of another place or person, other patches pulse, but slowly, in small numbers. I\u0027m sure I could get more of them to pulse if I pushed myself, and gradually build a window. If I wanted to. Which I don\u0027t. Why would I ever return to that universe of vicious, magical insanity?\n A dark, wet day. Mum and Dad are out at work. They were awake most of last night, crying and talking. I hate seeing them unhappy. I\u0027ve tried everything I can to cheer them up and make it easier. Told jokes, avoided mentioning demons, worked hard at my lessons, kept up a smile whenever they\u0027re around.\n But nothing works. They were delighted when I first returned, but that quickly gave way to a confused sadness and they\u0027re getting sadder every day. They don\u0027t know how to deal with me or this new life they\u0027ve found themselves part of. It\u0027s too complicated.\n They\u0027re starting to resent me. I can see it in their eyes, just a flash, every so often. A look that says they wish I\u0027d never come back. That look strikes at my heart every time I catch it. Makes me want to burst into tears and throw myself at them for a hug. But I hold my smile. Pretend not to notice. Act like everything\u0027s fine. And only cry when they\u0027re not around.\n The clouds part shortly after midday, for a few minutes. Then they roll back together and rain comes down more heavily than before.\n Thinking about the universe of the Demonata. I hated it there, but I didn\u0027t feel out of place. I had a purpose, a function. I was the equal of Sharmila, Dervish, Raz, Shark, Nadia. No good at fighting, but I had other talents. They respected me. Even Beranabus was impressed.\n I remember what he said. \"Home isn\u0027t always where you expect it to be. You know where to find me.\"\n Crazy. As if I\u0027d ever want to go back there, face demons again, live like Nadia, a slave of the magician. Adrift in a universe of horrors, where you can\u0027t even depend on time. Nothing in this world could be as bad as that. Mum and Dad will accept me eventually. I\u0027ll make friends. Grow up normally. We\u0027ll laugh about this one day.\n I\u0027m sitting on the floor in the small living room of the apartment which we\u0027re renting. I rise and walk to the bathroom. Take the marbles out of my pocket, the orange marbles which I\u0027ve carried ever since Art was stolen. I look down at them then hold them up, standing before the mirror. Place them in front of my eyes. Watch them twinkle. I try directing magic into them. Take my fingers away, telling them to hover in the air.\n They fall. Roll away. I hurry after them before they disappear down one of the holes in the old floorboards.\n Back to the living room, remembering how magical I was in that other place, the things I could do, the power I had. Sitting on the couch, I study the marbles again and recall what Sharmila said to me in the field before we parted. I think I know now what she was hinting, the secret she suspected. It\u0027s an impossible, wild and crazy theory. I\u0027m sure it can\u0027t be right. But if it is...\n Trying not to worry too much about what that might mean, I put the marbles away. As I stand, I notice some of the lights around me pulsing slowly. I stare at them numbly. It\u0027s like they\u0027re calling me, trying to suck me back into that realm of madness.\n I turn my back on them and stride around the tiny apartment, looking for something to distract me. End up in my Mum and Dad\u0027s bedroom. Not much bigger than mine. A bed they can only just fit into. I let my eyes drift. It\u0027s untidy, clothes thrown about the place, dirty socks and underwear. The rooms were never like this in our previous homes. Mum was house-proud. Dad too. Always cleaning and tidying away. But not any more.\n The mess upsets me. I turn to leave, but spot the corner of something sticking out from under a pillow on the bed. I edge over and slide it all the way out. It\u0027s a photograph of me and Art. I haven\u0027t seen it before. I\u0027m holding Art over my head. He\u0027s laughing. I think I\u0027m laughing too. But it\u0027s difficult to tell. Because Mum has scrawled all over my face with a pen. Line after line of black ink, obliterating my features, scratching me out of existence.\n I put the photo back in its place. Cover it entirely. Return to the living room, my stomach hard and cold. The lights are pulsing around me, lots of them, faster than before, like they used to in the Demonata\u0027s universe. I think about Beranabus, what Sharmila said, the bitter look I sometimes get from Mum and Dad, the photo.\n As a single tear trickles down my cheek, I reach out like a robot and start slotting the patches of pulsing lights together. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/demon-thief-the-demonata-2/page-28.html","bookId":2176,"book":{"id":2176,"title":"Demon Thief (The Demonata #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Demon Thief (The Demonata #2) \n This story is told through the eyes of lonely child Cornelius \"Kernel\" Fleck and takes place probably somewhere in the United Kingdom or Ireland and during the 1970s.
