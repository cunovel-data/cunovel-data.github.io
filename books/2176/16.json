Even the gruff Shark, who believes in forcing people to work for the Disciples, isn\u0027t used to tyrants like Beranabus.\\n\\n The magician comes over and sits with us. He scratches the sole of his left foot, then runs a hand through his hair and coughs. \"Take no notice of Nadia\u0027s hysterics,\" he says. \"She\u0027ll be all right when she calms down. We\u0027ve had similar confrontations before. Although this is the first time she\u0027s threatened to kill me.\" He laughs harshly. Nobody smiles.\\n\\n \"This isn\u0027t the best of introductions, is it?\" Beranabus notes, looking at me wryly. \"You think I\u0027m a heartless beast. But this is the way life is for me. I have no time for decency. I\u0027m a demon killer. That\u0027s my sole purpose in life. I sleep soundly - on those rare occasions when I sleep - because I know I\u0027m doing the task that the universe charged me with.\" He points at my shoes. \"You might want to get rid of those. You too, Shark and... Deviant?\"\\n\\n \"Dervish.\"\\n\\n \"Aye. Dump the shoes. They block the flow of magic. Even the slightest advantage can be vital when you\u0027re faced with a demon and battling for your life. I\u0027m assuming you two intend to stay and help?\"\\n\\n Shark and Dervish glance at each other edgily. I don\u0027t think either had planned to stay. Then Shark shrugs and raises an eyebrow. Dervish nods in answer and smiles weakly. They bend to untie their laces.\\n\\n Beranabus studies me closely as I peel my socks off. \"You\u0027re a strange one, Kernel Fleck. Normally, I can sense magic in those who possess an abundance of it, but I get almost nothing from you, even though you must be throbbing with power to open windows between worlds so swiftly.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think it\u0027s magic,\" I say shyly. \"It\u0027s like a puzzle. I see lights and I\u0027m able to slot them together when they pulse. That\u0027s the only difference between me and you. I can see the pieces of the window. You can\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"Tell me about these lights,\" Beranabus says. \"When you first noticed them and realised you could manipulate them.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve seen the lights all my life, but it was only on the needle of rock that I realised I could...\" A memory kicks in and I come to a surprised stop. \"No, that\u0027s not right. A year ago, I put lights together in my bedroom, stepped through the window and went missing for a few days.\" I can\u0027t believe I hadn\u0027t remembered that until now.\\n\\n \"Missing?\" Beranabus sniffs.\\n\\n \"Yes. Nobody knew where I was. I don\u0027t know either. I can\u0027t remember what happened when I stepped through the window.\"\\n\\n \"Nothing at all?\" Beranabus presses.\\n\\n I think hard, but even though I now know that I must have crossed into this universe, my mind\u0027s a total blank. There\u0027s something about the window itself, before I stepped through, but the memory evades me. I shake my head.\\n\\n Sharmila has been listening closely. She looks at Beranabus, troubled. \"Does it not strike you as strange that of all the places Cadaver could have emerged, he turned up in that village? The home of the one boy in all the world who has a power which in some ways is greater than even your own.\"\\n\\n \"You think he went there for Kernel?\" Beranabus frowns.\\n\\n \"Perhaps. When we turned up, maybe he thought we were protecting Kernel. So he took the brother instead, gambling that Kernel would chase after him.\"\\n\\n \"A trap,\" Beranabus says, nodding slowly. \"Aye, it could be. Maybe we should forget about Cadaver and - \"\\n\\n \"No!\" I hiss. \"Art\u0027s the only thing in this universe I\u0027m interested in. I don\u0027t care if it\u0027s a trap - I\u0027m going to keep looking for him. Whether you help me or not. I know how now. I\u0027ll use a window to find him.\"\\n\\n Beranabus smiles icily. \"You could have done that as soon as you returned. But you didn\u0027t. Instead you searched for me. Because you need me to snatch your brother back. You can find him, but you can\u0027t fight for him. You want me to risk everything I have - for you. Do you expect me to do that without asking for anything in return?\"\\n\\n I glower at the magician, but what he says is true. I am asking him to risk his life to help me.\\n\\n \"I thought you had to search for this Cadaver demon anyway,\" Dervish says. \"He\u0027s the one who can lead you to the weapon, right?\"\\n\\n \"Perhaps not directly,\" Beranabus says. \"Nadia\u0027s vision wasn\u0027t clear. She said the demon thief could guide us. But perhaps he\u0027s already done that.\"\\n\\n \"You think part of the Kah-Gash is here?\" Sharmila asks, dubiously looking around at the yellowish demon world.\\n\\n \"No. I think Cadaver was only meant to provide us with the means of finding it.\" He fixes his gaze on me. \"You\u0027re the true guide. Cadaver\u0027s role was to lead us to you. Now that we know about your talent, we can use it to search for the Kah-Gash. That\u0027s the deal - help me locate the fragments, then I\u0027ll help you get your brother back.\"\\n\\n I stare at Beranabus nervously. It sounds like a fair trade, but I\u0027m wary. Afraid of ending up like Nadia, a tool in the magician\u0027s hands, a slave. Nobody knows how many pieces the Kah-Gash was broken up into. It could be a handful or it could be a thousand.\\n\\n \"Help me rescue Art now,\" I barter. \"Then I\u0027ll search for the weapon.\"\\n\\n Beranabus shakes his head. \"The Kah-Gash first. You won\u0027t have any reason to help me once you have your brother back. You could open a window and slip away from me any time you wished.\"\\n\\n I think it over carefully, not wanting to tie myself to a deal which might backfire on me later. I\u0027ve never had to bargain like this before. It\u0027s strange. Confusing. Frightening. But I force myself to concentrate and think all the options through.\\n\\n \"One piece,\" I say quietly. \"I\u0027ll help you search for it. Then we go after Cadaver and Art. That\u0027s fair.\"\\n\\n Beranabus scowls and starts to argue.\\n\\n \"He is right,\" Sharmila heads him off. \"That is an equal exchange. An eye for an eye, so to speak.\"\\n\\n Beranabus makes a grumbling sound. \"It\u0027s not equal. That\u0027s like me saying I\u0027ll help you rescue one of your brother\u0027s legs. You want the whole boy - well, I want the whole Kah-Gash.\"\\n\\n \"But I could spend the rest of my life looking for all the pieces!\" I cry.\\n\\n Beranabus rolls his eyes. \"Very well,\" he says reluctantly. \"Find the first piece. Then we rescue your brother. Then you help me find the rest of it.\"\\n\\n \"No!\" Sharmila snaps. \"You can\u0027t ask that of him.\"\\n\\n \"I can and I did,\" Beranabus retorts without taking his eyes off me. \"Of course, I can\u0027t hold you to that promise, but I\u0027ll trust you to keep your word if you give it.\"\\n\\n I hesitate. My gaze slides to Nadia, still sitting with her back to us, crying. To spend years here like she has, fighting demons, never return home... Do I love Art that much? Would I sacrifice all that I have to save him?\\n\\n \"It may not take as long as you think,\" Beranabus says. \"There might only be a few pieces of the Kah-Gash. Maybe we\u0027ll find them within weeks or months. Once I have the weapon, I\u0027ll be able to destroy the demon universe. You can go home. Lead a normal, happy, human life.\"\\n\\n I nod slowly, deciding. \"OK.\" Beranabus breaks into a smile. \"But you\u0027ve got to agree to help me even if I can\u0027t find the Kah-Gash.\"\\n\\n The magician\u0027s smile vanishes. \"Why wouldn\u0027t you be able to find it?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know if I can search for objects. Maybe I can only open windows to people or demons. If I can find it, I will. But if I search and I can\u0027t, I want your word that you\u0027ll still help me.\"\\n\\n Beranabus considers that. \"Very well.\"\\n\\n Solemnly, seriously, we shake on the deal. And I try hard not to think about the legend of Faust.\\n\\n I move apart from the others. Study the patches of light, all sorts of sizes, shapes and colours. I try not to dwell on the deal. I have to put Art\u0027s needs before my own, then hope for the best later.\\n\\n And if you have to spend the rest of your life in servitude to Beranabus? a voice says within me.\\n\\n I can\u0027t worry about that now. What will be, will be. Art first - after the Kah-Gash.\\n\\n I\u0027m not sure how to look for it, since I\u0027ve no idea what exactly it is that I\u0027m searching for. I run the name through my thoughts, studying the lights, hoping some will pulse. But they don\u0027t.\\n\\n I clear my thoughts and try another approach. I think about an object - a tree that I used to climb when I lived in the city. Dozens of lights pulse. I let the image of the tree fade, wait for the lights to return to normal, then experiment again, this time trying to think of an object I\u0027m not familiar with.\\n\\n It\u0027s not as easy as it sounds. I think of famous buildings, cities, Mount Everest. But while I haven\u0027t been to those places, I have an image of each inside my head, and when that image pops up, the lights start pulsing.\\n\\n \"Tell me the names of some strange places or things that I won\u0027t know about,\" I say to Beranabus and the others.\\n\\n \"Why?\" Beranabus asks.\\n\\n \"Just do it. Please. It\u0027s important.\"\\n\\n \"The Taj Mahal,\" Sharmila says.\\n\\n \"No. I\u0027ve seen pictures of that.\"\\n\\n \"My bedroom,\" Dervish says with a laugh.\\n\\n \"No. Something specific, with a unique name.\"\\n\\n There\u0027s a pause, then Beranabus says softly, \"Newgrange.\"\\n\\n \"Perfect!\" I haven\u0027t the slightest idea what that means. Focusing on the word, I stare at the lights and murmur, \"Newgrange, Newgrange, Newgrange.\" I keep repeating it, mind blank of images, having only the name to work with.\\n\\n Several lights pulse, then others, and more drift towards me from points further away. I slot the patches together. When a deep blue window forms, I ask Beranabus to step through with me.\\n\\n \"Why are we going to Newgrange?\" he asks.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m testing my powers.\"\\n\\n As soon as we emerge, I know we\u0027re back in the real world. It\u0027s a grey, wet day. Ahead of us stands a strange structure, a long, white brick wall with a doorway in it, a grass mound for a roof.\\n\\n \"Is that Newgrange?\" I ask.\\n\\n \"Aye,\" Beranabus says, a soft smile on his lips. \"It was built by the Old Creatures, beings of amazing magic. They kept this world safe from the Demonata for thousands of years. When they moved on, their power passed with them, leaving us open to attacks. I resented their passing when I was younger, but now I think they had to leave, that humans have a destiny of their own, which they must follow by themselves.\"\\n\\n I don\u0027t really understand that, but it doesn\u0027t matter. What I know is that I can use the lights to search for objects which I\u0027m not familiar with. Armed with that knowledge, I retreat through the window, to search once again for the mysterious Kah-Gash.\\n\\n I spend several minutes running the word through my thoughts, but the lights don\u0027t respond. Not even a shimmer.\\n\\n \"Does the weapon have another name?\" I ask Beranabus.\\n\\n \"Possibly. Demons speak many languages. But most refer to it as the Kah-Gash.\"\\n\\n I try for maybe a quarter of an hour, then give up. \"It\u0027s no good. I can\u0027t find it. Either it doesn\u0027t exist or I\u0027m not able to locate it without further information.\"\\n\\n Beranabus\u0027 face darkens. \"If you\u0027re trying to play me for a fool...\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not. The lights aren\u0027t pulsing. I\u0027ve tried my hardest, but nothing\u0027s happening.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe you need to give it more time,\" Beranabus suggests.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not how it worked with the other windows. If I could find your weapon, the lights would have started pulsing by now. I can\u0027t do it.\"\\n\\n Beranabus mutters something to himself and tugs irritably at his beard.\\n\\n Sharmila is looking at me, head cocked, frowning. She starts to say something, then changes her mind and instead says, \"We must search for Cadaver again.\"\\n\\n \"To rescue the child?\" Beranabus sneers.\\n\\n \"Yes. But also to question the demon. Perhaps he knows another word for the Kah-Gash, which will enable Kernel to locate it.\"\\n\\n \"Or maybe Nadia was wrong,\" Beranabus says, glaring at his assistant\u0027s back. \"Maybe this is a wild goose chase.\"\\n\\n Sharmila shrugs. \"Perhaps. But if we are to continue, it seems logical to make Cadaver our target.\"\\n\\n Beranabus thinks it over, then pins his gaze on me. \"Look at me directly and tell me you can\u0027t find the Kah-Gash.\"\\n\\n I don\u0027t like him calling me a liar, but I let our eyes meet and say, \"I searched for it honestly. I couldn\u0027t find it.\" I hold his gaze, trying not to blink.\\n\\n Beranabus scowls. \"Very well. We\u0027ll pick up Cadaver\u0027s trail and hope he hasn\u0027t laid any more traps for us. Go ahead then, boy. Find him.\"\\n\\n \"First, you have to promise to help me rescue Art.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t worry,\" Beranabus huffs. \"We\u0027ll do all we can to save your little brother. If he\u0027s still alive.\" He spits spitefully. \"Which I very much doubt.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/demon-thief-the-demonata-2/page-16.html","bookId":2176,"book":{"id":2176,"title":"Demon Thief (The Demonata #2)","description":"Storyline: Demon Thief (The Demonata #2) \\n This story is told through the eyes of lonely child Cornelius \"Kernel\" Fleck and takes place probably somewhere in the United Kingdom or Ireland and during the 1970s.
