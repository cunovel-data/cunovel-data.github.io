{"id":99402,"no":23,"title":"Page 23","content":"We march slowly but steadily, saying little, following the marbles. I try to keep track of time and distance, but it\u0027s impossible. Sometimes, I wish a demon would attack, just to break the monotony, but we see none of Lord Loss\u0027 familiars. We can\u0027t even sleep - our bodies get weary, but we can\u0027t shut off our brains.\\n\\n Eventually, we come to a point where two enormous black panels meet at a ninety degree angle and run up to the roof of yellowish sky. The panels are several feet wide and half a foot thick. They stand alone in the rocky surroundings, eerily out of place.\\n\\n \"Have you seen the film 2001: A Space Odyssey?\" Dervish asks after a minute of silence.\\n\\n \"No. Why?\"\\n\\n \"This reminds me of it.\" He walks round the black pillars, squinting at them, then says in a curiously flat voice, \"Good morning, Dave.\"\\n\\n \"Who\u0027s Dave?\"\\n\\n Dervish laughs. \"Doesn\u0027t matter.\" He looks at me, eyebrow cocked. \"What do you think they are?\"\\n\\n \"A place where four squares of the Board meet.\"\\n\\n \"Me too. But why just these weird slivers of black? I would have expected walls stretching the entire length of the boundaries.\"\\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t we step through one and see? I mean, we\u0027ll have to anyway, since the marbles were heading that way.\" The marbles stopped when we did, and now hang a few inches short of the black panel on our left.\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s try the right panel first,\" Dervish suggests. \"Just for the hell of it.\"\\n\\n \"OK.\" I pick the marbles out of the air and put them in my pocket.\\n\\n Dervish tests the panel, sticking a hand through to make sure we can pass. \"It\u0027s OK,\" he says. \"We - \"\\n\\n Suddenly, with a startled grunt, he disappears, hauled through the panel by something on the other side. I scream his name. When there\u0027s no response, I dart into the darkness after him.\\n\\n It\u0027s not pitch-black like the maze, but very dark. I get glimpses of a demon wrapping itself round Dervish. Tentacles covered in long, glistening blades, slicing away at Dervish, cutting him open, blood flying in every direction.\\n\\n I jam my hand into my trouser pocket. Yank out both marbles. Scream a word of magic at them, the word coming from somewhere deep inside me. Light flares, sharp and fierce in its orange brightness. I yell another word of magic as the light bursts forth, directing all the rays towards the demon.\\n\\n The demon shrieks with pain from the explosion of light. It has dozens of eyes, a necessity in this dark kingdom, but a handicap when strong light\u0027s trained on it. With another agonised cry, it releases Dervish and hurls itself away, sheltering its eyes with its tentacles.\\n\\n I grab Dervish and throw him back through the panel, which is white on this side. Then I reverse out after him, at the last possible second commanding the marbles to follow, stepping through at the same time as they slip out of the dark zone, so I don\u0027t lose track of them.\\n\\n Dervish is on the volcanic floor, healing his wounds with magic, angry for being caught out so easily. \"Thanks,\" he mutters.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t worry about it.\" I squat next to him. \"Can I help?\"\\n\\n \"No. I\u0027ll be fine once I patch myself up.\"\\n\\n \"A few of your spikes were cut off,\" I tell him, tapping his head.\\n\\n \"Maybe I\u0027d be better off bald like you,\" he laughs, then makes the hair grow back to its proper length.\\n\\n When he\u0027s healed himself, he stands, checks for any cuts he might have missed, then warily faces the other black panel. \"There could be a similar monster through there. Or worse.\"\\n\\n I say nothing. I want to volunteer to go ahead of him, to test the waters, but I\u0027m afraid. Sheepishly hoping Dervish will take the lead.\\n\\n Dervish breathes out through his nose, then glances at me. \"Ready to save my bacon again?\"\\n\\n \"If I have to,\" I chuckle then give the order for the marbles to lead us to Shark. They float through the panel into blackness. We follow.\\n\\n Space. Freezing emptiness. Not even air. A moment of complete dizziness and suffocating panic. Then instinct makes me surround myself with a force field of warmth and air. Dervish has done the same and is floating beside me, staring around with happy wonder. His mouth moves, but I can\u0027t hear what he\u0027s saying. I point to my ears and shake my head. He tries again, then makes a tube of air grow from his force field to mine. When it touches, he speaks and this time I hear him. \"I always wanted to be a spaceman, like Flash Gordon. It was my dream.\"\\n\\n \"Me too,\" I smile. \"Except I wanted to be a real astronaut, like Neil Armstrong or Buzz Aldrin. Walk on the moon.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s bizarre, isn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah. Like when we were on top of the cloud, but stranger.\"\\n\\n Dervish does a slow somersault. It looks graceful at first, but he can\u0027t stop and keeps tumbling over and over. He yells for help, but I\u0027m laughing too much at the freewheeling punk. Finally, he finds his balance, rights himself and glares at me. \"Thanks for the help!\"\\n\\n \"Do it again,\" I coo. \"Whirl for me, Dervish, whirl!\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll whirl my foot up your ass,\" he grumbles, then looks for the marbles. \"Let\u0027s go find Shark.\"\\n\\n \"OK. But if you want to try your hand at gymnastics again, I\u0027ll be more than happy to - \"\\n\\n \"Keep it up,\" he growls. \"Keep it up!\"\\n\\n Laughing, I give the marbles their freedom and we drift forward again, leaving behind a pair of small white panels, glowing softly in the vacuum of sterile space.\\n\\n I was wrong about this space being sterile. Though there don\u0027t seem to be any planets, the marbles eventually lead us towards a demon of unbelievable size. It\u0027s one of the vast sky demons. From the ground they looked huge, but up here it goes beyond words like massive and immense. This one must be hundreds of miles long, fifty or sixty high, a comet-sized, slug-like demon, drifting through the void of space in search of... what? Demons to kill and devour? Foes to fight? A world to settle on?\\n\\n Dervish and I pause when the marbles home in on the demon. We look at each other bleakly. \"If that thing spots us...\" Dervish whispers.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re too small,\" I whisper back, even though there\u0027s no need - sound can\u0027t carry in space, so we should be able to speak as loudly as we like. \"It won\u0027t bother with a couple of ants like us.\"\\n\\n \"Unless it enjoys squashing ants.\"\\n\\n We want to pull back, detour around it or wait for it to pass. But the marbles keep tugging after the demon, urging us to follow. Since we\u0027ve no other option, we glide after them as they lead us ever closer to the terrifying behemoth.\\n\\n We come up underneath the monster\u0027s bulging stomach, which looks more like rock than flesh. The marbles pause next to the stomach wall. I get the sense they want to penetrate the demon\u0027s crusty shell. But then they take a turn and lead us forward, towards the creature\u0027s head.\\n\\n Half an hour later, we float up from beneath the demon\u0027s gigantic lower jaw. I\u0027m worried that, this close, the monster can\u0027t help but see us. But there\u0027s no evidence of any eyes. Either they\u0027re set much higher up its face or it\u0027s blind.\\n\\n But there\u0027s definitely a mouth, running like a ridged valley from one side of the head to the other. Lips parted, teeth the size of large houses set in the rocky gums at irregular intervals. A tongue crawling with scores of smaller, parasitical demons, feeding on the remains of whatever this monster eats.\\n\\n And amidst those demons, fighting for his life - Shark.\\n\\n The warrior is in poor shape. These demons are weak compared with some of the others we\u0027ve fought, small in size and power. But there are hundreds of them and they keep coming at him, fresh scavengers replacing the dead almost as soon as they\u0027ve fallen. They\u0027re like tiny piranha bringing down a mighty ox.\\n\\n \"Shark!\" Dervish bellows, but of course he can\u0027t hear. Dervish looks sideways at me, tilting his head instead of asking the question outright.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m ready if you are,\" I tell him, though my stomach\u0027s tight with nerves.\\n\\n \"If the giant closes its mouth, I don\u0027t know if we could get out. Maybe only one of us should - \"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t tempt me,\" I stop him. \"You and Shark risked everything to help me. It\u0027s only fair I do the same in return. So don\u0027t give me the option of cutting out on you now. I\u0027m afraid I might take it.\"\\n\\n Dervish grins. \"Then let\u0027s go for a dip in the mouth of Moby Dick!\"\\n\\n Cavernous. No smells or sounds. Just the spectacle of legions of vicious demons wriggling over and around one another to take turns attacking the lonely but resilient Shark. They spot us when we enter. Dozens peel away from the main assault and hurl themselves at us. Small, furry, dark demons, like tumbleweed with claws and fangs. We swat them aside without slowing. We\u0027ve come too far and seen too much to be scared by these hangers-on.\\n\\n Shark glances up as we close in on him. His eyes are distant and I see that he thinks we\u0027re another couple of demons. He aims a fist at me, but I stop out of range. Dervish dips lower, trying to direct a tube of air at Shark so they can communicate. But Shark must think it\u0027s a tendril or tongue. He ducks, throws demons at Dervish, edges away from him, further back from the mouth. I flash on an image of what would happen if the monster swallows now. Quickly try to purge my mind of it.\\n\\n I slip behind Shark and send out a tube of my own, all the time battling the demons. Shark spots the tube, dodges it, then leaps, hands outstretched, intent on throttling me.\\n\\n Dervish flies forward and collides with Shark. They crash into me and our limbs get entangled. Now that we\u0027re touching, sharing our force fields, we can hear Shark. He\u0027s screaming madly, vile curses, words that make no sense, desperation and isolation thick in his throat.\\n\\n \"Shark!\" Dervish roars. \"It\u0027s us! Dervish and Kernel! We\u0027ve come to rescue you. Stop fighting. We can get you out of here.\"\\n\\n Shark screams in response, raises a large tattooed fist to pound Dervish flat, then pauses, faint lines of realisation rippling across his face.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s really us, Shark,\" I tell him. \"This isn\u0027t a trick. We came for you.\"\\n\\n \"Impossible,\" he croaks. \"How could you get here? You\u0027re illusions. Lord Loss sent you to torment me with hope.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be a dope,\" Dervish snaps. \"Could any illusion look this good?\"\\n\\n Shark blinks - then grins. \"How?\" he whispers. \"How did you find me?\"\\n\\n \"We used magic.\"\\n\\n \"But it\u0027s empty space out there.\"\\n\\n \"So?\"\\n\\n \"You mean... all this time... I could have left? I wasn\u0027t trapped? I didn\u0027t have to spend months... years... whatever... fighting these horrible furballs?\"\\n\\n \"Nope,\" Dervish says lightly.\\n\\n Shark\u0027s expression darkens. He grabs one of the demons and rips it to pieces, then uses its fur to wipe blood from his face. When he tosses the rag away, his features are composed. He sniffs as if what\u0027s happened is no big deal. \"So much for the tour,\" he says casually. \"Let\u0027s go find a bar.\"\\n\\n Laughing, Dervish pats Shark on the back, points him towards the open mouth and guides him out of the maw of the monster, away from the gnashing teeth of the furious furry creatures, into the empty depths of darkest, coldest space.\\n\\n Floating, the monster having drifted on, we tell Shark about our adventures and theory that we\u0027re in a chess board-shaped universe of thirty-two different zones. He listens quietly, distracted, looking around twitchily. Sighs when we finish, then says softly, \"Thanks for coming.\"\\n\\n \"We need you,\" Dervish says.\\n\\n \"For what?\" Shark snorts. \"You were doing fine without me. You figured this place out and dealt with it. All I did was stay where I had something solid underfoot. I thought that was going to be the rest of my life, that mouth and those demons. Part of me wanted to surrender and let them...\"\\n\\n He shivers, looking very different from the Shark I first met. The fight has drained him of much of his confidence and strength. I want to say something to make him feel better, but Dervish speaks before I can put my words together.\\n\\n \"I think Lord Loss knows you\u0027re the strongest of us. He wanted to break you, wear you down and kill you off, so you couldn\u0027t help Kernel. That\u0027s why he stuck you in the bleakest spot he could find and did all he could to destroy you. But he failed. You\u0027re alive. You survived where any other would have perished. So forget the self-pity. You had it tough, you dealt with it - now move on, soldier.\"\\n\\n Shark laughs. \"Nice speech.\"\\n\\n \"But true,\" Dervish adds.\\n\\n \"Maybe.\" Shark\u0027s laugh turns to a chuckle. \"I guess I\u0027m not cut out to suffer nobly, am I?\"\\n\\n \"No. You\u0027ve had your few minutes of moping - now put them behind you and let\u0027s work on getting out of this place and finding that bar you mentioned.\"\\n\\n Shark grunts and faces me, recovering in the blink of an eye. I wish I had skin as thick as his, that I could go from the depths of despair to normality in the space of a few heartbeats. \"Are those marbles still working?\" he asks.\\n\\n \"I guess.\"\\n\\n \"Think you can use them to find this thief of yours?\"\\n\\n \"Possibly.\"\\n\\n \"Then set the hounds loose, boy - it\u0027s time to kick demonic ass!\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/demon-thief-the-demonata-2/page-23.html","bookId":2176,"book":{"id":2176,"title":"Demon Thief (The Demonata #2)","description":"Storyline: Demon Thief (The Demonata #2) \\n This story is told through the eyes of lonely child Cornelius \"Kernel\" Fleck and takes place probably somewhere in the United Kingdom or Ireland and during the 1970s.
