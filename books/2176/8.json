{"id":101088,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"Beranabus is still working on his spells. Trying to find Cadaver and open a window which will lead us to the creature. According to Nadia there are thousands of demon worlds like this. Cadaver could be on almost any of them.\\n\\n I\u0027m squatting with the Disciples in a semi-circle. We can\u0027t sit down because of the water. They look tired and upset. Sharmila argued with Beranabus for a long time, insisting he send me back. She said he was irresponsible and vile. He just swore and told her not to tell him his business. He said when she\u0027d lived as long as he had, and seen all the things he\u0027d seen, she could lecture him - but only then.\\n\\n I study the Disciples while Beranabus works. Sharmila\u0027s the eldest, fifty or more (though I\u0027m not very good at guessing ages). She has a painted red spot in the middle of her forehead. I should know the name for it, but I can\u0027t remember. Wrinkly skin. Dark, soft eyes. A long sari, many colours, ripped in several places and stained round the edges with blood and dirt.\\n\\n Raz is fat and black. His skin\u0027s incredibly dark. If it was night, no moon and he shut his eyes, he\u0027d be invisible. Tight, curly hair. Not overly tall. Maybe in his thirties. He wears a very fine suit. I think he\u0027s wealthy - he looks like someone who hasn\u0027t worked with his hands a lot. No shoes - none of the Disciples wears shoes or socks.\\n\\n Nadia is in her late teens or early twenties. She has short blonde hair, blue eyes and very bad skin. Lots of spots and acne scars. A hard, plain face. She wouldn\u0027t be especially pretty even if she had the clearest skin in the world. Plump, but with bony legs and arms. She wears jeans and a dark green jumper. Looks unhappy, as though she\u0027s suffered a lot.\\n\\n Nadia catches me watching her and smiles. Her whole face changes. She looks a lot prettier. \"Strange days, huh, Kernel Fleck?\"\\n\\n \"I still don\u0027t understand it all,\" I mutter. \"Actually, I don\u0027t really understand any of it.\"\\n\\n Nadia laughs. \"At least you\u0027re honest.\" She chews a fingernail, considering what to say. Eventually, she gestures at the elderly man on his feet. \"That\u0027s Beranabus. He\u0027s a magician. There aren\u0027t many of them in the world. Lots of people can do some magic if the situation is right, but only a few are born with full magical powers.\"\\n\\n \"He is our master,\" Raz says, gazing at Beranabus adoringly. \"He unites us, gives us direction, shows us the way.\"\\n\\n \"He is an egotistical, reckless fool!\" Sharmila disagrees, snorting harshly. \"He cares nothing for any person\u0027s life. He claims to be on a greater mission to save the world, but I have my doubts. I do not trust him and I advise you to be cautious also, Kernel.\"\\n\\n \"But isn\u0027t he your leader?\" I ask, confused.\\n\\n \"Yes. But we follow him reluctantly, not out of choice.\" She looks at Raz and smiles. \"Well, some of us do.\"\\n\\n Raz and Sharmila start arguing about Beranabus\u0027 faults and strong points. Nadia listens for a while, then shuffles away from them and nods for me to follow.\\n\\n \"They\u0027re new to this,\" she says quietly when we\u0027re out of earshot. \"Beranabus has always been a legendary figure to them. They haven\u0027t spent time around him, so they\u0027re not sure how to respond to his... peculiarities. Raz over-idolises him. Sharmila criticises. But he doesn\u0027t care what people say or think, as long as they obey his orders.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve been with him a long time?\" I ask and she nods. \"Is he your father or something?\"\\n\\n Nadia laughs. \"No, he\u0027s just...\" She pauses and chews another fingernail. \"We\u0027ve all been where you are now. Sharmila, Raz and I led normal lives once. We sensed we were different, not completely like other people. But we had families and friends, jobs and dreams. We were ordinary. Happy. Then, one way or another, we found out about the Demonata.\"\\n\\n \"The demons?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. That\u0027s their proper name - Demonata. They exist in a multi-world universe of their own. They\u0027ve been around as long as mankind, maybe longer. Evil, murderous creatures, who revel in torment and slaughter. They try to cross over into our world all the time, but most are either too weak or too strong.\"\\n\\n \"Too strong?\" I frown.\\n\\n \"You stepped through a window to get here,\" she explains. \"Windows are the most common way of moving between universes, but they\u0027re limited in size. Larger, stronger demons can\u0027t squeeze through. There are other ways to cross - tunnels can be created - but they\u0027re rare.\\n\\n \"Anyway, demons are real and they like nothing better than to cross into our world and murder humans. They\u0027re usually unable to stay in our universe more than a few minutes, so they only have time to kill a handful of people. They\u0027ve slaughtered hundreds of thousands over the centuries, but for the most part we\u0027ve escaped pretty lightly, protected by the laws of physics.\"\\n\\n Nadia glances at Beranabus, still working to find Cadaver. The patches of light have stopped gliding towards him, but there are lots in the air around the magician, pulsing at different speeds. As he chants spells, pieces slot together, joining in a panel forming in front of him. It\u0027s strange that only I can see the lights, but I don\u0027t comment on that in case I break Nadia\u0027s train of thought.\\n\\n \"Centuries ago, a few mages - people with magical talents, but not true magicians - decided to actively combat the demons,\" Nadia continues. \"They studied the disturbances created in advance of a demon crossing to our universe. If they could predict their coming, they could stop the beasts or fight them when they entered our world. They recruited other mages, then approached Beranabus and tried - \"\\n\\n \"Wait a minute,\" I interrupt. \"You said this happened hundreds of years ago.\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"But...\" I stare at the elderly, bearded magician. He looks maybe sixty or more, but nothing like a guy in his hundreds, assuming a man could live that long - which is impossible.\\n\\n \"Time works differently in the Demonata\u0027s universe,\" Nadia says. \"It can move more slowly or quickly, depending on where you are. But normally it\u0027s slower. An hour here could be a day or more on Earth. A week could be a year. You could spend three or four years here and return to a brand new century. Or spend ten years here and return to a world which has only moved on by a week.\\n\\n \"But humans can\u0027t survive in this universe. Even real magicians fall foul of the demon forces. Several have tried to extend their natural lifespan by coming here, but they\u0027ve all been ripped to shreds by the Demonata. Except Beranabus. He\u0027s strong enough to fight the demons as an equal, to survive among them. He\u0027s a few hundred years old. At least.\"\\n\\n Raz and Sharmila have stopped arguing. Raz moves close to his master, in case he needs help. Sharmila comes to squat by Nadia and me, and listens as Nadia continues her explanations.\\n\\n \"The mages who wanted to fight the Demonata contacted Beranabus. He\u0027d been fighting demons long before they came along, but usually in this universe. He saw it as his duty to prevent the stronger demons from building tunnels and crossing over. He focused on the demon masters - the ones who could destroy our world if they found a way across.\"\\n\\n \"Have you ever fought a demon master?\" Sharmila asks Nadia.\\n\\n \"Not yet,\" she says and a troubled expression flits across her face. She falls silent and starts chewing her nails again, biting hard. Sharmila squeezes the younger woman\u0027s shoulder, then takes up the story. She has a soft but firm voice.\\n\\n \"The mages asked Beranabus to teach them his ways. They wanted to study his methods, so they could fight the stronger demons too. He told them he was not interested in being their teacher. But they were persistent. Dogged him. Begged to become his students, to learn, to help.\\n\\n \"Finally, because he was tired of being bothered, or because he thought they might serve some good, he agreed.\\n\\n \"He let a few travel with him through this universe, showed them how to fight, helped them understand more about their enemies. They passed that knowledge on, teaching others how to destroy windows before they were fully formed, how to fight demons who made it through. Although often, when a demon crosses, it is better not to engage them directly, just try to limit the damage.\"\\n\\n She pauses and shrugs stiffly. \"That is not the way we like it, but it is the way it must be. There are too few of us to take risks. Better we avoid direct conflict, and prevent other crossings, than fight, perish and leave the demons free to come as they please. Some disagree with that and take the fight to the Demonata, but they do not last very long.\"\\n\\n \"You tried fighting when you were younger,\" Nadia says, and Sharmila nods. \"That\u0027s why Beranabus recruited you. You and Raz have fought demons. He knows he can take advantage of your nobler nature.\" She chuckles dryly and shoots Beranabus a dark look. I realise she doesn\u0027t like the ancient magician. Maybe even hates him. But in that case, why does she work for him? Before I can ask, Nadia picks up the story again.\\n\\n \"The mages called themselves the Disciples, to honour Beranabus. He didn\u0027t care about that, but to them it was important. It still is. Their followers have kept the name. There are never many Disciples - maybe forty or fifty at any time. They patrol the world, thwarting the plans of lesser demons, searching for other humans with powers like their own, to recruit, train and set against the Demonata.\"\\n\\n \"Mostly we act independently of the master,\" Raz says and all our heads bob up. He\u0027s standing over me, rubbing his hands together, smiling. \"We were not properly introduced earlier. My name is Raz Warlo. This is Sharmila Mukherji. And Nadia Moore. We are - I\u0027m sure I speak for us all - delighted to meet you, and will do all in our power to make you feel that you are among friends and allies.\"\\n\\n Sharmila laughs shortly. \"Always the diplomat, Raz.\"\\n\\n \"One of us needs to be,\" he laughs back, then squats. \"As I said, the Disciples mostly act without orders from the master. He leaves us free to operate as we see fit. Occasionally, he\u0027ll assign one of us a task, perhaps to watch for signs of demonic activity in a certain area, or to come into this universe with him to fight. But mostly we follow our own path.\"\\n\\n \"Lucky you,\" Nadia says bitterly and shoots another harsh look at Beranabus.\\n\\n \"Are you his... slave?\" I ask hesitantly.\\n\\n \"I might as well be,\" she spits, then smiles painfully. \"No. Beranabus is a real son of a bitch, but I\u0027m free to leave if I wish. I\u0027m different from Raz, Sharmila and the rest of the Disciples - more gifted. Not necessarily more powerful, but I can...\" She trails off and glances at Raz and Sharmila, who are staring at her curiously. They don\u0027t know this bit either.\\n\\n Nadia sniffs. \"It\u0027s not a secret. Beranabus didn\u0027t tell you because there wasn\u0027t time. He won\u0027t mind if I fill you in. And I think I should because it concerns you and Raz too. It\u0027s the reason you\u0027re here.\"\\n\\n \"I have been curious about that,\" Sharmila says, and though Raz says nothing, I can see that he\u0027s intrigued also.\\n\\n Nadia rubs her arms, shivering slightly. \"I\u0027ve been with Beranabus a long time, maybe seven or eight years - though it\u0027s been a lot longer than that in the human world. When Beranabus recruited me, talking movies had just come into fashion. It was 1929.\"\\n\\n We gawp at her. Sharmila covers her mouth with a hand. Raz blinks owlishly.\\n\\n \"1929?\" I echo. \"But you\u0027re so young.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve spent most of those seven or eight years here, where - as I\u0027ve explained - time works differently.\"\\n\\n \"You mean you missed the Second World War?\" Raz asks. \"Rock and roll? The Beatles?\"\\n\\n \"Beetles?\" Nadia asks innocently.\\n\\n \"The Beatles. The biggest band in the world. They...\" He stops, not sure how to explain the Beatles to somebody from 1929.\\n\\n \"Poor girl,\" Sharmila says, tears of pity in her eyes.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not so bad.\" Nadia shrugs uncomfortably. \"When we return to the human world, we stay in a cave which has been Beranabus\u0027 base for many centuries. I haven\u0027t seen the outside world since I joined him. I\u0027m not jealous or regretful. Not really.\"\\n\\n She tries to make it sound like she honestly feels that way, but it\u0027s clear that she\u0027s deeply unhappy.\\n\\n \"Why?\" Raz asks softly. \"Why did the master ask this great sacrifice of you? What is your gift?\"\\n\\n \"Fortune-telling,\" Nadia says with a giggle. \"I was a child fortune-teller. I\u0027d dress up as a gypsy and read people\u0027s palms, tea leaves, a crystal ball - whatever. When my parents realised I could make money doing it, they set up a special room in our house. Later, they took me on the road with a travelling fair. I had a tent of my own. They billed me as Nadia Le Tarot. It was fun, but frightening sometimes - I could see people\u0027s death. I was supposed to just tell them good things, but if I saw something upsetting, I couldn\u0027t always hide it. That got me into trouble.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know how Beranabus found me. He just turned up one night, and whisked me off into the madness of this. I was terrified. I didn\u0027t know who he was or what he wanted. And all the demons...\"\\n\\n She shudders and glares at Beranabus. I try to imagine what that must have been like. It\u0027s not difficult, since I\u0027m in much the same boat as she was. But at least I made the decision to come here.\\n\\n \"In time, I learnt why Beranabus took me,\" Nadia says. \"I can sense things which have not yet happened. There are many people who claim that gift, but I\u0027m one of the few who can really do it. Beranabus says my kind are even rarer than magicians.\"\\n\\n \"How much can you see?\" Sharmila asks, and there\u0027s an edge to her voice. \"Can you see when we will die? And by what means?\"\\n\\n Nadia shakes her head. \"Not yet. I have to focus to gain insights like that. And I prefer not to. I don\u0027t like knowing such details.\"\\n\\n \"You say you can see the future before it happens,\" Raz says slowly. \"But if that is true, surely you can act to change it.\"\\n\\n \"No. It\u0027s not that specific. I might, for instance, see that you\u0027ll die in a fire, but I won\u0027t know when or where it will happen. My insights are never something that can be altered. If I get a glimpse of a future event, it\u0027s because it has in some way already happened. It can\u0027t be undone or prevented.\\n\\n \"But it is possible to use my gift to our advantage - that is, to Beranabus\u0027 advantage.\" She goes quiet, staring at her fingernails. Most are bitten down to the quick, except the smallest nail on her left hand. Maybe she\u0027s saving it for an especially stressful moment.\\n\\n \"There is a weapon,\" Nadia whispers, and we have to lean in to hear. \"A demonic weapon, maybe legendary, maybe real - Beranabus doesn\u0027t know. They call it the Kah-Gash. According to the legends it\u0027s ancient, even by the standards of the Demonata. We\u0027re talking millions of years. It was broken up into a number of pieces aeons ago and they\u0027ve been missing ever since.\"\\n\\n \"How many pieces?\" Raz asks.\\n\\n \"We don\u0027t know. We don\u0027t think any demon knows either. But certain demon masters have been looking for them ever since. Beranabus is searching for the pieces too. Because whatever the Kah-Gash is, the legends claim it has the power to destroy universes. They say it can wipe out either the universe of the Demonata and every demon in it - or our own, and everyone in that.\"\\n\\n \"What weapon could be so powerful?\" Raz gasps. \"Even a nuclear missile cannot destroy an entire universe.\"\\n\\n Nadia shrugs. \"If I had the answer, I\u0027d know more than Beranabus or any of the Demonata. But I know this much - one of the pieces will soon be found. I\u0027ve seen it.\" She starts chewing at the smallest nail on her left hand. \"Beranabus has had me concentrating on the Kah-Gash ever since he brought me here. I spend hours of every day brooding about it, running the word through my thoughts, trying to find out where the pieces might be.\\n\\n \"A few days ago I had an insight. I sensed that part of the Kah-Gash was going to be discovered in the near future. I caught a glimpse of a demon - Cadaver. Words popped into my thoughts - \u0027The demon thief will guide you. Find the thief.\u0027 \"\\n\\n Find the thief. That\u0027s what Mrs. Egin said when she was freaking out, and just before she exploded! I start to tell the others, but Sharmila speaks up before me.\\n\\n \"Cadaver stole the baby - Kernel\u0027s brother.\"\\n\\n Nadia nods. \"Beranabus was ecstatic when that happened. It confirmed that we were on the right track, that Cadaver was a demon thief.\"\\n\\n \"So that\u0027s what this is about,\" Raz says, nudging my right arm. (It doesn\u0027t hurt now. It\u0027s been healed by magic.) \"Nadia and the master came for me - having already collected Sharmila - a day or so ago. The master said he had need of me, but didn\u0027t say what he wanted me for. Now I see - it was to help search for the Kah-Gash.\"\\n\\n \"But I don\u0027t see what difference you or I can make,\" Sharmila frowns. \"Were we in your vision, Nadia?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Then why involve us? If Beranabus has searched for this weapon by himself all these years, why come to us for help now.\"\\n\\n \"Because of what I saw and sensed,\" Nadia mumbles. \"If we pursue this, there will be a confrontation. I caught glimpses of a battle with forces greater than our own.\" She pulls her finger away from her mouth. Sets both hands on her knees. Looks at each of us slowly, one after the other, as she speaks. \"Beranabus didn\u0027t tell you about this because there was no time. But I doubt he would have told you anyway, in case he frightened you away.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not frightened of a fight,\" Raz snorts.\\n\\n \"I am,\" Sharmila says. \"But I would fight regardless, if Beranabus asked me. He knows that. I have fought before. Raz too. You said that is why he chose us.\"\\n\\n \"Yes. But it wasn\u0027t just a fight that I sensed.\" Nadia lowers her eyes and looks at the hands on her knees. They\u0027re trembling, but only slightly. She stares at them hard. When they stop trembling, she looks up at us and says directly, without any emotion, \"I also sensed death.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/demon-thief-the-demonata-2/page-8.html","bookId":2176,"book":{"id":2176,"title":"Demon Thief (The Demonata #2)","description":"Storyline: Demon Thief (The Demonata #2) \\n This story is told through the eyes of lonely child Cornelius \"Kernel\" Fleck and takes place probably somewhere in the United Kingdom or Ireland and during the 1970s.
