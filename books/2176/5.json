{"id":99387,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"Two dabs later. The orange light is still pulsing and changing size. Although I can call it closer like the other patches, I can\u0027t send it away more than twenty or twenty-five feet. It\u0027s started to bug me, like an insect which keeps buzzing in front of my face. An uneasiness chews away at me every time I catch sight of it. I know it\u0027s crazy, worrying about a light, but I can\u0027t help myself. I have a bad feeling about this.\n It\u0027s a lovely sunny day. Our teacher, Logan Rile, decided not to waste the weather, so we\u0027re having lessons outside, in one of the fields around Paskinston. There are thirty-four of us, a variety of classes and ages, sitting in a semi-circle around Logan. He\u0027s telling us about tectonic plates. Logan\u0027s not the best teacher. He sometimes forgets he\u0027s talking to children and gets too technical. Very few of us understand everything he says. But he\u0027s interesting, and the bits that make sense are fascinating. It\u0027s also fun when you do understand him - it makes you feel clever.\n Some of the younger children from the cr��che have come with us. Their normal minder has gone to the fair and her replacement\u0027s finding it hard to cope with so many little ones. She was delighted when Logan offered to take a few off her hands for the day.\n Art\u0027s playing with the orange marbles beside me. I shouldn\u0027t let him have them, but he really likes them. Anyway, he hasn\u0027t put them in his mouth yet. I keep a close eye on him, checking every couple of minutes to make sure both marbles are in sight - not in his stomach.\n \"So these plates are moving all the time?\" Bryan Colbert asks. Bryan\u0027s one of the eldest children, nearly seventeen.\n \"Yes,\" Logan says.\n \"Then why don\u0027t countries move?\"\n \"They do,\" Logan says. \"The continents are drifting all the time. It\u0027s very slow, but it\u0027s happening. One day Australia will collide with America or Africa - I can never remember which - and the effects will be catastrophic. New mountains will be thrust upwards. There\u0027ll be tidal waves. Dust will clog the air. Billions of people and animals will die. It might be the end of all life on this planet.\"\n \"All life?\" Dave English - a kid a year younger than me - asks.\n \"Yes.\"\n \"But I didn\u0027t think that could happen. Everybody... everything... can\u0027t just die. Won\u0027t God keep some of us alive?\"\n \"No god can prevent the end of life on this planet,\" Logan says in his usual serious way. \"Or the end of life in this universe. Everything has an end. That\u0027s the way life is. But maybe there\u0027ll be a new beginning when our world ends. New life, new creatures, new means of existence.\"\n \"That\u0027s scary,\" Dave mutters. \"I don\u0027t want everything to die.\"\n \"Nor me,\" Logan smiles. \"But our wants are irrelevant. This is the way things are. We can accept the truth and deal with it, or live in ignorance. Death is nothing to be afraid of. Once you think it through and get it into perspective, it\u0027s not so bad. In fact, many people - \"\n \"Now!\" a woman screams, cutting Logan off. All our heads turn at once, as if our necks were connected. I see Mrs. Egin lumbering up behind us, fingers twitching, frothing at the mouth. \"Now it happens! Up the throat, past the gums, look out world, here it comes!\"\n The pink light which I saw her stroking a few days ago has grown much bigger and now seems to be touching her just behind her head. It\u0027s pulsing quickly. Other patches of light around it are pulsing too, and moving towards it, as though magnetically drawn to it.\n \"Mrs. Egin?\" Logan says, rising, signalling for the rest of us to stay seated. \"Are you all right?\"\n \"They said I couldn\u0027t do it! Thought I wasn\u0027t strong enough to summon them!\" She laughs her witch\u0027s laugh, then sings, \"Wrong! Wrong! Wrong! Now! Now! Now!\"\n \"Mrs. Egin, I think you should - \"\n \"You will see me die!\" she shouts and her eyes scan the group, fixing on me. \"Find the thief! Who\u0027s the thief? Find him!\"\n Fear comes shooting back. I\u0027m not as afraid as when I was alone with her, but I\u0027m pretty petrified. The others are too. We huddle close together, shuffling into a tighter group for protection.\n Logan steps forward. \"Let me take you home, Mrs. Egin. We\u0027ll get you to bed, I\u0027ll call for a doctor, and you\u0027ll be right as rain in - \"\n Mrs. Egin roars a word I don\u0027t know. Her lips are moving fast now, in that strange language she was speaking before. Logan stops short and hesitates. That scares me even more - it\u0027s bad news when your teacher is as frightened as you are.\n The pulsing patches of light are moving faster, drawn towards the pink light. They merge with it, then flow into Mrs. Egin. Now she\u0027s glowing from within, the lights beneath her flesh, spreading through her body.\n I stumble to my feet. \"The lights!\" I gasp.\n Logan looks back at me. \"Calm down, Kernel.\"\n \"But the lights! Can\u0027t you see them?\"\n \"What lights?\"\n \"Inside her! She\u0027s swallowing the lights!\"\n Mrs. Egin cackles while Logan stares at me dumbly. I glance around. Everyone\u0027s looking at me oddly. They can\u0027t see the lights. There\u0027s nothing any of them can do to stop this happening.\n I focus on Mrs. Egin. A bulging, pulsing bubble of light has formed behind and above her, patches melting together, colours mixing, flowing into her. Her eyes are bowls of light. I can\u0027t see her lips - multicoloured froth hides them. Her skin appears to be rippling.\n \"Mrs. Egin,\" Logan tries again, facing her. \"You have to - \"\n The witch shrieks triumphantly. A piercing note of wickedness and victory. I cover my ears with my hands. Logan covers his too. My eyes scrunch shut, but I quickly force them open a crack. I see Mrs. Egin stagger backwards. She goes stiff, arms wide at her sides, head cocked to the left. A gentle, tender smile crosses her lips.\n Then the lights explode through her. And she explodes. Scraps fly everywhere - flesh, bone, guts, blood. Logan and the kids at the front are splattered by the spray. They squeal with disgust and terror. A chunk of bone hits Logan hard in the face and he drops, grunting with pain.\n I cover my eyes and drag Art in close, turning him away from the carnage. I\u0027m screaming. Everybody is. But I can still hear Mrs. Egin\u0027s scream over the sound of all the others, even though she can\u0027t be making any noise now.\n For an uncountable number of seconds the witch\u0027s scream holds, mingling with ours. Then it stops. All the screaming stops in the space of a second or two. Eerie, unnatural silence.\n I don\u0027t want to take my arm away, but I must. I have to look. Others are peeping too, although most are still covering their eyes or looking away from where the witch was standing.\n Mrs. Egin is gone. Nothing of her remains, except a circle of blood and grisly carnage, covering the grass, Logan and many of the children. And at the centre of the circle - a panel of greyness.\n The large grey patch of light hangs motionless a foot or two above the ground. It\u0027s three or four feet wide, maybe six or seven high. Jagged round the edges.\n I\u0027m not the only one who can see this light. Others are pointing at it, gasping, murmuring, \"What the hell is that?\" This is a different type of light from the ones I usually see.\n Logan rises, rubbing his head. Stares in disbelief at the gory mess, then at the grey wall of light. He\u0027s an educated, experienced man. But he\u0027s seen nothing like this before.\n \"She exploded!\" a boy yells, excited. \"Did you see her? It was amazing!\"\n \"Is she dead?\" a girl asks, voice trembling.\n \"What\u0027s that light?\"\n \"Yeah, what is it?\"\n \"Yeah.\"\n Logan walks round the panel of light. I can only see his feet when he\u0027s behind it. Then he comes back into view. He\u0027s more bewildered than afraid, like most of the kids around me. The light has made more of an impression than Mrs. Egin exploding! Perhaps they\u0027re in shock, not ready to deal with the explosion - and her death - yet.\n \"We have to get away from here.\"\n I hadn\u0027t meant to speak, but now that the words have popped out, I know I\u0027m right. Everybody gawps at me. \"This is bad!\" I shout. \"That light\u0027s dangerous. We have to run.\"\n \"It\u0027s OK, Kernel,\" Logan says. \"This is mind-blowing, but we\u0027re in the midst of something wondrous. I\u0027m not sure what\u0027s going on, but this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to experience the miraculous. Mrs. Egin... this light... it\u0027s incredible!\" He beams with delight.\n Some kids get to their feet and drift towards Logan and the panel of grey light. They\u0027re not afraid now that Logan isn\u0027t. They trust him. They think he knows best.\n \"This is wrong!\" I yell. \"It\u0027s evil! Can\u0027t you feel it?\"\n \"You shouldn\u0027t be so suspicious, Kernel,\" Logan laughs uneasily.\n \"You\u0027re covered in blood!\" I roar angrily, unable to believe that someone so smart can be this stupid. \"Mrs. Egin\u0027s dead! You\u0027re walking through her guts!\"\n Logan blinks. Looks down at his blood-soaked shirt and trousers. His red hands. The mess around him. \"Oh,\" he says quietly. \"Oh my - \"\n Something bursts out of the grey light. It has two long legs, a stumpy, leathery body, four arms which end in thick, hairy fingers. A dark green head, a cross between a human\u0027s and a dog\u0027s. No mouth. Long draping ears. Wide, white, evil eyes.\n The thing grabs Logan. It somehow makes a hissing, whistling noise. Logan stares at it in shock. Two of its hands lock on his head. The others clasp his shoulders. The hairs on its fingers extend, growing at an unnatural speed, digging into the flesh of Logan\u0027s face. One hair darts into his right eye, puncturing it. Logan shrieks with pain.\n Then the thing\u0027s upper arms jerk apart quickly - ripping Logan\u0027s head off his neck! The monster tosses it to the ground. Stamps down hard with its right foot. And Logan\u0027s severed head pops like a melon dropped from a great height.\n The thing looks at the rest of us. Spreads its arms and hisses. And thirty-four kids scream as one and crap their pants. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/demon-thief-the-demonata-2/page-5.html","bookId":2176,"book":{"id":2176,"title":"Demon Thief (The Demonata #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Demon Thief (The Demonata #2) \n This story is told through the eyes of lonely child Cornelius \"Kernel\" Fleck and takes place probably somewhere in the United Kingdom or Ireland and during the 1970s.
