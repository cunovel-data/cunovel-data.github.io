{"id":99400,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"Darkness. Silence. I\u0027m crouched over, hands covering my head, trying to protect my face from the sizzling webs. Then I realise I\u0027m not on fire. There\u0027s no pain. I relax my hands and sit up, brushing cobweb ash from my cheeks.\n I can\u0027t see. Total blackness. I reach out with my hands but don\u0027t touch anything. \"Hello?\" I call, then wait for Shark or Dervish to respond.\n No answer.\n I get to my feet, stretch my hands out and start walking. I count steps inside my head. Ten. Fifteen. Twenty. Fifty. A hundred. On my hundred and thirtieth step, my left hand brushes something soft and sticky. I pause and explore with my fingers. It\u0027s a wall of webs. When I try ripping through the webs, they resist.\n \"Dervish!\" I shout. \"Shark!\"\n No answers. No echoes. Only silence.\n Walking, keeping one hand on the webby wall. I come to another wall after several minutes, blocking the way ahead. I turn right and follow the new wall. Only get twelve paces before striking another wall. So I\u0027m either in a very long, narrow room or some sort of alley. Hand on the wall, I start back in the direction I came, trying hard not to panic.\n After sixty-two paces there\u0027s a left turn. A long walk after that, the wall curving slightly. Then I come to the mouth of another room or alley. I head down it, left hand staying in touch with the wall. After twenty-two paces I come to another turning. I start to follow it around to the left then pause. I\u0027ve had an idea.\n Lowering my hand, I shuffle twelve paces across to the right and find the wall opposite. I continue straight ahead, right hand feeling the way. After thirty-six paces I come to a halt. Turn left. Walk ahead. Ten paces... twelve... twenty.\n I stop, smiling ever so slightly. I know where I am now. In a maze.\n A few seconds later, the smile fades - there\u0027s no telling how large this maze is or where the exit might be. Or even if there is an exit. I guess there\u0027s only one way to find out. Keeping a hand on the wall, I start ahead again, further into the pitch-black, demonic maze.\n I\u0027m mapping the maze inside my head. I must have been here for hours. Trying to remember all the twists and turns I\u0027ve taken, the paces between them. Focusing on numbers helps me not worry so much about the darkness, the silence, being all alone with no idea of where...\n The darkness.\n I come to a stunned stop, only now realising why I find the darkness so unsettling. It\u0027s total darkness - there aren\u0027t any patches of light! For the first time in my life I\u0027m experiencing darkness as other people understand it. The lights I\u0027ve grown up with - which I used to create windows between worlds in this universe - have disappeared.\n A terrifying thought strikes like a missile - maybe I\u0027m blind! Perhaps that\u0027s why the darkness is absolute. Maybe Lord Loss burnt my eyes out of their sockets and it\u0027s actually bright as day in here.\n My heart thumps fast. My legs go weak. A life of blackness, lost in a maze, no friends to turn to for help... Maybe that\u0027s what Lord Loss meant when he said I had to find and name the demon thief. Perhaps that\u0027s why he was smirking. He knew that blind, I wouldn\u0027t have any way of identifying Cadaver. He\u0027s tricked me! Robbed me of my sight! Stranded me in this maze of eternal darkness!\n I moan aloud, losing hope, the map of the maze disintegrating inside my head. I should have listened to Beranabus. What made me think I could strike a fair deal with a demon? I feel hysteria bubble up within me. Madness digs its claws into my brain, dragging its way to the surface.\n Magic, a voice inside me whispers. Use magic to create light. Then you\u0027ll find out if you\u0027re blind or not.\n \"I don\u0027t know how to do that,\" I whimper.\n This is a good time to learn, the voice says drily.\n I nod slowly. The voice is right. No point freaking out when my eyes might be perfectly fine. I concentrate, drawing upon the magic. I\u0027m not much good at fighting, but let\u0027s see how I fare in other areas.\n I imagine a ball of light, small, not too bright, like the bulb in my bedroom at home. A simple ball of light - that can\u0027t be too much to ask for.\n But it is. I can\u0027t generate one. Or else I\u0027ve created light, but can\u0027t see it.\n No, the voice says. You\u0027d know if you had done it. There is no light.\n \"So I can\u0027t tell if I\u0027m blind or not. Though I don\u0027t suppose it matters much. If this darkness holds, I might as well be blind.\"\n The voice doesn\u0027t answer immediately. Then, as if speaking to a simpleton, it says, Remember the chess board?\n \"What about it?\"\n It had black squares and white squares. If those squares correspond to the worlds within the Board...\n \"...then half the maze is dark and half is bright!\" I shout.\n Exactly. So all you have to do is find your way to a white square. Then you\u0027ll see again.\n \"Unless I\u0027m in a white square already and I\u0027m blind,\" I quibble.\n Just walk! the voice snaps.\n Stumbling through the maze. I\u0027ve given up trying to keep track of my route. It\u0027s too large to map without a pen and paper (and light). I just have to keep walking and hope that I eventually find my way out by (blind) luck.\n I think about the demon master\u0027s castle and how familiar it seemed. I wonder if I saw it that first time I crossed through a window into the universe of the Demonata. I guess there\u0027s a strong possibility that I did, especially given the fact that I saw Lord Loss beforehand.\n I still can\u0027t remember anything about that trip. I try again to recall what happened when I vanished from my bedroom, where I went, if I came to Lord Loss\u0027 world. But it\u0027s a blank.\n Thinking about that night reminds me of how lonely I was. Without the patches of light I feel lonely again, like before Art came along. I hated being an only child after Annabella died. I think I\u0027ve risked so much for my brother not just because I love him, but because I\u0027m afraid of being alone. He\u0027s the only true friend I\u0027ve ever had.\n For some reason, I find myself thinking about leaving our home in the city. Dad tucking me down in the back seat of the car, handing Art to me, covering us with a blanket, telling me to pretend we had to hide. Mum looking worried. \"Take care of your brother, Kernel. Protect him.\"\n Then my memory cuts to Art playing with the orange marbles in Sally\u0027s house. Holding them up, the marbles twinkling in front of his eyes. I had the sense that he\u0027d been possessed by an evil spirit. That must have been a vision of what was to come. If Art remains with Lord Loss, and the demon master keeps him alive, will he raise him like one of his familiars? Give him evil powers? Bring him up to be monstrous... to kill?\n The marbles are still in my pocket. I pull one out to have something to touch that isn\u0027t a webby wall. I roll it between my fingers, careful not to drop it. It helps calm me down. A pity I can\u0027t see - I could play a game with the marbles if I had some light.\n As I think that, I feel magic seep through my fingers into the marble - and it starts to glow! A soft orange light. I gasp and clutch my fingers tight around it, scared my mind is playing tricks, not wanting to be disappointed.\n Staring down at the space where I imagine my hand to be. Slowly, hesitantly, I allow my fingers to loosen - and light flashes through the cracks! With a burst of relief, I thrust my hand up and let more magic explode into the marble. It flares to life, causing my eyelids to snap shut. I pull back some of the power, then open my lids slowly, not looking directly at the marble.\n I can see! I must have been in a black square of the maze all along, as my inner voice suggested. Not that sight is much of a bonus here. All I see are webby walls and a floor. Several feet above me hangs the ceiling, a mass of black webs, impossible to see through.\n I smile weakly, gazing at the orange marble throwing off the light, feeling more grateful to it than I ever thought possible. I mean, how many people can say their lives have been enriched by a marble!\n Then, because I can\u0027t stand here gazing at the marble all day like it\u0027s some godly artefact, I bring my hand down, hold it slightly ahead of me to light my path, and continue working my way through the seemingly endless maze.\n Not long after. Making my way down a narrow path much like any other, when I hear a sound somewhere ahead and to the left. I pause, listening carefully. Nothing for a few seconds. But then it comes again, a soft ripping noise, then giggling.\n I advance cautiously, dimming the orange light. I think about letting it go out completely, but then not only wouldn\u0027t the person or creature around the corner not be able to see me - I wouldn\u0027t be able to see them.\n I pause at the corner. Listen closely. More ripping sounds. An occasional giggle. I think about calling Dervish or Shark\u0027s name. Dismiss the idea - I never heard Dervish or Shark giggle like that.\n I cup my fingers round the marble, directing the light upwards. Step forward, around the corner.\n It takes my eyes a second to adjust. Then I make out a small shape sitting by the wall to my right, maybe fifteen feet ahead of me. A baby. Pulling at the webs, tearing handfuls out of the wall, eating them. \"Art!\" I shout, letting the light brighten and my fingers drop.\n The baby whirls and of course it isn\u0027t my brother. I knew as soon as the shout left my lips that it wasn\u0027t. It\u0027s the same general size as Art, but green, with lice for hair, fire in its eye sockets and small mouths in the palms of its hands - the first demon I saw when I came to Lord Loss\u0027 world.\n The hell-child spits out a mouthful of webs and hisses at me. I glare at him, hating him for not being Art, for raising my hopes and then dashing them. Not afraid. Despite the fact that I\u0027m not much of a fighter, I\u0027m confident that I can take this demon. He ran once already, which makes me suspect he\u0027s not the bravest of his kind.\n \"Come here,\" I mutter, stepping towards the hell-child, thinking he might know the way out. The demon shows his teeth and takes his own menacing step forward. But then he hesitates, glances around and darts away.\n I grin viciously. I\u0027m through being meek Kernel Fleck, unable to take care of himself. It\u0027s time for payback. With a wild whoop of abandonment, I give chase.\n I race through the maze, hot on the demon\u0027s heels, reckless with excitement. Taking corners without slowing, I bounce off the webby walls more than once, stick for a few seconds, then tear myself free. The hell-child squeals as he runs. That goads me on, makes me eager to catch up with him. The loneliness and uncertainty have vanished. The chase is everything.\n I almost catch the demon a couple of times, when he hits walls and sticks to them. But he pulls free each time and escapes. His back and shoulders are covered in webs. I\u0027m caked with them too, but I don\u0027t stop to wipe them away.\n The demon disappears round a corner to my right. When I turn, I see we\u0027re at the start of an extra long path, and at the end of it... light! Too soon to tell if it\u0027s daylight or the light of a fire. Maybe it\u0027s the glow of some demon. But I race towards it regardless, focusing more on the light than the hell-child now, anxious to leave the darkness behind.\n Almost at the end of the path. I can tell now that the light is coming from overhead and it seems to be widespread. A dull, yellowish light.\n The hell-child darts out of the maze and off to the left, out of sight. I\u0027m at the exit a few seconds later. I pause before stepping out, in case it\u0027s a trap. I let the light of the marble fade, then replace it in my pocket. I flex my fingers - nervous now I\u0027ve stopped - and cautiously nudge out.\n A rocky landscape. There are lots of hills and mounds, and steam spurts out of the ground in many places. The stench of sulphur is thick in the air. In the near distance runs a river of bubbling lava. I know what it is because I\u0027ve been to museums and seen videos of volcanic eruptions. I can\u0027t see the source of the river, but it can\u0027t be far away, since the lava\u0027s red-hot and liquid, flowing swiftly.\n I spot the hell-child running towards the river. I\u0027d like to explore, but I\u0027ve got to maintain my focus and keep up the chase. Perhaps the demon knows where Dervish and Shark are, or Cadaver. Maybe he\u0027s Cadaver in disguise!\n The hell-child reaches the river of lava and stops. Turns and faces me. Squealing louder than ever, head thrown back. I close in on him, ready for him to break left or right, trying to outguess him.\n The demon stops squealing and glares at me. He looks like he plans to attack, but then, surprising me, he takes a step back - on to the river of lava. Steam rises from the demon\u0027s feet, and seconds later they burst into flames. But the hell-child only laughs and blows on them, extinguishing the fire. With a grin at me, he skips across the forty or fifty feet width of the river, jumping off at the other side, only the top of his head visible now.\n I stop at the lava\u0027s edge. The heat is incredible. I feel my skin redden. I use magic to cool it, but even with the help of magic it\u0027s hard to bear. I stare at the lava uncertainly. If the hell-child was able to skip across, I probably can too. But what if I can\u0027t? What if my magic fails me? If I venture out on to the lava, and things take a turn for the worse, I\u0027m finished. This body will rot away and Lord Loss will imprison my soul.\n Trying to work up the courage to test the lava. I look left and right, in case there\u0027s some other way to cross, like a bridge or tunnel - but there\u0027s nothing. The river stretches as far as I can see in both directions.\n As I\u0027m looking around, my eyes flick up to see what the sky is like. But instead of a sky, I find myself gazing at the hideous face of Lord Loss! It\u0027s huge, filling my entire field of vision. He\u0027s laughing, though I can\u0027t hear him. I freeze, horrified by his immense red eyes, the pores and cracks in his skin, which look like moon craters and valleys when magnified to this extent. Then he pulls back and Beranabus replaces him. He\u0027s almost as ugly when seen from this perspective.\n The magician is shouting at me, pointing with a finger the size of a battering ram. It takes me a few seconds to realise he\u0027s gesturing to a spot behind me - trying to warn me! I whirl defensively, but too late. I catch sight of a winged demon with a red, lumpy body, hurtling at me through the air. I duck instantly, but the demon has judged its flight perfectly. It hits me hard in the chest, driving me off my feet, backwards - into the river of molten lava. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/demon-thief-the-demonata-2/page-21.html","bookId":2176,"book":{"id":2176,"title":"Demon Thief (The Demonata #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Demon Thief (The Demonata #2) \n This story is told through the eyes of lonely child Cornelius \"Kernel\" Fleck and takes place probably somewhere in the United Kingdom or Ireland and during the 1970s.
