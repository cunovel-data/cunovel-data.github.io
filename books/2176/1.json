{"id":99383,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"People think I\u0027m crazy because I see lights. I\u0027ve seen them all my life. Strange, multicoloured patches of light swirling through the air. The patches are different sizes, some as small as a coin, others as big as a cereal box. All sorts of shapes - octagons, triangles, decagons. Some have thirty or forty sides. I don\u0027t know the name for a forty-sided shape. Quadradecagon?\n No circles. All of the patches have at least two straight edges. There are a few with curves or semi-circular bulges, but not many.\n Every colour imaginable. Some shine brightly, others glow dully. Occasionally a few of the lights pulse, but normally they just hang there, glowing.\n When I was younger I didn\u0027t know the lights were strange. I thought everybody saw them. I described them to Mum and Dad, but they thought I was playing a game, seeking attention. It was only when I started school and spoke about the lights in class that it became an issue. My teacher, Miss Tyacke, saw that I wasn\u0027t making up stories, that I really believed in the lights.\n Miss Tyacke called Mum in. Suggested they take me to somebody better qualified to understand what the lights signified. But Mum\u0027s never had much time for psychiatrists. She thinks the brain can take care of itself. She asked me to stop mentioning the lights at school, but otherwise she wasn\u0027t concerned.\n So I stopped talking about the lights, but the damage had already been done. Word spread among the children - Kernel Fleck is weird. He\u0027s not like us. Stay away from him.\n I never made many friends after that.\n My name\u0027s Cornelius, but I couldn\u0027t say that when I was younger. The closest I could get was Kernel. Mum and Dad thought that was cute and started using it instead of my real name. It stuck and now that\u0027s what everybody calls me.\n I think some parents shouldn\u0027t be allowed to name their kids. There should be a committee to forbid names which will cause problems later. I mean, even without the lights, what chance did I have of fitting in with any normal crowd with a name like Kernel - or Cornelius - Fleck!\n We live in a city. Mum\u0027s a university lecturer. Dad\u0027s an artist who also does some freelance teaching. (He actually spends more time teaching than drawing, but whenever anyone asks, he says he\u0027s an artist.) We live on the third floor of an old warehouse which has been converted into apartments. Huge rooms with very high ceilings. I sometimes feel like a Munchkin, or Jack in the giant\u0027s castle.\n Dad\u0027s very good with his hands. He makes brilliant model aeroplanes and hangs them from the wooden beams of my bedroom ceiling. When they start to clutter the place up, or if we just get the urge one lazy Sunday afternoon, the pair of us make bombs out of apples, conkers - whatever we can find that\u0027s hard and round - and launch them at the planes. We fire away until we run out of ammo or all the planes are destroyed. Then Dad sets to work on new models and we do it all over again. At the moment the ceiling\u0027s about a third full.\n I like it here. Our apartment is great; we\u0027re close to lots of shops, a cool adventure playground, museums, cinemas galore. School\u0027s OK too. I don\u0027t make friends, but I like my teachers and the building - we have a first-rate lab, a projection room, a massive library. And I never get beaten up - I roar automatically when I\u0027m fighting, which isn\u0027t good news for bullies who don\u0027t want to attract attention!\n But I\u0027m not enjoying life. I\u0027m lonely. I\u0027ve always been a loner, but it didn\u0027t bother me when I was younger. I liked being by myself. I read lots of books and comics, watched dozens of TV shows, invented imaginary friends to play with. I was happy.\n That changed recently. I don\u0027t know why, but I don\u0027t like being alone now. I feel sad when I see groups of friends having a good time. I want to be one of them. I want friends who\u0027ll tell me jokes and laugh at mine, who I can discuss television shows and music with, who\u0027ll pick me to be on their team. I try getting to know people, but the harder I try, the more they avoid me. I sometimes hover at the edge of a group, ignored, and pretend I\u0027m part of it. But if I speak, it backfires. They glare at me suspiciously, move away or tell me to get lost. \"Go watch some lights, freak!\"\n The loneliness got really bad this last month. Nothing interests me any more. The hours drag, especially at home or when I have free time at school. I can\u0027t distract myself. My mind wanders. I keep thinking about friends and how I don\u0027t have any, that I\u0027m alone and might always be. I\u0027ve talked with Mum and Dad about it, but it\u0027s hard to make them understand how miserable I am. They say things will change when I\u0027m older, but I don\u0027t believe them. I\u0027ll still be weird, whatever age I am. Why should people like me more then than now?\n I try so hard to fit in. I watch the popular shows and listen to the bands I hear others raving about. I read all the hot comics and books. Wear trendy clothes when I\u0027m not at school. Swear and use all the cool catchphrases.\n It doesn\u0027t matter. Nothing works. Nobody likes me. I\u0027m wasting my time. This past week, I\u0027ve got to thinking that I\u0027m wasting my entire life. I\u0027ve had dark, horrible thoughts, where I can only see one way out, one way of stopping the pain and loneliness. I know it\u0027s wrong to think that way - life can never be that bad - but it\u0027s hard not to. I cry when I\u0027m alone - once or twice I\u0027ve even cried in class. I\u0027m eating too much food, putting on weight. I\u0027ve stopped washing and my skin\u0027s got greasy. I don\u0027t care. I want to look like the freak I feel I am.\n Late at night. In bed. I\u0027m playing with the patches of light, trying not to think about the loneliness. I\u0027ve always been able to play with the lights. I remember being three or four years old, the lights all around me, reaching out and moving them, trying to fit them together like jigsaw pieces. Normally, the lights remain at a distance of several feet, but I can call them closer when I want to play with them.\n The patches aren\u0027t solid. They\u0027re like floating scraps of plastic. If I look at a patch from the side, it\u0027s almost invisible. I can put my fingers through them, like ordinary pools of light. But, despite that, when I want to move a patch, I can. If I focus on a light, it glides towards me, stopping when I tell it. Reaching out, I push at one of the edges with my fingers. I don\u0027t actually touch it, but as my fingers get closer, the light moves in whatever direction I\u0027m pushing. When I stop, the light stops.\n I figured out very early on that I could put patches together to make patterns. I\u0027ve been doing it ever since, at night, or during lunch at school when I have nobody to play with. Lately, I\u0027ve been playing with them more than ever. Sometimes, the lights are the only way I have to escape the miserable loneliness.\n I like making weird shapes, like Picasso paintings. I saw a programme on him at school a couple of years ago and felt an immediate connection. I think Picasso saw lights too, only he didn\u0027t tell anyone. People wouldn\u0027t have thought he was a great artist if he said he saw lights - they\u0027d have said he was a nutcase, like me.\n The shapes I make are nowhere near as fabulous as Pablo Picasso\u0027s paintings. I\u0027m no artist. I just try to create interesting designs. They\u0027re rough, but I like them. They never last. The shapes hold for as long as I\u0027m studying them, but once I lose interest, or fall asleep, they come undone and the pieces drift apart, returning to their original positions in the air around me.\n The one I\u0027m making tonight is particularly jumbled. I\u0027m finding it hard to concentrate. Joining the pieces randomly, with no real purpose. It\u0027s a mess. I can\u0027t stop thinking about not having any friends. Feeling wretched. Wishing I had at least one true friend, someone who\u0027d care about me and play with me, so I wasn\u0027t completely alone.\n As I\u0027m thinking about that, a few of the patches pulse. No big deal. Lights have pulsed before. Usually, I ignore them. But tonight, sad and desperate to divert my train of thought, I summon a couple, study them with a frown, then put them together and call for the rest of the flashing patches. As I add those pieces to the first two, more lights pulse, some slowly, some quickly.\n I sit up, working with more speed. This new flashing shape is curious. I\u0027ve never put pulsing patches together before. As I add to the cluster, more lights pulse. I quickly slot them into place, working as if on autopilot. I have no control over myself. I keep watching for a pattern to emerge, but there isn\u0027t one. Just a mass of different pulsing colours. Still, it\u0027s worked its magic. I\u0027m focused on the cluster of lights now, dark thoughts and fears temporarily forgotten.\n The lights build and build. This is a massive structure, much larger than any I\u0027ve previously created. I\u0027m sweating and my arms are aching. I want to stop and rest, but I can\u0027t. I\u0027m obsessed with the pulsing lights. This must be what addiction is like.\n Then, without warning, the patches that I\u0027ve stuck together stop pulsing and all glow a light blue colour. I fall back, gasping, as if I\u0027d got an electric shock. I\u0027ve never seen this happen. It scares me. A huge blue, jagged patch of light at the foot of my bed. It\u0027s like a window. Large enough for a person to fit through.\n My first thought is to flee, call for Mum and Dad, get out as quick as I can. But part of me holds firm. An inner voice whispers in my ear, telling me to stay. This is your window to a life of wonders, it says. But be careful, it adds, as I move closer to the light. Windows open both ways.\n As it says that, a shape presses through, out of the panel of light. A face. I\u0027m too horrified to scream. It\u0027s a monster from my very worst nightmare. Pale red skin. A pair of dark red eyes. No nose. A small mouth. Sharp, grey teeth. As it leans further forward into my bedroom, I see more of it and the horror intensifies. It doesn\u0027t have a heart! There\u0027s a hole in the left side of its chest, but where the heart should be are dozens of tiny, hissing snakes.\n The monster frowns and stretches a hand towards me. I can see more than two arms - at least four or five. I want to pull away. Dive beneath my bed. Scream for help. But the voice that spoke to me a few seconds ago won\u0027t let me. It whispers quickly, words I can\u0027t follow. And I find myself standing firm, taking a step towards the panel of light and its emerging monster. I raise my right hand and watch the fingers curl into a fist. I can feel a strange tingling sensation, like pins and needles.\n The monster stops. Its eyes narrow. It looks round my bedroom uncertainly. Then slowly, smoothly, it withdraws, pulling back into the panel of light, vanishing gradually until only its red eyes remain, staring out at me from within the surrounding blueness, twin circles of an unspoken evil. Then they\u0027re gone too and I\u0027m alone again, just me and the light.\n I should be wailing for help, running for my life, cowering on the floor. But instead my fingers relax and my fist unclenches. I\u0027m facing the panel of blue light, staring at it like a zombie transfixed by a fresh human brain, distantly processing information. Normally, the patches of light are transparent, but I can\u0027t see through this one. If I look round it, there\u0027s my bedroom wall, a chest of drawers, toys and socks scattered across the floor. But when I look directly at the light, all I see is blue.\n The voice says something crazy to me. I know it\u0027s madness as soon as it speaks. I want to argue, roar at it, tell it to get stuffed. But, as scared and confused as I am, I can\u0027t disobey. I find my legs tensing. I know, with sick certainty, what\u0027s going to happen next. I open my mouth to scream, to try and stop it, but before I can, a force makes me step forward - after the monster, into the light. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/demon-thief-the-demonata-2/page-1.html","bookId":2176,"book":{"id":2176,"title":"Demon Thief (The Demonata #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Demon Thief (The Demonata #2) \n This story is told through the eyes of lonely child Cornelius \"Kernel\" Fleck and takes place probably somewhere in the United Kingdom or Ireland and during the 1970s.
