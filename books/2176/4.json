{"id":99386,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"I lie to Mum. Tell her Art peed on me. She\u0027s surprised - he\u0027s never been a wetter. She wants to change him. I tell her it\u0027s all right, I\u0027ll take care of it. I hurry to my bedroom and change my trousers. I\u0027m almost out the door before I remember that Art should be changed too, so I quickly find clean clothes for him.\n I consider telling Mum about Mrs. Egin\u0027s behaviour. Recall her threat - \"slit your throat from your left ear to your right.\" Don\u0027t say a word.\n The day passes uncomfortably. I can\u0027t forget what Mrs. Egin said, her wicked expression, stroking the pulsing patch of light. \"You will see me die.\"\n I should tell someone. It doesn\u0027t matter that she threatened me. She won\u0027t be able to sneak into my room if I tell someone and they lock her up like the mad old witch she is.\n But I wet my trousers. If I tell about the rest, I\u0027ll have to tell about that too. And I don\u0027t want people knowing. So I say nothing. I pretend it didn\u0027t happen, that it doesn\u0027t matter. And all day long I feel as if a thousand eels of terror are wriggling around inside me.\n Dad\u0027s talking with Mum about a craft fair when I come home. She\u0027s listening quietly, sitting by the piano. (It was in the house when we moved in - none of us can play.) She\u0027s frowning.\n \"This is one of the biggest fairs in the country,\" Dad says. \"It\u0027s held every year, and a few of the Paskinston artists always go, representing the village. They sell a lot of work at it and rack up loads of orders. It\u0027s a real honour to be asked. It would be rude to refuse.\"\n \"But can\u0027t one of us go and one stay here?\" Mum asks.\n \"Yes, but couples normally go together. It\u0027s not just about selling. There are hundreds of artists and interesting people there. It\u0027s a chance to meet, mingle, get to know other people. It\u0027ll be fun.\"\n I hand Art to Mum and sit close to her, following the conversation. I learn a bit more about the fair, where it\u0027s held, who\u0027s going, how long they\u0027ll be gone for. Dad\u0027s proud to have been invited and keen to go, but Mum\u0027s worried about Art and me. She doesn\u0027t want to leave us alone. \"Can\u0027t we take them along?\" she asks.\n \"It\u0027s not the done thing,\" Dad says patiently. \"Nobody else brings their kids.\"\n Mum\u0027s frown deepens. We haven\u0027t been apart since we left the city, not for a single night. But if they go to the fair, they\u0027ll be gone for at least a week.\n \"They won\u0027t be by themselves,\" Dad says. \"We\u0027ll leave them with one of the neighbours.\"\n \"I know, but...\"\n \"Kernel doesn\u0027t mind. Do you, Kernel?\" He smiles broadly at me, expecting my support. If this was yesterday, I\u0027d have given it instantly. But Mrs. Egin\u0027s threat is fresh in my thoughts. I don\u0027t want to be left alone. So I just shrug in answer. \"You OK, big guy?\" Dad asks, surprised.\n \"Yeah.\"\n \"If you don\u0027t want us to go, just say. It\u0027s not that important.\"\n \"No. I mean, I don\u0027t mind. Not really. It\u0027s just...\" I can\u0027t explain without telling them the truth. So again I shrug.\n \"What about Art?\" Mum says, kissing his head, looking up at Dad.\n \"Art will be fine too,\" Dad says and he sounds a little impatient now.\n \"I\u0027m not sure, Caspian.\"\n \"Melena...\" Dad sighs. \"Look, if it\u0027s going to be a big deal, we won\u0027t go. But this is our home now. We\u0027re safe here. I don\u0027t think we\u0027ve anything to fear in this place. Do you?\"\n \"No,\" Mum says quietly.\n \"So...?\"\n Mum pulls a face. \"I just don\u0027t like being apart from my darling babies!\" she exclaims. We all laugh at that, and everything\u0027s fine again. Mum bounces Art up and down on her knee. Dad smiles and hugs her. I feel happy and safe. I ask what\u0027s for dinner, and forget about the witch and all the bad thoughts of the day.\n The morning of their departure. Dad gets the car ready while Mum takes Art and me over to Sally\u0027s house. Sally is one of the villagers who lives alone. A bit older than Mum. Fat. A great singer. She has two children of her own, but they\u0027ve grown up and left.\n \"We\u0027re going to have a great time,\" Sally says as we set our bags down in the room where Art and I are staying.\n \"I wish there was a phone, so we could call and check that everything is all right,\" Mum grumbles. There aren\u0027t many phones in the village and Sally doesn\u0027t own one.\n \"Relax!\" Sally laughs. \"These boys can get along fine without you for a few days. Can\u0027t you, Kernel?\"\n \"Sure,\" I smile. Mum smiles back, but shakily.\n Dad calls us and we head out. He\u0027s standing by the car. The back seat and boot are filled with musical instruments and paintings. Two other couples have already left in a caravan with the majority of the pieces which they hope to sell. Dad hugs Art, then me.\n \"Look after your brother,\" Mum says, kissing my cheek.\n \"Of course he will,\" Dad says. \"Kernel\u0027s the best brother in the world. He\u0027ll take care of Art better than you or I could.\"\n Dad gets in and starts the engine. Mum hugs us one last time, then sits in beside him. And they\u0027re off. Art, Sally and I wave after them. Mum rolls down her window, leans out and waves back, until they turn a corner. Although Sally\u0027s right beside us, I can\u0027t help but think as they roll out of sight - we\u0027re alone now. Just Art and me. In a remote village. With a witch.\n The day passes smoothly. School, playing with Art during lunch, dinner with Sally and some others. The villagers like to share meals. Here it\u0027s not polite to eat by yourself all the time. We often have guests over to eat with us, or go to a neighbour\u0027s house.\n Art doesn\u0027t miss Mum and Dad. He eats, drinks, plays and behaves the same as always. Doesn\u0027t cry when Sally gives him a bath. He does give her a sharp nip on her left forearm at one stage, leaving deep marks, but that\u0027s normal for Art.\n \"We should stitch his lips together when he\u0027s not eating,\" Sally says, rubbing her arm. But she\u0027s only joking. Sally loves kids. Of course, she\u0027d rather not be bitten, but the whole village knows about Art\u0027s biting habits. Sally knew what she was letting herself in for when she offered to have us.\n It\u0027s strange not having Mum and Dad around. Things were different when we lived in the city. They often went out at night, leaving me with a babysitter. And they\u0027d go for holidays by themselves occasionally. I didn\u0027t mind. I enjoyed staying with other people - I always got loads of treats.\n But for the last year we\u0027ve been together all the time. I\u0027ve got used to them being at home every night. I feel like I did when I lost my favourite teddy bear a few years ago. It was a scruffy grey bear, nothing special, but I\u0027d had it since I was a baby. It had been my constant companion, even when I\u0027d outgrown my other teddies. I took it to bed, on holiday, even to the cinema. I felt like a friend had died when I lost it.\n This is almost the same. Not as bad because I know Mum and Dad will come back. But strange. Like something\u0027s wrong with the world.\n I\u0027m uneasy when it\u0027s time for bed. Sally\u0027s spare bed is soft, but it smells damp, like my socks when they\u0027re wet. Art goes to sleep immediately, delighted to be sharing a bed with me. But I can\u0027t drop off. I\u0027m tired - I woke early, knowing Mum and Dad were leaving - but my eyelids won\u0027t stay closed.\n I think about Mrs. Egin. I haven\u0027t seen her since that morning when she witched out on me. I\u0027ve taken the long way to school and back every day since. I\u0027ve tried to laugh it off, make like it was no big deal. Told myself I imagined the curses and her stroking the patch of light.\n But I know what I saw. I can\u0027t pretend it didn\u0027t happen. And although I\u0027m not as scared as I was that first night, I\u0027m still shaken, afraid to close my eyes in case she\u0027s there when I open them, standing over me, cackling, a knife to my throat.\n I turn from my left side to my right, then back again. I try lying flat on my back, then on my stomach. Nothing works.\n Annoyed, I stop trying to sleep, hoping I\u0027ll drift off by accident. I look round the small, cosy room, then focus on the patches of light. They look the same as ever, various shapes and shades. I count triangles, quadrangles, pentagons, sextants... No, that\u0027s an instrument. Sextuplet? I\u0027m not sure. I think that\u0027s right, but I\u0027m not... maybe it\u0027s a...\n I wake suddenly. Hexagon! Of course. Can\u0027t believe I had trouble remembering that. The brain can play funny tricks when you\u0027re tired. I turn, yawning, looking for Art.\n He isn\u0027t there.\n At first, I think he\u0027s just slipped further down beneath the covers, but when I lift them there\u0027s no sign of him.\n I sit up swiftly, sensing danger, recalling Mum\u0027s last words to me - \"Look after your brother.\" Flash on an image of Mrs. Egin sneaking in, stealing Art, putting him in a big black pot and boiling him alive.\n My world is never truly dark. The patches of light mean I can see pretty well even on the blackest night. Mum and Dad used to try to convince me that the lights weren\u0027t real, but if they\u0027re imaginary, why do I have such fantastic night vision?\n I get out of bed and hurry to the door, so certain Art isn\u0027t in the room that my gaze glides right over him and I almost crash into him. Then my senses click in and I stop. Blink a couple of times to properly clear my eyes.\n Art\u0027s in the middle of the room. There\u0027s a large patch of orange light pulsing just over his head. He\u0027s playing with marbles which Sally gave to me earlier. He\u0027s holding two of them up over his eyes. They\u0027re orange-coloured, like the light.\n Art sees me and smiles, looking at me through the orange marbles. For a brief second I\u0027m positive that somebody or something is in the room with us. I think I hear a soft growling noise. My head snaps left, then right - nothing. I look back at Art. In the strange orange light, with the marbles covering his eyes, he doesn\u0027t look like my brother. I start to think that it\u0027s not Art, that he\u0027s been replaced by some evil spirit, that the witch has been here. I feel afraid. I back up to the bed.\n \"Art?\" I say, very softly. \"Is that you? Are you OK?\"\n A giggle breaks the spell. Art lowers the marbles. And I see that of course it\u0027s him.\n \"Idiot!\" I laugh weakly at myself. I go pick Art up and take the marbles away. Sally said not to let him have them in case he swallowed one. Art grumbles and tries to grab them back, but I tell him they\u0027re dangerous. He understands that and snuggles into me, nuzzling my shoulder with his teeth, but gently, not like when he bites somebody.\n I stand there with Art, feeling cold but happy, smiling at how silly I was. Art falls asleep in my arms. I carry him back to bed, tuck him in, then climb in beside him. Lying on my side, I stare at the orange light, still pulsing. It seems to have grown bigger, but that\u0027s not unusual - the patches often change size.\n I don\u0027t like this orange light. There\u0027s something creepy about it. It reminds me of the pink light which Mrs. Egin stroked. I turn my back on it and shut my eyes tight, trying to fall asleep again. But I can still sense it there, hanging in the cold night air, lighting up the room with its ominous orange glow. Pulsing. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/demon-thief-the-demonata-2/page-4.html","bookId":2176,"book":{"id":2176,"title":"Demon Thief (The Demonata #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Demon Thief (The Demonata #2) \n This story is told through the eyes of lonely child Cornelius \"Kernel\" Fleck and takes place probably somewhere in the United Kingdom or Ireland and during the 1970s.
