He\u0027s my cousin\u0027s brother-in-law. He\u0027ll be fine. He\u0027s been begging for a chance to go out with us.\"\\n\\n \"I have a bad feeling,\" Jaime said.\\n\\n They had arrived in Seville early that afternoon, and had examined half a dozen banks before choosing their target. It was on a side street, small, not too much traffic, close to a factory that would be making deposits there. Everything seemed perfect. Except for the man in the getaway car.\\n\\n \"Is he all that\u0027s worrying you?\" Felix asked.\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"What, then?\"\\n\\n It was a difficult one to answer. \"Call it a premonition.\" He tried to say it lightly, mocking himself.\\n\\n Felix took it seriously. \"Do you want to call it off?\"\\n\\n \"Because I have the nerves of an old washerwoman today? No, amigo. It will all go as smooth as silk.\"\\n\\n In the beginning, it did.\\n\\n There were half a dozen patrons in the bank, and Felix held them at bay with an automatic weapon while Jaime cleared out the cash drawers. Smooth as silk.\\n\\n As the two men were leaving, heading for the getaway car, Jaime called out, \"Remember, amigos, the money is for a good cause.\"\\n\\n It was out in the street that it began to fall apart. There were police everywhere. The driver of the getaway car was on his knees on the pavement, a police pistol at his head.\\n\\n As Jaime and Felix came into view, a detective called out, \"Drop your weapons.\"\\n\\n Jaime hesitated for one split second. Then he raised his gun. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-sands-of-time/page-41.html","bookId":2361,"book":{"id":2361,"title":"The Sands of Time","description":"Storyline: Four nuns find themselves suddenly thrust into a hostile world they long ago abandoned for the safety of the convent. nwittingly they become pawns in a battle between the charismatic Jaime Miró, leader of the outlawed Basque nationalists, and the ruthless Colonel Ramón Acoca of the Spanish Amy. \\n Four women - and the men they are forbidden to love. \\n Megan - the orphan, who feels an overpowering attraction to Jaime. \\n Lucia - the fiery Sicilian beauty on the run for murder - and Rubio Arzano, the freedom fighter who risks his life to save her. \\n Teresa - whose guilty conscience finally drives her to betray her friends. \\n Graciela - who bears a terrible secret thet almost destroys her - and the courageous Ricardo who loves her.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-sands-of-time.jpg","author":"Sidney Sheldon","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-sands-of-time.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:39 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:08:20 AM"}}
