And it\u0027s not over yet, Megan thought.\n She was on her way to California to sign the papers that would give Scott Industries one million acres of timberland north of San Francisco. She had struck a hard bargain.\n It\u0027s their fault, Megan thought. They shouldn\u0027t have tried to cheat me. I\u0027ll bet I\u0027m the first bookkeeper they\u0027ve ever come up against from a Cistercian convent She laughed aloud.\n The steward approached her. \"Can I get you anything, Miss Scott?\"\n She saw a stack of newspapers and magazines in the rack. She had been so busy with the deal that she had not had time to read anything. \"Let me see The New York Times, please.\"\n The story was on the front page and it leaped out at her. There was a photograph of Jaime Miro. Below it the article read: \"Jaime Miro, leader of ETA, the radical Basque separatist movement in Spain, was wounded and captured by police during a bank holdup yesterday afternoon in Seville. Killed in the attack was Felix Carpio, another of the alleged terrorists. The authorities had been conducting a search for Miro since...\"\n Megan read the rest of the article and sat there for a long time, frozen, remembering the past. It was like a distant dream photographed through a gauze curtain, hazy and unreal.\n This fight will be over soon. We\u0027ll get what we want because the people are behind us...I would like you to wait for me...\n Long ago she had read of a civilization that believed if you saved a person\u0027s life, you were responsible for him. Well, she had saved Jaime twice - once at the castle, and again at the park. I\u0027ll be damned if I\u0027m going to let them kill him now.\n She reached for the telephone next to her seat and said to the pilot, \"Turn the plane around. We\u0027re going back to New York.\"\n A limousine was waiting for her at La Ouardia Airport, and by the time she arrived in her office it was two A.M. Lawrence Gray, Jr., was waiting for her. His father had been the company\u0027s attorney for years and had retired. His son was bright and ambitious.\n Without preamble, Megan said, \"Jaime Miro. What do you know about him?\"\n The reply was immediate. \"He\u0027s a Basque terrorist, head of ETA. I think I just read that he was captured a day or so ago.\"\n \"Right. The government is going to have to put him on trial. I want to have someone there. Who\u0027s the best trial lawyer in the country?\"\n \"I\u0027d say Curtis Hayman.\"\n \"No. Too much of a gentleman. We need a killer.\" She thought for a moment. \"Get Mike Rosen.\"\n \"He\u0027s booked for the next hundred years, Megan.\"\n \"Unbook him. I want him in Madrid for the trial.\"\n He frowned. \"We can\u0027t get involved in a public trial in Spain.\"\n \"Sure we can. Amicus curiae. We\u0027re friends of the defendant.\"\n He studied her a moment. \"Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?\"\n \"Yes. Get on this.\"\n \"I\u0027ll do my best.\"\n \"Larry...\"\n \"Yes?\"\n \"And then some.\" There was steel in her voice.\n Twenty minutes later, Lawrence Gray, Jr., walked back into Megan\u0027s office. \"Mike Rosen is on the phone. I think I woke him up. He wants to talk to you.\"\n Megan picked up the telephone. \"Mr. Rosen? What a pleasure this is. We\u0027ve never met, but I have a feeling you and I are going to become very good friends. A lot of people sue Scott Industries just for the target practice, and I\u0027ve been looking around for someone to take charge of all our litigation. Yours is the one name that keeps coming up. Naturally, I\u0027m prepared to pay you a large retainer for - \"\n \"Miss Scott - ?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"I don\u0027t mind a little snow job, but you\u0027re giving me frostbite.\"\n \"I don\u0027t understand.\"\n \"Then let me put it in legal parlance for you. Cut out the bullshit. It\u0027s two o\u0027clock in the morning. You don\u0027t hire people at two o\u0027clock in the morning.\"\n \"Mr. Rosen - \"\n \"Mike. We\u0027re going to be good friends, remember? But friends have to trust one another. Larry tells me you want me to go to Spain to try to save some Basque terrorist who\u0027s in the hands of the police.\"\n She started to say, \"He\u0027s not a terrorist - \" but stopped herself. \"Yes.\"\n \"What\u0027s your problem? Is he suing Scott Industries because his gun jammed?\"\n \"He - \"\n \"I\u0027m sorry, friend. I can\u0027t help you. My schedule is so tight that I gave up going to the bathroom six months ago. I can recommend a few lawyers...\"\n No, Megan thought. Jaime Miro needs you. And she was suddenly seized by a sense of hopelessness. Spain was another world, another time. When she spoke, her voice sounded weary. \"Never mind,\" she said. \"It\u0027s a very personal matter. I\u0027m sorry for coming on so strongly.\"\n \"Hey! That\u0027s what CEOs are supposed to do. Very personal is different, Megan. To tell you the truth, I\u0027m dying to hear what interest the head of Scott Industries has in saving a Spanish terrorist. Are you free for lunch tomorrow?\"\n She was going to let nothing stand in her way. \"Absolutely.\"\n \"Le Cirque at one o\u0027clock?\"\n Megan felt her spirits lifting. \"Fine.\"\n \"You make the reservation. But I have to warn you about something.\"\n \"Yes?\"\n \"I have a very nosy wife.\"\n They met at Le Cirque, and when Sirio had seated them, Mike Rosen said, \"You\u0027re better-looking than your picture. I\u0027ll bet everybody tells you that.\"\n He was very short, and he dressed carelessly. But there was nothing careless about his mind. His eyes radiated a blazing intelligence.\n \"You\u0027ve aroused my curiosity,\" Mike Rosen said. \"What\u0027s your interest in Jaime Miro?\"\n There was so much to tell. Too much to tell. All Megan said was, \"He\u0027s a friend. I don\u0027t want him to die.\"\n Rosen leaned forward in his seat. \"I went through the newspaper files on him this morning. If Don Juan Carlos\u0027s government executes Miro only once, he\u0027ll be way ahead of the game. They\u0027re going to get hoarse just reading the charges against your friend.\" He saw the expression on Megan\u0027s face. \"I\u0027m sorry, but I have to be honest. Miro has been a very busy man. He holds up banks, blows up cars, murders people - \"\n \"He\u0027s not a murderer. He\u0027s a patriot. He\u0027s fighting for his rights.\"\n \"Okay, okay. He\u0027s my hero too. What do you want me to do?\"\n \"Save him.\"\n \"Megan, we\u0027re such good friends that I\u0027m going to tell you the absolute truth. Jesus Christ himself couldn\u0027t save him. You\u0027re looking for a miracle that - \"\n \"I believe in miracles. Will you help me?\"\n He studied her a moment. \"What the hell. What are friends for? Have you tried the pate? I hear they make it kosher.\"\n The Fax message from Madrid read: \"Have spoken to half a dozen top European lawyers. They refuse to represent Miro. Tried to have myself admitted to trial as amicus curiae. Court ruled against me. Wish I could pull off that miracle for you, friend, but Jesus hasn\u0027t risen yet. Am on my way home. You owe me a lunch. Mike.\"\n The trial was set to begin the seventeenth of September.\n \"Cancel my appointments,\" Megan told her assistant. \"I have some business to take care of in Madrid.\"\n \"How long will you be gone?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know.\"\n Megan planned her strategy on the plane flying over the Atlantic. There has to be a way, she thought. I have money and I have power. The prime minister is the key. I have to get to him before the trial starts. After that, it will be too late.\n Megan had an appointment with Prime Minister Leopoldo Martinez twenty-four hours after she arrived in Madrid. He invited her to Moncloa Palace for lunch.\n \"Thank you for seeing me so promptly,\" Megan said. \"I know what a busy man you are.\"\n He raised a hand in deprecation. \"My dear Miss Scott, when the head of an organization as important as Scott Industries flies to my country to see me, I can only be honored. Please tell me how I can assist you.\"\n \"I really came here to assist you,\" Megan said. \"It occurred to me that while we have a few factories in Spain, we\u0027re not using nearly enough of the potential that your country has to offer.\"\n He was listening closely now, his eyes shining. \"Yes?\"\n \"Scott Industries is thinking about opening a huge electronics plant. It should employ somewhere between a thousand and fifteen hundred people. If it is as successful as we think it will be, we\u0027ll open satellite factories.\"\n \"And you have not decided in which country you wish to open this plant?\"\n \"That\u0027s right. I\u0027m personally in favor of Spain, but quite frankly, Your Excellency, some of my executives are not too happy with your civil rights record.\"\n \"Really?\"\n \"Yes. They feel that those who object to some of the policies of the state are treated too harshly.\"\n \"Do you have anyone in particular in mind?\"\n \"As a matter of fact, I do. Jaime Miro.\"\n He sat there staring at her. \"I see. And if we were to be lenient with Jaime Miro, we would get the electronics factory and - \"\n \"And a lot more,\" Megan assured him. \"Our factories will raise the standard of living in every community they\u0027re in.\"\n The prime minister frowned. \"I\u0027m afraid there is one small problem.\"\n \"What? We can negotiate further.\"\n \"This is something that cannot be negotiated, Miss Scott. Spain\u0027s honor is not for sale. You cannot bribe us or buy us or threaten us.\"\n \"Believe me, I\u0027m not - \"\n \"You come here with your handouts and expect us to run our courts to please you? Think again, Miss Scott. We don\u0027t need your factories.\"\n I\u0027ve made it worse, Megan thought, despairingly.\n The trial lasted six weeks in a heavily guarded courtroom that was closed to the public.\n Megan remained in Madrid, following the news reports of the trial each day. From time to time, Mike Rosen telephoned her.\n \"I know what you\u0027re going through, friend. I think you should come home.\"\n \"I can\u0027t, Mike.\"\n She tried to see Jaime.\n \"Absolutely no visitors.\"\n The last day of the trial, Megan stood outside the courtroom, lost in a crowd of people. Reporters came streaming out of the building, and Megan stopped one of them.\n \"What happened?\"\n \"They found him guilty on all counts. He\u0027s going to get the garrote.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-sands-of-time/page-42.html","bookId":2361,"book":{"id":2361,"title":"The Sands of Time","description":"Storyline: \n Four nuns find themselves suddenly thrust into a hostile world they long ago abandoned for the safety of the convent. nwittingly they become pawns in a battle between the charismatic Jaime Miró, leader of the outlawed Basque nationalists, and the ruthless Colonel Ramón Acoca of the Spanish Amy. \n Four women - and the men they are forbidden to love. \n Megan - the orphan, who feels an overpowering attraction to Jaime. \n Lucia - the fiery Sicilian beauty on the run for murder - and Rubio Arzano, the freedom fighter who risks his life to save her. \n Teresa - whose guilty conscience finally drives her to betray her friends. \n Graciela - who bears a terrible secret thet almost destroys her - and the courageous Ricardo who loves her.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-sands-of-time.jpg","author":"Sidney Sheldon","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-sands-of-time.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:39 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:08:20 AM"}}
