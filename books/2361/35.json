{"id":68312,"no":35,"title":"Page 35","content":"Early the following morning, they reached the outskirts of Nanclares, a small village west of Vitoria. They came to a filling station with a garage, where a mechanic was working on a car. Jaime pulled into the garage. \"Buenas dias,\" the mechanic said. \"What is the problem?\" \"If I knew,\" Jaime replied, \"I would fix it myself and charge for it. This car is as useless as a mule. It sputters like an old woman and has no energy.\" \"It sounds like my wife,\" the mechanic grinned. \"I think you may have a carburetor problem, senor.\" Jaime shrugged. \"I know nothing about cars. All I know is that I have a very important appointment in Madrid tomorrow. Can you have it fixed by this afternoon?\" The mechanic said, \"I have two jobs ahead of you, senor, but - \" He let the rest of the sentence hang in the air. \"I will be glad to pay you double.\" The mechanic\u0027s face brightened. \"Will two o\u0027clock be all right?\" \"Wonderful. We\u0027ll get something to eat and come back at two.\" Jaime turned to the others, who had been listening to the conversation in amazement. \"We\u0027re in luck,\" Jaime said. \"This man is going to fix the car for us. Let\u0027s go eat.\" They got out of the car and followed Jaime down the street. \"Two o\u0027clock,\" the mechanic said. \"Two o\u0027clock.\" When they were out of earshot, Felix said, \"What are you doing? There\u0027s nothing wrong with the car.\" Except that by now the police will be looking for it, Megan thought. But they\u0027ll be looking on the road, not in a garage. It\u0027s a clever way to get rid of it \"By two o\u0027clock we\u0027ll be gone, won\u0027t we?\" Megan asked. Jaime looked at her and grinned. \"I have to make a phone call. Wait here.\" Amparo took Jaime\u0027s arm. \"I\u0027ll go with you.\" Megan and Felix watched them walk off. Felix looked at Megan and said, \"You and Jaime are getting along well, yes?\" \"Yes.\" She suddenly felt shy. \"He is not an easy man to know. But he is a man of great honor and great bravery. He is a very caring man. There is no one like him. Did I tell you how he saved my life, Sister?\" \"No. I would like to hear.\" \"A few months ago the government executed six freedom fighters. In revenge, Jaime decided to blow up the dam at Puente la Reina, south of Pamplona. The town below was headquarters for the army. We moved in at night, but someone tipped off the GOE, and Acoca\u0027s men caught three of us. We were sentenced to die. It would have taken an army to storm our prison, but Jaime figured out a way. He set the bulls loose in Pamplona, and in the confusion got two of us away. The third one was beaten to death by Acoca\u0027s men. Yes, Sister, Jaime Miro is very special.\" When Jaime and Amparo returned, Felix asked, \"What is happening?\" \"Friends are picking us up. We\u0027ll have a ride into Vitoria.\" Half an hour later, a truck appeared. The back of it was covered by canvas. \"Welcome,\" the driver said cheerfully. \"Hop in.\" \"Thank you, amigo.\" \"It\u0027s a pleasure to be of assistance to you, senor. It\u0027s good that you called. The damned soldiers are swarming around like fleas. It is not safe for you and your friends to be out in the open.\" They climbed into the back of the truck, and the huge vehicle headed northeast. \"Where will you be staying?\" the driver asked. \"With friends,\" Jaime said. And Megan thought: He doesn\u0027t trust anyone. Not even someone who is helping him. But how can he? His life is in danger. And she thought of how terrible it must be for Jaime to be living under that shadow, running from the police and the army. And all because he believed in an ideal so much that he was willing to die for it. What was it he had said? The difference between a patriot and a rebel depends on who is in power at the moment The ride was a pleasant one. The thin canvas cover offered security, and Megan realized how much fear she had felt when they were out in the open fields, knowing that they were all being hunted. And Jaime lives with that tension constantly. How strong he is. She and Jaime talked, and the conversation flowed easily, as though they had known each other forever. Amparo Jiron sat listening to them, saying nothing, her face impassive. \"When I was a boy,\" Jaime told Megan, \"I wanted to be an astronomer.\" Megan was curious. \"What made you - ?\" \"I had seen my mother and father and sisters shot down, and friends murdered, and I couldn\u0027t face what was happening here on this bloody earth. The stars were an escape. They were millions of light years away, and I used to dream of going to them one day and getting away from this awful planet.\" She was watching him, silent. \"But there is no escape, is there? In the end, we all have to face up to our responsibilities. So I came back down to earth. I used to believe that one person could not make a difference. But I know now that that is not true. Jesus made a difference, and Mohammed and Gandhi and Einstein and Churchill.\" He smiled wryly. \"Don\u0027t misunderstand, Sister. I\u0027m not comparing myself to any of them. But in my small way, I do what I can. I think we must all do what we can.\" And Megan wondered whether his words were meant to have a special meaning for her. \"When I got the stars out of my eyes, I studied to be an engineer. I learned to build buildings. Now I blow them up. And the irony is that some of the buildings I\u0027ve blown up are ones that I\u0027ve built.\" They reached Vitoria at dusk. \"Where shall I take you?\" the truck driver asked. \"You can drop us off here, at the corner, amigo.\" The truck driver nodded. \"Right. Keep up the good fight.\" Jaime helped Megan down from the truck. Amparo watched, her eyes blazing. She allowed her man to touch no other woman. She\u0027s a whore, Amparo thought. And Jaime is homy for that bitch of a nun. Well, that won\u0027t last. He will soon find that her milk is thin. He needs a real woman. The group took to the side streets, keeping a wary eye out for trouble. Twenty minutes later, they arrived at a one-story stone house nestled in a narrow street and surrounded by a high fence. \"This is it,\" Jaime said. \"We will stay here tonight and leave tomorrow when it is dark.\" They entered through the front gate and went to the door. It took Jaime but a moment to slip the lock, and they all went inside. \"Whose house is this?\" Megan asked. \"You ask too many questions,\" Amparo said. \"Just be grateful we\u0027ve kept you alive.\" Jaime looked at Amparo a moment. \"She\u0027s proved her right to ask questions.\" He turned to Megan. \"It\u0027s the house of a friend. You\u0027re in Basque country now. From here on our journey will be easier. There will be comrades everywhere, watching and protecting us. You\u0027ll be at the convent the day after tomorrow.\" And Megan felt a small chill that was almost a sorrow. What is the matter with me? she wondered. Of course I want to go back. Forgive me, Lord. I asked that You bring me home to Your safety, and You are. \"I\u0027m starved,\" Felix said. \"Let\u0027s check out the kitchen.\" It was completely stocked. Jaime said, \"He left plenty of food for us. I will make us a wonderful dinner.\" He smiled at Megan. \"I think we deserve it, don\u0027t you?\" Megan said, \"I didn\u0027t know men cooked.\" Felix laughed. \"Basque men take pride in their cooking. You are in for a treat. You will see.\" Handing Jaime the ingredients he asked for, they watched as he prepared a piperade of fresh roasted green peppers, sliced white onions, tomatoes, eggs, and ham sauteed together. As it started to cook, Megan said, \"It smells delicious.\" \"Ah, that\u0027s just the appetizer. I\u0027m going to make a famous Basque dish for you - pollo al chilindron.\" He didn\u0027t say \"for us,\" Amparo noted. He said, \"for you.\" For the bitch. Jaime cut chicken into strips, sprinkled salt and pepper over them, and browned them in hot oil while in a separate pan he started to cook onions, garlic, and tomatoes. \"We\u0027ll let it simmer for half an hour.\" Felix had found a bottle of red wine. He passed out glasses. \"The red wine of La Rioja. You will like this.\" He offered a glass to Megan. \"Sister?\" The last time Megan had tasted wine had been at communion. \"Thank you,\" she said. Slowly she raised the glass to her lips and took a sip. It was delicious. She took another sip and she could feel a warmth moving down her body. It felt wonderful. I must enjoy all this while I can, Megan thought. It will be over soon. During dinner, Jaime seemed unusually preoccupied. \"What\u0027s troubling you, amigo?\" Felix asked. Jaime hesitated. \"We have a traitor in the movement.\" There was a shocked silence. \"What - what makes you think that?\" Felix demanded. \"Acoca. He keeps getting too close to us.\" Felix shrugged. \"He\u0027s the fox and we\u0027re the rabbits.\" \"It\u0027s something more than that.\" \"What do you mean?\" Amparo asked. \"When we were going to blow up the dam at Puente la Reina, Acoca was tipped off.\" He looked at Felix. \"He set a trap and caught you and Ricardo and Zamora. If I hadn\u0027t been delayed, I would have been captured with you. And look what happened at the parador.\" \"You heard the clerk telephoning the police,\" Amparo pointed out. Jaime nodded. \"Right. Because I had a feeling that something was wrong.\" Amparo\u0027s face was somber. \"Who do you think it is?\" Jaime shook his head. \"I\u0027m not sure. Someone who knows all our plans.\" \"Then let\u0027s change our plans,\" Amparo said. \"We\u0027ll meet the others at Logrono and skip Mendavia.\" Jaime glanced at Megan. \"We can\u0027t do that. We have to get the sisters to their convent.\" Megan looked at him and thought: He\u0027s already done enough for me. I mustn\u0027t put him in greater danger than he\u0027s already in. \"Jaime, I can - \" But he knew what she was going to say. \"Don\u0027t worry, Megan. We\u0027re all going to get there safely.\" He\u0027s changed, Amparo thought. In the beginning he wanted nothing to do with any of them. Now he\u0027s willing to risk his life for her. And he calls her Megan. It\u0027s no longer Sister. Jaime was going on. \"There are at least fifteen people who know our plans.\" \"We have to find out which one it is,\" Amparo insisted. \"How do we do that?\" Felix asked. He was nervously picking at the edges of the tablecloth. Jaime said, \"Paco is in Madrid doing some checking for me. I\u0027ve arranged for him to telephone me here.\" He looked at Felix for a moment, then looked away. What he had not said was that no more than half a dozen people knew the exact route that the three groups were taking. It was true that Felix Carpio had been imprisoned by Acoca. It was also true that that would have provided a perfect alibi for Felix. At the propitious moment, an escape could have been planned for him. Except that I got him out first, Jaime thought. Paco is checking on him. I hope he calls soon. Amparo rose and turned to Megan. \"Help me with the dishes.\" The two women began to clear the table and the men went into the living room. \"The nun - she\u0027s holding up well,\" Felix said. \"Yes.\" \"You like her, don\u0027t you?\" Jaime found it difficult to look at Felix. \"Yes. I like her.\" And you would betray her along with the rest of us. \"What about you and Amparo?\" \"We\u0027re cut from the same cloth. She believes in the cause as much as I do. Her entire family was killed by Franco\u0027s Falangists.\" Jaime rose and stretched. \"Time to turn in.\" \"I don\u0027t think I\u0027m going to be able to sleep tonight. Are you certain there\u0027s a spy?\" Jaime looked at him and said, \"I\u0027m certain.\" When Jaime came downstairs for breakfast in the morning, Megan did not recognize him. His face had been darkened, he was wearing a wig and a moustache, and he was dressed in scruffy clothes. He looked ten years older. \"Good morning,\" he said. His voice coming out of that body startled her. \"Where did you - ?\" \"This is a house I use from time to time. I keep an assortment of things here that I need.\" He said it casually, but it gave Megan a sudden insight into the kind of life he led. How many other houses and disguises did he need to stay alive? How many other close calls had he had that she knew nothing about? She remembered the ruthlessness of the men who had attacked the convent and thought: If they catch Jaime, they\u0027ll show him no mercy. I wish I knew how to protect him. Megan\u0027s mind was filled with thoughts she had no right to be thinking. Amparo prepared breakfast: bacalao - steamed, salted codfish - goat\u0027s milk, cheese, and thick, hot chocolate with churros. As they were eating, Felix asked, \"How long are we going to stay here?\" Jaime replied casually, \"We\u0027ll leave when it gets dark.\" But he had no intention of letting Felix use that information. \"I have some errands to do,\" he told Felix. \"I\u0027ll need your help.\" \"Right.\" Jaime called Amparo aside. \"When Paco calls, tell him I\u0027ll be back shortly. Take a message.\" She nodded. \"Be careful.\" \"Don\u0027t worry.\" He turned to Megan. \"Your last day. Tomorrow you\u0027ll be at the convent. You must be eager to get there.\" She looked at him a long moment. \"Yes.\" Not eager, Megan thought. Anxious. I wish I weren\u0027t anxious. I\u0027m going to shut myself away from this, but for the rest of my life I\u0027m going to wonder what happened to Jaime and Felix and the others. Megan stood there watching as Jaime and Felix left. She sensed a tension between the two men that she did not understand. Amparo was studying her, and Megan remembered her words: Jaime is much too much man for you. Amparo said curtly, \"Make up the beds. I\u0027ll prepare lunch.\" \"All right.\" Megan went toward the bedrooms. Amparo stood there watching her, then walked into the kitchen. For the next hour, Megan worked, busily concentrating on cleaning and dusting and polishing, trying not to think, trying to keep her mind off what was bothering her. I must put him out of my mind, she thought. It was impossible. He was like a force of nature, taking over everything in his path. She polished harder. When Jaime and Felix returned, Amparo was waiting for them at the door. Felix looked pale. \"I\u0027m not feeling too well. I think I\u0027ll lie down for a bit.\" They watched him disappear into a bedroom. \"Paco called,\" Amparo said excitedly. \"What did he say?\" \"He has some information for you, but he didn\u0027t want to discuss it on the phone. He\u0027s sending someone to meet you. This person will be at the village square at noon.\" Jaime frowned, thoughtful. \"He didn\u0027t say who it is?\" \"No. Just that it was urgent.\" \"Damn it. I - never mind. All right. I\u0027ll go meet him. I want you to keep an eye on Felix.\" She looked at him, puzzled. \"I don\u0027t un - ?\" \"I don\u0027t want him using the telephone.\" A flash of understanding crossed her face. \"You think that Felix is - ?\" \"Please. Just do as I ask.\" He looked at his watch. \"It\u0027s almost noon. I\u0027ll leave now. I should be back in an hour. Take care, querida.\" \"Don\u0027t worry.\" Megan heard their voices. I don\u0027t want him using the telephone. You think that Felix is - ? Please. Just do as I ask. So Felix is the traitor, Megan thought. She had seen him go into his bedroom and close the door. She heard Jaime leave. Megan walked into the living room. Amparo turned. \"Have you finished?\" \"Not quite. I - \" She wanted to ask where Jaime had gone, what they were going to do with Felix, what was going to happen next, but she did not want to discuss that with this woman. I\u0027ll wait until Jaime returns. \"Finish up,\" Amparo said. Megan turned and went back into the bedroom. She thought about Felix. He had seemed so friendly, so warm. He had asked her many questions, but now that seeming act of friendliness took on a different meaning. The bearded man was looking for information that he could pass on to Colonel Acoca. All their lives were in danger. Amparo may need help, Megan thought. She started toward the living room, then stopped. A voice was saying, \"Jaime just left. He will be alone on a bench in the main plaza. He\u0027s disguised in a wig and mustache. Your men should have no trouble picking him up.\" Megan stood there, frozen. \"He\u0027s walking, so it should take him about fifteen minutes to get there.\" Megan listened with growing horror. \"Remember our deal, Colonel,\" Amparo said into the telephone. \"You promised not to kill him.\" Megan backed into the hallway. Her mind was in a turmoil. So Amparo was the traitor. And she had sent Jaime into a trap. Backing away quietly so Amparo would not hear her, Megan turned and ran out the back door. She had no idea how she was going to help Jaime. She knew only that she had to do something. She stepped outside the gate and started down the street, moving as fast as she could without attracting attention, heading toward the center of the city. Please, God. Let me be on time, Megan prayed. The walk to the village square was a pleasant one, with side streets shaded by towering trees, but Jaime was unaware of his surroundings. He was thinking about Felix. He had been like a brother to him, had given him his full trust. What had turned him into a traitor willing to put all their lives in jeopardy? Perhaps Paco\u0027s messenger would have the answer. Why couldn\u0027t Paco have discussed it on the telephone? Jaime wondered. He was approaching the village square. In the middle of the plaza was a fountain and shade trees with benches scattered around. Children were playing tag. A couple of old men were playing boule. Half a dozen men were seated on the benches, enjoying the sunshine, reading, dozing, or feeding the pigeons. Jaime crossed the street, slowly moving along the path, and took a seat on one of the benches. He looked at his watch just as the tower clock began to chime noon. Paco\u0027s man should be coming. Out of the corner of his eye, Jaime saw a police car pull up at the far end of the square. He looked in the other direction. A second police car arrived. Officers were getting out, moving toward the park. His heart began to beat faster. It was a trap. But who had set it? Was it Paco, who sent the message, or Amparo, who delivered it? She had sent him to the park. But why? Why? There was no time to worry about that now. He had to escape. But Jaime knew that the moment he tried to make a run for it, they would shoot him down. He could try to bluff it out, but they knew he was there. Think of something. Fasti A block away, Megan was hurrying toward the park. As it came into view, she took in the scene at a glance. She saw Jaime seated on a bench, and the policemen closing in on the park from both sides. Megan\u0027s mind was racing. There was no way for Jaime to escape. She was walking past a grocer\u0027s shop. Ahead of her, blocking her path, a woman was pushing a baby carriage. The woman stopped, set the carriage against the wall of the store, and went inside to make a purchase. Without a moment\u0027s hesitation, Megan grabbed the handle of the baby carriage and moved across the street into the park. The police were walking along the benches now, questioning the men seated there. Megan elbowed her way past a policeman and went up to Jaime, pushing the baby carriage ahead of her. She yelled, \"Madre de Dios! There you are, Manuel! I\u0027ve been looking everywhere for you. I\u0027ve had enough! You promised to paint the house this morning, and here you are sitting in the park like some millionaire. Mother was right. You\u0027re a good-for-nothing bum. I never should have married you in the first place!\" It took Jaime less than a fraction of a second. He got to his feet. \"Your mother is an expert on bums. She married one. If she - \" \"Who are you to talk? If not for my mother, our baby would starve to death. You certainly don\u0027t bring any bread into the house...\" The policemen had stopped, taking in the argument. \"If that one was my wife,\" one of them muttered, \"I\u0027d send her back to her mother.\" \"I\u0027m damned tired of your nagging, woman,\" Jaime roared. \"I\u0027ve warned you before. When we get home, I\u0027m going to teach you a lesson.\" \"Good for him,\" one of the policemen said. Jaime and Megan noisily quarreled their way out of the park, pushing the baby carriage before them. The policemen turned their attention back to the men seated on the benches. \"Identification, please?\" \"What\u0027s the problem, Officer?\" \"Never mind. Just show me your papers.\" All over the park, men were pulling out wallets and extracting bits of paper to prove who they were. In the midst of this, a baby began to cry. One of the policemen looked up. The baby carriage had been abandoned at the corner. The quarreling couple had vanished. Thirty minutes later, Megan walked through the front door of the house. Amparo was nervously pacing up and down. \"Where have you been?\" Amparo demanded. \"You shouldn\u0027t have left the house without telling me.\" \"I had to go out to take care of something.\" \"What?\" Amparo asked suspiciously. \"You don\u0027t know anyone here. If you - \" Jaime walked in, and the blood drained from Amparo\u0027s face. But she quickly regained her composure. \"What - what happened?\" she asked. \"Didn\u0027t you go to the park?\" Jaime said quietly, \"Why, Amparo?\" And she looked into his eyes and knew it was over. \"What made you change?\" She shook her head. \"I haven\u0027t changed. You have. I\u0027ve lost everyone I loved in this stupid war you\u0027re fighting. I\u0027m sick of all the bloodshed. Can you stand hearing the truth about yourself, Jaime? You\u0027re as bad as the government you\u0027re fighting. Worse, because they\u0027re willing to make peace, and you\u0027re not. You think you\u0027re helping our country? You\u0027re destroying it. You rob banks and blow up cars and murder innocent people, and you think you\u0027re a hero. I loved you, and I believed in you once, but - \" Her voice broke. \"This bloodshed has to end.\" Jaime walked up to her, and his eyes were ice. \"I should kill you.\" \"No,\" Megan gasped. \"Please! You can\u0027t.\" Felix had come into the room and was listening to the conversation. \"Jesus Christ! So she\u0027s the one. What do we do with the bitch?\" Jaime said, \"We\u0027ll have to take her with us and keep an eye on her.\" He took Amparo by the shoulders and said softly, \"If you try one more trick, I promise you you\u0027ll die.\" He shoved her away and turned to Megan and Felix. \"Let\u0027s get out of here before her friends arrive.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-sands-of-time/page-35.html","bookId":2361,"book":{"id":2361,"title":"The Sands of Time","description":"Storyline: Four nuns find themselves suddenly thrust into a hostile world they long ago abandoned for the safety of the convent. nwittingly they become pawns in a battle between the charismatic Jaime Miró, leader of the outlawed Basque nationalists, and the ruthless Colonel Ramón Acoca of the Spanish Amy.
