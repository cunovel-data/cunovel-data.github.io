{"id":68299,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"Jaime Miro came awake instantly, aroused by a movement at the edge of the clearing. He slipped out of the sleeping bag and rose, gun in hand. As he drew nearer he saw Megan on her knees, praying. He stood there, studying her. There was an unearthly beauty about the image of this lovely woman praying in the forest in the middle of the night, and Jaime found himself resenting it. If Felix Carpio hadn\u0027t blurted out that we were headed for San Sebastian, I wouldn\u0027t have been burdened with the sister in the first place.\n It was imperative that he get to San Sebastian as quickly as possible. Colonel Acoca and his men were all around them, and it would have been difficult enough slipping through their net alone. With the added burden of this woman to slow him down, the danger was increased tenfold.\n He walked over to Megan, angry, and his voice was harsher than he had intended.\n \"I told you to get some sleep. I don\u0027t want you slowing us down tomorrow.\"\n Megan looked up and said quietly, \"I\u0027m sorry if I\u0027ve angered you.\"\n \"Sister, I save my anger for more important things. Your kind just bore me. You spend your lives hiding behind stone walls waiting for a free trip to the next world. You make me sick to my stomach, all of you.\"\n \"Because we believe in the next world?\"\n \"No, Sister. Because you don\u0027t believe in this one. You ran away from it.\"\n \"To pray for you. We spend our lives praying for you.\"\n \"And you think that will solve the problems of the world?\"\n \"In time, yes.\"\n \"There is no time. Your God can\u0027t hear your prayers because of the noise of the cannons and the screams of children being torn apart by bombs.\"\n \"When you have faith - \"\n \"Oh, I have lots of faith, Sister. I have faith in what I\u0027m fighting for. I have faith in my men, and in my guns. What I don\u0027t have faith in are people who walk on water. If you think your God is listening now, tell him to get us to the convent at Mendavia so I can be rid of you.\"\n He was angry with himself for losing his temper. It wasn\u0027t her fault that the Church had stood idly by while Franco\u0027s Falangists had tortured and raped and murdered Basques and Catalans. It wasn\u0027t her fault, Jaime told himself, that my family was among the victims.\n Jaime had been a young boy then, but it was a memory that would be etched forever in his brain...\n He had been awakened in the middle of the night by the noise of the bombs falling. They fell from the sky like deadly flowers of sound, planting their seeds of destruction everywhere.\n \"Get up, Jaime. Hurry!\"\n The fear in his father\u0027s voice was more frightening to the boy than the terrible roar of the aerial bombardment.\n Guernica was a stronghold of the Basques and General Franco had decided to make it an object lesson: \"Destroy it.\"\n The dreaded Nazi Condor Legion and half a dozen Italian planes had mounted a concentrated attack, and they showed no mercy. The townspeople tried to flee from the rain of death pouring down from the skies, but there was no escape.\n Jaime, his mother and father, and two older sisters fled with the others.\n \"To the church,\" Jaime\u0027s father said. \"They won\u0027t bomb the church.\"\n He was right. Everyone knew that the church was on the side of the Caudillo, turning a blind eye to the savage treatment of his enemies.\n The Miro family headed for the church, fighting their way through the panicky crowds, trying to flee.\n The young boy held his father\u0027s hand in a fierce grip and tried not to hear the terrible noises around him. He remembered a time when his father was not frightened, was not running away.\n \"Are we going to have a war, Papa? he had once asked his father.\n \"No, Jaime. That\u0027s just newspaper talk. All we\u0027re asking is that the government give us a reasonable amount of independence. The Basques and the Catalans are entitled to have their own language and flag and holidays. We\u0027re still one nation. And Spaniards will never fight against Spaniards.\"\n Jaime was too young then to understand it, but of course there was more at stake than the issue of the Catalans and Basques. It was a deep ideological conflict between the Republican government and the right-wing Nationalists, and what had started out as a spark of dissension quickly became an uncontrollable conflagration that drew in a dozen foreign powers.\n When Franco\u0027s superior forces had defeated the Republicans and the Nationalists were firmly in control of Spain, Franco turned his attention to the intransigent Basques: \"Punish them.\"\n And the blood continued to flow.\n A hard core of Basque leaders had formed ETA, a movement for a Basque Free State, and Jaime\u0027s father was asked to join.\n \"No. It is wrong. We must gain what is rightfully ours by peaceful means. War accomplishes nothing.\"\n But the hawks proved stronger than the doves, and ETA quickly became a powerful force.\n Jaime had friends whose fathers were members of ETA, and he listened to the stories of their heroic exploits.\n \"My father and a group of his friends bombed the headquarters of the Guardia Civil,\" a friend would tell him.\n Or: \"Did you hear about the bank robbery in Barcelona? My father did that. Now they can buy weapons to fight the Fascists.\"\n And Jaime\u0027s father was saying, \"Violence is wrong. We must negotiate.\"\n \"We blew up one of their factories in Madrid. Why isn\u0027t your father on our side? Is he a coward?\"\n \"Don\u0027t listen to your friends, Jaime,\" his father told him. \"What they are doing is criminal.\"\n \"Franco ordered a dozen Basques executed without even a trial. We\u0027re staging a nationwide strike. Is your father going to join us?\"\n \"Papa - ?\"\n \"We are all Spaniards, Jaime. We must not let anyone divide us.\"\n And the boy was torn. Are my friends right? Is my father a coward? Jaime believed his father.\n And now - Armageddon. The world was collapsing around him. The streets of Guernica were crowded with a screaming mob trying to escape from the falling bombs. All around them buildings and statues and sidewalks were exploding in showers of concrete and blood.\n Jaime and his mother and father and sisters had reached the large church, the only building in the square still standing. A dozen people were pounding on the door.\n \"Let us in! In the name of Jesus, open up!\"\n \"What\u0027s going on?\" cried Jaime\u0027s father.\n \"The priests have locked the church. They won\u0027t let us in.\"\n \"Let\u0027s break the door in!\"\n \"No!\"\n Jaime looked at his father in surprise.\n \"We don\u0027t break into God\u0027s house,\" his father said. \"He will protect us wherever we are.\"\n Too late, they saw the squad of Falangists appear from around the corner and open machine-gun fire on them, mowing down the unarmed crowd of men, women, and children in the square. Even as Jaime\u0027s father felt the bullets tear into him, he grabbed his son and pushed him down to safety, his own body shielding Jaime from the deadly hail of bullets.\n An eerie silence seemed to blanket the world after the attack. The sounds of guns and running feet and screams vanished, a trick of magic. Jaime opened his eyes and lay there for a long time, feeling the weight of his father\u0027s body on him like a loving blanket. His father and mother and sisters were dead, along with hundreds of others. And in front of their bodies were the locked doors of the church.\n Late that night, Jaime made his way out of the city, and two days later when he reached Bilbao, he joined ETA.\n The recruiting officer had looked at him and said, \"You\u0027re too young to join, son. You should be in school.\"\n \"You\u0027re going to be my school,\" Jaime Miro said quietly. \"You\u0027re going to teach me how to fight to avenge the murder of my family.\"\n He never looked back. He was battling for himself and for his family, and his exploits became legendary. Jaime planned and executed daring raids against factories and banks, and carried out the executions of the oppressors. When any of his men were captured, he conducted daredevil missions to rescue them.\n When Jaime heard about the GOE being formed to pursue Basques, he smiled and said, \"Good. They\u0027ve noticed.\"\n He never asked himself if the risks he took had anything to do with the cries of \"Your father is a coward,\" or if he was trying to prove anything to himself and to others. It was enough that he proved his bravery again and again, that he was not afraid to risk his life for what he believed in.\n Now, because one of his men had talked too freely, Jaime found himself saddled with a nun.\n It\u0027s ironic that her Church is on our side now. But it\u0027s much too late, unless they can arrange a Second Coming and include my mother and father and sisters, he thought bitterly.\n They walked through the woods at night, the white moonlight dappling the forest around them. They avoided the towns and main roads, alert for any sign of danger. Jaime ignored Megan. He walked with Felix, talking about past adventures, and Megan found herself intrigued. She had never known anyone like Jaime Miro. He was filled with such self-assurance.\n If anyone can get me to Mendavia, Megan thought, this man can.\n There had been moments when Jaime had felt pity for the sister, and even a reluctant admiration for the way she handled herself on the arduous journey. He wondered how the other men were getting along with their charges from God.\n At least he had Amparo Jiron. At night Jaime found her a great comfort.\n She\u0027s as dedicated as I am, Jaime thought. She has even more reason than I do to hate the government\n Amparo\u0027s entire family had been wiped out by the Nationalist Army. She was fiercely independent, and filled with a deep passion.\n At dawn they were nearing Salamanca, on the banks of the Tonnes River.\n \"Students come here from all over Spain,\" Felix explained to Megan, \"to attend the university. It\u0027s probably the best in all of Spain.\"\n Jaime was not listening. He was concentrating on his next move. If I were the hunter, where would I set my trap?\n He turned to Felix. \"We\u0027ll skip Salamanca. There\u0027s a parador just outside town. We will stop there.\"\n The parador was a small inn set away from the mainstream of tourist traffic. Stone steps led to the lobby, which was guarded by an ancient knight in armor.\n As the group approached the entrance, Jaime said to the two women, \"Wait here.\" He nodded to Felix Carpio and the two men disappeared.\n \"Where are they going?\" Megan asked.\n Amparo Jiron gave her a contemptuous look. \"Maybe they went looking for your God.\"\n \"I hope they find Him,\" Megan said evenly.\n Ten minutes later the men were back.\n \"All clear,\" Jaime told Amparo. \"You and the sister will share a room. Felix will stay with me.\" He handed her a key.\n Amparo said petulantly, \"Querido, I want to stay with you, not - \"\n \"Do as I say. Keep an eye on her.\"\n Amparo turned to Megan. \"Bueno. Come along, Sister.\"\n Megan followed Amparo into the parador and up the stairs.\n The room was one of a dozen set in a row along the gray, bare upstairs corridor. Amparo unlocked the door and the two women entered. The room was small and drab and sparsely furnished, with wooden floors, stucco walls, a bed, a small cot, a battered dressing table, and two chairs.\n Megan looked around the room and exclaimed, \"It\u0027s lovely.\"\n Amparo Jiron swung around in anger, thinking that Megan was being sarcastic. \"Who the hell are you to complain about - ?\"\n \"It\u0027s so large,\" Megan went on.\n Amparo looked at her a moment, then laughed. Of course it would seem large compared to the cells that the sisters lived in.\n Amparo started to get undressed.\n Megan could not help staring at her. It was the first time she had really looked at Amparo Jiron in the daylight. The woman was beautiful, in an earthy way. She had red hair, white skin, and was fullbreasted, with a small waist and hips that swayed as she moved.\n Amparo saw her watching. \"Sister - would you tell me something? Why would anyone join a convent?\"\n It was a simple question to answer. \"What could be more wonderful than to devote oneself to the glory of God?\"\n \"Offhand, I could think of a thousand things.\" Amparo walked over to the bed and sat down. \"You can sleep on the cot. From what I\u0027ve heard about convents, your God doesn\u0027t want you to be too comfortable.\"\n Megan smiled. \"It doesn\u0027t matter. I\u0027m comfortable inside.\"\n In their room across the corridor, Jaime Miro was stretching out on the bed. Felix Carpio was trying to get settled on the small cot. Both men were fully dressed. Jaime\u0027s gun was under his pillow. Felix\u0027s gun was on the small, battered table next to him.\n \"What do you think makes them do it?\" Felix wondered aloud. \"Do what, amigo?\"\n \"Lock themselves up in a convent all their lives like prisoners.\"\n Jaime Miro shrugged. \"Ask the sister. I wish to hell we were traveling alone. I have a bad feeling about this.\"\n \"Jaime, God will thank us for this good deed.\"\n \"Do you really believe that? Don\u0027t make me laugh.\"\n Felix did not pursue the subject. It was not tactful to discuss the Catholic Church with Jaime. The two men were silent, each preoccupied with his own thoughts.\n Felix Carpio was thinking: God put the sisters in our hands. We must get them to a convent safely.\n Jaime was thinking about Amparo. He wanted her badly now. That damned nun. He started to pull up the covers when he realized there was something he still had to do.\n In the small, dark lobby downstairs, the room clerk sat quietly, waiting until he was sure that the new guests were asleep. His heart was pounding as he picked up the telephone and dialed a number.\n A lazy voice answered, \"Police headquarters.\"\n The clerk whispered into the telephone to his nephew, \"Florian, I have Jaime Miro and three of his people here. How would you like the honor of capturing them?\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-sands-of-time/page-22.html","bookId":2361,"book":{"id":2361,"title":"The Sands of Time","description":"Storyline: \n Four nuns find themselves suddenly thrust into a hostile world they long ago abandoned for the safety of the convent. nwittingly they become pawns in a battle between the charismatic Jaime Miró, leader of the outlawed Basque nationalists, and the ruthless Colonel Ramón Acoca of the Spanish Amy. \n Four women - and the men they are forbidden to love. \n Megan - the orphan, who feels an overpowering attraction to Jaime. \n Lucia - the fiery Sicilian beauty on the run for murder - and Rubio Arzano, the freedom fighter who risks his life to save her. \n Teresa - whose guilty conscience finally drives her to betray her friends. \n Graciela - who bears a terrible secret thet almost destroys her - and the courageous Ricardo who loves her.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-sands-of-time.jpg","author":"Sidney Sheldon","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-sands-of-time.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:39 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:08:20 AM"}}
