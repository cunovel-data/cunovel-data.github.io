He was furious at the delay.\\n\\n \"Why wasn\u0027t I informed immediately?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry, Colonel, but it never occurred to us that - \"\\n\\n \"You had him in your hands and you let him get away!\"\\n\\n \"It wasn\u0027t our - \"\\n\\n \"Send in the bank teller.\"\\n\\n The teller was filled with a sense of self-importance. \"It was my window he came to. I could tell he was a killer by the look in his eye. He - \"\\n\\n \"There is no doubt in your mind that the man who held you up was Jaime Miro?\"\\n\\n \"None. He even showed me a wanted poster of himself. It was - \"\\n\\n \"Did he come into the bank alone?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. He pointed to a woman in the line and he said she was a member of his gang, but after Miro left I recognized her. She\u0027s a secretary who\u0027s a regular customer and - \"\\n\\n Colonel Acoca said impatiently, \"When Miro left, did you see in which direction he went?\"\\n\\n \"Out the front door.\"\\n\\n The interview with the traffic policeman was no more helpful.\\n\\n \"There were four of them in the car, Colonel. Jaime Miro and another man and two women in the back.\"\\n\\n \"In what direction were they headed?\"\\n\\n The policeman hesitated. \"They could have gone in any direction, sir, once they got off the one-way street.\" His face brightened. \"I can describe the car, though.\"\\n\\n Colonel Acoca shook his head in disgust. \"Don\u0027t bother.\"\\n\\n She was dreaming, and in her dream there were the voices of a mob, and they were coming for her to burn her at the stake for robbing a bank. It wasn\u0027t for me. It was for the cause. The voices grew louder.\\n\\n Megan opened her eyes and sat up, staring at the unfamiliar castle walls. The sound of voices was real. It was coming from outside.\\n\\n Megan rose and hurried over to the narrow window. Directly below, in front of the castle, was an encampment of soldiers. She was filled with a sudden panic. They\u0027ve caught us. I have to find Jaime.\\n\\n She hurried to the room where he and Amparo had slept and looked inside. It was empty. She ran down the steps to the reception hall on the main floor. Jaime and Amparo were standing near the bolted front door, whispering.\\n\\n Felix ran up to them. \"I checked the back. There\u0027s no other way out of here.\"\\n\\n \"What about the back windows?\"\\n\\n \"Too small. The only way out is through the front door.\"\\n\\n Where the soldiers are, Megan thought. We\u0027re trapped.\\n\\n Jaime was saying, \"It\u0027s just our damned bad luck that they picked this place to camp.\"\\n\\n \"What are we going to do?\" Amparo whispered.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s nothing we can do. We\u0027ll have to stay here until they leave. If - \"\\n\\n And at that moment there was a loud knock at the front door. An authoritative voice called out, \"Open up in there.\"\\n\\n Jaime and Felix exchanged a quick look, and without a word drew their guns.\\n\\n The voice called out again, \"We know there\u0027s someone in there. Open up.\"\\n\\n Jaime said to Amparo and Megan, \"Get out of the way.\"\\n\\n It\u0027s hopeless, Megan thought as Amparo moved behind Jaime and Felix. There must be two dozen armed soldiers out there. We haven\u0027t got a chance.\\n\\n Before the others could stop her, Megan moved swiftly to the front door and opened it.\\n\\n \"Thank the Lord you\u0027ve come!\" Megan exclaimed. \"You must help me.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-sands-of-time/page-33.html","bookId":2361,"book":{"id":2361,"title":"The Sands of Time","description":"Storyline: Four nuns find themselves suddenly thrust into a hostile world they long ago abandoned for the safety of the convent. nwittingly they become pawns in a battle between the charismatic Jaime Miró, leader of the outlawed Basque nationalists, and the ruthless Colonel Ramón Acoca of the Spanish Amy. \\n Four women - and the men they are forbidden to love. \\n Megan - the orphan, who feels an overpowering attraction to Jaime. \\n Lucia - the fiery Sicilian beauty on the run for murder - and Rubio Arzano, the freedom fighter who risks his life to save her. \\n Teresa - whose guilty conscience finally drives her to betray her friends. \\n Graciela - who bears a terrible secret thet almost destroys her - and the courageous Ricardo who loves her.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-sands-of-time.jpg","author":"Sidney Sheldon","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-sands-of-time.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:39 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:08:20 AM"}}
