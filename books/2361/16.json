{"id":68293,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"New York City\n 1976\n The reporters gathered outside the gray fa\u0026ccedil;ade of New York\u0027s Waldorf-Astoria Hotel watched the parade of celebrities in evening dress alight from their limousines, enter the revolving doors, and head for the Grand Ballroom on the third floor. The guests had come from around the world.\n Cameras flashed as reporters called out, \"Mr. Vice-President, would you look this way, please?\"\n \"Governor Adams, could I have one more picture, please?\"\n There were senators and representatives from several foreign countries, business tycoons, and celebrities. And they were all there to celebrate Ellen Scott\u0027s sixtieth birthday. In truth, it was not so much Ellen Scott that they were honoring as the philanthropy of Scott Industries, one of the most powerful conglomerates in the world. The huge, sprawling empire included oil companies and steel mills, communications systems and banks. All the money raised this evening would go to international charities.\n Scott Industries had interests in every part of the world. Twenty-seven years earlier, its president, Milo Scott, had died unexpectedly of a heart attack, and his wife, Ellen, had taken over the management of the huge conglomerate. In the ensuing years she proved to be a brilliant executive, more than tripling the assets of the company.\n The Grand Ballroom of the Waldorf-Astoria was an enormous room decorated in beige and gold, with a red-carpeted stage at one end. A balcony holding thirty-three boxes with a chandelier over each one curved around the entire room.\n In the center of the balcony sat the guest of honor. There were at least six hundred men and women present, dining at tables gleaming with silver.\n When dinner was finished, the governor of New York strode onto the stage.\n \"Mr. Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, honored guests, we are all here tonight for one purpose: to pay tribute to a remarkable woman and to her unselfish generosity over the years. Ellen Scott is the kind of person who could have made a success in any field. She would have been a great scientist or doctor. She would also have made a great politician, and I must tell you that if Ellen Scott decides to run for president of the United States, I\u0027ll be the first one to vote for her. Not in the next election, of course, but the one after that.\"\n There was laughter and applause.\n \"But Ellen Scott is much more than just a brilliant woman. She is a charitable, compassionate human being who never hesitates to get involved in the problems that face the world today...\"\n The speech went on for ten more minutes, but Ellen Scott was no longer listening. How wrong he is, she thought wryly. How wrong they all are. Scott Industries isn\u0027t even my company. Milo and I stole it And I\u0027m guilty of a far greater crime than that It doesn\u0027t matter any longer. Not now. Because I\u0027ll be dead soon.\n She remembered the doctor\u0027s exact words as he read the lab report that was her death sentence.\n \"I\u0027m dreadfully sorry, Mrs. Scott, but I\u0027m afraid there\u0027s no way to break this to you gently. The cancer has spread throughout your lymphatic system. It\u0027s inoperable.\"\n She had felt the sudden leaden weight in her stomach.\n \"How...how long do I have?\"\n He hesitated. \"A year - maybe.\"\n Not enough time. Not with so much still to do. \"You will say nothing of this, of course.\" Her voice was steady.\n \"Certainly not.\"\n \"Thank you, Doctor.\"\n She had no recollection of leaving Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center or of the drive downtown. Her only thought was: I must find her before I die.\n Now the governor\u0027s speech was over.\n \"Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor and privilege to introduce Mrs. Ellen Scott.\"\n She rose to a standing ovation, then walked toward the stage, a thin, gray-haired, straight-backed woman, smartly dressed and projecting a vitality she no longer felt. Looking at me is like seeing the distant light of a long-dead star, she thought bitterly. I\u0027m not really here anymore.\n On the stage she waited for the applause to die down. They\u0027re applauding a monster. What would they do if they knew? When she spoke, her voice was firm.\n \"Mr. Vice-President, senators, Governor Adams...\"\n A year, she was thinking. I wonder where she is and if she is still alive. I must find out\n She talked on, automatically saying all the things her audience expected to hear. \"I gladly accept this tribute not for myself, but for all those who have worked so hard to lighten the burden of those who are less fortunate than we are...\"\n Her mind was drifting back forty-two years to Gary, Indiana...\n At eighteen, Ellen Dudash was employed at the Scott Industries automotive-parts plant in Gary, Indiana. She was an attractive, outgoing girl, popular with her fellow workers. On the day Milo Scott came to inspect the plant, Ellen was selected to escort him around.\n \"Hey! How about you, Ellie? Maybe you\u0027ll marry the boss\u0027s brother and we\u0027ll all be working for you.\"\n Ellen Dudash laughed. \"Right. And that\u0027s when pigs will grow wings.\"\n Milo Scott was not at all what Ellen had expected. He was in his early thirties, tall and slim. Not bad-looking, Ellen thought. He was shy and almost deferential.\n \"It\u0027s very kind of you to take the time to show me around, Miss Dudash. I hope I\u0027m not taking you away from your work.\"\n She grinned. \"I hope you are.\"\n He was so easy to talk to.\n I can\u0027t believe I\u0027m kidding around with the big boss\u0027s brother. Wait till I tell Mom and Pop about this.\n Milo seemed genuinely interested in the workers and their problems. Ellen took him through the department where the round drive gears and the long driven gears were made. She showed him through the annealing room, where the soft gears were put through a hardening process, and the packing section and the shipping department, and he seemed properly impressed.\n \"It\u0027s certainly a large operation, isn\u0027t it, Miss Dudash?\"\n He owns all of this, and he acts like an awed kid I guess it takes all kinds.\n It was in the assembly section that the accident happened. An overhead cable car carrying metal bars to the machine shop snapped and a load of iron came tumbling down. Milo Scott was directly beneath it. Ellen saw it coming a fraction of a second before it hit and, without thinking, shoved him out of harm\u0027s way. Two of the heavy iron bars hit her before she could escape, and she was knocked unconscious.\n She awakened in a private suite in a hospital. The room was literally filled with flowers. When Ellen opened her eyes and looked around, she thought: I\u0027ve died and gone to heaven.\n There were orchids and roses and lilies and chrysanthemums and rare blooms she could not even begin to identify.\n Her right arm was in a cast and her ribs were taped and felt bruised.\n A nurse came in. \"Ah, you\u0027re awake, Miss Dudash. I\u0027ll inform the doctor.\"\n \"Where - where am I?\"\n \"Blake Center - it\u0027s a private hospital.\"\n Ellen looked around the large suite. I can never afford to pay for all this.\n \"We\u0027ve been screening your calls.\"\n \"What calls?\"\n \"The press has been trying to get in to interview you. Your friends have been calling. Mr. Scott has telephoned several times...\"\n Milo Scott! \"Is he all right?\"\n \"I beg your pardon?\"\n \"Was he hurt in the accident?\"\n \"No. He was here again early this morning, but you were asleep.\"\n \"He came to see me?\"\n \"Yes.\" She looked around the room. \"Most of these flowers are from him.\"\n Unbelievable.\n \"Your mother and father are in the waiting room. Do you feel up to seeing them now?\"\n \"Of course.\"\n \"I\u0027ll send them in.\"\n Boy, I\u0027ve never been treated like this in a hospital before, Ellen thought.\n Her mother and father walked in and came up to the bed. They had been born in Poland and their English was tentative. Ellen\u0027s father was a mechanic, a burly, rough-hewn man in his fifties, and her mother was a bluff northern European peasant.\n \"I brought you some soup, Ellen.\"\n \"Mom - they feed people in hospitals.\"\n \"Not my soup they don\u0027t feed you in the hospital. Eat it and you\u0027ll get well faster.\"\n Her father said, \"Did you see the paper? I brung you a copy.\"\n He handed the newspaper to her. The headline read: FACTORY WORKER RISKS LIFE TO SAVE BOSS.\n She read the story twice.\n \"That was a brave thing you done to save him.\"\n Brave? It was stupid. If I had had time to think, I would have saved myself. That was the dumbest thing I ever did Why, I could have been killed!\n Milo Scott came to see Ellen later that morning. He was carrying another bouquet of flowers.\n \"These are for you,\" he said awkwardly. \"The doctor tells me you\u0027re going to be fine. I - I can\u0027t tell you how grateful I am to you.\"\n \"It was nothing.\"\n \"It was the most courageous act I\u0027ve ever seen. You saved my life.\"\n She tried to move, but it sent a sharp pain through her arm.\n \"Are you all right?\"\n \"Sure.\" Her side was beginning to throb. \"What did the doc say was wrong with me?\"\n \"You have a broken arm and three broken ribs.\"\n He couldn\u0027t have given her worse news. Her eyes filled with tears.\n \"What\u0027s the matter?\"\n How could she tell him? He would only laugh at her. She had been saving up for a long-awaited vacation to New York with some of the girls from the factory. It had been her dream. Now I\u0027ll be out of work for a month or more. There goes Manhattan.\n Ellen had been working since she was fifteen. She had always been fiercely independent and self-sufficient, but now she thought: Maybe if he\u0027s so grateful he\u0027ll pay part of my hospital bills. But I\u0027ll be damned if I\u0027ll ask him. She was beginning to feel drowsy. It must be the medication.\n She said sleepily, \"Thank you for all the flowers, Mr. Scott. And it was nice meeting you.\" I\u0027ll worry about the hospital bills later.\n Ellen Dudash slept.\n The following morning, a tall, distinguished-looking man came into Ellen\u0027s suite.\n \"Good morning, Miss Dudash. How are you feeling this morning?\"\n \"Better, thank you.\"\n \"I\u0027m Sam Norton, chief public-relations officer for Scott Industries.\"\n \"Oh.\" She had never seen him before. \"Do you live here?\"\n \"No. I flew in from Washington.\"\n \"To see me?\"\n \"To assist you.\"\n \"To assist me in what?\"\n \"The press is outside, Miss Dudash. Since I don\u0027t believe you\u0027ve ever held a press conference, I thought perhaps you could use some help.\"\n \"What do they want?\"\n \"Mainly, they\u0027re going to ask you to tell them about how and why you saved Mr. Scott.\"\n \"Oh. That\u0027s easy. If I had stopped to think, I\u0027d have run like hell.\"\n Norton stared at her. \"Miss Dudash - I don\u0027t think I would say that if I were you.\"\n \"Why not? It\u0027s the truth.\"\n This was not at all what he had expected. The girl seemed to have no idea of her situation.\n There was something worrying Ellen, and she decided to get it out in the open. \"Are you going to see Mr. Scott?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"Would you do me a favor?\"\n \"If I can, certainly.\"\n \"I know the accident\u0027s not his fault, and he didn\u0027t ask me to push him out of the way, but - \" The strong independent streak in her made her hesitate. \"Oh, never mind.\"\n Ah, here it comes, Norton thought. How much reward was she going to try to extort? Would it be cash? A better job? What? \"Please, go on, Miss Dudash.\"\n She blurted it out. \"The truth is, I don\u0027t have a lot of money, and I\u0027m going to lose some pay because of this, and I don\u0027t think I can afford all these hospital bills. I don\u0027t want to bother Mr. Scott, but if he could arrange a loan for me, I\u0027d pay it back.\" She saw the expression on Norton\u0027s face, and misread it. \"I\u0027m sorry. I guess I sound mercenary. It\u0027s just that I\u0027ve been saving up for a trip, and - well, this screws everything up.\" She took a deep breath. \"It\u0027s not his problem. I\u0027ll manage.\"\n Sam Norton almost kissed her. How long has it been since I\u0027ve come across real innocence? It\u0027s enough to restore my faith in womankind.\n He sat down at the side of her bed, and his professional manner disappeared. He took her hand. \"Ellen, I have a feeling you and I are going to be great friends. I promise you, you\u0027re not going to have to worry about money. But the first thing we have to do is get you through this press conference. We want you to come out of this looking good, so that - \" He stopped himself. \"I\u0027m going to be honest. My job is to see that Scott Industries comes out of this looking good. Do you understand?\"\n \"I guess so. You mean it wouldn\u0027t sound so good if I said I wasn\u0027t really interested in saving Milo Scott? It would sound better if I said something like, \u0027I like working for Scott Industries so much that when I saw Milo Scott was in danger, I knew I had to try to save him, even at the risk of my own life\u0027?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n She laughed. \"Okay. If it\u0027ll help you. But I don\u0027t want to kid you, Mr. Norton. I don\u0027t know what made me do it.\"\n He smiled. \"That will be our secret. I\u0027ll let the lions in.\"\n There were more than two dozen reporters and photographers from radio stations, newspapers, and magazines. It was a man-bites-dog story, and the press intended to make the most of it. It was not every day that a pretty young employee risked her life to save her boss\u0027s brother. And the fact that he happened to be Milo Scott did not hurt the story one bit.\n \"Miss Dudash - when you saw all that iron hurtling down at you, what was your first thought?\"\n Ellen looked over at Sam Norton with a straight face and said, \"I thought, \u0027I must save Mr. Scott. I\u0027d never forgive myself if I let him be killed.\u0027\"\n The press conference proceeded smoothly, and when Sam Norton saw that Ellen was beginning to tire, he said, \"That\u0027s it, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you very much.\"\n \"Did I do all right?\"\n \"You were great. Now get some sleep.\"\n She slept fitfully. She had a dream that she was in the lobby of the Empire State Building, but the guards would not let her go up to the top because she did not have enough money to buy a ticket.\n Milo Scott came to visit Ellen that afternoon. She was surprised to see him. She had heard that his home was in New York.\n \"I heard the press conference went very well. You\u0027re quite a heroine.\"\n \"Mr. Scott - I have to tell you something. I\u0027m not a heroine. I didn\u0027t stop to think about saving you. I - I just did it.\"\n \"I know. Sam Norton told me.\"\n \"Well, then - \"\n \"Ellen, there are all kinds of heroism. You didn\u0027t think about saving me, but you did it instinctively, instead of saving yourself.\"\n \"I - I just wanted you to know.\"\n \"Sam also told me that you\u0027re worried about the hospital bills.\"\n \"Well - \"\n \"They\u0027re all taken care of. And as for your losing some wages\" - he smiled - \"Miss Dudash, I - I don\u0027t think you know how much I owe you.\"\n \"You don\u0027t owe me anything.\"\n \"The doctor told me that you\u0027ll be leaving the hospital tomorrow. Will you let me buy you dinner?\"\n He doesn\u0027t understand, Ellen thought. I don\u0027t want his charity. Or his pity. \"I meant it when I said you don\u0027t owe me anything. Thanks for taking care of the hospital bills. We\u0027re even.\"\n \"Good. Now may I buy you dinner?\"\n That was how it began. Milo Scott stayed in Gary for a week, and he saw Ellen every night.\n Ellen\u0027s mother and father warned, \"Be careful. Big bosses don\u0027t go out with factory girls unless they want something.\"\n That had been Ellen\u0027s attitude at the beginning, but Milo changed her mind. He was a perfect gentleman at all times, and the truth finally dawned on Ellen: He really enjoys being with me.\n Where Milo was shy and reserved, Ellen was forthright and open. All his life, Milo had been surrounded by women whose burning ambition was to become a part of the powerful Scott dynasty. They had played their calculating games. Ellen Dudash was the first totally honest woman Milo had ever met. She said exactly what was on her mind. She was bright, she was attractive, and, most of all, she was fun to be with. By the end of the week, they were both falling in love.\n \"I want to marry you,\" Milo said. \"I can\u0027t think about anything else. Will you marry me?\"\n \"No.\"\n Nor had Ellen been able to think about anything else. The truth was that she was terrified. The Scotts were as close as America could come to royalty. They were famous, rich, and powerful. I don\u0027t belong in their circle. I would only make a fool of myself. And of Milo. But she knew she was fighting a losing battle.\n They were married by a justice of the peace in Greenwich, Connecticut, and then took a trip to Manhattan so that Ellen Dudash could meet her in-laws.\n Byron Scott greeted his brother with, \"What the fuck have you done - marry a Polish hooker? Are you out of your mind?\"\n Susan Scott was just as ungiving. \"Of course she married Milo for his money. When she finds out he doesn\u0027t have any, we\u0027ll arrange an annulment. This marriage will never last.\"\n They badly underestimated Ellen Dudash.\n \"Your brother and sister-in-law hate me, but I didn\u0027t marry them. I married you. I don\u0027t want to come between you and Byron. If this is making you too unhappy, Milo, say so, and I\u0027ll leave.\"\n He took his bride in his arms and whispered, \"I adore you, and when Byron and Susan really get to know you, they\u0027ll adore you too.\"\n She held him closely and thought: How naive he is. And how I love him.\n Byron and Susan were not unpleasant to their new sister-in-law. They were patronizing. To them, she would always be the little Polish girl who worked in one of the Scott factories.\n Ellen studied, and read, and learned. She watched how the wives of Milo\u0027s friends dressed, and copied them. She was determined to become a fit wife to Milo Scott, and in time she succeeded. But not in the eyes of her in-laws. And slowly her naivete turned to cynicism. The rich and powerful aren\u0027t all that wonderful, she thought. All they want is to be richer and more powerful\n Ellen was fiercely protective of Milo, but there was little she could do to help him. Scott Industries was one of the few privately held conglomerates in the world, and all the stock belonged to Byron. Byron\u0027s younger brother was a salaried employee, and he never let Milo forget it. He treated his brother shabbily. Milo was given all the dirty jobs to do, and was never given any credit.\n \"Why do you put up with it, Milo? You don\u0027t need him. We could move away from here. You could start your own business.\"\n \"I couldn\u0027t leave Scott Industries. Byron needs me.\"\n But in time, Ellen came to understand the real reason. Milo was weak. He needed someone strong to lean on. She knew then that he would never have the courage to leave the company.\n All right, she thought fiercely. One day the company will be his. Byron can\u0027t live forever. Milo is his only heir.\n When Susan Scott announced that she was pregnant, it was a blow to Ellen. The baby\u0027s going to inherit everything.\n When the baby was born, Byron said, \"It\u0027s a girl, but I\u0027ll teach her how to run the company.\"\n The bastard, Ellen thought. Her heart ached for Milo.\n All Milo said was, \"Isn\u0027t she a beautiful baby?\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-sands-of-time/page-16.html","bookId":2361,"book":{"id":2361,"title":"The Sands of Time","description":"Storyline: \n Four nuns find themselves suddenly thrust into a hostile world they long ago abandoned for the safety of the convent. nwittingly they become pawns in a battle between the charismatic Jaime Miró, leader of the outlawed Basque nationalists, and the ruthless Colonel Ramón Acoca of the Spanish Amy. \n Four women - and the men they are forbidden to love. \n Megan - the orphan, who feels an overpowering attraction to Jaime. \n Lucia - the fiery Sicilian beauty on the run for murder - and Rubio Arzano, the freedom fighter who risks his life to save her. \n Teresa - whose guilty conscience finally drives her to betray her friends. \n Graciela - who bears a terrible secret thet almost destroys her - and the courageous Ricardo who loves her.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-sands-of-time.jpg","author":"Sidney Sheldon","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-sands-of-time.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:39 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:08:20 AM"}}
