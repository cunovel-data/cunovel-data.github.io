{"id":68291,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"For Sister Megan, the journey was an adventure. She had gotten used to the new sights and sounds that surrounded her, and the speed with which she had adapted surprised her. She found her companions fascinating. Amparo Jiron was a powerful woman, easily able to keep up with the two men, and yet at the same time she was very feminine. Felix Carpio, the husky man with a reddish beard and a scar, seemed amiable and pleasant. But to Megan, the most compelling of the group was Jaime Miro. There was a relentless strength about him, an unshakable faith in his beliefs that reminded Megan of the nuns in the convent. When they began the journey, Jaime, Amparo, and Felix were carrying sleeping bags and rifles on their shoulders. \"Let me carry one of the sleeping bags,\" Megan suggested. Jaime Miro had looked at her in surprise, then shrugged. \"All right, Sister.\" He handed her the bag. It was heavier than Megan had expected, but she did not complain. As long as I\u0027m with them, I\u0027m going to do my share. It seemed to Megan that they had been walking forever, stumbling through the darkness, getting hit by branches, scratched by underbrush, attacked by insects, guided only by the light of the moon. Who are these people? Megan wondered. And why are they being hunted? Because Megan and the other nuns were also being pursued, she felt a strong rapport with her new companions. There was little talking, but from time to time they held cryptic conversations. \"Is everything set at Valladolid?\" \"Right, Jaime. Rubio and Tomas will meet us at the bank during the bullfight.\" \"Good. Send word to Largo Cortez to expect us. But don\u0027t give him a date.\" \"Comprendo.\" Who are Largo Cortez and Rubio and Tomas? Megan wondered. And what was going to happen at the bullfight and the bank? She almost started to ask, but thought better of it. I have a feeling they wouldn\u0027t welcome a lot of questions. Near dawn they smelled smoke from the valley below them. \"Wait here,\" Jaime whispered. \"Be quiet.\" They watched as he made his way toward the edge of the forest and disappeared from sight. Megan said, \"What is it?\" \"Shut up!\" Amparo Jiron hissed. Fifteen minutes later Jaime Miro returned. \"Soldiers. We\u0027ll circle around them.\" They backtracked for half a mile, then moved cautiously through the woods until they reached a side road. The countryside stretched out ahead of them, redolent with the odors of mowed hay and ripe fruit. Megan\u0027s curiosity got the better of her. \"Why are the soldiers looking for you?\" she asked. Jaime said, \"Let\u0027s say we don\u0027t see eye to eye.\" And she had to be satisfied with that. For now, she thought. She was determined to know more about this man. Half an hour later, when they reached a sheltered clearing, Jaime said, \"The sun\u0027s up. We\u0027ll stay here until nightfall.\" He looked at Megan. \"Tonight we\u0027re going to have to travel faster.\" She nodded. \"Very well.\" Jaime took the sleeping bags and rolled them out. Felix Carpio said to Megan, \"You take mine, Sister. I\u0027m used to sleeping on the ground.\" \"It\u0027s yours,\" Megan said. \"I couldn\u0027t - \" \"For Christ\u0027s sake,\" Amparo snapped. \"Get in the bag. We don\u0027t want you to keep us up screaming about goddamned spiders.\" There was an animosity in her tone that Megan did not understand. Without another word, Megan climbed into the sleeping bag. What\u0027s bothering her? she wondered. Megan watched as Jaime unrolled his sleeping bag a few feet away from where she lay, then crawled into it. Amparo Jiron crawled in beside him. I see, Megan thought. Jaime looked over at Megan. \"You\u0027d better get some sleep,\" he said. \"We have a long way ahead of us.\" Megan was awakened by a moaning. It sounded as though someone were in terrible pain. She sat up, concerned. The sounds were coming from Jaime\u0027s sleeping bag. He must be terribly ill, was her first thought. The moaning was getting louder, and then Megan heard Amparo Jiron\u0027s voice saying, \"Oh, yes, yes. Give it to me, querido. Harder! Yes! Now! Now!\" And Megan\u0027s face flushed. She tried to close her ears to the sounds she was hearing, but it was impossible. And she wondered what it would be like to have Jaime Miro make love to her. Instantly Megan crossed herself and began to pray: Forgive me, Father. Let my thoughts be filled only with You. Let my spirit seek You that it may find its source and good in You. And the sounds went on. Finally, when Megan thought she would be unable to bear it an instant longer, they stopped. But there were other noises keeping her awake. The sounds of the forest ricocheted around her. There was a cacophony of mating birds and crickets and the chattering of small animals and the guttural growlings of larger ones. Megan had forgotten how noisy the outside world could be. She missed the wonderful silence of the convent. To her own astonishment, she even missed the orphanage. The terrible, wonderful orphanage...","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-sands-of-time/page-14.html","bookId":2361,"book":{"id":2361,"title":"The Sands of Time","description":"Storyline: Four nuns find themselves suddenly thrust into a hostile world they long ago abandoned for the safety of the convent. nwittingly they become pawns in a battle between the charismatic Jaime Miró, leader of the outlawed Basque nationalists, and the ruthless Colonel Ramón Acoca of the Spanish Amy.
