{"id":68314,"no":37,"title":"Page 37","content":"High on a hill above the convent, Jaime and the others observed Acoca and his men move in on the van. They saw the terrified passengers get out, hands raised, and watched the scene played out in pantomime.\\n\\n Jaime could almost hear the dialogue:\\n\\n Who are you?\\n\\n We work at a hotel outside Logrono.\\n\\n What are you doing here?\\n\\n A man gave us five thousand pesetas to deliver this van to the convent.\\n\\n What man?\\n\\n I don\u0027t know. I never saw him before.\\n\\n Is this his picture?\\n\\n Yes. That\u0027s him.\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s get out of here,\" Jaime said.\\n\\n They were in a white station wagon, heading back to Logrono. Megan was looking at Jaime in wonder.\\n\\n \"How did you know?\"\\n\\n \"That Colonel Acoca would be waiting for us at the convent? He told me.\"\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"The fox has to think like the hunter, Megan. I put myself in Acoca\u0027s place. Where would he set a trap for me? He did exactly what I would have done.\"\\n\\n \"And if he had not shown up?\"\\n\\n \"Then it would have been safe to take you into the convent.\"\\n\\n \"What happens now?\" Felix asked.\\n\\n It was the question uppermost in all their minds.\\n\\n \"Spain isn\u0027t safe for any of us for a while,\" Jaime decided. \"We\u0027ll head directly for San Sebastian and into France.\" He looked at Megan. \"There are Cistercian convents there.\"\\n\\n It was more than Amparo could bear.\\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t you give yourself up? If you keep on this way, there will be more blood spilled and more lives taken - \"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve lost the right to speak,\" Jaime said curtly. \"Just be grateful you\u0027re still alive.\" He turned to Megan. \"There are ten mountain passes across the Pyrenees leading from San Sebastian to France. We\u0027ll cross there.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s too dangerous,\" Felix objected. \"Acoca\u0027s going to be looking for us in San Sebastian. He\u0027ll be expecting us to cross the border into France.\"\\n\\n \"If it\u0027s that dangerous - \" Graciela began.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t worry,\" Jaime assured her. \"San Sebastian is Basque country.\"\\n\\n The station wagon was approaching the outskirts of Logrono again.\\n\\n \"All the roads to San Sebastian will be watched,\" Felix warned. \"How do you plan for us to get there?\"\\n\\n Jaime had already decided. \"We\u0027ll take the train.\"\\n\\n \"The soldiers will be searching the trains,\" Ricardo objected.\\n\\n Jaime gave Amparo a thoughtful look. \"No. I don\u0027t think so. Our friend here is going to help us. Do you know how to reach Colonel Acoca?\"\\n\\n She hesitated. \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"Good. You\u0027re going to call him.\"\\n\\n They stopped at one of the telephone booths along the highway. Jaime followed Amparo into the booth and closed the door. He was holding a pistol to her side.\\n\\n \"You know what to say?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n He watched her dial a number, and when a voice answered, she said, \"This is Amparo Jiron. Colonel Acoca is expecting my call...Thank you.\" She looked up at Jaime. \"They\u0027re putting me through.\" The gun was pressing against her. \"Do you have to - ?\"\\n\\n \"Just do as you were told.\" His voice was ice.\\n\\n A moment later, Jaime heard Acoca\u0027s voice come over the phone. \"Where are you?\"\\n\\n The gun pressed against her harder. \"I - I\u0027m - we\u0027re just leaving Logrono.\"\\n\\n \"Do you know where our friends are going?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n Jaime\u0027s face was inches from hers, his eyes hard.\\n\\n \"They\u0027ve decided to reverse themselves to throw you off. They\u0027re on their way to Barcelona. He\u0027s driving a white Seat. He\u0027ll be taking the main highway.\"\\n\\n Jaime nodded at her.\\n\\n \"I - I have to go now. The car is here.\"\\n\\n Jaime pressed down the receiver. \"Very good. Let\u0027s go. We\u0027ll give him half an hour to call off his men here.\"\\n\\n Thirty minutes later they were at the railroad station.\\n\\n There were three classes of trains from Logrono to San Sebastian: The TALGO was the luxury train; the second-class train was the TER; and the worst and cheapest trains, uncomfortable and dirty, were misnamed the expresos - they stopped at every little station from Logrono to San Sebastian.\\n\\n Jaime said, \"We\u0027ll take the expreso. By now all of Acoca\u0027s men will be busy stopping every white Seat on the road to Barcelona. We\u0027ll buy our tickets separately and meet in the last car of the train.\" Jaime turned to Amparo. \"You go first. I\u0027ll be right behind you.\"\\n\\n She knew why, and hated him for it. If Colonel Acoca had set a trap, she would be the bait. Well, she was Amparo Jiron. She would not flinch.\\n\\n She walked into the station while Jaime and the others watched. There were no soldiers.\\n\\n They\u0027re all out covering the highway to Barcelona. It\u0027s going to be a madhouse, Jaime thought wryly. Every other car is a white Seat\\n\\n One by one the group purchased their tickets and headed for the train. They boarded without incident. Jaime took the seat next to Megan. Amparo sat in front of them, next to Felix. Across the way Ricardo and Graciela sat together.\\n\\n Jaime said to Megan, \"We\u0027ll reach San Sebastian in three hours. We\u0027ll spend the night there and in the early morning we\u0027ll cross over into France.\"\\n\\n \"And after we get to France?\"\\n\\n She was thinking of what would happen to Jaime, but when he replied, he said, \"Don\u0027t worry. There\u0027s a Cistercian convent just a few hours across the border.\" He hesitated. \"If that\u0027s what you still want.\"\\n\\n So he had understood her doubts. Is that what I want? They were coming to more than a border that divided two countries. This border would divide her old life from her future life...which would be...what? She had been desperate to return to a convent, but now she was filled with doubts. She had forgotten how exciting the world outside the walls could be. I\u0027ve never felt so alive. Megan looked over at Jaime and admitted to herself: And Jaime Miro is a part of it\\n\\n He caught her glance and looked into her eyes, and Megan thought: He knows it.\\n\\n The expreso stopped at every hamlet and village along the track. The train was packed with farmers and their wives, merchants and salesmen, and at each stop passengers noisily embarked and disembarked.\\n\\n The expreso made its way slowly through the mountains, fighting the steep grades.\\n\\n When the train finally pulled into the station in San Sebastian, Jaime said to Megan, \"The danger is over. This is our city. I\u0027ve arranged for a car to be here for us.\"\\n\\n A large sedan was waiting in front of the station. A driver wearing a chapella, the big, wide-brimmed beret of the Basques, greeted Jaime with warm hugs, and the group got into the car.\\n\\n Megan noticed that Jaime stayed close to Amparo, ready to grab her if she tried to make a move. What\u0027s he going to do to her? Megan wondered.\\n\\n \"We were worried about you, Jaime,\" the driver said. \"According to the press, Colonel Acoca is conducting a big hunt for you.\"\\n\\n Jaime laughed. \"Let him keep hunting, Gil. I am out of season.\"\\n\\n They drove down the Avenida Sancho el Savio, toward the beach. It was a cloudless summer day and the streets were crowded with strolling couples bent on pleasure. The harbor was awash with yachts and smaller craft. The distant mountains formed a picturesque backdrop for the city. Everything seemed so peaceful.\\n\\n \"What are the arrangements?\" Jaime asked the driver.\\n\\n \"The Hotel Niza. Largo Cortez is waiting for you.\"\\n\\n \"It will be good to see the old pirate again.\"\\n\\n The Niza was a medium-class hotel in the Plaza Juan de Olezabal, off the Calle de San Martin on the corner of a busy square. It was a white building with brown shutters and a big blue sign at the top. The rear of the hotel backed onto a beach.\\n\\n When the car pulled up in front of the hotel, the group got out and followed Jaime into the lobby.\\n\\n Largo Cortez, the hotel owner, ran up to greet them. He was a large man. He had only one arm as the result of a daring exploit, and he moved awkwardly, as though off-balance.\\n\\n \"Welcome,\" he said, beaming. \"I have been expecting you for a week now.\"\\n\\n Jaime shrugged. \"We had a few delays, amigo.\"\\n\\n Largo Cortez grinned. \"I read about them. The papers are full of nothing else.\" He turned to look at Megan and Graciela. \"Everyone is rooting for you, Sisters. I have your rooms all prepared.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll be staying overnight,\" Jaime told him. \"We\u0027ll leave first thing in the morning and cross into France. I want a good guide who knows all the passes - either Cabrera Infante or Jose Cebrian.\"\\n\\n \"I will arrange it,\" the hotel owner assured him. \"There will be six of you?\"\\n\\n Jaime glanced at Amparo. \"Five.\"\\n\\n Amparo looked away.\\n\\n \"I suggest that none of you registers,\" Cortez said. \"What the police don\u0027t know won\u0027t hurt them. Why don\u0027t you let me take you to your rooms, where you can refresh yourselves? Then we\u0027ll have a magnificent supper.\"\\n\\n \"Amparo and I are going to the bar to have a drink,\" Jaime said. \"We\u0027ll join you later.\"\\n\\n Largo Cortez nodded. \"As you wish, Jaime.\"\\n\\n Megan was watching Jaime, puzzled. She wondered what he planned to do with Amparo. Is he going to cold-bloodedly - ? She could not bear even to think about it.\\n\\n Amparo was wondering too, but she was too proud to ask.\\n\\n Jaime led her into the bar at the far end of the lobby and took a table in the corner.\\n\\n When the waiter approached them, Jaime said, \"A glass of wine, por favor.\"\\n\\n \"One?\"\\n\\n \"One.\"\\n\\n Amparo watched as Jaime took out a small packet and opened it. It contained a fine, powdery substance.\\n\\n \"Jaime - \" There was desperation in Amparo\u0027s voice. \"Please listen to me! Try to understand why I did what I did. You\u0027re tearing the country apart. Your cause is hopeless. You must stop this insanity.\"\\n\\n The waiter reappeared and set a glass of wine on the table. When he walked away, Jaime carefully poured the contents of the packet into the glass and stirred it. He pushed the glass in front of Amparo.\\n\\n \"Drink it.\"\\n\\n \"No!\"\\n\\n \"Not many of us are privileged to choose the way we die,\" Jaime said quietly. \"This way will be quick and painless. If I turn you over to my people, I can\u0027t make any such promise.\"\\n\\n \"Jaime - I loved you once. You must believe me. Please - \"\\n\\n \"Drink it.\" His voice was implacable.\\n\\n Amparo looked at him for a long moment, then picked up the glass. \"I\u0027ll drink to your death.\"\\n\\n He watched as Amparo put the glass to her lips and swallowed the wine in one gulp.\\n\\n She shuddered. \"What happens now?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll help you upstairs. I\u0027ll put you to bed. You\u0027ll sleep.\"\\n\\n Amparo\u0027s eyes filled with tears. \"You\u0027re a fool,\" she whispered. \"Jaime - I\u0027m dying, and I tell you that I loved you so - \" Her words were beginning to slur.\\n\\n Jaime rose and helped Amparo to her feet. She stood up, unsteady. The room seemed to be rocking.\\n\\n \"Jaime - \"\\n\\n He guided her out the door and into the lobby, holding her up. Largo Cortez was waiting for him with a key.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll take her to her room,\" Jaime said. \"See that she\u0027s not disturbed.\"\\n\\n \"Right.\"\\n\\n Cortez watched as Jaime half-carried Amparo up the stairs.\\n\\n In her room, Megan was thinking how strange it felt to be by herself in a hotel in a resort town. San Sebastian was filled with people on vacation, honeymooners, lovers enjoying themselves in a hundred other hotel rooms. And suddenly Megan wished Jaime were there with her, and wondered what it would be like to have him make love to her. All the feelings that she had been suppressing for so long came flooding into her mind in a wild torrent of emotions.\\n\\n But what did Jaime do to Amparo? Could he possibly have...but no, he could never have done that. Or could he? I want him, she thought. Oh, Lord, what\u0027s happening to me? What can I do?\\n\\n Ricardo was whistling as he dressed. He was in a wonderful mood. I\u0027m the luckiest man in the world, he thought. We\u0027ll be married in France. There\u0027s a beautiful church across the border in Bayonne. Tomorrow...\\n\\n In her room, Graciela was taking a bath, luxuriating in the warm water, thinking of Ricardo. She smiled to herself and thought: I\u0027m going to make him so happy. Thank You, God.\\n\\n Felix Carpio was thinking about Jaime and Megan. A blind man can see the electricity between them, he thought. It is going to bring bad luck. Nuns belong to God. It\u0027s bad enough that Ricardo has taken Sister Graciela from her calling. But Jaime had always been reckless. What was he going to do about this one?\\n\\n The five of them met for supper in the hotel dining room. No one mentioned Amparo.\\n\\n Looking at Jaime, Megan felt suddenly embarrassed, as though he could read her mind.\\n\\n It\u0027s better not to ask questions, she decided. I know he could never do anything brutal\\n\\n They found that Largo Cortez had not exaggerated about the supper. The meal began with gazpacho - the thick cold soup made from tomatoes, cucumbers, and water-soaked bread - followed by a salad of fresh greens, a huge dish of paella - rice, shrimp, chicken, and vegetables in a wonderful sauce - and ended with a delicious flan. It was the first hot meal Ricardo and Graciela had had in a long time.\\n\\n When the meal was over, Megan rose. \"I should be getting to bed.\"\\n\\n \"Wait,\" Jaime said. \"I have to talk to you.\" He escorted her to a deserted corner of the lobby. \"About tomorrow...\"\\n\\n \"Yes?\"\\n\\n And she knew what he was going to ask. What she did not know was what she was going to answer. I\u0027ve changed, Megan thought. I was so sure about my life before. I believed I had everything I wanted\\n\\n Jaime was saying, \"You don\u0027t really want to go back to a convent, do you?\"\\n\\n Do I?\\n\\n He was waiting for an answer.\\n\\n I have to be honest with him, Megan thought. She looked into his eyes and said, \"I don\u0027t know what I want, Jaime. I\u0027m confused.\"\\n\\n Jaime smiled. He hesitated, choosing his words carefully. \"Megan - this fight will be over soon. We\u0027ll get what we want because the people are behind us. I can\u0027t ask you to share the danger with me now, but I would like you to wait for me. I have an aunt living in France. You would be safe with her.\"\\n\\n Megan looked at him a long time before she answered. \"Jaime - give me time to think about it.\"\\n\\n \"Then you\u0027re not saying no?\"\\n\\n Megan said quietly, \"I\u0027m not saying no.\"\\n\\n None of the group slept that night. They had too much to think about, too many conflicts to resolve.\\n\\n Megan stayed awake reliving the past. The years in the orphanage, and the sanctuary of the convent. Then the sudden expulsion into a world she had given up forever. Jaime Miro was risking his life fighting for what he believed in. And what do I believe in? Megan asked herself. How do I want to spend the rest of my life?\\n\\n She had made a choice once. Now she was forced to choose again. She would have to have an answer by morning.\\n\\n Graciela was thinking about the convent too. They were such happy, peaceful years. I felt so close to God. Will I miss that?\\n\\n Jaime was thinking about Megan. She mustn\u0027t go back. I want her at my side. What will her answer be?\\n\\n Ricardo was too excited to sleep, busily making plans for the wedding. The church at Bayonne...\\n\\n Felix was wondering how to dispose of Amparo\u0027s body. Let Largo Cortez take care of it.\\n\\n Early the following morning, the group met in the lobby. Jaime approached Megan.\\n\\n \"Good morning.\"\\n\\n \"Good morning.\"\\n\\n \"Have you thought about our conversation?\"\\n\\n She had thought of nothing else all night. \"Yes, Jaime.\"\\n\\n He looked into her eyes, trying to read the answer there. \"Will you wait for me?\"\\n\\n \"Jaime - \"\\n\\n At that moment Largo Cortez hurried up to them. With him was a leathery-looking man in his fifties.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m afraid there won\u0027t be any time for breakfast,\" Cortez said. \"You should be leaving. This is Jose Cebrian, your guide. He will take you across the mountains into France. He\u0027s the best guide in San Sebastian.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m glad to see you, Jose,\" Jaime said. \"What\u0027s your plan?\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re going to take the first part of the journey by foot,\" Jose Cebrian told the group. \"On the other side of the border, I\u0027ve arranged for cars to be waiting for us. We should hurry. Come along, please.\"\\n\\n The group moved out into the street, which was painted yellow by the rays of the bright sun.\\n\\n Largo Cortez came out of the hotel to see them off. \"Safe journey,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Thank you for everything,\" Jaime replied. \"We\u0027ll be back, amigo. Sooner than you think.\"\\n\\n \"We go this way,\" Jose Cebrian ordered.\\n\\n The group started to turn toward the square. And at that moment, soldiers and members of the GOE suddenly materialized at both ends of the street, sealing it off. There were at least a dozen of them, all heavily armed. Colonels Ramon Acoca and Fal Sostelo were leading them.\\n\\n Jaime glanced quickly toward the beach, looking for an escape route. Another dozen soldiers were approaching from that direction. There was no escape. They would have to fight. Jaime instinctively reached for his gun.\\n\\n Colonel Acoca called out, \"Don\u0027t even think about it, Miro, or we\u0027ll shoot all of you down where you\u0027re standing.\"\\n\\n Jaime\u0027s mind was racing furiously, looking for a way out. How had Acoca known where to find him? Jaime turned and saw Amparo standing in the doorway, a look of profound sorrow on her face.\\n\\n Felix said, \"What the bloody hell! I thought you - \"\\n\\n \"I gave her sleeping pills. They should have knocked her out until we got across the border.\"\\n\\n \"The bitch!\"\\n\\n Colonel Acoca walked toward Jaime. \"It\u0027s over.\" He turned to one of his men. \"Disarm them.\"\\n\\n Felix and Ricardo were looking toward Jaime for guidance, ready to follow his lead. Jaime shook his head. Reluctantly, he handed over his gun, and Felix and Ricardo followed suit.\\n\\n \"What are you going to do with us?\" Jaime asked.\\n\\n Several passersby stopped to watch the proceedings.\\n\\n Colonel Acoca\u0027s voice was curt. \"I\u0027m taking you and your gang of murderers back to Madrid. We\u0027ll give you a fair military trial and then hang you. If I had my way, I\u0027d hang you here now.\"\\n\\n \"Let the sisters go,\" Jaime said. \"They had nothing to do with this.\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027re accomplices. They\u0027re as guilty as you are.\"\\n\\n Colonel Acoca turned and gave a signal. The soldiers motioned to the growing crowd of onlookers to move aside and let three army trucks drive up.\\n\\n \"You and your assassins will ride in the middle truck,\" the colonel informed Jaime. \"My men will be in front of you and in back of you. If any of you makes one false move, they have orders to kill all of you. Do you understand?\"\\n\\n Jaime nodded.\\n\\n Colonel Acoca spat into Jaime\u0027s face. \"Good. Into the truck.\"\\n\\n There was an angry murmur from the now sizable crowd.\\n\\n Amparo watched impassively from the doorway as Jaime, Megan, Graciela, Ricardo, and Felix climbed into the truck, surrounded by soldiers with automatic weapons.\\n\\n Colonel Sostelo walked up to the driver of the first truck. \"We\u0027ll head straight for Madrid. No stops along the way.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, Colonel.\"\\n\\n By now, many people had gathered at both ends of the street to watch what was happening. Colonel Acoca started to climb into the first truck. He called out to those in front of the truck, \"Clear the way.\"\\n\\n From the side streets more people began to emerge.\\n\\n \"Move along,\" Acoca ordered. \"Out of the way.\"\\n\\n And still they came, the men wearing the wide Basque chapellas. It was as though they were responding to some invisible signal. Jaime Miro is in trouble. They came from shops and homes. Housewives dropped what they were doing and moved out into the street. Shopkeepers about to open for business heard the news and hurried to the hotel. And still they came. Artists and plumbers and doctors, mechanics and salesmen and students, many carrying shotguns and rifles, axes and scythes. They were Basques, and this was their homeland. It started with a few, and then a hundred, and within minutes it had swollen to more than a thousand, filling the sidewalks and streets, completely surrounding the army trucks. They were ominously silent.\\n\\n Colonel Acoca observed the huge crowd in desperation. He screamed, \"Everybody get out of the way or we\u0027ll start shooting.\"\\n\\n Jaime called out, \"I wouldn\u0027t advise it. These people hate you for what you\u0027re trying to do to them. A word from me and they\u0027ll tear you and your men to pieces. There\u0027s one thing you forgot, Colonel. San Sebastian is a Basque town. It\u0027s my town.\" He turned to his group. \"Let\u0027s get out of here.\"\\n\\n Jaime helped Megan down from the truck, and the others followed. Acoca watched helplessly, his face tight with fury.\\n\\n The crowd was waiting, hostile and silent. Jaime walked up to the colonel. \"Take your trucks and get back to Madrid.\"\\n\\n Acoca looked around at the still growing mob. \"I - you won\u0027t get away with this, Miro.\"\\n\\n \"I have gotten away with it. Now get out of here.\" He spat in Acoca\u0027s face.\\n\\n The colonel stared at him for a long, murderous moment. It can\u0027t end this way, he thought desperately. I was so close. It was checkmate. But he knew that it was worse than a defeat for him. It was a death sentence. The OPUS MUNDO would be waiting for him in Madrid. He looked at the sea of people surrounding him. He had no choice.\\n\\n He turned to his driver, and his voice was choked with fury. \"We\u0027re moving out.\"\\n\\n The crowd stepped back, watching as the soldiers climbed into the trucks. A moment later, the trucks began to roll down the street, and the crowd began to cheer wildly. It started out as a cheer for Jaime Miro, and it grew louder and louder, and soon they were cheering for their freedom, and their fight against tyranny, and their coming victory, and the streets reverberated with the noise of their celebration.\\n\\n Two teenagers were screaming themselves hoarse. One turned to the other. \"Let\u0027s join ETA.\"\\n\\n An elderly couple held each other, and the woman said, \"Now maybe they\u0027ll give us back our farm.\"\\n\\n An old man stood alone in the crowd, silently watching the army trucks leave. When he spoke, he said, \"They\u0027ll be back one day.\"\\n\\n Jaime took Megan\u0027s hand and said, \"It\u0027s over. We\u0027re free. We\u0027ll be across the border in an hour. I\u0027ll take you to my aunt.\"\\n\\n She looked into his eyes. \"Jaime - \"\\n\\n A man pushed his way toward them through the crowd and hurried up to Megan.\\n\\n \"Excuse me,\" he said breathlessly. \"Are you Sister Megan?\"\\n\\n She turned to him. \"Yes.\"\\n\\n He breathed a sigh of relief. \"I\u0027ve had quite a time finding you. My name is Alan Tucker. I wonder if I could speak to you for a moment?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"Alone.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry. I\u0027m just leaving for - \"\\n\\n \"Please. This is very important. I\u0027ve come all the way from New York to find you.\"\\n\\n She looked at him, puzzled. \"To find me? I don\u0027t understand. Why - ?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll explain it to you, if you\u0027ll give me a moment.\"\\n\\n The stranger took her arm and walked her down the street, talking rapidly. She glanced back once at where Jaime Miro stood waiting for her.\\n\\n Megan\u0027s conversation with Alan Tucker turned her world upside down.\\n\\n \"The woman I represent would like to see you.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t understand. What woman? What does she want with me?\"\\n\\n I wish I knew the answer to that, Alan Tucker thought. \"I\u0027m not at liberty to discuss that. She\u0027s waiting for you in New York.\"\\n\\n It made no sense. There must be some mistake. \"Are you sure you have the right person - Sister Megan?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. But your name isn\u0027t Megan. It\u0027s Patricia.\"\\n\\n And in a sudden, blinding flash, Megan knew. After all these years, her fantasy was about to come true. She was finally going to learn who she was. The very idea of it was thrilling...and terrifying.\\n\\n \"When - when would I have to leave?\" Her throat was suddenly so dry, she could barely speak the words.\\n\\n I want you to find out where she is and bring her back as quickly as possible.\\n\\n \"Right away. I\u0027ll arrange a passport for you.\"\\n\\n She turned and saw Jaime standing in front of the hotel, waiting.\\n\\n \"Excuse me a moment.\"\\n\\n Megan walked back to Jaime in a daze, and she felt as though she were living a dream.\\n\\n \"Are you all right?\" Jaime asked. \"Is that man bothering you?\"\\n\\n \"No. He\u0027s - no.\"\\n\\n He took Megan\u0027s hand. \"I want you to come with me now. We belong together, Megan.\"\\n\\n Your name isn\u0027t Megan. It\u0027s Patricia.\\n\\n She looked at Jaime\u0027s strong, handsome face, and thought: I want us to be together. But we\u0027ll have to wait First I have to find out who I am.\\n\\n \"Jaime - I want to be with you. But there is something I have to do first.\"\\n\\n He studied her, his face troubled. \"You\u0027re going to leave?\"\\n\\n \"For a little while. But I\u0027ll be back.\"\\n\\n He looked at her for a long time, then slowly nodded. \"All right. You can reach me through Largo Cortez.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll come back to you. I promise.\"\\n\\n And she meant it. But that was before the meeting with Ellen Scott. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-sands-of-time/page-37.html","bookId":2361,"book":{"id":2361,"title":"The Sands of Time","description":"Storyline: Four nuns find themselves suddenly thrust into a hostile world they long ago abandoned for the safety of the convent. nwittingly they become pawns in a battle between the charismatic Jaime Miró, leader of the outlawed Basque nationalists, and the ruthless Colonel Ramón Acoca of the Spanish Amy. \\n Four women - and the men they are forbidden to love. \\n Megan - the orphan, who feels an overpowering attraction to Jaime. \\n Lucia - the fiery Sicilian beauty on the run for murder - and Rubio Arzano, the freedom fighter who risks his life to save her. \\n Teresa - whose guilty conscience finally drives her to betray her friends. \\n Graciela - who bears a terrible secret thet almost destroys her - and the courageous Ricardo who loves her.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-sands-of-time.jpg","author":"Sidney Sheldon","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-sands-of-time.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:39 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:08:20 AM"}}
