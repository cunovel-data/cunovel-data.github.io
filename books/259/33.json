Lynch him!” “What\u0027s up?” asked the tramp drowsily, opening his eyes. “Bring out the hoss thief!” cried a dozen rough voices, as the battering at the door was repeated. “They want you, young feller!” he continued, as he caught the meaning of the cry. “What shall we do?” asked Walter helplessly. “They don\u0027t want me,” returned the tramp complacently. “It\u0027s you they want!” “You will stand by me?” implored Walter, eager for any help. “Won\u0027t do no good! There\u0027s a crowd of them. You\u0027re in a bad box, young feller!” “Have you got a pistol?” “No.” Then it flashed upon Walter that he still had the revolver which belonged to Dick Ranney. “I will sell my life dearly!” thought Walter, “They shan\u0027t kill me without some resistance.” “Open the door, or it\u0027ll be wuss for ye!” cried a rough voice.
