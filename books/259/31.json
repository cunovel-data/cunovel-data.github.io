{"id":7824,"no":31,"title":"CHAPTER XXX WALTER FINDS HIMSELF IN A TIGHT PLACE","content":"Walter had hardly time to consider what to do in the light of the discovery he had made before the matter was taken out of his hands. “Young feller, you\u0027d better get off that hoss!” fell on his ears in a rough voice. He turned, and saw two stalwart men eyeing him suspiciously. “Gentlemen,” said Walter earnestly, “till I read this notice I had no idea that the horse was stolen.” “That\u0027s neither here nor there. You\u0027d better get off the hoss.” Walter felt that this was a command, and obeyed at once. “Very well, gentlemen,” he said. “I will leave the horse in your hands, and depend upon you to return it to the owner.” As Walter spoke he turned to walk off, but the man who had first accosted him got in his way. “I don\u0027t want to have any trouble with you, sir. Please get out of my way, and let me go.” “Not by a long shot.” “What do you propose to do with me?” “Take you to the lockup.” Walter was now really alarmed. “You\u0027ll have to go with us, young feller!” said Crane. “And leave the hoss?” asked Penton. “We\u0027d ought to take charge of it, and get the reward.” “That\u0027s so, Penton. You go and get a constable. We\u0027ll stand by the hoss.” Penton hurried off, and returned shortly with a constable in uniform. “What\u0027s up?” he asked. “This young feller\u0027s rid into town with Colonel Richard Owen\u0027s hoss.” “But I\u0027d ought to secure the hoss,” said the constable, who felt that perhaps he might be entitled to the reward offered. “Look here, Cyrus Stokes, you secure the thief—that\u0027s your lookout.” “Gentlemen,” said Walter, “I object to being called a thief. I have already told you I did not steal the horse.” The constable seized Walter by the arm and walked off with him. To add to his mortification, people whom they met on the street looked at him curiously. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3022/83606.html","bookId":259,"book":{"id":259,"title":"Walter Sherwood\u0027s Probation","description":"简介： Here\u0027s a letter for you, Doctor Mack, said the housekeeper, as she entered the plain room used as a library and sitting-room by her employer, Doctor Ezekiel Mack.
