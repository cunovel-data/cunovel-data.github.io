{"id":101898,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"\"Is she gone?\"\n \"One sec.\" Audrey, our tour leader and co-owner of Sgt. Patty\u0027s Lonely Hearts Club Tours, peeked out from behind the statue of a Viking explorer to scan the immediate crowd. Most people were sitting on the grass, watching with appreciative oohs and aahs as fireworks etched brilliant paths into the equally colorful night sky. Children ran around with the usual array of sparklers, the fireworks spitting glitter as they trailed brief-lived images into the air. The acid smell of the smoke hung heavy around us, slowly dissipated by the breeze blowing in from the water.\n \"I think that\u0027s her over on the other side. She\u0027s been prowling around all night looking for me, no doubt to complain about one thing or another.\"\n \"She didn\u0027t seem too happy about missing the trip out to the ruins,\" I admitted.\n \"Happy?\" Audrey snorted. \"She bitched so much about missing the fireworks, I decided it just wasn\u0027t worth it, and canceled the trip just to suit her. She certainly ought to be happy. Oh, lord, she\u0027s spotted Magda and Ray. They haven\u0027t seen her, poor things, and she\u0027s making a beeline straight for them. I wish I could just refund her money and boot her from the tour, but Patty would have a hissy if I did anything to piss off a client.\"\n I patted Audrey on the arm. \"You have my sympathies, and I wish I could help you with the truculent one, but I\u0027m pretty much Denised out. I think I\u0027ll toddle back to the hotel.\"\n She turned a distraught face to me. \"Oh, Pia, don\u0027t go! The fireworks aren\u0027t over yet, and after that there\u0027s more music. You don\u0027t want to miss your chance at having a romantic encounter with a handsome Viking, now, do you?\"\n I thought of the two men whom I couldn\u0027t quite steel myself up to approach, and gave her a grim little smile. \"I think I\u0027ll pass for tonight. You have fun, though.\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry if Denise has made you feel uncomfortable,\" she said, clearly upset.\n \"Don\u0027t be. It\u0027s not your problem. I\u0027m a big girl and can handle myself, even with Denise. I\u0027m just a bit tired from seeing Reykjavik this morning, and then all the wandering around the town I did this afternoon. Happy Iceland Independence Day!\"\n \"You, too,\" she said, watching me with a rueful look as I made a dash for the exit.\n The town we were staying in wasn\u0027t large, but its city center was filled with narrow little streets that twisted and turned upon themselves. I got lost twice, trying to find my way to the top of the town, and had to backtrack to the still-brightly-lit main square to get my bearings before setting out again on a street I hoped led to the small hotel we called home.\n I\u0027d just left the lights of the square and was making my way down a narrow, dark street that I had a horrible suspicion I\u0027d just been down, when a dark form loomed up out of a doorway, causing me to simultaneously jump and shriek. My jump was to the side, however, not straight up, causing me to crash into the stone wall of the building.\n The man said something in an unfamiliar language while I clutched the heart that seemed to be leaping from my chest. \"Oh dear god, you scared me. You shouldn\u0027t do that to people; you could give them a heart attack.\"\n The shadowy figure was still for a moment, then moved out into the light. \"My apologies, madam,\" he said in a voice heavy with an Icelandic accent. \"I did not see you, either. Here are your things.\"\n \"No harm done,\" I said, scrabbling at my feet for the contents that had spilled out of my purse.\n \"You are a tourist, yes?\" the man asked.\n \"Yes.\" He seemed nice enough, with a freckled face and the same open, cheerful countenance that I was becoming convinced was standard in Iceland. \"Just here for a few days, unfortunately. Oh, thanks.\" I tucked my bag under my arm, taking the books from him.\n He stooped once more and picked up something else at my feet, offering it to me a second before he froze. The light hit his palm, flashing off of something held there.\n I looked in surprise at the object he held: a narrow silk cord from which a stone hung, a small oval stone somewhat milky in color, blue and green flashing from the depths.\n \"Oh, that\u0027s nice,\" I said, taking it to admire it better. \"Is it an opal? It doesn\u0027t look quite like an opal.\"\n \"It is a moonstone,\" the man answered, his voice kind of choked.\n It looked like a bookmark, the kind you slid around the pages and cover of a book, but rather than a charm hanging from the end, as I\u0027d seen before, this one had the moonstone.\n \"It\u0027s very pretty. Did it come from one of my books? I didn\u0027t know it was in there. I\u0027ll have to take it back to the bookseller. He probably didn\u0027t realize this was tucked away inside - \"\n The man suddenly broke into laughter. \"You didn\u0027t tell me who you were,\" he said, chuckling a last couple of chuckles before he took my arm and steered me out of the alley in the opposite direction. \"I thought you were just an ordinary tourist.\"\n \"Um...\" I didn\u0027t quite know what to say to that. It seemed odd to insist that I was, in fact, perfectly ordinary, but I had a suspicion that the nice Icelander thought I was someone else. \"I think maybe there\u0027s some sort of a mistake.\"\n \"No mistake,\" he said, smiling with genuine happiness. \"We\u0027ve been expecting you, you know. The Zenith said you\u0027d arrive today, but we thought you\u0027d be here earlier. I suppose you felt it necessary to maintain your cover as a tourist?\"\n \"OK, now we really are talking at cross-purposes.\" I stopped, not willing to get myself any more lost than I had been. \"My name is Pia Thomason, and I really am just an ordinary tourist.\"\n \"Pia? Heh-heh. You are very good,\" he said admiringly, taking my arm again and gently pushing me forward. \"I am Mattias. I am the sacristan.\"\n \"Sorry?\" I said, unfamiliar with the word. Would it make me a Bad American if I tore my arm from his grip and turned around to run back to the holiday crowds? With everyone down at the waterfront park enjoying the celebrations, the town was all but deserted.\n \"It means - let me see if I can translate it for you - keeper of the doors, yes? You understand?\"\n \"A doorkeeper? Is that some sort of a doorman?\" I asked, puffing a little since Mattias was hauling me gently but persistently up one of the steep stone roads. \"Like at a hotel, you mean?\"\n \"Doorman... that may not be the right word. Doorkeeper sounds better. I am doorkeeper of the Brotherhood of the Blessed Light.\"\n I tried to remember what was the predominant religion of the area, but drew a blank. \"Ah. I assume that\u0027s a religion?\"\n He chuckled again. \"You wish to play? I will play. Yes, it is a religion, a very old one. Its origins are in the Basque region. We were once known as Ilargi, but now we are called by the name of the Brotherhood. We have been around since the beginning of the darkness.\"\n \"Ilargi?\" I asked, startled at the familiar word. I peered up into the face of the man who continued to urge me up the street. \"Isn\u0027t that the name of the woods outside of the town? The place with the ruins?\"\n \"Woods?\" His blond brows pulled together. \"I do not understand. Are you testing me?\"\n I dug my heels in and stopped him a second time. He faced me with a puzzled expression, but I could see no signs of hostility or, worse, madness. He had to have me confused with someone else. \"I\u0027m sorry, Mattias, but I really do think you have the wrong person. I do not understand half of what you are saying.\"\n \"It is I who am sorry. My English is not very good.\"\n \"Your English is better than mine. I meant you\u0027re misinterpreting what I\u0027m saying, and I haven\u0027t a clue about your responses. For example, I don\u0027t know where you\u0027re taking me.\"\n \"Here,\" he said, waving a hand at a building ahead of us. It was a small church made of grey stone that sat at the top of the street.\n I relaxed a smidgen at the sight of it, feeling that Mattias was no threat despite his confusion. \"Is that your church?\"\n \"Yes. We will go in now.\"\n I hesitated, trying to figure out how to get through to him that I wasn\u0027t the person he thought I was.\n \"It is all right,\" he said, taking my hand and tugging me up the steps to the church door. \"I am the sacristan. I am the sun.\"\n \"The son of who?\" I asked, eyeing the church carefully. It looked perfectly normal, not at all out of the ordinary.\n \"Not \u0027who\u0027... the sun. You know, the sun in the sky?\" he said, pointing upward.\n \"Oh, the sun. You... er... you think you\u0027re the sun?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n I switched my examination from the church to the man who was leading me into it. He still looked sane, but if he thought he was the sun, perhaps it would be wiser to let him think I was going along with his claims until I could slip away.\n The church did much to reassure my nerves. It, too, looked perfectly ordinary, and was pretty much as I had expected from my visits to other ancient Icelandic churches - a small anteroom that opened out into the main part of the church, narrow aisles running down the middle and on either side of two banks of pews. At the far end stood the altar. It wasn\u0027t until I was halfway down the aisle that I realized that something was wrong. The church was decorated with the usual crosses and symbols of Christianity, but over these had been thrown small black cloths embroidered with silver crescent moons.\n \"Uh-oh,\" I said, squirming out of Mattias\u0027s grip. Had I stumbled onto some strange cult? Were there strange cults in Iceland? I had thought they were pagans before Christianity swept through Scandinavia - perhaps this was a pagan cult? \"I think this is far enough.\"\n \"Mattias?\" A woman called out from the other end of the church, emerging from a room behind the altar. She was middle-aged, with salt-and-pepper hair, and eyes that practically snapped as she bustled down the aisle toward us. She continued in what I assumed was Icelandic.\n \"Kristjana, I bring the Zorya,\" Mattias interrupted her. \"She is English.\"\n \"American, actually, although my name isn\u0027t Zorya. It\u0027s Pia, and I\u0027m really terribly sorry to intrude, but I think Mattias has me mixed up with someone else,\" I explained to the woman. She looked perfectly normal, perfectly sane and unremarkable, kind of a plump grandmotherly figure. All but her eyes, that is.\n Those intense dark eyes examined me for a moment before she asked Mattias a question.\n \"I am sure,\" he answered. \"She bears the stone.\"\n \"You mean this?\" I asked, holding up the silk bookmark.\n Kristjana\u0027s eyes widened for a moment, then she nodded. \"You are very welcome to our sanctuary, Zorya.\"\n \"Ahh, a light begins to dawn,\" I said slowly as my mental fog cleared. \"It\u0027s this, isn\u0027t it?\" I waved the bookmark around. The moonstone at the end of it glowed gently in the dim interior of the church. \"That\u0027s where all the confusion comes from. I\u0027m happy to tell you that this isn\u0027t mine.\"\n \"No, it isn\u0027t, it belongs to no one, but you are its keeper now, and you must guard it well. We have much work for you to do,\" Kristjana said primly. She gestured toward the back of the church. \"You will come now and we prepare for the first ceremony. We were told you would be arriving earlier.\"\n I glanced as casually as I could manage around the church. Relief filled me at the sight of the half-open front door. With an expression I hoped bore no indication of my intentions, I shuffled backward a few steps. \"This is really a lovely church. I like the moons, they\u0027re pretty as well. Is that something your group worships?\"\n Mattias frowned a little as Kristjana watched me, her face expressionless. I hoped neither of them noticed I was still moving backward, toward the door, in tiny little baby steps.\n \"The Brotherhood are children of the moon, although we do not worship it,\" she said carefully. \"We are of the light. We spread the light. It is through the light that we cleanse the world.\"\n Hairs on my arms started to prickle at her words. I had no doubt now that I had somehow managed to get myself mistaken for someone expected by this odd pagan cult. They didn\u0027t look dangerous, but I felt it was wiser to make as few waves as possible before I dashed for freedom. \"You spread light? You mean you do good works?\"\n \"Through us, the light cleanses darkness from the world,\" she answered, her voice almost singsong, as if she was speaking a catechism. \"Through us, the light purges evil.\"\n \"We definitely need less evil in the world,\" I agreed, and shuffled a few feet closer to the door. If either of them had noticed that the distance between us was growing, they didn\u0027t comment on it.\n \"The Midnight Zorya focuses the light, using the power on behalf of us all.\"\n \"You said that word before,\" I said, slapping a pleasantly curious look on my face. I took another two steps backward, reaching out with a hand behind me to feel for the door. I was still too far away to touch it. \"What exactly is a Zorya?\"\n Kristjana didn\u0027t even blink. Mattias shot me a puzzled glance before turning his gaze on his companion.\n \"There are three Zoryas who rule the skies - morning, evening, and midnight. Auroras, they are called by the Westerners, but the Brotherhood call them by their true names.\"\n \"Auroras. That\u0027s really interesting.\" This had to be some sort of a pagan cult. Who else would worship the northern lights and the moon?\n \"Tradition says that the sun dies in the Midnight Zorya\u0027s arms each night, and is reborn each morning. That is why you must wed tonight.\"\n \"Whoa!\" I said, stumbling to a stop. \"Wed? Excuse me?\"\n \"You must wed the sacristan, the sun,\" the woman said. She nodded toward Mattias. \"The Zorya has little power until she has taken a husband and been recognized by the Brotherhood.\"\n \"Wed as in marry?\" I asked, wondering if perhaps their English was not as good as I had assumed.\n \"Yes, marry. Zoryas are always wed. It is the way.\"\n A horrible suspicion dawned that both relieved and annoyed me. \"This is part of the tour, isn\u0027t it? You\u0027re not some wacky cult after all - you\u0027re just doing a lot of hand waving and mystical mumbo jumbo to distract my attention away from the fact that this is a blind date, right?\"\n \"The Brotherhood are earnest in their intent to cleanse the world of evil,\" Kristjana said, an annoyed look flitting across her face.\n \"I can see you are.\" I crossed my arms over my chest, my relief that they weren\u0027t wackos mingling with my own irritation. However much trouble they went to, I wasn\u0027t inclined to go along with their silly production. \"You can tell Audrey from me that I don\u0027t find it very entertaining. I may be on a singles\u0027 tour, but I\u0027m not so desperate I\u0027m willing to do some sort of role-playing thing, no matter how handsome the participant is.\"\n Mattias\u0027s frown cleared. He smiled. \"You are plump, but I like that. We will be good together sexually.\"\n \"Uh-huh,\" I said, unsure of whether I should be offended or amused by the scenario. At least I didn\u0027t have to worry that they were strange cultists who would perform who knew what sorts of acts upon my person.\n \"I am a very fine lover,\" he continued, obviously feeling it was a point he needed to drive home. So to speak.\n \"Well, I\u0027m flattered and all, but as I said, I\u0027m not really that... er... desperate. Not that I\u0027d have to be desperate to want to hook up with you, Mattias, but I\u0027m sure you know what I mean.\"\n \"No, I don\u0027t think I do,\" he said, the frown having returned.\n I ignored that, smiling brightly and taking a couple more steps backward. \"Well, this has been fun, but I think I\u0027m going to get going. I\u0027ll be sure to tell Audrey just how good you guys were, though. And thanks for the plump-but-still-attractive comment. It\u0027s always nice to know that there are men out there who like women who aren\u0027t walking advertisements for anorexia. Night!\"\n Identical startled expressions manifested on their faces as I turned and walked out the door. Either they had believed their acting was enough to suck me in or, what was more likely, Audrey told them I\u0027d be an easy mark, lonely enough that I\u0027d agree to just about anything in order to have a date with a handsome man.\n What stung was just how close to the truth that was. \"After all, you\u0027re on a tour meant to pair people up. You can\u0027t get much more desperate than that,\" I told myself. My conversation was short-lived when I heard my name being called behind me.\n Mattias stood at the door of the church. The older woman shoved him out of the way, pointed at me, and snapped out an order. He looked surprised for a moment, but ran down the steps with a set look on his face that triggered a sudden spurt of adrenaline.\n What if they weren\u0027t set up by Audrey? What if they were, in actuality, a creepy cult that seriously believed I was going to marry a complete stranger simply because my book had an odd bookmark?\n \"Oh, crap,\" I swore, telling my brain to stop thinking and start making my legs move. I bolted down the street, spinning around a corner into a darker street, hoping to lose Mattias despite the fact that he was much more fit than me, not to mention probably quite familiar with the town.\n I dashed around tidy trash cans, emerging into a lit street, screaming at the sudden noise of an approaching car slamming on its brakes and squealing to a stop a few feet away. I didn\u0027t wait to apologize, just gathered my tattered wits and sped across the remainder of the street and into a twisty narrow passage that ran between two tall stone buildings.\n A man\u0027s voice called out behind me. Damn that long-legged Mattias. I was already out of breath and had a suspicious pain in my side that warned of a stitch.\n \"Please let me get away, please let me get away,\" I chanted in time to my pounding footsteps as I ran blindly through the still empty town, my brain squirreling around frantically for some way to escape Mattias. I had to double back somehow. That would surely throw him.\n As I emerged from behind a different church, I spied a narrow set of stairs that led down to a small landing beneath the entrance. I flung myself down it and hunkered beneath the cement bridge that spanned the area, my back plastered against the cold stone. I covered my mouth to silence the sounds of labored breathing.\n A few seconds later, a shadow flashed on the ground next to me, paused for a moment, then flickered past me toward the main square. I counted to ten, holding my breath, until black spots threatened to dance before my eyes. Cautiously I crawled out of my hiding spot and peered over the edge of the railing toward the street, my lungs wheezily drawing in much-needed oxygen.\n People were starting to appear from the direction of the park, some heading for cars, others going to the central square, where sounds of a band warming up could be heard. \"The fireworks must be over,\" I mused aloud, \"which means if I stay put, there will be a lot of people I can use as cover. That sounds smart.\"\n \"Excuse me, could you help us?\"\n At the soft voice behind me, I whirled around, clutching at the railing as my heart just about jumped out of my chest for the second time in an hour. \"Holy cheese and crackers! You almost scared... me... to... uh...\"\n The two people who stood before me, at first glance, were nothing to make a mature, reasonably intelligent woman turn into a babbling fool, but that\u0027s just what happened. The man and woman were clearly a couple, because the woman, petite, with big, soulful eyes, clung to the man\u0027s arm as she peered up at me from under the low brim of a hat I vaguely remembered was called a cloche. She was wearing a low-waisted dress, while he was in an old-fashioned-looking suit and a fedora. But what had me stammering to a startled stop was the fact that the two of them were translucent, almost transparent, an odd bluish sort of glow about them as if they were made up of the ghostly images sometimes seen on old TVs.\n The word \"ghost\" reverberated around in my head with growing intensity.\n \"We\u0027re lost. Can you help us?\" the woman said, glancing up at her man.\n \"Uh.\" Hesitantly, I held out my hand, the hairs on my arm standing on end as my fingers reached the man\u0027s arm and passed right through it with only a tiny tingle.\n \"We were on a ship,\" the man said, looking around him. \"We were going to Canada. But now we\u0027re lost, and we don\u0027t know where we\u0027re supposed to be going. You are the one who is supposed to help us, aren\u0027t you?\" the man asked, a doubtful look on his translucent face.\n \"You\u0027re... not real,\" I said slowly, trying to understand what was going on. \"Are you?\"\n \"I am Karl. This is my wife, Marta. We were on a ship,\" the ghostly man said again. \"What happened to it?\"\n \"Karl, I\u0027m afraid,\" the woman whimpered, pressing herself closer to her husband. \"Maybe she is the other one.\"\n I blinked in dumb astonishment. \"I\u0027m Pia, and frankly, I\u0027m a bit confused.\"\n \"There\u0027s nothing to be afraid of,\" Karl told his wife, obviously trying to appear brave for her benefit. His expression continued to indicate that he was anything but calmly confident. \"You are the reaper, aren\u0027t you? The old woman said there would be someone in town to show us the way. She said we\u0027d know you by the light you carry.\" He gestured toward my hand.\n I looked down in even more astonishment. The stone-bedecked bookmark that I\u0027d looped around my wrist while I made my escape from Mattias had somehow morphed into a small lantern shaped like a crescent moon. It dangled like a charm from my wrist, and from it, a gentle glow illuminated the area immediately around me. \"All right. This is going way beyond weird or possibly a mental condition, into the land of... well, I don\u0027t know quite what land it is. Maybe the unbelievable? Regardless, I\u0027m not quite sure what to tell you. I don\u0027t think I\u0027m the grim reaper - at least no one has informed me of anything like that,\" I said with a forced little laugh that sounded hollow.\n \"She doesn\u0027t seem to be anxious to help us,\" Marta said, a sob in her voice. \"What are we going to do? What if the evil one comes?\"\n As if on cue, Mattias appeared briefly at the end of the street. I ducked down until I could just barely see him. He stood for a moment in indecision, quickly scanning the front of the church and the street before he made a right turn and hurried off down a cross street.\n \"I\u0027m sorry, I don\u0027t quite understand what it is you want me to do for you. You say an old lady told you to find me? Did she say her name?\" I asked, wondering if the woman at the church could have sent the pair after me.\n \"She was on the ship. She said she would stay there, where her son was, but that we should go ashore and the reaper would show us the way. She said we\u0027d know you by your light, and that there might be another one, an evil one, who did not have a light. You do have a light,\" Karl pointed out.\n \"Yeah, and I\u0027m not quite sure how that happened, but given the present situation, I think maybe I\u0027ll just move past that point. Where exactly did you need directions to? I\u0027m a stranger here, myself, and don\u0027t know too many of the local spots, although I do have a good map.\"\n The couple squatted down next to me as I pulled out the detailed map I had for the area.\n \"We were going to Canada. To Halifax, to be with Marta\u0027s brother and his family,\" Karl said as they peered at my map.\n I glanced at their period clothing, and bit my lower lip for a moment. \"Would you mind me asking you when you were on the ship? What... er... what year was it?\"\n \"It was 1922,\" Karl answered quickly, looking puzzled. \"Why?\"\n I reached out to touch the lapel of his coat. Just as before, my hand met no resistance and passed right through him. \"I hate to tell you this, but I don\u0027t think your ship made it to Canada. I have a suspicion that it might have wrecked offshore of Iceland, and you\u0027re... well, you\u0027re ghosts.\"\n \"Karl,\" Marta said in a near wail, grabbing her husband\u0027s arm again. \"She is not the good one. She is Ilargi!\"\n \"Shhh!\" I hissed, peeping over the edge of the railing to see if Mattias had come back. The street, luckily, was clear. \"I\u0027m not anything other than really confused.\"\n \"Now, love, don\u0027t panic,\" Karl said, patting her hand. \"She is a reaper, not Ilargi. We just need to convince her we\u0027re worthy of her help.\"\n \"Oh, you don\u0027t have to convince me of that. I can see you\u0027re a very nice couple, and I\u0027m really sorry to have to be the one to break it to you that you\u0027re... er... life challenged. And I would help you if I could, but I really don\u0027t think I\u0027m the person you\u0027re looking for.\"\n \"You\u0027re not going to show us the way?\" Karl asked with a nervous glance at his wife.\n Marta stared at me with bleak, hopeless dark eyes that seemed to wring my heart. \"You would not leave us to the other?\"\n \"I\u0027m not sure who you\u0027re talking about, but I\u0027ll tell you what I\u0027ll do - you explain to me exactly where it is you\u0027re trying to get to, and I\u0027ll find out how you get there, OK?\"\n \"But... you know where we\u0027re going,\" Marta said, her eyes moving between her husband and me. She looked strained, somehow stretched, as if she was about to tear apart into a thousand wispy bits.\n \"All right, then, I\u0027ll find out where you\u0027re going, and then we\u0027ll work on how to get you there,\" I said, trying to sound confident and calm. \"Have you two been wandering around the town the whole time?\"\n They both stared silently at me.\n \"Let me put it this way - what\u0027s the last thing you remember?\" I asked.\n \"We were on the ship,\" Karl said.\n \"Yes, I got that part. But what happened to the ship?\"\n The pair glanced at each other.\n \"I don\u0027t understand,\" Karl said. \"We were on the ship. The old lady said to look for you, and we found you.\"\n Clearly the trauma of their deaths had left them drifting, both figuratively and literally, and they didn\u0027t remember the transition between life and the afterlife.\n I made a little face to myself at how quickly I\u0027d become accustomed to the idea of ghosts and an afterlife, but I had to admit, the evidence was even now staring hopefully at me. \"OK. We\u0027ll just let that go. While I\u0027m looking, why don\u0027t you two go down to the caf¨¦ on the main square. I\u0027ll meet you there when I find out where it is you\u0027re supposed to go.\"\n \"Caf¨¦?\" Marta asked.\n I gave them directions on where to find it, and reiterated that I would meet them there. \"I\u0027ve got a few things to take care of first,\" I said, straightening slowly as I verified that the street was clear of Mattias. \"But just as soon as I can, I\u0027ll try to find someone who knows what\u0027s going on. Sound good?\"\n \"And if the other should come, the Ilargi?\" Karl asked, clearly worried. \"He will steal our souls!\"\n \"That\u0027s not good.\" I made a little face as I thought. \"Um... run away?\"\n That evidently satisfied them, because they nodded and thanked me, drifting off down the street until they disappeared into the night. I noted with interest that the second they disappeared from my view, the glowing silver moon dangling from my wrist changed back into a moonstone hanging on a silk cord.\n \"Too strange,\" I told the bookmark. \"But right at this moment, I\u0027m not going to try to figure you out. I\u0027ve got to get myself out of this predicament with Mattias, and much as I\u0027d like to hunker down, staying in one spot might be asking for trouble if he comes back to look closely at the church. Better get a move on, now, Pia.\"\n There\u0027s really no use talking to yourself if you\u0027re not going to listen to your own advice, so I did as I was told, and crawled up the narrow stairs to the street, glancing around quickly to make sure the woman in charge of the cult hadn\u0027t been following us, before heading off in the direction opposite the one Mattias had taken.\n The threat of a stitch in my side blossomed to full life a couple of blocks later, leaving me clutching my side and limping (for some reason, limping made me feel better). Holding the paperback books and my bag made it difficult to try to ease the pain in my side, so I dumped the books into the nearest trash can, hesitating for a moment over the pretty moonstone bookmark. Part of me wanted to dump it, as well, and wash my hands of anything to do with crazy moonstone cults, frightened ghosts, and lusty Icelanders, but the moral part of my brain pointed out that it wasn\u0027t really mine to throw away, and the least I could do was try to find its rightful owner. It was entirely within reason that whoever it belonged to could help Karl and Marta.\n \"Maybe the bookseller will know,\" I murmured as I reclaimed the bookmark from the top of the trash, but as I did so, a cold chill ran down my back.\n The top book was, as I had told the Frenchwoman who had plowed into me earlier, a mystery, but beneath it lay the Regency romance I\u0027d snatched up. I hadn\u0027t really looked at the cover, since I had a love of Regencies, but I saw now that the two people gracing the cover were depicted dancing. \"Dancers on the cover... oh, no. Now what am I going to do?\"\n I grabbed the book and stuffed it into my bag, wondering if there was any chance I\u0027d find the woman in the holiday crowd.\n \"What a mess,\" I murmured, and with a hand pressed to my side, I limped my way down the street toward the waterfront. Perhaps I would get a glimpse of the woman if she was still looking for bookstores.\n I had just made it across the park when Mattias popped up out of nowhere. He didn\u0027t see me, but I knew that, exposed as I was, he soon would. I had to get away, but he was in a position that allowed him to look down the three streets that met at the park. I whirled around, scanning for anywhere I could hide, my gaze sharpening on a dark curve at the far edge of the park, where it butted up against a cliff. People were still streaming out of the park, but couples were using the darkness along the tree-lined end to engage in a little romantic snogging.\n I hunched over and tried to use people to shield me as I made my way to the trees, intending to hide behind one of them until Mattias left. But as I glanced over my shoulder toward him, he was looking in my direction; he started forward hesitantly, as if he wasn\u0027t sure he had seen me.\n \"Dammit,\" I muttered, excusing myself when the couple nearest me broke off what was surely a marathon lip-lock session to glare at my interruption. \"Sorry. Go on with what you were doing.\"\n The woman snorted and, grabbing her partner by the hand, dragged him off. Just beyond them, Mattias was heading straight in my direction.\n Another couple left the security of the shadows, giggling and laughing about something as they passed. A shadow separated from the wall behind them, a male shadow who appeared to be alone.\n \"Pia?\" I heard Mattias call as he approached.\n \"This is so clich¨¦ I can\u0027t believe it, but desperate times and all that,\" I muttered to myself as I gathered up my mental strength and stopped the man who was walking past me. \"I sure hope you speak English, and I really hope you don\u0027t take this the wrong way, but here goes.\"\n At my touch, the man stopped, turning toward me, his face deep in shadow. Eyes the shade of blue known as teal, like a Siamese cat\u0027s, seemed to glow at me. I prayed I wasn\u0027t about to get tossed in jail for assault, grabbed his other arm, and more or less flung myself on him, chickening out at the last second and kissing the very edge of his cheek where it met the corner of his mouth.\n \"Please don\u0027t yell or anything like that,\" I murmured against his skin, my lips tingling at the sensation of soft stubble.\n \"Yar!\" a man said next to my ear.\n I jumped and stared with shock at the face that appeared just behind the man. Like Karl and Marta, he was nearly translucent.\n \"I likes a bit o\u0027 the cash, meself, but ye\u0027re missin\u0027 the dock there, lass,\" the ghost said. \"Yer aim\u0027s off.\"\n The victim of my pathetic but desperate plan stiffened in my arms but didn\u0027t shove me away or yell or even try to kiss me back (more\u0027s the pity - I\u0027ve always been a sucker for blue eyes). He did, however, look a bit taken aback at what was surely an expression of utter and complete befuddlement visible on my face.\n Mattias loomed up in my view, but he couldn\u0027t reach me, blocked as he was by the people between us. \"Pia?\"\n I slunk down a few inches lower, shifting my grip on the man I held so that my fingers clutched soft, curly hair. I threw in a rapturous moan as I kept my lips glued to his cheek, my attention moving him, to Mattias, to the ghost who continued to leer at me.\n Mattias peered at us for a moment, then gave a little shake of his head and moved off. At that moment, hands that felt like they were made of steel grabbed my wrists and pushed me backward.\n \"I appreciate the offer, but I am not interested,\" the man said, his voice deep and lyrical, with an Italian accent that seemed to skitter over my skin like electricity.\n \"I am,\" the ghost said, winking. \"You can snog me any day.\"\n \"Um,\" I said, not sure how to respond to a lecherous ghost. \"Are you a sailor, by any chance?\"\n \"No,\" the blue-eyed man said, frowning.\n \"I\u0027m sorry, I wasn\u0027t asking you; I was asking him,\" I said, nodding toward the ghost.\n The man looked behind him, then narrowed his eyes at me. \"Are you drunk?\"\n \"Not in the least, although I\u0027m really wishing I was at this point. You don\u0027t see him?\"\n \"See who?\" he asked.\n \"The ghost. I think he\u0027s a sailor from a ship that went down in 1922.\"\n \"The Rebecca,\" the ghost said, nodding. \"Went down in a bank o\u0027 fog the likes o\u0027 which I\u0027d ne\u0027er seen afore, and hope to ne\u0027er again.\"\n \"There is no one there,\" Blue Eyes said slowly.\n \"You\u0027re bein\u0027 the reaper, then?\" the sailor asked. He was a short man, somewhat squat, with a face that looked like it had been in more than one bar fight.\n \"I\u0027m sorry, but I\u0027m not. I just have this,\" I told the ghost, holding up my wrist to show him the moonstone, which had once again changed into a tiny crescent moon lantern. \"But if you go to the caf¨¦ on the square, you\u0027ll find a couple of other people who were on the ship, and who are waiting for the person in question.\"\n \"What are you talking about?\" asked the man.\n \"Caf¨¦, you say?\" the ghost said, looking hopeful. \"Ye be thinkin\u0027 they\u0027ll have a tot o\u0027 rum there?\"\n \"They might. You never know.\"\n \"Aye, that ye don\u0027t. I\u0027ll be on me way, then.\" He gave me a gap-toothed grin. \"Ye might want to be practicin\u0027 yer aim while I\u0027m gone. Looks like yer fella doesn\u0027t appreciate ye kissin\u0027 naught but his cheek.\"\n I said nothing, not wanting the man whom I\u0027d jumped on to think I was any crazier than he already did. Obviously the moonstone/lantern contained some sort of magic that allowed only its bearer to see ghosts.\n \"I\u0027m so sorry; you must think I\u0027m the worst sort of woman,\" I told Blue Eyes. \"But there was a man chasing me, and I really didn\u0027t want him to find me.\"\n He had continued to hold my wrist bearing the moonstone. While it was a lantern, he didn\u0027t glance at it, but the second the ghost left, it reverted to the stone, and he clutched my hand even tighter.\n To my surprise, rather than release me, he took a few steps into a bluish white pool of light cast by a portable lantern. I gawked when the light revealed him to be one of the two eye-candy twins, the one with short hair. The light hit him only on one side, but the planes of his face were hard and angled, a cleft cutting deep into his chin, his nose narrow, but not straight, as if it had been broken and not set properly. And then there were those lovely eyes, shining from within, beautiful pure teal blue with little spiky black bits that seemed to seep from his pupils. Oh, yes, they were gorgeous eyes... and they were focused on me with a look that had my color rising.\n \"I know it sounds crazy,\" I stammered, \"but it\u0027s true. There really was someone behind you, only you couldn\u0027t see him and I could. I think it\u0027s because of the moonstone, but that\u0027s really neither here nor there. But I\u0027ve bothered you enough for one night, and clearly you feel the need to go get checked for scabies or something. I mean, I would if some strange guy suddenly swooped down and started kissing me. Not that I have scabies, you understand. I\u0027m perfectly scabies free. In fact, I\u0027m not quite sure what scabies is, although I know if you\u0027re not careful you can get it from sexual partners. Oh, lord. I\u0027m babbling. I\u0027m sorry. I do that when I\u0027m nervous, or embarrassed, and wow, am I embarrassed now.\"\n The man stared at me like I had just turned into a tap-dancing llama, complete with top hat and cane.\n \"Sorry,\" I said again, making a little gesture of vague apology.\n His eyes narrowed as he looked again at my hand.\n \"I\u0027ll just go now,\" I finished lamely, jerking my hand from his and scurrying away toward the street, my face hot with embarrassment. \"What on earth is wrong with you, Pia? You babbled at that poor man, positively babbled like a deranged person. Dear god, I can\u0027t take you anywhere, can I?\"\n A sleek red car purred up to the curb.\n \"I bet I\u0027m even redder,\" I muttered to myself as I hurried by the car. \"I should just go home. I can\u0027t get any lower than thieeeeeeeeee!\"\n Before I could pass by completely, one of the doors opened and I was shoved from behind. I grabbed at the roof to keep from falling into it, but another shove at my back more or less folded me in half, resulting in me collapsing inside the vehicle. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/zen-and-the-art-of-vampires-dark-ones-6/page-2.html","bookId":2207,"book":{"id":2207,"title":"Zen and the Art of Vampires (Dark Ones #6)","description":"Storyline: \n Zen and the Art of Vampires (Dark Ones #6) \n White picket fences can be dangerous to vampires.
