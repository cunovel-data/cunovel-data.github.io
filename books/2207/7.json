Are you all right?\"\\n\\n I looked up from where I\u0027d been hunkered over, sobbing into my knees, right into the nostrils of a ghostly horse. I fought back the startled scream that threatened to burst out of me, sniffling instead and hunting desperately in my pockets for a tissue. \"Ulfur?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, it\u0027s me.\" His horse smelled my hair, then snorted into it with a shake of his head. \"Ragnar, leave her be. She does not wish to pet you.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think I could if I wanted to,\" I said, giving up the search and dabbing at my damp nose with my sleeve. I pushed away the trash cans that hid me and got to my feet, a little wobbly, but not entirely surprised to find that the space behind the library where I\u0027d collapsed was now filled with ghostly entities. \"Oh, good, you found Karl and Marta.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, they were hiding near the park. There was another man, a sailor, I think, but he said he was going to search for rum and would find us later. You are hurt?\" Ulfur\u0027s face was filled with concern, as were, in varying degrees, those of the other ghosts crowded around me. All except the smart-mouthed teen, and she was busy picking her nails until the woman I assumed was her mother cuffed her upside the head. \"Did your husband harm you?\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s not my husband,\" I said, dusting off my clothing. \"Well, that\u0027s to say, he might be, but if he is, he\u0027s neither legal nor wanted.\"\\n\\n \"You kissed him,\" one of the male ghosts said.\\n\\n \"That was... um... unintentional,\" I lied.\\n\\n \"It looked like you were enjoying it,\" Ulfur pointed out.\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t say it was unpleasant, just that it was unintentional.\" I don\u0027t know why I felt quite so defensive about the kiss Kristoff and I had shared, unless it was over the immense guilt I felt at betraying his friend. \"He\u0027s not really my husband. I may be married to him, but he\u0027s not a husband in the true sense of the word.\"\\n\\n \"Ah,\" the older ghost said, waggling his eyebrows at the teen\u0027s mom. \"He hasn\u0027t bedded her yet.\"\\n\\n A chorus of comprehending aahs followed that statement.\\n\\n \"You\u0027d best be seeing to that right away,\" snarky teen\u0027s mom said with a knowing look. \"Men like that have an appetite for women, and you\u0027ll not be wanting him to stray.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not trying to keep him,\" I told her, waving my hands around vaguely as if that would help explain the situation. \"He\u0027s not really mine.\"\\n\\n \"Not yet, but just you bed him a few times, and he\u0027ll be yours for life,\" an elderly, creaking voice said. There was a flurry of movement behind the ghosts, and a tiny, incredibly old woman appeared. \"I\u0027ve had five husbands, I have, and if there\u0027s anyone who knows how to keep a man, it\u0027s me.\"\\n\\n Everyone nodded their heads, the teen\u0027s mom saying, \"Aye, Old Agda knows. You listen to her, reaper.\"\\n\\n \"Five husbands?\" I couldn\u0027t help but ask.\\n\\n \"They all died young, all but the last one, and he were thirty year younger\u0027n me. Died happy they did, too.\" She cackled, elbowing the mom beside her. Mom smiled indulgently.\\n\\n I gave myself a mental shake. I needed to make plans, and standing around here talking about Kristoff and husbands was not going to help matters. \"Well, that\u0027s nice, but - \"\\n\\n \"I like the young ones,\" another woman called out from the back, a woman around whom three children were clustered, clutching her long skirts. \"They\u0027ve got stamina. Maybe our reaper ought to look for someone a bit younger.\"\\n\\n \"Bah,\" the first woman said. \"What good is stamina if they don\u0027t know what to do with it? It\u0027s all about what god gifted them with, if you want my opinion.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t need anyone with more stamina,\" I protested. \"Besides, Kristoff is a vampire and is who knows how many hundreds of years old. Just about anyone is going to be younger than him.\"\\n\\n \"The younger ones lack experience,\" the teen\u0027s mom argued with the size-matters woman. \"And it doesn\u0027t matter how long a man\u0027s member is if he hasn\u0027t the experience to use it properly. The young ones don\u0027t know how to please a woman, and the ones without experience just leave you wishing they\u0027d be done so you can bring in the wash and tend to supper. Now, the reaper\u0027s man, he looks like he knows what he\u0027s about.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll say he does,\" her daughter purred.\\n\\n I narrowed a look on her that by rights should have turned her to stone before realizing what I was doing. I was not jealous of Kristoff! I did not want him! It was Alec I was interested in. Alec who smiled, and was happy to turn off the lights, and left me with a dead body... oy.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s all women\u0027s talk,\" the middle-aged ghost interrupted. \"What our reaper wants is someone who can protect her. The true measure of a man is how he provides for his family.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re just saying that because you\u0027d just built Ingveldur a new cabin,\" one of the other men called out. \"Two rooms! Who has need of a separate sleeping room, I ask you? That\u0027s just flaunting your wealth in the face of god, that is.\"\\n\\n \"Ha! Thus speaks the man with three - three - milk cows, when one would do. If you want to talk about setting yourself above the rest of the village, Hallur Hallsson, then you\u0027d best look to yourself first.\"\\n\\n \"I needed those cows,\" the man named Hallur yelled, storming forward to confront his neighbor. \"I had six children to feed! Unlike Agda and her hundred chickens. All those chickens for just one old woman. Bah! That was flaunting wealth if there ever was flaunting.\"\\n\\n The elderly lady shot him a nasty glare. \"I\u0027d quite a few less chickens than when I started out, and I know just whose pot they ended up in, don\u0027t I?\"\\n\\n An argument broke out amongst the ghosts about the merits of one-room versus two-room housing, cows, chickens, and, inexplicably, a pig named Freyja. I was about to yell for attention when timid little Marta came forward and put a ghostly hand on my arm, making my skin tingle a little where she touched me.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t listen to them,\" she said softly, a little smile on her lips as she glanced at Karl. \"I\u0027ve been married a whole year, and what they\u0027re saying isn\u0027t that important. None of it really matters so long as you are fond of your husband.\"\\n\\n \"But I\u0027m not,\" I told her, wishing like the dickens that someone, anyone, would just listen to me without forming their own assumptions. \"I don\u0027t even like him. He murdered a man in cold blood, right in front of me.\"\\n\\n \"He was defending you,\" Karl said, raising his voice a little as the argument continued behind him. \"He saved your life.\"\\n\\n \"Possibly, but we don\u0027t know that. The man who grabbed me could have killed me easily if he wanted to, but he didn\u0027t. He was simply using me as a shield to protect himself from Kristoff. Oh, it doesn\u0027t matter,\" I said, rubbing my temples. A headache had come in the aftermath of my tears, leaving my head pounding. \"None of this really matters. What I have to do is decide what steps to take to get myself and all of you to safety. People. People!\"\\n\\n The arguing stopped as I yelled and banged the lid of a garbage can.\\n\\n \"... told you that pig was barren, but would you listen to me? No, you wouldn\u0027t; you just had to... oh.\" The man who bore a strong resemblance to Ulfur stopped arguing and turned to look at me. \"Sorry.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you.\" I eyed them all carefully for a few seconds. \"Before we proceed, I\u0027d like to know if any of you have any idea whatsoever of the whereabouts of this Ostri place I\u0027m supposed to take you. Anyone?\"\\n\\n Fifteen blank faces regarded me.\\n\\n \"Hmm.\" I bit my lip and tried to think through the dull waves of pain that ebbed and flowed against my brain like molasses. \"Kristoff said the Brotherhood will kill me, so I can\u0027t go to them. Anniki is dead, and I don\u0027t know any other Zoryas, assuming there are others to know, so I can\u0027t ask one of them where you\u0027re supposed to be taken. If I was home, I could look it up online and see if there\u0027s some clue as to where Ostri is located, but Kristoff has my passport. And besides, Audrey has all our tickets. I don\u0027t even have any money.\"\\n\\n At that, my stomach rumbled, and I realized it had been at least twelve hours since I\u0027d last eaten.\\n\\n \"Oh, man,\" I said, wrapping my arms around myself. \"No money means no food, or a way out of here, or even a place to stay. I\u0027ve got to get some money.\"\\n\\n Ulfur pursed his lips and looked thoughtful. \"I\u0027d give you my coins, but they washed out to sea with the rest of the village.\"\\n\\n I shook my head, thinking over my options. Wire home for money? That would probably require identification to pick up the funds, and my wallet had no doubt been confiscated. Steal it?\\n\\n \"Does anyone here have any thieving experience?\" I asked my little gaggle of ghosts.\\n\\n \"Aye, Hallur does,\" the old lady named Agda called out. \"He can take a chicken out of its nest without ruffling a feather.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s a lie!\" he yelled, rounding on her.\\n\\n \"Anyone else?\" I interrupted before they got started.\\n\\n Everyone shook their heads. \"Great. Me, either. I wouldn\u0027t know how to go about stealing money in this day and age of high-tech security.\" I chewed on my lip a bit more.\\n\\n \"Can you borrow some coins from a friend?\" Ulfur asked, stroking Ragnar\u0027s head.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t have any friends here - \" I started to say, then remembered Magda. She wasn\u0027t a friend per se, but she was very friendly, and seemed an understanding sort of woman. The question was, would she help me, or turn me over to the police?\\n\\n I shook my head at the notion of trusting my life to someone I didn\u0027t really know. Magda may seem like a nice person, but what proof did I have that I could trust her in a time of need?\\n\\n I\u0027d just have to find someone else.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s your husband,\" Marta said. \"You could ask him for money.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll ask Magda,\" I told the ghosts, coming to a snap decision. \"But I can\u0027t go traipsing around with you all on my heels. We\u0027d better find somewhere to park you that you\u0027ll be safe from the soul-sucking Ilargi person.\"\\n\\n I contemplated trying to make my way around town without being spotted by police, fellow tour members, Kristoff, or the Brotherhood folk, but a few moments\u0027 consideration left me shrugging at the building in front of me. Why not? I hustled my little group into the library and told them to vanish. The library was due to close almost immediately thereafter, but with a cunning that was heretofore unknown to me, I managed to hide myself beneath a stack of beanbag chairs in the children\u0027s area, and remain there until the building was closed.\\n\\n I lay there for another two hours while the employees puttered around, alternately listening to my stomach growl, dozing, and wondering what the hell I was going to do if Magda wouldn\u0027t help me.\\n\\n An idea started to form. It wasn\u0027t anything I was proud of, and it definitely went against my better judgment, but if push came to shove, there might be a way out of the situation. I felt a little bit better when, two hours later, I crawled out from my beanbag cocoon and rallied my troops.\\n\\n \"Right, I\u0027m going to go see my friend and pray she won\u0027t turn me over to the police. You guys stay here. If this bad reaper is human, like I am, he shouldn\u0027t be able to get in to the building to get you guys.\" I glanced around the darkened library, only a couple of security lights illuminating the interior. \"I sure wish ghosts could read books and use the computer terminals. A little research into reapers and Ostri might be very helpful.\"\\n\\n Karl looked from his wife to me. \"But we can read books. I don\u0027t know about this computer terminal you mentioned, but I can read.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure you can, but what I meant was more I wish you guys had the ability to interact with physical things.\"\\n\\n \"We can,\" Ulfur said. Ragnar nodded his head and snorted before munching the fabric of the nearest bean-bag chair.\\n\\n \"Really?\" I reached out to touch him, my hand passing right through his arm. \"Um...\"\\n\\n Ulfur smiled and the air around him shimmered. His body slowly solidified, going from its bluish translucent state to that of a solid form.\\n\\n \"Holy Jehoshaphat,\" I said, reaching out with a tentative fingertip. It met solid cloth. \"I didn\u0027t know you could do that!\"\\n\\n \"We can\u0027t for very long. It takes a lot of energy to have a physical presence, but it if will help you, we can try looking for some information.\"\\n\\n \"That would be immensely helpful,\" I said, relieved. \"I don\u0027t suppose any of you can operate a computer?\"\\n\\n I wasn\u0027t surprised when no one offered to use the nearby computer. I suspected that drifting around aimlessly for a hundred years or more didn\u0027t lend itself to techno-savvy.\\n\\n \"Oh, all right, I\u0027ll do it,\" the snarky teen said when her mother, the woman named Ingveldur, gave her a non-too-gentle shove forward.\\n\\n \"You know about computers?\" I asked the girl dubiously.\\n\\n She tched and plunked herself down in that boneless way teen girls have. \"I\u0027m not stupid, you know. People do come to the village with laptops and mobile phones and Game Boys. What am I looking for?\"\\n\\n \"Does that computer have Internet access?\" I asked peering over her shoulder. She solidified and tapped on the keyboard. \"Oh, excellent. Google Ostri, would you? And maybe reapers. And the Brotherhood of the Blessed Light. And while you\u0027re at it - \"\\n\\n She gave me a look that told me I was trying her nerves.\\n\\n \"Just Google whatever you can and print out anything that looks important. Will the rest of you be all right?\"\\n\\n My words were spoken to an empty room. Ulfur and Karl had taken charge of the villagers and spread them out to search the library for any books that might help.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll be back as soon as I can,\" I told Marta as she came with me to the window. It didn\u0027t show any signs of being wired for an alarm, which I took as an indication of the low crime rate of this area. \"Close the window after me, and don\u0027t let anyone in who isn\u0027t me. OK?\"\\n\\n \"All right. But, Pia, the old sailor is still out there,\" she said worriedly.\\n\\n \"If I see him, I\u0027ll send him this way. Don\u0027t look so glum,\" I said, swinging my legs out the window and jumping down to the well-tended flower bed below. \"I think our luck is about to change.\"\\n\\n That seemed to pacify her. She smiled and waved as I glanced down the street, muttering softly to myself, \"And I just pray it\u0027s not going from bad to worse.\"\\n\\n Dalkafjordhur at night was surprisingly busy. I didn\u0027t know if it was the white-night phenomenon of twenty-four hours of sunlight, or if the town was just like that normally, but there were a lot of people out. Luckily, I knew where I would find the tour group - we were supposed to be attending a reenactment group\u0027s dinner in a Viking longhouse, complete with Old Norse poetry readings, and scenes enacted from historical sagas of the period.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t have any trouble finding the fake longhouse, since it was a popular tourist site located near the park. I didn\u0027t even have any problem slipping in the back way, through what I assumed was the employees\u0027 entrance. But as I peeked out from behind a curtain marking the stage, I faced nothing but trouble. The longhouse center was taken up with long tables, at which my tour mates sat stuffing their faces with delicious-smelling salmon, fresh bread, and at least a half dozen other dishes.\\n\\n My stomach growled with increasing loudness.\\n\\n I ducked into a small room at the sound of voices coming out of the area I figured was the kitchen, a slow smile emerging as I eyed the various bits of Viking period costume.\\n\\n \"Well, you\u0027re not going to fool anyone knowledgeable,\" I told my reflection a short while later as I examined the ensemble I\u0027d cobbled together from bits and pieces of costumes that would fit my abundant self. \"But with the lights out, and everyone focused on the stage, you may get by with it.\"\\n\\n I grabbed a wig of long black hair and clapped it onto my head, gave the wraparound linen apron dress that I\u0027d pulled over my own gauze sundress a tug to hide as much of the modern flowery print beneath as possible, and grabbed a box filled with small bottles of water, hefting it to my shoulder to hide my face.\\n\\n When I emerged from the back depths, the stage show was just starting, and the lights, as I had surmised, were lowered to highlight the actors. I scurried around the back of the tour group, pulling the long black hair around my face as I sidled forward with a murmur of \"Water?\" to the nearest members.\\n\\n No one sent me a second glance. Denise sat tapping with irritated fingers on the table, looking sourly at the actors as they demonstrated a Viking ritual. Audrey was next to her looking tired and miserable. I had a pang of remorse for that, feeling certain she\u0027d been through hell after I had run off.\\n\\n Magda was at the far end with Ray. I hunched over and offered water to him first, then to her.\\n\\n \"Water?\"\\n\\n \"No, thank you,\" Magda said without looking.\\n\\n \"I think you are going to want some,\" I said softly, leaning a bit closer to her while keeping an eye on everyone else.\\n\\n \"No, thanks,\" she repeated, still not looking at me.\\n\\n I sighed to myself and nudged her on the back with the box. \"Water is good for you. Take some.\"\\n\\n She turned around with a slight frown, her eyes growing huge when I pulled the hair away from my face enough so she could see who I was.\\n\\n \"Take the water,\" I said softly, braced for flight. If she shouted and screamed, I\u0027d throw the bottles at everyone and make a fast retreat back to the safety of the library.\\n\\n She did neither, however, simply took the bottle of water I held out and watched me with huge eyes.\\n\\n \"The bathroom is in the back. You may need it after drinking all that,\" I said softly, with a meaning I was sure was clear.\\n\\n She nodded and I slipped backward, into the shadows of the room, quietly making my way out to the rear rooms.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t have long to wait. Magda entered the bathroom with a backward glance, carefully closing the door before turning on me. \"Pia, what on earth is going on? What are you doing in that atrocious black wig? Why is Denise saying you murdered someone? And why were the police questioning everyone about you and a man you were with last night?\"\\n\\n I blinked at that last bit, irrationally focusing on the least important thing. \"They know I was with a man last night? Who said so?\"\\n\\n \"Who do you think? Miss Nosy-Pants Denise, that\u0027s who. She said she saw a man stealing away from your room in the early hours of the morning.\"\\n\\n \"Just what was she doing hanging around my room watching for men?\" I asked, suddenly outraged at the invasion of my privacy.\\n\\n Magda crossed her arms. \"There\u0027s a dead woman in your bathroom, and all you can do is get pissed at Denise\u0027s nosiness? What happened. Pia? I don\u0027t believe for one minute that you killed the woman, like Denise said. You\u0027re not a murderer. You don\u0027t have that sort of an aura.\"\\n\\n I slumped against the sink in relief, pulling off the itchy black wig, ruffling my hand through my hair to fluff it back up. \"Oh, thank god. You don\u0027t know how many horrible things I envisioned you saying to me. No, I didn\u0027t murder her, although I do know who she is, and I have a suspicion - \" I bit off what I was going to say, not wanting to put my worst thoughts into words.\\n\\n \"You have a suspicion you know who it was?\"\\n\\n I nodded.\\n\\n Magda came over to me and put a hand on mine. \"Pia, sweetie, who was that man you were with? Do you think it was him?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" I said miserably, wanting nothing more than to pour the whole story out to her, but knowing she wouldn\u0027t believe half of it. \"His name is Alec, and it\u0027s possible he killed her, although he didn\u0027t seem at all like the violent sort of person.\"\\n\\n Not until I knew he was a vampire, that is. Not until I learned how much the vampires hated the Brotherhood, and then it made all too much sense.\\n\\n \"Then again, Kristoff said he didn\u0027t kill her, but can I really trust him now? I just don\u0027t know!\"\\n\\n \"Who\u0027s Kristoff?\" Magda asked.\\n\\n \"Another guy. Alec\u0027s friend.\"\\n\\n \"You haven\u0027t gone to the police? I really think you should. If that guy you hooked up with is bad news, you don\u0027t know what he will do next. He might come after you.\"\\n\\n I shook my head. \"I wish I could, but it\u0027s... complicated.\"\\n\\n \"Complicated how? Pia, are you in love with this Alec? Because if you are, I\u0027m here to tell you - \"\\n\\n \"No, no, it\u0027s nothing like that,\" I said, blushing at the memory of the kiss I had shared with Kristoff. \"He\u0027s a nice enough man, and I really don\u0027t think he murdered Anniki, although he might have... Oh, it\u0027s so muddled, Magda. There are other people involved, a religious group, for lack of a better description, and Kristoff said he didn\u0027t, but what if he was lying? But if he did, how could I want to kiss him? I mean, wouldn\u0027t you know if someone was capable of murdering someone else?\"\\n\\n She blinked at me in incomprehension. \"Just by kissing him? I don\u0027t know. I haven\u0027t kissed any murderers. Wait a minute - you kissed your lover\u0027s friend? Oh, honey, we really need to have a talk.\"\\n\\n \"No, it\u0027s not like that. At least... No, it\u0027s not. I\u0027m married to him, but I don\u0027t like him.\"\\n\\n Her mouth dropped open a little bit. \"Whoa, back up a few steps. You\u0027re married? Since when?\"\\n\\n \"This morning. I was forced into it. Kristoff bribed some people and had his friends witness it falsely. But I don\u0027t like him at all. He murdered a man in front of me, for heaven\u0027s sake!\"\\n\\n \"Another murder?\" she asked, incredulous.\\n\\n \"Yes, although Karl says that Kristoff was just trying to protect me from him.\"\\n\\n \"Who\u0027s Karl?\" she asked, a puzzled frown wrinkling her forehead. \"A third lover?\"\\n\\n \"No, he has a wife,\" I said, not wanting to get into the issue of just exactly what he was. \"And Kristoff isn\u0027t a lover. He\u0027s just my husband, that\u0027s all.\"\\n\\n \"Then, who did this unwanted husband kill?\"\\n\\n \"The man with the knife.\" I ran my hands through my hair again. \"I told you it was complicated.\"\\n\\n \"Honey, that\u0027s not even close to the word I\u0027d use for it.\"\\n\\n There was a knock at the door and an inquiry.\\n\\n \"Occupied! Be out in just a minute!\" Magda shouted at it, then turned back to me. \"What can I do to help?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, god love you,\" I said, filled with appreciation. I gave her a swift hug. \"Bless you for not pestering me with a thousand and one questions. I need money, mostly. I don\u0027t have anywhere to stay and haven\u0027t eaten since yesterday - \"\\n\\n \"Say no more,\" she said, digging out a money belt. She handed me a handful of cash. \"I\u0027m afraid that\u0027s all I have. I was going to cash a traveler\u0027s check in the morning. Is that enough?\"\\n\\n I counted it quickly. It was about a hundred dollars in euros. \"It\u0027s more than enough,\" I lied. \"Thank you so much.\"\\n\\n \"Husbands and lovers and Karls with their wives aside, I think you really should go to the police,\" she counseled. \"If people are being murdered in front of you, you have to do something about it. You can\u0027t just run away.\"\\n\\n \"I am going to do something,\" I said, mentally girding my loins. \"I\u0027m going to go to the only person who can help me.\"\\n\\n \"Karl?\" Magda guessed. \"Alec?\"\\n\\n \"No. Kristjana.\"\\n\\n \"Is she a lover, too?\" she asked hesitantly.\\n\\n I smiled. \"No, she\u0027s a woman who runs the religious cult I mentioned earlier. Kristoff said she\u0027d try to kill me, but I think I know a way around that.\"\\n\\n She opened her mouth to say something, but pounding on the door halted her.\\n\\n \"Magda? Are you in there?\"\\n\\n \"Denise!\" Magda hissed.\\n\\n I spun around in the tiny bathroom. It consisted of a sink, toilet, and mirror, with a tiny window that would be impossible for more than one of my legs to fit through. \"Crap! I have to hide!\"\\n\\n \"Here. Put this on and hide your face,\" Magda said, shoving the wig at me before turning to bellow at the door. \"Just a second! Give a girl a chance, for cripe\u0027s sake.\"\\n\\n \"Are you all right?\" Denise called, her voice filled with suspicion. \"Who are you talking to?\"\\n\\n \"I popped my zipper, if you must know, and this lady is helping me get decent.\"\\n\\n I hurriedly stuffed my hair back under the wig and draped the long tresses around my face.\\n\\n \"You ready?\" Magda asked, her hand on the door lock.\\n\\n I nodded and dipped my head.\\n\\n Magda unlocked the door and shoved her way out, pushing herself directly in front of Denise, acting as a human screen for me. \"Just the person I need. I think I have something in my eye. Do you see anything?\"\\n\\n Through the wall of hair hanging over my face, I could see Denise trying to get a look at me over Magda\u0027s shoulder, but the latter adroitly stepped to the side and blocked her view. I hurried into the little room I\u0027d used before, counting to twenty before poking my head out. I just caught the sight of Magda whisking Denise back into the main room. I sent her another mental thanks and shucked my flimsy outfit.\\n\\n Someone spoke as I left the room.\\n\\n \"What? Sorry? I\u0027m... a bit light-headed. Do you speak English?\"\\n\\n The man, who wore a reproduction Viking outfit of leather and wool, carrying a huge tub of ice cream, nodded. \"English, yes. You sick?\"\\n\\n \"Just need a breath of fresh air. Is that the way out? Great. I\u0027ll just get a little air and then get back to the show. It\u0027s great so far,\" I said as I hurried out the door to freedom.\\n\\n I was about a block away when I was grabbed from behind.\\n\\n \"Gotcha!\" Magda said, laughing when I clutched my chest. I seemed to be doing a lot of that lately.\\n\\n \"What are you doing here?\" I asked, looking around for anyone else.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m coming with you.
