Indeed, labouring as I have been for many months past, under an almost total deprivation of sight, (the effect of exposure and anxiety of mind in the prosecution of geographical researches,) I owe it to the casual assistance of some of my friends, that I am at length enabled to lay these results before your Lordship and the public. \\n\\n \\n\\n While I feel a painful conviction that many errors must necessarily pervade a work produced under such unfavourable circumstances, it affords me no small consolation to reflect that Your Lordship has been aware of my situation, and will be disposed to grant me every reasonable indulgence. \\n\\n \\n\\n I have the honor to be, \\n\\n With the highest respect, \\n\\n My Lord, \\n\\n Your Lordship’s \\n\\n Very obedient and humble servant, \\n\\n CHARLES STURT \\n\\n London June, 1833. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2004/57226.html","bookId":660,"book":{"id":660,"title":"Two expeditions into the interior of southern Australia","description":"简介： The completion of this Work affords me the opportunity I have long desired of thanking your Lordship thus publicly, for the kindness with which you acceded to my request to be permitted to dedicate it to you....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2004","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:07 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:07 AM"}}
