{"id":25780,"no":15,"title":"CHAPTER XV. MR WHITTLESTAFF GOES OUT TO DINNER.","content":"This would be her last opportunity. So Mary told herself as she got out of the carriage at Mr Hall\u0027s front door. It was made manifest to her by such a speech that he did not expect that she should do so, but looked upon her doing so as within the verge of possibility. She could still do it, and yet not encounter his disgust or his horror. How terrible was the importance to herself, and, as she believed, to the other man also. Was she not justified in so thinking? Mr Gordon had come home, travelling a great distance, at much risk to his property, at great loss of time, through infinite trouble and danger, merely to ask her to be his wife. Had a letter reached her from him but a week ago bidding her to come, would she not have gone through all the danger and all the trouble? How willingly would she have gone! It was the one thing that she desired; and, as far as she could understand the signs which he had given, it was the one, one thing which he desired. He had made his appeal to that other man, and, as far as she could understand the signs which had reached her, had been referred with confidence to her decision. Now she was told that the chance of changing her mind was still in her power. \\n\\n \\n\\n The matter was one of terrible importance; but was its importance to Mr Whittlestaff as great as to John Gordon? She put herself altogether out of the question. She acknowledged to herself, with a false humility, that she was nobody;—she was a poor woman living on charity, and was not to be thought of when the position of these two men was taken into consideration. It chanced that they both wanted her. Which wanted the most? Which of the two would want her for the longest? To which would her services be of the greater avail in assisting him to his happiness. Could there be a doubt? Was it not in human nature that she should bind herself to the younger man, and with him go through the world, whether safely or in danger? \\n\\n \\n\\n But though she had had time to allow these questions to pass through her mind between the utterance of Mr Whittlestaff\u0027s words and her entrance into Mr Hall\u0027s drawing-room, she did not in truth doubt. She knew that she had made up her mind on the matter. Mr Gordon would in all probability have no opportunity of saying another word to her. But let him say what word he might, it should be in vain. Nothing that he could say, nothing that she could say, would avail anything. If this other man would release her,—then indeed she would be released. But there was no chance of such release coming. In truth, Mary did not know how near the chance was to her;—or rather, how near the chance had been. He had now positively made up his mind, and would say not a word further unless she asked him. If Mary said nothing to John Gordon on this evening, he would take an opportunity before they left the house to inform Mr Hall of his intended marriage. When once the word should have passed his mouth, he could not live under the stigma of a second Catherine Bailey. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Miss Lawrie, pray let me make you known to my intended.\" This came from Mr Montagu Blake, who felt himself to be justified by his peculiar circumstances in so far taking upon himself the work of introducing the guests in Mr Hall\u0027s house. \"Of course, you\u0027ve heard all about it. I am the happiest young man in Hampshire,—and she is the next.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Speak for yourself, Montagu. I am not a young man at all.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027re a young man\u0027s darling, which is the next thing to it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How are you, Whittlestaff?\" said Mr Hall. \"Wonderful weather, isn\u0027t it? I\u0027m told that you\u0027ve been in trouble about that drunken husband which plagues the life out of that respectable housekeeper of yours.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He is a trouble; but if he is bad to me, how much worse must he be to her?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s true. He must be very bad, I should think. Miss Mary, why don\u0027t you come over this fine weather, and have tea with my girls and Kattie Forrester in the woods? You should take your chance while you have a young man willing to wait upon you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I shall be quite delighted,\" said Blake, \"and so will John Gordon.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Only that I shall be in London this time to-morrow,\" said Gordon. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s nonsense. You are not going to Kimberley all at once. The young ladies expect you to bring out a lot of diamonds and show them before you start. Have you seen his diamonds, Miss Lawrie?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Indeed no,\" said Mary. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think I should have asked just to see them,\" said Evelina Hall. Why should they join her name with his in this uncivil manner, or suppose that she had any special power to induce him to show his treasures. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"When you first find a diamond,\" said Mr Hall, \"what do you do with it? Do you ring a bell and call together your friends, and begin to rejoice.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, indeed. The diamond is generally washed out of the mud by some nigger, and we have to look very sharp after him to see that he doesn\u0027t hide it under his toe-nails. It\u0027s not a very romantic kind of business from first to last.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Only profitable,\" said the curate. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s as may be. It is subject to greater losses than the preaching of sermons.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I should like to go out and see it all,\" said Miss Hall, looking into Miss Lawrie\u0027s face. This also appeared to Mary to be ill-natured. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then the butler announced the dinner, and they all followed Mr Hall and the curate\u0027s bride out of one room into the other. \"This young lady,\" said he, \"is supposed to be in the ascendant just at the present moment. She can\u0027t be married above two or three times at the most. I say this to excuse myself to Miss Lawrie, who ought perhaps to have the post of honour.\" To this some joking reply was made, and they all sat down to their dinner. Miss Lawrie was at Mr Hall\u0027s left hand, and at her left hand John Gordon was seated. Mary could perceive that everything was arranged so as to throw herself and John Gordon together,—as though they had some special interest in each other. Of all this Mr Whittlestaff saw nothing. But John Gordon did perceive something, and told himself that that ass Blake had been at work. But his perceptions in the matter were not half as sharp as those of Mary Lawrie. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I used to be very fond of your father, Gordon,\" said Mr Hall, when the dinner was half over. \"It\u0027s all done and gone now. Dear, dear, dear!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He was an unfortunate man, and perhaps expected too much from his friends.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am very glad to see his son here, at any rate. I wish you were not going to settle down so far away from us.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Kimberley is a long way off.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, indeed; and when a fellow gets out there he is apt to stay, I suppose.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I shall do so, probably. I have nobody near enough to me here at home to make it likely that I shall come back.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You have uncles and aunts?\" said Mr Hall. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"One uncle and two aunts. I shall suit their views and my cousins\u0027 better by sending home some diamonds than by coming myself.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How long will that take?\" asked Mr Hall. The conversation was kept up solely between Mr Hall and John Gordon. Mr Whittlestaff took no share in it unless when he was asked a question, and the four girls kept up a whisper with Miss Forrester and Montagu Blake. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have a share in rather a good thing,\" said Gordon; \"and if I could get out of it so as to realise my property, I think that six months might suffice.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, dear! Then we may have you back again before the year\u0027s out?\" Mr Whittlestaff looked up at this, as though apprised that the danger was not yet over. But he reflected that before twelve months were gone he would certainly have made Mary Lawrie his wife. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Kimberley is not a very alluring place,\" said John Gordon. \"I don\u0027t know any spot on God\u0027s earth that I should be less likely to choose as my abiding resting-place.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Except for the diamonds.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Except for the diamonds, as you remark. And therefore when a man has got his fill of diamonds, he is likely to leave.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"His fill of diamonds!\" said Augusta Hall. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Shouldn\u0027t you like to try your fill of diamonds?\" asked Blake. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not at all,\" said Evelina. \"I\u0027d rather have strawberries and cream.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think I should like diamonds best,\" said Mary. Whereupon Evelina suggested that her younger sister was a greedy little creature. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"As soon as you\u0027ve got your fill of diamonds, which won\u0027t take more than six months longer,\" suggested Mr Hall, \"you\u0027ll come back again?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not exactly. I have an idea of going up the country across the Zambesi. I\u0027ve a notion that I should like to make my way out somewhere in the Mediterranean,—Egypt, for instance, or Algiers.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What!—across the equator? You\u0027d never do that alive?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Things of that kind have been done. Stanley crossed the continent.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But not from south to north. I don\u0027t believe in that. You had better remain at Kimberley and get more diamonds.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He\u0027d be with diamonds like the boy with the bacon,\" said the clergyman; \"when prepared for another wish, he\u0027d have more than he could eat.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"To tell the truth,\" said John Gordon, \"I don\u0027t quite know what I should do. It would depend perhaps on what somebody else would join me in doing. My life was very lonely at Kimberley, and I do not love being alone.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then, why don\u0027t you take a wife?\" said Montagu Blake, very loudly, as though he had hit the target right in the bull\u0027s-eye. He so spoke as to bring the conversation to an abrupt end. Mr Whittlestaff immediately looked conscious. He was a man who, on such an occasion, could not look otherwise than conscious. And the five girls, with all of whom the question of the loves of John Gordon and Mary Lawrie had been fully discussed, looked conscious. Mary Lawrie was painfully conscious; but endeavoured to hide it, not unsuccessfully. But in her endeavour she had to look unnaturally stern,—and was conscious, too, that she did that. Mr Hall, whose feelings of romance were not perhaps of the highest order, looked round on Mr Whittlestaff and Mary Lawrie. Montagu Blake felt that he had achieved a triumph. \"Yes,\" said he, \"if those are your feelings, why don\u0027t you take a wife?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"One man may not be so happy as another,\" said Gordon, laughing. \"You have suited yourself admirably, and seem to think it quite easy for a man to make a selection.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not quite such a selection as mine, perhaps,\" said Blake. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then think of the difficulty. Do you suppose that any second Miss Forrester would dream of going to the diamond-fields with me?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Perhaps not,\" said Blake. \"Not a second Miss Forrester—but somebody else.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Something inferior?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well—yes; inferior to my Miss Forrester, certainly.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You are the most conceited young man that I ever came across,\" said the young lady herself. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And I am not inclined to put up with anything that is very inferior,\" said John Gordon. He could not help his eye from glancing for a moment round upon Mary Lawrie. She was aware of it, though no one else noticed it in the room. She was aware of it, though any one watching her would have said that she had never looked at him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A man may always find a woman to suit him, if he looks well about him,\" said Mr Hall, sententiously. \"Don\u0027t you think so, Whittlestaff?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I dare say he may,\" said Mr Whittlestaff, very flatly. And as he said so he made up his mind that he would, for that day, postpone the task of telling Mr Hall of his intended marriage. \\n\\n \\n\\n The evening passed by, and the time came for Mr Whittlestaff to drive Miss Lawrie back to Croker\u0027s Hall. She had certainly spent a most uneventful period, as far as action or even words of her own was concerned. But the afternoon was one which she would never forget. She had been quite, quite sure, when she came into the house; but she was more than sure now. At every word that had been spoken she had thought of herself and of him. Would he not have known how to have chosen a fit companion,—only for this great misfortune? And would she have been so much inferior to Miss Forrester? Would he have thought her inferior to any one? Would he not have preferred her to any other female whom the world had at the present moment produced? Oh, the pity of it; the pity of it! \\n\\n \\n\\n Then came the bidding of adieu. Gordon was to sleep at Little Alresford that night, and to take his departure by early train on the next morning. Of the adieux spoken the next morning we need take no notice, but only of the word or two uttered that night. \"Good-bye, Mr Gordon,\" said Mr Whittlestaff, having taken courage for the occasion, and having thought even of the necessary syllables to be spoken. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Good-bye, Mr Whittlestaff,\" and he gave his rival his hand in apparently friendly grasp. To those burning questions he had asked he had received no word of reply; but they were questions which he would not repeat again. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Good-bye, Mr Gordon,\" said Mary. She had thought of the moment much, but had determined at last that she would trust herself to nothing further. He took her hand, but did not say a word. He took it and pressed it for a moment, and then turned his face away, and went in from the hall back to the door leading to the drawing-room. Mr Whittlestaff was at the moment putting on his great-coat, and Mary stood with her bonnet and cloak on at the open front door, listening to a word or two from Kattie Forrester and Evelina Hall. \"Oh, I wish, I wish it might have been!\" said Kattie Forrester. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And so do I,\" said Evelina. \"Can\u0027t it be?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Good-night,\" said Mary, boldly, stepping out rapidly into the moonlight, and mounting without assistance to her place in the open carriage. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I beg your pardon,\" said Mr Hall, following her; but there came not a word from her. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr Whittlestaff had gone back after John Gordon. \"By-the-by,\" he said, \"what will be your address in London?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The \u0027Oxford and Cambridge\u0027 in Pall Mall,\" said he. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, yes; the club there. It might be that I should have a word to send to you. But I don\u0027t suppose I shall,\" he added, as he turned round to go away. Then he shook hands with the party in the hall, and mounting up into the carriage, drove Mary and himself away homewards towards Croker\u0027s Hall. \\n\\n \\n\\n Not a word was spoken between them for the first mile, nor did a sound of a sob or an audible suspicion of a tear come from Mary. Why did those girls know the secret of her heart in that way? Why had they dared to express a hope as to an event, or an idea as to a disappointment, all knowledge of which ought to be buried in her own bosom? Had she spoken of her love for John Gordon? She was sure that no word had escaped her. And were it surmised, was it not customary that such surmises should be kept in the dark? But here these young ladies had dared to pity her for her vain love, as though, like some village maiden, she had gone about in tears bewailing herself that some groom or gardener had been faithless. But sitting thus for the first mile, she choked herself to keep down her sobs. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mary,\" at last he whispered to her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, Mr Whittlestaff?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mary, we are both of us unhappy.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am not unhappy,\" she said, plucking up herself suddenly. \"Why do you say that I am unhappy?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You seem so. I at any rate am unhappy.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What makes you so?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I did wrong to take you to dine in company with that man.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It was not for me to refuse to go.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No; there is no blame to you in it;—nor is there blame to me. But it would have been better for us both had we remained away.\" Then he drove on in silence, and did not speak another word till they reached home. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well!\" said Mrs Baggett, following them into the dining-room. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What do you mean by \u0027well\u0027?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What did the folks say to you at Mr Hall\u0027s? I can see by your face that some of them have been saying summat.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nobody has been saying anything that I know of,\" said Mr Whittlestaff. \"Do you go to bed.\" Then when Mrs Baggett was gone, and Mary had listlessly seated herself on a chair, her lover again addressed her. \"I wish I knew what there is in your heart.\" Yet she would not tell him; but turned away her face and sat silent. \"Have you nothing to say to me?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What should I have to say to you? I have nothing to say of that of which you are thinking.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He has gone now, Mary.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes; he has gone.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And you are contented?\" It did seem hard upon her that she should be called upon to tell a lie,—to say that which he must know to be a lie,—and to do so in order that he might be encouraged to persevere in achieving his own object. But she did not quite understand him. \"Are you contented?\" he repeated again. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then she thought that she would tell the lie. If it was well that she should make the sacrifice for his sake, why should it not be completed? If she had to give herself to him, why should not the gift be as satisfactory as it might be made to his feelings? \"Yes; I am contented.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And you do not wish to see him again?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Certainly not, as your wife.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You do not wish it at all,\" he rejoined, \"whether you be my wife or otherwise?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think you press me too hard.\" Then she remembered herself, and the perfect sacrifice which she was minded to make. \"No; I do not wish again to see Mr Gordon at all. Now, if you will allow me, I will go to bed. I am thoroughly tired out, and I hardly know what I am saying.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes; you can go to bed,\" he said. Then she gave him her hand in silence, and went off to her own room. \\n\\n \\n\\n She had no sooner reached her bed, than she threw herself on it and burst into tears. All this which she had to endure,—all that she would have to bear,—would be, she thought, too much for her. And there came upon her a feeling of contempt for his cruelty. Had he sternly resolved to keep her to her promised word, and to forbid her all happiness for the future,—to make her his wife, let her heart be as it might;—had he said: \"you have come to my house, and have eaten my bread and have drunk of my cup, and have then promised to become my wife, and now you shall not depart from it because this interloper has come between us;\"—then, though she might have felt him to be cruel, still she would have respected him. He would have done, as she believed, as other men do. But he wished to gain his object, and yet not appear to be cruel. It was so that she thought of him. \"And it shall be as he would have it,\" she said to herself. But though she saw far into his character, she did not quite read it aright. \\n\\n \\n\\n He remained there alone in his library into the late hours of the night. But he did not even take up a book with the idea of solacing his hours. He too had his idea of self-sacrifice, which went quite as far as hers. But yet he was not as sure as was she that the self-sacrifice would be a duty. He did not believe, as did she, in the character of John Gordon. What if he should give her up to one who did not deserve her,—to one whose future would not be stable enough to secure the happiness and welfare of such a woman as was Mary Lawrie! He had no knowledge to guide him, nor had she;—nor, for the matter of that, had John Gordon himself any knowledge of what his own future might be. Of his own future Mr Whittlestaff could speak and think with the greatest confidence. It would be safe, happy, and bright, should Mary Lawrie become his wife. Should she not do so, it must be altogether ruined and confounded. \\n\\n \\n\\n He could not conceive it to be possible that he should be required by duty to make such a sacrifice; but he knew of himself that if her happiness, her true and permanent happiness, would require it, then the sacrifice should be made. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2727/75121.html","bookId":1404,"book":{"id":1404,"title":"An Old Man\u0027s Love","description":"简介： Mr William Whittlestaff was strolling very slowly up and down the long walk at his country seat in Hampshire, thinking of the contents of a letter which he held crushed up within his trousers\u0027 pocket.
