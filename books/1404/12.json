{"id":25777,"no":12,"title":"CHAPTER XII. MR BLAKE\u0027S GOOD NEWS.","content":"In the afternoon, after lunch had been eaten, there came a ring at the back-door, and Mr Montagu Blake was announced. There had been a little contretemps or misadventure. It was Mr Blake\u0027s habit when he called at Croker\u0027s Hall to ride his horse into the yard, there to give him up to Hayonotes, and make his way in by the back entrance. On this occasion Hayonotes had been considerably disturbed in his work, and was discussing the sad condition of Mr Baggett with Thornybush over the gate of the kitchen-garden. Consequently, Mr Blake had taken his own horse into the stable, and as he was about to lead the beast up to the stall, had been stopped and confused by Sergeant Baggett\u0027s protruding wooden leg. \"\u0027Alloa! what\u0027s up now?\" said a voice, addressing Mr Blake from under the straw. \"Do you go down, old chap, and get us three-penn\u0027orth of cream o\u0027 the valley from the Cock.\" Then Mr Blake had been aware that this prior visitor was not in a condition to be of much use to him, and tied up his own horse in another stall. But on entering the house, Mr Blake announced the fact of there being a stranger in the stables, and suggested that the one-legged gentleman had been looking at somebody taking a glass of gin. Then Mrs Baggett burst out into a loud screech of agony. \"The nasty drunken beast! he ought to be locked up into the darkest hole they\u0027ve got in all Alresford.\" \"But who is the gentleman?\" said Mr Blake. \"My husband, sir; I won\u0027t deny him. He is the cross as I have to carry, and precious heavy he is. You must have heard of Sergeant Baggett;—the most drunkenest, beastliest, idlest scoundrel as ever the Queen had in the army, and the most difficultest for a woman to put up with in the way of a husband! Let a woman be ever so decent, he\u0027d drink her gowns and her petticoats, down to her very underclothing. How would you like, sir, to have to take up with such a beast as that, after living all your life as comfortable as any lady in the land? Wouldn\u0027t that be a come-down, Mr Blake? And then to have your box locked up, and be told that the key of your bedroom door is in the master\u0027s pocket.\" Thus Mrs Baggett continued to bewail her destiny. Mr Blake having got rid of the old woman, and bethinking himself of the disagreeable incidents to which a gentleman with a larger establishment than his own might be liable, made his way into the sitting-room, where he found Mary Lawrie alone; and having apologised for the manner of his intrusion, and having said something intended to be jocose as to the legs of the warrior in the stable, at once asked a question as to John Gordon. \"Mr Gordon!\" said Mary. \"He was here this morning with Mr Whittlestaff, but I know nothing of him since.\" \"He hasn\u0027t gone back to London?\" \"I don\u0027t know where he has gone. He slept in Alresford last night, but I know nothing of him since.\" \"He sent his bag by the boy at the inn down to the railway station when he came up here. I found his bag there, but heard nothing of him. They told me at the inn that he was to come up here, and I thought I should either find him here or meet him on the road.\" \"Do you want to find him especially?\" \"Well, yes.\" \"Do you know Mr Gordon?\" \"Well, yes; I do. That is to say, he dined with me last night. We were at Oxford together, and yesterday evening we got talking about our adventures since.\" \"He told you that he had been at the diamond-fields?\" \"Oh, yes; I know all about the diamond-fields. But Mr Hall particularly wants to see him up at the Park.\" (Mr Hall was the squire with four daughters who lived at Little Alresford.) \"Mr Hall says that he knew his father many years ago, and sent me out to look for him. I shall be wretched if he goes away without coming to Little Alresford House. He can\u0027t go back to London before four o\u0027clock, because there is no train. You know nothing about his movements?\" \"Nothing at all. For some years past Mr Gordon has been altogether a stranger to me.\" Mr Blake looked into her face, and was aware that there was something to distress her. He at once gathered from her countenance that Mr Whittlestaff had been like the dog that stuck to his bone, and that John Gordon was like the other dog—the disappointed one—and had been turned out from the neighbourhood of the kennel. \"I should imagine that Mr Gordon has gone away, if not to London, then in some other direction.\" It was clear that the young lady intended him to understand that she could say nothing and knew nothing as to Mr Gordon\u0027s movements. \"I suppose I must go down to the station and leave word for him there,\" said Mr Blake. Miss Lawrie only shook her head. \"Mr Hall will be very sorry to miss him. And then I have some special good news to tell him.\" \"Special good news!\" Could it be that something had happened which would induce Mr Whittlestaff to change his mind. That was the one subject which to her, at the present moment, was capable of meaning specially good tidings. \"Yes, indeed, Miss Lawrie; double good news, I may say. Old Mr Harbottle has gone at last at San Remo.\" Mary did know who Mr Harbottle was,—or had been. Mr Harbottle had been the vicar at Little Alresford, for whose death Mr Blake was waiting, in order that he might enter in together upon the good things of matrimony and the living. He was a man so contented, and talked so frequently of the good things which Fortune was to do for him, that the tidings of his luck had reached even the ears of Mary Lawrie. \"That\u0027s an odd way of putting it, of course,\" continued Mr Blake; \"but then he was quite old and very asthmatic, and couldn\u0027t ever come back again. Of course I\u0027m very sorry for him,—in one way; but then I\u0027m very glad in another. It is a good thing to have the house in my own hands, so as to begin to paint at once, ready for her coming. Her father wouldn\u0027t let her be married till I had got the living, and I think he was right, because I shouldn\u0027t have liked to spend money in painting and such like on an uncertainty. As the old gentleman had to die, why shouldn\u0027t I tell the truth? Of course I am glad, though it does sound so terrible.\" \"But what are the double good news?\" \"Oh, I didn\u0027t tell you. Miss Forrester is to come to the Park. She is not coming because Mr Harbottle is dead. That\u0027s only a coincidence. We are not going to be married quite at once,—straight off the reel, you know. I shall have to go to Winchester for that. But now that old Harbottle has gone, I\u0027ll get the day fixed; you see if I don\u0027t. But I must really be off, Miss Lawrie. Mr Hall will be terribly vexed if I don\u0027t find Gordon, and there\u0027s no knowing where he may go whilst I\u0027m talking here.\" Then he made his adieux, but returned before he had shut the door after him. \"You couldn\u0027t send somebody with me, Miss Lawrie? I shall be afraid of that wooden-legged man in the stables, for fear he should get up and abuse me. He asked me to get him some gin,—which was quite unreasonable.\" But on being assured that he would find the groom about the place, he went out, and the trot of his horse was soon heard upon the road. He did succeed in finding John Gordon, who was listlessly waiting at the Claimant\u0027s Arms for the coming of the four o\u0027clock train which was to take him back to London, on his way, as he told himself, to the diamond-fields. He had thrown all his heart, all the energy of which he was the master, into the manner in which he had pleaded for himself and for Mary with Mr Whittlestaff. But he felt the weakness of his position in that he could not remain present upon the ground and see the working of his words. Having said what he had to say, he could only go; and it was not to be expected that the eloquence of an absent man, of one who had declared that he was about to start for South Africa, should be regarded. He knew that what he had said was true, and that, being true, it ought to prevail; but, having declared it, there was nothing for him to do but to go away. He could not see Mary herself again, nor, if he did so, would she be so likely to yield to him as was Mr Whittlestaff. He could have no further excuse for addressing himself to the girl who was about to become the wife of another man. Therefore he sat restless, idle, and miserable in the little parlour at the Claimant\u0027s Arms, thinking that the long journey which he had made had been taken all in vain, and that there was nothing left for him in the world but to return to Kimberley, and add more diamonds to his stock-in-trade. \"Oh, Gordon!\" said Blake, bursting into the room, \"you\u0027re the very man I want to find. You can\u0027t go back to London to-day.\" \"Can\u0027t I?\" \"Quite out of the question. Mr Hall knew your father intimately when you were only a little chap.\" \"Will that prevent my going back to London?\" \"Certainly it will. He wants to renew the acquaintance. He is a most hospitable, kind-hearted man; and who knows, one of the four daughters might do yet.\" \"Who is Mr Hall?\" No doubt he had heard the name on the previous evening; but Hall is common, and had been forgotten. \"Who is Mr Hall? Why, he is the squire of Little Alresford, and my patron. I forget you haven\u0027t heard that Mr Harbottle is dead at last. Of course I am very sorry for the old gentleman in one sense; but it is such a blessing in another. I\u0027m only just thirty, and it\u0027s a grand thing my tumbling into the living in this way.\" \"I needn\u0027t go back because Mr Harbottle is dead.\" \"But Kattie Forrester is coming to the Park. I told you last night, but I daresay you\u0027ve forgotten it; and I couldn\u0027t tell then that Mr Hall was acquainted with you, or that he would be so anxious to be hospitable. He says that I\u0027m to tell you to take your bag up to the house at once. There never was anything more civil than that. Of course I let him know that we had been at Oxford together. That does go for something.\" \"The university and your society together,\" suggested Gordon. \"Don\u0027t chaff, because I\u0027m in earnest. Kattie Forrester will be in by the very train that was to take you on to London, and I\u0027m to wait and put her into Mr Hall\u0027s carriage. One of the daughters, I don\u0027t doubt, will be there, and you can wait and see her if you like it. If you\u0027ll get your bag ready, the coachman will take it with Kattie\u0027s luggage. There\u0027s the Park carriage coming down the street now. I\u0027ll go out and stop old Steadypace the coachman; only don\u0027t you keep him long, because I shouldn\u0027t like Kattie to find that there was no one to look after her at the station.\" There seemed to be an opening in all this for John Gordon to remain at any rate a day longer in the neighbourhood of Mary Lawrie, and he determined that he would avail himself of the opportunity. He therefore, together with his friend Blake, saw the coachman, and gave instructions as to finding the bag at the station, and prepared himself to walk out to the Park. \"You can go down to the station,\" he said to Blake, \"and can ride back with the carriage.\" \"Of course I shall see you up at the house,\" said Blake. \"Indeed I\u0027ve been asked to stay there whilst Kattie is with them. Nothing can be more hospitable than Mr Hall and his four daughters. I\u0027d give you some advice, only I really don\u0027t know which you\u0027d like the best. There is a sort of similarity about them; but that wears off when you come to know them. I have heard people say that the two eldest are very much alike. If that be so, perhaps you\u0027ll like the third the best. The third is the nicest, as her hair may be a shade darker than the others. I really must be off now, as I wouldn\u0027t for worlds that the train should come in before I\u0027m on the platform.\" With that he went into the yard, and at once trotted off on his cob. Gordon paid his bill, and started on his walk to Little Alresford Park. Looking back into his early memories, he could just remember to have heard his father speak of Mr Hall. But that was all. His father was now dead, and, certainly, he thought, had not mentioned the name for many years. But the invitation was civil, and as he was to remain in the neighbourhood, it might be that he should again have an opportunity of seeing Mary Lawrie or Mr Whittlestaff. He found that Little Alresford Park lay between the town and Mr Blake\u0027s church, so that he was at the gate sooner than he expected. He went in, and having time on his hands, deviated from the road and went up a hill, which was indeed one of the downs, though between the park paling. Here he saw deer feeding, and he came after a while to a beech grove. He had now gone down the hill on the other side, and found himself close to as pretty a labourer\u0027s cottage as he remembered ever to have seen. It was still June, and it was hot, and he had been on his legs nearly the whole morning. Then he began to talk, or rather to think to himself. \"What a happy fellow is that man Montagu Blake! He has every thing,—not that he wants, but that he thinks that he wants. The work of his life is merely play. He is going to marry a wife,—not who is, but whom he thinks to be perfection. He looks as though he were never ill a day in his life. How would he do if he were grubbing for diamonds amidst the mud and dust of Kimberley? Instead of that, he can throw himself down on such a spot as this, and meditate his sermon among the beech-trees.\" Then he began to think whether the sermon could be made to have some flavour of the beech-trees, and how much better in that case it would be, and as he so thought he fell asleep. He had not been asleep very long, perhaps not five minutes, when he became aware in his slumbers that an old man was standing over him. One does thus become conscious of things before the moment of waking has arrived, so positively as to give to the sleeper a false sense of the reality of existence. \"I wonder whether you can be Mr Gordon,\" said the old man. \"But I am,\" said Gordon. \"I wonder how you know me.\" \"Because I expect you.\" There was something very mysterious in this,—which, however, lost all mystery as soon as he was sufficiently awake to think of things. \"You are Mr Blake\u0027s friend.\" \"Yes; I am Mr Blake\u0027s friend.\" \"And I am Mr Hall. I didn\u0027t expect to find you sleeping here in Gar Wood. But when I find a strange gentleman asleep in Gar Wood, I put two and two together, and conclude that you must be Mr Gordon.\" \"It\u0027s the prettiest place in all the world, I think.\" \"Yes; we are rather proud of Gar Wood,—especially when the deer are browsing on the hill-side to the left, as they are now. If you don\u0027t want to go to sleep again, we\u0027ll walk up to the house. There\u0027s the carriage. I can hear the wheels. The girls have gone down to fetch your friend\u0027s bride. Mr Blake is very fond of his bride,—as I dare say you have found out.\" Then, as the two walked together to the house, Mr Hall explained that there had been some little difference in years gone by between old Mr Gordon and himself as to money. \"I was very sorry, but I had to look after myself. You knew nothing about it, I dare say.\" \"I have heard your name—that\u0027s all.\" \"I need not say anything more about it,\" said Mr Hall; \"only when I heard that you were in the country, I was very glad to have the opportunity of seeing you. Blake tells me that you know my friend Whittlestaff.\" \"I did not know him till yesterday morning.\" \"Then you know the young lady there; a charming young lady she is. My girls are extremely fond of Mary Lawrie. I hope we may get them to come over while you are staying here.\" \"I can only remain one night,—or at the most two, Mr Hall.\" \"Pooh, pooh! We have other places in the neighbourhood to show you quite as pretty as Gar Wood. Though that\u0027s a bounce: I don\u0027t think there is any morsel quite so choice as Gar Wood when the deer are there. What an eye you must have, Mr Gordon, to have made it out by yourself at once; but then, after all, it only put you to sleep. I wonder whether the Rookery will put you to sleep. We go in this way, so as to escape the formality of the front door, and I\u0027ll introduce you to my daughters and Miss Forrester.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2727/75118.html","bookId":1404,"book":{"id":1404,"title":"An Old Man\u0027s Love","description":"简介： Mr William Whittlestaff was strolling very slowly up and down the long walk at his country seat in Hampshire, thinking of the contents of a letter which he held crushed up within his trousers\u0027 pocket.
