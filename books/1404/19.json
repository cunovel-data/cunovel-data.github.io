{"id":25784,"no":19,"title":"CHAPTER XIX. MR WHITTLESTAFF\u0027S JOURNEY DISCUSSED.","content":"\"I don\u0027t think that if I were you I would go up to London, Mr Whittlestaff,\" said Mary. This was on the Tuesday morning. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why not?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think I would.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why should you interfere?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I know I ought not to interfere.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think you ought. Especially as I have taken the trouble to conceal what I am going about.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I can guess,\" said Mary. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You ought not to guess in such a matter. You ought not to have it on your mind at all. I told you that I would not tell you. I shall go. That\u0027s all that I have got to say.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The words with which he spoke were ill-natured and savage. The reader will find them to be so, if he thinks of them. They were such that a father would hardly speak, under any circumstances, to a grown-up daughter,—much less that a lover would address to his mistress. And Mary was at present filling both capacities. She had been taken into his house almost as an adopted daughter, and had, since that time, had all the privileges accorded to her. She had now been promoted still higher, and had become his affianced bride. That the man should have turned upon her thus, in answer to her counsel, was savage, or at least ungracious. But at every word her heart became fuller and more full of an affection as for something almost divine. What other man had ever shown such love for any woman? and this love was shown to her,—who was nothing to him,—who ate the bread of charity in his house. And it amounted to this, that he intended to give her up to another man,—he who had given such proof of his love,—he, of whom she knew that this was a question of almost life and death,—because in looking into his face she had met there the truth of his heart! Since that first avowal, made before Gordon had come,—made at a moment when some such avowal from her was necessary,—she had spoken no word as to John Gordon. She had endeavoured to show no sign. She had given herself up to her elder lover, and had endeavoured to have it understood that she had not intended to transfer herself because the other man had come across her path again like a flash of lightning. She had dined in company with her younger lover without exchanging a word with him. She had not allowed her eyes to fall upon him more than she could help, lest some expression of tenderness should be seen there. Not a word of hope had fallen from her lips when they had first met, because she had given herself to another. She was sure of herself in that. No doubt there had come moments in which she had hoped—nay, almost expected—that the elder of the two might give her up; and when she had felt sure that it was not to be so, her very soul had rebelled against him. But as she had taken time to think of it, she had absolved him, and had turned her anger against herself. Whatever he wanted,—that she believed it would be her duty to do for him, as far as its achievement might be in her power. \\n\\n \\n\\n She came round and put her arm upon him, and looked into his face. \"Don\u0027t go to London. I ask you not to go.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why should I not go?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"To oblige me. You pretend to have a secret, and refuse to say why you are going. Of course I know.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have written a letter to say that I am coming.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is still lying on the hall-table down-stairs. It will not go to the post till you have decided.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Who has dared to stop it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have. I have dared to stop it. I shall dare to put it in the fire and burn it. Don\u0027t go! He is entitled to nothing. You are entitled to have,—whatever it is that you may want, though it is but such a trifle.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A trifle, Mary!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes. A woman has a little gleam of prettiness about her,—though here it is but of a common order.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Anything so uncommon I never came near before.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Let that pass; whether common or uncommon, it matters nothing. It is something soft, which will soon pass away, and of itself can do no good. It is contemptible.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You are just Mrs Baggett over again.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Very well; I am quite satisfied. Mrs Baggett is a good woman. She can do something beyond lying on a sofa and reading novels, while her good looks fade away. It is simply because a woman is pretty and weak that she is made so much of, and is encouraged to neglect her duties. By God\u0027s help I will not neglect mine. Do not go to London.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He seemed as though he hesitated as he sat there under the spell of her little hand upon his shoulder. And in truth he did hesitate. Could it not be that he should be allowed to sit there all his days, and have her hand about his neck somewhat after this fashion? Was he bound to give it all up? What was it that ordinary selfishness allowed? What depth of self-indulgence amounted to a wickedness which a man could not permit himself to enjoy without absolutely hating himself? It would be easy in this case to have all that he wanted. He need not send the letter. He need not take this wretched journey to London. Looking forward, as he thought that he could look, judging from the girl\u0027s character, he believed that he would have all that he desired,—all that a gracious God could give him,—if he would make her the recognised partner of his bed and his board. Then would he be proud when men should see what sort of a wife he had got for himself at last in place of Catherine Bailey. And why should she not love him? Did not all her words tend to show that there was love? \\n\\n \\n\\n And then suddenly there came a frown across his face, as she stood looking at him. She was getting to know the manner of that frown. Now she stooped down to kiss it away from his brow. It was a brave thing to do; but she did it with a consciousness of her courage. \"Now I may burn the letter,\" she said, as though she were about to depart upon the errand. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, by heaven!\" he said. \"Let me have a sandwich and a glass of wine, for I shall start in an hour.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n With a glance of his thoughts he had answered all those questions. He had taught himself what ordinary selfishness allowed. Ordinary selfishness,—such selfishness as that of which he would have permitted himself the indulgence,—must have allowed him to disregard the misery of John Gordon, and to keep the girl to himself. As far as John Gordon was concerned, he would not have cared for his sufferings. He was as much to himself,—or more,—than could be John Gordon. He did not love John Gordon, and could have doomed him to tearing his hair,—not without regret, but at any rate without remorse. He had settled that question. But with Mary Lawrie there must be a never-dying pang of self-accusation, were he to take her to his arms while her love was settled elsewhere. It was not that he feared her for himself, but that he feared himself for her sake. God had filled his heart with love of the girl,—and, if it was love, could it be that he would destroy her future for the gratification of his own feelings? \"I tell you it is no good,\" he said, as she crouched down beside him, almost sitting on his knee. \\n\\n \\n\\n At this moment Mrs Baggett came into the room, detecting Mary almost in the embrace of her old master. \"He\u0027s come back again, sir,\" said Mrs Baggett. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Who has come back?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The Sergeant.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then you may tell him to go about his business. He is not wanted, at any rate. You are to remain here, and have your own way, like an old fool.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am that, sir.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There is not any one coming to interfere with you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sir!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Then Mary got up, and stood sobbing at the open window. \"At any rate, you\u0027ll have to remain here to look after the house, even if I go away. Where is the Sergeant?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He\u0027s in the stable again.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What! drunk?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, no; he\u0027s not drunk. I think his wooden leg is affected sooner than if he had two like mine, or yours, sir. And he did manage to go in of his self, now that he knows the way. He\u0027s there among the hay, and I do think it\u0027s very unkind of Hayonotes to say as he\u0027ll spoil it. But how am I to get him out, unless I goes away with him?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Let him stay there and give him some dinner. I don\u0027t know what else you\u0027ve to do.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He can\u0027t stay always,—in course, sir. As Hayonotes says,—what\u0027s he to do with a wooden-legged sergeant in his stable as a permanence? I had come to say I was to go home with him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027re to do nothing of the kind.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What is it you mean, then, about my taking care of the house?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Never you mind. When I want you to know, I shall tell you.\" Then Mrs Baggett bobbed her head three times in the direction of Mary Lawrie\u0027s back, as though to ask some question whether the leaving the house might not be in reference to Mary\u0027s marriage. But she feared that it was not made in reference to Mr Whittlestaff\u0027s marriage also. What had her master meant when he had said that there was no one coming to interfere with her, Mrs Baggett? \"You needn\u0027t ask any questions just at present, Mrs Baggett,\" he said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You don\u0027t mean as you are going up to London just to give her up to that young fellow?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am going about my own business, and I won\u0027t be inquired into,\" said Mr Whittlestaff. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then you\u0027re going to do what no man ought to do.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You are an impertinent old woman,\" said her master. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I daresay I am. All the same, it\u0027s my duty to tell you my mind. You can\u0027t eat me, Mr Whittlestaff, and it wouldn\u0027t much matter if you could. When you\u0027ve said that you\u0027ll do a thing, you ought not to go back for any other man, let him be who it may,—especially not in respect of a female. It\u0027s weak, and nobody wouldn\u0027t think a straw of you for doing it. It\u0027s some idea of being generous that you have got into your head. There ain\u0027t no real generosity in it. I say it ain\u0027t manly, and that\u0027s what a man ought to be.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mary, though she was standing at the window, pretending to look out of it, knew that during the whole of this conversation Mrs Baggett was making signs at her,—as though indicating an opinion that she was the person in fault. It was as though Mrs Baggett had said that it was for her sake,—to do something to gratify her,—that Mr Whittlestaff was about to go to London. She knew that she at any rate was not to blame. She was struggling for the same end as Mrs Baggett, and did deserve better treatment. \"You oughtn\u0027t to bother going up to London, sir, on any such errand, and so I tells you, Mr Whittlestaff,\" said Mrs Baggett. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have told him the same thing myself,\" said Mary Lawrie, turning round. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If you told him as though you meant it, he wouldn\u0027t go,\" said Mrs Baggett. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s all you know about it,\" said Mr Whittlestaff. \"Now the fact is, I won\u0027t stand this kind of thing. If you mean to remain here, you must be less free with your tongue.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t mean to remain here, Mr Whittlestaff. It\u0027s just that as I\u0027m coming to. There\u0027s Timothy Baggett is down there among the hosses, and he says as I am to go with him. So I\u0027ve come up here to say that if he\u0027s allowed to sleep it off to-day, I\u0027ll be ready to start to-morrow.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I tell you I am not going to make any change at all,\" said Mr Whittlestaff. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You was saying you was going away,—for the honeymoon, I did suppose.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A man may go away if he pleases, without any reason of that kind. Oh dear, oh dear, that letter is not gone! I insist that that letter should go. I suppose I must see about it myself.\" Then when he began to move, the women moved also. Mary went to look after the sandwiches, and Mrs Baggett to despatch the letter. In ten minutes the letter was gone, and half an hour afterwards Mr Whittlestaff had himself driven down to the station. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What is it he means, Miss?\" said Mrs Baggett, when the master was gone. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I do not know,\" said Mary, who was in truth very angry with the old woman. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He wants to make you Mrs Whittlestaff.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"In whatever he wants I shall obey him,—if I only knew how.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s what you is bound to do, Miss Mary. Think of what he has done for you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I require no one to tell me that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What did Mr Gordon come here for, disturbing everybody? Nobody asked him;—at least, I suppose nobody asked him.\" There was an insinuation in this which Mary found it hard to bear. But it was better to bear it than to argue on such a point with the servant. \"And he said things which put the master about terribly.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It was not my doing.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But he\u0027s a man as needn\u0027t have his own way. Why should Mr Gordon have everything just as he likes it? I never heard tell of Mr Gordon till he came here the other day. I don\u0027t think so much of Mr Gordon myself.\" To this Mary, of course, made no answer. \"He\u0027s no business disturbing people when he\u0027s not sent for. I can\u0027t abide to see Mr Whittlestaff put about in this way. I have known him longer than you have.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No doubt.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He\u0027s a man that\u0027ll be driven pretty nigh out of his mind if he\u0027s disappointed.\" Then there was silence, as Mary was determined not to discuss the matter any further. \"If you come to that, you needn\u0027t marry no one unless you pleases.\" Mary was still silent. \"They shouldn\u0027t make me marry them unless I was that way minded. I can\u0027t abide such doings,\" the old woman again went on after a pause. \"I knows what I knows, and I sees what I sees.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What do you know?\" said Mary, driven beyond her powers of silence. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The meaning is, that Mr Whittlestaff is to be disappointed after he have received a promise. Didn\u0027t he have a promise?\" To this Mrs Baggett got no reply, though she waited for one before she went on with her argument. \"You knows he had; and a promise between a lady and gentleman ought to be as good as the law of the land. You stand there as dumb as grim death, and won\u0027t say a word, and yet it all depends upon you. Why is it to go about among everybody, that he\u0027s not to get a wife just because a man\u0027s come home with his pockets full of diamonds? It\u0027s that that people\u0027ll say; and they\u0027ll say that you went back from your word just because of a few precious stones. I wouldn\u0027t like to have it said of me anyhow.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n This was very hard to bear, but Mary found herself compelled to bear it. She had determined not to be led into an argument with Mrs Baggett on the subject, feeling that even to discuss her conduct would be an impropriety. She was strong in her own conduct, and knew how utterly at variance it had been with all that this woman imputed to her. The glitter of the diamonds had been merely thrown in by Mrs Baggett in her passion. Mary did not think that any one would be so base as to believe such an accusation as that. It would be said of her that her own young lover had come back suddenly, and that she had preferred him to the gentleman to whom she was tied by so many bonds. It would be said that she had given herself to him and had then taken back the gift, because the young lover had come across her path. And it would be told also that there had been no word of promise given to this young lover. All that would be very bad, without any allusion to a wealth of diamonds. It would not be said that, before she had pledged herself to Mr Whittlestaff, she had pleaded her affection for her young lover, when she had known nothing even of his present existence. It would not be known that though there had been no lover\u0027s vows between her and John Gordon, there had yet been on both sides that unspoken love which could not have been strengthened by any vows. Against all that she must guard herself, without thinking of the diamonds. She had endeavoured to guard herself, and she had thought also of the contentment of the man who had been so good to her. She had declared to herself that of herself she would think not at all. And she had determined also that all the likings,—nay, the affection of John Gordon himself,—should weigh not at all with her. She had to decide between the two men, and she had decided that both honesty and gratitude required her to comply with the wishes of the elder. She had done all that she could with that object, and was it her fault that Mr Whittlestaff had read the secret of her heart, and had determined to give way before it? This had so touched her that it might almost be said that she knew not to which of her two suitors her heart belonged. All this, if stated in answer to Mrs Baggett\u0027s accusations, would certainly exonerate herself from the stigma thrown upon her, but to Mrs Baggett she could not repeat the explanation. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It nigh drives me wild,\" said Mrs Baggett. \"I don\u0027t suppose you ever heard of Catherine Bailey?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Never.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And I ain\u0027t a-going to tell you. It\u0027s a romance as shall be wrapped inside my own bosom. It was quite a tragedy,—was Catherine Bailey; and one as would stir your heart up if you was to hear it. Catherine Bailey was a young woman. But I\u0027m not going to tell you the story;—only that she was no more fit for Mr Whittlestaff than any of them stupid young girls that walks about the streets gaping in at the shop-windows in Alresford. I do you the justice, Miss Lawrie, to say as you are such a female as he ought to look after.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Thank you, Mrs Baggett.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But she led him into such trouble, because his heart is soft, as was dreadful to look at. He is one of them as always wants a wife. Why didn\u0027t he get one before? you\u0027ll say. Because till you came in the way he was always thinking of Catherine Bailey. Mrs Compas she become. \u0027Drat her and her babies!\u0027 I often said to myself. What was Compas? No more than an Old Bailey lawyer;—not fit to be looked at alongside of our Mr Whittlestaff. No more ain\u0027t Mr John Gordon, to my thinking. You think of all that, Miss Mary, and make up your mind whether you\u0027ll break his heart after giving a promise. Heart-breaking ain\u0027t to him what it is to John Gordon and the likes of him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2727/75125.html","bookId":1404,"book":{"id":1404,"title":"An Old Man\u0027s Love","description":"简介： Mr William Whittlestaff was strolling very slowly up and down the long walk at his country seat in Hampshire, thinking of the contents of a letter which he held crushed up within his trousers\u0027 pocket.
