{"id":25778,"no":13,"title":"VOLUME II. CHAPTER XIII. AT LITTLE ALRESFORD.","content":"Mr Hall was a pleasant English gentleman, now verging upon seventy years of age, who had \"never had a headache in his life,\" as he was wont to boast, but who lived very carefully, as one who did not intend to have many headaches. He certainly did not intend to make his head ache by the cares of the work of the world. He was very well off;—that is to say, that with so many thousands a year, he managed to live upon half. This he had done for very many years, because the estate was entailed on a distant relative, and because he had not chosen to leave his children paupers. When the girls came he immediately resolved that he would never go up to London,—and kept his resolve. Not above once in three or four years was it supposed to be necessary that he showed his head to a London hairdresser. He was quite content to have a practitioner out from Alresford, and to pay him one shilling, including the journey. His tenants in these bad times had always paid their rents, but they had done so because their rents had not been raised since the squire had come to the throne. Mr Hall knew well that if he was anxious to save himself from headaches in that line, he had better let his lands on easy terms. He was very hospitable, but he never gave turtle from London, or fish from Southampton, or strawberries or peas on the first of April. He could give a dinner without champagne, and thought forty shillings a dozen price enough for port or sherry, or even claret. He kept a carriage for his four daughters, and did not tell all the world that the horses spent a fair proportion of their time at the plough. The four daughters had two saddle-horses between them, and the father had another for his own use. He did not hunt,—and living in that part of Hampshire, I think he was right. He did shoot after the manner of our forefathers;—would go out, for instance, with Mr Blake, and perhaps Mr Whittlestaff, and would bring home three pheasants, four partridges, a hare, and any quantity of rabbits that the cook might have ordered. He was a man determined on no account to live beyond his means; and was not very anxious to seem to be rich. He was a man of no strong affections, or peculiarly generous feelings. Those who knew him, and did not like him, said that he was selfish. They who were partial to him declared that he never owed a shilling that he could not pay, and that his daughters were very happy in having such a father. He was a good-looking man, with well-formed features, but one whom you had to see often before you could remember him. And as I have said before, he \"never had a headache in his life.\" \"When your father wasn\u0027t doing quite so well with the bank as his friends wished, he asked me to do something for him. Well; I didn\u0027t see my way.\" \n \n \"I was a boy then, and I heard nothing of my father\u0027s business.\" \n \n \"I dare say not; but I cannot help telling you. He thought I was unkind. I thought that he would go on from one trouble to another;—and he did. He quarrelled with me, and for years we never spoke. Indeed I never saw him again. But for the sake of old friendship, I am very glad to meet you.\" This he said, as he was walking across the hall to the drawing-room. \n \n There Gordon met the young ladies with the clergyman, and had to undergo the necessary introductions. He thought that he could perceive at once that his story, as it regarded Mary Lawrie, had been told to all of them. Gordon was quick, and could learn from the manners of his companions what had been said about him, and could perceive that they were aware of something of his story. Blake had no such quickness, and could attribute none of it to another. \"I am very proud to have the pleasure of making you acquainted with these five young ladies.\" As he said this he had just paused in his narrative of Mr Whittlestaff\u0027s love, and was certain that he had changed the conversation with great effect. But the young ladies were unable not to look as young ladies would have looked when hearing the story of an unfortunate gentleman\u0027s love. And Mr Blake would certainly have been unable to keep such a secret. \n \n \"This is Miss Hall, and this is Miss Augusta Hall,\" said the father. \"People do think that they are alike.\" \n \n \"Oh, papa, what nonsense! You needn\u0027t tell Mr Gordon that.\" \n \n \"No doubt he would find it out without telling,\" continued the father. \n \n \"I can\u0027t see it, for the life of me,\" said Mr Blake. He evidently thought that civility demanded such an assertion. Mr Gordon, looking at the two young ladies, felt that he would never know them apart though he might live in the house for a year. \n \n \"Evelina is the third,\" continued Mr Hall, pointing out the one whom Mr Blake had specially recommended to his friend\u0027s notice. \"Evelina is not quite so like, but she\u0027s like too.\" \n \n \"Papa, what nonsense you do talk!\" said Evelina. \n \n \"And this is Mary. Mary considers herself to be quite the hope of the family; spem gregis. Ha, ha!\" \n \n \"What does spem gregis mean? I\u0027m sure I don\u0027t know,\" said Mary. The four young ladies were about thirty, varying up from thirty to thirty-five. They were fair-haired, healthy young women, with good common-sense, not beautiful, though very like their father. \n \n \"And now I must introduce you to Miss Forrester,—Kattie Forrester,\" said Mr Blake, who was beginning to think that his own young lady was being left out in the cold. \n \n \"Yes, indeed,\" said Mr Hall. \"As I had begun with my own, I was obliged to go on to the end. Miss Forrester—Mr Gordon. Miss Forrester is a young lady whose promotion has been fixed in the world.\" \n \n \"Mr Hall, how can you do me so much injury as to say that? You take away from me the chance of changing my mind.\" \n \n \"Yes,\" said the oldest Miss Hall; \"and Mr Gordon the possibility of changing his. Mr Gordon, what a sad thing it is that Mr Harbottle should never have had an opportunity of seeing his old parish once again.\" \n \n \"I never knew him,\" said Gordon. \n \n \"But he had been here nearly fifty years. And then to leave the parish without seeing it any more. It\u0027s very sad when you look at it in that light.\" \n \n \"He has never resided here permanently for a quarter of a century,\" said Mr Blake. \n \n \"Off and on in the summer time,\" said Augusta. \"Of course he could not take much of the duty, because he had a clergyman\u0027s throat. I think it a great pity that he should have gone off so suddenly.\" \n \n \"Miss Forrester won\u0027t wish to have his resurgam sung, I warrant you,\" said Mr Hall. \n \n \"I don\u0027t know much about resurgams,\" said the young lady, \"but I don\u0027t see why the parish shall not be just as well in Mr Blake\u0027s hands.\" Then the young bride was taken away by the four elder ladies to dress, and the gentlemen followed them half an hour afterwards. \n \n They were all very kind to him, and sitting after dinner, Mr Hall suggested that Mr Whittlestaff and Miss Lawrie should be asked over to dine on the next day. John Gordon had already promised to stay until the third, and had made known his intention of going back to South Africa as soon as he could arrange matters. \"I\u0027ve got nothing to keep me here,\" he said, \"and as there is a good deal of money at stake, I should be glad to be there as soon as possible.\" \n \n \"Oh, come! I don\u0027t know about your having nothing to keep you here,\" said Blake. But as to Mr Hall\u0027s proposition regarding the inhabitants of Croker\u0027s Lodge, Gordon said nothing. He could not object to the guests whom a gentleman might ask to his own house; but he thought it improbable that either Mr Whittlestaff or Mary should come. If he chose to appear and to bring her with him, it must be his own look-out. At any rate he, Gordon, could say and could do nothing on such an occasion. He had been betrayed into telling his secret to this garrulous young parson. There was no help for spilt milk; but it was not probable that Mr Blake would go any further, and he at any rate must be content to bear the man\u0027s society for one other evening. \"I don\u0027t see why you shouldn\u0027t manage to make things pleasant even yet,\" said the parson. But to this John Gordon made no reply. \n \n In the evening some of the sisters played a few pieces at the piano, and Miss Forrester sang a few songs. Mr Hall in the meantime went fast asleep. John Gordon couldn\u0027t but tell himself that his evenings at Kimberley were, as a rule, quite as exciting. But then Kattie Forrester did not belong to him, and he had not found himself able as yet to make a choice between the young ladies. It was, however, interesting to see the manner in which the new vicar hung about the lady of his love, and the evident but innocent pride with which she accepted the attentions of her admirer. \n \n \"Don\u0027t you think she\u0027s a beautiful girl?\" said Blake, coming to Gordon\u0027s room after they had all retired to bed; \"such genuine wit, and so bright, and her singing, you know, is quite perfect,—absolutely just what it ought to be. I do know something about singing myself, because I\u0027ve had all the parish voices under my own charge for the last three years. A practice like that goes a long way, you know.\" To this Mr Gordon could only give that assent which silence is intended to imply. \"She\u0027ll have ￡5000 at once, you know, which does make her in a manner equal to either of the Miss Halls. I don\u0027t quite know what they\u0027ll have, but not more than that, I should think. The property is entailed, and he\u0027s a saving man. But if he can have put by ￡20,000, he has done very well; don\u0027t you think so?\" \n \n \"Very well indeed.\" \n \n \"I suppose I might have had one of them; I don\u0027t mind telling you in strictest confidence. But, goodness gracious, after I had once seen Kattie Forrester, there was no longer a doubt. I wish you\u0027d tell me what you think about her.\" \n \n \"About Miss Forrester?\" \n \n \"You needn\u0027t mind speaking quite openly to me. I\u0027m that sort of fellow that I shouldn\u0027t mind what any fellow said. I\u0027ve formed my own ideas, and am not likely to change them. But I should like to hear, you know, how she strikes a fellow who has been at the diamond-fields. I cannot imagine but that you must have a different idea about women to what we have.\" Then Mr Blake sat himself down in an arm-chair at the foot of the bed, and prepared himself to discuss the opinion which he did not doubt that his friend was about to deliver. \n \n \"A very nice young woman indeed,\" said John Gordon, who was anxious to go to bed. \n \n \"Ah, you know,—that\u0027s a kind of thing that anybody can say. There is no real friendship in that. I want to know the true candid opinion of a man who has travelled about the world, and has been at the diamond-fields. It isn\u0027t everybody who has been at the diamond-fields,\" continued he, thinking that he might thereby flatter his friend. \n \n \"No, not everybody. I suppose a young woman is the same there as here, if she have the same natural gifts. Miss Forrester would be pretty anywhere.\" \n \n \"That\u0027s a matter of course. Any fellow can see that with half an eye. Absolutely beautiful, I should say, rather than pretty.\" \n \n \"Just so. It\u0027s only a variation in terms, you know.\" \n \n \"But then her manner, her music, her language, her wit, and the colour of her hair! When I remember it all, I think I\u0027m the luckiest fellow in the world. I shall be a deal happier with her than with Augusta Hall. Don\u0027t you think so? Augusta was the one intended for me; but, bless you, I couldn\u0027t look at her after I had seen Kattie Forrester. I don\u0027t think you\u0027ve given me your true unbiassed opinion yet.\" \n \n \"Indeed I have,\" said John Gordon. \n \n \"Well; I should be more free-spoken than that, if you were to ask me about Mary Lawrie. But then, of course, Mary Lawrie is not your engaged one. It does make a difference. If it does turn out that she marries Mr Whittlestaff, I shan\u0027t think much of her, I can tell you that. As it is, as far as looks are concerned, you can\u0027t compare her to my Kattie.\" \n \n \"Comparisons are odious,\" said Gordon. \n \n \"Well, yes; when you are sure to get the worst of them. You wouldn\u0027t think comparisons odious if you were going to marry Kattie, and it was my lot to have Mary Lawrie. Well, yes; I don\u0027t mind going to bed now, as you have owned so much as that.\" \n \n \"Of all the fools,\" said Gordon to himself, as he went to his own chamber,—\"of all the fools who were ever turned out in the world to earn their own bread, he is the most utterly foolish. Yet he will earn his bread, and will come to no especial grief in the work. If he were to go out to Kimberley, no one would pay him a guinea a-week. But he will perform the high work of a clergyman of the Church of England indifferently well.\" \n \n On the next morning a messenger was sent over to Croker\u0027s Hall, and came back after due lapse of time with an answer to the effect that Mr Whittlestaff and Miss Lawrie would have pleasure in dining that day at Little Alresford Park. \"That\u0027s right,\" said Mr Blake to the lady of his love. \"We shall now, perhaps, be able to put the thing into a proper groove. I\u0027m always very lucky in managing such matters. Not that I think that Gordon cares very much about the young lady, judging from what he says of her.\" \n \n \"Then I don\u0027t see why you should interest yourself.\" \n \n \"For the young lady\u0027s sake. A lady always prefers a young gentleman to an old one. Only think what you\u0027d feel if you were married to Mr Whittlestaff.\" \n \n \"Oh, Montagu! how can you talk such nonsense?\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t suppose you ever would, because you are not one of those sort of young ladies. I don\u0027t suppose that Mary Lawrie likes it herself; and therefore I\u0027d break the match off in a moment if I could. That\u0027s what I call good-natured.\" \n \n After lunch they all went off to the Rookery, which was at the other side of the park from Gar Wood. It was a beautiful spot, lying at the end of the valley, through which they had to get out from their carriage, and to walk for half a mile. Only for the sake of doing honour to Miss Forrester, they would have gone on foot. But as it was, they had all the six horses among them. Mr Gordon was put up on one of the young ladies\u0027 steeds, the squire and the parson each had his own, and Miss Evelina was also mounted, as Mr Blake had suggested, perhaps with the view to the capture of Mr Gordon. \"As it\u0027s your first day,\" whispered Mr Blake to Kattie, \"it is so nice, I think, that the carriage and horses should all come out. Of course there is nothing in the distance, but there should be a respect shown on such an occasion. Mr Hall does do everything of this kind just as it should be.\" \n \n \"I suppose you know the young lady who is coming here to-night,\" said Evelina to Mr Gordon. \n \n \"Oh, yes; I knew her before I went abroad.\" \n \n \"But not Mr Whittlestaff?\" \n \n \"I had never met Mr Whittlestaff, though I had heard much of his goodness.\" \n \n \"And now they are to be married. Does it not seem to you to be very hard?\" \n \n \"Not in the least. The young lady seems to have been left by her father and step-mother without any engagement, and, indeed, without any provision. She was brought here, in the first place, from sheer charity, and I can certainly understand that when she was here Mr Whittlestaff should have admired her.\" \n \n \"That\u0027s a matter of course,\" said Evelina. \n \n \"Mr Whittlestaff is not at all too old to fall in love with any young lady. This is a pretty place,—a very lovely spot. I think I like it almost better than Gar Wood.\" Then there was no more said about Mary Lawrie till they all rode back to dinner. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2727/75119.html","bookId":1404,"book":{"id":1404,"title":"An Old Man\u0027s Love","description":"简介： Mr William Whittlestaff was strolling very slowly up and down the long walk at his country seat in Hampshire, thinking of the contents of a letter which he held crushed up within his trousers\u0027 pocket.
