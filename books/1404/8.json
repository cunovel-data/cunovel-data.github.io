{"id":25773,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER VIII. JOHN GORDON AND MARY LAWRIE.","content":"The door was closed, and John Gordon and Mary were alone together. She was still seated, and he, coming forward, stood in front of her. \"Mary,\" he said,—and he put out his right hand, as though to take hers. But she sat quite still, making no motion to give him her hand. Nor did she say a word. To her her promise, her reiterated promise, to Mr Whittlestaff was binding,—not the less binding because it had only been made on this very day. She had already acknowledged to this other man that the promise had been made, and she had asked him to spare her this interview. He had not spared her, and it was for him now to say, while it lasted, what there was to be said. She had settled the matter in her own mind, and had made him understand that it was so settled. There was nothing further that she could tell him. \"Mary, now that we are alone, will you not speak to me?\" \n \n \"I have nothing to say.\" \n \n \"Should I not have come to you?\" \n \n \"You should not have stayed when you found that I had promised myself to another.\" \n \n \"Is there nothing else that I may wish to say to you?\" \n \n \"There is nothing else that you should wish to say to the wife of another man.\" \n \n \"You are not his wife,—not yet.\" \n \n \"I shall be his wife, Mr Gordon. You may be sure of that. And I think—think I can say of myself that I shall be a true wife. He has chosen to take me; and as he has so chosen, his wishes must be respected. He has asked you to remain here as a friend, understanding that to be the case. But as you do not choose, you should go.\" \n \n \"Do you wish me to stay, and to see you become his wife?\" \n \n \"I say nothing of that. It is not for me to insist on my wishes. I have expressed one wish, and you have refused to grant it. Nothing can pass between you and me which must not, I should say, be painful to both of us.\" \n \n \"You would have me go then,—so that you should never hear of or see me again?\" \n \n \"I shall never see you, I suppose. What good would come of seeing you?\" \n \n \"And you can bear to part with me after this fashion?\" \n \n \"It has to be borne. The world is full of hard things, which have to be borne. It is not made to run smoothly altogether, either for you or for me. You must bear your cross,—and so must I.\" \n \n \"And that is the only word I am to receive, after having struggled so hard for you, and having left all my work, and all my cares, and all my property, in order that I might come home, and catch just one glance of your eye. Can you not say a word to me, a word of kindness, that I may carry back with me?\" \n \n \"Not a word. If you will think of it, you ought not to ask me for a word of kindness. What does a kind word mean—a kind word coming from me to you? There was a time when I wanted a kind word, but I did not ask for it. At the time it did not suit. Nor does it suit now. Put yourself in Mr Whittlestaff\u0027s case; would you wish the girl to whom you were engaged to say kind words behind your back to some other man? If you heard them, would you not think that she was a traitor? He has chosen to trust me,—against my advice, indeed; but he has trusted me, and I know myself to be trustworthy. There shall be no kind word spoken.\" \n \n \"Mary,\" said he, \"when did all this happen?\" \n \n \"It has been happening, I suppose, from the first day that I came into his house.\" \n \n \"But when was it settled? When did he ask you to be his wife? Or when, rather, did you make him the promise?\" John Gordon fancied that since he had been at Croker\u0027s Hall words had been spoken, or that he had seen signs, indicating that the engagement had not been of a long date. And in every word that she had uttered to him he had heard whispered under her breath an assurance of her perfect love for himself. He had been sure of her love when he had left the house at Norwich, in which he had been told that he had been lingering there to no good purpose; but he had never been more certain than he was at this moment, when she coldly bade him go and depart back again to his distant home in the diamond-fields. And now, in her mock anger and in her indignant words, with the purpose of her mind written so clearly on her brow, she was to him more lovable and more beautiful than ever. Could it be fair to him as a man that he should lose the prize which was to him of such inestimable value, merely for a word of cold assent given to this old man, and given, as he thought, quite lately? His devotion to her was certainly assured. Nothing could be more fixed, less capable of a doubt, than his love. And he, too, was somewhat proud of himself in that he had endeavoured to entangle her by no promise till he had secured for himself and for her the means of maintaining her. He had gone out and he had come back with silent hopes, with hopes which he had felt must be subject to disappointment, because he knew himself to be a reticent, self-restrained man; and because he had been aware that \"the world,\" as she had said, \"is full of hard things which have to be borne.\" \n \n But now if, as he believed, the engagement was but of recent date, there would be a hardship in it, which even he could not bear patiently,—a hardship, the endurance of which must be intolerable to her. If it were so, the man could hardly be so close-fisted, so hard-hearted, so cruel-minded, as to hold the girl to her purpose! \"When did you promise to be his wife?\" he said, repeating his question. Now there came over Mary\u0027s face a look of weakness, the opposite to the strength which she had displayed when she had bade him not ask her for a word of kindness. To her the promise was the same, was as strong, even though it had been made but that morning, as though weeks and months had intervened. But she felt that to him there would be an apparent weakness in the promise of her engagement, if she told him that it was made only on that morning. \"When was it, Mary?\" \n \n \"It matters nothing,\" she said. \n \n \"But it does matter—to me.\" \n \n Then a sense of what was fitting told her that it was incumbent on her to tell him the truth. Sooner or later he would assuredly know, and it was well that he should know the entire truth from her lips. She could not put up with the feeling that he should go away deceived in any degree by herself. \n \n \"It was this morning,\" she said. \n \n \"This very morning?\" \n \n \"It was on this morning that I gave my word to Mr Whittlestaff, and promised to become his wife.\" \n \n \"And had I been here yesterday I should not have been too late?\" \n \n Here she looked up imploringly into his face. She could not answer that question, nor ought he to press for an answer. And the words were no sooner out of his mouth than he felt that it was so. It was not to her that he must address any such remonstrance as that. \"This morning!\" he repeated—\"only this morning!\" \n \n But he did not know, nor could she tell him, that she had pleaded her love for him when Mr Whittlestaff had asked her. She could not tell him of that second meeting, at which she had asked Mr Whittlestaff that even yet he should let her go. It had seemed to her, as she had thought of it, that Mr Whittlestaff had behaved well to her, had intended to do a good thing to her, and had ignored the other man, who had vanished, as it were, from the scene of their joint lives, because he had become one who ought not to be allowed to interest her any further. She had endeavoured to think of it with stern justice, accusing herself of absurd romance, and giving Mr Whittlestaff credit for all goodness. This had been before John Gordon had appeared among them; and now she struggled hard not to be less just to Mr Whittlestaff than before, because of this accident. She knew him well enough to be aware that he could not easily be brought to abandon the thing on which he had set his mind. It all passed through her mind as she prepared her answer for John Gordon. \"It can make no difference,\" she said. \"A promise is a promise, though it be but an hour old.\" \n \n \"That is to be my answer?\" \n \n \"Yes, that is to be your answer. Ask yourself, and you will know that there is no other answer that I can honestly make you.\" \n \n \"How is your own heart in the affair?\" \n \n There she was weak, and knew as she spoke that she was weak. \"It matters not at all,\" she said. \n \n \"It matters not at all?\" he repeated after her. \"I can understand that my happiness should be nothing. If you and he were satisfied, of course it would be nothing. If you were satisfied, there would be an end to it; because if your pleasure and his work together, I must necessarily be left out in the cold. But it is not so. I take upon myself to say that you are not satisfied.\" \n \n \"You will not allow me to answer for myself?\" \n \n \"No, not in this matter. Will you dare to tell me that you do not love me?\" She remained silent before him, and then he went on to reason with her. \"You do not deny it. I hear it in your voice and see it in your face. When we parted in Norwich, did you not love me then?\" \n \n \"I shall answer no such question. A young woman has often to change her mind as to whom she loves, before she can settle down as one man\u0027s wife or another\u0027s.\" \n \n \"You do not dare to be true. If I am rough with you, it is for your sake as well as my own. We are young, and, as was natural, we learnt to love each other. Then you came here and were alone in the world, and I was gone. Though there had been no word of marriage between us, I had hoped that I might be remembered in my absence. Perhaps you did remember me. I cannot think that I was ever absent from your heart; but I was away, and you could not know how loyal I was to my thoughts of you. I am not blaming you, Mary. I can well understand that you were eating his bread and drinking his cup, and that it appeared to you that everything was due to him. You could not have gone on eating his bread unless you had surrendered yourself to his wishes. You must have gone from this, and have had no home to which to go. It is all true. But the pity of it, Mary; the pity of it!\" \n \n \"He has done the best he could by me.\" \n \n \"Perhaps so; but if done from that reason, the surrender will be the easier.\" \n \n \"No, no, no; I know more of him than you do. No such surrender will come easy to him. He has set his heart upon this thing, and as far as I am concerned he shall have it.\" \n \n \"You will go to him with a lie in your mouth?\" \n \n \"I do not know. I cannot say what the words may be. If there be a lie, I will tell it.\" \n \n \"Then you do love me still?\" \n \n \"You may cheat me out of my thoughts, but it will be to no good. Whether I lie or tell the truth, I will do my duty by him. There will be no lying. To the best of my ability I will love him, and him only. All my care shall be for him. I have resolved, and I will force myself to love him. All his qualities are good. There is not a thought in his mind of which he need be ashamed.\" \n \n \"Not when he will use his power to take you out of my arms.\" \n \n \"No, sir; for I am not your property. You speak of dealing with me, as though I must necessarily belong to you if I did not belong to him. It is not so.\" \n \n \"Oh, Mary!\" \n \n \"It is not so. What might be the case I will not take upon myself to say,—or what might have been. I was yesterday a free woman, and my thoughts were altogether my own. To-day I am bound to him, and whether it be for joy or for sorrow, I will be true to him. Now, Mr Gordon, I will leave you.\" \n \n \"Half a moment,\" he said, standing between her and the door. \"It cannot be that this should be the end of all between us. I shall go to him, and tell him what I believe to be the truth.\" \n \n \"I cannot hinder you; but I shall tell him that what you say is false.\" \n \n \"You know it to be true.\" \n \n \"I shall tell him that it is false.\" \n \n \"Can you bring yourself to utter a lie such as that?\" \n \n \"I can bring myself to say whatever may be best for him, and most conducive to his wishes.\" But as she said this, she was herself aware that she had told Mr Whittlestaff only on this morning that she had given her heart to John Gordon, and that she would be unable to keep her thoughts from running to him. She had implored him to leave her to herself, so that the memory of her love might be spared. Then, when this young man had been still absent, when there was no dream of his appearing again before her, when the consequence would be that she must go forth into the world, and earn her own bitter bread alone,—at that moment she knew that she had been true to the memory of the man. What had occurred since, to alter her purpose so violently? Was it the presence of the man she did love, and the maidenly instincts which forbade her to declare her passion in his presence? Or was it simply the conviction that her promise to Mr Whittlestaff had been twice repeated, and could not now admit of being withdrawn? But in spite of her asseverations, there must have been present to her mind some feeling that if Mr Whittlestaff would yield to the prayer of John Gordon, all the gulf would be bridged over which yawned between herself and perfect happiness. Kimberley? Yes, indeed; or anywhere else in the wide world. As he left the room, she did now tell herself that in spite of all that she had said she could accompany him anywhere over the world with perfect bliss. How well had he spoken for himself, and for his love! How like a man he had looked, when he had asked her that question, \"Will you dare to tell me that you do not love me?\" She had not dared; even though at the moment she had longed to leave upon him the impression that it was so. She had told him that she would lie to Mr Whittlestaff,—lie on Mr Whittlestaff\u0027s own behalf. But such a lie as this she could not tell to John Gordon. He had heard it in her voice and seen it in her face. She knew it well, and was aware that it must be so. \n \n \"The pity of it,\" she too said to herself; \"the pity of it!\" If he had but come a week sooner,—but a day sooner, before Mr Whittlestaff had spoken out his mind,—no love-tale would ever have run smoother. In that case she would have accepted John Gordon without a moment\u0027s consideration. When he should have told her of his distant home, of the roughness of his life, of the changes and chances to which his career must be subject, she would have assured him, with her heart full of joy, that she would accept it all and think her lot so happy as to admit of no complaint. Mr Whittlestaff would then have known the condition of her heart, before he had himself spoken a word. And as the trouble would always have been in his own bosom, there would, so to say, have been no trouble at all. A man\u0027s sorrows of that kind do not commence, or at any rate are not acutely felt, while the knowledge of the matter from which they grow is confined altogether to his own bosom. \n \n But she resolved, sitting there after John Gordon had left her, that in the circumstances as they existed, it was her duty to bear what sorrow there was to be borne. Poor John Gordon! He must bear some sorrow too, if there should be cause to him for grief. There would be loss of money, and loss of time, which would of themselves cause him grief. Poor John Gordon! She did not blame him in that he had gone away, and not said one word to draw from her some assurance of her love. It was the nature of the man, which in itself was good and noble. But in this case it had surely been unfortunate. With such a passion at his heart, it was rash in him to have gone across the world to the diamond-fields without speaking a word by which they two might have held themselves as bound together. The pity of it! \n \n But as circumstances had gone, honour and even honesty demanded that Mr Whittlestaff should not be allowed to suffer. He at least had been straightforward in his purpose, and had spoken as soon as he had been assured of his own mind. Mr Whittlestaff should at any rate have his reward. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2727/75114.html","bookId":1404,"book":{"id":1404,"title":"An Old Man\u0027s Love","description":"简介： Mr William Whittlestaff was strolling very slowly up and down the long walk at his country seat in Hampshire, thinking of the contents of a letter which he held crushed up within his trousers\u0027 pocket.
