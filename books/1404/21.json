THE GREEN PARK.","content":"\\n\\n He asked whether Mr John Gordon was within, and in two minutes found himself standing in the hall with that hero of romance. Mr Whittlestaff told himself, as he looked at the man, that he was such a hero as ought to be happy in his love. Whereas of himself, he was conscious of a personal appearance which no girl could be expected to adore. He thought too much of his personal appearance generally, complaining to himself that it was mean; whereas in regard to Mary Lawrie, it may be said that no such idea had ever entered her mind. \"It was just because he had come first,\" she would have said if asked. And the \"he\" alluded to would have been John Gordon. \"He had come first, and therefore I had learned to love him.\" It was thus that Mary Lawrie would have spoken. But Mr Whittlestaff, as he looked up into John Gordon\u0027s face, felt that he himself was mean. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You got my letter, Mr Gordon?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes; I got it last night.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have come up to London, because there is something that I want to say to you. It is something that I can\u0027t very well put up into a letter, and therefore I have taken the trouble to come to town.\" As he said this he endeavoured, no doubt, to assert his own dignity by the look which he assumed. Nor did he intend that Mr Gordon should know anything of the struggle which he had endured. \\n\\n \\n\\n But Mr Gordon knew as well what Mr Whittlestaff had to say as did Mr Whittlestaff himself. He had turned the matter over in his own mind since the letter had reached him, and was aware that there could be no other cause for seeing him which could bring Mr Whittlestaff up to London. But a few days since he had made an appeal to Mr Whittlestaff—an appeal which certainly might require much thought for its answer—and here was Mr Whittlestaff with his reply. It could not have been made quicker. It was thus that John Gordon had thought of it as he had turned Mr Whittlestaff\u0027s letter over in his mind. The appeal had been made readily enough. The making of it had been easy; the words to be spoken had come quickly, and without the necessity for a moment\u0027s premeditation. He had known it all, and from a full heart the mouth speaks. But was it to have been expected that a man so placed as had been Mr Whittlestaff, should be able to give his reply with equal celerity? He, John Gordon, had seen at once on reaching Croker\u0027s Hall the state in which things were. Almost hopelessly he had made his appeal to the man who had her promise. Then he had met the man at Mr Hall\u0027s house, and hardly a word had passed between them. What word could have been expected? Montagu Blake, with all his folly, had judged rightly in bringing them together. When he received the letter, John Gordon had remembered that last word which Mr Whittlestaff had spoken to him in the squire\u0027s hall. He had thought of the appeal, and had resolved to give an answer to it. It was an appeal which required an answer. He had turned it over in his mind, and had at last told himself what the answer should be. John Gordon had discovered all that when he received the letter, and it need hardly be said that his feelings in regard to Mr Whittlestaff were very much kinder than those of Mr Whittlestaff to him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Perhaps you wouldn\u0027t mind coming out into the street,\" said Mr Whittlestaff. \"I can\u0027t say very well what I\u0027ve got to say in here.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Certainly,\" said Gordon; \"I will go anywhere.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Let us go into the Park. It is green there, and there is some shade among the trees.\" Then they went out of the club into Pall Mall, and Mr Whittlestaff walked on ahead without a word. \"No; we will not go down there,\" he said, as he passed the entrance into St. James\u0027s Park by Marlborough House, and led the way through St. James\u0027s Palace into the Green Park. \"We\u0027ll go on till we come to the trees; there are seats there, unless the people have occupied them all. One can\u0027t talk here under the blazing sun;—at least I can\u0027t.\" Then he walked on at a rapid pace, wiping his brow as he did so. \"Yes, there\u0027s a seat. I\u0027ll be hanged if that man isn\u0027t going to sit down upon it! What a beast he is! No, I can\u0027t sit down on a seat that another man is occupying. I don\u0027t want any one to hear what I\u0027ve got to say. There! Two women have gone a little farther on.\" Then he hurried to the vacant bench and took possession of it. It was placed among the thick trees which give a perfect shade on the north side of the Park, and had Mr Whittlestaff searched all London through, he could not have found a more pleasant spot in which to make his communication. \"This will do,\" said he. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Very nicely indeed,\" said John Gordon. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I couldn\u0027t talk about absolutely private business in the hall of the club, you know.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I could have taken you into a private room, Mr Whittlestaff, had you wished it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"With everybody coming in and out, just as they pleased. I don\u0027t believe in private rooms in London clubs. What I\u0027ve got to say can be said better sub dio. I suppose you know what it is that I\u0027ve got to talk about.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hardly,\" said John Gordon. \"But that is not exactly true. I think I know, but I am not quite sure of it. On such a subject I should not like to make a surmise unless I were confident.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s about Miss Lawrie.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I suppose so.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What makes you suppose that?\" said Whittlestaff, sharply. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You told me that you were sure I should know.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"So I am, quite sure. You came all the way down to Alresford to see her. If you spoke the truth, you came all the way home from the diamond-fields with the same object.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I certainly spoke the truth, Mr Whittlestaff.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then what\u0027s the good of your pretending not to know?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have not pretended. I merely said that I could not presume to put the young lady\u0027s name into your mouth until you had uttered it yourself. There could be no other subject of conversation between you and me of which I was aware.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You had spoken to me about her,\" said Mr Whittlestaff. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No doubt I had. When I found that you had given her a home, and had made yourself, as it were, a father to her—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I had not made myself her father,—nor yet her mother. I had loved her, as you profess to do.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My profession is at any rate true.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I daresay. You may or you mayn\u0027t; I at any rate know nothing about it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why otherwise should I have come home and left my business in South Africa? I think you may take it for granted that I love her.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t care twopence whether you do or don\u0027t,\" said Mr Whittlestaff. \"It\u0027s nothing to me whom you love. I should have been inclined to say at first sight that a man groping in the dirt for diamonds wouldn\u0027t love any one. And even if you did, though you might break your heart and die, it would be nothing to me. Had you done so, I should not have heard of you, nor should I have wished to hear of you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n There was an incivility in all this of which John Gordon felt that he was obliged to take some notice. There was a want of courtesy in the man\u0027s manner rather than his words, which he could not quite pass by, although he was most anxious to do so. \"I daresay not,\" said he; \"but here I am and here also is Miss Lawrie. I had said what I had to say down at Alresford, and of course it is for you now to decide what is to be done. I have never supposed that you would care personally for me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You needn\u0027t be so conceited about yourself.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know that I am,\" said Gordon;—\"except that a man cannot but be a little conceited who has won the love of Mary Lawrie.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You think it impossible that I should have done so.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"At any rate I did it before you had seen her. Though I may be conceited, I am not more conceited for myself than you are for yourself. Had I not known her, you would probably have engaged her affections. I had known her, and you are aware of the result. But it is for you to decide. Miss Lawrie thinks that she owes you a debt which she is bound to pay if you exact it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Exact it!\" exclaimed Mr Whittlestaff. \"There is no question of exacting!\" John Gordon shrugged his shoulders. \"I say there is no question of exacting. The words should not have been used. She has my full permission to choose as she may think fit, and she knows that she has it. What right have you to speak to me of exacting?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr Whittlestaff had now talked himself into such a passion, and was apparently so angry at the word which his companion had used, that John Gordon began to doubt whether he did in truth know the purpose for which the man had come to London. Could it be that he had made the journey merely with the object of asserting that he had the power of making this girl his wife, and of proving his power by marrying her. \"What is it that you wish, Mr Whittlestaff?\" he asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Wish! What business have you to ask after my wishes? But you know what my wishes are very well. I will not pretend to keep them in the dark. She came to my house, and I soon learned to desire that she should be my wife. If I know what love is, I loved her. If I know what love is, I do love her still. She is all the world to me. I have no diamonds to care for; I have no rich mines to occupy my heart; I am not eager in the pursuit of wealth. I had lived a melancholy, lonely life till this young woman had come to my table,—till I had felt her sweet hand upon mine,—till she had hovered around me, covering everything with bright sunshine. Then I asked her to be my wife;—and she told me of you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She told you of me?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes; she told me of you—of you who might then have been dead, for aught she knew. And when I pressed her, she said that she would think of you always.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She said so?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes; that she would think of you always. But she did not say that she would always love you. And in the same breath she promised to be my wife. I was contented,—and yet not quite contented. Why should she think of you always? But I believed that it would not be so. I thought that if I were good to her, I should overcome her. I knew that I should be better to her than you would be.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why should I not be good to her?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There is an old saying of a young man\u0027s slave and an old man\u0027s darling. She would at any rate have been my darling. It might be that she would have been your slave.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My fellow-workman in all things.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You think so now; but the man always becomes the master. If you grovelled in the earth for diamonds, she would have to look for them amidst the mud and slime.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have never dreamed of taking her to the diamond-fields.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It would have been so in all other pursuits.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She would have had none that she had not chosen,\" said John Gordon. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How am I to know that? How am I to rest assured that the world would be smooth to her if she were your creature? I am not assured—I do not know.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Who can tell, as you say? Can I promise her a succession of joys if she be my wife? She is not one who will be likely to look for such a life as that. She will know that she must take the rough and smooth together.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There would have been no rough with me,\" said Mr Whittlestaff. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I do not believe in such a life,\" said John Gordon. \"A woman should not wear a stuff gown always; but the silk finery and the stuff gown should follow each other. To my taste, the more there may be of the stuff gown and the less of the finery, the more it will be to my wishes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am not speaking of her gowns. It is not of such things as those that I am thinking.\" Here Mr Whittlestaff got up from the bench, and began walking rapidly backwards and forwards under the imperfect shade on the path. \"You will beat her.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think not.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Beat her in the spirit. You will domineer over her, and desire to have your own way. When she is toiling for you, you will frown at her. Because you have business on hand, or perhaps pleasure, you will leave her in solitude. There may a time come when the diamonds shall have all gone.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If she is to be mine, that time will have come already. The diamonds will be sold. Did you ever see a diamond in my possession? Why do you twit me with diamonds? If I had been a coal-owner, should I have been expected to keep my coals?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"These things stick to the very soul of a man. They are a poison of which he cannot rid himself. They are like gambling. They make everything cheap that should be dear, and everything dear that should be cheap. I trust them not at all,—and I do not trust you, because you deal in them.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I tell you that I shall not deal in them. But, Mr Whittlestaff, I must tell you that you are unreasonable.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No doubt. I am a poor miserable man who does not know the world. I have never been to the diamond-fields. Of course I understand nothing of the charms of speculation. A quiet life with my book is all that I care for;—with just one other thing, one other thing. You begrudge me that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mr Whittlestaff, it does not signify a straw what I begrudge you.\" Mr Whittlestaff had now come close to him, and was listening to him. \"Nor, as I take it, what you begrudge me. Before I left England she and I had learned to love each other. It is so still. For the sake of her happiness, do you mean to let me have her?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I do.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You do?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of course I do. You have known it all along. Of course I do. Do you think I would make her miserable? Would it be in my bosom to make her come and live with a stupid, silly old man, to potter on from day to day without any excitement? Would I force her into a groove in which her days would be wretched to her? Had she come to me and wanted bread, and have seen before her all the misery of poverty, the stone-coldness of a governess\u0027s life; had she been left to earn her bread without any one to love her, it might then have been different. She would have looked out into another world, and have seen another prospect. A comfortable home with kindness, and her needs supplied, would have sufficed. She would then have thought herself happy in becoming my wife. There would then have been no cruelty. But she had seen you, and though it was but a dream, she thought that she could endure to wait. Better that than surrender all the delight of loving. So she told me that she would think of you. Poor dear! I can understand now the struggle which she intended to make. Then in the very nick of time, in the absolute moment of the day—so that you might have everything and I nothing—you came. You came, and were allowed to see her, and told her all your story. You filled her heart full with joy, but only to be crushed when she thought that the fatal promise had been given to me. I saw it all, I knew it. I thought to myself for a few hours that it might be so. But it cannot be so.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, Mr Whittlestaff!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It cannot be so,\" he said, with a firm determined voice, as though asserting a fact which admitted no doubt. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mr Whittlestaff, what am I to say to you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You! What are you to say? Nothing. What should you say? Why should you speak? It is not for love of you that I would do this thing; nor yet altogether from love of her. Not that I would not do much for her sake. I almost think that I would do it entirely for her sake, if there were no other reason. But to shame myself by taking that which belongs to another, as though it were my own property! To live a coward in mine own esteem! Though I may be the laughing-stock and the butt of all those around me, I would still be a man to myself. I ought to have felt that it was sufficient when she told me that some of her thoughts must still be given to you. She is yours, Mr Gordon; but I doubt much whether you care for the possession.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not care for her! Up to the moment when I received your note, I was about to start again for South Africa. South Africa is no place for her,—nor for me either, with such a wife. Mr Whittlestaff, will you not allow me to say one word to you in friendship?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not a word.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How am I to come and take her out of your house?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She must manage it as best she can. But no; I would not turn her from my door for all the world could do for me. This, too, will be part of the punishment that I must bear. You can settle the day between you, I suppose, and then you can come down; and, after the accustomed fashion, you can meet her at the church-door. Then you can come to my house, and eat your breakfast there if you will. You will see fine things prepared for you,—such as a woman wants on those occasions,—and then you can carry her off wherever you please. I need know nothing of your whereabouts. Good morning now. Do not say anything further, but let me go my way.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2727/75127.html","bookId":1404,"book":{"id":1404,"title":"An Old Man\u0027s Love","description":"简介： Mr William Whittlestaff was strolling very slowly up and down the long walk at his country seat in Hampshire, thinking of the contents of a letter which he held crushed up within his trousers\u0027 pocket.
