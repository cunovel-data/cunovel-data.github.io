{"id":25781,"no":16,"title":"CHAPTER XVI. MRS BAGGETT\u0027S PHILOSOPHY.","content":"The next day was Saturday, and Mr Whittlestaff came out of his room early, intending to speak to Mrs Baggett. He had declared to himself that it was his purpose to give her some sound advice respecting her own affairs,—as far as her affairs and his were connected together. But low down in his mind, below the stratum in which his declared resolution was apparent to himself, there was a hope that he might get from her some comfort and strength as to his present purpose. Not but that he would ultimately do as he himself had determined; but, to tell the truth, he had not quite determined, and thought that a word from Mrs Baggett might assist him. \n \n As he came out from his room, he encountered Mary, intent upon her household duties. It was something before her usual time, and he was surprised. She had looked ill overnight and worn, and he had expected that she would keep her bed. \"What makes you so early, Mary?\" He spoke to her with his softest and most affectionate tone. \n \n \"I couldn\u0027t sleep, and I thought I might as well be up.\" She had followed him into the library, and when there he put his arm round her waist and kissed her forehead. It was a strange thing for him to do. She felt that it was so—very, very strange; but it never occurred to her that it behoved her to be angry at his caress. He had kissed her once before, and only once, and it had seemed to her that he had intended that their love-making should go on without kisses. But was she not his property, to do as he pleased with her? And there could be no ground for displeasure on her part. \n \n \"Dear Mary,\" he said, \"if you could only know how constant my thoughts are to you.\" She did not doubt that it was so; but just so constant were her thoughts to John Gordon. But from her to him there could be no show of affection—nothing but the absolute coldness of perfect silence. She had passed the whole evening with him last night, and had not been allowed to speak a single word to him beyond the ordinary greetings of society. She had felt that she had not been allowed to speak a single word to any one, because he had been present. Mr Whittlestaff had thrown over her the deadly mantle of his ownership, and she had consequently felt herself to be debarred from all right over her own words and actions. She had become his slave; she felt herself in very truth to be a poor creature whose only duty it was in the world to obey his volition. She had told herself during the night that, with all her motives for loving him, she was learning to regard him with absolute hatred. And she hated herself because it was so. Oh, what a tedious affair was this of living! How tedious, how sad and miserable, must her future days be, as long as days should be left to her! Could it be made possible to her that she should ever be able to do her duty by this husband of hers,—for her, in whose heart of hearts would be seated continually the image of this other man? \n \n \"By-the-by,\" said he, \"I want to see Mrs Baggett. I suppose she is about somewhere.\" \n \n \"Oh dear, yes. Since the trouble of her husband has become nearer, she is earlier and earlier every day. Shall I send her?\" Then she departed, and in a few minutes Mrs Baggett entered the room. \n \n \"Come in, Mrs Baggett.\" \n \n \"Yes, sir.\" \n \n \"I have just a few words which I want to say to you. Your husband has gone back to Portsmouth?\" \n \n \"Yes sir; he have.\" This she said in a very decided tone, as though her master need trouble himself no further about her husband. \n \n \"I am very glad that it should be so. It\u0027s the best place for him,—unless he could be sent to Australia.\" \n \n \"He ain\u0027t a-done nothing to fit himself for Botany Bay, Mr Whittlestaff,\" said the old woman, bobbing her head at him. \n \n \"I don\u0027t care what place he has fitted himself for, so long as he doesn\u0027t come here. He is a disreputable old man.\" \n \n \"You needn\u0027t be so hard upon him, Mr Whittlestaff. He ain\u0027t a-done nothing much to you, barring sleeping in the stable one night when he had had a drop o\u0027 drink too much.\" And the old woman pulled out a great handkerchief, and began to wipe her eyes piteously. \n \n \"What a fool you are, Mrs Baggett.\" \n \n \"Yes; I am a fool. I knows that.\" \n \n \"Here\u0027s this disreputable old man eating and drinking your hard-earned wages.\" \n \n \"But they are my wages. And who\u0027s a right to them, only he?\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t say anything about that, only he comes here and disturbs you.\" \n \n \"Well, yes; he is disturbing; if it\u0027s only because of his wooden leg and red nose. I don\u0027t mean to say as he\u0027s the sort of a man as does a credit to a gentleman\u0027s house to see about the place. But he was my lot in matrimony, and I\u0027ve got to put up with him. I ain\u0027t a-going to refuse to bear the burden which came to be my lot. I don\u0027t suppose he\u0027s earned a single shilling since he left the regiment, and that is hard upon a poor woman who\u0027s got nothing but her wages.\" \n \n \"Now, look here, Mrs Baggett.\" \n \n \"Yes, sir.\" \n \n \"Send him your wages.\" \n \n \"And have to go in rags myself,—in your service.\" \n \n \"You won\u0027t go in rags. Don\u0027t be a fool.\" \n \n \"I am a fool, Mr Whittlestaff; you can\u0027t tell me that too often.\" \n \n \"You won\u0027t go in rags. You ought to know us well enough—\" \n \n \"Who is us, Mr Whittlestaff? They ain\u0027t no us;—just yet.\" \n \n \"Well;—me.\" \n \n \"Yes, I know you, Mr Whittlestaff.\" \n \n \"Send him your wages. You may be quite sure that you\u0027ll find yourself provided with shoes and stockings, and the rest of it.\" \n \n \"And be a woluntary burden beyond what I earns! Never;—not as long as Miss Mary is coming to live here as missus of your house. I should do summat as I should have to repent of. But, Mr Whittlestaff, I\u0027ve got to look the world in the face, and bear my own crosses. I never can do it no younger.\" \n \n \"You\u0027re an old woman now, and you talk of throwing yourself upon the world without the means of earning a shilling.\" \n \n \"I think I\u0027d earn some, at something, old as I am, till I fell down flat dead,\" she said. \"I have that sperit in me, that I\u0027d still be doing something. But it don\u0027t signify; I\u0027m not going to remain here when Miss Mary is to be put over me. That\u0027s the long and the short of it all.\" \n \n Now had come the moment in which, if ever, Mr Whittlestaff must get the strength which he required. He was quite sure of the old woman,—that her opinion would not be in the least influenced by any desire on her own part to retain her position as his housekeeper. \"I don\u0027t know about putting Miss Mary over you,\" he said. \n \n \"Don\u0027t know about it!\" she shouted. \n \n \"My mind is not absolutely fixed.\" \n \n \"\u0027As she said anything?\" \n \n \"Not a word.\" \n \n \"Or he? Has he been and dared to speak up about Miss Mary. And he,—who, as far as I can understand, has never done a ha\u0027porth for her since the beginning. What\u0027s Mr Gordon? I should like to know. Diamonds! What\u0027s diamonds in the way of a steady income? They\u0027re all a flash in the pan, and moonshine and dirtiness. I hates to hear of diamonds. There\u0027s all the ill in the world comes from them; and you\u0027d give her up to be taken off by such a one as he among the diamonds! I make bold to tell you, Mr Whittlestaff, that you ought to have more strength of mind than what that comes to. You\u0027re telling me every day as I\u0027m an old fool.\" \n \n \"So you are.\" \n \n \"I didn\u0027t never contradict you; nor I don\u0027t mean, if you tells me so as often again. And I don\u0027t mean to be that impident as to tell my master as I ain\u0027t the only fool about the place. It wouldn\u0027t be no wise becoming.\" \n \n \"But you think it would be true.\" \n \n \"I says nothing about that. That\u0027s not the sort of language anybody has heard to come out of my mouth, either before your face or behind your back. But I do say as a man ought to behave like a man. What! Give up to a chap as spends his time in digging for diamonds! Never!\" \n \n \"What does it matter what he digs for; you know nothing about his business.\" \n \n \"But I know something about yours, Mr Whittlestaff. I know where you have set your wishes. And I know that when a man has made up his mind in such an affair as this, he shouldn\u0027t give way to any young diamond dealer of them all.\" \n \n \"Not to him.\" \n \n \"And what\u0027s she? Are you to give up everything because she\u0027s love-sick for a day or two? Is everything to be knocked to pieces here at Croker\u0027s Hall, because he has come and made eyes at her? She was glad enough to take what you offered before he had come this way.\" \n \n \"She was not glad enough. That is it. She was not glad enough.\" \n \n \"She took you, at any rate, and I\u0027d never make myself mean enough to make way for such a fellow as that.\" \n \n \"It isn\u0027t for him, Mrs Baggett.\" \n \n \"It is for him. Who else? To walk away and just leave the game open because he has come down to Hampshire! There ain\u0027t no spirit of standing up and fighting about it.\" \n \n \"With whom am I to fight?\" \n \n \"With both of \u0027em;—till you have your own way. A foolish, stupid, weak girl like that!\" \n \n \"I won\u0027t have her abused.\" \n \n \"She\u0027s very well. I ain\u0027t a-saying nothing against her. If she\u0027ll do what you bid her, she\u0027ll turn out right enough. You asked her, and she said she\u0027d do it. Is not that so? There\u0027s nothing I hate so much as them romantic ways. And everything is to be made to give way because a young chap is six foot high! I hates romance and manly beauty, as they call it, and all the rest of it. Where is she to get her bread and meat? That\u0027s what I want to know.\" \n \n \"There\u0027ll be bread and meat for her.\" \n \n \"I dare say. But you\u0027ll have to pay for it, while she\u0027s philandering about with him! And that\u0027s what you call fine feelings. I call it all rubbish. If you\u0027ve a mind to make her Mrs Whittlestaff, make her Mrs Whittlestaff. Drat them fine feelings. I never knew no good come of what people call fine feelings. If a young woman does her work as it should be, she\u0027s got no time to think of \u0027em. And if a man is master, he should be master. How\u0027s a man to give way to a girl like that, and then stand up and face the world around him? A man has to be master; and when he\u0027s come to be a little old-like, he has to see that he will be master. I never knew no good come of one of them soft-going fellows who is minded to give up whenever a woman wants anything. What\u0027s a woman? It ain\u0027t natural that she should have her way; and she don\u0027t like a man a bit better in the long-run because he lets her. There\u0027s Miss Mary; if you\u0027re stiff with her now, she\u0027ll come out right enough in a month or two. She\u0027s lived without Mr Gordon well enough since she\u0027s been here. Now he\u0027s come, and we hear a deal about these fine feelings. You take my word, and say nothing to nobody about the young man. He\u0027s gone by this time, or he\u0027s a-going. Let him go, say I; and if Miss Mary takes on to whimper a bit, don\u0027t you see it.\" \n \n Mrs Baggett took her departure, and Mr Whittlestaff felt that he had received the comfort, or at any rate the strength, of which he had been in quest. In all that the woman had said to him, there had been a re-echo of his own thoughts,—of one side, at any rate, of his own thoughts. He knew that true affection, and the substantial comforts of the world, would hold their own against all romance. And he did not believe,—in his theory of ethics he did not believe,—that by yielding to what Mrs Baggett called fine feelings, he would in the long-run do good to those with whom he was concerned in the world. Were he to marry Mary Lawrie now, Mary Whittlestaff would, he thought, in ten years\u0027 time, be a happier woman than were he to leave her. That was the solid conviction of his mind, and in that he had been strengthened by Mrs Baggett\u0027s arguments. He had desired to be so strengthened, and therefore his interview had been successful. \n \n But as the minutes passed by, as every quarter of an hour added itself to the quarters that were gone, and as the hours grew on, and the weakness of evening fell upon him, all his softness came back again. They had dined at six o\u0027clock, and at seven he declared his purpose of strolling out by himself. On these summer evenings he would often take Mary with him; but he now told her, with a sort of apology, that he would rather go alone. \"Do,\" she said, smiling up into his face; \"don\u0027t let me ever be in your way. Of course, a man does not always want to have to find conversation for a young lady.\" \n \n \"If you are the young lady, I should always want it—only that I have things to think of.\" \n \n \"Go and think of your things. I will sit in the garden and do my stitching.\" \n \n About a mile distant, where the downs began to rise, there was a walk supposed to be common to all who chose to frequent it, but which was entered through a gate which gave the place within the appearance of privacy. There was a little lake inside crowded with water-lilies, when the time for the water-lilies had come; and above the lake a path ran up through the woods, very steep, and as it rose higher and higher, altogether sheltered. It was about a mile in length till another gate was reached; but during the mile the wanderer could go off on either side, and lose himself on the grass among the beech-trees. It was a favourite haunt with Mr Whittlestaff. Here he was wont to sit and read his Horace, and think of the affairs of the world as Horace depicted them. Many a morsel of wisdom he had here made his own, and had then endeavoured to think whether the wisdom had in truth been taken home by the poet to his own bosom, or had only been a glitter of the intellect, never appropriated for any useful purpose. \"\u0027Gemmas, marmor, ebur,\u0027\" he had said. \"\u0027Sunt qui non habeant; est qui non curat habere.\u0027 I suppose he did care for jewels, marble, and ivory, as much as any one. \u0027Me lentus Glycer? torret amor me?.\u0027 I don\u0027t suppose he ever loved her really, or any other girl.\" Thus he would think over his Horace, always having the volume in his pocket. \n \n Now he went there. But when he had sat himself down in a spot to which he was accustomed, he had no need to take out his Horace. His own thoughts came to him free enough without any need of his looking for them to poetry. After all, was not Mrs Baggett\u0027s teaching a damnable philosophy? Let the man be the master, and let him get everything he can for himself, and enjoy to the best of his ability all that he can get. That was the lesson as taught by her. But as he sat alone there beneath the trees, he told himself that no teaching was more damnable. Of course it was the teaching by which the world was kept going in its present course; but when divested of its plumage was it not absolutely the philosophy of selfishness? Because he was a man, and as a man had power and money and capacity to do the things after which his heart lusted, he was to do them for his own gratification, let the consequences be what they might to one whom he told himself that he loved! Did the lessons of Mrs Baggett run smoothly with those of Jesus Christ? \n \n Then within his own mind he again took Mrs Baggett\u0027s side of the question. How mean a creature must he not become, if he were now to surrender this girl whom he was anxious to make his wife! He knew of himself that in such a matter he was more sensitive than others. He could not let her go, and then walk forth as though little or nothing were the matter with him. Now for the second time in his life he had essayed to marry. And now for the second time all the world would know that he had been accepted and then rejected. It was, he thought, more than he could endure,—and live. \n \n Then after he had sat there for an hour he got up and walked home; and as he went he tried to resolve that he would reject the philosophy of Mrs Baggett and accept the other. \"If I only knew!\" he said as he entered his own gate. \"If one could only see clearly!\" Then he found Mary still seated in the garden. \"Nothing is to be got,\" he said, \"by asking you for an answer.\" \n \n \"In what have I failed?\" \n \n \"Never mind. Let us go in and have a cup of tea.\" But she knew well in what he accused her of failing, and her heart turned towards him again. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2727/75122.html","bookId":1404,"book":{"id":1404,"title":"An Old Man\u0027s Love","description":"简介： Mr William Whittlestaff was strolling very slowly up and down the long walk at his country seat in Hampshire, thinking of the contents of a letter which he held crushed up within his trousers\u0027 pocket.
