{"id":25776,"no":11,"title":"CHAPTER XI. MRS BAGGETT TRUSTS ONLY IN THE FUNDS.","content":"Mr Whittlestaff, when he was left alone in the long walk, was disturbed by many troublesome thoughts. The knowledge that his housekeeper was out on the road, and that her drunken disreputable husband was playing the fool for the benefit of all the idlers that had sauntered out from Alresford to see him, added something to his grief. Why should not the stupid woman remain indoors, and allow him, her master, to send for the police? She had declared that she would go with her husband, and he could not violently prevent her. This was not much when added to the weight of his care as to Mary Lawrie, but it seemed to be the last ounce destined to break the horse\u0027s back, as is the proverbial fate of all last ounces. \\n\\n \\n\\n Just as he was about to collect his thoughts, so as to resolve what it might be his duty to do in regard to Mary, Mrs Baggett appeared before him on the walk with her bonnet on her head. \"What are you going to do, you stupid woman?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am a-going with he,\" she said, in the midst of a torrent of sobs and tears. \"It\u0027s a dooty. They says if you does your dooty all will come right in the end. It may be, but I don\u0027t see it no further than taking him back to Portsmouth.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What on earth are you going to Portsmouth for now? And why? why now? He\u0027s not more drunk than he has been before, nor yet less abominable. Let the police lock him up for the night, and send him back to Portsmouth in the morning. Why should you want to go with him now?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Because you\u0027re going to take a missus,\" said Mrs Baggett, still sobbing. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s more than I know; or you know; or anyone knows,\" and Mr Whittlestaff spoke as though he had nearly reduced himself to his housekeeper\u0027s position. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not marry her!\" she exclaimed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I cannot say. If you will let me alone to manage my own affairs, it will be best.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That man has been here interfering. You don\u0027t mean to say that you\u0027re going to be put upon by such a savage as that, as has just come home from South Africa. Diamonds, indeed! I\u0027d diamond him! I don\u0027t believe, not in a single diamond. They\u0027re all rubbish and paste. If you\u0027re going to give her up to that fellow, you\u0027re not the gentleman I take you for.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But if I don\u0027t marry you won\u0027t have to go,\" he said, unable to refrain from so self-evident an argument. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Me going! What\u0027s me going? What\u0027s me or that drunken old reprobate out there to the likes of you? I\u0027d stay, only if it was to see that Mr John Gordon isn\u0027t let to put his foot here in this house; and then I\u0027d go. John Gordon, indeed! To come up between you and her, when you had settled your mind and she had settled hern! If she favours John Gordon, I\u0027ll tear her best frock off her back.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How dare you speak in that way of the lady who is to be your mistress?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She ain\u0027t to be my mistress. I won\u0027t have no mistress. When her time is come, I shall be in the poorhouse at Portsmouth, because I shan\u0027t be able to earn a penny to buy gin for him.\" As she said this, Mrs Baggett sobbed bitterly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027re enough to drive a man mad. I don\u0027t know what it is you want, or you don\u0027t want.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I wishes to see Miss Lawrie do her dooty, and become your wife, as a lady should do. You wishes it, and she ought to wish it too. Drat her! If she is going back from her word—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She is not going back from her word. Nothing is more excellent, nothing more true, nothing more trustworthy than Miss Lawrie. You should not allow yourself to speak of her in such language.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is it you, then, as is going back?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I do not know. To tell the truth, Mrs Baggett, I do not know.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then let me tell you, sir. I\u0027m an old woman whom you\u0027ve known all your life pretty nigh, and you can trust me. Don\u0027t give up to none of \u0027em. You\u0027ve got her word, and keep her to it. What\u0027s the good o\u0027 your fine feelings if you\u0027re to break your heart. You means well by her, and will make her happy. Can you say as much for him? When them diamonds is gone, what\u0027s to come next? I ain\u0027t no trust in diamonds, not to live out of, but only in the funds, which is reg\u0027lar. I wouldn\u0027t let her see John Gordon again,—never, till she was Mrs Whittlestaff. After that she\u0027ll never go astray; nor yet won\u0027t her thoughts.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"God bless you! Mrs Baggett,\" he said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She\u0027s one of them when she\u0027s your own she\u0027ll remain your own all out. She\u0027ll stand the washing. I\u0027m an old woman, and I knows \u0027em.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And yet you cannot live with such a lady as her?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No! if she was one of them namby-pambys as\u0027d let an old woman keep her old place, it might do.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She shall love you always for what you said just now.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Love me! I don\u0027t doubt her loving me. She\u0027ll love me because she is loving—not that I am lovable. She\u0027ll want to do a\u0027most everything about the house, and I shall want the same; and her wants are to stand uppermost,—that is, if she is to be Mrs Whittlestaff.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I do not know; I have to think about it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t think about it no more; but just go in and do it. Don\u0027t have no more words with him nor yet with her,—nor yet with yourself. Let it come on just as though it were fixed by fate. It\u0027s in your own hands now, sir, and don\u0027t you be thinking of being too good-natured; there ain\u0027t no good comes from it. A man may maunder away his mind in softnesses till he ain\u0027t worth nothing, and don\u0027t do no good to no one. You can give her bread to eat, and clothes to wear, and can make her respectable before all men and women. What has he to say? Only that he is twenty years younger than you. Love! Rot it! I suppose you\u0027ll come in just now, sir, and see my boxes when they\u0027re ready to start.\" So saying, she turned round sharply on the path and left him. \\n\\n \\n\\n In spite of the excellent advice which Mr Whittlestaff had received from his housekeeper, bidding him not have any more words even with himself on the matter, he could not but think of all the arguments which John Gordon had used to him. According to Mrs Baggett, he ought to content himself with knowing that he could find food and raiment and shelter for his intended wife, and also in feeling that he had her promise, and her assurance that that promise should be respected. There was to him a very rock in all this, upon which he could build his house with absolute safety. And he did not believe of her that, were he so to act, she would turn round upon him with future tears or neglect her duty, because she was ever thinking of John Gordon. He knew that she would be too steadfast for all that, and that even though there might be some sorrow at her heart, it would be well kept down, out of his sight, out of the sight of the world at large, and would gradually sink out of her own sight too. But if it be given to a man \"to maunder away his mind in softnesses,\" he cannot live otherwise than as nature has made him. Such a man must maunder. Mrs Baggett had understood accurately the nature of his character; but had not understood that, as was his character, so must he act. He could not alter his own self. He could not turn round upon himself, and bid himself be other than he was. It is necessary to be stern and cruel and determined, a man shall say to himself. In this particular emergency of my life I will be stern and cruel. General good will come out of such a line of conduct. But unless he be stern and cruel in other matters also,—unless he has been born stern and cruel, or has so trained himself,—he cannot be stern and cruel for that occasion only. All this Mr Whittlestaff knew of himself. As sure as he was there thinking over John Gordon and Mary Lawrie, would he maunder away his mind in softnesses. He feared it of himself, was sure of it of himself, and hated himself because it was so. \\n\\n \\n\\n He did acknowledge to himself the truth of the position as asserted by John Gordon. Had the man come but a day earlier, he would have been in time to say the first word; and then, as Mr Whittlestaff said to himself, there would not for him have been a chance. And in such case there would have been no reason, as far as Mr Whittlestaff could see, why John Gordon should be treated other than as a happy lover. It was the one day in advance which had given him the strength of his position. But it was the one day also which had made him weak. He had thought much about Mary for some time past. He had told himself that by her means might be procured some cure to the wound in his heart which had made his life miserable for so many years. But had John Gordon come in time, the past misery would only have been prolonged, and none would have been the wiser. Even Mrs Baggett would have held her peace, and not thrown it in his teeth that he had attempted to marry the girl and had failed. As it was, all the world of Alresford would know how it had been with him, and all the world of Alresford as they looked at him would tell themselves that this was the man who had attempted to marry Mary Lawrie, and had failed. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was all true,—all that John Gordon alleged on his own behalf. But then he was able to salve his own conscience by telling himself that when John Gordon had run through his diamonds, there would be nothing but poverty and distress. There was no reason for supposing that the diamonds would be especially short-lived, or that John Gordon would probably be a spendthrift. But diamonds as a source of income are volatile,—not trustworthy, as were the funds to Mrs Baggett. And then the nature of the source of income offered, enabled him to say so much as a plea to himself. Could he give the girl to a man who had nothing but diamonds with which to pay his weekly bills? He did tell himself again and again, that Mary Lawrie should not be encouraged to put her faith in diamonds. But he felt that it was only an excuse. In arguing the matter backwards and forwards, he could not but tell himself that he did believe in John Gordon. \\n\\n \\n\\n And then an idea, a grand idea, but one very painful in its beauty, crept into his mind. Even though these diamonds should melt away, and become as nothing, there was his own income, fixed and sure as the polar star, in the consolidated British three per cents. If he really loved this girl, could he not protect her from poverty, even were she married to a John Gordon, broken down in the article of his diamonds? If he loved her, was he not bound, by some rule of chivalry which he could not define even to himself, to do the best he could for her happiness? He loved her so well that he thought that, for her sake, he could abolish himself. Let her have his money, his house, and his horses. Let her even have John Gordon. He could with a certain feeling of delight imagine it all. But then he could not abolish himself. There he would be, subject to the remarks of men. \"There is he,\" men would say of him, \"who has maundered away his mind in softnesses;—who in his life has loved two girls, and has, at last, been thrown over by both of them because he has been no better than a soft maundering idiot.\" It would be thus that his neighbours would speak of him in his vain effort to abolish himself. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was not yet too late. He had not yielded an inch to this man. He could still be stern and unbending. He felt proud of himself in that he had been stern and unbending, as far as the man was concerned. And as regarded Mary, he did feel sure of her. If there was to be weakness displayed, it would be in himself. Mary would be true to her promise;—true to her faith, true to the arrangement made for her own life. She would not provoke him with arguments as to her love for John Gordon; and, as Mrs Baggett had assured him, even in her thoughts she would not go astray. If it were but for that word, Mrs Baggett should not be allowed to leave his house. \\n\\n \\n\\n But what as to Mary\u0027s love? Any such question was maunderingly soft. It was not for him to ask it. He did believe in her altogether, and was perfectly secure that his name and his honour were safe in her hands. And she certainly would learn to love him. \"She\u0027ll stand the washing,\" he said to himself, repeating another morsel of Mrs Baggett\u0027s wisdom. And thus he made up his mind that he would, on this occasion, if only on this occasion, be stern and cruel. Surely a man could bring himself to sternness and cruelty for once in his life, when so much depended on it. \\n\\n \\n\\n Having so resolved, he walked back into the house, intending to see Mary Lawrie, and so to speak to her as to give her no idea of the conversation which had taken place between him and John Gordon. It would not be necessary, he thought, that he should mention to her John Gordon\u0027s name any more. Let his marriage go on, as though there were no such person as John Gordon. It would be easier to be stern and cruel when he could enact the character simply by silence. He would hurry on his wedding as quickly as she would allow him, and then the good thing—the good that was to come out of sternness and cruelty—would be achieved. \\n\\n \\n\\n He went through from the library to knock at Mary\u0027s door, and in doing so, had to pass the room in which Mrs Baggett had slept tranquilly for fifteen years. There, in the doorway, was a big trunk, and in the lock of the door was a key. A brilliant idea at once occurred to Mr Whittlestaff. He shoved the big box in with his foot, locked the door, and put the key in his pocket. At that moment the heads of the gardener and the groom appeared up the back staircase, and after them Mrs Baggett. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, Mrs Baggett, the door is locked!\" said the gardener. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is, to be sure,\" said the groom. \"Why, Mrs Baggett, you must have the key in your own pocket!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I ain\u0027t got no such thing. Do you bring the box down with you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have got the key in my pocket,\" said Mr Whittlestaff, in a voice of much authority. \"You may both go down. Mrs Baggett\u0027s box is not to be taken out of that room to-day.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not taken out! Oh, Mr Whittlestaff! Why, the porter is here with his barrow to take it down to the station.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then the porter must have a shilling and go back again empty.\" And so he stalked on, to bid Miss Lawrie come to him in the library. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I never heard of such a go in all my life;—and he means it, too,\" said Thornybush, the gardener. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I never quite know what he means,\" said Hayonotes, the groom; \"but he\u0027s always in earnest, whatever it is. I never see one like the master for being in earnest. But he\u0027s too deep for me in his meaning. I suppose we is only got to go back.\" So they retreated down the stairs, leaving Mrs Baggett weeping in the passage. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You should let a poor old woman have her box,\" she said, whining to her master, whom she followed to the library. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No; I won\u0027t! You shan\u0027t have your box. You\u0027re an old fool!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I know I\u0027m an old fool;—but I ought to have my box.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You won\u0027t have it. You may just go down and get your dinner. When you want to go to bed, you shall have the key.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I ought to have my box, Miss Mary. It\u0027s my own box. What am I to do with Baggett? They have given him more gin out there, and he\u0027s as drunk as a beast. I think I ought to have my own box. Shall I tell Thornybush as he may come back? The train\u0027ll be gone, and then what am I to do with Baggett? He\u0027ll get hisself that drunk, you won\u0027t be able to stir him. And it is my own box, Mr Whittlestaff?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n To all which Mr Whittlestaff turned a deaf ear. She should find that there was no maundering softness with him now. He felt within his own bosom that it behoved him to learn to become stern and cruel. He knew that the key was in his pocket, and found that there was a certain satisfaction in being stern and cruel. Mrs Baggett might sob her heart out after her box, and he would decline to be moved. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What\u0027ll I do about Baggett, sir?\" said the poor woman, coming back. \"He\u0027s a lying there at the gate, and the perlice doesn\u0027t like to touch him because of you, sir. He says as how if you could take him into the stables, he\u0027d sleep it off among the straw. But then he\u0027d be just as bad after this first go, to-morrow.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n To this, however, Mr Whittlestaff at once acceded. He saw a way out of the immediate difficulty. He therefore called Hayonotes to him, and succeeded in explaining his immediate meaning. Hayonotes and the policeman between them lifted Baggett, and deposited the man in an empty stall, where he was accommodated with ample straw. And an order was given that as soon as he had come to himself, he should be provided with something to eat. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Summat to eat!\" said Mrs Baggett, in extreme disgust. \"Provide him with a lock-up and plenty of cold water!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2727/75117.html","bookId":1404,"book":{"id":1404,"title":"An Old Man\u0027s Love","description":"简介： Mr William Whittlestaff was strolling very slowly up and down the long walk at his country seat in Hampshire, thinking of the contents of a letter which he held crushed up within his trousers\u0027 pocket.
