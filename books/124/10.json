{"id":3281,"no":10,"title":"CHAPTER NINE HYPERSPACE","content":"TREVIZE SAID, \"ARE YOU READY, JANOV?\" Pelorat looked up from the book he was viewing and said, \"You mean, for the jump, old fellow?\" \"For the hyperspatial jump. Yes.\" Pelorat swallowed. \"Now, you\u0027re sure that it will be in no way uncomfortable. I know it is a silly thing to fear, but the thought of having myself reduced to incorporeal tachyons, which no one has ever seen or detected-\" \"Come, Janov, it\u0027s a perfected thing. Upon my honor! The jump has been in use for twenty-two thousand years, as you explained, and I\u0027ve never beard of a single fatality in hyperspace. We might come out of hyperspace in an uncomfortable place, but then the accident would happen in space-not while we are composed of tachyons.\" \"Small consolation, it seems to me.\" \"We won\u0027t come out in error, either. To tell you the truth, I was thinking of carrying it through without telling you, so that you would never know it had happened. On the whole, though, I felt it would be better if you experienced it consciously, saw that it was no problem of any kind, and could forget it totally henceforward.\" \"Well \" said Pelorat dubiously. \"I suppose you\u0027re right, but \u0027honestly I\u0027m in no hurry.\" \"I assure you-\" \"No no, old fellow, I accept your assurances unequivocally. It\u0027s just that - Did you ever read Sanertestil Matt?\" \"Of course. I\u0027m not illiterate.\" \"Certainly. Certainly. I should not have asked. Do you remember it?\" \"Neither am I an amnesiac.\" \"I seem to have a talent for offending. All I mean is that I keep thinking of the scenes where Santerestil and his friend, Ban, have gotten away from Planet 17 and are lost in space. I think of those perfectly hypnotic scenes among the stars, lazily moving along in deep silence, in changelessness, in- Never believed it, you know. I loved it and I was moved by it, but I never really believed it. But now-after I got used to just the notion of being in space, I\u0027m experiencing it and-it\u0027s silly, I know-but I don\u0027t want to give it up. It\u0027s as though I\u0027m Santerestil-\" \"And I\u0027m Ban,\" said Trevize with just an edge of impatience. \"In a way. The small scattering of dim stars out there are motionless, except our sun, of course, which must be shrinking but which we don\u0027t see. The Galaxy retains its dim majesty, unchanging. Space is silent and I have no distractions-\" \"Except me.\" \"Except you. -But then, Golan, dear chap, talking to you about Earth and trying to teach you a bit of prehistory has its pleasures, too. I don\u0027t want that to come to an end, either.\" \"It won\u0027t. Not immediately, at any rate. You don\u0027t suppose we\u0027ll take the jump and come through on the surface of a planet, do you? We\u0027ll still be in space and the jump will have taken no measurable time at ail. It may well be a week before we make surface of any kind, so do relax.\" \"By surface, you surely don\u0027t mean Gaia. We may be nowhere near Gaia when we come out of the jump.\" \"I know that, Janov, but we\u0027ll be in the right sector, if your information is correct. If it isn\u0027t-well-\" Pelorat shook his head glumly. \"How will being in the right sector help if we don\u0027t know Gaia\u0027s co-ordinates?\" Trevize said, \"Janov, suppose you were on Terminus, heading for the town of Argyropol, and you didn\u0027t know where that town was except that it was somewhere on the isthmus. Once you were on the isthmus, what would you do?\" Pelorat waited cautiously, as though feeling there must be a terribly sophisticated answer expected of him. Finally giving up, he said, \"I suppose I\u0027d ask somebody.\" \"Exactly! What else is there to do? -Now, are you ready?\" \"You mean, now?\" Pelorat scrambled to his feet, his pleasantly unemotional face coming as near as it might to a look of concern. \"What am I supposed to do? Sit? Stand? What?\" \"Time and Space, Pelorat, you don\u0027t do anything. Just come with me to my room so I can use the computer, then sit or stand or turn cartwheels-whatever will make you most comfortable. My suggestion is that you sit before the viewscreen and watch it. It\u0027s sure to be interesting. Come!\" They stepped along the short corridor to Trevize\u0027s room and he seated himself at the computer. \"Would you like to do this, Janov?\" he asked suddenly. \"I\u0027ll give you the figures and all you do is think them. The computer will do the rest.\" Pelorat said, \"No thank you. The computer doesn\u0027t work well with me, somehow. I know you say I just need practice, but I don\u0027t believe that. There\u0027s something about your mind, Golan-\" \"Don\u0027t be foolish.\" \"No no. That computer just seems to fit you. You and it seem to be a single organism when you\u0027re hooked up. When I\u0027m hooked up, there are two objects involved-Janov Pelorat and a computer. It\u0027s just not the same.\" \"Ridiculous,\" said Trevize, but he was vaguely pleased at the thought and stroked the hand-rests of the computer with loving fingertips. \"So I\u0027d rather watch,\" said Pelorat. \"I mean, I\u0027d rather it didn\u0027t happen at all, but as long as it will, I\u0027d rather watch.\" He fixed . his eyes anxiously on the viewscreen and on the foggy Galaxy with the thin powdering of dim stars in the foreground. \"Let me know when it\u0027s about to happen.\" Slowly he backed against the wall and braced himself. Trevize smiled. He placed his hands on the rests and felt the mental union. It came more easily day by day, and more intimately, too, and however he might scoff at what Pelorat said-he actually felt it. It seemed to him he scarcely needed to think of the co-ordinates in any conscious way. It almost seemed the computer knew what he wanted, without the conscious process of \"telling.\" It lifted the information out of his brain for itself. But Trevize \"told\" it and then asked for a two-minute interval before the jump. \"All right, Janov. We have two minutes: 120 - 115 - 110 Just watch the viewscreen.\" Pelorat did, with a slight tightness about the corners of his mouth and with a holding of his breath. Trevize said softly, \"15 - 10 - 5 - 4 - 3 - Z - 1 - o \" With no perceptible motion, no perceptible sensation, the view on the screen changed. There was a distinct thickening of the starfield and the Galaxy vanished. Pelorat started and said, \"Was that it?\" \"Was what it? You flinched. But that was your fault. You felt nothing. Admit it.\" \"I admit it.\" \"Then that\u0027s it. Way back when hyperspatial travel was relatively new - according to the books, anyway-there would be a queer internal sensation and some people felt dizziness or nausea. It was perhaps psychogenic, perhaps not. In any case, with more and more experience with hyperspatiality and with better equipment, that decreased. With a computer like the one on board this vessel, any effect is well below the threshold of sensation. At least, I find it so.\" \"And I do, too, I must admit. Where are we, Golan?\" \"Just a step forward. In the Kalganian region. There\u0027s a long way to go yet and before we make another move, we\u0027ll have to check the accuracy of the jump.\" \"What bothers me is-where\u0027s the Galaxy?\" \"All around us, Janov. We\u0027re weal inside it, now. If we focus the viewscreen properly, we can see the more distant parts of it as a luminous band across the sky.\" \"The Milky Way!\" Pelorat cried out joyfully. \"Almost every world describes it in their sky, but it\u0027s something we don\u0027t see on Terminus. Show it to me, old fellow!\" The viewscreen tilted, giving the effect of a swimming of the starfield across it, and then there was a thick, pearly luminosity nearly filling the field. The screen followed it around, as it thinned, then swelled again. Trevize said, \"It\u0027s thicker in the direction of the center of the Galaxy. Not as thick or as bright as it might be, however, because of the dark clouds in the spiral arms. You see something like this from most inhabited worlds.\" \"And from Earth, too.\" \"That\u0027s no distinction. That would not be an identifying characteristic.\" \"Of course not. But you know- You haven\u0027t studied the history of science, have you?\" \"Not really, though I\u0027ve picked up some of it, naturally. Still, if you have questions to ask, don\u0027t expect me to be an expert.\" \"It\u0027s just that making this jump has put me in mind of something that has always puzzled me. It\u0027s possible to work out a description of the Universe in which hyperspatial travel is impossible and in which the speed of light traveling through a vacuum is the absolute maximum where speed is concerned.\" \"Certainly.\" \"Under those conditions, the geometry of the Universe is such that it is impossible to make the trip we have just undertaken in less time than a ray of light would make it. And if we did it at the speed of light, our experience of duration would not match that of the Universe generally. If this spot is, say, forty parsecs from Terminus, then if we had gotten here at the speed of light, we would have felt no time lapse-but on Terminus and in the entire Galaxy, about a hundred and thirty years would have passed. Now we have made a trip, not at the speed of light but at thousands of times the speed of light actually, and there has been no time advance anywhere. At least, I hope not.\" Trevize said, \"Don\u0027t expect me to give you the mathematics of the Olanjen Hyperspatial Theory to you. All I can say is that if you had traveled at the speed of light within normal space, time would indeed have advanced at the rate of 3.26 years per parsec, as you described. The so-called relativistic Universe, which humanity has understood as far back as we can probe inter prehistory-though that\u0027s your department, I think-remains, and its laws have not been repealed. In our hyperspatial jumps, however, we do something out side the conditions under which relativity operates and the rules are different. Hyperspatially the Galaxy is a tiny object-ideally a nondimensional dot-and there are no relativistic effects at all. \"In fact, in the mathematical formulations of cosmology, there are two symbols for the Galaxy: Gr for the \"relativistic Galaxy,\" where the speed of light is a maximum, and Gh for the \"hyperspatial Galaxy,\" where speed does not really have a meaning. Hyperspatially the value of all speed is zero and we do not move with reference to space itself, speed is infinite. I can\u0027t explain things a bit more than that. \"Oh, except that one of the beautiful catches in theoretical physics is to place a symbol or a value that has meaning in Gr into an equation dealing with G11-or vice versa-and leave it there for a student to deal with. The chances are enormous that the student falls into the trap and generally remains there, sweating and panting, with nothing seeming to work, till some kindly elder helps him out. I was neatly caught that way, once.\" Pelorat considered that gravely for a while, then said in a perplexed sort of way, \"But which is the true Galaxy?\" \"Either, depending on what you\u0027re doing. If you\u0027re back on Terminus, you can use a car to cover distance on land and a ship to cover distance across the sea. Conditions are different in every way, so which is the true Terminus, the land or the sea?\" Pelorat nodded. \"Analogies are always risky,\" he said, \"but I\u0027d rather accept that one than risk my sanity by thinking about hyperspace any further. I\u0027ll concentrate on what we\u0027re doing now.\" \"Look upon what we just did,\" said Trevize, \"as our first stop toward Earth.\" And, he thought to himself, toward what else, I wonder. \"Well,\" said Trevize. \"I\u0027ve wasted a day.\" \"Oh?\" Pelorat looked up from his careful indexing. \"In what way?\" Trevize spread his arms. \"I didn\u0027t trust the computer. I didn\u0027t dare to, so I checked our present position with the position we had aimed at in the jump. The difference was not measurable. There was no detectable error.\" \"That\u0027s good, isn\u0027t it?\" \"It\u0027s more than good. It\u0027s unbelievable. I\u0027ve never heard of such a thing. I\u0027ve gone through jumps and I\u0027ve directed them, in all kinds of ways and with all kinds of devices. In school, I had to work one out with a hand computer and then I sent off a hyper-relay to check results. Naturally I couldn\u0027t send a real ship, since-aside from the expense-I could easily have placed it in the middle of a star at the other end. \"I never did anything that bad, of course,\" Trevize went on, \"but there would always be a sizable error. There\u0027s always some error, even with experts. There\u0027s got to be, since there are so many variables. Put it this way-the geometry of space is too complicated to handle and hyperspace compounds all those complications with a complexity of its own that we can\u0027t even pretend to understand. That\u0027s why we have to go by steps, instead of making one big jump from here to Sayshell. The errors would grow worse with distance.\" Pelorat said, \"But you said this computer didn\u0027t make an error.\" \"It said it didn\u0027t make an error. I directed it to check our actual position with our precalculated position-`what is\u0027 against `what was asked for.\u0027 It said that the two were identical within its limits of measurement and I thought: What if it\u0027s lying?\" Until that moment, Pelorat had held his printer in his hand. He now put it down and looked shaken. \"Are you joking? A computer can\u0027t lie. Unless you mean you thought it might be out of order.\" \"No, that\u0027s not what I thought. Space! I thought it was lying. This computer is so advanced I can\u0027t think of it as anything but human - superhuman, maybe. Human enough to have pride-and to lie, perhaps. I gave it directions-to work out a course through hyperspace to a position near Sayshell Planet, the capital of the Sayshell union. It did, and charted a course in twenty-nine steps, which is arrogance of the worst sort.\" \"Why arrogance?\" \"The error in the first jump makes the second jump that much less certain, and the added error then makes the third jump pretty wobbly and untrustworthy, and so on. How do you calculate twenty-nine steps all at once? The twenty-ninth could end up anywhere in the Galaxy, anywhere at all. So I directed it to make the first step only. Then we could check that before proceeding.\" \"The cautious approach,\" said Pelorat warmly. \"I approve!\" \"Yes, but having made the first step, might the computer not feel wounded at my having mistrusted it? Would it then be forced to salve its pride by telling me there was no error at all when I asked it? Would it find it impossible to admit a mistake, to own up to imperfection? If that were so, we might as well not have a computer.\" Pelorat\u0027s long and gentle face saddened. \"What can we do in that case, Golan?\" \"We can do what I did-waste a day. I checked the position of several of the surrounding stars by the most primitive possible methods: telescopic observation, photography, and manual measurement. I compared each actual position with the position expected if there had been no error. The work of it took me all day and wore me down to nothing.\" \"Yes, but what happened?\" \"I found two whopping errors and checked them over and found them in my calculations. I had made the mistakes myself. I corrected the calculations, then ran them through the computer from scratch-just to see if it would come up with the same answers independently. Except that it worked them out to several more decimal places, it turned out that my figures were right and they showed that the computer had made no errors. The computer may be an arrogant son-of-the-Mule, but it\u0027s got something to be arrogant about.\" Pelorat exhaled a long breath. \"Well, that\u0027s good.\" \"Yes indeed! So I\u0027m going to let it take the other twenty-eight steps.\" \"All at once? But-\" \"Not all at once. Don\u0027t worry. I haven\u0027t become a daredevil just yet. It will do them one after the other-but after each step it will check the surroundings and, if that is where it is supposed to be within tolerable limits, it can take the next one. Any time it finds the error too great-and, believe me, I didn\u0027t set the limits generously at all-it will have to stop and recalculate the remaining steps.\" \"When are you going to do this?\" \"When? Right now. -Look, you\u0027re working on indexing your Library-\" \"Oh, but this is the chance to do it, Golan. I\u0027ve been meaning to do it for years, but something always seemed to get in the way.\" \"I have no objections. You go on and do it and don\u0027t worry. Concentrate on the indexing. I\u0027ll take care of everything else.\" Pelorat shook his head. \"Don\u0027t be foolish. I can\u0027t relax till this is over. I\u0027m scared stiff.\" \"I shouldn\u0027t have told you, then-but I had to tell someone and you\u0027re the only one here. Let me explain frankly. There\u0027s always the chance that we\u0027ll come to rest in a perfect position in interstellar space and that that will happen to be the precise position which a speeding meteoroid is occupying, or a mini-black hole, and the ship is wrecked, and ;we\u0027re dead. Such things could-in theory - happen. \"The chances are very small, however. After all, you could be at home, Janov - in your study and working on your films or in your bed sleeping-and a meteroid could be streaking toward you through Terminus\u0027s atmosphere and hit you right in the head and you\u0027d be dead. But the chances are small. \"In fact, the chance of intersecting the path of something fatal, but too small for the computer to know about, in the course of a hyperspatial jump is far, far smaller than that of berg hit by a meteor in your home. I\u0027ve never heard of a ship being lost that way in all the history of hyperspatial travel. Any other type of risk-like ending in the middle of a star-is even smaller.\" Pelorat said, \"Then why do you tell me all this, Golan?\" Trevize paused, then bent his head in thought, and finally said, \"I don\u0027t know. -Yes, I do. What I suppose it is, is that however small the chance of catastrophe might be, i€ enough people take enough chances, the catastrophe must happen eventually. No matter how sure I am that nothing will go wrong, there\u0027s a small nagging voice inside me that says, `Maybe it will happen this time.\u0027 And it makes me feel guilty. -I guess that\u0027s it. Janov, if something goes wrong, forgive me!\" \"But Golan, my dear chap, if something goes wrong, we will both be dead instantly. I will not be able to forgive, nor you to receive forgiveness.\" \"I understand that, so forgive me now, will you?\" Pelorat smiled. \"I don\u0027t know why, but this cheers me up. There\u0027s something pleasantly humorous about it. Of course, Golan, I\u0027ll forgive you. There are plenty of myths about some form of afterlife in world literature and if there should happen to be such a place - about the same chance as landing on a mini-black hole, I suppose, or less-and we both turn up in the same one, then I will bear witness that you did your honest best and that my death should not be laid at your door.\" \"Thank you! Now I\u0027m relieved. I\u0027m willing to take my chance, but I did not enjoy the thought of you taking my chance as well.\" Pelorat wrung the other\u0027s hand. \"You know, Golan, I\u0027ve only known you less than a week and I suppose I shouldn\u0027t make hasty judgments in these matters, but I think you\u0027re an excellent chap. -And now let\u0027s do it and get it over with.\" \"Absolutely! All I have to do is touch that little contact. The computer has its instructions and it\u0027s just waiting for me to say: `Starts\u0027 Would you like to-\" \"Never! It\u0027s all yours? It\u0027s your computer.\" \"Very well. And it\u0027s my responsibility. I\u0027m still trying to duck it, you see. Keep your eye on the screen!\" With a remarkably steady hand and with his smile looking utterly genuine, Trevize made contact. There was a momentary pause and then the starfield changed-and again-and again. The stars spread steadily thicker and brighter over the viewscreen. Pelorat was counting under his breath. At \"15\" there was a halt, as though some piece of apparatus had jammed. Pelorat whispered, clearly afraid that any noise might jar the mechanism fatally. \"What\u0027s wrong? What\u0027s happened?\" Trevize shrugged. \"I imagine it\u0027s recalculating. Some object in space is adding a perceptible bump to the general shape of the overall gravitational field-some object not taken into account-some uncharted dwarf star or rogue planet-\" \"Dangerous?\" \"Since we\u0027re still alive, it\u0027s almost certainly not dangerous. A planet could be a hundred million kilometers away and still introduce a large enough gravitational modification to require recalculation. A dwarf star could be ten billion kilometers away and-\" The screen shifted again and Trevize fell silent. It shifted again-and again- Finally, when Pelorat said, \"a8,\" there was no further motion. Trevize consulted the computer. \"We\u0027re here,\" he said. \"I counted the first jump as `r.\u0027 and in this series I started with `z: That\u0027s twenty-eight jumps altogether. You said twenty-nine.\" \"The recalculation at jump i5 probably saved us one jump. I can check with the computer if you wish, but there\u0027s really no need. We\u0027re in the vicinity of Sayshell Planet. The computer says so and I don\u0027t doubt it. If I were to orient the screen properly, we\u0027d see a nice, bright sun, but there\u0027s no point in placing a needless strain on its screening capacity. SaysheIl Planet is the fourth one out and it\u0027s about 3.2 million kilometers away from our present position, which is about as close as we want to be at a jump conclusion. We can get there in three days-two, if we hurry.\" Trevize drew a deep breath and tried to let the tension drain. \"Do you realize what this means, Janov?\" he said. \"Every ship I\u0027ve ever been in-or heard of-would have made those jumps with at least a day in between for painstaking calculation and re-checking, even with a computer. The trip would have taken nearly a month. \"Or perhaps two or three weeks, if they were willing to be reckless about it. We did it in half an hour. When every ship is equipped with a computer like this one-\" Pelorat said, \"I wonder why the Mayor\u0027 let us have a ship this advanced. It must be incredibly expensive.\" \"It\u0027s experimental,\" said Trevize dryly. \"Maybe fine good woman was perfectly willing to have us try it out and see what deficiencies might develop.\" \"Are you serious?\" \"Don\u0027t get nervous. After all, there\u0027s nothing to worry about. We haven\u0027t found any deficiencies. I wouldn\u0027t put it past her, though. Such a thing would put no great strain on her sense of humanity. Besides, she hasn\u0027t trusted us with offensive weapons and that cuts the expense considerably.\" Pelorat said thoughtfully, \"It\u0027s the computer I\u0027m thinking about. It seems to be adjusted so well for you-and it can\u0027t be adjusted that well for everyone. It just barely works with me.\" \"So much the better for us, that it works so well with one of us.\" \"Yes, but is that merely chance?\" \"What else, Janov?\" \"Surely the Mayor knows you pretty well.\" \"I think she does, the old battlecraft.\" \"Might she not have had a computer designed particularly for you?\" \"I just wonder if we\u0027re not going where the computer wants to take us.\" Trevize stared. \"You mean that while I\u0027m connected to the computer, it is the computer-and not me-who is in real charge?\" \"I just wonder.\" \"That is ridiculous. Paranoid. Come on, Janov.\" Trevize turned back to the computer to focus Sayshell Planet on the screen and to plot a normal-space course to it. Ridiculous! But why had Pelorat put the notion into his head?","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1626/48145.html","bookId":124,"book":{"id":124,"title":"基地系列 Foundation\u0027s Edge 基地边缘","description":"简介： 基地纪元498年，两名基地公民登上最先进的太空艇，准备进行一次极不寻常的银河之旅。表面上，他们将寻找传说中的人类原乡，实际的任务，则是要证明第二基地依旧存在。与此同时，银河中又出现神秘的第三方势力。他们神出鬼没，似乎能控制一切，甚至连谢顿计划，好像也在...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201608/18/10-55-14-66-1.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1626","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM"}}
