If your dog moves in my direction, it\u0027s the end for him.\"\n \"Don\u0027t hurt Mutt. Please!\"\n Bigman was taken aback by the sudden anguish in the other\u0027s voice. He said, \"Just keep him quiet then and come with me and no one will be hurt. We\u0027ll go see Lucky. And if we pass anyone in the corridor, don\u0027t you say anything but \u0027Good day.\u0027 I\u0027ll be right beside you, you know.\"\n Norrich said, \"I can\u0027t go without Mutt.\"\n \"Sure you can,\" said Bigman. \"It\u0027s only five steps down the corridor. Even if you were really blind, you could manage that-a fellow who can do threedees and all.\"\n Lucky lifted the viewer from his head at the sound of the door opening and said, \"Good day, Norrich. Where\u0027s Mutt?\"\n Bigman spoke before the other had a chance to answer. \"Mutt\u0027s in Norrich\u0027s room, and Norrich doesn\u0027t need him. Sands of Mars. Lucky, Norrich isn\u0027t any blinder than we are!\"\n \"What?\"\n Norrich began, \"Your friend is quite mistaken, Mr. Starr. I want to say-\"\n Bigman snapped. \"Quiet, you! I\u0027ll talk, and then when you\u0027re invited, you can make some remarks.\"\n Lucky folded his arms. \"If you don\u0027t mind, Mr. Norrich, I\u0027d like to hear what Bigman has on his mind. And meanwhile, Bigman, suppose you put away the needle-gun.\"\n Bigman did so with a grimace. He said, \"Look, Lucky, I suspected this cobber from the beginning. Those threedee puzzles of his set me to thinking. He was just a little too good. I got to wondering right away that he might be the spy.\"\n \"That\u0027s the second time you\u0027ve called me a spy,\" Norrich cried. \"I won\u0027t stand for that.\"\n \"Look, Lucky,\" said Bigman, ignoring Norrich\u0027s outcry, \"it would be a clever move to have a spy a supposed blind man. He could see an awful lot no one would think he was seeing. People wouldn\u0027t cover up. They wouldn\u0027t hide things. He could be staring right at some vital document and they\u0027d think, \u0027It\u0027s only poor Norrich. He can\u0027t see.\u0027 More likely they wouldn\u0027t give it a thought at all. Sands of Mars, it would be a perfect setup!\"\n Norrich was looking more astonished with every moment. \"But I am blind. If it\u0027s the threedee puzzles or the chess, I\u0027ve explained-\"\n \"Oh, sure, you\u0027ve explained,\" Bigman said scornfully. \"You\u0027ve been practicing explanations for years. How come you sit in the privacy of your room with the lights on, though? When I walked in, Lucky, about half an hour ago, the light was on. He hadn\u0027t just put it on for me. The switch was too far away from where he was sitting. Why?\"\n \"Why not?\" said Norrich. \"It makes no difference to me whether it\u0027s on or not, so it might as well be on as long as I\u0027m awake for the convenience of those who come visiting, like you.\"\n \"All right,\" said Bigman. \"That shows how he can think up an explanation for everything-how he can play chess, how he can identify the pieces, everything. Once he almost forgot himself. He dropped one of his chess pieces and bent to pick it up when he remembered just in time and asked me to do it for him.\"\n \"Usually,\" said Norrich, \"I can tell where something drops by the sound. This piece rolled.\"\n \"Go on, explain,\" said Bigman. \"It won\u0027t help you because there\u0027s one thing you can\u0027t explain. Lucky, I was going to test him. I was going to put out the light, then flash my pocketlight in his eyes at full intensity. If he weren\u0027t blind, he\u0027d be bound to jump or blink his eyes anyway. I was sure I\u0027d get him. But I didn\u0027t even have to go that far. As soon as I put out the light, the poor cobber forgets himself and says, \u0027Why did you put out the light?\u0027... How did he know I put out the light, Lucky? How did he know?\"\n \"But-\" Norrich began.\n Bigman drove on. \"He can feel chess pieces and threedee puzzles and all that but he can\u0027t feel light going out. He had to see that.\"\n Lucky said, \"I think it\u0027s time to let Mr. Norrich say something.\"\n Norrich said, \"Thank you. I may be blind, Councilman, but my dog is not. When I put out the light at night, it makes no difference to me, as I said before, but to Mutt it signals bedtime and he goes to his own corner. Now I heard Bigman tiptoe to the wall in the direction of the light switch. He was trying to move without sound, but a man who has been blind for five years can hear the lightest tiptoe. A moment after he stopped walking I heard Mutt jump into his corner. It didn\u0027t take much brain power to figure out what had happened. Bigman was standing at the light switch and Mutt was turning in for the night. Obviously he had put out the light.\"\n The engineer turned his sightless face in the direction first of Bigman, then of Lucky, as though straining his ears for an answer.\n Lucky said, \"Yes, I see. It seems we owe you an apology.\"\n Bigman\u0027s gnomelike face screwed up unhappily. \"But Lucky-\"\n Lucky shook his head. \"Let go, Bigman! Never hang on to a theory after it\u0027s been exploded. I hope you understand, Mr. Norrich, that Bigman was only doing what he felt to be his duty.\"\n \"I wish he had asked a few questions before acting,\u0027\u0027 said Norrich, coldly, \"Now may I go? Do you mind?\"\n \"You may go. As an official request, however, please make no mention of what has occurred to anyone. That\u0027s quite important.\"\n Norrich said, \"It comes under the heading of false arrest, I imagine, but we\u0027ll let it go. I won\u0027t mention this.\" He walked to the door, reached the signal patch with a minimum of fumbling, and walked out.\n Bigman turned almost at once to Lucky. \"It was a trick. You shouldn\u0027t have let him go.\"\n Lucky, rested his chin on the palm of his right hand, and his calm, brown eyes were thoughtful. \"No, Bigman, he isn\u0027t the man we\u0027re after.\"\n \"But he\u0027s got to be, Lucky. Even if he\u0027s blind, really blind, it\u0027s an argument against him. Sure, Lucky,\" Bigman grew excited again, his small hands clumping into fists, \"he could get close to the V-frog without seeing it. He could kill it.\"\n Lucky shook his head. \"No, Bigman. The V-frog\u0027s mental influence doesn\u0027t depend on its being seen. It\u0027s direct mental contact. That\u0027s the one fact we can\u0027t get around.\" He said slowly, \"It had to be a robot who did that. It had to be, and Norrich is no robot.\"\n \"Well, how do you know he-?\" But Bigman stopped.\n \"I see you\u0027ve answered your own question. We sensed his emotion during our first meeting, when the V-frog was still with us. He has emotions, so he\u0027s not the robot and he\u0027s not the man we\u0027re looking for.\"\n But even as he said so, there was a look of deep trouble on his face and he tossed the book-film on advanced robotics to one side as though despairing of help from it.\n The first Agrav ship ever to be built was named Jovian Moon and it was not like any ship Lucky had ever seen. It was large enough to be a luxury liner of space, but the crew and passenger quarters were abnormally crowded forward,. since nine tenths of the ship\u0027s volume consisted of the Agrav converter and the hyperatomic force-field condensers. From the midsec-tion, curved vanes, ridged into a vague resemblance to bat\u0027s wings, extended on either side. Five to one side, five to the other, ten in all.\n Lucky had been told that these vanes, in cutting the lines of force of the gravitational field, converted the gravity into hyperatomic energy. It was as prosaic as that, and yet they gave the ship an almost sinister appearance.\n The ship rested now in a gigantic pit dug into Jupiter Nine. The lid, of reinforced concrete, had been retracted, and the whole area was under normal Jupiter Nine gravity and exposed to the normal airlessness of Jupiter Nine\u0027s surface.\n Nevertheless the entire personnel of the project, nearly a thousand men, were gathered in this natural amphitheater. Lucky had never seen so many men in space suits at one time. There was a certain natural excitement because of the occasion; a certain almost hysterical restlessness that manifested itself in horseplay made possible by the low gravity.\n Lucky thought grimly: And one of those men in space suits is no man at all.\n But which one? And how could he tell?\n Commander Donahue made his short speech of dedication to a group of men grown silent, impressed despite themselves; while Lucky, looking up at Jupiter, glanced at a small object near it that was not a star but a tiny sliver of light, curved like the paring of a small fingernail, almost too small for the curve to be seen. If there had been any air in the way, instead of Jupiter Nine\u0027s airless vacuum, that small curve would have been blurred into a formless spot of light.\n Lucky knew the tiny crescent to be Ganymede, Jupiter Three, Jupiter\u0027s largest satellite and worthy moon of the giant planet. It was nearly three times the size of Earth\u0027s moon; it was larger than the planet Mercury. It was almost as large as Mars. With the Agrav fleet completed, Ganymede would quickly become a major world of the solar system.\n Commander Donahue christened the ship at last in a voice husky with emotion, and then the assembled audience, in groups of five and six, entered the air-filled interior of the satellite through the various locks.\n Only those who were to be aboard the Jovian Moon remained. One by one they climbed the ramp to the entrance lock, Commander Donahue first.\n Lucky and Bigman were last to board. Commander Donahue turned away from the air lock as they entered, stiffly unfriendly.\n Bigman leaned toward Lucky, to say tightly, \"Did you notice, Lucky, that Red Summers is on board?\"\n \"I know.\"\n \"He\u0027s the cobber who tried to kill you.\"\n \"I know, Bigman.\"\n The ship was lifting now in what was at first a majestic creep. The surface gravity of Jupiter Nine was only one eightieth of Earth, and though the weight of the ship was still in the hundreds of tons, that was not the cause of the initial slowness. Even were gravity absent altogether, the ship would still retain its full content of matter and all the inertia that went with it. It would still be just as hard to put all that matter into motion, or, if it came to that, to stop it or change its direction of travel, once it had begun moving.\n But first slowly, then more and more rapidly, the pit was left behind. Jupiter Nine shrank beneath them and became visible in the visiplatps as a rugged gray rock. The constellations powdered the black sky and Jupiter was a bright marble.\n James Panner approached them and placed an arm on the shoulder of each man. \"Would you two gentlemen care to join me in my cabin for a meal? There\u0027ll be nothing to watch here in the viewing room for a while.\" His wide mouth pulled back in a grin that swelled the cords of his thick neck and made it seem no neck at all but a mere continuation of head.\n \"Thank you,\" Lucky said. \"It\u0027s kind of you to invite us.\"\n \"Well,\" said Panner, \"the commander isn\u0027t going to and the men are a little leery of you, too. I don\u0027t want you to get too lonely. It will be a long trip.\"\n \"Aren\u0027t you leery of me, Dr. Panner?\" Lucky asked dryly.\n \"Of course not. You tested me, remember, and I passed.\"\n Panner\u0027s cabin was a small one in which the three barely fitted. It was obvious that the quarters in this, the first Agrav ship, were as cramped as engineering ingenuity could make them. Panner broke out three cans of ship-ration, the concentrated food that was universally eaten on space ships. It was almost home to Lucky and Bigman; the smell of heating rations, the feeling of crowding walls, outside of which was the infinite emptiness of space, and, sounding through those walls, the steady vibrating hum of hyperatomic motors converting field energies into a directional thrust or, at the very least, powering the energy-consuming innards of the ship.\n If ever the ancient belief of the \"music of the spheres\" could be said to have come literally true, it was in that hum of hyperatomics that was the very essential of space flight.\n Panner said, \"We\u0027re past Jupiter Nine\u0027s escape velocity now, which means we can coast without danger of falling back to its surface.\"\n Lucky said, \"That means we\u0027re in free fall down to Jupiter.\"\n \"With fifteen million miles to fall, yes. Once we\u0027ve piled up enough velocity to make it worthwhile, we\u0027ll shift to Agrav.\"\n , He took a watch out of his pocket as he spoke. It was a large disc of gleaming, featureless metal. He pressed a small catch, and luminous figures appeared upon its face. A glowing line of white encircled it, turning red in a sweeping arc until the redness closed in upon itself and the arc turned white again.\n Lucky said, \"Are we scheduled to enter Agrav so soon?\"\n \"Not very long,\" said Panner. He placed the watch on the table, and they ate silently.\n Panner lifted the watch again. \"A little under a minute. It should be completely automatic.\" Although the chief engineer spoke calmly enough, the hand that held the watch trembled very slightly.\n Panner said, \"Now,\" and there was silence. Complete silence.\n The hum of the hyperatomics had stopped. The very power to keep the ship\u0027s lights on and its pseudo-grav field in operation were now coming from Jupiter\u0027s gravitational field.\n Panner said, \"On the nose! Perfect!\" He put away his watch, and though the smile on his broad, homely face was a restrained one, it virtually shouted relief. \"We\u0027re actually on an Agrav ship now in full Agrav operation.\"\n Lucky was smiling, too. \"Congratulations. I\u0027m pleased to be on board.\"\n \"I imagine you are. You worked hard enough for it. Poor Donahue.\"\n Lucky said gravely, \u0027\u0027I\u0027m sorry I had to push the commander so hard, but I had no choice. One way or another, I had to be on board.\"\n Panner\u0027s eyes narrowed at the sudden gravity in Lucky\u0027s voice. \"Had to be?\"\n \"Had to be! It seems almost certain to me that on board this ship at the present moment is the spy we\u0027re looking for.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lucky-starr-and-the-moons-of-jupiter-lucky-starr-5/page-10.html","bookId":1758,"book":{"id":1758,"title":"Lucky Starr And The Moons of Jupiter (Lucky Starr #5)","description":"Storyline: \n Lucky Starr and the Moons of Jupiter (Lucky Starr #5) \n Sabotage!!! \n Agrav.
