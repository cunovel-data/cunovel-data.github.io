{"id":71948,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"Bigman felt fully confident of Lucky\u0027s ability to handle any overgrown mass of beef, and though he felt a sharp anger at the unsympathetic crowd, he felt no fear.\n Summers had approached the lip of the corridor and so had another, a gangling, dark-complexioned fellow who barked out events as they occurred in a raucous voice, as though it were a flight-polo game on the subetherics.\n There were cheers when Armand first slammed Lucky against the corridor wall. Bigman discounted those with contempt. Of course that shouting fool would try to make it look good for his own side. Wait till Lucky got the feel of the Agrav technique; he would cut that Armand guy into ribbons. Bigman was sure of it.\n But then when the dark fellow yelled, \"Armand has him now in a head lock. He\u0027s maneuvering for a second fall; feet against the wall; retract and extend and there\u0027s the crash, a beauty!\" Bigman felt the beginnings of uneasiness.\n He edged close to the corridor himself. No one paid any attention to him. It was one advantage of his small size. People who didn\u0027t know him tended to discount him as a possible danger, to ignore him.\n Bigman looked down and saw Lucky pushing away from the wall, Armand drifting nearby, waiting.\n \"Lucky!\" he yelled shrilly. \"Stay away!\"\n His cry was lost in the hubbub, but the dark man\u0027s voice as it was lowered in a conversational aside to Red Summers was not. Bigman caught it.\n The dark man said, \"Give the snoop some power, Red. There won\u0027t be any excitement.\"\n And Summers growled in response, \"I don\u0027t want excitement. I want Armand to finish the job.\"\n Bigman didn\u0027t get the significance of the short exchange for a moment, but only for a moment. And then his eyes darted sharply in the direction of Red Summers, whose hands, held closely against his chest, were manipulating some small object Bigman could not identify.\n \"Sands of Mars!\" Bigman cried breathlessly. He sprang back. \"You! Summers! You foul-fighting cobber!\"\n This was another one of those tunes when Bigman was glad he carried a needle-gun even in the face of Lucky\u0027s disapproval. Lucky considered it an unreliable weapon, as it was too hard to focus accurately, but Bigman would sooner doubt the fact that he was as tall as any six-footer as doubt his own skill.\n When Summers didn\u0027t turn at Bigman\u0027s shout, Bigman clenched his fist about the weapon (of which only half-inch of snout, narrowing to a needlepoint, showed between the second and third fingers of his right hand) and squeezed just tightly enough to activate it.\n Simultaneously there was a flash of light six inches in front of Summers\u0027 nose, and a slight pop. It was not very impressive. Only air molecules were being ionized. Summers jumped, however, and panic, transmitted by the V-frog, rose sharply.\n \"Everybody,\" called Bigman. \"Freeze! Freeze! You split-head, underlipped miseries.\" Another needle-gun discharge popped the air, this time over Summers\u0027 head where all could see it plainly.\n Few people might have handled needle-guns, which were expensive and hard to get licenses for, but everybody knew what a needle-gun discharge looked like, if only from subetheric programs, and everyone knew the damage it could do.\n It was as though fifty men had stopped breathing. Bigman was bathed in the cold drizzle of human fear from fifty frightened men. He backed against the wall. He said, \"Now listen, all of you. How many of you know that this cobber Summers is gimmicking my friend\u0027s Agrav controls? This fight is fixed!\"\n Summers said desperately, through clenched teeth, \"You\u0027re wrong. You\u0027re wrong.\"\n \"Am I? You\u0027re a brave man, Summers, when you\u0027ve got fifty against two. Let\u0027s see you stay brave against a needle-gun. They\u0027re hard to aim, of course, and I might miss.\"\n He clenched his fist again, and this time the pop of the discharge was sharply ear-splitting and the flash dazzled all the spectators but Bigman, who, of them all, was the only one who knew exactly when to close his eyes for a moment.\n Summers emitted a strangled yell. He was untouched except that the top button on his shirt was gone\n Bigman said, \"Nice aiming if I do say so myself, but I suppose having a run of luck is too much to ask. I\u0027d advise you not to move, Summers. Pretend you\u0027re stone, you cobber, because if you do move, I\u0027ll miss and feeling a chunk of your skin go will hurt you worse than just losing a button.\"\n Summers closed his eyes. His forehead was glistening with perspiration. Bigman calculated the distance and clenched twice.\n Pow! Smack! Two more buttons gone.\n \"Sands of Mars, my lucky day! Isn\u0027t it nice that you\u0027ve arranged to have no one come around to interfere? Well, one more-for the road.\"\n And this tune Summers yelled in agony. There was a rent in the shirt and reddened skin showed.\n \"Aw,\" said Bigman, \"not on the nose. Now I\u0027m rattled and I\u0027ll probably miss the next by two inches... Unless you\u0027re ready to say something, Summers.\"\n \"All right,\" yelled the other. \u0027\u0027I\u0027ve fixed it.\"\n Bigman said mildly, \"Your man was heavier. Your man had experience and still you couldn\u0027t leave it a fair fight. You don\u0027t take any chances, do you? Drop what you\u0027re holding... Don\u0027t the rest of you move, though. From here on in, it\u0027s a fair fight in the corridor. No one\u0027s moving until someone climbs out of the corridor.\"\n He paused and glared as his fist with the needle-gun moved slowly from side to side. \"But if it\u0027s your ball of gristle that comes back, I\u0027ll just be a bit disappointed. And when I\u0027m disappointed, there\u0027s no telling what I\u0027ll do. I just might be disappointed and mad enough to fire this needle-gun into the crowd, and there isn\u0027t a thing in the world any of you can do to stop me from clenching my fist ten times. So if there are ten of you bored with living, just hope that your boy beats Lucky Starr.\"\n Bigman waited there desperately, his right hand holding the needle-gun, his left arm crooked over the V-frog in its container. He longed to order Summers to bring the two men back, to end the fight, but he dared not risk Lucky\u0027s anger. He knew Lucky well enough to know that the fight couldn\u0027t be allowed to end by default on Lucky\u0027s side.\n A figure whizzed past the line of sight, then another. There was a crash as of a body hitting a wall, then a second and a third. Then silence.\n A figure drifted back, with a second gripped firmly by one ankle.\n The person in control came lightly out into the corridor; the person being held followed and dropped like a sack of sand.\n Bigman let out a shout. The man standing was Lucky. His cheek was bruised and he limped, but it was Armand who was unconscious.\n They brought Armand back to consciousness with some difficulty. He had a lump on his skull resembling a small grapefruit, and one eye was swollen closed. Though his lower lip was bleeding, he managed a painful smile and said, \"By Jupiter, this kid\u0027s a wildcat.\"\n He got to his feet and threw his arms about Lucky in a bear hug. \"It was like tangling with ten men after he got his bearings. He\u0027s all right.\"\n Surprisingly, the men were cheering wildly. The V-frog transmitted relief first, swallowed up at once by excitement\n Armand\u0027s smile widened, and he dabbed at the blood with the back of his hand. \"This councilman is all right. Anyone who still doesn\u0027t like him has to fight me, too. Where\u0027s Red?\"\n But Red Summers was gone. So was the instrument he had dropped at Bigman\u0027s order.\n Annand said, \"Listen, Mr. Starr, I\u0027ve got to tell you. This wasn\u0027t my idea, but Red said we had to get rid of you or you\u0027d make trouble for all of us.\"\n Lucky raised his hand. \"That\u0027s a mistake. Listen, all of you. There\u0027ll be no trouble for any loyal Earthman. I guarantee it. This fight is off the record. It was a bit of excitement, but we can forget it. Next time we meet, we all meet fresh. Nothing\u0027s happened. Right?\"\n They cheered madly and there were shouts of \"He\u0027s all right\" and \"Up the Council!\"\n Lucky was turning to go when Armand said, \"Hey, wait.\" He drew in a vast breath and pointed a thick finger. \"What\u0027s this?\" He was pointing to the V-frog.\n \"A Venusian animal,\" said Lucky. \"A pet of ours.\"\n \"It\u0027s cute.\" The giant simpered down at it. The others crowded close to stare at it and make appreciative comments, to seize Lucky\u0027s hand and assure him that they had been on his side all along.\n Bigman, outraged at the shoving, finally yelled, \"Let\u0027s get to quarters, Lucky, or I swear I\u0027ll kill a few of these guys.\"\n There was an instant silence and men squeezed back to make a path for Lucky and Bigman.\n Lucky winced as Bigman applied cold water to the bruised cheek in the privacy of their quarters\n He said, \"Some of the men were saying something about needle-guns in that final crush, but in the confusion I didn\u0027t get the story straight. Suppose you tell me, Bigman.\"\n Reluctantly Bigman explained the circumstances.\n Lucky said thoughtfully, \"I realized that my controls were off, but I assumed mechanical failure particularly since they came back after my second fall. I didn\u0027t know you and Red Summers were fighting it out over me.\"\n Bigman grinned. \"Space, Lucky, you didn\u0027t think I\u0027d let that character pull a trick like that?\"\n \"There might have been some way other than needle-guns.\"\n \"Nothing else would have frozen them so,\" said Bigman, aggrieved. \"Did you want me to shake my finger at them and say, \u0027Naughty, naughty?\u0027 Besides, I had to scare the green bejeebies out of them.\"\n \"Why?\" Lucky said sharply.\n \"Sands of Mars, Lucky, you spotted the other guy two falls when the fighting was fixed, and I didn\u0027t know if you had enough left to make out. I was going to make Summers call the fight off.\"\n \"That would have been bad, Bigman. We would have gained nothing. There would have been men convinced the cry of \u0027foul\u0027 was an unsportsmanlike fake.\"\n \"I knew you\u0027d figure that, but I was nervous.\"\n \"No need to be. After my controls started responding properly, things went fairly well. Armand was certain he had me, and when he found there was still fight in me, the fight seemed to go out of him. That happens sometimes with people who have never had to lose\n When they don\u0027t win at once, it confuses them, and they don\u0027t win at all.\"\n \"Yes, Lucky,\" said Bigman, grinning.\n Lucky was silent for a minute or two, then he said, \"I don\u0027t like that \u0027Yes, Lucky.\u0027 What did you do?\"\n \"Well-\" Bigman applied the final touch of flesh tint to hide the bruise and stepped back to consider his handiwork critically-\"I couldn\u0027t help but hope that you\u0027d win, now could I?\"\n \"No, I suppose not.\"\n \"And I told everyone in that place that if Armand won, I would shoot as many of them as I could.\"\n \"You weren\u0027t serious.\"\n \"Maybe I was. Anyway, they thought I was; they were sure I was after they saw me needle four buttons off that cobber\u0027s shirt. So there were fifty guys there, even including Summers, who were sweating themselves blind hoping you would win and Armand lose.\"\n Lucky said, \"So that\u0027s it.\"\n \"Well, I couldn\u0027t help it if the V-frog was there and transmitted all those thoughts to you too, could I?\"\n \"So all the fight went out of Armand because his mind was blanketed with wishes he would lose.\" Lucky looked chagrined.\n \"Remember, Lucky. Two foul falls. It wasn\u0027t a fair fight.\"\n \"Yes, I know. Well, maybe I needed the help at that.\"\n The door signal flashed at that moment, and Lucky raised his eyebrows. \"Who\u0027s this, I wonder?\" He pressed the button that retracted the door into its slot.\n A chunky man, with thinning hair and china-blue eyes that stared at them unblinkingly, stood in the doorway. In one hand he held an oddly shaped piece of gleaming metal, which his limber fingers turned end for end. Occasionally the piece ducked between fingers, traveling from thumb to pinkie and back as though it had a life of its own. Bigman found himself watching it, fascinated.\n The man said, \"My name is Harry Norrich. I\u0027m your next-door neighbor.\"\n \"Good day,\" said Lucky.\n \"You\u0027re Lucky Starr and Bigman Jones, aren\u0027t you? Would you care to come to my place a few minutes? Visit a bit, have a drink?\"\n \"That\u0027s kind of you,\" said Lucky. \"We\u0027ll be glad to join you.\"\n Norrich turned somewhat stiffly and led the way down the corridor to the next door. One hand touched the corridor wall occasionally. Lucky and Bigman followed, the latter holding the V-frog.\n \"Won\u0027t you come in, gentlemen?\" He stood aside to let them enter. \"Please sit down. I\u0027ve heard a great deal about you already.\"\n \"Like what?\" asked Bigman.\n \"Like Lucky\u0027s fight with Big Armand and Bigman\u0027s marksmanship with a needle-gun. It\u0027s all over the place. I doubt there\u0027s anyone on Jupiter Nine who won\u0027t hear of it by morning. It\u0027s one of the reasons I asked you in. I wanted to talk to you about it.\"\n He poured a reddish liquor carefully into two small glasses and offered them. For a moment Lucky put his hand some three inches to one side of the glass, waited without result, then reached over and took it from Norrich\u0027s hand. Lucky put the drink to one side\n \"What\u0027s that on your worktable?\" asked Bigman.\n Norrich\u0027s room, in addition to the usual furnishings, had something that looked like a worktable running the length of one wall with a bench before it. On the work-table was a series of metal gimmicks spread out loosely, and in the center was an odd structure, six inches high and very uneven hi outline.\n \"This thing?\" Norrich\u0027s hand slid delicately along the surface of the table and came to rest on the structure. \"It\u0027s a threedee.\"\n \"A what?\"\n \"A three-dimensional jigsaw. The Japanese had them for thousands of years, but they\u0027ve never caught on elsewhere. They\u0027re puzzles, made up of a number of pieces that fit together to form some sort of structure. This one, for instance, will be the model of an Agrav generator when it\u0027s finished. I designed and made this puzzle myself.\"\n He lifted the piece of metal he was holding and placed it carefully in a little slot in the structure. The piece slid in smoothly and held in place.\n \"Now you take another piece.\" His left hand moved gently over the structure, while his right felt among the loose pieces, came up with one, and moved it into place.\n Bigman, fascinated, moved forward, then jumped back at a sudden animal howl from beneath the table.\n A dog came squirming out from beneath the table and put its forefeet on the bench. It was a large German shepherd dog and it stood now looking mildly at Bigman.\n Bigman said nervously, \"Here, now, I stepped on it by accident.\"\n \"It\u0027s only Mutt,\" said Norrich. \"He won\u0027t hurt anyone without better cause than being stepped on. He\u0027s my dog. He\u0027s my eyes.\"\n \"Your eyes?\"\n Lucky said softly, \"Mr. Norrich is blind, Bigman.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lucky-starr-and-the-moons-of-jupiter-lucky-starr-5/page-6.html","bookId":1758,"book":{"id":1758,"title":"Lucky Starr And The Moons of Jupiter (Lucky Starr #5)","description":"Storyline: \n Lucky Starr and the Moons of Jupiter (Lucky Starr #5) \n Sabotage!!! \n Agrav.
