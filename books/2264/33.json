I need to find my kids.” I didn’t want to tell them, he was the Master Key.\\n\\n Servario shook his head with his hand over his face, “Well, that’s all the poverty I can take. Let’s, shall we.” He pointed at the doorway. When Coop didn’t speak Servario turned and left with Luce following him. She smiled back, “He’s sexy. I’m game. It’s better than this shit hole.”\\n\\n I scowled at the dingy insides, “What is this place?”\\n\\n Jack came out with a plate of food, “My old roommate’s mom’s house. She died and he travels a lot, so he hasn’t sold it yet. He isn’t here. He’s in Thailand. He said we could stay, and apparently, he’s rented the basement out to a nice couple of chubby people with their own deep-fry machine. It’s in the house. She made this fish and chips right downstairs.”\\n\\n I laughed and stole a fry, “Those have been around since before you were born, whippersnapper.”\\n\\n He beamed, “I’m getting my mom to buy one.”\\n\\n “You eat whatever you want and stay skinny, don’t you?” I asked.\\n\\n “Yup.” Jack laughed and took the plate of food to the car. He sat up front.\\n\\n I looked at Coop with the gun in his hands still, “Let’s go.”\\n\\n He holstered it and sighed, “This is a mistake. Later when he sells us down the river, you remember I said this was a mistake, and that you were thinking with your dick.”\\n\\n I closed the door behind him, “I will. Don’t worry, I already have my apology planned out. Have you heard anything about the kids and my mom?”\\n\\n He shook his head, “Nope.”\\n\\n I almost sobbed a tiny bit. He walked with me out to the car, “You okay?”\\n\\n I shook my head, “I hardly know. I need my kids.” I didn’t trust Servario’s word that they were fine. Not yet.\\n\\n He looked concerned, as he squished into the back seat. I sat up front with Jack and made him share his food.\\n\\n “Good God, I wish we had brought a larger vehicle. That stinks. Please throw it out the window,” Servario asked, sounding snooty. He clearly had never had to stuff a bunch of people into a car before.\\n\\n I shook my head, “No. Steve’s eating some now too.”\\n\\n Servario opened his window and made a sighing noise.\\n\\n “Is the tartar sauce homemade too?” Steve asked with a big mouthful.\\n\\n Jack nodded, “Yes. I watched her make it, while the fish was frying. Amazing woman.”\\n\\n Coop snorted, “Size of a damned Buick, you mean.”\\n\\n Jack looked back, “You hush your mouth. That woman was a chubby angel. She made me homemade donuts yesterday. I’m marrying a chubby woman. I decided this just yesterday.”\\n\\n I laughed and dragged a fry through the fatty-mayonnaise tartar sauce, “Never trust a skinny cook.”\\n\\n Steve glanced at me, “I thought you were a good cook.”\\n\\n I beamed, “Are you calling me skinny?”\\n\\n He nodded, “You are skinny. Don’t be one of those skinny girls, who doesn’t know she’s skinny.”\\n\\n I gave Coop a death stare, “It doesn’t help when people call you fat, all the time.”\\n\\n Coop looked less than impressed, “I never said you were fat. I said lazy and old.”\\n\\n The same homicidal look I usually had on my face when I was with him, appeared. I turned around, crossing my arms.\\n\\n Servario muttered, “Say something rude like that again, and I won’t need to leak your location.”\\n\\n Coop laughed. I glanced back at him, “Yeah. Look who has the arms dealer on her side? This old, lazy bitch, that’s right.”\\n\\n Coop’s eyes gleamed with the things he wanted to say. He gave me a grin and a wink instead. I shook my head and turned around; it wasn’t the response I was expecting.\\n\\n We drove out of the city to a small, private airport.\\n\\n Steve parked the car and walked ahead. I climbed out and followed him. Servario hurried along, “Hurry. They’re close behind us.”\\n\\n “Who?” Coop asked running for the plane. I cursed my choosing the sexy Christian Louboutin platform, patent-leather jade-colored pumps. They were so pretty. I was never parting with them. I forced Servario to give Roxy money, so she would stop complaining when I tried them on.\\n\\n “You look like a Bratz doll,” Luce said with a smile.\\n\\n I laughed, “His planes have clothes on them. They’re all designer and amazing. It’s a fun distraction.”\\n\\n Her eyes lit up, “What sizes?”\\n\\n I shrugged, “Fours and a couple things in six. Shoes are all size seven. I can squeak into the fours, if I don’t eat or breathe.”\\n\\n She wrinkled her nose, “I’m a six for sure, but I can definitely fit the shoes.”\\n\\n I whispered, “You have to sneak them past Roxy. That girl has a problem.”\\n\\n We were all huffing when we boarded. Everyone put on seat belts as the jet took off.\\n\\n I glanced at Servario, whispering, “How did you know they were coming?”\\n\\n He nodded, “I have a friend. He keeps tabs on CI, CIA, MI6, the UN, and Homeland Security. Thus far, they don’t know we have them.” He looked at Coop, Jack, and Luce sitting up a few rows from us with Steve. “They just think I have you for all the fun I can handle.”\\n\\n I grimaced, “What?”\\n\\n He nodded, “They sold you to me for information. James found documents linking me to the Burrow. It’s what I have been terrified, you would find. I don’t know how James did it. The man was a bumbling idiot. But, even a broken watch is right twice a day.”\\n\\n I gulped, “They knew you were asking for me for sexual purposes?” Horror was smeared across my face. “Why not just kill me? Why do that to me?”\\n\\n “Luring your dad.” He gave me a stern look, “The only stipulation was the fat man and Derringer. CI wanted something on you, something they could lure your father with.”\\n\\n “They told you that?”\\n\\n He shook his head, “No. I know because of sources.”\\n\\n I frowned, still whispering, “CI knows he’s alive?” I’d barely had time to register it myself.\\n\\n “Yes. It was in the documentation James must have found. You must have had something at your house, something that linked me and your father to the Burrow. Information that was from after he had died. I played along and said I had been working your dad over all along, because I had to have the Burrow. I acted like I was willing to do anything to get it. They wanted to make your life so hard, that your dad would be forced out of hiding. They were trying to frame you for a variety of things. Mob ties and other unsavory things. Prostitutes and murderesses lose their children.”\\n\\n I gasped, “You let them humiliate and frame me?”\\n\\n He laughed so quietly, I barely caught it. He shook his head again, “No. I only let them humiliate you. I own the casino and the hotel. I would have faked the recording, before I let them frame you. You ran when I was trying to help you. Fortunately, I didn’t have to. You are a bit of a genius when it comes to spy work.”\\n\\n I looked at Coop and shook my head, “No. It was them. They set it up perfectly.” I looked back at him, “You still let everyone believe you were having sex with me, against my will. How could you do that? And why did they believe you wanted the Burrow so badly?”\\n\\n He gave me a look, “Really? I’m a gunrunner, Evie. I always want anything to do with weaponry. Your pride is nothing, compared to the secrets I keep. I’m sorry you were embarrassed to be with me. Now you know how I manage. But if it makes you feel better, I also told them that I wanted you, because I wanted to avenge the death of my father, more than anything.”\\n\\n My brow knit, “Is that true?”\\n\\n He nodded and whispered, “I told them I wanted to work out a few weeks of fun with the daughter of the man, who had destroyed my family. Your running, only made me look like a monster. I suppose I owe you a thanks for keeping up my appearances.”\\n\\n My insides started to tingle, “My dad killed your dad?”\\n\\n He gave me a look, “It was the bitter end of the Cold War and the Star Wars were out of control; everyone’s dads were murdering someone. Mine caught wind of the Burrow. He wanted it. Your father, being the Master Key, was dispensed to remove the interest in the Burrow. It’s our job.”\\n\\n “I’m sorry.”\\n\\n He shook his head, “Don’t be. Your dad saved my life. I was eighteen and on CI’s payroll, not to mention, given the freedom and finances to do whatever the hell I wanted. I ran the family business the same as I always had, to avoid suspicions. Only I didn’t have to worry, the way my father did. I was given resources. I was able to develop the business and make my family more money, than we could ever spend.”\\n\\n I pointed at his face, “You’ve got a bit of arrogance in your teeth.”\\n\\n He chuckled, “You Americans have a saying for that… don’t hate the player, hate the game.”\\n\\n A sickening amount of disgust was filling me, as I processed the fact he’d told me such nice things, and yet, had bargained to have me.\\n\\n The jet hit cruising altitude and Coop was out of his seat and back with us, within seconds. He knelt in the seat in front of me, looking us both over, “What the fuck?”\\n\\n Servario sighed.\\n\\n I nodded, “He doesn’t like swearing, unless it’s referring to sex.”\\n\\n Coop rolled his eyes, “I care about the terrorist’s feelings.”\\n\\n Servario’s gaze lowered, “I am not a terrorist.”\\n\\n “Arms dealer… terrorist… same shit, different pile of shit.”\\n\\n I laughed, “Wow, this could be fun but let’s not do this. Not on a plane.”\\n\\n Coop tilted his head, “Your call.”\\n\\n Servario scoffed, “I’m comfortable with my cock’s size and how far it can piss, Cooper.” \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-end-of-me-the-single-lady-spy-1/page-33.html","bookId":2264,"book":{"id":2264,"title":"The End of Me (The Single Lady Spy #1)","description":"Storyline: The End of Me (The Single Lady Spy #1) \\n His death was almost the end of me. \\n He was still everywhere, surrounding me. \\n In our children\u0027s eyes, in the smell lingering in our bed, in candy bar wrappers stuffed down the side of the minivan driver door. \\n He was everywhere except where I needed him to be. \\n In my arms, kissing my lips, on the name of the deed to our house. \\n When his death didn\u0027t end me, the proposal from the man who owned every moment of my life, did. \\n My husband carried on in the places he wanted to be but I was gone the moment I agreed. \\n The moment I let him have me, was the end of me. \\n Adult 19+\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-end-of-me-the-single-lady-spy-1.jpg","author":"Tara Brown","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-end-of-me-the-single-lady-spy-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:31 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:21:00 PM"}}
