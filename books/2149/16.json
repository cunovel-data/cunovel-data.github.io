{"id":96456,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"I was on my way to meet Brandon at Willow Park. Brandon planned to take the antidote just before sunset, and he wanted to celebrate with a date by the lake. I tried to convince him he might need time to recover from the serum, but he insisted he wanted to meet me by the shimmering water with a full moon glowing and him being his normal human self. As I sat on the bench and watched the sun set, I imagined how nervous he must be, taking the serum by himself and not knowing if his body would respond well or if it would cause him a permanent lycan condition. I was camped out by the lake when I felt the prickly sensation of being watched. I looked around and saw a figure standing a few yards away from me in the woods. It probably wasn\u0027t the best idea to be waiting alone in the park, but since it was warmer, there were more people milling about. Then I noticed that most were heading home for dinner. \"Brandon?\" I asked. But no one responded. I thought it might be best to get to my car, so I quickly rose when the figure stepped out of the brush. I was surprised when I saw it was Nash approaching me from the woods. \"What are you doing here?\" I asked. \"I wanted to see you.\" Nash was sincere, but now wasn\u0027t the time for a long talk. Brandon would be here soon. \"How did you know I was here?\" I asked. \"Ivy told me. I felt weird all day. I wanted you to know. I\u0027m sorry for the way I\u0027ve been acting.\" \"You don\u0027t have to apologize,\" I said. \"I understand. I would be mad, too.\" But Nash was as candid and gentle as I\u0027d ever seen him. \"I said some awful things. I wanted to tell you that.\" The sun was setting behind him. The sky was beautiful, with different shades of pink and purple. \"It\u0027s okay,\" I said. \"No. Brandon saved me that night - and I was really mean.\" \"But you did say one nice thing,\" I said. \"Yes, I did,\" he said with a glint in his eye. \"I guess I just said it too late.\" We stood awkwardly, not knowing what to say next. As the darkness fell and the full moonlight began to glow, I stared up at my former boyfriend as he gazed down at me. He smiled a sweet smile. Then suddenly his bright expression turned sour. \"Are you okay?\" I asked. Nash\u0027s face looked strained, and then suddenly he fell to his knees. \"Nash!\" I exclaimed. He grabbed his stomach as if he was in severe pain. \"What\u0027s wrong? Are you all right?\" He gripped the grass like he was holding on for his life. He arched his back and then leaned back on his knees. He pulled his shirt off over his head. \"I\u0027m freaking hot!\" he shouted. \"Oh no!\" I said. Nash jumped up and kicked off his sneakers and pulled off his tube socks. \"No, Nash! No!\" I yelled as I watched in horror. Nash was standing in his cargo shorts. He breathed deeply and when he exhaled, out came mist like it was wintertime - only the air outside was at least sixty degrees. \"Nash - \" I said. \"This can\u0027t be happening!\" \"What is wrong with me?\" he said. \"I\u0027m burning up!\" \"It might just be a fever.\" I tried to reassure him and myself. I was afraid of what was happening to him. It couldn\u0027t be. Not two guys in Legend\u0027s Run. This had to be something different. He had to just be having a spring fever. Or so I hoped. Then Nash\u0027s eyes turned a piercing blue gray, and I knew it was worse than spring fever. He stumbled into the woods. \"Nash - \" I called. \"Nash.\" I couldn\u0027t find him. The brush was thick, and with new leaves and buds sprouting, it was hard to see. I heard Nash yell. \"Nash,\" I called back. \"I\u0027ll get help!\" Then I heard a maddening howl. I was so frightened. I covered my ears. \"Not again!\" I yelled to the moon. Nash stepped out from behind a tree. His eyes were a sharp blue gray, and his sandy-blond hair was shoulder length. His chest was chiseled and coated with a layer of blond hair that also covered his arms and legs. His face sported blond sideburns, and his chin was covered with flaxen hair. I was stunned at how handsome and riveting he appeared but scared by his transformation. Then he snarled, and wolf fangs caught the light of the full moon. Frightened, I retreated. \"I have to go get help,\" I said. I inched back, but he wasn\u0027t about to let me out of his sight. I felt like prey, the way he watched me, his eyes glued to me like he was a hunter. Nash breathed heavily. And paced, slowly like a wolf - all the while his blue-gray gaze locked on me. \"It\u0027s okay,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll be right back.\" I wasn\u0027t sure if Nash knew who I was or what had just happened. When Brandon had first transformed, he wasn\u0027t aware of what was going on. But Nash seemed to be stalking me. I continued to step back, not wanting to stay in the woods alone with him in this condition. I wanted to run, but Nash was a star athlete on a good day. Now he\u0027d be twice as fast. My only hope was to trick him. I started forward, then lurched back and ran. Nash had done this a million times, and I learned his fake-out from the football field. There was no way to outrun him, but I had to at least get a head start. I screamed as I raced as fast as I could. The parking lot was far away, but the lake glistened only a few dozen yards from us. I was quaking as I tore down the hill. I could feel his breath on my neck. I knew any minute he\u0027d be on my back. It was only a few feet more to reach the lake when I felt his hand on my shoulder and I went down with a thud. For a moment I was stunned. When I got my bearings, two blue-gray eyes were staring into mine. Nash was leaning over me, blocking me from getting up. He growled, bearing the fangs of a wolf. And I knew I was in danger. He leaned farther into me and drew his fangs up the nape of my neck, sliding them up as if they were a knife. I didn\u0027t feel pain - just the threat of it. Then he took his finger and traced around my face. I felt like he was checking me out. I wasn\u0027t sure if he knew that I was Celeste and that he was in fact a human, too. I wasn\u0027t ready to be his dinner. As he locked his gaze on me again, I pried my foot between us and kicked against him with all my might. He fell back a few inches, which gave me enough space to slither out from his grasp. I raced ahead and realized I was trapped by the lake. With no other alternative, I jumped in and swam for my life. When I got a moment, I looked back. Nash just stood at the edge and paced. I treaded water, waiting as the ripples calmed. Nash peered into the moonlit water and saw his reflection. What he saw staring back startled him. He touched his face and arms. He looked around at the lake and then at me. His hunter\u0027s eyes softened. I think then he realized what had happened, and his face filled with sorrow. Nash paused, as if in despair. Then he let out a maddening howl and tore off into the woods. I waited for a few seconds but he didn\u0027t return. There was no one else in the park but me. I didn\u0027t have much time to escape. Dripping wet, my shoes filled with lake water, I raced back through the park. When I got to my car, I locked the doors and sobbed. I didn\u0027t know who to call - the police, Ivy, my parents, or Brandon. I called Brandon, but he didn\u0027t answer. I hurried back home, locked myself in my room, and was changing into dry clothes and softly crying when I heard a tapping at my window. I was afraid to peer out. I knew Nash might be stalking me. When I heard a tap again, it took all my strength to be brave enough to pull back my curtain. What I saw surprised me. A werewolf was indeed standing outside - but it was Brandon. I ran downstairs, out the back door, and flew into his arms. \"I\u0027m so glad to see you,\" I exclaimed. \"You are? But you weren\u0027t at the park. Are you okay?\" \"You took the serum?\" I asked, his wolf fangs shining at me. \"It didn\u0027t work?\" \"No,\" he said, caressing my hair. \"I just didn\u0027t take it. I wanted one last night like this. I wanted to be cured, but then when I had the chance, I just froze.\" \"You want to be a werewolf?\" I asked. \"I don\u0027t think so. But there was a part of me - I just figured one more night. But when I got to the park - you weren\u0027t there. The place was empty, but the scent of other wolves was there. I\u0027m glad you didn\u0027t come.\" \"I did go. I was there - but so was Nash,\" I said. \"What was he doing there?\" \"He wanted to apologize to me.\" \"Is that all?\" he asked. \"Yes, but then the full moon came out and he changed! Nash changed!\" Brandon stepped back. \"What?\" \"He became a werewolf!\" Brandon\u0027s expression was severe. \"Did he hurt you?\" \"I think he wanted to. I was so scared - I\u0027m not sure he knew what was going on. I felt so bad for him, but I was truly frightened - for him and for me.\" \"So did he attack you?\" \"No, it was more like he was stalking me - like the wolf was doing to that deer the night Nash was bitten. He saw what he looked like in the lake\u0027s reflection. Then he took off.\" \"I should have been there for you,\" he said. \"There was no way to know for sure that this would happen - that he\u0027d be there.\" I was shaken up. I sat with Brandon beside a tree. He kissed and caressed me. I could feel his heart racing as he tried to calm me down. \"What do we do?\" I asked. \"There is nothing we can do tonight,\" he insisted. \"We can try to take our minds off of it for a while.\" He stroked my cheek with the back of his hand. It was extra soothing with the soft, thin layer of dark hair that wasn\u0027t there during the day. \"Would you like to?\" \"Yes,\" I agreed. \"We can have our date out here,\" he said. \"Back behind the houses.\" \"I\u0027d like that,\" I said. \"With you, I\u0027ll feel safe.\" We walked in the woods, holding hands. Brandon gently guided me over fallen branches and through rough terrain. When we were deep in the woods, Brandon perked up like he\u0027d sensed something. \"What?\" I asked as he stopped in his tracks. All of a sudden we were joined by a pack of wolves. I hid behind him. I was nervous, even though I knew I must be safe with Brandon here. It was hard for me to let down my guard - it was my instinct to fear them. But the wolves just looked to Brandon as if he was the alpha male. Brandon tried to reassure me it was safe. He patted the leader of the pack and I watched, as I always did, in awe. A few minutes later, he took my hand again and we continued walking as the wolves followed close behind like a pet dog might around the yard. It was as magical an experience as I could have imagined. I had longed to do nature activities with my friends, who preferred walking in the mall to the woods or a park. Not only did I get to experience wonderful outdoorsy activities with Brandon, but when he was in werewolf form they were truly extraordinary. We eventually stopped by a massive tree, and Brandon drew me into him and kissed me with extra intensity. I leaned my head on his chest as the wolves lay at his feet. But as I felt his werewolf heart race, I knew that there was another one racing in some other woods as well. I gazed up at Brandon and he, too, was staring off, with a burden in his gray eyes that hadn\u0027t been there before. Another werewolf was running around Legend\u0027s Run now. And though Brandon and I tried to make this date perfect, neither one of us could lose the concern we had for Nash and the ramifications that were caused by the bite under a full moon.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/magic-of-the-moonlight-full-moon-2/page-16.html","bookId":2149,"book":{"id":2149,"title":"Magic of the Moonlight (Full Moon #2)","description":"Storyline: Magic of the Moonlight (Full Moon #2) Beware of a bite under a full moon… it will complicate your love life.
