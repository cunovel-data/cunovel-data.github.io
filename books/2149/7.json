{"id":96447,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"It was in the late afternoon one day before the rise of the full moon when I found myself sitting with Brandon and his grandparents on their living room couch, awaiting Dr. Maddox\u0027s arrival. I was excited to meet Brandon\u0027s father. His visit would not only offer Brandon reassurance by his father\u0027s presence, but Dr. Maddox might even have an idea for a possible cure. Brandon, his legs twitching restlessly, kept switching channels on the TV. \"It\u0027s okay,\" I said. \"He\u0027ll be here soon.\" But that didn\u0027t seem to assuage his agitation. Even his husky began to bark as if he, too, was feeling Brandon\u0027s tension. \"Calm down, Apollo,\" he commanded. Instantly the dog winced, then lay by Brandon\u0027s feet. \"Why are you so antsy?\" I asked. \"I bet you are excited to see your dad.\" Brandon didn\u0027t respond but perked up. At the same time, Apollo\u0027s ears stood up, and he raced to the window and began barking. Within a few seconds there was a knock on the door. I half expected Dr. Maddox to enter in a lab coat, wearing thick black glasses, and mad scientist - style gray, wiry, untamed hair. But instead he was handsome like Brandon, with dark hair, and dressed in a brown sport coat, jeans, and trendy metal rectangular-shaped glasses. \"Connor, it\u0027s so wonderful to see you!\" Brandon\u0027s grandmother gushed. Dr. Maddox was greeted by hugs and kisses from his delighted parents. It was obvious he was thrilled to see Brandon as he gave him a warm embrace. \"Dad, this is Celeste,\" Brandon said proudly as if he was showing me off. I didn\u0027t know if Brandon had even mentioned me to his dad - or what he might have said about our relationship. I felt awkward not knowing but reassured that Brandon seemed so happy. \"Hello there, Celeste,\" Dr. Maddox said, extending his hand. \"I am very pleased to meet you.\" \"I\u0027m pleased to meet you, too, Dr. Maddox.\" I shook the senior Maddox\u0027s hand. It was firm and warm, just like Brandon\u0027s. \"Please, call me Connor,\" he said, and gestured for us all to sit down. I sat quietly and watched the Maddox family reunite as Dr. Maddox shared a few tales from overseas. It was interesting to see the dynamics of Brandon\u0027s family. They all seemed very intelligent and motivated. And Brandon beamed, having his father and grandparents surrounding him. It was the first time I\u0027d seen him truly relaxed. \"Well, it\u0027s time for us to turn in,\" his grandparents said when the evening wore on. We all said our goodnights to them. I felt the mood shift a bit and realized that now was the time that Brandon needed to tell his father why he\u0027d asked him to come home from Europe. Dr. Maddox checked to see that his parents were out of earshot, then he sat across from us in a comfy chair while Brandon and I sat close on the sofa. \"So, what did you want to tell me?\" Dr. Maddox said. \"You two aren\u0027t getting married, are you?\" he joked. \"No.\" Brandon laughed. \"Then what is it that you wouldn\u0027t tell me on the phone?\" \"I was bitten by a wolf.\" Dr. Maddox was taken aback. \"Are you okay?\" Brandon pulled off his fingerless glove and showed his scarred palm to his father. He examined it closely. \"When did this happen?\" \"A few months ago.\" \"Where?\" \"In a wooded area.\" \"What were you doing in the woods?\" his father asked. \"He saved me,\" I blurted out. \"It was my fault. I was in the woods - lost - and stumbled on a pack of wolves. I\u0027m sure I wouldn\u0027t be here if it weren\u0027t for Brandon. He is a hero.\" Brandon blushed, and Dr. Maddox beamed with pride. \"Why didn\u0027t you tell me this when it happened?\" his father asked. Brandon withdrew his hand and replaced the glove. \"I didn\u0027t want to bother you.\" \"You aren\u0027t a bother. You should have called me. I want to know what is going on with you. Just because I\u0027m in Europe doesn\u0027t mean I\u0027m not your father,\" Dr. Maddox said sincerely. \"Did you go to a doctor?\" \"Not at first. But Grandma saw my hand and made me go. I got a shot and some stitches and that was the end of that.\" \"Or so we thought,\" I said. Dr. Maddox raised an eyebrow over his glasses. \"So you said you had a reaction to something. Is this what it was?\" \"Yes,\" Brandon said. \"What kind of reaction did you have? A fever?\" \"Yes. But it didn\u0027t happen until a month later.\" \"Then how do you know it was from the bite?\" his father wondered. \"You\u0027ll think I\u0027m crazy.\" I looked to Brandon. \"Tell me,\" his father persuaded. \"I\u0027m sure I\u0027ve heard something like it before. It\u0027s hard to surprise a scientist.\" \"Something happened.\" Brandon wrung his fingers together nervously. \"What, Brandon? I\u0027m here to listen.\" \"I changed.\" Brandon fidgeted in his seat. \"Changed how?\" \"It was a full moon when I was bitten. Then the following full moon, I got the fever.\" Brandon paused. I placed my hand on his knee, trying to give the comfort I think he was searching for. \"I had these dreams all month long,\" he continued. \"Weird ones.\" Brandon turned back to me. \"You have to tell him everything,\" I coaxed him. \"You\u0027ll think I\u0027m crazy, Dad.\" \"I won\u0027t,\" he said reassuringly, with a bit of impatience and weariness from his long day of traveling. \"Go on.\" \"This is hard to talk about.\" \"They were just dreams, right?\" his father asked. \"Everyone has weird dreams. It\u0027s okay.\" \"I was a wolf. Running through the woods and fields. Even around houses.\" That part shocked me. I hadn\u0027t heard that Brandon had dreamed about being near homes, too. \"Anything else?\" his father asked. \"I couldn\u0027t sleep. I mean, I dreamed, but I didn\u0027t feel like I was really sleeping. I woke up exhausted and starved.\" It was apparent his father was concerned for his son as he leaned in to hear more. \"I wish you would have talked to me,\" Dr. Maddox said. \"What was there to tell?\" Brandon said. \"\u0027I\u0027ve been having nightmares, so come home from Europe?\u0027 I\u0027m not a kid.\" \"I know - but . . . so what is this concern with the full moon? You\u0027ve never been into that sort of cosmic stuff before.\" \"One night Celeste came over, and we were hanging out in the guesthouse,\" Brandon continued. \"The sun set and I felt strange. . . . I really don\u0027t want to tell you more.\" Brandon stopped and covered his face with his hands. It was like he was afraid of revealing actions that might make the doctor think he should be institutionalized. \"You\u0027ll think I\u0027m making this up,\" he started again. \"It\u0027s nuts. This stuff doesn\u0027t really happen - just in movies.\" \"Well, Celeste seems like a very smart girl, and she\u0027s sitting with you and seems to believe in you,\" his father said. \"And you\u0027ve never lied to me before - why would I think you\u0027re lying to me now?\" \"Because I turned into a werewolf!\" Brandon exclaimed, his hands tightening into fists. His father\u0027s eyes widened and his mouth dropped open. Then he laughed. \"You\u0027ve got to be kidding me!\" \"I\u0027m not.\" Brandon was dead serious. \"You are paying me back for disrupting your life. I understand that.\" \"I\u0027m not, Dad.\" \"All you had to do was say you wanted me to come back for a visit. I would have. You didn\u0027t have to concoct this crazy story.\" \"I knew you\u0027d think I was crazy.\" \"That is the strangest thing you\u0027ve ever said. Even as a kid. I thought it was something serious. Now I can breathe easier.\" His father stretched his arms out and sighed. Then he placed his hands on his lap as if he was signaling the end of the conversation. \"We can talk more tomorrow. I\u0027m sure I\u0027ll have some dreams, too, tonight. Maybe I\u0027ll be a zombie.\" When Dr. Maddox stood up, I saw all the hope rush out of Brandon. I knew I had to say something before his father went up to bed. I rose with all the force I had. \"It wasn\u0027t just a dream, Dr. Maddox,\" I said, my voice quaking and my eyes almost teary. \"It really happened. I saw it. I was there.\" He stopped and studied me as if he didn\u0027t know how to address my sudden outburst. \"You have to believe me,\" I pleaded. \"Us. I mean, Brandon.\" Dr. Maddox was in disbelief. I wasn\u0027t sure what he was going to do - and it seemed, as he stared at us, that he didn\u0027t know what to do himself. \"See - I was afraid you wouldn\u0027t believe me,\" Brandon said sadly. \"If I can\u0027t trust you - who can I trust?\" He got up and started for the back door. \"Brandon, get back here,\" his father called. But instead Brandon headed outside. The screen door slammed behind him. Tears welled in my eyes. I felt awful for Brandon. And bad for his father. \"Celeste - \" his father said, stopping me. \"What is he really going through? Is he having a hard time adjusting here?\" \"Brandon needs your help,\" I urged him. \"Tomorrow is a full moon.\" \"I\u0027m not sure - \" \"Please, Dr. Maddox. If he knows you don\u0027t believe him, you\u0027ll break his spirit.\" \"That is why he insisted that I come here now?\" \"Yes. Tomorrow is a full moon,\" I repeated. \"You will see the change for yourself.\" Dr. Maddox wasn\u0027t convinced. \"Well, whatever this is, I\u0027m not leaving. We\u0027ll get this solved. Okay?\" We found Brandon outside, throwing rocks between the trees. \"I shouldn\u0027t have asked you to come,\" he told his father. It was as if those words hit his father like an arrow. I could see the pain in his eyes - the pain of not being there for his son, even now that he was in fact physically here. \"No. You were right to.\" He patted Brandon on the shoulder. \"It\u0027s been a long day for both of us. We\u0027ll get some rest. Tomorrow I\u0027ll take some samples, take a look, and run some tests. And by sunset we\u0027ll see what happens.\" Dr. Maddox was more confident than concerned. Brandon\u0027s sullen mood brightened. \"You will?\" \"You are my son,\" he said. \"I won\u0027t let anything happen to you now that I\u0027m here.\" Brandon\u0027s father gave him a reassuring hug. \"It was great meeting you, Celeste. I\u0027m grateful Brandon has found such a good friend.\" Dr. Maddox headed back inside, and Brandon took my hand and walked me to my car. \"I feel so stupid,\" he said. \"Don\u0027t. He has to know.\" \"Maybe I should have gone to Dr. Meadows instead. She\u0027s into the paranormal. My dad is a scientist. Something like this is only fantasy to him.\" \"He\u0027ll see tomorrow night how fantasy is reality.\" Brandon looked up at the almost-full moon. Tomorrow evening would be the first of his three nightly transformations. He hugged me hard. I could feel the weight of his condition wearing on him. But I was curious about one part of his dreams that I hadn\u0027t heard before. \"When you\u0027ve been dreaming about running around houses,\" I asked, \"where were you going?\" \"To yours,\" he said. \"Always to yours.\" Brandon kissed me goodnight and watched me as I pulled away. I wasn\u0027t going to get much sleep tonight, and neither was Brandon. And Dr. Maddox was in for a restless night as well.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/magic-of-the-moonlight-full-moon-2/page-7.html","bookId":2149,"book":{"id":2149,"title":"Magic of the Moonlight (Full Moon #2)","description":"Storyline: Magic of the Moonlight (Full Moon #2) Beware of a bite under a full moon… it will complicate your love life.
