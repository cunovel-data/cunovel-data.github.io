{"id":96450,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"I didn\u0027t want to be apart from Brandon, but I had to keep my needs separate from his - my desire to confess to my friends that I was in love with him and my longing to be with him as a werewolf had to take a backseat to his need to be cured.\\n\\n Ivy, Abby, and the gang were coming over, and I hoped it would keep my mind occupied and not focused on whatever Brandon\u0027s father needed to do to keep him safe and find an antidote. My parents agreed to go out to another movie so I could have my friends over.\\n\\n I felt so awkward waiting for the gang to arrive. We didn\u0027t have a media room with a fifty-inch big-screen TV, leather theater chairs, or a popcorn machine. Instead, we\u0027d be watching TV in our small family room. It was going to be cozy, to say the least.\\n\\n Ivy and Abby arrived together with a stack of movies, and Jake, Dylan, and Nash showed up with drinks and chips.\\n\\n \"We weren\u0027t sure what to watch, so we brought a few choices,\" Abby said.\\n\\n \"Since it is a full moon,\" Ivy said cheekily, \"I thought we\u0027d watch An American Werewolf in London.\"\\n\\n Jake howled, and Dylan joined him.\\n\\n I loved the movie and had watched it several times on Halloweens past - but tonight it wasn\u0027t going to distract me from the day\u0027s events, just remind me of Brandon.\\n\\n \"You know what they say about a full moon! People act crazy,\" Ivy said.\\n\\n \"When should I start?\" Jake said, making some growling noises. He nuzzled up to Ivy, sending her into giggles.\\n\\n Dylan tugged Abby\u0027s belt and pulled her to him for a quick kiss. \"Is that crazy enough for you?\" he asked.\\n\\n Nash looked to me for signs of what kind of affection to show. He wasn\u0027t about to make a move in front of everyone - as he wasn\u0027t sure how I\u0027d respond.\\n\\n We all flopped onto the couches, and Nash ended up next to me. I couldn\u0027t help but inhale his sexy body-wash scent. He scooted so close to me I thought he was going to wind up in my lap. For a moment I was lost in the world that had once been. The sixsome, together.\\n\\n Champ suddenly began barking incessantly by the back door.\\n\\n \"What the . . . ?\" Jake said, pointing to the family room window.\\n\\n \"What? A ghost?\" Abby said.\\n\\n \"You have to see this,\" Jake said.\\n\\n We all gathered around the window to find two beady eyes staring up at us.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a dog,\" Abby said. \"Calm down.\"\\n\\n Just then the animal howled a deep howl.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a wolf!\" Dylan said.\\n\\n Ivy and Abby screamed.\\n\\n \"Lock the door!\" Nash said, stepping away from the window.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s already locked,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Make sure,\" he demanded.\\n\\n \"Turn the lights on,\" Ivy said. \"Maybe that will scare it away.\"\\n\\n \"We are safe, guys,\" I said. Even though I put on a brave face, I was nervous. What was a wolf doing howling outside my window? Was this a lone, misguided wolf? Or was this one trying to signal to me that Brandon was in trouble?\"\\n\\n Ivy continued to scream, and Abby threw sofa pillows against the window.\\n\\n \"Shoo!\" she said.\\n\\n \"Stop that,\" I said. \"You\u0027ll break something.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s staring straight at you, Celeste,\" Ivy exclaimed.\\n\\n \"Maybe it\u0027s Brandon,\" Jake teased.\\n\\n Jake and Dylan pressed their heads against the window. Jake made faces at the wild canine while Dylan tapped the glass.\\n\\n I, too, pressed my face to the glass to see if I could see more wolves or Brandon.\\n\\n Just then another howl was heard from somewhere in the backyard. The wolf\u0027s ears perked up, and he barked at me a few times. Then he turned around and disappeared.\\n\\n \"That was creepy!\" Ivy said. \"I don\u0027t want to watch that movie now.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s gone,\" I said. \"It\u0027s okay.\"\\n\\n \"But what if it comes back?\" Ivy said.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think it will,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Dylan confirmed. \"It went off into the woods. Whatever it wanted, it doesn\u0027t want it anymore.\"\\n\\n But the fun mood was broken. \"I only brought scary movies,\" Ivy said, soured by the unwanted visitor.\\n\\n \"We can\u0027t go home now,\" Abby said.\\n\\n We sat for a while longer, but I was distracted by the wolf, and so, it seemed, were the others. The gathering was spoiled; we couldn\u0027t lose ourselves in watching a scary movie.\\n\\n \"Maybe we should reschedule this,\" I said.\\n\\n \"We are being rude - \" Ivy said.\\n\\n \"No you\u0027re not,\" I told her. \"We\u0027ll do it again at your house - in your awesome media room.\"\\n\\n Eventually my friends agreed to end the evening early.\\n\\n \"We can\u0027t leave Celeste home with a wolf running around,\" Abby said.\\n\\n \"My parents will be home soon,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll be okay. Besides, I\u0027m safe in a house.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, I guess so,\" Abby said.\\n\\n \"There is something about you,\" Ivy said. \"You attract wolves.\"\\n\\n The guys got their belongings while the girls hugged me good-bye. Nash leaned in to kiss me but I stepped back awkwardly and reached for the front door instead. I did care for Nash and still thought he was attractive. I didn\u0027t wish anything but good things for him. But I didn\u0027t want to encourage him to think I felt more deeply for him than I did or was planning on a reunion. Though I still felt compassion for my first crush and former boyfriend, I didn\u0027t have the kind of feelings for him that I had for Brandon - that unbridled passion and heavenly feeling that was true love.\\n\\n They all were on the lookout as they exited my house and ran safely to their cars.\\n\\n As my friends drove off, Champ began to bark again by the back door.\\n\\n I heard a tap at my window. I was afraid to see the wolf back again, this time all alone in my house. I gingerly pulled a curtain back and looked out into the backyard. At first I saw nothing, but then I could make out a figure standing at the trunk of a tree a few yards away.\\n\\n Gray eyes gazed back, but they were at the height of someone standing on two legs.\\n\\n I raced outside and plowed into Brandon\u0027s embrace.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m so happy to see you,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Me too,\" he said. Then he hesitated. \"Nash was here.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s just my friend.\"\\n\\n \"But he wants to get back with you. I see it all the time.\"\\n\\n \"We are just friends. That\u0027s all.\"\\n\\n \"But I want to be your friend. I want to hang out with you and your best friends. What good am I now, standing outside in the woods, hungry like a wolf?\"\\n\\n I held his hand and caressed it. \"I want us to be together, too,\" I said. \"Did your father see you tonight?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. He couldn\u0027t get what he needed. I wouldn\u0027t let him. I can\u0027t help myself when I\u0027m like this. I guess it\u0027s just animal instinct, but at the moment that he comes at me with a needle, he\u0027s not my father and I\u0027m not his son. He\u0027s someone I don\u0027t trust and feel is going to hurt me.\"\\n\\n \"Oh . . .\" I said, disappointed for him.\\n\\n \"But . . . I think I might be better if you are there - \"\\n\\n \"Why?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"There is something I see when I look into your eyes - sweetness and goodness - in whatever form I\u0027m in. I get this overwhelming sense that you are . . .\"\\n\\n I waited to hear what he might say.\\n\\n \". . . there to help me. Not threatening, I guess. Maybe I sense love.\"\\n\\n I beamed with pride.\\n\\n \"From my father I sense fear and confusion. And it only makes me angry.\"\\n\\n \"But how can I be there when your dad doesn\u0027t want me around your house - around you - on a full moon?\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s like me; he wants to protect you.\"\\n\\n \"I know, but I don\u0027t need protecting. I only need you.\"\\n\\n \"Will you come back with me?\"\\n\\n \"Now?\"\\n\\n He nodded.\\n\\n \"Of course.\" I liked being needed by Brandon. I felt like I could somehow repay him for my fault in all of this. He had saved me and because of that suffered this lycan affliction. I\u0027d do anything for him.\\n\\n \"But I have to ask you one thing: Are you afraid of me?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" I reassured him. \"Maybe I should be, but I\u0027m not.\"\\n\\n He breathed a sigh of relief. \"I can\u0027t lose you. You are the only one who makes me feel sane.\" He leaned in and hugged me. \"Remember what I said that night we kissed, under the full moon?\"\\n\\n I smiled widely.\\n\\n \"I love you, Celeste,\" he said again.\\n\\n \"I love you, too,\" I said. It was as natural as if I\u0027d been saying it to him for years.\\n\\n I stared up at him. I was dying for a kiss, the kind that took my breath away, made me dizzy, and felt like I was in heaven. He was magnetic, spellbinding, hypnotic. I was drawn to him like I\u0027d never been drawn to any other guy. He stared back at me with his wolfish gray eyes. He leaned down and kissed me so intensely I thought the ground would shake under my feet. I fell into his arms.\\n\\n I held him tightly under the tree in my backyard. I wasn\u0027t about to leave him again.\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t abandon him. Not now. Not ever.\\n\\n When the night wore on and our kisses continued, Brandon told me it was time to go.\\n\\n I agreed to meet him at the hilltop behind his house, and he withdrew into the woods. I was anxious when I drove to the Westside, wondering if Dr. Maddox\u0027s plan would work. I parked by Brandon\u0027s guesthouse and raced up the hilltop before his father could spot me.\\n\\n Apollo, Brandon\u0027s grandparents\u0027 husky, was barking in the main house, and I knew that the sound of my car driving in wouldn\u0027t go unnoticed.\\n\\n I was trying to find Brandon on the hilltop when I heard my name being called in the woods behind me.\\n\\n \"Celeste,\" Dr. Maddox hollered. \"Celeste.\"\\n\\n The sound got closer, and Dr. Maddox reached me before I could find Brandon.\\n\\n \"Brandon wants you to help him,\" I said. \"He wants you to do the tests, but I have to be with him. It\u0027s the only way he\u0027ll be able to do it.\"\\n\\n \"But that\u0027s impossible. I will have to tranquilize him first in order to take the blood samples. You see what he\u0027s like. He didn\u0027t come home last night - or today. I don\u0027t even know where he is. He could be anywhere - doing anything.\"\\n\\n Just then Brandon emerged from the shadows.\\n\\n Brandon appeared as magnificent as he had just a short time ago. His hair was fiercely wild, and his face was laced with a handsome goatee matching his dark locks. He wore a skeptical expression and a pair of jeans. His sharp fangs glowed in the moonlight.\\n\\n \"Brandon!\" his father gasped.\\n\\n Dr. Maddox moved in front of me, blocking me from view.\\n\\n Brandon growled.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s okay - \" I said. \"He\u0027s not going to hurt me - or you. Brandon needs your help, Dr. Maddox, but the only way for you to get close to him with your needle is if I am here, too.\" I turned to Brandon. \"It\u0027s okay, Brandon. You said if I was here, it will be okay.\"\\n\\n But Brandon wasn\u0027t appeased. He shifted uneasily, backing away toward the trees.\\n\\n Then I heard Dr. Meadows\u0027s words in my head - Beware of a bite under a full moon. Maybe this did mean me - or Brandon\u0027s father. And maybe it meant now.\\n\\n Brandon must have noticed the fear in my face. His eyes softened as if he felt sad for me.\\n\\n He reached out his hand. I took it and stepped toward him. I hugged him and caressed his long locks as his father quickly scrambled around the tree on the opposite side of Brandon.\\n\\n While I continued to hold Brandon, his father crept up behind him and pushed the syringe into Brandon\u0027s arm in an attempt to tranquilize him.\\n\\n Brandon jerked angrily, and I fell from his embrace. He yelled out a fiery howl.\\n\\n I was startled. Apparently we all were.\\n\\n The needle was still stuck in his arm, but the tranquilizer hadn\u0027t been injected. Brandon turned to his father with an angry stare, and Dr. Maddox, ghost white, stared back at his son. Dr. Maddox didn\u0027t say a word, the tension in the woods as thick as the brush itself.\\n\\n As Brandon continued to glare at his father, I quietly rose to my feet behind him. I quickly pushed the plunger in, then grabbed the empty syringe and withdrew it from his arm in an instant.\\n\\n He whipped around to me with a maddened look. I was afraid, and the needle shook in my hand. But when we locked eyes, his mood once again softened and his tense body relaxed.\\n\\n Dr. Maddox took the syringe from my shaking hand and packed it away in his bag, and we watched as Brandon stormed off. We heard him shuffling through the brush, but he soon stopped.\\n\\n We cautiously crept after Brandon and found him still standing, panting heavily by a tree.\\n\\n \"Stay back,\" his father said to me.\\n\\n Just then Brandon\u0027s legs wavered. He stumbled as he tried to stay upright. His eyelids started to droop, and he fought to stay standing and awake.\\n\\n He grabbed the tree for support but began to lose the battle. The tranquilizer had taken over, and he was clawing at the tree as he continued to stumble. He reached out to me again, but by the time I got to him, he was already lying on the ground.\\n\\n \"No - \" his father said. \"It might be a trick.\"\\n\\n \"He wouldn\u0027t do that!\" I said.\\n\\n I took his hand, which was limp in mine. His eyes were closed, and he lay fast asleep. Brandon was beautiful, lying there in the woods like a sleeping prince. I continued to hold his hand, and I brushed his hair away from his face and caressed his cheek. He was warm and sweaty from his battle with us and the medication.\\n\\n \"I need to take a blood sample now,\" his father said. \"I\u0027m not sure how long the tranquilizer will last.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to stay here with him,\" I replied.\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t let you do that,\" he said. \"It\u0027s not safe.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s safe now,\" I said, still stroking Brandon\u0027s cheek.\\n\\n His father gave up fighting me and withdrew a needle from his bag. He wiped Brandon\u0027s forearm with an alcohol swab. \"Wow - it\u0027s really easy to find a vein now,\" he said.\\n\\n He quickly stuck the needle into Brandon, who didn\u0027t even flinch. Dr. Maddox placed the samples in a plastic bag and sealed them away in his medical bag.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll walk you to your car,\" he said.\\n\\n \"I told you, I want to stay here with him,\" I countered. Brandon was so handsome lying next to me. I wanted to stay with him all night until he awoke.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to watch him to make sure he\u0027s all right,\" he said. \"From a distance. I don\u0027t know when he\u0027ll wake up and what mood he\u0027ll be in, but I can only imagine. There\u0027s nothing for you to do here.\"\\n\\n I knew I wouldn\u0027t be able to convince Dr. Maddox to let me stay, and I did feel secure knowing someone, especially a scientist, would be observing him.\\n\\n Dr. Maddox patted my shoulder and guided me away from the sleeping werewolf. I felt bad for Brandon that his heroism had come to this.\\n\\n \"He may be angry tomorrow,\" Dr. Maddox said when we reached my car.\\n\\n \"I think I will be, too,\" I mumbled. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/magic-of-the-moonlight-full-moon-2/page-10.html","bookId":2149,"book":{"id":2149,"title":"Magic of the Moonlight (Full Moon #2)","description":"Storyline: Magic of the Moonlight (Full Moon #2) \\n Beware of a bite under a full moon… \\n it will complicate your love life. \\n Celeste has more to worry about than a secret romance with a hot guy from the wrong side of town.
