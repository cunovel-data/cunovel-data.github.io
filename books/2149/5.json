{"id":96445,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"My mind and heart were racing. Dr. Meadows\u0027s prediction haunted me like the other ones she had forecasted. Why did we have to go to Penny for Your Thoughts in the first place? Not only did I have to deal with Nash\u0027s behavior and Brandon\u0027s impending transformation but now another vague glimpse into my future? I wasn\u0027t sure what the prediction even meant. All I knew was someone was going to be bitten - by a wolf or werewolf - and somehow my love life would be complicated. Wasn\u0027t it complicated enough already?\\n\\n Once I\u0027d left the basketball game, I didn\u0027t know what to do. If I kept this a secret, I thought my mind would explode. Wasn\u0027t I holding too many secrets already? And if I was going to tell someone, there was only one person to tell. The only person I thought might understand was Brandon - but by telling him, I\u0027d risk him withdrawing from me because I\u0027d be causing him more stress than he already had. As I drove home, I contemplated this new dilemma and realized I had to tell Brandon. Not only was he a great friend, but he always seemed sensible and he might be able to figure out what Dr. Meadows meant. Besides, it might be important that he know what the psychic was saying about him. I dialed him on my cell, but he didn\u0027t pick up. When I pulled into my driveway, I texted him and waited. But still no response. Was he out in his backyard chopping wood? Or was he out grocery shopping for his grandparents and couldn\u0027t grab his ringing phone?\\n\\n When I reached my bedroom, I heard \"Fly Me to the Moon\" playing. Finally!\\n\\n \"I need to see you,\" I blurted out.\\n\\n \"Are you okay?\" he asked, his voice filled with concern.\\n\\n \"Yes. I just need to talk. Can I come to your house?\"\\n\\n \"Uh . . . sure. I was just working out back, so I\u0027ll need to clean up.\"\\n\\n \"Well, that might have to wait. I saw Dr. Meadows again.\"\\n\\n \"Oh no,\" he said. Then he didn\u0027t speak.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m on my way,\" I said, and hung up the phone.\\n\\n I found Brandon outside his guesthouse, waiting for me and holding a bouquet of pink and yellow tulips. Not only wasn\u0027t he dirty from working, but his hair was slightly damp from showering, and he was wearing a different outfit from the one he\u0027d worn to school.\\n\\n When he saw me, he flashed a wide smile and handed me the lovely flowers.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s so sweet of you!\" I said. \"I love tulips!\"\\n\\n \"I saw them at the market, and I thought they belonged with you,\" he said, watching me breathe them in. The fragrant aroma was as invigorating as he was. \"I was planning on leaving them by your locker tomorrow, but when you called, I figured I\u0027d give them to you in person.\"\\n\\n \"That was so thoughtful!\" I leaned my head on his chest, but when I didn\u0027t come up for a kiss, he sensed something was wrong.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s up?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want to tell you.\" I gazed down at my sneakers.\\n\\n \"Is everything all right?\"\\n\\n \"For now.\"\\n\\n \"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n \"I got another warning from Dr. Meadows,\" I said, now looking up at him.\\n\\n \"I thought you weren\u0027t going to see her.\"\\n\\n \"I wasn\u0027t. But Ivy and Abby got it in their heads that they wanted a fortune told - mine - and they dragged me there.\"\\n\\n \"Did you tell her about my condition? Did she have an antidote for me?\" he asked, hopeful. I could tell that even though he didn\u0027t trust Dr. Meadows, either, he longed for a solution to his lycan transformation.\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t ask. I was afraid if I said anything to her, then she would somehow read my thoughts and figure out you were the werewolf. I didn\u0027t want her to show up at your house with a TV crew.\"\\n\\n He sighed, disappointed, then pushed his dark locks away from his gorgeous face.\\n\\n \"I appreciate that,\" he said. \"What did she say?\"\\n\\n \"\u0027Beware of a bite under a full moon. It will complicate your love life,\u0027\" I recited.\\n\\n Brandon paused. At any moment he was going to confess he had dreams that he was going to bite me. But instead, he only laughed.\\n\\n \"You know it doesn\u0027t mean anything,\" he reassured me, resting his hand on my shoulder. \"Why are you so worried?\"\\n\\n \"But last time everything she said happened. \u0027Beware of the woods . . . of the sounds of howling.\u0027 Remember? \u0027There could be outsiders who will turn . . . underneath the glow of the full moon.\u0027 I was lost in the woods - and met that pack of wolves. And then you turned underneath the glow - \"\\n\\n \"Of the full moon. I know. But just because she said it didn\u0027t mean it would happen. It could be coincidence,\" he tried to assure me.\\n\\n \"Yes. But when I left there, I got caught in a snowstorm, the full moon came out, you were bitten, and now you are a . . .\"\\n\\n He sighed. \"It\u0027s okay.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know what it means.\" My hands shook and my voice quavered.\\n\\n \"What do you think it means?\" he asked, entertaining my concern.\\n\\n \"That you will bite me and it will come between us.\"\\n\\n \"Now that is ridiculous! Have I bitten you before?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Then why would I now?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know.\" I stared up at the most attractive guy I\u0027d ever encountered, one who was not only handsome but kind. Then I realized I had just told him he might bite me and turn me into a wolfgirl. My love life was spinning out of control.\\n\\n \"Well, now you have me worried.\" He stepped away from me.\\n\\n Getting it off my chest didn\u0027t relieve the burden of Dr. Meadows\u0027s warning like I thought it would; it only made things worse.\\n\\n I bounced over to him - the guy who only a moment ago was sporting an infectious smile now was wearing a frown. \"Like you told me,\" I began, \"what she says can be baloney. And if it is true, well, who knows what it means? Maybe I\u0027ll bite you,\" I teased.\\n\\n \"I never figured moving here would be so complicated. So much has happened in such a short time. I figured the biggest thing I\u0027d have to deal with was making friends. Now it seems like the last thing on my mind.\"\\n\\n \"And you should have friends. You should have me, Ivy, and Abby.\"\\n\\n \"I appreciate it - but like I said, that\u0027s the last thing I\u0027m concerned with now. I want to fix this situation so we can be together.\"\\n\\n \"I do, too.\"\\n\\n \"But now, with a prediction that I might bite you? The last person I\u0027d ever want to hurt?\"\\n\\n I hated that I put that thought in Brandon\u0027s mind. My need for him to reassure me only made him the one who needed to be reassured now.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re right,\" I pressed. \"You haven\u0027t bitten me before. In fact, you\u0027ve been so gentle, I long for those nights when there is a full moon. If you were harmful, I wouldn\u0027t be standing here right now.\" I put my hand on his shoulder. \"I didn\u0027t mean to come over here and add more stress to the situation. I came here to be with you.\"\\n\\n I leaned into him and slid my hands around his back, still gripping my flowers. I clung to him as if I\u0027d never let go.\\n\\n He laid his head on my shoulder. I could feel his smooth cheek against my own and knew that by the next full moon his face would be ripe with facial hair and a goatee. This threat of his lycan condition was once again spoiling our moments together.\\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t we forget about things for a bit?\" he asked, raising his head and taking a deep breath.\\n\\n \"Sure.\" I held the flowers close to me.\\n\\n It was still chilly, but we walked up to the hilltop and hiked through the woods. Brandon was so stunningly gorgeous I couldn\u0027t take my eyes off of him. I had to squeeze his hands extra hard just to believe that this hot guy was indeed standing beside me. In the woods, alone, there was nothing that could come between us and no one we had to hide from. We could truly be ourselves. And even though Brandon wasn\u0027t in werewolf form, he had a heightened sense of our surroundings. He pointed to a pack of deer before they came into view. They were beautiful, hopping over branches and following one another in the woods.\\n\\n Finally we rested at the foot of a tree by the stream. The water was cold but not frozen. It babbled so calmly that it was like the soothing sounds Dr. Meadows had playing in her store. It was wonderful to experience the sight of the flowing water in addition to the relaxing sounds of the stream.\\n\\n Brandon pulled me to him. \"Everything is so peaceful here,\" he said.\\n\\n \"I know. I wish we could stay forever.\"\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s,\" he said dreamily. \"We\u0027ll set up a tent back here.\"\\n\\n \"And we\u0027ll live in it together.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll make our own food and walk together during the day.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027d never get bored,\" I said.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think so, either. There would be so much to do. You could write your stories.\"\\n\\n \"And in the winter we could find a frozen pond where you could play hockey.\"\\n\\n \"We could be nature-schooled,\" he joked.\\n\\n \"Doesn\u0027t that sound awesome?\" I said, resting my head on his leg.\\n\\n Brandon fingered my hair, and I cozied up against him. Soon we were lost in each other\u0027s lips.\\n\\n \"I am really happy I came here,\" he said.\\n\\n \"To this stream?\" I asked, dizzy from his kisses.\\n\\n \"No, to Legend\u0027s Run.\"\\n\\n \"Even with all its complications?\"\\n\\n \"Well, I could do without some,\" he teased, \"but yes, even with those.\"\\n\\n \"So you don\u0027t miss Miller\u0027s Glen?\" I asked. \"Not even a little bit? I can\u0027t imagine leaving my home and my friends.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, I miss my friends. I was planning on going back for a visit, but I don\u0027t think so now - not with the whole moon-changing events.\"\\n\\n \"So you can\u0027t go back?\"\\n\\n \"Not with an impending full moon.\"\\n\\n I was relieved that he wasn\u0027t planning on leaving town anytime soon. But I also felt lonely for him - I was his only friend in Legend\u0027s Run. It only made me hug and kiss him more.\\n\\n \"Besides,\" he said, staring at me. \"Nothing would take me away from you now. Not ever.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/magic-of-the-moonlight-full-moon-2/page-5.html","bookId":2149,"book":{"id":2149,"title":"Magic of the Moonlight (Full Moon #2)","description":"Storyline: Magic of the Moonlight (Full Moon #2) \\n Beware of a bite under a full moon… \\n it will complicate your love life. \\n Celeste has more to worry about than a secret romance with a hot guy from the wrong side of town.
