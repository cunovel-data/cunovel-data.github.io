{"id":96459,"no":19,"title":"Page 19","content":"The following day, the town was abuzz with the Moonlight Dance fiasco. Apparently once the alarm was disabled, the dance continued, but not without much gossiping about the astonishing event. Ivy and Abby texted and called me after the dance, and I assured them I was okay and agreed we\u0027d meet at the coffee shop in the afternoon.\n Nash spotted me outside my house as I was heading over to catch up with my girlfriends.\n Back in his human form, he looked disheveled and tired. Normally the handsome jock was pretty immaculate and clean in his preppy threads and gelled hair. But I found him at the end of my driveway in a T-shirt and jeans and with scratches on his arms and face.\n \"I don\u0027t know what happened last night,\" he said, almost shaking. \"Everyone is looking at me strangely and calling me Wolf Boy. What\u0027s happening to me?\"\n I hadn\u0027t seen Nash this scared since he was attacked by the wolf in the park.\n \"I can\u0027t tell you now,\" I said. I was afraid to add more pain to him in his already anxious state.\n \"They are saying I\u0027m a wolfman. Just like we teased Brandon. But I don\u0027t know why. Why me?\" His torment was palpable.\n \"Where did you get those scratches?\" I asked.\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" he said as truthfully as I\u0027d ever heard him. \"I need your help. You are the only one I feel safe with. You are the only one who really knows me - and can tell me what happened last night.\"\n I patted him on the arm, hoping to comfort him. \"Do you remember being at the dance at all?\" I asked.\n \"I only remember getting ready. It got dark and I felt ill. Then I woke up outside my house. I guess I passed out from partying?\" He looked to me for an answer, but even though he didn\u0027t remember, I knew he sensed he wasn\u0027t out partying.\n \"Please, Celeste. You have to help me. I\u0027m not a bad guy. I need to know what is going on with me,\" he pleaded. \"I\u0027m afraid I might hurt someone.\"\n That was a game changer. It was one thing to see my friend struggle with not knowing what was going on, but if he wasn\u0027t remembering what was happening, how could he control what he was doing? He was a far different werewolf than Brandon was, and that meant I had to keep not only the town safe but Nash as well.\n There was only one solution to help Nash. He had to remember. Then he could decide what to do with his condition. And there was only one way for him to remember.\n \"You will have to meet me at Willow Park tonight,\" I instructed. \"By the lake. You must promise. Just before sunset.\"\n \"Okay,\" he said. \"I really appreciate this, Celeste.\"\n He leaned in for a hug, and I gave him a warm one.\n \"It\u0027s the only way for you to remember,\" I said as he got back into his Beemer.\n \"Remember what?\" he asked as he shut the door.\n Ivy and Abby were already waiting for me at the coffee shop by the time I arrived.\n \"What is going on?\" Ivy asked.\n \"Nash is a werewolf!\" Abby said. \"And so is Brandon.\"\n \"No they aren\u0027t. They both were pranking us!\" Ivy said. \"Why do you fall for everything?\"\n \"Because it\u0027s true. I saw it with my own two eyes. And so did the whole school!\"\n Ivy was skeptical, like I\u0027d been when I first saw Brandon. Since Nash spent most of his time pranking us and our schoolmates, it was reasonable to believe this was a prank, too. But Brandon? I wasn\u0027t sure what to tell my friends.\n \"Half the town agrees with me that it was a prank,\" Ivy said proudly.\n \"And the other half agrees with me,\" Abby argued. \"We have werewolves in Legend\u0027s Run, and we saw two of them last night!\"\n I was disheartened. Even though I wasn\u0027t thirsty, I ordered some coffee to give myself something to distract me from my friends\u0027 conversation.\n Abby turned to me. \"Well, what do you think, Celeste? You were close enough to Brandon and Nash to see everything. Were they wearing makeup?\"\n \"Uh . . . of course they were!\" Ivy interjected.\n \"Let her answer,\" Abby insisted. \"Were they, Celeste?\"\n Ivy huffed. \"Leave her alone. The two guys were fighting over her last night. She\u0027s exhausted.\"\n I was, but my day wasn\u0027t over. In fact it was only beginning.\n \"See, this is why I tried to tell you to date Eastsiders,\" Ivy lamented. \"See how much trouble has happened? I have to know, Celeste. It may sound crazy. But I saw what I saw. And everyone is talking about it. Are you dating two werewolves?\" she asked.\n \"No. I\u0027m only dating one,\" I said.\n They both were in shock and then began cracking up. And finally I, too, joined in. For the next hour we rehashed the bizarre events that had taken place last night, and for now my friends seemed keen on accepting those events of the Moonlight Dance as a prank.\n It was late afternoon when I arrived at Brandon\u0027s house and found a car already parked in the driveway. Apollo was barking in the window.\n A lady opened the car door, and it was then I noticed her long gray hair.\n \"Dr. Meadows - what are you doing here?\" I asked, hopping out of my car.\n \"I\u0027m friends with Officer Nichols,\" she whispered. \"He told me what happened at the dance last night. He believed it to be a prank - but I knew better. Brandon is a werewolf.\"\n I had enough on my plate without Dr. Meadows getting in the way of my helping Nash remember his transformation and curing Brandon\u0027s lycan condition.\n \"It\u0027s a full moon,\" she said. \"I want to see what happens.\"\n \"You have to leave,\" I insisted. I was going to block her way if I had to.\n Brandon stepped out of the house. \"May I help you?\" Brandon asked.\n \"I\u0027m here to visit your grandparents,\" Dr. Meadows said. \"But it is you I really wanted to talk to. I\u0027m Dr. Meadows.\"\n Brandon\u0027s face perked up. \"Dr. Meadows?\"\n \"Yes. I want to talk to you about a few things.\"\n \"I can\u0027t,\" he said. \"Not tonight.\"\n \"Oh . . . but it must be tonight.\"\n \"We have a date,\" Brandon said.\n \"But this won\u0027t take long,\" she said, noticing the sun beginning to set.\n \"We really have to go - perhaps another time,\" I said. I pulled Brandon into my car and drove out of the driveway.\n I peeked in the rearview mirror and noticed she was scrambling to get into her car.\n \"She wants to see you turn,\" I said.\n \"We can\u0027t let her.\"\n \"I know!\"\n I drove around a few bends and could tell she was following us.\n \"We have to lose her,\" I said. I felt like I was in an action movie. But in a movie, I had the safety of my couch or theater seat. Here, I was in the car, and I was the one driving.\n \"Just be careful,\" he said, looking out the back window. \"Drive like you would normally and I\u0027ll tell you when to pull off. I know a few back roads.\"\n I was scared to think that Dr. Meadows would see Brandon\u0027s transformation. If she had a camera or video, she would also have proof of the lycan event. It would change everything for Brandon if the town had proof he was a werewolf.\n I continued to drive steadily, like I normally did, and tried to remain calm, but my hands were warm around the steering wheel. My nerves were getting the best of me.\n \"She\u0027s still there,\" I said, glancing in my rearview mirror.\n \"Yes,\" he said, \"but she won\u0027t be for long.\"\n \"What are we going to do? Where are we going?\"\n \"Just a minute . . .\" he said. And then, \"Now! Turn off here.\" He pointed to a gravel road.\n I quickly made the turn.\n \"Now give it some gas!\"\n I pressed my foot on the accelerator, and dust from the road kicked up into a cloud behind us.\n \"I can\u0027t see her; is she there?\" I asked as we raced on.\n \"No, she didn\u0027t follow us. But if she turns around, she might find us,\" he said. \"We have to drive a little farther until we come to a fork.\"\n It wasn\u0027t long before I saw the road splinter off into two directions like Brandon said it would. \"Which way do we go?\"\n \"The left one.\"\n We headed onto another gravel road and found ourselves deep in the back country of Legend\u0027s Run. Eventually Brandon told me to stop.\n \"I\u0027ve never done that before,\" I said, my heart pounding almost loud enough to hear.\n \"Hopefully we won\u0027t have to do it again.\"\n \"It was so exciting!\" I tried to catch my breath.\n The dust settled, and Dr. Meadows\u0027s car was nowhere in sight. \"You are amazing!\" I exclaimed. My friends barely knew the main road on the west side of town, so it was thrilling to know someone who only lived here a short time but knew his way around the back roads of the town I was born in.\n \"If we continue on, this road dumps out a half a mile from the park,\" Brandon told me.\n I took a breath and continued driving. It was then I realized the other threat, the one we were originally dealing with today - Nash\u0027s transformation.\n \"Nash is going to hurt someone if he doesn\u0027t know what he is doing,\" I told Brandon. \"You saw him at the dance. He doesn\u0027t remember his actions. I think he destroyed the baseball storage shed the first night he turned. You saw how he was at the dance - stalking and preying on me. He\u0027s not like you. It affects him differently. He becomes an untamed animal.\" I paused for a second and then told Brandon what I planned to do. \"I think the only way that I can help him remember is to do what I did for you - to kiss him under the full moon.\"\n With Nash not remembering the events that took place when he was a werewolf, it was up to me and Brandon to tell or not to tell him what happened. There was only one way to break the spell of not remembering - what Dr. Meadows had warned me against. Kissing a werewolf. I didn\u0027t want to do it - I wasn\u0027t dating him anymore, and it felt wrong to consider kissing him again. It wasn\u0027t like he wasn\u0027t the hottest Eastsider in school; it was just that I\u0027d fallen in love with the hottest Westsider.\n But Brandon wasn\u0027t so eager for me to trade my affections for Nash\u0027s benefit. \"Are you kidding?\"\n \"No,\" I said.\n \"I can\u0027t stand by and watch you kiss another guy.\"\n \"I\u0027m not asking you to - \"\n \"So you want me to leave you alone with him?\"\n \"No . . . I just mean it\u0027s the only way to cure him from not remembering. And if I don\u0027t - you saw him last night.\"\n \"I know, I know.\" He looked away.\n \"But it\u0027ll tear me apart to know you\u0027re kissing another guy.\" He was forlorn, and I, too, felt awful.\n \"I\u0027ll make it quick,\" I said as he turned back to me. \"It\u0027ll be like kissing a friend.\"\n \"I can\u0027t even think about it,\" he said with a snarl. \"But if he remembers, he won\u0027t attack you again.\"\n \"That\u0027s what I hope,\" I said.\n \"But maybe I will,\" he teased.\n We both laughed but knew that the situation was awkward, to say the least. The sooner we got there, the sooner I could help Nash and be back in Brandon\u0027s arms.\n When we arrived at Willow Park, I checked in the rearview mirror and didn\u0027t see Dr. Meadows\u0027s car.\n \"We lost her for good,\" I said.\n Brandon and I jogged to the lake, hoping to reach it before the sun fully set.\n \"You better make this quick,\" Brandon warned. \"Just a peck. Like you\u0027d kiss a friend.\"\n \"Okay, I promise,\" I said.\n Brandon kissed me for a long time, and then stepped into the brush.\n I found Nash leaning against a tree by the lake. The setting sun shimmered against the water. He almost seemed startled when he caught sight of me approaching. It was as if he was surprised that I showed up.\n \"I\u0027m glad you came,\" he said, relieved. \"I wasn\u0027t sure - \"\n \"I know,\" I said. \"I\u0027m here.\"\n \"You really are the one person I can count on. You always have been. I really mean it, Celeste.\" He took my hand in his. \"It\u0027s always been you. I guess I focused too much on myself and not enough on you. I don\u0027t know, maybe I didn\u0027t think we should be so serious, since we are still young. But I was wrong to do so. You\u0027ve always been my best friend - and more than that . . . you are the only one for me. And you always will be.\"\n His kind words were sincere, and I believed them. Nash was charming, but he wasn\u0027t dishonest. The fact that he now recognized what our problems were spoke volumes to me of how he was really changing in a mature way. But had I not met Brandon, Nash would still be talking about his scores instead of his love for me. And had I not met Brandon, I might still be dating the athletic Eastsider instead of being in love with the outdoorsy Westsider.\n The sun set and the full moon lit up the sky behind him.\n \"I\u0027m so hot!\" Nash said suddenly.\n He dropped my hand and began to rip off his shirt.\n I knew what was happening, but that didn\u0027t make me any less afraid for him and the situation.\n \"I\u0027m freaking boiling!\" he exclaimed as he threw off his shoes and socks.\n \"I know,\" I said helplessly. \"It will be okay.\"\n Nash fell to his knees, and his eyes turned blue gray. He shuddered and managed to rise and stumble behind a tree.\n Just then I heard the howling of two wolves.\n Nash returned, his normally gelled, flaxen hair untamed and hanging to his shoulders. His blue-gray eyes bore through the darkness. He was attractive and muscular and had sexy sideburns and wild blond hair on his face and chest.\n I still was slightly scared, but Brandon was only a few yards away if anything got out of hand.\n I knew what I had to do. It was imperative that Nash not spend another night as a werewolf, not remembering his actions. But this was the same werewolf that had tried to attack me last night and the one before.\n \"Nash - \" I said. \"I need you to remain calm. It\u0027s just me, Celeste. Your best friend.\"\n Nash remained by the tree and breathed heavily.\n \"I don\u0027t want you to hurt me,\" I said, my voice quivering. \"And I know you don\u0027t want to. You want us to be together.\"\n I inched toward my former boyfriend. He didn\u0027t retreat or charge me. Instead he appeared accepting.\n I reached out my hand, and he growled. I did my best not to run or freak out. When he extended his hand to me, I felt slightly more comfortable.\n I took his hand, which was warmer and stronger than normal. I looked up at him under the moonlight like I had so many times when we were dating, but this time a werewolf stared back at me. So much guilt raced through me. First getting Brandon in this situation and now Nash. I was here to do something to try to ease the situation as best as I could.\n Nash\u0027s hair hung in his face and on his shoulders. His blue-gray eyes softened as I continued to hold his hand. \"It\u0027s okay,\" I said in a whisper. \"I\u0027m not going to run away tonight. It\u0027s the only way you\u0027ll remember.\"\n Then I leaned in and he did the same.\n I kissed him full on the mouth, our lips pressed together like they had many times before. His lips were even more riveting and tender than the kisses we\u0027d shared when we were dating. But even though this kiss would be memorable, there was still something deep down inside me that was missing. He had been my first crush, but even in this powerful state, he still wasn\u0027t my first love. Tears welled in my eyes as I knew I felt as much for him as I could. And I was now ready for it to end.\n I quickly pulled away to find Brandon standing next to me. His wolf eyes were intense and his fangs were shining. He was scowling angrily, and I wasn\u0027t sure what to do. Had I finally brought out the animal in Brandon, too? Maybe it hadn\u0027t been right to have kissed Nash. In Brandon\u0027s normal state, he might have dealt with it - but now he was alone in the woods with another werewolf, and perhaps I\u0027d made a horrible mistake.\n Instead of running to Brandon, I inched back. When he saw the fear in my eyes, his intense expression softened.\n \"It\u0027s over - \" I said. \"Now Nash will remember. And he\u0027ll remember I\u0027m with you,\" I said, and raced into his arms.\n Nash was dazed. He stumbled for a few seconds and then stared at both Brandon and me. Brandon then blocked me from Nash\u0027s view. But instead of challenging Brandon, Nash just smiled a huge, shifty smile, wolf fangs shimmering. He roared a wildly enthusiastic howl and tore off into the woods.\n Brandon growled and turned around to face me. He gazed down like I was a small animal he wanted to protect. I leaned into Brandon, all the tension from my body caving into him. I would never stop caring for Nash. He was my friend and an attractive guy, to say the least, and I wanted the best for him. But I also wanted the best for me. And that meant being with Brandon.\n \"From now on,\" he said, staring down at me with his sexy gray eyes, \"I\u0027m the only one who\u0027s going to be kissing you.\"\n Brandon swooped me up in his arms and passionately kissed me with the power of a hot, handsome, and heroic werewolf.\n Even though I was happy, I knew Brandon and I still had our challenges ahead. There were two werewolves in Legend\u0027s Run now. I had dated one and was in love with the other. And with the high school witnessing both, I knew we all weren\u0027t out of the woods yet.\n But for now, I enjoyed kissing the werewolf I was in love with, the magnetic one with irresistible lips, a howling heart, and superhuman strength, who loved me just as I loved him, among the trees and underneath the glow of the full moon. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/magic-of-the-moonlight-full-moon-2/page-19.html","bookId":2149,"book":{"id":2149,"title":"Magic of the Moonlight (Full Moon #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Magic of the Moonlight (Full Moon #2) \n Beware of a bite under a full moon… \n it will complicate your love life. \n Celeste has more to worry about than a secret romance with a hot guy from the wrong side of town.
