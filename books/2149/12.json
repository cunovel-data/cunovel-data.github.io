{"id":96452,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"I spent the next day, Sunday, inside, worried and exhausted from last night\u0027s events. Everything I was doing seemed to be bringing harm to others - Brandon saving me in the woods and now Nash following me, both resulting in them being attacked by wolves. I didn\u0027t have the strength to leave my home, and at this point I wasn\u0027t sure if I should. I used the time to regroup and hope that my lack of presence would ensure no one was harmed. The following day at school, Nash was greeted by the student body as if he were a hero. The story that floated around the hallways, locker rooms, and classes, and took on a life of its own, was that Nash had saved me from the wolf and was bitten in the process. He held out his bandaged arm like a warrior on a battlefield. Nash was getting the acclaim Brandon deserved. Both times. It was Brandon who\u0027d saved me from a wolf pack when I was lost in the woods, and it was Brandon again who\u0027d saved Nash from an attacking wolf. And somehow, Nash got the credit. But I knew it wasn\u0027t a good idea to tell anyone what really happened - especially that Brandon was a werewolf. \"Brandon saved your life,\" I said to Nash later that day. \"How are you so sure? Maybe he was the one who sent the wolf out there.\" \"How can you even think that? The wolf was stalking a deer. Brandon helped you!\" \"And how can you be so naive? You saw how he was . . . he\u0027s not human.\" I was fuming. I knew it was his pride that kept him from admitting the truth: that because he didn\u0027t believe me he stumbled, and the wolf, feeling threatened, attacked him. \"Are you okay?\" Ivy asked Nash when she got to class. \"Celeste called me from the hospital.\" Nash flashed his bandaged arm like a medal. \"I can\u0027t believe you were bitten,\" Abby said, examining the bandage. \"Maybe it really was a werewolf,\" Dylan added. \"A picnic in the woods,\" Ivy said. \"How romantic. But no wonder you came across a wolf. Haven\u0027t you ever heard of a restaurant?\" \"Maybe Nash should stick to movies,\" Jake said. I was about to tell my friends right there and then that it was Brandon who had saved us from the wolf when my hero entered the classroom. Brandon locked gazes with me as he took his seat. The girls continued to coo over Nash\u0027s wound as Nash turned back to Brandon and gave him a thankful nod. After class, Brandon gestured for me to meet him. I gathered my books and told my friends I\u0027d catch up to them and found him waiting for me underneath the staircase. \"My dad left today for Europe,\" he said. \"He\u0027s going to try to make an antidote.\" \"That\u0027s great news!\" I said, giving him a hug. \"How long do you think it will take?\" \"It will take a while, but he said he\u0027d check on me and let me know as soon as he has something.\" \"That\u0027s terrific!\" I said. I snuggled up to Brandon. I imagined what our life would be like together without the threat of his transformations. \"I was going to tell my friends about you saving Nash,\" I said. \"They don\u0027t have to know why or how you saved him, only that you did.\" \"It\u0027s over with now. I\u0027m just glad you\u0027re okay - and that he is, too.\" Brandon\u0027s caring nature made my love for him even deeper. It was then I knew I couldn\u0027t keep the secret any longer. * * * I found Ivy and Abby at a round table in the library. Ivy was fiddling with her makeup, and Abby was working on homework. I didn\u0027t plan on telling them every detail about Brandon and me, but I was bursting to tell them it was him who I was interested in - not Nash. How could I continue to keep this a secret when my heart was going to explode with love every time I saw or even thought of him? And to see Nash parade himself around school as a self-proclaimed hero when in fact he\u0027d have been torn to shreds if it hadn\u0027t been for Brandon? I was sure Nash wouldn\u0027t tell them that it was a werewolf that saved him, but I knew that my former boyfriend wasn\u0027t in the position to publicly disparage Brandon now. There were two witnesses Saturday night who knew who\u0027d really saved him from the attacking wolf. And Nash had more to lose by us telling everyone he wasn\u0027t the hero than Brandon had in Nash proclaiming the Westsider was a werewolf. It was time to come clean. I sat down and was anxiously bouncing in my chair when Abby looked up from her textbook. \"Stop shaking the table,\" she said. \"You\u0027re making me seasick.\" \"I have something to tell you,\" I said intently. \"Wow, Celeste,\" Abby said, \"you look like you have major news.\" \"Are you and Nash engaged?\" Ivy teased, putting her compact in her purse. \"It\u0027s about Brandon,\" I said. \"Brandon?\" Abby asked. \"You want us to invite him somewhere else again?\" Ivy asked. \"I think we\u0027ve done enough babysitting. Besides, Jake is getting really freaked out that we\u0027ve been including him. I think he gets jealous. I mean, he has nothing to worry about, though - as if!\" Ivy was making this difficult confession even more challenging. \"No,\" I said. \"It\u0027s not that.\" \"Then what?\" Abby asked. \"I have a confession.\" \"Oh . . .\" Abby said. \"Sounds serious. What is it?\" \"Did you paint Brandon\u0027s Jeep?\" Ivy asked. \"No!\" I said. \"Then what is it?\" she said, waiting for details. \"I like . . .uh . . . I . . .\" \"Just spill it out!\" Ivy ordered. \"I like Brandon!\" I exclaimed. There it was. I\u0027d laid out my confession to my friends. It was like a huge weight off of me. I only had to wait now for their response. \"Brandon?\" Ivy asked, shocked. \"Duh,\" Abby said. Ivy and I were surprised by Abby\u0027s response. \"What?\" we both said. \"You talk about him all the time,\" Abby said. \"Trying to invite him everywhere we go.\" \"So you knew?\" I asked. \"This is the secret Dr. Meadows told me a friend would be keeping from me!\" Ivy screeched. \"I can\u0027t believe you told Abby first!\" \"She didn\u0027t,\" Abby said in a huff. \"It was intuition - I just knew.\" \"I haven\u0027t told anyone,\" I proclaimed. \"It\u0027s okay,\" Ivy said, resigned. \"We all get crushes on people. And I guess I can see why you\u0027d feel sympathy for your pet project. It\u0027s only natural. I think you\u0027ve got that Stockholm syndrome thing.\" \"It\u0027s more than that,\" I said. \"I\u0027ve been seeing him.\" Both girls gasped. \"What?\" Ivy said. \"What do you mean? You\u0027ve - \" \"Kissed Brandon Maddox?\" Abby asked. \"Girls, keep it down over there - \" the librarian admonished us. I nodded. \"I don\u0027t believe you,\" Ivy said. \"I do,\" Abby said. \"He\u0027s hot - except for being a Westsider and all.\" Abby smiled. There was a tiny rebellious streak that ran through her and, though she\u0027d never be seen dating a Westsider, my news was wildly thrilling to her. \"I can\u0027t believe this,\" Ivy said, trying to process the information. \"But I\u0027m glad you told us right away. We can help you now.\" \"So when did this happen?\" Abby asked. \"Uh . . . a few months ago,\" I said, baring my soul. \"A few months ago?\" Ivy asked, shocked again. I nodded. \"And you didn\u0027t tell me - your best friend since first grade?\" she asked. \"I\u0027m her best friend, too!\" Abby said. \"I can\u0027t believe you!\" Ivy said. \"You\u0027ve been secretly dating Brandon Maddox and you didn\u0027t tell your own best friend?\" \"Best friends,\" Abby reiterated. \"I wanted to - in fact I even tried.\" Abby had a hard time controlling her smile. \"I guess you don\u0027t think that much of me, do you?\" Ivy asked with disappointment in her voice. \"All this time, not saying a word. You obviously don\u0027t think anything of our friendship - or me.\" Ivy was mad - or, rather, disappointed. \"But you always teased him.\" I defended myself. \"How could I?\" \"I don\u0027t know. . . . But you should have.\" Ivy gathered her purse and backpack. \"I don\u0027t care that he\u0027s a Westsider, Celeste. I\u0027ve only wanted what was best for you. So maybe I was wrong. But at least I was honest with you, something you obviously didn\u0027t feel you could be with me.\" \"It didn\u0027t happen like that, Ivy. Let me explain.\" Ivy turned her nose up and stood. \"What are you doing?\" Abby asked. \"I can\u0027t sit here anymore. Not with her.\" \"Ivy,\" I said, \"let\u0027s talk - please.\" But Ivy was inconsolable. I knew enough about her to know she\u0027d need to cool off. But I\u0027d never been the object of her disappointment, and it broke my heart that I now was. If I had it to do over, I would have loved to have told her sooner. But it was her repulsion toward the Westsiders that made it so hard to do. And whenever I\u0027d tried, for some reason I had failed. And with Nash adding his threat to the mix, it had been put off even longer. My stomach was in knots. My best friend since first grade moved over to the other side of the room to be away from me. But, oddly enough, Abby stayed with me. \"She\u0027ll get over it,\" she said. \"Will she?\" I asked. \"I\u0027ve been keeping a secret as well. Just like Dr. Meadows said I would.\" \"You\u0027re going out with a Westsider, too?\" I tried to make myself laugh. \"No!\" Abby said. \"And Ivy will be mad with this one as well.\" \"What is it?\" I asked. \"Since you\u0027ve confessed,\" she said, \"I\u0027ll confess, too.\" She paused. \"But you may be really mad.\" \"Maybe you shouldn\u0027t tell me. I feel upset enough for one day.\" \"But I want to tell you. Promise you won\u0027t be mad?\" \"Uh . . . sure.\" Abby took a deep breath. \"I know who painted Brandon\u0027s Jeep and locker.\" \"Nash?\" She shook her head, then leaned into me and whispered. \"Jake and Dylan.\" \"What?\" I exclaimed. \"I found out a while ago when I saw some paint in Dylan\u0027s car. He promised not to do it again.\" \"Why did they do that?\" \"To get back at Ivy and me. They were jealous of Brandon. Silly, huh?\" \"Why would they be jealous of Brandon?\" \"I guess Dylan felt threatened after Brandon returned Pumpkin. I hugged Brandon in the middle of class, remember? I invited him to my party. Ivy picked him up. It didn\u0027t go over very well. Even Ivy just told you she could tell Jake was jealous.\" \"Wow - I never would have thought it was them.\" \"Are you mad that I didn\u0027t tell you?\" \"No, I understand.\" \"I kind of thought you would - but Ivy, she\u0027s going to be livid.\" \"Yes, I guess she will.\" \"And are you mad at Jake and Dylan? Please don\u0027t be. They were doing it because of us - more so than because of Brandon.\" \"No,\" I said, my spirit still low from Ivy\u0027s anger. \"It wasn\u0027t nice, but they did use water-based paints.\" \"I am so relieved now that I\u0027ve told you.\" \"Me too,\" I said truthfully, even though I felt low. \"That\u0027s what friends are for,\" Abby said. \"Yes, we should have done this a while ago,\" I said, breaking a smile. While Abby tied her hair into a ponytail, I pondered my future with my first best friend. \"Do you think Ivy will ever forgive me?\" I asked. \"Perhaps after she forgives me,\" Abby said. I gazed at my best friend, who had her back to me, while Abby was still focused on me. \"You have to tell me everything,\" she said. \"Where, when, and why? And is Brandon a good kisser?\" I couldn\u0027t help but grin and nodded enthusiastically. \"And most important,\" she asked, \"what are you going to do now?\" Ivy continued to ignore me for the rest of the day. She talked to Abby but shunned me, sat on the opposite end of our lunch table, and didn\u0027t wait for me after any of our classes. I was truly relieved my friends knew about Brandon but upset that Ivy was so angry with me. However, I understood her feelings. And I think she was right to feel them. \"I told Ivy and Abby,\" I said to Brandon after school. \"That I\u0027m a werewolf?\" he asked, surprised. \"No, silly. About us.\" \"What?\" he asked, confused. \"But I thought we were going to wait until I got a cure.\" \"I know. But Nash can\u0027t say anything now. He owes you his life. And he knows we could tell everyone he wasn\u0027t the one who drove the wolf away.\" \"Wow . . .\" he said, the news finally soaking in. \"So you told Ivy and Abby about us?\" he asked, flattered. \"How did they take it? \"Ivy hates me, and Abby admires me.\" \"Well - I\u0027m sorry about Ivy . . . but Abby?\" \"She thinks it\u0027s cool that - in her mind - I\u0027m rebellious. But I\u0027m not being rebellious. I just want to be with you.\" He gave me a squeeze. \"Well, that\u0027s a shame about Ivy,\" he said. \"I\u0027m sure she\u0027ll come around. I guess she really detests Westsiders.\" \"No - it\u0027s me. She\u0027s upset I didn\u0027t think enough of her to share the truth with her right away. I do understand her feelings. And I wanted to tell her sooner - but this town is so divided, and she has always claimed to hate the Westside. I didn\u0027t want her to be mad, and I wound up making her upset anyway.\" \"It\u0027s okay, all of your intentions were good.\" \"I really am sad she\u0027s so upset with me.\" \"Maybe it\u0027s best if you eat lunch with her for a while longer.\" \"What? I thought you\u0027d want us to start doing things together in public.\" \"It can wait. Don\u0027t get me wrong - I\u0027m dying to be with you. But Ivy\u0027s been your best friend since you were kids. It\u0027s better to show allegiance to her than a guy you just met this year.\" \"Are you sure?\" \"Yes. I can wait. But she better get over it soon!\" he said. Brandon not only was a great boyfriend but a great friend, too. For the rest of the day and evening my calls and texts to Ivy remained unanswered. I was wondering when Abby would tell her secret to Ivy, too, and be in the doghouse with me.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/magic-of-the-moonlight-full-moon-2/page-12.html","bookId":2149,"book":{"id":2149,"title":"Magic of the Moonlight (Full Moon #2)","description":"Storyline: Magic of the Moonlight (Full Moon #2) Beware of a bite under a full moon… it will complicate your love life.
