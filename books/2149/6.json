{"id":96446,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"At school on Monday after the party fiasco, I found I was the subject of whispers and mumbling in the school hallways. Though Ivy and Abby were gossips and giggles as usual, Nash, his crew, and other students took Brandon\u0027s showing up to the party and leaving early - with me - as even more of a reason to isolate him. And my leaving with Brandon didn\u0027t go unnoticed by the other members of the once-happy sixsome.\n I figured Nash wouldn\u0027t tell our friends that my reason for taking Brandon home had as much to do with my romantic feelings for him as it did my tendency to help out the underdog. Understandably, Nash wouldn\u0027t want to admit to our group that I was interested in anyone besides him.\n As I met Ivy and Abby and pulled my books from my locker, I noticed students laughing and pointing when they walked by a locker at the end of the first-floor corridor.\n \"What\u0027s up with that?\" I asked Ivy and Abby.\n \"Don\u0027t know,\" Ivy said, almost salivating with interest. \"Let\u0027s check it out.\"\n We approached the small crowd and noticed it was Brandon\u0027s locker they were pointing to. It had the word WOLFMAN painted on it.\n My heart sank. \"This is awful!\" I said.\n \"They aren\u0027t even original,\" Ivy added.\n \"Do you think Nash did this?\" I asked.\n \"I don\u0027t think so . . . but let\u0027s ask him,\" Abby said. She stormed over to him and I followed closely.\n Nash was standing by Heidi Rosen, and that made me even madder. If he was really so anxious to be with me again, he had a strange way of showing it.\n I scooted past Abby and pushed my way between Nash and Heidi.\n \"Did you do that?\" I asked him, point-blank.\n \"Do what?\"\n \"Paint Brandon\u0027s locker.\"\n \"No. Why, does it need painting?\"\n \"It does now.\" I was fuming.\n Just then a crowd began to gather around us, not only Ivy and Abby but Jake and Dylan and a few more nosy members of the student body.\n \"If you didn\u0027t do this, then who did?\" I asked.\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" he said. \"Who am I, Sherlock Holmes?\"\n Heidi laughed an annoying cackle.\n \"Besides, we offered to take him home,\" Nash said. \"Jake and Dylan, too. Wasn\u0027t that nice of us?\"\n \"I think it was really nice,\" Heidi interjected. \"He took me home.\"\n I turned away and headed back to Brandon\u0027s locker.\n \"She\u0027s not even that athletic,\" Abby said, catching me at the locker. \"She can\u0027t do a cartwheel, much less the splits. I don\u0027t know how she\u0027s a cheerleader.\"\n \"Yes,\" Ivy said, \"and I guess you don\u0027t have to take an IQ test to get on the squad.\"\n Even though deep down I wasn\u0027t truly jealous that Nash was hanging out with another girl, it was so nice to have my two friends defend me. I was hoping they\u0027d do the same for Brandon.\n \"I have to go get some towels,\" I said.\n \"Why?\" Ivy asked.\n \"I want to wipe this off.\"\n \"Celeste, you\u0027ll get dirty,\" she said. \"Let the janitor take care of it.\"\n \"I don\u0027t want Brandon to see this. How would you feel if you got to your locker and someone had written WOLFMAN on it?\"\n Ivy thought. \"That wouldn\u0027t make sense. I\u0027m a girl.\"\n But Abby got my point, and I think she still felt indebted to Brandon for rescuing her dog because she said, \"C\u0027mon, Ivy, let\u0027s help.\"\n She and Ivy followed me into the bathroom and grabbed paper towels and soaked half of them in soap and water. We returned to find Jake and Dylan standing by the locker, beaming.\n Abby pushed them aside, and we started to wash the paint off.\n \"What are you doing?\" Jake asked.\n \"What you should be doing,\" Ivy said.\n \"Are you crazy? Stop that.\"\n He tried pulling his girlfriend away from the locker, but she refused.\n \"Get off,\" she said.\n \"You too,\" Dylan said to Abby. \"Someone will see you.\"\n \"I think everyone sees us,\" she said, referring to the small crowd that had gathered around us.\n \"Why are you both defending him, too?\" Jake asked. \"It was wrong of you to bring another dude to the party. Don\u0027t you know how that looks?\"\n \"I invited him,\" Abby said, putting some muscle into her scrubbing.\n \"Fine, you\u0027ve done enough,\" Dylan said. \"But you both are doting on him just as much as Celeste is.\"\n \"Are you crazy?\" Abby asked. \"We are so not.\"\n \"And what if they are?\" I asked.\n Just then I noticed Brandon walking down the hallway. A few howls came from the crowd.\n Brandon looked slightly embarrassed and more than annoyed with the students\u0027 wolf cries. When he approached his locker, we were just finishing up.\n \"What\u0027s going on?\" he asked, upset with what he saw.\n \"We were just cleaning lockers,\" I said. \"It is part of our school renewal program.\"\n \"You girls don\u0027t have to,\" he said.\n \"We\u0027re almost done - \" Abby said.\n \"You are done,\" Dylan directed.\n \"You too,\" Jake added. They took the towels from the girls and led them away from Brandon.\n The crowd dispersed and I stood alone with Brandon, holding the blackened towel in my hand. My hair hung down in my face, and I had a few smudges on my sweater.\n He gently lifted the piece of hair from my face and brushed it back. I felt a million chills surge through me. We locked eyes, and I was sure he was going to kiss me. Right there, in front of his locker, near meandering students, in full view of my friends.\n The bell rang, and the hallway filled with students. Ivy came over to me and guided me back to our lockers. The last thing I was going to focus on was learning academics. There was only one thing I was going to think about and that was Brandon.\n * * *\n After a few more days of the wolf calls, I could see the harassment was taking its toll on Brandon. Though he tried to hide it, he seemed to be a bit agitated and almost depressed. I couldn\u0027t bear silent witness to it any longer.\n \"Where are you going?\" Ivy asked when I didn\u0027t go in the direction of our table.\n \"I think we should sit somewhere else today,\" I said, trying for nonchalance. I acted like it wasn\u0027t a big deal to switch tables.\n \"What?\" Ivy gasped. \"This is our table. We\u0027ve been sitting here for years!\"\n I spun around. \"Why don\u0027t we all sit somewhere else?\" I suggested as if I had a fabulous new idea. \"It would be fun. A brand-new view of the cafeteria, and perhaps we could make new friends.\"\n \"We don\u0027t need new friends,\" she said in a huff.\n \"C\u0027mon. Let\u0027s live on the edge. Just this once.\"\n \"I don\u0027t want to live on the edge,\" Ivy said. She shifted her hips to one side as if her tray were holding heavy textbooks instead of a small salad. \"I want to sit with Jake.\"\n \"Yeah, and I want to sit with Dylan,\" Abby chimed in. \"Don\u0027t you want to hang with Nash?\"\n \"Listen,\" I began in a whisper. \"If we sit with Brandon, whoever is doing this will stop tormenting him.\"\n \"Brandon?\" they exclaimed in unison.\n \"That\u0027s what this is about?\" Ivy wondered.\n \"I already invited him to my party,\" Abby winced. \"Do we have to eat lunch with him, too?\"\n \"You guys are popular,\" I said. \"So if we sit with him, he\u0027ll look cool because he\u0027s with the cool people. Then the spray-painting antics will be over.\"\n \"No, then they\u0027ll be spray painting our lockers as well,\" Ivy said.\n \"They wouldn\u0027t dare,\" I said. \"That\u0027s why this is so easy - \"\n \"Well, you\u0027re popular, too,\" Abby said. \"Why don\u0027t you sit with him?\"\n They both glared at me with razor-sharp eyes, awaiting my answer.\n This was the moment. I could either stand tall or cave in. Be the person I was hoping they\u0027d be or behave as all the other cliques did and simply mind my own business. Ivy and Abby were going to sit by their boyfriends. Perhaps it was time for me to sit by mine.\n \"I think I will.\" The words came out before I had a chance to change my mind.\n I thought Ivy was going to drop her tray from shock. \"Oh, come on,\" she said. \"Are you insane? You could be killed over there!\"\n \"Yeah, it\u0027s totally not safe - or cool,\" Abby advised. \"A party was one thing, but I agree with Dylan, we\u0027ve done enough.\"\n \"I have to sit with Jake,\" Ivy said, \"and Abby sits with Dylan and you with Nash. Let\u0027s go.\" They began to walk away, but I didn\u0027t follow.\n \"Are you coming?\" Abby asked.\n I didn\u0027t move. Instead I turned in the direction of Brandon\u0027s table - the skater table.\n \"Celeste!\" Ivy called. But I didn\u0027t look back.\n \"C\u0027mon, Celeste!\" Abby said. \"We get that you are trying to do the right thing.\"\n But I didn\u0027t join my friends and continued to gaze toward the opposite side of the cafeteria.\n \"Fine.\" Ivy finally resigned. \"We\u0027ll catch up to her after lunch.\"\n \"If she survives the lunch bell,\" Abby said. I could hear their heels clicking against the linoleum floor as they walked to our table.\n At this point, I was no longer worried that my friends would abandon me. I knew they\u0027d just assume I was up to my old goody-two-shoes save-the-world ways. And hadn\u0027t Brandon saved me from the wolves in the woods? This was the least I could do.\n But it was harder than I thought. It would be the first time I sat anywhere else but with my friends. All my high school years were spent in Ivy\u0027s and Abby\u0027s company. Even if one was at home sick, I was by the side of the other. We never stepped foot on the other side of the cafeteria even to throw our trash away. And this time I was not only planning to venture onto their half but actually sit down with one of their own.\n I took a deep breath and walked toward Brandon\u0027s table. At first I went unnoticed. But when I walked past several tables of Eastsiders and crossed into Westsider territory, I began to get stares. I was uncomfortable and my palms grew clammy, the tray beginning to slip and shake in my hand. The spoon for my Jell-O began to rattle, and it only drew attention to how nervous I felt inside. I knew it wasn\u0027t too late to turn back. No one would be the wiser. My friends would greet me with a laugh and a few \"goody-girl\" jabs. The Westsiders would go back to eating their sandwiches and talking about how materialistic we were.\n But I remembered the stares from the wolves in the woods that day when the blizzard blinded me, I was lost, and Brandon saved me. These stares felt just as deadly, but I knew that I wasn\u0027t in any real physical danger now. I had to convince myself that Brandon was there for me - and I had to be there for him. I couldn\u0027t shy away from the unknown but needed to embrace it and have it provide me with strength, just as he had. I took another deep breath; I felt as if I were walking in the wrong part of town. This time I was the outsider, the one who didn\u0027t belong. But I didn\u0027t care. I stood tall and continued on my way, as if I\u0027d been sitting on that side of the cafeteria since I was a freshman.\n I came to the skater table, where Brandon normally sat. Several students eyed me but didn\u0027t say anything - as if my presence was too shocking for words. I set my shaking tray down on the table and I finally plopped down on the bench next to Brandon\u0027s empty seat. I heard several gasps and whispers.\n \"What is Miss Priss doing here?\" Hayley said loud enough for me to hear. Her friends laughed.\n I ignored her.\n \"Don\u0027t you have your own table over there on the Eastside?\" she asked.\n As I opened my lunch, I felt unsettled and understood the loneliness Brandon must have felt eating by himself. The caf was filled with noisy laughing, talking, and eating. Everyone had a pal, a best friend, or a group to chill out with. Not being included or having anyone to even smile at made me feel very self-conscious and hollow inside.\n And then it hit me. What if Brandon didn\u0027t eat in the lunchroom today? What would I do? Would I sit and eat alone the entire lunch bell - or get up to leave early to jeers and howling from Westsiders who thought, to begin with, that my presence must be a joke? I didn\u0027t want to become the laughingstock of Legend\u0027s Run. The last thing I felt like doing was eating my lunch - my stomach was flip-flopping with nerves - but I knew I had to do something other than sit and stare back at the glaring eyeballs.\n My sandwich felt rotten as it hit the pit of my stomach, but I continued to chew and swallow another bite. Finally I spotted Brandon coming into the lunchroom.\n I breathed a sigh of relief.\n Brandon caught sight of me and appeared just as shocked as the others. But instead of making remarks and scowling, his face brightened. He headed over with all lunchroom eyes on him and sat down next to me.\n \"What are you doing here?\" he asked with a smooth, sultry voice.\n \"I was tired of watching you get teased. Now maybe it will stop.\"\n He glanced around. Everyone was looking at us, especially my friends at my table, but I continued to eat my lunch as if we were the only ones in the lunchroom.\n Brandon didn\u0027t know what to do. It wasn\u0027t the reaction I\u0027d expected.\n \"It\u0027s okay,\" I said. \"You can eat, too.\"\n \"Did you tell your friends about us?\" he whispered.\n \"No.\"\n \"Then what\u0027s up?\" he asked. \"Why the sudden change in seating?\"\n \"I wanted Ivy, Abby, and me to sit with you. If everyone saw us hanging out with you, then I thought . . .\"\n \"The hazing would stop?\"\n \"I thought it might.\"\n \"But Ivy and Abby didn\u0027t go for it?\" he said with a smile.\n I shook my head.\n \"That\u0027s really cool.\"\n \"That they didn\u0027t?\"\n \"No, that you did. That was really cool.\" He locked eyes with me.\n I could kiss you right now, his gaze spoke to me. I blushed and turned to my food.\n He opened his bag and pulled out two overstuffed sandwiches. Ever since Brandon had become a werewolf, his eating habits had taken on a new life. He ate three times the normal amount of food a typical student would eat.\n He scooted his leg next to mine so they were touching. No one in the cafeteria knew our little secret. I was tingly and so distracted that I could barely eat my lunch.\n I was hoping we\u0027d be able to get through lunch without incident, but deep down I knew that wasn\u0027t going to happen.\n Nash approached the table and stood across from me and Brandon. Jake and Dylan flanked him on either side.\n \"What\u0027s up, Wolfie?\" Nash said.\n \"Nash, please,\" I said.\n \"Just wanted to see what the Wolfman eats for lunch. Deer meat? Or are you a vegan werewolf?\"\n \"Stop it, Nash.\"\n \"Have to get a girl to fight your battles?\" Nash said coldly.\n Brandon tensed up. \"You mean your girl?\" he muttered under his breath.\n \"What did you say?\" Nash asked.\n \"Celeste is welcome to sit wherever she likes,\" Brandon said. \"I don\u0027t own her, and neither do you.\"\n \"Listen, bud,\" Nash said, leaning in so only Brandon and I could hear. \"I know what I saw that night. I can turn you in to the zoo sooner rather than later.\"\n Brandon leaned in, too. \"Well, if you do believe you saw something, then you better watch your back. A full moon is coming.\"\n For a moment they continued to stare at each other, like two wolves ready for a fight.\n \"Stop it - both of you,\" I finally said.\n Mrs. Dent, our lunchroom monitor, must have noticed the rising tensions and came over to our table.\n \"Is everything all right here?\" she asked.\n \"Uh . . . yes,\" Nash said. \"I was just making sure our friend here had enough to eat.\"\n \"Well, the lunch period is almost over,\" she said.\n \"We were just leaving,\" my former boyfriend replied.\n Before he left, Nash shot me a cold stare that chilled my veins. Dylan and Jake followed him back to my friends\u0027 table.\n \"I guess this wasn\u0027t a good idea,\" I said, frustrated with myself. \"The bullying didn\u0027t stop. I might have made it worse. I thought I was doing the right thing.\"\n \"You were,\" Brandon said, squeezing my knee. \"You were.\"\n The bell rang, and I threw my remaining lunch in the trash. I hadn\u0027t been able to eat much. I\u0027d have to wait until after school to have a snack. But if my stomach still felt as upset as it was now, I wouldn\u0027t have much of an appetite then, either.\n Ivy caught up to me by the cafeteria exit and took me by the hand, leading me away from Brandon.\n \"Okay, community service time is over,\" she said as she yanked me into the crowd of students leaving the lunchroom.\n When fifth bell was finally over, Nash was waiting for me outside my classroom.\n \"What was that about?\" he asked, sliding up close to me. \"Are you trying to embarrass me?\"\n \"You mean lunch?\" I asked.\n \"Uh . . . yeah. I know we aren\u0027t back together, but are you trying to play a trick on me?\"\n \"Of course not, Nash,\" I said sincerely. \"I wanted to show solidarity. That whoever is tormenting him - it needs to stop.\"\n \"You think it\u0027s me,\" he said as if he was genuinely hurt.\n \"No. You said you didn\u0027t write that on his Jeep and I believe you. But that means someone else did. So I\u0027m doing it to stop them.\"\n He shook his head at me in frustration.\n \"What?\" I said. \"I\u0027d do the same for you - only you don\u0027t need it. You are popular and everyone in school loves you.\"\n \"I know. I know you\u0027d do the same for me. That\u0027s why you are so cool.\"\n I was thrilled by Nash\u0027s compliment. It was weird feeling I understood him more than the other girls at Legend\u0027s Run. And that he in turn saw me differently, too.\n \"I guess I just wish this time that I was the new kid in school - that you wanted to sit with me,\" he confessed as students walked by.\n Nash\u0027s admission went straight to my heart. For a moment, he wasn\u0027t masking himself with the bravado of a high school jock but rather letting me into his soul.\n \"Well, it didn\u0027t seem to work as well as I\u0027d like. I might have caused Brandon more trouble. I\u0027ll be returning to our table tomorrow.\"\n Nash turned serious. \"Uh . . . things might be different there, too.\"\n \"What do you mean?\"\n \"You put me in a bind - in front of our friends and the whole school. I now know you were doing what you thought was right - but it looks like you left me for Brandon - a Westsider, no less.\" He shook his head again in frustration. \"Maybe I need to show you what you are really missing by making the choices you are making. By choosing the wrong side. But mostly the wrong guy.\" Nash\u0027s voice wasn\u0027t threatening but rather low and sultry. And his expression was soft and sincere. If he\u0027d been this attentive before, perhaps we\u0027d be together now.\n Nash was fighting for me as much out of pride as for the deep and true feelings I sensed he had for me. There was a slight part of me that was attracted to that - as much I\u0027d been attracted to him in the first place. But as Nash smiled and walked away, I realized that Brandon didn\u0027t have to change to be the guy I loved. He already was that way, naturally.\n The following day, when the lunch bell rang, I wasn\u0027t sure which table I should sit at. If I sat with Brandon, there would be more confrontation, and if I sat with my friends, Nash would feel that he won his battle.\n As I walked into the lunchroom with Ivy and Abby, I wondered what Nash had planned to convince me I was making the wrong choices in guys. I wasn\u0027t expecting flowers or a ring, but I was wondering what the handsome jock had in mind. I was also slightly nervous that he would use Brandon\u0027s lycan identity in hopes of getting my clique on his side. It was then I saw Nash already hanging out at our table - with his arm around Heidi Rosen. Before I knew it, she sat down in my spot - the seat that I\u0027d been sitting in since freshman year.\n I was being replaced by Heidi Rosen? He hadn\u0027t told my friends about Brandon being a werewolf. Instead he was doing something strong to let me know what I was missing being without him. Though we\u0027d been on and off before, Nash didn\u0027t ever have a girlfriend that he\u0027d brought to our table.\n Ivy noticed Heidi, too. \"What is she doing in your seat?\"\n \"We\u0027ll get to the bottom of this,\" Abby said.\n My best friends stormed over to our table and faced Nash.\n \"That\u0027s Celeste\u0027s seat,\" Abby said.\n \"But she\u0027s not sitting here anymore,\" he said.\n \"Uh . . . yes, she is,\" Ivy said.\n \"Then she can sit there,\" he said, pointing to the empty space on the other side of Heidi. \"You know how she likes to make new friends.\"\n My two friends stormed back to me. \"She won\u0027t budge,\" Ivy said. \"Maybe if we had a crane - \"\n \"Or a pack of cigarettes,\" Abby said. \"I get secondhand smoke just from looking at her.\"\n \"It\u0027s okay,\" I said. Since I really liked Brandon, it wasn\u0027t my place to make a fuss about Nash hanging out with another girl.\n \"I can\u0027t believe him,\" Abby said. \"He must really be jealous that you were kind to Brandon.\"\n \"He invited her to sit with us,\" Ivy said. \"He didn\u0027t ask us, she just sat down, right in the spot that is yours! I know I\u0027m going to lose my lunch.\"\n \"She\u0027s all about herself,\" Abby said. \"Just like every other girl he dates. Except you. Don\u0027t you see that\u0027s why you belong together?\"\n \"It\u0027s all right,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll sit somewhere else.\"\n \"But you can\u0027t. You\u0027ll sit next to me and Dylan,\" Abby offered.\n \"No,\" Ivy interjected. \"By me and Jake.\"\n \"I suggested it first,\" Abby said.\n \"But Celeste might want to sit with us, too,\" Ivy said to Abby as if I wasn\u0027t standing there. \"We\u0027ll let her decide.\"\n My friends looked to me to make a choice between them, putting me more on the spot than I already was.\n I didn\u0027t mind so much being the odd girl out, but I did mind having my spot taken in such a brazen manner. I wasn\u0027t in the mood to fight, and I didn\u0027t want to use Brandon as a weapon and eat with him to get back at Nash.\n \"Thanks. You both are the best,\" I said truthfully. \"But I think I want to eat alone.\"\n \"You have to eat with us,\" Ivy said. \"We\u0027ve eaten together for years!\"\n \"Yes, this is your table,\" Abby said. \"I don\u0027t mind getting in his face for real this time,\" she offered.\n But that was what Nash wanted. He wanted to be fought over. I could have hung out at the table with them and shown him that it didn\u0027t upset me, but I was too tired. By sitting with Brandon yesterday, I was trying to show anyone who was bothering him that he did have friends - even if it was only me. But today, Nash was trying to get back at me. And he\u0027d think he won - even if it was a contest that I wasn\u0027t really participating in.\n \"You can\u0027t sit with another guy at a table in front of the whole school without Nash getting worked up,\" Ivy said.\n \"I was just trying to help - \" I began.\n \"We know. But that\u0027s not what it looked like to him,\" she added.\n I couldn\u0027t sit at our table with Heidi Rosen sitting in my seat. And I wasn\u0027t in the mood to march over and demand that she sit somewhere else. \"It would be too awkward,\" I said. \"But I also can\u0027t sit with Brandon. I\u0027ve caused him enough trouble.\"\n \"I\u0027d sit with you somewhere else,\" Abby said, \"but I\u0027d like to hang out with Dylan. I haven\u0027t seen him all day.\"\n \"I understand,\" I said. Although I wasn\u0027t sure if I did. I hadn\u0027t eaten with my true love the last few months so I could avoid turmoil with my friends. My friends couldn\u0027t miss a day for me?\n Ivy didn\u0027t say anything. She didn\u0027t have to.\n \"It\u0027s okay,\" I said to her. \"I\u0027ll see you after lunch.\"\n \"You have to eat with us!\" she begged. \"It\u0027s what Nash really wants.\"\n \"Why do I have to do everything for Nash?\" I asked.\n Ivy was hurt. \"Everything is changing!\" she exclaimed as if her world were crumbling down around her. \"You have to stop being Mother Teresa.\"\n I didn\u0027t understand this whole clique mentality. If I had my way, everyone in the school would just sit at one big table.\n \"Where are you going to eat?\" she asked, worried.\n \"I may just go to the library and read. I\u0027m not very hungry anyway.\"\n I was upset. I wasn\u0027t sitting next to Brandon to get back at Nash or to prove anything to him; I was doing it to show Brandon support. But Nash was striking back in a big way by inviting Heidi Rosen to sit in my seat at our table. I was stung with jealousy, not so much about Nash, but about my friends, as I headed out of the cafeteria and saw Heidi across from Ivy and Abby. Were my best friends going to replace me, too?\n I longed to sit next to Brandon, like yesterday when I got to have my leg and ankle touch his. Maybe if he was smooth enough, Brandon would grab my hand underneath the table. I imagined us all together, Ivy and Jake, Abby and Dylan, and me and Brandon. He would be a star to them, joining us at campfires on his hilltop, hiking, and skating on his frozen pond. And when he turned into were-form he\u0027d be the handsome and heroic member of our group. But was I open enough to have Nash bring along Heidi? We girls were a threesome, and I\u0027m not sure that I was ready for Ivy and Abby to have a new best friend.\n But though it would be awkward, I think I was ready - because I was in love with Brandon. And having Brandon included definitely trumped my jealousy for seeing my former boyfriend cozy with a hot girl.\n \"You want everyone to get along,\" Ivy said. \"But unfortunately that\u0027s not how the this town works. You have to sit with us tomorrow. You have to. Our friendship depends on it.\"\n But even I had my limits. \"I can\u0027t. Not with Heidi, too.\"\n I took my lunch and exited the cafeteria, not passing Brandon along the way. I found an empty alcove on the lower level and sat down. I wasn\u0027t even in the mood to eat, but I did feel a sense of relief having a peaceful moment to myself. I took out a book and began to escape into its pages.\n With the full moon approaching and Brandon\u0027s impending transformation coming, I wasn\u0027t sure what other changes were going to happen as well. Would I continue to sit alone and be pushed out of the clique I\u0027d been part of for so many years? Would Brandon be bullied now more than ever because I showed him my support? And would others besides Nash find out that Brandon was the one howling in the full moonlight?\n It was too much for me to grapple with alone during a single lunch period. And for the first time at Legend\u0027s Run High, I wanted to spend time by myself. Ivy was correct. Things were changing. And one of those things was me. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/magic-of-the-moonlight-full-moon-2/page-6.html","bookId":2149,"book":{"id":2149,"title":"Magic of the Moonlight (Full Moon #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Magic of the Moonlight (Full Moon #2) \n Beware of a bite under a full moon… \n it will complicate your love life. \n Celeste has more to worry about than a secret romance with a hot guy from the wrong side of town.
