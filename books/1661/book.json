Pulsing with romance and danger, Brooke will leave readers desperate for the conclusion to this epic and unforgettable saga. \n The only fight she can\u0027t win is the one for Perry\u0027s heart. Following the stunning climax in Through the Ever Night, the Tides have been forced to seek shelter from the Aether storms in a dismal, secluded cave. But Brooke\u0027s memories of the cave go back much further, to when she and Perry used to come here together. That was before Perry fell in love with Aria and before Vale\u0027s dealings with the Dwellers altered the course of the Tides forever. \n Now, with her sister back from a haunting year in captivity and Aria lying unconscious in the sick bay, Brooke struggles to put the pieces of her life back together. Without Perry, who is she? And what is her role in this frightening new world? As these questions swirl about her, an old threat to the Tides resurfaces, and Brooke is forced to put the lives of her people before her own. But in taking this step outside of herself, Brooke may finally discover what she truly wants.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/brooke-under-the-never-sky-0.jpg","author":"Veronica Rossi","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":10,"category":{"id":7,"name":"Science Fiction","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
