{"id":2622,"title":"Running with the Pack","description":"Storyline: Remember the werewolves of classic stories and films, those bloodthirsty monsters that transformed under the full moon, reminding us of the terrible nature that lives within all of us? Today\u0027s werewolves are much more suave - and even sexy - and they\u0027ve moved from British moors to New York City lofts, shaved, and got jobs. But as the tales of these writers will show you, they remain no less wild and passionate, and they still tug at the part of our being where a wild animal used to be. Running With the Pack includes stories from Carrie Vaughn, Laura Anne Gilman, and C.E. Murphy, and they will convince you that despite their gentrification, werewolves remain as fascinating and terrifying as ever.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/running-with-the-pack.jpg","author":"Ekaterina Sedia","type":"Horror","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","category":{"id":2,"name":"Horror","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
