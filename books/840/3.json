{"id":32827,"no":3,"title":"CHAPTER II","content":"THE SECRET OF THE STOLEN GAINSBOROUGH—AND THE LESSON OF THE CAREER OF RAYMOND, THE \"PRINCE OF SAFE BLOWERS,\" WHO BUILT A MILLIONAIRE\u0027S RESIDENCE IN A FASHIONABLE LONDON SUBURB AND KEPT A YACHT WITH A CREW OF 20 MEN IN THE MEDITERRANEAN It was on the morning of May 15, several years ago, that the manager of Agnew\u0027s great art gallery in London turned the key in the lock of the private gallery to show an art patron the famous \"Gainsborough.\" His amiable smile faded from his lips as he came face to face with an empty gilt frame. The great $125,000 painting had been cut from its frame. Who stole this masterpiece? How was it stolen? Could it be recovered? The best detectives of Europe and America were asked to find answers to these questions. They never did. I will answer them here for the first time to-day. The man who cut the Gainsborough from its frame was a millionaire, he was an associate of mine, he was a bank burglar. Adam Worth, or Harry Raymond, as he was known to his friends, did not need the money and he did not want the painting—he entered that London art gallery at 3 o\u0027clock in the morning and took that roll of canvas[Pg 38] out under his arm for a purpose that nobody suspected. I will explain all this presently. I have said that Raymond was a millionaire, and I said in previous chapters that crime does not pay—how is it possible to reconcile these two statements? We shall see. Among all my old acquaintances and associates in the criminal world, perhaps no one serves better as an example of the truth that crime does not pay than this very millionaire burglar, this man who had earned the title of the \"Prince of Safe Blowers.\" For a time he seemed to have everything his heart could desire—a mansion, servants, liveried equipages, a yacht; and it all crumbled away like a house of cards, vanished like the wealth of Aladdin in the Arabian Nights. And so Raymond, most \"successful\" bank robber of the day, lived to learn the lesson that crime does not pay. Raymond was a Massachusetts boy—bright, wide awake, but headstrong. Born of an excellent family and well educated, he formed bad habits and developed a passion for gambling. RAYMOND\u0027S FIRST CRIMES Unable to earn honestly all he needed to gratify his passion for gambling, Raymond soon drifted into the companionship of some professional thieves he had met in the army. From that time his downfall was rapid; he never earned another honest dollar. Like myself and many other criminals who[Pg 39] later achieved notoriety in broader fields, he first tried picking pockets. He had good teachers and he was an apt pupil. His long, slender fingers seemed just made for the delicate task of slipping watches out of men\u0027s pockets and purses out of women\u0027s handbags. Soon he had plenty of money and a wide reputation for his cleverness in escaping arrest. Aside from his love for faro and roulette, Raymond was always a prudent, thrifty man. In those early days he picked pockets so skillfully and disposed of his booty to the \"fences\" so shrewdly that it was not long before he had enough capital to finance other criminals. The first manifestation of the executive ability which was one day to make him a power in the underworld was his organization of a band of pickpockets. Raymond\u0027s word was law with the little group of young thieves he gathered around him. He furnished the brains to keep them out of trouble and the cash to get them out if by chance they got in. Every morning they met in a little Canal Street restaurant to take their orders from him—at night they came back to hand him a liberal share of the day\u0027s earnings. But even the enormous profits of this syndicate of pickpockets were not enough to satisfy Raymond\u0027s restless ambition. He began to cast envious eyes at men like my husband (Ned Lyons), Big Jim Brady, Dan Noble, Tom Bigelow, and other bank sneaks and burglars whom he met in the places where criminals gathered. These men were big,[Pg 40] strong, good-looking fellows. Their work looked easy—it was certainly exciting. They had long intervals of leisure and were always well supplied with money. \"If these men can make a good living robbing banks,\" thought Raymond, \"why can\u0027t I?\" It was through Raymond\u0027s itching to get into bank work that I first met him. One day he came into a restaurant where my husband and I were sitting, and Mr. Lyons introduced him to me. I myself saw little in him to impress me, but when he had gone my husband said: \"That fellow will be a great thief some day.\" AMBITIOUS TO BE A BANK BURGLAR It was hard for a young man to get a foothold with an organized party of bank robbers, for the more experienced men were reluctant to risk their chances of success by taking on a beginner. \"No doubt you\u0027re all right,\" they told him, \"but you can see yourself that we can\u0027t afford to have anybody around that hasn\u0027t had experience in our line of business. It\u0027s too risky for us, and it wouldn\u0027t be fair to you.\" \"But how am I going to get experience if some of you chaps don\u0027t give me a chance?\" Raymond replied; but still he got no encouragement from my husband and his companions. \"All right,\" he finally said one day. \"I\u0027ll show you what I can do—I won\u0027t be asking to be taken in with you; you will be asking me.\" [Pg 41] So Raymond, in order to get experience, cheerfully made up his mind to make his first attempt in that line alone. He broke into an express company\u0027s office on Liberty Street and forced open a safe containing $30,000 in gold. The inner box, however, in which the money was kept, proved too much for Raymond\u0027s limited experience. To his great disgust, daylight came before he was able to get it open. Tired and mad, Raymond trudged home in the gray of the morning, dusty, greasy, and with his tools under his arm. The newspapers printed the full details of the curious failure to reach the funds in the express company\u0027s safe, and Ned Lyons and his companions guessed very quickly whose work it was. Meeting Raymond a few days later, they accused him of having done the bungling job. He admitted that the joke was on him, and they all laughed loudly at his effort to get some experience. \"You\u0027re all right,\" said Big Jim Brady. \"You\u0027ve got the right idea—that\u0027s the only way to learn; keep at it and you will make a name for yourself some day.\" His next undertaking was more successful. From the safe of an insurance company in Cambridge, Mass., his native town, he took $20,000 in cash. This established him as a bank burglar, and he soon became associated with a gang of expert cracksmen, including Ike Marsh, Bob Cochran, and Charley Bullard. [Pg 42] ROBBING THE BOYLSTON BANK Raymond was very proud of having gotten a footing among the big bank burglars, whom he had long looked upon with respect and envy. After several minor robberies Raymond became uneasy, and declared that he wanted to do a really big job that would be worth while—something that would astonish the police and would merit the respect of the big professional bank burglars. ROBBING THE BOYLSTON BANK ROBBING THE BOYLSTON BANK Being a native of Massachusetts, he decided to give his attention to something in his own State. He made a tour of inspection of all the Boston banks, and decided that the famous Boylston Bank, the biggest in the city, would suit him. And, in picking this great bank, Raymond had[Pg 43] indeed selected an undertaking which was worthy of his skill and daring. On Washington Street Raymond\u0027s quick eye at once discovered a vacant shop adjoining the Boylston Bank. He rented this shop, ostensibly for a patent medicine laboratory, filled the windows with bottles of bitters and built a partition across the back of the shop. The partition was to hide the piles of débris which would accumulate as the robbers burrowed into the bank next door; the bottles in the window to prevent passersby seeing too much of the interior. When news of this clever ruse of Raymond\u0027s came out in the papers after the robbery, I made a note of it and used the same idea years later in robbing an Illinois bank at its president\u0027s request. That is an interesting chapter in my life which I will give you soon. Careful measurements had shown where the tunneling through the thick walls of the bank could best be bored. Work was done only at night, and in a week\u0027s time only a thin coating of plaster separated them from the treasure. The robbers entered the vault on Saturday night, broke open three safes which they found there and escaped with a million dollars in cash and securities. After this crime America was not safe for Raymond, so he and his comrades, including Charley Bullard, fled to Europe. In Paris Bullard opened a gambling house, and there Raymond lived when the criminal ventures[Pg 44] from which he was amassing his first fortune permitted. And now there entered into Raymond\u0027s life a very remarkable romance, which almost caused him to reform. In one of the big Parisian hotels at this time was an Irish barmaid named Kate Kelley. She was an unusually beautiful girl—a plump, dashing blonde of much the same type Lillian Russell was years ago. Bullard and Raymond both fell madly in love with her. The race for her favor was a close one, despite the fact that Bullard was an accomplished musician, spoke several languages fluently, and was in other ways Raymond\u0027s superior. The scales, however, were surely turning in Raymond\u0027s favor when the rumor that he was a bank robber reached Kate\u0027s ears. Raymond admitted this was the truth. But he never attempted to take advantage of his friend Bullard by telling Kate that he also was a thief. That was characteristic of the man. Criminal though he was, he never stooped to anything mean or underhanded, and would stand by his friends through thick and thin. Instead of trying to drag Bullard to disappointment with him, he pleaded with Kate to forgive his past and to help him make a fresh start. \"Marry me,\" he urged, \"and I\u0027ll never commit another crime. We\u0027ll go to some distant land and[Pg 45] I\u0027ll start all over again in some decent, honorable business.\" But Kate would not be persuaded. She could not marry a self-confessed thief—no, never! A month later she married Bullard, little dreaming how glad the American police would be to lay their hands on him. Raymond was best man at the wedding, and to his credit it should be said that the bridal couple had no sincerer well-wisher than he. RAYMOND\u0027S GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT Kate never realized how she had been deceived until several years later, when Bullard was given a prison sentence for running a crooked gambling house. She got an inkling of the facts then and her husband confessed the rest. By this time, however, she had two little children, and her anxiety for them impelled her to become reconciled to the situation and stick to her husband. After his release they left the children in a French school, returned to this country, and took a brown-stone house at the corner of Cumberland Street and De Kalb Avenue, in Brooklyn. Here they installed all the costly furniture, bric-à-brac, and paintings which had made Bullard\u0027s gambling house one of the show places of Paris. Soon afterward Raymond also came to America, although there was a price on his head for his share in the Boylston Bank robbery. He lived with Kate and Bullard until the latter\u0027s jealousy caused a[Pg 46] quarrel. Then he went to London and laid the foundations for the international clearing house of crime which for years had its headquarters in his luxurious apartment in Piccadilly. With Raymond\u0027s cool, calculating brain no longer there to guide him, Bullard became reckless and fell into the hands of the police. He was sentenced to twenty years in prison. For her own and her children\u0027s support his wife had nothing except the rich contents of the Brooklyn home. She tried various ways of making a living, with poor success, and was at last forced to offer a quantity of her paintings for sale in an art store on Twenty-third Street. In this store one day she met Antonio Terry. His father was an Irishman, his mother a native of Havana, and he had inherited millions of dollars in Cuban sugar plantations. Young Terry was infatuated with Kate\u0027s queenly beauty, and he laid siege to her heart so ardently that she divorced her convict husband and married him. Two children blessed this exceedingly happy marriage. Before Terry died he divided his fortune equally among his wife, his own children, and the children she had by her first husband. Kate Terry lived until 1895, and left an estate valued at $6,000,000. She passed her last years in a magnificent mansion on Fifth Avenue, surrounded by every luxury. Kate Kelley\u0027s refusal to marry Raymond was one of the great disappointments of his unhappy life. He married another woman, but I am sure he never forgot the winsome Irish barmaid who[Pg 47] had won his heart in Paris. \"What\u0027s the news of Kate?\" used to be his first question whenever I arrived in London, and his face would fall if something prevented my seeing her on my last visit to New York. Had this woman become Raymond\u0027s wife I am confident that the whole course of his life would have been changed, and that the world would have something to remember him for besides an unbroken record of crime. PLANNING THE GAINSBOROUGH ROBBERY As I have said, Raymond had not been long in London before he had forced his way into a commanding position in the criminal world. The cleverest thieves of every nation sought him out as soon as they set foot in England. They sought his advice, carried out his orders, and gladly shared with him the profits of their illegal enterprises. Crimes in every corner of the globe were planned in his luxurious home—and there, often, the final division of booty was made. No crime seemed too difficult or too daring for Raymond to undertake. It was his almost unbroken record of success in getting large amounts of plunder and in escaping punishment for crimes that gave the underworld such confidence in him and made all the cleverest criminals his accomplices. Another reason for his leadership was his unwavering loyalty to his friends. Raymond never \"squealed\"—he never deserted a friend. When[Pg 48] one of his associates ran foul of the law he would give as freely of his brains and money to secure his release as if his own liberty were at stake. It was his loyalty to a friend—a thief named Tom Warren—which led to his bold theft of the famous Gainsborough portrait for which J. Pierpont Morgan later paid $125,000. Here is how it came about: Warren was in jail in London for his share in one of Raymond\u0027s forgeries. He was a great favorite of Raymond\u0027s and Harry vowed he would have him out before his case ever came to trial. This, however, was no easy matter, because England is not like this country, where almost anyone can furnish bond. The bondsman in England must be a freeholder and of good reputation. While Raymond was searching his fertile brain for some way out of the difficulty, he and an English thief named Jack Philips happened to be walking through Bond Street and noticed the large number of fashionable carriages stopping at Agnew \u0026 Company\u0027s art gallery. To satisfy their curiosity they entered the gallery and found that everybody was crowding about a wonderful portrait of the Duchess of Devonshire, painted by the master hand of the great artist Gainsborough. It was Gainsborough\u0027s masterpiece, and the Agnews were considering a number of bids that had been made for the painting. They had one offer of $100,000 from an American, but they were holding it on exhibition in the belief that a still better bid would be made. [Pg 49] Raymond stood long and thoughtfully on the edge of the crowd, studied the painting, took in the doors, walls, windows, chatted with an attendant, and slowly sauntered out, swinging his cane. \"I have the idea,\" exclaimed Raymond the instant they were in the street again. \"We\u0027ll steal that picture and use it as a club to compel the Agnews to go bail for Tom Warren.\" \"You don\u0027t want that picture,\" said Philips. \"It\u0027s a clumsy thing to do anything with.\" \"Of course I don\u0027t want the picture—but Agnew does,\" Raymond replied. \"If I get it and send word that Tom Warren, who is in jail, knows where it\u0027s hidden—don\u0027t you suppose Agnew will hurry down to Old Bailey Prison, bail poor Tom out mighty quick, and pay him something besides if Warren digs up the picture for him?\" \"He might,\" admitted Philips. \"Why, of course he will,\" persisted Raymond. \"And it\u0027s the only way I can see to make sure of getting Tom Warren out before he is called for trial. When they try him they\u0027ll convict him; and then it\u0027s too late.\" Philips was not enthusiastic over the scheme. In the first place he thought it too risky. Even if they did succeed in getting the picture he feared it would prove an elephant on their hands. Raymond, however, was a man who seldom receded from a decision, no matter how quickly it had been made. He argued away Philip\u0027s objections and with the assistance of Joe Elliott, a forger whom they took into[Pg 50] their confidence, they proceeded with their plans for the robbery. HOW THE GREAT MASTERPIECE WAS STOLEN It was decided to make the attempt on the first dark, foggy night. Elliott was to be the \"lookout\" and keep a watchful eye for any of the army of policemen and private detectives who guarded the gallery\u0027s treasures. Philips was to serve as the \"stepladder.\" On his broad, powerful shoulders, the light, agile Raymond would mount like a circus performer, climb through a window and cut the precious canvas out of the frame. It was a job fraught with the greatest danger, for the gallery was carefully protected with locks and bars and, besides, no one could tell when a policeman or detective might appear on the scene. A thick fog settled down on the city the night of May 15, 1876. Under its cover the thieves decided to make their descent on the gallery early the next morning. Just as the clocks were striking three, Raymond stole cautiously into the alley at the rear of the Agnew gallery. Then he was joined after a judicious interval by his two comrades. Elliott remained near the mouth of the alley to watch for \"bobbies.\" Raymond and Philips stealthily made their way over the back fence and to a rear window, whose sill was about eight feet from the ground. [Pg 51] Straining his ears for any ominous sound, Philips braced his big body to bear Raymond\u0027s weight. Then he made a stirrup of his hand and Raymond sprang like a cat to his shoulders. Crouching in the darkness, Elliott watched and waited while Raymond applied his jimmy to the window. \"Click\" went the fastenings—but not too loud. The sash was cautiously raised and Harry Raymond dropped to the floor inside. Unluckily for the owners of the Gainsborough, the watchmen were asleep on an upper floor. Raymond, with the clever thief\u0027s characteristic caution, first groped his way to the front door to see if he could unfasten it and thus provide a second avenue of escape for use in an emergency. But the locks and bars were too much for him and he gave up the attempt. By the dim rays of his dark lantern he could see the gallery\u0027s pride—the famous Gainsborough, hanging on what picture dealers know as \"the line\"—that is to say, about five feet from the floor. The place was as quiet as the grave. A sudden sound gave Raymond a start—but it was only a cat that came mewing out of the darkness. Outside a cab rattled by and the heavy tread of a policeman\u0027s feet echoed through the street. Raymond procured a table, which he placed before the portrait. By standing upon it he was barely able to reach the top. With a long, sharp knife he carefully slashed the precious canvas from its heavy gold frame. [Pg 52] At one of the bottom corners Raymond\u0027s knife made a series of peculiar zigzags. Later he cut from the portrait a little piece that matched these jagged lines. This was to send to the Agnews as evidence that he really had the picture. HOW RAYMOND CUT THE FAMOUS GAINSBOROUGH OUT OF ITS FRAME HOW RAYMOND CUT THE FAMOUS \"GAINSBOROUGH\" OUT OF ITS FRAME. After cutting the picture out, Raymond rolled it up carefully, tied it with a string, and buttoned it underneath his coat. Then he went out the same way he had entered, being careful to close the window behind him. With his companions he returned to his Piccadilly house and hid in a closet the picture which he hoped would prove his friend\u0027s ransom. Next morning all London was in a fever of excitement over the loss of the Gainsborough. The Agnews offered $5,000 for its return and soon increased the reward to $15,000. A hundred of the best detectives in Scotland Yard scoured the city for clews. The crime was shrouded in mystery. The doors of the gallery had not been tampered with. The fastenings of a rear window were broken, but the watchmen averred that no thief could have entered there as they had been sitting close by all night. In all London the only persons who had no theories to advance as to the Gainsborough\u0027s fate were Raymond, Philips, and Elliott. They quietly waited for the excitement to subside, realizing that with the public mind in its present state it was altogether too hazardous to think of attempting to negotiate for the picture\u0027s return. Meanwhile something happened to make the Gainsborough of no use to Raymond—his friend[Pg 53] Warren was released from jail through the discovery of a technicality in his indictment. The famous portrait now became a veritable \"white elephant.\" Raymond dared not return it—he feared to leave it in storage lest some one recognize it. So he carried the roll of canvas with him about the world until later, when, through \"Pat\" Sheedy\u0027s aid, he returned it to the Agnews and secured $25,000 for his pains. PAT SHEEDY\u0027S PART And that is the history of what happened to Gainsborough\u0027s famous \"Duchess of Devonshire\" painting, which is now in J. Pierpont Morgan\u0027s private art gallery on Madison Avenue, New York. As I said earlier in this article, Raymond, who stole it, neither wanted the picture nor the money it represented. Raymond cut that painting from its frame as an act of loyalty to a fellow thief who was in trouble—to use it as a powerful lever to make sure of getting Tom Warren out of prison. And right here, before going further with the episodes of Raymond\u0027s remarkable career, let me explain the mystery of how \"Pat\" Sheedy, the New York gambler, happened to be the person who sold the stolen Gainsborough back to the Agnews. Long before that \"Pat\" Sheedy and Harry Raymond had done much business together. After Sheedy had accumulated a fortune by gambling, he built up a large and exceedingly profitable business[Pg 54] in the sale of stolen paintings. Through his wide acquaintance he formed a convenient connecting link between the rich men who could afford to buy rare paintings and the clever criminals who knew how to steal them. Raymond took up the stealing of paintings when he became too old and too well known to the police to attempt more profitable kinds of robbery, and it was through Sheedy that he disposed of most of them. A number of years before Raymond died he met me in London and asked if I could do some business for him. Being in need of ready money, I readily agreed. He took me to his apartments and handed me two paintings which showed at a glance that they had been cut from their frames. \"I got these from a cathedral in Antwerp,\" said Raymond. \"I want you to take them to New York and sell them to Pat Sheedy for $75,000. If he won\u0027t give that, bring them back to me. I\u0027ll pay you well for your time and trouble.\" Accordingly I sailed for New York. By wrapping the pictures in some old clothes at the bottom of my trunk, I got them by the customs inspectors without any trouble. I had then never met Sheedy and it occurred to me that if I had to leave the pictures with him he might try to take advantage of my ignorance of art by substituting copies for the originals. So, before setting out for Sheedy\u0027s office in Forty-second Street, I took an indelible pencil and marked my initials, very small, on the back of each canvas. [Pg 55] As I had expected, Sheedy asked me to leave the pictures until the next day as he was not sure he could afford to pay $75,000 for them. The next day he put me off with some other excuse, and so it went on for two weeks until I felt sure something was wrong. Then one morning he handed me two pictures, saying: \"Sorry, but I don\u0027t think these are worth more than $10,000. If you\u0027ll take that for them, I\u0027ll buy them.\" RAYMOND AND HIS YACHT Of course, I told him my instructions were not to accept a cent less than $75,000, and if he didn\u0027t want to pay that I would have to take them back to London. I was about to roll them up when I chanced to think of looking for my initials. They were not there—Sheedy was trying to palm off cheap copies on me in place of the originals. Quick as a flash, I pulled out the revolver I always carried in those days; shoved it right under Sheedy\u0027s nose, and said: \"Come, Mr. Sheedy—hand over the original paintings I left with you, or I\u0027ll blow your head off!\" He was considerably amazed at this warlike nerve on my part, but still had nerve enough left to argue that those were the pictures I had given him. But I was not to be tricked like that. Finally he went into an adjoining room—I after him with the gun in my hand—pulled open a drawer and took out the canvasses which had my initials on the back.[Pg 56] I carried them back to London, where Raymond sold them for $75,000, of which he gave me $10,000. I sold many stolen paintings to Sheedy after that, but he never tried to take advantage of me again. Raymond often used to tell me that all his bad luck dated from the night he stole the famous Gainsborough. If the portrait really was a \"hoodoo\" its evil influence was a long time in taking effect. The two or three years after his robbery of the Agnew gallery saw the most daring crimes of his life and the money they yielded made him a multi-millionaire. Even his heavy losses at Monte Carlo could not seriously affect a fortune which was being steadily increased by all sorts of illegal undertakings. He lived like a prince in London and Paris, owned several race horses and maintained, besides a sailing yacht, a palatial steam yacht with a crew of twenty men. He liked to vary the monotony of his cruises by deeds of piracy as sensational as any Captain Kidd ever attempted. On one such occasion he robbed a post-office on the island of Malta; on another he attempted to loot a warehouse on the docks at Kingston, Jamaica. This last exploit would have ended in his capture by a British gunboat which pursued him for twenty miles had his yacht not been a remarkably speedy craft. RAYMOND\u0027S EXPERT ON SAFE CRACKING Raymond was a natural leader of men, and he had a sharp eye for able assistants. In his gangs[Pg 57] were the greatest experts he could collect around him. Raymond was not a technically educated machinist, and he felt the need of an expert mechanic. For a number of years he watched the work of various other bank burglars and gave especial attention to any work that showed peculiar mechanical skill in getting into locks and steel safes. Finally Raymond got his eye on a very promising young burglar named Mark Shinburn, who turned out to be a perfect wonder as a safe opener. Shinburn had served an apprenticeship in a machine shop and soon got a job in the factory of the Lilly Safe Company. Locks and safes had a peculiar fascination for Shinburn and he rapidly mastered the whole scheme, theory, and practice of lock-making, and knew the weak points not only of the locks his own company made but also of all the other big safe makers whose locks and safes were on the market. Shinburn was just the man to fit into Raymond\u0027s band of experts. He had the peculiar and valuable technical knowledge that Raymond lacked. Raymond would select a bank, study the habits of the bank clerks, survey the situation, and lay out the plans for the job. Raymond would execute all these preliminaries and would lead his men into the bank and face to face with the safe; but at this point Shinburn would bring his genius into action and Raymond would stand by holding his dark lantern and watching Shinburn with silent admiration. Raymond and Shinburn were the moving spirits[Pg 58] of the bold gang which robbed the Ocean Bank in New York of a million dollars. With them were associated Jimmy Hope, who later led the attack on the Manhattan Bank; my husband, Ned Lyons, George Bliss, and several others. On his return from a series of bank robberies on the Continent, Raymond took apartments in the house of a widow who lived with her two daughters in Bayswater, a suburb of London. He became in time much attached to this woman and her children, and lavished every luxury on them, including the education of the girls in the best French schools. For years this family never suspected their benefactor was a criminal, but supposed him to be a prosperous diamond importer. When the eldest daughter\u0027s education was finished Raymond married her. She was a beautiful woman, but a weak, clinging sort of creature—very different from strong, self-willed Kate Kelley. Although passionately fond of her, Raymond\u0027s attitude toward her was always that of the devoted father rather than the loving husband. After his marriage Raymond made many sincere attempts to reform. He became a student of art and literature, and for months at a time would live quietly in his London home or on board his yacht. Then the old life would call him—he would mysteriously drop out of sight for a few weeks, and with the aid of some of his old associates add another crime to his record. On one of these occasions he and John Curtin, a[Pg 59] desperate burglar, went to Liège, Belgium. Their object was the robbery of a wagon which carried a large amount of valuable registered mail. Raymond had fitted a key to the lock on the wagon and had sent a decoy package, whose delivery would necessitate the driver leaving the mail unguarded at a certain place. Curtin was to delay the driver\u0027s return while Raymond climbed up on the front of the wagon and rifled the pouches. TREACHERY AND TRAGEDY But Curtin carelessly failed to carry out part of this arrangement and the driver caught Raymond in the act. He was arrested, convicted, and given the first and only prison sentence he ever received—eight years at hard labor. With the loyalty for which he was famous Raymond steadfastly refused to reveal the identity of the confederate to whose folly he owed his own arrest, and Curtin escaped to England. Soon after his sentence began, rumors reached Raymond in prison of the undue intimacy of his wife and Curtin. He investigated the reports and found them true. Raging with indignation at his wife\u0027s weakness and his friend\u0027s treachery, he broke his lifelong habit of loyalty, confessed to the authorities Curtin\u0027s share in the attempted robbery and told them where he could be found. Curtin was brought back to Belgium and sentenced to five years in prison. [Pg 60] Mrs. Raymond\u0027s mind gave way under its weight of remorse, and soon after her husband\u0027s release she died in an asylum. This was not the only crushing misfortune the released convict had to face. Through unfortunate investments and the dishonesty of friends he had trusted, his fortune had dwindled to almost nothing. He had to sell his yachts, his horses, and his London house with its fine library and art galleries in order to raise enough to provide for the education of his three children. He sent them to America, where they grew to manhood and womanhood in ignorance of the truth about their father. With an energy worthy of a better cause, Raymond at once set about making a new fortune. The whole world was his field-forgeries, bank robberies, and jewel thefts his favorite methods. But the nervous strain under which he had always lived and the long prison term were beginning to tell on him. His health was poor—his hand and brain were losing much of their cunning. Each crime made the next one more difficult, as the police got to know him and his methods better, and at last he was forced to abandon the bolder forms of robbery and devote his time entirely to the theft of famous paintings. Yet, in the face of these handicaps, Raymond made in those last years of his life several fortunes. But one after another they were all swept away as quickly as they were made, and he died, as I have said, penniless. [Pg 61] Did crime pay Harry Raymond? He invested his natural endowment of brains, resourcefulness, daring, energy, and perseverance in criminal enterprises—and died a hunted, hungry, trembling outcast. One-half his industry and intelligence expended in honest business would have insured him a great and enduring fortune and a respected name.
