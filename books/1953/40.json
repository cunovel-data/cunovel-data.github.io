Who would’ve believed it?” “Oh, Grace, she’s just perfect for him.” Grace settled back and giggled like a schoolgirl. “She doesn’t let him get away with anything,” Olivia went on. “She sees right through him and calls his bluff. I don’t think a woman’s ever spoken to him the way Miranda does. Including his wife… In the beginning, I thought Will would lose it. I’m pretty sure he fired her at least once, and I know for a fact that she walked out on him one day.” “That must really have set him off.” “It did.” “But it wasn’t long before Will realized what an asset she is, so he had to humble himself and ask her to return.” “Will? Humble? Those are two words that don’t mix.” “No, they don’t, which is why Mom and I think the world of Miranda.” Oh, Miranda was going to be so good for Will. Because he was attractive and successful and sophisticated, Olivia’s brother took pride in getting women to fall for him. His ego seemed to need it. She also wondered if he was one of those people who loved being in love, who was addicted to the excitement and unpredictability, the chase and the challenge. She’d actually fallen for him herself after her first husband’s death. Will had almost ruined her subsequent relationship with Cliff. Fortunately, she’d broken off with Will, which he’d made even more difficult by insisting he loved her. In retrospect Grace saw that he hadn’t really loved her at all. Yes, he was fond of her but what he really enjoyed was being in control. Miranda wouldn’t be so easily manipulated and that would frustrate Will no end. But it was the best thing that could’ve happened to him. “I do have to say Will’s attitude has changed since he came back to Cedar Cove. That’s been a surprise,” Olivia said. “Oh?” “You know better than anyone that my brother and I have had our differences over the years. I disapproved of some of the things he’s done, but it’s his life.” Olivia raised one shoulder in a shrug. “I didn’t know if I could trust him after he moved back here.” Grace knew exactly what her friend meant… . “But he’s made an effort to get involved in the community. And I can’t tell you how grateful I am that I don’t need to deal with everything concerning Mom by myself.” Grace agreed. “He’s been wonderful with your mother and Ben.” “I’ve come to appreciate my brother.” “I’m glad.” Goldie returned to their table with a coffeepot in one hand and a pot of hot water in the other. “You two ready for a refill?” she asked. Grace looked at her friend. “None for me. What about you?” Olivia shook her head. “I’m pretty full, too.” Glancing down at the half-consumed slice of pie, Goldie asked, “You want me to wrap that up for you?” “No, thanks.” Goldie gave a disgusted snort. “Okay, well, see you girls next week.” Next week. Same time. Same place. Grace would meet with Olivia, who’d always been with her. Who shared her burdens and doubled her joys. Her friend for life. Thirty-One Linc stepped into his office and smiled at the stack of work orders on his desk. Sheriff Troy Davis had helped him immeasurably by sending business his way. The sheriff was active in a number of service organizations, such as Rotary Club and Lions, where he’d made a point of spreading the word. At first, business had trickled in slowly, but as the weeks progressed, the auto body shop drew more and more work. As it stood now, Linc had all his employees working a forty-hour week. The business wasn’t the only thing going well in Linc’s life. He was delighted with the duplex and his growing friendship with Mack. Most of all, he deeply loved Lori and looked forward to every minute he spent with her. If he’d known marriage could be this satisfying, he would’ve tried it a lot sooner, he’d joked to Lori. Laughing, she’d informed him that he never would’ve found anyone who suited him nearly as well—and she was right. Thinking about Lori, he felt a twinge of sadness as he thought about the situation with her family. The conflict between him and his father-in-law remained unresolved. The fact that Leonard and Kate had separated over Leonard’s reaction to their daughter’s marriage was an additional burden. Lori was in close contact with her mother once again. They talked nearly every day, but although Kate put a good face on it, Linc could tell how hurt and disappointed she was that Leonard had made no effort to get in touch with her. Sitting down at his desk, Linc reached for the telephone directory and flipped through the pages. He quickly located the listing for Bellamy Enterprises in Bremerton. A woman answered in a crisp professional voice. “How may I direct your call?” “I’d like to speak to Leonard Bellamy’s assistant,” he responded in the same businesslike tones. “One moment, please.” “This is Helen,” another woman said an instant later. Linc drew in a breath. “Helen, this is Lincoln Wyse.” He paused, waiting for a reaction. When none came, he continued. “Would it be possible to schedule an appointment with Mr. Bellamy?” “Let me check his schedule.” Linc was put on hold for several minutes before the woman came back. “Mr. Bellamy said he’s available in half an hour.” “Mr. Bellamy,” Linc murmured. He hadn’t counted on the assistant speaking directly with her employer. Glancing at his watch, he asked, “Four?” “Yes, four.” “I’ll be there.” It was already three-thirty. Linc realized that if he didn’t leave right away, he’d be late. No doubt Bellamy would add that to his list of crimes. Linc washed up, then drove the entire distance above the speed limit, risking a ticket. He found a convenient parking spot, then ran to the downtown office complex. He’d only been here once before, and an unpleasant scene between him and Bellamy had resulted. Linc hadn’t had enough time to consider what he wanted to say to Bellamy. All he could do was be as forthright and honest as possible. He dashed up the steps to the building and caught an open elevator. Getting off on the top-floor lobby, he checked his watch and heaved a sigh of relief. Right on schedule. A middle-aged woman sitting at the front desk glanced up as he approached. She had short salt-and-pepper hair and looked every inch the professional assistant she was. Her nameplate identified her as Ms. Helen McDonald. “Lincoln Wyse,” he said. “I’ll let Mr. Bellamy know you’re here.” Helen picked up her phone and curtly announced his name. When she’d finished, she gestured toward a chair. “Please have a seat.” Linc did. Five minutes passed and then ten. So this was the game his father-in-law had chosen to play. Apparently Bellamy assumed Linc would lose patience and walk out. The fact was, Linc could be just as obstinate, just as unyielding. They had more in common than Leonard Bellamy realized. A full hour went by before the phone buzzed. Helen answered and nodded in Linc’s direction. “Mr. Bellamy will see you now.” Linc stood. “Thank you.” She led him to the private office and opened the door. Linc walked inside, gazing at the bookcases, the upholstered guest chairs, the desk of dark polished wood. Bellamy sat there, head bowed as he wrote. He didn’t acknowledge Linc or give any indication that he knew Linc had entered the room. Linc waited in front of the desk. He occupied himself by examining the family photographs, which stood in a row on the credenza behind his father-in-law. “I’m surprised you’re still here,” Bellamy said, not bothering to look up. He set down his pen and leaned back, a frown creasing his brow. Linc wished now that he’d taken the time to go home and change out of his work clothes, although he hadn’t had the opportunity. Getting here by four meant jumping right in his truck. No doubt if he’d been a minute late, Bellamy would have refused to see him. Score one point for his father-in-law, making Linc cool his heels like that, and another for catching him in greasy coveralls. “So,” Bellamy said. “What do you have to say for yourself?” “What do you want to hear?” “You’re the one who asked for the appointment, not me,” Bellamy muttered. “Yes, I did.” Linc tried to corral his thoughts. “Mostly I came because I need to know what you find so objectionable about me being married to your daughter.” Bellamy laughed. “The fact that you have to ask tells me everything.” “Maybe I could understand it if I hadn’t learned about your own background,” Linc said. He sat down and crossed his legs, hoping to create the impression of being at ease. “What do you mean?” Bellamy asked sharply. “I have no idea why you took such an instant dislike to me. I’ll admit the circumstances leading up to Lori’s and my wedding left a lot to be desired. We were foolish to rush into marriage… .” “Foolish doesn’t even begin to describe what you did.” “If I could, I’d go back and meet both you and your wife and ask your blessing before I married Lori.” “I’d never have given it.” Bellamy seemed to take grim pleasure in informing him of that. “Possibly not, but I hope you will now.” Bellamy glared at him across the desk. “Are you out of your mind? What would ever make you think I’d give you and Lori my blessing? Especially now that Kate—” He stopped abruptly, his lips pinched, as though he regretted mentioning his wife’s name. “I hope I’ve proved myself to you,” Linc said. “You threw a number of roadblocks in my way when I tried to establish my business in Cedar Cove.” He took a deep breath. “Nevertheless I’m making a go of it.” Bellamy didn’t deny it, which only went to show what Linc already knew. His father-in-law had done everything he could to sabotage his auto body shop and had nearly succeeded. If not for his brother-in-law and Sheriff Davis, Bellamy would have succeeded. “What puzzles me most is why you object to me when the two of us are so much alike.” “I sincerely doubt it,” Bellamy snapped. “From what I gather, your own father worked as a welder.” Bellamy stiffened. “That means nothing.” “It means you came from a family with a strong work ethic, which is the same ethic my father taught me. As it happens, I followed in my father’s footsteps. I might have chosen my own path, but that option was taken away from me when both my parents were killed and—” “And you saw a faster way of getting what you wanted by marrying my daughter,” Bellamy interrupted. Linc inhaled slowly in an effort to hold on to his temper. “You might find this hard to believe, but when I married Lori I didn’t have a clue that she was from a wealthy family.”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/1105-yakima-street-cedar-cove-11/page-40.html","bookId":1953,"book":{"id":1953,"title":"1105 Yakima Street (Cedar Cove #11)","description":"Storyline: 1105 Yakima Street (Cedar Cove #11) 1105 Yakima Street Cedar Cove, Washington Dear Reader, You’ve probably heard that my wife has left me.
