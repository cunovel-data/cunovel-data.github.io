{"id":68731,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"His announcement was followed by a stunned silence. “Rachel quit?”\\n\\n “Apparently,” Bruce said, hardly able to fathom it. Rachel had worked at the salon for ten years. It was a second home; her clients were her friends, and the other staff members were like family.\\n\\n Her leaving shocked him. She must’ve been desperate to get away and the reason, the only reason he could figure, was directly related to him and Jolene. In his eagerness to convince her to come home, he’d sent her fleeing.\\n\\n “Where’d she go?”\\n\\n If Bruce had any inkling, this news wouldn’t be nearly as devastating. “I don’t have a clue.”\\n\\n “Jane wouldn’t tell you?”\\n\\n He shook his head. “Either she genuinely doesn’t know or she isn’t willing to divulge the information.”\\n\\n “Really?” Jolene’s eyes widened.\\n\\n “I can’t believe Rachel would quit without telling me.” The fact that she’d left her job was one thing, but not mentioning it to him felt like…like a betrayal. He was afraid he’d lost Rachel entirely and that she never intended to return to their family. He refused to think that was the case.\\n\\n “I told you she’s a witch,” Jolene said calmly. She stood and carried the bowls of salsa and sour cream to the kitchen counter. “If Rachel’s decided she wants out of our lives, then I say we should let her go.” She hummed softly to herself, evidently happy with this turn of events.\\n\\n Bruce stood so quickly that his chair scraped against the hardwood floor. “How can you say that?”\\n\\n She spun around to face him. “What?”\\n\\n “That we should let Rachel go. She’s my wife.”\\n\\n “You’re going to divorce her, aren’t you?”\\n\\n Divorce her? How could Jolene even suggest it? “No!” He nearly shouted the word.\\n\\n “But we don’t need her. I can do the cooking and laundry and cleaning. I made dinner all by myself, didn’t I? It’s way better when it’s just the two of us like before you married her.”\\n\\n Bruce was horrified that his daughter could be so callous. “What about the baby?”\\n\\n “Well…” Jolene shrugged. “The baby’s a small complication, I agree.”\\n\\n “A small complication? A small complication,” he repeated. He couldn’t get the words out fast enough. “This small complication is my son or daughter, your brother or sister.”\\n\\n “I know that.”\\n\\n “In case you haven’t noticed, I miss Rachel. I want nothing more than to have her back. It’s wonderful that you can make a great taco dinner—don’t think I’m unappreciative. But Rachel means more to me than cooking dinner and doing the laundry. She’s my wife, my best friend, and I’m miserable without her.” He found it unimaginable that his daughter could be so self-centered, that all she thought about were her own interests and desires. She saw this pregnancy as a complication, while he was worried sick about his wife and child.\\n\\n He sagged back into his chair. “I called Teri Polgar and she doesn’t know where Rachel’s living, either.”\\n\\n “Rachel doesn’t want anyone to know. Not you, not her friends. We should just accept that,” Jolene said earnestly.\\n\\n Bruce looked up. “Have you heard anything I said?”\\n\\n “Yes, but I don’t agree. Dad, Rachel wants to get away from us.”\\n\\n Bruce didn’t believe that.\\n\\n “You say you love her and everything, but if she wants to live somewhere else, that’s up to her, isn’t it?”\\n\\n Jolene seemed to delight in pointing out that Rachel had left of her own free will. That she was the one who’d chosen to keep her whereabouts a secret.\\n\\n “Sit down, okay?” Bruce spoke soothingly, gesturing toward the chair.\\n\\n Sighing, Jolene reclaimed her seat. “What?” she said, folding her arms defiantly.\\n\\n “Do you remember, after your mother died, how you tried to hold on to your memories of her?” he asked gently.\\n\\n Jolene nodded.\\n\\n “Every night when I put you to bed you’d ask me questions about her.”\\n\\n “I liked listening to your stories about Mom,” she said. “Sometimes when you talked about her, your voice would go all soft and I could really, really see how much you loved her.”\\n\\n “I did love your mother. I still do and I always will. After we lost her, I didn’t think I could ever love another woman as much as I loved Stephanie. Then I—”\\n\\n “But Rachel ruined everything!”\\n\\n “No, Jolene. You didn’t let me finish. Then I discovered that loving again was possible—with Rachel. I want my wife back and I want us all to be a family.” Foolishly he’d hoped his daughter would see how sad Rachel’s departure had made him.\\n\\n “Daddy, you and I are a family. Rachel isn’t one of us.”\\n\\n “Yes, she is,” he told her. “I realize I made a mistake by rushing into this marriage. Rachel and I knew each other for a long time and we were friends before we fell in love. Once we did, we decided to get married, and I felt there was no reason to wait.”\\n\\n Jolene shook her head impatiently but Bruce paid no attention. He had something important to say and he was determined to make her listen.\\n\\n “What I failed to take into consideration was how you’d feel. For that I’m truly sorry. But it’s too late to go back. Rachel and I are husband and wife, and we’re going to have a baby.”\\n\\n With her arms still folded and a look of defiance, Jolene muttered, “Don’t remind me.”\\n\\n “I am reminding you because we have to work this out. Rachel suggested counseling but you refused.”\\n\\n Jolene shook her head again. “That’s so lame. No way am I talking to someone I don’t know.”\\n\\n “Not even if it helps you understand why you feel so negative about Rachel and our marriage?”\\n\\n “It wouldn’t make any difference,” she said angrily. “That’s how I feel.”\\n\\n “Please, Jolene.”\\n\\n “I said I won’t go and I won’t. You can’t force me to talk to anyone. If you think it’s so awful without Rachel, then you go.”\\n\\n He’d already scheduled his first appointment. “I plan to, but it would mean a lot to me if you’d attend the sessions, too.”\\n\\n “No way.” Her mouth thinned in patent disgust.\\n\\n “Why is it so hard for you to see that I’m concerned about Rachel and the baby? If Rachel’s completely on her own, what does the future hold for her and our child?”\\n\\n Jolene remained stubbornly quiet.\\n\\n “I remember a time when you begged me for a brother or sister,” he said.\\n\\n “I was only eight and I wasn’t smart enough to know that if I had a brother or sister I’d have a witch for a stepmother, too.”\\n\\n “Rachel isn’t a witch.” He swore if she referred to his wife like that one more time, he was going to lose it.\\n\\n “Sure, she isn’t one to you. The two of you were so lovey-dovey you couldn’t see what she’s really like.”\\n\\n “What did Rachel do that was so terrible other than marry me?” Unable to stay seated any longer he stood and circled the table, pushing back his hair in frustration. He could imagine how difficult it must’ve been for Rachel to deal with Jolene. She’d tried everything and, idiot that he was, Bruce hadn’t appreciated the self-control it took to put up with his daughter’s barbs and insults.\\n\\n No wonder Rachel had left. Bruce was as much to blame as his daughter. He’d been blind—willfully blind—and oblivious; now he was paying the price. If only he could turn back the clock…\\n\\n “Dad, be reasonable.”\\n\\n “Me?” he cried. “I’m unreasonable?”\\n\\n “Rachel will tell you when the baby’s born. You know she will.”\\n\\n “I want to be more involved in my child’s birth than just getting a phone call after the event. My place is with Rachel at the hospital, the way I was there with your mother. My child deserves that and I will not—” He pointed his finger at Jolene. He needed a moment to subdue his irritation before he could continue. “I will not let you dictate to me how I should feel about my son or daughter. It’s time you grew up and thought of someone other than yourself.”\\n\\n “Me?” Jolene leaped out of her chair, her face reddening. “Me?” she repeated. “The two of you were disgusting, going to bed so early every night. I knew what you were doing. It’s repulsive. And then you had to go and do something stupid like not use birth control!”\\n\\n “You need to snap out of this and accept that Rachel and I belong together.” Bruce was shouting now. His voice shook with the effort to control his anger. “This baby, boy or girl, is going to need a father who’s present and available in his or her life, just like I was for you.”\\n\\n Jolene wouldn’t look at him.\\n\\n “And he or she is going to need a big sister, too. You’ve said you see our child as a complication, but this is a sweet, innocent baby who’ll love you unconditionally…who’ll need your love, too. Are you so biased you can’t see that?” he asked. “Are you so coldhearted that you’d reject your own brother or sister because you’re jealous of Rachel?”\\n\\n “I am not jealous of Rachel!” Jolene screamed, tears streaming down her face. “I hate her! I hate you!”\\n\\n “So you hate your brother or sister, too,” he said calmly.\\n\\n Jolene stamped her foot and in a rage swept her arm across the table. Dishes and serving bowls toppled onto the floor, shattering, spilling food in all directions. Then she ran out of the kitchen and down the hall to her bedroom, slamming the door. The sound reverberated through the house.\\n\\n Bruce sank into the chair and leaned forward, resting his head in his hands. They desperately needed help. This was more than he could deal with, more than he could handle alone. How right Rachel was to insist on a counselor…. He should have taken her seriously months ago.\\n\\n He hoped it wasn’t too late.\\n\\n Twelve\\n\\n Grace Harding was in her library office reviewing the budget when she heard a knock at her door.\\n\\n “Come in,” she called, expecting her assistant.\\n\\n Beth Morehouse opened the door and stuck her head inside. “Do you have a minute?”\\n\\n Grace glanced at the clock and realized it was past closing. She’d been so involved in her review that she hadn’t noticed. “Sure, come on in.”\\n\\n Beth walked into the office carrying a picnic basket. Filled with books? Grace wondered but didn’t ask. She smiled at this woman who’d become a friend. Beth’s love for dogs resonated strongly with her. Not only was she an effective trainer who’d been instrumental in setting up the Reading with Rover program, she rescued stray and abandoned dogs. She found homes for some of them and kept others for the library program. She trained them to sit with children as they read aloud. Being with a dog relaxed children who struggled with reading and were at risk academically. While a volunteer was close at hand, the real focus was on the children and “their” dogs. And on learning to read. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/1105-yakima-street-cedar-cove-11/page-15.html","bookId":1953,"book":{"id":1953,"title":"1105 Yakima Street (Cedar Cove #11)","description":"Storyline: 1105 Yakima Street (Cedar Cove #11) \\n 1105 Yakima Street \\n Cedar Cove, Washington \\n Dear Reader, \\n You’ve probably heard that my wife has left me.
