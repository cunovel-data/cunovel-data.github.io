{"id":43362,"no":11,"title":"Chapter 10: Kidnapping A Minister.","content":"In spite of the war between the two countries, communications were frequent. Smuggling boats brought over, with their cargoes of wine and brandy, Huguenot fugitives; and, by the same means, secret agents carried back news of events in Paris to the Government. Having decided upon making for the coast without delay, Desmond and his friends next discussed the port to which they had best travel, and which seemed to offer the fairest opportunities. They agreed that Weymouth seemed to be most advantageous, as it was from there that the communications with Brittany were chiefly maintained. At the same time, it was evident that considerable difficulty would be experienced in discovering the men engaged in such traffic, and in making an arrangement with them, and it was all-important that no time should be lost, for there was no saying when the trial might come on. \"If we could but get hold of Godolphin,\" Desmond said, next morning, \"we might get an order, from him, to embark in one of the boats that carry his agents.\" The others laughed. \"Yes; and if you could get hold of Anne, you might persuade her to sign an order for the release of our comrades.\" Desmond did not answer, but sat thinking for a few minutes. \"It is not so impossible as you seem to imagine,\" he said, at last. \"Doubtless, like everyone else, he goes in a sedan chair to the meeting of the council, and returns in the same manner. There are two ways in which we could manage the matter. Of course, he has his own chair, with his chair men in livery. We might either make these men drunk and assume their dress, or attack them suddenly on the way; then we should, of course, gag and bind them, and carry him here, or to some other place that we might decide upon, and force him to give us an order for the boatmen to take us across the channel, at once. Of course, we should have horses in readiness, and ride for the coast. We should have a twelve hours\u0027 start, for it would be that time before our landlady came in as usual, with our breakfast, when Godolphin would, of course, be released.\" The two officers looked at each other, astounded at the audacity of the scheme that Desmond had quietly propounded. O\u0027Sullivan was the first to speak. \"Are you really in earnest, Kennedy?\" \"Quite in earnest. I do not see why it should not be done.\" \"Well, you are certainly the coolest hand I ever came across,\" O\u0027Neil said. \"You are proposing to seize the first minister in England, as if it were merely an affair of carrying off a pretty girl quite willing to be captured. The idea seems monstrous, and yet, as you put it, I do not see why it might not succeed.\" \"I hardly think that it could fail,\" Desmond said quietly. \"De Tulle managed to carry off the Baron de Pointdexter\u0027s daughter from the court of Versailles, and did so without any hitch or difficulty. Surely three Irishmen could arrange an affair of this sort as well as a French vicomte.\" \"If it is to be done,\" O\u0027Sullivan said, \"I think the second plan is best. You might fail in making the chair men drunk, or at any rate sufficiently drunk to allow them to be despoiled of their clothes; whereas you could have no difficulty in silencing a couple of chair men by a sudden attack--a sharp rap on the head with these bludgeons ought to settle that affair.\" \"Quite so,\" Desmond agreed; \"and while Mike and one of us were so employed, the other two might throw open the doors of the chair, and gag Godolphin before he was conscious of what was happening.\" \"It all seems simple enough, Kennedy, and, if it were a citizen, one would think nothing of the undertaking. But it is nothing short of high treason for us thus to make free with the person of the chief minister of England.\" \"That is a matter that does not concern me at all, O\u0027Neil. If we were captured now, we should be executed for high treason with the others; and if we carried off Anne herself, they could not do much more to us. \"Now, it seems to me that if you are both agreed that we should carry out the plan, the first thing to be done is to arrange for horses; or, better still, for a light cart to carry the four of us. I should think that Mike would, among his acquaintances, be able to hear of a man with a couple of fast horses and such a cart as we require, who would agree to drive us to the coast, arranging a change of horses on the way. He could offer ten louis, which would be a sum that a man of that kind would be well satisfied with.\" \"I will see to that, your honour. I have no doubt that I can find such a man without difficulty. When would you want him?\" \"Tonight, certainly, with the arrangement that, if we do not come to the appointed spot, we shall be there tomorrow night. Recollect ten louis is all we can afford, but if he wants any more, he must have it. \"Well, we will leave that to you.\" Then he went on to the others: \"We had better go down to Saint James\u0027s. Mike can go out and buy us three shock wigs, with which we can cover our hair and look our parts better. We had better separate when we get there, and watch the entrances to the palace, gazing about like rustics; then we can get into a conversation with any servant that we see, and try and find out from which door members of the council usually issue, and at about what hour. We could succeed without that, because we should notice the chairs waiting for them. Still, it is as well that we should get all the information we can. There will be, doubtless, personages leaving who have been with the Princess Anne. They might go out by another entrance, and therefore we should miss our man.\" \"You will have more than the two chair men to deal with, your honour, for there are sure to be two link men with the chair.\" \"Well, it will be as easy to dispose of four men as of two, Mike.\" \"Every bit, your honour, and the more of them the more divarsion.\" An hour later they set out, now so well disguised that no one would have dreamt that the three Irishmen were officers in a French regiment; and before noon Desmond succeeded in obtaining, from a scullion employed in the palace, the particulars that he required. On saying that he had but just come to London, and wanted to get a sight of the great people, the present of a shilling sufficed to extract the information from the boy; and Desmond then rejoined his companions, and they at once returned to their lodgings, where they found Mike awaiting them. \"I have managed it, your honour, but it will cost twelve louis. I went to the man from whom I got the saws, and he said at once that the affair could be managed easily, and, sure enough, he took me to the shop of a man who, he said, sometimes acted with cracksmen. The fellow was sharp enough to see, at once, that it was something special that we wanted the horses for, but after some bargaining he agreed to do it for twelve gold pieces, and, if necessary, to get a change of horses twice on the road. He will be ready with his cart at twelve o\u0027clock, a hundred yards or so outside the last houses on the south side of the Old Kent Road. I could not tell him which port you would go to, but he said from there he could go to Dover, or turn off so as to make for Southampton or Weymouth. It is to be twelve pounds if it is to Dover or Southampton; fifteen pounds if it is to Weymouth.\" \"That is satisfactory,\" Desmond said. \"Now we have nothing else to do till ten o\u0027clock tonight, when, as the boy said, the council generally ends; though we will be there an hour earlier, in case they should leave before. Now I think we had better find out where Godolphin\u0027s house is, and fix upon the best spot for the attack, and how we shall each station ourselves.\" This part of the business offered no difficulties. They found that the minister would probably be carried through Saint James\u0027s Park, and they fixed upon the spot where they would await his coming. Mike was to attack the first porter. O\u0027Sullivan was to follow close behind him and, at the same moment, fell the rearmost man. O\u0027Neil and Desmond, who were to conceal themselves among trees on opposite sides of the path, were to spring out and strike down the link bearers, and then enter the chair and bind and gag the minister. Mike was sent out to buy a pot of black paint, with which to efface the gildings of the chair, and to reduce its appearance to that ordinarily used by the citizens. He was ordered to get a supply of rope, and some wood, to make gags for the men they were to stun. The others were to post themselves at the spot agreed on, while Desmond was to remain at the entrance to the palace by which ministers would issue, to note Lord Godolphin\u0027s chair, and, when he was fairly on his way, to follow it for a short distance to make sure that it was being taken through the park, and then to run on and warn the others to be in readiness. On their return to their lodging, they ate the dinner that Mike had got in for them, and, as they drank their wine, laughed and joked over their enterprise; for, now that they were fairly embarked upon the scheme, the two officers were as eager as Desmond in the matter, and were much more excited over the prospect than he was. Before nine o\u0027clock, they and Mike were posted in the park, and Desmond was at the entrance to the palace. Here seven or eight chairs, with their bearers and link men, were assembled. As most of the porters were hired men, Desmond readily entered into conversation with them, and expressed his desire to see the great persons and learn which were their chairs, so that he should know them as they entered them. In half an hour there was a stir, and a servant, coming out, shouted: \"His Grace the Duke of Somerset\u0027s chair.\" This was at once brought up to the door. Next came a call for the chair of Mr. Henry Boyle, who was followed by Harcourt, the attorney general, then the chair of My Lord Godolphin was summoned. Desmond and three or four others, who had gathered to see the members of the council come out, had been ordered off by the sentries as soon as the first chair was called, but remained near enough to hear the names. To his satisfaction, Godolphin\u0027s chair was carried off in the direction they had anticipated, and he at once ran on and joined his companions. Presently, the lights carried by the two link men were seen approaching, and, as the chair came abreast of him, he shouted: \"Now!\" Almost simultaneously, the four heavy cudgels alighted on the heads of the four men, levelling them senseless to the ground; and O\u0027Neil and Desmond sprang to the chair, and wrenched the door open, while O\u0027Sullivan and Mike bound the four men, and thrust the gags into their mouths. Lord Godolphin had been thrown from his seat by the sudden fall of his bearers, and was seized and bound before he was conscious of what had happened. Then his captors assisted the others in carrying the fallen men to some distance from the path. A couple of minutes sufficed to cover the gilding and armorial bearings upon the chair. The torches were still burning on the ground. One of these was stamped out. Desmond took the other. Mike and O\u0027Sullivan went between the poles, and adjusted the leathern straps over their shoulders, and started. Emerging from the park at Charing Cross, past the old church of Saint. Martin\u0027s in the Fields, and keeping round the walls to Holborn Bars, they made their way to their lodging, and Godolphin was carried into their room, which was on the ground floor. Mike and O\u0027Neil then took the chair away, and left it in a narrow alley, where it was not likely to attract attention until the morning. Not until they returned was anything said to their prisoner. It had been agreed that O\u0027Neil, as the senior, was to be spokesman of the party. \"Lord Godolphin,\" he said, \"I regret that circumstances have obliged us to use force towards you, but our necessities compel us to leave the country at once, and it has appeared to us that in no way could we get away so expeditiously as with the aid of your lordship. We will now set you free. I must tell you, beforehand, that if you attempt to raise your voice and give the alarm, we shall be constrained to blow out your brains.\" Mike now released him from the bonds, and removed the gag from his mouth, but for a time the minister was incapable of speech, being choked by anger at the treatment he had met with. \"You will repent this outrage,\" he burst out, at last. \"I think not, sir,\" O\u0027Neil said, quietly. \"At any rate, we are quite ready to take our chance of that. In order that you may feel at ease with us, I have no hesitation in telling you who we are. We are the three French officers who, as no doubt you have heard, yesterday escaped from Newgate, and we are anxious to get out of the country as soon as possible. It will be also a guarantee to you that we have no designs on either your pockets or your person.\" Angry as he still was, it was evident, by the expression of the treasurer\u0027s face, that the information was a relief to him, for indeed he had supposed that he had been carried off by political enemies, and was very uncertain as to what would befall him. \"What is it that you require, then?\" he asked, after a pause. \"Merely this, sir. That you will give us an order, upon an agent through whom you communicate with France, to take us across the channel immediately.\" \"Well, gentlemen,\" Godolphin said, more calmly, \"I must say your coolness surprises me. Your escape yesterday was, of course, reported to us; and the manner in which you obtained that rope, by which you descended, is a mystery that the jail authorities are wholly unable to solve. \"If you obtain the order you desire, will you give me your word of honour that it shall be used in a manner in no way hostile to the interests of this country, but solely, as you say, for the purpose of conveying you across the channel?\" \"That promise we give willingly. We must ask you to pledge your honour, as a gentleman, that the order you give us will be a genuine one--a matter that we cannot ascertain until we arrive at the address given. We are willing to play fairly with you, sir, but if you do not do the same, we shall certainly return to London, though in some different guise, and, if so, I warn you that no guards will save you from our vengeance.\" \"You need not threaten, sir,\" Lord Godolphin said calmly. \"I will give you the order, to the person to whom such communications are addressed, and it shall be couched in the same words as usual.\" Desmond placed a sheet of paper, pen, and ink before him. He, dating it from the Treasury, wrote: To John Dawkins, Mariner, High Street, Rye. Urgent. On the receipt of this, you will at once convey the bearer, and three persons with him, and land them in some convenient spot in France. He then added his signature. \"Now, gentlemen, what next?\" he said, looking up. O\u0027Neil looked at his companions, and then they spoke for a moment together. \"We are about to start at once, my lord,\" he said, \"and it was our intention to have left you bound and gagged, until the morning, when the woman of the house would have assuredly found you and released you. But, as you have acceded to our request at once, we will, if you give us your word of honour that you will raise no alarm, and say no word of this business until eight o\u0027clock tomorrow morning, let you depart at once.\" \"Thank you for your courtesy, gentlemen, and for your confidence in my honour. I am, indeed, anxious to return home at once. If I do not do so, there will be a hue and cry for me, and by the time I return in the morning all London will know that I am missing. I naturally should not wish this adventure to become a matter of common talk: in the first place, because the position in which you have placed me can scarcely be called a pleasant one; and secondly, because the success of your enterprise might lead others to make similar attempts on my person, or that of my colleagues. Even now, I fear that my servants, when sufficiently recovered, will go to my house and give the alarm.\" \"I do not think that that is likely to be the case, my lord,\" O\u0027Neil said, \"as we took the precaution of gagging and binding them, and laid them down some distance from the roadside. If, on your return home, you find they have not arrived, you have but to send a couple of your servants out to release them. You can give them strict orders that no word is to be said of the affair, and make them to understand you were attacked in error, and that the ruffians who took part in the outrage at once released you, upon discovering your identity.\" \"Very good, sir,\" Godolphin said, with a grim smile. \"I must really compliment you all on your fertility of resource and invention. And now, is there anything else that I can do for you?\" \"There is one small favour,\" Desmond said. \"Your lordship has doubtless twenty guineas in your possession. You would greatly oblige us if you would give us them, for so many louis. These you will have no difficulty in exchanging, whereas the exhibition of French money, on our part, might excite suspicion.\" Lord Godolphin placed his hand in his pocket, drew out a heavy purse, and, opening it, counted out twenty guineas. O\u0027Neil took these up, and handed to him twenty louis pieces. \"One more question, gentlemen. What has become of my sedan chair?\" \"It is in an alley, hard by,\" O\u0027Neil said, \"and as we are ourselves going in your direction we will carry it to your door.\" \"You are obliging, indeed, sir. If it had been found, the escutcheon on the panels would have shown that it was mine.\" \"I fear, my lord, that you will have to have it repainted; for, before starting with you, we took the precaution to put black paint over the gilding and panels. Still, the lining and fittings would show that it belonged to some person of wealth and importance. As you have been so obliging to us, we will gladly escort you, with it, to your door.\" \"I shall be glad, indeed, of that, gentlemen, for I certainly should not care about travelling alone through these lanes and alleys, which have by no means a good reputation.\" \"We are ready to start at once, my lord,\" O\u0027Neil said. \"We have a long journey to perform, and, although there is now no need for extraordinary speed, we shall be glad to be off.\" They were ready at once, having settled with their landlady before starting out in the evening, telling her that they had heard of a job and should start early in the morning. Mike and Desmond fetched the empty chair, and they then started, Godolphin walking with the other officers in front. \"This is the most surprising adventure that ever happened to me,\" Lord Godolphin said; \"and it is a pity that officers who possess the wit to plan an escape from Newgate, and to ensure a speedy flight from the country by carrying me off, are not in the service of Her Majesty.\" \"We may yet be in the British service some day, my lord,\" O\u0027Sullivan laughed; \"but I may tell you that my friend, and myself, disclaim any credit in contriving the matter of which you spoke, that being solely the work of our young comrade, who is at present the youngest ensign in our regiment.\" \"Then he must be a shrewd fellow, indeed,\" Godolphin said, \"likely to do service in any position to which he may attain.\" They walked sharply. Several times rough men came and peered at them, but Godolphin was wrapped in a cloak, and the appearance of those with him showed that hard knocks, rather than booty, would be the result of interfering with them. On reaching Lord Godolphin\u0027s house they placed the sedan chair on the steps. \"Goodnight to you, gentlemen, and good fortune!\" Lord Godolphin said. \"The lesson has not been lost, and I shall take good care, in future, to have a strong escort.\" They then crossed Westminster Bridge, and made rapidly for the spot where the cart was waiting for them. \"You are an hour after your time,\" the man said. \"I had begun to think that something had gone wrong with you.\" \"That is not the case,\" O\u0027Neil said; \"but we have certainly been detained longer than we anticipated.\" \"Where are we going to?\" \"To Rye.\" \"That will suit me very well,\" the man said. \"I have friends along that road, and shall have no trouble about horses.\" They started at once, at a rattling pace, the animals, though but sorry-looking creatures, being speedy and accustomed to long journeys. It was evident, from the man\u0027s manner, that he believed his passengers were cracksmen who had just successfully carried out an enterprise of importance. He expressed surprise that they had brought no luggage with them. They did not care to undeceive him. Mike had brought with him a bottle of good brandy, and a drink of this soon removed the vexation the man had felt at being kept waiting for them. Twice during the journey they changed horses, each time at small wayside inns, where some password, given by the driver, at once roused the landlord into activity. But a few minutes were spent in the changes, and the fifty miles to Rye were accomplished in seven hours--a very unusual rate of speed along the badly kept roads of the period. When the car drew up in the High Street of Rye, the four occupants were scarce able to stand, so bruised and shaken were they by their rapid passage over the rough road. They handed the twelve pounds agreed upon to the driver, adding another as a token of their satisfaction at the speed at which he had driven them, and then enquired for the house of William Dawkins. It was close by, and upon knocking at the door, it was opened by the man himself. \"I have a message to deliver to you, in private,\" O\u0027Neil said. The man nodded, and led the way indoors, where the letter was handed to him. \"That is all right,\" he said. \"My craft is always ready to set sail, at an hour\u0027s notice, and if the wind holds fair I will land you on the French coast before nightfall. I see that your business is urgent, or you would not have put on disguises before leaving London. I suppose you have brought other clothes to land in?\" \"We have not,\" O\u0027Neil said. \"We came away in such a hurry that we did not think of it until on the road, and then we thought that we might procure them here.\" \"There will be no difficulty about that,\" the sailor said. \"I will go out, and warn my men that we shall sail in half an hour, and then I can get any garments that you desire; for, doubtless, you do not wish to attract comment by the purchase of clothes that would seem unfitted to your present position.\" \"That is so,\" O\u0027Sullivan said, \"and we shall gladly embrace your offer. We should like three suits, such as are worn by persons of fair position in France, and one proper for a serving man.\" \"I cannot get you quite French fashion, sir, but they do not differ much from our own; and with a cloak each, I have no doubt that you would pass without attracting attention--that is, of course, if you speak French well.\" \"As well as English,\" O\u0027Neil said. \"Here are seven pounds in gold, which will, I should think, be sufficient. If not, we are provided with French gold, for use after landing there.\" \"I have no doubt it will suffice, sir. If not, I will pay what is the excess, and you can settle with me afterwards.\" In three-quarters of an hour after their arrival at Rye, they were dressed in their new disguises and on board the little lugger, which at once started down the river, which was at that time much more free from shoals and difficulties than it is at present. \"Your boat seems fast,\" Desmond remarked, as, having cleared the mouth of the river, she put out to sea. \"She is fast, sir; the fastest thing that sails out of Rye. She needs be, for the gentlemen who come to me are always in a hurry.\" \"I suppose you have no fear of English cruisers?\" \"Not at all. I have the order you brought with you, and have only to show it to any English ship of war that overhauls us, for them to let us go on at once. I am careful when I get near the French coast, for although their big craft never venture out far, there are numbers of chasse-maree patrolling the coast. However, even if caught by them, it would be but a temporary detention, for I am well known at Etaples, which is always my port, unless specially directed to land my passengers elsewhere.\" The wind was fresh and favourable, and at six o\u0027clock in the afternoon they entered the little port. Some gendarmes came down to the wharf. \"We need have no fear of them,\" William Dawkins said. \"Their lieutenant is paid handsomely for keeping his eyes shut, and asking no questions.\" \"So you are back again,\" the officer said. \"Why, it is not a week since you were here!\" \"No, it is but six days since I sailed.\" \"And you have four passengers?\" \"That\u0027s the number, sir. The Irish gentlemen are desirous of entering the service of France.\" The officer nodded. \"Well, gentlemen, you will find plenty of your countrymen in Paris; and, as everyone knows, there are no better or braver soldiers in His Majesty\u0027s service.\" The friends had already enquired, from William Dawkins, whether there was any passage money to pay, saying that they had forgotten to ask before starting. \"Not at all. I am well paid by Government. My boat is always retained at a price that suits me well, and I get so much extra for every voyage I make. No, sir, thank you; I will take nothing for myself, but if you like to give half a guinea to the crew, to drink success to you, I will not say no.\" The party made no stay at Etaples, but at once ordered a chaise and post horses. Then, changing at every post house, and suffering vastly less discomfort than they experienced in the journey to Rye--the roads being better kept in France than they were on the English side of the channel--they arrived in Paris at eleven o\u0027clock next day.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3119/85815.html","bookId":905,"book":{"id":905,"title":"In the Irish Brigade","description":"简介： The evils arising from religious persecution, sectarian hatred, ill government, and oppression were never more strongly illustrated than by the fact that, for a century, Ireland, which has since that time furnished us with a large proportion of our b...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3119","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:50 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:50 AM"}}
