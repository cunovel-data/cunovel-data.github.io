{"id":43367,"no":16,"title":"Chapter 15: Treachery.","content":"At this moment an officer came down, and said that the governor wished to see Colonel Mendez and Major Kennedy, at once. As they entered the room, they saw the governor walking up and down in a state of great agitation. \"I hear, Colonel Mendez,\" he said, stopping before that officer, \"that you have, on your own authority, placed several of the commissariat storekeepers under arrest. What does this mean, sir?\" \"It means, sir, that Major Kennedy has discovered enormous deficiencies in the stores, and there can be little doubt that a number of persons must have been concerned in the matter, besides those in charge of the storehouses. Wholesale bribery must have been practised, by those who supplied the goods to those whose duty it was to receive them.\" \"I shall order a commission of enquiry to sit at once, and beg that you, Colonel Mendez, will send me in a detailed report of the matter, which is, I need hardly say, one of extreme gravity.\" \"I was right,\" Colonel Mendez said, as they left the governor\u0027s house. \"I suspected that something was wrong, ever since he refused to allow me access to the magazines. I have no doubt that he has been acting in collusion with the contractors, though he may not have been aware of the extent of their rascality, for his subordinates may not only have accepted bribes from the contractors to carry out the frauds to which the governor may have consented, but may also have taken money from these to allow of still greater ones to be perpetrated.\" \"What will he do, do you think, Colonel?\" \"He will endeavour, by every means in his power, to prevent any word of your discovery from leaking out. And, if I may advise you, I should say it would be well that you should take every precaution for your own safety. His position is a desperate one, for one cannot doubt that your report will be followed by his removal from his post, his dismissal from the army, and the confiscation of everything of which he is possessed. Therefore, it is almost a matter of life and death to him to prevent your report from being sent to headquarters, and to have you removed altogether. This done, the facts might not leak out. It would be supposed, at Madrid, that you had been stabbed by some street ruffian. And, although another officer might be sent down to report, it is by no means likely that he would go so rigorously into matters as you did, but would be contented merely to count barrels and bales, without troubling to investigate their contents.\" \"But your evidence would be as strong against him as mine.\" \"Yes; but that evidence is not yet given. He can, in the first place, and I have no doubt will, suppress my report to him. In the second place, he would consider it unlikely that I should venture to make the matter public, for he has powerful friends at court. He is connected with many of the leading families in the province, and might rely upon being able to hush the matter up, so long as it was known only to the heads of our army, who are not unaware that, although the pay of a commander of a fortress is not more than sufficient to maintain his position, they, like most other of our officials, generally retire with considerable fortunes. Therefore, any interference on my part would be more disastrous to my prospects than to his. \"It is humiliating to say so, Major Kennedy, but both our civil and military systems are rotten to the core. There are, of course, honest men in both services, but as a rule corruption is almost universal. Still, although he cannot fear me as he must fear you, it is possible he may endeavour to make himself safe by removing me also from his path; and for a time I shall take good care to remain in my own barracks, as much as possible.\" \"I will be careful also,\" Desmond said, \"and I thank you much for the warning, which was needed, for it would never have struck me that he would even attempt to suppress the information that I have gained; but I see that it will be necessary to be very careful, especially in the manner of sending off my reports.\" \"If I were in your place, I should mount my horse at once, and with the troopers of the escort ride straight for Madrid.\" \"I cannot do that, Colonel, for the examination into the state of the stores here was only a part of my instructions, and I must, if possible, carry these out to the letter before leaving for Madrid. I might, however, send off my despatch by two of the troopers with me.\" \"I think you may take my word for it, Major, that they would never reach their destination. Even while we are speaking, a messenger may be sent off either to one of these bands in the mountains, or to two or three of the contractors--who are, of course, as deeply involved as the governor, for there is no doubt of their guilt, while no proof can be given to his being a party to it--telling them that it is a matter of life and death to them to prevent you or your messengers from reaching Madrid.\" \"The lookout is certainly far from comfortable,\" Desmond admitted, \"and I must, tonight, think it over in every way, and decide upon what course I had best pursue.\" When he reached the hotel, he told Mike what Colonel Mendez had said. \"By the powers, your honour, it is a nasty scrape that we seem to be in, almost as bad as when you were shut up in that prison in London.\" \"Worse, Mike; for then we knew that we should be tried, but hoped that Louis would interfere in our favour, and by threatening reprisals obtain our liberty; whereas here we have only ourselves to depend upon, and the blow may come at any moment.\" \"Well, at any rate, your honour, we will see that none get at you unbeknown. I will lie down in your room against the door, and if the sergeant places a man on guard outside, it is hard if anyone gets at you.\" \"I hardly think the precaution necessary; but there is no saying what this man might not do in so desperate a situation, so I will tell the sergeant to place a sentry at the door, and to relieve him every two hours. I shall think the matter over, and by tomorrow morning shall decide whether I had best remain here and complete my work, or ride at once to Madrid.\" At about two o\u0027clock in the morning Desmond, who had but just dropped off to sleep, was aroused by hearing the sentry outside his door challenge. There was no answer. All remained quiet. Mike leapt to his feet and opened the door. \"What is it?\" he asked the sentry. \"I saw two or three men at the end of the corridor. It was too dark to make them out clearly. They were coming this way. I levelled my carbine and cried, \u0027Who comes there?\u0027 and at once they stole away. They could have been after no good, for their steps were noiseless, and they must have come up without boots.\" \"Keep a sharp lookout, sentry,\" Desmond said, \"and see that they don\u0027t steal up to you, for if they do, you may be stabbed before you have time to turn round. \"It is lucky that I carried out your suggestion, Mike, and posted a sentry at the door. Of course, these men the sentry saw may not have been coming here, but at any rate their conduct was suspicious.\" In a few minutes Desmond was again asleep. He had had a long day\u0027s work, and believing that the affair was over, at least for the night, he did not even try to keep awake. As soon as Mike heard, by his breathing, that he was asleep, he got up noiselessly and seated himself near the open window, with a loaded pistol. An hour passed, and then he heard a slight stir in the street. He did not look out, but grasped his pistol tightly. Their room was on the first floor. Presently, he heard a grating sound against the window. It was very dark, and he knelt down so that he would be able to make out any figure that showed above the windowsill. He thought first of rousing his master, but as he had another pistol in his belt, and his sword leaned against the wall, ready to his hand, he thought it better to let matters take their course. He had heard no further sound, but presently a round object appeared in sight. Stretching out his arm, he fired without a moment\u0027s hesitation. There was a sound of a heavy fall below, followed by some muttered exclamations. In a moment, Desmond was on his feet, a pistol which he had laid by his pillow in his grasp. \"What is it, Mike?\" \"It is only a gentleman who had a fancy for looking in at the window, your honour, and I have no doubt would have come in, without saying by your leave, if I had not cut the matter short by putting a bullet into his forehead. He had some friends down below. He came up on a ladder.\" He looked out of the window. \"They are taking it down now, your honour. Shall I give them another shot?\" \"No, Mike; let them go. The lesson has been good enough.\" The sentry had also run into the room, on hearing the shot. \"It is all over,\" Desmond said. \"Seeing that you prevented them from getting in at the door, they tried the window. Mike has shot one of them.\" There was a sound of feet and loud talking in the passage, and as Desmond went out, the landlord, two of the serving men, and several of those staying at the hotel ran up. \"What is it, senor? We heard a shot.\" \"Yes; a fellow tried to enter my window, by means of a ladder; but fortunately my man heard him, and shot him before he came in. No doubt it was some prowling marauder, who, seeing my window open, thought that there was a chance of plunder.\" \"Carrambo!\" the landlord exclaimed, \"then we shall have enquiries, and all sorts of trouble.\" \"I don\u0027t think you will,\" Desmond said quietly. \"I fancy he had some friends down below, and they will probably carry his body and the ladder away, and, if you hold your tongues, nothing more will be heard of it. \"Mike, do you and the sentry take a lantern and go down and see.\" The landlord looked out of the window. \"As far as I can see, everything is quiet there,\" he said. \"Are you sure that your servant was not dreaming?\" \"That you will soon ascertain, if you go down with him,\" Desmond said. \"I fancy that you will find some traces of the affair there.\" The landlord, followed by his two servants, went down with the soldiers, and then, lighting a lantern and handing it to them, went out, keeping carefully behind them. \"There,\" Mike said, when he stopped under Desmond\u0027s window; \"does that look like a dream?\" and he pointed to a patch of blood on the pavement. \"It is true enough,\" the landlord said. \"Pedro and Lopez, fetch pails of water and brooms, and get rid of this blood, otherwise we shall be having enquiries made in the morning.\" Mike returned to his master, at whose door the sergeant and the other troopers were standing. \"There is no occasion, sergeant,\" Desmond had just said, \"to keep a sentry at the door any longer. We can be quite sure that we shall not be disturbed again before morning, and indeed, I am not likely to sleep after this.\" \"Very well, sir; but if you don\u0027t mind, I will keep a sentry on watch.\" \"Just as you like, sergeant, but I feel sure there is no occasion for it. Still, after what has happened, it may perhaps be wise to do so.\" \"Well, Mike,\" Desmond said, when they were again alone, \"the campaign has opened with spirit. This is something like that journey with the Baron de Pointdexter, when we expected to be attacked every minute.\" \"Well, we got through that all right, your honour, and it is hard if we don\u0027t get through this.\" At six o\u0027clock, a volley of musketry was fired. \"They are practising early, sir,\" Mike said. \"It can\u0027t be that, Mike. It is too close. They would go beyond the outer works to practise, and, by the sound, it is certainly much nearer than that, though possibly just outside the walls.\" \"I will go out and enquire, your honour. When one is at war, it is as well to know exactly what the enemy are doing.\" \"Take one of the troopers with you, Mike. Pierre speaks Spanish well.\" Mike returned in an hour. \"They have shot all the prisoners we took yesterday,\" he said. \"I hear they held a sort of court martial in the evening, at the governor\u0027s. It did not sit more than ten minutes. They were all found guilty of fraud and treachery, and were shot this morning.\" \"Worse and worse, Mike! Evidently, the governor is determined to get rid of all whose evidence might throw any light on this matter. After what has happened here, and these summary executions, I feel very uncomfortable as to Colonel Mendez. Will you go to the artillery barracks with a message from me that, as I have my first report to write out, I shall not continue the investigations today? Take Pierre with you again.\" When Mike returned, Desmond saw that his news was bad. \"The colonel had not been seen when I got there, and his servant went up to his room and found him lying dead, stabbed to the heart.\" \"Another witness gone,\" Desmond said. \"An honourable gentleman, and a pleasant one. Well, Mike, the matter becomes more and more serious. After this there is but one thing open to me, and that is to return to Madrid at once. When I relate the circumstances to the duke, he will see that, had I endeavoured to carry out the rest of his instructions, the chance of my report ever coming to hand would have been slight indeed, and it is all important that he should get it. \"The question is, shall we mount and ride at once, or shall I go and take leave of the governor?\" \"Of course, your honour, you can do as you like, but I should say that the sooner we are out of this, the better. The longer we stay here, the more time he will have to take care we don\u0027t get back alive. \"There was another thing I did not tell you, sir. As we went to the barracks, we passed some cavalry men talking. They were arguing that the enemy must be marching this way, for at two o\u0027clock last night ten troopers were suddenly called up and sent off, the gates being opened for them by order of the governor.\" \"Just what I expected, Mike. He has written to warn the various contractors that the frauds have been discovered, and, no doubt, telling them that all messengers from here must be stopped and searched, and all reports and documents taken from them; that if I come myself, I am to be put out of the way; and that if this can be done the matter can be hushed up, as he has taken measures to silence all those who know anything about the affair. \"Well, I think you are right. We need not mind saying goodbye to this scoundrel, as it would only give him time to perfect his arrangements. I have no doubt that he would pretend to be ill, or to be engaged in some business that would detain him, and manage to keep me waiting some hours before he saw me. Order the sergeant to saddle up at once. Let the men eat a meal as quickly as possible, and let each put a bottle of wine and a loaf of bread into his valise, so that we shall be able to ride without stopping anywhere. Say that we shall mount in twenty minutes, and they must not wait to polish up their accoutrements. Tell them to put plenty of forage before the horses, and not to put the bridles in their mouths until the last thing. Let each pour four or five feeds of corn into his forage bag. \"When you have given the orders, have your own breakfast. I will go downstairs and get something there. I packed my valises while you were away.\" Exactly twenty minutes later the little troop started. The men had, at Desmond\u0027s orders, loaded their pistols and short guns. Avoiding the principal streets, they rode by narrow lanes until they emerged close to the eastern gate. Through this he and his followers rode, without question, at a quiet pace until beyond the exterior fortifications, across the bridge over the Guadiana, and then broke into a canter. The sergeant and men were not a little surprised at the sudden departure, for they had supposed that they would remain for some time at Badajos. Desmond called the sergeant up to his side. \"I dare say you are surprised at this sudden move, but you know that two attempts were made upon my life last night, and I have no doubt that these would be repeated, and perhaps with greater success, had I stayed there. You were present yesterday, with two of your men, when we discovered that large portions of the stores were mere dummies filled with earth. Whether or not the governor was a party to the fraud I cannot say, but this morning he had all the storekeepers who were arrested shot, and Colonel Mendez, who was present at the investigation, was murdered during the night. It is evident, therefore, that many people are interested in preventing the discovery we made from getting known. Of course, the soldiers who assisted would be aware of it, but they would not venture to speak, and it is only I and your men and my servant who have still to be silenced. \"I tell you this, in order that you may impress upon the men the necessity for the greatest vigilance, such as they would use if travelling through an enemy\u0027s country. Messengers were, I hear, sent off yesterday evening in various directions, and I have no doubt that these were to the various contractors concerned in the plot, urging upon them the necessity of preventing the news from reaching Madrid; and perhaps to some of the robber bands in the sierra. Therefore, instead of keeping the main road up the valley, we will ride by country tracks and avoid all large towns. We will not put up anywhere, but will bivouac in the open. In this way I hope that we shall yet avoid any parties of men who may be lying in wait for us. \"The most dangerous part of the journey will, of course, be the passage of the mountains. We must there travel by one or other of the roads through the defiles, and it is possible all these may be watched. If we are attacked, we must endeavour to ride through them. If this is impossible, we will sell our lives as dearly as we can.\" \"You may trust us for that, Major,\" the sergeant said. \"I have no love for these Spaniards, and we are all discontented at being kept down here to fight the King of Spain\u0027s battles, instead of being up in the north, where every man is wanted to prevent the enemy marching to Paris.\" They struck off from the road when nearing Merida, and followed a country track until they came upon the road between that town and Torre Mocha. Avoiding the latter place, they took the road to Truxillo, and, late in the afternoon, approached that town and halted in a wood two miles distant from it. Here Desmond consulted his map. There were two roads from Truxillo. Crossing the sierra, the main and shorter road came down upon the Tagus at Almarez. The other passed through Deleytoza, and came down upon the bridge at Condo. Beyond Deleytoza it appeared to be a mere mule track. \"If there are any parties watching,\" he said to Mike, \"they will expect that my messenger, or I myself, will travel by the main road to Almarez, for not only is it better, but it is shorter. But again, they might think that, if I suspected we might be attacked, I should take the road through Deleytoza, and would, at any rate, make matters safe by watching both roads. It is a difficult question which to choose.\" \"Well, your honour, if you have got to fight, it would be best to do so on a good road. Our horses would be of no use to us, if we were going single file along a bad road; while on a good road we could charge the spalpeens, and cut our way through.\" \"You are quite right, Mike, and we will take the main road. They will not be mounted, and I don\u0027t think they would stand before a charge of seven men; but they may shoot some of us as we come down upon them. \"See here, Mike, this is my report that I wrote out yesterday evening;\" and he took a packet from the inside of his coat. \"When we start tomorrow morning I shall put it in my left holster. If I am shot, you will not wait for a moment, but will snatch it out and ride on to Madrid, and deliver it to the duke there. I have, this morning, added a few lines relating the murder of Colonel Mendez, the hurried trial and execution of the storekeepers, and the attempts upon my life, and said I have not the least doubt that the governor is at the bottom of it all.\" \"If your honour is killed, I will carry out your orders, but if it is only wounded you are, I will try to take you off with me.\" \"You must do as I order you.\" \"I obey your honour\u0027s orders when they are reasonable,\" Mike said doggedly; \"but leave you behind, to have your throat cut by those villains! I would not do such a thing, so there is an end of it.\" Desmond smiled at the earnestness of his faithful follower. \"Well, Mike, you must be guided by circumstances; but remember, it is of extreme importance that this report should reach the Duke of Orleans. Unless he has it we may lose Badajos, and the cause suffer irreparable injury.\" \"To the devil wid the cause,\" Mike said. \"The cause doesn\u0027t trouble me one way or the other. I don\u0027t care a brass farthing whether Philip or Charles reigns over the Spaniards. It is not a nice job they will be taking on, any way, and not worth a drop of Irish blood. Well, if your honour should have the bad fortune to be hit, I shall either carry you off, though there\u0027s not a breath in your body, or else go down with you.\" As there was no doubt that Mike meant what he said, Desmond did not press the matter further. The next day they set out at daybreak, and, in two hours, were mounting the slope of the sierra. There were no signs of any men being about, until they reached a point where the road ran between steep hills. \"There they are,\" Desmond exclaimed, reining in his horse. \"There are some thirty or forty of them on the road. \"Now, my men, we will ride forward to those boulders you see, a hundred yards this side of them, and then we will dismount and give them a volley. If you keep that up, it will soon be too hot for them to remain on the road; while we, sheltered behind the rocks, will be safe from their shot. It is certain that your guns will carry farther and shoot straighter than theirs, as the Spanish powder is so much inferior to the French.\" Accordingly, they rode forward at a canter to the heap of boulders, then suddenly left the road, dismounted, and took cover among the rocks. \"Take steady aim, men,\" Desmond said, \"then you can hardly miss hitting some of them, standing close together as they do.\" The bandits had waited, undecided, at the sudden disappearance of those whom they had regarded as a certain prey; and before they could form any plans, five muskets flashed out, and four of their number fell. A cry of rage burst from them, and there was a general discharge of their guns, the balls pattering thickly against the stones. The soldiers now fired as quickly as they could load, doing considerable execution. Their foes left the road, and imitated them by taking shelter behind stones. For ten minutes the combat continued, and then a party of men were seen, mounting the hill on either side. \"That is just what I hoped for,\" Desmond said. \"Fire at them, so as to force them to climb a little higher up the hill. As soon as they are pretty well out of gunshot, we will mount and charge down the road. There cannot be many men left there.\" His orders were followed. Some of the men on the hillside dropped, and the others continued to mount the slopes. When, as they believed, out of fire, they moved forward so as to take the defenders of the rocks in flank. \"Now, fire a volley among the men in front of us,\" Desmond said. \"We are not likely to hit any of them, but it is sure to draw their fire, and there will not be many unemptied guns as we pass them.\" As he expected, the volley was answered by a general fire from their hidden foes. Then the party leapt into their saddles, and, pistol in hand, galloped up the road. Several hurried shots were fired from the front, and then, at a shout from their leader, some twenty men leapt from their hiding places and ran down into the road. Desmond was supported on one side by Mike, and on the other by the sergeant. He dropped his reins--the horse had learned to obey the motions of his knees--and, drawing his sword, rode straight at the bandits. Only a few muskets were discharged, and these so hurriedly that the balls missed their aim, and, with a shout, the party fell upon the brigands. The pistols of the troopers and Mike cracked out, but they had no need to draw their swords, for the rush of the horses struck such a panic into the Spaniards that they sprang from the road, leaving the path clear, and the party thundered past them without a check. \"Is anyone wounded?\" Desmond asked, when they had passed beyond gunshot of their assailants. \"I have a ball in my shoulder, Major,\" one of the troopers said. The rest were silent. \"Well, we have been fortunate,\" Desmond said. \"I will see to your wound, my man, when we get a little farther. If those fellows had not been so scared with our sudden charge that they fired almost at random, we might have lost half our number.\" They stopped half a mile farther, and Desmond examined the trooper\u0027s arm. \"The ball has gone through the flesh,\" he said, \"without touching the bone, so you will soon have the use of it again.\" He bound the wound tightly up with the soldier\u0027s sash; and then made, with his own, a sling. \"You may as well put the other arm in your jacket,\" he said, \"and I will tie it round your neck. The air is cold upon the hills.\" \"We did that well, sir,\" the sergeant said, as they rode on again. \"If you had not thought of taking shelter, and shaking them up, we should all have been shot down before we reached them. \"Is there any chance of another attack, sir?\" \"None at all. I should think a messenger was sent to them, yesterday, telling them our strength; and no doubt they thought that, with sixty men, they would be certain to overpower us. That is probably the whole of the band, and in any case, as they would not imagine that we could pass them, they are not likely to have set another ambush.\" They slept that night at Almarez, made a short journey to Oropesa, and a long one on the following day to Toledo, where Desmond dismissed his escort, with a handsome reward for their services, and upon the next afternoon rode with Mike into Madrid. The Duke of Orleans looked astonished when he entered the room. \"What! Back already, Major Kennedy? Surely you cannot have carried out all the work that I entrusted to you?\" \"By no means, Your Royal Highness; but what I did carry out was so important that I deemed it my duty to ride back at once, to acquaint you with what I have discovered. There is the report, sir.\" The duke took it. \"It is a bulky one,\" he said. \"Tell me its purport in as few words as possible.\" \"I have discovered, sir, that the report sent by the governor of the supply of provisions and stores in Badajos is altogether inaccurate, that frauds to an enormous extent have been perpetrated, that the supply of powder and cartridges is less by two-thirds than was represented, and that similar deficiencies exist in every department.\" \"This is indeed serious,\" the duke said. \"The possession of Badajos is essential to us. It blocks the way to an enemy\u0027s advance, and indeed, they can scarce move forward until it is captured. Now, tell me more about it; or no, I will read your report, and then question you concerning it.\" A heavy frown settled on the duke\u0027s brow, as he perused the document. \"Infamous!\" he exclaimed, when he had finished. \"And you say that two attempts were made to murder you that night, and that the Spanish colonel who gave you so much assistance was assassinated, and the commissaries shot the next morning? It shows how anxious the governor was to remove from his path all those who could inculpate him. \"And how did you manage to get out of the toils? For it was clearly of no use killing the minor witnesses, and allowing you to ride here to report the facts.\" \"I saw that, sir; and as I learned that eight or ten troopers had been sent off, late the night before, I concluded that the road would be sure to be beset, for doubtless some of the contractors would feel it as essential as the governor did, that my mouth should be silenced and my report suppressed. I therefore started early. Keeping by byroads, we were not molested until we had nearly reached the summit of the sierra, when we found a party of some sixty men barring the road. We had a fight with them, and succeeded in getting through with no further damage than a ball through the arm of one of my escort, and that, fortunately, was only a flesh wound.\" \"But tell me how it was that so small a party escaped so easily?\" Desmond then recounted the incidents of the fight. \"Admirably contrived, sir!\" the duke said warmly. \"Excellent generalship! You first attack their centre and drive them off the road, then you compel them to weaken themselves by throwing out flanking parties. You keep these out of musket shot, and then charge on their weakened centre after drawing their fire. I am not surprised that, with such generalship, you got off almost scatheless. \"And now, sir, I must ask you to come with me to the king. The matter is too serious for a moment\u0027s delay. I must lay the whole case before His Majesty.\" Leaving Desmond in the antechamber, he went in to the king, read the full report to him, and added the details he had heard from Desmond. \"I have met with many bad cases of Spanish corruption and peculation,\" the king said, when he had finished, \"but this is by far the worst. Steps must be taken instantly to secure the governor, arrest the contractors, and fill up the magazines. What do you propose?\" \"I think, sir, that if we send forward, at once, a regiment of French soldiers from Toledo, accompanied by Colonel Crofton\u0027s regiment of dragoons, there is no likelihood that any resistance will be offered--indeed, I should imagine that the governor will have taken to flight, as soon as he learns that his plans for the assassination of Major Kennedy have failed.\" \"So I should think,\" the king said; \"and certainly he will have warned his accomplices, the contractors; and probably, by this time, they are all on their way either into Andalusia or to the north. Any that are found shall certainly be hanged. \"This young officer of yours must be a wonderfully shrewd fellow. I should like to question him as to how he discovered these frauds.\" Desmond was called in. \"This is Major Kennedy, Your Majesty,\" the duke said. \"That is his temporary rank, which I bestowed upon him in order to add weight to his mission.\" \"I have noticed him before, cousin,\" Philip said, \"when I had gone to your quarters, and wondered to see so young a man in the uniform of a captain. \"Now, sir, will you give me an account of how you discovered these frauds?\" Desmond then related how he had caused the piles of barrels to be opened out, so that he could examine those next to the wall as well as those in front; and how he had similarly examined the other stores. \"Very good, indeed, sir,\" the king said. \"Most officers would have contented themselves with, at most, counting the number of barrels and sacks; and that you should have so thoroughly investigated the matter shows both zeal and shrewdness.\" \"He has shown that on various occasions,\" the duke said, \"as you may judge from the promotion that he has received. As you see, by the loss of his hand, he has suffered as well as fought on behalf of France. When Your Majesty is at leisure I will, some evening, relate to you a story which I heard from the king himself, of the manner in which he, twice, rescued a fair damsel from an evil-minded noble who carried her off.\" \"I shall hear it with pleasure, cousin. You say he holds only temporary rank. I think that, after the signal service he has rendered, it should be made substantial.\" \"I certainly intend to make it so,\" the duke said. \"Pardon, sir,\" Desmond said, \"but, while thanking you for your kindness, I would beg to be allowed to remain a captain. Already I have obtained more promotion than others have done, after many years of good service, and I should regret very much passing over the heads of so many of my old companions.\" \"It is the first time that I have had promotion declined,\" the duke said, smiling. \"However, for the present, at least, I will let the matter remain so.\" With an expression of warm thanks, Desmond retired. \"We must lose no time over this matter,\" the king said. \"For aught we know, this scoundrel may be in communication with the enemy, and may be prepared to open the gates of the fortress at the first summons.\" \"I will act at once,\" the duke replied. \"I will, this evening, send orders to Toledo for a regiment to march at nine o\u0027clock tomorrow morning, and, if you will send a similar order to Colonel Crofton, he will overtake the infantry before they get to Almarez.\" \"I will do so, and will also send with them three field officers, with full power to arrest, try, and execute all those who have taken part in this treacherous fraud.\" On the duke leaving the king, Desmond joined him in the antechamber, and as they walked towards the French headquarters, said: \"I hope, sir, that you will permit me to start tomorrow with any force you may be sending, as I wish to carry out the rest of the mission with which you entrusted me.\" \"By all means, do so if you wish it,\" the duke said. \"Colonel Crofton\u0027s regiment will start at nine o\u0027clock tomorrow morning, and you may accompany it. On the road it will overtake one of our regiments from Toledo.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3119/85820.html","bookId":905,"book":{"id":905,"title":"In the Irish Brigade","description":"简介： The evils arising from religious persecution, sectarian hatred, ill government, and oppression were never more strongly illustrated than by the fact that, for a century, Ireland, which has since that time furnished us with a large proportion of our b...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3119","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:50 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:50 AM"}}
