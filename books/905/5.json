{"id":43356,"no":5,"title":"Chapter 4: At Versailles.","content":"The regiment was on the point of falling in, on the parade ground, when Desmond Kennedy rode up. Leaping from his horse, he threw the reins to his servant. \"Take them both round to the stables, and put them in spare stalls, Mike. I will get leave off parade for both of us, and ask the surgeon to dress your wounds properly.\" Then he went up to the colonel, who was just entering the barrack yard. \"Colonel O\u0027Brien,\" he said, \"I must ask your leave off parade, for, as you see, I am scarcely in a condition to take my place with my company.\" \"So it would seem, Mr. Kennedy. You have been in trouble, I see. Nothing serious, I hope?\" \"Nothing at all, sir, as far as I am concerned. It is merely a graze from a pistol ball.\" \"Well, I must hear about it, afterwards.\" \"I must also ask leave off parade for Callaghan, my servant, sir. He is hurt a good deal more than I am, though not, I hope, seriously.\" The colonel nodded. \"I will send the surgeon to your quarters, and he will see to you both.\" As Desmond left the colonel, his two chums came up. \"Why, Kennedy, what on earth have you been doing to yourself? This is what comes of gallivanting about after dark. When we came round, yesterday evening, to go out with you as usual, you were not in. There was nothing very unusual in that, for these evening walks of yours are often prolonged; but we called again, on our return at eleven o\u0027clock, and found you were still absent. This looked serious. We came round again at six this morning, for we were anxious about you, and learned you had not been in all night, and, on enquiring, heard that Callaghan was also absent. \"That was cheering. That you might get into some scrape or other, we could reasonably believe; but, as you had your man with you, we could hardly suppose that misfortune had fallen upon both of you.\" \"The wound is a mere graze. I will tell you, after parade, what I have been doing,\" Desmond said, \"but you must nurse your curiosity till you are dismissed.\" A few minutes after Desmond reached his quarters, the surgeon came in. \"I do not think that I have any need of your services, doctor. I got a piece of plaster, and stuck it on two hours ago, and I have no doubt that the wound will heal in a few days.\" \"However, I will, with your permission, take it off, Mr. Kennedy. It is much better that the wound should be properly washed, and some dressing applied to it. It will heal all the quicker, and you are less likely to have an ugly scar. \"It is a pretty deep graze,\" he said, after he had carefully removed the plaster. \"An eighth of an inch farther, and it would have made your teeth rattle. You had better keep quiet, today. Tomorrow morning, if there is no sign of inflammation, I will take off the dressing and bandage and put on a plaster--one a third of the size that I took off will be sufficient; and as I will use a pink plaster, it will not be very noticeable, if you go outside the barracks. \"Where is your man? The colonel told me there were two patients. \"A nasty cut,\" he said, after examining Mike\u0027s wound. \"It is lucky that it was not a little higher. If it had been, you would have bled to death in five minutes. As it is, it is not serious. You will have to keep your arm in a sling for a fortnight. You are not to attend parade, or mount a horse, until I give you leave.\" On the ride from Versailles, Desmond had warned Mike to say no word as to the events of the night. \"I do not know what course the young lady\u0027s father may take,\" he said, \"and until I do, the matter had better be kept a secret, altogether.\" \"I will keep a quiet tongue in my head, and no one shall hear anything, from me, as to how I got this slice on my shoulder. I will just say that it was a bit of a scrimmage I got into, with two or three of the street rascals; and the thing is so common that no one is likely to ask any further questions about it.\" After the parade was over, O\u0027Neil and O\u0027Sullivan came up to Desmond\u0027s quarters. \"Now, Master Kennedy, we have come to receive your confession. We gave you credit for being a quiet, decent boy, and now it seems that you and that man of yours have been engaged in some disreputable riot, out all night, and coming in on two strange horses, which, for aught we know, have been carried off by force of arms.\" Desmond laughed. \"As to the horses, you are not so far wrong as one might expect, O\u0027Neil. We rode them this morning from Versailles.\" \"From Versailles!\" O\u0027Neil repeated. \"And what, in the name of all the saints, took you to Versailles! I am afraid, Desmond, that you are falling into very evil courses. \"Well, tell us all about it. I shall be glad to be able to believe that there is some redeeming feature in this strange business.\" Desmond laughed, and then said, more seriously, \"Well, I have had an adventure. Other people were concerned in it, as well as myself. I have made up my mind to tell you both, because I know that I can depend upon your promises to keep it an absolute secret.\" \"This sounds mysterious indeed,\" O\u0027Sullivan said. \"However, you have our promises. O\u0027Neil and I will be as silent as the grave.\" \"Well, then, you know how you were chaffing me, the other day, about finding Mademoiselle Pointdexter?\" \"You don\u0027t mean to say that you have found her, Kennedy?\" O\u0027Neil exclaimed incredulously. \"That is what I mean to say, though found is hardly the word, since I was not looking for her, or even thinking of her, at the time. Still, in point of fact, I accidentally came across the place where she was hidden away, and after a sharp skirmish, in which Callaghan and I each had to kill two men, we carried her off, and delivered her safely to her father this morning.\" The two young officers looked hard at Desmond, to discover if he was speaking seriously, for his tone was so quiet, and matter of fact, that they could scarce credit that he had passed through such an exciting adventure; and the three were so accustomed to hoax each other, that it struck them both as simply an invention on the part of their comrade, so absolutely improbable did it seem to them. \"Sure you are trying to hoax us, Kennedy,\" O\u0027Sullivan said. \"You could not blame me, if I were,\" Desmond said, with a smile, \"considering the cock-and-bull stories that you are constantly trying to palm off on me. However, you are wrong now. I will tell you the affair, just as it happened.\" And he related, in detail, the story of the rescue of Mademoiselle Pointdexter, and the manner in which he had conveyed her to Versailles. \"By Saint Bridget, Kennedy, we were not far wrong when we called you a knight errant. Well, this is something like an adventure, though whether it will end well or ill for you I cannot say. Did you learn the name of the person who had the girl carried off?\" \"No. I asked no questions, and indeed had but little conversation with her; for, as I have told you, I put her in a carriage, with the old hag who was in charge of her, and rode myself by the side of it, in case the old woman should try to escape.\" \"A truly discreet proceeding, Kennedy,\" O\u0027Neil laughed. \"I think, if I myself had been in your place, I should have taken a seat inside also, where you, of course, could at once have watched the old woman, and talked with the young one.\" \"I don\u0027t think that you would have done anything of the sort, O\u0027Neil,\" Desmond said gravely, \"but would have seen, as I did, that it was better that she should travel alone, with the old woman, till she reached her father\u0027s house. Scandal will be busy enough with her name, in any case, and it is as well that it should not be said that she arrived home, in a carriage, with a young officer of O\u0027Brien\u0027s Irish regiment.\" \"By my faith, Kennedy, it seems to me that you are a Saint Anthony and a Bayard rolled into one. But, seriously, you are undoubtedly right. Well, it all depends upon who was the man who carried her off, as to whether you were fortunate or unfortunate in thus having thwarted his designs. If he is some adventurer, your action will gain you heaps of credit. If, on the other hand, it was one of the king\u0027s favourites, seeking to mend his fortunes by marrying, it is probable that you will have made a dangerous enemy--nay, more, have drawn upon yourself the king\u0027s displeasure. I should think it likely that, before attempting so desperate an action as the carrying off of the Baron Pointdexter\u0027s daughter, such a man would have assured himself that the king would not view the enterprise with displeasure. \"We may assume that he would not inform His Majesty of any particulars, but would put it, hypothetically, that as he was getting into sore straits, he thought of mending his fortunes by carrying off an heiress--not, of course, one of those of whose hands the king had the disposal; and that he trusted that, if he succeeded, His Majesty would not view the matter as a grave offence. From what I know of Louis, he would reply gravely: \u0027I should be obliged (duke or viscount, as the case might be) to express very grave displeasure, and to order you to leave the court for a time; but, as the harm would be done, and the young lady married to you, it might be that, in time, I should pardon the offence.\u0027 \"If this is how things have gone, you may be sure that the king will not view, with satisfaction, the man who has interfered with his favourite\u0027s plan for mending his fortunes.\" Desmond shrugged his shoulders. \"The king\u0027s dissatisfaction would matter very little to me,\" he said, \"especially as he could not openly manifest it, without making it apparent that he had approved of the scheme.\" \"It is not such a trifle as you think, Kennedy. Lettres de cachet are not difficult to obtain, by powerful members of the court; especially when the person named is a young regimental officer, whose disappearance would excite no comment or curiosity, save among the officers of his own regiment. The man who carried off Mademoiselle Pointdexter must be a bold fellow, and is likely to be a vindictive one. No doubt, his object was to keep the young lady a prisoner, until she agreed to marry him, and the loss of a pretty bride with a splendid fortune is no trifling one, and likely to be bitterly resented. Whether that resentment will take the form of obtaining an order for your confinement in the Bastille, or other royal prison, or of getting you put out of the way by a stab in the back, I am unable to say, but in any case, I should advise you strongly to give up your fancy for wandering about after dark; and when you do go out, keep in the frequented portions of the town. \"Jack Farquharson, who was at Versailles with the colonel last week, was speaking of Mademoiselle Pointdexter, and said that she was charming. Did you find her so?\" \"I thought nothing about it, one way or the other,\" Desmond said, carelessly. \"I only saw her face by torchlight, and she was, of course, agitated by what had happened; and indeed, as I was busy helping Mike to yoke the horses to the carriage, I had scarcely time to look at her. When we reached Versailles it was barely daylight. I handed her out of the carriage, and left her to enter by herself, as I thought it was better that she should meet her father alone. I do not think that I should recognize her, were I to meet her in the street.\" \"Most insensible youth!\" O\u0027Sullivan said, with a laugh; \"insensible and discreet to a point that, were it not assured, none would believe that you had Irish blood in your veins. And so, you say you are going over to Versailles tomorrow?\" \"Yes. I left a message with the servant who opened the door, to that effect. Of course, I shall be glad to know if the baron intends to take any steps against his daughter\u0027s abductor, or whether he thinks it best not to add to the scandal by stirring up matters, but to take her away at once to his estates.\" \"He is in a difficult position,\" O\u0027Neil said gravely. \"The young lady has been missing for a fortnight. No one knows whether she went of her own free will, or against it. Were her father to carry her off, quietly, it would excite the worst suspicions. Better by far lodge his complaint before the king, proclaim his grievances loudly everywhere, and tell the story in all its details. Whichever course he takes, evil-minded people will think the worse; but of the two evils, the latter seems to me to be the lesser.\" \"I suppose it would be,\" Desmond agreed, \"though, for my part, I should be heartily glad if I never heard another word about it.\" \"You are too modest altogether, Kennedy. Whatever rumours may be current, concerning the young lady, there can be no doubt that you come out splendidly, in that you hear a cry of a woman in distress; you scale walls to get in to her assistance; you and your servant encounter five of her guards, kill four of them and bind the other; rescue the maiden, and carry her off, with flying colours, in the carriage of her abductor. My dear Kennedy, you will become an object of admiration to all the ladies of the court.\" \"That will be absolutely disgusting,\" Desmond said, angrily. \"It is almost enough to make one wish that one had never interfered in the affair.\" \"Pooh, pooh, Kennedy! I am sure that either O\u0027Sullivan or myself would give, I was going to say a year\u0027s pay, though how one would exist without it I don\u0027t know, to have been in your place. Why, man, if you had captured a standard in battle, after feats of superhuman bravery, you would not attract half the attention that will fall to you as a consequence of this adventure. Life in the court of His Most Christian Majesty is one of the most artificial possible. The women hide their faces with powder and patches, lace themselves until they are ready to faint, walk with a mincing air, and live chiefly upon scandal; but they are women, after all, and every woman has a spice of romance in her nature, and such an adventure as yours is the very thing to excite their admiration.\" \"I know nothing about women,\" Desmond growled, \"and don\u0027t want to know any of them, especially the ladies at the court of Louis.\" \"Well, of course, Kennedy, if the baron proclaims his wrongs, and publishes the circumstances of his daughter\u0027s abduction and rescue, the seal of silence will be taken from our lips; especially as you will, almost to a certainty, be summoned to Versailles to confirm the lady\u0027s story.\" \"I am afraid that that will be so,\" Desmond said, despondingly. \"However, it can\u0027t be helped, and I suppose one must make the best of it.\" To most of the officers who dropped in, in the course of the day, to see Desmond and to enquire how he got his wound, he abstained from giving any particulars. It was merely said that he and Callaghan were suddenly attacked, by five ruffians, whom they managed to beat off. Much surprise was expressed that such attack should be made upon an officer and a soldier, on whom little plunder could be expected, and who would be sure to defend themselves stoutly. Several, indeed, expressed some incredulity. \"We do not doubt for a moment, Kennedy, that you were attacked by five men, as you say, and that you routed them, but there must have been some motive for the attack. These evening strolls of yours are suspicious, and I will warrant that there must have been a great deal at the bottom of it. Now, can you deny that?\" \"I neither admit nor deny anything,\" Desmond said, with a smile; \"enough that, at present, I have told you all that I feel justified in telling. I acknowledge that there is more behind it, but at present my mouth is sealed on the subject.\" The colonel was among those who came in to see him. To him, Desmond said frankly that the affair was altogether out of the common, that it was likely that the whole facts would be known shortly, but that, as other persons were concerned, he could not speak of it until he had obtained their permission. \"Then I will ask no further,\" Colonel O\u0027Brien said. \"I have seen enough of you to know that you would not be concerned in any affair that could bring discredit upon the corps. I am curious to know the whole story, but am quite content to wait until you feel at liberty to tell me.\" The next morning, Desmond took part in the usual work of the regiment, and then, mounting his horse, rode to Versailles. On his ringing the bell at the house occupied by the Baron de Pointdexter, the old servitor, whom he had before seen, opened the gate. \"The baron is expecting you, monsieur,\" he said, bowing deeply; and, at his call, another servant ran out and took Desmond\u0027s horse, and led it away to the stable, while Desmond followed the old man to the house. The door opened as they approached, and the baron, a tall man, some fifty years of age, advanced hastily, holding out both hands. \"Monsieur Kennedy,\" he said, \"you have rendered to me the greatest service that I have received during my life. No words can express the gratitude that I feel, for one who has restored to me my only child, just when I had come to believe that she was lost to me forever. It was surely her guardian saint who sent you to the spot, at that moment.\" \"It might have happened to anyone, sir,\" Desmond said; \"surely any gentleman, on hearing an appeal for help from a woman in distress, would have done just what I did.\" \"Let us go in,\" the baron said. \"My daughter has been eagerly waiting your coming, especially as she tells me that she does not think she said even a word of thanks to you, being overpowered by what she had gone through, and by her joy at her sudden and unexpected deliverance. Indeed, she says that she scarcely exchanged two words with you.\" \"There was no opportunity, Baron, for indeed, as soon as she told me that there was a carriage and horses in the stable, I was too much occupied in getting it ready for her to depart without delay, to think of talking.\" They had now entered the house, and, as the baron led the way into the sitting room, the girl rose from a fauteuil. \"This, Monsieur Kennedy, is my daughter, Mademoiselle Anne de Pointdexter. It is high time that you were formally presented to each other. \"This, Anne, is the officer who rendered you such invaluable service.\" \"We meet almost as strangers, mademoiselle,\" Desmond said, deeply bowing, \"for I own that I saw so little of your face, the other night, that I should hardly have recognized you, had I met you elsewhere.\" \"I should certainly not have recognized you, Monsieur Kennedy. What with my own fright, and, I may say, the condition of your face, I had but a faint idea of what you were really like; but I certainly did not think that you were so young. You had such a masterful way with you, and seemed to know so perfectly what ought to be done, that I took you to be much older than you now look.\" \"I joined the regiment but little more than three months ago,\" Desmond said, \"and am its youngest ensign.\" \"Monsieur, I owe to you more than my life, for, had it not been for you, I should have been forced into marriage with one whom I despise.\" \"I cannot think that, mademoiselle. From what I saw of you, I should say that you would have resisted all threats, and even undergone hopeless imprisonment, rather than yield.\" \"There is no saying, Monsieur Kennedy,\" the baron said. \"Anne is of good blood, and I know that it would have been hard to break down her will, but confinement and hopelessness will tell on the bravest spirit. However that may be, she and I are your debtors for life.\" \"Indeed, Monsieur Kennedy,\" the girl said, \"I pray you to believe that I am more grateful to you than words can express.\" \"I pray you to say no more about it, mademoiselle. I deem it a most fortunate circumstance, that I was able to come to your assistance, and especially so, when I found that the lady I had rescued was one whose disappearance had made so great a stir; but I should have been glad to render such service to one in the poorest condition.\" \"My daughter said that you asked her no questions, Monsieur Kennedy, and you therefore are, I suppose, in ignorance of the name of her abductor?\" \"Altogether.\" \"It was the Vicomte de Tulle, one who stands very high in the regard of the king, and who is one of the most extravagant and dissipated, even of the courtiers here. For some time, it has been reported that he had nigh ruined himself by his lavish expenditure, and doubtless he thought to reestablish his finances by this bold stroke. \"His plans were well laid. He waited until I had gone to Paris on business that would keep me there for a day or two. A messenger arrived with a letter, purporting to be from me, saying that I wished my daughter to join me at once, and had sent a carriage to take her to me. Anne is young, and, suspecting no harm, at once threw on a mantle and hood, and entered the carriage. It was broad daylight, and there was nothing to disquiet her until, on approaching the town, the carriage turned off the main road. This struck her as strange, and she was just about to ask the question where she was being taken, when the carriage stopped in a lonely spot, the door was opened, and a man stepped in. \"Before she had even time to recognize him, he threw a thick cloak over her head. She struggled in vain to free herself, but he held her fast. Again and again, she tried to cry out, but her mouth was muffled by the wrapping. She had heard the blinds of the carriage drawn, and finding that her struggles to free herself were vain, and receiving no answer to her supplications to be released, she remained quiet until the carriage stopped. Then she was lifted out, and carried into the house where you found her. \"The wrapping was removed, and the man who had taken it off, and, who by his attire, was a gentleman in the service of some noble, said, \u0027Do not be alarmed, mademoiselle. No harm is intended to you. My master is grieved to be obliged to adopt such means, but his passion for you is so great that he was driven to this step, and it will entirely depend upon yourself when your captivity will end.\u0027 \"\u0027Your master, whoever he may be,\u0027 Anne said, \u0027is a contemptible villain.\u0027 \"\u0027Naturally, you have a poor opinion of him at present,\u0027 the fellow said; \u0027but I am convinced that, in time, you will come to excuse his fault. It is wholly due to the depth of the feeling that he entertains towards you. There is a woman here who will wait upon you. I and my men will not intrude. Our duty is solely to see that you do not escape, which indeed would be an impossibility for you, seeing that the wall that surrounds the garden is well-nigh fifteen feet high, and the gate barred and locked, and the key thereof in my pocket.\u0027 \"He called, and the old woman whom you brought here with Anne entered, and bid her ascend to the room that had been prepared for her. \"In that respect, she had nothing to complain of. Of course, you did not notice it, as you had other things to think of, but it was handsomely furnished. There was a bed in an alcove, some flowers on the table, some books, and even a harpsichord--evidently it was intended that her imprisonment should be made as light as might be. \"Looking from the window, Anne saw that the room was at the back of the house, and had probably been chosen because some trees shut the window off from view of anyone beyond the wall. The next day, the old woman announced the Vicomte de Tulle. He bowed profoundly, and began by excusing the step that he had taken, and crediting it solely to the passion that he had conceived for her. You may imagine the scorn and reproaches with which she answered him. He was quite unmoved by her words. \"\u0027Mademoiselle,\u0027 he said calmly, when she paused, \u0027you may be sure that I should not have undertaken this scheme, unless I had fully weighed the consequences. My plans have been so laid that whatever search may be made for you will be in vain. Here you are, and here you will remain until you listen to my suit. Every want shall be satisfied, and every wish complied with; but, whether it is one year or five, you will not leave this house until you leave it as my bride.\u0027 \"\u0027Then, sir,\u0027 she said passionately, \u0027I shall be a prisoner for life.\u0027 \"\u0027So you may think, at present, mademoiselle,\u0027 he said. \u0027And I expected nothing else. But, with time and reflection, you may come to think otherwise. union with me is not so terrible a matter. My rank you know, and standing high, as I do, in the favour of His Most Gracious Majesty, your position at court will be such as might gratify the daughter of the noblest family in France. The study of my life will be to make you happy. \"\u0027I shall now leave you to think over the matter. I shall not pester you with my attentions, and for another month you will not see me again. At the end of that time, I trust that you will have seen the futility of condemning yourself to further captivity, and will be disposed to make more allowance, than at present, for the step to which my passion for yourself has driven me.\u0027 \"It was just a month since she had been carried off, and, the very day when you rescued her, the old woman had informed her that the vicomte would do himself the pleasure of calling upon her the next day. For the first fortnight she had held up bravely, in the hope that I should discover the place where she had been hidden. Then she began to feel the imprisonment and silence telling upon her, for the old woman only entered to bring in her meals, and never opened her lips, except on the first occasion, when she told her that she was strictly forbidden to converse with her. After that she began to despair, and the news that her abductor would visit her, the next day, decided her to make an attempt to escape. She had no difficulty in letting herself down from the window by the aid of her bedclothes, but she found that what had been said respecting the wall and gate was true, and that she was no nearer escape than she had been, before she had left her room. She was trying, in vain, to unbar the gate, which, indeed, would have been useless could she have accomplished it, as it was also locked. But she was striving, with the energy of desperation, when the door of the house opened, and the men rushed out and seized her. As they dragged her back to the house, she uttered the cries that brought you to her assistance. The rest you know. \"As soon as I heard her story, I went to the palace and asked for a private interview with the king. The king received me graciously enough, and asked, with an appearance of great interest, if I had obtained any news of my daughter. \"\u0027I have more than obtained news, Your Majesty. I have my daughter back again, and I have come to demand justice at your hands.\u0027 \"\u0027I congratulate you, indeed, Baron,\u0027 the king said, with an appearance of warmth, but I saw his colour change, and was convinced that he knew something, at least, of the matter. \"\u0027And where has the damsel been hiding herself?\u0027 he went on. \"\u0027She has not been hiding herself, at all, Sire,\u0027 I said. \u0027She has been abducted, by one of Your Majesty\u0027s courtiers, with the intention of forcing her into a marriage. His name, Sire, is the Vicomte de Tulle, and I demand that justice shall be done me, and that he shall receive the punishment due to so gross an outrage.\u0027 \"The king was silent for a minute, and then said: \"\u0027He has, indeed, if you have been rightly informed, acted most grossly. Still, it is evident that he repented the step that he took, and so suffered her to return to you.\u0027 \"\u0027Not so, Your Majesty,\u0027 I said. \u0027I owe her return to no repentance on his part, but to the gallantry of a young officer who, passing the house where she was confined, heard her cries for aid, and, with his soldier servant, climbed the gate of the enclosure, and was there attacked by the man who had charge of her, with four others. The young gentleman and his servant killed four of them, and bound the other; and then, entering the house, compelled the woman who had been appointed to act as her servant to lead the way to her chamber. Fortunately, the carriage in which she had been taken there was still in the stables, with its horses. The gallant young gentleman at once got the carriage in readiness, placed my daughter in it, with the woman who had been attending on her. The servant drove, and he rode by the side of the carriage, and in that way brought her home this morning.\u0027 \"In spite of his efforts to appear indifferent, it was evident that the king was greatly annoyed. However, he only said: \"\u0027You did quite right to come to me, Baron. It is outrageous, indeed, that a young lady of my court should be thus carried off, and I will see that justice is done. And who is this officer, who has rendered your daughter such a service?\u0027 \"\u0027His name is Kennedy, Sire. He is an ensign in O\u0027Brien\u0027s Irish regiment.\u0027 \"\u0027I will myself send for him,\u0027 he said, \u0027and thank him for having defeated this disgraceful plot of the Vicomte de Tulle. I suppose you are quite sure of all the circumstances, as you have told them to me?\u0027 \"\u0027It is impossible that there can be any mistake, Sire,\u0027 I said. \u0027In the first place, I have my daughter\u0027s account. This is entirely corroborated by the old woman she had brought with her, and whose only hope of escaping from punishment lay in telling the truth. In every respect, she fully confirmed my daughter\u0027s account.\u0027 \"\u0027But the vicomte has not been absent from Versailles, for the past month. He has been at my morning levee, and on all other occasions at my breakfasts and dinners. He has walked with me in the gardens, and been always present at the evening receptions.\u0027 \"\u0027That is so, Sire,\u0027 I said. \u0027My daughter, happily, saw him but once; namely, on the morning after she was captured. He then told her, frankly, that she would remain a prisoner until she consented to marry him, however long the time might be. He said he would return in a month, and hoped by that time to find that, seeing the hopelessness of her position, she would be more inclined to accept his suit. \"\u0027It was on the eve of his coming again that my daughter, in her desperation, made the attempt to escape. She was foiled in her effort, but this, nevertheless, brought about her rescue, for her cries, as her guards dragged her into the house, attracted the attention of Monsieur Kennedy, who forthwith, as I have told you, stormed the house, killed her guards, and brought her home to me.\u0027 \"The king then sent for de Tulle, and spoke to him with great sternness. The latter did not attempt to deny my accusation, but endeavoured to excuse himself, on the ground of the passion that he had conceived for my daughter. Certainly, from the king\u0027s tone, I thought that he would at least have sent him to the Bastille; but, to my great disappointment, he wound up his reproof by saying: \"\u0027I can, of course, make some allowances for your passion for so charming a young lady as Mademoiselle Pointdexter, but the outrage you committed is far too serious to be pardoned. You will at once repair to your estates, and will remain there during my pleasure.\u0027 \"The vicomte bowed and withdrew, and, an hour later, left Versailles. The king turned to me, as he left the room, and said, \u0027I trust, Monsieur le Baron, that you are content that justice has been done.\u0027 \"I was too angry to choose my words, and I said firmly, \u0027I cannot say that I am content, Your Majesty. Such an outrage as that which has been perpetrated upon my daughter deserves a far heavier punishment than banishment from court; and methinks that an imprisonment, as long as that which he intended to inflict upon her unless she consented to be his wife, would have much more nearly met the justice of the case.\u0027 \"The king rose to his feet suddenly, and I thought that my boldness would meet with the punishment that I desired for de Tulle; but he bit his lips, and then said coldly: \"\u0027You are not often at court, Baron Pointdexter, and are doubtless ignorant that I am not accustomed to be spoken to, in the tone that you have used. However, I can make due allowance for the great anxiety that you have suffered, at your daughter\u0027s disappearance. I trust that I shall see you and your daughter at my levee, this evening.\u0027 \"As this was a command, of course we went, and I am bound to say that the king did all in his power to show to his court that he considered her to be wholly blameless. Of course, the story had already got about, and it was known that the vicomte had been ordered to his estates. The king was markedly civil to Anne, talked to her for some time, expressed his deep regret that she should have been subject to such an outrage, while staying at his court, and said, in a tone loud enough to be heard by all standing round: \"\u0027The only redeeming point in the matter is, that the Vicomte de Tulle in no way troubled or molested you, and that you only saw him, for a few minutes, on the first day of your confinement.\u0027 \"I need not say that this royal utterance was most valuable to my daughter, and that it at once silenced any malicious scandal that might otherwise have got about. \"The king stopped to speak to me, immediately afterwards, and I said: \"\u0027I trust that you will pardon the words I spoke this morning. Your Majesty has rendered me and my daughter an inestimable service, by the speech that you have just made.\u0027 \"Thus, although dissatisfied with the punishment inflicted on the Vicomte de Tulle, and believing that the king had a shrewd idea who her abductor was, I am grateful to him for shielding my daughter from ill tongues, by his marked kindness to her, and by declaring openly that de Tulle had not seen her, since the day of her abduction. I intended to return home tomorrow, but the king himself, when I went this morning to pay my respects, and state my intention of taking Anne home, bade those standing round to fall back, and was good enough to say in a low voice to me: \"\u0027I think, Baron, that you would do well to reconsider your decision to leave tomorrow. Your sudden departure would give rise to ill-natured talk. It would be wiser to stay here, for a short time, till the gossip and wonder have passed away.\u0027 \"I saw that His Majesty was right, and shall stay here for a short time longer. It would certainly have a bad effect, were we to seem to run away and hide ourselves in the provinces.\" Mademoiselle de Pointdexter had retired when her father began to relate to Desmond what had happened. \"I know little of life in Paris, Monsieur le Baron,\" Desmond said, \"but it certainly seems to me monstrous, that the man who committed this foul outrage should escape with what is, doubtless, but a short banishment from court.\" \"I do not know that the matter is ended yet, Monsieur Kennedy. In spite of the edicts against duelling, I myself should have demanded satisfaction from him, for this attack upon the honour of my family, but I am at present Anne\u0027s only protector. It is many years since I have drawn a sword, while de Tulle is noted as a fencer, and has had many affairs, of which he has escaped the consequences owing to royal favour. Therefore, were I to challenge him, the chances are that I should be killed, in which case my daughter would become a ward of the crown, and her hand and estate be bestowed on one of the king\u0027s creatures. But, as I said, the matter is not likely to rest as it is. \"Anne has, with my full consent and approval, given her love to a young gentleman of our province. He is a large-landed proprietor, and a connection of our family. They are not, as yet, formally betrothed, for I have no wish to lose her so soon; and, in spite of the present fashion of early marriages, I by no means approve of them, and told Monsieur de la Vallee that they must wait for another couple of years. \"I need scarcely say that, after what has happened, I shall reconsider my decision; for the sooner she is married, and beyond the reach of a repetition of this outrage, the better. I imagine, however, that the young gentleman will be no better satisfied than I am, that the matter should have been passed over so lightly; and will take it into his own hands, and send a challenge immediately to the vicomte. He is high spirited, and has the reputation among us of being a good fencer, but I doubt whether he can possess such skill as that which de Tulle has acquired. It is not always the injured person that comes off victorious in a duel; and, should fortune go against Monsieur de la Vallee, it would be a terrible blow to my daughter, and indeed to myself, for I am much attached to him. She is worrying about it, already. \"Of course, it is impossible that the affair can be hidden from him. It is public property now; and therefore, I sent off one of my grooms, an hour since, with a letter to him. \"Hitherto, I had not written to him about my daughter\u0027s disappearance. Knowing he would, on hearing of it, at once hasten here, where he could do no good and would only add to my trouble, I thought it best to let matters go on as they were. I had been doing everything that was possible, and to have his troubles as well as my own on my hands would have driven me to distraction. \"The groom is to change horses at every post house, and to use the greatest possible speed. You may be sure that Monsieur de la Vallee will do the same, and that in six days he will be here. I have given him the merest outline of the affair, and have not mentioned the name of Anne\u0027s abductor. Had I done so, it is probable that Philip would have gone straight to de Tulle, and forced on an encounter at once. As it is, I trust that Anne and I, between us, may persuade him to take no step in the matter. It is the honour of my family, not of his, that has been attacked. Had he been betrothed to my daughter, he would have been in a position to take up her quarrel. As it is, he has no status, except distant relationship. \"And now, Monsieur Kennedy, I have the king\u0027s order to take you to the palace. He asked me several questions about you this morning. I said that I had not yet seen you, but that you were riding over here today, and he said: \"\u0027Bring him to me when he comes, Baron. I should like to see this young fire eater, who thrust himself so boldly into a matter in which he had no concern, solely because he heard a woman\u0027s voice calling for help.\u0027\" \"I am sorry to hear it,\" Desmond said, bluntly. \"From what you say I imagine that, in spite of what he has done, the king is far from gratified at the failure of his favourite\u0027s plan. However, I cannot disobey his commands in the matter.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3119/85809.html","bookId":905,"book":{"id":905,"title":"In the Irish Brigade","description":"简介： The evils arising from religious persecution, sectarian hatred, ill government, and oppression were never more strongly illustrated than by the fact that, for a century, Ireland, which has since that time furnished us with a large proportion of our b...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3119","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:50 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:50 AM"}}
