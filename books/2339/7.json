{"id":65506,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"\"SO WHAT SHOULD I DO?\" HUBBLE ASKED ME. \"WHAT would you do?\" He was staring over at me. Waiting for a reply. What would I do? If somebody threatened me like that, they would die. I\u0027d rip them apart. Either as they spoke, or days or months or years later. I would hunt them down and rip them apart. But Hubble couldn\u0027t do that. He had a family. Three hostages waiting to be taken. Three hostages already taken. Taken as soon as the threat was made. \"What should I do?\" he asked me again. I felt pressure. I had to say something. And my forehead hurt. It was bruising up after the massive impact with the Red Boy\u0027s face. I stepped to the bars and glanced down the row of cells. Leaned against the end of the bunk. Thought for a moment. Came up with the only possible answer. But not the answer Hubble wanted to hear. \"Nothing you can do,\" I said. \"You\u0027ve been told to keep your mouth shut, so you keep it shut. Don\u0027t tell anybody what\u0027s going on. Ever.\" He looked down at his feet. Dropped his head into his hands. Gave a moan of abject misery. Like he was crushed with disappointment. \"I\u0027ve got to talk to somebody,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve got to get out of this. I mean it, I\u0027ve got to get out. I\u0027ve got to talk to somebody.\" I shook my head at him. \"You can\u0027t do that,\" I said. \"They\u0027ve told you to say nothing, so you say nothing. That way you stay alive. You and your family.\" He looked up. Shuddered. \"Something very big is going on,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve got to stop it if I can.\" I shook my head again. If something very big was going on around people who used threats like that, then he was never going to stop it. He was on board, and he was going to stay on board. I smiled a bleak smile at him and shook my head for the third time. He nodded like he understood. Like he finally accepted the situation. He went back to rocking and staring at the wall. His eyes were open. Red and naked without the gold rims. He sat silently for a long time. I COULDN\u0027T UNDERSTAND THE CONFESSION. HE SHOULD have kept his mouth shut. He should have denied any involvement with the dead guy. Should have said he had no idea why his phone number was written down in the guy\u0027s shoe. Should have said he had no idea what Pluribus was. Then he could have just gone home. \"Hubble?\" I said. \"Why did you confess?\" He looked up. Waited a long moment before replying. \"I can\u0027t answer that,\" he said. \"I\u0027d be telling you more than I should.\" \"I already know more than I should,\" I said. \"Finlay asked about the dead guy and Pluribus and you flipped. So I know there\u0027s a link between you and the dead guy and whatever Pluribus is.\" He gazed at me. Looking vague. \"Is Finlay that black detective?\" he said. \"Yes,\" I said. \"Finlay. Chief of detectives.\" \"He\u0027s new,\" Hubble said. \"Never seen him before. It was always Gray. He was there years, since I was a kid. There\u0027s only one detective, you know, don\u0027t know why they say chief of detectives when there\u0027s only one. There\u0027s only eight people in the whole police department. Chief Morrison, he\u0027s been there years, then the desk man, four uniformed men, a woman, and the detective, Gray. Only now it\u0027s Finlay. The new man. Black guy, the first we\u0027ve ever had. Gray killed himself, you know. Hung himself from a rafter in his garage. February, I think.\" I let him ramble on. Prison conversation. It passes the time. That\u0027s what it\u0027s for. Hubble was good at it. But I still wanted him to answer my question. My forehead hurt and I wanted to bathe it with cold water. I wanted to walk around for a while. I wanted to eat. I wanted coffee. I waited without listening as Hubble rambled through the municipal history of Margrave. Suddenly he stopped. \"What were you asking me?\" he said. \"Why did you confess to killing the guy?\" I repeated. He looked around. Then he looked straight at me. \"There\u0027s a link,\" he said. \"That\u0027s all it\u0027s safe to say right now. The detective mentioned the guy, and used the word \u0027Pluribus,\u0027 which made me jump. I was startled. I couldn\u0027t believe he knew the connection. Then I realized he hadn\u0027t known there was a connection, but I\u0027d just told him by being startled. You see? I\u0027d given it away. I felt I\u0027d blown it. Given away the secret. And I mustn\u0027t do that, because of the threat.\" He tailed off and went quiet. An echo of the fright and panic he had felt in Finlay\u0027s office was back. He looked up again. Took a deep breath. \"I was terrified,\" he said. \"But then the detective told me the guy was dead. He\u0027d been shot. I got scared because if they had killed him, they might kill me, too. I can\u0027t really tell you why. But there\u0027s a link, like you worked out. If they got that particular guy, does that mean they are going to get me too? Or doesn\u0027t it? I had to think it out. I didn\u0027t even know for sure who had killed the guy. But then the detective told me about the violence. Did he tell you about that?\" I nodded. \"The injuries?\" I said. \"Sounded pretty unpleasant.\" \"Right,\" Hubble said. \"And it proves it was who I thought it was. So I was really scared. I was thinking, are they looking for me too? Or aren\u0027t they? I just didn\u0027t know. I was terrified. I thought for ages. It was going around and around in my head. The detective was going crazy. I didn\u0027t say anything because I was thinking. Seemed like hours. I was terrified, you know?\" He fell back into silence. He was running it through his head again. Probably for the thousandth time. Trying to figure out if his decision had been the right one. \"I suddenly figured out what to do,\" he said. \"I had three problems. If they were after me too, I had to avoid them. Hide, you know? To protect myself. But if they weren\u0027t after me, then I had to stay silent, right? To protect my wife and kids. And from their point of view that particular guy needed shooting. Three problems. So I confessed.\" I didn\u0027t follow his reasoning. Didn\u0027t make much sense, the way he was explaining it to me. I looked blankly at him. \"Three separate problems, right?\" he said. \"I decided to get arrested. Then I was safe if they were after me. Because they can\u0027t get at me in here, right? They\u0027re out there and I\u0027m in here. That\u0027s problem number one solved. But I also figured, this is the complicated bit, if they actually were not after me at all, then why don\u0027t I get arrested but don\u0027t say anything about them? They would think I had got arrested by mistake or whatever, and they see that I\u0027m not talking. They see, OK? It proves I\u0027m safe. It\u0027s like a demonstration that I\u0027m dependable. A sort of proof. Trial by ordeal sort of a thing. That\u0027s problem number two solved. And by saying it was me actually killed the guy, it sort of definitely puts me on their side. It\u0027s like a statement of loyalty, right? And I thought they might be grateful I\u0027d pointed the heat in the wrong direction for a while. So that was problem number three solved.\" I stared at him. No wonder he had clammed up and thought like crazy for forty minutes when he was in with Finlay. Three birds with one stone. That\u0027s what he had been aiming for. The part about proving he could be trusted not to spill his guts was OK. Whoever they were, they would notice that. A spell in jail without talking was a rite of passage. A badge of honor. Counted for a lot. Good thinking, Hubble. Unfortunately the other part was pretty shaky. They couldn\u0027t get to him in here? He had to be joking. No better place in the world to ace a guy than prison. You know where he is, you\u0027ve got all the time you need. Lots of people who\u0027ll do it for you. Lots of opportunity. Cheap, too. On the street, a hit would cost you what? A grand, two grand? Plus a risk. Inside, it costs you a carton of cigarettes. Plus no risk. Because nobody would notice. No, prison was not a safe hiding place. Bad thinking, Hubble. And there was another flaw, too. \"What are you going to do on Monday?\" I asked him. \"You\u0027ll be back home, doing whatever you do. You\u0027ll be walking around Margrave or Atlanta or wherever it is you walk around. If they\u0027re after you, won\u0027t they get you then?\" He started up with the thinking again. Going at it like crazy. He hadn\u0027t thought very far ahead before. Yesterday afternoon it had been blind panic. Deal with the present. Not a bad principle. Except pretty soon the future rolls in and that needs dealing with, too. \"I\u0027m just hoping for the best,\" Hubble said. \"I sort of felt if they wanted to get me, they might cool off after a while. I\u0027m very useful to them. I hope they\u0027ll think about that. Right now it\u0027s a very tense situation. But it\u0027s all going to calm back down very soon. I might just make it through. If they get me, they get me. I don\u0027t care anymore. It\u0027s my family I\u0027m worried about.\" He stopped and shrugged. Blew a sigh. Not a bad guy. He hadn\u0027t set out to be some big criminal. It had crept up on the blind side. Sucked him in so gently he hadn\u0027t noticed. Until he wanted out. If he was very lucky they wouldn\u0027t break all his bones until after he was dead. \"How much does your wife know?\" I asked him. He glanced over. An expression of horror on his face. \"Nothing,\" he said. \"Nothing at all. I haven\u0027t told her anything. Not a thing. I couldn\u0027t. It\u0027s all my secret. Nobody else knows a thing.\" \"You\u0027ll have to tell her something,\" I said. \"She\u0027s sure to have noticed you\u0027re not at home, vacuuming the pool or whatever you do on the weekend.\" I was just trying to lighten it up, but it didn\u0027t work out. Hubble went quiet. Misting over again at the thought of his backyard in the early fall sunlight. His wife maybe fussing over rosebushes or whatever. His kids darting about shrieking. Maybe they had a dog. And a three-car garage with European sedans waiting to be hosed off. A basketball hoop over the middle door waiting for the nine-year-old to grow strong enough to dunk the heavy ball. A flag over the porch. Early leaves waiting to be swept. Family life on a Saturday. But not this Saturday. Not for this guy. \"Maybe she\u0027ll think it\u0027s all a mistake,\" he said. \"Maybe they\u0027ve told her, I don\u0027t know. We know one of the policemen, Dwight Stevenson. My brother married his wife\u0027s sister. I don\u0027t know what he\u0027ll have said to her. I guess I\u0027ll deal with that on Monday. I\u0027ll say it was some kind of terrible mistake. She\u0027ll believe it. Everybody knows mistakes are made.\" He was thinking out loud. \"Hubble?\" I said. \"What did the tall guy do to them that was liable to get himself shot in the head?\" He stood up and leaned on the wall. Rested his foot on the edge of the steel toilet pan. Looked at me. Wouldn\u0027t answer. Now for the big question. \"What about you?\" I asked him. \"What have you done to them liable to get yourself shot in the head?\" He wouldn\u0027t answer. The silence in our cell was terrible. I let it crash around for a while. Couldn\u0027t think of anything more to say. Hubble clunked his shoe against the metal toilet pan. A rattly little rhythm. Sounded like a Bo Diddley riff. \"You ever heard of Blind Blake?\" I asked him. He stopped clunking and looked up. \"Who?\" he said blankly. \"Doesn\u0027t matter,\" I said. \"I\u0027m going to find a bathroom. I need to put a wet towel on my head. It hurts.\" \"I\u0027m not surprised,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll come with you.\" He was anxious not to be left alone. Understandable. I was going to be his minder for the weekend. Not that I had any other plans. WE WALKED DOWN THE CELL ROW TO A KIND OF OPEN AREA at the end. I saw the fire door Spivey had used the night before. Beyond it was a tiled opening. Over the opening was a clock. Nearly twelve noon. Clocks in prisons are bizarre. Why measure hours and minutes when people think in years and decades? The tiled entrance was clogged with men. I pushed through and Hubble followed. It was a large tiled room, square. A strong disinfectant stink. One wall had the doorway. On the left was a row of shower stalls. Open. The back wall was a row of toilet cubicles. Open at the front, divided by waist-high partitions. The right wall was a row of washbasins. Very communal. Not a big deal if you\u0027d been in the army all your life, but Hubble wasn\u0027t happy. Not what he was used to at all. All the fittings were steel. Everything that would normally be porcelain was stainless-steel. For safety. A smashed-up porcelain washbasin yields some pretty good shards. A decent-sized sharp piece would make a good weapon. For the same reason the mirrors over the basins were sheets of polished steel. A bit dull, but fit for the purpose. You could see yourself in them, but you couldn\u0027t smash them up and stab somebody with a fragment. I stepped over to a basin and ran cold water. Took a wad of paper towels from the dispenser and soaked them. Held them to my bruised forehead. Hubble stood around doing nothing. I kept the cold towels on for a while and then took some more. Water ran down my face. Felt good. There was no real injury. No flesh there, just skin over solid bone. Not much to injure, and impossible to break. A perfect arch, nature\u0027s strongest structure. That\u0027s why I avoid hitting anything with my hands. Hands are pretty fragile. All kinds of small bones and tendons in there. A punch big enough to deck that Red Boy would have smashed my hand up pretty good. I\u0027d have joined him in the hospital. Not much point in that. I patted my face dry and leaned up close to the steel mirror to check out the damage. Not bad. I combed my hair with my fingers. As I leaned against the sink I could feel the sunglasses in my pocket. The Red Boy\u0027s shades. The spoils of victory. I took them out and put them on. Gazed at my dull reflection. As I messed about in front of the steel mirror I saw the start of some kind of a commotion happening behind me. I heard a brief warning from Hubble and I turned around. The sunglasses dimmed the bright light. Five white guys were trawling across the room. Biker types. Orange suits, of course, more torn-off sleeves, but with black leather additions. Caps, belts, fingerless gloves. Big beards. All five were big, heavy men, with that hard, slabby fat which is almost muscle but not quite. All five had crude tattoos on their arms and their faces. Swastikas. On their cheeks under their eyes and on their foreheads. The Aryan Brotherhood. White trash prison gang. As the five swept the room, the other occupants melted away. Any who didn\u0027t get the message were seized and hustled to the door. Thrown out into the corridor. Even the soapy naked guys from the shower stalls. Within seconds the big bathroom was empty. Except for the five bikers and Hubble and me. The five big men fanned out in a loose arc around us. These were big ugly guys. The swastika tattoos on their faces were scratched in. Roughly inked. My assumption was they\u0027d come to recruit me. Somehow hijack the fact that I\u0027d knocked over a Red Boy. Claim my bizarre celebrity for their cause. Turn it into a race triumph for the Brotherhood. But I was wrong. My assumption was way out. So I was left unprepared. The guy in the middle of the five was looking back and forth between Hubble and me. His eyes flicked across. They stopped on me. \"OK, he\u0027s the one,\" he said. Looking straight at me. Two things happened. The end two bikers grabbed Hubble and ran him to the door. And the boss man swung a big fist at my face. I saw it late. Dodged left and it caught me on the shoulder. I was spun around by the blow. Grabbed from behind by the neck. Two huge hands at my throat. Strangling me. The boss man lined up for another shot at my gut. If it landed, I was a dead man. I knew that much. So I leaned back and kicked out. Smashed the boss man\u0027s balls like I was trying to punt a football right out of the stadium. The big Oxford shoe crunched him real good. The welt hit him like a blunt ax. My shoulders were hunched and I was pumping up my neck to resist the strangler. He was wrenching hard. I was losing it. I reached up and broke his little fingers. I heard the knuckles splinter over the roaring in my ears. Then I broke his ring fingers. More splintering. Like pulling a chicken apart. He let go. The third guy waded in. He was a solid mountain of lard. Sheathed with heavy slabs of meat. Like armor. Nowhere to hit him. He was pounding me with short jabs to the arm and chest. I was jammed back between two sinks. The mountain of lard pressing up. Nowhere to hit him. Except his eyes. I jammed my thumb into his eye. Hooked the tips of my fingers in his ear and squeezed. My thumbnail popped his eyeball sideways. I pushed my thumb in. His eyeball was nearly out. He was screaming and pulling on my wrist. I held on. The boss man was up on one knee. I kicked hard at his face. Missed. Caught him in the throat instead. Smashed his voice box. He went back down. I went for the big guy\u0027s other eye. Missed. I held on with my thumb. Like pushing it through a bloody steak. He went down. I spun away from the wall. The guy with the broken fingers ran for the door. The guy with the eye out was flopping about on the floor. Screaming. The boss man was choking on his smashed voice box. I was grabbed from behind again. I twisted away. A Red Boy. Two of them. I was dizzy. I was going to lose it now. But they just grabbed me and ran me to the door. Sirens were going off. \"Get out of here, man,\" screamed the Red Boys over the sirens. \"This is ours. We did this. Understand? Red Boys did this. We\u0027ll take the fall, man.\" They hurled me into the crowd outside. I understood. They were going to say they did it. Not because they wanted to protect me from the blame. Because they wanted to claim the credit. A race victory. I saw Hubble bouncing around in the crowd. I saw guards. I saw hundreds of men. I saw Spivey. I grabbed Hubble and we hustled back to the cell. Sirens were blasting. Guards were tumbling out of a door. I could see shotguns and clubs. Boots clattered. Shouting and screaming. Sirens. We raced to the cell. Fell inside. I was dizzy and panting. I had taken a battering. The sirens were deafening. Couldn\u0027t talk. I splashed water on my face. The sunglasses were gone. Must have fallen off. I heard screaming at the door. I turned and saw Spivey. He was screaming at us to get out. He rushed into the cell. I grabbed my coat from the bunk. Spivey seized Hubble by the elbow. Then he grabbed me and straight-armed both of us out of there. He was screaming at us to run. Sirens were blasting. He ran us to the emergency door where the guards had rushed out. Shoved us through and ran us upstairs. Up and up. My lungs were giving out. There was a door at the top of the last flight painted with a big figure six. We crashed through. He hustled us down a row of cells. Shoved us into an empty cell and flung the iron gate shut. It crashed and locked. He ran off. I collapsed on the bed, eyes tight shut. WHEN I OPENED THEM AGAIN HUBBLE WAS SITTING ON A bed looking over at me. We were in a big cell. Probably twice as wide as the last one. Two separate beds, one on each side. A sink, a john. A wall of bars. Everything was brighter and cleaner. It was very quiet. The air smelled better. This was the holding floor. This was floor six. This was where we should have been all the time. \"What the hell happened to you in there?\" Hubble asked. I just shrugged at him. A meal cart appeared outside our cell. It was dragged by an old white guy. Not a guard, some kind of an orderly. Looked more like an old steward on an ocean liner. He passed a tray through an oblong slot in the bars. Covered plates, paper cups, Thermos. We ate the food sitting on our beds. I drank all the coffee. Then I paced the cell. Shook the gate. It was locked. The sixth floor was calm and quiet. A big clean cell. Separate beds. A mirror. Towels. I felt much better up here. Hubble piled the meal debris on the tray and shoved it out under the gate into the corridor. He lay down on his bed. Put his hands behind his head. Stared at the ceiling. Doing time. I did the same. But I was thinking hard. Because they had definitely gone through a selection process. They had looked us both over very carefully and chosen me. Quite definitely chosen me. Then they had tried to strangle me. They would have killed me. Except for one thing. The guy with his hands around my throat had made a mistake. He had me from behind, which was in his favor, and he was big enough and strong enough. But he hadn\u0027t balled up his fingers. The best way is to use the thumbs on the back of the neck but fold up the fingers. Do it with knuckle pressure, not finger pressure. The guy had left his fingers out straight. So I had been able to reach up and snap them off. His mistake had saved my life. No doubt about that. Soon as he was neutralized, it was two against one. And I\u0027d never had a problem with those kind of odds. But it was still a straightforward attempt to kill me. They came in, chose me, tried to kill me. And Spivey had just happened to be outside the bathroom. He had set it up. He had employed the Aryan Brotherhood to kill me. He had ordered the attack and waited ready to burst in and find me dead. And he had planned it yesterday before ten in the evening. That was clear. That\u0027s why he had left us on the wrong floor. On the third, not the sixth. On a convict floor, not the holding floor. Everybody had known we should have been on the holding floor. The two guards last night in the reception bunker, they had been totally clear about it. It had said so on their battered clipboard. But at ten o\u0027clock, Spivey had left us on the third floor where he knew he could have me killed. He\u0027d told the Aryans to attack me at twelve o\u0027clock the next day. He had been waiting outside that bathroom at twelve o\u0027clock ready to burst in. Ready to see my body lying on the tiles. But then his plan had fouled up. I wasn\u0027t killed. The Aryans were beaten off. The Red Boys had piled in to seize the moment. Mayhem had broken out. A riot was starting. Spivey was panicking. He hit the alarms and called the crash squads. Rushed us off the floor, up to the sixth, and left us up here. According to all the paperwork, the sixth floor is where we\u0027d been all the time. A neat fallback. It made me fireproof as far as investigation went. Spivey had chosen the fallback option which said we were never there. He had a couple of serious injuries on his hands, probably even a dead guy. I figured the boss man must have choked to death. Spivey must know I had done it. But he could never say so now. Because according to him, I was never there. I lay on the bed and stared at the concrete ceiling. I exhaled gently. The plan was clear. No doubt about Spivey\u0027s plan at all. The fallback was coherent. An aborted plan with a neat fallback position. But why? I didn\u0027t understand it. Let\u0027s say the strangler had balled up his fingers. They would have got me then. I would have been dead. Dumped on the bathroom floor with my big swollen tongue sticking out. Spivey would have rushed in and found me. Why? What was Spivey\u0027s angle? What did he have against me? I\u0027d never seen him before. Never been anywhere near him or his damn prison. Why the hell should he operate an elaborate plan to get me dead? I couldn\u0027t begin to figure it out.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/killing-floor-jack-reacher-1/page-7.html","bookId":2339,"book":{"id":2339,"title":"Killing Floor (Jack Reacher #1)","description":"Storyline: Due to some reason, the article content has been deleted.
