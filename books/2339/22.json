{"id":65521,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"FINLAY NODDED. HE WAS CONVINCED. THEN HE SMILED. HE stood up from the bench in the barbershop window and took Roscoe\u0027s hand. Shook it very formally. \"Good work,\" he said to her. \"A perfect analysis. I always said you were smart, Roscoe. Right, Reacher? Didn\u0027t I tell you she\u0027s the best we got?\" I nodded and smiled and Roscoe blushed. Finlay held on to her hand and kept on smiling. But I could see him combing backward and forward through her theory, looking for loose ends. He only found two. \"What about Hubble?\" he asked. \"Where did he fit in? They wouldn\u0027t recruit a bank executive just to load trucks, would they?\" I shook my head. \"Hubble used to be a currency manager,\" I said. \"He was there to get rid of the fake money. He was feeding it into the system. He knew where it could be slipped in. Where it was needed. Like his old job, but in reverse.\" He nodded. \"What about the air conditioners?\" he asked. \"Sherman Stoller was hauling them to Florida. That woman told you. We know that\u0027s for real because you saw two old cartons in her garage. And his truck was full of them when the Jacksonville PD searched it. What was that all about?\" \"Legitimate business, I guess,\" I said. \"Like a decoy. It concealed the illegal part. Like camouflage. It explained the truck movements up and down to Florida. They would have had to run south empty otherwise.\" Finlay nodded. \"Smart move, I guess,\" he said. \"No empty run. Makes sense. Sell a few air conditioners, it makes money both ways, right?\" He nodded again and let go of Roscoe\u0027s hand. \"We need samples of the money,\" he said. I smiled at him. I had suddenly realized something. \"I\u0027ve got samples,\" I said. I put my hand in my pocket and pulled out my thick roll of hundreds. Pulled one off the back of the roll and one off the front. Gave the two banknotes to Finlay. \"These are their counterfeits?\" he said. \"Got to be,\" I said. \"Charlie Hubble gave me a wad of hundreds for expense money. She probably got them from Hubble. Then I took another wad from those guys who were out looking for me Tuesday.\" \"And that means they\u0027re counterfeit?\" Finlay said. \"Why?\" \"Think about it,\" I said. \"Kliner needs operating cash, why should he use real money? I bet he paid Hubble in counterfeit money. And I bet he gave those Jacksonville boys counterfeit money for their operating expenses, too.\" Finlay held the two hundreds right up to the bright light in the window. Roscoe and I crowded him for a look. \"Are you sure?\" Roscoe said. \"They look real to me.\" \"They\u0027re fakes,\" I said. \"Got to be. Stands to reason, right? Hundreds are what fakers like to print. Anything bigger is hard to pass, anything smaller isn\u0027t worth the effort. And why should they spend real bucks when they\u0027ve got truckloads of forgeries available?\" We took a good look at them. Peered at them, felt them, smelled them, rubbed them between our fingers. Finlay opened up his billfold and pulled out a hundred of his own. We compared the three notes. Passed them back and forth. Couldn\u0027t see any difference at all. \"If these are fakes, they\u0027re damn good,\" Finlay said. \"But what you said makes sense. Probably the whole of the Kliner Foundation is funded with fakes. Millions every year.\" He put his own hundred back in his billfold. Slid the fakes into his pocket. \"I\u0027m going back to the station house,\" he said. \"You two come in tomorrow, about noon. Teale will be gone for lunch. We\u0027ll take it from there.\" ROSCOE AND I DROVE FIFTY MILES SOUTH, TO MACON. I wanted to keep on the move. It\u0027s a basic rule for safety. Keep moving around. We chose an anonymous motel on the southeastern fringe. As far from Margrave as you can get in Macon, with the city sprawl between us and our enemies. Old Mayor Teale had said a motel in Macon would suit me. Tonight, he was right. We showered in cold water and fell into bed. Fell into a restless sleep. The room was warm. We tossed around fitfully most of the night. Gave it up and got up again with the dawn. Stood there yawning in the half light. Thursday morning. Felt like we hadn\u0027t slept at all. We groped around and got dressed in the dark. Roscoe put her uniform on. I put my old things on. I figured I\u0027d need to buy some new stuff soon. I\u0027d do it with Kliner\u0027s forgeries. \"What are we going to do?\" Roscoe said. I didn\u0027t answer. I was thinking about something else. \"Reacher?\" she said. \"What are we going to do about all this?\" \"What did Gray do about it?\" I said. \"He hung himself,\" she said. I thought some more. \"Did he?\" I asked her. There was a silence. \"Oh God,\" Roscoe said. \"You think there\u0027s some doubt about that?\" \"Maybe,\" I said. \"Think about it. Suppose he confronted one of them? Suppose he was found poking around somewhere he shouldn\u0027t have been?\" \"You think they killed him?\" she asked. There was panic in her voice. \"Maybe,\" I said again. \"I think they killed Joe and Stoller and the Morrisons and Hubble and Molly Beth Gordon. I think they tried to kill you and me. If somebody is a threat, they kill him. That\u0027s how Kliner operates.\" Roscoe was quiet for a while. Thinking about her old colleague. Gray, the dour and patient detective. Twenty-five years of meticulous work. A guy like that was a threat. A guy who took thirty-two patient days to cross-check a suspicion was a threat. Roscoe looked up and nodded. \"He must have made a wrong move,\" she said. I nodded gently at her. \"They lynched him,\" I said. \"Made it look like suicide.\" \"I can\u0027t believe it,\" she said. \"Was there an autopsy?\" I asked her. \"Guess so,\" she said. \"Then we\u0027ll check it out,\" I said. \"We\u0027ll have to speak to that doctor again. Down in Yellow Springs.\" \"But he\u0027d have said, right?\" she asked me. \"If he\u0027d had doubts, wouldn\u0027t he have raised them at the time?\" \"He\u0027d have raised them with Morrison,\" I said. \"Morrison would have ignored them. Because his people had caused them in the first place. We\u0027ll have to check it out for ourselves.\" Roscoe shuddered. \"I was at his funeral,\" she said. \"We were all there. Chief Morrison made a speech on the lawn outside the church. So did Mayor Teale. They said he was a fine officer. They said he was Margrave\u0027s finest. But they killed him.\" She said it with a lot of feeling. She\u0027d liked Margrave. Her family had toiled there for generations. She was rooted. She\u0027d liked her job. Enjoyed the sense of contribution. But the community she\u0027d served was rotten. It was dirty and corrupted. It wasn\u0027t a community. It was a swamp, wallowing in dirty money and blood. I sat and watched her world crumble. WE DROVE NORTH ON THE ROAD BETWEEN MACON AND MARGRAVE. Halfway home Roscoe hung a right and we headed for Yellow Springs down a back road. Over toward the hospital. I was hungry. We hadn\u0027t eaten breakfast. Not the best state for revisiting the morgue. We swung into the hospital lot. Took the speed bumps slowly and nosed around to the back. Parked up a little way from the big metal roller door. We got out of the car. Stretched our legs on a roundabout route to the office door. The sun was warming the day up. It would have been pleasant to stay outside. But we ducked in and went looking for the doctor. We found him in his shabby office. He was at his chipped desk. Still looking tired. Still in a white coat. He looked up and nodded us in. \"Morning, folks,\" he said. \"What can I do for you?\" We sat down on the same stools as Tuesday. I stayed away from the fax machine. I let Roscoe do the talking. Better that way. I had no official standing. \"February this year,\" she said. \"My chief of detectives up at the Margrave PD killed himself. Do you remember?\" \"Was that some guy called Gray?\" the doctor said. Roscoe nodded and the doctor got up and walked around to a file cabinet. Pulled open a drawer. It was tight and made a screeching sound. The doctor ran his fingers backward over the files. \"February,\" he said. \"Gray.\" He pulled a file and carried it back to his desk. Dropped it on his blotter. Sat back down heavily and opened it up. It was a thin file. Not much in it. \"Gray,\" he said again. \"Yes, I remember this guy. Hung himself, right? First time we had a Margrave case in thirty years. I was called up to his house. In the garage, wasn\u0027t it? From a rafter?\" \"That\u0027s right,\" Roscoe said. She went quiet. \"So how can I help you?\" the doctor said. \"Anything wrong with it?\" she asked. The doctor looked at the file. Turned a page. \"Guy hangs himself, there\u0027s always something wrong with it,\" he said. \"Anything specially wrong with it?\" I said. The doctor swung his tired gaze over from Roscoe to me. \"Suspicious?\" he said. He was nearly smiling the same little smile he\u0027d used on Tuesday. \"Was there anything suspicious about it?\" I asked him. He shook his head. \"No,\" he said. \"Suicide by hanging. Open and shut. He was on a kitchen stool in his garage. Made himself a noose, jumped off the stool. Everything was consistent. We got the background story from the local people up there. I couldn\u0027t see a problem.\" \"What was the background story?\" Roscoe asked him. He swung his gaze back to her. Glanced through the file. \"He was depressed,\" he said. \"Had been for a while. The night it happened he was out drinking with his chief, who was the Morrison guy we just had in here, and the town mayor up there, some guy called Teale. The three of them were drowning their sorrows over some case Gray had screwed up on. He got falling down drunk and they had to help him home. They got him in to his house and left him there. He must have felt bad. He made it to the garage and hung himself.\" \"That was the story?\" Roscoe said. \"Morrison signed a statement,\" the doctor said. \"He was real upset. Felt he should have done more, you know, stayed with him or something.\" \"Did it sound right to you?\" she asked him. \"I didn\u0027t know Gray at all,\" he said. \"This facility deals with a dozen police departments. I\u0027d never seen anybody from Margrave before then. Quiet sort of a place, right? At least, it used to be. But what happened with this guy is consistent with what usually happens. Drinking sets people off.\" \"Any physical evidence?\" I asked him. The doctor looked back in the file. Looked over at me. \"Corpse stank of whiskey,\" he said. \"Some fresh bruising on the upper and lower arms. Consistent with him being walked home by two men while inebriated. I couldn\u0027t see a problem.\" \"Did you do a postmortem?\" Roscoe asked him. The doctor shook his head. \"No need,\" he said. \"It was open and shut, we were very busy. Like I say, we have more to worry about down here than suicides over in Margrave. February, we had cases all over the place. Up to our eyes. Your Chief Morrison asked for minimum fuss. I think he sent us a note. Said it was kind of sensitive. Didn\u0027t want Gray\u0027s family to know that the old guy had been blind drunk. Wanted to preserve some kind of dignity. It was OK with me. I couldn\u0027t see a problem and we were very busy, so I released the body for cremation right away.\" Roscoe and I sat looking at each other. The doctor stepped back to the cabinet and put the file away. Closed the drawer with a screech. \"OK, folks?\" he said. \"If you\u0027ll excuse me, I\u0027ve got things to do.\" We nodded and thanked him for his time. Then we shuffled out of the cramped office. Got back out into the warm fall sunshine. Stood around blinking. We didn\u0027t speak. Roscoe was too upset. She\u0027d just heard about her old friend getting murdered. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" I said. \"A bullshit story from beginning to end,\" she said. \"He hadn\u0027t just screwed up on a case. He never screwed up on any case. He wasn\u0027t especially depressed. And he didn\u0027t drink. Never touched a drop. So he certainly wasn\u0027t falling down drunk. And he would never socialize with Morrison. Or the damn mayor. He just wouldn\u0027t. He didn\u0027t like them. Never in a million years would he spend a social evening with them. And he had no family. So all that stuff about his family and sensitivity and dignity is total bullshit. They killed him and bullshitted the coroner so he wouldn\u0027t look too closely.\" I sat there in the car and let the rage pour out of her. Then she was quiet and still. She was figuring out how they\u0027d done it. \"Do you think it was Morrison and Teale?\" she asked me. \"And somebody else,\" I said. \"There were three guys involved. I figure the three of them went around to his place and knocked on the door. Gray opened up and Teale pulled a gun. Morrison and the third guy grabbed him and held him by the arms. That explains the bruising. Teale maybe poured a bottle of whiskey down his throat, or at least splashed it all over his clothes. They hustled him off to the garage and strung him up.\" Roscoe started the car and eased it out of the hospital lot. She drove slowly over the speed bumps. Then she swung the wheel and blasted up the road through the countryside toward Margrave. \"They killed him,\" she said. Just a simple statement. \"Like they killed Joe. I think I know how you must be feeling.\" I nodded. \"They\u0027ll pay for it,\" I said. \"For both of them.\" \"You bet your ass,\" she said. We fell silent. Sped north for a while, then merged with the county road. A straight twelve miles up to Margrave. \"Poor old Gray,\" she said. \"I can\u0027t believe it. He was so smart, so cautious.\" \"Not smart enough,\" I said. \"Or cautious enough. We\u0027ve got to remember that. You know the rules, right? Don\u0027t be on your own. If you see somebody coming, run like hell. Or shoot the bastard. Stick with Finlay if you can, OK?\" She was concentrating on driving. She was doing a hell of a speed up the straight road. Thinking about Finlay. \"Finlay,\" she repeated. \"You know what I can\u0027t figure?\" \"What?\" I said. \"There\u0027s the two of them, right?\" she said. \"Teale and Morrison. They run the town for Kliner. They run the police department. Between them, they run everything. Their chief of detectives is Gray. An old guy, a wise head, smart and stubborn. He\u0027s been there for twenty-five years, since well before any of this shit started up. They inherited him and they can\u0027t get rid of him. So sure enough, one day their smart and stubborn detective sniffs them out. He\u0027s found out that something is going on. And they find out that he\u0027s found out. So they put him out of the way. They murder him to keep it all safe. Then what do they do next?\" \"Go on,\" I said. \"They hire in a replacement,\" she said. \"Finlay, down from Boston. A guy who is even smarter and even more stubborn than Gray was. Why the hell would they do that? If Gray was a danger to them, then Finlay would be twice as dangerous. So why did they do that? Why did they hire somebody even smarter than the last guy?\" \"That\u0027s easy,\" I said. \"They thought Finlay was really dumb.\" \"Dumb?\" she said. \"How the hell could they think that?\" So I told her the story Finlay had told me on Monday over donuts at the convenience store counter. About his divorce. About his mental state at the time. What had he said? He was a basket case. An idiot. Couldn\u0027t string two words together. \"Chief Morrison and Mayor Teale interviewed him,\" I told her. \"He thought it was the worst job application in history. He thought he had come across as an idiot. He was totally amazed they gave him the job. Now I understand why they did. They really were looking for an idiot.\" Roscoe laughed. That made me feel better. \"God,\" she said. \"That\u0027s ironic. They must have sat down and planned it out. Gray was a problem, they said. Better replace him with a fool, they said. Better pick the worst candidate who applies, they said.\" \"Right,\" I said. \"And they did. They picked a shell-shocked idiot from Boston. But by the time he turns up to start work, he\u0027s calmed down and turned back into the cool and intelligent guy he always was.\" She smiled about that for two miles. Then we crested a slight rise and began the long sweep down into Margrave. We were tensed up. It was like entering the battle zone. We\u0027d been out of it for a while. Sweeping back into it didn\u0027t feel good. I had expected to feel better when I had identified the opposing players. But it wasn\u0027t what I had expected. It wasn\u0027t me against them, played out against a neutral background. The background wasn\u0027t neutral. The background was the opposition. The whole town was in it. The whole place was bought and paid for. Nobody would be neutral. We were barreling down the rise at seventy miles an hour toward a dangerous mess. More dangerous than I had expected. Roscoe slowed up at the town limit. The big Chevy glided onto Margrave\u0027s glassy blacktop. The magnolia and dogwood scrub to the left and right was replaced by velvet lawns and ornamental cherries. Those trees with smooth shiny trunks. Like the bark was buffed by hand. In Margrave, it probably was. The Kliner Foundation was probably paying somebody a handsome salary to do it. We passed the neat blocks of stores, all of them empty and complacent, floating on an unearned thousand a week. We jinked around the village green with the statue of Caspar Teale. Wafted past the turn down to Roscoe\u0027s house with its smashed front door. Past the convenience store. Past the benches under the smart awnings. Past the parkland where the bars and rooming houses had been, back when Margrave was honest. Then up to the station house. We pulled off into the lot and parked up. Charlie Hubble\u0027s Bentley was still there where I\u0027d left it. Roscoe killed the motor and we sat for a minute. Didn\u0027t want to get out. We squeezed hands, her right, my left. A brief good luck gesture. We got out of the car. Into battle. THE STATION HOUSE WAS COOL AND DESERTED EXCEPT FOR Baker at his desk and Finlay on his way out of the rosewood office in back. He saw us and hurried over. \"Teale\u0027s back in ten minutes,\" he said. \"And we got a slight problem.\" He hustled us back to the office. We went in and he shut the door. \"Picard called,\" he said. \"So what\u0027s the problem?\" I said. \"It\u0027s the safe house,\" he said. \"Where Charlie and the kids are hiding out? That situation has to stay unofficial, right?\" \"He told me that,\" I said. \"He\u0027s out on a limb up there.\" \"Exactly,\" he said. \"That\u0027s the problem. He can\u0027t staff it. He needs somebody to be up there with Charlie. He\u0027s been doing duty himself. But he can\u0027t do any more. Can\u0027t take any more time out. And he feels it\u0027s not appropriate, you know, Charlie being a woman, and the little girl and all. Kid\u0027s terrified of him.\" He looked over at Roscoe. She saw where the conversation was going. \"He wants me up there?\" she asked. \"Just for twenty-four hours,\" Finlay said. \"That\u0027s what he\u0027s asking for. Will you do it for him?\" Roscoe shrugged. Smiled. \"Of course I will,\" she said. \"No problem. I can spare a day. As long as you promise to get me back when the fun starts, OK?\" \"That\u0027s automatic,\" Finlay said. \"Fun can\u0027t start until we\u0027ve got the detail, and as soon as we\u0027ve got the detail, Picard goes official and he puts his own agents into the safe house. You come back here.\" \"OK,\" Roscoe said. \"When do I go?\" \"Right now,\" Finlay said. \"He\u0027ll be here any minute.\" She grinned at him. \"So you already figured I\u0027d agree to it?\" she said. He grinned back at her. \"Like I told Reacher,\" he said. \"You\u0027re the best we got.\" She and I went back through the squad room and out through the glass doors. Roscoe took her valise out of the Chevy and set it on the curb. \"See you tomorrow, I guess,\" she said. \"You going to be OK?\" I asked her. \"Sure,\" she said. \"I\u0027m going to be fine. Can\u0027t get much safer than an FBI safe house, right? But I\u0027m going to miss you, Reacher. I didn\u0027t figure to spend time apart just yet.\" I squeezed her hand. She kissed me on the cheek. Just stretched up for a quick peck. Finlay pushed the station house door open. I heard the suck of the rubber seal. He stuck his head out and called over to Roscoe. \"You better give Picard an update, OK?\" he said. Roscoe nodded to him. Then we stood waiting in the sun. Didn\u0027t have to wait long. Picard\u0027s blue sedan squealed into the lot within a couple of minutes. Bounced to a stop right next to us. The big guy folded himself out of the seat and stood up. Just about blotted out the sun. \"I appreciate this, Roscoe,\" he said to her. \"You\u0027re really helping me out.\" \"No problem,\" she said. \"You\u0027re helping us out, right? Where is this place I\u0027m going?\" Picard grinned a harassed grin. Nodded toward me. \"I can\u0027t say where it is,\" he told her. \"Not in front of civilians, right? I\u0027m way out of line already. And I\u0027m going to have to ask you not to tell him afterward, OK? And Reacher, don\u0027t you press her about it, or Charlie, OK?\" \"OK,\" I said. I wouldn\u0027t press her about it. She\u0027d tell me anyway. \"Good,\" Picard said. He nodded a busy good-bye and picked up Roscoe\u0027s bag. Threw it onto his rear seat. Then the two of them got into the blue sedan and drove off. Nosed out of the lot and headed north. I waved after them. Then the car was lost to sight.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/killing-floor-jack-reacher-1/page-22.html","bookId":2339,"book":{"id":2339,"title":"Killing Floor (Jack Reacher #1)","description":"Storyline: Due to some reason, the article content has been deleted.

Not lately. But he doesn’t stand a chance of convincing anyone. Not in Margrave, Georgia. Not a chance in hell.

When authorities learn the first victim was someone from Reacher\u0027s past, and he cannot convince them of his innocence, his patient self-defense becomes a raging crusade of revenge.
