You\u0027ve been very helpful, both of you. Very considerate. You\u0027ve kept me in touch every step of the way. You\u0027ve given me the Hubbles, and you\u0027ve given me Officer Roscoe. I really couldn\u0027t have asked for anything more.\"\n Finlay was rooted to the spot. Shaking.\n \"You?\" he said again.\n \"Should have spotted it Wednesday, asshole,\" Picard said. \"I sent the little guy to Joe\u0027s hotel two hours before I told you about it. You disappointed me. I expected to be doing this scene way before now.\"\n He looked at us and smiled. Finlay turned away. Looked at me. I couldn\u0027t think of anything to say to him. I couldn\u0027t think about anything at all. I just looked at Picard\u0027s huge bulk in the doorway and had a strong feeling that this was going to be the last day of my life. Today, it would end.\n \"Get over there,\" Picard said to me. \"Next to Finlay.\"\n He had taken two giant strides into the room and he was pointing the gun straight at me. I noticed mechanically that it was a new.38 with a short barrel. I calculated automatically that it would be accurate over such a short distance. But that a.38 couldn\u0027t be relied on to put a target down. And there were two of us and one of him. And Finlay had a weapon in a shoulder holster under the tweed jacket. I spent a fraction of a second weighing up the odds. Then I abandoned the calculation because Mayor Teale stepped through the open door behind Picard. He had his heavy cane in his left hand. But in his right hand he was carrying a police-issue shotgun. It was an Ithaca Mag-10. Didn\u0027t really matter where he was pointing it.\n \"Get over there,\" Picard said to me again.\n \"Where\u0027s Roscoe?\" I said to him.\n He laughed at me. Just laughed and gestured with the gun barrel that I should stand up and move over next to Finlay. I heaved myself off the desk and stepped over. I felt like I was weighted down with lead. I clamped my lips and moved with the grim determination of a cripple trying to walk.\n I stood next to Finlay. Teale covered us with the giant scatter gun. Picard darted his hand up under Finlay\u0027s jacket. Took the revolver out of his holster. Slipped it into the pocket of his own enormous jacket. The jacket flapped open under the weight. It was the size of a tent. He stepped sideways and patted me down. I was unarmed. My jacket was outside in the Bentley\u0027s trunk. Then he stepped back and stood side by side with Teale. Finlay stared at Picard like his heart was breaking.\n \"What\u0027s this all about?\" Finlay said. \"We go back a long way, right?\"\n Picard just shrugged at him.\n \"I told you to stay away,\" he said. \"Back in March, I tried to stop you coming down here. I warned you off. That\u0027s true, right? But you wouldn\u0027t listen, would you, you stubborn asshole? So you get what you get, my friend.\"\n I listened to Picard\u0027s growl and felt worse for Finlay than I did for myself. But then Kliner stepped in through the door. His bone-hard face was cracked into a grin. His feral teeth glittered. His eyes bored into me. He was carrying another Ithaca Mag-10 in his left hand. In his right hand, he was carrying the gun that had killed Joe. It was pointed straight at me.\n It was a Ruger Mark II. A sneaky little.22-caliber automatic. Fitted with a fat silencer. It was a gun for a killer who enjoys getting close. I stared at it. Nine days ago, the end of that silencer had touched my brother\u0027s temple. There was no doubt about that. I could feel it.\n Picard and Teale moved around behind the desk. Teale sat in the chair. Picard towered over his shoulder. Kliner was gesturing Finlay and me to sit. He was using his shotgun barrel as a baton. Short jerky movements to move us around. We sat. We were side by side in front of the big rosewood desk. We stared straight at Teale. Kliner closed the office door and leaned on it. He held the shotgun one-handed, at his hip. Pointed at the side of my head. The silenced.22 was pointing at the floor.\n I looked hard at the three of them in turn. Old Teale was staring at me with all kinds of hate showing in his leathery old face. He was shaken up. He looked like a man under terrible stress. He looked desperate. Like he was near collapse. He looked twenty years older than the smooth old guy I\u0027d met on Monday. Picard looked better. He had the calm of a great athlete. Like a football star or an Olympic champion on a visit to his old high school. But there was a tightening around his eyes. And he was rattling his thumb against his thigh. There was some strain there.\n I stared sideways at Kliner. Looked hard at him. But there was nothing on show. He was lean and hard and dried out. He didn\u0027t move. He was absolutely still. His face and body betrayed nothing. He was like a statue hewn from teak. But his eyes burned with a kind of cruel energy. They sneered at me out of his blank, bone-hard face.\n Teale rattled open a drawer in the rosewood desk. Pulled out the cassette recorder Finlay had used on me. Handed it to Picard, behind him. Picard put his revolver down on the desk and fiddled with the stiff cords. He plugged in the power. Didn\u0027t bother with the microphone. They weren\u0027t going to record anything. They were going to play us something. Teale leaned forward and thumbed the intercom button on the desk. In the stillness, I heard the buzzer sound faintly outside in the squad room.\n \"Baker?\" Teale said. \"In here, please.\"\n Kliner moved off the door and Baker came in. He was in his uniform. A.38 in his holster. He looked at me. Didn\u0027t grin. He was carrying two cassettes. Teale took them from him. Selected the second one.\n \"A tape,\" he said. \"Listen up. You\u0027re going to find this interesting.\"\n He fiddled the cassette in and clicked the little door shut. Pressed play. The motor whirred and the speaker hissed. Underneath the hiss, I could hear a boomy acoustic. Then we heard Roscoe\u0027s voice. It was loud with panic. It filled the silent office.\n \"Reacher?\" Roscoe\u0027s voice said. \"This is a message for you, OK? The message is you better do what they tell you, or I\u0027m in trouble. The message is if you\u0027re in any doubt about what kind of trouble, you should go back down to the morgue and pull Mrs. Morrison\u0027s autopsy report. That\u0027s the kind of trouble I\u0027m going to be in. So help me out, OK? End of message, Reacher.\"\n Her voice tailed off into the boomy hiss. I heard a faint gasp of pain as if she\u0027d been roughly dragged away from the microphone. Then Teale snapped the recorder off. I stared at him. My temperature had dropped away to nothing. I didn\u0027t feel human anymore.\n Picard and Baker were looking at me. Beaming in satisfaction. Like they were holding the winning hole card. Teale clicked the little door open and took the tape out. Laid it on one side on the desk. Held up the other tape for me to see and then put it in the machine. Closed the little door again and pressed play.\n \"Another one,\" he said. \"Listen up.\"\n We heard the same hiss. The same boomy acoustic. Then we heard Charlie Hubble\u0027s voice. She sounded hysterical. Like she had on Monday morning, standing out on her bright gravel driveway.\n \"Hub?\" Charlie\u0027s voice said. \"This is Charlie. I\u0027ve got the children with me. I\u0027m not at home, you understand what that means? I\u0027ve got to give you a message. If you don\u0027t come back, something will happen to the children. They tell me you know what that something is. It\u0027s the same thing they said would happen to you and me, but it\u0027ll be the children instead. So you have to come back straightaway, OK?\"\n The voice ended on a rising note of panic and then died away in the boomy hiss. Teale stabbed the stop button. Took the tape out and placed it carefully on the edge of the desk. Right in front of me. Then Kliner walked around into my field of vision and spoke.\n \"You\u0027re going to take that with you,\" he said to me. \"You\u0027re going to take it to wherever you\u0027ve hidden Hubble and you\u0027re going to play it to him.\"\n Finlay and I looked at each other. Just stared at each other in blank astonishment. Then I snapped back and stared at Kliner.\n \"You killed Hubble already,\" I said.\n Kliner hesitated for a second.\n \"Don\u0027t try that shit,\" he said. \"We were going to, but you got him out of the way. You\u0027re hiding him. Charlie told us.\"\n \"Charlie told you?\" I said.\n \"We asked her where he was,\" he said. \"She promised us you\u0027d be able to find him. She was most insistent about it. We had a knife between her little girl\u0027s legs at the time. She became very anxious to convince us that her husband was not beyond our reach. She said you\u0027d given him all sorts of advice and guidance. She said you\u0027d given him all sorts of help. She said you\u0027d be able to find him. I hope for everybody\u0027s sake she wasn\u0027t lying.\"\n \"You killed him,\" I said again. \"I don\u0027t know anything about it.\"\n Kliner nodded and sighed. His voice was low.\n \"Let\u0027s cut the crap,\" he said. \"You\u0027re hiding him, and we need him back. We need him back right away. It\u0027s a matter of urgency to us. We\u0027ve got a business to run. So we\u0027ve got a number of options. We could beat it out of you. We discussed that. It\u0027s a tactical problem, right? But we figured you might send us off in the wrong direction, because time is tight right now. You might figure that was your best option, right?\"\n He waited for some kind of a comment from me. He didn\u0027t get one.\n \"So what we\u0027re going to do is this,\" he said. \"Picard is going to go with you to pick him up. When you get wherever he is, Picard is going to call me. On my mobile. He knows the number. Then you all three come on back here. OK?\"\n I didn\u0027t respond.\n \"Where is he?\" Kliner asked suddenly.\n I started to speak, but he held up his hand and stopped me.\n \"Like I told you, let\u0027s cut the crap,\" he said. \"For instance, you\u0027ve been sitting there thinking as hard as you can. No doubt you were trying to figure some way you might be able to take Picard out. But you won\u0027t be able to do that.\"\n I shrugged. Said nothing.\n \"Two problems,\" Kliner said. \"I doubt if you could take Picard out. I doubt if anybody could. Nobody ever has. And my mobile number isn\u0027t written down. It\u0027s in Picard\u0027s head.\"\n I shrugged again. Kliner was a smart guy. The worst sort.\n \"Let me add a couple of factors,\" he said. \"We don\u0027t know exactly how far away Hubble is. And you\u0027re not going to tell us the truth about that. So I\u0027ll tell you what we\u0027re going to do. We\u0027re going to give you a time limit.\"\n He stopped talking and walked around to where Finlay was sitting. He raised the.22 and put the tip of the silencer in Finlay\u0027s ear. Pushed it in hard until Finlay was tilting over in his chair.\n \"The detective here is going in a cell,\" he said. \"He\u0027s going to be handcuffed to the bars. If Picard hasn\u0027t called me by one hour before dawn tomorrow, I\u0027m going to aim my shotgun into the detective\u0027s cell and blow him apart. Then I\u0027m going to make the delightful Officer Roscoe clean his guts off the back wall with a sponge. Then I\u0027m going to give you another hour. If Picard hasn\u0027t called me by the time the sun comes up, I\u0027m going to start in on the delightful Officer Roscoe herself. She\u0027ll end up in a lot of pain, Reacher. But first there will be a great deal of sexual interference. A great deal. You have my word on that, Reacher. It\u0027ll be very messy. Very messy indeed. Mayor Teale and I have spent a pleasant hour discussing just exactly what we\u0027re going to do to her.\"\n Kliner was forcing Finlay practically out of the chair with the pressure of the automatic in his ear. Finlay\u0027s lips were clamped. Kliner was sneering at me. I smiled at him. Kliner was a dead man. He was as dead as a man who has just jumped off a high building. He hadn\u0027t hit the ground yet. But he\u0027d jumped.\n \"Understand?\" Kliner said to me. \"Call it six o\u0027clock tomorrow morning to save Mr. Finlay\u0027s life, seven o\u0027clock to save Miss Roscoe\u0027s life. And don\u0027t go messing with Picard. Nobody else knows my phone number.\"\n I shrugged at him again.\n \"Do you understand?\" he repeated.\n \"I think so,\" I said. \"Hubble\u0027s run away and you don\u0027t know how to find him, right? Is that what you\u0027re telling me?\"\n Nobody spoke.\n \"You can\u0027t find him, can you?\" I said. \"You\u0027re useless, Kliner. You\u0027re a useless piece of shit. You think you\u0027re some kind of a smart guy, but you can\u0027t find Hubble. You couldn\u0027t find your asshole if I gave you a mirror on a stick.\"\n I could hear that Finlay wasn\u0027t breathing. He thought I was playing with his life. But old man Kliner left him alone. Moved across into my field of vision again. He had gone pale. I could smell his stress. I was just about getting used to the idea that Hubble was still alive. He\u0027d been dead all week, and now he was alive again. He was alive, and hiding out somewhere. He\u0027d been hiding out somewhere all week, while they looked for him. He was on the run. He hadn\u0027t been dragged out of his house on Monday morning. He\u0027d walked out by himself. He\u0027d taken that stay-at-home call and smelled a rat and run for his life. And they couldn\u0027t find him. Paul Hubble had given me the tiny edge I was going to need.\n \"What\u0027s Hubble got that you want so much?\" I said.\n Kliner shrugged at me.\n \"He\u0027s the only loose end left,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve taken care of everything else. And I\u0027m not going out of business just because an asshole like Hubble is running around somewhere shooting his stupid mouth off. So I need him at home. Where he belongs. So you\u0027re going to get him for me.\"\n I leaned forward and stared right into his eyes.\n \"Can\u0027t your son get him for you?\" I said, quietly.\n Nobody spoke. I leaned forward some more.\n \"Tell your boy to go pick him up,\" I said.\n Kliner was silent.\n \"Where\u0027s your son, Kliner?\" I asked him.\n He didn\u0027t say anything.\n \"What happened to him?\" I said. \"Do you know?\"\n He knew, but he didn\u0027t know. I could see that. He hadn\u0027t accepted it. He\u0027d sent his boy after me, and his boy hadn\u0027t come back. So he knew, but he hadn\u0027t admitted it to himself. His hard face went slack. He wanted to know. But he couldn\u0027t ask me. He wanted to hate me for killing his boy. But he couldn\u0027t do that either. Because to do that would be to admit it was true.\n I stared at him. He wanted to raise that big shotgun and blow me into a red dew. But he couldn\u0027t. Because he needed me to get Hubble back. He was churning away inside. He wanted to shoot me right then. But forty tons of money was more important to him than his son\u0027s life.\n I stared into his dead eyes. Unblinking. Spoke softly.\n \"Where\u0027s your son, Kliner?\" I said.\n There was silence in the office for a long time.\n \"Get him out of here,\" Kliner said. \"If you\u0027re not out of here in one minute, Reacher, I\u0027ll shoot the detective right now.\"\n I stood up. Looked around the five of them. Nodded to Finlay. Headed out. Picard followed me and closed the door quietly. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/killing-floor-jack-reacher-1/page-29.html","bookId":2339,"book":{"id":2339,"title":"Killing Floor (Jack Reacher #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Due to some reason, the article content has been deleted.

He’s just passing through Margrave, Georgia, and in less than an hour, he’s arrested for murder. Not much of a welcome. All Reacher knows is that he didn’t kill anybody. At least not here. Not lately. But he doesn’t stand a chance of convincing anyone. Not in Margrave, Georgia. Not a chance in hell. \n The sleepy, forgotten town of Margrave, Georgia, hasn\u0027t seen a crime in decades, but within the span of three days it witnesses events that leave everyone stunned. An unidentified man is found beaten and shot to death on a lonely country road. The police chief and his wife are butchered on a quiet Sunday morning. Then a bank executive disappears from his home, leaving his keys on the table and his wife frozen with fear. The easiest suspect is Jack Reacher - an outsider, a man just passing through. But Reacher is a tough ex-military policeman, trained to think fast and act faster. When authorities learn the first victim was someone from Reacher\u0027s past, and he cannot convince them of his innocence, his patient self-defense becomes a raging crusade of revenge. With two cops who believe in him - a thoughtful black detective and a woman named Roscoe - he closes in on a ruthless conspiracy hiding behind Margrave\u0027s rural charm. But closing in on him is a team of killers. Step by step, the two teams circle - waiting to see which will be the first to walk onto the killing floor.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/killing-floor-jack-reacher-1.jpg","author":"Lee Child","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/killing-floor-jack-reacher-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:36 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:57:36 AM"}}
