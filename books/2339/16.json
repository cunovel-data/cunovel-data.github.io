{"id":65515,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"THEY HAD COME FOR US IN THE NIGHT. THEY HAD COME expecting a lot of blood. They had come with all their gear. Their rubber overshoes and their nylon bodysuits. Their knives, their hammer, their bag of nails. They had come to do a job on us, like they\u0027d done on Morrison and his wife.\\n\\n They had pushed open the forbidden door. They had made a second fatal mistake. Now they were dead men. I was going to hunt them down and smile at them as they died. Because to attack me was a second attack on Joe. He was no longer here to stand up for me. It was a second challenge. A second humiliation. This wasn\u0027t about self-defense. This was about honoring Joe\u0027s memory.\\n\\n Roscoe was following the trail of footprints. Showing a classic reaction. Denial. Four men had come to butcher her in the night. She knew that, but she was ignoring it. Closing it out of her mind. Dealing with it by not dealing with it. Not a bad approach, but she\u0027d fall off the high wire before long. Until then, she was making herself busy tracing the faint footprints on her floors.\\n\\n They had searched the house for us. They had split up in the bedroom and looked around. Then they had regrouped in the bedroom and left. We looked for tracks outside on the road, but there was nothing. The smooth tarmac was wet and steaming. We went back inside. No evidence at all except the wrenched lock and the faint footprints throughout the house.\\n\\n Neither of us spoke. I was burning with anger. Still watching Roscoe. Waiting for the dam to break. She\u0027d seen the Morrison corpses. I hadn\u0027t. Finlay had sketched in the details for me. That was bad enough. He\u0027d been there. He\u0027d been shaken by the whole thing. Roscoe had been there too. She\u0027d seen exactly what somebody wanted to do to the two of us.\\n\\n \"So who were they after?\" she said at last. \"Me, you, both of us?\"\\n\\n \"They were after both of us,\" I said. \"They figure Hubble talked to me in prison. They figure I\u0027ve told you all about it. So they think you and I know whatever it was Hubble knew.\"\\n\\n She nodded, vaguely. Then she moved away and leaned up near her back door. Looking out at her neat evergreen garden. I saw her go pale. She shuddered. The defenses crashed down. She pressed herself into the corner by the door. Tried to flatten herself onto the wall. Stared into space like she was seeing all the nameless horrors. Started crying like her heart was broken. I stepped over and held her tight. Pressed her against me and held her as she cried out the fear and the tension. She cried for a long time. She felt hot and weak. My shirt was soaked with her tears.\\n\\n \"Thank God we weren\u0027t here last night,\" she whispered.\\n\\n I knew I had to sound confident. Fear wouldn\u0027t get her anywhere. Fear would just sap her energy. She had to face it down. And she had to face down the dark and the quiet again tonight, and every other night of her life.\\n\\n \"I wish we had been here,\" I said. \"We could have gotten a few answers.\"\\n\\n She looked at me like I was crazy. Shook her head.\\n\\n \"What would you have done?\" she said. \"Killed four men?\"\\n\\n \"Only three,\" I said. \"The fourth would have given us the answers.\"\\n\\n I said it with total certainty. Total conviction. Like absolutely no other possibility existed. She looked at me. I wanted her to see this huge guy. A soldier for thirteen long years. A bare-knuckle killer. Icy blue eyes. I was giving it everything I had. I was willing myself to project all the invincibility, all the implacability, all the protection I felt. I was doing the hard, no-blink stare that used to shrivel up drunken marines two at a time. I wanted Roscoe to feel safe. After what she was giving me, I wanted to give her that. I didn\u0027t want her to feel afraid.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s going to take more than four little country boys to get me,\" I said. \"Who are they kidding? I\u0027ve shit better opponents than that. They come in here again, they\u0027ll go out in a bucket. And I\u0027ll tell you what, Roscoe, someone even thinks about hurting you, they die before they finish thinking.\"\\n\\n It was working. I was convincing her. I needed her to be bright, tough, self-confident. I was willing her to pick it up. It was working. Her amazing eyes were filling with spirit.\\n\\n \"I mean it, Roscoe,\" I said. \"Stick with me and you\u0027ll be OK.\"\\n\\n She looked at me again. Pushed her hair back.\\n\\n \"Promise?\" she said.\\n\\n \"You got it, babe,\" I said. Held my breath.\\n\\n She sighed a ragged sigh. Pushed off the wall and stepped over. Tried a brave smile. The crisis was gone. She was up and running.\\n\\n \"Now we get the hell out of here,\" I said. \"We can\u0027t stay around like sitting targets. So throw what you need into a bag.\"\\n\\n \"OK,\" she said. \"Are we going to fix my door first?\"\\n\\n I thought about her question. It was an important tactical issue.\\n\\n \"No,\" I said. \"If we fix it, it means we\u0027ve seen it. If we\u0027ve seen it, it means we know we\u0027re under attack. Better if they figure we don\u0027t know we\u0027re under attack. Because then they\u0027ll figure they don\u0027t need to be too careful next time. So we don\u0027t react at all. We make out we haven\u0027t been back here. We make out we haven\u0027t seen the door. We carry on acting dumb and innocent. If they think we\u0027re dumb and innocent, they\u0027ll get careless. Easier to spot them coming next time.\"\\n\\n \"OK,\" she said.\\n\\n She didn\u0027t sound convinced, but she was agreeing.\\n\\n \"So throw what you need into a bag,\" I said again.\\n\\n She wasn\u0027t happy, but she went off to gather up some stuff. The game was starting. I didn\u0027t know exactly who the other players were. I didn\u0027t even know exactly what the game was. But I knew how to play. Opening move was I wanted them to feel like we were always one step behind.\\n\\n \"Should I go to work today?\" Roscoe asked.\\n\\n \"Got to,\" I said. \"Can\u0027t do anything different from normal. And we need to speak with Finlay. He\u0027s expecting the call from Washington. And we need what we can get on Sherman Stoller. But don\u0027t worry, they\u0027re not going to gun us down in the middle of the squad room. They\u0027ll go for somewhere quiet and isolated, probably at night. Teale\u0027s the only bad guy up there, so just don\u0027t be on your own with him. Stick around Finlay or Baker or Stevenson, OK?\"\\n\\n She nodded. Went to get showered and dressed for work. Within twenty minutes, she came out of the bedroom in her uniform. Patted herself down. Ready for the day. She looked at me.\\n\\n \"Promise?\" she said.\\n\\n The way she said it was like a question, an apology, a reassurance all in one word. I looked back at her.\\n\\n \"You bet your ass,\" I said, and winked.\\n\\n She nodded. Winked back. We were OK. We went out the front door and left it slightly open, just like we\u0027d found it.\\n\\n I HID THE BENTLEY IN HER GARAGE TO MAINTAIN THE ILLUSION that we hadn\u0027t been back to her house. Then we got in her Chevy and decided to start with breakfast up at Eno\u0027s. She took off and gunned the car up the hill. It felt loose and low after the upright old Bentley. Coming down the hill toward us was a panel van. Smart dark green, very clean, brand-new. It looked like a utility van, but on the side was a sign in fancy gold script. It said: Kliner Foundation. Same as I\u0027d seen the gardeners using.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s that truck?\" I said to Roscoe.\\n\\n She wafted through the right at the convenience store. Up onto Main Street.\\n\\n \"Foundation\u0027s got a lot of trucks,\" she said.\\n\\n \"What is it they do?\" I asked her.\\n\\n \"Big deal around here,\" she said. \"Old man Kliner. The town sold him the land for his warehouses and part of the deal was he set up a community program. Teale runs it out of the mayor\u0027s office.\"\\n\\n \"Teale runs it?\" I said. \"Teale\u0027s the enemy.\"\\n\\n \"He runs it because he\u0027s the mayor,\" she said. \"Not because he\u0027s Teale. The program assigns a lot of money, spends it on public things, roads, gardens, the library, local business grants. Gives the police department a hell of a lot. Gives me a mortgage subsidy, just because I\u0027m with the department.\"\\n\\n \"Gives Teale a lot of power,\" I said. \"And what\u0027s the story with the Kliner boy? He tried to warn me off you. Made out he had a prior claim.\"\\n\\n She shuddered.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s a jerk,\" she said. \"I avoid him when I can. You should do the same.\"\\n\\n She drove on, looking edgy. Kept glancing around, startled. Like she felt under threat. Like someone was going to jump out in front of the car and gun us down. Her quiet life in the Georgia countryside was over. Four men in the night up at her house had shattered that.\\n\\n We pulled into Eno\u0027s gravel lot and the big Chevy rocked gently on its soft springs. I slid out of the low seat and we crunched across the gravel together to Eno\u0027s door. It was a gray day. The night rain had chilled the air and left rags of cloud all over the sky. The siding on the diner reflected the dullness. It was cold. It felt like a new season.\\n\\n We went in. The place was empty. We took a booth and the woman with glasses brought us coffee. We ordered eggs and bacon with all kinds of extras on the side. A black pickup was pulling into the lot outside. Same black pickup as I\u0027d seen three times before. Different driver. Not the Kliner kid. This was an older guy. Maybe approaching sixty, but bone-hard and lean. Iron-gray hair shaved close to his scalp. He was dressed like a rancher in denim. Looked like he lived outdoors in the sun. Even through Eno\u0027s window I could sense his power and feel the glare in his eyes. Roscoe nudged me and nodded at the guy.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s Kliner,\" she said. \"The old man himself.\"\\n\\n He pushed in through the door and stood for a moment. Looked left, looked right, and moved in to the lunch counter. Eno came around from the kitchen. The two of them talked quietly. Heads bent together. Then Kliner stood up again. Turned to the door. Stopped and looked left, looked right. Rested his gaze on Roscoe for a second. His face was lean and flat and hard. His mouth was a line carved into it. Then he moved his eyes onto me. I felt like I was being illuminated by a searchlight. His lips parted in a curious smile. He had amazing teeth. Long canines, canted inward, and flat square incisors. Yellow, like an old wolf. His lips closed again and he snapped his gaze away. Pulled the door and crunched over the gravel to his truck. Took off with the roar of a big motor and a spray of small stones.\\n\\n I watched him go and turned to Roscoe.\\n\\n \"So tell me more about these Kliner people,\" I said.\\n\\n She still looked edgy.\\n\\n \"Why?\" she said. \"We\u0027re fighting for our lives here and you want to talk about the Kliners?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m looking for information,\" I said. \"Kliner\u0027s name crops up everywhere. He looks like an interesting guy. His son is a piece of work. And I saw his wife. She looked unhappy. I\u0027m wondering if all that\u0027s got anything to do with anything.\"\\n\\n She shrugged and shook her head.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t see how,\" she said. \"They\u0027re newcomers, only been here five years. The family made a fortune in cotton processing, generations back, over in Mississippi. Invented some kind of a new chemical thing, some kind of a new formula. Chlorine or sodium something, I don\u0027t know for sure. Made a huge fortune, but they ran into trouble with the EPA over there, you know, about five years ago, pollution or something. There were fish dying all the way down to New Orleans because of dumping into the river.\"\\n\\n \"So what happened?\" I asked her.\\n\\n \"Kliner moved the whole plant,\" she said. \"The company was his by then. He shut down the whole Mississippi operation and set it up again in Venezuela or somewhere. Then he tried to diversify. He turned up here in Georgia five years ago with this warehouse thing, consumer goods, electronics or something.\"\\n\\n \"So they\u0027re not local?\" I said.\\n\\n \"Never saw them before five years ago,\" she said. \"Don\u0027t know much about them. But I never heard anything bad. Kliner\u0027s probably a tough guy, maybe even ruthless, but he\u0027s OK as long as you\u0027re not a fish, I guess.\"\\n\\n \"So why is his wife so scared?\" I said.\\n\\n Roscoe made a face.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s not scared,\" she said. \"She\u0027s sick. Maybe she\u0027s scared because she\u0027s sick. She\u0027s going to die, right? That\u0027s not Kliner\u0027s fault.\"\\n\\n The waitress arrived with the food. We ate in silence. The portions were huge. The fried stuff was great. The eggs were delicious. This guy Eno had a way with eggs. I washed it all down with pints of coffee. I had the waitress running back and forth with the refill jug.\\n\\n \"Pluribus means nothing at all to you?\" Roscoe asked. \"You guys never knew anything about some Pluribus thing? When you were kids?\"\\n\\n I thought hard and shook my head.\\n\\n \"Is it Latin?\" she asked.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s part of the United States\u0027 motto, right?\" I said. \"E Pluribus Unum. It means out of many, one. One nation built out of many former colonies.\"\\n\\n \"So Pluribus means many?\" she said. \"Did Joe know Latin?\"\\n\\n I shrugged.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got no idea,\" I said. \"Probably. He was a smart guy. He probably knew bits and pieces of Latin. I\u0027m not sure.\"\\n\\n \"OK,\" she said. \"You got no other ideas at all why Joe was down here?\"\\n\\n \"Money, maybe,\" I said. \"That\u0027s all I can think of. Joe worked for the Treasury Department, as far as I know. Hubble worked for a bank. Their only thing in common would be money. Maybe we\u0027ll find out from Washington. If we don\u0027t, we\u0027re going to have to start from the beginning.\"\\n\\n \"OK,\" she said. \"You need anything?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll need that arrest report from Florida,\" I said.\\n\\n \"For Sherman Stoller?\" she said. \"That\u0027s two years old.\"\\n\\n \"Got to start somewhere,\" I said.\\n\\n \"OK, I\u0027ll ask for it,\" she shrugged. \"I\u0027ll call Florida. Anything else?\"\\n\\n \"I need a gun,\" I said.\\n\\n She didn\u0027t reply. I dropped a twenty on the laminate tabletop and we slid out and stood up. Walked out to the unmarked car.\\n\\n \"I need a gun,\" I said again. \"This is a big deal, right? So I\u0027ll need a weapon. I can\u0027t just go to the store and buy one. No ID, no address.\"\\n\\n \"OK,\" she said. \"I\u0027ll get you one.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got no permit,\" I said. \"You\u0027ll have to do it on the quiet, OK?\"\\n\\n She nodded.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s OK,\" she said. \"There\u0027s one nobody else knows about.\"\\n\\n WE KISSED A LONG HARD KISS IN THE STATION HOUSE LOT. Then we got out of the car and went in through the heavy glass door. More or less bumped into Finlay rounding the reception counter on his way out.\\n\\n \"Got to go back to the morgue,\" he said. \"You guys come with me, OK? We need to talk. Lot to talk about.\"\\n\\n So we went back out into the dull morning. Got back into Roscoe\u0027s Chevy. Same system as before. She drove. I sat across the back. Finlay sat in the front passenger seat, twisted around so he could look at the both of us at once. Roscoe started up and headed south.\\n\\n \"Long call from the Treasury Department,\" Finlay said. \"Must have been twenty minutes, maybe a half hour. I was nervous about Teale.\"\\n\\n \"What did they say?\" I asked him.\\n\\n \"Nothing,\" he said. \"They took a half hour to tell me nothing.\"\\n\\n \"Nothing?\" I said. \"What the hell does that mean?\"\\n\\n \"They wouldn\u0027t tell me anything,\" he said. \"They want a shitload of formal authorization from Teale before they say word one.\"\\n\\n \"They confirmed Joe worked there, right?\" I said.\\n\\n \"Sure, they went that far,\" he said. \"He came from Military Intelligence ten years ago. They headhunted him. Recruited him specially.\"\\n\\n \"What for?\" I asked him.\\n\\n Finlay just shrugged.\\n\\n \"They wouldn\u0027t tell me,\" he said. \"He started some new project exactly a year ago, but the whole thing is a total secret. He was some kind of a very big deal up there, Reacher, that\u0027s for sure. You should have heard the way they were all talking about him. Like talking about God.\"\\n\\n I went quiet for a while. I had known nothing about Joe. Nothing at all.\\n\\n \"So that\u0027s it?\" I said. \"Is that all you got?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" he said. \"I kept pushing until I got a woman called Molly Beth Gordon. You ever heard that name?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" I said. \"Should I have?\"\\n\\n \"Sounds like she was very close to Joe,\" Finlay said. \"Sounds like they may have had a thing going. She was very upset. Floods of tears.\"\\n\\n \"So what did she tell you?\" I asked him.\\n\\n \"Nothing,\" Finlay said. \"Not authorized. But she promised to tell you what she can. She said she\u0027ll step out of line for you, because you\u0027re Joe\u0027s little brother.\"\\n\\n I nodded.\\n\\n \"OK,\" I said. \"That\u0027s better. When do I speak to her?\"\\n\\n \"Call her about one thirty,\" he said. \"Lunch break, when her office will be empty. She\u0027s taking a big risk, but she\u0027ll talk to you. That\u0027s what she said.\"\\n\\n \"OK,\" I said again. \"She say anything else?\"\\n\\n \"She let one little thing slip,\" Finlay said. \"Joe had a big debrief meeting scheduled. For next Monday morning.\"\\n\\n \"Monday?\" I said. \"As in the day after Sunday?\"\\n\\n \"Correct,\" he said. \"Looks like Hubble was right. Something is due to happen on or before Sunday. Whatever the hell he was doing, it looks like Joe knew he would have won or lost by then. But she wouldn\u0027t say anything more. She was out of line talking to me at all and she sounded like she was being overheard. So call her, but don\u0027t pin your hopes on her, Reacher. She may not know anything. Left hand doesn\u0027t know what the right hand is doing up there. Big-time secrecy, right?\"\\n\\n \"Bureaucracy,\" I said. \"Who the hell needs it? OK, we have to assume we\u0027re on our own here. At least for a while. We\u0027re going to need Picard again.\"\\n\\n Finlay nodded.\\n\\n \"He\u0027ll do what he can,\" he said. \"He called me last night. The Hubbles are secure. Right now, he\u0027s sitting on it, but he\u0027ll stand up for us if we need him.\"\\n\\n \"He should start tracing Joe,\" I said. \"Joe must have used a car. Probably flew down from Washington, into Atlanta, got a hotel room, rented a car, right? We should look for the car. He must have driven it down here Thursday night. It must have been dumped somewhere in the area. It might lead us back to the hotel. Maybe there would be something in Joe\u0027s hotel room. Files, maybe.\"\\n\\n \"Picard can\u0027t do that,\" Finlay said. \"FBI isn\u0027t equipped to go looking for abandoned rental cars. And we can\u0027t do it ourselves, not with Teale around.\"\\n\\n I shrugged.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll have to,\" I said. \"No other way. You can sell Teale some story. You can double bluff him. Tell him you figure the escaped con who he says did the Morrison thing must have been in a rental car. Tell him you need to check it out. He can\u0027t say no to that, or else he\u0027s undermining his own cover story, right?\"\\n\\n \"OK,\" Finlay said. \"I\u0027ll try it. Might work, I guess.\"\\n\\n \"Joe must have had phone numbers,\" I said. \"The number you found in his shoe was torn off a computer printout, right? So where\u0027s the rest of the printout? I bet it\u0027s in his hotel room, just sitting there, covered with phone numbers, with Hubble\u0027s number torn off the top. So you find the car, then you twist Picard\u0027s arm to trace the hotel through the rental company, OK?\"\\n\\n \"OK,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll do my best.\"\\n\\n IN YELLOW SPRINGS WE SLIPPED INTO THE HOSPITAL ENTRANCE lane and slowed over the speed bumps. Nosed around to the lot in back. Parked near the morgue door. I didn\u0027t want to go inside. Joe was still in there. I started to think vaguely about funeral arrangements. I\u0027d never had to do it before. The Marine Corps handled my father\u0027s. Joe arranged my mother\u0027s.\\n\\n But I got out of the car with the two of them and we walked through the chill air to the door. Found our way back to the shabby office. The same doctor was at the desk. Still in a white coat. Still looking tired. He waved us in and we sat down. I took one of the stools. I didn\u0027t want to sit next to the fax machine again. The doctor looked at all of us in turn. We looked back at him.\\n\\n \"What have you got for us?\" Finlay said.\\n\\n The tired man at the desk prepared to answer. Like preparing for a lecture. He picked up three files from his left and dropped them on his blotter. Opened the top one. Pulled out the second one and opened that, too.\\n\\n \"Morrison,\" he said. \"Mr. and Mrs.\"\\n\\n He glanced around the three of us again. Finlay nodded to him.\\n\\n \"Tortured and killed,\" the pathologist said. \"The sequence is pretty clear. The woman was restrained. Two men, I\u0027d say, one on each arm, gripping and twisting. Heavy bruising on the forearms and the upper arms, some ligament damage from twisting the arms up her back. Obviously the bruising continued to develop from the time she was first seized until the time she died. The bruising stops developing when the circulation stops, you understand?\"\\n\\n We nodded. We understood.\\n\\n \"I\u0027d put it at about ten minutes,\" he said. \"Ten minutes, beginning to end. So the woman was being held. The man was being nailed to the wall. I\u0027d guess both were naked by then. They were in nightwear before the attack, right?\"\\n\\n \"Robes,\" Finlay said. \"They were having breakfast.\"\\n\\n \"OK, the robes came off early on,\" the doctor said. \"The man was nailed to the wall, technically to the floor also, through the feet. His genital area was attacked. The scrotum was severed. Postmortem evidence suggests that the woman was persuaded to swallow the amputated testicles.\"\\n\\n The office was silent. Silent as a tomb. Roscoe looked at me. Stared at me for a while. Then she looked back at the doctor.\\n\\n \"I found them in her stomach,\" the doctor said.\\n\\n Roscoe was as white as the guy\u0027s coat. I thought she was going to pitch forward off her stool. She closed her eyes and hung on. She was hearing about what somebody had planned for us last night.\\n\\n \"And?\" Finlay said.\\n\\n \"The woman was mutilated,\" the doctor said. \"Breasts severed, genital area attacked, throat cut. Then the man\u0027s throat was cut. That was the last wound inflicted. You could see the arterial spray from his neck overlaying all the other bloodstains in the room.\"\\n\\n There was dead silence in the room. Lasted quite a while.\\n\\n \"Weapons?\" I asked.\\n\\n The guy at the desk swiveled his tired gaze toward me.\\n\\n \"Something sharp, obviously,\" he said. A slight grin. \"Straight, maybe five inches long.\"\\n\\n \"A razor?\" I said.\\n\\n \"No,\" he said. \"Certainly something as sharp as a razor, but rigid, not folding, and double-edged.\"\\n\\n \"Why?\" I said.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s evidence it was used back and forth,\" the guy said. He swished his hand back and forth in a tiny arc. \"Like this. On the woman\u0027s breasts. Cutting both ways. Like filleting a salmon.\"\\n\\n I nodded. Roscoe and Finlay were silent.\\n\\n \"What about the other guy?\" I said. \"Stoller?\"\\n\\n The pathologist pushed the two Morrison files to one side and opened up the third. Glanced through it and looked across at me. The third file was thicker than the first two.\\n\\n \"His name was Stoller?\" he said. \"We\u0027ve got him down as John Doe.\"\\n\\n Roscoe looked up.\\n\\n \"We sent you a fax,\" she said. \"Yesterday morning. We traced his prints.\"\\n\\n The pathologist rooted around on the messy desk. Found a curled-up fax. Read it and nodded. Crossed out \"John Doe\" on the folder and wrote in \"Sherman Stoller.\" Gave us his little grin again.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve had him since Sunday,\" he said. \"Been able to do a more thorough job, you know? A bit chewed up by the rats, but not pulped like the first guy, and altogether a lot less mess than the Morrisons.\"\\n\\n \"So what can you tell us?\" I said.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ve talked about the bullets, right?\" he said. \"Nothing more to add about the exact cause of death.\"\\n\\n \"So what else do you know?\" I asked him.\\n\\n The file was too thick for just the shooting and running and bleeding to death bits. This guy clearly had more to tell us. I saw him put his fingers on the pages and press lightly. Like he was trying to get vibrations or read the file in Braille.\\n\\n \"He was a truck driver,\" he said.\\n\\n \"He was?\" I said.\\n\\n \"I think so,\" the guy said. Sounded confident.\\n\\n Finlay looked up. He was interested. He loved the process of deduction. It fascinated him. Like when I\u0027d scored with those long shots about Harvard, his divorce, quitting smoking.\\n\\n \"Go on,\" he said.\\n\\n \"OK, briefly,\" the pathologist said. \"I found certain persuasive factors. A sedentary job, because his musculature was slack, his posture poor, flabby buttocks. Slightly rough hands, a fair bit of old diesel fuel ingrained in the skin. Also traces of old diesel fuel on the soles of his shoes. Internally, a poor diet, high in fat, plus a bit too much hydrogen sulfide in the blood gases and the tissues. This guy spent his life on the road, sniffing other people\u0027s catalytic converters. I make him a truck driver, because of the diesel fuel.\"\\n\\n Finlay nodded. I nodded. Stoller had come in with no ID, no history, nothing but his watch. This guy was pretty good. He watched us nod our approval. Looked pleased. Looked like he had more to say.\\n\\n \"But he\u0027s been out of work for a while,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Why?\" Finlay asked him.\\n\\n \"Because all that evidence is old,\" the doctor said. \"Looks to me like he was driving a lot for a long period, but then he stopped. I think he\u0027s done very little driving for nine months, maybe a year. So I make him a truck driver, but an unemployed truck driver.\"\\n\\n \"OK, doc, good work,\" Finlay said. \"You got copies of all that for us?\"\\n\\n The doctor slid a large envelope across the desk. Finlay stepped over and picked it up. Then we all stood up. I wanted to get out. I didn\u0027t want to go back to the cold store again. I didn\u0027t want to see any more damage. Roscoe and Finlay sensed it and nodded. We hustled out like we were ten minutes late for something. The guy at the desk let us go. He\u0027d seen lots of people rushing out of his office like they were ten minutes late for something.\\n\\n We got into Roscoe\u0027s car. Finlay opened the big envelope and pulled out the stuff on Sherman Stoller. Folded it into his pocket.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s ours, for the time being,\" he said. \"It might get us somewhere.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll get the arrest report from Florida,\" Roscoe said. \"And we\u0027ll find an address for him somewhere. Got to be a lot of paperwork on a trucker, right? Union, medical, licenses. Should be easy enough to do.\"\\n\\n We rode the rest of the way back to Margrave in silence. The station house was deserted, apart from the desk guy. Lunch break in Margrave, lunch break in Washington, D.C. Same time zone. Finlay handed me a scrap of paper from his pocket and stood guard on the door to the rosewood office. I went inside to call the woman who may have been my brother\u0027s lover.\\n\\n THE NUMBER FINLAY HAD HANDED ME REACHED MOLLY Beth Gordon\u0027s private line. She answered on the first ring. I gave her my name. It made her cry.\\n\\n \"You sound so much like Joe,\" she said.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t reply. I didn\u0027t want to get into a whole lot of reminiscing. Neither should she, not if she was stepping out of line and was in danger of being overheard. She should just tell me what she had to tell me and get off the line.\\n\\n \"So what was Joe doing down here?\" I asked her.\\n\\n I heard her sniffing, and then her voice came back clear.\\n\\n \"He was running an investigation,\" she said. \"Into what, I don\u0027t know specifically.\"\\n\\n \"But what sort of a thing?\" I asked her. \"What was his job?\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you know?\" she said.\\n\\n \"No,\" I said. \"We found it very hard to keep in touch, I\u0027m afraid. You\u0027ll have to start from the beginning for me.\"\\n\\n There was a long pause on the line.\\n\\n \"OK,\" she said. \"I shouldn\u0027t tell you this. Not without clearance. But I will. It was counterfeiting. He ran the Treasury\u0027s anticounterfeiting operation.\"\\n\\n \"Counterfeiting?\" I said. \"Counterfeit money?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" she said. \"He was head of the department. Ran the whole show. He was an amazing guy, Jack.\"\\n\\n \"But why was he down here in Georgia?\" I asked her.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" she said. \"I really don\u0027t. What I aim to do is find out for you. I can copy his files. I know his computer password.\"\\n\\n There was another pause. Now I knew something about Molly Beth Gordon. I\u0027d spent a lot of time on computer passwords. Any military cop does. I\u0027d studied the pyschology. Most users make bad choices. A lot of them write the damn word on a Post-it note and stick it on the monitor case. The ones who are too smart to do that use their spouse\u0027s name, or their dog\u0027s name, or their favorite car or ball player, or the name of the island where they took their honeymoon or balled their secretary. The ones who think they\u0027re really smart use figures, not words, but they choose their birthday or their wedding anniversary or something pretty obvious. If you can find something out about the user, you\u0027ve normally got a better than even chance of figuring their password.\\n\\n But that would never work with Joe. He was a professional. He\u0027d spent important years in Military Intelligence. His password would be a random mixture of numbers, letters, punctuation marks, upper and lower case. His password would be unbreakable. If Molly Beth Gordon knew what it was, Joe must have told her. No other way. He had really trusted her. He had been really close to her. So I put some tenderness into my voice.\\n\\n \"Molly, that would be great,\" I said. \"I really need that information.\"\\n\\n \"I know you do,\" she said. \"I hope to get it tomorrow. I\u0027ll call you again, soon as I can. Soon as I know something.\"\\n\\n \"Is there counterfeiting going on down here?\" I asked her. \"Is that what this could be all about?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" she said. \"It doesn\u0027t happen like that. Not inside the States. All that stuff about little guys with green eye-shades down in secret cellars printing dollar bills is all nonsense. Just doesn\u0027t happen. Joe stopped it. Your brother was a genius, Jack. He set up procedures years ago for the special paper sales and the inks, so if somebody starts up, he gets nailed within days. One hundred percent foolproof. Printing money in the States just doesn\u0027t happen anymore. Joe made sure of that. It all happens abroad. Any fakes we get here are shipped in. That\u0027s what Joe spent his time chasing. International stuff. Why he was in Georgia, I don\u0027t know. I really don\u0027t. But I\u0027ll find out tomorrow, I promise you that.\"\\n\\n I gave her the station house number and told her to speak to nobody except me or Roscoe or Finlay. Then she hung up in a hurry like somebody had just walked in on her. I sat for a moment and tried to imagine what she looked like.\\n\\n TEALE WAS BACK IN THE STATION HOUSE. AND OLD MAN Kliner was inside with him. They were over by the reception counter, heads together. Kliner was talking to Teale like I\u0027d seen him talking to Eno at the diner. Foundation business, maybe. Roscoe and Finlay were standing together by the cells. I walked over to them. Stood between them and talked low.\\n\\n \"Counterfeiting,\" I said. \"This is about counterfeit money. Joe was running the Treasury Department\u0027s defense for them. You know anything about that sort of a thing down here? Either of you?\"\\n\\n They both shrugged and shook their heads. I heard the glass door suck open. Looked up. Kliner was on his way out. Teale was starting in toward us.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m out of here,\" I said.\\n\\n I brushed past Teale and headed for the door. Kliner was standing in the lot, next to the black pickup. Waiting for me. He smiled. Wolf\u0027s teeth showing.\\n\\n \"Sorry for your loss,\" he said.\\n\\n His voice had a quiet, cultured tone. Educated. A slight hiss on the sibilants. Not the voice to go with his sunbaked appearance.\\n\\n \"You upset my son,\" he said.\\n\\n He looked at me. Something burning in his eyes. I shrugged.\\n\\n \"The kid upset me first,\" I said.\\n\\n \"How?\" Kliner asked. Sharply.\\n\\n \"He lived and breathed?\" I said.\\n\\n I moved on across the lot. Kliner slid into the black pickup. Fired it up and nosed out. He turned north. I turned south. Started the walk down to Roscoe\u0027s place. It was a half mile through the new fall chill. Ten minutes at a brisk pace. I got the Bentley out of the garage. Drove it back up the slope to town. Made the right onto Main Street and cruised along. I was peering left and right in under the smart striped awnings, looking for the clothes store. Found it three doors north of the barbershop. Left the Bentley on the street and went in. Paid out some of Charlie Hubble\u0027s expenses cash to a sullen middle-aged guy for a pair of pants, a shirt and a jacket. A light fawn color, pressed cotton, as near to formal as I was prepared to go. No tie. I put it all on in the changing cubicle in the back of the store. Bagged up the old stuff and threw it in the Bentley\u0027s trunk as I passed.\\n\\n I walked the three doors south to the barbershop. The younger of the two old guys was on his way out of the door. He stopped and put his hand on my arm.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s your name, son?\" he asked me.\\n\\n No reason not to tell him. Not that I could see.\\n\\n \"Jack Reacher,\" I said.\\n\\n \"You got any Hispanic friends in town?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Well, you got some now,\" he said. \"Two guys, looking all over for you.\"\\n\\n I looked at him. He scanned the street.\\n\\n \"Who were they?\" I asked him.\\n\\n \"Never saw them before,\" the old guy said. \"Little guys, brown car, fancy shirts. Been all over, asking for Jack Reacher. We told them we never heard of no Jack Reacher.\"\\n\\n \"When was this?\" I said.\\n\\n \"This morning,\" he said. \"After breakfast.\"\\n\\n I nodded.\\n\\n \"OK,\" I said. \"Thanks.\"\\n\\n The guy held the door open for me.\\n\\n \"Go right in,\" he said. \"My partner will take care of you. But he\u0027s a bit skittish this morning. Getting old.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks,\" I said again. \"See you around.\"\\n\\n \"Sure hope so, son,\" he said.\\n\\n He strolled off down Main Street and I went inside his shop. The older guy was in there. The gnarled old man whose sister had sung with Blind Blake. No other customers. I nodded to the old guy and sat down in his chair.\\n\\n \"Good morning, my friend,\" he said.\\n\\n \"You remember me?\" I said.\\n\\n \"Sure do,\" he said. \"You were our last customer. Nobody in between to muddle me up.\"\\n\\n I asked him for a shave and he set about whipping up the lather.\\n\\n \"I was your last customer?\" I said. \"That was Sunday. Today is Tuesday. Business always that bad?\"\\n\\n The old guy paused and gestured with the razor.\\n\\n \"Been that bad for years,\" he said. \"Old Mayor Teale won\u0027t come in here, and what the old mayor won\u0027t do, nobody else white will do neither. Except old Mr. Gray from the station house, came in here regular as clockwork three, four times a week, until he went and hung himself, God rest his soul. You\u0027re the first white face in here since last February, yes sir, that\u0027s for sure.\"\\n\\n \"Why won\u0027t Teale come in here?\" I asked him.\\n\\n \"Man\u0027s got a problem,\" the old guy said. \"I figure he don\u0027t like to sit all swathed up in the towel while there\u0027s a black man standing next to him with a razor. Maybe worried something bad might happen to him.\"\\n\\n \"Might something bad happen to him?\" I said.\\n\\n He laughed a short laugh.\\n\\n \"I figure there\u0027s a serious risk,\" he said. \"Asshole.\"\\n\\n \"So you got enough black customers to make a living?\" I asked him.\\n\\n He put the towel around my shoulders and started brushing on the lather.\\n\\n \"Man, we don\u0027t need customers to make a living,\" he said.\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t?\" I said. \"Why not?\"\\n\\n \"We got the community money,\" he said.\\n\\n \"You do?\" I said. \"What\u0027s that?\"\\n\\n \"Thousand dollars,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Who gives you that?\" I asked him.\\n\\n He started scraping my chin. His hand was shaking like old people do.\\n\\n \"Kliner Foundation,\" he whispered. \"The community program. It\u0027s a business grant. All the merchants get it. Been getting it five years.\"\\n\\n I nodded.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s good,\" I said. \"But a thousand bucks a year won\u0027t keep you. It\u0027s better than a poke in the eye, but you need customers too, right?\"\\n\\n I was just making conversation, like you do with barbers. But it set the old guy off. He was shaking and cackling. Had a whole lot of trouble finishing the shave. I was staring into the mirror. After last night, it would be a hell of a thing to get my throat cut by accident.\\n\\n \"Man, I shouldn\u0027t tell you about it,\" he whispered. \"But seeing as you\u0027re a friend of my sister\u0027s, I\u0027m going to tell you a big secret.\"\\n\\n He was getting confused. I wasn\u0027t a friend of his sister\u0027s. Didn\u0027t even know her. He\u0027d told me about her, was all. He was standing there with the razor. We were looking at each other in the mirror. Like with Finlay in the coffee shop.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not a thousand dollars a year,\" he whispered. Then he bent close to my ear. \"It\u0027s a thousand dollars a week.\"\\n\\n He started stomping around, chuckling like a demon. He filled the sink and dabbed off the spare lather. Patted my face down with a hot wet cloth. Then he whipped the towel off my shoulders like a conjurer doing a trick.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s why we don\u0027t need no customers,\" he cackled.\\n\\n I paid him and got out. The guy was crazy.\\n\\n \"Say hello to my sister,\" he called after me. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/killing-floor-jack-reacher-1/page-16.html","bookId":2339,"book":{"id":2339,"title":"Killing Floor (Jack Reacher #1)","description":"Storyline: Due to some reason, the article content has been deleted.

He’s just passing through Margrave, Georgia, and in less than an hour, he’s arrested for murder. Not much of a welcome. All Reacher knows is that he didn’t kill anybody. At least not here. Not lately. But he doesn’t stand a chance of convincing anyone. Not in Margrave, Georgia. Not a chance in hell. \\n The sleepy, forgotten town of Margrave, Georgia, hasn\u0027t seen a crime in decades, but within the span of three days it witnesses events that leave everyone stunned. An unidentified man is found beaten and shot to death on a lonely country road. The police chief and his wife are butchered on a quiet Sunday morning. Then a bank executive disappears from his home, leaving his keys on the table and his wife frozen with fear. The easiest suspect is Jack Reacher - an outsider, a man just passing through. But Reacher is a tough ex-military policeman, trained to think fast and act faster. When authorities learn the first victim was someone from Reacher\u0027s past, and he cannot convince them of his innocence, his patient self-defense becomes a raging crusade of revenge. With two cops who believe in him - a thoughtful black detective and a woman named Roscoe - he closes in on a ruthless conspiracy hiding behind Margrave\u0027s rural charm. But closing in on him is a team of killers. Step by step, the two teams circle - waiting to see which will be the first to walk onto the killing floor.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/killing-floor-jack-reacher-1.jpg","author":"Lee Child","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/killing-floor-jack-reacher-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:36 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:57:36 AM"}}
