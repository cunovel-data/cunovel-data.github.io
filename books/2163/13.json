{"id":97661,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"Things were quiet but tense on the ship of chaos. Pharaun tried not to look at Quenthel. He couldn\u0027t help but notice that she seemed unable to take Reverie. Her shoulders were stiff, and her viper-headed scourge never left her hand. The snakes writhed constantly, sliding the sides of their arrowlike heads against the priestess\u0027s warm black skin. The uridezu was surreptitiously eyeing her. Pharaun found that curious. He was the one who had bound the demon, yet Raashub was more concerned with Quenthel. True, the Baenre priestess was still nominally \"in charge\" of the expedition, but her leadership had always been more ceremonial-at least in Pharaun\u0027s mind.\n The Master of Sorcere couldn\u0027t quite organize his thoughts on the matter-not just then anyway-but the demon was looking at her oddly.\n He sighed and stared out across the black water of the Lake of Shadows again. He placed his hand on the rail then removed it when he felt the warm pulse of blood running through it. The ship barely moved in the dead calm of the black lake, but still Pharaun felt as if he needed to hold onto something. His hand found the twisted gray-yellow rigging-looking for all the world like a length of intestine-but he couldn\u0027t hold that much longer either.\n The demonic ship didn\u0027t quite figure into Pharaun\u0027s esthetic. The wizard brushed the hair from his eyes and tried not to think about what he must look like. He hadn\u0027t bathed in far too long-hygiene had become secondary for them all, and they were rapidly beginning to stink. Jeggred was the worst of them all on a good day, but the wizard found himself avoiding Quenthel as well. Still, the thought of bathing in the cold, dark waters of the Lake of Shadows held no appeal. Pharaun could well imagine what might be living in that lake\u0027s depths, and he didn\u0027t want to offer himself up like a worm on a hook.\n The ship creaked and groaned but not too much. Only rarely did there come the echo of a splash or drip or other small disturbance from the water. Pharaun was beginning to think it was the silence itself that he found so unnerving. Something hit him in the back of the head hard enough to drive him facefirst into the bonework deck.\n Surprised as much by the fact that he\u0027d been taken by surprise, Pharaun lay blinking for a few seconds-enough time for whatever had hit him to grab him by the ankle. His foot instantly went numb, then whatever it was lifted him bodily off the deck. Still not quite having regained his wits-Pharaun hadn\u0027t realized at first that he\u0027d been hit that hard-the Master of Sorcere found himself being spun in the air by the ankle. As he was whirled through the air, he caught glimpses of what was happening.\n A party of uridezu were boarding the ship, crawling over the rail dripping with lake water and maggots. Their gray skin glistening and their pink tails twitching, the rat demons attacked in force, though Pharaun couldn\u0027t get an accurate count of them while being spun around by the ankle by another uridezu. The wizard knew that he\u0027d been right, that the first uridezu Raashub had gated in was meant to test them.\n The demon let go, and Pharaun was sent pinwheeling through the air. He watched the rail pass beneath him, and when he was over open water he cast a spell while still in midair. By the time he hit the surface in a sprawling, stinging splash, Pharaun could breathe water.\n The wizard didn\u0027t waste any time. Swimming and using the levitating powers of his brooch to help pull him downward, Pharaun dived deeper and deeper into the pitch-black water. The lake was cold enough to make him tense and stiff, but he still swam as fast as he could. All around him were the shadows of living things. There were fish, he hoped, and snakes, he feared, and other things-things crawling on the bottom.\n The lakebed was covered in a fine silt that felt oddly alluring to the touch. Pharaun let himself sink into it up to his neck and closed his eyes to mere slits so that all anyone might be able to see would be his black face against the uniformly black silt.\n Something brushed past his leg, but Pharaun didn\u0027t move.\n The deep water and the stirred-up silt taxed Pharaun\u0027s darkvision to its limits, but he saw two uridezu dive into the water above him. Secure in his hiding place, ignoring another . . . something . . . slipping past his side, Pharaun watched the rat-demons swim with surprising agility, their heads waving back and forth as they searched the lake bed for the drow wizard. Pharaun waited for them to draw closer . . . closer . . . close enough. He threw an aura of faerie fire around them both.\n The demons reacted to the magic with twitching confusion. The purple light not only outlined their silhouettes in the dark water, making them painfully obvious, it also picked out details of the folds of their skin, their whiskers, and the knitting of their worried brows.\n Pharaun kicked once and rose slowly from the silt, already casting a spell. The uridezu looked over at him and swished their tails in the water. They swam quickly away from each other, smart enough not to both be caught in the same spell. Pharaun picked one at random and froze the water around it.\n The Master of Sorcere knew that the ice would have no wounding effect on the demon, but it was thick enough to stop it. Pharaun smiled briefly at his handiwork. The uridezu, frozen solid in a thick block of ice, slowly sank to the lakebed, leaving a trail of bubbles in its path.\n The second uridezu swam in fast, a stream of glowing purple maggots fanning out behind it. The tiny worms came from its ruined left eye, an old wound that had evidently festered for a very long time.\n Pharaun tried toswim away from it, but the rat-demon was faster. It whirled in the water and brought its leathery pink tail to bear on the wizard. Pharaun took the hit with a grimace. It hurt.\n As the uridezu twisted around, obviously meaning to shred Pharaun with its ragged claws, the Master of Sorcere touched his steel ring. The rapier appeared before him, and Pharaun set it against the demon with a thought. The dancing sword scored a deep slash,and the uridezu\u0027s attention-as Pharaun had planned-was drawn entirely to defending itself against the magically animated blade.\n Content to let the rapier keep the demon busy, Pharaun kicked away from the duel, pulling his hand crossbow and a quarrel from his belt at the same time. When the bolt was set and cocked, Pharaun called on the power of his brooch to levitate quickly up and out of the lake. The second his face broke the surface he coughed out lungfuls of fluid. He shot into the air a dozen feet above the water and hung there, black droplets pattering off him to rain back down onto the rippling surface of the Lake of Shadows.\n The wizard turned his attention to the ship of chaos. Never had the vessel seemed so aptly named. Quenthel and the draegloth fought for their lives against the rat-demon boarding party. Before Pharaun could get the whole situation sorted, Jeggred ripped a gash in the belly of one uridezu that was deep enough to spill its bowels onto the deck. It crumpled in a heap of steaming entrails at the blood-soaked draegloth\u0027s feet.\n Pharaun counted four more of the demons, in addition to Raashub. The captain had gathered seven of his kind.\n The wizard looked down, checking on the progress of the dancing rapier. The animated blade slit the swimming uridezu\u0027s throat. The demon shivered then went limp in the water, slowly floating to the surface. Its scalding blood sent coppery-smelling steam rising into the air below the hovering mage.\n Pharaun recalled his rapier. Leveling his hand crossbow, he looked back at the ship of chaos. Quenthel held one uridezu at bay with her whip while another rushed her from behind. Pharaun couldn\u0027t get a clear shot, so he paused, and that was all the time it took for the uridezu behind her to bite Quenthel in the neck.\n Blood welled up around the deep wound, and the high priestess gnashed her teeth in pain. With a hard, sharp jerk of her shoulder, Quenthel knocked the demon away. From a distance it was difficult for Pharaun to see, but he was sure the uridezu left a few teeth in the mistress\u0027s neck.\n Movement from Jeggred caught Pharaun\u0027s eye. The draegloth advanced on Raashub. A wave of panic coursed through the Master of Sorcere. Attack or no attack, they needed Raashub to pilot the ship. Jeggred had been itching to kill the captain since they\u0027d first claimed the vessel, and the boarding action was excuse enough for him to finally make good on his many threats.\n Pharaun, fully aware of the irony of the situation, threw a spell that set a wall of invisible force between the uridezu captain and the advancing draegloth. Jeggred hit the wall hard, setting him back on his heels for a moment. Raashub cowered away from the draegloth then started to sniff the air in front of him, as puzzled byhis unexplained, last-second reprieve as was Jeggred.\n Quenthel threw an elbow at the uridezu that had bitten her, but the demon was able to avoid the blow. Quenthel\u0027s attacks were spasmodic and haphazard, and Pharaun knew it was only a matter of time before the two uridezu she faced managed to kill her.\n The Master of Sorcere made his way quickly through a spell and sent its energy flowing out from him to the uridezu that had bitten Quenthel.\n An enormous, disembodied black hand faded into existence from the thin air, and Pharaun took control over it with a thought. The uridezu that were harrying Quenthel stepped back from the hand but too slowly for the demon that had bitten her. The hand closed around the creature and began to squeeze.\n Taking stock of the situation again, Pharaun saw that Jeggred had moved on to another uridezu, leaving Raashub to grovel behind the wall of force.\n The wizard had only to will the spell-hand to squeeze as hard as it could and he could leave it to its own devices. As the uridezu trapped in the hand started gasping for air, Pharaun tightened his finger around the trigger of his hand crossbow and sent the bolt whizzing through the air. The missile slammed into the other demon\u0027s chest. It paused and turned to look at the source of the projectile.\n The uridezu in the hand had its mouth wide open, but no sound came out. All the air had been squeezed from its lungs. Pharaun reloaded his hand crossbow, and the conjured hand squeezed even tighter. The demon\u0027s eyes bulged, and Pharaun couldn\u0027t help but watch.\n The wizard launched another bolt at the demon that was still managing to dodge the high priestess\u0027s whip. The missile slammed home, pushing the uridezu toward Quenthel. The rat-man was staggered but far from dead-which was more than Pharaun could say for the creature in the hand. Its body bulged past the breaking point then burst in a torrent of blood and tissue. A few agonizing seconds later and it was dead.\n Pharaun reloaded his hand crossbow again and watched the uridezu his last bolt had pushed toward Quenthel. The high priestess advanced quickly, scourge in one hand, the other wrapped into a tight fist.\n The Mistress of the Academy hit the uridezu that faced her so hard its head burst into several large pieces that fell completely away from its shoulders. The rat-demon\u0027s glistening gray-and-yellow brain came free and went skipping out across the still surface of the lake. Pharaun knew that her strength was coming from a magic item, and he made a mental note to stop being surprised by feats of strength from the priestess.\n Movement and light from below him caught Pharaun\u0027s attention. The uridezu he\u0027d frozen in place had finally managed to break free, andit was moving with great whips of its ratlike tail. It swam up and toward Pharaun, who was still hovering and dripping above the water.\n Pharaun cast a spell that let him push the advancing demon back down into the water. The Master of Sorcere continued pushing until the uridezu slipped beneath the layer of silt. He pushed harder until the creature finally hit the rocky lake bed, four feet under the drifting sediment. He pressed, crushing the monster into the lake bed. He could feel the thing\u0027s back break but kept pressing still.\n Aliisza held her breath watching the drow fight off the uridezu. The rat-demons weren\u0027t necessarily the most impressive foes, but all things considered the dark elves made a fine show of it. Pharaun was especially alluring, hanging in midair over the water, so wet and intense. It made Aliisza all tingly.\n The invisible alu-fiend drifted in the air over the regal female drow, who had been paralyzed by the bite of the uridezu she\u0027d dispatched in a messy and uncreative way.\n Another of the rat-demons swayed before the paralyzed priestess, its fangs bared and dripping with toxic spittle. It giggled in a shrill, excited way as it inched ever closer to the helpless drow female.\n A low rumble drew Aliisza\u0027s attention to the draegloth. The half-demon growled in the face of another rat-demon then slashed the thing across the midsection with the razor claws of one hand. The demon bounced back on its heels only barely far enough to avoid having its guts opened onto the deck. A hiss exploded from the uridezu\u0027s quivering lips, and its tail lashed around at the draegloth. The half-drow, half-demon behemoth avoided the appendage with surprising agility.\n The captain of the ship of chaos rattled his chain but remained bound to the deck. Aliisza sensed the presence of an invisible wall separating the captain from the rest of them. It was as if the air had turned solid there. She could see the magic shimmering in her Weave-sensitive eyesight.\n Aliisza didn\u0027t particularly care what became of the uridezu captain or the uncouth, unappealing draegloth, but she couldn\u0027t stand the thought of the attractive, impressive drow priestess being eaten alive while paralyzed by a creature as lowly as an uridezu. The alu-fiend began to drain the life-force from that particular rat-creature while still hanging invisible in the air. The uridezu looked around. It could feel that something bad was happening to it. Maybe it felt cold, or weak, dizzy, sick. Aliisza was killing it, and it had to know it was dying. The rat-demon drew its arms around itself, and Aliisza sensed that it was on its way back to the Abyss-but something kept it there on the ship. Aliisza could see that magic too, binding it to the very air around them. Only Pharaun could have been responsible for that.\n The fact that the dark elf wizard had that power made Aliisza uneasy.\n She wondered where the invisible wall had come from when she heard a horrid ripping sound and had to dodge an arc of dark-red blood. The draegloth ripped the arm off the uridezu that was stupid enough to stand up to him. Aliisza didn\u0027t like the smell of the rat-demon\u0027s blood ... at least not as much as the draegloth seemed to.\n The half-demon picked up the uridezu\u0027s arm and lifted it behind him until it bounced off the invisible wall. That startled the draegloth-no, not startled, annoyed him. Aliisza realized someone was trying to separate the uridezu captain and the draegloth.\n That had to be Pharaun\u0027s handiwork. As the draegloth beat the rat-demon to death with its own arm, Aliisza sorted out why the wizard might be trying to protect the captain.\n She whispered a quick spell and rose higher into the air so that no one but Pharaun would be able to hear her. She had to stop draining the life-force from the last survivor of the demonic boarding party, but the draegloth had already begun stalking toward it.\n \"Pharaun,\" she whispered over the intervening yards, her voice coming to the drow wizard as a whisper in his ear.\n She saw the mage react and continued, \"Yes, it\u0027s me. You\u0027re protecting the captain from your own draegloth?\"\n \"What of it?\" the wizard asked, his voice sounding as a whisper in her ear too. \"You don\u0027t need him,\" she said.\n \"Yes, I do,\" replied the mage. \"It\u0027s a ship of chaos, Aliisza, and I\u0027m a drow who isn\u0027t much for boats. I\u0027ve never piloted one of these things before.\n Probably no drow in history ever has.\"\n \"It\u0027s not that hard,\" she explained. \"The ship is alive. You simply will it to go where you want.\"\n \"It\u0027s that easy?\" Pharaun asked, skeptical.\n Aliisza watched the draegloth shred the weakened uridezu with a flurry of claws and fangs and said, \"After a fashion, yes.\"\n Barely missing a beat, the half-demon turned on the invisible wall and went at it with claw and fang, wild and feral. The sight made Aliisza\u0027s heart race. The uridezu captain was cowering behind the wall. He didn\u0027t bother trying to pretend he didn\u0027t know what the draegloth was going to do to him if he got through the invisible barrier.\n \"Let the draegloth have him, darling,\" Aliisza said as her spell began to fade. \"We can pilot the ship together.\"\n Pharaun opened a dimensional rift and stepped through. In an instant he was standing on the deck of the ship of chaos next to the paralyzed priestess and directly under the hovering,unseen alu-fiend. She began to sink toward him. \"Jeggred,\" the drow wizard said to the draegloth, \"stop it. Stop it, now. We need him.\"\n The wizard turned to the high priestess, who stood, her hand dripping with uridezu gore. The snakes at the end of her whip hissed at Pharaun, warning him away.\n \"Mistress,\" he said to her, \"tell him to stop it.\"\n \"She\u0027s paralyzed,\" Aliisza whispered in his ear, close enough then to do it without a spell.\n Pharaun didn\u0027t flinch but smiled and said, \"He won\u0027t listen to me.\"\n \"I told you it\u0027s all right, Pharaun,\" whispered the alu-fiend, \"we don\u0027t need him.\"\n \"We?\" he asked.\n Aliisza blushed, though Pharaun still couldn\u0027t see her.\n \"If Raashub can pilot this vessel,\" she asked, \"why can\u0027t we? Could it be that hard?\" Pharaun drew in a deep breath and let it out in a sigh.\n \"He\u0027s only going to keep defying me anyway, isn\u0027t he?\" Pharaun asked.\n \"Who are you . . .\" Quenthel said, her joints jerking as she recovered from the uridezu\u0027s paralyzing bite, \". . . talking to?\"\n \"Wouldn\u0027t you, in his place?\" Aliisza whispered, ignoring the high priestess. Pharaun turned to her and looked her in the eyes, though she was sure he wasn\u0027t able to see her. He winked at her then turned back to the priestess.\n \"Jeggred means to kill the captain,\" he said.\n \"Let him,\" the priestess replied as she scanned the deck apparently looking for something with which to clean the blood off her.\n \"Well,\" Aliisza whispered into the wizard\u0027s ear, \"it\u0027s her idea now, isn\u0027t it?\" Pharaun waved a hand and dropped the wall.\n The draegloth leaped onto the uridezu captain. They both went over the rail. The chain that bound the uridezu to the deck-and to the material plane-snapped as if it were made of mushroom stem. There was a huge, echoing splash that sent lake water rolling onto the deck to mingle with the spilled demon blood.\n Aliisza hovered over them as Pharaun and Quenthel ran to the rail and looked over into the black water. Bubbles peppered the surface, and there were ripples that made it obvious that some violence was occurring below the surface.\n Then the bubbles stopped. The ripples played themselves out, and there was nothing.\n \"Go after them,\" the priestess said to Pharaun.\n Aliisza caught herself before she laughed out loud.\n Pharaun raised an eyebrow, looked at the priestess, and said, \"I\u0027m afraid I had to cancel the spell that allowed me to breathe underwater.\"\n The priestess turned on him angrily, but any further discussion was stopped by the sound of another splash. Something arced out of the water and thumped onto the deck. The uridezu captain\u0027s head rolled to the other side of the ship and came to rest looking blankly up at nothing.\n \"Well,\" Quenthel breathed, glancing at Pharaun, \"never mind.\"\n The draegloth climbed slowly onto the deck behind the two dark elves. The half-demon shook himself hard, spraying water all over Pharaun and Quenthel. The two dark elves turned to regard the draegloth.\n \"That,\" the half-demon rumbled, \"was almost worth the wait.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/annihilation-war-of-the-spider-queen-5/page-13.html","bookId":2163,"book":{"id":2163,"title":"Annihilation (War of the Spider Queen #5)","description":"Storyline: \n Annihilation: War of the Spider Queen, Book V (R.A Salvatore Presents the War of the Spider Queen) \n The fifth title in the New York Times best-selling saga of civil war and chaos in the darkest part of the Forgotten Realms setting.
