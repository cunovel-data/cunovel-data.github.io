{"id":97653,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"A little more than half a mile under the ruins of the surface city of Tilverton, two dark elves ran.\n Danifae breathed hard trying to keep up with Valas, but she stayed only a few strides behind him. The scout moved in something between a walk and run, his feet sometimes appearing not even to touch the slick flowstone of the tunnel floor. As they\u0027d emerged from the last in a rapid, head-spinning series of gates, Valas had told her they were more than halfway to Sschindylryn, and it had been only a single day. Danifae admired the mercenary\u0027s skill in navigating the Underdark, even as she dismissed his obvious lack of ambition and drive. He seemed content in his position as a hired hand-scout and errand boy for Quenthel Baenre-and the idea of that sort of contentmentwas utterly alien to Danifae. After all, she thought in time, Valas is only a male.\n The scout came to an abrupt halt, so abrupt in fact that Danifae had to stumble to an undignified stop to avoid running into him. Happy for the chance to pause and rest, though, she didn\u0027t bother to complain.\n \"Where-?\" she started, but Valas held up a hand to silence her.\n Even after all her years as a battle-captive, a servant to the foolish and slow-witted Halisstra Melarn, Danifae hadn\u0027t grown accustomed to shutting up when told to. She bristled at the scout\u0027s dismissive gesture but calmed herself quickly. Valas was in his element, and if he wanted silence, both their lives might well depend on it.\n He turned to her, and Danifae was surprised to see no hint of annoyance or irritation on his face, even as her one word still echoed faintly in the cool, still air of the cavern.\n Another portal up ahead, he told her with his fingers. It will take us far, almost to Sschindylryn\u0027s eastern gate, but it\u0027s not one I\u0027ve used in a very long time.\n But you\u0027ve used it before, she replied silently.\n Portals, especially portals like this one, Valas explained, are like waterholes. They attract attention.\n You sense something? she asked.\n Danifae\u0027s own sensitive hearing detected no noise, her equally sensitive nose no smell but her own and the scout\u0027s. That didn\u0027t mean they were alone.\n As if he\u0027d read her mind, Valas replied, You\u0027re never alone in the Underdark. So what is it? she asked. Can we avoid it? Kill it?\n Maybe nothing, he answered in turn, probably not, and I hope so.\n Danifae smiled at him. Valas tipped his head to one side, surprised and confused by the smile.\n Stay here, he signed, and keep still. I\u0027ll go on ahead.\n Danifae looked back along the way they\u0027d come then forward in the direction they were going. The tunnel-twenty-five or thirty feet wide and about as tall-stretched into darkness in both directions.\n If you leave me behind. . . . Danifae threatened with her fingers and with her cold, hard eyes.\n Valas didn\u0027t react at all. He seemed to be waiting for her to finish. Danifae again glanced to the seemingly endless tunnel ahead, only for half a heartbeat. When she turned back, Valas was gone.\n Ryld drew the whetstone slowly along Splitter\u0027s razor edge. The enchanted sword hardly needed sharpening, but Ryld found he was always better able to think when he was performing the simple tasks of a soldier. The sword had no outward signs of an intelligence of its own, but Ryld had convinced himself some years before that Splitter enjoyed the attention he gave it.\n He was alone in the crumbling, weed-choked hovel he shared with Halisstra. The sounds and smells of the forest all around him managed to invade even that personal time with his sword and his thoughts. He knew he was as relaxed as he would ever be on the surface in the daylight under the endless sky-at least, when Halisstra wasn\u0027t with him.\n The Master of Melee-Magthere was alone because he hadn\u0027t been invited to the circle that Halisstra had gone to join. The curious, heretical surface drow were planning something, and Halisstra and her newfound toy-the Crescent Blade-were obviously a big part of it. He had killed the raging animal that attacked him, and as many times as Feliane had tried to explain it to him, he couldn\u0027t imagine why that made him an outcast. Still, Ryld knew he had been left out for more than that one reason.\n He sat alone also because, unlike Halisstra, he had not openly rejected the Spider Queen nor openly embraced her sun-ravaged rival, the Lady of the Dance. Ryld didn\u0027t understand that frivolous goddess of theirs. The Lady of theDance? Were they to set their lives along a path defined by dancing? What sort of a bizarre goddess could draw, much less mete out, power from something so pointless as dancing? Lolth was a cruel and capricious mistress, and her priestesses held her power close, but she was the Queen of Spiders. Spiders were strong, resourceful predators-survivors. Ryld could see himself as a spider. Spiders knew no mercy and never asked for forgiveness. They spun their webs, caught their prey, and lived. Spiders made sense, spiders had power, and power was all any drow needed.\n Apparently not every drow.\n Still, Ryld knew that there was a third reason why he sat sharpening his sword while the females plotted and planned, and that was precisely because he wasn\u0027t a female. In Menzoberranzan, Ryld Argith was a highly regarded and well-respected warrior, a soldier with powerful friends and much to recommend him to his superiors. He led a comfortable life, wielded some items imbued with powerful magic-the greatsword not the least of them-and was even trusted to be a principal member of the vital expedition in search of their silent goddess. Despite all that, Ryld Argith was a male. As such he would never be anything but second, and he well knew likely not even that. He would lead other males, other warriors, but would never command a female. He would be asked his opinion, and that opinion would occasionally even be considered, but he would never make decisions. He would be a soldier-a tool, a weapon-but never a leader. Not in Menzoberranzan among the daughters of Lolth and not in the sun-baked forest among the dancing priestesses.\n Three reasons for being left out, Ryld thought, while at home there is only the third. Three reasons to go home to Menzoberranzan.\n One reason to stay.\n In the past lingering hours of solitude Ryld had thought often of returning to the Underdark. Pharaun and the others would have moved on, continued their quest. Likely they\u0027d all forgotten about the Master of Melee-Magthere who had left the City of Spiders with them. Ryld held no illusions about his worth to the likes of Quenthel Baenre, and Pharaun had at least once proved that Ryld\u0027s life was less important than the wizard\u0027s convenience, let alone the Master of Sorcere\u0027s own well-being.\n Pharaun, however, was predictable. Ryld knew the mage and knew what to expect-even if that meant expecting betrayal. Pharaun was a dark elf, not only well tuned to, but prone to revel in, his drow nature. Quenthel Baenre was the same, which was why they so irritated one another. Those two and the others-even the laconic Valas Hune-were like spiders too: predictable, efficient survivors. Ryld saw himself in the same terms, and being in like company had a compelling draw.\n Until he thought of Halisstra.\n In his years in Menzoberranzan, Ryld had enjoyed the company of more than a handful of females, but like any male in the City of Spiders he knew well enough not to allow attachments to run too deep. He had known from time to time that he was a plaything, a tool, a dalliance, a performer-but never one of those surface elf words, those oddities such as lover, companion, friend, husband.Those words had no meaning until Halisstra.\n Ryld tried and tried, but he couldn\u0027t understand the hold the First Daughter of House Melarn had on him. He had even drawn upon the unique power of Splitter to dispel whatever magic she had cast on him to draw him along with her-but there was no magic. She had cast no spell, sang no bae\u0027qeshel ballad, slipped him no potion to wrap herself around him so tightly. She hadn\u0027t, Ryld mused, even done or said anything too different than things he\u0027d heard before, though in the past such things were said in tones of mockery or even cold, bitter irony by those dozen or more drow females who had had him.\n Halisstra had simply smiled at him, held his gaze with hers, touched him, kissed him, looked at him with fear, longing, regret, pain, anger, desperation . . . looked at him with honesty. Ryld had never seen any of it before, not on the black face of a dark elf, not in the cool gloom of the Underdark. He could feel her when she was close, as if she gave off some ripple that tuned his senses to her. She was simply Halisstra, and the Master of Melee-Magthere was dumbfounded to find that was enough. Her mere presence was sufficient to drag him away from a life that was, and would continue to be, as rewarding as a drow male could expect.\n There he was, putting up with the same things, still the male whose strong sword arm would be called into service on a second\u0027s notice but who would not dine at the same table.\n The fourth reason that he was alone that day and had been alone for much of the day before roared into Ryld\u0027s mind then, and he let it come, but only for a moment.\n They mean to kill her, he thought as a chill raced down his spine and the whetstone that had so slowly and so carefully and so rhythmically been drawn along his blade came to a sudden stop. They mean to kill Lolth.\n Ryld closed his eyes and drew in a long breath, calming his suddenly racing heart.\n It was, after all, why Halisstra had been sent to retrieve the Crescent Blade. It was why the Eilistraeen priestesses put up with the obviously unpleasant presence of the Master of Melee-Magthere-at Halisstra\u0027s demand. It was why Halisstra stayed and why she carried herself with a confidence and composure he hadn\u0027t seen . . . well, never in the outcast from the ruins of Ched Nasad. It was why Halisstra no longer trembled in fear. It was why she woke in the morning and why she drew breath during the day.\n In Eilistraee\u0027s name, Halisstra Melarn meant to murder the Queen of the Demonweb Pits in her sleep.\n Ryld set the whetstone in motion again and smiled.\n Maybe, he thought, she\u0027s more like a spider than she wants to admit.\n Valas held the crystal to his left eye and scanned the chamber. He stood in the deep shadows at the edge of where the tunnel-a very old lava tube-emptied into the pyramidal cavern. The ancient monastery was obvious to even his unaided darkvision. Set against the northern wall of the cathedral-like space off to Valas\u0027s right was a half circle of stone, perhaps seventy-five feet in radius. The curved wall rose as tall as two hundred feet before rounding to a domed roof, with the apex about thirty or forty feet above that. Two huge slit windows, not much wider than Valas was tall but eighty feet in length, were set high on the walls. A thief might have to climb the brick wall for a dangerous hundred feet before being able to slip inside. Between the two tall windows and a few feet below their bottom edges loomed a pair of small, dark holes tall enough that Valas might be able to step through them without dipping his head. Below those round holes a drooping oblong opening led into the pitch-black interior of the ruin.\n The windows, the two round holes, and the oblong opening gave the ruined monastery the look-obviously intentional-of a frowning face.\n Stalactites had formed along the upper edge of the mouth and hung down to form ragged fangs, and dripping water had carried centuries of sediment onto the dome so that a wide patch of smooth white flowstone capped the far end of the great head like some gaily off-kilter hat. What grim ceremonies might have been held before that giant face Valas didn\u0027tbother to imagine. The centuries that had passed since his ancient ancestors had abandoned it had been unkind to the building, but Valas knew that the ravages of dripping water, mold, and earthquakes hadn\u0027t touched the gate that rested inside it. Twice before, though many years gone by, Valas had climbed into that drooping, melancholy mouth and passed between two rune-carved pillars to step two hundred miles to the northwest shore of Lake Thalmiir, an easy walk to Sschindylryn.\n Valas knew he wasn\u0027t the only one who\u0027d used it.\n A crystal normally hung on his vest-an enchanted garment that gave Valas much of his nimble footing and lightning reaction-with many other magical trinkets he\u0027d picked up over a lifetime in the wilds of the Underdark. Through that crystal the scout could see that which others couldn\u0027t-most things rendered invisible by magic either sorcerous or innate.\n Valas slowly andcarefully scanned the base of the great face, then to the left along the still poolof black water that bisected the round floor of the cavern. There was a cave low in the sloping wall across from him and a smaller one-another lava tube of similar dimensions to the one Valas had come through-higher up and to the right. The scout began to scan the roof of the ruined monastery when he heard Danifae all but stomping through the tunnel behind him.\n Valasdidn\u0027t stop his slow, methodical examination of the structure.\n He knew chat Danifae would walk past him, their shoulders close to touching, and she would never see him. He had told her to wait, and if she disregarded his warning it was her choice.\n Let her stomp on in, he thought. Let her- Valas froze when the crystal revealed the tip of what could only be a talon resting on the top of the monastery. Holding his breath, the Bregan D\u0027aerthe scout drew his head back half an inch and played the crystal, still held close to his left eye, along the domed roof of the ancient face.\n The creature that rested atop the ruin wasn\u0027t too big, at least not as far as dragons go. No taller than Valas himself, with a wingspan maybe twice that, the beast was coiled comfortably but alert atop the dome. Though the crystal tended to bleed any color from the scene, Valas knew the monster was as gray in color as it appeared to him through the magic item. Even through the crystal it seemed undefined, blurred as if it had been painted onto the giant face in watercolors.\n That\u0027s how you hide, Valas thought. You blend into the darkness.\n Danifae passed him and strode uncaring to the mouth of the lava tube. She stood for a moment, one hand resting casually on the rock wall, gazing out into the cavern. Valas could tell she hadn\u0027t seen the dragon on the top of the face, but a last quick glimpse through the crystal showed him that the dragon had seen her. It slowly uncoiled itself, drawing up its wings.\n Valas slipped into the cavern, relying in no small part on his own training and experience but not too proud to call on the power of an enchanted ring to speed his way. Mithral chain mail hushed any sound he might make as he moved, and it helped his toes find safe, quiet footing. Keeping always in shadow, always without the slightest scrape of sole on stone, without the faintest reflection of stray light on metal, Valas came down the incline from the mouth of the lava tube and along the bowl-shaped edge of the huge space to the yawning black cave across.\n He risked the occasional glance up at the creature, whose outline he could only barely discern in the gloom high up in the cavern-and only then because he knew it was there. Valas also risked a glance or two back at Danifae, who was slowly, and with surprising grace, making her way down into the bowl of the cavern. She looked all around but not up. Her eyes never rested on either Valas or the stone-gray dragon.\n Danifae walked slowly toward the edge of the pool as Valas drew the shortbow from his back. He nocked an arrow and drew back the string.\n The female was all but offering herself on a silver platter to the beast, and though Valas ached to allow her to see her folly through, he worried about Quenthel. The high priestess seemed to have taken a liking to the Melarn battle-captive, stealing her away without a thought from the female from Ched Nasad. Valas didn\u0027t want to find out the hard way that he\u0027d let the battle-captive die when Quenthel had plans for Danifae beyond their occasional loveplay.\n \"Valas?\" the female called into the dark, still cavern.\n Her voice echoed, Valas cringed, and the dragon took wing.\n Nimor Imphraezl watched from above as the duergar engaged the spiders. Drow warriors-all male-rode the enormous arachnids into battle. The spiders skittered and whirled around them while the riders sat stiff and straight in their saddles. The mounted drow carried long pikes-weapons the duergar were unaccustomed to, as rare as the long weapons were in the confines of the Underdark-and they skewered one after another before the gray dwarves drew any dark elf blood.\n The spider riders were hopelessly outnumbered by the horde of duergar who continued to lay siege to the slowly crumbling city of Menzoberranzan, and Nimor was content to lose a few gray dwarves for the chance to watch the drow fight. They were good, he would grant them that. The spiders killed as many duergar as the pikes did, but the beasts were never out of their riders\u0027 control. All in all it was a beautiful, bloody dance.\n In the center of the spider riders a mounted drow male wearing armor of the finest mithral positively glowed with magic. He carried a pike like the others but hadn\u0027t brought his to bear. He held it up, and from it a long, thin banner wafted in the cool Underdark air. It took Nimor a minute or so to recognize the sigil emblazoned on the banner. The riders represented House Shobalar-a lesser House, but one loyal to the Baenres and known throughout the drow-settled Underdark for their effective and impeccably trained cavalry. The dark elf with the banner must be their leader.\n One of the riders took two duergar at once, pinning them together then using their weight at the end of his pike to topple three more of their companions onto the flowstone floor. Nimor smiled.\n He had come to that particular tunnel after hearing three separate times of unusual activity there. The duergar had managed to kill a Menzoberranyr scout only a day before, and even the gruff gray dwarves had admitted that other drow had been there and gotten away. It wasn\u0027t the most well defended approach, and Nimor had been keeping an eye on it, certain the Menzoberranyr would be testing it.\n When the scout was killed, Nimor had Crown Prince Horgar send reinforcements, but only a few. Enough, Nimor hoped, to satisfy the drow but not enough to close the approach. Nimor wanted to draw them out, and like the arrogant aristocrats they were, they\u0027d taken the bait.\n Nimor hung upside down, hidden by a spell of invisibility, his piwafwi, another spell that prevented anyone using similar magic from finding him, and another that would draw enemies\u0027 attention away even if they thought to look up at him. Those things and the immediate threat of the duergar soldiers were enough that he could wait and watch in peace-wait and watch for the spider rider captain to send his arachnid mount scurrying into the fray, scurrying right under Nimor. With a touch to a brooch that bore the sign of the Jaezred Chaulssin, Nimor dropped slowly, still hidden from sight by magic. As he descended, Nimor drew his dagger-a very special dagger-and when he came to rest on the spider, inches behind the cavalry leader, he flicked the blade across the back of the drow warrior\u0027s neck. There was a perfect space there between his helm and his pauldron.\n The spider rider flinched and turned in his saddle. Nimor, still invisible, grabbed the drow around his neck and held the poisoned blade to his throat. The spider rider couldn\u0027t see him, but he could hear Nimor whisper in his ear, \"What is your name, Shobalar?\"\n \"Who are you?\" the warrior asked, and Nimor cut him again-not too deeply-in response.\n The drow grunted, and Nimor could feel his body stiffen, jerk, and quiver. \"Yes,\" Nimor hissed into the slowly dying officer\u0027s ear, \"it is poison. Very, very elegant poison. It will paralyze you, twist your throat closed, squeeze the last gasp of air from your lungs, and keep you from screaming while you suffocate.\"\n The drow growled and said, his voice already quiet and tight, \"My House will avenge me.\"\n \"Your House will burn, Captain . . . ?\"\n \"Vilto\u0027sat Shobalar,\" the drow answered even as his throat squeezed shut, \"of the Spider Riders of House Sh-\"\n Smiling all the while, Nimor held the dying drow upright in his saddle as he suffocated. The Anointed Blade of the Jaezred Chaulssin waited until Captain Vilto\u0027sat Shobalar quivered through his last attempt at a breath and his magenta eyes glazed over. Then Nimor levitated up and away from the suddenly uncontrolled, feral war-spider.\n The arachnid went berserk, chewing through duergar after duergar then turning on another of its kind. The rider of that spider turned his attention to protecting his mount from the wild arachnid-just long enough for a particularly enthusiastic duergar footman to take his head with a poleaxe.\n Nimor killed eight more drow himself over the next ten minutes or so, while the duergar claimed three. The rest finally turned and ran back through the tunnel, past the outer siege line and back into Menzoberranzan. They had taken back nothing, and Nimor had four of their spiders and the dead drow.\n Nimor ordered up more duergar to resecure the position, had the spiders bound and made ready for travel, and went back to his command post with the corpse of Captain Vilto\u0027sat Shobalar.\n Spoils of war. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/annihilation-war-of-the-spider-queen-5/page-5.html","bookId":2163,"book":{"id":2163,"title":"Annihilation (War of the Spider Queen #5)","description":"Storyline: \n Annihilation: War of the Spider Queen, Book V (R.A Salvatore Presents the War of the Spider Queen) \n The fifth title in the New York Times best-selling saga of civil war and chaos in the darkest part of the Forgotten Realms setting.
