{"id":97673,"no":25,"title":"Page 25","content":"Inside the temple walls was a city twenty times the size of Menzoberranzan. Like the walls and the surrounding plazas, the city was a battered, war-ravaged ruin that looked to Pharaun as if it had been abandoned for a thousand years or more.\\n\\n The architecture throughout mimicked all manner of dark elven dwellings, from the calcified webs of Ched Nasad to the hollowed-out stalagmites of Menzoberranzan. The only thing the structures had in common was that they were all at least partially collapsed and they were devoid of life.\\n\\n Valas appeared behind the mage as he always did, as if by magic. Pharaun didn\u0027t bother trying to pretend the scout\u0027s sudden appearance hadn\u0027t startled him. The time for keeping up appearances and jockeying for position in the party had come and gone.\\n\\n Valas nodded once to the Master of Sorcere and said, \"There\u0027s more metal the deeper in we go.\"\\n\\n Pharaun found himself shaking his head, unsure at first what the scout was trying to tell him. He looked around more closely and saw that Valas was right. Though they had seen jagged, twisted chunks of rusted iron and scorched steel in the plaza outside, the deeper into the temple they walked, the more they all had to step around larger and larger pieces.\\n\\n Valas stopped and reached out to touch a gently curving wall of steel three times the scout\u0027s height.\\n\\n \"It looks like it was ripped off of a larger piece,\" the scout said. \"I\u0027ve never seen this much steel.\"\\n\\n Pharaun nodded, examining the relic from a distance.\\n\\n \"It looks like a piece of a giant\u0027s suit of armor,\" the wizard commented, \"a giant bigger than any you might find on the World Above, but this is the Abyss, Valas. There could be such a creature here.\"\\n\\n \"Or a god,\" the scout replied.\\n\\n \"Selvetarm was that big,\" Danifae said. Both the males turned to look at her, surprised that she\u0027d stopped to join the conversation. The former battle-captive had been walking in silence with the draegloth never far from her side, apparently unfazed by her surroundings. \"So was Vhaeraun.\"\\n\\n Valas nodded and said, \"There are other pieces, though, and there are things that don\u0027t look like armor.\"\\n\\n \"The mechanical bits,\" Pharaun interjected. \"I\u0027ve noticed those too.\"\\n\\n \"Mechanical bits?\" the young priestess asked.\\n\\n Pharaun continued walking as he said,\"The odd moving part. I\u0027ve seen hinges and things that seem to act almost like a joint, like a shoulder or knee joint in a drow\u0027s body but with wires or other contraptions in place of muscles.\"\\n\\n \"Now that you mention it,\" Valas said, \"some of them did look like legs or arms.\"\\n\\n \"Who cares?\" the draegloth grumbled. \"Are you two really wasting your time examining the garbage? Do you have no understanding of what\u0027s happened here?\" \"I think we have at least a rudimentary understanding of what\u0027s gone on here, Jeggred, yes,\" Pharaun said. \"By \u0027examining the garbage,\u0027 as you so eloquently put it, we might gain some understanding beyond the point where it can still be described as rudimentary. Alas, that\u0027s not a state of mind with which you tend to be familiar with yourself, but those of us with higher-\"\\n\\n The air was forced out of Pharaun\u0027s lungs in a single painful grunt. The draegloth was on top of him, smashing him into a crumbling pile of bricks that had once been part of a soaring cathedral. The wizard brought to mind a spell that didn\u0027t require speech but stopped himself from casting it when Danifae\u0027s voice echoed across the temple grounds.\\n\\n \"Jeggred,\" she commanded, \"leave it.\"\\n\\n It was a command someone might give a pet rat distracted by a cave beetle. As the draegloth withdrew and Pharaun struggled to his feet, he wondered which was a greater insult, Jeggred smashing him to the ground or Danifae\u0027s rude remark. The Master of Sorcere brushed off his piwafwi, did his best with the wild mop his hair had become, and cleared his throat.\\n\\n \"Ah, Jeggred, my boy,\" thewizard said, letting the sarcasm drip freely, \"was it something I said?\"\\n\\n \"Next time you talk to me like that, mage,\" he draegloth growled, \"your heart will follow Ryld Argith\u0027s through my bowels.\"\\n\\n Pharaun tried not to laugh and said, \"Charming as always.\"\\n\\n \"Come, Jeggred,\" Danifae said, waving the draegloth into step behind her.\\n\\n Pharaun finished assembling himself, and as he was about to move on he stopped and turned, having caught someone looking at him from the corner of his eye. Quenthel Baenre stood partially blocked by another huge, jagged hunk of steel. The look the wizard saw on her face was ice cold, and if they had been back in Menzoberranzan it would surely have presaged Danifae\u0027s death.\\n\\n After the echoes from Dyrr\u0027s last, barely-coherent shout finally died away, came a moment of almost complete silence. The lich hung in the still air, trembling with rage. Gromph took a moment to survey the ruined Bazaar.\\n\\n The fires had burned themselves out, and the smoke slowly dissipated. Dozens of stalls, tents, and carts were ruined-burned or shattered. Great cracks and pits had been dug into the stone floor, which was scorched in large swaths of dusty black.\\n\\n A few whispered words drifted across the otherwise quiet space, and Gromph saw a few inquisitive-and unwise-drow beginning to wander into the edges of the ruined marketplace. They had sensed that the duel had come to an end, but Gromph knew how wrong they were. Something, and it wasn\u0027t only Gromph\u0027s ability to outthink him, had scared Nimor off, had given the Anointed Blade the impression that he had lost.\\n\\n Why did Nimor abandon the fight, Archmage? Nauzhror asked. What does he know? Find out, Gromph ordered then turned his attention to Dyrr.\\n\\n \"We can finish this now, if you like,\" Gromph said.\\n\\n The lich took a deep, shuddering breath and shook his head.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s as it should be,\" the archmage added.\\n\\n \"I suppose it is, my young friend,\" the lich answered, his voice steady. \"You, the highest ranking wizard in Menzoberranzan, and me, the most powerful. It\u0027s only symmetrical that we eventually face each other. Power abhors that sort of imbalance.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" Gromph answered with a shrug. \"I don\u0027t consider balance. I worship a demon. I serve chaos.\"\\n\\n Dyrr\u0027s answer was to begin casting a spell. Gromph stepped back and used his staff to levitate, hopping a dozen feet up into the air and hovering there. He looked down and could see a small group of drow-fifteen or twenty and mostly older males-begin sifting through the ruined stalls. They must have been the merchants themselves, finally unable to stay away, not knowing the fate of their livelihoods.\\n\\n Gromph thought to warn them off but didn\u0027t. He didn\u0027t want to.\\n\\n Dyrr finished his spell, and at first it looked as if the lich burst. He grew, ballooning up to twice, then three, then four times his normal size and bigger. He changed in every conceivable physical way and dropped from the air with a resounding crash that made the merchants scatter back past the edges of the Bazaar. Gromph watched the bystanders gape in awe and fear at what Dyrr had become.\\n\\n It\u0027s a gigant, Nauzhror said. A blackstone gigant.\\n\\n Gromph sighed. He knew what it was that Dyrr had turned himself into.\\n\\n Under normal circumstances, a blackstone gigant was a construct, created by priestesses of any number of dark faiths to be used as servants, guardians, assassins, or instruments of war. Carved from solid blocks of stone, they were formidable creatures that could destroy a whole city if left unchecked. What Dyrr had done was change his form from his normally thin, aged drow frame to the form of a gigant. In the process he had become, for all intents and purposes, that new creature.\\n\\n The gigant was easily forty feet long from the top of its massive, drowlike head to the tip of its curling, wormlike tail. It had four sets of long arms with drowlike hands big enough to close over Gromph entirely, though the hands were oddly twisted with three multi-jointed fingers ending in black talons not unlike Nimor\u0027s. The lich had opted to retain his black coloration, but the creature\u0027s eyes blazed a bright blue. Shafts of light extended from them, cutting through the haze of smoke that still hung in the air. It opened its mouth and revealed fangs the size of short swords, set in rows. Slime dripped from its twisted lower lip. It was in constant motion, twitching and squirming like a maggot. The weight of it dragged ragged scars in the floor, and the sound of grinding, cracking stone overwhelmed all other sounds.\\n\\n The creature started to destroy everything it could reach, and it could reach a lot. What merchants\u0027 stalls were still intact and unburned were ground to splinters under the colossal beast\u0027s raw tonnage. The once curious merchants ran for their lives, but as the gigant writhed across the Bazaar, it rolled over one fleeing drow after another. When it rolled on to reveal them once again, instead of the mass of unrecognizable paste Gromph expected to see, there was left behind an array of what looked at first like statues. The petrified forms of a score of drow lay perfectly still, scattered across the ruined Bazaar. The touch of the gigant had turned them to stone.\\n\\n Its fit of destructive rage finished, the gigant turned its attention to Gromph. The shafts of light from its eyes fell on the archmage, illuminating him where he hovered a dozen yards above the floor of the Bazaar.\\n\\n Gromph cast a spell as the gigant came at him, gnashing its massive fangs and petrifying a handful more of the careless drow merchants. The spell made Gromph difficult to see. His form became cloudy, indistinct, and he dropped quickly to the ground. The boots he was wearing would help him run faster than any drow. Difficult to see and moving fast, Gromph managed to stay out of the raging gigant\u0027s way.\\n\\n \"Can you hear me, Dyrr?\" Gromph called out.\\n\\n The lich didn\u0027t answer. Gromph wasn\u0027t sure if he could in his current state. The gigant growled and gnashed its teeth and came at him again. Gromph literally ran in circles in an effort to contain the dangerous beast in the Bazaar. Any living thing it touched turned to stone, and too many Menzoberranyr had perished already. If the siege truly was coming to an end, it was time for the wasteful killing to stop too.\\n\\n \"Dyrr, answer me,\" Gromph tried again, but again there was no response.\\n\\n Instead, the gigant glanced down at the petrified drow left in its wake. When the beam of light from its eyes played on their stone forms, the rock-hard drow lurched into motion. The petrified merchants drew themselves up, staggering slowly like zombies, and each one turned its head up to regard the gigant as if listening for orders. Dust fell from them in gently wafting clouds.\\n\\n The gigant hissed at each of them, and as it did so one after another of the animated statues turned to face Gromph and began to stagger slowly toward him. Gromph could move many times faster than the petrified drow, but there were a lot of them: a dozen, then more, and he knew that eventually he would have to do something about the blackstone gigant and its cadre of animatedstatues in the heart of Menzoberranzan.\\n\\n The lich isn\u0027t answering you, Master, Nauzhror said. Perhaps he can\u0027t. Perhaps he\u0027s more gigant now than lich.\\n\\n What does that mean? Prath asked.\\n\\n It means, Gromph answered, that what a lich might be normally capable of, normally resistant to, may no longer apply.\\n\\n Like what? Prath asked.\\n\\n Gromph and Nauzhror projected the same word at precisely the same time: Necromancy,\"That\u0027s impossible,\" Valas said. \"It\u0027s the size of a castle.\"\\n\\n Pharaun shrugged, nodding, looking up at the enormous wreck.\\n\\n \"Bigger,\" the Master of Sorcere replied, \"but it walked.\"\\n\\n The wreck was once a sphere of polished steel three hundred feet or more in diameter. It lay amid the ruins of half a dozen smaller stone and web buildings, one side of it gone completely. On the whole it resembled a discarded eggshell, but in fact it had once been a walking fortress. Pharaun tried to imagine the sight of the thing intact, standing on legs that were left bent and torn underneath its bulk.\\n\\n \"Some kind of clockwork contraption,\" Valas persisted, \"that big ... It would have to have been built by a . . .\"\\n\\n \"A god?\" Pharaun finished for him, when he sensed Valas hesitating to draw the same conclusion. \"Or in this case a goddess. Why not?\"\\n\\n \"What would you use something like that for?\" asked Danifae.\\n\\n \"War,\" Jeggred offered, though there was enough of a lilt in his voice to make it almost sound like a question. \"It\u0027s a war machine.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a fortress,\" Quenthel said. There was a finality, a certainty in her voice that made the others turn to look at her. \"It\u0027s... it was Lolth\u0027s own fortress. It once resembled a clockwork spider, and from within Lolth herself could traverse the Demonweb Pits, protected and armed with weapons the likes of which no drow has yet imagined.\"\\n\\n \"I think . . .\" Danifae said. \"I think I remember reading something about that but always thought it a fantasy, a bit of harmless heresy to thrill the uninitiated.\"\\n\\n \"You know this for sure?\" Pharaun asked Quenthel, though he could see in her face that she had no doubts.\\n\\n The high priestess looked the Master of Sorcere in the eye and said, \"I\u0027ve been inside it. I\u0027ve seen it move. It was inside that spider fortress that I first came before the Spider Queen herself.\"\\n\\n Pharaun turned from Quenthel\u0027s gaze to look at the massive wreck again.\\n\\n \"She seldom left its confines,\" Quenthel went on, her voice growing softer and softer as if she were receding over a great distance. \"I don\u0027t think I ever saw her leave it, in fact, in all the years I...\"\\n\\n Pharaun didn\u0027t turn back to look at the Mistress of Arach-Tinilith when he said, \"We should go inside. If Lolth never left that fortress, perhaps she\u0027s still in there.\"\\n\\n \"She isn\u0027t there,\" Quenthel said.\\n\\n \"The mistress is right,\" said Danifae. \"I can feel it-or, rather, I can\u0027t feel her.\"\\n\\n \"She might still be inside there,\" the wizard said, knowing that he was taking his life in his own hands again by suggesting the possibility-even though he was sure each one of them had at least briefly considered it. \"Her body might be, anyway.\"\\n\\n No one said anything in response, but they did follow when Pharaun began the long walk to the fallen spider fortress.\\n\\n As minutes dragged, the walk grew increasingly difficult. Fatigue had long since made itself known, and though they occasionally stopped to eat and drink from the supplies that Valas had given each of them from his dimensional containers they were all hungry, thirsty, and ready to drop. That, coupled with an increasing denseness in debris and intervening walls of stone, web, bricks, or steel, reduced their speed to a quarter of what they hoped for.\\n\\n Still, the draegloth managed to get close to Pharaun\u0027s side. The mage was reasonably confident that the defenses he already had running would prevent the half-demon from taking him down before he could defend himself, so he didn\u0027t stop and challenge the draegloth.\\n\\n \"You would like it,\" Jeggred whispered to Pharaun. The draegloth\u0027s whisper was as loud as a drow\u0027s normal volume, but still no one seemed to have heard him. \"If Lolth is dead in there and all we find is a skeleton, you\u0027d be happy. Admit it.\"\\n\\n \"I admit nothing,\" the Master of Sorcere replied. \"As a matter of policy, actually. Still, in this case I truly hope we don\u0027t find Lolth dead in there. If I did, what would you care anyway, draegloth? Would you run and tell your mistress on me? Which of your two mistresses would you tell first? Or would you even tell Quenthel at all? Honestly, Jeggred, you\u0027re acting as if you expect never to see Menzoberranzan again.\"\\n\\n \"Am I?\" the draegloth asked. He was fundamentally incapable of sarcasm. \"How so?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re ignoring the wishes of Quenthel Baenre-\" the wizard stressed that House name-\"in favor of the whims of a servant. Here, in the very heart of Lolth\u0027s power.\"\\n\\n \"Danifae is a servant no longer,\" the draegloth said. \"I have seen many-\"\\n\\n Fire.\\n\\n The word formed in Pharaun\u0027s mind even as his skin blistered and his clothing threatened to catch. The flames came at them in a wave, engulfing all five of them in blinding tongues of orange, red, and blue. Pharaun could hear his defensive spells crackling to hold out the heat, and though he was still burned, he survived it. Not all of the others were in as good shape, though, and Pharaun immediately searched his mind for a spell that would protect them all-and if not them all then Valas, Quenthel (she was the sister of the archmage, after all), Danifae, and Jeggred ... in that order.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t have a chance to bring any spell to mind, though, before another wall of fire passed him, burning him even worse as it went.\\n\\n Foul, coughing laughter echoed down from above, and Pharaun looked up to see a vicious tanar\u0027ri hanging, by dint of at least some simple magic, in midair above them. The thing was like some kind of mad, twisted bull, and it lacked feet.\\n\\n Pharaun recognized it at once, even as he was conjuring a sphere of Weave energy around himself to protect him from certain spells. The tanar\u0027ri was a glabrezu, and it looked familiar.\\n\\n \"The ice . . .\" Danifae suggested, her voice hissingthrough clenched teeth. Danifae and Quenthel bore shiny patches on their black skin. They had been burned worse than Pharaun but not quite enough to raise blisters. Quenthel drew the healing wand and lost no time passing it over her own skin.\\n\\n \"I had it trapped in ice,\" said Pharaun, \"and left it there.\"\\n\\n The mage glanced quickly around for Valas, but the scout was nowhere to be seen.\\n\\n \"Typical demon,\" Quenthel mumbled. \"Chewed its own legs off to get out of there.\"\\n\\n Jeggred roared with rage. Smoke rose from his singed fur in black-gray wisps. \"You followed us all the way here, Belshazu?\" the Mistress of Arach-Tinilith asked. \"So we could kill you?\"\\n\\n \"Quite the opposite,\" said Jeggred\u0027s father.\\n\\n Halisstra Melarn was flying.\\n\\n Though that wasn\u0027t an entirely accurate description of what was happening to her, it was what all her senses told her. Below her stretched an eternity of gray nothing punctuated by swirling storms of color and distant chunks of drifting, turning rock as big around as a mile and as small as a single drow. Above her and to every side was precisely the same thing.\\n\\n She had recently visited the Astral Plane with the party of Menzoberranyr and her former battle-captive, but that had been a very different experience. At that time, under the care of a priest of Vhaeraun, she\u0027d felt like a ghost being pulled along by a chain. Through the power of Eilistraee, however, she was actually in the Astral, not projected there, and there was nothing anchoring her to the plane of her birth.\\n\\n Halisstra Melarn felt more free than she\u0027d ever felt before. Her lips turned up into an unashamed smile, and her heart raced. Her hair blew out behind her though there wasn\u0027t technically any wind. Her body responded to a mere thought in the aether medium of the Astral Plane, and she soared and swooped like a darkenbeast at play.\\n\\n The only restraint she felt was the need to keep close to her companions, Uluyara and Feliane. Halisstra could see that the surface elf and the drow priestess were enjoying their flight through the Astral as much as she was, and both of them shared her smile. Still, the gravity of the mission that brought them there was never far from their minds.\\n\\n Halisstra had risked everything and lost everything to be there. Ryld was surely dead, as dead as Ched Nasad, and any life she might ever have had in the Underdark was behind her. Ahead was uncertainty but acceptance. Ahead was risk but at least the potential for reward, where all she left behind was hopelessness.\\n\\n \"There!\" Uluyara called to her fellow travelers, breaking into Halisstra\u0027s thoughts. \"Do you see?\"\\n\\n Halisstra followed the other priestess\u0027s black-skinned finger, and found her body shifting in the \"air\" to begin flying in that same direction. Uluyara was indicating a long line of dull black shadows, and Halisstra had to blink several times before she began to understand what she was seeing. It was as if she were looking at a vast gray screen behind which, like actors in a shadow play, a line of drow were slowly drifting toward a common goal.\\n\\n \"Approach them slowly,\" Feliane warned. \"They may not even be able to sense our presence, but we don\u0027t know for sure, and there are so many of them.\"\\n\\n \"Who are they?\" Halisstra asked, though even as the last word left her mouth she realized what she was seeing.\\n\\n \"The damned,\" was Uluyara\u0027s whispered, heavy reply.\\n\\n \"So many . ..\" Halisstra whispered in the same stunned monotone.\\n\\n \"All the drow who died while Lolth was silent, I would suppose,\" said Feliane. \"Where are they going?\"\\n\\n \"Not to the Abyss,\" Uluyara replied.\\n\\n As they came closer and closer Halisstra couldn\u0027t help but pick out faces among the slowly drifting forms of the recently deceased. All of the dark elves appeared uniformly gray, as if they were merely charcoal renderings and not real drow. When she looked directly at one of them, a female probably too young for the Blooding, Halisstra could see right through her to the spinning rock that was passing behind.\\n\\n One of the shades noticed her and briefly made eye contact, but the departed soul didn\u0027t slow in its progress or make any move to speak to her.\\n\\n \"Where are they going?\" Halisstra asked, seeing first one, then another of the ghosts wearing a symbol of Lolth or other trinkets and heraldry that showed them as devotees of the Spider Queen. \"If not the Abyss, if not to Lolth\u0027s domain, then where?\"\\n\\n Hope leaped in Halisstra\u0027s chest. If the dead among her loyal followers weren\u0027t going to Lolth\u0027s side but were going somewhere, perhaps there was some hope for a follower of the Spider Queen besides oblivion.\\n\\n \"Eilistraee\u0027s own spell,\" said Feliane, \"was drawing us to the Abyss, and we weren\u0027t going this way.\"\\n\\n \"When I was in the Demonweb Pits with the Baenre sister and the others,\" Halisstra recounted, \"we saw no souls such as these. Quenthel remarked on their absence. The sixty-sixth layer held only hordes of feral demons, two warring gods, and a sealed-off temple.\"\\n\\n \"Should we follow them?\" Feliane asked Uluyara. \"If they are Lolth\u0027s followers, they might be moving toward her, even if they aren\u0027t moving toward the Abyss.\" \"Could Lolth have abandoned the Abyss itself?\" Halisstra asked.\\n\\n Both Halisstra and Feliane looked to Uluyara for answers, but the drow priestess only shrugged.\\n\\n Halisstra willed herself closer to the line of souls and watched them go by, waiting for an older priestess to pass, someone who looked as if she might have some insight. As the dead filed past her, Halisstra saw mostly males, warriors obviously, and a few driders in the mix. From their costumes and heraldry, Halisstra could tell that the drow came from a number of cities spread across the length and breadth of the Underdark.\\n\\n Finally, a priestess approached whom she thought looked suitable, and Halisstra drifted closer still. She reached out her hand to touch the passing soul, when someone called to her.\\n\\n Halisstra, the voice said, echoing directly into her mind.\\n\\n Halisstra blinked and slapped her hands to her head. She was only dimly aware of Uluyara and Feliane asking after her condition.\\n\\n The sound of the psychic voice echoed in her skull, the gravity of it pushing all other thoughts away.\\n\\n \"Ryld. . ..\" she said through a jaw tight and quivering.\\n\\n I\u0027m here, the Master of Melee-Magthere whispered into her consciousness. Halisstra opened her eyes and was face to face with the ghostly shadow of Ryld Argith. The drow warrior stood tall and proud in his shadowy armor, his hands at once reaching out for her and pushing her away. Tears burst from her eyes, blurring her vision of her lover\u0027s disembodied soul.\\n\\n I loved you, he said.\\n\\n Halisstra had been trying not to cry, but with those three words she broke into body-racking sobs that sent her drifting slowly away from him in the Astral aether. She wanted to say a hundred things to him, but her throat closed, her jaw clenched, and her head throbbed.\\n\\n I gave up everything for you, he said.\\n\\n \"Ryld,\" Halisstra managed finally to say. \"I can bring you-\"\\n\\n He didn\u0027t so much say \"no\" as he imparted that feeling into her consciousness. Halisstra gasped for air.\\n\\n I go to Lolth now, said Ryld. I don\u0027t belong with Eilistraee, even if I belonged with you.\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t choose her over you, Ryld,\" Halisstra said, though she knew she was lying. \"I would have turned away from her if you\u0027d asked me to.\"\\n\\n Again, the feeling of \"no.\"\\n\\n \"I wanted you,\" she whispered.\\n\\n You had me, he said, for as long as you could.\\n\\n \"Halisstra,\" Uluyara whispered into her ear. Halisstra realized that the other drow priestess was holding her arm. \"Halisstra, ask him where he\u0027s going. Ask him where Lolth has gone.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s going to her,\" Halisstra said to Uluyara, then to Ryld: \"I love you.\" She blinked back her tears in time to see him smile and nod.\\n\\n \"To Lolth?\" asked Uluyara. \"Where is she?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s why we\u0027re here now, isn\u0027t it?\" Halisstra asked the slowly drifting soul of Ryld Argith. \"Because we loved each other.\"\\n\\n Because we left our world behind, he said. Because we left ourselves there. You were able to create a new Halisstra, but I was not able to make a new Ryld. I\u0027m here because I deserve to be. If not, the draegloth could never have beaten me. \"And we would still be together,\" she said.\\n\\n Tell your friends, he said, that Lolth has taken the Demonweb Pits out of the Abyss. We have been waiting, some of us for months, to feel her pull us across the Astral to her, and only now are we compelled so.\\n\\n \"Lolth,\" Halisstra said to the other priestesses, her voice tight with regret, anger, hate, and too much more to bear, \"is bringing them home.\"\\n\\n \"The Demonweb Pits is no longer part of the Abyss,\" Uluyara guessed.\\n\\n She\u0027s changing, Ryld said and his thoughts had the feel of a warning. She\u0027s changing everything.\\n\\n Halisstra felt Uluyara\u0027s grip on her arm tighten, and the priestess whispered to her, \"Let him go. There is only one way to serve him now.\"\\n\\n \"W-we can bring him . . . bring him back,\" Halisstra stuttered, watching Ryld turn from her and driftslowly away with the other uncaring shades.\\n\\n \"Not if he doesn\u0027t want to go back,\" Uluyara whispered, and the hand on her arm slipped into a snug embrace.\\n\\n Halisstra wrapped her arms around Uluyara and wept as Ryld dwindled from sight farther and farther along the line of the damned. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/annihilation-war-of-the-spider-queen-5/page-25.html","bookId":2163,"book":{"id":2163,"title":"Annihilation (War of the Spider Queen #5)","description":"Storyline: Annihilation: War of the Spider Queen, Book V (R.A Salvatore Presents the War of the Spider Queen) \\n The fifth title in the New York Times best-selling saga of civil war and chaos in the darkest part of the Forgotten Realms setting.
