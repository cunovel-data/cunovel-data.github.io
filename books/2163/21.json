{"id":97669,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"Piet squeezed the handle of hisaxe, hoping that his sweating palms would still be able to grip it when the fighting started-and the fighting would start soon. He glanced at his friend Ulo and could tell that Ulo was thinking the same thing. Piet could even see Ulo\u0027s fingers worrying at the handles of his two big knives, and he knew that Ulo\u0027s hands were sweating too.\\n\\n They had come to the Flooded Forest to do some logging, make a couple of silvers, and mind their own business. Since they\u0027d been there they\u0027d seen ten of their comrades killed. Some had died in the inevitable accidents that one might expect at any logging camp, but most of them fell to the local wildlife. The swamp held all manner of arcane threats, from animated vines that dragged men down to a watery grave to lizardfolk who picked off stragglers at the edges of the clearing seemingly out of spite. Still, the ring of torches and the gods only knew what else-maybe even some sort of swamp etiquette-kept the really dangerous creatures out of their camp. The makeshift tavern where the men spent virtually all of their non-working time (and there wasn\u0027t much of that) seemed like a safe enough place.\\n\\n Now a dark elf and some kind of huge demon-thing had smashed through the window, and all bets were off.\\n\\n Piet and Ulo faced off against the dark elf. Of the two of them, he appeared merely lethal, where the demon-thing might have really done terrible things to someone. Piet\u0027s knees were shaking. So were his hands, and his jaw felt tense. On the other side of the common room four of the other loggers, Ansen, Kinsky, Lint, and Arkam, were facing down the huge demon-thing. They were all armed-no one with half a brain went unarmed in the Flooded Forest-but their weapons looked puny against the massive creature. Ansen had grabbed a torch from a wall sconce, Kinsky had his axe with him, Lint was hoping to keep the monster at bay with the spear he used to fish in the swamp, and Arkam waved a broken axe handle in front of him. They all looked suitably terrified.\\n\\n The dark elf had a huge sword-Piet had never seen a sword so big-but he was holding it in a loose grip, dangling to his right, the tip scraping the rough wood floor. The drow was wet and bleeding from his face, from his leg, and maybe other places as well. Piet had never seen a dark elf before. He\u0027d actually always thought they were a myth, so it was impossible for him to get a read on the creature, but he seemed to be weak, exhausted, maybe even dying.\\n\\n \"Who are you?\" Piet asked, not liking at all the terrified quaver he heard in his voice. \"What are you doing here? What do you want?\"\\n\\n Difficult as it was for Piet to tell what the drow was thinking, the logger was convinced that the outsider understood him. The look he gave Piet in answer seemed haughty at first then wasn\u0027t so much haughty as ... Piet didn\u0027t know what to call it. He thought he remembered a word: disdainful, but he wasn\u0027t sure he remembered what that meant.\\n\\n The drow didn\u0027t answer. Instead, he started to bring his sword up, and Piet, afraid the drow was going to cut him, chopped down with his axe. Piet had spent his entire adult life-since he was eleven-and-a-half-chopping wood. He knew how to swing an axe, and he did it with speed, power, and precision. Still, he didn\u0027t come within an armslength of the dark elf.\\n\\n Piet barely saw him move. He was a couple of feet to the right all of a sudden, standing between Piet and Ulo. The drow had his sword up, but it looked as if he was defending himself, not attacking. Ulo, surprised that the dark elf was suddenly standing so much closer to him, waved his knives in front of himself madly-cutting no one-and scrambled backward until he hit the wall.\\n\\n \"Stab him, Ulo!\" Piet shouted, but it didn\u0027tlook as if Ulo even heard him. The dark elf came at Piet with his sword low, and Piet dodged out of the way instinctively. A rush of adrenaline coursed through him. He\u0027d never moved so fast in his life.\\n\\n He changed his grip on his axe and swung it sideways at the dark elf, who leaped back to let the axe head pass a few inches in front of his face. Piet reversed his grip at the end of the swing, twisted the axe around and swung again. He knew the dark elf would lean back again and was ready for it. He actually aimed at a point several inches behind the drow\u0027s head. The only thing he could see was the drow, and when the axe came at the dark elf\u0027s head, Piet closed his eyes, expecting a splash of blood.\\n\\n The axe stopped, and hot, thick liquid splashed over Piet\u0027s face. He closed his eyes tighter to keep the blood out of his eyes and tried to wrench the axe out of the dark elf\u0027s skull, but it was stuck. The falling body dragged Piet down with in and he slowly sank to his knees. Piet\u0027s forehead bumped the wall, which surprised him. He didn\u0027t think he was that far forward.\\n\\n He wiped his eyes with one sleeve as he said, \"I got him, Ulo! I split the black devil\u0027s sku-\"\\n\\n Piet stopped cold when he opened his eyes and saw exactly whose skull he\u0027d split. Ulo\u0027s dead eyes stared back at him, glassy and vacant. Piet\u0027s axe head was jammed into the side of his friend\u0027s head, and blood was still oozing out from around it.\\n\\n Piet\u0027s body shook, wracked by a spasm, but he kept himself from vomiting by pressing a hand tightly to his mouth, letting go of the axe that was still stuck in his friend\u0027s head, and rolling off onto the floor.\\n\\n He looked up and saw the dark elf looking down at him, making no move to kill him, though the drow would have had an easy time of it. Piet met the black creature\u0027s gaze and got the sinking feeling that the drow was not only pleased with himself for getting Piet to kill Ulo but that he was thinking about trying something like it again.\\n\\n \"Men!\" Piet barked, his voice cracking.\\n\\n He wanted to warn them, but his throat was tight, and he had trouble forcing the words out. Looking up at the other four loggers, Piet saw the huge, gray-furred demon rip Arkam\u0027s throat out with one hand, as if he were digging a handful of shortening out of a pot. Blood poured out everywhere, and Arkam was dead before his gore-soaked body hit the floor.\\n\\n Piet knew the second the two bizarre creatures burst in through the window that things were going to end badly for the logging crew, but there was something about the way matters were unfolding-the casual manner in which the gray demon ripped Arkam\u0027s throat out and the conniving, almost mean-spirited way the dark elf made Piet kill his own friend-that made it seem too personal, as if they\u0027d come there for that reason.\\n\\n Piet\u0027s palms weren\u0027t sweating anymore. His jaw was still tight, but for a different reason. His blood pounded in his ears. The dark elf was watching the demon toy with Ansen, Kinsky, and Lint. He didn\u0027t even think Piet was dangerous enough to keep an eye on.\\n\\n That, Piet thought, is your second and last mistake, drow.\\n\\n Piet coughed back the bile that rose in his throat when he put his heavy-booted foot on his friend Ulo\u0027s split-open head and pushed while pulling on the axe handle. The axe head came loose with a nauseating sucking sound, but Piet managed to ignore it.\\n\\n Axe in hand, Piet stood then lunged at the dark elf. The slippery drow dodged him again, quickly and easily enough that Piet thought he must have eyes on the back of his head. Undaunted, the logger swung again but sliced through nothing but air. The drow danced back, not even parrying with his huge greatsword, just stepping back, leaning toeither side or backward as Piet swung again and again.\\n\\n Piet finally gave up. His lungs were burning. He tried to speak but couldn\u0027t. He wanted to run but his legs felt like twigs ready to snap-he\u0027d already spent a long day cutting down trees. All he could do was stand there and watch the dark elf watch the demon-thing kill the rest of the men in the room.\\n\\n The demon had one of the heavy oak tables in his hands-the larger two of the thing\u0027s three hands-and was pressing Ansen, Kinsky, and Lint into the wall. Their weapons were caught between the tabletop and their own bodies. Ansen\u0027s torch burned his face, Kinsky\u0027s axe handle cracked his collarbone, and Lint\u0027s spear wagged impotently from behind the table, digging deep furrows into the roof beam above him.\\n\\n The men were grunting and coughing. Ansen screamed. Smoke billowed up from his hair, and the flesh around his right eye was crisping and beginning to flake away.\\n\\n \"Stop it,\" Piet gasped.\\n\\n Neither the drow nor the demon even looked at him.\\n\\n \"Stop . . .\" he moaned and was about to drop his axe when the door burst open, and five men all but crawled over each other to get into the common room. Piet knew them all: Nedreg, the tall man from Sembia who was one of two men in the camp who\u0027d brought a sword with him. Kem, the short guy from Cormyr who also had a sword and who hated Nedreg as much as Nedreg hated him. Raula, the only woman in the camp, had a spear she said was magical but no one believed her. Aynd, Raula\u0027s husband, had a spear that was so warped he didn\u0027t bother telling anyone it was anything but an old piece of Impilturan army garbage he\u0027d found on the side of a road.\\n\\n The first of the five to get into the room was the foreman of the camp: a big man named Rab who claimed to have been a sergeant in the Cormyrean army, who was on the battlefield the day King Azoun was killed. Everyone believed what Rab told them-whatever Rab told them-because everyone was afraid of him. Piet never liked Rab, but seeing him burst into the blood-soaked tavern with his greataxe at the ready was the most beautiful thing Piet had ever seen.\\n\\n It was then, for no reason Piet could understand, that the dark elf finally attacked him. The greatsword moved so fast Piet could barely see it. Still, he managed to stagger back away from the blade. He tried to parry with his axe, but the dark elf never touched it. His greatsword whirled around it, flipped over it, pulled away from it.\\n\\n Piet had taken maybe ten steps before he even realized he was walking. He was closer to the demon than he\u0027d intended to go, but the monster was still pushing against the table behind which Ansen, Kinsky, and Lint were trapped. Ansen was still screaming. The tone of his voice had taken on a more desperate, almost girlish quality, and Piet found himself wishing the man would hurry up and die. It was the only humane thing.\\n\\n The other two men looked as if they were trying to scream but couldn\u0027t. The demon-thing glanced up at the men who\u0027d burst into the room but who were hesitating at the door still trying to understand the grim scene. The demon took advantage of their hesitation and pressed harder. Piet could see the thing\u0027s legs tense and the sharp claws on its feet dig into the floor. Kinsky\u0027s eyes popped out of his head, followed by a waterfall of blood. Lint coughed out a mouthful of blood, gurgled, and died. Kinsky tried to scream. The room filled with a series of loud cracking noises, and he went limp. Ansen finally stopped screaming, though he continued to burn.\\n\\n Rab and the others charged at the demon. Piet wasn\u0027t even sure they noticed the dark elf.\\n\\n \"Why?\" Piet asked the drow, who was watching the others charge the demon. \"What are you doing here? Why are you doing this? What do you want?\"\\n\\n The dark elf turned to him and raised an eyebrow, looking down his nose at Piet-though the human was easily six inches taller.\\n\\n \"What do you want here?\" Piet asked again.\\n\\n \"Nothing,\" the drow said in strangely accented Common.\\n\\n Piet was aware of some motion below him-something that looked as if the dark elf had shrugged-then he felt something wet on his neck, warm liquid pouring down his chest. Piet put a hand to his throat and his fingers met a pulsing jet of hot red blood shooting in a four-foot stream from his throat. When he tried to speak, his lungs filled with blood, then his eyesight blurred.\\n\\n The dark elf turned away from him, and as he died, Piet knew that the drow would never give him a second thought. He didn\u0027t live long enough to decide how he felt about that.\\n\\n Ryld didn\u0027t give the dead human a second thought. Five more of them had come in, and though Jeggred had dispatched the first three humans he\u0027d encountered with minimal effort, at least one of the newcomers looked like someone who could actually fight. Ryld didn\u0027t entertain for a second the thought that Jeggred might not be able to handle the five humans-even the one with the greataxe-but the five of them together might slow the draegloth down a bit, and that would have to do.\\n\\n Ryld sheathed Splitter, and before the blade was entirely covered his feet were off the ground. He intended to jump through the window and almost made it when someone grabbed his foot. Ryld knew before he turned that it was Jeggred. The draegloth pulled hard on Ryld\u0027s foot, and the weapons master twisted in his grip and kicked Jeggred in the face. The half-demon\u0027s head snapped back into one of the onrushing humans-one armed with a sword-who took the opportunity to slice at the back of the draegloth\u0027s head. The sword tangled in Jeggred\u0027s still-wet mane of thick white hair.\\n\\n Two more of the humans came up on either side of the half-demon and jabbed their spearheads into Jeggred\u0027s back. The spearheads sank into the draegloth\u0027s flesh, and Jeggred let out a loud growl. He let go of Ryld, who landed on his feet, face to face with the draegloth. The humans withdrew their spears, and Jeggred and Ryld shared a look that said Jeggred wanted the human male and female with spears. The swordsman drew his weapon back to stab the draegloth from behind. Jeggred spun away, sending the two humans with spears scattering. The human with the sword was left facing Ryld.\\n\\n \"The draegloth will kill you all,\" Ryld said, reasonably certain he got the Common right.\\n\\n The human seemed more frightened that Ryld could speak his language than he was of the dark elf himself. That was a mistake the man wouldn\u0027t make twice. \"Don\u0027t-\" Ryld warned as the human pulled his sword up to hack down at the dark elf.\\n\\n With an impatient sigh, Ryld flicked his sword in a fast arc in front of him and took the human\u0027s sword arm. The man staggered back, bulging eyes fixed on the blood pumping out of his stump. He looked at Ryld, made eye contact with him for the space of a heartbeat. The human seemed to be waiting for Ryld to say something, to explain why the drow had taken his arm. Humans were an odd lot. Ryld shrugged. The man opened his mouth to speak then fell over dead.\\n\\n The female human jabbed at Jeggred, and the draegloth grabbed the spear. He snapped it like a twig, and the woman backstepped away, her hands up in front of her face in a feeble attempt to fend off the half-demon.\\n\\n Ryld suppressed the urge to laugh. Instead, he bent quickly and ripped the dead human\u0027s hand off the sword. He had to break a few of the man\u0027s fingers to get the weapon free, but it certainly didn\u0027t matter to the swordsman anymore. The other spearman went for Jeggred with renewed fury, his hopelessly warped spear jabbing again and again at the draegloth, who danced out of its way, toying with the man. The woman had her hands on her mouth, apparently concerned with what might happen to the other spearman. There was something about the look on her face that Ryld recognized, and in response he tossed her the dead man\u0027s sword. She didn\u0027t notice the blade coming at her until it was halfway there, but she caught it just the same.\\n\\n The woman met Ryld\u0027s gaze, and the weapons master nodded at the draegloth. \"Take the dark elf, girl!\" the man with the greataxe yelled to the woman. The man with the greataxe had been barking orders all along, but Ryld hadn\u0027t paid much attention. Hearing someone order his death wasn\u0027t an entirely alien experience for Ryld, but there was something about the circumstances that frustrated him. He\u0027d just tossed her a weapon ... so what if he\u0027d taken it out of the severed limb of one of her comrades?\\n\\n The woman hesitated, looked at the sword as if she wasn\u0027t sure what to do with it, then looked at Jeggred. The draegloth stepped into the man with the spear, deftly slipping past the spearhead, and grabbed the logger\u0027s head in one of his huge, clawed hands. With a twist of the draegloth\u0027s wrist and a bend of his elbow the human spearman\u0027s head came free of his shoulders in a shower of blood.\\n\\n The woman screamed, and Ryld was taken aback by the sound. It was soaked with emotion-a sound Ryld hadn\u0027t heard often in Menzoberranzan. He looked at her and she met his gaze. Tears streamed down her face. She looked back at the draegloth, who was meeting the advance of the man with the greataxe.\\n\\n The woman dropped the sword and ran, rushing past Jeggred and the man with the greataxe to stumble out the door. Ryld heard her footsteps recede into the night.\\n\\n The weapons master longed to follow her.\\n\\n Rab Shuoc was born in the Year of the Striking Hawk in the Cormyrean city of Arabel. He grew up there, the son of a city watchman, and spent his childhood hunting rats with his friends in the back alleys and occasionally following his father on his rounds in the wealthier sections of the city. It wasn\u0027t the slightest bit surprising to anyone who knew him when he joined the army. Rab was fiercely loyal to the kingdom of his birth and the king he admired more than anyone but his father.\\n\\n He worked his way up the ranks, slowly, and was a sergeant when the ghazneths and goblins ravaged Cormyr and all but destroyed Arabel. He was nearly killed in the same battle that resulted in the death of the king, and he watched the city of his birth burned. His father was killed when part of a building fell on him. With the king and his father both dead, and no family of his own to tie him down, Rab simply walked away.\\n\\n He went on to become alternately a sellsword, a tavern bouncer, an innkeeper, a weaponsmith, then a logger. He was strong and smart, so he soon became foreman. His employers paid Rab a considerable sum in gold to gather crews to go deep into some of the most dangerous places in Faerun to find exotic woods. He quickly built a solid reputation among the lumber mill owners and loggers alike as a fair but tough leader who knew how to get the job done, and Rab always delivered.\\n\\n During those hard forty-six years of life, Rab Shuoc had missed out on a lot. There had been women but never a wife and never any children. Since the war he hadn\u0027t even had a home. He rarely worked with the same men more than one season at a time and had no real friends to speak of.\\n\\n He wasn\u0027t the kind of man who worried about his own happiness or even expected to be happy. He wanted to live, work, and be left alone.\\n\\n When he stepped into his common room and saw some of his crew already dead at the hands of adark elf and some kind of giant demon monster, he knew that if he wanted to live, he would have to fight harder than he ever had before. It was with that thought foremost in his mind that he stepped toward the two interlopers and got started with the last thirty seconds of his life.\\n\\n Raula was smart enough to tun, and Rab let her go. The dark elf watched her go too, and the demon ignored her. The huge, gray-furred creature locked its blazing red eyes on Rab and advanced on him. Rab hefted his greataxe and stepped into the demon\u0027s attack. He was aware of the drow facing him as well.\\n\\n The drow came in faster than the demon, swinging his enormous greatsword in a wild, chaotic fashion. Rab was sure he could parry the uncontrolled assault with ease and he held the steel haft of his greataxe in both hands so the greatsword would bounce off it-but it didn\u0027t.\\n\\n The tip of the greatsword wasn\u0027t where it was supposed to be. It didn\u0027t seem possible to Rab that someone could move such a huge, heavy weapon so quickly, but that strange dark elf had, and it was Rab who paid the price. The tip of the sword drew a deep cut across the logger\u0027s chest. Pain flared, and blood poured, and in that half-second of shock, the demon took his axe.\\n\\n He\u0027d been disarmed before but he\u0027d never had an opponent actually reach out and take the weapon right out of his hand.\\n\\n Rab was still puzzling over that when something even stranger happened: the dark elf drew his greatsword across the demon\u0027s back, cutting it deeply enough that blood sprayed from the wound and the creature roared. The drow said something in a language Rab didn\u0027t even recognize let alone understand. There didn\u0027t seem to be any anger, any emotion at all on the drow\u0027s face, but he was definitely trying to kill the demon.\\n\\n The huge creature spun on the much-smaller dark elf, and Rab backed away. He only got one step back before the demon reached around and grabbed him by the shirt, taking some skin with it. The monster lifted Rab, who weighed well over two hundred pounds, right off the floor without any sign of strain.\\n\\n Rab grabbed at the thing\u0027s massive clawed hand, but the demon\u0027s skin was like steel coated in coarse fur. There was nothing Rab could do but wonder at the monster\u0027s intentions. It whirled on the dark elf, who had his sword ready. The demon still held Rab\u0027s greataxe in one hand but almost seemed to have forgotten it.\\n\\n The demon threw Rab at the dark elf. The human barked out an incoherent, scared sound that might have been a scream or a shout. He didn\u0027t even know. It was the sound a man makes when he knows he\u0027s got less than a second to live and there\u0027s nothing he can do about it.\\n\\n Rab was impaled on the dark elf\u0027s greatsword. He could feel every inch of the cold steel as it slid through his chest. Strangely enough, it didn\u0027t hurt.\\n\\n Ryld held the human up and looked past him at the draegloth. The man died trying to make eye contact with him-Ryld would never understand why humans insisted on doing that. Ryld tipped his sword down in hopes that the man would slide off but instead had to quickly jerk back to avoid the blade of the human\u0027s greataxe, wielded by Jeggred, as it chopped down.\\n\\n The greataxe hit Splitter and sliced clean through. Ryld felt his eyes bulge and his blood at once boil and run cold. Splitter was broken. His greatsword. The weapon he\u0027d practically lived for, had developed his skills around for years, was destroyed.\\n\\n The human\u0027s axe must have been enchanted after all.\\n\\n The man fell away on the remaining length of the greatsword blade, and the sudden loss of his weight made Ryld fall backward. He let go of the shattered sword, and it clattered to the floor next to him.\\n\\n The weapons master reached for his short sword and almost had his fingers wrapped around the pommel when the axe blade came down again, split his dwarven mithral breastplate as if it were made of parchment, and buried itself into his chest. Ryld could feel the weight of it not only on him but in him. There was no pain, just a heavy, even pressure.\\n\\n The draegloth stood over him, drool hanging from his exposed fangs in shimmering tendrils, his eyes aglow in the orange torchlight.\\n\\n Ryld tried to breathe but he couldn\u0027t. No air was getting past his throat at all. He wanted to say something, but there was no way to form words. Besides, he didn\u0027t know what to say. He\u0027d turned his back on everything he knew for a woman he didn\u0027t know at all, a woman who chose a path for herself that would inevitably lead to her own destruction as surely as it had led to his. Part of him wished he\u0027d been killed by anyone but the filthy half-demon, but another part was satisfied that it took a draegloth to bring him down. He almost wanted to thank Jeggred for fighting him in the first place. It was more than he deserved.\\n\\n Jeggred moved closer, and Ryld was thankful that he couldn\u0027t breathe. He couldn\u0027t smell the half-demon\u0027s breath.\\n\\n Jeggred leaned on the axe blade and broke open Ryld\u0027s chest. The sensation was something beyond pain-a mind-twisting agony that only death could possibly cure.\\n\\n Hewatched the draegloth reach into his chest. Ryld\u0027s body started to jerk, and he couldn\u0027t stop it. The draegloth grabbed and groped inside his chest, and Ryld\u0027s vision faded in and out.\\n\\n When Jeggred pulled his hand away, Ryld\u0027s eyesight came back long enough for Ryld Argith, Master of Melee-Magthere, to see that his heart was still beating when the draegloth began to eat it.\\n\\n The weapons master\u0027s heart was strong, and Jeggred relished the texture as well as the taste of it. Ryld Argith was a worthy opponent, a good kill, and the draegloth wished he could stay and devour more of him. The drow was dead by the time Jeggred finished eating his heart, and he knew that Danifae and the others were waiting for him.\\n\\n Not bothering to wipe any of the blood, slime, or sap off himself, the draegloth touched the ring that Danifae had given him and used its magic to return to Sschindylryn. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/annihilation-war-of-the-spider-queen-5/page-21.html","bookId":2163,"book":{"id":2163,"title":"Annihilation (War of the Spider Queen #5)","description":"Storyline: Annihilation: War of the Spider Queen, Book V (R.A Salvatore Presents the War of the Spider Queen) \\n The fifth title in the New York Times best-selling saga of civil war and chaos in the darkest part of the Forgotten Realms setting.
