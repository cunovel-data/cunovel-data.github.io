{"id":97667,"no":19,"title":"Page 19","content":"Ryld stood knee-deep in the freezing water of the cold swamp. Jeggred was nowhere to be seen. The constant noise made it hard to pick out the sound of the draegloth moving, The strange smells masked Jeggred\u0027s rancid breath. The pinpoint stars and the odd patch of bioluminescence made it impossible to see the draegloth in the cold water and thick vegetation. The faerie fire the strange swamp cat had cast on him had long since faded away.\\n\\n He saw things moving in the water from time to time, mostly snakes, but no disturbances big enough to be the draegloth. Something slid past his leg, but there was no sign on the slime-covered surface that anything had passed by. It was definitely something alive, but it couldn\u0027t possibly be Jeggred. It didn\u0027t touch him again, whatever it was.\\n\\n Careful with each step, Ryld made his way across the swamp much more slowly than he\u0027d hoped. The thin coating of bright green algae that covered the water made it impossible for the weapons master to see his feet. With each step his boot met some resistance: a rock, something soft, something that might have been alive, something that was solid and round like a quarterstaff-there were a lot of those-and something sharp like a dagger blade.\\n\\n A bubble as big as Ryld\u0027s fist slowly expanded on the surface a few feet in front of him, sat there for a few seconds, then popped. Ryld stopped and watched it and winced when the smell of the air that had been trapped in the bubble finally wafted past his nose. The smell was reminiscent of the draegloth\u0027s horrid breath, but it was different enough that Ryld was sure that it wasn\u0027t Jeggred who\u0027d sent up the bubble-and it wasn\u0027t the first such bubble he\u0027d seen. Ryld stepped forward, his foot again brushing past some hard object below the water. He used a Melee-Magthere technique to slow his breathing and steady the shivering that threatened to slow his reaction time. He could see his breath condensing in the air in front of him in puffs of white steam when he exhaled, the air cold enough to make his teeth sting when he inhaled.\\n\\n An explosion of water doused his face and made him close his eyes. The water was thick with slime and grainy bits of something-Ryld couldn\u0027t even guess what. His eyes blazed with flashes of yellow light and pain that made his jaw tense.\\n\\n Still, he brought his sword up in front of him and slashed twice at whatever it was that had splashed him. His blade met no resistance.\\n\\n From much farther below, a set of claws grabbed at his left thigh, punctured, then pulled down. The claws dragged deep, ragged furrows in his skin, and Ryld could feel the heat of his own blood soaking his leg then cooling when it mixed with the cold water of the swamp.\\n\\n Stepping back and stabbing down, Ryld tripped over something in the water that felt like a length of petrified rope. Though he did his best to judge where the draegloth must have been to have clawed him like that, Splitter sank into the spongy ground under the water, never touching Jeggred. Ryld fell backward until the water wrapped him in its freezing embrace.\\n\\n The draegloth\u0027s next attack pushed one of Ryld\u0027s arms off the pommel of his greatsword and flipped it out to his side. Another set of deep cuts appeared on the underside of his left arm. Ryld wanted to scream, but he was under water, so he kept his mouth shut and brought his greatsword back under control. Even in the roar of swirling water that overwhelmed his hearing, the weapons master could sense the draegloth\u0027s jaws snap closed half an inch from his throat.\\n\\n The draegloth was on top of him, and all the half-demon had to do was keep Ryld under water and eventually the weapons master would drown. The mistake the draegloth made was to reveal his position so clearly, though, and Ryld took full advantage of that mistake.\\n\\n Pressing up with one leg, Ryld felt the heavy weight of the half-demon. The weapons master pressed harder, curling backward and straightening his leg-not an easy task since the draegloth outweighed Ryld by more than two hundred pounds. He almost had the draegloth rolled over his head, but-maybe due to resistance from the water, the cold, shivering, or exhaustion-Ryld\u0027s knees gave way, and the draegloth fell onto him.\\n\\n Jeggred\u0027s claws found the underside of Ryld\u0027s breastplate and made some shallow but painful cuts in the weapons master\u0027s belly. The cold water slowed the flow of blood, though. Ryld almost subconsciously noted the irony in that. He would drown in the water that was keeping him from bleeding to death.\\n\\n Ryld pressed again, using Splitter instead of his legs. Either the draegloth feared the greatsword or being totally submerged made him lighter, but Ryld managed to roll the half-demon off him. He made a few more blind jabs with Splitter to keep the draegloth at bay while he stood.\\n\\n When Ryld\u0027s head finally cleared the water, he looked around for Jeggred even before he started to breathe again. The draegloth was nowhere to be seen. Ryld struggled to his feet, slipping twice on what felt like slime-covered rocks. Still he managed to get Splitter up in front of him in both hands and ready. Ryld staggered through the water and across more odd obstructions under it, several paces from where he guessed that Jeggred shouldhave been lying after the weapons master rolled him off.\\n\\n He would have kept going but stopped when he heard another loud splash behind him.\\n\\n Ryld spun, keeping his sword up and ready, and saw a disturbance on the water: what he thought looked like signs of a struggle. Puzzled that Jeggred would be so brazen after having effectively taken Ryld by surprise more than once in that cursed swamp, the weapons master took one step closer to the splashing with his sword in front of him and over his head in an effort to be ready for any eventuality.\\n\\n The draegloth burst out of the swamp in a flurry of claws and legs. Water arced from his white mane as his head snapped back. He was wrapped in dark green ropes, some sort of plant he must have gotten himself tangled in. Ryld thought he saw the plants move, slithering against Jeggred\u0027s body like constricting snakes.\\n\\n Jeggred had barely enough time to take a deep breath. As quickly as he came up, the draegloth disappeared into another swirling eddy thatbroke up the slime covering the water.\\n\\n Ryld didn\u0027t have time to understand whathe\u0027d seen. Something wrapped itself around his ankle and pulled. The weapons master knew a hundred tricks to keep him on his feet even if someone really wanted to pull him down, but as much as he tried, whatever it was that had him was too strong.\\n\\n So he cut it.\\n\\n Splitter was still in his hands and still as sharp a sword as ever saw battle in the Underdark. Ryld brought the weapon stabbing down along the side of his body then in and through whatever had grabbed him.\\n\\n It wasn\u0027t easy-the thing around his ankle was as sturdy as it was strong-but he severed it and stopped short of cutting off his own foot. Ryld struggled backward through the water then stopped and turned when he saw something moving in the corner of his eye.\\n\\n Half a dozen of the green, ropy vines were sticking up out of the water like snakes scanning for their next meal. Ryld saw no eyes, no mouths, only green stalks as big around as one of the weapons master\u0027s sturdy wrists. They had no faces, but they were very much alive and appeared for all the world as if they were looking for him.\\n\\n One of the vines burst toward him, unraveling itself from the water to snake quickly through the air at Ryld\u0027s throat.\\n\\n The weapons master sliced fast and hard at chest level and took the first four inches off the end of the attacking vine. Greenish-yellow sap leaped from it like blood from a wound, and the vine quivered then fell into the roiling, slime-covered water.\\n\\n Another vine tried to wrap itself around Ryld from behind, and he could feel even more of them worrying him from beneath the surface. Ryld kept Splitter moving in fast, fluid motions in front of him and to either side, cutting through the water, taking the ends off one animated vine after another. Jeggred came back up, gasping for breath and ripping at a mass of the dark green vines. He was covered in the swamp slime, vine sap, and blood. One of the vines slipped around his face and into his mouth-a mistake. The draegloth bit down, and the bloodlike sap splashed over his cheeks. The vine quivered and went dead, but half a dozen more burst out of the water to take its place, and the draegloth was dragged under once again.\\n\\n This swamp, Ryld thought as he chopped down two more attacking vines, will kill us both before we can kill each other.\\n\\n Another reason to hate the World Above.\\n\\n Jeggred came back up again for just long enough to take another breath, and Ryld got the feeling that the draegloth was finally getting the upper hand over the damnable vines. Ryld cut through another vine then sliced off one that had almost managed to get all the way around his wounded thigh. The vines were still coming at him one after another, and Ryld had no way of knowing how many there were or if, let alone when, they might finally give up or he might kill the last of them. That and the possibility that the draegloth might come at him again made up the weapons master\u0027s mind.\\n\\n Ryld looked around, flicking his greatsword to his right to slice a vine then in front of him to cut through another, letting the movement of the vines in his peripheral vision chose his targets for him while he scanned for an escape route.\\n\\n To his right-he had lost all sense of direction a long time before so had no idea if he was facing north, south, east, or west-the water gave way to slightly more solid if not entirely dry land. Larger trees with long, whiplike branches made a forest of thin lines. Behind those hanging branches, Ryld saw a scattering of orange lights that must have been torches burning in the distance.\\n\\n He knew there might be any number of sentient creatures that could have lit those torches, and surely none of them were drow. Still, he might be able to use any sort of habitation to his advantage. If Jeggred chased him there, and it was a human town, an orc town, or an elf town, they might not like dark elves, but they\u0027d be terrified by the draegloth. That could buy Ryld time, if not allies. Another vine managed to get around his ankle and tug. Ryld went down to one knee, his face almost falling under the slimy water before he managed to slice the vine off him. He left a cut in his boot that let in the water, and he shivered. Free of the vine, the weapons master ran. He didn\u0027t bother trying to be quiet but splashed headlong through the knee-deep water. Behind him, Jeggred surfaced again, tore at the vines still covering his midsection, roared, took a deep breath, and went back down.\\n\\n Ryld stepped onto dry ground and hopped in an unseemly fashion as a setof vines worried at his heels. The ground was slippery and muddy, covered in patches with slick moss, but Ryld continued running, working past the occasional loss of footing. From behind him came the draegloth\u0027s peculiar growl and a flurry of splashes. As Ryld ran through the stinging, whiplike branches, dodging between the close-set trees while barely managing to keep on his feet, he could hear the half-demon panting, tearing, and growling behind him. Jeggred had surfaced again and was fighting his way free of the vines.\\n\\n The weapons master ran on, and soon the sounds of the struggling draegloth were joined by the faint echo of voices ahead. He came out of the forest of whiplike branches, still at an all-out run. The clearing was wide and relatively dry. A collection of stumps replaced the trees, and Ryld jumped up onto one of them then hopped to another and another, making his way toward the settlement. The stumps provided more even footing and were less slippery than the muddy, mossy ground.\\n\\n The torches burned from long poles stuck into the ground in a circle around a collection of a dozen small shacks and tattered tents. Even Ryld, who knew little of the World Above, could tell that the settlement was a temporary one and not an established village. The voices he heard echoing from one of the more permanent-looking buildings sounded human. The weapons master could pick out the occasional word in the human\u0027s common trade language. He\u0027d learned the language at Melee-Magthere but had few opportunities to use it, and many words were still unfamiliar to him.\\n\\n Off to one side of the settlement was a huge pile of trees, cut down, stripped of their branches, and stacked carefully in a pyramid almost ten feet tall. In Menzoberranzan it would have been a king\u0027s ransom in wood.\\n\\n Ryld made his way one stump at a time toward the bigger building but paused briefly to sheathe Splitter-and he was hit hard from behind. He fell forward off the stump, the greatswordstill in his right hand, and pain blazed from his back. He fell onto a stump, pushed off, rolled forward, and saw the dark shape of Jeggred scrambling up behind him. The weapons master kicked out hard with both feet and smashed the draegloth between his legs. Jeggred grunted and backed off, long enough for Ryld to get to his feet.\\n\\n Splitter in both hands, Ryld sent a feint at the draegloth\u0027s mid-section. Jeggred fell for it, spinning to the side. The weapons master hopped back up onto one of the stumps and jumped backward again from stump to stump. The soaking-wet draegloth was covered in slime, sap, and blood. His crimson eyes blazed in the darkness, and steam poured from his mouth and nostrils.\\n\\n Ryld tried to think of something to say, perhaps to taunt the draegloth, but his mind was a blank. Pharaun would have had a thousand irritating quips on the tip of his tongue, enough to drive his opponent to distraction, but Ryld could only keep his mouth closed and his mind on the fight. The two of them had gone well beyond conversation anyway.\\n\\n The Master of Melee-Magthere knew that the building was behind him. He could see the orange firelight from the windows growing brighter and could hear the voices growing louder. There didn\u0027t seem to be any change in the tone of the random bits of conversation that drifted out the window. No alarm had been raised.\\n\\n Jeggred clawed at him with one of his larger hands, and Ryld stepped in to cut his arm but found out the hard way that the attack was a feint. The claws of the draegloth\u0027s remaining smaller hand ripped across Ryld\u0027s face. The weapons master stepped back, and there were suddenly no more stumps behind him. He slipped on the muddy ground and at the same time slashed across his opponent\u0027s midsection. The tip of his greatsword traced a line of red across Jeggred\u0027s thigh, and the draegloth drew away long enough to allow Ryld to get his footing and jump three long paces backward.\\n\\n Orange firelight lit the battle-ravaged draegloth and glittered off his massive, daggerlike teeth. With a fang-lined sneer, the draegloth launched himself at Ryld. All the weapons master could do was bring up his hands-and his sword-to meet him.\\n\\n Jeggred hit him hard enough to drive the air from Ryld\u0027s lungs and push his greatsword into him so hard it sliced into the side of his face, nearly cutting the weapons master\u0027s ear off. Ryld felt his feet leave the ground, his body completely at the mercy of the draegloth\u0027s inertia. They went through a window, glass shattering into millions of tiny knives that cut them both in a hundred places. Ryld could only close his eyes and grunt when he hit a wood floor so hard with the heavy draegloth on top of him that at least one of his ribs snapped like a twig.\\n\\n The draegloth rolled, and Ryld pushed him off. Before he knew what was happening, they were both sitting on the floor of some kind of ramshackle tavern surrounded by a dozen very surprised humans.\\n\\n Let it in, Aliisza whispered into Pharaun\u0027s mind, but not too far. Pharaun sat on the deck, his tegs crossed, his eyes closed, and his palms pressed down against the pulsating surface of the living vessel. He tried to sort out the sensations that were coming at him. Some were physical, some were emotional, and some came in forms Pharaun had never imagined. He could smell something like algae cakes being grilled over an open fire. Flashes of light pulsed behind his eyelids and left trails and tendrils in their wake. The sound of the ship\u0027s pulse hummed in his ears. He grimaced when a horrid taste like rotting fish rolled across his tongue. That all happened at once then changed. You will use your body to steer it, Aliisza continued, as much as your mind.\\n\\n Pharaun could feel that she was right. A wave of hopelessness came from nowhere and made his flesh crawl. Almost at the same time he was charged with adrenaline and felt as if he could lift the ship physically over his head and throw it across the endless Astral and into the Abyss that way.\\n\\n Like that, Aliisza whispered. Yes . . .\\n\\n It wasn\u0027t wind or water that powered the ship of chaos but desire, entropy, malice, and confusion-those things and others like them.\\n\\n You will have to gather the will to move, Aliisza went on, which should be easy enough for you. Learn how to channel it through the ship and into the planar medium around you. There\u0027s no way to learn how to do that. You simply have to give yourself over to it, while keeping it at bay at the same time. Do you understand?\\n\\n Pharaun nodded, not wanting to speak.\\n\\n Something entered his skin at the wrist-a thin tendril like a length of string. The Master of Sorcere could feel it slip into a vein, tapping his blood. He tried to jerk his hand away, but his fingers were stuck to the deck.\\n\\n Don\u0027t panic, Aliisza sent. It won\u0027t take enough of your blood to weaken you, but it must have some or the connection will fail.\\n\\n You\u0027re asking me to trust it? Pharaun asked her. To trust this construct of demonic chaos?\\n\\n He felt her touch his cheek, her fingers warm and dry, but he couldn\u0027t see her. She remained invisible, insisting that he not reveal her presence to the others. Pharaun was content to keep her a secret.\\n\\n Another wave of conflicting emotions rolled through him, and he rode it out. The ship will feel what you feel, Aliisza told him, even as you feel what it feels. It will follow your commands now. When you\u0027re ready, will it into the Shadow Fringe and on from there.\\n\\n Will it? asked the mage.\\n\\n The same way you would lift your arm or open your eyes, she answered.\\n\\n That easy?\\n\\n The alu-fiend laughed and said, There are three sentient creatures out of a thousand that can do what you have done, my dear. Bonding with a ship of chaos is a dangerous proposition.\\n\\n How so?\\n\\n If it hadn\u0027t accepted you, it would have killed you, she replied, and in a very ugly, mean way.\\n\\n Pharaun sighed, interested but not surprised.\\n\\n You would have let it kill me? he asked.\\n\\n Aliisza thought about it for a long time then said, You have to do this, one way or the other. I had faith in you.\\n\\n Pharaun caught the sarcasm in her tone and cracked a smile. She was an alu-fiend and by all rights on opposing sides of a bloody, ever-unfolding war. Why would she care if the ship of chaos killed him or drove him mad?\\n\\n The tendrils slipped out of his wrists, and his palms came free of the deck. Navigating the ship will require your full attention, Aliisza advised, but if you\u0027re adrift or on a predetermined course, you will still be able to speak with your comrades and even cast spells.\\n\\n Convenient, the mage remarked.\\n\\n The ship of chaos was a war ship, Pharaun, she replied. It was created to fight, and the tanar\u0027ri who built it had no interest in having the most powerful spellcaster among them bound to the deck, helpless and mute. The ship will require a lot of you but not everything. Don\u0027t give it any more than it needs.\\n\\n Cryptic, the mage shot back. I like that.\\n\\n \"Are you all right?\" a voice asked, and Pharaun thought at first that it was Aliisza.\\n\\n You know perfectly well, he thought to her, that if I wasn\u0027t well I would simply-\"\\n\\n He realized that it wasn\u0027t Aliisza who\u0027d spoken but Quenthel.\\n\\n \"Master Mizzrym. . . .\" the high priestess said.\\n\\n Pharaun opened his eyes but had to blink several times before he could see clearly.The Mistress of Arach-Tinilith was standing over him, arms folded across her chest, her eyes stern and cold but distracted.\\n\\n \"I am well, thank you, Mistress,\" Pharaun replied. \"I have reason to believe that I am fully in command of the vessel and that it is suitably powered.\"\\n\\n He looked around at the others, who were standing behind Quenthel, also looking down at him. All he saw were Valas and Danifae.\\n\\n \"When the draegloth returns,\" Pharaun finished, \"we can be on our way.\"\\n\\n \"We won\u0027t be waiting for Jeggred,\" Quenthel answered, eliciting a sharp look from Danifae and a lift of one eyebrow from the mercenary scout.\\n\\n \"Mistress-\" Danifae began, but Quenthel held up a hand to silence her.\\n\\n \"Anyone who breaks off from this expedition,\" Quenthel said, \"without my permission will be considered to have deserted it.\"\\n\\n \"Surely that wasn\u0027t the intent of your nephew,\" Pharaun replied. \"I think it was hardly the intent of Master Argith either. Where we\u0027re going it seems to me that we\u0027ll need their str-\"\\n\\n \"We won\u0027t,\" the high priestess interrupted. Looking off into the darkness she continued, \"They are both strong, but where we\u0027re going there will be things around every stalactite that could rip them both to shreds. We\u0027re not going on a jaunt in the Dark Dominion. What we\u0027ll encounter will not be defeated by brute strength but with a clear and steady mind-the single-minded pursuit of one\u0027s own desires.\"\\n\\n Pharaun frowned and waited for one of the others to say something.\\n\\n Valas stood waiting for the females to sort it out.\\n\\n \"You seem to know what we\u0027ll see,\" Danifae said to the high priestess, \"but you don\u0027t know, not for sure.\"\\n\\n Pharaun, surprised by the way Danifae had pinned the high priestess down, looked at Quenthel, curious to hear her answer.\\n\\n \"I know that I can\u0027t stay here anymore,\" Quenthel answered. The vipers writhed slowly at her hip. \"This place is killing me. We know what needs to be done.\\n\\n Live or die, we live or die in the Abyss at the side of the Spider Queen.\"\\n\\n Pharaun lifted an eyebrow and smiled, glancing between the two females.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ve not even begun,\" Danifae warned. \"There will be much for Jeggred to do. We should wait.\"\\n\\n \"That, my plaything,\" the Mistress of Arach-Tinilith shot back, \"is not for you to decide. You\u0027ve presumed enough.\"\\n\\n Pharaun recognized that it took considerable effort for Danifae to look down, letting her smoldering red eyes linger on the deck instead of boring into the high priestess. The battle-captive had come a long way, and Pharaun caught himself smiling at her.\\n\\n \"Master Mizzrym,\" Quenthel said, \"take us to Lolth. Now.\"\\n\\n \"I will require a brief rest,\" the mage lied. Even as the words passed his tongue, he wondered why he waslying. He didn\u0027t look at Danifae. \"One more period of Reverie for us all. We should face the goddess rested and at our best.\"\\n\\n Quenthel didn\u0027t answer but turned and walked away. Danifae lingered.\\n\\n What are you doing? Aliisza whispered into his consciousness, startling the mage. He\u0027d forgotten she was there. That\u0027s not true.\\n\\n The Mistress of the Academy, he told the alu-fiend, isn\u0027t thinking clearly. Don\u0027t want to travel withoutyour draegloth? Aliisza asked.\\n\\n Would you?\\n\\n Pharaun could feel her laugh in his mind.\\n\\n \"Thank you,\" Danifae said.\\n\\n Pharaun looked up at her with a smile. Quenthel and Valas had both wandered off, but he used sign language to be sure they weren\u0027t overheard.\\n\\n Why should I continue to help you? he asked. What are you doing?\\n\\n She thought about it for a long time then signed back, I want you to promise me that you wont leave without Jeggred.\\n\\n And if I do?\\n\\n Danifae had no answer.\\n\\n The Mistress irritates me, the mage went on. I\u0027ve made no effort to mask that. She\u0027s tried to kill me in the past. She has treated me with less respect than I deserve, but she is the Mistress of Arach-Tinilith, the most powerful priestess in Menzoberranzan if not in the whole of Lolth\u0027s faithful-the matron mothers included. This is her expedition, and her orders are law where I come from.\\n\\n Not where I come from, Danifae replied, and I serve Lolth as well.\\n\\n \"Perhaps,\" Pharaun replied aloud, confident thatthe high priestess had gone back to her quiet, oblivious sulking, \"but in what way do you serve me?\"\\n\\n Danifae looked puzzled, her eyes inviting him to continue.\\n\\n \"You wish something of me,\" he explained. \"You ask me to put my life at risk and my future in Menzoberranzan. You ask me to defy the sister of the archmage, my master, and the Matron Mother of the First House, his mistress.\"\\n\\n \"You want to know what I will give in return?\" she asked.\\n\\n It was his turn to let his eyes invite an answer.\\n\\n \"Answer this,\" she said. \"Do you really want to travel through the Plane of Shadow, into the Astral, through the Plain of Infinite Portals, and to the sixty-sixth layer of the Abyss without Jeggred?\"\\n\\n \"He would be of service to us all, I\u0027m sure,\" said Pharaun, \"as he has been, but he doesn\u0027t serve me. He doesn\u0027t really even like me, if that can be imagined. You, on the other hand, have made an important and powerful new ally to replace the one you\u0027ve used up.\"\\n\\n You think Quenthel is \"used up\"? Danifae asked silently.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s not herself,\" answered the mage. \"That much is obvious, but the question remains: Why should I do anything for you?\"\\n\\n \"What do you want?\" she asked, and Pharaun got the feeling he could have asked her anything and she would have at least considered it.\\n\\n \"I would feel more comfortable if Ryld was here,\" he said, not caring if it made him sound weak.\\n\\n Danifae nodded and said, \"Even if he has gone over to Eilistraee?\"\\n\\n \"I doubt that that\u0027s happened,\" replied the mage. \"Master Argith isn\u0027t the religious type.\"\\n\\n \"His sword arm works for you, as Jeggred\u0027s claws work for me,\" she said.\\n\\n Pharaun smiled, winked, and nodded.\\n\\n \"I suppose that\u0027s fair enough,\" she said, \"but don\u0027t ask me to spare Halisstra.\"\\n\\n \"Who?\" Pharaun joked.\\n\\n That drew a smile from Danifae.\\n\\n \"Keep the draegloth away from Ryld,\" the mage said. \"Bring the Master of Melee-Magthere back here, kicking and screaming if you have to, but alive, and I\u0027ll take him from there.\"\\n\\n \"Agreed,\" Danifae said. She touched a ring on her right hand and disappeared. That took Pharaun by surprise.\\n\\n Interesting, Aliisza said from somewhere. Who is she?\\n\\n A battle-captive, Pharaun replied, or at least she used to be.\\n\\n Seems more like a priestess to me, said the alu-fiend.\\n\\n Yes, Pharaun replied. Yes, she does, doesn\u0027t she? \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/annihilation-war-of-the-spider-queen-5/page-19.html","bookId":2163,"book":{"id":2163,"title":"Annihilation (War of the Spider Queen #5)","description":"Storyline: Annihilation: War of the Spider Queen, Book V (R.A Salvatore Presents the War of the Spider Queen) \\n The fifth title in the New York Times best-selling saga of civil war and chaos in the darkest part of the Forgotten Realms setting.
