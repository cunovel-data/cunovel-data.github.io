{"id":97665,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"The swamplight lynx didn\u0027t smell prey. The scent that filled the great cat\u0027s nostrils was something different. The lynx had never come across anything like it, but whatever it was, it was a predator-the odor of a meat-eater was unmistakable. Padding softly, silently through the cold, shallow water, the lynx tipped its head up and waved its nose from side to side, honing in on the scent. A charge of energy thrilled through the cat. Its flesh tingled, its fur stood on end-a familiar feeling for the lynx, comforting, foretelling of a kill ahead and food. The lynx moved from shadow to shadow, still inside the treeline. It caught sight of the competing predator and recognized the shape of a man. Powerful and cunning hunters in their own right, men never respected another predator\u0027s stalking grounds. They ignored the scent markers, the scratches on trees, the most obvious signs. Its eyesight was the least of the cat\u0027s senses even in daylight, and the creature could see and smell only that the intruder was a man. It had no way of discerning the man\u0027s black skin, pointed ears, crimson eyes, and white hair. The swamplight lynx gathered the Weave energy in its body, bared its fangs, and tightened into a crouch, ready to spring-when another scent all but slammed into its nostrils. Another predator was approaching. It was bigger, and it smelled bad. It smelled like a scavenger. The swamplight lynx relaxed but only a little. It watched the man, occasionally scanning the swamp\u0027s edge for the scavenger, and waited. Ryld was surrounded. There were noises everywhere. The place Halisstra had called a \"swamp\" was even more alive than the rest of the World Above, and the weapons master didn\u0027t like it at all. He could see things moving in the darkness around him. There were insects and spiders, all manner of flying creatures, and snakes . . . lots of snakes. The ground under his feet was spongy. He\u0027d felt similar in some of the bigger fungal colonies in the Underdark, but down there it was at least quiet. The ruined temple rose in black silhouette against the night sky in front of him. He\u0027d watched Halisstra walk toward it through ever deepening water with an increasing certainty that she was walking toward her own demise. Going to meet Danifae was stupid, even if Halisstra had allowed him to come along, and Ryld wasn\u0027t sure why he\u0027d let it happen. Could it be that she simply wished it and he was so accustomed to obeying priestesses that he\u0027d obeyed her? The weapons master took a deep breath, set his feet close together, and pressed his hands palm to palm in front of his chest. He steadied his breathing and cleared his mind as best he could, surrounded as he was by the unseen dangers of the swamp. He watched tiny yellow lights flicker in the air-some kind of bioluminescent insects moving slowly, sluggish in the cold night air. Pinpoints of light spattered across the black dome of the sky, not painful to look at and actually helping Ryld\u0027s natural darkvision. There was no other light except- Except for a faint purple glow shimmering in chaotic waves over Ryld himself. Faerie fire. Ryld drew Splitter and stepped back, opening his stance, then he turned around once three hundred and sixty degrees looking for anything moving toward him-looking for Danifae. It was a dark elf who had picked him out from the dark background using the magical ability she, like all drow, was born with. Who else could it be? She must have already killed Halisstra, Ryld thought. The world exploded in agonizing light, and he could hear something big running at him. Ryld had been trained to fight when unable to see, and as the foe that blinded him charged, he fell back on that training. The weapons master surprised himself with how well he\u0027d adapted to the way sound traveled on the surface world. He timed Danifae\u0027s charge-and it had to be Danifae-so that when she was no more than three strides from him, he stepped to the side. The echoes were oddly spaced. It almost sounded as if Danifae had four legs. That aside, Ryld had estimated correctly, and he stepped out of the way of the former battle-captive in time to feel her brush past him in a rush of cold air and an unpleasant, uncharacteristic strong musky smell. Still blind, Ryld heard her scuffle to a stop in the ankle-deep, wet moss. She turnedquickly and Ryld could feel her ready to come at him again. Ryld heaved Splitter in front of him, again as he was trained to do. The blade never bit into flesh and bone, but the purpose of that attack wasn\u0027t so much to kill as it was to fend off. He had been blinded by some sort of conjured light, which meant that his eyesight would return in time. The first rule of fighting blind was keeping yourself alive until you weren\u0027t blind anymore. It was exactly what he was supposed to do, but it didn\u0027t work. The moment Splitter passed to his left side, opening up his chest and face, she-it. . . something . . . dived on him. It was definitely not Danifae. It was no drow at all. The thing that smashed Ryld to the ground was enormous and covered in thick, coarse fur. It had four strong legs each with a set of long, sharp claws that tugged at his armor but were unable to cut him through his dwarven mithral breastplate. Ryld smelled hot, rank breath, and a name came to his mind: Jeggred. Why would the draegloth be there with Danifae? Unless the former battle-captive had brought Quenthel with her, but would they all really waste their time running after him and Halisstra when there was still a goddess to awaken? Ryld blinked, his sight returning in aching, cramping vibrations in his tired eyes. The claws worried at his armor and came dangerously close to his face as the creature-could it be the draegloth?-shifted in an effort to find some gap in his armor to exploit for the kill. Ryld pushed up with the flat of his blade and both his feet and rolled the heavy creature off him. When it hit the cold, spongy ground, it wriggled on its side in an effort to get to its feet. The thing growled, and the sound was both higher in pitch and less intelligent than Jeggred\u0027s. Ryld blinked blotches of purple from his eyes and whirled around and up to his feet,Splitter in front of him to guard against the inevitablenext pounce. If it was Jeggred, the draegloth was down on all fours and attacking him only with fangs and one set of claws. Ryld batted away a rake from the thing with the flat of his blade but failed to slice off the paw. It bit at him, but he stepped back, leaning away from the attack so that the creature\u0027s fangs snapped down on thin air. Ryld blinked again, and his eyesight returned to nearly normal. He wasn\u0027t fighting Danifae or Jeggred but some kind of furred surface animal. Ryld had seen similar animals: cats. The one that was trying to kill him was huge, ten feet from nose to tail. Mottled gray fur rippled over rolling muscles. Its tall, pointed ears twitched and moved independently of each other to track Ryld as it circled him, and the weapons master turned to keep the animal in sight at all times. Steam puffed from its nostrils into the cold air. Ryld felt a chill run through the undersides of his arms. He had a strange feeling of relief that he was only being hunted-again-by a native surface animal. Danifae hadn\u0027t taken her revenge after all, certainly not with Jeggred as her second. The weapons master briefly entertained the idea that Halisstra was right about her former servant, but the reality of his situation intruded once again. The animal leaped at him, and Ryld was ready for it. He had Splitter up and to the side and had just tensed his arms in preparation for a downward slice across his chest to dig at the animal\u0027s head when the thing stopped. The animal halted in midair for a heartbeat then fell. It made a sound that was halfway between a growl and a whimper when it hit the ground, already scrambling to regain its feet. The weapons master hopped back, bringing Splitter quickly in front of him to guard against- \"Jeggred,\" Ryld said. The draegloth held the huge cat by its tail, his eyes glowing red in the darkness. Even as the animal turned on him, Jeggred\u0027s lips pulled back over his teeth in a feral, hate-filled smile. Halisstra stepped off the stairs onto what she assumed was the highest floor of the slowly crumbling structure and there she saw Danifae. A gasp passed across her parted lips at the sight of her former servant. Danifae had always been beautiful-that was part of what made her such a desirable possession-but though it hardly seemed possible, the girl had grown even more attractive. The ample curves of her strong body made an alluring silhouette in the dark space, and her bright white hair framed her round, beautiful face in a way Halisstra had never seen on her normally pragmatic and simple battle-captive. \"What\u0027s wrong?\" Danifae asked, her voice quiet. \"Do I look different?\" Halisstra nodded and stepped away from the top of the stairs, careful to keep her back to the wall. \"Yes, you do. Freedom agrees with you, Danifae.\" \"Yes, Halisstra,\" Danifae replied. Halisstra did not fail to miss the fact that Danifae had called her by name. \"Freedom does agree with me,\" she continued, \"but there is much to discuss and precious little time.\" Halisstra arced an eyebrow and let a hand slip to the hilt of the Crescent Blade. \"You are in danger here,\" Danifae warned, her eyes darting to Halisstra\u0027s weapon. \"I was careless and was found out.\" Halisstra\u0027s blood went cold, and she said, \"Found out?\" \"I was gone too long,\" said Danifae. \"I was questioned by the high priestess and the mage, and they . . . did things to me to make me tell them about you, about Ryld, and all of it. All of it that I know.\" Halisstra tried to take a deep breath but found her chest tight with anxiety. \"Where are they?\" Halisstra asked. \"Far away,\" replied Danifae, \"and well prepared for their journey to the Abyss, but they sent Jeggred back with me.\" Halisstra\u0027s blood ran even colder, and she said, \"The draegloth? Why?\" \"To kill you both.\" Halisstra looked madly around the ruin and found the crack in the wall she\u0027d earlier seen Danifae standing in. Though it meant turning her back on Danifae, Halisstra ran to the crack and began wildly scanning the dark swamp below for any sign of Ryld. There was a pain in her chest she\u0027d never felt before. She couldn\u0027t see either the weapons master or the draegloth. \"He\u0027s out there, I assure you,\" said Danifae. \"So you drew me here?\" Halisstra asked, not turning from her fruitless search of the swamp below. \"You drew us both into a trap?\" \"Yes, I did,\" said the former battle-captive, \"but I can save you. I can save you, but I can\u0027t save you both.\" \"How can you stop a draegloth that has been sent to kill?\" Halisstra asked. She scowled, still scanning the swamp. There were spaces where the trees were tall and thick enough to hide the surface all together. Ryld must have gone in there, Halisstra thought, perhaps lured in by Jeggred. \"I can\u0027t stop a draegloth,\" Danifae admitted. \"If Jeggred means to kill you both, he will, or Ryld will kill him, or I will kill him. Either way, there will be deaths tonight.\" Halisstra sighed, not sure what to do and afraid that Ryld was already dead. \"I don\u0027t have to stop Jeggred,\" Danifae continued, \"or kill him. Just go, and leave the rest to Ryld and me. If the weapons master can best the draegloth, fine. If not, I can convince Jeggred that I killed you.\" \"Why would he trust you?\" asked Halisstra. \"He\u0027ll want to see my body ... or part of it at least. And what of Ryld?\" \"Let me get you out of here,\" the former battle-captive said. \"Get enough distance between yourself and the draegloth while he\u0027s still engaged with the weapons master and we can come to some arrangement. We\u0027ll have time to sort something out.\" Halisstra shook her head and stepped away from the crack in the wall. \"I won\u0027t leave Ryld.\" Halisstra smiled at the finality of her statement and the feeling that went with it. \"I can get you out of here fast,\" Danifae said, \"and I can move Ryld almost as easily, but it has to be one at a time. Come with me now, and I\u0027ll go back for the weapons master.\" Halisstra studied her former servant\u0027s face and saw nothing. Danifae didn\u0027t seem to be lying, but at the same time she didn\u0027t seem to be telling the truth. It was as if all expression had been sanded from her face. She was blank, impenetrable. That scared Halisstra. \"You\u0027ve trusted me this far, Mistress.\" Halisstra registered the return of the traditional title. Danifae held out a hand to her former mistress, and said, \"Trust me, Halisstra.\" Confused, the First Daughter of House Melarn shook her head. The former servant said, \"The longer we do this, the longer your weapons master fights the draegloth . . . alone.\" There was a brief moment of silence. Halisstra sighed, stepped toward Danifae, and took her hand. Eilistraee had been pushing her along for some time. Halisstra knew that, and she felt pushed again. She tried to remind herself of what she\u0027d told Ryld, that Eilistraee was guiding her but no goddess was guiding Danifae. As the interior of the ruined temple faded in a wave of vertigo and purple light to be replaced by a strange place somewhere that smelled and felt like the Underdark, Halisstra tried so hard to trust in Eilistraee that her head started to hurt. She thought about Ryld and her eyes filled with tears. The animal turned on Jeggred, and it was all claws and fangs. The swamp creature ripped a deep furrow in Jeggred\u0027s abdomen with its foreclaws. Blood welled up in the wound. Jeggred didn\u0027t flinch or cry out. Only a subtle narrowing of the half-demon\u0027s blazing red eyes indicated he\u0027d felt the cut at all. The draegloth stepped in, slashing with two of his four sets of claws, but the cat leaped to the side, avoiding the attack, and at the same time stepped in again, forcing Jeggred to defend himself. The cat was making a good showing of it, and Ryld knew it was the best chance he would have to run. By the time Jeggred managed to dispatch the beast-if he was able to at all-Ryld could be long gone. Even if he could leave Halisstra, wherever he went Jeggred would follow. If the draegloth had been sent to kill him, that\u0027s what he would do. The cat bit at Jeggred, and the draegloth moved his arm in and allowed the creature to fasten its powerful jaws on his upper right wrist.The fangs dented the draegloth\u0027s skin but didn\u0027t puncture it. Smiling, steam pouring from his nostrils into the cold air, Jeggred drew the claws of both of his left hands along the cat\u0027s flanks. The animal opened its mouth to howl in pain, and the half-demon\u0027s arm came free. Jeggred let the animal cut him. Four parallel lines of deep red blood traced behind the cat\u0027s raking claws. The animal was trying to hurt the draegloth in any way it could, but it was wounded and desperate and was making rash decisions. On the other hand, Jeggred only appeared feral. He was in control of himself. Ryld could see it in every twitch of the draegloth\u0027s eyes that anticipated the cat\u0027s attacks three or four moves ahead. Though the animal clawed him, Jeggred got in closer and wrapped one of his bigger, stronger arms around the animal\u0027s belly. The draegloth\u0027s claws made a popping sound when they punctured the cat\u0027s flesh, then a ripping sound as they opened its underside in three deep, ragged incisions. Things started spilling out of the madly writhing animal. Long ropes of intestines, things that must have been its kidneys, and other organs rode a torrent of steaming blood onto the spongy moss. Jeggred held the animal close to him and squeezed until more came out and kept squeezing until the cat was dead. Ryld stood a few paces away, watching, ready. He thought back on his training and the single overriding principal of defending against claws. Things with claws-any number of demons, trolls, and the like-stabbed then pulled down. Claw attacks always came high and ripped down. All he had to do was be ready for that. There was the fact that anything that attacked with claws would never parry. If Ryld set his blade against Jeggred\u0027s attack, the draegloth would avoid contact with the keen edge or risk dismemberment. Ryld could use that to his advantage simply by defending against the draegloth\u0027s arms as if they were swords. Jeggred would be put on the defensive by being unable to defend, and he wouldn\u0027t parry Ryld\u0027s attacks, but he would dodge. The draegloth looked up from his still-quivering kill and bared his knifelike fangs at Ryld. The weapons master stood his ground. He wasn\u0027t as strong as Jeggred, and he might not be as fast, but he was smarter and better trained. That might be enough. \"Why are you here?\" Ryld asked the draegloth. \"Surely you didn\u0027t come all this way just to save me from that cat.\" The half-demon, covered in the animal\u0027s still-hot blood, was steaming. \"I was told things about you, weapons master,\" Jeggred growled. \"Disturbing things.\" Ryld held Splitter in both hands in front of him and said, \"I can only imagine.\" \"The priestess I can understand,\" said the draegloth. He took a wide, slow step sideways, moving away from the dead animal. \"They\u0027re feeling particularly betrayed by Lolth. They seek power and communion, so it seems only fitting that if one goddess turnsher back on them, they might seek the embrace of another, but you?\" \"I can\u0027t seek the embrace of a goddess?\" asked Ryld, stalling as he examined the half-demon for wounds and weaknesses. \"Why would you,\" asked the draegloth, \"when you can have the embrace of a flesh and blood female?\" \"You have me all figured out,\" the weapons master said, surprised that the draegloth seemed to have done just that. \"My mistress has,\" Jeggred said with a shrug. He stepped to the side again, beginning to circle Ryld. \"She even now stands over the corpse of your traitor priestess. I get the pleasure of ending your life.\" \"It\u0027ll be a particularly painful and violent death, no doubt,\" Ryld said, irony absent from his voice. The draegloth smiled, coughed out a laugh, and charged. The big claws came in first, high, aimed for his chest. Ryld whirled Splitter in front of him then abruptly stopped the blade\u0027s spin and sliced up to parry the draegloth\u0027s right arm. As he expected, Jeggred drew his arm back sharply in an effort to avoid the enchanted greatsword. Ryld quickly changed direction, tucking the blade in, stepping back, and stabbing at the dodging half-demon. The tip of Ryld\u0027s sword penetrated the draegloth\u0027s furred hide under his shoulder blade to a depth of an inch or two. The half-demon, bleeding, hopped back, sliding off the blade. Ryld stepped back too, rolling the greatsword in both hands in a slow figure eight in front of him. Soon, one of them would be dead.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/annihilation-war-of-the-spider-queen-5/page-17.html","bookId":2163,"book":{"id":2163,"title":"Annihilation (War of the Spider Queen #5)","description":"Storyline: Annihilation: War of the Spider Queen, Book V (R.A Salvatore Presents the War of the Spider Queen) The fifth title in the New York Times best-selling saga of civil war and chaos in the darkest part of the Forgotten Realms setting.
