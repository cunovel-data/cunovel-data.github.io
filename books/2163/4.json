{"id":97652,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"It had been two days since Pharaun had contacted his master, and the news that sending had brought still sat heavily on the wizard\u0027s shoulders. The spell allowed only a short message to travel through the Weave from the Lake of Shadows into Menzoberranzan and an equally short message back. Ship of chaos is ours, Pharaun had sent, careful to use no unnecessary words though that was against his natural tendencies. Advise on proper diet. Don\u0027t trust captain. Any word of Ryld Argith or Halisstra Melarn? Sent home to report details. He\u0027d waited the interminable seconds for a reply, all the time wondering if the time he had been waiting for had come-the moment when Gromph Baenre, Archmage of Menzoberranzan, would fail to answer. That would be the moment Pharaun would know that they had failed, that they had no city to return to, no civilization to protect. That time had. not yet come. Feed it manes, the archmage had replied. As many as you can. Captain will serve power. Master Argith and Mistress Melarn not here. Stop your squabbling and get moving. Pharaun didn\u0027t stop to wonder how Gromph had known that the tenuous alliances within the expedition were fraying. Gromph was a drow himself, after all, and probably assumed it. If he thought he\u0027d had the time, Pharaun might have studied that point much more closely, tried to determine the degree to which Gromph was aware of their actions, but there was work to do. A manes demon was hardly the most daunting creature to either summon or control, but it was a demon nonetheless. He would have to use powerful spells to summon and bind them, all the while maintaining some measure of control over the uridezu captain who gave his name as Raashub. It had been two long, difficult, and tiring days for Pharaun. He had taken only enough Reverie to replenish his spells and was doing everything his considerable training allowed him to push his casting to its limit. The parade of hideous, groveling, snapping sub-demons he brought to the ship\u0027s deck began to amaze even himself, andPharaun hoped that Quenthel and the others were taking note. Those among them capable of gauging such abilities would have to be impressed, and if they were impressed they would be scared. So long as they were scared, he would be safe. As he led a string of the vile-smelling fiends into the gnashing jaws of the demonic ship\u0027s hold, Pharaun let his mind wander back to the rest of that sending. Ryld hadn\u0027t made it to Menzoberranzan, but that could mean anything. He could be dead anywhere between that cave on the World Above and the City of Spiders, or he could still be on his way. There was no straight line between any two points in the Underdark, and he could be only a few miles as the worm bored from Menzoberranzan and still have a tenday\u0027s travel ahead of him. Ryld might still hold a grudge for Pharaun\u0027s having abandoned him all those days before, back in the city, but Pharaun knew he still had a powerful ally in the Master of Melee-Magthere. The warrior might have fallen under the spell of the First Daughter of House Melarn, but if Halisstra herself still lived, surely she would be on her way to Menzoberranzan herself. Pharaun couldn\u0027t imagine the homeless priestess had anywhere else to go. Without Ryld at his side, Pharaun had given Quenthel and her draegloth nephew Jeggred as much room as the cramped deck allowed. They hadn\u0027t appreciated Pharaun leaving them to spin while he\u0027d gone to pick up Valas and Danifae first. Even Valas and Danifae had been surprised by that one, but Pharaun had long ago learned that whenever possible a cautious drow lets his enemies twist for a while, if only to remind them that he can. Still, the Mistress of Arach-Tinilith had been more than a little displeased, and Jeggred had made another serious attempt at a physical assault. Quenthel had held him back, if reluctantly, and charged the draegloth with guarding the uridezu. They were two of the same: demons on the wrong plane, pressed into the service of drow who were ready to take them back to the Abyss that spawned them. Pharaun let himself sigh at that thought. He knew it was a bad idea on its surface, going to the Abyss, but they had passed up the acceptable a long time before. They were in new territory. They were headed for the Spider Queen herself, and right when Lolth seemed least inclined to greet them. Pharaun was sure he wasn\u0027t the only one who had second thoughts about the expedition, even as strenuously as he\u0027d argued for their going forward. For a Master of Sorcere, it was a mission that could make him Archmage of Menzoberranzan. For her part, Quenthel had already achieved the highest post she could hope for. As Mistress of Arach-Tinilith, Quenthel was the spiritual leader of all Menzoberranzan and the second most powerful female in the city. Some would argue that she was indeed more powerful than her sister Triel. Of all drow under Faerun, she would surely be welcomed into Lolth\u0027s domain-assuming there was either a Lolth or a Demonweb Pits at all anymore-but still the high priestess was on edge. Her normally stern countenance had gone nearly rigid, and her movements were jerky and twitching. Any talk of the journey ahead made her pacearound the deck, all but oblivious to the lesser demons that often snapped at her or reached out to grab her. Even Pharaun, cynical as he was, didn\u0027t want to believe that the Mistress of Arach-Tinilith might be losing her faith. The fact that Jeggred also noticed Quenthel\u0027s unease didn\u0027t make the wizard feel any better. The draegloth\u0027s expressions weren\u0027talways easy to read, though the half-demon was the least intellectually capable of the party, but since coming to the Lake of Shadows-perhaps even before-Jeggred had looked at his aunt quite differently. He could see her agitation, though he might have thought it fear, and he didn\u0027t like it. He didn\u0027t like it at all. Pharaun closed his eyes and took a deep breath as the last of the day\u0027s manes went down the ship\u0027s gullet. He felt tired enough to sleep like a human. Without even bothering to cross the deck to the place where he\u0027d set his pack, Pharaun sank to the fleshy planks and sat. \"Before you slip into Reverie,\" Valas Hune said from behind him, \"we should discuss practical concerns.\" Pharaun turned to look at the Bregan D\u0027aerthe scout and offered him a twisted smile. \"Practical concerns?\" the wizard asked. \"At this point I\u0027m too tired for any kind of concerns . . . other than . . . the . . . ones that are . . .\" Pharaun closed his eyes and shookhis head. \"Are you all right?\" the scout asked, his tone comfortably devoid of real concern. \"My wit has failed me,\" Pharaun replied. \"I must be tired indeed.\" The scout nodded. \"We\u0027ll need supplies,\" he said, addressing all four of them. Quenthel didn\u0027t look up, and Jeggred only glanced away from the chained demon for a second. The draegloth shrugged and said, \"I can eat the captain.\" Pharaun didn\u0027t bother to look at the uridezu for a response, and the demon, sensibly, didn\u0027t offer one. \"Well, I can\u0027t,\" Valasreplied. \"Neither can the rest ofus.\" \"There will be no opportunity to stop along the way?\" Danifae asked. Pharaun regarded the beautiful, enigmatic battle-captive with a smile and said, \"We\u0027lltravel from this lake across the Fringe and into the Shadow Deep. From there to the endless Astral. From there to the Abyss. Any roadhouses along the way will be ... unreliable to say the least.\" \"Which is to say,\" Valas cut in, \"that there won\u0027t be any.\" \"What did you have in mind, Valas?\" Pharaun asked. \"How much are we talking about?\" The scout made a show of shrugging and turned to Quenthel to ask, \"How long will we be away?\" Quenthel almost recoiled from the question, and Jeggred turned to stare daggers at her back for a heartbeat or two before returning his attention to the captured uridezu. \"One month,\" Pharaun answered for her, \"sixteen days, three hours, and forty-four minutes . . . give or take sixteen days, three hours, and forty-four minutes.\" Quenthel stared hard at Pharaun, her face blank. \"I thought your wit had abandoned you, Master of Sorcere,\" Danifae said. She turned to Quenthel. \"An impossible question to answer precisely, I understand, Mistress, but I assume an educated guess will do?\" She looked at Valas, her white eyebrows arched high on her smooth black forehead. Valas nodded, still looking at Quenthel. \"The simple fact is that I have no idea,\" the Mistress of Arach-Tinilith said finally. The rest of the drow raised eyebrows. Jeggred\u0027s eyes narrowed. It wasn\u0027t what any of them expected her to say. None of us do,\" she went on, ignoring the reaction, \"which is precisely why we\u0027re going in the first place.Lolth will do with us as she pleases once we are in the Demonweb Pits. If we must be supplied, then we will need supplies for the length of our journey there and perhaps our journey back. If Lolth chooses to provide for us while we\u0027re there, so be it. If not, we will need no sustenance, at least none that can be had in this world.\" The high priestess wrapped her hands around her arms and hugged herself close. All of them saw her shiver with undisguised dread. Pharaun was too taken aback to see the further reactions of the others. A low, rumbling growl from Jeggred finally drew his attention, and he looked over to see the draegloth\u0027s eyes locked on Quenthel, who was successfully ignoring her Abyssal nephew. \"You talk like humans,\" the draegloth growled. \"You speak of the Abyss as if it was some feral dog you think might nip at your rumps, so you never rise from your chairs. You forget that for you, the Abyss has been a hunting ground, though you do most of your hunting from across the planes. Are you drow? Masters of this world and the next? Or are you . . .\" Jeggred stopped, his jaw and throat tight, and returned his steely gaze to the uridezu. The demon captain looked away. \"You assume much, honored draegloth,\" Danifae said,her clear voice echoing across the still water. \"It is not fear that prepares us for our journey, I\u0027m sure, but necessity.\" Jeggred turned slowly but didn\u0027t look at Danifae. Instead, his eyes once more found the Mistress of Arach-Tinilith. Quenthel appeared, to Pharaun\u0027s eyes at least, to have succumbed to the Reverie. Jeggred blew a short, sharp breath through his wide nostrils and turned a fang-lined smile on Danifae. \"Fear,\" the draegloth said, \"has a smell.\" Danifae returned the half-demon\u0027s smile and said, \"Fear of the Spider Queen surely smells the sweetest.\" \"Yes,\" Valas broke in, though Danifae and the draegloth continued to stare at each other with expressions impossible to read. \"Well, that\u0027s all well and good, but surely someone knows how long it will take us to get there and how long to get back.\" \"A tenday,\" Pharaun said, guessing for no other reason than to get on with it so he could rest and replenish his magic. \"Each way.\" The scout nodded, and no one else offered any argument. Jeggred went back to staring at the captain, and Danifae drew out a whetstone to sharpen a dagger. The vipers of Quenthel\u0027s scourge wrapped themselves lovingly around her and began, one by one, to sink into slumber. \"I\u0027ll be off then,\" Valas said. \"Off?\" Pharaun asked. \"To where?\" \"Sshamath, I think,\" the scout replied. \"It\u0027s reasonably close, and I have contacts there. If I go alone, I can be there and back quickly, and no one who doesn\u0027t fear Bregan D\u0027aerthe will even know I was there.\" \"No,\" Danifae said, startling both Valas and Pharaun. \"The young mistress has a better suggestion?\" Pharaun asked. \"Sschindylryn,\" she said. \"What of it?\" asked Pharaun. \"It\u0027s closer,\" Danifae replied, \"and it\u0027s not ruled by Vhaeraunites.\" She sent a pointed look Valas\u0027s way, and Pharaun allowed himself a smirk. \"I\u0027m tired,\" the Master of Sorcere said, \"so I will weaken enough to speak on Valas\u0027s behalf. He is Bregan D\u0027aerthe, young mistress, and his loyalty goes to she who is paying. I don\u0027t believe we\u0027ll have trouble with our guide jumping deities on us. If he can get to, through, and out of Sshamath faster, then let him do what he\u0027s been hired to do.\" \"He will go to Sschindylryn,\" Quenthel said, her voice so flat and quiet that Pharaunwasn\u0027t certain he\u0027d heard correctly. \"Mistress?\" he prompted. \"You heard me,\" she said, finally looking up at him. She let her cold gaze linger for a moment, and Pharaun held it. She turned to Valas. \"Sschindylryn.\" If the scout had any thought of arguing, he suppressed it quickly. \"As you wish, Mistress,\" Valas replied. \"I will accompany you,\" Danifae said, speaking to Valas but looking at Quenthel. \"I can move faster on my own,\" the scout argued. \"We have time,\" said the battle-captive, still looking at Quenthel. The high priestess turned to Danifae slowly. Her frigid red eyes warmed as they played across the girl\u0027s curves. Danifae leaned in ever so slightly, eliciting a smile from Pharaun that was as impressed as it was amused. \"Sschindylryn. . . .\" the wizard said. \"I\u0027ve passed through it a time or two. Portals, yes? A city crowded with portals that could slip you in an instant from one end of the Underdark to another ... or elsewhere.\" Danifae turned to Pharaun and returned his smile-impressed and amused. \"How much time do we have?\" Valas asked, still ignoring the more subtle, silent conversation-within-a-conversation. Pharaun shrugged and said, \"Five days . . . perhaps as many as seven. I should have provided the ship with adequate sustenance by then.\" \"I can do it,\" Valas replied. \"Barely.\" The scout looked to Quenthel for an answer, and Pharaun sighed, pushing back his frustration. He too looked at Quenthel, who was gently stroking the head of one of her whip vipers. The snake swayed in the air next to her smooth ebon cheek while the other vipers slept. Pharaun got the distinct impression that the snake was speaking to her. A sound caught Pharaun\u0027s attention, and he saw Jeggred shifting uncomfortably. The draegloth\u0027s eyes twitched back and forth between his aunt and the viper. Pharaun wondered if the draegloth could hear some silent, mental exchange between the high priestess and her whip. If he could, what he heard was making him angry. \"You will take Danifae with you,\" Quenthel said, her eyes never leaving the viper. If Valas was disappointed, he didn\u0027t let it show. Instead, he simply nodded. \"Leave when you\u0027re ready,\" the high priestess said. \"I\u0027m ready now,\" the scout replied, perhaps a second too quickly. The viper turned to look at the scout, who met its black eyes with a furrowed brow. Pharaun was fascinated by the exchange, but exhaustion was claiming him all the more quickly as the discussion wore on. Quenthel slid back to rest against the bone rail of the undead ship. The last viper rested its head on her thigh. \"We will take Reverie, then, Pharaun and I,\" the Mistress of the Academy said. \"Jeggred will stand watch, and the twoof you will be on your way.\" Danifae stood and said quietly, \"Thank you, M-\" Quenthel stopped her with an abrupt wave of her hand, then the high priestess closed her eyes and sat very still. Jeggred growled again, low and rumbling. Pharaun prepared himself for Reverie as well but couldn\u0027t help feeling uneasy at the way the draegloth was looking at his mistress. Danifae slipped on her pack as Valas gathered his own gear. The battle-captive walked to Jeggred and put a hand lightly on the draegloth\u0027s bristling white mane. \"All is well, Jeggred,\" she whispered. \"We are all tired.\" Jeggred leaned in to her touch ever so slightly, and Pharaun looked away. The draegloth stopped his growling, but Pharaun could feel the half-demon watch Danifae\u0027s every move until she finally followed Valas through a dimensional portal of the scout\u0027s making and was gone. Why Sschindylryn? Pharaun asked himself. It was the battle-captive\u0027s calming touch with the draegloth that accounted for the wizard\u0027s uneasy Reverie.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/annihilation-war-of-the-spider-queen-5/page-4.html","bookId":2163,"book":{"id":2163,"title":"Annihilation (War of the Spider Queen #5)","description":"Storyline: Annihilation: War of the Spider Queen, Book V (R.A Salvatore Presents the War of the Spider Queen) The fifth title in the New York Times best-selling saga of civil war and chaos in the darkest part of the Forgotten Realms setting.
