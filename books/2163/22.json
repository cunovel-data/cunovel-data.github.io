{"id":97670,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"\"Ryld Argith is dead,\" Danifae said to Quenthel, her eyes darting at Pharaun. The mage sat quietly, legs folded, in front of the mainmast. He didn\u0027t look back at her, seemed to have no reaction at all. Danifae chewed her bottom lip, her eyes flickering back and forth between Pharaun and Quenthel.\\n\\n \"And?\" the Mistress of Arach-Tinilith prompted.\\n\\n \"I killed him,\" Jeggred grumbled.\\n\\n Danifae looked at the draegloth, whose eyes were locked on Pharaun. Still the mage made no move and never looked at either the draegloth or her. She\u0027d promised to spare the weapons master but had lied. Danifae half expected the mage to burn her to ciders where she stood for the betrayal. Either he was too busy with his preparations for the journey, or he didn\u0027t care ... or he was planning something for later.\\n\\n \"And Halisstra Melarn?\" Quenthel asked.\\n\\n \"I tore his body to shreds,\" Jeggred went on, oblivious to his aunt\u0027s question, \"after I ate his heart. There\u0027s barely a piece bigger than a bite left of him, spread out over that freezing mud hole.\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Danifae said, smiling at the draegloth, who was still looking at Pharaun, \"well, be that as it may, Halisstra has in fact done the unthinkable. She enjoys the protection of Eilistraee now, and there\u0027s no longer any doubt.\"\\n\\n \"You have evidence of that?\" Pharaun asked, his voice quieter, weaker somehow, or maybe just bored.\\n\\n \"She told me,\" Danifae replied, still looking at Quenthel.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s true,\" the draegloth added.\\n\\n Quenthel turned on Jeggred, her face right, her eyes blazing. Still,she looked tiny in front of the hulking creature.\\n\\n \"How would you know, fool?\" Quenthel spat. \"You weren\u0027t brought here to think.\" \"No,\" the draegloth answered, not shrinking the slightest in the face of the high priestess\u0027s rage, \"I was brought here to act. I was brought here to fight and to kill. How much of that have I done, my dear, dear aunt?\"\\n\\n \"As much,\" Quenthel replied, her voice coming out almost as a growl, \"or as little as I tell. you. As I tell you, not Danifae.\"\\n\\n Jeggred loomed over her, the muscles under his gray fur rippling with anticipation.\\n\\n \"Mistress Danifae,\" the draegloth said, \"is at least trying. She\u0027s acting-\" \"Without my direct orders,\" Quenthel finished for him.\\n\\n Danifae was afraid that Jeggred would continue, so she said, \"Only on your behalf, Mistress.\"\\n\\n Quenthel lifted an eyebrow and stepped closer to Danifae.\\n\\n \"We talked about that, didn\u0027t we, battle-captive?\"\\n\\n \"I am no one\u0027s captive now, Mistress,\" Danifae replied, \"but still I serve Lolth.\"\\n\\n \"By turning my draegloth\u0027s head?\" the high priestess said.\\n\\n Danifae felt the skin on her arms and chest tingle.\\n\\n \"No,\" she said. \"Jeggred helped me help you.\"\\n\\n \"Help me?\" asked the high priestess.\\n\\n The draegloth turned and skulked away. He found a spot near the bow and sat with his head bent downward. Quenthel was still looking at Danifae as if she expected an answer.\\n\\n \"Mistress,\" Danifae said, \"I am without a home. You said you would bring me back to Menzoberranzan with you if I served you. That, and a host of other reasons, is precisely why I did what I did.\"\\n\\n \"Did I ask?\" Quenthel roared. \"Did I send you to do this?\"\\n\\n Danifae lifted an eyebrow herself and waited.\\n\\n Quenthel took a deep breath and turned away from the former battle-captive to stare out at the black water, lost in thought.\\n\\n \"My loyalty is with Lolth,\" Danifae said, \"and to the House of your birth.\" \"House Baenre,\" Quenthel said, her voice icy, \"has no room for upstarts, traitors, or battle-captives.\"\\n\\n \"I think you\u0027ll find, Mistress,\" the former servant pressed on, \"that I am neither an upstart, a traitor ... or a battle-captive. It is not I who dances under the gaze of Eilistraee, I am here, and I am ready to serve you, to serve Lolth, to serve Arach-Tinilith, Menzoberranzan, and the entire dark elf-\" \"All right,\" Quenthel snarled, \"leave it out. I don\u0027t need my arse li-\" \"Never, Mist-\"\\n\\n \"Silence, child,\" the Mistress of Arach-Tinilith said. \"Interrupt me again and taste venom.\"\\n\\n Danifae got the distinct impression that it was a hollow threat, but she silenced herself just the same. It wasn\u0027t easy for her to do. There was much she burned to say to Quenthel Baenre, but she decided that she would say it to her corpse instead. Besides, the vipers at Quenthel\u0027s command were still dangerous, and all five of them stared at her, their cruel poison glistening on darting tongues.\\n\\n \"Everyone,\" Pharaun called from where he sat, his eyes closed. \"Now that we\u0027re all here . . . what\u0027s left of us anyway . . . we\u0027ll be on our way.\\n\\n \"As the Mistress ordered,\" the mage added.\\n\\n Danifae took a deep breath and a last look at the dreary Lake of Shadows and said, \"We\u0027re ready, Master Pharaun.\"\\n\\n Quenthel turned to look at her, but only out of the corner of her eye. A thrill raced through Danifae at the emotions plain in that look. The Mistress of Arach-Tinilith was terrified.\\n\\n The ship began to move in response to Pharaun\u0027s will, and the wizard shuddered. Through his connection with the ship he could feel the cold of the water, the heat of his own body and the bodies of his comrades on the deck, and he could feel the lesser demons still being digested in the hellish transdimensional space that was the vessel\u0027s cargo hold. He found it an unusually pleasant mixture of sensations.\\n\\n Still water rippled and tapped against the bone hull as the ship glided slowly across the surface of the lake. Other than that, nothing changed at first.\\n\\n The walls are thin here, Aliisza whispered into his consciousness.\\n\\n They are, he agreed.\\n\\n The walls she referred to were the barriers between planes. In certain places and at certain times those barriers drew thinner and thinner and often broke all together. The Lake of Shadows was very close to the Plane of Shadows. The barriers between the two planes were especially thin there.\\n\\n It\u0027s good that you\u0027re starting slowly, Aliisza sent. It won\u0027t take much before we slip into the Sha-\\n\\n They were there.\\n\\n It took even Pharaun, who\u0027d had quite a bit of experience in planar travel, by surprise. As they passed from the Lake of Shadows onto the Shadow Fringe Pharaun saw what little color there was drain from the dimly lit cavern.\\n\\n The movement of the ship was smooth but disturbingly random. The deck rose gently, then fell gently, then rose a little farther, then fell not as far, then rose the same amount, then fell less far. Pharaun couldn\u0027t tell if, on aggregate, they were going up, down, or staying the same. Sometimes they slipped straight to one side or rolled gently to the other. His stomach rolled with the ship, and he felt increasingly nauseous.\\n\\n Don\u0027t ride it, Aliisza advised. Be it.\\n\\n Pharaun concentrated on the deck, on the palms of his hands pressing against the warm, living bone. He watched random memories from the devoured souls pass across his consciousness then looked deeper into the ship itself.\\n\\n Though the vessel lived, it didn\u0027t think. He felt it react to stimulus, riding the cool water of the lake into the freezing water of the Fringe. It knew it had crossed into the Plane of Shadow by feel but had no way to form the word \"shadow.\" The ship didn\u0027t like the Shadow Fringe, it didn\u0027t fear the Shadow Fringe, and it didn\u0027t hate the Shadow Fringe. All it did was ride the water from one universe to the next at the command of the Master of Sorcere.\\n\\n Pharaun\u0027s stomach felt fine.\\n\\n Valas had traveled the Shadow Fringe before and was not impressed. It was a world devoid of color and warmth-two things the scout had little appreciation for anyway. Every turn in the caverns of the real Underdark had a requisite turn in the Shadow, but distance and time was distorted there, less predictable, less tangible.\\n\\n The scout had been hired to guide the expedition through the Underdark, but they had left the Underdark. They were in a realm more suited to the wizard, on their way to a world only a priestess could appreciate. The time for Valas Hune to step aside was at hand.\\n\\n Among the trinkets and talismans that adorned his vest was a cameo made of deep green jade that he wore upside down. He looked around, making sure that none of the others were looking at him. They were all too busy standing in awe of the difference in the air and water, obsessed with thefeel of the ship moving across the shadow-water, to notice him. Touching the cameo with one finger, the scout whispered a single word and closed his eyes while a wave of dizziness passed through him.\\n\\n Having sent his message back to his superiors at Bregan D\u0027aerthe- a simple message they would easily interpret along the lines of \"I\u0027m no longer needed here\"-Valas let go of the cameoand joined the others in marveling at the sometimes subtle, sometimes extreme differences in the world around them. Bregan D\u0027aerthe would answer in their own time.\\n\\n Danifae could barely contain herself. The feel of the deck rocking beneath her was thrilling. The draining of color from the world around her wasexhilarating. The thought that they were on their way, and that thus far everything she\u0027d planned had come to fruition excited her. The presence of the draegloth next to her reassured her.\\n\\n Danifae had never felt better in her life.\\n\\n \"The wizard will avenge him,\" Jeggred grumbled in what sufficed for a whisper from the hulking half-demon.\\n\\n \"The wizard will do what is best for the wizard,\" Danifae replied.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know what you mean,\" said the draegloth.\\n\\n Danifae could hear the frustration in his voice.\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t fear him,\" she said. \"I know that. Forget the wizard. He won\u0027t put his own life at risk to defend Ryld Argith, who\u0027s dead anyway and no longer of use to anyone. Even now, if he isn\u0027t too busy piloting the ship, he\u0027s coming to the realization that the weapons master had abandoned us all-including him-anyway, so to the Hells with him.\"\\n\\n \"And to the Abyss with us,\" the draegloth said, \"at Pharaun\u0027s mercy.\"\\n\\n \"Pharaun has no more mercy than you and I, Jeggred,\" said Danifae, \"but he has his orders from his archmageand his own reasons for remaining with the expedition. If he puts anything at risk at any time in the Shadow Plane, the Astral, or the Abyss, he dies. Until then, I want you to leave him alone.\"\\n\\n \"But-\"\\n\\n \"No, Jeggred,\" Danifae said, turning to face the draegloth and look him directly in the eyes. In the dull gloom of the Shadow Fringe, his eyes glowed an even more brilliant shade of crimson. \"You will not touch him unless I tell you to, and even then only in the way I tell you to.\"\\n\\n \"But Mistress.. .\"\\n\\n \"Enough,\" she said, her voice flat with finality.\\n\\n There was a moment of silence intruded upon only by the creak of the rigging and the strangely echoing water splashing againstthe living bone of the ship of chaos.\\n\\n \"As you wish, Mistress,\" the draegloth said finally.\\n\\n Danifae forced herself not to smile.\\n\\n You will grow accustomed to the motion after a time, Mistress, Yngoth reassured her. Eventually, you won\u0027t notice it at all.\\n\\n The vipers could speak to her, directly into her mind, but Quenthel didn\u0027t know they could sense what she was feeling. She hadn\u0027t articulated, aloud or telepathically, how uncomfortable she was with the motion of the undulating deck.\\n\\n It\u0027s the water that\u0027s pushing us up and down, K\u0027Sothra offered.\\n\\n Quenthel ignored her, choosing instead to look out into the cold gloom of the Shadow Fringe.\\n\\n \"Care, all,\" Pharaun said, his voice distant and echoing in the strange environment. \"We\u0027ll be crossing into the Shadow Deep. There are dangers there. . . creatures, intelligences . . . keep your arms and legs inside the rail at all times, please. Try not to make eye contact with anything we might pass. Be prepared for any manner of strange effects and all manner of strange creatures.\"\\n\\n Only a wizard, Zinda hissed, could offer such vague and meaningless warnings. Does he expect any of us to jump overboard in the Shadow Deep?\\n\\n He\u0027s right, Yngoth argued. The Shadow Deep hides many dangers.\\n\\n \"Hold onto something,\" the Master of Sorcere advised.\\n\\n Perhaps the draegloth could keep you from falling, Mistress, Hsiv advised. Quenthel\u0027s lip curled in a sneer, and she flicked the offending snake under his chin. She looked over at the draegloth. Danifae\u0027s hand absently stroked his mane, and the draegloth stood very close to her.\\n\\n Quenthel looked away, trying her best to rid her mind of the image. She kneeled on the deck and wrapped her arms around the bone and sinew rail. No sooner had she tightened her grip than the world-or the water-dropped out from under the ship.\\n\\n They fell, and Quenthel\u0027s stomach lurched up into her throat. Her jaw clenched, and all she could do was hold on, her body tense and ready for the inevitable deadly stop at the bottom of whatever they were falling into.\\n\\n It took a terribly long time for that to happen. Finally Quenthel began to relax-at least a little-even though they were still falling and she continued to hold on to the rail for dear life. Quenthel gathered her wits enough to survey the rest of the expedition.\\n\\n The ship\u0027s deck was elongated and twisted, as if it had been pulled at either end by a strong but careless giant. Pharaun seemed twice as far away, Valas twice as close, and Danifae and Jeggred appeared to be hanging upside down. The draegloth held the battle-captive in one arm and the rail in the other.\\n\\n All around them black shapes flitted in and around the rigging, up and under the hull, and between the falling dark elves. The air was ribboned with black and gray, and there was a dull roar like wind but not wind that all but deafened her. The flying black shapes were either bats or the shadows of bats. In the Shadow Deep, Quenthel knew, the shadows would be the more dangerous of the two. We\u0027re stopping, Qorra said, and Quenthel knew it to be true.\\n\\n The sensation of falling had wafted away. It wasn\u0027t that they had slowed in their fall, and they certainly hadn\u0027t hit bottom, they simply weren\u0027t falling anymore.\\n\\n \"Sorry, all,\" Pharaun apologized, his voice cheerful and bright. \"A bit of a rough transition, that one, but you\u0027ll forgive my general inexperience with the whole piloting a ship of chaos thing, I\u0027m sure.\"\\n\\n Quenthel didn\u0027t forgive but also didn\u0027t bother to say anything. The ship was perfectly still, as if it had come up on solid ground, and the high priestess risked a glance over the rail.\\n\\n They hadn\u0027t come to rest on the ground, she saw, but had stopped in midair above a rolling landscape of gray cluttered with vaguely translucent silhouettes of trees. The shadowy, batlike things still raced all around them.\\n\\n \"Oh, yes,\" Pharaun added suddenly, \"and don\u0027t touch the bats.\"\\n\\n Quenthel sighed but never touched a shadow-bat.\\n\\n Pharaun extended his senses out into the Shadow Deep, using the properties of the ship of chaos in a way that felt natural to one who had become part of the demonic vessel. He did it the same way he would have strained to hear some distant sound.\\n\\n The Shadow Deep is not unlike your Underdark after all, Aliisza said, and like the Underdark it has its own rules.\\n\\n Pharaun nodded. He didn\u0027t pretend to understand those rules in any but the simplest way. He\u0027d always been smart enough not to linger in the Shadow Deep. We won\u0027t linger now, Aliisza said.\\n\\n She touched his shoulder, and Pharaun took a deep breath. He was reassured by her touch, and not only for her help navigating and piloting the ship. With Ryld dead, he was alone with a group of drow who\u0027d be as happy to see him dead as not. The alu-fiend might be more enemy than friend, but still Pharaun couldn\u0027t help thinking she was the only one he could trust.\\n\\n Can you feel it? she asked.\\n\\n Pharaun was momentarily taken aback. He thought she meant- The gateway, she said. Can you feel it?\\n\\n There was a lightness in his head and an itch on his right temple that made the ship turn and accelerate. His fingers curled, instinctively gripping the deck. I feel it, he said. The barrier is thinnest there. The ship will pass through. Yes, the alu-fiend breathed.\\n\\n She wrapped an arm around him from behind and pressed into his back. Pharaun\u0027s heart beat a little faster, and the wizard was amused with himself. He couldn\u0027t see her, but he could feel her, he could smell her, and he could hear her voice echoing in his skull. He liked it.\\n\\n At Pharaun\u0027s unspoken command the ship drifted across vast distances in insubstantial leaps. Like shadow walking, the ship slid across the Plane of Shadow faster than it should have, the distance compressing beneath it.\\n\\n Will we fall again? Pharaun asked Aliisza as they neared the place where the Shadow Deep gave way directly to the endless expanse of the Astral.\\n\\n No, she said, it will be different.\\n\\n It was.\\n\\n The ship was through in an instant. The darkness of the Shadow Deep with its sky of black and deep gray blazed into a blinding light. Pharaun\u0027s eyes clamped shut and were instantly soaked with tears. The ship shuddered. It felt as if the vessel were being battered on its side. Pharaun\u0027s breath caught in his chest, and there was a hard pressure there, a tightness. Fear?\\n\\n Don\u0027t be afraid, Aliisza whispered.\\n\\n Pharaun cringed at the word but had to admit to himself at least that he was afraid.\\n\\n He blinked his burning eyes open, and his head reeled so he almost fainted. There was such an expanse of nothing on every side of them that he felt too out in the open, too vulnerable, too . . . outside to be anything but tense and jumpy.\\n\\n The sky around them was gray, but it also held what Pharaun could only describe as the essence of light. There was no sun or any other single source of luminescence. The light was simply there, coming from everywhere at once, saturating everything.\\n\\n Bright streaks of multicolored luminescence rippled across the backdrop of saturated light-brilliant and chaotic aurorae.\\n\\n The ship rocked and shuddered, and Pharaun tensed again, fully prepared for the thing to shake itself apart. He held his teeth closed, then closed his eyes, and would have closed his ears if he could.\\n\\n No, Aliisza advised, don\u0027t close your eyes. Don\u0027t shut yourself off from it. Pharaun opened his eyes, mentally brushing off the resentment that boiled to the surface. He didn\u0027t like being told what to do, even when he knew he needed it. She squeezed him tighter and whispered in his ear, \"Think it. Think the name of it.\"\\n\\n It? he thought to her.\\n\\n Again she whispered with her real voice, her lips so close to his ear Pharaun could feel them brushing against the sensitive skin there: \"The Abyss.\"\\n\\n The Abyss, he thought. The Abyss.\\n\\n There it was.\\n\\n \"What is that?\" Quenthel asked.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re heading right for it,\" the draegloth said.\\n\\n Pharaun laughed and moved the ship faster toward the disturbance.\\n\\n That\u0027s it, Aliisza prodded.\\n\\n They were moving toward a black whirlpool in the sky. It was as big as Sorcere itself, maybe bigger. It was huge. The closer they got to it, the bigger it became, and not only because they were moving closer to it. The thing was actually growing.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re not projections here,\" Valas said. \"If we fly into that thing . . .\" \"We\u0027ll end up where we meant to go,\" Pharaun said.\\n\\n His own voice sounded strange in his ears, as if he hadn\u0027t spoken in ages. Tell them to hold on again, Aliisza said. They won\u0027t need to, but it\u0027ll reassure them.\\n\\n \"Hold on,\" the wizard repeated. \"Hold onto something, and hold on tight or you\u0027ll be tossed overboard and lost in the limitless expanse of the Astral Plane for all eternity, set adrift for all time to come, never to be seen or heard from again.\"\\n\\n Aliisza giggled, quietly in his ear, her breath tickling him.\\n\\n They made straight for the whirlpool, and when the tip of the bow hit the trailing end of the disturbance, all Hell broke loose.\\n\\n Literally.\\n\\n Pharaun couldn\u0027t help but scream as the ship was whirled so madly around that his head snapped back and forth. His hands threatened to come away from the deck. Something hit him in the back of the head. Aliisza squeezed him, then let go, then squeezed him again. Pain flared in his legs and side, and he didn\u0027t know precisely why. The others were making noises as well: screaming, growling, calling out questions he couldn\u0027t understand, much less answer.\\n\\n \"This is it,\" Aliisza shouted into his ear. He still couldn\u0027t see her. \"This is what you came for. This is where you\u0027re going. You brought yourself here, but now it\u0027s time for the Abyss to decide if you live to walk its burning expanse. The Abyss will decide if you get what you want.\"\\n\\n \"What?\" Pharaun asked. \"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n \"The Abyss decides, Pharaun,\" the alu-demon said, her arms slipping away from him, \"not you.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re almost there,\" the wizard said. \"I feel it. It\u0027ll let us in.\"\\n\\n Not me, Aliisza whispered into his mind. I leave you here.\\n\\n \"Why?\" he asked, then thought to her, Come with me.\\n\\n The alu-demon giggled then was gone, and Pharaun screamed again.\\n\\n Until the roaring of the whirlpool dropped to nothing and his own screaming rattled his eardrums.\\n\\n The ship stopped spinning but continued to fall, accelerating down and down while Pharaun struggled to regain control. Aliisza was gone, and the subtle help she provided, the extra consciousness at the helm, was gone with her. He tried to think of some spell to cast, but his mind, tied to the ship that was damaged in ways he was only dimly aware of, wouldn\u0027t form the list of spells. The sky had gone red, and there was a sun, but it was huge and dull. The heat was stifling, and Pharaun had trouble drawing a deep breath. Sweat poured from him, stinging his eyes and soaking his forearms.\\n\\n \"Pharaun,\" Quenthel screamed, her voice shrill and reedy, \"do something!\" Pharaun formed a number of replies as they continued to dive, faster and faster downward, but he didn\u0027t bother with any of them.\\n\\n \"Dosomething?\" he repeated.\\n\\n The wizard started to laugh, but the laugh turned into a scream when the ship rolled over upside down.\\n\\n Below them was a level plain that went on and on forever in all directions with no horizon. Tinted red by the dull sun, the sand shimmered with heat. Scattered all over were deep black holes-thousand of them . . . millions of them.\\n\\n He knew where they were. He had heard it described.\\n\\n They had come to the Abyss. To the Plain of Infinite Portals.\\n\\n They were falling and falling and screaming and screaming until they hit the ground.\\n\\n The ship of chaos shattered into a thousand shards of bone and sinew, the human-skin sail ripping to shreds. The sound was a wild cacophony of snapping and booming and tearing and cracking. The four drow and the draegloth aboard the ship were sent spinning into the air, rolling and tumbling to a stopon the burning sand. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/annihilation-war-of-the-spider-queen-5/page-22.html","bookId":2163,"book":{"id":2163,"title":"Annihilation (War of the Spider Queen #5)","description":"Storyline: Annihilation: War of the Spider Queen, Book V (R.A Salvatore Presents the War of the Spider Queen) \\n The fifth title in the New York Times best-selling saga of civil war and chaos in the darkest part of the Forgotten Realms setting.
