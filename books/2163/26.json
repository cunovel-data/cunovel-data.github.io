{"id":97674,"no":26,"title":"Page 26","content":"\"Welcome to the Abyss, corpse,\" the glabrezu said. His voice was a low, rolling growl. \"Welcome to my home.\" \"Belshazu,\" Quenthel said, her scourge in her hand, vipers writhing expectantly. The demon didn\u0027t look at her. Instead, he kept his burning eyes locked on Pharaun. \"I\u0027m going to rip your soul from your body, mage, and eat it raw then vomit it up so it drips all over your quivering corpse and soaks into your shriveling skin and runs into your gaping mouth so it knows that you\u0027re dead,\" the demon ranted. \"Well,\" Pharaun replied, \"if you say so.\" \"You will die,\" Belshazu said to Pharaun, \"in the shadow of your dead goddess\u0027s ruined fortress.\" The Master of Sorcere saw Jeggred step up next to him from the corner of his eye. The draegloth was growling almost as low and as thunderously as the glabrezu-the demon that happened to be his father. The glabrezu, its severed legs dripping dark blood onto the ancient battlefield, turned slowly to the draegloth and said, \"When I\u0027m done with the drow, son, you can join me-have your freedom from the dark elves at last.\" Jeggred drew in a breath, and Pharaun could tell he was ready to pounce, though the glabrezu was hovering well out of his reach. \"Jeggred . . .\" Quenthel started but stopped when the draegloth whirled on her. \"It\u0027s meat to me,\" Jeggred growled. \"Just another tanar\u0027ri scum. That thing is no parent of mine.\" He turned to the glabrezu. \"Call me \u0027son\u0027 again, demon, and it\u0027ll still be on your lips when I rip off your head.\" \"Fear not, draegloth,\" the demon replied with a feral grin. \"Even if you were full-blood I wouldn\u0027t give you a second thought. For a half-breed I won\u0027t even bother killing you.\" Belshazu turned his attention back to Pharaun but spoke to the rest of them. \"All I want is the summoner. Give me the wizard, and you can go on to meet your Spider Queen.\" \"Only him?\" Quenthel asked. Pharaun looked at her, and she tried to avoid his gaze, keeping her attention on the hovering glabrezu. The demon glanced down at his severed legs and said, \"The trick with the ice ... I had to snip my own legs off.\" He held up one of his four arms, one of two that ended in a hideous, sharp pincer claw. \"They won\u0027t grow back. At the very least, the whoreson owes me two legs. Give him to me now, and be on your way.\" \"Everyone,\" Quenthel said, her voice faraway and bored, \"step aside.\" The draegloth growled, and Valas appeared from behind a pile of broken bricks, shifting his feet in an uncharacteristically audible way. Pharaun looked at Quenthel, and she met his gaze evenly. \"Are you serious?\" the wizard asked. \"Yes,\" Quenthel replied. \"You summoned him, you bound him, you froze him in ice. The rest of this expedition is too important to waste fighting every monster we stumble across-not anymore anyway, and not to settle vendettas you bring upon yourself with your own simpleminded carelessness.\" \"Pharaun summoned that demon on your command, Mistress,\" Valas reminded her, but she didn\u0027t acknowledge the scout at all. Pharaun looked at Belshazu, who was quietly laughing, obviously surprised that Pharaun\u0027s companions had so quickly and easily sold him out. The wizard scanned the glabrezu quickly and found that he was flying thanks to a thin platinum ring on the little finger of his left hand. \"It\u0027s all right,\" Pharaun said. \"All we\u0027re talking about here is one legless glabrezu. Go on ahead, and I\u0027ll catch up in a minute or so.\" The glabrezu roared and moved closer. Pharaun\u0027s first impulse was to run, his second to stand and swallow. He forced himself to do neither. Instead he prepared his first spell. Something drifted past Pharaun\u0027s face. He leaned back a bit to avoid it, but something else tapped him under the chin. Dust rose up from the ground all around him-and pebbles, shards of petrified bone, and little bits of twisted, rusted iron. He looked at the glabrezu, who was holding up one of his two proper hands, a knowing grin on his canine face. Pharaun\u0027s stomach lurched, and he felt himself being pulled upward. His boots came off the ground, and he was falling-but falling upward along with the debris around him. The others backed out of the area where gravity had been reversed. Quenthel watched with a look of irritation, as if she were disappointed that the demon was taking so long to kill him. Valas drew his kukris but seemed unsure if he should intercede. Jeggred looked at Danifae, who waved him off but watched expectantly. With a sigh, Pharaun went to work. He touched the Sorcere insignia and used its levitation power to counter the gravity reversal. It was disorienting, but he managed to hover at the same level as the glabrezu. He then touched his steel ring and brought forth the rapier held within it. The weapon flew at the demon. As the blade flashed through the air, the glabrezu slashed at it with his claws and snipped at it withhis pincers. The demon had the advantage of being able to fly with the enchanted blade, and they quickly matched speeds so that Belshazu and the rapier were evenly paired. Pharaun took advantage of the stalemate to cast a spell. His stomach lurched again, and his levitation started to pull him up instead of down. The demon\u0027s upside-down gravity was gone. Belshazu could parry the animated sword\u0027s attacks but couldn\u0027t hurt it. At the same time the rapier nicked the demon here, slashed him there, and blood started to drip onto the dead ground from half a dozen cuts. \"Unfortunate,\" Belshazu hissed, almost to himself, \"but I would have liked to keep this one after I kill you.\" The demon made a gesture difficult to define-a blink, a shrug, a shudder-and the blade shattered into a thousand glittering fragments of steel that rained down onto the ancient battlefield. Pharaun felt his blood boil, his face flush, and his breath stop in his throat. I should have remembered, he scolded himself. I should have known he could do that. The Master of Sorcere wanted to hurl a string of invectives into the air, at Belshazu and the cold, uncaring multiverse, but he swallowed it. Still, he\u0027d always liked that rapier. \"I\u0027ll take the value of that blade out of your guts, demon,\" Pharaun threatened. The glabrezu\u0027s animal face twisted into a feral grin again as he rushed through the airtoward Pharaun. From behind him, the mage heard Valas say, \"You\u0027ll leave a fellow drow to a filthy demon? You\u0027ll leave us without a mage?\" \"Yes,\" Quenthel replied with an utter lack of regret that Pharaun actually found refreshing. The tanar\u0027ri approached quickly, and Pharaun pulled an old glove from a pocket of his piwafwi. He started the incantation even before the glove came out of the pocket, and by the time the glabrezu was in striking range, the spell was done. A hand the size of a rothe appeared in the air between the wizard and the demon. Though Belshazu tried to avoid it, he couldn\u0027t. The hand opened and pushed him through the air, forcing him away from the wizard nomatter how hard he resisted the conjured hand. Pharaun turned to Quenthel, who looked at him blankly when he said, \"What I\u0027m about to do, I should do right here and let you all taste it, but I won\u0027t. I\u0027ll push him away first and keep you at a safe distance. Nonetheless, I want you to remember, Mistress, that I can do this again, and by all rights I should do it again.\" He didn\u0027t bother to wait for a response-none came anyway-instead he turned back to the glabrezu who had been pushed by the spell several paces away in the air over the ruined temple grounds. Pharaun started to run over the uneven, debris-scattered ground, counting his paces as he went. Belshazu ripped and slashed at the conjured hand in a mad flurry of uncontrolled, frustrated attacks but to no effect. The magic held. When Pharaun had gone twenty paces away from the rest of the expedition, he stopped. He held the hand in the air, no longer pushing the glabrezu, but keeping him at bay. As he ran he\u0027d gone over in his mind again everything he\u0027d learned about tanar\u0027ri in general and glabrezu in particular. When he stopped he cast a spell-not a terribly complicated one-that would prevent another inconvenient manifestation of the tanar\u0027ri\u0027s natural magic. A ray of green light leaped from Pharaun\u0027s outstretched hands and found its way unerringly to the floating demon. The spell would hold him to the sixty-sixth layer of the Abyss, preventing the glabrezu from teleporting even within the confines of the plane. \"Tell me the-\" the wizard called out to the demon, stopping when Belshazu\u0027s huge pincer burst through the conjured hand. Solidified magic burned away from the surface of the black fist like blood clouding in water. The glabrezu grinned, grunted, and slashed at the hand. The great fingers twitched, their grip loosening. The wizard had never seen anything tear through that spell in the same way. The glabrezu was more powerful, more uniquely talented than Pharaun had given him credit for. Even as those thoughts passed through his mind, the drow mage pulled another spell out of the Weave. The demon\u0027s hideous pincer broke through one of the fingers. When it came away from the hand, the black magic burst like a bubble and the finger was gone. Belshazu pushed at the quivering, dissipating hand with one severed leg and his all-too-intact arms. As Pharaun\u0027s next spell began to form in the air above the demon, Belshazu fell out of the conjured hand and onto the wreckage-strewn ground. The demon roared at him, and it was all Pharaun could do to force himself to appear unaffected by the deafening, terrifying sound. Belshazu stood but didn\u0027t look up-didn\u0027t see the slab of stone assembling itself bit by bit in the thin air above him. \"Tell me the truth.\" Pharaun slid a loose strand of hair away from his eyes and asked, \"Can you tell I haven\u0027t washed my hair in over a tenday?\" The glabrezu growled, roared again, and leaped into the air--just as the wall of stone fell. The demon disappeared under it, and the ground shook. The wall cracked as it came to rest on the uneven surface. Belshazu lifted the several-ton slab off him just enough to turn his head and reveal burning eyes sunk in ableeding, animal\u0027s head. The look of the battered creature made Pharaun smile. The spell he\u0027d had to move so far away from the others to cast safely came to his lips as the tanar\u0027ri continued to slowly dig itself out from under the stone slab. When he completed the incantation, Pharaun opened his mouth wide and screamed. The sound came not from his lungs, throat, or mouth but from the Weave all around him and inside him. The sound rolled up, louder and louder, then shot out of him: a mad, keening shriek that smashed into the demon so hard it even blew the massive slab of stone into smoky vapor, then blew that smoke away into nothing. The sound crashed into the glabrezu, shaking him and spinning him into the air. Bruises exploded on Belshazu\u0027s tough red hide, and his bones cracked loudly one by one. The demon couldn\u0027t muster the breath necessary to scream, though Pharaun reveled in the obvious fact that he wanted to. Especially when pieces of him started coming off. Pharaun kept screaming, continued pushing air out of himself. The sound shredded the glabrezu, taking off skin, plates of exoskeleton, divots of fur, claws, fangs, eyes, then blood and entrails. The whole mess whirled in the air as if it were being stirred in a great invisible cooking pot, then all at once the spell-and the hideous shrieking scream-was gone, and the shredded remains of Belshazu fell in a heap on the battle-scarred ground. Blood continued to rain down in tapping spatters for a minute after the last big piece hit the ground. Pharaun sighed, pushed away his errant hair again, and stepped gingerly into the mess. He kicked pieces this way and that with the toe of one boot until his eyes settled on the thin platinum band. He bent and retrieved the ring, making some effort not to touch the tanar\u0027ri\u0027s blood. \"You owed me a ring,\" he said to the demon\u0027s mute remains then slipped the ring on a finger and turned back to rejoin the drow who had been more than happy to let him face the glabrezu alone. \"It looked big from a distance,\" Pharaun said as he ran a hand along a cold, rusted metal rib. \"It\u0027s even bigger from the inside.\" The Master of Sorcere looked up along the line of the gently curving steel beam and tried to guess how far above his head it ended-a hundred feet, maybe a hundred and fifty? \"Why was this just left here for a thousand years?\" asked Jeggred. The draegloth was sniffing the outer surface of the great spider fortress and seemed dissatisfied. \"It should have been cleaned up. Wouldn\u0027t the goddess want it cleared away?\" \"It hasn\u0027t been here a thousand years,\" Quenthel said. She was standing inside a huge tear in the side of the broken sphere, her arms crossed in front of her. \"I told you all, I was here.\" \"How long ago?\" asked Danifae. The high priestess looked at her with open contempt but answered, \"Ten years.\" \"Ten years ago,\" Pharaun asked, \"was this thing intact and moving?\" The Mistress of Arach-Tinilith nodded. \"How were you here?\" Danifae asked. Quenthel turned to Pharaun and said, \"If there is anyone alive in here, could you sense them?\" The wizard glanced at Danifae, who offered him a bored shrug. \"There are spells,\" he answered Quenthel, \"that will do that, yes. Do you think we\u0027ll find someone alive in here? Lolth herself, perhaps?\" \"If the Spider Queen is anywhere,\" said the Baenre priestess, \"she\u0027ll be here. This is her palace. Still, I don\u0027t sense her presence. I still can\u0027t feel her here at all.\" Pharaun nodded and looked around at the ruin again. \"Far be it from me to argue, Mistress,\" he said to Quenthel, \"but I find it impossible to believe that this construct was in operation a mere ten years ago. I\u0027ll admit I\u0027ve never seen materials like this-steel beams big enough to hold up a building, a magical construct as big as House Baenre-but I\u0027ve seen steel both old and new, and this steel has been laying out here for somewhat longer than ten years. I will accept that you\u0027re reluctant to tell us how you came to be here a decade ago, but. . .\" \"But what?\" Quenthel snarled. Pharaun stopped to think. The Mistress of Arach-Tinilith watched him the whole time, and finally he shrugged and shook his head. Quenthel turned and strode deeper into the wrecked spider fortress. Pharaun could feel someone looking at him, and he turned to see Valas lurking at the edge of a shadow. The scout was standing outside the wreck. Following Valas\u0027s glances, Pharaun watched Danifae and Jeggred follow Quenthel into the ruin. When the three of them had disappeared into the maze of twisted metal, Valas stepped closer. \"Do you really think she\u0027s alive in there?\" the scout asked. Pharaun shrugged and said, \"At this point, my dear Valas, I\u0027m willing to accept nearly anything. Time seems to have no meaning here-a different meaning anyway. Everything Quenthel says may be true, but then here we are at the very heart of Lolth\u0027s domain, and where is she?\" \"Where are the souls of the dead?\" asked the scout. \"We should be swarmed by departed ancestors, shouldn\u0027t we?\" Pharaun agreed. \"There should be all manner of creatures here: demons, driders, draegloths . . .\" Pharaun paused to chuckle. \"All manner of things that start with \u0027d\u0027 . . . but all there is is wreckage and ruins, calcified bone and rotting stone. It\u0027s the stuff of an epic lament.\" Valas stared into the darkness inside the spider fortress and sighed. \"I don\u0027t know my way around in there,\" the scout said, his voice barely above a whisper, \"Why am I still here?\" \"You were hired,\" Pharaun said. \"House Baenre pays Bregan D\u0027aerthe . . . everyone knows why you\u0027re here.\" \"No, I said, why am I still here?\" the scout asked. \"I was hired as a guide to get this expedition through the Dark Domain,and I have done that.\" \"You have indeed,\" Pharaun replied. \"I never said I knew . . .\" Valas started, but ended with a sigh. \"You\u0027re out of your element,\" Pharaun said, \"as are we all, but we could still certainly benefit from your skills.\" \"I could have helped you with the demon,\" said the scout. \"Quenthel wouldn\u0027t allow it,\" Pharaun replied. \"You got us here,\" Valas said, \"and as far as I know, even with the ship destroyed, you\u0027re the only one who can get them home, yet she risks you to prove a point that no one needs proven? Does that make sense to you at all?\" Pharaun smiled and shook his head, sliding an errant strand of hair out of his face, then said, \"I have been a thorn in the high priestess\u0027s side since we stepped out of Menzoberranzan. I\u0027ve lost track of the various different reasons why she might want to kill me, as I\u0027ve stopped counting the reasons I\u0027d like to see her dead, too. Still, perhaps she was confident that I could handle the demon on my own. I did, after all.\" \"There might have been a time when I\u0027d have thought that was good enough,\" Valas went on, \"but after all this, I can\u0027t help thinking it\u0027s just stupid, and potentially wasteful. Her behavior is erratic.\" \"I think were all a bit erratic,\" Pharaun admitted, \"but I agree in principle with what you\u0027re saying. I think the snakes are whispering to her more and more. She\u0027s lost control of both the draegloth and Danifae, has never had control of me, and knows that you\u0027re only here because of House Baenre\u0027s gold. We finally get to the Demonweb Pits and this is what we find? An ancient ruin? She should be insane. We all should be.\" Valas thought about that for a while, and Pharaun waited for him to respond. \"My contract is at an end,\" the scout finally said. Pharaun nodded, shrugged, and said, \"I will leave that for you to decide, but I have to admit I\u0027d rather have you stay with us than leave. I can use spells, as the priestess asked, to find anything that might still live here, to find any latent sources of magic. If I\u0027m the guide here, fine, but we could well need you again soon. Besides, can you even get back on your own?\" The scout tipped his head up, raised an eyebrow, and gave the hint of a smile that faded before it was completely recognizable. \"Well,\" Pharaun said, \"perhaps you can then. I\u0027m going inside anyway, and if you\u0027d like to join us, so be it. We can discuss why, if you\u0027re capable of returning to Menzoberranzan on your own, you\u0027re concerned that I might be the only one who can get you back and Quenthel\u0027s tried again to kill me.\" The scout bowed ever so slightly and held back a smile. \u0027\u0027Why do you care, anyway?\" Valas asked. \"About what?\" \"All of this,\" said the scout. \"Lolth . . .\" The scout nodded and Pharaun replied, \"I\u0027m curious. It\u0027s a unique challenge for a spellcaster, and my hard-fought position in Menzoberranzan depends on the harder-fought position of my superior, who depends on the matriarchy for his power-his political power, anyway.\" Villas nodded and Pharaun gestured toward the rip in the wall of the spider fortress. \"After you?\" Pharaun said. Valas walked past him, but his reluctance was plain in each forced step. Halisstra couldn\u0027t move. She let herself hang in the aether, crying, holding her head in her hands, fending off both Uluyara and Feliane who were trying to comfort her. She could hear them repeating one reassurance after another and could feel them touching her, hugging her, wiping away her tears, but she didn\u0027t care. She didn\u0027t know what to do, and something was wrong with her. We brought you along too fast, a voice hummed in her head. It was a female voice, quiet but strong. I\u0027m sorry. Halisstra blinked open her eyes and looked around for the source of the voice. Uluyara and Feliane had moved away from her-what would have been a few paces if they\u0027d been standing on ground-and both of them stared with open mouths at an apparition floating only just within reach of Halisstra.It was the ghost of a drow female, resplendent in robes of flowing silk, all color drained from her, a wind that Halisstra couldn\u0027t feel carrying her long white hair in a halo around her head and brushing her robes out behind her. \"Seyll,\" Halisstra whispered, the name almost sticking on her tongue. The shade, who was looking Halisstra directly in the eyes, nodded, and again the voice sounded in her head. Eilistraee has many gifts to offer our sisters from the World Below. Pain, unfortunately, is one of those gifts. \"You can keep it,\" Halisstra shot back, anger rising to replace the crushing remorse that the disembodied soul of Ryld Argith had left in its wake. Feliane and Uluyara reacted to her reply with puzzled expressions, and Halisstra realized they couldn\u0027t hear Seyll. I know, the dead priestess replied. Believe me, I know what it\u0027s like to experience these emotions all at once and for the first time. Your mind has been trained not to recognize them, but they\u0027ve been there all along, waiting for you to find them and set them free. Freedom isn\u0027t always easy. You\u0027ve gone on a long journey within yourself to a place where the emotional consequences may be more painful, but the rewards will be greater than you\u0027ve ever imagined. I don\u0027t care, Halisstra thought back. I don\u0027t want it. Right now, I\u0027d go back to the Underdark if I could. Would you? In a second, Halisstra vowed. There when I was being manipulated I knew it and knew the ends to which I was being pushed. There I was a priestess and a noblewoman. And here? Seyll asked. What are you now? An assassin, Halisstra answered. I\u0027m an assassin in the service of Eilistraee. What do you suppose is the difference between an assassin and a liberator? A liberator? Halisstra asked. When you kill Lolth, Seyll said, and you will kill her, you will set thousands free. . . millions. Dooming them to a life of despair and remorse? And love, contentment, trust, and happiness, Seyll replied. Halisstra paused to think about that, but her mind was blank. Her eyes burned, her jaw ached, and she felt heavy-so heavy she actually began to sink in the weightless aether of the Astral Plane. Feliane and Uluyara appeared on either side of her, holding her gently by the arms. Halisstra didn\u0027t look at them or at the ghost of Seyll. Instead, she let her eyes wander up and down the long column of silent souls. The dead were returning to Lolth. Everything she had feared had not come to pass. \"I could go back to her,\" Halisstra said. She could feel both Feliane and Uluyara stiffen. From Seyll she felt a wave of disappointment mixed with fear. \"If she would have you,\" Feliane whispered. That stopped Halisstra. Had she passed a point of no return, one where Lolth would reject her or worse, punish her for the heresies she\u0027d already committed? Would Eilistraee abandon her for even considering a return to the Spider Queen? Would she manage to work herself into a godless afterlife by her own indecision? No, Seyll whispered into her mind, obviously having sensed her thoughts. Eilistraee understands doubt and weakness and forgives both. \"Do you understand, Halisstra,\" Feliane said, \"what Seyll has given up by coming here?\" Halisstra shook her head in an effort to gently shake off the elf\u0027s words. \"She has abandoned Arvandor to come here,\" Feliane continued. \"Seyll has doomed herself to an eternity in the wild Astral, and she\u0027s done it for you.\" \"Has she?\" Halisstra asked, eyeing the ghost of Seyll, who floated there staring at her. \"Or has she done that for Eilistraee? Did she come here on her own, or was she sent by a goddess who fears the loss of her assassin?\" Yes, Seyll said. Yes to all those questions. I have come here on my own, for Eilistraee, to protect you from Lolth, to protect you fromyourself, and to assure that you will do what you must do. \"Why?\" Halisstra asked. \"Why now?\" Because something is going to happen, Seyll replied. \"Something is going to happen,\" Uluyara repeated. Right now, Seyll asked, this very moment, do you want to go back to Lolth? If she poured her \"grace\" over you right now, would you accept it, accept her, and turn your back on Eilistraee? \"I don\u0027t know,\" Halisstra answered. You must decide, said Seyll, and you must decide now. The apparition gestured behind her at the long row of disembodied souls. Something was different, and it took Halisstra a few seconds to realize what was happening. The line of souls disappeared into the gray distance, what might have been miles away. The colorless ghosts were changing, one after another as if a wave was passing through them. Color and life, even substance returned to each soul in turn, but only for a brief moment, then the effect passed to the next dead drow in line. As the color passed in and out of them they convulsed, twisting in the air more from pleasure than from pain. The wave drew closer and closer, scattering the line of drow in its wake. \"She\u0027s back,\" Halisstra whispered. Seyll came closer to her, wrapping her ghostly body around Halisstra, who stiffened but didn\u0027t push the apparition away. She is back, Seyll whispered into her mind. Soon her power will course though you. I can protect you, but you have to want me to. You have to want Eilistraee, not her. Not that demon. Please. \"Please,\" Uluyara whispered. Halisstra closed her eyes and tried to return Seyll\u0027s ghostly embrace, but her arms closed over nothing. \"Eilistraee,\" Halisstra called, her voice breaking, \"help me!\" Seyll grew solid in her arms, and Halisstra felt the priestess\u0027s body quiver. Seyll screamed, and Halisstra heard it both in her rattling ears and in her tortured mind. \"Seyll,\" Uluyara shouted over the sound of pure agony that was ripped from Seyll\u0027s momentarily corporeal throat. \"No . . .\" Seyll\u0027s body disappeared, and Halisstra\u0027s arms wrapped around only herself. The scream echoed in her mind but left her ringing ears to the silence of the Astral Plane. She opened her eyes and saw Seyll floating in the gray nothing in front of her. The priestess\u0027s body was twisted and broken, her face wracked with pain. She had grown more transparent, and was quickly fading away. \"Seyll. . .\" Halisstra whispered. The priestess looked her in the eyes one last time, and though it seemed to cause her a considerable amount of pain to do so, she smiled as she faded from sight. Halisstra felt her body sag even as she was infused with an energy and confidence unlike anything she\u0027d felt before. \"She\u0027s gone,\" Uluyara whispered. \"She didn\u0027t abandon only Arvandor,\" Feliane said, her eyes wide with horror. \"She let the power of Lolth pass into her.\" \"To protect me,\" Halisstra whispered. \"It killed her,\" Feliane said. \"She didn\u0027t choose the Astral, she chose oblivion.\" \"The thing that I most feared myself,\" said Halisstra. \"It was oblivion that drove me to Eilistraee.\" \"She sacrificed herself,\" Uluyara said. \"For me?\" asked Halisstra. \"And for Eilistraee,\" Feliane said. Halisstra\u0027s mind reeled, but her eyes cleared of tears, and blood began to flow in her tired muscles. She felt alert, refreshed, even as she was overwhelmed. \"She sacrificed herself,\" Halisstra repeated, \"so I could . . .\" \"So you could serve Eilistraee,\" Uluyara finished for her. \"So you could wield the Crescent Blade.\" Halisstra put a hand on the hilt of the weapon that could kill a goddess and said, \"I hesitated, but I hope not for too long.\" \"She\u0027s awake,\" Feliane warned, \"or resurrected. She\u0027ll fight back.\" Halisstra thought about that. She tried to imagine facing Lolth herself in battle, and for the life of her she couldn\u0027t. \"We\u0027ll follow the souls to Lolth,\" Halisstra said, moving in that direction even before she finished speaking. Feliane and Uluyara fell in behind her.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/annihilation-war-of-the-spider-queen-5/page-26.html","bookId":2163,"book":{"id":2163,"title":"Annihilation (War of the Spider Queen #5)","description":"Storyline: Annihilation: War of the Spider Queen, Book V (R.A Salvatore Presents the War of the Spider Queen) The fifth title in the New York Times best-selling saga of civil war and chaos in the darkest part of the Forgotten Realms setting.
