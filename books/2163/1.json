She had killed all those around her and hadn\u0027t even bothered to devour their carcasses before moving on to those outside the zone of the dead.\\n\\n She was the strongest. She knew she was the strongest as yet another fell before her snapping mandibles. She was the one who would rise through the carnage and rule.\\n\\n She was the strongest.\\n\\n The others soon knew thisas well.\\n\\n So she was dead.\\n\\n Within the chaos, there was intelligence and purpose. Within the hunger and the slaughter, there was common cause. She was the strongest and would kill them all or rule them all, so they bonded together and tore her eight legs from her, devouring her fully before turning again upon each other.\\n\\n Another rose to prominence through deed and fearsome assault.\\n\\n That one, too, fell to the common cause.\\n\\n The mortal test continued. The strongest died, but the smartest remained. The manipulative remained-those who hid their strengths beyond what was necessary to kill the present opponent.\\n\\n Those who stepped forward, who rose above the tumult, died.\\n\\n Through all the millennia, she had recognized those who were stronger than she, and she had persuaded them to do her bidding or be killed. Strength came not from the size of her muscles but from the power of her cunning.\\n\\n In the frenzy of the birthing, in the contest of the slaughter, these traits paved the road to victory.\\n\\n To find the moment when individual strength was beyond the collective power to defeat it.\\n\\n To intrigue amidst battle to destroy any who were stronger.\\n\\n And for some, to admit defeat before oblivion\u0027s descent, to escape and survive, new demons of chaos to run wild about the planes and in the end to serve the winner.\\n\\n The numbers dwindled. Those left grew in power and size.\\n\\n Each waited and watched, deciding who must die before she could reign supreme, sorting through the tumult to facilitate that desired end.\\n\\n Those driven by uncontrollable hunger were dead now.\\n\\n Those driven by simple self-defense were dead now.\\n\\n Those driven by foolish pride were dead now.\\n\\n Those driven by instinctual survival were dead or were fleeing.\\n\\n Those driven by cunning remained, knowing only one could emerge in the end. For all the others, it would be servitude or oblivion. There were no other choices.\\n\\n As she had manipulated the mortals who served her and the mortals who feared her, as she had maneuvered even other gods through the centuries, so she controlled her offspring. This was the test of her decree.\\n\\n There were no other choices. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/annihilation-war-of-the-spider-queen-5/page-1.html","bookId":2163,"book":{"id":2163,"title":"Annihilation (War of the Spider Queen #5)","description":"Storyline: Annihilation: War of the Spider Queen, Book V (R.A Salvatore Presents the War of the Spider Queen) \\n The fifth title in the New York Times best-selling saga of civil war and chaos in the darkest part of the Forgotten Realms setting.
