{"id":97676,"no":28,"title":"Page 28","content":"Anger, hatred, and exhaustion passed between the archmage and the lichdrow. They were done with each other. Both only wanted to finish it. They stood a dozen paces apart, eyes locked. Dyrr began to cast a spell, and Gromph surrounded himself in another globe.\\n\\n Gromph began to cast a spell too, and the lichdrow kept casting. He was doing something complex. He meant to finish it indeed.\\n\\n Before Gromph could finish his spell-one meant to burn the already wounded lich once more-Dyrr whispered something the archmage couldn\u0027t quite hear, and the spell took effect. The skull sapphire burned red-hot against Gromph\u0027s forehead, and he reached up to throw it off him-but it disintegrated before he could touch it. The dust that fell over the archmage\u0027s face was dull gray and powerless. There would be no more protection from the skull sapphire and no more stored necromancies. Gromph knew it had taken a wish to destroy it.\\n\\n His own spell ruined, Gromph brought another to mind and said, \"Well, everyone\u0027s using the big spells today, aren\u0027t we?\"\\n\\n The lich ignored the jibe and started casting a spell the same time Gromph did. It was the archmage\u0027s that finished first: another minor divination spent to create a blast of arcane fire. The preternatural flames poured over the lich, who threw his arms over his face to block them but to no avail. Dyrr\u0027s dry flesh crisped and curled, and the lich staggered in pain.\\n\\n When the fire burned out, the lich lurched forward, red eyes bulging, his ever-present mask burned away, his face twisted in hatred and agony. Gromph could feel that despite the arcane fire Dyrr had finished his own spell. Cold coursed through Gromph\u0027s body, and he shook-and Gromph was getting painfully tired of shaking, shivering, and quivering-but the lich wasn\u0027t through with himyet. He could feel the warmth, the life itself, being drawn from him. He staggered backward, barely managing to stay on his feet.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll drain you dry, Gromph,\" the lich grumbled, his voice raspy and haggard. \"You\u0027ll die with me, with my House, and my cause.\"\\n\\n The lich began to cast again, and Gromph recognized the peculiar cadence and structure that revealed the incantation as a powerful necromancy. Gromph knew many ways to kill, but he also knew that Dyrr probably knew more.\\n\\n The archmage\u0027s hand tightened on his staff, and his arm jerked. A dull pain and a hard pressure settled in his chest, and when he tried to take a breath, no air came to him. His knees finally buckled, and he fell. Gromph forced air into his lungs, but barely a whisper made it in. Dark shadows began to coalesce at the edges of his vision, and his ears went numb with a roaring rush of blood as his body fought in vain to keep his brain alive. The ring was of no help. The lich wasn\u0027t wounding him, he was killing him soul-first.\\n\\n Gromph tried to speak, to utter the words of a spell that might save him, but he couldn\u0027t. Dyrr stepped closer, moving to stand over him. Gromph barely managed to turn his head to look up at the gloatinglich. The archmage had other means of escape but couldn\u0027t force himself to activate any of them. He could feel Nauzhror and Prath trying to speak into his head, but their words never fully formed. Gromph feared that his body was already dead.\\n\\n He tightened his grip on the staff, and his arm jerked again-the staff.\\n\\n Gromph forced every ounce of will he had left into pulling his other hand beneath him. He felt his fingers wrap around the staff.\\n\\n \"Fight it, Gromph,\" the lich growled at him. \"Suffer before you die.\"\\n\\n \"Arrogant-\" Gromph coughed out, surprising himself with his ability to speak, even if it was only that one word.\\n\\n \"What was that?\" the lich asked, taunting him. \"The last words of Gromph Baenre?\"\\n\\n \"Not. . .\" the archmage gasped.\\n\\n Gromph\u0027s arms tensed, his hands tight around the staff of power-an item so prized hundreds had died just to possess it for a day.\\n\\n \". . . quite,\" Gromph finished, and he broke the staff.\\n\\n The ancient wood snapped in response less to the force of Gromph\u0027s arms and hands than to his will. The staff broke because Gromph wanted it to break. Dyrr had time to take in a breath, Gromph had time to smile, then the world around them both became a raging hell of fire, heat, pain, and death. Gromph couldn\u0027t see the lich blasted to pieces. He was too busy worrying that the same had happened to him. He closed his eyes, but the light still burned them. He felt his flesh peel away in parts, sizzle, and crisp.\\n\\n It was over as fast as it started.\\n\\n Gromph Baenre drew in a breath and laughed through waves of burning agony. The ring started to bring him back to life a cell at a time and he lay there, waiting.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve done it,\" Nauzhror said, and it took a few murmuring heartbeats for Gromph to realize he\u0027d heard the Master of Sorcere\u0027s voice with his ears and not his mind. \"The lichdrow is dead.\"\\n\\n Gromph coughed and dragged himself up to a sitting position. Nauzhror squatted next to him. The rotund wizard began examining the archmage\u0027s wounds.\\n\\n \"Dead?\" Gromph said then coughed again.\\n\\n \"The cost was high, and not only the staff of power,\" Nauzhror said, \"but he\u0027s been utterly destroyed.\"\\n\\n Gromph shook his head, disappointed with Nauzhror. The lich\u0027s physical form was blasted to flinders when the staff unleashed all its power in one final burst, but a lich was more than a body.\\n\\n \"Dead?\" the archmage said. \"Not quite yet.\"\\n\\n Nimor Imphraezl stepped out of the Shadow Fringe and into the ruins of Ched Nasad. High above him, clinging to the remains of a calcified web street, was perched a massive shadow dragon, an ancient wyrm magnificent in the terror it inspired in all who gazed upon it.\\n\\n It was a dragon Nimor recognized instantly. It was the dragon Nimor had gone there to see.\\n\\n Stretching his own aching, exhausted, wounded wings-wings that were puny in comparison to the great shadow wyrm\u0027s-Nimor lifted himself up off the rubble-strewn floor of the cavern and into the air below the dragon. If the wyrm took any notice of him, it gave no sign. Instead, it continued as it had been, directing the clearing of the rubble in the preparation for the rebuilding of Ched Nasad. It was a huge task, even for the dragon.\\n\\n Nimor coasted to a slow, respectful stop on the web strand next to the dragon and bowed, holding the posture until the dragon acknowledged his presence. He was still bowing when the enormous shadow wyrm shrank into the form of an aging drow with thinning hair but a solid, muscular form, dressed in fine silks and linens from all corners of the World Above, every stitch as black as the assassin\u0027s heart.\\n\\n \"Stand,\" the transformed dragon said, \"and heed me.\"\\n\\n Nimor straightened, looked the drow-formed dragon in the eyes, and said, \"I am less than satisfied with the results at Menzoberranzan, Revered Grandfather.\" The dragon-drow returned Nimor\u0027s look and held it until Nimor had to look away. The assassin heard footsteps approaching but didn\u0027t turn around to look. Nimor knew whose they were.\\n\\n \"Nimor,\" someone said. \"Welcome to Ched Nasad.\"\\n\\n Nimor pretended to look around at the still smoldering ruins.\\n\\n \"Of course,\" the source of the second set of footsteps said, \"it will look quite different when we\u0027re finished.\"\\n\\n \"I clearly remember your promise,\" the transformed dragon said. \"Do you?\" \"Of course, Revered Grandfather,\" Nimor replied, head held high, showing no outward sign of weakness.\\n\\n Patron Grandfather Mauzzkyl drew a deep breath in through his nose then slowly said, \"You promised to cleanse Menzoberranzan of the stench of Lolth. Have you done that? Is that why you\u0027re here?\"\\n\\n Nimor didn\u0027t nod, shake his head, or sigh-nothing to make it seem to the patron fathers that he was guilty of anything. The two patron fathers who had approached him from behind stepped around him on either side and stood before Nimor flanking the once majestic wyrm.\\n\\n \"No,\" Nimor said.\\n\\n \"I have come from the City of Wyrmshadows,\" the patron grandfather went on, \"to aid Patron Father Zammzt in the reconstruction of Ched Nasad. Is that why you\u0027ve come from Menzoberranzan? To aid in the cleanup?\"\\n\\n \"No, Revered Grandfather,\" Nimor replied.\\n\\n \"Tell your tale to Patron Father Tomphael and Patron Father Zammzt,\" Mauzzkyl said, his voice cold and final.\\n\\n Nimor closed his eyes and said, \"I answer to-\"\\n\\n \"Tomphael,\" Mauzzkyl said. \"You will speak to me through Tomphael from this day until I order otherwise.\"\\n\\n Nimor had no time to argue, but that was the last thing he intended to do.\\n\\n Instead he watched, barely breathing as Patron Grandfather Mauzzkyl turned his back then transformed again into a dragon. The great wyrm stepped off the edge of the shattered web and disappeared into the gloom of the ruined city.\\n\\n \"Tell me what you came here to say,\" Patron Father Tomphael said.\\n\\n Nimor looked Tomphael in the face but saw no anger, pity, or contempt. Nimor had fallen in the ranks of the Jaezred Chaulssin, and he\u0027d done it just like that. \"Something has changed,\" Nimor said.\\n\\n \"Lolth has returned,\" Tomphael finished.\\n\\n Nimor nodded and said, \"Or she will soon. Very soon. The lichdrow failed, and the tide is turning in Menzoberranzan. I thought we\u0027d have more time.\"\\n\\n \"Dyrr is dead?\" Tomphael asked.\\n\\n Nimor nodded.\\n\\n \"And the cambion?\"\\n\\n \"Alive,\" said Nimor, \"but already withdrawing. He had an agent in the Abyss who gave a strange report. I still don\u0027t know what happened to the spider goddess, where she\u0027s been, or why she fell silent, but she has managed to pinch the Demonweb Pits off of the Abyss.\"\\n\\n Tomphael raised an eyebrow, and he and Zammzt shared a glance.\\n\\n \"So,\" Tomphael said, \"your tanarukks are deserting. What of the duergar?\" \"Horgar still lives, and when I left him he was still fighting,\" Nimor said. \"However, with the priestesses again able to commune with their goddess and the tanarukks marching home, the gray dwarves won\u0027t stand a chance.\"\\n\\n \"Menzoberranzan,\" Zammzt said, \"is the greatest prize. It was always the one thing most out of reach. We have had successes in other cities. The Queen of the Demonweb Pits was gone long enough.\"\\n\\n \"Was she?\" Nimor asked.\\n\\n \"Look around you,\" Zammzt replied. \"Once this was a drow trade city, openly obedient to the priestesses. Now it is a blank slate, and even as we speak it is being transformed.\"\\n\\n \"The other patron fathers and I,\" Tomphael said, \"under Patron Father Zammzt\u0027s expert guidance, will be concentrating our energies here.\"\\n\\n \"As you always intended?\" Nimor concluded.\\n\\n Tomphael sighed and said, \"I know you\u0027ve always considered me a coward, Nimor, but you were wrong. Only the fool misses the difference between the coward and the pragmatist.\"\\n\\n \"Only the young seek glory over success,\" said Zammzt.\\n\\n \"I could have won in Menzoberranzan,\" Nimor argued.\\n\\n \"Perhaps,\" said Tomphael. \"If you had, this conversation would have taken a very different tone. It was your opportunity to surprise us, Nimor. That is what you failed to do-surprise us. Our plans did not depend on the City of Spiders being delivered to us on a silver platter, nor did they assume that Lolth was never going to return from wherever it is she\u0027s been. We had this one opportunity, and we took all there was to take. There will be other opportunities to take more.\" \"Other opportunities. . . .\" Nimor repeated, rolling the words over on his tongue.\\n\\n \"You could be Anointed Blade again, Nimor,\" Tomphael said.\\n\\n Nimor nodded, bowed, and said, \"I will return to the City of Wyrmshadows . . . with your leave, Patron Father.\"\\n\\n Tomphael nodded, and Nimor turned and stepped into Shadow.\\n\\n Pharaun hadn\u0027t felt so good in so long, he\u0027d almost forgotten what it was like to be healthy. The priestesses, perhaps reveling in the return of their spells, were almost continuously chanting healing prayers. They conjured a banquet and clean, cool water. They healed every wound and soothed aching muscles. Stretching, feeling too good to bother with Reverie, Pharaun stood and watched Quenthel and Danifae work on Jeggred. Again, likely because they couldn\u0027t resist using the spells that had been denied them so long, the two females worked together. As they sat cross-legged on either side of a nervous, reclining Jeggred, Pharaun sensed flashes of the old physical relationship the two priestesses had shared not too long ago. There was the accidental touch that turned into a lingering caress, the heavy-lidded eye contact past the draegloth\u0027s wild white mane, and the occasional play of a tongue along parted lips as the words to a series of complex healings taxed even their spell-rejuvenated throats.\\n\\n The result of all of it was that Jeggred\u0027s severed hand grew back. Pharaun found the sight of the thing slowly taking shape from the dead end of the stump even more fascinating than the exchange between the two females. The hand came together in layers: bone, sinew, muscle, blood vessels, skin, fur, claws. When they were done, the draegloth stood, flexing his hand, jaw agape, body quivering.\\n\\n The two priestesses stood with him, separating, their eyes once again going cold toward each other.\\n\\n Jeggred looked first to Danifae and said, \"My thanks, Mistress.\" Then to Quenthel, \"Mistress Quenthel. . . .\"\\n\\n Anger poured over the high priestess\u0027s face like fog, and she turned away from her nephew, quickly gathering her pack.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ve rolled around on the floor long enough,\" she said, already walking swiftly down the corridor. \"This way.\"\\n\\n Danifae motioned to Pharaun to proceed, and the wizard gladly went after Quenthel. Valas followed behind the wizard, and Danifae and the draegloth took up the rear. Any distance, any buffer between the two priestesses was a good thing, and Pharaun was happy to provide it as long as they got moving. The Master of Sorcere was all but overwhelmed with curiosity.\\n\\n Quenthel led the way with a confident stride and such assurance that none of the rest of them argued or second-guessed her at all. They went from one corridor to another, passed through rooms, sometimes through doors that Jeggred had to force open by brute strength. All the while the interior of the spider fortress maintained its cold, dark, dead, rusted feeling. Though Lolth\u0027s power had definitely returned to the two priestesses, the construct was as dead as ever, and Pharaun got the distinct impression that wherever that power was coming from, it wasn\u0027t the sixty-sixth layer of the Abyss.\\n\\n When they saw light at the end of one of the passageways they all stopped, clinging to the walls and the concealing shadows. As he ran through the spells still available to him and closed his fingers over a wand that would send bolts of lightning crashing through the air, the Master of Sorcere took stock of the rest of the expedition. Quenthel and Danifae both looked down the corridor with hopeful, excited expressions. Jeggred looked at Danifae in the same manner.\\n\\n Valas was nowhere to be seen-as was usual for the scout.\\n\\n \"What is it?\" Jeggred asked, his voice as quiet as waspossible for the massive half-demon.\\n\\n Pharaun guessed, \"A gate.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s where we have to go,\" Quenthel said.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s correct,\" said Danifae.\\n\\n \"Well, then,\" Pharaun replied, \"we ought to proceed right away. Should we be prepared to fight our way through?\"\\n\\n Quenthel stepped away from the wall and started walking quickly, back tall and straight, toward the strange purple glow.\\n\\n Pharaun shrugged and followed, still holding the wand in one hand and the list of spells in his mind. The high priestess hadn\u0027t actually answered his question after all.\\n\\n By the time they got to the end of the corridor Pharaun\u0027s instincts were telling him to approach more slowly, more cautiously-but he\u0027d also grown accustomed to following the lead of the highest ranking priestess in attendance, so he followed Quenthel into the chamber at the end of the corridor with a hesitation in his mind but not in his step.\\n\\n The corridor opened into a huge, round, high-ceilinged chamber walled in the same rusted steel as the rest of the spider fortress. In the center of the otherwise empty space was a circle that appeared to be welded together from jagged, rusted pieces of the fortress construct itself. The circle stood up on its end, perhaps eighteen feet in diameter. The center of the ring was filled with opaque violet light, swirling and folding in on itself as if it came from a luminescent cloud of vapor trapped in the confines of the circle.\\n\\n Pharaun heard footsteps and brought the wand out from under his piwafwi.\\n\\n \"You will not require that here, mage,\" a voice echoed in the chamber.\\n\\n As the others filed into the room, Pharaun looked for the source of the voice. He sensed a figure lurking in a particularly dark shadow.\\n\\n \"There,\" Pharaun whispered to Quenthel. \"See it?\"\\n\\n Quenthel nodded and said, \"You will cast no spell; you will make no move toward it unless I order it. Do you understand?\"\\n\\n Pharaun said, \"Of course, Mistress,\" but the others stood silent.\\n\\n \"I said,\" the high priestess reiterated, \"do you understand?\"\\n\\n Danifae and Jeggred nodded, and Pharaun again said, \"Of course, Mistress. Can you at least tell me what it is?\"\\n\\n \"I prefer to be referred to as \u0027she\u0027,\" the voice said, \"being female.\"\\n\\n The figure stepped out of the darkest part of the shadow and strode confidently into the purple light from the active but untuned portal. The sight of it took Pharaun\u0027s breath away.\\n\\n The figure of a drow female slowly twisted and writhed a good ten feet in the air. The drow was perfectly formed and nude, her body more like Danifae\u0027s in its fullness than Quenthel\u0027s modest, strong frame. She dragged her hands over her body in long, slow caresses for which no part of her was forbidden.\\n\\n From her sides grew two sets of long, segmented spider legs. It was those four legs-and four more like it all together-that held the drow female up above the rusted floor.\\n\\n Pharaun had seen too many driders to count, but what stepped out in front of him was no drider. Everything about the spider-drow creature demanded the wizard\u0027s full attention. The drow form was beautiful-beautiful in a way that Pharaun had no words to describe. Her long, spindly spider legs simply reminded him of where he was: the home plane of- The Master of Sorcere shook his head slowly from side toside. It couldn\u0027t be. \"Lo-?\" he whispered.\\n\\n \"I am not the Queen of the Demonweb Pits, Master of Sorcere,\" the spider-drow said in accented High Drow. \"To even say it would be blasphemy.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve only read about you,\" Quenthel whispered.\\n\\n A second spider-drow appeared, stepping lightly out of the gloom, and a third hung suspended from the ceiling, both their drow bodies those of a writhing naked drow female.\\n\\n \"Abyssal widows,\" Danifae said.\\n\\n The name meant nothing to Pharaun.\\n\\n \"You are her handmaidens, and-\" Quenthel started.\\n\\n \"And her midwives. We were only legend,\" the first abyssal widow purred. \"We were only prophecy.\"\\n\\n \"Prophecy. . . .\" Quenthel whispered.\\n\\n \"We exist now,\" the abyssal window said, \"to guard the entrance to the Demonweb Pits.\"\\n\\n \"But,\" Pharaun said almost despite himself, \"we\u0027re in the Demonweb Pits.\"\\n\\n The beautiful drow female smiled, her teeth perfect and clean, the skin of her cheeks smooth and utterly devoid of blemish or imperfection.\\n\\n \"No,\" the creature replied, \"not anymore.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s happened?\" Quenthel asked. \"Where is the goddess if not in the Abyss?\" \"All your questions will be answered, Mistress,\" said the widow, \"when you pass through the gate.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a plane all its own now,\" Pharaun guessed.\\n\\n The abyssal widows all nodded in unison and moved to stand on either side of the portal-guards along a procession route.\\n\\n \"You have come this far,\" one of the widows said.\\n\\n \"And so have proved you are worthy,\" continued another.\\n\\n \"To face Lolth and speed her into her new form,\" finished the third.\\n\\n \"Her new form?\" asked Pharaun.\\n\\n The abyssal widows all shared a coy look and gestured to the yawning violet portal.\\n\\n \"Did you . . .\" the Master of Sorcere said, his throat dry, his hands shaking no matter how hard he tried to stop them. \"Did you call yourself a midwife?\" \"Pass,\" one of them said. \"You are expected.\"\\n\\n Quenthel stepped forward, Danifae close on her heels, and boldly walked into the roiling mass of purple light. She disappeared instantly, Danifae only steps behind her. Jeggred was a bit more reluctant, regarding the abyssal widows with blazing eyes as he passed them. Soon enough, he was gone as well.\\n\\n Pharaun turned to Valas, whose eyes were darting from one widow to another. He had a hand on one of the many garish trinkets he wore pinned to his vest. \"So, Master Hune,\" Pharaun said, \"here we are.\"\\n\\n Valas looked at him and nodded.\\n\\n \"Where we\u0027re going . . .\" the wizard said, pausing to gather his thoughts-not easy with the prospect of stepping through that particular portal looming so close. \"It could be that your services are no longer required.\"\\n\\n Valas locked his eyes on Pharaun\u0027s and said, \"My services are no longer adequate.\"\\n\\n Pharaun took a deep breath.\\n\\n \"Well,\" the wizard said, \"as I said before, we would benefit from your skills and experience wherever we go, but here we\u0027ve come to a point where you must make a decision.\"\\n\\n \"I have,\" said Valas, the look in his eye inviting no more conversation. \"Yes, well,\" Pharaun said, \"there it is.\"\\n\\n The wizard turned and without a backward glance stepped into the portal, leaving Valas Hune behind. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/annihilation-war-of-the-spider-queen-5/page-28.html","bookId":2163,"book":{"id":2163,"title":"Annihilation (War of the Spider Queen #5)","description":"Storyline: Annihilation: War of the Spider Queen, Book V (R.A Salvatore Presents the War of the Spider Queen) \\n The fifth title in the New York Times best-selling saga of civil war and chaos in the darkest part of the Forgotten Realms setting.
