{"id":97659,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"Danifae sat on the floor of the gatehouse for what felt like a very long time. She hadn\u0027t allowed herself to think too much about her life before her captivity. There were only a few ways to survive as a battle-captive, including convincingyourself that you\u0027ve always been one.\\n\\n Before the raid that put her in the hands of House Melarn, Danifae had been taking lessons from the Yauntyrr House Mage. Zinnirit was a capable and detail-oriented teacher, and Danifae had learned much from him, especially in the fields of teleportation, translocation, and dimensional travel. They hadn\u0027t actually begun her study of the arcane Art before her House was overwhelmed, but Zinnirit had familiarized the young daughter of House Yauntyrr with a variety of enchanted items.\\n\\n Danifae touched her mother\u0027s ring, feeling the cold metal warming against her skin. The ring could bounce her across the Underdark-but just her and one other. Danifae had plans that required more than that.\\n\\n Her eyes settled on the still hand of the dead wizard.\\n\\n \"More rings,\" Danifae whispered, a smile playing at the corners of her mouth. All she had to do was remember how to work them.\\n\\n Even as the uridezu was bringing his tail around for another hard slap at Quenthel, Jeggred pounced on him. The draegloth caught the heavy appendage in his larger set of hands. The tail\u0027s momentum, stopped so abruptly by the draegloth\u0027s grip, staggered the uridezu and it toppled in a heap onto the ruined rail. Jagged bits of bone cut deeply into the demon\u0027s already bleeding body. At the same time, all five of the vipers from Quenthel\u0027s scourge bit into sensitive areas, released, then bit again. Waves of agony pulsed through the demon\u0027s body, and it coughed out phlegm and blood.\\n\\n \"We . . .\" the demon gasped. \"We will see you in the Abyss . . . drow bitch!\" We? Pharaun thought, stealing a glance at Raashub, who was watching with keen interest.\\n\\n \"Kill it now, Jeggred,\" Quenthel commanded, her voice still husky and mingled with deep, panting breaths. \"Kill it before it goes home.\"\\n\\n Feral light flashed in the draegloth\u0027s eyes and he brought a single claw across the uridezu\u0027s midsection. The daggerlike talon disappeared into the demon\u0027s flesh, burying itself six inches deep. Jeggred cut the thing\u0027s belly open wide enough to spill a pile of ropy yellow intestines, steaming with the demon\u0027s hot blood, onto the deck of the ship of chaos.\\n\\n The demon screamed, the sound echoing unnaturally then fading even as the uridezu itself began to evaporate into nothingness. It was returning to the Abyss while it still lived.\\n\\n Pharaun had to admit that he wasn\u0027t sure how long a demon might live after it had been disemboweled, but more than one breed of them could regenerate completely from even so grievous a wound.\\n\\n As the demon began to fade, though, Jeggred quickly withdrew his claw and grabbed the uridezu\u0027s head in both his larger, stronger hands. The draegloth twisted and pulled, hard enough that Pharaun could see veins protrude against his straining muscles.\\n\\n There was a sickly wet cracking sound and a sicker wet pop! and the uridezu\u0027s head came off in Jeggred\u0027s hands.\\n\\n The rest of the demon\u0027s body disappeared, but the head and entrails remained. The black eyes stared, dead, at nothing. The demon\u0027s guts slowly sizzled away, being absorbed, Pharaun noted, by the ship itself. The wizard realized that most of the fragments of bone from the shattered rail had gone as well. The ship was feeding on itself, repairing the damage bone by bone.\\n\\n Jeggred, obviously taking no notice of the ship of chaos\u0027s convenient regenerative capacities, tossed the uridezu\u0027s head overboard as he turned to face the captain.\\n\\n Raashub, already backed away as far as his bonds would allow, put his hands up in supplication and looked away.\\n\\n Jeggred, a low growl rumbling in his throat, started forward, stalking the bound uridezu with unveiled intent.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know, nephew,\" Quenthel said, her voice and breathing slowly returning to normal. She was bleeding but paid her injuries no heed. \"I have yet to make up my mind.\"\\n\\n The vipers seethed at the end of her whip, and Quenthel glanced at one of them as if she\u0027d heard it speak-and certainly she had, though Pharaun was still not privy to that communication.\\n\\n \"Wait,\" the wizard said, stepping closer but not foolish enough to move between Jeggred and the uridezu. \"I\u0027m afraid we still need him.\"\\n\\n Jeggred growled, not looking at Pharaun, but he did hesitate.\\n\\n \"It was to be expected,\" Pharaun said. \"You\u0027ve both worked with demons before, haven\u0027t you? So he tried to kill us and failed.\"\\n\\n Quenthel\u0027s head snapped to look at him. The abrupt motion caused the vipers in her whip to shudder and turn on the wizard as well.\\n\\n \"You can\u0027t control him,\" she said to Pharaun. \"How can you stop him from doing that again?\"\\n\\n \"It wasn\u0027t me, Mistress,\" Raashubpleaded, his voice reedy and dripping with false humility. \"The Lake of Shadows is home to many of my kind.\"\\n\\n Pharaun lifted an eyebrow at that obvious lie then began to cast a spell.\\n\\n \"Let me eat his kidneys,\" Jeggred growled, his eyes still locked on the uridezu. \"Maybe just one kidney.\"\\n\\n Pharaun, ignoring the draegloth, finished his spell.\\n\\n Raashub screamed.\\n\\n The sound was so sudden and so loud that even Jeggred stepped back from it. Wild horror passed through the captive uridezu in visible waves. Raashub threw up his hands and clawed at the air in front of him, whimpering, sobbing, and shrieking in different combinations as Pharaun, Quenthel, and Jeggred looked on.\\n\\n \"What are you doing to him?\" Jeggred asked, confused.\\n\\n \"Showing him things,\" Pharaun replied.\\n\\n He looked at Quenthel, who obviously wanted a more detailed explanation.\\n\\n \"Even demons have nightmares, Mistress,\" the Master of Sorcere explained. \"My spell is letting a few of those play out for him. I assure you both, it is an experience our dear friend Raashub will not soon forget, and he knows I can do it again.\"\\n\\n Jeggred sighed so heavily Pharaun could smell his rancid breath. The draegloth moved toward Raashub.\\n\\n \"Hold, Jeggred,\" Quenthel ordered.\\n\\n The draegloth hesitated before doing so, but he did stop.\\n\\n \"Raashub still serves a purpose,\" the high priestess said as she began to assess her injuries.\\n\\n Jeggred turned to look at her, but she ignored him.\\n\\n \"Who told you that?\" the draegloth asked in a low growl. \"The dandy?\"-he nodded at Pharaun-\"or the snakes?\"\\n\\n Quenthel ignored the question, but Pharaun thought long and hard about it.\\n\\n It took Danifae somewhat longer than she\u0027d intended to remember Zinnirit\u0027s favorite command words and determine which of them powered which of the rings. Then she turned her attention to studying the finer points of the portals she had \"inherited\" from the late Yauntyrr House mage. Not only had she lost all track of time as she studied Zinnirit\u0027s collection of scrolls and tomes on the subject, made a few exploratory scans through open portals, and ignored a summons from Valas, but she had exhausted the limits of her own familiarity with the arcane Art. Danifae was no wizard, but fortunately she didn\u0027t have to be to use many of the features of Zinnirit\u0027s gatehouse.\\n\\n The gates were used primarily for transportation-whisking someone or something hundreds, even thousands of miles in the blink of an eye-but they could also be used to find someone. Though the strong psychic link that the Binding had provided was gone, Danifae still had some connection to her former mistress. She knew Halisstra better than anyone ever had, even ranking members of House Melarn. Halisstra\u0027s sister had tried to kill her, and her mother had always been the model of the aloof, controlling matron mother. Danifae, though always seething with hate, had served Halisstra loyally and well every minute of every day.\\n\\n Ultimately all Danifae really had to do was remember her. All she had to do was imagine what Halisstra looked like, visualize her, and activate one of the portals in precisely the right way. At least, she thought that was all she needed to do.\\n\\n After several false starts and failed attempts, Danifae stepped away from the gate and began pacing. As she did she fiddled with a ring on her finger, then another ring on her other hand, and- She stopped and looked at her hands. Danifae had taken three rings from the dead wizard. Two of them were tucked safely in a pocket. She wore the ring that Zinnirit had created for her mother, the one that would bring her back to the gatehouse from anywhere, but she wore another ring as well-one she\u0027d almost forgotten about. It belonged to Ryld Argith, the Menzoberranyr weapons master who, like Danifae\u0027s former mistress, had abandoned the expedition.\\n\\n They had been spending some time with each other, Ryld and Halisstra. Even in the cave where Pharaun had summoned the demon Belshazu, Danifae had suspected that Ryld was sneaking off to join Halisstra. If he had, she could use his ring as a focus.\\n\\n It was only after several more false starts that Danifae finally found her mistress. The former battle-captive had been, like the Menzoberranyr, under the impression that Halisstra had gone to the City of Spiders to report on their progress (or lack thereof), and much of Danifae\u0027s time had been spent searching for her there. Hours later, Danifae realized that Halisstra wasn\u0027t even in the Underdark but in the bizarre landscape of the World Above. Danifae had suspected that Halisstra was in the process of turning entirely from the worship of Lolth. They had all seen her reaction to the chaotic, empty Demonweb Pits.\\n\\n Even having seen that ruined plane herself, though, Danifae had been a priestess of Lolth when she was free and living in Eryndlyn, and she had served the goddess more faithfully and more sincerely than she served House Melarn ever since, so her faith remained strong. Guarded, perhaps, more curious, but strong. Danifae wouldn\u0027t presume to question the goddess\u0027s will, and Halisstra\u0027s commitment to the Spider Queen was none of Danifae\u0027s concern. Danifae could easily enough set aside her religion if necessary, but she would never set aside her vengeance. Halisstra Melarn had to die, and not on Lolth\u0027s behalf. For Danifae it was a simple imperative.\\n\\n As certain as she could be that the portal was properly tuned to the place on the World Above where Halisstra and Ryld were, Danifae stepped through. She felt as if she were being turned upside down and inside out at the same time, though there was no pain-only a dull, throbbing vertigo-then she was there.\\n\\n It was night, and Danifae thanked Lolth for that. Her eyes still had to adjust to the bright glare of the starlight against the white snow, but she wasn\u0027t totally blinded. She had appeared, apparently silently and without the sort of fanfare-flashing lights and thunderclaps-that often accompanied arcane magic, in front of a ruined building. The structure was overgrown with vegetation. No light or fire glowed from inside.\\n\\n Danifae drew her piwafwi close around her shoulders against the biting cold in the air. Shestepped as quietly as she could to the entrance. Her eyes adjusted little by little, and by the time Danifae reached the ruin, she could see fairly well. Inside, Halisstra sat back to back with Ryld. The two of them were deep in Reverie and in a position that told Danifae everything she needed to know about their relationship.\\n\\n The former battle-captive felt a growing respect for Halisstra, as well as a growing contempt. Halisstra had managed to outwit Quenthel and the others, seduce the steadfast weapons master-admirable, even for someone schooled her entire life in manipulation and deceit-and had set up a sweet little household for them in the freezing, animal-infested forest-a bizarre and unseemly act of betrayal against her essential nature as a dark elf.\\n\\n Danifae took a deep breath and let it out in a thin, reedy whistle. Halisstra came out of Reverie without a blink and looked at her. The First Daughter of House Melarn had established that sound as their signal years before, and they had both had occasion to use it more than once.\\n\\n Halisstra let one side of her mouth draw up into half a smile. She indicated Ryld with a slow movement of her eyes, and Danifae shook her head.\\n\\n Halisstra stood slowly and carefully, making sure not to disturb Ryld.\\n\\n \"Are you all right?\" the weapons master whispered, his eyes still closed. Halisstra replied, also in a whisper, \"I\u0027m fine. I\u0027ll be right back.\"\\n\\n Ryld nodded and returned to his meditation as Halisstra slipped out of the ruined structure. Certain that Ryld hadn\u0027t seen her, Danifae led her former mistress a good distance from the ruin, waiting for Halisstra to indicate they\u0027d gone far enough. They stopped and faced each other for the first time as two free drow.\\n\\n The Binding?Halisstra signed.\\n\\n Danifae replied, Removed by Quenthel. . . Pharaun, really, but on Quenthel\u0027s orders. We have found a ship of chaos to take us back to the Abyss.\\n\\n Halisstra visibly withdrew and signed, I can see why you escaped.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t, really, replied Danifae. I was sent with Master Hune to gather supplies for our doomed little voyage.\\n\\n How long before they leave? Halisstra asked.\\n\\n Days still, answered Danifae.\\n\\n Why are you telling me this? Halisstra asked. You\u0027re free now. Go back to Eryndlyn if you dare, or go on with the Menzoberranyr until you all inevitably die. Do as you wish, but you no longer need seek my permission.\\n\\n I served you, Danifae replied, and now I serve Quenthel. I\u0027m not as free as you might think, Binding or no Binding.\\n\\n There was a short silence as the two of them studied each other in the darkness. Danifae could somehow feel how far Halisstra had strayed from the path of Lolth, but it was confirmed seconds later by Halisstra herself.\\n\\n I serve Eilistraee now, Danifae. There will be no more slaves for me.\\n\\n Danifae pretended to consider that last statement for a while. Internally she tried to get her head to stop spinning. The depth of her former mistress\u0027s betrayal was worse than she\u0027d imagined. Danifae couldn\u0027t believe she\u0027d ever allowed herself to be taken captive by so weak a mistress-one who would turn her back on her entire culture at the slightest provocation, at the first sign of weakness. It was that thought that snapped Danifae out of her confusion.\\n\\n Halisstra must have seen Lolth\u0027s Silence as a sign of weakness and used that opportunity to escape, just as Danifae had seen Halisstra\u0027s doubt as a sign of weakness and used that opportunity to escape herself. But would any priestess seek to escape the service of Lolth?\\n\\n I like the sound of that, Danifae signed, but we are all slaves sooner or later.\\n\\n We don\u0027t have to be, Halisstra was quick to reply.\\n\\n Danifae blinked at how strident, how obvious, and how careless her former mistress had become.\\n\\n Lolth isn\u0027t coming back, is she? Danifae asked.\\n\\n I don\u0027t know, replied Halisstra, but it doesn\u0027t look good.\\n\\n If I die still serving her, Danifae asked, where will my soul go? There were no drow souls in the Demonweb Pits, and no entrance past the sealed doors. Where are all those souls?\\n\\n Halisstra looked at her former servant with a wounded, open look that made Danifae\u0027s skin crawl.\\n\\n What, Danifae asked, are your intentions here?\\n\\n You found me, her former mistress replied. Tell me, what are your intentions? Spying on me for that Baenre bureaucrat?\\n\\n No, Danifae replied sharply. I sneaked away from Valas in Sschindylryn. It was the only place to find a portal and to find you, I don\u0027t trust the Menzoberranyr.\\n\\n Why would you? Halisstra replied, eyeing her former servant carefully.\\n\\n What is the weapons master doing here? asked Danifae.\\n\\n She could see by Halisstra\u0027s reaction that things between she and the weapons master had gone a considerable distance toward the bizarre. The light and air of the World Above must have affected Halisstra in unpredictable ways. Danifae marveled at how such a thing might be possible.\\n\\n You sit in Reverie against his back? Danifae asked.\\n\\n Halisstra drew herself to her full height and tried to recapture the manner of a slaveholder. Danifae was unwilling to play the part of the battle-captive.\\n\\n Instead of flying into a rage, Halisstra simply relaxed.\\n\\n Do you sit the same way with Quenthel? Halisstra signed.\\n\\n Danifae made a convincing show of being uncomfortable with that question. She was intimate with Quenthel not out of some alien emotion like love or compassion but because Quenthel could help her. Quenthel, in turn, used Danifae for physical pleasure and to gain a toady. It was all perfectly natural. Halisstra, however, seemed to have turned a corner with Ryld Argith, and that was something Danifae knew she could exploit.\\n\\n You said that Quenthel is taking the expedition back to the Abyss, Halisstra signed, changing the subject. Why? Why that way? Why all that?\\n\\n Danifae could have given her some of the reasons, but some were still not clear to her.\\n\\n I can explain all, Danifae lied, but I must return to Sschindylryn. Valas will grow suspicious, then he\u0027ll leave without me. I have to go back to the Underdark then back to the Lake of Shadows. I will contact you again.\\n\\n Halisstra looked her up and down, appraising her.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll be waiting,\" Halisstra whispered in Danifae\u0027s ear.\\n\\n Danifae nodded, gave Halisstra a slight bow, and did her best to look at the First Daughter of House Melarn with a face full of sisterhood and friendliness. When Halisstra disappeared into the dark forest, Danifae signed after her, We\u0027ll meet again very soon, Halisstra Melarn. Sooner than you think.\\n\\n Danifae touched the ring she\u0027d taken from the dying Zinnirit, and a second or two of bizarre sensation later and she was back at the gatehouse.\\n\\n Perfect, thought Danifae. It worked perfectly. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/annihilation-war-of-the-spider-queen-5/page-11.html","bookId":2163,"book":{"id":2163,"title":"Annihilation (War of the Spider Queen #5)","description":"Storyline: Annihilation: War of the Spider Queen, Book V (R.A Salvatore Presents the War of the Spider Queen) \\n The fifth title in the New York Times best-selling saga of civil war and chaos in the darkest part of the Forgotten Realms setting.
