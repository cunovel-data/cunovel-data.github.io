{"id":97651,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"The demon steered them to the darkest part of the lake, and not one of the drow thought anything of it. Bobbing at anchor in the deep gloom of the Lake of Shadows, the ship of chaos-Raashub\u0027s ship of chaos-stood out stark white against the inky darkness. The water itself was a black matched only by the deep ebony of his drow master\u0027s skin. The wizard, theone they called Pharaun, had found him, bound him, chained him to his own deck, and had done so with no humility, no respect, and no fear. The thought of it made the wiry black hairs that dotted the demon\u0027s wrinkled gray flesh stand on end. For a few moments, the demon stood reveling in the hatred he felt for that drow and his haughty kin.\n The drow had been gating in one servile, simpering, weak-willed mane after another. The damned souls of petty sinners were food in the Abyss, and they were food for the ship of chaos. The uridezu took note of the number of manes the drow wizard brought in at any given time in hopes of gauging the dark elf\u0027s power. If it was an exact science, the gating in of lesser demons, Raashub didn\u0027t know its finer points, but so many of them were coming through there could be no doubt that the drow was skilled. Raashub wasn\u0027t helping the drow and was happy to let them not only feed his ship but exhaust their spells, efforts, and attention in the process. The presence of all those wailing, miserable demons must have clouded the drow priestess\u0027s senses enough that at times Raashub could push the boundaries of his captivity.\n A rat\u0027s primitive consciousness intruded on his own, and Raashub sent only the tiniest hint of a glance its way. He\u0027d been calling them, subtly, for two days-ever since the drow had first come aboard. The rodents swam the surface of the Lake of Shadows, and they inhabited the spaces between decks and under steps on the ship of chaos the same way rats everywhere swam, hid, and survived. Raashub,an uridezu, was as much rat as anything else a mundane prime could understand, and he knew the rats of the Underdark as he knew rats in every corner of the endless planes.\n The rodent responded to Raashub\u0027s glance with a silent twitch of its whiskers, a gesture the uridezu felt more than saw. It scurried behind the thick base of the main mast and crept cautiously toward the draegloth.\n They called the half-breed Jeggred. As draegloths went he was an average specimen. If Raashub were stupid enough to engage him, the draegloth would win a one-on-one fight, but the uridezu would never be that stupid. He would never be as stupid as the draegloth.\n The rat didn\u0027t want to bite the half-demon, and Raashub had to silently insist. It was a gamble, but the uridezu didn\u0027t mind the odd risk for the odder reward. His psychic urging drew the attention of one of the female drow again, though, and the uridezu backed off, looking away before they made eye contact. All of the drow deferred, if grudgingly, to the female named Quenthel, who was apparently some high priestess of the drow spider-bitch Lolth. That one was as conceited and as unworthy of that conceit as the rest of them, but she was sensitive. Raashub worried that she could actually hear him when he didn\u0027t want her to.\n Darting in fast, the rat nipped at the draegloth\u0027s ankle. The half-demon swatted it away with a grunt, and the tiny rodent flew through the air, out into the darkness. The splash was almost too far away to hear. The draegloth, whose skin was unmarred by the puny creature\u0027s teeth, locked his eyes on Raashub\u0027s and glared at him.\n The draegloth had been doing little the past two days but glare at him. Annoying little vermin, Raashub sent into the draegloth\u0027s mind, aren\u0027t they, Jeggred?\n The draegloth blew a short, vile-smelling breath out of his nostrils and his lips peeled slowly back to reveal fangs-rows of dagger blades as sharp as razors and as piercing as needles. The half-demon hissed his anger, and boiling spittle sizzled on his lips.\n Pretty, Raashub taunted.\n The draegloth\u0027s eyes narrowed in confusion. Raashub allowed himself to laugh. The high priestess turned and looked at them both. Again, Raashub avoided eye contact. He moved his foot enough to let the chain that bound him rattle against the single dragon bone that comprised most of the deck of his ship. Above him, the tattered sails of human skin hung limp in the still air. The demon heard Jeggred turn. Raashub liked the game-they were both caught by a sternly disapproving mother in their boyish mischief.\n Quenthel looked away, and Jeggred locked his eyes on Raashub again. The uridezu didn\u0027t bother taunting him anymore that day. It was becoming boring. Instead, the demon contented himself with standing quietly, occasionally nudging the ship a little closer to the deeper gloom along the cavern wall.\n Patience was not normally a quality enjoyed by his kind, but Raashub had been trapped in the Lake of Shadows for a long time. The appearance of the drow had been something of a godsend-though by the tone of their conversations and the snippets of facts regarding their mission the drow had let slip, Raashub knew it was hardly a god or goddess who\u0027d sent them. They had managed to release his ship and release him. If he was anything but an uridezu, a demon born in the whirling chaos of Mother Abyss, he might have been . . . ah, what was the word? Grateful? Instead, he was patient, a little patient for a little longer. Soon the drow would slip into their Reverie, their meditative trance so like sleep, and the high priestess would look inward. When that time came and she couldn\u0027t sense what he was doing, Raashub would bring another of his kind across the limitless infinity between planes. He had already called one of them the day before. The drow, over-confident in their measure of control over him, hadn\u0027t sensed him calling, failed to notice his cousin Jaershed cross from the Abyss, and still didn\u0027t realize that the other uridezu was even then clinging to the keel, wrapped in conjured darkness, waiting.\n Jaershed hadn\u0027t learned patience the way Raashub had, and the lust for blood and chaos sometimes came out of him in waves. When it did the damnable high priestess would look around as if she\u0027d heard something, as if she thought she were being watched. Raashub would silently wail, then, adding his mental voice to the anguished moans of the parade of manes they brought in and led into the hold one by one. Quenthel would be curious, disturbed even, but she would ultimately believe.\n The dark elves had bested Raashub after all. Their powerful mage had trapped him on that miserable plane, chained him to his own deck, cowed him, enslaved him . . . and none of them could imagine that as true as that was, nothing-not in the Abyss, the Underdark, the Lake of Shadows, or aboard a ship of bone and chaos-lasted forever.\n Raashub closed his eyes, suppressed his anticipation, and smiled.\n Ryld Argith peered into the darkness of the Velarswood night and sighed. In the places where the trees were tall enough and close enough together to block out the star-spattered sky, it almost felt comfortable for him, but those times were few and far between in what the weapons master had come to learn was a relatively small forest. The sounds didn\u0027t help-whistles and rustling all the time from every direction, often not echoing at all. His hearing, sensitized by decades of training at Melee-Magthere, was tuned to the peculiarities of the Underdark, but in the World Above, it was making him a nervous wreck. The forest seemed always alive with enemies.\n He turned to scan the darkness for the source of some random twittering-something he\u0027d been told was a \"night bird\"-and instead he caught Halisstra\u0027s eye. She knew what he was doing-startling at every sound-and she smiled at him in a way that only days before Ryld would have taken as a sign that she\u0027d identified a weakness in him, one that she\u0027d surely exploit later. The twinkle in her crimson eyes seemed to imply the opposite.\n Halisstra Melarn had confused Ryld from the beginning of their acquaintance. The First Daughter of a noble House from Ched Nasad, at first she had been every inch the haughty, self-possessed priestess she\u0027d been raised to be, but as her goddess turned her back on her, her House fell, then her city crumbled around it, Halisstra had changed. Ryld abandoned his long-time ally Pharaun and the rest of the Menzoberranyr to go with her, and he didn\u0027t regret that, but he wasn\u0027t sure he could turn his back forever on the Underdark the way she so obviously had. Ryld still had a home in Menzoberranzan-at least he assumed he did, absent any news from the city that was already feeling the effects of Lolth\u0027s Silence when they\u0027d left. When he thought about it, he felt certain that someday he would return there. When he looked at Halisstra he saw a dark elf like him but also unlike him. He knew that she would never be able to go back, even if she had a House to go back to. She was different, and Ryld knew that eventually he would have to change too or go home without her.\n \"Are you all right?\" she asked him, her voice a welcome respite from the cacophony of the forest.\n He met her eyes but wasn\u0027t sure how to answer. Thanks to the Eilistraeen priestesses Uluyara and Feliane, he was not only alive but unwounded. The poison that had nearly claimed him had been pulled from his blood by their magic, and his wounds and Halisstra\u0027s had been healed, leaving not even scars to mark their passage. The alien goddess of the surface drow had granted him his life, and Ryld was still waiting for her or her followers to present a bill.\n \"Ryld?\" Halisstra prompted.\n \"I\u0027m-\"\n He stopped, turned his head, and when he heard Halisstra inhale to speak again, he held up a warning hand to silence her.\n Something was moving, and it was close. It was on the ground, and it was moving toward them. He knew that Feliane had gone ahead of them-the Eilistraeeans were always sensitive about giving the two newcomers time alone-but she was farther away and in a different direction.\n Behind you, he signaled to Halisstra, and to the left.\n Halisstra nodded, and her right hand moved to the enchanted blade at her hip. Ryld watched her turn, slowly, and as he drew his own mighty greatsword from his back, he took the briefest moment to admire the curve of Halisstra\u0027s hip, her mail glittering in the starlight against the dark background of the forest. Her feet whispered in the snow, and Ryld tracked the sounds. Whatever it was wasn\u0027t moving in a very deliberate way, and it sounded as if there was more than one, though the lack of echoes still made it hard for him to be sure. He didn\u0027t detect any change in the way it was moving when either of them drew their swords, so Ryld thought it unlikely the trespasser had heard them.\n A spindly plant devoid of green-the Eilistraeeans had called one like it a \"bush\"-quivered, but not from the wind. Halisstra stepped back and held the Crescent Blade in the guard position in front of her. She had her back to him, so Ryld couldn\u0027t communicate with her in sign language. He wanted to tell her to step back farther, to let him take care of whatever it was, but he didn\u0027t want to speak.\n When the thing rolled out from behind the bush, Halisstra hopped back three fast steps, keeping her sword at the ready. Ryld rushed at the bundle of bristly brown fur assuming Halisstra would clear the rest of the space for him. When she didn\u0027t he was forced to stop, and it looked up at him. The closest thing to the creature Ryld had ever seen was a rothe, but it was no rothe. The creature was small, the size and weight of Ryld\u0027storso, and its wide eyes were wet and innocent, weak and- \"Young,\" Halisstra whispered, as if she was finishing his thought.\n Ryld didn\u0027t let down his guard, though the beast sat calmly on the ground, looking at him.\n \"It\u0027s a baby,\" Halisstra said, and slipped the Crescent Blade back into her scabbard.\n \"What is it?\" Ryld asked, still not ready to let down his guard, much less sheathe his sword.\n \"I have no idea,\" Halisstra answered, but still she crouched in front of it. \"Halisstra,\" Ryld hissed, \"for Lolth\u0027s-\"\n He stopped himself before he finished that thought. It was another habit he would have to change or take home with him.\n \"It\u0027s not going to eat us, Ryld,\" she whispered, looking the little creature in the eyes.\n Its nose twitched at her, and its eyes held hers. It seemed curious, with a face vaguely elflike, but its gaze betrayed an animal\u0027s intelligence and no more. \"What are you going to do with it?\" he asked.\n Halisstra shrugged.\n Before Ryld could say anything else, two more of the little animals wandered out of the bushes to regard their comrade and the two dark elves with a meek curiosity.\n \"Feliane will know what to do with them,\" Halisstra said, \"or at least be able to tell us what they are.\"\n It was Ryld\u0027s turn to shrug. One of the creatures was licking itself, and even Ryld wasn\u0027t wrapped so tight that he could still see them as a threat. Halisstra sent out a call the Eilistraeeans had taught them-the sound of some bird-and Ryld slipped his greatsword back into its scabbard.\n Feliane would hear the call and come to them. Ryld cringed when he realized that when she got there and saw the two of them dumb-rounded by what looked like harmless prey animals . . . they would both look foolish again. At least, Ryld would.\n Feliane came stomping through the underbrush. Ryld was surprised by not only how fast the Eilistraeen was moving but by how loud she was. He\u0027d come to respect their ability to slip through the forest un- He realized at that moment that what he heard crashing at them through the pitch-black forest wasn\u0027t Feliane. It wasn\u0027t a drow, or a surface elf, or even a human. It was something else-something big.\n The thing burst out of the thick tangle of underbrush like an advancing wall of matted brown fur. Ryld managed to get his hand on Splitter\u0027s pommel but couldn\u0027t draw it before the beast rolled over him. The weapons master tried to tuck his body to protect his belly from the monster\u0027s trampling claws, but he didn\u0027t have the time.\n The creature stomped on him, tripped on him, rolled on him, then stepped on him. All Ryld could do was keep his eyes pressed closed and grunt. It was heavy, and when it first punched him into the ground Ryld heard then felt at least one of his ribs snap under its weight. It finally came off him, and Ryld rolled off to one side-any side-ending up curled under a spindly \"bush\" with thorns that harried at his armor and piwafwi. Snow packed into the spaces between his armor\u0027s plates and chilled his neck and hands.\n The creature stopped, rolling all the way over in the end and coming back onto its feet still facing away from Ryld. The weapons master looked up and blinked at it. It looked like a bigger-much bigger-version of the little animals that had wandered up to twitch their noses at the drow. It was a clever ruse and surely a successful hunting strategy: Disarm and distract your preywith your curious young, then trample it into the ground when it isn\u0027t looking.\n Still, the Master of Melee-Magthere grimaced at his having fallen for it, however clever it was.\n I\u0027m getting slow, he thought. All this open air, all this talk of goddesses and redemption . . .\n Shaking the distracting thoughts from his mind, Ryld spun to his feet at the same time he drew Splitter and whirled it in frontof him. The lumbering animal turned to face him, and Ryld was ready for it.\n The beast looked him in the eye and Ryld winked at it over the razor edge of his greatsword.\n Steam puffed from its nostrils as it coughed out a series of loud grunts. It scratched at the snow with one of its front paws, and Ryld saw its black claws, the size of hunting knives, at the end of surprisingly well articulated hands. The look in the creature\u0027s eyes was a mix of slow-wittedness and feral anger-a look Ryld had seen before and had learned to respect. Stupid foes were easy to defeat and angry foes even easier. Mix the two together, though, and you\u0027re in for a fight.\n The beast charged, and Ryld obliged it by meeting it in the middle. When it reared up at the end of its charge, the animal was nearly three times the drow\u0027s height. That display would likely frighten lesser opponents, but for Ryld all it did was open the thing\u0027s belly. The weapons master brought his greatsword in fast at shoulder height in a hard slash meant to open the animal\u0027s gut and end it quickly. The beast was faster than it looked, though, and it fell backward, rolling onto its back as the edge of Ryld\u0027s sword flashed past it, missing by a foot or more.Ryld had no choice but to follow through with the swing, but he managed to make use of the inertia to send him dodging off to the left when the creature slashed at him with its hind claws.\n Ryld spun to a halt, blade up high, while the animal continued its roll and flipped back onto its feet. Both of them blew steam into the frigid air, but only Ryld smiled.\n They went at each other again, and Ryld was ready for it to try to either trample him or rear up again. The animal did neither. It reached out for the drow warrior with both hands, obviously trying to grab him by the shoulders-or by the head. Ryld slid toward it at the end of his run, stabbing up with his greatsword as he passed under the animal\u0027s chin. He intended to impale it, maybe even behead it, but his opponent proved still more surprisingly agile. It ducked its head to one side, and all Ryld managed to do was nick one of its ears. The weapons master continued his slide, bringing his arms in so he could stab again and at least get the creature in the gut, but the animal jumped to one side and rolled off, again managing to elude the drow\u0027s attack.\n Ryld hopped to his feet, and the two opponents faced each other again. Ryld heard a voice to his left and glanced over to see Halisstra, bent in an attitude of prayer, mumbling her way through some kind of chant. The animal took advantage of Ryld\u0027s momentary attention gap and leaped at him, clearing easily eight feet before crashing to the ground in front of the drow. The creature had to dodge back, unbalancing itself, to avoid another slash from Splitter. It opened its jaws wide, revealing nasty fangs, and let loose another series of angry, frustrated grunts.\n It swiped at Ryld with one set of claws. Ryld was ready to meet it, fully engaged to sever the animal\u0027s front leg at the elbow-when both of them jerked backward to avoid something that whizzed through the air between them in a flurry of feathers, talons, and turbulent air.\n Ryld followed the animal\u0027s eyes as it followed the new player\u0027s mad course through the air. It was some kind of bird, but with four wings. Its multicolored feathers blended well into the dark background of the forest, and Ryld actually lost sight of it for a second. The huge furry beast stepped back, trying to look at Ryld and look out for the bird-thing at the same time.\n Even Ryld wasn\u0027t able to do that, and since the furry animal was in front of him and at least a little off its guard, the weapons master stepped in to attack again-and again the bird-thing flashed between them, raking the air with its needle-like talons.\n Ryld barely twitched away, but the big animal all but fell onto its back to avoid the newcomer. Ryld, already in mid-slash, quickly changed the direction of his attack and was half an inch from cutting the fast-flying bird-thing in half when Halisstra called out from behind him.\n \"Wait!\" she shouted, and Ryld tipped the point of his blade down barely enough to let the bird fly past. \"It\u0027s mine. I summoned it.\"\n Ryld didn\u0027t have time to ask her how she\u0027d managed to do that. Instead he stepped back three long strides, keeping his eyes on thebeast, which was already back on its feet. The bird-thing slashed in from the darkness behind the animal and dragged its talons acrossthe beast\u0027s head. The creature howled in pain and surprise and snapped its jaws at the passing bird-thing, missing it by a yard or more.\n \"What is that?\" Ryld asked, not looking at Halisstra but keeping his eyes on the furious forest animal.\n \"It\u0027s an arrowhawk,\" Halisstra answered.\n Ryld could hear the pride and surprise in her voice, and something about that sent a chill down his spine.\n The animal looked at him, grunted, and came on. Either it had forgotten about the arrowhawk or had given up trying to see it coming. Ryld crouched, Splitter out in front of him, awaiting the beast\u0027s charge. He kept his shoulders loose and told himself that the fight had gone on long enough. He was not going to be made a fool of by- -and the arrowhawk swished over his head, missing the top of his close-cropped white hair by a finger\u0027s width.\n Ryld tucked his head down as it shot over him. The bird flew as fast as an arrow shot from a longbow, and it was easy for Ryld to understand how the creature had received its name. It looked as if the hawk was flying straight for the furry creature\u0027s eyes. Half of Ryld wanted the arrowhawk to kill it, the other half didn\u0027t want to be shown up by some conjured bird. At least not in front of- That thought too went unfinished when Ryld heard himself gasp at the sight of the huge ground animal grabbing the arrowhawk right out of the air with one huge, clawed hand.\n The bird let out an ear-rattling squawk, and the creature looked it in the eyes as it started to squeeze. Ryld didn\u0027t doubt for a moment that the big animal could break the long, slender arrowhawk in two with one hand. It was half a second away from doing just that when the arrowhawk flipped its long, feathered tail up and pointed it at the animal\u0027s face. An eye-searing flash of blinding light arced from the arrowhawk\u0027s tail to the tip of the animal\u0027s nose. Ryld snapped his eyes shut and gritted his teeth against the pain. There was a loud rustle of leathers, another angry squawk, and a high-pitched wail that could only have come from the big ground animal.\n Ryld opened his eyes and had to blink away an afterimage of the graceful purple spark that had shot from the arrowhawk\u0027s tail. The animal had let go of the bird, which was nowhere to be seen. A tendril of smoke rose from its burned nose, and the stench of singed hair quickly filled the still night air. Halisstra stepped up to Ryld, and they shared a glance and a smile as the big animal writhed in pain.\n \"Not bad,\" the weapons master joked, and Halisstra responded with a pleased smile.\n \"Praise Eilistraee,\" she said.\n As if it understood her and had no love for her goddess, the big animal looked up, coughed out two more feral grunts, and started at them. Ryld put out one hand to push Halisstra behind him, but she had already skipped back into the darkness. He set his feet, ready for the charge, and saw the arrowhawk shoot out of the darkness again. The arrowhawk whipped its tail forward, and Ryld, knowing what was coming, closed his eyes and lifted one arm-both hands on Splitter\u0027s pommel-to shield his sensitive eyes.\n There was a sizzle of electricity, the faint smell of ozone, and the none-too-faint stench of burned hair again. The furred creature growled in agony, and Ryld opened his eyes. Again, the arrowhawk was nowhere to be seen, likely whirling through the forest dodging tree trunks, circling back for another pass.\n \"Wait!\" a woman\u0027s voice called. Ryld thought at first that it was Halisstra. \"No, Feliane,\" Halisstra called back. \"It\u0027s all right. Between Ryld and the-\" \"No!\" the surface drow cut in.\n Ryld would have turned to watch Feliane approach, but the animal had decided to charge him again. Not sure what Feliane was trying to stop, exactly, Ryld stepped in toward the big animal. He saw the arrowhawk coming, though and slid to a stop in the snow. The animal must have realized why the drow came to such a sudden halt, and when the arrowhawk came in low for another slash with its talons, the creature saw it as well.\n Jaws snapped over the arrowhawk. There was a loud confusion of fluttering wings, screaming, growling, snapping, and popping-and the arrowhawk fell to the snow in two twitching, bleeding pieces.\n \"What\u0027s going on here?\" Feliane called, her voice much closer. \"What in the goddess\u0027s name are you doing?\"\n Its long, fang-lined jaws dripping with the arrowhawk\u0027s blood, the animal looked fiercer, more dangerous, and angrier than ever. Ryld smiled, spun his massive enchanted greatsword in front of him, and ran at the thing head on.\n Behind him and off in the underbrush, Halisstra and Feliane were talking in urgent tones, but Ryld\u0027s trained senses put that aside. They were allies, and the only opponent of note was the furious beast. Whatever they were discussing, they could tell him about it later, after he had dispatched the vicious, cunning predator.\n The creature reared up again as Ryld came in, and the drow slipped Splitter in low in front of him, slicing a deep furrow in the beast\u0027s exposed underbelly. Blood oozed from the wound, and quickly soaked the matted, dirty brown fur around it. Ryld spun his greatsword back around and pointed it forward, held in both hands above his head, for a final impaling stab.\n The forest predator again proved it wouldn\u0027t go down easily. Before Ryld could plunge Splitter home, the thing\u0027s huge, handlike claw wrapped around his right arm, digging into the space between his pauldron and vambrace to puncture the skin of his underarm.\n Ryld tucked his right arm down, pressing the claw against his armored side to keep the beast from tearing away his pauldron-and a good portion of skin and muscle with it. That had the unfortunate effect of tipping the point of his greatsword up. The animal pushed down, and its weight was enough to send Ryld sinking, slipping, then falling onto his back. Splitter\u0027s tip passed harmlessly past the animal\u0027s shoulder. When he felt the other claw clamp onto his left pauldron, Ryld knew he was pinned.\n The beast snapped at his face, but Ryld still had enough room to jerk his head out of the way. With all his considerable strength, the weapons master pushed up, but with his arms trapped over his head and his sword all but immobile next to the animal\u0027s ear, he had to use his back and shoulders to try to lift himself off the ground-carrying the fifteen-foot animal that must have weighed a ton at least with him. He didn\u0027t move it far, but when the animal felt him trying to push up, it pushed down, extending its arms the fraction of an inch Ryld needed to muscle his sword down and under. Twisting his wrists painfully, Ryld managed to get the greatsword\u0027s tip up under the beast\u0027s chin.\n The animal rolled, its dark, dull eyes down and stretched its neck up and away from the sword. The two of them were stuck that way, and Ryld feared that that was how they were going to remain for a very long time: it pushing him away, he trying to stab it through the throat.\n \"Halisstra!\" Feliane screamed. \"No!\"\n The sound was shrill, panicked, and close enough that it finally registered on Ryld that the two females were still there. He wasn\u0027t alone. As females were wont to do, they were letting him take the brunt of the punishment, but they wouldn\u0027t leave him like that-of would they? From the sound of Feliane\u0027s voice, it was exactly what she intended to do.\n Ryld redoubled his efforts, but so did the beast and they got no closer to a resolution-until Ryld heard a woman growl in an odd way, realizing it was Halisstra. The thing dipped that fraction of an inch forward that Ryld was hoping for.\n The tip of the greatsword bit into the animal\u0027s throat, and blood poured down the blade. The animal grunted, opening its mouth a quarter of an inch-and allowing the blade to slip that much farther in. Hot red blood exploded from the wound, then pumped out of the monstrosity\u0027s neck in rhythm to its speeding heart-Ryld had found the artery he\u0027d been hoping for.\n He saw Halisstra\u0027s boot to his right and heard a sword come out of its sheath. She had jumped onto the animal\u0027s back and was straddling it, drawing the Crescent Blade to deliver the killing blow.\n Ryld celebrated that realization by twisting Splitter\u0027s tip into the creature\u0027s throat, bringing more blood and sending a shiver rippling through the creature\u0027s fur.\n Feliane ran up next to them and must have hit the side of the animal hard. Halisstra grunted, and the hulk started to topple sideways. Ryld sawed into its neck for good measure, not sure it was actually dead.\n Feliane\u0027s boot scuffled in the snow next to him, and she said, \"Stop it. For Eilistraee\u0027s sake, that\u0027s not what the Crescent Blade was meant for.\"\n Ryld let the quivering carcass roll off him and fall into a dead sprawl in the underbrush. Wincing from the pain in his shoulder and underarm, he slid his blade out of the dead animal\u0027s neck and got to his feet, stepping back a few steps before he had his legs under him.\n Halisstra and Feliane were standing next to the fallen animal, and Feliane\u0027s hand was wrapped tightly around Halisstra\u0027s sword arm.\n \"I couldn\u0027t . . .\" Halisstra said, her voice quavering, each word punctuated by a puff of steam that rolled into the frigid air. \"I couldn\u0027t let it kill him.\" Both of the women turned to look at Ryld, who could only shrug.\n \"She was only protecting her young,\" Feliane said.\n She was looking at Ryld, but the weapons master got the distinct impression she was talking to Halisstra. Ryld didn\u0027t understand. Who was protecting . . . ? \"The animal?\" he asked.\n \"She\u0027s a giant land sloth,\" the Eilistraeen said, releasing Halisstra\u0027s arm and stepping away from her. \"She was a giant land sloth. They\u0027re rare, especially this far north.\"\n \"Good,\" Ryld said. \"It was tougher than it looks.\"\n \"Damn it!\" Feliane cursed. \"She was only protecting her young. You didn\u0027t have to kill her.\"\n Halisstra was looking at her sword, the blade glowing in the darkness.\n \"Why,\" Ryld asked, \"would it attack an armed drow to protect its young?
