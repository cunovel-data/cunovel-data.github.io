{"id":108238,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"As soon as Jacob and Bella got to Jacob\u0027s house, Bella called Charlie. She tried their home first, but he wasn\u0027t there, so she called the office. It was almost seven o\u0027clock, but it seemed that Charlie was still there. He seemed a little flustered when she called, he definitely wasn\u0027t used to having someone waiting for him... though in this case that was true, she wondered if he was always going to stay at the office late. He said that he was just going to eat at the office and asked that she was home before ten.\n \"So what\u0027s up?\" Jacob asked, finishing making enough spaghetti for three people; Billy was sitting in his chair watching TV.\n \"I don\u0027t have to be home until ten,\" Bella shrugged, and then whispered so only he could hear, \"that should be enough time to finish the manuscript.\"\n \"Yeah, it should be,\" Jacob said looking at his dad warily. \"Do you think I should tell my dad about this...?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know, Jake,\" Bella frowned, that was a good question. \"What do you think will happen if you do?\"\n \"I\u0027m not sure,\" Jacob frowned, too. \"But I\u0027m going to have to tell him something... at some point.\"\n \"Well, let\u0027s finish the book first, and then you could tell him whatever you think you should,\" Bella said.\n \"Sounds good to me,\" Jacob said, wanting to put off the lengthy conversation he knew he was going to have to have with his father for as long as possible. Dinner was a pleasant enough event. Billy seemed pleased that the two kids appeared to have become friends so quickly and it was clear that Bella was a lot more comfortable today than she had been yesterday. She didn\u0027t look quite as gloomy as she did when he had first seen her at least.\n After the meal was done, the two teens went back to Jacob\u0027s garage (Billy wondered what on Earth they were doing in there that was so interesting, but didn\u0027t ask out loud).\n \"I guess I\u0027ll read now,\" Bella said picking up the book and read, \"Interrogations.\"\n CNN broke the story first.\n \"What story?\" Jacob asked.\n Bella rolled her eyes. \"About the guy that...\"\n \"Oh,\" Jacob said and then glared at the book.\n I was glad it hit the news before I had to leave for school, anxious to hear how the humans would phrase the account, and what amount of attention it would garner.\n Luckily, it was a heavy news day. There was an earthquake in South America and a political kidnapping in the Middle East. So it ended up only earning a few seconds, a few sentences, and one grainy picture.\n \"It\u0027s a good thing that those terrible things happened,\" Jacob muttered darkly.\n \"I guess he just didn\u0027t want anyone in this town to notice that...\" Bella said.\n \"I guess he didn\u0027t want you to notice that,\" Jacob corrected and Bella had to admit he was right.\n \"Alonzo Calderas Wallace, suspected serial rapist and murderer wanted in the states of Texas and Oklahoma, was apprehended last night in Portland, Oregon thanks to an anonymous tip. Wallace was found unconscious in an alley early this morning, just a few yards from a police station. Officials are unable to tell us at this time whether he will be extradited to Houston or Oklahoma City to stand trial.\"\n The picture was unclear, a mug shot, and he\u0027d had a thick beard at the time of the photograph. Even if Bella saw it, she would probably not recognize him. I hoped she wouldn\u0027t; it would make her afraid needlessly.\n \"See,\" Jacob said triumphantly.\n \"I wasn\u0027t doubting you,\" Bella said, but she was looking at the book sadly.\n \"What\u0027s the matter?\" Jacob asked.\n \"I was just wondering if... that man... if someone got hurt... now, while we\u0027re reading this book,\" Bella said.\n \"I don\u0027t know what to do about that,\" Jacob said. \"I mean even if we do tell someone... it\u0027s not like we really know anything that would help catch him.\"\n \"I know,\" Bella frowned, even more down than she was before, but she picked up the book and started to read again.\n \"The coverage here in town will be light. It\u0027s too far away to be considered of local interest,\" Alice told me. \"It was a good call to have Carlisle take him out of state.\"\n I nodded. Bella didn\u0027t watch much TV regardless, and I\u0027d never seen her father watching anything besides sports channels.\n \"That\u0027s so true,\" Jacob said, laughing harder than was necessary in hope that Bella would loosen up some.\n I\u0027d done what I could. This monster no longer hunted, and I was not a murderer.\n Not recently, anyway. I\u0027d been right to trust Carlisle, as much as I still wished the monster had not gotten off quite so easily. I caught myself hoping he would be extradited to Texas, where the death penalty was so popular��\n \"You\u0027ll get no arguments here,\" Jacob stated.\n No. That didn\u0027t matter. I would put this behind me, and concentrate on what was most important.\n I\u0027d left Bella\u0027s room less than an hour ago. I was already aching to see her again.\n \"Alice, do you mind��\"\n She cut me off. \"Rosalie will drive. She\u0027ll act pissed, but you know she\u0027ll enjoy the excuse to show off her car.\" Alice trilled a laugh.\n Jacob rolled his eyes, though it was hard for him not to chuckle at that.\n I grinned at her. \"See you at school.\"\n Alice sighed, and my grin became a grimace.\n I know, I know, she thought. Not yet. I\u0027ll wait until you\u0027re ready for Bella to know me. You should know, though, this isn\u0027t just me being selfish. Bella\u0027s going to like me, too.\n \"Well of course I am,\" Bella said.\n \"I have to admit, she\u0027s not half bad,\" Jacob shrugged.\n I didn\u0027t answer her as I hurried out the door. That was a different way of viewing the situation. Would Bella want to know Alice? To have a vampire for a girlfriend?\n \"Yes,\" Bella answered.\n Knowing Bella��that idea probably wouldn\u0027t bother her in the slightest.\n Bella rolled her eyes; he just had to make it sound negative that she felt that way. Jacob, on the other hand, was laughing at her expression.\n I frowned to myself. What Bella wanted and what was best for Bella were two very separate things.\n \"No... what Bella wanted and what you think is best for Bella are two very separate things,\" Jacob said and Bella nodded her head in total agreement.\n I started to feel uneasy as I parked my car in Bella\u0027s driveway. The human adage said that things looked different in the morning��that things changed when you slept on them. Would I look different to Bella in the weak light of a foggy day? More sinister or less sinister than I had in the blackness of night? Had the truth sunk in while she slept?\n \"Er... she\u0027s known the truth for like four days or something... I\u0027m sure it\u0027s all sunk in,\" Jacob said.\n \"Yeah, but it was just confirmed today,\" Bella said.\n \"Do you think you\u0027ll be scared of him?\" Jacob questioned and Bella rolled her eyes. \"I rest my case.\"\n Would she finally be afraid?\n Her dreams had been peaceful, though, last night. When she\u0027d spoken my name, time and time again, she\u0027d smiled. More than once she\u0027d murmured a plea for me to stay.\n Would that mean nothing today?\n I waited nervously, listening to the sounds of her inside the house��the fast, stumbling footsteps on the stairs, the sharp rip of a foil wrapper, the contents of the refrigerator crashing against each other when the door slammed. It sounded like she was in a hurry. Anxious to get to school? The thought made me smile, hopeful again.\n I looked at the clock. I supposed that��taking in account the velocity her decrepit truck must limit her to��she was running a little late.\n \"You don\u0027t have to make fun of my truck,\" Bella muttered causing Jacob to laugh.\n Bella rushed out of the house, her book bag sliding off her shoulder, her hair coiled into a messy twist that was already coming apart on the nape of her neck. The thick green sweater she wore was not enough to keep her thin shoulders from hunching against the cold fog.\n The long sweater was too big for her, unflattering. It masked her slender figure, turning all her delicate curves and soft lines into a shapeless jumble. I appreciated this almost as much as I wished that she had worn something more like the soft blue blouse she\u0027d worn last night��the fabric had clung to her skin in such an appealing way, cut low enough to reveal the mesmerizing way her collar bones curled away from the hollow beneath her throat. The blue had flowed like water along the subtle shape of her body��\n Bella was blushing; did she always have to read the chapters where he described her like this?\n It was better��essential��that I kept my thoughts far, far away from that shape, so I was grateful to the unbecoming sweater she wore.\n \"Well, thanks,\" Bella groaned.\n I couldn\u0027t afford to make mistakes, and it would be a monumental mistake to dwell on the strange hungers that thoughts of her lips��her skin��her body��were shaking loose inside of me. Hungers that had evaded me for a hundred years. But I could not allow myself to think of touching her, because that was impossible.\n Bella was blushing again... thinking about him touching her.\n I would break her.\n Both Bella and Jacob grimaced at that.\n Bella turned away from the door, in such a hurry that she nearly ran right by my car without noticing it.\n Then she skidded to a stop, her knees locking like a startled colt\u0027s. Her bag slid further down her arm, and her eyes flew wide as they focused on the car.\n Jacob was laughing at this description... imaging it quite clearly in his head and Bella kept reading, blushing as she did so.\n I got out, taking no care to move at human speed, and opened the passenger door for her. I would not try to deceive her anymore��when we were alone, at least, I would be myself.\n Bella smiled at that... this was definitely what she wanted.\n She looked up at me, startled again as I seemingly materialized out of the fog.\n And then the surprise in her eyes changed to something else, and I was no longer afraid�� or hopeful��that her feelings for me had changed in the course of the night. Warmth, wonder, fascination, all swimming in the melted chocolate of her eyes.\n \"Do you want to ride with me today?\" I asked. Unlike dinner last night, I would let her choose. From now on, it must always be her choice.\n \"Good,\" Jacob said.\n \"Yes, thank you,\" she murmured, climbing into my car without hesitation.\n Would it ever cease to thrill me, that I was the one she was saying yes to? I doubted it.\n I flashed around the car, eager to join her. She showed no sign of being shocked by my sudden reappearance.\n The happiness I felt when she sat beside me this way had no precedent. As much as I enjoyed the love and companionship of my family, despite the various entertainments and distractions the world had to offer, I had never been happy like this. Even knowing that it was wrong, that this couldn\u0027t possibly end well, could not keep the smile from my face for long.\n My jacket was folded over the headrest of her seat. I saw her eyeing it.\n \"I brought the jacket for you,\" I told her. This was my excuse, had I needed to provide one, for showing up uninvited this morning. It was cold. She had no jacket.\n \"Lame excuse,\" Jacob said.\n \"He doesn\u0027t need an excuse,\" Bella shrugged.\n \"Doesn\u0027t make that any less lame,\" Jacob shrugged.\n Surely this was an acceptable form of chivalry. \"I didn\u0027t want you to get sick or something.\"\n \"I\u0027m not quite that delicate,\" she said, staring at my chest rather than my face, as if she were hesitant to meet my eyes.\n \"Or maybe she\u0027s just ogling you,\" Jacob said and laughed when Bella turned bright red.\n But she put the coat on before I had to resort to commanding or coaxing.\n \"Aren\u0027t you?\" I muttered to myself.\n She stared out at the road as I accelerated toward the school. I could only stand the silence for a few seconds. I had to know what her thoughts were this morning. So much had changed between us since the last time the sun was up.\n \"What, no twenty questions today?\" I asked, keeping it light again.\n She smiled, seeming glad that I\u0027d broached the subject. \"Do my questions bother you?\"\n \"Not as much as your reactions do,\" I told her honestly, smiling in response to her smile.\n \"There\u0027s nothing wrong with my reactions,\" Bella said.\n \"Except to this crazy vampire that doesn\u0027t want anything to make him too happy,\" Jacob said.\n Her mouth turned down. \"Do I react badly?\"\n \"No, that\u0027s the problem. You take everything so coolly��it\u0027s unnatural.\" Not one scream so far. How could that be? \"It makes me wonder what you\u0027re really thinking.\"\n Of course, everything she did or didn\u0027t do made me wonder that.\n \"Sorry,\" Bella shrugged, smiling.\n \"I always tell you what I\u0027m really thinking.\"\n \"You edit.\"\n Her teeth pressed into her lip again. She didn\u0027t seem to notice when she did this��it was an unconscious response to tension.\n \"Apparently,\" Jacob chuckled, noticing that Bella was doing that at the moment.\n \"Not very much.\"\n Just those words were enough to have my curiosity raging. What did she purposefully keep from me?\n Bella rolled her eyes... purposefully keep from him...\n \"Enough to drive me insane,\" I said.\n She hesitated, and then whispered, \"You don\u0027t want to hear it.\"\n I had to think for a moment, run through our entire conversation last night, word for word, before I made the connection. Perhaps it took so much concentration because I couldn\u0027t imagine anything that I wouldn\u0027t want her to say to me. And then��because the tone of her voice was the same as last night; there was suddenly pain there again��I remembered. Once, I had asked her not to speak her thoughts. Never say that, I\u0027d all but snarled at her. I had made her cry��\n Was this what she kept from me? The depth of her feelings about me? That my being a monster didn\u0027t matter to her, and that she thought it was too late for her to change her mind?\n Well, that was entirely possible, Bella thought to herself.\n I was unable to speak, because the joy and pain were too strong for words, the conflict between them too wild to allow for a coherent response. It was silent in the car except for the steady rhythms of her heart and lungs.\n \"Where\u0027s the rest of your family?\" she asked suddenly.\n \"Always worrying about everyone else,\" Jacob said.\n I took a deep breath��registering the scent in the car with true pain for the first time; I was getting used to this, I realized with satisfaction��and forced myself to be casual again.\n \"Well, that\u0027s really good to know,\" Jacob said.\n \"They took Rosalie\u0027s car.\" I parked in the open spot next to the car in question. I hid my smile as I watched her eyes widen. \"Ostentatious, isn\u0027t it?\"\n \"Um, wow. If she has that, why does she ride with you?\"\n Rosalie would have enjoyed Bella\u0027s reaction��if she were being objective about Bella, which probably wouldn\u0027t happen.\n \"Like I said, it\u0027s ostentatious. We try to blend in.\"\n \"You don\u0027t succeed,\" she told me, and then she laughed a carefree laugh.\n The blithe, wholly untroubled sound of her laughter warmed my hollow chest even as it made my head swim with doubt.\n \"Oh come on, man... just join in with the laugh and be happy,\" Jacob said.\n \"So why did Rosalie drive today if it\u0027s more conspicuous?\" she wondered.\n \"Hadn\u0027t you noticed? I\u0027m breaking all the rules now.\"\n My answer should have been mildly frightening��so, of course, Bella smiled at it.\n \"Of course,\" Jacob chuckled as Bella made a face.\n She didn\u0027t wait for me to open her door, just like last night. I had to feign normality here at school��so I couldn\u0027t move fast enough to prevent this��but she was just going to have to get used to being treated with more courtesy, and get used to it soon.\n \"I already said I would,\" Bella said.\n I walked as close to her as I dared, watching carefully for any sign that my proximity upset her. Twice her hand twitched toward me and then she would snatch it back. It looked like she wanted to touch me�� My breath sped.\n Jacob snickered at this. It was just funny to think of someone that was a hundred years old not even knowing how to handle almost holding hands.\n \"Why do you have cars like that at all? If you\u0027re looking for privacy?\" she asked as we walked.\n \"An indulgence,\" I admitted. \"We all like to drive fast.\"\n \"Figures,\" she mumbled, her tone sour.\n She didn\u0027t look up to see my answering grin.\n Nuh-uh! I don\u0027t believe this! How the hell did Bella pull this off? I don\u0027t get it! Why?\n \"Hmm... it seems like you might have been noticed,\" Jacob chuckled.\n \"You think?\" Bella groaned; she was sure she was going to be grilled by Jessica.\n Jessica\u0027s mental boggling interrupted my thoughts. She was waiting for Bella, taking refuge from the rain under the edge of the cafeteria\u0027s roof, with Bella\u0027s winter jacket over her arm. Her eyes were wide with disbelief.\n Bella noticed her, too, in the next moment. A faint pink touched her cheek when Bella registered Jessica\u0027s expression. The thoughts in Jessica\u0027s head were fairly clear on her face.\n \"Ah, now Jessica is trying to imitate your expression,\" Jacob chuckled.\n \"Hey, Jessica. Thanks for remembering,\" Bella greeted her. She reached out for the jacket and Jessica handed it to her wordlessly.\n I should be polite to Bella\u0027s friends, whether they were good friends or not.\n \"Good morning, Jessica.\"\n Whoa��\n \"Hm...\" Bella said, thinking that it might be better if Edward wasn\u0027t so nice to her friends.\n Jessica\u0027s eyes popped even wider. It was strange and amusing��and, honestly, a bit embarrassing��to realize how much being near Bella had softened me.\n \"Tough luck, man,\" Jacob chuckled and Bella grimaced at that... of course she liked that he was able to be close to her, but the side effect of having girls like him more... that really sucked.\n It seemed like no one was afraid of me anymore. If Emmett found out about this, he would be laughing for the next century.\n \"Hm... I\u0027ll be sure to tell him then,\" Jacob smiled.\n \"Er��hi,\" Jessica mumbled, and her eyes flashed to Bella\u0027s face, full of significance. \"I guess I\u0027ll see you in Trig.\"\n You are so going to spill. I\u0027m not taking no for an answer. Details. I have to have details! Edward freaking CULLEN! Life is so unfair.\n Bella\u0027s mouth twitched. \"Yeah, I\u0027ll see you then.\"\n Jessica\u0027s thoughts ran wild as she hurried to her first class, peeking back at us now and then.\n The whole story. I\u0027m not accepting anything less. Did they plan to meet up last night? Are they dating? How long? How could she keep this a secret? Why would she want to? It can\u0027t be a casual thing��she has to be seriously into him. Is there any other option? I will find out. I can\u0027t stand not knowing. I wonder if she\u0027s made out with him? Oh, swoon�� Jessica\u0027s thoughts were suddenly disjointed, and she let wordless fantasies swirl through her head.\n \"Did she actually think \u0027Oh, swoon\u0027,?\" Jacob asked laughing.\n \"Whatever,\" Bella shrugged; she was so not looking forward to this conversation with Jessica.\n I winced at her speculations, and not just because she\u0027d replaced Bella with herself in the mental pictures.\n It couldn\u0027t be like that. And yet I��I wanted��\n I resisted making the admission, even to myself. How many wrong ways would I want Bella in? Which one would end up killing her?\n \"How about you stop thinking about that one and give us all a break?\" Jacob hissed.\n I shook my head, and tried to lighten up.\n \"What are you going to tell her?\" I asked Bella.\n \"Hey!\" she whispered fiercely. \"I thought you couldn\u0027t read my mind!\"\n \"I can\u0027t.\" I stared at her, surprised, trying to make sense of her words. Ah��we must have been thinking the same thing at the same time. Hmm��I rather liked that.\n \"The simplest things pleases him,\" Jacob chuckled.\n \"Um... I\u0027m pretty sure this book proves that\u0027s not true,\" Bella said. \"He\u0027s never pleased about anything... or he never lets himself be pleased.\"\n \"However,\" I told her, \"I can read hers��she\u0027ll be waiting to ambush you in class.\"\n Bella groaned, and then let the jacket slide off her shoulders. I didn\u0027t realize that she was giving it back at first��I wouldn\u0027t have asked for it; I would rather she kept it��a token��so I was too slow to offer her my help. She handed me the jacket, and put her arms through her own, without looking up to see that my hands were extended to assist. I frowned at that, and then controlled my expression before she noticed it.\n \"He really is a gentleman,\" Bella muttered, she was really going to have to remember that and that it wasn\u0027t only car doors that he wanted to help her with.\n \"So, what are you going to tell her?\" I pressed.\n \"A little help? What does she want to know?\"\n I smiled, and shook my head. I wanted to hear what she was thinking without a prompt. \"That\u0027s not fair.\"\n Her eyes tightened. \"No, you not sharing what you know��now that\u0027s unfair.\"\n Right��she didn\u0027t like double standards.\n \"No... so tell me what you know,\" Bella said.\n We got to the door of her class��where I would have to leave her; I wondered idly if Ms. Cope would be more accommodating about a switch in the schedule of my English class�� I made myself focus. I could be fair.\n \"She wants to know if we\u0027re secretly dating,\" I said slowly. \"And she wants to know how you feel about me.\"\n Her eyes were wide��not startled, but ingenious now. They were open to me, readable. She was playing innocent.\n Jacob again laughed at this image.\n \"Yikes,\" she murmured. \"What should I say?\"\n \"Hmmm.\" She always tried to make me give away more than she did. I pondered how to respond.\n Bella rolled her eyes... that so wasn\u0027t true.\n A wayward strand of her hair, slightly damp from the fog, draped across her shoulder and curled around where her collar bone was hidden by the ridiculous sweater.\n It drew my eyes��pulled them across the other hidden lines��\n I reached for it carefully, not touching her skin��the morning was chill enough without my touch��and twisted it back into place in her untidy bun so that it wouldn\u0027t distract me again. I remembered when Mike Newton had touched her hair, and my jaw flexed at the memory. She had flinched away from him then. Her reaction now was nothing the same; instead, there was a slight widening of her eyes, a rush of blood under her skin, and a sudden, uneven thumping of her heart.\n Bella was again annoyed at having to read this out loud, and for the blush that came to her face... and that she had to wait another few days before meeting Edward... and worried about how that meeting would go...\n \"Um... are you going to read again any time soon?\" Jacob asked.\n \"Yeah... sorry,\" Bella blushed even more and then started reading.\n I tried to hide my smile as I answered her question.\n \"I suppose you could say yes to the first��if you don\u0027t mind��,\" her choice, always her choice, \"��it\u0027s easier than any other explanation.\"\n \"I don\u0027t mind,\" she whispered. Her heart had not found its normal rhythm yet.\n \"And as for her other question��\" I couldn\u0027t hide my smile now. \"Well, I\u0027ll be listening to hear the answer to that one myself.\"\n \"Argh,\" Bella said, now glaring at the book. \"That\u0027s not fair.\"\n \"But it does make this more entertaining,\" Jacob laughed.\n Let Bella consider that. I held back my laugh as shock crossed her face.\n I turned quickly, before she could ask for any more answers. I had a difficult time not giving her whatever she asked for. And I wanted to hear her thoughts, not mine.\n \"I\u0027ll see you at lunch,\" I called back to her over my shoulder, an excuse to check that she was still staring after me, wide-eyed. Her mouth was hanging open. I turned away again, and laughed.\n Jacob was laughing too. It was definitely better hearing the annoyance in Bella\u0027s voice as she read this.\n As I paced away, I was vaguely aware of the shocked and speculative thoughts that swirled around me��eyes bouncing back and forth between Bella\u0027s face and my retreating figure. I paid them little attention. I couldn\u0027t concentrate. It was hard enough to keep my feet moving at an acceptable speed as I crossed the soggy grass to my next class. I wanted to run��really run, so fast that I would disappear, so fast that it would feel like I was flying. Part of me was flying already.\n I put the jacket on when I got to class, letting her fragrance swim thick around me.\n I would burn now��let the scent desensitize me��and then it would be easier to ignore it later, when I was with her again at lunch��\n \"Hmm...\" Bella said, \"maybe I should wear his jacket more often then... if it would help him.\"\n It was a good thing that my teachers no longer bothered to call on me. Today might have been the day that they would have caught me out, unprepared and answerless.\n \"I wouldn\u0027t call that a good thing,\" Jacob pouted.\n My mind was in so many places this morning; only my body was in the classroom.\n Of course I was watching Bella. That was becoming natural��as automatic as breathing. I heard her conversation with a demoralized Mike Newton. She quickly directed the conversation to Jessica, and I grinned so wide that Rob Sawyer, who sat at the desk to my right, flinched visibly and slid deeper into his seat, away from me.\n Ugh. Creepy.\n Well, I hadn\u0027t lost it entirely.\n \"And you want to be creepy?\" Jacob said. \"This guy is weird.\"\n I was also monitoring Jessica loosely, watching her refine her questions for Bella.\n I could barely wait for fourth period, ten times as eager and anxious as the curious human girl who wanted fresh gossip.\n And I was also listening to Angela Weber.\n I had not forgotten the gratitude I felt to her��for thinking nothing but kind things toward Bella in the first place, and then for her help last night. So I waited through the morning, looking for something that she wanted. I assumed it would be an easy; like any other human, there must be some bauble or toy she wanted particularly. Several, probably. I would deliver something anonymously and call us even��\n \"Would it really be that easy to please someone?\" Bella asked, she couldn\u0027t really think of a \u0027thing\u0027 that would make her happy.\n \"Probably,\" Jacob said, thinking about the master cylinder that he needed for his car\n But Angela proved almost as unaccommodating as Bella with her thoughts. She was oddly content for a teenager. Happy. Perhaps this was the reason for her unusual kindness��she was one of those rare people who had what they wanted and wanted what they had. If she wasn\u0027t paying attention to her teachers and her notes, she was thinking of the twin little brothers she was taking to the beach this weekend��anticipating their excitement with an almost maternal pleasure. She cared for them often, but was not resentful of this fact�� It was very sweet.\n Bella smiled, she was definitely going to have to make friends with this girl.\n \"Well, it looks like you\u0027re not so unique after all,\" Jacob said. \"There are other humans out there that aren\u0027t selfish.\"\n \"I never thought I was unique,\" Bella shrugged.\n But not really helpful to me.\n There had to be something she wanted. I would just have to keep looking. But later. It was time for Bella\u0027s trig class with Jessica.\n Bella grimaced and the annoyance was back in her voice now.\n I wasn\u0027t watching where I was going as I made my way to English. Jessica was already in her seat, both her feet tapping impatiently against the floor as she waited for Bella to arrive.\n Conversely, once I settled into my assigned seat in the classroom, I became utterly still. I had to remind myself to fidget now and then. To keep up the charade. It was difficult, my thoughts were so focused on Jessica\u0027s. I hoped she would pay attention, really try to read Bella\u0027s face for me.\n Jessica\u0027s tapping intensified when Bella walked into the room.\n She looks��glum. Why? Maybe there\u0027s nothing going on with Edward Cullen.\n \"That\u0027s not it,\" Jacob said chuckling. \"I bet you\u0027re glum because you have to talk to her...\"\n \"And I know that Edward will be listening,\" Bella added, her voice was even more annoyed than it was before.\"\n That would be a disappointment. Except��then he\u0027s still available�� If he\u0027s suddenly interested in dating, I don\u0027t mind helping out with that��\n Bella had hissed the last words out and Jacob chuckled harder than ever.\n Bella\u0027s face didn\u0027t look glum, it looked reluctant. She was worried��she knew I would hear all of this. I smiled to myself.\n \"Tell me everything!\" Jess demanded while Bella was still removing her jacket to hang it on the back of her seat. She was moving with deliberation, unwilling.\n Ugh, she\u0027s so slow. Let\u0027s get to the juicy stuff!\n \"What do you want to know?\" Bella stalled as she took her seat.\n Jacob groaned and chuckled at this. \"You\u0027re not going to make this easy on her are you?\"\n \"No,\" Bella shook her head.\n \"What happened last night?\"\n \"He bought me dinner, and then he drove me home.\"\n The chuckling got louder now. \"You really are going to annoy her... and Edward, too, of course.\"\n And then? C\u0027mon, there has to be more than that! She\u0027s lying anyway, I know that. I\u0027m going to call her on it.\n \"How did you get home so fast?\"\n I watched Bella roll her eyes at the suspicious Jessica.\n \"He drives like a maniac. It was terrifying.\"\n This time both Jacob and Bella were chuckling.\n She smiled a tiny smile, and I laughed out loud, interrupting Mr. Mason\u0027s announcements. I tried to turn the laugh into a cough, but no one was fooled. Mr. Mason shot me an irritated look, but I didn\u0027t even bother to listen to the thought behind it. I was hearing Jessica.\n Huh. She sounds like she\u0027s telling the truth. Why is she making me pull this out of her, word by word? I would be bragging at the top of my lungs if it were me.\n \"That\u0027s not Bella\u0027s style,\" Jacob shrugged.\n \"Was it like a date��did you tell him to meet you there?\"\n Jessica watched surprise cross Bella\u0027s expression, and was disappointed at how genuine it seemed.\n \"Well there\u0027s one good thing about having an open face,\" Jacob said and laughed when Bella stuck her tongue out at him.\n \"No��I was very surprised to see him there,\" Bella told her.\n What is going on? \"But he picked you up for school today?\" There has to be more to the story.\n \"Yes��that was a surprise, too. He noticed I didn\u0027t have a jacket last night.\"\n That\u0027s not very much fun, Jessica thought, disappointed again.\n \"Ah... poor Jessie not getting anything fun out of you,\" Jacob laughed.\n I was tired of her line of questioning��I wanted to hear something I didn\u0027t already know. I hoped she wasn\u0027t so dissatisfied that she would skip the questions I was waiting for.\n \"So are you going out again?\" Jessica demanded.\n \"He offered to drive me to Seattle Saturday because he thinks my truck isn\u0027t up to it��does that count?\"\n Hmm. He sure is going out of his way to��well, take care of her, sort of. There must be something there on his side, if not on hers. How could THAT be? Bella\u0027s crazy.\n \"Why does everyone have to question my sanity in this book?\" Bella huffed.\n \"Because you\u0027re crazy!\" Jacob laughed.\n \"Yes,\" Jessica answered Bella\u0027s question.\n \"Well, then,\" Bella concluded. \"Yes.\"\n \"Wow��Edward Cullen.\" Whether she likes him or not, this is major.\n \"I know,\" Bella sighed.\n The tone of her voice encouraged Jessica.\n \"Damn,\" Bella said, she really wished she could have gotten out of this without revealing anything.\n Finally��she sounds like she gets it! She must realize��\n \"Wait!\" Jessica said, suddenly remembering her most vital question. \"Has he kissed you?\" Please say yes. And then describe every second!\n \"Do girls really care about that crap?\" Jacob rolled his eyes. \"Talking about kisses and stuff like that?\"\n \"I guess,\" Bella shrugged, she wasn\u0027t one to talk about something like that unless it was pulled out of her painfully like Jessica seemed to want to do.\n \"No,\" Bella mumbled, and then she looked down at her hands, her face falling.\n \"It\u0027s not like that.\"\n Damn. I wish�� Ha. Looks like she does too.\n Bella blushed again, and of course Edward was listening to that.\n I frowned. Bella did look upset about something, but it couldn\u0027t be disappointment like Jessica assumed. She couldn\u0027t want that. Not knowing what she knew. She couldn\u0027t want to be that close to my teeth. For all she knew, I had fangs.\n \"Um... this guy does realize that if you like someone you probably think about kissing them, right?\" Jacob said.\n Bella shrugged at that.\n I shuddered.\n \"Do you think Saturday��?\" Jessica prodded.\n Bella looked even more frustrated as she said, \"I really doubt it.\"\n Yeah, she does wish. That sucks for her.\n Was it because I was watching all this through the filter of Jessica\u0027s perceptions that it seemed like Jessica was right?\n Bella rolled her eyes.\n \"Slow as always, man,\" Jacob said.\n For a half-second I was distracted by the idea, the impossibility, of what it would be like to try to kiss her. My lips to her lips, cold stone to warm, yielding silk��\n And then she dies.\n Bella rolled her eyes and Jacob flinched at that.\n \"You really have to take that seriously, Bella,\" Jacob said. \"He\u0027s getting used to you... but it\u0027s got to be harder for him if he\u0027s close to you like that.\"\n \"I\u0027ll be careful,\" Bella said, but that didn\u0027t change her mind about wanting to be close to him like that.\n I shook my head, wincing, and made myself pay attention.\n \"What did you talk about?\" Did you talk to him, or did you make him drag every ounce of information out of you like this?\n \"A little of both,\" Jacob chuckled.\n I smiled ruefully. Jessica wasn\u0027t far off.\n \"I don\u0027t know, Jess, lots of stuff. We talked about the English essay a little.\"\n \"Um... you did?\" Jacob questioned.\n \"He mentioned it,\" Bella shrugged.\n A very little. I smiled wider.\n Oh, c\u0027MON. \"Please, Bella! Give me some details.\"\n Bella deliberated for a moment.\n \"Well��okay, I\u0027ve got one. You should have seen the waitress flirting with him�� it was over the top. But he didn\u0027t pay any attention to her at all.\"\n What a strange detail to share. I was surprised Bella had even noticed. It seemed a very inconsequential thing.\n \"Yeah, to you,\" Bella said. \"But having someone flaunt themselves in front of someone you like isn\u0027t fun at all... and something that anyone would notice.\"\n Interesting�� \"That\u0027s a good sign. Was she pretty?\"\n Hmm. Jessica thought more of it that I did. Must be a female thing.\n \"Or maybe it\u0027s a human thing,\" Jacob said, he thought it meant something, too. Of course he wouldn\u0027t have discussed this...\n \"Very,\" Bella told her. \"And probably nineteen or twenty.\"\n Jessica was momentarily distracted by a memory of Mike on her date Monday night��Mike being a little too friendly with a waitress who Jessica did not consider pretty at all.\n \"Hmph,\" Jacob huffed, his opinion of Mike, which was already low, just dropped there. He could have had at least the decency to not look at other girls when he was out on a date.\n She shoved the memory away and returned, stifling her irritation, to her quest for details.\n \"Even better. He must like you.\"\n \"I think so,\" Bella said slowly, and I was on the edge of my seat, my body rigidly still. \"But it\u0027s hard to tell. He\u0027s always so cryptic.\"\n Jacob snorted at that.\n \"What? It\u0027s true!\" Bella exclaimed.\n \"I know,\" Jacob said still laughing. \"It\u0027s just so funny because we know how he really feels.\"\n Bella give him a reluctant smile at that, even as she felt sorry for her book self for not knowing how Edward felt about her.\n I must not have been as transparently obvious and out of control as I\u0027d thought.\n Still��observant as she was�� How could she not realize that I was in love with her? I sifted through our conversation, almost surprised that I hadn\u0027t said the words out loud. It had felt like that knowledge had been the subtext of every word between us.\n \"Yeah and the other subtext was \u0027run away, Bella\u0027... or \u0027I\u0027m going to leave you, Bella,\u0027\" Bella said angrily; how was she supposed to know what he was thinking?\n Wow. How do you sit there across from a male model and make conversation?\n \"I don\u0027t know how you\u0027re brave enough to be alone with him,\" Jessica said.\n Shock flashed across Bella\u0027s face. \"Why?\"\n Weird reaction. What does she think I meant?\n \"That he\u0027s a dangerous monster that\u0027s trying to be good,\" Jacob said.\n \"Who is good,\" Bella corrected him.\n \"He\u0027s so��\" What\u0027s the right word? \"Intimidating. I wouldn\u0027t know what to say to him.\" I couldn\u0027t even speak English to him today, and all he said was good morning. I must have sounded like such an idiot.\n \"Yep,\" Jacob agreed.\n Bella smiled. \"I do have some trouble with incoherency when I\u0027m around him.\"\n She must be trying to make Jessica feel better. She was almost unnaturally self-possessed when we were together.\n Bella rolled her eyes; he so didn\u0027t see how much he affected her.\n \"Oh well,\" Jessica sighed. \"He is unbelievably gorgeous.\"\n Bella\u0027s face was suddenly colder. Her eyes flashed the same way they did when she resented some injustice. Jessica didn\u0027t process the change in her expression.\n \"Um... what does that expression mean?\" Jacob questioned.\n \"He\u0027s not just a pretty face,\" Bella said and then started reading.\n \"There\u0027s a lot more to him than that,\" Bella snapped.\n Oooh. Now we\u0027re getting somewhere. \"Really? Like what?\"\n Bella gnawed her lip for a moment. \"I can\u0027t explain it right,\" she finally said.\n \"But he\u0027s even more unbelievable behind the face.\" She looked away from Jessica, her eyes slightly unfocused as if she was staring at something very far away.\n The feeling I felt now was loosely similar to how it felt when Carlisle or Esme praised me beyond what I deserved. Similar, but more intense, more consuming.\n Bella frowned; she really was going to have to find out why he believed so strongly that he didn\u0027t deserve being praised.\n Sell stupid somewhere else��there\u0027s nothing better than that face! Unless it\u0027s his body. Swoon. \"Is that possible?\" Jessica giggled.\n Jacob chuckled at Jessica use of swoon again... it just was a weird thing to think.\n Bella didn\u0027t turn. She continued to stare into the distance, ignoring Jessica.\n A normal person would be gloating. Maybe if I keep the questions simple. Ha ha. Like I\u0027m talking to a kindergartener.\n Jacob narrowed his eyes at that... that sounded insulting to him.\n \"So you like him, then?\"\n I was rigid again.\n Bella didn\u0027t look at Jessica. \"Yes.\"\n \"I mean, do you really like him?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n Look at that blush!\n I was.\n Bella groaned.\n \"How much do you like him?\" Jessica demanded.\n The English room could have gone up in flames and I wouldn\u0027t have noticed.\n Bella\u0027s face was bright red now��I could almost feel the heat from the mental picture.\n \"Too much,\" she whispered. \"More than he likes me. But I don\u0027t see how I can help that.\"\n \"Do you really think you like him more?\" Jacob questioned.\n \"I think I like him more than he\u0027s showed me that he has likes me,\" Bella said, completely confusing Jacob. Bella sighed and then said, \"Obviously, I know that Edward loves me after hearing what he thought... but in the book... there is no way that I realize that. In the book, I must be convinced that... I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m thinking in the book actually.\"\n Shoot! What did Mr. Varner just ask? \"Um��which number, Mr. Varner?\"\n It was good that Jessica could no longer quiz Bella. I needed a minute.\n What on earth was that girl thinking now? More than he likes me? How did she come up with that? But I don\u0027t see how I can help that? What was that supposed to mean? I couldn\u0027t fit a rational explanation to the words. They were practically senseless.\n It seemed I couldn\u0027t take anything for granted. Obvious things, things that made perfect sense, somehow got twisted up and turned backwards in that bizarre brain of hers.\n Bella hissed as she read this. Was it her that twisted everything! He was the one who never seemed to be able to settle with one thought. Always having to think twenty different things at once.\n More than he likes me? Maybe I shouldn\u0027t rule out the institution just yet.\n I glared at the clock, gritting my teeth. How could mere minutes feel so impossibly long to an immortal? Where was my perspective?\n My jaw was tight throughout Mr. Varner\u0027s entire trigonometry lesson. I heard more of that than the lecture in my own class. Bella and Jessica didn\u0027t speak again, but Jessica peeked at Bella several times, and once her face was brilliant scarlet again for no apparent reason.\n Lunch couldn\u0027t come fast enough.\n I wasn\u0027t sure if Jessica would get some of the answers I was waiting for when the class was over, but Bella was quicker than she was.\n As soon as the bell sounded, Bella turned to Jessica.\n \"In English, Mike asked me if you said anything about Monday night,\" Bella said, a smile pulling at the corners of her lips. I understood this for what is was��offense as the best defense.\n \"Good one, Bells,\" Jacob chuckled.\n \"Yeah,\" Bella said smugly, though she was still upset that he kept thinking she was crazy.\n Mike asked about me? Joy made Jessica\u0027s mind suddenly unguarded, softer, without its usual snide edge. \"You\u0027re kidding! What did you say?\"\n \"I told him you said you had a lot of fun��and he looked pleased.\"\n \"Tell me exactly what he said, and your exact answer!\"\n That was all I was going to get from Jessica today, clearly. Bella was smiling like she was thinking the same thing. Like she\u0027d won the round.\n \"Well, obviously she did,\" Jacob chuckled.\n Well, lunch would be another story. I would have better success with getting answers out of her than Jessica, I would make sure of that.\n I could hardly bear to check in occasionally with Jessica through the fourth hour.\n I had no patience for her obsessive thoughts of Mike Newton. I\u0027d had more than enough of him in the last two weeks. He was lucky to be alive.\n I moved apathetically through gym class with Alice, the way we always moved when it came to physical activity with humans. She was my teammate, naturally. It was the first day of badminton.\n \"Badminton!\" Bella repeated in a whisper... she didn\u0027t like the sounds of having a racket in her hand.\n Of course, all this exclamation did was cause Jacob to chuckle at her reaction.\n I sighed with boredom, swinging the racket in slow motion to tap the birdie back to the other side. Lauren Mallory was on the other team; she missed.\n Alice was twirling her racket like a baton, staring at the ceiling.\n We all hated gym, Emmett especially. Throwing games was an affront to his personal philosophy. Gym seemed worse today than usual��I felt just as irritated as Emmett always did.\n Before my head could explode with impatience, Coach Clapp called the games and sent us out early. I was ridiculously grateful that he\u0027d skipped breakfast��a fresh attempt to diet��and the consequent hunger had him in a hurry to leave campus to find a greasy lunch somewhere. He promised himself he would start over tomorrow...\n \"Yeah, right... I believe him,\" Jacob rolled his eyes.\n This gave me enough time to get to the math building before Bella\u0027s class ended.\n Enjoy yourself, Alice thought as she headed off to meet Jasper. Just a few days more to be patient. I suppose you won\u0027t say hi to Bella for me, will you?\n I shook my head, exasperated. Were all psychics so smug?\n FYI, it\u0027s going to be sunny on both sides of the sound this weekend. You might want to rearrange your plans.\n \"He\u0027s not going to cancel, is he?\" Bella frowned, that would be devastating to her.\n I sighed as I continued in the opposite direction. Smug, but definitely useful.\n I leaned against the wall by the door, waiting. I was close enough that I could hear Jessica\u0027s voice through the bricks as well as her thoughts.\n \"You\u0027re not sitting with us today, are you?\" She looks all��lit up. I bet there\u0027s tons she didn\u0027t tell me.\n \"Oh, you have no idea,\" Jacob chuckled.\n \"I don\u0027t think so,\" Bella answered, oddly unsure.\n Hadn\u0027t I promised to spend lunch with her? What was she thinking?\n \"Sorry, you don\u0027t get to know that,\" Jacob laughed.\n They came out of the class together, and both girls\u0027 eyes widened when they saw me. But I could only hear Jessica.\n Nice. Wow. Oh, yeah, there\u0027s more going on here than she\u0027s telling me. Maybe I\u0027ll call her tonight�� Or maybe I shouldn\u0027t encourage her. Huh. I hope he moves past her in a hurry. Mike is cute but��wow.\n Again, Bella\u0027s voice turned a little angry and Jacob had to laugh at that.\n \"See you later, Bella.\"\n Bella walked toward me, pausing a step away, still unsure. Her skin was pink across her cheekbones.\n I knew her well enough now to be sure that there was no fear behind her hesitation. Apparently, this was about some gulf she imagined between her feelings and mine. More than he likes me. Absurd!\n \"You know, if he annoys you so much, you don\u0027t have to like him,\" Jacob said.\n \"It\u0027s too late for that, Jake,\" Bella said. \"And his thoughts can be annoying, but that doesn\u0027t make me like him any less.\"\n \"Hello,\" I said, my voice a tad curt.\n Her face got brighter. \"Hi.\"\n She didn\u0027t seem inclined to say anything else, so I led the way to the cafeteria and she walked silently beside me.\n The jacket had worked��her scent was not the blow it usually was. It was just an intensification of the pain I already felt. I could ignore it more easily than I once would have believed possible.\n Bella was restless as we waited in line, toying absently with the zipper on her jacket and shifting nervously from foot to foot. She glanced at me often, but whenever she met my gaze, she looked down as if she were embarrassed. Was this because so many people were staring at us? Maybe she could hear the loud whispers��the gossip was verbal as well as mental today.\n \"Argh,\" Bella groaned, she wasn\u0027t sure if she noticed the other people or not, but she didn\u0027t like hearing it now. Then her mind drifted as she thought about the attention she now knew she was going to get in soon on her first day of school.\n Or maybe she realized, from my expression, that she was in trouble. She didn\u0027t say anything until I was assembling her lunch. I didn\u0027t know what she liked��not yet��so I grabbed one of everything.\n \"What are you doing?\" she hissed in a low voice. \"You\u0027re not getting all that for me?\"\n \"Why are you complaining... it\u0027s free food,\" Jacob said, incredulously.\n Bella shrugged, she was sure he wouldn\u0027t understand her reason.\n I shook my head, and shoved the tray up to the register. \"Half is for me, of course.\"\n She raised one eyebrow skeptically, but said nothing more as I paid for the food and escorted her to the table we\u0027d sat at last week before her disastrous experience with blood typing. It seemed like much more than a few days. Everything was different now.\n She sat across from me again. I pushed the tray toward her.\n \"Take whatever you want,\" I encouraged.\n She picked up an apple and twisted it in her hands, a speculative look on her face.\n \"I\u0027m curious.\"\n What a surprise.\n \"Yes... it is rather shocking,\" Jacob chuckled and Bella rolled her eyes.\n \"What would you do if someone dared you to eat food?\" she continued in a low voice that wouldn\u0027t carry to human ears. Immortal ears were another matter, if those ears were paying attention. I probably should have mentioned something to them earlier��\n \"Oh great,\" Bella said, suddenly looking very self-conscious; she had a feeling the others weren\u0027t going to like this.\n \"You\u0027re always curious,\" I complained. Oh well. It wasn\u0027t like I hadn\u0027t had to eat before. It was part of the charade. An unpleasant part.\n I reached for the closest thing, and held her eyes while I bite off a small bite of whatever it was.\n \"I wasn\u0027t actually asking you to eat it,\" Bella rolled her eyes. \"A verbal answer would have been enough.\"\n Without looking, I couldn\u0027t tell. It was as slimy and chunky and repulsive as any other human food. I chewed swiftly and swallowed, trying to keep the grimace off my face. The gob of food moved slowly and uncomfortably down my throat.\n I sighed as I thought of how I would have to choke it back up later. Disgusting.\n \"That is disgusting... and something that we didn\u0027t need to hear about,\" Jacob said.\n Bella\u0027s expression was shocked. Impressed.\n I wanted to roll my eyes. Of course we would have perfected such deceptions.\n \"If someone dared you to eat dirt, you could, couldn\u0027t you?\"\n Her nose wrinkled and she smiled. \"I did once��on a dare. It wasn\u0027t so bad.\"\n Jacob laughed at that. \"Why?\"\n \"It was a dare,\" Bella said as if it was obviously, the all too common blush was coloring her checks again.\n I laughed. \"I suppose I\u0027m not surprised.\"\n They look cozy, don\u0027t they? Good body language. I\u0027ll give Bella my take later. He\u0027s leaning toward her just the way he should, if he\u0027s interested. He looks interested. He looks��perfect. Jessica sighed. Yum.\n I met Jessica\u0027s curious eyes, and she looked away nervously, giggling to the girl next to her.\n Hmmm. Probably better to stick to Mike. Reality, not fantasy��\n \"Yeah, you do that,\" Bella said.\n \"Jessica\u0027s analyzing everything I do,\" I informed Bella. \"She\u0027ll break it down for you later.\"\n I pushed the plate of food back towards her��pizza, I realized��wondering how best to begin. My former frustration flared as the words repeated in my head: More than he likes me. But I don\u0027t see how I can help that.\n She took a bite from the same slice of pizza. It amazed me how trusting she was.\n \"Why? Is there something wrong with the pizza?\" Bella wondered.\n \"I doubt it, he wouldn\u0027t give you anything that could have the slightest possibility of being dangerous,\" Jacob chuckled.\n Of course, she didn\u0027t know I was poisonous��not that sharing food would hurt her. Still, I expected her to treat me differently. As something other. She never did��at least, not in a negative way��\n I would start off gently.\n \"So the waitress was pretty, was she?\"\n She raised the eyebrow again. \"You really didn\u0027t notice?\"\n As if any woman could hope to capture my attention from Bella. Absurd, again.\n \"If you don\u0027t say things like that to me, how am I supposed to know that\u0027s what you\u0027re thinking?\" Bella muttered.\n \"No. I wasn\u0027t paying attention. I had a lot on my mind.\" Not the least of which had been the soft cling of her thin blouse��\n Good thing she\u0027d worn that ugly sweater today.\n \"Poor girl,\" Bella said, smiling.\n She liked that I hadn\u0027t found the waitress interesting in any way. I could understand that. How many times had I imagined crippling Mike Newton in the biology room?\n She couldn\u0027t honestly believe that her human feelings, the fruition of seventeen short mortal years, could be stronger than the immortal passions that had been building up in me for a century.\n Bella grimaced, when he said it like that it made sense and yet it hurt that he couldn\u0027t perceive how much she liked him.\n \"Something you said to Jessica��\" I couldn\u0027t keep my voice casual. \"Well, it bothers me.\"\n She was immediately on the defensive. \"I\u0027m not surprised you heard something you didn\u0027t like. You know what they say about eavesdroppers.\"\n Eavesdroppers never hear good of themselves, that was the saying.\n \"I warned you I would be listening,\" I reminded her.\n \"And I warned you that you didn\u0027t want to know everything I was thinking.\"\n Ah, she was thinking of when I\u0027d made her cry. Remorse made my voice thicker.\n \"You did. You aren\u0027t precisely right, though. I do want to know what you\u0027re thinking�� everything. I just wish��that you wouldn\u0027t be thinking some things.\"\n \"Um... he\u0027s being confusing again,\" Jacob said.\n More half-lies. I knew I shouldn\u0027t want her to care about me. But I did. Of course I did.\n \"That\u0027s quite a distinction,\" she grumbled, scowling at me.\n \"But that\u0027s not really the point at the moment.\"\n \"Then what is?\"\n She leaned toward me, her hand cupped lightly around her throat. It drew my eye��distracted me. How soft that skin must feel��\n Focus, I commanded myself.\n \"Do you truly believe that you care more for me than I do for you?\" I asked. The question sounded ridiculous to me, like the words were scrambled.\n Her eyes were wide, her breathing stopped. Then she looked away, blinking quickly. Her breath came in a low gasp.\n \"You\u0027re doing it again,\" she murmured.\n \"What?\"\n \"Dazzling me,\" she admitted, meeting my eyes warily.\n \"What did he do to dazzle you?\" Jacob asked and Bella shrugged... how could she know?\n \"Oh.\" Hmm. I wasn\u0027t quite sure what to do about that. Nor was I sure that I didn\u0027t want to dazzle her. I was still thrilled that I could. But it wasn\u0027t helping the progression of the conversation.\n \"It\u0027s not your fault.\" She sighed. \"You can\u0027t help it.\"\n \"Are you going to answer my question?\" I demanded.\n She stared at the table. \"Yes.\"\n That was all she said.\n \"Yes, you are going to answer, or yes, you really think that?\" I asked impatiently.\n More chuckling from Jacob and this time Bella joined him.\n \"Yes, I really think that,\" she said without looking up. There was a faint undertone of sadness in her voice. She blushed again, and her teeth moved unconsciously to worry her lip.\n Abruptly, I realized that this was very hard for her to admit, because she truly believed it. And I was no better than that coward, Mike, asking for her to confirm her feelings before I\u0027d confirmed my own. It didn\u0027t matter that I felt I\u0027d make my side abundantly clear. It hadn\u0027t gotten through to her, and so I had no excuse.\n \"You\u0027re so right, man, how could you be so hypocritical?\" Jacob stated. \"And I thought you were a gentleman.\"\n \"You\u0027re wrong,\" I promised. She must hear the tenderness in my voice.\n Bella looked up to me, her eyes opaque, giving nothing away. \"You can\u0027t know that,\" she whispered.\n She thought that I was underestimating her feelings because I couldn\u0027t hear her thoughts. But, in truth, the problem was that she was underestimating mine.\n \"Hmph,\" Bella said. Yes, she was underestimating his feelings, that was clear to her, but him thinking that he wasn\u0027t doing the same thing... he didn\u0027t know how much she cared about him. She didn\u0027t know how much her book self cared about him, but it had to be more than she did right now reading this book, and she knew that she already cared about him a lot.\n \"What makes you think so?\" I wondered.\n She stared back at me, the furrow between her brows, biting her lips. For the millionth time, I wished desperately that I could just hear her.\n I was about to beg her to tell me what thought she was struggling with, but she held up a finger to keep me from speaking.\n \"Let me think,\" she requested.\n As long as she was simply organizing her thoughts, I could be patient.\n \"I don\u0027t believe you,\" Jacob chuckled.\n Or I could pretend to be.\n And he laughed smugly at that.\n She pressed her hands together, twining and untwining her slender fingers. She was watching her hands as if they belonged to someone else while she spoke.\n \"Well, aside from the obvious,\" she murmured. \"Sometimes�� I can\u0027t be sure��I don\u0027t know how to read minds��but sometimes it seems like you\u0027re trying to say goodbye when you\u0027re saying something else.\" She didn\u0027t look up.\n \"No way... never does anything like that,\" Jacob said sarcastically.\n She\u0027d caught that, had she? Did she realize that it was only weakness and selfishness that kept me here? Did she think less of me for that?\n \"Perceptive,\" I breathed, and then watched in horror as pain twisted her expression. I hurried to contradict her assumption. \"That\u0027s exactly why you\u0027re wrong, though��\" I began, and then I paused, remembering the first words of her explanation.\n They bothered me, though I wasn\u0027t sure I understood exactly. \"What do you mean, \u0027the obvious\u0027?\"\n \"Well, look at me,\" she said.\n \"There is nothing wrong with the way you look,\" Jacob said to her, there was no joking in his voice as he said this.\n Bella blushed a little with the sincerity of his voice.\n I was looking. All I ever did was look at her. What did she mean?\n \"I\u0027m absolutely ordinary,\" she explained. \"Well, except for the bad things like all the near death experiences and being so clumsy that I\u0027m almost disabled. And look at you.\" She fanned the air toward me, like she was making some point so obvious it wasn\u0027t worth spelling out.\n She thought she was ordinary? She thought that I was somehow preferable to her? In whose estimation? Silly, narrow-minded, blind humans like Jessica or Ms. Cope? How could she not realize that she was the most beautiful��most exquisite��\n Bella blushed, but she knew that was too much to say... he was only thinking that because he liked her... still it wasn\u0027t so bad that he was thinking that.\n \"Looks aren\u0027t everything, Bells,\" Jacob said, \"and you have both looks and a good heart...\"\n \"Stop, Jake,\" Bella said, he was starting to make her feel uncomfortable.\n Those words weren\u0027t even enough.\n And she had no idea.\n \"You don\u0027t see yourself very clearly, you know,\" I told her. \"I\u0027ll admit you\u0027re dead-on about the bad things��\" I laughed humorlessly. I did not find the evil fate who haunted her comical. The clumsiness, however, was sort of funny. Endearing.\n Bella rolled her eyes; of course he would think that.\n Would she believe me if I told her she was beautiful, inside and out? Perhaps she would find corroboration more persuasive. \"But you didn\u0027t hear what every human male was thinking on your first day.\"\n Bella shivered, she didn\u0027t want to hear that either.\n Ah, the hope, the thrill, the eagerness of those thoughts. The speed with which they\u0027d turned to impossible fantasies. Impossible, because she wanted none of them.\n I was the one she said yes to.\n My smile must have been smug.\n Her face was blank with surprise. \"I don\u0027t believe it,\" she mumbled.\n \"Trust me just this once��you are the opposite of ordinary.\"\n Her existence alone was excuse enough to justify the creation of the entire world.\n She wasn\u0027t used to compliments, I could see that. Another thing she would just have to get used to. She flushed, and changed the subject.\n \"Well, that one is going to be more difficult,\" Bella mumbled.\n \"But I\u0027m not saying goodbye.\"\n \"Don\u0027t you see? That\u0027s what proves me right. I care the most, because if I can do it��\" Would I ever be unselfish enough to do the right thing? I shook my head in despair. I would have to find the strength. She deserved a life. Not what Alice had seen coming for her. \"If leaving is the right thing to do��\" And it had to be the right thing, didn\u0027t it? There was no reckless angel. Bella didn\u0027t belong with me. \"Then I\u0027ll hurt myself to keep from hurting you, to keep you safe.\"\n \"But it wouldn\u0027t stop from hurting me,\" Bella mumbled softly, almost painfully as she thought of that.\n As I said the words, I willed them to be true.\n She glared at me. Somehow, my words had angered her. \"And you don\u0027t think I would do the same?\" she demanded furiously.\n \"Would you?\" Jacob asked.\n Bella looked thoughtful for a moment; she was so lost in Edward\u0027s thoughts that it was hard to gather her own. \"Yes, if I knew it was better for him... I would have to, wouldn\u0027t I?\" she said, but she was shaking her head at the same time, she knew it couldn\u0027t be better for him if she left so it was ridiculous to even think of that.\n So furious��so soft and so fragile. How could she ever hurt anyone? \"You\u0027d never have to make the choice,\" I told her, depressed anew by the wide difference between us.\n She stared at me, concern replacing the anger in her eyes and bringing out the little pucker between them.\n There was something truly wrong with the order of the universe if someone so good and so breakable did not merit a guardian angel to keep her out of trouble.\n \"I have a guardian vampire and that\u0027s better,\" Bella said.\n \"Um... that doesn\u0027t sound better to me,\" Jacob shook his head and Bella just shrugged.\n Well, I thought with dark humor, at least she has a guardian vampire.\n I smiled. How I loved my excuse to stay. \"Of course, keeping you safe is beginning to feel like a full-time occupation that requires my constant presence.\"\n She smiled, too. \"No one has tried to do away with me today,\" she said lightly, and then her face turned speculative for half a second before her eyes went opaque again.\n \"Yet,\" I added dryly.\n \"Yet,\" she agreed to my surprise. I\u0027d expected her to deny any need for protection.\n How could he? That selfish jackass! How could he do this to us? Rosalie\u0027s piercing mental shriek broke through my concentration.\n Bella flinched as she read this... at the hostility in Rosalie\u0027s thoughts.\n \"Shut up, Blondie,\" Jacob hissed.\n \"Easy, Rose,\" I heard Emmett whisper from across the cafeteria. His arm was around her shoulders, holding her tight into his side��restraining her.\n Sorry, Edward, Alice thought guiltily. She could tell Bella knew too much from your conversation��and, well, it would have been worse if I hadn\u0027t told her the truth right away. Trust me on that.\n I winced at the mental picture that followed, at what would have happened if I\u0027d told Rosalie that Bella knew I was a vampire at home, where Rosalie didn\u0027t have a fa?ade to keep up. I\u0027d have to hide my Aston Martin somewhere out of state if she didn\u0027t calm down by the time school was over. The sight of my favorite car, mangled and burning, was upsetting��though I knew I\u0027d earned the retribution.\n \"Still... you don\u0027t have to take it out on the car,\" Jacob said horrified, and there was a longing look in his head that stated clearly that he wanted to see said car.\n Jasper was not much happier.\n Bella flinched again.\n I\u0027d deal with the others later. I only had so much time allotted to be to be with Bella, and I wasn\u0027t going to waste it. And hearing Alice had reminded me that I had some business to attend to.\n \"I have another question for you,\" I said, tuning out Rosalie\u0027s mental hysterics.\n \"Shoot,\" Bella said, smiling.\n \"Do you really need to go to Seattle this Saturday, or was that just an excuse to get out of saying no to all your admirers?\"\n She grimaced at me. \"You know, I haven\u0027t forgiven you for the Tyler thing yet. It\u0027s your fault that he\u0027s deluded himself into thinking I\u0027m going to prom with him.\"\n \"Oh, he would have found a chance to ask you without me��I just really wanted to watch your face.\"\n \"Jerk,\" Bella muttered.\n I laughed now, remembering her aghast expression. Nothing I\u0027d ever told her about my own dark story had ever made her look so horrified. The truth didn\u0027t frighten her. She wanted to be with me. Mind-boggling.\n \"If I\u0027d asked you, would you have turned me down?\"\n \"Probably not,\" she said. \"But I would have cancelled later��faked an illness or a sprained ankle.\"\n How strange. \"Why would you do that?\"\n Jacob chuckled and Bella rolled her eyes; the answer was so obvious.\n \"He calls you absurd for missing things but this guy is even worse,\" Jacob laughed.\n She shook her head, as if she was disappointed that I did not understand at once.\n \"You\u0027ve never seen me in gym, I guess, but I would have thought that you would understand.\"\n Ah. \"Are you referring to the fact that you can\u0027t walk across a flat, stable surface without finding something to trip over?\"\n \"Obviously.\"\n \"That wouldn\u0027t be a problem. It\u0027s all in the leading.\"\n For a brief fraction of a second, I was overwhelmed by the idea of holding her in my arms at a dance��where she would surely wear something pretty and delicate rather than this hideous sweater.\n Bella grimaced; she would have to get rid of that sweater.\n With perfect clarity, I remembered how her body had felt under mine after I\u0027d thrown her out of the way of the oncoming van. Stronger than the panic or the desperation or the chagrin, I could remember that sensation. She\u0027d been so warm and so soft, fitting easily into my own stone shape��\n I wrenched myself back from the memory.\n \"But you never told me��\" I said quickly, preventing her from arguing with me about her clumsiness, as she clearly intended to do. \"Are you resolved on going to Seattle, or do you mind if we do something different?\"\n \"As long as it\u0027s with you, anything is fine,\" Bella smiled.\n Devious��giving her a choice without giving her the option of getting away from me for the day. Hardly fair of me. But I had made her a promise last night��and I liked the idea of fulfilling it��almost as much as that idea terrified me.\n The sun would be shining Saturday. I could show her the real me, if I was brave enough to endure her horror and disgust. I knew just the place to take such a risk��\n Bella was really smiling now... she wanted to know more about what he looked like in the sun.\n \"I\u0027m open to alternatives,\" Bella said. \"But I do have a favor to ask.\"\n A qualified yes. What would she want from me?\n \"What?\"\n \"Can I drive?\"\n Was this her idea of humor?\n \"Nope,\" Jacob shook his head.\n \"Why?\"\n \"Well, mostly because when I told Charlie I was going to Seattle, he specifically asked if I was going alone and, at the time, I was. If he asked again, I probably wouldn\u0027t lie, but I don\u0027t think he will ask again, and leaving my truck at home would just bring up the subject unnecessarily. And also, because your driving frightens me.\"\n \"I knew that last bit would come up,\" Jacob chuckled.\n I rolled my eyes at her. \"Of all the things about me that could frighten you, you worry about my driving.\" Truly, her brain worked backwards. I shook my head, disgusted.\n Edward, Alice called urgently.\n Suddenly I was staring into a bright circle of sunlight, caught up in one of Alice\u0027s visions.\n It was a place I knew well, the place I\u0027d just considered taking Bella��a little meadow where no one ever went beside myself. A quiet, pretty place where I could count on being alone��far enough from any trail or human habitation that even my mind could have peace and quiet.\n Alice recognized it, too, because she had seen me there not so long ago in another vision��one of those flickering, indistinct visions that Alice had shown me the morning I\u0027d saved Bella from the van.\n \"No!\" Jacob said, knowing where this was going. \"You can\u0027t go there.\"\n \"It\u0027s not going to happen, Jake,\" Bella said, she too, knew where this was going.\n \"Bella...\" Jacob started to say.\n \"Let me just keep reading,\" Bella interrupted and stated reading again.\n In that flickering vision, I hadn\u0027t been alone. And now it was clear��Bella was with me there. So I was brave enough. She stared at me, rainbows dancing across her face, her eyes fathomless.\n It\u0027s the same place, Alice thought, her mind full of a horror that did not match the vision. Tension, perhaps, but horror? What did she mean, the same place?\n Both Jacob and Bella shivered, knowing what place Alice had to mean.\n And then I saw it.\n Edward! Alice protested shrilly. I love her, Edward!\n I shut her out viciously.\n She didn\u0027t love Bella the way I did. Her vision was impossible. Wrong. She was blinded somehow, seeing impossibilities.\n Not even a half a second had passed. Bella was looking curiously at my face, waiting for me to approve her request. Had she seen the flash of dread, or had it been too quick for her?\n I focused on her, on our unfinished conversation, pushing Alice and her flawed, lying visions far from my thoughts. They didn\u0027t deserve my attention.\n \"If it\u0027s not a flawed vision...\" Jacob started, gritting his teeth.\n \"It is,\" Bella said, her voice calm though she was a little afraid. \"Edward won\u0027t let it be.\"\n \"Does he even have a choice?\" Jacob hissed at her.\n \"He muddled up Alice\u0027s visions before,\" Bella said. \"When he stopped talking to me... he\u0027ll do it again.\"\n \"Right,\" Jacob said, not believing it, but hoping it was true.\n I wasn\u0027t able to keep up the playful tone of our banter, though.\n \"Won\u0027t you want to tell your father that you\u0027re spending the day with me?\" I asked, darkness seeping into my voice.\n I shoved at the visions again, trying to push them farther away, to keep them from flickering through my head.\n \"With Charlie, less is always more,\" Bella said, certain of this fact. \"Where are we going, anyway?\"\n \"You should tell him at least,\" Jacob said.\n Alice was wrong. Dead wrong. There was no chance of that. And it was just an old vision, invalid now. Things had changed.\n \"Right,\" Jacob said again, in his non-believing hopeful tone, and then added stiffly, \"but that doesn\u0027t mean you should take her to this meadow of yours.\"\n \"The weather will be nice,\" I told her slowly, fighting the panic and indecision.\n Alice was wrong. I would continue as if I hadn\u0027t heard or seen anything. \"So I\u0027ll be staying out of the public eye��and you can stay with me, if you\u0027d like to.\"\n Bella caught the significance at once; her eyes were bright and eager. \"And you\u0027ll show me what you meant, about the sun?\"\n Maybe, like so many times before, her reaction would be the opposite of what I expected. I smiled at that possibility, struggling to return to the lighter moment. \"Yes. But��\" She hadn\u0027t said yes. \"If you don\u0027t want to be��alone with me, I\u0027d still rather you didn\u0027t go to Seattle by yourself. I shudder to think of the trouble you could find in a city that size.\"\n Her lips pressed together; she was offended.\n The Bella who was reading the book wasn\u0027t offended by this... she was too busy worrying about what was going to happen next to be offended.\n \"Phoenix is three times bigger than Seattle��just in population. In physical size��\"\n \"But apparently your number wasn\u0027t up in Phoenix,\" I said, cutting off her justifications. \"So I\u0027d rather you stayed with me.\"\n She could stay forever and it would not be long enough.\n I shouldn\u0027t think that way. We didn\u0027t have forever. The passing seconds counted more than they ever had before; each second changed her while I remained untouched.\n Bella grimaced... that sounded so sad, the way that he described her changing every second...\n Jacob grimaced, it sounded liked Edward wanted her to be a vampire... or at least part of him wanted that so that she would always be by his side.\n \"As it happens, I don\u0027t mind being alone with you,\" she said.\n No��because her instincts were backwards.\n \"I know.\" I sighed. \"You should tell Charlie, though.\"\n \"Why in the world would I do that?\" she asked, sounding horrified.\n \"Because it\u0027s the right thing to do,\" Jacob said.\n \"So you always tell Billy where you go?\" Bella questioned.\n \"Um...\" Jacob said.\n \"That\u0027s what I thought,\" Bella said.\n \"I don\u0027t...\" Jacob started, but Bella had started reading again.\n I glared at her, the visions I couldn\u0027t quite manage to repress swirling sickeningly through my head.\n \"To give me some small incentive to bring you back,\" I hissed. She should give me that much��one witness to compel me to be cautious.\n Why had Alice forced this knowledge on me now?\n \"Oh,\" Bella said and then looked thoughtful. \"Maybe she did it so that you would be on guard... that you wouldn\u0027t be careless there.\"\n \"You think?\" Jacob asked.\n \"It\u0027s a possibility,\" Bella shrugged.\n Bella swallowed loudly, and stared at me for a long moment. What did she see?\n \"I think I\u0027ll take my chances,\" she said.\n Ugh! Did she get some thrill out of risking her life? Some shot of adrenaline she craved?\n \"I\u0027m not some kind of adrenaline junky,\" Bella rolled her eyes.\n I scowled at Alice, who met my glare with a warning glance. Beside her, Rosalie was glowering furiously, but I couldn\u0027t have cared less. Let her destroy the car. It was just a toy.\n \"Let\u0027s talk about something else,\" Bella suggested suddenly.\n I looked back at her, wondering how she could be so oblivious to what really mattered. Why wouldn\u0027t she see me for the monster I was?\n Because it\u0027s better to see you as the good man that you are, Bella thought to herself, not sure if Jacob would want to hear something like that, with the attitude he had right now.\n \"What do you want to talk about?\"\n Her eyes darted to the left and then the right, as if checking to make sure there were no eavesdroppers. She must be planning to introduce another myth-related topic.\n Her eyes froze for a second and her body stiffened, and then she looked back to me.\n \"Why did you go to that Goat Rocks place last weekend��to hunt? Charlie said it wasn\u0027t a good place to hike, because of bears.\"\n So oblivious. I stared at her, raising one eyebrow.\n \"How did you miss that one?\" Jacob tried to chuckle.\n \"Because it\u0027s bears... how could something that looks so human hunt bears?\" Bella said.\n \"Bears?\" she gasped.\n I smiled wryly, watching that sink in. Would this make her take me seriously?\n Would anything?\n She pulled her expression together. \"You know, bears are not in season,\" she said severely, narrowing her eyes.\n \"If you read carefully, the laws only cover hunting with weapons.\"\n She lost control over her face again for a moment. Her lips fell open.\n \"Bears?\" she said again, a tentative question this time rather than a gasp of shock.\n \"Grizzly is Emmett\u0027s favorite.\"\n I watched her eyes, seeing this settle in.\n \"Hmm,\" she murmured. She took a bite of the pizza, looking down. She chewed thoughtfully, and then took a drink.\n \"What are you thinking?\" Jacob asked.\n \"Don\u0027t know,\" Bella said.\n \"So,\" she said, finally looking up. \"What\u0027s your favorite?\"\n I supposed I should have expected something like that, but I hadn\u0027t. Bella was always interesting, at the very least.\n \"That was a great compliment,\" Jacob said and Bella rolled her eyes.\n \"Mountain lion,\" I answered brusquely.\n \"Really?\" Bella said, the idea of hunting a mountain lion seemed scary too... but she remembered how Emmett had hunted the bear... they couldn\u0027t be hurt by animals.\n \"Ah,\" she said in a neutral tone. Her heartbeat continued steady and even, as if we were discussing a favorite restaurant.\n Fine, then. If she wanted to act like this was nothing unusual��\n \"Of course, we have to be careful not to impact the environment with injudicious hunting,\" I told her, my voice detached and clinical. \"We try to focus on areas with an overpopulation of predators��ranging as far away as we need. There\u0027s always plenty of deer and elk here, and they\u0027ll do, but where\u0027s the fun in that?\"\n She listened with a politely interested expression, as if I were a teacher giving a lecture. I had to smile.\n \"Where indeed,\" she murmured calmly, taking another bite of pizza.\n \"Early spring is Emmett\u0027s favorite bear season,\" I said, continuing with the lecture. \"They\u0027re just coming out of hibernation, so they\u0027re more irritable.\"\n Seventy years later, and he still hadn\u0027t gotten over losing that first match.\n \"Yeah well, he basically died, didn\u0027t he? I wouldn\u0027t have gotten over that quickly either,\" Jacob said.\n \"Nothing more fun than an irritated grizzly bear,\" Bella agreed, nodding solemnly.\n Jacob snorted. \"You are so weird.\"\n I couldn\u0027t hold back a chuckle as I shook my head at her illogical calm. It had to be put on. \"Tell me what you\u0027re really thinking, please.\"\n \"I\u0027m trying to picture it��but I can\u0027t,\" she said, the crease appearing between her eyes. \"How to you hunt a bear without weapons?\"\n \"It\u0027s not difficult at all for them,\" Bella answered.\n \"Oh, we have weapons,\" I told her, and then flashed her a wide smile. I expected her to recoil, but she was very still, watching me. \"Just not the kind they consider when writing hunting laws. If you\u0027ve ever seen a bear attack on television, you should be able to visualize Emmett hunting.\"\n She glanced toward the table where the others sat, and shuddered.\n Finally. And then I laughed at myself, because I knew part of me was wishing she would stay oblivious.\n Her dark eyes were wide and deep as she stared at me now. \"Are you like a bear, too?\" she asked in an almost-whisper.\n \"More like the lion, or so they tell me,\" I told her, striving to sound detached again. \"Perhaps our preferences are indicative.\"\n \"That\u0027s an interesting theory,\" Bella said. \"I wonder how the others hunt and what their preferences are.\"\n Her lips pulled up a tiny bit at the corners. \"Perhaps,\" she repeated. And then her head leaned to the side, and curiosity was suddenly clear in her eyes. \"Is that something I might get to see?\"\n \"NO!\" Jacob said.\n \"Why... it\u0027s not that bad?\" Bella said.\n \"It would be very dangerous for you to be there,\" Jacob said. \"I mean beyond dangerous... don\u0027t you get it, you\u0027re his prey.\"\n \"Jacob...\" Bella started.\n \"I get that he doesn\u0027t want that to be the case, but that doesn\u0027t change the fact that you\u0027ve got to be a hell of a lot more appealing than any of those animals he would be hunting,\" Jacob said.\n \"Right,\" Bella gulped, that did sound dangerous.\n I didn\u0027t need pictures from Alice to illustrate this horror��my imagination was quite enough.\n \"Absolutely not,\" I snarled at her.\n She jerked away from me, her eyes bewildered and frightened.\n I leaned back, too, wanting to put space between us. She was never going to see, was she? She wouldn\u0027t do one thing to help me keep her alive.\n Jacob grimaced at Bella as she rolled her eyes at Edward\u0027s comment.\n \"Too scary for me?\" she asked, her voice even. Her heart, however, was still moving in double time.\n \"If that were it, I would take you out tonight,\" I retorted through my teeth. \"You need a healthy dose of fear. Nothing could be more beneficial for you.\"\n \"Then why?\" she demanded, undeterred.\n I glared at her blackly, waiting for her to be afraid. I was afraid. I could imagine only too clearly having Bella near when I hunted��\n Her eyes remained curious, impatient, nothing more. She waited for her answer, not giving in.\n But our hour was up.\n \"Later,\" I snapped, and I rose to my feet. \"We\u0027re going to be late.\"\n She looked around herself, disoriented, like she\u0027d forgotten we were at lunch.\n Like she\u0027d forgotten we were even at school��surprised that we were not alone in some private place. I understood that feeling exactly. It was hard to remember the rest of the world when I was with her.\n She got up quickly, bobbling once, and threw her bag over her shoulder.\n \"Later, then,\" she said, and I could see the determination in the set of her mouth she would hold me to that.\n \"Which means she\u0027s going to bring this up later,\" Jacob said.\n \"That\u0027s the end of the chapter,\" Bella said. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-twilight-saga-5-midnight-sun-twilight-2/page-11.html","bookId":2027,"book":{"id":2027,"title":"The Twilight Saga 5: Midnight Sun (Twilight #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Midnight Sun is an expected companion novel to the book Twilight by author Stephenie Meyer.
