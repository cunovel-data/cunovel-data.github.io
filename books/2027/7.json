{"id":108232,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"I had to wait when I got back to school. The final hour wasn\u0027t out yet. That was good, because I had things to think about and I needed the alone time.\n Her scent lingered in the car. I kept the windows up, letting it assault me, trying to get used to the feel of intentionally torching my throat.\n Attraction.\n It was a problematic thing to contemplate. So many sides to it, so many different meanings and levels. Not the same thing as love, but tied up in it inextricably.\n I had no idea if Bella was attracted to me. (Would her mental silence somehow continue to get more and more frustrating until I went mad? Or was there a limit that I would eventually reach?)\n I tried to compare her physical responses to others, like the secretary and Jessica Stanley, but the comparison was inconclusive. The same markers - changes in heart rate and breathing patterns - could just as easily mean fear or shock or anxiety as they did interest. It seemed unlikely that Bella could be entertaining the same kinds of thoughts that Jessica Stanley used to have. After all, Bella knew very well that there was something wrong with me, even if she didn\u0027t know what exactly it was. She had touched my icy skin, and then yanked her hand away from the chill.\n And yet...as I remembered those fantasies that used to repulse me, but remembered them with Bella in Jessica\u0027s place...\n I was breathing more quickly, the fire clawing up and down my throat.\n What if it had been Bella imagining me with my arms wrapped around her fragile body? Feeling me pull her tightly against my chest and then cupping my hand under her chin? Brushing the heavy curtain of her hair back from her blushing face? Tracing the shape of her full lips with my fingertips? Leaning my face closer to hers, where I could feel the heat of her breath on my mouth? Moving closer still...\n But then I flinched away from the daydream, knowing, as I had known when Jessica had imagined these things, what would happen if I got that close to her.\n Attraction was an impossible dilemma, because I was already too attracted to Bella in the worst way.\n Did I want Bella to be attracted to me, a woman to a man?\n That was the wrong question. The right question was should I want Bella to be attracted to me that way, and that answer was no. Because I was not a human man, and that wasn\u0027t fair to her.\n With every fiber of my being, I ached to be a normal man, so that I could hold her in my arms without risking her life. So that I could be free to spin my own fantasies, fantasies that didn\u0027t end in with her blood on my hands, her blood glowing in my eyes. My pursuit of her was indefensible. What kind of relationship could I offer her, when I couldn\u0027t risk touching her?\n I hung my head in my hands.\n It was all the more confusing because I had never felt so human in my whole life - not even when I was human, as far as I could recall. When I had been human, my thoughts had all been turned to a soldier\u0027s glory. The Great War had raged through most of my adolescence, and I\u0027d been only nine months away from my eighteenth birthday when the influenza had struck... I had just vague impressions of those human years, murky memories that faded more with every passing decade. I remembered my mother most clearly, and felt an ancient ache when I thought of her face. I recalled dimly how much she had hated the future I\u0027d raced eagerly toward, praying every night when she said grace at dinner that the \"horrid war\" would end... I had no memories of another kind of yearning. Besides my mother\u0027s love, there was no other love that had made me wish to stay...\n This was entirely new to me. I had no parallels to draw, no comparisons to make. The love I felt for Bella had come purely, but now the waters were muddied. I wanted very much to be able to touch her. Did she feel the same way?\n That didn\u0027t matter, I tried to convince myself.\n I stared at my white hands, hating their hardness, their coldness, their inhuman strength...\n I jumped when the passenger door opened.\n Ha. Caught you by surprise. There\u0027s a first, Emmett thought as he slid into the seat. \"I\u0027ll bet Mrs. Goff thinks you\u0027re on drugs, you\u0027ve been so erratic lately. Where were you today?\"\n \"I was...doing good deeds.\"\n Huh?\n I chuckled. \"Caring for the sick, that kind of thing.\"\n That confused him more, but then he inhaled and caught the scent in the car. \"Oh. The girl again?\"\n I grimaced.\n This is getting weird.\n \"Tell me about it,\" I mumbled.\n He inhaled again. \"Hmm, she does have a quite a flavor, doesn\u0027t she?\"\n The snarl broke through my lips before his words had even registered all the way, an automatic response.\n \"Easy, kid, I\u0027m just sayin.\u0027\"\n The others arrived then. Rosalie noticed the scent at once and glowered at me, still not over her irritation. I wondered what her problem was, but all I could hear from her were insults.\n I didn\u0027t like Jasper\u0027s reaction, either. Like Emmett, he noticed Bella\u0027s appeal. Not that the scent had, for either of them, a thousandth portion of the draw it had for me. I was still upset me that her blood was sweet to them. Jasper had poor control... Alice skipped to my side of the car and held her hand out for Bella\u0027s truck key. \"I only saw that I was,\" she said - obscurely, as was her habit. \"You\u0027ll have to tell me the whys.\"\n \"This doesn\u0027t mean - \"\n \"I know, I know. I\u0027ll wait. It won\u0027t be long.\"\n I sighed and gave her the key.\n I followed her to Bella\u0027s house. The rain was pounding down like a million tiny hammers, so loud that maybe Bella\u0027s human ears couldn\u0027t hear the thunder of the truck\u0027s engine. I watched her window, but she didn\u0027t come to look out. Maybe she wasn\u0027t there. There were no thoughts to hear.\n It made me sad that I couldn\u0027t hear enough even to check on her - to make sure she was happy, or safe, at the least.\n Alice climbed in the back and we sped home. The roads were empty, and so it only took a few minutes. We trooped into the house, and then went to our various pastimes.\n Emmett and Jasper were in the middle of an elaborate game of chess, utilizing eight joined boards - spread out along the glass back wall - and their own complicated set of rules. They wouldn\u0027t let me play; only Alice would play games with me anymore. Alice went to her computer just around the corner from them and I could hear her monitors sing to life. Alice was working on a fashion design project for Rosalie\u0027s wardrobe, but Rosalie did not join her today, to stand behind her and direct cut and color as Alice\u0027s hand traced over the touch sensitive screens (Carlisle and I had had to tweak that system a bit, given that most such screens responded to temperature). Instead, today Rosalie sprawled sullenly on the sofa and started flipping through twenty channels a second on the flat screen, never pausing. I could hear her trying to decide whether or not to go out to the garage and tune her BMW again.\n Esme was upstairs, humming over a new set of blue prints.\n Alice leaned her head around the wall after a moment and started mouthing Emmett\u0027s next moves - Emmett sat on the floor with his back to her - to Jasper, who kept his expression very smooth as he cut off Emmett\u0027s favorite knight.\n And I, for the first time in so long that I felt ashamed, went to sit at the exquisite grand piano stationed just off the entryway.\n I ran my hand gently up the scales, testing the pitch. The tuning was still perfect. Upstairs, Esme paused what she was doing and cocked her head to the side.\n I began the first line of the tune that had suggested itself to me in the car today, pleased that it sounded even better than I\u0027d imagined.\n Edward is playing again, Esme thought joyously, a smile breaking across her face. She got up from her desk, and flitted silently to the head of the stairs. I added a harmonizing line, letting the central melody weave through it.\n Esme sighed with contentment, sat down on the top step, and leaned her head against the banister. A new song. It\u0027s been so long. What a lovely tune.\n I let the melody lead in a new direction, following it with the bass line.\n Edward is composing again? Rosalie thought, and her teeth clenched together in fierce resentment.\n In that moment, she slipped, and I could read all her underlying outrage. I saw why she was in such a poor temper with me. Why killing Isabella Swan had not bothered her conscience at all.\n With Rosalie, it was always about vanity.\n The music came to an abrupt halt, and I laughed before I could help myself, a sharp bark of amusement that broke off quickly as I threw my hand over my mouth. Rosalie turned to glare at me, her eyes sparking with chagrined fury.\n Emmett and Jasper turned to stare, too, and I heard Esme\u0027s confusion. Esme was downstairs in a flash, pausing to glance between Rosalie and me.\n \"Don\u0027t stop, Edward,\" Esme encouraged after a strained moment.\n I started playing again, turning my back on Rosalie while trying very hard to control the grin stretching across my face. She got to her feet and stalked out of the room, more angry than embarrassed. But certainly quite embarrassed.\n If you say anything I will hunt you like a dog.\n I smothered another laugh.\n \"What\u0027s wrong, Rose?\" Emmett called after her. Rosalie didn\u0027t turn. She continued, back ramrod straight, to the garage and then squirmed under her car as if she could bury herself there.\n \"What\u0027s that about?\" Emmett asked me.\n \"I don\u0027t have the faintest idea,\" I lied.\n Emmett grumbled, frustrated.\n \"Keep playing,\" Esme urged. My hands had paused again.\n I did as she asked, and she came to stand behind me, putting her hands on my shoulders.\n The song was compelling, but incomplete. I toyed with a bridge, but it didn\u0027t seem right somehow.\n \"It\u0027s charming. Does it have a name?\" Esme asked.\n \"Not yet.\"\n \"Is there a story to it?\" she asked, a smile in her voice. This gave her very great pleasure, and I felt guilty for having neglected my music for so long. It had been selfish. \"It\u0027s...a lullaby, I suppose.\" I got the bridge right then. It led easily to the next movement, taking on a life of its own.\n \"A lullaby,\" she repeated to herself.\n There was a story to this melody, and once I saw that, the pieces fell into place effortlessly. The story was a sleeping girl in a narrow bed, dark hair thick and wild and twisted like seaweed across the pillow...\n Alice left Jasper to his own devices and came to sit next to me on the bench. In her trilling, wind chime voice, she sketched out a wordless descant two octaves above the melody.\n \"I like it,\" I murmured. \"But how about this?\"\n I added her line to the harmony - my hands were flying across the keys now to work all the pieces together - modifying it a bit, taking it in a new direction... She caught the mood, and sung along.\n \"Yes. Perfect,\" I said.\n Esme squeezed my shoulder.\n But I could see the end now, with Alice\u0027s voice rising above the tune and taking it to another place. I could see how the song must end, because the sleeping girl was perfect just the way she was, and any change at all would be wrong, a sadness. The song drifted toward that realization, slower and lower now. Alice\u0027s voice lowered, too, and became solemn, a tone that belonged under the echoing arches of a candlelit cathedral. I played the last note, and then bowed my head over the keys.\n Esme stroked my hair. It\u0027s going to be fine, Edward. This is going to work out for the best. You deserve happiness, my son. Fate owes you that.\n \"Thanks,\" I whispered, wishing I could believe it.\n Love doesn\u0027t always come in convenient packages.\n I laughed once without humor.\n You, out of everyone on this planet, are perhaps best equipped to deal with such a difficult quandary. You are the best and the brightest of us all.\n I sighed. Every mother thought the same of her son.\n Esme was still full of joy that my heart had finally been touched after all this time, no matter the potential for tragedy. She\u0027d thought I would always be alone...\n She\u0027ll have to love you back, she thought suddenly, catching me by surprise with the direction of her thoughts. If she\u0027s a bright girl. She smiled. But I can\u0027t imagine anyone being so slow they wouldn\u0027t see the catch you are.\n \"Stop it, Mom, you\u0027re making me blush,\" I teased. Her words, though improbable, did cheer me.\n Alice laughed and picked out the top hand of \"Heart and Soul.\" I grinned and completed the simple harmony with her. Then I favored her with a performance of \"Chopsticks.\"\n She giggled, then sighed. \"So I wish you\u0027d tell me what you were laughing at Rose about,\" Alice said. \"But I can see that you won\u0027t.\"\n \"Nope.\"\n She flicked my ear with her finger.\n \"Be nice, Alice,\" Esme chided. \"Edward is being a gentleman.\"\n \"But I want to know.\"\n I laughed at the whining tone she put on. Then I said, \"Here, Esme,\" and began playing her favorite song, an unnamed tribute to the love I\u0027d watched between her and Carlisle for so many years.\n \"Thank you, dear.\" She squeezed my shoulder again.\n I didn\u0027t have to concentrate to play the familiar piece. Instead I thought of Rosalie, still figuratively writhing in mortification in the garage, and I grinned to myself. Having just discovered the potency of jealousy for myself, I had a small amount of pity for her. It was a wretched way to feel. Of course, her jealously was a thousand times more petty than mine. Quite the fox in the manger scenario.\n I wondered how Rosalie\u0027s life and personality would have been different if she had not always been the most beautiful. Would she have been a happier person if beauty hadn\u0027t at all times been her strongest selling point? Less egocentric? More compassionate? Well, I supposed it was useless to wonder, because the past was done, and she always had been the most beautiful. Even when human, she had ever lived in the spotlight of her own loveliness. Not that she\u0027d minded. The opposite - she\u0027d loved admiration above almost anything else. That hadn\u0027t changed with the loss of her mortality.\n It was no surprise then, taking this need as a given, that she\u0027d been offended when I had not, from the beginning, worshiped her beauty the way she expected all males to worship. Not that she\u0027d wanted me in any way - far from it. But it had aggravated her that I did not want her, despite that. She was used to being wanted.\n It was different with Jasper and Carlisle - they were already both in love. I was completely unattached, and yet still remained obstinately unmoved.\n I\u0027d thought that old resentment was buried. That she was long passed it.\n And she had been...until the day that I finally found someone whose beauty touched me the way hers had not.\n Rosalie had relied on the belief that if I did not find her beauty worth worshiping, then certainly there was no beauty on earth that would reach me. She\u0027d been furious since the moment I\u0027d saved Bella\u0027s life, guessing, with her shrewd female intuition, the interest that I was all but unconscious of myself.\n Rosalie was mortally offended that I found some insignificant human girl more appealing than her.\n I suppressed the urge to laugh again.\n It bothered me some, though, the way she saw Bella. Rosalie actually thought the girl was plain. How could she believe that? It seemed incomprehensible to me. A product of the jealousy, no doubt.\n \"Oh!\" Alice said abruptly. \"Jasper, guess what?\"\n I saw what she\u0027d just seen, and my hands froze on the keys.\n \"What, Alice?\" Jasper asked.\n \"Peter and Charlotte are coming to visit next week! They\u0027re going to be in the neighborhood, isn\u0027t that nice?\"\n \"What\u0027s wrong, Edward?\" Esme asked, feeling the tension in my shoulders.\n \"Peter and Charlotte are coming to Forks?\" I hissed at Alice She rolled her eyes at me. \"Calm down, Edward. It\u0027s not their first visit.\"\n My teeth clenched together. It was their first visit since Bella had arrived, and her sweet blood didn\u0027t appeal just to me.\n Alice frowned at my expression. \"They never hunt here. You know that.\"\n But Jasper\u0027s brother of sorts and the little vampire he loved were not like us; they hunted the usual way. They could not be trusted around Bella.\n \"When?\" I demanded.\n She pursed her lips unhappily, but told me what I needed to know. Monday morning. No one is going to hurt Bella.\n \"No,\" I agreed, and then turned away from her. \"You ready, Emmett?\"\n \"I thought we were leaving in the morning?\"\n \"We\u0027re coming back by midnight Sunday. I guess it\u0027s up to you when you want\n to leave.\"\n \"Okay, fine. Let me say goodbye to Rose first.\"\n \"Sure.\" With the mood Rosalie was in, it would be a short goodbye.\n You really have lost it, Edward, he thought as he headed toward the back door.\n \"I suppose I have.\"\n \"Play the new song for me, one more time,\" Esme asked.\n \"If you\u0027d like that,\" I agreed, though I was a little hesitant to follow the tune to its unavoidable end - the end that had set me aching in unfamiliar ways. I thought for a moment, and then pulled the bottle cap from my pocket and set it on the empty music stand. That helped a bit - my little memento of her yes.\n I nodded to myself, and started playing.\n Esme and Alice exchanged a glance, but neither one asked.\n \"Hasn\u0027t anyone ever told you not to play with your food?\" I called to Emmett.\n \"Oh, hey Edward!\" he shouted back, grinning and waving at me. The bear took advantage of his distraction to rake its heavy paw across Emmett\u0027s chest. The sharp claws shredded through his shirt, and squealed across his skin.\n The bear bellowed at the high-pitched noise.\n Aw hell, Rose gave me this shirt!\n Emmett roared back at the enraged animal.\n I sighed and sat down on a convenient boulder. This might take awhile.\n But Emmett was almost done. He let the bear try to take his head off with another swipe of the paw, laughing as the blow bounced off and sent the bear staggering back. The bear roared and Emmett roared again through his laughter. Then he launched himself at the animal, who stood a head taller than him on its hind legs, and their bodies fell to the ground tangled up together, taking a mature spruce tree down with them. The bear\u0027s growls cut off with a gurgle.\n A few minutes later, Emmett jogged over to where I was waiting for him. His shirt was destroyed, torn and bloodied, sticky with sap and covered in fur. His dark curly hair wasn\u0027t in much better shape. He had a huge grin on his face.\n \"That was a strong one. I could almost feel it when he clawed me.\"\n \"You\u0027re such a child, Emmett.\"\n He eyed my smooth, clean white button-down. \"Weren\u0027t you able to track down that mountain lion, then?\"\n \"Of course I was. I just don\u0027t eat like a savage.\"\n Emmett laughed his booming laugh. \"I wish they were stronger. It would be more fun.\"\n \"No one said you had to fight your food.\"\n \"Yeah, but who else am I going to fight with? You and Alice cheat, Rose never wants to get her hair messed up, and Esme gets mad if Jasper and I really go at it.\" \"Life is hard all around, isn\u0027t it?\"\n Emmett grinned at me, shifting his weight a bit so that he was suddenly poised to take a charge.\n \"C\u0027mon Edward. Just turn it off for one minute and fight fair.\"\n \"It doesn\u0027t turn off,\" I reminded him.\n \"Wonder what that human girl does to keep you out?\" Emmett mused. \"Maybe she could give me some pointers.\"\n My good humor vanished. \"Stay away from her,\" I growled through my teeth. \"Touchy, touchy.\"\n I sighed. Emmett came to sit beside me on the rock.\n \"Sorry. I know you\u0027re going through a tough spot. I really am trying to not be too much of an insensitive jerk, but, since that\u0027s sort of my natural state...\" He waited for me to laugh at his joke, and then made a face.\n So serious all the time. What\u0027s bugging you now?\n \"Thinking about her. Well, worrying, really.\"\n \"What\u0027s there to worry about? You are here.\" He laughed loudly.\n I ignored his joke again, but answered his question. \"Have you ever thought about how fragile they all are? How many bad things there are that can happen to a mortal?\"\n \"Not really. I guess I see what you mean, though. I wasn\u0027t much match for a bear that first time around, was I?\"\n \"Bears,\" I muttered, adding a new fear to the pile. \"That would be just her luck, wouldn\u0027t it? Stray bear in town. Of course it would head straight for Bella.\"\n Emmett chuckled. \"You sound like a crazy person, do you know that?\" \"Just imagine for one minute that Rosalie was human, Emmett. And she could run into a bear...or get hit by a car...or lightening...or fall down stairs...or get sick - get a disease!\" The words burst from me stormily. It was a relief to let them out - they\u0027d been festering inside me all weekend. \"Fires and earthquakes and tornados! Ugh!\n When\u0027s the last time you watched the news? Have you seen the kinds of things that happen to them? Burglaries and homicides...\" My teeth clenched together, and I was abruptly so infuriated by the idea of another human hurting her that I couldn\u0027t breathe. \"Whoa, whoa! Hold up, there, kid. She lives in Forks, remember? So she gets rained on.\" He shrugged.\n \"I think she has some serious bad luck, Emmett, I really do. Look at the evidence. Of all the places in the world she could go, she ends up in a town where vampires make up a significant portion of the population.\"\n \"Yeah, but we\u0027re vegetarians. So isn\u0027t that good luck, not bad?\"\n \"With the way she smells? Definitely bad. And then, more bad luck, the way she smells to me.\" I glowered at my hands, hating them again.\n \"Except that you have more self-control than just about anyone but Carlisle. Good luck again.\"\n \"The van?\"\n \"That was just an accident.\"\n \"You should have seen it coming for her, Em, again and again. I swear, it was like she had some kind of magnetic pull.\"\n \"But you were there. That was good luck.\"\n \"Was it? Isn\u0027t this the worst luck any human could ever possibly have - to have a vampire fall in love with them?\"\n Emmett considered that quietly for a moment. He pictured the girl in his head, and found the image uninteresting. Honestly, I can\u0027t really see the draw.\n \"Well, I can\u0027t really see Rosalie\u0027s allure, either,\" I said rudely. \"Honestly, she seems like more work than any pretty face is worth.\"\n Emmett chuckled. \"I don\u0027t suppose you\u0027d tell me...\"\n \"I don\u0027t know what her problem is, Emmett,\" I lied with a sudden, wide grin. I saw his intent in time to brace myself. He tried to shove me off the rock, and there was a loud cracking sound as a fissure opened in the stone between us. \"Cheater,\" he muttered.\n I waited for him to try another time, but his thoughts took a different direction. He was picturing Bella\u0027s face again, but imagining it whiter, imagining her eyes bright red...\n \"No,\" I said, my voice strangled.\n \"It solves your worries about mortality, doesn\u0027t it? And then you wouldn\u0027t want to kill her, either. Isn\u0027t that the best way?\"\n \"For me? Or for her?\"\n \"For you,\" he answered easily. His tone added the of course.\n I laughed humorlessly. \"Wrong answer.\"\n \"I didn\u0027t mind so much,\" he reminded me.\n \"Rosalie did.\"\n He sighed. We both knew that Rosalie would do anything, give up anything, if it meant she could be human again. Even Emmett.\n \"Yeah, Rose did,\" he acquiesced quietly.\n \"I can\u0027t... I shouldn\u0027t... I\u0027m not going to ruin Bella\u0027s life. Wouldn\u0027t you feel the same, if it were Rosalie?\"\n Emmett thought about that for a moment. You really...love her?\n \"I can\u0027t even describe it, Emmett. All of a sudden, this girl\u0027s the whole world to me. I don\u0027t see the point of the rest of the world without her anymore.\"\n But you won\u0027t change her? She won\u0027t last forever, Edward.\n \"I know that,\" I groaned.\n And, as you\u0027ve pointed out, she\u0027s sort of breakable.\n \"Trust me - that I know, too.\"\n Emmett was not a tactful person, and delicate discussions were not his forte. He struggled now, wanting very much not to be offensive.\n Can you even touch her? I mean, if you love her...wouldn\u0027t you want to, well touch her...?\n Emmett and Rosalie shared an intensely physical love. He had a hard time understanding how one could love, without that aspect.\n I sighed. \"I can\u0027t even think of that, Emmett.\"\n Wow. So what are your options, then?\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" I whispered. \"I\u0027m trying to figure out a way to...to leave her. I just can\u0027t fathom how to make myself stay away...\"\n With a deep sense of gratification, I suddenly realized that it was right for me to stay - at least for now, with Peter and Charlotte on their way. She was safer with me here, temporarily, than she would be if I were gone. For the moment, I could be her unlikely protector.\n The thought made me anxious; I itched to be back so that I could fill that role for as long as possible.\n Emmett noticed the change in my expression. What are you thinking about?\n \"Right now,\" I admitted a bit sheepishly, \"I\u0027m dying to run back to Forks and check on her. I don\u0027t know if I\u0027ll make it till Sunday night.\"\n \"Uh-uh! You are not going home early. Let Rosalie cool down a little bit.\n Please! For my sake.\"\n \"I\u0027ll try to stay,\" I said doubtfully.\n Emmett tapped the phone in my pocket. \"Alice would call if there were any basis for your panic attack. She\u0027s as weird about this girl as you are.\"\n I grimaced at that. \"Fine. But I\u0027m not staying past Sunday.\"\n \"There\u0027s no point in hurrying back - it\u0027s going to be sunny, anyway. Alice said we were free from school until Wednesday.\"\n I shook my head rigidly.\n \"Peter and Charlotte know how to behave themselves.\"\n \"I really don\u0027t care, Emmett. With Bella\u0027s luck, she\u0027ll go wandering off into the woods at exactly the wrong moment and - \" I flinched. \"Peter isn\u0027t known for his selfcontrol. I\u0027m going back Sunday.\"\n Emmett sighed. Exactly like a crazy person.\n Bella was sleeping peacefully when I climbed up to her bedroom window early Monday morning. I\u0027d remembered oil this time, and the window now moved silently out of my way.\n I could tell by the way her hair lay smooth across the pillow that she\u0027d had a less restless night than the last time I was here. She had her hands folded under her cheek like a small child, and her mouth was slightly open. I could hear her breath moving slowly in and out between her lips.\n It was an amazing relief to be here, to be able to see her again. I realized that I wasn\u0027t truly at ease unless that was the case. Nothing was right when I was away from her.\n Not that all was right when I was with her, either, though. I sighed, letting the thirst fire rake through my throat. I\u0027d been away from it too long. The time spent without pain and temptation made it all the more forceful now. It was bad enough that I was afraid to go kneel beside her bed so that I could read the titles of her books. I wanted to know the stories in her head, but I was afraid of more than my thirst, afraid that if I let myself get that close to her, I would want to be closer still...\n Her lips looked very soft and warm. I could imagine touching them with the tip of my finger. Just lightly...\n That was exactly the kind of mistake that I had to avoid.\n My eyes ran over her face again and again, examining it for changes. Mortals changed all the time - I was sad at the thought of missing anything...\n I thought she looked...tired. Like she hadn\u0027t gotten enough sleep this weekend.\n Had she gone out?\n I laughed silently and wryly at how much that upset me. So what if she had? I didn\u0027t own her. She wasn\u0027t mine.\n No, she wasn\u0027t mine - and I was sad again.\n One of her hands twitched, and I noticed that there were shallow, barely healed scrapes across the heel of her palm. She\u0027d been hurt? Even though it was obviously not a serious injury, it still disturbed me. I considered the location, and decided she must have tripped. That seemed a reasonable explanation, all things considered.\n It was comforting to think that I wouldn\u0027t have to puzzle over either of these small mysteries forever. We were friends now - or, at least, trying to be friends. I could ask her about her weekend - about the beach, and whatever late night activity had made her look so weary. I could ask what had happened to her hands. And I could laugh a little when she confirmed my theory about them.\n I smiled gently as I wondered whether or not she had fallen in the ocean. I wondered if she\u0027d had a pleasant time on the outing. I wondered if she\u0027d thought about me at all. If she\u0027d missed me even the tiniest portion of the amount that I\u0027d missed her. I tried to picture her in the sun on the beach. The picture was incomplete, though, because I\u0027d never been to First Beach myself. I only knew how it looked in pictures... I felt a tiny qualm of unease as I thought about the reason why I\u0027d never once been to the pretty beach located just a few minutes run from my home. Bella had spent the day at La Push - a place where I was forbidden, by treaty, to go. A place where a few old men still remembered the stories about the Cullens, remembered and believed them. A place where our secret was known...\n I shook my head. I had nothing to worry about there. The Quileutes were bound by treaty, too. Even had Bella run into one of those aging sages, they could reveal nothing. And why would the subject ever be broached? Why would Bella think to voice her curiosity there? No - the Quileutes were perhaps the one thing I did not have to worry about.\n I was angry with the sun when it began to rise. It reminded me that I could not satisfy my curiosity for days to come. Why did it choose to shine now?\n With a sigh, I ducked out her window before it was light enough for anyone to see me here. I meant to stay in the thick forest by her house and see her off to school, but when I got into the trees, I was surprised to find the trace of her scent lingering on the trail there.\n I followed it quickly, curiously, becoming more and more worried as it led deeper into the darkness. What had Bella been doing out here?\n The trail stopped abruptly, in the middle of nowhere in particular. She\u0027d gone just a few steps off the trail, into the ferns, where she\u0027d touched the trunk of a fallen tree. Perhaps sat there...\n I sat where she had, and looked around. All she would have been able to see was ferns and forest. It had probably been raining - the scent was washed out, having never set deeply into the tree.\n Why would Bella have come to sit here alone - and she had been alone, no doubt about that - in the middle of the wet, murky forest?\n It made no sense, and, unlike those other points of curiosity, I could hardly bring this up in casual conversation.\n So, Bella, I was following your scent through the woods after I left your room where I\u0027d been watching you sleep... Yes, that would be quite the ice breaker. I would never know what she\u0027d been thinking and doing here, and that had my teeth grinding together in frustration. Worse, this was far too much like the scenario I\u0027d imagined for Emmett - Bella wandering alone in the woods, where her scent would call to anyone who had the senses to track it...\n I groaned. Not only did she have bad luck, but she courted it.\n Well, for this moment she had a protector. I would watch over her, keep her from harm, for as long as I could justify it.\n I suddenly found myself wishing that Peter and Charlotte would make an extended stay.\n \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-twilight-saga-5-midnight-sun-twilight-2/page-7.html","bookId":2027,"book":{"id":2027,"title":"The Twilight Saga 5: Midnight Sun (Twilight #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Midnight Sun is an expected companion novel to the book Twilight by author Stephenie Meyer. It would be the retelling of the events of Twilight, but written from the perspective of Edward Cullen as opposed to that of Bella Swan. Meyer has stated that Twilight is the only book from the series that she plans to rewrite from Edward\u0027s perspective. To give them a better feel of Edward\u0027s character, Meyer allowed Catherine Hardwicke, the director of the film adaptation of Twilight, and Robert Pattinson, the actor playing Edward, to read some completed chapters of the novel while they filmed the movie.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-twilight-saga-5-midnight-sun-twilight-2.jpg","author":"Stephenie Meyer","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-twilight-saga-5-midnight-sun-twilight-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:16 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:16:27 PM"}}
