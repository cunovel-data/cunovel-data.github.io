For weeks he\u0027d prayed that this moment would not come. But soon, after ruling the Order wisely for twenty-eight years, the old man lying on the bed would achieve a well-earned peace and join his predecessors in heaven. Unfortunately for the seneschal, the tumult of the physical world would continue, and he dreaded that prospect.\n The room was spacious, the ancient stone-and-wood walls free of decay, only the pine-hammered ceiling beams blackened by age. A solitary window, like a somber eye, broke the exterior wall and framed the beauty of a waterfall matted by a stark gray mountain. A growing dusk thickened the room\u0027s corners.\n The seneschal reached for the old man\u0027s hand. The grip was cold and clammy. \"Can you hear me, Master?\" he asked in French.\n The tired eyes opened. \"I am not gone as yet. But soon.\"\n He\u0027d heard others in their final hour make similar statements and wondered if the body simply did exhaust itself, lacking the energy to compel lungs to breath or a heart to beat, death finally conquering where life had once flourished. He gripped the hand tighter. \"I\u0027ll miss you.\"\n A smile came to the thin lips. \"You have served me well, as I knew you would. That\u0027s why I chose you.\"\n \"There will be much conflict in the days ahead.\"\n \"You are ready. I have seen to it.\"\n He was the seneschal, second only to the master. He\u0027d risen fast through the ranks, too fast for some, and only the master\u0027s firm leadership had quelled the discontent. But death would soon claim his protector and he feared open revolt might follow.\n \"There is no guarantee I\u0027ll succeed you.\"\n \"You underestimate yourself.\"\n \"I respect the power of our adversaries.\"\n A silence washed over them, allowing the larks and blackbirds beyond the window to announce their presence. He stared down at his master. The old man wore an azure smock besprinkled with golden stars. Though the facial features were sharpened by his approaching death, there remained a vigor to the old man\u0027s lean form. A gray beard hung long and unkempt, the hands and feet constricted with arthritis, but the eyes continued to glisten. He knew twenty-eight years of leadership had taught the old warrior much. Perhaps the most vital lesson was how to project, even in the face of death, a mask of civility.\n The doctor had confirmed the cancer months ago. As required by Rule, the disease was allowed to run its course, the natural consequences of God\u0027s action accepted. Thousands of brothers through the centuries had endured the same end, and it was unthinkable that the master would soil their tradition.\n \"I wish I could smell the water\u0027s spray,\" the old man whispered.\n The seneschal glanced toward the window. Its sixteenth-century panes were swung open, allowing the sweet aroma of wet stone and verdant greens to seep into his nostrils. The distant water roared in a bubbly tenor. \"Your room offers the perfect venue.\"\n \"One of the reasons I wanted to be master.\"\n He smiled, knowing the old man was being facetious. He\u0027d read the Chronicles and knew that his mentor had ascended by being able to grasp each turn of fortune with the adaptiveness of a genius. His tenure had been one of peace, but all that would soon change.\n \"I should pray for your soul,\" the seneschal said.\n \"Time for that later. Instead, you must prepare.\"\n \"For what?\"\n \"The conclave. Gather your votes. Be ready. Do not allow your enemies time to rally. Remember all I taught you.\" The hoarse voice cracked with infirmity, but there was a firmness in the tone\u0027s foundation.\n \"I\u0027m not sure that I want to be master.\"\n \"You do.\"\n His friend knew him well. Modesty required that he shun the mantle, but more than anything he wanted to be the next master.\n He felt the hand within his shiver. A few shallow breaths were needed for the old man to steady himself.\n \"I have prepared the message. It is there, on the desk.\"\n He knew it would be the next master\u0027s duty to study that testament.\n \"The duty must be done,\" the master said. \"As it has been done since the Beginning.\"\n The seneschal did not want to hear about duty. He was more concerned with emotion. He looked around the room, which contained only the bed, a prie-dieu that faced a wooden crucifix, three chairs protected by an old tapestried cushion, a writing desk, and two aged marble statues standing in wall niches. There was a time when the chamber would have been filled with Spanish leather, Delft porcelain, English furniture. But audacity had long been purged from the Order\u0027s character.\n As from his own.\n The old man gasped for air.\n He stared down at the man lying in an uneasy slumber of disease. The master gathered his wind, blinked a few times, then said, \"Not yet, old friend. But soon.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-templar-legacy-cotton-malone-1/page-4.html","bookId":2232,"book":{"id":2232,"title":"The Templar Legacy (Cotton Malone #1)","description":"Storyline: \n The Templar Legacy (Cotton Malone #1) \n The ancient order of the Knights Templar possessed untold wealth and absolute power over kings and popes . . . until the Inquisition, when they were wiped from the face of the earth, their hidden riches lost. But now two forces vying for the treasure have learned that it is not at all what they thought it was-and its true nature could change the modern world. \n Cotton Malone, one-time top operative for the U.S. Justice Department, is enjoying his quiet new life as an antiquarian book dealer in Copenhagen when an unexpected call to action reawakens his hair-trigger instincts-and plunges him back into the cloak-and-dagger world he thought he\u0027d left behind. \n It begins with a violent robbery attempt on Cotton\u0027s former supervisor, Stephanie Nelle, who\u0027s far from home on a mission that has nothing to do with national security. Armed with vital clues to a series of centuries-old puzzles scattered across Europe, she means to crack a mystery that has tantalized scholars and fortune-hunters through the ages by finding the legendary cache of wealth and forbidden knowledge thought to have been lost forever when the order of the Knights Templar was exterminated in the fourteenth century. But she\u0027s not alone. Competing for the historic prize-and desperate for the crucial information Stephanie possesses-is Raymond de Roquefort, a shadowy zealot with an army of assassins at his command. \n Welcome or not, Cotton seeks to even the odds in the perilous race. But the more he learns about the ancient conspiracy surrounding the Knights Templar, the more he realizes that even more than lives are at stake. At the end of a lethal game of conquest, rife with intrigue, treachery, and craven lust for power, lies a shattering discovery that could rock the civilized world-and, in the wrong hands, bring it to its knees. \"From the Hardcover edition.\"\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-templar-legacy-cotton-malone-1.jpg","author":"Steve Berry","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-templar-legacy-cotton-malone-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:28 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:11:07 PM"}}
