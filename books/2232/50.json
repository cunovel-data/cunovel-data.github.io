No movement. No voices. Nothing. Brother Geoffrey stood beside him. He remained worried that he was being set up. Which was why he\u0027d come with firepower. He was pleased with his council\u0027s selection of knights--these men were some of the best in his ranks, experienced fighters of unquestioned courage and fortitude--which he might well need.\\n\\n He peered around a pile of lichen-encrusted rubble, deeper into the decayed structure, past billows of standing grass. The bright dome of sky overhead was fading as the sun beat a retreat behind the mountains. Darkness would arrive shortly. And he worried about the weather. Squalls and rain came without warning in the Pyrenean summer.\\n\\n He motioned and his men advanced forward, clambering over boulders and collapsed wall sections. He spied a campsite among three partial walls. Wood had been arranged for a fire that had yet to be lit.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll go in,\" Geoffrey whispered. \"They\u0027re expecting me.\"\\n\\n He saw the wisdom of that move and nodded.\\n\\n Geoffrey calmly walked into the open and approached the camp. Still no one was around. Then the younger man disappeared deeper into the ruins. A moment later he emerged and signaled for them to come.\\n\\n De Roquefort told his men to wait and only he stepped into the open. He\u0027d already directed his lieutenant to attack if necessary.\\n\\n \"Only Thorvaldsen is in the church,\" Geoffrey said.\\n\\n \"What church?\"\\n\\n \"The monks cut a church into the rock. They\u0027ve discovered a portal beneath the altar that leads to caves. The others are beneath us exploring. I told Thorvaldsen that I was going to retrieve the supplies.\"\\n\\n He liked what he was hearing.\\n\\n \"I\u0027d want to meet Henrik Thorvaldsen.\"\\n\\n With gun in hand, he followed Geoffrey into the dungeon-like cavity carved from the rock. Thorvaldsen stood with his back to them, gazing down into what was once a support for the altar.\\n\\n The old man turned as they came close.\\n\\n De Roquefort raised his gun. \"Not a word. Or it will be your last.\"\\n\\n THE EARTH BENEATH STEPHANIE\u0027S FEET HAD GIVEN WAY AND HER legs were collapsing into one of the traps they\u0027d tried so hard to avoid. What had she been thinking? Seeing the words etched into the rock and then the metal gate waiting to be opened, she\u0027d realized that her husband had been right. So she\u0027d abandoned caution and raced forward. Mark had tried to stop her. She heard him scream, but it had been too late.\\n\\n She was already heading down.\\n\\n Her hands went skyward in an attempt to balance and she readied herself for the bronze stakes. But then she felt an arm encase her chest in a tight embrace. Then she was falling backward, to the ground, which she struck, another body cushioning her impact.\\n\\n A second later, quiet.\\n\\n Mark lay beneath her.\\n\\n \"You okay?\" she asked, rolling off him.\\n\\n Her son raised himself off the gravel. \"Those rocks felt lovely on my back.\"\\n\\n Heavy footsteps sounded in the darkness behind them, accompanied by two orbs of waggling light. Malone and Cassiopeia appeared.\\n\\n \"What happened?\" Malone asked.\\n\\n \"I was careless,\" she said, standing, brushing herself off.\\n\\n Malone shone a light down into the rectangular hole. \"That would have been a bloody fall. It\u0027s full of stakes, all in good shape.\"\\n\\n She came close, stared down into the opening, then turned and said to Mark, \"Thanks, son.\"\\n\\n Mark was rubbing the back of his neck, working the pain from his muscles. \"No problem.\"\\n\\n \"Malone,\" Cassiopeia said. \"Take a look.\"\\n\\n Stephanie watched as Malone and Cassiopeia studied the Templar motto she and Mark had found. \"I was headed to that gate when the hole got in the way.\"\\n\\n \"Two of them,\" Malone muttered. \"At opposite ends of this corridor.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s another grille?\" Mark asked.\\n\\n \"With another inscription.\"\\n\\n She listened as Malone told them what they\u0027d found.\\n\\n \"I agree with you,\" Mark said. \"That skeleton has to be our long-lost marshal.\" He fished a chain from beneath his shirt. \"We all wear the medallion. They\u0027re given at induction.\"\\n\\n \"Apparently,\" Malone said, \"the Templars hedged their bets and separated the cache.\" He motioned to the floor trap. \"And they made it a challenge to find. The marshal should have been more careful.\" Malone faced Stephanie. \"As we all should.\"\\n\\n \"I understand,\" she said. \"But, as you so often remind me, I\u0027m not a field agent.\"\\n\\n He smiled at her sarcasm. \"So let\u0027s see what\u0027s behind that grille.\"\\n\\n DE ROQUEFORT AIMED THE SHORT BARREL OF HIS WEAPON DIRECTLY at Henrik Thorvaldsen\u0027s furrowed brow. \"I\u0027m told you\u0027re one of the wealthiest men in Europe.\"\\n\\n \"And I\u0027m told you\u0027re one of the most ambitious prelates in recent memory.\"\\n\\n \"You shouldn\u0027t listen to Mark Nelle.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t. His father told me.\"\\n\\n \"His father didn\u0027t know me.\"\\n\\n \"I wouldn\u0027t say that. You followed him around enough.\"\\n\\n \"Which turned out to be a waste of time.\"\\n\\n \"Did that make it easier for you to kill him?\"\\n\\n \"Is that what you think? That I killed Lars Nelle?\"\\n\\n \"Him and Ernst Scoville.\"\\n\\n \"You know nothing, old man.\"\\n\\n \"I know you\u0027re a problem.\" Thorvaldsen motioned to Geoffrey. \"I know he\u0027s a traitor to his friend. And his Order.\"\\n\\n De Roquefort watched as Geoffrey absorbed the insult, disdain sweeping into the younger man\u0027s pale gray eyes, then just as quickly dissipating.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m loyal to my master. That\u0027s the oath I took.\"\\n\\n \"So you betrayed us for your oath?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t expect you to understand.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t, and never will.\"\\n\\n De Roquefort lowered his gun, then gestured for his men. They swarmed into the church and he motioned for silence. A few hand signals and they instantly understood that six were to position themselves outside and the remaining six to encircle the interior.\\n\\n MALONE STEPPED AROUND THE TRAP STEPHANIE HAD EXPOSED and approached the metal grille. The others followed. He noticed a heart-shaped padlock suspended from a chain. \"Brass.\" He caressed the gate. \"But the gate is bronze.\"\\n\\n \"The padlock and chain have to be from Sauniere\u0027s time,\" Mark said. \"Brass was a rare Middle Age commodity. Zinc was needed to make it and that was hard to come by.\"\\n\\n \"The lock is a coeur-de-brass,\" Cassiopeia said. \"They were once prevalent all over this region to fasten slave chains.\"\\n\\n None of them moved to open the gate and Malone knew why. Another trap could lie in wait.\\n\\n With his boot, he gently brushed the soil and gravel beneath his feet and tested the earth. Solid. He used his light and examined the gate\u0027s exterior. Two bronze hinges supported the right edge. He shone the light through the grille. The corridor beyond right-angled sharply a few feet inside and nothing could be seen past the bend. Great. He tested the chain and lock. \"This brass is still strong. We\u0027re not going to able to pound it away.\"\\n\\n \"How about cutting it?\" Cassiopeia asked.\\n\\n \"That would work. But with what?\"\\n\\n \"The bolt cutters I brought. They\u0027re in the tool bag topside, by the generator.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll go get them,\" Mark said.\\n\\n \"ANYBODY UP THERE?\"\\n\\n The words echoed from inside the hollow altar support and startled de Roquefort. Then he quickly realized that the voice was Mark Nelle\u0027s. Thorvaldsen moved to answer, but de Roquefort grabbed the crooked old man and clamped a hand across the mouth before he could utter a sound. He then signaled for one of the brothers, who rushed forward and grabbed the kicking Dane, a new hand sheathing Thorvaldsen\u0027s mouth. He pointed and the prisoner was dragged to a far corner of the church.\\n\\n \"Answer him,\" he mouthed to Geoffrey.\\n\\n This would be an interesting test of his newfound ally\u0027s loyalty.\\n\\n Geoffrey stuffed his gun between his belt and stepped to the altar. \"I\u0027m here.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re back. Good. Any problems?\"\\n\\n \"None. Bought everything on the list. What\u0027s happening down there?\"\\n\\n \"We found something, but we need bolt cutters. They\u0027re in the tool bag by the generator.\"\\n\\n He watched as Geoffrey moved toward the generator and removed a pair of heavy-duty bolt cutters.\\n\\n What had they found?\\n\\n Geoffrey tossed the tool down.\\n\\n \"Thanks,\" Mark Nelle said. \"You coming?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll stay here with Thorvaldsen and keep an eye on things. We don\u0027t need any uninvited guests.\"\\n\\n \"Good idea. Where\u0027s Henrik?\"\\n\\n \"Unpacking what I bought and getting the camp ready for the night. The sun\u0027s nearly gone. I\u0027ll go help him.\"\\n\\n \"You might want to get the generator ready and the power cords unraveled for the light bars. We may need those shortly.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll take care of it.\"\\n\\n Geoffrey lingered a moment more then stepped away from the altar and whispered, \"He\u0027s gone.\"\\n\\n De Roquefort knew what had to be done. \"Time to take command of this expedition.\"\\n\\n MALONE GRIPPED THE BOLT CUTTERS AND WORKED THE TEETH around the brass chain. He then compressed the handles and allowed the spring-action to bite clean through the metal. A snap signaled success and the chain, with hasp, slipped to the ground.\\n\\n Cassiopeia bent down and retrieved them. \"There are museums around the world that would love to have this. I\u0027m sure not many have survived in this condition.\"\\n\\n \"And we just cut it,\" Stephanie said.\\n\\n \"There wasn\u0027t a whole lot of choice,\" Malone said. \"We\u0027re kind of in a hurry.\" He pointed a flashlight through the grille. \"Everybody to the side. I\u0027m going to open this thing slowly. It looks clear, but you never know.\"\\n\\n He wedged the bolt cutters into the grille, then stepped to one side, using the rock wall for protection. The hinges were stiff and he had to work the grille back and forth. Finally, the portal opened.\\n\\n He was just about to lead the way inside when a voice called down from above.\\n\\n \"Mr. Malone. I have Henrik Thorvaldsen. I need for you and your companions to come up. Now. I\u0027ll give you one minute, then I\u0027m going to shoot this old man dead.\"\\n\\n SIXTY-TWO\\n\\n MALONE WAS THE LAST TO CLIMB UP. WHEN HE STEPPED FROM THE ladder he saw that the church was occupied by six armed men along with de Roquefort. Outside, the sun was gone. Inside was now illuminated from the glow of two small fires, the smoke rushing out into the night through the open window slits.\\n\\n \"Mr. Malone, we finally meet in person,\" Raymond de Roquefort said. \"You handled yourself well in the Roskilde cathedral.\"\\n\\n \"Glad to know you\u0027re a fan.\"\\n\\n \"How did you find us?\" Mark asked.\\n\\n \"Certainly no thanks to that phony journal of your father\u0027s, clever though he was. He spoke to the obvious and changed the details just enough to make them worthless. When monsieur Claridon deciphered the cryptogram within it, the message, of course, was of no help. He told us that he concealed the secrets of God. Tell me, since you\u0027ve been down there, does he conceal those secrets?\"\\n\\n \"Never got a chance to find out,\" Malone said.\\n\\n \"Then we should remedy that. But to answer your question--\"\\n\\n \"Geoffrey betrayed us,\" Thorvaldsen said.\\n\\n Astonishment clouded Mark\u0027s face. \"What?\"\\n\\n Malone had already noticed the gun in Geoffrey\u0027s hand. \"That true?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m a brother in the Temple, loyal to my master. I did my duty.\"\\n\\n \"Your duty?\" Mark screamed. \"You lying son of a bitch.\" Mark lurched toward Geoffrey, but two brothers blocked the way. Geoffrey stayed rooted. \"You led me on this whole thing just so de Roquefort could win? Is that what our master meant to you? He trusted you. I trusted you.\"\\n\\n \"I knew you were a problem,\" Cassiopeia declared. \"Everything about you signaled trouble.\"\\n\\n \"And you should know,\" de Roquefort said, \"as that\u0027s what you have been to me. Leaving Lars Nelle\u0027s journal for me to find in Avignon. You thought that would occupy me for a while. But you see, mademoiselle, the loyalty of our brotherhood takes precedence. So your efforts have all been for naught.\" De Roquefort faced Malone. \"I have six men here, six outside--and they know how to handle themselves. You have no weapons, or so brother Geoffrey has informed me. But to be safe.\" De Roquefort motioned and one of the men frisked Malone, then moved to the others.\\n\\n \"What did you do, call the abbey when you left here to get supplies?\" Mark asked Geoffrey. \"I wondered why you volunteered. You haven\u0027t let me out of your sight in two days.\"\\n\\n Geoffrey continued to stand, his face stiff with conviction.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re a disgusting excuse for a man,\" Mark spat out.\\n\\n \"I agree,\" de Roquefort said, and Malone watched as de Roquefort\u0027s gun came level and he fired three shots into Geoffrey\u0027s chest. The bullets staggered the younger man back, and de Roquefort finished his assassination with a bullet to head.\\n\\n Geoffrey\u0027s body collapsed to the floor. Blood poured from the wounds. Malone bit his lip. There was nothing he could do.\\n\\n Mark lunged at de Roquefort.\\n\\n The gun was aimed at Mark\u0027s chest.\\n\\n He stopped.\\n\\n \"He assaulted me at the abbey,\" de Roquefort said. \"Attacking the master is punishable by death.\"\\n\\n \"Not in five hundred years,\" Mark yelled.\\n\\n \"He was a traitor. To you and to me. Neither of us has any use for him. That\u0027s the occupational hazard of being a spy. He surely knew the risk he was taking.\"\\n\\n \"Do you know the risks you\u0027re taking?\"\\n\\n \"A strange question coming from a man who killed a brother of this Order. That act is punishable by death, too.\"\\n\\n Malone realized this show was for the others present. De Roquefort needed his enemy, at least for the moment.\\n\\n \"I did what I had to,\" Mark spit out.\\n\\n De Roquefort clicked the hammer of the automatic into place. \"So will I.\"\\n\\n Stephanie stepped between the two men, her body blocking Mark\u0027s. \"And will you kill me, too?\"\\n\\n \"If need be.\"\\n\\n \"But I\u0027m a Christian and I haven\u0027t harmed any brothers.\"\\n\\n \"Words, dear lady. Only words.\"\\n\\n She reached up and fished out a chain with a medal from around her neck. \"The Virgin. She goes with me wherever I go.\"\\n\\n Malone knew de Roquefort could not shoot her. She\u0027d sensed the theater, too, and called his bluff before his men. De Roquefort could not afford to be a hypocrite. He was impressed. It took balls to face down a loaded gun. Not bad for a desk jockey.\\n\\n De Roquefort lowered the weapon.\\n\\n Malone rushed toward Geoffrey\u0027s bleeding body. One of the men raised a hand to stop him. \"I\u0027d drop that arm if I were you,\" he made clear.\\n\\n \"Let him pass,\" de Roquefort said.\\n\\n He came close to the body. Henrik stood staring down at the corpse. A pained look filled the Dane\u0027s face and he saw something he\u0027d not seen in the year he\u0027d known him.\\n\\n Tears.\\n\\n \"You and I will go back down,\" de Roquefort said to Mark, \"and you\u0027ll show me what you found. The others will stay here.\"\\n\\n \"Screw yourself.\"\\n\\n De Roquefort shrugged and aimed his gun at Thorvaldsen. \"He\u0027s a Jew. Different rules.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t push it,\" Malone said to Mark. \"Do as he says.\" He hoped Mark understood that there was a time to hold and a time to fold.\\n\\n \"All right. We\u0027ll go down,\" Mark said.\\n\\n \"I\u0027d like to come,\" Malone said.\\n\\n \"No,\" de Roquefort said. \"This is a matter for the brotherhood. Though I never considered Nelle one of us, he took the oath, and that counts for something. Besides, his expertise might be needed. You, on the other hand, could become a problem.\"\\n\\n \"How do you know Mark will behave?\"\\n\\n \"He will. Otherwise, Christians or no, all of you will die before he could ever climb out that hole.\"\\n\\n MARK DESCENDED THE LADDER, FOLLOWED BY DE ROQUEFORT. HE pointed left and told de Roquefort about the chamber they\u0027d found.\\n\\n De Roquefort slid his gun back into a shoulder holster and aimed his flashlight ahead. \"You lead the way. And you know what happens if there are any problems.\"\\n\\n Mark started walking, his flashlight added to de Roquefort\u0027s beam. They eased their way around the staked hole that had almost claimed Stephanie.\\n\\n \"Ingenious,\" de Roquefort said as he examined the pit.\\n\\n They found the open grille.\\n\\n Mark recalled Malone\u0027s warning about more traps and took only baby steps forward. The passage beyond narrowed to about a yard wide, then angled sharply right. After only a few feet, another angle back to the left. One step at a time, he inched ahead.\\n\\n He made the final turn and stopped.\\n\\n He shone his light and saw before him a chamber, perhaps ten yards square with a high rounded ceiling. Cassiopeia\u0027s assessment that the subterranean vaults might be of Roman origin seemed correct. The gallery formed a perfect repository, and as his light dissolved the darkness, a multitude of wonders came into view.\\n\\n He first saw statuary. Small colorful pieces. Several enthroned Virgins and Child. Gilded pietas. Angels. Busts. All in straight rows, like soldiers, across the rear wall. Then the glint of gold from rectangular chests. Some overlaid with ivory panels, others sheathed in a mosaic of onyx and gilt, a few gilded in copper and decorated with coats of arms and religious scenes. Each was too precious for simple storage. They were reliquary caskets, made for the remains of holy saints, probably commandeered in the rush, anything to hold what they needed to transport.\\n\\n He heard de Roquefort slip off the backpack he was wearing, and suddenly the room was engulfed in a bright orange glow from a battery-powered light bar. De Roquefort handed him one. \"These will work better.\"\\n\\n He didn\u0027t like cooperating with the monster, but knew he was right. He grabbed the light, and they fanned out to see what the room contained.\\n\\n \"COVER HIM UP,\" MALONE SAID TO ONE OF THE BROTHERS, MOTIONING at Geoffrey.\\n\\n \"With what?\" came the question.\\n\\n \"The power cords for the light bars are wrapped in a blanket. I can use that.\" He motioned across the church, past one of the burning fires.\\n\\n The man seemed to consider the inquiry a moment, then said, \"Oui. Do it.\"\\n\\n Malone stomped across the uneven floor and found the blanket, all the while assessing their situation. He returned and draped Geoffrey\u0027s body. Three guards had withdrawn to the other fire. The remaining three were stationed near the exit.\\n\\n \"He wasn\u0027t a traitor,\" Henrik whispered.\\n\\n They all stared at him. \"He came in alone and told me that de Roquefort was here. He called him. He had to. The former master made him pledge that, once the Devise was found, de Roquefort would be told. He had no choice. He didn\u0027t want to do it, but he trusted the old man. He told me to play along, begged my forgiveness, and said he\u0027d look after me. Unfortunately, I couldn\u0027t return the favor.\"\\n\\n \"That was foolish of him,\" Cassiopeia said.\\n\\n \"Maybe,\" Thorvaldsen said. \"But his word meant something to him.\"\\n\\n \"Did he say why he had to tell him?\" Stephanie muttered.\\n\\n \"Only that the master foretold a confrontation between Mark and de Roquefort. Geoffrey\u0027s task was to ensure one.\"\\n\\n \"Mark\u0027s no match for that man,\" Malone said. \"He\u0027s going to need help.\"\\n\\n \"I agree,\" Cassiopeia added, talking through her teeth, her mouth not moving.\\n\\n \"The odds aren\u0027t good,\" Malone said. \"Twelve men armed, and we\u0027re not.\"\\n\\n \"I wouldn\u0027t say that,\" Cassiopeia whispered.\\n\\n And he liked the twinkle in her eye.\\n\\n MARK STUDIED THE TREASURE THAT SURROUNDED HIM. HE\u0027D never seen so much wealth. The reliquary caskets contained a variety of silver and gold, either in coinage or as unminted raw metal. There were gold dinars, silver drachmas, and Byzantine coins, all stacked in neat rows. And jewels. Three chests brimmed with rough stones. Too many to even imagine. Chalices and reliquary vessels caught his gaze, most of ebony, glass, silver, and parcel-gilt. Some were coated with relief figures and dotted in precious stones. He wondered whose remnants they supposedly contained. One he knew for sure. He read the engraving and whispered, \"De Molay,\" as he stared into the reliquary\u0027s rock crystal tube.\\n\\n De Roquefort came close.\\n\\n Inside the reliquary were bits of blackened bone. Mark knew the tale. Jacques de Molay was roasted alive on an island in the Seine, in the shadow of Notre Dame, shrieking his innocence and cursing Philip IV, who\u0027d dispassionately watched the execution. During the night brothers swam the river and scrounged through the hot ashes. They swam back with the acrid bones of de Molay in their mouths. Now he was staring at one of those mementos.\\n\\n De Roquefort crossed himself and mumbled a prayer. \"Look what they did.\"\\n\\n But Mark realized an even greater significance. \"This means someone visited this place after March 1314. They must have kept coming back until they all died. Five of them knew about this place. The Black Death surely took them in the mid-1300s. But they never told a soul, and this vault was lost forever.\" A sadness swept over him at the thought.\\n\\n He turned and his light revealed crucifixes and statuary of ebonized wood dotting one wall, about forty, the styles varying from Romanesque, to German, to Byzantine, to high Gothic, the intricately carved physical undulations so perfect they seemed to almost breathe.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s spectacular,\" de Roquefort said.\\n\\n The tally was incalculable, the stone niches that spanned two walls were packed full. Mark had studied in detail the history and purpose of medieval carving from the pieces that survived in museums, but here before him was a broad, spectacular display of Middle Age craftsmanship.\\n\\n To his right, on a stone pedestal, he spotted an oversized book. The cover still gleamed--gold foil, he surmised--and was dotted with pearls. Someone had apparently opened the volume before, as crumbled parchment lay beneath, scattered like leaves. He bent down, brought the light close to the scraps, and saw Latin. He could read some of the script and quickly determined that it had once been an inventory ledger.\\n\\n De Roquefort noticed his interest. \"What is it?\"\\n\\n \"An accounting. Sauniere probably tried to examine it when he found this place. But you have to careful with parchment.\"\\n\\n \"Thief. That\u0027s what he was. Nothing but a common thief. He had no right to take any of this.\"\\n\\n \"And we do?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s ours. Left for us by de Molay himself. He was crucified on a door, yet told them nothing. His bones are here. This is ours.\"\\n\\n Mark\u0027s attention was diverted to a partially open chest. He shone his light and saw more parchment. He slowly hinged open the lid, which only slightly resisted. He dared not touch the sheets stacked together. So he strained to decipher what was on the top page. Old French, he quickly concluded. He could read enough to know that it was a will.\\n\\n \"Papers the Order was safekeeping. This chest is probably full of thirteenth- and fourteenth-century wills and deeds.\" He shook his head. \"To the end, the brothers made sure their duty was done.\" He considered the possibilities that lay before him. \"What we could learn from these documents.\"\\n\\n \"This is not all of it,\" de Roquefort suddenly declared. \"No books. Not one. Where\u0027s the knowledge?\"\\n\\n \"What you see is it.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re lying. There\u0027s more. Where?\"\\n\\n He faced de Roquefort. \"This is it.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be coy with me. Our brothers secreted away their knowledge. You know that. Philip never found it. So it has to be here. I can see it in your eyes. There\u0027s more.\" De Roquefort reached for his gun and raised the barrel to Mark\u0027s brow. \"Tell me.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d rather die.\"\\n\\n \"But would you rather have your mother die? Or your friends up there? Because that\u0027s who I\u0027ll kill first, while you watch, until I learn what I want to know.\"\\n\\n Mark considered the possibility. It wasn\u0027t that he was afraid of de Roquefort--strangely, no fear coursed through him--it was simply that he wanted to know, too. His father had searched for years and found nothing. What had the master told his mother about him? He doesn\u0027t possess the resolve needed to complete his battles. Bullshit. The solution to his father\u0027s quest was a short walk away.\\n\\n \"All right. Come with me.\"\\n\\n \"IT\u0027S AWFUL GLOOMY IN HERE,\" MALONE SAID TO THE BROTHER who appeared in charge. \"Mind if we get the generator going and fire up those lights?\"\\n\\n \"We wait for the master to return.\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027re going to need those lights down there, and it takes a few minutes to set things up. Your master may not be inclined to wait when he calls for them.\" He was hoping the prediction might affect the man\u0027s judgment. \"What\u0027s it going to hurt? We\u0027re just rigging up some lights.\"\\n\\n \"Okay. Go ahead.\"\\n\\n Malone withdrew back to where the others stood. \"He bought it. Let\u0027s set \u0027em up.\"\\n\\n Stephanie and Malone moved toward one set, while Henrik and Cassiopeia grabbed another. The bars consisted of two halogen flood lamps atop an orange tripod. The generator was a small gasoline-powered unit. They positioned the tripods at opposite ends of the church and angled the bulbs upward. Power cords were connected and run back to where the generator sat, near the altar.\\n\\n A tool bag lay beside the generator. Cassiopeia was reaching inside when one of the guards stopped her.\\n\\n \"I need to hot-wire the power cords. Can\u0027t use plugs for this kind of ampage. I\u0027m only going to get a screwdriver.\"\\n\\n The man hesitated then stepped back, gun at his side, seemingly ready. Cassiopeia reached into the bag and carefully removed the screwdriver. By the light of the fires, she attached the cords to leads on the generator.\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s check out the connections to the lights,\" she said to Malone.\\n\\n They casually walked to the first tripod. \"My dart gun is in the tool bag,\" she whispered.\\n\\n \"I assume those are the same little darlings used in Copenhagen?\" He kept his lips still as a ventriloquist\u0027s.\\n\\n \"They work fast. I just need a few seconds to fire the shots.\"\\n\\n She was fiddling with the tripod, not doing anything.\\n\\n \"And how many shots do you have?\"\\n\\n She seemingly finished what she was doing. \"Four.\"\\n\\n They headed for the other tripod. \"We have six guests.\"\\n\\n \"The other two are your problem.\"\\n\\n They stopped at the second tripod. He breathed out, \"We\u0027ll need a moment of distraction to confuse everybody.

But now two forces vying for the treasure have learned that it is not at all what they thought it was-and its true nature could change the modern world. \\n Cotton Malone, one-time top operative for the U.S. Justice Department, is enjoying his quiet new life as an antiquarian book dealer in Copenhagen when an unexpected call to action reawakens his hair-trigger instincts-and plunges him back into the cloak-and-dagger world he thought he\u0027d left behind. \\n It begins with a violent robbery attempt on Cotton\u0027s former supervisor, Stephanie Nelle, who\u0027s far from home on a mission that has nothing to do with national security. Armed with vital clues to a series of centuries-old puzzles scattered across Europe, she means to crack a mystery that has tantalized scholars and fortune-hunters through the ages by finding the legendary cache of wealth and forbidden knowledge thought to have been lost forever when the order of the Knights Templar was exterminated in the fourteenth century. But she\u0027s not alone. Competing for the historic prize-and desperate for the crucial information Stephanie possesses-is Raymond de Roquefort, a shadowy zealot with an army of assassins at his command. \\n Welcome or not, Cotton seeks to even the odds in the perilous race. But the more he learns about the ancient conspiracy surrounding the Knights Templar, the more he realizes that even more than lives are at stake. At the end of a lethal game of conquest, rife with intrigue, treachery, and craven lust for power, lies a shattering discovery that could rock the civilized world-and, in the wrong hands, bring it to its knees. \"From the Hardcover edition.\"\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-templar-legacy-cotton-malone-1.jpg","author":"Steve Berry","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-templar-legacy-cotton-malone-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:28 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:11:07 PM"}}
