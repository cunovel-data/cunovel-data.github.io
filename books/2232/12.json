{"id":107815,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"\"WHERE IS LARS NELLE\u0027S JOURNAL?\" DE ROQUEFORT ASKED. Still in the grasp of the two men, Peter Hansen stared up at him. He knew Hansen had once been closely associated with Lars Nelle. When he\u0027d discovered that Stephanie Nelle was coming to Denmark to attend the Roskilde auction, he\u0027d surmised that she might contact Peter Hansen. Which was why he\u0027d approached the book dealer first. \"Surely Stephanie Nelle mentioned her husband\u0027s journal?\" Hansen shook his head. \"Nothing. Nothing at all.\" \"When Lars Nelle was alive, did he mention that he kept a journal?\" \"Never.\" \"Do you understand your situation? Nothing I wanted has occurred and, worse, you deceived me.\" \"I know that Lars kept meticulous notes.\" Resignation filled Hansen\u0027s voice. \"Tell me more.\" Hansen seemed to steel himself. \"When I\u0027m released.\" De Roquefort allowed the fool a victory. He motioned and his men released their hold. Hansen quickly gulped a deep swallow of beer, then tabled the mug. \"Lars wrote lots of books about Rennes-le-Chateau. All that stuff about lost parchments, hidden geometry, and puzzles made for great sales.\" Hansen seemed to catch hold of himself. \"He alluded to every treasure he could imagine. Visigoth gold, Templar wealth, Cathar loot. Take a thread and weave a blanket, that\u0027s what he used to say.\" De Roquefort knew all about Rennes-le-Chateau, a tiny hamlet in southern France that had existed since Roman times. A priest in the latter part of the nineteenth century spent enormous sums of money remodeling the local church. Decades later, rumors started that the priest financed the decorations with a great treasure he\u0027d found. Lars Nelle learned of the intriguing place thirty years ago and wrote a book about the tale, which became an international bestseller. \"So tell me what was recorded in the notebook,\" he asked. \"Information different from Lars Nelle\u0027s published material?\" \"I told you, I don\u0027t know anything about a notebook.\" Hansen grabbed the mug and savored another gulp. \"But knowing Lars, I doubt he told the world everything in those books.\" \"And what was it he concealed?\" A sly smile came to the Dane\u0027s lips. \"As if you don\u0027t already know. But I assure you, I have no idea. I only know what I read in Lars\u0027s books.\" \"I wouldn\u0027t assume anything, if I were you.\" Hansen seemed unfazed. \"So tell me, what\u0027s so important about that book tonight? It\u0027s not even about Rennes-le-Chateau.\" \"It is the key to everything.\" \"How could a nothing book, more than a hundred and fifty years old, be the key to anything?\" \"Many times it\u0027s the simplest of things that are most important.\" Hansen reached for his cigarette. \"Lars was a strange man. I never could figure him out. He was obsessed with the whole Rennes thing. He loved the place. Even bought a house there. I went once. Dreary.\" \"Did Lars say if he found anything?\" Hansen appraised him again with a suspicious glare. \"Like what?\" \"Don\u0027t be coy. I\u0027m not in the mood.\" \"You must know something or you wouldn\u0027t be here.\" Hansen bent down to balance the cigarette back onto the ashtray. But his hand kept going, straight into an open drawer in the side table, and a gun appeared. One of de Roquefort\u0027s men kicked the pistol from the book dealer\u0027s grip. \"That was foolish,\" de Roquefort said. \"Screw you,\" Hansen spat out, rubbing his hand. The radio clipped to de Roquefort\u0027s waist crackled in his ear, and a voice said, \"A man is approaching.\" A pause. \"It\u0027s Malone. Coming straight for the shop.\" Not unexpected, but perhaps it was time to send a clear message that this was not Malone\u0027s affair. He caught the attention of his two subordinates. They advanced and again seized Peter Hansen by the arms. \"Deceit has a price,\" de Roquefort said. \"Who the hell are you?\" \"Someone you should not have toyed with.\" De Roquefort made the sign of the cross. \"May the Lord be with you.\" MALONE SAW LIGHTS IN THE THIRD-FLOOR WINDOWS. THE STREET in front of Hansen\u0027s bookshop was empty. Only a few parked cars lined the dark cobbles, which he knew would all be gone by morning, when shoppers once again invaded this part of the pedestrians-only Stroget. What had Stephanie said earlier when she\u0027d been inside Hansen\u0027s shop? My husband said you were a man who could find the unfindable. So Peter Hansen was apparently connected to Lars Nelle, and that former association would explain why Stephanie had sought out Hansen, rather than coming to him. But it did not answer the multitude of other questions Malone possessed. Malone had never met Lars Nelle. He died about a year after Malone joined the Magellan Billet, at a time when he and Stephanie were just getting to know one another. But he\u0027d subsequently read all of Nelle\u0027s books, which were mixtures of history, fact, conjecture, and grand coincidence. Lars was an international conspiratorialist who\u0027d thought the region of southern France known as the Languedoc harbored some sort of great treasure. Which was partly understandable. The area had long been the land of troubadours, a place of castles and crusades, where the legend of the Holy Grail was first born. Unfortunately, Lars Nelle\u0027s work had not generated any serious scholarship. Instead, his theories only stirred the interest of new age writers and independent filmmakers who expanded on his original premise, ultimately proposing theories that ranged from extraterrestrials, to Roman plunder, to the hidden essence of Christianity itself. Nothing, of course, had ever been proven or found. But Malone was certain the French tourist industry loved the speculation. The book Stephanie had tried to buy at the Roskilde auction was titled Pierres Gravees du Languedoc. Inscribed Stones of the Languedoc. An odd title on an even odder subject. What relevance could it have? He knew that Stephanie had always been unimpressed with her husband\u0027s work. That dispute was the number one problem in their marriage and eventually led to a continental separation--Lars living in France, she in America. So what was she doing in Denmark eleven years after his death? And why were others intent on interfering with her--even to the point of dying? He kept walking and tried to organize his thoughts. He knew Peter Hansen would not be glad to see him, so he told himself to choose his words carefully. He needed to placate the idiot and learn what he could. He\u0027d even pay if he had to. Something burst from one of the top-floor windows in Hansen\u0027s building. He stared up as a body ejected headfirst, flipped in midair, then slammed onto the bonnet of a parked car. He raced forward and saw Peter Hansen. He tried for a pulse. Faint. Amazingly, Hansen opened his eyes. \"Can you hear me?\" he asked Hansen. No response. Something whizzed by close to his head and Hansen\u0027s chest lurched upward. Another swoosh and the skull ripped apart, blood and sinew splattering his jacket. He whirled around. In the shattered window three floors above, a man with a gun stood. The same man in the leather jacket who\u0027d started the shooting in the cathedral--the one intent on assaulting Stephanie. In the instant it took the shooter to re-aim, Malone leaped behind the car. More bullets rained down. The pop of each shot was muffled, like hands clapping. A sound-suppressed weapon. One bullet pinged off the hood next to Hansen. Another shattered the windshield. \"Mr. Malone. This affair does not concern you,\" the man said from above. \"Does now.\" He wasn\u0027t going to stay around and debate the point. He crouched low and used the parked cars as shields while working his way down the street. More shots, like pillows fluffing, tried to find a way through metal and glass. Twenty yards away, he glanced back. The face disappeared from the window. He stood and ran, turning at the first corner. He rounded another, trying to use the labyrinth of streets to his advantage, stacking buildings between him and his pursuers. Blood pounded in his temples. His heart thumped. Damn. He was back in the game. He stopped a moment and gulped in the cool air. Running footsteps were approaching from behind. He wondered if his pursuers knew their way around the Stroget. He had to assume they did. Around another corner and more darkened shops encased him. Tension built in his stomach. He was running out of options. Ahead was one of the district\u0027s many open squares, a fountain churning in the center. All the cafes lining its perimeter were closed for the night. No one was in sight. Hiding places here would be in short supply. Across the empty expanse rose a church. A faint glow was evident through darkened stained-glass windows. In summer, Copenhagen\u0027s churches were all left open to midnight. He needed a place to hide, at least for a while. So he raced across to its marble portal. The lock clicked open. He shoved the leadened door inward, then closed it gently, hoping his pursuers wouldn\u0027t notice. Scattered incandescent fixtures lit the empty interior. An impressive altar and sculpted statues cast ghostly images through the sullen air. He searched the darkness toward the altar and spotted stairs and a pallid glow from below. He headed for it and descended, a cold cloud of worry filling him. An iron gate at the bottom opened into a three-naved wide space with a low vaulted ceiling. Two stone sarcophagi topped with immense slabs of carved granite stood in the center. The only break in the darkness came from a tiny amber light near a small altar. This seemed like a good place to park for a while. He couldn\u0027t go back to his shop. They certainly knew where he lived. He told himself to calm down, but his momentary relief was shattered by a door opening above. His gaze shot to the top of the vault not three feet from the crown of his head. Two sets of footsteps bounded across the floor above. He moved deeper into the shadows. His mind filled with a familiar panic, which he suppressed with a wave of self-control. He needed something to defend himself with, so he searched the darkness. In an apse twenty feet away he spotted an iron candelabrum. He crept over. The ornament stood about five feet tall, a solitary wax candle, about four inches thick, rising from its center. He removed the candle and tested the metal stem. Heavy. With the candelabrum in hand, he tiptoed across the crypt and took up a position behind another pillar. Someone started down the steps. He peered past the tombs, through the blackness, his body alive with an energy that had always, in the past, clarified his thoughts. At the base of the stairs appeared the silhouette of a man. He carried a gun, a sound suppressor at the end of the barrel distinctive even in shadow. Malone tightened his grip on the iron stem and cocked his arm. The man was moving toward him. His muscles tensed. He silently counted to five, clenched his teeth, then swung the candelabrum and caught the man square in the chest, propelling the shadow back onto one of the tombs. He tossed the iron aside and swung his fist into the man\u0027s jaw. The pistol flew away and rattled across the floor. His attacker went down. He searched for the gun as another set of footsteps bounded into the crypt. He found the pistol and locked his hand on the grip. Two shots came in his direction. Dust snowed down from the ceiling as bullets found stone. He dove for the nearest pillar and fired. A muffled retort sent a shot through the darkness, ricocheting off the far wall. The second attacker stopped his advance, taking up a position behind the farther tomb. Now he was trapped. Between him and the only way out was an armed man. The first pursuer was starting to come to his feet, groaning from the blows. Malone was armed, but the odds weren\u0027t good. He stared through the dimly lit chamber and readied himself. The man rising from the floor suddenly collapsed back down. A few seconds passed. Silence. One set of footsteps echoed from above. Then the church door opened and closed. He did not move. The stillness was unnerving. His gaze raked the darkness. No movement anywhere. He decided to risk it and crept forward. The first assailant lay sprawled on the floor. The other man was likewise prone and still. He checked both men for pulses. Beating, but weak. Then he spotted something at the back of one of the necks. He bent close and plucked out a small dart, the tip a half-inch needle. His savior was privy to some sophisticated equipment. The two men lying on the floor were the same two from outside the auction earlier. But who\u0027d disabled them? He bent back down and retrieved both guns, then searched the bodies. No identification on either. One man wore a radio beneath his jacket. He removed the unit along with the earpiece and microphone. \"Anyone there?\" he said into the mike. \"And who is this?\" \"You the same man that was in the cathedral? The one who just killed Peter Hansen.\" \"Half correct.\" He realized no one was going to say much over an open channel, but the message was clear. \"Your men are down.\" \"Your doing?\" \"Wish I could take credit. Who are you?\" \"That\u0027s not relevant to our discussion.\" \"How was Peter Hansen a problem for you?\" \"I detest those who deceive me.\" \"Obviously. But somebody just caught your two guys by surprise. I don\u0027t know who, but I like them.\" No response. He waited a moment more and was about to speak when the radio crackled. \"I trust you will take advantage of your good fortune and go back to selling books.\" The other radio clicked off.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-templar-legacy-cotton-malone-1/page-12.html","bookId":2232,"book":{"id":2232,"title":"The Templar Legacy (Cotton Malone #1)","description":"Storyline: The Templar Legacy (Cotton Malone #1) The ancient order of the Knights Templar possessed untold wealth and absolute power over kings and popes . . . until the Inquisition, when they were wiped from the face of the earth, their hidden riches lost.

Armed with vital clues to a series of centuries-old puzzles scattered across Europe, she means to crack a mystery that has tantalized scholars and fortune-hunters through the ages by finding the legendary cache of wealth and forbidden knowledge thought to have been lost forever when the order of the Knights Templar was exterminated in the fourteenth century. But she\u0027s not alone. Competing for the historic prize-and desperate for the crucial information Stephanie possesses-is Raymond de Roquefort, a shadowy zealot with an army of assassins at his command. Welcome or not, Cotton seeks to even the odds in the perilous race. But the more he learns about the ancient conspiracy surrounding the Knights Templar, the more he realizes that even more than lives are at stake.
