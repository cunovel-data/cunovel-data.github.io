{"id":6074,"no":24,"title":"Chapter 24","content":"We walked down the stairs instead of taking the elevator. The carpet on the stairs was worn. I had paid for the dinner when it came up and the waiter, who had brought it, was sitting on a chair near the door. He jumped up and bowed and I went with him into the side room and paid the bill for the room. The manager had remembered me as a friend and refused payment in advance but when he retired he had remembered to have the waiter stationed at the door so that I should not get out without paying. I suppose that had happened; even with his friends. One had so many friends in a war.\\n\\n I asked the waiter to get us a carriage and he took Catherine\u0027s package that I was carrying and went out with an umbrella. Outside through the window we saw him crossing the street in the rain. We stood in the side room and looked out the window.\\n\\n \"How do you feel, Cat?\"\\n\\n \"Sleepy.\"\\n\\n \"I feel hollow and hungry.\"\\n\\n \"Have you anything to eat?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, in my musette.\"\\n\\n I saw the carriage coming. It stopped, the horse\u0027s head hanging in the rain, and the waiter stepped out, opened his umbrella, and came toward the hotel. We met him at the door and walked out under the umbrella down the wet walk to the carriage at the curb. Water was running in the gutter.\\n\\n \"There is your package on the seat,\" the waiter said. He stood with the umbrella until we were in and I had tipped him.\\n\\n \"Many thanks. Pleasant journey,\" he said. The coachman lifted the reins and the horse started. The waiter turned away under the umbrella and went toward the hotel. We drove down the street and turned to the left, then came around to the right in front of the station. There were two carabinieri standing under the light just out of the rain. The light shone on their hats. The rain was clear and transparent against the light from the station. A porter came out from under the shelter of the station, his shoulders up against the rain.\\n\\n \"No,\" I said. \"Thanks. I don\u0027t need thee.\"\\n\\n He went back under the shelter of the archway. I turned to Catherine. Her face was in the shadow from the hood of the carriage.\\n\\n \"We might as well say good-by.\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t go in?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Good-by, Cat.\"\\n\\n \"Will you tell him the hospital?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n I told the driver the address to drive to. He nodded.\\n\\n \"Good-by,\" I said. \"Take good care of yourself and young Catherine.\"\\n\\n \"Good-by, darling.\"\\n\\n \"Good-by,\" I said. I stepped out into the rain and the carriage started. Catherine leaned out and I saw her face in the light. She smiled and waved. The carriage went up the street, Catherine pointed in toward the archway. I looked, there were only the two carabinieri and the archway. I realized she meant for me to get in out of the rain. I went in and stood and watched the carriage turn the corner. Then I started through the station and down the runway to the train.\\n\\n The porter was on the platform looking for me. I followed him into the train, crowding past people and along the aisle and in through a door to where the machine-gunner sat in the corner of a full compartment. My rucksack and musettes were above his head on the luggage rack. There were many men standing in the corridor and the men in the compartment all looked at us when we came in. There were not enough places in the train and every one was hostile. The machine-gunner stood up for me to sit down. Some one tapped me on the shoulder. I looked around. It was a very tall gaunt captain of artillery with a red scar along his jaw. He had looked through the glass on the corridor and then come in.\\n\\n \"What do you say?\" I asked. I had turned and faced him. He was taller than I and his face was very thin under the shadow of his cap-visor and the scar was new and shiny. Every one in the compartment was looking at me.\\n\\n \"You can\u0027t do that,\" he said. \"You can\u0027t have a soldier save you a place.\"\\n\\n \"I have done it.\"\\n\\n He swallowed and I saw his Adam\u0027s apple go up and then down. The machine-gunner stood in front of the place. Other men looked in through the glass. No one in the compartment said anything.\\n\\n \"You have no right to do that. I was here two hours before you came.\"\\n\\n \"What do you want?\"\\n\\n \"The seat.\"\\n\\n \"So do I.\"\\n\\n I watched his face and could feel the whole compartment against me. I did not blame them. He was in the right. But I wanted the seat. Still no one said anything.\\n\\n Oh, hell, I thought.\\n\\n \"Sit down, Signor Capitano,\" I said. The machine-gunner moved out of the way and the tall captain sat down. He looked at me. His face seemed hurt. But he had the seat. \"Get my things,\" I said to the machine-gunner. We went out in the corridor. The train was full and I knew there was no chance of a place. I gave the porter and the machine-gunner ten lire apiece. They went down the corridor and outside on the platform looking in the windows but there were no places.\\n\\n \"Maybe some will get off at Brescia,\" the porter said.\\n\\n \"More will get on at Brescia,\" said the machine-gunner. I said good-by to them and we shook hands and they left. They both felt badly. Inside the train we were all standing in the corridor when the train started. I watched the lights of the station and the yards as we went out. It was still raining and soon the windows were wet and you could not see out. Later I slept on the floor of the corridor; first putting my pocket-book with my money and papers in it inside my shirt and trousers so that it was inside the leg of my breeches. I slept all night, waking at Brescia and Verona when more men got on the train, but going back to sleep at once. I had my head on one of the musettes and my arms around the other and I could feel the pack and they could all walk over me if they wouldn\u0027t step on me. Men were sleeping on the floor all down the corridor. Others stood holding on to the window rods or leaning against the doors. That train was always crowded.\\n\\n \\n\\n 我们步行下楼，不乘电梯。楼梯上的地毯已经破烂了。晚餐送上来时我已经付了餐费，但那个端菜的侍者这时却守在大门边的椅子上。他跳起身来，鞠了个躬，我就跟着他走进一间小房间，付清了房钱。旅馆经理还记得我是他的朋友，拒绝我先付钱，不过他走时又记得打发一名侍者守在门口，防我不付帐就溜。我看这种事有过的；连经理的朋友都靠不住。战争时期朋友实在太多了。\\n\\n 我叫侍者去叫一部马车，他从我手里接过凯瑟琳的包裹，撑了一把雨伞走出去。我们从窗口看见他冒雨过街。我们站在那间小房间里望着窗外。\\n\\n “你觉得怎么样，凯瑟琳？”\\n\\n “想睡觉。”\\n\\n “我觉得空虚饥饿。”\\n\\n “吃的东西你有没有？”\\n\\n “有，在我的野战背包里。”\\n\\n 我看见马车来了。车子停下，马的头在雨中低垂着，侍者下了车，打开伞，走回旅馆来。我们在大门口迎上他，在雨伞下顺着给打湿的走道走，上了路石边的马车。水在明沟里流着。\\n\\n “你们的包裹在座位上，”侍者说。他打着雨伞站着，等待我们上了车付了小帐。\\n\\n “多谢多谢。一路愉快，”他说。赶车的一拉起缰，马就走了。撑着雨伞的侍者也就转身回旅馆。我们沿街赶车，向左转弯，然后再朝右拐，到了火车站前面。灯光下站着两名宪兵，站在雨刚刚打不到的地方。灯光映照着他们的帽子。在车站灯光下，雨丝清晰透明。有名搬行李工人从车站的拱廊下走出来，他拱着肩膀迎着雨。\\n\\n “不用，”我说。“谢谢，用不着你。”\\n\\n 他又回到拱廊下去躲雨。我转向凯瑟琳。她的脸在车盖的暗影中。“我们不如就在这里告别吧。”\\n\\n “我不能进去吗？”\\n\\n “不行。”\\n\\n “再会，凯特。”\\n\\n “你把医院的地址告诉他吧？”\\n\\n “好的。”\\n\\n 我把地址告诉了赶车的。他点点头。\\n\\n “再会，”我说。“保重自己和小凯瑟琳。”\\n\\n “再会，亲爱的。”\\n\\n “再会，”我说。我踏进雨中，车子走了。凯瑟琳探出头来，我看见她在灯光下的脸。她笑一笑，挥挥手。马车顺着街道驶去，凯瑟琳指指拱廊。我顺着她的手望去，只望见那两名宪兵和那拱廊。原来她要我走到里边去躲雨。我走了进去，站着观望马车转弯。随后我穿过车站，走下跑道去找火车。\\n\\n 医院的门房正在月台上等我。我跟着他上车，挤过人群，顺着车厢中的通道走，穿过一道门，看见那机枪手正坐在一个单间的一角，单间里坐满了人。我的背包和野战背包就摆在他头顶上的行李架上。通廊上站着许多人，我们进去时，单间中的人都看着我们。车里的座位不够，人人板起敌意的脸。\\n\\n 机枪手站起来让我坐。有人拍拍我的肩膀。我回头一看。原来是个瘦削而个子很高的炮兵上尉，下巴上有一条红色的伤疤。他刚才从通廊的玻璃窗外朝里看了看，然后才走进来。\\n\\n “你怎么说？”我问。我转身面对着他。他个子比我高，他的脸在帽舌的暗影下显得很瘦削，伤疤又新又亮。单间里的每个人都在望着我。“你这样不行呀，”他说。“你不可以叫个士兵替你占座位。”“我已经这么做了。”\\n\\n 他咽了一口口水，我看见他的喉结一上一下。机枪手站在座位前。通廊上的其他人从玻璃窗外望进来。单间里的人都没有说什么。“你没有这种权利。我比你早两个钟头就来了。”\\n\\n “那你要的是什么呢？”\\n\\n “座位。”\\n\\n “我也要。”\\n\\n 我注视着他的脸，感觉到单间里的人都反对我。我也不怪他们。他有理。但是我要座位。还是没人作声。\\n\\n 哼，真见鬼，我想道。\\n\\n “坐下吧，上尉先生，”我说。机枪手一让开身，高个子上尉便坐了下去。他望望我。他的脸好像挨了一下似的。不过他座位总算有了。“把我的东西拿下来。”我对机枪手说。我们走到通廊上。列车满了，我知道再也找不到座位了。我给医院门房和机枪手每人十里拉。他们沿着通廊走去，到了外边月台上，还朝各车窗内张望，但是找不到座位。“到了布里西亚或许有人下车，”门房说。\\n\\n “到了布里西亚上来的人更多，”机枪手说。我和他们告别，我们握握手，于是他们走了。他们俩都觉得怪不好意思。在车上，大家都站在通廊上，车子开了。列车开出站去，我看着车站的灯光和车场。外边还在下雨，不一会，玻璃窗湿了，外面的景物看不见了。后来我睡在通廊的地板上；睡前先把藏着金钱和证件的皮夹子塞在衬衫和裤子内，使它搁在马裤的裤腿内。我整夜睡觉，到了布里西亚和维罗那，都有更多的人上车，我醒一醒又睡着了。我的头枕着一只野战背包，双手抱着另一只，同时又摸得着我的背包，所以尽管让人家跨过我的身体，只要不踩着我。通廊地板上到处躺着人。有些人站着，扳住了窗上的铁杆子，或者靠在门上。这班车子总是拥挤的。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/288/2731.html","bookId":194,"book":{"id":194,"title":"永别了，武器 A Farewell To Arms","description":"简介： A Farewell to Arms is a semi-autobiographical novel written by Ernest Hemingway concerning events during the Italian campaigns during the First World War.
