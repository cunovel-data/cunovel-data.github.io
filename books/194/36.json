{"id":6086,"no":36,"title":"Chapter 36","content":"That night there was a storm and I woke to hear the rain lashing the window-panes. It was coming in the open window. Some one had knocked on the door. I went to the door very softly, not to disturb Catherine, and opened it. The barman stood there. He wore his overcoat and carried his wet hat. \"Can I speak to you, Tenente?\" \"What\u0027s the matter?\" \"It\u0027s a very serious matter.\" I looked around. The room was dark. I saw the water on the floor from the window. \"Come in,\" I said. I took him by the arm into the bathroom; locked the door and put on the light. I sat down on the edge of the bathtub. \"What\u0027s the matter, Emilio? Are you in trouble?\" \"No. You are, Tenente.\" \"Yes?\" \"They are going to arrest you in the morning.\" \"Yes?\" \"I came to tell you. I was out in the town and I heard them talking in a caf?\" \"I see.\" He stood there, his coat wet, holding his wet hat and said nothing. \"Why are they going to arrest me?\" \"For something about the war.\" \"Do you know what?\" \"No. But I know that they know you were here before as an officer and now you are here out of uniform. After this retreat they arrest everybody.\" I thought a minute. \"What time do they come to arrest me?\" \"In the morning. I don\u0027t know the time.\" \"What do you say to do?\" He put his hat in the washbowl. It was very wet and had been dripping on the floor. \"If you have nothing to fear an arrest is nothing. But it is always bad to be arrested--especially now.\" \"I don\u0027t want to be arrested.\" \"Then go to Switzerland.\" \"How?\" \"In my boat.\" \"There is a storm,\" I said. \"The storm is over. It is rough but you will be all right.\" \"When should we go?\" \"Right away. They might come to arrest you early in the morning.\" \"What about our bags?\" \"Get them packed. Get your lady dressed. I will take care of them.\" \"Where will you be?\" \"I will wait here. I don\u0027t want any one to see me outside in the hall.\" I opened the door, closed it, and went into the bedroom. Catherine was awake. \"What is it, darling?\" \"It\u0027s all right, Cat,\" I said. \"Would you like to get dressed right away and go in a boat to Switzerland?\" \"Would you?\" \"No,\" I said. \"I\u0027d like to go back to bed.\" \"What is it about?\" \"The barman says they are going to arrest me in the morning.\" \"Is the barman crazy?\" \"No.\" \"Then please hurry, darling, and get dressed so we can start.\" She sat up on the side of the bed. She was still sleepy. \"Is that the barman in the bathroom?\" \"Yes.\" \"Then I won\u0027t wash. Please look the other way, darling, and I\u0027ll be dressed in just a minute.\" I saw her white back as she took off her night-gown and then I looked away because she wanted me to. She was beginning to be a little big with the child and she did not want me to see her. I dressed hearing the rain on the windows. I did not have much to put in my bag. \"There\u0027s plenty of room in my bag, Cat, if you need any.\" \"I\u0027m almost packed,\" she said. \"Darling, I\u0027m awfully stupid, but why is the barman in the bathroom?\" \"Sh--he\u0027s waiting to take our bags down.\" \"He\u0027s awfully nice.\" \"He\u0027s an old friend,\" I said. \"I nearly sent him some pipetobacco once.\" I looked out the open window at the dark night. I could not see the lake, only the dark and the rain but the wind was quieter. \"I\u0027m ready, darling,\" Catherine said. \"All right.\" I went to the bathroom door. \"Here are the bags, Emilio,\" I said. The barman took the two bags. \"You\u0027re very good to help us,\" Catherine said. \"That\u0027s nothing, lady,\" the barman said. \"I\u0027m glad to help you just so I don\u0027t get in trouble myself. Listen,\" he said to me. \"I\u0027ll take these out the servants\u0027 stairs and to the boat. You just go out as though you were going for a walk.\" \"It\u0027s a lovely night for a walk,\" Catherine said. \"It\u0027s a bad night all right.\" \"I\u0027m glad I\u0027ve an umbrella,\" Catherine said. We walked down the hall and down the wide thickly carpeted stairs. At the foot of the stairs by the door the porter sat behind his desk. He looked surprised at seeing us. \"You\u0027re not going out, sir?\" he said. \"Yes,\" I said. \"We\u0027re going to see the storm along the lake.\" \"Haven\u0027t you got an umbrella, sir?\" \"No,\" I said. \"This coat sheds water.\" He looked at it doubtfully. \"I\u0027ll get you an umbrella, sir,\" he said. He went away and came back with a big umbrella. \"It is a little big, sir,\" he said. I gave him a ten-lira note. \"Oh you are too good, sir. Thank you very much,\" he said. He held the door open and we went out into the rain. He smiled at Catherine and she smiled at him. \"Don\u0027t stay out in the storm,\" he said. \"You will get wet, sir and lady.\" He was only the second porter, and his English was still literally translated. \"We\u0027ll be back,\" I said. We walked down the path under the giant umbrella and out through the dark wet gardens to the road and across the road to the trellised pathway along the lake. The wind was blowing offshore now. It was a cold, wet November wind and I knew it was snowing in the mountains. We came along past the chained boats in the slips along the quay to where the barman\u0027s boat should be. The water was dark against the stone. The barman stepped out from beside the row of trees. \"The bags are in the boat,\" he said. \"I want to pay you for the boat,\" I said. \"How much money have you?\" \"Not so much.\" \"You send me the money later. That will be all right.\" \"How much?\" \"What you want.\" \"Tell me how much.\" \"If you get through send me five hundred francs. You won\u0027t mind that if you get through.\" \"All right.\" \"Here are sandwiches.\" He handed me a package. \"Everything there was in the bar. It\u0027s all here. This is a bottle of brandy and a bottle of wine.\" I put them in my bag. \"Let me pay you for those.\" \"All right, give me fifty lire.\" I gave itto him. \"The brandy is good,\" he said. \"You don\u0027t need to be afraid to give itto your lady. She better get in the boat.\" He held the boat, it rising and falling against the stone wall and I helped Catherine in. She sat in the stern and pulled her cape around her. \"You know where to go?\" \"Up the lake.\" \"You know how far?\" \"Past Luino.\" \"Past Luino, Cannero, Cannobio, Tranzano. You aren\u0027t in Switzerland until you come to Brissago. You have to pass Monte Tamara.\" \"What time is it?\" Catherine asked. \"It\u0027s only eleven o\u0027clock,\" I said. \"If you row all the time you ought to be there by seven o\u0027clock in the morning.\" \"Is it that far?\" \"It\u0027s thirty-five kilometres.\" \"How should we go? In this rain we need a compass.\" \"No. Row to Isola Bella. Then on the other side of Isola Madre go with the wind. The wind will take you to Pallanza. You will see the lights. Then go up the shore.\" \"Maybe the wind will change.\" \"No,\" he said. \"This wind will blow like this for three days. It comes straight down from the Mattarone. There is a can to bail with.\" \"Let me pay you something for the boat now.\" \"No, I\u0027d rather take a chance. If you get through you pay me all you can.\" \"All right.\" \"I don\u0027t think you\u0027ll get drowned.\" \"That\u0027s good.\" \"Go with the wind up the lake.\" \"All right.\" I stepped in the boat. \"Did you leave the money for the hotel?\" \"Yes. In an envelope in the room.\" \"All right. Good luck, Tenente.\" \"Good luck. We thank you many times.\" \"You won\u0027t thank me if you get drowned.\" \"What does he say?\" Catherine asked. \"He says good luck.\" \"Good luck,\" Catherine said. \"Thank you very much.\" \"Are you ready?\" \"Yes.\" He bent down and shoved us off. I dug at the water with the oars, then waved one hand. The barman waved back deprecatingly. I saw the lights of the hotel and rowed out, rowing straight out until they were out of sight. There was quite a sea running but we were going with the wind. 当天夜里大风大雨，我被暴雨抽打玻璃窗的声响吵醒。雨从敞开的窗口打进来。有人在敲门。我悄悄地走到门边，不敢惊动凯瑟琳，把门打开。酒保站在外边。他披着大衣，手里拿着湿帽子。 “我可以跟你讲句话吗，中尉？” “什么事？” “很严重的事。” 我向四下张望了一下。房间里很暗。我看得见窗口地板上的积水。“进来，”我说。我搀住他的胳膊走进浴间，锁上了门，把灯开了。我坐在浴缸的边沿上。 “什么事，埃米利奥？你出了事吗？” “不。是你出事了，中尉。” “真的？” “他们明儿早上要来逮捕你。” “真的？” “我来通知你。我进了城，在一家咖啡店里听见他们在讲。”“原来是这样。” 他站在那儿，大衣湿淋淋的，手里拿着他那顶湿帽子，一声不响。“他们为什么要来逮捕我？” “关于战争中的什么事。” “你知道是什么事吗？” “不知道。我只知道他们知道你从前到这儿来是个军官，现在到这儿来没穿军服。这次撤退以后，他们什么人都逮捕。” 我考虑了一会儿。 “他们什么时候来逮捕我？” “早上。几点钟我不知道。” “你说我怎么办呢？” 他把帽子放在洗脸盆里。因为帽子很湿，一直在朝地板上滴水。“要是你当真没事，当然也不怕逮捕啦。但是被捕总是一件坏事——特别是现在。” “我不愿意被逮捕。” “那么到瑞士去。” “怎么去法呢？” “乘我的船。” “外边有暴风雨，”我说。 “暴风雨过去了。风浪是有的，不过你们不会有问题的。”“我们什么时候走呢？” “就走。他们也许一大清早就来抓人。” “我们的行李呢？” “那就收拾吧。你叫尊夫人穿好衣服。行李由我负责。”“你在哪儿等呢？” “就在这里等。外边走廊上我怕人家看见。” 我开了门，关好，走进卧房去。凯瑟琳已经醒了。 “什么事，亲爱的？” “没事，凯特，”我说。“你喜欢不喜欢立即穿好衣服，坐船到瑞士去？” “你喜欢吗？” “不喜欢，”我说。“我喜欢回到床上去。” “出了什么事？” “酒保说他们明天早晨要来抓我。” “他发疯了吗？” “没有发疯。” “那么请快穿好衣服，亲爱的，我们就走。”她在床边坐了起来。她还是睡意蒙眬的。“酒保在浴间里吧？” “是的。” “那我就不梳洗了。请你看另外一边，亲爱的，我一会儿就穿好衣服。” 她脱下睡衣时，我看见她那白皙的背部，我把头扭开去，因为她不要我看。她怀了孩子，肚子有点大，所以不要我看见。我边穿衣服，边听见窗户上的雨声。我并没有多少东西要装进我那小提包。 “我箱子里有好多空地方，凯特，如果你需要的话。” “我差不多收拾好了，”她说。“亲爱的，我很笨，可就是不懂酒保为什么要呆在浴间里？” “嘘——他在等着把我们的行李提下去。” “他这人真好。” “他是个老朋友，”我说。“我有一次差一点寄点板烟丝给他。”我从敞开的窗子望望外边的黑夜。我看不见湖，只有黑暗和雨，风倒比较安静下来了。 “我准备好了，亲爱的，”凯瑟琳说。 “好。”我走到浴间的门边。“行李在这儿，埃米利奥，”我说。酒保接过两只小提包。 “谢谢你帮我们忙，”凯瑟琳说。 “这不算什么，夫人，”酒保说。“我很愿意帮忙，只要我自己不惹出事来。喂，”他转对我说。“我提着这些东西走用人的楼梯，送到船上去。你们从前边出去，装做出去散步的模样。” “要散步这倒是个可爱的夜晚，”凯瑟琳说。 “的确是个糟透的夜晚。” “幸亏我还有一把伞，”凯瑟琳说。 我们走到门廊另一端，从铺着厚地毯的宽楼梯上走下去。楼梯底大门边，有个门房正坐在他的桌子后面。他见到我们，露出惊奇的模样。 “你们不是想出去吧，先生？”他说。 “出去溜溜，”我说。“我们到湖边去欣赏暴风雨。” “你没有伞吗，先生？” “没有，”我说。“这大衣可以挡雨。” 他怀疑地打量我的大衣。“我给你拿把伞来吧，先生，”他说。他去了回来，带来一把大伞。“稍为大一点，先生，”他说。我给他一张十里拉的钞票。“哦，你太好了，先生。多谢多谢，”他说。他拉开大门，我们走到雨里去。他对凯瑟琳笑笑，她也对他笑笑。“别在暴风雨中多耽搁，”他说。“你们会给淋湿的，先生和太太。”他只是门房的副手，他讲的英语是从意大利语逐字翻译出来的。 “我们就回来，”我说。我们撑着那把大伞走下小径，穿过又暗又湿的花园，跨过一条路，走进湖边搭有棚架的小径。风现在由岸上朝湖面刮。这是十一月中的又冷又湿的风，我知道高山上一定在下雪。我们沿着码头走，经过一些用铁链系住的小船，到了酒保的船该在的地方。石码头下边，湖水显得一片漆黑。酒保从一排树边闪了出来。 “行李在船里，”他说。 “我把船的钱给你吧，”我说。 “你身边有多少钱？” “不太多。” “那么你以后寄来好啦。没关系。” “多少钱？” “随你便。” “告诉我多少钱。” “你平安到达那边的话，寄五百法郎给我吧。你平安到了那边，就不会觉到太贵了。”“好吧。” “这是三明治。”他递一个小包给我。“酒吧间里所有的我都拿来了。都在这儿。这是一瓶白兰地和一瓶葡萄酒。”我把这些东西放在我的小提包里。“这些东西我现在付账吧。” “好，给我五十里拉吧。” 我给了他。“白兰地是好的，”他说。“尽管可以放心给尊夫人喝。她还是上船去吧。”船一高一低地撞着石壁，他用手拉住船，我扶凯瑟琳上了船。她坐在船尾，把身上的披肩裹紧。 “去的地方你知道吗？” “到湖的北边去。” “你知道多远吗？” “要过卢易诺①。”“要过卢易诺、坎纳罗、坎诺比奥、特兰萨诺。你得到了勃里萨哥才算进入瑞士国境。你得穿过塔玛拉山。” “现在什么时候？”凯瑟琳问。 “还只十一点，”我说。 “倘若你不停地划，早上七点钟应当可以到达那边了。” “有这么远吗？” “三十五公里。” “我们怎么走呢？下这样的雨，我们非有罗盘针不可。” “用不着。你先把船划到美人岛。随后到圣母岛的另一边，就可以顺着风走了。风会带你到巴兰萨②。你会看见岸上的灯光。然后挨着岸朝北走。” “也许风会转向的。” “不会，”他说。“这风将这样连刮三天。是从马特龙峰①直接刮下来的。船上有只罐子可以舀水。” ①亨利·巴比塞（1873—1935）参加第一次世界大战时，在战壕中写成本书，揭露战争的罪恶。该书于1916 年出版。 ② 这是英国作家威尔斯发表于1916 年的优秀反战小说。 ① 卢易诺是马焦莱湖畔的工业城镇。 “我现在付一点船钱给你吧。”“不，我还是冒个险吧。倘若你平安到了那边，你就照你的能力付给我好了。” “好的。” “依我看，你们不至于淹死的。” “这倒是个安慰。” “顺着风从湖上朝北走。” “好的。”我跨进船去。 “旅馆的房钱你留下没有？” “留下了。放在房中的一只信封里。” “好吧。祝你运气好，中尉。” “祝你运气好。我们俩多多感谢你。” “如果淹死就不会谢我了。” “他说什么？”凯瑟琳问。 “他说运气好。” “好运气，”凯瑟琳说。“非常感谢你。” “你们准备好了没有？” “好了。” 他弯下身把船推离岸边。我把双桨往水里一划，随即抬起一只手来招招。酒保摇摇手表示不赞许。我看见旅馆的灯光，赶快把船直划出去，直到灯光看不见了。湖上波涛汹涌，不过我们正是顺风。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/288/2743.html","bookId":194,"book":{"id":194,"title":"永别了，武器 A Farewell To Arms","description":"简介： A Farewell to Arms is a semi-autobiographical novel written by Ernest Hemingway concerning events during the Italian campaigns during the First World War.
