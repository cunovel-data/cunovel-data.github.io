{"id":6070,"no":20,"title":"Chapter 20","content":"One day in the afternoon we went to the races. Ferguson went too and Crowell Rodgers, the boy who had been wounded in the eyes by the explosion of the shell nose-cap. The girls dressed to go after lunch while Crowell and I sat on the bed in his room and read the past performances of the horses and the predictions in the racing paper. Crowell\u0027s head was bandaged and he did not care much about these races but read the racing paper constantly and kept track of all the horses for something to do. He said the horses were a terrible lot but they were all the horses we had. Old Meyers liked him and gave him tips. Meyers won on nearly every race but disliked to give tips because it brought down the prices. The racing was very crooked. Men who had been ruled off the turf everywhere else were racing in Italy. Meyers\u0027 information was good but I hated to ask him because sometimes he did not answer, and always you could see it hurt him to tell you, but he felt obligated to tell us for some reason and he hated less to tell Crowell. Crowell\u0027s eyes had been hurt, one was hurt badly, and Meyers had trouble with his eyes and so he liked Crowell. Meyers never told his wife what horses he was playing and she won or lost, mostly lost, and talked all the time.\\n\\n We four drove out to San Siro in an open carriage. It was a lovely day and we drove out through the park and out along the tramway and out of town where the road was dusty. There were villas with iron fences and big overgrown gardens and ditches with water flowing and green vegetable gardens with dust on the leaves. We could look across the plain and see farmhouses and the rich green farms with their irrigation ditches and the mountains to the north. There were many carriages going into the race track and the men at the gate let us in without cards because we were in uniform. We left the carriage, bought programmes, and walked across the infield and then across the smooth thick turf of the course to the paddock. The grand-stands were old and made of wood and the betting booths were under the stands and in a row out near the stables. There was a crowd of soldiers along the fence in the infield. The paddock was fairly well filled with people and they were walking the horses around in a ring under the trees behind the grandstand. We saw people we knew and got chairs for Ferguson and Catherine and watched the horses.\\n\\n They went around, one after the other, their heads down, the grooms leading them. One horse, a purplish black, Crowell swore was dyed that color. We watched him and it seemed possible. He had only come out just before the bell rang to saddle. We looked him up in the programme from the number on the groom\u0027s arm and it was listed a black gelding named Japalac. The race was for horses that had never won a race worth one thousand lire or more. Catherine was sure his color had been changed. Ferguson said she could not tell. I thought he looked suspicious. We all agreed we ought to back him and pooled one hundred lire. The odds sheets showed he would pay thirty-five to one. Crowell went over and bought the tickets while we watched the jockeys ride around once more and then go out under the trees to the track and gallop slowly up to the turn where the start was to be.\\n\\n We went up in the grand-stand to watch the race. They had no elastic barrier at San Siro then and the starter lined up all the horses, they looked very small way up the track, and then sent them off with a crack of his long whip. They came past us with the black horse well in front and on the turn he was running away from the others. I watched them on the far side with the glasses and saw the jockey fighting to hold him in but he could not hold him and when they came around the turn and into the stretch the black horse was fifteen lengths ahead of the others. He went way on up and around the turn after the finish.\\n\\n \"Isn\u0027t it wonderful,\" Catherine said. \"We\u0027ll have over three thousand lire. He must be a splendid horse.\"\\n\\n \"I hope his color doesn\u0027t run,\" Crowell said, \"before they pay off.\"\\n\\n \"He was really a lovely horse,\" Catherine said. \"I wonder if Mr. Meyers backed him.\"\\n\\n \"Did you have the winner?\" I called to Meyers. He nodded.\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t,\" Mrs. Meyers said. \"Who did you children bet on?\"\\n\\n \"Japalac.\"\\n\\n \"Really? He\u0027s thirty-five to one!\"\\n\\n \"We liked his color.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t. I thought he looked seedy. They told me not to back him.\"\\n\\n \"He won\u0027t pay much,\" Meyers said.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s marked thirty-five to one in the quotes,\" I said.\\n\\n \"He won\u0027t pay much. At the last minute,\" Meyers said, \"they put a lot of money on him.\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Kempton and the boys. You\u0027ll see. He won\u0027t pay two to one.\"\\n\\n \"Then we won\u0027t get three thousand lire,\" Catherine said. \"I don\u0027t like this crooked racing!\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll get two hundred lire.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s nothing. That doesn\u0027t do us any good. I thought we were going to get three thousand.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s crooked and disgusting,\" Ferguson said.\\n\\n \"Of course,\" said Catherine, \"if it hadn\u0027t been crooked we\u0027d never have backed him at all. But I would have liked the three thousand lire.\"\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s go down and get a drink and see what they pay,\" Crowell said. We went out to where they posted the numbers and the bell rang to pay off and they put up 18.50 after Japalac to win. That meant he paid less than even money on a ten-lira bet.\\n\\n We went to the bar under the grand-stand and had a whiskey and soda apiece. We ran into a couple of Italians we knew and McAdams, the vice-consul, and they came up with us when we joined the girls. The Italians were full of manners and McAdams talked to Catherine while we went down to bet again. Mr. Meyers was standing near the pari-mutuel.\\n\\n \"Ask him what he played,\" I said to Crowell.\\n\\n \"What are you on, Mr. Meyers?\" Crowell asked. Meyers took out his programme and pointed to the number five with his pencil.\\n\\n \"Do you mind if we play him too?\" Crowell asked.\\n\\n \"Go ahead. Go ahead. But don\u0027t tell my wife I gave it to you.\"\\n\\n \"Will you have a drink?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"No thanks. I never drink.\"\\n\\n We put a hundred lire on number five to win and a hundred to place and then had another whiskey and soda apiece. I was feeling very good and we picked up a couple more Italians, who each had a drink with us, and went back to the girls. These Italians were also very mannered and matched manners with the two we had collected before. In a little while no one could sit down. I gave the tickets to Catherine.\\n\\n \"What horse is it?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. Mr. Meyers\u0027 choice.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you even know the name?\"\\n\\n \"No. You can find it on the programme. Number five I think.\"\\n\\n \"You have touching faith,\" she said. The number five won but did not pay anything. Mr. Meyers was angry.\\n\\n \"You have to put up two hundred lire to make twenty,\" he said. \"Twelve lire for ten. It\u0027s not worth it. My wife lost twenty lire.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll go down with you,\" Catherine said to me. The Italians all stood up. We went downstairs and out to the paddock.\\n\\n \"Do you like this?\" Catherine asked.\\n\\n \"Yes. I guess I do.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s all right, I suppose,\" she said. \"But, darling, I can\u0027t stand to see so many people.\"\\n\\n \"We don\u0027t see many.\"\\n\\n \"No. But those Meyers and the man from the bank with his wife and daughters--\"\\n\\n \"He cashes my sight drafts,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Yes but some one else would if he didn\u0027t. Those last four boys were awful.\"\\n\\n \"We can stay out here and watch the race from the fence.\"\\n\\n \"That will be lovely. And, darling, let\u0027s back a horse we\u0027ve never heard of and that Mr. Meyers won\u0027t be backing.\"\\n\\n \"All right.\"\\n\\n We backed a horse named Light For Me that finished fourth in a field of five. We leaned on the fence and watched the horses go by, their hoofs thudding as they went past, and saw the mountains off in the distance and Milan beyond the trees and the fields.\\n\\n \"I feel so much cleaner,\" Catherine said. The horses were coming back, through the gate, wet and sweating, the jockeys quieting them and riding up to dismount under the trees.\\n\\n \"Wouldn\u0027t you like a drink? We could have one out here and see the horses.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll get them,\" I said.\\n\\n \"The boy will bring them,\" Catherine said. She put her hand up and the boy came out from the Pagoda bar beside the stables. We sat down at a round iron table.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you like it better when we\u0027re alone?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" I said.\\n\\n \"I felt very lonely when they were all there.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s grand here,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Yes. It\u0027s really a pretty course.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s nice.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t let me spoil your fun, darling. I\u0027ll go back whenever you want.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" I said. \"We\u0027ll stay here and have our drink. Then we\u0027ll go down and stand at the water jump for the steeplechase.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re awfully good to me,\" she said.\\n\\n After we had been alone awhile we were glad to see the others again. We had a good time.\\n\\n \\n\\n 有一天下午，我们到跑马场去。弗格逊也去，还有克罗威·罗吉斯，就是那个给炮弹雷管炸伤眼睛的青年。中饭后，姑娘们去打扮换衣服，克罗威和我则坐在他病房的床沿上，翻阅赛马报纸，研究各匹马过去的成绩和今天的预测。克罗威的头还扎着绷带，他本不关心赛马，只是因为闲来无事，才经常阅读赛马报纸，注意每匹马的进展变化。他说今天的马都不好，但是我们只有这些马可赌赛。老迈耶斯喜欢他，常常透露给他一些内部消息。迈耶斯每次看赛马，几乎每赌必胜，不过他不愿意把内部消息告诉人家，因为买那匹马票子的人一多，彩金就往下跌了。这里的赛马非常腐败。各国因跑马犯规而被赛马场开除的骑师，在意大利仍旧在当。迈耶斯的情报相当好，但是我不喜欢请教他，因为有时候你问他，他常常不回答，你看得出他告诉你时，总显得很为难，但是因为某种原因，他总觉得有义务告诉我们一些，特别是克罗威，他对他透露消息比较不太难过。克罗威的两只眼睛都受了伤，有一只是重伤，而迈耶斯自己眼睛也有毛病，所以他喜欢克罗威。迈耶斯赌什么马，从来不告诉他妻子。他妻子有时赢有时输，大多是输，话可唠唠叨叨个没完。\\n\\n 我们四人赶一部敞篷马车到圣西罗去。那天天气很好，我们赶着马车穿过公园，沿着电车轨道出城，一到城外，路上全是尘土。城外有些别墅，围着铁栅，有花草蔓生的大花园、有流着水的沟渠和青翠的菜园，菜叶上积有尘土。我们越过平原，望得见农民的屋子、丰腴青翠的田地和农场的水沟，还有北边的高山峻岭。往跑马场赶的马车很多，守大门的人让我们进去，并不查验入场证，因为我们身穿军装。我们下了马车，买了节目表，穿过内场，跨过那铺得又平又厚的跑马道，来到停马的围场。大看台已经陈旧了，是用木头搭成的，卖马票处就设在看台底下，在马房边排成一长列。有一群士兵靠着内场的围栏边。围场上的人也相当多，在大看台后边的树木底下，有人拉着马绕着圈子走，让马活动活动。我们见到一些熟人，弄到两把椅子给弗格逊和凯瑟琳坐，观察那些马。\\n\\n 马由马夫牵着走，一匹跟着一匹，马头垂下。有一匹紫黑色的马，克罗威发誓说那是染出来的颜色。我们仔细看了一下，觉得颜色可能是染上去的。这匹马在上鞍铃摇了以后，才给拉出来。我们看那马夫胳臂上的号数，对照节目表才知道这匹马叫做贾巴拉克，是一匹阉过的黑马。这一次竞赛的马，都是没有赢过一千里拉或更多的。凯瑟琳也说那匹马的颜色是假的。弗格逊说她没有把握。我则以为那马有点可疑。我们都同意购买这匹马的票子，一共凑了一百里拉。根据赌注打赌表，这匹马倘若跑赢的话，每里拉要付三十五里拉。克罗威走过去买马票，我们则看着骑师骑着马又绕了一个圈子，然后从树木底下走上跑道，慢慢地跑往起点。我们走上大看台去看赛马。圣西罗当年还没装上弹性起跑栅，那个主持起跑者先叫马排成一横行——在远远的跑道上这些马看起来很小——然后把长鞭啪的一挥，命令各匹马起跑。马跑过我们跟前时，那匹黑马竟然一马当先，到了转弯的地方，它撇下了其余的马，跑到远远的前方去了。我用望远镜往远处望去，看见黑马的骑师正在死命拉住它，但是马控制不住，等到拐弯转入最后决胜的那段跑道时，它抛下其余的马，有十五匹马马身长度的距离。黑马到了终点后还转了一个弯才停下来。“这太好了，”凯瑟琳说。“我们赢了三千多里拉啦。一定是匹好马。”“我只盼望他们付钱以前，马的颜色可别掉了，”克罗威说。“真是一匹可爱的马，”凯瑟琳说。“不晓得迈耶斯先生买了它的票没有。”“你买了那匹赢的马没有？”我大声问迈耶斯。他点点头。“我倒没有，”\\n\\n 迈耶斯太太说。“孩子们，你们押的是哪匹马？”“贾巴拉克。”\\n\\n “真的？赌注是三十五对一啊！”\\n\\n “我们喜欢它的颜色。”\\n\\n “我不喜欢。我看它样子不大对头。人家叫我不要押它。”“它不会付多少钱的，”迈耶斯说。\\n\\n “牌价上明明写着三十五对一啊，”我说。\\n\\n “不会付多少钱的。快起赛的时候，”迈耶斯说，“有人押下了一大笔款子。”\\n\\n “谁？”\\n\\n “肯普顿和他那一帮人。你等着瞧吧。这匹马付不到二对一。”“那么我们得不到三千里拉了，”凯瑟琳说。“我可不喜欢这种作弊的赛马。”\\n\\n “我们可以得到二百里拉。”\\n\\n “那算不了什么。那对我们有什么好处？我还以为我们快要得到三千里拉哩。”\\n\\n “这样腐败，惹人厌恶，”弗格逊说。\\n\\n “自然咯，”凯瑟琳说，“我们可不就是因为它形迹可疑才押它的。不过，我倒真想得到三千里拉呢。”\\n\\n “我们下去喝杯酒，看他们付多少钱，”克罗威说。我们到了人家张贴号码并摇铃付款的地方，在贾巴拉克名字后写着每十里拉可得十八个半里拉。这就是说，甚至不到二比一。\\n\\n 我们走进大看台下的酒吧间，每人喝了一杯威士忌苏打。我们碰到两个认识的意大利人和副领事麦克亚当斯，他们跟着我们上去找女士们。意大利人彬彬有礼，麦克亚当斯和凯瑟琳谈话，我们则又下去押马。迈耶斯正站在派彩处①附近。\\n\\n “问他赌哪匹马，”我对克罗威说。\\n\\n “你赌哪匹马，迈耶斯先生？”克罗威问。迈耶斯拿出节目表来，用铅笔指指第五号。\\n\\n “我们也买它，行吗？”克罗威问。\\n\\n “尽管买。尽管买。可别告诉我妻子是我告诉你们的。”\\n\\n “喝杯酒吧？”我问。\\n\\n “不，谢谢。我从来不喝酒。”\\n\\n 我们用一百里拉赌第五号马跑头马，又花一百里拉赌它跑二马，随后又是一人一杯威士忌苏打。我觉得很高兴，又结交了两个意大利人，他们每人陪我们喝了一杯酒后，我们就去找女士们。这两个意大利人也很彬彬有礼，跟先前那两个一模一样。过了一会儿，就没人坐得下来了。我把马票递给凯瑟琳。\\n\\n “买了哪匹马？”\\n\\n ① 这种跑马赛，一般在每场截止购马票后，由场方把每匹马上的全部押金，扣去一定比例的手续费，再用计算器算出如果跑出名次后每张马票能分到多少，在派彩处公布。\\n\\n “我不知道。是迈耶斯先生选择的。”\\n\\n “你连马的名字都不知道吗？”\\n\\n “不知道。你往节目表上去找吧。大概是第五号。”\\n\\n “你的信心真动人，”她说。第五号马果然赢了，但是付的钱很有限。迈耶斯先生很光火。“你得花二百里拉才能赢到二十里拉，”他说。“十里拉的马票得十二里拉。太不值得了。内人就输了二十里拉。”\\n\\n “我跟你下去走走，”凯瑟琳对我说。意大利人都站起身。我们走下大看台，往停马的围场走去。\\n\\n “这赛马你喜欢吗？”凯瑟琳问。\\n\\n “是的。我想是喜欢的。”\\n\\n “依我看，这也不错，”她说。“不过，亲爱的，见那么多的人我可受不了。”\\n\\n “我们也没见多少人啊。”\\n\\n “人是不多。不过迈耶斯夫妇，还有那个银行主任和他的妻子和女儿们——”\\n\\n “我的即期支票是他兑给我的，”我说。\\n\\n “不错，不过他不兑的话，别人也肯兑给你的。那最后四个小伙子更叫人难受。”\\n\\n “我们就呆在这里看跑马好了，就从围栏这儿看。”\\n\\n “那好极了。还有，亲爱的，我们来赌一匹从来没听见过的马，一匹迈耶斯先生不会押的马。”\\n\\n “好的。”\\n\\n 我们押了一匹名叫“给我点燃”的马，结果跑时一共五匹，我们这匹马跑第四。我们靠在围栏上，看着马跑过，一片马蹄哒哒声，还望见了遥远的山峰以及在树木和田野后边的米兰城。\\n\\n “我觉得清爽多了，”凯瑟琳说。马儿回来了，由大门走过，又湿又流汗，骑师们在叫马儿安静下来，把马带到树底下，预备下马。“你不想喝杯酒吗？我们可以在这儿喝酒赏马。”\\n\\n “我去拿，”我说。\\n\\n “小伙计会送来的，”凯瑟琳说。她伸手一挥，马房旁边那个卖酒凉亭上就有个小伙计跑出来。我们在一张圆铁桌边坐下了。\\n\\n “你是不是觉得我们俩单独在一起更好些？”\\n\\n “是的，”我说。\\n\\n “跟他们在一起的时候，我觉得好孤单寂寞。”\\n\\n “这儿好得很，”我说。\\n\\n “是的。这赛马场果真好看。”\\n\\n “是不错的。”\\n\\n “你别给我弄得扫兴，亲爱的。你什么时候想回去我就回去。”\\n\\n “不，”我说。“我们就留在这儿喝酒吧。等一会儿，我们下去站在越水障碍边，看障碍赛马。”\\n\\n “你待我真好，”她说。\\n\\n 我们俩单独在一起一会儿后，倒又高兴去见旁的人们了。我们尽兴而归。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/288/2727.html","bookId":194,"book":{"id":194,"title":"永别了，武器 A Farewell To Arms","description":"简介： A Farewell to Arms is a semi-autobiographical novel written by Ernest Hemingway concerning events during the Italian campaigns during the First World War.
