{"id":103673,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"Chapter Twenty-five \"Oh, bloody hell.\" The seventh circle of hell. That\u0027s what Hugh looked like he\u0027d ventured into as more and more of her family filed out of the house and approached them. Belinda was here with her husband and children, and Sam and her family had arrived as well. She had to laugh evilly. \"Too late to run. You\u0027re snared, I\u0027m afraid.\" \"Aye, and you\u0027d best enjoy it,\" Hugh muttered. \"You go back to a locked cellar.\" \"Jane!\" Samantha cried again, her russet curls bouncing. \"What are you doing here?\" \"Aunty Jane!\" five children called as they besieged her, trampling her to the ground as she laughed. Belinda clapped her hands in delight. \"But you said you couldn\u0027t come this week!\" Then they noticed Hugh behind her, and everything went silent while jaws dropped. The children stared up at the towering Highlander in wonder. To break the awkward moment, Jane held up her hand, and as expected, Hugh shot forward to help her to her feet. \"What\u0027she doing here?\" Sam asked, never one to mince words. Hugh gave Jane an expression as if to say, \"Indeed.\" \"Well, he\u0027s...we\u0027re married.\" Sam\u0027s jovial husband, a physician named Robert Granger, murmured to Sam, \"Not four days ago, you told me she was marrying Bidworth.\" From the side of her mouth, Sam answered, \"That\u0027s because shewas .\" \"Well, obviouslythat did not happen,\" Jane said blithely. \"So wish us well and meet my new husband.\" Hugh knew her cousins - barely - so she introduced Hugh to Robert, and they shook hands. If Hugh\u0027s threatening look hadn\u0027t deterred him, Robert would likely have bear-hugged him a welcome into the family. Then she presented Hugh to Lawrence Thompson, Belinda\u0027s husband, a prankster and a considerable wit with a ready laugh, who cradled his hand after Hugh shook it. Seeing all of them lifted Jane\u0027s spirits and made her realize how much Hugh\u0027s awful words had hurt her.I\u0027ll still leave you. Hugh eyed everyone with such a leery demeanor, so noticeably out of his element, that she couldn\u0027t resist. She knew she had a diabolical gleam in her eyes when she faced Hugh and said, \"I absolutely must catch up with my cousins and show off my new ring. In private.\" He was subtly shaking his head. \"Hugh, why don\u0027t you get to knowthe other husbands - they like to drink scotch and sit on the lawn about this time of morning. Talk about the stock exchange and such.\" She hadn\u0027t missed his wary glance at the children either. \"Oh, and, children, your new uncle Hugh loves to buy presents and treats. You\u0027ve only to tell him what you want!\" \"Off of him now!\" Robert exclaimed as he shooed bairns off Hugh. \"Run along and play!\" Hugh wanted to fall down with relief when the last one made yet another request, released his leg, then scampered away. Jane really was going to do this - she truly was leaving him to deal with these men. She and her cousins had gathered up bottles of wine and strolled out on the dock without a backward glance. \"Don\u0027t know what Jane was thinking, to set the hounds to you like that!\" Robert flashed him a sheepish grin. \"But, finally, it\u0027s just men.\" He led them over to a set of wicker lawn chairs and, once seated, began pouring a round of drinks, though it was not nearly ten. \"So, what do you do, MacCarrick?\" Hugh reluctantly sat and accepted the glass, not knowing his way around this. \"I\u0027m...retired.\" He\u0027d never been forced to make conversation. Never spoke unless something needed to be said. In more than one way, he\u0027d been perfectly suited for his occupation. \"That\u0027s the way to do it, my boy!\" Robert raised his glass - then drained it. \"Retire, take a beautiful bride, and enjoy life.\" Lawrence worked on his drink more slowly, but not by much. \"Are you and Jane starting a family straight away?\" Hugh shrugged. After seeing her happiness when all those bairns waylaid her, he had never been more keenly aware that he could never give her children. Robert sank back with his second drink on his knee. \"We waited, Sam and I, nearly three years to start.\" Waited?So odd to hear these upper-class gentlemen speak of topics like this. \"Waited\" meant contraception. Robert and Lawrence then mused on how their wives had behaved and looked when pregnant (\"quite lusty\" and \"pleasingly plump\"), how children changed a man (\"didn\u0027t know what I was about before them\"), and other things Hugh tried his damnedest to block out. He kept glancing over at Jane and her cousins deep in conversation, knowing she was telling them everything about last night. Each time she closed in to whisper to the two women, he cringed, feeling his face flush violently. After a grueling hour of conversation Hugh barely heard, Lawrence suggested that the men target-shoot. Hugh ran his hand over the back of his neck, knowing he would have to miss. Though he had a powerful desire to impress Jane, to shoot as these people had never seen, he stifled it, aware how unwise it would be to demonstrate exactly what he excelled in. A quick glance told him that Jane had shaded her eyes with her hand to see. Would she remember that he could shoot? She used to tag along with him on hunts all the time, had tromped with him over every inch of woodlands in the area. Hugh recalled one of the first times Jane had accompanied him. Afterward, she\u0027d bragged to Weyland about Hugh\u0027s shooting: \"Papa, you wouldn\u0027t believe how he can shoot - so calm, and steady as a rock! He hit a duck at seventy yards at least in a stiff breeze.\" Weyland had eyed him with new interest. \"Did he, then?\" Hugh hadn\u0027t understood why at the time. He\u0027d had no way of knowing that Weyland was sizing him up for a lethal profession - one that had provided wealth to a second son who\u0027d had none, and laid out the path to walk with death.... Chapter Twenty-six \"So how is your Scot in bed? As good as you\u0027ve always dreamed?\" Sam asked. Jane rolled her eyes. Of course, the conversation had wended its way to this topic, and Sam was going to needle for details until the entire truth came out. So Jane related everything - well, almost everything. She told them of her stunned hurt over Lysette, and her subsequent relief when she\u0027d found out Hugh had been true to her. She admitted that they\u0027d been intimate last night but hadn\u0027t consummated the marriage, and she related their last conversation - or, more accurately, fight. She confided her suspicion that Hugh was a mercenary of some sort. Sam said, \"I can\u0027t imagine what Uncle Edward is up to, forcing you to marry MacCarrick.\" \"And Hugh being a mercenary?\" Belinda glanced in his direction. \"Does sort of fit.\" \"But, marriage of convenience or not, why haven\u0027t you rendered it veryinconvenient already?\" Sam asked. Jane surreptitiously rolled down her stockings, discarding them and her shoes to dip her feet in the water. \"Hugh doesn\u0027t want to be trapped and will do whatever it takes to get out of it. He\u0027s made that abundantly clear. I believe his words were, \u0027I will still leave you.\u0027\" Belinda had pre-opened the cork on the second wine bottle, but still couldn\u0027t get it open. She handed it to Sam and said, \"Jane, I can see why you wouldn\u0027t want to chance this, but I don\u0027t understand why he is so averse. Does he have a lover?\" \"No, he said he is \u0027between.\u0027\" Sam took out the cork with her teeth, then spat it into the lake. Recorking a bottle was something of a crime at Vinelands. \"Does he make any money as a mercenary?\" \"Father told me he had some. But then, Father also neglected to tell me his true occupation.\" Sam asked, \"So sure he\u0027s a mercenary?\" Jane nodded. \"His brother is. And Hugh was just down there on the Continent fighting with him. That\u0027s how he got those marks on his face.\" Sam handed Belinda the bottle. \"Which brother?\" \"Court. Courtland. Theangry one.\" After they both flashed expressions of recognition at that, Belinda said, \"At least he wasn\u0027t as bad as the oldest one.\" \"The one whose face was all cut up! He used to give me night terrors,\" Sam admitted. \"Oh, me too!\" Belinda said. \"One morning I was out berry-picking with Claudia, and we met him on a foggy lane. We froze, and he scowled as if he knew what was about to happen. When we dropped our baskets and ran, he roared curses at us.\" For some reason, Jane felt a brief flare of pity for Ethan. He would have been only twenty or so. \"Later we felt awful. Silly.\" Almost as an afterthought, Belinda muttered, \"But we didn\u0027t go back for our baskets.\" \"So what the devil is MacCarrick\u0027s hesitation?\" Sam frowned. \"He\u0027s got enough money to support you, he doesn\u0027t have a woman, and he\u0027s completely lost for you.\" Jane gave Sam an unamused expression, then turned so Hugh couldn\u0027t see her take a gulp of wine. After his rant this morning, Jane figured he\u0027d be displeased to find even a temporary wife stockingless and passing around a bottle. \"He\u0027s so lost for me, he tells me twice daily how our marriage will end.\" Sam waved her comment away. \"I\u0027m merely saying what I see. It is a puzzle. I do so love puzzles.\" \"Maybe he\u0027s got a lusty Scottish lass waiting for him back in the clan,\" Belinda offered, taking a more ladylike taste of the wine. \"Someone with ample breasts and wide hips, someone who can cook.\" Jane\u0027s brows drew together. Suddenly, she found the idea of traveling to his clan\u0027s seat decidedly less appealing. Jane would be the outsider, not speaking the language, not understanding exchanges between Hugh and his kinsmen, or between him and any lasses he\u0027d left behind. Sam said, \"At least Jane has the lusty part down pat.\" Jane didn\u0027t bother contradicting that. Her cravings before had been an irritation, but now with Hugh - and after last night - they seemed to consume her. \"I swear\" - she leaned in as Sam\u0027s two daughters ran by the end of the dock, chased by a heaving nanny - \"I swear, sometimes I believe that I think about making love as much as a twenty-seven-year-old male. There are people obsessed with all things carnal. Maybe I\u0027m like them.\" Sam rolled her eyes. \"This, coming from the twenty-seven-year-old virgin.\" \"Samantha, you mustn\u0027t judge,\" Belinda chided in a prim tone. \"Jane never asked to be a virgin.\" She snapped her fingers for the bottle. \"So what happens if you don\u0027t consummate the marriage? What happens at the end of this adventure for you?\" Jane put her hands behind her and leaned back, inhaling deeply. The air was redolent with the scent of wild roses, not yet checked by the autumn\u0027s first frost. \"Our marriage is dissolved. Hugh goes back to mercenarying or marauding or whatever his secret endeavors are.\" Then Sam asked, \"Janey, just a thought. Doyou want to stay wed to him?\" Jane had wondered if Sam and Belinda were tiptoeing about Jane\u0027s past fixation on Hugh, focusing only on his motivations. They most likely feared Jane would cry over Hugh yet again. As she contemplated the question, she watched Hugh purposely miss yet another shot, even with Lawrence slapping his back and elbowing him. Hugh could have embarrassed the two men, but he hadn\u0027t. And she\u0027d seen him eyeing the way Robert held his rifle and knew he badly wanted to correct it, but he\u0027d said nothing. He really was trying to rub along with her odd family. Jane sighed. After their encounter the night before, she knew she could spend the rest of her nights with that man. Even after their row today, she knew he\u0027d make a good husband. At an early age she\u0027d discovered his personality and temperament were devastatingly attractive to her. She\u0027d set her cap at him, and after he\u0027d left, she\u0027d never met his equal. She gave them a tight smile. \"Doesn\u0027t matter, does it? He couldn\u0027t have made it more clear that as soon as this is over, he will leave and not come back. I swear, you should have seen the look on his face when I told him I hadn\u0027t been celibate.\" \"To be fair,\" Belinda began, \"an easy annulment was one of the terms of the deal he agreed to. Without it, this could get tricky. He might even fear you\u0027ll have to divorce. Which cousin Charlotte can tell you is nasty business, after all the hours she\u0027s spent at the courthouse.\" Sam was shaking her head. \"No, he\u0027s jealous. He reacted to the thought of you with another man, or men.\" Belinda covered her mouth with three fingertips, stifling a hiccup, then snapped her fingers for the bottle again - this time from Jane. \"Jane, I\u0027m actually going to have to agree with Sam on this one. He does look at you like he\u0027s been starved and you\u0027re a feast.\" \"You\u0027ve only seen us together for the shortest time!\" Sam said, \"But he keeps looking over here at you. Watch for it now. Give it five seconds. Five, four, three - \" Jane tugged one of Sam\u0027s russet curls, but Hugh did, in fact, turn to look at her two seconds later. \"He might appear a bit possessive,\" she allowed. \"But he should. He\u0027s protecting me.\" \"Come on, haven\u0027t you ever seen a Highlander madly in love? No?\" Sam jerked her thumb over her shoulder toward Hugh who was staring at Jane with a smoldering expression. \"Behold!\" \"Madly in love. That\u0027s ridiculous.\" Yet her heart had started knocking hard in her chest. Belinda frowned. \"Jane, where\u0027s your famed confidence?\" \"Embattled. Running screaming for the hills. Which happens when one\u0027s husband regards his marriage as a sprung bear trap. When he appears determined to gnaw off a paw to escape, well, that never helps, either.\" \"Maybe he doesn\u0027t think he\u0027s rich enough or good enough for you,\" Belinda said. \"After all, you were about to marry an exceedingly handsome and wealthy earl.\" \"She\u0027s right,\" Sam said. \"This smacks of self-sacrifice to me.\" \"So you think he\u0027s here, ready to risk his life for me, because he\u0027s in love with me and couldn\u0027t stand to see me hurt?\" Belinda nodded. \"Why, that\u0027s it, precisely.\" Whywas Hugh doing all this? Yes, she knew he owed her father for his livelihood. But surely this was above and beyond repayment. \"Any ideas on why he\u0027d leave before and be furiously resolved against marrying me now?\" \"No, but in your place, I\u0027d be finding out,\" Sam said. \"And I\u0027d develop a strategy.\" \"A strategy for MacCarrick,\" Jane said, tapping her chin. \"Why do I have a sense of history repeating itself?\" Sam shrugged. \"True, our last plan wasn\u0027t utterly successful - \" \"Utterly successful?\" Jane asked with a laugh. \"We endeavored to get him to marry me, and instead, he disappeared for a decade.\" \"Well, then, what are you going to do?\" Belinda asked. Brows drawn, Jane said, \"Wait until an answer comes to me from nowhere, then act impulsively and inappropriately?\" Sam rubbed her chin thoughtfully. \"It might just work.\" Chapter Twenty-seven Toward sundown, Hugh caught her just as she was leaving the house through a side door. \"You canna avoid me all day.\" He eased her against the wall, and she let him. \"I stayed within your eyesight,\" she said, surprised when he rested a hand beside her head and leaned over her. \"Besides, I thought you were enjoying spending time with Robert and Lawrence.\" He narrowed his eyes. \"Oh, aye. Today, I\u0027ve shot, fished, and smoked, and because I\u0027ve had to keep my eye on you throughout it all, they\u0027ve ribbed me without cease for being \u0027wrapped \u0027round the old finger.\u0027\" He sounded so gruff, she almost smiled. \"Did you tell your cousins about last night?\" \"Of course I did.\" \"You told them how I...how we...\" He trailed off with a groan, bending down to rest his forehead against hers. \"Jane, you dinna.\" \"Have you been worried about this all day?\" He pulled back his head. \"Christ, yes.\" She studied her nails. \"Well, you deserved to agonize over it, after how hurtful you were this morning.\" \"Likely, but I doona want our private business bandied about by your cousins. After one day\u0027s post run, all seven will know.\" \"I did tell Sam and Belinda, but I didn\u0027t give details. I merely told them we\u0027ve been...intimate but haven\u0027t, well, made love.\" \"That\u0027s too much still,\" he said, but he relaxed a fraction, leaning in again. \"I dinna think you would voluntarily speak to me after this morning.\" \"I\u0027m going to make myself forget what you said.\" \"I\u0027d appreciate that - \" \"If you make a deal with me. Every time you brood over the next two weeks, you have to give me a hundred pounds.\" \"A hundred? Why do you want this?\" \"I\u0027ve realized today that just because we\u0027re forced to spend this time together, it doesn\u0027t have to be miserable. I want to enjoy myself - with you - and it\u0027s impossible when you\u0027re mired in thoughts of something else.\" \"I canna just change myself - \" \"Make the deal, Hugh, or Iwon\u0027t forget what you said this morning, and Iwill divulge everything to my cousins, right down to the exact words you were saying when you were above me.\" He looked away, jaw clenched so hard that she thought he could chew metal, and gritted out, \"I\u0027ll make the deal.\" \"Good. But be warned, those pounds will add up rapidly.\" \"I think I can handle it.\" \"The expense or the not brooding?\" He was saved from answering when Sam\u0027s daughter Emily appeared. \"Come on, Aunt Janey,\" the girl cried, grabbing Jane\u0027s hand and pulling her toward the lawn. Jane caught Hugh\u0027s hand, and over her shoulder, she explained, \"Emily\u0027s like I was when I was little - running wild all day until I dropped where I stood.\" \"When you were little?\" Hugh raised his brows. \"You were still like that at thirteen.\" She chuckled, which seemed to surprise him. When they reached a blanket on the lawn, Jane sat and tugged Hugh\u0027s hand until he dropped down beside her. Emily crawled into her lap. \"Aunt Janey,\" Emily whispered loudly, \"is he the rough Scot you married?\" Jane saw his face grow cold immediately. \"He is.\" Emily eyed him suspiciously. \"Am I really to call him uncle, then?\" \"Um, yes, sweeting, he\u0027s your uncle Hugh.\" \"Is he really going to buy us presents?\" To Emily, she whispered loudly, \"You should ask him.\" Emily tilted her head. \"Are you going to get me the dollies I asked for?\" Hugh looked at Jane briefly before answering. \"Aye.\" \"You won\u0027t forget?\" When he shook his head, Emily flashed him one of the beatific smiles that, in the past, had gotten Jane to promise her - and deliver - a brown-spotted, white pony that Emily could name Freckles. Hugh merely gave Emily a nod, like a man greeting an acquaintance at a club. Before Emily scampered away, she said, \"Bye...Uncle Hugh.\" Jane frowned at him. \"You act like you\u0027ve never been around children before.\" \"I have no\u0027. No\u0027 in years.\" Then he tensed. \"What should I have done?\" He seemed to be waiting intently for her answer. Hugh tries....\"Well, you could have said, \u0027Yes, sweet, but only if you are good all week long,\u0027 or something along that line.\" He seemed to be filing that away. \"Dinna know you liked bairns so much.\" \"Ilove them,\" she said, glancing over at the children playing, getting grass stains all over themselves. \"I love everything about them. How their hair smells like sunshine at the end of the day, and how they feel everything so strongly and they\u0027re so quick to laugh....\" She trailed off at his darkening expression. \"Did I say something?\" \"Why have you no\u0027 gone about getting your own?\" he snapped. She drew back. \"Alas, there\u0027s an intermediary necessary for \u0027getting\u0027 them - he\u0027s called a husband.\" \"Seems like you should no\u0027 have been so stringent about your \u0027qualifications\u0027 for a husband, then.\" \"You make it sound like it\u0027s too late - I\u0027m only twenty-seven! My mother had me when she was twenty-nine. There is no reason for me to settle. Or therewas no reason to settle - oh, I\u0027m confused. I swear, it\u0027d be so much easier if I was either completely married or completely single.\" \"But right now, you\u0027re half-married to arough Scot ?\" he grated. That had really gotten to him. \"They don\u0027t mean anything by it.\" He looked away and plucked a piece of grass as he asked, \"Were you...were you shamed to have me here as your husband?\" \"Oh, heavens, no!\" she said, then wished she\u0027d been a little more poised - and a little less exclamatory - in her answer, even as his grim expression eased somewhat. She didn\u0027t care what her cousins said. She\u0027d always found Hugh\u0027s rugged looks handsome. He dressed simply but well, and he had good manners for all that he didn\u0027t talk much - and for all that his handshake was a \"bit excruciating,\" as Robert had told Sam, who\u0027d told Jane. \"Besides, rough Scot is a lot better than what they call Robert.\" When Hugh raised his eyebrows, she said, \"They call Robert the laughing quack. He thinks the two of you are fast friends, by the way. He told me he got a good sense about you, though he couldn\u0027t wrangle more than two words out of you. He\u0027s usually right about these things.\" \"Good sense, huh? Then why...?\" He never finished the question, as he\u0027d caught sight of Lawrence starting the bonfire. \"There\u0027s to be a fire?\" He eyed his surroundings warily. \"Here?\" She nodded. \"We eat supper out here whenever the weather\u0027s this nice.\" \"I ken that.\" His gaze was watchful as Belinda and Sam began setting out food and wine. \"We will stay, won\u0027t we?\" He swung a look at her as if she\u0027d just asked him to drink from the Thames. They intended to sit out here. All of them. Together. Oh, no, no. \"No, we canna stay.\" He rose, pulling her up with him. This, Hugh would not do. He and his brothers had been invited to attend those fireside dinners, but they\u0027d never accepted, all of them too uncomprehending of the strange behavior of this family. Men drank readily and smoked cigars in front of their wives, trilling laughter sounded throughout the night, children slept draped over their parents wherever they\u0027d fallen asleep, not waking even at the loud laughter. How many nights had the three brothers sat out on their terrace, listening, giving each other looks of bewilderment? Now he was to be on the other side of the cove, for the fire? He must have shown how dismayed he was, because she sidled up to him, a smile playing about her wine-reddened lips - the lips he\u0027d burned to sample when he\u0027d pressed her against the house just minutes ago. \"I\u0027d really like to eat here tonight,\" she said. He shook his head sternly. \"Please?\" she asked in a soft voice, making him wonder which was worse - that she could manage him, or that they both knew she could. She took his hand, easing them back down to the blanket. \"We\u0027ll just sit here.\" He knew she was manipulating him, but he was also aware she would clasp his arm and mold her body to his as they sat. Withstand the fire; get this attention. He would win this one. Leaning close, her breasts soft against his arm, she trailed her hand up to the back of his neck, then made slow, lazy circles with her nails. \"This is not so bad, is it?\" Not with her, but the others had all convened - from nannies to bairns to couples - all lazy on blankets around the fire, with delicacies spread about on china dishes. Though Jane prepared him a selection, and the food smelled delicious, he had no appetite. Once the children had dropped off - with the wee lass Emily bundled in a blanket and curled over Jane\u0027s ankles - and the nannies had retired, more bottles of wine surfaced. The talk grew lively and the language turned frank, even in front of the ladies, evenby the ladies. Hugh glanced up when he heard Robert say, \"At least Hugh knows what she\u0027s like. Imagine if he\u0027d married her without having known her for so long.\" Samantha said, \"Well, I\u0027m sure he knows that Janey\u0027s the wildest of the Eight.\" \"I am not!\" Jane cried. \"Does Hugh know about the Russian prince?\" Samantha asked, and Jane gave a self-satisfied smile. Hugh\u0027s no\u0027 sure he wants to know about the Russian prince.... But Samantha had already begun. \"Just this spring at a ball, a horrid old lecher of a prince stuck his hand down Charlotte\u0027s bodice. Little Charlotte was so mortified! So we all went on the offensive, spreading rumors about his eleventh toe of a male appendage.\" Samantha\u0027s eyes were glinting with amusement. \"But Jane merely watched from the side like a tigress sizing up prey, waiting for the right moment. I saw the whole thing happening. As he strolled past her, she flashed him a come-hither smile. His attention was so fixed on her that he never saw her foot sweep out from under her skirts to trip him. He crashed face first into the gala-size punch bowl.\" Hugh felt the corners of his lips quirking. Fierce lass. Belinda added, \"Jane sauntered up to us, brushing her hands off, and remarked\" - she mimicked Jane\u0027s sensual voice - \"\u0027Darlings, all men bow before the Weyland Eight. Or they fall.\u0027\" Hugh raised his eyebrows at Jane, and the words slipped out: \"They bow, do they?\" \"Weren\u0027t you listening?\" she asked with a saucy grin. \"That, or they fall. And the big ones like you fallhard .\" No bloody kidding. Everyone laughed. After that, the conversation devolved into a dirty limerick contest. When Hugh found himself on the verge of grinning, he grew guarded. He forced himself to draw back. That\u0027s what he did - he was always on the outside, looking in. Always. It wasn\u0027t difficult - he was so different from these people, it was like night and day. Everyone here was so bloody comfortable in their own skin, so settled and sure in their relationships, affection displayed openly, unconsciously. Samantha laughed with her lips pressed to Robert\u0027s neck. Belinda and Lawrence held hands to walk ten feet to go retrieve her shawl. What would it be like if he belonged here, if Jane truly were his? What wouldhe be like without the constant shadow of theLeabhar over him? How he envied this life. One family so blessed, one cursed. When he exhaled, Jane absently stroked the back of his neck with her nails, as though she sensed he needed it. He stared into the fire. Just weeks ago, the woman his brother loved - the only one he\u0027d ever loved - had almost died. Because of Court\u0027s brash actions, the two of them had been hunted down by the Rechazado. Two had followed Annal¨ªa\u0027s brother to the MacCarrick home in London, and had seized her, dragging her outside. When Court had charged after her, one shoved a gun against her temple so hard she\u0027d been bruised. Court could do nothing to help her, could only grate out a strangled plea to Hugh, who, as usual, had been on the periphery and able to back away. Hugh had made it upstairs to his room, snatched up his rifle, and drawn a bead from the second-story window. Never had a shot meant so much - he knew his brother would be destroyed if the girl died. Hugh had succeeded in killing the target in a way that prevented the man from firing, but Annal¨ªa had had to crawl away from the dropped body that still clenched her. Before Court could get to her, she\u0027d slipped in the pooling blood, crying softly. And as he\u0027d seen Court rushing to her, Hugh had been shamed to feel relief - that he himself had never risked Jane. He remembered thinking, \"I\u0027ll die before I expose Jane to something like this.\" But he was.... Jane kissed his ear and murmured, \"A hundred pounds and counting. Care to make it two?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/if-you-desire-maccarrick-brothers-2/page-13.html","bookId":2645,"book":{"id":2645,"title":"If You Desire (MacCarrick Brothers #2)","description":"Storyline: If You Desire (MacCarrick Brothers #2) How much temptation can a Highlander resist?
