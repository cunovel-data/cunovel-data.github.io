Though Grey didn\u0027t blend as perfectly as he had in his prime, he\u0027d been able to get close enough to gossiping servants to garner information.\\n\\n Apparently, Miss Jane was having trunks packed for at least a month, but she couldn\u0027t provide a destination to help them select appropriate clothing to pack. And her lady\u0027s maid was being left behind, while her horse and her bow and quiver were not. Food preparations were being made - refreshments for the minister, who\u0027d arrived early, but no wedding breakfast, as the newlyweds were setting off immediately after the simple ceremony.\\n\\n The servants were sniffling at the news of the wedding and their mistress\u0027s departure. They all fawned over her. Not surprising. Weyland had told Grey and Hugh with obvious pride that Jane had always been generous with her wealth and her time, regardless of a person\u0027s station.\\n\\n The servants were far from enamored of the groom, however. As one of them opined: \"\u0027E\u0027s frightening as \u0027oly \u0027ell and not near good enough for our Miss Jane.\"\\n\\n This was true. Jane was so far out of his league it was laughable. MacCarrick was massive, stony, and intimidating; Jane was a celebrated beauty brimming with wit and charm.\\n\\n And she was MacCarrick\u0027s sole weakness.\\n\\n Grey had discovered that the night of Jane\u0027s coming-out ball - an event Weyland had insisted they attend. Grey had gotten MacCarrick drunk to lure him there, but Hugh had skulked outside, watching her through a window, his body tense. There\u0027d been such longing in his eyes that Grey had realized the young Highlander was in love with the fair Jane.\\n\\n A bear chasing a butterfly.\\n\\n Grey had had to stifle a chuckle at the illogical match - even more so because Hugh hadknown he wasn\u0027t good enough for her, yet he\u0027d been unable to let go of his feelings.\\n\\n More shocking to Grey than Hugh\u0027s capitulation was that Weyland had somehow convinced Jane as well. How? Had he come clean about their occupations? About Grey\u0027s?\\n\\n It had been years since Grey had felt genuine amusement, but this situation was boiling over with such rich irony. An assassin bade to protect a life, the life he held dearest in the world - hiswife\u0027s . And to protect her from abetter assassin.\\n\\n All of them had to know that Grey was a much more accomplished killer than Hugh was a protector.\\n\\n His amusement faded. He hadn\u0027t wanted this to be easy....\\n\\n With Quin and Rolley hovering about them, and a sharp-eyed coach driver who had \"Network\" written all over him on the lookout, Weyland escorted Jane to the coach. Hugh followed, close behind her, behaving as if she had a target on her back.\\n\\n She did. Grey had a clear shot from where he lurked this moment. Unfortunately, his aim was...impaired at present. If he missed, he\u0027d be doing nothing but alerting them that he was in England. No, he would have to get closer.\\n\\n At the coach door, Weyland held Jane\u0027s head in both hands and put his forehead to hers. Her face went stark white, her expression stunned, when her father kissed her cheek good-bye. \"Papa?\" she said in a breaking voice, as if she was just now realizing she was leaving him and her home.\\n\\n Weyland forced himself away, pausing only to squeeze her shoulder and to give MacCarrick a hard look, letting him know what he was trusting him with. Then he left them, his own shoulders sagging like an old man\u0027s - like the old man he was becoming.\\n\\n As Grey watched their actions and interactions in a kind of dazed captivation, he wondered if Weyland had told MacCarrick about the list to convince him. Probably.\\n\\n Greydid have the list, and had threatened to release it, but if that information went public, Weyland would be dead directly. In Weyland\u0027s clandestine service, he\u0027d routinely had to make cold-blooded decisions, dispatching men like Grey, Ethan, and Hugh to carry them out. If those numerous decisions were traced back to Weyland, it would be over.\\n\\n That wasn\u0027t Grey\u0027s agenda, not yet -\\n\\n When a sudden cold clamminess broke out on his neck and back, dampening his shirt, Grey reached into his jacket pocket. He\u0027d anticipated that smoking would be more inconvenient in England than in some other countries, and had had his \"medicine\" prepared differently. He needn\u0027t have bothered. In London, opium was proving easier to find than tobacco and cheaper than gin.\\n\\n But he liked the alteration. He chewed it, relishing it. The taste was like almonds that were slightly off. The texture was gummy.\\n\\n My medicine.He snorted. His body had been ruined from injuries sustained in his profession, and laudanum had made the pain bearable. Upon noticing that Hugh limped himself, especially in the mornings, Grey had offered him some. The bastard had shook his head firmly.So bloody sanctimonious.\\n\\n As he chewed, Grey\u0027s heartbeat slowed to a ponderous rhythm, though he felt more excitement than he could remember. Luckily, with this dosage there would be no hallucinations. He hoped....\\n\\n Ah, and there went Jane, waking as if from a trance, beginning to gesture and fume even as MacCarrick was loading her into the coach. Stubborn Jane wasn\u0027t one to be led blindly, and she was no doubt demanding answers, ones that Hugh clearly wasn\u0027t providing. At the coach door, she stepped up, but turned to say something else to Hugh, putting their faces close. They both fell silent.\\n\\n Grey had compared Hugh to a bear chasing a butterfly. The corners of Grey\u0027s lips tilted up. No, Hugh was better than that - he was like a wolf with a rabbit twitching her tail in front of him.\\n\\n Sooner or later, the wolf would attack.\\n\\n When Hugh shut the carriage door, he stood for just a second, exhaling deeply, as if getting his bearings. He ran a shaking hand over his face, no doubt disbelieving he\u0027d wed the chit.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t worry, Hugh,\" Grey softly assured him. \"It shan\u0027t be for long.\"\\n\\n In the past, if Jane had caught Hugh staring at her breasts, he\u0027d always averted his eyes. In the coach for the last hour, he\u0027d looked at her brazenly, studying her body, as if re-learning it, as if it was hisright to do so. It galled her. He could have had unfettered access to her body. She would have denied him nothing in the past.\\n\\n The fact that she reacted to his heated gaze only infuriated her further. Why couldn\u0027t she have found him less attractive than she had years before? She\u0027d always thought him the most beautiful man she\u0027d ever seen - even before she\u0027d spied on him shucking off his clothes to swim naked in the lake and had gazed in awe at his magnificent body. And now this new hardness about him was nearly irresistible.\\n\\n A living hell, she\u0027d promised him. She\u0027d sounded so strong, so determined.\\n\\n Now she waffled.\\n\\n Stay married, her father had advised. She didn\u0027t want that, couldn\u0027t have that. She\u0027d been forced to accept the alliance, but Hugh hadn\u0027t been and could have saved them both from this.\\n\\n He\u0027d refused.\\n\\n Because Hugh had left her no way out, Jane felt he might as well have pushed her off a cliff. Yes, a nice, big shove, sending her flailing and screaming right over the edge.\\n\\n Inevitably, once she landed, it was going to be messy.\\n\\n She was already livid with him over the past, before he attacked Freddie. Now she was wed to the very man who\u0027d betrayed her, and this on the heels of the rawest show of fury she had ever seen. Hugh in the warehouse had been bad, but this morning he\u0027d been worse. What she couldn\u0027t understand was why.\\n\\n Had he become one of those men whose first reaction always tended toward violence? Or had her father already promised her to him, days, even weeks, before? Which would mean Hugh had thought hisfianc¨¦e had been kissing another? She frowned. Recalling her conversation with her father, she realized he\u0027d never asked herwhy Hugh had attacked Freddie....\\n\\n Hugh\u0027s own explanation had rung hollow, even as he\u0027d uttered it. Yes, Hugh was a close friend of the family\u0027s, and, yes, perhaps she oughtn\u0027t to have been kissing Freddie in the park behind the folly, but nothing excused what he\u0027d done.\\n\\n Jane was angry and she wanted revenge. Her talent still lay in teasing and tormenting. In fact, as she\u0027d pointed out to Hugh, her arsenal had only expanded, thanks to all the tricks she\u0027d learned in her five London seasons among seven master cousins.\\n\\n Hugh should know what he\u0027d given up back then. He should have a taste of what hecouldn\u0027t have now without risking a binding marriage to her.\\n\\n For every hopeless day and night filled with tears, for every man she\u0027d compared to him and found lacking, for his decision to leave her...\\n\\n For all her pain, she would make him pay.\\n\\n \"Oh, Hugh, darling, it\u0027s close in here, is it not?\" She unfastened the first few buttons of her blouse and drew it wide to fan herself. After opening the window on her side, she tugged up her skirts so she could kneel on the bench facing him. She reached past Hugh toward his window, resting one knee against his thigh, and placed her palm just above his own knee. His entire body went rigid.\\n\\n With her other arm stretched out to the window, she turned her head so their lips were barely inches apart. \"You don\u0027t mind, do you, darling?\" she asked in a sensual whisper as she slowly rubbed her palm higher up his rock-hard thigh. His jaw clenched, and he swallowed hard. His brows drew together as though he was in pain.\\n\\n Make him pay.\\n\\n They hit a bump, and though his hands shot to her waist to steady her, she made sure she landed straddling him.\\n\\n He hissed in a breath. \"Jane,\" he growled, tightening his grip. But he didn\u0027t raise her from her position - if anything, his shaking hands on her waist pressed her down.\\n\\n \"What is it, darling?\" she murmured.\\n\\n \"Doona touch me, lass,\" he rasped. \"Just...you canna touch me.\"\\n\\n And pay.\\n\\n \"How clumsy of me,\" she purred. \"Needing you to support me, or else I mightslide...slowly...inch by inch...down upon your \" - she leaned in close to his ear, making sure he felt her breaths before she enunciated - \"lap.\" He shuddered violently, lowering his head to her neck.\\n\\n When she eased back, he faced her, appearing stunned. His normally clenched jaw was slack.\\n\\n She patted his shoulder firmly - all business - then maneuvered and swished back into her seat to gaze casually out the window. \"Yes, darling, now it\u0027smuch better in here.\"\\n\\n Chapter Fourteen\\n\\n Hugh violently rubbed his palms on his legs, struggling for a calm he didn\u0027t possess. His swift, blood-pounding erection strained against his trousers. His breaths came haggard.\\n\\n After wanting her for so long...\\n\\n She didn\u0027t understand just how tenuous his control was, and was even now gazing out the window, unconcerned. But he could see her coral lips curling without humor. She was playing with him, just as she always had.\\n\\n He\u0027d tolerate it no longer.I saw her kissing another goddamned man.\\n\\n His hand shot out to grasp her arm, and her smirk vanished. She turned to him with a glare. \"Hugh, release me.\"\\n\\n He yanked her closer to him on the bench. \"You\u0027d do well to recognize I\u0027m no\u0027 the same lad I was.\"\\n\\n \"And what are you now?\" she asked airily, seemingly unaffected by what had just occurred and by Hugh\u0027s building anger.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m a man with a man\u0027s needs.\" He would teach her, give her this lesson now so that she would stop these flirtations. Because she was right - she had gotten even better, somehow improving on perfection. He sensed it was critical to put her in her place now. His voice grating, he said, \"Doona expect to tease me like that and no\u0027 relieve me in some fashion.\"\\n\\n Her eyes widened, then narrowed. \"Some fashion? Enlighten me, darling.\" Her soft fingertips toyed with his chest in the V of his shirt. Christ, she made him weak. \"How do you usually prefer to be...relieved?\"\\n\\n So she\u0027d meet him measure for measure? He was a man with more experience, he should be able to win this handily. There had to be a line she wouldn\u0027t cross. But could he pull back once they reached it?\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll have tae show you,\" he heard himself saying. In one sweeping motion, he dragged her onto his lap, easing her back against his arm until he was leaning over her. She looked startled - after all, this was the first time he\u0027d ever touched her back when she\u0027d teased - but then a flicker of that stubborn look crossed her face. In the space of a heartbeat, she was all seduction again, reaching out to pet his neck even as she relaxed into his arm.\\n\\n His blood pulsed in his groin, making it hot and aching. When she gasped, he knew she could feel his erection throbbing under her arse. He was having difficulty thinking. Didn\u0027t he have an agenda with this?\\n\\n Kiss her so hard she\u0027ll forget she was in another man\u0027s arms this morning....\\n\\n No.He was only doing this to push her, to startle her, to win this battle of wills. They always used to have them, and Hugh had lost as many as he\u0027d won.\\n\\n Her lips were parted, welcoming. Her body was so damned soft against him. Just one taste.Yes, get this out of the way in the beginning. Of course. He\u0027d only imagined how good kissing her would be, and when that was proved otherwise, he could get past his obsession.\\n\\n He leaned down, never taking his eyes from hers. He felt the lace hem of her skirt clenched in his shaking fist and had no idea how it had gotten there. No doubt he wanted to get to those wicked garters he\u0027d seen her lace around her white thighs this morning.\\n\\n Her open blouse revealed the swells of her creamy breasts above her corset, and he bent to brush his lips over them, stunned to find her skin was as soft as it looked. When she shivered, her playfulness gone, he kissed up to the base of her neck, realizing this was the first time his lips had ever touched her.\\n\\n He inhaled the light scent of her skin and knew that he wouldn\u0027t rest until he\u0027d tasted her. Just once. With a defeated groan, he opened his mouth and flicked his tongue over her flesh. He shuddered with pleasure, and she gave the sweetest little cry, making him want to wrench more from her.\\n\\n \"Is this what you want from me?\" he rasped, drawing back to take in her face. She looked as dazed as he felt, staring at his lips, no doubt wondering how things had escalated so fast.\\n\\n He cupped her nape and slanted his lips over hers. She hesitated as if startled by the contact, then parted her soft, giving lips in offer.\\n\\n Her mouth was hot and wet as he slipped his tongue in, and when she met it, taking his strokes with hers, he stifled a groan. She moaned against him, the sound making his cock pulse painfully in reaction, and soon he was lost in the experience. At last he was tasting and touching her, dazed by sensation.\\n\\n This wasn\u0027t a dream, not a scenario he\u0027d envisioned in a lonely bed in some distant country. He was kissing her. And it wasn\u0027t as good as his imaginings.\\n\\n It wasbetter.\\n\\n His hand had slipped up the outside of her thigh almost to her garter, about to slowly untie -\\n\\n \"Miss Weyland!\" a voice called from outside the carriage. \"I say, is Miss Weyland in there?\"\\n\\n Jane froze, then pulled back. \"Freddie?\" she gasped.\\n\\n Not Bidworth.\\n\\n \"Hugh, we have to stop.\"\\n\\n His gaze flickered over her chest, her neck, her lips. When he met her eyes, he shook his head slowly. Leaning in, he took her mouth once more.\\n\\n She shivered, then pushed against him. \"Stop!\" She scrambled to sit up. \"I am in deadly earnest, Hugh!\"\\n\\n He finally released her, though he struggled not to yank her back when he realized she\u0027d just responded tohim . Such a small taste, after such a long wait, and it was still worth it.\\n\\n But as sanity returned, he disbelieved what he\u0027d done - and been about to do. He had to cough to speak, and still his voice was hoarse when he said, \"Never do that again. Never, Jane, or I vow tae you, I\u0027ll - \"\\n\\n \"Stop the carriage,\" she said, inhaling and exhaling deeply as she fumbled with the buttons of her blouse. When he made no move to do so, she added, \"We\u0027re setting off for a location so secret you aren\u0027t even going to tell me, but if you don\u0027t let me talk to him, he\u0027ll follow us all the way there.\"\\n\\n \"No\u0027 if he\u0027s unable to follow,\" he said quietly.\\n\\n Her eyes widened, and she gazed at him as if she didn\u0027t recognize him. \"You\u0027re crazed, aren\u0027t you? Have the years warped your mind? You listen to me, Hugh MacCarrick. You are not to hurt him again. Do you hear me? Or, so help me God, I will get in the middle and - claw - your - very - eyes - out.\" She gave him a glare to punctuate her threat.\\n\\n \"You told your father that you\u0027d sent a message to him.\"\\n\\n \"Of course I did,\" she said, straightening her hair. He took the opportunity to pull his jacket edges together and furtively adjusted his shaft within his trousers. \"Freddie must have ridden over directly upon receiving it, just missed us, and followed us north.\"\\n\\n Biting back a curse, Hugh called to the driver to stop.\\n\\n \"I want five minutes with him - alone,\" she said, throwing open the coach door.\\n\\n \"No\u0027 a chance - \"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m telling him good-bye. He deserves five minutes of my time. Especially after your attack today.\" She met his eyes. \"Hugh, damn you,please .\"\\n\\n She always knew he couldn\u0027t deny her when she looked up at him like that and said please. When he bit out a curse, she quickly descended before he could assist her. Through the back window, Hugh watched as Bidworth dismounted. When she rushed to him, the bastard laid his hands on her shoulders, then pulled her to his chest.\\n\\n Hugh couldn\u0027t watch this, not now. She was his wife now. Not for good, only temporarily, but for now, she washis.\\n\\n His first impulse was to stalk out there, drag her away from him, then plant his fist in Bidworth\u0027s face again. That last hit had felt so sodding good, and the break at the bridge of Bidworth\u0027s nose was swollen and already blackening his eyes gruesomely. Hugh stifled the impulse, barely, but stayed tensed and ready to reach her in a hurry. He half-expected Bidworth to snatch Jane up and toss her on his horse to steal her.\\n\\n Hugh would have.\\n\\n He would use this time to study them interacting, to determine what type of loss this would be for her. Jane stared up at Bidworth adoringly - but then, it made sense that a woman like her would want a man like him. He was an earl, tall and blond, and they looked rich and aristocratic together. A perfect Briton couple.\\n\\n Hugh was a black-haired Scot with a menacing expression and gashes marring his face.\\n\\n Not to mention his occupation.\\n\\n Jane lightly brushed her fingers over Bidworth\u0027s cheek, and Hugh hated him for it. She touched Bidworth lovingly - as she used to with Hugh. Now she touched Hugh to hurt him.\\n\\n Seeing this was hellish. Put Hugh in a sweltering marsh, force him to stand perfectly still with a rifle poised for a shot for half a day as the sweat stung his eyes and insects devoured his legs, and he would be happier than watching this. Jaw clenched, his hands in fists, Hugh watched as Bidworth refastened her top blouse button and suspected they were already sleeping together.\\n\\n \"Jane, you cannot tell me this is what you want,\" Freddie said. \"I thought we had an understanding.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t, and we did.\" She couldfeel Hugh\u0027s eyes on her and shivered, still affected by how rapidly things had escalated between them. In the past, she could always touch and tease him, and henever touched her back. Just then in the coach, he\u0027d had her in his lap, her bottom pressed against his very sizable and insistent erection, in the space of a heartbeat.\\n\\n His kisses had been scalding, devouring. Until five minutes ago, Jane had never known kisses could be like that. As though Hugh were branding her....\\n\\n As she and Freddie stood at the side of the road, she wanted to adjust their positions, so that Hugh couldn\u0027t see her flushed face - and could only burn holes in her back with his eyes.\\n\\n \"Your father said this MacCarrick has just returned after a long absence,\" Freddie began, \"and that you two had been promised to each other years ago. Is this true?\"\\n\\n In a way. In her mind. \"It\u0027s rather involved, Freddie.\"\\n\\n \"Is Weyland forcing you to do this, sweetheart?\" He stroked her hair. \"Jane, you poor thing. You\u0027re trembling.\" He looked as if he might kiss her to comfort her, and Hugh immediately descended from the carriage, unfolding his towering height. In a clear warning, he crossed his arms and leaned his muscular frame against the side of the carriage.\\n\\n Freddie\u0027s expression was aghast. \"My God, he looks more barbaric than before! I still cannot believe your father is lettinghim marryyou .\" Then Freddie gave Jane a look that suggested he was amazed by her fortitude in surviving the marriage even this long. \"What is Weyland thinking? This won\u0027t be tolerated! We will figure out some way to free you from this man.\"\\n\\n Jane glanced at Hugh and had to admit that he looked fearsome. Unfortunately for her, she\u0027d always liked that about him, when it was directed at others.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll take you away from here this very moment,\" Freddie vowed.\\n\\n In a toneless voice, she said, \"It\u0027s done, I\u0027m afraid.\" Yes, her father did have significant influence with persons of power, but even he wouldn\u0027t be able to smooth this one over.\\n\\n In her letter to Freddie, Jane had broken it off with him - completely.\\n\\n \"This is probably for the best,\" she said with a sigh. \"You know your mother and sister don\u0027t approve of me.\" She would have been Lady Whiting by the skin of her teeth.\\n\\n \"I hope that is not what has swayed you in this, because I say to hell with them.\"\\n\\n Despite these heroic promises now, Freddie actually wasn\u0027t accustomed to taking stands or becoming involved in discord in any way. That was one of the reasons she\u0027d liked him so much, because he was so opposite to Hugh, who\u0027d always been so quick to roll up his sleeves and fight for her.\\n\\n \"I just don\u0027t understand this,\" Freddie continued. \"I-I won\u0027t accept this!\"\\n\\n Yes, he would. Because the truth was that he wasn\u0027t in love with her, either. He\u0027d lost his heart to Candace Damferre, their mutual friend and his childhood sweetheart, who\u0027d been forced to marry a doddering old man who was, impossibly, richer than Freddie.\\n\\n But Jane and Freddie had promised each other that if they did wed, they\u0027d do their best to make a go of it, and Jane had known that Freddie was looking forward to a future with her. The entire situation waswrong .\\n\\n \"I\u0027d be sending you off to your doom - \" He broke off as Hugh stalked toward them, exuding menace. Freddie\u0027s voice scaled an octave higher when he said, \"He\u0027s going to hit me again, isn\u0027t he?\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/if-you-desire-maccarrick-brothers-2/page-7.html","bookId":2645,"book":{"id":2645,"title":"If You Desire (MacCarrick Brothers #2)","description":"Storyline: If You Desire (MacCarrick Brothers #2) \\n How much temptation can a Highlander resist?
