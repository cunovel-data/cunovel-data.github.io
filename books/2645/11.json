{"id":103671,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"Chapter Twenty-one\n Jane slammed the door on Hugh hard enough to make him grit his teeth just before the impact. The pictures on the walls were still rattling when she locked it behind her.\n After two days trapped at Ros Creag, the MacCarricks\u0027 depressing lakeside manor, with Hugh\u0027s curt surliness as company, she was ready to march up to Grey and say, \"Do your worst. I defy you.\"\n The only reason she hadn\u0027t hied herself off to a cousin\u0027s estate was that members of her family were due to arrive at Vinelands any day now. Not that Hugh knew that. \"At this season, there will no\u0027 be many around,\" he\u0027d said, defending his decision to take her here. But her family sought out the quiet fall season when there weren\u0027tmany around , since it was the only time they could be themselves....\n \"Jane, I\u0027ve warned you about locking the door,\" Hugh grated outside her room. \"Open it, or this time I\u0027ll break the goddamned thing down.\"\n \"As you said yesterday - \"\n The door burst open.\n She gaped, as much from the wildly swinging door and splintered doorframe as from Hugh\u0027s lethally calm demeanor - he wasn\u0027t even out of breath.\n \"I\u0027ll be damned if I can figure out why you\u0027ve been angry,\" he said. \"But I\u0027ve about had enough of this.\"\n \"As have I!\"\n \"You know, I always wondered what it\u0027d be like to live with y - with a woman.\"\n \"And?\"\n \"It\u0027s a wee bit like hell, with your carrying on.\"\n \"What do you construe as carrying on?\" she asked, indignant. \"When I avoid you because you\u0027ve cut me off at every attempt I\u0027ve made to start a conversation? Why would Iwant to be around you when talking to you is like pulling teeth?\"\n \"And how\u0027s that?\"\n \"I asked you why your brothers haven\u0027t married, and you snapped, \u0027Drop the subject.\u0027 I asked you why none of you have any children, and you said, \u0027Enough of this.\u0027 I asked you if you\u0027ve ever considered adding a trellis and a rose arbor,anything to soften the grimness of this place, and you just walked out of the room! I\u0027ve never met a surlier man.\"\n \"If I am, it\u0027s because you\u0027ve ignored everything I\u0027ve asked of you.\"\n \"Like what?\"\n \"I asked you to avoid the windows, yet I continue to catch you in the window seat in the upstairs parlor, staring out at Vinelands. I\u0027ve asked you to pick up things in your room, and you tell me it\u0027s your \u0027horizontal system\u0027 and that if I canna discern it then I must be stupid.\"\n Everybody who knew Jane knew she was untidy - her lady\u0027s maid played solitaire and read gothic novels all day because Jane wouldn\u0027t let her straighten much - but untidy worked for Jane. Without her system, how would she ever find anything?\n \"And you refuse to let the maid clean up here,\" Hugh finished.\n \"I don\u0027t wish to cause any extra work for anyone, and the servants are only here for a few hours a day. If it bothers you so terribly - and, really, Hugh, when did you get to be so exacting? - you can keep the door closed.\"\n \"You know I canna do that.\"\n She sighed and trudged across the plush rugs to peer out the window. Ros Creag, which meant \"stony promontory,\" was as forbidding and no-nonsense as its name, just as it had been in the past. But then, the appearance did exactly what it was meant to - it kept people away. Had this place been welcoming, the MacCarrick brothers would have been overrun with Weylands borrowing fishing gear and foodstuffs, dropping off pies....\n Everywhere she looked outside, the gardens were freakishly orderly, as though a gardener had laid out the shrubs and flowers to the inch with a ruler, then ruthlessly checked any undue exuberance. The manor was stately but imposing, its bricks made of dark rock, like the craggy, lakeside cliff it clung to.\n Though separated from Vinelands by just that small cove, this place was a world away from it. Whereas Ros Creag was stern and solitary upon a cliff, Vinelands occupied an expanse of lawn rolling down to the water and a swimming beach, and looked like a quaint country cottage, though it had eight bedrooms. Arbors and follies dotted the property, and a small dock crawled lazily from the shore into the water.\n And Hugh wondered why she\u0027d always preferred her own home to his.\n \"So you truly doona like it here.\" His words came from just behind her, but she hadn\u0027t heard him approach. She frowned, recalling that he\u0027d done that in London, too. He used to stride loudly, his boots booming across the floor. Now he was all sneaky silence.\n With a shrug, she turned and headed for the door. One good thing about Ros Creag? It was big enough that they need never see each other.\n Damn, she\u0027d been nettled since the night he\u0027d kissed her. Apparently, Jane agreed with everyone else that Hugh reached too high in wedding her.\n As he watched her walking away, he told himself yet again that it didn\u0027t matter. Once Grey had been killed and she was completely out of danger, Hugh would leave her just as he had before.\n And go where? Do what? If the list went public, he would have no profession. He\u0027d thought about joining up with Court\u0027s crew of Highland mercenaries, but had dismissed the idea. Hugh was a loner, always working solo. Always on the periphery.\n Except with Jane. She was the only person on this earth he\u0027d ever been able to be around constantly. Hell, he\u0027d never beenable to spend enough time with her, had always yearned for more.\n Now that he\u0027d gotten his wish, he wanted to take it back.\n No, he could tolerate this. The situation was only temporary.\n Yet it wasn\u0027t only the clutter or even her continued pique that bothered him. It had finally hit him that he would beliving with her, under the same roof, appearing as man and wife. She was so mysteriously feminine, and never having lived with a woman, he found himself a shade overwhelmed.\n With a grated sound of frustration, he strode after her, picking his way around piles of clothing. Hugh was uncomfortable with disarray, having come to crave order and structure in everything. Without order, came randomness; Hugh hated random. He felt he\u0027d been chosen at random for his fate, and he resented the lack of control.\n Weren\u0027t women supposed to be fastidious, organized creatures? More unfortunate for him, much of Jane\u0027s disarray came in the form of her fascinating undergarments. There were garters he hadn\u0027t seen in her room in London, and even stockings with designs in them.\n \"Wait, Jane.\" He caught her elbow just as she reached the hallway. \"Tell me why you doona like it here.\"\n \"I\u0027m used to being around family and friends, everyone talking and laughing, and you take me away from all that to stay in thisdepressing - there, I\u0027ve said it - manor. And even then I could tolerate it, if you were fit company.\"\n \"What is so bad about this place?\" he asked, glancing around with an incredulous expression. \"You never liked coming here in the past, either. Why?\"\n \"Why?I would have to leave my house - where there was whistling, and my uncles chasing their giggling wives, and happy children running about like wild creatures - to come here, where the curtains were drawn, and it was as dark and silent as a tomb.\"\n \"I was just as uneasy at your home.\"\n \"Why on earth?\"\n He doubted he could ever convince her that her family\u0027s behavior might make outsiders uncomfortable, much less someone as solitary as Hugh. But her locking the door on him rankled on so many levels, and he was just irritated enough to say, \"Your aunts ran about with their skirts hiked up, fishing, smoking, passing a bottle of wine between them. And sometimes when your unclescaught your aunts and swooped them upstairs, they weren\u0027t as quiet as they could have been with what they were doing.\"\n \"And how would you even know that, from the collective fifteen minutes you spent with them over five years?\" When he said nothing, she asked, \"Do you deny assiduously avoiding everyone but my father?\"\n He couldn\u0027t deny it - he\u0027d never wanted Jane to see how awkward he was around groups of people. \"You ken I\u0027ve usually preferred my own company.\"\n \"At least my family was kind to you. Unlike your brothers\u0027 treatment of me.\"\n \"My brothers were no\u0027 unkind to you.\"\n \"Are you jesting? One entire summer, Ethan crept about like a frightful ghost in his lair with the entire side of his face bandaged from some mysterious injury - which you would never talk about. And if anyone happened to glance at his face, he\u0027d roar with fury and run them off.\"\n Ethan had been a harrowing sight that summer. And every summer after. \"And Court?\"\n She gave him an incredulous look. \"My God, I think he\u0027s the angriest man I\u0027ve ever encountered, always simmering. You never knew when he was going to go off. Being around him was like sidling around a bear trap. And it wasn\u0027t a secret that he wasted no love on me.\"\n No, Court had never liked Jane. Hugh supposed Court had resented the girl who tagged along with them everywhere and was frustrated that Hugh didn\u0027t mind at all. That last summer, Court had despised her teasing treatment of his brother, never considering that Hugh woke every morning impatient to return for it, day after day.\n But Hugh hadn\u0027t known Jane felt as strongly about Court, and about Ethan, as well. \"I dinna realize it was so bad.\"\n \"You never seemed to notice these things because you were so used to them.\" She adjusted a vase on a shining end table, as if she couldn\u0027t stand its perfect placement. Seeming to calm herself, she said, \"Hugh, rehashing all this will help nothing. When I ask you questions, you don\u0027t have to answer them, and you can be as dismissive as you please. That\u0027s your prerogative. My prerogative is that I don\u0027t have to be around you when it\u0027s avoidable.\"\n \"The subjects you brought up are difficult ones.\"\n She raised her eyebrows, waiting for more.\n \"If I answer one question, you\u0027ll ask a dozen more about my answer, no matter if I doona want to talk about it. You\u0027re no\u0027 happy until everything\u0027s laid bare.\"\n \"I do apologize for wanting to know more about a man I used to be friends with, who disappeared for years without a word, who has now returned to be my husband in an odd marriage of convenience.\"\n \"Damn it, I told your father to tell you good-bye.\"\n She glared at that. \"Don\u0027t you think I deserved it from you? It\u0027s becoming clear to me that wedidn\u0027t have the friendship I\u0027d imagined. I must have been like a gnat in your ear, a silly little girl who followed you around when you only wanted to hunt or fish with your brothers.\"\n \"Wewere friends - \"\n \"A friend would have told me good-bye when he knew he was leaving and had no intention of returning for years.\"\n Couldshe have thought of him? Could she havemissed him? \"Are you angry about that?\"\n \"I\u0027m puzzled. I would have told you good-bye.\"\n \"I dinna believe you would even think of me much after I\u0027d gone. I dinna think you would care overmuch one way or the other.\"\n She didn\u0027t deny it or confirm it, just continued, \"But now you\u0027ve come back and we\u0027re in this confusing situation, and I\u0027m trying to reason it all out, but I don\u0027t have enough information. Papa told me this might take months. Are we to be like this the entire time, with you cutting me off or getting angry when I ask questions?\"\n \"I doona want to be that way. I just...I just doona know how to handle this as well as I should.\"\n \"What do you mean by \u0027this\u0027?\"\n He pinched the bridge of his nose. \"Jane, sometimes you throw me. And I\u0027m unused to being married - even if it\u0027s only temporary.\"\n \"Very well, Hugh. Let\u0027s start with an easy question.\" When she raised her eyebrows, he nodded grimly. \"Why would my father ever find occasion to associate with someone as deranged and violent as Grey?\"\n That\u0027s an easy question?\"Grey was no\u0027 always like this. He came from a wealthy and well-respected family. He had strong connections.\"\n \"And he was your good friend?\"\n \"Aye.\"\n \"Did you try to help him with his affliction?\"\n Hugh chose every word carefully, knowing he owed her more of the truth, but unable to divulge his own dealings without revealing everyone\u0027s. \"I attempted to reason with him, bully him, bargain with him. Nothing worked.\"\n After that, Hugh and Ethan had decided to take matters into their own hands to wean him from opium. They\u0027d captured Grey and carted him back to one of Ethan\u0027s estates.\n Grey had been furious, frothing at the mouth, spouting insults. Either he had always been a sick bastard - and opium, like liquor, magnified his faults - or his entire personality had been altered.\n He\u0027d vowed that if Hugh couldn\u0027t \"muster the ballocks to finally go fuck Jane Weyland as she so clearly needs,\" then he\u0027d make short work of her. Hugh barely remembered lunging for Grey\u0027s throat and raining blows on his face. Ethan had scarcely been able to haul Hugh off. Afterward, all three of them had seemed shocked by Hugh\u0027s utter loss of control.\n But after two weeks in a basement, Grey had emerged, seemingly cured. For a year, Hugh had believed he\u0027d maintained an even keel. Ethan, however, suspected Grey only waited for a chance to strike out, and he\u0027d been right.\n \"I thought for a while that he\u0027d gotten better. But the last time I saw him, his pupils were like pinpricks even in the night....\"\n Seeing Hugh\u0027s disappointment, Grey had self-consciously smoothed his soiled jacket and given him a half grin, and with it a glimpse of his old self. His accent had been clipped and proper, even as he looked away and said softly, \"I didn\u0027t want to be like this, you know.\"\n \"Then why?\" Hugh had asked.\n \"Not quite the way I\u0027d planned things, as it were,\" he\u0027d continued lightly, but when Hugh said nothing, Grey finally cast Hugh a look that was raw, unguarded. \"I woke up one morning, and I was nothing but that number.\" He averted his face again as if embarrassed. \"Good-bye, Scot.\" Then he\u0027d walked away....\n Hugh shook off the memory. \"He was lost for good.\"\n \"Do you miss your friendship with him?\"\n After a long hesitation, Hugh nodded. He did, even as he now burned for Grey to die - and even as Hugh knew his brother was out in the world, seeking to kill him.\n Chapter Twenty-two\n \"Hugh! It\u0027s me.\"\n He blinked his eyes open. He was clutching Jane\u0027s wrist as she leaned over him, her expressive face full of worry. He released her and fell back onto the bed. \"Jane?\" He ran his hand over his brow, finding it damp with sweat.\n \"What\u0027re you doing in here?\"\n \"I heard something. I thought you were having a nightmare.\"\n \"Aye.\" He was often plagued with nightmares, murky scenes of targets who refused to die. He had always strived to make clean shots, to make it quick. But sometimes at great distances, in inclement weather, he\u0027d failed to do so. When the shot was off the mark, they often writhed; some screamed shrilly. \"Did I say anything?\"\n She shook her head. \"What was the nightmare about?\"\n \"No\u0027 important.\" It was then that he noticed her nightdress. Clinging, sheer white silk. His gaze dropped to her breasts - and she noticed, nibbling her lip.\n At once, he sat up and snatched a bundle of the cover over his sudden erection. \"Damn it, you canna come in dressed like that.\" His voice was hoarse.\n \"I rushed in when I heard you. I didn\u0027t stop for a robe.\"\n \"When will you learn, Jane? I\u0027ve told you, I\u0027ve a man\u0027s needs. And when I see you like this...\" - he shook his head hard - \"it affects me. I doona want to do something we\u0027d both regret.\"\n She quirked an eyebrow. \"You\u0027re saying the sight of me in a nightgown is so irresistible it might make you, a man of the world, lose control?\"\n \"Aye,\" he said simply, then added, \"I\u0027ve been long without a woman, Jane, and you are verra beautiful - \"\n \"What do you mean,long ?\" She angrily crossed her arms. \"As in four days?\"\n He frowned. \"What\u0027re you speaking of?\"\n \"I saw you go into Lysette\u0027s room. And come out with your shirt untucked.\"\n His eyes narrowed. \"You would no\u0027 have seen that if you had stayed locked in the room.\"\n Her voice was cutting. \"That is of no matter.\"\n \"She tried to seduce me.\"\n \"Tried to, or succeeded?\"\n \"Are you jealous?\" He didn\u0027t dare hope she could be. Didn\u0027t dare hope she felt the blistering envy that clawed at him when he thought of her with another.\n She put her chin up and sniffed, \"You spent our wedding night in the arms of another woman. I hardly felt complimented by it.\"\n \"So it\u0027s your vanity that\u0027s been injured.\" Disappointment settled over him. In a deadened tone, he said, \"I dinna sleep with her.\"\n \"Youdidn\u0027t ?\" Her arms fell to her sides as if they\u0027d gone boneless.\n \"Why do you sound so disbelieving?\"\n \"It was clear she wanted you.\"\n \"I took a vow to you, and until that vow is annulled, I\u0027ll keep it. Now, go back to your room.\"\n Her hand fluttered to her forehead. \"I see.\" Strangely, her face had paled. After a moment, she nodded. \"I\u0027ll try to straighten my room. And don\u0027t worry about me \u0027carrying on\u0027 anymore.\"\n \"And what\u0027s brought about this change?\" Hugh demanded, about to bellow with frustration. \"Because now your vanity\u0027s intact and you lost no competition with Lysette? So you can go back to being decent to me?\"\n She seemed to flinch at that. \"It wasn\u0027t competitiveness or vanity. And I\u0027m sorry for how I\u0027ve behaved.\" She looked as though she genuinely meant it.\n His ire eased somewhat, and he softened his tone. \"Then what, Jane?\n Twining her hands, she said nothing.\n \"You\u0027re making me crazed, lass. I know you\u0027re unhappy, and I doona know how to change that.\" He rubbed his forehead, and exhaled. \"Tell me how to change that.\"\n At length, she whispered, \"I was unhappy because I was jealous.\"\n Jane left him with his lips parted and brows drawn, and withdrew to her room, easing the door nearly closed.\n She stood trembling against the wall with her hands flat against the rich wainscoting. Though she\u0027d wanted to stay in his room, she\u0027dstepped back . She was proud of herself and felt mature for her decision, especially since she\u0027d been flooded with compelling impulses - along with many Bad Ideas on how to handle them. She was a mix of roiling emotions.\n It was possible that Jane could have been more awful to Hugh over the past few days, but she couldn\u0027t conceive of how. \"I know you\u0027re unhappy, and I doona know how to change that,\" he\u0027d said, sounding so weary. Immediately, Jane had remembered her father\u0027s words - Hugh tries....\n She squeezed her eyes tight, embarrassed at her cutting behavior, even as she was sopleased with him, so relieved that Hugh hadn\u0027t touched that woman. Of course, a major deterrent to her feelings for him had just been eliminated. Which brought abouther revelation.\n Was she right back where she\u0027d been at the inn as she sat on the table? When she\u0027d feared letting him out of her sight?\n Yes -\n Jane\u0027s eyes shot open when Hugh\u0027s hand wrapped around the back of her neck. He\u0027d pulled on his pants and entered her room silently, giving her little warning before he dragged her to his naked chest. Leaning down, he slanted his lips over hers, groaning at the contact. He broke away only to ask, \"You were truly jealous?\" then set back in.\n Telling him the truth could open her up to hurt, could accelerate the rate at which she dropped off that cliff. And still, between their licking, seeking kisses, she whispered, \"I didn\u0027t want you kissing her. Because you should\u0027ve still been kissing me.\"\n At her admission, he tensed, hesitating for only a heartbeat before he lifted her in his arms, striding with her back to his bedroom.\n \"Hugh?\" she murmured in a daze. \"What are you doing?\"\n \"I\u0027ve something on my mind,\" he said, setting her on the bed, following her down. As he leaned above her, his dark hungry gaze flickered over her, and his voice broke low. \"Something I need tae see.\"\n He rubbed an unsteady hand over his mouth, looking like a man in agony. His body seemed to thrum with tension. Frowning, she brought her palms up to cup his face, but he shuddered, even at that slight touch. What was happening here?\n For all the books she\u0027d read, for all that she\u0027d heard from her cousins and learned in London, she\u0027dnever imagined a man behaving like this - as though he were about to die from desire. The erotic books she\u0027d read never had accounts of men\u0027s bodiesshuddering with lust, pained with a need so great they could scarcely speak and could barely stand to be touched.\n He reached forward to brush her nightdress straps down her shoulders, then dipped a kiss to her collarbone. Just as she felt cool air on her breasts and belly, he hissed something in Gaelic, and sank back on his haunches to stare. She felt his gaze on her bared skin like a touch and arched her back for him.\n Leaning forward once more, he rasped, \"Mercy.\"\n She thought she would scream in pleasure with the first wet flick of his tongue to her aching nipple. He cradled her breast with his whole hand, holding her in place as he sucked her between his lips.\n \"Hugh,\" she moaned, threading her fingers through his thick hair. \"It feels so good when you do that.\"\n His other hand was easing upward between her legs, his fingers caressing as they slowly ascended. \"Tell me tae stop this,\" he said against her breast.\n She shook her head, body quivering when he kneaded her inner thigh, coaxing her to spread her legs wider. The rough texture of his hand abraded her tender skin, but she loved it.\n \"Tell me now.\" His palm rubbed upward. She shook her head again and whimpered, afraid she was about to climax. She didn\u0027t want this ever to end.\n \"Ah, God, I canna stop.\" His fingers passed the thatch between her legs. \"I need tae stroke you here.\"\n She cried out when he slipped the pad of his thumb against her clitoris, rubbing it sensuously. Another finger delved to her slick sex. \"So wet.\" He lowered his head, and against her damp nipple, he said, \"You\u0027d be ready for me, would you no\u0027?\"\n When he spread the moisture and continued his slow, agonizing strokes, she writhed helplessly to his touch. \"Please, Hugh,\" she said, panting. \"Don\u0027t stop.\"\n He raised his head, studying her face. \"I will no\u0027.\" His voice sounded hoarse, lost. \"I want tae make you...make you come for me.\" He stroked more firmly. \"Taesee you - \"\n She gave a strangled moan - she was already there. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/if-you-desire-maccarrick-brothers-2/page-11.html","bookId":2645,"book":{"id":2645,"title":"If You Desire (MacCarrick Brothers #2)","description":"Storyline: \n If You Desire (MacCarrick Brothers #2) \n How much temptation can a Highlander resist?
