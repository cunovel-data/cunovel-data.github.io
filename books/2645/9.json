{"id":103669,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"Chapter Seventeen Hugh almost asked himself what he\u0027d done to deserve this torment, but the answer would be too lengthy. She was running her hands up and down her long, long legs. He suspected she knew he could see, though she was such a sensual person that he\u0027d wager she rubbed her legs as lingeringly when she was alone. What else did she linger over? The thought of her running her fingers over her sex...He had to gnash his teeth as his erection stiffened even more. He\u0027d wager anything he owned that she did indeed touch herself like that whenever the need arose. Did she ever think of him? He unfailingly did of her. After Hugh had seen her last night, even his beaten, fatigued body had hungered for her, and he\u0027d taken himself in hand. She had always been forward-thinking about sexual matters, and he knew she was filled with passion - passion that would need an outlet. He remembered Bidworth buttoning her blouse. Had Bidworth fulfilled her needs? Hugh should have killed him. How long before he could escape this impossible situation?Hurry up, Ethan. Else I\u0027ll go mad . Striving to think of other things, distracting things, he paced to the window. Hugh hadn\u0027t wanted to stay here. There were too many people he knew, and one who was privy to exactly what he was - Lysette, Grey\u0027s ex-lover. But they wouldn\u0027t have reached the next inn until nearly dawn, and once Jane had begun insisting, Hugh had thought he might as well try to extract some information from Lysette about Grey. Lysette had always been partial to Hugh, and Grey had left her to be with a whore. Yet the incident in the common room had proved this was a bad idea. Hugh should have had his arm around Jane\u0027s shoulders, but he\u0027d been dragging her along to get through the crowds. And Jane had taken one look at Hugh\u0027s expression as he fought the urge to deal the drunkard a blow, and she\u0027d known - not precisely what he was, but definitely what he wasn\u0027t. He heard her rise from the water. Bounder that he was, he leaned back. When he caught a glimpse of her, he had to bite back a curse and shuffle his feet to keep his balance. In the space between the panels, he could see her damp back and hissed in a breath at the sight of the spot where her surprisingly generous arse met her long, slim leg. He closed his eyes briefly, berating himself for looking - even as he imagined striding forward to palm that taut cleft as he ran his mouth down her neck. He was stunned anew at how shapely she\u0027d become. Her arms and legs were still slender, her torso as well, but her breasts and arse were plump and seemed to taunt his hands to cup them.Pull her to the bed, cover her wet, slick body with mine, take her furiously - The maid knocked once more, possibly saving them from disaster, and entered to set out their dinner on the room\u0027s dining table. Hugh stayed facing the window since his cock was stiff as wood. When the girl left, he sat so Jane wouldn\u0027t notice. He found the fare was simple, but the wine appeared to be a tolerable vintage. A few minutes later, Jane emerged from behind the screen, having donned a deep blue dressing gown and wrap. She wore the wrap open enough that he could see the pale tops of her breasts. When he could drag his gaze away from them, he saw that her shining hair was loose, with damp tendrils curling all about her face. Her flawless skin was pinkened, her eyes bright. She was elegant and fine, the lines of her face and body so pure. For a moment he just wanted to pretend that he was a lucky bastard who\u0027d somehowtruly landed her as wife. He wanted to pretend he saw her fresh from the bath at his leisure, and dined with her every night before they went to bed together. Here he was with a woman so lovely she\u0027d make any man conscious of his words and actions, concerned about how she perceived him. She would unnerve most men. And yet she was stillJane . And when she allowed it, it was so damned easy being around her. \"My wedding night.\" She sauntered to her seat. \"Darling, it isjust as I\u0027ve always dreamed.\" She wasn\u0027t going to allow it. He felt a flare of anger. Everything he was doing was for her benefit. Now, if she would just allow him to do his job unhindered...\"My wedding night as well. I\u0027m just as disappointed.\" \"Disappointed in the circumstance - or your bride?\" Never taking her eyes from his, she took a sip of the wine he\u0027d poured, then dabbed her tongue to her bottom lip. He shifted in his seat. \"Any man would be proud to call you wife.\" \"Then, does this disappointment have anything to do with the fact that you\u0027d sworn never to marry?\" \"Partly.\" \"Partly? So why else...?\" She trailed off, eyes widening. \"You have a lover, don\u0027t you? One you didn\u0027t want to forsake? That\u0027s it, isn\u0027t it? You already have a woman.\" \"I\u0027m...between,\" he said, hedging. He had never formed an attachment with another woman - didn\u0027t think he\u0027d slept with the same one twice. If he got angry enough at the world, he might drink and take a woman to try to forget, but it just worsened his resentment. Court had once asked Hugh why he bedded so few.If you felt like I did after, you would no\u0027 either. \"I just never had any intention of marrying - \" \"Never?\" she asked in a strange tone. \"It was not in my plans,\" he said. She drank deeply. \"Between, then, is it? I\u0027ll bet you\u0027ve had a lot of women.\" \"I\u0027ll no\u0027 speak of this with you.\" \"You used to tell me your secrets.\" Never the big ones. Though he\u0027d burned to. Hugh had often considered telling Jane about that terrible and weighty curse, but knew she would scoff. Jane could be irrational, temperamental, unreasonable - but she was never,never fanciful. He could just imagine her smirking and playing along: \"Then I must eschew your cursed company, darling, for I quite fancy being alive.\" And now, why would he tell her? The closeness they\u0027d shared was gone. \"So, Hugh, what do youtruly do? You\u0027re not a businessman. Unless a nefarious import attacked your face?\" He raised his eyebrows at that. She was such a curious female, and one who had an infuriating habit of deducing and then deciding fixedly on her own theories. That could help him now. \"Knowing you, you\u0027ve worked out a theory as to what I am.\" She put her hand out, palm up, motioning for him to give her his hand. Before he even had time to think better of it, he\u0027d reached across the table. She captured his hand in hers, then ran the soft pads of her fingers over the calloused, scarred skin of his palm. Such a simple touch, but she made it sensual. Glancing up, she met his eyes. \"I believe you\u0027re a mercenary.\" She was getting close. \"Is that what you do?\" Increasing the pressure, she ran her forefinger down the center of his palm, then back up. His voice was rough when he asked, \"What makes you think that?\" \"It make sense. Father said you\u0027d just come from travels with your brother Courtland on the Continent. Court is a known soldier of fortune - we\u0027ve all heard of him wreaking havoc down there with a band of Highlanders. You must be one of them.\" Hughhad been in Andorra riding with his brother\u0027s men, but he\u0027d only been there to help Court. They\u0027d fought the Orden de Rechazado - the Order of the Disavowed, a band of fanatical assassins bent on killing Court and Annal¨ªa. \"That would be how you cut your face,\" Jane continued, with a feathery brush over the back of his hand. \"And that\u0027s how you saved up some money.\" Somemoney? Hugh had turned his earnings into wealth with meticulous planning and calculated speculation. He was rich by anyone\u0027s standards, with a grand seaside estate in Scotland. Her words sparked another first for Hugh - the unfamiliar need to boast, to impress her. Which was purposeless. \"Why do you no\u0027 believe I work in your father\u0027s business?\" \"Hugh, I\u0027m not a complete imbecile.\" She tapped her finger against the worst scar on the back of his hand. \"Look at your hands. And look at how muscular and fit you are. You did not hone a physique like that by working incommerce .\" He checked a flush of pleasure at her inadvertent compliment and said, \"I get outdoors a lot.\" \"I\u0027ve been to pugilist matches with my cousins.\" Her wee hands worked his into a fist, and she studied it before meeting his gaze once more. \"I know what those fighters are capable of, yet after I saw the way you hit Freddie, I\u0027d put you up against them with stacked odds.\" Another roundabout compliment. He thought. \"I had two brothers. I received a lot of practice. You ken that I used to fight with Ethan more hours than no\u0027.\" Of course, she was aware he was being evasive, but he knew that was only making her dig in her heels. \"Father covered for your career as a mercenary, didn\u0027t he?\" She released his hand abruptly. \"The youngest son gone bad would be met with a clucked tongue and a head shake. But two brothers? That would start to affect Ethan\u0027s reputation, and he has a title.\" Ethan\u0027s reputation? She had no idea. How such a cold-blooded bastard could somehow keep his deeds secret amazed Hugh. Especially since Ethan had never bothered to try to. Still, he only shrugged. She leaned back. \"Hugh MacCarrick, the mercenary. Unless you want to offer another explanation.\" \"No, no\u0027 at all.\"Take that one, lass, and run with it. \"What do mercenaries do?\" \"Mercenaries fight for money - professional soldiers.\" \"Have you gotten to travel all over the world?\" she asked, her tone suddenly wistful. \"No\u0027 to many places you\u0027d want to tour.\" \"It must be exciting at times.\" When he said nothing, she admitted, \"I\u0027ve always wanted to travel to exotic places. Quin has promised again and again to take Claudia and me on a grand adventure, but he\u0027s always so busy.\" Quin, take them traveling? Only if the two lasses wanted a tour of the world\u0027s upscale brothels. \"Do you ever get scared?\" she asked. \"During the fighting?\" Hugh\u0027s objective was to avoid fighting. \"Even if I did, men doona admit to things like that.\" \"So you\u0027ve been in wars? How many people have you killed?\" He ignored her question. \"You\u0027re no\u0027 eating, though you told me you were famished.\" \"I am.\" At his look, she amended, \"I\u0027m eating distilled grapes. Answer me, won\u0027t you?\" \"I have no\u0027 kept a count.\" Grey had taught him that. He\u0027d said,One day, Scot, you\u0027ll wake up, and you won\u0027t be anything more than that number. \"Whatdid happen to your face?\" She would bring that up again. She was pale and perfect in her silk. When Grey had begun sinking farther into the abyss, he\u0027d loved to remind Hugh how far out of reach a woman like her was for a man like Hugh - a man with a beaten, pained body that made him feel so damn old and weary, a man who was awkward in social situations. A man who\u0027d crossed a line from which there was no going back. \"I was cut by falling rocks.\" After he\u0027d exploded a mountaintop to blow up the Rechazado camp - while they were still in it. \"There was an accident.\" True, he hadn\u0027tmeant to be in the way of a shower of slate. Hugh had killed thirty Rechazados, dead in an instant. She has no idea what kind of man sits across from her. \"On the job?\" She looked as if she was truly curious about him. But it wasn\u0027t genuine interest. She only delved to gather what Hugh refused to give her - andonly because he\u0027d refused. Jane loved nothing more than fighting for something she wanted. He took a drink of wine, remembering that he was the fool who\u0027d encouraged that drive. Once, when she was fifteen, Hugh and a grumbling Court had taken her to a nearby archery tournament. When the other female contestants discovered that she\u0027d entered, none would compete against her. Hugh had seen the sharp disappointment in her eyes, a glimpse of a vulnerability that was so rarely seen. It had torn at him, and he\u0027d found himself telling her under his breath, \"Challenge the men, lass.\" She\u0027d brought a bloody medal home. It hadn\u0027t been her first - there was a reason the women knew they\u0027d be trounced - but Jane had stared at it as though it were, as if with that one came realization. She\u0027d clutched it in two hands and met his gaze. \"I wantmore .\" \"You\u0027ve the skill for it,\" he\u0027d said, hedging, saddened. He\u0027d known there weren\u0027t many more for a young lass to go out and fight for - no matter how badly sheneeded that fight.... \"That\u0027s why you don\u0027t want to be married?\" she asked. \"Your job would prevent it.\" \"Jane, why is it that I\u0027m always the one being interrogated?\" \"At least tell me where we\u0027re going.\" \"If I\u0027d told you this morning, would you have told Bidworth?\" \"No,\" she said quickly, then admitted, \"Well, I might have. But Freddie wouldn\u0027t have told a soul.\" \"Then no, I will no\u0027 tell you.\" When she opened her mouth to argue, he made his voice like steel. \"No more questions.\" She sighed, glancing around the room, visibly restless. She didn\u0027t seem to notice when her wrap slid from her smooth, pale shoulder, while every muscle in his body tensed. The thin nightdress beneath clung to her breast, and he found he couldn\u0027t drag his riveted gaze from it. The material was so stark against her fair skin, and he imagined brushing the silk down her shoulders, letting it whisper over her nipples and slide down her lithe body. He exhaled a breath and hoped it sounded exasperated instead of enthralled. \"Put your wrap back on.\" She glanced down with a frown, then studied his reaction. \"I need to leave it off. Because it\u0027s warm in here, and I can\u0027task you to crack a window.\" \"Put it back on.\" She quirked an eyebrow. \"You stared at my breasts so much in the coach today, you should appreciate when more of them is displayed.\" \"I admit I take pleasure in looking at you.\" He wouldn\u0027t even bother trying to deny that. Even now, her small nipples jutted hard against the fabric, and he imagined taking one between his lips, feeling it swell and throb as he sucked it. He glanced away and said quietly, \"You\u0027re a beautiful woman.\" When he turned back, he thought she had blushed at his comment. \"But seeing you like this makes me desire to do more, a desire you doona share and one we canna indulge.\" She tilted her head, seeming to weigh his words very carefully, then said, \"What if I told you I did share that desire?\" \"I\u0027d answer that you\u0027re a merciless flirt, and then I\u0027d remark on how easily you have forgotten Bidworth.\"In the space of an afternoon. Inconstant woman. Her eyes narrowed at his words, but she didn\u0027t offer an answer. Not even ashow of loyalty. And to think Hugh had worried that he might have to see her pine for the man. Hugh wouldn\u0027t want a woman like Jane, even if he could have her. Didn\u0027t matter. He was only here to protect her, and her games would get in the way. In a deadly calm tone, he said, \"I\u0027ve given you warning. You know what will happen.\" She made no move to cover herself. This was just another battle of wills with her. Yet another. But he wasn\u0027t the same compromising lad he\u0027d been. Couldn\u0027t be, even if he wanted to be. The things he\u0027d seen had changed him. The things he\u0027d done had tainted him. He\u0027d killed with his bare hands. He shot to his feet and crossed to her, tossing her onto the table. He\u0027d only planned to stand before her and yank her wrap up, yet he found himself grabbing her slender arms, pinning them to her sides. He could still back away; why was he drawing closer? No good can come of this.Because he was a hardened killer, obsessed for the last decade with an inconstant woman. One who loved to provoke him. A woman he could not touch, specifically because he\u0027d married her.No good... She seemed to wait breathlessly to discover what he would do. Hugh had no idea either. When he eased his hips between her thighs, she began trembling. He was learning that her skin was sensitive, her entire body so damned responsive.Taking her would be like handling a firebrand. What if he sought to make love to her, and shelet him? He swallowed hard, his breaths coming fast from the mere thought. To finally possess her. With a defeated groan, he leaned forward to briefly catch her sensitive earlobe between his lips, flicking it with his tongue. She hissed in a breath and shivered. With one hand flat on the small of her back, he tugged at her hair with the other, making her arch till she rested back with her elbows on the table. Dazed with intent, he leaned down to press his mouth to her silk-covered nipple. Chapter Eighteen As Hugh moved his lips down her breast, he rasped harsh words in Gaelic against her skin, seeming lost, as if he was so absorbed in what he did that he truly had no comprehension of it. She threaded her fingers through his hair, cradling him to her as she sighed with pleasure. Thiswas what she was missing with Freddie. And, no, she couldnot live without it. It wasn\u0027t only that he\u0027d made her desire him; she sensed heneeded her, or needed something from her. She was desperate to give him whatever that was. Thoughts of the future and memories of the past all dimmed before the hunger she\u0027d seen in his eyes. Still gently tugging her hair to make her arch, he nuzzled her hard nipple, rasping against it, \"Damn it, you\u0027re supposed tae tell me tae stop.\" After a hesitation, he closed his mouth over the aching peak, then began languidly circling his tongue around it. \"Oh, my God,\" she whispered in wonder. He glanced up, eyes dark, measuring her responses, studying her. \"You like that?\" At her helpless cry, he moved to her other breast. \"You think that I\u0027ll react the same way to your teasing as I did years ago.\" He repeated the same tender exploration, saying against her breast, \"You\u0027re going to push until I finally break.\" \"B-but in the past - \" \"In the past, I was young and honorable. Now I\u0027m old enough to know what I need and dishonorable enough\" - he softly tugged on her nipple with his teeth, making her gasp and arch harder into his mouth - \"to take it.\" \"Hugh,\" she murmured, \"Hugh, please.\" \"Do you want me to take it, lass? Push me more, and you\u0027ll soon feel me sinking into your soft body.\" He pulled back, met her eyes. Whatever he saw there made him recoil from her. Stabbing his fingers through his hair, he opened his mouth, then closed it. Finally, he bit out, \"Stay here. Lock the door behind me and doona leave this room.\" \"Why?\" she whispered. \"I never thought you would be like this,\" he grated. \"No\u0027 with me.\" Then he stalked out and slammed the door behind him. She wasn\u0027t supposed to be likewhat with him?How was she wrong? He remained outside, leaning against the door. He would have to wait there before going downstairs - she\u0027d seen his thick erection bulging against his trousers and knew he\u0027d have to get his body under control. Hers was just as ungovernable. As Jane sat panting on the edge of the dinner table, a fork parallel to her thigh and a glass of wine perilously close to the hand she\u0027d thrown back to support her, she realized something dire. The kiss in the carriage hadn\u0027t been an anomaly. She and Hugh were going to be like this every time they were together. She\u0027d known Hugh would be a skilled lover - he was accomplished at everything he did, and whenever he\u0027d assisted her from a carriage or into her saddle, he\u0027d handled her as if she were made of glass. But she\u0027d never imagined that the towering Highlander would be so...erotic. He\u0027d made herburn for him, made her wet and aching between her thighs. Again. His kisses were slow and devilish, his lips firm and carnal. Could he guess that his threat to, oh, dear Lord,sink into her soft body , made her yearn for him even more? She\u0027d almost cried, \"Yes, do it!\" She thought he hit something outside their room, then she heard him finally leave. She hadn\u0027t wanted to charm and cajole Hugh into staying married, because she knew that he likely would leave her behind again, married in truth or no. And she\u0027d been so angry with him for putting her in the position to be hurt all over again, and had vowed that she would protect herstill raw emotions. Now she reasoned that they were both hurting at this moment. Though she didn\u0027t want tostay married to him - she hadn\u0027t wavered that much - she didn\u0027t want to be separated from him right now. Not so soon. She half-expected him to disappear for another ten years, and wasn\u0027t nearly ready for that to happen again. Get him back here.... Give him what he needs. Decided, she smoothed her gown, pulled her wrapper closed, downed a glass of wine in one unladylike gulp, then made for the door. She glanced out, but he wasn\u0027t on the landing. Looking both ways, she hurried down the landing and peeked over the railing, down into the boisterous common room. Hugh sat at a table draining some liquid, his hand white from clenching the mug. She exhaled in relief. She wasn\u0027t alone in this feeling - she\u0027d affected him just as much as he had her. Perhaps he\u0027d never returned for her because of his dangerous occupation. Her eyes widened. Perhaps he\u0027d always wanted to but couldn\u0027t - Her lips parted when she saw Lysette saunter up to him, draping her arm around him. The woman drew in close, whispering something in Hugh\u0027s ear as she ran her hand up and down his back. He pushed her away, but Jane saw to her shock and horror that he did so only to follow Lysette to a back room.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/if-you-desire-maccarrick-brothers-2/page-9.html","bookId":2645,"book":{"id":2645,"title":"If You Desire (MacCarrick Brothers #2)","description":"Storyline: If You Desire (MacCarrick Brothers #2) How much temptation can a Highlander resist?
