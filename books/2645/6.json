{"id":103666,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"Chapter Eleven\\n\\n Never! Never on your life....\\n\\n With Jane\u0027s words running through his mind, Hugh rode for Grosvenor Square in a daze. There\u0027d been too many developments this morning for him to digest. Simply seeing her kissing another man had nearly been his undoing.\\n\\n And then, after so many years of fighting to stay away from Jane, to be forced to be with her - no, to marry her. He was shocked at how badly part of him wanted Weyland to succeed in persuading her.\\n\\n Even as Hugh knew he couldn\u0027t keep her.\\n\\n Did I truly just see Jane kissing another man?\\n\\n When he arrived at the square, Hugh strode inside the MacCarrick family\u0027s mansion. They all called this place \"the family\u0027s,\" though in truth it now belonged to Ethan. As the oldest son, Ethan had inherited all of the MacCarrick properties, as well as the Scottish earldom of Kavanagh - though he would likely pummel anyone who dared remind him he was a peer.\\n\\n In the entry hall, Hugh ignored, as usual, his mother\u0027s messages to him, lying in the silver tray. He couldn\u0027t say he hated the woman, but she\u0027d blamed her sons for their father\u0027s death, and that made it damned difficult to want anything to do with her. His brothers felt the same. All her messages to them were unopened as well.\\n\\n Ethan hadn\u0027t banned her from the property, yet. By tacit agreement, she never stayed here when any of her sons were in London, though Hugh would bet she was still bribing the servants for information about them - everyone but Erskine, their butler. The dour-faced man was committed to his job of discouraging any and all visitors, and loyal down to his bones.\\n\\n Hugh strode directly to the study, his boots drumming across the marble floor. He knew precisely where theLeabhar nan S¨´il-radharc, the Book of Fates, would be - still laid out on the long mahogany desk, where Hugh had found Courtland, staring at it almost pleadingly just weeks ago.\\n\\n As always, Hugh was amazed that such an ancient book could be preserved so well after countless years had passed. Of course, the only marking it had ever accepted was blood.\\n\\n Long ago, a clan seer had predicted the fates of ten generations of MacCarricks and inscribed them in theLeabhar . The lines within foretold tragedies and triumphs that had all come to pass.\\n\\n Although Hugh had long since memorized it, he turned to the last page, written to his father...\\n\\n To the tenth Carrick:\\n\\n Your lady fair shall bear you three dark sons.\\n\\n Joy they bring you until they read this tome.\\n\\n Words before their eyes cut your life\u0027s line young.\\n\\n You die dread knowing cursed men they become, shadowed to walk with death or walk alone.\\n\\n Not to marry, know love, or bind, their fate;\\n\\n Your line to die for never seed shall take.\\n\\n Death and torment to those caught in their wake...\\n\\n The last two lines were obscured by dried blood that could not be lifted from the page.\\n\\n Tragedies and triumphs revealed? Hugh exhaled wearily. No triumphs were revealed to the brothers. No, they had sired no bairns among them, had killed their father by reading this very book, and continued to hurt everything they cared for.\\n\\n Running his forefinger down the prediction on the crisp parchment, he felt his skin grow cold and clammy. There was something innate there, some palpable power in theLeabhar . The last person from outside the family who\u0027d touched it had stared at it in horror and crossed himself.\\n\\n Hugh turned away in disgust, then made his way to his bedroom. He forced himself to pack, though he wasn\u0027t convinced that Weyland could in fact move Jane to this measure, short of blackmail -\\n\\n \"What the bloody hell are you doing?\" Ethan barked from the doorway. He glared at Hugh, who was dragging clothing from his wardrobe to a leather travel bag.\\n\\n \"Leaving London.\"\\n\\n \"Withher ?\"\\n\\n \"Aye. Weyland\u0027s asked me to...wed her and take her away.\" His tone was defensive.\\n\\n \"No\u0027 again!\" Ethan\u0027s scar was whitening. \"We just got Courtland\u0027s woman away from him. Now you\u0027re running off with yours?\"\\n\\n \"And what of you?\" Hugh countered, snatching up shirts. \"I think you showed more interest in that girl last night than I\u0027ve ever seen you show another woman.\"\\n\\n \"Ah, but I merely played with my wee blonde.\" He rubbed his scar unconsciously. Did he hate it anew after last night? Or had the chit slapped his face? Hugh hoped the latter. \"But you and Court are always wanting more.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve agreed to wed Jane - temporarily. And only to take her away until you capture Grey and the havoc caused by the list dies down. I\u0027ve made it clear to Weyland that this marriage will be annulled at that time, and he understood.\"\\n\\n Ethan was shaking his head. \"You\u0027re no\u0027 thinking clearly. You took one look at her after all that time away and bloody lost your mind. And the clan calls you the reasonable one?\"\\n\\n \"Iam reasonable,\" he grated, punching shirts into his bag so hard that the stitches in the leather strained.\\n\\n \"Running off with the woman you\u0027ve been lost for, tomarry her? Temporarily? Aye, the example of reason you are,\" Ethan sneered. \"My God, you lectured Court about this verra thing. Rightly so.\"\\n\\n Hugh glanced away. He\u0027d beensmug when he\u0027d lectured Court, smug that he\u0027d had the discipline to stay away from Jane all these years.\\n\\n \"Hugh, how can you ignore what\u0027s happened? Court made up his mind to marry Annal¨ªa, and within days, a bullet almost splattered her brain across our front doorstep. And then me. Have you forgotten my fianc¨¦e? It wasyou who found Sarah\u0027s broken body. Would you expose Jane to a fate like that?\"\\n\\n Christ, no. Never.\"I will no\u0027 consummate the marriage. I will no\u0027keep her,\" he said in a low tone. \"It will no\u0027 be a marriage in truth. Besides, I\u0027vealready jeopardized her. Grey will seize on her because of me. I know this. Grey will definitely kill her without me to protect her. Imight hurt her.\"\\n\\n \"Even ill in the head, Grey will be deadly. As much as I hate to say it, he has unmatchable instincts.\" Ethan caught his gaze. \"Why do you no\u0027 let me take Jane away?\"\\n\\n The thought made Hugh\u0027s blood boil. \"Grey will never harm her while I live. Mark me, Ethan. Never.\"\\n\\n Ethan raised his eyebrows. \"Then you\u0027d better hope I get to him before he gets to her. You think to protect her when you\u0027re no\u0027 cold about this? Certainly no\u0027 cold like Grey is. You\u0027re going to get both yourself and the girl killed.\"\\n\\n \"Damn it, I can take care of her - \"\\n\\n \"Andkeep your hands off her at the same time?\" Ethan gave him an incredulous expression.\\n\\n \"I have discipline. You ken that I do.\" Hugh strode to his wardrobe for a few essentials - a pistol as backup to the one he always wore holstered, and another rifle, second to the one he kept in his saddle holster. He also packed a good deal of ammunition for all of the weapons. \"And I\u0027ve stayed away this long, have I no\u0027?\"\\n\\n \"I also know you\u0027ve got years of want stored up. You might seem calm on the outside, but I\u0027ll bet inside you\u0027re seething with it.\"\\n\\n Seething. The perfect word for how he felt. \"Does no\u0027 matter. She hates me.\"Especially after this morning. \"Hell, she\u0027ll probably balk.\" Though he wondered. Weyland always got what he wanted. But then, so did Jane. Surely Weyland couldn\u0027t want him as a son-in-law as much as Jane wanted to have nothing to do with him. \"I will no\u0027 keep her,\" he insisted again. \"And she will no\u0027 want me.\"\\n\\n Ethan studied him for long moments. Then he exhaled a resigned breath. \"Aye, then. That, I can accept. Even if the old man forces her to wed, the chit will want out at the first opportunity.\"\\n\\n Hugh scowled at Ethan\u0027s tone. As if he were reciting a fact.\\n\\n \"Is it so bloody inconceivable that she might want me as I want her?\"\\n\\n Ethan simply said, \"Aye.\"\\n\\n Hugh snatched up his bag, then exited the room to stomp down the stairs.\\n\\n \"Where\u0027re you taking her?\" Ethan asked, following. \"No\u0027 to the clan?\"\\n\\n Hugh shook his head. He\u0027d considered taking her to Carrickliffe, but the people there all knew about the curse. At best, they would be wary around Jane, superstitious and treating her as though she were doomed. At worst, they would try to spirit her away from Hugh, seeking to save them both. He would only go there if there was no other alternative. \"I\u0027m taking her north to Ros Creag.\"\\n\\n \"Does Grey know about the lake house?\"\\n\\n \"I never told him about it, but I canna be certain whether he does,\" Hugh answered. \"If he hasn\u0027t reached England and I only keep us there for a few days - \"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m fast, but I\u0027m no\u0027 that fast.\"\\n\\n As Hugh reached the front door, he said, \"Any suggestions among your various hideaways?\"\\n\\n \"Grey knows of several, and I canna swear by the rest. You should take her to Court\u0027s.\"\\n\\n Hugh slowed. He hadn\u0027t thought of Court\u0027s property, probably because his brother had owned it for so short a time.\\n\\n \"Court said the keep was old, but it\u0027s solid and only needs a bit of work,\" Ethan said.\\n\\n He\u0027d told Hugh the same, and that it was in the middle ofthousands of acres. \"I\u0027ll go to Ros Creag, and if I haven\u0027t heard anything from you in five days, we\u0027ll journey north to Court\u0027s.\"\\n\\n \"Good. I\u0027ll alert the staff to your arrival,\" Ethan said, referring to the skeleton staff that lived just off the property.\\n\\n \"If Grey follows us, I hope to God you\u0027ll be following him.\" Hugh skewered his brother with a look. \"Much is in your hands, and you canna afford to get distracted. The sooner you kill Grey, the sooner this marriage is annulled.\"\\n\\n \"Then doona get settled in,\" Ethan said with a chilling smile. \"And best take care with the marks on your face. You doona want them to scar.\"\\n\\n \"Go to hell,\" Hugh bit out, opening the door.\\n\\n Ethan cursed under his breath, then said, \"Wait a minute.\" He strode off, returning with theLeabhar , and offered it to Hugh. \"Take it. It will remind you as nothing else can.\"\\n\\n Hugh accepted the weighty book. \"And what about you? What if you need it?\"\\n\\n Ethan\u0027s face was perfectly cold. \"I\u0027ve no heart to be tempted, remember?\"\\n\\n Hugh narrowed his eyes. \"What did you do to the girl last night?\"\\n\\n He smirked, reaching up to rest his hand on top of the door. \"Nothing she dinna want me to.\"\\n\\n \"Quin said she\u0027d been afraid.\"\\n\\n Ethan\u0027s brows drew together. \"No. I dinnascare her.\" He touched his scar for the second time - something henever did. Either he\u0027d never wanted to remember the injury, or had never wanted to draw attention to the mark. But this morning, he\u0027d been mindful of it for the first time in years. \"Goddamn it, I bloody had a mask on.\"\\n\\n Hugh didn\u0027t think this was a good time to point out that his bearing and demeanor were as disturbing as his face. \"Do you know who she is?\"\\n\\n \"Was going by Quin\u0027s today to find out,\" Ethan drawled, \"but now I find my calendar filled. Did you find out her name from Jane?\"\\n\\n Hugh saw an eagerness in his brother\u0027s eyes that gave him pause. Though Hugh didn\u0027t have the full details, he knew that Geoffrey Van Rowen was somehow responsible for Ethan\u0027s scar. Hugh also knew that the injury to Ethan\u0027s face had been deliberately delivered in a manner that ensured it would never heal seamlessly.\\n\\n In turn, Ethan\u0027s revenge had been protracted and ruthless - and not particularly discerning between those in the Van Rowen family who deserved it, and those who didn\u0027t.\\n\\n Hadn\u0027t he done enough to them?\\n\\n Perhaps Ethan would lose interest in her over the coming days. \"I know she\u0027s a friend of Jane\u0027s, so doona hurt that lass, Ethan, or you\u0027ll answer to me.\" He stuffed theLeabhar into his bag.\\n\\n Ethan\u0027s cold expression turned menacing. \"You think you can stop me if I feel like amusing myself? Go to hell, Hugh. You\u0027re smug about this subject, too,\" Ethan said. \"But if you get Jane killed, you\u0027ll find you have a lot in common with me. Brother, you\u0027ll end upjust like me .\"\\n\\n Hugh cast him a disgusted look before turning away. As Ethan shut the door behind him, Hugh thought he heard him mutter, \"Just doona end up like me....\"\\n\\n Chapter Twelve\\n\\n Though well over an hour had passed by the time Hugh returned to the Weylands\u0027, their muffled argument was still going strong in the study, so he sank down into a chair outside the room. He let his aching head fall back against the wall while he anxiously brushed his fingers over the small case in his jacket pocket.\\n\\n Everything in Ridergate\u0027s whisper-quiet shop had appeared breakable to a man of Hugh\u0027s size, and he\u0027d wanted to pull at his collar the entire time he was there. But when Hugh had found just the ring for her, he hadn\u0027t hesitated to spend a small fortune on it. What else was he going to spend his money on, if not her?\\n\\n He\u0027d known what to buy her because, that last summer, she\u0027d told him exactly what she dreamed of receiving from her future bridegroom: \"A gold ring with emeraldsand an enormous diamond in the middle. It should be so heavy, I\u0027ll be forever knocking it into things, breaking shopkeepers\u0027 counters and accidentally unmanning pedestrians.\"\\n\\n They\u0027d been floating in a rowboat, her head in his lap as he played with her silky hair, fascinated as he lifted it to the sunlight, but he\u0027d frozen at her words, tensing with anxiety. As a second son, he\u0027d had no money to speak of and could never afford anything remotely like what she\u0027d described.\\n\\n Then he\u0027d remembered that he could never have her anyway....\\n\\n Now, years later, he stared at the ceiling as round and round his mind played out the same scenarios and consequences.\\n\\n Far too early in life, he\u0027d learned about consequences, both avoidable and unavoidable.\\n\\n The morning after he and his brothers had found and read theLeabhar - which was thought to have been destroyed - Hugh had woken to his mother\u0027s screams. She\u0027d discovered her husband, Leith, the clan laird and a bear of a man in his prime, cold and dead in their bed.\\n\\n And then she\u0027d shrieked her blame. Hugh had been nigh on fourteen, far too young to be saddled with that guilt.\\n\\n Years later, Ethan had scoffed at the curse, calling their father\u0027s death a freak coincidence, and found a bride from the neighboring MacReedy clan who would actually dare to wed a \"cursed MacCarrick son.\" Sarah had fallen - or, as most believed, had been pushed by Ethan - from a turret at Carrickliffe.\\n\\n Then Court had lost his heart to a foreign lass and intended to marry her, though he knew that he could never give her children and would only bring her misery.\\n\\n Court had been defiant, daring to challenge their fate - until his Annal¨ªa had been a breath away from being shot in the head. Court had finally left her behind, safe at her home in Andorra, though it had nearly killed him. She\u0027d become his entire world.\\n\\n Consequences.The lines within that book said Hugh was not to marry or to bind. Hugh worked to convince himself there was a difference betweenmarried andwed .\\n\\n Damn it, there would be no sealed union. If Jane agreed, they would be wed, but not truly bound together. As long as he didn\u0027t claim her, she\u0027d be safe. Surely. And God knew, he had no intentions of keeping her.\\n\\n He stood when Jane came out five minutes later, her eyes bright with either unshed tears or fury. A good wager said the latter.\\n\\n What\u0027s it to be, then? What\u0027s the verdict?\\n\\n Weyland was right behind her. \"I\u0027ll just go send a note to the minister and pick up the marriage license. Jane, you need to begin packing immediately.\"\\n\\n Then Weyland was gone, leaving Hugh so dumbfounded he nearly rocked on his feet. \"You\u0027re going tae...\" he began, but his voice broke lower. \"We\u0027re tae...marry?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, I am constrained to agree to this insanity - you are not. And you will ruin my life if you don\u0027t refuse to do this for him.\" Turmoil and emotion rolled off her in waves. She\u0027d always been like that - volatile, like an explosive. Yet no one but Hugh seemed to understand just howcomplicated Jane was.\\n\\n So Weyland had succeeded. Hugh hadn\u0027t expected her to be happy about the nuptials, but...\"A temporary marriage to me counts as a ruined life?\"\\n\\n Every word she spoke was clipped with her proper English accent, and dripping with outrage. \"Do you knowwhy I was with Frederick Bidworth - LordWhiting - this morning?\" She answered her own question, \"Because I was accepting his soddingproposal today!\"\\n\\n Hugh\u0027s vision swam. But why should he be surprised? He\u0027d wondered as each month went by, for years, why she hadn\u0027t married.Wait. How had Weyland not known about this? He had to have. She was about to be \"settled\" without any interference from them.\\n\\n Bloody hell. This just kept getting better. Hugh had wanted to kill Bidworth for kissing Jane - whom the man had thought was his.\\n\\n \"However, my plans were interrupted when youattacked Freddie.\"\\n\\n Jane was within her rights to be kissing her soon-to-be fianc¨¦. Just because Hugh could think of naught but her didn\u0027t mean she was affected the same way by him. She\u0027d had a life of her own these last years, and Hugh had just been dropped in the middle of it, swinging as he landed. \"You were about to accept an earl, yet your father is still insisting on me?\" It was a genuine question, but she took it as a retort and glared at him.\\n\\n \"Why, Hugh? Why is Davis Grey doing this? You know him - is he truly so dangerous that I have to flee my home?\" Her face was drawn with confusion. \"Why is Father so set onyou ? Did he blackmail you into this as well? Of course he did. Why else would you agree to such a lunatic idea?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve no\u0027 been blackmailed, but I have promised your father. Just cooperate with me. The arrangement will no\u0027 be permanent as long as we doona...consummate the marriage.\" He lowered his voice. \"Rest easy, this is temporary. I have no intention of remaining married any more than you do. And you know that if I dinna touch you before, then you\u0027re safe from it now.\"\\n\\n \"As if I\u0027d let you,\" she hissed.\\n\\n He pinched the bridge of his nose. His head was throbbing, his neck knotted with tension, but he tried to calm his tone. His ire never daunted Jane. \"Did you ever think that this is no\u0027 something I want either?\"\\n\\n No, he didn\u0027t want this, was never supposed to marry. But now that he\u0027d seen her once more, he didn\u0027t want anyone else to wed her either. And he was just selfish enough to agree to Weyland\u0027s machinations. Her father knew what was best for her, he reasoned, and Weyland had chosen Hugh. \"Jane, I dinna come here thinking I\u0027d leave with a bride.\"\\n\\n \"Then why did you tell Papa tosee it done ?\"\\n\\n \"Because I can protect you.\"\\n\\n She advanced until she was toe to toe with him, unflinching as she raised her face to his. \"If you do this, Hugh, you have no idea how much I\u0027ll make you regret it. I\u0027m giving you fair warning right now to desist from this.\"\\n\\n When he said nothing, making his expression unbending, her lips parted in disbelief.\\n\\n \"Resolved, are we? Then so must I be.\" She made her tone soft when she asked, \"Hugh, do you remember when I used to tease you?\"\\n\\n As if he could ever,ever forget.\\n\\n \"Darling, you\u0027re going to find that I\u0027ve gotten better at it.\" She walked her fingers up his chest, and her voice grew breathless. \"You\u0027ll see that I\u0027ve gathered new arrows...in my quiver.\" Somehow she made that phrase sound wicked, and the customary sweat beaded on his brow.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve made it clear that you don\u0027t want this marriage,\" she said. \"So before you go forward with this madness, consider - how much can you resist...day after day?\"\\n\\n He swallowed.\\n\\n \"Prepare yourself, darling.\" She turned, sauntering up the stairs with a hip-swinging gait that drew his riveted gaze. Over her shoulder, she said, \"Because I\u0027m about to make your life a living hell.\" Disappearing into her room, she slammed her door.\\n\\n \"More of the same,\" he muttered, wondering if his wedding might go smoother than his engagement. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/if-you-desire-maccarrick-brothers-2/page-6.html","bookId":2645,"book":{"id":2645,"title":"If You Desire (MacCarrick Brothers #2)","description":"Storyline: If You Desire (MacCarrick Brothers #2) \\n How much temptation can a Highlander resist?
