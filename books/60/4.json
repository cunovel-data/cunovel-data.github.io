{"id":1858,"no":4,"title":"A Patch-Work Screen FOR THE LADIES. LEAF II.","content":"It was not long after these Turns of Fortune, that I had the real Affliction of losing my dear and indulgent Father; and so was left the only Consolation of my widow\u0027d Mother. I shall not mention the Grief, Care, and Trouble which attended this great Change; these Things being natural and known to every-body: Therefore, I shall pass them over in Silence, as I was forced to undergo it with Submission. \n \n When our Griefs were a little compos\u0027d, and our Affairs adjusted, so that the World knew what Fortune I had to depend upon, and that in my own Power, there wanted not Pretenders to my Person; so that now was the Time to act the Coquet, if I had lik\u0027d the Scene; but that never was my Inclination; for as I never affected the formal Prude, so I ever scorn\u0027d the impertinent Coquet. Amongst this Train of Pretenders, (some of which address\u0027d to my Mother, and some privately to me) I think there is nothing worth Remark, but what your Ladyship may guess, by a Copy or two of Verses writ on these Occasions. \n To my Indifferent Lover, who complain\u0027d of my Indifferency. \n \n You\u0027d little Reason to complain of me, \n \n Or my Unkindness, or Indifferency, \n \n Since I, by many a Circumstance, can prove, \n \n That Int\u0027rest was the Motive of your Love. \n \n But Heav\u0027n it-self despises that Request, \n \n Whose sordid Motive\u0027s only Interest. \n \n No more can honest Maids endure to be \n \n The Objects of your wise Indifferency. \n \n Such wary Courtship only shou\u0027d be shown \n \n To cunning, jilting Baggages o\u0027th\u0027 Town. \n \n \u0027Tis faithful Love\u0027s the Rhetorick that persuades, \n \n And charms the Hearts of silly Country Maids. \n \n But when we find, your Courtship\u0027s but Pretence, \n \n Love were not Love in us, but Impudence. \n \n At best, I\u0027m sure, to us it needs must prove, \n \n What e\u0027er you think on\u0027t, most injurious Love. \n \n For had I of that gentle Nature been, \n \n As to have lov\u0027d your Person, Wit, or Mien, \n \n How many Sighs \u0026 Tears it wou\u0027d have cost, \n \n And fruitless Expectations by the Post? \n \n Saying, He is unkind. — O no! his Letter\u0027s lost; \n \n Hoping him sick, or lame, or gone to Sea; \n \n Hop\u0027d any thing but his Inconstancy. \n \n Thus, what in other Friends, cause greatest Fear, \n \n To desperate Maids, their only Comforts are. \n \n This I through all your Blandishments did see, \n \n Thanks to Ill-Nature, that instructed me. \n \n Thoughts of your Sighs, sometimes wou\u0027d plead for you; \n \n But Second Thoughts again wou\u0027d let me know, \n \n In gayest Serpents strongest Poysons are, \n \n As sweetest Rose-trees, sharpest Prickles bear. \n \n And so it proves, since now it does appear, \n \n That all your Flames and Sighs only for Money were. \n \n As Beggars for their Gain, turn blind and lame, \n \n On the same score, a Lover you became. \n \n Yet there\u0027s a Kindness in this feign\u0027d Amour, \n \n It teaches me, ne\u0027er to believe Man more: \n \n Thus blazing Comets are of good Portent, \n \n When they excite the People to repent. \n \n These Amours affected me but little, or rather not at all; For the Troubles of the World lighting upon me, a thousand Disappointments attended me, when deprived of my Father. Alas! we know not the real Worth of indulgent, tender Parents, \u0027till the Want of them teach us by a sad Experience: And none experienc\u0027d this more than myself: deceitful Debtors, impatient Creditors, distress\u0027d Friends, peevish Enemies, Law-suits, rotten Houses, Eye-servants, spightful Neighbours, impertinent and interested Lovers, with a thousand such Things to terrify and vex me, nothing to consolate or assist me, but Patience and God\u0027s Providence. \n \n When my Mother and I had accommodated our Affairs, we endeavour\u0027d to make ourselves easy, by putting off our Country Incumbrance, and so went to live at London. \n \n Here I was, as if I was born again: This was a new Life to me, and very little fitted the Shape of my Rural Fancy; for I was wholly form\u0027d to the Country in Mind and Manners; as unfit for the Town, as a Tarpaulin for a States-man; the Town to me was a Wilderness, where, methought, I lost my self and my Time; and what the World there calls Diversion, to me was Confusion. The Park, Plays, and Operas, were to me but as so much Time thrown away. I was a Stranger to every-body, and their Way of Living; and, I believe, my stiff Air and awkard Mien, made every-body wish to remain a Stranger to me. The Assemblèes, Ombre, and Basset-Tables, were all Greek to me; and I believe my Country Dialect, to them, was as unintelligible; so that we were neither serviceable nor pleasant to each other. Perhaps some or other of the Company, either out of Malice to expose me, or Complaisance to entertain me in my own Way, would enter into the Praise of a Country Life, and its plentiful Way of Living, amongst our Corn, Dairies, and Poultry, \u0027till by Degrees, these bright Angels would make the Ass open its Mouth, and upon their Demand, tell how many Pounds of Butter a good Cow would make in a Week; or how many Bushels of Wheat a good Acre of Land would produce; Things quite out of their Sphere or Element: And amongst the rest, the Decay of the Wooll-Trade is not to be omitted; and, like a true Country Block-head, grumble against the Parliament, for taking no better Care of the Country-Trade, by prohibiting Cane-Chairs and Wainscot; by which means, the Turkey-work, Tapistry, and Kidderminster Trades were quite lost; and in them the great Manufacture of the Nation; and not only so, but perpetual Fires intail\u0027d on the City of London. Thus I, one of the free-born People of England, thought I had full Privilege to rail at my Betters. Sometimes, and in some Places, perhaps, Part of the Company, who knew a little of my Bookish Inclinations, would endeavour to relieve that Silence which the Ignorance of the Town laid upon me; and enter into a Discourse of Receipts, Books, and Reading. One ask\u0027d me, If I lik\u0027d Mrs. Phillips, or Mrs. Behn best? To whom I reply\u0027d, with a blunt Indignation, That they ought not to be nam\u0027d together: And so, in an unthinking, unmannerly Way, reproach\u0027d the Lady that endeavour\u0027d to divert and entertain me; she having that Moment been pleased to couple them. By this Blunder, Madam, said Galesia, you see how far one is short, in Conversation acquired only by Reading; for the many Plays and pretty Books I had read, stood me in little stead at that Time, to my great Confusion; for though Reading inriches the Mind, yet it is Conversation that inables us to use and apply those Riches or Notions gracefully. \n \n At the Toilet, I was as ignorant a Spectator as a Lady is an Auditor at an Act-Sermon in the University, which is always in Latin; for I was not capable to distinguish which Dress became which Face; or whether the Italian, Spanish, or Portugal Red, best suited such or such Features; nor had I a Catalogue of the Personal or Moral Defects of such or such Ladies, or Knowledge of their Gallantries, whereby to make my Court to the Present, at the Cost of the Absent; and so to go the World round, \u0027till I got thereby the Reputation of ingaging and agreeable Company. However, it was not often that the whole Mystery of the Toilet, was reveal\u0027d to my Country Capacity; but now and then some Aunt, or Governess, would call me to a Dish of Chocolate, or so; whilst the Lady and her officious Madamoiselle, were putting on those secret Imbellishments which illustrated her Beauties in the Eyes of most of the fine bred Beholders. But some petulant, antiquated Tempers, despised such Ornaments, as not having been used in good Queen Bess\u0027s Days; nor yet in the more Modern Court of Oliver Cromwel. As to myself, I was like a Wild Ass in a Forest, and liv\u0027d alone in the midst of this great Multitude, even the great and populous City of London. \n \n When Duty and good Days call\u0027d me to Church, I thought I might find there some Compeeresses, or Persons of my own Stamp, and amongst the Congregation behave my self like others of my Sex and Years; But, alas! there were Locks and Keys, Affronts from Pew-keepers, crowding and pushing by the Mob, and the gathering Congregation gazing upon me as a Monster; at least I fancied so. When patient waiting, and Pocket opening to the Pewkeeper, had got me a Place, I thought to exercise the Duty that call\u0027d me thither: But, alas! the Curtesies, the Whispers, the Grimaces, the Pocket Glasses, Ogling, Sighing, Flearing, Glancing, with a long \u0026c. so discompos\u0027d my Thoughts, that I found I was as unfit for those Assemblies, as those others before nam\u0027d, where a verbal Conversation provided against those mute Entertainments; which my Clownish Breeding made me think great Indecencies in that Sacred Place; where nothing ought to be thought on, much less acted, but what tended to Devotion, and God\u0027s Glory; so that I was here likewise alone in the midst of a great Congregation. Thus you see, Madam, how an Education, purely Country, renders one unfit to live in the great World, amongst People of refin\u0027d and nice Breeding; and though I had bestow\u0027d Time and Pains in Book-Acquests, a little more than usual; yet it was but lost Labour to say the best of it: However, I did not repent; for though it had suppress\u0027d and taken Place of that nice Conversation belonging to the Ladies, yet it furnish\u0027d me with Notions above the Trifles of my Sex, wherewith to entertain my self in Solitude; and likewise, when Age and Infirmities confin\u0027d my dear Mother within-doors, and very much to her Chamber, I paid my Duty to her with Pleasure, which otherwise might have seem\u0027d a Constraint, if not in some Degree omitted, had my Thoughts been levell\u0027d at those gaudy Pleasures of the Town, which intangle and intoxicate the greater Part of Woman-kind. Now, I believe, it was this retired Temper which pleas\u0027d a certain Person a little in Years, so as to make his Addresses to me, in order to an Espousal. This was approv\u0027d of by my Friends and Relations; amongst the rest, my young Kinsman, whom I mention\u0027d to your Ladyship, a Student at the University, writ me a very fine persuasive Copy of Verses on the Subject of Marriage, which I have lost; but the Answer to those Verses appear here amongst the other Paper-Rubbish. \n To my Friend EXILIUS, On his persuading me to marry Old Damon. \n \n When Friends Advice with Lovers Forces joyn, \n \n They conquer Hearts more fortified than mine. \n \n Mine open lies, without the least Defence; \n \n No Guard of Art; but its own Innocence; \n \n Under which Fort it could fierce Storms endure: \n \n But from thy Wit I find no Fort secure. \n \n Ah! why would\u0027st thou assist mine Enemy, \n \n Whose Merits were almost too strong for me? \n \n For now thy Wit makes me almost adore, \n \n And ready to pronounce him Conqueror: \n \n But that his Kindness then would grow, I fear, \n \n Too weighty for my weak Desert to bear: \n \n I fear \u0027twou\u0027d even to Extreams improve; \n \n For Jealousy, they say\u0027s th\u0027 Extream of Love. \n \n Even Thou, my dear Exilius, he\u0027d suspect; \n \n If I but look on thee, I him neglect. \n \n Not only Men, as innocent as thou, \n \n But Females he\u0027d mistrust, and Heaven too. \n \n Thus best things may be turn\u0027d to greatest Harm, \n \n As the Lord\u0027s Prayer said backward, proves a Charm. \n \n Or if not thus, I\u0027m sure he wou\u0027d despise, \n \n And under-rate the easy-gotten Prize, \n \n Forgetting the Portent o\u0027th\u0027 willing Sacrifice. \n \n ???These and a thousand Fears my Soul possess; \n \n But most of all my own Unworthiness: \n \n Like dying Saints, that wish for coming Joys, \n \n But humble Fears their forward Wish destroys. \n \n What shall I do, then? Hazard the Event? \n \n You say, old Damon\u0027s All that\u0027s excellent. \n \n If I miss him, the next some \u0027Squire may prove, \n \n Whose Dogs and Horses, shall have all his Love. \n \n Or some debauch\u0027d Pretender to lewd Wit, \n \n Or covetous, conceited, unbred Cit. \n \n As the brave Horse, who late in Coach did neigh, \n \n Is forc\u0027d at last to tug a nasty Dray. \n \n I suppose, I need not desire your Ladyship to believe, that what seems here to be said in Favour of Damon, is rather Respect to my Kinsman\u0027s Persuasions, than any real Affection for him; who being a little in Years, was not much capable of raising a Passion in a Heart not hospitable enough to receive a Guest of this kind; especially having found so much Trouble with those that had lodg\u0027d there heretofore. Wherefore this Affair pass\u0027d by, with Indifferency on both Sides: And my Mother and I remain\u0027d at Quiet, we not thinking of any-body; nor any-body thinking of us: And thus we liv\u0027d alone (at least in our Actions) in the midst of Multitudes. \n \n Our Lodging was near Westminster-Abbey, for the Benefit of those frequent and regular Services there performed. For my own Part, I chose the early Prayers, as being free from that Coquettry, too much appearing at the usual Hour: Besides, there one has the Opportunity, to offer all the Accitions of the Day to Heaven, as the First-fruits, which heretofore was a most acceptable Sacrifice. By this, methought, all the Actions of the following Day were sanctified; or, at least, they seem\u0027d to be agitated by a Direction from Heaven. The Comers thither appear\u0027d to me to resort really there about what they pretended; and the Service of God seem\u0027d to be the true Motive of their Actions. But, good Heaven! how was I surpriz\u0027d at a Transaction I will relate, though not appertaining to my-self or my Story. \n \n There was an elderly Man, in a graceful comely Dress suitable to his Years, who seem\u0027d to perform his Devotions with Fervor and Integrity of Heart; nevertheless, this wicked Wight, pick\u0027d up a young Girl in order to debauch her; which was in this manner. Immediately when they came out of the Chapel, he began to commend the young People he saw there, for leaving their Morning-Slumbers, to come and serve God in his Sanctuary: \"In particular, You, Sweet-heart, (addressing to one lately come out of the Country) have hardly yet any Acquaintance, to ingage you to meet upon an Intrigue or Cabal; (at least I guess so by your Mien and Garb) but come hither purely for God\u0027s Worship, which is extremely commendable, and ought to be encourag\u0027d. Come, pretty Maid, come along with me, and I will give you a Breakfast, together with good Instructions how to avoid the Vices of the Town, of which I am convinced you are thoroughly ignorant.\" Thus this old Whorson play\u0027d the Devil for God\u0027s sake, according to the Proverb, and took this young Innocent into a House of very ill Repute. \n \n It was not long e\u0027er this poor Wretch began to find herself ill and out of Order: She came to me, hearing that I had some Skill in Physick; but I perceiving her Distemper to be such as I did not well understand, nor cared to meddle withal, recommended her to a Physician of my Acquaintance, who was more used to the immodest Harangues necessary on such Occasions. I calling to mind, that this was she, who had been seduced at the early Prayers, was a little curious to know the Manner of her Undoing. \n \n She told me, That the Person who misled her, was a Goldsmith, living in good Repute in that Quarter of the Town. He gave her a great deal of good Counsel to avoid the Beaus and Gallants of the Town; which if she did, and behav\u0027d herself modestly and discreetly, he said, she should want for nothing; for he would be a Father to her: bad her meet him again on the Morrow, and he would bring a Ring, and therewith espouse her. Which accordingly he did, and put the Ring on the Wedding Finger, and took her for his Left-hand Wife. By this Fallacy, was this silly Girl ruin\u0027d. They continued this their Commerce for some time; he giving her many Treats and Presents; \u0027till, by degrees, he grew weary, diminished his Favours, met her but seldom, and at last took no Notice of her. Whether she was lewd with any other Person, and got the Venereal Distemper, and so disoblig\u0027d him, or what other Reason, I know not; but she being abandon\u0027d by her Gallant, and disabled by her Illness, was reduc\u0027d to great Distress, and from Time to Time was forced to sell what she had to relieve her Necessities. The Ring she kept \u0027till the last, that being the Pledge of his Love, and pretended Constancy; but then was forc\u0027d to seek to make Money of that vile Treasure, the Snare that had intangled both Body and Souls Now this silly Creature never knew directly where this her Gallant liv\u0027d. I suppose his Cunning conceal\u0027d that from her; whether by Sham or directly refusing to tell her, I know not: But she ignorantly stumbled on his Shop to sell this Ring; where finding an elderly Matron, she address\u0027d herself to her to buy it. The good Gentlewoman seeing her Husband\u0027s Mark on the Ring, and calling to mind, that she had miss\u0027d such a one some time ago, seiz\u0027d the Girl, in order to carry her before a Justice to make her prove where, and how, she came by that Ring. The poor Wretch, all trembling, told her, That a Gentleman had given it her; but indeed, she did not know where he lived. Whereupon the Gentlewoman reply\u0027d, That if she could not produce the Person that gave it her, she must be prosecuted as a Felon, and as such, undergo what the Course of Law should allot her; and accordingly order\u0027d her immediately into the Hands of a Constable, to have her before a Justice. At this Moment, it so happen\u0027d, that the Master of the Shop came in; at which the poor trembling, frighted Creature, cry\u0027d out, O Madam! this is the Gentleman that gave me the Ring. You impudent Slut, reply\u0027d he, I know you not; get you gone out of my Shop! and so push\u0027d her out. She being glad to get thus quit, hasted away, leaving the Man and his Wife to finish the Dispute between themselves. \n \n Behold, Madam, what an odd Piece of Iniquity was here. That a Man in Years shou\u0027d break his Morning\u0027s Rest, leave his Wife, House, and Shop at Random, and expose himself to the chill Morning Air, to act the Hypocrite and Adulterer; ruin an innocent young Creature, under the Pretence of a ridiculous Sham-Marriage, and at the same Time exhaust that Means which should support his Family and his Credit, is to me wonderful to conceive. At last the poor Creature was abandon\u0027d to all Misery, even Hunger and a nauseous Disease; between which she must have inevitably perish\u0027d, a loathsome Example of Folly and Lewdness; but that the Doctor to whom I had recommended her, got her into an Hospital, from whence, after her Cure, she went away to the Plantations, those great Receptacles of such scandalous and miserable Miscreants. \n \n Pardon, Madam, this long Digression, which is not out of an Inclination to rake in such Mud, which produces nothing but Offence to the Senses of all vertuous Persons; but it came into my Way to shew how much I was mistaken, in the Vertue and Piety of some of those early Devotees. Not that I mean by this or the like Example, to condemn all who there daily make their Addresses to Heaven: But to shew you, that in all Places, and at all Times, my Country Innocence render\u0027d me a kind of a Solitary in the midst of Throngs and great Congregations. But though I found my self thus alone in Morals, yet I no where found a personal Solitude; but all Places full; all Persons in a Hurry; suitable to what that great Wit, Sir John Denham, says; \n \n — With equal Haste they run, \n \n Some to undo, and some to be undone. \n \n At home, at our own Lodging, there was as little Quiet, between the Noise of the Street, our own House, with Lodgers, Visiters, Messages, Howd\u0027ye\u0027s, Billets, and a Thousand other Impertinencies; which, perhaps, the Beau World wou\u0027d think Diversion, but to my dull Capacity were mere Confusion. Besides which, several People came to me for Advice in divers sorts of Maladies, and having tolerable good Luck, I began to be pretty much known. The Pleasure I took in thus doing good, much over-balanced the Pains I had in the Performance; for which benign kind Disposition, I most humbly bless my great Creator (the free Disposer of all Blessings) for having compos\u0027d me of such a Temper, as to prefer a vertuous or a charitable Action, before the Pomps or Diversions of the World, though they shou\u0027d be accompanied with Riches and Honours; which, indeed, I did not injoy, nor expect; therefore happy, that my Inclinations corresponded with my Circumstances. The Truth is, I know not but that Pride and Vanity might, in some Degree, be united to this Beneficence; for I was got to such a Pitch of helping the Sick, that I wrote my Bills in Latin, with the same manner of Cyphers and Directions as Doctors do; which Bills and Recipes the Apothecaries fil\u0027d amongst those of the Doctors: And this being in particular one of my Sex, my Muse wou\u0027d needs have a Finger in the Pye; and so a Copy of Verses was writ on the Subject; which, perhaps, your Ladyship may like so as to put them in your Screen. They are as follow: \n On the Apothecaries Filing my Recipes amongst the Doctors. \n \n I hope I sha\u0027n\u0027t be blam\u0027d, if I am proud \n \n To be admitted in this learned Croud. \n \n For to be proud of Fortune so sublime, \n \n Methinks, is rather Duty than a Crime. \n \n Were not my Thoughts exalted in this State, \n \n I should not make thereof due Estimate: \n \n And, sure, one Cause of Adam\u0027s Fall, was this, \n \n He knew not the just Worth of Paradise. \n \n But with this Honour I\u0027m so satisfy\u0027d, \n \n The Ancients were not more, when Deify\u0027d. \n \n \u0027Tis this makes me a fam\u0027d Physician grow, \n \n As Saul \u0027mongst Prophets turn\u0027d a Prophet too. \n \n ???The Sturdy Gout, which all Male-Power withstands, \n \n Is overcome by my soft Female Hands. \n \n Not Deb\u0027rah, Judith, or Semiramis, \n \n Cou\u0027d boast of Conquest half so great as this; \n \n More than they slew, I save, in this Disease. \n \n ???Now Blessings on you All, you Sons of Art, \n \n Who what your selves ne\u0027er knew, to me impart, \n \n Thus Gold, which by th\u0027 Sun\u0027s Influence does grow, \n \n Does that i\u0027th\u0027 Market, Phoebus cannot do. \n \n Bless\u0027d be the Time, and bless\u0027d my Pains \u0026 Fate, \n \n Which introduc\u0027d me to a Place so great! \n \n False Strephon too, I almost now cou\u0027d bless, \n \n Whose Crimes conduc\u0027d to this my Happiness. \n \n Had he been true, I\u0027d liv\u0027d in sottish Ease, \n \n Ne\u0027er study\u0027d ought, but how to love and please; \n \n No other Flame, my Virgin Breast had fir\u0027d, \n \n But Love and Life together had expir\u0027d. \n \n But when, false Wretch! he his forc\u0027d Kindness pay\u0027d, \n \n With less Devotion than e\u0027er Sexton pray\u0027d, \n \n Fool that I was! to sigh, weep, almost dye, \n \n Little fore-thinking of this present Joy; \n \n Thus happy Brides shed Tears, they know not why. \n \n Vainly we praise this Cause, or laugh at that, \n \n Whilst the Effect, with its How, Where, \u0026 What, \n \n Lies Embrio in the Womb of Time or Fate. \n \n Of future Things we very little know, \n \n And \u0027tis Heav\u0027ns Kindness, that it should be so; \n \n Were not our Souls, with Ignorance so buoy\u0027d, \n \n They\u0027d sink with Fear, or overset with Pride. \n \n So much for Ignorance there may be said, \n \n That large Encomiums might thereof be made. \n \n But I\u0027ve digress\u0027d too far; so must return, \n \n To make the Medick-Art my whole Concern, \n \n Since by its Aid, I\u0027ve gain\u0027d this honour\u0027d Place, \n \n Amongst th\u0027 immortal ?sculapian-Race: \n \n That if my Muse, will needs officious be, \n \n She must to this become a Votary. \n \n In all our Songs, its Attributes rehearse, \n \n Write Recipes, as Ovid Law, in Verse. \n \n To Measure we\u0027ll reduce Febrific-Heat, \n \n And make the Pulses in true Numbers beat. \n \n Asthma and Phthisick chant in Lays most sweet; \n \n The Gout and Rickets too, shall run on Feet. \n \n In fine, my Muse, such Wonders we will do, \n \n That to our Art, Mankind their Ease shall owe; \n \n Then praise and please our-selves in doing so. \n \n For since the Learn\u0027d exalt and own our Fame, \n \n It is no Arrogance to do the same, \n \n But due Respects, and Complaisance to them. \n \n Thus, Madam, as People before a Looking-glass, please themselves with their own Shapes and Features, though, perhaps, such as please no-body else; just so I celebrated my own Praise, according to the Proverb, for want of good Neighbours to do it for me; or rather, for want of Desert to ingage those good Neighbours. However, I will trouble your Ladyship with relating one Adventure more, which happen\u0027d in this my Practice. \n \n There came to me a Person in Quality of a Nurse who, though in a mean servile Station, had something in her Behaviour and Discourse, that seem\u0027d above her Profession: For her Words, Air, and Mien, appeared more like one entertaining Ladies in a Drawing-Room, than a Person whose Thoughts were charg\u0027d with the Care of her sick Patients, and Hands with the Pains of administring to her own Necessities. As we were in Discourse of the Business she came about, we were interrupted by a certain Noise in the Street, a little more than usual; which call\u0027d our Curiosity to the Window; where pass\u0027d by a noble fine Coach, with many Foot-men running bare-headed on each side, with all other Equipage and Garniture suitable; which made a splendid Figure, deserving the Regards of People the least curious. The Coach being pass\u0027d, I turn\u0027d me about, and found the good Nurse sunk in a fainting Fit, which was a little surprizing; but calling my Maid, with a little Endeavour, we brought her to herself; we ask\u0027d her the Cause of this sudden Disorder? Whether she was accustom\u0027d to those Fits? or, Whether any sudden Surprize or Reflection had seiz\u0027d her? She reply\u0027d, That indeed it was a sudden Surprize: The Sight of that great Coach, had affected her Spirit, so as to cause in her that Disorder. Whereupon I told her, I should be oblig\u0027d to her, if she thought fit to inform me what Person or Occasion had caus\u0027d in her so violent an Effect. To which she reply\u0027d, That a Person of his Grandeur who was in the Coach, ought not to be nam\u0027d with one of her mean Condition: Nevertheless, said she, you appearing to be a Gentlewoman of Prudence and Vertue, I will tell you my Story, without the least Disguise. \n \n My Father, said she, was the younger Son of a Country Gentleman, and was a Tradesman of Repute in the City: He gave me a Gentlewoman-like Education, as became his Family, and the Fortune he was able to bestow upon me; for he had no Child but my self, which, perhaps, was the Cause that I was more taken Notice of than I should have been otherwise. Amongst many that cast their Eyes upon me, a certain young Clerk of the Inns of Court, of a piercing Wit, graceful Mien, and flowing Eloquence, found Opportunity to make an Acquaintance with me, and as soon to make his Addresses to me. Alas! my unguarded Heart soon submitted to the Attacks of his Wit and ingaging Behaviour; and all this without the Knowledge of my Father; which was the easier accomplish\u0027d, I having no Mother. I will not repeat to you, continu\u0027d she, the many Messages, Letters, and little Presents, which attended this secret Amour, there being therein no more than ordinary on such an Occasion. \n \n Now though we had been careful and cunning enough to keep this from the Knowledge of my Father, yet Jealousy soon open\u0027d the Eyes of a Lover; for the Foreman of my Father\u0027s Shop, designing me for himself, found out our Correspondence, and discovered the same to my Father: At which he was very much displeas\u0027d, knowing that the young Gentleman had little or no Foundation, but his own Natural Parts, and his Education, to recommend him for a Husband to a City Heiress. Hereupon my Father forbad me his Company, charging me to have no manner of Correspondence with him, upon pain of his utmost Displeasure. But, alas! my Affections were too far ingag\u0027d, to let Duty have the Regency; and not only my Affections, but my faithful Word given in Promise of Marriage to this young Gentleman; which I kept from my Father, assuring him of a ready Obedience to his Commands. \n \n Thus things pass\u0027d some time in Silence and Secrecy, \u0027till my Father had an Opportunity to marry me to a wealthy Citizen; wherewith he press\u0027d me very earnestly to comply. But his Trade was none of the Genteelest, neither his Education nor Person at all polite, nor was he very suitable in Years: These Things were disagreeable in themselves; but worst of all, my Word given to my young Lawyer, render\u0027d the Difficulty almost unsurmountable. I had not Courage to let my Father know the Truth; which if I had, perhaps, I had been never the better; for the more I seem\u0027d to dislike this other Proposal, the more my Father\u0027s Aversion grew towards my young Lawyer, as supposing him to be the Obstacle that barr\u0027d me from my Duty, as he really was, in a great degree. But Things did not hold long in this Posture; for my Father press\u0027d on the Marriage with the utmost Earnestness, using Promises and Threatnings, \u0027till at last my Weakness (for I cannot call it Obedience) made me comply. After I was married, I lived in plenty enough for some Years. In the mean Time, my Father married a young Wife, by whom he had many Children, which depriv\u0027d me of all future Hopes of receiving any Benefit by his Bounty. But to shorten my Story, by such time as I had liv\u0027d a Wife about Seven Years, my Father dy\u0027d, and my Husband broke, by which I was reduc\u0027d to a low Ebb of Fortune; and he being a Man of no Family, had no Friends to assist or raise him; and with this Fall of Fortune, his Spirit sunk withal, so that he had not Courage to strive or grapple, or turn any thing about, \u0027till he had spent the utmost Penny. Whether this Ruin proceeded from Losses by Sea and Land, to which great Dealers are obnoxious, or from the immediate Hand of Heaven, for my Breach of Vow to my young Lawyer, I know not; but our Distress grew greater and greater, \u0027till I was forc\u0027d to betake my self to the Imployment of a Nurse; and my Husband to be Labourer at St. Paul\u0027s, which is his present Occupation. In the mean time, my young Lawyer grew into Fame, by his acute Parts, which he imploy\u0027d in serving the Royal-Cause, \u0027till he is become that great Man you saw pass by: which sudden Sight gave me such Confusion, that I cou\u0027d no longer support my self, but sunk into the Chair next the Place where I stood. \n \n Thus ended she her Story; which is indeed not a little extraordinary, though scarcely sufficient to merit your Ladyship\u0027s Attention. Nevertheless, the good Woman\u0027s Humility, Patience, and Industry, are greatly to be commended, and ought to be an Example to many, even her Superiors as well as her Inferiors; she being so true a Pattern of Patience, humble Condescension, and Diligence, that I think I may apply to her a Couplet I wrote on a particular Occasion, amongst some of my Poems: \n \n Where Fortune wou\u0027d not with her Wish comply, \n \n She made her Wish bear Fortune Company. \n \n Thus, Madam, I rubb\u0027d on, in the midst of Noise and Bustle, which is every where to be found in London; but Quiet and Retreat scarce any where. At last I found out a Closet in my Landlady\u0027s Back-Garret which I crept into, as if it had been a Cave on the Top of Parnassus; the Habitation of some unfortunate Muse, that had inspir\u0027d Cowley, Butler, Otway, or Orinda, with Notions different from the rest of Mankind; and for that Fault, were there made Prisoners. Here I thought I found my own poor despicable Muse given to Orinda as her Waiting-maid; and it was, perhaps, some of the worst Part of that great Lady\u0027s Punishment, to be constrain\u0027d to a daily Correspondence with so dull a Creature. However, this Hole was to me a kind of Paradise; where I thought I met with my old Acquaintance as we hope to do in the other World. Here I tumbled over Harvey and Willis at Pleasure: My impertinent Muse here found me; and here we renew\u0027d our old Acquaintance. Sometimes I wou\u0027d repel her Insinuations; and sometimes again accept her Caresses; as appears by the following Invocation. \n To my Muse. \n \n Cease, prithee, Muse, thus to infest \n \n The barren Region of my Breast, \n \n Which never can an Harvest yield, \n \n Since Weeds of Noise o\u0027er-run the Field. \n \n If Interest wont oblige thee to it, \n \n At least let Vengeance make thee do it; \n \n \u0027Cause I thy Sweets and Charms oppose, \n \n In bidding Youth become thy Foes. \n \n But nought, I see, will drive thee hence, \n \n Threats, Business, or Impertinence. \n \n But still thou dost thy Joys obtrude \n \n Upon a Mind so wholly rude, \n \n As can\u0027t afford to entertain \n \n Thee, with the Welcome of one Strain. \n \n ???Few Friends, like thee, wou\u0027d be so kind, \n \n To come where Interest does not bind; \n \n And fewer yet return again, \n \n After such Coldness and Disdain. \n \n But thou, kind Friend, art none of those; \n \n Thy Charms thou always do\u0027st oppose \n \n Against Inquietude of Mind; \n \n If I\u0027m displeas\u0027d, still thou art kind; \n \n And with thy Spells driv\u0027st Griefs away, \n \n Which else wou\u0027d make my Heart their Prey. \n \n And fill\u0027st their empty Places too, \n \n With Thoughts of what we ought to do. \n \n Thou\u0027rt to my Mind so very good, \n \n Its Consolation, Physick, Food. \n \n Thou fortify\u0027st it in Distress; \n \n In Joy augment\u0027st its Happiness: \n \n Inspiring me with harmless Rhimes, \n \n To praise good Deeds, detest all Crimes. \n \n Then, gentle Muse, be still my Guest; \n \n Take full Possession of my Breast. \n \n Thus, Madam, in my Garret-Closet, my Muse again took Possession of me: Poetry being one of those subtle Devils, that if driven out by never so many firm Purposes, good Resolutions, Aversion to that Poverty it intails upon its Adherents; yet it will always return and find a Passage to the Heart, Brain, and whole Interior; as I experienced in this my exalted Study: Or, to (use the Phrase of the Poets) my Closet in the Star-Chamber; or the Den of Parnassus. \n \n Out of this Garret, there was a Door went out to the Leads; on which I us\u0027d frequently to walk to take the Air, or rather the Smoke; for Air, abstracted from Smoke, is not to be had within Five Miles of London. Here it was that I wish\u0027d sometimes to be of Don Quixote\u0027s Sentiments, that I might take the Tops of Chimneys, for Bodies of Trees; and the rising Smoke for Branches; the Gutters of Houses, for Tarras-Walks; and the Roofs for stupendous Rocks and Mountains. However, though I could not beguile my Fancy thus, yet here I was alone, or, as the Philosopher says, never less alone. Here I entertain\u0027d my Thoughts, and indulg\u0027d my solitary Fancy. Here I could behold the Parliament-House, Westminster-Hall, and the Abbey, and admir\u0027d the Magnificence of their Structure, and still more, the Greatness of Mind in those who had been their Founders; one Place for the establishing good Laws; another for putting them in Practice; the Third for the immediate Glory of God; a Place for the continual singing his Praise, for all the Blessings bestow\u0027d on Mankind. But with what Amazement did I reflect, how Mankind had perverted the Use of those Places design\u0027d for a general Benefit: and having been reading the Reign of King Charles the First, I was amaz\u0027d, to think how those Law-Makers cou\u0027d become such Law-Confounders, as the History relates. Was it Ambition, Pride or Avarice? For what other wicked Spirit entred amongst them, we know not; but something infernal sure it was, that push\u0027d or persuaded them to bring so barbarous an Enterprize to so sad a Conclusion. Ambition sure it cou\u0027d not be, for every one cou\u0027d not be King, nor indeed cou\u0027d any one reasonably hope it. Neither cou\u0027d it be Pride, because in this Action they work\u0027d their own Disgrace. It must certainly therefore be Covetousness; for they hop\u0027d to inrich themselves by the Ruins of the Church and State, as I have heard; though the Riches were of small Durance. These kind of Thoughts entertained me; some of which, I believe, are in Writing, amongst my other Geer. \n Upon Covetousness. \n \n Covetousness we may truly call, The Dropsie of the Mind, it being an insatiable Thirst of Gain: The more we get, the more we desire, and the more we have, the less willing are we to part with any. It was a wise Remark of him that said, A Poor Man wants Many things, but the Covetous Man wants All things; for a covetous Man will want Necessaries, rather than part with his Gold; and unless we do part with it, it is of no use to us; since we can\u0027t eat, drink, or warm ourselves by it: And, as of itself it can neither feed, warm, nor cloath us, so neither can it make us Ploughshares, Pruning-hooks, Weapons of Defence, or other Utensils worthy the Value we set upon it. Yet this shining Earth commands this Lower-Orb, and for it we often sell our Friends, King, Country, Laws, and even our eternal Happiness. Thus Avarice brings many to that Region where the Coveting of Thirty Pieces of Silver brought the most abominable of all Traitors. \n \n Then I turn\u0027d my Eyes on Westminster-Hall, that noble Structure, which contains the several Courts of Justice, where those good Laws, made in the other High Court, are put in practise. But how far this Intention is perverted, God knows, and the World daily informs us. For Truth is too often disguised, and Justice over-ballanced, by means of false Witnesses, slow Evidences to Truth, avaritious Lawyers, poor Clients, Perjury, Bribery, Forgery, Clamour, Party, Mistakes, Misapprehensions, ill-stating the Case, Demurrs, Reverses, and a thousand other Shifts, Querks and Tricks, unknown to all but Lawyers. \n \n From hence I turn\u0027d my Eyes on the Abbey, and wondred to behold it standing; when so many stately Edifices and stupendous Piles were demolished. Whether its Revenues were too small to be coveted, or too large to be hop\u0027d for, I could not tell; but I believe the Stones were neither more nor less Criminal than those of their Fellow-Dilapidations. So I concluded these Considerations, with a Couplet of Sir John Denham\u0027s. \n \n Is there no temp\u0027rate Region to be known, \n \n Betwixt their torrid and our frigid Zone? \n \n I return\u0027d into my Closet, or rather my Den of Dulness, for the Retreat of such a Student deserves not the Name of a Study. Here I cast mine Eyes on a very fine Epistle in Verse from my Friends at Cambridge; whereupon I sat me down to answer it, which was to dissuade them from Poetry, notwithstanding their great Genius towards it, express\u0027d even in that Epistle. Which Answer be pleas\u0027d to take as follows. \n To my Friends; against Poetry. \n \n Dear Friends, if you\u0027ll be rul\u0027d by me, \n \n Beware the Charms of Poetry; \n \n And meddle with no fawning Muse, \n \n They\u0027ll but your harmless Love abuse. \n \n Tho\u0027 Cowley\u0027s Mistress had a Flame, \n \n As pure and lasting as his Fame; \n \n And to Orinda they were ty\u0027d, \n \n That nought their Friendship cou\u0027d divide; \n \n Yet now they\u0027re all grown Prostitutes, \n \n And wantonly admit the Suits \n \n Of any Fop, that will pretend \n \n To be their Lover, or their Friend. \n \n Tho\u0027 they to Wit, no Homage pay, \n \n Nor can the Laws of Verse obey, \n \n But ride poor Six-foot out of Breath, \n \n And rack a Metaphor to Death; \n \n Yet still, as little as they know, \n \n Are Fav\u0027rites of the Muses now. \n \n Then who wou\u0027d honour such a She, \n \n Where Fools their happier Rivals be? \n \n We surely may conclude there\u0027s none, \n \n Unless they\u0027re drunk with Helicon; \n \n Which is a Liquor that can make \n \n A Dunce set up for Rhyming Quack; \n \n A Liquor of so strange a Temper, \n \n As all our Faculties does hamper; \n \n That whoso drinks thereof is curs\u0027d \n \n To a continu\u0027d Rhyming Thirst. \n \n Unknown to us, like Spell of Witch, \n \n It strikes the Mind into an Itch; \n \n Which being scrubb\u0027d by Praise, thereby \n \n Becomes a spreading Leprosy; \n \n As hard to cure, as Dice or Whore, \n \n And makes the Patient, too, as poor: \n \n For Poverty as sure attends \n \n On Poets, as on Rich-Mens Friends: \n \n Wherefore I\u0027d banish it my Breast. \n \n Rather than be to Fools a Jest, \n \n I\u0027d to old Mammon be a Bride, \n \n Be ugly as his Ore untry\u0027d; \n \n Do every Thing for sordid Ends, \n \n Caress my Foes, betray my Friends; \n \n Speak fair to all; do good to none; \n \n Not care who\u0027s happy, who\u0027s undone; \n \n But run where Int\u0027rest pushes one; \n \n Do any thing to quench poetick Flame, \n \n And beg my Learned Friends to do the same. \n \n Looking over what I had wrote, I remember I did not like it; for instead of praising what they had sent me, as it deserv\u0027d, giving them Thanks, begging them to continue the same Favour to me and the World, I, in an uncouth, disobliging Manner, oppos\u0027d their Ingenuity; by which I very little deserved any more such agreeable Entertainments. Moreover, casting an Eye on the other Poem, which I had wrote but a Day or two before, in which I had kindly treated and cajol\u0027d my Muse; and then again on my Friends witty Epistle; so that between these Three, my Thoughts danc\u0027d the Hay, like the Sun and Moon in the Rehearsal, and thereby made an Eclipse in my Resolution. But as I have heard, that in some Countries they go with Pans and Kettles, and therewith make a Noise; whether to wake the Sun out of his imagin\u0027d Sleep, or raise him from the Dead, I know not: But, in like manner, a hasty Knocking at the Door of the Leads; disappointed this my Ecliptick Dance. I speedily open\u0027d the Door, and there found a Gentlewoman of a graceful Mien and genteel Dress: She hastily rush\u0027d in, and begg\u0027d me to fasten the Door, and then to introduce her to the Gentlewoman of the House: To which I consented, and so descended with her to my Landlady\u0027s Apartment, where we found her, together with my Mother. After I had inform\u0027d them of the Adventure of her coming over the Leads, in at the Garret-Door, they courteously receiv\u0027d her, and desir\u0027d to know wherein they cou\u0027d be further serviceable. \n \n She told them, That although her Crimes render\u0027d her too confus\u0027d to relate her Story; yet, her distressed Condition obliged her to an undisguised Recital. \n The Story of Belinda. \n \n I am, said she, Daughter to a worthy Country Gentleman, of an ancient Family and large Possessions; who lived suitable to the Rank and Station in which Heaven had plac\u0027d him. He and my Mother were esteemed by Persons of all Ranks, as indeed they deserv\u0027d; for they were beneficent to every body; Neighbours, Relations, Servants, Poor and Rich, all had a Share in their Generosity, Kindness, or Charity. Their Tenants gather\u0027d Estates under them; Their Servants gain\u0027d wherewith to become Masters in their Old Age; Their Table and Cellar were always free and open to the Freeholders, and Tradesmen, who came to pay their Respects to them; Their Park and Gardens were at the Service of any of the neighbouring Gentry, that were not Masters of such Conveniencies: Their Persons were amiable, and their Discourse agreeable and entertaining. Thus they pass\u0027d their Days in Plenty and Honour, \u0027till their unhappy Off-spring gave a new Byass to their Bowl of Life, which had hitherto rolled on with such Evenness, as testified the steady Hand of those that gave the Cast . My Brother being grown to Years of Maturity, listed himself in all the Lewdness of the Age; by which he contracted so many and such gross Infirmities, that a thorough Recovery of his Health is despaired of. \n \n Now my Parents, who had been always affectionate towards me, became extreamly fond, humouring me even to a Fault, especially since I made such ill Use of their Tenderness: For by means of this extra-ordinary Indulgence, I grew troublesome to Servants, impertinent to my Betters, rude and disobliging to my Equals, harsh and insulting to my Inferiors; in short, I behav\u0027d my self, as if all the World were created for me only, and my Service. In the mean Time, Fondness so blinded my Parents, that they saw no Fault in me, nor I in my self, which was my great Misfortune. \n \n Now, whether this humoursome, impertinent way made me disagreeable to Young Gentlemen, I know not; but though my Fortune was considerable, and my Person such as you see, not contemptible, yet nobody made any Overtures of Marriage to me, or to my Parents on my behalf; at least, that I know of. \n \n Amongst, many whom my Father\u0027s Quality and Munificence brought to our House, there was a certain fine Gentleman cast his Eyes on me, with a Tenderness unbefitting my Youth, and his Circumstances, he being a married Man; but notwithstanding that, I suffered his Insinuations to penetrate my Soul. His Looks and Gestures demonstrated a violent Passion; but his Words were always dress\u0027d up in Vertue and Honour; and the frequent Theme of his Discourse was on Platonick Love, and the happy State any Two might injoy, that lived together in such a chaste Affection. In these kind of Discourses we pass\u0027d many Hours; sometimes in Walks, sometimes in Arbours, and oftentimes in my Chamber, \u0027till very late Hours. At last, the Mask of Platonick Love was pull\u0027d off, and a personal Injoyment concluded the Farce, compos\u0027d of many deceitful Scenes, and wicked Contrivances. In a little Time I began to perceive my self pregnant, to that degree, that I daily fear\u0027d others should take notice of it. There was no way left to escape the Fury of my Parents and his Wife, but by Flight, which we put in Execution; pretending to go beyond-Sea, the better to avoid Search. But instead thereof, he brought me to a House in your Neighbourhood; and there left me. What is become of him, I know not, nor dare inquire. The Officers of the Parish being inform\u0027d of my being here, in this Condition, came to inquire into the Matter; but my Landlady being aware thereof, convey\u0027d me through her Garret over the Leads of Westminster Hall, and so into your Garret. \n \n And now, Gentlewomen, behold what a miserable Creature is before you. I cannot bear being carried before a Justice on this Account; I shall sooner lay violent Hands on my self; which I pray God forbid. Therefore, dear Ladies, advise me what to do, or how to proceed. \n \n After a little Consideration, my Landlady, with much Goodness, sent for the Officers of the Parish, to ingage on her behalf; that they might leave her in Repose, \u0027till Time should find out the Gentleman; or get some Accommodation with her Parents; after which she sent her Maid with her to her Lodging; recommending her to the Care of her Landlady, with Assurance of Payment. \n \n She being gone, we began to descant on the poor miserable Creature\u0027s Distress; withal much applauding the Charity of our good Landlady, to a Person so wholly a Stranger. No, indeed, reply\u0027d the good Gentlewoman, she is not quite a Stranger to me, for I was heretofore very well acquainted with her Parents, who were really worthy good People; but since the Birth of this Girl, her Father has chang\u0027d his generous beneficent Temper; and as she grew up in Beauty, he grew the more Niggardly; of which I could give you a particular Instance, but shall reserve it to another Opportunity; and always wish, that Parents would never set their Hearts so much on great Provisions for their Children, as to refuse Charity to any miserable Object that addresses them, as did this Gentleman; but rely on God\u0027s Providence for their Posterity, as well as their own Riches, Frugality or Industry. \n \n This Adventure, Madam, as it prov\u0027d a Consolation to this distressed Creature; so it prov\u0027d a Misfortune to me; for hereupon my Mother prohibited me my Garret-Closet, and my Walk on the Leads; lest I should encounter more Adventures, not only like this, but perhaps more pernicious: So that being depriv\u0027d of my solitary Retreat, your Ladyship cannot expect much of Verse or Poetick Fancies whereof to make Patches at present. \n \n Methinks, reply\u0027d the Lady, I should expect some doleful Ditty, upon being depriv\u0027d of this your beloved Solitude. On this Occasion I fancy you like Ovid, when banish\u0027d from all his Pleasures and Injoyments in the glorious City of Rome; you being depriv\u0027d of what you preferr\u0027d before all them; which shews, there is no Possibility of making People happy against their Will. Some are happy in a Cottage; others can scarce endure Life but in a Palace. Some take great Delight in Fields, Woods, and Rural Walks: others again, in lofty Buildings, glorious Apartments, sumptuous Entertainments, Balls, Dancings, Shows, and Masquerades. \n \n \u0027Tis true, Madam, reply\u0027d Galesia; and this makes me reflect, how useless, or rather pernicious, Books and Learning are to our Sex. They are like Oatmeal or Charcoal to the deprav\u0027d Appetites of Girls; for by their Means we relish not the Diversions or Imbellishments of our Sex and Station; which render us agreeable to the World, and the World to us; but live in a Stoical Dulness or humersome Stupidity. However, I comply\u0027d with my Mother, and made Inclination submit to Duty; and so endeavour\u0027d to make a Vertue of this Necessity, and live like others of my Rank, according to Time, Place and Conveniency. \n \n My dear Mother now growing aged, began to be very desirous to see me established in a married State; daily inculcating to me, That we, in a manner, frustrate the End of our Creation, to live in that uncouth kind of Solitude, in which she thought I too much delighted, and which she believed would grow upon me, when God should take her away: At what Time, I should then have no body to consolate, protect or assist me; urging, That I ought not to pass my Time in idle Dreams on Parnassus, and foolish Romantick Flights, with Icarus; whose waxen Wings fail\u0027d him so as to let him fall into the Sea; which indeed purchas\u0027d him a Name, but became the perpetual Record of his Folly: And such a Name, such a Record, I should be glad, said she, you would avoid, by becoming a good Mistress of a Family; and imploy your Parts in being an obedient Wife, a discreet Governess of your Children and Servants; a friendly Assistant to your Neighbours, Friends, and Acquaintance: This being the Business for which you came into the World, and for the Neglect of this, you must give an Account when you go out of it. These were Truths which Reason would not permit me to oppose; but my Reflections on Bosvil\u0027s Baseness, gave me a secret Disgust against Matrimony. However, her often repeated Lectures, call\u0027d for Compliance, especially Fortune seeming at that Time to concur with my Mother\u0027s Counsel, in the following manner. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1233/37080.html","bookId":60,"book":{"id":60,"title":"A Patch-Work Screen for the Ladies","description":"简介： When we parted from Galesia last, it was in St. Germain\u0027s Garden; and now we meet with her in England, travelling in a Stage-Coach from London Northward; where she had the Luck to meet with good Company, who entertained each other agreeably with Thin...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1233","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
