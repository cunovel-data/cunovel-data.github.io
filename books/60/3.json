{"id":1857,"no":3,"title":"A Patch-Work SCREEN FOR THE LADIES. LEAF I.","content":"The Continuation of the History of Galesia. \n \n The good Lady and Galesia being thus sate down to their Work, and the Trunks open\u0027d, the first Thing they laid their Hands on, was a Piece of a Farce, which the Lady would have put by, for another Opportunity; and desired Galesia to begin where Lucasia and she broke off in St. Germains-Garden: To which Galesia readily comply\u0027d without Hesitation. \n \n HAVING disingag\u0027d my Thoughts from Bosvil, said she, I had nothing to disturb my Tranquility, or hinder me from being Happy, but the Absence of my dear Brother, who was gone a second Time beyond Sea, to study at the University of Leyden, that being the Third Place where he endeavour\u0027d to inrich his Mind; having before gathered a Treasure of Learning from those Two inexhaustible Fountains, Oxford and Paris: thereby to inable him to perform, what he shortly intended to practise, the Cure of Human Maladies; in which he began already to be known and esteemed. \n \n It would be too tedious to give your Ladyship a Character of this excellent Man, whose Learning grac\u0027d his natural Parts, and his vertuous Life was an Honour to his Learning. His Philosophy and Medicinal Science did not supplant Civility, but cultivated and inrich\u0027d his natural pleasant Humour. He was in every thing a Gentleman and a Christian, so that Envy herself could not find a feeble Side whereon to plant her Batteries, to attack or deface that Esteem his Merits had rais\u0027d in the Hearts of all that knew him; which serv\u0027d to make me more sensible of his Absence. \n \n However, I comforted my self with the Hopes of his Return; and in the mean time, corresponded as often as I cou\u0027d in Writing, passing the rest of my Time in my shady Walks, Fields, and Rural Affairs. The Pleasure of which was greatly improv\u0027d by reading Mrs. Phillips. I began to emulate her Wit, and aspir\u0027d to imitate her Writings; in doing of which, I think, I deserv\u0027d Arachne\u0027s Fate, or at least to be transform\u0027d into one of the lowest of Mack-Fleckno\u0027s Followers: Her noble Genius being inimitable; especially in Praise of a Country-Life, and Contempt of human Greatness; all which I swallow\u0027d as Draughts of rich Cordial, to enliven the Understanding. Her Poetry I found so interwoven with Vertue and Honour, that each Line was like a Ladder to climb, not only to Parnassus, but to Heaven: which I (poor Puzzle as I was!) had the Boldness to try to imitate, \u0027till I was dropp\u0027d into a Labyrinth of Poetry, which has ever since interlac\u0027d all the Actions of my Life. Amongst other Fancies, I took into my Head, to draw a Landskip in Verse, beginning with a Grove. \n The GROVE. \n \n Well might the Ancients deem a Grove to be \n \n The sacred Mansion of some Deity; \n \n Its pleasing Shades, and gloomy Terrors, move \n \n Our Souls at once to pious Fears and Love: \n \n Betwixt these Passions, rightly understood, \n \n Lies the streight Road to everlasting Good. \n \n Fear frights from Hell, and Love exalts to Heav\u0027n; \n \n Happy the Soul to whom these Two are giv\u0027n! \n \n Beside the Pleasure of the Present Time, \n \n To walk and muse, describe its Sweets in Rhime; \n \n Where nought but Peace and Innocence obtrude, \n \n The worst that can be said of it, \u0027tis rude. \n \n Yet Nature\u0027s Culture is so well express\u0027d, \n \n That Art herself would wish to be so dress\u0027d. \n \n ???Lo! here the Sun conspires with ev\u0027ry Tree, \n \n To deck the Earth in Landskip-Tapistry: \n \n Then thro\u0027 some Space his brightest Beams appear, \n \n Erecting a bright golden Pillar there. \n \n Here a close Canopy of Boughs is made; \n \n There a soft grassy Cloth of State is spread; \n \n With Gems and gayest Flow\u0027rs imbroider\u0027d o\u0027er, \n \n Fresh as those Beauties honest Swains adore. \n \n Here Nature\u0027s Hand, for Health and Pleasure, sets \n \n Cephalick Cowslips, Cordial Violets. \n \n The cooling Diuretick Woodbine grows, \n \n Supported by th\u0027 Scorbutick Canker-Rose. \n \n Splenetick Columbines their Heads hang down, \n \n As if displeas\u0027d their Vertue should be known. \n \n Pinks, Lillies, Daisies, Bettony, Eye bright, \n \n To purge the Head, strengthen or clear the Sight. \n \n Some mollify, some draw, some Ulcers clear, \n \n Some purify, and some perfume the Air. \n \n Of which some gentle Nymph the fairest takes, \n \n And for her Coridon a Garland makes: \n \n Whilst on her Lap the happy Youth\u0027s Head lies, \n \n Gazing upon the Aspects of her Eyes; \n \n The most unerring, best Astronomy, \n \n Whereby to calculate his Destiny. \n \n Whilst o\u0027er their Heads a Pair of Turtles coo, \n \n Which with less Constancy and Passion wooe. \n \n The Birds around, thro\u0027 their extended Throats, \n \n In careless Consort, chant their pleasing Notes; \n \n Than which no sweeter Musick charms the Ear, \n \n Except when Lovers Sighs each other hear; \n \n Which are more soft than austral Breeses bring, \n \n Altho\u0027 \u0027tis said, they\u0027re Harbingers o\u0027th\u0027 Spring. \n \n ???Methinks, I pity much the busy Town, \n \n To whom these Rural Pleasures are not known. \n \n But more I pity those whom Fate inthralls, \n \n Who can\u0027t retire when Inclination calls, \n \n By Business, Families, and Fortune ty\u0027d; \n \n Beset, besieg\u0027d, attack\u0027d on ev\u0027ry Side, \n \n By Friends \u0026 Foes; Wit, Beauty, Mirth \u0026 Wine, \n \n Piques, Parties, Policies, and Flatterers join \n \n To storm one\u0027s Quiet, Vertue undermine. \n \n ???\u0027Tis hard we must, the World\u0027s so vicious grown, \n \n Be complaisant in Crimes, or live alone! \n \n For those who now with Vertue are indu\u0027d, \n \n Do live alone, tho\u0027 in a Multitude. \n \n Then fly, all ye whom Fortune don\u0027t oblige \n \n To suffer the Distresses of a Siege; \n \n Fly to some calm Retreat, and there retrieve \n \n Your squander\u0027d Time; \u0027Tis ne\u0027er too late to live. \n \n Free from all Envy, and the tiresome Noise \n \n Of prating Fools, and Wits that ne\u0027er were wise: \n \n Free from Ambition, and from base Design, \n \n Which equally our Vertue undermine, \n \n In Plenty here, without Excess, we dine. \n \n If we in wholsome Exercise delight, \n \n Our Sleep becomes more sound \u0026 sweet at Night; \n \n Or if one\u0027s Mind to Contemplation leads, \n \n Who has the Book of God and Nature, needs \n \n No other Object to imploy his Thought, \n \n Since in each Leaf such Mysteries are wrought, \n \n That whoso studies most, shall never know \n \n Why the strait Elm\u0027s so tall, the Moss so low. \n \n ???I farther cou\u0027d inlarge upon this Theme, \n \n But that I\u0027m, unawares, come to the Stream, \n \n Which at the Bottom of this Grove doth glide: \n \n And now I\u0027ll rest me by its flow\u0027ry Side. \n \n Thus, Madam, I have given you the first Taste of my Country-Poetry, which to your Ladyship (who is furnish\u0027d with all the fine Pieces that come out) must needs be as insipid as Water-gruel to breakfast, of those that are us\u0027d to Chocolate and rich Jellies. \n \n It will do very well, reply\u0027d the Lady, a Landskip in a Screen, is very agreeable; therefore let me have the rest. \n \n The next Madam (reply\u0027d Galesia) is the Rivulet at the Bottom of the Grove, which I try\u0027d to mould into Pindarick: I suppose, out of Curiosity; for I neither love to read nor hear that kind of Verse. Methinks, it is to the Ear like Virginal Jacks to the Eye; being all of irregular Jumps, and Starts, sudden Disappointments, and long-expected Periods, which deprives the Mind of that Musick, wherewith the good Sense would gratify it, if in other Measures. But since your Ladyship commands, be pleas\u0027d to take it as it is; next to Blank Verse disagreeable: (at least, to my Ear) one sort spoils good Verse, the other good Prose; whereas the regular Chime of other Verse, helps to make amends for indifferent Sense: Wherefore, fit to be courted by me; whose Fingers ought to have been imploy\u0027d rather at the Needle and the Distaff, than to the Pen and Standish, and leave these Enterprizes to the Learned, who know how to compose all Measures, thereby to please all Palates. However, at present, I shall sacrifice this Aversion to the Obedience due to your Ladyship\u0027s Commands. \n The Rivulet. \n I. \n \n Ah! lovely Stream, how fitly may\u0027st thou be, \n \n ??????By thy Immutability, \n \n Thy gentle Motion and Perennity, \n \n ???To us the Emblem of Eternity? \n \n ??????And, to us, thou dost no less \n \n A kind of Omnipresence, too, express, \n \n ??????For always at the Ocean, thou \n \n Art ever here, and at thy Fountain too; \n \n Always thou go\u0027st thy proper Course, \n \n Most willingly, and yet by Force, \n \n Each Wave forcing its precursor on; \n \n Yet each one freely runs, with equal haste, \n \n As if each fear\u0027d to be the last; \n \n With mutual Strife, void of Con-ten-ti-on, \n \n In Troops they march, \u0027till thousand, thousand\u0027s past, \n \n ???Yet, gentle Stream, art still the same, \n \n ???Always going, never gone: \n \n ???Yet do\u0027st all Constancy disclaim, \n \n Wildly dancing to thine own murmuring tuneful Song, \n \n ???Old as Time, as Love and Beauty young. \n II. \n \n But chiefly thou to Unity lay\u0027st claim, \n \n ??????For though in Thee \n \n Innumerable Drops there be, \n \n ??????Yet still thou art but One, \n \n Th\u0027 Original of which, from Heav\u0027n came; \n \n ??????Whose purest Transcript we \n \n I\u0027th\u0027 Church may wish, but never hope to see, \n \n ???Whilst each Pretender thinks himself alone \n \n ??????To be the True Church Militant: \n \n ??????Nay, well it is, if such will grant, \n \n That there is one elsewhere Triumphant. \n III. \n \n ???Ah, gentle Stream! ah, happy we! \n \n ??????Cou\u0027d we but learn of thee, \n \n As thou dost Nature, we our God obey; \n \n ??????Gently rolling on our Way: \n \n ??????And as we pass, like thee do good, \n \n ??????Benign to all our Neighbourhood; \n \n To God and Man, our Love and Duty pay: \n \n Then at our Ocean we Repose shall find, \n \n The Ocean Grave, which swallows all Mankind! \n \n Thus, Madam, I trifled my Time, \u0027till the Return of my Brother from Leyden, which was to me like the Return of Spring to Northern Climes. His drooping Presence rais\u0027d my Spirits, and dispers\u0027d those Clouds of Sorrow gather\u0027d in my Heart by Bosvil\u0027s Falshood. I began to delight myself in Dressing, Visiting, and other Entertainments, befitting a young Gentlewoman; nevertheless, did not omit my Study, in which my Brother continued to oblige my Fancy, and assisted me in Anatomy and Simpling, in which we took many a pleasing Walk, and gather\u0027d many Patterns of different Plants, in order to make a large natural Herbal. I made such Progress in Anatomy, as to understand Harvey\u0027s Circulation of the Blood, and Lower\u0027s Motion of the Heart. By these and the like Imployments, I began to forget and scorn Bosvil. If I thought on him at all, it was with Contempt; and I wonder\u0027d how it came to pass that I ever lov\u0027d him, and thought myself secure the rest of my Days from that Weakness. \n \n As I thus betook myself to an Amusement different from my Sex and Years, my other young Companions, began to look grave upon me; or I, perhaps, look\u0027d so upon them. Our little Follies of telling our Dreams; laying Things under each other\u0027s Heads to dream of our Amours; counting Specks on our Nails, who should have the most Presents from Friends or Lovers; tying Knots in the Grass; pinning Flowers on our Breasts, to know the Constancy of our Pretenders; drawing Husbands in the Ashes; St. Agnes\u0027s Fast; and all such childish Auguries, were now no more any Diversion to me; so that I became an useless Member in our Rural Assemblies. My Time and Thoughts were taken up in Harvey, Willis, and such-like Authors, which my Brother help\u0027d me to understand and relish, which otherwise might have seemed harsh or insipid: And these serv\u0027d to make me unfit Company for every body; for the Unlearned fear\u0027d, and the Learned scorn\u0027d my Conversation; at least, I fancy\u0027d so: A Learned Woman, being at best but like a Forc\u0027d-Plant, that never has its due or proper Relish, but is wither\u0027d by the first Blast that Envy or Tribulation blows over her Endeavours. Whereas every Thing, in its proper Place and Season, is graceful, beneficial, and pleasant. However, my dear Brother humouring my Fancy, I pass\u0027d my Time in great Satisfaction. His Company was my Recreation, and his wise Documents my Instruction; even his Reproofs were but as a poignant Sauce, to render his good Morals the more savoury, and easier digested. Thus we walk\u0027d and talk\u0027d; we laugh\u0027d and delighted our-selves; we dress\u0027d and visited; we received our Friends kindly, and by them were generously treated in their turn: all which was to the Satisfaction of our endearing tender Parents. But, alas! short was the Continuance of this Happiness; for my dear Brother died. And now, Madam, forgive these flowing Tears, which interrupt my Discourse. \n \n Galesia having discharg\u0027d a Torrent of Tears, the usual Effect of any Discourse for so great a Loss, she endeavoured to compose her self, dry\u0027d her Eyes, and return\u0027d to her Story. \n \n This, Madam, was such a Grief as I had never felt; for though I had suffer\u0027d much in the Transactions of Bosvil; yet those Sorrows were allay\u0027d, in some degree, by the Mixture of other Passions, as Hope, Fear, Anger, Scorn, Revenge, \u0026 c. But this was Grief in Abstract, Sorrow in pure Element. I griev\u0027d without ceasing; my Sighs alternatively blew up my Tears, and my Tears allay\u0027d my Sighs, \u0027till fresh Reflections rais\u0027d new Gusts of Sorrow. My Solitude was fill\u0027d with perpetual Thoughts of Him; and Company was entertain\u0027d with nothing but Discourses of this my irreparable Loss. My sleeping, as well as waking Hours, were fill\u0027d with Ideas of him! Sometimes I dream\u0027d I saw his Ghost, come to visit me from the other World; sometimes I thought I assisted him in his Sickness; sometimes attending at his Funeral; then awake in a Flood of Tears; when, waking, I cou\u0027d form no Thought or Idea, but what Grief suggested. In my Walks and Studies, it was still the same, the Remembrance of some wise Documents, or witty Entertainment, roused up my Grief, by reflecting on my great Loss. No Book or Paper cou\u0027d I turn over, but I found Memorandums of his Wisdom and Learning, which served to continue and augment my Grief; and so far transported me sometimes, that I even wish\u0027d for that which is the Horror of Nature, that I might see his Ghost. I experienced what the Philosophers assert, That much reflecting on Death, is the way to make it less terrible; and \u0027tis certain, I reflected so much on his, that I wish\u0027d for nothing more; wish\u0027d to be with him; wish\u0027d to be in that happy State, in which I assur\u0027d my self his Vertues had plac\u0027d him. But in vain I wish\u0027d for Death; I was ordain\u0027d to struggle with the Difficulties of Life; which were to be many, as I have since experienced; Heaven having taken away from me, Him, who seem\u0027d by Nature ordain\u0027d to conduct me through the Labyrinth of this World, when the Course of Nature should take my dear indulgent Parents from me, to their Repose in Elysium. And now, instead of being a Comfort to them in this their great Affliction, my Griefs added Weight to theirs, such as they could hardly sustain. \n \n I read those Books he had most studied, where I often found his Hand-writing, by way of Remarks, which always caus\u0027d a new Flux of Tears. I often call\u0027d upon Death; but Death was deaf, or his Malice otherwise imploy\u0027d on more worthy Prey; leaving me a useless Wretch; useless to the World; useless to my Friends, and a Burden to myself: Whilst he that was necessary to his Friends, an Honour to his Profession, and beneficial to Mankind, (but chiefly to me) the Tyrant Death had seiz\u0027d and convey\u0027d away for ever! — O that Word Ever! that Thought Ever! The Reflection of Ever and Never, devour\u0027d all that cou\u0027d be agreeable or pleasing to me: Ever to want his wise Instructions! Never to injoy his flowing Wit! Ever to regret this my irreparable Loss! Never to have his dear Company in my shady Walks! This Ever and Never, star\u0027d in my Thoughts like Things with Saucer-Eyes in the Dark, serving to fright me from all Hopes of Happiness in this World. \n \n In these and the like anxious and melancholy Amusements, I pass\u0027d my woeful Days, \u0027till Length of Time, which changes and devours all Things, began a little to abate my Grief, and the Muses began to steal again into my Breast; and having, as I said before, affected to study those Books, on which I had seen my Brother most intent, I at last resolv\u0027d to begin with a Body of Anatomy, and between whiles, to reduce it into Verse: Perhaps, reflecting on what is said of Ovid, that he writ Law in Verse: And Physick being as little reducible to that Softness as Law, I know not what Emulation or Fancy excited me; but thus I began: \n An Invocation of her Muse. \n \n Come, gentle Muse! assist me now, \n \n A double Wreath plait for my Brow, \n \n Of Poetry and Physick too. Teach me in Numbers to rehearse \n \n Hard Terms of Art, in smooth, soft Verse, \n \n And how we grow, and how decrease. Teach me to sing Apollo\u0027s Sons, \n \n The Ancient and the Modern-ones, \n \n And sing their Praise in gentle Tones. But chiefly sing those Sons of Art, \n \n Which teach the Motion of the Heart, \n \n Nerves, Spirits, Brains, and every Part. \n ANATOMY. \n \n Now Bartholine, the first of all this Row, \n \n Does to me Nature\u0027s Architecture show; \n \n How the Foundation, first, of Earth is laid; \n \n Then, how the Pillars of Strong-Bones are made. \n \n The Walls consist of Carneous-Parts within, \n \n The Out-side pinguid, overlay\u0027d with Skin; \n \n The Fret-work, Muscles, Arteries and Veins, \n \n With their Implexures; and how from the Brains \n \n The Nerves descend; and how \u0027tis they dispense \n \n To every Member Motive-Power, and Sense. \n \n He shews the Windows in this Structure fix\u0027d, \n \n How trebly glaz\u0027d, and Curtains drawn betwixt \n \n Them \u0026 Earth\u0027s Objects: All which prove in vain \n \n To keep out Lust, or Innocence retain. \n \n For \u0027twas the Eye, that first discern\u0027d the Food, \n \n As pleasing to itself, for eating good, \n \n Then was persuaded, that it wou\u0027d refine \n \n The half-wise Soul, and make it all Divine. \n \n But O how dearly Wisdom\u0027s bought with Sin, \n \n Which shuts out Grace; lets Death \u0026 Darkness in. \n \n And \u0027cause our Sex precipitated first, \n \n To Pains, and Ignorance we since are curs\u0027d. \n \n Desire of Knowledge, cost us very dear; \n \n For Ignorance, e\u0027er since, became our Share. \n \n ???But as I was inlarging on this Theme, \n \n Willis and Harvey bid me follow them. \n \n ???They brought me to the a first \u0026 largest Court \n \n Of all this Building, where, as to a Port, \n \n All Necessaries are brought from afar, \n \n For Susentation, both in Peace and War. \n \n For War b this Common-wealth, doth oft insest, \n \n Which pillages one Part, and storms the rest. \n \n ???We view\u0027d the Kitchen call\u0027d Ventriculus; \n \n Then pass\u0027d we through the Space call\u0027d Pylorus; \n \n And to the Dining-Room we came at last, \n \n Where the Lacteals take their sweet Repast. \n \n From thence we thro\u0027 a Drawing-room did pass, \n \n And came where Jecur very busie was: \n \n c Sanguificating the whole Mass of Chyle, \n \n And severing the Crural Parts from Bile: \n \n And when she\u0027s made it tolerably good, \n \n She pours it forth to mix with other Blood. \n \n This \u0026 much more we saw; from thence we went \n \n Into the d next Court by a small Ascent. \n \n Bless me! said I; what Rarities are here! \n \n A e Fountain like a Furnace did appear, \n \n Still boiling o\u0027er, and running out so fast, \n \n That one wou\u0027d think its Eflux, cou\u0027d not last: \n \n Yet it sustain\u0027d no Loss, as I cou\u0027d see, \n \n Which made me think it a strange Prodigy. \n \n Come on, says Harvey, don\u0027t stand gazing here, \n \n But follow me, and I thy Doubts will clear. \n \n ???Then we began our Journey with the Blood, \n \n Trac\u0027d the Meanders of its Purple Flood. \n \n Thus we thro\u0027 many Labyrinths did pass, \n \n In such, I am sure, old D?dalus ne\u0027er was. \n \n Sometimes ith\u0027 Out-works, sometimes the First-Court, \n \n Sometimes i\u0027th\u0027 Third these winding Streams would sport. \n \n Such Rarities we found in this Third Place, \n \n As put ev\u0027n Comprehension to disgrace. \n \n Here\u0027s Cavities, said one; And here, says He, \n \n Is th\u0027 Seat of Fancy, Judgment, Memory. \n \n Here, says another, is the fertile Womb, \n \n From whence the Spirits-Animal do come: \n \n Which are mysteriously ingender\u0027d here, \n \n Of Spirits, from arterial Blood and Air. \n \n Here, says a third, Life made her first approach, \n \n Moving the Wheels of her triumphant Coach. \n \n But Harvey that Hypothesis deny\u0027d, \n \n Say\u0027ng \u0027twas the Deaf-Ear on the Dexter-side. \n \n Then there arose a trivial small Dispute, \n \n Which he by Fact and Reason did confute. \n \n This being ended, we began again \n \n Our former Progress, and forsook the Brain; \n \n And after some small Traverses about, \n \n Came to the Place where we before set out: \n \n Then I perceiv\u0027d, how Harvey all made good, \n \n By th\u0027 Circles of the Circulating Blood, \n \n As Fountains have their Water from the Sea, \n \n To which again they do themselves convey. \n \n And here we found great Lower, with much Art, \n \n Surveying the whole Structure of the Heart. \n \n Welcome said he, dear Cousin! Are you here? \n \n Sister to Him, whose Worth we all revere: \n \n But ah, alas! So short was his Life\u0027s Date, \n \n As makes us since, almost, our Practice hate; \n \n Since we cou\u0027d find out nought in all our Art, \n \n That cou\u0027d prolong the Motion of his Heart. \n \n This latter Line, Madam, was, and is, and ever will be, my great Affliction. So dear a Friend, shining with such Brightness of Parts, cut off in his Bloom! Ah Me! I cannot think or speak of him without weeping; which if I did not in abundance, I shou\u0027d not be just to his Memory; I shou\u0027d be unworthy of that Fraternal Love he express\u0027d to me on all Occasions; so that it is fit I should weep on all Occasions; especially when I reflect how much I want him in every Circumstance of Life. The only Comfort I have, is, when I think on the Happiness he enjoys by Divine Vision; All Learning and Science, All Arts, and Depths of Philosophy, without Search or Study; whilst we in this World, with much Labour, are gropeing, as it were, in the Dark, and make Discoveries of our own Ignorance. Which Thoughts wou\u0027d sometimes fold themselves in these or the like Words. \n I. \n \n Thou know\u0027st, my Dear, now, more than Art can! \n \n Thou know\u0027st the Essence of the Soul of Man! \n \n And of its Maker too, whose powerful Breath \n \n Gave Immortality to sordid Earth! \n \n ???What Joys, my Dear, do Thee surround, \n \n ???As no where else are to be found? \n \n ???Love, Musick, Physick, Poetry, \n \n ???Mechanicks, grave Philosophy; \n \n And in each Art, each Artist does abound; \n \n Whilst All\u0027s converted to Divinity. \n \n ???No drooping Autumn there, \n \n ???Nor chilling Winter, does appear; \n \n ???Nor scorching Heat, nor budding Spring, \n \n ???Nor Sun does Seasons there divide; \n \n Yet all Things do transcend their native Pride; \n \n ???Which fills, but does not nauseate; \n \n ???No Change nor Want of any Thing, \n \n Which Time to Periods, or Perfections, bring. \n \n ???But yet Diversity of State, \n \n And Soul\u0027s Felicity There has no Date. \n II. \n \n Shou\u0027dst Thou, my Dear, look down on us below, \n \n ???To see how busie we \n \n ???Are in Anatomy, \n \n Thou woud\u0027st despise our Ignorance, \n \n Who most Things miss, and others hit by chance, \n \n For we, at best, do but in Twilight go: \n \n Whilst Thou see\u0027st all by most transcendant Light; \n \n Compar\u0027d to which, the Sun\u0027s bright Rays are Night. \n \n ???Yet so Celestial are thine Eyes, \n \n That Light can neither dazle nor surprize; \n \n ???For all Things There \n \n ???Most perfect are, \n \n And freely their bless\u0027d Quality dispense, \n \n Without the Mixture of Terrestrial Dross, \n \n ???Or without Hazard, Harm or Loss. \n \n ???O Joys eternal, satiating Sense! \n \n And yet the Sense, the smallest Part ingross! \n \n Thus, Madam, my worthless Muse help\u0027d me to discharge my Griefs. The writing them in this my lonely State, was like discoursing, or disburthening one\u0027s Heart to a Friend. Whether your Ladyship will like to have them plac\u0027d in your Screen, you yourself must determine. \n \n By all means, reply\u0027d the Lady, these melancholy dark Patches, set off the light Colours; making the Mixture the more agreeable. I like them all so well, I will not have One lay\u0027d aside. Therefore, pray, go on with your Story. \n \n Madam, said Galesia, It was at this Time, that I had a Kinsman a Student at the University; who at certain Times, frequented our House; and now and then brought some of his young Companions with him; whose youthful and witty Conversation, greatly help\u0027d to divert my Chagrin. Amongst these vertuous young Gentlemen, there was one, whose Merit ingaged my particular Esteem, and the Compassion he had for my Griefs, planted a Friendship, which I have ever since cultivated with my best Endeavours. When he was thus become my Friend, I unbosom\u0027d my self to him, acquainted him with the Story of Bosvil, not concealing the least Weakness in all that Transaction, which was an Indiscretion I can hardly forgive my self; and I doubt not, but I shall stand condemn\u0027d in your Ladyship\u0027s Judgment: For a young Gentleman is certainly a very unfit Confidant of a young Gentlewoman\u0027s Amours: The best she can expect from such a Discovery, is his Pity, which is one Step towards Contempt; and that is but a poor sort of Consolation, or Return of that Confidence she reposes. However, his generous Soul, gave it another Turn; and instead of despising my Foible, valued my Frankness, and abhorr\u0027d Bosvil\u0027s Unworthiness, continuing to divert me with his Wit, whist my Kinsman and he joyn\u0027d to consolate me with repeated Proofs of their Friendship; all which my dear Parents approv\u0027d; and promoted their Visits to our House by a generous and kind Reception at our Country Retreat; where they came now and then, a little to relax their College Discipline, and unbend the Streightness of their Study; bringing with them little Books, new Pamphlets, and Songs; and in their Absence, convers\u0027d with me by Writing; sometimes Verse, sometimes Prose, which ingaged my Replies in the same manner. And here, amongst these Papers, appear several of them; out of which, perhaps, your Ladyship may chuse some Patches for your Screen. \n An Invitation to my Learned Friends at Cambridge. \n \n If, Friends, you wou\u0027d but now this Place accost, \n \n E\u0027er the Young Spring that Epithet has lost, \n \n And of my Rural Joys participate, \n \n You\u0027d change your learn\u0027d Harangues for Country Chat, \n \n And thus with me salute this lonely State: \n \n Hail Solitude! where Peace and Vertue shroud \n \n Their unvail\u0027d Beauties, from the censuring Croud; \n \n Let us but have their Company, and we \n \n Shall never envy this World\u0027s Gallantry. \n \n Tho\u0027 to few Objects here we are confin\u0027d, \n \n Yet we have full Inlargement of the Mind. \n \n From varying Modes, which oft our Minds inslave, \n \n Lo! here, a full Immunity we have: \n \n For here\u0027s no Pride, but in the Sun\u0027s bright Beams, \n \n Nor murmuring, but in the Crystal-Streams. \n \n No Avarice, but in the hoarding Bees, \n \n Nor is Ambition found, but in the Trees. \n \n No Emulations ever interpose, \n \n Except betwixt the Tulip and the Rose. \n \n No Wantonness, but in the frisking Lambs; \n \n Nor Luxury, but when they suck their Dams. \n \n No politick Contrivances of State, \n \n Only each Bird contrives to please its Mate. \n \n No Shepherd here of scornful Nymph complains, \n \n Nor are the Nymphs undone by faithless Swains. \n \n Narcissus only, is that sullen He, \n \n That can despise his amorous, talking She. \n \n But all Things here, conspire to make us bless\u0027d; \n \n Whilst true Content is Musick to the Feast. \n \n ???Then hail sweet Solitude! all hail again, \n \n All hail to every Field, and Wood, and Plain; \n \n To every beauteous Nymph, and faithful Swain. \n \n Then join with me; come, join with me, and give \n \n This Salutation; or at least believe, \n \n \u0027Tis such a kind of Solitude, as yet \n \n Romance ne\u0027er found where happy Lovers met. \n \n Yea, such a kind of Solitude it is, \n \n Not much unlike to that of Paradise; \n \n Where Nature does her choicest Goods dispense, \n \n And I, too, here, am plac\u0027d in Innocence. \n \n I should conclude that such it really were, \n \n But that the Tree of Knowledge won\u0027t grow here. \n \n Though in its Culture I have spent some Time, \n \n Yet it disdains to grow in our cold Clime, \n \n Where it can neither Fruit nor Leaves produce, \n \n Good for its Owner, or the publick Use. \n \n Whilst God and Nature for You constitute, \n \n Luxurious Banquets of this dainty Fruit. \n \n Whose Tree most fresh and flourishing is found, \n \n E\u0027er since \u0027twas planted in your fertile Ground. \n \n Whilst you in Wit, grow, as its Branches, high, \n \n Deep as its Root, too, in Philosophy. \n \n Large as its spreading Arms, your Reasons show; \n \n Close as its Shade, your well-knit Judgments grow; \n \n Fresh as its Leaves, your sprouting Fancies are; \n \n Your Vertues like its Fruit, are bright and fair. \n \n This my Invitation they all accepted, plain and innocent as it was, like those Cates, wherewith they were treated; for we search\u0027d not Air, Earth, and Water to gratify our Palates with Dainties, nor ravag\u0027d Spain, France, and the Indies, for Diversity of Liquors: Our own Product, in a cleanly wholsome manner, contented our Appetites; such as serv\u0027d the Conveniency of Life, not superfluous Luxury. Our Correspondence was of the same Piece, vertuous and innocent: No Flear or Grimace tending to Lewdness, or cunning Artifice, out of the Way of Rural Simplicity: But pure and candid, such as might be amongst the Celestial Inhabitants. In this manner it was, that these vertuous Youths relieved my Solitude, and, in some Degree, dissipated that Melancholy wherewith I was oppress\u0027d: And in their Absence (as I said before) visited me with Letters, and little Presents of the newest Pieces of Diversion that came to their Hands. And some of them having complimented me with an Epistle, I wrote the following Answer. \n To my Young Lover. \n \n In cautious Youth! why dost thou so misplace \n \n Thy fine Encomiums, on an o\u0027er-blown Face? \n \n Which after all the Varnish of thy Quill, \n \n Defects and Wrinkles shew conspicuous still; \n \n Nor is it in the Power of Youth, to move \n \n An age-chill\u0027d Heart, to any Strokes of Love. \n \n Then chuse some budding Beauty, which in Time, \n \n May crown thy Wishes, in thy blooming Prime. \n \n For nought can make a more prepost\u0027rous Show, \n \n Than April Flow\u0027rs, stuck on St. Michael\u0027s Bough \n \n To consecrate thy first-born Sighs to me, \n \n A super-annuated Deity, \n \n Makes that Idolatry and deadly Sin, \n \n Which otherwise had only venial been. \n \n This, and some other such, obtain\u0027d of them a friendly Rebuke, for making my self Old, when I was but little more than Twenty. The Truth is, I believe Grief made me think the Time tedious, every Day of Sorrow seeming a Year; insomuch that, according to that Account, I was as old as the Patriarchs before the Flood. I believe it is in this as in other things; we judge according to our Passions, and imagine others should do the same. The fearful Man thinks he sees Spirits, Thieves, and Murderers: The angry Man, if he sees a Straw lie in his Way, believes his Enemy laid it to affront him: The jealous Man mistrusts, and misconstrues even his Wife\u0027s Kindness and Caresses: And so it is on all Occasions of Passion and Fancy. So that when I was out of my Teens, I thought all the Days of Youth were past, and those that could write Twenty, ought to lay all Things youthful and gay aside. But it seems these my young Friends were not of the same Sentiment; but treated me in their eloquent Letters and poetical Epistles, like a very young and beautiful Lady, equal in Years to themselves. Which caus\u0027d me to make this following Reply to one of their Epistles. \n \n To praise, sweet Youth, do thou forbear, \n \n ???Where there is no Desert; \n \n For, alas! Encomiums here, \n \n ???Are Jewels thrown i\u0027th\u0027 Dirt. For I no more deserve Applause, \n \n ???Now Youth and Beauty\u0027s fled, \n \n Than does a Tulip or a Rose, \n \n ???When its fair Leaves are shed. Howe\u0027er, I wish thy Praises may, \n \n ???Like Prayers to Heaven borne, \n \n When holy Souls, for Sinners pray, \n \n ???Upon Thy-self return. \n \n These, Madam, were the little Adventures of my Country Life; not fit Entertainments for your Ladyship, but that your Commands stamp the Character, and make current the meanest Metal, and render that acceptable, which otherwise would hardly be excusable. The Compassion your Ladyship seem\u0027d to have for my Griefs, encourag\u0027d me to let you know by what Steps I climbed out of the deepest Gulph of Sorrow; and how this my mournful Tragedy was chang\u0027d into a kind of innocent Pastoral; as appears by the Ballad I sent to these my young Friends to Sturbridge-Fair. \n A BALLAD. \n By Way of Dialogue between Two Shepherd-Boys. \n FIRST BOY. \n \n I Wonder what Alexis ails, \n \n ???To sigh and talk of Darts; \n \n Of Charms which o\u0027er his Soul prevails, \n \n ???Of Flames and bleeding Hearts. \n \n I saw him Yesterday alone, \n \n ???Walk crossing of his Arms; \n \n And Cuckow-like, was in a Tone, \n \n ???Ah, Celia! ah, thy Charms! \n SECOND BOY. \n \n Why, sure thou\u0027rt not so ignorant, \n \n ???As thou wou\u0027d\u0027st seem to be: \n \n Alas! the Cause of his Complaint, \n \n ???Is all our Destiny. \n \n \u0027Tis mighty Love\u0027s all-pow\u0027rful Bow, \n \n ???Which has Alexis hit; \n \n A powerful Shaft will hit us too, \n \n ???E\u0027er we\u0027re aware of it. \n FIRST BOY. \n \n Why, Love! — Alas! I little thought \n \n ???There had been such a Thing; \n \n But that for Rhime it had been brought, \n \n ???When Shepherds us\u0027d to sing. \n \n And, sure, whate\u0027er they talk of Love, \n \n ???\u0027Tis but Conceit at most; \n \n As Fear i\u0027th\u0027 Dark our Fancies move \n \n ???To think we see a Ghost. \n SECOND BOY. \n \n I know not; but the other Day, \n \n ???A wanton Girl there were, \n \n Which took my Stock-Dove\u0027s Eggs away, \n \n ???And Black-bird\u0027s Nest did tear. \n \n Had it been Thee, my dearest Boy, \n \n ???Revenge I should have took; \n \n But She my Anger did destroy, \n \n ???By the Sweetness of her Look. \n FIRST BOY. \n \n So t\u0027other Day, a wanton Slut, \n \n ???As I slept on the Ground, \n \n A Frog into my Bosom put, \n \n ???My Hands and Feet she bound: \n \n She hung my Hook upon a Tree; \n \n ???Then, laughing bid me wake; \n \n And though she thus abused me, \n \n ???Revenge I cannot take. \n CHORUS. \n \n Let\u0027s wish these Overtures of Fate, \n \n ???Don\u0027t luckless Omens prove; \n \n For those who lose the Power to Hate, \n \n ???Are soon made Slaves to Love. \n \n The young Gentlemen receiv\u0027d it kindly, and return\u0027d me Thanks in these Words. \n \n Dear Galesia, \n We all return you Thanks for your Ballad; to which our Friend Sam Setwell, put a Tune, and we sung it in a Booth merrily, \u0027till the Proctor had like to have spoil\u0027d the Harmony. But he finding no Female amongst us, drank the innocent Author\u0027s Health, and departed. The whole Chorus salute you, with the Assurance of being \n \n Your Humble Servants. \n \n This Conversation, and Correspondence, Madam, infused into me some Thoughts, befitting my Sex and Years, rendering me fit for Company, and to live like the rest of my Fellow-Creatures; so that being one Day where there was a young Gentleman, who did not think me so much a Stoick as I thought myself, he so far lik\u0027d my Person and Humour, that altho\u0027 he had been a very loose Liver, he began to think he could endure to put on Shackles, and be confin\u0027d to one: But being perfectly a Stranger, and knowing not well how to introduce himself into my farther Acquaintance, he took this odd Method. \n \n There was a certain Gossip in those Parts, that used to go between the Ladies and Gentlewomen, with Services, and How-d\u0027ye\u0027s; always carrying with her the little prattling News of Transactions where she frequented. This Woman coming to our House, was receiv\u0027d with a good Mien, and the best Chear our Larder would afford, which was my Office to perform. She took the Opportunity to tell me, that her coming at that Time was particularly to Me, from Mr. Bellair, who had seen me the other Day at such a Place, since which time he had had no Repose, nor none could have, \u0027till I gave him Leave to make me a Visit, which he begg\u0027d most earnestly. To which I reply\u0027d, That though Mr. Bellair had seen me, he was perfectly a Stranger to me, otherwise he had not sent such a Message; he knowing that I lived in my Father\u0027s House, not in my own; therefore had no right to invite or receive any-body unknown to my Parents, much less young Gentlemen; that being an Irregularity misbecoming my Sex and Station, and the Character of a dutiful Daughter: This I desir\u0027d her to tell him, with my Service; which Answer I utter\u0027d with a little Sharpness, that the Woman could not but see her Errand was disobliging, as it was, and ought to be; such a Message looking more like a dishonourable Intrigue, than an Address to a vertuous Maiden-Gentlewoman. The Truth is, I always had an Aversion to those secret Addresses, as all vertuous Maids ought, and was resolved as carefully to avoid them as Mariners do Rocks; for \u0027tis certain, that Parents are naturally willing to promote their Childrens Happiness; and therefore, that Lover who desires to keep the Parents in the Dark, is conscious to himself of something that has need to shun the Light; for his Concealing his Pretentions from the Mother, looks as if he meant an unworthy Conquest on the Daughter; and especially those of Mr. Bellair\u0027s Character. \n \n However, I mistook my young Gentleman, his Intentions being more sincere than I expected: For upon that Answer to my Gossip, he took the first Occasion to discover his Sentiments to his Father; who did not only approve, but rejoyced there at, hoping that he was in a Disposition to reclaim himself from his loose Way of Living; and that the Company of a Wife, and Care of a Family, wou\u0027d totally wean him from those wild Companions, in whom he too much delighted: Not but that his Father had divers times offered, and earnestly persuaded him, to dispose himself for a Married Life, having no Son but him, to inherit his Riches, and continue his Family. To which the young Man was ever averse; counting Marriage as Fetters and Shackles, a Confinement not to be borne by the Young and the Witty; a Wife being suppos\u0027d to be the Destruction of all Pleasure and good Humour, and a Death to all the Felicities of Life; only good in the Declension of Years, when Coughs and Aches oblige a Man to his own Fire-side: then a Nurse is a most necessary Utensil in a House. These and the like, us\u0027d to be the wild Notions, wherewith he oppos\u0027d his Father\u0027s indulgent Care, whenever he went about to provide for his happy Establishment: So the good old Gentleman was overjoy\u0027d at his Son\u0027s own Proposal, and took the first Opportunity with my Father, over a Bottle, to deliver his Son\u0027s Errand. To which my Father answer\u0027d, like a plain Country Gentleman, as he was (who never gilded his Actions with fraudulent Words, nor painted his Words with deceitful or double Meanings;) and told him, \"That he was very sensible of the Honour he did him in this Proposal; but that he cou\u0027d not make his Daughter a Fortune suitable to his Estate: For, continued he, that becoming Way in which we live, is more the Effect of prudent Management, than any real Existence of Riches.\" To which the old Gentleman reply\u0027d, \"That Riches were not what he sought in a Wife for his Son; Fortune having been so propitious to him, that he needed not to make that his greatest Care: A prudent, vertuous Woman, was what he most aim\u0027d at, in his Son\u0027s Espousals, hoping that such an one, would reclaim and wean him from all those wild Excursions to which Youth and Ill-Company had drawn him, to his great Affliction. But, methinks, continu\u0027d he, I spy a Dawn of Reformation in the Choice he has made of your Daughter; who, amongst all the young Gentlewomen of these Parts, I value, she having a distinguishing Character for Prudence and Vertue, capable to command Respect and Esteem from all the World; as well as does her amiable Person ingage my Son\u0027s Affections. Wherefore, said he, I hope you will not refuse your Concurrence, thereby to make my Son happy.\" My Father making him a grateful Acknowledgment, told him, \"He wou\u0027d propose it to my Mother and me; and added, That his Daughter having been always dutiful and tenderly observant, he resolv\u0027d to be indulgent, and impose nothing contrary to her Inclinations. Her Mother also, continu\u0027d he, has been a Person of that Prudence and Vertue, that I should not render the Justice due to her Merit, if I did any thing of this kind, without her Approbation.\" \n \n This my Father related to me, with an Air full of Kindness, telling me, That he wou\u0027d leave the Affair wholly to my Determination; adding, That there was an Estate, full Coffers, and a brisk young Gentleman; So that I think (said he) I need say no more to a Person of common Sense, to comply with what is so advantageous. \n \n To which I reply\u0027d, \"That these or any of these, were above my Desert; and your Recommendations, Sir, redouble the Value; upon whose Wisdom and paternal Care I ought wholly to depend: But his particular loose Way of Living, I hope will justify me, when I lay that before you, as a Cause of Hesitation.\" To which my Mother reply\u0027d, \"That it must be my Part, with Mildness and Sweetness, to reclaim him: That he having now sow\u0027d his wild Oats, (according to the Proverb) wou\u0027d see his Folly; and finding there is nothing to be reap\u0027d but Noise, Vanity, and Disgrace, in all Probability, wou\u0027d apply himself to another Way of Living; especially having made the Proposal to his Father of settling with a Person of his own choosing, where no Interest nor Family-Necessity had any Hand in the Election.\" \n \n These and the like Discourses and Considerations, pass\u0027d among us; we having his Father\u0027s serious Proposal for our Foundation; which, join\u0027d with the Message he himself had sent me by the Gossip, we had Reason to believe the Superstructure would not be defective. \n \n Nevertheless, though I was but an innocent Country Girl, yet I was not so ignorant of the World, but to know or believe, that often those Beau Rakes, have the Cunning and Assurance to make Parents on both sides, Steps to their Childrens Disgrace, if not Ruin: For very often, good Country Ladies, who reflect not on the Vileness of the World, permit their Daughters to give private Audiences, to their Lovers, in some obscure Arbour or distant Drawing-room; where the Spark has Opportunity to misbehave himself to the Lady; which, if she resent, there is a ready Conveniency for him to bespatter her with Scandal. And I did not know but Bellair might have some such thing in his Thoughts, out of Malice for my having rejected his Intrigue by the Gossip. For I could not fancy my-self endow\u0027d with Charms sufficient to hold fast such a Volage; however, I knew my self safe under my Mother\u0027s Prudence, and my own Resolution. \n \n And thus I expected my pretended Lover some Days; But instead of his personal Appearance, News came, That he was taken in a Robbery on the High-way, and committed to the County-Gaol: And all this out of a Frolick; for tho\u0027 he had all Things necessary, both for Conveniency and Diversion, nevertheless, this detestable Frolick must needs be put in Practice, with some of his lewd Companions; for which at the next Assizes, he receiv\u0027d the Reward of his Crimes at the Place of publick Execution. \n \n I have told you this Transaction, that your Ladyship may not be ignorant of any thing that appertains to me, though this was an Affair utterly unknown to all the World; I mean his Proposal of Marriage; nor does any of my Poems take the least Notice, or give any Hint of it; for there was no Progress made by any personal Correspondence, nor can I persuade my-self he meant any thing but Mischief. \n \n I cou\u0027d recount to your Ladyship another Story or two of odd Disappointments; but, they will take up too great a Place in your Screen, and render the View disagreeable. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1233/37079.html","bookId":60,"book":{"id":60,"title":"A Patch-Work Screen for the Ladies","description":"简介： When we parted from Galesia last, it was in St. Germain\u0027s Garden; and now we meet with her in England, travelling in a Stage-Coach from London Northward; where she had the Luck to meet with good Company, who entertained each other agreeably with Thin...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1233","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
