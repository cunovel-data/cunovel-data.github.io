[bbe] Having become by so much better than the angels, as the name which is his heritage is more noble than theirs. 1:5 [hgb] 所 有 的 天 使 ， 神 从 来 对 那 一 个 说 ， 你 是 我 的 儿 子 ， 我 今 日 生 你 。 又 指 着 那 一 个 说 ， 我 要 作 他 的 父 ， 他 要 作 我 的 子 。 [kjv] For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son? [bbe] To which of the angels did God say at any time, You are my Son, this day I have given you being? or, I will be his Father, and he will be my Son? 1:6 [hgb] 再 者 ， 神 使 长 子 到 世 上 来 的 时 候 ， （ 或 作 神 再 使 长 子 到 世 上 来 的 时 候 ） 就 说 ， 神 的 使 者 都 要 拜 他 。 [kjv] And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him. [bbe] And again, when he is sending his only Son into the world, he says, Let all the angels of God give him worship. 1:7 [hgb] 论 到 使 者 ， 又 说 ， 神 以 风 为 使 者 ， 以 火 焰 为 仆 役 。 [kjv] And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire. [bbe] And of the angels he says, Who makes his angels winds, and his servants flames of fire: 1:8 [hgb] 论 到 子 却 说 ， 神 阿 ， 你 的 宝 座 是 永 永 远 远 的 ， 你 的 国 权 是 正 直 的 。 [kjv] But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom. [bbe] But of the Son he says, Your seat of power, O God, is for ever and ever; and the rod of your kingdom is a rod of righteousness. 1:9 [hgb] 你 喜 爱 公 义 ， 恨 恶 罪 恶 。 所 以 神 就 是 你 的 神 ， 用 喜 乐 油 膏 你 ， 胜 过 膏 你 的 同 伴 。 [kjv] Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows. [bbe] You have been a lover of righteousness and a hater of evil; and so God, your God, has put the oil of joy on your head more than on the heads of those who are with you. 1:10 [hgb] 又 说 ， 主 阿 ， 你 起 初 立 了 地 的 根 基 ， 天 也 是 你 手 所 造 的 。 [kjv] And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands: [bbe] You, Lord, at the first did put the earth on its base, and the heavens are the works of your hands: 1:11 [hgb] 天 地 都 要 灭 没 ， 你 却 要 长 存 。 天 地 都 要 像 衣 服 渐 渐 旧 了 。 [kjv] They shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment; [bbe] They will come to their end; but you are for ever; they will become old as a robe; 1:12 [hgb] 你 要 将 天 地 卷 起 来 ， 像 一 件 外 衣 ， 天 地 就 都 改 变 了 。 惟 有 你 永 不 改 变 ， 你 的 年 数 没 有 穷 尽 。 [kjv] And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail. [bbe] They will be rolled up like a cloth, even like a robe, and they will be changed: but you are the same and your years will have no end. 1:13 [hgb] 所 有 的 天 使 ， 神 从 来 对 那 一 个 说 ， 你 坐 在 我 的 右 边 ， 等 我 使 你 仇 敌 作 你 的 脚 凳 。 [kjv] But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool? [bbe] But of which of the angels has he said at any time, Take your seat at my right hand till I put all those who are against you under your feet? 1:14 [hgb] 天 使 岂 不 都 是 服 役 的 灵 ， 奉 差 遣 为 那 将 要 承 受 救 恩 的 人 效 力 吗 ？ [kjv] Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation? [bbe] Are they not all helping spirits, who are sent out as servants to those whose heritage will be salvation?","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/183/2331.html","bookId":65,"book":{"id":65,"title":"希伯来书 Hebrews","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 神 既 在 古 时 借 着 众 先 知 ， 多 次 多 方 的 晓 谕 列 祖 ， [kjv] God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, \u0026n...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/183","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:28 AM"}}
