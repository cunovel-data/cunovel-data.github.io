{"id":1882,"no":8,"title":"Chapter 8","content":"8:1 [hgb] 我 们 所 讲 的 事 ， 其 中 第 一 要 紧 的 ， 就 是 我 们 有 这 样 的 大 祭 司 ， 已 经 坐 在 天 上 至 大 者 宝 座 的 右 边 ， \n [kjv] Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens; \n [bbe] Now of the things we are saying this is the chief point: We have such a high priest, who has taken his place at the right hand of God\u0027s high seat of glory in heaven, \n 8:2 [hgb] 在 圣 所 ， 就 是 真 帐 幕 里 ， 作 执 事 。 这 帐 幕 是 主 所 支 的 ， 不 是 人 所 支 的 。 \n [kjv] A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man. \n [bbe] As a servant of the holy things and of the true Tent, which was put up by God, not by man. \n 8:3 [hgb] 凡 大 祭 司 都 是 为 献 礼 物 和 祭 物 设 立 的 。 所 以 这 位 大 祭 司 也 必 须 有 所 献 的 。 \n [kjv] For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer. \n [bbe] Now every high priest is given authority to take to God the things which are given and to make offerings; so that it is necessary for this man, like them, to have something for an offering. \n 8:4 [hgb] 他 若 在 地 上 ， 必 不 得 为 祭 司 ， 因 为 已 经 有 照 律 法 献 礼 物 的 祭 司 。 \n [kjv] For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law: \n [bbe] If he had been on earth he would not have been a priest at all, because there are other priests who make the offerings ordered by the law; \n 8:5 [hgb] 他 们 供 奉 的 事 ， 本 是 天 上 事 的 形 状 和 影 像 ， 正 如 摩 西 将 要 造 帐 幕 的 时 候 ， 蒙 神 警 戒 他 ， 说 ， 你 要 谨 慎 ， 作 各 样 的 物 件 ， 都 要 照 着 在 山 上 指 示 你 的 样 式 。 \n [kjv] Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount. \n [bbe] Being servants of that which is a copy and an image of the things in heaven, as Moses, when he was about to make the Tent, had special orders from God: for, See, he said, that you make everything like the design which you saw in the mountain. \n 8:6 [hgb] 如 今 耶 稣 所 得 的 职 任 是 更 美 的 ， 正 如 他 作 更 美 之 约 的 中 保 。 这 约 原 是 凭 更 美 之 应 许 立 的 。 \n [kjv] But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises. \n [bbe] But now his position as priest is higher. because through him God has made a better agreement with man, based on the giving of better things. \n 8:7 [hgb] 那 前 约 若 没 有 瑕 疵 ， 就 无 处 寻 求 后 约 了 。 \n [kjv] For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second. \n [bbe] For if that first agreement had been as good as possible, there would have been no place for a second. \n 8:8 [hgb] 所 以 主 指 责 他 的 百 姓 说 ， （ 或 作 所 以 主 指 前 约 的 缺 欠 说 ） 日 子 将 到 ， 我 要 与 以 色 列 家 ， 和 犹 大 家 ， 另 立 新 约 。 \n [kjv] For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah: \n [bbe] For, protesting against them, he says, See, the days are coming when I will make a new agreement with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah; \n 8:9 [hgb] 不 像 我 拉 着 他 们 祖 宗 的 手 ， 领 他 们 出 埃 及 的 时 候 ， 与 他 们 所 立 的 约 。 因 为 他 们 不 恒 心 守 我 的 约 ， 我 也 不 理 他 们 。 这 是 主 说 的 。 \n [kjv] Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord. \n [bbe] Not like the agreement which I made with their fathers when I took them by the hand, to be their guide out of the land of Egypt; for they did not keep the agreement with me, and I gave them up, says the Lord. \n 8:10 [hgb] 主 又 说 ， 那 些 日 子 以 后 ， 我 与 以 色 列 家 所 立 的 约 乃 是 这 样 。 我 要 将 我 的 律 法 放 在 他 们 里 面 ， 写 在 他 们 心 上 ， 我 要 作 他 们 的 神 ， 他 们 要 作 我 的 子 民 。 \n [kjv] For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people: \n [bbe] For this is the agreement which I will make with the people of Israel after those days: I will put my laws into their minds, writing them in their hearts: and I will be their God, and they will be my people: \n 8:11 [hgb] 他 们 不 用 各 人 教 导 自 己 的 乡 邻 ， 和 自 己 的 弟 兄 ， 说 ， 你 该 认 识 主 。 因 为 他 们 从 最 小 的 到 至 大 的 ， 都 必 认 识 我 。 \n [kjv] And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest. \n [bbe] And there will be no need for every man to be teaching his brother, or his neighbour, saying, This is the knowledge of the Lord: for they will all have knowledge of me, great and small. \n 8:12 [hgb] 我 要 宽 恕 他 们 的 不 义 ， 不 再 记 念 他 们 的 罪 愆 。 \n [kjv] For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more. \n [bbe] And I will have mercy on their evil-doing, and I will not keep their sins in mind. \n 8:13 [hgb] 既 说 新 约 ， 就 以 前 约 为 旧 了 。 但 那 渐 旧 渐 衰 的 ， 就 必 快 归 无 有 了 。 \n [kjv] In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away. \n [bbe] When he says, A new agreement, he has made the first agreement old. But anything which is getting old and past use will not be seen much longer. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/183/2338.html","bookId":65,"book":{"id":65,"title":"希伯来书 Hebrews","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 神 既 在 古 时 借 着 众 先 知 ， 多 次 多 方 的 晓 谕 列 祖 ， [kjv] God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, \u0026n...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/183","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:28 AM"}}
