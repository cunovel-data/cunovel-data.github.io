{"id":1886,"no":12,"title":"Chapter 12","content":"12:1 [hgb] 我 们 既 有 这 许 多 的 见 证 人 ， 如 同 云 彩 围 着 我 们 ， 就 当 放 下 各 样 的 重 担 ， 脱 去 容 易 缠 累 我 们 的 罪 ， 存 心 忍 耐 ， 奔 那 摆 在 我 们 前 头 的 路 程 ， [kjv] Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us, [bbe] For this reason, as we are circled by so great a cloud of witnesses, putting off every weight, and the sin into which we come so readily, let us keep on running in the way which is marked out for us, 12:2 [hgb] 仰 望 为 我 们 信 心 创 始 成 终 的 耶 稣 。 （ 或 作 仰 望 那 将 真 道 创 始 成 终 的 耶 稣 ） 他 因 那 摆 在 前 面 的 喜 乐 ， 就 轻 看 羞 辱 ， 忍 受 了 十 字 架 的 苦 难 ， 便 坐 在 神 宝 座 的 右 边 。 [kjv] Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God. [bbe] Having our eyes fixed on Jesus, the guide and end of our faith, who went through the pains of the cross, not caring for the shame, because of the joy which was before him, and who has now taken his place at the right hand of God\u0027s seat of power. 12:3 [hgb] 那 忍 受 罪 人 这 样 顶 撞 的 ， 你 们 要 思 想 ， 免 得 疲 倦 灰 心 。 [kjv] For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds. [bbe] Give thought to him who has undergone so much of the hate of sinners against himself, so that you may not be tired and feeble of purpose. 12:4 [hgb] 你 们 与 罪 恶 相 争 ， 还 没 有 抵 挡 到 流 血 的 地 步 。 [kjv] Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin. [bbe] Till now you have not given your blood in your fight against sin: 12:5 [hgb] 你 们 又 忘 了 那 劝 你 们 如 同 劝 儿 子 的 话 ， 说 ， 我 儿 ， 你 不 可 轻 看 主 的 管 教 ， 被 他 责 备 的 时 候 ， 也 不 可 灰 心 。 [kjv] And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him: [bbe] And you have not kept in mind the word which says to you as to sons, My son, do not make little of the Lord\u0027s punishment, and do not give up hope when you are judged by him; 12:6 [hgb] 因 为 主 所 爱 的 他 必 管 教 ， 又 鞭 打 凡 所 收 纳 的 儿 子 。 [kjv] For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth. [bbe] For the Lord sends punishment on his loved ones; everyone whom he takes as his son has experience of his rod. 12:7 [hgb] 你 们 所 忍 受 的 ， 是 神 管 教 你 们 ， 待 你 们 如 同 待 儿 子 。 焉 有 儿 子 不 被 父 亲 管 教 的 呢 ？ [kjv] If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not? [bbe] It is for your training that you undergo these things; God is acting to you as a father does to his sons; for what son does not have punishment from his father? 12:8 [hgb] 管 教 原 是 众 子 所 共 受 的 ， 你 们 若 不 受 管 教 ， 就 是 私 子 ， 不 是 儿 子 了 。 [kjv] But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons. [bbe] But if you have not that punishment of which we all have our part, then you are not true sons, but children of shame. 12:9 [hgb] 再 者 ， 我 们 曾 有 生 身 的 父 管 教 我 们 ， 我 们 尚 且 敬 重 他 ， 何 况 万 灵 的 父 ， 我 们 岂 不 更 当 顺 服 他 得 生 吗 ？ [kjv] Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live? [bbe] And again, if the fathers of our flesh gave us punishment and had our respect, how much more will we be under the authority of the Father of spirits, and have life? 12:10 [hgb] 生 身 的 父 都 是 暂 随 己 意 管 教 我 们 。 惟 有 万 灵 的 父 管 教 我 们 ， 是 要 我 们 得 益 处 ， 使 我 们 在 他 的 圣 洁 上 有 分 。 [kjv] For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness. [bbe] For they truly gave us punishment for a short time, as it seemed good to them; but he does it for our profit, so that we may become holy as he is. 12:11 [hgb] 凡 管 教 的 事 ， 当 时 不 觉 得 快 乐 ， 反 觉 得 愁 苦 。 后 来 却 为 那 经 练 过 的 人 ， 结 出 平 安 的 果 子 ， 就 是 义 。 [kjv] Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby. [bbe] At the time all punishment seems to be pain and not joy: but after, those who have been trained by it get from it the peace-giving fruit of righteousness. 12:12 [hgb] 所 以 你 们 要 把 下 垂 的 手 ， 发 酸 的 腿 ， 挺 起 来 。 [kjv] Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees; [bbe] For this cause let the hands which are hanging down be lifted up, and let the feeble knees be made strong, 12:13 [hgb] 也 要 为 自 己 的 脚 把 道 路 修 直 了 ， 使 瘸 子 不 至 歪 脚 ， 反 得 痊 愈 。 （ 歪 脚 或 作 差 路 ） [kjv] And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed. [bbe] And make straight roads for your feet, so that the feeble may not be turned out of the way, but may be made strong. 12:14 [hgb] 你 们 要 追 求 与 众 人 和 睦 ， 并 要 追 求 圣 洁 。 非 圣 洁 没 有 人 能 见 主 。 [kjv] Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord: [bbe] Let your desire be for peace with all men, and to be made holy, without which no man may see the Lord; 12:15 [hgb] 又 要 谨 慎 ， 恐 怕 有 人 失 了 神 的 恩 。 恐 怕 有 毒 根 生 出 来 扰 乱 你 们 ， 因 此 叫 众 人 沾 染 污 秽 。 [kjv] Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled; [bbe] Looking with care to see that no man among you in his behaviour comes short of the grace of God; for fear that some bitter root may come up to be a trouble to you, and that some of you may be made unclean by it; 12:16 [hgb] 恐 怕 有 淫 乱 的 ， 有 贪 恋 世 俗 如 以 扫 的 。 他 因 一 点 食 物 把 自 己 长 子 的 名 分 卖 了 。 [kjv] Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright. [bbe] And that there may not be any evil liver, or any man without respect for God, like Esau, who let his birthright go for a plate of food. 12:17 [hgb] 后 来 想 要 承 受 父 所 祝 的 福 ， 竟 被 弃 绝 ， 虽 然 号 哭 切 求 ， 却 得 不 着 门 路 ， 使 他 父 亲 的 心 意 回 转 ， 这 是 你 们 知 道 的 。 [kjv] For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears. [bbe] For you have knowledge that even long after, when he was desiring the blessing for his heritage, he was turned away, though he made his request frequently and with weeping; because the past might not be changed. 12:18 [hgb] 你 们 原 不 是 来 到 那 能 摸 的 山 ， 此 山 有 火 焰 ， 密 云 ， 黑 暗 ， 暴 风 ， [kjv] For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest, [bbe] You have not come to a mountain which may be touched, and is burning with fire, and to a black cloud, and a dark smoke, and a violent wind, 12:19 [hgb] 角 声 与 说 话 的 声 音 。 那 些 听 见 这 声 音 的 。 都 求 不 要 再 向 他 们 说 话 。 [kjv] And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which voice they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more: [bbe] And to the sound of a horn, and the voice of words, the hearers of which made request that not a word more might be said to them: 12:20 [hgb] 因 为 他 们 当 不 起 所 命 他 们 的 话 说 ， 靠 近 这 山 的 ， 即 便 是 走 兽 ， 也 要 用 石 头 打 死 。 [kjv] (For they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a dart: [bbe] For the order which said, If the mountain is touched even by a beast, the beast is to be stoned, seemed hard to them; 12:21 [hgb] 所 见 的 极 其 可 怕 ， 甚 至 摩 西 说 ， 我 甚 是 恐 惧 战 兢 。 [kjv] And so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:) [bbe] And the vision was so overpowering that even Moses said, I am shaking and full of fear. 12:22 [hgb] 你 们 乃 是 来 到 锡 安 山 ， 永 生 神 的 城 邑 ， 就 是 天 上 的 耶 路 撒 冷 。 那 里 有 千 万 的 天 使 ， [kjv] But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels, [bbe] But you have come to the mountain of Zion, to the place of the living God, to the Jerusalem which is in heaven, and to an army of angels which may not be numbered, 12:23 [hgb] 有 名 录 在 天 上 诸 长 子 之 会 所 共 聚 的 总 会 ， 有 审 判 众 人 的 神 ， 和 被 成 全 之 义 人 的 灵 魂 。 [kjv] To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect, [bbe] To the great meeting and church of the first of those who are named in heaven, and to God the judge of all, and to the spirits of good men made complete, 12:24 [hgb] 并 新 约 的 中 保 耶 稣 ， 以 及 所 洒 的 血 。 这 血 所 说 的 比 亚 伯 的 血 所 说 的 更 美 。 [kjv] And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel. [bbe] And to Jesus by whom the new agreement has been made between God and man, and to the sign of the blood which says better things than Abel\u0027s blood. 12:25 [hgb] 你 们 总 要 谨 慎 ， 不 可 弃 绝 那 向 你 们 说 话 的 。 因 为 那 些 弃 绝 在 地 上 警 戒 他 们 的 ， 尚 且 不 能 逃 罪 ， 何 况 我 们 违 背 那 从 天 上 警 戒 我 们 的 呢 ？ [kjv] See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven: [bbe] See that you give ear to his voice which comes to you. For if those whose ears were shut to the voice which came to them on earth did not go free from punishment, what chance have we of going free if we give no attention to him whose voice comes from heaven? 12:26 [hgb] 当 时 他 的 声 音 震 动 了 地 。 但 如 今 他 应 许 说 ， 再 一 次 我 不 单 要 震 动 地 ， 还 要 震 动 天 。 [kjv] Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven. [bbe] Whose voice was the cause of the shaking of the earth; but now he has made an oath, saying, There will be still one more shaking, not only of the earth, but of heaven. 12:27 [hgb] 这 再 一 次 的 话 ， 是 指 明 被 震 动 的 ， 就 是 受 造 之 物 ， 都 要 挪 去 ， 使 那 不 被 震 动 的 常 存 。 [kjv] And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain. [bbe] And the words, Still one more, make it clear that there will be a taking away of those things which are shaking, as of things which are made, so that there may be only those things of which no shaking is possible. 12:28 [hgb] 所 以 我 们 既 得 了 不 能 震 动 的 国 ， 就 当 感 恩 ， 照 神 所 喜 悦 的 ， 用 虔 诚 敬 畏 的 心 事 奉 神 。 [kjv] Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear: [bbe] If then, we have a kingdom which will never be moved, let us have grace, so that we may give God such worship as is pleasing to him with fear and respect: 12:29 [hgb] 因 为 我 们 的 神 乃 是 烈 火 。 [kjv] For our God is a consuming fire. [bbe] For our God is an all-burning fire.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/183/2342.html","bookId":65,"book":{"id":65,"title":"希伯来书 Hebrews","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 神 既 在 古 时 借 着 众 先 知 ， 多 次 多 方 的 晓 谕 列 祖 ， [kjv] God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, \u0026n...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/183","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:28 AM"}}
