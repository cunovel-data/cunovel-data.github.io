{"id":1880,"no":6,"title":"Chapter 6","content":"6:1 [hgb] 所 以 我 们 应 当 离 开 基 督 道 理 的 开 端 ， 竭 力 进 到 完 全 的 地 步 。 不 必 再 立 根 基 ， 就 如 那 懊 悔 死 行 ， 信 靠 神 ， [kjv] Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God, [bbe] For this reason let us go on from the first things about Christ to full growth; not building again that on which it is based, that is, the turning of the heart from dead works, and faith in God, 6:2 [hgb] 各 样 洗 礼 ， 按 手 之 礼 ， 死 人 复 活 ， 以 及 永 远 审 判 ， 各 等 教 训 。 [kjv] Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment. [bbe] The teaching of baptisms, and of the putting on of hands, and of the future life of the dead, and of the judging on the last day. 6:3 [hgb] 神 若 许 我 们 ， 我 们 必 如 此 行 。 [kjv] And this will we do, if God permit. [bbe] Now we will do this, if God lets us. 6:4 [hgb] 论 到 那 些 已 经 蒙 了 光 照 ， 尝 过 天 恩 的 滋 味 ， 又 于 圣 灵 有 分 ， [kjv] For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, [bbe] As for those who at one time saw the light, tasting the good things from heaven, and having their part in the Holy Spirit, 6:5 [hgb] 并 尝 过 神 善 道 的 滋 味 ， 觉 悟 来 世 权 能 的 人 ， [kjv] And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come, [bbe] With knowledge of the good word of God, and of the powers of the coming time, 6:6 [hgb] 若 是 离 弃 道 理 ， 就 不 能 叫 他 们 从 新 懊 悔 了 。 因 为 他 们 把 神 的 儿 子 重 钉 十 字 架 ， 明 明 地 羞 辱 他 。 [kjv] If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame. [bbe] And then let themselves be turned away, it is not possible for their hearts to be made new a second time; because they themselves put the Son of God on the cross again, openly shaming him. 6:7 [hgb] 就 如 一 块 田 地 ， 吃 过 屡 次 下 的 雨 水 ， 生 长 菜 蔬 合 乎 耕 种 的 人 用 ， 就 从 神 得 福 。 [kjv] For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God: [bbe] For a land, drinking in the frequent rain and producing good plants for those for whom it is worked, has a blessing from God: 6:8 [hgb] 若 长 荆 棘 和 蒺 藜 ， 必 被 废 弃 ， 近 于 咒 诅 ， 结 局 就 是 焚 烧 。 [kjv] But that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected, and is nigh unto cursing; whose end is to be burned. [bbe] But if it sends up thorns and evil plants, it is of no use and is ready to be cursed; its only end is to be burned. 6:9 [hgb] 亲 爱 的 弟 兄 们 ， 我 们 虽 是 这 样 说 ， 却 深 信 你 们 的 行 为 强 过 这 些 ， 而 且 近 乎 得 救 。 [kjv] But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak. [bbe] But, my loved ones, though we say this, we are certain that you have better things in you, things which go with salvation; 6:10 [hgb] 因 为 神 并 非 不 公 义 ， 竟 忘 记 你 们 所 作 的 工 ， 和 你 们 为 他 名 所 显 的 爱 心 ， 就 是 先 前 伺 候 圣 徒 ， 如 今 还 是 伺 候 。 [kjv] For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister. [bbe] For God is true, and will not put away from him the memory of your work and of your love for his name, in the help which you gave and still give to the saints. 6:11 [hgb] 我 们 愿 你 们 各 人 都 显 出 这 样 的 殷 勤 ， 使 你 们 有 满 足 的 指 望 ， 一 直 到 底 。 [kjv] And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end: [bbe] And it is our desire that you may all keep the same high purpose in certain hope to the end: 6:12 [hgb] 并 且 不 懈 怠 。 总 要 效 法 那 些 凭 信 心 和 忍 耐 承 受 应 许 的 人 。 [kjv] That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises. [bbe] So that you may not be slow in heart, but may take as your example those to whom God has given their heritage, because of their faith and their long waiting. 6:13 [hgb] 当 初 神 应 许 亚 伯 拉 罕 的 时 候 ， 因 为 没 有 比 自 己 更 大 可 以 指 着 起 誓 的 ， 就 指 着 自 己 起 誓 说 ， [kjv] For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself, [bbe] For when God made his oath to Abraham, because there was no greater oath, he made it by himself, 6:14 [hgb] 论 福 ， 我 必 赐 大 福 给 你 。 论 子 孙 ， 我 必 叫 你 的 子 孙 多 起 来 。 [kjv] Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee. [bbe] Saying, Be certain that I will give you my blessing, and make your numbers very great. 6:15 [hgb] 这 样 ， 亚 伯 拉 罕 既 恒 久 忍 耐 ， 就 得 了 所 应 许 的 。 [kjv] And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise. [bbe] And so, when he had been waiting calmly for a long time, God\u0027s word to him was put into effect. 6:16 [hgb] 人 都 是 指 着 比 自 己 大 的 起 誓 。 并 且 以 起 誓 为 实 据 ， 了 结 各 样 的 争 论 。 [kjv] For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife. [bbe] For men at all times make their oaths by what is greater; and any argument is ended by the decision of the oath. 6:17 [hgb] 照 样 ， 神 愿 意 为 那 承 受 应 许 的 人 ， 格 外 显 明 他 的 旨 意 是 不 更 改 的 ， 就 起 誓 为 证 。 [kjv] Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath: [bbe] So that when it was God\u0027s desire to make it specially clear to those who by his word were to have the heritage, that his purpose was fixed, he made it more certain with an oath; 6:18 [hgb] 借 这 两 件 不 更 改 的 事 ， 神 决 不 能 说 谎 ， 好 叫 我 们 这 逃 往 避 难 所 ， 持 定 摆 在 我 们 前 头 指 望 的 人 ， 可 以 大 得 勉 励 。 [kjv] That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us: [bbe] So that we, who have gone in flight from danger to the hope which has been put before us, may have a strong comfort in two unchanging things, in which it is not possible for God to be false; 6:19 [hgb] 我 们 有 这 指 望 如 同 灵 魂 的 锚 ， 又 坚 固 又 牢 靠 ， 且 通 入 幔 内 。 [kjv] Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil; [bbe] And this hope is like a strong band for our souls, fixed and certain, and going in to that which is inside the veil; 6:20 [hgb] 作 先 锋 的 耶 稣 ， 既 照 着 麦 基 洗 德 的 等 次 ， 成 了 永 远 的 大 祭 司 ， 就 为 我 们 进 入 幔 内 。 [kjv] Whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec. [bbe] Where Jesus has gone before us, as a high priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/183/2336.html","bookId":65,"book":{"id":65,"title":"希伯来书 Hebrews","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 神 既 在 古 时 借 着 众 先 知 ， 多 次 多 方 的 晓 谕 列 祖 ， [kjv] God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, \u0026n...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/183","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:28 AM"}}
