[bbe] Who kept faith with God who gave him his place, even as Moses did in all his house. 3:3 [hgb] 他 比 摩 西 算 是 更 配 多 得 荣 耀 ， 好 像 建 造 房 屋 的 比 房 屋 更 尊 荣 。 [kjv] For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house. [bbe] And it was right for this man to have more honour than Moses, even as the builder of a house has more honour than the house. 3:4 [hgb] 因 为 房 屋 都 必 有 人 建 造 。 但 建 造 万 物 的 就 是 神 。 [kjv] For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all things is God. [bbe] For every house has a builder; but the builder of all things is God. 3:5 [hgb] 摩 西 为 仆 人 ， 在 神 的 全 家 诚 然 尽 忠 ， 为 要 证 明 将 来 必 传 说 的 事 。 [kjv] And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after; [bbe] And Moses certainly kept faith as a servant, in all his house, and as a witness of those things which were to be said later; 3:6 [hgb] 但 基 督 为 儿 子 ， 治 理 神 的 家 。 我 们 若 将 可 夸 的 盼 望 和 胆 量 ， 坚 持 到 底 ， 便 是 他 的 家 了 。 [kjv] But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end. [bbe] But Christ as a son, over his house; whose house are we, if we keep our hearts fixed in the glad and certain hope till the end. 3:7 [hgb] 圣 灵 有 话 说 ， 你 们 今 日 若 听 他 的 话 ， [kjv] Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice, [bbe] And so, as the Holy Spirit says, Today if you let his voice come to your ears, 3:8 [hgb] 就 不 可 硬 着 心 ， 像 在 旷 野 惹 他 发 怒 ， 试 探 他 的 时 候 一 样 。 [kjv] Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness: [bbe] Be not hard of heart, as when you made me angry, on the day of testing in the waste land, 3:9 [hgb] 在 那 里 ， 你 们 的 祖 宗 试 我 探 我 ， 并 且 观 看 我 的 作 为 ， 有 四 十 年 之 久 。 [kjv] When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years. [bbe] When your fathers put me to the test, and saw my works for forty years. 3:10 [hgb] 所 以 我 厌 烦 那 世 代 的 人 ， 说 ， 他 们 心 里 常 常 迷 糊 ， 竟 不 晓 得 我 的 作 为 。 [kjv] Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway err in their heart; and they have not known my ways. [bbe] So that I was angry with this generation, and I said, Their hearts are in error at all times, and they have no knowledge of my ways; 3:11 [hgb] 我 就 在 怒 中 起 誓 说 ， 他 们 断 不 可 进 入 我 的 安 息 。 [kjv] So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.) [bbe] And being angry I made an oath, saying, They may not come into my rest. 3:12 [hgb] 弟 兄 们 ， 你 们 要 谨 慎 ， 免 得 你 们 中 间 ， 或 有 人 存 着 不 信 的 恶 心 ， 把 永 生 神 离 弃 了 。 [kjv] Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God. [bbe] My brothers, take care that there is not by chance in any one of you an evil heart without belief, turning away from the living God: 3:13 [hgb] 总 要 趁 着 还 有 今 日 ， 天 天 彼 此 相 劝 ， 免 得 你 们 中 间 ， 有 人 被 罪 迷 惑 ， 心 里 就 刚 硬 了 。 [kjv] But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. [bbe] But give comfort to one another every day as long as it is still Today; so that no one among you may be made hard by the deceit of sin: 3:14 [hgb] 我 们 若 将 起 初 确 实 的 信 心 ， 坚 持 到 底 ， 就 在 基 督 里 有 分 了 。 [kjv] For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end; [bbe] For if we keep the substance of the faith which we had at the start, even till the end, we have a part with Christ; 3:15 [hgb] 经 上 说 ， 你 们 今 日 若 听 他 的 话 ， 就 不 可 硬 着 心 ， 像 惹 他 发 怒 的 日 子 一 样 。 [kjv] While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation. [bbe] As it is said, Today if you will let his voice come to your ears, be not hard of heart, as when you made him angry. 3:16 [hgb] 那 时 听 见 他 话 惹 他 发 怒 的 是 谁 呢 ？ 岂 不 是 跟 着 摩 西 从 埃 及 出 来 的 众 人 吗 ？ [kjv] For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses. [bbe] Who made him angry when his voice came to them? was it not all those who came out of Egypt with Moses? 3:17 [hgb] 神 四 十 年 之 久 ， 又 厌 烦 谁 呢 ？ 岂 不 是 那 些 犯 罪 尸 首 倒 在 旷 野 的 人 吗 ？ [kjv] But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness? [bbe] And with whom was he angry for forty years? was it not with those who did evil, who came to their deaths in the waste land? 3:18 [hgb] 又 向 谁 起 誓 ， 不 容 他 们 进 入 他 的 安 息 呢 ？ 岂 不 是 向 那 些 不 信 从 的 人 吗 ？ [kjv] And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not? [bbe] And to whom did he make an oath that they might not come into his rest? was it not to those who went against his orders? 3:19 [hgb] 这 样 看 来 ， 他 们 不 能 进 入 安 息 ， 是 因 为 不 信 的 缘 故 了 。 [kjv] So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief. [bbe] So we see that they were not able to go in because they had no belief.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/183/2333.html","bookId":65,"book":{"id":65,"title":"希伯来书 Hebrews","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 神 既 在 古 时 借 着 众 先 知 ， 多 次 多 方 的 晓 谕 列 祖 ， [kjv] God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, \u0026n...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/183","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:28 AM"}}
