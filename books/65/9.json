{"id":1883,"no":9,"title":"Chapter 9","content":"9:1 [hgb] 原 来 前 约 有 礼 拜 的 条 例 ， 和 属 世 界 的 圣 幕 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary. \\n\\n [bbe] Now the first agreement had its rules of worship, and a holy order. \\n\\n 9:2 [hgb] 因 为 有 预 备 的 帐 幕 ， 头 一 层 叫 作 圣 所 。 里 面 有 灯 台 ， 桌 子 ， 和 陈 设 饼 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called the sanctuary. \\n\\n [bbe] For the first Tent was made ready, having in it the vessels for the lights and the table and the ordering of the bread; and this is named the holy place. \\n\\n 9:3 [hgb] 第 二 幔 子 后 ， 又 有 一 层 帐 幕 ， 叫 作 至 圣 所 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all; \\n\\n [bbe] And inside the second veil was the place which is named the Holy of holies; \\n\\n 9:4 [hgb] 有 金 香 炉 ， （ 炉 或 作 坛 ） 有 包 金 的 约 柜 ， 柜 里 有 盛 吗 哪 的 金 罐 ， 和 亚 伦 发 过 芽 的 杖 ， 并 两 块 约 版 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron\u0027s rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant; \\n\\n [bbe] Having a vessel of gold in it for burning perfumes, and the ark of the agreement, which was covered with gold and which had in it a pot made of gold for the manna, and Aaron\u0027s rod which put out buds, and the stones with the writing of the agreement; \\n\\n 9:5 [hgb] 柜 上 面 有 荣 耀 基 路 伯 的 影 罩 着 施 恩 座 。 （ 施 恩 原 文 作 蔽 罪 ） 这 几 件 我 现 在 不 能 一 一 细 说 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of which we cannot now speak particularly. \\n\\n [bbe] And over it were the winged ones of glory with their wings covering the mercy-seat; about which it is not possible now to say anything in detail. \\n\\n 9:6 [hgb] 这 些 物 件 既 如 此 预 备 齐 了 ， 众 祭 司 就 常 进 头 一 层 帐 幕 ， 行 拜 神 的 礼 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God. \\n\\n [bbe] Now while these things were in existence, the priests went into the first Tent at all times, for prayer and the making of offerings. \\n\\n 9:7 [hgb] 至 于 第 二 层 帐 幕 ， 惟 有 大 祭 司 一 年 一 次 独 自 进 去 ， 没 有 不 带 着 血 ， 为 自 己 和 百 姓 的 过 错 献 上 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people: \\n\\n [bbe] But only the high priest went into the second, once a year, not without making an offering of blood for himself and for the errors of the people: \\n\\n 9:8 [hgb] 圣 灵 用 此 指 明 ， 头 一 层 帐 幕 仍 存 的 时 候 ， 进 入 至 圣 所 的 路 还 未 显 明 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing: \\n\\n [bbe] The Holy Spirit witnessing by this that the way into the holy place had not at that time been made open, while the first Tent was still in being; \\n\\n 9:9 [hgb] 那 头 一 层 帐 幕 作 现 今 的 一 个 表 样 ， 所 献 的 礼 物 和 祭 物 ， 就 着 良 心 说 ， 都 不 能 叫 礼 拜 的 人 得 以 完 全 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience; \\n\\n [bbe] And this is an image of the present time; when the offerings which are given are not able to make the heart of the worshipper completely clean, \\n\\n 9:10 [hgb] 这 些 事 连 那 饮 食 和 诸 般 洗 濯 的 规 矩 ， 都 不 过 是 属 肉 体 的 条 例 ， 命 定 到 振 兴 的 时 候 为 止 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation. \\n\\n [bbe] Because they are only rules of the flesh, of meats and drinks and washings, which have their place till the time comes when things will be put right. \\n\\n 9:11 [hgb] 但 现 在 基 督 已 经 来 到 ， 作 了 将 来 美 事 的 大 祭 司 ， 经 过 那 更 大 更 全 备 的 帐 幕 ， 不 是 人 手 所 造 也 不 是 属 乎 这 世 界 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building; \\n\\n [bbe] But now Christ has come as the high priest of the good things of the future, through this greater and better Tent, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this world, \\n\\n 9:12 [hgb] 并 且 不 用 山 羊 和 牛 犊 的 血 ， 乃 用 自 己 的 血 ， 只 一 次 进 入 圣 所 ， 成 了 永 远 赎 罪 的 事 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us. \\n\\n [bbe] And has gone once and for ever into the holy place, having got eternal salvation, not through the blood of goats and young oxen, but through his blood. \\n\\n 9:13 [hgb] 若 山 羊 和 公 牛 的 血 ， 并 母 牛 犊 的 灰 洒 在 不 洁 的 人 身 上 ， 尚 且 叫 人 成 圣 ， 身 体 洁 净 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh: \\n\\n [bbe] For if the blood of goats and oxen, and the dust from the burning of a young cow, being put on the unclean, make the flesh clean: \\n\\n 9:14 [hgb] 何 况 基 督 借 着 永 远 的 灵 ， 将 自 己 无 瑕 无 疵 献 给 神 ， 他 的 血 岂 不 更 能 洗 净 你 们 的 心 。 （ 原 文 作 良 心 ） 除 去 你 们 的 死 行 ， 使 你 们 事 奉 那 永 生 神 吗 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God? \\n\\n [bbe] How much more will the blood of Christ, who, being without sin, made an offering of himself to God through the Holy Spirit, make your hearts clean from dead works to be servants of the living God? \\n\\n 9:15 [hgb] 为 此 他 作 了 新 约 的 中 保 。 既 然 受 死 赎 了 人 在 前 约 之 时 所 犯 的 罪 过 ， 便 叫 蒙 召 之 人 得 着 所 应 许 永 远 的 产 业 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance. \\n\\n [bbe] And for this cause it is through him that a new agreement has come into being, so that after the errors under the first agreement had been taken away by his death, the word of God might have effect for those who were marked out for an eternal heritage. \\n\\n 9:16 [hgb] 凡 有 遗 命 ， 必 须 等 到 留 遗 命 的 人 死 了 。 （ 遗 命 原 文 与 约 字 同 ） \\n\\n [kjv] For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator. \\n\\n [bbe] Because where there is a testament, there has to be the death of the man who made it. \\n\\n 9:17 [hgb] 因 为 人 死 了 ， 遗 命 才 有 效 力 ， 若 留 遗 命 的 尚 在 ， 那 遗 命 还 有 用 处 吗 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth. \\n\\n [bbe] For a testament has effect after death; for what power has it while the man who made it is living? \\n\\n 9:18 [hgb] 所 以 前 约 也 不 是 不 用 血 立 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood. \\n\\n [bbe] So that even the first agreement was not made without blood. \\n\\n 9:19 [hgb] 因 为 摩 西 当 日 照 着 律 法 ， 将 各 样 诫 命 传 给 众 百 姓 ， 就 拿 朱 红 色 绒 和 牛 膝 草 ， 把 牛 犊 山 羊 的 血 和 水 ， 洒 在 书 上 ， 又 洒 在 众 百 姓 身 上 ， 说 ， \\n\\n [kjv] For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people, \\n\\n [bbe] For when Moses had given all the rules of the law to the people, he took the blood of goats and young oxen, with water and red wool and hyssop, and put it on the book itself and on all the people, \\n\\n 9:20 [hgb] 这 血 就 是 神 与 你 们 立 约 的 凭 据 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you. \\n\\n [bbe] Saying, This blood is the sign of the agreement which God has made with you. \\n\\n 9:21 [hgb] 他 又 照 样 把 血 洒 在 帐 幕 ， 和 各 样 器 皿 上 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry. \\n\\n [bbe] And the blood was put on the Tent and all the holy vessels in the same way. \\n\\n 9:22 [hgb] 按 着 律 法 ， 凡 物 差 不 多 都 是 用 血 洁 净 的 ， 若 不 流 血 ， 罪 就 不 得 赦 免 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission. \\n\\n [bbe] And by the law almost all things are made clean with blood, and without blood there is no forgiveness. \\n\\n 9:23 [hgb] 照 着 天 上 样 式 作 的 物 件 ， 必 须 用 这 些 祭 物 去 洁 净 。 但 那 天 上 的 本 物 ， 自 然 当 用 更 美 的 祭 物 去 洁 净 。 \\n\\n [kjv] It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. \\n\\n [bbe] For this cause it was necessary to make the copies of the things in heaven clean with these offerings; but the things themselves are made clean with better offerings than these. \\n\\n 9:24 [hgb] 因 为 基 督 并 不 是 进 了 人 手 所 造 的 圣 所 ， （ 这 不 过 是 真 圣 所 的 影 像 ） 乃 是 进 了 天 堂 ， 如 今 为 我 们 显 在 神 面 前 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us: \\n\\n [bbe] For Christ did not go into a holy place which had been made by men\u0027s hands as the copy of the true one; but he went into heaven itself, and now takes his place before the face of God for us. \\n\\n 9:25 [hgb] 也 不 是 多 次 将 自 己 献 上 ， 像 那 大 祭 司 每 年 带 着 牛 羊 的 血 进 入 圣 所 （ 牛 羊 的 血 原 文 作 不 是 自 己 的 血 ） 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others; \\n\\n [bbe] And he did not have to make an offering of himself again and again, as the high priest goes into the holy place every year with blood which is not his; \\n\\n 9:26 [hgb] 如 果 这 样 ， 他 从 创 世 以 来 ， 就 必 多 次 受 苦 了 。 但 如 今 在 这 末 世 显 现 一 次 ， 把 自 己 献 为 祭 ， 好 除 掉 罪 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself. \\n\\n [bbe] For then he would have undergone a number of deaths from the time of the making of the world: but now he has come to us at the end of the old order, to put away sin by the offering of himself. \\n\\n 9:27 [hgb] 按 着 定 命 ， 人 人 都 有 一 死 ， 死 后 且 有 审 判 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: \\n\\n [bbe] And because by God\u0027s law death comes to men once, and after that they are judged; \\n\\n 9:28 [hgb] 象 这 样 ， 基 督 既 然 一 次 被 献 ， 担 当 了 多 人 的 罪 ， 将 来 要 向 那 等 候 他 的 人 第 二 次 显 现 ， 并 与 罪 无 关 ， 乃 是 为 拯 救 他 们 。 \\n\\n [kjv] So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation. \\n\\n [bbe] So Christ, having at his first coming taken on himself the sins of men, will be seen a second time, without sin, by those who are waiting for him, for their salvation. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/183/2339.html","bookId":65,"book":{"id":65,"title":"希伯来书 Hebrews","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 神 既 在 古 时 借 着 众 先 知 ， 多 次 多 方 的 晓 谕 列 祖 ， [kjv] God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, \u0026n...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/183","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:28 AM"}}
