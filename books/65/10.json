He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second. \n [bbe] Then he said, See, I have come to do your pleasure. He took away the old order, so that he might put the new order in its place. \n 10:10 [hgb] 我 们 凭 这 旨 意 ， 靠 耶 稣 基 督 只 一 次 献 上 他 的 身 体 ， 就 得 以 成 圣 。 \n [kjv] By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. \n [bbe] By that pleasure we have been made holy, by the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once and for ever. \n 10:11 [hgb] 凡 祭 司 天 天 站 着 事 奉 神 ， 屡 次 献 上 一 样 的 祭 物 。 这 祭 物 永 不 能 除 罪 。 \n [kjv] And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins: \n [bbe] And every priest takes his place at the altar day by day, doing what is necessary, and making again and again the same offerings which are never able to take away sins. \n 10:12 [hgb] 但 基 督 献 了 一 次 永 远 的 赎 罪 祭 ， 就 在 神 的 右 边 坐 下 了 。 \n [kjv] But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God; \n [bbe] But when Jesus had made one offering for sins for ever, he took his place at the right hand of God; \n 10:13 [hgb] 从 此 等 候 他 仇 敌 成 了 他 的 脚 凳 。 \n [kjv] From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool. \n [bbe] And has been waiting there from that time, till all who are against him are made a foot-rest for his feet. \n 10:14 [hgb] 因 为 他 一 次 献 祭 ， 便 叫 那 得 以 成 圣 的 人 永 远 完 全 。 \n [kjv] For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified. \n [bbe] Because by one offering he has made complete for ever those who are made holy. \n 10:15 [hgb] 圣 灵 也 对 我 们 作 见 证 。 因 为 他 既 已 说 过 ， \n [kjv] Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before, \n [bbe] And the Holy Spirit is a witness for us: for after he had said, \n 10:16 [hgb] 主 说 ， 那 些 日 子 以 后 ， 我 与 他 们 所 立 的 约 乃 是 这 样 。 我 要 将 我 的 律 法 写 在 他 们 心 上 ， 又 要 放 在 他 们 的 里 面 。 \n [kjv] This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them; \n [bbe] This is the agreement which I will make with them after those days, says the Lord; I will put my laws in their hearts, writing them in their minds; he said, \n 10:17 [hgb] 以 后 就 说 ， 我 不 再 记 念 他 们 的 罪 愆 ， 和 他 们 的 过 犯 。 \n [kjv] And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more. \n [bbe] And I will keep no more memory of their sins and of their evil-doings. \n 10:18 [hgb] 这 些 罪 过 既 已 赦 免 ， 就 不 用 再 为 罪 献 祭 了 。 \n [kjv] Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin. \n [bbe] Now where there is forgiveness of these, there is no more offering for sin. \n 10:19 [hgb] 弟 兄 们 ， 我 们 既 因 耶 稣 的 血 ， 得 以 坦 然 进 入 至 圣 所 ， \n [kjv] Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, \n [bbe] So then, my brothers, being able to go into the holy place without fear, because of the blood of Jesus, \n 10:20 [hgb] 是 借 着 他 给 我 们 开 了 一 条 又 新 又 活 的 路 从 幔 子 经 过 ， 这 幔 子 就 是 他 的 身 体 。 \n [kjv] By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh; \n [bbe] By the new and living way which he made open for us through the veil, that is to say, his flesh; \n 10:21 [hgb] 又 有 一 位 大 祭 司 治 理 神 的 家 。 \n [kjv] And having an high priest over the house of God; \n [bbe] And having a great priest over the house of God, \n 10:22 [hgb] 并 我 们 心 中 天 良 的 亏 欠 已 经 洒 去 ， 身 体 用 清 水 洗 净 了 ， 就 当 存 着 诚 心 ， 和 充 足 的 信 心 ， 来 到 神 面 前 。 \n [kjv] Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water. \n [bbe] Let us go in with true hearts, in certain faith, having our hearts made free from the sense of sin and our bodies washed with clean water: \n 10:23 [hgb] 也 要 坚 守 我 们 所 承 认 的 指 望 ， 不 至 摇 动 。 因 为 那 应 许 我 们 的 是 信 实 的 。 \n [kjv] Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;) \n [bbe] Let us keep the witness of our hope strong and unshaking, for he is true who has given his word: \n 10:24 [hgb] 又 要 彼 此 相 顾 ， 激 发 爱 心 ， 勉 励 行 善 。 \n [kjv] And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works: \n [bbe] And let us be moving one another at all times to love and good works; \n 10:25 [hgb] 你 们 不 可 停 止 聚 会 ， 好 像 那 些 停 止 惯 了 的 人 ， 倒 要 彼 此 劝 勉 。 既 知 道 （ 原 文 作 看 见 ） 那 日 子 临 近 ， 就 更 当 如 此 。 \n [kjv] Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching. \n [bbe] Not giving up our meetings, as is the way of some, but keeping one another strong in faith; and all the more because you see the day coming near. \n 10:26 [hgb] 因 为 我 们 得 知 真 道 以 后 ， 若 故 意 犯 罪 ， 赎 罪 的 祭 就 再 没 有 了 。 \n [kjv] For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, \n [bbe] For if we do evil on purpose after we have had the knowledge of what is true, there is no more offering for sins, \n 10:27 [hgb] 惟 有 战 惧 等 候 审 判 和 那 烧 灭 众 敌 人 的 烈 火 。 \n [kjv] But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries. \n [bbe] But only a great fear of being judged, and of the fire of wrath which will be the destruction of the haters of God. \n 10:28 [hgb] 人 干 犯 摩 西 的 律 法 ， 凭 两 三 个 见 证 人 ， 尚 且 不 得 怜 恤 而 死 。 \n [kjv] He that despised Moses\u0027 law died without mercy under two or three witnesses: \n [bbe] A man who has gone against the law of Moses is put to death without pity on the word of two or three witnesses: \n 10:29 [hgb] 何 况 人 践 踏 神 的 儿 子 ， 将 那 使 他 成 圣 之 约 的 血 当 作 平 常 ， 又 亵 慢 施 恩 的 圣 灵 ， 你 们 想 ， 他 要 受 的 刑 罚 该 怎 样 加 重 呢 。 \n [kjv] Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace? \n [bbe] But will not the man by whom the Son of God has been crushed under foot, and the blood of the agreement with which he was washed clean has been taken as an unholy thing, and who has had no respect for the Spirit of grace, be judged bad enough for a very much worse punishment? \n 10:30 [hgb] 因 为 我 们 知 道 谁 说 ， 伸 冤 在 我 ， 我 必 报 应 。 又 说 ， 主 要 审 判 他 的 百 姓 。 \n [kjv] For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people. \n [bbe] For we have had experience of him who says, Punishment is mine, I will give reward. And again, The Lord will be judge of his people. \n 10:31 [hgb] 落 在 永 生 神 的 手 里 真 是 可 怕 的 。 \n [kjv] It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. \n [bbe] We may well go in fear of falling into the hands of the living God. \n 10:32 [hgb] 你 们 要 追 念 往 日 ， 蒙 了 光 照 以 后 ， 所 忍 受 大 争 战 的 各 样 苦 难 。 \n [kjv] But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions; \n [bbe] But give thought to the days after you had seen the light, when you went through a great war of troubles; \n 10:33 [hgb] 一 面 被 毁 谤 ， 遭 患 难 ， 成 了 戏 景 ， 叫 众 人 观 看 。 一 面 陪 伴 那 些 受 这 样 苦 难 的 人 。 \n [kjv] Partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used. \n [bbe] In part, in being attacked by angry words and cruel acts, before the eyes of everyone, and in part, in being united with those who were attacked in this way. \n 10:34 [hgb] 因 为 你 们 体 恤 了 那 些 被 捆 锁 的 人 ， 并 且 你 们 的 家 业 被 人 抢 去 ， 也 甘 心 忍 受 ， 知 道 自 己 有 更 美 长 存 的 家 业 。 \n [kjv] For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance. \n [bbe] For you had pity on those who were in prison, and had joy in the loss of your property, in the knowledge that you still had a better property and one which you would keep for ever. \n 10:35 [hgb] 所 以 你 们 不 可 丢 弃 勇 敢 的 心 ， 存 这 样 的 心 必 得 大 赏 赐 。 \n [kjv] Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward. \n [bbe] So do not give up your hope which will be greatly rewarded. \n 10:36 [hgb] 你 们 必 须 忍 耐 ， 使 你 们 行 完 了 神 的 旨 意 ， 就 可 以 得 着 所 应 许 的 。 \n [kjv] For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise. \n [bbe] For, having done what was right in God\u0027s eyes, you have need of waiting before his word has effect for you. \n 10:37 [hgb] 因 为 还 有 一 点 点 时 候 ， 那 要 来 的 就 来 ， 并 不 迟 延 。 \n [kjv] For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry. \n [bbe] In a very little time he who is coming will come; he will not be slow. \n 10:38 [hgb] 只 是 义 人 必 因 信 得 生 。 （ 义 人 有 古 卷 作 我 的 义 人 ） 他 若 退 后 ， 我 心 里 就 不 喜 欢 他 。 \n [kjv] Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him. \n [bbe] But the upright man will be living by his faith; and if he goes back, my soul will have no pleasure in him. \n 10:39 [hgb] 我 们 却 不 是 退 后 入 沉 沦 的 那 等 人 ， 乃 是 有 信 心 以 致 灵 魂 得 救 的 人 。 \n [kjv] But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul. \n [bbe] But we are not of those who go back to destruction; but of those who have faith even to the salvation of the soul. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/183/2340.html","bookId":65,"book":{"id":65,"title":"希伯来书 Hebrews","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 神 既 在 古 时 借 着 众 先 知 ， 多 次 多 方 的 晓 谕 列 祖 ， [kjv] God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, \u0026n...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/183","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:28 AM"}}
