{"id":1879,"no":5,"title":"Chapter 5","content":"5:1 [hgb] 凡 从 人 间 挑 选 的 大 祭 司 ， 是 奉 派 替 人 办 理 属 神 的 事 ， 为 要 献 上 礼 物 ， 和 赎 罪 祭 。 （ 或 作 要 为 罪 献 上 礼 物 和 祭 物 ） \n [kjv] For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins: \n [bbe] Every high priest who is taken from among men is given his position to take care of the interests of men in those things which have to do with God, so that he may make offerings for sins. \n 5:2 [hgb] 他 能 体 谅 那 愚 蒙 的 ， 和 失 迷 的 人 ， 因 为 他 自 己 也 是 被 软 弱 所 困 。 \n [kjv] Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity. \n [bbe] He is able to have feeling for those who have no knowledge and for those who are wandering from the true way, because he himself is feeble; \n 5:3 [hgb] 故 此 他 理 当 为 百 姓 和 自 己 献 祭 赎 罪 。 \n [kjv] And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins. \n [bbe] And being feeble, he has to make sin-offerings for himself as well as for the people. \n 5:4 [hgb] 这 大 祭 司 的 尊 荣 ， 没 有 人 自 取 ， 惟 要 蒙 神 所 召 ， 像 亚 伦 一 样 。 \n [kjv] And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron. \n [bbe] And no man who is not given authority by God, as Aaron was, takes this honour for himself. \n 5:5 [hgb] 如 此 ， 基 督 也 不 是 自 取 荣 耀 作 大 祭 司 ， 乃 是 在 乎 向 他 说 ， 你 是 我 的 儿 子 ， 我 今 日 生 你 。 的 那 一 位 。 \n [kjv] So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee. \n [bbe] In the same way Christ did not take for himself the glory of being made a high priest, but was given it by him who said, You are my Son, this day I have given you being: \n 5:6 [hgb] 就 如 经 上 又 有 一 处 说 ， 你 是 照 着 麦 基 洗 德 的 等 次 永 远 为 祭 司 。 \n [kjv] As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec. \n [bbe] As he says in another place, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek. \n 5:7 [hgb] 基 督 在 肉 体 的 时 候 ， 既 大 声 哀 哭 ， 流 泪 祷 告 恳 求 那 能 救 他 免 死 的 主 ， 就 因 他 的 虔 诚 ， 蒙 了 应 允 。 \n [kjv] Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared; \n [bbe] Who in the days of his flesh, having sent up prayers and requests with strong crying and weeping to him who was able to give him salvation from death, had his prayer answered because of his fear of God. \n 5:8 [hgb] 他 虽 然 为 儿 子 ， 还 是 因 所 受 的 苦 难 学 了 顺 从 。 \n [kjv] Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered; \n [bbe] And though he was a Son, through the pain which he underwent, the knowledge came to him of what it was to be under God\u0027s orders; \n 5:9 [hgb] 他 既 得 以 完 全 ， 就 为 凡 顺 从 他 的 人 ， 成 了 永 远 得 救 的 根 源 。 \n [kjv] And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him; \n [bbe] And when he had been made complete, he became the giver of eternal salvation to all those who are under his orders; \n 5:10 [hgb] 并 蒙 神 照 着 麦 基 洗 德 的 等 次 称 他 为 大 祭 司 。 \n [kjv] Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec. \n [bbe] Being named by God a high priest of the order of Melchizedek. \n 5:11 [hgb] 论 到 麦 基 洗 德 ， 我 们 有 好 些 话 ， 并 且 难 以 解 明 ， 因 为 你 们 听 不 进 去 。 \n [kjv] Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing ye are dull of hearing. \n [bbe] Of whom we have much to say which it is hard to make clear, because you are slow of hearing. \n 5:12 [hgb] 看 你 们 学 习 的 工 夫 ， 本 该 作 师 傅 ， 谁 知 还 得 有 人 将 神 圣 言 小 学 的 开 端 ， 另 教 导 你 们 。 并 且 成 了 那 必 须 吃 奶 ， 不 能 吃 干 粮 的 人 。 \n [kjv] For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat. \n [bbe] And though by this time it would be right for you to be teachers, you still have need of someone to give you teaching about the first simple rules of God\u0027s revelation; you have become like babies who have need of milk, and not of solid food. \n 5:13 [hgb] 凡 只 能 吃 奶 的 ， 都 不 熟 练 仁 义 的 道 理 。 因 为 他 是 婴 孩 。 \n [kjv] For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe. \n [bbe] For everyone who takes milk is without experience of the word of righteousness: he is a child. \n 5:14 [hgb] 惟 独 长 大 成 人 的 ， 才 能 吃 干 粮 ， 他 们 的 心 窍 ， 习 练 得 通 达 ， 就 能 分 辨 好 歹 了 。 \n [kjv] But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil. \n [bbe] But solid food is for men of full growth, even for those whose senses are trained by use to see what is good and what is evil. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/183/2335.html","bookId":65,"book":{"id":65,"title":"希伯来书 Hebrews","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 神 既 在 古 时 借 着 众 先 知 ， 多 次 多 方 的 晓 谕 列 祖 ， [kjv] God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, \u0026n...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/183","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:28 AM"}}
