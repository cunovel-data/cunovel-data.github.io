{"id":1878,"no":4,"title":"Chapter 4","content":"4:1 [hgb] 我 们 既 蒙 留 下 有 进 入 他 安 息 的 应 许 ， 就 当 畏 惧 ， 免 得 我 们 中 间 ， （ 我 们 原 文 作 你 们 ） 或 有 人 似 乎 是 赶 不 上 了 。 [kjv] Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it. [bbe] Let us then, though we still have God\u0027s word that we may come into his rest, go in fear that some of you may be unable to do so. 4:2 [hgb] 因 为 有 福 音 传 给 我 们 ， 像 传 给 他 们 一 样 。 只 是 所 听 见 的 道 与 他 们 无 益 ， 因 为 他 们 没 有 信 心 与 所 听 见 的 道 调 和 。 [kjv] For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it. [bbe] And, truly, the good news came to us, even as it did to them; but the hearing of the word did them no good, because they were not united in faith with the true hearers. 4:3 [hgb] 但 我 们 已 经 相 信 的 人 ， 得 以 进 入 那 安 息 ， 正 如 神 所 说 ， 我 在 怒 中 起 誓 说 ， 他 们 断 不 可 进 入 我 的 安 息 。 其 实 造 物 之 工 ， 从 创 世 以 来 已 经 成 全 了 。 [kjv] For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world. [bbe] For those of us who have belief come into his rest; even as he has said, As I said in my oath when I was angry, They may not come into my rest: though the works were done from the time of the making of the world. 4:4 [hgb] 论 到 第 七 日 ， 有 一 处 说 ， 到 第 七 日 神 就 歇 了 他 一 切 的 工 。 [kjv] For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works. [bbe] For in one place he has said of the seventh day, And God had rest from all his works on the seventh day; 4:5 [hgb] 又 有 一 处 说 ， 他 们 断 不 可 进 入 我 的 安 息 。 [kjv] And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest. [bbe] And in the same place he says again, They will not come into my rest. 4:6 [hgb] 既 有 必 进 安 息 的 人 ， 那 先 前 听 见 福 音 的 ， 因 为 不 信 从 ， 不 得 进 去 。 [kjv] Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief: [bbe] So that as it is clear that some have to go in, and that the first hearers of the good news were not able to go in because they went against God\u0027s orders, 4:7 [hgb] 所 以 过 了 多 年 ， 就 在 大 卫 的 书 上 ， 又 限 定 一 日 ， 如 以 上 所 引 的 说 ， 你 们 今 日 若 听 他 的 话 ， 就 不 可 硬 着 心 。 [kjv] Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts. [bbe] After a long time, again naming a certain day, he says in David, Today (as he had said before), Today if you will let his voice come to your ears, be not hard of heart, 4:8 [hgb] 若 是 约 书 亚 已 叫 他 们 享 了 安 息 ， 后 来 神 就 不 再 提 别 的 日 子 了 。 [kjv] For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day. [bbe] For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have said anything about another day. 4:9 [hgb] 这 样 看 来 ， 必 另 有 一 安 息 日 的 安 息 ， 为 神 的 子 民 存 留 。 [kjv] There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. [bbe] So that there is still a Sabbath-keeping for the people of God. 4:10 [hgb] 因 为 那 进 入 安 息 的 ， 乃 是 歇 了 自 己 的 工 ， 正 如 神 歇 了 他 的 工 一 样 。 [kjv] For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his. [bbe] For the man who comes into his rest has had rest from his works, as God did from his. 4:11 [hgb] 所 以 我 们 务 必 竭 力 进 入 那 安 息 ， 免 得 有 人 学 那 不 信 从 的 样 子 跌 倒 了 。 [kjv] Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief. [bbe] Because of this, let us have a strong desire to come into that rest, and let no one go after the example of those who went against God\u0027s orders. 4:12 [hgb] 神 的 道 是 活 泼 的 ， 是 有 功 效 的 ， 比 一 切 两 刃 的 剑 更 快 ， 甚 至 魂 与 灵 ， 骨 节 与 骨 髓 ， 都 能 刺 入 剖 开 ， 连 心 中 的 思 念 和 主 意 ， 都 能 辨 明 。 [kjv] For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. [bbe] For the word of God is living and full of power, and is sharper than any two-edged sword, cutting through and making a division even of the soul and the spirit, the bones and the muscles, and quick to see the thoughts and purposes of the heart. 4:13 [hgb] 并 且 被 造 的 ， 没 有 一 样 在 他 面 前 不 显 然 的 。 原 来 万 物 ， 在 那 与 我 们 有 关 系 的 主 眼 前 ， 都 是 赤 露 敞 开 的 。 [kjv] Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do. [bbe] And there is nothing made which is not completely clear to him; there is nothing covered, but all things are open to the eyes of him with whom we have to do. 4:14 [hgb] 我 们 既 然 有 一 位 已 经 升 入 高 天 尊 荣 的 大 祭 司 ， 就 是 神 的 儿 子 耶 稣 ， 便 当 持 定 所 承 认 的 道 。 [kjv] Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession. [bbe] Having then a great high priest, who has made his way through the heavens, even Jesus the Son of God, let us be strong in our faith. 4:15 [hgb] 因 我 们 的 大 祭 司 ， 并 非 不 能 体 恤 我 们 的 软 弱 。 他 也 曾 凡 事 受 过 试 探 ， 与 我 们 一 样 。 只 是 他 没 有 犯 罪 。 [kjv] For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. [bbe] For we have not a high priest who is not able to be touched by the feelings of our feeble flesh; but we have one who has been tested in all points as we ourselves are tested, but without sin. 4:16 [hgb] 所 以 我 们 只 管 坦 然 无 惧 地 ， 来 到 施 恩 的 宝 座 前 ， 为 要 得 怜 恤 ， 蒙 恩 惠 作 随 时 的 帮 助 。 [kjv] Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need. [bbe] Then let us come near to the seat of grace without fear, so that mercy may be given to us, and we may get grace for our help in time of need.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/183/2334.html","bookId":65,"book":{"id":65,"title":"希伯来书 Hebrews","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 神 既 在 古 时 借 着 众 先 知 ， 多 次 多 方 的 晓 谕 列 祖 ， [kjv] God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, \u0026n...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/183","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:28 AM"}}
