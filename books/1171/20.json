{"id":15631,"no":20,"title":"CHAPTER XX","content":"UNDER SUSPICION \\n\\n \\n\\n The kind of music that Abner expected to face when he reached home was wanting. Instead of a severe scolding, tirades, and a regular bombardment of embarrassing questions, he was received in a most gracious manner. The children flocked about him as he unhitched Jerry and put him in the stable. It was somewhat late and dinner was over, but Mrs. Andrews had his place set and everything hot in the oven. She even smiled as he entered the kitchen, a most unusual thing for her. But Abner thought that she watched him somewhat curiously and anxiously as he hung up his coat and hat. He could also feel her eyes upon him as he washed himself and brushed his tangled hair before the little mirror. He wondered what it all meant, though he made no comment, but at once took his seat at the table. After serving him, Mrs. Andrews sat down on the opposite side of the table, another remarkable thing for her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How are the kids gittin\u0027 along?\" Abner at length enquired, more for something to say than anything else. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Very well, I guess,\" was the somewhat absent-minded reply. \"They seem to be having a good time.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Silence then ensued after this effort to start conversation, and Abner went on with his meal. But he was restless, and glanced occasionally out of the window. Once he stopped and listened intently. This Mrs. Andrews noted, and her face became grave. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s only the children,\" she explained. \"The girls are playing with them near the barn.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Say,\" Abner at length remarked, \"has this change-of-heart bizness struck yez all, too?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, what do you mean?\" his wife asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But what has come over yez all, Tildy? This house seems strange. I ginerally got a reg\u0027lar dressin\u0027 down, when I came home late fer dinner. I was so used to it that this peaceful reception is gittin\u0027 on me nerves. I\u0027m like Jerry, an\u0027 can\u0027t stand things when they\u0027re too quiet.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"When did you experience a change of heart, Abner?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Last night when walkin\u0027 home with Zeb. He\u0027s the best hand at that I ever come across. He kin beat Billy Sunday all to bits. He put the punch into me, all right, an\u0027 I guess you must have got a touch of it too, Tildy.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Maybe I have, Abner. But, you see, I\u0027m feeling sorry for you after what you\u0027ve gone through of late.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"An\u0027 ye don\u0027t blame me, Tildy?\" Abner asked in astonishment. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How can I? It wasn\u0027t your fault. I know you couldn\u0027t help it, and that is what worries me. But there, never mind that now. I have something to tell you. Abe Dugan wants to know if you will give him a hand this afternoon with that boat he\u0027s making.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He does, eh? Well, I like his gall. Does he think I\u0027ve got nuthin\u0027 to do?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But it\u0027s a dull day, Abner, and I want you to take back a pattern I borrowed from Mrs. Dugan this morning.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"So that\u0027s where ye were, was it? I thought ye had cleared out entirely.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I merely ran over to get a pattern. I want to make some trousers for the boys, and as we have had no need for such a thing I knew that Mrs. Dugan would let me have hers. She\u0027s going to help me with the work.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She is? Good fer her. I didn\u0027t know that she would stoop to sich things.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, yes, she\u0027s much interested in the boys, and is going to do all she can. But she wants that pattern back this afternoon, and if you won\u0027t take it, then I shall have to do so, though I have so much cooking to do since we have all those extra mouths to feed.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"An\u0027 more grub to buy, eh? An\u0027 where\u0027s the stuff to come from fer them pants, I\u0027d like to know?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am going to use some of your old clothes. I can make them over. The poor little boys are almost in rags.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Abner rose from the table, filled and lighted his pipe. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Where\u0027s that pattern?\" he abruptly asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"So you\u0027re going, are you, Abner?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sure, I am. When ye rub me the way ye have to-day, an\u0027 when Mrs. Abe is goin\u0027 to help with them pants, I can\u0027t very well refuse to give a hand out on that boat. My, we\u0027re all gittin\u0027 mighty holy an\u0027 neighborly all of a sudden. Guess a change of heart must have struck all around. I wonder if it has affected Abe. He could stand a good dose of it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Abner was really glad of an excuse to go to his neighbor\u0027s, as he had not seen him for some time. The building of a boat was of greater interest to him than splitting and piling wood down on the shore. He would find out, too, if Abe had heard anything about his experiences in town; how Joe Preston was getting along, and what people were saying about the affair. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was about three in the afternoon when he reached the Dugan house, and he was informed by Mrs. Dugan that Abe had been called over to Joe Sanders to see his sick horse. Abe considered himself a specialist on animal diseases, and was much in demand. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But you needn\u0027t mind Abe\u0027s absence,\" Mrs. Dugan told him. \"You know more about boats than he does, so you can go right on with the work. The boat is there in the workshop. It is only just started.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Abner noticed that Mrs. Dugan eyed him somewhat curiously, although he paid little attention to it. Perhaps she had heard about his arrest, and wished to see what a man looked like who had been in jail. He was soon lost in the work upon the boat and forgot all about Mrs. Dugan\u0027s close scrutiny. \\n\\n \\n\\n The workshop was adjoining the woodshed, which led off from the kitchen, and for an hour Abner worked away with no one to disturb him. About four o\u0027clock, however, women began to come into the shop. Not all together, but one at a time. First there was Mrs. Bennett, who was anxious, so she said, to see the building of the boat. She asked a number of questions, and interfered with Abner. He treated her most courteously, however, remembering his peaceful ancestors. Then came Mrs. Hopkins. She, too, wished to see the building of the boat, and she had much to say about the time she used to sail on the river with her husband before they were married. Abner breathed a sigh of relief when she left, and wondered how many more women the house contained, and what in the world they were doing there that afternoon. He was not left long alone, however, for in a few minutes Miss Julia Tomkins, a maiden of uncertain age, came out and questioned him about the orphans he had taken into his house. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am so much concerned about those children,\" she informed him, \"that I have lain awake at nights thinking about them. And I know others are, too, and we have met here this afternoon to make up clothes for them.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"An\u0027 so that\u0027s what ye\u0027r doin\u0027, eh?\" Abner asked, as he paused in the act of driving in a nail. \"I was wonderin\u0027 what kind of a hen-party Mrs. Dugan was havin\u0027 this afternoon. How many more are there of yez?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There are about ten in all. It shows what an interest the women are taking in those children.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ten! Good Lord!\" Abner ejaculated. \"It\u0027s no wonder Abe cleared out. Are they all comin\u0027 to see me build this boat?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Does your head hurt you much to-day?\" Miss Tomkins asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Me head! Gee whiz, no! What makes ye think it does?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Because you look so worried.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"An\u0027 wouldn\u0027t anyone look worried with so many visitors? It\u0027s not me head but me hands that hurt. Look at that, now,\" and Abner held out his big rough left hand for inspection. \"I sawed that finger twice when Mrs. Bennett was snookin\u0027 around here, an\u0027 I hit that thumb with the hammer when Mrs. Hopkins was gittin\u0027 on me nerves. If any more of them hens come I don\u0027t know what will happen. I\u0027m feelin\u0027 rather dangerous, an\u0027 might lose me head altogether. So it\u0027s better fer \u0027em to stay away.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You poor man,\" Miss Tomkins sympathized. \"You have been badly treated. I shall see that you are not bothered by any more visitors. But——\" Here she hesitated. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But what?\" Abner queried. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, I was just going to add that if you don\u0027t feel well at any time just call out, will you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Call out! What fer?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"For help, of course. If you feel an attack coming on you at any time, just let me know. I had an uncle who was subject to such spells, and I know more about them than most people. Now, be sure,\" and Miss Tomkins smiled most sweetly. \"So few people understand such cases.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Abner stared at his visitor in amazement, and watched her as she walked away. Was Miss Tomkins going out of her mind? he wondered. He had heard that she often had queer notions, and did strange things. So an uncle of hers had been odd, too, and had spells, so she said. Ah, that accounted for it. It ran in the family. He resumed his work, but he could not forget Miss Tomkins\u0027 peculiar words and looks. Why had she spoken like that to him? and why had Mrs. Bennett and Mrs. Hopkins looked at him so curiously? \\n\\n \\n\\n He had just raised the hammer to drive in a nail when his arm suddenly weakened and the blow fell upon the board instead. An idea had flashed into his mind with startling intensity. Did Miss Tomkins and the rest of the women think that he was off his head? He thought, too, of Tildy\u0027s looks and actions, and in a twinkling the whole thing was as clear as day. She believed that there was something wrong with his head, and she had arranged with Mrs. Dugan to have those women meet him there that afternoon, that they might talk with him and give their opinions. \\n\\n \\n\\n The first feeling that came into Abner\u0027s heart was a strong resentment. He felt like walking right into the house and telling those women what he thought. This soon passed away, however, and a smile illumined his face. He remembered his peaceful ancestors, and what Zeb had told him. He became calm and went on with his work. But his mind was busy and he thought of more than the boat that afternoon. Several times he chuckled, and once he paused and gazed absently out of the dust-laden window. In half an hour he was in a great humor and would even have embraced Ikey Dimock had he happened along just then. He had what he considered a brilliant idea, and he was never satisfied until he had worked it out of his system by definite action. \\n\\n \\n\\n Abner now was losing interest in the boat. He had something else on hand, and he was wondering how he could best put it into practice. \\n\\n \\n\\n He was thinking of this when Mrs. Dugan came into the workshop, and invited him in to have a cup of tea. \"We are all ready,\" she informed him, \"and would like to have you with us. You don\u0027t mind a lot of women, do you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Should say not,\" was the reply, \"I\u0027m used to \u0027em. But I ain\u0027t fitted up fer afternoon tea,\" and he glanced down at his clothes. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, you\u0027re all right, Mr. Andrews. It\u0027s not your clothes we\u0027re anxious to see, but you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I guess ye\u0027r right,\" Abner thought. \"I see through ye\u0027r game. Yez want to see how I\u0027ll act, an\u0027 if I\u0027m really luney? Well, yez\u0027ll have a chance, me hearties.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027ll come, won\u0027t you?\" Mrs. Dugan pleaded. \"The women will be so disappointed if you don\u0027t.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sure, I\u0027ll go,\" and Abner laid down the saw, and followed the woman into the house. \\n\\n \\n\\n They passed through the kitchen and into the dining-room, where the women were all gathered. They were talking in a most animated manner, but suddenly ceased and a dead silence ensued as Abner entered. Several nodded and smiled their welcome, but no one spoke. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got him at last,\" Mrs. Dugan informed them. \"He didn\u0027t want to come, but when I told him how anxious you all were to see him, he just couldn\u0027t refuse, could you, Mr. Andrews?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Should say not,\" Abner gallantly replied, \"\u0027specially when a hull bunch of women wish to look upon me handsome features, an\u0027 when they\u0027ve somethin\u0027 good to eat. Tildy says I allus shine then.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He\u0027s not luney,\" Mrs. Parker whispered to Mrs. Peters, who was sitting next her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He doesn\u0027t seem so,\" was the reply. \"But, my! look what he\u0027s doing!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Dugan had offered Abner a chair, but instead of sitting down he stood upon it, and gazed around smilingly upon the astonished women. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I allus like to stand in the presence of ladies,\" he explained. \"But on an occasion sich as this, it is better fer me to stand as high as possible, so\u0027s yez all kin git a good look at me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My lands!\" Mrs. Hepburn exclaimed, holding up her hands in horror. \"What\u0027s going to happen next?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You can\u0027t eat standing up there, can you?\" Mrs. Dugan asked, as she stood before Abner with tea and cake upon a tray. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sure, why not? It\u0027s good fer the digester. When I was runnin\u0027 the old Flyin\u0027 Scud an\u0027 had an attack of indigestion, I uster climb to the top of the mast an\u0027 stand there an\u0027 eat me meals. This is a cinch to that. No, thank ye, I won\u0027t have no cake or doughnut; I\u0027ll jist have a piece of ye\u0027r dish-cloth instid. I got so used to that last night in jail, where they feed ye on sich things, that somehow I can\u0027t git along without it. Why, it gave me a real change of heart, the same as ye git at a revival meetin\u0027.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n By this time the women were pretty badly frightened. They were now sure that Abner was very much wrong in the head, but no one dared to move or say anything. Even Mrs. Dugan was nonplussed. Abner was now in his element, and he thoroughly enjoyed the diversion he was creating. He drank the cup of tea, and then stepped down softly from the chair. He placed the cup on the table, and looked around the room. A cold chill passed up and down the spine of every woman present. What in the world was the man going to do next? each asked herself. The excitement grew intense when Abner presently fixed his eyes upon Miss Tomkins, who was sitting like a statue, paralyzed with fear, as Abner walked straight toward her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Go away! go away!\" she screamed. \"Don\u0027t come near me!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But Abner made no reply. He began to walk around her, and as he walked, Miss Tomkins began to revolve, chair and all. Three times Abner slowly made the circuit, and three times the damsel revolved, keeping her face to his. Then he paused, and looked at the rest of the women, who were standing huddled together at one end of the room. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t git skeered, ladies,\" he soothed. \"I was jist tryin\u0027 to see what kind of a heart Miss Julia has, or if she has any. But, blame it all, she wriggles so much I can\u0027t find out. I\u0027ve heard it said that she was heartless as fer as young men are consarned, an\u0027 if that\u0027s so, then she needs a change of heart right off, if she ever expects to git married.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027re crazy,\" Miss Julia retorted, forgetting her fear in her anger. \"Get out of this room at once, you brute.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But Abner only smiled. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t git excited, Miss. I\u0027m here now, an\u0027 am in no hurry to go. I\u0027ve got a word to say to these women. They seem to be somewhat uneasy. I guess they\u0027re all gittin\u0027 a change of heart by the look of things.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They\u0027ll have heart failure, if you\u0027re not careful,\" Miss Tomkins warned. She was surprised at herself for her sudden burst of courage. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Heart failure, eh?\" and Abner viewed the women again. \"My, that would be serious. Somethin\u0027 must be done.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He took a step toward them, and raised both hands above his head. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Are yez ready to die?\" he asked, in a deep voice. Screams followed this fearful statement, and several women hurried toward the door. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, ye don\u0027t git out yit,\" Abner declared, as he sprang forward, blocked the way, and stood with his back to the door. \"Yez got me in here, an\u0027 yez think I\u0027m luney. Now, I want to know if yez are all ready to die.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, we\u0027re not!\" Mrs. Dugan replied, \"and I\u0027m surprised at you, Mr. Andrews, for frightening us this way. What in the world do you mean?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Abner gazed at her for a few seconds, and then at the women behind her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, I was thinkin\u0027 if yez are not ready to die, an\u0027 if yez all are in danger of dyin\u0027 of heart failure, yez ought to have a change of heart right off. It might do yez a world of good. I\u0027ve had it already, an\u0027 it makes me feel fine. Ask Tildy, an\u0027 she\u0027ll tell yez.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, it was your wife who told us about you, and your strange actions,\" Mrs. Dugan explained. \"She asked us all to meet you here, talk with you, and try to find out if anything is wrong.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"God bless Tildy!\" was Abner\u0027s unexpected prayer. \"I had no idea that she took sich an interest in me. Guess she\u0027s had a change of heart, all right. Now, set down, ladies, I want to say somethin\u0027. There, that\u0027s more sociable,\" he added, when they were once again seated. \"Now, look here, ladies, I don\u0027t want yez to go away with the notion that I\u0027m luney. I was jist foolin\u0027 yez when I stood on that chair an\u0027 walked around Miss Julia. Yez thought mebbe I was crazy, but I was only havin\u0027 a little fun. Tildy is anxious about me \u0027cause I\u0027ve got into trouble lately, an\u0027 a pretty bad mess it is over that Joe Preston affair. Then, I\u0027ve got five little kids on me hands to clothe and feed. Dear knows, it\u0027s enough to turn any man\u0027s head. But my head\u0027s all right, as fer as the Lord made it right, though Tildy sometimes thinks He got tired before he was through. But that\u0027s neither here nor there. My head\u0027s as it \u0027tis, an\u0027 \u0027tis no \u0027tiser. That\u0027s all, ladies, an\u0027 so I bid yez good afternoon, an\u0027 thank yez kindly fer a very pleasant time. May yez all have a change of heart soon, an\u0027 think of me sometimes as I think of yez allus, yours most lovingly an\u0027 remarkably, Abner Andrews, of Ash Pint.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n With his left hand pressed to his heart, he gave a profound, sweeping bow, and, turning, left the women puzzled and speechless. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1683/49588.html","bookId":1171,"book":{"id":1171,"title":"The Touch of Abner","description":"简介： These words drawled slowly forth produced an immediate effect, and caused fifty people to straighten suddenly up and look enquiringly around.
