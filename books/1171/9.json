{"id":15620,"no":9,"title":"CHAPTER IX","content":"A SLIP OF A GAL When Abner had closed the door behind him, he stood in the middle of the sidewalk and looked at his watch. He had half an hour to spare before the arrival of the train, and that would allow him plenty of time to visit the dump, and give it a thorough inspection. He was mad, and to look again upon the mass of rubbish collected there would afford him considerable satisfaction. It took him but ten minutes to reach the place. Here he stopped and viewed the locality. He longed to have Henry Whittles by his side that he might give expression to the feeling of indignation which was agitating his soul. But not a person could he behold. It was a most unsavoury spot, and the only living creatures there were several crows feasting upon some carrion not far off. \"An\u0027 so this is where they want to build the Home!\" he growled. \"Good Lord! what a place! Why, it\u0027s nuthin\u0027 more\u0027n the Toefat of the Bible, which I\u0027ve heard old Parson Shaw speak about. He said it was the place where them ancient divils sacrificed their children to their god Mulick. But I guess we\u0027ve got jist as big divils now as they had then, an\u0027 mebbe a darn sight bigger. Them old fellers didn\u0027t know any better. It was a part of their religion, so I understand. But these modern cusses want to sacrifice poor little orphan kids in a hole like this, when they know better, an\u0027 have lots of other land where they kin build that Home. An\u0027 they call it \u0027charity.\u0027 Holy Smoke! It makes me mad. I want to hit somebody, an\u0027 I\u0027d like that somebody to be Hen Whittles. An\u0027 him pertendin\u0027 to be a Christian. Bah!\" So intense were Abner\u0027s feelings that he forgot all about the train. He could think only of the meanness of Henry Whittles and those who were in league with him. Not a cent of money would he give, so he vowed, if they persisted in placing the Home in such a vile place. He knew that it could be levelled off, and cleaned up to a certain extent. But that would take much of the money needed for the erection of the building. Then he thought of Lawyer Rackshaw and his contemptible dealings with Widow Denton. He was glad that his nose had been scorched, and that he had tumbled backwards upon the floor. \"Pity he hadn\u0027t broken his neck,\" he muttered. \"This town could well do without sich a thing as that.\" Abner was aroused from his reverie by the screech of the train as it approached a crossing about half a mile from the station. He glanced at his watch in astonishment, and then hurried back through the town. \"I had no idea it was train time,\" he mused. \"But I guess Sam\u0027ll look after the gal all right. Not bein\u0027 there will save me a lot of fussin\u0027. Sam likes that kind of thing, \u0027specially when a pretty gal\u0027s consarned.\" Abner was about one hundred yards from the station when he saw a horse, drawing an express waggon, coming toward him. As it approached, he noticed that a woman held the reins, and that she was bareheaded. In a twinkling the truth flashed upon him, and he paused, uncertain what to do. He knew that it was Belle Rivers driving Jerry at an unusually fast clip. She was using the whip, too, and it was quite evident that Jerry was receiving the surprise of his life. At first Abner was astonished. Then he grew indignant, and sprang into the middle of the street as Jerry drew near. He reached out to grasp the horse by the bridle, but as he did so the fair driver brought the whip stingingly down upon his head. With a roar Abner made for the waggon, but was met with another and yet another well-aimed blow. This excitement, combined with the flourishing of the whip, was more than Jerry could stand. With lowered head, he sped along the street, leaving a huge cloud of dust in his wake. Abner had just time to leap and seize the end of the express as it dashed by, and to pull himself partly aboard. He sprawled across the tailboard, holding on by his elbows, and balancing himself upon his stomach, with his feet beating a tattoo upon the ground. He tried to clutch at something, but the rattle of the waggon, and the steady rain of blows upon his head and shoulders, prevented him from making any progress. And there he hung, speechless and helpless. The people on the main street of Glucom were greatly excited at the strange spectacle they beheld. They could only stand and stare, unable to do anything. But one of the few policemen of which the town boasted happened to be coming along that very moment, and sprang into the middle of the street to intercept what he believed was a runaway horse. The driver saw him and, with considerable difficulty, reined up Jerry by his side. \"Arrest that man,\" she ordered, turning around and pointing to Abner, who had just tumbled off the waggon. \"Arrest her,\" Abner shouted, struggling unsteadily to his feet. \"Why, what\u0027s the meaning of all this, Mr. Andrews?\" the policeman enquired. \"She stole my hoss an\u0027 waggon, an\u0027 beat me black an\u0027 blue; that\u0027s what\u0027s the matter.\" A startled expression suddenly overspread Belle Rivers\u0027 face, and she dropped the reins upon her lap. \"Mr. Andrews!\" It was all she could say, as her eyes swiftly scanned Abner\u0027s unshaven face, rough, dust-covered clothes, and coarse unblackened boots. \"Yes, it\u0027s Abner Andrews, of Ash Pint,\" he chuckled, noting the girl\u0027s embarrassment. \"But I didn\u0027t know, that is, I didn\u0027t expect——\" the girl stammered. \"Oh, no, ye didn\u0027t know him. Expected to find him a reg\u0027lar country gentleman, eh? With tan shoes, pants all creased down in front, big panyma hat, an\u0027 smokin\u0027 a ten-cent cigar.\" The girl\u0027s cheeks were scarlet as she listened to this charge, which she knew was absolutely true. Then the humor of the situation dawned upon her, and a smile wreathed her face. \"Will you forgive me, Mr. Andrews?\" she asked. \"I have been cruelly rude.\" \"But what about me head and shoulders?\" Abner queried. \"Will ye\u0027r sweet apology cure the lumps ye made with that confounded whip?\" \"Perhaps not, but when we get home I shall attend to your bruises with my own hands.\" \"Ye\u0027ll only make \u0027em worse,\" Abner growled. \"Say, Mr. Andrews,\" the policeman interposed, \"I\u0027ve a good mind to arrest you.\" \"Arrest me! Why?\" \"As an idiot.\" \"Idiot!\" Abner was staring hard now at the guardian of the law. \"Yes, as an idiot. You must surely be one, or you\u0027d jump at the chance of having your head and shoulders attended to by the likes of her. I wish it had been me she threshed.\" This view of the situation appealed to Abner, and he squinted an eye at the policeman. \"I see ye\u0027r pint, Tom, an\u0027 it\u0027s a good one. Guess I\u0027d better hustle home, fer I do feel mighty sore.\" Scrambling up over the wheel, he flopped himself down by Belle\u0027s side and picked up the reins. \"Well, s\u0027long, Tom. Much obliged fer ye\u0027r help an\u0027 advice. Will see ye later. Gid-dap, Jerry.\" After they had fairly started on the homeward way, Abner pulled out his pipe and tobacco. \"De ye mind smokin\u0027?\" he asked. \"No, not at all,\" the girl replied. \"I enjoy the smell of tobacco.\" \"That\u0027s good. Me nerves are a bit upsot to-day, an\u0027 terbaccer allus steadies \u0027em.\" \"I am afraid that I am the cause of your trouble, Mr. Andrews. I had no idea that it was you I was whipping, but thought it was a scoundrel wishing to harm me.\" \"Ye didn\u0027t know me, eh? Well, where in the name of all creation was ye goin\u0027 with Jerry?\" \"Merely for a drive. I didn\u0027t want to sit in the waggon with the young men at the station staring at me, so I thought I would drive around for a while until you came back. That was all.\" \"H\u0027m, so that was the way of it, eh? But I do admire ye\u0027r pluck. The way ye walloped me was sartinly wonderful, an\u0027 you only a slip of a gal at that.\" \"I\u0027m used to taking care of myself, Mr. Andrews. In fact, I like an adventure once in a while, for it adds a little spice to life.\" \"Sure, sure, ye\u0027r right, Miss. Guess we must be somethin\u0027 alike as fer\u0027s that\u0027s consarned.\" \"And you are fond of adventure, too; of real exciting experiences?\" the girl eagerly asked. \"Yes; it\u0027s meat an\u0027 drink to me.\" \"But you don\u0027t find much adventure on a quiet farm, do you?\" \"Adventure! Well, I guess ye don\u0027t know Ash Pint yit. Why, my old farm is so light that I have to keep it anchored down fer fear it\u0027ll go up like a balloon.\" \"Oh!\" \"Yep; that\u0027s Gospel truth. G\u0027long, Jerry. Then, there\u0027s a gravel hill on my place which makes the earth top heavy, an\u0027 so the Government is goin\u0027 to take it away.\" \"You don\u0027t say so! Why, Jess never told me anything about such things.\" \"Oh, she\u0027s used to \u0027em. Anyway, she\u0027s so sot on Social Service that she can\u0027t come down to common things. Say, de you swaller all that stuff?\" \"What stuff?\" \"Social Service gas, an\u0027 what it\u0027ll do fer the world, sich as elevatin\u0027 pigs into hogs an\u0027 sich like.\" \"I try to be interested,\" and Belle gave a deep sigh. \"Jess is so wrapped up in her work that I do all I can to help her. But I ani afraid that I\u0027m too light-headed for such things.\" \"Light-headed, be fiddled,\" Abner growled. \"Ye may be light-headed as fer as the color of ye\u0027r hair goes, but no further, skiddy-me-shins if ye are. Ye\u0027r all right, an\u0027 I\u0027m mighty glad ye\u0027r not luney over that Social Service bizness.\" \"You are!\" \"\u0027Deed I am, an\u0027 I wish to goodness that Jess \u0027ud git sich nonsense knocked out of her head.\" \"But it doesn\u0027t hurt her, does it?\" Belle queried. \"I don\u0027t believe anything could change Jess from the sweet, jolly girl that she always is.\" \"Oh, no, Jess is all right that way. But, ye see, she wants to go away to some big city instead of stayin\u0027 at home where there\u0027s a darn sight of elevatin\u0027 to be done. That\u0027s what riles me.\" \"Oh, I see,\" Belle meditatively replied. \"You wish her to remain with you?\" \"That\u0027s jist it, Miss. There\u0027s only me an\u0027 Tildy, an\u0027 it needs someone to brighten up the house a bit. I tell ye our house doesn\u0027t allus have a heavenly atmosphere when we\u0027re alone, not by a jugful. The best wheel an\u0027 axle will git hot an\u0027 make an unholy noise if they run too long together without bein\u0027 greased. I guess most married folks are that way.\" \"I understand,\" and Belle smiled. \"Jess acts as a go-between to make affairs run smoothly. \"Yep, that\u0027s jist it. She\u0027s the grease, an\u0027 she sartinly works wonders in stoppin\u0027 the creakin\u0027 in our house. That\u0027s why I want her to stay with us.\" \"Have you spoken to Jess about it?\" Belle asked. \"Sure. Had a long talk with her.\" \"And what did she say?\" \"Said there wasn\u0027t enough to do at home; that she needed more sailin\u0027 room. I wish to goodness she\u0027d lower her sail, an\u0027 drop anchor at Ash Pint. It \u0027ud make all the difference in the world to me an\u0027 Tildy.\" \"Then you must see that she does,\" was the emphatic reply. \"Does what? Lower her sail and drop anchor at home?\" \"Yes.\" \"But how kin I do it?\" \"Get something important for her to do along Social Service lines. That will keep her for a while at least.\" \"But what kin she do?\" \"I cannot say now, but perhaps something will turn up. We must try to work out a plan which will prove attractive.\" \"Say, you\u0027ve got a shrewd head on ye\u0027r shoulders, Miss. I guess you\u0027ve hit the bull\u0027s-eye, all right. Yes, we must git an anchor of some kind that\u0027ll hold solid.\" These two were now becoming firm friends, and they talked about various matters. Belle explained about her life at the Seminary, and Abner told about the proposed Orphan Home, and his conversation that morning with Lawyer Rackshaw. He was somewhat surprised with himself for talking in such a free and easy manner. But the girl was so sympathetic and willing to listen, that he found it a great comfort to confide in her. \"Ye won\u0027t say a word about this to Tildy an\u0027 Jess, will ye?\" he asked. \"They don\u0027t seem to understand sich things. But you do, an\u0027 that\u0027s why I\u0027ve said more to you than to anyone else.\" \"I\u0027m good at keeping secrets, Mr. Andrews,\" was the reply, \"and I thank you for your confidence.\" \"It\u0027s them Denton kids I\u0027m worryin\u0027 about,\" Abner explained. \"They should be put into a good home at once. I really don\u0027t know what will become of \u0027em, to say nuthin\u0027 about the widder.\" They were in sight of Ash Point now, and Abner directed Belle\u0027s attention to his house some distance ahead, nestling among the trees. \"It ain\u0027t much of a place,\" he apologized, \"but ye\u0027ll git a hearty welcome, lots of room, an\u0027 plenty of fresh air. It\u0027s a mighty healthy place, if I do say it.\" He paused and a peculiar expression suddenly lightened his face. He straightened himself up with a jerk, and brought the palm of his hand down upon his knee with a whack. \"Anything wrong?\" Belle enquired. \"Nuthin\u0027 but a kink. I have it sometimes an\u0027 it makes me kinder queer.\" \"Where does it affect you?\" \"Ginerally in me head.\" \"That\u0027s serious, isn\u0027t it? What do you do for it?\" \"Jist git out an\u0027 make it hustle.\" \"Make what hustle? The kink?\" \"That\u0027s it, \u0027specially if it\u0027s a dandy.\" \"A dandy!\" \"Yep; a dandy idea. That\u0027s what I\u0027ve got. But here we are at home, an\u0027 there\u0027s Tildy an\u0027 Jess waitin\u0027 at the door.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1683/49577.html","bookId":1171,"book":{"id":1171,"title":"The Touch of Abner","description":"简介： These words drawled slowly forth produced an immediate effect, and caused fifty people to straighten suddenly up and look enquiringly around.
