{"id":15621,"no":10,"title":"CHAPTER X","content":"AN UNEXPECTED JOLT It was a hot afternoon, and Zebedee Burns found the shade of the big maple near his workshop very refreshing. He was sitting with his back against the trunk of the tree, his eyes riveted upon the front page of The Live Wire, which the mailman had just left. So intent was he upon what he was reading that he did not notice a man walking toward him from the road. It was Abner, who, when a few yards away, stopped and stood for a few seconds studying his neighbor. \"Some people kin take life easy,\" Abner presently remarked. \"Comes nat\u0027ral, I guess.\" Zebedee merely glanced at his visitor, and without a word continued his reading. \"What\u0027s the news, Zeb?\" Abner asked, coming close and squatting down upon the grass. \"Must be mighty interestin\u0027 by the way ye keep ye\u0027r eyes glued upon that page.\" Zebedee lowered the paper and looked quizzically at his companion. \"Say, Abner,\" he began, \"what were ye doin\u0027 yesterday?\" \"What was I doin\u0027 yesterday! What de ye mean? Wasn\u0027t I Abner Andrews?\" \"Ye couldn\u0027t have been accordin\u0027 to this mornin\u0027s paper. Ye must have been one o\u0027 them ancients ye\u0027ve told me about so often, an\u0027 a mighty savage one at that.\" \"Hey, what are ye givin\u0027 me? What\u0027s that dirty sheet sayin\u0027 about decent people now?\" \"Isn\u0027t it true?\" \"What true?\" \"That you acted like a fool or a lunatic in town yesterday; waylaid a girl drivin\u0027 along Main street; that she beat you black an\u0027 blue with her whip, an\u0027 then had you arrested?\" Abner was on his feet in an instant, greatly excited. \"Is that what it says?\" he roared. \"Sure, haven\u0027t I jist told ye?\" \"But doesn\u0027t it explain anythin\u0027? Doesn\u0027t it tell who the gal was, an\u0027 why I did what I did?\" \"Here, read it fer ye\u0027rself,\" and Zeb handed him the paper. Slowly and carefully Abner read the article which occupied a prominent position, and was featured in big headlines. The writer had made the most of the incident, and the fact that the girl was the daughter of the Attorney General added all the more to the interest. The story was distorted beyond all semblance of reality and mingled with humor. It ended by saying that the culprit was allowed to go owing to the girl, who interceded on his behalf. Abner\u0027s body trembled from the vehemence of his anger, and when he had finished reading he thrust the paper under Zebedee\u0027s nose. \"De ye believe that?\" he demanded. \"Ain\u0027t it true?\" Zeb asked. \"True! True! Did ye ever see anythin\u0027 true in that rag? It\u0027s a lie, a d—n lie, an\u0027 I\u0027m goin\u0027 to punch the nose of that feller wot wrote it, see if I don\u0027t.\" \"Ye better be careful,\" Zeb warned. \"Ye might have to punch several noses, the editor\u0027s included.\" \"An\u0027 de ye think I can\u0027t do it? I kin wipe up the hull bunch with one hand. I\u0027ll make \u0027em take backwater, an\u0027 apologize right smart. Why can\u0027t they leave decent honest people alone? They\u0027ve got more ink than brains. If they\u0027d spend some of their energy writin\u0027 about Hen Whittles\u0027 vile dump, an\u0027 how he wants to sell the place fer one thousand dollars fer that Orphan Home, it \u0027ud be more sensible.\" \"Are they thinkin\u0027 of puttin\u0027 the Home on that dump?\" Zeb asked in surprise. \"That\u0027s jist it. An\u0027 they want my money to buy the hole, which is a dam sight worse than that old Toefat of the Bible.\" \"Did they ask you fer the money?\" \"Sure. Lawyer Rackshaw is doin\u0027 the bizness, an\u0027 when he asked me yesterday fer the money, I burnt the end of his nose with the cigar I was smokin\u0027. It was too bad to spoil a good cigar on a thing like that.\" \"An\u0027 what did he do?\" \"Nuthin\u0027 \u0027cept tumble backwards on the floor, chair an\u0027 all. He got the jolt of his life that time, all right.\" \"Ye better be careful,\" Zeb advised. \"Lawyer Rackshaw\u0027s not likely to fergit a thing like that, an\u0027 I\u0027ve heard say that he never fergives.\" \"I hope he won\u0027t fergit his burnt nose, an\u0027 I don\u0027t care a blue divil if he doesn\u0027t fergive.\" \"You must like to be in hot water, Abner.\" \"I don\u0027t mind at all, \u0027specially when others are in with me. I\u0027ve got a pretty tough skin, an\u0027 kin stand more\u0027n most people.\" \"Guess ye\u0027r right, Abner,\" Zeb agreed, as he rose to his feet. \"I must git to work now.\" Abner went back to his haying, and worked with feverish energy. He was more irritated than usual over the article which had appeared in The Live Wire, and he vowed that the editor should apologize for the insult. \"Mebbe they\u0027ll find that they can\u0027t take liberties with Abner Andrews,\" he muttered, \"even though he doesn\u0027t wear biled shirts an\u0027 white collars.\" When he had worked for about half an hour he went into the house for a drink of buttermilk. As he came out of the milk-room he heard a knock upon the front door. \"Who in time kin that be, now?\" he growled, as he shuffled through the dining-room and into the hall-way. Glancing through the small window, he saw an auto in front of the house, with a young man at the wheel. The door was locked and when Abner tried to turn the key it stuck. \"Hang the thing,\" he growled. \"What\u0027s the matter with it, anyway?\" After several minutes of desperate efforts, punctured by numerous ejaculations of disgust and anger, the key turned, the lock moved, and Abner pulled the door open with a savage yank. Great was his surprise to see standing before him a smartly dressed woman, smiling in a most pleasant manner. \"Excuse me,\" she began. \"I am sorry to give you so much trouble. But does Mr. Andrews live here?\" \"Naw, he jist sleeps here, an\u0027 lives out of doors.\" \"But it\u0027s your place, isn\u0027t it?\" \"Yes, I s\u0027pose so, when Tildy\u0027s not around.\" \"I have come to see Miss Rivers,\" the woman explained. \"She\u0027s staying with you, is she not?\" \"Yep, she\u0027s here all right, but jist now she\u0027s out pickin\u0027 berries with Tildy an\u0027 Jess. So ye want to see her, eh?\" \"Yes, if it\u0027s not too much trouble.\" \"\u0027Tain\u0027t no trouble fer me, though it might be fer Belle. Come in an\u0027 set down while I toot the horn.\" Throwing open a door to the left, Abner ushered the visitor into the parlor. \"Set right down, an\u0027 make ye\u0027rself at home,\" he told her. The woman smiled to herself as Abner left her. Then she studied the room most critically, from the old-fashioned piano to the fresh flowers in the vase upon the center-table. \"Strange that the Attorney General\u0027s daughter should be visiting here,\" she mused. \"What an ignorant and uncouth man that farmer is. His language was most profane when he was trying to open the door.\" Presently the long-drawn blast of the tin horn sounded upon her ears, and again she smiled, but it was the smile of contempt. \"How primitive,\" she meditated. \"And to think of Miss Rivers picking berries like an ordinary country girl! I wonder if her father knows where she is, and what she is doing. I believe the Andrewses have a daughter. I suppose I must invite her, too.\" In a few minutes Abner returned, sat down upon a chair near the piano, and crossed his legs. \"There, I guess that\u0027ll bring her,\" he remarked. \"Tildy\u0027ll think the house is on fire. She\u0027s most scared to death of fire, Tildy is.\" \"You have a beautiful place here,\" and the woman glanced out of the window on her left as she spoke. \"\u0027Tain\u0027t too bad, considerin\u0027 everythin\u0027.\" \"And the view is magnificent, Mr. Andrews.\" \"So Ikey Dimock told me t\u0027other day.\" \"Was Mr. Dimock here?\" \"Yep. He called to see me when I was hoein\u0027 pertaters.\" \"He did! And what did he want?\" The woman seemed unusually curious, and this Abner noted. \"He wanted to buy my place,\" he explained. \"Buy your place!\" \"Yep. Wanted it as a summer place fer his family, so he said.\" \"Did you come to any agreement?\" \"Should say not. I ain\u0027t anxious to sell, \u0027specially to Ikey Dimock.\" \"Why?\" \"Oh, me an\u0027 him don\u0027t jibe; never did.\" \"You have known him for some time, then?\" \"Should say I have. Why, I knew Ikey Dimock when he was pickin\u0027 pin-feathers off his mother\u0027s chickens when she was gittin\u0027 \u0027em ready fer market.\" At these words the bland expression suddenly left the woman\u0027s face, and she straightened herself up haughtily in her chair. \"Mr. Dimock is of good family, so I understand,\" she challenged. \"\u0027Deed he is,\" was Abner\u0027s unexpected agreement. \"I knew Ikey\u0027s dad well, an\u0027 he was the best man I ever saw at steerin\u0027 clear of a job. Why, when he was with me on my old Flyin\u0027 Scud he spent most of his time plannin\u0027 how to git clear of his work. He surely was great at that.\" \"But he was honest, at any rate, was he not?\" the woman asked, now visibly annoyed. \"Honest? He was the honestest man I ever sot eyes on. Why, he was so honest that he was allus tryin\u0027 to take care of his neighbors\u0027 property. Everythin\u0027 he could git his hands on he would take home. He was so honest that at last his neighbors allus kept their barns an\u0027 stables locked.\" \"Do you mean to tell me that he was a thief?\" the woman demanded. \"You seem to have a very poor opinion of him.\" \"Yaas, almost as poor an opinion as old Judge Watkins, who sentenced him to six months in jail fer stealin\u0027 oats from Bill Armstrong\u0027s barn. Ye kin call that anythin\u0027 ye like, but the Judge called it stealin\u0027, an\u0027 he ginerally knew what he was talkin\u0027 about.\" The woman was evidently much annoyed at this candid portrayal of the elder Dimock. She glanced toward the door as if meditating a speedy departure. Abner noted this, and it amused him. \"I wonder what in time\u0027s keepin\u0027 Tildy,\" he remarked. \"She ginerally comes home like a steam engine, pantin\u0027 an\u0027 puffin\u0027, when I blow the horn at this time of the day. I wish to goodness she\u0027d come, fer I was never any good at entertainin\u0027 company, \u0027specially women.\" \"You have certainly entertained me in a most unexpected, and, I might add, unpleasant, manner,\" the woman retorted. \"I am not fond of having past histories raked up. It isn\u0027t pleasant.\" \"I reckon it ain\u0027t, \u0027specially sich a one as that of the Dimock family.\" \"But surely you should not blame Mr. Isaac Dimock for what his father did. He, at any rate, is above reproach, and you can\u0027t bring any unworthy charge against him.\" \"That\u0027s true,\" Abner assented. \"It \u0027ud be no use bringin\u0027 any charge aginst Ikey so long as he\u0027s hand an\u0027 glove with the Government. It \u0027ud only be workin\u0027 fer nuthin\u0027. Ye couldn\u0027t ketch him, not by a jugful.\" \"Why, what has the Government to do with Mr. Dimock?\" the woman asked in apparent surprise. \"It has a great deal to do with him, an\u0027 almost any fool could tell ye that. The Government has made Ikey Dimock jist what he is, if ye want to know the plain truth.\" \"It has! In what way?\" \"H\u0027m,\" and Abner shifted significantly. \"Hasn\u0027t the Government been feedin\u0027 him with pap fer years now? Supplyin\u0027 him with big contracts fer hardware, an\u0027 givin\u0027 him great rake-offs in all sorts of government work? That\u0027s the way Ikey Dimock made his money, an\u0027 he\u0027s nuthin\u0027 more\u0027n a chip off the old block. They called it stealin\u0027 when his dad took the oats from Bill Armstrong\u0027s barn, but now they call it \u0027high finance,\u0027 or some sich name. But it\u0027s stealin\u0027 jist the same. I could tell ye a few things if I had a mind to.\" The woman, however, could stand no more. She had risen to her feet, her face pale, and her eyes blazing with anger. \"Do you know who I am?\" she witheringly asked. \"Don\u0027t ye know ye\u0027rself? If ye don\u0027t, how de ye expect me to?\" \"I am Mrs. Isaac Dimock, that\u0027s who I am, and I shall tell my husband what you have been saying about him and his father.\" \"That won\u0027t be any news to Ikey; better tell him somethin\u0027 new. He knows that already.\" \"Why, I never had anyone talk to me in such an insolent way before,\" the woman protested. \"I didn\u0027t come here to be insulted.\" \"Is tellin\u0027 the truth insultin\u0027 ye?\" Abner asked, as he, too, rose to his feet. \"If the truth of many things was known it \u0027ud be better fer all consarned. But, there, I hear the women now. I guess ye\u0027ve had enough of me.\" Abner slipped out of the house as speedily as possible, after telling his wife that a visitor was in the parlor. He sat down upon the wood-pile, and meditated over what had just taken place. \"Ho! ho!\" he chuckled. \"Her ladyship got a jolt to-day, all right. She thought I didn\u0027t know her, eh? I knew her the minute I sot eyes on her. She didn\u0027t like what I said about the Dimocks. But I could have told her somethin\u0027, too, about her own family-tree. My, wasn\u0027t she mad! Ho, ho!\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1683/49578.html","bookId":1171,"book":{"id":1171,"title":"The Touch of Abner","description":"简介： These words drawled slowly forth produced an immediate effect, and caused fifty people to straighten suddenly up and look enquiringly around.
