{"id":15632,"no":21,"title":"CHAPTER XXI","content":"HARD OF HEARING \n \n \"Hello, Lost Tribes. What are ye makin\u0027?\" \n \n Zeb looked quickly around, and seeing Abner standing in the doorway, a smile overspread his face. \n \n \"Glad to see ye,\" he replied. \"Feelin\u0027 better, eh?\" \n \n \"I haven\u0027t been sick. What are ye givin\u0027 me, Zeb?\" \n \n \"Ye haven\u0027t, eh? Well, from all accounts, ye\u0027ve been up to queer pranks of late. How did the sewin\u0027-circle come along?\" \n \n \"Oh, I see,\" and Abner sat down upon a box. \"Ye\u0027ve been hearin\u0027 somethin\u0027.\" \n \n Zeb did not reply, but went on quietly with his work. \n \n \"What are ye makin\u0027, Zeb?\" \n \n \"What de ye think I\u0027m makin\u0027? A baby carriage?\" \n \n \"Looks to me like a goose-poke.\" \n \n \"So it is; de ye want one?\" \n \n \"De ye think I do?\" Abner snapped. \n \n \"Well, judgin\u0027 from ye\u0027r actions yesterday, one wouldn\u0027t come fer astray.\" \n \n \"Here, never mind that racket, Zeb. I\u0027ve had enough of it. What\u0027s the news?\" \n \n \"News! Lots of it: Joe Preston in the hospital, his assailant in jail, Lawyer Rackshaw\u0027s been givin\u0027 a rat-party, an\u0027 Abner Andrews has been holdin\u0027 a free entertainment at Mrs. Dugan\u0027s. That\u0027s some news, isn\u0027t it?\" \n \n \"Ah, git out. I know all about that, an\u0027 too much in fact. I want to know how Joe\u0027s gittin\u0027 along. Have ye heard?\" \n \n \"Oh, he\u0027s on the mend, an\u0027 is makin\u0027 ready to git after you.\" \n \n \"He is?\" \n \n \"Sure. He\u0027s had Rackshaw up to see him several times already. They\u0027re a pair, all right, an\u0027 I guess it\u0027s up to you to git busy if ye expect to come off with a whole skin.\" \n \n \"H\u0027m,\" Abner sniffed, \"I don\u0027t care a snap of me finger fer \u0027em.\" \n \n \"But ye will, let me tell ye that,\" and Zeb laid down the stick he was holding in his hand and looked at his neighbor. \"Yell lose ye\u0027r place if ye don\u0027t do somethin\u0027. Ye must git a lawyer, Abner, to defend ye.\" \n \n \"But I can\u0027t afford one, Zeb.\" \n \n \"An\u0027 ye can\u0027t afford to do without one, it seems to me.\" \n \n \"Mebbe so.\" And Abner sighed. \"Guess I\u0027ll have to be me own lawyer as fer as I kin see. I\u0027m pretty glib with the tongue.\" \n \n \"A pretty mess you\u0027d make of it. Why, Rackshaw would wind you up in no time. He\u0027s mighty good on a case, so I\u0027ve been told. An\u0027 he\u0027s tricky, too. Will stop at nuthin\u0027 to gain his point.\" \n \n Just then an auto went by, filled with men. \n \n \"Who kin they be?\" Abner enquired, watching the car as it disappeared amid a cloud of dust. \n \n \"Must be men from the Capital,\" was the reply. \"There\u0027s to be an election soon, an\u0027 the members are gittin\u0027 busy, so I hear.\" \n \n \"An election! Why, I never heard a word about it.\" \n \n \"Oh, you were too busy with other things, Abner, so ye didn\u0027t hear. An\u0027, besides, ye don\u0027t take the Wire, so how kin ye expect to know what\u0027s goin\u0027 on?\" \n \n \"When\u0027s the \u0027lection to take place, Zeb?\" \n \n \"Next month, an\u0027 it\u0027s goin\u0027 to be a hard fight. That railroad business has put the Government in a bad hole.\" \n \n \"So I\u0027ve heard. Graftin\u0027, eh?\" \n \n \"I never knew of anythin\u0027 like it. Why, every one of the whole bunch, from the premier down, has been gittin\u0027 his rake-off.\" \n \n \"I know somethin\u0027 about it, Zeb. All them fellers who were in with the government bunch got big slices, whether they did any work or not. One man got ten thousand dollars fer whistlin\u0027 the right tune, an\u0027 another got over a hundred thousand fer winkin\u0027 with his left eye at the right instant. Oh, I\u0027ve heard lots about it.\" \n \n \"An\u0027 it\u0027s true, Abner. True as the Gospel. An\u0027 them same fellers are comin\u0027 to you an\u0027 me to ask us to re-elect \u0027em.\" \n \n \"We won\u0027t do it, Zeb.\" \n \n The latter turned and looked intently at his visitor. \n \n \"What about that place of yours, Abner?\" \n \n \"Well, what about it?\" \n \n \"Don\u0027t ye know? If ye buck that government bunch ye\u0027ll not stand a ghost of a chance to git anythin\u0027 fer ye\u0027r gravel hill. But they might do somethin\u0027 big if ye side with \u0027em.\" \n \n \"De ye mean to insinuate, Zeb, that they kin buy me?\" \n \n \"Not exactly that, but ye might make a better deal if ye rub \u0027em the right way.\" \n \n \"H\u0027m. I\u0027ll rub \u0027em the right way, Zeb. There\u0027s only one right way to rub them fellers, an\u0027 that\u0027s the way I rubbed Joe Preston the other mornin\u0027.\" \n \n \"An\u0027 git into trouble, Abner.\" \n \n \"Mebbe so. But when wasn\u0027t I in trouble? I\u0027ve been more or less in trouble ever since I was born, an\u0027 I\u0027ll be that way as long as there\u0027s snakes an\u0027 skunks in the country.\" \n \n Abner rose to his feet, pulled out his pipe, and started to fill it. \n \n \"Say, Zeb,\" he presently began, \"I wish ye\u0027d give me a hand this mornin\u0027.\" \n \n \"What is it ye want?\" \n \n \"Help me to fix up me woodshed, will ye? We\u0027ve had a big surprise at our house.\" \n \n \"Should say ye had. Twins one night an\u0027 triplets the next day. Rapid increase, that. How\u0027s the missus?\" \n \n Abner struck a match and paid no attention to this sally. \n \n \"Yes, we\u0027ve had a big surprise,\" he continued. \"A team came from town last night with a hull load of cots, mattresses, boxes of clothin\u0027 an\u0027 dear knows what all.\" \n \n \"Ye don\u0027t tell!\" Zeb was much interested now. \"Where did they come from?\" \n \n \"Guess it\u0027s some of Belle\u0027s doin\u0027s. She\u0027s written to her pa an\u0027 some friends, if I\u0027m not mistaken, tellin\u0027 \u0027em about the kids we\u0027ve taken under our roof, an\u0027 they sent the things. Why, the dooryard is filled chock-a-block.\" \n \n \"Where are ye goin\u0027 to put \u0027em, Abner?\" \n \n \"In the woodshed. It\u0027s got to be fixed up, an\u0027 I want ye to give me a hand this mornin\u0027. Tildy an\u0027 the gals have taken the kids over to the island to pick berries, an\u0027 I want to have it all done when they come back. It\u0027ll be a kind of surprise.\" \n \n \"What are ye goin\u0027 to do?\" \n \n \"Fix the floor an\u0027 walls, an\u0027 partition off a part of the shed. It\u0027ll make a dang fine place, an\u0027 I\u0027ve got the boards. Will ye give me a hand?\" \n \n \"Sure,\" was the ready response. \"I\u0027ll go right along. I ain\u0027t very busy this mornin\u0027. I was only makin\u0027 a goose-poke. That gander of mine is a reg\u0027lar old nick fer crawlin\u0027 through small holes in the fence. But I guess this\u0027ll keep him in, all right.\" \n \n \"It\u0027s a pity ye can\u0027t make pokes fer men as easy as ye kin fer ye\u0027r old gander, Zeb. I\u0027d order two right off, one fer Ikey Dimock an\u0027 t\u0027other fer Lawyer Rackshaw. There should be a law passed makin\u0027 goose-pokes necessary fer some people who are allus botherin\u0027 their neighbors.\" \n \n \"Ye couldn\u0027t git that law passed, Abner.\" \n \n \"Why not?\" \n \n \"\u0027Cause them who make the laws \u0027ud be the first ones to use the pokes. They\u0027d be carryin\u0027 \u0027em around all the time.\" \n \n \"Ho, ho, I guess ye\u0027r right, Zeb. But come on, an\u0027 let\u0027s git at that job.\" \n \n For two hours the men worked upon the woodshed, and at the end of that time they had made excellent progress. The walls and the floor had been repaired, the partition put up, and the place thoroughly swept. \n \n \"There, I guess that\u0027s some work,\" Abner remarked, as he critically surveyed the room. \"Doesn\u0027t take us long to do a job when we once git at it, eh, Zeb?\" \n \n \"Let\u0027s finish it, though,\" was the reply. \"We might as well fix up the cots while we\u0027re about it.\" \n \n \"Sure, an\u0027 have everythin\u0027 ready when the folks git back. My, won\u0027t they be surprised. An\u0027 Orphan Home built in two hours! I wonder what them slow-pokes in town would think of that.\" \n \n They had just begun to carry in the cots, when an auto stopped before the house, and the impatient call of a klaxon sounded forth. \n \n \"It\u0027s the same men who went by when we were in the shop,\" Zeb explained. \"Must be them members after ye\u0027r vote, Abner. They want ye to go out. Listen to the noise that thing\u0027s makin\u0027.\" \n \n \"Jerry\u0027ll like that,\" was the reply. \"He must be shiverin\u0027 with delight. Let \u0027em keep it up.\" \n \n And keep it up they did for a whole minute, while Zeb and Abner went on with their work. \n \n \"Hi there,\" shouted an impatient voice. \"Are you deaf?\" \n \n Abner winked at Zeb. \n \n \"S\u0027pose we let \u0027em think we are deaf,\" he suggested. \"I don\u0027t like their gall. Anyway, we might as well have a little fun, so let\u0027s bring down their topsails. They\u0027re carryin\u0027 too much sail fer sich crafts.\" \n \n \"All right, Abner, I\u0027m game,\" Zeb agreed. \"But be careful.\" \n \n \"Oh, I\u0027ll be as keerful as I was with Joe Preston. You jist go on with the work as if ye didn\u0027t hear nuthin\u0027, an\u0027 let me handle this show. But, say, they\u0027re runnin\u0027 the car into the yard. What impudence!\" \n \n When a short distance away from the back door the auto was stopped, and the man who had previously spoken asked why in the devil no one had answered when spoken to. Zeb was hard at work, thus leaving Abner to face the irritated man. \n \n \"Didn\u0027t you hear what I said?\" the stranger roared. \n \n \"Hey?\" Abner asked, coming close to the car, and putting his left hand up to his ear. \n \n \"Why, the old fool\u0027s deaf!\" the man exclaimed, turning to his companions. \"Good Lord! Have I got to yell everything to him! Look here,\" he shouted, leaning well over the side of the car, \"are you Abner Andrews?\" \n \n \"Oh, huntin\u0027 rabbits, are ye?\" Abner\u0027s face cleared as he spoke. \"Well, ye\u0027ve come to a poor place, an\u0027 it\u0027s the wrong time of the year, anyway. Better wait till winter. They\u0027re good eatin\u0027 then.\" \n \n \"I didn\u0027t say \u0027rabbits,\u0027\" the man again yelled. \"I said \u0027are you Abner Andrews?\u0027\" \n \n \"Don\u0027t mention it. I allus like to give a lift if I kin. But I advise yez to wait till winter,\" Abner solemnly replied. \n \n \"Oh, h—l!\" the man exclaimed in disgust. \"What am I to do? He\u0027s stone deaf.\" \n \n \"Ask him something else,\" one of his companions suggested. \n \n \"Is this your place?\" the man once more roared. \n \n \"Is this my face?\" Abner queried. \"Sure, whose de ye s\u0027pose it is?\" \n \n \"Your place,\" the man roared again. \n \n \"Oh, place. Well, why didn\u0027t ye say so? Sartinly, it\u0027s my place. What de ye want to know fer?\" \n \n \"Will you sell?\" \n \n \"Have I a well? Yes, and a good one, too. De ye want a drink?\" \n \n The other three occupants of the car were highly amused, and made all kinds of remarks. \n \n \"Speak louder, Tom,\" one advised. \"You\u0027re only whispering.\" \n \n \"Speak yourself, then,\" was the retort. \"Don\u0027t you see I\u0027m splitting my lungs shouting to the old fool?\" \n \n \"Get up closer,\" another urged with a laugh. \n \n \"Ugh! I\u0027m as close as I want to be now. He smells like a pig-pen.\" \n \n \"Why not try that other old cuss,\" the third suggested, motioning to Zeb. \"Surely he\u0027s not deaf.\" \n \n Acting on this advice, the spokesman looked at Abner, and pointed to Zeb, who had just come out of the woodshed. But Abner shook his head. \n \n \"He\u0027s deaf as a post,\" was the reply. \"He can\u0027t hear nuthin\u0027. Ye\u0027ll have to talk to me.\" \n \n Tom fetched a big sigh, looked around in despair, and mopped his perspiring brow. \n \n \"What in the world are we to do?\" he panted. \"We must find out if he will sell, and how much he wants. Dimock\u0027s support depends upon our getting this place. I\u0027d let him go to the devil, where he belongs, if election wasn\u0027t so near.\" \n \n \"Write out your questions, Tom,\" came the suggestion. \"That\u0027s the easiest way.\" \n \n \"Why, sure. We might have thought of it sooner.\" \n \n Whipping out his note-book and pencil he scribbled down a few lines, and handed the book to Abner. The latter took it, and studied it for a few seconds. \n \n \"So yez are the Directors of the Big Draw Railway, eh?\" he drawled. \"I thought mebbe yez were government heelers. An\u0027 yez want to buy my place? Well, that\u0027s interestin\u0027.\" \n \n \"Is the gravel good?\" Tom again wrote. \n \n \"Good,\" Abner mused, as he carefully studied the words. \"Well, I never heard anythin\u0027 to the contrary. It was behavin\u0027 itself the last time I saw it. It\u0027s never done any swearin\u0027 or cheatin\u0027 to my knowledge. It minds its own bizness, which is more\u0027n I kin say of most people.\" \n \n These words caused the men in the car to laugh uproariously. Abner seemed surprised at their merriment, and looked enquiringly at the spokesman. \n \n \"Have yez all been drinkin\u0027?\" he asked. \"Better leave it alone, young men. It\u0027s bad fer the health.\" \n \n \"We\u0027ve not been drinking,\" Tom wrote. \"We\u0027re as dry as old Parson Jackson. How much gravel have you and how deep is it?\" \n \n \"Let me see,\" and Abner scratched his head. \"Oh I guess fifty acres, more or less, good gravel. An\u0027 it\u0027s deep, too. Why, it\u0027s as deep as any government grafter ye ever saw, an\u0027 as unsartin. It\u0027s so shifty ye jist never know what it\u0027s goin\u0027 to do next.\" \n \n \"Will you sell?\" was the next question written. \n \n \"Sell? Well, that all depends. I was thinkin\u0027 of keepin\u0027 the place, as I might want it several hundred years from now. But mebbe it \u0027ud be as well to git clear of it when the chance comes. If I\u0027m to have a mansion in the sky, as I\u0027ve heard about, no doubt there\u0027ll be lots of ground around the buildin\u0027, enough anyway, fer my purpose.\" \n \n The men in the auto looked at one another in surprise. \n \n \"Why, I believe the old chap\u0027s batty,\" one remarked. \"He\u0027s talking blooming nonsense. He\u0027ll have a mansion here on earth pretty soon, with keepers, too, if I\u0027m not much mistaken.\" \n \n \"Never mind that,\" Tom replied. \"All we want is his place, and he can go to the Asylum or to the devil for all I care. I\u0027m sick and tired of the old fool.\" He then wrote another question. \n \n \"How much do you want for your place?\" \n \n \"How much?\" and Abner looked lingeringly over toward the big gravel hill. \"Well, I want all I kin git, an\u0027 a darn sight more, if ye don\u0027t mind.\" \n \n \"But how much?\" came the next question. \n \n \"How much? Let me see. Oh, I guess fifteen thousand\u0027ll do, though I hate to sacrifice the place.\" \n \n \"Fifteen thousand!\" the men in the car fairly rose from their seats. \n \n \"Too much,\" Tom wrote. \n \n \"So I imagined,\" Abner drawled. \"Too much fer me to git, but not enough fer the grafters, eh? Ye\u0027r willin\u0027 to pay one man a hundred thousand fer winkin\u0027 at the right minute, an\u0027 another fifty thousand fer holdin\u0027 his tongue. Ye didn\u0027t consider twenty thousand too much to give Ben Slosson fer twelve acres of land, an\u0027 most of it mud an\u0027 rocks at that, did ye?\" \n \n Abner now saw that the men were becoming angry and impatient, and it greatly amused him. All but Tom agreed to leave at once and not waste any more time. \n \n \"I\u0027m going to have another crack at him, though,\" and Tom wrote another question. \n \n \"Ye\u0027ll give me two thousand, will ye?\" Abner queried. \"Well, there\u0027s nuthin\u0027 doin\u0027; then, so yez might as well trot off. It\u0027s fifteen thousand or nuthin\u0027.\" \n \n \"But we can expropriate your place,\" Tom again wrote. \n \n \"What\u0027s that thing?\" Abner asked. \n \n \"The Government can take your place and give you what they like. They have the power.\" \n \n \"They have, eh? Well, let \u0027em try, that\u0027s all. Let the hull dang bunch come. I\u0027m the government here, an\u0027 I intend to be so. I\u0027ve paid fer me place, an\u0027 until I git what it\u0027s worth I intend to keep it. So, good-day to yez all, an\u0027 give my compliments to Ikey Dimock, an\u0027 thanks fer ye\u0027r personal remarks.\" \n \n At these words the four men started, while an expression of consternation appeared upon their faces. \n \n \"Did you hear what we said?\" Tom asked. \n \n \"Sure; how could I help it?\" \n \n \"And you\u0027re not deaf?\" \n \n \"Jist as deaf as he is,\" and Abner motioned to Zeb. \n \n \"You old devil!\" Tom roared, now wild with rage. \"What did you mean by deceiving us?\" \n \n \"An\u0027 what did yez all mean by comin\u0027 here an\u0027 tryin\u0027 to buy me place fer two thousand dollars, that yez might sell it to the Government fer a big sum, an\u0027 divvy up with Ikey Dimock? Tell me that.\" \n \n \"But we didn\u0027t,\" Tom protested. \"We are honest men.\" \n \n \"H\u0027m, honest men,\" Abner snorted. \"I\u0027ve got ears like a deer an\u0027 eyes like a hawk. Ye can\u0027t fool me with any of ye\u0027r tricks. If I am an\u0027 \u0027old cuss\u0027, \u0027fit fer the lunatic asylum,\u0027 an\u0027 \u0027smell like a pig-pen\u0027, I\u0027ve got a few ounces of sense left yit, thank the Lord.\" \n \n The visitors were completely confounded. They were furious, and made no attempt to conceal their anger. They swore and vowed what they would do. But Abner only smiled in a most tantalizing manner, and stood watching as they backed the car out of the yard and sped rapidly away. \n \n \"Well, Zeb, how did she go?\" he asked, turning to his companion, who was standing by his side. \n \n \"Say, Abner, you should be a politician or an actor,\" was the reply. \"You\u0027d make ye\u0027r fortune at either.\" \n \n \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 to make it, Zeb, jist as Abner Andrews, of Ash Pint, an\u0027 nuthin\u0027 else. I guess a man needs to be a politician or an actor no matter who he is, to keep step with them beauties. Ho, ho, weren\u0027t they surprised when I opened up on \u0027em! Thought we was both deaf, ha, ha. Come in, Zeb, an\u0027 let\u0027s have dinner on this. Tildy\u0027s left some things in the house. \u0027Old cuss,\u0027 \u0027batty,\u0027 \u0027smells like a pig-pen.\u0027 Ho, ho, that\u0027s the best yit.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1683/49589.html","bookId":1171,"book":{"id":1171,"title":"The Touch of Abner","description":"简介： These words drawled slowly forth produced an immediate effect, and caused fifty people to straighten suddenly up and look enquiringly around.
