{"id":15617,"no":6,"title":"CHAPTER VI","content":"A FLEA IN THE EAR Abner was unusually silent at dinner and did not seem to notice the neatly set table, nor the fresh wild flowers artistically arranged in the little vase in the centre. He glanced occasionally at his daughter who was sitting opposite, and his eyes shone with pride. He would have been less than human had his heart not thrilled at the vision before him. Jess was in her brightest mood. Her face glowed with abounding health, and her dark eyes beamed with animation as she talked with her mother about her plans for the future, and of the approaching visit of Isabel Rivers. Mrs. Andrews, too, was in excellent spirits, for the finishing touches had been given to the house that morning, and everything was in readiness for the visitor. She nevertheless noted her husband\u0027s preoccupied air, and wondered what was troubling him. When dinner was over Abner pushed back his chair, and gave a deep sigh. \"What\u0027s the matter with you, Abner?\" his wife asked. \"You don\u0027t seem to be yourself to-day. You\u0027re not sick, I hope.\" \"Do I look sick, Tildy?\" \"Well, no, judging by the dinner you ate. But you act like a sick man for all that. Maybe it\u0027s your liver.\" \"No, it ain\u0027t me liver; it\u0027s me heart. That\u0027s what\u0027s the matter.\" \"Your heart!\" Jess exclaimed. \"Why, daddy, I didn\u0027t know you had heart trouble.\" \"Ye didn\u0027t, eh? Well, I had it once, jist about the time I asked ye\u0027r mother to marry me. It was a mighty bad dose.\" \"H\u0027m, you soon got over it,\" Mrs. Andrews retorted. \"I sure did, Tildy. Ye\u0027r right there. It didn\u0027t take long after we got hitched, an\u0027 I thought I\u0027d never have another attack.\" \"What brought it on now, for pity sakes, Abner? It can\u0027t be a woman this time.\" \"It sartinly is.\" \"A woman!\" \"Yes, a woman; a livin\u0027 female woman, an\u0027 a widder at that.\" \"Good gracious, Abner! A widow! What do you mean, anyway?\" \"Jist what I said; a widder, an\u0027 she\u0027s the one who\u0027s given me the heart kink this time.\" At these words a startled look came into Jess\u0027s eyes, and her face grew suddenly pale. But Mrs. Andrews showed no signs of uneasiness. She knew her husband too well to be shocked at anything he might say or do. \"Well,\" she remarked, \"whoever that widow is, she\u0027s welcome to all the heart you\u0027ve got, Abner. If she can find it, then it\u0027s more than I can.\" \"Yes, it\u0027s a widder,\" Abner continued, unheeding his wife\u0027s sarcasm, \"an\u0027 she\u0027s got five kids, an\u0027 they\u0027re worrin\u0027 me a lot.\" \"I should say they would, Abner. You\u0027ll have more than one kink in your heart if you undertake to handle such a brood. When do you expect to take charge of your new family?\" \"Take charge! Did I say anything about takin\u0027 charge?\" and Abner glared at his wife. \"I only said me heart aches fer \u0027em, an\u0027 it sartinly does, fer they\u0027re starvin\u0027.\" \"Starving!\" Jess exclaimed. \"Who are they, anyway?\" \"Widder Denton an\u0027 her brood; that\u0027s who they are. Her little boy died yesterday, an\u0027 Lost Tribes is makin\u0027 a coffin fer him.\" \"Oh, daddy, I hadn\u0027t any idea there was such need so near home, did you?\" \"I sure didn\u0027t. But it\u0027s Gospel truth. Widder\u0027s sick, an\u0027 kids starvin\u0027.\" \"Isn\u0027t it awful!\" and Jess clasped her hands before her. \"Can\u0027t anything be done for them? The children should be looked after at once, and someone should stay with Mrs. Denton.\" \"Oh, I guess the neighbors\u0027ll attend to that fer a while. Zeb\u0027ll find out, no doubt.\" \"Isn\u0027t the Orphan Home ready yet, daddy?\" \"What Orphan Home?\" and Abner looked keenly into his daughter\u0027s face. \"What have ye heard about it?\" \"Nothing much, only I thought they were building one at Glucom. There was some talk about it, wasn\u0027t there?\" \"Talk! Sure there was talk. They\u0027ve been talkin\u0027 about it fer years, but I guess that\u0027s as fer as it\u0027ll go. But there, I must git at them pertaters.\" Abner gave a fleeting glance at his wife, picked up his hat and left the room. \"What is the matter with, daddy?\" Jess asked, after her father had gone. \"In what way?\" Mrs. Andrews enquired. \"I hardly know, except that he seems strange at times. The day I came home he got so excited when I picked up a copy of The Live Wire which had dropped from his pocket.\" \"He did! What did he say?\" \"He shouted at me and made me give it back to him at once. He said it was dangerous, and that if I looked at it there would be a terrible explosion. I told him there must be something in it that he did not want me to see, and he did not deny it. Have you seen it, mother?\" \"No, he didn\u0027t say anything to me about it. I never knew that he brought the paper home. I wonder where he put it.\" Mrs. Andrews believed that she knew the cause of her husband\u0027s excitement over The Live Wire, and what it contained. But she felt annoyed that he had not shown it to her. Was there something in it that he did not wish her to see? she asked herself. The more she thought about it the more determined she became to find out where Abner had hidden the paper. She said nothing, however, to Jess about it, but discreetly changed the subject, and began to talk about Widow Denton and her troubles. While the women thus lingered at the table and talked, Abner was busy in his potato patch back of the barn. The weeds were thick and stubborn, but he seemed to take a special delight in tearing them out of the ground. \"Give me somethin\u0027 to shake me timbers an\u0027 I kin work like the divil,\" he had often said. \"I kin never accomplish as much in hayin\u0027 time as when a thunderstorm is racin\u0027 down the valley. I\u0027m somethin\u0027 like me old Flyin\u0027 Scud. When it was calm she wasn\u0027t worth her salt, but let a gale hit her, an\u0027 my! how she\u0027d gather her skirts an\u0027 run.\" Seldom had Abner such thoughts to agitate his mind as on this fine warm afternoon. He was deeply concerned about the Denton affair, and this naturally turned his attention to the proposed Orphan Home. He was fully aware that this case of destitution would revive a greater interest in the building of the institution, and that he might be called upon at any moment for the thousand dollars he had offered. How he was to raise that amount he had not the slightest idea, and he realized that he had made a fool of himself. If he failed to make good, he would be the laughing-stock of all, and he would be ashamed to be seen again on the streets of Glucom. Added to this worry was the thought of Jess leaving home. He recalled what she had said that morning on the way from the station, as well as her recent conversation at the dinner table. That she was determined to go in a few weeks seemed certain, and Abner groaned inwardly when he thought of the dreariness of the house without her exhilarating presence. \"Hang that Seminary!\" he muttered. \"I wish to goodness Jess had never seen the place. Social Service! Progress! Uplift! Umph! I wouldn\u0027t mind gals studyin\u0027 sich things if they\u0027d use common sense. But to galivant off to elevate people in big cities instead of stayin\u0027 home where they kin be of some real use, is what makes me hot.\" Abner had paused in his work and was leaning upon his hoe. He was gazing thoughtfully out over the field, toward the main highway. And, as he looked, a car containing one man came suddenly into sight, and drew up by the side of the road. Then a man alighted and walked briskly across the field. \"It\u0027s Ikey Dimock, skiddy-me-shins, if it ain\u0027t!\" Abner exclaimed. \"What in the world kin the critter want of me! I don\u0027t want to see him, nor anyone of his brood.\" Isaac Dimock was a little man, but what he lacked in size he tried to make up in pompousness. \"It seems to me,\" Abner once said, \"that the Lord got somehow mixed up when he was makin\u0027 Ikey Dimock. It is sartin\u0027 sure, judgin\u0027 from Ikey\u0027s ears and brains, that he intended him to be a jackass. But He must have changed his mind, an\u0027 finished him up as a man, but a mighty poor job He made of it. It\u0027s quite clear that Ikey stopped growin\u0027 too soon. The only pity is that he ever grew at all.\" Between these two men there had never been any love lost. Abner despised Isaac for his meanness, underhandedness, and pompousness, while Isaac hated Abner for his sharp tongue and biting sarcasm. They seldom met without a wordy battle of one kind or another. They never came to blows, as the hardware merchant had considerable respect for the farmer\u0027s great strength and big fists, one of which, on a certain memorable occasion, had been doubled up dangerously near his stub of a nose. But Isaac seemed to have forgotten and forgiven all animosities as he now drew near. His face was contorted with a smile, such as a wolf might assume when about to pounce upon a lamb. \"How are you, Abner?\" he accosted. \"Fine day this.\" \"Why, so it is,\" and Abner gazed around in apparent astonishment, \"I hadn\u0027t thought about it before. It\u0027s good of ye to come an\u0027 tell me.\" \"You work too hard,\" the visitor replied, unheeding the sarcasm. \"You don\u0027t take time to notice the beautiful things around you.\" \"H\u0027m,\" Abner grunted. \"It takes all my spare minutes tryin\u0027 to wring a livin\u0027 out of this darn place. Have to keep me nose to the ground most of the time.\" \"I should say so,\" and Isaac cast his eyes around until they rested upon the big gravel hill to his right. \"Pretty light ground, eh?\" \"Light! Should say it is. Why, it\u0027s so light I have to keep the place anchored or it \u0027ud go up like a balloon.\" \"Ha, ha, it certainly must be light. Rather dangerous, isn\u0027t it?\" \"Oh, I\u0027m not the least bit afraid of what old Mother Nature does. She\u0027s pretty reliable, an\u0027 doesn\u0027t do any kinky tricks. Ye kin ginerally depend upon her. But it\u0027s human nature on two legs that I\u0027m suspicious of.\" Isaac cast a swift glance at the farmer in an effort to interpret the meaning of his words. But Abner\u0027s face was perfectly placid as he leaned upon his hoe and surveyed his garden. \"Why are you suspicious of human nature?\" Isaac enquired. \"\u0027Cause it\u0027s allus tryin\u0027 to undermine one, that\u0027s why. Now look here, I work this place, plant seeds, fight frost, bugs, cutworms, crows, an\u0027 dear knows what all. Then I take me produce to town, an\u0027 give it away. Yes, actually give it away, fer I don\u0027t make enough profit to keep a shirt on a flea. But when them storekeepers sell the stuff which caused me so much work an\u0027 anxiety they make big profits. They call it bizness; but I call it robbery. Is it any wonder that I\u0027m suspicious of human nature on two legs?\" \"It certainly is discouraging,\" Isaac blandly purred. He was thinking of his own big profits in hardware. \"It is a wonder you don\u0027t give up farming,\" he continued. \"Why not try something else?\" \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 to give it up,\" Abner declared. \"You are! Well, it\u0027s fortunate that I came to see you to-day.\" \"Why?\" \"Because I want to buy your place.\" \"Buy my place!\" Abner exclaimed. \"What de ya want this place fer, I\u0027d like to know?\" \"For the situation. I need a place where I can bring my family during the summer, and this farm will suit us fine. The view is excellent, and there is a good beach for boating and bathing. How much do you want for it?\" \"I didn\u0027t say I was goin\u0027 to sell, did I?\" Abner roared. \"But you just told me you are going to give up farming, didn\u0027t you?\" \"Sure, I did. But that doesn\u0027t mean I want to sell. I\u0027m goin\u0027 to give up farmin\u0027 some day, an\u0027 you\u0027re goin\u0027 to give up the hardware bizness, too. But I shall keep the place fer the sake of the situation. I\u0027ll want it a few hundred years from now, fer I don\u0027t expect to light upon a nicer spot.\" Isaac\u0027s eyes opened wide with amazement. He gave a slight start and looked keenly at Abner. \"Did you say \u0027a few hundred years?\u0027\" he asked. \"That\u0027s jist what I said. But it may be more, fer I can\u0027t tell how long it will take me to develop.\" \"Develop!\" \"Sure. Ye see, I\u0027ve been so long reachin\u0027 the Abner Andrews stage that I can\u0027t jist tell when I\u0027ll arrive.\" \"Arrive! Arrive where?\" \"At the angel stage where I kin live without eatin\u0027 an\u0027 workin\u0027. It\u0027s necessary fer a man to be sich a bein\u0027 to live on a place like this. That\u0027s what old Parson Shaw said after he\u0027d been at Plunkerville fer several years.\" \"So you expect to be an angel, do you?\" Isaac queried, while his mouth expanded into a grin. \"I\u0027m hopin\u0027 that way, providin\u0027 I don\u0027t git any set-back, which would delay me fer a few hundred years or so.\" \"Won\u0027t it be rather lonesome living here all by yourself?\" Isaac bantered. \"How will you occupy your time?\" \"Oh, I\u0027m not worrin\u0027 about that. I\u0027ll have plenty to do.\"\u0027 \"You will! Along what line?\" \"Lookin\u0027 after poultry; \u0027specially geese.\" \"Geese!\" \"Yes, that\u0027s what I\u0027ll be doin\u0027 judgin\u0027 from present indications. Guess most of the folks in Glucom will have reached the goose stage by that time, if I\u0027m not much mistaken. Most likely you\u0027ll be there, too, Ikey, though your pin-feathers won\u0027t be very tender. You\u0027ll surely be an old goose by that time.\" This was more than Isaac could stand. His face reddened, and his bland smile departed. \"What do you mean by insulting me?\" he demanded. \"You owe me an apology for those words.\" \"Ye\u0027r mistaken there, Ikey. It\u0027s the geese I should apologize to. I didn\u0027t mean to insult them poor critters.\" \"You\u0027re no gentleman,\" Isaac shouted, now fully aroused. \"You\u0027re nothing but an ignorant clown.\" \"Yes, I reckon I am. But I\u0027ll improve by the time I\u0027m ready to keep geese. Ye\u0027ll hardly know me then. But I\u0027ll know you, Ikey, fer no one could ever mistake that nose, even when it\u0027s changed into a goose\u0027s bill. There\u0027ll be lots of grubs and worms fer ye to feed on by the looks of things now.\" \"You impudent cur!\" Isaac roared. \"I didn\u0027t come here to be insulted, but to have a quiet talk about buying your place.\" \"No one asked ye to come, Ikey Dimock, an\u0027 the sooner ye go the better. Ye\u0027ve insulted me over an\u0027 over agin, an\u0027 thought it was all right. But two kin play at that game, an\u0027 by the jumpin\u0027-frog I\u0027ve a good mind to twist ye\u0027r measley neck.\" So fierce did Abner look that Isaac retreated a few steps. \"Oh, don\u0027t git scared,\" Abner laughed. \"I\u0027ll not hurt ye. But next time ye come to buy this place, bring ye\u0027r shot-gun along. I don\u0027t like to kill a man without givin\u0027 him a chance to defend himself.\" \"I\u0027ll bring a constable, that\u0027s who I\u0027ll bring.\" \"All right, bring the hull police force if ye want to. They kin set as long as they like by the side of the road an\u0027 watch me hoe. That\u0027s as fer as they\u0027ll git, fer I\u0027m king on me own ground, an\u0027 so long as I mind me own bizness I defy anyone to meddle with me. You\u0027re a trespasser here to-day, Ikey Dimock, an\u0027 the sooner ye hit fer the road the better fer all consarned.\" \"Yes, I\u0027m going, Abner Andrews,\" Isaac angrily replied. \"You have insulted me to-day, and have made a great bluster, but you\u0027ll come down with a flop when you\u0027re called upon to pay that thousand dollars you subscribed for the Orphans\u0027 Home.\" \"Hey, what\u0027s that ye\u0027r gittin\u0027 off?\" Abner demanded. \"What bizness is it of yours, I\u0027d like to know? Why should I flop when I\u0027m asked to pay?\" \"Simply because you haven\u0027t got it; that\u0027s why.\" \"What\u0027ll ye bet?\" \"I won\u0027t bet.\" \"No, because ye\u0027r scared. Ye know ye\u0027d lose.\" \"What\u0027s the sense of talking that way, Abner? I know that you were only bluffing when you offered that thousand dollars, and you can\u0027t deny it. How could you ever make that much on a place like this?\" \"By workin\u0027 the skin-game, that\u0027s how.\" \"The skin-game! What is that?\" \"Don\u0027t ye know, Ikey? Now, I skin the ground fer what I git, an\u0027 mighty thin skinnin\u0027 it is. But you skin human bein\u0027s, \u0027specially poor widders.\" Dimock waited to hear no more, but, turning angrily away, hastened across the field, boarded his car and drove furiously off. Abner watched him until he disappeared around the bend. \"Wasn\u0027t he mad, though?\" he chuckled. \"He got a flea in the ear that time, all right, ho, ho! It\u0027s not fer the situation or fer the sake of his health he wants this place, that\u0027s quite sartin. Dimock\u0027s not that kind. There\u0027s somethin\u0027 more\u0027n ordinary back of this, an\u0027 it\u0027s up to me to find out what it is.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1683/49574.html","bookId":1171,"book":{"id":1171,"title":"The Touch of Abner","description":"简介： These words drawled slowly forth produced an immediate effect, and caused fifty people to straighten suddenly up and look enquiringly around.
