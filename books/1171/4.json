When Jess announced that Isabel Rivers, her special friend at the Seminary, was to pay her a visit, Mrs. Andrews at once decided that the house must be thoroughly cleaned. Abner groaned inwardly as he listened to what would have to be done the next few days. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We must have everything spotless,\" his wife declared. \"It would not do for Belle Rivers to see a speck of dust around the house. I can hardly believe it true that she is coming, and her the daughter of Andrew Rivers, the famous, what do they call him, Jess?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Attorney General,\" was the reply. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Strange she\u0027d want to come here,\" Abner mused, as he puffed at his after-dinner pipe. \"She\u0027s society bred, like Lost Tribes\u0027 pig, an\u0027 I guess she\u0027ll find it mighty dull. She won\u0027t have much chance to put on airs at Ash Pint.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Belle\u0027s not that kind,\" Jess explained, \"as I have told you in my letters. She is fond of quiet life and country ways. We are both greatly interested in Social Service work, and we have planned to continue our studies while she is with me. You will both like her, I am sure.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s a wonder her parents don\u0027t want her, Joss.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She has only her father now, and he will be away from home for several weeks this summer. Belle is all he has, and she is the apple of his eye. Mrs. Rivers died last year, and poor Belle misses her so much. She was so grateful when I asked her to visit us.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, I s\u0027pose we kin stand her fer a while,\" and Abner gave a sigh of resignation. \"But, remember, ye mustn\u0027t expect me to be harnessed up in Sunday duds an\u0027 white collar every day. An\u0027 I don\u0027t want Social Service flung at my head every time I turn around.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Actual work began upon the parlor the very next day, and by noon the room had the appearance of having been struck by a cyclone. Blinds, curtains, and pictures were taken down; chairs and tables were piled out upon the verandah; mats were spread upon the grass, and the carpet hung upon the clothes-line. The old-fashioned piano, on account of its size, was the only thing left, and stood forlornly in its place, thickly covered with old copies of The Family Herald and Weekly Star. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That sartinly is a great paper,\" Abner mused, as he stood in the middle of the room viewing the effect. \"It\u0027s useful fer most anythin\u0027, as I told Sam Dobbins only yesterday, when he was yangin\u0027 about The Live Wire.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What was he saying about it?\" Mrs. Andrews unexpectedly asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, nuthin\u0027, nuthin\u0027 perticular, except that once it a fine account of his great-grandmother\u0027s funeral, that\u0027s all. Anythin\u0027 else ye want me to do, Tildy?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Certainly. You might as well beat that carpet. It\u0027s just full of dust.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n For over half an hour Abner whacked away at the carpet, pausing occasionally to sneeze and to wipe his perspiring face. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ugh!\" he groaned, during one of these resting spells. \"If this is Social Service work, then may the Lord help us!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You wanted to begin at home, though, didn\u0027t you, daddy?\" Jess laughingly asked, as she paused in the act of shaking a rug. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I know I did; fool that I was. But, look here, when anythin\u0027 has been dead, laid out, an\u0027 buried as long as that parlor has, it\u0027s a darn mistake to bring it to life agin.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But think how clean, fresh and sweet the room will be when we get done,\" Jess reminded. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Umph! De ye think I kin ever git this thing clean, fresh an\u0027 sweet?\" and Abner gave the wobbly carpet a savage bang. \"Look at that dust, now. The more I thump the thicker it gits. What\u0027s the use of carpets, anyway, I\u0027d like to know?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n After dinner Abner lighted his pipe, and picked up his old straw hat. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Guess I\u0027ll work at them pertaters this afternoon, Tildy,\" he announced. \"They\u0027re mighty weedy an\u0027 need hoein\u0027. I s\u0027pose you an\u0027 Jess kin finish that room, eh?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Indeed we can\u0027t,\" his wife replied. \"The ceiling has to be whitened, and that is a man\u0027s job. I\u0027ve got to wash those curtains, and do a hundred other things. The potatoes have gone so long already that I guess another day won\u0027t do them any harm. You\u0027ll find the whitening in a bag on the woodhouse shelf, and the brush is hanging on the wall.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Abner made no reply but strolled off to the woodhouse softly humming, \"When Bill Larkins made his money.\" Mrs. Andrews and Jess went on with their work, one washing the curtains; the other shaking mats and polishing the chairs upon the verandah. About an hour passed, and then from the parlor came a hair-raising yell, followed immediately by a thump. Jess and her mother nearly collided as they rushed into the room, where they saw Abner sitting upon the floor, his clothes covered with whitening. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"For pity sakes! what is the matter now?\" his wife demanded. \"Did you fall?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, I didn\u0027t fall, as ye kin see,\" was the reply. \"The darn old floor riz up an\u0027 hit me, that\u0027s all. Ugh!\" he groaned. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Where are you hurt, daddy?\" Jess asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Where am I hurt?\" and Abner glared at his daughter. \"Where de ye think I\u0027m hurt? Where do I look as if I\u0027m hurt; on me head?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I should say on your face, by the look of it,\" his wife retorted. \"I thought you had more sense than to put that chair upon such a rickety box. You might have broken your neck. What were you doing up there, anyway?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Follerin\u0027 Social Service methods; that\u0027s all, Tildy.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Social Service methods! Why, what do you mean?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ask Jess; she understands. It\u0027s an elevatin\u0027 process, ye see. I was jist elevatin\u0027 myself to put some plaster on that hole in the ceilin\u0027, when me under-pinnin\u0027 gave way. Did ye learn anythin\u0027 about the under-pinnin\u0027 at the Seminary, Jess?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not that I know of, daddy.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ye didn\u0027t! Well, that\u0027s queer. What was the use of ye\u0027r studyin\u0027 Social Service if ye didn\u0027t learn nuthin\u0027 about under-pinnin\u0027.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know what it is, daddy.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ye don\u0027t! Why, I thought everybody knew that under-pinnin\u0027 is what hold\u0027s things up.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, I see. You mean the foundation, or groundwork, so to speak.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, them may be the highfalutin\u0027 names, but I\u0027m used to under-pinnin\u0027. It comes more natural.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But what has that to do with Social Service?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A darn sight, I should say. Ye can\u0027t do nuthin\u0027 if the under-pinnin\u0027 ain\u0027t right, any more\u0027n I could stand fer long on that chair with the rickety box underneath. Lost Tribes was right when he said ye can\u0027t elevate a pig into nuthin\u0027 more\u0027n a hog. Ye\u0027d better allus be sure of ye\u0027r under-pinnin\u0027, Jess, before ye begin any elevatin\u0027 process. Now, there\u0027s Ikey Dimock, fer instance. If he hasn\u0027t a——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What\u0027s all this nonsense about, anyway?\" Mrs. Andrews interrupted. \"We\u0027ll never get through with this room if you two keep talking about \u0027Social Service\u0027 and \u0027Under-pinnin\u0027 all the time.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, I\u0027m through fer the present, Tildy,\" Abner declared. \"Guess I\u0027ll go outside fer a while an\u0027 shake off this Social Service dose. Jist leave the ceilin\u0027; I\u0027ll finish it later.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He shuffled stiffly out of the room, and made his way to a pile of wood a short distance from the house. He started to sit down upon a block but, suddenly changing his mind, he leaned against the clothes-line post instead. Pulling out a plug of tobacco and a knife, he had just whittled off several slices when an auto came in sight, and stopped in front of the house. A young man, neatly dressed, alighted and, walking briskly into the yard, came over to where Abner was standing. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is the boss in?\" he enquired. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, she was a few minutes ago.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Whew! Hen rule, eh?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Seems so. Like to see her?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not on your life. I want to see the old man. Is he around?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Guess he\u0027ll be around soon. Met with an accident ye see.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s too bad. Serious?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Pretty bad. His under-pinnin\u0027 gave way. Total collapse.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My, my! Sudden?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Very. Any message?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You work for him, I suppose?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I sartinly do.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is he a good boss?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Didn\u0027t ye ever meet him?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, never saw him. But I believe he\u0027s fixed all right by the way he forked over for that Orphan Home Slapped down a cool thousand at the first bang. The firm sent me out to try to sell him an auto. Do you think he wants one?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sure; he wants one bad.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He does? When do you suppose I could see him? He\u0027s a queer one, I understand.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, a regular divil when he gits goin\u0027. Shoots at sight.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You don\u0027t say so! Now, come to think of it, I did hear that he\u0027s a little touched in the head. Has strange notions of living a long time ago. Is that so?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Guess ye\u0027r right. The old feller\u0027s not altogether himself. He\u0027s lived so many lives that he often gits mixed up an\u0027 thinks he\u0027s old man Astor, Julius C?sar, or some other notable. He\u0027s not too bad then, but when he imagines he\u0027s one of them old pirates, ye\u0027d better watch out. He\u0027s a holy terror, an\u0027 nuthin\u0027 will stop him when he gits on the rampage.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Did he ever hurt you?\" the young man anxiously asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, no. Him an\u0027 me are great chums. He\u0027s never shot at me yit. We\u0027re too good friends fer that. I\u0027m his keeper, ye see, an\u0027 so he looks up to me fer most everything.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What! Is he as bad as all that? Does he really need a keeper?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sure. Why, I\u0027m the only one who kin manage him, next to his wife. He allus minds me no matter how bad he is. He ginerally does everythin\u0027 I say.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, that\u0027s interesting. I believe you\u0027re just the man I want. I suppose he\u0027d buy a car if you advised him to do so?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sure thing.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s great. Now, look here, if you\u0027ll speak a good word for me, I\u0027ll make it worth your while. And, say, here\u0027s something on account to prove that I mean business.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The young man thrust his hand into his pocket and brought forth a crisp bill, and handed it to Abner. \"Don\u0027t say a word about this little transaction,\" he warned. \"And you\u0027ll let me know when your boss is ready to buy, won\u0027t you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sure, sure; I\u0027ll let ye know. I\u0027ll put ye next to the old feller.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s good. Don\u0027t forget.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, I\u0027ll not fergit, not on ye\u0027r life.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, so long,\" and the salesman held out his hand. \"It\u0027s a bargain, remember, and more to come when the car is bought.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n As the young man started to leave, Jess came around the corner of the house carrying a rug, which she placed upon the clothes-line. At first she did not notice the two men, but stood for a few seconds looking down over the fields out upon the river. As she turned to re-enter the house by the back door, she espied the men, especially the stranger. In her brief glance she noted what a wretched object her father presented, with his old lime-bespattered clothes, by the side of the immaculately dressed young man. The latter noted the flush which mantled her face, and attributed it to shyness. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Gee whiz!\" he exclaimed, after Jess had entered the house. \"Where did she drop from?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"S-sh,\" Abner warned. \"She\u0027s the old man\u0027s daughter; a chip of the same block.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She is! Gad, she\u0027s a beaut.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, she\u0027s a trim craft, poor gal!\" Here he heaved a deep sigh, which the stranger was not slow to notice. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, what\u0027s wrong with her?\" the young man enquired. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Touched here, like her dad,\" and Abner placed the forefinger of his right hand to his head. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You don\u0027t say so! My, my, that\u0027s too bad! Inherited, I suppose?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Partly. She\u0027s got Social Service on the brain, ye see. But, there, ye\u0027d better go now. She was quite excited when she spotted you, an\u0027 if ye stay too long she might have a fit. Doesn\u0027t take much to set her off, poor thing.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Abner watched the salesman as he walked out of the yard, boarded his car, and set off down the road. Then his solemn face relaxed, and the sad expression fled from his eyes. The skin on his cheeks and under his eyes became suddenly corrugated, and his mouth expanded to a dangerous degree. His body shook, and he emitted a series of half-suppressed chuckles of merriment. He next unfolded the bill he was still holding in his hand, and looked at it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Whew! it\u0027s a ten-spot!\" he exclaimed. \"An\u0027 that guy thought he\u0027d bribe me with this, did he? He wanted me to put him next to the old feller. So that\u0027s the way he works his game, eh? Heard I\u0027m well fixed, too, an\u0027 was sent to sell me a car. A \u0027queer one,\u0027 an\u0027 a \u0027little touched in the head,\u0027 ho, ho! But mebbe he\u0027ll find the old feller\u0027s not so daft after all, an\u0027 that Abner Andrews, of Ash Pint, is afflicted with a different kind of a touch. That\u0027s what he will learn, skiddy-me-shins, if he won\u0027t.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1683/49572.html","bookId":1171,"book":{"id":1171,"title":"The Touch of Abner","description":"简介： These words drawled slowly forth produced an immediate effect, and caused fifty people to straighten suddenly up and look enquiringly around.
