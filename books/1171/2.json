Seeing the station agent busily reading The Live Wire he stepped toward the ticket-window and peered through. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Mornin\u0027, Sam,\" he accosted. \"How\u0027s the train?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Fifteen minutes late,\" the agent replied as he lowered his paper. \"You\u0027re early, Mr. Andrews. You\u0027ll have to wait nearly an hour.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, I don\u0027t mind that, Sam,\" and Abner reached down into his pocket as he spoke and brought forth a pipe, tobacco, and knife. \"I allus make a bizness of bein\u0027 ahead of time. I s\u0027pose ye often see people runnin\u0027 to catch the train, eh?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Indeed I do, and they generally make a lot of trouble for themselves and everybody else.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s jist it. I\u0027ve often told Tildy that if people\u0027d use their brains more an\u0027 their legs less it\u0027d be a darn sight better fer all consarned. What\u0027s the news, Sam?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, haven\u0027t you seen the paper this morning, Mr. Andrews?\" the agent asked in surprise. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Naw, I don\u0027t go much on dailies; they\u0027ve too many \u0027vertisement. I take the Family Herald and git a hull library every week fer one dollar a year. Ye kin find most everythin\u0027 ye want in the Herald from raisin\u0027 hogs to teethin\u0027 babies. It\u0027s sartinly great.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But The Live Wire should interest you this morning, Mr. Andrews. It has a long article on the meeting last night, and about your generous gift toward the Orphan Home.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ye don\u0027t tell! Well, I guess I know as much about last night\u0027s meetin\u0027 as the feller who was there waggin\u0027 the pen. That\u0027s the trouble with The Live Wire; it tells ye things ye already know.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Although Abner pretended to be completely indifferent about the account of the meeting, in reality he was most anxious to read what the paper had to say about it. But after what he had said about the dailies, it would not do for him to back down now. The agent would have a laugh at his expense. He could buy a copy at the drug-store up the street. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Keep an eye on my hoss, will ye, Sam? I\u0027ve got to git some corn-salve fer Tildy. She fergot it yesterday, an\u0027 her corns were mighty bad last night.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is your horse afraid of trains, Mr. Andrews?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Afraid of trains! Well, I guess ye don\u0027t know Jerry. Why, that hoss likes a noise better\u0027n he does his oats.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s curious, isn\u0027t it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"S\u0027pose \u0027tis. But ye see, Jerry was raised in a pasture near the railroad, an\u0027 then he lived in town fer a few years. After I bought him an\u0027 took him to Ash Pint, it was so quiet there he began to pine an\u0027 pine, an\u0027 wouldn\u0027t eat nor drink. Thinkin\u0027 he was goin\u0027 to die, I brought him to town to see the hoss doctor. But, skiddy-me-shins, if he didn\u0027t buck right up as soon as he heard the whistle of the train. He was like a new hoss.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Has he got over the quietness of the country yet?\" the agent enquired. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not altogether. He kin stand it fer a few days, an\u0027 then when I see he\u0027s longin\u0027 fer the trains, I tak\u0027 the big tin horn and blow it close to his ears fer all I\u0027m worth. That cheers him up a bit; but there\u0027s nothin\u0027 like the yell of one of them big en-gines to give him solid comfort. Jerry is sartinly a knowin\u0027 hoss.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Abner left the waiting-room and sauntered along the street in the direction of the drug-store. He knew all the business men in Glucom, and they always spoke or nodded to him in passing. But this morning the ones he met seemed unusually friendly, and stopped to shake hands, and enquire after his health. It was Lawyer Rackshaw, however, who was the most effusive. He met Abner just in front of the drug-store, and accosted him as a long-lost friend. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How is your wife, Mr. Andrews, and your pretty daughter?\" he asked, at the same time shaking the farmer\u0027s hand most vigorously. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Say, let up,\" Abner protested, as he struggled to free his hand. \"De ye think I\u0027m an old pump? If ye\u0027r dry, come into the store, an\u0027 we\u0027ll have a sody together. That\u0027s the best I kin do fer ye this mornin\u0027.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ha, ha,\" the lawyer laughed. \"I guess you\u0027re worth pumping, all right, Mr. Andrews. A man who can flash up a thousand, such as you did at the meeting last night, must have more where that came from, eh? \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If I have, it\u0027s because I have taken darn good care to keep out of the way of lawyers,\" Abner retorted. \"But, there, I must git along,\" he added, \"an\u0027 buy Tildy a corn-salve before the train comes in.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, you have plenty of time,\" and the lawyer pulled out his watch. \"Why, you\u0027ve half an hour yet. But, say, Mr. Andrews, I\u0027ve been reading the account of last night\u0027s meeting. My, I admire your pluck. You did certainly put it over Ikey Dimock all right. Ha, ha, that was a good one. You\u0027ve seen the paper, I suppose?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Naw, I don\u0027t go much on papers,\" was the reply. \"I seldom read \u0027em.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But you must read this one, though. Here, you may have mine.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Abner took the paper, and thrust it into his pocket. \"Thank ye, I\u0027ll read it when I git time. I must be off now, or I\u0027ll be late fer the train.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Have a cigar, Mr. Andrews. Here\u0027s a rare Havana. I know you\u0027re fond of a good smoke.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How many of these de ye smoke a day, Mr. Rackshaw?\" Abner asked, as he carefully studied the band upon the cigar. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, generally five or six, and sometimes more. It all depends on what I am doing.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Cost quite a bit, eh?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, I suppose I burn between two and three hundred dollars during the year.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ye don\u0027t tell! Bizness must be good, eh? I kin hardly afford to keep me old pipe goin\u0027, let alone smoke cigars.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, that\u0027s the way you\u0027ve been able to save, Mr. Andrews, and have a nice sum to give for the orphanage. Isn\u0027t that so?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How much d\u0027 you intend to fork over fer that Home, Mr. Rackshaw?\" Abner enquired. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I? Oh, I shall give my services free; that will be my contribution.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"H\u0027m, in what way?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There will be considerable work to be done, such as legal advice, and other important matters to be attended to. I intend to do all that for nothing.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, that is generous of ye, Mr. Rackshaw. I s\u0027pose sich things will be needed, no doubt. From what I understand, others in town are goin\u0027 to do the same as you, an\u0027 so the poor little orphans will be housed, an\u0027 clothed, an\u0027 fed by the advice an\u0027 good wishes of all. It sartinly will be a great institution. Now, look here,\" and Abner suddenly reached out and laid his big right hand upon the lawyer\u0027s shoulder, \"I want to give ye a word of advice.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Excuse me, Mr. Andrews,\" and Rackshaw stepped back a pace. \"I must hurry away. I have important business on hand, which must be attended to at once. And, besides, I must not detain you any longer, as you might be late for the train. Good-morning, Mr. Andrews.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Abner bought the corn-salve, and made his way back to the station. He chuckled to himself as he moved along the street, and his eyes twinkled with amusement. Finding that he had ten minutes to spare, he seated himself upon a box on the platform, and drew forth the copy of The Live Wire. As he did so his hand touched the cigar in his vest pocket. He pulled it out, and looked it over. Then he scratched the back of his head with the fingers of his left hand. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Wonder what that bait\u0027s fer?\" he mused. \"Rackshaw didn\u0027t part with that cigar fer nuthin\u0027. He\u0027s fishin\u0027 fer somethin\u0027, all right. But, skiddy-me-shins, he\u0027ll have to use different bait than that if he expects to catch Abner Andrews, of Ash Pint.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Replacing the cigar, he unfolded the paper, and began to read the account of the meeting, which occupied the leading place on the front page. The reporter had written a most stirring article, and had recorded every word that Abner had uttered, including his tilt with Isaac Dimock. Then followed a list of those who had contributed, with Abner\u0027s name leading for one thousand dollars. The other amounts were small, the largest being fifty dollars from the chairman, Henry Whittles. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Great snakes!\" Abner exclaimed in disgust. \"Is that all Whittles gave, an\u0027 him the richest man in town! I wonder——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But just then the train blew. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1683/49570.html","bookId":1171,"book":{"id":1171,"title":"The Touch of Abner","description":"简介： These words drawled slowly forth produced an immediate effect, and caused fifty people to straighten suddenly up and look enquiringly around.
