{"id":15635,"no":24,"title":"CHAPTER XXIV","content":"EXIT BILLY \"What in the world\u0027s keepin\u0027 \u0027em?\" Abner was standing before the fire he had built on the shore, and supper was all ready. It needed only the arrival of Jess and Royden, and they were long in coming. Belle smiled as she watched Abner and listened to his remarks about people being late for their meals. Mrs. Andrews and the children were already seated on the ground, but Abner would not let them touch a thing until all were present. \"It ain\u0027t good manners,\" he declared, when his wife protested. \"We\u0027ve company fer supper, an\u0027 I guess it\u0027s the fashion fer \u0027em allus to be late. I know it was so when I was a kid. Now, I remember once when—-\" \"Here they come now,\" one of the boys shouted, with delight. Abner fixed his eyes sternly upon the lad who had interrupted him. \"Look here, sonny,\" he began, \"don\u0027t ye know any better\u0027n that, to speak when ye\u0027r uncle\u0027s about begin a story? You need a dose of Social Service, all right. Jess\u0027ll have to git busy.\" Belle laughed heartily at Abner\u0027s words and looks in which the children all joined. They had no fear of him, and were always much delighted when he took any notice of them. Jess was very animated, and looked prettier than ever so Abner thought, as she and Royden drew near. Her cheeks were flushed, and she merely smiled at her father\u0027s bantering words. \"My, this looks good!\" she exclaimed, as she sat down by her father\u0027s side and examined the supper. \"This is something like living.\" \"This is real Social Service, Jess,\" Abner remarked. \"Ye may use all the elevatin\u0027 schemes in the world, but they don\u0027t cut no ice unless ye\u0027r under-pinnin\u0027 is right, as I told ye once before. Now, the real under-pinnin\u0027,\u0027 to my way of thinkin\u0027, is grub.\" \"How do you make that out, daddy?\" Jess asked, as her father paused to sip his tea. \"How do I make that out? Well, jist try an\u0027 ye\u0027ll soon find out fer ye\u0027rself. Soap an\u0027 water are all right; I daresen\u0027t say nuthin\u0027 agin\u0027 \u0027em, fer Tildy is here, an\u0027 she\u0027s great on sich things. But back of soap an\u0027 water, an\u0027 art an\u0027 music, an\u0027 all other things ye learnt at the Seminary, there must be grub, or else ye\u0027r Social Service plans\u0027ll fall flatter\u0027n did Lawyer Rackshaw the day I stuck the hot end of me cigar into his measely nose. Ho, ho, that was a joke, an\u0027 I\u0027ll tell yez about it some day. No, ye must have grub as ye\u0027r under-pinnin\u0027, Jess, even if ye expect to elevate a pig into a hog.\" Billy was the only one who did not seem to be enjoying himself. He ate his supper in silence, and when he was through, he sat a little apart smoking the inevitable cigarette. There was reason for this. Belle would have nothing to do with him. She kept very close to Abner before supper, and talked and chatted with him in the most animated manner. But when Billy tried to divert her attention she told him each time that she was very busy. He was sulky, too, over the way Abner had deceived him in making him believe that he was the hired man. It did not improve his mood when he saw Jess and Royden so happy together. He felt that he had been badly treated, and that his experience with the bull had been planned by Abner and the surveyor. He brooded over these things while the rest laughed and talked, and enjoyed themselves thoroughly. When it was time to go home, Jess stepped into the canoe, and Royden stood at the bow ready to push it off from the shore. The others were to go in the big flat-bottomed boat, and were already on board, except Abner. He was searching around to see that nothing was left behind before shoving the boat into the water. Billy had taken his seat next to Belle, feeling certain that she could not escape him now. But to his surprise that young lady suddenly stood up and stepped ashore. \"Is there room for me?\" she asked Royden, who was now paddling close by. \"Sure,\" was the reply, as he ran the bow gently upon the beach. In an instant Belle was aboard, and as the canoe cut through the water, she waved her hand to Billy. \"I hope you will have a nice time,\" she bantered. \"It\u0027s great here.\" Abner chuckled with delight, and even Mrs. Andrews\u0027 face relaxed into a smile, as they realized why she had left them. But Billy was furious. He sprang out of the boat, and ordered Royden to bring back the canoe. The surveyor paid no attention, however, but paddled steadily away. This angered Billy all the more, and he swore and stamped on the ground in his fury. \"Here, cut that out,\" Abner commanded. \"I\u0027ll give ye somethin\u0027 to dance fer in real ernest if ye don\u0027t. Hustle up an\u0027 git on board. I want to be off.\" \"Go to h—l,\" was the angry retort. \"I\u0027m going to stay here.\" Abner was about to leap ashore and administer the chastisement the cur deserved. But he soon changed his mind, while a smile flitted across his face. \"All right,\" he replied, \"stay where ye are. Ye kin be old Robinson Crusoe fer all I care. Good-bye, me beauty, an\u0027 pleasant dreams to ye to-night. Ye kin eat the bull if ye\u0027r hungry.\" Pushing off the boat, he seized the oars and settled himself down to work. They had gone but a short distance when a yell from Billy fell upon their ears. He was standing upon the shore, frantically waving his arms, and imploring them to return. The cause of his distress was at once apparent, for coming toward him from the rear was the bull, pawing and growling in an angry manner. It had evidently recovered from its fright, and was seeking revenge upon his enemies. It may have been longing for human companionship in his loneliness, though Billy did not fancy the brute\u0027s company, no matter how friendly he might prove. He was wild with terror, and his cries increased the nearer the animal approached. \"Oh, hurry back, Abner,\" Mrs. Andrews implored. \"The poor fellow will be killed.\" \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 to stay right here,\" Abner announced. \"If Billy wants to come on board he kin wade. I offered to take him, but he refused. It\u0027s up to him now to make the next move.\" Billy was not long in doing this. As the bull drew near, and he saw that the boat was not returning, he plunged into the water and waded as fast as he could, casting frightened glances back over his shoulder at his enemy. \"Ye\u0027r doin\u0027 fine,\" Abner encouraged, at which all the children shouted with laughter. It was great sport for them to see the man stumbling and splashing along, and groaning at every step. \"So that\u0027s the second bath ye\u0027ve had to-day,\" Abner remarked, after Billy had scrambled into the boat. \"Guess ye\u0027r hide\u0027s cleaner than it\u0027s been since ye\u0027r mother tubbed ye. It\u0027s a pity the same can\u0027t be done to that dirty mouth of yours.\" Billy made no reply, but sat shivering on one of the seats. \"Are ye cold?\" Abner asked. \"I do feel that way.\" \"Take the oars, then, an\u0027 warm ye\u0027rself up. There\u0027s a chilly breeze sprung up, an\u0027 ye might catch cold. It \u0027ud be too bad to lose sich a valuable person. Don\u0027t know how the world \u0027ud wag along.\" Reluctantly Billy took Abner\u0027s place, and began to row. But he was like a child at the work, and the boat, with no keel, went around and around in a circle. \"Say, where are ye takin\u0027 us?\" Abner asked. \"I\u0027m gittin\u0027 dizzy.\" \"But I can\u0027t keep the d—d thing straight,\" was the reply. \"There\u0027s something wrong with the boat or with these oars.\" \"Here, give \u0027em to me,\" Abner ordered. \"I don\u0027t want any more wheels in me head. The fault\u0027s not with the oars or the boat, young man, but with you. Now, watch how I do it. My, you\u0027d be great in a race with a dog chasin\u0027 its tail, wouldn\u0027t ye?\" It did not take long to reach the shore, and all to land. Abner spoke a word to his wife, and she at once left with the children for the house. He remained a few minutes behind with Billy, and when the latter left and headed for the main highway, Abner picked up the remaining basket and walked slowly up through the field. He chuckled several times and twice turned and looked to see how far Billy had gone. When Abner reached the house he was surprised at the commotion which was taking place in the dooryard. A big truck was standing there, loaded with provisions. It had just arrived and the driver was asking Mrs. Andrews where he should put the stuff. The latter was somewhat bewildered, and was trying to make the man understand that there must have been some mistake, and that the goods could not be intended for them. \"But it\u0027s all marked for Abner Andrews, of Ash Point,\" the man insisted. \"There\u0027s no mistake about that. I\u0027ve brought it, and here it\u0027s going to stay.\" \"Very well, then,\" Mrs. Andrews replied. \"Here comes my husband, and you can talk with him.\" Abner was greatly astonished at the truck-load of goods and questioned the driver most closely. He could only learn, however, that the supplies had been sent from Dill \u0026 McBain, leading grocers of Glucom, and that was all he knew about it. \"It\u0027s for you, though, Mr. Andrews,\" the driver insisted. \"I\u0027m certain. I have made no mistake. Mr. Dill himself looked after the stuff, which is unusual for him, and he warned me not to leave it anywhere else.\" \"It sartinly is queer,\" and Abner scratched his head in perplexity. \"Can\u0027t imagine where it all came from. Howsomever, here it is, an\u0027 so ye might as well dump it off, while I stow it away. Plenty of room\u0027s about the only thing which we have about this place at present.\" As the driver unloaded the goods Abner stored them away in the woodhouse adjoining the room fitted up for the children. There were several barrels of flour, sides of ham, slabs of bacon, sugar, rice, and boxes filled with all kinds of things. When they were at last stored away and the driver had departed, Abner and his wife stood looking at the articles with a puzzled expression upon their faces. \"Well, I\u0027ll be blessed if I kin understand this!\" Abner exclaimed. \"Where de ye s\u0027pose them things have come from?\" \"They came from town, all right,\" Mrs. Andrews replied. \"But I\u0027d like to know who sent them. Maybe you\u0027ll get a bill later, Abner. You haven\u0027t been doing any more of your crazy actions, have you? Are you sure you didn\u0027t order these things, thinking you were old man Astor, or some other rich ancestor?\" \"Should say not. I don\u0027t know no more about \u0027em than you do, Tildy. It may have been one of me wealthy ancestors, though,\" he mused. \"Ye kin never tell what them spirits are goin\u0027 to do next.\" \"H\u0027m, I guess the spirits who sent all those things are flesh and blood like ourselves, and know how badly off we are. But here comes Belle. She may know something about them.\" Belle was alone, and Jess and Royden were nowhere to be seen. She was delighted when she saw the provisions, and her eyes danced. \"Oh, I am so glad they have come,\" she exclaimed. \"You won\u0027t have to worry any more now, will you?\" and she turned to Abner. \"Worry! How did you know we was worryin\u0027?\" Abner asked in amazement. \"Oh, I know a thing or two,\" and the girl smiled. \"I am not altogether blind, even though I am a little giddy at times.\" \"An\u0027 de ye know where them things came from?\" \"I have a fairly good idea,\" \"Ye have!\" \"Why, yes,\" and again Belle smiled at Abner\u0027s astonishment. \"I think my father sent them.\" \"He did! Ye\u0027r father! How in blazes did he know how we was fixed?\" \"I write to him, don\u0027t I? It was only natural that I should tell him about the boys we have here, and how the people of Glucom acted about that Orphans\u0027 Home, wasn\u0027t it?\" \"Sure, sure. An\u0027 ye\u0027r dad didn\u0027t send them things out of charity, did he?\" \"Charity to the children, of course,\" was Belle\u0027s evasive reply. \"He knows how greatly interested I am in the boys, and he sent those things merely to help along the work. My father is fond of doing such things and he wouldn\u0027t like it one bit if he knew that I have told on him. If you want to save me from a big scolding don\u0027t say anything to him about it. I shall write at once and tell him that they have arrived, and so that will be enough. Now, you must both promise me that you won\u0027t say anything to my father about what he has done. You will, won\u0027t you?\" As neither Abner nor Mrs. Andrews made any reply, Belle looked keenly into their faces, thinking that perhaps they were offended. Great was her surprise to see tears stealing slowly down Mrs. Andrews\u0027 cheeks. She brushed them hurriedly away, but not before Belle had seen her emotion. \"Oh, Mrs. Andrews, I didn\u0027t mean to offend you,\" Belle explained. \"I\u0027m afraid I have hurt your feelings. I thought you would understand. I am so sorry.\" In reply, Mrs. Andrews threw her arms about the girl\u0027s neck, and began to weep, a most unusual thing for her. \"You dear good girl,\" she sobbed. \"You have not offended us. But I am completely overcome by your kindness.\" Abner turned his face away and softly hummed, \"When Bill Larkins made his money.\" Belle touched him gently on the arm. \"Are you offended, Mr. Andrews?\" she asked. Abner swung suddenly around, and there was a mistiness in his eyes. \"Offended!\" he repeated. \"I\u0027m not offended one bit, but I have a queer, creepy feelin\u0027, which I haven\u0027t had since the first time I saw Jess, when she was put in me arms as a tiny little mite. Why, I nearly blubbered right out, an\u0027 me a big strong man at that! Jist think of it!\" \"I am so glad that you\u0027re not offended,\" Belle replied. \"And if you feel as you say you do, then everything is all right.\" \"Why, I couldn\u0027t help feelin\u0027 any other way. Guess them peaceful spirits of mine must be hoverin\u0027 round by the appearance of things. Billy didn\u0027t think so, though, this afternoon, did he?\" \"Oh, I forgot all about that man,\" and Belle looked around, as if she expected to see him. \"He couldn\u0027t have made much impression on ye, eh?\" and Abner\u0027s eyes twinkled. \"He\u0027s got it bad, Billy has; but I guess he won\u0027t commit suicide yit awhile.\" \"Where did he go to, anyway?\" Belle asked. \"He didn\u0027t come to the house, did he?\" \"Should say not. I had a quiet little interview with him down on the shore. I had a heart to heart talk with him; told him that he was in danger of injurin\u0027 the morals of the kids, an\u0027 that \u0027distance lends enchantment,\u0027 as old Parson Shaw uster to say.\" \"Was he willing to go?\" \"Willin\u0027! Well, he wasn\u0027t overly anxious at first, but he soon changed his mind, let me tell ye that. When he saw that me warlike ancestors were gittin\u0027 busy, an\u0027 that they were inspirin\u0027 me, he more\u0027n took the hint, an\u0027 lit out. Ye won\u0027t have no more bother with him, Belle. If ye do, jist let me know; that\u0027s all ye have to do.\" \"Thank you, Mr. Andrews,\" was the reply. \"I don\u0027t want to see him again. He gives me a creepy feeling, very different from yours, though.\" At that moment Jess and Royden appeared, looking very happy and animated. They had enjoyed the afternoon and evening, and Billy\u0027s troubles did not in the least mar their pleasure.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1683/49592.html","bookId":1171,"book":{"id":1171,"title":"The Touch of Abner","description":"简介： These words drawled slowly forth produced an immediate effect, and caused fifty people to straighten suddenly up and look enquiringly around.
