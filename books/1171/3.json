{"id":15614,"no":3,"title":"CHAPTER III","content":"SOCIETY PIGS There was little wonder that Abner suddenly straightened himself up while an expression of pride beamed in his eyes, as Jess stepped from the train, and hurried toward him. Nature had been kind to this girl of eighteen, and had endowed her with more than an ordinary charm of form and features. Joy and health radiated from her every movement as naturally and unconsciously as an orchard in bloom sheds its sweetness. Her sympathetic nature and impulsive disposition caused her to be beloved by all who knew her, and Jess Andrews was a general favorite. The eyes of several youths followed her closely as she hurried along the platform to where her father was standing. \"Have you been waiting long, daddy dear?\" she asked, after she had given him an affectionate hug and kiss. \"Not overly long,\" Abner replied, as he held her at arm\u0027s length, and viewed her with undisguised admiration. \"My you\u0027ve grown,\" he added. \"Ye look jist like a peach.\" \"Do I?\" Jess laughingly asked, as she brushed back a wayward tress of dark-brown hair. \"It has been so long since I have seen a peach that I hardly know what one looks like. I wish I had one now, as I am almost starved. I wouldn\u0027t look at it long, I can tell you.\" \"Well, let\u0027s git home at once,\" Abner replied. \"Ye\u0027r ma has some fine preserved peaches, which she\u0027s been keepin\u0027 fer ye, an\u0027 she wouldn\u0027t let me touch \u0027em. Jerry is over there by that post. I brought the express along this mornin\u0027 so\u0027s to take ye\u0027r trunk. I\u0027ll go an\u0027 git it right off.\" Jess went over and stroked Jerry\u0027s glossy neck, and gave him the last chocolate she possessed. It merely whetted his appetite, and he eagerly begged for more, by pawing the ground and thrusting his nose into the friendly hand. \"You have a sweet tooth, haven\u0027t you, old boy?\" and Jess again patted his neck. \"You shall have two pieces of candy when I get more, though dear knows when that will be,\" she regretfully sighed. \"I am hard up, Jerry, as I spent my last cent on these chocolates, and don\u0027t like to ask daddy for any more money, for I know how difficult it has been for him to pay my bills at the Seminary. But, never mind, when I get to work I shall have plenty. But here comes daddy now.\" Abner approached, trundling Jess\u0027 trunk upon a truck he had procured from the station agent. He dumped his load upon the ground at the rear of the wagon, and then stooped to lift the trunk up into the express. As he did so, the copy of The Live Wire slipped from his coat pocket and fell at his feet. Jess at once stepped forward and picked it up. \"Hi, there; what are ye doin\u0027?\" Abner enquired, as he suddenly straightened himself up, and looked quickly around. \"You dropped this, that\u0027s all,\" and Jess held up the paper as she spoke. \"Here, give me that,\" was the peremptory order. \"It\u0027s dangerous.\" \"Dangerous! What do you mean?\" \"It\u0027ll cause an explosion, if ye\u0027r not careful, \u0027specially if ye open it. \u0027Taint safe.\" \"Why, it\u0027s only The Live Wire, daddy! It surely can\u0027t do any harm.\" \"Yes, it will, jist as soon as ye open it. There\u0027d be sich an explosion that it \u0027ud fairly take me head off.\" Into the girl\u0027s eyes came a mingled expression of fear and surprise. What did her father mean by such words? Could there be anything wrong with his brain? He had never acted so strangely before. \"Are ye goin\u0027 to give me that paper?\" Abner asked. \"Certainly,\" Jess replied as she acceded to his request. \"But I think you might tell me what makes it so dangerous, daddy.\" \"High explosives, that\u0027s what \u0027tis. It\u0027s worse than nitro-glycerine, which goes off jist as soon as ye look at it.\" \"But you should not carry it, then, daddy. If it is not safe for me to touch, neither is it for you, so there.\" \"Oh, I know how to handle it,\" Abner chuckled, as he thrust the paper back into his pocket. \"Climb up now, an\u0027 let\u0027s be off.\" \"There is something in it you don\u0027t want me to see; isn\u0027t that it?\" Jess asked. \"Mebbe there is. Anyway, I don\u0027t want to be blown to bits. Whoa, there, Jerry. What\u0027s the matter with ye? Take the reins, Jess, an\u0027 hold that hoss. He\u0027s jist dyin\u0027 fer an explosion. I kin tell it by the way he twists his ears.\" As soon as Abner had hoisted the trunk up into the express, he climbed over the wheel, took his seat by his daughter\u0027s side, seized the reins, and headed Jerry for home. \"You didn\u0027t take the truck back,\" Jess reminded him as soon as they had started. \"Well, neither I did! But, never mind, Sam\u0027ll git it. He might as well be doin\u0027 somethin\u0027, the lazy rascal. It\u0027s his bizness to wait on the public, an\u0027 we\u0027re as much the public as anybody. G\u0027long, Jerry.\" \"My, I\u0027m glad to be back,\" and Jess gave a deep sigh of contentment. \"I never saw the fields look so pretty, nor the trees such a wonderful variety of green. I missed all that at the Seminary. That beautiful maple over there in front of Mr. Sanders\u0027 house seems to have grown since I went away.\" \"H\u0027m,\" Abner grunted, \"Joe should cut that down; it hides the view.\" \"Oh, daddy, don\u0027t say that. Just think what such a tree means. There is so much in it.\" \"Y\u0027bet there is; more\u0027n a cord of good firewood.\" \"I don\u0027t mean that, daddy. I wasn\u0027t thinking of the wood, but of the beauty of form and color on golden, summer days, and the mystic music when the wind is rushing through its branches.\" \"Oh, it\u0027s them things ye\u0027r thinkin\u0027 of. Well, mebbe ye\u0027r right. But a piece of good dry maple in our old stove on a cold day in winter gives all the poetry an\u0027 music I want. Guess ye\u0027ve been studyin\u0027 sich things at the Seminary, eh?\" \"For a time we did. But this last term most of us were greatly interested in Social Service studies.\" \"Ye don\u0027t tell! What\u0027s that, anyway? A new kind of religion or prayer-meetin\u0027, eh?\" \"Oh, no,\" and Jess laughed merrily. \"It is merely social reform, that is, efforts to lessen and remove existing evils.\" \"Well, that\u0027s interestin\u0027. Pretty big problem, I should say; almost as hard as clearin\u0027 a dog\u0027s hide of fleas.\" \"Much harder, daddy. You see, we have to deal with human nature at its lowest, and elevate it step by step.\" \"Oh, now I begin to spy daylight. Ye\u0027r to be a kind of human elevator, sich as they have in big stores, which boosts ye from cellar to garret quicker\u0027n ye kin say \u0027jack-rabbit.\u0027\" \"It\u0027s something like that, only this is a long and difficult work, needing no end of patience. It means not only fighting such evils as the liquor traffic, horse-racing, gambling, graft and such things, but we must educate people as to the proper training and welfare of children, and teach them how to keep their houses clean and free from diseases. I could not begin to tell you all the subjects Social Service includes.\" \"It sartinly must cover a heap of ground,\" Abner mused, as he flicked Jerry gently with the whip. \"But does it tell ye how to cook, darn socks, sew on buttons, an\u0027 do sich ordinary household work?\" \"Why, no!\" and Jess looked her surprise. \"It\u0027s not supposed to include such things.\" \"H\u0027m, is that so? Well, it seems to me that\u0027s the kind of social reform we need. Most of the gals these days tweedle-dee at the pianner, gass about art, study the fashion magazines, an\u0027 read the new novels, but as fer cookin\u0027, sewin\u0027, an\u0027 darnin\u0027, why, they know no more about sich things than a cat knows about a thrashin\u0027 machine.\" \"But I know, daddy,\" Jess reminded. \"Mother taught me, you remember, before I left home.\" \"Sure, she did, an\u0027 she larnt ye well, too. She laid the timbers all right, keel, kilson, an\u0027 all. But, skiddy-me-shins, if ye\u0027r goin\u0027 to carry all that Social Service sail, ye\u0027ll be a mighty different craft from what ye\u0027r mother planned. Ye sartinly won\u0027t do fer ordinary home waters, let me tell ye that. Ye\u0027ll need a darn more sea room than kin be found at Ash Pint.\" \"Certainly, daddy, that\u0027s just it. I intend to go to some big city where the needs are great, and help to carry on social reform work.\" \"Ye do!\" Abner\u0027s hands dropped limp upon his knees, and a troubled expression overspread his wrinkled face. The merry twinkle left his eyes, and the wrinkles upon his bronzed forehead seemed to deepen. \"Why, I thought ye was a-goin\u0027 to stay home, Jess,\" he at length continued. \"Ye\u0027r ma an\u0027 me was settin\u0027 great store upon ye\u0027r comin\u0027 back, an\u0027 castin\u0027 anchor at Ash Pint.\" \"I couldn\u0027t think of doing that, daddy. And besides, you have already said that I am not fitted for home waters, didn\u0027t you? I certainly do need more sea room.\" \"But couldn\u0027t ye take a reef or two in ye\u0027r sail, Jess? There\u0027s considerable social work to be done right here, so why not cruise around a while in this parish? I guess ye\u0027ll find enough to keep ye busy fer a year or two at least.\" \"Why, what can I do, daddy?\" \"Well, I can\u0027t recall all the needs. But there\u0027s Glucom, fer instance. It\u0027s right handy, an\u0027 it needs its back yards cleaned up, an\u0027 other things attended to; it sartinly does. Ye might start with Ikey Dimock, an\u0027 Lawyer Rackshaw, an\u0027 I think ye\u0027d find enough in their cellars an\u0027 basements to occupy ye fer a long time.\" \"Why, daddy, I didn\u0027t know their places needed looking after. Their wives are leaders of Glucom society, and surely conditions are not as bad as you make out.\" \"I\u0027m not sayin\u0027 anythin\u0027 about their wives, fer I\u0027ve learned since marryin\u0027 ye\u0027r ma to speak very keerful about women. I was merely referrin\u0027 to the men. But, remember, society ain\u0027t allus what it seems, fer many a frog kicks up a big fuss an\u0027 holler on a rotten log, an\u0027 roosters often crow the loudest on a manure heap. I guess if ye knew as much as I do about the way Ikey Dimock an\u0027 Lawyer Rackshaw, to say nuthin\u0027 of others, made their money ye\u0027d find that I\u0027m not fer astray. G\u0027long, Jerry.\" \"But what could I do with such people, daddy? They would resent any interference on my part. They are leaders of society, you know. We work among a different class of people.\" \"Yes, I suppose so. But ye told me that Social Service work includes the liquor traffic, gamblin\u0027, graft, an\u0027 sich things, so that\u0027s why I mentioned Glucom. It\u0027s sartinly a fine field fer operations.\" \"I shall think it over, daddy,\" and Jess gave a deep sigh. Abner\u0027s eyes twinkled, and he glanced toward his daughter. \"S\u0027pose ye try ye\u0027r hand at home, Jess,\" he suggested. \"In what way?\" \"Oh, upon me an\u0027 ye\u0027r ma. We need a little reformin\u0027, an\u0027 the old house wants to be made a darn sight more sanitary than it is.\" \"Why, what do you mean?\" Jess asked in surprise. \"Well, ye see, me an\u0027 ye\u0027r ma haven\u0027t been sproutin\u0027 any extry angel-wings since ye left home, Jess. We\u0027ve been havin\u0027 too much of each other\u0027s company, I guess, an\u0027 ye know that ye git tired even of the best candy an\u0027 chocolates if ye have too much of \u0027em. Then, we\u0027ve been livin\u0027 in the kitchen, eatin\u0027 an\u0027 settin\u0027 there. We never use the dinin\u0027-room, an\u0027 as fer the parlor, well, the blinds have been down fer so long that I have the creeps whenever I go into that room. No, it ain\u0027t sanitary. The house needs more sunshine; a cheery voice now an\u0027 then, an\u0027 some music on that old pianner once in a while. I tell ye the state of affairs at our house ain\u0027t nat\u0027ral. A funeral is necessary occasionally, I s\u0027pose, but ye\u0027d think we was havin\u0027 a funeral at our house every day of the week. Yes, Jess, we need ye\u0027r social reform work right at home as much as anywheres else. Hello! What\u0027s this?\" They had rounded the bend in the road when they saw an elderly man approaching, carrying with difficulty a rough box upon his shoulder. \"Why, it\u0027s Zeb Burns!\" Abner exclaimed. \"What in the world is he up to now? Hello, Zeb,\" he accosted, as he pulled up his horse. \"Not movin\u0027, are ye?\" \"What de ye think I\u0027m doin\u0027, then?\" was the retort. \"Do I look as if I\u0027ve been settin\u0027 under the shade of an apple tree all the mornin\u0027?\" Zeb thumped the box down upon the ground, pulled forth a big red pocket-handkerchief, and mopped his perspiring face. As the box touched mother earth, a piercing squeal sounded forth, followed by several protesting grunts. \"Oh, it\u0027s a pig ye\u0027ve got!\" and Abner leaned over to obtain a better view. \"One of the Chosen Tribes, I s\u0027pose, ha, ha.\" \"No, it\u0027s not; it\u0027s the devil in pig\u0027s clothin\u0027; that\u0027s what it is. It\u0027s been cussin\u0027 an\u0027 squealin\u0027 an\u0027 kickin\u0027 ever since I started from home. Guess it must be one of your ancient ancestors, Abner, shut up in this critter, by the way it acts.\" \"Where did ye git the thing, anyway?\" Abner enquired. \"Didn\u0027t raise it, did ye?\" \"It\u0027s a Society pig, ye see,\" was the reply. \"I only got it yesterday, an\u0027 sold it at once to Joe Sanders. That\u0027s where I\u0027m takin\u0027 it now.\" \"Must be some class to that animal, Zeb. Society pig, eh? I s\u0027pose it has all the marks of high life?\" \"It ought to have. It was riz by the Agricultural Society, and they generally turn out good stuff. But this darn critter is certainly an exception by the way it acts.\" \"Why don\u0027t ye try Social Service methods on it, then?\" \"Social Service methods!\" Zeb exclaimed in surprise. \"Sure. Reform the thing; elevate it, of course.\" \"Elevate the devil!\" was the disgusted retort. \"That\u0027s what Social Service is fer, though; to elevate the divil, accordin\u0027 to what Jess has been tellin\u0027 me.\" \"But, de ye think ye could elevate a pig?\" Zeb savagely asked. \"Don\u0027t know. Never tried, except to elevate it by the hind legs after it was killed. But Social Service might work wonders with it, though. As it is a Society pig, it\u0027s had a good start, so the rest should be easy.\" \"Ump!\" Zeb snorted. \"All the Social Service methods in the world couldn\u0027t do more than elevate a pig into a hog.\" \"Ho, ho, I guess ye\u0027r right, Zeb. G\u0027long, Jerry.\" Abner emitted several chuckles as they moved leisurely along the road. Once he turned and looked back just as Zeb was endeavoring to balance the box again upon his shoulder. \"Ho, ho,\" he laughed, \"Zeb hit it that time, all right. Ye surely can\u0027t change a pig into anythin\u0027 but a hog, even though it is society bred.\" \"Wasn\u0027t it funny, though?\" Jess commented. \"What; the pig?\" \"Oh, no. But what Zeb said, and the way he looked. Is he as much interested as ever in the Lost Tribes?\" \"Sure. Why, he yangs about it every time we meet. We had a regular set-to one day this week.\" \"But he didn\u0027t say a word about it this morning, daddy.\" \"Neither he did, come to think of it. He had the pig on the brain; that\u0027s why. My, that\u0027s a good one on Lost Tribes, an\u0027 I won\u0027t fergit it next time I see him. To think of Zeb bein\u0027 side-tracked by a pig! Hello! There\u0027s ye\u0027r ma comin\u0027 to meet us, blamed if she ain\u0027t. Guess she got tired waitin\u0027.
