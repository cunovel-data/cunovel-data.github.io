{"id":15616,"no":5,"title":"CHAPTER V","content":"PLAIN FACTS The morning sun struggled through the dust-covered window, and fell aslant the pine board which Zebedee Burns was carefully planing. It was a small workroom, littered with boards, tools, and shavings. Adjoining was the blacksmith shop, for Zebedee was a handy man, and combined carpentering with the smith-trade, besides tending his garden. He was seldom rushed with business, and found time to do extra work, such as trading in \"Society\" pigs. He had just finished planing the board, and was measuring it with his two-foot rule when a form darkened the doorway. \"Mornin\u0027, Zeb,\" was the cheery greeting. \"Mornin\u0027, Abner,\" was the laconic reply. \"Busy, I see. Makin\u0027 a cage fer ye\u0027r society pig, I s\u0027pose,\" Abner bantered, as he sat down upon the tool-chest. Zebedee deigned no reply, but went on with his work. He sawed a few inches off the planed board, laid it carefully aside and picked up another. Abner was surprised at his unusual manner, and studied his face most intently. \"What\u0027s wrong, Zeb?\" he at length enquired. \"Ye look as if ye\u0027d been to a funeral. Haven\u0027t lost one of the Chosen Tribes, have ye?\" \"Quit ye\u0027r foolin\u0027, Abner,\" was the chiding reply. \"I haven\u0027t been to any funeral, though I expect to be at one to-morrow.\" \"Ye do!\" and Abner\u0027s eyes grew suddenly big. \"Who\u0027s dead?\" \"Widder Denton\u0027s little boy.\" \"Whew! Ye don\u0027t tell! Never heard a word about it. When did he die?\" \"Yesterday. I\u0027m makin\u0027 his coffin now.\" \"Ye are, eh? Somewhat out of ye\u0027r line, isn\u0027t it? I thought the undertaker in town allus attended to sich affairs.\" \"He does if there\u0027s any money in it. But this is a different case. Widder Denton\u0027s too poor to buy a casket, so that\u0027s why I\u0027ve tackled the job. Guess there\u0027ll be more to make fer the same family belong long, if I\u0027m not mistaken.\" \"What! Diphtheria?\" \"No; starvation.\" \"Holy smoke! Ye don\u0027t say so! Didn\u0027t know it\u0027s as bad as that.\" \"Well, it is. That poor widder has been workin\u0027 so hard to keep her family that she\u0027s gone under. I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if it\u0027s her coffin I\u0027ll have to make next.\" \"Ye don\u0027t tell! Why, I thought she got money from the company when her husband was killed.\" \"H\u0027m, Lawyer Rackshaw got most of it, accordin\u0027 to what she told me only yesterday.\" \"He did! The skunk! An\u0027 him smokin\u0027 half a dozen ten-cent cigars every day. It\u0027s a wonder she never squealed on him.\" \"Oh, that\u0027s jist like her. She wouldn\u0027t have told me yesterday if I hadn\u0027t pumped it out of her. She\u0027s a game one, all right. But I do pity the poor little kids. I don\u0027t know what\u0027s to become of them.\" \"How many are there?\" \"Five, I guess. The little chap who died was the youngest, an\u0027 he was only three.\" \"My, my!\" Abner sighed, while an expression of sincere sympathy came into his eyes. \"What de ye s\u0027pose kin be done fer \u0027em?\" \"Don\u0027t know, unless we kin git them into that Orphan Home.\" \"What Home?\" Abner asked in surprise. \"Why, you ought to know,\" and Zeb looked up from his work. \"You gave a thousand dollars to it, didn\u0027t ye?\" \"A thousand be hanged! I didn\u0027t give a red cent.\" \"So I thought. Jist hold these boards together, will ye?\" Abner at once obeyed, and after Zeb had driven in two nails, he straightened himself up, and looked at his companion. \"You never intended to give a thousand to that Home, did ye?\" he asked. \"Sure. What de ye think I am? A fool?\" \"Not altogether, but next door to one, I should say.\" \"Ye\u0027ve got a darn lot of gall,\" Abner retorted. \"Ye must have inherited it from one of the Lost Tribes, didn\u0027t ye?\" \"Never mind the Lost Tribes now, Abner. You know what I say is true. You\u0027re no more able to give a thousand dollars to that Home than I am to buy out the whole of Glucom. How in the world de ye expect to git out of the scrape, anyway? Ye\u0027ll be the laughin\u0027-stock of everyone.\" \"Never you mind, Zeb, how I\u0027ll git out of it. I\u0027ll square up all right, so ye needn\u0027t bust any button off about it. I know a wrinkle or two.\" \"Ye\u0027ll have to git a hustle on, then, if them Denton kids are to be helped.\" Abner took three or four steps across the room, and then stopped and looked out of the door. Presently he turned and watched Zebedee for a few seconds. \"How much de ye expect to git fer that job?\" he suddenly asked. \"Jist as much as you\u0027d expect, an\u0027 that\u0027s nuthin\u0027,\" was the quick reply. Abner\u0027s right hand was now in his trousers pocket, firmly gripping the ten dollar bill which had been given to him by the agent. Then he drew it forth, and flung it upon the work-bench. \"Take that, Zeb, an\u0027 give it to Widder Denton,\" he ordered. \"It\u0027s been burnin\u0027 me pocket until me skin is scorched. There, don\u0027t ask me where I got it,\" he added, as Zeb started to speak. \"I\u0027ve got enough lies scratched down aginst me already. But I do feel like havin\u0027 a good fight.\" \"Fight! What de ye want to fight fer?\" Zeb asked in astonishment. \"\u0027Cause I\u0027m ugly, that\u0027s why. The sight of that ten-spot makes me want to hit somebody.\" \"Well, ye\u0027d better git out of this if that\u0027s the way ye feel. I\u0027ve no inclination or time to fight to-day.\" \"An\u0027 ye don\u0027t want a scrap over the Ten Lost Tribes? I\u0027ve given ye plenty of chances. Now, look, Zeb, who was the great-great-great-grandfather of the man who lost the Ten Tribes in the first place? Kin ye tell me that?\" Such a question in the past had always stirred Zebedee to his inmost depths. But now, instead of launching forth in defence of his pet theory, he leaned against the work-bench, folded his arms, and faced his visitor. \"Abner,\" he began, \"I\u0027ve been thinkin\u0027.\" \"Well, that\u0027s encouragin\u0027,\" was the reply. \"A bit out of the ordinary, eh? I thought there was somethin\u0027 wrong with ye.\" \"Yes, I\u0027ve been thinkin\u0027,\" Zeb repeated, \"an\u0027 if you\u0027d do the same occasionally, Abner, it might do ye a world of good.\" \"H\u0027m, ye needn\u0027t judge all ye\u0027r neighbors\u0027 pigs by ye\u0027r own,\" was the retort. \"I\u0027m not, Abner. I\u0027m only judgin\u0027 by solid facts. Now, see here. You an\u0027 me have been makin\u0027 fools of ourselves by always squabblin\u0027 over things of little real value. I yanged about the Lost Tribes, an\u0027 you yanged about how many lives you\u0027ve lived.\" \"They\u0027re mighty interestin\u0027, though,\" Abner remarked. \"I know they are, an\u0027 there\u0027s no harm in discussin\u0027 them once in a while. But it don\u0027t seem altogether right fer two men like you an\u0027 me to spend so much time over sich things, an\u0027 pay little or no heed to what takes place right under our noses.\" \"Guess there\u0027s not much that escapes us, Zeb, is there?\" \"What about that Denton family, then?\" \"But we thought they was well fixed.\" \"Did we ever think much about them, anyway, Abner?\" \"Guess ye\u0027r right, Zeb. We didn\u0027t.\" \"We certainly didn\u0027t, an\u0027 that\u0027s what\u0027s worrin\u0027 me. Why, when I looked at that poor little dead boy last night, an\u0027 talked to the widder, an\u0027 saw the pinched faces of her children, I felt small enough to crawl through a knot-hole.\" \"Sure, ye did,\" Abner agreed. \"I\u0027ve felt that way meself, \u0027specially when Tildy was after me. It\u0027s a mighty creepy feelin\u0027, isn\u0027t it?\" \"Indeed it is, an\u0027 more so when ye\u0027r conscience is lashin\u0027 ye like a thousand divils. I had a hard time to git to sleep last night, fer the picture of the Great Judgment riz right up before me. I heard the Lord a-sayin\u0027, \u0027Zeb Burns, them Denton kids was hungry an\u0027 ye gave them nuthin\u0027 to eat; they was thirsty an\u0027 ye never gave them any fresh milk; they was almost naked an\u0027 ye didn\u0027t give them any clothes. If ye had done them things that little Denton boy wouldn\u0027t have died.\u0027 That\u0027s what I thought He said, an\u0027 when I went to sleep I dreamed that I was bein\u0027 sent to the left hand right into hell fire. It gave me sich a scare that I jumped out of bed with a yell, an\u0027 my wife thought I was crazy. I tell ye it was an awful experience.\" Zebedee pulled out a big red handkerchief, and mopped his brow. \"My! I git all het up when I think of it,\" he panted. Abner made no immediate reply, but stood very still with his eyes fixed intently upon the floor. \"Guess I\u0027ll go now,\" he at length announced. \"What are ye workin\u0027 at these days?\" Zeb asked. \"Pertaters; an\u0027 a mighty pesky job it is. Full of weeds.\" \"Why, I thought ye had them all done.\" \"So I would if it hadn\u0027t been fer house-cleanin\u0027.\" \"House-cleanin\u0027!\" \"Sure. House so spick an\u0027 span that I kin hardly step or set anywheres, so I generally roost on the wood-box. Well, s\u0027long. I must be off.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1683/49573.html","bookId":1171,"book":{"id":1171,"title":"The Touch of Abner","description":"简介： These words drawled slowly forth produced an immediate effect, and caused fifty people to straighten suddenly up and look enquiringly around.
