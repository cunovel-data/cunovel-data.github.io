The men talked as they ate, and there was none of their usual bantering, for the subject of conversation was a serious one. Abner was worried about his trial, which he knew would not be postponed much longer. He was also troubled over the extra mouths he had to feed, and he unburdened his mind to his companion. He laid aside his mask of light-heartedness and indifference, and the expression upon his face touched his neighbor\u0027s heart. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m really hard up, Zeb,\" he explained, \"an\u0027 I don\u0027t know where the next barrel of flour is to come from. This place doesn\u0027t raise much, as ye know, an\u0027 what little I had saved up from sellin\u0027 the Flyin\u0027 Scud went fer Jess\u0027 eddication at the Seminary. If I turn them kids away, what is to become of \u0027em? An\u0027, besides, I\u0027ll be the laffln\u0027-stock of all the fools in the country. Then, there is that trial. How in the world am I goin\u0027 to pay a lawyer? Why, it\u0027ll take my place.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Abner\u0027s head was bowed as he finished, and he sat bent over the table. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Come, come, man, don\u0027t git too down-hearted,\" Zeb encouraged, rising from the table. \"Ye\u0027r not ready fer the Poor House yit. Let\u0027s go out under the shade of that big tree at the back of the house an\u0027 have a smoke.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Abner rose and pulled out his pipe. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I must git that hay in, Zeb,\" he remarked. \"It\u0027s been out too long already. I turned it out of cock this mornin\u0027, an\u0027 it\u0027s in fine condition now.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, I guess it won\u0027t hurt fer another hour, Abner. A smoke is allus good after dinner before ye go to work. Come on.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n For half an hour they sat in the cool shade of the tree, and when at last Zeb went home Abner was feeling much better and more like himself. He harnessed Jerry, and was just hitching him to the waggon when an auto stopped before the house. A young man alighted, and walked at once into the yard. Abner recognized him as the surveyor he had threatened to shoot some time before, and he wondered what he could want now. \\n\\n \\n\\n But Thane Royden seemed to have forgotten all about that incident, for he shook Abner heartily by the hand, and enquired after the family. When he learned that they were all on the island he was much disappointed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That is too bad,\" he remarked. \"I\u0027m leaving town in a few days and wish to say good-bye.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Abner now remembered that it was this young man who had driven Jess home from the party, and surmised that it was she he was most anxious to see. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is there any way I can get over there?\" Royden asked, as he looked off toward the island. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I s\u0027pose ye could swim,\" Abner replied, \"but that wouldn\u0027t be very comfortable. If ye wait till I git that hay in I\u0027ll run ye over in the canoe. I\u0027m to have supper with them, ye see. I would take ye in my little yacht, but she\u0027s layin\u0027 above the Pint, an\u0027 it \u0027ud take too long to bring her around.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That will be fine,\" the surveyor replied. \"Let me help with the hay, and we can soon get through.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Did ye ever pitch hay?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I was brought up on a farm, and should know something about it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sure, ye ought. Come on. There\u0027s a fork leanin\u0027 aginst the barn. Ye kin pitch on, if ye don\u0027t mind.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Abner liked this young man, and the skilful manner in which he worked won his heartiest approval. They became very friendly and talked as they worked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"So ye\u0027r goin\u0027 to leave, are ye?\" Abner at length queried. \"All through with ye\u0027r work, eh?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m through with the Government, or rather they\u0027re through with me,\" was the reply. \"They\u0027ve fired me because I spoke my mind very plainly. They wanted me to do dirty work, and when I refused they gave me the G.B.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They did? Well, that\u0027s too bad,\" was Abner\u0027s comment, as he stowed away a forkful of hay which had just been handed up. \"Where are ye goin\u0027?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have accepted a good offer with the Morton \u0026 Griffin Cement Company, and will begin work with them in a few weeks. It is a far better position, for I shall not have to bother about grafters there. It is a big reliable concern, with fine opportunities for advancement.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"An\u0027 so they expected ye to do dirty work, did they?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes. You have no idea what they wanted me to do. Even in my report of your place here they asked me to say that the gravel was of little value for ballast.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"An\u0027 did ye?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Certainly not. I told them that it is the best I have ever seen, and so far as I could tell there is almost an unlimited supply.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Good fer you, young man. I shan\u0027t fergit that. Jist fasten up that check-rein, will ye? Jerry\u0027ll have all the hay eaten up if we\u0027re not keerful.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Have they been after you yet?\" Royden asked, when they had moved to another bunch of hay. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, yes, they\u0027ve been after me, all right,\" and Abner laughed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But you haven\u0027t sold?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not on ye\u0027r life.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s good. Don\u0027t let them have anything unless they pay you well.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But they say they will \u0027spropriate, whatever that means.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, they have the power. But they\u0027ll not be anxious to do that. There are several in the game. They hope to buy the place from you for a mere song, and then turn it over to the Government for a big figure. Oh, I know their tricks. They\u0027ve done it before in other ways, such as buying horses and cattle.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But how kin I git me price?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sit tight, and when necessary go after them with hammer and tongs. Don\u0027t be afraid of them, and stand your ground.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The load was now all on, and Abner had just picked up the reins when a young man was seen walking toward them from the house. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s Billy Lansing,\" Royden exclaimed in disgust. \"What in the world does the fellow want?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Who\u0027s Billy Lansing?\" Abner asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, you ought to know, Mr. Andrews. He\u0027s the one who bribed you to put him next to your boss, isn\u0027t he?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He is! Well, I\u0027ll be jiggered! I\u0027ve never seen him since.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Neither has he seen you, though he\u0027s told that story very often, so I hear.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He has, eh? An\u0027 did anyone put him wise?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not that I know of. He\u0027s not liked in town, so people let him tell the story and then laughed at him behind his back. He thinks yet that you\u0027re the hired man, so I believe.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Say, s\u0027pose we let him think so?\" Abner suggested in a low voice, for Billy was now quite near. \"You jist call me Bob, an\u0027 we\u0027ll have some fun.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Royden agreed and turned toward Billy. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hello, you here!\" the latter accosted. \"Didn\u0027t know you had turned farmer. Where are the girls?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What girls?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, the ones we met at the party, of course.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I guess you\u0027ll have to ask Bob,\" and Royden motioned to Abner. He had to turn his face away to keep from laughing. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Say, old top, de ye know where they are?\" Billy questioned. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hey, what\u0027s that?\" Abner asked as if he had not heard. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Are the girls around? They\u0027re not in the house.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Want to see the gals, eh? What gals?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Your boss\u0027 daughter and that other one. My, she\u0027s a peach!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, ye mean Jess an\u0027 Belle. Well, they was around this mornin\u0027, all right, but now I reckon they\u0027re anchored over on the island.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The devil! Say, is there any way I can get over?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Got any more ten-spots in ye\u0027r pocket?\" Abner asked. \"I\u0027ll take ye over if ye have.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Billy looked at him in a quizzical manner. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Say, you haven\u0027t earned the money I gave you some time ago,\" he reminded. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What money?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t ye remember? The ten-spot to put me next to the old man.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh yes, I do recollect that ye shoved somethin\u0027 into me hand. Well, that money\u0027s gone to feed the hungry, an\u0027 clothe the naked. It\u0027s been put to good use.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But it hasn\u0027t done what it was intended to do though. It was to put me next to your boss, so\u0027s I could sell him a car.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There\u0027s lots of time yit to git next to the old feller, so don\u0027t worry.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But he\u0027s in jail and likely to be sent further, from all accounts.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, he\u0027s in a pretty bad mess,\" Abner agreed. \"But, there, I must git this hay in. Gid-dap, Jerry.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hold on a minute,\" Billy ordered. \"And you won\u0027t take me to the island?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t say I wouldn\u0027t, did I?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, but you wanted ten dollars, though.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, well, I\u0027ll cut it out if you can\u0027t afford to pay that much. I\u0027m goin\u0027 over, anyway, when I git through with this hay, an\u0027 if ye\u0027ll give us a hand I\u0027ll take ye along.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sure, I\u0027ll help you,\" was the ready response. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Did ye ever do any hayin\u0027?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Never did. But there\u0027s nothing to learn about it, is there? Just tell me what to do.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ye kin mow away. Scoot along an\u0027 climb up that ladder, an\u0027 stow away fer all ye\u0027r worth.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Abner chuckled to himself as he headed Jerry for the barn. \"I was goin\u0027 to put this in the empty bay,\" he mused, \"but since I\u0027ve these two love-sick fellers here I might as well finish that other mow. It ought to hold another load or two with close packin\u0027. Guess Billy\u0027ll find it\u0027s the hottest place he was ever in. Stiddy, there, Jerry.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n With a rush the horse surged the load into the barn, and at once Abner picked up his fork and started to work. Royden was in his place to receive the hay as it was handed up. He understood the work, and found it easy to toss it back to Billy. To the latter, however, it was something new, and the heat of the loft was oppressive. The perspiration poured down his face, and at times he felt that he would smother, as he struggled with the hay, stowing it into every corner, and tramping it down. When at length the hay was unloaded and he climbed down the ladder he was a pitiable sight to behold. His eyes were wild and bloodshot, his face a fiery hue, and steaming wet, while his immaculate clothes were clinging to his body as if he had been plunged into the river. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Fer heaven\u0027s sake! What\u0027s the matter with ye?\" Abner asked, as Billy dropped into the bottom of the waggon. \\n\\n \\n\\n The only reply of the exhausted man was a series of moans, as he lay there panting and gasping for breath. Abner backed the horse and waggon out of the barn, and when the cool air fanned Billy\u0027s face he began to revive. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Good Lord!\" he ejaculated. \"It\u0027s hell up there!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Thought it was down below, eh?\" Abner queried. \"Guess hell ain\u0027t located in any special place. Ye\u0027ll find it most anywhere, even in a hay-mow.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But what did you put me in a hole like that for?\" Billy angrily demanded. \"You knew what it was like, didn\u0027t you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, I gave ye the easiest job, young man,\" Abner replied. \"If ye don\u0027t like that, ye kin load or pitch on whichever ye prefer. It\u0027s all the same to me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"To hell with it all. I\u0027m done with haying. I feel sick, anyway.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Look here,\" Abner warned, \"ye\u0027ll feel a darn sight sicker than ye do at present if ye don\u0027t stop ye\u0027r swearin\u0027.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What\u0027s that you say? How dare you speak to me an that way? I\u0027ll tell your boss on you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Tell all ye like. But, there, I\u0027ve lost enough time with ye already, so trot along.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But Billy did not leave. He followed the team about the field for a few minutes, silent and sulky. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027ll take me to the island, won\u0027t you?\" he at length pleaded. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sure, I\u0027ll take ye, if ye\u0027ll hold ye\u0027r tongue an\u0027 wait till we git this hay in. Ye\u0027d better go over and set down under that big shady tree. A nap\u0027s good fer babies in the afternoon.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Lansing made no reply, but did as Abner had indicated. He sprawled out upon the ground, and spent his time smoking cigarettes. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I wish Billy would go home,\" Royden remarked, as he tossed up a forkful of hay. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"H\u0027m, that\u0027s not his way, seems to me,\" Abner replied. \"He\u0027s lookin\u0027 fer the soft spots in life, like too many fellers. He feels more at home layin\u0027 there under that tree than standin\u0027 up. But he got a dose up in that mow, though.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n When at last the hay was all in and Jerry stabled, Billy was on hand, ready to go to the island. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Feel better now?\" Abner asked as they walked to the shore. \"Sickness all gone, eh?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sure, I\u0027m tip-top,\" was the reply. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Subject to faintin\u0027 spells, are ye?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve had them ever since I was a child.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Specially when there\u0027s work to be done. Ye\u0027r not alone in that. Hop in now,\" he ordered, when the canoe had been launched. \\n\\n \\n\\n Abner paddled, while Royden sat in the bottom of the canoe. Billy persisted in sitting well up on the bow, notwithstanding Abner\u0027s warning. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ye might tumble off there,\" he told him. \"This is not a scow nor an ocean liner ye\u0027r in now, but a cranky canoe, an\u0027 ye kin never tell what might happen.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"De ye think I\u0027m a kid?\" Billy indignantly asked. \"I\u0027m all right here. You get a hustle on, and never mind me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Abner made no reply, though a peculiar expression appeared in his eyes. He paddled with long steady strokes, and looked straight ahead. It was a beautiful day, and only a gentle ripple ruffled the surface of the river. It took but a few minutes to cross the channel, and then they were in shallow water in the midst of eel-grass, broad water-lily leaves, snags and half-sunken logs. \\n\\n \\n\\n Billy was deliberately smoking a cigarette, with an air of bored indifference. Suddenly the canoe struck a partly submerged root, which tilted it dangerously to the right. The force of the impact sent Billy backwards, and with a yell of fright he plunged headlong into the water. He was up again in an instant, spluttering and trying to disentangle himself from the eel-grass, which was entwined about his face and neck. The canoe by now was several yards away, and as Billy endeavored to walk, he not only sank ankle deep in the soft, yielding mud, but several times he stumbled and almost fell over a sunken log or root. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hello, what are ye doin\u0027 out there?\" Abner asked in apparent surprise. \"Fishin\u0027 fer clams? There ain\u0027t none there.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"D—n you,\" was the angry reply. \"You know what I\u0027m doing. It was all your fault. You struck that log on purpose.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What log? Did we strike a log?\" and Abner appealed to Royden. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t see any,\" was the laughing reply. \"But Billy says we did, and he evidently knows from the look of things.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n By this time the unfortunate man had struggled to the side of the canoe. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Be keerful, now, how ye board this craft,\" Abner warned. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve a good mind to dump you both into the water,\" was the retort. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Try it on, young man, if ye want to stay down in that mud till ye stop bubblin\u0027.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n With considerable difficulty Lansing was helped on board, and once more the canoe sped forward. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Look at my clothes,\" Billy whined. \"What a mess they are in!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, they\u0027ll soon dry out,\" Abner comforted. \"When ye git ashore ye kin jist set in the sun, an\u0027 them duds\u0027ll he dry in no time. Then ye kin roll over a log, an\u0027 they\u0027ll he ironed an\u0027 ye\u0027r pants creased quicker an\u0027 better than they could at any landry.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But this mud won\u0027t come off, though,\" and Billy mournfully viewed several big daubs on his white trousers. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not if ye rub it. Jist let it dry, an\u0027 then it\u0027ll brush off without hardly a stain. It\u0027s somethin\u0027 like scandal, mud is. Rub it when it\u0027s wet, an\u0027, Lord, it makes an awful mess! But jist leave it alone fer a while, an\u0027 it\u0027ll disappear, an\u0027 ye\u0027ll scarcely know it was there. That\u0027s what old Parson Shaw uster say, an\u0027 it\u0027s true, fer I\u0027ve tried it. But here we are at the island.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1683/49590.html","bookId":1171,"book":{"id":1171,"title":"The Touch of Abner","description":"简介： These words drawled slowly forth produced an immediate effect, and caused fifty people to straighten suddenly up and look enquiringly around.
