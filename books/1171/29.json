{"id":15640,"no":29,"title":"CHAPTER XXIX","content":"COUNSEL FOR THE DEFENSE \n \n It was a great story Abner had to tell that night at supper. The boys, who always ate early, were playing out in the yard, and the sound of their laughter drifted in through the open window. Abner told nothing about what he had demanded of the three men, but merely of the fright he had given them. \n \n \"Ye should\u0027ve seen their faces,\" he chuckled. \"They thought fer sure that I was goin\u0027 to swamp \u0027em in them white-caps. My, how they begged me to go back!\" \n \n \"It was a shameful thing to do,\" Mrs. Andrews declared. \"They will never forgive you, and they are government members at that.\" \n \n But Belle did not consider it in that light. She was highly amused, and her eyes danced with merriment. \n \n \"Don\u0027t you worry, Mrs. Andrews,\" she said. \"It will take more than that before those men get all that\u0027s coming to them. I know who they are from Mr. Andrews\u0027 description, for daddy has often told me about them. They have been a great worry to him for years, and I can imagine how he will laugh when I tell him how they were frightened. Daddy doesn\u0027t approve of such schemes, for I have often heard him say so.\" \n \n A new feeling pervaded the house since Sunday night. Mrs. Andrews and Jess were more at ease after they had heard that notable sermon. They even felt proud of Abner, and were sorry that they had wrongfully misjudged him. They were doing their best now to make up for their past mistake, and this Abner noted. \n \n But notwithstanding the changed atmosphere in the home Abner was visibly worried. The trial was but two days off, and he looked forward to it with considerable anxiety. He confided his trouble to Zeb as the latter was working at his bench the next afternoon. \n \n \"I\u0027m beginnin\u0027 to feel shaky,\" he confessed. \"I don\u0027t know nuthin\u0027 about court proceedin\u0027s, an\u0027 that\u0027s where that cur of a Rackshaw\u0027ll have the dead cinch on me.\" \n \n \"Look to ye\u0027r special ancestors, Abner,\" Zeb bantered, as he paused in the act of measuring a board. \"Ye\u0027ve got so many that ye ought to be able to find a clever lawyer among \u0027em.\" \n \n \"H\u0027m,\" Abner grunted, \"I\u0027m afraid they won\u0027t help me much at the trial. They\u0027re too spiritual, ye see, an\u0027 they wouldn\u0027t make any impression upon him. It needs somethin\u0027 like rats, fer instance, to have any effect upon that brute.\" \n \n \"It\u0027s a pity ye didn\u0027t git a smart lawyer, Abner. I\u0027d like to see Rackshaw butt up aginst someone more\u0027n his equal. That feller needs to be brought down a peg, an\u0027 made to squirm a bit. But I\u0027m afraid there\u0027s not much chance of you doin\u0027 that.\" \n \n \"I know it, Zeb,\" Abner agreed, \"an\u0027 that\u0027s what\u0027s worryin\u0027 me. It\u0027s not of meself I\u0027m thinking but of them dependin\u0027 on me.\" \n \n This feeling of depression increased as Abner and Zeb drove into town the next day. The latter was going to stand by his neighbor, and do what he could to help him by his presence, if in no other way. The morning was hot, and Jerry jogged leisurely along. The men were in no hurry, as court did not open until ten o\u0027clock. \n \n For some time neither mentioned the big event of the day. Each hesitated to express his views, for there was no brightness to the cloud hanging dark and lowering. \n \n \"It takes good nerves to stand a trial,\" Abner at length declared. \n \n \"Y\u0027bet it does,\" was the emphatic reply. \"An\u0027 a big purse, too, let me tell ye that. It\u0027s easy to git into trouble, but mighty hard to git out.\" \n \n \"Like them rats in that wire-trap, eh? But it should make a difference when a man has justice on his side.\" \n \n \"Seems to me, Abner, that justice depends upon the way ye look at it,\" Zeb replied. \"Joe Preston thinks that his cause is just, an\u0027 so d\u0027you. But it doesn\u0027t matter what you or Joe thinks. It\u0027s how the judge an\u0027 the jury will look at it. An\u0027 that depends upon——\" \n \n Zeb paused and looked thoughtfully at the horse. \n \n \"Upon what?\" Abner anxiously enquired. \n \n \"Upon the way the case is presented. Now, you know a hull lot, Abner, an\u0027 kin spout like a force-pump when ye\u0027re settin\u0027 with me in the workshop. But when ye git up there in court ye\u0027ll find ye\u0027r tongue\u0027s tied in a double-an\u0027-twisted knot.\" \n \n \"Sure, sure,\" Abner agreed. \"I\u0027ve had the feelin\u0027 before, \u0027specially when I proposed to Tildy. I lost me tongue altogether that time. It was awful.\" \n \n \"Well, I\u0027m afraid it\u0027ll be awfuller when ye\u0027r called upon to defend ye\u0027rself. Now, if ye had a smart lawyer to do it fer ye it \u0027ud make a great difference. I s\u0027pose ye\u0027r family felt pretty bad when ye left this mornin\u0027?\" \n \n \"Tildy an\u0027 Jess did, but Belle was as chipper as a sparrow. She didn\u0027t feel one bit put out, an\u0027 gave me strict instructions to give it to Rackshaw good an\u0027 hard.\" \n \n \"She doesn\u0027t understand, mebbe, what ye\u0027r up aginst Abner. Ye see, she\u0027s never had to hustle fer herself or fight her way in the world. But ye\u0027r wife an\u0027 Jess know somethin\u0027 about sich things.\" \n \n \"But Belle is no fool nor giddy headed butterfly let me tell ye that,\" Abner defended. \"She\u0027s got a mighty long head on young shoulders, an\u0027 if she didn\u0027t feel bad about the trial I believe it is because she has sich confidence in me. She somehow thinks that I\u0027m all right. She\u0027s surely some gal, that, an\u0027 we\u0027ll miss her when she goes home.\" \n \n The court room was already well filled when Abner and Zeb arrived. The trial was of special interest, for people, knowing something of the defendant\u0027s peculiarities, expected lively and interesting scenes. Isaac Dimock and Henry Whittles were there. They could not afford to lose the opportunity of seeing the defeat of their enemy, especially when Rackshaw got after him. They were sitting together, and they smiled and whispered as the two countrymen entered the room. The lawyer was seated at a small table with his client by his side. He was in excellent spirits, smiling and talking with Preston as Abner and Zeb appeared. He was joyfully anticipating his onset upon the man who had so grossly insulted him. He would get more than even for that rat-affair. He looked with satisfaction upon the witnesses lined upon the witness bench, and knew that they would give \"proper\" evidence. They all had been carefully prepared, as he had seen to that. Everything had been thoroughly arranged, and he could not detect a hitch anywhere. He was anxious now for the judge and jury to arrive that the case might begin. Abner sat alone on one end of the witness seat. He felt more dejected than ever as he glanced at the witnesses who were to testify against him. He observed the eager, triumphant expression upon Rackshaw\u0027s face, and it angered him. He knew that he had not the slightest chance against the forces opposed to him. It made him surly and indifferent, and he was in a most dangerous mood by the time the court opened. \n \n Rackshaw began the case, and in eloquent language described every detail of the assault. He referred to the serious bodily damage which had been inflicted upon his client, who had been in the hospital ever since, and was still very weak from the rough handling he had received. He spoke for over half an hour, and closed by stating what a menace to the community the defendant was. He was more than a fool, so he declared; he was a vicious character, and unless stringent measures were taken against him there was no telling what he might do in the future. \n \n Rackshaw\u0027s words made a deep impression upon the jury and on all who were in the room, excepting Zeb Burns and a few others. It was quite evident what the verdict would be, for there was no one present able to stand up against the lawyer. \n \n Abner had followed Rackshaw\u0027s speech with the keenest attention. As each point was emphasized, he tried to turn over in his mind what he could say in self-defense. But he became hopelessly confused, and when the lawyer was through he knew that it was impossible and futile to try to make any reply. He sat there upon the bench with the eyes of all fixed upon him. The people were now expecting considerable fun, for all were aware of Abner\u0027s sharp tongue and marked eccentricities. To see him and listen to his words had drawn many to the court room that morning. But Abner was in no mood for anything of a humorous nature. The situation was too critical, and he felt that the less said the better it would be for him. He would let the rest do the talking and make the next move. \n \n For a few minutes an intense silence prevailed, all wondering what would happen next. Rackshaw was smiling in a most tantalizing manner, and Preston, too, was amused. The members of the jury also smiled as they watched the pathetic figure of the farmer sitting before them. It would be an easy task for them to arrive at a true decision, so they believed. \n \n As the judge was about to speak, a slight commotion took place near the door, and two men pushed their way through the crowd, and walked swiftly up the aisle. The instant Rackshaw saw them, the triumphant expression fled from his face, and his eyes bulged with apprehension. He grasped in a twinkling the meaning of their presence. \n \n \"Good Lord!\" he gasped, turning to Preston, \"it\u0027s Rivers, the Attorney General, and he\u0027s got Stevens with him!\" \n \n Abner saw the strangers, but they meant nothing to him. He liked the looks of the man who was bowing to the judge and apologizing for his tardiness, owing to the lateness of the train. He was tall and straight, with a noble head crowned with a wealth of hair, thickly streaked with gray. He had a strong face, a manner dignified and imperious, and eyes which never wavered, but pierced, so his opponents were forced to acknowledge, like lightning. \n \n All this Abner noted, and he knew that here was a man of considerable importance, not only by his appearance but by the deference paid him by the judge. His presence was explained in a few minutes, and not only Abner but the entire assembly were completely astonished. \n \n \"I have made a great effort to be here this morning,\" the speaker announced. \"It was only lately that I heard of this trial. Had it come to my attention sooner I should have taken immediate steps to have the case settled before it came into court. Even now it may not be too late. I wish to state that I am here this morning on behalf of the defendant, Mr. Abner Andrews, of Ash Point. I am acquainted with all the details of the case, and shall do my best for the defendant. In this I shall be ably assisted by Mr. Stevens, who has accompanied me. You are all familiar, I am sure, with his reputation as a lawyer.\" \n \n Abner only partly understood the meaning of these words. He was dazed and confused. He knew that the man had come to his assistance, but who he was and why he should defend him was beyond his comprehension. \n \n But Rackshaw knew, and the knowledge filled him with a burning anger, mingled with an intense fear. It was the Attorney General\u0027s daughter who was at the bottom of all this, he was certain. She was visiting the Andrews, and for her sake her father had taken this most unusual and unheard-of step. He knew Rivers of old, and realized how utterly useless it would be to oppose such a man. He feared, too, the able lawyer who had accompanied him. The two would form opponents in any court of which any lawyer might have just reason to dread. \n \n Added to this was the knowledge of the influence Rivers wielded in the Government of the province. As Attorney General his power was great, and both Rackshaw and Preston knew that it would be to their advantage to come to some terms of agreement as speedily as possible. They were both in line for political favors, and it would be necessary for them to move as cautiously as possible. \n \n \"There is something else I wish to say,\" Rivers continued, and he turned his particular attention to Preston. \"If the plaintiff is determined to press this case, and is unwilling to make a settlement out of court, I shall at once, on behalf of the defendant, bring in a charge of libel. All here, I believe, are well acquainted with the article which recently appeared in The Live Wire, of which the plaintiff is the editor. It made a most serious and uncalled-for statement concerning the defendant\u0027s wife, and which was the direct cause of all this trouble. I should regret to take this step, but shall be forced to do so unless matters are otherwise arranged.\" \n \n Rackshaw and Preston were now in a difficult and most unenviable position. They had entirely overlooked this phase of the case, and it brought consternation into their hearts. They could easily perceive that the people in the room were greatly excited and were watching the next move with the keenest interest. To go forward meant no end of difficulties with such stern opponents to face. Retreat, as Rackshaw knew, was the better part of valor, and his only problem now was how to retreat as gracefully as possible. He had to act, and act quickly, for all were watching him with impatient curiosity. His triumphant, tantalizing manner had entirely vanished, and as he rose to his feet his body trembled, and his face became unusually pale. His statements were broken and he stammered as he proceeded, to the great amusement of the spectators. \n \n \"My client here is willing to discuss this matter out of court,\" he announced. \"His cause is just, and he has every reason to press the case. But as the Attorney General has taken the trouble to interest himself in this little affair, it would be most unbecoming on our part not to comply with his request before going further. If a peaceful settlement can be agreed upon it will perhaps be better for all concerned.\" \n \n Abner was never able to give a clear account of what happened immediately after the court adjourned. He was conscious of a great commotion in the room, and of the Attorney General grasping him by the hand and asking about Belle. He also heard him say that he was coming to Ash Point the next day, and would be there in time for tea. Just what he said in reply Abner was not altogether sure. He stammered something about Belle being well, and that they would all be glad to see him. But his brain was so confused that he could not think clearly until he was out of the building and walking along the street with Zeb by his side. The fresh air revived him, his spirits returned, and he emitted a hearty chuckle. \n \n \"My, I\u0027m glad ye\u0027r comin\u0027 to,\" Zeb laconically remarked. \"Thought I\u0027d have to call fer the doctor.\" \n \n \"Oh, I\u0027m all right now, Zeb,\" was the reply. \"But, say, the air of that room was bad. It was worse than the jail, blamed if it wasn\u0027t. I never imagined that Rackshaw could foul up a place in sich a short time. Guess all of his evil spirits must have been hoverin\u0027 around him pretty lively, from all appearances.\" \n \n \"An\u0027 they must have been hoverin\u0027 over you, too, Abner, by the way ye looked an\u0027 acted.\" \n \n \"Sure, sure. Why, I never felt so mixed up since the day old Parson Shaw hitched up me an\u0027 Tildy. I was completely gone then, an\u0027 don\u0027t know to this day what I said.\" \n \n \"Bad spirits, eh?\" and Zeb\u0027s eyes twinkled. \n \n \"Bad? Ugh! Ask Tildy, Zeb. She knows where I got the stuff.\" \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1683/49597.html","bookId":1171,"book":{"id":1171,"title":"The Touch of Abner","description":"简介： These words drawled slowly forth produced an immediate effect, and caused fifty people to straighten suddenly up and look enquiringly around.
