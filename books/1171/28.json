{"id":15639,"no":28,"title":"CHAPTER XXVIII","content":"THE HOLD-UP There was great discussion over the sermon preached at St. Felix Sunday night. Several people were very angry at the outspoken words, among whom was Henry Whittles. He made haste to see Lawyer Rackshaw, and poured out to him his troubles, and how he had been grossly insulted. \"It serves you right,\" was the unsympathetic reply he received. \"If you will insist upon going to church you must not complain at what is handed out to you. I\u0027ve cut loose from all such superstitious and sentimental gush, and I advise you to do the same.\" \"I intend to do so while that idiot is there,\" Whittles declared. \"And to think that Abner Andrews was at church, too.\" \"He was!\" and the lawyer looked his astonishment. \"Yes; and his family as well. Miss Rivers, the Attorney General\u0027s daughter, was with them, too, so I believe. Abner will have something to chuckle over now, all right.\" \"Let him chuckle, Hen. He won\u0027t do it long. Just wait till that trial comes off.\" \"When is that?\" \"Pretty soon now. He\u0027ll chuckle on the other side of his face.\" \"But Parker upheld Abner in what he did. He said that any man who was not a coward would have done the same if Joe Preston had written such an article about his wife. In fact, he confessed that he would have done so himself if he had been in Abner\u0027s place.\" \"He said that, did he?\" \"He certainly did, and if I\u0027m not much mistaken his words will have a strong influence. It will be necessary for you to be on your guard.\" Rackshaw made no reply, but sat and gazed thoughtfully out of the office window. In truth he sat there for some time after Whittles had left, and he seemed in no hurry to go on with his business. The Live Wire made a great deal of the sermon, and scored Mr. Parker for going beyond bounds. It was the duty of a clergyman to preach the Gospel, so the paper piously announced, and to leave civic matters alone. It also hinted that a clergyman was very short-sighted who antagonized members of his flock, who were liberal supporters of his church. Mr. Parker had done this, and accordingly must expect to put up with the results. The real vital matter of a suitable Home for orphans was not mentioned, and no credit was given the Andrews for what they had done. This oversight was noted by many readers and severely criticized. In fact, the editorial did a great deal for Abner, far more than the writer imagined. It made thinking people realize how partisan and narrow it really was, and that the welfare of the community was not its main object. This was brought out, too, in the accounts it gave of the coming election. The men it advocated were known to be unscrupulous grafters, who had carried on wholesale robbery for several years in connection with various government deals. A long description was given of a great political picnic, which was to be held that afternoon in the Parish of Granton on the opposite side of the river from Ash Point. The members of the county would be present, and there would also be several noted speakers. All were urged to attend, and to hear the \"truth, and nothing but the truth.\" Zeb Burns read these articles to Abner as they sat after dinner under the shade of a big maple tree near the workshop. \"Seems to me that paper\u0027s tryin\u0027 to knife that parson as well as me,\" Abner remarked, as he blew a cloud of smoke into the air. \"An\u0027 I guess it\u0027ll meet with about as much success,\" Zeb replied. \"I wish I\u0027d heard that sermon last night, Abner. It must have been a corker.\" \"It sure was, an\u0027 I never thought once of goin\u0027 to sleep. But ye should have seen Hen Whittles\u0027 face an\u0027 ears. Why, they was as red as the reddest beet I ever saw. Say, there goes the Bluebird, and he motioned to a steamer out upon the river. Wonder why she\u0027s up so early to-day.\" \"Fer the picnic, of course,\" Zeb explained. \"She\u0027s black with people. They\u0027ve come fer the peanuts, kill-at-first-taste cigars, lemonade, an\u0027 hot air. There\u0027s to be some great speeches over there this afternoon. How\u0027d ye like to run across in ye\u0027r yacht, Abner? Ye haven\u0027t had her out fer a long time.\" \"That\u0027s true. I\u0027ve been too busy ashore. But I wouldn\u0027t go to that picnic fer a good deal. I don\u0027t want me morals spiled. All the gas-bags in the province couldn\u0027t change me, \u0027specially them fellers who are to speak this afternoon.\" \"They\u0027ll be after ye to vote fer \u0027em, though.\" \"Not on ye\u0027r life. They think I\u0027m luney an\u0027 too hard to talk to. Ho, ho, wasn\u0027t it funny the way they looked when they learned that we wasn\u0027t deaf after all?\" \"Mebbe they\u0027ll hear about that sermon, an\u0027 they might change their minds.\" \"Sure, sure, ye kin never tell what people\u0027ll do. It\u0027s made a great difference at my house, anyway.\" \"It has? In what way?\" \"Oh, I can\u0027t jist explain. But Tildy isn\u0027t nigh so cranky, an\u0027 Jess looks very happy. It may be that young feller who comes to see her, though I don\u0027t believe that\u0027s the full reason. They was all mighty sot up the way that parson stood up fer me last night.\" \"But how did he know so much about ye, Abner?\" \"Blamed if I know. That\u0027s been puzzlin\u0027 me a great deal. Where he got all that information, an\u0027 had my mind turned inside out is more \u0027n I kin understand. Why, I never spoke to that feller in my life an\u0027 he seems to know me like a book.\" Scarcely had Abner finished speaking when an auto swung up the road at a fast clip. It was about to pass when the chauffeur suddenly pulled up in front of the big maple. There were three men in the car besides the driver, and they were the very ones who had come to buy the gravel hill. They seemed to be in a great hurry. \"Good-day, gentlemen,\" the spokesman, Thomas Dillman, accosted. \"Can you tell us what time the steamer from the city arrives here?\" \"She\u0027s already arrived,\" Abner replied. \"Arrived! But she\u0027s not due here for half an hour yet.\" \"Can\u0027t help that. She\u0027s arrived an\u0027 gone. That\u0027s her smoke \u0027way up there,\" and Abner pointed up the river. Exclamations of consternation burst from the three men at this information, followed by strong denunciatory language. \"What in the devil is the meaning of all this? Dillman demanded, looking fiercely at Abner, as if he were the cause of the trouble. \"Search me,\" was the reply. \"Ye\u0027ll have to go an find out fer ye\u0027rselves. I\u0027m not runnin\u0027 the steamer nor the picnic.\" \"But we must be at that picnic,\" the man insisted. \"It is absolutely necessary for us to be there. We are to speak, and the people will be expecting us. Confound that steamer! I shall certainly make it hot for the company. It has a government subsidy, too, and to think that we should be treated this way! \"That ain\u0027t nuthin\u0027 new,\" Abner explained. \"We\u0027re more\u0027n used to sich capers. That boat never knows her own mind. She comes an\u0027 goes any old time, an\u0027 doesn\u0027t mind one dang bit how people are put out. I\u0027m mighty glad yez have got a good dose to-day.\" \"You are!\" Dillman indignantly retorted. \"You\u0027re a nice one. But this is not getting us over the river. How in blazes are we to get there? That\u0027s the important thing just now. Isn\u0027t there a boat we can hire?\" \"S\u0027pose you run \u0027em over, Abner,\" Zeb suggested. \"Have you a boat?\" Dillman eagerly asked. \"Sure, three of \u0027em. Now, there\u0027s the canoe, the flat-bottomed boat, an\u0027——\" \"Oh, never mind telling us about them,\" Dillman impatiently interrupted. \"Get us there; that\u0027s all we want. We\u0027ll make it worth your while.\" Abner knocked the ashes from his pipe, and rose slowly to his feet. \"Jist wait a minute till I git me oars,\" he told them. \"I guess I kin take yez.\" There was a peculiar light shining in his eyes as he hurried into the house and returned a few minutes later. No one noticed that he had donned his coat, and that it was buttoned about him in a strange manner. Room was made for him in the car, and, telling the chauffeur where to go, in a few minutes they were at the shore on the upper side of the point. A short distance away the Scud was tugging at her anchor, for a stiff breeze was blowing in from the west. The tender was pulled up on the shore. \"Hop in,\" Abner ordered, \"an\u0027 set still, all of yez.\" It took them but a few minutes to board the Scud and get under way. A rude craft was this yacht which Abner had made with his own hands. She was small and her cock-pit was barely large enough to hold the three men. Here they crowded together and looked ruefully around. They were not accustomed to the water, and when the wind had filled her sail and the yacht began to careen to one side, they almost wished that they had never come. For a while the Scud glided steadily along, being somewhat sheltered by the point. But when once beyond this the full force of the breeze caught the boat, and the spray began to dash aboard. The three passengers clutched hard at the sides of the cock-pit, and looked anxiously around. \"Is this blooming thing safe?\" one of the men gasped, when a larger spray than usual flung itself over them. \"Sometimes she is an\u0027 sometimes she isn\u0027t,\" was the laconic reply. \"Kin yez swim?\" The three men shook their heads. \"That\u0027s too bad.\" \"Why, what do you mean?\" Dillman asked. \"Do you think she\u0027ll upset?\" \"Can\u0027t say,\" Abner drawled. \"Ye never jist know what queer kinks the Scud\u0027ll take. Only last month she played one of her funny pranks, an\u0027 upsot right near here with a wind no harder\u0027n this.\" \"She did!\" and the men\u0027s faces became suddenly white. \"What did you do?\" one of them anxiously enquired. \"Oh, jist climbed on her bottom until she drifted ashore. That ain\u0027t nuthin\u0027 fer me. I\u0027m used to the water, an\u0027 could swim all day if I had to.\" The man made no reply, but clutched the sides harder than ever as the waves increased. \"Yes,\" Abner continued, \"this is a bad place when the tide\u0027s runnin\u0027 down an\u0027 the wind\u0027s blowin\u0027 up. Two men were drowned right out here a few years ago. They was in a bigger sailin\u0027 boat than this when a sudden squall struck her, an\u0027 she flopped right over. They couldn\u0027t swim, ye see. That\u0027s a bad piece of water ahead where ye see them white-caps. I have me doubts about gittin\u0027 through.\" \"Don\u0027t go through,\" the men begged. \"For God\u0027s sake go back! We\u0027ve had enough of this.\" A gleam of triumph now shone in Abner\u0027s eyes. He gave the tiller a vigorous twist and brought the Scud full head to the wind. \"So yez don\u0027t want to go through, eh?\" he queried. \"No, no. Go back.\" \"Well, I don\u0027t have to go through them white-caps, so what\u0027s ye\u0027r terms if I go round \u0027em?\" \"Terms! What do you mean?\" Dillman gasped. \"Guess you fellers should know, all right. I want a settlement fer me gravel hill. That\u0027s what I mean, an\u0027 I intend to have it now.\" The men understood most clearly the purport of these words, and their hearts became hot with anger. They realized the helplessness of their position, and how they were at the mercy of this man. \"You\u0027re a villain!\" Dillman roared. \"Do you think it\u0027s fair to get us into a tight corner and then hold us up like this?\" \"De ye like it?\" Abner asked with a chuckle. \"How does it feel? Ye know now, don\u0027t ye? Ye\u0027r tryin\u0027 to do the same with me, an\u0027 ye\u0027r jist waitin\u0027 the first chance to steal me place. But, by jiminy, ye\u0027ll not do it as soon as ye think, not by a jugful, skiddy-me-shins if ye will. I\u0027ve got yez here, an\u0027 here I\u0027ll keep yez till ye come to me terms.\" \"Good gracious, man!\" Dillman exploded, \"we can\u0027t do anything here. Wait until we get ashore and we\u0027ll talk this matter over with you.\" \"Not by a long chalk. Jist write out that ye\u0027ll give me fifteen thousand dollars fer that place, an\u0027 I\u0027ll land yez at the picnic grounds in no time. But yez better hurry up, fer the Scud\u0027s drifting fast toward them white-caps. Guess, though, I kin hold her nose up stiddy ferninst the wind a few minutes longer.\" Dillman looked at the rough water, and then at the imperious commander. \"If this boat overturns,\" he at length remarked, \"you\u0027ll go down, too, for you can\u0027t surely swim in a place like this.\" Abner laughed, and threw open his coat. \"Look,\" he cried. \"I\u0027ve got a life-belt on. I never come here on a windy day without it.\" The three men were now completely stumped and they looked imploringly around. But no help was in sight. A short distance away the water was raging where the wind and the tide were contending with each other. \"Hurry up,\" Abner ordered, \"the Scud\u0027ll soon take them white-caps full astern, an\u0027 then good-bye.\" Dillman\u0027s hand clawed at a note-book and fountain-pen in his vest pocket. He hesitated, however, and looked at his companions. \"Go ahead, Tom,\" they advised, \"there\u0027s nothing else to do.\" But Tom delayed, leaned over and whispered something to his comrades in distress. Abner could not hear what was said, though he noticed that they nodded their heads in approval. \"Say, we\u0027ll offer you five thousand,\" Dillman at once announced. \"Fifteen thousand or nuthin\u0027,\" was the peremptory order. \"You government fellers think nuthin\u0027 of throwin\u0027 that much around, an\u0027 a darned sight more, when it suits yez. I might as well have what\u0027s due me. Hurry up. Ye\u0027ve got no time to waste.\" With trembling hand Dillman put his pen to the paper, and rapidly wrote. \"How will that do?\" he presently asked, handing the paper to Abner. \"Read it,\" was the order. \"Me eyes are not good, an\u0027 it\u0027s all I kin do to handle the boat.\" \"\u0027On behalf of the local government,\u0027\" Dillman read, \"\u0027we agree to give Abner Andrews fifteen thousand dollars for his place at Ash Point.\u0027\" \"That\u0027s good,\" was Abner\u0027s comment. \"Now, sign it, the three of yez.\" This was soon done, and in a few seconds the paper was placed in Abner\u0027s hand. The three men anxiously watched to see whether their captor would look at it, and they breathed more freely when he thrust it at once into his pocket without even a glance in its direction. Abner at once threw over the tiller and the Scud swung around. Her sail filled, and she darted forward as if glad of her release. The wind had now increased, but the yacht, running dead before it, bore herself bravely. On and on they sped until at length the big picnic tent near the shore could be seen showing white amid its setting of verdant grass and waving trees. Ere long they could discern people moving about, and as they drew near the shore they could see that it was lined with people who had hurried down to watch the superior movements of the little craft, reeling onward, at times half smothered by the leaping waves. With his passengers landed, Abner at once headed for home. He wondered why the politicians were so affable and had bidden him such a cheery good-bye. They did not seem one bit angry, and he saw them laughing and talking with one another as he sped away. \"Let \u0027em laff,\" he mused, \"I\u0027ve got the paper,\" and he thrust his hand into his pocket to be sure it was safe. \"They can\u0027t fool Abner Andrews, of Ash Pint, not by a jugful, skiddy-me-shins if they kin.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1683/49596.html","bookId":1171,"book":{"id":1171,"title":"The Touch of Abner","description":"简介： These words drawled slowly forth produced an immediate effect, and caused fifty people to straighten suddenly up and look enquiringly around.
