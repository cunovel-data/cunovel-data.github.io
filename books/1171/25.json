{"id":15636,"no":25,"title":"CHAPTER XXV","content":"LAFFIN\u0027-GAS \"Hello, Lost Tribes!\" Abner accosted. \"What\u0027s the matter? Not sick, are ye?\" \"Do I look sick?\" Zebedee asked, as he took his pipe from his mouth, and glared at his neighbor. \"Well, I can\u0027t altogether say that ye have the appearance of dyin\u0027,\" Abner replied, as he sat down by Zeb\u0027s side on the workshop steps. \"But ye don\u0027t look as spry as a skippin\u0027 lamb, an\u0027 ye\u0027r face ain\u0027t as bright as a shiny mug. What\u0027s wrong?\" \"Nuthin\u0027.\" \"H\u0027m, so that\u0027s it, eh? It\u0027s no wonder ye look glum. Nuthin\u0027 wrong! Everythin\u0027 runnin\u0027 as smooth as molasses in summer time. That\u0027s sartinly too bad. Nuthin wrong! What\u0027s the nuthin\u0027, Zeb?\" \"You,\" was the unexpected reply. \"Me!\" Abner exclaimed in astonishment. \"Sure. You\u0027re the nuthin\u0027, an\u0027 it\u0027s you that\u0027s wrong.\" \"Thanks fer the compliment, Zeb. \u0027Tisn\u0027t every day I git handed one so free an\u0027 easy like. What\u0027s started ye? Wife cranky, or is it indigestion ye\u0027ve got?\" Zebedee did not deign to reply for a few minutes, but pulled steadily at his pipe, and gazed out over the fields. \"Say, Abner,\" he at length began, \"what\u0027s the meanin\u0027 of ye\u0027r actions, anyway?\" \"Actions! What actions?\" \"Why, you ought to know. How many customers de ye expect to have?\" \"Customers!\" \"Sure. Haven\u0027t ye started store-keepin\u0027? Didn\u0027t I see a big truck at ye\u0027r back door last night, loaded with enough goods to keep a lumber camp fer a month?\" \"Oh, I see,\" and Abner\u0027s eyes twinkled with amusement as light began to dawn upon his mind. \"Why shouldn\u0027t I start store-keepin\u0027?\" \"Why? Simply because ye would ruin ye\u0027rself in a few weeks.\" \"I would, eh?\" \"Certainly. Where would ye git the customers, I\u0027d like to know?\" \"They\u0027d flock from all parts, of course. Half of Glucom \u0027ud be here in no time.\" \"H\u0027m,\" Zeb sniffed in disgust. \"Ye\u0027r mistaken there, Abner. It wouldn\u0027t work.\" \"What\u0027ll ye bet?\" \"I won\u0027t bet. It wouldn\u0027t be fair.\" \"That\u0027s not it, Zeb. Ye wouldn\u0027t dare to bet, fer ye know ye\u0027d lose.\" \"Quit ye\u0027r foolin\u0027, Abner, an\u0027 let\u0027s git down to business. Are ye goin\u0027 crazy, man, to start store-keepin\u0027 in a place like this? Ye can\u0027t afford to do sich a thing. If ye have any money to throw away ye\u0027d better keep it fer that trial of yours.\" \"But I need money, Zeb, an\u0027 if I can\u0027t git it one way I\u0027ll have to try another.\" \"Well, leave store-keepin\u0027 alone.\" \"I intend to.\" \"Ye do?\" \"Sure. Never thought of it till ye put the notion into me head. It might be a good scheme, though.\" \"Well, what\u0027s all that stuff at your place fer, then?\" \"Oh, that\u0027s a gift. Belle\u0027s dad sent it fer the kids.\" \"He did!\" Zeb\u0027s eyes opened wide in amazement. Abner smiled. He was enjoying himself immensely now. \"It shook ye\u0027r timbers, did it?\" he queried. \"Thought I was goin\u0027 store-keepin\u0027. No, I don\u0027t intend to start that at present. I\u0027ve somethin\u0027 else on me mind.\" \"Ye have? Some more fool-nonsense, I s\u0027pose.\" \"No, this is the real thing, first class an\u0027 up to date. I\u0027m goin\u0027 to make money hand-over-fist. Listen to this.\" Fumbling in his vest pocket, Abner brought forth a newspaper clipping and unfolded it with great care. \"I cut it from The Family Herald an\u0027 Weekly Star,\" he explained. \"Read it last night, an\u0027 I\u0027ve been laffin\u0027 ever since. Say, it\u0027s a great idea, an\u0027 struck me all at once, like that ram did Tom Bentley. Ye ought to read The Herald, Zeb. It tells ye most everything an\u0027 what it doesn\u0027t tell isn\u0027t worth knowin\u0027.\" \"Well, fer pity sakes what is it, Abner?\" \"Oh, haven\u0027t I told ye? Why, I thought I had. Here it is, then. It tells about an old feller who lived thousands of years ago, though I can\u0027t make out his name. It\u0027s a funny one, an\u0027 I never heard of that ancestor of mine before. Kin ye give it the right twist, Zeb?\" \"Spell it, Abner. My eyes ain\u0027t good, an\u0027 me glasses are in the house.\" \"It\u0027s the darndest word I ever sot me eyes on. It goes this way: D-i-o, now that spells Dio. The next is g-e-n; that\u0027s gen, all right. The last two letters are e-s, and the hull bunch put together gives us D-i-o-g-e-n-e-s, Dio-genes. Ain\u0027t that a whopper, though? I dare say Jess knows the hang of it, but blamed if I do.\" \"Tut, man, I\u0027ve heard of that feller before. It\u0027s pronounced Diogenes,\" Zeb explained. \"Ye\u0027r not so smart after all, are ye, even though ye do read The Family Herald. But what are ye drivin\u0027 at, Abner?\" \"He\u0027s one of me ancestors, ye see, an\u0027 it\u0027s nice to know the hang of his name. It\u0027s a great one, isn\u0027t it? Diogenes! Gee! that sounds high class.\" \"Ancestors be hanged! What good are sich ancient critters, I\u0027d like to know?\" \"Look here, Zeb,\" and Abner looked thoughtfully at his neighbor. \"Haven\u0027t I been inspired by me ancestors all me life? First the warlike ones overshaddered me, an\u0027 then the peaceful spirits hovered round. Now, ain\u0027t that so?\" \"Wouldn\u0027t be surprised at anythin\u0027,\" Zeb agreed. \"Ye seem to have sich a dang lot of ancestors that I don\u0027t know which ones ye\u0027r goin\u0027 to follow next.\" \"I sartinly have, Zeb. That\u0027s the time ye hit the nail on the head. I try out one bunch, an\u0027 when I git tired of them I shift to another. That\u0027s why I\u0027m keen on that old feller, what\u0027s his name?\" \"Diogenes?\" \"Yes, that\u0027s him, though I guess you\u0027d better do the pronouncin\u0027. It doesn\u0027t seem to come handy to me, nohow. Well, I\u0027m much interested in that old feller I\u0027ve been laffin\u0027, as I told ye, ever since I read that piece in The Family Herald.\" \"What did he do that was so funny, Abner?\" \"Do! He set the hull world laffin\u0027 to split its sides, that\u0027s what he did.\" \"In what way? Fer pity sakes, git on with ye\u0027r yarn.\" \"Yes, he sartinly did funny things. He lived in a tub, jist think of that. How would you like to have a tub fer a house, Zeb? Wouldn\u0027t it be great! There\u0027d be no house-cleanin\u0027 days, an\u0027 no carpets to beat, an\u0027 sich unnecessary things to attend to.\" \"What did he do in the tub?\" Zeb inquired, now becoming much interested. \"What did he clo? Why, he made the hull world laff, of course. Wasn\u0027t that enough?\" \"But how did he do it, Abner? I don\u0027t see anythin\u0027 so funny about that. Anybody could set in a tub, couldn\u0027t they?\" \"Sure. But, ye see, that old feller lived in the tub, ate his meals in it, an\u0027 slept there. When folks came to see him he showed \u0027em his house, kitchen, dinin\u0027-room, parlor an\u0027 bedroom, all in one. After they was shown around, so to speak, they nearly all died laffin\u0027. Ye see, they thought he was luney. Then when they stopped laffin\u0027 long enough, he up an\u0027 says, \u0027Now jist look at all the things I do not need. It doesn\u0027t take much to keep a man goin\u0027, does it?\u0027 That\u0027s what he says.\" \"I s\u0027pose they thought he was crazy, Abner?\" \"Not a bit of it after that. They had more sense. They called him a philosopher, or some sich name, an they all flocked to see him an\u0027 to hear his wisdom.\" \"They did!\" \"Sure. They came in crowds, an\u0027 though they laffed an\u0027 laffed at the queer old feller, they paid attention to what he said. Even the king came to see him.\" \"Ye don\u0027t tell!\" \"Yes, Alexander the Great, they called him. He came too, an\u0027 he asked the old feller if he could do anythin\u0027 fer him. An\u0027 what de ye s\u0027pose me ancient ancestor said?\" \"I couldn\u0027t guess.\" \"Sure, ye couldn\u0027t, an\u0027 no one else. Now, you or me, Zeb, would have asked fer a hull lot of things if the King of England came by an\u0027 wanted to do somethin\u0027 fer us. We would ask him fer some soft government persition, wouldn\u0027t we?\" \"Most likely we would.\" \"But that old feller didn\u0027t ask fer no sich things. He looked at the king, squinted his eyes a little, an\u0027 says he, \u0027Yes, Alec, ye kin do me a great favor.\u0027\" \"\u0027An\u0027 what is it?\u0027 says the king, soft an\u0027 pleasant like, expectin\u0027 to be asked fer somethin\u0027 great.\" \"\u0027Ye kin jist stand from between me an\u0027 th\u0027 sun,\u0027 says the old feller. \u0027Ye\u0027r hidin\u0027 the light, an\u0027 I feel chilly.\u0027 That\u0027s what he says to the king.\" \"And wasn\u0027t the king hoppin\u0027 mad?\" Zeb asked. \"Mad! Not a bit of it. He grinned, an\u0027 went away. I bet ye\u0027r boots he told his wife about it, an\u0027 they both had a good laff, the first they\u0027d had, I reckon, fer a long time. Ye see, it did \u0027em good. That\u0027s what they needed to cheer \u0027em up. An\u0027 look here, Zeb, that\u0027s what people need to-day. If they\u0027d laff more they\u0027d feel a darned sight better, let me tell ye that. You\u0027d feel better ye\u0027rself, Zeb.\" \"I feel better, already, Abner,\" was the reply. \"I\u0027m jist holdin\u0027 me sides to keep from splittin\u0027, ye\u0027r story was so funny.\" \"H\u0027m, I guess if ye saw an\u0027 heard me when I was real funny ye\u0027d be tied up in a knot in no time. If the spirits of me humorous ancestors got busy there\u0027d be somethin\u0027 doin\u0027 worth while. An\u0027 they\u0027re really needed. It \u0027ud do people a world of good if they could be affected jist fer a day by them wonderful spirits.\" \"What are ye talkin\u0027 about, anyway, Abner? What could the spirits of ye\u0027r ancestors do?\" \"Do? Why, they could cure all kinds of diseases, an make people well an\u0027 strong.\" \"Fiddlesticks! Ye\u0027r talkin\u0027 nonsense, Abner. How could they do sich things?\" \"With laffin\u0027-gas, that\u0027s how.\" \"Laffin\u0027-gas?\" \"Sure. Ye see, people don\u0027t laff enough. They go round with faces as long as Miss Julie Tomkins\u0027 tongue an\u0027 that\u0027s some length, skiddy-me-shins if it ain\u0027t. Most of the folks ye meet now-a-days look as if they was about dyin\u0027, or had lost their best friends. They need to be stimulated by a good laff once in a while. It \u0027ud help their digesters an\u0027 make life more pleasant.\" \"An\u0027 so ye think ye\u0027r ancestors could make people laff, do ye?\" Zeb enquired. \"Sartin! They\u0027ll work through me, an\u0027 I feel \u0027em gittin\u0027 busy jist now. They\u0027ve given me the power, an\u0027 I\u0027m ready to try it upon anybody. Anythin\u0027 wrong with you, Zeb? Tooth-ache, stummick-ache, heart-ache, boils, or any dang thing ye might mention. I\u0027m a specialist on all.\" \"Good Lord, no!\" Zeb exclaimed. \"I know enough of ye\u0027r spirit-movin\u0027 business, Abner. Try it on someone else, but I warn ye to leave me alone unless ye want an ache that all ye\u0027r spirits combined couldn\u0027t cure.\" \"There now, don\u0027t git cranky an\u0027 sassy, Zeb. It was only fer ye\u0027r welfare that I offered me services. But if ye won\u0027t accept \u0027em then I\u0027ll have to try it on others.\" \"An\u0027 de ye think people would come to be treated by you?\" \"Why not? They want to be cured, don\u0027t they?\" \"I s\u0027pose they do, most of \u0027em at any rate. But they prefer to go to someone who knows what he\u0027s talkin\u0027 about.\" \"An\u0027 de ye think I don\u0027t know? De ye imagine I\u0027m jist spoutin\u0027 to hear meself?\" \"I wouldn\u0027t like to say that, Abner. But people wouldn\u0027t come to you. They\u0027d laff at you an\u0027 call ye a fool.\" \"Let \u0027em call me whatever they like, Zeb. But they\u0027d laff, an\u0027 that\u0027s jist what they need, as I told ye.\" \"H\u0027m, I don\u0027t doubt about their laffin\u0027, providin\u0027 they\u0027d come. They couldn\u0027t help splittin\u0027 their sides when they looked at ye.\" \"An\u0027 so ye think they wouldn\u0027t come, eh?\" \"I\u0027m certain they wouldn\u0027t.\" \"What\u0027ll ye bet?\" \"Well, I wouldn\u0027t bet much with you, Abner, fer ye couldn\u0027t stand to lose anythin\u0027.\" \"But I\u0027ll not lose. Now see here, I\u0027ll bet ye a fig of terbaccer; how\u0027ll that do?\" \"I\u0027ll take ye, Abner.\" \"That\u0027s right, Zeb, fer I\u0027m hard up fer a plug of terbaccer at this present minute. I\u0027ll borrow a little on account, if ye don\u0027t mind. Me pipe\u0027s gone out.\" \"How de ye plan to start?\" Zeb asked, as he handed over a part of a fig of T. \u0026 B. \"I\u0027m thinkin\u0027 of puttin\u0027 an ad. in The Live Wire,\" Abner replied, as he thoughtfully whittled off several liberal slices of tobacco. \"Wish ye\u0027d write it out fer me, Zeb. Ye\u0027r good at sich things. Ye often write ads. about ye\u0027r \u0027Society\u0027 pigs, don\u0027t ye?\" Zeb pulled a note-book and pencil from his vest pocket and told his companion to go ahead. \"Go ahead ye\u0027rself,\" Abner ordered. \"Jist say that I\u0027m a specialist on diseases, an\u0027 will treat anyone wot comes to me next Saturday evenin\u0027 after supper. That\u0027s the grain an\u0027 you know how to grind it up.\" After much thought and head scratching Zeb managed to write out an advertisement which he thought would do. Then he read it aloud: DISEASE SPECIALIST \"Abner Andrews, of Ash Point, has a new remedy for all kinds of diseases. For the sum of twenty-five cents he will treat all who come to him. Office Hours, Saturday afternoon, from 6 o\u0027clock to midnight.\" \"There, how does that suit ye?\" Zeb asked, when he had finished reading. \"It\u0027s a master-piece, all right,\" Abner replied. \"But haven\u0027t ye made the fee rather low?\" \"Guess it\u0027s enough fer the first time. If ye find ye\u0027r rushed ye kin put up the price.\" \"Sure. Anyway, I\u0027ll make up in numbers, all right. Better have that terbaccer ready, Zeb, for I\u0027ll want it to soothe me nerves when I git through with the gang.\" \"Seems to me ye\u0027r partly paid already, Abner. Ye\u0027ve pocketed the plug I jist let ye have.\" \"Well, I declare! Good job ye reminded me, Zeb,\" and Abner chuckled as he handed back his neighbor\u0027s property. \"I feel so sure of winnin\u0027 the bet that I thought I owned that plug. Now ye mention office hours in that ad. Where am I to git an office?\" \"In ye\u0027r own house, of course. That\u0027s the right place.\" \"H\u0027m, I s\u0027pose it is. But, ye see, I\u0027m afraid Tildy an\u0027 the gals might object to havin\u0027 a crowd around. Let me have this place, will ye, Zeb?\" \"My workshop!\" \"Sure. Ye kin sweep it up a bit, an\u0027 it\u0027ll do fine. Ye won\u0027t be usin\u0027 it Saturday night, will ye?\" \"Seems to me, Abner, ye\u0027r gittin\u0027 me too much into this affair. I don\u0027t want people to think that I\u0027ve lost me senses, even if you have. But ye\u0027r welcome to the place fer all the good it\u0027ll do ye.\" \"Thank ye, Zeb. An\u0027 ye\u0027ll be sure an\u0027 send that ad. to The Wire, won\u0027t ye? I\u0027m hard up fer cash jist now. I\u0027ll pay ye out of what I make. We\u0027ll be pardners, ye see.\" Zeb looked at his neighbor in astonishment. \"Well, if you haven\u0027t enough gall to start a vinegar factory then I\u0027ll be jiggered,\" he exclaimed. \"Pardners, eh? An\u0027 I\u0027m to run the hull durned shootin\u0027-match!\" \"Don\u0027t worry, Zeb,\" Abner replied, as he rase to his feet. \"I\u0027ll do all the shootin\u0027 that\u0027s necessary. But, there, I must git home to dinner. Then I\u0027ll have to look after me laffin\u0027-gas. S\u0027long, Zeb, an\u0027 don\u0027t fergit that ad. Ten cents a line, remember, an\u0027 twenty cents fer a header.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1683/49593.html","bookId":1171,"book":{"id":1171,"title":"The Touch of Abner","description":"简介： These words drawled slowly forth produced an immediate effect, and caused fifty people to straighten suddenly up and look enquiringly around.
