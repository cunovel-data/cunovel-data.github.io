{"id":15628,"no":17,"title":"CHAPTER XVII","content":"FRIENDLY ADVICE \n \n It seemed to Abner that all his friends had forsaken him. He paced up and down the room outside his cell most of the evening. The chauffeur was asleep, and his deep breathing was the only sound which broke the intense stillness which prevailed. The nap he had taken that afternoon drove all sleep from Abner\u0027s eyes. In fact, he could not have slept, anyway, as the story the chauffeur had told gave him food for much thought. So Rackshaw was at the bottom of it all, he mused. He had surmised as much, but he had no means of proving it until he had heard it from the lips of the wild-eyed youth. Perhaps the lawyer was responsible, too, for the article in The Live Wire. How could the editor have obtained the information unless someone had communicated with him? The police, of course, could have done so, but they would not have twisted the story beyond all semblance of reality. He felt that Joe Preston was guilty, and deserved all that he had received. But was Rackshaw in league with him? \n \n He was lost in such thoughts when he heard the jailor\u0027s approaching footsteps. The man was coming, no doubt, to lock him in his cell for the night. The thought of being confined in that narrow stuffy place for long hours angered him, so when he heard the key rattle in the lock he was in a most dangerous frame of mind. Accustomed as he was from childhood to unbounded freedom, and an abundance of fresh air, this close confinement in such poorly-ventilated quarters was most galling. He had started to walk back to the other end of the room as the key turned in the lock. He could hardly trust himself then, and he needed a few seconds to calm his feelings. \n \n As the door swung open the jailor called to him, and demanded why he was running away. Fiercely Abner wheeled around, but the words of wrath which were glowing hot on his tongue suddenly cooled when he beheld Zeb Burns standing before him. For an instant he stood as if he had seen an apparition, staring hard at his neighbor. Zeb saw the look of astonishment, and the faint semblance of a smile lurked about the corners of his mouth. \n \n \"What\u0027s the matter, Abner?\" he asked. \"Ye look scared.\" \n \n \"So I am.\" \n \n \"What about?\" \n \n \"You.\" \n \n \"Me! Why are you scared about me?\" \n \n \"What have ye been doin\u0027, Zeb?\" \n \n \"Doin\u0027! What de ye mean?\" \n \n \"But why are ye here? Have they got you, too?\" \n \n \"Ho, ho, I see,\" and Burns laughed outright. \"Ye think that because you\u0027re in the Klink everybody else is headin\u0027 the same way. But I guess there are a few sensible people left yit in the world, which is a mighty lucky thing.\" \n \n \"An\u0027 they\u0027re not goin\u0027 to lock you up too?\" Abner asked in surprise. \"Ye haven\u0027t been beatin\u0027 anybody up, eh?\" \n \n \"Certainly not. What\u0027s the matter with ye, anyway, Abner? I\u0027m here to take you out of this hole, so git a hustle on an\u0027 come with me at once. There now, never mind talkin\u0027,\" he added. \"We\u0027ve got lots of time fer that later. I want to git away.\" \n \n Like a child Abner followed Zeb out of the jail, and not until they had reached the street did he open his lips. Then he stopped, looked around, and drew in a long, deep breath of fresh air. \n \n \"My, that feels good!\" he exclaimed. \"The Lord never meant a man to be shut up in a place like that.\" \n \n \"I know he didn\u0027t,\" Zeb replied. \"Neither did He intend that a man in his common sense should act the fool.\" \n \n \"De ye think I have?\" Abner demanded. \n \n \"It looks very much like it. But, let\u0027s hurry up. I guess the judge will settle whether you are a fool or a lunatic, so it\u0027s no use fer us to spend our time arguin\u0027 about it.\" \n \n \"Where are ye goin\u0027?\" Abner asked. \n \n \"Home, of course. Where else would we go?\" \n \n \"Did ye walk to town, Zeb?\" \n \n \"Sure; I\u0027ve no other means of conveyance, have I?\" \n \n \"An\u0027 ye\u0027re goin\u0027 to walk home?\" \n \n \"Guess so from present appearance.\" \n \n \"But Jerry\u0027s here,\" Abner explained. \"Sam must know where he is.\" \n \n \"That\u0027s good. We\u0027ll hustle there at once an\u0027 git the old nag.\" \n \n They moved rapidly along the street leading to the railway station. This route led them by Rackshaw\u0027s office, and as they were about to pass they glanced in at the open door. The sight which met their eyes filled them with astonishment, causing them to stop and look into the room. To Zeb the scene of chaos was puzzling, but Abner surmised the cause in an instant. His face brightened, and his mouth expanded into a grin when he saw Whittles upon the floor and the lawyer standing before the box. \n \n \"Evenin\u0027, gentlemen,\" he accosted, \"an\u0027 may the Lord fergive me fer miscallin\u0027 yez. Havin\u0027 a pink tea, eh?\" \n \n Rackshaw stood staring at Abner as if he could not believe his eyes. \n \n \"Good Lord!\" he ejaculated. \"Are you that devil, Andrews, or his ghost? I thought you were in jail.\" \n \n \"H\u0027m,\" Abner sniffed. \"I\u0027m St. Peter now. This is me angel in the shape of Zeb Burns, who came to-night an\u0027 brought me out of prison. Look\u0027s to me as if you an\u0027 Hen have been holdin\u0027 a prayer meetin\u0027. Guess ye\u0027r prayers must have been answered, fer here I be.\" \n \n \"You\u0027re no saint,\" Rackshaw roared. \"You\u0027re Beelzebub, the prince of devils; that\u0027s who you are. What did you mean by sending me those rats?\" \n \n \"Rats!\" and again Abner grinned. \"Oh, I see,\" and his eyes surveyed the room. \"Country rats, eh?\" \n \n \"Indeed, they were,\" was the emphatic reply. \"And look what they\u0027ve done to my office. You\u0027ll have a nice sum to pay for all this damage.\" \n \n \"Me! Me pay?\" \n \n \"Yes, you I mean!\" the lawyer yelled, now fairly beside himself. \"You are the cause of all this, an\u0027 I\u0027ll skin you alive, see if I don\u0027t, you miserable devil.\" \n \n The grin vanished from Abner\u0027s face, his form suddenly straightened, and his eyes blazed. Walking slowly across the room, he stood before the angry lawyer. \n \n \"Jist say them words agin,\" he warned, in that drawling tone which betokened danger. \"If ye\u0027re thinkin\u0027 of skinnin\u0027 me alive, as no doubt ye\u0027ll try to do, I might as well have my full satisfaction now. I\u0027m in deep water as it is over Joe Preston, an\u0027 I feel jist in the mood to have another scalp scored to my credit. Another skunk like you won\u0027t make much difference, so jist say them words agin, will ye?\" \n \n Rackshaw was in a trap and knew it. His body shook and his eyes blazed fire. But he was an arrant coward, and the huge form bulked very large before him just then. He knew that Abner would not hesitate to deal with him as he had with Joe Preston, and he did not relish the thought of going to the hospital for repairs. As the two men thus faced each other, Zeb approached and laid a firm hand upon Abner\u0027s arm. \n \n \"Come along out of this,\" he commanded. \"You\u0027re in enough trouble now. Don\u0027t be a fool. I\u0027m losin\u0027 faith in this ancestor business of yours. St. Peter never acted like you\u0027re actin\u0027 to-night.\" \n \n For an instant only Abner hesitated. He did long to give the lawyer something that was coming to him. But he knew that Zeb was right, and he followed him to the door. He couldn\u0027t refrain, however, from giving a parting shot ere he left. \n \n \"Don\u0027t fergit, Rackshaw,\" he reminded, \"that country rats are not to be fooled with, no matter whether they walk on four legs or two. Keep ye\u0027r city rats where they belong, and let them mind their own bizn\u0027ess, an\u0027 ye\u0027ll have no trouble with country rats.\" \n \n \"Fer heaven\u0027s sake, hold ye\u0027r tongue, an\u0027 come along,\" Zeb ordered. \"I\u0027m sick an\u0027 tired of all this confounded fuss.\" \n \n \"But would ye put up with sass from a thing like that?\" Abner asked. \"I wish I had punched his head.\" \n \n \"It\u0027s lucky ye didn\u0027t.\" \n \n \"Why?\" \n \n \"You ought to know as well as I do. What kin you do aginst a lawyer? He\u0027ll make it hot fer you as it is. I don\u0027t know what\u0027s comin\u0027 over ye, Abner. I always knew that you were a queer critter, but I thought ye had some brains left.\" \n \n For a wonder Abner made no reply, but walked along silently until the station house was reached. It was locked, and Sam was nowhere to be found. Upon enquiry from a man who was standing upon the platform, they learned that the agent had gone to a party out in the country, and had taken Jerry with him. \n \n \"Confound that feller!\" Abner growled. \"What right has he to run off with my hoss, I\u0027d like to know?\" \n \n \"He looked after him, though, when you were in the pen, didn\u0027t he?\" Zeb queried. \n \n \"Sure, sure he did, an\u0027 I s\u0027pose I must fergive him.\" \n \n \"Now you\u0027re beginnin\u0027 to talk like a reasonable man, Abner. It\u0027s the first sensible thing I\u0027ve heard ye say to-night. But we\u0027ve got to git home, so I guess there\u0027s nothin\u0027 else to do but to foot it. What de ye say?\" \n \n \"I\u0027m game, so let\u0027s git on.\" \n \n They made their way through the town, and when they were at last out into the country, they filled and lighted their pipes as they trudged along. So far little had been said, but the soothing effect of the tobacco seemed to make them more communicable, and they discussed the affairs of the evening. Abner was unusually fierce in his denunciation of everything in general. He believed that he had been unjustly treated, and he longed for suitable retaliation. Zeb listened to him for some time without arguing. He knew that Abner must unburden his soul before he could feel better. At length, however, he stopped and laid his hand upon his companion\u0027s sleeve. \n \n \"Look here, Abner,\" he solemnly began, \"I don\u0027t like ye to talk that way. It doesn\u0027t do any good.\" \n \n \"But it does me a lot of good to blow off steam,\" Abner retorted. \n \n \"Yes, mebbe it does. But remember, there\u0027s a great difference between blowin\u0027 off steam and bustin\u0027 ye\u0027r biler, an\u0027 that\u0027s what you\u0027re in danger of doin\u0027.\" \n \n \"But de ye think I\u0027m goin\u0027 to put up with a hull bunch of rogues who are tryin\u0027 to down me?\" \n \n \"An\u0027 ye\u0027r helpin\u0027 them with ye\u0027r actions, ain\u0027t ye?\" \n \n \"What else am I to do? They\u0027ll walk over me rough shod if I don\u0027t put up a fight. If ye run away from a little snappin\u0027 cur he\u0027ll run after ye, an\u0027 bite ye\u0027r heels, an\u0027 bark like mad. But turn around, face the critter, an\u0027 give it a good kick, an\u0027 then ye\u0027ll see how it\u0027ll scoot away with its tail between its legs.\" \n \n \"But suppose it isn\u0027t a cur, Abner, but a big bulldog, what then?\" \n \n \"Why, I\u0027d use a stick, or mebbe somethin\u0027 else.\" \n \n \"Yes, that\u0027s jist it. You\u0027d do somethin\u0027 that ye\u0027d regret all ye\u0027re life. Now, look here. You\u0027ve got to stop all this. What you need is a change of heart.\" \n \n \"Change of heart!\" Abner repeated. \"Good Lord, what de ye mean by that? Ye haven\u0027t been attendin\u0027 a revival meetin\u0027, have ye, Zeb?\" \n \n \"No, I haven\u0027t, an\u0027 don\u0027t intend to. But common sense tells me that a man won\u0027t accomplish much in this world when he is always rubbin\u0027 people the wrong way. Even a cat won\u0027t stand it fer long.\" \n \n \"The way I rubbed Rackshaw, Ikey Dimock an\u0027 Joe Preston, eh?\" Abner asked. \n \n \"That\u0027s what I mean. It makes the sparks fly, an\u0027 soon there\u0027s a big fire which is hard to put out.\" \n \n \"What de ye expect me to do, then?\" \n \n \"Rub people the other way, fer instance, and see how it\u0027ll work.\" \n \n \"Ho, ho,\" and Abner laughed outright. \"Imagine me rubbin\u0027 Ikey Dimock an\u0027 Rackshaw, an\u0027 pattin\u0027 \u0027em on the back an\u0027 callin\u0027 \u0027em \u0027me dear friends.\u0027 No, I guess I\u0027m too old a bird fer that. Never had the trainin\u0027, ye see. Anyway, it\u0027s no use now; it\u0027s too late. Everybody\u0027s dead set aginst me, an\u0027 is tryin\u0027 to do me.\" \n \n \"Everybody is not, Abner. I\u0027m not, anyway, or else I wouldn\u0027t have taken all the trouble to walk to town to git ye out of jail.\" \n \n \"Sure, sure, I know you\u0027d stand by me, Zeb. But, say, how did ye do it?\" \n \n \"Do what?\" \n \n \"Git me out of jail, of course.\" \n \n \"Oh, bailed ye out, that was all.\" \n \n \"But where did ye git the money?\" \n \n \"Never mind where I got it. That\u0027s my own business, so don\u0027t say anythin\u0027 more about it.\" \n \n Abner was silent for a few minutes as he plodded along. \n \n \"Say,\" he presently began, \"does Tildy an\u0027 the gals know about this?\" \n \n \"Can\u0027t say fer sure,\" was the reply. \"But I don\u0027t believe they do. I jist heard of it by chance, but I never said a word to ye\u0027r folks.\" \n \n \"That\u0027s good of ye, Zeb.\" And once more Abner became silent. \n \n The night was dark, and when the men were about a mile from their homes it began to rain, first a gentle drizzle, then a steady downpour. They hastened their steps, but the roads became muddy and slippery, which made progress slow. \n \n \"Say, Zeb,\" Abner at length panted, \"an\u0027 ye really think I need a change of heart?\" \n \n \"Don\u0027t ye think so ye\u0027rself?\" was the evasive reply. \"Is this rain softenin\u0027 ye up? It is me, at any rate, an\u0027 I\u0027m gittin\u0027 soaked.\" \n \n \"But how kin I begin the change, Zeb?\" \n \n \"Guess ye\u0027ll have to work out that sum ye\u0027rself, Abner, if it\u0027s not too hard.\" \n \n \"Now, that\u0027s jist the trouble. It is too hard. Ye see, me ancestors are to blame. They were all fightin\u0027 men, an\u0027 so that spirit has come down to me.\" \n \n \"H\u0027m,\" Zeb sniffed. \"The trouble with you is that ye\u0027ve chosen ye\u0027r own ancestors.\" \n \n \"Chosen me own ancestors! How could a man do that?\" \n \n \"Easy enough. Ye\u0027ve got a quarrelsome spirit, Abner, an\u0027 ye naturally choose sich dead men as suit ye. Ye kin go to the past fer anythin\u0027, it seems t\u0027 me, jist as people go to the Bible to find what agrees with their way of thinkin\u0027. Now, isn\u0027t that so?\" \n \n \"But what am I to do, Zeb?\" \n \n \"Think of men who have followed peace instead of war; men who have served their country an\u0027 sacrificed themselves. If ye kin do that, perhaps ye\u0027ll git their spirit, which, in my opinion, will do ye a great deal of good.\" \n \n \"Mebbe ye\u0027r right, Zeb,\" Abner agreed. \"But darn it all, I don\u0027t know nuthin\u0027 about men of peace who sacrificed themselves fer others. I\u0027ve already sacrificed much fer Glucom by lookin\u0027 after Joe Preston. If that wasn\u0027t a good deed fer the welfare of the community, then I\u0027d like to know what it was.\" \n \n \"But ye\u0027r heart wasn\u0027t right, Abner,\" Zeb explained. \"There was anger there, an\u0027 when ye knocked Joe out ye never thought of the public good, but of ye\u0027r own personal injury. That\u0027s not the way. Git them good ancestors to work, then ye\u0027ll know what I mean, an\u0027 ye\u0027ll begin to rub people the right way. Life will be much more pleasant, see if it isn\u0027t.\" \n \n \"Good ancestors, rubbin\u0027 people the right way,\" Abner muttered, as he plodded along. \"I\u0027d like to know how to begin, skiddy-me-shins if I wouldn\u0027t.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1683/49585.html","bookId":1171,"book":{"id":1171,"title":"The Touch of Abner","description":"简介： These words drawled slowly forth produced an immediate effect, and caused fifty people to straighten suddenly up and look enquiringly around.
