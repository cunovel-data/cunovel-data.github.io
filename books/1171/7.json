{"id":15618,"no":7,"title":"CHAPTER VII","content":"BEATING THE MOVIES The next morning Abner worked at his potatoes. He was not fond of this job, as the weeds were very thick and his temper was none the best. It was hard, anyway, for him to settle down for any length of time to one task. He preferred boating or lumbering, with all the excitement and uncertainty attached to each. But to be penned down in a potato patch was almost more than he could endure. It might have been different if the soil had been productive, but after hard toil there was little to show for all his efforts. \"Might as well be in a chain-gang,\" he meditated, as he tore at the weeds. \"It\u0027s up one row an\u0027 down another, hour after hour. I jist feel wild fer somethin\u0027 to turn up. Wish to goodness Ikey Dimock \u0027ud happen along now. Mebbe he\u0027d git somethin\u0027 to-day he escaped yesterday.\" He paused, leaned on his hoe and looked across the field toward the gravel hill. As he did so his eyes opened wide in amazement, for there right on his land was a man with a strange looking instrument before him. He was pointing it in his direction, too. Maybe it was a gatling gun the fellow had. He had heard about such things. Ikey might have sent him to take the place by force. A fierce anger surged up in Abner\u0027s heart, and dropping his hoe, he sped to the house and took down his gun from its rack on the kitchen wall. When Mrs. Andrews asked him what he was going to do, he merely told her that there was a hawk after her chickens. Hurrying from the house, he made his way across the field, clutching his old shot-gun with both hands. He kept his eyes fixed upon the young man, every instant expecting to see him either run or show some sign of terror and beg for his life. But when the intruder merely paused in his work, tipped back his straw hat a little and faced him without the least shadow of fear, Abner became puzzled. If the stranger had only run, it would have been a great lark chasing him across the field, brandishing his gun and shouting wild words of defiance. But to see the man viewing him so calmly upset his calculations. He slowed down, and when a few yards away he stopped and glared savagely. \"Why don\u0027t you shoot?\" the stranger asked, in a matter-of-fact manner. \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 to,\" was the reply. \"Well, you\u0027re a long time about it.\" \"Ain\u0027t ye afraid?\" \"Afraid of what?\" \"That I\u0027ll shoot ye.\" \"Not with that old gun. It wouldn\u0027t shoot a cat, and, besides, I don\u0027t believe it\u0027s loaded.\" \"Want me to try?\" \"Sure; go ahead. I don\u0027t mind.\" \"Ye don\u0027t!\" \"No, not a bit. But hurry up. I\u0027m getting tired waiting.\" Abner was now in a fix. He never intended to shoot the intruder, but merely wished to frighten him away. He did not know what to do, and only glared harder than ever. \"Why don\u0027t you shoot?\" the stranger again asked. \"Hang the shootin\u0027,\" Abner growled, as he thumped the gun down upon the ground. \"De ye think I\u0027m a brute?\" \"Well, I wasn\u0027t altogether sure at first by the way you acted. I\u0027ve often met brutes on four legs which performed in a similar manner, so I was somewhat puzzled.\" \"An\u0027 wasn\u0027t there reason?\" Abner demanded. \"What bizness have ye comin\u0027 on to my land?\" \"What business? Why, my own, of course.\" \"An\u0027 what\u0027s that?\" \"Don\u0027t you know?\" \"Surveyin\u0027 my place, eh?\" \"Sure; what did you ask me for, then?\" \"But who sent ye here? Did Ikey Dimock?\" \"Ikey Dimock! Let me see,\" and the young man scratched his head, as if in perplexity. \"Say, I can\u0027t recall that name. Who is he? A friend of yours?\" \"A friend of mine! Say that agin an\u0027 I\u0027ll punch ye\u0027r face.\" \"Will you?\" \"Sure. I won\u0027t stand fer any foolin\u0027, mind. Ye\u0027r on my place, an\u0027 don\u0027t put on any of ye\u0027r high-falutin\u0027 airs.\" \"Maybe two can play at that game of punching faces,\" and the stranger smiled as he straightened himself up a bit. \"But I don\u0027t want to fight with you. Just let me alone until I get my work finished. If you want a row, go and fight the men who sent me here. Then you\u0027ll have all the fighting you can attend to.\" \"Who are they?\" Abner queried. \"The members of the Government, to be sure.\" \"What in blazes have they to do in the matter, I\u0027d like to know?\" \"A great deal, as you\u0027ll find out. They sent me here, so it\u0027s no use to shoot me, or try to punch my nose. I\u0027m only working under orders, and don\u0027t count.\" \"But what did they send ye here fer? Tell me that.\" \"To see how much gravel you have; that\u0027s why.\" \"Gravel! My gravel?\" \"Yes. All that hill,\" and the surveyor motioned to the left. \"An\u0027 they want it? What fer?\" \"For ballast.\" \"Ballast!\" \"Certainly. The wise ones have been very uneasy of late, and have done considerable thinking. They have at last concluded that there is too much gravel right on this part of the earth\u0027s surface, and so they\u0027ve decided to shift a portion of it to keep the old ship steady.\" \"Ye don\u0027t tell! An\u0027 where are they goin\u0027 to take it to?\" \"Oh, just to the new railroad. They need ballast for that, and this is extra good stuff.\" Abner lifted his old straw hat, and ran his fingers slowly through his hair. His eyes, which had been staring wide, now gradually contracted as he looked off toward the gravel hill. A new light was dawning upon his mind. He was face to face with a problem which he knew would tax his entire supply of \"brains, gall, an\u0027 luck.\" The surveyor, observing the expression upon his face, surmised its meaning, and his eyes twinkled. \"Catch on?\" he drawled. \"But where do I come in?\" Abner questioned. \"Oh, you\u0027re in already.\" \"Like the toad in the swill-pail, it seems to me. Not there by choice. But what am I to git out of it? That\u0027s what I want to know.\" \"Get out of it! Why, man, you\u0027ll be lucky to get out of it alive, same as the toad.\" \"I will, eh? An\u0027 why?\" \"Simply because you\u0027ve allowed that hill of gravel to remain there to endanger the world. That\u0027s about the first thing they\u0027ll tell you, and they\u0027ll put up such a big talk that you\u0027ll be glad to pay out your bottom dollar to help them take the gravel away.\" \"De ye think I\u0027m a fool?\" Abner roared, and again his eyes blazed. \"Not exactly, though you acted like one a few minutes ago. But I imagine you\u0027ll feel like one when that government bunch gets after you. They\u0027re past masters at the art of getting what they want. They will come here in autos, parade around the place, puff their expensive cigars, and hand out such talk that you\u0027ll feel small enough to crawl through a rat-hole. Oh, I\u0027ve seen such cases before, and I know just what they\u0027ll do.\" \"H\u0027m, I guess ye don\u0027t know Abner Andrews, then, not by a jugfull, skiddy-me-shins, if ye do. There\u0027ll be no crawlin\u0027, mind ye, to them big bugs. An\u0027 what\u0027s more, they\u0027ll never set foot on this place without my consent.\" \"They won\u0027t wait for your consent. They didn\u0027t send word, I suppose, asking if I might make this survey?\" \"No, not a line, the skunks.\" \"Neither will they ask permission to tramp over your land. They\u0027ll come unexpectedly, the same as I have.\" \"An\u0027 they\u0027ll go as unexpectedly as they\u0027ll come,\" and Abner stamped upon the ground. \"So will you go, young man. I ain\u0027t got nuthin\u0027 agin you personally, but ye represent that bunch of grafters, so out ye go at once, an\u0027 don\u0027t ye dare to put ye\u0027r foot upon this place agin without my permission.\" But the surveyor never moved. With his right arm resting lightly on the theodolite he fixed his eyes steadily upon the farmer. \"Ain\u0027t ye goin\u0027?\" Abner demanded. \"No.\" \"Ye ain\u0027t! Well, I guess ye\u0027ll change ye\u0027r tune, me hearty, before I\u0027m through with ye.\" Suddenly raising the gun by the barrel with both hands, he drew it back over his left shoulder in a most threatening manner. \"Git,\" he roared, \"or I\u0027ll knock out ye\u0027r brains, providin\u0027 ye\u0027ve got any.\" \"Go ahead, then,\" was the quiet reply. \"What! ain\u0027t ye afraid?\" Abner asked. \"Afraid of what?\" \"That I\u0027ll kill ye.\" \"H\u0027m, I wish you would. It would save me from doing it myself. So hurry up.\" Abner\u0027s eyes bulged with amazement, and he slowly lowered his gun. \"Say, ye\u0027r not luney, are ye?\" he queried. \"Do you think I am?\" \"Well, there must be somethin\u0027 wrong with a chap who wants to be killed, that\u0027s all.\" \"So you\u0027re not going to knock out my brains after all?\" \"Naw, I ain\u0027t no murderer.\" \"Too bad,\" and the surveyor gave a deep sigh. \"It\u0027s very disappointing.\" Abner was now completely bewildered, and he knew not what to do. For once in his life he was unable to make any reply. If the young man had shown the least sign of fear, or had even argued, it would have been different. But to see him so calm and unconcerned was what puzzled him. He was mad, and yet it did no good. The more excited he became, the cooler seemed the surveyor. What was he to do? He did not wish to leave the fellow and go back to the house, as that would be an acknowledgment of defeat. Happening to glance away to the left, he was much relieved to see Jess walking across the field carrying a dish of wild strawberries she had just picked. \"Hi thar, Jess,\" he called. \"Come here. I want ye.\" At these words the surveyor turned his head. Seeing the girl approaching, he suddenly straightened himself up from his listless attitude, while an expression of interest dawned in his eyes. Jess was certainly fair to look upon as she drew near to where the two men were standing. It was little wonder that the surveyor\u0027s heart suddenly thrilled, and his hand touched his hat. Her trim lithe figure was clad in a simple white dress, open at the throat. Her arms were bare to the elbows, and her fingers bore the crimson stains of the strawberries she had recently picked. Beneath her broad-rimmed hat tresses of wavy dark-brown hair drifted waywardly and temptingly over her sun-browned neck, cheeks and forehead. Her eyes expressed surprise as she glanced at the young man, then at her father, and finally at the grounded gun. \"What\u0027s the matter, daddy?\" she enquired. \"You look dangerous.\" \"An\u0027 I feel dangerous,\" Abner retorted. \"But that\u0027s as fer as I kin git, blamed if it ain\u0027t.\" \"But what are you going to do with that gun?\" \"Nuthin\u0027, \u0027cept tote it back to the house.\" \"What did you bring it here for, then?\" \"To scare that,\" and Abner motioned toward the surveyor. Jess looked at the young man and detected an expression of amusement in his eyes, although his face remained perfectly grave. \"What did you want to scare him for, daddy?\" \"\u0027Cause he\u0027s trespassin\u0027, that\u0027s why. He wants to steal our place.\" \"Steal our place!\" Jess repeated in astonishment. \"Yes, that\u0027s jist it. He wants it fer a bunch of government grafters, an\u0027 when I threatened to shoot him or brain him he up an\u0027 says that he wants to be killed. Now, what de ye make of that?\" A new light of animation now beamed in Jess\u0027 eyes, and she advanced a step toward the surveyor. Here was a case which demanded her immediate attention, and she felt much elated. \"Why do you want to be killed?\" she asked. \"Simply because there is no reason why I should live,\" was the reply. \"Oh, nonsense,\" and Jess stamped her right foot lightly upon the ground. \"You should not utter such words. Why, a man is a coward who wants to die. It proves that he is afraid to live. Isn\u0027t that the truth?\" \"Perhaps it is. But that\u0027s the way I feel, anyway.\" \"You are looking at things in a wrong light,\" Jess continued. \"You need a new outlook on life, a strong, noble view. That is what will lift you out of the depths of despair. You should read \u0027Above the Clouds.\u0027 It is just the book you need, and I shall gladly let you have my copy.\" \"Give it to him, Jess,\" Abner encouraged. \"Pile on the Social Service dope. That\u0027ll fix him, all right.\" \"You are too self-centred,\" Jess went on. \"You should not let your thoughts dwell on your own troubles, but think of others and try to help them.\" \"Good advice, young man,\" Abner chuckled. \"Fergit ye\u0027r worries, like a lobster in bilin\u0027 water. Go on, Jess; ye\u0027r doin\u0027 fine.\" But Jess did not go on. A sudden embarrassment seized her, caused by the peculiar look she observed in the surveyor\u0027s eyes. It was an expression, so she thought, of mingled surprise and amusement. What must he be thinking of her? she asked herself. Her enthusiasm had carried her away. Never before had she spoken to a strange man in such a manner. A deep flush mantled her cheeks, and she glanced nervously around as if anxious to hurry away. \"Surely you\u0027re not going to leave,\" the young man remarked. \"I am enjoying myself immensely.\" \"You are!\" It was all Jess could say. \"Certainly. I haven\u0027t enjoyed myself so much for a long time. To be held up at the point of a gun; threatened to be brained, and then to listen to such words of wisdom all in one day is most unusual.\" \"Better\u0027n a movie-show, skiddy-me-shins if it ain\u0027t,\" Abner growled. For a few seconds there was a dead silence. Then the humor of the situation dawned upon Jess, and a sunny smile wreathed her face and her eyes danced with merriment. The surveyor\u0027s laugh, on the other hand, was like a pigmy explosion. He evidently had been controlling himself with the greatest effort, and this outburst was a welcome relief to his pent-up feelings. Jess, too, laughed heartily now, while Abner\u0027s face was twisted into a broad grin, as he thumped the stock of his gun several times upon the ground. \"Ho ho!\" he roared. \"This is a movin\u0027-picture show, all right. Gun, villain, an\u0027 gal all here. Why, it beats the movies all holler.\" Then he stepped up to the surveyor, and held out his hand. \"Say, young feller,\" he began, \"put it thar. Ye\u0027r all right, an\u0027 I guess ye kin go ahead with ye\u0027r surveyin\u0027. I do sartinly like the cut of ye\u0027r jib. drop around to the house some evenin\u0027 an\u0027 have a smoke.\" \"Not \u0027Above the Clouds,\u0027 but in them; is that it?\" he asked, turning to Jess. \"Whichever you prefer,\" was the reply. \"Or you may have both, if you wish,\" she added as an afterthought. The surveyor watched the father and daughter as they left him and walked slowly across the field. He seemed to be in no hurry to go on with his work, but stood there until the two had disappeared within the house. \"And so that is the noted Abner Andrews, is it?\" he mused. \"And I was told that he wouldn\u0027t let me survey his gravel hill. I\u0027ve won the bet, all right. He certainly is a queer cuss, and I thought at one time that I wouldn\u0027t leave this place alive. How in heaven\u0027s name does he happen to have a daughter like that? Good Lord, what a girl!\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1683/49575.html","bookId":1171,"book":{"id":1171,"title":"The Touch of Abner","description":"简介： These words drawled slowly forth produced an immediate effect, and caused fifty people to straighten suddenly up and look enquiringly around.
