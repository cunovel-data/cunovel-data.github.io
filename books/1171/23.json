They had been over the island, and had now come back to where Billy was lying upon the sand. Not a sign of the women and children could they see, and Abner was somewhat anxious. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Surely the spooks haven\u0027t carried \u0027em off,\" he continued. \"I\u0027ve heard people tell about strange sights an\u0027 noises in this place, but I allus laffed at \u0027em. Mebbe they was right, though.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Royden was standing upon a rock looking keenly down river. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do you suppose they\u0027re in that old barn out on that stretch of lowland?\" he asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What would they be doin\u0027 there?\" Abner enquired, as he, too, turned his face in that direction. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Perhaps they\u0027ve gone in out of the sun. Children like to play in old barns. I did, anyway, when I was a kid.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The barn to which Royden referred was on a narrow strip of marsh land, which ran for some distance out into the river. Hay was stored here until it could be hauled to the mainland in winter. It was an old weather-beaten building, and had been much battered by the flowing ice in the great spring rush. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Surely they wouldn\u0027t be in a place like that,\" Abner mused, as he stood looking at the barn. \"But ye kin never tell what notions women an\u0027 kids\u0027ll take, so it\u0027s jist as well to investigate.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Royden at once offered to go, but Abner detained him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Look here, young man, you\u0027ve done enough trampin\u0027 fer a while. Let that lazy feller down there go. I guess his clothes are dry by this time. If they ain\u0027t, then a little touch of this breeze\u0027ll finish the job.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Billy, however, was loth to go, and said that he didn\u0027t feel well. He preferred to stay where he was. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sick, are ye?\" and Abner turned suddenly upon him. \"Well, it\u0027s fer the good of ye\u0027r health that I\u0027m askin\u0027 ye to take this little jant. If ye stay here ye\u0027ll be a darn sight sicker than ye are at present, let me tell ye that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Something about Abner\u0027s voice and manner made Billy realise that he must obey. Slowly he rose to his feet and stretched himself. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Confound it all!\" he growled. \"Why can\u0027t a fellow have a minute\u0027s peace!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Peace! Peace!\" Abner roared, now thoroughly disgusted. \"I\u0027ll give ye a kind of peace ye ain\u0027t lookin\u0027 fer, an\u0027 that\u0027ll be a piece of me boot. That\u0027s the only kind the likes of you understand. Hustle along there now, an\u0027 don\u0027t dilly-dally.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The two men watched Billy as he sauntered leisurely along the shore, picking his way among the stones. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, if that don\u0027t beat the Dutch!\" Abner exclaimed. \"I wonder what the Lord was thinkin\u0027 of when he made sich a critter.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He must be fond of making that kind, though,\" Royden replied. \"He has a long list to His credit.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Abner pulled out his pipe, filled and lighted it. He then stretched himself out upon the ground in such a position that he could keep his eye upon Billy, who was now some distance away. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Come to think of it,\" he began, \"I don\u0027t believe the Lord is altogether to blame fer sich articles that walk on two legs an\u0027 call themselves men. He intended that they should be all right, an\u0027 gave them their own free will. But seems to me that that critter\u0027s ancestors, let the sap run out of the tree, an\u0027 there\u0027s mighty little left to work with. Zeb was right when he said that all the Social Service in the world won\u0027t do more\u0027n elevate a pig into a hog. Jess will come to see that, too, as sure as guns.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is Miss Andrews as keen as ever on Social Service?\" Royden asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Jist as keen,\" Abner replied. \"But she\u0027s got her hands full now with them kids. That\u0027s one reason why I\u0027m willin\u0027 to keep \u0027em. Jess an\u0027 Belle are mighty interested in \u0027em, an\u0027 that\u0027s a great deal to me an\u0027 Tildy. But jist look at that feller; he ain\u0027t to the barn yit. I wonder how long he intends to hang around. I don\u0027t want him, an\u0027 I\u0027m dang sure Belle doesn\u0027t, either. How de ye s\u0027pose we kin git clear of him?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Can\u0027t you think of some way?\" Royden asked, with a twinkle in his eyes. \"If you should behave to him like you did to me the first day we met, I don\u0027t believe Billy would remain long.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I was pretty het up that day I took the gun to ye,\" Abner acknowledged. \"But it didn\u0027t work. Ye was too much fer me, all right, an\u0027 I ain\u0027t ashamed to confess it. Why, most chaps would have hollered, an\u0027 made no end of a fuss. But you was dead game, an\u0027 that put me off me reckonin\u0027.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Before Royden could reply a yell of terror fell upon their ears. Startled, they both sprang to their feet, and looked anxiously in the direction from which the sound came. And as they did so, they saw Billy coming toward them with great leaps, followed by an animal which they at once recognized as an infuriated bull. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Good Lord!\" Abner ejaculated. \"Where in thunder did that critter come from? Why, I know. It\u0027s Pete Slocum\u0027s. He said he was goin\u0027 to put it on the island, as he couldn\u0027t keep it in the pasture. I fergot all about it, blamed if I didn\u0027t.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Billy will be killed,\" Royden exclaimed, much excited. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not at the rate he\u0027s runnin\u0027 now,\" was the reply. \"Did ye ever see anythin\u0027 like it? Why, the grass must be hot under his feet. I didn\u0027t know he had sich speed aboard. Look at that fer jumps! An\u0027 listen to his yells. He\u0027ll have lockjaw if he isn\u0027t keerful.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n It certainly was a wild run Billy was making, with the bull in close pursuit. Notwithstanding Abner\u0027s apparent amusement, he was really concerned, and was about to rush forward, though he was sure he could not reach the youth in time to be of any assistance, as he had no weapon with which to fight the bull. He was on the point of starting, anyway, when he noticed that Billy was making straight for a clump of birch trees standing low on the bank of the island. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Good fer him!\" he exclaimed. \"He\u0027s some sense left yit.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Will he make it, do you think?\" Royden almost breathlessly asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Make it? Sure. If that feller makes heaven as sartin as he\u0027ll make that tree, he\u0027ll be all right, though I guess he won\u0027t make it as fast. Look at that! Why, he went up it like a cat. He\u0027s safe, all right, now,\" and Abner breathed a sigh of relief. \"Gee whittaker! He\u0027s a wonder when a bull\u0027s after him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What shall we do?\" Royden asked. \"We can\u0027t leave him there, and the bull doesn\u0027t seem inclined to go away. Look how he\u0027s roaring around that tree and tearing up the ground.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We\u0027ll fix that critter, all right,\" Abner replied. \"Let\u0027s git a couple of hand-spikes. Wish to goodness I\u0027d brought me axe along.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Searching among the drift-wood, they soon found two stout sticks. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I guess these\u0027ll do,\" Abner remarked, as he tested them over a log. \"Now fer some fun.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Royden could not see much fun in the undertaking, though he followed his companion without a word. Making their way as speedily as possible along the shore, they at length came near enough for the bull to observe their presence. He stopped pawing for a few seconds, and stared angrily at the intruders. Then his right fore hoof again tore up the turf, and his roars became more furious than ever. \\n\\n \\n\\n Abner now seemed in his element. His eyes glowed with the light of battle, and, grasping his stick firmly with both hands, he rushed forward. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Come on, me beauty,\" he challenged. \"I\u0027ll make ye roar.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And the bull did come. With a toss of its great head, and another angry bellow, it charged upon the two men. Seeing it coming, Abner slowed down, and was about to stop, when in an instant his foot caught on a root, and before he could recover himself he had fallen headlong upon the ground. The bull was now almost upon him, and in another second its horns would have pierced the prostrate man\u0027s body, but as the brute lowered its head for a great thrust, Royden dealt him a staggering blow right across the forehead, which brought him to his knees. Before he could recover, a second blow followed, which caused him to plunge heavily and fall headlong upon the ground, tearing up as he did so long strips of turf with his powerful horns. \\n\\n \\n\\n By this time Abner was on his feet, angry at himself for falling, and ready to have revenge upon the animal. Seizing his stick, which he had dropped, he thrust it into the bull\u0027s side. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Git up, ye brute,\" he cried. \"Ye\u0027ll have better manners next time, all right. Git up, I say. Take that, an\u0027 that, an\u0027 that, ye divil.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n So fierce were the thrusts that the half-stunned animal bellowed with increased vigor, and with a great effort scrambled to his feet, where he stood for a few seconds shaking his head, while his eyes glowed like red-hot coals. With Royden standing before him ready to administer another blow, and Abner goring his side and yelling words of defiance, the brute became completely bewildered. A nameless terror seized him, and with a peculiar growl of rage and fear, he attempted to escape. He staggered from side to side for a few yards, but presently he started on a run, which shortly developed into a mad gallop, as if all the fiends in the world were after him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ye\u0027ve forgot somethin\u0027,\" Abner shouted. \"Come back an\u0027 git the change.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The bull kept on with his headlong flight, dashed into the woods, and disappeared from view. They could hear him crashing his way among the trees as he sped onward. Farther and farther he went, the sounds of his flight growing fainter and fainter, until at last they could no longer be heard. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Guess he\u0027s gone fer good,\" and Abner breathed a deep sigh. \"He\u0027ll have somethin\u0027 to think over fer a while. Mebbe he\u0027ll let folks alone after this. But, jiminey! He nearly fixed me, all right.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It was a close call,\" Royden replied. \"He was almost upon you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I wonder where I\u0027d been now,\" Abner mused, \"if you hadn\u0027t brought him to his knees. I expect to sprout me final wings some day, but, hang it all, I didn\u0027t think I\u0027d come so close to doin\u0027 it so soon, an\u0027 on this island at that. But, then, one never knows what to expect next, as Tom Bentley said when his big ram butted him clean through the barn-door. I\u0027m mighty obliged to ye, young man, fer gittin\u0027 me out of that scrap, an\u0027 I shan\u0027t fergit it soon, either.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Seeing that the danger was past, Billy climbed down from the tree and came over to where the two men were standing. He was angry, and he did not mince matters. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Look here,\" he began, \"what did you mean by sending me to that barn when you knew that devil was there? That\u0027s the reason you wouldn\u0027t go yourselves. A pretty mess you got me into, didn\u0027t you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Keep cool, young man,\" Abner advised. \"Don\u0027t blame anyone, fer I didn\u0027t know that critter was here. But seems to me you was the best one to go, even if we had known.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why is that, I\u0027d like to know?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Cause that face of yours would stop anythin\u0027, even a bull.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But it didn\u0027t, you fool,\" was the angry retort. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, sartinly not, fer ye never gave the critter a chance to look at it. If ye had, it would have busted itself runnin\u0027 the other way.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, I\u0027m done with this whole shooting match,\" Billy declared. \"I\u0027ve had enough to do me the rest of my life. I shall report you to your boss, for I\u0027m d—— sure that was a put-up job, and nothing else.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All right, me hearty, report all ye like, an\u0027 the sooner ye go the better. When I was a kid we ginerally handed out somethin\u0027 interestin\u0027 to the chap that told tales on others. He was put down as a baby an\u0027 the fellers didn\u0027t have much use fer him, let me tell ya that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do you mean to say that I\u0027m a baby?\" Billy demanded. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, not altogether, as fer as size an\u0027 tongue goes, at any rate. But, my, how ye\u0027r parents must have loved ye to let ye grow up. If they could only have seen ye when ye was sprintin\u0027 in front of that bull, an\u0027 climbin\u0027 that tree, I\u0027m sure they\u0027d have been mighty proud of ye. But, hello, what in the deuce is all this?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Angry though he was, Billy was compelled to turn in the direction Abner was looking. Coming across the marsh were the berry pickers, lined out in single file, like Indians on the march. Mrs. Andrews led, followed by the five children, with Belle and Jess bringing up in the rear. As they approached it was plainly evident that they were tired and greatly excited. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, where in time did yez all drop from?\" Abner demanded, as they at last rounded up in front of him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"From that barn, of course,\" his wife impatiently replied. \"Where else did you think we had come from?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Chased in there by that bull, eh? Well, it was mighty lucky ye had sich a place to flee to, let me tell ye that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, daddy, it was awful!\" Jess exclaimed. \"We just got there in the nick of time when that terrible creature came after us.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n As Jess uttered the word \u0027daddy\u0027 Billy gave a great start and looked keenly at Abner. His face grew suddenly pale, and his body trembled. He began to understand something now which he had never suspected. He hardly knew what to do. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Did ye see the fight?\" Abner asked. \"We settled that critter, all right. But I\u0027m mighty disapp\u0027inted, Jess.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What at, daddy?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That ye didn\u0027t try some of ye\u0027r Social Service dope upon that brute.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Social Service on a creature like that!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sure. That\u0027s what it\u0027s fer, so ye\u0027ve told me. To elevate things, lift \u0027em up, so to speak.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But we couldn\u0027t do anything with an animal like that,\" Jess explained. \"A stick is the only way you can handle such a beast.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ho, ho, Jess, ye\u0027r sartinly right this time. A club\u0027s the only thing a critter like that understands. An\u0027 it\u0027s jist the same with a lot of people, \u0027specially men. They understand gentle handlin\u0027, soothin\u0027 words, an\u0027 sich things about as much as that bull does, an\u0027 ye know what effect they\u0027d have upon him. There are some critters ye kin elevate by rubbin\u0027 gently an\u0027 pilin\u0027 on the honey, but as fer as I kin see, there\u0027s a dang lot of people ye kin handle only one way, an\u0027 that\u0027s with a thick club. That\u0027s the Social Service dope they need.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"For pity\u0027s sake, Abner, will you ever stop talking?\" his wife asked. \"You seem to be wound up and guaranteed to run forever. We\u0027re all tired out, and the children are hungry.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hungry!\" and Abner looked around. \"Where kin we find grub fer all these in a place like this? I s\u0027pose the bull ate up everything, did he?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The baskets are all right,\" Mrs. Andrews explained. \"We left them in a safe place near the boat.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Good fer you, Tildy. I\u0027d bank on you every time to look after sich matters. The grub\u0027s safe, hurrah! Come on, one an\u0027 all, an\u0027 let\u0027s jine in the feast.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1683/49591.html","bookId":1171,"book":{"id":1171,"title":"The Touch of Abner","description":"简介： These words drawled slowly forth produced an immediate effect, and caused fifty people to straighten suddenly up and look enquiringly around.
