{"id":15630,"no":19,"title":"CHAPTER XIX","content":"JERRY, ME PARDNER \\n\\n \\n\\n It was late when Abner awoke the next morning. This was a most unusual thing for him, and he felt annoyed at himself as he hurriedly dressed and hastened downstairs. The house seemed to be deserted. He glanced at the clock, and was surprised to find that it was a quarter to nine. His breakfast was all ready on the table, but no one was to be seen. A copy of The Live Wire lying by his plate arrested his attention. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Some class to this,\" he remarked, half aloud, as he unfolded the paper. \"Jist like a hotel; breakfast waitin\u0027, an\u0027 the mornin\u0027 paper right at hand. Reg\u0027lar Waldorf-Astoria style. Hello! what in time——!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n His eyes had caught sight of the big headlines, and he saw his own name prominently displayed along with Joe Preston\u0027s. It was a great write-up, and Abner read it through to the bitter end. It told of his savage attack upon the editor, how he looked and acted, and of his arrest and confinement in jail. Then followed a description of his life\u0027s history, which ended by saying that he had been looked upon as dangerous for some time. It was really believed by many that, owing to his peculiar actions, he was not altogether in his right mind. The incident of his offering one thousand dollars toward the Orphanage was mentioned, and how he did not have enough money to pay even five dollars, let alone the whole amount. Not a word was said in his favor. He was painted in the darkest colors, and it was suggested that he should either be placed in the Asylum as a lunatic, or in the Penitentiary as a most dangerous character. \\n\\n \\n\\n A peculiar expression overspread Abner\u0027s face as he finished reading. He laid the paper aside and began his breakfast. When he was through, he filled his pipe and walked out of the house. The rain had ceased in the night, but the air was damp and heavy. It was a gloomy morning, and accorded perfectly with the state of his mind. He heard the voices of the children in the barn and knew that the girls were with them. It was the best place to play on a day such as this. He had no mind to join them, as he wished to be alone in order to think. \\n\\n \\n\\n He stood for a few minutes near the woodshed, looking down upon the river, over which drifted a heavy mist. He longed to be out there in the Flying Scud, away from all land-lubbers. It was the life to which he was especially fitted. Picking up his axe, which was lying by the chopping-block, he threw it over his shoulder and walked rapidly toward the shore. There was considerable drift-wood to be gathered, and he generally spent wet days at this work. He needed something to do, and in wrestling with the roots, logs, and blocks he could give physical vent to his pent-up feelings. \\n\\n \\n\\n His row-boat was pulled up on the beach, and his small canoe, used for muskrat and duck shooting, was lying bottom up among the bushes. He was tempted to launch the latter, cross to the island and spend the day there. Any place was preferable to remaining near home where he knew that ere long he must submit to a regular bombardment of questions. He wondered what had become of his wife. It was a most unusual thing for her to be absent from home at this time of the morning. He could see the house plainly from where he stood on the shore, and he occasionally turned and looked in that direction. Abner was well aware that he should go to town for Jerry, but he was in no mood for the long walk over the muddy roads. He would need the horse for haying as soon as the weather cleared. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Confound it all!\" he growled. \"I don\u0027t want to see that town agin fer a long time. I\u0027m sick of it. Why can\u0027t people leave me alone, anyway? They\u0027ll all read that piece in the paper, an\u0027 they\u0027ll think I\u0027m the biggest villain on the face of the hull earth. I wonder how Zeb would act if he\u0027d been rubbed the wrong way most of his life sich as I have. Peaceful ancestors, be blowed!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n In order to express his feelings he started to work, and every blow of the axe was not only upon log or block, but upon his enemies. This violent exercise did him a great deal of good, and he mentally compared the joy of being in the fresh air with the stuffy and unsavory jail. \\n\\n \\n\\n After an hour of such work he felt in a better frame of mind. He had put all of his enemies to flight and was the victor. There was joy in the feeling, and his face wore a more benign expression when he at length paused, seated himself upon a log, and began to re-fill his pipe. He thus sat looking out over the water, thinking of his previous day\u0027s experiences, and of what Zeb had to say about his peaceful ancestors. At times he felt that his neighbor was right, but the spirits of his war-like ancestors had been with him for so long that he found it most difficult to rid himself of their influence. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s a darn hard thing to shake off old friends,\" he muttered. \"It\u0027s \u0027specially hard when ye\u0027r in sympathy with \u0027em, an\u0027 want to do jist as they did. They\u0027ve stood by me fer many a year now, an\u0027 their words an\u0027 actions have allus jibed with mine. I wonder if me peaceful ancestors will see eye to eye with me. That\u0027s the pint Zeb didn\u0027t take into consideration. If I\u0027ve got to trim me sails to their gentle actions I\u0027m afraid I\u0027ll land in the lunatic asylum fer sure.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He was aroused from his meditation by a step behind him, and looking quickly around, he saw a man approaching but a few yards away. The presence of this stranger annoyed Abner. What right had anyone to creep upon him that way? he asked himself. \\n\\n \\n\\n But the visitor was by no means daunted by Abner\u0027s surly expression. He came jauntily forward, and held out a big fat hand. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Glad to meet you, Mr. Andrews,\" he accosted. \"Having a quiet time here all by yourself, I see. Beautiful spot, isn\u0027t it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is it?\" Abner sullenly asked, as he viewed the man most carefully. He did not like his looks, and he believed him to be an agent, who wished to sell him apple-trees. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s the finest place I\u0027ve seen in a long time,\" the man replied. \"And look at that wood! I suppose you get your winter\u0027s supply here. You are fortunate. We in the city have to buy ours, while the Lord casts yours right at your door.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You come from the city, eh?\" Abner queried. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, yes. Have lived there all my life, though I do long to spend the rest of my days in the country, away from all bustle and confusion, and live the quiet life.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"To pile drift-wood and do sich jobs, I s\u0027pose?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, that would be a pleasure. Good for the appetite.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Think ye\u0027d make enough to eat on this place?\" Abner asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure I could. Why, all you farmers have to do is to go into the garden, for your supplies, and to the shore for your fuel, while we in the city have to pay for such things.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Abner felt like kicking this fellow and telling him in no uncertain language what a fool he was. But he thought of his peaceful ancestors and so changed his mind. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, ye\u0027r quite right, Mister,\" he drawled. \"We do have a great time here in the bush. Lots to eat in the summer time fer nuthin\u0027. An\u0027 in the winter it\u0027s jist the same. We eat icicles fer breakfast, warmed-up snow fer dinner, an\u0027 fer supper we have a slice off one of them cedar blocks there. Ye see, them sticks have been floatin\u0027 so long in the river that they have a fishy smell, an\u0027 when a piece is fried in molasses, why, ye couldn\u0027t tell it from the finest lake trout. Did ye ever try one?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I certainly never did,\" the stranger smilingly replied. \"It must be rather hard to digest, isn\u0027t it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, we don\u0027t use our digesters in the winter time. We lay \u0027em away in the cellar until spring. It\u0027s great how they work then, after a good long rest.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I see you\u0027re quite a humorist, Mr. Andrews,\" and again the visitor smiled. \"Life in the country is conducive to humor, I suppose?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sure. It\u0027s the funniest place ye ever sot eyes on. It makes people roarin\u0027 funny all the time. Why, when we go to the city people jist stand and laff at us, an\u0027 the funny papers fill their pages with humor about the doin\u0027s of the bush. Everythin\u0027 is funny here. Even Abner Andrews is considered a humorous cuss, an\u0027 that\u0027s sayin\u0027 a good deal.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The visitor now realized that this quaint farmer was slyly poking fun at him, and he was anxious to change the subject. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve come to see you on an important matter, Mr. Andrews,\" he explained, \"and as I am in a hurry, I shall come to business at once. I\u0027m a real estate agent, with my office in the city, and I am anxious to make some enquiries about your farm. I have come in the interest of a man who is seeking for a suitable place to build a large summer hotel. Now, as you have such an excellent location here, I feel that this is just the right spot for the hotel. The view is excellent, the river is right near for boating and bathing, and from all accounts there are fine lakes and brooks back in the hills for trout fishing. Is not that so?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ye\u0027r sartinly right,\" Abner assented. \"Ye couldn\u0027t find a nicer spot if ye hunted the hull province over.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m very glad that you agree with me, Mr. Andrews,\" the visitor replied, somewhat surprised as he had been warned to beware of the farmer, as he was a most disagreeable man to deal with. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, I don\u0027t mind agreein\u0027 with sich things, Mister, \u0027specially so when they\u0027re correct.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And you think it would be an excellent place for a summer hotel?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sure, I do. Why, a man \u0027ud make his fortune in no time. It wouldn\u0027t cost him nuthin\u0027 to feed the people. They\u0027d catch all the trout they could eat, an\u0027 when they didn\u0027t want fish they could jist set on the grass an\u0027 feed upon the beauties of Nature. It \u0027ud be cheap fer the people, too, \u0027cause they wouldn\u0027t have to bother with fine clothes. When they weren\u0027t fishin\u0027 they\u0027d be in bathin\u0027, when they wouldn\u0027t need no clothes at all.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ha, ha, that certainly would be fine,\" the agent laughed. \"Utopia, eh?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m not,\" Abner declared. \"Don\u0027t ye say that agin.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Say what?\" the stranger asked in surprise. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ask me if I\u0027m a toper. I never got real drunk in me life. I never took too much.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You misunderstand me, Mr. Andrews,\" the agent explained, much amused. \"I didn\u0027t say \u0027toper,\u0027 but \u0027Utopia,\u0027 which means a most delightful place, where people are all happy, and life is simple and free.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, that\u0027s what ye mean, is it? Well, fer heaven\u0027s sake, why didn\u0027t ye say so an\u0027 speak plain English instid of sich city jargon? I ain\u0027t got time to waste this mornin\u0027, if you have.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Neither have I,\" the agent replied, looking at his watch. \"My, I have to be in Glucom in half an hour! Look here, will you sell your place?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How are ye travellin\u0027?\" Abner asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"By auto. It\u0027s out there on the road.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"An\u0027 ye\u0027re goin\u0027 right straight to Glucom, eh?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, as soon as I get through with this business. Will you sell, Mr. Andrews?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n For a few seconds Abner did not reply. He thought of his horse in town, an\u0027 then of his peaceful ancestors. If he could rub this man the right way, as Zeb suggested, it might save him that long walk. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am willing to make you a liberal offer,\" the agent continued. \"But I must have an answer to-day, or I shall have to choose another locality and you would be the loser.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m willin\u0027 to sell,\" Abner replied, as he slowly took the pipe from his mouth and studied it very carefully. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s good,\" the agent encouraged. \"Now, what\u0027s your figure?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Figger! Well, I can\u0027t jist tell ye off-hand. I\u0027ve got to consult me pardner.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Your wife, eh?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No she\u0027s not me pardner; she\u0027s me boss. Me pardner\u0027s in town jist now. We work this place together ye see, so I couldn\u0027t give ye a price without consultin\u0027 Jerry.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And Jerry\u0027s in town, is he?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sure. An\u0027 I can\u0027t do nuthin\u0027 without consultin\u0027 him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Suppose, then, you come along with me, and we can see Jerry,\" the visitor suggested. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Jist the thing, Mister,\" Abner agreed, rising to his feet and throwing the axe over his shoulder. \"I\u0027ll be with ye in a jiffy.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Abner hurried up to the house, chuckling as he went, while the agent strolled slowly toward the road, viewing the farm as he walked. Abner found no one in the house, and this made him wonder. But he had no time to delay just then, so, donning his coat, he was standing waiting as the car stopped at the gate. \\n\\n \\n\\n It did not take long to speed into Glucom. Abner compared this trip with the toilsome one he and Zeb had made the night before, and he decided that he would have a car of his own when he was able. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Where shall we go?\" the agent asked, as he swung the car into the main street. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"To the station,\" Abner replied. \\n\\n \\n\\n And to the station they sped, and when Abner stepped out he went at once into the office. There he found Sam, who greeted him like a long-lost brother, and offered him a chair. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Can\u0027t set down, Sam,\" Abner told him. \"I want Jerry; where is he?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"In Dingman\u0027s barn. He let me have the use of it for a few days. You\u0027ll find Jerry all right and in good condition.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Sam was much surprised at Abner\u0027s excited manner, and he watched him through the window as he spoke to the stranger in the car, and then hurried up the street. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What in time is Abner up to now, I wonder. Surely he\u0027s not going to sell his horse.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n It did not take Abner long to find Jerry, and when mounted upon the waggon, he drove proudly back to the station to the expectant agent. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Look here,\" the agent impatiently demanded, \"you have kept me a deuce of a long time. I\u0027m in a hurry.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I can\u0027t help that,\" Abner replied, as he reined Jerry up close to the station platform. \"I didn\u0027t tell ye to wait, did I?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But you wanted me to wait till you had consulted with your partner, didn\u0027t you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"So I did. What was I thinkin\u0027 about?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And you\u0027ve seen him?\" was the eager question. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sure, sure; I\u0027ve seen Jerry, all right.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is he willing to sell?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ye bet ye\u0027r boots he is. Jerry\u0027s willin\u0027, fer he\u0027s more tired of Ash Pint than of anythin\u0027 else. He needs more excitement than he kin find on a farm. He wants to be near the train so\u0027s he kin hear the en-gines holler. It allus puts new life into him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s fine. I suppose you\u0027ve agreed on the price?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, yes, we agree, all right, we allus do. Never had a fallin\u0027 out yit.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now, how much do you want for the place, Mr. Andrews?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, let me see,\" and Abner scratched his head in a thoughtful manner. \"Oh, I guess fifteen thousand\u0027ll do all right.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Fifteen thousand!\" the agent exclaimed. \"Fifteen thousand for that wretched place of yours, which is as poor as Job\u0027s turkey, so I understand. You must be crazy, man. Your farm isn\u0027t worth more than seven hundred dollars, and how have you the gall to value it at fifteen thousand? You don\u0027t pay taxes on more than five hundred, do you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mebbe I don\u0027t, Mister. But ye see there are some things ye\u0027r not taxed fer, an\u0027 them\u0027s the things which you an\u0027 others seem to think very valuable. There\u0027s the situation, which is the finest in the country, accordin\u0027 to ye\u0027r own statement. That should be worth five thousand; the view, fresh air, an\u0027 the boatin\u0027 an\u0027 swimmin\u0027 privileges, another five, so that makes ten thousand. Then there\u0027s the gravel on the place, an\u0027 I guess it\u0027s nearly all gravel, an\u0027 that\u0027s worth a great deal fer ballast, so I understand. It alone should bring fifteen thousand, but Jerry an\u0027 me are quite willin\u0027 to let ye have the hull outfit fer that amount, an\u0027 throw in the situation, air, an\u0027 sich things fer nuthin\u0027.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The agent was angry now, and it was with considerable effort that he controlled his temper. He knew that Abner was making fun of him, and this nettled him exceedingly. He was, in fact, beginning to doubt the farmer\u0027s sanity. He glanced at Jerry and then at the waggon. In his excitement he had not thought of their presence as unusual. Where had they come from, anyway? \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is that your horse?\" he abruptly asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Guess so.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But aren\u0027t you sure?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, sir-ee, I\u0027m not. Ye\u0027r never sure of that hoss. He\u0027s got a mind of his own, he has, jist like any pardner should have.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Partner!\" and the agent\u0027s eyes bulged with a new light. \"Do you mean to tell me that he\u0027s the partner you\u0027ve been speakin\u0027 about?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sure; I was tellin\u0027 ye no fib. A man might have a darn sight worse one, let me tell ye that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And he\u0027s Jerry?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yep; that\u0027s what I call him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n This was too much for the agent. With a savage oath, he settled himself back in his seat, and started the engine. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t ye want to buy our place?\" Abner asked. \"We\u0027re willin\u0027 to sell, ain\u0027t we, Jerry?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"To h—l with your place,\" the agent snarled, as he started the car. \"I wouldn\u0027t do business with a fool, and that\u0027s what you are.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Thanks fer the compliment an\u0027 fer the ride to town,\" Abner replied. \"If it hadn\u0027t been fer you I\u0027d had to walk here after Jerry. Guess it pays to rub people the right way, after all, ha, ha.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He watched the agent as he sped away. His mouth was expanded into a grin, and his gray eyes twinkled. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Peaceful ancestors!\" he chuckled. \"Whew! Guess Zeb was right after all. It sartinly does the work. That feller\u0027s been set on by Ikey Dimock as sure as I\u0027m livin\u0027. But Abner Andrews, of Ash Pint, wasn\u0027t caught nappin\u0027, not by a jugful, skiddy-me-shins if he was. Gid-dap, Jerry, me dear old pardner. We must git home an\u0027 face the music there.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1683/49587.html","bookId":1171,"book":{"id":1171,"title":"The Touch of Abner","description":"简介： These words drawled slowly forth produced an immediate effect, and caused fifty people to straighten suddenly up and look enquiringly around.
