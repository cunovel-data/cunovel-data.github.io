The reporter of The Live Wire gave one lightning glance toward the speaker, and then began to write rapidly upon his pad lying before him. The chairman, too, was visibly affected. He leaned forward, and searched the room with his small squinting eyes. \n \n \"Did I hear aright?\" he asked. \"Did someone say \u0027a thousand?\u0027\" \n \n At once a man in the back row started to rise, but was pulled quickly down by a woman sitting at his side. \n \n \"Let go my coat-tails, Tildy,\" he whispered. \n \n \"But, Abner, are you crazy?\" \n \n \"Crazy, be hanged! Leave me alone, can\u0027t ye?\" \n \n \"Oh, it\u0027s you, Mr. Andrews, is it?\" the chairman remarked. \n \n \"Yes, it\u0027s me all right.\" \n \n \"And you wish to give one thousand dollars?\" \n \n \"That\u0027s what I said.\" \n \n \"Well, then, will you please step forward and sign your name?\" \n \n \"Oh, that feller waggin\u0027 the pen kin do it better\u0027n me. Jist tell him to put Abner Andrews, of Ash Pint, down fer a thousand.\" \n \n \"But we would prefer to have your own signature,\" the chairman insisted. \"It is always customary in cases such as this.\" \n \n \"Are ye afraid that I\u0027ll back out, an\u0027 won\u0027t pay?\" \n \n \"No, not at all, Mr. Andrews. But, you see, it\u0027s more business-like to get your name in your own handwriting. We shall make an exception, though, in your case if you so earnestly desire it.\" \n \n \"Now ye\u0027re shoutin\u0027.\" \n \n \"Doing what?\" \n \n \"Shoutin\u0027; talkin\u0027 sense. Don\u0027t ye git me?\" \n \n \"H\u0027m, I see,\" and the chairman leaned his elbow upon the table and gently stroked his chin with the fingers of his right hand. \"I didn\u0027t understand you at first, as I am not accustomed to such expressions.\" \n \n \"But ye understand the meanin\u0027 of a thousand dollars, don\u0027t ye?\" \n \n \"Indeed, I do, Mr. Andrews, and what is more, I wish to thank you very heartily. I am sure that all here to-night feel most grateful to you for your generosity.\" \n \n \"Oh, I don\u0027t want ye\u0027r gratitude, an\u0027 as fer as I kin see, it\u0027s worth darn little.\" \n \n \"Abner! Abner!\" the voice at his side chided. \"What are you saying?\" \n \n \"Didn\u0027t ye hear, Tildy? Where\u0027s ye\u0027r ears?\" and Abner turned slightly toward his protesting wife. \"I was merely remarkin\u0027 that the gratitude of this gatherin\u0027 of men an\u0027 women is worth darn little. Now, d\u0027ye hear?\" \n \n \"How do you make that out, Mr. Andrews?\" the chairman sharply questioned. \"Such a statement demands an explanation.\" \n \n \"Hear! Hear!\" came from several. \n \n \"How do I make that out?\" Abner repeated, as he scratched the back of his head, and let his eyes roam for a few seconds around the room. \"Well, I\u0027m jist judgin\u0027 accordin\u0027 to what I have seen an\u0027 heard. Me an\u0027 Tildy came to town to-day to do a little shoppin\u0027, an\u0027 happenin\u0027 to hear that there was to be a meetin\u0027 of the influential people of this place to see about the buildin\u0027 of a Home fer orphan children, we made up our minds to come too. We\u0027re mightily interested in orphans, we surely are. I\u0027ve often told Tildy that it\u0027s a downright shame that this town hasn\u0027t sich a Home, where poor little orphan kids kin be well looked after.\" \n \n \"You\u0027re quite right, Mr. Andrews,\" the chairman assented. \"We have delayed this matter too long already. But now that you have given us such splendid assistance, the work should go rapidly forward. I am very glad that you and your wife came to this meeting.\" \n \n \"Yes, me an\u0027 Tildy came here,\" Abner continued, \"expectin\u0027 to see somethin\u0027 real grand. We\u0027ve heard a great deal of highfalutin\u0027 talk about poor little orphans an\u0027 what ought to be done fer \u0027em. But, skiddy-me-shins, as fer as I kin see it\u0027ll all end in wind, an\u0027 nuthin\u0027\u0027ll be done.\" \n \n \"I object to such remarks,\" a pompous little man protested, rising suddenly to his feet, and appealing to the chairman. \"We didn\u0027t come here to listen to such language and abuse from this ignorant countryman.\" \n \n \"You jist flop down an\u0027 hold ye\u0027r tongue, Ikey Dimock,\" Abner ordered. \"I\u0027ve got the floor at present, an\u0027 I intend to keep it, too, until I\u0027ve had my say. You made a big harangue a little while ago, an\u0027 how much was it worth? Ten dollars, that\u0027s all. An\u0027 you one of the richest men in town. An\u0027 that\u0027s the way with the rest of yez. Ye\u0027ve talked, but when it came to givin\u0027 yez wer\u0027n\u0027t there. That\u0027s the reason why I said ye\u0027r gratitude is worth darn little. I don\u0027t want ye\u0027r gratitude, anyway. It\u0027s them poor little orphan kids I\u0027m worried about, an\u0027 I guess I\u0027ll worry a long time before any Home is built, judgin\u0027 by this meetin\u0027. Come, Tildy, let\u0027s go home. I\u0027ve had enough of this.\" \n \n A complete silence reigned in the room as Abner and his wife walked slowly to the door. When they were at last out of the building, the chairman breathed a sigh of relief, and a slight smile flickered across his face. \n \n \"Now that the cyclone is over,\" he remarked, \"we will gather up the fragments that remain and go on with our building.\" \n \n A ripple of amusement passed through the assembly, and there were numerous whispered conversations. Instead of being very indignant at what Abner had said, all, except Isaac Dimock, were inclined to treat the countryman\u0027s cutting words as a joke. They wondered, nevertheless, at the offer he had made of one thousand dollars. The reporter kept steadily on with his writing. He was alive to the situation, and chuckled to himself as he thought of the stirring article he would have for The Live Wire in the morning. \n \n Abner untied his horse from the post near the place of meeting, while his wife scrambled up into the carriage. Neither had spoken a word since leaving the building. It was only when well started on their homeward way that Mrs. Andrews ventured to speak. \n \n \"What was the matter with you to-night, Abner?\" she enquired. \n \n \"Nuthin\u0027, as fer as I know.\" \n \n \"Yes, there was, or you wouldn\u0027t have spoken and acted the way you did.\" \n \n \"Oh, I jist wanted to give them folks a jolt, that\u0027s all.\" \n \n \"And made a fool of yourself, didn\u0027t you?\" \n \n \"De ye think I did, Tildy? Gid-dap, Jerry.\" \n \n \"I know it. Only a fool or a lunatic would offer to give one thousand dollars when he hasn\u0027t a cent to his name.\" \n \n \"Ye\u0027r wrong, Tildy. I\u0027m not crazy, an\u0027 I don\u0027t think I\u0027m altogether a fool. It was somethin\u0027 else that shook me timbers at the meetin\u0027.\" \n \n \"What was it?\" \n \n \"Oh, you know as well as I do. I imagined I was as rich as I used to be several hundred years ago, an\u0027——\" \n \n \"For pity sakes, Abner, stop that nonsense. Because you think you lived hundreds of years ago, and that you were very rich and a great man, doesn\u0027t make you rich and great now. You\u0027re only Abner Andrews of Ash Point, and can hardly pay your bills, let alone give one thousand dollars toward building a Home for orphan children.\" \n \n \"But, Tildy, I thought I was really old man Astor, an\u0027 saw millions of dollars right before me.\" \n \n \"Well, if that\u0027s the way you felt, I think it\u0027s about time we called in the doctor. There\u0027s surely something wrong with your head.\" \n \n \"But, Tildy, ye don\u0027t understand. De ye think I was goin\u0027 to set there an\u0027 let them people git off with their cussed meanness? Not by a jugful! Gid-dap, Jerry, what\u0027s the matter with ye?\" \n \n \"But what about that thousand dollars? Do you expect to pay it?\" \n \n \"Sure I do.\" \n \n \"Where\u0027s it to come from, then?\" \n \n \"Oh, I\u0027ll find it somewheres.\" \n \n \"Not out of that old farm of ours, let me tell you that. Why, it\u0027s nothing but a heap of gravel, and you know as well as I do how hard we scratch and dig to raise anything. But you would buy the place, no matter what I said.\" \n \n \"It\u0027s a mighty fine situation, though, Tildy. G\u0027long, Jerry.\" \n \n \"It may be that, Abner, but you can\u0027t live on a fine situation these days. Haven\u0027t you always had fine situations for over twenty years now, and what have they amounted to?\" \n \n \"Yes, I\u0027ve touched on a good many things in that time, Tildy. I ran the old \u0027Flyin\u0027 Scud\u0027 on the river fer five years; an\u0027 then I bought that thrashin\u0027 machine from Sol Britt, an\u0027 ran it fer awhile. After that I went in fer lumberin\u0027, an\u0027 kept it up fer several winters. Now I\u0027m into farmin\u0027. Yes, ye\u0027r quite right about the situations. I\u0027ve had several fine ones, sure enough.\" \n \n \"And made a mess of them all, Abner. Everything you touched failed. And I expect it will be the same with the farm.\" \n \n \"Oh, I don\u0027t know about that, Tildy. We manage to git along an\u0027 make a comfortable livin\u0027. I\u0027ve allus depended upon three things to pull me through.\" \n \n \"You have? What are they? I never heard of them.\" \n \n \"Brains, gall, an\u0027 luck. They\u0027ve never failed me yit, an\u0027 I guess they won\u0027t now.\" \n \n \"H\u0027m,\" and Mrs. Andrews tossed her head in disgust. \"I know you\u0027ve got plenty of gall, but as for brains and luck, well, I have my serious doubts.\" \n \n \"Yes, I guess ye\u0027r right, Tildy. I reckon I had a lot of gall when I asked ye to marry me. But as fer brains an\u0027 luck, well I don\u0027t know. Gid-dap, Jerry.\" \n \n To these words Mrs. Andrews made no reply. Silence reigned for a few minutes, save for the rattle of the carriage and the beat of the horse\u0027s feet upon the road. Abner grew restless. He shifted uneasily in his seat, and coughed. Then he began to whistle, a sure sign of the agitated state of his mind. The whistle soon gave place to the humming of the only piece he knew: \n \n \"When Bill Larkins made his money, \n Piled it up in heaps galore, \n Dam old fool he wasn\u0027t happy, \n \u0027Cause he always wanted more.\" \n \n \n Even this didn\u0027t have the desired effect. He could stand anything from his wife but dead silence. That alone affected him. \n \n \"Say, Tildy,\" he at length ventured. \n \n \"Well, what is it? I should think you\u0027d be ashamed to speak to me after such insulting words.\" \n \n \"But, Tildy.\" \n \n \"Yes, I hear you. What is it?\" \n \n \"Didn\u0027t Ikey Dimock squirm when I landed on him? Ho, ho!\" \n \n \"And I squirmed, too, Abner. I never felt so ashamed of anything in all my life.\" \n \n \"But ye didn\u0027t squirm like Ikey, though, Tildy. My, it tickled me all to pieces to give him that jolt. Why, I knew Ikey when he used to pick pin-feathers off his mother\u0027s chickens when she was gittin\u0027 \u0027em ready fer market. He wasn\u0027 sich a bad critter then. But since he got hitched to that high-flyer, an\u0027 set up in the hardware bizness, ye can\u0027t touch him with a ten-foot pole. But I made him squirm. Ho, ho! G\u0027long, Jerry.\" \n \n \"Maybe you\u0027ll squirm, Abner, when they come for that money. Then it won\u0027t be such fun. I wonder what Jess\u0027ll say. She\u0027s coming home to-morrow, remember.\" \n \n \"Jess! Skiddy-me-shins! I fergot all about her!\" \n \n \"You certainly did. And you must have forgotten that it took every cent we could make and scrape together to put her through the Seminary. What will she say and think when she finds out what you have done?\" \n \n \"Don\u0027t let\u0027s tell her, Tildy. She needn\u0027t know anythin\u0027 about it.\" \n \n \"H\u0027m, that\u0027s easier said than done. You\u0027ll be the first one to tell her, Abner, when you meet her in the morning at the station.\" \n \n \"No, I won\u0027t, Tildy. Jess\u0027ll not hear it from me, blamed if she will. G\u0027long, Jerry.\" \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1683/49569.html","bookId":1171,"book":{"id":1171,"title":"The Touch of Abner","description":"简介： These words drawled slowly forth produced an immediate effect, and caused fifty people to straighten suddenly up and look enquiringly around.
