{"id":103078,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"I\n MY DEAR WORMWOOD,\n I note what you say about guiding our patient\u0027s reading and taking care that he sees a good deal of his materialist friend. But are you not being a trifle na\u0026iuml;f? It sounds as if you supposed that argument was the way to keep him out of the Enemy\u0027s clutches. That might have been so if he had lived a few centuries earlier. At that time the humans still knew pretty well when a thing was proved and when it was not; and if it was proved they really believed it. They still connected thinking with doing and were prepared to alter their way of life as the result of a chain of reasoning. But what with the weekly press and other such weapons we have largely altered that. Your man has been accustomed, ever since he was a boy, to have a dozen incompatible philosophies dancing about together inside his head. He doesn\u0027t think of doctrines as primarily \"true\" of \"false\", but as \"academic\" or \"practical\", \"outworn\" or \"contemporary\", \"conventional\" or \"ruthless\". Jargon, not argument, is your best ally in keeping him from the Church. Don\u0027t waste time trying to make him think that materialism is true! Make him think it is strong, or stark, or courageous - that it is the philosophy of the future. That\u0027s the sort of thing he cares about.\n The trouble about argument is that it moves the whole struggle onto the Enemy\u0027s own ground. He can argue too; whereas in really practical propaganda of the kind I am suggesting He has been shown for centuries to be greatly the inferior of Our Father Below. By the very act of arguing, you awake the patient\u0027s reason; and once it is awake, who can foresee the result? Even if a particular train of thought can be twisted so as to end in our favour, you will find that you have been strengthening in your patient the fatal habit of attending to universal issues and withdrawing his attention from the stream of immediate sense experiences. Your business is to fix his attention on the stream. Teach him to call it \"real life\" and don\u0027t let him ask what he means by \"real\".\n Remember, he is not, like you, a pure spirit. Never having been a human (Oh that abominable advantage of the Enemy\u0027s!) you don\u0027t realise how enslaved they are to the pressure of the ordinary. I once had a patient, a sound atheist, who used to read in the British Museum. One day, as he sat reading, I saw a train of thought in his mind beginning to go the wrong way. The Enemy, of course, was at his elbow in a moment. Before I knew where I was I saw my twenty years\u0027 work beginning to totter. If I had lost my head and begun to attempt a defence by argument I should have been undone. But I was not such a fool. I struck instantly at the part of the man which I had best under my control and suggested that it was just about time he had some lunch. The Enemy presumably made the counter-suggestion (you know how one can never quite overhear What He says to them?) that this was more important than lunch. At least I think that must have been His line for when I said \"Quite. In fact much too important to tackle it the end of a morning\", the patient brightened up considerably; and by the time I had added \"Much better come back after lunch and go into it with a fresh mind\", he was already half way to the door. Once he was in the street the battle was won. I showed him a newsboy shouting the midday paper, and a No. 73 bus going past, and before he reached the bottom of the steps I had got into him an unalterable conviction that, whatever odd ideas might come into a man\u0027s head when he was shut up alone with his books, a healthy dose of \"real life\" (by which he meant the bus and the newsboy) was enough to show him that all \"that sort of thing\" just couldn\u0027t be true. He knew he\u0027d had a narrow escape and in later years was fond of talking about \"that inarticulate sense for actuality which is our ultimate safeguard against the aberrations of mere logic\". He is now safe in Our Father\u0027s house.\n You begin to see the point? Thanks to processes which we set at work in them centuries ago, they find it all but impossible to believe in the unfamiliar while the familiar is before their eyes. Keep pressing home on him the ordinariness of things. Above all, do not attempt to use science (I mean, the real sciences) as a defence against Christianity. They will positively encourage him to think about realities he can\u0027t touch and see. There have been sad cases among the modern physicists. If he must dabble in science, keep him on economics and sociology; don\u0027t let him get away from that invaluable \"real life\". But the best of all is to let him read no science but to give him a grand general idea that he knows it all and that everything he happens to have picked up in casual talk and reading is \"the results of modem investigation\". Do remember you are there to fuddle him. From the way some of you young fiends talk, anyone would suppose it was our job to teach!\n Your affectionate uncle\n SCREWTAPE \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-screwtape-letters/page-2.html","bookId":2637,"book":{"id":2637,"title":"The Screwtape Letters","description":"Storyline: \n A masterpiece of satire, this classic has entertained and enlightened readers the world over with its sly and ironic portrayal of human life from the vantage point of Screwtape, a senior tempter in the service of \"Our Father Below.\" At once wildly comic, deadly serious, and strikingly original, C. S. Lewis gives us the correspondence of the worldly-wise old devil to his nephew Wormwood, a novice demon in charge of securing the damnation of an ordinary young man. The Screwtape Letters is the most engaging and humorous account of temptation—and triumph over it—ever written. \n Now, for the first time, The Screwtape Letters is presented with its full text alongside helpful annotations provided by Lewis enthusiast and dramatist Paul McCusker. The notes include literary, theological, and biographical information to enhance Lewis\u0027s core themes and demystify complex ideas. McCusker also guides readers to concepts and references from the beloved author\u0027s other treasured volumes to deepen and enrich this timeless classic. The annotated edition is the ultimate guide for understanding the heavenly truths buried in these epistles from below.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-screwtape-letters.jpg","author":"C.
