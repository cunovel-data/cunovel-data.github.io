{"id":103092,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"XVI\\n\\n MY DEAR WORMWOOD,\\n\\n You mentioned casually in your last letter that the patient has continued to attend one church, and one only, since he was converted, and that he is not wholly pleased with it. May I ask what you are about? Why have I no report on the causes of his fidelity to the parish church? Do you realise that unless it is due to indifference it is a very bad thing? Surely you know that if a man can\u0027t be cured of churchgoing, the next best thing is to send him all over the neighbourhood looking for the church that \"suits\" him until he becomes a taster or connoisseur of churches.\\n\\n The reasons are obvious. In the first place the parochial organisation should always be attacked, because, being a unity of place and not of likings, it brings people of different classes and psychology together in the kind of unity the Enemy desires. The congregational principle, on the other hand, makes each church into a kind of club, and finally, if all goes well, into a coterie or faction. In the second place, the search for a \"suitable\" church makes the man a critic where the Enemy wants him to be a pupil. What He wants of the layman in church is an attitude which may, indeed, be critical in the sense of rejecting what is false or unhelpful, but which is wholly uncritical in the sense that it does not appraise - does not waste time in thinking about what it rejects, but lays itself open in uncommenting, humble receptivity to any nourishment that is going. (You see how grovelling, how unspiritual, how irredeemably vulgar He is!) This attitude, especially during sermons, creates the condition (most hostile to our whole policy) in which platitudes can become really audible to a human soul. There is hardly any sermon, or any book, which may not be dangerous to us if it is received in this temper. So pray bestir yourself and send this fool the round of the neighbouring churches as soon as possible. Your record up to date has not given us much satisfaction.\\n\\n The two churches nearest to him, I have looked up in the office. Both have certain claims. At the first of these the Vicar is a man who has been so long engaged in watering down the faith to make it easier for supposedly incredulous and hard-headed congregation that it is now he who shocks his parishioners with his unbelief, not vice versa. He has undermined many a soul\u0027s Christianity. His conduct of the services is also admirable. In order to spare the laity all \"difficulties\" he has deserted both the lectionary and the appointed psalms and now, without noticing it, revolves endlessly round the little treadmill of his fifteen favourite psalms and twenty favourite lessons. We are thus safe from the danger that any truth not already familiar to him and to his flock should over reach them through Scripture. But perhaps bur patient is not quite silly enough for this church - or not yet?\\n\\n At the other church we have Fr. Spike. The humans are often puzzled to understand the range of his opinions - why he is one day almost a Communist and the next not far from some kind of theocratic Fascism - one day a scholastic, and the next prepared to deny human reason altogether - one day immersed in politics, and, the day after, declaring that all states of us world are equally \"under judgment\". We, of course, see the connecting link, which is Hatred. The man cannot bring himself to teach anything which is not calculated to mock, grieve, puzzle, or humiliate his parents and their friends. A sermon which such people would accept would be to him as insipid as a poem which they could scan. There is also a promising streak of dishonesty in him; we are teaching him to say \"The teaching of the Church is\" when he really means \"I\u0027m almost sure I read recently in Maritain or someone of that sort\". But I must warn you that he has one fatal defect: he really believes. And this may yet mar all.\\n\\n But there is one good point which both these churches have in common - they are both party churches. I think I warned you before that if your patient can\u0027t be kept out of the Church, he ought at least to be violently attached to some party within it. I don\u0027t mean on really doctrinal issues; about those, the more lukewarm he is the better. And it isn\u0027t the doctrines on which we chiefly depend for producing malice. The real fun is working up hatred between those who say \"mass\" and those who say \"holy communion\" when neither party could possibly state the difference between, say, Hooker\u0027s doctrine and Thomas Aquinas\u0027, in any form which would hold water for five minutes. And all the purely indifferent things - candles and clothes and what not - are an admirable ground for our activities. We have quite removed from men\u0027s minds what that pestilent fellow Paul used to teach about food and other unessentials - namely, that the human without scruples should always give in to the human with scruples. You would think they could not fail to see the application. You would expect to find the \"low\" churchman genuflecting and crossing himself lest the weak conscience of his \"high\" brother should be moved to irreverence, and the \"high\" one refraining from these exercises lest he should betray his \"low\" brother into idolatry. And so it would have been but for our ceaseless labour. Without that the variety of usage within the Church of England might have become a positive hotbed of charity and humility,\\n\\n Your affectionate uncle\\n\\n SCREWTAPE\\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-screwtape-letters/page-17.html","bookId":2637,"book":{"id":2637,"title":"The Screwtape Letters","description":"Storyline: A masterpiece of satire, this classic has entertained and enlightened readers the world over with its sly and ironic portrayal of human life from the vantage point of Screwtape, a senior tempter in the service of \"Our Father Below.\" At once wildly comic, deadly serious, and strikingly original, C.
