{"id":96187,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"On one wall of the cave there was a drawing. It was vaguely oval, with three little extensions at the top-the middle one slightly the largest of the three-and three at the bottom, the middle one of these slightly longer and more pointed. A child\u0027s drawing of a turtle. “Of course he\u0027ll go to Ephebe,” said a mask. “He won\u0027t dare not to. He\u0027ll have to dam the river of truth, at its source.” “We must bail out what we can, then,” said another mask. “We must kill Vorbis!” “Not in Ephebe. When that happens, it must happen here. So that people will know. When we\u0027re strong enough.” “Will we ever be strong enough?” said a mask. Its owner clicked his knuckles nervously. “Even the peasants know there\u0027s something wrong. You can\u0027t stop the truth. Dam the river of truth? Then there are leaks of great force. Didn\u0027t we find out about Murduck? Hah! \u0027Killed in Ephebe,\u0027 Vorbis said.” “One of us must go to Ephebe and save the Master. If he really exists.” “He exists. His name is on the book.” “Didactylos. A strange name. It means Two-Fingered, you know.” “They must honor him in Ephebe.” “Bring him back here, if possible. And the Book.” One of the masks seemed hesitant. His knuckles clicked again. “But will people rally behind . . . a book? People need more than a book. They\u0027re peasants. They can\u0027t read.” “But they can listen!” “Even so . . . they need to be shown . . . they need a symbol . . .” “We have one!” Instinctively, every masked figure turned to look at the drawing on the wall, indistinct in the firelight but graven on their minds. They were looking at the truth, which can often impress. “The Turtle Moves!” “The Turtle Moves!” “The Turtle Moves!” The leader nodded. “And now,” he said, “we will draw lots . . .” The Great God Om waxed wroth, or at least made a spirited attempt. There is a limit to the amount of wroth that can be waxed one inch from the ground, but he was right up against it. He silently cursed a beetle, which is like pouring water onto a pond. It didn\u0027t seem to make any difference, anyway. The beetle plodded away. He cursed a melon unto the eighth generation, but nothing happened. He tried a plague of boils. The melon just sat there, ripening slightly. Just because he was temporarily embarrassed, the whole world thought it could take advantage. Well, when Om got back to his rightful shape and power, he told himself, Steps would be Taken. The tribes of Beetles and Melons would wish they\u0027d never been created. And something really horrible would happen to all eagles. And . . . and there would be a holy commandment involving the planting of more lettuces . . . By the time the big boy arrived back with the waxy-skinned man, the Great God Om was in no mood for pleasantries. Besides, from a tortoise-eye viewpoint even the most handsome human is only a pair of feet, a distant pointy head, and, somewhere up there, the wrong end of a pair of nostrils. “What\u0027s this?” he snarled. “This is Brother Nhumrod,” said Brutha. “Master of the novices. He is very important.” “Didn\u0027t I tell you not to bring me some fat old pederast!” shouted the voice in his head. “Your eyeballs will be spitted on shafts of fire for this!” Brutha knelt down. “I can\u0027t go to the High Priest,” he said, as patiently as possible. “Novices aren\u0027t even allowed in the Great Temple except on special occasions. I\u0027d be Taught the Error of My Ways by the Quisition if I was caught. It\u0027s the Law.” “Stupid fool!” the tortoise shouted. Nhumrod decided that it was time to speak. “Novice Brutha,” he said, “for what reason are you talking to a small tortoise?” “Because- Brutha paused. ”Because it\u0027s talking to me . . . isn\u0027t it?\" Brother Nhumrod looked down at the small, one-eyed head poking out of the shell. He was, by and large, a kindly man. Sometimes demons and devils did put disquieting thoughts in his head, but he saw to it that they stayed there and he did not in any literal sense deserve to be called what the tortoise called him which, in fact, if he had heard it, he would have thought was something to do with feet. And he was well aware that it was possible to hear voices attributed to demons and, sometimes, gods. Tortoises was a new one. Tortoises made him feel worried about Brutha, whom he\u0027d always thought of as an amiable lump who did, without any sort of complaint, anything asked of him. Of course, many novices volunteered for cleaning out the cesspits and bull cages, out of a strange belief that holiness and piety had something to do with being up to your knees in dirt. Brutha never volunteered, but if he was told to do something he did it, not out of any desire to impress, but simply because he\u0027d been told. And now he was talking to tortoises. “I think I have to tell you, Brutha,” he said, “that it is not talking.” “You can\u0027t hear it?” “I cannot hear it, Brutha.” “It told me it was . . .” Brutha hesitated. “It told me it was the Great God.” He flinched. Grandmother would have hit him with something heavy now. “Ah. Well, you see, Brutha,” said Brother Nhumrod, twitching gently, “this sort of thing is not unknown among young men recently Called to the Church. I daresay you heard the voice of the Great God when you were Called, didn\u0027t you? Mmm?” Metaphor was lost on Brutha. He remembered hearing the voice of his grandmother. He hadn\u0027t been Called so much as Sent. But he nodded anyway. “And in your . . . enthusiasm, it\u0027s only natural that you should think you hear the Great God talking to you,” Nhumrod went on. The tortoise bounced up and down. “Smite you with thunderbolts!” it screamed. “I find healthy exercise is the thing,” said Nhumrod. “And plenty of cold water.” “Writhe on the spikes of damnation!” Nhumrod reached down and picked up the tortoise, turning it over. Its legs waggled angrily. “How did it get here, mmm?” “I don\u0027t know, Brother Nhumrod,” said Brutha dutifully. “Your hand to wither and drop off!” screamed the voice in his head. “There\u0027s very good eating on one of these, you know,” said the master of novices. He saw the expression on Brutha\u0027s face. “Look at it like this,” he said. “Would the Great God Om”-holy horns-“ever manifest Himself in such a lowly creature as this? A bull, yes, of course, an eagle, certainly, and I think on one occasion a swan . . . but a tortoise?” “Your sexual organs to sprout wings and fly away!” “After all,” Nhumrod went on, oblivious to the secret chorus in Brutha\u0027s head, “what kind of miracles could a tortoise do? Mmm?” “Your ankles to be crushed in the jaws of giants!” “Turn lettuce into gold, perhaps?” said Brother Nhumrod , in the jovial tones of those blessed with no sense of humor. “Crush ants underfoot? Ahaha.” “Haha,” said Brutha dutifully. “I shall take it along to the kitchen, out of your way,” said the master of novices. “They make excellent soup. And then you\u0027ll hear no more voices, depend upon it. Fire cures all Follies, yes?” “Soup?” “Er . . .” said Brutha. “Your intestines to be wound around a tree until you are sorry!” Nhumrod looked around the garden. It seemed to be full of melons and pumpkins and cucumbers. He shuddered. “Lots of cold water, that\u0027s the thing,” he said. “Lots and lots.” He focused on Brutha again. “Mmm?” He wandered off toward the kitchens. The Great God Om was upside down in a basket in one of the kitchens, half-buried under a bunch of herbs and some carrots. An upturned tortoise will try to right itself firstly by sticking out its neck to its fullest extent and trying to use its head as a lever. If this doesn\u0027t work it will wave its legs frantically, in case this will rock it upright. An upturned tortoise is the ninth most pathetic thing in the entire multiverse. An upturned tortoise who knows what\u0027s going to happen to it next is, well, at least up there at number four. The quickest way to kill a tortoise for the pot is to plunge it into boiling water. Kitchens and storerooms and craftsmen\u0027s workshops belonging to the Church\u0027s civilian population honeycombed the Citadel.[4] This was only one of them, a smoky-ceilinged cellar whose focal point was an arched fireplace. Flames roared up the flue. Turnspit dogs trotted in their treadmills. Cleavers rose and fell on the chopping blocks. Off to one side of the huge hearth, among various other blackened cauldrons, a small pot of water was already beginning to seethe. “The worms of revenge to eat your blackened nostrils!” screamed Om, twitching his legs violently. The basket rocked. A hairy hand reached in and removed the herbs. “Hawks to peck your liver!” A hand reached in again and took the carrots. “Afflict you with a thousand cuts!” A hand reached in and took the Great God Om. “The cannibal fungi of-!” “Shut up!” hissed Brutha, shoving the tortoise under his robe. He sidled toward the door, unnoticed in the general culinary chaos. One of the cooks looked at him and raised an eyebrow. “Just got to take this back,” Brutha burbled, bringing out the tortoise and waving it helpfully. “Deacon\u0027s orders.” The cook scowled, and then shrugged. Novices were regarded by one and all as the lowest form of life, but orders from the hierarchy were to be obeyed without question, unless the questioner wanted to find himself faced with more important questions like whether or not it is possible to go to heaven after being roasted alive. When they were out in the courtyard Brutha leaned against the wall and breathed out. “Your eyeballs to-!” the tortoise began. “One more word,” said Brutha, “and it\u0027s back in the basket.” The tortoise fell silent. “As it is, I shall probably get into trouble for missing Comparative Religion with Brother Whelk,” said Brutha. “But the Great God has seen fit to make the poor man shortsighted and he probably won\u0027t notice I\u0027m not there, only if he does I shall have to say what I\u0027ve done because telling lies to a Brother is a sin and the Great God will send me to hell for a million years.” “In this one case I could be merciful,” said the tortoise. “No more than a thousand years at the outside.” “My grandmother told me I shall go to hell when I die anyway,” said Brutha, ignoring this. “Being alive is sinful. It stands to reason, because you have to sin every day when you\u0027re alive.” He looked down at the tortoise. “I know you\u0027re not the Great God Om”-holy horns-“because if I was to touch the Great God Om”-holy horns-“my hands would burn away. The Great God would never become a tortoise, like Brother Nhumrod said. But it says in the Book of the Prophet Cena that when he was wandering in the desert the spirits of the ground and the air spoke unto him, so I wondered if you were one of those.”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/small-gods-discworld-13/page-5.html","bookId":1629,"book":{"id":1629,"title":"Small Gods (Discworld #13)","description":"Storyline: Small Gods (Discworld #13) Just because you can\u0027t explain it, doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s a miracle.\u0027 Religion is a controversial business in the Discworld.
