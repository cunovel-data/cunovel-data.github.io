Everything was shades of gray. And the cobbles under his hand had somehow become a coarse black sand. He looked up. ON YOUR FEET, PRIVATE ICHLOS. He stood up sheepishly. Now he was more than just a soldier, an anonymous figure to chase and be killed and be no more than a shadowy bit-player in other people\u0027s lives. Now he was Dervi Ichlos, aged thirtyeight, comparatively blameless in the general scheme of things, and dead. He raised a hand to his lips uncertainly. “You\u0027re the judge?” he said. NOT ME. Ichlos looked at the sands stretching away. He knew instinctively what he had to do. He was far less sophisticated than General Fri\u0027it, and took more notice of songs he\u0027d learned in his childhood. Besides, he had an advantage. He\u0027d had even less religion than the general. JUDGEMENT IS AT THE END OF THE DESERT. Ichlos tried to smile. “My mum told me about this,” he said. “When you\u0027re dead, you have to walk a desert. And you see everything properly, she said. And remember everything right.” Death studiously did nothing to indicate his feelings either way. “Might meet a few friends on the way, eh?” said the soldier. POSSIBLY. Ichlos set out. On the whole, he thought, it could have been worse. Urn clambered across the shelves like a monkey, pulling books out of their racks and throwing them down to the floor. “I can carry about twenty,” he said. “But which twenty?” “Always wanted to do that,” murmured Didactylos happily. \"Upholding truth in the face of tyranny and so on. Hah! One man, unafraid of the- “What to take? What to take?” shouted Urn. “We don\u0027t need Grido\u0027s Mechanics,” said Didactylos. \"Hey, I wish I could have seen the look on his face! Damn good shot, considering. I just hope someone wrote down what I- “Principles of gearing! Theory of water expansion!” shouted Urn. \"But we don\u0027t need Ibid\u0027s Civics or Gnomon\u0027s Ectopia, that\u0027s for sure- “What? They belong to all mankind!” snapped Didactylos. “Then if all mankind will come and help us carry them, that\u0027s fine,” said Urn. “But if it\u0027s just the two of us, I prefer to carry something useful.” “Useful? Books on mechanisms?” “Yes! They can show people how to live better!” “And these show people how to be people,” said Didactylos. \"Which reminds me. Find me another lantern. I feel quite blind without one- The Library door shook to a thunderous knocking. It wasn\u0027t the knocking of people who expected the door to be opened. \"We could throw some of the others into the- The hinges leapt out of the walls. The door thudded down. Soldiers scrambled over it, swords drawn. “Ah, gentlemen,” said Didactylos. “Pray don\u0027t disturb my circles.” The corporal in charge looked at him blankly, and then down at the floor. “What circles?” he said. “Hey, how about giving me a pair of compasses and coming back in, say, half an hour?” “Leave him, corporal,” said Brutha. He stepped over the door. “I said leave him.” \"But I got orders to- “Are you deaf? If you are, the Quisition can cure that,” said Brutha, astonished at the steadiness of his own voice. “You don\u0027t belong to the Quisition,” said the corporal. “No. But I know a man who does,” said Brutha. “You are to search the palace for books. Leave him with me. He\u0027s an old man. What harm can he do?” The corporal looked hesitantly from Brutha to his prisoners. “Very good, corporal. I will take over.” They all turned. “Did you hear me?” said Sergeant Simony, pushing his way forward. \"But the deacon told us- “Corporal?” “Yes, sergeant?” “The deacon is far away. I am right here.” “Yes, sergeant.” Go. “Yes, sergeant.” Simony cocked an ear as the soldiers marched away. Then he stuck his sword in the door and turned to Didactylos. He made a fist with his left hand and brought his right hand down on it, palm extended. “The Turtle Moves,” he said. “That all depends,” said the philosopher, cautiously. “I mean I am . . . a friend,” he said. “Why should we trust you?” said Urn. “Because you haven\u0027t got any choice,” said Sergeant Simony briskly. “Can you get us out of here?” said Brutha. Simony glared at him. “You?” he said. “Why should I get you out of here? You\u0027re an inquisitor!” He grasped his sword. Brutha backed away. “I\u0027m not!” “On the ship, when the captain sounded you, you just said nothing,” said Simony. “You\u0027re not one of us.” “I don\u0027t think I\u0027m one of them, either,” said Brutha. “I\u0027m one of mine.” He gave Didactylos an imploring look, which was a wasted effort, and turned it towards Urn instead. “I don\u0027t know about this soldier,” he said. “All I know is that Vorbis means to have you killed and he will burn your Library. But I can help. I worked it out on the way here.” “And don\u0027t listen to him,” said Simony. He dropped on one knee in front of Didactylos, like a supplicant. “Sir, there are . . . some of us . . . who know your book for what it is . . . see, I have a copy . . .” He fumbled inside his breastplate. “We copied it out,” said Simony. “One copy! That\u0027s all we had! But it\u0027s been passed around. Some of us who could read, read it to the others! It makes so much sense!” “Er . . .” said Didactylos. “What?” Simony waved his hands in excitement. “Because we know it-I\u0027ve been to places that-it\u0027s true! There is a Great Turtle. The turtle does move! We don\u0027t need gods!” “Urn? No one\u0027s stripped the copper off the roof, have they?” said Didactylos. “Don\u0027t think so.” “Remind me not to talk to this chap outside, then.” “You don\u0027t understand!” said Simony. “I can save you. You have friends in unexpected places. Come on. I\u0027ll just kill this priest . . .” He gripped his sword. Brutha backed away. “No! I can help, too! That\u0027s why I came. When I saw you in front of Vorbis I knew what I could do!” “What can you do?” sneered Urn. “I can save the Library.” “What? Put it on your back and run away?” sneered Simony. “No. I don\u0027t mean that. How many scrolls are there?” “About seven hundred,” said Didactylos. “How many of them are important?” “All of them!” said Urn. “Maybe a couple of hundred,” said Didactylos, mildly. “Uncle! ” “All the rest is just wind and vanity publishing,” said Didactylos. “But they\u0027re books!” “I may be able to take more than that,” said Brutha slowly. “Is there a way out?” “There . . . could be,” said Didactylos. “Don\u0027t tell him!” said Simony. “Then all your books will burn,” said Brutha. He pointed to Simony. “He said you haven\u0027t got a choice. So you haven\u0027t got anything to lose, have you?” \"He\u0027s a- Simony began. “Everyone shut up,” said Didactylos. He stared past Brutha\u0027s ear. “There may be a way out,” he said. “What do you intend?” “I don\u0027t believe this!” said Urn. “There\u0027s Omnians here and you\u0027re telling them there\u0027s another way out!” “There\u0027s tunnels all through this rock,” said Didactylos. “Maybe, but we don\u0027t tell people!” “I\u0027m inclined to trust this person,” said Didactylos. “He\u0027s got an honest face. Speaking philosophically.” “Why should we trust him?” “Anyone stupid enough to expect us to trust him in these circumstances must be trustworthy,” said Didactylos. “He\u0027d be too stupid to be deceitful.” “I can walk out of here right now,” said Brutha. “And where will your Library be then?” “You see?” said Simony. “Just when things apparently look dark, suddenly we have unexpected friends everywhere,” said Didactylos. “What is your plan, young man?” “I haven\u0027t got one,” said Brutha. “I just do things, one after the other.” “And how long will doing things one after another take you?” “About ten minutes, I think.” Simony glared at Brutha. “Now get the books,” said Brutha. “And I shall need some light.” “But you can\u0027t even read!” said Urn. “I\u0027m not going to read them.” Brutha looked blankly at the first scroll, which happened to be De Chelonian Mobile. “Oh. My god,” he said. “Something wrong?” said Didactylos. “Could someone fetch my tortoise?” Simony trotted through the palace. No one was paying him much attention. Most of the Ephebian guard was outside the labyrinth, and Vorbis had made it clear to anyone who was thinking of venturing inside just what would happen to the palace\u0027s inhabitants. Groups of Omnian soldiers were looting in a disciplined sort of way. Besides, he was returning to his quarters. There was a tortoise in Brutha\u0027s room. It was sit?ting on the table, between a rolled-up scroll and a gnawed melon rind and, insofar as it was possible to tell with tortoises, was asleep. Simony grabbed it without ceremony, rammed it into his pack, and hur?ried back towards the Library. He hated himself for doing it. The stupid priest had ruined everything! But Didactylos had made him promise, and Didactylos was the man who knew the Truth. All the way there he had the impression that someone was trying to attract his attention. “You can remember them just by looking?” said Urn. “Yes.” “The whole scroll?” “Yes.” “I don\u0027t believe you.” “The word LIBRVM outside this building has a chip in the top of the first letter,\u0027 said Brutha. ”Xeno wrote Reflections, and old Aristocrates wrote Platitudes, and Didactylos thinks Ibid\u0027s Discourses are bloody stupid. There are six hundred paces from the Tyrant\u0027s throne room to the Library. There is a- “He\u0027s got a good memory, you\u0027ve got to grant him that,” said Didactylos. “Show him some more scrolls.” “How will we know he\u0027s remembered them?” Urn demanded, unrolling a scroll of geometrical theorems. “He can\u0027t read! And even if he could read, he can\u0027t write! ” “We shall have to teach him.” Brutha looked at a scroll full of maps. He shut his eyes. For a moment the jagged outline glowed against the inside of his eyelids, and then he felt them settle into his mind. They were still there somewhere-he could bring them back at any time. Urn unrolled another scroll. Pictures of animals. This one, drawings of plants and lots of writing. This one, just writing. This one, triangles and things. They settled down in his memory. After a while, he wasn\u0027t even aware of the scroll unrolling. He just had to keep looking.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/small-gods-discworld-13/page-27.html","bookId":1629,"book":{"id":1629,"title":"Small Gods (Discworld #13)","description":"Storyline: Small Gods (Discworld #13) Just because you can\u0027t explain it, doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s a miracle.\u0027 Religion is a controversial business in the Discworld.
