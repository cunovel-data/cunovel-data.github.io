Brutha stared at the globe\n -a sphere of radius r, which therefore had a volume V \u003d (4/3)(pi) rrr, and surface area A \u003d 4(pi) rr-\n “Oh, my god . . .”\n “What now?” said the voice of the tortoise.\n Didactylos\u0027s face turned towards Brutha, who was clutching at his head.\n “What\u0027s a pi?”\n Didactylos reached out a hand and steadied Brutha.\n “What\u0027s the matter?” said Om.\n “I don\u0027t know! It\u0027s just words! I don\u0027t know what\u0027s in the books! I can\u0027t read!”\n “Getting plenty of sleep is vital,” said Om. “It builds a healthy shell.”\n Brutha sagged to his knees in the rocking boat. He felt like a householder coming back unexpectedly and finding the old place full of strangers. They were in every room, not menacing, but just filling the space with their thereness.\n “The books are leaking!”\n “I don\u0027t see how that can happen,” said Didactylos. “You said you just looked at them. You didn\u0027t read them. You don\u0027t know what they mean.”\n “They know what they mean!”\n “Listen. They\u0027re just books, of the nature of books,” said Didactylos. “They\u0027re not magical. If you could know what books contained just by looking at them, Urn there would be a genius.”\n “What\u0027s the matter with him?” said Simony.\n “He thinks he knows too much.”\n “No! I don\u0027t know anything! Not really know,” said Brutha. “I just remembered that squids have an internal cartilaginous support!”\n “I can see that would be a worry,” said Simony. “Huh. Priests? Mad, the lot of them.”\n “No! I don\u0027t know what cartilaginous means!”\n “Skeletal connective tissue,” said Didactylos. “Think of bony and leathery at the same time.”\n Simony snorted. “Well, well,” he said, “we live and learn, just like you said.”\n “Some of us even do it the other way round,” said Didactylos.\n “Is that supposed to mean something?”\n “It\u0027s philosophy,” said Didactylos. “And sit down, boy. You\u0027re making the boat rock. We\u0027re overloaded as it is.”\n “It\u0027s being buoyed upward by a force equal to the weight of the displaced fluid,” muttered Brutha, sagging.\n “Hmm?”\n “Except that I don\u0027t know what buoyed means.”\n Urn looked up from the sphere. “We\u0027re ready to start again,” he said. “Just bale some water in here with your helmet, mister.”\n “And then we shall go again?”\n “Well, we can start getting up steam,” said Urn. He wiped his hands on his toga.\n “Y\u0027know,” said Didactylos, “there are different ways of learning things. I\u0027m reminded of the time when old Prince Lasgere of Tsort asked me how he could become learned, especially since he hadn\u0027t got any time for this reading business. I said to him, `There is no royal road to learning, sire,\u0027 and he said to me, `Bloody well build one or I shall have your legs chopped off. Use as many slaves as you like.\u0027 A refreshingly direct approach, I always thought. Not a man to mince words. People, yes. But not words.”\n “Why didn\u0027t he chop your legs off?” said Urn.\n “I built him his road. More or less.”\n “How? I thought that was just a metaphor.”\n “You\u0027re learning, Urn. So I found a dozen slaves who could read and they sat in his bedroom at night whispering choice passages to him while he slept.”\n “Did that work?”\n “Don\u0027t know. The third slave stuck a six-inch dagger in his ear. Then after the revolution the new ruler let me out of prison and said I could leave the country if I promised not to think of anything on the way to the border. But I don\u0027t believe there was anything wrong with the idea in principle.”\n Urn blew on the fire.\n “Takes a little while to heat up the water,” he explained.\n Brutha lay back in the bow again. If he concentrated, he could stop the knowledge flowing. The thing to do was avoid looking at things. Even a cloud-\n -devised by natural philosophy as a means of occasioning shade on the surface of the world, thus preventing overheating-\n -caused an intrusion. Om was fast asleep.\n Knowing without learning, thought Brutha. No. The other way round. Learning without knowing . . .\n Nine-tenths of Om dozed in his shell. The rest of him drifted like a fog in the real world of the gods, which is a lot less interesting than the three-dimensional world inhabited by most of humanity.\n He thought: we\u0027re a little boat. She\u0027ll probably not even notice us. There\u0027s the whole of the ocean. She can\u0027t be everywhere.\n Of course, she\u0027s got many believers. But we\u0027re only a little boat . . .\n He felt the minds of inquisitive fishes nosing around the end of the screw. Which was odd, because in the normal course of things fishes were not known for their-\n “Greetings,” said the Queen of the Sea.\n “Ah.”\n “I see you\u0027re still managing to exist, little tortoise.” “Hanging in there,” said Om. “No problems.”\n There was a pause which, if it were taking place between two people in the human world, would have been spent in coughing and looking embarrassed. But gods are never embarrassed.\n “I expect,” said Om guardedly, “you are looking for your price.”\n “This vessel and everyone in it,” said the Queen. “But your believer can be saved, as is the custom.”\n “What good are they to you? One of them\u0027s an atheist.”\n “Hah! They all believe, right at the end.”\n “That doesn\u0027t seem . . .” Om hesitated. “Fair?”\n Now the Sea Queen paused.\n “What\u0027s fair?”\n “Like . . . underlying justice?” said Om. He wondered why he said it.\n “Sounds a human idea to me.”\n “They\u0027re inventive, I\u0027ll grant you. But what I meant was . . . I mean . . . they\u0027ve done nothing to deserve it.”\n “Deserve? They\u0027re human. What\u0027s deserve got to do with it?”\n Om had to concede this. He wasn\u0027t thinking like a god. This bothered him.\n “It\u0027s just . . .”\n “You\u0027ve been relying on one human for too long, little god.”\n “I know. I know.” Om sighed. Minds leaked into one another. He was seeing too much from a human point of view. \"Take the boat, then. If you must. I just wish it was-\n “Fair?” said the Sea Queen. She moved forward. Om felt her all around him.\n “There\u0027s no such thing,” she said. “Life\u0027s like a beach. And then you die.”\n Then she was gone.\n Om let himself retreat into the shell of his shell.\n “Brutha?”\n “Yes?”\n “Can you swim?”\n The globe started to spin.\n Brutha heard Urn say, “There. Soon be on our way.”\n “We\u0027d better be.” This was Simony. “There\u0027s a ship out there.”\n “This thing goes faster than anything with sails or oars.”\n Brutha looked across the bay. A sleek Omnian ship was passing the lighthouse. It was still a long way off, but Brutha stared at it with a dread and expectation that magnified better than telescopes.\n “It\u0027s moving fast,” said Simony. “I don\u0027t understand it?-there\u0027s no wind.”\n Urn looked round at the flat calm.\n “There can\u0027t be wind there and not here,” he said.\n “I said, can you swim?” The voice of the tortoise was insistent in Brutha\u0027s head.\n “I don\u0027t know,” said Brutha.\n “Do you think you could find out quickly?”\n Urn looked upwards.\n “Oh,” he said.\n Clouds had massed over the Unnamed Boat. They were visibly spinning.\n “You\u0027ve got to know!” shouted Om. “I thought you had a perfect memory!”\n “We used to splash around in the big cistern in the village,” whispered Brutha. “I don\u0027t know if that counts!”\n Mist whipped off the surface of the sea. Brutha\u0027s ears popped. And still the Omnian ship came on, flying across the waves.\n \"What do you call it when you\u0027ve got a dead calm surrounded by winds- Urn began.\n “Hurricane?” said Didactylos.\n Lightning crackled between sky and sea. Urn yanked at the lever that lowered the screw into the water. His eyes glowed almost as brightly as the lightning.\n “Now there\u0027s a power,” he said. “Harnessing the lightning! The dream of mankind!”\n The Unnamed Boat surged forward.\n “Is it? It\u0027s not my dream,” said Didactylos. “I always dream of a giant carrot chasing me through a field of lobsters.”\n “I mean metaphorical dream, master,” said Urn.\n “What\u0027s a metaphor?” said Simony.\n Brutha said, “What\u0027s a dream?”\n A pillar of lightning laced the mist. Secondary lightnings sparked off the spinning globe.\n “You can get it from cats,” said Urn, lost in a philosophical world, as the Boat left a white wake behind it. “You stroke them with a rod of amber, and you get tiny lightnings . . . if I could magnify that a million times, no man would ever be a slave again and we could catch it in jars and do away with the night . . .”\n Lightning struck a few yards away.\n “We\u0027re in a boat with a large copper ball in the middle of a body of salt water,” said Didactylos. “Thanks, Urn.”\n “And the temples of the gods would be magnificently lit, of course,” said Urn quickly.\n Didactylos tapped his stick on the hull. “It\u0027s a nice idea, but you\u0027d never get enough cats,” he said. The sea surged up.\n “Jump into the water!” Om shouted.\n “Why?” said Brutha.\n A wave almost overturned the boat. Rain hissed on the surface of the sphere, sent up a scalding spray.\n “I haven\u0027t got time to explain! Jump overboard! It\u0027s for the best! Trust me!”\n Brutha stood up, holding the sphere\u0027s framework to steady himself.\n “Sit down!” said Urn.\n “I\u0027m just going out,” said Brutha. “I may be some time.”\n The boat rocked under him as he half-jumped, half-fell into the boiling sea.\n Lightning struck the sphere.\n As Brutha bobbed to the surface he saw, for a moment, the globe glowing white-hot and the Unnamed Boat, its screw almost out of the water, skimming away through the mists like a comet. It vanished in the clouds and rain. A moment later, above the noise of the storm, there was a muffled “boom.”\n Brutha raised his hand. Om broke the surface, blowing seawater out of his nostrils.\n “You said it would be for the best!” screamed Brutha.\n “Well? We\u0027re still alive! And hold me out of the water! Tortoises can\u0027t swim!”\n “But they might be dead!”\n “Do you want to join them?”\n A wave submerged Brutha. For a moment the world was a dark green curtain, ringing in his ears.\n “I can\u0027t swim with one hand!” he shouted, as he broke surface again.\n “We\u0027ll be saved! She wouldn\u0027t dare!”\n “What do you mean?”\n Another wave slapped at Brutha, and suction dragged at his robes. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/small-gods-discworld-13/page-30.html","bookId":1629,"book":{"id":1629,"title":"Small Gods (Discworld #13)","description":"Storyline: \n Small Gods (Discworld #13) \n Just because you can\u0027t explain it, doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s a miracle.\u0027 Religion is a controversial business in the Discworld.
