It should\u0027ve been impossible for me to find, but I found it. Weeks and weeks after the fact. I did a terrible thing and I get to wear it on my wrist. And I guess I sort of hope there will be more of these kinds of things here, waiting for me to find them even though I know, logically, there won\u0027t be. Still, I have to come out and look because the feeling that there might be won\u0027t go away until I do.\\n\\n And then it goes away.\\n\\n Until it comes again.\\n\\n Monday, my foot feels fine. I stave off zoning out on the bus just so I can see Jake get on. Our eyes meet when he climbs aboard. He shrugs his book bag over his shoulder and it kind of seems like he\u0027s going to say something, but he doesn\u0027t. He finds his spot in the middle.\\n\\n \"Got a dog, huh?\"\\n\\n I pause and look down at Chris. He looks up at me. His math homework is open on his desk, half done. He pulls out the chair beside him.\\n\\n \"I saw your parents walking it. Sit.\"\\n\\n I raise an eyebrow. \"Sit?\"\\n\\n \"Would you please sit down?\"\\n\\n I toss my books on the desk and do as I\u0027m told. \"I\u0027m so behind in math,\" I say, staring at his book. \"A full unit behind, almost two. I haven\u0027t even bothered trying to catch up. Maybe I\u0027ll just drop out. It\u0027d save me the trouble of working this hard to graduate.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s always one option,\" Chris says. \"Heard you fell out of a tree last Friday.\"\\n\\n \"Heard you were at Finn\u0027s. High times?\"\\n\\n \"Not all visits to Finn\u0027s end in drug use. There were a lot of us there. Just shot the shit, introduced Jake to some people. Good party, I guess.\"\\n\\n \"You used to throw good parties.\"\\n\\n \"Didn\u0027t I, though.\" He looks away. \"I could get used to Becky. I was thinking about it. Wouldn\u0027t be so bad. Just for senior year.\"\\n\\n \"Lucky Becky.\"\\n\\n \"Like I said, I\u0027m thinking about it. It\u0027s ill-befitting someone of my popularity to go as long as I have single, which is your fault.\"\\n\\n \"You think you can make me feel guilty?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m trying.\"\\n\\n Just like that, I\u0027m tired of this conversation. I grab my books and stand even though it\u0027s not like I have somewhere else to go. The bell will ring in ten minutes.\\n\\n But in ten minutes I could be far away.\\n\\n \"Sit,\" he says again. I sit and reach for his pencil. Twirl it between my fingers.\\n\\n \"You can\u0027t make me feel guilty,\" I tell him. \"About any of it.\"\\n\\n And now it\u0027s not just about Becky anymore.\\n\\n He opens his mouth and closes it. Opens it. Closes it again.\\n\\n \"Or sorry,\" I add. \"You can\u0027t make me sorry about any of it either.\"\\n\\n \"Okay,\" Chris says, \"but whether or not you\u0027re sorry or guilty doesn\u0027t change the fact that I forgive you anyway. And I don\u0027t blame you.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, you do.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"You do. You\u0027re just saying that because you want to--\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t blame you, Parker. You weren\u0027t thinking clearly--\"\\n\\n \"Why are we talking about this?\"\\n\\n I have no patience for this kind of bullshit. It\u0027s like now that I\u0027m seeing Grey everyone\u0027s all, Oh, she must have her head on straight, so I can move in again, which is what I was afraid of, but no one gets to move in ever again because it\u0027s better for everyone this way. People are so stupid. They don\u0027t even know when you\u0027re helping them.\\n\\n \"You brought it up,\" he says, and then he smiles. \"You know, we could work something out. You be my girlfriend again, I give you my math homework...\"\\n\\n \"Right.\"\\n\\n \"Okay, skip the girlfriend thing and let\u0027s make it sexual favors.\"\\n\\n I can\u0027t tell if he\u0027s serious or not.\\n\\n \"Do I look that cheap to you?\" I ask.\\n\\n When Becky enters the room, he moves to the back to sit beside her. \"WIN OR LOSE!\\n\\n IT\u0027S ALL THE SAME!\\n\\n WE DO OUR BEST!\\n\\n WE\u0027VE GOT GAME!\"\\n\\n I\u0027m dreaming again. I pinch myself. Ouch. Not dreaming. It\u0027s lunchtime in the gym and Becky is actually leading the cheerleading squad in that stupid cheer.\\n\\n \"--Unity and disparity. I\u0027ve been thinking about this a lot and I\u0027m totally confused--\"\\n\\n \"Did you hear that?\u0027\\n\\n Jake looks up from his spot beside me on the bleachers.\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"The cheer about losing. Did you hear it?\"\\n\\n \"Uh, not really,\" he says, annoyed. \"See, I was talking about our art project--\"\\n\\n \"Shut up; they\u0027re doing it again. Listen. It\u0027s really awful.\"\\n\\n The girls resume triangle formation, Becky at the point of it.\\n\\n \"One, two, three!\"\\n\\n The cheer starts up again. Jake and I watch, transfixed. The beat is painfully off, the dance steps contrived and awkward. Cardboard cutouts of cheerleaders operated by arthritic monkeys would move more fluidly.\\n\\n They finish and Jake--bless his heart--says, \"Yeah, that was pretty bad.\"\\n\\n \"You suck, Becky!\" I shout.\\n\\n The cheerleaders twitter. Becky places her hands on her hips and turns to me. I\u0027ve heard around the halls there\u0027s nothing more terrifying than being glared at by St. Peter\u0027s High\u0027s cheerleading captain, but that was when I was the captain.\\n\\n When Becky glares, it\u0027s just funny.\\n\\n \"There was a reason I wouldn\u0027t let us do that cheer, you know,\" I say.\\n\\n She frowns.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not captain anymore. You don\u0027t get a say in it.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, and you might not be captain for much longer. They\u0027ll oust you from the squad if you perform that at the next game.\"\\n\\n The girls twitter some more, but I can\u0027t tell if it\u0027s agreeable twittering. They should know from past experience I\u0027m always right about stuff like this.\\n\\n Becky orders them to take a break and storms up the bleachers to me.\\n\\n \"Uh-oh...,\" Jake says under his breath.\\n\\n \"Fuck off, Parker,\" Becky says when she reaches me. \"That\u0027s my squad out there. My squad. Not yours, mine. How dare you humiliate me in front of the girls--\"\\n\\n I burst out laughing.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s an awful cheer and you know it. You think you\u0027ll prove me wrong by performing it? You think I actually care? Because I don\u0027t--\"\\n\\n \"Then why did you feel the need to mouth off while we were practicing it? You wouldn\u0027t have tolerated that from anyone, and if I remember correctly, you didn\u0027t--\"\\n\\n \"Jessie would\u0027ve vetoed that in a second if she was here, and she did the last time you tried to get us to do it. Remember?\"\\n\\n \"Jessie\u0027s not here, you bitch.\"\\n\\n She storms back down the bleachers.\\n\\n \"Becky, I lied!\" I yell. She doesn\u0027t turn around. \"I do care. The squad will look like total douche bags if they perform that cheer.\"\\n\\n She returns to the girls. I rest my chin in my hands.\\n\\n \"Are you ready to talk about our project now?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" I say.\\n\\n \"Okay, good,\" Jake says exasperatedly. \"So basically, Norton is fucked. Unity and disparity is... ridiculous. But I was thinking we should do one side really, really, really dark and the other side really, really, really light--\"\\n\\n \"But how do you connect that? It has to connect in the middle.\"\\n\\n \"Right. Damn it.\" He groans and stares longingly at the game of basketball Chris \u0026 Co. are having on the court.\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s make it subtle,\" I say. \"Maybe one side can be spring and the middle can be summer and the other side can be fall...\"\\n\\n Jake nods eagerly. \"I like that!\"\\n\\n \"Oh, really? I thought you wouldn\u0027t. We can\u0027t do that. That\u0027s what Mindy Andrews and Cory Hall are doing. I overheard them.\"\\n\\n He rolls his eyes and checks out the cheerleaders.\\n\\n \"Do you miss it?\" he asks.\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n It\u0027s not true. I kind of miss cheerleading sometimes. The squad. Just for something to do, to distract myself with. I know they don\u0027t miss me. I was a nightmare captain and they had to be perfect. But I was like that about everything. My grades, my relationship with Chris, my friends. Everything perfect.\\n\\n The bell rings.\\n\\n \"You didn\u0027t get to play,\" I say.\\n\\n Jake sighs. \"Yeah.\"\\n\\n \"You should try out for the team.\"\\n\\n \"Can\u0027t. My knee\u0027s all fucked up. I hurt it during the most important game of the season at my old school. Little games at lunch are about all I can stand. I miss it a lot.\" He sounds wistful. \"I love basketball.\"\\n\\n Great. Just more useless information I won\u0027t be able to forget.\\n\\n SEVEN\\n\\n By Wednesday, word around the halls is Chris and Becky are a couple. By Thursday, it\u0027s confirmed. They\u0027ve got the Public Displays of Affection thing down pat and I have to hand it to them, they look pretty happy for two people who have absolutely nothing to be happy about. He\u0027s with her because he can\u0027t be with me and she\u0027s got to suffer every kiss knowing that, and boy, does she know that.\\n\\n By Thursday night, Bailey knows how to fetch Dad\u0027s slippers.\\n\\n \"Look at this!\" Dad says, after he calls Mom and me into the living room. He\u0027s stretched out in his recliner and Bailey\u0027s sprawled out on the floor at his feet. Dad snaps his fingers. \"Bailey!\"\\n\\n Bailey raises his head.\\n\\n \"Fetch, Bailey; fetch me my slippers, boy!\"\\n\\n It\u0027s terribly exciting. Bailey rises slowly, totters out of the room and totters back in with Dad\u0027s slippers in his mouth. Mom squeals a little and claps her hands.\\n\\n This dog is mad talented.\\n\\n \"Good dog!\" she gushes, patting Bailey on the head. He looks pretty satisfied with himself, for a dog. He nestles back into his spot at Dad\u0027s feet and Mom rushes into the kitchen to get him a treat.\\n\\n \"Good job, Bailey,\" I say.\\n\\n But I\u0027m not talking about the slippers.\\n\\n The party starts at eight, but I show up early so Chris and I can have sex. Another year at St. Peter\u0027s is almost behind us and we\u0027ve already slept together eight times. This will be the ninth and there\u0027s going to be a lot more sex in our future. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cracked-up-to-be/page-9.html","bookId":1897,"book":{"id":1897,"title":"Cracked Up To Be","description":"Storyline: When \"Perfect\" Parker Fadley starts drinking at school and failing her classes, all of St. Peter\u0027s High goes on alert.
