I rip my English binder and pencil case from my locker and find the page Becky gave me with the assignment on it.\\n\\n Write a thousand-word essay comparing how you relate to \"The Yellow Wallpaper\" as a senior to how you related to the story as a freshman.\\n\\n My headache flares up. I press my palms against my eyes and try to wish, wish, wish myself out of this situation.\\n\\n A thousand words?\\n\\n I sit down, my back against my locker, and glare at the opposite wall, right into the eyes of Jessica Wellington. Jessie. Her photograph, anyway. I forgot. Four years, two suicides, one death, one rape, two pregnancies (one abortion), three overdoses and one missing person. Jessica Wellington. Since late junior year. Just up and ran away.\\n\\n I\u0027d give anything to be her right now.\\n\\n So it\u0027s one missed essay. What\u0027s the worst they could do? Maybe I\u0027ll cry in front of Lerner. He hates that. He grants extensions at the drop of a hat if girly tears are involved. It\u0027s what he\u0027s famous for.\\n\\n \"Parker?\"\\n\\n Chris. He sits beside me, arm close enough to touch mine. I resist the urge to flee. I can\u0027t stand being around him in class, but it\u0027s easier than being around him alone.\\n\\n \"Didn\u0027t you get enough of me in homeroom?\" I ask.\\n\\n \"Are you okay? Your exit from the gym was... startling.\"\\n\\n \"I forgot to do an essay for Lerner over the weekend, which wouldn\u0027t be that big of a deal if it wasn\u0027t a point against me graduating with the rest of you at the end of the year.\"\\n\\n \"Bet you wish you hadn\u0027t gotten drunk on Sunday now.\"\\n\\n I bat my eyelashes at him. \"Chris, I believe you don\u0027t feel sorry for me.\"\\n\\n \"I think you do it to yourself.\"\\n\\n \"Of course I do.\" I should at least be trying for a thousand words, but I don\u0027t. I just sit there while he stares at me. \"What?\"\\n\\n \"You were right.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m right about lots of things. Be more specific.\"\\n\\n \"Becky\u0027s not you and that\u0027s why I don\u0027t want to date her again.\"\\n\\n I laugh.\\n\\n \"Many girls aren\u0027t me. You\u0027d better get used to it.\"\\n\\n \"Can\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"Why? I did awful things to you and I\u0027d do them all over again.\"\\n\\n He winces. \"I don\u0027t think you meant them.\"\\n\\n \"I meant them.\"\\n\\n \"You know, that `94 issue of Cosmopolitan didn\u0027t have anything in it about G-spots,\" he says. \"But I should\u0027ve figured you were lying.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, you should\u0027ve.\"\\n\\n \"But Becky does know where it is.\" My mouth drops open. I try to recover, but it\u0027s too late; Chris saw it. I don\u0027t know why I expected Becky to tell me something like that. He smiles. \"Doesn\u0027t bother you, does it?\" \"No.\" I swallow. \"Okay, so why exactly can\u0027t you go out on a second date? If it doesn\u0027t bother you that she\u0027s not me when you fuck her, I don\u0027t see why you can\u0027t--\"\\n\\n He holds up his hand. \"We didn\u0027t fuck.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, I see. Congratulations.\"\\n\\n \"Where do you think she is?\"\\n\\n \"What are you talking about?\"\\n\\n He nods at the poster of Jessica. \"Where do you think she is?\"\\n\\n \"Dead,\" I say. \"Either that or working as a prostitute. But probably dead.\"\\n\\n \"Nice. I can\u0027t believe you just said that.\" He blows a strand of hair out of his eyes. \"You didn\u0027t used to be this cold.\"\\n\\n \"You know, if I do my homework and I don\u0027t come to school hungover anymore, it\u0027s still going to be like this. It\u0027s not a phase, Chris. This is who I am.\"\\n\\n \"Do you ever hear yourself?\" he asks. \"You\u0027re so full of shit.\"\\n\\n \"No, I\u0027m not anymore. That\u0027s the point.\"\\n\\n He grabs my arm and leans forward, unbearably close. His lips graze my neck and get close to my mouth. I shiver.\\n\\n \"Fuck off, Chris.\"\\n\\n He lets me go and stands.\\n\\n \"Good luck with your essay.\"\\n\\n He heads back in the direction of the gym. I reopen my binder and poise my pen above the blue lines. I should at least try.\\n\\n Write a thousand-word essay comparing how you relate to \"The Yellow Wallpaper\" as a senior to how you related to the story as a freshman.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t even reread the stupid story and the only memory I have of it isn\u0027t entirely accurate, if I\u0027m to believe Becky, which in this case I do. Still, I\u0027m a fantastic liar in all other aspects of my life, so writing a thousand-word lie should be easy.\\n\\n I can do it. I can do this.\\n\\n As a freshman, I found \"The Yellow Wallpaper\" to be--\\n\\n Fuck it, I\u0027ll just cry.\\n\\n FOUR\\n\\n I\u0027m a fantastic crier. Everyone is on suicide watch.\\n\\n Plus: I don\u0027t have to do the essay.\\n\\n Minus: it landed me in Grey\u0027s office and she called my parents.\\n\\n Plus: we\u0027re getting a dog this Saturday!\\n\\n On Tuesday, Norton surprises everyone by giving us an honest-to-God project that will take up a huge chunk of our time and account for a huge chunk of our grade and I don\u0027t like him so much anymore.\\n\\n \"Two sides of the same landscape,\" he announces, standing before us like Patton. \"That\u0027s what this project is about. You\u0027ll pair up--\"\\n\\n Norton\u0027s momentarily interrupted by the sound of screeching chairs as best friends skirt close, claiming one another. You don\u0027t want to wind up with someone like me for a partner. He frowns.\\n\\n \"On second thought, I\u0027ll put you into pairs--\" Everyone groans. \"Quiet.\"\\n\\n Chris glances at me. Bet he was going to ask.\\n\\n \"Two sides of the same landscape,\" Norton repeats in his gravelly voice. \"Here\u0027s what you\u0027re going to do: You\u0027re going to arrange a time to meet with your partner to scout the local landscape and take a picture of it. You\u0027ll bring that picture to class. Are you all with me so far?\"\\n\\n I\u0027m bored already.\\n\\n \"You will, as partners, proceed to paint the left and right side of the landscape, respectively, using the photo as a reference for the base. I want you to reimagine the landscape itself. The colors, the season--turn a paradise into wasteland! There is one caveat: you and your partner must reimagine each side of your landscape independently and figure out a way to bring it together to form a whole. I want unity and disparity here, people! Surely with everything I\u0027ve taught you, you can manage that.\"\\n\\n I\u0027ve never seen Norton so excited. He\u0027s dancing on the balls of his feet and I imagine him lying awake in bed late last night, the idea coming to him like a flash of lightning. He bolts upright and shouts, Eureka! A new way to torture my second-period senior class! Or something.\\n\\n Chris raises his hand.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t get it, sir.\"\\n\\n Norton surveys the room. \"Does everyone else here get it?\"\\n\\n No one says anything. Silence is always consent.\\n\\n \"Looks like it\u0027s just you, Ellory, but at least you\u0027ll be partnered with someone who does and has the time to explain it to you slowly and repeatedly until you understand.\"\\n\\n I can\u0027t help it; I laugh. Chris glares at me and Norton starts pairing us up. Every set of names called is met with either groans of derision or happy little shrieks of joy from all sides of the room. I hold my breath, expecting Chris because it would just be my life to have to fend his lips off my neck while we scout the area and take pictures, but it\u0027s not Chris; it\u0027s Jake.\\n\\n Which seems so much more obvious in hindsight.\\n\\n \"Fadley and Gardner.\"\\n\\n \"Shit,\" Jake mutters. I waggle my eyebrows at him.\\n\\n He rests his head on the table all kill me now.\\n\\n After the bell rings, he approaches me very, very cautiously. It makes me feel very, very intimidating. I like that.\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s make this as painless as possible,\" he says. \"When do you want to start scouting out locations? Tomorrow?\"\\n\\n \"Whoa, slow down. We have to get the cameras and everything--\"\\n\\n \"I have a digital camera. We can use that; it\u0027s no problem.\"\\n\\n \"Fine, but tomorrow\u0027s still too soon.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a huge project,\" he says. \"It\u0027s probably not soon enough.\"\\n\\n I pull out my ponytail and retie it, thinking. It would\u0027ve been easier if he\u0027d volunteered to take the pictures himself, and from what he already knows about me I don\u0027t know why he didn\u0027t. A couple minutes pass.\\n\\n Jake clears his throat. \"Oh, sure, feel free to take your time. It\u0027s not like I want to eat lunch or hang in the gym or anything.\"\\n\\n So I let a couple more minutes pass.\\n\\n \"How about Friday after school?\" I finally suggest. \"I have a meeting at the guidance office last period. You can meet me there when class lets out. Bring your digital camera and get a note so you can come on my bus--\"\\n\\n \"I already go on your bus. Our bus, actually.\"\\n\\n I blink. \"You do not.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, I do,\" Jake says in a duh voice. \"Bus four-twenty-six is my bus, too. I\u0027ve been on it every day since I started here and I\u0027ve seen you on it. You sit at the front.\"\\n\\n \"This is fascinating. I never even noticed you.\"\\n\\n I try to recall the seating arrangement, but I can\u0027t. The bus is worse than school. At least at school there are a couple of places I can hide, but there\u0027s nowhere on the bus. I usually sit at the front, close my eyes and open them at my stop.\\n\\n \"Do you sit at the back?\"\\n\\n \"Near the middle,\" he says. \"Anyway, Friday\u0027s fine. See you then.\"\\n\\n Nothing happens Wednesday and almost nothing happens Thursday until I accidentally overhear Becky and Chris schedule their second date for Saturday. I make a mental note to find out the time they\u0027re taking off so I can sneak into his backyard again.\\n\\n \"You said you felt overwhelmed on Monday,\" Grey says. \"Let\u0027s talk about that.\"\\n\\n \"What else do you want me to say? I was overwhelmed.\"\\n\\n \"Actually, I was thinking `hysterical\u0027 would be a more apt description...\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cracked-up-to-be/page-6.html","bookId":1897,"book":{"id":1897,"title":"Cracked Up To Be","description":"Storyline: When \"Perfect\" Parker Fadley starts drinking at school and failing her classes, all of St. Peter\u0027s High goes on alert.
