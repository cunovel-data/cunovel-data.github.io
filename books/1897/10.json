The speakers are mounted against his window and he turns on some sweet- sounding music really low and kisses me and I kiss him back and then, I don\u0027t know, I kind of seize up. \"What\u0027s wrong?\" he asks. He\u0027s breathing heavy. We separate and I wipe my mouth. \"What have you been eating?\" \"What does it matter?\" \"Were you eating something with garlic in it? I told you not to eat garlic before you kiss me anymore. It\u0027s gross.\" He sighs. \"What\u0027s wrong, Parker?\" \"You know I hate garlic breath and you eat it anyway, that\u0027s what\u0027s wrong.\" \"That\u0027s not what I mean.\" I untie my ponytail and retie it. I think every so often, Chris should have to work for sex by listening to me. \"Jessie thinks I\u0027m coming down on the other girls too hard.\" \"We stopped making out for that?\" He leans in for another kiss and I push him away. \"Fuck off, Chris. I\u0027m serious.\" \"You\u0027re always serious.\" \"You say that like it\u0027s a bad thing.\" \"It can be.\" He flops back on his bed. \"You should loosen the fuck up every once in a while; the world wouldn\u0027t stop. No one would die.\" He\u0027s such a bastard. I loosen up, sometimes. And even if I didn\u0027t, it\u0027s not like there\u0027s something wrong with being focused. Some people are focused. That\u0027s what they do. \"She says I\u0027m coming down on the girls too hard,\" I repeat. \"Is she right?\" he asks. \"I bet she\u0027s right.\" \"I may have let them know how much they suck lately.\" The memory of their total suckiness gets me pissed off about it all over again. \"But I want us to be good, you know? Is that too much to ask? I work my ass off thinking up cheers and dance moves and if they can\u0027t get them right, what, I\u0027m supposed to congratulate them for it?\" Chris stares. \"It\u0027s just cheerleading.\" \"Oh, really? And if I said that about one of your basketball games--\" \"That\u0027s different.\" He sits up and wraps an arm around me. \"I\u0027ve seen you captain. You\u0027re anal. You\u0027re anal about everything, though.\" \"I like things a certain way.\" \"You\u0027re a perfectionist. You like them perfect. There\u0027s no margin for error or you go crazy.\" \"If I can do things right, I don\u0027t see why everyone else can\u0027t.\" I untie my ponytail again and do it back up. \"She called me a Cheerleading Nazi in front of the entire squad. We got into a screaming match in front of everyone--\" \"That\u0027s so cute,\" Chris says, laughing. I glare at him and he stops. \"Look, you\u0027ll see her in a couple of hours when the party\u0027s in full swing. Get her after she\u0027s had a couple shots and she\u0027s mellow. You can make up, no biggie. You\u0027re best friends. That\u0027s what you\u0027re supposed to do.\" He kisses my neck. \"God, you\u0027re tense,\" he murmurs. \"Maybe you should quit the squad, take a break or something. You\u0027re, like, this close to the edge--\" \"That\u0027s funny, Chris,\" I interrupt. \"I\u0027m not kidding. Loosen the fuck up.\" He kisses me again and slides his hand up my shirt. \"Forget it. We\u0027ll talk about it later--\" \"No,\" I say. \"We won\u0027t.\" My hand is wet. I open my eyes, hold it out in front of me and stare. Wet. Tap, tap, tap. Rain against the window. It\u0027s raining out and my hand is wet. I sit up in bed, groggy. Is there a leak? A loud clap of thunder startles me and there\u0027s a whimper at the side of my bed. I turn on the light. Bailey. It\u0027s three in the morning and he\u0027s been cowering on the floor, licking my hand. The thunder sounds again and he cries. \"Bailey, you\u0027re not allowed in my room.\" I climb out of bed and grab him by the collar. \"Come on. Out.\" He resists. I give his collar a sharp tug and he whimpers, anticipating the next round of thunder, but he can anticipate it in Mom and Dad\u0027s room for all I care. I lead him down the hall. Their door is closed, of course. I let go of his collar. \"Stay,\" I say firmly. He stays. I head back to my room and crawl back into bed. The storm picks up. Every so often I hear Bailey whimpering and pawing at Mom and Dad\u0027s door and pretty soon I accept the fact I\u0027m never getting to sleep again, so I get out of bed and find Bailey curled up in a terrified ball at the end of the hall. I slip my finger under his collar and we head downstairs to the living room. A flash of lightning reveals Dad\u0027s armchair. I let Bailey go, grab an afghan and wrap myself in it. The dog sits beside me, frightened out of his mind. I reach out and run my hand over his head. I might scratch him behind the ears if I\u0027m feeling particularly inspired. The thunder goes again and again and he shakes and cries. \"It\u0027s fine, Bailey,\" I say. \"Don\u0027t be such a wimp. It\u0027s only a storm.\" I wake up to Mom and Dad hovering over me. Bailey\u0027s asleep at my feet and-- Mom\u0027s holding the camera. \"You didn\u0027t,\" I say. \"That\u0027s one for the photo albums!\" Dad winks at me. \"You\u0027d better hurry, Parker. You\u0027ll be late for school.\" I hate my parents. Chris and Becky enter homeroom joined at the hip and I make a gagging noise when they sit behind me, just because I can. Becky\u0027s still sore at me about cheerleading practice, so she calls me a bitch and excuses herself for the washrooms to confer about it with whatever minion she\u0027s got stationed there. I turn to Chris as soon as she\u0027s gone. \"I\u0027ve been thinking about the offer you made,\" I say. \"About math.\" He straightens. \"Yeah?\" \"I\u0027m game if you are.\" He looks around the room to make sure no one\u0027s overheard. \"Becky can\u0027t ever know,\" he says, an odd gravity to his voice. \"We\u0027ll see.\" \"Parker.\" \"Becky can\u0027t ever know.\" I hold up my hand. Scout\u0027s Honor. \"Got it.\" He frowns. \"Meet me in the guys\u0027 change room at lunch.\" \"That soon, huh?\" \"Just in case you change your mind.\" Becky comes back five minutes later and Chris wraps his arms around her and they start sucking face. I know he\u0027s trying to make a statement, but I have no idea what that statement is. Bradley breaks them up when the Pledge of Allegiance starts, and we all stand, hands to hearts, hands to hearts--hands always to our hearts. \"If I tell you something about me, will you tell me something about you?\" Jake and I are sitting close, trying to sketch out the landscape in pencil before we start working with paint. Norton advises us to plan everything down to the most painstakingly minute details. It should be days turning into weeks before we get to the actual painting, he says. I think he doesn\u0027t want us to finish anytime soon, lest he be forced to think up new ways to occupy a class full of eighteen-year-olds. Either that or this is one of his cruel tricks where he waits until we\u0027re good and relaxed and tells us, whoops, his mistake, the project is actually due tomorrow and still counts for half our grades. That\u0027s the kind of teacher Norton is. \"No.\" I\u0027ve been tracing the same rocks for the last thirty minutes. \"Come on,\" Jake says. \"I\u0027m going to make you tolerate me if it kills me. Or you. Preferably you. But we should get to know each other on some level or else it will be impossible to work on this together.\" \"I don\u0027t know; it\u0027s working okay so far. And besides, what about you could I possibly want to know?\" \"Try me. I will hold nothing back.\" I decide to shock him into silence. \"Which do you prefer: top or bottom?\" His mouth drops open a little and I go back to my rocks. Mission accomplished. \"Up,\" he says unexpectedly. \"Against the wall.\" I laugh, my pencil hovering above the paper. \"Right.\" \"Top.\" I glance at him. \"Really?\" \"With my last girlfriend,\" he says. \"More often than not.\" \"Sure. She still in the picture, this last girlfriend?\" \"Dumped me when I told her I was moving.\" \"Ouch.\" \"Eh.\" Jake shrugs and works on the base of a tree stump. \"We were together too long. How long were you and Chris together?\" \"Why would I tell you that?\" \"Because we agreed--\" \"No, we didn\u0027t.\" His eyebrows come together as he replays the conversation in his head and realizes I\u0027m right, but I decide to go ahead and share because what I\u0027ve chosen to share might make him realize I\u0027m not a person worth getting to know. Get him off my back. \"Actually, Chris and I were together since the ninth grade. We broke up after I stole about three hundred dollars from his savings account. Let that be a lesson to you, Jake: never give your high school sweetheart your PIN number, no matter how many times you\u0027ve had sex or been Winter Ball King and Queen.\" And that\u0027s not even the worst thing I\u0027ve done. Jake studies me. \"Wow,\" he finally says. \"Why\u0027d you do that?\" \"Gambling addiction,\" I say without missing a beat. \"I spent all my money and some of his betting on horses and racked up a little debt. After a while Chris goes, `Look, Parker, I\u0027m not giving you any more money!\u0027 So I stole it from him.\" \"Actually, she ran away from home.\" I plaster a bright smile on my face before turning around. \"Chris!\" I say, all exaggerated cheer when I do. \"And just how long have you been standing there?\" \"Obviously long enough!\" he says with a similarly exaggeratedly cheerful voice. He pushes past me, for Jake. \"Anyway, Jake, I\u0027m not going to be in the gym at lunch, so take center. Tell the guys I said you could. Aaron will want it, but I want to make Aaron cry like a little bitch for being such an asshole last Thursday.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cracked-up-to-be/page-10.html","bookId":1897,"book":{"id":1897,"title":"Cracked Up To Be","description":"Storyline: When \"Perfect\" Parker Fadley starts drinking at school and failing her classes, all of St. Peter\u0027s High goes on alert.
