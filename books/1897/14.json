How must that feel? How does it feel to know that even at my worst, you\u0027re still not enough?\" \"Fuck you.\" She turns this hideous shade of red and her hands start shaking because the truth hurts. \"Parker, I could make your life seriously miserable from where I\u0027m standing.\" \"Becky, you\u0027re only standing there because I decided I didn\u0027t want to.\" \"Holy shit,\" the same basketball player repeats behind me. I clear my throat. \"Parker,\" Evan says nervously. He runs a hand over his prickly black hair and holds out a bottle of vodka and a shot glass. \"Uh--shot?\" Jenny Morse flees from the room. I take the bottle and the glass. \"Wow,\" I say. \"This is so interesting.\" I move to the kitchen counter, pour my first shot and knock it back. It burns going down and I have to make a concentrated effort not to choke. Chris says it\u0027s pathetic that after three years of high school I haven\u0027t mastered the taste of alcohol. Chris says I should loosen up. \"You and Jessie made it up yet? Because she feels terrible about what happened at practice and she wants to make it up with you.\" The words tumble out of Evan\u0027s mouth and I can\u0027t tell if he\u0027s lying. I pour my second shot, which is really stupid because it\u0027s not even dark out yet and it\u0027s the kind of thing I wouldn\u0027t let Chris get away with. Evan watches. Hesitates. \"You\u0027re not going to tell her, are you?\" I shrug. He takes the vodka from me and pours himself a shot. Knocks it back. Then another. And another. \"I can\u0027t believe you,\" I say, reclaiming the bottle. I don\u0027t even bother to pour a shot this time, just drink it straight. It\u0027s gross, but Chris says I should loosen the fuck up. \"I thought you loved her.\" \"Oh my God, I do,\" he says desperately. \"Seriously, look, Jenny doesn\u0027t mean anything to me; she\u0027s just--\" \"She\u0027s just a lay, right?\" He doesn\u0027t say anything. \"I knew it. I totally knew it. I had a feeling and I was right. I\u0027m always right.\" He\u0027s sweating now. \"You\u0027re not going to tell her, are you?\" \"I haven\u0027t decided yet.\" I leave him there. When I step into the foyer more and more people are arriving and Chris has the music going proper, really loud. It\u0027s in my feet, up my legs, in my lungs, my heart. The party has begun. \"Do you want to go to the mall with me?\" Jake glances over his shoulder. \"Are you talking to me?\" He\u0027s such a dork. \"Yes, Jake, I\u0027m talking to you.\" \"Me? Go to the mall with you?\" He frowns. \"Why?\" I don\u0027t have the patience for this. \"Because it\u0027s fun! I don\u0027t know, why do people go to the mall? I just thought since I was going to the mall after school and you\u0027re practically stalking me all the time, you\u0027d probably wonder why I didn\u0027t get on the bus and spend all night obsessing over it, and I don\u0027t want to be responsible if you don\u0027t get a good night\u0027s sleep.\" \"You\u0027re having a rough day, aren\u0027t you?\" he asks. \"Everyone\u0027s talking about what happened at lunch.\" I inhale slowly through my teeth. \"Look, do you want to go to the mall with me after school or not?\" \"Uh, yeah!\" Finally. He forces a smile. \"Sure.\" \"Meet me outside after the bell.\" There. I\u0027ve decided to kill as many hours as I can at the mall because I don\u0027t want to go home and face my devastated parents right away and I know the phone call from Grey will devastate them. Maybe they\u0027ll send me to an actual therapist or something; I don\u0027t know. I just don\u0027t want to go home until I absolutely have to, even if it does make everything worse, and I figure toying with Jake will be a good distraction from that eventuality, because I need that, too. A distraction. \"So why\u0027d you ask me to come with you?\" The outside light and fresh air is immediately swallowed behind us as we step through the doors of the Corby Shopping Center. It\u0027s crowded, but I can stand being around this many people. It\u0027s not like school, where everyone knows me. \"Why not ask you?\" I shrug. \"Where do you want to go first?\" \"I don\u0027t know. This is my first time at your local mall. Give me the grand tour.\" \"Well, we simply must start with the food court. Does international cuisine interest you? The first slice of pizza is on me.\" \"Just a sec.\" Jake reaches out and feels my forehead. \"Temperature\u0027s normal. Invasion of the body snatchers, maybe? Have you been possessed? Remember, like, two days ago when you told me I didn\u0027t have a chance with you?\" I brush his hand away. \"First slice of pizza is on you.\" We don\u0027t have pizza, we have Chinese food and Coke on Jake at my insistence, but I think he\u0027s the type of guy who would pay anyway. The food court is really packed, so we have to eat at the fountain. We sit on the edge of the pale pink tiles while water gushes out of the mouth of the large metal fish behind us. Loose change scattered over the bottom of the fountain catches the weak light overhead and glints at us. Annoying elevator Muzak is piped in from God knows where, but hey, it\u0027s a mall. We\u0027re quiet at first and then I start thinking about my parents again, which I don\u0027t want to do, so I try for a conversation. A nice one. \"Tell me about you,\" I say. Jake takes a sip of his Coke and stares at the shoppers passing by. \"What do you want to know?\" \"Anything. Tell me about your family and life at your old school and--I don\u0027t know--what\u0027s the worst thing you\u0027ve ever done?\" He laughs at that last bit. \"Uh, my dad is Earl, my stepmom is Wanda and my stepsister is Carrie. Carrie\u0027s in her first year of college, so she\u0027s not around.\" He thinks about it. \"My dad works in tech support and Wanda does voice- overs for commercials. Pretty neat, huh? She\u0027s good, too. My mom\u0027s a zoologist. She lives way on the other side of the country.\" \"How come you don\u0027t live with her?\" He shrugs. \"I had to choose. I don\u0027t have a problem with my mom; I just have more in common with my dad. No big deal.\" That probably means it\u0027s a big deal. I take a bite of a chicken ball. It tastes like paste. \"So what\u0027s the worst thing you\u0027ve ever done?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"That must mean you\u0027re a good person.\" \"Define `worst.\u0027 Are we talking academically, socially? I cheated on every single history test I had in the ninth grade. Socially--being popular is pretty bad, isn\u0027t it?\" He cracks a smile. \"I let my friends get away with things I couldn\u0027t live with if I\u0027d been the one that did them. Or maybe I shouldn\u0027t be able to live with the fact I let them get away with that stuff, who knows?\" \"What kind of things?\" \"I don\u0027t know. What\u0027s with this question, anyway? What\u0027s the worst thing you\u0027ve ever done? That\u0027s why you asked me, isn\u0027t it? So I\u0027d ask you. I\u0027m getting a handle on you, Parker.\" \"Why do you like me? I know you like me or you wouldn\u0027t put up with me or bother me as much as you do.\" That shuts him up. But not for long. \"If I knew exactly why, I\u0027m pretty sure I\u0027d talk myself out of it.\" He clears his throat and looks away. \"I don\u0027t know if you know this, but you\u0027re not the most personable... person.\" \"And you like me.\" \"Is this going to end with you telling me I\u0027m never getting into your pants?\" \"Even after what you saw in the gym today?\" He forces himself to look at me and he\u0027s totally embarrassed. I can tell this is really hard for him and I feel sorry for him because it\u0027s really complicated and stupid when you can\u0027t even figure out why you like a person--especially a person like me--but everything inside you is telling you that you do. It\u0027s not like I ever gave him a reason. I just wouldn\u0027t want to be him right now. \"Maybe you like trying to figure me out,\" I suggest. \"So maybe I should tell you what my deal is. Get it out of your system.\" \"Maybe I like trying to figure you out because I like you against my better judgment.\" He pauses. \"Or maybe if I figured you out, I\u0027d like you more.\" \"I don\u0027t think so.\" We stare at each other. I sense the kiss coming before he actually leans in, and because I\u0027m anticipating it, I get all anxious and I start pulling at the tips of my fingers because I don\u0027t know what else to do. His face gets closer and closer and then I lose grip of my index finger and my elbow rams into his Coke and spills all over the floor. The kiss never happens. I scramble for napkins and sop up the golden- brown liquid even though a janitor will clean it up. \"Were you raped?\" I stare at him. \"What? Is that some kind of come-on?\" He\u0027s really uncomfortable now. \"I\u0027ve been trying to figure out why you\u0027re as fucked up as you claim you are. Is that what it is?\" \"No.\" I bend down and grab the empty cup. \"No, I wasn\u0027t raped.\" The city bus drops me off two blocks from home. It\u0027s dark and cold out and I make it a slow walk, even though I\u0027m tired and want to sleep. When I pass Chris\u0027s house, I notice a small sign on the lawn that wasn\u0027t there before. It\u0027s planted in front of the walk and has an air of authority despite its size. I crouch down and read it. PROTECTED BY LETHAM\u0027S HOME SURVELLIANCE AND ALARM SYSTEMS I feel like I\u0027m going to throw up. I can\u0027t see the cameras from here or the little strips of laser light that sound the alarm as soon as you trip over them, but I know they\u0027re there and just like that, I can\u0027t go into the woods anymore.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cracked-up-to-be/page-14.html","bookId":1897,"book":{"id":1897,"title":"Cracked Up To Be","description":"Storyline: When \"Perfect\" Parker Fadley starts drinking at school and failing her classes, all of St. Peter\u0027s High goes on alert.
