{"id":85983,"no":23,"title":"Page 23","content":"\\n\\n And I get the feeling by the way everyone is staring at me that I look great.\\n\\n Or a boob has popped out or my dress has split down the back.\\n\\n I spin for Jake, just to make sure.\\n\\n \"Everything in place?\"\\n\\n \"Do that again,\" he says, so I do. \"Yeah, everything\u0027s in place. Now do it again.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe later, but only if you\u0027re good.\" I scan the room. Everyone\u0027s in various stages of spaz- dancing to the spaz song piped through the mega-speakers onstage. \"I don\u0027t think I can dance the fast ones in this dress, Jake. Sorry.\" \"We could have one continuous slow dance instead.\"\\n\\n \"Now why didn\u0027t I think of that?\"\\n\\n \"Because you can\u0027t see your chest the way I\u0027m seeing your chest. It gives me thoughts...\"\\n\\n I stare at him. \"Feeling confident?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m matching wits with you or something.\"\\n\\n He smiles and holds out his hand. I take it and we step onto the dance floor and make a mockery of slow dancing by pressing up close and swaying back and forth. I rest my head on his shoulder and think of Evan, who will be here soon, and what that means and I think of Grey and all the stupid things I said to her just to get to this moment.\\n\\n He did his bit and he goes on like... before.\\n\\n Have I done my bit and that\u0027s why I\u0027m letting myself be here? The answer comes to me quickly: no. I can\u0027t lose everything I\u0027ve worked so hard to give up. I\u0027ll have to make up any good parts of the night later. So I\u0027d better enjoy myself while I still can.\\n\\n I trace a circle on the back of Jake\u0027s neck with the tip of my finger.\\n\\n \"I want to have a nice time tonight,\" I say.\\n\\n \"Me, too,\" he replies, his voice cracking. I stop tracing. \"But what\u0027s a nice night for Parker Fadley? Just so we\u0027re clear.\"\\n\\n I have to think about it. \"I won\u0027t say anything mean, you won\u0027t ask questions I don\u0027t want to answer and I might let you kiss me. You\u0027ll make me laugh at least once before the night is over, preferably by making fun of Becky. We\u0027ll dance and have punch and on Monday we won\u0027t talk about it.\"\\n\\n \"Okay.\"\\n\\n \"What about you? What makes a nice night for you?\"\\n\\n He leans his head back and stares at me. \"Everything you said, but maybe you\u0027ll tell me something that makes me understand you better, or where I stand with you better, and I\u0027d like to see where we are on Monday and go from there.\"\\n\\n \"Forget about Monday,\" I warn him.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll see.\"\\n\\n \"Please don\u0027t set yourself up for disappointment.\"\\n\\n \"Be quiet,\" he says. \"I\u0027m trying to think of something disparagingly clever to say about Becky and I\u0027m coming up short.\"\\n\\n I laugh.\\n\\n \"Wait, does that count? I made you laugh! That counts!\"\\n\\n \"You didn\u0027t make fun of Becky, though; you totally failed.\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s a bitch... face?\"\\n\\n I bite the inside of my cheek. \"Points for trying, I guess.\"\\n\\n The fast dance stops and a slow one starts, but I\u0027m tired of this, so I gently extricate myself from Jake, and we wander over to the punch, where he fills up two cups. We lean against the wall and watch Becky, Chris, their posse and the peons try to turn a poorly decorated room into an event and I try to let myself feel happy because I\u0027m not one of them anymore--but I\u0027m not really happy about it tonight. I did used to like dances. I raise the cup to my lips and sip slowly. It\u0027s just punch. Boring.\\n\\n \"Nice bracelet,\" Jake says suddenly. \"You always wear it. Was it a gift?\"\\n\\n \"Uh...\" I stare at the thin gold strand. \"Yes and no.\"\\n\\n And then my chest feels tight because of all the moments for him to bring it up, he\u0027d pick this one. I snap my fingers, desperate to head off the bad feeling before it starts.\\n\\n \"Do you want to do something fun and not allowed?\" I ask.\\n\\n He eyes me warily. \"And what would that be?\"\\n\\n I lead him around the edge of the dance floor. Grey, Henley and Bradley are clustered in one corner \"supervising.\" They should be ashamed of how easily we sneak by them and find ourselves in the middle of the darkened halls, which is against the rules.\\n\\n We have the whole school to ourselves.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s this rumor the skeleton in the lab glows in the dark,\" I lie. \"I\u0027ve always wanted to see if that\u0027s true.\"\\n\\n Jake smiles. \"Lead on.\"\\n\\n The way our footsteps echo down the hall is pleasantly creepy. When we peer into the lab, Jake notes with a hint of sadness that the skeleton doesn\u0027t actually glow. Despite this, I open the door and step inside. I love the lab. The right wall is mostly made up of windows, big ones that let in lots of light. Moonlight, in this case.\\n\\n Jake follows me in and shuts the door behind us. He wanders over and sits on top of one of the tables. I sit beside him--very carefully, so as not to break my dress--and swing my legs back and forth. It\u0027s quiet for a while, peaceful. I like that.\\n\\n Then he speaks: \"So I think I\u0027ve finally figured out why I like you.\"\\n\\n \"Do tell.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s really unoriginal, but...\" He clears his throat. \"I\u0027ve never met anyone like you before.\"\\n\\n \"Ah,\" I say. \"You\u0027re right. That is really unoriginal.\"\\n\\n \"Well, I think you\u0027re--you\u0027re not nice. And you\u0027re definitely self-absorbed, but... you interest me.\" He pauses. \"You know how when you meet someone and they just give you the impression they\u0027re living on this entirely different planet from everyone else? That\u0027s sort of how I felt when I met you. I thought, `It must be something to know the girl who tells you that you want into her pants like five minutes after she meets you.\u0027 I mean, after I stopped being pissed off.\"\\n\\n I force a smile. \"And is it something?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s difficult,\" he says. \"You\u0027re very difficult.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t mind you, Jake,\" I say after a second. \"There. That\u0027s what you get from me. And you get tonight and on Monday you get nothing.\"\\n\\n He stares at me.\\n\\n \"You really mean it, don\u0027t you?\" he asks. \"Do you think you\u0027re doing me a favor? Because-- don\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m doing us a favor. Let\u0027s get it out of our systems.\"\\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t you just want to start something with me, seriously? Like maybe a date that doesn\u0027t end weirdly, like seeing a movie...\"\\n\\n He runs a hand through his hair.\\n\\n \"Because this way is better,\" I tell him.\\n\\n \"But what if we did it and you found out you really liked me?\"\\n\\n \"I could make myself get over it.\"\\n\\n He winces. \"Do you do that a lot?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, I\u0027m great at it. And you\u0027re ruining this.\"\\n\\n \"Sorry.\" And then he kisses me, just forces his mouth against mine, and I\u0027m surprised by how rough it is, but that\u0027s fine, if that\u0027s how it has to be. I bring my hands to his face and press my fingernails into his cheeks hard, and he pushes me back against the desk and I\u0027m lying down and some small part of me thinks this is funny; we\u0027re going to do it in the lab.\\n\\n I reach down, push his jacket aside and fumble with his belt. Jake runs his hand up my thigh and nibbles my lower lip while I unbutton his pants. His fingers drift over my chest and his mouth moves down to my neck. I pause and enjoy the feeling of his lips against my skin. He\u0027s really good. And then he stops.\\n\\n \"What?\" I ask. I\u0027m short of breath; he\u0027s short of breath. He leans back, but his face is still close enough for me to give him a light kiss on the lips. \"Why are you stopping?\"\\n\\n He stares at me a long time and then he skirts off the desk, red faced, and starts buttoning and buckling up.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want to do this,\" he says. He doesn\u0027t sound like he means it.\\n\\n \"Yes, you do.\" I sit up. \"You\u0027re a guy. It\u0027s what guys do.\"\\n\\n \"Not--not...\" He takes a deep breath. \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"Because it\u0027s a bad idea,\" he says, tugging at the edges of his jacket. \"Because I don\u0027t see Monday going all that well if I fuck you in the school\u0027s science lab tonight and pretend it never happened. Which is pretty stupid, since I have a feeling this was the closest I was ever going to get.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re right,\" I say.\\n\\n He groans and rubs his eye.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re so frustrating, you know that? You want everything and none of the--are you scared?\" He shakes his head. \"Is that it? I think we could have a great time.\"\\n\\n \"We could still have a great time--\"\\n\\n \"Except forget it happened on Monday, right? And I can kiss you, but I don\u0027t know if I can hold your hand. And I can kiss you, but I can\u0027t ask you questions. Forget it, Parker. If you\u0027re too afraid to start anything, just forget it.\" Pause. \"Are you afraid?\"\\n\\n I keep my mouth shut. We crossed a line here. Even if we didn\u0027t do anything, we really crossed a line. He sighs and opens the door to the lab.\\n\\n \"Whatever,\" he says. \"We should get back.\"\\n\\n I edge off the table but make no move to leave. I feel guilty. I hate that feeling. It\u0027s like when Bailey\u0027s looking at me and he loves me and there\u0027s nothing I can do to convince him he got such a raw deal being stuck with me.\\n\\n \"Are you coming?\" He sounds impatient.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" I say. I focus on the wall above his head because I can\u0027t look him in the eyes. \"I had this plan before you got here and it\u0027s hard for me. I mean, I\u0027m afraid--\"\\n\\n I hate being honest. It feels gross.\\n\\n \"Anyway.\" I swallow. \"I am sorry.\"\\n\\n It was supposed to be a nice night.\\n\\n Sneaking back into the auditorium is slightly more complicated than sneaking out, but we manage. We head over to the uncomfortable metal chairs lined against the wall and sit down. It\u0027s hot, stuffy. I try and fail to spot Chris and Becky amid a throng of dancing students. Jake leans his head against the wall and closes his eyes.\\n\\n The music goes fast, then slow. \"Want to dance?\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cracked-up-to-be/page-23.html","bookId":1897,"book":{"id":1897,"title":"Cracked Up To Be","description":"Storyline: When \"Perfect\" Parker Fadley starts drinking at school and failing her classes, all of St. Peter\u0027s High goes on alert.
