He wraps his arms around me and our foreheads touch and I decide this is the nice moment; this is what I\u0027m allowed to have. I like the way he feels next to me, and if I were someone else I could be his girlfriend. And then I pretend to be her and tomorrow doesn\u0027t worry me; two weeks from now doesn\u0027t worry me. Everything is fine.\n And then the dance ends.\n When I get home, I realize the bracelet is gone. I imagine it slipping off my wrist in Chris\u0027s car, in the lab, on the dance floor, on the ride back.\n I cut off my hair.\n SEVENTEEN\n Evan steps into the entrance corridor like a ghost.\n People pass him without a backward glance, none of them aware of this new old addition to the halls of St. Peter\u0027s High. I watch--from a safe distance, of course--as he takes the school in like he\u0027s never seen it in his life. His hair is short, clean-cut like before, like Chris said it would be, but he\u0027s done nothing for his weight.\n Leave.\n I think it as hard as I can, but Evan\u0027s skull is so thick it\u0027ll probably never get through. Still. Leave. You\u0027re not wanted here.\n I do not want you here.\n My chest gets tight and I try to focus on all those techniques on the paper Jake gave me, but it doesn\u0027t work because I don\u0027t remember them, and besides, they\u0027d never work. When my hands start shaking, I know I have to get away. I give Evan one last look and head in the opposite direction. So I can\u0027t be around him at all; that\u0027s fine. St. Peter\u0027s is a big school. I could avoid him easily for the next few... months.\n The bottle in my locker is begging me to open it.\n But I want to graduate. I want to graduate.\n \"I want to graduate.\"\n I don\u0027t mean to say it out loud.\n \"What?\" Jake looks up from our landscape. \"What did you say?\"\n \"I want to graduate. It\u0027s my new mantra.\"\n \"Oh.\" He turns back to the paper.\n \"No congratulations? It\u0027s a very positive mantra for me.\"\n \"Nope.\"\n Things you can\u0027t do with someone without fucking up the weird enough relationship you already have:\n 1. Almost have sex with them in the school\u0027s science lab.\n 2. Give yourself a really bad haircut?\n Actually, I\u0027m not sure the haircut has anything to do with it. He hasn\u0027t said a word about it. Chris freaked, Becky laughed--she\u0027s finally better looking than I am--but Jake, Jake was quiet. He\u0027s been quiet. I can\u0027t even pretend to know what he\u0027s thinking about now and I hate that. It messes me up.\n \"Fadley! Gardner! In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when are you going to start painting that thing?\"\n I jump. Norton got us from behind. I turn and give him my sweetest smile, but he only raises one very unimpressed eyebrow at me. I think my haircut has actually compromised the manipulative properties of my face.\n \"You of all people should know real art can\u0027t be rushed, Mr. Norton,\" I say.\n \"If that is real art, Fadley,\" Norton says, nodding at our paper, \"then please direct me to that ravine so I can throw myself into it.\"\n Jake stares determinedly at our landscape. It\u0027s not that bad. \"Art is subjective,\" I remind Norton.\n \"That it is, Fadley. Nevertheless, I suggest you get a move on. Your landscapes are due at the end of this week.\"\n The room explodes. This is news to everyone. Jake\u0027s mouth drops open and several students make a mad scurry to the supply cabinet to get more paint. I ignore the voice in my head telling me to vomit. I want to graduate. I want to graduate. I want to graduate. Or else I\u0027ll be stuck here forever.\n \"Oh my!\" Norton looks around the room in mock surprise and genuine delight. Old bastard. \"Did I forget to tell all of you?\"\n \"Okay, that\u0027s it,\" Jake says. \"We need a plan and we need it now.\"\n \"I can\u0027t think,\" I say. I really can\u0027t. What if this is it? What if this is the stupid thing that keeps me from graduating? Unity, disparity. Unity. My fingers start tingling. I press my hands flat on the desk. Don\u0027t think about it.\n \"Come on, Parker,\" Jake says desperately. \"Give me something, anything.\"\n \"Jake, shut up. I can\u0027t--\"\n \"Why am I not surprised?\" he snaps.\n He wanders to the back for the paint, returning with five or six different colors, but by the time the period ends, neither of us has attempted a start.\n I zombie-walk to the gym, completely forgetting about the chapel, and when I get there the cheerleaders are preparing to practice and Evan is preparing to play basketball and everyone sees me come in, so I can\u0027t leave.\n Chris walks over.\n \"How did you get here?\"\n \"I walked,\" I murmur, staring past him. I can\u0027t lose sight. I have to fix it.\n \"Come on; let\u0027s get you back inside. You can crash in my room.\"\n \"No--\" I blink and Jessie and the guy she\u0027s with have gone. Disappeared. They were by the pool and now they\u0027re not and I haven\u0027t fixed it. I turn to Chris. \"Where did they--where did they go?\"\n \"Where did who go?\"\n \"They--\" And then this song starts up, really loud. I can\u0027t think. If I can\u0027t think, I can\u0027t find Jessie; I can\u0027t fix it. I have to find Jessie. \"Chris, this music makes me feel like, it\u0027s like--\"\n He laughs.\n \"Okay, when you start talking about how the music makes you feel, maybe it\u0027s time for you to go to bed. Come on, Parker.\"\n He tries to force me toward the house, but I jerk away.\n \"You\u0027re not listening to me! Just listen to me--\"\n \"Okay, just--it\u0027s okay.\" But he\u0027s patronizing me. He has this stupid patronizing, condescending voice on and he thinks I\u0027m too drunk to hear it.\n \"Where are--\"\n And that\u0027s when she reappears, that strange guy beside her. No. A different guy. I relax. They start dancing and she stands on her tiptoes and kisses him, this new guy, and my stomach turns because I did this.\n Evan removes himself from the basketball game before it really starts. He jogs across the gym, to the bleachers where I\u0027m sitting, and the vice around my heart gets tighter and tighter, but I think I\u0027ll be okay as long as I focus solely on breathing. But if he starts talking to me I\u0027m worried I won\u0027t be able to talk back and breathe at the same time.\n \"Hi, Parker,\" he says, sitting beside me. \"I\u0027ve been hoping to talk to you.\"\n Inhale. \"Oh?\" Exhale.\n Okay, maybe I can do this after all.\n \"Yeah. We haven\u0027t really talked. So, I mean...\" He shrugs selfconsciously. \"Like, how are you? How\u0027ve you been?\"\n Inhale. \"You\u0027re missing the basketball game.\" Exhale.\n \"Not really. I\u0027m so out of shape, passing the ball takes up most of my energy. Two minutes in and I\u0027m on my third wind.\" He cracks a smile. I edge away, but he doesn\u0027t notice. \"Not much changes at St. Peter\u0027s, huh? I mean it\u0027s like I never left.\"\n \"I wouldn\u0027t say that.\"\n \"Oh.\" That doesn\u0027t slip past him. \"Okay.\"\n \"Yeah.\"\n Oh, right--inhale. Exhale. I clench my hands into fists and glance down the court. Chris and Jake are involved in the game, but every so often one of them looks my way.\n Call Evan back. Call him back and get him away from me.\n \"Man, I was hoping it wouldn\u0027t be like this,\" he says. \"I wanted to talk to you.\"\n I close my eyes.\n \"I have nothing to say to you, Evan.\"\n \"Hey, Parker!\"\n I open my eyes. Becky\u0027s staring at me expectantly, arms crossed. I can\u0027t even begin to imagine what she could possibly want with me.\n \"What?\"\n \"Would you come down here and stand in place for Ellie? She\u0027s sick and I want to see the formation from the front without a big gaping hole in it. You don\u0027t have to do anything, just stand there.\"\n \"Sure.\"\n I jump up and jog over to the squad. The girls are already in formation. I take a quick look back and Evan\u0027s where I left him, staring at me. I don\u0027t like that.\n \"Where do you want me?\" I ask Becky.\n \"Over there, between Sarah and Hannah,\" she says, pointing. \"Are you okay?\"\n The girls stare at us, awaiting instruction. Robots.\n \"Why?\"\n \"You look weird.\" She smiles. \"And not just because of the hair.\"\n I wipe my palms on my skirt. Block it out. He\u0027s not there.\n \"As former captain, I\u0027m trying to get over my disgust that you can\u0027t use your imagination to pretend Ellie\u0027s in her usual spot,\" I say. A couple girls gasp. \"I did that for all of those practices you managed not to show up for.\"\n Becky scowls. \"Are you going to help me or not?\"\n \"Oh, I\u0027m not helping you, Becky. I\u0027m here for my own amusement.\"\n With that, I flounce into Ellie\u0027s spot, and Becky climbs a little way up the bleachers to inspect us.\n \"Okay, it\u0027s good,\" she shouts. \"Parker, stay there. The rest of you show me what victory looks like!\"\n The girls stretch their arms into the V. Evan\u0027s still looking at me. I want him to stop. They move onto the I. I glance down the court again.\n Come on, Chris. Call Evan back.\n Make him stop.\n I pull at my collar. It\u0027s hot in this gym; it\u0027s--T. O. I realize I\u0027m not breathing again. I\u0027m not breathing and it\u0027s hot. The scene turns to mush. I try to blink it back into focus. The girls are moving in slow motion but not really, but they are standing too close and if Evan doesn\u0027t stop staring at me I\u0027ll--\n \"Somebody get Henley or something.\"\n I don\u0027t want to open my eyes.\n \"Just wait. Parker? Can you hear me? Parker?\"\n I am not going to open my eyes. I\u0027m going to lie on the court until I die, and I hope that happens soon, because I want to die.\n \"Okay, someone get Henley.\"\n After a minute, I open my eyes. Chris notices first.\n \"Hey,\" he says. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cracked-up-to-be/page-24.html","bookId":1897,"book":{"id":1897,"title":"Cracked Up To Be","description":"Storyline: \n When \"Perfect\" Parker Fadley starts drinking at school and failing her classes, all of St. Peter\u0027s High goes on alert.
