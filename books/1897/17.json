Gross. \"Well, say you are asking me out. That means you\u0027d have to get off at my stop and we\u0027d go from there, right?\"\\n\\n \"It seems that would be the most convenient way to go about it.\"\\n\\n I unfold the paper in my hands. HOW TO BREATHE. I fold it back up again.\\n\\n \"You\u0027d have to meet my parents,\" I say carefully. \"I\u0027ve sort of freaked them out lately and they don\u0027t really like me going out when I can\u0027t be supervised, and since they\u0027ve never met you they\u0027d probably say no and I\u0027d probably have to be back before my curfew, which is seven thirty...\"\\n\\n I look him directly in the eyes.\\n\\n \"I mean, you know how it is. You chase a bottle of sleeping pills with a bottle of Jack Daniel\u0027s and life\u0027s never the same, no matter how many times you try to tell people it was an accident.\"\\n\\n \"Is that a no?\" he asks. \"If you don\u0027t want to, just say so. You don\u0027t have to be such a smart-ass about everything.\"\\n\\n I want to laugh, but I don\u0027t. There\u0027s something unsatisfying about what just happened here. I set the paper down.\\n\\n I could have a good time if I went out with Jake. But that doesn\u0027t mean I should.\\n\\n \"Are you asking me out?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" he finally says.\\n\\n \"Mom, Dad--this is Jake Gardner.\"\\n\\n After they get over the initial shock that I still have a friend to bring home, my parents play twenty questions with Jake. They\u0027re straight out of The Parent\u0027s Handbook and they\u0027re so standard it doesn\u0027t even matter who\u0027s asking them.\\n\\n MOM/DAD: Well, it\u0027s nice to meet you, Jake! Gardner, Gardner... that wouldn\u0027t be any relation to the Gardners down on Marriott Avenue?\\n\\n JAKE: Thanks, nice to meet you, too. It might be. See, my family just moved here from the West Coast not that long ago.\\n\\n MOM/DAD: Oh, wow! How exciting! Welcome to Corby! So how do you know Parker? Do you two share a class together?\\n\\n JAKE: We have art together. We\u0027re partnered for a big project due at the end of the year.\\n\\n MOM/DAD: Oooh. Aaah.\\n\\n At this point I go upstairs and change out of my uniform. When I go back downstairs, wearing something more casual, Jake and my parents are winding it up.\\n\\n MOM/DAD: And your parents--what do they do?\\n\\n JAKE: Well, my dad\u0027s in tech support down at that call center in Belton, my mom\u0027s a zoologist and my stepmother does voice-overs for commercials. You\u0027ve probably heard her. She did the one for those crazy mop-broom hybrids. The Bop?\\n\\n MOM/DAD: My mother-in-law loves the Bop! Wow! That\u0027s great, Jake! You\u0027re welcome here anytime!\\n\\n We decide not to go to the coffeehouse right away, opting to wait for the school day to settle first. And Bailey needs a walk, so we take him to this patch of park where people bring their dogs to interact with other people\u0027s dogs and chase Frisbees and things.\\n\\n \"Here, Bailey.\" Jake grabs a stick off the ground. Bailey hops around lightly as Jake swings it back and forth. \"Fetch, boy!\" Jake throws the stick. Bailey goes lunging after it and lets out a startled yelp when he\u0027s jerked back by the neck, and that\u0027s when I realize his leash is wrapped tightly around my hand at a painfully short length.\\n\\n \"Shit!\" I say. \"Oh, Bailey--I\u0027m sorry!\"\\n\\n He gives a pitiful whimper and I crouch down and gesture him forward. He tiptoes up to me with this big Sad Dog expression and it makes me feel guilty. I wrap my arms around his neck because I don\u0027t know how to apologize to a dog, but this one always wants me to pet him, so a hug should be, like, huge.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry, Bailey. I didn\u0027t do it on purpose.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re obviously unfamiliar with the game of fetch,\" Jake says behind me.\\n\\n I ignore him and pat Bailey on the head until he looks less pained and more adoring and for a second I think I\u0027m going to do something I haven\u0027t done--and genuinely meant--in a long time.\\n\\n Cry.\\n\\n Chris is crying over my hospital bed the second time I wake up. The first thing I think is I can\u0027t pay him back. It\u0027s the first thing I say, too.\\n\\n \"Good boy.\" Bailey wags his tail. I turn to Jake because I can\u0027t shake this stupid sad feeling in the pit of my stomach. I snap my fingers. \"Do you think he hates me for that? I mean, do you think he understands it was an accident?\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s a dog,\" Jake says. But then he looks at my face. \"But sure, yeah. I bet he understands. He\u0027s clearly smitten with you.\"\\n\\n \"Clearly,\" I echo. I shove my hands in my pockets. \"You have a lot in common with my dog!\"\\n\\n \"Har, har,\" he says, reaching for another stick.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t feel comfortable letting him off the leash,\" I say quickly, and Jake drops it and then I start feeling even worse for some reason. I shouldn\u0027t be doing this with him. I should stop. \"And I\u0027m not hungry. We should skip the coffeehouse.\"\\n\\n His face falls. \"Sure, that\u0027s fine.\"\\n\\n \"But we can still do this, though,\" I say.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s this?\"\\n\\n It\u0027s a good question. We\u0027re just standing here, Bailey sitting between us and glad to do it, but it\u0027s not really anything and Jake wants something. So I think about kissing him, but then I don\u0027t because that would be really stupid.\\n\\n \"I guess I\u0027ll just catch the bus home then, is that it?\" he asks. \"I wish you\u0027d told me you weren\u0027t really into this, Parker.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not that--\"\\n\\n \"Then what is it?\"\\n\\n \"Never mind. Let\u0027s just go to the coffeehouse.\"\\n\\n He laughs. \"Right, yeah, we\u0027ll just do that when you\u0027ve already said you don\u0027t want to. You know, this is so typical--\"\\n\\n \"No, I do! I asked you if you were asking me out and you said you were and I agreed to it, so we\u0027re going to eat and we\u0027re going to talk about our stupid art project, okay? You cancel a date before it happens, not during. So we\u0027re going to the coffeehouse. That\u0027s what we\u0027re doing.\"\\n\\n \"Fine, Parker. Whatever.\"\\n\\n We drop Bailey off at home and go to the coffeehouse and I order a bagel and a black coffee and Jake orders a chicken salad sandwich and a black coffee and neither of us says anything even though we\u0027re supposed to be talking about our art project. \"If I knew why you liked me,\" I say after the waitress drops the bill on the table, \"I could probably handle it a lot better.\"\\n\\n \"That makes two of us.\" He hesitates. \"Do you even like me at all?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. It freaks me out. I try not to think about it too much.\"\\n\\n Jake sighs, grabs the bill and stands. I do the same. And then I start thinking of the dog and I feel guilty all over again and I want it to go away and snapping my fingers doesn\u0027t help, so I do that really stupid thing.\\n\\n I lean over the table and kiss him.\\n\\n TWELVE\\n\\n Chris wants to talk.\\n\\n In homeroom, he hisses my name, but I ignore him. In art, he tries to start a conversation and I ignore him. After the bell goes, he tells me to meet him in the gym and--ignored. He either knows about Jake or wants to talk about Evan and I don\u0027t want to talk about either, so I have to find somewhere else to spend my lunch hour, somewhere that\u0027s relatively peaceful and not totally crowded.\\n\\n Like the chapel.\\n\\n Why didn\u0027t I think of it before? If I\u0027d thought of it before, I never would\u0027ve tried the nurse\u0027s office or made a habit of \"hiding out\" in the gym. The chapel. It\u0027s only a Catholic school. No one goes to the chapel.\\n\\n But I\u0027d forgotten just how awful and uncomfortable the place makes you feel until I push through the doors and step into the little God\u0027s House adjacent to the caf. It\u0027s like the walls know I\u0027m a bad person. I stand before the altar, cross myself--force of habit--and try to pick the best pew of the lot, settling for one in the middle on the left-hand side. I could sleep away my afternoon classes and no one would ever think to look for me here.\\n\\n \"Parker?\"\\n\\n I groan.\\n\\n \"Oh my God. It\u0027s true.\"\\n\\n \"Go away,\" I mutter. \"I\u0027m not talking to you.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re a mess.\"\\n\\n The thing about being drunk is people want to congratulate you for it, often in the form of giving you more to drink.\\n\\n Or maybe this anomaly is only true of people in my high school.\\n\\n Chris drags me out to the pool and for the next hour all anyone can talk about is how Perfect Parker Fadley is actually drunk, and then they slap me on the back and they say \"way to go\" all admiringly, and next thing I know, someone\u0027s pressing a red plastic cup into my hand. And because I start feeling that rush I usually feel when I\u0027ve done something perfectly and everyone knows it, I drink whatever is in the red plastic cup.\\n\\n And then I get props and another red plastic cup.\\n\\n Four or six red plastic cups later, I have:\\n\\n Danced horrendously in front of everyone, even though Chris assures me I looked sexy and plenty of guys want to \"tap\" that, nearly fallen into the pool, told several people I loved them, apologized to most of the cheerleading squad for being a Nazi--except for Becky, fallen down and cried, was helped up and laughed, threw up, cried again, told Chris I hated him for doing this to me because I was being stupid and he promised me I wouldn\u0027t and stumbled away to the front lawn, which is where I\u0027m lying now, flat on my back with perfectly manicured blades of grass pressing into my legs, hands and neck.\\n\\n Chris is probably searching for me all over the house and backyard where the party is, which is why I\u0027m out front, where the party isn\u0027t. The remaining minuscule sober part of my brain refuses to let me make a fool of myself in front of everyone any more than I already have and the remaining minuscule sober part of my brain says the only way I can do this is if I stay the fuck away from people altogether.\\n\\n \"Do you need help up?\" Jessie asks. \"If I get Evan and Chris and maybe Becky, I\u0027m sure we can drag you up to Chris\u0027s parents\u0027 bedroom.\"\\n\\n I throw my arm over my eyes.\\n\\n \"Go away.\" She doesn\u0027t. She sits down on a patch of grass close to my head. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cracked-up-to-be/page-17.html","bookId":1897,"book":{"id":1897,"title":"Cracked Up To Be","description":"Storyline: When \"Perfect\" Parker Fadley starts drinking at school and failing her classes, all of St. Peter\u0027s High goes on alert.
