Dad nods and wraps an arm around her. \"We should have had him longer.\" That\u0027s a dig at me. \"I guess it was just his time,\" Dad says after a while. \"Lucky him,\" I say. It just slips out. \"What did you say?\" Dad\u0027s voice is sharp. He gives me this look. I shrug and march away from the whole scene, but he keeps talking. \"Parker, get back here and tell me what you said--Parker!\" \"What did she say?\" Mom asks. And of course they can\u0027t just leave it at that. On Monday, on my way to catch the school bus, my little slip-of-the-tongue turns into this: \"Make sure you come straight home after school.\" I pause at the door. \"Why?\" \"Because your mother and I need to talk with you.\" Think quick, Parker. \"I can\u0027t.\" Dad lowers the paper and looks at me, like, I don\u0027t know. \"Why?\" \"I promised Becky I\u0027d give her some tips about these new cheerleading routines she\u0027s planned. She\u0027s not feeling so confident about them. And then I was going to...\" I fumble for the words. \"I was going to stay the night. I forgot to ask. Sorry.\" He frowns and thinks about it. Doesn\u0027t even notice I don\u0027t have an overnight bag or anything, but doesn\u0027t want to believe that after all this I would still lie. It\u0027s sad. \"Fine,\" he says, returning to the paper. \"Tomorrow then.\" \"Death freaks me out,\" Jake says suddenly. It\u0027s going to be one of those days. \"Thanks for sharing,\" I say. I\u0027m filling my blank sheet of paper with circles and he\u0027s drawing a tree. Art is back to normal, as in no one really cares. \"I don\u0027t know what I ever would have done had you not told me that about you.\" He frowns. \"I don\u0027t like it. It always makes me take stock. And then I have to go through this process where I have to decide how important things are and if I\u0027m doing enough about them. That freaks me out, too. Does that happen to you?... Did it happen to you?\" \"Nope.\" \"So I called my mom.\" I stop drawing and give him my full attention because if we\u0027re talking about this we\u0027re not talking about Bailey or me. \"What happened?\" He squints at his paper. \"She thought I was calling to beg to come back home. It didn\u0027t go so well when she found out I wasn\u0027t.\" \"That sucks.\" \"Yeah.\" \"So what are you going to do about it?\" \"What can I do about it?\" He shrugs. \"She\u0027s decided; I\u0027ve decided. I called her and she shut me out.\" \"Does it make you feel worse or better?\" He thinks about it for a second. \"I thought I\u0027d be happy for the closure. But it\u0027s worse, actually. I feel guilty.\" \"So what happens next?\" He shrugs again. \"I keep going from here?\" We reach for the white gummy eraser sitting between us at the same time. His hand brushes over mine and then lingers there and I freeze. \"Your hand is on my hand,\" I say in this completely stupid voice. And then Chris struts over under Norton\u0027s disapproving gaze, but since the sun is shining and it\u0027s nice out he\u0027s feeling lenient enough not to shout Chris back to his seat. \"Hey, Jake. Rain check tonight.\" \"What?\" Jake turns around. \"What the fuck?\" \"Sorry,\" Chris says, glancing at me and looking away. \"It\u0027s just that Becky\u0027s got romantic-type plans.\" I roll my eyes. Becky\u0027s idea of \"romantic\" is no underwear. \"So?\" Jake asks. \"So,\" Chris says slowly, leaning forward, \"I can either fuck Becky or dick around with you. What do you think I\u0027m going to choose?\" \"Oh, fuck off,\" Jake mutters. \"Asshole.\" Chris punches him in the arm. \"Thanks, man. I knew you\u0027d understand.\" \"You\u0027ve got until I count to three to get back to your seat, Ellory,\" Norton says lazily from the front of the room. \"One... two...\" Chris scurries away. \"Plans tonight?\" I ask. \"Not anymore,\" Jake grumbles. \"I\u0027m on a two-day vacation from my parents. It was going to be a guys\u0027 night in, blow off school tomorrow. We\u0027ve been planning it forever.\" \"Sounds pretty hot.\" \"I was hoping,\" he says, grinning. \"I mean, look at him. He\u0027s so built.\" \"You\u0027re preaching to the choir, Jake.\" We draw in silence for a little bit and I\u0027m thinking, thinking, thinking. I know how to take advantage of every situation and I\u0027ve got nowhere to sleep tonight. \"If you ask me over right now, there\u0027s a ninety percent chance I\u0027ll say yes.\" Jake stops drawing, but he doesn\u0027t look at me. \"Are you serious?\" \"Eighty. It\u0027s eighty percent now.\" Pause. \"Seventy...\" \"Come over?\" I stare at all the circles I\u0027ve drawn. \"Yeah.\" On the bus ride there\u0027s only quiet between us. Jake leads me off at his stop and we walk up Trudeau Road, to his house near the end of it. I recognize the place. It\u0027s a small bungalow with a neat front lawn and a cute little garden along the path to the front door. The shutters are faded pink. It\u0027s the kind of house that might as well have a sign that says GOOD PEOPLE LIVE HERE mounted in front of it. \"How did you finish our art project anyway?\" I ask while Jake unlocks the front door. \"What did you do in the end?\" \"Oh,\" he says, pausing. \"I painted half of it and let the other half stay unfinished. I don\u0027t think even Norton knew what he was talking about when he said all that bullshit about unity and disparity. He was just fucking with us. But he enjoyed the picture. Said the right side reminded him of you.\" I\u0027m not expecting that. \"Why?\" \"It was the unfinished side. He was totally on to us.\" I smile. \"Seriously?\" \"Yeah.\" He opens the door and steps aside. \"But he still gave us an A, so it\u0027s all good.\" The front door opens into the kitchen, which is a small, neat little room with a tiny breakfast nook that must serve as the lunch and dinner table as well. \"Nice place,\" I say automatically, because that\u0027s what you do. \"Thanks,\" Jake says. He sets his book bag on the floor, so I do the same. He makes a beeline for the fridge, totally relaxed. \"Are you thirsty? Hungry?\" \"Thirsty.\" \"Water, Coke, OJ?... Heineken?\" \"Water, thanks.\" He hands me a bottle, takes one for himself and leans against the kitchen counter, staring at me. He gets the upper hand because it\u0027s his house. I should\u0027ve thought of that before I wrangled an invitation out of him. I twist the cap off my water and sip. \"Sure you\u0027re not hungry?\" he asks after a minute. This is weird. \"I\u0027m sure.\" \"Well, I\u0027m starving and I have to do something about it.\" He heads back to the fridge, rifles through it, and pretty soon he\u0027s got all the ingredients needed to make a sandwich massive enough to feed ten men or one teenage boy. \"Hey, First Friday Mass is this Friday.\" I groan. \"Don\u0027t remind me.\" \"Yeah, tell me about it. What a waste of time.\" He looks at me. \"Is that blasphemous? I don\u0027t know how you crazy Catholics operate.\" \"It\u0027s probably blasphemous.\" He goes back to the fridge, retrieves an apple and tosses it to me. \"I never see you eat lunch,\" he says. \"Eating is good for you.\" I sit at the table and roll the apple along the varnished wood surface. \"You go to church a lot?\" he asks, throwing everything imaginable between two thin slices of bread. For the first time since we got here, he sounds awkward. I don\u0027t want things to be awkward when we have the whole evening stretched out in front of us. \"Not outside of school, no.\" It goes quiet, which makes everything else get loud. Jake finishes making his sandwich and the sound of his chewing is amplified by our silence, weirdly punctuating the moment. I stop rolling the apple and take a bite. It\u0027s so sweet, I almost gag. \"I miss my mom, though,\" Jake says randomly. \"Before my dad fucked around on her she wasn\u0027t as bitter and crazy as she is now.\" \"Gee, who would\u0027ve thought,\" I say. He laughs. \"She really thought I was going to stay with her. Like, she really--\" He breaks off and shakes his head. \"Anyway, that\u0027s the worst thing I\u0027ve done. Chose my dad.\" \"That must be a relief for you,\" I say, setting the apple on the table. \"Imagine if you\u0027d done something really, really bad.\" He stares at me, bemused. \"What\u0027s that supposed to mean?\" \"She\u0027s your mom. She\u0027ll forgive you. You\u0027ll forgive her.\" \"It could be years from now.\" \"So you lose a little time. You still get to fix it.\" He sips his water. \"What\u0027s the worst thing you\u0027ve ever done?\" \"None of your business.\" I run my finger along the ragged edges of the apple where I bit it. \"Nothing that can be fixed.\" \"It can\u0027t be that bad.\" \"You don\u0027t know that, though, do you?\" \"Okay...\" He chews his thumbnail. \"It can\u0027t be fixed, so let it go.\" \"I\u0027ll just do that.\" He\u0027s forgotten his sandwich. He tilts his head back and closes his eyes and stays that way for a minute. Then he opens his eyes and stares at me. \"How do you get to be an eighteen-year-old who\u0027s done something so unimaginably horrible it can\u0027t be fixed? I mean, seriously?\" \"Where\u0027s your bathroom?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cracked-up-to-be/page-28.html","bookId":1897,"book":{"id":1897,"title":"Cracked Up To Be","description":"Storyline: When \"Perfect\" Parker Fadley starts drinking at school and failing her classes, all of St. Peter\u0027s High goes on alert.
