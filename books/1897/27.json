I don\u0027t have a lot of time. I need-- Chris. Chris can fix this; he\u0027s rich. I run to his house and pound on the door and ring the bell at the same time and it seems like hours before the door actually opens and there he is. Chris. \"What the fuck--\" He stops, his eyes traveling from my face to my hands to my shirt. The parts of me that are red. \"Parker, what happened?\" \"My dog got hit by a car. I don\u0027t know what to do.\" He stares at me uncomprehendingly and then Jake appears behind him and gives me this surprised look and Bailey is dying. \"What\u0027s going on?\" Jake asks. I don\u0027t have time for this. I\u0027m wasting time. I run back down the driveway and they both follow after me, calling my name. But they quiet when Bailey comes into view. \"Oh God,\" Chris mutters. My pulse is in my ears, loud and insistent. When we get to Bailey, he\u0027s still. \"I\u0027m so sorry, Parker,\" Jake says. For a second, I think my heart is going to explode. But then the feeling goes away. \"This engine backfired or something; it really scared him.\" I stare at Bailey\u0027s body. It doesn\u0027t even look real. \"I wasn\u0027t holding the leash tightly enough.\" \"Did you see who did it?\" Jake asks. \"No--I thought there\u0027d be time to do something for him,\" I say stupidly. I wish his eyes would close. Bailey\u0027s. \"Sorry for dragging you out...\" \"It\u0027s okay,\" Chris says. \"No, it\u0027s not. I should really go.\" I stand and start heading down the street without looking back at either of them. I want to get far away from Bailey\u0027s body. Take a shower. Get his blood off of me. I pull at my shirt. Off of me. \"Parker, where are you going?\" I stop and turn. I hear the question, but... \"Your house is that way.\" Chris points in the opposite direction. \"I\u0027ll get there eventually.\" \"Why don\u0027t you come inside and I\u0027ll make tea or something.\" \"No thanks.\" \"I know you,\" he says. \"You won\u0027t go home.\" \"I can\u0027t go home.\" \"You can stay at my place tonight.\" No. \"You have that car show.\" \"Forget it,\" Jake says. Chris holds out his hand. \"Come on.\" \"I wasn\u0027t holding the leash tightly enough.\" I don\u0027t know why I say it again. They look at me funny. And then Chris takes me by the elbow and the three of us walk up to his house. I can\u0027t feel my feet. I can\u0027t feel my feet and the night has all caught up with me, but I soldier on. The farther I get from the house, the louder the music sounds. A heavy bass line and an earsplitting drumbeat winds its way into the woods from Chris\u0027s open bedroom window. And then there\u0027s the splashing sounds from the pool and everyone\u0027s laughing and talking and shrieking and having a good time. Because Chris\u0027s parties are the best except when they\u0027re not. Twenty-five steps into the woods, I think about lying down or turning back. I can\u0027t feel my feet, I can\u0027t feel my legs, anything, and my head is barely attached to my neck, but I\u0027ve got to fix this because I\u0027m supposed to be better than this and what if everyone finds out I\u0027m not. A few more steps. I hear something and I stop. \"Go to the guest room, take a shower and grab a nightshirt. You know where everything is,\" Chris says, closing the door behind us. \"Come down and we\u0027ll have... tea.\" \"Tea,\" I repeat faintly. \"Do you even know how to make tea?\" \"It can\u0027t be that hard,\" he says, heading for the kitchen. I go upstairs. I sit on the bed in the guest room. I don\u0027t even feel like showering anymore. I just want to sit here with Bailey\u0027s blood on me while he\u0027s splayed out on the middle of the road. He can\u0027t stay there forever. After a while, I tiptoe down the hall to Chris\u0027s parents\u0027 bedroom, steal into their bathroom and turn on the light. I stare at myself in the mirrored cabinet. I look really bad. I open the cabinet and stare at the prescription bottles inside. Chris\u0027s mom was a desperate housewife before it was cool. I grab the bottle of pills that make you happy and let you go to sleep, open it up and empty them beside the sink. I start counting them out, and when I\u0027ve done that I arrange them in neat rows of six. I can make out two shapes in the darkness, on the ground. On a bed of pine needles. My heart sinks. I inch forward quietly and hold my breath. If she\u0027s fucked him, this is--this is harder to fix. Jessie\u0027s fucking him. \"What are you doing?\" My hand jerks into the rows of pills and some of them scatter into the sink. I scramble to prevent as many of them from going down the drain as I can, but it\u0027s futile, they all go, and anyway, it doesn\u0027t matter. I start putting what\u0027s left of them back. \"Why don\u0027t you tell me what you think I\u0027m doing?\" I ask. \"I don\u0027t even want to say it.\" I rub my hands on my shirt. \"I just wanted one to sleep. Your mom has the good stuff.\" \"A whole bottle is hardly one.\" \"I wanted to pick the right one.\" \"Oh, duh. I should have known.\" \"I--\" I force myself to look Chris in the eyes. \"I have to take that shower.\" \"Fine. But if it takes longer than ten minutes I\u0027m coming back up to get you.\" I take the shower, but I make sure it\u0027s a long one just to see if he\u0027ll come in. He doesn\u0027t, like I knew he wouldn\u0027t. Because the air is different now. I\u0027m far away from the pills and they\u0027re far away from me, but Bailey\u0027s still out on the road, dead, not far away at all, and he can\u0027t stay there forever. I come out of the bathroom and change into one of the nightshirts they leave for the guests and wrap myself up in one of the guest housecoats. And then I put on my best face and head downstairs. \"--But we have to move him,\" Jake\u0027s saying. \"Should we get Parker?\" \"She\u0027s upset. We could do it for her,\" Chris says. Pause. \"I don\u0027t know. Maybe she wants to be there for it. Maybe we should get her.\" Silence. \"Well, which is it?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" Chris says again. \"I hate this.\" It gets heavy quiet. I sneak out the back door, putting as much distance as possible between me and the house. I thought I knew why I was coming out here, but now, between the road and woods, I\u0027m not so sure. I head for the woods. It\u0027s extremely quiet. No matter how close I get to all the trees, even memories of sound are hushed by the death out on the street. And then I\u0027m in the woods. In them. Just far enough in. I get down on my hands and knees and start brushing pine needles aside. Maybe the bracelet will show up again. Maybe I\u0027m supposed to lose it every so often and then I\u0027m supposed to find it again and Bailey was supposed to die because it\u0027s here for me, like it was before. And then I can wear it around my wrist, for both of them-- Bailey. I can\u0027t do this. What am I doing? I leave the woods and make my way to the road, to do what I should\u0027ve done in the first place. He\u0027s still there, all broken and stiff, and I think I hate him for it. I kneel in front of his body and rest my hand on his chest, hoping for a heartbeat even though I know there won\u0027t be one. Or maybe... I rest my head against his chest and listen. His fur is scratchy and unpleasant against my skin, not soft like it was, the blood on it caked and flaking. I close my eyes and I really listen. Come on, Bailey, you stupid dog. Come on. Please. \"Parker?\" It\u0027s Jake. \"My dog\u0027s dead,\" I say. He kneels beside me, but he doesn\u0027t say anything, so I keep talking. \"I knew this would happen.\" \"You couldn\u0027t have predicted that car.\" \"Yeah, I could have,\" I say. \"Because that\u0027s what I do to people. And now dogs. I just fuck them up. And it\u0027s always spectacular how I do it, too. But--maybe not before. I wouldn\u0027t have predicted it before. But now I can.\" He stares at me, concerned. I feel off my head. \"What do you mean?\" he asks. \"Before I thought I was above letting these kinds of things happen, but now I know that\u0027s not the truth. Now it\u0027s just a matter of time before they do. And I knew if Bailey--\" I gaze at my dog\u0027s prone form. He was my dog. \"I knew it would end like this. And here we are.\" \"Here we are.\" \"It shouldn\u0027t upset me that you guys are done with me,\" I say. \"Because that\u0027s what I want.\" \"Really,\" Jake says. \"That\u0027s what you want?\" \"Yeah. I just forget it sometimes, I guess. I don\u0027t know.\" \"You don\u0027t know?\" \"You\u0027re echoing everything I say.\" I meet his eyes and I can\u0027t believe how it wasn\u0027t that long ago he was just this new kid and I kind of scared him and somewhere along the way I got lazy and let him get close, so I guess that means he\u0027ll get hit by a car or something, too. \"I like certain things a certain way or it\u0027s not right. But I\u0027ve been forgetting.\" \"I\u0027m sorry,\" he says. \"But he was a good dog,\" I say after a minute, running my hand over Bailey\u0027s head, the way he liked it when he was alive. Alive. I swallow. \"And I have to move him. I can\u0027t leave him here.\" \"Parker, I can...\" He hesitates. \"Do you need help?\" My answer gets stuck in my throat and stays there, never passing my lips. It doesn\u0027t matter. Together, we move Bailey off the road. TWENTY Mom decides we should bury Bailey under the maple tree in the backyard. She asked me what I thought about it and I said I didn\u0027t care, but she just kept at it and kept at it and I just wanted her to shut up, so in the end I had to remind her about the time I told her I couldn\u0027t have cared less if Bailey died, and it worked. She shut up.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cracked-up-to-be/page-27.html","bookId":1897,"book":{"id":1897,"title":"Cracked Up To Be","description":"Storyline: When \"Perfect\" Parker Fadley starts drinking at school and failing her classes, all of St. Peter\u0027s High goes on alert.
