I can\u0027t bring myself to look at him. \"My skirt didn\u0027t-- it didn\u0027t, like, go up, did it?\" It takes him a minute to register that. \"You didn\u0027t flash anyone.\" \"But you do look like shit,\" a familiar voice says. Chris. I flop back on the cot. \"Where\u0027s Becky?\" I make sure to say it in a supersnotty voice, hoping it\u0027ll make him leave faster. \"Cheerleading practice.\" I can\u0027t believe he hasn\u0027t given up on her yet. He studies me and frowns. \"I had this funny thought while I was coming down here and now I have to know: is this about Evan?\" Jake looks from Chris to me. \"Who\u0027s Evan?\" \"He\u0027s--\" Chris stops abruptly, backs halfway out of the room and glances down the hall. \"Henley\u0027s coming.\" I groan. \"Someone please put me out of my misery.\" The sound of Henley\u0027s high heels clacking along the floor momentarily precedes her, and when she enters the room she\u0027s got this look that says it all: she is tired of seeing my face. The feeling is so mutual. \"I heard what happened in Mr. Norton\u0027s class,\" she says. \"Drinking in class again?\" \"No.\" \"You wouldn\u0027t be lying to me now, would you, Parker?\" I cover my face with my hands. No one says anything. I hate that Jake and Chris are hearing this because it\u0027s none of their business and Henley should know better. I bite back the urge to tell her to do her job right. \"She wasn\u0027t, Mrs. H.,\" Chris says. \"I mean, not that I could tell.\" \"Gardner?\" \"It was--\" He stops. I uncover my eyes while Jake gets all sincere on Henley. \"It was an anxiety attack. I didn\u0027t see her drinking.\" I know he thinks he\u0027s doing me a favor, so I try not to death-glare him. \"An anxiety attack?\" Henley repeats. I can\u0027t tell if she\u0027s disappointed or not. \"Well... that\u0027s something you can talk about with Ms. Grey on Friday, Parker.\" Thank you, Jake. Thank you so much. \"Now if you\u0027ll excuse me, I have to get back to the teachers\u0027 lounge.\" I snort. I bet they keep the good booze there. Henley reads my mind and glares at me, but she goes. \"So it was Evan,\" Chris says thoughtfully. He laughs, kind of. \"Jesus Christ, Parker. When do you think you\u0027ll stop kidding yourself, huh?\" \"Oh, fuck off, Chris.\" \"Who\u0027s Evan?\" Jake asks again. I lie down, turn my back to them and stare at the wall. \"Just this guy we know,\" Chris \"explains.\" \"Anyway, I\u0027d better get to the gym. Becky\u0027s waiting for me. Are you coming, man?\" \"I told the nurse I\u0027d stay here with her until he got back.\" \"All right, well. See you guys later.\" \"Chris, wait--\" I sit up. \"Since when do you have an alarm system? I saw the sign on your lawn.\" He blinks, surprised. \"Some jackasses broke my mom\u0027s favorite bird fountain.\" \"You got an alarm and surveillance system for that?\" He shrugs. \"Dad\u0027s been looking for an excuse for ages.\" Exit Chris. Jake turns back to me. \"Who\u0027s Evan?\" I stretch and yawn. \"Anyone ever tell you that you have a one-track mind?\" \"Do you want some more water or anything?\" \"No.\" \"So who\u0027s Evan?\" I gesture for him to come close. He hesitates. \"It\u0027s okay,\" I say. \"Just come here.\" He crosses the room slowly, and when he\u0027s close enough I reach out and grab his hand. He tenses. For someone who supposedly likes me, you\u0027d think he\u0027d be over the moon because I\u0027m touching him, but no, he\u0027s suspicious. I turn his palm up and trace my index finger over what I think is his life line. It\u0027s alarmingly short, if you believe that sort of stuff, and I don\u0027t. His breath catches in his throat. I hear it. I\u0027m just fucking with him. I let go of his hand and pat the spot beside me. He sits. \"I could like you, Jake.\" I can\u0027t believe I\u0027m saying it. \"But the more you know about me, the less interesting you become.\" I\u0027m not so steady on my feet. It\u0027s fifty minutes into the party and too much of the vodka is gone, and if I walk without leaning against the wall I\u0027m afraid I\u0027ll do something dumb like fall over in front of everyone. Apparently my overwhelming fear of looking sloppy and stupid in front of the entire school is not as drunk as the rest of me. Next time Chris tells me to loosen the fuck up, I\u0027m going to tell him to fuck the fuck off. And I haven\u0027t seen Chris since he got the music going. I make a mental note to talk to him about that--it\u0027s too loud. The beat makes the house rock back and forth, or that could be the vodka, I don\u0027t know. I inch my way down the hall. I\u0027m going to hide out in his parents\u0027 room and die on their bed. Someone can resurrect me in the morning. \"There you are!\" Chris yells. Great. I turn really slowly and after a second the rest of the room turns with me. \"I\u0027ve been looking for you.\" I give him a closed-mouth smile because I\u0027m afraid to talk. \"Hmm?\" \"Let\u0027s go outside; the music sounds awesome out there,\" he says. \"We can start off the poolside dancing.\" \"Uh...\" My mouth is total sandpaper, thick. \"Well--\" \"Uh, well,\" Chris says, imitating me. \"Don\u0027t think about it; let\u0027s go!\" He pulls my hand. I reach out for the stair banister to my left. \"Go without me.\" I think I sound okay. \"I\u0027m going to stay... here.\" \"What?\" \"Go; just go,\" I say slowly. Maybe he can\u0027t understand me. I can understand me. \"Without me. Poolside dance. Without me. Go.\" He stares at me for a good minute. \"Parker, are you hiding something from me?\" \"Uh--well.\" I swallow and let go of the banister, but the room lurches to the left and I have to grab it again. \"No...\" \"Okay,\" he says. Phew. Then he grins. \"Parker, you\u0027re drunk.\" \"I\u0027m--\" so not in the position to deny it, so I give him an accusing glare. \"You told me to loosen up.\" He laughs. For, like, five minutes he just stands there laughing at me. \"Not funny!\" \"It is so!\" he insists. \"You know what this means, don\u0027t you?\" I shake my head. \"It means it\u0027s now my responsibility to make sure you have the most amazingly fun drunken time of your life or I\u0027ll never hear the end of it.\" He grabs my hand again and pulls me down the hall. \"Come on! Poolside dancing!\" \"No, Chris--\" I dig my heels in. \"Chris.\" He turns. \"What?\" \"I don\u0027t want anyone to see me like this. Let me hide out in your parents\u0027 room, please--\" \"You are the most sober drunk person I know.\" He says that like it\u0027s a bad thing. \"Relax. It\u0027s a party. In another hour you\u0027re not going to be the drunkest person here. Becky will be. No one\u0027s going to think less of you.\" \"But I\u0027m cheerleading captain.\" \"So what? Come on; the fresh air will make you feel better.\" He says it with such authority I let him drag me outside. \"Besides,\" he adds, as we step through the door, \"I won\u0027t let you do anything really stupid. Look at it this way: it could be the best night of your life.\" I look up. The sun gets in my eyes. Everything goes white. ELEVEN \"I think we should talk about what happened yesterday,\" Grey says, squinting at me over her Parker notebook. I wonder what she\u0027s written about me so far and hope it\u0027s something lost cause锟統. \"Tell me what got you so upset.\" I press my lips together. \"Did someone say something to you?\" I keep my mouth shut. \"Maybe I didn\u0027t give you enough credit when you told me you felt overwhelmed. Maybe none of us did. I\u0027m sorry, Parker.\" If she seriously believes that\u0027s going to get me to talk, I\u0027m kind of offended. She sighs. \"Is this how it\u0027s going to be?\" I glance at the clock and watch the minute hand snail forward. If I wasn\u0027t so committed to this silence, I\u0027d say something like, I don\u0027t trust you, remember? \"Uh, what are you doing?\" \"What does it look like I\u0027m doing?\" Jake asks, settling into the seat beside me. The bus jerks forward. \"I\u0027m sitting beside you.\" \"No, you\u0027re not. Your seat is in the middle. Nice try, though.\" He has the audacity to ignore me, sets his book bag on his lap and rummages through it. After a minute, he pulls out a folded sheet of paper and hands it to me. I unfold it. \"A love letter? How sweet.\" \"No.\" He turns pink. \"It\u0027s just something I found on the Internet--\" \"Porn? You shouldn\u0027t have.\" \"Just shut up for five seconds. It\u0027s breathing techniques, to get a handle on your anxiety. I thought you might find them helpful.\" I stare at him and he turns even pinker. \"You know. So you don\u0027t pass out in class again--\" \"I got it, Jake. About five sentences ago.\" I know a thank-you would probably be more appropriate, but what happened yesterday continues to humiliate me, so never mind. I guess he can sit here just this once. \"Anyway, we\u0027ve really got to start thinking about our art project,\" he says. \"A lot of people have already started painting. We should probably be doing that.\" \"Got any ideas?\" I ask. I don\u0027t. I barely think about our project when we\u0027re in class working on it, let alone out of class, on my own time. \"Not a sweet fucking clue.\" And then he rushes headlong into what he says next: \"Do you want to brainstorm together at that coffeehouse on Victoria Street today, after school? It looks really good. I\u0027ve wanted to try it ever since we moved here--\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cracked-up-to-be/page-16.html","bookId":1897,"book":{"id":1897,"title":"Cracked Up To Be","description":"Storyline: When \"Perfect\" Parker Fadley starts drinking at school and failing her classes, all of St. Peter\u0027s High goes on alert.
