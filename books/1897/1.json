{"id":85961,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"ONE Imagine four years. Four years, two suicides, one death, one rape, two pregnancies (one abortion), three overdoses, countless drunken antics, pantsings, spilled food, theft, fights, broken limbs, turf wars--every day, a turf war--six months until graduation and no one gets a medal when they get out. But everything you do here counts. High school. \"No, seriously, Jules, just feel around in there and tell me if you have one--\" \"Fuck off, Chris--\" \"And tell me where it is, the exact location.\" \"You\u0027re disgusting!\" \"Hey, Parker!\" He reaches out and grabs me by the shoulder. I shrug, shrug, shrug him off. \"Fuck off, Chris.\" He\u0027s been on about the G-spot for, like, a week. \"Don\u0027t fail me now, Parker. Where is it?\" \"Cosmo, December `94. The Sex Issue. Came with a map and everything.\" \"Hell yes! I knew I could count on you.\" He points at me, grinning, and then the grin falters and he says, \"Wait. You bullshitting me?\" I make him wait for the answer because I\u0027m bullshitting him. \"Chris, I respect you too much to do that.\" \"That\u0027s so sweet. You look good today, Parker.\" \"You bullshitting me?\" \"I respect you too much to do that.\" I look like shit today for a variety of reasons, but let\u0027s start with the muddy running shoes on my feet. Running shoes are expressly forbidden to wear with the school uniform, but damned if I know where my dress shoes disappeared to between now and yesterday. And then there\u0027s my uniform skirt, which has a mustard stain on the front because I can\u0027t do something simple like make a sandwich for lunch without screwing it up. I plucked my rumpled polo shirt from my bedroom floor and I guess I could\u0027ve brushed my hair if I\u0027d wanted to forgo the bus ride and walk all ten miles to school, but supposedly if I miss any more classes I could maybe not graduate, and if I have to spend another year in this concrete block-- \"Shoes, Parker!\" Principal Henley\u0027s got her arms crossed and her eyebrows up. I bring my hands together like I\u0027m appealing to God. I might as well be. \"One day only, Mrs. Henley. See, I got up really late and I couldn\u0027t find my dress shoes and I was so worried about getting here on time--\" \"And the hair--\" \"Can be brushed,\" I say, smoothing my hand over the tangles. \"You\u0027re due at the guidance office in five minutes.\" \"Oh, joy,\" I say. Her eyes flash and I smile. \"No, really.\" Her eyebrows go down. It\u0027s good, but not as good as when I got away with everything. I elbow my way through a mass of people to get to my locker because there\u0027s something immensely satisfying about the toughest part of my arm connecting with the softest part of everyone else. A shapely embodiment of a female Satan appears on the horizon, flipping her long blond hair over her shoulder as she commands the attention of her many underlings. My former underlings. Becky Halprin. \"--I just bluffed my way through it,\" she\u0027s saying as I pass. \"Hey, Parker?\" I half turn. \"What?\" \"Did you get that essay finished for Lerner?\" Shit. \"That was due today?\" Becky stares at me. \"You only had the whole weekend.\" I open my locker. \"Why do you sound surprised?\" \"Bet you fifty bucks you\u0027re fucked.\" \"You\u0027re on,\" I say. \"I can do a lot with fifty bucks.\" She laughs and heads wherever she\u0027s heading. Cheerleading practice, maybe. No. It\u0027s too early, and anyway, I don\u0027t care. Lerner\u0027s essay. I grab my English binder and flip through it until I find the page with FRIDAY and HOMEWORK scrawled messily at the top but nothing underneath. Great. The bell rings. Guidance office. Shit. I grab my brush, slam my locker shut and race against the flow of students heading to their respective homerooms. I reach the office while the bell\u0027s still ringing. I take a minute to catch my breath, stalling, because Ms. Grey would cream herself if she thought I actually made the effort to be on time and I don\u0027t like giving people false hope. I count to ten and run a brush through my hair. One. Two. Three. Ten. Again. A few minutes go by. A few more. When I finally decide to enter the office, I\u0027m still brushing my hair. It\u0027s not meant to be insolent--it\u0027s not insolent--but the thing is, I can\u0027t stop. My hair looks fine, but I just stand there brushing it in front of Grey, who sits at her desk looking all devastated, like I\u0027m mocking her somehow. Sorry, I can\u0027t stop, I want to say, but I don\u0027t. I don\u0027t think I\u0027m really sorry about it, either, but she should know this isn\u0027t some kind of slam at her for making my life a little more inconvenient than it already is. If it was, I\u0027d be a lot more creative about it. I sit down across from her and run the brush through my hair a few more times. \"You\u0027re late,\" she finally manages. My hand relaxes. I lower the brush and rest it in my lap. Grey looks like a bird, a dead-eyed sparrow, and if I had her job, I\u0027d want to kill myself. It\u0027s not like well-adjusted people ever come into the guidance office. You get either the crazy underachievers or the crazy overachievers and both come with their own depressing set of problems. I don\u0027t know. I\u0027d just want to kill myself if I was her, that\u0027s all. \"Yeah,\" I say. \"So we\u0027d better get on with it, huh?\" \"Right.\" She clasps her hands together. \"You already know this, but I think it bears repeating: no cutting, no missed days, no exceptions. You will complete your homework and you will hand it in when it\u0027s due. Off-campus lunch privileges are suspended until you can prove to us that you\u0027re trustworthy again and--\" \"But what if I wake up one morning and I can\u0027t stop vomiting or I\u0027m hemorrhaging or something? Do I still have to go to school?\" She blinks. \"What?\" \"What if I\u0027m really sick? What do I do then?\" \"A parent would have to call in for you. Otherwise you\u0027ll receive a warning--\" \"Right.\" I nod and start chewing my thumbnail. \"Okay.\" She clears her throat. \"On Friday, you\u0027ll meet me here and we\u0027ll talk about any troubles you might have had throughout the week, the progress you\u0027ve made both in and out of school, and--\" \"But what if I miss some assignments, though? I\u0027ve gone so long just not doing them, I think it\u0027s kind of unfair to expect me to get back on the ball right away. You know what I think, Ms. Grey? I think I should get a grace period.\" She leans across the desk, her dead eyes showing a rare sign of life. It freaks me out so much I have to look away. \"This is your grace period, Parker.\" Then I have to run all the way to homeroom. Mr. Bradley makes a point to glare at me when he marks down my attendance because they all must have gotten the Tough Love memo over the weekend. I pause at Chris\u0027s desk and tap my fingers along the wood until he looks up from the math homework he\u0027s scrambling to finish. \"Becky knows where it is.\" He laughs. \"Becky? You\u0027re talking to her now?\" \"Yeah. About G-spots. At length. She\u0027s an expert.\" \"Okay.\" His pale blue eyes twinkle. \"Send her up.\" I wink at him and head to the desk at the back of the room, where Becky\u0027s alternately painting her nails and the cover of her binder with sparkly red polish. A nail here, a red heart there. I slide into the seat next to hers and I don\u0027t waste time. \"Chris wants you.\" Her head whips up. \"Chris wants me?\" \"Yeah. Go see.\" She looks from me to him to me again, to him, to me, and she grins. Chris is popular, cute, all dimples. He wears his uniform shirt a size too small because it makes his muscles look bigger than they actually are and he\u0027s never wanted Becky before. \"Thanks,\" she whispers, standing. She squares her shoulders and walks up the aisle as sexily she can, which is not very sexy at all. As soon as her back is to me, I grab her binder and flip through it, carefully avoiding the drying polish decorating the front. It\u0027s so beautifully organized, I find Lerner\u0027s essay before Becky even gets to Chris. We were supposed to write about patriarchy and Beowulf. I had no idea we even read Beowulf, but I\u0027m resigned to the fact I can\u0027t bullshit my way through this essay as effortlessly as Becky probably has, and since I\u0027m pretty confident she can do it just as effortlessly again, I rip it from her binder. It\u0027s my essay now. \"He\u0027s disgusting,\" Becky says when she comes back. The funny thing is, she won\u0027t even notice the essay\u0027s missing until Lerner\u0027s class and even then she won\u0027t suspect me, because I may have done a lot of stupid things in the last year, but that doesn\u0027t mean I\u0027m an essay thief. People are kind of stupid like that when they think you\u0027re tragic. You get away with a lot even after you\u0027re caught. \"You obviously like disgusting,\" I tell her. She smiles this big blond smile. \"He asked me out, but I wanted to make sure it\u0027s okay with you first.\" Right. \"Screw him, Becky. I don\u0027t care.\" \"Parker--\" \"Becky, really. I don\u0027t want to hear it. You\u0027re dull.\" She rolls her eyes. \"For five seconds you almost seemed human.\" \"Five whole seconds, huh? That\u0027s an improvement. Tell Grey; she\u0027ll love that.\" The bell rings and Becky lunges out of her seat. Chris waits for no one. \"Becky,\" I call after her. She turns. \"I hope you have that fifty on you. I\u0027ll need it for after school.\" I copy her essay during history, unnecessarily exerting myself with a little creative rewriting so it sounds authentically Parker. After history, I run into the new kid. The bell has rung, the halls are filtering out and when I spot him, this new kid, he\u0027s doing that confused stumble around the halls that makes it painfully obvious he has no idea where he is. He\u0027s got brown hair that sort of hangs into his brown eyes and I stare at him when I pass, because new kids generally can\u0027t handle eye contact and I find that amusing. He looks about eighteen and I bet his parents are assholes to do whatever it is they did that he had to transfer in the middle of senior year.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cracked-up-to-be/page-1.html","bookId":1897,"book":{"id":1897,"title":"Cracked Up To Be","description":"Storyline: When \"Perfect\" Parker Fadley starts drinking at school and failing her classes, all of St. Peter\u0027s High goes on alert.
