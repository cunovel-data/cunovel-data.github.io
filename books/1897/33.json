I turn around and open the door, but I can\u0027t go in.\n \"It wouldn\u0027t have made a difference.\"\n The handle slips from my grasp and the door clicks closed.\n \"What?\"\n I face him slowly because I\u0027m afraid of what he said. What I think he said.\n \"I run it through my head every single fucking day, trying to figure it out--and there was a...\" He pauses. \"There was a group of college guys; they crashed it. And Jessie was all over them to get back at me. And I... I was there when Chris carried you out of the woods, after you must\u0027ve... after you saw it happen and you were... you--\"\n He shakes his head and squints up at me.\n \"You couldn\u0027t have changed anything.\"\n \"You don\u0027t know that.\"\n He makes a face like he wants to hit something or scream. And then it disappears and he\u0027s just tired looking, old. But I still don\u0027t believe him.\n \"They\u0027re pretty sure she was dead before the night was out.\" He clenches his hands. \"And I wish it was your fault. If I could make it your fault, I would.\"\n \"It is. If she hadn\u0027t known about you--and I let everyone think she ran away--\" \"You should\u0027ve told,\" he agrees. \"But it wouldn\u0027t have made a difference.\"\n \"Why are you telling me this?\"\n \"Because last night I was thinking about it and I just knew--\" And then he starts crying. God, he\u0027s always crying. \"That she wanted me to.\"\n I bring a shaking hand to my eyes.\n \"You can\u0027t know that,\" I tell him. \"You\u0027re wrong.\"\n This strange and horrible feeling takes up residence in the middle of my chest and spreads through the rest of my body. Something insides me caves and I\u0027m afraid this is going to be the panic attack that kills me.\n The one where my heart beats so fast it disintegrates.\n I pull open the door and stumble into the school and I think he calls me back, Evan, but I don\u0027t care. I walk past the doors to the auditorium; I\u0027m walking blind and everything hurts. I want to cry, it hurts so bad, but I promised myself I wouldn\u0027t cry because I don\u0027t deserve to cry over her. And I want to believe what he\u0027s saying is true, but no one can say it\u0027s true and it doesn\u0027t matter because it doesn\u0027t change anything because she\u0027s dead and she\u0027s never coming back and it\u0027s my fault and I miss her, I miss her so much. I can\u0027t breathe. I can\u0027t. I reach out for the wall and force myself to keep moving because I hear voices coming from the auditorium. It\u0027s over. The service is over.\n So I have to get away.\n Walk, Parker; just keep walking. Just keep--\n \"Parker?\"\n I blink.\n I\u0027m looking into a sparrow\u0027s dead eyes.\n And then I look at my hands. I\u0027m sitting on the floor and there\u0027s a crowd. And then I spot Bailey in the back and he\u0027s staring and he looks sad, but I don\u0027t--\n \"Parker?\" the sparrow says gently. \"Parker, can you hear me?\"\n I don\u0027t want to do this anymore, but I don\u0027t know what else to do.\n I\u0027ve never done it any other way.\n TWENTY-SEVEN\n \"Clearing out, huh?\"\n Chris and Becky walk up to me, holding hands. If the events of the last few weeks have done anything, they\u0027ve made them a stronger couple. So strong, in fact, it doesn\u0027t really matter they have nothing in common because they\u0027re really, really serious about each other now. I wasn\u0027t there when it happened, but I think it means he\u0027s over me.\n I reach into my locker, pull out all of my books and set them on the floor next to the garbage bag beside me. I don\u0027t know how such a small rectangle of space could hold so much crap, but there it is.\n \"Yep,\" I say. Wedged in the very back of the top shelf is a T-shirt I thought I\u0027d lost ages ago. I toss it into the garbage bag.\n \"Will you have to repeat the year?\" Becky asks.\n \"Would that make you happy?\"\n \"I just wondered.\"\n \"Grey and Henley are working something out. I\u0027ll be graduating; I just won\u0027t be...\" I toss a few crumpled pieces of paper into the garbage. \"I just won\u0027t be here.\"\n \"I\u0027ll miss you,\" Chris says.\n My locker is empty. They didn\u0027t want me to come back and empty it, but I insisted. I didn\u0027t want anyone else touching my things. I tie up the garbage bag and brush my hands on my jeans.\n \"It\u0027s not like I won\u0027t still live two streets away,\" I tell him.\n \"Yeah, I know,\" he says. \"I just thought it was worth saying.\"\n So this is it. These things happen fast, I guess. From the moment in the hall to telling Grey the truth to her creaming herself and telling my parents to them crying to the news slowly traveling through the school and not everyone thinks it\u0027s my fault, but no one can say anything for sure. And I\u0027m supposed to know what to do with that. Just like that. The Jessica Wellington murder is all over the local news and sometimes I make myself watch it for hours. They\u0027re calling it a kind of nervous breakdown. I don\u0027t know. I\u0027ve had a couple appointments with that shrink. It was okay.\n \"Big game against St. Anthony\u0027s next weekend,\" Becky says tensely, changing the subject. There\u0027s something validating about the fact she still sees me as a threat, even like this.\n \"Decide on the cheer?\" I ask.\n \"Not yet.\"\n \"Do the `win, lose, it\u0027s all the same\u0027 one.\"\n Her eyes light up. \"You think?\"\n I nod. \"I think.\"\n She studies me. \"You\u0027re not serious.\"\n \"I am,\" I insist. \"I\u0027d even come to the game just to watch everyone laugh at you.\"\n She turns pink.\n \"Maybe you should see if they can\u0027t do something about your personality when they\u0027re fixing your brain,\" she snaps.\n \"Anyway,\" Chris says quickly. He gives me a hug. \"We\u0027ve got to go. We\u0027re meeting Evan for lunch. You need a ride or anything?\"\n \"My mom\u0027s picking me up.\" I give him a small squeeze back. \"But you can do me a favor and toss the garbage in the Dumpster outside.\" \"Sure.\" He hesitates, like he wants to say something else but doesn\u0027t know how to say it. Then he brings his mouth close to my ear and murmurs quietly enough so Becky can\u0027t hear, \"I love you.\"\n But it\u0027s different now.\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" I say.\n \"I know. I knew it before you did.\"\n He leans back and smiles at me while Becky scratches her head, oblivious to the whole exchange. And she\u0027s going to live out the rest of her life like that, but good for her. Chris picks up the garbage bag and swings it over his shoulder.\n \"Jake\u0027s around here somewhere,\" he says.\n \"How about that.\"\n I bend down, gather my books and shove them into my bag.\n \"See you, Parker,\" Becky says.\n \"You can call anytime,\" Chris says over his shoulder. Becky holds out her hand and he takes it. \"If you want.\"\n I wait until they\u0027re gone before I heave my book bag onto my shoulders and straighten up, the bones in my arms and legs crackling in protest. I make the slow trek down the hall. The lunch bell rang twenty minutes ago and it\u0027s mostly quiet but for the distant sounds of talking and laughter coming from the cafeteria.\n I run into Jake outside of art. He\u0027s leaning against the door, his arms crossed.\n \"Hey... hey, you--girl,\" he says.\n It almost makes me smile, but I can\u0027t. \"Hey... hey, you--New Kid.\"\n \"You\u0027re really leaving?\"\n I nod and adjust my book bag.\n \"Yeah. I\u0027m going to get my head screwed on straight and everything. Figure out what\u0027s...\" Even now, I hate saying it. \"What\u0027s been wrong with me.\"\n \"Good,\" he says. \"Is this what you want?\"\n \"I think so.\"\n He lets his arms fall to his sides. \"I\u0027m glad.\"\n \"I hear admitting you have a problem is half the battle.\"\n He stares at me expectantly. I should apologize to him.\n \"Are you going to be around this summer?\" I ask instead.\n \"Nope,\" he says.\n \"Why?\" I hope it wasn\u0027t me. I know it was me. \"I mean, it\u0027s none of my business. But I bet whatever you\u0027re doing can\u0027t be more exciting than the therapy sessions I\u0027ll be stuck in.\"\n \"Probably not,\" Jake agrees. \"I\u0027ll be at my mom\u0027s.\"\n My mouth drops open and he nods.\n \"Yeah, I know.\" He gives me a lopsided grin. \"She doesn\u0027t want me to come, but I\u0027m coming. Dad figures she\u0027ll let me in if I show up on her doorstep and if not, he\u0027ll foot the plane ticket back here. We\u0027ll see what happens.\"\n \"Wow.\"\n \"It was you,\" he says. \"I wouldn\u0027t have done it, but after we...\" It hangs in the air between us. I swallow.\n \"And after summer it\u0027s straight to college, right?\"\n \"Taking the year off, actually,\" Jake says.\n \"Oh,\" I say, surprised. \"And then you\u0027re coming back here?\"\n \"Yep.\"\n \"And I\u0027ll be here.\" As soon as it\u0027s off my lips I\u0027m sorry I\u0027ve said it. I\u0027m just pushing my luck and I don\u0027t even know why. There\u0027s nothing to push. It\u0027s over. I clear my throat. \"Anyway, good luck with your mom.\"\n \"Good luck to you, too,\" he says.\n That\u0027s my cue to go, but my feet are cemented to the floor. He waits for me to move and I can\u0027t because I want everything taken care of before I can start taking care of everything. I know that\u0027s not the way life happens. There are no tidy resolutions. Ask me if I think it was my fault, if I think this heaviness will ever go away.\n \"I\u0027m scared,\" I admit.\n \"That\u0027s because it\u0027s scary,\" he says. \"But it\u0027ll be better this way.\"\n If he says so, it must be true. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cracked-up-to-be/page-33.html","bookId":1897,"book":{"id":1897,"title":"Cracked Up To Be","description":"Storyline: \n When \"Perfect\" Parker Fadley starts drinking at school and failing her classes, all of St. Peter\u0027s High goes on alert.
