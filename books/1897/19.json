So tell me: How `bout them Mets? What do you think?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, they\u0027re just great,\" he mutters. \"So are you depressed--\"\\n\\n I groan. \"Jake.\"\\n\\n \"Okay, okay,\" he says quickly. \"Never mind.\"\\n\\n \"Do you think I\u0027m depressed?\"\\n\\n \"I think it\u0027d explain the bravado.\"\\n\\n \"You think this is bravado?\" I shake my head. \"Actually, you know what? You\u0027re right. I sit at the front.\"\\n\\n I grip the seat ahead of me and stand, but before I can step into the aisle, Jake reaches out and grabs my wrist. I give him a look that says, I don\u0027t have time for this.\\n\\n \"You kissed me,\" he says.\\n\\n \"So?\"\\n\\n \"Would you please sit down? I want to talk to you.\"\\n\\n I do it.\\n\\n \"Look, I\u0027m sorry that you--\" He doesn\u0027t finish and I\u0027m glad because he\u0027d only embarrass us both if he started apologizing for something he knows nothing about. \"Why did you kiss me if you were just going to shut me out after?\"\\n\\n I shrug. \"Had to fill the moment at the coffeeshop somehow.\"\\n\\n \"Ouch.\"\\n\\n \"You were expecting something more?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, I guess I was.\"\\n\\n \"Why would you do a stupid thing like that?\" I chew my lip. \"The way you feel about me freaks me out. I\u0027ve told you that.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe the way you feel about me freaks you out.\"\\n\\n \"But I don\u0027t know how I feel about you. I try not to think about it. And I\u0027ve told you that.\"\\n\\n I guess he knows I could run us in circles forever, so he leans in and gives me a kiss, all soft and hesitant, and I think it\u0027s supposed to make my heart beat faster and my head feel lighter, but it doesn\u0027t. It steals my breath and makes the tips of my fingers tingle and I start thinking I\u0027ll have an anxiety thing again, here on the bus while his mouth is against mine, and how awful that would be. A funny thought occurs to me at the same time Jake brings his hand to my face: I couldn\u0027t do this even if I wanted to do this.\\n\\n \"Stop telling Jake things about me.\"\\n\\n Chris slams his locker door shut. \"You\u0027re talking to me now?\"\\n\\n \"Why did you tell Jake I tried to kill myself?\"\\n\\n He pretends to think about it. \"Because you did?\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t.\" I rest against his locker. \"That\u0027s what you think I did.\"\\n\\n He does that lean guys do with their girls. I\u0027m against his locker and he rests his hand just above my head and tilts forward so we\u0027re close. He doesn\u0027t even think before he does it; it\u0027s second nature. We used to stand like this every day between classes and he\u0027d give me a kiss when the bell went. Sex is one thing, but I always thought that stupid lean meant intimacy. Because I was dumb.\\n\\n \"You drank a bottle of Jack Daniel\u0027s and downed a bottle of sleeping pills. I don\u0027t think you tried to kill yourself, Parker; I know it.\"\\n\\n \"You obviously know nothing and now Jake\u0027s getting the wrong idea about me.\"\\n\\n \"What do you care what Jake thinks about you?\" He rolls his eyes. \"Okay, you tell me what you think happened and if I think it has merit, I\u0027ll find him and clear things up. Sound fair?\"\\n\\n \"I got drunk first,\" I explain. \"And then I miscounted how many sleeping pills I needed to get through the night. It\u0027s hard to count when you\u0027re all fucked up.\"\\n\\n \"Well of course!\" He slaps his forehead in disbelief. \"That explains everything. How could I have been so stupid?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m serious. Stop telling Jake things.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t tell him anything everyone doesn\u0027t already know. That\u0027s fair game.\" Chris finally becomes aware of the way he\u0027s standing and how close we actually are. He straightens and rubs his hands on his shirt. \"He really likes you, huh?\"\\n\\n \"I guess. Why do you think that is?\"\\n\\n \"Damned if I know. That\u0027s not exactly the type of conversation you want to have with the ex. But I picked up on it, took pity on the guy and told him about that one time you tried to kill yourself.\"\\n\\n It starts making sense. \"You wanted to scare him away.\"\\n\\n \"No, I thought I\u0027d let him take comfort in the fact that when you\u0027re fucking with other people, you\u0027re really just fucking with yourself. Becky and I had a talk about it and she threw that theory out there, and I gotta say it makes so much sense.\"\\n\\n \"Becky is becoming a real pain in my ass.\"\\n\\n \"Becoming?\" Chris studies me. \"You like him, don\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"Would that bother you?\"\\n\\n \"Even if it did, I\u0027ve resolved not to let it ruin a good time with Becks.\"\\n\\n \"Becks?\" I shake my head, disgusted. \"But you don\u0027t love her.\"\\n\\n He shrugs.\\n\\n \"You love me,\" I say.\\n\\n He shrugs again.\\n\\n \"Oh, come on--this from the same guy who blackmailed me into kissing him in the change room because he missed me so bad? You\u0027ve never liked Becky--\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t really know her before. And believe it or not, Parker, things happen around you that have nothing to do with you even if they start out that way. She\u0027s not that bad. By the way, Evan\u0027s back in two weeks. He has to get all his shit from his aunt\u0027s and cut his hair, but you should prepare yourself.\"\\n\\n It throws me. I need a second.\\n\\n \"So he just cuts his hair and he\u0027s back?\" I ask. \"Everything\u0027s like it was?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, hopefully. Are you going to be okay? I worry--\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t.\"\\n\\n I head in the opposite direction, to my locker, open it and grab my English books. The bottle Becky gave me is sitting on the top shelf, face out, so everyone will see it, but no one sees it. I\u0027d like Chris to see it. And I\u0027d like him to ask me where I got it.\\n\\n \"Hey, Jake! Stop!\" I manage to catch him between third and fourth period heading to whatever class it is he heads to. He waits for me to jog over.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s wrong?\" he asks when I reach him.\\n\\n I untie my ponytail and retie it. I\u0027m not sure how to do this.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" I finally say.\\n\\n He raises an eyebrow. \"You\u0027re sorry?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah.\" I untie my ponytail again. \"I don\u0027t know.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t... know?\"\\n\\n \"And even if I did, I wouldn\u0027t know how to say it.\"\\n\\n \"Parker, what are you talking about?\"\\n\\n My stomach twists. \"I think you\u0027re okay, but I know you deserve better.\"\\n\\n He looks totally confused now.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re making my brain hurt--\"\\n\\n \"So now you can\u0027t say I didn\u0027t warn you.\"\\n\\n He stares at me a long time. And then I see a light go on. Vaguely.\\n\\n \"Does that mean you--\"\\n\\n My stomach twists again. \"Don\u0027t call it anything yet,\" I say.\\n\\n He nods slowly.\\n\\n \"I have to go.\"\\n\\n I leave him in the hall and run to the girls\u0027 washroom, where I push through the closest stall door and throw up.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re like Jake in dog form,\" I tell Bailey after I mark the day Evan is coming back on the calendar above my bed. I sit down beside him and pet him. \"I wish we hadn\u0027t gotten you.\"\\n\\n Bailey gives me this uncomprehending, painfully loyal look.\\n\\n \"You make me feel bad,\" I clarify.\\n\\n I reach for my math book, open it to the unit I never did and start reviewing. I have that test tomorrow and I need to pass it because I want to graduate, I guess.\\n\\n I guess.\\n\\n So I can get out. They can all leave me alone forever. Right. I stare at my calendar. At that big red X.\\n\\n \"Wow.\"\\n\\n Mrs. Jones looks up from my test, all startled. I insisted she mark it as soon as I scribbled down the answer to the last question and watched her eyes grow wider with every red checkmark. I\u0027m not nearly so surprised; I stayed up all night studying like I used to. Sometime after midnight it became imperative to me that I show everyone I still possess those wonderful qualities that helped separate me from everyone else.\\n\\n Because it makes the way I am now that much more frustrating for them.\\n\\n Jones shakes her head in total disbelief as she scribbles a bright red 100% in the upper right-hand corner of the paper.\\n\\n \"Congratulations, Parker.\"\\n\\n \"This demands celebration,\" Chris says, holding up the test and waving it around. Jake laughs and Becky gives a tight-lipped smile.\\n\\n I rip it from Chris\u0027s hand. \"It does not demand a celebration.\"\\n\\n Suddenly, we\u0027re a group. Jake caught me outside of math, saw the test score and told Chris, who was with Becky, as we passed them in the hall. And here we are.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re right,\" Chris agrees. \"I\u0027m just looking for an excuse to party.\"\\n\\n \"Party?\"\\n\\n \"Hang out.\" He chews his lower lip. It\u0027s what he does when he\u0027s thinking. He doesn\u0027t do it very often. \"Why don\u0027t we all go to my house after school and rent a movie or whatever? My parents won\u0027t be home.\"\\n\\n \"Sounds good,\" Jake says.\\n\\n \"Because I got a perfect score on my math test?\"\\n\\n \"If there\u0027s got to be a reason, that can be it,\" Chris says.\\n\\n \"Can\u0027t. My parents wouldn\u0027t like that.\" And for the first time in my life I\u0027m happy to say this: \"You know, because of my curfew and all. And it\u0027s a school night.\" \"Well, let\u0027s try them,\" Chris says. He wanders over to the pay phone, sticks a quarter in, dials my house and hands me the phone.\\n\\n \"Oh, fuck you,\" I say, pushing it away.\\n\\n He brings it up to his ear.\\n\\n \"Hi, Mrs. Fadley? This is Chris...\" He pauses and winks at me. \"I know, it\u0027s been way too long... Yeah! I\u0027m great. Yourself?... That\u0027s great... Uh-huh--oh no, it\u0027s nothing like that. Parker\u0027s fine.\"\\n\\n Becky and Jake stare at me. I pinch the bridge of my nose.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m calling because a few of us are getting together at my house after school. We\u0027re going to rent a movie, that sort of thing... Yeah. I was wondering if Parker could join us. She mentioned a curfew and it might be a little late by the time we\u0027re done, but I\u0027d drive her home and--yeah, my parents will be home... Uh-huh, yeah. Just a sec...\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cracked-up-to-be/page-19.html","bookId":1897,"book":{"id":1897,"title":"Cracked Up To Be","description":"Storyline: When \"Perfect\" Parker Fadley starts drinking at school and failing her classes, all of St. Peter\u0027s High goes on alert.
