Because that\u0027s what my psychiatrist told me to do. So I almost hold out my hand to shake his, a symbol of acceptance and moving on, but even I\u0027m smart enough to know how stupid that would be. So I force a smile at him and continue my way down the hall. \"Hey, Parker?\" I pause. \"I\u0027ll see you in the fall,\" he says. \"I mean, you never know, right? Maybe we\u0027ll actually get somewhere this time.\" I turn around and he\u0027s standing in the middle of the hall, smiling at me, but I can\u0027t think of anything to say. We stay like that for a minute until he inclines his head and goes where he\u0027s going and I\u0027m alone, like I\u0027ve wanted forever, except that\u0027s not really true because Mom\u0027s waiting for me outside and there\u0027s a shrink waiting for me in the city and there\u0027s nothing I can do about the past. \"Recovery\" is going to be boring and painful and painfully boring, I can already tell. Which is good, I guess. I hope it works.
