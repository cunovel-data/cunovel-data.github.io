Lerner had a headache so he told us to read `The Yellow Wallpaper\u0027 again--\"\n \"We read it before?\"\n \"Yeah, in ninth grade. Anyway, he wants us to write a thousand words on how we relate to the story now, as seniors, compared to how we related to it as freshmen. It\u0027s pretty half-assed, but like I said, he had a headache.\"\n \"`The Yellow Wallpaper\u0027 is the one where the chick goes insane and starts humping the wall at the end, right?\"\n She stares. \"You might wanna reread it again to be safe.\"\n Pfft. \"We\u0027ll see. Ready for your date tonight?\"\n \"Yeah, got my pink sweater dry-cleaned and everything,\" she says, and then she puts on her fake- interested face. \"How\u0027d your meeting with Grey go?\"\n \"It\u0027s six o\u0027clock, right? The date?\" I ask. She nods. \"Look, I\u0027ve got to go. I don\u0027t want to miss the bus.\"\n On the ride home, I pass the time imagining their date. Chris will take Becky somewhere predictable and nice, even though he could take her Dumpster diving and she\u0027d be happy because she\u0027s wanted him so long, and he\u0027ll spend the whole time trying desperately hard not to stare at her breasts, because that G-spot stuff is all bravado, but by the end of the night he\u0027ll be feeling her up, telling her she\u0027s pretty, the prettiest, and she\u0027ll blush and say, Oh, Chris, and they\u0027ll make another date and they\u0027ll fall in love and she\u0027ll be a cheerleading coach and he\u0027ll be an heir and they\u0027ll have two-point-five kids and, and, and...\n \"I think we should get a dog.\"\n It\u0027s one of my better entrances. Dad lowers the paper and Mom drops the potato she\u0027s peeling over the sink and they look at me like I\u0027m certifiable, but I\u0027d rather be certifiable than perpetually boring, which is my parents in a nutshell. If I had to own up to resembling either one of them, it\u0027d be my dad. We both have brown hair and sharp features. Mom\u0027s less sharp, more Pillsbury.\n \"A dog?\" Mom says, retrieving the potato. \"You think we should get a dog?\"\n \"That\u0027s what I said.\"\n Dad returns to the paper. \"I\u0027ve always wanted a dog.\"\n \"Well, a puppy actually,\" I say.\n \"I\u0027ve always wanted a puppy,\" he amends. \"They turn into dogs.\"\n \"What?\" Mom demands, turning to him. \"What\u0027s that supposed to mean? We\u0027re getting a puppy, just like that?\"\n \"No, not just like that. We\u0027d have to talk about it more. Figure out the logistics.\" He glances at Mom. \"It wouldn\u0027t be so terrible, would it? Having a dog?\"\n She turns to me.\n \"Where did this come from, Parker? You don\u0027t want a dog.\" \"Yes, I do! Ms. Grey said it would be good for me to--to...\" I chew my lip and start making faces that obviously indicate I\u0027m in the process of lying, but my parents hate believing I do that. Lie. \"She said it would be a good learning experience for me. By learning to nurture a puppy into a healthy dog I could... in turn... learn to nurture myself again! And I did all my homework this week, so I\u0027d say I\u0027ve earned it.\"\n \"You couldn\u0027t start out with a goldfish?\"\n \"Goldfish die at the drop of a hat, Mom. It could die of completely natural causes after two weeks and I might think it was something I did and I wouldn\u0027t be able to live with myself. Puppies are harder to kill and more challenging to take care of and I\u0027m pretty sure that\u0027s the point.\"\n Mom and Dad exchange a long look.\n \"We\u0027ll have to talk about it,\" Dad says, which means we\u0027re getting a dog.\n \"Great. You two do that and call me when dinner\u0027s ready. I\u0027ll be in my room.\"\n \"But don\u0027t you want to tell us about the rest of your--\"\n I\u0027m a bad daughter. I don\u0027t go to my room at first; I hang back in the hall and listen. Mom and Dad are quiet for a little bit and then Mom goes, \"Did you find that as oddly encouraging as I did?\"\n And Dad goes, \"Yeah. She hasn\u0027t really talked to us in a long time.\"\n \"You think her guidance counselor really thinks she should get a dog?\"\n \"It could be a lie.\"\n \"And if it is?\"\n \"We can check. But look, if she is lying it\u0027s because she wants a dog. It\u0027s not like she\u0027s lying about where she\u0027s been and who she\u0027s been with...\"\n My dad, the softie.\n \"And that makes it okay?\"\n \"No, but maybe a dog could foster some kind of... sense of responsibility and... discourage her recklessness...\"\n \"So we should get a dog? That\u0027s what you\u0027re saying?\"\n \"Who knows? But she talked to us, Lara. She asked us for something we can give her.\"\n \"It would be nice to feel like we were doing something.\" Quiet. Mom clears her throat. \"Now come over here and taste this and tell me if it\u0027s awful...\"\n I check out at dinnertime. I mean, I\u0027m there and I\u0027m eating, but I spend the meal staring into space, nodding my head every time it\u0027s clear my parents are talking to me and sometimes when it isn\u0027t. When our plates are empty and we fall into that awkward silence that happens between digesting and clearing the table, I come back to myself.\n \"May I please go for a walk?\"\n It\u0027s a big question because I have a curfew now, but my parents\u0027 spines are so pliable I don\u0027t think it\u0027ll be a problem. Mom and Dad exchange a nervous glance and have a telepathic conversation about it. I hear every word.\n Do we let her out? It\u0027s past curfew.\n True, but look at that--at least she asked!\n I know! I can hardly believe it!\n She could have just sneaked out, but she asked!\n I know! We\u0027re good parents!\n \"What time will you be back?\" Dad asks. \"What time is it now?\"\n \"It\u0027s seven.\"\n \"Within the hour, I guess.\"\n \"Where are you going?\"\n \"It\u0027s just a walk.\" I make sure to look them both in the eyes. \"That\u0027s it.\"\n \"Sure...,\" Mom says slowly, staring at Dad, who nods slightly. \"That would be fine. Thank you for asking, Parker.\"\n I\u0027m out of the house quick in case they change their minds. It\u0027s dark out, but I have a Mini Maglite attached to my key ring, so I\u0027m not worried. It feels nice having the streets to myself. Every so often I hear the sound of cars in the distance navigating some faraway road.\n Chris lives two blocks from me, in the nicest house on the nicest piece of property in all of Corby, Connecticut, and I\u0027m sure he\u0027s still out with Becky and no doubt his parents are at the country club. When his house comes into view, I walk up the gravel driveway casually, so if any of the neighbors happen to look out their windows I\u0027m only here for a visit. Nothing unusual.\n I bypass the front door and edge my way around the house, maneuvering past shriveled flower beds and tacky lawn ornaments until I find myself in the backyard, facing the woods behind the house. These woods never change. The pine trees stand tall and separate, illuminated by the light of some far-off source. When I come here, it always takes me a while to get my bearings, but I can\u0027t afford to do that tonight because I promised my parents I\u0027d be home within the hour and I\u0027m not wearing a watch.\n I trudge into the trees and pull out my Mini Maglite. One step, two steps, ten steps, twenty, twenty- five steps. I turn the flashlight on. A feeble, yellow light reveals a small strip of ground laden with pine needles.\n It was around here...\n And then, without fail, I hear the music from that night, like I always do when I come out here. A heavy bass line and an earsplitting drumbeat winds its way into the woods from Chris\u0027s open bedroom window, where he likes to mount the speakers of his sound system for optimal noise blaring into the neighborhood. And then there\u0027s splashing sounds coming from the pool and everyone\u0027s laughing and talking and shrieking and having a good time.\n His parties are the best.\n I stick the flashlight in my mouth, get down on my hands and knees and start pushing aside pine needles. Five minutes later, my throat hitches. I rip the flashlight from my mouth, scramble backward and throw up.\n Fuck.\n I wipe my mouth, force myself to my feet, move past the puddle of vomit and get back to work. I don\u0027t know what I think I\u0027ll find out here, but I stay on the ground for a while anyway, searching, until I know the hour\u0027s gone and I\u0027m late and I\u0027d better go. I don\u0027t want Chris to come back and see me here and ask me what I\u0027m doing.\n Finding the bracelet that time was just a fluke, Parker, you idiot.\n THREE\n Jake\u0027s a rather tenacious young man. Monday starts with him waiting for me by my locker, and I\u0027m really not in the mood for it because I might have a hangover.\n Okay, that\u0027s not true. I\u0027m kind of in the mood for it because it is vaguely intriguing. I have clearly charmed the guy out of his mind.\n \"You\u0027re in my way.\" I nudge him aside. I think Grey knows I\u0027m hungover. She gave me this extralong look when we passed in the hall earlier, and that\u0027s never good. I grab my history books and slam my locker shut, which makes the bad headache I\u0027m nursing worse. Like that, my vague state of intrigue fades. \"What do you want, Jake?\"\n \"In your pants.\" He turns red and cringes. \"I mean, I don\u0027t want into your pants. And I didn\u0027t. I\u0027m not interested in you.\"\n \"Okay.\" I bite the inside of my cheek to keep from laughing. \"Thanks for that.\"\n I head for homeroom, but Jake expects more apparently, because he follows after me.\n \"That\u0027s it? That\u0027s all you\u0027re going to say?\"\n \"You don\u0027t want in my pants. Duly noted.\"\n A couple passing freshmen give us startled looks.\n \"Look, I was just trying to be nice to you and--\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cracked-up-to-be/page-4.html","bookId":1897,"book":{"id":1897,"title":"Cracked Up To Be","description":"Storyline: \n When \"Perfect\" Parker Fadley starts drinking at school and failing her classes, all of St. Peter\u0027s High goes on alert.
