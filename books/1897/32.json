{"id":85992,"no":32,"title":"Page 32","content":"Until something you can\u0027t ignore happens and you see it all over yourself. And there\u0027s only one thing left to do. I throw myself at Chris, wrap my arms around him and press my lips against his, something I haven\u0027t done in a long time. He holds on to me, surprised, and I reach into his pocket and grab his wallet. It snags on his jeans and I give it a little tug. Maybe he feels it and pretends he doesn\u0027t. Two hundred miles later, he\u0027s three hundred dollars poorer and I\u0027m at the Morton Motel getting ready to die. I debate leaving a note, but it comes out like a legal waiver. I unscrew the bottle of pills and the booze, and with every bitter swallow I\u0027m less afraid of myself. I\u0027m finally doing the right thing. Except I fuck it up and I end up in the hospital where I get my stomach pumped and I live. The first time I wake up, I think I\u0027ve died and I think it\u0027s heaven. The second time I wake up, I know I\u0027m in hell and Chris is crying over me. \"I can\u0027t pay you back,\" I murmur thickly. \"Are you awake?\" I take a deep breath in. The air is sweet, dead-flower sweet. My stomach turns and I think I\u0027m going to throw up, but I don\u0027t. A minute later, I open my eyes. I\u0027m in Chris\u0027s guest room and he\u0027s sitting on the bed, peering at me. The lamp on the nightstand is on, casting a weak yellow wash over both of us, and the window reveals a black night sky outside. My head aches. \"I know that face,\" Chris says quietly. And then he starts explaining, like I asked, like I even care. \"Becky found you, and Jake and I got you out of school by--by the grace of God, I think.\" My mouth tastes vomit sour. \"Because we were looking all over for you after Evan...\" He edges up the bed until he\u0027s close enough to hold my hand and then he does it and I wish he wouldn\u0027t. And I wish he\u0027d shut up. \"She\u0027s been dead awhile. Jessie.\" He says it like he can\u0027t believe it. His voice breaks. \"I mean, a long time ago. I heard it on the news this morning, before I came to school. I guess they found her over the weekend. That was on the news, too. But they didn\u0027t say who it was because they had to... they had-- it\u0027s crazy, isn\u0027t it? I mean, when you think about it. It doesn\u0027t feel real.\" \"Chris.\" My voice comes out splintered, gravel. \"Stop talking.\" \"But no one thought she was alive anyway, did they.\" He stares at the wall, his eyes bright. He swallows once, twice, three times, his Adam\u0027s apple going up and down. A couple tears slide down his cheek and he brushes them away. \"Jake said you told him you wanted to die.\" He turns to me and the look in his eyes reminds me of Bailey on the side of the road. \"I went downstairs to get water and you told him you wanted to die.\" \"Anyone would say that after a bottle of Jack Daniel\u0027s,\" I say. \"That\u0027s not how you meant it and you know it.\" He keeps looking at me until I\u0027m the one who has to look away. \"Why?\" I want to sit up, but I can\u0027t guarantee my stomach won\u0027t revolt and it\u0027s a miracle I haven\u0027t already puked on the white duvet. \"I want to die, I guess.\" It gets so quiet. \"Why?\" But I\u0027ve had enough. He wasn\u0027t even supposed to find me. Henley, Grey--they were supposed to find me and kick me out of school so my parents would give up on me and then everyone would give up on me and I wouldn\u0027t have to worry anymore. I push the duvet off, swing my legs over the bed and stand. \"I\u0027m going,\" I tell him. \"Parker--\" My legs are shaky, but I make it across the room and then I get to the door and I puke. I mean, I feel it coming up, clamp my hand over my mouth and reach the bathroom just in time. My stomach muscles scream. A few dry heaves later, I\u0027m propped up against the wall, panting. I rest my head against my knees while Chris stands in the doorway, watching. A bead of sweat trickles down the back of my neck and under my shirt collar. I gulp air like it\u0027s going out of style. \"You think I ever stopped wanting to die after the motel?\" I ask. \"You think a feeling like that just goes away?\" He steps forward and steels himself like he\u0027s about to give a speech to a room full of people. He probably thought one up the whole time I was out, just waiting for me to wake up so he could say it and we could have A Moment That Would Turn It All Around. But if you learn anything by the time you\u0027re eighteen, it\u0027s that those moments don\u0027t happen in real life. Ever. \"I don\u0027t want you to die,\" he says woodenly, but the funny thing is, he really means it. \"I don\u0027t want to go to your memorial service.\" \"Memorial service,\" I repeat. \"When\u0027s Jessie\u0027s memorial service going to be?\" \"Are you even listening to me?\" I groan, rest my head against the wall and close my eyes. \"I\u0027m just tired, Chris. And my stomach hurts and I have a headache and--\" My voice breaks. She\u0027s dead and I am not going to cry. \"I\u0027m tired.\" \"Then you should sleep,\" he says. I find my way to my feet and head back to the bedroom. Chris follows close behind. I crawl under the covers and he pulls the duvet up around me. \"It shouldn\u0027t be like this for you,\" he says. \"You need help.\" \"What I need is for everyone to leave me alone. That\u0027s what I want.\" \"Parker, you don\u0027t want that. Everyone\u0027s on to you and you don\u0027t even know it. You have to stop this; you have to--\" I think he\u0027s crying. \"I don\u0027t want you to die.\" I roll over so my back is to him. \"It\u0027s just Jessie,\" I say into the pillow. \"I\u0027m just shocked about it. That\u0027s all.\" But the truth is, I haven\u0027t felt a thing since Evan. \"Yeah, but you\u0027ve always needed help,\" Chris points out. \"Even she knew it. I think she\u0027d want that for you.\" \"And I don\u0027t think we should be talking about me.\" I close my eyes. TWENTY-SIX \"How are you doing?\" It\u0027s not like when someone who\u0027s there one minute is gone the next. It\u0027s worse. \"I\u0027m great.\" \"So,\" Jake says, staring at me expectantly. \"Are we going to stand in front of the school all day or are we going in?\" I stare up at the concrete building. The memorial service is today. \"You could always go in without me,\" I tell him. Before he can say anything, I ask, \"Do you think if I\u0027d told you it would\u0027ve made a difference? About how I knew Jessie?\" \"Between us?\" he asks. I nod. \"Probably not, unless you had a completely different personality or something. But then I doubt I\u0027d have found you as interesting.\" \"Sounds like I was destined to screw you over, then.\" \"Doesn\u0027t it.\" At least I didn\u0027t have to stress over what I was going to wear to the service. Thank God for school uniforms, just this once. But I couldn\u0027t find my dress shoes, so I\u0027m wearing muddy running shoes. And I forgot to brush my hair. \"Too bad it couldn\u0027t have been different.\" He shrugs. \"It can always be different.\" It\u0027s weird the way all of this has dulled the fact we had sex and I ran. My parents have forgotten about Bailey. Henley and Grey don\u0027t care about me skipping afternoon classes. It\u0027s okay I spent the night at Chris\u0027s. It\u0027s okay because Jessie\u0027s dead. Because they don\u0027t know what I did. Didn\u0027t do. \"Are you ready to go in?\" Jake asks. \"I can\u0027t go in.\" \"Chris will be there and I\u0027ll be there.\" He clears his throat. \"Uh... and Becky will be there, too.\" \"Well, if Becky\u0027s going to be there...\" A few cars pull into the parking lot. I recognize Mr. and Mrs. Wellington\u0027s Saab right away. My chest tightens. \"I can\u0027t go in,\" I repeat. I snap my fingers. \"Make an excuse for me. Please.\" \"I can do that for you,\" he says. I must sound desperate enough. He pauses. \"What was she like?\" My stomach ties itself into little knots and I keep snapping my fingers. \"You have this knack for asking questions I don\u0027t want to answer.\" \"You don\u0027t have to answer it.\" \"She was like...\" I raise my head and look to the sky and try to think of a way to put it. \"She was like a buffer between me and the rest of the world. Nice. Good.\" He reaches out and gives my shoulder a squeeze before heading into the school without me. After a while, Evan shows up. Or maybe he\u0027s always been there, watching from his car in the parking lot or behind the sole maple tree they planted in front of the school to make it look less like a concrete penitentiary; I don\u0027t know. He\u0027s just here, which means I have to leave. I hurry up the steps, wrench the front door open and-- Except I can\u0027t go inside. \"I just want to talk,\" he says. \"Is that all? Sure you don\u0027t want to attack me again, too?\" He sighs. \"I shouldn\u0027t have done that. I--\" \"Evan, I don\u0027t care.\" \"Oh, right, I get it,\" he says. \"You\u0027re right back into it, aren\u0027t you?\" \"Back into what?\" The wind picks up, pushing my hair in my face. I shiver, brush it away and face him. I try to read what\u0027s in his eyes, but there\u0027s nothing there. I remember when I caught him with Jenny. How scared he was. And I was happy because I wanted to hurt Jessie for caring that I spent junior year hiding out in the girls\u0027 room between periods, hyperventilating. She wanted to help me and I wanted to hurt her for it because I didn\u0027t want anyone to know because it was important because... Perfect people don\u0027t break. I can\u0027t remember what was running through me when I saw her face pressed into the ground with that guy on top of her, I was so out of it, but I can\u0027t convince myself it wasn\u0027t bad. All I know is I went to a party and I was the catalyst for every horrible thing that happened there and after and I don\u0027t know why I didn\u0027t say anything when I saw her and I don\u0027t know why I didn\u0027t say anything later and I don\u0027t know how to fix it and I\u0027m afraid of what happens next, so I have to keep doing it this way until it\u0027s right again, but I don\u0027t know how to make it right again because I\u0027m always wrong.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cracked-up-to-be/page-32.html","bookId":1897,"book":{"id":1897,"title":"Cracked Up To Be","description":"Storyline: When \"Perfect\" Parker Fadley starts drinking at school and failing her classes, all of St. Peter\u0027s High goes on alert.
