{"id":85968,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"\"You\u0027re good at that,\" Jake says, as I settle on my new branch. \"I\u0027ve lived in trees my whole life.\" \"Do you have some kind of retort for everything?\" \"I\u0027m the straightest talker you\u0027ve ever met.\" \"Oh, really? I think most of what comes out of your mouth is--\" And that\u0027s when the goddamn branch gives out. FIVE The fall takes no time and forever. I land on my feet for a split second and then my legs crumple and I\u0027m flat on my back and I don\u0027t know whether to laugh or cry or swear because I can\u0027t believe the other branch broke, so I just lay there not moving instead. \"Jesus--Parker?\" Dead leaves crunch under Jake\u0027s feet as he hurries over. I should say something. He kneels down. \"Parker? Are you okay?\" \"I can\u0027t feel my legs.\" He turns white. \"Are you serious?\" \"No.\" \"Not funny,\" he snaps. \"You\u0027re okay?\" \"I\u0027m fine.\" I prop myself up on my elbow and ignore the insistent, toothachelike pain going on in my right ankle. Jake doesn\u0027t need to know about that. \"Nice catch,\" I say. He laughs and stands, brushing the dirt from his knees. \"Like I was gonna catch you. Come on, let\u0027s get out of here; it\u0027s getting dark.\" I extend my hands. Jake looks surprised, but he grabs me by the wrists and hoists me up. I stumble into him. Busted. He gives me a look. \"You hurt yourself, didn\u0027t you?\" \"Nothing\u0027s broken.\" \"But you hurt yourself, didn\u0027t you?\" \"I\u0027ve had worse injuries on the cheerleading squad.\" \"Parker,\" Jake says impatiently. \"What hurts?\" \"Ankle.\" \"There, that wasn\u0027t so hard, was it?\" He pauses and looks awkward. \"Uh... do you need to lean on me or--\" \"No,\" I say emphatically. \"I\u0027m good for limping, thanks.\" \"I have this crazy feeling you\u0027d say that even if you weren\u0027t.\" We make our way back through the woods. I take a sharp breath in for every step forward, but I don\u0027t think it\u0027s anything serious. I\u0027ll get the compress out when I get home and I\u0027ll be good for Monday or I could run up and down the stairs until it\u0027s so inflamed I couldn\u0027t possibly make it to school. But I\u0027ll give Jake credit. He slows his pace to accommodate my stupid injury and he doesn\u0027t go tearing off into the woods like I might\u0027ve done to him. I kind of wish he would, though, as he feels the need to pass the time by talking. \"So what\u0027d you do that you have to see Ms. Grey once a week?\" \"Run-of-the-mill-delinquent stuff,\" I say. \"It\u0027s none of your business.\" \"Okay.\" Limp, limp, limp. \"I got drunk at school. A lot. Earlier this year.\" I only admit it because it\u0027s something he probably already knows. People talk. I can\u0027t be the first person he\u0027s asked about me. He shoves his hands in his pockets. \"Do you have, like... a problem?\" \"Yeah, and that was my solution.\" He looks all uncomfortable and I laugh. \"Lighten up. If I say I don\u0027t, you wouldn\u0027t believe that, right? Anyone who says they don\u0027t have a drinking problem usually does.\" \"Do they?\" he asks. I take a hard step on my ankle and gasp. He pauses, but I wave him off before he can ask if I\u0027m okay. We keep moving and he starts talking again. God, I wish he\u0027d shut up. \"So why did you drink?\" \"I--\" Limp, limp, limp. \"What does Chris tell you about me?\" \"He said the pressures of being popular made your brain snap.\" \"Seriously?\" \"Yeah.\" I\u0027m so touched; he lied for me. Might as well go along with it. \"It was something like that, yeah.\" \"I\u0027m sorry it was so hard for you,\" Jake says. He means it. And then he gets quiet, but now I want to talk. \"Do you feel you know me a little better now?\" I ask. He gives me an appraising look. \"You\u0027re not that bad.\" \"It\u0027s the sprained ankle. It ups my likability because I can\u0027t kick your ass with a broken foot. You probably have a thing for girls when they\u0027re vulnerable because they make you feel like that much more of a man--\" \"I take it back; you are that bad. You\u0027re--\" He shakes his head. \"Never mind; just shut up.\" \"You totally softened after I fell out of the tree. I\u0027m just saying.\" \"Yeah, well, I think any decent human being would.\" He picks up the pace. My ankle gives me no choice but to fall behind. \"I wouldn\u0027t,\" I say to his back. We split up at the corner to my house after I give him directions to Chris\u0027s and it\u0027s tense and awkward and unhappy, but that\u0027s the way I like it. Jake should know--well, everyone should know-- there\u0027s no such thing as a decent human being. It\u0027s just an illusion. And when it\u0027s gone, it\u0027s really gone. SIX \"WIN OR LOSE! \"IT\u0027S ALL THE SAME! \"WE DO OUR BEST! \"WE\u0027VE GOT GAME!...\" \"Stop!\" I shout. I don\u0027t even want to hear the rest of it. The girls stare at me, frozen in a ludicrous pose, arms up and out. They remind me of Barbie dolls wearing orange and yellow. This is a new cheer. Becky tabled it. I didn\u0027t want to do it, but she begged for months. \"You have to let us try it, Parker! The girls will be great!\" But they\u0027re not great. They suck and the cheer sucks. \"No,\" I tell them. \"Absolutely not. It\u0027s a cheer about being okay with losing--how can you think that\u0027s appropriate on any level, Becky? Do you want us to look like fools when we play against St. Mary\u0027s?\" \"It\u0027s not about being okay with losing,\" Becky snorts. \"It\u0027s about good sportsmanship!\" I ignore her. \"Line up! We\u0027ll do the Victory chant for now and I\u0027ll figure out something else later, but forget this `do our best\u0027 piece of shit. We\u0027re not doing it. And you were all terrible.\" Becky\u0027s mouth drops open. \"I\u0027m sure she doesn\u0027t totally mean it like that, guys,\" Jessie says, staring at me. Mom bursts into my room and opens the blinds. I pull the blankets over my head and groan. There\u0027s something about the early morning rays of sunshine beating down on my face that makes me want to puke. \"Today\u0027s a big day!\" she announces. \"How does your foot feel?\" \"I don\u0027t know; I haven\u0027t stepped on it yet. Oh my God, Mom, would you close the blinds--\" \"You should be excited! Today\u0027s the day we\u0027re bringing Bailey home!\" Bailey. The dog. We passed the interview process, filled out the adoption forms, and I chose the dog next in line to be put down, even though he\u0027s not a puppy, because I\u0027m thoughtful like that. Bailey\u0027s a ten-year-old harrier with a happy disposition and I think he\u0027ll make a great daughter, for a dog. Mom leaves. I swing my legs over the bed, touch my foot to the floor and stand. It feels better, but I doubt I\u0027ll be walking Bailey this week. Falling out of a tree was good for something; Mom or Dad can bond with the dog during the first few integral days and then they can forget he was ever supposed to be for me. \"Oh, Bailey, look, Bailey! Say hello to your new mommy and daddy and sister! Oh, that\u0027s a good boy!\" The shelter volunteer is this huge woman who slobbers nearly as much, if not more than, the many dogs surrounding us. Most of them are barking like crazy and there\u0027s something about the sound that goes straight to my stomach. The shelter is too small for the number of animals here and it\u0027s hot. I snap my fingers to make the feeling go away and glance at Bailey, who stares at me with these big golden-brown eyes. For a second, it\u0027s weird. I feel like I\u0027m doing something good, but not just for me. \"Now, Bailey, you be good, you hear me?\" The woman kneels and gives Bailey such a long hug I think he\u0027ll suffocate and die. \"We\u0027ll miss you...\" Oh my God, I think she\u0027s crying. Sure enough, when she stands, her eyes are bright and her cheeks are damp. Lame, especially considering they were gearing Bailey up to die in a couple of days anyway. The woman passes the leash to Dad, stifles another sob and wishes us well. Bailey\u0027s strangely calm about the whole thing. Even the car ride home. Maybe he\u0027ll be such a good dog we won\u0027t even know we have him. When we get home, he explores each room at his leisure, sniffing at anything and everything, every nook and cranny. He does it with a practiced disinterest and I wonder what his deal is. His last owner was abusive. Bailey edges up to the door of my room. \"Bailey.\" He turns and looks at me. \"No.\" I block his path and close the door so he can\u0027t get in. And then I say it again: \"No. That\u0027s my room. You\u0027re not allowed in there.\" He just looks at me and wags his tail. I hold my hand out and he sniffs it. \"So what did you do that no one wanted you, huh?\" I crouch down and scratch him under the chin, behind the ears. I think he likes it; I don\u0027t know. We\u0027ve never had a pet before. \"One of you should take him for a walk soon,\" I call down the hall to my parents. \"I would, but I can\u0027t on this foot.\" Mom and Dad decide to make it a family outing and walk him together. It\u0027s already working. I have to sneak out later that night. I lock my bedroom door and crawl out the window. The trip to Chris\u0027s takes longer with a sore ankle and sneaking around his house becomes less graceful, but I wind up in the woods all the same, on my hands and knees, digging while the ghost music thrums in the background. I don\u0027t throw up this time, but there\u0027s a feeling in the pit of my gut that tells me I could. After a while, I stop looking. There\u0027s nothing here. I know that. I know that. But there was something here.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cracked-up-to-be/page-8.html","bookId":1897,"book":{"id":1897,"title":"Cracked Up To Be","description":"Storyline: When \"Perfect\" Parker Fadley starts drinking at school and failing her classes, all of St. Peter\u0027s High goes on alert.
