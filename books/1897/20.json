I give him a death glare.\\n\\n \"Hi, Mom.\"\\n\\n \"Why couldn\u0027t you ask me that yourself?\" she demands.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. But I got a hundred percent on my math test.\"\\n\\n \"Are you being serious or are you joking?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not joking. I can show you the test later tonight.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not going to be drinking over there or anything, are you?\"\\n\\n \"No, Mom. Chris said his parents will be there.\"\\n\\n \"Well, you know the Ellorys. They may be there, but they\u0027re not--\"\\n\\n \"Okay, forget it. I\u0027ll see you after school.\" Yes.\\n\\n \"No, no, no,\" she says quickly. \"Go and have a good time. I\u0027m proud of you, Parker--for the test. And I didn\u0027t know you and Chris were still on speaking terms. That\u0027s good--these are good things. Go have fun. Your father and I love you.\"\\n\\n I close my eyes. \"Bye.\"\\n\\n FOURTEEN\\n\\n I can\u0027t figure out what\u0027s stopping me from just ditching Chris, Becky and Jake and going home while they stand in front of the shelf full of new releases, trying to decide what movie to rent. Suddenly, we\u0027re a group. It makes me sick. I head over to the horror section and try to remember how to breathe and that\u0027s where Jake finds me ten minutes later, my eyes closed, snapping my fingers.\\n\\n Breathe in.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ve picked the movie,\" he says. Out. \"Chris is paying now.\"\\n\\n \"Okay.\" In. I open my eyes.\\n\\n He extends his hand, like for me to take, and when I don\u0027t, he drops it and it\u0027s awkward. That\u0027s what happens when you sort of tell someone it\u0027s okay if they\u0027ve kissed you and it\u0027s okay if it happens again, but you don\u0027t tell them if it\u0027s okay to do couply things like hold hands and, I guess, care.\\n\\n \"Okay,\" I repeat. \"Let\u0027s go.\"\\n\\n \"Wait.\"\\n\\n \"Stop following me.\" Slam. \"I said get away from me!\"\\n\\n I turn my head in the direction of the noise. It takes such an effort, I think I must be dying. I feel like it. I blink slowly, several times, until I can sort of focus on a pair of people silhouetted by the moonlight filtering in through the window blinds.\\n\\n \"Nothing is going on between me and Jenny Morse--\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not what Parker said!\"\\n\\n I close my eyes.\\n\\n \"What? You\u0027re taking Parker\u0027s word for this? She\u0027s drunk off her ass! When we dragged her in here she was telling us what a beautiful person Becky is! I am not fucking Jenny Morse!\"\\n\\n \"Oh, really? Because that\u0027s not what Jenny Morse told me and she wasn\u0027t drunk off her ass when she said it!\"\\n\\n She starts to cry.\\n\\n \"Oh, Jesus, Jessie. Don\u0027t cry, please...\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t even look at you right now. Get out.\"\\n\\n \"No, please, Jess--we can figure this out. I\u0027m not leaving this room until we do. Don\u0027t do this. Please.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s nothing to figure out, Evan.\"\\n\\n \"What does that mean?\"\\n\\n Silence.\\n\\n \"I asked you what that meant.\"\\n\\n \"What do you think it means? I don\u0027t want you here. Get. Out.\"\\n\\n All of a sudden I\u0027m being jerked upright. My stomach lurches. I try to tell whichever one of them it is to stop and leave me alone, but I can\u0027t move my mouth.\\n\\n \"Parker, sit up. You can\u0027t stay on your back because if you get sick--\" Jessie sobs and taps my cheek, once, twice, three times. Stop. I want to sleep. \"Parker, come on.\"\\n\\n \"I hope she chokes.\"\\n\\n \"Nice, Evan. Would you just leave?\"\\n\\n \"Not until you talk to me about this.\" \"If I talk to you about this now, I\u0027ll just say something that you really won\u0027t like--\"\\n\\n Their voices disappear and so does everything until seconds, minutes, hours later, I don\u0027t know, Evan\u0027s shaking me, grabbing me roughly by the shoulders.\\n\\n I try to push him off me, but my arms don\u0027t work. I think he\u0027s crying.\\n\\n \"--Because you couldn\u0027t keep your goddamn mouth shut--\"\\n\\n \"Jessie.\"\\n\\n I open my eyes. I\u0027m pressed up against Jake\u0027s left side and the flat screen mounted to the wall is rolling the end credits for the movie I didn\u0027t watch. I rub my eyes and straighten up. Chris and Becky stare at me.\\n\\n \"Welcome back,\" Jake says.\\n\\n \"Trust you guys to pick the most boring movie in the whole store,\" I grumble.\\n\\n \"It kept the rest of us awake.\"\\n\\n I lean forward, rest my head in my hands and try to shake the sleep off.\\n\\n \"Who were you dreaming about?\" Chris asks.\\n\\n My eyes travel from him to Becky.\\n\\n \"Nothing. No one.\" I stand. \"I\u0027m going to get some air.\"\\n\\n \"Come back in soon,\" Chris says. \"We\u0027re popping out the bubbly.\"\\n\\n \"Really?\"\\n\\n \"Coke\u0027s bubbly, isn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n Becky giggles and rests her head against his shoulder. He puts an arm around her.\\n\\n I\u0027ve never met a girl so content to be a growth.\\n\\n Outside, I stand in front of the woods, but I don\u0027t go in. All I can think about is getting caught, the cameras that could be recording my every move, that memory-dream and Bailey\u0027s my dog and Evan\u0027s coming back and there\u0027s a bottle of Jack in my locker Becky gave me and Jake\u0027s allowed to kiss me and this isn\u0027t at all how things are supposed to be going. I wanted to be alone. It\u0027s safer that way.\\n\\n After twenty minutes or so, I hear footsteps behind me.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve kissed Jake,\" I say.\\n\\n \"I know.\"\\n\\n I turn and there\u0027s Chris, all washed-out in blue moonlight.\\n\\n \"He told me because he felt guilty,\" he explains. \"I told him to go for it.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t like you with Becky. She\u0027s not a very nice girl.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t like you with Jake. He\u0027s not me.\"\\n\\n \"Do you remember that party at the end of junior year...\"\\n\\n I trail off and look up. The stars are out tonight, full force. They\u0027re pretty.\\n\\n Of course he remembers.\\n\\n \"How could I forget?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m a different person now.\"\\n\\n He regards me for a long time before he says, \"No, you\u0027re not.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, I am. I am so, so far away from all of that.\" I don\u0027t even know why I\u0027m saying this. It just feels like I should. \"It\u0027s all totally behind me.\" \"Whatever you say.\" He holds out his hand. \"Let\u0027s get back to the house.\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s nicer than me, though.\"\\n\\n \"Who?\"\\n\\n \"Becky.\"\\n\\n \"Come on, Parker. Let\u0027s go in.\"\\n\\n \"Wait; I--\"\\n\\n I turn back to the woods before I realize what I\u0027m doing. I didn\u0027t even get to--\\n\\n \"Are you okay?\"\\n\\n \"No. What?\" I want to shake myself. Stop looking over there; you can\u0027t go over there, so stop. I run my hand over the bracelet on my wrist. There\u0027s nothing else there that I don\u0027t have. \"I mean, yes. I\u0027m just tired. I was hard on you, wasn\u0027t I? I never let you get away with anything.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, but you never let anyone get away with anything.\"\\n\\n \"You were worried about me.\"\\n\\n \"I worry about you.\"\\n\\n \"You know, even when I was really hard on people and not very nice, they always thanked me afterward because you couldn\u0027t argue with the results.\" I kick at the ground and give a bitter laugh. \"Couldn\u0027t argue with perfection.\"\\n\\n \"You were running yourself into the ground.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t want anyone else\u0027s mistakes jeopardizing my track record. And God forbid I made a mistake. Because if it ever turned out wrong, what would that say about me? I mean, what would happen?\"\\n\\n \"The world would end. You wouldn\u0027t even know how to cope,\" Chris says lightly. \"And that\u0027s what did happen.\"\\n\\n \"No, it didn\u0027t.\" I shake my head. \"That\u0027s what I\u0027m trying to tell you: I\u0027m not Perfect Parker Fadley anymore. I never was. I know who I am now and I\u0027m more in control of my life than I\u0027ve ever been.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re a perfect mess. You even have to do that perfectly.\"\\n\\n \"Look, I\u0027m trying to tell you not to worry,\" I say impatiently.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll do what I like.\" He sighs. \"We should really go in.\"\\n\\n Becky and Jake are talking happily when Chris and I return to the house. They each have a glass of Coke. Chris pours one for me.\\n\\n \"So,\" Becky says as we crowd around the island. It feels like those moments after everyone has left the party and before you start cleaning up. \"Ms. Abernathy told me all these old cheers the squad used to do, like, way back in the day, so at the next game, we\u0027re going totally retro. Old-fashioned music, chants, everything. I think it\u0027ll be great, like nothing we\u0027ve done before.\"\\n\\n \"What about the outfits?\" Chris asks. \"You\u0027re not going to go retro with those, are you? When Abernathy was a cheerleader the skirts went down to the ankles.\"\\n\\n The guys laugh like Chris has told an amazingly funny joke.\\n\\n \"Oh, don\u0027t you worry, Chris,\" Becky says, touching his arm. \"You\u0027ll be able to see our gitch. Gitch? Gitches? Is it `gitches\u0027 in plural?\"\\n\\n I raise my glass. \"Whatever it is, it\u0027s classy.\"\\n\\n \"I know.\" She eyes me. \"What do you think, really? Think it\u0027s a good idea?\"\\n\\n I shrug. \"Can\u0027t be any worse than the cheers you\u0027ve been doing lately.\" \"I can\u0027t believe you were cheerleading captain,\" Jake says to me.\\n\\n Becky smirks. \"Cheerleading Nazi.\"\\n\\n I set my glass down.\\n\\n \"Jake, walk me home? That way Chris doesn\u0027t have to get the car out.\"\\n\\n So he does.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s nice out,\" he says, as we tromp down the driveway. \"I mean, it\u0027s definitely getting warmer out.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah...\"\\n\\n \"My mom doesn\u0027t talk to me.\"\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"My mom doesn\u0027t talk to me,\" Jake says. \"Because I chose my dad. He cheated on her with Wanda. I guess she thought I\u0027d stay with her because of what he did, but I\u0027ve always had more in common with him.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cracked-up-to-be/page-20.html","bookId":1897,"book":{"id":1897,"title":"Cracked Up To Be","description":"Storyline: When \"Perfect\" Parker Fadley starts drinking at school and failing her classes, all of St. Peter\u0027s High goes on alert.
