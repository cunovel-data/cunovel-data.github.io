So are you still best friends with him or what?\" \"Why?\" \"I have to know.\" He glances at his wristwatch. \"I don\u0027t have time for the `things change\u0027 speech, Parker.\" \"So give me the CliffNotes version.\" \"Okay. You ready?\" he asks. I nod. \"Things change.\" \"Chris.\" He makes an exasperated noise. \"He just got back and there happens to be this event in Whitney that I think I\u0027d probably have a better time at if I took Jake along. Over Evan. Satisfied?\" I shake my head. \"No.\" \"Why?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" Everything feels wrong. I start snapping my fingers again. \"But what about me? How do you feel about me? You\u0027re still hung up on me, aren\u0027t you?\" \"Parker--\" \"This is your fault,\" I say. \"You made me go to the dance.\" His mouth drops open. I go to the girls\u0027 washroom and pace because my brain is telling me to do something and this is it. Pace. This is so annoying; last week I had the whole school and everyone in it and now things are different and I hate it. The door opens, but I pace in spite of it. Anyway, it\u0027s Becky, so it doesn\u0027t matter. \"Oh,\" she says when she sees me. She walks over to the sink, pencil case in hand because that\u0027s where she keeps her makeup. \"Hi.\" I watch, still pacing, as she takes out her lipstick and gets to work. \"What do you and Chris talk about?\" The lipstick hovers above her lower lip. She stares at me in the mirror. \"None of your business?\" \"Do you talk about, like, the deep stuff? Important stuff? Or just basketball and cheerleading? Or is it a sex thing and you don\u0027t talk at all?\" She does her lips and caps her lipstick before she even dignifies that with an answer, which drives me crazy. \"What did you and Chris talk about?\" she asks. \"Everything,\" I say quickly. \"Our conversations were deep and profound.\" \"Would you quit pacing?\" I can\u0027t stop. I want to tell her that, but I don\u0027t. And I wouldn\u0027t stop anyway, now that I know she wants me to. \"Do you talk about Evan and stuff?\" \"And stuff,\" she repeats faintly, smiling a little. \"And stuff? Yeah, we talk about Evan `and stuff.\u0027\" \"Do you talk about me?\" She crosses her arms. \"What is wrong with you, Parker?\" \"Is Chris over me? I mean--\" I stop pacing. \"Is he?\" \"Your name doesn\u0027t come up so much anymore.\" I snap my fingers. Both of them. Again and again. \"Just like that?\" \"Just like that.\" \"I don\u0027t believe you.\" I leave the washroom as the bell rings, Becky calling after me. I\u0027ve got my usual meeting with Grey, and for once in my life I\u0027m glad. Finally, someone I can predict. I enter her office, sit down, and we say nothing and I feel a little better. At least there\u0027s still one person in this school who can be counted on. After the first fifteen minutes of quiet, she starts flipping through a magazine. I blink. I\u0027m on the lawn, by the bushes where I threw up. I blink again and I\u0027m next to Chris. I blink again and Jessie\u0027s dancing, making out with a new mystery guy, different from the last one. Where do they all come from? I blink again and Evan\u0027s there, screaming at both of them. I blink again and someone\u0027s pulling Chris away because something\u0027s broken, a lamp or a vase. I blink again and I\u0027m alone, in front of the drinks table set out on the lawn. I\u0027m here because I\u0027m thirsty. My hands drift over the booze and go straight for the bowl of punch for the designated driver. I fill up a cup with shaking hands and drink it, then another. It\u0027s passion fruit or strawberry Hawaiian something and it tastes good. Then, a voice behind me: \"Someone spiked that, like, an hour ago.\" I drop the cup and moan. \"Oh, God.\" Becky laughs. \"Good one.\" I shuffle over to a soft patch of grass and sit down. Someone will probably have to peel my alcohol- bloated corpse off the lawn come morning. \"Chris wants me to get you inside,\" Becky says, grabbing my arms and pulling. She stumbles forward and giggles, her face in my face, beer on her breath. \"Come on.\" \"Where\u0027s Jessie?\" \"Somewhere. I was just talking to her,\" she says brightly, pulling on my arm again. She gives up and sits beside me. \"She and Evan are so over, by the way. Well done, Parker. I should console him.\" \"You would.\" Then I remember it\u0027s my mission to fix what I did, because it\u0027s wrong and I don\u0027t do things that are wrong. The goal swims in front of my mind and starts to drift away, but I try really hard to hold on to it. And then I close my eyes. Maybe after I sleep. \"Did you see them fighting by the pool? So over,\" she says again, giggling. My head snaps up. \"Big surprise. Me and Evan, we\u0027d make a much better match.\" \"Parasite,\" I say. I blink several times, trying to snap myself out of this fuzzy place. \"It\u0027s never going to happen.\" \"It will. We have tons in common.\" Tipsy Becky is a thousand times more annoying than sober Becky, and that\u0027s saying something. \"So when are you going to relinquish captaining duties to me, anyway?\" \"Fuck off and die first and then we\u0027ll talk,\" I mumble, feeling my head go forward. It wants to sleep. No. I jerk upright. It doesn\u0027t really help. \"I\u0027ll be captain in a week.\" Her voice is hard, too hard, and it dawns on me through the murk that she\u0027s only pretending to be drunk, which is one of her favorite party tricks because she\u0027s under this bizarre delusion it\u0027s cute. \"You\u0027ll finally snap or the rest of the girls will vote you off the squad. Whichever comes first.\" \"Brave to say so in front of me.\" I struggle to push myself up from the ground, but it\u0027s just not happening. \"I could ruin your life.\" \"You won\u0027t remember any of this,\" she says. \"What makes you think you deserve to be captain?\" \"I\u0027m nicer than you, for starters.\" She goes quiet for so long I think that\u0027s it, I can pass out, but no, she starts talking again. \"I\u0027m nice to everyone and no one gives a damn. You tear people down and act like you\u0027re doing them a favor and they act like you\u0027re Jesus because they\u0027re stupid enough to believe it. At least they\u0027re starting to catch on now. Not even being Chris\u0027s girlfriend is helping you. And I\u0027m so looking forward to making everyone realize how much better they could\u0027ve had it with me.\" \"That\u0027s really pathetic.\" I have to force every word through my teeth. \"And I\u0027ll remember this, Becky.\" She snorts. \"Where\u0027s Jessie?\" I use Becky\u0027s shoulder to get into standing position. The world tilts. For a second, I think I\u0027ll be sick, but I\u0027m not and I\u0027m standing and it\u0027s a miracle. \"Becky, where is she?\" \"I talked to her for a minute, after she and Evan fought. She was crying her eyes out. She said she was going to run away. Drama Queen.\" Becky looks up at me and smiles. \"Nice going, Parker.\" \"Where did she go?\" Becky points in the direction of the woods. NINETEEN They could be talking about me, like, right now. Chris and Jake. I hate that. So after I choke down dinner I decide to take Bailey for a walk. I slip on my shoes, call him from the living room and hook him up to the leash. He figures out what\u0027s going on and squirms and slobbers all over me. \"I thought dogs were supposed to mellow with age,\" I tell him. He flicks his tongue at my face and I back away just in time. \"Jesus, Bailey.\" \"Parker, don\u0027t talk like that in the house,\" Mom says. \"It\u0027s disrespectful.\" Jesus, Jesus, Jesus. \"I\u0027ll see you guys later.\" \"Have a nice walk, sweetheart.\" Dad. \"Be home by nine.\" Mom. I don\u0027t say anything. \"I mean it, Parker.\" \"Yeah, sure,\" I say, and then, for good measure: \"Whatever.\" So I leave and we walk, and it\u0027s an okay walk. I steer Bailey onto Chris\u0027s street without realizing it. Actually, that\u0027s a lie. I know what I\u0027m doing. I know what I\u0027m doing and it\u0027s stupid. But Bailey pulls me forward at a happy trot, his tongue always and forever hanging out of his mouth. The closer we get to Chris\u0027s house, the more uneasy I feel, but maybe I\u0027d feel better to pass it once and then go home. So that\u0027s what I\u0027ll do. We\u0027re practically there when this string of cars go by, one after the other, and I feel criminal, caught. It makes me want to turn back, but I can\u0027t because the thought is there, that I should pass the house. So I have to. This is so stupid. And then this explosion of sound fills the street, like a small bomb going off--an engine backfiring--and Bailey yelps and tears loose because I\u0027m not holding the leash tightly enough. He runs into the road and before I can call him back or go after him, there are all these other sounds, smaller sounds, this dull thud, squealing tires. And then silence. Just like that. He lies in the middle of the street, his legs splayed out before him the way they are when he sleeps on the living-room floor. I go to him, kneel down in front him. He stares up at me, pitiful but alive. But what kind of-- What kind of asshole hits a dog and drives away? Bailey shudders. \"Bailey. Bailey--Bailey...\" I spew his name. I say it a thousand times in three seconds. I rest my hand on his stomach and it comes back red and he makes a noise, this awful whimper. \"Stop that,\" I snap. \"You\u0027re fine. We\u0027ll just get you off the--\" I wrap my arms around him so I can drag him off the road, but I don\u0027t have the strength to lift him and my shirt gets red. I have to let him go.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cracked-up-to-be/page-26.html","bookId":1897,"book":{"id":1897,"title":"Cracked Up To Be","description":"Storyline: When \"Perfect\" Parker Fadley starts drinking at school and failing her classes, all of St. Peter\u0027s High goes on alert.
