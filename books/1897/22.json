It feels like lead, but at least I\u0027m not cemented to the couch like before, which is good because I\u0027m going to be sick.\n I force myself off the couch, and fumble my way to the door, trying to remember which bathroom is closest to the living room while at the same time vowing never to drink again because I\u0027ve been here a million times and I should know which bathroom is closest to the living room, but my head feels awful and I just can\u0027t think.\n I push through the door and bump into God knows how many people as I weave down the hall. Mostly all of them laugh at me, or maybe they\u0027ve just hit the Feel Good Stage of the party where everything\u0027s funny. Who knows. My stomach flip-flops.\n I cover my mouth.\n The closest bathroom is occupied and there\u0027s a lo-ong line and there are three bathrooms upstairs, but I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll make it to any of them in time. The music is so loud it forces any other potential plans of action right out of my brain and I stumble through the kitchen, head outside, take a few uncertain steps toward some bushes and throw up until there\u0027s nothing left in my stomach to throw up.\n And then I start dry-heaving, which is worse.\n When it\u0027s over, I sit back on the grass, trying to ignore the sour taste in my mouth and wondering how I\u0027ll make it back to my safe haven in the living room. And that\u0027s when I spot Jessie by the pool, Jessie laughing it up with some guy I don\u0027t know. He looks older than us and she\u0027s in full party mode, probably buzzed, and the way she leans into him is all wrong because it\u0027s how she leans into a guy when she wants to fuck him. This is wrong. I did this. I focus on getting upright again. I have to fix it.\n \"Parker?\"\n \"I\u0027m getting by,\" I tell her.\n What else am I supposed to say?\n \"Well, that\u0027s good. Because things are happening, aren\u0027t they? Evan Corman is coming back. That must be nice for you and your friends.\" Grey\u0027s voice is like nails on a chalkboard. \"I saw him when he met with Principal Henley. He seems eager to get things together. You two could help each other.\"\n \"How?\"\n \"Well, given the circumstances...\"\n \"You mean because he tried to kill himself, you think we can help each other?\" I can\u0027t believe I\u0027m sitting through this for a dance. \"It won\u0027t help.\" \"Why not?\"\n \"Because Evan didn\u0027t really want to die. And mine was an accident.\"\n \"Evan didn\u0027t want to die?\" she repeats slowly. Stupid. \"The evidence certainly suggests otherwise.\"\n \"He didn\u0027t,\" I say. \"He planned it right down to getting caught.\"\n Stupid, stupid. And then I decide to give it to her because when people are this stupid they should be told every once in a while.\n \"When he got in the bath with the razors, he knew his mom would find him before he bled out,\" I say impatiently. \"It was more a gesture than anything. Like, `This is how far I would go for absolution,\u0027 and everyone was like, `Wow, fine, you\u0027re forgiven.\u0027 And that\u0027s how he lives with himself. He did his bit and he goes on like before. Which doesn\u0027t help me at all.\"\n \"And is this--\" She makes this sweeping gesture around the room, like she\u0027s gathering up all the things I\u0027ve done. \"Is this your bit?\"\n God, she\u0027s so stupid.\n \"Look, can I go to the semi-formal or not?\"\n She stares at me a long time.\n \"Wait here.\"\n She leaves the room. I sit in the hard plastic chair and wait, wait, wait for, like, ten minutes and then she comes back.\n \"You can go to the semi-formal,\" she says, shutting the door. \"You can go to the semi-formal, but if you\u0027re on anything less than your best behavior--\"\n \"I know; I know. I won\u0027t graduate.\"\n \"That\u0027s right. You won\u0027t.\"\n The bell rings. I head for the door.\n \"Thanks,\" I say without looking at her.\n \"English homework,\" Becky says, handing me a piece of paper. I grab it and she heads on her merry way. \"See you Monday or something.\"\n \"See you tomorrow,\" I call after her.\n She stops, turns and gives me a hilariously quizzical look.\n It could be worth it for this alone.\n \"What?\"\n \"I\u0027ll see you tomorrow. For the semi-formal? You, me, Chris and Jake.\" I force a big smile at her. \"I\u0027m really looking forward to it.\"\n I\u0027m such a bitch, but Becky makes it so easy.\n SIXTEEN\n Hair.\n I stand in front of the full-length mirror mounted on the back of my closet door and try to figure out what I\u0027m going to do with my hair. Jake won\u0027t be here for another two and a half hours, but any girl knows you need at least three to look your best for a semi-formal. And I haven\u0027t even showered yet.\n So I do that.\n And then I stand in front of the full-length mirror mounted on the back of my closet door and try to figure out what I\u0027m going to do with my wet hair.\n Blow-dry it, probably. For starters.\n So I do that while vaguely recalling a time I made checklists on dance nights. I reduced getting ready to a list of tasks, all of them allotted certain amounts of time for completion. As I checked off each one, I got to enjoy a warm feeling of accomplishment for an allotted 1.5 seconds.\n But not tonight. The lack of structure disorients me. I decide to leave my hair down and curl the ends. While I wait for the iron to warm, I pick out my best black dress from the closet. It has off-the- shoulder short sleeves and stops just before the knees. Decent, but sexy, and miraculously uneaten by moths. I have a feeling it\u0027s not going to fit what with the ten pounds I\u0027ve gained and the fact that I haven\u0027t done anything remotely physical since I quit the cheerleading squad, but unfortunately it does fit. Kind of. My boobs look desperate to break free of the soft satin material that binds them, and if I sit I have a sneaking suspicion the whole dress could split down the back. But if that happens, then hey, at least I\u0027ll have an excuse to leave early.\n The dress (barely) on, I begin to work on my hair, which is a longer process than I\u0027d like it to be or ever remember it being. It\u0027s because I don\u0027t have a list.\n And the makeup. That\u0027s another beast entirely.\n How did I do this every day for school? I didn\u0027t need a checklist then. The routine was so ingrained in me because it was so important because--why?\n Because I had to look perfect, of course.\n I pick through the collection of makeup on my desk. Foundation, under-eye concealer, lipstick, lip gloss, eyeliner, eye shadow, mascara and blush. I settle for clear gloss and mascara and then stand in front of the mirror and inspect myself.\n It\u0027s good, I guess.\n \"Parker!\" Mom shouts. \"Parker, they\u0027ve just pulled up!\"\n I grab my black clutch and hear Mom cooing all three of them into the house before I\u0027m halfway down the stairs. I\u0027ve barely stepped into the living room when Bailey comes bounding at me, lampshade tight around his neck.\n \"Bailey, stop!\" I say before he can jump up. He comes to a screeching halt and I reward him with a pat because I can\u0027t help it, he looks that ridiculous. \"Good dog.\"\n \"Look at that! You know, he doesn\u0027t even fetch my slippers anymore,\" Dad says from his recliner, smiling. \"You look beautiful, honey.\"\n I bring my clutch up to my chest. \"Dad, don\u0027t.\"\n \"Well, you do. Have fun at the dance.\" He gives me a look. \"And behave.\"\n \"I wouldn\u0027t dream of doing anything but.\"\n I give Bailey one last pat on the head and make my way into the kitchen, where Mom\u0027s having an animated conversation with Jake, Chris and Becky. She has the camera out. Joy. I clear my throat. They stop talking and look at me. \"Oh, Parker!\" Mom cries. \"This is the best you\u0027ve looked in ages!\"\n Becky smirks, but not for long. We simultaneously ascertain that I look better than she does, even packing weight. Just because one is an affinity for pink doesn\u0027t mean she should wear it, but boy, is she. Pink hair accessories, jewelry, makeup, dress, shoes, clutch. It\u0027s one those hard, bright pinks, too. Not the soft, pretty kind.\n I mean it\u0027s blindingly awful and awfully satisfying all at the same time.\n \"I just want to get a picture of all of you, really quick! You look so nice!\"\n Mom ushers us into a line and places me between Chris and Jake, who both look very handsome. They\u0027ve opted for black suits. Chris\u0027s hair is slicked back and Jake\u0027s is loose, like it always is. Chris smells like pine; and Jake, like paper. For a minute, I can\u0027t remember whom I\u0027m supposed to be spending the evening with.\n Jake.\n Mom raises the camera to her eye and says, \"Smile!\"\n \"Thank God that\u0027s over,\" Becky says as we cross the lawn to Chris\u0027s car. She glares at me. \"Your mom is such a freak, Parker.\"\n \"Well, I think it\u0027s sweet that she wanted to get a memento of this grand occasion,\" Jake says cheerfully. \"Your mom didn\u0027t take any pictures, Becky.\"\n She snorts. Chris opens the driver\u0027s side door and gives me this look.\n \"I\u0027ve seen that dress before,\" he says, letting his eyes travel over me. \"But I don\u0027t think you\u0027ve ever worn it quite like this.\"\n I glance at Becky. She clenches her jaw, climbs into the passenger\u0027s side and slams the door shut. The night can only get better from here.\n \"I\u0027ve gained weight,\" I tell him. \"All in my boobs.\"\n \"Looks good on you,\" Chris says as he gets in the car.\n Jake opens the back door for me. What a gentleman.\n \"You look really beautiful. I like your hair.\"\n He says it in a voice I don\u0027t really deserve and it catches me off guard. I feel my face heat up and bring a hand to one of my curls. It\u0027s a weird moment.\n \"Thanks. You look nice.\" I reach out and push a stray piece of hair away from his eyes. \"I like your hair, too. It looks very complicated.\"\n We smile at each other and get in the car.\n The dance has a ten-dollar entrance fee, the music is loud and bad and the auditorium is sparkly, purple and hot. Chris gives me a longing look as Becky drags him over to the popular corner. Just because we came together doesn\u0027t mean we stay together, especially when I look a thousand times better than Becky does. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cracked-up-to-be/page-22.html","bookId":1897,"book":{"id":1897,"title":"Cracked Up To Be","description":"Storyline: \n When \"Perfect\" Parker Fadley starts drinking at school and failing her classes, all of St. Peter\u0027s High goes on alert.
