You\u0027re her son.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, but it\u0027s more a case of her having to forgive me, isn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n \"But are you sorry?\"\\n\\n He pauses. He looks sad. \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Why are you telling me this?\"\\n\\n \"Because...\" He shrugs. \"I don\u0027t know. Because I want you to know we\u0027ve all got something?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, Jake. You\u0027re so melodramatic and angsty.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, we have a lot in common.\" He shoves his hands in his pockets. \"Did you mean what you said before?\"\\n\\n \"What did I say before?\"\\n\\n \"The more I know about you, the less interesting I am...\"\\n\\n \"I guess not,\" I say. \"Lucky you.\"\\n\\n \"Lucky me,\" he repeats. \"I\u0027m going to kiss you.\"\\n\\n So he does.\\n\\n FIFTEEN\\n\\n Something\u0027s not right.\\n\\n I set my book bag down and listen. There are the usual sounds coming from the kitchen; Mom puttering around, getting dinner ready maybe. That\u0027s normal, almost welcome. But something\u0027s missing. Not right.\\n\\n I round the corner. My perfect test is stuck to the face of the fridge, the way my childhood drawings used to be. Mom\u0027s gearing up to do the dishes, but Dad\u0027s not at his usual spot at the table.\\n\\n And Bailey didn\u0027t run to greet me when I stepped through the door.\\n\\n \"Where\u0027s Bailey?\" I ask.\\n\\n Mom looks up.\\n\\n \"Your father had to take him to the vet.\"\\n\\n \"What happened?\"\\n\\n \"He got into a fight with another dog at the park.\"\\n\\n \"Is he hurt?\"\\n\\n She nods. \"He might need stitches.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s not--\" I swallow. \"He\u0027s not going to die, is he?\" She gets all hopeful around the eyes.\\n\\n \"Are you worried?\"\\n\\n Why do people do that? Turn nothing into something?\\n\\n \"I couldn\u0027t care less either way.\"\\n\\n She flinches and turns back to the sink. As soon as I leave the room, she might cry about how much she doesn\u0027t understand me anymore, how much she wants her old daughter back, but she\u0027s not coming back. I went too far, but sometimes you have to.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s not going to die,\" I say.\\n\\n But she doesn\u0027t look at me and Bailey comes home with stitches on his hip and a lampshade around his neck so he won\u0027t gnaw at them. I take pity on him and I let him sleep in my room.\\n\\n \"Are you going to the dance?\"\\n\\n I slam my locker shut.\\n\\n \"What are you talking about?\"\\n\\n \"You know...\" Chris wiggles his hips in a poor imitation of dancing. \"The dance this weekend. You going?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not following.\"\\n\\n He rolls his eyes, grabs me by the hand and drags me down the hall to the entrance corridor. There, on the wall, is a bright pink poster advertising the semi-formal this weekend. Be there or be square.\\n\\n \"There are only, like, a half a million of these all over the school,\" he says.\\n\\n \"Semi-formal already,\" I say, staring at the poster. \"How about that.\"\\n\\n \"So are you going or what?\"\\n\\n \"Well, I would, but no one\u0027s asked me.\" I jut my lower lip out, but his eyes light up, so I drop the expression and snort. \"Are you kidding me? Of course I\u0027m not.\"\\n\\n \"I have it on good authority that Jake\u0027s going to ask you, though.\" \"Why does Jake insist on breaking his own heart?\"\\n\\n \"Just go,\" Chris says, groaning. \"I\u0027m taking Becky. We\u0027ll all go together, leave together. It\u0027ll be fun times. Supervised fun times. How can you resist?\"\\n\\n \"Easily. Contrary to popular belief, Chris, I don\u0027t like spending time with you, Becky or Jake. Especially Becky. In case you\u0027ve forgotten, she annoys the fuck out of me. She\u0027s not a good argument for my going to the dance.\"\\n\\n \"So show her up!\"\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"Wear that really nice black dress you\u0027ve got, fix your hair up all nice and show her up. She\u0027d hate that.\"\\n\\n I can\u0027t help but laugh. \"She hated that.\"\\n\\n \"There, see? I just gave you a reason to go.\"\\n\\n \"If Becky knew you said that, I don\u0027t think she\u0027d like you very much.\"\\n\\n \"You won\u0027t tell her,\" he says. \"And I think you should go.\"\\n\\n \"Why do you care?\"\\n\\n \"Because I\u0027m still in love with you, of course. What else could it possibly be?\" Before I can say something snide, he laughs. \"Haven\u0027t you done the whole Alienate Everyone thing long enough? I mean, how much longer are you gonna keep at it?\"\\n\\n \"Uh, I don\u0027t know--until it works?\"\\n\\n \"You used to like going to dances,\" he reminds me. The bell rings and we head for homeroom. \"Bet you still do.\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t take this anymore.\"\\n\\n \"Can\u0027t take what?\" I ask, even though I know.\\n\\n Jake and I are so done with the sketching part of our landscape, but because we haven\u0027t figured out what to do next we spend most of the period taking turns tracing the same set of rocks. I don\u0027t know why he\u0027s so freaked out about it. It sure beats working.\\n\\n He gestures to the paper.\\n\\n \"Unity and disparity. We need a plan.\"\\n\\n I rest my head on the desk. \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"Because that\u0027s the project!\"\\n\\n \"Head up, Fadley!\" Norton yells. \"Nap time\u0027s not for another fifteen minutes!\"\\n\\n Everyone snickers. I raise my head.\\n\\n \"So-o-o...,\" Jake says, and I can tell by the way he protracts the o he\u0027s getting ready to ask me to the semi-formal. Sure enough: \"What are semi-formals like at St. Peter\u0027s?\"\\n\\n Why are guys so predictable?\\n\\n \"And what\u0027s a semi-formal, anyway?\" he asks quickly, before I can answer his first question. \"Does that mean dress nice from the waist down?\"\\n\\n \"Something like that, yeah,\" I answer.\\n\\n \"Are you going?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m probably not allowed.\" \"That\u0027s convenient.\"\\n\\n He stops tracing the rocks and I pick up where he left off.\\n\\n \"No, really,\" I say. \"I\u0027m not sure if I\u0027d be allowed. I\u0027m not even allowed off grounds for lunch, remember? Grey and Henley would probably have to okay it, not to mention my parents. It\u0027s not as simple as me putting on my best dress and going to the dance, you know?\"\\n\\n \"And if it was?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not.\"\\n\\n \"Would you go to the semi-formal with me, Parker?\"\\n\\n I look up from my rocks. Chris is watching us from across the room. He winks and turns back to the landscape he\u0027s working on with his partner.\\n\\n I hate him for enjoying this.\\n\\n \"Uhm.\" I focus on the rocks. \"I guess.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m twenty dollars richer, thanks to you!\"\\n\\n I shut the door to Grey\u0027s office and try to figure out what she\u0027s talking about. And then I roll my eyes. She just grins.\\n\\n \"The math test?\" I guess.\\n\\n \"Principal Henley didn\u0027t think you\u0027d pass, but I knew you would.\"\\n\\n I lean against the door. I should be sitting so we can have our weekly session where I pick the lint off my skirt and determinedly maintain my silence while she stares at me, except today I have to break that silence. And all for a boy, too. How degrading.\\n\\n \"I want to go to the semi-formal tomorrow,\" I announce.\\n\\n Grey blinks.\\n\\n \"What do your parents think about that?\"\\n\\n \"They think it\u0027s a great idea.\"\\n\\n She raises both eyebrows. \"Really?\"\\n\\n \"Call them and ask.\"\\n\\n It\u0027s sort of true. Mom and Dad think going to the semi-formal with Jake and the gang is a great idea, but only because I\u0027ve already told them it was okay with the school. I wait until Friday to spring it on Grey because I don\u0027t want to give her or Henley all the time they need to think up the reasons why it\u0027s probably not a good idea.\\n\\n And they would, too, since the last dance I showed at was a disaster.\\n\\n \"Jake Gardner asked me,\" I continue. \"They think it would be good for me.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t have any plans to spike the punch again, do you?\"\\n\\n She gestures to the seat across from her and I sit.\\n\\n \"No. I\u0027ll just be there to look pretty and dance.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll have to check with Principal Henley. This is very short notice, Parker--\"\\n\\n \"But if you tell her you\u0027re okay with it, there shouldn\u0027t be a problem. Henley--Principal Henley\u0027s too busy to take a long look at a Pros and Cons list for my attending one semi-formal. You only have to give her the word.\" \"But I\u0027m not too busy for that list.\" Grey smiles in a way that doesn\u0027t thrill me. \"And we have thirty minutes of this session left. So how about you talk to me, really talk to me, and maybe you can attend the semi-formal.\"\\n\\n \"Ms. Grey!\" My eyes widen. \"That\u0027s dirty pool.\"\\n\\n And it\u0027s really not worth spending an evening with Jake in an auditorium decked out to look like something special with a bunch of people I can\u0027t even stand being around on a good day.\\n\\n But my parents think I\u0027m going.\\n\\n \"Fine,\" I say, opening my arms. \"Ask me anything.\"\\n\\n She puts her best Movie Guidance Counselor face on and leans forward.\\n\\n \"How are you?\" she asks after a beat. Oh my God. \"How are you really?\"\\n\\n When I wake up, I\u0027m still drunk.\\n\\n I\u0027ll remember this as the longest, most miserable night of my life. Chris\u0027s living room is empty, no trace of anyone having been here, but the party is still going strong outside the door because it isn\u0027t that late, I just got smashed that early. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cracked-up-to-be/page-21.html","bookId":1897,"book":{"id":1897,"title":"Cracked Up To Be","description":"Storyline: When \"Perfect\" Parker Fadley starts drinking at school and failing her classes, all of St. Peter\u0027s High goes on alert.
