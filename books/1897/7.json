I didn\u0027t even mean it or really feel it, but I couldn\u0027t stop. I could waste time analyzing that, but I won\u0027t. It got me out of the essay and it\u0027s getting me a dog. That\u0027s all that matters.\n \"The moment got away from me, I guess,\" I say.\n But Grey wants more than that, like last time, and even though I\u0027m kind of bored, like last time, I don\u0027t want to overextend myself. I need that energy to take pictures with Jake after the bell.\n Fridays are turning out to be a major pain in the ass.\n I shrug. \"Maybe it was because it felt too much like... before?\"\n \"You mentioned that last Friday, things feeling like before,\" Grey says. She opens her Parker notebook. \"It seemed to be a good thing then. What\u0027s changed?\"\n I stare at the inspirational poster tacked to the wall behind her head. Something about not giving up. Lame.\n \"I had a lot of responsibilities,\" I say. \"I was thinking about it. I was captain of the cheerleading squad, I was a straight A-plus student and, let\u0027s be honest, I was popular. All of that takes a lot of work. I did some stupid things and lost it all, but that also meant I got rid of all those responsibilities and you know what? I liked life a lot better. Before, I was suffocating. So, lately, I\u0027ve been trying for the homework thing, because I want to graduate, but that essay... every time I sat down to write it, I just couldn\u0027t because--\"\n \"You felt suffocated,\" Grey finishes.\n She\u0027s so smart. I mean, I\u0027m so smart. She\u0027s so predictable.\n \"Yeah.\"\n \"Well, I sympathize, Parker, but we can\u0027t make many more allowances for you. As it stands, we\u0027ve--\"\n \"I wasn\u0027t asking,\" I say, laughing a little. \"I mean, it\u0027s not like I cried in Lerner\u0027s on purpose.\"\n Shit. It comes out of my mouth wrong, like I did cry on purpose, which I did, but Grey\u0027s obviously not supposed to know that. And of course she catches it.\n Her face darkens.\n \"Ms. Grey!\" I bring my hand to my mouth and try to sound scandalized, to diffuse the situation. \"You don\u0027t think I did it on purpose, do you?\"\n But that comes out of my mouth wrong, too.\n \"You just don\u0027t learn, do you, Parker?\" She closes her notebook and glares at me. \"You run everyone around in circles--\"\n \"I run everyone around in circles?\"\n \"You do.\"\n \"I do?\"\n \"Stop that.\" She takes off her glasses and rubs her eyes. \"You want everyone to think your problem is what happened over the summer--\"\n \"No, that\u0027s what everyone wants to think--\"\n \"But it is your problem!\" She puts her glasses back on. \"You manipulate. You make it your excuse and that\u0027s exactly how you push it away.\"\n The party starts at eight, but I show up early so Chris and I can have sex. Another year at St. Peter\u0027s is almost behind us and we\u0027ve already slept together eight times. This will be the ninth and there\u0027s going to be a lot more sex in our future.\n We go to his bedroom. The speakers are mounted against his window and he turns on some sweet- sounding music really low and he kisses me and I kiss him back and then, I don\u0027t know, I kind of seize up.\n \"What\u0027s wrong?\"\n \"That doesn\u0027t even make any sense,\" I tell Grey.\n It\u0027s the last thing I tell her. We sit in silence until the bell rings. I feel like I should be furious with her, and I might be, but more than that, I\u0027m annoyed. I have to remind myself she wasn\u0027t there and she doesn\u0027t know a damn thing so I can\u0027t really blame her for making half-assed assertions once a week. I just wish she wouldn\u0027t.\n When I get out, Jake\u0027s waiting for me at the door.\n \"I\u0027ve got the camera,\" he says.\n \"Great.\"\n We head outside.\n I can\u0027t believe he goes on my stupid bus and I didn\u0027t even notice. \"You can sit where you normally sit,\" I tell him.\n \"Don\u0027t worry; I was going to,\" he replies. \"So do you have any idea--\"\n \"Yeah, I have an idea: please stop talking.\"\n We climb on the bus. I take my usual seat at the front and he heads for the middle. I rest my head against the window and close my eyes. I don\u0027t mean to, but I fall asleep, and fifteen minutes later Jake\u0027s shaking my shoulder and looking pretty irritated. All through art he pestered me, \"Where are we going? What are we taking pictures of...\"\n \"I think this is your stop,\" he says sarcastically.\n I rub my eyes. \"Yeah.\"\n We inch up the aisle and step onto the street. I can see my house from here, but I don\u0027t want to go through the hassle of introducing Jake to my parents because they\u0027d interpret it all wrong and it\u0027d give them false hope and, like I said before, I don\u0027t do that.\n \"We\u0027ll go this way.\" I point in the opposite direction. \"If we go down this street, turn left and walk through the park there\u0027s this kind of wooded area. Beyond that, there\u0027s a ravine. We could probably get some really good pictures there.\"\n \"We\u0027re not going to your house first?\"\n \"I don\u0027t want you to know where I live.\"\n He laughs. \"Like I give a damn. But sure, let\u0027s go to the ravine.\"\n We walk. I don\u0027t know if I should be nice to him or if this technically makes him my guest because we\u0027re near where I live and he has no idea where we are.\n \"So you and Chris really hit it off, huh?\"\n I keep my voice light and conversational, but Jake still seems to weigh every word like he\u0027s trying to figure out which one of them is poisoned.\n \"He\u0027s cool,\" he says after a while. \"I mean, he didn\u0027t treat me like a new kid, you know? We hang.\"\n \"He and Becky are going out--you know Becky, right? Becky Halprin? She\u0027s captain of the cheerleading squad. Anyway, they had a date last Friday and they\u0027re having another one this weekend, I think.\"\n \"Yeah, Saturday,\" Jake says. \"It\u0027s not really a date, though. A couple of us are going to go shoot some pool at Finn\u0027s, wherever that is.\"\n \"Finn Walters?\"\n \"Yeah, you know him?\"\n \"Yeah. He\u0027s on the chess team. He\u0027s, like, this superintellectual and yet still cool.\" It could be all the blow he deals in the boys\u0027 washrooms. \"So it\u0027s a night thing, right? When are you going? Around eight?\"\n \"Chris says he\u0027ll pick me up at--\" He stops. \"Why? Are you fishing for an invite or something? Because you\u0027re not going to get one from me.\"\n \"I\u0027ve got better things to do with a Saturday night, but thanks.\"\n \"Like what?\"\n \"Like not hanging out with you?\"\n \"Walked right into that one, didn\u0027t I?\"\n \"Yeah, you did.\"\n We laugh. And then we realize we\u0027re laughing together and then we stop and then it gets awkward. I don\u0027t do awkward well, at least mutual awkwardness, so I snap my fingers to make the feeling go away. And then I can\u0027t stop.\n Even after Jake points it out.\n \"That\u0027s really annoying,\" he says.\n So I kick it up a notch just to bug him and I keep it up until my fingers start to hurt.\n We trek through the park and enter the woods beyond it. They\u0027re not like the woods by Chris\u0027s house. They\u0027re a little denser, a little easier to get lost in, but I\u0027m not worried. I like them. Nothing bad happened here and it makes the air less polluted, somehow. It doesn\u0027t make me want to throw up.\n \"It\u0027s really great out here,\" I say without thinking. \"There\u0027s nothing--\"\n I shut my mouth.\n \"What?\" Jake asks.\n \"Nothing. We\u0027ll get good pictures out here, that\u0027s all.\"\n He reaches into his book bag and pulls out his digital camera.\n \"But not here--it\u0027s a little farther in. Give me that.\" I hold out my hand and he steps back, clutching the camera to his chest. \"Oh, come on, Jake. I\u0027m not going to steal or break it. I may not respect people, but I do respect their property.\"\n He groans and hands it to me.\n \"I must be crazy.\"\n \"You\u0027re right; you are.\"\n I take it and run and the look on his face is so great.\n \"Parker!\"\n He has no choice but to chase after me, and I have a hell of a lead. I can hear my pulse pounding in my ears and the air is cold and sharp in my lungs and I like that. I get to the ravine ages before him, scale the nearest tree--which is also the biggest and the oldest--and wriggle my way along the thickest branch out.\n The one that hovers directly above the thirty-foot drop.\n When Jake finally catches up to me, I\u0027m dangling from a pretty precarious angle, nearly upside down, and it probably looks terrifying from where he\u0027s standing.\n But it will be so worth this shot.\n \"Are you trying to kill yourself?\" he yells, panting.\n I keep my leg muscles tight around the branch so I don\u0027t, you know, die.\n \"If I was trying to kill myself, I\u0027d make sure you weren\u0027t here.\"\n \"Parker, get down from there. You\u0027re making me nervous--\"\n \"Pansy.\"\n \"Fuck off.\"\n A little more...\n The branch makes a few disconcerting creaking noises, but I\u0027m going to pretend it\u0027s not giving out under my weight. I hold the camera up to my eye, the view through the lens making me slightly dizzy, and get a good focus on the ravine. The edges of either side of it creep up the corners of the frame.\n Jake\u0027s either holding his breath or wetting himself.\n Got it.\n I right myself, snake backward and hold the camera out. \"Catch!\"\n \"Parker, no--\"\n I let it go. It seems to fall in slow motion. Jake catches it like I knew he would and he starts swearing at me like I knew he would. When he\u0027s finished, he turns the camera on and checks out the shot.\n \"Decent,\" he mutters. \"But you\u0027re lucky I caught my camera.\"\n The branch I\u0027m on protests a little more. I stand very, very carefully and maneuver my way to a branch on the opposite side. It\u0027s tricky. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cracked-up-to-be/page-7.html","bookId":1897,"book":{"id":1897,"title":"Cracked Up To Be","description":"Storyline: \n When \"Perfect\" Parker Fadley starts drinking at school and failing her classes, all of St. Peter\u0027s High goes on alert.
