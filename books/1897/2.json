Do I make this easy on him or do I make it hard?\\n\\n A good person would make it easy.\\n\\n I decide to start with mocking and work my way up.\\n\\n \"Hey... hey, you--New Kid!\"\\n\\n He takes it well.\\n\\n \"Uh, yeah. Hi,\" he says. \"Maybe you could help me?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m late for class.\"\\n\\n \"That makes two of us.\" He smiles. \"Of course, you have an advantage in that you probably know where class is. Could you tell me where Mr. Norton\u0027s room is?\"\\n\\n \"Sorry, New Kid. Can\u0027t. I\u0027m late.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, come on. You have time--\"\\n\\n \"No. I have no time.\"\\n\\n Pause, pause, pause. We stare at each other for a good minute.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re just standing there,\" he finally splutters. \"How can you have time for that but not enough time to tell me how to get to Mr. Norton\u0027s room?\" I give him my most winning smile, shrug and resume the walk to my next class.\\n\\n Art.\\n\\n \"Are they all like you around here?\"\\n\\n I wave over my shoulder, but I don\u0027t stop.\\n\\n Norton says he\u0027s going to tell on me for being late. Henley and Grey will get the notice and I\u0027ll have to discuss it on Friday. Why were you late, Parker? What did you think that would accomplish, Parker? And then the tough question. What destructive behaviors were you engaging in for the five minutes you weren\u0027t in class, Parker?\\n\\n I\u0027m going to tell them I\u0027m on the rag.\\n\\n Anyway, I have two classes with Chris and this is one of them. We sit next to each other because his last name starts with E and mine starts with F. Ellory and Fadley, Winter Ball King and Queen three years running.\\n\\n I can\u0027t stand being around him, but I fake it pretty well.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re late,\" Chris says. We\u0027re working with charcoal today. He passes me a pencil and a sheet of paper. \"Where were you?\"\\n\\n \"If I told you, I\u0027d only disappoint you.\"\\n\\n \"Jesus, Parker.\"\\n\\n I start working on a charcoal blob. Abstract charcoal. Whatever. The black flakes off the pencil tip, making a nice mess of my fingers pretty quickly. Then I smudge until my masterpiece is ruined. I bet Norton will report that, too, like I didn\u0027t try, even though it\u0027s art, where no one should be able to tell if you\u0027re trying or not.\\n\\n The stupid thing is, I like art. I mean, it\u0027s okay.\\n\\n \"Oh, Jesus yourself and take a joke,\" I tell him. \"There\u0027s a new kid. He asked me directions. It took a couple minutes.\"\\n\\n \"Oh.\" He sounds relieved. \"Hey, your hair looks nice all brushed like that.\"\\n\\n \"Took you long enough to notice. It was brushed in homeroom.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got a date with Becky for Friday.\"\\n\\n \"Chris and Becky,\" I say thoughtfully. I try it again in Movie Announcer Voice: \"Chris and Becky. Presenting Chris and Becky...\"\\n\\n He stares. \"What?\"\\n\\n \"It doesn\u0027t sound right,\" I declare. \"There\u0027s no ring to it.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, well, you broke up with me.\"\\n\\n \"I know; I was there. And that has nothing to do with how stupid your names sound together.\" I try it again: \"Chris, Becky, Becky, Chris...\"\\n\\n He stares some more.\\n\\n \"Seriously, there\u0027s a new kid? You\u0027re not drunk?\"\\n\\n \"No, I\u0027m on the rag.\"\\n\\n Enter New Kid. The door swings open and he\u0027s flushed and out of breath like he ran all the way here. Everyone gets quiet--fresh meat--and Norton harrumphs.\\n\\n \"Better late than never. Gardner, I presume?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, sir,\" Gardner mumbles. \"I got lost.\"\\n\\n \"Late slip?\" Gardner looks like he can\u0027t believe it. \"I\u0027m new.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you for that, Gardner. Take a seat over there, help yourself to some charcoal and paper and get to work.\" Norton\u0027s such a hard-ass. He reminds me of George C. Scott sometimes. \"I expect you to be on time tomorrow.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not the guy you gave directions to, is it?\" Chris asks.\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t say I gave him directions; I said he asked me for them.\"\\n\\n \"Christ, Parker, you\u0027re a real bitch sometimes.\"\\n\\n Gardner skulks over to the table next to ours, sets up and starts drawing. I stare at him until he feels it and looks my way. His eyes widen and he points his charcoal pencil at me accusingly.\\n\\n \"You,\" he says. \"You\u0027re in this class?\"\\n\\n I smile. \"Hi. I\u0027m Parker Fadley.\"\\n\\n Chris reaches past me, extending his hand.\\n\\n \"Ignore her. I\u0027m Chris Ellory. Welcome to St. Peter\u0027s.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks,\" Gardner says, looking relieved that they\u0027re not all like me around here. He and Chris shake hands. \"Jake Gardner. Nice to meet you.\"\\n\\n Now that I\u0027ve heard his name, I\u0027m doomed to remember it. Just more useless information taking up brain space that could be better served for more important things like... stuff. Jake and Chris talk through art and discover they have so much in common it\u0027s amazing. Like, They Could Be Boyfriends If They Didn\u0027t Like Vaginas So Much Amazing.\\n\\n By the time the period is over, my charcoal blob has eaten all the white space but for one solitary speck to the lower left side of my paper. When Norton does his rounds, he leans over my shoulder and, in his best George C. Scott, says, \"I like it.\" Then he glances at Chris\u0027s halfhearted elm and goes, \"It\u0027s always trees with you! How many times do I have to tell you to think outside the tree, Ellory?\" And I laugh so hard I cry a little.\\n\\n Then the bell goes off again. The bell goes off too much.\\n\\n We eke our way out of the room and Chris turns to Jake and says, \"We\u0027re gonna check out the fast- food strip for lunch. Wanna come?\"\\n\\n \"Sure,\" Jake says.\\n\\n \"How about it, Parker?\" Chris asks me. Then he brings his hands to his mouth in mock horror. \"Oops, forgot. You\u0027re not allowed off grounds for lunch anymore! Oh, snap.\"\\n\\n I roll my eyes. \"That wasn\u0027t a snap.\"\\n\\n He says something else, but I don\u0027t hear it because I\u0027m gone. I drop my things at my locker and search out a spot in school that isn\u0027t around people, but there are none and that\u0027s when I notice that the halls are way too crowded.\\n\\n There are bodies everywhere.\\n\\n At first I do okay. I hover by the drinking fountain and try to look like I\u0027ve got somewhere to be. Then I start hearing this sound, like this sighing, no--not sighing. Breathing. Everyone breathing. I can hear the people around me sucking up all the fresh air, leaving nothing for me.\\n\\n My chest tightens and I can\u0027t breathe.\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t breathe.\"\\n\\n I scare the hell out of the school nurse. He darts up from his chair and makes a big fuss while I try to explain the problem.\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t breathe. The air in here is too stale... No, my chest feels fine. Yes, I can feel my left arm... Make them open some windows; they\u0027re using up all the air...\" He doesn\u0027t get it, but he directs me to a cot at the back of the room anyway. No one else is sick today, so I get a little peace and quiet. I lie on my back and scan the shelves across the room for a bottle of ipecac, but no such luck.\\n\\n I close my eyes.\\n\\n When I open them again, it\u0027s last period and I\u0027m in English and Becky is freaking out and flipping through her binder while Lerner looks on. I don\u0027t know what she\u0027s so worried about; she\u0027s golden. She never misses an essay and Lerner likes her. He\u0027s even saying, \"No worries, Halprin, just get it to me by the end of the week--\"\\n\\n \"But you don\u0027t understand, sir; I did the essay! I had it! It was here!\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure it will turn up,\" he tells her soothingly. \"Just make sure you hand it in by Friday...\"\\n\\n Becky looks like she\u0027s going to cry. Lerner moves on to me.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t even have to ask, do I, Fadley?\"\\n\\n Lerner likes me, too. Not as much as he used to. What I like best about Lerner is he\u0027s been teaching so long, he doesn\u0027t waste time. He readjusted his expectations of me immediately after the first time I got wasted and fell out of my chair in class.\\n\\n \"I think you should,\" I say, smiling. \"Go on, ask.\"\\n\\n His mustache twitches. \"Well, I\u0027m afraid to now.\"\\n\\n Becky\u0027s mouth drops open as I make a show out of taking the essay from my binder and handing it to Lerner. He stares at it, and then me, and for a second I wonder if he knows it\u0027s Becky\u0027s. But then he tucks it away with the other papers he\u0027s collected and it\u0027s good. Only I hope he doesn\u0027t do any expectation readjusting after this because then I\u0027ll have to disappoint him.\\n\\n Becky gapes at me, still teary eyed.\\n\\n \"When the fuck did you do that essay?\"\\n\\n \"History, lunch. I\u0027ll take my fifty dollars now, please.\"\\n\\n \"I was joking, Parker. The bet was a joke.\"\\n\\n But I won\u0027t let it be a joke, so when the last bell, finally, mercifully, rings, I chase after her down the hall, screaming her name.\\n\\n \"Becky! Hey, Becky! Becky Halprin!\"\\n\\n She pauses, stuck. At one end of the hall, her posse--my old posse--and at the other end, me. She thinks about it for a minute, sighs and heads in my direction.\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"What time\u0027s your date with Chris on Friday?\"\\n\\n She blushes.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s picking me up at six.\"\\n\\n \"Do you still have that pink sweater? The one that\u0027s supertight across the chest? You should wear that, he\u0027d like it.\" She looks all disgusted because she\u0027s too stupid to realize I\u0027m helping her out.\\n\\n \"Uh.\" She blinks. \"Okay. Thanks. I think.\"\\n\\n \"No problem.\" I pause. \"Hey, if you\u0027d won the bet, would it still have been a joke?\"\\n\\n \"Becky, come on,\" someone whines behind us. I glance down the hall. Sandra Morrison is tapping her foot impatiently and giving me a look of utter disdain, which is pretty amazing considering she wouldn\u0027t have dared to do it when I was the one leading her around by the nose. Becky sighs and briefly closes her eyes before reaching into her book bag, finding her wallet and pulling out a few crisp bills. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cracked-up-to-be/page-2.html","bookId":1897,"book":{"id":1897,"title":"Cracked Up To Be","description":"Storyline: When \"Perfect\" Parker Fadley starts drinking at school and failing her classes, all of St. Peter\u0027s High goes on alert.
