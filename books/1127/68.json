AS my health was far from satisfactory, I was able to do but little after my return from the Society Islands in August, 1893. I gave my farm some attention, and traveled occasionally among the people. In February, 1894, I received an invitation from James H. Love, manager for the concession of the \u002749 mining camp at the Midwinter Fair, in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco, to be present there. The invitation came to me through Israel Evans, of Lehi, Utah, who had been with me in California in 1848. I accepted, and in company with Israel Evans and my son James T. Brown, went to California in the month named. This visit to California extended about thirty days. We were treated with the greatest kindness. Our place of lodging at the miner\u0027s cabin on the fair grounds was comfortably fitted, and besides viewing the most excellent exhibits of this notable Midwinter Exposition, we also visited most of the places of interest in the locality. We were honored guests in every parade, and nothing more could be desired in the way of courtesies to make our stay pleasant. While in California on this occasion I wrote my pamphlet. \"Authentic History of the First Discovery of Gold in Sutter\u0027s Mill Race, California.\" This was the first accurate history of that event I had seen in print, all the other accounts having been gathered from hearsay and broken narratives, while I had the advantage of being an actual participant in the historic occurrence. In March, 1894, I returned home, and continued my ordinary labors, my health being considerably improved. At this time I began preparing my journal for publication, having to rewrite it to place it in presentable form, as much of it had been noted down under very adverse circumstances; it was also necessary to condense it greatly, many items of real interest being abbreviated to a considerable extent. I believe now that if I had realized at the outset what a great task it was, I should not have attempted it, notwithstanding the fact that I was fully aware that my life\u0027s experience had been filled with unusually interesting episodes. But I had not been accustomed to giving up a work once undertaken with a good aim; so I have continued to the present, and as I prepare this chapter, the earlier part of the work is in the hands of the printer. The only literary experience I have had previous to this work is writing a history of the first mission to the Pacific Islands and the subsequent progress of events in the Society Islands mission up to 1893, the manuscript of which history was filed with and is now a part of the records of the Church historian\u0027s office. In July, 1897, Utah\u0027s Semi-Centennial Jubilee was celebrated, the occasion being the fiftieth anniversary of the entrance of the Mormon Pioneers into the valley of the Great Salt Lake, July 24, 1847. The chief ceremonies were in Salt Lake City, July 20th to 25th, and I had the honor and pleasure of being present. I had not the privilege of being classed as one of the pioneers, for these were limited in the celebration to those who reached Utah in 1847, and I did not arrive there from the west till 1848. With the Mormon Battalion members, however, I was a Mormon pioneer, in the memorable journey across the country to the Pacific; I was also a pioneer in California, and later in Utah and surrounding places. The committee on the semi-centennial celebration, however, noted the fact that the members of the Mormon Battalion were entitled to recognition in connection with the Utah pioneer band, for the work of both was intimately associated. In pursuance of this, there was sent to me under date of July 19th, a letter containing this announcement: \"Survivors of the Mormon Battalion, the Nauvoo Legion, Captain Ballo\u0027s Band, and the Martial Band, are requested to meet at Pioneer Square on Tuesday next, July 20th, at 9 o\u0027clock a.m., sharp, for the purpose of marching in advance of the original band of Pioneers to witness the unveiling ceremonies upon that occasion. Those who are able to walk are earnestly requested to do so, but those who are too feeble to walk will join them at the Monument. \"Hoping to see you with us at the appointed time, I am, \"Yours respectfully, \"H. F. MCGARVIE, \"Assistant Director-General.\" I responded to this limited notice, in common with other members of the Mormon Battalion at hand. But the summary treatment was in such strong contrast to the consideration and courtesy extended at the Midwinter Fair, and subsequently at the California Golden Jubilee, that its effect was to enhance greatly, in the minds\u0027 of those who participated in the California and the Utah celebrations, the admiration for the California managers in their broad and thorough comprehension of the amenities of such historic public events. But I must add here that the Mormon Battalion members, whose journey west was over another route than that followed by the companies which came direct to the Salt Lake Valley, were fitly honored in the hearts of Utah\u0027s people as of the pioneer band in the great west. December 1, 1897, I received the following; \"1216 HYDE STREET, SAN FRANCISCO, \"November 29, 1897. \"Mr. James S. Brown: \"DEAR SIR: The celebration committee of the Society of California Pioneers, expect, though as yet no formal action has been taken, to invite yourself, Mr. J. Johnston, Mr. Azariah Smith, and Mr. Henry W. Bigler, who were with Marshall at Coloma on the 24th of January, 1848, to come to San Francisco as honored guests of the Society, and at its expense, to participate in the semi-centennial celebration of that eventful day, on the 24th of January next. \"If we should send such an invitation to you, will you come and be with us? Letters from Mr. Bigler and Mr. Smith lead me to hope that they will accept the invitation. \"So soon as formal action is taken, you will be informed either by myself or by the secretary of our committee. \"Yours truly, \"JOHN S. HITTELL. \"A member of the Celebration Committee.\" My response was that if my health would permit, and all things were satisfactory, I should be pleased to accept such an invitation. I received another letter from Mr. Hittell, under date of December 15th, in which he said: \"Mr. James S. Brown: \"DEAR SIR: This evening the celebration committee of the Pioneer Society adopted a resolution to invite you to attend the Golden Jubilee of California, as an honored guest of the Society, which will provide you with first class transportation from and to your home, and take charge of your hotel bill from the 22nd of January till the 31st of January, 1898, in this city. \"Mr. B. H. and Mr. H. B. Luther, brothers, say that they were at Coloma on the 24th of January, 1848, as boys, with their father and mother. Do you know them and remember when they reached Coloma? They say their mother, who was with them there, is still living.\" Under date of December 25th, Mr. Hittell also wrote me: \"Captain James S. Brown: \"DEAR SIR: Please let me know the amount of the railroad fare from Salt Lake to Ogden, so that we may forward the sum to you by letter; we expect to send you a ticket from Ogden to this city, including a lower berth in a sleeping car. \"We hope that you, Bigler, Smith and Johnston will all come in the same car. I have addressed a similar letter to each of the other three. \"Thanks for your letter of December 20th. I was satisfied that Gregson and the Luthers were not at the sawmill on the 24th of January, 1848. \"I suppose the best train would be the one leaving Salt Lake City at 9:10 p.m., on January 20th, arriving at San Francisco January 22nd, at 9:45 a.m. Does that suit you?\" The next communication on the subject was as follows: \"EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT, THE SOCIETY OF CALIFORNIA PIONEERS, NO. 5, PIONEER PLACE, SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA, \"January 7, 1898, \"James S. Brown, Esq., Salt Lake City: \"DEAR SIR: The Society of California Pioneers invites you to attend the Golden Jubilee Celebration of our State, and to accept the hospitality of the Society in San Francisco, from the 22nd till the 31st of January, 1898. Enclosed find a pass from the S. P. R. R. Co., for your passage from Ogden to San Francisco and return. We send you today by Wells, Fargo \u0026 Co.\u0027s Express, fifteen dollars in coin to pay for your sleeping berth and meals on the way. We have engaged a lower berth for you on the Pullman car which leaves Ogden on the night of Thursday, the 20th instant. \"The reception committee will meet you on the Oakland boat on the morning of Saturday, the 22nd, and will wear the badge of the Society. Should you miss seeing them you will go to the Russ House, where we have engaged rooms and board for you. \"Should you not be able to come, please return the enclosed railroad pass, and notify the ticket agent at Ogden that you will not use the sleeping berth. \"Yours truly, \"J. I. SPEAR, Secretary. \"P. S.—We have arranged to have your railroad pass extended for thirty days if you wish it. S.\" Like my Mormon Battalion companions who were with me on the memorable 24th of January, 1848, I could not but feel highly gratified at the courtesy extended, and look forward with pleasure to the commemoration, under so favorable circumstances and with such marvelous progress as California had made in civilization, of the fiftieth anniversary of a notable event, which at the time of its occurrence, came to us in the midst of hardships, fatigue and almost exile from home and relatives, yet was a world-wonder in the results which followed the announcement to the world of California\u0027s great gold discovery.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1757/51387.html","bookId":1127,"book":{"id":1127,"title":"Life of a Pioneer","description":"简介： THE life of a pioneer in Western America always is full of peril and hardship; often it has a large share of startling episodes and thrilling adventures; not infrequently it is associated with notable historic events; and the experiences met with dev...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1757","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:25 AM"}}
