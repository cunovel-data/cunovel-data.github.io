IN response to the invitation from the Society of California Pioneers, I left Salt Lake City on January 20, 1898, in company with Henry W. Bigler, Azariah Smith and Wm. J. Johnston, who, like myself, were guests of the Society. We reached Oakland, California, January 22, and were met by Mr. John H. Jewett, president of the society, and a committee consisting of Messrs. John S. Hittell, Almarin B. Paul, General Wm. H. Pratt, and Misses Anna P. Green and Mary M. Green. The ladies pinned badges of the Society of California Pioneers on the lapels of our coats. We were received with the greatest cordiality, and were taken to the Russ House, San Francisco, where we were comfortably lodged, being shown special consideration by the proprietor and his amiable wife, and from that time on we were given the best of attention. Nothing that could be done was too good for us, and language fails to express our high appreciation of the courtesy and kindness bestowed. Whenever we attended any of the functions of California\u0027s Golden Jubilee Celebration, or desired to visit a place, carriages were at our service. January 24th was the fiftieth anniversary of the discovery of gold at Sutter\u0027s mill race, and there was a magnificent pageant in celebration of the event. We occupied the post of distinction in the procession, our carriage bearing the legend, \"Companions of Marshall.\" We were the only survivors of that notable occasion, fifty years before. The place of honor was also accorded to us at the celebration ceremonies in the evening at Wood\u0027s Pavilion, and on the 27th we were at a reception in Pioneer Hall, and greeted the multitudes, old and young, anxious to see and shake hands with us; and at the Mining Fair our treatment was characterized by the same cordial and distinguished welcome. The celebration ceremonies lasted the entire week. When at our hotel we were besieged by reporters, and hundreds of people called to see us, and get our autographs. Our photographs also were taken for the Society of Pioneers. Outside of the celebration proper, there was the same magnanimous kindness. I could not name all the citizens who extended to us marked courtesies, but feel that I must specially mention Captain John T. McKenzie of the steamer San Rafael, who was very attentive, also Hon. Irving Scott, manager of the great union Iron Works, at which place we had a particularly interesting visit and entertainment. Two of my companions started home on January 31st, and the third on February 2nd. I stayed a few days longer, visiting my brother at Petaluma. I also went to many other places of interest, then returned home, all expenses of my journey being provided. A few days later I received the following: \"EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT, THE SOCIETY OF CALIFORNIA PIONEERS, NO. 5, PIONEER PLACE, SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA, \"February 9, 1898, \"James S. Brown, Esq., Salt Lake City, Utah: \"DEAR SIR: I have the honor of advising you that at the monthly meeting of the members of the Society held at Pioneer Hall on Monday, February 7, 1898, the following resolutions were unanimously adopted: \"Whereas, The Golden Jubilee just passed marks the second grand event as connected with the first discovery of gold in California, and as all pioneers feel gratified at the universal desire of the people to pay tribute to the pioneer days, now be it \"Resolved, That the Society of California Pioneers tenders its thanks to the press generally; to the state and city officials; to the military as a body; to the various mining associations; to the Native Daughters and Native Sons of the Golden West, and to the many other organizations that participated in making the grand pageant of January 24th a splendid success. And be it further \"Resolved, That the thanks of this society are also tendered to Henry W. Bigler, James S. Brown, Wm. J. Johnston and Azariah Smith, the companions of Marshall, in lending their presence for the Jubilee; and especially do we appreciate the efforts and labors of the executive committee of the Golden Jubilee, and we also return thanks to the Southern Pacific Company for complimentary passes to the four companions of Marshall to and from San Francisco and Ogden, also for its liberal contribution to the Golden Jubilee held under auspices of the society; and also to Irving M. Scott on part of the union Iron Works, for the invitation to the companions of Marshall and members of this Society to visit the works, and the placing at our disposal their tug for the trip, and further for the many courtesies extended to all by the several officers connected with the works while there. \"J. H. JEWETT, President.\" On February 20th this note came: \"1316 HYDE STREET, SAN FRANCISCO, \"February 18, 1898. \"Mr. James S. Brown: \"Dear Sir: Your letter of the 16th inst, with the news that you had arrived safely at home, has given me pleasure. I felt some responsibility for my part in bringing four old men so far away from home, but now that I know all have arrived in good health at Salt Lake, I congratulate myself that events have turned out so favorably. I have had no letter from Mr. Bigler or Mr. Smith, but they will write to me. \"I spoke promptly to Mr. Spear, the secretary, about sending fifteen dollars to pay for the expenses of your return trip, and I understood him to promise that the money would be transmitted to you by check. \"The Pioneer Society will long preserve a pleasant recollection of the participation of the four companions of Marshall in our Jubilee celebration, and personally I shall always be glad to hear of their welfare. \"Yours truly, \"JOHN S. HITTELL.\" Here is the closing communication in relation to my latest visit to California and the occasion which caused it: \"San Francisco, March 9, 1898. \"Mr. James S. Brown, Salt Lake City: \"DEAR SIR: Enclosed please find a copy of the report of the reception committee of the Golden Jubilee: \"To John H. Jewett, President of the California Pioneers: \"The reception committee appointed by the Society to receive its guests attending the celebration of the Golden Jubilee on the 24th of January last, begs leave to report that its task has been completed. \"On the morning of January 22nd all the members of the committee received and welcomed the four companions of Marshall on the overland train at Oakland, and escorted them to the Russ House, where, under the direction of President John H. Jewett, they were provided with comfortable accommodations. \"These four men, the only survivors of those who were with Marshall at Coloma when he discovered gold there on Monday, the 24th of January, 1848, are: \"I. Henry W. Bigler, born in Harrison County, West Virginia, August 28th, 1815, who in his diary made the only written record of the gold discovery on the day of its occurrence. He is now a resident of St. George, Utah. \"2. Azariah Smith, born at Boylston, New York, on the 1st of August, 1828, who, on the first Sunday after the discovery, wrote in his diary that gold had been found in the preceding week. \"3. James S. Brown, born in Davison County, North Carolina, on the 4th of July, 1828, who recollects that on the evening of January 24th, 1848, H. W. Bigler said he would write in his diary that something like gold had been discovered, as it might be important some day. He resides in Salt Lake City. \"4. Wm. J. Johnston, born near New Baltimore, Ohio, on the 21st of August, 1824, and now resides in Ramah, New Mexico. \"These four men are all clear in mind, and for their years, strong and active in body. \"In the procession on the 24th they occupied a carriage marked \u0027Companions of Marshall.\u0027 On the evening of that day, they were entertained in our hall with special honor, and two days later they held a reception in the same place. Various members of our Society, and especially Captain McKenzie, showed them much attention. They were guests of honor at the Mining Fair on the opening evening. Hon. Irving M. Scott, manager of the union Iron Works, gave them a special entertainment at his shipyard; and other citizens contributed to make their stay in our city pleasant. The whole Jubilee week was a round of festivity for them. \"Messrs. Bigler and Smith were escorted to their returning train at Oakland on the 31st of January. Mr. Johnston two days later, and Mr. Brown in the next succeeding week. They all reached their homes safely, and all have written to members of the committee acknowledging the attention and honor shown to them by the Society of California Pioneers. \"As they are the only persons now living who saw gold in the days of its discovery, their attendance at our semi-centennial celebration connected our Jubilee in a highly interesting manner with the great event which it commemorated. We may add that personal acquaintance with these venerable men has been a source of pleasure to all members of this committee, as well as to many other Pioneers. \"Respectfully submitted, \"JOHN S. HITTELL, Chairman. \"ALMARIN B. PAUL, \"W. H. PRATT.\" Upon my return home, I again gave attention to this autobiography, which proved no light task, as my health has been far from good. On the 14th of December, 1899, a keen sorrow came to myself and family. My son Homer, in his twenty-sixth year, died on that date, as a result of injuries received at a cave-in at the Silver King mine, Park City, Utah, three weeks before. When war broke out between Spain and the United States in 1898, he enlisted in response to President McKinley\u0027s call for volunteers, and became a member of Troop C, Utah Volunteer Cavalry. After his return from California, where the cavalry was sent, he was married, the event occurring two months before the accident which cost him his life. On December 19, he was buried in Salt Lake City, the funeral services being held at the Seventeenth Ward assembly rooms. In the summer of 1898, I was added to the list of Utah\u0027s Old Folks, attending the excursion to Lagoon, Davis County, in July, 1898, to Geneva, Utah County, in July, 1899, and again at Lagoon on July 6, 1900. The Old Folks include all people over seventy years of age, independent of creed, race or color; these are accorded receptions, excursions, and similar happy courtesies, as marks of honor and respect to the aged. The central committee having this highly appreciated undertaking in charge has for its chairman the Presiding Bishop of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. By the close of 1899, I had completed the preparation of my life\u0027s history for publication in a neat volume, and soon thereafter arranged for the printing, which at this date, July, 1900, is accomplished. Now that I have reached the seventy-second annual milestone of my life, I realize that the period for especially notable or thrilling events in my mortal career is past; and in the publication of my autobiography, I sincerely trust that this humble final extended labor on my part will achieve the principle aim of its performance, that of doing good to those who live after me, in the witness its record bears of the mercy, power, and goodness of God, and the latter-day progress of His great and loving design for the blessing and salvation of His children. With this attainment, the influence of the record, LIFE OF A PIONEER, will be in accord with the sincere desire and earnest effort of my soul throughout life.
