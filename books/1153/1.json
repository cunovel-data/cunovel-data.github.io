{"id":13270,"no":1,"title":"PREFACE.","content":"To my mind there is no more picturesque period in the history of Western Europe than that of the Renaissance. Among the many aspects in which it is possible to regard this important epoch, that of its influence on chivalry is one of the most interesting. The rough simplicity of the proud medi?val knight, gradually yielding to the subtle spell of pure poesy and courtly love, while the barred helm and steel gauntlet were hardly doffed from the stern field, or gorgeous tourney, this is a subject which will always fascinate. However practical the world may grow, and perhaps, because of its very practicality, there will always be minds which will turn with relief to the romantic and the ideal. In the turmoil of real life, with its sordid materialism, there are many men and women who dwell with delight on some noble life clothed round with the glamour of ancient time, and presenting itself to the mind in the garb of gorgeous pomp and splendid pageantry, who, while trying to achieve some great emprise themselves, will dream of the men of old time, who have soared aloft on the pinions of glorious fame. With the privilege of a writer of fiction, I have chosen Sir Edward Woodville,[*] commonly called Lord Woodville, as the \"eidolon\" on which to clothe the heroic virtue of chivalry, without its many and grosser faults. So little is known of the Captain of the Wight, but what little there is, shows him in so noble a light, that I feel I am not necessarily exaggerating, may even be accurately describing, his knightly character. His attachment to his own unfortunate family, and his murdered nephews, caused him to be included among the list of nobles and knights, who were held up to public execration in that long and artful manifesto put forth by Richard III., before he set out for the campaign which ended in Bosworth field. [*] I have adopted the spelling of the name Woodville, authorised by Lord Bacon. The varieties--Wydevil, Wydeville, Wyddevil, etc, etc.--are as numerous as those of Leicester, who wrote his own name eight different ways; while Villiers varied his fourteen times. But Mainwaring has outdone them all. It is said there are one hundred and thirty-one varieties! Returning in the victorious train of Henry Tudor, now Henry VII. of England, Sir Edward Woodville was invested with the honourable post which had been lately held by his unfortunate brother, the accomplished Lord Scales. As \"Lord and Captain of the Isle of Wight,\" he seems to have made himself so popular that, by his own influence alone, he was able to induce four hundred of the inhabitants to follow him to Brittany. \"Noble and courageous,\" \"hardie and valyant,\" \"a valiant gentleman, and desirous of honour,\" are the epithets with which the old chroniclers speak of Sir Edward Woodville. That he was never married, and died upon the field of battle \"valiantly fighting,\" are all the facts that are known about him. But these facts are enough to allow me to interpret his life as I have done. Like another more exalted, but less fortunate, inhabitant of Carisbrooke Castle, in the last sad act of his life, \"He nothing common did or mean Upon that memorable scene,\" but with his \"crew of talle and hardie\" men of the Wight, died fighting with his sword in hand, and his face to the foe, as became a valiant captain of that lovely isle. I have consulted all the authorities I could find, in order to give as accurate a picture of the time as possible. I don\u0027t know that it is needful to mention all, but the \"Tournois du Roi René d\u0027Anjou,\" \"The Memoirs of St Palaye,\" \"The Boke of St Albans,\" Sir Thomas Malory\u0027s \"Mort d\u0027Arthur,\" and \"La joyeuse hystoire du bon Chevalier, le gentil Seigneur de Bayart,\" have been my chief sources for knightly feats and the accessories of chivalry; while the chroniclers Halle, Grafton, Fabyan, Stowe, Philip de Commines, Bouchet, and the Paston Letters, have been my chief historical guides. Lord Bacon has surveyed the whole period from a loftier standpoint, and in his \"Reigne of Henry VIIth,\" has presented us with a stately specimen of the art of writing history; although, as an old manuscript note in my edition briefly puts it, \"it is somewhat more of a picture of a polished prince than a history exactly true, more vouchers and fewer speeches would have given it more strength, though less beauty.\" It must be a subject of interest to the inhabitants of the Isle of Wight to know that, in writing of that fatal expedition to Brittany, every one of the old historians speak of the bravery of the predecessors, and, in many cases, the ancestors, of the present dwellers in the island. It is to be deplored that there is no original account of the expedition of the four hundred, such as exists in the \"Herald\u0027s\" account of the expedition to Dixmude, preserved in John Leland\u0027s Collectanea, which happened in the same year (1488). I have tried laboriously to find out the names of the chief inhabitants of the Isle of Wight at that time; but owing to the great danger and discomfort there was in living in the island during the 15th century, arising from the constantly threatened invasions of the French, and their many actual occupations of the island, the chief families appear either to have become extinct in that period, or to have retired to the mainland. It is also worthy of note, to see how many times the chief manors passed into new families through the female line. This fact is very significant of the troubled state of the times. It was not that the manhood of the island ceased for want of sons, but that these sons met a violent death in the many wars of that age. In conclusion, I may add that, while the story is mainly written for the young, with which object in view I have paid less attention to the delineation of character than the animation of incident, and the variety of the scene, I trust their elders may also find information about a romantic episode in our local and national history.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1700/50046.html","bookId":1153,"book":{"id":1153,"title":"The Captain of the Wight","description":"简介： Among the many aspects in which it is possible to regard this important epoch, that of its influence on chivalry is one of the most interesting.
