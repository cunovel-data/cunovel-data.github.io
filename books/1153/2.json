{"id":13271,"no":2,"title":"CHAPTER I. HOW THE GERFALCON SPED.","content":"In front of an old ivy-covered manor house, so built, with its projecting wings, as to form three sides of a quadrangle, a boy was standing, idly leaning his arms on the stone coping of the low wall which shut in the fourth side of the courtyard. The boy was well grown, with fair, ruddy face, and brown hair, cut, after the picturesque fashion of the latter half of the fifteenth century, straight above his eyebrows, but falling in wavy masses on each side of his face. His eyes were bright, and full of life. His strongly-knit frame gave promise of strength and activity, and his age might well have been put at seventeen or eighteen even, so tall was he, and well grown, although, in truth, he was not more than fifteen. The free life in the fresh Hampshire air, blowing from the sea, over forest, gorse-covered common, and well-tilled fields, had given play to his thews and sinews. It was evening. The sun was just setting over the blue hills covered with woods, interspersed with heathy patches. Far as the eye could see, there were gently-swelling undulations, with a loftier hill looming out of the grey mist which rose, film-like, behind the nearer masses of the russet forest. Here and there some larger expanse of mist looked like a lake amid the overhanging trees, while over all brooded the silence of the evening, when all nature pauses in reverence to the setting sun, broken only by the lowing of some distant kine, or the faint hum of a beetle as it went booming by. Suddenly the boy stood up, listened attentively, then, springing through the gateway, he darted down the road in front of the house, to meet a horseman who was riding up the forest glade. The man was singing blithely as he rode, and the refrain of each verse rang merrily in the stillness of the evening. It was the sound of this which had told the boy of the new comer\u0027s approach. \"Ringwood, my hound, with a merry taste, All about the green wood began caste, I took my horn and blew him a blast With tro-ro-ro-ro! tro-ro-ro-ro! With hey go bet! hey go bet! ho! There he goeth, there he goeth, there he goe, We shall have sport and game enowe,\" rang out clear over the wood, and cheerily the boy answered,-- \"In sooth, Humphrey, thou\u0027rt in fine voice to-night; but, prythee, cease thy song for a while, and give me the gerfalcon, that I may see her.\" \"Certes, Master Ralph, thou wilt be well pleased anon. \u0027Tis the veriest sweetest little bird for mounting a heron, or springing a pheasant, as ever I did see. There, stroke her cautiously; see how she manteleth and warbelleth her wings.\" So saying, the serving man, or varlet, as the falconer\u0027s assistants were called, stooped down and held out his right hand, which was protected by a stout leathern glove with a large gauntlet. Two leather thongs, called lunes, were connected by two rings or tyrrits, and the lunes were then fastened to the jesses, and the ends loosely twined round the little finger, to prevent the bird from escaping. The bird was gaily hooded, and turned its head from side to side, causing the little artificial plume of feathers on its head to shake and flutter gaily. The boy, in his eagerness to stroke his new possession--for it was his birthday, and his father had sent to Salisbury to buy this hawk for his favourite son--put out his hand too quickly, for the hawk made a peck at it; but he drew it back in time, and with more caution and gentle words he at last succeeded in stroking her wings and back. \"Marry Humphrey, she is a fine one. She is a long hawk, and ought to fly well.\" \"I\u0027 faith! will she so. I got her rare cheap; for the price has risen mightily sithen the tolls have been laid on all hawks. \u0027Tis one shilling and eightpence, over and above the price of the bird, I had to pay to Brother Anselm for the licence of bringing her over; but I got her cheap, marry, did I! An you\u0027ll find such another in all the south of England--ay, and the north too--for ten shillings, never call me Humphrey more.\" They had now reached the gateway where Master Ralph, as Humphrey called him, had been waiting for his birthday present. The groom took off the leather glove and gave it to Ralph, who put it on, and took the bird into the house to show to his father and mother, while Humphrey rode round to the stables. The interior of the hall was a large low oak-panelled room, with a wide fireplace on one side. Antlers, spears, bows, and bills were hung or fixed all along the walls, and a few skins of red deer and other wild animals lay about on the stone floor. Ralph crossed the hall, and went down a low dark passage. He paused at a little oak door, and tapped. \"Come in,\" said a lady\u0027s voice, and Ralph entered joyously. \"Oh, mother, look! She\u0027s a hawk fit for the emperor. Thank thee, father, thank thee; \u0027tis the best gift thou couldst have chosen!\" And the boy went up to the large armchair, in which an old man was sitting, clad in a long robe of fur, while opposite to him was standing his wife, the Dame Isabel de Lisle. \"Ay, my son, so thou art right joyous, art thou? Well, and that\u0027s e\u0027en as it should be. Thou art growing a stout lad, and \u0027tis time to be thinking of thy after life. I would fain have ye all started in the world, before God sees fit to call me to him; and methinks \u0027twill not be long now.\" \"Why, father, what ails thee, that thou talkest thus dolefully?\" said Ralph, his ardour damped by the tone of his father\u0027s remarks. \"Nay, child,\" said his mother, stroking the glossy, waving hair of her son, who had doffed his cap the moment he entered his parents\u0027 presence, \"nay, child, \u0027tis naught but the old wound thy father hath gotten at Barnet grieveth him to-night.\" \"May-be, may-be, fair wife,\" said the old knight, who always called his lady \"fair,\" although she was certainly considerably past the age when any claims to fairness might reasonably be supposed to have been surrendered; but in his eyes she was always fair. \"Perchance \u0027tis naught; but my mind misgiveth me, and I would fain talk gravely to my sons to-night. If God wills that I should live, well and good--if not, well and good too; leastways, I shall have settled matters aright before I go hence.\" \"But, father, thou hast not looked at my falcon that thou gavest me. See what a long hawk it is; and what a gay lune Brother Anselm hath put on it.\" \"Ay, marry, fair son, \u0027tis a fine bird, and will spring a partridge rarely, I\u0027ll venture. Thou must fly her to-morrow--there\u0027s many a gagylling of geese, or sord of mallards, down Chute Forest way.\" \"Certes, father, I\u0027ll e\u0027en try her at a heron first.\" At this moment another step was heard outside, and two other boys came in; one a good deal older, and the other a year younger than Ralph. \"Well, Ralph, what hast got there?\" said the elder, coming up and looking at the bird. \"Marry she\u0027s a fine hawk, but I\u0027d rather have had a falcon gentil.\" \"Ay, ay, and pay twenty shillings for it, let alone the toll of forty shillings in bringing of her into the kingdom.\" \"Nay, thou mightest have gotten one cheap from old Simon Bridle. He knows where all the best birds are to be got--all through the country side--\" \"Nay, Jasper, why dost try to put the lad out of countenance with his pretty bird? Thou knowest she is a good bird, and thou wouldst be glad enough to have her thyself,\" said his mother. \"Now leave we this talk of the gerfalcon, and sithen you are all here, and \u0027tis yet half an hour to supper, let me hear what you, my sons, would wish to do after I am dead and gone. Jasper, you are the eldest, to you will fall my Bailiwick of Chute Forest, my manors of Chute, Holt, and Thruxton, and many other fair lands. Now wouldst thou go to the court, and seek to increase thy estate, as did thy great-grandfather Sir John Lisle of blessed memory, or wouldst thou stay at home, and take place and rank in thine own county?\" The eldest son took little time to answer, but replied respectfully,-- \"I would fain stay at home and care for you and my lady mother, and mind the fair lands God and my ancestors have left me.\" \"Then, my son, as God wills it, and you have chosen, so be it, and may God\u0027s blessing and thy parents\u0027 be upon thee. Now, Ralph, my son, what willest thou?\" The young boy hesitated. He looked at his mother, and then down, and finally, raising his eyes with a keen light of joyous but rather shy determination said,-- \"Noble sire, I would fain go to learn arms, and be trained in some noble prince\u0027s household, for I am of an age now when I could do some deed which might earn me knighthood.\" \"Well, fair son, thou hast answered as I would have thee. \u0027Tis sad to thy lady mother and me to part with thee, even for a space, but it is thy life that must be spent, not ours, and we have ever thought on thy weal. I will take thought what can be determined to try purveyance and maintenance as befitteth a son of the De Lisles. And now, son Walter, what willest thou?\" Walter was a delicate, slight boy, with a studious face, and one who had always been looked upon as the scholar of the family. He knew well what his parents wished, and also what was the custom of those of gentle blood who were the youngest sons. They must either seek their fortune in war, or else in the Church. He had not physical strength, nor sufficiently combative instincts, for the profession of arms, although, boylike, he had often been led away, when reading the romances of the time, to wish to imitate the deeds of Roland, or Tristram, or Launcelot; but then he was very fond of their worthy chaplain, who was also the boys\u0027 tutor, and he had been strongly imbued with a desire to sacrifice himself to God, as it was called. He therefore answered,-- \"Father, I would like much to be a clerk, and follow in the steps of Our Lord and Master. Perchance I may do some good work some day.\" \"Ay, in sooth wilt thou, my dear son; and thou hast made the choice most after thy mother\u0027s heart, albeit, weak man that I am, had I been a youth, I would have thought scorn of a clerkly life, yet, now I am old, I know well what awaiteth those who have devoted themselves to God and Mother Church from their youth upward. I will avise me what hath best be done for thee also, and will send a missive to my right reverend kinsman the Abbot of Quarr, and perchance he will do his best to help us. And now, my sons, since all is in fair trim for your future welfare, and thy noble and fair mother is right pleased, I know, as truly am I--and I give God thanks that He hath given me such right trusty and well-nurtured sons--let us all go to supper, for we have even to drink the health of our Ralph, who by God\u0027s will from henceforth will soon become a right honest varlet and trusty page, and in time will proceed to be a very worshipful knight, like his ancestors have been--worthy men, and leal to their liege lord.\" So saying, the old knight rose up with difficulty, assisted by his sons, who ran to aid him, for he had received a severe wound from a bill, over his left thigh, and had never recovered the use of it since. \"Grammercy, fair sons! but, Ralph, do thou lead in thy lady mother, for to thee belongs the honour of the day.\" And so the little party went down the passage and entered the hall, where supper was laid at the upper end. The servants were all assembled in the body of the hall, and the sons carved for their parents at the high table. Ralph\u0027s health was duly drunk amid much festivity, and the whole household retired to rest at a reasonable hour. The next day a messenger was despatched to Salisbury, where the Abbot of Quarr, who was related to Sir John Lisle, or De Lysle, was staying, to ask him to come over to Thruxton Hall, and advise his kinsman on the future of his sons. The worthy Abbot came without delay; and that evening a family consultation was held in the old parlour, round the knight\u0027s armchair. The old knight briefly explained the matter, and then left the worthy Abbot to comment on it. \"By the Holy Rood! but thy gentle sons have all well bethought them, and I could not have directed them better myself. Truly, \u0027tis the overruling spirit of God who has guided them to a right judgment!\" said the Abbot. \"Now for Jasper there will need to be no thought taken. Out of the abundance of thy lands he will be provided for, and may marry and raise up a fair lineage; but for our nephew Ralph other thoughts will be requisite. He will need fair clothes, as becometh one of a noble house, and an honest varlet to go with him, and a mettlesome courser; one not too fiery, that will lead him astray, and perchance disgrace him, or his clothes, but one that is stout withal, and not of a too tame spirit. And now methinks I know of just such a one, which the Prior of Christchurch, who is at Sarum now on business, wisheth to part with, having become too feeble or too stout for so mettlesome a nag. Nephew Ralph, I will e\u0027en give him thee, with my blessing.\" \"My Lord Abbot, I give thee humble thanks,\" stammered Ralph delighted. \"And now we must bethink us to what noble lord we may apprentice him. Thou knowest what state my Lord Scales, lately deceased, kept in his Castle of Carisbrooke. He, poor man--and may the Lord have mercy on his soul--was grievously done to death near Stoney Stratford, by the late King Richard, whom the devil led far astray. Nevertheless, he was a man of war, and well skilled in subtle council. However, King Henry hath made his brother Captain-General of our land; and Sir Edward Woodville, whom most men call the Lord Woodville, and who some even think will be called to the council by the style of Lord Rivers, is but now on his way back from the hard fight at Stoke by Newark, where he hath gained himself fresh glory. Certes he is a gallant, very puissant, and right hardy lord, and one under whom much knighthood and gentleness might be learnt, and as he is the uncle of our sovereign lord the King\u0027s most noble wife, there is much hope Ralph might be advanced in the King\u0027s household. Now I can present our fair nephew to him, and he can be brought up under my eye in the right pleasant Castle of Carisbrooke, of the honour of which the Lisles hold the Manor of Mansbridge. How say you, kinsman mine, will this serve you?\" \"Ay, marry will it, my Lord Abbot, and I see fair promise of the boy\u0027s doing well, and faring right puissantly. And now I bethink me, our kinsman of Briddlesford may take an interest in the lad. His own son, I hear, hath been disinherited by him for his wilfulness and strong fealty to the house of York. I would fain see them reconciled, but an that may not be, I see no wrong in Ralph marrying his only daughter. But now, canst thou do somewhat also for son Walter here?--he would like well to be a clerk.\" \"By Our Lady, but he is a good lad, and we will take order that he be well advanced, as far as our poor influence in the Holy Church goeth; but he should be entered at Oxen ford shortly, for he is of age to go thither. I will write to my well-beloved brother and kinsman, the Abbot of Abyngdon, who will get him entered at Queen\u0027s College, over which, when I was a scholar, the very puissant prince Cardinal Beaufort was provost.\" Thus the future of the boy was well arranged, and it was agreed that the Abbot of Quarr should take Ralph with him, as soon as his outfit was ready; and in order to expedite matters, a serving-man was sent to Salisbury to fetch out a tailor with the necessary cloth and stuff suitable to apparel a young man of good birth who was going to be page to so potent a lord as the Lord Woodville. At the same time, the varlet received orders to negotiate with the Prior of Christchurch for the horse. Meanwhile Ralph and his brother had tried the qualities of his new hawk. \"Thou well knowest, brother Ralph,\" said Jasper to him, as they rode along on their small ponies towards Chute Forest, \"my peregrine will fly faster than thy gerfalcon.\" \"Marry, will it? that we shall see, I trow. See there\u0027s a bird yonder; \u0027tis a heron, now fly our birds at her.\" No sooner said than done; off went the jesses, away went the hoods, and with a swing of the arm and wrist, the noble birds were cast off the fist. Up they sprang high in air. The gerfalcon mounted quicker, but the peregrine went straighter. Away they sped and the boys after them, halloing to the dogs to keep to heel. \"See, Ralph, I told thee so, thy bird can\u0027t hold a candle to mine. Well flown, Swiftwing, well mounted! Now she sees the quarry!\" \"Ay, and the quarry sees her. Look, Jasp, she has turned, and, by St Edmund, she\u0027ll cross my beauty! Listen to the sweet tinkle of her bells. How swift she mounteth. Ah! my little lady, thou knowest thy work well.\" \"I\u0027ll bet you my new riding-whip against your new set of bells, that my hawk strikes her first.\" \"Done!\" cried Ralph eagerly. The attention of the two boys was keenly fixed on the two birds, and they rode on, heeding nothing, the varlet who attended his young lords keeping well up with them. \"Hi! Master Jasper, look where thou goest,\" cried out the servant; \"thou will ride down yon old man!\" Jasper was not best pleased at being interrupted in his view of the sport, and, glancing down, saw a man with a hood drawn over his head, and an old tattered gown on, who was with difficulty walking across the heath, attended by a young girl, meanly attired, but very modest and sweet-looking. \"Why, old man, wherefore crossedst thou my path? Didst not see the game toward? Fie, I should have thought an old man like you wouldst have known better!\" \"Nay, fair gentleman, I did cross thy path purposely. I have lost my way, and am parlous footsore; so is this poor lass, my daughter; and I crave you of your kindness tell me where we may get shelter.\" \"Ay, that will my father right willingly give you. Go you on, keep the path over the common, and we shall follow you anon. Thou canst not miss thy way. Say young Master Jasper of Thruxton sent thee. Thou wilt meet with care enough there.\" \"Grammercy, fair young master; but I will not keep thee from thy sport to waste thy time hearing a poor man\u0027s thanks.\" So saying, the man and the young girl continued their way. Ralph had been looking on; he saw how weary the man was, and his generous young heart beat with pity. He rode after the strangers, and, dismounting, insisted on the poor man getting up and taking his daughter on the croup behind him. There was something in the manner of the wanderers which seemed to tell him they were not common people. The man was evidently much touched. He thanked the boy with quiet dignity, and accepted his offer with ready pleasure; while the large hazel eyes of the girl filled with grateful emotion. She gave him a shy glance, full of gratitude. At this moment a loud shout of disappointment came from Jasper. \"By St Edmund, thy falcon hath risen above the heron, and will strike in another second!\" This was too much for Ralph. With a joyous bound he left the new-comers on his pony, and ran after his brother, just in time to see his gerfalcon give a swoop, and the next minute descend like a falling bolt right on to the doomed heron, who, however, with prompt instinct, turned up its long neck, and held its beak like a sword on which the falcon should impale itself. \"Gare beak, my beauty; strike him sideways. There, by all the saints, she has done it! There they come. Ah! Melampus; ah! Ringwood; heel, sir, heel!\" And the boy ran as hard as he could to the spot where the heron, still struggling, but feebly, was falling with the hawk\u0027s claws and talons fixed firmly in its back, and its strong beak pecking into its brain. \"Well done! well sped, brave bird!\" cried Ralph joyously. \"Ay, but I have lost my riding-whip,\" said Jasper ruefully. \"Nay, Jasp, I will never take it; \u0027twas but in sport.\" And thus the first flight of Ralph\u0027s gerfalcon ended. They recalled the goshawk, and with hawks hooded, jesses on legs, and fast on fists, they returned home, carrying the heron with them.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1700/50047.html","bookId":1153,"book":{"id":1153,"title":"The Captain of the Wight","description":"简介： Among the many aspects in which it is possible to regard this important epoch, that of its influence on chivalry is one of the most interesting.
