{"id":13278,"no":9,"title":"CHAPTER VIII. HOW THE COCKEREL GOT A FALL.","content":"\"What art thou?\" stammered Ralph, as soon as he had recovered from his surprise. \"What dost thou mean by thy talk of Balaam?\" \"Look, boy, and thou wilt see,\" answered the dark figure, which every second was becoming more clearly defined in the gloom. Without Ralph having noticed it, the mist had been growing lighter for the last quarter of an hour. The atmosphere, while still densely thick, was yet paler and more luminous, and immediate objects were more easily distinguished. Hardly had the strange figure spoken the words, than the vapour which enveloped them parted, and a wonderful sight presented itself to the eyes of the awe-struck boy. Was it all a dream? or was he really standing, or floating in mid air? He could hardly repress a shudder of unutterable awe, so strange was the sudden change from the blackness of night to the brilliantly weird scene before him. He was standing on the very verge of a fearful precipice, so close that he could peer over from the saddle down, down, far down to a rocky shore below, where the sea, in seething surf, was beating and grinding and gnawing at the black rocks scattered in wildest confusion on the strand. At his side was a vast, yawning black chasm impossible for him to fathom, shrouded as it was in the deep shadow of the bold headland beyond. Tophet itself could hardly be blacker or more fearful looking. The grim gloom of this awful abyss, at the very edge of which he was standing, made the flesh creep on his bones. One step more, and he would have plunged he knew not whither. Above this terrible place the clinging mist still veiled the scene. But Ralph could see that the hills and cliffs went soaring up till lost in obscurity. Right from the feet of the dazed boy, but far, far down, a broad path of dancing light stretched away and away till a grey and silver cloud under the clear full moon hid it in its soft embrace, as it lay brooding over the sea. How lovely was the dancing sea, how glorious the moon, how wondrous the violet of the deep sky of night. Ralph had never seen anything like it, and yet how near to awful death had he been. The ghostly mist curled up over the edge of the cliff, the strange white shapes went silently floating by like ghosts of the shipwrecked dead, or a still army of spirits flying inland to visit their midnight homes. Silently as the strange scene had opened, so stilly and impalpably it faded away. In another moment all was gone, and the boy and the dark figure were alone in the thick fog, nothing visible of all that wondrous scene but themselves and the few feet of turf on which they stood. Ralph could hardly believe it was reality. Surely it must be all a dream. \"Now, my young master, believest thou? Dost understand where thou art?\" \"Nay, not I; it seemeth to me I dream.\" \"Ay, marry, that wouldest thou soon, if indeed men do dream in that sleep which they call death,\" said the deep voice bitterly. Ralph could not make out this dark figure. He had not looked at it during the fitful light which opened up that strange sight only to disappear in greater obscurity than before. He now tried to examine the form of him who uttered such enigmatical remarks in so well-cultured a voice. He saw a tall figure, strong and well made, with a hood over its head, such as were worn by the courtiers of ages long gone by, and which Ralph had seen depicted in tapestry and illuminations of King Edward the Third\u0027s time. A tight-fitting tunic strapped at the waist by a belt, from which gleamed the hilt of a dagger, and the head of a small axe, showed he was both active and well-armed. But Ralph could see nothing of the man\u0027s face, or make out whether his clothes were of those of gentle birth or of the common stuff worn by the country men and labourers. \"Well, my master, and how long may it please you to stay here, and what may be your business?\" Ralph did not like the tone of bantering superiority the other assumed; he answered:-- \"Marry, good fellow, what is that to thee? An thou canst tell me where I am, and whither to go to St Catherine\u0027s down, that is all I want of thee.\" \"So thou wouldest go to St Catherine\u0027s down, wouldest thou? And what may be your business there?\" \"Thou art parlous curious, good knave,\" said Ralph haughtily. \"I pray you ask me no questions, but tell me what I wish to know.\" \"Body o\u0027 me, this is a fine springald,\" said the other. \"But before I tell thee what thou wouldest know, thou must tell me what I would know.\" \"And what is that?\" \"What is thy business at this hour from the Captain of the Wight with the hermit of St Catherine\u0027s?\" \"That shalt thou never know!\" cried Ralph hotly. \"Then thou mayest grope here in the darkness until thy carcase becometh a prey to the sea-mews, or a feast for the crabs on yonder beach.\" \"Base churl! thou deservedst chastisement for thine insolence!\" cried Ralph, whose temper was becoming provoked. \"But I will e\u0027en do without thy niggard help.\" And Ralph got off his horse, and prepared to grope his way to where the smell of smoke still met his nostrils. \"Nay, Sir Page, thou goest not thus,\" said the man, stepping in front of him, and at the same time putting his finger to his mouth he gave a prolonged whistle like the shrill scream of a sea-bird. Ralph laid his hand on his sword, seeing there was evidently mischief intended. But before he could draw it, his wrist was held as in a vice, and in a second his other arm was grasped, and with a quick trip of the foot, he found himself prostrate on the grass, the man kneeling on him, and holding him immovable. \"Struggle not, young master, or thou wilt suffer. Thou art powerless to do aught, so better lie still.\" But Ralph was furious. With the rage of mortified pride--for he had never been mastered before--he struggled, kicked, and writhed, and even tried to bite the hands that held him with a grasp of iron. He had never felt such power in human hands before. \"Marry, \u0027tis a fierce youth and a strong,\" muttered the man. \"I shall have to do him a mischief, an they come not soon. Ah! would you?\" he said, as Ralph\u0027s hand wriggled to get at his poignard, and in a trice the arm was wrenched out stiff and straight, and kept pinioned to the ground. Never had Ralph believed man could be so strong. But, still unconquered, the boy struggled with his legs, and raised himself off the ground with his heels. By a violent uplifting of his knees, he hit his captor a fierce blow in the back, causing him to fall forward on his face. With a desperate heave the boy pursued his advantage, and in another moment would have upset his adversary, when he felt his legs caught and pulled roughly down, once more he was utterly powerless. \"Now, stripling,\" said his first assailant, still holding his arms stretched out, but getting off the boy\u0027s chest, where he had been crushing the breath out of his body, \"I told you it would be all for naught your wrestling like that. Will you tell me what you have come here for?\" \"Never,\" said Ralph resolutely. \"Then, Bill,\" said his captor, \"we shall even have to search him.\" Before Ralph knew what was happening, he felt his arms held by another man, while the first speaker carefully searched his pockets. \"There\u0027s naught here,\" he said, in a disappointed tone, as he turned out the contents of Ralph\u0027s small clothes and tunic, and examined the miscellaneous collection of utterly useless articles which boys, from the earliest days down to the present, have set their hearts on forming, to the detriment of their pockets, the aggravation of their female relatives, and the marring of their own figure. \"Nay, but there is,\" said the man who held his legs; \"look\u0027ee there, there\u0027s summat whoite i\u0027 the grass.\" \"Marry, so there is!\" and the first speaker picked up the missive of the Captain of the Wight and turned it over. \"You base villains,\" said Ralph, \"an you touch that, you will repent it!\" A loud laugh greeted this remark; and the first speaker, rising, held the paper up to see if he could make anything out of it. \"I can\u0027t make it out,\" he said. \"I must e\u0027en take it to the light.\" \"And what are we to do wi\u0027 the lad while you be gone? Shall us knife un and pitch un over to cliff?\" \"Body o\u0027 me, no! Do him no harm; hold him till I come back.\" So saying, the first speaker disappeared from Ralph\u0027s line of sight. The moon had again come out, and as Ralph lay on his back, he could just manage, by wriggling his head, to look on each side of him. He could see that the men who held him were rough figures, clad in coarse hairy clothes, possibly skins of animals. The moonlight fell on their hair and beards, giving them a wild and ferocious appearance; and long knives, whose hilts stuck out of their belts, gleamed in the silver light. Who were they, and what could they mean by attacking him? and, above all, how could they dare, in so small an island, to defy so powerful an authority as that of the Captain of the Wight? As he lay on his back, Ralph caught sight of a light; at first he took it for a star, but it flickered and flared in so strange a way, that he soon knew it could not be. Surely it must be a fire, and, if so, there must be men near. Ralph felt a hope of aid; he tried to shout aloud, but the first sound he uttered caused the man who was holding his arms to clap his hand over his mouth, and effectually to stop all further cries. In vain Ralph seized his arm with his disengaged hand. The other man, who was tired of holding his legs, had seated himself upon them; his arms were therefore free. He leant forward, and grasped Ralph\u0027s hand, and roughly made him let go his grip of his companion. \"Best give it up, young \u0027un,\" he said gruffly, as he held the arm in no gentle hold. \"There\u0027s naught can hear thee save the Gaffer and the sea mews.\" \"Then what\u0027s that light?\" asked Ralph, as the man relaxed the pressure on his mouth. \"\u0027Tis the light on St Catherine, and \u0027tis a good mile or more away.\" \"Then where am I?\" \"Where are you? Why, on the ground, to be sure,\" laughed the man. Ralph\u0027s anger rose, but it was utterly useless, he could do nothing. After lying still for another minute or more, one of the men said,-- \"The Gaffer is a long while; maybe he can\u0027t spell out them words.\" \"Surely he\u0027s larnt his chriss-cross row long ago,\" said the other derisively. \"Ay, right enough, mate, but them letters may be t\u0027other sort.\" \"Well, and if they be, ain\u0027t he got Mistress Magdalen to read it for him?\" \"Hold your tongue, you lubber; here he comes.\" Ralph could just manage to see the head of his captor rising out of the mist, and from the distinctness with which he saw his figure develop, he knew the edge of the cliff must be very near, as indeed he had already seen. \"Master Page, here\u0027s thy missive; there\u0027s naught in it that concerneth me, so thou mayest e\u0027en take it to the Hermit of St Catherine\u0027s; but when thou returnest to the Castle, give this message to thy lord; thou needest not to say who gave it thee--he will ask no questions.\" Ralph now felt his captors relax their hold, in another second he was free. He rose to his feet, the men had already disappeared. He looked round; there was nothing to be seen of any living being; only his horse was browsing tranquilly a few paces off, and two white bits of parchment lay on the grass. Picking these up, he went to the edge of the cliff. The sea was restlessly seething and surging among the rocks, each ripple and wave rolling like molten silver to the iron-bound coast. Every crevice and rock stood out sharp and clear in the brilliant moonlight, only marking in blacker contrast the hideous gloom of the yawning chasm at his side. He could see no path, yet the men must have gone down that way, or else he would have seen them had they ventured to clamber down the precipice in front. He stood up and looked round--the light had disappeared. Had they told him the truth about that light? Was it the Hermitage of St Catherine\u0027s? But there was none to ask, and he felt as bewildered as ever, nay, more so, for he had utterly lost his bearings. And then he thought of his lord\u0027s command, and of the urgency of the matter. What should he do? With the recklessness of despair, he bawled aloud,-- \"You varlets, which way am I to go to get to St Catherine\u0027s?\" But only the echo from the blackness beyond answered mockingly \"Catherine\" in quivering note, and the waves surged ceaselessly below. He cried again,--\"You caitiffs, you, why don\u0027t you answer?\" and the echo laughed back \"answer,\" but none other answer came. \"\u0027Tis little use,\" he muttered, in sullen bitterness of spirit; \"but I will yet find out where that smoke came from.\" He looked at his horse, how should he tether him? He saw beyond, and nearer the head of the chasm, a few bushes growing. Carefully he led his horse along the edge of the abyss, marvelling how he had escaped so awful a death, and regretfully thinking how he had chidden his noble horse, whose sensible instinct had saved both their lives. When he reached the bushes, he saw that he was on the brink of a deep gully, but the ground was all broken and boggy, and covered with closely-growing bush, bramble, and scrub. The mist was gathering up afresh. Great banks of vapour were scudding across the moon, and flitting up the black chasm, suddenly appearing in the moonlight out of the darkness below, like steam out of a cauldron. While he was debating what to do, he was startled by a gentle voice almost at his elbow. Turning quickly round, he saw a graceful figure standing on the edge of the gully, looking like black marble against the broad path of silver glory that stretched across the sea behind it. \"Fair sir, whither wouldst thou go?\" said the voice. \"If thou art of real flesh and blood, gentle damoiselle, I would thank thee to tell me which is my way to St Catherine\u0027s Hermitage.\" \"And thou wouldst not thank me if I were not real flesh and blood?\" \"Ay, marry would I, an\u0027 thou wert Sathanas himself!\" cried the youth impatiently, \"if only I could escape from this quagmire of a hole.\" \"Thou art not over-courteous, Sir Page,\" said the gentle voice. \"Certes, fair damsel, I crave thy pardon, but I am much belated, and have been sorely bested. I cry your mercy. But tell me, an thou canst, how I can find the Hermit of St Catherine\u0027s?\" \"Right easily, fair sir. Seest thou yonder hill to thy right?\" \"The fire I saw was to the left, I\u0027ll wager my falcon,\" said Ralph; then he added aloud, \"Marry, do I, fair damsel.\" \"Then ride straight up that hill--there is naught save a few rough stones to hinder thee; only walk thy horse carefully till thou gettest upon hard ground, as \u0027tis all quick about here. Nay, I will show thee,\" added the figure quickly; \"\u0027tis but a poor return for thy kindness to us.\" \"And when did I show kindness to thee, gentle damsel?\" said Ralph, in astonishment. \"Thou quickly forgettest thy good deeds, I see,\" said the girl. \"\u0027Tis a good sign of one gently nurtured.\" \"But when saw I thee before?\" \"I did not say thou hadst seen me before!\" \"Marry, fair damsel, thou speakest in riddles. I did thee a kindness, and yet did not see thee! A-read me the riddle?\" \"Nay, \u0027tis best to forget the kindnesses you do, so long as they to whom they are done keep them in mind. There, now, thou art on safe ground. Ride boldly up the hill. At the summit thou wilt see the beacon light. Fare-thee-well.\" \"But, damsel, wilt thou not tell me thy name? Who are those caitiffs who wrought me such wrong? Where dwellest thou? How camest thou here?\" \"And then men call us poor women curious and prying,\" laughed the girl. \"Good-night, gentle sir, mayest thou prosper, and have a pleasant journey;\" and before Ralph realised she was gone, she had disappeared down the head of the gully. \"Well, \u0027tis little use following her,\" thought Ralph; \"my business is up there. I marvel whether she told me truth; but I shall soon see.\" He mounted his horse, and pursued his way as fast as he could, consistently with the steepness of the ascent. So steep was the hill in some places, that he dismounted once more, and led his horse up. He had no idea the hill was so high or so difficult to climb, from the view he had had of it below, but at length he found the steep incline becoming rounder and more level. Mounting again, he set spurs to his horse, and galloped over the smooth, close-cropped, wind-shorn grass. After riding a few hundred yards, he saw a bright glow before him, and in another minute he was trotting up to a low building with a small octagonal tower, on the top of which was a cresset holding a mass of flaming tow and faggots, which cast a lurid glare all over the summit of the lofty down. It was St Catherine\u0027s Chapel and Hermitage. As Ralph rode up, the figure of a man in a monk\u0027s dress emerged in the tower, and attended to the fire. \"Art thou the Hermit of St Catherine?\" called out Ralph. The monk turned round. \"Who is it that calls?\" \"One of the Captain of the Wight\u0027s pages, who has come with a missive for thee.\" \"Tarry, my son, till I come down,\" said the Hermit. The figure then disappeared, and shortly afterwards a low door at the base of the tower opened, and the Hermit came out, holding a lantern in his hand. He carefully scrutinised Ralph without saying anything, and took the paper the page handed to him. After reading it attentively, he said,-- \"Tell my lord there hath been no strange sail seen to-day, but as it is parlous thick to-night, and was so the greater part of the afternoon, a vessel might have passed without my seeing. Tell his lordship I will be sure to keep a trusty look-out.\" \"Is that all, holy father?\" \"Yes, my son; get thee back as soon as may be, for it behoveth him to take measures in case a schallop hath gotten past unperceived.\" Ralph turned his horse\u0027s head; the mist was now far down below, and dispersing before it spread inland. His road lay clear before him. Clapping spurs to his horse, he galloped off, and in the course of another hour was hallooing to the guard at the outer gate of the Castle to open and let him in. In a few minutes more he had dismounted at the Captain\u0027s apartments, given his horse to Humphrey, who was sitting up for him, and in another second was ushered into the presence of the Captain of the Wight.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1700/50054.html","bookId":1153,"book":{"id":1153,"title":"The Captain of the Wight","description":"简介： Among the many aspects in which it is possible to regard this important epoch, that of its influence on chivalry is one of the most interesting.
