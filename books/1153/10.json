{"id":13279,"no":10,"title":"CHAPTER IX. HOW THE COCKEREL LEARNT HARDIHOOD.","content":"When Ralph pushed aside the heavy curtain which hung inside the ill-fitting but massive oak door, he was for a moment dazed by the brilliant light within the room. \n \n The chambers of the more luxurious nobles were at this time fitted up with much profusion of rich draperies, gorgeous tapestries, and splendidly carved and gilded furniture. Lord Woodville inherited and shared all the lavish tastes of his mother and his family. His brother, the ill-fated Lord Scales, had been the patron of Caxton, having himself translated and composed some of the earliest works published by the Father of Printing, and the Captain of the Wight upheld the traditions of his house. \n \n Seated before an elaborately-carved desk, lighted by long wax candles standing in exquisitely-designed brass candlesticks, whose bold bosses and delicate spiral work reflected the light in countless sparkles and scintillations, sat the Lord Woodville, his handsome face in conspicuous distinctness with the light shining full upon it, while behind hung a gorgeous tapestry from the looms of Flanders, which had belonged to his mother, Jacquetta of Luxemburg. He was clad in a close-fitting short tunic of black stamped velvet, made very full across the chest and shoulders, and drawn in with narrowing pleats at the waist, where it was confined by a magnificent belt of scarlet Cordovan leather, richly studded with gold and jewelled mountings. A finely-chased silver-hilted poignard hung at his right side, and his shapely legs were set off to fullest advantage by his tight-fitting hose, which, after the fashion of the time, were parti-coloured, of light blue and white in alternate pieces. Long and fanciful scarlet Cordovan slippers encased his feet, and a rich purple mantle, lined with the fur of the silver fox, hung over the back of his chair. One elegantly-formed hand rested on the desk, where a few characters had been inscribed on a sheet of paper before him, while the other arm hung negligently over the back of his chair. There was a dreamy, far-away look in his eyes, and no one could have realised in that slightly effeminate figure, and almost womanish face, with its sensitive mouth and finely-chiselled nose and broad brow, round which the long hair fell in waving masses, the warrior who had fought in nearly all the bloodiest battles of those fierce civil wars, and had borne himself in ranged field or tented lists \"righte hardilie, valyentlie, and of full lusty prowess.\" For the conflict on the battle-field was then no child\u0027s play as regards the noble, to whom quarter in those bloody civil wars was rarely or never given. \n \n It was probably the refined tastes of the Woodvilles, while rendering them such favourites with the luxurious Edward IV. and the ladies of his court, which caused the ruder barons of that rough age to hate them so bitterly. The taunt flung in the face of Lord Rivers and his son by Warwick, when he was brought before him a prisoner at Calais, showed the malignity of hate and contempt the nobles felt for the family, a hatred arising, no doubt, from jealousy at the Woodvilles\u0027 sudden rise to distinction, but aggravated by a contempt for their accomplishments, which were considered totally inconsistent with the stern realities of life. How was it possible that a hardy knight and well-seasoned man-at-arms could find time to paint, write, or even read? Such occupations were for jongleurs or monks, not belted knights and stout barons. \n \n As Ralph dropped the curtain behind him, the Captain of the Wight rose from his chair, the dreamy look of abstraction giving place to the alertness of real life. \n \n \"Well, Master Lisle, thou hast been a dullard on the way; what hath made thee so late?\" \n \n \"There was a thick mist abroad, my lord.\" \n \n \"Oh, and thou lost thy way? Like enough. These sea fogs are sudden in their uprising. But thou gavest my missive to the Hermit?\" \n \n \"Yea, my lord, and he bid me say that he had seen no sail, but that, as the mist had overspread the land and sea the latter part of the day, it were very possible for a schallop to have gotten past unnoticed.\" \n \n \"Yea, forsooth, he sayeth well,\" said the Captain thoughtfully; then he added, \"There was no other message?\" \n \n \"None my lord, save--\" and Ralph hesitated, for he did not like to tell of his mishaps, and as he thought of the strange adventure on the wild cliff, in the brilliant light of that luxurious room, he could scarcely believe it was not a dream. The utter contrast between the present moment, the elegant surroundings, the absolute security of that splendid castle, with all its guards, walls, men-at-arms, bastions, archers, and turrets, and the wild weirdness of that solitary wrestle on the verge of the black precipice, in the cold light of the moon, and the ghostly vapour, seemed too impossible. Surely he must have dreamt it. \n \n \"Save what, my child?\" said Lord Woodville. \n \n \"Save that I lost my way, and--\" and again he hesitated. \n \n \"Well, my page, and what?\" \n \n \"And I was set on by a base caitiff.\" \n \n \"Ay, marry--who has dared to lay hands on one of my pages?\" \n \n \"That I know not, my lord,\" and then Ralph narrated the adventure as best he could. \n \n Lord Woodville listened to the end, his countenance expressing no feeling until Ralph came to the part where the man bid him take a note to the Captain of the Wight. He then looked up gravely, and said, \n \n \"Where is it, my child?\" \n \n Ralph fumbled in his pocket; he searched everywhere--he could not find it. Seeing his nervousness, the Lord Woodville said, smiling,-- \n \n \"Nay, fair page, take it quietly; thou mayest have overlooked it. Search each of thy pockets one by one, and so we shall arrive at a just conclusion.\" \n \n Ralph did as he was told, and displayed but few things to the amused eyes of Lord Woodville, for he had not troubled to replace the rubbish which the man had left upon the grass when he turned out his pockets. When all had been gone through, there was nothing found. \n \n \"My lord,\" said Ralph, abashed, \"I must have dropped it when I delivered thy missive to the Hermit of St Catherine\u0027s.\" \n \n \"Like enough, my page; but thou shouldest be more careful. An thou didst, I shall get it in the morning; or thou canst ride in search of it. But thou art sure thou hast not been dreaming?\" added Lord Woodville, with a smile. \n \n \"Nay, my lord, that I will warrant, for thou mayest see the stain of the grass and the earth on my surcoat and hose.\" \n \n \"Well that is somewhat, certes, but \u0027tis a quaint tale. Who could they be who would attack thee, do thee no harm, take no gold from thee, or strip thee of thy rich poignard and gaudy dress? For I see they have left thee thy purse and gold pieces.\" \n \n \"Nay, my lord, I know not; but I can show thee the place to-morrow, an thou wilt ride thither.\" \n \n \"What was the man like who captured you? Didst thou see his face?\" \n \n \"Nay, my lord, for he ever came between me and the moon; but he was of marvellous strength, and of a wondrous bigness; and he spoke like one in authority, and of gentle birth and breeding.\" \n \n \"Well, \u0027tis a strange adventure, in sooth, and we will take thought for it to-morrow. Perchance thou mayest find the missive in thy saddle housings, or in thy dress, as thou retirest to sleep. But it groweth late; get thee now to thy rest. I shall need thee to-morrow.\" \n \n So saying, Lord Woodville nodded kindly to the boy, as a sign for him to retire, and Ralph left the room, glad enough to have escaped so easily, marvelling more than ever whether what had happened had really been a dream. \n \n Meanwhile the Captain of the Wight stood musing before his fire, for there was now need for a fire, since the season was drawing on, and it was near the end of September, while the thick stone walls of the strong building were damp and cold. \n \n Presently he went to his desk, pressed a spring, and out of a drawer at the side he took a little scented leathern case. Opening this, he took out two very faded flowers, a long lock of wavy soft brown hair, and a golden heart. He gazed at the silent relics, his lips moved, and he crossed himself devoutly. He then, after pressing them to his lips, put them back in the case, shut the case up, and replaced it in the drawer, which he carefully fastened again. \n \n This done, with a heavy sigh he stepped across to a prie dieu, and devoutly kneeling before a richly-carved crucifix, he remained absorbed in prayer. When he rose up, his face looked white and haggard. Before retiring to rest, he drew aside the curtain over his door, opened it, and called to the archer on guard to pass the word to the man who relieved him, to usher, without question, any monk who should come to him in the morning. \n \n When Ralph awoke next morning, the events of the previous night seemed more than ever like a dream. The commonplace realities of everyday life, the bright morning sun, the boyish chaff of his companions, and the decisive tone of Tom o\u0027 Kingston as he put them through their exercises, seemed so utterly out of keeping with the romantic adventure of the night before. \n \n Dicky Cheke seemed somewhat crestfallen this morning, and he and Maurice Woodville had each a rather swollen cheek and lip, while Willie Newenhall was decidedly puffy and red about the eye. \n \n Even Bowerman showed signs of the manful handling given him by Ralph, who had almost forgotten the scuffle, in the greater excitement that had followed. \n \n \"I\u0027 faith, Ralph,\" said Dicky Cheke, \"there\u0027ll be war anon, and Bowerman shall grin. What do you think? After you had gone, and the Captain had gotten well away, that rogue \u0027Pig\u0027s Eyes\u0027 got Bowerman to attack us; but we gave them enough work before we gave in, and that\u0027s why his eye\u0027s so wadged up, and Bowerman\u0027s nose looks so red about the bridge.\" \n \n \"Now, Master Cheke,\" called out Tom o\u0027 Kingston, \"are you going to give over gossiping? I hear there\u0027s talk of a tilt toward, and that Sir John thinks two of you young men can break a lance in it. Now I\u0027d be loth you bore yourselves boorishly, so please to give heed to all I\u0027ve to say to you. Master Bowerman, you look but sadly this morning; what\u0027s come to your nose?\" \n \n \"Never mind my nose, Tom,\" said that youth sulkily. \"It\u0027s no business of yours if my nose is well or amiss. Let me have a run at you with the lance; I want to practise against a live man.\" \n \n \"Not this morning, Master Bowerman; you\u0027ve enough to do to hit the Saracen fairly. Now are you ready. Go!\" \n \n The boys were all mounted on their hackneys horses that formed part of the stud of the castle garrison, and which were trained for the work. Each boy carried a lance about thirteen feet long, and they were this morning going to tilt at a large and roughly-made figure of a Saracen, who held a shield in one arm, and a loose club in the other. The figure, when hit on the shield, spun round, and, unless the performer were quick in his movements, caught its assailant a more or less violent blow in the back, depending upon the force with which the shield was hit. \n \n At the word of command of Tom o\u0027 Kingston, Bowerman dug his heels into his horse\u0027s side and rode at the figure. He hit the shield fairly, and galloped past untouched, raising his lance as he trotted round. \n \n \"That\u0027s well done, but give him a harder buffet next time. Now, Master Newenhall!\" cried the instructor. \n \n Willie Newenhall was but half awake. He was yawning desperately when he received the order to go. He had scarcely fastened up his clothes, and he looked a sodden mass of sleepy stupidity. His half-washed face, squat nose, and little eyes, which were now smaller than ever, owing to the events of the night before, did not look prepossessing, and not the uttermost vagaries of the most vivid imagination would have thought that the owner of that countenance and that appearance fancied himself to be a dangerous lady-killer, a cause of disquiet alike to the anxious husband as well as the fond father. But the nights of fancy are proverbially wild, and had anybody suggested to Willie Newenhall that he was anything else than a very handsome, irresistible youth, he would have regarded that person with the pitying scorn justly due to the envious and the blighted. Sleepy, and unfinished in the matter of his toilette--for it was seven o\u0027clock in the morning, and Willie dearly loved his bed--he heard the order to put his horse in motion at the quintain. With another prolonged yawn he shook his horse\u0027s reins, and trotted lazily towards the post. It so happened that he had not fastened up his tunic properly. As the pace of the horse increased, and he prepared to level his spear to hit the shield, the tunic flew open, and got in the way of his arms. Forgetting, or not noticing, how near he was to the quintain, he moved his arm up to clear the dress, thus bringing the lance across his body, and before he had time to recover his position, the long spear struck athwart the quintain, and got askew between the shield and the wooden post on which it revolved, with the effect of its becoming jammed and immovable. As Willie\u0027s horse was well trained, and had increased his speed on nearing the quintain, his rider was swept out of his saddle, and over the crupper, falling to the ground like a sack of flour. \n \n The onlookers greeted this mishap with a roar of laughter, and their instructor, with whom Willie Newenhall was no favourite, scoffingly bid him pick himself up, and \"not lie there like a trussed pullet.\" \n \n Ruefully the sleepy page, now rudely awakened, got up, and came limping back. \n \n \"Pick up thy lance, stupid, and go after thy nag. Beshrew me, but an I were the Captain, I\u0027d as lief have a turnip for a page as thee. For you both grow, and that\u0027s all; saving that a turnip is good to eat, which is more than can be said o\u0027 thee.\" Then turning to Ralph, Tom o\u0027 Kingston said, \"Now, Master Lisle, do thou show them how to do the matter.\" \n \n Ralph dearly loved these exercises, and had become an apt pupil. Sticking spurs to his horse, he cantered eagerly forward. As he neared the post, with knees and voice he encouraged his horse, and with loose reins and gathering speed he struck the quintain a vigorous blow; then, raising his lance aloft, galloped on, untouched by the swiftly-revolving club. \n \n \"By my faith, \u0027twas well done, young master! You\u0027ll make the best lance of them all. But, when all\u0027s said and done, that\u0027s not much praise neither.\" \n \n \"You\u0027re a bit grumpy this morning--Tom,\" said Dicky Cheke. \"What\u0027s gone wrong? Has Polly Bremeskate been unkind to thee?\" \n \n \"Now, Master Cheke, mind your work, and let me have none of your sauce,\" said Tom o\u0027 Kingston, who was supposed to cherish a fatal passion for this very buxom and florid spinster, who was the inheritor of certain lands and tenements sufficient to be a powerful attraction, over and above her other charms, to the yeomen of the island. Her suitors therefore were numerous, and she gave herself airs of importance becoming in one so happily placed. \n \n Dicky and Maurice went through the performance very well, and after the exercise had been repeated several times, the little group was joined by the Breton knight and Sir John Trenchard. \n \n The arrival of these important spectators caused the performers to try their best, and even the stolid Willie was roused into something like emulation. \n \n \"How do they tackle to their work, Master Tom?\" asked Sir John. \n \n \"There\u0027s naught amiss, Sir John, with Master Bowerman and Lisle; they\u0027ll bear themselves well enough--leastways the last-named gentleman will; and so, for their size, will the other two young masters. But as for Master Newenhall, you\u0027d as well mount Betty the scullery wench on Jenny the donkey, and give her a broomstick, as let him ride among press of knights.\" \n \n \"Go in, boys, and don your breastpieces, brassarts, gauntlets, and burgonets, and get your targets. This worshipful knight and I would see how you can bear yourselves in a tilt.\" \n \n It was delightful news to all the pages, except Willie Newenhall, who in his heart detested the whole thing, and would much rather have sat at the window where Lady Trenchard\u0027s maids were looking at the sports, than have been down there, jeered at by the others, and with a strong probability of receiving hard knocks. If only he could gossip, he was happy. He could scarcely open his mouth among men, but with a garrulous woman--if only she were married, or beyond the chance of having designs upon himself--he was quite at home, and would discuss by the hour the latest fashion in \u0027cotes hardies,\u0027 or \u0027furbelows,\u0027 or any other of the mysteries usually never spoken of by men, or, if referred to at all, mentioned with bated breath, as though conscious of venturing on unknown ground, and with the usual result of bringing ridicule upon themselves, by the utter ignorance they displayed. But not so with Willie. He was as much at home when discussing women\u0027s dress or idle gossip and scandal, as his companions were at handling the lance or throwing the bar. \n \n In a few minutes more the pages all re-appeared, armed entirely from the waist upwards in polished steel their faces looking bright and boyish under their raised visors, with their shields on their left arms. At the word \u0027Mount,\u0027 they vaulted into the saddle, or attempted to do so, for although they were practised every day at this exercise, yet it was a difficult matter to accomplish in armour. Bowerman and Ralph, owing to the advantage of height, were able to do it gracefully enough, but poor Dicky ignominiously failed, while Maurice managed to scramble up with loss of dignity, but ultimate success. Willie had also failed, and received a sharp rebuke from Sir John Trenchard. When at last, by dint of great struggles, the two unfortunates had got on their horses, they were ranged in a line, sitting motionless with lance erect and visor raised. \n \n The scene was pretty. The morning drill took place in the castle yard properly so called; the place of arms outside the walls, on the east of the castle, not being used for the lesser exercises. The five martial figures of the youths, their fresh boyish faces, contrasting with their warlike panoply, the graceful figure of the Breton knight, in his close-fitting tunic and picturesque dress, set off to advantage by the grizzled head and weather-beaten appearance of Sir John Trenchard, formed a becoming contrast to the burly form and soldierly bearing of the esquire, sitting his horse to the right of the little squad, and completing the group on the yellow gravel of the yard. Behind all, the towering keep, with its base hidden by thick brushwood, carefully trimmed and topped, stood up dark and grim against the eastern sky. To the south east, Mountjoy\u0027s Tower, and the long line of wall between, cast their deep shadows over the barracks and store-houses below; while opposite, in the bright sunlight, was the old chapel of St Nicholas, the chaplain\u0027s room, guard-room, and the noble towers of the main gateway. The Captain\u0027s apartments, on the north, commanded a view on three sides into the yard, and the boys were made more eager than ever to do well, by seeing the Captain of the Wight standing in the oriel window, looking down upon them. \n \n About the quadrangle were grouped, some in shadow some in bright sunlight, the picturesque figures of the garrison of the castle who were off duty, while the flitting shadows on the parapet of the eastern walls showed where the sentries were pacing to and fro on their beat. \n \n Above the keep floated the standard of England, and from the main tower the banner of the Captain of the Wight flung its blazon in the breeze. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1700/50055.html","bookId":1153,"book":{"id":1153,"title":"The Captain of the Wight","description":"简介： Among the many aspects in which it is possible to regard this important epoch, that of its influence on chivalry is one of the most interesting.
