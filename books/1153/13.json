{"id":13282,"no":13,"title":"CHAPTER XII. HOW THE COCKEREL FELT HE WAS BUT A COCKEREL.","content":"The old Priory of Appuldurcombe was situated in a most lovely spot, nestling in thick woods whose brown and russet foliage climbed the steep sides of the lofty downs surrounding it; the high-pitched gable of the little chapel, and the quaintly-grouped pile of grey buildings, looked serene and peaceful in that sequestered nook amid the ever-lasting hills. Originally granted by the piety of stout Earl Richard de Redvers to his new foundation of Montsburg in Normandy, it was used as a cell for a prior and two monks to look after their farms of Appuldurcombe, Sandford, and Week. But, sharing the fate of other alien foundations, it was taken from them by Henry IV. and granted to the nuns of St Clare, without Aldgate, who eventually obtained a grant of it from the Monastery of Montsburg, and so possessed it until the dissolution of the monasteries. The Convent of St Clare, without Aldgate, at this time was accustomed to send two sisters and a prioress to look after their interests, and used the cell as a place of peaceful resort and change of air from London. The sisters could walk in these retired woods and sheltered groves without fear of observation or molestation, and were much beloved by the labourers on the farms belonging to the Nunnery. It is quite evident from Chaucer that the nuns did not always observe the strictest seclusion, even in the Metropolis; and how well some at least of them were versed in the pleasures and technicalities of field sports is abundantly clear in the works of Dame Juliana Berners, popularly supposed to have been Prioress of Sopewell, near St Albans. As the Captain of the Wight rode up with Yolande and Ralph, the chapel bell ceased. \"We will wait till their orisons be over,\" said Lord Woodville. They had now leisure to look round, and even the matter-of-fact Ralph and high-spirited Yolande were impressed with the still loveliness of the scene. The blue smoke from the conventual kitchen and labourers\u0027 cottages curled into the quiet air, and floated away amid the rich brown leaves of the autumnal wood. The grass, green and soft, like velvet to the tread, showed the fertility of the soil, and the lowing of the cows, which were being driven from their pasture, added a pastoral melody to the sylvan scene. An old woman and a young girl came out of a small door pierced in the high stone wall which surrounded the little settlement, and hid the lower storey from outward observation. \"What a pretty child!\" said Yolande, with generous admiration. \"Did you ever see such eyes?\" Ralph looked as he was told, but, boy like, paid little attention to the looks of a girl evidently younger than himself. Besides, in comparison with the brilliant Yolande, whose every movement was grace, and every word fascination, how could he admire aught else? And was not Yolande, in addition, at least four years older than himself? The soft eyes of the girl, however, seemed to recognise Ralph. She gave him a shy little nod of welcome and acknowledgment. \"Why, my cousin, she knoweth thee!\" said Yolande. \"Who is she?\" \"Nay, I know not,\" said Ralph, not quite pleased at being nodded to in that familiar way by so poorly clad a little girl. \"Good mother,\" said the Captain of the Wight, \"wilt thou ask the Lady Prioress if she will grant this fair lady a draught of ale or hippocras?\" The old woman only shook her head, but the girl glanced up at the Captain\u0027s face, and then said,-- \"Noble sir, Gammer Audrey is deaf. I will run in and ask Sister Agnes,\" and the child drew her hand out of that of the old woman, and disappeared through the door. \"\u0027Tis strange!\" muttered the Lord Woodville; \"her eyes are wondrous like, and the voice--old memories are stirring, methinks, to-day.\" In a few minutes the figure of a nun carrying a tray on which were a flagon and some pewter cups, appeared at the narrow door, followed by the girl, bearing a dish with a few apples piled upon it. The nun had hardly passed out of the door when she gave a little stagger, and nearly dropped the things she was carrying. Recovering herself with an effort, she approached Yolande. \"My faith, my Lord Woodville, if the girl were lovely, what think you of the sister?\" said Yolande. Lord Woodville looked at the nun, as she approached, and became deadly pale. \"How could it be!\" he murmured. \"I heard she was dead!\" \"Well,\" observed Yolande, \"of all strange things, this is the most parlous bewildering! Who\u0027d have thought the unmoved Lord Woodville could be so passing stirred twice in the same hour?\" The nun poured out the hippocras, and offered it to Yolande, who took it from the fair hand of the draped and veiled figure, with the curiosity and awe which all women feel when brought face to face with one of their own sex who is utterly dead to the world. The air of mystery, romance, and sanctity which surround the convent life was not then probably so powerful as now. Then, the nuns lived more openly, and were a part of the everyday life of society. But to Yolande, with her strong love of life, its amusements, its follies, and its excitement, it seemed like being confronted with death to look at that pale face, downcast eyes, and shrouded figure. THE NUN OFFERED THE WINE TO YOLANDE. THE NUN OFFERED THE WINE TO YOLANDE. The nun\u0027s face was strikingly beautiful. Her features were very straight, with splendid eyebrows, and a sweet mouth, whose full lips were rendered almost more attractive by the little droop at each corner producing a soft dimple in the rounded cheek. The long lashes lay like a fringe over her magnificent dark hazel eyes, and as she stood, quite impassive and expressionless, only deadly pale, Yolande felt drawn towards her as she had never felt drawn to any woman before. The Captain of the Wight kept his eyes fixed on the sweet face. \"Pious lady,\" he said, \"we are greatly indebted to thee for thy hospitable courtesy. Hast thou been in these parts long?\" Obliged to answer, the nun, still keeping her eyes, however, steadily on the ground, said, in a low, deep melodious voice,-- \"Noble sir, Sister Ursula and I came hither but three months since.\" \"Holy saints!\" muttered the Captain, \"\u0027tis her very voice!\" Then, after a pause, he said,-- \"Thou art happy and peaceful here? There is naught that frights or disturbs you?\" A little flicker passed over the statue-like features. A slight tremor of the mouth, and a quiver of the eyelids, showed the nun was suffering from some not quite controlled emotion. Bending her head a little down, and keeping her eyes more than ever on the ground, she said, in her bell-like voice,-- \"Noble sir, there is naught that frights us.\" \"And this girl, who is she?\" asked the Captain. \"\u0027Tis a child which hath been brought hither for our Prioress to tend.\" \"Hath she no relatives here?\" \"Nay, I know not; but she is well with us,\" said the nun, looking at the child with affection. It was the first expression of softer feeling that had yet come into her face. The child returned her look with love and bright confidence. \"Thou art happy here?\" said Yolande. \"Ay, truly am I,\" replied the girl; \"now I know father will be safe.\" \"And who is thy father, sweet child?\" \"He is a noble knight, but I may not tell his name,\" said the girl. \"Dost thou know, holy sister?\" said Yolande, unable to repress her natural curiosity. The nun looked a trifle surprised, as if not expecting such a breach of manners in so high-born a damsel, but she replied, as coldly as ever,-- \"Nay, I know naught that passeth in the world. None who enter here have name, or kin on earth.\" Yolande shivered. It seemed like talking to a ghost. As her thirst was now assuaged, and none of the others would take any more--although Lord Woodville took an apple from the pretty child, and in doing so availed himself of the opportunity of slipping a gold coin on to the dish, the nun withdrew as silently as she came, and the girl accompanied her, giving another nod of friendly farewell to Ralph. \"\u0027Tis getting late, Lord Woodville, and I must be riding home,\" said Yolande. \"Where my father hath gotten to, I know not; and as for my poor Breton, good lack!\" and she broke into a merry laugh. They rode away from the peaceful vale, the long shadows of evening falling across the plain, and the chill mist of the marshland rising in white film around. They were a silent party. Lord Woodville was plunged in deep reverie. Yolande could not strike any sparks of wit out of Ralph, who worshipped her far too seriously to be quite at home and at his ease, and took in serious dudgeon the playful raillery with which his cousin treated him on the subject of the dark-eyed damsel. \"You silly boy, you think you are fond of me; but when you reach the age of manhood, and are of an age to marry, the lady of your choice will be one who is now a girl of just that little one\u0027s age. You mark my words.\" \"And what do you call the right age to marry?\" asked the crestfallen Ralph. \"Oh, not before you are thirty or forty, or fifty or sixty. There! I\u0027ll marry you when I am sixty. So now go and be happy, and grow as fast as you can; in wisdom, at least, for your body is big enough, good lack!\" As they rode back into the more cultivated land they met parties of two or three of the expedition returning from the chase; and as they passed Arreton Church they fell in with Sir William Lisle, who had been looking for his daughter, accompanied by Sir Amand de la Roche Guemené, who was mounted on a fresh horse. \"Marry, Sir Amand, where\u0027s thy horse?\" laughed Yolande. \"Pardie, mademoiselle, zat I cannot tell. I left \u0027im in ze vase.\"[*] [*] \"Vase,\" Anglicé \"mud.\" \"What vase?\" said the astonished Yolande. \"It must be a mighty big one if it can hold a horse.\" \"Foi de mon ordre! no; it would sallow \u0027im as easy as anyzing, and me too, \u0027ad I been ze fool to stop on \u0027im.\" \"Good lack! a vase swallow a horse and man? The poor man\u0027s lost his wits!\" cried Yolande, while Ralph looked very much astonished, and began to laugh. \"Vat you go for to laugh, young man?\" said the disconcerted and puzzled Breton. \"Is zere anyzing drole in ze vase svalloving a man?\" \"Why, beshrew me, there is!\" said old Sir William Lisle. \"Thou hast got hold of the wrong word; \u0027tis mud thou meanest, not a vase. Good lack! good lack! how these munseers do show their ignorance.\" As Yolande and her father were not going back to Carisbrooke Castle, they took leave of their noble host, and rode away across the downs to Briddlesford, which lay at the head of the long winding creek which flowed in from the Solent, while the others pursued their way back to the castle. The Captain of the Wight seemed plunged into a deeper reverie than ever, and scarcely spoke one word the whole way back. Ralph\u0027s mind was full of the tournament, and of the Abbot\u0027s promise to let him have money enough to equip himself as became an aspirant to chivalry. As soon as he had an opportunity, he took Maurice Woodville and Dicky Cheke aside and told them of his good fortune. \"My faith, Lisle, you are in luck. How much will he give you?\" \"I don\u0027t know; but he said he would tell old Langstoke to let me have what I wanted.\" \"Well, an I were you, I\u0027d strike while the iron is hot. I should get leave from old Jack-in-Harness to go down to-night, and lose no time. There\u0027s only six days before the Feast of St Michael,\" said Maurice Woodville. \"Ay, so should I,\" said Dicky Cheke. \"And, I say, Lisle, ask him to let us go too. We can help you; you\u0027re such a simpleton, any chapman can cheat you. You big fellows always are stupid and easily overreached.\" Giving Dicky Cheke a tweak of the nose, which caused that young gentleman to rush after him as he left the room, and kick violently against the door, which Ralph prudently shut, with happy promptitude, behind him, Master Lisle went off to look for Sir John Trenchard. He tapped at the door of the knight\u0027s apartments, and hearing a voice say \"Come in,\" he opened the door, and found Bowerman reclining on a couch, his head bandaged and his eyes closed. He was alone. \"Who\u0027s that?\" said the wounded page. \"Oh, Bowerman, I am grievous sad to see you look in such parlous case,\" said Ralph, his conscience pricking him for not having inquired after, or been to see, his wounded comrade before. At the sound of Ralph\u0027s voice, Bowerman\u0027s face flushed up; and in a voice whose tones expressed concentrated hate, he said,-- \"You fiend you! who asked you to come here?\" \"Well, Bowerman, I don\u0027t see why you should bear me such ill-will. \u0027Twas not my fault you met with your mishap.\" \"Yes, it was. If you had not aimed at the beaver,[*] which you know well enough is the weakest part of the whole armour, I should not have got that splinter in my cheek.\" [*] The visor. \"But,\" said Ralph, taken aback by this novel ground of accusation, \"you could have aimed at mine; and, besides, the beaver would never have come open, had it been tightly clasped.\" \"That\u0027s all as may be! but I knew you had never done anything of the kind before, so I hit you where there was least danger; and in return for my good nature, you took a cowardly advantage of me.\" Ralph coloured up. \"Bowerman, I have told you I am grieved you are hurt--if I could do anything to help you, I would; but, because you are wounded, you have no right to say such unjust and untrue things.\" \"There, that\u0027s just like your mean, lily-livered nature. Here I lie, unable to get up and punish you, all through your own base fault, and then you come in when no one is here, and tell me I tell lies!\" Ralph felt his temper rising, but he kept as calm as he could. \"You know, Bowerman, you are not just. But as you are suffering, I will not get angry. I can do nothing for you, then?\" \"Ay, marry can you, and that speedily--get out of this room!\" At this moment Lady Trenchard entered. \"Ah, Master Lisle, that is right courteous of you, and as one of gentle birth should do, to come and visit your discomfited comrade. I marvelled you had not come afore. But I heard you were out with the Lord Captain, and so I told Master Bowerman.\" Ralph felt a little uncomfortable. He did not deserve these excuses, for he had forgotten all about Bowerman. Lady Trenchard went on. \"Tell us now what sport you had. \u0027Twill cheer us up, and be as good as a tale for your comrade. \u0027Twill be kind in him, will it not, Master Bowerman?\" But the wounded page only tossed on his couch and uttered a sound, half groan, half smothered exclamation of furious rage. \"Ah, poor lad! he suffers much. I fear me these are febrile signs. \u0027Twill be well to have the worthy and pious Sir Simon Halbard to bleed him. He is something of a leech, and was infirmarer once, I heard, at Quarr Abbey; but thy tale will solace him, and take away his thoughts from the pain of the wound.\" Ralph longed to get away, but he was too polite to refuse to do what Lady Trenchard asked him. He began--determining to make the narrative as brief as possible--to tell the chief events of the afternoon. As he told of the Breton knight being stuck in the mud, a grunt of satisfaction proceeded from Bowerman. \"Ah! thou seest, Master Lisle. I told thee thy tale would solace him, and help to drive away his pain,\" said Lady Trenchard complacently. When Ralph came to the nuns, and told how they had so willingly brought refreshment for Yolande, of whom, by the way, he scarcely spoke at all, Lady Trenchard remarked,-- \"Ah, the Lady Abbess of Saint Clare, without Aldgate, wrote to me to go over and see the two new sisters who have come down of late. I am glad thou hast reminded me of this, fair page. There is one in whom she taketh much concern, as fearing for her health. She hath had trials in the world, and hath not yet gotten cured of them. And so thou rodest all day with the fair Mistress Yolande?\" added the grave and erect Lady Trenchard, with a penetrating glance. Ralph grew very red. \"Yea, my lady--that is, nay. She rode with my Lord Captain, and I waited on him, as was my duty.\" \"Ay, and so she rode with the Captain? Like enough, like enough!\" Then, after a pause she added, as if in a soliloquy, \"Ah well, she won\u0027t make much of him, poor lass. His heart\u0027s been broke these twelve years or more. \u0027Tis a sad story, and not one you lads would care to hear.\" \"Yes, I should, Dame Trenchard,\" said Bowerman shortly, while Ralph looked up surprised. It had never crossed his mind that so exalted a person, and so rigid as the Captain of the Wight, could possibly have a weakness or a romance. \"Nay, nay,\" said Lady Trenchard, sorry she had aroused their curiosity, \"\u0027tis a long and sad story, and not one that will give you joy. Besides, \u0027twas a kinsman of Master Lisle who married the fair girl, sore against her will; but her own true knight was away, and her father\u0027s and the king\u0027s will had to be obeyed, and so she was wed. But not for long--she soon died, they said; but who knows? \u0027Twas a sad story.\" And Lady Trenchard nodded her head gravely, then shook it sadly, as if she saw some sad mistake occurring, and lapsed into silence. \"But what of the Captain of the Wight, Dame Trenchard?\" said Bowerman. \"What hath he to do in all this?\" \"The Captain of the Wight! what of him?\" said Lady Trenchard absently. Her thoughts had gone off to the shortcomings of her maids, and whether Dame Joanna Bowerman would not have looked better in a black cote hardie, and lemon-coloured taffeta kirtle, than the yellow one which she wore, with a bright blue bodice. \"Not but what she tireth herself well, does Joanna Bowerman. I mind her when she was little Joanna Roucley. She always did have a liking for smart things, and she\u0027s a woman that bears them well--I will say that for her. But she lacked skill in colour.\" \"But what of the Captain?\" persisted Bowerman. \"Well! what of the Captain?\" said Lady Trenchard, with some slight asperity. \"I know naught of the Captain. He hath come back, I trow?\" \"Yea, but you were telling me of some love affair of his.\" \"Marry, was I? not that I know of. You sleep now, Master Bowerman; \u0027twill be best for you,\" said Lady Trenchard decisively. Eustace Bowerman muttered something that sounded very like \"old hag,\" and \"obstinate old harridan,\" which was quite unheeded by Lady Trenchard; and Ralph took the opportunity to slip out of the room.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1700/50058.html","bookId":1153,"book":{"id":1153,"title":"The Captain of the Wight","description":"简介： Among the many aspects in which it is possible to regard this important epoch, that of its influence on chivalry is one of the most interesting.
