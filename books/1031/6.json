{"id":11560,"no":6,"title":"CHAPTER V.","content":"THE YEAR GARGANTUA HAD WOODEN HORSES, AND WHAT USE HE MADE OF THEM. Engraving GARGANTUA AT PLAY. From the time he was three years old to the time he had grown to be a boy of five, Gargantua was brought up, by the strict command of his father, just like all the other children of the Kingdom. His education was very simple. It was: Drinking, eating, and sleeping; Eating, sleeping, and drinking; Sleeping, drinking, and eating. If he loved any one thing more than to play in the mud, that was to roll and wallow about in the mire. He would go home with his shoes all run down at the heels, and his face and clothes well streaked with dirt. Gargantua, therefore, was not more favored than the other little boys of the kingdom who were not so rich as he was; but there was one advantage which he did have. From his earliest babyhood he saw so many horses in the Royal Stables that he got to know a fine horse almost as well as his father did. Whenever he saw a horse he would clap his fat hands together, and shout at the top of his lungs. It was thought that—being a Prince who was, in time, to become a King—he should be taught to ride well. So they made him, when he was a little fellow of four years, so fine, so strong, and so wonderful a wooden horse that there had never been seen its like up to that date, and there never has been found in any young prince\u0027s play-house or toy-shop since. Engraving GARGANTUA\u0027S HORSE. This surprising horse must have been a piece of rare workmanship, because, whenever its young master wanted it to do anything, it was bound to do it. He could make it leap forward, jump backward, rear skyward, and waltz, all at one time. He could make it trot, gallop, rack, pace, gambol, and amble, just as the humor took him. But this was only half of what that horse could do. Gargantua, at a word, could make it change the color of its hair. One day its hide would be milk-white; the next day, bay; the next, black; the next, sorrel; the next, dapple-gray; the next, mouse-color; the next, piebald; the next, a soft brown deer-color. But this was not all. Gargantua learned to be so skilful that he thought that he might just as well make a horse to suit himself as to have a horse bought for him. So he sat knitting his great eyebrows till he finally found how he could make a hunting-nag out of a big post; one for every day, out of the beam of a wine-press; one with housings for his room, out of a great oak-tree; and, out of different kinds of wood in his father\u0027s kingdom, he made ten or twelve spare horses, and had seven for the mail. Engraving GARGANTUA\u0027S RIDING LESSONS. It was a rare sight to see all these wooden horses—bigger toys than had ever been made before—lying piled up, side by side, near Gargantua\u0027s bed, and the young Giant sleeping in their midst. One day, Gargantua had a fine chance for having some sport of his own making. It was on the day a noble lord came on a visit to his old friend, King Grandgousier. The Royal Stables proved rather small for such a number of horses as came with the noble lord. The Chief Equerry of the Lord of Breadinbag—which was the name of the great nobleman—was bothered out of his head because he could not find stable-room for all the horses brought with them. By good luck he and the Grand Steward happened to meet Gargantua at the foot of the great staircase. Engraving A NOBLE LORD CAME ON A VISIT. \"Hello, youngster, what is thy name?\" \"Prince Gargantua.\" \"Is that so?\" they cried. \"Then say, little Giant, tell us where we are to put our horses. The stables of thy Royal Father are all full.\" \"Yes, I know they are,\" said Gargantua, slily; \"all you have to do is to follow me, and I will show you a beautiful stable, where there are bigger horses than ever yours can grow to be. Where have you left your horses?\" \"Out in the court-yard, little Giant.\" \"Follow me, then, and I will show you the stables.\" The Chief Equerry and the Grand Steward went after him, up the great staircase of the palace, through the second hall, into a great stone gallery, by which they entered into a huge stone tower, the steps to which they mounted, along with the Prince, but breathing very heavily indeed. \"I am afraid that big child is laughing at us,\" whispered the Grand Steward, behind his hand, to the Chief Equerry. \"Nobody ever puts a stable at the top of a house.\" \"You are wrong there,\" whispered back the Chief Equerry; \"because I happen to know of places, in Lyons and elsewhere, where there are stables in the attic. But, to make sure, let us ask him again.\" Turning to Gargantua, he said:— \"My little Prince, art thou sure thou art taking us right?\" \"Haven\u0027t I already told you? Isn\u0027t this my father\u0027s palace, and don\u0027t I know the way to the stables of my big horses? Don\u0027t gasp so much, gentlemen. Only three little steps and we are there!\" Engraving \"ONLY THREE LITTLE STEPS.\" Once up the steps, which made the Chief Equerry and the Grand Steward blow worse than ever, and passing through another great hall, the mischievous Prince, opening wide a door,—that of his own room,—cried, triumphantly:— \"Here are the finest horses, gentlemen, in the world. This one next the door is my favorite riding-horse. That one near the fireplace is my pacer,—a good one, I assure you. Now, just look at that one leaning against yonder window. I rode it rather hard yesterday, and it is tired. That\u0027s my hunting-nag. I had it at a great price from Frankfort; but I am willing to make you a present of it. Don\u0027t refuse me, I beg. Once on it, you can bag all the partridges and hares you may come across for the whole winter. Now, choose; which of you will ride my hunting-nag?\" The Chief Equerry and the Grand Steward, knowing that all these fine names of \"riding-horse,\" and \"pacer,\" and \"hunting-nag,\" were for mere blocks of wood, were, for a moment, stupefied. They looked at each other slily, and half ashamed; but the joke was too good when they thought of the long stairs they had toiled up, and of their horses below waiting all this time to be stabled and fed. They couldn\u0027t help it; it was too rich; so they laughed till they were tired, and then began to laugh again till they were tired again. \"A rare bird is this young scamp,\" panted the Chief Equerry, as he lifted one end of the great beam which Gargantua called his hunting-nag. \"A prime joker is this young rogue, if he is a Prince,\" panted the Grand Steward, in echo, as he stumbled along with the other end into the hall. There was no use in being mad at the trick young Gargantua had played on them. So they left him stroking the fastest horses in the world, while they went laughing all the way across the first hall, down the small steps, across the other halls, along the corridors, past the stone gallery, down the long stairway as far as the great arch, where they let the famous hunting-nag roll to the bottom. When they at last reached the great dining-room, where all their friends were gathered, they made everybody laugh like a swarm of flies at the trick played on them by the little Prince with his wooden horses.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3043/84063.html","bookId":1031,"book":{"id":1031,"title":"Three Good Giants","description":"简介： Long before the day when Fielding and Smollett began to be read on the sly, and before the comic Muse of Congreve and Wycherly began to be looked at askance, that English moral sentiment, over which Macaulay was to philosophize more than a century la...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3043","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:12 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:12 AM"}}
