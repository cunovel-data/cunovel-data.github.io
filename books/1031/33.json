{"id":11587,"no":33,"title":"CHAPTER XXXII.","content":"THE WONDERFUL WAY IN WHICH PANTAGRUEL DISPOSED OF THE GIANT LOUPGAROU AND HIS TWO HUNDRED AND NINETY-NINE GIANTS. As soon as the body-guard of Giants saw flames bursting from the tents, all they could think of doing was to snatch up their little King Anarchus, tie him to the neck of one of them, and get out of the burning city as fast as their long legs could take them. Panurge, as usual, was the first to see the Giants racing out of the city. \"My lord,\" he said, \"just look at those big rogues over there! All you have to do is to charge with that mast you have in your hand. You can have no better way to prove your skill. We, on our part, are not going to fail you.\" \"Ho! ho!\" answered Pantagruel, \"I do not lack courage. But even Hercules did not dare fight against two, and here thou wouldst have me fight against three hundred!\" \"What!\" retorted Panurge, while his tip-tilted nose curled higher in the air than usual, \"does Your Highness seriously mean to compare yourself with Hercules? God has given you stronger teeth and stouter limbs than ever Hercules had.\" Panurge was going to say a good deal more, but here came Loupgarou with all his Giants. When Loupgarou saw that Pantagruel was alone,—for, after all, to the eyes of giants common-sized men, like Panurge, Epistemon, Carpalim, and Eusthenes, must have looked like so many dwarfs,—he felt sure that he would be able to make away with him. In fact, he was so sure that he turned to his Giants, laughing all the time so as to show all his big, cruel, yellow teeth. \"By Mahomet! if any of you dare fight with that great braggart over there, you shall die at these hands! I, alone, wish to fight with him! Meanwhile, you shall have rare sport in looking on.\" Laughing loudly, the other Giants fell back a short distance, where the wine and victuals had been left, carrying their little King along with them. They had hardly got there when the cunning Panurge and his friends, putting on a most humble, miserable look, crawled up, saying:— \"We surrender, good comrades. We have no taste for war. All we ask is to join with you in feasting while our masters are fighting.\" The poor little King was willing; the Giants were willing; and so they began to feast, Panurge and the others along with them. Loupgarou had, by this time, advanced upon Pantagruel, with a fearful mace of steel, weighing nine hundred and seventy thousand pounds. At the end of the mace there were thirteen diamond points, the very smallest of which was as big as the largest bell of the N?tre Dame, in Paris. But what made that mace so terrible was, that it was formed of fairy steel, so that it had only to touch the strongest thing in the world to break it into pieces. But Pantagruel, as we know, put his faith in God alone. As every good Christian, when he sees a fearful enemy near him, calls upon God, so Pantagruel prayed to Him, while Loupgarou was cursing furiously, to aid him who had always loved the Church and obeyed the Ten Commandments. He had scarcely ended his prayer when he heard a voice from the sky, saying: \"Have faith, and thou shall gain the victory.\" By this time, Loupgarou, with his mouth wide open, was drawing near him, and Pantagruel, who had no enchanted weapon, but only his mast, thought to frighten the monster by crying out, as the old Laced?monians used to do, in his most awful tones: \"Thou diest, rascal! Thou diest!\" Even while he was saying this, he was digging his big hands into the ship which he carried at his waist, from which he took more than eighteen kegs and four bushels of salt, which he threw, filling Loupgarou\u0027s mouth, throat, nose, and eyes. This only made Loupgarou rage worse than ever. Roaring with pain and anger, he rushed against Pantagruel, thinking to break his skull with his fairy mace. Pantagruel, luckily, was both quick of foot and keen of eye. Seeing what Loupgarou was at, he stepped with his left foot back one pace; but even then he was not so quick as to save the ship. Loupgarou\u0027s blow fell upon its prow, which was enough to smash it into four thousand and eighty-six pieces, scattering, of course, the rest of the salt along the ground. Engraving THE FIGHT WITH LOUPGAROU. When Pantagruel saw his good ship all in pieces he did not despair, but gallantly attacked Loupgarou with its mast, striking him two blows; one fell above the breast, the other between neck and shoulders. The monster did not relish such treatment. So, when Pantagruel wanted to give another blow in the same sharp style, Loupgarou raised his enchanted mace and rushed upon him, knowing that he had only to touch him with it to cleave him from head to foot. But, by God\u0027s blessing, Pantagruel\u0027s nimbleness saved him here a second time. Stepping briskly to one side, the terrible mace swept with a hissing noise through the air, striking a great rock which stood in the way, into which it crashed more than seventy-three feet, making a fire greater in bulk than nine thousand and six tons flash from the hole it had made. Here was another chance for Pantagruel. Seeing that Loupgarou was tugging away at his enchanted mace to pull it from the rock, Pantagruel ran towards him with his mast well-poised, feeling sure that, this time, he would take off his head; but, by bad luck, his mast just grazed the stock of Loupgarou\u0027s mace. Of course it broke, and, what is worse, broke within three hand-breadths of his own hand. Pantagruel was so much amazed at all this, as he had never before heard that Loupgarou\u0027s mace was enchanted, that he cried out, without very well knowing what he was doing: \"Ho! Panurge, where art thou?\" Panurge, whose eyes and cars had been stretched wide open ever since the beginning of the fight, shouted out to the King and the Giants: \"By Heaven! if we don\u0027t get them apart, they will hurt one another.\" But the Giants, on their side, were in high chuckles. When Carpalim wanted to get up to help his master, one of them said:— \"By Golfarim!\"—who is the nephew of Mahomet,—\"if thou stir from here, I shall tuck thee in my belt.\" Meanwhile Pantagruel, having lost his staff, caught hold of the little stump that was left of the mast, striking blows, here and there, with it on the Giant\u0027s body. But the stump was so short that no harm was done. Of course, all this time, Loupgarou was puffing and blowing hard to pull his mace out from the rock. He at last succeeded. All the time he was getting ready to swing it once more, he was bawling out: \"Villain! this time I shall surely kill thee! Never after this shalt thou make honest people thirsty!\" In trying to get his mace in proper position to strike, he was, of course, bending a little. Here was one more chance for Pantagruel; and Pantagruel took it. While Loupgarou had his body half-bent, Pantagruel gave him such a kick in the stomach that he made him fall backwards, heels over head, and as he began to drag him along the ground, Loupgarou was bleeding at the throat, and could only find breath to call out three times: \"Mahomet! Mahomet!! Mahomet!!!\" Plate DEATH OF LOUPGAROU. The moment they heard that cry, up started all the Giants to help their leader; but now came Panurge\u0027s time to interfere. \"Gentlemen, don\u0027t you go, if you have the slightest faith in me. My master is mad, and is striking out blindly. He may hurt you in his anger.\" But the Giants only ha-ha\u0027d at all this, having seen that poor Pantagruel\u0027s only weapon, the mast, had been shivered to the handle by the fairy mace. So, like idiots, they started in a body to Loupgarou\u0027s rescue. The moment Pantagruel, who was just then breathing a little hard, saw the Giants coming up, he caught Loupgarou\u0027s body, encased in an armor of stout anvils, up by the two feet, lifting it high in the air with the same ease as he might have raised a pike; and, with the master\u0027s own body, he slashed around right and left among the Giants, knocking them down as a mason chips with his hammer little bits off a stone. Not one of the Giants could stand before Pantagruel without being struck flat to the ground. While Pantagruel was performing such wonders with Loupgarou\u0027s body and his armor of anvils, Panurge, together with Carpalim and Eusthenes, were not idle. They, who had been so humble a few moments before, were now going from one to the other of the party who lay stretched on the ground, cutting the throats of such as had not fallen quite dead. When the battle seemed to be at an end, up came a fearful Giant, whom Pantagruel did not know, but who was so much taller and stouter than his comrades that Loupgarou had made him his first officer. Pantagruel felt perfectly safe with his new weapon; but, seeing how big the Giant was, he gave an extra strong blow with the body, which sent Loupgarou\u0027s head rolling on the ground. This new Giant was the last, and that one strong blow killed him. Then Pantagruel, seeing that none of the Giants had escaped, with one great swing of the arm, threw the headless body into the city, which was not very far off. It fell into the great Square, where it crushed with its weight one singed cat, one wet cat, one lame duck, and one bridled goose. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3043/84090.html","bookId":1031,"book":{"id":1031,"title":"Three Good Giants","description":"简介： Long before the day when Fielding and Smollett began to be read on the sly, and before the comic Muse of Congreve and Wycherly began to be looked at askance, that English moral sentiment, over which Macaulay was to philosophize more than a century la...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3043","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:12 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:12 AM"}}
