When Gargantua, after the battle, made his triumphant entrance into the city, it was easy enough for him to find the Palace where Picrochole had stopped, but not quite so easy to get hold of the King himself. And when he reached the Palace, he heard that those wicked advisers and councillors of Picrochole, who had done their best to keep mischief alive,—Swashbuckler, Durtaille, and Smaltrash,—had all managed to escape helter-skelter from the city, just six hours before the battle. Gargantua\u0027s first duty was to order a muster of his troops, by which he learned, much to his satisfaction, that they had not suffered greatly in the battle, the four soldiers who had been killed happening to belong to the band of one of his officers, Captain Tolmere. He had the pleasure of shaking his old master Ponocrates by the hand on his lucky escape in having his doublet, instead of his portly body, jagged by an archer\u0027s bolt. It was a mild shake, for a hearty one would have made a jelly of it. The Chief Treasurer was ordered to see that all his brave followers should be feasted, each with his troop, at the Prince\u0027s expense. He directed, moreover, that, after the feast, the army should assemble in the great Square before the Palace, and receive a full six months\u0027 pay on the spot. This being joyfully done, the next order was for the assembling of all that remained of Picrochole\u0027s party. All his princes and captains being present, Gargantua made a speech, which was as full of wisdom as it was rich in praise of his good old father, King Grandgousier. He concluded with these words, spoken in a stern voice:— \"I impose on those who have wickedly attacked us but one condition. They must deliver into my hands that knave Marquet, who was the groundwork of this most unjust war.\" Engraving GARGANTUA\u0027S CAPTIVES. Marquet, who had been a great man all during the war, and who had strutted around, crowing and looking wise, and had been consulted, and patted on the back, and stroked on the head, ever since his fight with Forgier, had been silly enough, instead of running away as fast as his legs could take him, to go to the assembly to hear what the Prince had to say. The moment Gargantua mentioned his name, quiet, well-to-do neighbors, who had all along been vexed at the airs he had put on,—being on every side of him,—pointed him out with their fingers, slily, wickedly whispering, \"You want Marquet,—there he is, that man over there!\" The wretch was at once seized by a dozen strong and willing hands, and hauled and hustled about, till, at last, he stood, breathing hard, before Gargantua. The Giant, towering above him,—there was no chair in the Palace large enough for him to sit comfortably in,—looked at him for a moment with scorn. \"So it is thou who art Marquet, art thou?\" \"Yes, may it please Your Most Gracious, Most Merciful Highness,\" gasped Marquet, stuttering horribly, and turning very pale. \"Gymnaste,\" said Gargantua, \"I make thee responsible for this wretch, and his safe delivery to our Headsman for immediate execution.\" Gymnaste, after bowing respectfully, collared Marquet and marched him off. After the rogue had been borne away to the block, Gargantua ordered that all who had been killed should be honorably buried in the Black Soil Valley. For the wounded, he made ample provision in his Royal Hospital. To the survivors, he did no other hurt than to put them to work on the printing-presses which he had lately set up. When leaving, he graciously thanked his weather-beaten, if not war-beaten, veterans, and sent them to winter-quarters with rich gifts for each one; for, even though Picrochole had run away, there was no telling but what the Bunmakers might make another fight, and so it was thought wiser to keep the army together for a while. But to this rule he made special exception of those of his legions who had had the good luck, during the pursuit, of doing some gallant deed. There were a good many of those brave soldiers who had marched, rank upon rank, after the staff of the Giant himself, and had done some brave action upon Picrochole\u0027s men, while their master\u0027s great Mare was switching her terrible tail, and knocking men down with the right whisk and the left, and driving from the field all who were lucky enough to get out of her way. Engraving REWARDING THE ARMY. The Giant breathed a rumbling sigh of relief at getting through so much hard work. \"I start for home at daybreak,\" he said. \"Let my staff and these brave men, worthy of laurels, follow me.\" The distance between Roche-Clermaud and the Palace of his father was not so very great; so that, leaving at daybreak the next day, Gargantua, with his staff and a long line of the brave officers and soldiers who had done such good service, following, reached the Palace very leisurely by sundown. It was a joyful day when Father Grandgousier, who, since Gargantua had left, seated so grandly on his great Mare, had been all the time praying for his safety, was told by the sentinels at the gate that the Prince, with a large retinue, was coming near. The old man at once hastened, in high glee, as fast as his gouty feet could carry him, to the court-yard, so as to be ready to receive his son. The moment Gargantua rode in through the gateway, Grandgousier shouted out:— \"Ho! ho! ho! ho! So thou art there, my boy! Come quickly to thy Father\u0027s arms!\" Even while he was saying these words he was whispering aside to Snapsauce, the Very Fattest of the three Very Fat Cooks:— \"Get up, thou rogue, within two hours, the finest supper that has ever gone down mortal throats since the days of my cousin King Ahasuerus! My boy has come back a conqueror!\" Gargantua had already leaped down from his Mare and had rushed towards his father. It was truly a meeting of Giants, which the little men around could only manage to see by craning their necks in the air. After embracing, Grandgousier and Gargantua passed up the broad stone stairs which led to the main hall. They had not long to wait upon the three Very Fat Cooks, who, by the way, had sent out messengers miles and miles along the road by which their young master was to come, and had known half a day before Father Grandgousier himself did, the very hour when the Prince would reach the Palace. Cunning Very Fat Cooks!—they had only to send up the finest supper that had ever been seen since the days of King Ahasuerus, which had been all ready to be served long before the King had even thought of ordering it. Everybody was in good humor, none more so than the jovial old King himself. When the huge table was cleared of all its rich viands and its sparkling wines, and the guests were about leaving the hall, Grandgousier distributed to each of the deserving soldiers the ornaments on the sideboard, which, in the mass, weighed eight hundred thousand and fourteen golden besants worth in great antique vases, rich pots, basins, superb cups, goblets, candlesticks, comfit-boxes, and other such golden plate. In addition to this princely gift, Grandgousier caused to be counted out from the Royal Coffers, to each hero, twelve hundred thousand golden crowns; and, as a further mark of his special favor, he directed that to such as he named should be granted, in perpetuity for themselves and their heirs, if they should happen to have any, certain castles and neighboring lands. To Master Ponocrates, he gave Roche-Clermaud. To Gymnaste, Le Coudray. To Eudemon, Montpensier. And so on with the favorites. \"Ho! ho! my boy!\" suddenly cried Father Grandgousier, tapping his big forehead with his mighty finger. \"We have forgotten some one, and him our bravest, too!\" \"Whom?\" \"Why, our gallant Friar.\" \"Oh! as for Friar John, trust him to me, Father. I shall take care of him!\" \"What wilt thou do, my boy?\" \"What will I do? Why, I shall build for him a Monastery a hundred times more magnificent than those Convents at Bonnivet, Chambourg, and Chantilly, that are the boast of the world. Our Friar shall be the Abbot of Theleme and he will make a famous Abbot, too!\" Engraving THE WONDERFUL WINDING STAIRWAY. And so Gargantua built for his friend Friar John a Monastery greater than the Convent at Bonnivet, and the Convent at Chambourg, and the Convent at Chantilly; for his had nine thousand, three hundred and thirty-two chambers. But its greatest beauty, after all, was a wonderful winding stairway, up which six men-at-arms might ride abreast, with their six lances at rest, to the very top of the Abbey. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3043/84079.html","bookId":1031,"book":{"id":1031,"title":"Three Good Giants","description":"简介： Long before the day when Fielding and Smollett began to be read on the sly, and before the comic Muse of Congreve and Wycherly began to be looked at askance, that English moral sentiment, over which Macaulay was to philosophize more than a century la...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3043","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:12 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:12 AM"}}
