It was, of course, at this same supper, of which the three Very Fat Cooks were so proud, that the old King, as soon as ever the company were seated, started to give the whole story of the wicked war which Picrochole had made on him. When he came to that part of his story, in which he had to speak of the wonderful things Friar John had done in the Abbey vineyard, nothing would do but that the brave monk should be invited to the Palace to receive the thanks of the whole joyous party. Gargantua sent post-haste for Friar John. In a little while—for the Abbey was not very far off—here came the good Friar on King Grandgousier\u0027s own mule, with his famous staff held firmly in his right hand. When he was once fairly in the dining-room, a thousand caresses and another thousand compliments greeted him. \"Welcome, Friar John! Thou comest in good time! Welcome, brave cousin!\" shouted Grandgousier. \"We have kept your seat for you, Friar John,\" roared both Grandgousier and Gargantua in a sort of giant concert. And so, at last, seated on the right hand of Grandgousier, the Friar was prevailed on to tell, in his own way, the story of his great fight for the Abbey. Nothing would do them but that everybody should jump up to see and feel for himself the glorious staff, with which so many valiant deeds had been done. Then the staff was reverently placed in a corner of the room. Engraving FRIAR JOHN ARRIVES. After supper, there was a long consultation about what ought to be done with Picrochole. As is always the way, one said one thing; another unsaid it; one had a plan; some one else had something better. It was finally resolved not to wait for another day, but to start the very next midnight, which—it being now two o\u0027clock in the afternoon—was only ten hours off. While some young men were sent out as spies to bring word what Picrochole was doing, the rest began to arm themselves with breast-plate and back-plate and all the iron and steel plates they could get hold of. There was a little trouble about what Friar John was to wear. They wanted to put their iron and steel stuff on him; but the brave monk wouldn\u0027t agree to it. He rushed to the corner where his staff was, grasped it with both hands, and waved it in the air, saying, \"Don\u0027t trouble yourselves about me, good friends. This is what I saved my Abbey with! I know it, and it knows me; it is good enough for me! I am heart and soul with you. All I ask for is a stout horse, and you will find me with my staff by your side whenever you want me.\" \"Very well, Friar,\" Gargantua said, laughing. \"Every conqueror has the right to choose his weapons. You are a conqueror; keep yours.\" When all the clocks were striking midnight, Gargantua left the Palace with Ponocrates, Friar John always carrying his staff, Gymnaste, Eudemon the page, and twenty-five of the most adventurous knights, all armed from head to foot, and mounted like great Saint George himself, each with a stout archer behind him. These were to be followed, the next morning, by the whole army, which had been recruited in a fashion that would look very strange to-day. Let me tell you how it all was! Before Gargantua had come back from Paris, and while Picrochole was still galloping with his wicked soldiers over rich fields, and trampling down fruits and vines, and cursing and cutting and slashing away, and killing just as the fancy took him, Father Grandgousier had sent messages to his friends and neighbors living a hundred miles around, telling them all about the war; how his son Gargantua, in whom he trusted, was far away in Paris, studying hard at his Latin; and asking them to help him just as much as they could in money and men. It was in this way that it was made as clear as the bright sun shining in heaven at noonday, how many friends the good old Giant really had. Some might say all this was because he was a Giant; but I think it was not so much that as because he had always, through a long life, been kind and gentle to little men. Taking what one Prince, and another, gave in money, Father Grandgousier raised among his neighbors one hundred and thirty-four million and two and a half crowns of pure gold. When he read their lists, giving the number of soldiers each one was able to lend him, he found that he would have:— 15,000 men at arms. 32,000 cavalrymen. 89,000 arquebusiers. 140,000 volunteers. That is to say, 276,000 stout soldiers, all well equipped and provisioned for six months and four days. To which were to be added:— 11,200 cannon. 47,000 double cannon, etc. The good old Giant felt very grateful; but he swore, nevertheless, a round oath that there was no need for him to accept so great an army. Where was he to put two hundred and seventy-six thousand soldiers? Where could he store away fifty-eight thousand cannon? If he could only be sure that his Gargantua would come home in time, why, he wouldn\u0027t care for any army at all! \"If my boy Gargantua should once get among that Picrochole gang, he would scatter them over the border quicker than they ever crossed it,\" he was saying to himself all the time. Meanwhile, that rogue Picrochole was going on at such a rate with his pastime of cursing, killing, cutting, and slashing at men, and ravaging vineyards, and burning houses, that Grandgousier found that he had really to do something that would strike terror. So he sent another Royal Messenger to his friends the Princes, telling them that he would be satisfied, for the present, with 2,500 men-at-arms. 66,000 infantry. 26,000 arquebusiers. 22,000 pioneers. 6,000 light cavalry. 122,500 men, all to be well equipped and provisioned by his friends, as promised. He added, in a postscript, that all else he needed would be two hundred pieces of heavy artillery.

But if he once gets home, I wouldn\u0027t give that\"—snapping his fat old fingers—\"for the whole Picrochole gang!\" For a wonder, the army got to the Palace a week before Gargantua reached it.
