{"id":21917,"no":19,"title":"Chapter 10","content":"So there it was, all finished, all done, and for the last time Lovat looked at it, saw the green mountains, the tumbling river, the white span of the bridge. But the bridge and he were finished now. His work was done. The little Latin-American official touched his elbow deferentially. \"Excellency, the train!\" \"Yes, the train,\" Lovat repeated mechanically. His companion looked at him with grave sympathy. Only three months ago Lovat was a young and happy bridegroom. To-day the builder was a grave gray-haired man. Yes, the bridge was done, Lovat knew.

Two brown shy little children were standing fearful of the bridge, and she knelt to them. \"Come, darlings,\" he could hear the deep remembered voice. She led them confidently across his bridge, and as she led them she smiled to him. Well, he must go. There was other work to be done, other bridges to build, until the time the Master of the Masons told him to rest. He must be about his work. \"All our life is work,\" he said to himself as he boarded the train. \"All our love is comradeship.\" Well, there was work to be done, and there was comradeship.
