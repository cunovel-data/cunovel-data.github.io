{"id":21953,"no":55,"title":"A QUATRAIN OF LING TAI FU\u0027S","content":"Because of his perfect, or nearly perfect, English there were many who believed that Li Sin was only masquerading as a Chinaman. Because of the slightly slit Mongol eyes, and the swarthy color of his skin, there were others who explained his enigma by guessing he was a half-breed. It never occurred to either party that Li Sin had been sent to Eton, in England, at the age of thirteen, and that from Eton he had gone to Oxford. They would not have believed it if you told them. There is a dogma abroad to the effect that every Chinaman must of necessity speak English like a Cantonese laundryman or like an attendant at a chop-suey restaurant. It never occurred to them, either, that Li Sin was a Manchu duke, with a genealogy that extended back to the days of Tang. It never occurred to them that the slant-eyed Manchu was as big a physician as any of the high-priced practitioners on the Avenue. To the descendants of fur-peddlers and deck-scrubbers who graced the Social Register, or to the millionaires of Long Island who had soared into the financial heavens on an accidental oil-spout or who had amassed their fortunes by the less reputable forms of mine-grabbing—to these, and to their wives and daughters, Li Sin was merely a tradesman or shopkeeper. It did not particularly matter to them that his shop on Fifth Avenue was filled with little gold Buddhas whose eyes were fine emeralds, with pieces of lacquer which it had taken an artist his lifetime to do, with peachblow vases transparent as a hand against the sun, with porcelains sheer as fine silks, with cloisonne jars that made staid experts rave like men in liquor. But the strictures of the ignorant did not worry Li Sin in the least. He would only raise his eyebrows and smile his bland, inscrutable smile. Li Sin has left Fifth Avenue now, and in his store, which was in those days a temple of truth as well as a temple of beauty, a very lying and exceedingly dishonest Armenian reigns. In his own city of Tientsin the Manchu lives in stately leisure. He has reverted to his own name, Hsien Po, which is great in Manchu annals. He has reverted to his Manchu dress of brocaded blouse and silken trousers, to his mandarin\u0027s cap with its mandarin\u0027s button. He is very proud of his pear gardens, and he divides his time between walking in them, reading the analects of Confucius, and giving the benefit of his marvelous medical knowledge gratuitously to the poor. He is happy, I hope, for if ever a man deserved to be happy, it is he. He is gone now, is Li Sin, but I can see him as plainly as though he were standing beside me. A rather squat sort of man, with a squarish face and high cheek-bones. His shining black hair was parted smoothly at the side, and there was a look of health in the transparent quality of his brown skin and in the whites of his slanting eyes. There was always a quiet smile on his lips, and he wore the tweed and broadcloth of America with as much ease as the blouse and silken trousers of his own land. The only Oriental hint in his clothes was the suppressed gorgeousness of his neckties. He roamed about the great store, passing an occasional word with the attendants or stopping to greet a favorite customer, which was an honor. The customers were much in awe of Li Sin. There were incidents that had taught them to respect him. There was the incident of the amateur pottery expert who happened to be also a millionaire. He noticed a vase of delicate blue jade. \"Oh, Li Sin,\" he said, \"I want that. That\u0027s a wonderful piece of Ming.\" \"It\u0027s not Ming,\" the Manchu told him. \"I tell you it is Ming!\" the young millionaire insisted. \"I \u0027ll buy it.\" \"I \u0027m afraid you won\u0027t, Mr. Rensselaer,\" the Manchu answered blandly. \"I won\u0027t sell it to you.\" \"Then you \u0027ll sell me nothing, ever again,\" Rensselaer decreed in a passion. \"Oh, very well,\" Li Sin smiled. To Morganstern, the munitions magnate, he was much shorter. The bulky financier rushed into the store rolling a cigar about his fat lips. He wanted a rug, he said, an expensive one, the best in the store. Li Sin smiled a trifle cynically and pointed out something on the wall. \"A Persian thirteenth-century,\" he explained curtly. \"Used to belong to a shah of Persia. It costs seventeen thousand dollars.\" \"I \u0027ll take it,\" Morganstern nodded. \"I want something for the bedroom floor.\" \"But, dear sir,\" Li Sin expostulated, \"one does n\u0027t put that on the floor. One hangs it on a wall.\" \"I don\u0027t care a damn.\" The munitions man drew out his check-book. \"Anything good enough for the shah of Persia\u0027s wall is good enough for my feet.\" \"My good sir—\" Li Sin\u0027s voice was as bland as ever—\"you are making a mistake. There are several grass-rug emporiums on Second Avenue. Go into the next drug store and look one up in a telephone-book. Take a trolley across Fifty-ninth Street. They \u0027ll sell you one, and you can carry it home beneath your arm.\" And abruptly he left Morganstern. These things created a legend about Li Sin that will never die on the Avenue. Cynics say that it was good advertising, and brought people who liked to be insulted. But we, who knew the Manchu, were certain that was the last thing he had in mind. Peculiar as Li Sin\u0027s business habits were, more peculiar still were his friends. Among them might be counted a European ambassador in Washington, a great heavy-weight wrestler, a little Roman Catholic priest, a head waiter in a restaurant. All of these people he liked for some quality that his shrewd eyes had discovered. And last but not least was Irene Johns. She had come into the store one soft spring morning, looking for a birthday present for her mother, something inexpensive, she said, about two dollars, all—she laughed merrily—she could afford. Perhaps it was that gurgling laugh of hers, that limpid, hurried, harmonious scale, that drew Li Sin\u0027s attention. But he came forward with a suggestion when she and the salesman became nonplused at the problem of finding something pretty, good and worth two dollars. \"Perhaps I can help,\" he smiled. She impressed him with her appearance as much as with her laugh. There was something so ethereal about her that she seemed less a being of flesh and blood than the disembodied spirit of spring. Her fair hair, her starlit purple eyes, her eager, half-closed small mouth with its glint of little teeth, her slim neck stood out against her heather costume and black, sweeping hat like a softly modulated light. She was so little, so slender, that she seemed as delicate as a snowflake. She moved with the lightness of a feather stirring along the ground. And yet, Li Sin saw with his physician\u0027s eye, she was not fragile. She was as healthy as an athlete. \"I think I can find you something,\" he said. He did. In the rear of the store he discovered a roughly hammered silver brooch from Bokhara, a marvel of intricacy and sweeping lines; he had bought it in Bokhara himself for two rubles. The thing had interested him. \"But this must be more than two dollars!\" She spoke in wonder. \"I paid one dollar for it in Bokhara, and I am exacting a dollar profit for it, which is not too little,\" the Manchu answered gravely. By what peculiar, invisible steps their friendship ripened it would be impossible to detail; but ripen it did. The fresh, fair American beauty, slim and beautiful as a Tanagra figurine, and the squat, middle-aged Mongol liked each other, came to appreciate each other. She had an inborn love for beautiful things, and he was never weary of showing her the treasures of his store. He showed her strange, exotic jewels, collected by dead kings and queens—chrysoberyls that were at times the strange green of olives and at other times red like a setting sun, topazes with the yellow of aged wine, sunstones that glowed with a tremulous golden red, carbuncles that flashed into explosive stars of scarlet, peridots and milky moonstones, a ruby that the King of Ceylon had owned, and an emerald that had once belonged to the unhappy Queen of Scots. Irene Johns would gasp at the sight of these things. \"They \u0027re so beautiful!\" she would say. \"They make the tears come to my eyes!\" That was enough for Li Sin, that gasp of appreciation. He loved the things so much himself. He had hunted his treasures up and down the earth and to and fro in it, and he wanted them to be gazed on with the appreciative eye rather than with the cold look of barter and exchange. He liked this little twenty-year-old woman, because she had the spirit of beauty within her, and because she seemed so fair and fresh and unprotected. And she liked the swarthy Mongol, not for his strange, exotic setting, but for the sheer kindliness of him, the great, expansive benevolence and his consummate courtesy, which after all was nothing but the birthright of a Manchu prince. There could be no question of love between them, for many reasons, and never a thought of it passed their minds. She might have been something like a niece to him, and he her benevolent uncle. They never met outside his store. He drew from her the story of what of life she had known, carefully, gently, like the skilled surgeon extracting a splinter from flesh. The daughter of a naval surgeon who had died while she was still young,—and who, Li Sin shrewdly guessed, had been somewhat of a blackguard,—she lived poorly with her mother, on a meager pension. She had been brought up decently, educated well, at what must have been a terrible expense to the mother. She had not been married, beautiful as she was, because she had not mixed with people who were to be regarded as beneath her in social rank. The people of her own station were too poor to marry offhand—but there was a young ensign she mentioned as having met once or twice, and there was a faint blush on her cheeks as she spoke of it. For the illustrious and the moneyed she had either too little fortune or too little lineage. And that was all. \"Too bad!\" Li Sin murmured to himself, and his thoughts would have done credit to the most adroit of schatchen. \"Too bad!\" She would breeze in, if such a word may be used of her who was as gentle as a zephyr, bringing always with her the sweetness of spring. \"Good morning!\" she would greet him eagerly. \"I wonder if we could find something—I want a clasp for my hair, for evening wear—something frightfully inexpensive.\" \"I think we might find it.\" Li Sin would smile, and he would find it. He took her money, and gave her the article at a just profit on what he had paid for it. The only thing gratuitous he gave her was the travel and the adventure necessary to pick his wonderful trifles up. Of this he said nothing, and she was none the wiser. There came the day when she entered a little excited, a little afraid, a little nervous. She wanted something more expensive than usual. She was going out that night, she explained, with somebody. \"I am going to be married soon,\" she blurted out. \"I am engaged.\" \"To whom?\" Li Sin asked quietly. \"A friend of my father\u0027s,\" she answered blushingly. \"Roderick Dreghorn, the ivory-hunter.\" \"I wonder if I might ask you to do something,\" Li Sin said slowly, \"and that is: will you bring your fiancé here some day so that I may congratulate him?\" \"I should love to,\" she said; and she left him, excitedly happy, Li Sin saw; but he also noticed that she seemed a little terrified, a little aghast. I have told the story of Li Sin to many people, now that he is gone to his own home and is happy there with his poor and his pear-trees, and some of them have believed me because they know China and the manner of man Li Sin is, and some of them have believed me because they know I abhor lies as I abhor the devil. But many cannot understand it. They cannot see why a Manchu duke should become a merchant on Fifth Avenue. \"And if he is as great a doctor as you say—\" they object. There is a passage in Isaiah, I believe, which speaks of Tyre, \"whose merchants are princes, whose traffickers are the honorable of the earth.\" Marco Polo, that ancient Venetian, says of Cathay, that there, of all professions the most esteemed is that of merchant. It is above arms, he says, above learning. And what obtained in the Yellow Empire when Hoang-ti led his people across the desert in the misty dawn of time obtains to-day, from the outer sea to the confines of Mongolia. An ancient and honorable thing it is, a fit profession for princes, a thing pregnant with ideals of honesty and fair dealing, a clean thing. There is nothing anomalous to the eye in Li Sin, a Manchu duke, unearthing the treasures of forgotten days for the New World, and exacting a just profit for the work. As for the medicine, that was another matter. I could no more imagine Li Sin accepting money for his healing art than I can imagine him stealing alms from a blind beggar. The thing was far too holy for him. There in that glass-topped studio in his house on Fifth Avenue, above the great treasure-store, he studied his science with the enthusiasm of an amateur pursuing a hobby. A queer place it was, with its retorts and vials, its glinting instruments, its Rontgen-ray apparatus, its tubes of deadly serum and of healing drugs. And beside these were the quaint adjuncts of Oriental healing: the twisted tubes of herbs, instruments that seemed like an alchemist\u0027s dream, medicines of black, occult art as well as of benevolence, secret, untraceable poisons, liquids which, it is whispered, would bring the dead to life for minutes, which would drive men mad. Ask the taciturn Lee Fong, on Mott Street, that slant-eyed millionaire. Ask the leaders of the Hip Sing. At the Five Companies of San Francisco, inquire. They will speak of Li Sin as a demigod of medicine. One has n\u0027t to go as far as that to find out. There is a tenement-house on Hudson Street, where the Bracalellos live. There is a romping child there called Beata. For years she was an object of research to physicians in hospitals, because of her twisted spine. Nothing could be done, they decided. They were wrong. Li Sin saw the white-cheeked child carried in the subway on a horrible metal stretcher, strapped to it. It hurt him—the illnesses of children always hurt him. He took charge of her. She romps about now as other children do. There are many cases of that kind. But above all in my mind there is the tragic case of Mrs. Madge Eaton, who is now happy as a woman farmer on Long Island. Li Sin discovered her creeping up an alleyway to die from hunger, shame, and heartbreak. Against all protestation he took her home. Her story was tragic and very sordid. She had married John Eaton, a man who had come up to Maine for a holiday. He had brought her to New York. In a month he had sent her out to work. She fell ill. Eaton deserted her, taking with him all her jewelry, all her money, all her clothes. When she was discovered, she was sent to a hospital, and when she emerged from there, she found herself without courage to kill herself and without the wherewithal to live. The police sent her to jail two weeks later. When she came out, Li Sin found her, broken, hungry, terrified, wanting to die and yet without courage to face the river. He cured her. He brought her back to life and hope and strength. By some means he instilled into that frail and timid heart the courage of a lioness. But he did one thing, unknown to her, of which she might not have approved. There was a tripartite function of Li Sin\u0027s: Firstly there was that of the merchant, whose duty it was to discover and barter rare and costly things. Secondly came the physician\u0027s, to heal body and mind. Thirdly came that of the Manchu prince, to dispense justice. He called Hong Kop, his body-servant, to him—that subtle and inscrutable Cantonese. He looked at the card on which he had scribbled an address, an address he had extracted from Mrs. Eaton. \"Hong Kop, you will go at once to Colon, in Panama,\" he announced. The Cantonese nodded. \"You will go to this address—a gambling-house—and there you will pick up the trail of John Eaton. You will pick up the trail and follow it until you find him. And when you do find him—\" He paused for an instant. Again the Cantonese bowed. \"You will kill him, Hong Kop.\" Six feet tall, spare as a lance, tanned to a deep brown, hatchet-faced and yet handsome in some daredevil, hypnotic way, with eyes that glinted with the vindictive sheen of a rifle-barrel, mouth twisted slightly,—enough to show the cruelty hidden within—Roderick Dreghorn lounged into the store with Irene Johns. There was an amused smile on his powerful face, as though it pleased him whimsically to accompany his fiancée on a shopping expedition, to meet her queer friends. \"Li Sin,\" she said, \"this is the man I am going to marry.\" The Manchu smiled gravely. Dreghorn watched him with an amused, contemptuous glance. \"There is no need to wish felicity,\" said Li Sin, courteously, \"to the future husband of Miss Johns.\" And Dreghorn nodded in an offhand way. The hunter turned to the girl. \"Didn\u0027t you want to get something here?\" he asked, \"some silk or something?\" Li Sin noted beneath the man\u0027s soft tones the concealed edge that could cut on occasion like a rawhide whip. Rapidly Li Sin was summing the man up in his mind: forty-five, he decided, a man of the world, a gentleman born, an utter blackguard, a man who had done and seen evil things. He had money, too—witness the plain but expensive cut of his brown tweeds. Li Sin noted quickly a faint scar on the temple that he knew to be an old bullet-wound, and a weal across the fingers of the right hand that only a long knife could have made. \"Would you care to come and help Miss Johns select the silk?\" Li Sin asked. Dreghorn smiled, and there was a lift to the left corner of his mouth that showed the teeth. It was like a dog\u0027s threatening snarl. \"I don\u0027t think so,\" he drawled. \"I am not interested in any products of the yellow or black countries.\" \"Indeed!\" Li Sin murmured. Excitedly, at the end of the store, Irene Johns told her story. Dreghorn—in a moment of boredom, Li Sin judged—had dropped in to see the family of the man he had known fifteen years before in Hongkong. He had heard of Mrs. Johns and her daughter from some casual acquaintance. Li Sin smiled; the casual acquaintance had spoken of the daughter\u0027s beauty, most probably. Mr. Dreghorn had been so kind to all of them! He had taken them out, had showered presents on them, had in the end asked her to marry him. \"Indeed!\" Li Sin thought, and he encouraged her to go on. He was so big, so powerful, she hinted. He had done big things, had had great adventures. She seemed a little aghast as she mentioned that. He was so compelling, she said. \"She is not in love,\" thought Li Sin. \"She is hypnotized.\" He was going on one more expedition, she told the Manchu. After that, he was coming home to settle down. They would have a house in the country, a farm. \"Agh!\" Li Sin exclaimed to himself. So that was it. The old, old story, as old as Cain: the rake, the scoundrel, after sucking the world dry of wickedness, wanted a wife, home, and children. Li Sin could understand how the girl\u0027s purity, her lightness, her youth, had appealed to the world-worn rascal. He could understand the visions the man had—the sweet, hawthorn-scented dreams. It was like a murderer seeking to wash the blood from his hands with God\u0027s pure water. They left. Li Sin escorted them courteously to the door. \"Good-by!\" he wished them. \"Good-by, my yellow friend,\" Dreghorn answered contemptuously. Irene Johns did not hear it. Li Sin went above to his apartment. He clapped his hands for Hong Kop. \"You will go down to where you know, Hong Kop, to the house of Ling Wah Lee—\" The Cantonese made his eternal bow. \"And you will have him find out for me, Hong Kop, all there is to be known about Roderick Dreghorn, hunter of ivory, with a bullet-mark on the forehead and a weal on the right hand, the weal of a Burmese knife.\" There is a doctrine in one of the faiths that man is born in original sin, and that unless he is cleansed by sacrament he is until the end of time the property of the evil one. There is an article of dogma in the same faith that one may become possessed of demons. If this is true, then never a sacrament was said over Dreghorn, nor ever was he confronted with the exorcist\u0027s mystic and terrible formula. Hell seemed to have employed him all his life and to have made him its brain and hand. The first of the story was bad enough, with its record of treachery, of gainful crimes in the dark lands, of murders concealed and never explained. Even Li Sin\u0027s worldly-wise mind was shocked by Hong Kop\u0027s report. There was the incident in the Belgian Congo when Dreghorn, allied with a corrupt Belgian official, burned a village with all the inhabitants, shooting down those who tried to escape from the flames. They had not produced enough ivory. \"Even madness will not explain that!\" Li Sin shook his head. There was the incident during the period of the Boxer chaos in Yuen-Lau, when Dreghorn and an associate had tortured an old mandarin, hoping to make him unearth treasure. They had given him the torture of the bowstring, and the water torture, and the torture of red metal at his feet. \"And he an old man,\" Li Sin thought, \"four-score and five!\" There was the incident in Mombasaland when the fiendish natives had captured a lone hunter of ivory, had crucified him on the ground, smeared with honey for the ants, delirious under the smashing sun. Dreghorn could have rescued him, for he was well armed and had a large party of natives. But he contented himself with stealing the man\u0027s ivory and leaving him there to die. \"That is one thing for which there is no punishment,\" Li Sin thought. \"No punishment is equal in horror.\" Li Sin read another incident, and he read no farther. It was the story of Marie Tirlemont, called Flancs-de-neige, whom Dreghorn had brought with him from Maxim\u0027s in Paris, down to the Congo. She had ceased to amuse Dreghorn a hundred miles south of Leopoldville, and he had abandoned her alone, in a village of black beasts. And now Dreghorn, Li Sin mused, wanted to marry. He wanted to marry this fair little American girl, pure and delicate as the petal of a primrose, light and shimmering and gay as iridescence on water—to make a home with her, to have her bear children. He called for Hong Kop. \"What is the profit of crime, Hong Kop?\" he asked. The Cantonese thought for a moment. \"The profit of crime is death,\" he answered. \"Death is a sweet and gentle thing, Hong Kop,\" his master mused. \"It comes to the old like a gentle and sweet-scented sleep. It comes to the suffering like a grateful anodyne. On others it falls so quickly and surely that there is no pain. It is not the profit of crime, Hong Kop, except for those who wish much to live.\" He mused again, joining his finger-tips together and knitting his brows. \"Unless, instead of being a sweet sleep, it is a nightmare, Hong Kop! Unless, instead of being an anodyne, it is a horror! Unless it comes accompanied by a huge and monstrous fear, a terror that clutches the heartstrings, a fear that kills!\" He was going away on the morrow, Dreghorn said. He would be away for six months, and then he would return, and they would be married. He wanted to buy her something before he left, a ring or a bracelet. \"But she wanted to buy it here,\" he sneered at Li Sin. \"I wanted to buy it here,\" she replied warmly, \"because here I can get the most beautiful things in the world.\" \"If you care for that yellow junk,\" Dreghorn laughed shortly. \"Roderick!\" she protested quickly. She was pained through and through. Li Sin smiled reassuringly at her. But Dreghorn wandered on. \"Anything you want,\" he told Irene; \"anything that pleases you.\" As he watched him, Li Sin became convinced that the man was in love, head over heels in, as a boy might be. The hunter became garrulous, under his feelings, as under the influence of a drug. \"She spoke of getting the house at Huntingdon decorated in some Oriental style,\" Dreghorn laughed. \"She can have it if she wants it. But I don\u0027t see why she could n\u0027t have it done in honest white style.\" Li Sin smiled blandly as ever. He might have been receiving a compliment. \"You don\u0027t seem to have a high opinion of Asia or Africa,\" he remarked casually. \"I have no use for any color except white,\" Dreghorn answered brutally. \"Black, yellow, brown, or red.\" \"It is a harsh thing,\" Li Sin reproved him. Irene Johns stood by, pale, nervous, and hurt. \"It is a grievous thing to wound the body, but it is a more grievous thing to wound the soul. And to wound it unjustly is more grievous still.\" \"I deal in facts,\" Dreghorn laughed. \"May I show you a fact?\" Li Sin went on. \"You have been in China, and if I mistake not, you read Chinese.\" \"Among my many accomplishments,\" Dreghorn sneered, \"is the reading of Chinese.\" Irene looked at him with a sort of fearful agony in her eyes. She had never seen his brutality creep out before, and she was shocked at the sight of him lolling across the counter and striving his utmost to hurt the smiling Manchu. Li Sin took up a book from behind him, a broad, thin book, the stiff parchment pages of which were edged with gold. He opened it carefully. The leaves had the stiffness of steel. \"These are the verses of Ling Tai Fu, of Tientsin,\" the Manchu said, \"a poet of the last century who had traveled into Russia. He complains bitterly of the same prejudice, and he deals with facts, which you deal with. Here is his poem \u0027The Return.\u0027 Perhaps you will translate it.\" Dreghorn looked down the page smilingly. \"They have laughed at me, they of the North—me, of the race of Chang! Because of my skin like an autumn leaf, because of my slitted eyes, Because they were white as the sun, they said, white as light! And yet—whiter than white is the leper. White is the hibiscus tree with fluttering blossoms, white as they! But whiter than it is the snow which numbs its roots in the ground! White are the men of the North as the sun, white as light! And yet—whiter than white is the leper.\" Dreghorn laughed easily. Irene shivered with a shock of horror. Li Sin smiled. \"Those are facts,\" the Manchu said. \"Is there any more of this?\" the hunter asked. He turned over the leaf. \"No more,\" Li Sin answered. \"I should have warned you about those leaves. You have cut your hand.\" Dreghorn looked at his left thumb. The edge of the book-leaf had sheared into it as sharp and as painlessly as the edge of a razor. A few minute drops of blood showed on the skin. \"You had better have a little peroxide,\" Li Sin suggested. \"I \u0027m not a child,\" Dreghorn laughed. \"It is n\u0027t anything. Come on, Irene.\" They left the store together, and, as was his wont with favored customers, Li Sin saw them to the door. The girl was flushed deep with mortification, and she shot the Manchu a mute appeal of apology. Dreghorn smiled again. \"Au revoir, my poetical friend,\" he laughed. \"Good-by!\" answered Li Sin, gravely. Li Sin saw little of Irene Johns for the next six weeks. Once she came into the store, but she was nervous and flushed, as though she thought the Manchu would hold against her the insults Dreghorn had offered him. But he took pains to show her that he and she were as close friends as ever. She was silently grateful, but still nervous. \"Mr. Dreghorn will be back in six months?\" the Manchu said. \"In six months,\" she answered listlessly. \"He is gone to Abyssinia.\" \"And you will be married soon after?\" \"Immediately he comes back, he insists,\" she said. The glamour and hypnotism and force of the man\u0027s presence no longer enthralled her, Li Sin could see. She was fearful of the step she was taking. But she was certain it was going to take place. Once Dreghorn returned, the quality of his masterfulness would grind down all opposition, even were she to show any. \"I want you to come in soon,\" Li Sin told her. \"I have some things coming from Peking that I want you to see.\" But she did not come in. In place of her there entered the store, six weeks after Dreghorn had sailed, a tall, heavily built young man with a tanned face, heavy jaw, and gray eyes. He asked for Mr. Sin. \"I am Li Sin,\" the Manchu told him. \"My name is Gray, surgeon on the Cunarder Hibernia, between New York and Algiers. Miss Johns asked me to tell you something, and she would like to see you, if it is not asking too much. She is prostrated at home. Her fiancé is dead.\" \"Mr. Dreghorn is dead!\" Li Sin commented simply. \"How?\" \"He came out of the smoking-room one night, after talking to me about his intended,\" the surgeon went on glibly. He seemed to be repeating something he had rehearsed. \"We were off Algiers, and though the night was fine, a cross-sea was running. He said he would not turn in for a half-hour yet, and the last I saw of him he was leaning against the starboard rail of the boat-deck. We never saw anything more of him. There can be no doubt that he fell overboard.\" Li Sin studied him for a few minutes silently. \"Dr. Gray,\" he said simply, \"you will pardon a man who is twenty years older than you, and who has seen much of the world and much of life, but—that is not what happened. Dr. Gray, how did Dreghorn die?\" He continued looking at the young surgeon. The man was evidently under a great strain. \"I know Miss Johns,\" Li Sin went on, \"and I knew Dreghorn.\" \"If you know Miss Johns,\" the young surgeon blurted out suddenly, \"you know the best and most beautiful woman I have ever seen; and if you knew Dreghorn, you knew the damnedest scoundrel unhanged.\" \"That, too, I know,\" said Li Sin. He waited an instant. The surgeon was uncomfortably silent. \"Dr. Gray,\" the Manchu insisted, \"of what did Dreghorn die?\" \"If you want to know, and have the right to know,\" Gray burst out savagely, \"the man died because he had contracted the most virulent case of leprosy I have ever seen in the tropics. How he did it, God only knows. He was quite well when he left New York except for a rash on his left hand. He must have been impregnated with some horrible virus. In a few days I had to manacle him in his cabin. For a week the man was a shrieking maniac. I thought something might be done when we got to port. There was no chance. In Algiers they would have put him in the leper colony. So one night I took him up to the boat-deck and let him go overboard.\" There was an instant\u0027s silence. \"I knew of the man,\" the doctor said bitterly, \"and I can\u0027t even pray to God for his soul!\" \"But I must!\" said Li Sin. \"You will go up and see Miss Johns,\" the surgeon reminded him. \"She will get over it.\" \"She will get over it, and be happy, and marry a good man,\" the Manchu told him. \"I will go to see her.\" And they parted. He went upstairs to his apartment, very slowly, very calmly. He sat down and thought for a while. Softly he clapped his hands. The silent Cantonese came. \"Hong Kop,\" he asked, \"tell me, Hong Kop, you who are young, how does love come?\" In fluting, sibilant Cantonese the servant answered: \"There is beauty,\" he said, \"and it calls to manliness with the call of cymbals. They meet and wing upward, as Chung Tzu wrote, \u0027like a hymn recited softly at the death of day.\u0027\" \"There is beauty, and there is manliness!\" the Manchu mused. \"There is Irene Johns, and there is—\" He smiled an instant, and became as grave as ever again. \"You will go to Brooklyn, to the Navy Yard, Hong Kop, and you will find for me an ensign called Nelson. You will find where he is, Hong Kop.... \"I am getting old, Hong Kop, I am getting old. The pear gardens of Tientsin are bursting into silver and mauve. Birds from the outer sea are winging northward. Again with the spring the musicians tune their lutes of jade. The throbbing chords do not awaken me, Hong Kop. Hong Kop, I am old.\" He rose wearily. \"Call the gray limousine, Hong Kop,\" he directed, \"and then go on your errand.\" He stretched his arms out for his fur coat, but suddenly he remembered something.
