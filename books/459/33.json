{"id":21931,"no":33,"title":"Chapter 6","content":"A piece of bog in process of reclamation—there the fox had taken refuge. He might be lying in some clump of grass. He might have slipped into one of the many drains the strong farmer had made in his attempt to make arable land of what was morass. Here and there were green patches, still dangerous, where a whole hunt might be engulfed. Neither the master nor the huntsman cared to chance their mounts in that treacherous sward. They halloed the hounds to and fro. \"Leu in, lads, leu in! Ranger, Rambler, Tinker, Tim! On to him, beauties, on to him!\" But the hounds were at fault, utterly. They howled with baffled desire. They went to and fro, sterns twitching, noses aground. Two or three beaten hunters turned up, their horses gone, their fire quenched, sitting dully in the saddle, thankful for the respite of check. \"We \u0027ve overrun,\" the huntsman grumbled. \"I \u0027m afraid so, Willie John,\" the master nodded. But some secondary sense told Morgan the fox was there. He had gone to ground and the hounds had failed to mark him. \"Try a short up-wind cast,\" the master directed. The hounds were halloed out, and as they swung to the left, Morgan noticed the red shadow flit along a ditch, slip through a hedge. He spurred his horse in excitement. \"Yoi doit!\" Morgan called. \"View halloo!\" But some trick of wind muffled his voice. Behind him three hundred yards away the hounds were following the huntsman about, heads up. The fox was tired, his brush heavy with mud and dragging as he ran. Behind him Morgan thundered alone. He damned the huntsman. He damned the hounds. \"They \u0027re going to miss, blast their stupid heads!\" But he kept on. His hope was that the fox would turn, and the huntsman and hounds see him, and coming up, finish the day\u0027s work. But the fox kept onward. Now across a plowed field, now across fallow land. Here a fence, here a ditch, here a hedge. What was the use of following him, with no hounds? But a mania arose in Morgan\u0027s brain, and he could n\u0027t bear to drop the chase now, so near to completion. A vast anger arose in him. He felt he had been betrayed. Never was a huntsman so stupid. Never hounds so bad. The fox ahead of him put on a new spurt, and Morgan dug his heels into his horse\u0027s flanks. Where was it heading for? He looked up for a moment and saw the four-foot crumbling wall of the old abbey. So there \u0027s where it thought sanctuary might be found. The fox sought the protection of the Fitzpauls, even now they were dead. A sinister grin passed over Morgan\u0027s face. Of a sudden he felt diabolical. Others might respect that sanctuary, but not he! He was n\u0027t crazy with sentiment. A hunter, he! He \u0027d hunt it over the legions of dead Fitzpauls. He \u0027d hunt it over Reynardine\u0027s grave, by God! How would she like that? Eh? He \u0027d kill that fox if he had to run it blind and throttle it with his bare hands. \"I \u0027ll get you,\" he laughed. The fox gathered itself for a last effort. He saw the whirl of its brush, saw it leap, disappear.... Morgan steadied his hunter for an instant. Suddenly gave it reins and spurs. Looked up, as it flew toward the wall. From his height he could see within and his hair rose in a dreadful chill. For standing there was a white figure, with a book in her hand. Against the white dress the red fox cowered. The face was the face of Reynardine. The years were the years of Reynardine. The eyes were the eyes of Reynardine, black, deep, dilated with fear. \"Reynardine! Reynardine!\" A cry of terror broke from him. An immense panic seized him, and his hands checked the horse as it rose to the jump—a savage jerk on curb and snaffle. The gray was already in the air. Its hind legs came down uncertain. Its great bulk fell backward. Fear flooded him like cold water. In an instant he knew his neck would be broken like a dry twig. Christ! There it went! Snap! \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3292/90027.html","bookId":459,"book":{"id":459,"title":"Changeling and Other Stories","description":"简介： When it comes to the publishing of books, people are always pessimistic, and, in my case, always right.
