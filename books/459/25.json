{"id":21923,"no":25,"title":"Chapter 6","content":"The click of the wicket-gate and he was gone, and down the frosty road his firm step was echoing. She stood at the long drawing-room window and listened. Eh, what a moon! And to-night the hare would be out on Three Rock Mountain, and the red fox pad toward the chicken-coops—the rogue of the world! And on the mountain lakes southward there would be a lid of mist hovering, blue mist and dark mountains and the white moon! And under the moon her own garden, her own house lay so quietly sleeping. Crisp lawn and the graveled paths and the high wall and the greenhouses glistening, and the yew-trees against the wall. And the bigger trees of the garden, the oak and ash, and the rowan-trees—the mountain-ash, they called it in England—all the trees that were silent now, even the wind being still. The low dining-room that spread out at right angles, and was thatched like an old-time cottage—how sweet it seemed from here! And the stables, where the horses were in their stalls, and the coachman and groom slept. The little lodge where the gardeners were, a huddle of ivy. Oh, the sweet domain! It seemed to her, when the old place and the servants slept, and the dogs were curled up sleeping, and the horses in their stalls, that she somehow was the guardian and protector of all this. The old servants were not afraid because a Kyteler still lived, and they knew they would be cared for, their whimsies understood. There being no strong man to stand against the encroachments of the world, what was better than her own sweet virginity? She could conceive of nothing harming the place or people when she was there. Even the spirits of the hills would pass it by gently; the dark Irish things that frighten folk in their sleep, the rumble of the death-coach, the wailing banshee, the thud of the Pooka\u0027s terrible hooves—none of them had power while she was there. Would she always protect it—or would there be some one else? she mused. A big man. She turned from the window and went toward the fire. The face she had seen all day in reality was with her now in vision of the fire—the face with the strong jaw, the gray eyes, bronzed head, and red curls. How every one had looked at him, she remembered proudly, at the race-course to-day! How fine he was! How strong, too! She had been a feather to him when he swung her up on the car. And when his hands had caught her elbows and her feet left the ground, her heart jumped, fluttered.... And how nice he was! When the old rip of a battered singer had wished them a multitude of children, he had blushed like a girl. And when he had lifted her from the car, he had held her for the fraction of a second in the air. He had thought she did n\u0027t notice it—and she had been afraid he would hear her heart beating, so loudly did it hammer in her breast. When she had turned him over to Rose Ann, to take to her father\u0027s old room and turned and gone into her own, she had closed her door and leaned against it, and said to herself, \"Margery, this man \u0027s in love with you!\" and then, in a lower, hushed tone, \"And, Margery, you \u0027re in love with him!\" And all by herself she had blushed terribly and felt in a wild panic. \"He will see it,\" she said; \"he will know.\" But then she said, \"No, he will not; I won\u0027t let him.\" And a song had come into her heart. A great pride and wonder filled her. She felt she should be dressed in soft scarlet robes, in some symbolic vestment of wonder and joy. But she came down to dinner in a demure white frock, her hair done very demurely, her eyes demure. And all the time her heart was bubbling with sweet, low laughter, and saying, \"Do you know, Margery, this man \u0027s in love with you, and he does n\u0027t know you know it. And you \u0027re in love with him, and he does n\u0027t know that either. And we won\u0027t tell him, Margery, will we? We \u0027ll let him find out for himself.\" All through dinner and after, she got him to talk of where he had been—Brazil and China—and of New York, where he was born and which he loved. She watched him over the sullen saffron candlelight, and she thought, \"He \u0027s got a noble head,\" and again irrelevently, \"You could n\u0027t muss that hair of his, no matter how much you tried. Those short red curls would spring back. I \u0027d like to try.\" And again she wondered, \"Will he try to kiss me when he says good night? And what shall I do? Shall I kiss him back, or give him a piece of my mind? And if I give him a piece of my mind he may never come again. And if I kiss him he \u0027ll think very little of me. It\u0027s awfully hard.\" And again, \"Ah, he won\u0027t try,\" she said. \"He would n\u0027t in my own house. And, besides, he \u0027s really in love. I know it.\" And he had only shaken hands with her, and said he was going soon, and might he come to see her before he went? And her heart sank, and she said, yes, she \u0027d be very sorry if he did n\u0027t. And he said, When? And she pondered over a possible engagement that did n\u0027t matter at all, and said, Tuesday, then, and her heart murmured disconsolately. Two long days. Through dinner and after she thought she had only been thinking of his strong, eager face, but now he was gone, all he had said she remembered. And she thought of hot China, and the sun-baked South, and the yellow rivers. And of Brazil with all its forests, and the speckled snakes, and the whistling monkeys, and the egrets standing by the fountains, and the little armadillo lumbering across the roads. And of New York, the vital city, with its houses challenging the thunder of summer skies, its explosion of light when evening came, its hurrying myriads, keen-eyed, alert. Against all these backgrounds she could see his clean-cut, gray-eyed face, and she could see herself small and slight, looking up at him in wonder and pride. \"I could go with him anywhere,\" she whispered. And then something seemed to call: \"Margery!\" She looked up. There was nothing there, but the dimmed loved room obtruded itself upon her, and through the moonlit window she could see the antique trees, and the silver glint to the greenhouses, and in a clairvoyant instant she could see the old men sleeping after the day\u0027s work, and the ancient maids, and Fenian in his paddock, and poor Sheila, and the foxhounds. She knew what called. \"Margery!\" \"Yes, dears.\" \"Oh, Lady Margery!\" \"Hush, now. It\u0027s all right.\" She had thought that to-night she would sleep as a child sleeps, and try to recapture the magic day in dreams. And be so happy. But the voice of the trees, and the murmur of the old house, and the pleading eyes of dog and horse, and the wailing tyranny of the sleeping aging folk shocked her into the knowledge that there was a sterner thing than dreaming before her. To-night she would not sleep. \"Margery! Lady Margery!\" \"Yes. Yes.\" \"You couldn\u0027t, little mistress, you couldn\u0027t.\u0027 \"Hush, hearts, hush. I will not go away.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3292/90019.html","bookId":459,"book":{"id":459,"title":"Changeling and Other Stories","description":"简介： When it comes to the publishing of books, people are always pessimistic, and, in my case, always right.
