{"id":21927,"no":29,"title":"Chapter 2","content":"\"Cop forard away!\" went the ringing formula of the huntsmen. \"Cop forard away!\" A long wail on the horn. The covert had been drawn blank. Two sharp notes and a halloing. \"Yo ho, Tinker! Yo ho! Tim! Forard, hounds, forard!\" And the pack of hounds began to move like a slow wave toward the distant woodland. The hunt followed at a slow trot.... Her name had been Petronilla, but through the country-side she was known as Reynardine, partly because of the Irish folk-song she could sing so well, with its haunting minors, its suggestion of superhuman music. He could see her slight form still, spiritual, virginal in the Irish twilight. He could hear her pulsating contralto voice: \"If by chance you look for me Perhaps you \u0027ll not me find, For I \u0027ll be in my castle— Enquire for Reynardine.\" No, he would n\u0027t look for her, though he knew where she was. She was in her castle, for sure! Her deep and narrow castle in the ancient, disused Cistercian monastery where the Fitzpauls buried their dead.

He \u0027d never look for her, even though he could see the monastery where she slept from where he sat on his horse\u0027s back.... They had come to a woodland upwind and the hunt had slowed down to a walk. The hounds were being urged in by the pink-coated huntsman.
