{"id":21933,"no":35,"title":"DRAMATIS PERSON? Chapter 1","content":"It must be for the thousandth time now he was sitting down at the neat table looking out on the little lawn, and trying to get his ideas together, trying to get something new, something startling, that would awaken these hard-boiled men who had control of theaters, magazines, publishing houses to the sense that he was alive, worth while, valuable. If he could only think up a new detective, or—or something. Any other than he would have given up the game long ago, but he knew he had talent—he would n\u0027t go quite so far as to say genius, but great talent. It was no use their turning him down all the time. He was certain they never read the stuff. He was certain, too, there was some trick, some knack he had n\u0027t discovered. Just some little trick. These men of national, international fame—he could see from their faces they had no especial brains, any more than he had. But just some little trick he could n\u0027t get. He had taken courses in writing, gone to schools of journalism, and here were all his manuscripts with neat rejection slips; here was what he thought the great American novel battered and dog-eared, a study of the temptations of a girl in the great city; and here was his crook drama, that some filthy reader had marked with the rim of a coffee cup. It was enough to make a man quit. But he would n\u0027t quit. He \u0027d be as big as the biggest of them. He, too, would have his pictures in the papers, not gaunt and bitter as most of them seemed, but pleasant, dignified, literary. And his picture would look like an author\u0027s, with its well-marked features, its masculine little mustache, its intellectual glasses. And he, too, would be interviewed. And he, too, would sign contracts involving great sums of money. And there would be gossip about him, too, in the papers, where in Florida he was spending the winter vacation, what he was doing in summer. He would n\u0027t quit. Had n\u0027t they all said at school and college he was cut out to be a writer? Had n\u0027t he gone to Europe for six months? And, what was more, had n\u0027t he the money his father, the hardware man, had left him? Had n\u0027t he his home? He could stick it out. His home! His wife! If instead of these few trees, this lawn, the outlook of the quiet sound, if instead of here he lived somewhere in the welter of affairs, wouldn\u0027t he be better? Somewhere things changed, where one did not have to go three quarters of an hour in a train to the theater. Down town in New York. Only trees and grass and water and sky here. Nothing to write about. And his wife, Berenice—oh, she was a sweet girl, a nice girl, but—hadn\u0027t he perhaps made a mistake? She was so good and wholesome! Too much? Would n\u0027t it have been better to be married to—to an actress, or a sculptress, or—or something. Some one who could feel things; who would n\u0027t smile, and be nice. Berenice was all right, but— And his mother. She was a nice, darling person, but—she did n\u0027t just understand. She was just a mother, like anybody\u0027s mother: If she could feel the great complex things! But she was just loving, and everything he did was right. Berenice, and his mother ... the trees, the water ... essential barrenness of life ... nothing to write about ... so unfair. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3292/90029.html","bookId":459,"book":{"id":459,"title":"Changeling and Other Stories","description":"简介： When it comes to the publishing of books, people are always pessimistic, and, in my case, always right.
