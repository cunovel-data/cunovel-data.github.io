{"id":21926,"no":28,"title":"REYNARDINE Chapter 1","content":"The big gray hunter caracoled under him, and with a vicious twitch of curb and snaffle Morgan brought him to stand. He smacked the croup and touched the gelding\u0027s fore thigh with the toe of his riding boot until the great hunter stood like a horse in an illustration. Then Morgan turned around. About him was the cold gray of an Irish morning in November. Woolly, dull, frost on the roads and a touch of easting to the wind—a perfect day for hunting. Forward of him a hundred and fifty yards the hounds were circling around the copse, while the leaders were inside, raising the red fox. Through the gray branches of the wood, gaunt as witches\u0027 arms, the pink of the whipper-in\u0027s coat showed like a Hallowe\u0027en candle back of a screen. And here and there were knots of the hunt, talking to one another as neighbors talk. There were the women\u0027s fluting voices; there was the men\u0027s deep laughter. All were friendly, toward one another, toward the world, toward the red fox himself, friendly toward every one except Morgan. Well, to blazes with them, Morgan swore to himself. What the blazes did he care about them—a crowd of country squires and young army men, of stray farmers, and an occasional doctor or parson. What did they amount to, anyway? he \u0027d like to know. And yet, he had thought they would be different. It had all been twenty years ago, and he \u0027d been away all that time, and he \u0027d been only two days back. But they \u0027d never forgotten. What haters they were, these Irish! What implacable enemies! What brought him back, anyhow? He could have been happy in America. Or hunting in England. What he \u0027d come back for was the red Irish fox. \"Steady, blast you!\" he warned the big hunter. \"There he goes!\" some woman cried, and \"No, Janet, no!\" a friend laughed. Janet! That would be Janet Conyers. And Janet Conyers must be forty now, and here she was still riding to hounds. Yes, he recognized a full dozen of them. Good Lord! Did people live as long as that? There was old Sir John Burroughs, spare as a lance, and old McGinty, who owned the Mill Farm. Yes, and the Master of Munsterbeg was there, red-faced, hale, all of sixty. And that Grecian profile—was n\u0027t that Di Connors, who was now Baroness Rothlin? And the big gaunt man with the hook nose, was n\u0027t that Ian More Campbell of the Antrim glens? Poet and soldier and horseman. Morgan felt a tremor of fear before the great Ulster Scot. There was the yelp of a foxhound and a roar of anger. The thundering master of the hounds was turning on an inoffensive stranger. \"What the—what the—what the blazes do you mean, sir, riding over hounds in that manner? What hunt do you belong to, anyhow?\" \"I don\u0027t belong to any hunt.\" \"Well, what the—what did you come out here for, anyhow?\" \"My medical man told me I needed fresh air and exercise, and I thought—\" \"You thought! You thought! Why in blazes don\u0027t you buy a bellows and stick it up your nose? You \u0027d get all the fresh air and exercise you want, but—\" There was a roar of laughter from the field, and above it rose Morgan\u0027s deep basso, like the bourdon note of an organ. But the instant the field noted his laughter, their laughter died. Morgan smothered a curse and moved fifty yards down where he could get a flying start away from the rush of hunting. How they hated him, resented him, he felt, and yet he had killed no man, stolen no money, betrayed no woman. They hated him as much as they had loved and admired his wife Reynardine. Queer! Queer! He was the one they should love and she was the one they should have felt aloof toward. For he was the steeplechaser, the horseman, the hunter of foxes, and she was of a family whose tradition it was never to hunt or harry a fox, but to protect and aid it. You would have thought it would be the other way around; that they would have liked him and been cool or indifferent toward Reynardine, these hunting women, these sporting men. But no! And that was twenty years ago, and they hated still. Twenty years! War and famine and pestilence had raged through the world. But they remained the same, these Irish gentlefolk. Yes, it was all of twenty years, nearly to a day, since he had left for foreign parts, and Reynardine, his wife, had died.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3292/90022.html","bookId":459,"book":{"id":459,"title":"Changeling and Other Stories","description":"简介： When it comes to the publishing of books, people are always pessimistic, and, in my case, always right.
