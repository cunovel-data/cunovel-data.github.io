{"id":21903,"no":5,"title":"THE BARNACLE GOOSE Chapter 1","content":"He might have been a hundred years away, he thought, as he sped along the road on the jaunting-car; he might have been a hundred years away instead of a meager dozen, so strange did everything appear to him. Every turn of the way, every stone, every smoking farm-house, every green field, was new. Even the sea to the right of him, beside which he had played for nineteen years, was dramatically unexpected. Faintly the whole landscape came back to him; hazily, as though he were seeing for the first time a scene that had been inadequately described in a book. First, there was the road itself, broad, undulating, rising and falling, like an artist\u0027s fancy. Then, right and left, fields of delicate blue-green corn, soft as no carpet could be; and great meadows of hay, sprinkled with white and red clover; long stretches of potatoes with delicate pink and mauve flowers; and here and there a gnarled apple orchard. Huge chestnut trees lined the way, and mellow farm-houses showed cozily, with their dun thatched roofs. Cows grazed in the distance—shining, mottled Jerseys and stocky Kerrys, black as ink. In the background the purple Mourne Mountains loomed like strange giants; and beside him the sea plashed musically, with a sound reminiscent of the chiming of bells. It was all surprisingly mellow, surprisingly rich, like the land which the spies of Joshua reported to lie past the Jordan\u0027s banks. Grant\u0027s eyebrows raised in puzzlement. The brick-faced driver looked at him with a horseman\u0027s shrewd eyes. \"I knew you the first time I put eyes on you,\" he said in his clipped Ulster accent. \"You \u0027re Thomas Grant\u0027s son—Willie John—that went away to America twelve years ago last March. And why should n\u0027t I know you? Many \u0027s the time I drove you when you were that high.\" He gave the dapper little mare a flick of the whip. \"I suppose you \u0027ll be settling down and staying at home now?\" he asked. \"No; I don\u0027t think I will,\" Grant answered; and he smiled as he heard his voice slip into the musical singsong it had n\u0027t known for many years. \"I \u0027ll be going back in a month or so.\" They whipped along past the sea for another mile, the little mare\u0027s hoofs striking the white road as true and as staccato as drumsticks. A strip of salt-marsh spun toward them. Eastward, over the sea, a flock of birds hove. Their wings flapped wearily, and as they flew landward they uttered faint whimpering cries. \"The wild geese.\" The driver pointed them out with his whip. \"They\u0027re coming back to the marsh. They \u0027re queer birds.\" Grant watched them as they came. Their cries came sharp and complaining through the air, high-pitched, querulous, turbulent. And still there seemed to be something satisfied in them, like the sobbing of a child who has received what he wants but cannot stop for a moment. \"I often heard my grandfather say—and it\u0027s little he did n\u0027t know about birds,\" the driver went on \"that there is n\u0027t a queerer bird in the world than the barnacle goose. The moment they can fly they \u0027ll leave the country. My grandfather saw them in Egypt, and he saw them in France, traveling all the time; but they can never get the taste of the Irish marshes out of their mouths, and they come back. The young ones go and the old ones stay. Even a bird does n\u0027t get sense until it\u0027s taught.\" They swept from the highway into a narrower road, and Grant\u0027s heart jumped a little, for he recognized it, broader though it was, and greener its hedges and smoother its surface than he had thought it. The sun was going down and a soft bronze twilight was beginning to settle. A little river ran past to the sea through the lush meadowland, and for an instant he saw the shimmer of a trout as it leaped for a fly. And from everywhere came the scent of clover. They had turned, almost before he noticed it, into the yard of the farm-house, and again the sense of surprise struck Grant like a blow. Of course he remembered everything now—the long white-washed farm-house, thatched with golden straw, with the sweet-pea and ivy clustering about its walls; the massive slated stable and byre; the barn to the rear of that, in the orchard; the white dairy near the big iron gates with its cinder churning table; the giant ricks of hay back of it all; the dogs running in the yard—sheep-dog and setter and greyhound—the two farm-hands stopping to look at him solemnly as he came through the gates; the thick servant-girl hurrying out of the front door as she heard the grinding of wheels. It was so different from what he had thought it was that he caught his breath in shamed embarrassment. A tall young fellow with red hair and a humorous twist to his mouth came strolling from the stables. He wore a tweed coat and riding-breeches and boots. He stopped short and looked at the car. \"It\u0027s Willie John!\" he shouted. He swung across the yard like a flash and grasped Grant\u0027s hand in something that felt like a vise. He slammed his returned brother a terrific blow on the shoulder. \"Willie John! I \u0027m glad to see you!\" Grant\u0027s father came out of the house, a spare Titan of a man, hair shot through with gray and a great bronzed hawk\u0027s face. He pushed Joe aside and caught Grant by the shoulders. He was inarticulate for a moment. \"You \u0027re back again, Willie John,\" he said simply and quietly; but behind the simple words Grant felt there was a wealth of welcome and of pleasure that David could not psalm. The elder Grant looked round toward the house. \"Sarah Ann,\" he called, \"here \u0027s Willie John!\" She came out through the door with a quick, trembling step, a very little woman to be the mother of two such powerful men and the wife of a giant—a little woman of fifty, with the face of a russet apple, with fine lacework about the corners of her eyes, hair a delicate gray, like rich silk, and a girl\u0027s mouth and eyes. She had Grant in her arms in an instant, as though he were no more than a boy. Slowly she looked at him. \"My son! Willie John!\" she murmured. They took him into the house, and they looked at him again; and they talked to him for hours, the mother with her eyes shining like stars, the father with that steadfast, proud expression on his face, the brother Joe in his riotous, loud-voiced way. It was a welcome that overwhelmed Grant; that took him off his feet, like a great wave, and sent him spinning; that warmed him with a flame, setting his heart alight. But there was something disappointing and strange about it all. They were just content and happy to have him. He had come back to their hearts after twelve years. They did n\u0027t care where he had been or how he had prospered. He might have just come from the next townland. He might have come back a pauper. Their welcome would have been the same warm, hearty thing. And he had imagined something so very different! He had pictured the land he was returning to as a thriftless waste. His own home he had never thought of as the richly comfortable place it was. He had seen himself returning in triumph from beyond the seas, laden with treasure, like Columbus returning with the wealth of Borinquen, or like the legendary Irish lad who married the Spanish king\u0027s daughter and returned to his impoverished people in a coach-and-four. He had imagined himself telling them of the wonders of New York,—tales as marvelous as any of the thousand and one told in Oriental bazaars,—of the buildings that tower as high as the Irish mountains; of the river of light that is Broadway; of the shop windows on Fifth Avenue, each of which holds a king\u0027s ransom; of the motley throngs in New York, greater in number than all Ireland holds; of the struggle and competition in which he, their son and brother, had won a sound business worth ten thousand dollars. He wanted to tell them of his own epic. He wanted to be questioned; to be admired. And they did none of that. They were only glad to have him back. And he was disappointed!","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3292/89999.html","bookId":459,"book":{"id":459,"title":"Changeling and Other Stories","description":"简介： When it comes to the publishing of books, people are always pessimistic, and, in my case, always right.
