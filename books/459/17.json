{"id":21915,"no":17,"title":"Chapter 8","content":"For two days in the South American city Lovat now raged like a madman, now was limp and gray as if all life had left. The storm crashed like artillery. The wind swirled in terrific outshoots of uncontrolled power. Rain whorled like a water-burst. And all the time there ran through Lovat\u0027s head the unending, pounding rhythm: \"The bridge! The bridge is down! Is down! The bridge! The bridge is down!\" Statesmen and ministers looked at him in pity, forgetting the country\u0027s loss in the great grief of the artist. Cecily he was n\u0027t worried about. He knew she was all right. There was an army to take care of her there, and their home was solid, would last against the deluge. Three days ago and no warning of this cataclysm. And now, to-day! To-day was like the Day of Judgment. To be sure, a half-crazy astronomer had predicted the end of the world, and sane scientists had pooh-poohed it, saying that there might be bad weather from the stellar conjunctions, but outside of that—nothing. And then, suddenly, this immensity of flood. Down in the lowlands, on the shore of the Caribbees, there had been havoc past imagining. Whole towns were swept away. There had been no chance of getting in touch with the bridge. All telegraph wires were down. Now it was Wednesday, and on Sunday he had left to discuss some details of the opening with the ministry and he had asked Cecily to come with him, but she would not go. \"Lover, no,\" she had said; \"I would rather stay here by the bridge.\" \"But, Cecily, you have n\u0027t been away from here in two months. Would n\u0027t you like to come to the city? There \u0027ll be clothes to buy and people to see, and an opera from Madrid. Come, Cecily.\" \"Dearest one, no!\" she had refused. She smiled. \"One of us must stay by the bridge.\" \"But, Cecily—\" \"No! No!\" She loved the bridge as much as he. On the little platform of the working railroad station he had said good-by to her. The train started and she ran alongside. \"Stop the train!\" she cried. He pulled the emergency cord. \"What is it, Cecily? Changing your mind?\" \"Dearest one, I just want to kiss you again before you go. Just once more. I \u0027m a silly woman.\" \"Come with me, Cecily. Come as you are. We can get you clothes in town.\" \"No, lover. I must stay and take care of your bridge. I don\u0027t mind who \u0027s looking, lover. Just—kiss me again.\" Had she some premonition of the disaster? Did that spiritual wisdom which we call intuition, tell her of ruin that was hovering like a hawk? Poor Cecily! How heartbroken she\u0027d be. Her eyes, her poor eyes, would be burnt with crying. Poor Cecily! Perhaps he could make her believe it did n\u0027t matter. Nothing mattered so long as he had her. Ah, but it did! He would never build another bridge. He might do mighty structures of iron and cement, immense feats of engineering, but never a great stone bridge again. Never again!... Poor Cecily! \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3292/90011.html","bookId":459,"book":{"id":459,"title":"Changeling and Other Stories","description":"简介： When it comes to the publishing of books, people are always pessimistic, and, in my case, always right.
