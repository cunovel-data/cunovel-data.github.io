{"id":21940,"no":42,"title":"Chapter 4","content":"They went out alone into the garden of the figs and pomegranates. The bright sun of early noon came down like a shower of gold. The doves made their faint thunder. The locust span his tiny wheel. From afar off, where the temple was a-building, came the clink of hammer on stone, the thud of ax on wood, the yo-hoing, the grunts, the curses of the workmen as they hoisted a beam into place.... And Solomon was shy as a girl.... \"You are wondering why I came,\" Balkis said. \"Will you sit down with me?\" They sat under a great cedar-tree. The pigeons thundered. The bees droned among the apricots. The lizard flashed upon the wall. \"I wonder myself.... But you can tell me, Solomon. You are so wise.\" \"Am I?\" There was a little note of bitterness in his voice. \"Are n\u0027t you?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" he said. \"I—I don\u0027t know.\" \"But all the questions that are put, you answer them. All the matters of judgment you pass on. Of course you are wise, Solomon.\" \"It is easy, Balkis, very easy, that sort of wisdom, for Nathan, as far back as I can remember, has been dinning precepts and examples into my ears. And at times, when things are difficult, comes a little inspiration, like a little unpremeditated bar on a musician\u0027s psaltery. And the tricks of reading a riddle are no more than the mason\u0027s tricks of arranging stones. If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth: and if the tree fall toward the south or toward the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be. And if that is wisdom, then I have wisdom. But I know not what is the way of the spirit, nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child.\" \"Poor Solomon!\" \"O Balkis, I wanted to go out with the young men, and to understand what they all understand and I do not understand: the way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock; to hunt and fish with them and know the way of a ship in the midst of the sea. But I never could, Balkis, for while still a boy Nathan made of me a man, an old wise man. Woe to thee, O land, he prophesied, when thy king is a child, and thy princes eat in the morning! So I \u0027ve always been a man, Balkis, a wise old man.\" \"Dear, poor Solomon! Never were young.\" \"Never, dear Balkis, never. I must never be young, never do a wild boyish thing. Dead flies cause the ointment of an apothecary to send forth a stinking savor; so doth a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom and honor. O Balkis, the long wise days!\" \"Poor Solomon! Poor dear Solomon!\" \"O Balkis,\" he cried suddenly, \"you came from afar to hear my wisdom, and you heard a little mouse-like noise. And you wanted to commune with me on what was in your heart, and I \u0027ve shown you my own heart, that is like a troubled pool. Madness is in my heart while I live, and after that I go to the dead. O Balkis, all is vanity and vexation of spirit.\" \"Hush! hush dear Solomon!\" And very suddenly his body broke in sobs, and his dark head fell on her leaning shoulder. There was a mist in her Arab eyes as she held him, as she patted him: \"Hush, dear Solomon!\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3292/90036.html","bookId":459,"book":{"id":459,"title":"Changeling and Other Stories","description":"简介： When it comes to the publishing of books, people are always pessimistic, and, in my case, always right.
