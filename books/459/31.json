{"id":21929,"no":31,"title":"Chapter 4","content":"First there was the minute red flash of the fox, slipping through the furze like a serpent, then the dappled flood of hounds, tails up, giving tongue like bells, then the master of the hunt on his great brown steeplechaser, then the huntsman, gay in pink, leather-faced with puckered eyes, on his little black mare. Then came the bunched hunt, the crash of ditches, the crackle of brambles, the thunder over turf, the splosh-splosh over plowed land. There was the cheering of the country-side. There a woman was down at a fence and men stopped to help her. There a riderless horse went by, mane tossing, stirrups flying. Now a groan, now a curse. The country-side flew by as in a motion picture. Patch of brown, patch of green, patch of gray, like a crazy-quilt. The crack of hunting crops, the ppk of spurs. \"Tally-ho, boys! tally-ho! On hounds! On!\" Morgan with certainty crept ahead of the field, not a hundred yards behind master and huntsman. Beneath him the great gray moved like a steam-engine. A little steadying forward, a rush and a thud, and they were over. Now a ditch was taken with a clatter, now a fence cleared nicely, now through a blackthorn hedge, Morgan\u0027s arm up to protect his eyes. Five minutes! Seven. Eight minutes! Nine. Ten, by the Lord Harry! And suddenly they were at Kyle na Maroo—Dead Men\u0027s Wood. And the hounds were sniffing, wailing, at check. An old earth-stopper, wizened, purple-lipped, like a grave-digger of \"Hamlet,\" appeared like a troll. \"Into the wood he went, your Honor,\" he addressed the master. \"Into the wood the Red One went, your Honor, like a man diving into his own house.\" \"Are all the holes stopped, Mickey Dan?\" \"Stopped is it, your Honor. Sure they \u0027re stopped as if they were the burrows of the devil himself and the saints to be out hunting him on the judgment-day. Stopped is it? Sure, a worm itself could n\u0027t get in or out of them the way I \u0027m after stopping them with interest and grand care—\" \"All right, Mickey Dan!\" The master interrupted. \"Hoick in!\" He ordered the huntsmen. \"Leu in, boys, leu in. Tinker! David! Dermot! Ranger! Tally in, beauties! Tally in!\" Morgan pulled up his hunter and turned around to watch the field come up, no longer bunched, but straggling now. The burst to check had been too much for them. His horse was still fresh, his seat easy. He had done a notable thing, following so closely on the master\u0027s mount—the great racer that had won the Grand National—and the huntsman\u0027s mare, fleet as a greyhound, with so little weight up. Morgan desired a word of commendation, even a look of envy. But they took no notice of him. He might have been some old fox-hunter, invisible, long dead, riding a specter horse, over some well-remembered run, for all the attention they paid him. To them he was n\u0027t there; he did n\u0027t exist. And because of Reynardine. And what had he done to Reynardine? It was n\u0027t his fault. It was hers. She was in love with him, and then she turned and was not. Was it his fault that a woman was fickle? Yes, she was in love with him. He could even yet see her dark murmuring eyes in the golden light of the candles, as she set there in her white frock and sang to him, her beautifully cut ivory hands plucking haunting melody from a pianoforte as from some old-time clavichord. \"Sun and dark I followed her, Her eyes did brightly shine: She took me o\u0027er the mountains, Did my sweet Reynardine. If by chance you look for me Perhaps you\u0027ll not me find—\" Oh, damn! What did she ever come into his life for, anyway! She didn\u0027t want a man. She wanted a poet. Crazy! That\u0027s what she was, crazy as a coot. He supposed her daughter—their daughter—was as crazy as she! First of all there \u0027d been the trouble about the hunting. She never said a word about it, but her face had blanched the first morning he saddled up for the Lonth. She had expected him, he laughed, to have the same crazy notions as her family. And her face had been drawn with pain when he came back in the evening. And she had said nothing. Too proud. Too damn crazy and too proud! That evening he had asked her to play \"Reynardine\"—not that he liked the tune; he\u0027d rather have had something popular, something with body to it, none of your blasted wailing folk-songs. But he just thought it might please her to have him ask. She shook her head, and plunged into Chopin. \"I don\u0027t think I could play—\u0027Reynardine\u0027—to-night,\" she said. And she had never played or sung \"Reynardine\" to him again. She and her folk had such darn queer notions. They thought more of a horse under them than themselves. They went to infinite pains and immense time to train a green horse or break in a dog where another person with a flick of spurs or, a crack of the whip could do it in half the time. True, they did it well. But, after all, you did n\u0027t make human friendships with animals. You made them do what you wanted to; or if they did n\u0027t— That was a man\u0027s way. But people are queer, some of them. One man is proud that his horse whinnies in the stall when he hears the beloved footstep. And some men give friendship to dogs they never give to women, and their hearts break when a hound dies. And to some folk the birds of the air will come and eat out of their hand, so confident are the birds. And the death of a rabbit is a great tragedy to children. There is a virgin glade in nearly all folks\u0027 hearts where neither blood nor marriage wander, but the love of animals possesses. It is some mystic link in the chain of creation. But he never had it. Never could understand it, Morgan thought. After all, man is the lord of creation, Morgan decided—that\u0027s true isn\u0027t it?—and all living things were for him to use. He had all rights over them, even to life and death. That was how some folks looked at it—not crazy people like the Fitzpauls. And Reynardine did n\u0027t like the way he broke horses. Reynardine did n\u0027t like the way he shot pheasants. She was a queer girl, but—God!—she was very beautiful! Well, that was the whole story of it; they did n\u0027t get on. There grew a gulf between them, and was that his fault? he asked. Was it his fault he was n\u0027t insane? Was it his fault he was too much of a man for her? And when she was to have a child, she expected so much of him. She never asked of course—oh, no! She would never ask for anything, but she followed him with dumb eyes. What did she expect, anyhow? It was no man\u0027s job to hang around a gravid woman all the time, holding her hand. A million women in the world were bearing children. What was there to it, after all? Every one did it. And then she had run home. Let her run. Crazy coot! And when she was dying and sent for him, did he refuse to go and see her, as many a man would have done? No, he went. He remembered well the soft April twilight; the dim white figure in the great bed, with the haunting eyes. And her four big brothers standing around with set, grim faces. \"My husband,\" she had said, \"for anything I did to you here, for any way I hurt, will you please forgive me?\" \"That\u0027s all right, Reynardine,\" he said. \"We were just not suited. And I forgive you.\" Then, awkwardly: \"I\u0027m sorry to see you this way, Reynardine.\" A light had gone out of her face: \"Then—good-by!\" Her hand unclasped from his. \"Good-by!\" he had said uncomfortably, and turned to go. He noticed three of the brothers look at the senior, Gilchrist, meaningly. Gilchrist turned to go after him. A cold shiver had gone down Morgan\u0027s spine. His knees trembled. And then came the very soft voice: \"Gilchrist, and brothers dear, in a minute maybe I \u0027ll have gone with the twilight, and I shall not be able to talk to you again, ever again, with these human lips. And I \u0027m going to ask you just one more favor, brothers dear, my brothers. Please do it for your sister. Let my—let this man go!\" Then Gilchrist threw open the door. \"This is no place for you,\" he had said. \"Go!\" A crazy breed! He had never heard from them again. Never had they asked him to see or support his daughter. He had even forgotten her name. But he did n\u0027t want to see her. He wanted to see no more of the Fitzpaul blood. She was living in the old place, he understood, which was hers now. Well, let her— But—funny! He could never get out of his mind\u0027s eye the vision of his wife sitting by the great piano, plucking out the ancient melody: \"If by chance you look for me Perhaps you \u0027ll not me find, For I \u0027ll be in my castle—\" The hounds shifted, grew keen. \"Ay! Ay!\" came the tongue of the finder. Scent was picked up again. \"Ay! Ay! Ay!\" went the pack, heads up, tails straight. There was a red flash ahead in the grassy field. \"Come up, Finn!\" the master shoved his great horse onward. \"Ay! Ay! Ay!\" They were off. \"Ay! Ay! Ay!\" Seventy hounds and forty horsemen. \"Ay! Ay! Ay!\" And one red fox running for his life. \"Ay! Ay!\" A dead fox or a broken neck! \"Ay! Ay! Ay!\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3292/90025.html","bookId":459,"book":{"id":459,"title":"Changeling and Other Stories","description":"简介： When it comes to the publishing of books, people are always pessimistic, and, in my case, always right.
