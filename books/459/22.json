{"id":21920,"no":22,"title":"Chapter 3","content":"Now by the ordinance of time and nature the old earl was quietly gathered to his forbears—to Gilles de Kyteler, who came over to Ireland with Strongbow; to Piers Kyteler, who could run against a horse for five miles; to Dame Alice Kyteler, whose name is still used to frighten little children; to Fulke, or the bastard Kyteler, who joined with Silken Thomas in rebellion; Hugh, who lost the family money in the South Sea Bubble; to another Pierce, who backed Boxer Donelly, the Irishman, against the English champion, Cooper, for a thousand pounds—and won!—to Hugh, who grew rare tulips, and to Patrick, of whom it was said he was the stupidest man in Ireland. Some one has written a book about the family; possibly it\u0027s worth reading, probably not. And now of the family of the Earls of Mount Kyteler there was only one left, the Lady Margery Kyteler, and she was alone in the world. Except for the ordinary natural grief for the old earl, whom she loved and liked, she did n\u0027t mind being alone. Mount Kyteler had now only seven servants, an ancient cook and two equally ancient maids, a gardener so ancient as to need an assistant, who was himself so verging on the ancient that it was a puzzle as to what assistance he could give. There were a couple of lads in the stable, lads of fifty, a groom, and a coachman, the coachman assuming the livery of butler on great occasions, such as in Horse Show Week. Ancient grumbling people they all were, who were united only in this, that they loved her. Among themselves there were always ancient grudges, present fights. And instead of her ruling them, they ruled her with a terrible tyranny. The old cook below-stairs was forever complaining of the great work to be done, and refusing to have any help given her. \"Is it bringing in another you \u0027d be and me here child and woman for fifty years? Twelve years old I was when they brought me into the pantry and set me to cleaning knives, and now it\u0027s on top of me you \u0027d be bringing some streel you \u0027d be getting out of a register\u0027s office, a woman does be following the tinkers to the Country Wicklow, mad with love. Och, to think of the insult put on me this day! Wirra, is thrue!\" \"Sure, it \u0027s only to help you, Peggy.\" \"And what help would I be needing, me that\u0027s the fine, supple woman, in the prime o\u0027 my years! Ne\u0027er a day over sixty I am, and thirty hard years\u0027 work in me still.\" \"But you were complaining, Peggy.\" \"Sure, \u0027t was only to keep my mind active I was.\" The old gardener could be terrible, with his face like an apple and his bent back. He watched her as he might watch a thieving boy. \"Now, if it\u0027s a thing you \u0027d be wanting chrysanthemums, my lady, would n\u0027t it be the right and proper thing for you to be coming to me, that\u0027s the head gardener of this garden, and if it\u0027s a thing there \u0027s chrysanthemums in it, you \u0027ll get them, and if it\u0027s a thing there \u0027s no chrysanthemums in it, you won\u0027t.\" \"I thought I \u0027d save you trouble, Darby.\" \"And what trouble would you be saving me, my Lady, by destroying the symmetry of the design? All the work that \u0027s on me, and ne\u0027er a hand\u0027s turn do I get from the young fellow that\u0027s the assistant. Devil the hand\u0027s turn he \u0027s done in all the forty-three years he \u0027s been here, barring playing the bagpipes in the greenhouse and talking about the good ould times. I mind the time your grandfather was in it, my Lady—a real gentleman him. He would n\u0027t put a hand on an apple, or a gooseberry itself, without asking the head gardener\u0027s permission.\" Also were the two ancient maids problems in their way. They were forever sniffing at each other, and complaining of each other to Margery. \"If your Ladyship would be so kind as to give Rose Ann a tip about her conduct, \u0027t would be a mercy so. For the queer way she does be acting with the postman is no credit to this house at all. New ribbons in her cap, indeed, looking for love, when she ought to be making her peace with God and man.\" But Rose Ann had the same story. \"If your Ladyship pleases, a wee word to Ellen would not be out of the way. \u0027T is the postman, your Ladyship, has been complaining bitterly. \u0027Ma\u0027am,\u0027 says he to me, \u0027would you be telling a secret?\u0027 \u0027If so be as I know it,\u0027 says I, \u0027I will.\u0027 \u0027Is that one,\u0027 says he, \u0027right in her head?\u0027 \u0027Is it Ellen you mean?\u0027 says I. \u0027\u0027T is that same,\u0027 says he. \u0027\u0027T is that has been puzzling myself, but why do you ask?\u0027 say I. \u0027\u0027T is the dirty look she has in her eye,\u0027 says he, \u0027and the queer conversation is at her. \"\u0027T is the world\u0027s wonder you never married,\" she does be telling me, \"and you the fine lad you are.\"\u0027 Your Ladyship should speak to her. You should so.\" \"I will, Rose Ann.\" But worst of all were the quarrels between the coachman and the groom. The coachman was a fine, florid man, and the groom was a wizened little troll who had once been a jockey. The coachman was always in decent black, the groom in corduroys. They were forever arguing on everything, from politics to horses. Once Lady Margery had come into the yard to see the groom stepping around like a bantam boxer, his hands up, his feet tapping the ground like a dancer\u0027s. \"Put up your hands!\" he was shouting. \"Put up your hands!\" \"Go \u0027way t\u0027 the divil out o\u0027 that!\" \"Come on if you \u0027re fit! Come on if you \u0027re man enough! I \u0027ll give you a beating you \u0027ve been spoiling for for the last thirty years.\" \"Go \u0027way t\u0027 the divil out o\u0027 that!\" \"I will not go \u0027way out o\u0027 that. It\u0027s fight I want. I \u0027m boiling mad for one clout at your ugly gob.\" \"Will you whisht!\" The coachman had seen Lady Margery. \"I will not whisht. Put up your hands! I \u0027ll not stop till I \u0027m dug out of ye!\" \"Kelleher, Brady, what\u0027s this?\" The groom dropped his fighting attitude and pulled off his cap. \"\u0027T is just a foolish wee argument we were having, m\u0027lady. I was telling this bloody old cod—begging your pardon, m\u0027lady, for giving him his right name—that Lynchehaun the murderer was by rights a cousin to my mother\u0027s people, and he said that it was n\u0027t in either side of my family to produce a fine murdering man like the same Lynchehaun. So I up and gives him a tip about himself and his drunken old mother....\" \"Kelleher!\" \"Not that I know anything about her, m\u0027lady, but I just thought that if he had any pride, it would cut him to the quick!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3292/90016.html","bookId":459,"book":{"id":459,"title":"Changeling and Other Stories","description":"简介： When it comes to the publishing of books, people are always pessimistic, and, in my case, always right.
