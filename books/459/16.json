{"id":21914,"no":16,"title":"Chapter 7","content":"Out of dumb rock and lifeless iron the bridge arose. First these were only amorphous objects, and then through the fire of genius was evoked an entity. The bridge had a personality strong as a man\u0027s, as houses have personalities, and some trees. It rose there strong and slim and beautiful and of use to men, but terrible as an army with banners. And though Simon Lovat and his wife Cecily said nothing to each other about it, yet there arose in both their minds that the bridge demanded and needed something. And ancient lore of bridges came to them in lightning flashes of memory—old stories of terror that told of human sacrifice before a bridge would stand. What ancient mysticism made the priests of the Pons Sublicius of olden Rome throw dummies of human beings into the Tiber on festal days? What horror of old made British Vortigern build his castle over the dead body of a murdered boy? Even in China of to-day, a pig was thrown into the river in times of flood, that the bridge should hold. And gnarled old masons told tales.... Old wives\u0027 tales! Ancient vile superstition! And yet, what wisdom had departed from the world since ancient days! Not spiritual wisdom alone but material wisdom. How were the great blocks of the pyramids raised? We were n\u0027t certain of that! The mighty things of Easter Island, yes, and the great stone legacies of the Incas! We did n\u0027t know. And the progress of the world was not spiritual. It was material. And we were n\u0027t even certain of material things. Why did they do it, Lovat pondered! Was it a sacrifice to the bridge itself? A tribute to the idol they had made with their own hands? Hardly! For that would be the idea of barbarians, and barbarians never built great bridges. Was it a sacrifice to the cruelty of the great elements that might endanger the bridge? Possibly. And yet storm was so powerful and so cruel when it felt that way that nothing would hinder it. What was it? He did n\u0027t know. And yet the bridge demanded, needed something. Cecily felt it,, too, he knew, for she spoke one evening in the lamplight, with averted eyes. \"Dearest one, it sounds a silly question, but why are you building the bridge?\" \"Because it\u0027s my work, Cecily, to build bridges.\" He felt what she meant. \"Dearest one, if the bridge were to fall, you would be heartbroken, would n\u0027t you?\" \"I \u0027m afraid I should, Cecily.\" \"Why, dearest one? Is it because you are proud of your bridge? That you want generations to remember you by your bridge?\" \"No, Cecily,\" he thought seriously, \"it is n\u0027t that. I—I \u0027m just a helper of the Master Mason, and if the bridge were to fall, I should feel I was a poor, an unworthy helper. That\u0027s how I feel, Cecily. That\u0027s why I should be heart-broken.\" She put down the sewing work she was doing, and came to him, her eyes misty. She took his hands. She knelt by his side. \"I know, my lover,\" she whispered, a little huskily, \"but your bridge will never fall. Believe it, dearest one. Believe it night and day.\" But the bridge bothered him. And all her wise courage could not still its silent clamor. He could watch the ant-like battalions of men as they laid stone on stone, chanting in the guttural Chibcha as the bridge-builders of Persia chanted when they built the Perl-i-Khaju at Ispahan. But above their voices came the silent voice of the bridge, loud as thunder. Until he could stand it no longer. \"What is it you want? In God\u0027s name what do you want?\" \"You know.\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"Ta-wak knew when he builded the great wall of China.\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"King Cheops knew when he builded his great pyramid at Ghizeh.\" \"But I don\u0027t know.\" \"The Romans knew when they raised the bridges of Gaul. You know, building me.\" \"I don\u0027t know. I won\u0027t know.\" Lovat broke from the place, his forehead damp with perspiration. And as he went toward his cottage, it seemed to him that the jungle and the mountains and all the creatures of the wilds were watching with their inhuman apathetic eyes the Titanic struggle between himself and the thing he had conceived into being, out of lifeless iron and dumb stone.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3292/90010.html","bookId":459,"book":{"id":459,"title":"Changeling and Other Stories","description":"简介： When it comes to the publishing of books, people are always pessimistic, and, in my case, always right.
