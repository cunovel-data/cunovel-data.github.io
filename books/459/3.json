{"id":21901,"no":3,"title":"Chapter 2","content":"As Officer McCarthy paused for an instant in his story the eyes of the court-room seemed by common consent to turn to Anna Janssen in the dock. The jury looked at her with knitted brows; the spectators with puzzled glances. It seemed impossible that this calm, majestic figure could once have acted the siren of the streets to the officer bringing her from her Tahitian sanctuary. Immobile, somehow immaculate, with strange superhuman dignity, she did not blush, she did not smile. Only a genre shadow of pain was about her eyes, such as creeps about the eyes of some one who remembers old, all-but-forgotten painful things of phases of life long by. Out of those firm lips like a rose in bloom could blasphemy have flowed in a sluggish lecherous stream? Out of that glorious bronze throat, fit for Magnificats? It seemed impossible, was impossible. The judge looked at her with moved, understanding eyes. The district attorney cast at her puzzled glances. Donegan looked neither at her, nor at anything. He just drowsed like a dog.... \"All next day,\" McCarthy went on, \"the blow grew worse. They reefed down sail until we were flying along under top and foresails. The funny thing was that here and there the sky was blue. You \u0027d have thought all was going to get fair in an hour or two, but it did n\u0027t. And the captain stood by the man at the wheel and looked worried. \"You had to shout to make yourself heard. \u0027Ain\u0027t it going to calm down, Captain?\u0027 I says. \"\u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 he says. \u0027I wish to God I was out of these islands,\u0027 he says. \u0027If I was all alone in the middle of the Pacific, I would n\u0027t give a damn, but these here coral insects,\u0027 he says, \u0027they \u0027re always building, and they sure do bother me. And these charts of the Marquesas,\u0027 he says, \u0027they ain\u0027t worth a damn. I wish I was out of these islands,\u0027 he says; \u0027I sure do.\u0027 \"\u0027Oh, you \u0027ll be all right, Cap,\u0027 I says. \"\u0027You get for\u0027a\u0027d out o\u0027 here,\u0027 he barks at me. \"\u0027I \u0027ll talk to you later about that,\u0027 I says, but I goes off, because I see he \u0027s worried. \"All we get to eat that day is a cup of coffee and a sandwich. And night comes and we \u0027re still plunging on. \"And then we hear thunder. \"Janssen won\u0027t turn in. She \u0027s scared, she says, and she sticks by me. And the thunder keeps up, and comes closer, and it gets very dark. \"\u0027What\u0027s that?\u0027 Janssen says. \"\u0027It strikes me it is n\u0027t thunder at all. It\u0027s some boat in distress firing a gun,\u0027 I tells her. \u0027It\u0027s too bad we can\u0027t do anything for them. But I don\u0027t think we can.\u0027 \"\u0027I \u0027m afraid, McCarthy,\u0027 Janssen says. \u0027That\u0027s no gun.\u0027 \"\u0027Maybe it\u0027s a lot of guns,\u0027 I says. \u0027Maybe it\u0027s the French navy practising. They take a funny night for it,\u0027 I says. \"\u0027I \u0027m scared, McCarthy,\u0027 she whimpers, and comes close. \"\u0027We \u0027ll be all right,\u0027 I tells her. \"\u0027I \u0027m scared,\u0027 she cries. \u0027Put your arms around me, McCarthy, please.\u0027 \"\u0027Oh, come off!\u0027 I tells her. That game don\u0027t go, Janssen. What\u0027s the use?\u0027 \"\u0027I \u0027m scared, honest. They\u0027s something going to happen.\u0027 The boat does a little jazz step, and the guns is right in our ears. And overhead, Judge, the stars were out. \u0027Please take me in your arms, McCarthy—just like I was your sister.\u0027 \"\u0027Well, you ain\u0027t just like you was my sister. And they \u0027s been too many arms around you for me to put mine. But you can hold on to me,\u0027 I says. \"And then my teeth come together with a jar and my spine is near driven through my skull, and something hits me on the head. And all the water in the world comes over me. And I know nothing.\" The witness, it seemed, here underwent a strange dramatic transformation. Until now in his recital, his story had been a story all could understand, a policeman\u0027s story, told in a policeman\u0027s voice, in a policeman\u0027s words. To the court-room he was a figure within their ken, a person to warm the hearts of burgesses. Honest, homely, speaking in dialect, he stood in their eyes for the typical and honored defender of city families and city homes. Great figures, those men! They make heroism casual. We may call the New York police grafters; we may call them brutes and tyrants; we may call them the scum of Ireland. We can never call them cowards. There is on record the case of—shall I say O\u0027Kelly? A homicidal maniac, armed to the teeth, took refuge in a cellar. \"And then what?\" \"I goes down into the cellar and I gets him out.\" \"Good God! You went down alone into that dark hole after—\" \"Oh, that was not\u0027in\u0027; he was easy!\" You can have your great regiments—your Old Guard at Waterloo; your Rough Riders of San Juan Hill, your Black Watch, your Bashi-Bazouks; your Bersaglieri. Give me the New York police! Up to now McCarthy had been only a New York policeman, telling in a dry way the facts of a case. But a new dignity arose in him of a sudden. He was no longer dealing with the processes of his profession but with big human phenomena. Until now he had been deferential to court and officers, a cog in the legal machine. Suddenly he assumed individuality, poise, dignity. He became bigger than the personnel of the case, as big as the woman in the dock. And curiously his language changed to fit the newer individuality, turning from the idioms of the sidewalks of New York to what we term, in that archaic phrase which has so much of dignity, the King\u0027s English. \"I came to,\" he resumed. \"At first it was blackness and a terrible headache, and the thought in my brain: \u0027Where is Janssen? I\u0027ve lost Janssen.\u0027 And then my head cleared, and my eyes opened. And I was lying on the sand in the dawn, and Janssen was bathing my head. \"\u0027So there you are!\u0027 I said. \"And then it struck me. Where \u0027s the ship? \"I got up on my elbow and looked around. We were on a strand, with trees behind us and a bay in front and the sun just coming up, bright as a golden eagle. In front of us was a sort of bay where the water was still and sparkling, like wine sparkles. And then I look out further. And there \u0027s a sort of wall of crags between the bay and the sea, and on the other side of it the sea is pounding, pounding, pounding, like a man crazy with anger. Swish! Crash! Boom! And then I notice pieces of timber, a bale, a piece of cloth in the lagoon. \"The schooner \u0027s gone, I understand. There \u0027s been a wreck. \"\u0027Where are the rest?\u0027 I ask Janssen. \"\u0027There are no rest.\u0027 She throws her arms out. \u0027Just you and I!\u0027 \"Then after a while I said: \u0027We \u0027re in a pretty bad way here—shipwrecked; without anything to eat; with a very small chance of rescue. We \u0027re up against it. There is n\u0027t even water.\u0027 \"But she only laughed. \"\u0027We \u0027re not so bad as you \u0027d think,\u0027 she says. \u0027There \u0027s water. I found it when I looked for something to bathe that cut on your head. And as for food, I \u0027d been in these islands a while before they put me in the—place—at Papeete. There \u0027s bananas, and there \u0027s cocoanuts, and there \u0027s breadfruit. And that cove is full of fish.\u0027 \"\u0027You can\u0027t eat fish raw,\u0027 I tell her. \"I \u0027m turning out my pockets then, leaving things in the sun to dry—my gun, with the shells out in a row; my watch; my knife; my pocketbook. She points at the watch. \"\u0027You can make a fire with the crystal of that,\u0027 she says. \u0027Your bananas \u0027ll do for the present. I \u0027ll go off and get some. You need n\u0027t worry,\u0027 she says as she notices me looking at her. \u0027I can\u0027t get off the island.\u0027 \"After a while she comes back and sits down. \"\u0027Do you know how you got ashore, McCarthy?\u0027 \"\u0027I don\u0027t,\u0027 I answer. \u0027I know nothing.\u0027 \"\u0027When the boat struck,\u0027 she tells me, \u0027you and I were washed over the reef. Something hit you on the head. But I pulled you in, McCarthy. You went down. You were out cold. I had a job, too,\u0027 she laughs nervously. \u0027Your hair is awfully short.\u0027 \"\u0027Well, I got to thank you,\u0027 I said. \"\u0027Don\u0027t mind thanking me,\u0027 she said. \u0027Tell me this!\u0027 She \u0027s awfully serious. \u0027Don\u0027t you think a life is worth a life?\u0027 \"I say nothing to that. \"\u0027Don\u0027t you, McCarthy?\u0027 she pleads. \"\u0027I \u0027m sorry,\u0027 I tell her. \u0027I \u0027m awfully, awfully sorry, but I \u0027ve got to bring you in.\u0027 \"\u0027You \u0027re a hard man, McCarthy.\u0027 \"\u0027I \u0027m not a hard man. I \u0027m just a man sworn in to do my job. I \u0027m just a man a big trust\u0027s been put in, and I can\u0027t fall down. Sis, you missed your chance,\u0027 I told her. \u0027You ought to have let me go down, when you saw me going. Then you \u0027d have been free. You ought to have stood clear and let me drown.\u0027 \"\u0027Oh, I could n\u0027t do that!\u0027 she says. \"\u0027Neither could I let you go!\u0027 \"In the afternoon I go around the island to see where we are. But from no point can I see land or a sail or anything. We are just on one of those Pacific atolls, as they call them, away from the line of everything but sailing-ships trading from isle to isle. I look everywhere—north, east, south, and west—and there is nothing but boiling sea, white, muddy, with birds fluttering, or floating in the air. \"The island itself is not more than ten miles square and there are rocks everywhere about it except around the cove where we landed, and that has a coral breakwater. The sand is bright and yellow like new gold, and on the island itself there is greenness that is nearly black. And you can see cocoanut-trees and banana-trees and oranges. And while I \u0027m standing there a little pig breaks through the underbrush and looks at me, and then flies off with a squeal. And for a moment my heart goes pit-a-pat because I think there are people on this island. A pig is a human thing. It\u0027s always been so near humans, it\u0027s nearly human itself. But a moment later something in me tells me there \u0027s no one here. It\u0027s been put ashore, it and others, by some of the old whaling-ships that are gone now. \"I look around and I see the island, the sand like gold, the clean wind, the water in the cove as transparent as water in a glass; the fish in the water and the animals on the island, and the fruit on the trees. And the sun is bright and warm and full of life, and in the distance I can see Janssen. She has let her hair down and it covers her to the knees in a great shining cloak, like some wonderful fur cloak. \"And I think: There\u0027s many \u0027s the old cop in New York—there \u0027s many \u0027s the millionaire, even—would like to finish his life alone in this paradise island, away from all trouble and worry and having everything he needs in sunshine that\u0027s more like wine than light, and with Janssen with him, when she has let down her hair. \"But I says to myself: You needn\u0027t think that way. You \u0027re not old, nor disappointed. You \u0027ve got no reason to idle your life away. You \u0027ve got a job on hand. You \u0027re a detective officer, and you \u0027ve got a prisoner, and you \u0027re going to bring her home! \"I return to where Janssen is by the cove and I look for my knife and watch and gun. But my gun is n\u0027t there. \"\u0027Do you know where my gun is?\u0027 \"She wheels around on me suddenly and points it at my head. \"\u0027McCarthy,\u0027 she says, \u0027your word\u0027s good with me. Either tell me now you \u0027ll let me go when we \u0027re rescued or I \u0027ll kill you.\u0027 \"\u0027I can\u0027t,\u0027 I said. \u0027I won\u0027t. Now give me my gun and be sensible.\u0027 \"\u0027I mean it,\u0027 she said. \u0027Let me off or I \u0027ll kill you.\u0027 \"\u0027I would n\u0027t be the first.\u0027 \"\u0027Will you?\u0027 \"\u0027No!\u0027 I says. \"I \u0027m watching the gun, to grab it if I can. Then I see a spat of fire like a match lighting. Then something burns my ear like red-hot iron. I hear the shot. I \u0027m sprung halfway round. \"I face up again. \"\u0027You made a better job with De Vries,\u0027 I says, stupid-like. \"I \u0027m expecting the finisher, but she walks up to me and hands me the gun. She just looks at me, and her throat works, and then suddenly from her eyes run two big tears down to the corners of her mouth and I turn away. \"\u0027I \u0027m going to fix you a bed of banana-leaves, and then I \u0027m going to light a fire. Forget your troubles for a while. Think of this as a picnic.\u0027 \"But the tears still run down her face and she says nothing. I go off and get busy because I can\u0027t stand the sight of It. I \u0027m not feeling any too like a comedy, myself. \"\u0027We \u0027re sitting that night at a fire on the beach, and the thin new moon is up. A light breeze is in shore. Suddenly she turns to me. \"\u0027You \u0027re religious, McCarthy,\u0027 she says to me. \"\u0027I \u0027m not exactly religious,\u0027 I say. \u0027I \u0027m like every one, I guess.\u0027 \"\u0027You believe in God, McCarthy?\u0027 \"Nobody likes to talk much about things of that kind. You think about them, but you don\u0027t say them. And particularly you don\u0027t talk about them to a prisoner who \u0027s up for murder, unless you \u0027re one of those Holy Willie boys. \"\u0027Who does n\u0027t?\u0027 I spars. \"\u0027You believe—\u0027 her voice is serious—\u0027that God takes care of you on this island?\u0027 \"That\u0027s what they say.\u0027 \"\u0027Do you believe, McCarthy, that He knows me, takes care of me, cares for me?\u0027 \"I say nothing—because I can\u0027t see it. She \u0027s too far out of the pale. I \u0027d like to tell her \u0027yes.\u0027 But I can\u0027t. \"\u0027You don\u0027t believe, then, McCarthy—\u0027 her voice is just a husky whisper—\u0027that there is any caring for me, anywhere.\u0027 \"\u0027Oh, what\u0027s the use of bothering about that?\u0027 \"\u0027You don\u0027t, then,\u0027 she said. \u0027You think I \u0027m too bad for—even—that.\u0027 \"I get up and shake myself. \u0027Maybe there\u0027s nothing to it, after all,\u0027 I tell her. But all of a sudden she is crying, her face down to the sand, as though her heart would break. \"I move away, because I \u0027m no good to her, and go down the strand a bit. The water laps the strand, and whispers in the trees, but I can hear Janssen crying still. \"I walk on and on. I hear the sea rumble on the rocks, and the whisper of the trees is louder. A turtle pluds into the water, and a cocoanut falls with a thud, but over it all I still can hear the voice of Janssen crying, little tearing cries, as though pieces of silk were being ripped from the main fabric with shrill protesting tragedy. It struck me that she herself was flaying her heart with brutal knout-like strokes, and that every red shred was moaning in protest: \u0027Don\u0027t, don\u0027t, don\u0027t!\u0027... \"The new moon became the full moon, and waned and died,\" McCarthy went on. \"But no help came. \"There was nothing to do but wait, and a policeman does n\u0027t mind waiting. All his life is waiting, except for a hint of action now and then. But I worried about Janssen. \"Janssen gave me no trouble. We talked just as friendly strangers might talk, waiting on a railroad platform. She got the bananas and the cocoanuts and the breadfruit, gathering them as they fell. I managed to kill a suckling pig now and then, and I rigged up a fishing-line from a piece of rope I unraveled that had come ashore from the wreck of the boat, and a pin Janssen gave me. \"There \u0027s nothing I like to do better than fish, and I sit there and fish and think all the time. And little things come to me of the life in New York, and I worry over them. I never was a grafter. I never took a penny from any one when I was on the vice squad, in the way of protection, but there \u0027s little things that worry me. As, for instance, when I go into a saloon for a drink, they never take my money. When an arrest is made, sometimes I find a bailsman for the prisoner, and they give me something as a favor. Or I sell tickets for this benefit or another, and nobody wants them, but nobody dares refuse. And I sit there in a few acres of coral in the Pacific Ocean and the sun rises in the east way over New York, and the moon sets in the west down China way. And the winds blow south from Japan or north from the edge of the world. And I think: It\u0027s very small. It\u0027s not worth a man\u0027s while. \"And while I \u0027m thinking Janssen is thinking, too. But what she \u0027s thinking about, I can\u0027t figure. She \u0027s very silent. And at times her mouth is n\u0027t hard at all, nor her eyes, either. And when she speaks her eyes are on the ground and she \u0027s very serious. \"\u0027What are you thinking about, Janssen?\u0027 I ask. \"\u0027McCarthy,\u0027 she says, \u0027did you ever, after a hard day\u0027s work, disappointed, clogged with dirt, come in and turn on a cold shower and suddenly feel better and cleaner—and be happy again?\u0027 \"\u0027That\u0027s the only thing to do, on a day like that.\u0027 \"\u0027Well, I feel,\u0027 she said, \u0027as if this island were that bath after the awful day of my life,\u0027 she said. \"At times I think, myself, that it must be getting on her nerves, this place. She \u0027ll want the lights, the gaiety, the people, if only for a little space, before she faces her trial. Even the chair must be better for her than this waiting, I think. \"\u0027Are n\u0027t you getting lonely, Janssen?\u0027 I ask. \u0027Does n\u0027t this get on your nerves—having nobody to talk to?\u0027 We never speak any more about the murder or the trial. \"\u0027Why, no, McCarthy!\u0027 \"\u0027I should have thought,\u0027 I say, \u0027that after the gaiety you knew you \u0027d find this a terrible trial.\u0027 \"\u0027McCarthy,\u0027 she said suddenly, \u0027were you ever at Saranac?\u0027 \"\u0027I \u0027ve passed through it.\u0027 \"\u0027Did you ever see the poor people there, quiet, waiting, glad to be alive, just being healed? Well, I \u0027m like those.\u0027 \"I don\u0027t notice for a while the change that is coming over Janssen. I see things on the outside of people. I don\u0027t see them on the inside. I \u0027m a detective. I just think maybe she \u0027s got the blues, Maybe she\u0027s worried. But one afternoon she comes to me and springs a new one. \"\u0027McCarthy,\u0027 she says, \u0027would you mind every afternoon keeping away for an hour or so from the cove?\u0027 \"\u0027What\u0027s the idea?\u0027 I says. \"\u0027Well, I used to be a good swimmer,\u0027 she says, \u0027and I \u0027m going to practise, and I have n\u0027t got any bathing-suit,\u0027 she says, \u0027not even tights. So you \u0027d better keep away.\u0027 \"I think to myself: \u0027This is a queer thing for any one as tough as they tell me Janssen is, to come out with.\u0027 And I wonder if she means exactly the opposite of what she says. She wants me, I half figure, to hang around. And maybe she thinks I \u0027ll fall for her. And if I do, she has me, I say to myself. \"And then I look up at her, and I see her eyes, and I never was so ashamed before or since. \"\u0027All right, Janssen,\u0027 I say. \"\u0027Thanks, McCarthy!\u0027 \"A week later she borrows my knife. \"\u0027My clothes are in rags, McCarthy,\u0027 she says, \u0027so it\u0027s back to the Garden of Eden for me. I got to dress up like these wahinies down here. Don\u0027t laugh at me, McCarthy; promise me you won\u0027t.\u0027 \"\u0027Not too much Garden of Eden, now,\u0027 I warn her. \"\u0027Don\u0027t worry!\u0027 she laughs. And next morning you could have knocked me down with a straw, as they say. She has strung together big green banana-leaves with fiber, and made a knee-length skirt of them. And under her arms and about her is a little closed jacket of leaves, and that great golden cloak of her hair falls around, rippling and shimmering. \"\u0027How do I look, McCarthy?\u0027 \"\u0027You look fine,\u0027 I tell her. \u0027You look like a picture, you sure do. You might be in a stage play,\u0027 I tell her, \u0027only you \u0027re so fine and modest.\u0027 She blushes pretty as a girl of sixteen, until it was a shock to me to remember that she was my prisoner for the crime of murder. And I look at myself, feel my chin, see how my suit is going. \u0027You make me feel like a bum.\u0027 \"The months pass and two sails go by. \"One I see in the early evening. A few very fleecy clouds shuttle in and out before the sun, and the great sea is purple, and the sand takes on a deep hue like the color of a gold coin that\u0027s been in circulation for years, mellow and reddish-like. And the green of the trees is so green you can feel it. And on the horizon is a native boat with a lateen sail that is orange-colored. \"I see it. I make no effort. I can do nothing. But it seems to me that it is unreal. It is not there. It is just a dream. It is unreal as the island is to me, unreal as my old life is to me, unreal as everything is—except Janssen. \"But a week later another boat comes, and this time it is n\u0027t unreal. Squat and bulky, it is a tramp steamer headed down New Zealand way. It passes not more than three miles off, and very ugly it is upon the sea, its funnel belching out black smoke that is like an insult to the shining seas. I have a bonfire ready-made and go to it with my burning-glass. And Janssen stands by and looks at me. \"\u0027Do I have to go back, McCarthy?\u0027 she asks. \"\u0027You got to go back and face the music, Janssen.\u0027 And I lights the fire. \"I get everything ready to board, but the steamer pays no attention. They go straight ahead. Maybe they think it\u0027s just natives, but at any rate they don\u0027t put about or anything. I go to the edge of the water and shout to them. I go into it up to my waist and whistle and snap my fingers and call to it, as I would to a dog, but they pay no attention. And then I give up. \"\u0027I \u0027m sorry, McCarthy,\u0027 Janssen says. \"\u0027What are you sorry for?\u0027 I asks her. \u0027You ought to be glad.\u0027 \"\u0027I am glad,\u0027 she says. \u0027I \u0027m glad for myself, but I \u0027m sorry for your sake, McCarthy. I \u0027m really sorry.\u0027 \"One night we \u0027re setting by the fire in the moonlight, and I \u0027m trying to figure out how the natives build their huts, because I want to build one for Janssen. There \u0027s a queer sort of rain in these islands. Sometimes in a bright sky a cloud will pass, very high, very quick, and the rain comes down like bullets. You can hear it thunder in the leaves, and rattle over the sea like pistol shots. And it\u0027s not so pleasant after a while. It\u0027s over in a minute or so, but Janssen ought to have some place when it comes. \"And Janssen is sitting there as quiet as anything, making figures in the sand and saying nothing. She turns to me. \"\u0027McCarthy,\u0027 she says, \u0027did I really kill Alec de Vries?\u0027 \"\u0027You killed him dead.\u0027 \"\u0027It seems like a dream to me, a bad dream in the night.\u0027 \"\u0027If you had waited and looked at that corpse, you \u0027d have known it was no dream.\u0027 \"\u0027And because I killed a man that was no use to any one I \u0027ve got to go back.\u0027 \"\u0027You \u0027ve got to go back, all right,\u0027 I tell her. \"\u0027Well, do you know, it\u0027s only fair,\u0027 she says. \u0027You \u0027ve called the tune, and danced it, and you \u0027ve got to pay the fiddler. But I \u0027m scared, McCarthy. I \u0027m terribly scared. It would be very easy for me to jump in the water or borrow your gun some night. Think of it. They put metal on your legs and strap you into a chair, and they put a cap over your head. And, then a man, as human as yourself, pushes a switch, and just as if he were putting out a light, he puts out the light of your life, the same light that\u0027s in himself.... And all in the cold gray morning....\u0027 \"\u0027Tell you something, kid—\u0027 I had this on my mind for a while. \u0027I don\u0027t think they \u0027ll burn you. We \u0027ll get you a good lawyer when we go back and you \u0027ll get off with a long stretch up the river.\u0027 \"\u0027But don\u0027t you see, McCarthy,\u0027 she laughs nervously, \u0027that that\u0027s worse still? A person does something, as I \u0027ve done, because his mind and his—his self—are full of nooks and crannies, dust and cobwebs, bad feelings, passions. And he flies away. And maybe in the desert or the mountains a great wind comes and cleanses him. And he mends the shattered self together. \"\u0027But the silly judge and the silly police go after him, and they send him to prison, and he sits there in the darkness and the wheels of his head go around. And the cobwebs collect again, and the grime from the other people comes off on him. And in the end he is worse than he was in the beginning. \"\u0027I \u0027d rather die, McCarthy—die, all in the cold gray morning.\u0027 \"A month after this Janssen falls ill. Perhaps it\u0027s a gust of rain that\u0027s made her ill. Perhaps it\u0027s some of the berries or the fish or something. But at any rate, there she lies, white and near dead, all the life gone from her. There \u0027s nothing I can do for her much but try to cheer her up and move her when she \u0027s tired of lying in one position. \"\u0027You \u0027ve got to get well, Janssen,\u0027 I say to her. \u0027You \u0027ve got to make an effort.\u0027 \"\u0027But why?\u0027 she asks. \u0027Why shouldn\u0027t I die?\u0027 \"\u0027That\u0027s no way to talk.\u0027 \"\u0027What has life got for me?\u0027 she asks bitterly. \u0027The electric chair?\u0027 \"\u0027You \u0027ve got nothing to worry about,\u0027 I say. \u0027It \u0027ll be only a few years up the river and then out again, and the good old days.\u0027 \"\u0027I won\u0027t live for that,\u0027 she says. \"\u0027Well, listen,\u0027 I joke with her. \u0027You \u0027re not going to make me come all the way across the world for you, and then not bring you home. You \u0027re not going to throw me down, kid; be game.\u0027 \"\u0027I \u0027d like to oblige you, McCarthy,\u0027 she smiles; \u0027but even for that I won\u0027t stay alive. Can\u0027t you think of any other reason?\u0027 \"\u0027It would be awful lonely, if you were to go,\u0027 I say; and I mean it. \u0027Awful, awful lonely. I \u0027m getting very fond of you, Janssen.\u0027 \"\u0027That\u0027s better,\u0027 she says, and pats my hand. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3292/89997.html","bookId":459,"book":{"id":459,"title":"Changeling and Other Stories","description":"简介： When it comes to the publishing of books, people are always pessimistic, and, in my case, always right.
