{"id":21924,"no":26,"title":"Chapter 7","content":"He was very handsome, very erect, very noble there, standing by the old fireplace. He was not merry to-night, so he was going to ask her to marry him, she knew. And in the black and white of evening things, bronzed face and curling hair, he looked the equal of any old Kyteler on the wall. And he had more than they had, she felt—abounding energy. She was very pretty herself to-night, too, she knew, and stately a little. He was hurting, hurting her badly, for he was speaking now of South Africa, where he was going. And he was carefully telling her how wonderful he had heard that country was: the mass of Table Mountain and the rolling hills, the great acres of grapes, the miles of veldt with the white Boer farmhouses, the sun forever shining, hunting such as she had never dreamed of, great, majestic storms. \"You \u0027d like it; you \u0027d like it ever so much.\" \"Oh, I don\u0027t know,\" she lied. \"Ireland is a lot to me.\" He was telling her clumsily, shamefacedly of another thing—of a lucky chance he had had in Brazil many years ago, a chance he had taken laughingly, and that had made him indecently rich, and he still a very young man. She understood. She moved away, and began hunting for a piece of music, so that her back was to him. \"Did you ever think,\" she said, \"of settling down in Ireland? You \u0027re Irish, you know. \"And it\u0027s not a bad place,\" she went on before he answered. \"It\u0027s a sort of sportsman\u0027s paradise. Fishing and hunting and race-courses. And sailing. And if you get tired you can run over to London, or Paris, or Madrid. \"Oh, damn!\" she said, \"I can\u0027t find that thing at all!\" She was trembling from head to heel. \"Why don\u0027t you marry some nice Irish girl and settle down?\" \"Oh, I could n\u0027t settle down in Ireland.\" \"No?\" \"There \u0027s my work to do.\" \"But you just said you were rich.\" \"That\u0027s no excuse for not working.\" \"I thought—I don\u0027t know.\" \"No, I \u0027d be a very poor sort,\" he laughed, \"if I stopped work because I was rich. I \u0027d have no self-respect—\" \"No?\" she said dully. The trembling had passed now. She was just numb, numb and dead. \"But as to marrying an Irish girl, Lady Margery—Margery—\" She stood up and turned about. She was smiling quizzically. \"You \u0027re not proposing to marry me, are you?\" \"Yes.\" \"Don\u0027t. Don\u0027t, O\u0027Conor,\" she said. \"Please don\u0027t.\" \"Why?\" \"Because of this—\" she looked at him squarely—\"I like you. I like you immensely. To me you \u0027re everything a man should be, but just—I don\u0027t seem to see you that way. I don\u0027t love—do you see? And I don\u0027t think I ever could. No. I never could.\" \"Well, that\u0027s straight. Thanks.\" \"Are we friends still?\" \"Of course, but—\" He smiled. \"Do you mind if I go?\" \"I \u0027ll see you out myself. \"O\u0027Conor,\" she half whispered in the hall, \"I\u0027m an awful son of a gun. I should love you—you \u0027re so fine, so decent, so—so everything—but I don\u0027t. I \u0027m sure I could never love any one. I \u0027m a very selfish woman, I sometimes think. It wouldn\u0027t have been worth while marrying me.\" \"You\u0027re not selfish, and you\u0027re very sweet, Margery.\" \"No, no! Shall I see you again?\" \"I \u0027m afraid not. To-morrow I go to London, and from there to Africa.\" \"O\u0027Conor, will you do something for me because we are friends?\" \"Yes.\" \"Will you send me pictures of South Africa, and an occasional one of you, because we are friends?\" \"Yes, Margery.\" \"And, O\u0027Conor, if twenty years from now you want to settle down, come to me and let me find you a nice girl to marry—oh! the nicest girl in the world—or if you are sick or crippled, come.\" He smiled. \"Promise me.\" \"All right, Margery. I will.\" He put out his hand. \"O\u0027Conor,\" she said. Again she was trembling, but her voice—thank God!—her voice was all right. \"I know you \u0027re disappointed, and—O\u0027Conor, would it help if you kissed me?\" \"No,\" he said, \"I \u0027m afraid it would hurt more. So I won\u0027t.\" \"I suppose it would hurt more.\" She stepped forward and put out her hand. \"I am always your friend, O\u0027Conor, your assured friend. And good-by now, O\u0027Conor, and God bless you wherever you go!\" \"And you too, Margery.\" \"You \u0027ll come back, O\u0027Conor, if you \u0027re sick or hurt, or want to settle down, and talk to me about it—your friend, O\u0027Conor, your little Irish friend. You won\u0027t forget?\" \"I \u0027ll never forget.\" He walked down the path under the cloud-touched moon. Would he look back? No, he would n\u0027t. He did n\u0027t. Oh, there went a man! \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3292/90020.html","bookId":459,"book":{"id":459,"title":"Changeling and Other Stories","description":"简介： When it comes to the publishing of books, people are always pessimistic, and, in my case, always right.
