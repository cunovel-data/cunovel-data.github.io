{"id":21905,"no":7,"title":"Chapter 3","content":"He had been home for a month and he had made no move toward returning—not that it was ever out of his mind for an instant, but it pleased him to stay there and savor the ripe mellow ness of everything as he might savor a fruit. Summer was fairly in and the yellow blossoms had fallen from the gorse, but roses were blooming in every garden, great creamy ones and others with the vivid red of an autumn sunset. The horse-chestnuts were heavy with balloons of white flowers, and every evening the bees returned drowsy from the heather of the purple mountains. There was something in it all that he had missed for years and that he was greedy for. At first he had gone about, a splendid figure, in the clothes he had brought with him from America: suits of fine broadcloth, and buttoned shoes, and a watch that was held in place by a fob. But nobody seemed impressed by this splendor and a few were covertly amused; and suddenly he had discarded it in a sort of shame, returning to the rich tweeds of his own people. He had helped a little about the farm, finding again a lost aptitude in milking a cow and in handling a horse in a dog-cart. He had gone to the fairs and put in a shrewd word here and there on the price of a colt. He had gaped in wonder at the antics of the Punch-and-Judy show and had listened to the croon of the ballad-singer. He lost sixpences with the trick-of-the-loop man and with the artist of the three cards. All through it he tried to keep in his mind and on his face the attitude of a grown-up who is playing a child\u0027s game, a patronizing superiority. \"If they could only see this at Coney Island,\" he thought, \"they would laugh their heads off.\" And he tried to remember as enjoyable the days he had spent there in search of amusement, returning in the evening a battered and limp and irritated rag. It was the evening of the Newry Fair when he began to think seriously of returning. They were all sitting in the great stone-flagged kitchen of the farm-house. From the long deal table in the middle of the room a huge lamp filled the space with creamy light, and in the lighted fireplace a kettle purred, hanging from its crane. The kitchen rafters were black and amber from the smoke of four generations, and below them hung at intervals long flitches of bacon. Over the mantel were the guns he remembered from his boyhood—his father\u0027s double-barreled fowling-piece with the long, true barrels; his grandfather\u0027s old musket; and the flintlock his great-grandfather had borne when he went out with Lord Edward in \u002798. His father sat by the table, reading a paper diligently, and he was surprised to see how hale the old man looked; he was sixty now and looked fifteen years younger. His mother fussed about with a pannikin of milk, followed by three mewing kittens, while in a corner of the room Joe was binding whipcord about the handle of a fishing-rod, occasionally making it swish through the air with a keen sibilant sound like the hiss of a snake. \"I think I \u0027ll be going back soon,\" Grant said suddenly. \"I think I \u0027d better be getting along.\" His mother looked at him sharply, but said nothing. Joe lowered his rod. His father raised his eyes from his paper. \"And what would you be doing that for?\" he asked slowly. \"Sure, I thought you were going to stay with us.\" \"I can\u0027t be doing that,\" Grant answered easily. \"I \u0027ve got my business over there. And I \u0027ve got to be making my way in the world.\" \"And why can\u0027t you stay and do it here?\" the old man went on. \"Ah, sure, what would I be doing here?\" Grant began impatiently. \"There \u0027s nothing for a man here. On the other side I \u0027ve got a place of my own, made by my own hands in twelve years. That\u0027s something, is n\u0027t it?\" \"There \u0027s no use talking to you,\" his father said resignedly. \"If you must go, you must go. But if you were wise, Willie John, you would take whatever money you \u0027ve made in America and buy that place of Peter McKenna\u0027s down the road. You \u0027d get it cheap now. And after I \u0027m gone the farm goes to you and Joe. If you have n\u0027t got enough money I \u0027ll lend it to you.\" \"No, thank you,\" Grant replied a little surlily. \"I \u0027ll get back to my own place.\" \"Ah, well—\" his father turned back to his paper—\"have it your own way.\" Joe sent the rod swishing through the air a couple of times. He turned to Grant with a quick smile. \"It\u0027s not back to your business you want to be getting, Willie John,\" he laughed. \"You want to be getting back to where the good times are. In a week or two you \u0027ll be walking up Broadway, looking at the big buildings you do be telling about. Or going down Fifth Avenue, maybe, riding in a motor-car. Or hanging round all day drinking highballs with the millionaires. That\u0027s what you will be after. Business!\" Grant turned on him with a sudden gust of anger. \"I want to tell you something, Joe,\" he whipped back: \"I\u0027m up in the morning at half-past six. I \u0027ve got the place open by eight. It\u0027s seldom I \u0027m through before ten at night—and twelve of a Saturday night. Do you know, this is the first holiday I \u0027ve had for twelve years, barring Sundays and bank holidays! And on them I \u0027m too tired to do anything. I \u0027m as hard worked as you are.\" \"I \u0027m afraid you \u0027re worse,\" the brother replied. He looked keenly at the hitch of the whipcord to the haft of the rod. \"It\u0027s seldom we can\u0027t get a day off when there \u0027s a fair on, or a good horse-race, or a coursing-match. What would life be if we couldn\u0027t?\" He swished the rod through the air again. \"And as for your father—\" he took a sidelong smiling look at the old man—\"he \u0027s hardly ever at home now since they elected him to the County Council.\" \"To get on in the world,\" Grant said sententiously, \"you \u0027ve got to work night, noon, and morning. There\u0027s no time for flying round to places of amusement, and chucking away hard-earned money. That\u0027s what\u0027s wrong with all this country.\" Joe looked up at the rafters heavy with flitches of bacon; at the kettle purring on its crane. He glanced through the window to where the full haggard lay. His ever-ready smile crept about his eyes. \"Oh, I hardly think we \u0027ll starve for a while,\" he laughed. \"Will we, mother?\" The little old lady with the kittens smiled and shook her head. \"I \u0027m not saying anything,\" she said. There was the sound of a gate clanging and the chime of voices. A dog growled and then broke into a bark of welcome. The voices came nearer to the door. Joe rose to open it. The mother put her head on one side to listen. \"Do you know who that is, Willie John?\" she asked. \"No,\" Grant answered, \"I do not.\" \"It \u0027s Eunice Doran,\" she said. She waited an instant. A smile crept over her face. \"Larry Doran\u0027s daughter, from beyond the hill.\" \"Oh, to be sure; I remember her,\" Grant smiled back. Of course he did—a lank, gray-eyed girl, with a habit of staring you out of countenance. The last time he had seen her she was fifteen, with long arms and legs that seemed eternally in the way; and he recalled, with a smile, how in those days he had been a little in love with her, and they had passed many queer, awkward moments together. A funny, pathetic thing! And as he thought of it a shutter in his mind opened and he saw again the girl he had left on the stoop in Schermerhorn Street, with her chic way and flashing eyes. He wondered what she would think if she knew he had once had a boyish affair with this simple thing from his own townland; and he blushed in imagining her teasing laughter. He warmed with a glow of pride as he thought of her,—of Miss Levine, as he somehow always called her to himself,—of her marvelous clothes, of her manicured hands and wonderful eyebrows, of her appreciation of the latest effort of a cinematograph comedian, and her up-to-dateness with the last flivver joke. He smiled, too, as he thought of the wonder with which this poor country girl would regard the metropolitan divinity. She came into the room slowly; and, though he could distinguish little of her features or form, he felt a sense of shock, for somehow he had expected a lanky, overgrown girl with arms and hands like the awkward legs of a foal—and what he saw was a tall woman, as tall as he, who moved with the slow dignity of a queen. She threw her cloak off and Joe took it from her, and as it fell Grant caught one instantaneous glimpse of her that effectually wiped the Brooklyn girl from his mind, like a sponge passing over a chalked slate. He saw first the great mass of black hair knotted at the back of her head, which seemed less like hair than a splash of dim, vivid color; and from a side view he saw the small nose, with the sensitive nostrils, as clearly cut as the nose on an intaglio; and the line of chin sweeping down, as it were, in one soft, firm stroke. That was all he saw for a minute—that and the flush on her cheeks. \"How are you?\" she said to his mother. \"And how are you, Mr. Grant? And Joe?\" She turned to Grant, looked at him for an instant and put out her hand. \"And this is Willie John,\" she said. \"You \u0027ve been a long time away, Willie John.\" He saw, as he looked at her, how very gray her eyes were, and how very deep—like orifices through which light shone—and how very steady. He noticed that her mouth was firm, and that she seemed to have lived each instant of her twenty-seven years; and still she was a woman with the first flush of beauty on her. She turned away to talk to his mother and he saw for the first time that her servant-girl was with her. So engrossed had he been with her entry, and so shocked by seeing her beauty, that he had seen only her. \"I \u0027m going to have the flax pulled on the ten-acre,\" she was saying—and Grant felt every syllable of her low contralto strike him clear and compelling—\"so I \u0027m asking the neighbors fair and early. My father \u0027s dead, Willie John—\" she turned to Grant for a moment—\"and I \u0027ve the place on my hands.\" \"Ay; I heard that, Eunice,\" he said. \"I was sorry to hear it.\" \"You \u0027ll be going back soon?\" she asked. \"I \u0027ll be going back very soon now,\" he said. \"In a couple of weeks at most.\" \"I \u0027ve been wanting him to stay and settle down,\" his father broke in; \"but there \u0027s no use talking to him.\" \"Ah, there\u0027s nothing for a man here,\" he answered disgustedly. \"It\u0027s on the other side a man gets his chance—ay, and a woman, too, for that matter.\" \"Is that so?\" Eunice uttered; and she caught him with her serious gray eyes. \"There was Joe Carragher\u0027s daughter, from Balleek,\" he instanced; \"you knew her well. She went over six years ago and now she \u0027s a lady\u0027s maid in one of the big houses on Fifth Avenue. A grand position!\" \"Is that so?\" she repeated; her eyes had narrowed a little and she was studying him intently. \"Then there was Patrick Hagan, the brother of the captain in the Dublin Fusiliers. He \u0027s got a saloon on Third Avenue and does a grand business.\" \"That\u0027s the devil\u0027s business, Willie John,\" his mother said quietly. It was the first time since he came back that he had seen her without a smile on her lips. \"It\u0027s different on the other side, I tell you,\" Grant commented with asperity. \"And there\u0027s Barney Doyle, that went over before me; he \u0027s head waiter in one of the big places on Broadway. Do you know that fellow makes as much as seventy dollars a week in tips? Seventy dollars! Fourteen pounds!\" \"His father was a great lawyer.\" Old Grant shook his head. \"God be good to him! They called him the Star of the North.\" \"Fourteen pounds a week—in tips!\" Grant thought he could detect a chill, contemptuous tone in the Doran girl\u0027s voice; but he put the thought out of his head, for why should she be contemptuous? She drew her blue cloak about her. \"I think I \u0027ll be going,\" she said. \"I \u0027ll leave you a bit of the road,\" Grant offered. They went out and down the loaning. Overhead a great white moon showed, a great silver plate of a thing whose beams scintillated in minute gossamer threads. Before them the road ran, as white as the moon, and everything showed in a faint purple—trees, fields, the singing river on the left of them, and the hill that rose between them and the sea. A little breeze was stirring and they could hear a soft soughing from the trees and a murmur from the beach. Somewhere behind them, on the Yellow Road probably, a corn-crake was venting its harmoniously raucous cry. They stopped and looked about them. Beneath them the great plain of Louth lay, which Maeve of Connaught had once raided at the head of a hundred thousand men. And as Grant looked at it in the subtle moonlight the memory of forgotten legends came to him in vague unco?rdinated fragments. There was Slieve Gullion behind him, where Cuala, the great artificer, hammered on his magic anvil night and day, and up whose slopes Finn MacCool had pursued the white deer without horns. And in front of him was the sea, where for thrice three hundred years the Children of Lir had mourned in the guise of white swans. And on the hill beside him was the fortress of Bricriu of the poisoned tongue, whose satires killed men and withered the leaves on the green trees. Suddenly he heard Eunice\u0027s voice addressing him. \"I suppose you \u0027ve done well for yourself, Willie John?\" she asked. \"Ay; I \u0027ve done well,\" he told her. \"I \u0027ve got a business over there worth ten thousand dollars. And I \u0027ve built it up in twelve years.\" \"Ten thousand dollars!\" she mused. \"Two thousand pounds; that\u0027s a good deal. That\u0027s half as much as your brother Joe made, and it\u0027s a great deal more than I have myself.\" \"Brother Joe made!\" he muttered in a tone of amazement. \"Yes—your brother Joe made,\" she answered na?vely. \"He \u0027s made as much as four thousand pounds trading in cattle between here and England, and buying horses for the Italian Government.\" \"Twenty thousand dollars!\" Grant said, dumb-founded. \"Brother Joe!\" \"And you \u0027ve more than I have,\" she continued mercilessly. \"The Cliff Farm is worth only eighteen hundred pounds. That\u0027s only nine thousand of your dollars.\" He answered nothing, for a quick sense of shame suddenly suffused him when he remembered how much he had talked, and the others keeping so dumb. Something began tumbling very fast about him. They went up the hill and suddenly the sea stretched before them, sheer through to England, a vast surface of shimmering ripples, where the moon touched, and here and there white curling waves. And beneath them it murmured on the beach in a steady crooning. The breeze blew landward and pressed about them firmly in a cool, even motion. To the right the Cliff Farm lay, softly white, and a faint scent came down from its orchard. The servant-girl passed through the gate and up toward the house. \"America \u0027s a great country!\" Grant said aloud. He did not know why he said it. Perhaps it was because he could find nothing else to say, and perhaps it was a sort of incantation, conjuring away the doubts that were rising in his mind. Eunice made no answer. And as he looked at her, standing there in the moonlight and the breeze, the old affection he had for her a dozen years ago rose within him, and he wondered whether he should n\u0027t put his arm about her and kiss her for old times\u0027 sake. But the idea left him as soon as it came, for the thought of trifling with her seemed a desecration. \"It\u0027s a great place!\" he said again lamely. She swung around upon him suddenly, savagely, her head tilted, her eyes flashing. The cloak behind her stood backward with the breeze; and as he watched her, amazed, petrified almost, the thought of dead ancient Irish women flashed through his brain—Maeve, the fighting queen of Connaught; and Deirdre, who dashed herself dead against a rock; and Grainne, the king\u0027s daughter, who fled to follow Diarmuid of the Spears. \"Then why don\u0027t you stay there?\" she uttered passionately. \"Why don\u0027t I stay there?\" he repeated blankly. \"Why don\u0027t you stay there?\" she said again. \"You come back here—you and your like—with a smile on your mouth and a sneer in your eye. You come back here in your fine clothes, that you \u0027ve sweated day and night for, and taken charity to get—ay, charity! What\u0027s tips but charity?—And you lord it round for a while and tell us what fools we are—and patronize us. Patronize us!\" She swung round and fronted the low-lying land with the faint blue heat haze of summer over it, touched into silver in the June moon. The muscles of her throat were throbbing. She was poised on her feet like a bird ready for flight. \"Look down there at your father\u0027s farm,\" she told him. Her hand stretched toward it and her gray eyes blazed in his face. \"Look at it well! Look at the corn that\u0027s green, and the rye ripening, and the stacked haggard. Look at the trees in the orchard and the fruit hanging from them, and the river alive with trout, and the mountain with its grouse and hares. And then go back to your grand business and fumble the halfpence in your greasy till!\" He said nothing. Mechanically his eyes followed her hand where it pointed, and every word ate its meaning into his brain as if etched by strong acid. \"Ay!\" he said dully. \"Have you eyes to see, man?\" She bent toward him with her hands outstretched and her face aflame with anger. \"Or have you ears to hear? Or has groping for coppers made you blind like a mole? Or the tinkle of tuppences deafened you the like of a bat?\" \"I \u0027ve got eyes,\" he answered sullenly. \"Use them, then!\" she snapped. \"And when you go back to your grand business, stop making a poor mouth about Ireland. Don\u0027t whine the like of a beggar in the street. Stop your talk about poverty-stricken Ireland, and oppressed Ireland and lazy Ireland. We \u0027ve got money here as well as you, for all your grand business; and we\u0027ve got pride; and we \u0027ve got strength. And we don\u0027t want anybody talking about our sorrows, and the nations pitying us in the four corners of the earth.\" He said nothing, but his face had gone white; and every now and then he winced, as though he had been caught by a whip. He wished to Heaven she would stop; and still, back in him, something had awakened that yearned to be lashed into life. \"I heard you wanted your father and mother to go back to America with you and partake of the grand business. Look at that farm-house again. Your grandfather built that with granite hewn from his own quarry. And you want them to leave that and to go off with you and grub in a huckster\u0027s booth! God\u0027s glory and the blue sky over us!\" There was the rapid flapping of wings and they saw a wedge of birds in the moonlight. Suddenly they caught the shrill clamor of the barnacle goose. \"Even the birds,\" she uttered with scorn, \"even the birds have sense. They \u0027re happy when they get back from roving. Not like you and your like, Willie John. If you want to go, go! And God go with you! If you want to stay, stay—and you\u0027re welcome. But don\u0027t come back for a while, croaking like a magpie chattering over a ruined hearth.\" She turned to him, and the agitation and passion seemed to leave her by a great effort of will. Her hands unclenched and her voice grew calm, with even a queer crooning melody in it; but her bosom heaved tumultuously. \"I liked you once, Willie John,\" she said. \"I thought there was the makings of a big man in you. I mind the time at the football, and you running down the field like a hare, and no one to catch or trip you. And at the fairs I mind you putting the horses through their paces like a jockey born. And at throwing the weight there was no one of your size or years that could best you. Ay! I mind you, and your dogs following you, and your head high up in the air. I thought well of you that time, Willie John. I thought there was no one like you.\" She raised herself to her full height and looked at him squarely. \"But now,\" she said, \"I \u0027d rather have a stray tinker that does be traveling the roads.\" And scornfully she left him. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3292/90001.html","bookId":459,"book":{"id":459,"title":"Changeling and Other Stories","description":"简介： When it comes to the publishing of books, people are always pessimistic, and, in my case, always right.
