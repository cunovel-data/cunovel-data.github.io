And Balkis\u0027s eyes flashed with anger at the cunning of the Phoenician king. It was such a shame to take advantage of the boy! Poor wise-foolish king! He was like a child showing his toys. \"See these brass bases, Balkis, with the borders of lions and oxen and cherubim. And the brazen wheels at each base. They say there are cunning brass-workers in India, but surely there is no more beautiful work than this. Surely they cannot beat this.\" \"Of course not, my dearest. Of course not.\" \"And come with me, Balkis, to where the watchmen are, and I will show you marvels such as you never saw before: an altar of gold and a table of gold and ten candlesticks of pure gold with the flowers and the lamps and the tongs of gold; and bowls and snuffers and basins and the spoons and the censers of pure gold.

For an instant laughter bubbled in her, but gave way to pathos, and her sloe-black eyes were wet again. O poor lad! \"Is it very much bigger than the pyramids, Balkis?\" he asked eagerly. \"Oh, lots bigger. Much.\" \"Why, Balkis, you are crying. Are you lonely?\" \"Yes, a little homesick,\" she lied again. He came toward her and kissed her, in kindness, but the touch of lips fired, startled them both, sent their blood pounding in the soft Syrian gloom. \"O Balkis!\" his voice trembled. \"O Balkis!\" \"Solomon!\" she uttered softly. \"Dear Solomon!\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3292/90037.html","bookId":459,"book":{"id":459,"title":"Changeling and Other Stories","description":"简介： When it comes to the publishing of books, people are always pessimistic, and, in my case, always right.
