{"id":21912,"no":14,"title":"Chapter 5","content":"Lovat told her his fear that never again would great stone bridges be built. The days of beauty in bridges were past, like the days of chivalry. Long steel suspension bridges, with their infinity of metal triangles, or marvels of carpentry, such as the Portage Bridge over the Genesee. But never again would they build bridges such as the Romans did, like the dreadful Pont du Gard at N?mes. \"They will, Simon,\" she told him. \"You will build like that.\" \"Never, Cecily. Never again!\" \"Yes, Simon. I know.\" \"All those days are gone, Cecily.\" \"Not for you.\" The conviction would shine from her eyes. \"I know it here—\" she touched her head—\"and here—\" she touched her bosom. And he was persuaded somehow that she was right, though his head told him she could not be, for cement and steel are cheaper and quicker, and only cheapness and rapidity obtain now that people no longer dream of to-morrow. And the soldier\u0027s honor and the sailor\u0027s courage, and the writer\u0027s fire and the builder\u0027s genius—yes, and the dreams of great merchants, too, Lovat grimaced—are curbed and roweled by the huckster\u0027s purse. Impossible! But somehow because she believed it, the thought took form and substance in his heart, that one day he would build a great bridge—of stone. How they came so close to each other, neither knew. It was just as natural as a tree growing out of the green ground. They came so close that they could be silent, each with the other, for a long time, each knowing, feeling what the other thought. Then they would smile at each other with a strange seriousness.... One afternoon, in the December dusk, his heart opened suddenly, and all, all the horror of his early years came rushing like a flood from a broken dam. Why he told her he didn\u0027t know. He didn\u0027t believe it possible to tell any one. Yet here he was, standing by the window of the drawing-room, looking out at the street glistening with fog, while she sat huddled in a great arm-chair by the log fire. And out of his lips in harsh staccato sentences came the sordidness of his infant days.... \"... We were pleased when we found it. And Joan took it under a shawl and went out. But we had forgotten that the pawnbroker closed at six. So there was nothing to eat until he should open in the morning.... We all cried....\" He was interrupted by her terrible fit of sobbing. Suddenly he came out of his tragic vision. \"I \u0027m sorry I should have horrified you,\" he said, aghast. \"I don\u0027t know what came over me to tell such things. I \u0027ll go.\" But she was in his arms, weeping bitterly. \"To think that you and I should have been in the same city! And I had everything, and you nothing. You hungry! Cold! Oh, Simon! Simon!\" Though they were as close as this, as close as birds in a nest are, yet there had never been between them any talk of marriage, any talk of life other than they were leading that week. He knew he loved her tremendously, but fear of refusal and Scots pride because he was poor kept the question in his heart. And she, because she was modest as she was brave, never said anything, though she knew, she knew... At last the miracle happened. Two South American commonwealths, with the hearts of children and the bravery of men, decided to span the Andes with an immense bridge. They saw only peaceful progress in front of them, not war. The bridge was to be of stone, because stone was plentiful and labor cheap, and to bring steel up the mountain gorge would be a wasteful undertaking. First a German architect was to have the work, for they had the foothold there, and then an Englishman stepped in confidently. But old Gamaliel Stanford had his friends in New York, heads of great fruit companies and immense agricultural-machinery syndicates, and banks powerful as nations. So Simon Lovat was chosen. When he and Cecily were told, he was dumb. She said nothing, but her shining eyes spoke, and she sat and watched the proud throw of his head as he thought of arches as powerful as the Romans\u0027, of great spans one hundred and fifty feet in width, of voussoirs weighing each eighty tons of stone. Suddenly he knew her eyes were showering him with joy and confidence, and he put out his hand fearfully. \"When this is done, Cecily—\" he was red as a school-boy—\"would you—could you—will you marry me?\" \"Whom else could I marry, dearest one?\" she answered simply. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3292/90008.html","bookId":459,"book":{"id":459,"title":"Changeling and Other Stories","description":"简介： When it comes to the publishing of books, people are always pessimistic, and, in my case, always right.
