{"id":21900,"no":2,"title":"CHANGELING Chapter 1","content":"To outward appearance the whole of the courtroom scene was drab, ordinary. There was the stuffy rectangle of a room, half dark in the January dusk, for all that the electric lights glowed with meager incandescence. There was the judge, in his robe, at the desk of the court. There were the jurymen, solemn as in church. There the court stenographers, bald, active as ants. There the men of the daily journals, more aloof, more judicial than the judge. There the press of morbid spectators, leaning forward like runners on the mark. There the policemen, court attendants, whatnot, relaxed of body, concentrated of eye, jealous of the dignity of the court as a house-dog of its master\u0027s home. Through the windows of the court could be seen the bulk of the Tombs, heavy, hopeless, horrible as the things whence it takes its chilly name. The case of the people versus Anna Janssen for the murder of Alastair de Vries droned on. The district attorney, youngish, slim, lithe, a little sinister—the impression of a hunting-dog all over him—was examining a witness, a rat-faced man who had something of the old-time bartender or private detective about him. \"It was your business, as attendant at the Oriental Garden, to see that order was kept?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"There was no semblance of disorder at all until you heard the shot fired?\" \"No, sir.\" \"Mr. De Vries was at a table with a party?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"You heard the shot and you saw Mr. De Vries fall forward?\" \"Yes, sir. Crumpled up, sort of.\" \"Then you ran to him?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"You saw the woman Janssen back of the hall with a revolver?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"What was she doing?\" \"She was laughing.\" \"Was she drunk?\" \"The laugh sounded drunk.\" \"Was she very much under the influence of liquor?\" \"She could n\u0027t have been, else she would n\u0027t have got away.\" \"You are certain that it was the prisoner?\" All eyes in the court-room were turned to the prisoner in the dock. And there was in the sordid trial chamber a sense of great disturbance in the air, though, from the minds and personalities of all gathered there, there rose in gray tendrils a haze of doubt, of disbelief, of mystery. She sat in the dock, in the sordid court-room, among the unseemly officers and the public, as a statue in some public square might stand above the rabble. Mature, magnificent, the prisoner seemed almost like some goddess from a Norse mythology. First, her strange coloring made all catch their breath. Her face was tanned to an absolutely golden hue, and out of this work of delicate bronze there looked, calm and confident, two eyes that were blue as sea-water. Her eyebrows, her hair, were bleached by the sun until her eyebrows were two half-moons of silver, until her hair was the pale, beautiful gold of honey in dark lights and like vivid strands of live silver when the light fell on it. She had the strange, exotic appearance of the women of Saba Isle, the ancient colony of Holland sailors and Carib Indian belles, a small dot in the West Indies where there is a town on the top of a mountain, and life is as in the garden of the Hesperides. It was not alone her coloring, her splendid face. From her there came such an aura of health, of spiritual strength, it seemed impossible that this woman was the chorus girl Janssen who had been the cast-off mistress of the rake and spendthrift De Vries, who had been drunk, who attended cabarets with wine-merchants and Broadway belles. This woman! Impossible! In her own calm eyes there seemed also a look that said more: \"This is ridiculous. I can\u0027t have done this. Why am I here? Why don\u0027t they get up and let me go?\" Even the rat-faced witness was perturbed. \"The prisoner in the dock?\" he said with a sense of puzzled wonder. \"The prisoner in the dock?\" \"Well, don\u0027t mind the prisoner in the dock, then. It was the woman Janssen you saw.\" \"I am sure of that.\" \"You were well acquainted with her appearance. You couldn\u0027t have been mistaken?\" \"No, sir, I could not have been mistaken. She was often at the Oriental with Mr. De Vries. Sometimes every night for a week. I could not have been mistaken. It was she shot Mr. De Vries.\" The district attorney sat down, with a gesture of his hand toward Howard Donegan, the prisoner\u0027s counsel. With his massive body, with his massive head, with his cruel jurist\u0027s face, Howard Donegan was as much a part of the attraction for the public as was the prisoner, the notoriety of the ten-year-old case, the romantic capture of Annette Janssen. The great Irish-American was the foremost criminal lawyer of his day, all but invincible when defending a man or a woman with the slightest chance of escape, and right on his side. As a cross-examiner he was dreaded as the plague. The public would get the thrill of seeing a superbly cruel and magnificent performance when Donegan arose. Even now the rat-faced witness shook as with ague as Donegan turned casually toward him, with hooded eyes. But Donegan shook his head. He did not wish to cross-examine. Even the judge was surprised. \"Did I hear aright?\" He leaned forward, his fine mystic\u0027s face in lines of doubt and worry. \"The counsel for the prisoner does not wish to cross-examine?\" \"Your Honor heard aright. I will not cross-examine.\" Through the big chamber there was a buzz of comment, of doubt, of all but horror. Was there nothing to be done for this woman? Even if she did kill De Vries, give her a sporting chance for her life! \"What is Donegan doing?\" the public, the attendants, the newspaper reporters asked themselves with mistrust. Was he throwing her down? There was a tensing in court, a tightening, as of drama. Already there was a sense in every one\u0027s chilled veins of the horrible harness of the electric chair. But Donegan only drowsed. \"You can step down,\" the Court told the witness. The rat-faced man crept from the witness-box, white, shaking still with the fear of Donegan\u0027s eye. He tried to get a seat in the benches, but none would make room for him. And though he had only done his duty, and that at command of the law, there was about him, as he slunk from the room, the look there was about him who was surnamed Iscariot, as he crept from the garden on the Mount of Olives, on the world\u0027s most tragic dawn.... Like a story from some old book there unrolled before the public the history of Anna Janssen of ten, or twelve, or fifteen years before, in a New York we know no longer, so changed is it in that brief space. Then it was a riotous spendthrift, a glorious waster, hell-roaring, somehow lovable, and now it is a burgess of standing, with all the burgess virtues. And the eyes of the court-room glistened as old names appeared like Falstaffian ghosts. The Poodle Dog, the German Village, the Holland House, the Knickerbocker. Gorgeous, blowsy, out of a dim past they rose for an instant. Baron Wilkins\u0027s and Nigger Mike\u0027s. And there was the thin clink of glasses across forgotten bars. And at three o\u0027clock of a morning the flying wedge at Pat\u0027s was hurling some truculent guest to the sidewalk. And gunmen were gunmen then, not strike-breakers. Old days, great days, and only a dozen years before. And John Barrymore was not Richard III but the comedian of \"Are You a Mason?\" And Mr. Chambers had written \"The Danger Mark,\" and Lieutenant Becker still patrolled the streets. And Mannie Chappelle and Diamond Jim were still alive and merry, who are now dust, God rest them! And cops grafted and politics were corrupt, after the old and pleasant tradition. And out of the side door of saloons came the old-fashioned drunkard, who with the old-fashioned ghost-story and the old-fashioned Christmas is laid to rest forevermore. And the voice of Dr. Parkhurst was heard through the land. Ichabod! Gone is glory! The night life of Paris was hectic, hysterical. The night life of Berlin was heavy, somehow sinister. But, lush, extravagant, now joyous, now macabre, the foam of New-World liquor, the night life of New York challenged the heavens with streaming rays, retiring only before the chaste, armored dawn. Like some Thousand and One Nights of some writer of the people, it challenged the imagination, it intrigued, it repelled. Overdone not seldom, often in bad taste, but virile, rude, and unabashed, it claimed recognition with brazen clamor. And on this stage, and against this background, now leading woman to De Vries, now being supported by a caste of wasters, brokers, men about town, there moved Anna Janssen, the Swedish Beauty. Cast in the form and figure of a Norse goddess, fit for great epics, she was a figurante in a debauched side-show. Her eyes, which were blue as the sea and should have been pure and passionate as the sea, were drenched with wine, and her mouth, with its clear-cut outlines as of a woman of the painter Zorn\u0027s, which should have been firm as a budding flower, was relaxed and wet from kissing. A woman of Broadway, hungered after and yet despised, she might have gone the accustomed path that leads from the chattering magnificence of Broadway to the sinister silence of Potter\u0027s Field. Down the old beaten decline toward sordid Death she could have gone, and none would have tried to stay her, none to help. And then the end. And the only result would have been a little chilling in the hearts of the newer Beauties of Broadway, a ghost whispering in their hearts the most terrible of epitaphs: The wages of sin is death. For a moment only. And some celebrity of Broadway might feel sad for an hour, with easy sentiment: \"Poor Anna! And I knew her when she wore diamonds, and New York was at her feet!\" Or some respectable citizen in his warm home might treasure secret, ashamed memories, and never avow them. And some one might even seek out her grave to say a hurried prayer and make an offering of flowers. And the rest would be silence. But that, in a mood of drunken pique, she shot and killed Alastair de Vries! Of her life there is little to be said. It is a life that a thousand girls have lived. Admit the evidence which satisfied a judge in a trial of murder and it boils down to this: The daughter of a Brooklyn mechanic, she got a place in the chorus of a big musical comedy, and was flattered and courted by the blades of Broadway. And the one to whom she fell victim was Alastair de Vries, who had forsaken Fifth Avenue to travel westward to Broadway. Of the old patroon stock which had settled New Amsterdam and been lords of the manor along the Hudson before the English came, bankers and traders, soldiers and explorers, all there remained of them was one moneyed boy who saw adventure only in ruining the daughters of tradesmen where his forebears had seen it in hacking out the destiny of a New World. Blond, rather chubby, not yet thirty, Alastair de Vries had already had a large biography in the Sunday papers and weeklies of gossip in New York. Annette Janssen was one of perhaps twenty conquests and she was not the last. She was the all but last. He took her from the chorus, gave her everything she desired, made her for her brief life the semiannual queen of Broadway. And then a small brunette came along, acclaimed as the Queen of the Ponies, and, turning like a flash, De Vries hurried to conquer the new arrival. And Anna shot him, not because of jealousy, not because she loved him, but just to make trouble. There\u0027s her life for you. There are what the dazzling facts of her queendom of Broadway amount to. There they are, without their glitter and romance. Through the black magic of Sinister Alley they shine like fireflies, but, like fireflies, in the calm sanity of daytime they are nothing but grubby crawling things we flick from our palms with a moue of distaste.... Day followed day, and witness witness, and item by item the sordid chronicle was written. Each fact attested and proved to the satisfaction of the court, to the satisfaction of the public. It was a sort of journey toward a definite objective—a journey on which the public was invited to see Justice hearken to the call of the people of the State of New York. There was no doubt about it. Coldly, callously, for a whim, in a moment of piqued vanity, a chorus girl had shot a gentleman. And then in the mind of every one there loomed, as it approached nearer until its horrible lines, its terrifying aura were visible, the objective of the voyage—the dreadful electric chair. \"Why does n\u0027t Donegan do something? Why? Why? Why does n\u0027t he put up a fight at least?\" But Donegan drowsed on. Only when the prisoner in the dock threw him a swift look of appeal, as she did occasionally when some damning point was raised, did he drop the granite mask. Now and then her face would blanch under the tan, and her mouth quiver. And then would come a miracle in Donegan. Those harsh bulldog features would relax, the glinting eyes open, and over the hated face would play the smile of—oh, forty years ago—when he was just an innocent, likable Irish boy, and not a great jurist, whom communion with the sinister qualities of the law, and battles for life and liberty, and knowledge of strange strata in the minds of men, which is good for none to know, had transformed into a dark angel with a protective and flaming sword. But the smile did n\u0027t reassure the public. \"Yes, he \u0027s smiling. He \u0027s confident, all right. But why does n\u0027t he do something?\" Had the people in the court-room read of this trial in their homes—read the bare facts, the testimony of witnesses, there was not one who would have wasted a second thought on Anna Janssen. Perhaps in the hearts of one or two there would have lingered the feeling that it was not right she should be strapped horribly in the chair. But that would have been chivalry, not justice. One and all would have said: \"That is what the death penalty is for—to remove from human contact one who has no right to God\u0027s sunshine, and who has arrogated to her vile and puny self the right of the Creator, the disposal of human life. Muffle her up. Hustle her away. Throw on the current and hide her in quicklime. Life is not for such as she!\" But between the woman whom the witnesses had drawn in black, sinister colors and the lady in the dock there was a continent of difference. True, she was the same height, the same figure, but for a healthy development of years. True, such marks of identification as Anna Janssen the chorus girl had, might be noted on the body of her who was a prisoner at the bar. But the body of Anna Janssen the chorus girl was soft and white and made for sinister loving, while that of the woman in the dock was healthy and hard and tanned, after the fashion of Eve, whom the Lord God made in the garden. And Anna Janssen\u0027s had swayed alluringly with provocative sophistication, while the carriage of this woman was erect and of great dignity. And the eyes of the chorus girl had been full of evil knowledge and unhealthy flame, but this woman\u0027s had wistfulness and a strange mystery. And in the heart of every one there rose a cry: \"This is not the same woman. This is a good woman!\" There is a theory of an old medical school whose name—not that it matters—I regret to have forgotten. And it is this: that every seven years the human body changes. We have not the same bones, nor the same skin, the same muscles at thirty-five that we had at twenty-eight. They are worn out and are eliminated, and new tissue takes their place. It may be wrong, but it is a very taking theory. It explains to us how the track athlete of some years ago becomes the paunchy, bald-headed, repulsive man of to-day. It explains how the well-fed man of the world may turn into a harsh-faced monk. It explains to us how the soft, succubine chorus girl of a dozen years before became the splendid amazon that Anna Janssen is to-day. And yet this may be wrong about the body. But about the mind (and there you have the inner person) there is one thing certain, not a theory but a fact—that people change completely. Like a child\u0027s slate, the mind is, on which a thousand things are written. The young take so much for granted; the old know. And gallantly they write this for a fact, that for a falsehood. But day by day they live and learn, as the old saw goes. And simple equations become quadratic. And the writing on the slate is altered month by month, as new factors of life are realized. All is a correction, a readjustment. This is gradual, but occasionally, very occasionally, by some mental or spiritual cataclysm all on the slate is sponged clear. And a new and startling departure takes its place. As we see in the inner personality of Anna Janssen the change from the petty arithmetic of Broadway, the venal crooked sums of Sinister Street, to the gigantic calculus of life as the Lord God conceived it, when He formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.... The district attorney turned from his last witness to the twelve men in the box. \"Gentlemen,\" he said, in the manner of a workman well satisfied with the progress of the job in hand, \"I have proved the crime and proved the perpetrator, the circumstances, the setting, the motive. There is but one more thing to be done to clinch this case home like a nail in a horse\u0027s shoe. It is now ten years between the time this murder was committed and the bringing of the prisoner to the bar of justice. There is but one more thing to do to remove the smallest iota of doubt that the prisoner at the bar and Anna Janssen, Alastair de Vries\u0027s mistress, are one and the same person. And to prove this I shall call to the witness-stand the detective who arrested Anna Janssen in Tahiti, and in whose custody the prisoner has been from that day until she was brought to justice here—a period of nine years and four months in all.\" \"Officer Thomas McCarthy!\" \"Officer Thomas McCarthy to the stand.\" The public craned forward, and with that strange shifting sound that betokens an immensity of interest they settled themselves in their seats for the recital of the detective. Here was the great attraction of the trial—the story of McCarthy and Anna Janssen alone on a desert island, a murderess and the officer who arrested her. More than the morbid interest of the killing of De Vries, more than the realistic tale of old New York that was, more than the spectacle of a woman dicing for her life, more than the prospect of watching Donegan, the greatest of criminal lawyers, harass the court, and pound the battered witnesses, and at last possibly and probably carry off the prisoner as in an old-time rescue from Tyburn, was the promised recital of the adventure in the lonely Southern sea. There had been one romantic story of it in one day of the papers, and then no more, for the matter would have called forth intense comment from the papers, arousing sympathy or hatred, and the case was sub judice. But that one story stirred the imagination of the public. And the sordid tale told of a woman killing her fickle lover in an attack of offended vanity faded into a golden haze of romance. The scented smell of the tropics came to their nostrils, and their eyes saw golden sands and phosphorescent seas. And here the palms murmured with a rustle as of exotic silks, and the Bird of Paradise winged its iridescent flight through the opaque Marquesan dusk. And the spirits of strange gods moved upon the face of the waters.... Here was a setting for Scheherazade and here characters for a master writer: a patrolman of New York, young, athletic, unspoiled, canny with the knowledge of his native city, brave as only his kind is brave; and here a woman from the sloughs of the Tenderloin, an admitted beauty, a proven murderess. What drama had happened in that isle of dreams, in that immense act of nine rolling years? And did she love him, or did she hate him? And had he succumbed to her, as Adam to Lilith in Eden, before Eve was? Or had he resisted her as Anthony of Egypt resisted the succuba in the desert near Fayum? And did she wheedle him with words sweeter than honey? Or did she curse him with strange black blasphemies? Or was it just one long, dumb vigil of hatred? Or had they become friends, hunter and hunted, marooned now on the islands of strange dead gods? In God\u0027s name, what? At any rate they would soon know. \"Officer Thomas McCarthy, this way!\" Then, of a sudden, up rose Howard Donegan. The judge on his bench, the jurymen, the prosecuting attorney, the court, the prisoner herself, all looked at him with a hesitant surprise. Somehow his action was surprisingly dramatic. He stood up slowly and said nothing, but looked around. Into the drama of crime and romance, there was injected a new element, powerful, sluggish, but immensely sure. \"If it please the Court,\" went his heavy, significant voice, \"may I say a few words?\" \"It is hardly regular, at this period, Mr. Donegan,\" the judge said, puzzled. \"Surely you will have an opportunity later on.\" \"The opportunity is opportune only now.\" Like some strange gargoyle in an old cathedral the great animal appeared. His eyes, under their threatening hoods, were black and beady like the eyes of some malevolent creature of the jungle. His mouth, a wide, thin slit, pouted like the mouth of a fish. His sedentary body was massive and grotesque like some monster of a mad artist\u0027s drawing. His voice creaked like unoiled machinery. But—God!—what power was there! \"Your Honor, men of the jury, and Mr. District Attorney, at any point I could have obstructed the course of this trial until all of you were weary in your chairs. I could have obfuscated facts and motives and testimony until you were as uncertain of truth as Pilate. The woman Wilkins—I could have shown that her word was no more to be depended on than the word of the village idiot. Mr. Howland Christy, De Vries\u0027s relative—I could have shaken him on the stand until he would have been uncertain of his testimony, for he is an honest man. And the usher of the cabaret—if I had concentrated on him, I could have made that whisky-sodden brain, that broken will, contradict everything he had said. \"But I did none of these things. I made no haze of doubt out of honest facts. For why? Because these facts are true. I grant them freely!\" There were a rustle and a murmur in the room. The public was suddenly aghast. What was this from Donegan? Treachery? Who ever heard of a counsel granting things like that? Good Lord! what was the man doing? The murmuring went on in spite of the judge\u0027s gavel, the attendants\u0027 cries. Donegan swept the room with his black, minatory glance, and the murmuring died. \"Your Honor, Mr. District Attorney, men of the jury, a crime is not an instantaneous action. What goes before a crime is important, and not less important is what follows it. Has the affair been brooded over, or has it been the result of momentary passion, and has the deed been regarded with smug satisfaction, or with quaking horror? \"And what effect has this had on the prisoner, on the world, on its time? So many things have to be taken into consideration when we are adjudging the crime. \"Gentlemen, the law and legal procedure are as easy to comprehend as a child\u0027s primer. The office of the district attorney is to see that a malefactor is brought to justice. The office of the jury is to decide whether that action was or was not done. The object of the judge is to weigh, decide, and in the name of the people say what shall be done with a member of the community who has hurt the interests of the community by his or her action. The duty of the counsel for the prisoner is to see that his client is not traduced by false witnesses, nor his or her liberty endangered by unfacts. \"But the object of all in the court-room is to see that justice is done, though the heavens crumble. \"I have examined no witnesses. I shall examine none. But I ask this in the latitude of the Court, and in the name of that Justice whose servants we one and all are, as much myself, advocate for the prisoner, as the district attorney for the people of the State of New York, as the jury in the box, as the judge on his bench: that the next witness, Thomas McCarthy, shall be allowed to tell his own story in his own way, relating facts which may not seem germane to the case, but which I claim are as pertinent as the pistol with which the crime was committed or the corpus delicti itself. I ask this of the Court and I request the Court so to direct.\" \"This is hardly regular, Mr. Donegan.\" \"I ask this in the name of Justice!\" \"This is a court of Justice, Mr. Donegan.\" The judge\u0027s manner had a slight rebuke. \"But if the district attorney is agreeable—\" The district attorney, a little nettled, but rather awed before the tremendous purpose of Donegan, shrugged his shoulders. \"Very well, Mr. Donegan,\" the judge nodded. \"The district attorney—\" Donegan addressed the jury—\"is calling Thomas McCarthy to prove the identity of Anna Janssen. He is an officer of the City of New York, a witness for the State of New York. The attorney has called him to prove that the prisoner in the dock is Anna Janssen. I shall not examine him. But when he has given his testimony for the district attorney he will have given his testimony for me. \"And I shall have proven that the chorus girl who killed Alastair de Vries is not the woman who stands in the dock!\" There was an instant\u0027s sighing from the courtroom, a momentary relaxation. So Donegan had fought and won his first fight, and now they were going to hear the History of the Spicy Isles. Now all the mystery would be lifted that had been hanging about the court-room like a necromancer\u0027s mist. \"Call Thomas McCarthy!\" Donegan barked from the side of his mouth. \"Officer Thomas McCarthy.\" \"Thomas McCarthy to the stand!\" As he stood in the witness-box, McCarthy seemed to bulk tremendously in the room. As Anna Janssen seemed to fill the court spiritually, so he seemed to fill it physically. Emanations of strength, emanations of power came from him like current from a battery. He was not six feet tall, but so erect did he stand, so free was his carriage that he seemed to tower above all in the court-room. He was not a big man, but he suggested tremendous strength, so easily with the smallest movement did the sinews ripple beneath his coat. Brown as copper, his face had not the strange mystery of Anna Janssen\u0027s, because his eyes and hair were black, where hers were fair. Yet he was strange. It was principally that he was out of place in his city clothes. One could have imagined him easily as some young athlete in the Olympic games, hurling the discus possibly, or flinging himself over the high jump. Or one might have suffered him in the clothes of summer in the country, soft rolling collar and roomy sport coat. But in the \"business suit\" of some department-store, he seemed like an actor some inept stage manager had dressed. Grotesquely, a police badge was pinned to the lapel of his coat. As he entered the box, Anna Janssen turned toward him with a swift outpouring of her eyes. It might have been interest, but it was warmer than interest. It might have been appeal, but it was more confident than appeal. \"You are plain-clothes officer Thomas McCarthy?\" the district attorney examined. \"Yes, sir. Number eight thousand nine hundred and seventeen.\" \"Attached to police headquarters?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Tell us the circumstances under which you arrested the prisoner.\" \"The Commissioner—the Commissioner—\" McCarthy began, faltered, suddenly stopped. \"Yes, the Commissioner.\" But McCarthy seemed struck by sudden panic. \"Yes, yes!\" the district attorney became irritable. \"The Commissioner—\" He rapped the table. Donegan rose. \"McCarthy,\" he explained gently, \"has had no one to talk to for seven years but my client. He finds it hard to get his words right. Take your time, McCarthy,\" he told the witness. \"Close your eyes. Say it as if you were saying it to yourself.\" The prisoner threw him a look of gratitude. \"I was on the vice squad under Inspector O\u0027Gara.\" The witness found words at last. \"One morning the Commissioner sends for me. It was when the trouble was on about the graft in the Raines-law hotels. The Commissioner looks at me kind of hard. \"\u0027Are you on the square, McCarthy?\u0027 he says. \"\u0027Yes, Commissioner, I \u0027m on the square,\u0027 I tells him. \"\u0027It\u0027s news to me they \u0027s any one on the square,\u0027 the Commissioner laughs kind o\u0027 mean. \"\u0027Tell me, McCarthy, were you ever mixed up with a woman?\u0027 I gets chilled all over, because I thinks some one\u0027s trying to frame me. \"\u0027No, sir. Never,\u0027 I answers. \"\u0027Then why were n\u0027t you?\u0027 \"\u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 I says, \u0027except it was my people were from Ireland and brought me up their own way. When I was a kid, Commissioner, I could go to confession without holding out, and I guess I can do it to-day.\u0027 \"\u0027Oh, you \u0027re one of them good Irish cops,\u0027 he sneers. \u0027I heard tell on them, but I never met one before.\u0027 \"\u0027Well, you meet him now.\u0027 I looks him cold in the eye. And then I \u0027m sorry, because I sees he means nothing. He \u0027s just sore. \"\u0027Well, square cop,\u0027 he says, \u0027I got a job for you. Anna Janssen,\u0027 he says, \u0027is found. A rich guy hides her and brings her to Tahiti on his yacht. She\u0027s there now. The French authorities,\u0027 he says, \u0027have made a pinch. Go get her.\u0027 \"\u0027All right,\u0027 I says, and turns to go. \"\u0027Just a moment, McCarthy,\u0027 he says. \u0027I said: \"Get her.\" You understand? Get her. And keep her. Was a man to try and escape on you, what would you do?\u0027 \"\u0027I \u0027d shoot,\u0027 I says. \u0027I \u0027d bring him in, alive or dead.\u0027 \"\u0027Well, shoot her.\u0027 \"\u0027Oh, gee, Chief!\u0027 I says. \u0027I can\u0027t shoot a woman.\u0027 \"\u0027Well, then, shoot yourself,\u0027 he says. \u0027At any rate, if you come home alone, come home cold storage. I \u0027ll pay the freight. And that \u0027ll be all,\u0027 he says. \"I goes to Paris, and from Paris to Marseilles—\" \"That\u0027s all right, McCarthy,\" the district attorney waived. \"It does n\u0027t matter how you went. Tell us what happened at Tahiti.\" \"In Tahiti something tells me all is not right. The steamer I come on docks in the morning and leaves that afternoon, and I hopes to make it with Janssen. Maybe it\u0027s because I can\u0027t get their French and our consul is not a well man, but they delay me until the steamer goes and then I \u0027m left flat. The extradition papers must be in order, they say. But there is too much of this belle-prisoner stuff. \"Well, all\u0027s finished and they takes me to her. \u0027Well, Janssen,\u0027 I says, \u0027we got you.\u0027 \u0027Now that you got me, what are you going to do with me?\u0027 she laughs; and every one laughs. Right away I see they \u0027re all rooting for her, and they like me like a souse likes water. \"Honest, Judge, I don\u0027t blame them. They\u0027s few white women in that place and, such as they are, they \u0027re not lookers. And the Kanaka girls, for all they are pretty as a picture, they ain\u0027t human and they ain\u0027t healthy, you know, as we white people think. Anna certainly had the looks, and was white, and had the pep, and they were all crazy about her. The Frenchmen are daffy about women, and they don\u0027t think nothing about a woman shooting a man—nothing at all. \"So they smiles at me and they says, \u0027You must see our beautiful island before you sail away with the belle prisoner!\u0027 \"\u0027Your island is fine,\u0027 I tells them, \u0027and, no offense meant, but it\u0027s got nothing on Manhattan Island. And as for the belle prisoner,\u0027 I says, \u0027ain\u0027t you folks forgetting something? This dame is as nifty a little murderess as ever I sees.\u0027 \"\u0027It was a crime passional,\u0027 they says, and they shrugs their shoulders. \"\u0027Tell that to the judge,\u0027 I says. \u0027I \u0027m only the copper.\u0027 \"\u0027Well,\u0027 they say, \u0027unfortunately Monsieur will have to enjoy our island for three weeks. The next liner will not be here until then.\u0027 \"\u0027Oh, is that so?\u0027 I laughs. \u0027Well, let me tell you something. While you guys was examining the papers for your belle prisoner, I was doing a little scouting around the harbor. And they\u0027s a schooner leaving to-night for San Francisco. I guess that \u0027ll do us all right.\u0027 \"\u0027Impossible!\u0027 They go wild. \u0027A lady cannot travel—\u0027 \"\u0027Cut the lady stuff,\u0027 I says. \u0027She\u0027s my prisoner.\u0027 \"She was a trading schooner, dealing in copra, oranges, cotton, mother-of-pearl, and such like, but once she must have been a fine yacht. There were state-rooms still aboard her, though now they were filled with junk for trading, but I made a deal with the captain and he cleans one out and fixes it up for Janssen. And then I takes Janssen down to the docks. \"Judge, you\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 thought she\u0027d saved the country instead of killing De Vries, the way they acted about that woman. They lined up on the docks of Papeete, all the men and a good many women, too. And they sang and they danced and they said good-by. \u0027When you get off, come back,\u0027 they says to her. They got on my nerves so much, I had all I could do not to laugh dirty, when they says that about getting off. \"Janssen looks at the boat, and looks at the people. And she goes crazy-mad. \u0027Damn you, damn you!\u0027 She turns on me. \u0027Only for you, I \u0027d not be going back!\u0027 \"\u0027Yeh, only for me,\u0027 I says, \u0027you would n\u0027t have killed De Vries. It\u0027s all my fault, hey? Now, listen to me, Janssen. You \u0027re my prisoner, and my prisoner you \u0027ll remain. You had the game; now pay up, and stop hollering. You and I are from the same town, and I know you. You ought to know me a little better. I would n\u0027t have been sent for you if I had n\u0027t been able to take care of myself. All your French friends won\u0027t save you from a New York cop, once he \u0027s out to get you. You \u0027re beat, Janssen,\u0027 I tells her; \u0027you might as well give in.\u0027 \"She looks at me a long time. \"\u0027I \u0027m not beat yet,\u0027 she says. \"The captain tells us he\u0027s going to stop at Nukahivo and a few other islands to take cargo aboard. He \u0027s an old guy and sensible, and Janssen plays up to him to beat the band, so I takes no risks and keeps close. Even if he is an old guy and has n\u0027t any ambition, still and all, nobody likes a copper, and every one hates to see a prisoner taken home, especially if it\u0027s a woman. So I give Janssen and him no chance for private conversation. Once clear of the islands, I think, and all will be well. Janssen sees my game. \"\u0027You don\u0027t give me much chance with the old fellow.\u0027 \"\u0027No, ma\u0027am,\u0027 I laughs. \u0027That\u0027s your business. I give you no chance. You \u0027re beat, Janssen. What\u0027s the use of fooling yourself?\u0027 \"\u0027Oh, I \u0027ve still got an ace in the hole. I \u0027m not beat yet!\u0027 \"She turns in early. \u0027I suppose you \u0027re going to lock the door?\u0027 she asks me. \"\u0027What\u0027s the use? They\u0027s other keys. The islands are near at hand, and they could put you off in a boat. I \u0027m not going to lock the door,\u0027 I tells her, \u0027but I \u0027m going to sleep outside it, up against it. It opens out, and the smallest movement will wake me up. You \u0027re beat.\u0027 \"\u0027All right! I \u0027m beat,\u0027 she says, and she turns in. \"I puts myself against the door, and falls asleep on the deck. It might have been ten minutes after it, but it was really hours, the door opens. It\u0027s the middle of the night, for the stars are high, and there \u0027s nothing to be seen, and the waves keep lapping the bow of the schooner and she dips pretty like a cantering horse. And suddenly I \u0027m awake and lonely and wet with dew. I looks up and there \u0027s Janssen above me, big and handsome and her eyes like the stars. \"\u0027You \u0027re not comfortable there, McCarthy,\u0027 she whispers. \"\u0027I can\u0027t say as I \u0027m on a bed of roses,\u0027 I tells her. \"\u0027Why don\u0027t you come inside?\u0027 \"\u0027I don\u0027t know what you mean,\u0027 I says. \"\u0027Never mind what I mean,\u0027 she laughs. \u0027Come on in.\u0027 \"\u0027I think I \u0027ll stay where I am,\u0027 I says kind of short. \"\u0027I \u0027m not accustomed to having invitations like this refused.\u0027 There was a kind of jar in her voice. \"\u0027They \u0027s lots of things you \u0027re not accustomed to, you better get accustomed to right away,\u0027 I says. \u0027You \u0027re accustomed to fine hotels. Now you got to get used to the Tombs. You \u0027re accustomed to lying down on couches. Now you got to get accustomed to sitting up, very straight, in a chair at Sing Sing.\u0027 I did n\u0027t want to be brutal toward her, Judge, but I did n\u0027t want her to be making passes like that at me. \"What she says to me then I could n\u0027t tell, Judge. But she closes the door with a slam and leaves me be. \"I notices the wind is getting kind o\u0027 high, and that when the schooner pitches she sort of jars, and that under the green light on the starboard sight of the boat the water is rushing past very quick. The boat is lying over and the sailors pass me quick as lightning and in the cordage the air is whining like a broken fiddle-string, but over it all I can hear Janssen cursing in her cabin, cursing just like the \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3292/89996.html","bookId":459,"book":{"id":459,"title":"Changeling and Other Stories","description":"简介： When it comes to the publishing of books, people are always pessimistic, and, in my case, always right.
