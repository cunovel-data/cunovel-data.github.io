{"id":108323,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"\"I heard someone get hurt - Kristie needs me more than Raoul,\" he explained quickly. \"Are you... leaving us?\" Riley\u0027s face changed. It was like I could see his shifting tactics written on his features. His eyes widened, suddenly anxious. \"I\u0027m worried, Bree. I told you that she was going to meet us, to help us, but I haven\u0027t crossed her trail. Something\u0027s wrong. I need to find her.\" \"But there\u0027s no way you can find her before Raoul gets to the yel ow-eyes,\" I pointed out. \"I have to find out what\u0027s going on.\" He sounded genuinely desperate. \"I need her. I wasn\u0027t supposed to do this alone!\" \"But the others...\" \"Bree, I have to go find her! Now! There are enough of you to overwhelm the yel ow-eyes. I\u0027l get back to you as soon as I can.\" He sounded so sincere. I hesitated, glancing back the way we had come. Fred would be halfway to Vancouver by now. Riley hadn\u0027t even asked about him. Maybe Fred\u0027s talent was stil in effect. \"Diego\u0027s down there, Bree,\" Riley said urgently. \"He\u0027l be part of the first attack. Didn\u0027t you catch his scent back there? Did you not get close enough?\" I shook my head, total y confused. \"Diego was there?\" \"He\u0027s with Raoul by now. If you hurry, you can help him get out alive.\" We stared at each other for a long second, and then I looked south after Raoul\u0027s path. \"Good girl,\" Riley said. \"I\u0027l go find her and we\u0027l be back to help clean up. You guys have got this! It might be over by the time you get there!\" He took off in a direction perpendicular to our original path. I clenched my teeth at how sure he seemed of his way. Lying to the end. But it didn\u0027t feel like I had a choice. I headed south in a flatout sprint again. I had to go get Diego. Drag him away if it came to that. We could catch up with Fred. Or take off on our own. We needed to run. I would tel Diego how Riley had lied. He would see that Riley had no intention of helping us fight the battle he\u0027d set up. There was no reason to help him anymore. I found the human\u0027s scent and then Raoul\u0027s. I didn\u0027t catch Diego\u0027s. Was I going too fast? Or was the human\u0027s scent just overpowering me? Half my head was absorbed in this strangely counterproductive hunt - sure, we would find the girl, but would we be ready to fight together when we did? No, we\u0027d be clawing each other apart to get to her. And then I heard the snarling and screaming and screeching explode from ahead and I knew the fight was happening and I was too late to beat Diego there. I only ran faster. Maybe I could stil save him. I smel ed the smoke - the sweet, thick scent of vampires burning - carried back to me on the wind. The sound of mayhem was louder. Maybe it was almost done. Would I find our coven victorious and Diego waiting? I dashed through a heavy fringe of smoke and found myself out of the forest in a huge grassy field. I leaped over a rock, only to realize in the instant I flew past it that it was a headless torso. My eyes raked the field. There were pieces of vampires everywhere, and a huge bonfire smoking purple into the sunny sky. Out from under the bil owing haze, I could see dazzling, glittering bodies darting and grappling as the sounds of vampires being torn apart went on and on. I looked for one thing: Diego\u0027s curly black hair. No one I could see had hair so dark. There was one huge vampire with brown hair that was almost black, but he was too big, and as I focused I watched him tear Kevin\u0027s head off and pitch it into the fire before leaping on someone else\u0027s back. Was that Jen? There was another with straight black hair that was too smal to be Diego. That one was moving so fast I couldn\u0027t tel if it was a boy or a girl. I scanned quickly again, feeling horribly exposed. I took in the faces. There weren\u0027t nearly enough vampires here, even counting those that were down. I didn\u0027t see any of Kristie\u0027s group. There must have been a lot of vampires burned already. Most of the vampires stil standing were strangers. A blond vampire glanced at me, meeting my gaze, and his eyes flashed gold in the sunlight. We were losing. Bad. I started backing toward the trees, not moving fast enough because I was stil looking for Diego. He wasn\u0027t here. There was no sign he had ever been here. No trace of his scent, though I could distinguish the smel s of most of Raoul\u0027s team and many strangers. I had made myself look at the pieces, too. None of them belonged to Diego. I would have recognized even a finger. I turned and real y ran for the trees, suddenly positive that Diego\u0027s presence here was just another of Riley\u0027s lies. And if Diego wasn\u0027t here, then he was already dead. This fel into place for me so easily that I thought I must have known the truth for a while. Since the moment that Diego had not fol owed Riley through the basement door. He\u0027d already been gone. I was a few feet into the trees when a force like a wrecking bal hit me from behind and threw me to the ground. An arm slipped under my chin. \"Please!\" I sobbed. And I meant please kill me fast. The arm hesitated. I didn\u0027t fight back, though my instincts were urging me to bite and claw and rip the enemy apart. The saner part of me knew that wasn\u0027t going to work. Riley had lied about these weak, older vampires, too, and we\u0027d never had a chance. But even if I\u0027d had a way to beat this one, I wouldn\u0027t have been able to move. Diego was gone, and that glaring fact kil ed the fight in me. Suddenly I was airborne. I crashed into a tree and crumpled to the ground. I should have tried to run, but Diego was dead. I couldn\u0027t get around that. The blond vampire from the clearing was staring intently at me, his body ready to spring. He looked very capable, much more experienced than Riley. But he wasn\u0027t lunging at me. He wasn\u0027t crazed like Raoul or Kristie. He was total y in control. \"Please,\" I said again, wanting him to get this over with. \"I don\u0027t want to fight.\" Though he stil held himself ready, his face changed. He looked at me in a way I didn\u0027t total y get. There was a lot of knowledge in that face, and something else. Empathy? Pity, at least. \"Neither do I, child,\" he said in a calm, kind voice. \"We are only defending ourselves.\" There was such honesty in his odd yel ow eyes that it made me wonder how I had ever believed any of Riley\u0027s stories. I felt... guilty. Maybe this coven had never planned to attack us in Seattle. How could I trust any part of what I\u0027d been told? \"We didn\u0027t know,\" I explained, somehow ashamed. \"Riley lied. I\u0027m sorry.\" He listened for a moment, and I realized that the battlefield was quiet. It was over. If I\u0027d been in any doubt over who the winner was, that doubt was gone when, a second later, a female vampire with wavy brown hair and yel ow eyes hurried to his side. \"Carlisle?\" she asked in a confused voice, staring at me. \"She doesn\u0027t want to fight,\" he told her. The woman touched his arm. He was stil tensed to spring. \"She\u0027s so frightened, Carlisle. Couldn\u0027t we...\" The blond, Carlisle, glanced back at her, and then he straightened up a little, though I could see he was stil wary. \"We have no wish to harm you,\" the woman said to me. She had a soft, soothing voice. \"We didn\u0027t want to fight any of you.\" \"I\u0027m sorry,\" I whispered again. I couldn\u0027t make sense of the mess in my head. Diego was dead, and that was the main thing, the devastating thing. Other than that, the fight was over, my coven had lost and my enemies had won. But my dead coven was ful of people who would have loved to watch me burn, and my enemies were speaking to me kindly when they had no reason to. Moreover, I felt safer with these two strangers than I\u0027d ever felt with Raoul and Kristie. I was relieved that Raoul and Kristie were dead. It was so confusing. \"Child,\" Carlisle said, \"wil you surrender to us? If you do not try to harm us, we promise we wil not harm you.\" And I believed him. \"Yes,\" I whispered. \"Yes, I surrender. I don\u0027t want to hurt anybody.\" He held out his hand encouragingly. \"Come, child. Let our family regroup for a moment, then we\u0027l have some questions for you. If you answer honestly, you have nothing to fear.\" I got up slowly, making no movements that could be considered threatening. \"Carlisle?\" a male voice cal ed. And then another yel ow-eyed vampire joined us. Any sort of safety I\u0027d felt with these strangers vanished as soon as I saw him. He was blond, like the first, but tal er and leaner. His skin was absolutely covered in scars, spaced most thickly together on his neck and jaw. A few smal marks on his arm were fresh, but the rest were not from the brawl today. He had been in more fights than I could have imagined, and he\u0027d never lost. His tawny eyes blazed and his stance exuded the barely contained violence of an angry lion. As soon as he saw me he coiled to spring. \"Jasper!\" Carlisle warned. Jasper pul ed up short and stared at Carlisle with wide eyes. \"What\u0027s going on?\" \"She doesn\u0027t want to fight. She\u0027s surrendered.\" The scarred vampire\u0027s brow clouded, and suddenly I felt an unexpected surge of frustration, though I had no idea what I was frustrated with. \"Carlisle, I...\" He hesitated, then continued, \"I\u0027m sorry, but that\u0027s not possible. We can\u0027t have any of these newborns associated with us when the Volturi come. Do you realize the danger that would put us in?\" I didn\u0027t understand exactly what he was saying, but I got enough. He wanted to kil me. \"Jasper, she\u0027s only a child,\" the woman protested. \"We can\u0027t just murder her in cold blood!\" It was strange to hear her speak like we both were people, like murder was a bad thing. An avoidable thing. \"It\u0027s our family on the line here, Esme. We can\u0027t afford to have them think we broke this rule.\" The woman, Esme, walked between me and the one who wanted to kil me. Incomprehensibly, she turned her back to me. \"No. I won\u0027t stand for it.\" Carlisle shot me an anxious glance. I could see that he cared a lot for this woman. I would have looked the same way at anyone behind Diego\u0027s back. I tried to appear as docile as I felt. \"Jasper, I think we have to take the chance,\" he said slowly. \"We are not the Volturi. We fol ow their rules, but we do not take lives lightly. We wil explain.\" \"They might think we created our own newborns in defense.\" \"But we didn\u0027t. And even had we, there was no indiscretion here, only in Seattle. There is no law against creating vampires if you control them.\" \"This is too dangerous.\" Carlisle touched Jasper\u0027s shoulder tentatively. \"Jasper. We cannot kil this child.\" Jasper glowered at the man with the kind eyes, and I was suddenly angry. Surely he wouldn\u0027t hurt this gentle vampire or the woman he loved. Then Jasper sighed, and I knew it was okay. My anger evaporated. \"I don\u0027t like this,\" he said, but he was calmer. \"At least let me take charge of her. You two don\u0027t know how to deal with someone who\u0027s been running wild so long.\" \"Of course, Jasper,\" the woman said. \"But be kind.\" Jasper rol ed his eyes. \"We need to be with the others. Alice said we don\u0027t have long.\" Carlisle nodded. He held his hand out to Esme, and they headed past Jasper back toward the open field. \"You there,\" Jasper said to me, his face a glower again.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-short-second-life-of-bree-tanner-twilight-4/page-15.html","bookId":2028,"book":{"id":2028,"title":"The Short Second Life of Bree Tanner (Twilight #4)","description":"Storyline: The Short Second Life of Bree Tanner is a companion novella to the Twilight series by author Stephenie Meyer.
