{"id":108319,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"Before I could process this, Riley roared out an animalistic shriek of rage. He was staring down at the ashy remains on the floor, his eyes bulging in fury. Everyone stood silent, immobile. We\u0027d al seen Riley lose his temper, but this was something different. Riley spun and raked his fingers through a blaring speaker, then ripped it from the wal and hurled it across the room. Jen and Kristie dodged out of the way as it exploded into the far wal, sending up a cloud of pulverized drywal dust. Riley smashed the sound system with his foot, and the thudding bass went silent. Then he leaped to where Raoul stood, and grabbed him by the throat. \"I wasn\u0027t even here!\" Raoul yel ed, looking afraid - I\u0027d never seen that before. Riley growled hideously and threw Raoul as he\u0027d thrown the speaker. Jen and Kristie jumped out of the way again. Raoul\u0027s body crashed right through the wal, leaving an enormous hole. Riley caught Kevin by the shoulder and - with a familiar screech - ripped off his right hand. Kevin cried out in pain and tried to twist out of Riley\u0027s grip. Riley kicked him in the side. Another harsh shriek and Riley had the rest of Kevin\u0027s arm. He tore the arm in half at the elbow and threw the pieces hard into Kevin\u0027s anguished face - smack, smack, smack, like a hammer striking stone. \"What is wrong with you?\" Riley screamed at us. \"Why are you al so stupid?\" He made a grab for the blond Spider-Man kid, but that kid leaped out of his way. His jump left him too close to Fred, and he stumbled back toward Riley again, gagging. \"Do any of you have a brain?\" Riley smacked a kid named Dean into the entertainment center, shattering it, then caught another girl - Sara - and tore her left ear and a handful of hair from her head. She snarled in anguish. It became suddenly obvious that Riley was doing a very dangerous thing. There were a lot of us in here. Already Raoul was back, with Kristie and Jen - usual y his enemies - flanking him defensively. A few others banded together in clusters around the room. I wasn\u0027t sure if Riley was aware of the threat or if his rant came to an end natural y. He took a deep breath. He tossed Sara her ear and the hair. She recoiled away from him, licking the torn edge of her ear, coating it with venom so that it would reattach. There was no remedy for the hair, though; Sara was going to have a bald spot. \"Listen to me!\" Riley said, quiet but fierce. \"Al our lives depend on you listening to what I\u0027m saying now and thinking! We are al going to die. Every one of us, you and me, too, if you can\u0027t act like you have brains for just a few short days!\" This was nothing like his usual lectures and pleadings for control. He definitely had everyone\u0027s attention. \"It\u0027s time for you to grow up and take responsibility for yourselves. Do you think you get to live like this for free? That al the blood in Seattle doesn\u0027t have a price?\" The little clusters of vampires no longer seemed threatening. Everyone was wide-eyed, some exchanging mystified glances. I saw Fred\u0027s head turn toward me in my peripheral vision, but I didn\u0027t meet his gaze. My attention was focused on two things: Riley, just in case he started to attack again, and the door. The door that was stil closed. \"Are you listening now? Real y listening?\" Riley paused, but no one nodded. The room was very stil . \"Let me explain to you the precarious situation we are al in. I\u0027l try to keep it simple for the slowest ones. Raoul, Kristie, come here.\" He motioned to the leaders of the two largest gangs, al ied for this brief moment against him. Neither of them moved toward him. They braced themselves, Kristie baring her teeth. I expected Riley to soften, to apologize. To placate them and then persuade them to do what he wanted. But this was a different Riley. \"Fine,\" he snapped. \"We\u0027re going to need leaders if we\u0027re going to survive, but apparently neither of you is up to the task. I thought you had aptitude. I was wrong. Kevin, Jen, please join me as the heads of this team.\" Kevin looked up in surprise. He had just finished putting his arm back together. Though his expression was wary, it was also unmistakably flattered. He slowly got to his feet. Jen looked at Kristie as if waiting for permission. Raoul ground his teeth together. The door at the top of the stairs did not open. \"Are you not able, either?\" Riley asked, irritated. Kevin took a step toward Riley, but then Raoul rushed him, leaping across the long room in two low bounds. He shoved Kevin against the wal without a word and then stood by Riley\u0027s right shoulder. Riley permitted himself a tiny smile. The manipulation wasn\u0027t subtle, but it was effective. \"Kristie or Jen, who wil lead us?\" Riley asked with a hint of amusement in his voice. Jen was stil waiting for a sign from Kristie as to what she should do. Kristie glowered at Jen for an instant, then flipped her sandy hair out of her face and darted to stand on Riley\u0027s other side. \"That took too long to decide,\" Riley said seriously. \"We don\u0027t have the luxury of time. We don\u0027t get to fool around anymore. I\u0027ve let you al do pretty much whatever you feel like, but that ends tonight.\" He looked around the room, meeting everyone\u0027s eyes, making sure we were listening. I held his gaze for only a second when it was my turn, and then my eyes flipped back to the door. I corrected instantly, but his glare had moved on. I wondered if he\u0027d noticed my slip. Or had he seen me at al, here beside Fred? \"We have an enemy,\" Riley announced. He let that sink in for a moment. I could tel the idea was shocking to several of the vampires in the basement. The enemy was Raoul - or if you were with Raoul, the enemy was Kristie. The enemy was here, because the whole world was here. The thought that there were other forces out there strong enough to affect us was new for most. Would have been new to me, too, yesterday. \"A few of you might be smart enough to have realized that if we exist, so do other vampires. Other vampires who are older, smarter... more talented. Other vampires who want our blood!\" Raoul hissed, and then several of his fol owers echoed him in support. \"That\u0027s right,\" Riley said, seeming intent on egging them on. \"Seattle was once theirs, but they moved on a long time ago. Now they know about us, and they are jealous of the easy blood they used to have here. They know it belongs to us now, but they want to take it back. They are coming after what they want. One by one, they\u0027l hunt us down! We\u0027l burn while they feast!\" \"Never,\" Kristie growled. Some of hers and some of Raoul\u0027s growled, too. \"We don\u0027t have a lot of choices,\" Riley told us. \"If we wait for them to show up here, they wil have the advantage. This is their turf, after al . And they don\u0027t want to face us head-on, because we outnumber them and we are stronger than they are. They want to catch us separated; they want to take advantage of our biggest weakness. Are any of you smart enough to know what that is?\" He pointed at the ashes at his feet - now smeared into the carpet and unrecognizable as a former vampire - and waited. No one moved. Riley made a disgusted sound. \"Unity!\" he shouted. \"We don\u0027t have it! What kind of a threat can we pose when we won\u0027t stop kil ing each other?\" He kicked the dust, sending up a smal black cloud. \"Can you imagine them laughing at us? They think taking the city from us wil be easy. That we\u0027re weak with stupidity! That we\u0027l just hand them our blood.\" Half the vampires in the room snarled in protest now. \"Can you work together, or do we al die?\" \"We can take them, boss,\" Raoul growled. Riley scowled at him. \"Not if you can\u0027t control yourself! Not if you can\u0027t cooperate with every single person in this room. Anyone you take out\" - his toe nudged the ashes again - \"might be the one who could have kept you alive. Every one of your coven that you kil is like handing our enemies a gift. Here, you\u0027re saying, take me down! \" Kristie and Raoul exchanged a glance as if they were seeing each other for the first time. Others did the same. The word coven was not unfamiliar, but none of us had applied it to our group before. We were a coven. \"Let me tel you about our enemies,\" Riley said, and al eyes locked on his face. \"They are a much older coven than we are. They\u0027ve been around for hundreds of years, and they\u0027ve survived that long for a reason. They are crafty and they are skil ed and they are coming to retake Seattle with confidence - because they\u0027ve heard the only ones they\u0027l have to fight for it are a bunch of disorganized children who wil do half their work for them!\" More growls, but some were less angry than they were wary. A few of the quieter vampires, the ones Riley would have cal ed tamer, looked skittish. Riley noticed that, too. \"This is how they see us, but that\u0027s because they can\u0027t see us together. Together, we can crush them. If they could see al of us, side by side, fighting together, they would be terrified. And that\u0027s how they\u0027re going to see us. Because we\u0027re not going to wait for them to show up here and start picking us off. We\u0027re going to ambush them. In four days.\" Four days? I guessed our creator didn\u0027t want to cut it too close to the deadline. I looked at the closed door again. Where was Diego? Others reacted to the deadline with surprise, some with fear. \"It\u0027s the last thing they\u0027l expect,\" Riley assured us. \"Al of us - together - waiting for them. And I\u0027ve saved the best part for last. There are only seven of them.\" There was an instant of incredulous silence. Then Raoul said, \"What?\" Kristie stared at Riley with the same disbelieving expression, and I heard muttered whispers around the room. \"Seven?\" \"Are you kidding me?\" \"Hey,\" Riley snapped. \"I wasn\u0027t joking when I said this coven is dangerous. They are wise and... devious. Underhanded. We wil have power on our side; they wil have deception. If we play it their way, they will win. But if we take it to them on our terms...\" Riley didn\u0027t finish, he just smiled. \"Let\u0027s go now,\" Raoul urged. \"Let\u0027s get \u0027em out of the picture fast.\" Kevin growled enthusiastical y. \"Slow down, moron. Rushing into things blind isn\u0027t going to help us win,\" Riley chided him. \"Tel us everything we need to know about them,\" Kristie encouraged, shooting Raoul a superior look. Riley hesitated, as if deciding how to word something. \"Al right, where to begin? I guess the first thing you need to know is... that you don\u0027t know everything there is to know about vampires yet. I didn\u0027t want to overwhelm you in the beginning.\" Another pause while everyone looked confused. \"You have a little bit of experience with what we cal ��talents.\u0027 We have Fred.\" Everyone looked at Fred - or rather they tried to. I could tel from Riley\u0027s expression that Fred did not like being singled out. It looked like Fred had real y turned up the volume on his \"talent,\" as Riley cal ed it. Riley cringed and looked away quickly. I stil didn\u0027t feel anything. \"Yes, wel, there are some vampires who have gifts beyond the usual super strength and super senses. You\u0027ve seen one aspect in... our coven.\" He was careful not to say Fred\u0027s name again. \"Gifts are rare - one in fifty, maybe - but every one is different. There\u0027s a huge range of gifts out there, and some of them are more powerful than others.\" I could hear a lot of murmurs now as people wondered if they might be talented. Raoul was preening like he\u0027d already decided he was gifted. As far as I could tel, the only one around here that was in any way special was standing next to me. \"Pay attention!\" Riley commanded. \"I\u0027m not tel ing you this for entertainment.\" \"This enemy coven,\" Kristie interjected. \"They\u0027re talented. Right?\" Riley gave her an approving nod. \"Exactly. I\u0027m glad someone here can connect the dots.\" Raoul\u0027s upper lip twitched back over his teeth. \"This coven is dangerously talented,\" Riley went on, his voice dropping to a hushed whisper. \"They have a mind reader.\" He examined our faces, looking to see if we got the importance of this revelation. He didn\u0027t seem satisfied with his assessment. \"Think, guys! He\u0027l know everything in your head. If you attack, he\u0027l know what move you\u0027re going to make before you know it. You go left, he\u0027l be waiting.\" There was a nervous stil ness as everyone imagined this. \"This is why we\u0027ve been so careful - me, and the one who created you.\" Kristie flinched away from Riley when he mentioned her. Raoul looked angrier. Nerves strained universal y. \"You don\u0027t know her name, and you don\u0027t know what she looks like. This protects us al . If they\u0027d stumbled across one of you alone, they wouldn\u0027t realize that you were connected to her, and they might have let you be. If they knew you were part of her coven, there would be no delay in your execution.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-short-second-life-of-bree-tanner-twilight-4/page-11.html","bookId":2028,"book":{"id":2028,"title":"The Short Second Life of Bree Tanner (Twilight #4)","description":"Storyline: The Short Second Life of Bree Tanner is a companion novella to the Twilight series by author Stephenie Meyer.
