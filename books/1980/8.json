He couldn’t keep from looking out, although it was difficult to see anything more than the faintest silhouette of the plane.\\n\\n His next challenge was to get a fire going. Luckily everything he needed—logs, kindling and matches—had been left within easy access for just such an emergency. Once he had the wood burning, Scott checked the cupboards. Again, his family had provided an adequate supply of canned goods. He and Chrissie shouldn’t be trapped here long, four or five hours at most. The worst of the storm would pass by then, and they’d be able to land safely in Hard Luck early tomorrow morning.\\n\\n He had the coffeepot brewing on the old stove when he thought he heard a noise outside. It was probably just the wind, but in case it was Chrissie, he wanted to appear as relaxed as possible. If she happened to peek inside, he wanted her to think he didn’t have a care in the world. Throwing himself down on the big chair, he leaned back his head and closed his eyes.\\n\\n Ten minutes later his patience was gone, vanished along with the pretense. Chrissie was an idiot if she thought he was going to leave her to wait out the storm in the plane while he sat, warm and cozy, inside the cabin. He grabbed his coat, determined to trudge back to the lake.\\n\\n The wind was now mixed with ice and snow, and it stung his face when he opened the door. He shone the beam of light on the narrow footpath leading to the water’s edge. Shoulders hunched against the wind and rain, he kept his gaze down. The flashlight guided his steps, illuminating the walkway a few feet at a time. Scott paused when the light fell on a pair of wet boots. Chrissie.\\n\\n “I…I changed my mind,” she announced.\\n\\n Scott bit off any chastisement, although he had plenty he wanted to say. Instead, he held out his hand. “I’ll help you.”\\n\\n She hesitated before slipping her gloved hand in his. “Thank you.”\\n\\n She moved close to his side, and his arm went about her waist as he helped her to the cabin. With the wind at their backs, propelling them forward, they were at the door within minutes.\\n\\n The cabin was warm, comfortable and surprisingly intimate, despite its size. At first Chrissie stayed near the door, as if she feared what might happen if she advanced completely into the large open room.\\n\\n “How about a cup of coffee?” Scott asked, his back to her.\\n\\n “Please.”\\n\\n He dared not turn around for fear she’d see the amusement in his eyes. Judging by the way she maintained her distance, she apparently expected him to ravish her at any minute.\\n\\n “You were able to let someone know where we are?” she asked, rubbing her hands together as she stood in front of the fire, which was now burning well. The wood crackled and flames leaped merrily, casting warmth throughout the room.\\n\\n “Duke took the message.” Her lack of trust distressed him, and the situation no longer seemed amusing.\\n\\n “Good,” she said briskly.\\n\\n He poured them each a steaming cup of fresh coffee. He found sugar but no cream; there was, however, a bottle of whiskey, and he doctored his coffee with that. Might as well get comfort where he could. She declined.\\n\\n Making himself comfortable, Scott sat in the big overstuffed chair Sawyer favored. If Chrissie wanted to act like a piece of cardboard, that was fine by him, but he intended to relax. Despite the impression he’d given, landing the plane during the storm had been a stressful experience. “I haven’t been here in years,” he said, glancing around, seeing the cabin with new eyes.\\n\\n “Me…too.”\\n\\n “The last time—” He stopped abruptly the second he realized exactly when that last time was. Five years ago. He’d been with his sister and Chrissie; it was the summer they graduated from college.\\n\\n “The last time you were here was with me, wasn’t it?” Chrissie asked. She sat on the sofa across from him, huddled over her cup as though it was something that required her protection. Her boots and socks were off and drying by the fireplace. She sat with her bare feet tucked beneath her.\\n\\n “Seems like a lifetime ago,” he said, his voice a little hoarse. He’d watched Chrissie that day and he’d remembered everything he’d spent the past few years trying to forget. Even after he’d hurt her, she’d been trusting and sweet. The teenage girl he’d left behind had matured into a woman. That afternoon had been one of the most wonderful of his life; it’d opened his eyes to what he really wanted. All this time he’d been running away—from his family, his town, the people he’d known—and until that afternoon he hadn’t realized how much he missed Chrissie, how much he needed her.\\n\\n His original plan had been to fly into Hard Luck, attend the graduation party, then head out immediately afterward. His relationship with his mother and Sawyer was strained, and he hadn’t wanted to over-stay his welcome. During his years away, he’d made a new life for himself, first in the military and after that, in Utah. He’d hurt his parents, embarrassed them. It seemed better for everyone involved if he kept out of their lives.\\n\\n To his surprise, Sawyer and his mother had been genuinely delighted to see him, and willing to put the past behind them. He’d loved spending time with Susan, Anna and Ryan, and he’d remained in Hard Luck for ten days. His reluctance to leave, however, was due to more than his family. Scott had lingered in town because of Chrissie.\\n\\n With Sawyer’s permission, he’d borrowed the Cessna, had Ben pack him a lunch and then taken off with his high-school sweetheart for an afternoon of swimming and fun. As soon as he could manage it, Scott had Chrissie back in his arms again.\\n\\n The minute they’d kissed, those five years had dissolved and it was as if he’d never left. Every time they kissed, he had another reason to stay. Every time they touched, he felt a sense of rightness. This was home. This was Chrissie, the first girl he’d ever loved, the only girl he’d ever loved….\\n\\n “Are you tired?” he asked, wanting to cut off his memories before they took him into territory best left undisturbed.\\n\\n “Exhausted,” Chrissie admitted, sounding more relaxed now that she’d had a warm drink.\\n\\n “I’ll scrounge up some blankets from the loft.” He was anxious to do something, preferably something that required movement. Sitting around reminiscing about the one summer afternoon he most wanted to forget wouldn’t help matters. Unfortunately it was the same summer afternoon he most wanted to remember.\\n\\n He straightened the ladder that led to the loft. His parents used the upper area for storage in case bears broke into the cabin. Climbing up, he discovered that his mother had packed everything neatly away for the winter, but it didn’t take him long to find extra bedding.\\n\\n Grabbing several blankets, he carried them down for Chrissie. She’d finished her coffee and placed her mug in the sink.\\n\\n “If you want, you can sleep down here on the sofa close to the fire,” he suggested.\\n\\n She nodded.\\n\\n “I’ll take the loft.”\\n\\n She nodded again.\\n\\n “Good night, Chrissie.”\\n\\n “Night,” she muttered, her voice suspiciously low.\\n\\n Scott started up the ladder, then stopped. “Chrissie?” he asked, uncertain what had changed. Clearly something had. He heard it in her voice, although she kept her head averted and he couldn’t see her expression.\\n\\n “Yes?” She sounded cheerful again.\\n\\n He stepped off the rung and moved toward her.\\n\\n “Is everything…all right?”\\n\\n Turning to face him, still in the shadows, she said, “Listen, I know I was out of line earlier. I’m sorry for what I said.”\\n\\n “That’s okay.”\\n\\n “You can’t control the weather.” They stood no more than a few feet apart, tension electrifying the air between them. Scott didn’t know what to make of it. Part of him wanted to shout that it was time to put aside the hurts of the past and talk honestly. He opened his mouth to say as much but saw her stiffen and knew it was useless. She wouldn’t lower the emotional barricades she’d erected against him. Nor could he forget that there was another man in her life now. A man she visited in Fairbanks at least twice a month.\\n\\n “Good night,” he said again, unnecessarily. After he’d stacked extra wood by the fireplace, he climbed the ladder to the loft.\\n\\n He made up his bed, and when he lay down, he could see Chrissie below. She’d piled blankets on the sofa, then turned off the lantern. The only light in the cabin came from the flames dancing in the fireplace, throwing shadows about the room. The wind moaned outside the door. Another time the low whistle might have lulled him to sleep, but not tonight. Not with Chrissie only a few feet below, snuggling on the sofa, warm and sweet.\\n\\n Closing his eyes, he was beseiged by the memory of her kisses—the taste of her mouth against his, her eager response to him, the need she created in him with a single touch.\\n\\n “Scott?”\\n\\n Her soft voice startled him and he opened his eyes. “Yeah?”\\n\\n “Are you asleep yet?”\\n\\n “No.”\\n\\n “Do you mind if I ask you something?”\\n\\n Anything would be better than this stilted politeness. “Sure, ask away.”\\n\\n “Do you remember that last summer we were here?”\\n\\n He almost groaned aloud. “I’m not likely to forget.”\\n\\n “I wondered…” Her voice broke.\\n\\n “What did you wonder, Chrissie?” he encouraged.\\n\\n “I need to know if what Farrah said was true. Back then. Were you engaged to marry her?” She paused, then added, “Was it true?”\\n\\n He’d been lying on his stomach, his head resting on his folded arms. He rolled onto his back and stared blankly at the ceiling. He opened his mouth to tell her, to explain it all away—but he couldn’t. Yes, he had excuses and justifications for that day they’d spent on the lake, when he had, in fact, been engaged to another woman. He could tell Chrissie how he’d finally understood that Hard Luck was his home, that she held his heart. He’d wanted to tell her, but his hands had been tied. It would have been grossly unfair to Farrah, and he owed her that one kindness before he broke off the engagement.\\n\\n “Your silence is answer enough.”\\n\\n “I don’t have any excuses, but—”\\n\\n “There’s always a but, isn’t there?” Her voice had an edge that he’d never heard before.\\n\\n “Chrissie—”\\n\\n “No, listen, it’s all right, really. I shouldn’t have asked. I knew, but I needed to hear you say it.”\\n\\n At that moment he would have given anything for the ability to lie to her. Still, he couldn’t make himself do it. “I didn’t marry her.”\\n\\n “I noticed,” she said sarcastically. “She dumped you, huh? I don’t blame her. No woman in her right mind would marry a man who—” She choked off the rest, took a moment to compose herself, then continued. “A man doesn’t give a woman an engagement ring and then get involved with a high-school flame. You deserved what you got.”\\n\\n Scott could hardly keep himself from saying that not marrying Farrah was his decision—and the smartest move he’d ever made. He thanked God that he’d come to his senses in time to save them both untold heartache. They’d fallen conveniently in love, and getting married had seemed the inevitable next step. Farrah was a looker, and they got along fairly well. Not until he’d seen Chrissie again did he realize his mistake. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/born-in-a-small-town-patton-s-daughters-4/page-8.html","bookId":1980,"book":{"id":1980,"title":"Born in a Small Town (Patton\u0027s Daughters #4)","description":"Storyline: Born in a Small Town (Patton\u0027s Daughters, #4) \\n In this three-in-one story collection, fans of Macomber\u0027s \"Midnight Sons\" series meet a whole new generation of family members and get updates on original characters in \"Midnight Sons and Daughters\".
