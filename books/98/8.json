{"id":2467,"no":8,"title":"Chapter 8","content":"8:1 [hgb] 如 今 那 些 在 基 督 耶 稣 里 的 ， 就 不 定 罪 了 。 [kjv] There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. [bbe] For this cause those who are in Christ Jesus will not be judged as sinners. 8:2 [hgb] 因 为 赐 生 命 圣 灵 的 律 ， 在 基 督 耶 稣 里 释 放 了 我 ， 使 我 脱 离 罪 和 死 的 律 了 。 [kjv] For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death. [bbe] For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death. 8:3 [hgb] 律 法 既 因 肉 体 软 弱 ， 有 所 不 能 行 的 ， 神 就 差 遣 自 己 的 儿 子 ， 成 为 罪 身 的 形 状 ， 作 了 赎 罪 祭 ， 在 肉 体 中 定 了 罪 案 ， [kjv] For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: [bbe] For what the law was not able to do because it was feeble through the flesh, God, sending his Son in the image of the evil flesh, and as an offering for sin, gave his decision against sin in the flesh: 8:4 [hgb] 使 律 法 的 义 成 就 在 我 们 这 不 随 从 肉 体 ， 只 随 从 圣 灵 的 人 身 上 。 [kjv] That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. [bbe] So that what was ordered by the law might be done in us, who are living, not in the way of the flesh, but in the way of the Spirit. 8:5 [hgb] 因 为 随 从 肉 体 的 人 体 贴 肉 体 的 事 ， 随 从 圣 灵 的 人 体 贴 圣 灵 的 事 。 [kjv] For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit. [bbe] For those who are living in the way of the flesh give their minds to the things of the flesh, but those who go in the way of the Spirit, to the things of the Spirit. 8:6 [hgb] 体 贴 肉 体 的 ， 就 是 死 ， 体 贴 圣 灵 的 ， 乃 是 生 命 ， 平 安 。 [kjv] For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace. [bbe] For the mind of the flesh is death, but the mind of the Spirit is life and peace: 8:7 [hgb] 原 来 体 贴 肉 体 的 ， 就 是 与 神 为 仇 。 因 为 不 服 神 的 律 法 ， 也 是 不 能 服 。 [kjv] Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. [bbe] Because the mind of the flesh is opposite to God; it is not under the law of God, and is not able to be: 8:8 [hgb] 而 且 属 肉 体 的 人 ， 不 能 得 神 的 喜 欢 。 [kjv] So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God. [bbe] So that those who are in the flesh are not able to give pleasure to God. 8:9 [hgb] 如 果 神 的 灵 住 在 你 们 心 里 ， 你 们 就 不 属 肉 体 ， 乃 属 圣 灵 了 。 人 若 没 有 基 督 的 灵 ， 就 不 是 属 基 督 的 。 [kjv] But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his. [bbe] You are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if the Spirit of God is in you. But if any man has not the Spirit of Christ he is not one of his. 8:10 [hgb] 基 督 若 在 你 们 心 里 ， 身 体 就 因 罪 而 死 ， 心 灵 却 因 义 而 活 。 [kjv] And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness. [bbe] And if Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the Spirit is life because of righteousness. 8:11 [hgb] 然 而 叫 耶 稣 从 死 里 复 活 者 的 灵 ， 若 住 在 你 们 心 里 ， 那 叫 基 督 耶 稣 从 死 里 复 活 的 ， 也 必 借 着 住 在 你 们 心 里 的 圣 灵 ， 使 你 们 必 死 的 身 体 又 活 过 来 。 [kjv] But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you. [bbe] But if the Spirit of him who made Jesus come again from the dead is in you, he who made Christ Jesus come again from the dead will in the same way, through his Spirit which is in you, give life to your bodies which now are under the power of death. 8:12 [hgb] 弟 兄 们 ， 这 样 看 来 ， 我 们 并 不 是 欠 肉 体 的 债 ， 去 顺 从 肉 体 活 着 。 [kjv] Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh. [bbe] So then, my brothers, we are in debt, not to the flesh to be living in the way of the flesh: 8:13 [hgb] 你 们 若 顺 从 肉 体 活 着 必 要 死 。 若 靠 着 圣 灵 治 死 身 体 的 恶 行 必 要 活 着 。 [kjv] For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live. [bbe] For if you go in the way of the flesh, death will come on you; but if by the Spirit you put to death the works of the body, you will have life. 8:14 [hgb] 因 为 凡 被 神 的 灵 引 导 的 ， 都 是 神 的 儿 子 。 [kjv] For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God. [bbe] And all those who are guided by the Spirit of God are sons of God. 8:15 [hgb] 你 们 所 受 的 不 是 奴 仆 的 心 ， 仍 旧 害 怕 。 所 受 的 乃 是 儿 子 的 心 ， 因 此 我 们 呼 叫 阿 爸 ， 父 。 [kjv] For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. [bbe] For you did not get the spirit of servants again to put you in fear, but the spirit of sons was given to you, by which we say, Abba, Father. 8:16 [hgb] 圣 灵 与 我 们 的 心 同 证 我 们 是 神 的 儿 女 。 [kjv] The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God: [bbe] The Spirit is witness with our spirit that we are children of God: 8:17 [hgb] 既 是 儿 女 ， 便 是 后 嗣 ， 就 是 神 的 后 嗣 ， 和 基 督 同 作 后 嗣 。 如 果 我 们 和 他 一 同 受 苦 ， 也 必 和 他 一 同 得 荣 耀 。 [kjv] And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together. [bbe] And if we are children, we have a right to a part in the heritage; a part in the things of God, together with Christ; so that if we have a part in his pain, we will in the same way have a part in his glory. 8:18 [hgb] 我 想 现 在 的 苦 楚 ， 若 比 起 将 来 要 显 于 我 们 的 荣 耀 ， 就 不 足 介 意 了 。 [kjv] For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. [bbe] I am of the opinion that there is no comparison between the pain of this present time and the glory which we will see in the future. 8:19 [hgb] 受 造 之 物 ， 切 望 等 候 神 的 众 子 显 出 来 。 [kjv] For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God. [bbe] For the strong desire of every living thing is waiting for the revelation of the sons of God. 8:20 [hgb] 因 为 受 造 之 物 服 在 虚 空 之 下 ， 不 是 自 己 愿 意 ， 乃 是 因 那 叫 他 如 此 的 。 [kjv] For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope, [bbe] For every living thing was put under the power of change, not by its desire, but by him who made it so, in hope 8:21 [hgb] 但 受 造 之 物 仍 然 指 望 脱 离 败 坏 的 辖 制 ， 得 享 神 儿 女 自 由 的 荣 耀 。 （ 享 原 文 作 入 ） [kjv] Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God. [bbe] That all living things will be made free from the power of death and will have a part with the free children of God in glory. 8:22 [hgb] 我 们 知 道 一 切 受 造 之 物 ， 一 同 叹 息 劳 苦 ， 直 到 如 今 。 [kjv] For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now. [bbe] For we are conscious that all living things are weeping and sorrowing in pain together till now. 8:23 [hgb] 不 但 如 此 ， 就 是 我 们 这 有 圣 灵 初 结 果 子 的 ， 也 是 自 己 心 里 叹 息 ， 等 候 得 着 儿 子 的 名 分 ， 乃 是 我 们 的 身 体 得 赎 。 [kjv] And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body. [bbe] And not only so, but we who have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we have sorrow in our minds, waiting for the time when we will take our place as sons, that is, the salvation of our bodies. 8:24 [hgb] 我 们 得 救 是 在 乎 盼 望 。 只 是 所 见 的 盼 望 不 是 盼 望 。 谁 还 盼 望 他 所 见 的 呢 ？ （ 有 古 卷 作 人 所 看 见 的 何 必 再 盼 望 呢 ） [kjv] For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? [bbe] For our salvation is by hope: but hope which is seen is not hope: for who is hoping for what he sees? 8:25 [hgb] 但 我 们 若 盼 望 那 所 不 见 的 ， 就 必 忍 耐 等 候 。 [kjv] But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it. [bbe] But if we have hope for that which we see not, then we will be able to go on waiting for it. 8:26 [hgb] 况 且 我 们 的 软 弱 有 圣 灵 帮 助 ， 我 们 本 不 晓 得 当 怎 样 祷 告 ， 只 是 圣 灵 亲 自 用 说 不 出 来 的 叹 息 ， 替 我 们 祷 告 。 [kjv] Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. [bbe] And in the same way the Spirit is a help to our feeble hearts: for we are not able to make prayer to God in the right way; but the Spirit puts our desires into words which are not in our power to say; 8:27 [hgb] 鉴 察 人 心 的 ， 晓 得 圣 灵 的 意 思 因 为 圣 灵 照 着 神 的 旨 意 替 圣 徒 祈 求 。 [kjv] And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God. [bbe] And he who is the searcher of hearts has knowledge of the mind of the Spirit, because he is making prayers for the saints in agreement with the mind of God. 8:28 [hgb] 我 们 晓 得 万 事 都 互 相 效 力 ， 叫 爱 神 的 人 得 益 处 ， 就 是 按 他 旨 意 被 召 的 人 。 [kjv] And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose. [bbe] And we are conscious that all things are working together for good to those who have love for God, and have been marked out by his purpose. 8:29 [hgb] 因 为 他 预 先 所 知 道 的 人 ， 就 预 先 定 下 效 法 他 儿 子 的 模 样 ， 使 他 儿 子 在 许 多 弟 兄 中 作 长 子 。 [kjv] For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. [bbe] Because those of whom he had knowledge before they came into existence, were marked out by him to be made like his Son, so that he might be the first among a band of brothers: 8:30 [hgb] 预 先 所 定 下 的 人 又 召 他 们 来 。 所 召 来 的 人 ， 又 称 他 们 为 义 。 所 称 为 义 的 人 ， 又 叫 他 们 得 荣 耀 。 [kjv] Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified. [bbe] And those who were marked out by him were named; and those who were named were given righteousness; and to those to whom he gave righteousness, in the same way he gave glory. 8:31 [hgb] 既 是 这 样 ， 还 有 什 么 说 的 呢 ？ 神 若 帮 助 我 们 ， 谁 能 敌 挡 我 们 呢 ？ [kjv] What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us? [bbe] What may we say about these things? If God is for us, who is against us? 8:32 [hgb] 神 既 不 爱 惜 自 己 的 儿 子 为 我 们 众 人 舍 了 ， 岂 不 也 把 万 物 和 他 一 同 白 白 地 赐 给 我 们 吗 ？ [kjv] He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things? [bbe] He who did not keep back his only Son, but gave him up for us all, will he not with him freely give us all things? 8:33 [hgb] 谁 能 控 告 神 所 拣 选 的 人 呢 ？ 有 神 称 他 们 为 义 了 。 （ 或 作 是 称 他 们 为 义 的 神 吗 ？ ） [kjv] Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God\u0027s elect? It is God that justifieth. [bbe] Who will say anything against the saints of God? It is God who makes us clear from evil; 8:34 [hgb] 谁 能 定 他 们 的 罪 呢 ？ 有 基 督 耶 稣 已 经 死 了 ， 而 且 从 死 里 复 活 ， 现 今 在 神 的 右 边 ， 也 替 我 们 祈 求 。 （ 有 基 督 云 云 或 作 是 已 经 死 了 而 且 从 死 里 复 活 现 今 在 神 的 右 边 也 替 我 们 祈 求 的 基 督 耶 稣 吗 ） [kjv] Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us. [bbe] Who will give a decision against us? It is Christ Jesus who not only was put to death, but came again from the dead, who is now at the right hand of God, taking our part. 8:35 [hgb] 谁 能 使 我 们 与 基 督 的 爱 隔 绝 呢 ？ 难 道 是 患 难 吗 ？ 是 困 苦 吗 ？ 是 逼 迫 吗 ？ 是 饥 饿 吗 ？ 是 赤 身 露 体 吗 ？ 是 危 险 吗 ？ 是 刀 剑 吗 ？ [kjv] Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? [bbe] Who will come between us and the love of Christ? Will trouble, or pain, or cruel acts, or the need of food or of clothing, or danger, or the sword? 8:36 [hgb] 如 经 上 所 记 ， 我 们 为 你 的 缘 故 ， 终 日 被 杀 。 人 看 我 们 如 将 宰 的 羊 [kjv] As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. [bbe] As it is said in the holy Writings, Because of you we are put to death every day; we are like sheep ready for destruction. 8:37 [hgb] 然 而 靠 着 爱 我 们 的 主 ， 在 这 一 切 的 事 上 ， 已 经 得 胜 有 余 了 。 [kjv] Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. [bbe] But we are able to overcome all these things and more through his love. 8:38 [hgb] 因 为 我 深 信 无 论 是 死 ， 是 生 ， 是 天 使 ， 是 掌 权 的 ， 是 有 能 的 ， 是 现 在 的 事 ， 是 将 来 的 事 ， [kjv] For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, [bbe] For I am certain that not death, or life, or angels, or rulers, or things present, or things to come, or powers, 8:39 [hgb] 是 高 处 的 ， 是 低 处 的 ， 是 别 的 受 造 之 物 ， 都 不 能 叫 我 们 与 神 的 爱 隔 绝 。 这 爱 是 在 我 们 的 主 基 督 耶 稣 里 的 。 [kjv] Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. [bbe] Or things on high, or things under the earth, or anything which is made, will be able to come between us and the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/162/2230.html","bookId":98,"book":{"id":98,"title":"罗马书 Romans","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 耶 稣 基 督 的 仆 人 保 罗 ， 奉 召 为 使 徒 ， 特 派 传 神 的 福 音 。 [kjv] Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God, \u0026nbs...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/162","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:30 AM"}}
