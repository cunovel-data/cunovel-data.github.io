{"id":2465,"no":6,"title":"Chapter 6","content":"6:1 [hgb] 这 样 ， 怎 么 说 呢 ？ 我 们 可 以 仍 在 罪 中 ， 叫 恩 典 显 多 吗 ？ \n [kjv] What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? \n [bbe] What may we say, then? are we to go on in sin so that there may be more grace? \n 6:2 [hgb] 断 乎 不 可 。 我 们 在 罪 上 死 了 的 人 ， 岂 可 仍 在 罪 中 活 着 呢 ？ \n [kjv] God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein? \n [bbe] In no way. How may we, who are dead to sin, be living in it any longer? \n 6:3 [hgb] 岂 不 知 我 们 这 受 洗 归 入 基 督 耶 稣 的 人 ， 是 受 洗 归 入 他 的 死 吗 ？ \n [kjv] Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? \n [bbe] Or are you without the knowledge that all we who had baptism into Christ Jesus, had baptism into his death? \n 6:4 [hgb] 所 以 ， 我 们 借 着 洗 礼 归 入 死 ， 和 他 一 同 埋 葬 ， 原 是 叫 我 们 一 举 一 动 有 新 生 的 样 式 ， 像 基 督 借 着 父 的 荣 耀 从 死 里 复 活 一 样 。 \n [kjv] Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. \n [bbe] We have been placed with him among the dead through baptism into death: so that as Christ came again from the dead by the glory of the Father, we, in the same way, might be living in new life. \n 6:5 [hgb] 我 们 若 在 他 死 的 形 状 上 与 他 联 合 ， 也 要 在 他 复 活 的 形 状 上 与 他 联 合 。 \n [kjv] For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection: \n [bbe] For, if we have been made like him in his death, we will, in the same way, be like him in his coming to life again; \n 6:6 [hgb] 因 为 知 道 我 们 的 旧 人 和 他 同 钉 十 字 架 ， 使 罪 身 灭 绝 ， 叫 我 们 不 再 作 罪 的 奴 仆 。 \n [kjv] Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin. \n [bbe] Being conscious that our old man was put to death on the cross with him, so that the body of sin might be put away, and we might no longer be servants to sin. \n 6:7 [hgb] 因 为 已 死 的 人 ， 是 脱 离 了 罪 。 \n [kjv] For he that is dead is freed from sin. \n [bbe] Because he who is dead is free from sin. \n 6:8 [hgb] 我 们 若 是 与 基 督 同 死 ， 就 信 必 与 他 同 活 。 \n [kjv] Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him: \n [bbe] But if we are dead with Christ, we have faith that we will be living with him; \n 6:9 [hgb] 因 为 知 道 基 督 既 从 死 里 复 活 ， 就 不 再 死 ， 死 也 不 再 作 他 的 主 了 。 \n [kjv] Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him. \n [bbe] Having knowledge that because Christ has come back from the dead, he will never again go down to the dead; death has no more power over him. \n 6:10 [hgb] 他 死 是 向 罪 死 了 ， 只 有 一 次 。 他 活 是 向 神 活 着 。 \n [kjv] For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God. \n [bbe] For his death was a death to sin, but his life now is a life which he is living to God. \n 6:11 [hgb] 这 样 ， 你 们 向 罪 也 当 看 自 己 是 死 的 。 向 神 在 基 督 耶 稣 里 却 当 看 自 己 是 活 的 。 \n [kjv] Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord. \n [bbe] Even so see yourselves as dead to sin, but living to God in Christ Jesus. \n 6:12 [hgb] 所 以 不 要 容 罪 在 你 们 必 死 的 身 上 作 王 ， 使 你 们 顺 从 身 子 的 私 欲 。 \n [kjv] Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof. \n [bbe] For this cause do not let sin be ruling in your body which is under the power of death, so that you give way to its desires; \n 6:13 [hgb] 也 不 要 将 你 们 的 肢 体 献 给 罪 作 不 义 的 器 具 。 倒 要 像 从 死 里 复 活 的 人 ， 将 自 己 献 给 神 。 并 将 肢 体 作 义 的 器 具 献 给 神 。 \n [kjv] Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God. \n [bbe] And do not give your bodies to sin as the instruments of wrongdoing, but give yourselves to God, as those who are living from the dead, and your bodies as instruments of righteousness to God. \n 6:14 [hgb] 罪 必 不 能 作 你 们 的 主 。 因 你 们 不 在 律 法 之 下 ， 乃 在 恩 典 之 下 。 \n [kjv] For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace. \n [bbe] For sin may not have rule over you: because you are not under law, but under grace. \n 6:15 [hgb] 这 却 怎 么 样 呢 ？ 我 们 在 恩 典 之 下 ， 不 在 律 法 之 下 ， 就 可 以 犯 罪 吗 ？ 断 乎 不 可 。 \n [kjv] What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid. \n [bbe] What then? are we to go on in sin because we are not under law but under grace? Let it not be so. \n 6:16 [hgb] 岂 不 晓 得 你 们 献 上 自 己 作 奴 仆 ， 顺 从 谁 ， 就 作 谁 的 奴 仆 吗 ？ 或 作 罪 的 奴 仆 ， 以 至 于 死 。 或 作 顺 命 的 奴 仆 ， 以 至 成 义 。 \n [kjv] Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness? \n [bbe] Are you not conscious that you are the servants of him to whom you give yourselves to do his desire? if to sin, the end being death, or if to do the desire of God, the end being righteousness. \n 6:17 [hgb] 感 谢 神 ， 因 为 你 们 从 前 虽 然 作 罪 的 奴 仆 ， 现 今 却 从 心 里 顺 服 了 所 传 给 你 们 道 理 的 模 范 。 \n [kjv] But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you. \n [bbe] But praise be to God that though you were the servants of sin, you have now given yourselves freely to that form of teaching under which you were placed; \n 6:18 [hgb] 你 们 既 从 罪 里 得 了 释 放 ， 就 作 了 义 的 奴 仆 。 \n [kjv] Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness. \n [bbe] And being made free from sin you have been made the servants of righteousness. \n 6:19 [hgb] 我 因 你 们 肉 体 的 软 弱 ， 就 照 人 的 常 话 对 你 们 说 ， 你 们 从 前 怎 样 将 肢 体 献 给 不 洁 不 法 作 奴 仆 ， 以 至 于 不 法 。 现 今 也 要 照 样 将 肢 体 献 给 义 作 奴 仆 ， 以 至 于 成 圣 。 \n [kjv] I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness. \n [bbe] I am using words in the way of men, because your flesh is feeble: as you gave your bodies as servants to what is unclean, and to evil to do evil, so now give them as servants to righteousness to do what is holy. \n 6:20 [hgb] 因 为 你 们 作 罪 之 奴 仆 的 时 候 ， 就 不 被 义 约 束 了 。 \n [kjv] For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness. \n [bbe] When you were servants of sin you were free from righteousness. \n 6:21 [hgb] 你 们 现 今 所 看 为 羞 耻 的 事 ， 当 日 有 什 么 果 子 呢 ？ 那 些 事 的 结 局 就 是 死 。 \n [kjv] What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death. \n [bbe] What fruit had you at that time in the things which are now a shame to you? for the end of such things is death. \n 6:22 [hgb] 但 现 今 你 们 既 从 罪 里 得 了 释 放 ， 作 了 神 的 奴 仆 ， 就 有 成 圣 的 果 子 ， 那 结 局 就 是 永 生 。 \n [kjv] But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life. \n [bbe] But now, being free from sin, and having been made servants to God, you have your fruit in that which is holy, and the end is eternal life. \n 6:23 [hgb] 因 为 罪 的 工 价 乃 是 死 。 惟 有 神 的 恩 赐 ， 在 我 们 的 主 基 督 耶 稣 里 乃 是 永 生 。 \n [kjv] For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. \n [bbe] For the reward of sin is death; but what God freely gives is eternal life in Jesus Christ our Lord. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/162/2228.html","bookId":98,"book":{"id":98,"title":"罗马书 Romans","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 耶 稣 基 督 的 仆 人 保 罗 ， 奉 召 为 使 徒 ， 特 派 传 神 的 福 音 。 [kjv] Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God, \u0026nbs...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/162","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:30 AM"}}
