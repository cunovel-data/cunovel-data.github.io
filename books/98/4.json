{"id":2463,"no":4,"title":"Chapter 4","content":"4:1 [hgb] 如 此 说 来 ， 我 们 的 祖 宗 亚 伯 拉 罕 ， 凭 着 肉 体 得 了 什 么 呢 ？ [kjv] What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found? [bbe] What, then, may we say that Abraham, our father after the flesh, has got? 4:2 [hgb] 倘 若 亚 伯 拉 罕 是 因 行 为 称 义 ， 就 有 可 夸 的 。 只 是 在 神 面 前 并 无 可 夸 。 [kjv] For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not before God. [bbe] For if Abraham got righteousness by works, he has reason for pride; but not before God. 4:3 [hgb] 经 上 说 什 么 呢 ？ 说 ， 亚 伯 拉 罕 信 神 ， 这 就 算 为 他 的 义 。 [kjv] For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness. [bbe] But what does it say in the holy Writings? And Abraham had faith in God, and it was put to his account as righteousness. 4:4 [hgb] 作 工 的 得 工 价 ， 不 算 恩 典 ， 乃 是 该 得 的 ， [kjv] Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt. [bbe] Now, the reward is credited to him who does works, not as of grace but as a debt. 4:5 [hgb] 惟 有 不 作 工 的 ， 只 信 称 罪 人 为 义 的 神 ， 他 的 信 就 算 为 义 。 [kjv] But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness. [bbe] But to him who without working has faith in him who gives righteousness to the evil-doer, his faith is put to his account as righteousness. 4:6 [hgb] 正 如 大 卫 称 那 在 行 为 以 外 ， 蒙 神 算 为 义 的 人 是 有 福 的 。 [kjv] Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works, [bbe] As David says that there is a blessing on the man to whose account God puts righteousness without works, saying, 4:7 [hgb] 他 说 ， 得 赦 免 其 过 ， 遮 盖 其 罪 的 ， 这 人 是 有 福 的 。 [kjv] Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered. [bbe] Happy are those who have forgiveness for their wrongdoing, and whose sins are covered. 4:8 [hgb] 主 不 算 为 有 罪 的 ， 这 人 是 有 福 的 。 [kjv] Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin. [bbe] Happy is the man against whom no sin is recorded by the Lord. 4:9 [hgb] 如 此 看 来 ， 这 福 是 单 加 给 那 受 割 礼 的 人 吗 ？ 不 也 是 加 给 那 未 受 割 礼 的 人 吗 ？ 因 我 们 所 说 ， 亚 伯 拉 罕 的 信 ， 就 算 为 他 的 义 。 [kjv] Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness. [bbe] Is this blessing, then, for the circumcision only, or in the same way for those who have not circumcision? for we say that the faith of Abraham was put to his account as righteousness. 4:10 [hgb] 是 怎 么 算 的 呢 ？ 是 在 他 受 割 礼 的 时 候 呢 ？ 是 在 他 未 受 割 礼 的 时 候 呢 ？ 不 是 在 受 割 礼 的 时 候 ， 乃 是 在 未 受 割 礼 的 时 候 。 [kjv] How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision. [bbe] How, then, was it judged? when he had circumcision, or when he had it not? Not when he had it, but when he did not have it: 4:11 [hgb] 并 且 他 受 了 割 礼 的 记 号 ， 作 他 未 受 割 礼 的 时 候 因 信 称 义 的 印 证 ， 叫 他 作 一 切 未 受 割 礼 而 信 之 人 的 父 ， 使 他 们 也 算 为 义 。 [kjv] And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also: [bbe] And he was given the sign of circumcision as a witness of the faith which he had before he underwent circumcision: so that he might be the father of all those who have faith, though they have not circumcision, and so that righteousness might be put to their account; 4:12 [hgb] 又 作 受 割 礼 之 人 的 父 ， 就 是 那 些 不 但 受 割 礼 ， 并 且 按 我 们 的 祖 宗 亚 伯 拉 罕 ， 未 受 割 礼 而 信 之 踪 迹 去 行 的 人 。 [kjv] And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised. [bbe] And the father of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision, but who keep to the way of that faith which our father Abraham had before he underwent circumcision. 4:13 [hgb] 因 为 神 应 许 亚 伯 拉 罕 和 他 后 裔 ， 必 得 承 受 世 界 ， 不 是 因 律 法 ， 乃 是 因 信 而 得 的 义 。 [kjv] For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith. [bbe] For God\u0027s word, that the earth would be his heritage, was given to Abraham, not through the law, but through the righteousness of faith. 4:14 [hgb] 若 是 属 乎 律 法 的 人 ， 才 得 为 后 嗣 ， 信 就 归 于 虚 空 ， 应 许 也 就 废 弃 了 。 [kjv] For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect: [bbe] For if they who are of the law are the people who get the heritage, then faith is made of no use, and the word of God has no power; 4:15 [hgb] 因 为 律 法 是 惹 动 忿 怒 的 。 （ 或 作 叫 人 受 刑 的 ） 哪 里 没 有 律 法 ， 哪 里 就 没 有 过 犯 。 [kjv] Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression. [bbe] For the outcome of the law is wrath; but where there is no law it will not be broken. 4:16 [hgb] 所 以 人 得 为 后 嗣 是 本 乎 信 。 因 此 就 属 乎 恩 。 叫 应 许 定 然 归 给 一 切 后 裔 。 不 但 归 给 那 属 乎 律 法 的 ， 也 归 给 那 效 法 亚 伯 拉 罕 之 信 的 。 [kjv] Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all, [bbe] For this reason it is of faith, so that it may be through grace; and so that the word of God may be certain to all the seed; not only to that which is of the law, but to that which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all, 4:17 [hgb] 亚 伯 拉 罕 所 信 的 ， 是 那 叫 死 人 复 活 使 无 变 为 有 的 神 ， 他 在 主 面 前 作 我 们 世 人 的 父 。 如 经 上 所 记 ， 我 已 经 立 你 作 多 国 的 父 。 [kjv] (As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were. [bbe] (As it is said in the holy Writings, I have made you a father of a number of nations) before him in whom he had faith, that is, God, who gives life to the dead, and to whom the things which are not are as if they were. 4:18 [hgb] 他 在 无 可 指 望 的 时 候 ， 因 信 仍 有 指 望 ， 就 得 以 作 多 国 的 父 ， 正 如 先 前 所 说 ， 你 的 后 裔 将 要 如 此 。 [kjv] Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be. [bbe] Who without reason for hope, in faith went on hoping, so that he became the father of a number of nations, as it had been said, So will your seed be. 4:19 [hgb] 他 将 近 百 岁 的 时 候 ， 虽 然 想 到 自 己 的 身 体 如 同 已 死 ， 撒 拉 的 生 育 已 经 断 绝 ， 他 的 信 心 还 是 不 软 弱 。 [kjv] And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah\u0027s womb: [bbe] And not being feeble in faith though his body seemed to him little better than dead (he being about a hundred years old) and Sarah was no longer able to have children: 4:20 [hgb] 并 且 仰 望 神 的 应 许 ， 总 没 有 因 不 信 ， 心 里 起 疑 惑 。 反 倒 因 信 ， 心 里 得 坚 固 ， 将 荣 耀 归 给 神 。 [kjv] He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God; [bbe] Still, he did not give up faith in the undertaking of God, but was made strong by faith, giving glory to God, 4:21 [hgb] 且 满 心 相 信 ， 神 所 应 许 的 必 能 作 成 。 [kjv] And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform. [bbe] And being certain that God was able to keep his word. 4:22 [hgb] 所 以 这 就 算 为 他 的 义 。 [kjv] And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness. [bbe] For which reason it was put to his account as righteousness. 4:23 [hgb] 算 为 他 义 的 这 句 话 ， 不 是 单 为 他 写 的 ， [kjv] Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him; [bbe] Now, it was not because of him only that this was said, 4:24 [hgb] 也 是 为 我 们 将 来 得 算 为 义 之 人 写 的 。 就 是 我 们 这 信 神 使 我 们 的 主 耶 稣 从 死 里 复 活 的 人 。 [kjv] But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead; [bbe] But for us in addition, to whose account it will be put, if we have faith in him who made Jesus our Lord come back again from the dead, 4:25 [hgb] 耶 稣 被 交 给 人 ， 是 为 我 们 的 过 犯 ， 复 活 是 为 叫 我 们 称 义 。 （ 或 作 耶 稣 是 为 我 们 的 过 犯 交 付 了 是 为 我 们 称 义 复 活 了 ） [kjv] Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification. [bbe] Who was put to death for our evil-doing, and came to life again so that we might have righteousness.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/162/2226.html","bookId":98,"book":{"id":98,"title":"罗马书 Romans","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 耶 稣 基 督 的 仆 人 保 罗 ， 奉 召 为 使 徒 ， 特 派 传 神 的 福 音 。 [kjv] Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God, \u0026nbs...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/162","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:30 AM"}}
