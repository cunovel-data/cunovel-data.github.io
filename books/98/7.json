Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet. \\n\\n [bbe] What then is to be said? is the law sin? in no way. But I would not have had knowledge of sin but for the law: for I would not have been conscious of desire if the law had not said, You may not have a desire for what is another\u0027s. \\n\\n 7:8 [hgb] 然 而 罪 趁 着 机 会 ， 就 借 着 诫 命 叫 诸 般 的 贪 心 在 我 里 头 发 动 。 因 为 没 有 律 法 罪 是 死 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead. \\n\\n [bbe] But sin, taking its chance through that which was ordered by the law, was working in me every form of desire: because without the law sin is dead. \\n\\n 7:9 [hgb] 我 以 前 没 有 律 法 是 活 着 的 ， 但 是 诫 命 来 到 ， 罪 又 活 了 ， 我 就 死 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died. \\n\\n [bbe] And there was a time when I was living without the law: but when the law gave its orders, sin came to life and put me to death; \\n\\n 7:10 [hgb] 那 本 来 叫 人 活 的 诫 命 ， 反 倒 叫 我 死 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death. \\n\\n [bbe] And I made the discovery that the law whose purpose was to give life had become a cause of death: \\n\\n 7:11 [hgb] 因 为 罪 趁 着 机 会 ， 就 借 着 诫 命 引 诱 我 ， 并 且 杀 了 我 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me. \\n\\n [bbe] For I was tricked and put to death by sin, which took its chance through the law. \\n\\n 7:12 [hgb] 这 样 看 来 ， 律 法 是 圣 洁 的 ， 诫 命 也 是 圣 洁 ， 公 义 ， 良 善 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good. \\n\\n [bbe] But the law is holy, and its orders are holy, upright, and good. \\n\\n 7:13 [hgb] 既 然 如 此 ， 那 良 善 的 是 叫 我 死 吗 ？ 断 乎 不 是 。 叫 我 死 的 乃 是 罪 。 但 罪 借 着 那 良 善 的 叫 我 死 ， 就 显 出 真 是 罪 。 叫 罪 因 着 诫 命 更 显 出 是 恶 极 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful. \\n\\n [bbe] Was then that which is good, death to me? In no way. But the purpose was that sin might be seen to be sin by working death to me through that which is good; so that through the orders of the law sin might seem much more evil. \\n\\n 7:14 [hgb] 我 们 原 晓 得 律 法 是 属 乎 灵 的 ， 但 我 是 属 乎 肉 体 的 ， 是 已 经 卖 给 罪 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin. \\n\\n [bbe] For we are conscious that the law is of the spirit; but I am of the flesh, given into the power of sin. \\n\\n 7:15 [hgb] 因 为 我 所 作 的 ， 我 自 己 不 明 白 。 我 所 愿 意 的 ， 我 并 不 作 。 我 所 恨 恶 的 ， 我 倒 去 作 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I. \\n\\n [bbe] And I have no clear knowledge of what I am doing, for that which I have a mind to do, I do not, but what I have hate for, that I do. \\n\\n 7:16 [hgb] 若 我 所 作 的 ， 是 我 所 不 愿 意 的 ， 我 就 应 承 律 法 是 善 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good. \\n\\n [bbe] But, if I do that which I have no mind to do, I am in agreement with the law that the law is good. \\n\\n 7:17 [hgb] 既 是 这 样 ， 就 不 是 我 作 的 ， 乃 是 住 在 我 里 头 的 罪 作 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. \\n\\n [bbe] So it is no longer I who do it, but the sin living in me. \\n\\n 7:18 [hgb] 我 也 知 道 ， 在 我 里 头 ， 就 是 我 肉 体 之 中 ， 没 有 良 善 。 因 为 立 志 为 善 由 得 我 ， 只 是 行 出 来 由 不 得 我 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not. \\n\\n [bbe] For I am conscious that in me, that is, in my flesh, there is nothing good: I have the mind but not the power to do what is right. \\n\\n 7:19 [hgb] 故 此 ， 我 所 愿 意 的 善 ， 我 反 不 作 。 我 所 不 愿 意 的 恶 ， 我 倒 去 作 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do. \\n\\n [bbe] For the good which I have a mind to do, I do not: but the evil which I have no mind to do, that I do. \\n\\n 7:20 [hgb] 若 我 去 作 所 不 愿 意 作 的 ， 就 不 是 我 作 的 ， 乃 是 住 在 我 里 头 的 罪 作 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. \\n\\n [bbe] But if I do what I have no mind to do, it is no longer I who do it, but the sin living in me. \\n\\n 7:21 [hgb] 我 觉 得 有 个 律 ， 就 是 我 愿 意 为 善 的 时 候 ， 便 有 恶 与 我 同 在 。 \\n\\n [kjv] I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me. \\n\\n [bbe] So I see a law that, though I have a mind to do good, evil is present in me. \\n\\n 7:22 [hgb] 因 为 按 着 我 里 面 的 意 思 。 （ 原 文 作 人 ） 我 是 喜 欢 神 的 律 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For I delight in the law of God after the inward man: \\n\\n [bbe] In my heart I take pleasure in the law of God, \\n\\n 7:23 [hgb] 但 我 觉 得 肢 体 中 另 有 个 律 ， 和 我 心 中 的 律 交 战 ， 把 我 掳 去 叫 我 附 从 那 肢 体 中 犯 罪 的 律 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. \\n\\n [bbe] But I see another law in my body, working against the law of my mind, and making me the servant of the law of sin which is in my flesh. \\n\\n 7:24 [hgb] 我 真 是 苦 阿 ， 谁 能 救 我 脱 离 这 取 死 的 身 体 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death? \\n\\n [bbe] How unhappy am I! who will make me free from the body of this death? \\n\\n 7:25 [hgb] 感 谢 神 ， 靠 着 我 们 的 主 耶 稣 基 督 就 能 脱 离 了 这 样 看 来 ， 我 以 内 心 顺 服 神 的 律 。 我 肉 体 却 顺 服 罪 的 律 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin. \\n\\n [bbe] I give praise to God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So with my mind I am a servant to the law of God, but with my flesh to the law of sin. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/162/2229.html","bookId":98,"book":{"id":98,"title":"罗马书 Romans","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 耶 稣 基 督 的 仆 人 保 罗 ， 奉 召 为 使 徒 ， 特 派 传 神 的 福 音 。 [kjv] Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God, \u0026nbs...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/162","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:30 AM"}}
