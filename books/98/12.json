[bbe] For this reason I make request to you, brothers, by the mercies of God, that you will give your bodies as a living offering, holy, pleasing to God, which is the worship it is right for you to give him. 12:2 [hgb] 不 要 效 法 这 个 世 界 。 只 要 心 意 更 新 而 变 化 ， 叫 你 们 察 验 何 为 神 的 善 良 ， 纯 全 可 喜 悦 的 旨 意 。 [kjv] And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God. [bbe] And let not your behaviour be like that of this world, but be changed and made new in mind, so that by experience you may have knowledge of the good and pleasing and complete purpose of God. 12:3 [hgb] 我 凭 着 所 赐 我 的 恩 ， 对 你 们 各 人 说 ， 不 要 看 自 己 过 于 所 当 看 的 。 要 照 着 神 所 分 给 各 人 信 心 的 大 小 ， 看 得 合 乎 中 道 。 [kjv] For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith. [bbe] But I say to every one of you, through the grace given to me, not to have an over-high opinion of himself, but to have wise thoughts, as God has given to every one a measure of faith. 12:4 [hgb] 正 如 我 们 一 个 身 子 上 有 好 些 肢 体 ， 肢 体 也 不 都 是 一 样 的 用 处 。 [kjv] For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office: [bbe] For, as we have a number of parts in one body, but all the parts have not the same use, 12:5 [hgb] 我 们 这 许 多 人 ， 在 基 督 里 成 为 一 身 ， 互 相 联 络 作 肢 体 ， 也 是 如 此 。 [kjv] So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another. [bbe] So we, though we are a number of persons, are one body in Christ, and are dependent on one another; 12:6 [hgb] 按 我 们 所 得 的 恩 赐 ， 各 有 不 同 。 或 说 预 言 ， 就 当 照 着 信 心 的 程 度 说 预 言 [kjv] Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith; [bbe] And having different qualities by reason of the grace given to us, such as the quality of a prophet, let it be made use of in relation to the measure of our faith; 12:7 [hgb] 或 作 执 事 ， 就 当 专 一 执 事 。 或 作 教 导 的 ， 就 当 专 一 教 导 。 [kjv] Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching; [bbe] Or the position of a Deacon of the church, let a man give himself to it; or he who has the power of teaching, let him make use of it; 12:8 [hgb] 或 作 劝 化 的 ， 就 当 专 一 劝 化 。 施 舍 的 就 当 诚 实 。 治 理 的 ， 就 当 殷 勤 。 怜 悯 人 的 ， 就 当 甘 心 。 [kjv] Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness. [bbe] He who has the power of comforting, let him do so; he who gives, let him give freely; he who has the power of ruling, let him do it with a serious mind; he who has mercy on others, let it be with joy. 12:9 [hgb] 爱 人 不 可 虚 假 ， 恶 要 厌 恶 ， 善 要 亲 近 。 [kjv] Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good. [bbe] Let love be without deceit. Be haters of what is evil; keep your minds fixed on what is good. 12:10 [hgb] 爱 弟 兄 ， 要 彼 此 亲 热 。 恭 敬 人 ， 要 彼 此 推 让 。 [kjv] Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another; [bbe] Be kind to one another with a brother\u0027s love, putting others before yourselves in honour; 12:11 [hgb] 殷 勤 不 可 懒 惰 。 要 心 里 火 热 。 常 常 服 事 主 。 [kjv] Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord; [bbe] Be not slow in your work, but be quick in spirit, as the Lord\u0027s servants; 12:12 [hgb] 在 指 望 中 要 喜 乐 。 在 患 难 中 要 忍 耐 。 祷 告 要 恒 切 。 [kjv] Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer; [bbe] Being glad in hope, quiet in trouble, at all times given to prayer, 12:13 [hgb] 圣 徒 缺 乏 要 帮 补 。 客 要 一 味 地 款 待 。 [kjv] Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality. [bbe] Giving to the needs of the saints, ready to take people into your houses. 12:14 [hgb] 逼 迫 你 们 的 ， 要 给 他 们 祝 福 。 只 要 祝 福 ， 不 可 咒 诅 。 [kjv] Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not. [bbe] Give blessing and not curses to those who are cruel to you. 12:15 [hgb] 与 喜 乐 的 人 要 同 乐 。 与 哀 哭 的 人 要 同 哭 。 [kjv] Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep. [bbe] Take part in the joy of those who are glad, and in the grief of those who are sorrowing. 12:16 [hgb] 要 彼 此 同 心 。 不 要 志 气 高 大 ， 倒 要 俯 就 卑 微 的 人 。 （ 人 或 作 事 ） 不 要 自 以 为 聪 明 。 [kjv] Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits. [bbe] Be in harmony with one another. Do not have a high opinion of yourselves, but be in agreement with common people. Do not give yourselves an air of wisdom. 12:17 [hgb] 不 要 以 恶 报 恶 ， 众 人 以 为 美 的 事 ， 要 留 心 去 作 。 [kjv] Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men. [bbe] Do not give evil for evil to any man. Let all your business be well ordered in the eyes of all men. 12:18 [hgb] 若 是 能 行 ， 总 要 尽 力 与 众 人 和 睦 。 [kjv] If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men. [bbe] As far as it is possible for you be at peace with all men. 12:19 [hgb] 亲 爱 的 弟 兄 ， 不 要 自 己 伸 冤 ， 宁 可 让 步 ， 听 凭 主 怒 。 （ 或 作 让 人 发 怒 ） 因 为 经 上 记 着 ， 主 说 ， 伸 冤 在 我 。 我 必 报 应 。 [kjv] Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord. [bbe] Do not give punishment for wrongs done to you, dear brothers, but give way to the wrath of God; for it is said in the holy Writings, Punishment is mine, I will give reward, says the Lord. 12:20 [hgb] 所 以 ， 你 的 仇 敌 若 饿 了 ， 就 给 他 吃 。 若 渴 了 ， 就 给 他 喝 。 因 为 你 这 样 行 ， 就 是 把 炭 火 堆 在 他 的 头 上 。 [kjv] Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head. [bbe] But if one who has hate for you is in need of food or of drink, give it to him, for in so doing you will put coals of fire on his head. 12:21 [hgb] 你 不 可 为 恶 所 胜 ， 反 要 以 善 胜 恶 。 [kjv] Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good. [bbe] Do not let evil overcome you, but overcome evil by good.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/162/2234.html","bookId":98,"book":{"id":98,"title":"罗马书 Romans","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 耶 稣 基 督 的 仆 人 保 罗 ， 奉 召 为 使 徒 ， 特 派 传 神 的 福 音 。 [kjv] Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God, \u0026nbs...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/162","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:30 AM"}}
