Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand. \n [bbe] Who are you to make yourself a judge of another man\u0027s servant? it is to his master that he is responsible for good or bad. Yes, his place will be safe, because the Lord is able to keep him from falling. \n 14:5 [hgb] 有 人 看 这 日 比 那 日 强 ， 有 人 看 日 日 都 是 一 样 。 只 是 各 人 心 里 要 意 见 坚 定 。 \n [kjv] One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind. \n [bbe] This man puts one day before another: to that man they are the same. Let every man be certain in his mind. \n 14:6 [hgb] 守 日 的 人 ， 是 为 主 守 的 。 吃 的 人 ， 是 为 主 吃 的 ， 因 他 感 谢 神 。 不 吃 的 人 ， 是 为 主 不 吃 的 ， 也 感 谢 神 。 \n [kjv] He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks. \n [bbe] He who keeps the day, keeps it to the Lord; and he who takes food, takes it as to the Lord, for he gives praise to God; and he who does not take food, to the Lord he takes it not, and gives praise to God. \n 14:7 [hgb] 我 们 没 有 一 个 人 为 自 己 活 ， 也 没 有 一 个 人 为 自 己 死 。 \n [kjv] For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself. \n [bbe] For every man\u0027s life and every man\u0027s death has a relation to others as well as to himself. \n 14:8 [hgb] 我 们 若 活 着 ， 是 为 主 而 活 。 若 死 了 ， 是 为 主 而 死 。 所 以 我 们 或 活 或 死 ， 总 是 主 的 人 。 \n [kjv] For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord\u0027s. \n [bbe] As long as we have life we are living to the Lord; or if we give up our life it is to the Lord; so if we are living, or if our life comes to an end, we are the Lord\u0027s. \n 14:9 [hgb] 因 此 基 督 死 了 ， 又 活 了 ， 为 要 作 死 人 并 活 人 的 主 。 \n [kjv] For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living. \n [bbe] And for this purpose Christ went into death and came back again, that he might be the Lord of the dead and of the living. \n 14:10 [hgb] 你 这 个 人 ， 为 什 么 论 断 弟 兄 呢 ？ 又 为 什 么 轻 看 弟 兄 呢 ？ 因 我 们 都 要 站 在 神 的 台 前 。 \n [kjv] But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ. \n [bbe] But you, why do you make yourself your brother\u0027s judge? or again, why have you no respect for your brother? because we will all have to take our place before God as our judge. \n 14:11 [hgb] 经 上 写 着 ， 主 说 ， 我 凭 着 我 的 永 生 起 誓 ， 万 膝 必 向 我 跪 拜 ， 万 口 必 向 我 承 认 。 \n [kjv] For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God. \n [bbe] For it is said in the holy Writings, By my life, says the Lord, to me every knee will be bent, and every tongue will give worship to God. \n 14:12 [hgb] 这 样 看 来 ， 我 们 各 人 必 要 将 自 己 的 事 ， 在 神 面 前 说 明 。 \n [kjv] So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God. \n [bbe] So every one of us will have to give an account of himself to God. \n 14:13 [hgb] 所 以 我 们 不 可 再 彼 此 论 断 。 宁 可 定 意 谁 也 不 给 弟 兄 放 下 绊 脚 跌 人 之 物 。 \n [kjv] Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother\u0027s way. \n [bbe] Then let us not be judges of one another any longer: but keep this in mind, that no man is to make it hard for his brother, or give him cause for doubting. \n 14:14 [hgb] 我 凭 着 主 耶 稣 确 知 深 信 ， 凡 物 本 来 没 有 不 洁 净 的 。 惟 独 人 以 为 不 洁 净 的 ， 在 他 就 不 洁 净 了 。 \n [kjv] I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean. \n [bbe] I am conscious of this, and am certain in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean in itself; but for the man in whose opinion it is unclean, for him it is unclean. \n 14:15 [hgb] 你 若 因 食 物 叫 弟 兄 忧 愁 ， 就 不 是 按 着 爱 人 的 道 理 行 。 基 督 已 经 替 他 死 ， 你 不 可 因 你 的 食 物 叫 他 败 坏 。 \n [kjv] But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died. \n [bbe] And if because of food your brother is troubled, then you are no longer going on in the way of love. Do not let your food be destruction to him for whom Christ went into death. \n 14:16 [hgb] 不 可 叫 你 的 善 被 人 毁 谤 。 \n [kjv] Let not then your good be evil spoken of: \n [bbe] Let it not be possible for men to say evil about your good: \n 14:17 [hgb] 因 为 神 的 国 ， 不 在 乎 吃 喝 ， 只 在 乎 公 义 ， 和 平 ， 并 圣 灵 中 的 喜 乐 。 \n [kjv] For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. \n [bbe] For the kingdom of God is not food and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. \n 14:18 [hgb] 在 这 几 样 上 服 事 基 督 的 ， 就 为 神 所 喜 悦 ， 又 为 人 所 称 许 。 \n [kjv] For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God, and approved of men. \n [bbe] And he who in these things is Christ\u0027s servant, is pleasing to God and has the approval of men. \n 14:19 [hgb] 所 以 我 们 务 要 追 求 和 睦 的 事 ， 与 彼 此 建 立 德 行 的 事 。 \n [kjv] Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another. \n [bbe] So then, let us go after the things which make peace, and the things by which we may be a help to one another. \n 14:20 [hgb] 不 可 因 食 物 毁 坏 神 的 工 程 。 凡 物 固 然 洁 净 ， 但 有 人 因 食 物 叫 人 跌 倒 ， 就 是 他 的 罪 了 。 \n [kjv] For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence. \n [bbe] Do not let the work of God come to nothing on account of food. All things are certainly clean; but it is evil for that man who by taking food makes it hard for another. \n 14:21 [hgb] 无 论 是 吃 肉 ， 是 喝 酒 ， 是 什 么 别 的 事 ， 叫 弟 兄 跌 倒 ， 一 概 不 作 才 好 。 \n [kjv] It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak. \n [bbe] It is better not to take meat or wine or to do anything which might be a cause of trouble to your brother. \n 14:22 [hgb] 你 有 信 心 ， 就 当 在 神 面 前 守 着 。 人 在 自 己 以 为 可 行 的 事 上 ， 能 不 自 责 ， 就 有 福 了 。 \n [kjv] Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth. \n [bbe] The faith which you have, have it to yourself before God. Happy is the man who is not judged by that to which he gives approval. \n 14:23 [hgb] 若 有 疑 心 而 吃 的 ， 就 必 有 罪 。 因 为 他 吃 ， 不 是 出 于 信 心 。 凡 不 出 于 信 心 的 都 是 罪 。 \n [kjv] And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin. \n [bbe] But he who is in doubt is judged if he takes food, because he does it not in faith; and whatever is not of faith is sin. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/162/2236.html","bookId":98,"book":{"id":98,"title":"罗马书 Romans","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 耶 稣 基 督 的 仆 人 保 罗 ， 奉 召 为 使 徒 ， 特 派 传 神 的 福 音 。 [kjv] Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God, \u0026nbs...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/162","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:30 AM"}}
