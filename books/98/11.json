{"id":2470,"no":11,"title":"Chapter 11","content":"11:1 [hgb] 我 且 说 ， 神 弃 绝 了 他 的 百 姓 吗 ？ 断 乎 没 有 。 因 为 我 也 是 以 色 列 人 ， 亚 伯 拉 罕 的 后 裔 ， 属 便 雅 悯 支 派 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. \\n\\n [bbe] So I say, Has God put his people on one side? Let there be no such thought. For I am of Israel, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. \\n\\n 11:2 [hgb] 神 并 没 有 弃 绝 他 预 先 所 知 道 的 百 姓 。 你 们 岂 不 晓 得 经 上 论 到 以 利 亚 是 怎 么 说 的 呢 ？ 他 在 神 面 前 怎 样 控 告 以 色 列 人 ， 说 ， \\n\\n [kjv] God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying, \\n\\n [bbe] God has not put away the people of his selection. Or have you no knowledge of what is said about Elijah in the holy Writings? how he says words to God against Israel, \\n\\n 11:3 [hgb] 主 阿 ， 他 们 杀 了 你 的 先 知 ， 拆 了 你 的 祭 坛 ， 只 剩 下 我 一 个 人 ， 他 们 还 要 寻 索 我 的 命 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life. \\n\\n [bbe] Lord, they have put your prophets to death, and made waste your altars, and now I am the last, and they are searching for me to take away my life. \\n\\n 11:4 [hgb] 神 的 回 话 是 怎 么 说 的 呢 ？ 他 说 ， 我 为 自 己 留 下 七 千 人 ， 是 未 曾 向 巴 力 屈 膝 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal. \\n\\n [bbe] But what answer does God make to him? I have still seven thousand men whose knees have not been bent to Baal. \\n\\n 11:5 [hgb] 如 今 也 是 这 样 ， 照 着 拣 选 的 恩 典 还 有 所 留 的 余 数 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace. \\n\\n [bbe] In the same way, there are at this present time some who are marked out by the selection of grace. \\n\\n 11:6 [hgb] 既 是 出 于 恩 典 ， 就 不 在 乎 行 为 。 不 然 ， 恩 典 就 不 是 恩 典 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work. \\n\\n [bbe] But if it is of grace, then it is no longer of works: or grace would not be grace. \\n\\n 11:7 [hgb] 这 是 怎 么 样 呢 ？ 以 色 列 人 所 求 的 ， 他 们 没 有 得 着 。 惟 有 蒙 拣 选 的 人 得 着 了 ， 其 余 的 就 成 了 顽 梗 不 化 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded. \\n\\n [bbe] What then? That which Israel was searching for he did not get, but those of the selection got it and the rest were made hard. \\n\\n 11:8 [hgb] 如 经 上 所 记 ， 神 给 他 们 昏 迷 的 心 ， 眼 睛 不 能 看 见 ， 耳 朵 不 能 听 见 ， 直 到 今 日 。 \\n\\n [kjv] (According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day. \\n\\n [bbe] As it was said in the holy Writings, God gave them a spirit of sleep, eyes which might not see, and ears which have no hearing, to this day. \\n\\n 11:9 [hgb] 大 卫 也 说 ， 愿 他 们 的 筵 席 变 为 网 罗 ， 变 为 机 槛 ， 变 为 绊 脚 石 ， 作 他 们 的 报 应 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them: \\n\\n [bbe] And David says, Let their table be made a net for taking them, and a stone in their way, and a punishment: \\n\\n 11:10 [hgb] 愿 他 们 的 眼 睛 昏 蒙 ， 不 得 看 见 。 愿 你 时 常 弯 下 他 们 的 腰 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway. \\n\\n [bbe] Let their eyes be made dark so that they may not see, and let their back be bent down at all times. \\n\\n 11:11 [hgb] 我 且 说 ， 他 们 失 脚 是 要 他 们 跌 倒 吗 ？ 断 乎 不 是 。 反 倒 因 他 们 的 过 失 ， 救 恩 便 临 到 外 邦 人 ， 要 激 动 他 们 发 愤 。 \\n\\n [kjv] I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy. \\n\\n [bbe] So I say, Were their steps made hard in order that they might have a fall? In no way: but by their fall salvation has come to the Gentiles, so that they might be moved to envy. \\n\\n 11:12 [hgb] 若 他 们 的 过 失 ， 为 天 下 的 富 足 ， 他 们 的 缺 乏 ， 为 外 邦 人 的 富 足 。 何 况 他 们 的 丰 满 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness? \\n\\n [bbe] Now, if their fall is the wealth of the world, and their loss the wealth of the Gentiles, how much greater will be the glory when they are made full? \\n\\n 11:13 [hgb] 我 对 你 们 外 邦 人 说 这 话 。 因 我 是 外 邦 人 的 使 徒 ， 所 以 敬 重 我 的 职 分 。 （ 敬 重 原 文 作 荣 耀 ） \\n\\n [kjv] For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office: \\n\\n [bbe] But I say to you, Gentiles, in so far as I am the Apostle of the Gentiles, I make much of my position: \\n\\n 11:14 [hgb] 或 者 可 以 激 动 我 骨 肉 之 亲 发 愤 ， 好 救 他 们 一 些 人 。 \\n\\n [kjv] If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might save some of them. \\n\\n [bbe] If in any way those who are of my flesh may be moved to envy, so that some of them may get salvation by me. \\n\\n 11:15 [hgb] 若 他 们 被 丢 弃 ， 天 下 就 得 与 神 和 好 ， 他 们 被 收 纳 ， 岂 不 是 死 而 复 生 吗 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead? \\n\\n [bbe] For, if by their putting away, the rest of men have been made friends with God, what will their coming back again be, but life from the dead? \\n\\n 11:16 [hgb] 所 献 的 新 面 ， 若 是 圣 洁 ， 全 团 也 就 圣 洁 了 。 树 根 若 是 圣 洁 ， 树 枝 也 就 圣 洁 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches. \\n\\n [bbe] And if the first-fruit is holy, so is the mass: and if the root is holy, so are the branches. \\n\\n 11:17 [hgb] 若 有 几 根 枝 子 被 折 下 来 ， 你 这 野 橄 榄 得 接 在 其 中 ， 一 同 得 着 橄 榄 根 的 肥 汁 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree; \\n\\n [bbe] But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, an olive-tree of the fields, were put in among them, and were given a part with them in the root by which the olive-tree is made fertile, \\n\\n 11:18 [hgb] 你 就 不 可 向 旧 枝 子 夸 口 ， 若 是 夸 口 ， 当 知 道 不 是 你 托 着 根 ， 乃 是 根 托 着 你 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee. \\n\\n [bbe] Do not be uplifted in pride over the branches: because it is not you who are the support of the root, but it is by the root that you are supported. \\n\\n 11:19 [hgb] 你 若 说 ， 那 枝 子 被 折 下 来 ， 是 特 为 叫 我 接 上 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in. \\n\\n [bbe] You will say, Branches were broken off so that I might be put in. \\n\\n 11:20 [hgb] 不 错 。 他 们 因 为 不 信 ， 所 以 被 折 下 来 。 你 因 为 信 ， 所 以 立 得 住 。 你 不 可 自 高 ， 反 要 惧 怕 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear: \\n\\n [bbe] Truly, because they had no faith they were broken off, and you have your place by reason of your faith. Do not be lifted up in pride, but have fear; \\n\\n 11:21 [hgb] 神 既 不 爱 惜 原 来 的 枝 子 ， 也 必 不 爱 惜 你 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee. \\n\\n [bbe] For, if God did not have mercy on the natural branches, he will not have mercy on you. \\n\\n 11:22 [hgb] 可 见 神 的 恩 慈 ， 和 严 厉 。 向 那 跌 倒 的 人 ， 是 严 厉 的 。 向 你 是 有 恩 慈 的 ， 只 要 你 长 久 在 他 的 恩 慈 里 。 不 然 ， 你 也 要 被 砍 下 来 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off. \\n\\n [bbe] See then that God is good but his rules are fixed: to those who were put away he was hard, but to you he has been good, on the condition that you keep in his mercy; if not, you will be cut off as they were. \\n\\n 11:23 [hgb] 而 且 他 们 若 不 是 长 久 不 信 ， 仍 要 被 接 上 。 因 为 神 能 够 把 他 们 从 新 接 上 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again. \\n\\n [bbe] And they, if they do not go on without faith, will be united to the tree again, because God is able to put them in again. \\n\\n 11:24 [hgb] 你 是 从 那 天 生 的 野 橄 榄 上 砍 下 来 的 ， 尚 且 逆 着 性 得 接 在 好 橄 榄 上 ， 何 况 这 本 树 的 枝 子 ， 要 接 在 本 树 上 呢 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be graffed into their own olive tree? \\n\\n [bbe] For if you were cut out of a field olive-tree, and against the natural use were united to a good olive-tree, how much more will these, the natural branches, be united again with the olive-tree which was theirs? \\n\\n 11:25 [hgb] 弟 兄 们 ， 我 不 愿 意 你 们 不 知 道 这 奥 秘 ， （ 恐 怕 你 们 自 以 为 聪 明 ） 就 是 以 色 列 人 有 几 分 是 硬 心 的 ， 等 到 外 邦 人 的 数 目 添 满 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in. \\n\\n [bbe] For it is my desire, brothers, that this secret may be clear to you, so that you may not have pride in your knowledge, that Israel has been made hard in part, till all the Gentiles have come in; \\n\\n 11:26 [hgb] 于 是 以 色 列 全 家 都 要 得 救 ， 如 经 上 所 记 ， 必 有 一 位 救 主 ， 从 锡 安 出 来 ， 要 消 除 雅 各 家 的 一 切 罪 恶 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob: \\n\\n [bbe] And so all Israel will get salvation: as it is said in the holy Writings, There will come out of Zion the One who makes free; by him wrongdoing will be taken away from Jacob: \\n\\n 11:27 [hgb] 又 说 ， 我 除 去 他 们 罪 的 时 候 ， 这 就 是 我 与 他 们 所 立 的 约 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins. \\n\\n [bbe] And this is my agreement with them, when I will take away their sins. \\n\\n 11:28 [hgb] 就 着 福 音 说 ， 他 们 为 你 们 的 缘 故 是 仇 敌 。 就 着 拣 选 说 ， 他 们 为 列 祖 的 缘 故 是 蒙 爱 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers\u0027 sakes. \\n\\n [bbe] As far as the good news is in question, they are cut off from God on account of you, but as far as the selection is in question, they are loved on account of the fathers. \\n\\n 11:29 [hgb] 因 为 神 的 恩 赐 和 选 召 ， 是 没 有 后 悔 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance. \\n\\n [bbe] Because God\u0027s selection and his mercies may not be changed. \\n\\n 11:30 [hgb] 你 们 从 前 不 顺 服 神 ， 如 今 因 他 们 的 不 顺 服 ， 你 们 倒 蒙 了 怜 恤 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief: \\n\\n [bbe] For as you, in time past, were not under the rule of God, but now have got mercy through their turning away, \\n\\n 11:31 [hgb] 这 样 ， 他 们 也 是 不 顺 服 ， 叫 他 们 因 着 施 给 你 们 的 怜 恤 ， 现 在 也 就 蒙 怜 恤 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy. \\n\\n [bbe] So in the same way these have gone against the orders of God, so that by the mercy given to you they may now get mercy. \\n\\n 11:32 [hgb] 因 为 神 将 众 人 都 圈 在 不 顺 服 之 中 ， 特 意 要 怜 恤 众 人 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all. \\n\\n [bbe] For God has let them all go against his orders, so that he might have mercy on them all. \\n\\n 11:33 [hgb] 深 哉 ， 神 丰 富 的 智 慧 和 知 识 。 他 的 判 断 ， 何 其 难 测 ， 他 的 踪 迹 ， 何 其 难 寻 ， \\n\\n [kjv] O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out! \\n\\n [bbe] O how deep is the wealth of the wisdom and knowledge of God! no one is able to make discovery of his decisions, and his ways may not be searched out. \\n\\n 11:34 [hgb] 谁 知 道 主 的 心 ？ 谁 作 过 他 的 谋 士 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor? \\n\\n [bbe] Who has knowledge of the mind of the Lord? or who has taken part in his purposes? \\n\\n 11:35 [hgb] 谁 是 先 给 了 他 ， 使 他 后 来 偿 还 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again? \\n\\n [bbe] Or who has first given to him, and it will be given back to him again? \\n\\n 11:36 [hgb] 因 为 万 有 都 是 本 于 他 ， 倚 靠 他 ， 归 于 他 。 愿 荣 耀 归 给 他 ， 直 到 永 远 。 阿 们 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen. \\n\\n [bbe] For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things. To him be the glory for ever. So be it. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/162/2233.html","bookId":98,"book":{"id":98,"title":"罗马书 Romans","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 耶 稣 基 督 的 仆 人 保 罗 ， 奉 召 为 使 徒 ， 特 派 传 神 的 福 音 。 [kjv] Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God, \u0026nbs...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/162","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:30 AM"}}
