{"id":2469,"no":10,"title":"Chapter 10","content":"10:1 [hgb] 弟 兄 们 ， 我 心 里 所 愿 的 ， 向 神 所 求 的 ， 是 要 以 色 列 人 得 救 。 \n [kjv] Brethren, my heart\u0027s desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved. \n [bbe] Brothers, my heart\u0027s desire and my prayer to God for them is, that they may get salvation. \n 10:2 [hgb] 我 可 以 证 明 他 们 向 神 有 热 心 ， 但 不 是 按 着 真 知 识 。 \n [kjv] For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge. \n [bbe] For I give witness of them that they have a strong desire for God, but not with knowledge. \n 10:3 [hgb] 因 为 不 知 道 神 的 义 ， 想 要 立 自 己 的 义 ， 就 不 服 神 的 义 了 。 \n [kjv] For they being ignorant of God\u0027s righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God. \n [bbe] Because, not having knowledge of God\u0027s righteousness, and desiring to give effect to their righteousness, they have not put themselves under the righteousness of God. \n 10:4 [hgb] 律 法 的 总 结 就 是 基 督 ， 使 凡 信 他 的 都 得 着 义 。 \n [kjv] For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth. \n [bbe] For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who has faith. \n 10:5 [hgb] 摩 西 写 着 说 ， 人 若 行 那 出 于 律 法 的 义 ， 就 必 因 此 活 着 。 \n [kjv] For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which doeth those things shall live by them. \n [bbe] For Moses says that the man who does the righteousness which is of the law will get life by it. \n 10:6 [hgb] 惟 有 出 于 信 心 的 义 如 此 说 ， 你 不 要 心 里 说 ， 谁 要 升 到 天 上 去 呢 ？ 就 是 要 领 下 基 督 来 。 \n [kjv] But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above:) \n [bbe] But the righteousness which is of faith says these words, Say not in your heart, Who will go up to heaven? (that is, to make Christ come down:) \n 10:7 [hgb] 谁 要 下 到 阴 间 去 呢 ？ 就 是 要 领 基 督 从 死 里 上 来 。 \n [kjv] Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.) \n [bbe] Or, Who will go down into the deep? (that is, to make Christ come again from the dead:) \n 10:8 [hgb] 他 到 底 怎 么 说 呢 ？ 他 说 ， 这 道 离 你 不 远 ， 正 在 你 口 里 ， 在 你 心 里 。 就 是 我 们 所 传 信 主 的 道 。 \n [kjv] But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach; \n [bbe] But what does it say? The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart: that is, the word of faith of which we are the preachers: \n 10:9 [hgb] 你 若 口 里 认 耶 稣 为 主 ， 心 里 信 神 叫 他 从 死 里 复 活 ， 就 必 得 救 。 \n [kjv] That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. \n [bbe] Because, if you say with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and have faith in your heart that God has made him come back from the dead, you will have salvation: \n 10:10 [hgb] 因 为 人 心 里 相 信 ， 就 可 以 称 义 。 口 里 承 认 ， 就 可 以 得 救 。 \n [kjv] For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. \n [bbe] For with the heart man has faith to get righteousness, and with the mouth he says that Jesus is Lord to get salvation. \n 10:11 [hgb] 经 上 说 ， 凡 信 他 的 人 ， 必 不 至 于 羞 愧 。 \n [kjv] For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. \n [bbe] Because it is said in the holy Writings, Whoever has faith in him will not be shamed. \n 10:12 [hgb] 犹 太 人 和 希 利 尼 人 ， 并 没 有 分 别 。 因 为 众 人 同 有 一 位 主 ， 他 也 厚 待 一 切 求 告 他 的 人 。 \n [kjv] For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. \n [bbe] And the Jew is not different from the Greek: for there is the same Lord of all, who is good to all who have hope in his name: \n 10:13 [hgb] 因 为 凡 求 告 主 名 的 ， 就 必 得 救 。 \n [kjv] For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. \n [bbe] Because, Whoever will give worship to the name of the Lord will get salvation. \n 10:14 [hgb] 然 而 人 未 曾 信 他 ， 怎 能 求 他 呢 ？ 未 曾 听 见 他 ， 怎 能 信 他 呢 ？ 没 有 传 道 的 ， 怎 能 听 见 呢 ？ \n [kjv] How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher? \n [bbe] But how will they give worship to him in whom they have no faith? and how will they have faith in him of whom they have not had news? and how will they have news without a preacher? \n 10:15 [hgb] 若 没 有 奉 差 遣 ， 怎 能 传 道 呢 ？ 如 经 上 所 记 ， 报 福 音 传 喜 信 的 人 ， 他 们 的 脚 踪 何 等 佳 美 ， \n [kjv] And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things! \n [bbe] And how will there be preachers if they are not sent? As it is said, How beautiful are the feet of those who give the glad news of good things. \n 10:16 [hgb] 只 是 人 没 有 都 听 从 福 音 。 因 为 以 赛 亚 说 ， 主 阿 ， 我 们 所 传 的 有 谁 信 呢 ？ \n [kjv] But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report? \n [bbe] But they have not all given ear to the good news. For Isaiah says, Lord, who has had faith in our word? \n 10:17 [hgb] 可 见 信 道 是 从 听 道 来 的 ， 听 道 是 从 基 督 的 话 来 的 。 \n [kjv] So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. \n [bbe] So faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ. \n 10:18 [hgb] 但 我 说 ， 人 没 有 听 见 吗 ？ 诚 然 听 见 了 。 他 们 的 声 音 传 遍 天 下 ， 他 们 的 言 语 传 到 地 极 。 \n [kjv] But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world. \n [bbe] But I say, Did not the word come to their ears? Yes, certainly: Their sound has gone out into all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world. \n 10:19 [hgb] 我 再 说 ， 以 色 列 人 不 知 道 吗 ？ 先 有 摩 西 说 ， 我 要 用 那 不 成 子 民 的 ， 惹 动 你 们 的 愤 恨 。 我 要 用 那 无 知 的 民 ， 触 动 你 们 的 怒 气 。 \n [kjv] But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a foolish nation I will anger you. \n [bbe] But I say, Had Israel no knowledge? First Moses says, You will be moved to envy by that which is not a nation, and by a foolish people I will make you angry. \n 10:20 [hgb] 又 有 以 赛 亚 放 胆 说 ， 没 有 寻 找 我 的 ， 我 叫 他 们 遇 见 。 没 有 访 问 我 的 ， 我 向 他 们 显 现 。 \n [kjv] But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me. \n [bbe] And Isaiah says without fear, Those who were not searching for me made discovery of me; and I was seen by those whose hearts were turned away from me. \n 10:21 [hgb] 至 于 以 色 列 人 ， 他 说 ， 我 整 天 伸 手 招 呼 那 悖 逆 顶 嘴 的 百 姓 。 \n [kjv] But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people. \n [bbe] But about Israel he says; All the day my hands have been stretched out to a people whose hearts were turned away, and who put themselves against my word. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/162/2232.html","bookId":98,"book":{"id":98,"title":"罗马书 Romans","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 耶 稣 基 督 的 仆 人 保 罗 ， 奉 召 为 使 徒 ， 特 派 传 神 的 福 音 。 [kjv] Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God, \u0026nbs...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/162","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:30 AM"}}
