For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many. \\n\\n [bbe] But the free giving of God is not like the wrongdoing of man. For if, by the wrongdoing of one man death came to numbers of men, much more did the grace of God, and the free giving by the grace of one man, Jesus Christ, come to men. \\n\\n 5:16 [hgb] 因 一 人 犯 罪 就 定 罪 ， 也 不 如 恩 赐 。 原 来 审 判 是 由 一 人 而 定 罪 ， 恩 赐 乃 是 由 许 多 过 犯 而 称 义 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences unto justification. \\n\\n [bbe] And the free giving has not the same effect as the sin of one: for the effect of one man\u0027s sin was punishment by the decision of God, but the free giving had power to give righteousness to wrongdoers in great number. \\n\\n 5:17 [hgb] 若 因 一 人 的 过 犯 ， 死 就 因 这 一 人 作 了 王 ， 何 况 那 些 受 洪 恩 又 蒙 所 赐 之 义 的 ， 岂 不 更 要 因 耶 稣 基 督 一 人 在 生 命 中 作 王 吗 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] For if by one man\u0027s offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.) \\n\\n [bbe] For, if by the wrongdoing of one, death was ruling through the one, much more will those to whom has come the wealth of grace and the giving of righteousness, be ruling in life through the one, even Jesus Christ. \\n\\n 5:18 [hgb] 如 此 说 来 ， 因 一 次 的 过 犯 ， 众 人 都 被 定 罪 ， 照 样 ， 因 一 次 的 义 行 ， 众 人 也 就 被 称 义 得 生 命 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life. \\n\\n [bbe] So then, as the effect of one act of wrongdoing was that punishment came on all men, even so the effect of one act of righteousness was righteousness of life for all men. \\n\\n 5:19 [hgb] 因 一 人 的 悖 逆 ， 众 人 成 为 罪 人 ， 照 样 ， 因 一 人 的 顺 从 ， 众 人 也 成 为 义 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For as by one man\u0027s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous. \\n\\n [bbe] Because, as numbers of men became sinners through the wrongdoing of one man, even so will great numbers get righteousness through the keeping of the word of God by one man. \\n\\n 5:20 [hgb] 律 法 本 是 外 添 的 ， 叫 过 犯 显 多 。 只 是 罪 在 哪 里 显 多 ， 恩 典 就 更 显 多 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound: \\n\\n [bbe] And the law came in addition, to make wrongdoing worse; but where there was much sin, there was much more grace: \\n\\n 5:21 [hgb] 就 如 罪 作 王 叫 人 死 ， 照 样 恩 典 也 借 着 义 作 王 ， 叫 人 因 我 们 的 主 耶 稣 基 督 得 永 生 。 \\n\\n [kjv] That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord. \\n\\n [bbe] That, as sin had power in death, so grace might have power through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/162/2227.html","bookId":98,"book":{"id":98,"title":"罗马书 Romans","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 耶 稣 基 督 的 仆 人 保 罗 ， 奉 召 为 使 徒 ， 特 派 传 神 的 福 音 。 [kjv] Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God, \u0026nbs...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/162","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:30 AM"}}
