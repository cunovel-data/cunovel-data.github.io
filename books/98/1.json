{"id":2460,"no":1,"title":"Chapter 1","content":"1:1 [hgb] 耶 稣 基 督 的 仆 人 保 罗 ， 奉 召 为 使 徒 ， 特 派 传 神 的 福 音 。 \n [kjv] Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God, \n [bbe] Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, an Apostle by the selection of God, given authority as a preacher of the good news, \n 1:2 [hgb] 这 福 音 是 神 从 前 借 众 先 知 ， 在 圣 经 上 所 应 许 的 。 \n [kjv] (Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,) \n [bbe] Of which God had given word before by his prophets in the holy Writings, \n 1:3 [hgb] 论 到 他 儿 子 ， 我 主 耶 稣 基 督 。 按 肉 体 说 ， 是 从 大 卫 后 裔 生 的 。 \n [kjv] Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh; \n [bbe] About his Son who, in the flesh, came from the family of David, \n 1:4 [hgb] 按 圣 善 的 灵 说 ， 因 从 死 里 复 活 ， 以 大 能 显 明 是 神 的 儿 子 。 \n [kjv] And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead: \n [bbe] But was marked out as Son of God in power by the Holy Spirit through the coming to life again of the dead; Jesus Christ our Lord, \n 1:5 [hgb] 我 们 从 他 受 了 恩 惠 ， 并 使 徒 的 职 分 ， 在 万 国 之 中 叫 人 为 他 的 名 信 服 真 道 。 \n [kjv] By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name: \n [bbe] Through whom grace has been given to us, sending us out to make disciples to the faith among all nations, for his name: \n 1:6 [hgb] 其 中 也 有 你 们 这 蒙 召 属 耶 稣 基 督 的 人 。 \n [kjv] Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ: \n [bbe] Among whom you in the same way have been marked out to be disciples of Jesus Christ: \n 1:7 [hgb] 我 写 信 给 你 们 在 罗 马 为 神 所 爱 ， 奉 召 作 圣 徒 的 众 人 。 愿 恩 惠 平 安 ， 从 我 们 的 父 神 ， 并 主 耶 稣 基 督 ， 归 与 你 们 。 \n [kjv] To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. \n [bbe] To all those who are in Rome, loved by God, marked out as saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. \n 1:8 [hgb] 第 一 ， 我 靠 着 耶 稣 基 督 ， 为 你 们 众 人 感 谢 我 的 神 。 因 你 们 的 信 德 传 遍 了 天 下 。 \n [kjv] First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world. \n [bbe] First of all, I give praise to my God through Jesus Christ for you all, because news of your faith has gone into all the world. \n 1:9 [hgb] 我 在 他 儿 子 福 音 上 ， 用 心 灵 所 事 奉 的 神 ， 可 以 见 证 我 怎 样 不 住 地 提 到 你 们 ， \n [kjv] For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers; \n [bbe] For God is my witness, whose servant I am in spirit in the good news of his Son, that you are at all times in my memory and in my prayers, \n 1:10 [hgb] 在 祷 告 之 间 ， 常 常 恳 求 ， 或 者 照 神 的 旨 意 ， 终 能 得 平 坦 的 道 路 往 你 们 那 里 去 。 \n [kjv] Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you. \n [bbe] And that I am ever making prayers that God will give me a good journey to you. \n 1:11 [hgb] 因 为 我 切 切 地 想 见 你 们 ， 要 把 些 属 灵 的 恩 赐 分 给 你 们 ， 使 你 们 可 以 坚 固 。 \n [kjv] For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established; \n [bbe] For I have a strong desire to see you, and to give you some grace of the spirit, so that you may be made strong; \n 1:12 [hgb] 这 样 我 在 你 们 中 间 ， 因 你 与 我 彼 此 的 信 心 ， 就 可 以 同 得 安 慰 。 \n [kjv] That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me. \n [bbe] That is to say, that all of us may be comforted together by the faith which is in you and in me. \n 1:13 [hgb] 弟 兄 们 ， 我 不 愿 意 你 们 不 知 道 ， 我 屡 次 定 意 往 你 们 那 里 去 ， 要 在 你 们 中 间 得 些 果 子 ， 如 同 在 其 余 的 外 邦 人 中 一 样 。 只 是 到 如 今 仍 有 阻 隔 。 \n [kjv] Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles. \n [bbe] You may be certain, my brothers, that it has frequently been in my mind to come to you (but till now I was kept from it), so that I might have some fruit from you in the same way as I have had it from the other nations. \n 1:14 [hgb] 无 论 是 希 利 尼 人 ， 化 外 人 ， 聪 明 人 ， 愚 拙 人 ， 我 都 欠 他 们 的 债 。 \n [kjv] I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise. \n [bbe] I have a debt to Greeks and to the nations outside; to the wise and to those who have no learning. \n 1:15 [hgb] 所 以 情 愿 尽 我 的 力 量 ， 将 福 音 也 传 给 你 们 在 罗 马 的 人 。 \n [kjv] So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also. \n [bbe] For which reason I have the desire, as far as I am able, to give the knowledge of the good news to you who are in Rome. \n 1:16 [hgb] 我 不 以 福 音 为 耻 。 这 福 音 本 是 神 的 大 能 ， 要 救 一 切 相 信 的 ， 先 是 犹 太 人 ， 后 是 希 利 尼 人 。 \n [kjv] For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. \n [bbe] For I have no feeling of shame about the good news, because it is the power of God giving salvation to everyone who has faith, to the Jew first, and then to the Greek. \n 1:17 [hgb] 因 为 神 的 义 ， 正 在 这 福 音 上 显 明 出 来 。 这 义 是 本 于 信 以 致 于 信 。 如 经 上 所 记 ， 义 人 必 因 信 得 生 。 \n [kjv] For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith. \n [bbe] For in it there is the revelation of the righteousness of God from faith to faith: as it is said in the holy Writings, The man who does righteousness will be living by his faith. \n 1:18 [hgb] 原 来 神 的 忿 怒 ， 从 天 上 显 明 在 一 切 不 虔 不 义 的 人 身 上 ， 就 是 那 些 行 不 义 阻 挡 真 理 的 人 。 \n [kjv] For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness; \n [bbe] For there is a revelation of the wrath of God from heaven against all the wrongdoing and evil thoughts of men who keep down what is true by wrongdoing; \n 1:19 [hgb] 神 的 事 情 ， 人 所 能 知 道 的 ， 原 显 明 在 人 心 里 。 因 为 神 已 经 给 他 们 显 明 。 \n [kjv] Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them. \n [bbe] Because the knowledge of God may be seen in them, God having made it clear to them. \n 1:20 [hgb] 自 从 造 天 地 以 来 ， 神 的 永 能 和 神 性 是 明 明 可 知 的 ， 虽 是 眼 不 能 见 ， 但 借 着 所 造 之 物 ， 就 可 以 晓 得 ， 叫 人 无 可 推 诿 。 \n [kjv] For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse: \n [bbe] For from the first making of the world, those things of God which the eye is unable to see, that is, his eternal power and existence, are fully made clear, he having given the knowledge of them through the things which he has made, so that men have no reason for wrongdoing: \n 1:21 [hgb] 因 为 他 们 虽 然 知 道 神 ， 却 不 当 作 神 荣 耀 他 ， 也 不 感 谢 他 。 他 们 的 思 念 变 为 虚 妄 ， 无 知 的 心 就 昏 暗 了 。 \n [kjv] Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. \n [bbe] Because, having the knowledge of God, they did not give glory to God as God, and did not give praise, but their minds were full of foolish things, and their hearts, being without sense, were made dark. \n 1:22 [hgb] 自 称 为 聪 明 ， 反 成 了 愚 拙 ， \n [kjv] Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, \n [bbe] Seeming to be wise, they were in fact foolish, \n 1:23 [hgb] 将 不 能 朽 坏 之 神 的 荣 耀 变 为 偶 像 ， 仿 佛 必 朽 坏 的 人 ， 和 飞 禽 走 兽 昆 虫 的 样 式 。 \n [kjv] And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things. \n [bbe] And by them the glory of the eternal God was changed and made into the image of man who is not eternal, and of birds and beasts and things which go on the earth. \n 1:24 [hgb] 所 以 神 任 凭 他 们 ， 逞 着 心 里 的 情 欲 行 污 秽 的 事 ， 以 致 彼 此 玷 辱 自 己 的 身 体 。 \n [kjv] Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves: \n [bbe] For this reason God gave them up to the evil desires of their hearts, working shame in their bodies with one another: \n 1:25 [hgb] 他 们 将 神 的 真 实 变 为 虚 谎 ， 去 敬 拜 事 奉 受 造 之 物 ， 不 敬 奉 那 造 物 的 主 。 主 乃 是 可 称 颂 的 ， 直 到 永 远 。 阿 们 。 \n [kjv] Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen. \n [bbe] Because by them the true word of God was changed into that which is false, and they gave worship and honour to the thing which is made, and not to him who made it, to whom be blessing for ever. So be it. \n 1:26 [hgb] 因 此 神 任 凭 他 们 放 纵 可 羞 耻 的 情 欲 。 他 们 的 女 人 ， 把 顺 性 的 用 处 ， 变 为 逆 性 的 用 处 。 \n [kjv] For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: \n [bbe] For this reason God gave them up to evil passions, and their women were changing the natural use into one which is unnatural: \n 1:27 [hgb] 男 人 也 是 如 此 ， 弃 了 女 人 顺 性 的 用 处 ， 欲 火 攻 心 ， 彼 此 贪 恋 ， 男 和 男 行 可 羞 耻 的 事 ， 就 在 自 己 身 上 受 这 妄 为 当 得 的 报 应 。 \n [kjv] And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet. \n [bbe] And in the same way the men gave up the natural use of the woman and were burning in their desire for one another, men doing shame with men, and getting in their bodies the right reward of their evil-doing. \n 1:28 [hgb] 他 们 既 然 故 意 不 认 识 神 ， 神 就 任 凭 他 们 存 邪 僻 的 心 行 那 些 不 合 理 的 事 ， \n [kjv] And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient; \n [bbe] And because they had not the mind to keep God in their knowledge, God gave them up to an evil mind, to do those things which are not right; \n 1:29 [hgb] 装 满 了 各 样 不 义 ， 邪 恶 ， 贪 婪 ， 恶 毒 （ 或 作 阴 毒 ） 。 满 心 是 嫉 妒 ， 凶 杀 ， 争 竞 ， 诡 诈 ， 毒 恨 。 \n [kjv] Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers, \n [bbe] Being full of all wrongdoing, evil, desire for the goods of others, hate, envy, putting to death, fighting, deceit, cruel ways, evil talk, and false statements about others; \n 1:30 [hgb] 又 是 谗 毁 的 ， 背 后 说 人 的 ， 怨 恨 神 的 （ 或 作 被 神 所 憎 恶 的 ） ， 侮 慢 人 的 ， 狂 傲 的 ， 自 夸 的 ， 捏 造 恶 事 的 ， 违 背 父 母 的 ， \n [kjv] Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, \n [bbe] Hated by God, full of pride, without respect, full of loud talk, given to evil inventions, not honouring father or mother, \n 1:31 [hgb] 无 知 的 ， 背 约 的 ， 无 亲 情 的 ， 不 怜 悯 人 的 。 \n [kjv] Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful: \n [bbe] Without knowledge, not true to their undertakings, unkind, having no mercy: \n 1:32 [hgb] 他 们 虽 知 道 神 判 定 ， 行 这 样 事 的 人 是 当 死 的 ， 然 而 他 们 不 但 自 己 去 行 ， 还 喜 欢 别 人 去 行 。 \n [kjv] Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them. \n [bbe] Who, though they have knowledge of the law of God, that the fate of those who do these things is death, not only go on doing these things themselves, but give approval to those who do them. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/162/2223.html","bookId":98,"book":{"id":98,"title":"罗马书 Romans","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 耶 稣 基 督 的 仆 人 保 罗 ， 奉 召 为 使 徒 ， 特 派 传 神 的 福 音 。 [kjv] Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God, \u0026nbs...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/162","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:30 AM"}}
