{"id":39935,"no":1,"title":"EDITOR\u0027S NOTE","content":"General von Bernhardi is best known in England as a writer of the \"Jingo\" School which has done so much to produce the war, but this is only one side of his literary activity. He is also a writer of recognised ability on the theory and practice of modern war. Sir John French\u0027s introduction to the present work is sufficient testimony to the value which is set upon his purely professional writings. General von Bernhardi is a distinguished cavalry officer, and he writes with remarkable independence on the special work of his own arm, never hesitating to criticise the regulations of the German Army, when he considers that they do not correspond to the actual conditions of war. The book, though written in the first instance for cavalry officers, will be found of interest to all who wish to understand what cavalry is called upon to do and how it does it in the war of to-day. It will be found to be full of useful instruction for not only officers of the regular cavalry and the yeomanry, but also for officers and non-commissioned officers of our cyclist battalions, whose work brings them into such close relation with our cavalry in war and man?uvres, and who have to perform much the same work as that of the cavalry in reconnaissance, screening, and outpost duties. General von Bernhardi\u0027s work deals with cavalry in war and peace, but much of the second part, dealing with peace duties and training, is made up of a mass[Pg 6] of detail on parade and riding-school work, as carried out in the German Army. This has been omitted, but his remarks on cavalry training at man?uvres are included in an appendix. Sir John French\u0027s introduction gives us the views of the greatest of our own cavalry leaders, who is now commanding our Army in France. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2783/77111.html","bookId":1309,"book":{"id":1309,"title":"Cavalry - A Popular Edition of \"Cavalry in War and Peace\"","description":"简介： General von Bernhardi is best known in England as a writer of the Jingo School which has done so much to produce the war, but this is only one side of his literary activity.
