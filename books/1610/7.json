{"id":93202,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"After about 0.1 millisecond (one ten-thousandth part of a second) has elapsed, the radius of the ball of fire is some 45 feet, and the temperature is then in the vicinity of 800,000 degrees Centigrade. At this instant, the luminosity, as observed at a distance of 100,000 yards (5.7 miles), is approximately 100 times that of the sun as seen at the earth\u0027s surface... the ball of fire expands very rapidly to its maximum radius of 450 feet within less than a second from the explosion.\\n\\n - Los Alamos\\n\\n TIME TO THINK\\n\\n Brother, that was all we needed to make everybody but Kaby and the two ETs start yelping at once, me included. It may seem strange that Change People, able to whiz through time and space and roust around outside the cosmos and knowing at least by hearsay of weapons a billion years in the future, like the Mindbomb, should panic at being shut in with a little primitive mid-20th Century gadget. Well, they feel the same as atomic scientists would feel if a Bengal tiger were brought into their laboratory, neither more nor less scared.\\n\\n I\u0027m a moron at physics, but I do know the Fireball is bigger than the Place. Remember that, besides the bomb, we\u0027d recently been presented with a lot of other fears we hadn\u0027t had time to cope with, especially the business of the Snakes having learned how to get at our Places and melt the Maintainers and collapse them. Not to mention the general impression - first Saint Petersburg, then Crete - that the whole Change War was going against the Spiders.\\n\\n Yet, in a free corner of my mind, I was shocked at how badly we were all panicking. It made me admit what I didn\u0027t like to: that we were all in pretty much the same state as Doc, except that the bottle didn\u0027t happen to be our out.\\n\\n And had the rest of us been controlling our drinking so well lately?\\n\\n Maud yelled, \"Jettison and pulled away from the satyr and ran from the bronze chest. Beau, harking back to what they\u0027d thought of doing in the Express Room when it was too late, hissed, \"Sirs, we must Introvert,\" and vaulted over the piano bench and legged it for the control divan. Erich seconded him with a white-faced \"Gott in Himmel, ja!\" from beside the surly, forgotten Countess, holding, by its slim stem, an empty, rose-stained wine glass.\\n\\n I felt my mind flinch, because Introverting a Place is several degrees worse than foxholing. It\u0027s supposed not only to keep the Door tight shut, but also to lock it so even the Change Winds can\u0027t get through - cut the Place loose from the cosmos altogether.\\n\\n I\u0027d never talked with anyone from a Place that had been Introverted.\\n\\n Mark dumped Phryne off his lap and ran after Maud. The Greek Ghostgirl, quite solid now, looked around with sleepy fear and fumbled her applegreen chiton together at the throat. She wrenched my attention away from everyone else for a moment, and I couldn\u0027t help wondering whether the person or Zombie back in the cosmos, from whose lifeline the Ghost has been taken, doesn\u0027t at least have strange dreams or thoughts when something like this happens.\\n\\n Sid stopped Beau, though he almost got bowled over doing it, and he held the gambler away from the Maintainer in a bear hug and bellowed over his shoulders, \"Masters, are you mad? Have you lost your wits? Maud! Mark! Marcus! Magdalene! On your lives, unhand that casket!\"\\n\\n Maud had swept the clothes and bows and quivers and stuff off it and was dragging it out from the bar toward the Door sector, so as to dump it through fast when we got one, I guess, while Mark acted as if he were trying to help her and wrestle it away from her at the same time.\\n\\n They kept on as if they hadn\u0027t heard a word Sid said, with Mark yelling, \"Let go, meretrix! This holds Rome\u0027s answer to Parthia on the Nile.\"\\n\\n Kaby watched them as if she wanted to help Mark but scorned to scuffle with a mere - well, Mark had said it in Latin, I guess - call girl.\\n\\n Then, on the top of the bronze chest, I saw those seven lousy skulls starting at the lock as plain as if they\u0027d been under a magnifying glass, though ordinarily they\u0027d have been a vague circle to my eyes at the distance, and I lost my mind and started to run in the opposite direction, but Illy whipped three tentacles around me, gentle-like, and squeaked, \"Easy now, Gretta girl, don\u0027t you be doing it, too. Hold still or Papa spank. My, my, but you two-leggers can whirl about when you have a mind to.\"\\n\\n My stampede had carried his featherweight body a couple of yards, but it stopped me and I got my mind back, partly.\\n\\n \"Unhand it, I say!\" Sid repeated without accomplishing anything, and he released Beau, though he kept a hand near the gambler\u0027s shoulder.\\n\\n Then my fat friend from Lynn Regis looked real distraught at the Void and blustered at no one in particular, \"\u0027Sdeath, think you I\u0027d mutiny against my masters, desert the Spiders, go to ground like a spent fox and pull my hole in after me? A plague of such cowardice! Who suggests it? Introversion\u0027s no mere last-ditch device. Unless ordered, supervised and sanctioned, it means the end. And what if I\u0027d Introverted \u0027ere we got Kaby\u0027s call for succor, hey?\"\\n\\n His warrior maid nodded with harsh approval and he noticed it and shook his free hand at her and scolded her, \"Not that I say yea to your mad plan for that Devil\u0027s casket, you half-clad clack-wit. And yet to jettison ... Oh, ye gods, ye gods - \" he wiped his hand across his face - \"grant me a minute in which I may think!\"\\n\\n Thinking time wasn\u0027t an item even on the strictly limited list at the moment, although Sevensee, squatting dourly on his hairy haunches where Maud had left him threw in a dead-pan \"Thas teilin em, Gov.\"\\n\\n Then Doc at the bar stood up tall as Abe Lincoln in his top hat and shawl and 19th Century duds and raised an unwavering arm for silence and said something that sounded like: \"Introversh, inversh, glovsh,\" and then his enunciation switched to better than perfect as he continued, \"I know to an absolute certainty what we must do.\"\\n\\n It showed me how rabbity we were that the Place got quiet as a church while we all stopped whatever we were doing and waited breathless for a poor drunk to tell us how to save ourselves.\\n\\n He said something like, \"Inversh ... bosh ...\" and held our eyes for a moment longer. Then the light went out of his and he slobbered out a \"Nichevo\" and slid an arm far along the bar for a bottle and started to pour it down his throat without stopping sliding.\\n\\n Before he completed his collapse to the floor, in the split second while our attention was still focused on the bar, Bruce vaulted up on top of it, so fast it was almost like he\u0027d popped up from nowhere, though I\u0027d seen him start from behind the piano.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve a question. Has anyone here triggered that bomb?\" he said in a voice that was very clear and just loud enough. \"So it can\u0027t go off,\" he went on after just the right pause, his easy grin and brisk manner putting more heart into me all the time. \"What\u0027s more, if it were to be triggered, we\u0027d still have half an hour. I believe you said it had that long a fuse?\"\\n\\n He stabbed a finger at Kaby. She nodded.\\n\\n \"Right,\" he said. \"It\u0027d have to be that long for whoever plants it in the Parthian camp to get away. There\u0027s another safety margin.\\n\\n \"Second question. Is there a locksmith in the house?\"\\n\\n For all Bruce\u0027s easiness, he was watching us like a golden eagle and he caught Beau\u0027s and Maud\u0027s affirmatives before they had a chance to explain or hedge them and said, \"That\u0027s very good. Under certain circumstances, you two\u0027d be the ones to go to work on the chest. But before we consider that, there\u0027s Question Three: Is anyone here an atomics technician?\"\\n\\n That one took a little conversation to straighten out, Illy having to explain that, yes, the Early Lunans had atomic power - hadn\u0027t they blasted the life off their planet with it and made all those ghastly craters? - but no, he wasn\u0027t a technician exactly, he was a \"thinger\" (I thought at first his squeakbox was lisping); what was a thinger? - well, a thinger was someone who manipulated things in a way that was truly impossible to describe, but no, you couldn\u0027t possibly thing atomics; the idea was quite ridiculous, so he couldn\u0027t be an atomics thinger; the term was worse than a contradiction, well, really! - while Sevensee, from his twothousand-millennia advantage of the Lunan, grunted to the effect that his culture didn\u0027t rightly use any kind qf power, but just sort of moved satyrs and stuff by wrastling spacetirne around, \"or think em roun ef we hafta. Can\u0027t think em in the Void, tho, wus luck. Hafta have - I dunno wut. Dun havvit anyhow.\"\\n\\n \"So we don\u0027t have an A-tech,\" Bruce summed up, \"which makes it worse than useless, downright dangerous, to tamper with the chest. We wouldn\u0027t know what to do if we did get inside safely. One more question.\" He directed it toward Sid. \"How long before we can jettison anything?\"\\n\\n Sid, looking a shade jealous, yet mostly grateful for the way Bruce had calmed his chickens, started to explain, but Bruce didn\u0027t seem to be taking any chance of losing his audience, and as soon as Sid got to the word \"rhythm,\" he pulled the answer away from him.\\n\\n \"In brief, not until we can effectively tune in on the cosmos again. Thank you, Master Lessingham. That\u0027s at least five hours - two mealtimes, as the Cretan officer put it,\" and he threw Kaby a quick soldierly smile. \"So, whether the bomb goes to Egypt or elsewhere, there\u0027s not a thing we can do about it for five hours. All right then!\"\\n\\n His smile blinked out like a light and he took a couple of steps up and down the bar, as if measuring the space he had. Two or three cocktail glasses sailed off and popped, but he didn\u0027t seem to notice them and we hardly did either. It was creepy the way he kept staring from one to another of us. We had to look up. Behind his face, with the straight golden hair flirting around it, was only the Void.\\n\\n \"All right then,\" he repeated suddenly. \"We\u0027re twelve Spiders and two Ghosts, and we\u0027ve time for a bit of a talk, and we\u0027re all in the same bloody boat, fighting the same bloody war, so we\u0027ll all. know what we\u0027re talking about. I raised the subject a while back, but I was steamed up about a glove, and it was a big jest. All right! But now the gloves are off!\"\\n\\n Bruce ripped them out of his belt where they\u0027d been tucked and slammed them down on the bar, to be kicked off the next time he paced back and forth, and it wasn\u0027t funny.\\n\\n \"Because,\" he went right on, \"I\u0027ve been getting a completely new picture of what this Spiders\u0027 war has been doing to each one of us. Oh, it\u0027s jolly good sport to slam around in space and time and then have a rugged little party outside both of them when the operation\u0027s over. It\u0027s sweet to know there\u0027s no cranny of reality so narrow, no privacy so intimate or sacred, no wall of was or will be strong enough, that we can\u0027t shoulder in. Knowledge is a glamorous thing, sweeter than lust or gluttony or the passion of fighting and including all three, the ultimate insatiable hunger, and it\u0027s great to be Faust, even in a pack of other Fausts.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s sweet to jigger reality, to twist the whole course of a man\u0027s life or a culture\u0027s, to ink out his or its past and scribble in a new one, and be the only one to know and gloat over the changes - hah! killing men or carrying off women isn\u0027t in it for glutting the sense of power. It\u0027s sweet to feel the Change Winds blowing through you and know the pasts that were and the past that is and the pasts that may be. It\u0027s sweet to wield the Atropos and cut a Zombie or Unborn out of his lifeline and look the Doubleganger in the face and see the Resurrection-glow in it and Recruit a brother, welcome a newborn fellow Demon into our ranks and decide whether he\u0027ll best fit as Soldier, Entertainer, or what.\\n\\n \"Or he can\u0027t stand Resurrection, it fries or freezes him, and you\u0027ve got to decide whether to return him to his lifeline and his Zombie dreams, only they\u0027ll be a little grayer and horrider than they were before, or whether, if she\u0027s got that tantalizing something, to bring her shell along for a Ghostgirl - that\u0027s sweet, too. It\u0027s even sweet to have Change Death poised over your neck, to know that the past isn\u0027t the precious indestructible thing you\u0027ve been taught it was, to know that there\u0027s no certainty about the future either, whether there\u0027ll even be one, to know that no part of reality is holy, that the cosmos itself may wink out like a flicked switch and God be not and nothing left but nothing.\"\\n\\n He threw out his arms against the Void. \"And knowing all that, it\u0027s doubly sweet to come through the Door into the Place and be out of the worst of the Change Winds and enjoy a well-earned Recuperation and share the memories of all these sweetnesses I\u0027ve been talking about, and work out all the fascinating feelings you\u0027ve been accumulating back in the cosmos, layer by black layer, in the company of and with the help of the best bloody little band of fellow Fausts and Faustines going!\\n\\n \"Oh, it\u0027s a sweet life, all right, but I\u0027m asking you - \" and here his eyes stabbed us again, one by one, fast - \"I\u0027m asking you what it\u0027s done to us. I\u0027ve been getting a completely new picture, as I said, of what my life was and what it could have been if there\u0027d been changes of the sort that even we Demons can\u0027t make, and what my life is. I\u0027ve been watching how we\u0027ve all been responding to things just now, to the news of Saint Petersburg and to what the Cretan officer told beautifully - only it wasn\u0027t beautiful what she had to tell - and mostly to that bloody box of bomb. And I\u0027m simply asking each one of you, what\u0027s happened to you?\"\\n\\n He stopped his pacing and stuck his thumbs in his belt and seemed to be listening to the wheels turning in at least eleven other heads - only I stopped mine pretty quick, with Dave and Father and the Rape of Chicago coming up out of the dark on the turn and Mother and the Indiana Dunes and Jazz Limited just behind them, followed by the unthinkable thing the Spider doctor had flicked into existence when I flopped as a nurse, because I can\u0027t stand that to be done to my mind by anybody but myself.\\n\\n I stopped them by using the old infallible Entertainers\u0027 gimmick, a fast survey of the most interesting topic there is - other people\u0027s troubles.\\n\\n Offhand, Beau looked as if he had most troubles, shamed by his boss and his girl given her heart to a Soldier; he was hugging them to himself very quiet.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t stop for the two ETs - they\u0027re too hard to figure - or for Doc; nobody can tell whether a fallen-down drunk\u0027s at the black or bright end of his cycle; you just know it\u0027s cycling.\\n\\n Maud ought to be suffering as much as Beau, called names and caught out in a panic, which always hurts her because she\u0027s plus three hundred years more future than the rest of us and figures she ought to be that much wiser, which she isn\u0027t always - not to mention she\u0027s over fifty years old, though her home-century cosmetic science keeps her looking and acting teen-age most of the time. She\u0027d backed away from the bronze chest so as not to stand out, and now Lili came from behind the piano and stood beside her.\\n\\n Lili had the opposite of troubles, a great big glow for Bruce, proud as a promised princess watching her betrothed. Erich frowned when he saw her, for he seemed proud too, proud of the way his Kamerad had taken command of us panicky whacks Fuhrer-fashion. Sid still looked mostly grateful and inclined to let Bruce keep on talking.\\n\\n Even Kaby and Mark, those two dragons hot for battle, standing a little in front and to one side of us by the bronze chest, like its guardians, seemed willing to listen. They made me realize one reason Sid had for letting Bruce run on, although the path his talk was leading us down was flashing with danger signals: When it was over, there\u0027d still be the problem of what to do with the bomb, and a real opposition shaping up between Soldiers and Entertainers, and Sid was hoping a solution would turn up in the meantime or at least was willing to put off the evil day.\\n\\n But beyond all that, and like the rest of us, I could tell from the way Sid was squinting his browy eyes and chewing his beardy lip that he was shaken and moved by what Bruce had said. This New Boy had dipped into our hearts and counted our kicks so beautifully, better than most of us could have done, and then somehow turned them around so that we had to think of what messes and heels and black sheep and lost lambs we were - well, we wanted to keep on listening. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-big-time/page-7.html","bookId":1610,"book":{"id":1610,"title":"The Big Time","description":"Storyline: Have you ever worried about your memory, because it doesn\u0027t seem to recall exactly the same past from one day to the next?
