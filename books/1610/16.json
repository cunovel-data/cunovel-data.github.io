{"id":93211,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"\"Familiar with infinite universe sheafs and open-ended postulate systems? - the notion that everything is possible - and I mean everything - and everything has happened. Everything.\" - Heinlein THE POSSIBILITY-BINDERS An hour later, I was nursing a weak highball and a black eye in the sleepy-time darkness on the couch farthest from the piano, half watching the highlighted party going on around it and the bar, while the Place waited for rendezvous with Egypt and the Battle of Alexandria. Sid had swept all our outstanding problems into one big bundle and, since his hand held the joker high-handedly as if they\u0027d been those of a bunch of the Minor Maintainer, he had settled them all as schoolkids. It amounted to this: We\u0027d been Introverted when most of the damning things had happened, so presumably only we knew about them, and we were all in so deep one way or another that we\u0027d all have to keep quiet to protect our delicate complexions. Well, Erich\u0027s triggering the bomb did balance rather neatly Bruce\u0027s incitement to mutiny, and there was Doc\u0027s drinking, while everybody who had declared for the peace message had something to hide. Mark and Kaby I felt inclined to trust anywhere, Maud for sure, and Erich in this particular matter, damn him. Illy I didn\u0027t feel at all easy about, but I told myself there always has to be a fly in the ointment - a darn big one this time, and furry. Sid didn\u0027t mention his own dirty linen, but he knew we knew he\u0027d flopped badly as boss of the Place and only recouped himself by that last-minute flimflam. Remembering Sid\u0027s trick made me think for a moment about the real Spiders. Just before I snuck out of Surgery, I\u0027d had a vivid picture of what they must look like, but now I couldn\u0027t get it again. It depressed me, not being able to remember - oh, I probably just imagined I\u0027d had a picture, like a hophead on a secret-of-the universe kick. Me ever find out anything about the Spiders? - except for nervous notions like I\u0027d had during the recent fracas? - what a laugh! The funniest thing (ha-ha!) was that I had ended up the least-trusted person. Sid wouldn\u0027t give me time to explain how I\u0027d deduced what had happened to the Maintainer, and even when Lili spoke up and admitted hiding it, she acted so bored I don\u0027t think everybody believed her - although she cUd spill the realistic detail that she hadn\u0027t used partial inversion on the glove; she\u0027d just turned it inside out to make it a right and then done a full Inversion to get the lining back inside. I tried to get Doc to confirm that he\u0027d reasoned the thing out the same way I had, but he said he had been blacked out the whole time, except during the first part of the hunt, and he didn\u0027t remember having Maud explain to him twice, in detail, everything that had happened. I decided that it was going to take a little more work before my reputation as a great detective was established. I looked over the edge of the couch and just made out in the gloom one of Bruce\u0027s black gloves. It must have been kicked there. I fished it up. It was the right-hand one. My big clue, and was I sick of it! Got mittens, God forbid! I slung it away and, like a lurking octopus, Illy shot up a tentacle from the next couch, where I hadn\u0027t known he was resting, and snatched the glove like it was a morsel of underwater garbage. These ETs can seem pretty shuddery non-human at times. I thought of what a cold-blooded, skin-saving louse Illy had been, and about Sid and his easy suspicions, and Erich and my black eye, and how, as usual, I\u0027d got left alone in the end. My men! Bruce had explained about being an A-tech. Like a lot of us, he\u0027d had several widely different jobs during his first weeks in the Change World and one of them had been as secretary to a group of the minor atomics boys from the Manhattan-ProjectEarth-Satellite days. I gathered he\u0027d also absorbed some of his bothersome ideas from them. I hadn\u0027t quite decided yet what species of heroic heel he belonged to, but he was thick with Mark and Erich again. Everybody\u0027s men! Sid didn\u0027t have to argue with anybody; all the wild compulsions and mighty resolves were dead now, anyway until they\u0027d had a good long rest. I sure could use one myself, I knew. The party at the piano was getting wilder. Lili had been dancing the black bottom on top of it and now she jumped down into Sid\u0027s and Sevensee\u0027s arms, taking a long time about it. She\u0027d been drinking a lot and her little gray dress looked about as innocent on her as diapers would on Nell Gwyn. She continued her dance, distributing her marks of favor equally between Sid, Erich and the satyr. Beau didn\u0027t mind a bit, but serenely pounded out \"Tonight\u0027s the Night\" - which she\u0027d practically shouted\u0027 to him not two minutes ago. I was glad to be out of the party. Who can compete with a highly experienced, utterly disillusioned seventeen-year-old really throwing herself away for the first time? Something touched my hand. Illy had stretched a tentacle into a furry wire to return me the black glove, although he ought to have known I didn\u0027t want it. I pushed it away, privately calling Illy a washed-out moronic tarantula, and right away I felt a little guilty. What right had I to be critical of Illy? Would my own character have shown to advantage if I\u0027d been locked in with eleven octopoids billion years away? For that matter, where did I get off being critical of anyone? Still, I was glad to be out of the party, though I kept on watching it. Bruce was drinking alone at the bar. Once Sid had gone over to him and they\u0027d had one together and I\u0027d heard Bruce reciting from Rupert Brooke those deliberately corny lines, \"For England\u0027s the one land, I know, Where men with Splendid Hearts may go; and Cambridgeshire, of all England, The Shire for Men who Understand;\" and I\u0027d remembered that Brooke too had died young in World War One and my ideas had got fuzzy. But mostly Bruce was just calmly drinking by himself. Every once in a while Lili would look at him and stop dead in her dancing and laugh. I\u0027d figured out this Bruce-Lili-Erich business as well as I cared to. Lili had wanted the nest with all her heart and nothing else would ever satisfy her, and now she\u0027d go to hell her own way and probably die of Bright\u0027s disease for a third time in the Change World. Bruce hadn\u0027t wanted the nest or Lili as much as he wanted the Change World and the chances it gave for Soldierly cavorting and poetic drunks; Lili\u0027s seed wasn\u0027t his idea of healing the cosmos; maybe he\u0027d make a real mutiny some day, but more likely he\u0027d stick to barroom epics. His and Lili\u0027s infatuation wouldn\u0027t die completely, no matter how rancid it looked right now. The real-love angle might go, but Change would magnify the romance angle and it might seem to them like a big thing of a sort if they met again. Erich had his Kamerad, shaped to suit him, who\u0027d had the guts and cleverness to disarm the bomb he\u0027d had the guts to trigger. You have to hand it to Erich for having the nerve to put us all in a situation where we\u0027d have to find the Maintainer or fry, but I don\u0027t know anything disgusting enough to hand to him. I had tried a while back. I had gone up behind him and said, \"Hey, how\u0027s my wicked little commandant? Forgotten your und so weiter?\" and as he turned, I clawed my nails and slammed him across the cheek. That\u0027s how I got the black eye. Maud wanted to put an electronic leech on it, but I took the old handkerchief in ice water. Well, at any rate Erich had his scratches to match Bruce\u0027s not as deep, but four of them, and I told myself maybe they\u0027d get infected - I hadn\u0027t washed my hands since the hunt. Not that Erich doesn\u0027t love scars. Mark was the one who helped me up after Erich knocked me down. \"You got any omnias for that?\" I snapped at him. \"For what?\" Mark asked. \"Oh, for everything that\u0027s been happening to us,\" I told him disgustedly. He seemed to actually think for a moment and then he said, \"Omnia mutantur, nihil interit.\" \"Meaning?\" I asked him. He said, \"All things change, but nothing is really lost.\" It would be a wonderful philosophy to stand with against the Change Winds. Also damn silly. I wondered if Mark really believed it. I wished I could. Sometimes I come close to thinking it\u0027s a lot of baloney trying to be any decent kind of Demon, even a good Entertainer. Then I tell myself, \"That\u0027s life, Greta. You\u0027ve got to love through it somehow.\" But there are times when some of these cookies are not too easy to love. Something brushed the palm of my hand again. It was Illy\u0027s tentacle, with the tendrils of the tip spread out like a little bush. I started to pull my hand away, but then I realized the Loon was simply lonely. I surrendered my hand to the patterned gossamer pressures of feather-talk. Right away I got the words, \"Feeling lonely, Greta girl?\" It almost floored me, I tell you. Here I was understanding feather-talk, which I just didn\u0027t, and I was understanding it in English, which didn\u0027t make sense at all. For a second, I thought Illy must have spoken, but I knew he hadn\u0027t and for a couple more seconds I thought he was working telepathy on me, using the feather-talk as cues. Then I tumbled to what was happening: he was playing English on my palm like on the keyboard of his squeakbox, and since I could play English on a squeakbox myself, my mind translated automatically. Realizing this almost gave my mind stage fright, but I was too fagged to be hocused by selfconsciausness. I just lay back and let the thoughts come through. It\u0027s good to have someone talk to you, even an underweight octopus, and without the squeaks Illy didn\u0027t sound so silly; his phrasing was soberer. \"Feeling sad, Greta girl, because you\u0027ll never understand what\u0027s happening to us all,\" Illy asked me, \"because you\u0027ll never be anything but a shadow fighting shadows - and trying to love shadows In between the battles? It\u0027s time you understood we\u0027re not really fighting a war at all, although it looks that way, but going through a kind of evolution, though not exactly the kind Erich had in mind. \"Your Terran thought has a word for it and a theory for it - a theory that recurs on many worlds. It\u0027s about the four orders of life: Plants, Animals, Men and Demons. Plants are energy-binders - they can\u0027t move through space or time, but they can clutch energy and transform it. Animals are spacebinders - they can move through space. Man (Terran or ET, Lunan or non-Lunan) is a timebinder - he has memory. \"Demons are the fourth order of evolution, possibility-binders - they can make all of what might be part of what is, and that is their evolutionary function. Resurrection is like the metamorphosis of a caterpillar into a butterfly: a third-order being breaks out of the chrysalis of its lifeline into fourthorder life. The leap from the ripped cocoon of an unchanging reality is like the first animal\u0027s leap when he ceases to be a plant, and the Change World is the core of meaning behind the many myths of immortality. \"All evolution looks like a war at first - octopoids against monopoids, mammals against reptiles. And it has a necessary dialectic: there must be the thesis - we call it Snake - and the antithesis - Spider - before there can be the ultimate synthesis, when all possibilities are fully realized in one ultimate universe. The Change War isn\u0027t the blind destruction it seems. \"Remember that the Serpent is your symbol of wisdom and the Spider your sign of patience. The two names are rightly frightening to you, for all high existence is a mixture of horror and delight. And don\u0027t be surprised, Greta girl, at the range of my words and thoughts; in a way, I\u0027ve had a billion years to study Terra and learn her languages and myths. \"Who are the real Spiders and Snakes, meaning who were the first possibility-binders? Who was Adam, Greta girl? Who was Cain? Who were Eve and Lilith? \"In binding all possibility, the Demons also bind the mental with the material. All fourth-order beings live inside and outside all minds, throughout the whole cosmos. Even this Place is, after its fashion, a giant brain: its floor is the brainpan, the boundary of the Void is the cortex of gray matter - yes, even the Major and Minor Maintainers are analogues of the pineal and pituitary glands, which in some form sustain all nervous systems. \"There\u0027s the real picture, Greta girl.\" The feather-talk faded out and Illy\u0027s tendril tips merged into a soft pad on which I fingered, \"Thanks, Daddy Long-legs.\" Chewing over in my mind what Illy had just told me, I looked back at the gang around the piano. The party seemed to be breaking up; at least some of them were chopping away at it. Sid had gone to the control divan and was getting set to tune in Egypt. Mark and Kaby were there with him, all bursting with eagerness and the vision of ranks on ranks of mounted Zombie bowmen going up in a mushroom cloud; I thought of what Illy had told me and I managed a smile - seems we\u0027ve got to win and lose all the battles, every which way. Mark had just put on his Parthian costume, groaning cheerfully, \"Trousers again!\" and was striding around under a hat like a fur-lined ice-cream cone and with the sleeves of his metal-stuffed candys flapping over his hands. He waves a short sword with a heart-shaped guard at Bruce and Erich and told them to get a move on. Kaby was going along on the operation wearing the old-woman disguise intended for Benson-Carter. I got a half-hearted kick out of knowing she was going to have to cover that chest and hobble. Bruce and Erich weren\u0027t taking orders from Mark just yet. Erich went over and said something to Bruce at the bar, and Bruce got down and went over with Erich to the piano, and Erich tapped Beau on the shoulder and leaned over and said something to him, and Beau nodded and yanked \"Limehouse Blues\" to a fast close and started another piece, something slow and nostalgic. Erich and Bruce waved to Mark and smiled, as if to show him that whether he came over and stood with them or not, the legate and the lieutenant and the commandant were very much together. And while Sevensee hugged Lili with a simple enthusiasm that made me wonder why I\u0027ve wasted so much imagination on genetic treatments for him, Erich and Bruce sang: \"To the legion of the lost ones, to the cohort of the damned, To our brothers in the tunnels outside time, Sing three Change-resistant Zombies, raised from death and robot-crammed, And Commandos of the Spiders - Here\u0027s to crime! We\u0027re three blind mice on the wrong time-track, Hush - hush - hush! We\u0027ve lost our now and will never get back, Hush - hush - hush! Change Commandos out on the spree, Damned through all possibility, Ghostgirls, think kindly on such as we, Hush - hush - hush!\" While they were singing, I looked down at my charcoal skirt and over at Maud and Lili and I thought, \"Three gray hustlers for three black hussars, that\u0027s our speed.\" Well, I\u0027d never thought of myself as a high-speed job, winning all the races - I wouldn\u0027t feel comfortable that way. Come to think of it, we\u0027ve got to lose and win all the races in the long run, the way the course is laid out. I fingered to Illy, \"That\u0027s the picture, all right, Spider boy.\" THE END","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-big-time/page-16.html","bookId":1610,"book":{"id":1610,"title":"The Big Time","description":"Storyline: Have you ever worried about your memory, because it doesn\u0027t seem to recall exactly the same past from one day to the next?
