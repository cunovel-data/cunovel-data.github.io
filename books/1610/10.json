The others were finishing up. Erich, Mark and Kaby were having a quietly furious argument I couldn\u0027t overhear at the end of the bar nearest the bronze chest, and Illy was draped over the piano like a real octopus, listening in.\n Beau and Sevensee were pacing up and down near the control divan and throwing each other a word now and then. Beyond them, Bruce and Lili were sitting on the opposite couch from us, talking earnestly about something. Maud had sat down at the other end of the bar and was knitting - it\u0027s one of the habits like chess and quiet drinking, or learning to talk by squeak box, that we pick up to pass the time in the Place in the long stretches between parties. Doc was fiddling around the Gallery, picking things up and setting them down, still managing to stay on his feet at any rate.\n Lili and Bruce stood up, still gabbing intensely at each other, and Illy began to pick out with one tentacle a little tune in the high keys that didn\u0027t sound like anything on God\u0027s earth. \"Where do they get all the energy?\" I wondered.\n As soon as I asked myself that, I knew the answer and I began to feel the same way myself. It wasn\u0027t energy; it was nerves, pure and simple.\n Change is like a drug, I realized - you get used to the facts never staying the same, and one picture of the past and future dissolving into another maybe not very different but still different, and your mind being constantly goosed by strange moods and notions, like nightclub lights of shifting color with weird shadows between shining right on your brain.\n The endless swaying and jogging is restful, like riding on a train.\n You soon get to like the movement and to need it without knowing, and when it suddenly stops and you\u0027re just you and the facts you think from and feel from are exactly the same when you go back to them - boy, that\u0027s rough, as I found out now.\n The instant we got Introverted, everything that ordinarily leaks into the Place, wake or sleep, had stopped coming, and we were nothing but ourselves and what we meant to each other and what we could make of that, an awfully lonely, scratchy situation.\n I decided I felt like I\u0027d been drooped into a swimming pool full of cement and held under until it hardened.\n I could understand the others bouncing around a bit. It was a wonder they didn\u0027t hit the Void. Maud seemed to be standing it the best, maybe she\u0027d got a little preparation from the long watches between stars; and then she is older than all of us, even Sid, though with a small \"o\" in \"older.\"\n The restless work of the search for the Maintainer had masked the feeling, but now it was beginning to come full force. Before the search, Bruce\u0027s speech and Erich\u0027s interruptions had done a passable masking job too. I tried to remember when I\u0027d first got the feeling and decided it was after Erich had jumped on the bomb, about the time he mentioned poetry. Though I couldn\u0027t be sure. Maybe the Maintainer had been Introverted even earlier, when I\u0027d turned to look at the Ghostgirls. I wouldn\u0027t have known. Nuts!\n Believe me, I could feel that hardened cement on every inch of me. I remembered Bruce\u0027s beautiful picture of a universe without Big Change and decided it was about the worst idea going. I went on eating, though I wasn\u0027t so sure now it was a good idea to keep myself strong.\n \"Does the Maintainer have an Introversion telltale? Siddy!\"\n \"Sdeath, chit, and you love me, speak lower. Of a sudden, I feel not well, as if I\u0027d drunk a butt of Rhenish and slept inside it. Marry yes, blue. In short flashes, saith the manual. Why ask\u0027st thou?\"\n \"No reason. God, Siddy, what I\u0027d give for a breath of Change Wind.\"\n \"Thou can\u0027st say that eftsoons,\" he groaned. I must have looked pretty miserable myself, for he put his arm around my shoulders and whispered gruffly, \"Comfort thyself sweetling, that while we suffer thus sorely, we yet cannot die the Change Death.\"\n \"What\u0027s that?\" I asked him.\n I didn\u0027t want to bounce around like the others. I had a suspicion I\u0027d carry it too far. So, to keep myself from going batty, I started to rework the business of who had done what to the Maintainer.\n During the hunt, there had been some pretty wild suggestions tossed around as to its disappearance or at least its Introversion: a feat of Snake science amounting to sorcery; the Spider high command bunkering the Places from above, perhaps in reaction to the loss of the Express Room, in such a hurry that they hadn\u0027t even time to transmit warnings; the hand of the Late Cosmicians, those mysterious hypothetical beings who are supposed to have successfully resisted the extension of the Change War into the future much beyond Sevensee\u0027s epoch - unless the Late Cosmicians are the ones fighting the Change War.\n One thing these suggestions had steered very clear of was naming any one of us as a suspect, whether acting as Snake spy, Spider political police, agent of - who knows, after Bruce? - a secret Change World Committee of Public Safety or Spider revolutionary underground, or strictly on our own. Just as no one had piped a word, since the Maintainer had been palmed, about the split between Erich\u0027s and Bruce\u0027s factions.\n Good group thinking probably, to sink differences in the emergency, but that didn\u0027t apply to what I did with my own thoughts.\n Who wanted to escape so bad they\u0027d Introvert the Place, cutting off all possible contact and communication either way with the cosmos and running the very big risk of not getting back to the cosmos at all?\n Leaving out what had happened since Bruce had arrived and stirred things up, Doc seemed to me to have the strongest motive. He knew that Sid couldn\u0027t keep covering up for him forever and that Spider punishments for derelictions of duty are not just the clink of a firing squad, as Erich had reminded us. But Doc had been flat on the floor in front of the bar from the time Bruce had jumped on top of it, though I certainly hadn\u0027t had my eye on him every second.\n Beau? Beau had said he was bored with the Place at a time when what he said counted, so he\u0027d hardly lock himself in it maybe forever, not to mention locking Bruce in with himself and the babe he had a yen for.\n Sid loves reality, Changing or not, and every least thing in it, people especially, more than any man or woman I\u0027ve ever known - he\u0027s like a big-eyed baby who wants to grab every object and put it in his mouth - and it was hard to imagine him ever cutting himself off from the cosmos.\n Maud, Kaby, Mark and the two ETs? None of them had any motive I knew of, though Sevensee\u0027s being from the very far future did tie in with that idea about the Late Cosmicians, and there did seem to be something developing between the Cretan and the Roman that could make them want to be Introverted together.\n \"Stick to the facts, Greta,\" I reminded myself with a private groan.\n That left Erich, Bruce, Lili and myself.\n Erich, I though - now we\u0027re getting somewhere. The little commandant has the nervous system of a coyote and the courage of a crazy tomcat, and if he thought it would help him settle his battle with Bruce better to be locked in with him, he\u0027d do it in a second.\n But even before Erich had danced on the bomb, he\u0027d been heckling Bruce from the crowd. Still, there would have been time between heckles for him to step quietly back from us, Introvert the Maintainer and ... well, that was nine-tenths of the problem.\n If I was the guilty party, I was nuts and that was best explanation of all. Gr-r-r!\n Bruce\u0027s motives seemed so obvious, especially the mortal (or was it immortal?) danger he\u0027d put himself in by inciting mutiny, that it seemed a shame he\u0027d been in full view on the bar so long. Surely, if the Maintainer had been Introverted before he jumped on the bar, we\u0027d all have noticed the flashing blue telltale. For that matter, I\u0027d have noticed it when I looked back at the Ghostgirls - if it worked as Sid claimed, and he said he had never seen it in operation, just read in the manual - oh, \u0027sdeath!\n But Bruce didn\u0027t need opportunity, as I\u0027m sure all the males in the Place would have told me right off, because he had Lifi to pull the job for him and she had as much opportunity as any of the rest of us. Myself, I have large reservations to this woman-isputty-in-the-hands-of-the-man-she-loves-madly theory, but I had to admit there was something to be said for it in this case, and it had seemed quite natural to me when the rest of us had decided, by unspoken agreement, that neither Lili\u0027s nor Bruce\u0027s checks counted when we were hunting for the Maintainer.\n That took care of all of us and left only the mysterious stranger, intruding somehow through a Door (how\u0027d he get it without using our Maintainer?) or from an unimaginable hiding place or straight out of the Void itself. I know that last is impossible - nothing can step out of nothing - but if anything ever looked like it was specially built for something not at all nice to come looming out of, it\u0027s the Void - misty, foggily churning, slimy gray ...\n \"Wait a second,\" I told myself, \"and hang onto this, Greta. It should have smacked you in the face at the start.\"\n Whatever came out of the Void, or, more to the point, whoever slipped back from our crowd to the Maintainer, Bruce would have seen them. He was looking at the Maintainer past our heads the whole time, and whatever happened to it, he saw it.\n Erich wouldn\u0027t have, even after he was on the bomb, because he\u0027d been stagewise enough to face Bruce most of the time to build up his role as tribune of the people.\n But Bruce would have - unless he got so caught up in what he was saying ...\n No, kid, a Demon is always an actor, no matter how much he believes in what he\u0027s saying, and there never was an actor yet who wouldn\u0027t instantly notice a member of the audience starting to walk out on his big scene.\n So Bruce knew, which made him a better actor than I\u0027d have been willing to grant, since it didn\u0027t look as if anyone else had thought of what had just occurred to me, or they\u0027d have gone over and put it to him.\n Not me, though - I don\u0027t work that way. Besides, I didn\u0027t feel up to it - Nervy Anna enfold me, I felt like pure hell.\n \"Maybe,\" I told myself encouragingly, \"the Place is Hell,\" but added, \"Be your age, Greta - be a real rootless, ruleless, ruthless twenty-nine.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-big-time/page-10.html","bookId":1610,"book":{"id":1610,"title":"The Big Time","description":"Storyline: \n Have you ever worried about your memory, because it doesn\u0027t seem to recall exactly the same past from one day to the next?
