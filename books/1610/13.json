I didn\u0027t. Everything, everybody, every move that was made, every word that was spoken, was painfully real to me, like a hand twisting and squeezing things deep inside me, and I saw every last detail spotlighted and magnified like I had the seven skulls.\\n\\n Erich was standing beyond the bomb chest; little smiles were raffling his lips. I\u0027d never seen him look so sharp. Illy was beside him, but not on his side, you understand. Mark, Sevensee and Beau were around the chest to the nearer side. Beau had dropped to a knee and was scanning the chest minutely, terror-under-control making him bend his head a little closer than he needed to for clear vision, but with his hands locked together behind his back, I guess to restrain the impulse to push any and everything that looked like a disarming button.\\n\\n Doc was sprawled face down on the nearest couch, out like a light, I suppose.\\n\\n Us four girls were still by the control divan. With Kaby, that surprised me, because she didn\u0027t look scared or frozen, but almost as intensely alive as Erich.\\n\\n Sid had turned back, as I\u0027d said, and had one hand stretched out toward but not touching the Minor Maintainer, and a look on his beardy face as if he were calling down death and destruction on every boozy rogue who had ever gone up from King\u0027s Lynn to Cambridge and London, and I realized why: if he\u0027d thought of the Minor Maintainer a second sooner, he could have pinned Erich down with heavy gravity before he could touch the buttons.\\n\\n Bruce was resting one hand on the head of the control divan and was looking toward the group around the chest, toward Erich, I think, as if Erich had done something rather wonderful for him, though I can\u0027t imagine myself being tickled at being included in anybody\u0027s suicide surprise party. Bruce looked altogether too dreamy, Brahma blast him, for someone who must have the same steel-spiked thought in his head that I know darn well the rest of us had: that in twenty-nine minutes or so, the Place would be a sun in a bag.\\n\\n Erich was the first to get down to business, as I\u0027d have laid any odds he would be. He had the jump on us and he wasn\u0027t going to lose it.\\n\\n \"Well, when are you going to start getting Lili to tell us where she hid the Maintainer? It has to be her - she was too certain it was gone forever when she talked. And Bruce must have seen from the bar who took the Maintainer, and who would he cover up for but his girl?\"\\n\\n There he was plagiarizing my ideas, but I guess I was willing to sign them over to him in full if he got the right pail of water for that time-bomb.\\n\\n He glanced at his wrist \"According to my Caller, you have twenty-nine and a half minutes, including the time it will take to get a Door or contact headquarters. When are you going to get busy on the girl?\"\\n\\n Bruce laughed a little - deprecatingly, so help me - and started toward him. \"Look here, old man,\" he said, \"There\u0027s no need to trouble Lili, or to fuss with headquarters, even if you could. Really not at all. Not to mention that your sunnises are quite unfounded, old chap, and I\u0027m a bit surprised at your advancing them. But that\u0027s quite all right because, as it happens, I\u0027m an atomics technician and I even worked on that very bomb. To disarm it, you just have to fiddle a bit with some of the ankhs, those hoopy little crosses. Here, let me - \"\\n\\n Allah il allah, but it must have struck everybody as it did me as being just too incredible an assertion, too bloody British a barefaced bluff, for Erich didn\u0027t have to say a word; Mark and Sevensee grabbed Bruce by the arms, one on each side, as he stooped toward the bronze chest, and they weren\u0027t gentle about it. Then Erich spoke.\\n\\n \"Oh, no, Bruce. Very sporting of you to try to cover up for your girl friend, but we aren\u0027t going to let ourselves be blown to stripped atoms twentyeight minutes too soon while you monkey with the buttons, the very thing Benson-Carter warned against, and pray for a guesswork miracle. It\u0027s too thin, Bruce, when you come from 1917 and haven\u0027t been on the Big Time for a hundred sleeps and were calling for an A-tech yourself a few hours ago. Much too thin. Bruce, something is going to happen that I\u0027m afraid you won\u0027t like, but you\u0027re going to have to put up with it. That is, unless Miss Foster decides to be cooperative.\"\\n\\n \"I say, you fellows, let me go,\" Bruce demanded, struggling experimentally. \"I know it\u0027s a bit thick to swallow and I did give you the wrong impression calling for an A-tech, but I just wanted to capture your attention then; I didn\u0027t want to have to work on the bomb. Really, Erich, would they have ordered Benson-Carter to pick us up unless one of us were an A-tech? They\u0027d be sure to include one in the bally operation.\"\\n\\n \"When they\u0027re using patchwork tactics?\" Erich grinningly quoted back at him.\\n\\n Kaby spoke up beside me and said, \"BensonCarter was a magician of matter and he was going on the operation disguised as an old woman. We have the cloak and hood with the other garments,\" and I wondered how this cold fish of a she-officer could be the same girl who was giving Mark slurpy looks not ten minutes ago.\\n\\n \"Well?\" Erich asked, glancing at his Caller and then swinging his eyes around at us as if there must be some of the old Wehrmacht iron somewhere. We all found ourselves looking at Lili and she was looking so sharp herself, so ready to jump and so at bay, that it was all I needed, at any rate, to make Erich\u0027s theory about the Maintainer a rock-bottom certainty.\\n\\n Bruce must have realized the way our minds were working, for he started to struggle in earnest and at the same time called, \"For God\u0027s sake, don\u0027t do anything to Lili! Let me loose, you idiots! Everything\u0027s true I told you - I can save you from that bomb. Sevensee, you took my side against the Spiders; you\u0027ve nothing to lose. Sid, you\u0027re an Englishman. Beau, you\u0027re a gentleman and you love her, too - for God\u0027s sake, stop them!\"\\n\\n Beau glanced up over his shoulder at Bruce and the others surging around close to his ankles and he had on his poker face. Sid I could tell was once more going through the purgatory of decision. Beau reached his own decision first and I\u0027ll say it for him that he acted on it fast and intelligently. Right from his kneeling position and before he\u0027d even turned his head quite back, he jumped Erich.\\n\\n But other things in this cosmos besides Man can pick sides and act fast. Illy landed on Beau midway and whipped his tentacles around him tight and they went wobbling around like a drunken whiteand-silver barber pole. Beau got his hands each around a tentacle, and at the same time his face began to get purple, and I winced at what they were both going through.\\n\\n Maybe Sevensee had a hoof in Sid\u0027s purgatory, because Bruce shook loose from the satyr and tried to knock out Mark, but the Roman twisted his arm and kept him from getting in a good punch.\\n\\n Erich didn\u0027t make a move to mix into either fight, which is my little commandant all over. Using his fists on anybody but me is beneath him.\\n\\n Then Sid made his choice, but there was no way for me to tell what it was, for, as he reached for the Minor Maintainer, Kaby contemptuously snatched it away from his hands and gave him a knee in the belly that doubled me up in sympathy and sent him sprawling on his knees toward the fighters. On the return, Kaby gave Lili, who\u0027d started to grab too, an effortless backhand smash that set her down on the divan.\\n\\n Erich\u0027s face lit up like an electric sign and he kept his eyes fixed on Kaby.\\n\\n She crouched a little, carrying her weight on the balls of her feet and firmly cradling the Minor Maintainer in her left arm, like a basketball captain planning an offensive. Then she waved her free hand decisively to the right. I didn\u0027t get it, but Erich did and Mark too, for Erich jumped for the Refresher sector and Mark let go of Bruce and followed him, ducking around Sevensee\u0027s arms, who was coming back into the fight on which side I don\u0027t know. Illy unwhipped from Beau and copied Erich and Mark with one big spring.\\n\\n Then Kaby twisted a dial as far as it would go and Bruce, Beau, Sevensee and poor Siddy were slammed down and pinned to the floor by about eight gravities.\\n\\n It should have been lighter near us - I hoped it was, but you couldn\u0027t tell from watching Siddy; he went flat on his face, spread-eagled, one hand stretched toward me so close, I could have touched it (but not let go!), and his mouth was open against the floor and he was gasping through a corner of it and I could see his spine trying to sink through his belly. Bruce just managed to get his head and one shoulder up a bit, and they all made me think of a Dore illustration of the Inferno where the cream of the damned are frozen up to their necks in ice in the innermost circle of Hell.\\n\\n The gravity didn\u0027t catch me, although I could feel it in my left arm. I was mostly in the Refresher secor, but I dropped down flat too, partly out of a crazy compassion I have, but mostly because I didn\u0027t want to take a chance of having Kaby knock me down.\\n\\n Erich, Mark and Illy had got clear and they headed toward us. Maud picked the moment to make her play; she hadn\u0027t much choice of times, if she wanted to make one. The Old Girl was looking it for once, but I guess the thought of her miracle must have survived alongside the fear of sacked sun and must have meant a lot to her, for she launched out fast, all set to straight-arm Kaby into the heavy gravity and grab the Minor Maintainer with the other hand. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-big-time/page-13.html","bookId":1610,"book":{"id":1610,"title":"The Big Time","description":"Storyline: Have you ever worried about your memory, because it doesn\u0027t seem to recall exactly the same past from one day to the next?
