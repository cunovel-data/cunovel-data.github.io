{"id":93210,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"black legged spiders with red hearts of hell - marquis LORD SPIDER \"Jesus!\" I turned and Sid\u0027s face was sticking through the screen like a tinted has-relief hanging on a gray wall and I got the impression he had peered unexpectedly through a slit in an arras into Queen Elizabeth\u0027s bedroom. He didn\u0027t have any time to linger on the sen sation even if he\u0027d wanted to, for an elbow with copper band thrust through the screen and dug his ribs and Kaby marched Lili in by the neck. Erich Mark and Illy were right behind. They caught the blue flashes and stopped dead, staring at the longlost. Erich spared me one look which seemed to say so you did it, not that it matters. Then he stepped forward and picked it up and held it solidly to his left side in the double right-angle made by fingers, forearm and chest, and reached for the Introversion switch with a look on his face as if he were opening a fifth of whisky. The blue light died and Change Winds hit me like a stiff drink that had been a long, long time in coming, like a hot trumpet note out of nowhere. I felt the changing pasts blowing through me, and the uncertainties whistling past, and ice-stiff reality softening with all its duties and necessities, and the little memories shredding away and dancing off like autumn leaves, leaving maybe not even ghosts behind, and all the crazy moods like Mardi Gras pouring down an evening street, and something inside me had the nerve to say it didn\u0027t care whether Greta Forzane\u0027s death was riding in those Winds because they felt so good. I could tell it was hitting the other the same way. Even battered, tight-lipped Lili seemed to be saying, you\u0027re making me drink the stuff and I hate you for it, but I do love it. I guess we\u0027d all had the worry that even finding and Extroverting the Maintainer wouldn\u0027t put us back in touch with the cosmos and give us those Winds we hate and love. The thing that cut through to us as we stood there glowing was not the thought of the bomb, though that would have come in a few seconds more, but Sid\u0027s voice. He was still standing in the screen, except that now his face was out the other side and we could just see parts of his graydoubleted back, but, of course, his \"Jesu!\" came through the screen as if it weren\u0027t there. At first I couldn\u0027t figure out who he could be talking to, but I swear I never heard his voice so courtly obsequious before, so strong and yet so filled with awe and an undernote of, yes, sheer terror. \"Lord, I am filled from top to toe with confusion that you should so honor my poor Place,\" he said. \"Poor say I and mine, when I mean that I have ever husked it faithfully for you, not dreaming that you would ever condescend ... yet knowing that your eye was certes ever upon me ... though I am but as a poor pinch of dust adrift between the suns ... I base myself. Prithee, how may I serve thee, sir? I know not e\u0027en how most suitably to address thee, Lord ... King ... Emperor Spider!\" I felt like I was getting very small, but not a bit less visible, worse luck, and even with the Change Winds inside me to give me courage, I thought this was really too much, coming on top of everything else; it was simply unfair. At the same time, I realized it was to be expected that the big bosses would have been watching us with their unblinking beady black eyes ever since we had Introverted waiting to pounce if we should ever come out of it. I tried to picture what was on the other side of the screen and I didn\u0027t like the assignment. But in spite of being petrified, I had a hard time not giggling, like the zany at graduation exercises, at the way the other ones in Surgery were taking it. I mean the Soldiers. They each stiffened up like they had the old ramrod inside them, and their faces got that important look, and they glanced at each other and the floor without lowering their heads, as if they were measuring the distance between their feet and mentally chalking alternate sets of footprints to step into. The way Wrich and Kaby held the Major and Minor Maintainers became formal; the way they checked their Callers and nodded reassuringly was positively esoteric. Even my somehow managed to look as if he were on parade. Then from beyond the screen came what was, under the circumstances, the worst noise I\u0027ve ever heard, a seemingly wordless distant-sounding howling and wailing, with a note of menace that made me shake, although it also had a nasty familiarity about it I couldn\u0027t place. Sid\u0027s voice broke into it, loud, fast and frightened. \"Your pardon, Lord, I did not think ... certes, fie gravity ... I\u0027ll attend to it on the instant.\" He whipped a hand and half a head back through the screen, but without looking back and snapped his fingers, and before I could blink, Kaby had put the Minor Maintainer in his hand. Sid went completely out of sight then and the howling stopped, and I thought that if that was the way a Lord Spider expressed his annoyance at being subjected to incorrect gravity, I hoped the bosses wouldn\u0027t start any conversations with me. Erich pursed his lips and threw the other Soldiers a nod and the four of them marched through the screen as if they\u0027d drilled a lifetime for this moment. I had the wild idea that Erich might give me his arm, but he strode past me as if I were ... an Entertainer. I hesitated a moment then, but I had to see what was happening outside, even if I got eaten up for it. Besides, I had a bit of the thought that if these formalities went on much longer, even a Lord Spider was going to discover just how immune he was to confined atomic blast. I walked through the screen with Lili beside me. The Soldiers had stopped a few feet in front of it. I looked around ahead for whatever it was going to turn out to be, prepared to drop a curtsy or whatever else, bar nothing, that seemed expected of me. I had a hard time spotting the beast. Some of the others seemed to be having trouble too. I saw Doc weaving around foolishly by the control divan, and Bruce and Beau and Sevensee and Maud on their feet beyond it, and I wondered whether we were dealing with an invisible monster; ought to be easy enough for the bosses to turn a simple trick like invisibility. Then I looked sharply left where everyone else, even glassy-eyed Doc, was coming to look, into the Door sector, only there wasn\u0027t any monster there or even a Door, but just Siddy holding a Minor Maintainer and grinning like when he is threatening to tickle me, only more fiendishly. \"Not a move, masters,\" he cried his eyes dancing, \"or I\u0027ll pin the pack of you down, marry and amen I will. It is my firm purpose to see the Place blasted before I let this instrument out of my hands again.\" My first thought was, \"\u0027Sblood but Siddy is a real actor! I don\u0027t care if he didn\u0027t study under anyone later than Burbage, that just proves how Burbage is.\" Sid had convinced us not only that the real Spiders had arrived, but earlier that the gravity in the edge of Stores had been a lot heavier than it actually was. He completely fooled all those Soldiers, including my swelled-headed victorious little commandant, and I kind of filed away the timing of that business of reaching out the hand and snapping the fingers without looking, it was so good. \"Beauregard!\" Sid called. \"Get to the Major Maintainer and call headquarters. But don\u0027t come through Door, marry go by Refresher. I\u0027ll not trust a single Demon of you in this sector with me until much more has been shown and settled.\" \"Siddy, you\u0027re wonderful,\" I said, starting toward him. \"As soon as I got the Maintainer unsnarled and looked around and saw your sweet old face - \" \"Back, tricksy trull! Not the breadth of one scarlet toenail nearer me, you Queen of Sleights and High Priestess of Deception!\" he bellowed. \"You least of all do I trust. Why you hid the Maintainer, I know not \u0027faith, but later you\u0027ll discover the truth to me or I\u0027ll have your gizzard.\" I could see there was going to have to be a little explaining. Doc, touched off, I guess, by Sid waving his hand at me, threw back his head and let off one of those shuddery Siberian wolf-howls he does so blamed well. Sid waved toward him sharply and he shut up, beaming toothily, but at least I knew who was responsible for the Spider wail of displeasure that Sid had either called for or more likely got as a gift of the gods and used in his act. Beau came circling around fast and Erich shoved the Major Maintainer into his hands without making any fuss. The four Soldiers were looking pretty glum after losing their grand review. Beau dumped some junk off one of the Art Gallery\u0027s sturdy taborets and set the Major Maintainer on it carefully but fast, and quickly knelt in front of it and whipped on some earphones and started to tune. The way he did it snatched away from me my inward glory at my big Inversion brainwaves so fast, I might never have had it, and there was nothing in my mind again but the bronze bomb chest. I wondered if I should suggest Inverting the thing, but I said to myself, \"Uh-uh, Greta, you got no diploma to show them and there probably isn\u0027t time to try two things, anyway.\" Then Erich for once did something I wanted him to, though I didn\u0027t care for its effect on my nerves, by looking at his Caller and saying quietly, \"Nine minutes to go, if Place time and cosmic time are synching.\" Beau was steady as a rock and working adjustments so fine that I couldn\u0027t even see his fingers move. Then, at the other end of the Place, Bruce took a few steps toward us. Sevensee and Maud followed a bit behind him. I remembered Bruce was another of our nuts with a private program for blowing up the place. \"Sidney,\" he called, and then, when he\u0027d got Sid\u0027s attention, \"Remember, Sidney, you and I both came down to London from Peterhouse.\" I didn\u0027t get it. Then Bruce looked toward Erich with a devil-may-care challenge and toward Lili as if he were asking her forgiveness for something. I couldn\u0027t read her expression; the bruises were blue on her throat and her cheek was puffy. Then Bruce once more shot Erich that look of challenge and he spun and grabbed Sevensee by a wrist and stuck out a foot - even half-horses aren\u0027t too sharp about infighting, I guess, and the satyr had every right to feel at least as confused as I felt - and sent him stumbling into Maud, and the two of them tumbled to the floor in a jumble of hairy legs and pearl-gray frock. Bruce raced to the bomb chest. Most of us yelled, \"Stop him, Sid, pin him down,\" or something like that - I know I did because I was suddenly sure that he\u0027d been asking Lili\u0027s pardon for blowing the two of them up - and all the rest of us too, the love-blinded stinker. Sid had been watching him all the time and now he lifted his hand to the Minor Maintainer, but then he didn\u0027t touch any of the dials, just watched and waited, and I thought, \"Shaitan shave us! Does Siddy want in on death, too? Ain\u0027t he satisfied with all he knows about life?\" Bruce had knelt and was twisting some things on the front of the chest, and it was all as bright as if he were under a bank of Klieg lights, and I was telling myself I wouldn\u0027t know anything when the fireball fired, and not believing it, and Sevensee and Maud had got unscrambled and were starting for Bruce, and the rest of us were yelling at Sid, except that Erich was just looking at Bruce very happily, and Sid was still not doing anything, and it was unbearable except just then I felt the little arteries start to burst in my brain like a string of firecrackers and the old aorta pop, and for good measure, a couple of valves come unhinged in my ticker, and I was thinking, \"Well, now I know what it\u0027s like to die of heart failure and high blood pressure,\" and having a last quiet smile at having cheated the bomb, when Bruce jumped up and back from the chest. \"That does it!\" he announced cheerily. \"She\u0027s as safe as the Bank of England.\" Sevensee and Maud stopped themselves just short of knocking him down and I said to myself, \"Hey, let\u0027s get a move on! I thought heart attacks were fast.\" Before anyone else could speak, Beau did. He had turned around from the Major Maintainer and pulled aside one of the earphones. \"I got headquarters,\" he said crisply. \"They told me how to disarm the bomb - I merely said I thought we ought to know. What did you do, sir?\" he called to Bruce. \"There\u0027s a row of four ankhs just below the lock. The first to your left you give a quarter turn to the right, the second a quarter turn to the left, same for the fourth, and you don\u0027t touch the third.\" \"That is it, sir,\" Beau confirmed. The long silence was too much for me; I guess I must have the shortest span for unspoken relief going. I drew some nourishment out of my restored arteries into my brain cells and yelled, \"Siddy, I know I\u0027m a tricksy trulland the High Vixen of all Foxes, but what the Hell is Peterhouse?\" \"The oldest college at Cambridge,\" he told me rather coolly.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-big-time/page-15.html","bookId":1610,"book":{"id":1610,"title":"The Big Time","description":"Storyline: Have you ever worried about your memory, because it doesn\u0027t seem to recall exactly the same past from one day to the next?
