She stood up and sort of took a position. AB the talk quieted down fast, even Bruce\u0027s and Lili\u0027s. Kaby\u0027s face and voice weren\u0027t strained now, but they weren\u0027t relaxed either.\\n\\n \"Woe to Spider! Woe to Cretan! Heavy is the news I bring you. Bear it bravely, like strong women. When we got the gun unlimbered, I heard seaweed fry and crackle. We three leaped behind the rock wall, saw our gun grow white as sunlight in a heat-ray of the Serpents! Natch, we feared we were outnumbered and I called upon my Caller.\"\\n\\n I don\u0027t know how she does it, but she does - in English too. That is, when she figures she\u0027s got something important to report, and maybe she needs a little time to get ready.\\n\\n Beau claims that all the ancients fit their thoughts into measured lines as naturally as we pick a word that will do, but I\u0027m not sure how good the Vicksburg language department is. Though why I should wonder about things like that when I\u0027ve got Kaby spouting the stuff right in front of me, I don\u0027t know.\\n\\n \"But I didn\u0027t die there, kiddos. I still hoped to hurt the Greek ships, maybe with the Snake\u0027s own heat gun. So I quick tried to outflank them. My two comrades crawled beside me - they are males, but they have courage. Soon we spied the ambushsetters. They were Snakes and they were many, filthily disguised as Cretans.\"\\n\\n There was an indignant murmur at this, for our cutthroat Change War has its code, the Soldiers tell me. Being an Entertainer, I don\u0027t have to say what I think.\\n\\n \"They had seen us when we saw them,\" Kaby swept on, \"and they loosed a killing volley. Heatand knife-rays struck about us in a storm of wind and fire, and the Lunan lost a feeler, fighting for Crete\u0027s Triple Goddess. So we dodged behind a sand bill, steered our flight back toward the water. It was awful, what we saw there; Crete\u0027s brave ships all sunk or sinking, blue sky sullied by their death-smoke. Once again the Greeks had licked us! - aided by the filthy Serpents.\\n\\n \"Round our wrecks, their black ships scurried, like black beetles, filth their diet, yet this day they dine on heroes. On the quiet sun-lit beach there, I could feel a Change Gale blowing, working changes deep inside me, aches and pains that were a stranger\u0027s. Half my memories were doubled, half my lifeline crooked and twisted, three new moles upon my swordhand. Goddess, Goddess, Tripple Goddess - \"\\n\\n Her voice wavered and Sid reached out a hand, but she straightened her back.\\n\\n \"Triple Goddess, give me courage to tell everything that happened. We ran down into the water, hoping to escape by diving. We had hardly gotten under when the heat-rays hit above us, turning all the cool green surface to a roaring white inferno. But as I believe I told you, I was calling on my Caller, and a Door now opened to us, deep below the deadly steam-clouds. We dived in like frightened minnows and a lot of water with us.\"\\n\\n Off Chicago\u0027s Gold Coast, Dave once gave me a lesson in skindiving and, remembering it, I got a flash of Kaby\u0027s Door in the dark depths.\\n\\n \"For a moment all was chaos. Then the Door slammed shut behind us. We\u0027d been picked up in time\u0027s nick by - an Express Room of our Spiders! - sloshing two feet deep in water, much more cramped for space than this Place. It was manned by a magician, an old coot named Benson-Carter. He dispelled the water quickly and reported on his Caller. We\u0027d got dry, were feeling human, Illy here had shed his swimsuit, when we looked at the Maintainer. It was glowing, changing, melting! And when Benson-Carter touched it, he fell backward - death was in him. Then the Void began to darken, narrow, shrink and close around us, so I called upon my Caller - without wasting time, let me tell you!\\n\\n \"We can\u0027t say for sure what was it slowly squeezed that sweet Express Room, but we fear the dirty Snakes have found a way to find our Places and attack outside the cosmos! - found the Spiderweb that links us in the Void\u0027s gray less-than-nothing.\"\\n\\n No murmur this time. This reaction was genuine; we\u0027d been hit where we lived and I could see everybody was scared as sick as I was. Except maybe Bruce and Lili, who were still holding hands and beaming gently. I decided they were the kind that love makes brave, which it doesn\u0027t do to me. It just gives me two people to worry about.\\n\\n \"I can see you dig our feeling,\" Kaby continued. \"This thing scared the pants off of us. If we could have, we\u0027d have even Introverted the Maintainer, broken all the ties that bind us, chanced it incommunicado. But the little old Maintainer was a seething red-hot puddle filled with bubbles big as handballs. We sat tight and watched the Void close. I kept calling on my Caller.\"\\n\\n I squeezed my eyes shut, but that made it easier to see the three of them with the Void shutting down on them. (Was ours till behaving? Yes, Bibi Miriam.) Poetry or no poetry, it got me.\\n\\n \"Benson-Carter, lying dying, also thought the Snakes had done it. And he knew that death was in him, so he whispered me his mission, giving me precise instructions: how to press the seven death\u0027s hands, starting lockside counterclockwise, one, three, five, six, two, four, seven, then you have a half an hour; after you have pressed the seven, do not monkey with the buttons - get out fast and don\u0027t stop moving.\"\\n\\n I wasn\u0027t getting this part and I couldn\u0027t see that anyone else was, though Bruce was whispering to Lili. I remembered seeing skulls engraved on the bronze chest. I looked at Illy and he nodded a tentacle and spread two to say, I guessed, that yes, Benson-Carter had said something like that, but no, Illy didn\u0027t know much about it.\\n\\n \"All these things and more he whispered,\" Kaby went on, \"with the last gasps of his life-force, telling all his secret orders - for he\u0027d not been sent to get us, he was on a separate mission, when he heard my SOSs. Sid, it\u0027s you he was to contact, as the first leg of his mission, pick up from you three black hussars, death\u0027s-head Demons, daring Soldiers, then to wait until the Places next match rhythm with the cosmos - matter of two mealtimes, barely - and to tune in northern Egypt in the age of the last Caesar, in the year the Rome\u0027s swift downfall, there to start on operation in a battle near a city named for Thrace\u0027s Alexander, there to change the course of battle, blow sky-high the stinking Serpents, all their agents, all their Zombies!\\n\\n \"Goddess, pardon, now I savvy how you\u0027ve guided my least foot-step, when I thought you\u0027d gone and left me - for I flubbed your three-mole signal. We\u0027ve found Sid\u0027s Place, that\u0027s the first leg, and I see the three black hussars, and we\u0027ve brought with us the weapon and the Parthian disguises, salvaged from the doomed Express Room when your Door appeared in time\u0027s nick, and the Room around us closing spewed us through before it vanished with the corpse of Benson-Carter. Triple Goddess, draw the milk now from the womanhood I flaunt here and inject the blackest hatred! Vengeance now upon the Serpants, vengeance sweet in northern Egypt, for your island, Crete, Goddess! - and a victory for the Spiders! Goddess, Goddess, we can swing it!\"\\n\\n The roar that made me try to stop my ears with my shoulders didn\u0027t come from Kaby - she\u0027d spoken her piece - but from Sid. The dear boy was purple enough to make me want to remind him you can die of high blood pressure just as easy in the Change World.\\n\\n \"Dump me with ops! \u0027Sblood, I\u0027ll not endure it! from field hospitals next. Kabysia Labrys, thou art mad to suggest it. And what\u0027s this prattle of locks, clocks, and death\u0027s heads, buttons and monkeys? This brabble, this farrago, this hocus-pocus! And where\u0027s the weapon you prate of? In that whoreson bronze casket, I suppose.\"\\n\\n She nodded, looking blank and almost a little shy as poetic possession faded from her. Her answer came like its faltering last echo.\\n\\n \"It is nothing but a tiny tactical atomic bomb.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-big-time/page-6.html","bookId":1610,"book":{"id":1610,"title":"The Big Time","description":"Storyline: Have you ever worried about your memory, because it doesn\u0027t seem to recall exactly the same past from one day to the next?
