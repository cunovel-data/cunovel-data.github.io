Then, clumsily bowed\\n\\n With bombs and guns and shovels and battle gear,\\n\\n Men jostle and climb to meet the bristling fire.\\n\\n Lines of gray, muttering faces, masked with fear,\\n\\n They leave their trenches, going over the top,\\n\\n While time ticks blank and busy on their wrists\\n\\n - Sassoon\\n\\n THE WESTERN FRONT, 1917\\n\\n \"Please don\u0027t, Lili.\"\\n\\n \"I shall, my love.\"\\n\\n \"Sweetling, wake up! Hast the shakes?\"\\n\\n I opened my eyes a little and lied to Siddy with a smile locked my hands together tight and watched Bruce and Lili quarrel nobly near the control divan and wished I had a great love to blur my misery and provide me with a passable substitute for Change Winds.\\n\\n Lili won the argument, judging from the way she threw her head back and stepped away from Bruce\u0027s arms while giving him a proud, tender smile. He walked off a few steps; praise be, he didn\u0027t shrug his shoulders at us like an old husband, though his nerves were showing and he didn\u0027t seem to be standing Introversion well at all, as who of us were?\\n\\n Lili rested a hand on the head of the control divan and pressed her lips together and looked around at us, mostly with her eyes. She\u0027d wound a gray silk bandeau around her bangs. Her short gray silk dress without a waistline made her look, not so much like a flapper, though she looked like that all right, as like a little girl, except the neckline was scooped low enough to show she wasn\u0027t.\\n\\n Her gaze hesitated and then stopped at me and I got a sunk feeling of what was coming, because women are always picking on me for an audience. Besides, Sid and I were the centrist party of two in our fresh-out-of-the-shell Place politics.\\n\\n She took a deep breath and stuck out her chin and said in a voice that was even a little higher and Britisher than she usually uses, \"We girls have often cried, \u0027Shut the Door!\u0027 But now the Door is jolly well shut for keeps!\"\\n\\n I knew I\u0027d guessed right and I felt crawly with embarrassment, because I know about this love business of thinking you\u0027re the other person and dying to live their life - and grab their glory, though you don\u0027t know that - and carry their message for them, and how it can foul things up. Still, I couldn\u0027t help admitting what she said wasn\u0027t too bad a start - unpleasantly apt to be true, at any rate.\\n\\n \"My fiance believes we may yet be able to open the Door. I do not. He thinks it is a bit premature to discuss the peculiar pickle in which we all find ourselves. I do not.\"\\n\\n There was a rasp of laughter from the bar. The militarists were reacting. Erich stepped out, looking very happy. \"So now we have to listen to women making speeches,\" he called. \"What is this Place, anyhow? Sidney Lessingham\u0027s Saturday Evening Sewing Circle?\"\\n\\n Beau and Sevensee, who\u0027d stopped their pacing halfway between the bar and the control divan, turned toward Erich, and Sevensee looked a little burlier, a little more like half a horse, than satyrs in mythology book illustrations. He stamped - medium hard, I\u0027d say - and said, \"Ahh, go flya kite.\" I\u0027d found out he\u0027d learned English from a Demon who\u0027d been a longshoreman with syndicalist-anarchist sympathies. Erich shut up for a moment and stood there grinning, his hands on his hips.\\n\\n Lili nodded to the satyr and cleared her throat, looking scared. But she didn\u0027t speak; I could see she was thinking and feeling something, and her face got ugly and haggard, as if she were in a Change Wind that hadn\u0027t reached me yet, and her mouth went into a snarl to fight tears, but some spurted out, and when she did speak her voice was an octave lower and it wasn\u0027t just London talking but New York too.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know how Resurrection felt to you people, because I\u0027m new and I loathe asking questions, but to me it was pure torture and I wished only I\u0027d had the courage to tell Suzaku, \u0027I wish to remain a Zombie, if you don\u0027t mind. I\u0027d rather the nightmares.\u0027 But I accepted Resurrection because I\u0027ve been taught to be polite and because there is the Demon in me I don\u0027t understand that always wishes to live, and I found that I still felt like a Zombie, although I could flit about, and that I still had the nightmares, except they\u0027d grown a deal vivider.\\n\\n \"I was a young girl again, seventeen, and I suppose every woman wishes to be seventeen, but I wasn\u0027t seventeen inside my head - I was a woman who had died of Bright\u0027s disease in New York in 1929 and also, because a Big Change blew my lifeline into a new drift, a woman who had died of the same disease in Nazi-occupied London in 1955, but rather more slowly because, as you can fancy, the liquor was in far shorter supply. I had to live with both those sets of memories and the Change World didn\u0027t blot them out any more than I\u0027m told it does those of any Demon, and it didn\u0027t even push them into the background as I\u0027d hoped it would.\\n\\n \"When some Change Fellow would say to me, \u0027Hallo, beautiful, how about a smile?\u0027 or \u0027Thats a posh frock, kiddo,\u0027 I\u0027d be back at Bellevue looking down at my swollen figure and the light getting like spokes of ice, or in that dreadful gin-steeped Stepney bedroom with Phyllis coughing herself to death beside me, or at best, for a moment, a little girl in Glamorgan looking at the Roman road and wondering about the wonderful life that lay ahead.\"\\n\\n I looked at Erich, remembering he had a long nasty future back in the cosmos himself, and at any rate he wasn\u0027t smiling, and I thought maybe he\u0027s getting a little humility, knowing someone else has two of those futures, but I doubted it.\\n\\n \"Because, you see,\" Lili kept forcing it out, \"all my three lives I\u0027d been a girl who fell in love with a great young poet she\u0027d never met, the voice of the new youth and all youth, and she\u0027d told her first big lie to get in the Red Cross and across to France to be nearer him, and it was all danger and dark magics and a knight in armor, and she pictured how she\u0027d find him wounded but not seriously, with a little bandage around his head, and she\u0027d light a fag for him and smile lightly, never letting him guess what she felt, but only being her best self and watching to see if that made something happen to him...\\n\\n \"And then the Boche machine guns cut him down at Passchendaele and there couldn\u0027t ever have been bandages big enough and the girl stayed seventeen inside and messed about and tried to be wicked, though she wasn\u0027t very good at that, and to drink, and she had a bit more talent there, though drinking yourself to death is not near as easy as it sounds, even with a kidney weakness to help. But she turned the trick.\\n\\n \"Then a cock crows. She wakes with a tearing start from the gray dreams of death that fill her lifeline. It\u0027s cold daybreak. There\u0027s the smell of a French farm. She feels her ankles and they\u0027re not at all like huge rubber boots filled with water. They\u0027re not swollen the least bit. They\u0027re young legs.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s a little window and the tops of a row of trees that may be poplars when there is more light, and what there is shows cots like her own and heads under blankets, and hanging uniforms make large shadows and a girl is snoring. There\u0027s a very distant rumble and it moves the window a bit. Then she remembers they\u0027re Red Cross girls many, many kilometers from Passchendaele and that Bruce Marchant is going to die at dawn today.\\n\\n \"In a few more minutes, he\u0027s going over the top where there\u0027s a crop-headed machine-gunner in the sights and swinging the gun a bit. But she isn\u0027t going to die today. She\u0027s going to die in 1929 and 1955.\\n\\n \"And just as she\u0027s going mad, there\u0027s a creaking and out of the shadows tiptoes a Jap with a woman\u0027s hairdo and the whitest face and the blackest eyebrows. He\u0027s wearing a rose robe and a black sash which belts to his sides two samurai swords, but in his right hand he has a strange silver pistol. And he smiles at her as if they were brother and sister and lovers at the same time and he says, \u0027Voulez-vous vivre, mademoiselle?\u0027 and she stares and he bobs his head and says, \u0027Missy wish live, yes, no?\"\\n\\n Sid\u0027s paw closed quietly around my shaking hands. It always gets me to hear about anyone\u0027s Resurrection, and although mine was crazier, it also had the Krauts in it. I hoped she wouldn\u0027t go through the rest of the formula and she didn\u0027t.\\n\\n \"Five minutes later, he\u0027s gone down a stairs more like a ladder to wait below and she\u0027s dressing in a rush. Her clothes resist a little, as if they were lightly gummed to the hook and the stained wall, and she hates to touch them. It\u0027s getting lighter and her cot looks as if someone were still sleeping there, although it\u0027s empty, and she couldn\u0027t bring herself to put her hand on the place if her new life depended on it.\\n\\n \"She climbs down and her long skirt doesn\u0027t bother her because she knows how to swing it. Suzaku conducts her past a sentry who doesn\u0027t see them and a puffy-faced farmer in a smock coughing and spitting the night out of his throat. They cross the farmyard and it\u0027s filled with rose light and she sees the sun is up and she knows that Bruce Marchant has just bled to death.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s an empty open touring car chugging loudly, waiting for someone; it has huge muddy wheels with wooden spokes and a brass radiator that says \u0027Simplex.\u0027 But Suzaku leads her past it to a dunghill and bows apologetically and she steps through a Door.\"\\n\\n I heard Erich say to the others at the bar, \"How touching! Now shall I tell everyone about my operation?\" But he didn\u0027t get much of a laugh.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s how Lilian Foster came into the Change World with its steel-engraved nightmares and its deadly pace and deadlier lassitudes. I was more alive than I ever had been before, but it was the kind of life a corpse might get from unending electrical shocks and I couldn\u0027t summon any purpose or hope and Bruce Marchant seemed farther away than ever.\\n\\n \"Then, not six hours ago, a Soldier in a black uniform came through the Door and I thought, \u0027It can\u0027t be, but it does look like his photographs,\u0027 and then I thought I heard someone say the name Bruce, and then he shouted as if to all the world that he was Bruce Marchant, and I knew there was a Resurrection beyond Resurrection, a true resurrection. Oh, Bruce - \"\\n\\n She looked at him and he was crying and smiling and all the young beauty flooded back into her face, and I thought, \"It has to be Change Winds, but it can\u0027t be. Face it without slobbering, Greta - there\u0027s something that works bigger miracles than Change.\"\\n\\n And she went on, \"And then the Change Winds died when the Snakes vaporized the Maintainer or the Ghostgfrls Introverted it and all three of them vanished so swiftly and silently that even Bruce didn\u0027t notice - those are the best explanations I can summon and I fancy one of them is true. At all events, the Change Winds died and my past and even my futures became something I could bear lightly, because I have someone to bear them with me, and because at last I have a true future stretching out ahead of me, an unknown future which I shall create by living. Oh, don\u0027t you see that all of us have it now, this big opportunity?\"\\n\\n \"Hussa for Sidney\u0027s suffragettes and the W.C.T.U.!\" Erich cheered. \"Beau, will you play us a medley of \u0027Hearts and Flowers\u0027 and \u0027Onward Christian Soldiers\u0027? I\u0027m deeply moved, Lili. Where do the rest of us queue up for the Great Love Affair of the Century?\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-big-time/page-11.html","bookId":1610,"book":{"id":1610,"title":"The Big Time","description":"Storyline: Have you ever worried about your memory, because it doesn\u0027t seem to recall exactly the same past from one day to the next?
