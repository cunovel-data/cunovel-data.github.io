{"id":75250,"no":84,"title":"Page 84","content":"Bobbi was blissfully happy with Gabe, and he had kept his promise over the last year of marriage. It didn’t matter where they went, how formal the occasion, or how out of place her “badass fairy” dresses were, he always looked at her like she was the most beautiful woman in the room. She looked around at her friends, who were all laughing and squabbling happily, and her brothers—Billy and Chase—who were lightheartedly mediating a fight that had broken out amongst the small children on the sidelines, and felt remarkably blessed. This place, these people, and this moment right now—it was home. “How did we get so lucky?” she asked Gabe, who stood behind her and wrapped his arms around her front until his hands rested on her belly. He rested his chin on her shoulder as he watched their happy group of family and friends too. “I don’t know . . . but I know my luck started improving one night long ago, when a sexy, drunken fairy wiped me out with an unexpected kiss. It was the best damned thing that ever happened to me.” “I love you so much,” she said, craning her head to look back at him, and she just managed to see the corner of his lip kick up in a smile. “Can’t possibly be as much as I love you,” he teased. She turned within his hold and wrapped her arms around his neck. “Wanna bet?” she challenged. “You’ll lose,” he retorted. Before she could say another word he kissed her, and the caress was sweet, hot, loving, and perfect. “I think,” she whispered when he lifted his head, “that we’re both winners.” He smiled and released her briefly before taking hold of her hand and leading her home.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/his-unlikely-lover-unwanted-3/page-84.html","bookId":1836,"book":{"id":1836,"title":"His Unlikely Lover (Unwanted #3)","description":"Storyline: Bobbi Richmond has always been in love with her best friend, Gabe Braddock, even if Gabe, who works for her media mogul father, has always treated Bobbi like a kid sister, calling her “Runt.” After a tipsy Bobbi kisses Gabe at a party, Gabe is surprised to find “Runt” becoming the object of his fantasies, and Bobbi is shocked to find her advances suddenly reciprocated. When Gabe suggests adding “benefits” to their friendship—while keeping their new arrangement secret from their families, of course—should Bobbi feel flattered, or insulted by his insistence on casual sex? Are they even a match? Slick and conservative Gabe dates coiffed blondes, while the tomboyish Bobbi spends much more time fixing cars than her hair. When Gabe’s twin brother, Chase, senses something’s up between the old friends, he forces Gabe to confront his real feelings for Bobbi—and decide whether or not he could live without her.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/his-unlikely-lover-unwanted-3.jpg","author":"Natasha Anders","type":"Romance","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/his-unlikely-lover-unwanted-3.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:03 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:33:25 AM"}}
