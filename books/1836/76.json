{"id":75242,"no":76,"title":"Page 76","content":"Bobbi squeaked in shock, overwhelmed by the sudden influx of sensation that raced through her body like an addictive narcotic. She was flat on her back in the middle of his bed by this time and had no clear idea of how she had gotten there. Her baggy football shorts were gone and she was wearing just white cotton panties—their only concession to her femininity being the tiny pink lace borders that were hemmed around the edges.\n Gabe was balanced above her with one of his muscular, naked thighs thrust between hers. He continued to do amazing things to her with his clever mouth and his industrious hands. His mouth moved back and forth between one painfully distended, raspberry-red nipple and the other before finding her lips again, plundering ruthlessly, taking as much as he was giving.\n “Bobbi.” He lifted his head, his voice was thick, slurred, and almost unrecognizable. “My darling Bobbi . . .” He flipped over onto his back and dragged her with him so that she was straddling his thigh.\n Gabe knew that Bobbi was unaware of the sexy picture she made, with her breasts spilling over the top of her bra, her nipples and lips swollen and red. Her eyes looked drugged with pleasure and she smiled widely, delighting in her new position.\n His hands framed her face and tugged it closer to his own, he lifted his head to claim her lips but she pulled back at the last second and instead struggled to tug his T-shirt off. He sat up and helped her drag it up over his muscular, tanned chest, impatient to feel her hands on him.\n “Oh,” she sighed contentedly, when she finally managed to stroke his skin. Her small hands found his hard nipples and her fingers tugged a bit too enthusiastically. Gabe yelped in pain and her eyes filled with remorse. She lowered her head and kissed away the sting, licking and sucking almost delicately, until Gabe thought that he would go out of his mind with pleasure.\n “Oh yes, sweetheart,” he groaned, his hands framing her face again. “Yes . . .”\n Bobbi moved over to the other nugget and paid it homage as well, savoring the salty taste and warm, musky scent of him.\n “You’re so gorgeous,” she whispered against his flesh.\n “God, I want you so much, Bobbi mine.” She lifted her head to meet his tormented regard and nodded slowly, her eyes alive with warmth.\n “I want you too.”\n “I’ve missed you,” he confided, sitting up, so that she was wantonly cradled in his lap, her legs wrapped around his waist and her bottom snugly tucked against the swollen flesh pushing against the confines of his shorts. Her eyes filled with tears as the emotion of the moment overwhelmed her.\n “I’ve missed you too.”\n “Don’t cry,” he whispered, kissing away the errant tears that had slipped down her cheeks.\n “I can’t seem to stop,” she confessed, a sob catching in her throat.\n “Ssh, sweetheart,” he said, kissing her again. The caress so gentle it just prompted more tears from her. He lifted his head. “What’s this now, sweetheart? Why the tears?”\n She shook her head, unable to verbalize what she was feeling and buried her face against his chest, leaving moisture on his skin. She planted hungry kisses all over his chest before inching her hands down to the hard column sawing up against her cleft. Her lips followed her hands down until she was bent over his shorts, her breath washing against his flat abdomen as she tugged at the drawstring.\n Gabe groaned when she managed to undo the knot and he lifted his hips to make it easier for her to tug his shorts and briefs down past his thighs. He lifted his head from the bed to watch what she was doing and Bobbi enjoyed the ripple of muscles on his abdomen and torso at the movement.\n “Bobbi, what are you doing?” he asked, his voice a tormented whisper. She didn’t bother to reply, allowing her actions to speak for her when she took hold of his length in both of her hands and stroked it slowly from top to bottom.\n “Oh, sweet Jesus,” he grated, his hips coming off the bed at her touch. She smiled at him from where she was crouched at his center before dropping an experimental kiss on the sensitive tip of his shaft. “Stop! Bobbi . . . don’t.”\n But she did, her mouth enveloped him, and what she couldn’t fit, her hands took care of. Gabe felt like the top of his head was about to blow off, and he knew he wouldn’t be able to last long if she continued this. It nearly killed him, but he dragged her off and back under him. They were both completely naked in no time at all and he placed his hands on her inner thighs and opened her up to his ravenous gaze. His throat went dry at how perfect she was and he was soon repaying the favor that she had so surprisingly bestowed on him moments before.\n Bobbi squealed, tears long forgotten, as Gabe used his very talented tongue on her to maximum effect. It wasn’t long before her entire body clenched and she came with a moan and quiet gasp. He gave her no time to recover; he dragged a condom from his nightstand drawer and put it on, while Bobbi drank in the sight of his splendid nakedness. She was intoxicated by him and aware of nothing more than Gabe and what he could to her with his hands, mouth, and body.\n She joyfully welcomed him back into her body, loving how absolutely perfect it felt to have him inside of her again. He moved slowly, gently, and allowed them both to fully savor the physical and emotional closeness of the moment.\n “You’re amazing,” he whispered, and she wrapped her arms around him in response and held him even closer. She could feel his thrusts in every part of her body and it drove her wild. She softly moaned every time he withdrew, lamenting his departure, but gasped happily with every return stroke. Her orgasm snuck up on her and sent her spinning madly out of control before she was fully prepared for it. Her breath caught and held. She didn’t think she could physically stand the oh-so-exquisite torture! How could anybody stand it? But suddenly he was there, calming her down, whispering endearments in her ear and setting her crazily tilted world to rights again. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/his-unlikely-lover-unwanted-3/page-76.html","bookId":1836,"book":{"id":1836,"title":"His Unlikely Lover (Unwanted #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Bobbi Richmond has always been in love with her best friend, Gabe Braddock, even if Gabe, who works for her media mogul father, has always treated Bobbi like a kid sister, calling her “Runt.” \n After a tipsy Bobbi kisses Gabe at a party, Gabe is surprised to find “Runt” becoming the object of his fantasies, and Bobbi is shocked to find her advances suddenly reciprocated.
