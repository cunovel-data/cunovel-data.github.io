{"id":21310,"no":59,"title":"Chapter 7","content":"The door was opened to him by a tall young woman in a grey dress covered by an apron. Reuben was struck by that apron, for it was not the sacking kind to which he was accustomed, or the plain white muslin which his women-folk wore on Sundays, but a coarse brick-coloured cotton, hanging from her shoulders like a pinafore. The girl\u0027s face above it was not pretty, but exceptionally vivid—\"vivid\" was the word, not prominent in Reuben\u0027s vocabulary, which flashed into his mind when he saw her. Her colouring was pale, and her features were small and irregular, her hair was very frizzy and quite black, while her grey eyes were at once the narrowest and the liveliest he had ever seen. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry—father\u0027s not at home,\" she said in answer to his question. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But I t?ald him as I wur coming over—it\u0027s about that Handshut.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She smiled. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m afraid father forgets things. But come in, he\u0027s bound to be home to his dinner soon.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Reuben grumbled and muttered to himself as he crossed the threshold—small fry like these Jurys must[Pg 211] not be allowed to think that he had any time to spare. The young woman led him into the kitchen and offered him a seat. Reuben took it and crossed his legs, looking appraisingly round the room, which was poorly furnished, but beautifully kept, with some attempts at decoration. There was a print of Rossetti\u0027s \"Annunciation\" above the meal-chest, and a shelf of books by the fireplace. It all struck him as strange and rather contemptible. He remembered what he had been told about the Jurys, who had only just come to Cheat Land. Tom Jury had, so rumour said, kept a bookshop in Hastings, but trade had gone badly, and as his health demanded an outdoor life and country air, charitable friends had established him on a small holding. He had an invalid wife, and one daughter, who was not very strong either—an ignoble family. \\n\\n \\n\\n The daughter must be the girl who was talking to him now. She sat on a little stool by the fire, and had brought out some sewing. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You come from Odiam, don\u0027t you?\" she asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, that\u0027s it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is Odiam that farm near Totease?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Reuben looked as if he had swallowed the poker. He stared at her to see if she were making fun of him, but her bright eyes were quite innocent. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes,\" he said huskily—\"it is.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We\u0027ve only been here a month, so I haven\u0027t got the neighbourhood quite clear. You see I can\u0027t often go out, as my mother\u0027s generally in bed, and I have all the house-work to do. That\u0027s why my father has to have a man to help him out of doors. It\u0027s a pity, for wages are so high—Handshut\u0027s leaving us because we could do with someone cheaper and less experienced.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Reuben liked her voice, with its town modulation, the only vestige of Sussex taint being a slight drawl. It struck him that Alice Jury was a \"lady,\" and that he was not condescending very much in speaking to her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s unaccountable hard to know what to do about labour. Now as these fellers are gitting eddicated they think no end of theirselves and \u0027ull ask justabout anything in wages—as if a man hoed turnups any better for being able to read and write.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But don\u0027t you think he does?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No—I d?an\u0027t. I\u0027m all ag?unst teaching poor people anything and setting them above theirselves. It\u0027s different fur their betters. Now I\u0027ve got six boys, and they can all read and write and cast accounts.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Six boys, have you? Are they grown up?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, the youngest\u0027s sixteen.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And do they help you on the farm?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes—leastways four of \u0027em do. Two have—have left home.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I suppose they didn\u0027t care for farming?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"One\u0027s in prison, and t\u0027other I turned away.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Reuben had no idea why he said this. It must have been the way her eyes were fixed on him, glowing above bistred shadows. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, indeed!—how sad.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He flushed the colour of her apron. What a fool he was!—and yet after all she would be bound to hear the truth sooner or later; he had only been beforehand. All the same he was surprised at himself. A sudden tide of anger went over him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sad fur them, I reckon, but not fur me. I\u0027m well shut of them.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you miss them at all?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Naun particular. Robert he wur good and plodding-like, but you couldn\u0027t trust his stacking, and he\u0027d be all nohow wud the horses—and Albert he\u0027d shirk everything wotsumdever, he\u0027d go off into dreams in the middle of killing a pig—surelye!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But in themselves, I mean.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Wot\u0027s that—in themselves?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, as boys, as sons, not as farm-servants.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I d?an\u0027t never think of them that way. One\u0027s no good to me wudout t\u0027other.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Alice Jury said nothing, and Reuben began to feel vaguely uncomfortable. What queer eyes she had!—they seemed to bore into him like nails. He suddenly rose to his feet. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"See here—I must be going.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But father won\u0027t be long now.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry—I can\u0027t wait. I\u0027ve a load of field-bean coming in. I\u0027ll be round ag?un to-morrow.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What time?—and I\u0027ll promise father shall be here to see you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"About eleven, say. Good-bye, miss.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Good-bye.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She went with him to the door. A great lump of phlox grew on either side of it. She stood between them, and suddenly pointed out over Jury\u0027s miserable little root-patch towards Boarzell, heaving its great hummocks against the east. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What\u0027s that?\" she asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2094/59431.html","bookId":524,"book":{"id":524,"title":"Sussex Gorse The Story of a Fight","description":"简介： Boarzell Fair had been held every year on Boarzell Moor for as long as the oldest in Peasmarsh could remember.
