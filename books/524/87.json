{"id":21338,"no":87,"title":"Chapter 19","content":"Already the turnpike gates had disappeared from the greater part of Sussex, but they still lingered in the Rye district, for various reasons, not always bearing close[Pg 305] inspection. There had been an anti-toll party both before and after the famous Scott\u0027s Float gate had catastrophically ended Reuben\u0027s political career—and at last this had carried the day. All the gates were to come down except those on the Military Road, and the neighbourhood was to celebrate their abolition by burning them in tar. \\n\\n \\n\\n Reuben, still proud and sore, stood aloof from local jollities—besides, he had heard that there were to be some cheap milkers for sale at Cranbrook Fair, and he was anxious to add a little to his dairy stock. Though a large milk-round was out of the question, the compensation money he had received from Government would allow him to carry on a small dairy business, as in humbler days. Of course, the fact that he had lost over sixty cows from foot-and-mouth disease would materially damage his prospects even in a limited sphere, but a farm which let its dairy rot was doomed to failure, and Reuben was still untamed by experience, and hoped much from small beginnings. \\n\\n \\n\\n So early that morning he drove off in his gig, accompanied by Pete, who had a good eye for cattle, and had moreover challenged the Canterbury Kid for a purse of five guineas. Rose watched them go, and waved good-bye unnoticed to her man, as he leaned forward over the reins, thinking only of how much he could spare for a yearling. She went back into the house, and stoned plums. After dinner she mended the children\u0027s clothes, with a little grimace for the faded ribbons and tattered frills which Reuben would not allow her to renew. Then she took the baby and little David for an airing in the orchard—Handshut, raking unromantically in the midden, saw her sitting, a splash of faded violet under an apple tree—then she bathed them and put them to bed. \\n\\n \\n\\n All this was a propitiatory offering to the god of the hearth, who, however, did not take the slightest notice,[Pg 306] or stay as he so easily might (so the scripture saith) that hunger for her beloved which was gnawing at the young wife\u0027s heart. Instead, it seemed to grow in its devouring pain—her domesticity stimulated rather than deadened it, and by the time her day\u0027s tasks were over it had eaten up her poor heart like a dainty, and she was its unresisting prey. \\n\\n \\n\\n After the children were in bed she changed her dress, putting on the best she had—a washing silk with pansies sewn over it, one of her wedding gowns. She frowned at it as she had frowned at the babies\u0027 dresses—it was so old-fashioned, and worn in places. She suddenly found herself wishing that she loved Reuben so much as not to mind wearing old clothes for his sake. For the first time she could visualise such a state of affairs, for she had met the man for whom she would have worn rags. If only that man had been Reuben, her lawful husband, instead of another! \"But I\u0027ll be true to him! I\u0027ll be true to him!\" she murmured, and found comfort in the words till she realised that it was the first time that she had ever glimpsed the possibility of not being true. \\n\\n \\n\\n She went down into the kitchen, where Caro was baking suet. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Caro, I\u0027m going out to see the gates burned. I expect I\u0027ll be back before Ben is, but if I\u0027m not, tell him where I\u0027m gone.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You can\u0027t go by yourself—he wudn\u0027t like it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m not going by myself—Handshut\u0027s taking me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Caro\u0027s suety hands fell to her sides. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Rose—you know—how can you?—that\u0027s worse than alone, surelye!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nonsense! What\u0027s more natural that one of my servants should come with me, since my husband can\u0027t?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Your servant....\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, my servant.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Caro, regardless of the suet on her hands, hid her face in them. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, Rose, I can\u0027t tell him—I daren\u0027t. Why, he turned away Handshut because of you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He did not, miss—you\u0027re impudent!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, why shud f?ather git shut of the best drover he ever had on his farm, if it ?un\u0027t——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Be quiet! I won\u0027t hear such stuff. I\u0027m not going to be a prisoner, and miss my fun just because you and Ben are jealous fools.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But I daren\u0027t tell him where you\u0027ve agone.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I dare say you won\u0027t have to—I\u0027m not staying out all night.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She laughed one of her coarse screaming laughs, with the additional drawback of mirthlessness; then she went out of the room, leaving Caro sobbing into suety palms. \\n\\n \\n\\n Outside in the yard, Handshut stood by the pump, apparently absorbed in studying the first lights of Triangulum as they kindled one by one in the darkening sky. \\n\\n \\n\\n Rose pattered up to him in the shabby white kid shoes that had been so trim and smart five years ago. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve changed my mind.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then you ?un\u0027t coming.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, I am.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then you haven\u0027t changed it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2094/59459.html","bookId":524,"book":{"id":524,"title":"Sussex Gorse The Story of a Fight","description":"简介： Boarzell Fair had been held every year on Boarzell Moor for as long as the oldest in Peasmarsh could remember.
