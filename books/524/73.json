{"id":21324,"no":73,"title":"Chapter 5","content":"Reuben and Rose were married in the January of \u002770. It was the earliest date compatible with the stocking of her wardrobe, a business which immediately absorbed her to the exclusion of everything else. \n \n Meantime Reuben, having repapered the parlour and given a new coat of whitewash to the best bedroom ceiling, discussed settlements with old Lardner. These did not turn out as large as he had hoped—the old man was close, and attempts on his generosity only resulted[Pg 257] in embarrassing doubts as to the disinterestedness of his son-in-law\u0027s affections. Reuben comforted himself with the thought that Lardner most certainly had a cancer. \n \n At the wedding Rose fairly dazed the onlookers. She wore a dress of heavy white satin, with a white lace veil—and a bustle. It was the first bustle that had ever been seen in Peasmarsh, or even in Rye. In itself it was devastating enough, but it soon acquired a prophetic and metaphorical significance which made it even more impressive. Spectators saw in it the forecast of Odiam\u0027s downfall—\"He can\u0027t stand that,\" said Brazier, the new man at Totease, \"she\u0027s a Jezebubble.\"—\"Only it ?un\u0027t her head as she\u0027s tired this time,\" said Ticehurst.—\"She shud have worn it in front of her, and then we shud have bin interested,\" said Cooper of Kitchenhour. \n \n Alice Jury and her father were in church. Reuben saw them as he marched up the aisle with an enormous flower in his buttonhole, accompanied by Ginner of Socknersh as his best man. It struck him that she looked more pretty and animated than usual, in a woolly red dress and a little fur cap under which her eyes were bright as a robin\u0027s. Even then he felt a little offended and perplexed by her behaviour—she should have drooped—it would have been more becoming if she had drooped. \n \n The remnants of his family were in a front pew—Pete with an elaborately curled forelock, Jemmy casting the scent of cheap hair oil into the prevalent miasma of camphor and moth-killer, and between the two boys, Caro in an unbecoming hat which she wore at a wrong angle, while her dark restless eyes devoured Rose\u0027s creamy smartness, from her satin shoes to the wave of curling-irons in her hair. Harry had been left at home—he was in an impossible mood, tormented by some dark current of memory, wandering from room to room[Pg 258] as he muttered—\"Another wedding—another wedding—we\u0027re always having weddings in this house.\" \n \n After the ceremony nearly a hundred guests were fed at Starvecrow. All the most important farmers of the neighbourhood were there, except of course Realf of Grandturzel. Rose was like her name-flower, flushed and scented. Very different from his earlier bride, she sat beside Reuben with head erect and smiling lips—she drank with everyone, and the wine deepened the colour of her cheeks and made her eyes like stars. She talked, she laughed, she ate, she was so happy that her glances, full of bold languor, swept round the table, resting on all present as well as the chosen man—she was a gay wife. \n \n Dancing at weddings was dying out as a local fashion, so when the breakfast was over the guests melted away, having eaten and drunk themselves into a desire for sleep. Reuben\u0027s family went home. He and Rose lingered a little with her uncle, then as the January night came crisping into the sky and fields, he drove her to Odiam in his gig, as long ago he had driven Naomi. She leaned against his shoulder, for he wanted both hands for his horse, and her hair tickled his neck. She was silent for about the first time that day, and as eager for the kisses he could give her while he drove as Naomi had been shy of them. Above in the cold black sky a hundred pricks of fire shuddered like sparks—the lump of Boarzell was blocked against a powder of stars. \n \n At Odiam Rose shook off her seriousness. Supper was ready, and undaunted by the huge meal she had already eaten, she sat down to it with a hearty appetite. Her step-children stared at her curiously—Rose had a gust of affection for them. Poor things!—their lives had been so crude and dull and innocent. She must give them a little brightness now, soften the yoke of Reuben\u0027s tyranny—that girl Caro, for instance, she must[Pg 259] give her some pretty clothes and show her how to arrange her hair becomingly. \n \n Supper was a very gay meal—the gayest there had ever been at Odiam. Rose laughed and talked, as at Starvecrow, and soon her husband and the boys were laughing with her. Some of the things she said were rather daring, and Caro had only a dim idea of what she meant, but Rose\u0027s eyes rolling mischievously under the long lashes, and the tip of her tongue showing between her lips, gave her words a devilish bite even if only half understood. Somehow the whole atmosphere of the Odiam kitchen was changed—it was like the lifting of a curtain, the glimpsing of a life where all was gay, where love and ambition and all solemn things were the stuff of laughter. \n \n The boys beat the handles of their knives on the table and rolled in their chairs with wide-open mouths as if they would burst; Reuben leaned back with a great pride and softening in his eyes, round which many hard lines had traced themselves of late; Caro\u0027s lips were parted and she seemed half enchanted, half bewildered by the other woman\u0027s careless merriment. Only Harry took no interest and looked dissatisfied—\"Another wedding,\" he mumbled as he dribbled his food unnoticed over the cloth—\"we\u0027re always having weddings in this house.\" \n \n It was strange that during this gay meal the strongest link was forged between Rose and Caro. Two natures more utterly unlike it would be hard to find—Caro\u0027s starved ignorance of love and aged familiarity with dustier matters made her the antithesis of Rose, a child in all things save those of the affections; but the two women\u0027s hearts met in their laughter. It was Rose who invited, Caro who responded, for Rose in spite of her years and inexperience had the one advantage which made her the older of the two. She was drawn to Caro partly from essential kindness, partly because she [Pg 260]appreciated the luxury of pitying her—Caro responded with all the shy devotion of a warped nature going out towards one who enjoys that for which it unconsciously pines. Rose\u0027s beauty, jollity, and happiness made her a goddess to the less fortunate girl. \n \n After supper Rose turned towards her. \n \n \"Will you come up and help me unpack?\" \n \n Caro flushed with pleasure—a light had kindled in her grey life, and she found herself looking forward to days of basking. \n \n They went up together to the huge low-raftered bedroom, which struck horribly cold. \n \n \"Ugh!\" said Rose—\"no fire!\" \n \n \"But it\u0027s a bedroom.\" \n \n \"That\u0027s no reason for not having a fire. I shall freeze. Let\u0027s have the servant up to light one.\" \n \n \"Oh, no. I\u0027ll light it; Mary\u0027s busy clearing the table. But I reckon as f?ather w?an\u0027t be pleased.\" \n \n \"I\u0027ll make him pleased. You leave father to me for the future.\" \n \n Caro fetched some wood and turf and laid the fire, to which Rose applied a match, feeling that by this she had done her share of the work. Then they began to unpack. There were two trunks full of clothes, and Rose complicated matters by refusing to take things out as they came but diving after various articles she particularly wanted. \n \n \"I want my blue negleegy—I must show you my blue negleegy,\" she panted, up to her elbows in underlinen. \n \n \"Oh, here it is! what do you think of it?\" \n \n \"It\u0027s silk!\" said Caro in a hoarse whisper. \n \n \"Of course it is—and the very best silk too. I\u0027ll put it on. Please undo my dress.\" \n \n Caro helped her off with her wedding-dress, and after having recovered her breath, which she lost completely at the sight of the lace on her chemise, she helped her arrange the \"negleegy,\" and watched her open-mouthed[Pg 261] as she posed in it before the fragment of looking-glass. \n \n \"Isn\u0027t it chick?\" said Rose, \"I got it in Hastings—they say it is copied from a Paris model. Now let\u0027s go on with the unpacking.\" \n \n They went on—that is to say Rose leaned back in her chair and directed Caro as she took the things out of the trunks. The girl was fairly bewildered by what she saw—the laced chemises, the flounced petticoats, the dainty nightgowns with transparent necks. \"But you\u0027ll show through,\" she said in tones of horror as she displayed one of these, and could not understand why Rose rolled in her chair with laughter. \n \n There were little pots of cream and bottles of hair-lotion, there were ebony-backed brushes, patent leather shoes, kid gloves, all sorts of marvels which Caro had seen nowhere but in shops. As she unpacked she felt a kind of soreness in her heart. Why should Rose have all these beautiful things, these laces, these perfumes, these silks and ribbons, while Caro wore nothing but stuff and calico or smelt of anything sweeter than milk? As she glanced at Rose, leaning back in the most comfortable chair to be found in that uncomfortable room—the firelight dancing on the silken ripples of her gown, her neck and arms gleaming through clouds of lace—the soreness woke into a pain. Rose had something more even than silks and laces. She had love. It was love that made her hold her chin so proudly, it was love that made her cheeks flush and her eyes glow. And no one had ever loved Caro—she had never heard a man\u0027s voice in tenderness, or felt even so much as a man\u0027s hand fondle hers.... \n \n \"Caro, would you mind brushing my hair?\" \n \n Rose was taking out the pins, and curls and tendrils of hair began to fall on her shoulders. Caro took the brush, and swept it over the soft mass, gleaming like spun glass. A subtle perfume rose from it, the rub of[Pg 262] it on her hand was like silk. Rose\u0027s eyes closed as the brush stroked her, and her lips parted slowly into a smile. \n \n Then suddenly, without warning, all this love and happiness and possession became too much for Caro—she dropped the brush and the scented hair, and burst into passionate tears. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2094/59445.html","bookId":524,"book":{"id":524,"title":"Sussex Gorse The Story of a Fight","description":"简介： Boarzell Fair had been held every year on Boarzell Moor for as long as the oldest in Peasmarsh could remember.
