{"id":21340,"no":89,"title":"Chapter 21","content":"\\n\\n The walk home was dreary, for Rose and Handshut misunderstood each other, and yet loved each other too. She was silent, almost shamefaced, and he was a little disgusted with her—he felt that she had misled him, and in his soreness added \"willingly.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n They scarcely spoke, and the night spread round them its web of pondering silence. Aldebaran guttered above Kent, and the blurred patch of the Pleiades hung over the curded fogs that hid the Rother. There was no wind, but every now and then the grass rippled and the leaves fluttered, while a low hissing sound went through the trees. Sometimes from the distance came the shouts of some revellers still at large, echoing weirdly over the moon-steeped fields, and divinely purged by space and night. \\n\\n \\n\\n Sobs were still thick in Rose\u0027s throat, when they came to Handshut\u0027s cottage, a little tumble-down place, shaped like a rabbit\u0027s head. She stopped. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t come any further.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It would be better if I wasn\u0027t seen with you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He looked at her white face. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027re frighted.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes—and I\u0027m coming wud you, surelye.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I should be frightened if you came.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She managed to persuade him to go his different way—though the actual moment of their parting was always a blur in her memory. Afterwards she could not remember if they had kissed, touched hands, or parted without a word. Her throat was still full of sobs when she came to Odiam; she was panting, too, for she had run all the way—she did not know why. \\n\\n \\n\\n The house was swimming in the light of the western moon. Its strange curves and bulges, its kiln-shaped ends, and great waving sprawl of roof all shone in a white glassy brilliance, which was somehow akin to peace. There was a soft flutter of wind in the orchard and in the sentinel poplars, while now and then came that distant night-purged scrap of song: \\n\\n \"Soles, plaice, and dabs, \\n\\n Rate, skate, and crabs. \\n\\n God save the Queen!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Rose wondered uneasily what time it was. Surely it could not be very late, and yet the house was shut up and the windows dark. \\n\\n \\n\\n She gently rattled the door-handle. There was no denying it—the house was locked up. It must be later than she thought—that walk on the Rother levels must have been longer than it had seemed to her thirsty love. A thrill of fear went through her. She hoped Reuben would not be angry. She was his dutiful wife. \\n\\n \\n\\n She stood hesitating on the doorstep. Should she knock? Then a terrible thought struck her. Reuben must have meant to lock her out. Otherwise he would have sat up for her, however late she had been. She started trembling all over, and felt her skin grow damp. \\n\\n \\n\\n She began to knock, first softly, then more desperately. She must get in. Nothing was to be heard except her own despairing din—the house seemed plunged in[Pg 316] sleep. Rose\u0027s fear grew, spread black bat\u0027s wings, and darkened all her thoughts—for she knew that someone must have heard her, she could not make all this racket quite unheard. \\n\\n \\n\\n What could she do? Caro slept at the back of the house, and it struck her that she had better go round, and throw up some earth at her window. Perhaps Caro would let her in. She stepped back from the door, and was just turning the corner of the house when a window suddenly shot open above her, and Reuben\u0027s tousled head looked out. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There\u0027s no use your trying to git in.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Rose gave a faint scream. In the moonlight her husband\u0027s face looked distorted, while his voice came thick and unnatural. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ben!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Go away. Go away to where you\u0027ve come from. I shan\u0027t let you in.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You can\u0027t keep me out here. It isn\u0027t my fault I\u0027m late—and I\u0027m not so very late, either.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s one o\u0027clock o\u0027 the marnun.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She felt her heart grow sick. If she had been happy for four hours, why, in God\u0027s name, had they not passed like four hours instead of like four minutes? \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ben, I swear I didn\u0027t know. I was up to no harm, I promise you. Please, please—oh please let me in!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not I—at one o\u0027clock o\u0027 the marnun—after you\u0027ve bin all night wud a——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ben, I swear I\u0027m your true wife.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She fell against the wall, and her hair, disordered by embraces, suddenly streamed over her shoulders. The sight of it made Reuben wild. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Git off—before I t?ake my gun and shoot you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, Ben!...\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"H?ald your false tongue. You\u0027re no wife o\u0027 mine from this day forrard. I w?an\u0027t be cuckolded in my own house.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n His face was swollen, his eyes rolled—he looked almost as if he had been drinking. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ben, don\u0027t drive me away. I\u0027ve been true to you, indeed I have, and Handshut\u0027s going to-morrow. Let me in—please let me in. I swear I\u0027ve been true.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I want none o\u0027 your lying swears—at one o\u0027clock o\u0027 the marnun. Go back to the man you\u0027ve come from—he\u0027ll believe you easier nor I.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ben, I\u0027m your wife.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I tell you, you\u0027re no wife of mine. I\u0027m shut of you—you false, fair, lying, scarlet woman. You needn\u0027t cry and weep, nuther—none \u0027ull say as Ben Backfield wur a soft man fur woman\u0027s tears.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He shut the window with a slam. For some moments Rose stood leaning against the wall, her sobs shaking her. Then, still sobbing, she turned and walked away. \\n\\n \\n\\n She walked slowly down the drive till she came to the little path that led across the fields to Handshut\u0027s cottage. A light gleamed from the window, and she crept towards it through tall moon-smudged grass—while from the distance came for the last time: \\n\\n \"Soles, plaice, and dabs, \\n\\n Rate, skate, and crabs. \\n\\n God save the Queen!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2094/59461.html","bookId":524,"book":{"id":524,"title":"Sussex Gorse The Story of a Fight","description":"简介： Boarzell Fair had been held every year on Boarzell Moor for as long as the oldest in Peasmarsh could remember.
