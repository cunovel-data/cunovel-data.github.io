{"id":21354,"no":103,"title":"Chapter 10","content":"Except for a steady maintenance of prosperity by dint of hard work, the year was uneventful. Autumn passed, and nothing broke the strenuous monotony of the days, not even news of the absent children. Then came an evening in winter when Reuben, Pete, and Harry were sitting in front of the kitchen fire. Reuben and his son were half asleep, Harry was mumbling to himself and playing with a piece of string. A great quiet was wrapped round the house, and a great darkness, pricked by winking stars. The barns were shut, the steamings of the midden were nipped by brooding frosts—now and then the dull movements of some stalled animal could be heard, but only from the yard; in the house there was silence except for the singing fire, and Harry\u0027s low muttering which seldom rose into words. Then suddenly there was a knock at the door. Reuben started, and Pete awoke noisily. Harry was frightened and dropped his string, crying because he could not find it. The knock came again, and this time Pete crossed the room yawning, and opened the door. For a moment he stood in front of it, while the icy wind swept into the room. Then he dashed back to Reuben\u0027s chair. \"Father—it\u0027s Albert!\" Reuben sprang to his feet. He was still only half awake, and he rubbed his eyes as he stared at the figure framed in the doorway. Then suddenly he pulled himself together. \"Come in, and shut the door behind you.\" The figure did not move. Reuben took a step towards it, and then it tottered forward, and to his horror fell against him, almost bearing him to the floor. Pete, who had recovered his faculties to some extent, helped support his brother. But he had fainted clean away, and the only thing to do was to let him down as gently as possible. \"Lordy!\" said Pete, and stooped over Albert, his hands on his knees. \"You\u0027re sure that\u0027s Albert?\" asked Reuben, though he really did not doubt it for a moment. \"Course I am. That\u0027s his face sure enough, though he\u0027s as thin as wire.\" \"It\u0027s nigh fifteen year since he went away. Wot did he want to come back fur?\" \"I reckon he\u0027s half starved—and he looks ill too.\" \"Well, he\u0027s swooneded away, anyhow. Can\u0027t you do something to m?ake him sensible?\" \"Poor feller,\" said Pete, and scratched his head. Reuben was irritated by this display of sentiment. \"You needn\u0027t go pitying him, nuther—he\u0027s a lousy Radical traitor. You do something to m?ake him sensible and out he goes.\" At this juncture Albert opened his eyes. \"Hullo,\" he said feebly. \"Hullo,\" said Pete. Something in his brother\u0027s pitiable condition seemed to have touched him. Albert sat up—then asked for some water. Pete fetched a jug, which he held awkwardly to Albert\u0027s lips. Then he helped him to a chair, and began to unlace his boots. \"Stop that,\" shouted Reuben—\"he ?un\u0027t to stay here.\" \"You\u0027ll let me stop the night,\" pleaded Albert. \"I\u0027ll explain things when I\u0027m better. I can\u0027t now.\" \"You can go to the Cocks—I w?an\u0027t have you in my house.\" \"But I haven\u0027t got a penny—cleaned myself out for my railway ticket. I\u0027ve walked all the way from the station, and my lungs are bad.\" \"Wot did you come here fur?\" \"It struck me that you might have some natural affection.\" \"Me!—fur a hemmed Radical! You\u0027d better have saved your money, young feller—I\u0027m shut of you.\" \"If you\u0027re still harping on my politics,\" said Albert fretfully, \"you needn\u0027t worry. Either side can go to the devil, for all I care. I suppose it\u0027s natural to brood over things down here, but in London one forgets a rumpus fifteen years old.\" \"I\u0027ll never disremember the way you shamed me in \u002765.\" \"I don\u0027t ask you to disremember anything. Only let me have supper and a bed, and to-morrow——\" A fit of coughing interrupted him. He strained and shook from head to foot. He had no handkerchief, and spat blood on the floor. \"F?ather!\" cried Pete, \"you can\u0027t turn him out lik this.\" \"He\u0027s shamming,\" said Reuben. \"Quite so,\" said Albert, who seemed to have learned sarcasm in exile—\"h?morrhage is so deuced easy to sham.\" \"He\u0027s come back to git money out of me,\" said Reuben, \"but he shan\u0027t have a penny—I\u0027ve none to spare.\" \"I don\u0027t ask for that to-night—all I ask is food and shelter, same as you\u0027d give to a dog.\" \"Well, I\u0027ll leave you to Pete,\" said Reuben, and walked out of the room. He considered this the more dignified course, and went upstairs to bed. The brothers were left alone, except for Harry, who was busy imitating Albert\u0027s cough, much to his own satisfaction. Pete fetched some soup from the larder and heated it up to a tepid condition; he also produced bread and cold bacon, which the prodigal could not touch. Albert sat hunched up by the fire, coughing and shivering. He had not altered much since he left Odiam; he was thin and hectic, and had an unshaved look about him, also there were a few grey streaks in his hair—otherwise he was the same. His manner was the same too, though his voice had changed completely, and he had lost his Sussex accent. Pete ministered to him with a strange devotion, which he carried finally to the pitch of putting him into his own bed. The absence of so many of the children did not make much more room in the house, as Reuben\u0027s ideas on sleeping had always been compact—also there were the little boys, the new dairy woman, and a big store of potatoes. Pete\u0027s large untidy bed was the only available accommodation, and Albert was glad of it, for he had reached the last stage of exhaustion. \"I bet you anything,\" he said before he fell asleep, \"that now I\u0027m here the old boy won\u0027t be able to turn me out, however much he wants to.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2094/59475.html","bookId":524,"book":{"id":524,"title":"Sussex Gorse The Story of a Fight","description":"简介： Boarzell Fair had been held every year on Boarzell Moor for as long as the oldest in Peasmarsh could remember.
