{"id":21365,"no":114,"title":"Chapter 6","content":"The boys were now sixteen and eighteen, fine, manly young fellows, working cheerfully on Odiam and rejoicing their father\u0027s heart. Reuben watched over them sometimes with an odd kind of anxiety—they were so satisfactory that he felt it could not last. He remembered that conversation he had overheard in the trap on the way home from Rye, and though nothing had happened since to remind him of it or cause him fresh alarm, he could never quite shake off the cold thrills it had given him. Besides, David and William had come to a dangerous age, they were beginning to form opinions and ideas of[Pg 398] their own, they were beginning to choose their own friends and pastimes. But what Reuben distrusted most was their affection for each other, it was more fundamental to his anxieties than any outside independence. From childhood they had been inseparable, but in past years he had put this down to the common interests of their play, for there were few boys of their own age on the neighbouring farms. But now they were grown up the devotion persisted—they still did everything together, work or play. Reuben knew that they had secrets from him, their union gave him a sense of isolation. They were fond of him, but he was not to them what they were to each other, and his remoteness seemed to grow with the years. In his alarm he made plans to separate them. He discovered that the big attic they slept in was not healthy, and moved their beds to two rooms divided by his own. He now felt that he had put an end to those bedtime conferences which must have done so much to unite the brothers and set him at a distance. His vigilance increased when their first love affairs began. At first they would gabble innocently to him about pretty girls they had seen in Rye, but they soon found out such conversation was most unwelcome. Reuben looked upon love as the biggest curse and snare of life; if David and William fell in love they would lose interest in Odiam, they would do something silly like Robert, or mad like Caro, or bad like Rose. Love was the enemy of Odiam, and Reuben having trodden it down himself was not going to see it rise and stamp on his boys. He gave them the benefit of his experience in no measured terms: \"If you fall in love wud a gal you can\u0027t say no to her, and she\u0027ll find it out lamentable soon. When either of you boys finds a nice strong, sensible gal, wud a bit o\u0027 money, and not self-willed, such as \u0027ull be a good darter-in-law\u0027 to me, I shan\u0027t have nothing to say ag?unst it.[Pg 399] But d?an\u0027t you go running after petticoats and m?ake fools of yourselves and disgrace Odiam, and call it being in love. Love m?akes you soft, and if you\u0027re soft you might just as well be buried fur all the good you\u0027re likely to do yourself.\" David and William seemed much impressed, and Reuben congratulated himself. Two days later he went into the dairy to give an order, and saw one of the dairy girls bending over a pan of cream. Something in her attitude and in the soft curly down on the nape of her neck reminded him of Naomi and that early courting scene, now nearly fifty years ago; but before he had time to recall it, David came in by another door, not seeing his father, and running lightly up to the dairymaid suddenly kissed the back of her neck and ran away. She turned round with a scream, just in time to see him disappearing through one door, while in the other stood Reuben with grimly folded arms. He gave her a week\u0027s wages and sent her away. \"Where\u0027s Agnes?\" asked David with laboured carelessness a day or two later. \"She wasted her time,\" said Reuben, \"so I got shut of her.\" \"She\u0027s gone!\" \"Yes—back to her parents at Tonbridge\"—and Reuben grinned. David said no more, but for the rest of the day he seemed glum and abstracted. In the evening Reuben found him sitting at the corn accounts, staring through the open window into the dusk. \"Wot\u0027s fretting you, boy?\" he asked. \"Naun—I\u0027m thinking.\" Once or twice Reuben caught him in the same mood, and questioned him. But David still answered: \"I\u0027m thinking.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2094/59486.html","bookId":524,"book":{"id":524,"title":"Sussex Gorse The Story of a Fight","description":"简介： Boarzell Fair had been held every year on Boarzell Moor for as long as the oldest in Peasmarsh could remember.
