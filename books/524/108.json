{"id":21359,"no":108,"title":"Chapter 15","content":"Pete spent that evening with Ades, and Reuben\u0027s fireside slumbers were unrestful because he missed Pete\u0027s accustomed snore from the other end of the settle. The next morning his son did not appear, though there was plenty of work to be done in the hop-fields.[Pg 378] The young hops were now well above ground, and exposed to the perils of blight, so Reuben and Beatup were spraying them with insect-killer, badly in need of a third man to do the mixing. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Where\u0027s Pete?\" asked Reuben. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I dunno—?un\u0027t seen un this mornun. Ah—thur he be!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Where?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"C?aming up by the brook, surelye.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Reuben stared in amazement. The approaching figure undoubtedly was Pete, but a Pete so changed by circumstances and demeanour as to be almost unrecognisable. He wore his Sunday black clothes, which—as, with the exception of the funeral, he had not put them on for ten years—were something of a misfit. On his head was a black hat with a wide flapping brim, he walked with a measured step and his hands folded in front of him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well,\" cried Reuben, calling abuse to the rescue of surprise—\"you hemmed lazy good-fur-nothing, you!—wud all the Glotten hay to be cut, and ten acres o\u0027 hops to be sprayed, and you go laying in bed lik a lady, and then come out all dressed as if you wur going to church. Where\u0027s your corduroys?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"In my box—you can cl?athe the naked wud \u0027em—I\u0027m never going to put \u0027em on no more.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m hemmed if I\u0027ll have you working on my farm in that foolery. You\u0027ll m?ake us the laughing-stock of Peasmarsh. You\u0027ve got Ebenezer on the brain, you have, and you can justabout git it off again.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m never going to do another str?ake of wark on your farm as long as I live. Salvation\u0027s got me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Reuben dropped the insect-killer. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m the Lord\u0027s lost lamb,\" announced Pete. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The Lord\u0027s lost——!\" cried his father angrily. \"You t?ake off them blacks, and git to work lik a human being.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I tell you I\u0027m never going to work fur you ag?un. I\u0027m going forth to spread the Word. Salvation\u0027s got me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You wait till I git you, that\u0027s all,\" and Reuben ran at Pete. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Kip off, or I\u0027ll slosh you one on the boko,\" cried the Lord\u0027s lost lamb swinging up a vigorous pair of fists. Reuben breathed a sigh of relief. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There—I knew as there wur reason in you, Pete. You w?an\u0027t go and leave your f?ather lik the rest, all fur a hemmed Methody.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hemmed Methody! That\u0027s how you spik of the man wot\u0027s s?aved my soul. I tell you as there I wur lost in trespasses and sins, and now I\u0027m washed white as wool—there wur my evil doings sticking to my soul lik maggots to a dead rat, and now my soul\u0027s washed in the Blood of the Lamb, and I\u0027m going out to spread the Word.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Where are you going?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Unto the ends of the earth—Hastings. There\u0027s a friend of Ades there wot\u0027ll guide me into the Spirit\u0027s ways.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But you\u0027ll never leave me at the time of the hay-harvest, and Emily due to calve in another month?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I tell you I\u0027m shut of your farm—it\u0027s wot\u0027s led me astray from a lad. Instead of settin\u0027 and reading godly books and singing wud the saints I\u0027ve gone and ploughed furrers and carted manure; I\u0027ve thought only of the things of the flesh, I\u0027ve walked lik accursed Adam among the thistles. But now a Voice says, \u0027work no more!—go and spread the Word!\u0027 And if you\u0027re wise, f?ather, you\u0027ll c?ame too, and you, Beatup. You\u0027ll flee from the wrath to c?ame, when He shall sh?ake the earth and the elimunts shall dissolve in fervient heat, and He ...\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Have adone do wud your preaching. I\u0027m ashamed[Pg 380] of you, led astray by lunies as if you wur no better nor poor Harry. You\u0027re a hemmed lousy traitor, you are, the worst of \u0027em all.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m only fleeing from the wrath to c?ame—and if you\u0027re wise you\u0027ll foller me. This farm is the city of destruction, I tell you, it\u0027s a snare of the devil, it\u0027s Naboth\u0027s vineyard, it\u0027s the lake that burneth wud fire and brimstone. C?ame out of her, c?ame out of her, my peoples!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Reuben was paralysed. His jaw worked convulsively, and he looked at Pete as if he were a specially new and pestilential form of blight. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Save yourself, f?ather,\" continued the evangelist, \"and give up all the vain desires of the flesh. Is this a time to buy olive-yards and vineyards? Beware lest there c?ame upon you as it did to him wot purchaised a field, the reward of inquiety, and falling headlong he bust asunder in the midst and his bowels goshed out——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But Reuben had found his voice. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Git out of this!\" he shouted. \"I w?an\u0027t stand here and listen to you miscalling the farm wot\u0027s bred you and fed you over thirty year. Git out, and never think you\u0027ll come back again. I\u0027m shut of you. I d?an\u0027t want no more of you—I\u0027m out of the wood now, I\u0027ve got all the work out of you I\u0027ve needed, so you can go, and spread your hemmed Word, and be hemmed. I\u0027m shut of you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Pete fixed upon his father a gaze meant to inspire the utmost terrors of conscience, then turned on his heel and slowly walked away. \\n\\n \\n\\n The sight of his broad black back disappearing among the hop-bines was too much for Reuben. He picked up the can of insect-killer and hurled it after his son, splashing his respectability from head to foot with the stinking fluid. Pete flung round with his fists up, then suddenly dropped them and raised his eyes instead. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You wudn\u0027t daur do that if I hadn\u0027t been saved!\" he shouted. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then he walked off, beautiful of soul no doubt, but highly unpleasant of body. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2094/59480.html","bookId":524,"book":{"id":524,"title":"Sussex Gorse The Story of a Fight","description":"简介： Boarzell Fair had been held every year on Boarzell Moor for as long as the oldest in Peasmarsh could remember.
