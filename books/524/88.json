{"id":21339,"no":88,"title":"Chapter 20","content":"The roads outside Rye were dark with people. A procession was forming up at Rye Foreign, and another at the foot of Cadborough Hill. Outside the railway station a massed band played something rather like the Marseillaise, while the grass-grown, brine-smelling streets were spotted with stragglers, hurrying up from[Pg 308] all quarters, some carrying torches that flung shifting gleams on windows and gable-ends. \\n\\n \\n\\n Immense barrels of tar had been loaded on four waggons, to which four of the most prosperous farmers of the district had harnessed teams. Odiam was of course not represented, nor was Grandturzel, but three bell-ringing sorrels had come all the way from Kitchenhour, while the marsh farms of Leasan, the Loose, and Becket\u0027s House, accounted for the rest. \\n\\n \\n\\n The crowd surged round the waggons, cheered, joked, sang. The whole of Rye was there—prosperous tradesmen from the High Street or Station Road, innkeepers, farmers, shop-assistants, chains of fishermen in high boots, jerseys, and gold ear-rings, coast-guards from the Camber, and one or two scared-looking women clinging to stalwart arms. \\n\\n \\n\\n Rose shrank close to Handshut, though she did not take his arm. Sometimes the crowd would fling them together, so that they were close as in an embrace, at others they would stand almost apart, linked only by sidelong glances. The flare of a torch would suddenly slide over Handshut\u0027s face, showing her its dark gipsy profile, and she would turn away her eyes as from something too bright to bear. \\n\\n \\n\\n Every now and then the crowd would start singing inanely: \\n\\n \"Soles, plaice, and dabs, \\n\\n Rate, skate, and crabs. \\n\\n God save the Queen!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n It was like a muddled dream—people seemed to have no reason for what they did or shouted; they just ebbed and flowed, jostled and jambed, ran hither and thither, sang and laughed and swore. Rose looked round her to see if she could recognise anyone; now and then a face glowed on her in the torch-light, then died away, once she thought she saw the back of a tradesman\u0027s daughter whom she knew—but her chief feeling was of[Pg 309] an utter isolation with her loved one, as if he and she stood alone on some sea-pounded island against which the tides of the world roared in vain. \\n\\n \\n\\n At last the crowd began to move. The band had crushed through to the front of it, and was braying Rule Britannia up Playden Hill; then came the waggons, then the stout champions of freedom, singing at the pitch of their lungs: \\n\\n \"Soles, plaice, and dabs, \\n\\n Rate, skate, and crabs. \\n\\n God save the Queen!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The stars winked on the black zenith, while troubled winds sped and throbbed over the fields that huddled in mystery and silence on either side of the road—where noise and skirmish and darting lights, with the odours of warm human bodies, and the thudding and scrabbling of a thousand feet, proclaimed the People\u0027s holiday. \\n\\n \\n\\n They flowed through Playden like a torrent through an open sluice, sweeping up and carrying on all sorts of flotsam—villagers from cottage doors, ploughboys from the farms down by the Military Canal, gipsies from Iden Wood ... a mixed multitude, which the central mass absorbed, till all was one steaming and shouting blackness. \\n\\n \\n\\n The first gate was at Mockbeggar, where the road to Iden joins that which crosses the Marsh by Corkwood and Baron\u0027s Grange. In a minute it was off its hinges, and swealing in tar, while lusty arms pulled twigs, branches, even whole bushes out of the hedges to build its pyre. \\n\\n \\n\\n Rose shrank close to Handshut, so close that the clover scents of her laces were drowned in the smell of the cowhouse that came from his clothes. She found herself liking it, drinking in that soft, mixed, milky odour ... till a cloud of stifling tar-smoke swept suddenly over them, and she reeled against him suffocating, while all round them people choked and gasped and sneezed. \\n\\n \\n\\n The fire was lighted, a great crimson tongue screamed up in front of two motionless poplars, leaped as high as their tops, then spread fan-shaped, roaring. Men and women joined hands and danced round the blaze—in the distance, above the surging pack of heads, Rose could see them jumping and capering, with snatches of song that became screams every minute. \\n\\n \\n\\n The fire roared like a storm, and the wood crackled with sudden yelping reports. The dancing girls\u0027 hats flew off, their hair streamed wide, their skirts belled and swirled ... there was laughter and obscene remarks from the onlookers. Many from the rear pressed forward to join the dance, and those who were trampled on screamed or cursed, while one or two women fainted. Rose felt as if she would faint in the heat and reek of it all. She leaned heavily against Handshut and closed her eyes ... then she realised that his arm was round her. He held her against him, supporting her, while either she heard or thought she heard him say—\"D?an\u0027t be scared, liddle Rose—I\u0027m wud you. I w?an\u0027t let you fall.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She opened her eyes. The people were moving. The Mockbeggar gate had been accounted for, and they rolled on towards Thornsdale. The jamb was not so alarming, for a good many revellers had been left behind, dancing round the remains of the bonfire, crowding into the public-house, or scattering in couples over the fields. \\n\\n \\n\\n But though the jostling was no longer dangerous, Handshut still kept his arm about Rose, and held her close to his side. Now and then she made a feeble effort as if to free herself, but he held her fast, and she never put out her full strength. They walked as if in a dream, they two together, not speaking to anyone, not speaking to each other. Rose saw as if in a dream the Sign of Virgo hanging above Stone. The dipping of the lane showed the Kentish marshes down in the valley, with[Pg 311] the hills of Kent beyond them, twinkling with lights. The band lifted the strains of Hearts of Oak and Cheer, Boys, Cheer above the thud of marching feet, or occasionally drifted into sentiment with Love\u0027s Pilgrim—while every now and then, regardless of what was being played, two hundred throats would bray: \\n\\n \"Soles, plaice, and dabs, \\n\\n Rate, skate, and crabs. \\n\\n God save the Queen!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n It was about nine o\u0027clock when they came to Thornsdale, down on the Rother levels; the moon had risen and the marsh was smeethed in white. The air was thick with a strong-scented miasma, and beside the dykes long lines of willows faded into the mist. Here another orgy was started, in grotesque contrast with the pallid sleep of water. The gate that barred the Kent road was torn down, the bonfire prepared, the dance begun. \\n\\n \\n\\n The mists became patched with leaping shadows, and a dull crimson wove itself into the prevailing whiteness. Flaming twigs and sparks hissed into the dykes, rolls of acrid tar-smoke spread like a pall over the river and the Highnock Sewer, under which their waters were spotted with fire. The ground was soon pulped and poached with the jigging feet, and mud and water spurted into the dancers\u0027 faces. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was all rather ugly and ridiculous, and as before at Mockbeggar, the crowd began to straggle. This time there was no public-house to swallow up strays, but the marsh spread far and wide, a Land of Promise for lovers, who began to slink off two by two into the mists. Some who were not lovers formed themselves into noisy groups, and bumped about the lanes—waking the farmers\u0027 wives from Bosney to Marsh Quarter. \\n\\n \\n\\n Rose felt Handshut\u0027s arm clinging more tenderly about her, and she knew that he wanted to lead her[Pg 312] away from the noise and glare, to the coolness and loneliness of the waterside. She wanted to go—her head ached, her nostrils tingled, and her eyes were sore with the fumes of tar, her ears wearied with the din. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Let\u0027s go home,\" she said faintly—\"it\u0027s getting late.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We can go back by Corkwood across the marshes. It\u0027ll be quicker, and we shan\u0027t have no crowd spanneling round.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n They elbowed their way into the open, and soon the noise had died into a subdued roar, not so loud as the sigh of the reeds, while the bonfire showed only as a crimson stain on the eastward piling fogs. \\n\\n \\n\\n In time the contrast of silence grew quite painful. It ached. Only the sough of the wind in the reeds troubled it—the feet of Rose and Handshut were noiseless on the grass, they breathed inaudibly, only the breath of the watching night was heard. \\n\\n \\n\\n They skirted the Corkwood dyke, from which rose the stupefying, sodden, almost flavorous, smell of dying reeds—a waterfowl suddenly croaked among them, and another answered her with a wail from beyond Ethnam. The willows were shimmering silver dreams, bathed in the light of the moon which hung above the Fivewatering and had washed nearly all the stars out of the sky—only Sirius hung like a dim lamp over Great Knell, while Lyra was faint above Reedbed in the north. \\n\\n \\n\\n Rose walked half leaning against Handshut. She felt a very little feeble thing in the power of that great amorous night. The warm breath of the wind in her hair, the caress of moonlight on her eyes, the throbbing, miasmic, night-sweet scents of water and grass, the hush, the great sleep ... all tore at her heart, all weakened her with their huge soft strength, all crushed with their languors the poor resistance of her will. \\n\\n \\n\\n The tears began to roll down her cheeks, they shone on her face in the moonlight—they fell quite fast as she[Pg 313] walked on gripped against her lover\u0027s heart. She was leaning more and more heavily against him, for her strength was ebbing fast—oh, if he would only speak!—she could not walk much further, and yet she dared not rest beside him on that haunted ground. \\n\\n \\n\\n At last they came to where the high land rose out of the levels like a shore out of the sea, with a lick of road on it, winding up to Peasmarsh. It was here that Rose\u0027s uncertain strength failed her, she lurched against Handshut, and still encircled by his arms slid to the grass. \\n\\n \\n\\n They were in a huge meadow, sloping upwards to mysterious, night-wrapped hedges. The moonlight still trembled over the marsh, kindling sudden streaks of water, steeping fogs, silvering pollards and reeds. One could distinctly see the little houses on the Kent side of the Rother, Ethnam, and Lossenham, and Lambstand, some with lights blinking from them, others just black patches on the moon-grey country. Rose looked out towards them, and tried to picture in each a hearth beside which a husband and wife sat united ... then suddenly they were blotted out, as Handshut\u0027s face loomed dark between her and them, and his lips slowly fastened on her own. \\n\\n \\n\\n For a moment she yielded to the kiss, then suddenly tore herself away. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Rose ...\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Let me go—I can\u0027t.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Rose, why shud you pretend? You d?an\u0027t love the m?aster, and you do love me. Why shudn\u0027t we be happy together?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We—I can\u0027t.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why?—I love you, and you love me. Come away wud me—you shan\u0027t have a hard life——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"—It\u0027s not that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Wot is it then?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s—oh, I can\u0027t—I\u0027m his wife.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She pushed him from her as he tried to take her in his arms again, and stumbled to her feet. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s late—I—I must go home.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Rose, you queer me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He had risen too, and stood before her in mingled pain and surprise. He thought her resistance mere coyness, and suddenly flung his arms round her as she stood. \\n\\n \\n\\n She began to cry. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, no—don\u0027t be so cruel! Let me go!—I\u0027m his wife.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2094/59460.html","bookId":524,"book":{"id":524,"title":"Sussex Gorse The Story of a Fight","description":"简介： Boarzell Fair had been held every year on Boarzell Moor for as long as the oldest in Peasmarsh could remember.
