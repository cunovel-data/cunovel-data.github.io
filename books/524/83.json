{"id":21334,"no":83,"title":"Chapter 15","content":"One evening when Reuben was out inspecting a sick cow, Rose lay on the sofa languidly shelling peas. Once more it was June, and a rusty heat was outside blurring the orchard. Her fingers often lay idle in the bowl of peas, for though her task relieved the sweltering boredom which had weighed on her all day, every now and then a great lassitude would sweep over her, slacking her muscles, slacking her thoughts, till she drooped into a vague stagnation of sorrow. \\n\\n \\n\\n She felt horribly, uselessly tired, her gay spirits had trickled from her in sheer physical discomfort, and in her heart an insistent question writhed like a little flame. \\n\\n \\n\\n Two tears formed slowly in the corners of her eyes, welled at last over the silky, spidery lashes, and rolled down her cheeks. In themselves they were portents—for Rose hardly ever cried. More wonderful still, she did not know that she was crying, she merely became[Pg 292] stupidly conscious of a smudging of those motionless trees beyond the garden, and a washing of the hard, copper-coloured sky. \\n\\n \\n\\n She feebly put up her hand and brushed the veil away—already something strange had loomed through it, whipping her curiosity. A man was at the window, his head and shoulders dark against the sunset. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Handshut!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, ma\u0027am.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She frowned, for she seemed to catch a ring of mockery in the respectful words. She wondered if it had always been there. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Where\u0027s master?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"In the shed with Brindle.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And how is she?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I dunno—we\u0027ve sent for the veterinary.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n There was silence. Outside the flowers rustled in the slow hot breeze. The background of trees was growing dim, a web of shadow at the foot of the garden. \\n\\n \\n\\n Handshut still leaned on the sill, and she realised that if his words were decorous, his attitude was not. Surely he had something better to do than hang in at her window. Half his face was in shadow, half was reddened by the smouldering sky—it was the face of a young gipsy, brown, sullen, and mocking. She suddenly pulled herself into a sitting posture. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What are you staying for?—I reckon the master wants you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No—it\u0027s you that wants me, surelye.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The blood ebbed from her lips. She felt afraid, and yet glad. Then suddenly she realised what was happening and dragged herself back into dignity and anger. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes you do.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Kindly go at once, or I shall call someone.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Rose!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Once more she fell back into her state of terror and[Pg 293] delight. His coolness seemed to paralyse her—she could not act. She could only lie and watch him, trembling. Why had he changed so?—he, who had never faltered in his attitude of stiff respect under her most outrageous and flirtatious digs. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Rose,\" he said again, and his voice quivered as he said it, \"you do want me a liddle bit now.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What—what makes you think so?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He shrugged his shoulders—there must have been some foreign streak in his yokel\u0027s blood. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I d?an\u0027t think it—I know. A year agone you dudn\u0027t want me, so I kipt back, I wurn\u0027t a-going to m?ake you suffer. You wur frightened of that kiss....\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He had spoken it—her terror. \"Don\u0027t!\" she cried. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You wur frightened, so I saw you wurn\u0027t ready, and I tried to m?ake you feel as naun had happened.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, I thought you were a gentleman,\" she said with a sudden rap of anger. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I ?un\u0027t that. I\u0027m just a poor labouring man, wot loves you, and wot you love.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She tried to speak, but the words burnt up in her mouth. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And a labouring man you love\u0027s worth more than a m?aster you d?an\u0027t love, I reckon.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She shrank back on the sofa, folding her arms over her breast and gripping her shoulders. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You needn\u0027t look so frightened. I\u0027m only saying it. It w?an\u0027t m?ake no difference—unless you want it to.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How dare you speak to me like this?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Because I see you\u0027re justabout miserable, and I thought I\u0027d say as how I\u0027m beside you—only that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How—how d\u0027you know I\u0027m miserable?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Plain enough.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The sky had faded behind him and a crimson moon looked over his shoulder. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Plain enough,\" he repeated, \"but you needn\u0027t be[Pg 294] scared. I\u0027ll do naun you d?an\u0027t want; I\u0027ll come no nearer you than I am now—unless you call me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She burst into tears. \\n\\n \\n\\n He did not move. His head and shoulders were now nothing but a dark block against the purple and blue of the sky. The moon hung just above him like a copper dish. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"D?an\u0027t cry,\" he said slowly—\"I\u0027m only looking in at the window.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She struggled to her feet, sobs shaking and tearing her, and stumbled through the darkness to the door. Still sobbing she dragged herself upstairs, clinging to the rail, and every now and then stopping and bending double. Her loud sobs rang through the house, and soon the womenfolk were about her, questioning her, soothing her, and in the end putting her, still weeping, to bed. While outside in the barn Reuben watched in agony beside a sick cow. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2094/59455.html","bookId":524,"book":{"id":524,"title":"Sussex Gorse The Story of a Fight","description":"简介： Boarzell Fair had been held every year on Boarzell Moor for as long as the oldest in Peasmarsh could remember.
