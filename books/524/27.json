{"id":21278,"no":27,"title":"Chapter 9","content":"The Repeal of the Corn Laws did not have such a bad effect on Odiam as Reuben had feared. The harvests in \u002746 and \u002747 were unusually good, and a general revival of prosperity throughout the country atoned for the low price of grain. It was not to be expected, however, that he would forgive at once the party which had betrayed agricultural interests. He transferred his political allegiance to Disraeli, whose feudalistic attitude won his entire respect. It was a great trial to him that he could not read the newspapers, for nowadays he did not care to have Naomi read to him. She used to sometimes, but her utter lack of interest and understanding was no longer atoned for by a voice love-modulated or a soft hand stroking his. He resolved that none of his children should share his disabilities, and already the infant Albert toddled daily to a little house in the village where two vague-looking sisters taught the rising generation mysteries hidden from their parents. Reuben could spell out one or two words, and could write \"Reuben Backfield\" in big printing letters at the bottom of any document he had to sign, but he had no time to educate himself further. \\n\\n \\n\\n He was now twenty-seven, looking in some ways strangely older, in others far younger, than his age. The boy in him had not had much chance of surviving adolescence. Life had come down too hard on him. A grim struggle does not nourish youth, and mentally Reuben was ten or twelve years ahead of twenty-seven. His splendid health and strength, however, had maintained a physical boyishness, expressing itself in zeal and high spirits, a keen appetite, a boundless capacity for work, an undaunted enterprise. He was always hungry, he fell asleep directly his head touched the pillow, and slept like a child beside the tossing and wakeful Naomi. \\n\\n \\n\\n His work had made him splendid. His skin was the colour of the soil he tilled, a warm ruddy brown, his hair was black, growing low on the forehead, and curling slightly behind the ears. The moulding of his neck and jaw, his eyes, dark, bright, and not without laughter in them, his teeth, big, white, and pointed, like an animal\u0027s—all spoke of clean and vigorous manhood. He was now unmistakably a finer specimen than Harry. Harry had lost to a great measure his good looks. Not only had the vacancy of his face robbed it of much of its attraction—for more beautiful than shape or colouring or feature had been the free spirit that looked out of his eyes—but his constant habit of making hideous grimaces had worked it into lines, while the scar of his burning sometimes showed across his cheek. Add to this a stoop and a shambling gait, and it is no longer \"Beautiful Harry,\" nor even the ghost of him, so much as some changeling, some ill-done counterfeit image, set up by vindictive nature in his stead. \\n\\n \\n\\n Harry was no more his mother\u0027s favourite son. She was not the type of woman to whom a maimed child is dearer than half a dozen healthy ones. On the contrary he filled her with a vague terror and repulsion. She spoke to him gently, tended him carefully, even[Pg 102] sometimes forced herself to caress him—but for the most part she avoided him, feeling as she did so a vague shame and regret. \\n\\n \\n\\n On the other hand, her devotion to Reuben grew more and more absorbing and submissive. Her type was obviously the tyrant-loving, the more primitive kind, which worships the strong of the tribe and recoils instinctively from the weak. Where many a woman, perhaps rougher and harder than she, would have flung all the love and sweetness of her nature upon the blasted Harry, she turned instead to the strong, stalwart Reuben, who tyrannised over her and treated her with less and less consideration ... and this after twenty years of happy married life, during which she had idled and been waited on, and learned a hundred dainty ways. \\n\\n \\n\\n She had no patience with Naomi\u0027s simmering rebellion; she scoffed at her complaints, and always took Reuben\u0027s part against her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"As long as there\u0027s men and women in the world, the men \u0027ull be top and the women bottom.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why?\" asked Naomi. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Because it wur meant so. If we\u0027d bin meant fur masters d\u0027you think we\u0027d have bin made so liddle and dentical like?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But we\u0027re a sight smarter than men.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes—that makes up to us a bit, but it d?an\u0027t do us any real good ... only helps us git round a man sometimes when we can\u0027t git over him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then it does us some good after all. A sad state we\u0027d be in if the men always had their own way.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You take it from me that it\u0027s much better when a man has his own way than when he hasn\u0027t. Then he\u0027s pleased wud you and makes life warm and easy for you. It\u0027s women as are always going against men wot are unhappy. Please men and they\u0027ll be good to you and you\u0027ll be happy, d?an\u0027t please them and they\u0027ll be bad to you and you\u0027ll be miserable. But women who\u0027re for[Pg 103] ever grumbling, and making a fuss about doing wot they\u0027ve got to do whether they like it or not, and are cross-grained wives, and unwilling mothers ...\" and so on, and so on. \\n\\n \\n\\n Yet Mrs. Backfield did not, any more than Naomi, understand Reuben\u0027s great ambition. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2094/59399.html","bookId":524,"book":{"id":524,"title":"Sussex Gorse The Story of a Fight","description":"简介： Boarzell Fair had been held every year on Boarzell Moor for as long as the oldest in Peasmarsh could remember.
