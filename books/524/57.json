{"id":21308,"no":57,"title":"Chapter 4","content":"The girls cried a great deal at their grandmother\u0027s death—she had never taken up enough room in the boys\u0027 lives for them to miss her much. As for Reuben,[Pg 203] though he had been fond of her, he could not sincerely regret her, since for the last few months she had, so to speak, been carried on entirely at a loss. \\n\\n \\n\\n He needed every penny and every minute more desperately than ever, for Grandturzel ran Odiam closer and closer in the race. Realf now plainly saw how matters stood. As yet there was no open breach between him and Reuben—when one of them came into the public-house the other always waited a decent interval before clearing out—but if there was no open breach, there was open rivalry. All the neighbourhood knew of it, and many a bet was made. \\n\\n \\n\\n The odds were generally on Reuben. It was felt that a certain unscrupulousness was necessary to the job, and in that Backfield had the advantage. \"Young Realf wudn\u0027t hurt a fly,\" his champions had to acknowledge. Though the money was with Reuben, the sympathy was mostly with Realf, for the former\u0027s dealings had scarcely made him popular. He was a hard man to his customers, he never let them owe him for grain or roots or fodder; his farm-hands, when drunk, spoke of him as a monster, and a not very tender-hearted peasantry worked itself sentimental over his treatment of his children. \\n\\n \\n\\n For some months the antagonism between Odiam and Grandturzel remained in this polite state, most of the fighting being done by their champions. The landlord of the Cocks grew quite tired of chucking out Odiamites and Grandturzelites who could not, like their leaders, confine their war to words. But it only wanted some cause, however trivial, to make the principals show their fists. The time that Reuben would stay in the bar after Realf had entered it grew shorter and shorter, and his pretexts for leaving more and more flimsy. Realf himself, though a genial, good-tempered young man, could not help resenting the scorn with which he was treated. He once told Ginner that Backfield was an uncivilised[Pg 204] brute, and Ginner took care to forward this remark to the proper quarter. \\n\\n \\n\\n At last the gods, who are more open-handed than ungrateful people suppose, took pity on the rivals, and gave them something to fight about. The pretext was in itself trivial, but when the gunpowder is laid nothing bigger than a match is needed. This particular pretext was a barrow of roots which had been ordered from Kitchenhour by Reuben and sent by mistake to Grandturzel. Realf\u0027s shepherd, not seeing any cause for doubt, gave the roots as winter fodder to his ewes, and said nothing about them. When Reuben tramped over to Kitchenhour and asked furiously why his roots had never been sent, the mistake was discovered. He came home by Grandturzel, and found his precious roots, all thrown out on the fields, being nibbled by Realf\u0027s ewes. \\n\\n \\n\\n Realf himself was away, but Reuben left such a stinging message for him, that apology was impossible except in a form that could only be regarded as a fresh insult. An apology in this shape reached Odiam at dinner-time, and Reuben at once sent off Beatup with an acceptance of it that was very nearly obscene. The result was that Realf himself arrived about three o\u0027clock furiously demanding an explanation of his neighbour\u0027s insulting conduct. \\n\\n \\n\\n The two men met in the kitchen, Peter backing up his father, and for a long time the scene was stormy, the word \"roots\" whirling about the conversation, with the prefix \"my good\" or \"your hemmed\" as the case might be. Realf was genuinely angry—Reuben\u0027s attitude of mingled truculence and scorn had wounded even his easy pride. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027re justabout afeard of me, that\u0027s wot you are. You think I\u0027ll bust up your old farm and show myself a better man than you. You\u0027re afeard of me because I\u0027m a younger man than you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ho, afeard of you, am I?—and because you\u0027re a[Pg 205] youngster? I\u0027ll justabout show you wot a youngster\u0027s worth. A better man, are you?—Put up your fists, and we\u0027ll see who\u0027s the better man.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Reuben began to take off his coat—young Realf drew back almost in disgust. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m not going to fight a man old enough to be my father,\" he said, flushing. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ho, ?un\u0027t you?—Come on, you puppy-dog, and see fur yourself if you need t?ake pity on my old age.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He had flung off his coat, and squared up to Realf, who, seeing no alternative, began to strip. \\n\\n \\n\\n Peter interposed: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Let me t?ake him on, f?ather. I\u0027ll show him a thing or two.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Reuben turned on him savagely. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Stand clear!—who wants your tricks? I\u0027m going to show him wot a man\u0027s worth—a man wot\u0027s had his beard longer than this puppy\u0027s bin in the warld.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But you\u0027re out of training.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m in training enough to whip boys. Stand clear!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Pete stood clear, as the two combatants closed. Neither knew much of the game. Realf had been born too late for boxing to have been considered a necessary part of his education, and Reuben had been taught in an old school—the school of Bendigo and Deaf Burke—mighty bashers, who put their confidence in their strength, despised finesse, and counted their victories in pints of blood. \\n\\n \\n\\n He fairly beat down on Realf, who was lithe enough generally to avoid him, but not experienced enough to do so as often as he might. Every time Reuben struck him, the floor seemed to rush up to his eyes, and the walls to sag, and the house to fill with smoke. Pete danced round them silently, for while his sympathies were with his father his sporting instincts bade him keep outwardly impartial. He was disgusted with their footwork, indeed their whole style outraged his bruising[Pg 206] ideals; but it pleased him to see how much Reuben was the better man. \\n\\n \\n\\n They hardly ever clinched—on the other hand, there was much plunging and rushing. Reuben brought down Realf three times and Realf brought down Reuben once. It was noticeable that if the younger man fell more easily he also picked himself up more quickly. Between the rounds they leaned exhausted against the wall, Pete prowling about between them, longing to take his father on his knee, but still resolved to see fair play. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was not likely that the fight would be a long one, for both combatants were already winded. Realf, moreover, was bleeding from the nose, and Reuben\u0027s left eye was swollen. Once he caught a hit flush on the mouth which cut his nether lip in two, and, owing to his bad footwork, brought him down. But he was winning all the same. \\n\\n \\n\\n For once that Realf managed to land a blow, Reuben landed a couple, and with twice as much weight behind them. The younger man soon began to look green and sick, he staggered about, and flipped, while the sweat poured off his forehead into his eyes. Reuben breathed stertorously and could scarcely see out of his left eye, but was otherwise game. Pete felt prouder of him than ever. \\n\\n \\n\\n Suddenly Backfield\u0027s fist crashed into Realf\u0027s body, full on the mark. The wind rushed out of him as out of a bellows, and he doubled up like a screen. This time he made no effort to rise; he lay motionless, one arm thrown out stiff and jointless as a bough, while a little blood-flecked foam oozed from between his teeth. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027ve done it!\" cried Pete. \\n\\n \\n\\n Reuben had flopped down in a heap on the settle, and his son ran off for help. He flung open the door, and nearly fell over Tilly who was cowering behind it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2094/59429.html","bookId":524,"book":{"id":524,"title":"Sussex Gorse The Story of a Fight","description":"简介： Boarzell Fair had been held every year on Boarzell Moor for as long as the oldest in Peasmarsh could remember.
