{"id":21269,"no":18,"title":"Chapter 14","content":"From thenceforward there was no looking back. Preparations for the wedding began at once. Old Gasson was delighted, and dowered his girl generously. As for Naomi, she gave herself up to the joys of bride-elect. Her position as Reuben\u0027s betrothed was much more important than as Harry\u0027s. It was more definite, more exalted, the ultimate marriage loomed more largely and more closely in it. She and Reuben were not so much sweethearts as husband and wife to be. Their present semi-attached state scarcely counted, it was just an unavoidable interval of preparation for a more definite relationship. \\n\\n \\n\\n She was glad in a way that everything was so different, glad that Reuben\u0027s love-making was so utterly unlike Harry\u0027s. Otherwise she could never have plunged herself so deep into forgetfulness. She was quite without regrets—she could never have imagined she could be so free of them. She lived for the present, and for the future which was not her own. She was at rest. No longer the pursuing feet came after her, making her life a nightmare of long flights—she was safe in her captor\u0027s grasp, borne homeward on his shoulder. \\n\\n \\n\\n She was not exaltedly happy or wildly expectant. Her anticipations were mostly material, buyings and stitchings. She looked forward to her position as mistress of Odiam, and stocked her linen cupboard. As for Reuben, her attitude towards him had changed at once with surrender. If he no longer terrified, also he no longer thrilled. She had grown fond of him, peacefully and domestically so, in a way she could never have been fond of Harry. She loved to feel his strong arm round her, his shoulder under her head, she loved to nestle close up to him and feel his warmth. His kisses were very different from Harry\u0027s, more lingering, more passionate, but, paradoxically, they thrilled her less. There had always been a touch of the wild and elfin in Harry\u0027s love-making which suggested an adventure in fairyland, whereas Reuben\u0027s suggested nothing but earth, and the earth is not exciting to those who have been in faery. \\n\\n \\n\\n At last the wedding-day came—an afternoon in May, gloriously white and blue. Naomi stood before her mirror with delicious qualms, while one or two girl friends took the place of her mother and helped her to dress. She wore white silk, very full in the skirt, with a bunch of lilies of the valley in the folds of the bodice, which was cut low, showing the soft neck that in contrast to the dead white of the silk had taken a delicious creamy cowslip tint. Her lovable white hat was trimmed with artificial lilies of the valley, and she had white kid gloves and tiny white kid shoes. \\n\\n \\n\\n She was very happy, and if she thought of Harry and what might have been, it only brought a delightful sad-smiling melancholy over her happiness like a bridal veil. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How do I look?\" she asked her friends. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You look charming!\"—\"how well your hat becomes you!\"—\"how small your feet seem in your new shoes!\"—\"how sweet you smell!\"—chorused[Pg 73] the girls, loving her more than ever because they envied her, after the manner of girls. \\n\\n \\n\\n Naomi walked to church on her father\u0027s arm. She held her head down, and her bridesmaids saw her neck grow pink below the golden fluff on the nape. She hid her face from Reuben and would not look at him as they stood side by side before Rye altar. No one could hear her responses, they were spoken so faintly, she was the typical Victorian bride, all shy, trembling, and blushing. \\n\\n \\n\\n Only once she dared look up, and that was when they were walking solemnly from the communion table to the vestry—then she suddenly looked up and saw Reuben\u0027s great strong shoulder towering above her own, his face rather flushed under its sunburn, and his hair unusually sleek and shining with some oil. \\n\\n \\n\\n They did not speak to each other till he had her in his gig, driving up Playden Hill. Then he muttered—\"Liddle Naomi—my wife,\" and kissed her on the neck and lips. She did not want him to kiss her, because she wished to avoid crumpling her gown, and also she was afraid Reuben\u0027s horse might choose that moment to kick or run away. But of course such reasons did not appeal to him, and it was a dishevelled and rather cross little bride whom he lifted out at Odiam. \\n\\n \\n\\n The wedding supper was to be held at the bridegroom\u0027s house, as old Gasson\u0027s rooms were not large enough, and he objected to \"having the place messed up.\" During the marriage service Mrs. Backfield had been worrying about her pie-crusts—indeed she almost wished she had stayed at home. Naomi helped her dish up the supper, while Reuben received the guests who were beginning to arrive, some from Rye, some from the neighbouring farms. There had been a certain amount of disgusted comment when it became known that Backfield was marrying his brother\u0027s sweetheart; but criticism of[Pg 74] Reuben always ended in reluctant admiration for his smartness as a business man. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He\u0027ll go far, that young feller,\" said Realf of Grandturzel. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Where\u0027s Harry?\" Vennal asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sh-sh—d?an\u0027t you go asking ork\u0027ard questions.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They w?an\u0027t have him to fiddle, I reckon,\" said Realf. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I shud say even young Ben wudn\u0027t do that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why not?\" put in Ditch—\"he d?an\u0027t know naun about it. He\u0027s forgotten she ever wur his girl.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You can\u0027t be sure o\u0027 that, Mus\u0027 Ditch—only the Lard knows wot mad folkses remember and wot they forget. But there\u0027s the supper ready; git moving or we\u0027ll have to sit by the door.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Odiam\u0027s strict rule had been relaxed in honour of the wedding, and a lavish, not to say luxurious, meal covered two long tables laid end to end across the kitchen. There was beef and mutton, there was stew, there were apple and gooseberry pies, and a few cone-shaped puddings, pink and white and brown, giving an aristocratic finish to the supper. \\n\\n \\n\\n Naomi and Reuben sat at the head of the table, Mr. Gasson and Mrs. Backfield on either side of them. Harry was not present, for his methods of feeding made him rather a disgusting object at meals. Naomi had put herself tidy, but somehow she still felt disordered and flustered. She hated all this materialism encroaching on her romance. The sight of the farmers pushing for places at the table filled her with disgust—the slightest things upset her, the untidy appearance of the dishes after they had been helped, some beer stains on the cloth, even her husband\u0027s hearty appetite and not quite noiseless eating. The room soon became insufferably hot, and she felt herself getting damp and sticky—a most unlovely condition for a bride. \\n\\n \\n\\n When the actual feeding was over there were speeches[Pg 75] and toasts. Vennal of Burntbarns proposed the health of the bride, and Realf of Grandturzel that of the groom. Then Mrs. Backfield\u0027s health was drunk, then Mr. Gasson\u0027s. There were more toasts, and some songs—\"Oh, no, I never mention her,\" \"The Sussex Whistling Song,\" and old farmhouse ballads, such as: \\n\\n \"Our maid she would a hunting go, \\n\\n She\u0027d never a horse to ride; \\n\\n She mounted on her master\u0027s boar, \\n\\n And spurred him on the side. \\n\\n Chink! chink! chink! the bridle went, \\n\\n As she rode o\u0027er the downs. \\n\\n So here\u0027s unto our maiden\u0027s health, \\n\\n Drink round, my boys! drink round!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Naomi felt bored and sick; twice she yawned, and she stretched her tired shoulders under her dress. At last Reuben noticed her discomfort. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027re tired—you\u0027d better go to bed,\" he whispered, and she at once gladly rose and slipped away, though she would not have gone without his suggestion. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Can I help you, dear?\" asked Mrs. Backfield as she passed her chair. But Naomi wanted to be alone. \\n\\n \\n\\n She stole out of the kitchen into the peace of the dark house, ran up the stairs, and found the right door in the unlighted passage. The bedroom was very big and cold, and on the threshold she wrinkled up her nose at a strange scent, something like hay and dry flowers. \\n\\n \\n\\n She groped her way to the chimney-piece and found a candle and a tinder-box. The next minute a tiny throbbing flame fought unsuccessfully with the darkness which still massed in the corners and among the cumbrous bits of furniture. Naomi\u0027s new kid shoes were hurting her, and she bent down to untie them; but even as she bent, her eyes were growing used to the dim light, and she noticed something queer about the room. She lifted her head and saw that the outlines of the[Pg 76] dressing-table and bed were rough ... the scent of dry grass suddenly revolted her. \\n\\n \\n\\n She looked round, and this time she saw clearly. About the mirror, along the bed-head, and garlanding the posts, were crude twists and lumps of field flowers—dandelions buttercups, moon daisies, oxlips, fennel, and cow-parsley, all bunched up with hay grass, all dry, withered, rotting, and malodorous. There was a great sheaf of them on her pillow, an armful torn up from a hay-field, still smelling of the sun that had blasted it.... \\n\\n \\n\\n In a flash Naomi knew who had put them there. No sane mind could have conceived such a decoration or seeing eyes directed it. Harry, exiled from church and feast, had spent his time in a crazy effort to honour the happy pair. He knew she was to marry Reuben, but had not seemed to take much interest. Doubtless the general atmosphere of festivity and adornment had urged him to this. \\n\\n \\n\\n How dreadful! Already she saw an insect crawling over the bed—probably there were lots of others about the room; and these flowers, all parched, dead, and evil-smelling, gave a sinister touch to her wedding day. A lump rose in her throat, the back of her eyes was seared by something hot and sudden.... Oh, Harry ... Harry.... \\n\\n \\n\\n Then misery turned to rage. It was Reuben who had brought her to this, who had stolen her from Harry, forced her into marrying him, and exposed her to this anguish. She hated Reuben. She hated him. With all the fierceness of her conquered soul and yielded body she hated him. She would have nothing more to do with him, she would be revenged on him, punish him ... a little hoarse scream of rage burst from her lips, and she turned suddenly and ran out of that dreadful room. \\n\\n \\n\\n She ran down the passage, panting and sobbing with rage. Then at the stair head something even blacker[Pg 77] than the darkness met her. It seized her, it swung her up, she was powerless as a little bird in its grasp. Her struggles were crushed in the kind strong arms that held her, and rage was stifled from her lips with kisses. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2094/59390.html","bookId":524,"book":{"id":524,"title":"Sussex Gorse The Story of a Fight","description":"简介： Boarzell Fair had been held every year on Boarzell Moor for as long as the oldest in Peasmarsh could remember.
