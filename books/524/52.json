{"id":21303,"no":52,"title":"Chapter 20","content":"On reaching Odiam, Reuben did not go into the kitchen where his children were gathered, expectant and curious. He went straight upstairs. Caro, who caught a glimpse of him in the passage, ran away in terror—he looked so dreadful, his face all dabbled with blood and yolk of egg. \\n\\n \\n\\n He went up to Albert\u0027s room. He had furiously given Ditch the lie in the Courthouse, but he had never trusted his son, and the accusation had poured over him a flood of shame which could be quelled only by its proof or its refutation. If Albert\u0027s guilt were proved—which Reuben, now bathing in this luminous shame, saw was quite probable—then he knew what to do to clean the smirch off Odiam; if, on the other hand, his innocence were established, then he would punish those swine who threw mud at him and his farm. \\n\\n \\n\\n Albert slept in one of the attics with Jemmy and Pete. Reuben had no intention of meeting him till he had something to confront him with, for he was pretty sure that the boy would lie to him. He began turning the room topsy-turvy, and had soon found in a drawer a[Pg 186] heap of papers scrawled over with writing. It was unlucky that he could not read, for he could not even tell whether the handwriting were Albert\u0027s—these might be some letters he had received. Suddenly, however, a word caught his eye which he had seen a hundred times on hoardings, letters, bills, and other documents—MacKinnon. He could trace it out quite clearly. What had Albert to do with MacKinnon? Reuben clenched the papers together in his fist, and went downstairs to the kitchen. \\n\\n \\n\\n Albert was not there. All the better! Reuben strode up to Tilly, unaware of how terrible he looked with the traces of his battle not yet washed from his face, and banged the papers down in front of her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Wot\u0027s all this?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Tilly was frightened. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s—it\u0027s only poetry, f?ather.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Read me some of it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s only Albert\u0027s.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s why I want to hear wot it\u0027s about. You read it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Tilly began to read in a faltering voice: \\n\\n \"If you\u0027d know what the Colonel is, pray travel over \\n\\n The Sluice at Scott\u0027s Float—and then drive on to Dover— \\n\\n You\u0027ll find yourself quickly brought up by a Gate....\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Reuben struck his fist on the table, and she dropped the paper with a little cry. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s true, then! Oh Lard! it\u0027s true!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Wot, f?ather?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Them\u0027s Albert\u0027s verses right enough?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, f?ather, but——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Fetch him here.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Tilly was more frightened than ever. She had never heard anything about the great Gate controversy, and could not understand why Reuben was so angry with Albert. The verses seemed to her quite harmless, they[Pg 187] were not even about love. However, she could not disobey her father, so she ran and fetched Albert out of the corn-chamber, begging him to be careful what he said, \"fur f?ather\u0027s unaccountable vrothered to-night about something.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How did the Election go?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I never asked.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, you gals! Well, I expect that\u0027s wot\u0027s the matter. The Liberal\u0027s got in.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But why should that m?ake f?ather angry wud you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Albert stuck out his chest and looked important, as he invariably did before an encounter with Reuben, in spite of the fact that these always ended most ingloriously as far as he was concerned. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He\u0027s bin reading some poetry of yours, Bertie,\" continued his sister, \"and he\u0027s justabout dreadful, all his cl?athes tore about, and a nasty mess of blood and yaller stuff on his face.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Albert suddenly began to look uneasy. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh Lard! perhaps I\u0027d better bolt fur it.—No, I\u0027ll square him out. You\u0027ll stand by me, Tilly?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, but d?an\u0027t m?ake him angry—he might beat you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Bertie\u0027s pride was wounded by this suggestion, which was, however, soundly based on precedent, and he entered the kitchen with something very like a swagger. \\n\\n \\n\\n Reuben was standing by the table, erect, and somehow dignified in spite of the mess he was in. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well,\" he said slowly, \"well—MacKinnon\u0027s hound!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Albert saw the heap of scribbled paper on the table, and blenched. \\n\\n \\n\\n Reuben walked up to him, took him by the shoulders, and shook him as a dog might shake a rabbit. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You hemmed, scummy, lousy Radical!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Albert could not speak, for he felt as if his brains and teeth were rattling about inside his head. The rest of[Pg 188] the family hunched together by the door, the boys gaping idiotically, the girls in tears. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, wot\u0027ve you got to say fur yourself before I kick you round the table?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll write wot I please, surelye,\" growled Albert, trying rather unsuccessfully to resume his swagger. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, will you! Well, there\u0027ll be naun to prevent you when you\u0027re out of this house—and out you go to-night; I\u0027ll have no Radical hogs on my farm. I\u0027m shut of you!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"F?ather!\" cried Tilly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hold your tongue! Does anyone here think I\u0027m going to have a Radical fur my son?—and a tedious lying traitor, too, wot helps his f?ather\u0027s enemies, and busts up the purtiest election that wur ever fought at Rye. Do you say you didn\u0027t write those lousy verses wot have lost us everything?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No—I d?an\u0027t say it. I did write \u0027em. But it\u0027s all your fault that I did—so you\u0027ve no right to miscall me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My fault!\"—Reuben\u0027s jaw dropped as he faced the upstart. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes. You\u0027ve allus treated me lik a dog, and laughed at my writing and all I wanted to do. Then chaps came along as didn\u0027t laugh, and promised me all sorts o\u0027 things if I\u0027d write fur them.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Wot sort o\u0027 things?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mr. Hedges, the Liberal agent, promised that if I\u0027d write fur him, he\u0027d git me work on a London paper, and I could m?ake my fortune and be free of all this.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All wot?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Odiam!\" shrieked Albert. \\n\\n \\n\\n Reuben faced him with straight lips and dilated nostrils; the boy was now quivering with passion, hatred seemed to have purged him of terror. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes—Odiam!\" he continued, clenching his fists—\"that blasted farm of yourn wot\u0027s the curse of us all. Here we\u0027re made to work, and never given a penny fur[Pg 189] our labour—we\u0027re treated worse than the lowest farm-hands, like dogs, we are. Robert stole money to git away, and can you wonder that when I see my chance I should t?ake it. I\u0027m no Radical—I d?an\u0027t care one way or t\u0027other—but when the Radicals offered me money to write verses fur \u0027em, I wurn\u0027t going to say \u0027no.\u0027 They promised to m?ake my fortun, and save me from you and your old farm, which I wish was in hell.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Stop your ranting and tell me how the hogs got you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I met Mr. Hedges at the pub——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Wur it you or him wot thought of the Scott\u0027s Float G?ate?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I heard of it from old Pitcher down at Loose, and I t?ald Hedges. I justabout——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A terrific blow from Reuben cut him short. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2094/59424.html","bookId":524,"book":{"id":524,"title":"Sussex Gorse The Story of a Fight","description":"简介： Boarzell Fair had been held every year on Boarzell Moor for as long as the oldest in Peasmarsh could remember.
