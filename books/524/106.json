{"id":21357,"no":106,"title":"Chapter 13","content":"That was how the Rev. Roger Ades started his ministrations at Odiam. At first Reuben was disgusted. He had never before had truck with Dissenters, whom he considered low-class and unfit for anyone above a tenant farmer. He was outraged by the thought of the pastor\u0027s almost daily visits, accompanied by loud singing of hymns in Albert\u0027s bedroom. However, he did not actually forbid him the house, for Pete had brought him there, and Reuben never treated Pete exactly as he treated his other sons. Pete was the only member of his family who had so far not disgraced Odiam—except the two little boys, who were too young—and he was always careful to do nothing that might unsettle him and drive him into his brother\u0027s treacherous ways.[Pg 373] So the pastor of Ebenezer came unchecked, and doubtless his ministrations were appreciated, for as time went by the intervals between them grew shorter and shorter, till at last Mr. Ades was more often in the house than out of it. Though strengthened in soul, Albert grew weaker in body, and Pete began to scamp his farm work. Even when the minister was present, he would not leave his brother. It grieved Reuben that, while outside matters prospered, indoors they should remind him of a Methodist conventicle. The house was full of hymns, they burst through the close-shut windows of Albert\u0027s bedroom and assaulted the ears of workers on Boarzell. In the evenings, when Ades was gone, Pete whistled them about the house. Reuben was ashamed; it made him blush to think that his stout churchmanship should have to put up with this. \"I scarcely dare show my face in the pub, wud all this going on at h?ame,\" he remarked sorrowfully. Meanwhile, the farm was doing well; indeed, it was almost back at its former glory. Having laid the foundations, Reuben could now think of expansion, and he engaged two more farm-hands. He had quite changed the look of Boarzell. Instead of the swell and tumble of the heather, were now long stretches of chocolate furrows, where only the hedge mustard sometimes sprang mutinously, soon to be rooted up. Reuben, however, looked less on these than on the territories still unconquered. He would put his head on one side and contemplate the Moor from different angles, trying to size the rough patch at the top. He wondered how long it would be before it could all be his. He would have to work like a fiend if he was to do it in his lifetime. There was the Grandturzel inclosure, too.... Then he would go and whip up his men, and make them work nearly as hard as he worked himself, so that in the evening they would complain at the Cocks of[Pg 374] \"wot a tedious hard m?aster Mus\u0027 Backfield wur, surelye!\" One day Albert sent his father a message through Pete. \"He wanted me to tell you wot an unaccountable difference he sees in Boarzell now he\u0027s come back. He\u0027d never have known it, \u0027tis so changed. All the new bit towards Doozes is justabout pr?aper.\" Reuben said nothing, in spite of the entreaty in Pete\u0027s honest eyes, but his heart warmed towards his son. Albert had shown at last proper spirit; he had no doubt realised his baseness, and acknowledged that he had been a fool and villain to betray Odiam. Now he saw how mightily the farm prospered in spite of adversity, he praised its greatness, and no man could praise Odiam without winning a little of Reuben\u0027s goodwill. He softened towards the prodigal, and felt that he would like to see the boy—he still called him \"the boy,\" though he was thirty-seven—and if he behaved penitently and humbly, forgive him before he died. That evening he went up to Pete\u0027s room. The sound of voices came from it, one exceedingly loud, and it struck Reuben that \"that hemmed Methody\" was there. He opened the door and looked in. Albert lay propped up in the bed, his hands, wasted into claws, clasped in the attitude of prayer, his eyes protruding strangely above his sunken cheeks, where the skin was stretched on the bones. Pete knelt beside him, his eyes closed, his hands folded, like a child saying its prayers, and at the foot of the bed stood the Rev. Roger Ades, his face contorted with fervour, his arms waving in attitudes that were reminiscent of the boxing ring in spite of his efforts. None of them saw or heard Reuben\u0027s entrance, and at that moment they all burst into a hymn: \"There\u0027s life in the crimson Fountain, There\u0027s peace in the Blood of the Slain.\" A long shudder of disgust went over Reuben\u0027s flesh. He was utterly shocked by what he saw. That such things could go on in his house struck him with horror, tinctured by shame. He went out, shutting the door noisily behind him—the softer feelings had gone; instead he felt bitterly and furiously humiliated. The hymn faltered and stopped when the door banged, but the next moment the minister caught it up again, and hurled it after Reuben\u0027s indignant retreat: \"My soul is all washed to whiteness, And I\u0027ll never be foul again. Salvation! Salvation full and free!\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2094/59478.html","bookId":524,"book":{"id":524,"title":"Sussex Gorse The Story of a Fight","description":"简介： Boarzell Fair had been held every year on Boarzell Moor for as long as the oldest in Peasmarsh could remember.
