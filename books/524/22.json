{"id":21273,"no":22,"title":"Chapter 4","content":"That summer Naomi realised that she was going to have another child. She was sorry, for her maternal instincts were satisfied for the present, and she had begun to value her new-returned health. It would be hard to have to go back to bondage again. However, there was no help for it. Reuben was overjoyed, and once more she slipped under his tyranny. This time she found it irksome, his watchfulness was a nuisance, his anxiety was absurd. However, she did not complain. She was too timid, and too fond of him. \"I hope it\u0027ll be a girl this time,\" she said one afternoon, when according to custom she was walking along Totease Lane, his arm under hers. \"A girl—— Oh, no! I want another boy.\" \"But we\u0027ve got a boy, Reuben. It would be nice to have a girl now.\" \"Why, liddle creature?\" \"Oh, I justabout love baby girls. They\u0027re so sweet—and all their dresses and that.... Besides we don\u0027t want two boys.\" To her surprise Reuben stopped in the road, and burst out laughing. \"Two boys!—not want two boys!—Why, we want ten boys! if I cud have twenty, I shudn\u0027t grumble.\" \"What nonsense you\u0027re talking, Backfield,\" said Naomi primly. \"I ?un\u0027t talking nonsense, I\u0027m talking sound sense. How am I to run the farm wudout boys? I want boys to help me work all that land. I\u0027m going to have the whole of Boarzell, as I\u0027ve told you a dunnamany times, and I\u0027ll want men wud me on it. So d?an\u0027t you go talking o\u0027 girls. Wot use are girls?—none! They just spannel about, and then go off and get married.\" \"But a girl \u0027ud be useful in the house—she could help mother when she\u0027s older.\" \"No, thankee. However hard she works she ?un\u0027t worth half a boy. You give me ten boys, missus, and then I d?an\u0027t mind you having a girl or so to please yourself.\" Naomi was disgusted. Reuben had once or twice offended her by his coarseness, but she could never get used to it. \"Oh, how can you speak to me so!\" she gulped. \"Now, you silly liddle thing, wot are you crying for? Mayn\u0027t I have a joke?\" \"But you\u0027re so vulgar!\" Reuben looked a little blank. None of the details of his great desire had hitherto struck him as vulgar. \"Vulgar, am I?\" he said ruefully. \"No matter, child, we w?an\u0027t go quarrelling. Come, dry your dear eyes, and maybe to-morrow I\u0027ll drive you over to Rye to see the market.\" Naomi obediently dried her eyes, but it was rather hard to keep them from getting wet again. For in her heart she knew that it was not the vulgarity of Reuben\u0027s joke which had upset her, but a certain horrible convincingness about it. It was not so merely a joke as he would have her think. During the days that followed her attitude towards him changed subtly, almost subconsciously. A strange fear of him came over her. Would he insist on her bearing child after child to help him realise his great ambition? It was ridiculous, she knew, and probably due to her state of health, but sometimes she found herself thinking of him not so much as a man as a thing; she saw in him no longer the loving if tyrannical husband, but a law, a force, to which she and everyone else must bow. She even noticed a kind of likeness between him and Boarzell—swart, strong, cruel, full of an irrepressible life.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2094/59394.html","bookId":524,"book":{"id":524,"title":"Sussex Gorse The Story of a Fight","description":"简介： Boarzell Fair had been held every year on Boarzell Moor for as long as the oldest in Peasmarsh could remember.
