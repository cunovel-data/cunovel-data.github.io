{"id":21262,"no":11,"title":"Chapter 7","content":"That night Reuben came to supper as hungry as a wolf. He was in a fine good humour, for his body, pleasantly tired, glowing, aching, tickled with the smell of food, was giving him a dozen agreeable sensations. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Got some splendid fire-wood fur you, mother,\" he said after a few minutes\u0027 silence enforced by eating. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And wot about the rootses?\" asked Harry, \"wull you be digging those out to-morrer? It\u0027ll be an unaccountable tough job.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, I\u0027ve found a way of gitting shut of them rootses—thought of it while I wur working at the trees. I\u0027m going to blast \u0027em out.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Blast \u0027em!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes. Blast \u0027em wud gunpowder. I\u0027ve heard of its being done. I\u0027d never dig all the stuff out myself—yards of it there be—willer rootses always wur hemmed spready.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s never bin done in these parts.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, it\u0027ll be done now, surelye. It\u0027ll show the folk here I mean business—and that I\u0027m a chap wud ideas.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n There was indeed a mild excitement in the farms round Boarzell when Reuben\u0027s new plan became known. In those times gunpowder was seldom used for such purposes, and the undertaking was looked upon as a treat and a display.... \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Backfield\u0027s going to bust up his willer-rootses—fine sight it\u0027ll be—like as not blow his own head off—I\u0027ll be there to see.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n So when Reuben came to his territory the next [Pg 44]afternoon he found a small crowd assembled—Ditch, Ginner, Realf of Grandturzel, Coalbran of Doozes, Pilcher of Birdseye, with a sprinkling of their wives, families, and farm-hands. He himself had brought Naomi, and Harry was to join them when he came back from an errand to Moor\u0027s Cottage. Reuben felt a trifle important and in need of spectators. This was to be the crowning act of conquest. When those roots were shattered away there would be nothing but time and manure between him and the best oat-crop in Peasmarsh. \\n\\n \\n\\n A quarter of an hour passed, and there was no sign of Harry. Reuben grew impatient, for he wanted to have the ground tidied up by sunset. It was a wan, mould-smelling afternoon, and already the sun was drifting through whorls of coppery mist towards the shoulder of Boarzell. Reuben looked up to the gorse-clump on the ridge, from behind which he expected Harry to appear. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I can\u0027t wait any longer,\" he said to Naomi, \"something\u0027s kept him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He\u0027ll be disappointed,\" said Naomi softly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I can\u0027t help that—the sun\u0027s near down, and I must have everything pr?aper by dark.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He went to where the fuse lay like a snake in the grass, and struck his flint. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Stand back everybody; I\u0027m going to start her.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The group huddled back a few yards. The little flame writhed along towards the stump. There was silence. Reuben stood a little way in front of the others, leaning forward with eager, parted lips. \\n\\n \\n\\n Suddenly Naomi cried out: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There\u0027s Harry!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A shadow appeared against the copper sky, and ran towards them down the hill. \\n\\n \\n\\n For a moment nobody seemed to realise what was boding. Then they heard a shout that sounded like \"Wait for me!\" Naomi felt something rise in her throat and sear the roof of her mouth like a hot cinder.[Pg 45] She tried to scream, but her parched tongue would not move. She staggered forward, but Reuben flung her back. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Stop!\" he shouted. \\n\\n \\n\\n Harry did not seem to hear. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Stop!\" yelled Reuben again. Then he cried, \"Stand back!\" to the crowd, and ran towards his brother. \\n\\n \\n\\n But it was too late. There was a sudden roar, a sheet of flame, a crash, a dreadful scream, and then a far more dreadful silence. \\n\\n \\n\\n One or two flames sang out of a hole in the ground, but scarcely anything could be seen for the pall of smoke that hung over Boarzell, black, and evil-smelling. The fumes made men choke, then they shuddered and drew together, for through the smell of smoke and gunpowder came the horrible smell of burnt flesh. \\n\\n \\n\\n Reuben was lying on his face a few yards in front of the others. For some seconds nobody moved. Then Backfield slowly raised himself on his arms. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m not hurt,\" he said in a shaking voice. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Harry!\" cried Naomi, as if someone were strangling her. \\n\\n \\n\\n Reuben tottered to his feet. His face was black, and he was still half stunned by the explosion. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Harry!\" cried Naomi—and then fainted. \\n\\n \\n\\n The smoke clouds were lifting, and now everyone could see a smouldering object that lay close to the hole, among bits of wood and stone. \\n\\n \\n\\n Reuben ran towards it, Ditch and Realf followed him. The others huddled stupidly together like sheep. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"His clothes are still burning—here, help me, you!\" cried Reuben, beating at the flames with his hands. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He\u0027s dead,\" said Realf. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh Lord!\" wailed Ditch—\"Oh Lord!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He\u0027s bin hit on the head wud a piece of wood. I reckon he died painlessly. All this came afterwards.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Wipe the blood off his face.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Tell his poor girl he died wudout suffering.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He ?un\u0027t dead,\" said Reuben. \\n\\n \\n\\n He had torn off the rags from his brother\u0027s heart, and felt it beating. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He ?un\u0027t dead.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh Lord!\" wailed Ditch.—\"Oh Lord!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Here, you chaps, fetch a g?at and put him on it—and d?an\u0027t let Naomi see him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Naomi had been taken back to Odiam, when Harry, still motionless and apparently dead, was lifted on a gate, and borne away. Dark curds of smoke drifted among the willows, and the acrid smell of powder clung to the hillside like an evil ghost. The place where Harry had lain was marked by charred and trampled grass, and a great pool of blood was sinking into the ground ... it seemed to Reuben, as he turned shudderingly away, as if Boarzell were drinking it up—eagerly, greedily, as a thirsty land drinks up its first watering. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2094/59383.html","bookId":524,"book":{"id":524,"title":"Sussex Gorse The Story of a Fight","description":"简介： Boarzell Fair had been held every year on Boarzell Moor for as long as the oldest in Peasmarsh could remember.
