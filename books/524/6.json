{"id":21257,"no":6,"title":"Chapter 2","content":"Joseph Backfield was buried four days later. His body was carried to the church in a hay-waggon, drawn by the meek horses which had drawn his plough. Beside it walked Blackman, the only farm-hand at Odiam, in a clean smock, with a black ribbon tied to his hat. Five men from other farms acted with him as bearers—they were volunteers, for old Joseph had been popular in the neighbourhood, dealing sharply with no man. \n \n Immediately behind the cart walked Reuben with his mother on his arm. Her face was hidden in a clumsy black veil, which the Rye mantua-maker had assured her was the London fashion, and she was obviously ill at ease in the huge black shawl and voluminous skirts which the same fashion, according to the Rye mantua-maker, had decreed. Her hand pulled at Reuben\u0027s sleeve and stroked it as if for comfort. It was a smallish hand, and wonderfully soft for a farmer\u0027s wife—but then Mary Backfield had not lived like an ordinary farmer\u0027s wife. Under the thick veil, her face still had a certain soft colour and youthfulness, though she was nearly forty, and most women of her position were wrinkled and had lost their teeth by thirty-five. Also the curves of her figure were still delicate. She had been cherished by her husband, had done only light household work for him and borne him only two children. She carried the tokens of her happiness in smooth surfaces and soft lines. \n \n After Mrs. Backfield and her eldest son, walked Harry and his sweetheart, Naomi Gasson. They had been sweethearts just three months, and were such a couple as romance gloats over—young, comely, healthy, and full of love. Years had perfected the good looks of \"beautiful Harry.\" He was a tall creature, lithe and straight as a birch tree. His face, agreeably tanned, glowed with youth, half dreamy, half riotous; his eyes[Pg 27] were wild as a colt\u0027s, and yet tender. Naomi was a fit mate for him, with a skin like milk, and hair the colour of tansy. She wore a black gown like Mrs. Backfield, but she had made it herself, and it was friendly to her, hinting all the graciousness of her immaturity. These two tried to walk dejectedly, and no doubt there was some fresh young sadness in their hearts, but every now and then their bodies would straighten with their happiness, and their eyes turn half afraid from each other\u0027s because they could not help smiling in spite of the drooped lips. \n \n Then came old Gasson, Naomi\u0027s father, and well-known as a shipbuilder at Rye—for this was a good match of Harry\u0027s, and Reuben hoped, but had no reason to expect, he would turn it to Odiam\u0027s advantage. After him walked most of the farmers of the neighbourhood, come to see the last of a loved, respected friend. Even Pilbeam was there, from beyond Dallington, and Oake from Boreham Street. The Squire himself had sent a message of condolence, though he had been unable to come to the funeral. Reuben did not particularly want his sympathy. He despised the Bardons for their watery Liberalism and ineffectual efforts to improve their estates. \n \n It was about half a mile to the church—over the hanger of Tidebarn Hill. The morning was full of soft loamy smells, quickening under the February sun, which is so pale and errant, but sometimes seems to have the power to make the earth turn in its sleep and dream of spring. Peasmarsh church-tower, squab like a toadstool, looked at itself in the little spread of water at the foot of the churchyard. Beside this pool, darkened with winter sedges, stood Parson Barnaby, the Curate-in-Charge of Peasmarsh, Beckley, and Iden. His boots under his surplice were muddy and spurred, for he had just galloped over from a wedding at Iden, and his sweat dropped on the book as he read \"I know that my[Pg 28] Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth.\" \n \n Before committing the body to the ground, he said a few words in praise of the dead man. He spoke of his generosity to his neighbours, his kindness to his dependents, his excellences as a husband and a father. \"This, brethren, was indeed a man after God\u0027s own heart. He lived simply and blamelessly, contented with his lot, and seeking no happiness that did not also mean happiness to those around him. The call of the world\"—by which Mr. Barnaby meant Babylonish Rye—\"fell unheard on ears attuned to sweet domestic sounds. Ambition could not stir him from the repose of his family circle. Like a patriarch of old, he sat in peace under his vine and his fig-tree....\" \n \n Reuben stood motionless at the graveside, erect, like a soldier at attention. People in the crowd, who wearied of the dead man\u0027s virtues, whispered about the eldest son. \n \n \"Surelye!—he\u0027s a purty feller, is young Ben. To-day he looks nearly as valiant as Harry.\" \n \n \"He\u0027s a stouter man than his brother.\" \n \n \"Stouter, and darker. What black brows he has, Mus\u0027 Piper!\" \n \n \"How straight he stands!\" \n \n \"I w?onder wot he\u0027s thinking of.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2094/59378.html","bookId":524,"book":{"id":524,"title":"Sussex Gorse The Story of a Fight","description":"简介： Boarzell Fair had been held every year on Boarzell Moor for as long as the oldest in Peasmarsh could remember.
