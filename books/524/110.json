{"id":21361,"no":110,"title":"Chapter 2","content":"It was about that time that the great Lewin case came on at the Old Bailey. The papers were full of it, and Reuben could not suppress a glow of pride when Maude the dairy-woman read out the name of Richard Backfield as junior counsel for the defence. But his pride was to be still further exalted. The senior counsel collapsed with some serious illness on the very eve of the trial, and Richard stepped into his shoes. The papers were now full of his name, it was on everyone\u0027s lips[Pg 386] throughout the kingdom, and especially in the public-houses between Rye and the Kent border. Men stopped drinking at the Cocks when Reuben came in, and women ran down to their garden gates when he passed by. Reuben himself did not say much, but he now regularly took in a daily paper, and being able to recognise the name of Backfield in print, sat chasing the magic word through dark labyrinths of type, counting the number of its appearances and registering them on the back of his corn accounts. \n \n \"How\u0027s the Lewin c?ase gitting on?\" someone would ask at the Cocks, and Reuben would answer: \n \n \"Valiant—my n?um wur sixteen times in the p?aper this mornun.\" \n \n He almost taught himself to read by this means, for it was the first time he had ever studied a printed page, and he had soon picked up several words besides Backfield. Not that he took much interest in the case beyond Richard\u0027s—that is to say, Odiam\u0027s—share in it, but soon it became clear that Richard was leading it to marvellous developments. Lewin was a bank-manager accused of colossal frauds, and Richard amazed the country by dragging a couple of hitherto respected banking knights into the business. At one time it was thought he would get an acquittal by this, but Richard was a barrister, not a detective, and he brilliantly got his client acquitted on a point of law, which though it may have baffled a little the romantic enthusiasm of his newspaper admirers, made his name one to conjure with in legal circles, so that briefs were no longer matters of luck and prayer. \n \n His fortune was made by the Lewin case. He wrote home and told his father that he had now \"arrived,\" and was going to marry Anne Bardon. \n \n The excitement created by his defence of Lewin was nothing to that which now raged in Rye and Peasmarsh. Reuben was besieged by the curious, who found relief[Pg 387] for a slight alloy of envy by pointing out how unaccountable well the young man had done for himself by running away. \n \n \"Reckon you dudn\u0027t think as how it \u0027ud turn out lik this, or you wudn\u0027t have been in such tedious heart about it.\" \n \n \"I can\u0027t say as I\u0027m pleased at his marrying Miss Bardon,\" Reuben would say. \"She\u0027s ten year older than he if she\u0027s a day. \u0027Twas she who asked him, I reckon. He could have done better fur himself if he\u0027d stayed at h?ame.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2094/59482.html","bookId":524,"book":{"id":524,"title":"Sussex Gorse The Story of a Fight","description":"简介： Boarzell Fair had been held every year on Boarzell Moor for as long as the oldest in Peasmarsh could remember.
