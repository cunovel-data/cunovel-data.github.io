{"id":21282,"no":31,"title":"Chapter 13","content":"It was the August of another year. Reuben\u0027s new land on Boarzell was tawny with oats. He had at last broken into that defiant earth and taken handfuls of its treasure. To-day he inspected his crop, and planned for its reaping. With parted lips and a faint sensuous gleam in his eyes he watched it bow and ripple before the little breeze that stole over the hedges from Tiffenden. He drank in the scent of the baking awns, the heat of the sun-cracked earth. It was all dear to him—all ecstasy. And he himself was dear to himself because the beauty of it fell upon him ... his body, strong and tired, smelling a little of sweat, his back scorched by the heat in which he had bent, his hand strong as iron upon his sickle. Oh Lord! it was good to be a man, to feel the sap of life and conquest running in you, to be battling with mighty forces, to be able to fight seasons, elements, earth, and nature.... \\n\\n \\n\\n He turned and walked slowly homewards, a smile on his lips. As he passed the orchard, where a crop of plums was ripening, the shrill whir of a bird-rattle made him look up. There in the long grass stood his young Albert, dutifully scaring sparrows from the trees. He had been there all the afternoon, and Reuben[Pg 113] beckoned to him to come in to tea. Further on, in the yard, he encountered Robert feeding the chickens out of an enormous bowl carried by Pete, whose arms with difficulty embraced its girth. He summoned these two in. His family trotted after him at a respectful distance. They did not speak, except to say \"Oo\" occasionally to each other. \\n\\n \\n\\n In the kitchen a substantial meal was prepared. It was the children\u0027s supper, and was to last Reuben till he came in at nine o\u0027clock and had a bowl of broth before going to bed. Old Mrs. Backfield was settling the children round the table. Caro and Tilly showed only their heads above the cloth, a piece of neck proclaimed Benjamin\u0027s extra inches, while Richard had quite two buttons to his credit. Harry sat at the bottom beside Caroline; when he heard Albert\u0027s rattle, he seized it and began making a hideous din. Caro and Tilly began to cry, and Reuben snatched the rattle away. \\n\\n \\n\\n He sat down, and immediately his mother put a plate of hot bacon before him. She was vexed because it was the only meat he allowed himself on week-days. The children ate bread and milk, and thrived on it, to judge by their round healthy faces. Reuben was proud of them. They were fine children, and he hoped that the one that was coming would be as sturdy. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How is she?\" he asked Mrs. Backfield. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She slept a bit this afternoon. I took her a cup of tea at five, but I think the heat tries her.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll go up and see her soon as I\u0027ve finished—Harry, t?ake your hand out of the baby\u0027s pl?ate.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n As soon as the supper was over, Reuben still munching bread and bacon went up to his wife\u0027s room. The sunlight was gone, but the sky was blood-red behind Boarzell\u0027s hulk, and a flushed afterglow hung on the ceiling and moved slowly like a fire over the bed. The corners of the room, the shadows cast by the furniture, were black and smoky. On Naomi\u0027s face, on her body[Pg 114] outlined under the sheet, the lights crimsoned and smouldered. There was a strange fiery reflection in her eyes as she turned them to the door. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, my dear, how are you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m very well, thank you, Backfield.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She always said that. \\n\\n \\n\\n He came over to the bed and looked down on her. Her eyes were haunting ... and the vestiges of youth about her face. But he no longer pitied or spared. Boarzell had taught him his first lesson—that only the hard shall triumph in the hard fight, and that he who would spare his brother shall do no better than he who would spare himself. \\n\\n \\n\\n He sat down beside her and took her hand. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I hear you had some sleep this afternoon.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes—I slept for an hour. I think I\u0027m better.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Her voice was submissive—or indifferent. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve bin on the new land all to-day. It\u0027s doing justabout splendid. Those oats are as dentical as wheat—not a sedge-leaf adin them.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She made a faint sound to show that she had heard him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Albert\u0027s bin in the orchard scaring sparrers, and Robert and Pete wur helping wud the chickens. My family\u0027s gitting quite valiant now, Mrs. Backfield.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll soon be able to have Richard on, and then there\u0027s still Jemmy to foller—and George.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mmm.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now d?an\u0027t you put me off wud Georgina.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Her mouth stretched mechanically into a smile, and at the same time a tear slid out of the corner of her eye, and rolled slowly over her thin cheeks. In the red, smouldering light of the sky behind Boarzell it looked like a tear of blood. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2094/59403.html","bookId":524,"book":{"id":524,"title":"Sussex Gorse The Story of a Fight","description":"简介： Boarzell Fair had been held every year on Boarzell Moor for as long as the oldest in Peasmarsh could remember.
