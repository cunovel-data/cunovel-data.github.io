{"id":21329,"no":78,"title":"Chapter 10","content":"Rose\u0027s child was born towards the end of October. Once more Reuben had a son, and as he looked down on the little red hairless thing all his hopes and dreams were built anew. He had always lived too near the earth to let experience thump him into cynicism. He raised as glorious dreams over this baby as he had raised over the others, and seen crumble into ashes. Indeed, the fact that his earlier hopes had failed made him warm himself more gratefully at this rekindling. He saw himself at last raised out of the pit of difficulty—he would not lose this boy as he had lost the others, he would perhaps be softer and more indulgent, he would at all events be wiser, and the child should indeed be a son to him and to Odiam. \"Unto Us—Reuben and Odiam—a child is born; unto Us a son is given.\" \n \n He was soon confirmed in his idea that the birth had brought him luck. Before little David was a week old, the welcome news came that Lardner had died. For[Pg 273] some time he had been able to swallow only milk food, and his speech had been reduced to a confused roaring, but his death at this juncture seemed to Reuben a happy coincidence, an omen of good fortune for himself and his son. \n \n He was so pleased that he forgot to veil his pleasure before Rose, whose grief reminded him of the fact that Lardner was a near and dear relation, whose death must be looked upon as a chastisement from heaven. In a fit of compunction for his behaviour, he ordered a complete suit of mourning, in which he attended the funeral. He was soft and benign to all men now, and soothed Rose\u0027s ruffled spirit by showing himself to her in all the glory of a top-hat with crape weepers before setting out for Starvecrow. \n \n He himself had helped plan the obsequies, which were carried out with all possible pomp by a Rye undertaker. After the ceremony there was a funeral meal at Starvecrow, where sedate joints and solemn whiskies were partaken of in the right spirit by the dozen or so men and women who were privileged to hear old Lardner\u0027s will. This was read by the deceased\u0027s lawyer, and one or two pleased malicious glances were darted at Reuben from under decorously lowered lids. He sat with his fists doubled upon his knees, hearing as if in a nightmare: \n \n \"I bequeath the farm of Starvecrow, with all lands, stock, and tools pertaining thereto, also the house and fixtures, together with seven thousand pounds to Henry Robert Crick of Lone Mills, Ontario, Canada, my dear son by Marion Crick.... My household furniture and fifty pounds free of legacy duty I bequeath to my niece, Rose Backfield, wife of Reuben Backfield of Odiam.\" \n \n Reuben felt dazed and sick, the solemn faces of the[Pg 274] mourners seemed to leer at him, he was seized by a contemptuous hatred of his kind. There was some confused buzzing talk, but he did not join in it. He shook hands deliriously with the lawyer, muttered something about having to get back, and elbowed his way out of the room. Pete had driven over to fetch him in his gig, as befitted the dignity of a yeoman farmer and nephew-by-marriage of the deceased, but Reuben angrily bade him go home alone. He could not sit still, he must walk, stride off his fury, the frenzy of rage and disgust and disappointment that consumed him. \n \n What business had old Lardner to have a natural son? Never had the laws of morality seemed to Reuben so august and necessary as then, or their infringement more contemptible. He was filled with a righteous loathing of this crapulous libertine who perpetuated the vileness of some low intrigue by bequeathing his worldly goods to his bastard. Meantime his virtuously married niece was put off with fifty pounds and some trashy furniture. Reuben fairly grovelled before the seventh commandment that afternoon. \n \n He staggered blindly along the road. His head swam with rage, and also, it must be confessed, with something else—for he was not used to drinking whisky, which some obscure local tradition considered the only decent beverage at funerals. His face was flushed, and every now and then something would be whirled round by the wind and whip his cheeks and blind him momentarily in a black cloud. At first he was too confused to grapple with it, but when two long black arms suddenly wound themselves about his neck, nearly choking him, he remembered his hat with the crape weepers, and his rage from red-hot became white-hot and cinerating. He tore off the hat with its long black tails, and flung it into the ditch with a volley of those emasculate oaths which are all the swearing of a Sussex man. \n \n Afterwards he felt better, but he was still fuming[Pg 275] when he came to Odiam, and dashed up straight to Rose\u0027s bedroom, where she lay with the ten-days-old David and a female friend from Rye, who had come in to hear details about her confinement. Both, not to say all three, were startled by Reuben\u0027s sudden entrance, crimson and hatless, his collar flying, the dust all over him. \n \n \"Here! Wot d\u0027you think?\" he shouted; \"if that old man ?un\u0027t left all his money to a bastard.\" \n \n \"Don\u0027t be so excited, Ben,\" said Rose; \"you\u0027ve no business to come bursting in here like this.\" \n \n \"Remember your wife\u0027s delicate,\" said the lady friend. \n \n \"Well, wot I want to know is why you dudn\u0027t tell me all this afore.\" \n \n \"How could I? I didn\u0027t know how uncle was going to leave his money.\" \n \n \"You might have found out, and not let me in fur all this. Here I\u0027ve bin and gone and spent all your settlements on a milk-round, which I\u0027d never have done if I hadn\u0027t thought summat more \u0027ud be coming in later.\" \n \n \"Well, I can\u0027t help it. I expect that as uncle knew I was well provided for, married and settled and all that, he thought he\u0027d rather leave his stuff to someone who wasn\u0027t.\" \n \n \"I like that—and you the most expensive woman to keep as ever was. \n \n \"Hold your tongue, Ben. I\u0027m surprised at you.\" \n \n \"I justabout will speak. A purty mess you\u0027ve got me into. You ought to have told me before we married as he had a son out in Canada.\" \n \n \"I didn\u0027t know. This is the first I\u0027ve heard of it. Anyhow, you surely don\u0027t mean to say you married me for my money.\" \n \n \"Well, I wouldn\u0027t have married you if you hadn\u0027t got none.\" \n \n \"For Shame!\" said the lady friend. \n \n Rose burst into tears, and young David, interrupted[Pg 276] in the midst of an excellent meal, sent up a piercing wail. \n \n \"You\u0027d better go downstairs till you know how to speak to your wife properly,\" said the female from Rye. \n \n \"My wife\u0027s deceived me!\" shouted Reuben. \"I made sure as she\u0027d come in fur thousands of pounds when old Lardner died, and all she\u0027s got out of him is fifty pounds and his lousy furniture.\" \n \n \"Furniture?\" said Rose, brisking up; \"why from what you said I thought there was nothing. I could do with some furniture. I want a bedstead with brass knobs.\" \n \n \"Well, you shan\u0027t have it. I\u0027ll justabout sell the whole lot. You can\u0027t prevent me.\" \n \n Rose\u0027s sobs burst forth afresh. Her friend ran up to her and took her in her arms, badly squeezing poor David, who became purple and entirely animal in his remonstrances. \n \n Then the two women fairly stormed at Reuben. They told him he was a money-grubber, an unnatural father, that he had been drinking, that he ought to be ashamed of himself, that he had only got what he deserved. Reuben tried to stand up to them, but Rose had an amazing power of invective, and her friend, who was a spinster, but sometimes forgot it, filled in the few available pauses so effectively that in the end the wretched husband was driven from the room, feeling that the world held even worse things than wealthy and perfidious libertines. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2094/59450.html","bookId":524,"book":{"id":524,"title":"Sussex Gorse The Story of a Fight","description":"简介： Boarzell Fair had been held every year on Boarzell Moor for as long as the oldest in Peasmarsh could remember.
