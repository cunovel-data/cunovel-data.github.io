{"id":21331,"no":80,"title":"Chapter 12","content":"In time, as these battles became more usual, the family were forced to take sides. Peter supported Reuben, Caro supported Rose. There had been an odd kind of friendship between the downtrodden daughter and the gay wife ever since they had unpacked the latter\u0027s trunks together on her wedding night and Caro had cried because Rose had what she might never have. Rose approved of this attitude—she liked to be envied; also Caro was useful to her in many ways, helping her[Pg 280] in the house, taking the burden of many irksome duties off her shoulders, leaving her free to entertain her friends or mix complexion washes. Moreover, there was something in Caro which appealed in itself, a certain heavy innocence which tickled the humour of the younger, more-experienced woman. Once her stepdaughter had asked her what it felt like to be kissed, which had sent Rose into rockings of laughter and a carnival of reminiscence. She liked to dazzle this elderly child with her \"affairs,\" she liked to shock her a little too. She soon discovered that Caro was deeply scandalised at the thought of a married woman having men friends to visit her, so she encouraged the counter-jumpers and the clerks for Caro\u0027s benefit as well as Reuben\u0027s. It never occurred to her to throw these young people together, and give the girl a chance of fighting her father and satisfying the vague longings for adventure and romance which had begun to put torment into her late twenties. She often told her it was a scandal that she had never been allowed to know men, but her own were too few and useful to be sacrificed to the forlorn. Besides, Caro had an odd shy way with men which sometimes made them laugh at her. She had little charm, and though not bad-looking in a heavy black-browed style, she had no feminine arts, and always appeared to the very worst advantage. Those were not very good times for Caro. She envied Rose, and at the same time she loved her, as women will so often love those they envy. Rose\u0027s attitude was one of occasional enthusiasm and occasional neglect. Sometimes she would give her unexpected treats, make her presents of clothes, or take her to a fair or to see the shops; at others she would seem to forget all about her. She thought Caro a poor thing for not standing up to Reuben, and despised her for her lack of feminine wiles. At the same time she would often be extremely confidential, she would pour out stories of love and[Pg 281] kisses by moonlight, of ardent words, of worship, of ecstasy, and send Caro wandering over strange paths, asking strange questions of herself and fate, and sometimes—to the other\u0027s delight—of Rose. \"Wot do you do to make a man kiss you?\" \"Oh, I dunno. I just look at him like this with my eyes half shut. Then if that isn\u0027t enough I part my lips—so.\" The two women had been bathing. It was one of Rose\u0027s complaints that Odiam did not make enough provision for personal cleanliness in the way of baths and tubs. Reuben objected if she made the servant run up and downstairs ten times or so with jugs of hot water to fill a wash-tub in her bedroom—they had once had a battle royal about it, during which Rose had said some humorous things about her man\u0027s washing—so in summer she relieved the tension by bathing in the Glotten brook, where it ran temporarily limpid and reclused at the foot of the old hop-garden. She had persuaded Caro to join her in this adventure—according to her ideas it was not becoming for a woman to bathe alone; so Caro had conquered her objections to undressing behind a bush, and tasted for the first time the luxury of a daily, or all but daily, bath. Now they were dry and dressed once more, all except their stockings, for Rose loved to splash her bare feet in the water—she adored the caress of water on her skin. It was a hot day, the sun blinked through the heavy green of the sallows, dabbling the stream with spots and ripples of light. June had come, with a thick swarthiness in the fields, and the scent of hayseed scorching into ripeness. Rose leaned back against a trunk, a froth of fine linen round her knees. She splashed and kicked her feet in the stream. \"Yes—I\u0027ve only to look at a man like this ... and he always does it.\" \"But not now!\" cried Caro. \"What do you mean by \u0027not now\u0027?\" \"Now you\u0027re married.\" \"Oh, no—I\u0027m talking of before. All the same....\" \"Wot!\" \"Nothing. You\u0027d be shocked.\" Caro looked gloomily at the water. She did not like being told she would be shocked, though she knew she would be. At that moment there was a sound of \"git back\" and \"woa\" beyond the hedge. The next minute two horses stepped into the Glotten just by the bend. \"That must be Handshut,\" said Rose. It was. He came knee-deep into the water with the horses, and, not seeing the women, plunged his head into the cool reed-sweetened stickle. \"Take care—he\u0027ll see us!\"—and Caro sharply gathered up her legs under her blue and red striped petticoat. Rose continued to dabble hers in the water, even after Handshut had lifted his head and looked in her direction. \"Rose!\" cried Caro. \"Well, why shouldn\u0027t he see my legs? They\u0027re unaccountable nice ones.\" \"All the more reason——\" \"Not at all, Miss Prude.\" Caro went crimson to the roots of her hair, and began pulling on her stockings. Rose continued to splash her feet in the water, glancing sidelong at Handshut. \"He\u0027s a nice lad, ain\u0027t he?\" Caro vouchsafed no reply. \"Reuben knows he\u0027s a nice lad, and he knows I know he\u0027s a nice lad. Hasn\u0027t he got a lovely brown skin?\" \"Hush.\" But Rose was in a devilish mood. \"Look here,\" she said suddenly, \"I\u0027m going to prove[Pg 283] the truth of what I told you just now. I\u0027m going to make that boy kiss me.\" \"Indeed you ?un\u0027t.\" \"Yes I am. I\u0027ll go down and talk to him at the bend, and you can creep along and watch us through the hedge; and I\u0027ll shut my eyes and maybe part my lips, and he\u0027ll kiss me, you see if he don\u0027t.\" \"I won\u0027t see anything of the kind. I\u0027m ashamed of you.\" \"Nonsense—it\u0027s only fun—we\u0027ll make a bet on it. If I fail, I\u0027ll give you my new white petticoat with the lace edging. And I\u0027ll allow myself ten minutes to do it in; that\u0027s quite fair, for it usually takes me longer.\" \"And what am I to give you if you succeed?\" \"Nothing—the kiss\u0027ll be enough for me. I\u0027ve been wanting to know what he was like to kiss for many a long day.\" \"Well, I\u0027m justabout ashamed of you, and I w?an\u0027t have anything to do with it.\" \"You can keep out then.\" \"Wot if I tell f?ather?\" \"You wouldn\u0027t tell him—you wouldn\u0027t be such a sneak. After all, what\u0027s a man for, if it isn\u0027t to have a bit of fun with? I don\u0027t mean anything serious—it\u0027s just a joke.\" \"What\u0027ll Handshut think it?\" \"Just a joke too. You\u0027re so glum, Caro—you take everything so seriously. There\u0027s nothing really serious in a kiss.\" \"Oh, ?un\u0027t there!\" \"No—it\u0027s just something one enjoys, same as cakes and bull\u0027s-eyes. I\u0027ve kissed dozens of people in my time and meant nothing by it, nor they either. It\u0027s because you\u0027ve no experience of these things that you think such a lot of \u0027em. They\u0027re quite unimportant really, and it\u0027s silly to make a fuss.\" For some obscure reason Caro did not like to see [Pg 284]herself credited with the harshness of inexperience. She did her best to assume an air of worldly toleration. \"Well, of course if it\u0027s only fun.... But f?ather wudn\u0027t think it that.\" \"No, and I shouldn\u0027t like him to. You are funny, Caro. Don\u0027t watch me if you\u0027re shocked—you can know nothing about it, and then you won\u0027t be to blame. But I\u0027m going to have my lark in spite of you.\" \"Put on your stockings first,\" said Caro sternly. Rose made a face at her, but pulled on a pair of gauzy stockings, securing them with garters of pale blue ribbon. Then she scrambled to her feet and edged her way through the reeds and bushes to where young Handshut stood at the bend. He was not visible from where Caro sat, for he had come out of the water, and for a minute or two she vowed that she would have nothing to do with Rose\u0027s disgraceful spree. But after a time her curiosity got the better of her. Would Rose be able to do as she said—persuade her husband\u0027s drover to kiss her, simply by looking at him through half-closed eyes? Of course Handshut was very forward, Caro told herself, she had often disliked his attitude towards his mistress—he would not want much encouragement. All the same she wanted to see if Rose succeeded, and if she succeeded—how. She craned her neck, but could see nothing till she had crept a few yards through the reeds. Then she saw Rose and Handshut sitting just beyond the hedge, by the water\u0027s rim. The horses were drowsing in the stream, flicking at the flies with their tails. Rose\u0027s dress made a brave blue splash against the green, and the gold-flecked chestnut of her hair was very close to Handshut\u0027s brown curls. Caro could dimly hear their voices, though she could not distinguish what they said. Five minutes had passed, and still, though close, there was a decent space between them. Then there was a little lull in the flow of talk.[Pg 285] They were looking at each other. Caro crept nearer, something like a hot cinder in her heart. They were still looking at each other. Then Handshut began to speak in a lower voice than usual; he stopped—and suddenly their heads stooped together, the gold and the brown touched, mingled, lingered, then drew slowly apart. Caro sprang to her feet. The couple in the field had risen too, but they did not see her through the hedge. Her heart beat fiercely with an uncontrollable anger. She could have shouted, screamed at them—at her rather, this gay, comfortable, plump, spoilt wife, who had so many kisses that she could look upon one more or less as fun. Rose\u0027s merry, rather strident laugh rang out on the hushed noon. Handshut stood facing her with his head held down; then she turned away from him and laughed again. Her laugh rose, fluttered—then suddenly broke. It snapped like a broken knife. She turned back towards Handshut, and they faced each other once more. Then Caro saw a strange and rather terrible thing. She saw those two who had kissed for fun stumble together in an embrace which was not for fun at all, and kiss with kisses that were closer to tears than laughter.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2094/59452.html","bookId":524,"book":{"id":524,"title":"Sussex Gorse The Story of a Fight","description":"简介： Boarzell Fair had been held every year on Boarzell Moor for as long as the oldest in Peasmarsh could remember.
