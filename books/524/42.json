{"id":21293,"no":42,"title":"Chapter 10","content":"In August Reuben bought ten more acres of Boarzell, and the yoke tightened on Odiam. All had now been pressed into service, even the epileptic George. From morning till night feet tramped, hoofs stamped, wheels rolled, backs bent, arms swung. Reuben himself worked hardest of all, for to his actual labour must be added long tramps from one part of the farm to the other to superintend his sons\u0027 work. Besides, he would allow nothing really important to be undertaken without him. He must be present when the first scythe swept into the hay, when his wonderful horse-reaper took its first step along the side of the cornfield, he must himself see to the spreading of the hops over the drying furnaces in the oasts, or rise in the cold twinkling hour after midnight to find out how Buttercup was doing with her calf. \n \n Pete made an able and keen lieutenant, but the other boys were still disappointing. It is true that Benjamin worked well and was often smart enough, but he had a roving disposition, which was more dangerous than Albert\u0027s, since it led him invariably down to the muddy Rother banks at Rye, where the great ships stood in the water, filling the air with good smells of fish and tar. Jemmy would loaf for hours round the capstans and building-stocks, and the piles of muddy rope that smelled of ooze, and he would talk to the sailormen and fishermen about voyages to the Azores and the Cape or to the wild seas south of the Horn, and would come home prating of sails and smoke-stacks, charts and logs,[Pg 148] and other vain things that had nothing to do with Odiam. Reuben remembered that the boy\u0027s mother came of a family of ship-builders and sailormen, and he would tremble for Jemmy\u0027s allegiance, and punish his truancies twice as severely as Albert\u0027s. \n \n Another trial to him now was that Robert seemed half-hearted. Hitherto he had always worked conscientiously and well, even though he had never been smart or particularly keen; but now he seemed to loaf and slack—he dawdled, slipped clear of what he could, and once he actually asked Reuben for wages! This was unheard-of—not one of Reuben\u0027s sons had ever dreamed of such a thing before. \n \n \"Wages!—wot are you wanting wages fur, young r?ascal? You\u0027re working to save money, not to earn it. You wait till all yon Moor is mine, and Odiam\u0027s the biggest farm in Sussex, before you ask fur wages.\" \n \n Up till then Robert had never troubled much about money. He did not want to buy books like Albert and Richard, neither did he care for drinking in Rye pubs with fishermen like Jemmy. But now everything was changed. He wanted money for Bessie. He wanted to marry her, and he must have money for that, no matter how meanly they started; and also he wanted to give her treats and presents, to cheer the dullness of her life. Reuben had indeed been wise in trying to keep the girls away from his sons! \n \n There are no two such things for sharpening human wits as fullness of love and shortness of cash. Robert\u0027s brain was essentially placid and lumbering, but under this double spur it began to work wonders. After much pondering he thought of a plan. It was part of his duties to snare rabbits on Boarzell. Every evening he went round and inspected the traps, killed any little squealing prisoners that were in them, and sold them on market days at Rye. It was after all an easy thing to report and hand over the money for ten rabbits a[Pg 149] week, while keeping the price of, say, three more, and any other man would have thought of it sooner. \n \n In this way he managed to do a few little things to brighten Bessie\u0027s grey life—and his own too, though he did not know it was grey. Every week he put aside a shilling or two towards the lump sum which was at last to make their marriage possible. It was Reuben\u0027s fight for Boarzell on an insignificant scale—though Robert, who had not so much iron in him as his father, could not resist spending money from time to time on unnecessary trifles that would give Bessie happiness. For one thing he discovered that she had never been to the Fair. She had never known the delights of riding on the merry-go-round, throwing balls at Aunt Sally, watching the shooting or the panorama. Robert resolved to take her that autumn, and bought her a pair of white cotton gloves in preparation for the day. \n \n Unluckily, however, he was not made for a career of prolonged fraud, and he ingloriously foundered in that sea of practical details through which the cunning man must steer his schemes. He fixed the number of rabbits to be sold at Rye as ten a week, pocketing the surplus whether it were one or six. This was a pretty fair average, but its invariable occurrence for seven or eight weeks could not fail to strike Reuben, whose brain was not placid and slow-moving like his son\u0027s. \n \n The one thing against the idea that Robert was swindling him was that he thought Robert utterly incapable of so much contrivance. However, he had noticed several changes in the boy of late, and he resolved to wait another two weeks, keeping his eyes open and his tongue still. Each week ten rabbits were reported sold at Rye and the money handed over to him. On the morning of the next market day, when Robert\u0027s cart, piled with eggs, fruit, vegetables, and poultry, was at the door, Reuben came out and inspected it. \n \n \"Let\u0027s see your conies,\" he said briefly. \n \n It was as if someone had suddenly laid a cold hand on Robert\u0027s heart. He guessed that his father suspected him. His ears turned crimson, and his hands trembled and fumbled as he opened the back of the cart and took out his string of properly skinned and gutted conies. \n \n Reuben counted them—ten. Then he pushed them aside, and began rummaging in the cart among cabbages and bags of apples. In a second or two he had dragged out five more rabbits. Robert stood with hanging head, flushed cheeks, and quivering hands, till his father fulfilled his expectations by knocking him down. \n \n \"So that\u0027s the way you queer me, you young villain. You steal, you hide, you try to bust the farm. It\u0027s luck you\u0027re even a bigger fool than you are scamp, and I\u0027ve caught you justabout purty.\" \n \n He kicked Robert, and called up Richard to drive the cart over to Rye. \n \n An hour later the whole of the boy\u0027s plans, and worse still his sinews of war, were in the enemy\u0027s possession. Reuben ransacked his son\u0027s mind as easily as he ransacked his pockets and the careful obvious little hiding-place under his mattress where lay the twenty-two shillings of which he had defrauded Odiam. His love for Bessie, his degraded and treacherous hopes, filled the father with shame. Had he then lived so meanly that such mean ambitions should inspire his son? \n \n \"A cowman\u0027s girl!\" he groaned, \"at Eggs Hole, too, where they d?an\u0027t know plums from damsons! Marry her! I\u0027d sooner have Albert and his wenches.\" \n \n \"I love her,\" faltered Robert. \n \n \"Well, you\u0027ll justabout have to stop loving her, that\u0027s all. I\u0027m not going to have my place upset by love. Love\u0027s all very well when there\u0027s something wud it or when there\u0027s nothing in it. But marrying cowmen\u0027s girls wudout a penny in their pockets, we can\u0027t afford to kip that sort o\u0027 love at Odiam.\" \n \n \"F?ather,\" pleaded Robert, \"you loved my mother.\" \n \n \"Yes—but she wur a well-born lady wud a fortun. D\u0027you think I\u0027d have let myself love her if she\u0027d bin poor and a cowman\u0027s daughter? Not me, young feller!\" \n \n \"But you can\u0027t help loving, surelye.\" \n \n \"Well, if that\u0027s wot you think, the sooner you find out that you can help loving the better. Did I ever hear such weak womanish slop! Help loving? You\u0027ll help it before you\u0027re many days older. Meantime you kip away from that girl, and all them hemmed choir-singings which are the ruin of young people.\" \n \n The colour rushed into Robert\u0027s cheeks, and something very unfamiliar and very unmanly into his eyes. \n \n \"I\u0027ll——\" he began desperately. But even Robert had the wit not to finish his sentence. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2094/59414.html","bookId":524,"book":{"id":524,"title":"Sussex Gorse The Story of a Fight","description":"简介： Boarzell Fair had been held every year on Boarzell Moor for as long as the oldest in Peasmarsh could remember.
