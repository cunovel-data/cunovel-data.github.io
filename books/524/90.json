{"id":21341,"no":90,"title":"Chapter 22","content":"A glassy yellow broke into the sky like a curse. It shone on Reuben\u0027s eyes, and he opened them. They were pink and puffed round the rims, and the whites were shot with little blood-vessels. His cheeks were yellow, and round his mouth was an odd greyish tinge. He had lain dressed on his bed, and was surprised to find that he had slept. But the sleep had brought no refreshment—there was a bad taste in his mouth, and his tongue felt rough and thick. \n \n He sat up on the tumbled bed and looked round him.[Pg 318] Rose\u0027s nightgown was folded on her pillow, and over a chair lay a pair of the thin useless stockings he had often scolded her for wearing. A drawer was open, and from it came the soft perfume that adhered to everything she put on. He suddenly sprang out of bed and shut it with a kick. \n \n \"Durn her!\" he said, and then two sobs tore their way painfully up his throat, shaking his whole body. \n \n An hour later he went down. He had washed and tidied himself, none the less he disconcerted the household. Caro had lain awake all night, partly from misery, partly because of the baby, which she had been obliged to take charge of in the mother\u0027s absence. She had brought it down into the kitchen with her, and it had lain kicking in its cradle while she prepared the breakfast. She was worn out already after her sleepless night, and could not prevent the tears from trickling down her face as she cut bread for the meal. \n \n \"Stop that!\" said Reuben roughly. \n \n Except for this, he did not speak—nor after a few attempts on the former\u0027s part did Pete and Caro. They sat and gulped down their food in silence. Even Harry seemed to realise the general unrest. He would not sit at table, but wandered aimlessly up and down the room, murmuring, as was now his habit in times of domestic upheaval, \"Another wedding—deary me! We\u0027re always having weddings in this house.\" \n \n Then the baby began to howl because it was hungry. Rose had nursed it herself, and its wants had not occurred to the unhappy Caro or her father. There was delay and confusion while a bottle was fetched and milk prepared, and then—to crown all—cow\u0027s milk upset it, and it was sick. But Reuben escaped this final tragedy—he had left the room after a few mouthfuls, and gone to Handshut\u0027s cottage. \n \n He could not restrain himself any longer. He must see Rose, and vent on her all the miserable rage with[Pg 319] which his heart was seething. He longed to strike her—he longed to beat her, for the wanton that she was. And he longed to clasp her in his arms and weep on her breast and caress her, for the woman that she was. \n \n But the cottage was shut. With its red-rotting roof between two tall chimneys it looked exactly like a rabbit\u0027s head between its ears; the windows were blind, though it was past seven o\u0027clock, and though Reuben knocked at the door loudly, there was no one to be seen. He prowled once or twice round the house, fumbling handles and window-latches, but there was no way of getting in. He listened, but he could not hear a sound. He pictured Rose and Handshut in each other\u0027s arms, laughing at him in his wretchedness and their bliss—and all the time he wanted the woman\u0027s blood more than the man\u0027s. \n \n At last he wandered desperately away, treading the furrows of his new ground on Boarzell, reckless that he trod the young seed harrowed into them. In that black moment even his winter crops were nothing to him. He saw, thought of, realised only one thing—and that was Rose, the false, the gay, the wanton, and the beautiful—oh the beautiful!—laughing at him from another man\u0027s arms. He could see her laughing, see just how her lips parted, just how her teeth shone—those little teeth, so regular except for the pointed canines—just how the dimples came at the corners of her mouth, those dear little hollows which he had dug with his kisses.... \n \n He ground his heel into the soft harrowed earth, and it cast up its smell into his nostrils unheeded. But the day of Boarzell was coming—its rival had been cleared out of the field, and the great hump with its knob of firs seemed to be lying in wait, till the man had pulled himself out of the pit of a false woman\u0027s love and given himself back to it, the strong, the faithful enemy. \n \n About an hour later Reuben was down again at[Pg 320] Handshut\u0027s cottage, but this time a change had worked itself. The door hung wide open—and the place was empty. He went through the two miserable little rooms, but there was no one, and nowhere for anybody to hide. The remains of a meal of bread and tea were on the table, and a fire of sticks was dying on the hearth. The lovers had flown—to laugh at him from a safe distance. \n \n All the rest of the day he prowled aimlessly about his land. His men were afraid, for it was the first time they had seen him spend a day without work. He touched neither spade nor pitchfork, he gave no orders, just wandered restlessly about the fields and barns. He ate no supper, but locked himself into his room, while the baby\u0027s thin wail rose through the beams of the kitchen ceiling, and little David cried fractiously for \"mother.\" \n \n The next day Caro, haggard after another night made sleepless by her charges, knocked at his door. He had not come down to breakfast, and at eight o\u0027clock the postman had brought a letter. \n \n \"It\u0027s from Rose,\" said Caro timidly. \n \n \"To me?\" \n \n \"No, to me.\" \n \n \"Read it.\" \n \n Caro read it. Rose was in London, but left that day for Liverpool. Handshut had saved a little money, and they were going to Canada. \"I don\u0027t ask Ben to forgive me, for I know he never will.\" \n \n \"She\u0027s right there,\" said Reuben grimly. \n \n Caro stood before him, creasing the letter nervously. Her father\u0027s wrath broke upon her, for want of his proper victim. \n \n \"Git out, can\u0027t yer—wot are you dawdling here for? You women are all the same—you\u0027d be as bad as her if you cud only git a man.\" \n \n Caro shrank from the jibe as if from a blow, and Reuben laughed brutally. He had made one woman suffer anyway. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2094/59462.html","bookId":524,"book":{"id":524,"title":"Sussex Gorse The Story of a Fight","description":"简介： Boarzell Fair had been held every year on Boarzell Moor for as long as the oldest in Peasmarsh could remember.
