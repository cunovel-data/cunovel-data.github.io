{"id":21289,"no":38,"title":"Chapter 6","content":"Towards the end of February there was a period of intense cold, and some heavy falls of snow. Snow was rare in that south-east corner, and all farm-work was to a certain extent dislocated. Reuben would have liked to spread blankets over his corn-fields and put shirts on his cattle. Adverse weather conditions never failed to stir up his inborn combativeness to its fiercest. His sons trembled as his brain raged with body-racking plans for fighting this new move of nature\u0027s. Richard was glad to be away from farmyard exertions, most of which struck him as absurd. He was now busy with the last of his lambing, the snow blew against the hut from the north-east, piling itself till nothing was to be seen from that quarter but a white lump. Inside was a crimson stuffiness, as the fumes of the brazier found their way slowly out of the little tin chimney. Sometimes before the brazier a motherless lamb would lie. There was a lamb there on the last evening in February, its tiny body and long, weak legs all rosed over with the glow. Above it Richard crouched, grammar in hand. There had been a lull in the snowstorm during the afternoon, but now once more the wind was piping and screaming over the fields and the whiteness heaping itself against the wall. Suddenly he heard a knock at the door, and before he could answer, it flew open, and the icy blast, laden with snow, rushed in, and whirled round the hut, fluttering the pages of Lilly\u0027s grammar and the fleece of the lamb. \"Shut that door!\" cried Richard angrily, and then realised that he was speaking to a lady. She had shut the door, and stood against it, a tall,[Pg 134] rather commanding figure, in spite of her snow-covered garments and dishevelled hair. \"Oh—ma\u0027am!\" said Richard, rising to his feet, and recognising Miss Anne Bardon. \"I trust I\u0027m not in the way,\" she said rather coldly, \"but the storm is so violent, and the drifts are forming so fast, that I hope you will not mind my sheltering here.\" Richard was embarrassed. Her fine words disconcerted him. He had often watched Miss Bardon from a respectful distance, but had never spoken to her before. \"You\u0027re welcome, ma\u0027am,\" he replied awkwardly, and offered her his chair. She sat down and held her feet to the brazier. He noticed that her shoes were pulped with wet, and the water was pouring off her skirts to the floor. He did not dare speak, and she evidently did not want to. He felt the colour mounting to his face; he knew that he was dirty and unkempt, for he had been hours in the hut—his hands were grimed from the brazier, and he wore an old crumpled slop. She probably despised him. Suddenly he noticed that the wet of her garments was dropping on the lamb. He hastily gathered it up in his arms. \"What a dear little creature!\" She spoke quite graciously, and Richard felt his spirits revive. \"His mother\u0027s dead, and I have to be looking after him, surelye.\" \"Poor little thing!\" She asked him a few questions about the lambing, then: \"You\u0027re one of Mr. Backfield\u0027s sons, are you not?\" \"Yes, ma\u0027am. I\u0027m Richard.\" \"I\u0027ve seen you before—in church, I think. Are you your father\u0027s shepherd?\" \"Yes, ma\u0027am.\" \"Again I hope I am not in your way. I\u0027ve been over to see the carter\u0027s widow at Socknersh—he died two days ago, you know, and she hasn\u0027t a penny to go on with. Then when I saw the storm coming I thought I would take a short cut home across the fields; I was caught after all—and here I am!\" She smiled suddenly as she finished speaking. It was a sweet smile, rather aloof, but lighting up the whole of her face with a sudden flash of youth and kindness. Richard gazed at her, half fascinated, and mumbled lamely—\"you\u0027re welcome, ma\u0027am.\" She suddenly caught sight of his Latin grammar. \"That\u0027s a strange thing to see in a shepherd\u0027s hand.\" He felt encouraged, for he had wanted her to see the difference between him and an ordinary shepherd, but had been too awkward to show her. \"I\u0027ve had it three months—I can construe a bit of Horace now.\" \"Acquam memento rebus in arduis servare mentem,\" said Anne. \"Onmes eodem cogimen,\" said Richard, and blushed. There was silence, but not of the former discouraging sort. Richard was even bold enough to break it: \"I never knew ladies cud speak Latin.\" \"Some can. I was educated with my brother, you know, and when we construed Horace I was always five or six pages ahead. What made you want to learn Latin?\" \"I want to git out o\u0027 this.\" \"Out of your farm duties, you mean?\" \"Yes.\" \"But surely your father would let you adopt some other profession if he knew you did not like this one?\" Richard shook his head. \"He wants justabout all of us—we\u0027ve got to push on the farm.\" \"Yes—I know he is ambitious, but surely he doesn\u0027t want unwilling helpers.\" \"Oh, he d?an\u0027t mind who it is, so long as the work\u0027s done.\" \"And don\u0027t you care about the farm?\" \"I, ma\u0027am?—no. I want to be a gentleman.\" Anne was growing interested. This farm boy was gloriously unlike others of his kind that she had met. \"And you think that if you learn Latin, it\u0027ll help you be a gentleman someday?\" \"Yes—and Greek, when I\u0027ve adone wud the Latin.\" \"Have you many books?\" \"No—only this one.\" \"Then I must lend you some books.\" Richard flushed with pleasure. After all he was not acquitting himself so badly with this fine lady. They talked together for a few more minutes, the boy trying to clip his speech like hers. He noticed how much shorter and crisper it was than his—while he said \"d?an\u0027t,\" she could say \"don\u0027t\" twice. They were interrupted by the entrance of the Doozes shepherd, accompanied by a swirl of flakeless wind. The old man was astonished and rather scandalised to find Anne Bardon. She looked positively rakish sitting there in her steaming clothes, her hat over one ear, her hair in wisps, and her face more animated and girlish than any of his kind had ever seen it. Old Comfort scraped and mumbled, and fussed over the lamb, which the two Latinists had entirely forgotten. Then Richard, seeing himself free and the sky clear, offered to help her through the drifts to Flightshot. She let him accompany her as far as the edge of the Manor estate, where the going was no longer dangerous. \"Your servant, ma\u0027am,\" he said, as he opened the gate; and she answered classically: \"Vale!\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2094/59410.html","bookId":524,"book":{"id":524,"title":"Sussex Gorse The Story of a Fight","description":"简介： Boarzell Fair had been held every year on Boarzell Moor for as long as the oldest in Peasmarsh could remember.
