Reuben listened in silence save for one ejaculation of \"the dirty bitch!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n David nudged William. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And she asked us particular to say as she\u0027d never regretted the day she left Odiam, or wished herself back there, nuther.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She wur purty s?afe to say that—for who\u0027d have her back, I\u0027d lik to know? Larmentable creature she always wur, spanneling around lik a mangy cat. Always thin and always miserable—I\u0027m glad to be shut of her. But she seemed cheery when you saw her?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Unaccountable cheery—and she drank three bottles of six ale.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Um,\" said Reuben. \\n\\n \\n\\n The boys had one or two secret talks about Caro. She also stimulated that habit of \"thinking\" which their father so thoroughly disapproved of. Somehow their encounter with her, combined with their encounter with Richard, seemed to have modified their enthusiasm for Odiam. They could not help comparing that supper at Newhaven with that dinner at Rye, and wondering if it was true what she had said about Richard having got away in time, whereas she had been too late. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And yet she was glad she\u0027d gone—she\u0027d rather be free too late than not at all.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Bill, do you think that if we stay here, Odiam \u0027ull\u0027 do for us wot it did for Caro?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I d?an\u0027t think so.

We\u0027ve no Miss Bardon to trouble about us—reckon we\u0027d come to grief like Albert.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Maybe we would.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2094/59488.html","bookId":524,"book":{"id":524,"title":"Sussex Gorse The Story of a Fight","description":"简介： Boarzell Fair had been held every year on Boarzell Moor for as long as the oldest in Peasmarsh could remember.
