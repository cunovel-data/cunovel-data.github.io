{"id":21384,"no":133,"title":"Chapter 8","content":"Reuben did not go to the Fair that autumn—there being no reason why he should and several why he shouldn\u0027t. He went instead to see Richard, who was down for a week\u0027s rest after a tiring case. Reuben thought a dignified aloofness the best attitude to maintain towards his son—there was no need for them to be on bad terms, but he did not want anyone to imagine that he approved of Richard or thought his success worth while. Richard, for his part, felt kindly disposed towards his father, and a little sorry for him in his isolation. He invited him to dinner once or twice, and, realising his picturesqueness, was not ashamed to show him to his friends. There were several of his friends at Starcliffe that afternoon—men and women rising in the worlds of literature, law, and politics. It was possible that Richard would contend the Rye division—in the Liberal interest, be it said with shame—and he was anxious to surround himself with those who might be useful to him. Besides, he was one of those men who breathe more freely in an atmosphere of Culture. Apart from mere utilitarian questions, he liked to talk over the latest books, the latest cause célèbre or diplomatic coup d\u0027état. Anne, very upright, very desiccated, poured out tea, and Reuben noted with satisfaction that Nature had beaten her at the battle of the [Pg 458]dressing-table. Richard, on the other hand, in spite of an accentuation of the legal profile, looked young for his age and rather buckish, and rumour credited him with an intrigue with a lady novelist. He received his father very kindly, giving him a seat close to the table so that he might have a refuge for his cup and saucer, and introducing him to a gentleman who, he said, was writing a book on Sussex commons and anxious for information about Boarzell. \"But I owe you a grudge, Mr. Backfield, for you have entirely spoilt one of the finest commons in Sussex. The records of Boarzell go back to the twelfth century, and in the Visitations of Sussex it is referred to as a fine piece of moorland three hundred acres in extent and grown over with heather and gorse. I went to see it yesterday, and found only a tuft of gorse and firs at the top.\" \"And they\u0027re coming out this week,\" said Reuben triumphantly. \"Can\u0027t I induce you to spare them? There are only too few of those ancient landmarks left in Sussex.\" \"And there\u0027d be fewer still, if I had the settling of \u0027em. I\u0027d lik to see the whole of England grown over wud wheat from one end to the other.\" \"It would be a shame to spoil all the wild places, though,\" said a vague-looking girl in an embroidered frock, with her hair in a lump at her neck. \"One wants a place where one can get back to Nature,\" said a young man with a pince-nez and open-work socks. \"But my father\u0027s great idea,\" said Richard, \"is that Nature is just a thing for man to tread down and subdue.\" \"It can\u0027t be done,\" said the young man in the open-work socks—\"it can\u0027t be done. And why should we want to do it?—is not Nature the Mother and Nurse of[Pg 459] us all?—and is it not best for us simply to lie on her bosom and trust her for our welfare?\" \"If I\u0027d a-done that,\" said Reuben, \"I shouldn\u0027t have an acre to my n?um, surelye.\" \"And what do you want with an acre? What is an acre but a man\u0027s toy—a child\u0027s silly name for a picture it can\u0027t understand. Have you ever heard Pan\u0027s pipes?\" \"I have not, young man.\" \"Then you know nothing of Nature—the real goddess, many-breasted Ceres. What can you know of the earth, who have never danced to the earth\u0027s music?\" \"I once stayed on the Downs,\" said the girl in the embroidered frock, speaking dreamily, \"and one twilight I seemed to hear elfin music on the hill. I tore off my shoes and let down my hair and I danced—I danced....\" \"Ah,\" said the youth in the open-work socks approvingly. \"That\u0027s very like an episode in \u0027Meryon\u0027s House,\u0027 you know—that glorious scene in which Jennifer the Prostitute goes down to the New Forest with Meryon and suddenly begins dancing in a glade.\" \"Of course, being a prostitute, she\u0027d be closer to Nature than a respectable person.\" \"I thought \u0027Meryon\u0027s House\u0027 the worst bilge this year has given us,\" said a man in a braided coat. \"Or that Meryon has given us, which is saying more,\" put in someone else. \"I hate these romantic realists—they\u0027re worse than the old-fashioned Zola sort.\" The conversation had quite deserted Reuben, who sat silent and forgotten in his corner, thinking what fools all these people were. After he had wondered what they were talking about for a quarter of an hour, he rose to go, and gave a sigh of relief when the fresh air of Iden Hill came rustling to him on the doorstep. \"He\u0027s a fine old fellow, your father, Backfield,\" said the man who was writing a book on Sussex commons. \"I can almost forgive him for spoiling one of the best pieces of wild land in the county.\" \"A magnificent old face,\" said a middle-aged woman with red hair—\"the lining of it reminds me of those interesting Italian peasants one meets—they wrinkle more beautifully than a young girl keeps her bloom. I should like to paint him.\" \"So should I,\" said the girl in the embroidered frock—\"and I\u0027ve been taking note of his clothes for our Earlscourt Morris Dancers.\" Richard felt almost proud of his parent. \"He\u0027s certainly picturesque—and really there\u0027s a good deal of truth in what he says about having got the better of Nature. Thirty years ago I\u0027d have sworn he could never have done it. But it\u0027s my firm conviction that he has—and made a good job of it too. He\u0027s fought like the devil, he\u0027s been hard on every man and himself into the bargain, he\u0027s worked like a slave, and never given in. The result is that he\u0027s done what I\u0027d have thought no man could possibly do. It\u0027s really rather splendid of him.\" \"Ah—but he\u0027s never heard Pan\u0027s pipes,\" said the youth in the open-work socks.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2094/59505.html","bookId":524,"book":{"id":524,"title":"Sussex Gorse The Story of a Fight","description":"简介： Boarzell Fair had been held every year on Boarzell Moor for as long as the oldest in Peasmarsh could remember.
