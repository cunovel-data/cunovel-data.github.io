{"id":21335,"no":84,"title":"Chapter 16","content":"When late the next morning a woman ran out of the house into the cow-stable, and told Reuben that his wife had given him a fine boy, he merely groaned and shook his head. \n \n He sat on a stool at the foot of Brindle\u0027s stall, and watched her as she lay there, slobbering her straw. His face was grim and furrowed, lines scored it from nose to mouth and across the forehead; his hair was damp and rough on his temples, his eyes were dull with sleeplessness. \n \n \"W?an\u0027t yer have summat t\u0027eat, m?aster?\" asked Beatup, looking in. \n \n All Reuben said was: \n \n \"Has the Inspector come?\" \n \n \"No, master—I\u0027ll bring him r?ound soon as he does. W?an\u0027t you have a bite o\u0027 cheese if I fetch it?\" \n \n Reuben shook his head. \n \n \"M?aster——\" continued the man after a pause. \n \n \"Well?\" \n \n \"I hear as how it\u0027s a liddle son....\" \n \n Reuben mumbled something inarticulate, and Beatup took himself off. His master\u0027s head fell between his clenched hands, and as the cow gave a sudden slavering cough in the straw, a shudder passed over his skin, and he hunched himself more despairingly. \n \n Odiam had triumphed at last. Just when Reuben\u0027s unsettled allegiance should have been given entirely to the wife who had borne him a son, his farm had suddenly snatched from him all his thought, all his care, his love, and his anxiety, all that should have been hers. It seemed almost as if some malignant spirit had controlled events, and for Rose\u0027s stroke prepared a counter-stroke that should effectually drive her off the field. The same evening that Rose had gone weeping and shuddering upstairs, Reuben had interviewed the vet. from Rye and heard him say \"excema epizootica.\" This had not conveyed much, so the vet. had translated brutally: \n \n \"Foot-and-mouth disease.\" \n \n The most awful of a farmer\u0027s dooms had fallen on Reuben. The new Contagious Diseases of Animals Act made it more than probable that all his herd would have to be slaughtered. Of course, there would be a certain amount of compensation, but government compensation was never adequate, and with the multitudinous expenses of disinfecting and cleansing he was likely to sustain some crippling losses, just when every penny was vital to Odiam. He knew of a man who had been ruined by an outbreak of pleuro-pneumonia, of another who had been forced by swine-fever to sell half his farm. Besides, any hope of a deal over his milk-round was now at an end. His dairy business, whether in town or country, was destroyed, and his reputation would be probably as unjustly damaged, so that he would not be able to adventure on that road for years—perhaps never again. \n \n Small wonder, then, that the birth of a son brought no joy. The child was born to an inheritance of shame, the heir of disaster. Reuben\u0027s head bowed nearly to his knees. He felt old and broken. He began to see that it was indeed dreadfully possible that he had thriven all these years, conquered waste lands, and enriched fat lands, only to be overthrown at last by a mere arbitrary piece of ill-luck. How the disease had broken out he could not tell—he had bought no foreign cattle, indeed recently he had bought no cattle at all. He could not blame himself in the smallest degree; it was just a malignant capricious thrust—as if fate had wanted to show him that what had taken him years of labour and battle and sacrifice to build up, could be destroyed in as many days. \n \n A little hope sustained him till the Inspector\u0027s visit—the vet. might have been mistaken, the Inspector might not order a wholesale destruction. But these faint sparks were soon extinguished. The loathed epidemic had undoubtedly lifted up its head at Odiam, and Reuben\u0027s entire herd of Jersey, Welsh, and Sussex cattle was doomed to slaughter. \n \n The next few days were like a horrible jumbled nightmare, something malignant, preposterous, outside experience. Three men came over from the slaughterhouse at Rye, and plied their dreadful work till evening. The grey and dun-coloured Jerseys with their mild, protruding eyes, the sturdy Welsh with their little lumpy horns, the Sussex all coloured like a home-county landscape in reds and greys and browns—bowed their meek heads under the ox-killer, and became mere masses of meat and horn and hide. Profitless masses, too, for all the carcases were ordered to be burned. \n \n The nightmare had its appropriate ending. Sixty[Pg 297] dead beasts were burned in lime. Boarzell became Hinnom—it was the most convenient open space, so Reuben\u0027s herd was burned on it. From a dozen different pyres streamers of white smoke flew along the wind, and a strange terrible smell and tickling of the nostrils troubled the labourer on the westward lands by Flightshot or Moor\u0027s Cottage. \n \n The neighbourhood sat up in thrilled dismay, and watched Odiam pass through its hour. The farm was shut off from civilisation by a barrier of lime—along every road that flanked it, outside every gate that opened on it, the stuff of fiery purification was spread. The fields with their ripening oats and delicately browned wheat, the orchards where apples trailed the boughs into the grass, the snug red house, and red and brown barns, the black, turrets of the oasts, all cried \"Unclean! Unclean!\" \n \n Odiam was a leper. None might leave it without rubbing his boots in lime, no beasts could be driven beyond its hedges. More, the curse afflicted the guiltless—the markets at Rye and Battle were forbidden, the movements of cattle were restricted, and Coalbran once indignantly showed Reuben a certificate which he found he must have ready to produce every time he moved his single cow across the lane from the hedge pasture to the stream fallow. \n \n Public opinion was against Backfield, and blamed him surlily for the local inconvenience. \n \n \"D?an\u0027t tell me,\" said Coalbran in the bar, \"as it wurn\u0027t his fault. Foot-and-mouth can\u0027t just drop from heaven. He must have bought some furriners, and they\u0027ve carried it wud \u0027em, surelye.\" \n \n \"Serve un right,\" said Ticehurst. \n \n \"Still, I\u0027m sorry for him,\" said Realf of Grandturzel—\"he\u0027s the only man hereabouts wot\u0027s really made a serious business of farming, and it\u0027s a shame he should get busted.\" \n \n \"He ?un\u0027t busted yet,\" said Coalbran. \n \n \"But you mark my words, he will be,\" said Ticehurst; \"anyways I shud lik him to be, fur he\u0027s a high-stomached man, and only deserves to be put down.\" \n \n \"He\u0027s down enough now, surelye! I saw him only yesterday by the Glotten meadows, and there was a look in his eye as I\u0027ll never forget.\" \n \n \"And yit he\u0027s as proud as the Old Un himself. I met him on Thursday, and I told him how unaccountable sorry we all wur fur him, and he jest spat.\" \n \n \"I offered to help him wud his burning,\" said Realf, \"and he said as he\u0027d see me and my lousy farm burnt first.\" \n \n \"He\u0027s a tedious contradictious old feller—he desarves all he\u0027s got. Let\u0027s git up a subscription fur him—that ud cut him to the heart, and he wudn\u0027t t?ake it, so it ud cost us naun, nuther.\" \n \n The rest of the bar seemed to think, however, that Reuben might take the money out of spite, so Coalbran\u0027s charitable suggestion collapsed for lack of support. \n \n Meantime, so fast bound in the iron of his misery that he scarcely felt the prick of tongues, Reuben lived through the final stages of his nightmare—those final stages of shock and upheaval when the fiery torment of the dream dies down into the ashes of waking. He wandered over his land in his lime-caked boots, scarcely talking to those at work on it, directing with mere mechanical activity the labour which now seemed to him nothing but the writhings of a crushed beetle. Everyone felt a little afraid of him, everyone avoided him as much as possible—he was alone. \n \n His nostrils were always full of the smart of lime, and the stench of those horrible furnaces belching away on the slopes of the Moor. Would that burning never be done? For days the yellowy white pennons of destruction had flown on Boarzell, and that acrid reek polluted[Pg 299] the harvest wind. Boarzell was nothing but a huge funeral pyre, a smoking hell.... \"And the smoke of her went up for ever and ever.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2094/59456.html","bookId":524,"book":{"id":524,"title":"Sussex Gorse The Story of a Fight","description":"简介： Boarzell Fair had been held every year on Boarzell Moor for as long as the oldest in Peasmarsh could remember.
