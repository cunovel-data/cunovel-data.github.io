It was late in the afternoon, the sunlight had gone, and a wintry twilight crept up the wall. Maude the dairy-woman was looking in at the door. \n \n \"Wot is it? Wot\u0027s happened?\" \n \n \"Boorman asked me to fetch you. They\u0027ve had some vrother wud the young Squire, and he\u0027s shot a cow.\" \n \n \"Shot one of my cows!\" and Reuben sprang to his feet. \"Where woman? Where?\" \n \n \"Down at Totease. He wur the wuss for liquor, I reckon.\" \n \n Reuben was out of the house bare-headed, and running across the yard to the Totease meadows. He soon met a little knot of farm-hands coming towards him, with three rather guilty-looking young men. \n \n \"Wot\u0027s happened?\" he called to Boorman. \n \n \"Only this, m?aster—Dunk and me found Mus\u0027 Fleet a-tearing about the Glotten meadow wud two of his friends, trying to fix Radical posters on the cows—seems as they\u0027d r?aked up one or two o\u0027 them old Ben the Gorilla posters wot used to be about Peasmarsh, and they\u0027d stuck one on Tawny and one on Cowslip, and wur fair racing the other beasts to death. Then when me and the lads c?ame up and interfere, they want to fight us—and when we t?ake h?ald of \u0027em, seeing as they \u0027pear to be a liddle the wuss for drink, why Mus\u0027 Fleet he pulls out a liddle pistol and shoots all around, and hits poor ?ald Dumpling twice over.\" \n \n \"Look here, farmer,\" said one of the young men—\"we\u0027re awfully sorry, and we\u0027ll settle with you about that cow. We were only having a rag. We\u0027re awfully sorry.\" \n \n \"Ho, indeed! I\u0027m glad to hear it. And you\u0027ll settle wud me about the cow! Wur it you who shot her, I\u0027d lik to know?\" \n \n \"I didn\u0027t actually fire the pistol—but we\u0027re all in the same boat. Had a luncheon over at Rye to cheer ourselves up after seeing the Tory get in. We\u0027re awfully sorry.\" \n \n \"You\u0027ve said that afore,\" said Reuben. \n \n He pondered sternly over the three young men, who[Pg 452] all looked sober enough now. As a matter of fact, Dumpling was no great loss; fifteen pounds would have paid for her. But he was not disposed to let off George Fleet so easily. Against the two other youths he bore no grudge—they were just ordinary ineffective young asses, of Radical tendencies, he noted grimly. George, however, stood on a different footing; he was the mocker of Odiam, the perpetrator of many gross and silly practical jokes at its expense. He should not escape with the mere payment of fifteen pounds, for he owed Reuben the punishment of his earlier misdeeds. \n \n \"The man as shot my cow shall answer fur it before the magistrate,\" he said severely. \n \n \"Look here——\" cried George Fleet, and his two friends began to bid for mercy, starting with twenty pounds. \n \n \"Be a sport,\" pleaded one of them, when they had come to forty, \"you simply can\u0027t hand him over to the police—his father\u0027s Squire of the Manor, and it would be no end of a scandal.\" \n \n \"I know who his f?ather is, thank\u0027ee,\" said Reuben. \n \n Then suddenly a great, a magnificent, a triumphant idea struck him. He nearly staggered under the force of it. He was like a general who sees what he had looked upon hitherto as a mere trivial skirmish develop into a battle which may win him the whole campaign. He spoke almost faintly. \n \n \"Someone go fur the Squire.\" \n \n \"Sir Eustace!\" \n \n \"Yes—fetch him here, and I\u0027ll talk the matter over wud him.\" \n \n \"But——\" \n \n \"Either you fetch him here or I send fur the police.\" \n \n The two young men stared at each other, then George Fleet nodded to them: \n \n \"You\u0027d better go. The dad\u0027ll be better than a[Pg 453] policeman anyhow. Try and smooth him down a bit on the way.\" \n \n \"Right you are\"—and they reluctantly moved off, leaving their comrade in the enemy\u0027s hands. \n \n However, Reuben\u0027s whole manner had changed. His attitude towards George Fleet became positively cordial. He took him into the kitchen, and made Maude give him some tea. He himself paced nervously up and down, a queer look of exaltation sometimes passing over his face. One would never have taken him for the same man as the old fellow who an hour ago had huddled weak and almost senile in his chair, broken under his life\u0027s last tragedy. He felt young, strong, energetic, a soldier again. \n \n The Squire soon arrived. Reuben had him shown into the parlour, and insisted on seeing him alone. \n \n \"You finish your tea,\" he said to George, \"and bring some more, Maudie, for these gentlemen,\" nodding kindly to the two young men, who stared at him as if they thought he had taken leave of his senses. \n \n In the parlour, Sir Eustace greeted him with mingled nervousness and irritation. \n \n \"Well, Backfield, I\u0027m sorry about this young scapegrace of mine. But boys will be boys, you know, and we\u0027ll make it all right about that cow. I promise you it won\u0027t happen again.\" \n \n \"I\u0027m sorry to have given you the trouble of coming here, Squire. But I thought maybe you and I cud come to an arrangement wudout calling in the police.\" \n \n \"Oh, certainly, certainly. You surely wouldn\u0027t think of doing that, Backfield. I promise you the full value of the cow.\" \n \n \"Quite so, Squire. But it ?un\u0027t the cow as I\u0027m vrothered about so much as these things always happening. This ?un\u0027t the first \u0027rag,\u0027 as he calls it, wot he\u0027s had on my farm. I\u0027ve complained to you before.\" \n \n \"I know you have, and I promise you nothing of this kind shall ever happen again.\" \n \n \"How am I to know that, Squire? You can\u0027t kip the young man in a prammylator. Now if he wur had up before the magistrate and sent to prison, it \u0027ud be a lesson as he\u0027d never disremember.\" \n \n \"But think of me, Backfield! Think of his mother! Think of us all! It would be a ghastly thing for us. I promise to pay you the full value of the cow—and of your damaged self-respect into the bargain. Won\u0027t that content you?\" \n \n \"Um,\" said Reuben—\"it might.\" \n \n The Squire thought he had detected Backfield\u0027s little game, and a relieved affability crept into his manner. \n \n \"That\u0027ll be all right,\" he said urbanely. \"Of course I understand your feelings are more important to you than your cow. We\u0027ll do our best to meet you. What do you value them at, eh?\" \n \n \"The Fair-pl?ace.\" \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2094/59503.html","bookId":524,"book":{"id":524,"title":"Sussex Gorse The Story of a Fight","description":"简介： Boarzell Fair had been held every year on Boarzell Moor for as long as the oldest in Peasmarsh could remember.
