{"id":21317,"no":66,"title":"Chapter 14","content":"It would be mere politeness to describe as a \"taking\" Reuben\u0027s condition when he heard Richard had gone. He was in a stamping, bellowing, bloodshot rage. He sent for various members of his family, questioned them, stormed at them, sent them away, then sent for them again. He boxed Caro\u0027s ears because she cried—hitherto he had kept his hands off the girls. As for Tilly, he would have liked to have whipped her—he felt sure that somehow it was all her doing—but the more furious he grew, the more he felt himself abashed by her manner, at once so soft and so determined, and he dared do no more than throw his boots at her. After a night of cursings and trampings in his room, he took the fermenting dregs of his wrath to Cheat Land. It was queer that he should go for sympathy to Alice Jury, who was chief in the enemy\u0027s camp. But[Pg 231] though he knew she would not take his part, she would not be like the others, leering and cackling. She would give him something vital, even if it was only a vital opposition. That was all the difference between her and everyone else—she opposed him not because she was flabby or uninterested or enterpriseless, but because she really hated what he strove for. She was his one strong candid enemy, so he went to her as his only friend. She was shocked at his white twitching face and bloodshot eyes; for the first time since she had known him, Reuben came to her bereft of that triumphant manhood which had made him so splendid to watch in his struggles. \"The hound!\" he cried, striking his fists together, \"the miserable, cowardy hound!—gone and left me—gone to be a gentleman, the lousy pig. Oh, Lard, I wish as I had him in these hands o\u0027 mine!—I\u0027d m?ake a gentleman of him!\" Alice, as he expected, had caustic for him rather than balm. \"Once again,\" she said slowly, \"I ask you—is it worth while?\" \"Wot\u0027s worth while?\" \"You know. I asked you that question the first or second time I saw you. No one had ever asked it you before, and you would have liked to beat me.\" \"I shud like to beat you now—talking of wot you know naun about.\" \"I daresay—but I\u0027m not your son or your daughter or your wife——\" \"I never beat my wife.\" \"Chivalrous, humane man!—well, anyhow I\u0027m not anyone you can beat, so I dare ask—is it worth while?\" \"And I ask wot d\u0027you mean by \u0027worth while\u0027?\" \"You know that it\u0027s Boarzell and your farm which have lost you your boys.\" \"I know nothing of the sort.\" \"Well, would Robert have stolen money, or Albert disgraced your name, to get free, if you and your farm hadn\u0027t made them slaves? If you hadn\u0027t been a heartless slave-driver would George have died the other night alone on the Moor?—or would Richard have taken advantage of a neighbour\u0027s charity to escape from you? Don\u0027t you see that your ambition has driven you to make slaves of your children?\" \"Well, they w?an\u0027t wark fur me of their free will. Lard knows I\u0027ve tried to interest \u0027em....\" \"But how can you expect them to be interested? Your ambition means nothing to them.\" \"It ought to—Odiam\u0027s their home jest as it\u0027s mine.\" \"But don\u0027t you see that you\u0027ve forced them to give up all the sweet things of life for it?—Robert his love, and Albert his poetry, and Richard his education.\" \"Well, I gave up all the sweet things of life, as you call \u0027em—and why shudn\u0027t they?\" \"Because you gave those things up of your free will—they were made to give them up by force. You\u0027ve no right to starve and deny other people as you have to starve and deny yourself.\" \"I d?an\u0027t see that. Wot I can do, they can.\" \"But—as experience has taught you—they won\u0027t. You can see now what your slave-driving\u0027s brought you to—you\u0027ve lost your slaves.\" \"Well, and I reckon they wurn\u0027t much loss, nuther\"—the caustic was healing after all—\"Robert wur a fool wot didn\u0027t know how to steal a ten-pound note, Albert wur always mooning and wasting his time, and George wur a pore thing not worth his keep. As for Richard—that Richard—who wants a stuck-up, dentical, high-nosed, genteel swell about the pl?ace? I reckon as I\u0027m well shut of the whole four of \u0027em. They wurn\u0027t worth the food they ate, surelye!\" \"That\u0027s what strikes me as so pathetic.\" \"Wot?\" \"That you should be able to comfort yourself with the thought that they weren\u0027t worth much to you as a farmer. What were they worth to you as a father?\" \"Naun.\" \"Quite so—and that\u0027s what makes me pity you,\" and suddenly her eyes kindled, blazed, as with her spirit itself for fuel—\"I pity you, I pity you—poor, poor man!\" \"Adone do wud that—though you sound more as if you wur in a black temper wud me than as if you pitied me.\" \"I am angry with you just because I pity you. It\u0027s a shame that I should have to pity you—you\u0027re such a splendid man. It ought to be impossible to pity you, but I do—I pity you from my soul. Think what you\u0027re missing. Think what your children might have been to you. How you might have loved that dear stupid Robert—how proud you might have been of Albert, and of Richard leaving you for a professional career ... and poor little George, just because he was weak and unlike the rest, he might have been more to you than them all. Then there\u0027s your brother Harry——\" \"Come, come—stick to the truth. I ?un\u0027t to blame for Harry.\" \"But can\u0027t you see that he\u0027s the chief part of the tragedy you\u0027re bringing on yourself and everyone?—He\u0027s the type, he\u0027s the chorus, the commentary on every act. Reuben, can\u0027t you see—oh, why won\u0027t you see?—he\u0027s you, yourself, as you really are!\" \"Nonsense!—d?an\u0027t be a fool, my gal.\" \"Yes—you—blind, crazy with your ambition, repulsive and alone in it. Don\u0027t you see?\" He smiled grimly—\"I d?an\u0027t.\" \"No—you don\u0027t see this hideous thing that\u0027s pursuing you, that\u0027s stripping you of all that ought to be yours, that\u0027s making you miss a hundred beautiful[Pg 234] things, that\u0027s driving you past all your joys—this Boarzell....\" \"—?un\u0027t driving me, anyhow. I\u0027m fighting it.\" \"No,\" said Alice. \"It\u0027s I who am fighting Boarzell.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2094/59438.html","bookId":524,"book":{"id":524,"title":"Sussex Gorse The Story of a Fight","description":"简介： Boarzell Fair had been held every year on Boarzell Moor for as long as the oldest in Peasmarsh could remember.
