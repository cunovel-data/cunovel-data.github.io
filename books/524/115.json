{"id":21366,"no":115,"title":"Chapter 7","content":"That autumn David and William went to Newhaven to see the Rye Football Club play the West Sussex United. They had more than once gone on such jaunts together, and on this occasion, trains being difficult, they put up for the night at a small hotel near the port. It was the first time they had spent a night away from Odiam, and a certain thrill attached to it. \\n\\n \\n\\n When the match was over they went for a stroll on the parade. There was not much daylight left, but the evening was warm, and the parade was crowded with saunterers. The young men were glad to think that there was no homeward train to be caught, or account of the day\u0027s doings to be given to their father. He always asked minutely how they spent their time, and it annoyed them a little. \\n\\n \\n\\n To-night they would walk and sit on the parade till supper time, then go to some coffee-house, and wind up at a music-hall. It was a gay programme and they discussed it happily, glanced at the passers-by, inspected the empty bandstand, and finally sat down on one of the seats to watch the fishing-boats trim their lamps in the amethyst fog of the sea. For some time they talked about the terrible licking the United had given Rye, arguing about this or that player, and speculating as to what would be the Club\u0027s fate at Hythe next week. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was David who drew William\u0027s attention to the woman sitting at the other end of their seat. David piqued himself on his knowledge of the world. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She\u0027s a—you know,\" he said. \\n\\n \\n\\n William peeped round his brother\u0027s shoulder. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How can you tell?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, you kid, it\u0027s as plain as the nose on your face—look at her paint.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Bill looked, his eyes opening wider than ever. She[Pg 401] certainly was a disreputable female, or there was no judging by appearances. She wore a big frowsy hat trimmed with roses and ears of corn, under which her thick black hair was held up by several tawdry pins; her face was more lavishly than artistically adorned with rouge and blanc de perle, and she pulled a cape of lavender velvet closely round her shoulders as if she were cold—which might well have been, for, as far as they could see, her bodice consisted almost entirely of lace. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s early for her to be prowling,\" said the man of the world. \"I reckon she\u0027s having just a breath of fresh air before she starts work.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Where\u0027ll she go then?\" asked Billy. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, to the more crowded streets, round about the pubs and that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I wonder how much she m?akes at it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not much, I reckon. She\u0027s a very low-class sort, and not at all young.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"T?ake care—she might hear you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, don\u0027t you worry,\" said the lady blandly; \"I like listening to you, and I was only waiting till you\u0027d stopped before I introduced myself.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Bill gasped, and David forgot that he was a man of the world, and sidled against his brother. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you know me?\" continued the siren, tilting her hat back from her face. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No-o-o.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ever heard of your sister Caro?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Both boys started, and stared at her in utter blankness. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, it wasn\u0027t to be expected as you\u0027d recognise me. You were only little boys, and I\u0027ve changed a bit. Maybe I shouldn\u0027t have spoken to you—got no decent feelings, some people would say; but I justabout couldn\u0027t help it. I heard you call each other David and Bill, and talk about Odiam and that, so I\u0027d have known[Pg 402] you even if you hadn\u0027t been the dead spit of your father.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The boys still didn\u0027t seem to have much to say, so she continued: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I heard of your brother Pete the other day—never knew he\u0027d left home till I saw his name down to preach at Piddinghoe Mission Hall last month. He\u0027s called Salvation Pete now, as I daresay you know, and I half thought of going to hear him, only times are so bad I couldn\u0027t afford an evening off. When did he leave Odiam?—I should like some news of home.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He quitted years ago, when we were little chaps. Salvation got him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I reckon that must have come hard on f?ather—he always was unaccountable set on Pete. Heard anything of Tilly lately?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, nothing particular. But f?ather\u0027s going to buy the Grandturzel inclosure.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And Rose?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Who\u0027s Rose?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Your mother, my precious innocents. But look here, you shall ask me to supper—it\u0027ll only be doing the decent thing by me—and you shall tell me about them all at Odiam—as used to be at Odiam, rather, for I reckon there\u0027s nobody but yourselves there now.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n David and William looked at each other uneasily; however, there was nothing else to be done, and also a certain excitement and curiosity inspired them. So they set out with Caro to an eating-house chosen by herself in a small fish-smelling back street. They were much too embarrassed to order supper, so Caro good-naturedly did this for them—fish and chips, and three bottles of six ale. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t often come here,\" she said—\"this is a bit too classy for me. I go mostly to the coffee stalls down by the harbour. You mustn\u0027t think as I\u0027m coining money at this, you know. I work mostly among the[Pg 403] fishermen, and they\u0027re a seedy lot. I started up town, but I\u0027m not so young as I was, and sometimes even at the harbour I find it unaccountable hard to git off.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n With the gas-light flaring on her raddled face, showing up mercilessly the tawdriness and shoddiness of her clothes, which reeked of a cheap scent, the boys did not find it hard to believe that she often had a struggle to \"git off \"—indeed, it was a mystery how any man, however unfastidious, however fuddled, could kiss or take kisses from this bundle of rags and bones and paint. Caro seemed to notice the disparaging look. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, I\u0027m a bit off colour to-night, but I can tell you I was a fine girl when I went away with Joe—and all the time I lived with him, too, first at the Camber and then at New Romney; there was many as \u0027ud have been proud to git me from him. But I stuck to him faithful, I did, till one morning I woke up and found him gone, off on a voyage to Australia—wonder if he met Robert—having given me over to a pal of his for five pounds and a set of oilskins. Oh, I can tell you I took on something awful—I wasn\u0027t used to men in those days. But Joe\u0027s pal he was a decent chap—there was nothing the matter with him save that he wasn\u0027t Joe. He was unaccountable good to me, and I stayed with him three years—and then I hooked it, scarcely knew why. I got a post as barmaid in Seaford, but the landlord took up with me and his missus chucked me out. And now I\u0027m here.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Have—have you been here long?\" stammered David, feeling he must say something. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Three year or so. I started up town. But we\u0027ve spoken enough about me. Let\u0027s hear about you, and the farm. How\u0027s Richard?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The boys told her; they described their prosperous brother with his white shirt-front, his pince-nez, his ring, and his high-born wife. As they talked they grew more at their ease. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well,\" said Caro, \"I reckon he got away in time.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"From what?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"From Odiam, of course. I stayed too long. I stayed till I was half killed by the place. If I\u0027d gone off as a young girl I reckon I\u0027d have done well by myself, but I waited on till I was ready to take anything that was going, and when you\u0027re like that it\u0027s too late.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I shouldn\u0027t think Richard was sorry he left.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No—and mark you, nor am I. It \u0027ud have been worse for me if I\u0027d stayed. I\u0027m miserable in a different way from what I was there—somehow the life\u0027s easier. I\u0027m not happy, but I\u0027m jolly. I\u0027m not good, but I\u0027m pleasant-like. It\u0027s all a change for the better. See?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then you don\u0027t wish as you wur back again?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Back! Back with f?ather! Not me! Now let\u0027s hear some more about him—does he ever speak to you of your mother?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n For the rest of the meal they discussed the absent ones—Rose, Robert, Albert, Benjamin, Tilly, the boys hearing a great deal that had never come to their ears before. Caro ordered two more bottles of six, and in the end the party became quite convivial, and David and William, forgetting the strangeness of it all, were sorry when their sister at last stood up and announced that she must wobble off or she\u0027d be late. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027ll tell father you met me?\" she said as they left the eating-house. \\n\\n \\n\\n David and William looked at each other, and hesitated. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027ve no call to be ashamed of me,\" said Caro rather irritably. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We—we ?un\u0027t ashamed of you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s right—for you\u0027ve no call to be. I was driven to this, couldn\u0027t help myself. Besides, I\u0027m no worse than a lot of women wot you call respectable—at least, I put some sort of a price on myself, if it\u0027s only five shillings. Now good night, young men, and thank you[Pg 405] for a very pleasant evening. I don\u0027t suppose as you\u0027ll ever see me again. And mind—you tell father as, no matter the life I lead and the knocks I get, I\u0027ve never once, not once, regretted the day I ran off from his old farm. Now mind—you tell him that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2094/59487.html","bookId":524,"book":{"id":524,"title":"Sussex Gorse The Story of a Fight","description":"简介： Boarzell Fair had been held every year on Boarzell Moor for as long as the oldest in Peasmarsh could remember.
