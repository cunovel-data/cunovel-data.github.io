{"id":21358,"no":107,"title":"Chapter 14","content":"Early in May, Pete came out to Reuben on Boarzell and told him that Albert was dead. Reuben felt a little awkward and a little relieved. \"He died quiet, I hope?\" \"Oh, yes,\" said Pete, \"he laid hold on the merits of Jesus.\" Reuben started. \"It wur a pr?aper death,\" continued Pete; \"his soul wur washed as white as wool. He wur the prodigal son come h?ame; he wur the Lord\u0027s lost sixpence, I reckon.\" \"And that son of a harlot from Little Bethel wurn\u0027t wud him, I trust?\" \"No, I\u0027m going to fetch him now.\" His father opened his mouth to forbid him angrily, but changed his mind and said nothing. Pete walked off whistling—\"When the cleansing Blood is poured.\" Reuben could not help feeling relieved at Albert\u0027s death, but he had noticed with some alarm Pete\u0027s definitely religious phraseology. He hoped that Ades had not corrupted him from his pure churchmanship, the honourable churchmanship of the Backfields. Being[Pg 376] a Dissenter was only one degree better than being a Liberal, and Reuben swore to keep a firm hand over Pete in future. That evening he and his son had their first conflict. Pete announced that he had made arrangements with Ades for Albert\u0027s funeral, and Reuben announced with equal conviction that he was hemmed if Ades had any truck in it wotsumdever. Albert should be buried according to the rites and ceremonies of the Church of England, he wasn\u0027t going to have any salvation sung over his grave. Pete, on the other hand, stuck to his point, and alarmed Reuben with more religious phraseology. \"It wur Ades wot gave him to the Lord, wot found him salvation in the Blood of the Lamb.\" \"I d?an\u0027t care two straws about that. Albert wur born and christened Church, and he\u0027s not going to die chapel because a lousy Methody sings hymns over him when he\u0027s sick and d?an\u0027t know better. If I find that feller on my pl?ace again, I\u0027ll break every bone in his body.\" Pete angrily defended the minister, which caused Reuben fresh alarm; for in the old days when his father abused Ades he had tried to conciliate him by laying stress on the latter\u0027s prowess as a bruiser, but now he never once mentioned his fists, enlarging instead on his qualities of soul and on the fact that he had found Christ. The two theologians carried on their argument till well past bedtime, and at last separated in a great state of dogma and indignation. In the end it was the Church that won. Reuben went over early the next morning to the Rectory, and made arrangements for Albert\u0027s funeral on the following Monday. He enlarged on the conflict he had had with Pete, and was a little dashed by the rector\u0027s want of enthusiasm. Albert was buried with all the decent rites of the[Pg 377] Establishment. He was laid to rest in the Christian company of his mother and his brother George, at the bottom of the churchyard where it touched the pond; a little way from him was the old yeoman who had \"never wanted anything he hadn\u0027t got, and so hadn\u0027t got anything he didn\u0027t want.\" It relieved Pete a little to think that from where he lay his brother could not see Boarzell—\"not even if he sat up in his grave.\" The funeral was dignified and impressive, and every now and then Reuben glanced across at his son with eyes that said—\"Wot could Ebenezer have done compared wud this?\" All the same, he was disappointed. Somehow he had expected his churchmanship to strike the rector and the curate very favourably; he had expected them metaphorically to fall on his neck; he saw himself as a champion of established Christendom, of tithes and glebes and cosy rectories and \"dearly beloved brethren\" on Sundays. It was humiliating to find himself ignored, indeed treated as an outsider, simply because he had not been to church for ten years. He had had his children baptised into the Establishment, and now he was burying his son according to its rites, in spite of opposition, even persecution. These parsons were ungrateful, bigoted, and blind. Perhaps though, he thought, their behaviour was partially accounted for by that of Pete, who stood beside the grave with his eyes shut, saying \"A-aaa-men\" at unliturgical intervals, as only Dissenters can say it.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2094/59479.html","bookId":524,"book":{"id":524,"title":"Sussex Gorse The Story of a Fight","description":"简介： Boarzell Fair had been held every year on Boarzell Moor for as long as the oldest in Peasmarsh could remember.
