{"id":16297,"no":31,"title":"CHAPTER XXXI. BEGINNING ANOTHER LIFE.","content":"IT was hard for the company of rejoicing friends, at the hotel in Magnolia, to part from each other. Mr. Blessing had tact enough to decline Joseph\u0027s invitation, but he was sorely tempted by Philip\u0027s, in which Madeline heartily joined. Nevertheless, he only wavered for a moment; a mysterious resolution strengthened him, and taking Philip to one side, he whispered:— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Will you allow me to postpone, not relinquish, the pleasure? Thanks! A grave duty beckons,—a task, in short, without which the triumph of to-day would be dramatically incomplete. I must speak in riddles, because this is a case in which a whisper might start the overhanging avalanche; but I am sure you will trust me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of course I will!\" Philip cried, offering his hand. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Foi de Belsain!\" was Mr. Blessing\u0027s proud answer, as he hurried away to reach the train for the city. \\n\\n \\n\\n Joseph looked at Philip, as the horses were brought from the stable, and then at Rachel Miller, who, wrapped in her great crape shawl, was quietly waiting for him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We must not separate all at once,\" said Philip, stepping forward. \"Miss Miller, will you invite my sister and myself to take tea with you this evening?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Philip had become one of Rachel\u0027s heroes; she was sure that Mr. Blessing\u0027s testimony and Joseph\u0027s triumphant acquittal were owing to his exertions. The Asten farm could produce nothing good enough for his entertainment,—that was her only trouble. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do tell me the time o\u0027 day,\" she said to Joseph, as he drove out of town, closely followed by Philip\u0027s light carriage. \"It\u0027s three days in one to me, and a deal more like day after to-morrow morning than this afternoon. Now, a telegraph would be a convenience; I could send word and have chickens killed and picked, against we got there.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Joseph answered her by driving as rapidly as the rough country roads permitted, without endangering horse and vehicle. It was impossible for him to think coherently, impossible to thrust back the single overwhelming prospect of relief and release which had burst upon his life. He dared to admit the fortune which had come to him through death, now that his own innocence of any indirect incitement thereto had been established. The future was again clear before him; and even the miserable discord of the past year began to recede and form only an indistinct background to the infinite pity of the death-scene. Mr. Blessing\u0027s testimony enabled him to look back and truly interpret the last appealing looks, the last broken words; his heart banished the remembrance of its accusations, and retained only—so long as it should beat among living men—a deep and tender commiseration. As for the danger he had escaped, the slander which had been heaped upon him, his thoughts were above the level of life which they touched. He was nearer than he suspected to that only true independence of soul which releases a man from the yoke of circumstances. \\n\\n \\n\\n Rachel Miller humored his silence as long as she thought proper, and then suddenly and awkwardly interrupted it. \"Yes,\" she exclaimed; \"there\u0027s a little of the old currant wine in the cellar-closet! Town\u0027s-folks generally like it, and we used to think it good to stay a body\u0027s stomach for a late meal,—as it\u0027ll be apt to be. But I\u0027ve not asked you how you relished the supper, though Elwood, to be sure, allowed that all was tolerable nice. And I see the Lord\u0027s hand in it, as I hope you do, Joseph; for the righteous is never forsaken. We can\u0027t help rejoice, where we ought to be humbly returning thanks, and owning our unworthiness; but Philip Held is a friend, if there ever was one; and the white hen\u0027s brood, though they are new-fashioned fowls, are plump enough by this time. I disremember whether I asked Elwood to stop—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There he is!\" Joseph interrupted; \"turning the corner of the wood before us! Lucy is with him,—and they must both come!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He drove on rapidly, and soon overtook Elwood\u0027s lagging team. The horse, indeed, had had his own way, and the sound of approaching wheels awoke Elwood from a trance of incredible happiness. Before answering Joseph, he whispered to Lucy:— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What shall we say? It\u0027ll be the heaviest favor I\u0027ve ever been called upon to do a friend.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do it, then!\" she said: \"the day is too blessed to be kept for ourselves alone.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n How fair the valley shone, as they came into it out of the long glen between the hills! What cheer there was, even in the fading leaves; what happy promise in the mellow autumn sky! The gate to the lane stood open; Dennis, with a glowing face, waited for the horse. He wanted to say something, but not knowing how, shook hands with Joseph, and then pretended to be concerned with the harness. Rachel, on entering the kitchen, found her neighbor, Mrs. Bishop, embarked on a full tide of preparation. Two plump fowls, scalded and plucked, lay upon the table! \\n\\n \\n\\n This was too much for Rachel Miller. She had borne up bravely through the trying days, concealing her anxiety lest it might be misinterpreted, hiding even her grateful emotion, to make her faith in Joseph\u0027s innocence seem the stronger; and now Mrs. Bishop\u0027s thoughtfulness was the slight touch under which she gave way. She sat down and cried. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Bishop, with a stew-pan in one hand, while she wiped her sympathetic eyes with the other, explained that her husband had come home an hour before, with the news; and that she just guessed help would be wanted, or leastways company, and so she had made bold to begin; for, though the truth had been made manifest, and the right had been proved, as anybody might know it would be, still it was a trial, and people needed to eat more and better under trials than at any other time. \"You may not feel inclined for victuals; but there\u0027s the danger! A body\u0027s body must be supported, whether or no.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Meanwhile, Joseph and his guests sat on the veranda, in the still, mild air. He drew his chair near to Philip\u0027s, their hands closed upon each other, and they were entirely happy in the tender and perfect manly love which united them. Madeline sat in front, with a nimbus of sunshine around her hair, feeling also the embarrassment of speech at such a moment, yet bravely endeavoring to gossip with Lucy on other matters. But Elwood\u0027s face, so bright that it became almost beautiful, caught her eye: she glanced at Philip, who answered with a smile; then at Lucy, whose cheek bloomed with the loveliest color; and, rising without a word, she went to the latter and embraced her. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then, stretching her hand to Elwood, she said: \"Forgive me, both of you, for showing how glad I am!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Philip!\" Joseph cried, as the truth flashed upon him; \"life is not always unjust! It is we who are impatient.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n They both arose and gave hands of congratulation; and Elwood, though so deeply moved that he scarcely trusted himself to speak, was so frankly proud and happy,—so purely and honestly man in such a sacred moment,—that Lucy\u0027s heart swelled with an equally proud recognition of his feeling. Their eyes met, and no memory of a mistaken Past could ever again come like a cloud across the light of their mutual faith. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The day was blessed already,\" said Philip; \"but this makes it perfect.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n No one knew how the time went by, or could afterwards recall much that was said. Rachel Miller, with many apologies, summoned them to a sumptuous meal; and when the moon hung chill and clear above the creeping mists of the valley, they parted. \\n\\n \\n\\n The next evening, Joseph went to Philip at the Forge. It was well that he should breathe another atmosphere, and dwell, for a little while, within walls where no ghosts of his former life wandered. Madeline, the most hospitably observant of hostesses, seemed to have planned the arrangements solely for his and Philip\u0027s intercourse. The short evening of the country was not half over, before she sent them to Philip\u0027s room, where a genial wood-fire prattled and flickered on the hearth, with two easy-chairs before it. \\n\\n \\n\\n Philip lighted a pipe and they sat down. \"Now, Joseph,\" said he, \"I\u0027ll answer \u0027Yes!\u0027 to the question in your mind.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You have been talking with Bishop, Philip?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No; but I won\u0027t mystify you. As I rode up the valley, I saw you two standing on the hill, and could easily guess the rest. A large estate in this country is only an imaginary fortune. You are not so much of a farmer, Joseph, that it will cut you to the heart and make you dream of ruin to part with a few fields; if you were, I should say get that weakness out of you at once! A man should possess his property, not be possessed by it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You are right,\" Joseph answered; \"I have been fighting against an inherited feeling.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The only question is, will the sale of those fifty acres relieve you of all present embarrassments?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"So far, Philip, that a new mortgage of about half the amount will cover what remains.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Bravo!\" cried Philip. \"This is better than I thought. Mr. Hopeton is looking for sure, steady investments, and will furnish whatever you need. So there is no danger of foreclosure.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Things seem to shape themselves almost too easily now,\" Joseph answered. \"I see the old, mechanical routine of my life coming back: it should be enough for me, but it is not; can you tell me why, Philip?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes: it never was enough. The most of our neighbors are cases of arrested development. Their intellectual nature only takes so many marks, like a horse\u0027s teeth; there is a point early in their lives, where its form becomes fixed. There is neither the external influence, nor the inward necessity, to drive them a step further. They find the Sphinx dangerous, and keep out of her way. Of course, as soon as they passively begin, to accept what is, all that was fluent or plastic in them soon hardens into the old moulds. Now, I am not very wise, but this appears to me to be truth; that life is a grand centrifugal force, forever growing from a wider circle towards one that is still wider. Your stationary men may be necessary, and even serviceable; but to me—and to you, Joseph—there is neither joy nor peace except in some kind of growth.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If we could be always sure of the direction!\" Joseph sighed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s the point!\" Philip eagerly continued. \"If we stop to consider danger in advance, we should never venture a step. A movement is always clear after it has been made, not often before. It is enough to test one\u0027s intention; unless we are tolerably bad, something guides us, and adjusts the consequences of our acts. Why, we are like spiders, in the midst of a million gossamer threads, which we are all the time spinning without knowing it! Who are to measure our lives for us? Not other men with other necessities! and so we come back to the same point again, where I started. Looking back now, can you see no gain in your mistake?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, a gain I can never lose. I begin to think that haste and weakness also are vices, and deserve to be punished. It was a dainty, effeminate soul you found, Philip,—a moral and spiritual Sybarite, I should say now. I must have expected to lie on rose-leaves, and it was right that I should find thorns.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think,\" said Philip, \"the world needs a new code of ethics. We must cure the unfortunate tendencies of some qualities that seem good, and extract the good from others that seem evil. But it would need more than a Luther for such a Reformation. I confess I am puzzled, when I attempt to study moral causes and consequences in men\u0027s lives. It is nothing but a tangle, when I take them collectively. What if each of us were, as I half suspect, as independent as a planet, yet all held together in one immense system? Then the central force must be our close dependence on God, as I have learned to feel it through you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Through me!\" Joseph exclaimed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do you suppose we can be so near each other without giving and taking? Let us not try to get upon a common ground of faith or action: it is a thousand times more delightful to discover that we now and then reach the same point by different paths. This reminds me, Joseph, that our paths ought to separate now, for a while. It is you who should leave,—but only to come back again, \u0027in the fulness of time.\u0027 Heaven knows, I am merciless to myself in recommending it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You are right to try me. It is time that I should know something of the world. But to leave, now—so immediately—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It will make no difference,\" said Philip. \"Whether you go or stay, there will be stories afloat. The bolder plan is the better.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The subject was renewed the next morning at breakfast. Madeline heartily seconded Philip\u0027s counsel, and took a lively part in the discussion. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We were in Europe as children,\" she said to Joseph, \"and I have very clear and delightful memories of the travel.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I was not thinking especially of Europe,\" he answered. \"I am hardly prepared for such a journey. What I should wish is, not to look idly at sights and shows, but to have some active interest or employment, which would bring me into contact with men. Philip knows my purpose.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then,\" said Madeline, \"why not hunt on Philip\u0027s trail? I have no doubt you can track him from Texas to the Pacific by the traditions of his wild pranks and adventures! How I should enjoy getting hold of a few chapters of his history!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Madeline, you are a genius!\" Philip cried. \"How could I have forgotten Wilder\u0027s letter, a fortnight ago, you remember? One need not be a practical geologist to make the business report he wants; but Joseph has read enough to take hold, with the aid of the books I can give him! If it is not too late!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I was not thinking of that, Philip,\" Madeline answered. \"Did you not say that the place was—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She hesitated. \"Dangerous?\" said Philip. \"Yes. But if Joseph goes there, he will come back to us again.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"O, don\u0027t invoke misfortune in that way!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Neither do I,\" he gravely replied; \"but I can see the shadow of Joseph\u0027s life thrown ahead, as I can see my own.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think I should like to be sent into danger,\" said Joseph. \\n\\n \\n\\n Philip smiled: \"As if you had not just escaped the greatest! Well,—it was Madeline\u0027s guess which most helped to avert it, and now it is her chance word which will probably send you into another one.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Joseph looked up in astonishment. \"I don\u0027t understand you, Philip,\" he said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"O Philip!\" cried Madeline. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I had really forgotten,\" he answered, \"that you knew nothing of the course by which we reached your defence. Madeline first suggested to me that the poison was sometimes used as a cosmetic, and on this hint, with Mr. Blessing\u0027s help, the truth was discovered.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And I did not know how much I owe to you!\" Joseph, exclaimed, turning towards her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do not thank me,\" she said, \"for Philip thinks the fortunate guess may be balanced by an evil one.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, no!\" Joseph protested, noticing the slight tremble in her voice; \"I will take it as a good omen. Now I know that danger will pass me by, if it comes!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If your experience should be anything like mine,\" said Philip, \"you will only recognize the danger when you can turn and look back at it. But, come! Madeline has less superstition in her nature than she would have us believe. Wilder\u0027s offer is just the thing; I have his letter on file, and will write to him at once. Let us go down to my office at the Forge!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The letter was from a capitalist who had an interest in several mines in Arizona and Nevada. He was not satisfied with the returns, and wished to send a private, confidential agent to those regions, to examine the prospects and operations of the companies and report thereupon. With the aid of a map the probable course of travel was marked out, and Joseph rejoiced at the broad field of activity and adventure which it opened to him. \\n\\n \\n\\n He stayed with Philip a day or two longer, and every evening the fire made a cheery accompaniment to the deepest and sweetest confidences of their hearts, now pausing as if to listen, now rapidly murmuring some happy, inarticulate secret of its own. As each gradually acquired full possession of the other\u0027s past, the circles of their lives, as Philip said, were reciprocally widened; but as the horizon spread, it seemed to meet a clearer sky. Their eyes were no longer fixed on the single point of time wherein they breathed. Whatever pain remained, melted before them and behind them into atmospheres of resignation and wiser patience. One gave his courage and experience, the other his pure instinct, his faith and aspiration; and a new harmony came from the closer interfusion of sweetness and strength. \\n\\n \\n\\n When Joseph returned home, he at once set about putting his affairs in order, and making arrangements for an absence of a year or more. It was necessary that he should come in contact with most of his neighbors, and he was made aware of their good will without knowing that it was, in many cases, a reaction from suspicion and slanderous gossip. Mr. Chaffinch had even preached a sermon, in which no name was mentioned, but everybody understood the allusion. This was considered to be perfectly right, so long as the prejudices of the people were with him, and Julia was supposed to be the pious and innocent victim of a crime. When, however, the truth had been established, many who had kept silent now denounced the sermon, and another on the deceitfulness of appearances, which Mr. Chaffinch gave on the following Sabbath, was accepted as the nearest approach to an apology consistent with his clerical dignity. \\n\\n \\n\\n Joseph was really ignorant of these proceedings, and the quiet, self-possessed, neighborly way in which he met the people gave them a new impression of his character. Moreover, he spoke of his circumstances, when it was necessary, with a frankness unusual among them; and the natural result was that his credit was soon established on as sound a basis as ever. When, through Philip\u0027s persistence, the mission to the Pacific coast was secured, but little further time was needed to complete the arrangements. By the sacrifice of one-fourth of his land, the rest was saved, and intrusted to good hands during his absence. Philip, in the mean time, had fortified him with as many hints and instructions as possible, and he was ready, with a light heart and a full head, to set out upon the long and uncertain journey. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1815/52744.html","bookId":1041,"book":{"id":1041,"title":"Joseph and His Friend","description":"简介： Rachel Miller was not a little surprised when her nephew Joseph came to the supper-table, not from the direction of the barn and through the kitchen, as usual, but from the back room up stairs, where he slept.
