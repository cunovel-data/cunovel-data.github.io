{"id":16284,"no":18,"title":"CHAPTER XVIII. ON THE RAILROAD TRACK.","content":"Still walking, with bent head, and a brain which vainly strove to work its way to clearness through the perplexities of his heart, Joseph went on. When, wearied at last, though not consciously calmer, he paused and looked about him, it was like waking from a dream. Some instinct had guided him on the way to Philip\u0027s forge: the old road had been moved to accommodate the new branch railway, and a rapid ring of hammers came up from the embankment below. It was near the point of the hill where Lucy\u0027s schoolhouse stood, and even as he looked she came, accompanied by her scholars, to watch the operation of laying the track. Elwood Withers, hale, sunburnt, full of lusty life, walked along the sleepers directing the workmen. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He was right,—only too right!\" muttered Joseph to himself. \"Why could I not see with his eyes? \u0027It\u0027s the bringing up,\u0027 he would say; but that is not all. I have been an innocent, confiding boy, and thought that years and acres had made me a man. O, she understood me—she understands me now; but in spite of her, God helping me, I shall yet be a man.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Elwood ran down the steep side of the embankment, greeted Lucy, and helped her to the top, the children following with whoops and cries. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Would it have been different,\" Joseph further soliloquized, \"if Lucy and I had loved and married? It is hardly treating Elwood fairly to suppose such a thing, yet—a year ago—I might have loved her. It is better as it is: I should have stepped upon a true man\u0027s heart. Have they drawn nearer? and if so, does he, with his sturdier nature, his surer knowledge, find no flaw in her perfections?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A morbid curiosity to watch the two suddenly came upon him. He clambered over the fence, crossed the narrow strip of meadow, and mounted the embankment. Elwood\u0027s back was towards him, and he was just saying: \"It all comes of taking an interest in what you\u0027re doing. The practical part is easy enough, when you once have the principles. I can manage the theodolite already, but I need a little showing when I come to the calculations. Somehow, I never cared much about study before, but here it\u0027s all applied as soon as you\u0027ve learned it, and that fixes it, like, in your head.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Lucy was listening with an earnest, friendly interest on her face. She scarcely saw Joseph until he stood before her. After the first slight surprise, her manner towards him was quiet and composed: Elwood\u0027s eyes were bright, and there was a fresh intelligence in his appearance. The habit of command had already given him a certain dignity. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How can I get knowledge which may be applied as soon as learned?\" Joseph asked, endeavoring to assume the manner furthest from his feelings. \"I\u0027m still at the foot of the class, Lucy,\" he added, turning to her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How?\" Elwood replied. \"I should say by going around the world alone. That would be about the same for you as what these ten miles I\u0027m overseeing are to me. A little goes a great way with me, for I can only pick up one thing at a time.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What kind of knowledge are you looking for, Joseph?\" Lucy gravely asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of myself,\" said he, and his face grew dark. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s a true word!\" Elwood involuntarily exclaimed. He then caught Lucy\u0027s eye, and awkwardly added: \"It\u0027s about what we all want, I take it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Joseph recovered himself in a moment, and proposed looking over the work. They walked slowly along the embankment, listening to Elwood\u0027s account of what had been done and what was yet to do, when the Hopeton carriage came up the highway, near at hand. Mrs. Hopeton sat in it alone. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I was looking for you, Lucy,\" she called. \"If you are going towards the cutting, I will join you there.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She sent the coachman home with the carriage, and walked with them on the track. Joseph felt her presence as a relief, but Elwood confessed to himself that he was a little disturbed by the steady glance of her dark eyes. He had already overcome his regret at the interruption of his rare and welcome chance of talking with Lucy, but then Joseph knew his heart, while this stately lady looked as if she were capable of detecting what she had no right to know. Nevertheless, she was Lucy\u0027s friend, and that fact had great weight with Elwood. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s rather a pity to cut into the hills and bank up the meadows in this way, isn\u0027t it?\" he asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And to disturb my school with so much hammering,\" Lucy rejoined; \"when the trains come I must retreat.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"None too soon,\" said Mrs. Hopeton. \"You are not strong, Lucy, and the care of a school is too much for you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Elwood thanked her with a look, before he knew what he was about. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"After all,\" said Joseph, \"why shouldn\u0027t nature be cut up? I suppose everything was given up to us to use, and the more profit the better the use, seems to be the rule of the world. \u0027Beauty grows out of Use,\u0027 you know.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n His tone was sharp and cynical, and grated unpleasantly on Lucy\u0027s sensitive ear. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I believe it is a rule in art,\" said Mrs. Hopeton, \"that mere ornament, for ornament\u0027s sake, is not allowed. It must always seem to answer some purpose, to have a necessity for its existence. But, on the other hand, what is necessary should be beautiful, if possible.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A loaf of bread, for instance,\" suggested Elwood. \\n\\n \\n\\n They all laughed at this illustration, and the conversation took a lighter turn. By this time they had entered the narrower part of the valley, and on passing around a sharp curve of the track found themselves face to face with Philip and Madeline Held. \\n\\n \\n\\n If Mrs. Hopeton\u0027s heart beat more rapidly at the unexpected meeting, she preserved her cold, composed bearing. Madeline, bright and joyous, was the unconscious agent of unconstraint, in whose presence each of the others felt immediately free. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Two inspecting committees at once!\" cried Philip. \"It is well for you, Withers, that you didn\u0027t locate the line. My sister and I have already found several unnecessary curves and culverts.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And we have found a great deal of use and no beauty,\" Lucy answered. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Beauty!\" exclaimed Madeline. \"What is more beautiful than to see one\u0027s groceries delivered at one\u0027s very door? Or to have the opera and the picture-gallery brought within two hours\u0027 distance? How far are we from a lemon, Philip?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You were a lemon, Mad, in your vegetable, pre-human state; and you are still acid and agreeable.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sweets to the sweet!\" she gayly cried. \"And what, pray, was Miss Henderson?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t spare me, Mr. Held,\" said Lucy, as he looked at her with a little hesitation. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"An apple.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And Mrs. Hopeton?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A date-palm,\" said Philip, fixing his eyes upon her face. \\n\\n \\n\\n She did not look up, but an expression which he could not interpret just touched her lips and faded. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now, it\u0027s your turn, Miss Held,\" Elwood remarked: \"what were we men?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"O, Philip a prickly pear, of course; and you, well, some kind of a nut; and Mr. Asten—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A cabbage,\" said Joseph. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What vanity! Do you imagine that you are all head,—or that your heart is in your head? Or that you keep the morning dew longer than the rest of us?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It might well be,\" Joseph answered; and Madeline felt her arm gently pinched by Philip, from behind. She had tact enough not to lower her pitch of gayety too suddenly, but her manner towards Joseph became grave and gentle. Mrs. Hopeton said but little: she looked upon the circling hills, as if studying their summer beauty, while the one desire in her heart was to be away from the spot,—away from Philip\u0027s haunting eyes. \\n\\n \\n\\n After a little while, Philip seemed to be conscious of her feeling. He left his place on the opposite side of the track, took Joseph\u0027s arm and led him a little aside from the group. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Philip, I want you!\" Joseph whispered; \"but no, not quite yet. There is no need of coming to you in a state of confusion. In a day or two more I shall have settled a little.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You are right,\" said Philip: \"there is no opiate like time, be there never so little of it. I felt the fever of your head in your hand. Don\u0027t come to me, until you feel that it is the one thing which must be done! I think you know why I say so.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I do!\" Joseph exclaimed. \"I am just now more of an ostrich than anything else; I should like to stick my head in the sand, and imagine myself invisible. But—Philip—here are six of us together. One other, I know, has a secret wound, perhaps two others: is it always so in life? I think I am selfish enough to be glad to know that I am not specially picked out for punishment.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Philip could not help smiling. \"Upon my soul,\" he said, \"I believe Madeline is the only one of the six who is not busy with other thoughts than those we all seem to utter. Specially picked out? There is no such thing as special picking out, in this world! Joseph, it may seem hard and schoolmaster-like in me again to say \u0027wait!\u0027 yet that is the only word I can say.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Good evening, all!\" cried Elwood. \"I must go down to my men; but I\u0027d be glad of such an inspection as this, a good deal oftener.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll go that far with you,\" said Joseph. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Hopeton took Lucy\u0027s arm with a sudden, nervous movement. \"If you are not too tired, let us walk over the hill,\" she said; \"I want to find the right point of view for sketching our house.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The company dissolved. Philip, as he walked up the track with his sister, said to himself: \"Surely she was afraid of me. And what does her fear indicate? What, if not that the love she once bore for me still lives in her heart, in spite of time and separated fates? I should not, dare not think of her; I shall never again speak a word to her which her husband might not hear; but I cannot tear from me the dream of what she might be, the knowledge of what she is, false, hopeless, fatal, as it all may be!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Elwood,\" said Joseph, when they had walked a little distance in silence, \"do you remember the night you spent with me, a year ago?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m not likely to forget it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Let me ask you one question, then. Have you come nearer to Lucy Henderson?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If no further off means nearer, and it almost seems so in my case,—yes!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And you see no difference in her,—no new features of character, which you did not guess, at first?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Indeed, I do!\" Elwood emphatically answered. \"To me she grows less and less like any other woman,—so right, so straightforward, so honest in all her ways and thoughts! If I am ever tempted to do anything—well, not exactly mean, you know, but such as a man might as well leave undone, I have only to say to myself: \u0027If you\u0027re not thoroughly good, my boy, you\u0027ll lose her!\u0027 and that does the business, right away. Why, Joseph, I\u0027m proud of myself, that I mean to deserve her!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah!\" A sigh, almost a groan, came from Joseph\u0027s lips. \"What will you think of me?\" he said. \"I was about to repeat your own words,—to warn you to be cautious, and take time, and test your feelings, and not to be too sure of her perfection! What can a young man know about women? He can only discover the truth after marriage, and then—they are indifferent how it affects him—their fortunes are made!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I know,\" answered Elwood, turning his head away slightly; \"but there\u0027s a difference between the women you seek, and work to get, and the women who seek, and work to get you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I understand you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Forgive me for saying it!\" Elwood cried, instantly repenting his words. \"I couldn\u0027t help seeing and feeling what you know now. But what man—leastways, what friend—could ha\u0027 said it to you with any chance of being believed? You were like a man alone in a boat above a waterfall; only you could bring yourself to shore. If I stood on the bank and called, and you didn\u0027t believe me, what then? The Lord knows, I\u0027d give this right arm, strong as it is, to put you back where you were a year ago.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve been longing for frankness, and I ought to bear it better,\" said Joseph. \"Put the whole subject out of your thoughts, and come and see me as of old. It is quite time I should learn to manage my own life.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He grasped Elwood\u0027s hand convulsively, sprang down the embankment, and took to the highway. Elwood looked after him a minute, then slowly shook his head and walked onward towards the men. \\n\\n \\n\\n Meanwhile, Mrs. Hopeton and Lucy had climbed the hill, and found themselves on the brow of a rolling upland, which fell on the other side towards the old Calvert place. The day was hot. Mrs. Hopeton\u0027s knees trembled under her, and she sank on the soft grass at the foot of a tree. Lucy took a seat beside her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You know so much of my trouble,\" said the former, when the coolness and rest had soothed her, \"and I trust you so perfectly, that I can tell you all, Lucy. Can you guess the man whom I loved, but must never love again?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have sometimes thought—\" but here Lucy hesitated. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Speak the name in your mind, or, let me say \u0027Philip Held\u0027 for you! Lucy, what am I to do? he loves me still: he told me so, just now, where we were all together below there!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Lucy turned with a start, and gazed wonderingly upon her friend\u0027s face. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why does he continue telling me what I must not hear? with his eyes, Lucy! in the tones of his voice, in common words which I am forced to interpret by his meaning! I had learned to bear my inevitable fate, for it is not an unhappy one; I can bear even his presence, if he were generous enough to close his heart as I do,—either that, or to avoid me; for I now dread to meet him again.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is it not,\" Lucy asked, \"because the trial is new, and takes you by surprise and unprepared? May you not be fearing more than Mr. Held has expressed, or, at least, intended?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The speech that kills, or makes alive, needs no words. What I mean is, there is no resistance in his face. I blush for myself, I am indignant at my own pitiful weakness, but something in his look to-day made me forget everything that has passed since we were parted. While it lasted, I was under a spell,—a spell which it humiliates me to remember. Your voices sounded faint and far-off; all that I have, and hold, seemed to be slipping from me. It was only for a moment, but, Lucy, it frightened me. My will is strong, and I think I can depend upon it; yet what if some influence beyond my control were to paralyze it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then you must try to win the help of a higher will; our souls always win something of that which they wrestle and struggle to reach. Dear Mrs. Hopeton, have you never thought that we are still as children who cannot have all they cry for? Now that you know what you fear, do not dread to hold it before your mind and examine what it is: at least, I think that would be my instinct,—to face a danger at once when I found I could not escape it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have no doubt you are right, Lucy,\" said Mrs. Hopeton; but her tone was sad, as if she acquiesced without clearly believing. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It seems very hard,\" Lucy continued, \"when we cannot have the one love of all others that we need, harder still when we must put it forcibly from our hearts. But I have always felt that, when we can bring ourselves to renounce cheerfully, a blessing will follow. I do not know how, but I must believe it. Might it not come at last through the love that we have, though it now seems imperfect?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Hopeton lifted her head from her knees, and sat erect. \"Lucy,\" she said, \"I do not believe you are a woman who would ask another to bear what is beyond your own strength. Shall I put you to the test?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Lucy, though her face became visibly paler, replied: \"I did not mean to compare my burden with yours; but weigh me, if you wish. If I am found wanting, you will show me wherein.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Your one love above all others is lost to you. Have you conquered the desire for it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think I have. If some soreness remains, I try to believe that it is the want of the love which I know to be possible, not that of the—the person.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then could you be happy with what you call an imperfect love?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Lucy blushed a little, in spite of herself. \"I am still free,\" she answered, \"and not obliged to accept it. If I were bound, I hope I should not neglect my duty.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What if another\u0027s happiness depended on your accepting it? Lucy, my eyes have been made keen by what I have felt. I saw to-day that a man\u0027s heart follows you, and I guess that you know it. Here is no imperfect love on his part: were you his wife, could you learn to give him so much that your life might become peaceful and satisfied?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You do, indeed, test me!\" Lucy murmured. \"How can I know? What answer can I make? I have shrunk from thinking of that, and I cannot feel that my duty lies there. Yet, if it were so, if I were already bound, irrevocably, surely all my present faith must be false if happiness in some form did not come at last!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I believe it would, to you!\" cried Mrs. Hopeton. \"Why not to me? Do you think I have ever looked for love in my husband? It seems, now, that I have been content to know that he was proud of me. If I seek, perhaps I may find more than I have dreamed of; and if I find,—if indeed and truly I find,—I shall never more lack self-possession and will!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She rose to her full height, and a flush came over the pallor of her cheeks. \"Yes,\" she continued, \"rather than feel again the humiliation of to-day, I will trample all my nature down to the level of an imperfect love!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Better,\" said Lucy, rising also,—\"better to bend only for a while to the imperfect, that you may warm and purify and elevate it, until it shall take the place of the perfect in your heart.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The two women kissed each other, and there were tears on the cheeks of both. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1815/52731.html","bookId":1041,"book":{"id":1041,"title":"Joseph and His Friend","description":"简介： Rachel Miller was not a little surprised when her nephew Joseph came to the supper-table, not from the direction of the barn and through the kitchen, as usual, but from the back room up stairs, where he slept.
