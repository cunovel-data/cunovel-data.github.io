{"id":16287,"no":21,"title":"CHAPTER XXI. UNDER THE WATER.","content":"Joseph said nothing that evening concerning the result of his trip to the city, and Julia, who instantly detected the signs which a powerful excitement had left upon his face, thought it prudent to ask no immediate questions. She was purposely demonstrative in little arrangements for his comfort, but spared him her caresses; she did not intend to be again mistaken in choosing the time and occasion of bestowing them. \n \n The next morning, when he felt that he could speak calmly, Joseph told her what he had done, carefully avoiding any word that might seem to express disappointment, or even doubt. \n \n \"I hope you are satisfied that pa will make it easy for you?\" she ventured to say. \n \n \"He thinks so.\" Then Joseph could not help adding: \"He depends, I imagine, upon your sister Clementina marrying a Mr. Spelter,—\u0027a man of immense wealth, but, I regret to say, no refinement.\u0027\" \n \n Julia bit her lip, and her eyes assumed that hard, flinty look which her husband knew so well. \"If Clementina marries immense wealth,\" she exclaimed, with a half-concealed sneer, \"she will become simply insufferable! But what difference can that make in pa\u0027s business affairs?\" \n \n The answer tingled on Joseph\u0027s tongue: \"Probably he expects Mr. Spelter to indorse a promissory note\"; but he held it back. \"What I have resolved to do is this,\" he said. \"In a day or two—as soon as I can arrange to leave—I shall make a journey to the oil region, and satisfy myself where and what the Amaranth is. Your own practical instincts will tell you, Julia, that this intention of mine must be kept secret, even from your father.\" \n \n She leaned her head upon her hand, and appeared to reflect. When she looked up her face had a cheerful, confiding expression. \n \n \"I think you are right,\" she then said. \"If—if things should not happen to be quite as they are represented, you can secure yourself against any risk—and pa, too—before the others know of it. You will have the inside track; that is, if there is one. On the other hand, if all is right, pa can easily manage, if some of the others are shaky in their faith, to get their stock at a bargain. I am sure he would have gone out there himself, if his official services were not so important to the government.\" \n \n It was a hard task for Joseph to keep his feelings to himself. \n \n \"And now,\" she continued,—\"now I know you will agree to a plan of mine, which I was going to propose. Lucy Henderson\u0027s school closes this week, and Mrs. Hopeton tells me she is a little overworked and ailing. It would hardly help her much to go home, where she could not properly rest, as her father is a hard, avaricious man, who can\u0027t endure idleness, except, I suppose, in a corpse (so these people seem to me). I want to ask Lucy to come here. I think you always liked her\" (here Julia shot a swift, stealthy glance at Joseph), \"and so she will be an agreeable guest for both of us. She shall just rest and grow strong. While you are absent, I shall not seem quite so lonely. You may be gone a week or more, and I shall find the separation very hard to bear, even with her company.\" \n \n \"Why has Mrs. Hopeton not invited her?\" Joseph asked. \n \n \"The Hopetons are going to the sea-shore in a few days. She would take Lucy as a guest, but there is one difficulty in the way. She thinks Lucy would accept the trip and the stay there as an act of hospitality, but that she cannot (or thinks she cannot) afford the dresses that would enable her to appear in Mrs. Hopeton\u0027s circle. But it is just as well: I am sure Lucy would feel more at home here.\" \n \n \"Then by all means ask her!\" said Joseph. \"Lucy Henderson is a noble girl, for she has forced a true-hearted man to love her, without return.\" \n \n \"Ind-e-e-d!\" \n \n Julia\u0027s drawl denoted surprise and curiosity, but Joseph felt that once more he had spoken too quickly. He endeavored to cover his mistake by a hearty acquiescence in the plan, which was speedily arranged between them, in all its details, Lucy\u0027s consent being taken for granted. \n \n It required, however, the extreme of Julia\u0027s powers of disguise, aided by Joseph\u0027s frank and hearty words and Mrs. Hopeton\u0027s influence, to induce Lucy to accept the invitation. Unable to explain wholly to herself, much less mention to any other, the instinct which held her back, she found herself, finally, placed in a false position, and then resolved to blindly trust that she was doing right, inasmuch as she could not make it clear that she was doing wrong. Her decision once taken, she forcibly banished all misgivings, and determined to find nothing but a cheerful and restful holiday before her. \n \n And, indeed, the first day or two of her residence at the farm, before Joseph\u0027s departure, brought her a more agreeable experience than she had imagined. Both host and hostess were busy, the latter in the household and the former in the fields, and when they met at meals or in the evening, her presence was an element which compelled an appearance of harmony. She was surprised to find so quiet and ordered a life in two persons whom she had imagined to be miserably unfitted for each other, and began to suspect that she had been seriously mistaken. \n \n After Joseph left, the two women were much together. Julia insisted that she should do nothing, and amiably protested at first against Lucy giving her so much of her society; but, little by little, the companionship was extended and became more frank and intimate. Lucy was in a charitable mood, and found it very easy to fancy that Julia\u0027s character had been favorably affected by the graver duties which had come with her marriage. Indeed, Julia found many indirect ways of hinting as much: she feared she had seemed flighty (perhaps a little shallow); looking back upon her past life she could see that such a charge would not be unjust. Her education had been so superficial; all city education of young women was false; they were taught to consider external appearances, and if they felt a void in their nature which these would not fill, whither could they turn for counsel or knowledge? \n \n Her face was sad and thoughtful while she so spoke; but when, shaking her dark curls with a pretty impatience, she would lift her head and ask, with a smile: \"But it is not too late, in my case, is it? I\u0027m really an older child, you know,\"—Lucy could only answer: \"Since you know what you need, it can never be too late. The very fact that you do know, proves that it will be easy for you.\" \n \n Then Julia would shake her head again, and say, \"O, you are too kind, Lucy; you judge my nature by your own.\" \n \n When the friendly relation between them had developed a little further, Julia became—though still with a modest reticence—more confiding in relation to Joseph. \n \n \"He is so good, so very, very true and good,\" she said, one day, \"that it grieves me, more than I can tell, to be the cause of a little present anxiety of his. As it is only a business matter, some exaggerated report of which you have probably heard (for I know there have been foolish stories afloat in the neighborhood), I have no hesitation about confiding it to you. Perhaps you can advise me how to atone for my error; for, if it was an error, I fear it cannot be remedied now; if not, it will be a relief to me to confess it.\" \n \n Thereupon she gave a minute history of the Amaranth speculation, omitting the energy of her persuasion with Joseph, and presenting very strongly her father\u0027s views of a sure and splendid success soon to follow. \"It was for Joseph\u0027s sake,\" she concluded, \"rather than my own, that I advised the investment; though, knowing his perfect unselfishness, I fear he complied only for mine. He had guessed already, it seems to me now, that we women like beauty as well as comfort about our lives; otherwise, he would hardly have undertaken these expensive improvements of our home. But, Lucy, it terrifies me to think that pa and Joseph and I may have been deceived! The more I shut my mind against the idea the more it returns to torment me. I, who brought so little to him, to be the instrument of such a loss! O, if you were not here, how could I endure the anxiety and the absence?\" \n \n She buried her face in her handkerchief, and sobbed. \n \n \"I know Joseph to be good and true,\" said Lucy, \"and I believe that he will bear the loss cheerfully, if it should come. But it is never good to \u0027borrow trouble,\u0027 as we say in the country. Neither the worst nor the best things which we imagine ever come upon us.\" \n \n \"You are wrong!\" cried Julia, starting up and laughing gleefully; \"I have the best thing, in my husband! And yet, you are right, too: no worst thing can come to me, while I keep him!\" \n \n Lucy wished to visit the Hopetons before their departure for the sea-shore, and Julia was quite ready to accompany her. Only, with the wilfulness common to all selfish natures, she determined to arrange the matter in her own way. She drove away alone the next morning to the post-office, with a letter for Joseph, but never drew rein until she had reached Coventry Forge. Philip being absent, she confided to Madeline Held her wish (and Lucy\u0027s) that they should all spend an afternoon together, on the banks of the stream,—a free society in the open air instead of a formal one within doors. Madeline entered into the plan with joyous readiness, accepting both for herself and for Philip. They all met together too rarely, she said: a lunch or a tea under the trees would be delightful: there was a little skiff which might be borrowed, and they might even catch and cook their own fish, as the most respectable people did in the Adirondacks. \n \n Julia then drove to the Hopetons in high spirits. Mr. Hopeton found the proposed party very pleasant, and said at once to his wife: \"We have still three days, my dear: we can easily spare to-morrow?\" \n \n \"Mrs. Asten is very kind,\" she replied; \"and her proposition is tempting: but I should not like to go without you, and I thought your business might—\" \n \n \"O, there is nothing pressing,\" he interrupted. \"I shall enjoy it exceedingly, especially the boat, and the chance of landing a few trout.\" \n \n So it was settled. Lucy, it is true, felt a dissatisfaction which she could scarcely conceal, and possibly did not, to Julia\u0027s eyes; but it was not for her own sake. She must seem grateful for a courtesy meant to favor both herself and her friend, and a little reflection reconciled her to the plan. Mrs. Hopeton dared not avoid Philip Held, and it might be well if she carried away with her to the sea-shore a later and less alarming memory of him. Lucy\u0027s own desire for a quiet talk with the woman in whom she felt such a loving interest was of no consequence, if this was the result. \n \n They met in the afternoon, on the eastern side of the stream, just below the Forge, where a little bay of level shore, shaded by superb trees, was left between the rocky bluffs. Stumps and a long-fallen trunk furnished them with rough tables and seats; there was a natural fireplace among some huge tumbled stones; a spring of icy crystal gushed out from the foot of the bluff; and the shimmering, murmuring water in front, with the meadows beyond burning like emerald flame in the sunshine, offered a constant delight to the senses. \n \n All were enchanted with the spot, which Philip and Madeline claimed as their discovery. The gypsy spirit awoke in them, and while they scattered here and there, possessed with the influences of the place, and constantly stumbling upon some new charm or convenience, Lucy felt her heart grow light for her friend, and the trouble of her own life subside. For a time no one seemed to think of anything but the material arrangements. Mr. Hopeton\u0027s wine-flasks were laid in the spring to cool; Philip improvised a rustic table upon two neighboring stumps; rough seats were made comfortable, dry sticks collected for fire-wood, stores unpacked and placed in readiness, and every little preliminary of labor, insufferable in a kitchen, took on its usual fascination in that sylvan nook. \n \n Then they rested from their work. Mr. Hopeton and Philip lighted cigars and sat to leeward, while the four ladies kept their fingers busy with bunches of maiden-hair and faint wildwood blossoms, as they talked. It really seemed as if a peace and joy from beyond their lives had fallen upon them. Madeline believed so, and Lucy hoped so: let us hope so, too, and not lift at once the veil which was folded so closely over two restless hearts! \n \n Mr. Hopeton threw away the stump of his cigar, adjusted his fishing-tackle, and said: \"If we are to have a trout supper, I must begin to troll at once.\" \n \n \"May I go with you?\" his wife asked. \n \n \"Yes,\" he answered, smiling, \"if you will not be nervous. But I hardly need to make that stipulation with you, Emily.\" \n \n Philip assisted her into the unsteady little craft, which was fastened to a tree. Mr. Hopeton seated himself carefully, took the two light, short oars, and held himself from the shore, while Philip loosened the rope. \n \n \"I shall row up stream,\" he said, \"and then float back to you, trolling as I come. When I see you again, I hope I can ask you to have the coals ready.\" \n \n Slowly, and not very skilfully, he worked his way against the current, and passed out of sight around a bend in the stream. Philip watched Mrs. Hopeton\u0027s slender figure as she sat in the stern, listlessly trailing one hand in the water. \"Does she feel that my eyes, my thoughts, are following her?\" he asked; but she did not once turn her head. \n \n \"Philip!\" cried Madeline, \"here are three forlorn maidens, and you the only Sir Isumbras, or whoever is the proper knight! Are you looking into the stream, expecting the \u0027damp woman\u0027 to arise? She only rises for fishermen: she will come up and drag Mr. Hopeton down. Let me invoke the real nymph of this stream!\" She sang:— \n \"Sabrina fair, \n Listen where thou art sitting \n Under the glassy, cool, translucent wave, \n In twisted braids of lilies knitting \n The loose train of thy amber-dropping hair; \n Listen for dear honor\u0027s sake, \n Goddess of the silver lake, \n Listen and save!\" \n \n Madeline did not know what she was doing. She could not remark Philip\u0027s paleness in the dim green light where they sat, but she was struck by the startled expression of his eyes. \n \n \"One would think you really expected Sabrina to come,\" she laughed. \"Miss Henderson, too, looks as if I had frightened her. You and I, Mrs. Asten, are the only cool, unimaginative brains in the party. But perhaps it was all owing to my poor voice? Come now, confess it! I don\u0027t expect you to say,— \n \u0027Can any mortal mixture of earth\u0027s mould \n Breathe such divine, enchanting ravishment?\u0027\" \n \n \"I was trying to place the song,\" said Lucy; \"I read it once.\" \n \n \"If any one could evoke a spirit, Madeline,\" Philip replied, \"it would be you. But the spirit would be no nymph; it would have little horns and hoofs, and you would be glad to get rid of it again.\" \n \n They all laughed at this, and presently, at Julia\u0027s suggestion, arranged the wood they had collected, and kindled a fire. It required a little time and patience to secure a strong blaze, and in the great interest which the task called forth the Hopetons were forgotten. \n \n At last Philip stepped back, heated and half stifled, for a breath of fresher air, and, turning, saw the boat between the trees gliding down the stream. \"There they are!\" he cried; \"now, to know our luck!\" \n \n Tho boat was in midstream, not far from a stony strip which rose above the water. Mrs. Hopeton sat musing with her hands in her lap, while her husband, resting on his knees and one hand, leaned over the bow, watching the fly which trailed at the end of his line. He seemed to be quite unconscious that an oar, which had slowly loosened itself from the lock, was floating away behind the boat. \n \n \"You are losing your oars!\" Philip cried. \n \n Mr. Hopeton started, as from a dream of trout, dropped his line and stretched forward suddenly to grasp the oar. The skiff was too light and unbalanced to support the motion. It rocked threateningly; Mrs. Hopeton, quite forgetting herself, started to her feet, and, instantly losing her equilibrium, was thrown headlong into the deeper water. The skiff whirled back, turned over, and before Mr. Hopeton was aware of what had happened, he plunged full length, face downwards, into the shallower current. \n \n It was all over before Madeline and Lucy reached the bank, and Philip was already in the stream. A few strokes brought him to Mrs. Hopeton, who struggled with the current as she rose to the surface, but made no outcry. No sooner had she touched Philip than she seized and locked him in her arms, and he was dragged down again with her. It was only the physical clinging to life: if some feeble recognition at that moment told her whose was the form she held and made powerless, it could not have abated an atom of her frantic, instinctive force. \n \n Philip felt that they had drifted into water beyond his depth. With great exertion he freed his right arm and sustained himself and her a moment at the surface. Mrs. Hopeton\u0027s head was on his shoulder; her hair drifted against his face, and even the desperation of the struggle could not make him insensible to the warmth of her breast upon his own. A wild thought flashed upon and stung his brain: she was his at last—his in death, if not in life! \n \n His arm slackened, and they sank slowly together. Heart and brain were illuminated with blinding light, and the swift succession of his thoughts compressed an age into the fragment of a second. Yes, she was his now: clasping him as he clasped, their hearts beating against each other, with ever slower pulsations, until they should freeze into one. The world, with its wrongs and prejudices, lay behind them; the past was past, and only a short and painless atonement intervened between the immortal possession of souls! Better that it should end thus: he had not sought this solution, but he would not thrust it from him. \n \n But, even as his mind accepted it, and with a sense of perfect peace, He heard Joseph\u0027s voice, saying, \"We must shape our lives according to the law which is above, not that which is below us.\" Through the air and the water, on the very rock which now overhung his head, he again saw Joseph bending, and himself creeping towards him with outstretched hand. Ha! who was the coward now? And again Joseph spake, and his words were: \"The very wrong that has come upon us makes God necessary.\" God? Then how would God in his wisdom fashion their future life? Must they sweep eternally, locked in an unsevering embrace, like Paolo and Francesca, around some dreary circle of hell? Or must the manner of entering that life together be the act to separate them eternally? Only the inevitable act dare ask for pardon; but here, if not will or purpose, was at least submission without resistance! Then it seemed to him that Madeline\u0027s voice came again to him, ringing like a trumpet through the waters, as she sang:— \n \"Listen for dear honor\u0027s sake, \n Goddess of the silver lake, \n Listen and save!\" \n \n He pressed his lips to Mrs. Hopeton\u0027s unconscious brow, his heart saying, \"Never, never again!\" released himself by a sudden, powerful effort, seized her safely, as a practised swimmer, shot into light and air, and made for the shallower side of the stream. The upturned skiff was now within reach, and all danger was over. \n \n Who could guess that the crisis of a soul had been reached and passed in that breath of time under the surface? Julia\u0027s long, shrill scream had scarcely come to an end; Mr. Hopeton, bewildered by his fall, was trying to run towards them through water up to his waist, and Lucy and Madeline looked on, holding their breath in an agony of suspense. In another moment Philip touched bottom, and raising Mrs. Hopeton in his arms, carried her to the opposite bank. \n \n She was faint and stunned, but not unconscious. She passively allowed Philip to support her until Mr. Hopeton, struggling through the shallows, drew near with an expression of intense terror and concern on his broad face. Then, breaking from Philip, she half fell, half flung herself into his arms, laid her head upon his shoulder, and burst into a fit of hysterical weeping. \n \n Tears began to run down the honest man\u0027s cheeks, and Philip, turning away, busied himself with righting the boat and recovering the oars. \n \n \"O, my darling!\" said Mr. Hopeton, \"what should I do if I had lost you?\" \n \n \"Hold me, keep me, love me!\" she cried. \"I must not leave you!\" \n \n He held her in his arms, he kissed her, he soothed her with endearing words. She grew calm, lifted her head, and looked in his eyes with a light which he had never yet seen in them. The man\u0027s nature was moved and stirred: his lips trembled, and the tears still slowly trickled from his eyes. \n \n \"Let me set you over!\" Philip called from the stream. \"The boat is wet, but then neither of us is dry. We have, fortunately, a good fire until the carriage can be brought for Mrs. Hopeton, and your wine will be needed at once.\" \n \n They had no trout, nor indeed any refreshment, except the wine. Philip tried to rally the spirits of the party, but Julia was the only one who at all seconded his efforts; the others had been too profoundly agitated. Mr. and Mrs. Hopeton were grave; it seemed scarcely possible for them to speak, and yet, as Lucy remarked with amazement, the faces of both were bright and serene. \n \n \"I shall never invoke another water-nymph,\" said Madeline, as they were leaving the spot. \n \n \"Yes!\" Philip cried, \"always invoke Sabrina, and the daughter of Locrine will arise for you, as she arose to-day.\" \n \n \"That is, not at all?\" \n \n \"No,\" said Philip, \"she arose.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1815/52734.html","bookId":1041,"book":{"id":1041,"title":"Joseph and His Friend","description":"简介： Rachel Miller was not a little surprised when her nephew Joseph came to the supper-table, not from the direction of the barn and through the kitchen, as usual, but from the back room up stairs, where he slept.
