{"id":16277,"no":11,"title":"CHAPTER XI. A CITY WEDDING.","content":"There was not much of the happy bridegroom to be seen in Joseph\u0027s face when he arose the next morning. To Philip\u0027s eyes he appeared to have suddenly grown several years older; his features had lost their boyish softness and sweetness, which would thenceforth never wholly come back again. He spoke but little, and went about his preparation with an abstracted, mechanical air, which told how much his mind was preoccupied. Philip quietly assisted, and when all was complete, led him before the mirror. \n \n \"There!\" he said; \"now study the general effect; I think nothing more is wanting.\" \n \n \"It hardly looks like myself,\" Joseph remarked, after a careless inspection. \n \n \"In all the weddings I have seen,\" said Philip, \"the bridegrooms were pale and grave, the brides flushed and trembling. You will not make an exception to the rule; but it is a solemn thing, and I—don\u0027t misunderstand me, Joseph—I almost wish you were not to be married to-day.\" \n \n \"Philip!\" Joseph exclaimed, \"let me think, now, at least,—now, at the last moment,—that it is best for me! If you knew how cramped, restricted, fettered, my life has been, and how much emancipation has already come with this—this love! Perhaps my marriage is a venture, but it is one which must be made; and no consequence of it shall ever come between us!\" \n \n \"No; and I ought not to have spoken a word that might imply a doubt. It may be that your emancipation, as you rightly term it, can only come in this way. My life has been so different, that I am unconsciously putting myself in your place, instead of trying to look with your eyes. When I next go to Coventry Forge, I shall drive over and dine with you, and I hope your Julia will be as ready to receive me as a friend as I am to find one in her. There is the carriage at the door, and you had better arrive a little before the appointed hour. Take only my good wishes, my prayers for your happiness, along with you,—and now, God bless you, Joseph!\" \n \n The carriage rolled away. Joseph, in full wedding costume, was painfully conscious of the curious glances which fell upon him, and presently pulled down the curtains. Then, with an impatient self-reprimand, he pulled them up again, lowered the window, and let the air blow upon his hot cheeks. The house was speedily reached, and he was admitted by a festive waiter (hired for the occasion) before he had been exposed for more than five seconds to the gaze of curious eyes in all the windows around. \n \n Mrs. Blessing, resplendent in purple, and so bedight that she seemed almost as young as her portrait, swept into the drawing-room. She inspected him rapidly, and approved, while advancing; otherwise he would scarcely have received the thin, dry kiss with which she favored him. \n \n \"It lacks half an hour,\" she said; \"but you have the usual impatience of a bridegroom. I am accustomed to it. Mr. Blessing is still in his room; he has only just commenced arranging his cambric cravat, which is a work of time. He cannot forget that he was distinguished for an elegant tie in his youth. Clementina,\"—as that young lady entered the room,—\"is the bride completely attired?\" \n \n \"All but her gloves,\" replied Clementina, offering three-fourths of her hand to Joseph. \"And she don\u0027t know what ear-rings to wear.\" \n \n \"I think we might venture,\" Mrs. Blessing remarked, \"as there seems to be no rule applicable to the case, to allow Mr. Asten a sight of his bride. Perhaps his taste might assist her in the choice.\" \n \n Thereupon she conducted Joseph up stairs, and, after some preliminary whispering, he was admitted to the room. He and Julia were equally surprised at the change in each other\u0027s appearance: he older, paler, with a grave and serious bearing; she younger, brighter, rounder, fresher, and with the loveliest pink flush on her cheeks. The gloss of her hair rivalled that of the white satin which draped her form and gave grace to its outlines; her neck and shoulders were slight, but no one could have justly called them lean; and even the thinness of her lips was forgotten in the vivid coral of their color, and the nervous life which hovered about their edges. At that moment she was certainly beautiful, and a stranger would have supposed her to be young. \n \n She looked into Joseph\u0027s face with a smile in which some appearance of maiden shyness yet lingered. A shrewder bridegroom would have understood its meaning, and would have said, \"How lovely you are!\" Joseph, it is true, experienced a sense of relief, but he knew not why, and could not for his life have put it into words. His eyes dwelt upon and followed her, and she seemed to be satisfied with that form of recognition. Mrs. Blessing inspected the dress with a severe critical eye, pulling out a fold here and smoothing a bit of lace there, until nothing further could be detected. Then, the adornment of the victim being completed, she sat down and wept moderately. \n \n \"O ma, try to bear up!\" Julia exclaimed, with the very slightest touch of impatience in her voice; \"it is all to come yet.\" \n \n There was a ring at the door. \n \n \"It must be your aunt,\" said Mrs. Blessing, drying her eyes. \"My sister,\" she added, turning to Joseph,—Mrs. Woollish, with Mr. Woollish and their two sons and one daughter. He\u0027s in the—the leather trade, so to speak, which has thrown her into a very different circle; but, as we have no nearer relations in the city, they will be present at the ceremony. He is said to be wealthy. I have no means of knowing; but one would scarcely think so, to judge from his wedding-gift to Julia.\" \n \n \"Ma, why should you mention it?\" \n \n \"I wish to enlighten Mr. Asten. Six pairs of shoes!—of course all of the same pattern; and the fashion may change in another year!\" \n \n \"In the country we have no fashions in shoes,\" Joseph suggested. \n \n \"Certainly!\" said Julia. \"I find Uncle Woollish\u0027s present very practical indeed.\" \n \n Mrs. Blessing looked at her daughter, and said nothing. \n \n Mr. Blessing, very red in the face, but with triumphant cambric about his throat, entered the room, endeavoring to get his fat hands into a pair of No. 9 gloves. A strong smell of turpentine or benzine entered with him. \n \n \"Eliza,\" said he, \"you must find me some eau de cologne. The odor left from my—my rheumatic remedy is still perceptible. Indeed, patchouly would be better, if it were not the scent peculiar to parvenus.\" \n \n Clementina came to say that the clergyman\u0027s carriage had just reached the door, and Mr. Blessing was hurried down stairs, mopping his gloves and the collar of his coat with liquid fragrance by the way. Mrs. Blessing and Clementina presently followed. \n \n \"Julia,\" said Joseph when they were quite alone, \"have you thought that this is for life?\" \n \n She looked up with a tender smile, but something in his face arrested it on her lips. \n \n \"I have lived ignorantly until now,\" he continued,—\"innocently and ignorantly. From this time on I shall change more than you, and there may be, years hence, a very different Joseph Asten from the one whose name you will take to-day. If you love me with the love I claim from you,—the love that grows with and through all new knowledge and experience,—there will be no discord in our lives. We must both be liberal and considerate towards each other; it has been but a short time since we met, and we have still much to learn.\" \n \n \"O, Joseph!\" she murmured, in a tone of gentle reproach, \"I knew your nature at first sight.\" \n \n \"I hope you did,\" he answered gravely, \"for then you will be able to see its needs, and help me to supply them. But, Julia, there must not the shadow of concealment come between us: nothing must be reserved. I understand no love that does not include perfect trust. I must draw nearer, and be drawn nearer to you, constantly, or—\" \n \n He paused; it was no time to utter the further sentence in his mind. Julia glided to him, clasped her arms about his waist, and laid her head against his shoulder. Although she said nothing, the act was eloquent. It expressed acquiescence, trust, fidelity, the surrender of her life to his, and no man in his situation could have understood it otherwise. A tenderness, which seemed to be the something hitherto lacking to his love, crept softly over his heart, and the lurking unrest began to fade from his face. \n \n There was a rustle on the stairs; Clementina and Miss Woollish made their appearance. \"Mr. Bogue has arrived,\" whispered the former, \"and ma thinks you should come down soon. Are you entirely ready? I don\u0027t think you need the salts, Julia; but you might carry the bottle in your left hand: brides are expected to be nervous.\" \n \n She gave a light laugh, like the purl and bubble of a brook; but Joseph shrank, with an inward chill, from the sound. \n \n \"So! shall we go? Fanny and I—(I beg pardon; Mr. Asten—Miss Woollish)—will lead the way. We will stand a little in the rear, not beside you, as there are no groomsmen. Remember, the farther end of the room!\" \n \n They rustled slowly downward, in advance, and the bridal pair followed. The clergyman, Mr. Bogue, suddenly broke off in the midst of an oracular remark about the weather, and, standing in the centre of the room, awaited them. The other members of the two families were seated, and very silent. \n \n Joseph heard the introductory remarks, the ceremony, and the final benediction, as in a dream. His lips opened mechanically, and a voice which did not exactly seem to be his own uttered the \"I will!\" at the proper time; yet, in recalling the experience afterwards, he was unable to decide whether any definite thought or memory or hope had passed through his mind. From his entrance into the room until his hand was violently shaken by Mr. Blessing, there was a blank. \n \n Of course there were tears, but the beams of congratulation shone through them, and they saddened nobody. Miss Fanny Woollish assured the bridal pair, in an audible whisper, that she had never seen a sweeter wedding; and her mother, a stout, homely little body, confirmed the opinion with, \"Yes, you both did beautifully!\" Then the marriage certificate was produced and signed, and the company partook of wine and refreshments to strengthen them for the reception. \n \n Until there had been half a dozen arrivals, Mrs. Blessing moved about restlessly, and her eyes wandered to the front window. Suddenly three or four carriages came rattling together up the street, and Joseph heard her whisper to her husband: \"There they are! it will be a success!\" It was not long before the little room was uncomfortably crowded, and the presentations followed so rapidly that Joseph soon became bewildered. Julia, however, knew and welcomed every one with the most bewitching grace, being rewarded with kisses by the gorgeous young ladies and compliments by the young men with weak mouths and retreating chins. \n \n In the midst of the confusion Mr. Blessing, with a wave of his hand, presented \"Mr. Collector Twining\" and \"Mr. Surveyor Knob\" and \"Mr. Appraiser Gerrish,\" all of whom greeted Joseph with a bland, almost affectionate, cordiality. The door of the dining-room was then thrown open, and the three dignitaries accompanied the bridal pair to the table. Two servants rapidly whisked the champagne-bottles from a cooling-tub in the adjoining closet, and Mr. Blessing commenced stirring and testing a huge bowl of punch. Collector Twining made a neat little speech, proposing the health of bride and bridegroom, with a pun upon the former\u0027s name, which was received with as much delight as if it had never been heard before. Therefore Mr. Surveyor Knob repeated it in giving the health of the bride\u0027s parents. The enthusiasm of the company not having diminished, Mr. Appraiser Gerrish improved the pun in a third form, in proposing \"the Ladies.\" Then Mr. Blessing, although his feelings overcame him, and he was obliged to use a handkerchief smelling equally of benzine and eau de cologne, responded, introducing the collector\u0027s and surveyor\u0027s names with an ingenuity which was accepted as the inspiration of genius. His peroration was especially admired. \n \n \"On this happy occasion,\" he said, \"the elements of national power and prosperity are represented. My son-in-law, Mr. Asten, is a noble specimen of the agricultural population,—the free American yeomanry; my daughter, if I may be allowed to say it in the presence of so many bright eyes and blooming cheeks, is a representative child of the city, which is the embodiment of the nation\u0027s action and enterprise. The union of the two is the movement of our life. The city gives to the country as the ocean gives the cloud to the mountain-springs: the country gives to the city as the streams flow back to the ocean. [\"Admirable!\" Mr. Collector Twining exclaimed.] Then we have, as our highest honor, the representatives of the political system under which city and country flourish alike. The wings of our eagle must be extended over this fortunate house to-day, for here are the strong Claws which seize and guard its treasures!\" \n \n The health of the Claws was drunk enthusiastically. Mr. Blessing was congratulated on his eloquence; the young gentlemen begged the privilege of touching their glasses to his, and every touch required that the contents be replenished; so that the bottom of the punch-bowl was nearly reached before the guests departed. \n \n When Joseph came down in his travelling-dress, he found the drawing-room empty of the crowd; but leaves, withered flowers, crumbs of cake, and crumpled cards scattered over the carpet, indicated what had taken place. In the dining-room Mr. Blessing, with his cravat loosened, was smoking a cigar at the open window. \n \n \"Come, son-in-law!\" he cried, \"take another glass of punch before you start.\" \n \n Joseph declined, on the plea that he was not accustomed to the beverage. \n \n \"Nothing could have gone off better!\" said Mr. Blessing. \"The collector was delighted: by the by, you\u0027re to go to the St. Jerome, when you get to New York this evening. He telegraphed to have the bridal-chamber reserved for you. Tell Julia: she won\u0027t forget it. That girl has a deuced sharp intellect: if you\u0027ll be guided by her in your operations—\" \n \n \"Pa, what are you saying about me?\" Julia, asked, hastily entering the room. \n \n \"Only that you have a deuced sharp intellect, and to-day proves it. Asten is one of us now, and I may tell him of his luck.\" \n \n He winked and laughed stupidly, and Joseph understood and obeyed his wife\u0027s appealing glance. He went to his mother-in-law in the drawing-room. \n \n Julia lightly and swiftly shut the door. \"Pa,\" she said, in a strong, angry whisper; \"if you are not able to talk coherently, you must keep your tongue still. What will Joseph think of me, to hear you?\" \n \n \"What he\u0027ll think anyhow, in a little while,\" he doggedly replied. \"Julia, you have played a keen game, and played it well; but you don\u0027t know much of men yet. He\u0027ll not always be the innocent, white-nosed lamb he is now, nibbling the posies you hold out to him. Wait till he asks for stronger feed, and see whether he\u0027ll follow you!\" \n \n She was looking on the floor, pale and stern. Suddenly one of her gloves burst, across the back of the hand. \"Pa,\" she then said, \"it\u0027s very cruel to say such things to me, now when I\u0027m leaving you.\" \n \n \"So it is!\" he exclaimed, tearfully contrite; \"I am a wretch! They flattered my speech so much,—the collector was so impressed by me,—and said so many pleasant things, that—I don\u0027t feel quite steady. Don\u0027t forget the St. Jerome; the bridal-chamber is ordered, and I\u0027ll see that Mumm writes a good account for the \u0027Evening Mercury.\u0027 I wish you could be here to remember my speech for me. O, I shall miss you! I shall miss you!\" \n \n With these words, and his arm lovingly about his daughter, they joined the family. The carriage was already at the door, and the coachman was busy with the travelling-trunks. There were satchels, and little packages,—an astonishing number it seemed to Joseph,—to be gathered together, and then the farewells were said. \n \n As they rolled through the streets towards the station, Julia laid her head upon her husband\u0027s shoulder, drew a long, deep breath, and said, \"Now all our obligations to society are fulfilled, and we can rest awhile. For the first time in my life I am a free woman,—and you have liberated me!\" \n \n He answered her in glad and tender words; he was equally grateful that the exciting day was over. But, as they sped away from the city through the mellow October landscapes, Philip\u0027s earnest, dark gray eyes, warm with more than brotherly love, haunted his memory, and he knew that Philip\u0027s faithful thoughts followed him. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1815/52724.html","bookId":1041,"book":{"id":1041,"title":"Joseph and His Friend","description":"简介： Rachel Miller was not a little surprised when her nephew Joseph came to the supper-table, not from the direction of the barn and through the kitchen, as usual, but from the back room up stairs, where he slept.
