{"id":16276,"no":10,"title":"CHAPTER X. APPROACHING FATE.","content":"Only two months intervened until the time appointed for the marriage, and the days rolled swiftly away. A few lines came to Joseph from Philip Held, announcing that he was satisfied with the forge and furnace, and the sale would doubtless be consummated in a short time. He did not, however, expect to take charge of the works before March, and therefore gave Joseph his address in the city, with the hope that the latter would either visit or write to him. \\n\\n \\n\\n On the Sunday after the accident Elwood Withers came to the farm. He seemed to have grown older in the short time which had elapsed since they had last met; after his first hearty rejoicing over Joseph\u0027s escape and recovery, he relapsed into a silent but not unfriendly mood. The two young men climbed the long hill behind the house and seated themselves under a noble pin-oak on the height, whence there was a lovely view of the valley for many miles to the southward. \\n\\n \\n\\n They talked mechanically, for a while, of the season, and the crops, and the other usual subjects which farmers never get to the end of discussing; but both felt the impendence of more important themes, and, nevertheless, were slow to approach them. At last Elwood said: \"Your fate is settled by this time, I suppose?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is arranged, at least,\" Joseph replied. \"But I can\u0027t yet make clear to myself that I shall be a married man in two months from now.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Does the time seem long to you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No,\" Joseph innocently answered; \"it is very short.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Elwood turned away his head to conceal a melancholy smile; it was a few minutes before he spoke again. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Joseph,\" he then said, \"are you sure, quite sure, you love her?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am to marry her.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I meant nothing unfriendly,\" Elwood remarked, in a gentle tone. \"My thought was this,—if you should ever find a still stronger love growing upon you,—something that would make the warmth you feel now seem like ice compared to it,—how would you be able to fight it? I asked the question of myself for you. I don\u0027t think I\u0027m much different from most soft-hearted men,—except that I keep the softness so well stowed away that few persons know of it,—but if I were in your place, within two months of marriage to the girl I love, I should be miserable!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Joseph turned towards him with wide, astonished eyes. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Miserable from hope and fear,\" Elwood went on; \"I should be afraid of fever, fire, murder, thunderbolts! Every hour of the day I should dread lest something might come between us; I should prowl around her house day after day, to be sure that she was alive! I should lengthen out the time into years; and all because I\u0027m a great, disappointed, soft-hearted fool!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The sad, yearning expression of his eyes touched Joseph to the heart. \"Elwood,\" he said, \"I see that it is not in my power to comfort you; if I give you pain unknowingly, tell me how to avoid it! I meant to ask you to stand beside me when I am married; but now you must consider your own feeling in answering, not mine. Lucy is not likely to be there.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That would make no difference,\" Elwood answered. \"Do you suppose it is a pain for me to see her, because she seems lost to me? No; I\u0027m always a little encouraged when I have a chance to measure myself with her, and to guess—sometimes this and sometimes that—what it is that she needs to find in me. Force of will is of no use; as to faithfulness,—why, what it\u0027s worth can\u0027t be shown unless something turns up to try it. But you had better not ask me to be your groomsman. Neither Miss Blessing nor her sister would be overly pleased.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why so?\" Joseph asked; \"Julia and you are quite well acquainted, and she was always friendly towards you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Elwood was silent and embarrassed. Then, reflecting that silence, at that moment, might express even more than speech, he said: \"I\u0027ve got the notion in my head; maybe it\u0027s foolish, but there it is. I talked a good deal with Miss Blessing, it\u0027s true, and yet I don\u0027t feel the least bit acquainted. Her manner to me was very friendly, and yet I don\u0027t think she likes me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well!\" exclaimed Joseph, forcing a laugh, though he was much annoyed, \"I never gave you credit for such a lively imagination. Why not be candid, and admit that the dislike is on your side? I am sorry for it, since Julia will so soon be in the house there as my wife. There is no one else whom I can ask, unless it were Philip Held—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Held! To be sure, he took care of you. I was at Coventry the day after, and saw something of him.\" With these words, Elwood turned towards Joseph and looked him squarely in the face. \"He\u0027ll have charge there in a few months, I hear,\" he then said, \"and I reckon it as a piece of good luck for you. I\u0027ve found that there are men, all, maybe, as honest and outspoken as they need be; yet two of \u0027em will talk at different marks and never fully understand each other, and other two will naturally talk right straight at the same mark and never miss. Now, Held is the sort that can hit the thing in the mind of the man they\u0027re talking to; it\u0027s a gift that comes o\u0027 being knocked about the world among all classes of people. What we learn here, always among the same folks, isn\u0027t a circumstance.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then you think I might ask him?\" said Joseph, not fully comprehending all that Elwood meant to express. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He\u0027s one of those men that you\u0027re safe in asking to do anything. Make him spokesman of a committee to wait on the President, arbitrator in a crooked lawsuit, overseer of a railroad gang, leader in a prayer-meeting (if he\u0027d consent), or whatever else you choose, and he\u0027ll do the business as if he was used to it! It\u0027s enough for you that I don\u0027t know the town ways, and he does; it\u0027s considered worse, I\u0027ve heard, to make a blunder in society than to commit a real sin.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He rose, and they loitered down the hill together. The subject was quietly dropped, but the minds of both were none the less busy. They felt the stir and pressure of new experiences, which had come to one through disappointment and to the other through success. Not three months had passed since they rode together through the twilight to Warriner\u0027s, and already life was opening to them,—but how differently! Joseph endeavored to make the most kindly allowance for his friend\u0027s mood, and to persuade himself that his feelings were unchanged. Elwood, however, knew that a shadow had fallen between. It was nothing beside the cloud of his greater trouble: he also knew the cost of his own justification to Joseph, and prayed that it might never come. \\n\\n \\n\\n That evening, on taking leave, he said: \"I don\u0027t know whether you meant to have the news of your engagement circulated; but I guess Anna Warriner has heard, and that amounts to—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"To telling it to the whole neighborhood, doesn\u0027t it?\" Joseph answered. \"Then the mischief is already done, if it is a mischief. It is well, therefore, that the day is set: the neighborhood will have little time for gossip.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He smiled so frankly and cheerfully, that Elwood seized his hand, and with tears in his eyes, said: \"Don\u0027t remember anything against me, Joseph. I\u0027ve always been honestly your friend, and mean to stay so.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He went that evening to a homestead where he knew he should find Lucy Henderson. She looked pale and fatigued, he thought; possibly his presence had become a restraint. If so, she must bear his unkindness: it was the only sacrifice he could not make, for he felt sure that his intercourse with her must either terminate in hate or love. The one thing of which he was certain was, that there could be no calm, complacent friendship between them. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was not long before one of the family asked him whether he had heard the news; it seemed that they had already discussed it, and his arrival revived the flow of expression. In spite of his determination, he found it impossible to watch Lucy while he said, as simply as possible, that Joseph Asten seemed very happy over the prospect of the marriage; that he was old enough to take a wife; and if Miss Blessing could adapt herself to country habits, they might get on very well together. But later in the evening he took a chance of saying to her: \"In spite of what I said, Lucy, I don\u0027t feel quite easy about Joseph\u0027s marriage. What do you think of it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She smiled faintly, as she replied: \"Some say that people are attracted by mutual unlikeness. This seems to me to be a case of the kind; but they are free choosers of their own fates.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is there no possible way of persuading him—them—to delay?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No!\" she exclaimed, with unusual energy; \"none whatever!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Elwood sighed, and yet felt relieved. \\n\\n \\n\\n Joseph lost no time in writing to Philip Held, announcing his approaching marriage, and begging him—with many apologies for asking such a mark of confidence on so short an acquaintance—to act the part of nearest friend, if there were no other private reasons to prevent him. \\n\\n \\n\\n Four or five days later the following answer arrived:— \\n\\n \\n\\n My dear Asten:—Do you remember that curious whirling, falling sensation, when the car pitched over the edge of the embankment? I felt a return of it on reading your letter; for you have surprised me beyond measure. Not by your request, for that is just what I should have expected of you; and as well now, as if we had known each other for twenty years; so the apology is the only thing objectionable—But I am tangling my sentences; I want to say how heartily I return the feeling which prompted you to ask me, and yet how embarrassed I am that I cannot unconditionally say, \"Yes, with all my heart!\" My great, astounding surprise is, to find you about to be married to Miss Julia Blessing,—a young lady whom I once knew. And the embarrassment is this: I knew her under circumstances (in which she was not personally concerned, however) which might possibly render my presence now, as your groomsman, unwelcome to the family: at least, it is my duty—and yours, if you still desire me to stand beside you—to let Miss Blessing and her family decide the question. The circumstances to which I refer concern them rather than myself. I think your best plan will be simply to inform them of your request and my reply, and add that I am entirely ready to accept whatever course they may prefer. \\n\\n \\n\\n Pray don\u0027t consider that I have treated your first letter to me ungraciously. I am more grieved than you can imagine that it happens so. You will probably come to the city a day before the wedding, and I insist that you shall share my bachelor quarters, in any case. \\n\\n Always your friend, \\n\\n Philip Held. \\n\\n \\n\\n This letter threw Joseph into a new perplexity. Philip a former acquaintance of the Blessings! Formerly, but not now; and what could those mysterious \"circumstances\" have been, which had so seriously interrupted their intercourse? It was quite useless to conjecture; but he could not resist the feeling that another shadow hung over the aspects of his future. Perhaps he had exaggerated Elwood\u0027s unaccountable dislike to Julia, which had only been implied, not spoken; but here was a positive estrangement on the part of the man who was so suddenly near and dear to him. He never thought of suspecting Philip of blame; the candor and cheery warmth of the letter rejoiced his heart. There was evidently nothing better to do than to follow the advice contained in it, and leave the question to the decision of Julia and her parents. \\n\\n \\n\\n Her reply did not come by the return mail, nor until nearly a week afterwards; during which time he tormented himself by imagining the wildest reasons for her silence. When the letter at last arrived, he had some difficulty in comprehending its import. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Dearest Joseph,\" she said, \"you must really forgive me this long trial of your patience. Your letter was so unexpected,—I mean its contents,—and it seems as if ma and pa and Clementina would never agree what was best to be done. For that matter, I cannot say that they agree now; we had no idea that you were an intimate friend of Mr. Held, (I can\u0027t think how ever you should have become acquainted!) and it seems to break open old wounds,—none of mine, fortunately, for I have none. As Mr. Held leaves the question in our hands, there is, you will understand, all the more necessity that we should be careful. Ma thinks he has said nothing to you about the unfortunate occurrence, or you would have expressed an opinion. You never can know how happy your fidelity makes me; but I felt that, the first moment we met. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ma says that at very private (what pa calls informal) weddings there need not be bridesmaids or groomsmen. Miss Morrisey was married that way, not long ago; it is true that she is not of our circle, nor strictly a first family (this is ma\u0027s view, not mine, for I understand the hollowness of society); but we could very well do the same. Pa would be satisfied with a reception afterwards; he wants to ask the Collector, and the Surveyor, and the Appraiser. Clementina won\u0027t say anything now, but I know what she thinks, and so does ma; however, Mr. Held has so dropped out of city life that it is not important. I suppose everything must be dim in his memory now; you do not write to me much that he related. How strange that he should be your friend! They say my dress is lovely, but I am sure I should like a plain muslin just as well. I shall only breathe freely when I get back to the quiet of the country, (and your—our charming home, and dear, good Aunt Rachel!) and away from all these conventional forms. Ma says if there is one groomsman there ought to be two; either very simple, or according to custom. In a matter so delicate, perhaps, Mr. Held would be as competent to decide as we are; at least I am quite willing to leave it to his judgment. But how trifling is all this discussion, compared with the importance of the day to us! It is now drawing very near, but I have no misgivings, for I confide in you wholly and forever!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n After reading the letter with as much coolness as was then possible to him, Joseph inferred three things: that his acquaintance with Philip Held was not entirely agreeable to the Blessing family; that they would prefer the simplest style of a wedding, and this was in consonance with his own tastes; and that Julia clung to him as a deliverer from conditions with which her nature had little sympathy. Her incoherence, he fancied, arose from an agitation which he could very well understand, and his answer was intended to soothe and encourage her. It was difficult to let Philip know that his services would not be required, without implying the existence of an unfriendly feeling towards him; and Joseph, therefore, all the more readily accepted his invitation. He was assured that the mysterious difficulty did not concern Julia; even if it were so, he was not called upon to do violence, without cause, to so welcome a friendship. \\n\\n \\n\\n The September days sped by, not with the lingering, passionate uncertainty of which Elwood Withers spoke, but almost too swiftly. In the hurry of preparation, Joseph had scarcely time to look beyond the coming event and estimate its consequences. He was too ignorant of himself to doubt: his conscience was too pure and perfect to admit the possibility of changing the course of his destiny. Whatever the gossip of the neighborhood might have been, he heard nothing of it that was not agreeable. His aunt was entirely reconciled to a wife who would not immediately, and probably not for a long time, interfere with her authority; and the shadows raised by the two men whom he loved best seemed, at last, to be accidentally thrown from clouds beyond the horizon of his life. This was the thought to which he clung, in spite of a vague, utterly formless apprehension, which he felt lurking somewhere in the very bottom of his heart. \\n\\n \\n\\n Philip met him on his arrival in the city, and after taking him to his pleasant quarters, in a house looking on one of the leafy squares, good-naturedly sent him to the Blessing mansion, with a warning to return before the evening was quite spent. The family was in a flutter of preparation, and though he was cordially welcomed, he felt that, to all except Julia, he was subordinate in interest to the men who came every quarter of an hour, bringing bouquets, and silver spoons with cards attached, and pasteboard boxes containing frosted cakes. Even Julia\u0027s society he was only allowed to enjoy by scanty instalments; she was perpetually summoned by her mother or Clementina, to consult about some indescribable figment of dress. Mr. Blessing was occupied in the basement, with the inspection of various hampers. He came to the drawing-room to greet Joseph, whom he shook by both hands, with such incoherent phrases that Julia presently interposed. \"You must not forget, pa,\" she said, \"that the man is waiting: Joseph will excuse you, I know.\" She followed him to the basement, and he returned no more. \\n\\n \\n\\n Joseph left early in the evening, cheered by Julia\u0027s words: \"We can\u0027t complain of all this confusion, when it\u0027s for our sakes; but we\u0027ll be happier when it\u0027s over, won\u0027t we?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He gave her an affirmative kiss, and returned to Philip\u0027s room. That gentleman was comfortably disposed in an arm-chair, with a book and a cigar. \"Ah!\" he exclaimed, \"you find that a house is more agreeable any evening than that before the wedding?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There is one compensation,\" said Joseph; \"it gives me two or three hours with you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then take that other arm-chair, and tell me how this came to pass. You see I have the curiosity of a neighbor, already.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He listened earnestly while Joseph related the story of his love, occasionally asking a question or making a suggestive remark, but so gently that it seemed to come as an assistance. When all had been told, he rose and commenced walking slowly up and down the room. Joseph longed to ask, in turn, for an explanation of the circumstances mentioned in Philip\u0027s letter; but a doubt checked his tongue. \\n\\n \\n\\n As if in response to his thought, Philip stopped before him and said: \"I owe you my story, and you shall have it after a while, when I can tell you more. I was a young fellow of twenty when I knew the Blessings, and I don\u0027t attach the slightest importance, now, to anything that happened. Even if I did, Miss Julia had no share in it. I remember her distinctly; she was then about my age, or a year or two older; but hers is a face that would not change in a long while.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Joseph stared at his friend in silence. He recalled the latter\u0027s age, and was startled by the involuntary arithmetic which revealed Julia\u0027s to him. It was unexpected, unwelcome, yet inevitable. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Her father had been lucky in some of his \u0027operations,\u0027\" Philip continued, \"but I don\u0027t think he kept it long. I hardly wonder that she should come to prefer a quiet country life to such ups and downs as the family has known. Generally, a woman don\u0027t adapt herself so readily to a change of surroundings as a man: where there is love, however, everything is possible.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There is! there is!\" Joseph exclaimed, certifying the fact to himself as much as to his friend. He rose and stood beside him. \\n\\n \\n\\n Philip looked at him with grave, tender eyes. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What can I do?\" he said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What should you do?\" Joseph asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"This!\" Philip exclaimed, laying his hands on Joseph\u0027s shoulders,—\"this, Joseph! I can be nearer than a brother. I know that I am in your heart as you are in mine. There is no faith between us that need be limited, there is no truth too secret to be veiled. A man\u0027s perfect friendship is rarer than a woman\u0027s love, and most hearts are content with one or the other: not so with yours and mine! I read it in your eyes, when you opened them on my knee: I see it in your face now. Don\u0027t speak: let us clasp hands.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But Joseph could not speak. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1815/52723.html","bookId":1041,"book":{"id":1041,"title":"Joseph and His Friend","description":"简介： Rachel Miller was not a little surprised when her nephew Joseph came to the supper-table, not from the direction of the barn and through the kitchen, as usual, but from the back room up stairs, where he slept.
