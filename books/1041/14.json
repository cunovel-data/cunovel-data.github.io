{"id":16280,"no":14,"title":"CHAPTER XIV. THE AMARANTH.","content":"Clementina returned to the city without having made any very satisfactory discovery. Her parting was therefore conventionally tender: she even thanked Joseph for his hospitality, and endeavored to throw a little natural emphasis into her words as she expressed the hope of being allowed to renew her visit in the summer. \n \n During her stay it seemed to Joseph that the early harmony of his household had been restored. Julia\u0027s manner had been so gentle and amiable, that, on looking back, he was inclined to believe that the loneliness of her new life was alone responsible for any change. But after Clementina\u0027s departure his doubts were reawakened in a more threatening form. He could not guess, as yet, the terrible chafing of a smiling mask; of a restraint which must not only conceal itself, but counterfeit its opposite; of the assumption by a narrow, cold, and selfish nature of virtues which it secretly despises. He could not have foreseen that the gentleness, which had nearly revived his faith in her, would so suddenly disappear. But it was gone, like a glimpse of the sun through the winter fog. The hard, watchful expression came back to Julia\u0027s face; the lowered eyelids no longer gave a fictitious depth to her shallow, tawny pupils; the soft roundness of her voice took on a frequent harshness, and the desire of asserting her own will in all things betrayed itself through her affected habits of yielding and seeking counsel. \n \n She continued her plan of making herself acquainted with all the details of the farm business. When the roads began to improve, in the early spring, she insisted in driving to the village alone, and Joseph soon found that she made good use of these journeys in extending her knowledge of the social and pecuniary standing of all the neighboring families. She talked with farmers, mechanics, and drovers; became familiar with the fluctuations in the prices of grain and cattle; learned to a penny the wages paid for every form of service; and thus felt, from week to week, the ground growing more secure under her feet. \n \n Joseph was not surprised to see that his aunt\u0027s participation in the direction of the household gradually diminished. Indeed, he scarcely noticed the circumstance at all, but he was at last forced to remark her increasing silence and the trouble of her face. To all appearance the domestic harmony was perfect, and if Rachel Miller felt some natural regret at being obliged to divide her sway, it was a matter, he thought, wherein he had best not interfere. One day, however, she surprised him by the request:— \n \n \"Joseph, can you take or send me to Magnolia to-morrow?\" \n \n \"Certainly, Aunt!\" he replied. \"I suppose you want to visit Cousin Phebe; you have not seen her since last summer.\" \n \n \"It was that,—and something more.\" She paused a moment, and then added, more firmly: \"She has always wished that I should make my home with her, but I couldn\u0027t think of any change so long as I was needed here. It seems to me that I am not really needed now.\" \n \n \"Why, Aunt Rachel!\" Joseph exclaimed, \"I meant this to be your home always, as much as mine! Of course you are needed,—not to do all that you have done heretofore, but as a part of the family. It is your right.\" \n \n \"I understand all that, Joseph. But I\u0027ve heard it said that a young wife should learn to see to everything herself, and Julia, I\u0027m sure, doesn\u0027t need either my help or my advice.\" \n \n Joseph\u0027s face became very grave. \"Has she—has she—?\" he stammered. \n \n \"No,\" said Rachel, \"she has not said it—in words. Different persons have different ways. She is quick, O very quick!—and capable. You know I could never sit idly by, and look on; and it\u0027s hard to be directed. I seem to belong to the place and everything connected with it; yet there\u0027s times when what a body ought to do is plain.\" \n \n In endeavoring to steer a middle course between her conscience and her tender regard for her nephew\u0027s feelings Rachel only confused and troubled him. Her words conveyed something of the truth which she sought to hide under them. She was both angered and humiliated; the resistance with which she had attempted to meet Julia\u0027s domestic innovations was no match for the latter\u0027s tactics; it had gone down like a barrier of reeds and been contemptuously trampled under foot. She saw herself limited, opposed, and finally set aside by a cheerful dexterity of management which evaded her grasp whenever she tried to resent it. Definite acts, whereon to base her indignation, seemed to slip from her memory, but the atmosphere of the house became fatal to her. She felt this while she spoke, and felt also that Joseph must be spared. \n \n \"Aunt Rachel,\" said he, \"I know that Julia is very anxious to learn everything which she thinks belongs to her place,—perhaps a little more than is really necessary. She\u0027s an enthusiastic nature, you know. Maybe you are not fully acquainted yet; maybe you have misunderstood her in some things: I would like to think so.\" \n \n \"It is true that we are different, Joseph,—very different. I don\u0027t say, therefore, that I\u0027m always right. It\u0027s likely, indeed, that any young wife and any old housekeeper like myself would have their various notions. But where there can be only one head, it\u0027s the wife\u0027s place to be that head. Julia has not asked it of me, but she has the right. I can\u0027t say, also, that I don\u0027t need a little rest and change, and there seems to be some call on me to oblige Phebe. Look at the matter in the true light,\" she continued, seeing that Joseph remained silent, \"and you must feel that it\u0027s only natural.\" \n \n \"I hope so,\" he said at last, repressing a sigh; \"all things are changing.\" \n \n \"What can we do?\" Julia asked, that evening, when he had communicated to her his aunt\u0027s resolution; \"it would be so delightful if she would stay, and yet I have had a presentiment that she would leave us—for a little while only, I hope. Dear, good Aunt Rachel! I couldn\u0027t help seeing how hard it was for her to allow the least change in the order of housekeeping. She would be perfectly happy if I would sit still all day and let her tire herself to death; but how can I do that, Joseph? And no two women have exactly the same ways and habits. I\u0027ve tried to make everything pleasant for her: if she would only leave many little matters entirely to me, or at least not think of them,—but I fear she cannot. She manages to see the least that I do, and secretly worries about it, in the very kindness of her heart. Why can\u0027t women carry on partnerships in housekeeping as men do in business? I suppose we are too particular; perhaps I am just as much so as Aunt Rachel. I have no doubt she thinks a little hardly of me, and so it would do her good—we should really come nearer again—if she had a change. If she will go, Joseph, she must at least leave us with the feeling that our home is always hers, whenever she chooses to accept it.\" \n \n Julia bent over Joseph\u0027s chair, gave him a rapid kiss, and then went off to make her peace with Aunt Rachel. When the two women came to the tea-table the latter had an uncertain, bewildered air, while the eyelids of the former were red,—either from tears or much rubbing. \n \n A fortnight afterwards Rachel Miller left the farm and went to reside with her widowed niece, in Magnolia. \n \n The day after her departure another surprise came to Joseph in the person of his father-in-law. Mr. Blessing arrived in a hired vehicle from the station. His face was so red and radiant from the March winds, and perhaps some private source of satisfaction, that his sudden arrival could not possibly be interpreted as an omen of ill-fortune. He shook hands with the Irish groom who had driven him over, gave him a handsome gratuity in addition to the hire of the team, extracted an elegant travelling-satchel from under the seat, and met Joseph at the gate, with a breezy burst of feeling:— \n \n \"God bless you, son-in-law! It does my heart good to see you again! And then, at last, the pleasure of beholding your ancestral seat; really, this is quite—quite manorial!\" \n \n Julia, with a loud cry of \"O pa!\" came rushing from the house. \n \n \"Bless me, how wild and fresh the child looks!\" cried Mr. Blessing, after the embrace. \"Only see the country roses on her cheeks! Almost too young and sparkling for Lady Asten, of Asten Hall, eh? As Dryden says, \u0027Happy, happy, happy pair!\u0027 It takes me back to the days when I was a gay young lark; but I must have a care, and not make an old fool of myself. Let us go in and subside into soberness: I am ready both to laugh and cry.\" \n \n When they were seated in the comfortable front room, Mr. Blessing opened his satchel and produced a large leather-covered flask. Julia was probably accustomed to his habits, for she at once brought a glass from the sideboard. \n \n \"I am still plagued with my old cramps,\" her father said to Joseph, as he poured out a stout dose. \"Physiologists, you know, have discovered that stimulants diminish the wear and tear of life, and I find their theories correct. You, in your pastoral isolation and pecuniary security, can form no conception of the tension under which we men of office and of the world live, Beatus ille, and so forth,—strange that the only fragment of Latin which I remember should be so appropriate! A little water, if you please, Julia.\" \n \n In the evening, when Mr. Blessing, slippered, sat before the open fireplace, with a cigar in his mouth, the object of his sudden visit crept by slow degrees to the light. \"Have you been dipping into oil?\" he asked Joseph. \n \n Julia made haste to reply. \"Not yet, but almost everybody in the neighborhood is ready to do so now, since Clemson has realized his fifty thousand dollars in a single year. They are talking of nothing else in the village. I heard yesterday, Joseph, that Old Bishop has taken three thousand dollars\u0027 worth of stock in a new company.\" \n \n \"Take my advice, and don\u0027t touch \u0027em!\" exclaimed Mr. Blessing. \n \n \"I had not intended to,\" said Joseph. \n \n \"There is this thing about these excitements,\" Mr. Blessing continued: \"they never reach the rural districts until the first sure harvest is over. The sharp, intelligent operators in the large cities—the men who are ready to take up soap, thimbles, hand-organs, electricity, or hymn-books, at a moment\u0027s notice—always cut into a new thing before its value is guessed by the multitude. Then the smaller fry follow and secure their second crop, while your quiet men in the country are shaking their heads and crying \u0027humbug!\u0027 Finally, when it really gets to be a humbug, in a speculative sense, they just begin to believe in it, and are fair game for the bummers and camp-followers of the financial army. I respect Clemson, though I never heard of him before; as for Old Bishop, he may be a very worthy man, but he\u0027ll never see the color of his three thousand dollars again.\" \n \n \"Pa!\" cried Julia, \"how clear you do make everything. And to think that I was wishing—O, wishing so much!—that Joseph would go into oil.\" \n \n She hung her head a little, looking at Joseph with an affectionate, penitent glance. A quick gleam of satisfaction passed over Mr. Blessing\u0027s face; he smiled to himself, puffed rapidly at his cigar for a minute, and then resumed: \"In such a field of speculation everything depends on being initiated. There are men in the city—friends of mine—who know every foot of ground in the Alleghany Valley. They can smell oil, if it\u0027s a thousand feet deep. They never touch a thing that isn\u0027t safe,—but, then, they know what\u0027s safe. In spite of the swindling that\u0027s going on, it takes years to exhaust the good points; just so sure as your honest neighbors here will lose, just so sure will these friends of mine gain. There are millions in what they have under way, at this moment.\" \n \n \"What is it?\" Julia breathlessly asked, while Joseph\u0027s face betrayed that his interest was somewhat aroused. \n \n Mr. Blessing unlocked his satchel, and took from it a roll of paper, which he began to unfold upon his knee. \"Here,\" he said, \"you see this bend of the river, just about the centre of the oil region, which is represented by the yellow color. These little dots above the bend are the celebrated Fluke Wells; the other dots below are the equally celebrated Chowder Wells. The distance between the two is nearly three miles. Here is an untouched portion of the treasure,—a pocket of Pactolus waiting to be rifled. A few of us have acquired the land, and shall commence boring immediately.\" \n \n \"But,\" said Joseph, \"it seems to me that either the attempt must have been made already, or that the land must command such an enormous price as to lessen the profits.\" \n \n \"Wisely spoken! It is the first question which would occur to any prudent mind. But what if I say that neither is the case? And you, who are familiar with the frequent eccentricities of old farmers, can understand the explanation. The owner of the land was one of your ignorant, stubborn men, who took such a dislike to the prospectors and speculators, that he refused to let them come near him. Both the Fluke and Chowder Companies tried their best to buy him out, but he had a malicious pleasure in leading them on to make immense offers, and then refusing. Well, a few months ago he died, and his heirs were willing enough to let the land go; but before it could be regularly offered for sale, the Fluke and Chowder Wells began to flow less and less. Their shares fell from 270 to 95; the supposed value of the land fell with them, and finally the moment arrived when we could purchase for a very moderate sum. I see the question in your mind; why should we wish to buy when the other wells were giving out? There comes in the secret, which is our veritable success. Consider it whispered in your ears, and locked in your bosoms,—torpedoes! It was not then generally exploded (to carry out the image), so we bought at the low figure, in the very nick of time. Within a week the Fluke and Chowder Wells were torpedoed, and came back to more than their former capacity; the shares rose as rapidly as they had fallen, and the central body we hold—to which they are, as it were, the two arms—could now be sold for ten times what it cost us!\" \n \n Here Mr. Blessing paused, with his finger on the map, and a light of merited triumph in his eyes. Julia clapped her hands, sprang to her feet, and cried: \"Trumps at last!\" \n \n \"Ay,\" said he, \"wealth, repose for my old days,—wealth for us all, if your husband will but take the hand I hold out to him. You now know, son-in-law, why the endorsement you gave me was of such vital importance; the note, as you are aware, will mature in another week. Why should you not charge yourself with the payment, in consideration of the transfer to you of shares of the original stock, already so immensely appreciated in value? I have delayed making any provision, for the sake of offering you the chance.\" \n \n Julia was about to speak, but restrained herself with an apparent effort. \n \n \"I should like to know,\" Joseph said, \"who are associated with you in the undertaking?\" \n \n \"Well done, again! Where did you get your practical shrewdness? The best men in the city!—not only the Collector and the Surveyor, but Congressman Whaley, E. D. Stokes, of Stokes, Pirricutt and Company, and even the Reverend Doctor Lellifant. If I had not been an old friend of Kanuck, the agent who negotiated the purchase, my chance would have been impalpably small. I have all the documents with me. There has been no more splendid opportunity since oil became a power! I hesitate to advise even one so near to me in such matters; but if you knew the certainties as I know them, you would go in with all your available capital. The excitement, as you say, has reached the country communities, which are slow to rise and equally slow to subside; all oil stock will be in demand, but the Amaranth,—\u0027The Blessing,\u0027 they wished to call it, but I was obliged to decline, for official reasons,—the Amaranth shares will be the golden apex of the market!\" \n \n Julia looked at Joseph with eager, hungry eyes. He, too, was warmed and tempted by the prospect of easy profit which the scheme held out to him; only the habit of his nature resisted, but with still diminishing force. \"I might venture the thousand,\" he said. \n \n \"It is no venture!\" Julia cried. \"In all the speculations I have heard discussed by pa and his friends, there was nothing so admirably managed as this. Such a certainty of profit may never come again. If you will be advised by me, Joseph, you will take shares to the amount of five or ten thousand.\" \n \n \"Ten thousand is exactly the amount I hold open,\" Mr. Blessing gravely remarked. \"That, however, does not represent the necessary payment, which can hardly amount to more than twenty-five per cent. before we begin to realize. Only ten per cent. has yet been called, so that your thousand at present will secure you an investment of ten thousand. Really, it seems like a fortunate coincidence.\" \n \n He went on, heating himself with his own words, until the possibilities of the case grew so splendid that Joseph felt himself dazzled and bewildered. Mr. Blessing was a master in the art of seductive statement. Even where he was only the mouthpiece of another, a few repetitions led him to the profoundest belief. Here there could be no doubt of his sincerity, and, moreover, every movement from the very inception of the scheme, every statistical item, all collateral influences, were clear in his mind and instantly accessible. Although he began by saying, \"I will make no estimate of the profits, because it is not prudent to fix our hopes on a positive sum,\" he was soon carried far away from this resolution, and most luxuriously engaged, pencil in hand, in figuring out results which drove Julia wild with desire, and almost took away Joseph\u0027s breath. The latter finally said, as they rose from the session, late at night:— \n \n \"It is settled that I take as much as the thousand will cover; but I would rather think over the matter quietly for a day or two before venturing further.\" \n \n \"You must,\" replied Mr. Blessing, patting him on the shoulder. \"These things are so new to your experience, that they disturb and—I might almost say—alarm you. It is like bringing an increase of oxygen into your mental atmosphere. (Ha! a good figure: for the result will be, a richer, fuller life. I must remember it.) But you are a healthy organization, and therefore you are certain to see clearly: I can wait with confidence.\" \n \n The next morning Joseph, without declaring his purpose, drove to Coventry Forge to consult Philip. Mr. Blessing and Julia, remaining at home, went over the shining ground again, and yet again, confirming each other in the determination to secure it. Even Joseph, as he passed up the valley in the mild March weather, taking note of the crimson and gold of the flowering spice-bushes and maple-trees, could not prevent his thoughts from dwelling on the delights of wealth,—society, books, travel, and all the mellow, fortunate expansion of life. Involuntarily, he hoped that Philip\u0027s counsel might coincide with his father-in-law\u0027s offer. \n \n But Philip was not at home. The forge was in full activity, the cottage on the knoll was repainted and made attractive in various ways, and Philip would soon return with his sister to establish a permanent home. Joseph found the sign-spiritual of his friend in numberless little touches and changes; it seemed to him that a new soul had entered into the scenery of the place. \n \n A mile or two farther up the valley, a company of mechanics and laborers were apparently tearing the old Calvert mansion inside out. House, barn, garden, and lawn were undergoing a complete transformation. While he paused at the entrance of the private lane, to take a survey of the operations, Mr. Clemson rode down to him from the house. The Hopetons, he said, would migrate from the city early in May: work had already commenced on the new railway, and in another year a different life would come upon the whole neighborhood. \n \n In the course of the conversation Joseph ventured to sound Mr. Clemson in regard to the newly formed oil companies. The latter frankly confessed that he had withdrawn from further speculation, satisfied with his fortune; he preferred to give no opinion, further than that money was still to be made, if prudently placed. Tho Fluke and Chowder Wells, he said, were old, well known, and profitable. The new application of torpedoes had restored their failing flow, and the stock had recovered from its temporary depreciation. His own venture had been made in another part of the region. \n \n The atmosphere into which Joseph entered, on returning home, took away all further power of resistance. Tempted already, and impressed by what he had learned, he did what his wife and father-in-law desired. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1815/52727.html","bookId":1041,"book":{"id":1041,"title":"Joseph and His Friend","description":"简介： Rachel Miller was not a little surprised when her nephew Joseph came to the supper-table, not from the direction of the barn and through the kitchen, as usual, but from the back room up stairs, where he slept.
