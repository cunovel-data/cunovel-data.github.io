{"id":16300,"no":34,"title":"CHAPTER XXXIII. ALL ARE HAPPY.","content":"Three weeks after the date of Joseph\u0027s last letter Philip met him at the railroad station in the city. Brown, bearded, fresh, and full of joyous life after his seven days\u0027 journey across the continent, he sprang down from the platform to be caught in his friend\u0027s arms. The next morning they went together to Mr. Blessing\u0027s residence. That gentleman still wore a crimson velvet dressing-gown, and the odor of the cigar, which he puffed in a rear room, called the library (the books were mostly Patent Office and Agricultural Reports, with Faublas and the Decamerone), breathed plainly of the Vuelte Abajo. \"My dear boy!\" he cried, jumping up and extending his arms, \"Asten of Asten Hall! After all your moving accidents by flood and field; back again! This is—is—what shall I say? compensation for many a blow of fate! And my brave Knight with the Iron Hand, sit down, though it be in Carthage, and let me refresh my eyes with your faces!\" \"Not Carthage yet, I hope,\" said Joseph. \"Not quite, if I adhere strictly to facts,\" Mr. Blessing replied; \"although it threatens to be my Third Punic War. \"There is even a slight upward tendency in the Amaranth shares, and if the company were in my hands, we should soon float upon the topmost wave. But what can I do? The Honorable Whaley and the Reverend Dr. Lellifant were retained on account of their names; Whaley made president, and I—being absent at the time developing the enterprise, not only pars magna but totus teres atque rotundus, ha! ha!—I was put off with a director\u0027s place. Now I must stand by, and see the work of my hands overthrown. But \u0027tis ever thus!\" He heaved a deep sigh. Philip, most heroically repressing a tendency to shriek with laughter, drew him on to state the particulars, and soon discovered, as he had already suspected, that Mr. Blessing\u0027s sanguine temperament was the real difficulty; it was still possible for him to withdraw, and secure a moderate success. When this had been made clear, Joseph interposed. \"Mr. Blessing,\" said he, \"I cannot forget how recklessly, in my disappointment, I charged you with dishonesty. I know also that you have not forgotten it. Will you give me an opportunity of atoning for my injustice?—not that you require it, but that I may, henceforth, have less cause for self-reproach.\" \"Your words are enough!\" Mr. Blessing exclaimed. \"I excused you long ago. You, in your pastoral seclusion—\" \"But I have not been secluded for eighteen months past,\" said Joseph, smiling. \"It is the better knowledge of men which has opened my eyes. Besides, you have no right to refuse me; it is Mrs. Blessing whom I shall have to consult.\" He laid the papers on the table, explaining that half the amount realized from his shares of the Amaranth had been invested, on trust, for the benefit of Mrs. Eliza Blessing. \"You have conquered—vincisti!\" cried Mr. Blessing, shedding tears. \"What can I do? Generosity is so rare a virtue in the world, that it would be a crime to suppress it!\" Philip took advantage of the milder mood, and plied his arguments so skilfully that at last the exuberant pride of the De Belsain blood gave way. \"What shall I do, without an object,—a hope, a faith in possibilities?\" Mr. Blessing cried. \"The amount you have estimated, with Joseph\u0027s princely provision, is a competence for my old days; but how shall I fill out those days? The sword that is never drawn from the scabbard rusts.\" \"But,\" said Philip, gravely, \"you forget the field for which you were destined by nature. These operations in stocks require only a low order of intellect; you were meant to lead and control multitudes of men. With your fluency of speech, your happy faculty of illustration, your power of presenting facts and probabilities, you should confine yourself exclusively to the higher arena of politics. Begin as an Alderman; then, a Member of the Assembly; then, the State Senate; then—\" \"Member of Congress!\" cried Mr. Blessing, rising, with flushed face and flashing eyes. \"You are right! I have allowed the necessity of the moment to pull me down from my proper destiny! You are doubly right! My creature comforts once secured, I can give my time, my abilities, my power of swaying the minds of men,—come, let us withdraw, realize, consolidate, invest, at once!\" They took him at his word, and before night a future, free from want, was secured to him. While Philip and Joseph were on their way to the country by a late train, Mr. Blessing was making a speech of an hour and a half at one of the primary political meetings. There was welcome through the valley when Joseph\u0027s arrival was known. For two or three days the neighbors flocked to the farm to see the man whose adventures, in a very marvellous form, had been circulating among them for a year past. Even Mr. Chaffinch called, and was so conciliated by his friendly reception, that he, thenceforth, placed Joseph in the ranks of those \"impracticable\" men, who might be nearer the truth than they seemed: it was not for us to judge. Every evening, however, Joseph took his saddle-horse and rode up the valley to Philip\u0027s Forge. It was not only the inexpressible charm of the verdure to which he had so long been a stranger,—not only the richness of the sunset on the hills, the exquisite fragrance of the meadow-grasses in the cool air,—nay, not entirely the dear companionship of Philip which drew him thither. A sentiment so deep and powerful that it was yet unrecognized,—a hope so faint that it had not yet taken form,—was already in his heart. Philip saw, and was silent. But, one night, when the moon hung over the landscape, edging with sparkling silver the summits of the trees below them, when the air was still and sweet and warm, and filled with the diffused murmurs of the stream, and Joseph and Madeline stood side by side, on the curving shoulder of the knoll, Philip, watching them from the open window, said to himself: \"They are swiftly coming to the knowledge of each other; will it take Joseph further from my heart, or bring him nearer? It ought to fill me with perfect joy, yet there is a little sting of pain somewhere. My life had settled down so peacefully into what seemed a permanent form; with Madeline to make a home and brighten it for me, and Joseph to give me the precious intimacy of a man\u0027s love, so different from woman\u0027s, yet so pure and perfect! They have destroyed my life, although they do not guess it. Well, I must be vicariously happy, warmed in my lonely sphere by the far radiation of their nuptial bliss, seeing a faint reflection of some parts of myself in their children, nay, claiming and making them mine as well, if it is meant that my own blood should not beat in other hearts. But will this be sufficient? No! either sex is incomplete alone, and a man\u0027s full life shall be mine! Ah, you unconscious lovers, you simple-souled children, that know not what you are doing, I shall be even with you in the end! The world is a failure, God\u0027s wonderful system is imperfect, if there is not now living a noble woman to bless me with her love, strengthen me with her self-sacrifice, purify me with her sweeter and clearer faith! I will wait: but I shall find her!\" The End","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1815/52747.html","bookId":1041,"book":{"id":1041,"title":"Joseph and His Friend","description":"简介： Rachel Miller was not a little surprised when her nephew Joseph came to the supper-table, not from the direction of the barn and through the kitchen, as usual, but from the back room up stairs, where he slept.
